21W.777 The Science Essay    
 
 
Leading Class Discussion of Readings 
 
Your aim 
Your goal is not to critique this essay; it’s to uncover as much meaning and technique as 
you can, and engage classmates in considering the writer’s ideas: What are these ideas? 
Why might they matter? What would it mean if they were true?  
 
Preliminaries 
•  Tell or remind the class who the author is (Scientist? Science writer? Novelist? 
Etc.). 
•  Note the main contexts in which the author wants us to consider his or her ideas; 
if you have additional personal contexts, note those as well (e.g.: my family had a 
summer camping experience exactly like the one described in this essay…; I just 
read an article for another class on a similar topic…). 
•  Note the title of the essay and what it leads us to expect. 

 
Getting into the essay 
•  Note what you think is the writer’s main idea, and her or his purpose in writing 
the essay. Ask the class: Do you agree? Disagree? Do you want to qualify or 
modify the idea and purpose? You and the class should use evidence from the text 
to support claims. 
•  Be ready with 3 elements of the text that you want to bring to our attention—
structure, language, metaphors, tone, use of expert testimony, etc., etc.  
o  Why are these elements noteworthy?—that is, why do you think they 
stood out for you?, and  
o  How are they linked to meaning in the essay? –you can ask the class to 
chime in on this. 
•  Prepare 3 questions related to the content and purpose of the essay that you would 
like the class to discuss. These may be aspects of the essay that puzzle you, 
questions that the author raises, points that you disagree with (or think you do), 
questions that the essay raises for you . . ..  

 
Wrap up 
•  Do have any final comments, or new questions, either about writing essays or 
about the ideas posed by the writer? 
I will also chime in here if there’s a particular point or two I want to make.
