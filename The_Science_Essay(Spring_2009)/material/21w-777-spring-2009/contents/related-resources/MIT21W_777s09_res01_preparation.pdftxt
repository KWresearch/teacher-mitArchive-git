•  Plan to meet with me for 10 minutes or so to go over your discussion sheets no 
later than the day before your discussion. If you are presenting as a team, you 
may prepare the sheet together and meet with me together. 

 
Title 
What does the title of the essay lead us to expect and/or how does it sum up the meaning 
of the essay? 
 
Thesis 
In 1-2 sentences, state the thesis of the essay. This may be a direct quote or your own 
paraphrase. Remember that the thesis (the “idea” as per my Resource sheet) should 
account for the most, and the most important, meaning in the essay. 
 
Context 
Name two or more contexts in which the idea matters. 
 
Rhetoric 
List 3 noteworthy elements of this essay’s style and structure (you can use bullet points).  
 
Getting into it 
List 4 open-ended questions for the discussion that you will lead—i.e., questions that 
don’t have a yes/no or short-phrase answer. For example, “Why do you think 
Featherstone introduces the idea of the warrior spirit at this point in his essay,” or “What 
does the warrior spirit have to do with using robots in war?”
