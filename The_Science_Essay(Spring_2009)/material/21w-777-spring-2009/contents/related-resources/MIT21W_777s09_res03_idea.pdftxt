IDEA AND ESSAY 
 
An idea that shapes an essay (also known as a thesis) is a statement that generalizes: 
“Loneliness” is not an idea—it’s a topic (What about loneliness? That’s your idea.) 
 
“I feel lonely in New York” is not an idea. 
 
 
“Loneliness  is a  strange gift”  (E.B. White, “Here  is New York”)  is an  idea worth writing 
and  reading  about,  because  it  is  unexpected.  (“No  one  likes  to  be  lonely”  is  an  idea,  but  not  a 
promising one for an essay because it is so commonplace.) 
 
 .  .  .  and  it  is  a  statement  that  has  consequences  for  the  way  we  understand  the  world  and 
our lives: 
“Supermarkets  are  bigger  than  delis,”  while  it  is  a  statement  that  generalizes,  is  not  an 
idea. It is a fact. Statements of fact are too narrow in scope to be ideas. 
 
A statement that’s an idea posits a connection, a relationship, between two or more things: 
“Uncertainty  in  life  is  like  ambiguity  in  art.”  (Student  essay,  my  re-phrasing  of  the 
student’s idea) 
 
This kind of idea, or thesis, is always arguable. “Creativity comes in many forms,” like “War is 
Hell,” makes  a poor  thesis—Who would  find  this  idea unexpected?    It  is  the work of  an  essay  to 
argue  or  explore  an  idea,  to  try*  to  prove  it  or  help  us  see  it  more  clearly.  In  your  essay’s  main 
idea something must be at stake. (*Essay comes from the French essayer, to try.) 
 
How  you  state  your  idea  matters.  State  it  differently,  and  it  becomes  a  different  idea,  with 
different  implications. That  is, words,  phrases,  syntax—the way  a  thesis  sentence  is  structured—
contain  the  germ  of  your  whole  essay.  Unlike  a  topic,  an  idea  is  not  a  “ballpark”  thing—it  is  a 
very specific thing. For example, “Ambiguity in art is like uncertainty in life” shifts the emphasis 
of  the  idea  stated  above—now  art  seems  to  be  the  primary  area  of  concern,  whereas  in  the 
original statement life seems to be the primary area of concern. Similarly, 
 
 
or 
 
 
is not incompatible with 
 

“Swearing an oath of allegiance to a new country can create conflicts.”  

“Consumption is sometimes a good thing and sometimes a bad thing.” 

“Becoming  an American  citizen makes  you  a  new man;  it  can  also make  you  feel  like  a 
traitor.” (Student essay, my re-phrasing of the student’s idea) 

or 
 

“People  who  live  to  shop,  rather  than  shop  to  live,  may  be  creating  more  problems  for 
themselves than they are solving when they set out for the mall.” 

 
But note how  the  second  statements are more vivid and  suggest certain  lines of argument, even a 
tone, while  the first statements are bland. Would you want  to read an essay whose  thesis was one 
of the first statements? Not likely.  
 
To  sum  up: When  we  talk  about  figuring  out  what  our  idea  is  in  a  given  essay,  we  don’t mean 
settling on the essay’s topic. We mean articulating a relationship between two or more things in a 
way  that  holds  the  potential  for  a  lively  exploration  or  argument. We want  our  idea  statement  to 
be  clear  but  also  to  be  suggestive—it  is  a  seed,  a  kernel,  that  already  has  packed within  it  all  the 
meaning that sprouts, branches, and flowers through the rest of your essay. This is true even if we 
are writing an exploratory essay that doesn’t contain a traditional thesis statement. We should still 
be able to express our idea in this clear and complete way, as many of you do on the cover sheets 
for your drafts.
