***** Course Description *****
The science essay uses science to think about the human condition; it uses
humanistic thinking to reflect on the possibilities and limits of science and
technology. In this class we read and practice writing science essays of varied
lengths and purposes. We will read a wide variety of science essays, ranging
across disciplines, both to learn more about this genre and to inspire your own
writing. This semester's reading centers on "The Dark Side," with essays
ranging from Alan Lightman's "Prisoner of the Wired World" through Robin
Marantz Henig's cautionary account of nano-technology ("Our Silver-Coated
Future") to David Quammen's investigation of diseases that jump from animals to
humans ("Deadly Contact").
