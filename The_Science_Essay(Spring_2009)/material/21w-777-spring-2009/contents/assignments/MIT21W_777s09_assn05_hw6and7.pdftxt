21W.777 The Science Essay - Spring 2009 
 
Due Th 2/26 
Homework #6 
 
         
 
 
 
 
 
READ our 3rd set of essays, all in Groopman. Each of these essays has a “dark side” 
aspect, so consider that as you read them: how do emotion and reason interact in the 
effects the writers create, and in your own reading? Also notice the ways the writers 
explain the relevant science: how do they make it clear? The readings are: 
•  Christopher J. Conselice, “The Universe’s Invisible Hand,” 39-47. 
•  Freeman Dyson, “Our Biotech Future,” 64-74. 
•  Robin Marantz Henig, “Our Silver-Coated Future,” 119-131.

Homework #7 
 
 
 
 
1)   
READ our 4th set of essays, in Groopman:  
•  Steve Featherstone, “The Coming Robot Army,” 75-92. 
•  Ron Rosenbaum, “How To Trick an Online Scammer into Carving a Computer out of 
Wood,” 252-262. 
Both these essays have an ethical dimension, so think about how the writers frame their 
discussions—how do they get us to think about the ethical questions? Do they present 
their own judgments, or . . . ?

Essay 2   Draft 2 

REVISE Essay 2. Aim for “lucidity, lucidity, lucidity,” as Elise Hancock puts it. 
Also keep in mind that to revise means to re-see; allow yourself to re-see your essay and 
its possibilities—don’t be content to merely edit or polish it.  
 
When you hand in your revision, please include the first draft with my comments and a 
cover sheet answering these questions:
