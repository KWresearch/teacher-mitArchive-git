21W.777 The Science Essay    
                    
Homework #21      
 
1)  BRING to class your marked up copies of Essay 2, 3 or 4—whichever one you’d like to start re-
revising or polishing. As a way to begin thinking about revision, I’d like everyone to read 2 
versions of Rachel’s Essay #2 and to consider which you think works best, and why. We’ll start 
class by discussing this essay. I’ll bring copies of the essay to class.  
 
2)  REVISE Essay 5. Take your time. Consider you core reader, and the story you want to tell. Make 
your essay complete. Include all sources in parens. for my benefit. Work important sources into 
your sentences; include a few quotes so that we hear voices other than your own. Motivate your 
discussion for readers: make sure they know why it matters. Make sure that your Title, Inquiry 
Question and Thesis; your Introduction and Conclusion; and your transitions, images, etc., all 
work together to give your essay an effective shape. 

Here’s the Cover Sheet for your revision. Also turn in the first draft w/my comments and your 
free-write on core reader and story.
