REVISE Essay 4. Think especially about:

•  providing a theme or a bit of a longer discussion of one of the book’s points, so as to 
help readers see the book as interesting in a particular context; and, 
•  polishing your prose, especially the language in which you evaluate your author and 
his or her work.
