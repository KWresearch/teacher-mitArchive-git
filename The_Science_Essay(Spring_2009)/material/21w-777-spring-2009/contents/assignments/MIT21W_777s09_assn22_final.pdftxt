Re-revise/polish Essay 5. Assemble Portfolio. Write Portfolio Cover Letter. 
 
 
 
For our final two class meetings: 
Please bring 1-2 paragraphs of writing from a science essay that strikes you as especially 
good. Prepare to read it aloud and explain what you value in the writing. Your excerpt 
may be from something we've read from class, or not. 
 
Also bring 1-2 pages of your own work that you especially like and be prepared to read 
that aloud in class. 
 
We will share these during our last two sessions.

Essay ________ 

 
Name: _________________________ 
 
Before you submit a re-revised draft, make sure your essay has a clear thesis, and that 
the writing is as clear and enjoyable to read as you can make it. In addition, proofread 
it for typos and errors. If you hand in a re-revision before the Portfolio, include just 
the previous draft of the essay and the cover sheet. (In the Portfolio, include all drafts 
& Cover Sheet.) 
 
1)  What has changed in this draft? Please be specific.

Portfolios   
 
To help me assess both the quality of your work and your improvement, I would like to 
see all your work in a portfolio. 
 
You may re-revise Essays 2, 3 and/or 4. You must give a final polish to Essay 5,  
including either a page of Sources, listed alphabetically, or a “For Further Reading” page 
that divides sources into topics, and which lists sources alphabetically within categories. 
 
What, Why and How 
In a simple 2-pocket folder, please arrange your drafts and cover sheets as follows:    
• 
In the left-hand pocket, please put drafts of Essay 1-4, with most recent draft 
on top in each set.
 
In the right-hand pocket, put drafts of Essay 5 and Portfolio Cover Letter. 
If you did free-writing in class for Essay 5 and/or other essays, please include 
that, too.  
•  Do NOT print out clean drafts of essays—I want the ones that are marked up 
with my comments. 

• 
• 

 
Cover Letter  
The purpose of the Portfolio is to give you and me an opportunity to reflect on your work 
this term. To aid in this reflection, please address the following questions in a cover 
letter: 

•  What has changed in your writing and/or your approach to writing this term? 
Has anything changed in your reading practice?  
•  Which essay assignment stretched you the most? Explain. 
•  Which of your essays do you like best? Explain 
•  Anything else you want to comment on regarding your writing? (You will 
have an opportunity to comment on the course itself elsewhere.) 

 
When and Where 

Portfolios are due at our final class meeting, Thursday 5/14, or my office by 10:00 a.m. 
Friday 5/15. 
 
I will respond to your letters, and will leave Portfolios with letters to be picked up outside 
my office Monday May 18 after 2:00.
