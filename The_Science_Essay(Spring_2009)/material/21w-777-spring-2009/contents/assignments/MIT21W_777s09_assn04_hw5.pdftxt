ESSAY 2: HOME SCIENCE (750 WORDS) 
  
 
 
 
Science and technology are not just concepts we visit in labs and in books; they are all around us, 
shaping the world we live in and the way we see that world. Here is an opportunity to satisfy your 
curiosity about the science of something close at hand, something we encounter every day but to 
which most of us are blissfully oblivious. Write 750 words (2½-3 pages double-spaced, with 1-inch 
margins top and bottom and 1¼-inch margins left and right) on an aspect of “home” science or 
technology that you would enjoy sharing with readers. Though you will have to do some research, 
this is not meant to be written as a research essay. That is, you will not use formal citations. You will 
keep quotes to a minimum and mostly summarize or paraphrase your sources, just as if you were 
writing for a general interest magazine.  
 
Here are some possible topics:  
•  How my cell phone, DVR, watch, eyeglasses work(s). 
•  Chemistry of making bread, wine, cola, or grilling steak, or . . . 
•  Why my dog likes to play catch; why my canary sings. 
•  Materials engineering and/or physics of my tennis racquet, razor scooter, 
skateboard, or golf club. 

 
This essay must be accurate and clear—but that’s just the beginning. You aren’t writing a technical 
manual but, rather, an informal essay. Therefore you must fascinate your reader, keep her or him 
reading. Your tone may be earnest or amusing, but you must convince readers that your topic matters.  
Some suggestions: 
•  Begin by choosing a topic that genuinely interests you: if you aren’t interested, your 
reader won’t be, either!.  
•  Form a question or a series of questions about your topic to make your research 
efficient and to give your essay a shape. For example, “Why does barbecued meat 
taste so good? What makes it taste different than meat cooked on a stove?” or “What 
allows my watch to tell time accurately? What makes it waterproof?” 
•  Note that you aren’t writing a history of the science or technology involved—you are 
explaining how something works. 
•  As you write your essay, you will want to present your information in a way that 
makes it easy for the reader to follow. 
•  To make your subject easier to grasp and to interest readers, you will probably want 
to begin your essay with an anecdote or a problem from personal experience. You 
may continue to use personal experience in your essay if it helps you relate your 
ideas to readers. You may also find metaphors or analogies useful in explaining your 
topic. 

About sources: When you draw on sources for your essay, you must use your own 
language, not theirs. If you cannot summarize or paraphrase (i.e., significantly change the 
wording) then use quotation marks and name the source in your text. For example: As the 
Engineering Handbook says, tensile strength “is best defined as . . ..”. DO NOT, however, 
use lengthy quotations—they will spoil the tone and rhythm of your essay.  
 
For my information, please attach to your essay a list of your sources.
