21W.777 The Science Essay    
 
 
Homework #10 
 
READ David Denby’s essay “In Darwin’s Wake.” Denby is the film critic for the New 
Yorker. He often writes on cultural issues as well. 
 
Read attentively and actively; make marginal notes, ask (marginal) questions. Underline key 
and/or striking ideas and images. 
 
A few things to consider as and after you read: 
•  What is the structure of this essay? 
•  How does Denby function as a “character” in this essay? 
•  How does imagery carry and/or support ideas in this essay? Point to particular places. 
•  What does Denby seem to value, in Darwin and in other people (e.g., eco-tourists)? 
 
We will refer to all these things (and more!) in class.
