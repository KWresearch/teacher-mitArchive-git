21W.777 The Science Essay    
                    
Due for class Tuesday  4/14 
Homework #17      
 
 
 
 
Continue working on Essay 5.  For Tuesday: Refine your proposal and prepare a short 
Annotated Bibliography. 
 
1)  Refined proposal: Answer these three questions: 
•  What is your Inquiry Question? That is, what is the question that you would like to 
answer, and that you think will serve to shape your essay effectively. Note: You may 
include subsidiary questions here, but don’t just write a list of Q.s you want to 
answer—really aim to come up with ONE QUESTION that will drive your research 
and shape your paper. 
•  Why does it matter? What’s at stake for you and for readers? (You may want to paste 
some of your original proposal here, or you may have new thoughts.) 
•  At this early stage, whom do you envision as your “core reader”? 

 
2)  Write a short Annotated Bibliography, as follows: 
Make an annotated bibliography of your six best sources thus far. Your sources should 
include at least two books. List the source, thus: 
 

Book:  
Smith, Perry. A Short History of Consumer Culture. NY: Utopia Press, 2001. 
 
Article from an anthology, a journal,* a magazine or newspaper: 
Chang, Judy. “Selling and Demographics.” The New Consumerism Reader. Boston: 
Utopia Press, 2000. 150-179. 

 
Web 
See MLA format for web sources. Here are a couple of helpful links: 
 
http://www.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/workshop/citmla.htm. 
http://www.bedfordstmartins.com/online/cite5.html
(scroll down to “Box 5.3” and below—it gives you a pretty complete listing 
of types of web-based sources.) 

 
And then:: Describe each source in a sentence, followed by 1-2 sentences that tell why this 
source will be useful for your project. NOTE: This is the “annotation” part of the 
assignment. You will not get credit for the assignment without annotation. 
 
*A journal is a periodical publication containing short articles, written for an audience 
within a scholarly or professional discipline. Journal articles are peer-reviewed, which 
means that they have been vetted by scholars or professionals with competence in the 
field. They are distinct from magazines, which are written for a general audience—even 
though sometimes it may be a general audience with special interests. For example, the 
Journal of Neuroscience is a journal; Scientific American is a magazine. 
 
Due: If you get your 2 documents to me by 1:00 of 4/14, I will return them to you in class 
with comments. If you get them to me no later than 5:00 Tuesday, I will respond Tuesday 
evening via e-mail.
