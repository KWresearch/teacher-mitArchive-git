21W.777 The Science Essay - Spring 2009 
 
Homework #3 
 
ESSAY 1: READING RESPONSE  
Write 500 words (2 pages double-spaced) in response to one of our readings thus far. A 
single sentence, or the subject of one of the readings, or a couple of readings in relation to 
each other might prompt your musings.  
 
Your response can be exploratory, analytical, or persuasive; I encourage you to 
incorporate personal experience, memories, and/or work you’ve done or hope to do. In 
other words, let this essay take you where it will. Keep in mind, that, as a colleague of 
mine puts it, “I am not interested in the first thing your printer spits out”—even a short 
essay like this is a shaped piece of writing that takes the reader on a journey, however 
brief. 
 
Approach this essay as a warm-up that may suggest ideas for you to pursue later in the 
term. I will grade it, but the grade will count only slightly in your final grade. The 
primary purpose of the grade will be diagnostic. This essay will not be revised. 
 
NOTE: I am not looking for a literary analysis of one of our readings—rather, I’m looking for 
reflection on one or more ideas in our readings thus far. Note, too, that reflection doesn’t 
require certainty—good questions can be as valuable to readers as they are to writers.
