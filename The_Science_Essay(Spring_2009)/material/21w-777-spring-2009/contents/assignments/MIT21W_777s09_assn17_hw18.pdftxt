 Spring 2009 

 

Due for class Thursday  4/16 

1)  Outline: Figure out the 3 or 4 main chunks of information you will need to discuss in your 
essay. Come up with a heading for each section.  
 
Examples: Populations at risk, Playing the odds, How hot?, Getting to the source…  
 
In other words, don’t use headings like “Background,” or “Further problems”—these are 
generic and won’t  push your thinking very far. Instead, aim to really conceptualize the main 
pieces of your discussion and how they fit together. And as you work on your headings, 
think about your Inquiry Question: how does each chunk of the discussion lead to an answer 
to your question? 
 
So: Type up your headings in bold face, and under each heading in regular font either write a 
paragraph on “what goes here” or provide bullet points. 
 
If you are feeling particularly bold, or inspired, see if you can come up with a Title, too. 
 
 
2)  Introduction: You will probably want to start with a story or scene of some kind that 
dramatizes and encapsulates the issue you will be focusing on. Write that in 1 paragraph. 
Then write some sentences that provide the context in which you want readers to consider 
your Inquiry Question, and any background that readers will need up front to make sense of 
all this. Write about 2 paragraphs total. (Assume that the Introduction of your paper will 
ultimately take 2-3 paragraphs total.) 

 

Remember that an Introduction has to:  
•  Grab readers’ attention and make them want to keep reading  
•  Forecast what this essay will be about  
•  Provide a thesis and/or an Inquiry Question (in this case, I am requiring every paper 
to make use of a Question in the Introduction)  
•  Provide context for your inquiry  
•  Provide essential background (this is highly variable; it depends on your topic) 

 
We will spend about 45 minutes in class working with these. We will also begin individual 10-12-
minute conferences re: your Essay 5, esp. on making sure you have a clear focus and Inquiry 
Question. I’ll meet with ≈ 3 people during class time. I can meet with ≈ 3 people before class and 
the rest of you after class.
