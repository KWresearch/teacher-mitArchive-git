21W.777 The Science Essay      
 
 
Homework #15 
 
READ our final set of essays: 
•  Michael Pollan, “Our Decrepit Food Factories,” NY Times Magazine link: 
http://www.michaelpollan.com/article.php?id=91   and “Farmer in Chief,” NY 
Times Magazine link: http://www.michaelpollan.com/article.php?id=97
 
•  Elizabeth Kolbert, “Watermark.” The New Yorker 27 Feb. 2006: 
http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/02/27/060227fa_fact_kolbert
 
Michael Pollan’s two essays are on related topics, but each takes a different rhetorical 
approach—so think about that when you read them. Whom does he target, and how does 
he make his arguments convincing? Pollan is the author of The Omnivore’s Dilemma and 
In Defense of Food. 
 
Elizabeth Kolbert writes on politics and on global warming. Her article has to do with the 
tough choices involved in reclaiming delta land from inevitable flooding. Notice 
especially the kinds of evidence she presents, and the way she approaches the tough 
questions: does she make them clear? What does she want her readers to think or do? 
 
Note: Print these essays out and read them actively—I expect to see well-marked copies 
of the essays in front of each of you when we discuss them in class.
