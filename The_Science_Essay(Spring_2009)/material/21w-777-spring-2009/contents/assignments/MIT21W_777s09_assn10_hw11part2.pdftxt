21W.777 The Science Essay    
 
 
Homework #11 part 2 
 
READ these 4 book reviews and be prepared to discuss the ways the writers inform us 
about the bookâ€™s content and purpose, link it to current and historical contexts, and 
evaluate it. 
 
Please read each essay twice: First, skim them all. Then read more carefully, noticing 
things they do similarly, different approaches, surprising elements, etc.
