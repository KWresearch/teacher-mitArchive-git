We will workshop Essay 5 this way: You will read your partner's essay before class, so 
that you can respond meaningfully during the class workshop. PLEASE PRINT OUT 
YOUR PARTNER'S ESSAY BEFORE CLASS. When you read the essay before class, 
notice especially: Does the essay fulfill its promise? Does the evidence seem sufficient 
and appropriate? Are there good examples? Is the overall shape of the essay effective? 
How would you describe that shape? 
 
You don't need to answer these questions in writing before class, but you may begin 
making marginal notes/asking questions if you have time. 
 
In class we will work first in pairs--reading, commenting, discussing--and then everyone 
will pick one additional essay to comment on.
