21W.777 The Science Essay      
 
 
Homework #14 
 
BEGIN gathering ideas for Essay 5. Consult a couple of encyclpedias and websites like 
the NIH (National Institutes of Health) or WHO (World Health Organization): 
 
http://www.nih.gov/
 
http://www.who.int/en/
 
 
Also check out possibilities in databases through MIT Libraries’ VERA website: 
http://libraries.mit.edu/multi/research-guides.html
 
A great new feature of databases in VERA is that when you click on a topic link—say, 
mathematics—a “Subject specialist” librarian name and contact info appears in the upper 
right hand of the page. Let’s say you’re Chris, and you want to get to some historical 
background on a couple of math problems, and none of  the links on the database page 
seems likely to lead you there: Ask the librarian!
