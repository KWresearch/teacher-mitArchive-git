21W.777 The Science Essay      
 
 
Homework #16 
 
Write a Proposal for Essay 5. 
 
Essay 5 is a research-based essay on a topic of your choice, 10-12 pages double-spaced 
(2500-3000 words, not counting page listing sources). 
 
You may take any approach you like, but keep in mind that I will expect your essay to do 
more than present information; i.e., it should explore a topic—an idea—of some kind. It 
may or may not be persuasive. It may incorporate personal experience and/or interviews. 
But it must be thoroughly grounded in appropriate source material. 
 
For your proposal: 
1)  What topic are you interested in? (1-2 sentences.) 
2)  Why this topic? (1 paragraph.) 
3)  What do you hope to learn by researching this topic and writing this essay? (A 
few sentences.)
