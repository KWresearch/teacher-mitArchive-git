 21W.777 The Science Essay    
                    
Homework #13      
 
 
 
 
 
 
Essay 4: Book Review 1000–1250 words (4 - 5 pages double-spaced). 
 
Essay 4 is both a book review and an essay. This assignment should be enjoyable; it gives 
you a chance to enter into an extended discussion with a science writer whose work is 
esteemed by his or her peers and by the general reading public. It gives you a chance to 
mingle your words with those of an eminent writer, which is one of the pleasures of 
critiquing work that has literary merit.  
 
For the book review-essay, you need to: 
•  Describe the book, fairly: give your readers a good idea of what the book is about 
& what it’s like—its overall intention and structure.  
•  Give your readers the flavor of the book, using well-chosen quotes and telling 
details. 
•  Focus on a theme or develop an idea that unifies your discussion of the book—
this is where your review becomes an essay, and shows your particular sensibility. 
You don’t want to write 4 pages of: “ . . . and another thing about this book . . 
.”—you want your review to get your readers thinking about something. 
•  Evaluate the book against its stated intention and, possibly, in relation to similar 
books. 

 
Book reviews are challenging. For one thing, you must accurately represent the work 
you’ve chosen to review. Whether you agree or disagree with the writer’s views and 
approach, you must present them to readers in a form that the writer would recognize as 
his or her own. But you don’t want to spend the whole review summarizing the book; 
that’s a précis, not a review. Like the reviewers whose work we read, you want your 
chosen book to become a springboard for a discussion of one or more current issues in 
science or technology or in science writing,  or an issue that you think is due more 
attention. Another challenge will be quoting: you want to quote enough to give the reader 
the flavor of the book, yet you don’t want your review to be a string of quotes. 
 
You want to engage with both the content of the book—its validity, reasonableness, 
usefulness, originality—and also with the writing: is it highly abstract? Repetitious? Is 
the writing vivid? Are examples abundant and well chosen? Is the writer a master of 
metaphor? Does s/he rely heavily on analogies? What audience does the book seem to be 
addressing? Who should read this book? What are the particular pleasures of this writer’s 
style? Note: You don’t need to answer all these questions; they’re just prods for your 
thinking. You aren’t critiquing writing the way a writing teacher or editor would—you 
just want to give readers a feel for the language. 
 
Recall that most of the reviews we read actually spent relatively little time on judgment, 
and more time describing the book and discussing issues. This is a good way to go, 
unless you have a good reason for wanting to strongly praise or criticize your book. 
Remember also that judgment may be included in phrases throughout your essay—it 
needn’t be “saved up” for a section of its own. Readers do, however, expect some kind of 
summary evaluation, albeit brief.

Also: Remember to identify the book’s author in a phrase or two—“Pulitzer prize 
winning journalist,” “eminent physicist and lecturer,” etc. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Finally: Readers of  reviews want to know who’s writing them.  So please include at the 
end of your essay a 1-2 sentence author bio of yourself. 
 
Workshop Protocol: We will workshop in small groups on Tuesday—so bring 2 sets of 
your draft. We’ll workshop 2 essays as a whole class on Thursday. 

A note about sources: I prefer that you do not use any outside sources for this essay 
unless the book you are reviewing is more than, say, 20 years old—in which case, it 
might be useful to know how it was originally received. If you draw on additional 
sources for your essay, you must use your own language (paraphrase), not theirs, 
unless you quote precisely, and must identify anyone you quote or paraphrase. This 
kind of essay doesn’t call for citation, but please attach a list of any sources you use 
for my information.
