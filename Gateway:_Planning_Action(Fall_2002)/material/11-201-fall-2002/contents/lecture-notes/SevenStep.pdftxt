Planning Practice: 

An Overview 

•  Who are the planners? 
•  Why do they plan? 
•  How do they plan? 
•  How do we know if they have planned 
well? 
•  Are there (should there be) differences in 
the way planning is done in different places 
at different times? 

Who Are the Planners? 

•  Professional planners with job titles that say 
planning 
•  Professionals who plan but do not have job 
titles that say planning 
•  Non-professionals who plan (particularly 
grassroots activists) 
•  Non-professionals who shape what is 
planned (by stopping or changing what 
professionals have in mind) 

Why Do They Plan? 

•  To realize the goals and objectives of elected and 
appointed officials 
•  To respond to concerns expressed by individuals 
and groups 
•  To correct for market failures 
•  To take advantage of opportunities as they emerge 
•  To ensure greater efficiency in public investment 
(particularly through coordination and leverage) 
•  To ensure greater fairness 

How Do We Know If They Have 
Planned Well? 
•  The stakeholders (All? Some? A Majority?) are 
satisfied 
•  The process was efficient (saved time and money 
given the tasks and the options) 
•  The outcome was efficient and sustainable (No 
Waste? Pareto Optimal? Gains to the Gainers 
Outweigh Losses to the Losers?) 
•  Relationships enhanced (Easier to Deal with Each 
Other in the Future?) 
•  Confidence in government/institutions enhanced 

Should There Be Differences in 
the Way Planning is Done? 
Planning should be culturally sensitive and 
responsive to the unique demands of each time 
and place (What Does That Mean?) 
Professional planning should be governed by 
universal norms of “best practice” (How should 
these be defined?) 
Planning practice should be governed by broad 
general principles of fairness, efficiency, 
accountability, and technical “excellence,” but 
these must be defined anew in each situation 
(How?)
