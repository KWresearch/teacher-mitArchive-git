COMPREHENSIVE 
NEIGHBORHOOD PLANNING: 
TAKING ACTION IN BOSTON'S 
SOUTH END 

Introduction: Three Issues for 
Discussion 

•  Planning Traditions-as background to 
master planning 
•  The Boston Master Plans 
•  Urban Renewal Planning in the South 
End and the Planning Dilemmas 

PLANNING TRADITIONS 

the use of technical 

•  The Design Tradition: [Aesthetics] the use and organization of 
built space 
•  The Rational Tradition: [Efficiency] 
knowledge, “facts” 
•  The Reform Tradition: [Equity] 
social, political and 
institutional accountability for the poor, marginalized and 
excluded 
•  The Power Tradition: [Effectiveness]  getting things done, 
implementation, political clout 
•  The Environmental Tradition: the emerging awareness of and 
environment as an integral part of the 
concern for the natural 
planning process (NEW KID ON THE BLOCK ) 

THE BOSTON MASTER PLANS – A COMPARISON: 
A. Vision 

l950 Plan 
• 
"A proper city plan as a powerful influence upon the 
mental and moral development of the 
people.It is the 
firm basis for the building of a healthy and happy 
community” 
•  Logue Plan 
tension between Utopian and Pragmatic: only 
limitations are "willingness of the people themselves 
to carry it out and the everyday requirements for 
getting things done” 

THE BOSTON MASTER PLANS – A COMPARISON: 
B. Concept of Blight 

•  1950 Plan 
“land uses have to be rationalized to wipe out those extremes of blight
that levy severe social and economic costs upon the balance of the
city” 
by analysis of 
one can know 
“Scientific facts” (taking into account
condition and age, and rent of residential buildings) 

•  Logue Plan 
issue of blight avoided by creating 2 categories: 
• 
structural : "held in check" because of variegated neighborhood
pattern, relative lack of overcrowding, basic structural soundness of
most of the city's buildings 
environmental: “real issue”: incompatible land use, changing
economic character of neighborhoods, lack of basic public services in
those neighborhoods 

THE BOSTON MASTER PLANS – A COMPARISON: 
C. Time Horizon 

•  1950 Plan 
"...a realistic plan looks only to the predictable future, a 
possibly 
relatively short time in this dynamic age, 
twenty-five years.” 

•  Logue Plan 
Ten years 

THE BOSTON MASTER PLANS – A COMPARISON: 
D. Degree of Detail and connection to specific 
programs 

•  1950 Plan 
“I understand that only the essential or key planning elements are
dealt with in this report leaving refinements to be studied and
detailed progressively as the work continues” 
•  Logue Plan 
Emphasis on tying it to federal dollars and specific programs. 
“The Plan attempts to give explicit direction to the ideals that 
underlie the development program” 
  action oriented 
  use of federal dollars all over public action for private change 
  orchestrate public investment–capital web 
  focus on land use NOT residential demolition 
  focus on healing neighborhoods and connecting them 

THE BOSTON MASTER PLANS – A COMPARISON: 
E. Meaning of comprehensiveness / Equity issues 

•  1950 Plan 
Not mentioned 
•  Logue Plan 
Central element on paper: 
“From its inception the Development Program has assumed that 
the elimination of physical blight can only be accomplished if it is 
accompanied by the elimination of its social counterparts: 
poverty, racial injustice, insufficient schooling and 
unemployment” 
Both Comprehensive Plans are concerned to see Boston in a 
regional context 
Both know that decisions there are outside the control of the 
city 

DILEMMAS IN PLANNING PRACTICE 

•  Government regulation vs. reliance on 
markets 
vs. effectiveness 
•  Equity vs efficiency 
•  Comprehensive vs. incremental 
•  Bottom up vs. top down 
•  Utopian vs. Pragmatic 
•  Public Interest vs. Pluralism 

DILEMMAS IN PLANNING PRACTICE: 
Government regulation vs. reliance on markets 

•  not regulation as much as creating a 
market 
•  federal government expected to 
leverage energize the private sector 
•  The Feds” as partner and patron 

DILEMMAS IN PLANNING PRACTICE: 
vs. effectiveness 
Equity vs efficiency 

•  have to see it triangulated with efficacy-
i.e. getting things done 
•  importance of time and timetable 

DILEMMAS IN PLANNING PRACTICE: 
Comprehensive vs. incremental 

•  what is the meaning of comprehensive? 
i.e. how much social planning? 
how much wait for social planning? 
how tie social planning to physical? 
how deal with skid row in the South End? 

•  part of the planning process: 
Who plans for it and how? 

DILEMMAS IN PLANNING PRACTICE: 
Bottom up vs. top down 

•  Logue the master builder BUT slogan of 
“planning with people” -- issue becomes 
“which people”? 
•  Dependent on approval in the neighborhoods 
•  Middle range-i.e. many neighborhoods 
aggregated: 
what SCALE constitutes the bottom and top? 

DILEMMAS IN PLANNING PRACTICE: 
Utopian vs. pragmatic 

•  can be utopian both in terms of what plan for and 
how plan i.e. inclusionary idea 
•  South End should not be a shiny new place but not a 
museum either 
•  Tightly bound into renewal funding and presumption 
of federal dollars 
•  so what is "utopian in planning”? getting approval at 
the renewal 

DILEMMAS IN PLANNING PRACTICE: 
Public interest vs. pluralism 

•  public vs. private 
regarding the "vocabulary of the times" what constitutes 
the public interest -- giving up your house? 
•  problem of spatial distribution vs. "interest“ 
Lodging house owners vs. block association -- i.e. 
importance of "Place/space" 
•  people don't sort out by "place" 
•  What is the public interest in the South End? 

OTHER PRACTICE DILEMMAS: 
Role of the planner 

•  normative view of what decision rules are 
•  what the local system allows-i.e. the politics of 
neighborhood-who has power? 
•  caught between demands of the neighborhood and 
demands of city hall (may not be the same) 
•  "will of the people" vs/ what will fly in renewal 
process/city hall etc. how much to intervene? 

OTHER PRACTICE DILEMMAS: 
Scale 

•  master plans talks about city and region as well as 
neighborhood 
what are issues that rise above "neighborhood level" ? 
•  what is the “neighborhood”-given 16 neighborhood 
associations in the South End 
•  Groups don’t sort out by spatial location. What is the 
meaning of “scale” when don’t have a physical place 
as base?
