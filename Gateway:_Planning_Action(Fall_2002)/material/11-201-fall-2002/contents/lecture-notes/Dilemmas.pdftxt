Key Dilemmas in Planning 
Practice 
•  Government Regulation v Reliance on
Markets 
•  Equity v. Efficiency 
•  Comprehensiveness v. Incrementalism 
•  Bottom up v. Top down 
•  Utopian v. Pragmatic 
•  Public interest v. Pluralism 
•  Economic Development v. Environmental
Protection 

Government Regulation v. 
Reliance on Markets 
•  When to rely on markets and market
mechanisms? 
•  When and how to respond to market
failure? 
•  Command-and-control v. other models 
of government regulation 
•  Using and shaping market mechanisms
for public purposes 

Equity v. Efficiency 

•  What principles of equity or fairness 
ought to apply in public planning? 
•  When might “more equality” be an 
inappropriate goal for public planning? 
•  Under what circumstances might 
efficiency trump equity as a goal? 
•  How should efficiency be measured? 

Comprehensiveness v. Incremental 

•  What does it mean to take a 
comprehensive or systemic approach to a
problem? 
•  Under what circumstances is 
comprehensiveness a useful ideal for
planners? 
•  Under what circumstances is incremental 
a problematic objective? 
•  How should the tension between 
comprehensiveness and incremental be
managed? 

Bottom Up v. Top Down 

•  Under what circumstances would a bottom-up
approach to planning be inappropriate? 
•  Under what circumstances might a top down
approach to planning be necessary? 
•  Can a bottom up approach to planning work
at a regional or national scale? 
•  Can a bottom up approach work if there is
insufficient grassroots capacity? 
•  Does a top down approach to planning
increase the reliance on expertise? 

Public Interest v. Pluralism 

•  Is there such a thing as the public interest?
How should it be defined in any specific
situation? 
•  Is the public interest something more than the
sum of individual or group interests? 
•  Under what circumstances will a 
confrontation among interest groups produce
the public interest? 
•  Do we expect planners to be “engaged
advocates” or “objective technicians”? Should
they seek to represent specific interests or
the public interest? 

Economic Development v. 
Environmental Protection 
•  Are economic development and
environmental protection always 
at odds? 
•  Under what circumstances might they be
mutually reinforcing as planning objectives? 
•  Does sustainability offer a means of
reconciling these objectives? 
•  How should progress toward economic
development and environmental protection be
measured? 

Other Dilemmas 

•  Globalization v. community preservation 
•  Physical determinism v. social welfare 
•  Expertise v. indigenous knowledge 
• Others?
