Here are some questions to help you in thinking about the 4 group projects
in preparation for in-class discussion on lecture #18. 

1.  	 All four presentations assumed that planners and planning departments had 
an important role to play in making decisions about the future of Heijplaat, 
although each emphasized a slightly different set of activities and 
responsibilities for planners. What is the range of roles that planners can 
legitimately play at the local level? Who decides what the planners role 
should be in each situation? 

2.  	 How would you measure the success of the planning activities prescribed in 
each of the four presentations? More specifically, what indicators could we 
use to "benchmark" progress or success? 

3.  	 All four presentations assumed that planning involves multi-staged 
interventions dependent on constant feedback. What are the ways in which 
feedback should be gathered and assessed at each step in the planning 
process? Who collects this feedback? Who determines what it "says" about 
past and future steps in the planning process? 

4.  	 To what extent do you think that internet-based information dissemination and 
public dialogue can substitute for face-to-face versions of the same activities? 
Why? Do you think this will change over the next few years? 

5.  	 All four groups basically finessed the question of what to do when outreach 
efforts produce contradictory responses from different segments of the 
community. Should the intensity of a group's reply to outreach questions 
affect the way the results are reported? Should the number or respondents 
expressing a certain view determine what the planners propose? If numbers 
and intensity don't matter, then why bother engaging in an outreach process? 

6.  	 Will a community be able to generate a realistic vision to guide future growth 
and development if professional planners and designers don't give them 
specific options to review? Can a neighborhood really translate its "concerns" 
into detailed depictions of alternative development schemes? 

7.  	 All four groups wanted to promote sustainable community development. 
What's the right time frame for thinking about whether a development strategy 
is sustainable? Should environmental sustainability be given more weight 
than social or economic sustainability? After all, if the "health" of the land and 
people can not be assured, does anything else matter?
