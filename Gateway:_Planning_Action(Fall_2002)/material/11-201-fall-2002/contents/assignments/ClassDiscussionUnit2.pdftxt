Prepare these questions for discussion in class for lecture #5. 

1.  	 What are the decision rules in Logue's definition of a "good planning 
process?" To what extent do they accord with yours? 

2.  	 In what sense is urban renewal planning in the South End a "zero sum 
game?" i.e. there are winners and losers depending on whose voice gets 
heard? Given the goals of the urban renewal process as defined by Logue 
how might the outcome be “value added," or "non-zero sum."? 

3.  	 The South End planning process is made up of a bewildering array of 
"stakeholders." How do you see them arrayed in terms of "who has the 
power.” If you were concerned with "equalizing power" of the stakeholders at 
the urban renewal table how would you do so in a way that would result in a 
timely "yes" vote at the public hearing on the plan? 

4.  	 If you had been hired by the lodging house owners to help represent their 
interests in the planning process how might your analysis of problems and 
opportunities differ, if at all, from those facing Green and his team? What if 
you had been hired by the liquor establishments along Dover Street to 
represent their interests? What would your strategy be? Who would be your 
allies? 

5.  	 What about the "scale issue." Are there concerns involved in comprehensive 
renewal planning for the South End that impact the city as a whole? The 
Downtown interests? Conversely are there issues at the level of the individual 
South End neighborhood associations that impact and "conflict" with the 
overall planning process for THE South End? How do you handle this 
"planning for different levels" issue in terms of your "planning process?
