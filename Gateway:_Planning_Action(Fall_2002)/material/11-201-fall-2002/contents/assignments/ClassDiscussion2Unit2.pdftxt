Questions for discussion on Group Projects â€“ for lecture #8. 

1.  	 All the groups proposed rather elaborate public involvement processes. 
Do you think that elected public officials might be put off by such 
proposals? Aren't the elected officials the ones who are supposed to 
speak for the community? Doesn't the kind of "come-if-you-please" public 
participation process proposed by the four groups negate our commitment 
to representative democracy? 

2.  	 All the groups seemed to operate on the assumption that neighborhood 
priorities should trump city-wide needs and priorities. How can that be the 
right way for cities to plan? Where in the process are residents asked to 
help set city-wide priorities rather than local priorities? How can stitching 
together a set of neighborhood plans yield a coherent vision of the city as 
a whole? 

3.  	 All the groups seemed to assume that general policies and goal 
statements can be translated into specific spatial designs and resource 
allocations. But, aren't the goals and priorities that come out of the public 
involvement process likely to be too general to translate into one and only 
one set of designs or resource commitments? And, if that's right, doesn't it 
mean that the professional planners and designers are really the ones 
making all the key decisions? 

4.  	 No one talked about capacity building or public education as a collateral or 
parallel process to public involvement. Can we really assume that 
community folks have the background and skills they need to formulate 
and articulate their views and needs? What kind of public education effort 
might be helpful in this case? What kind of media strategy would be 
appropriate? 

5.  	 There was not much focus on interagency or intergovernmental 
collaboration. There are other city agencies besides the BRA with federal 
funds and regulatory authority. They could either be supportive or get in 
the way. Why wasn't there more focus on involving them (and maybe 
regional and state agencies and officials) in the urban redevelopment 
process? 

6.  	 Is it really reasonable to assume that "a good process will produce a good 
outcome," or do planners have to be ready to propose their own plans or 
solutions in case the process (of public involvement) doesn't work? 

7.  	 Several groups imagined a role for an "advocate planner" within the city 
run public involvement process. Can you imagine being that person --paid 
by the city to work on behalf of neighborhood interests and sometimes 

against the city's interests? Is that really a feasible and sustainable 
situation?
