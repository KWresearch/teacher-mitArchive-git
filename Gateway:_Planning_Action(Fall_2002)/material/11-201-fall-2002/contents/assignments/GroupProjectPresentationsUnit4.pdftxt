Below are the guidelines for the group projects to be presented
in lecture #17. 

You should take the role of a team of consulting planners that have taken the job 
of organizing an intervention at Heijplatt. Your intervention must respond to the 
proximal conflict about noise and safety generated by the proximity and 
interaction between port activity (principally loading and unloading container 
ships and trucking to and from the terminal) and the residential areas of Heijplatt. 
The broader goal however, is to initiate a process of sustainable development 
that can produce the ideas, actions and relationships that are necessary to 
engage such an elusive goal. 

Your process design should respond to the following issues: 

How will you adjust to the fact that many shared assumptions and commitments 
(including ones about the goals and rules of the game) are likely to be 
problematized in the interaction? Tensions between ethnic groups and other 
groups could erupt at any moment to challenge the subject of the conversation 
and the grounds (including procedural grounds) on which you are proceeding. 
How will you secure and sustain your position and legitimacy in this turbulent 
environment? 

Second, how will you engage the broader environmental, economic, and social 
issues from your starting point of a conflict about safety and nuisance? 

Finally, what strategy will you have for initiating a process of development and 
learning that can produce tangible ideas, commitments and that give shape to 
and further a practical vision of a sustainable Heijplatt and Rotterdam and set the 
conditions for subsequent (hopefully ongoing) transformations of this vision?
