Prepare these questions for discussion in lecture #12 

1.  	 We heard about many different sources of power that planners (even 
without formal authority) may be able to exercise. Which sources of power 
do you think are typically underutilized and why? What might you be able 
to do while you are at MIT to enhance your ability to tap these multiple 
sources of power more effectively in the future? 

2.  	 Group IV talked about spending time in "the epicenters of social capital." 
Do you think it is always possible to locate these epicenters? How would 
you identify them? Do you think that planners will always be welcome in 
these locales? What might you do to increase the likelihood that you, as a 
planner, would be able to tap into the well-springs of social capital? 

3.  	 Group III is banking on NAFTA connections to restore confidence in the 
planning process. What is your reaction to this idea? Would it be possible 
to take advantage of NAFTA's credibility without turning over control of the 
process to them? 

4.  	 Group I assumed that the order in which strategic alliances are made is 
important. Do you agree? Do you agree that the order implied by their 
"four scenes" was the right order? What kind of commitments would you 
have sought at each step of the way? Written agreements? 

5.  	 Group IV used a variety of quantitative arguments (especially with regard 
to transportation capacity) to make its point about the need to question the 
basic assumptions behind the national government's support of the new 
airport. What kinds of quantitative arguments carry weight in political 
discourse and why? 

6.  	 All four groups advocate a much broader and more encompassing public 
involvement process in any future airport planning. None of the groups, 
however, even hinted at how such massive public consultations ought to 
be organized. Can you say anything at all about the scope, style, or 
method of public consultations on such a scale? Can you point to a 
relevant precedent -- particularly in a developing country?
