Alternatives

No dialogue until 
dialogue was forced; 
distrust of government 
given track record.

Insufficient 
resettlement options

Inclusion in a process          
that addresses power                
imbalance.

Cernea’s
-
comprehensive 
resettlement 
model (IRR)

Texcoco is the best location for the 
airport

Critique

Layoff of 2200 airport 
employees, impact on 
local industries and 20,000+ 
other jobs, cost of new 
development.

Alternatives
Districto Federal
Create incentives for 
commercial & residential 
investment at Benito Juarez 
to compensate for loss of 
jobs and tax base.
Environmental Groups

Loss of migratory bird habitat, 
aquifer contamination, loss of 
catchment/flood prevention 
mechanism.

Mitigation of impacts; 
balance environmental 
gains from Texcoco lake 
project with environmental 
losses from airport assuming 
they can coexist.

Alternatives

Reasons for 
choice of location:

-Political
-Economic
-Technical????

Further study of 
alternate options:
- expand Benito Juarez
- Hidalgo
- Network w/ Guadalajara 
& Monterrey
- Network w/ Puebla, 
Toluca, Cuernavaca

An Airport is Essential to Global Integration

Critique

Alternatives

Questionable reasoning:
- Air traffic forecasts 
optimistic
- Assumed level of 
economic growth derived 
from new airport
- Hub creation intent not 
backed by airline 
commitments

Further study of:
– economic  impact of 
new airport
– more sustainable 
development (expand 
local industries, organic 
farming etc.)

National Development
Critique

Alternatives

Global 
integration might 
raise country’s 
GDP, but not 
everyone wins. 
Rich getting 
richer, poor 
getting poorer in 
most cases.

- promote domestic 
industries
- protect food 
security
- raise income 
levels of the poorest 
in addition to 
globalization efforts.
