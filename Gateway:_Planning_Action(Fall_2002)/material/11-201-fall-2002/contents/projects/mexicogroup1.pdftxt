Mexico City Airport Planning

… in four Scenes

Scene One

Analyzing Texcoco
Conversation between the 
D.F. Planning Director and D.F. Mayor

Failure of Airport Planning Process

Process failed because:
• Closed-door political 
decisions 
• Excluded stakeholders
• Limited frame of 
reference
• Invalid decision rules

D.F. Planner

Planning Structure Needed to 
Guarantee D.F. Involvement

• Events of the last year created a unique 
opportunity for a more equal distribution of power
• Regional planning council would ensure adequate 
involvement of all stakeholders

D.F. Planner

Political Strategy

• To get political buy-in from State and Federal 
government for this new planning structure, D.F. 
needs to establish strategic alliances with 
opposition groups, especially the campesinos
• Furthers your political ambitions
• Expands PRD’s political base

D.F. Planner

Scene Two

The Alliance
Meeting with D.F. Mayor, 
D.F. Planning Director and 
Ignacio Del Valle (Leader of 
San Salvador Atenco campesinos)

Concerns

• No reason to trust new promises, need 
concrete actions on part of D.F.
• Historically non-responsive to indigenous 
• Left outside power structure

Ignacio del valle

Reasons for alliance

• We need continued 
support
• Interests connected from 
desire to stop growth
• D.F. government helpful 
in stopping airport

Ignacio del Valle

What we want

• Guarantee to protect land rights 
• Representation on airport decision making body 
• Veto power over site
• Indigenous rights bill support
• Measure of autonomy over local decision 
making

Ignacio del Valle

Building an Alliance

• Can’t provide all these things
• Can provide
– Seat at the table on airport planning process
– Place on decision making bodies about social impacts 
of airport siting
– PRD support for passage of Indigenous Rights Bill

D.F. Mayor

Scene Three

Vision for Airport Planning 
D.F. Mayor calls a meeting with
President Fox
Governor of State of Mexico
Ignacio del Valle
and D.F. Planners 

Airport Planning 
Process Failed

• Stakeholders were excluded in the decision making 
process 
• People have expectation of democratic rule; it is our 
responsibility as politicians to fulfill this 
• Political process has been discredited; government 
needs to redeem ourselves

D.F. Mayor

Where We Are Now

• Solution still needed to airport problem; 
Benito Juarez lacks capacity to meet air travel 
needs 
• Problem -solving process needs reworking
• Possibilities need to be explored, e.g., new 
airport, expanding current airport, sites in 
other cities, etc.  

D.F. Mayor

Moving Forward

• Forum for all stakeholders to be heard
• Expand scope of planning participants
• More transparency in decision-making
• Increased coordination of interests
• Balance national, regional and local interests
• Balance government and popular interests

D.F. Mayor

Mandate of MZMC Regional 
Airport Planning Commission

• List all alternative sites for the airport
• To examine all alternatives in light of five concerns:
– Economic interests and impacts
– Technical requirements for airport
– Social costs
– Environmental impacts
– Infrastructure connecting airport to city
• To elaborate a new regional airport plan

D.F. Planner

Approval of Regional 
Airport Plan

• Constant communication between citizens, 
representatives, politicians, and planners.
• Citizens in neighborhoods provide both source and 
ultimate approval of plan
• Final approval by DF Mayor, Governors, and President
• If this process is successful, the structure could be 
institutionalized as a Regional Planning Body.

D.F. Planner

Scene Four

Agreeing to the Plan 
Conversation between the
President of Mexico and 
Governor of State of Mexico

Initial Doubts 

• Limits Federal power in decision making
• No guarantee that national interests are met
– Global competitiveness
– Economic growth
– Employment
Improved infrastructure
–

President Fox

Dilemma

• With the airport problem left unresolved, it 
is difficult to achieve the nation’s goals
• Cannot revamp airport planning process 
because the project’s credibility has been 
jeopardized

President Fox

How the MZMC RAPC 
can  Help

• Restore credibility to the airport project: 
through citizen participation, transparency, and 
coordination
• Re-legitimize the Federal government 
• Confirm commitment to democratic principles
• Establish support of all stakeholders

President Fox

State Government Agrees

• Process can help
– Restore PRI reputation
– Guarantee PRI participation in the decision -
making process
– Address the interests of my constituents (new 
infrastructure, attract new industries, raise 
property values)

Governor of State of Mexico

Additional Benefits

• Establishes common priorities for the region
– Employment
– Quality public services
– Infrastructure and transportation
– Environment
• Reconciles tensions regarding how to 
achieve these priorities (means to the ends)

Governor of State of Mexico

Tensions Between Groups

• Will the solution to the airport problem
– Promote economic development? For whom?
– Provide an efficient allocation of resources?
– Be sustainable?
• These tensions need to be reconciled for agreement 
to be reached – the process can help do this
