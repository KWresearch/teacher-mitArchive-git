7.014 Problem Set 5 
Answers to this problem set are to be turned in . Problem sets will not be accepted late. 
Solutions will be posted on the web. 
Question 1 
Organisms can use a variety of carbon and energy sources, depending on their availability in the 
environment.  Oxidation and reduction reactions play critical roles in metabolism, and the relative 
favorability of these reactions often dictates the type of metabolism an organism will employ in a 
given situation.  For example, organisms that conduct aerobic respiration (like humans) use organic 
carbon compounds (like glucose) as both their carbon source and their energy source.   
a)  What compound is reduced by the transfer of electrons from glucose? What are the oxidized and 
reduced forms of this compound? 

Electrons are then passed down the electron transport chain, sequentially reducing proteins in the 
chain, in the process creating a proton gradient for ATP synthesis. 

b)  What is the final electron acceptor for organisms performing aerobic respiration? Why do 
organisms need a final electron acceptor? 

The reduction of oxygen is a very favorable reaction; in fact oxygen is the most favorable electron 
acceptor.  Organisms conducting respiration in the absence of oxygen do so anaerobically, using 
other compounds as electron acceptors. 

c)  Consider the following environments where different compounds are present. Circle the 
compound in each environment most likely to be used as an electron acceptor. Top portion of the 
table from the Redox handout has been reproduced on page 6 (last page) to help you decide.

Environment 3

Just as electron acceptors are selected in evolution based on thermodynamic favorability, so are 
electron donors.  Whereas respiration uses organic compounds as electron donors, and 
photosynthesis uses water as an electron donor (to replace the electron excited by light), many 
organisms use inorganic compounds as electron donors and sources of energy. 
d)  For each electron donor below, give the compound it will be converted to upon oxidation.  Circle 
the compound that will yield the most energy upon oxidation. 

H2S  Æ
 NH3 Æ
-NO2  Æ
 Fe2+  Æ
 CH4  Æ 

Question 1, continued 
e)  Organisms using the above compounds as electron donors are employing what type of 
metabolism?  Are these organisms most likely prokaryotes, archea, or eukaryotes (pick all that 
apply)? 

Question 2 
Curious about the Sorcerer II expedition of Craig Venter, you take your own research vessel to the 
Sargasso Sea to study the phytoplankton community there.  At a particular location in the open 
ocean, you measure several environmental parameters (nutrient and light levels) down the water 
column as well as the relative abundances of two ecotypes (i.e. strains), I and II, of Prochlorococcus, a 
unicellular cyanobacterium. 
Inexplicably, as you are returning to Woods Hole to analyze your data, your ship is raided by 
pirates, who steal your data on the abundance of the two ecotypes.  Fortunately, the pirates did not 
take your data on nutrient and light levels.  You remember that you have genome sequences for the 
two strains, providing you with information on which genes each ecotype has.  Based on this 
genomic information (in the questions, below) and the depth profile data, answer the following 
questions.

measured the abundance of two Prochlorococcus strains.

dashed black line: nitrate (NO3  ) 
-
solid gray line: phosphate (PO43-) 

The genome of ecotype II appears to have nitrate reductase, 
allowing it to utilize nitrate as a nitrogen source.  Ecotype I does not 
appear to have nitrate reductase. 

Figure by MIT OCW.
a)  Based on this observation and the nitrogen data above, which ecotype should dominate which 
part of the water column (shallow/0-100 m or deep/100-200 m) and why? 

b)  Name two important molecules in the cell that require nitrogen for biosynthesis.  In which 
redox form does the cell require its nitrogen, oxidized or reduced?

Question 2, continued 
c)  Without using the graph, would you expect one or both of these ecotypes to have genes for 
phosphate transport proteins in their genomes?  If yes, which one(s) and why? Why don’t you 
need to use the graph? 

Prochlorococcus possesses two types of chlorophyll, a and b.  Chlorophyll a (Chl a) absorbs longer 
wavelengths (red) better than chlorophyll b (Chl b), whereas Chl b absorbs shorter wavelengths 
(blue) better than Chl a.  Blue wavelengths penetrate deeper down the water column because 
they are scattered and absorbed less by water than red wavelengths.  The operons for Chl a and 
Chl b biosynthesis are expressed at different levels in these two ecotypes, such that ecotype II has 
a higher Chl b/a ratio than ecotype I (ecotype I has a comparatively low Chl b/a ratio). 

d)  Which ecotype would you expect to dominate shallow (0-100 m) water and which would you 
expect to dominate deep (100-200 m) water?  Why? 

In general, photosynthetic organisms, such as phytoplankton, grow faster under higher light 
intensity. However, as we just observed, one of these ecotypes has evolved to prefer a lower light 
intensity. 

e)  Why has this ecotype evolved for optimal growth at low light intensity? 

Question 3 
Walking down the infinite corridor one day, you and your friend are suddenly engulfed in a space-
time distortion and transported to a barren world covered with fake-looking rocks and sparse 
vegetation, strikingly similar to a set from the original Star Trek.  After an indeterminate period of 
blind panic, you and she realize you may be stuck there for a long time, and begin to assess the 
situation.  You find that there are only three non-microbial organisms on the planet: raspberry 
bushes, ants, and anteaters.  Having just finished 7.014, you both realize that your introduction into 
this ecosystem is bound to disrupt it and, to maximize your survival, you should be careful of what 
you eat.  Your friend starts to study the situation, and she draws the following energy flow diagram 
to represent the ecosystem (next page): 

a) You look at your friend’s diagram 
i) What do the arrows B, F, and J represent? 

ii) Why do both plants and animals “lose” energy by the process in part (i) above?

iii) Assuming that the thickness of all lines is proportional to the amount of energy transferred 
by that route, what mistake has she made in drawing the diagram? 

b) Write expressions for the following, using the variables (A, B, etc.) on the diagram. 
i) Net Primary Productivity (NPP). 

ii) Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP), include A in your formula. 

c) Her diagram contains more than is immediately visible in your environment (i.e. raspberries, ants, 
and anteaters) 
i) What is “detritus” 

ii) What is represented by box “Z”? 

d) Your friend starts to apply her knowledge from 7.014 to decide which you should eat to get the 
most out of the available food supply: raspberries, ants (yuck) or anteaters (tastes like chicken!). 
i) As a human eating these three things, from which food source will you get the highest 
exploitation efficiency and why? 

ii) As a human eating these three things, from which food source will you get the highest 
assimilation efficiency and why?

Question 3, continued 
iii) Which of these things will have the highest production efficiency (an intrinsic property of 
the organism)? 

 e) You realize that your friend has been wasting her time, because you know the answer without 
worrying about the analysis.  What should you eat to get the highest ecological efficiency out of 
the system and why? 

Question 4 
A fictional plant Greenever grows all year around, even in New England, and blooms in January. A 
patch of these plants is the only thing that brightened the view from your dorm window this winter.  
In talking to your friend about your favorite plant, you realize that your friend also has a Greenever 
plant patch outside of his window, but his did not bloom this winter.  You consult Google, and 
verify that the blooming variety is indeed the wild type. 

Intrigued, you cross the plants outside your window with those outside your friend’s window. All 
resulting plants bloom next January. 

a)  You reason that the trait is caused by a single gene, Bloom, that you abbreviate to Bl. What is the 
mode of inheritantce of Bl? Why? 

b)  You cross first generation plants. What results do you expect to see? Why? 


In addition to Bl gene, you manage to identify two other genes in Greenever, A and D. 

A schematic of a diploid nucleus of the Greenever is drawn below.  It contains three pairs of chromosomes 

(2n = 6).  As drawn, it is about to begin the process of meiosis but has not yet replicated its DNA.

Question 4, continued 

The cell that contains this nucleus 

•  has the genotype AaBlblDd where 

• 

• 

the A and Bl alleles are linked (as are the a and bl alleles) and 

the D gene is on a different chromosome. 

Redraw the schematic of this nucleus when it is at metaphase prior to the first meiotic division.  Do 
not include any crossovers. In your drawing, position the A, a, Bl, bl, D, and d alleles consistent with 
the information given above.
