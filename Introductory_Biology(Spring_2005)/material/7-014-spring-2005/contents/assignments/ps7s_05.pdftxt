d) Cindy wants to store cell samples from her chinchilla so that in the future she can produce a clone. 
She has  isolated  cell  lines  from  the  following  four different  cell  types.   However,  freezer  space  in  the 
lab is limited and she can keep only one.  Which cell line should she keep? 

Red blood cell 

Gut cell 

B cell 

T cell 

Why keep this cell line rather than the others? 
She should keep the gut cell line.  Red blood cells do not have nuclei, and B and T cells have rearranged the 
DNA at the antibody and T cell receptor loci, respectively

Question 1, continued 
Part B 
The virus which causes AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is called HIV (human 
immunodeficiency virus).  HIV is a retrovirus, and its genome is a single RNA strand.  Two copies of 
this RNA genome are packaged with two copies of the retroviral enzyme, reverse transcriptase, 
within a protein capsid. 

a) For HIV infection to occur, a surface protein on the virus must interact with a surface protein on 
the cell. HIV specifically infects the helper T cells of the human immune system.  Give one reason that 
HIV infection is specific for helper T cells. 
A viral protein on the surface of the HIV particle binds to a protein that is only found on helper T cells. 
b) Once infection has taken place, the RNA genome has to be made into double-stranded DNA.  This 
process is mediated by reverse transcriptase.  Once a double-stranded DNA copy of the HIV genome 
has been made, it is integrated into the host cell genome.  The integration event is mediated by an 
enzyme, integrase. 
      i) What are the three steps required to produce double-stranded DNA from the single strand RNA 
genome? 
1.  Synthesis of the complementary strand of DNA using the single strand RNA genome as the template. 
2.  Degradation of the single (+) strand RNA template. 
3.  Synthesis of the complementary strand of DNA using the single strand of DNA as the template to form 
double-stranded DNA. 

Protein
RNA 
DNA 
Which one of the enzymatic 
ii) The central dogma states that: 
     activities possessed by reverse transcriptase goes against the central dogma?  Explain your answer. 
     The RNA-directed DNA polymerase activity used to synthesize a single strand of DNA from a single strand     
RNA template.  The central dogma states that only DNA can act as the template for DNA synthesis (in 
replication), and that only DNA acts as the template for RNA synthesis (in transcription). 
The drug most widely used to combat AIDS is Azidothymidine (AZT).  AZT is very similar to 
thymidine, except that the 3' hydroxyl (OH) group on the deoxyribose ring has been replaced by an 
azido (N3) group. 
c) Which process of the life cycle of the HIV do you think is inhibited by AZT? 
As an analog of thymidine, AZT interferse with the synthesis of DNA. HIV reverse transcriptase incorporates 
AZT instead of thymidine into the growing DNA and it blocks further chain elongation because there is no  3' 
OH group. 
d) What side effects, if any, do you expect from AZT treatment? 
While AZT will inhibit DNA synthesis mediated by reverse transcriptase, it will also inhibit DNA synthesis in 
other cells and thus kill cells that are actively dividing (e.g. red blood cell precursors, skin cells, etc.  However, 
HIV reverse transcriptase prefers to use AZT over thymidine while host cell DNA polymerase prefers 
thymidine over AZT.  Therefore, AZT may be used at concentrations that inhibit HIV replication but are not 
yet toxic to host cell polymerases. 
e) AZT-resistant forms of HIV have been isolated.  These mutant viruses have mutations in one of the 
viral genes.  In which viral gene do you think are the mutations most likely to be found?  Why? 
The mutations are most likely to be in the viral gene coding for reverse transcriptase (the pol gene) because 
mutations in this gene may directly cause the mutated reverse transcriptase not to prefer AZT during 
replication and thus become resistant to AZT.

b)  When the table was made, some of the values were measured and others were calculated from 
those values.  Which three values in the table must be measured in order to construct the rest of 
the table? 
x, nx, bx 

The  gray  squirrels  have  a  high  infant  mortality  rate  (mx),  but  those  that  survive  tend  to  not  die  of 
natural  causes  until  age  five  to  seven.    In  the  meanwhile,  those  that  die  do  so  because  of  a  natural 
predator of the gray squirrel, the Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV). 

c)	 Given  the  table  above,  what  is  the  replacement  rate  (Ro)  of  the  population?  Is  this  population 
increasing, decreasing or staying the same? 
Ro = 1.41.  Because Ro is greater than one, the population is increasing. 

d)  A migration of SUVs into the area has increased the mortality rate (mx) of all squirrels between the 
ages of one and four years by 0.2. 
i)  Calculate  the  number  of  animals  (nx)  and  the  proportion  of  the  original  cohort  surviving  to 
each  age  (lx)  for  the  years  one  through  five  given  this  new  mortality  rate.  For  any  fractional 
values of nx, round to the nearest whole number. 
n1-5 = 150, 90, 54, 32, 19 

1-5 = 0.3, 0.18, 0.108, 0.064, 0.038 

l

ii)  What  is  the  new  replacement  rate  for  the  population?    Is  this  population  increasing, 
decreasing or staying the same? 
Ro= 0.892.  Therefore, the population is now decreasing.

Question 2, continued 
e)  Given the original conditions, what is the generation time (G) of the gray squirrels? (Hint: G = (Σlx 
bx x) / Ro) 
G = (Σlx bx x) / Ro

 Therefore G = 4 years 

f)  What is the intrinsic rate of increase (r) of the gray squirrels? (Hint: r = lnRo / G) 
r = lnRo / G  Therefore  r = 0.086 per year 

g)  In the space below, draw a graph showing the growth of the cohort and its offspring as a function 
of time.  Recall that Nt = No ert.  Let your time axis go from 0 to 25 years.

h)  How many gray squirrels are present after 25 years?  Is this realistic?  If so, explain why.  If not, 
explain what we have not taken into account. 
There   are   about   4,300   squirrels   present   after   25   years.   This   is   not   realistic   because   we  have   not   taken  
into   account   any   density   dependent   restrictions   on   the   squirrels’   growth   such  as   limited   space   or  
resources.  

i)	

If the carrying capacity (K) equals 2,000, make a very rough sketch of the growth of the cohort and 
its offspring on the graph that you have made above.  Be sure to indicate which curve belongs to 
part g and which belongs to part i.  Assume instantaneous feedback.

Question 2, continued 

Survivorship curves reveal information about survival strategies of species.  They are plots of the 
survival over time of individuals in a cohort (group of individuals in same population, born in same 
time period). 
j)  Draw three different types of survivorship curves (label your axes). 
100% 

Type I 

50% 

0% 

Type II 

Type III 

Age of Individuals in Cohort 

k) Use your drawing above to indicate which type of survivorship curve best applies to the cohorts 
given below. 
i) Cohort of 20 sugar maple seedlings growing in the shadow of the parent, a tall  sugar maple 
in mature forest. 
Type III curve best applies, since the parent has generated many offspring but will invest no extra 
energy in caring for these offspring.  In fact, in this case the parent is successfully out competing its 
offspring for the limited resource, light.  When the tall sugar maple eventually dies, one or two of its 
offspring may grow tall to fill the gap created in the canopy.  The other seedlings will remain small and 
will presumably die at a young age. 

ii) Cohort of 100 babies born at Mass General Hospital. 
Type I curve best applies, since human infant mortality is relatively low (when high quality health care 
is accessible) and since humans invest a tremendous amount of energy in caring for their offspring. 

iii) Cohort of 1000 zooplankton in a lake containing a stable fish population which preys on 
zooplankton. 
Type II curve best applies.  Parental zooplankton don't invest energy in caring for their offspring.  In 
this case, survivorship will mainly be determined by the rate at which the fish preys on the zooplankton.  
Presumably zooplankton don't acquire skill at avoiding predation as they age, so each zooplankton 
should be at an equal risk of predation throughout its life. 

iv) Cohort of 100 corn plants planted and cultivated on a farm. 
Type I. Plants will be protected from disease and predation and will live until they are harvested.

a) Which amino acid(s) are invariant throughout this evolutionary tree?  Why might have these 
amino acids been conserved in an actual organism? 
The conserved sequence is  K - - - - - - KS - -  (cid:173)
If these amino acids were important for maintaining the structure or the function of the protein in which they 
are found, they might be conserved in evolution. 

b) Complementation across species. 
i)  Would you expect this protein from organism 1 to complement a deficiency in organism 
11? Why or why not? 
It is unclear from the data, but it is not very likely. The entire XYZ protein is only 12 amino acids long, 
and the difference between XYZ proteins from species 1 and 11 is 5 amino acids. Moreover, most of 
these substitutions are not conservative. However, if all that matters for function are the three conserved 
residues, complementation might still take place. 
ii) 	 Would you expect one of the glycolysis enzymes from organism 1 to complement a  
deficiency in organism 11? Why or why not? 
Because glycolysis enzymes are highly conserved in evolution due to their essential nature, we would 
expect glycolysis enzymes from organism 1 to complement a corresponding deficiency in organism 11.  

c) Suppose you were able to get the DNA sequences of this protein from the twelve species. Would you 
expect the tree constructed using the DNA sequences to be more or less accurate than the tree constructed 
using the protein sequences? Why or why not? 
We would expect the DNA tree to be more accurate than the protein tree because we would be able to follow the 
evolution of the actual gene sequence, and not just the protein sequence that results from it. Following gene 
sequences would allow us to track silent mutations, as well as missense mutations, and would result in a more 
accurate tree.
