7.014 Problem Set 2 
Answers to this problem set are to be turned in. Problem sets will not be accepted late. 
Solutions will be posted on the web. 

Question 1 
Open the Human γD crystallin (HγD-Crys) structure html file by clicking on the link on the 
Problem Sets page.  Rotate the molecule and get an idea of the three dimensional structure of 
(HγD-Crys).  HγD-Crys is a soluble human eye lens protein. 

I.  The true 3-dimensional structure of HγD-Crys can be observed using the “Show Spacefill” 
button, and a trace of the peptide backbone can be observed using the “Show Ribbon” button. 

a)  If possible/applicable, describe the following types of structural features of HγD-Crys: 
i. 	 Secondary: 
The secondary structure is described as α-helical or β-sheet.  Secondary structure is 
controlled by backbone hydrogen bonds between amino acids.  HγD-Crys is primarily β-
sheet, but has two small α-helices; one at the top of each domain. 

ii.	 Quaternary (Hint: Use the “Color Ribbon by Protein Subunit” button): 
The quaternary structure of a protein created by a number of distinct interacting amino acid 
chains.  If we color HγD-Crys by chain we find there is only one amino acid chain and, 
therefore, no quaternary structure.  There are two β-sheet domains in the protein, but they are 
both from one amino acid chain. 
b)  Does there appear to be a gap between the two protein domains in the ribbon and spacefill 
structure representations? 
Ribbon: Yes 

Spacefill: No 

c)  Which of the two representations (spacefill or ribbon) more accurately represents the actual 
structure of HγD-Crys in the cell?  Why? 
The spacefill model is a more accurate representation of what HγD-Crys looks like in the cell.  The 
spacefill representation shows the van der Waal radius or electron density clouds of all non-hydrogen 
atoms in the protein.  The ribbon structure simply shows a trace of the polypeptide backbone without 
showing any amino acid side chain atoms. 
II. We will now look at some interactions important in maintaining the tertiary structure of HγD-
Crys. 

d)  Choose “Central Interaction” 

i. 	 What are the names of the amino acids involved in this interaction? (Hint: It may help to 
change the representation of the residues to ball and stick by clicking in the box labeled 
“Ball and Stick on/off” below the 3D window.  Keep in mind that in cpk coloring, gray 
is carbon, blue is nitrogen, and red is oxygen.  Hydrogen is not shown!) 
The interaction involves a methionine, a  phenylalanine, two valines, an isoleucine, and a leucine. 

Question 1, continued 

ii.	 The central cluster is composed of what type of amino acids (acidic, basic, hydrophobic, 
or polar)? 
All of the residues are hydrophobic amino acids. 

iii.	 What type(s) of interaction(s) are formed between residues in this cluster? 
     All of the amino acids form a hydrophobic cluster and, therefore, are involved in hydrophobic interactions. 

iv.  Select “Central Interaction with All Atoms Shown.” This view shows all the atoms of 
HγD-Crys (not including hydrogens) as transparent dots.  Is the central interaction located 
on the inside or the outside of the protein?  Why is this reasonable given that HγD-Crys is a 
soluble protein? 
These amino acids are primarily found on the interior of HγD-Crys. There are a few areas that are solvent 
exposed, but most of the cluster is shielded from solvent.  It is energetically favorable for this cluster to be 
buried from a hydrophilic solvent like the cytoplasm or water because it the amino acid side chains are 
hydrophobic and like nonpolar environments . 

e)	 Choose “Interaction I” 

i. 	 What are the names of the amino acids involved in this inter-domain interaction? 

There is an arginine and a glutamine residue in this interaction. 

ii.	 What types of amino acids are involved in this interaction (acidic, basic, hydrophobic, or 
polar)? 

Glutamine is a polar residue, while arginine is basic. 

iii.	 What type(s) of bonding interaction(s) are found between these two residues? 

These residues interact via a hydrogen bond. 

iv. 	 Based on the 3-D structure of amino acid pairs, what parts of the amino acid are 

involved in forming this interaction (circle the correct answer)? 


Only the amino acid side chains 	

Only the amino acid backbones 

Both the amino acid side chains and backbones

Question 1, continued 

v.	 What one amino acid substitution could make this interaction stronger?  What one 
amino acid substitution could make this interaction weaker?  Justify your answer in each 
case. 
Substituting glutamic acid for glutamine would make the interaction stronger.  Glutamine and glutamic 
acid have very similar size and shape, and glutamic acid and arginine would then make an ionic bond, 
that is stronger than the hydrogen bond that the glutamine and arginine make. 
Substituting phenylalanine for arginine would make the interaction weaker. Phenylalanine is a large 
nonpolar amino acid that would only be able to interact with glutamine by van der Waals bonds, a bond 
that is weaker than the hydrogen bond that the glutamine and arginine make. Although phenylalanine 
and arginine are both large amino acids, their shapes are not too similar. However, since the interaction 
in question is happening on the outside of the protein, the shape differences will likely not play a 
significant role. 

III. HγD crystallin protein is known to be involved in cataract formation in the eye.  Cataracts form 
when several proteins in the eye bond to one another to create a very large insoluble multi-protein 
complex. 

There is a point mutation that changes the arginine normally found at position 14 to a cysteine.  
Children with this mutation develop cataracts.  The overall 3-D structure of the protein remains 
the same despite this substitution. 

Both in the wild type and this mutant version of the HγD crystallin protein there is also a cysteine 
at position 110.  Click on the button labeled “Residues 14 and 110” to see the location of these two 
amino acids. 

f) Are the amino acids at positions 14 and 110 found in the inside or on the outside of the HγD-
Crys structure? 
They are found on the outside, solvent-exposed surface of the protein. 

g) Consider two molecules of mutant HγD crystallin protein. Recall that these molecules would 
have cysteine residues in both positions 14 and 110.  What type of interaction could form between 
these two molecules? 

A disulfide bond could form between two nearby mutated crystallin molecules. 

h) How could interaction in part g above lead to the development of a cataract? 

The cysteine at position 14 in crystallin molecule A could bond to the cysteine at position 110 of crystallin 
molecule B.  The cysteine at position 14 in crystallin molecule B then could bond to the cysteine at position 
110 of crystallin molecule C.  This could continue on and on until a very large multi-protein complex 
formed.  Disulfide bonds are covalent bonds and are, therefore, very strong.  Covalent bonding between 
many adjacent crystallin proteins would eventually produce a huge protein complex composed of many 
different crystallin chains that would become insoluble and fall out of solution simply because of its 
enormous size.

Spontaneous 

Phosphofructokinase (PFK) is the primary site for regulation of the glycolytic pathway.  The 
activity of PFK is dependent on the energy status of the cell. 

d)  Why would a cell regulate glycolysis? 

The end result of glycolysis is the generation of ATP.  If ATP levels in the cell are high, then the cell would 
not need to spend resources to generate more ATP.  However, if the levels of ATP are low, then the cell 
would utilize the glycolytic pathway to generate the needed energy. 

e)  What is the specific signal or molecule(s) to which PFK responds? 

PFK responds to the decreased ATP to ADP ratio (increased levels of ADP. 

f)  Why does this mechanism of regulation make sense? 

Normally, a low ATP to ADP ratio indicates that cells need more energy currency available ready to use. By 
speeding up glycolysis, more ATP can be formed from ADP to raise the ATP to ADP ratio. 

g)  In certain tumor cells, an enzyme called ATPase becomes abnormally active, resulting in 
increased hydrolysis of ATP to ADP. What would be the effect on the overall rate of glycolysis 
in these cells? 

The activity of the glycolytic enzymes would increase, increasing the overall rate of glycolysis.

a)  On the diagram, circle the two steps that require ATP.  How did you determine that ATP was 
required for these steps? 
The circled steps lead to the products that have an extra phosphate with respect to the reactant (glucose or 
the product of the previous step of the pathway) 

b)  There are steps where the product has a higher free energy than the reactants and yet these 
steps do not require ATP.  What drives these reactions? 
The steps that do not require ATP are driven by the relative concentrations of reactants (higher) with respect 
to that of the product (low). The way the cell keeps the concentration of products low is by immediately using 
the products as reactants in the next step of the pathway. 

c)  On the diagram, box the energy harvesting steps. 

d)  The harvested energy is stored in what molecule(s)? 
NADH and ATP 

e)  What is/are the molecule(s) listed in (d) used for? 
ATP is used to drive reactions in the cell, and NADH is used to regenerate NAD+ for the next rounds of 
glycolysis.

Question 4 

Rubisco is a key enzyme in the dark phase of photosynthesis, and is the most abundant protein on 
Earth. It makes up roughly 50% of the protein content of chloroplasts.  Rubisco catalyzes the 
addition of one molecule of CO2 to a five carbon sugar ribulose 1,5-biphosphate.  The resulting six-
carbon sugar is unstable, and splits into two molecules of 3-phosphoglyceric acid.  

a)  You happen to have some 14CO2 around your lab, so you decide to place your favorite fichus 
into a large hermetically sealed container, and pump some 14CO2 into the container to mix with 
regular atmosphere already in there. After some time, you move the fichus to a non-radioactive 
environment. A quick read with a Geiger counter reveals that the plant is now slightly 
radioactive. 

i.	

If you moved the plant after 1 minute, and analyzed the cells immediately, where 
would you expect to find radioactivity? Circle all that apply: 

Evenly distributed throughout the cell 
Mostly in the chloroplasts
 
 
Mostly in the nucleus 
Mostly in the mitochondria 

 

 

carbohydrates 
nucleic acids 
proteins 
lipids 

ii.	

If you moved the plant after 1 minute and analyzed the cells the next day, would your 
answer change? Why or why not? 
After 1 minute, we would expect most of 14C to be either in the form of 3-phosphoglyceric acid, 
ribulose 1,5-biphosphate (that is regenerated from 3-phosphoglyceric acid), or in another 
carbohydrate in the glucose-generating pathway. If the plant is removed and the leaves are taken for 
analysis after 1 minute, but are not actually analyzed until the next day, we would expect some 
metabolic processes to happen in the leaves in the intervening time, such that some 14C would end up 
in other molecules in the cells. 

iii.	

If you moved the plant the next day, where would you expect to find radioactivity in a 
fichus leaf cell? Circle all that apply: 

Evenly distributed throughout the cell 	
Mostly in the chloroplasts  	
Mostly in the nucleus 	
Mostly in the mitochondria  	

carbohydrates 
nucleic acids 
proteins 
lipids 

Justify your answer(s) 

CO2 that is fixed from the atmosphere is used to make glucose that is then used in many intersecting 
pathways in the cell.  Glycolysis is used to make ATP, while other pathways lead to making of 
nucleotides, amino acids, and fats.  In short, all mass was (at some point) gas.

Question 4, continued 

iv.	 You dream that your pet goat eats your experimental plant.  In such a scenario, where 
would you now find 14CO2? 
The goat would use 14C acquired from the plant in all aspects of its metabolism. Some of it would exit 
in excrement, some would be used to build new molecules in goat’s cells, and some would be respired 
out in the form of 14CO2. 

Rubisco is a very inefficient enzyme—it only processes about three CO2 molecules per second. 
Inside a plant chloroplast it forms large complexes with eight active sites in each.  The complex 
does not appear to be allosterically regulated—each subunit appears to be very rigid, and each 
active site operates independently from all other active sites in the complex. Recall that 
chloroplasts are small organelles. 

b)  Propose a hypothesis for why Rubisco forms large complexes, and an experiment to test this 
hypothesis.  Assume that you can create cells with any kind of mutant Rubisco protein you 
would like. 
One hypothesis would be that because the room inside the chloroplasts is limited, Rubisco forms tight 
complexes such that the most active sites can be exposed in the least amount of space. 
One way to test this hypothesis is by creating cells where the only Rubisco protein is the mutant that can not 
form these large complexes. The model behind our hypothesis would then predict that in such cells, a lot less 
CO2 would get fixed, resulting in a lot less energy and raw materials available for the cell. It is reasonable to 
expect that an organism consisting of this type of cells would have stunted growth.  
Therefore, if the mutant plant exhibits shunted growth, the result would be consistent with our hypothesis. If 
not, our hypothesis would be proven wrong, and we would have to start again.
