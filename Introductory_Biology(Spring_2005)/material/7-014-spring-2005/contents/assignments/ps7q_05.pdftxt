mature B cells? 

d) Cindy wants  to  store  cell  samples  from  her  chinchilla  so  that  in  the  future  she  can  produce  a 
clone.  She  has  isolated  cell  lines  from  the  following  four  different  cell  types.  However,  freezer 
space in the lab is limited and she can keep only one.  Which cell line should she keep? 
Red blood cell 
Gut cell 
B cell 
T cell 

Why keep this cell line rather than the others?

Question  1,  continued 
Part B 
The virus which causes AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is called HIV (human
immunodeficiency virus).  HIV is a retrovirus, and its genome is a single RNA strand .  Two copies
of this RNA genome are packaged with two copies of the retroviral enzyme, reverse transcriptase, 
within a protein capsid. 
a) For HIV infection to occur, a surface protein on the virus must interact with a surface protein on 
the cell. HIV specifically infects the helper T cells of the human immune system.  Give one 
explanation for how HIV infection is specific for helper T cells. 

b) Once infection has taken place, the RNA genome has to be made into double-stranded DNA. 
This process is mediated by reverse transcriptase.  Once a double-stranded DNA copy of the HIV 
genome has been made, it is integrated into the host cell genome.  The integration event is 
mediated by an enzyme,  integrase. 
i) What are the three steps required to produce double-stranded DNA from the single strand 
RNA  genome? 

ii) Given that these three steps are all performed by reverse transcriptase, what are three 
enzymatic activities that reverse transcriptase must possess? 

DNA 
RNA 
Protein
iii) The central dogma states that: 
Which one of the enzymatic 
activities possessed by reverse transcriptase goes against the central dogma?  Explain your 
answer. 

The drug most widely used to combat AIDS is Azidothymidine (AZT).  AZT is very similar to
thymidine, except that the 3' hydroxyl (OH) group on the deoxyribose ring has been replaced by an 
azido (N3) group. 
c) Which process of the life cycle of the HIV do you think is inhibited by AZT? 

d) What side effects, if any, do you expect from AZT treatment? 

e) AZT-resistant forms of HIV have been isolated.  These mutant viruses have mutations in one of 
the viral genes.  In which viral gene do you think are the mutations most likely to be found?  Why?

b)  When the table was made, some of the values were measured and others were calculated from 
those values.  Which three values in the table must be measured in order to construct the rest of 
the  table? 

The gray  squirrels  have  a  high  infant mortality  rate  (mx),  but  those  that  survive  tend  to  not  die  o f  
natural causes  until  age  five  to  seven.  In  the  meanwhile,  those  that  die  do  so  because  of  a  natural 
predator of the gray squirrel, the Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV). 
c)	 Given  the  table  above, what  is  the  replacement  rate  (Ro)  of  the  population?  Is  this  population 
increasing, decreasing or staying the same? 

d)  A migration of SUVs into the  area  has  increased  the  mortality  rate  (mx)  of  all  squirrels  between 
the ages of one and four years by 0.2. 
i)	 Calculate the number of  animals  (nx)  and  the  proportion  of  the  original  cohort  surviving 
to  each  age  (lx)  for  the  years  one  through  five  given  this  new  mortality  rate.  For  any 
fractional values of nx, round to the nearest whole number. 

ii)  What is the new replacement rate for the population?  Is this population increasing,
decreasing or staying the same?

Question  2,  continued 
e)	 Given the original conditions, what is the generation time (G) of the gray squirrels? (Hint: G = (Σ 
lx  bx  x) / Ro ) 

f)	 What is the intrinsic rate of increase (r) of the gray squirrels? (Hint: r = lnRo  / G) 

g)  In the space below, draw a graph showing the growth of the cohort and its offspring as a 
function of time.  Recall that Nt  = No  ert.  Let your time axis go from 0 to 25 years. 

h)  How many gray squirrels are present after 25 years?  Is this realistic?  If so, explain why.  If not, 
explain what we have not taken into account. 

i)	

If the carrying capacity (K) equals 2,000, make a very rough sketch of the growth of the cohort 
and its offspring on the graph that you have made above.  Be sure to indicate which curve 
belongs to part g and which belongs to part i.  Assume instantaneous feedback.

Question  2,  continued 

Survivorship curves reveal information about survival strategies of species.  They are plots of the 
survival over time of individuals in a cohort (group of individuals in same population, born in same
time period). 
j)  Draw three different types of survivorship curves (label your axes). 

k) Use your drawing above to indicate which type of survivorship curve best applies to the cohorts 
given below. 
i) Cohort of 20 sugar maple seedlings growing in the shadow of the parent, a tall sugar 
maple in mature forest. 

ii) Cohort of 100 babies born at Mass General Hospital. 

iii) Cohort of 1000 zooplankton in a lake containing a stable fish population which
preys on zooplankton. 

iv) Cohort of 100 corn plants planted and cultivated on a farm.

Question  3 
The Hollywood producers are getting wistful for good old times. A leading production company 
decides to film a script entitled “Squatting Aardvark, Spitting Llama”. 
Naturally, a production of this magnitude needs to be filmed on location – in this case the peaceful
meadows and grasslands of the high Andes in central Peru. Since the director of the film knows
nothing about the llamas to be used in the film, she hires you as a naturalist to accompany the film 
crew. 
While studying the llamas in the Andes, you notice that they can be divided into three classes based
on their spitting ability: Type A spits 1 m, type B spits 2.5 m, and (the most vicious of them all) type
C spits 4 m. After doing some genetic tests, you determine that the spitting distance is determined 
by a single locus, which you name D (for distance). 
The three types of llamas can be summarized as follows: 

Type 

Genotype 

A 
B 
C 

dd 
Dd 
DD 

Phenotype
(spitting distance)
1 m 
2.5 m 
4 m 

You survey the local llama population and find that out of the 400 llamas, there are 64 type C 
llamas. 
a) If the llama population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, then 
i) What is the frequency of the d allele? 

ii) What is the frequency of the D allele? 

iii) How many of each type of llama do you expect to find out of the 400? 
Type A: 
Type B: 
Type C:  

64

 ----
-
400 total


In reality, you find that the population distributes as follows:
Type A: 112
Type B:  224 
Type C:  64 
b) Which genotype is over-represented when compared to the predicted Hardy-Weinberg 
distribution?  Explain the discrepancy between the actual numbers and your predicted values. 

7


c) There are a number of ways in which the distribution of alleles in a population can differ from the
ideal Hardy-Weinberg distribution.  Match each of the following scenarios with the name that 
describes this effect. Then list one (of the 5 given in lecture) assumption of the Hardy-Weinberg 
model that is violated in this scenario. 
A. On rare occasions, parents, both of which are homozygous recessive (dd), have an offspring 
born that is heterozygous (Dd). 
B. An Argentinean production company, also filming a movie in Peru about llamas, imports its own
population of llamas into the Andes. 
C. Deciding that they’re going to be making a sequel, the studio decides to bring 25 llamas back 
with them to California. When you look at this population a few generations later, you notice that it 
is in equilibrium, but with different phenotype distributions than the original Peruvian population. 
D. For the film, you import the squatting aardvarks from near Lake Victoria. Unexpectedly, the 
squatting aardvark turns out to be a rather keen llama hunter. [This reeks havoc upon the filming
schedule]. The squatting aardvark detects the llamas by the sound of their spitting. Llamas that spit
farther make more noise when  they spit.

d) A typical rate of mutation is 1 mutation in a particular gene per 106  sperm or egg cells. The effect 
of mutation on genotype distributions is very small. Why, then, are mutations considered to be so 
important  for evolution? 

e) Let's apply these concepts to a human population.  Cystic Fibrosis is a recessive genetic disease of 
the lungs determined by a single genetic locus.  About 1 in every 2500 human children is born with 
cystic fibrosis. 
i) Of the approximately 100 students in 7.014, how many do you expect to be carriers of the 
Cystic Fibrosis mutation? 

ii) Cystic Fibrosis is a lethal disease and affected individuals usually die prior to starting  a 
family.  Given this selective pressure, why does this disease still persist in the population?

a) Which amino acid(s) are invariant throughout this evolutionary tree?  Why might have these 
amino acids been conserved in an actual organism? 

b) Complementation across species. 
i)  Would you expect this protein from organism 1 to complement a deficiency in organism 
11? Why or why not? 

ii) 	 Would you expect one of the glycolysis enzymes from organism 1 to complement a 
deficiency in organism 11? Why or why not? 

c) Suppose you were able to get the DNA sequences of this protein from the twelve species. Would you 
expect the tree constructed using the DNA sequences to be more or less accurate than the tree 
constructed using the protein sequences? Why or why not?
