A n sw er s  to  th i s  p r ob l em  set ar e to be tu r ned  in. Problem sets will not be accepted late.  
Solutions will be posted on the web. 

Please read the following two articles and use them to answer Question 1. 

Article I 

Please refer to article:
Fouad, Tamer. "Laptops can affect fertility in males, US researchers warn."
(January 1, 2005).

Question  1 
a)  Do the articles above present the findings of the laptop study objectively?  If yes, justify. If no, 
give examples of biased reporting and explain why you believe the reporting to be biased. (Feel 
free to underline or highlight passages in the text, as long as you clearly identify the meaning of 
your markings) 

b)  Look again at the second article.  Does the Laptop Desk study answer the question of how 
likely is it that this device would help alleviate the problem of the elevated scrotum temperature 
associated with laptop use? Why or why not? 

c)  Based on the information in the two articles, do you think the Laptop Desk is likely to be a 
significant relief for the problem of the elevated scrotum temperature associated with laptop use? 
Why  or why not? 

d)  Based on the information in the two articles, do you think it was appropriate to include the
information about the Laptop Desk in the second article? Why or why not?

Question  2 
Hemoglobin is the protein complex that carries oxygen around our bodies and distributes it to the 
organs and tissues.  Sickle cell anemia is a disease that results from the presence of abnormal 
hemoglobin (HbS) in the red blood cells. In order to have the disease a person needs to have only 
HbS hemoglobin. 
Wild-type hemoglobin (HbA) is composed of 2 α and 2 β polypeptides. The α and  β  polypeptides
are approximately the same length, and are very similar in their primary structure. 
a) �If you run HbA on a denaturing gel, how many bands are you likely to see? Why? 

When mutant HbS and wild-type HbA hemoglobin molecules are analyzed on a denaturing gel, 
they produce identical patterns. 
b) �What is the likely defect in the HbS? Why? 

At low concentrations of O2  HbS forms rigid rod-like complexes in the cell. These complexes
deform the red blood cells from saucer shape to sickle-like shape. These rigid, sickle-like cells can
get stuck in the small blood vessels and cause damage. 
The β-subunit of HbS has the amino acid valine in position 6, where the wild-type molecule has a
glutamic acid. 
•� At normal oxygen concentrations, the overall shape of the β-subunit and the entire�
hemoglobin molecule remains unaffected by the substitution.�
•� At low concentrations of O2 , the Val6 on one β-subunit interacts with two amino acids on a 
β-subunit of another hemoglobin molecule. 

c) What level(s) of protein structure of the β-subunit is (are) affected by the substitution at normal 
oxygen  concentrations? Why? 

d) What level(s) of protein structure of the β-subunit is (are) affected by the substitution at low 
oxygen  concentrations? Why? 

At low concentrations of O2  the Val6 on the mutant β-subunit interacts with a surface pocket made 
up of amino acids Phe85 and Leu88.  This pocket is found on both wildtype and mutant β-subunits. 
e) What is the strongest interaction involved in this binding event?

Question  2,  continued 

f) This pocket is found on both wild-type and mutant β-subunits.  Explain why (at low
concentrations of O2 ) hemogloblin containing only mutant β-subunits forms long rods yet 
hemogloblin containing wild-type β-subunits does not. 

g) The hemoglobin of a person who has both HbA and HbS does not form long rods and thus 
does not exhibit sickle-cell symptoms. Explain in terms of molecular interactions why the red
blood cells of such a person are not deformed. 

Question 3 
In order for a substance to boil, the kinetic energy of the molecules must exceed the energy of the 
forces between the molecules.  For each pair of compounds listed below, explain the difference in 
the boiling in terms of the intermolecular forces.

Question  4 
In the past thirteen months, NASA has successfully landed spacecraft on the planet Mars and on
Titan, one of the moons of Saturn.  One of the goals of each mission was to look for evidence of 
water.  Different evidence of the past or present existence of water was found on both Mars and 
Titan.  Neither Mars nor Titan has oxygen-containing atmosphere. 
a)  Scientists are not concerned with the absence of oxygen in the atmosphere, but instead view 
water as a sign of the possible existence of microbial life.  Given what we know about the history 
of life on Earth, why is water regarded as a much more important sign of possible life than 
oxygen?  

The evidence found on the surface of Mars is consistent with a number of scenarios.  One is that 
the surface of the planet once contained oceans, rivers, and lakes.  However, currently the 
atmosphere on Mars is too thin to allow these bodies of water to remain on the surface. 
b)  Assume that these bodies of water once contained living organisms.  Provide two alternative 
hypotheses for how a planet might move from having a thick atmosphere over the surface with 
bodies of water containing living organisms to having a thin atmosphere over the dry surface with 
no detectable living organisms. 

NASA scientists describe Titan as an extraordinary world where Earth-like geophysical processes
operate on exotic materials in very alien conditions. Instead of liquid water, there is liquid methane
(temperature on Titan is sub -170°C); instead of silicate rocks, there is frozen water ice; instead of 
dirt, there are hydrocarbon particles; and instead of lava, Titan’s volcanoes spew very cold ice. 
c)  We have no idea what life on Titan might look like.  However, if we are to find a living 
organism on Titan, it will have the following three properties: 

d)  Assume that life is found on Titan and that these organisms live in an environment where 
energy is freely available from abiotic sources.  If in the future, the energy from abiotic sources 
becomes limiting, what feature would be common in the organisms that would survive and thrive 
during such a transition? Why?
