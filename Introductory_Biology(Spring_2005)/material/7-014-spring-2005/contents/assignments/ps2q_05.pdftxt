7.014 Problem Set 2 
Answers to this problem set are to be turned in.  Problem sets will not be accepted late.

Solutions will be posted on the web. 


Question 1 
Open the Human γD crystallin (HγD-Crys) structure html file by clicking on the link on the 

Problem Sets page.  Rotate the molecule and get an idea of the three dimensional structure of 

(HγD-Crys).  HγD-Crys is a soluble human eye lens protein. 


I.  The true 3-dimensional structure of HγD-Crys can be observed using the “Show Spacefill” 
button, and a trace of the peptide backbone can be observed using the “Show Ribbon” button. 

a)  If possible/applicable, describe the following types of structural features of HγD-Crys: 

i. 	 Secondary: 

ii.	 Quaternary (Hint: Use the “Color Ribbon by Protein Subunit” button): 

b)  Does there appear to be a gap between the two protein domains in the ribbon and spacefill 
structure representations? 

Ribbon: 

Spacefill: 

c)  Which of the two representations (spacefill or ribbon) more accurately represents the actual 
structure of HγD-Crys in the cell?  Why? 

II. We will now look at some interactions important in maintaining the tertiary structure of HγD-
Crys. 

d)  Choose “Central Interaction” 

i. 	 What are the names of the amino acids involved in this interaction? (Hint: It may help to 
change the representation of the residues to ball and stick by clicking in the box labeled 
“Ball and Stick on/off” below the 3D window.  Keep in mind that in cpk coloring, gray 
is carbon, blue is nitrogen, and red is oxygen.  Hydrogen is not shown!) 

	
Question 1, continued 

ii.	 The central cluster is composed of what type of amino acids (acidic, basic, hydrophobic, 
or polar)? 

iii.	 What type(s) of interaction(s) are formed between residues in this cluster? 

iv.  Select “Central Interaction with All Atoms Shown.” This view shows all the atoms of 
HγD-Crys (not including hydrogens) as transparent dots.  Is the central interaction located 
on the inside or the outside of the protein?  Why is this reasonable given that HγD-Crys is a 
soluble protein? 

e)	 Choose “Interaction I” 

i. 	 What are the names of the amino acids involved in this inter-domain interaction? 

ii.	 What types of amino acids are involved in this interaction (acidic, basic, hydrophobic, or 
polar)? 

iii.	 What type(s) of bonding interaction(s) are found between these two residues? 

iv. 	 Based on the 3-D structure of amino acid pairs, what parts of the amino acid are 

involved in forming this interaction (circle the correct answer)? 


Only the amino acid side chains 	

Only the amino acid backbones 

Both the amino acid side chains and backbones

Question 1, continued 

v.	 What one amino acid substitution could make this interaction stronger?  What one 
amino acid substitution could make this interaction weaker?  Justify your answer in each 
case. 

III. HγD crystallin protein is known to be involved in cataract formation in the eye.  Cataracts form 
when several proteins in the eye bond to one another to create a very large insoluble multi-protein 
complex. 

There is a point mutation that changes the arginine normally found at position 14 to a cysteine.  
Children with this mutation develop cataracts.  The overall 3-D structure of the protein remains 
the same despite this substitution. 

Both in the wild type and this mutant version of the HγD crystallin protein there is also a cysteine 
at position 110.  Click on the button labeled “Residues 14 and 110” to see the location of these two 
amino acids. 

f) Are the amino acids at positions 14 and 110 found in the inside or on the outside of the HγD-
Crys structure? 

g) Consider two molecules of mutant HγD crystallin protein. Recall that these molecules would 
have cysteine residues in both positions 14 and 110.  What type of interaction could form between 
these two molecules? 

h) How could interaction in part g above lead to the development of a cataract?

Question 2 

The enzyme Phosphofructokinase (PFK) catalyzes the conversion of fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) to 
fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate (FBP), in step 3 of glycolysis.

∆Go  = −3. 4

fructose 1,6-bisphosphate + ADP 

a) What two functions does ATP serve in this coupled reaction? 

b) Draw and label an energy diagram for this reaction.  Include the relative energy levels of the 
°
substrates and the products, the activation energy and the ∆G  for the reaction.

Question 2, continued 

c)  What is the free energy change of the phosphofructokinase reaction under these cellular 
conditions (37°C)?  Show your work.  Is the reaction spontaneous under these conditions? 

Phosphofructokinase (PFK) is the primary site for regulation of the glycolytic pathway.  The 
activity of PFK is dependent on the energy status of the cell. 

d)  Why would a cell regulate glycolysis? 

e)  What is the specific signal or molecule(s) to which PFK responds? 

f)  Why does this mechanism of regulation make sense? 

g)  In certain tumor cells, an enzyme called ATPase becomes abnormally active, resulting in 
increased hydrolysis of ATP to ADP. What would be the effect on the overall rate of glycolysis 
in these cells?

Question 4 

Rubisco is a key enzyme in the dark phase of photosynthesis, and is the most abundant protein on 
Earth. It makes up roughly 50% of the protein content of chloroplasts.  Rubisco catalyzes the 
addition of one molecule of CO2 to a five carbon sugar ribulose 1,5-biphosphate.  The resulting six-
carbon sugar is unstable, and splits into two molecules of 3-phosphoglyceric acid.  

a)  You happen to have some 14CO2 around your lab, so you decide to place your favorite fichus 
into a large hermetically sealed container, and pump some 14CO2 into the container to mix with 
regular atmosphere already in there. After some time, you move the fichus to a non-radioactive 
environment. A quick read with a Geiger counter reveals that the plant is now slightly 
radioactive. 

i.	

If you moved the plant after 1 minute, and analyzed the cells immediately, where 
would you expect to find radioactivity? Circle all that apply: 

Evenly distributed throughout the cell 
Mostly in the chloroplasts   
 
Mostly in the nucleus 
Mostly in the mitochondria 

 

 

carbohydrates 
nucleic acids 
proteins 
lipids 

ii.	

If you moved the plant after 1 minute and analyzed the cells the next day, would your 
answer change? Why or why not? 

iii.	

If you moved the plant the next day, where would you expect to find radioactivity in a 
fichus leaf cell? Circle all that apply: 

Evenly distributed throughout the cell 
Mostly in the chloroplasts   
 
Mostly in the nucleus 
Mostly in the mitochondria 

 

 

carbohydrates 

nucleic acids 
proteins 
lipids

Question 4, continued 

iv.  You dream that your pet goat eats your experimental plant.  In such a scenario, where 
would you now find 14CO2? 

Rubisco is a very inefficient enzyme—it only processes about three CO2 molecules per second. 
Inside a plant chloroplast it forms large complexes with eight active sites in each.  The complex 
does not appear to be allosterically regulated—each subunit appears to be very rigid, and each 
active site operates independently from all other active sites in the complex. Recall that 
chloroplasts are small organelles. 

b)  Propose a hypothesis for why Rubisco forms large complexes, and an experiment to test this 
hypothesis.  Assume that you can create cells with any kind of mutant Rubisco protein you 
would like.
