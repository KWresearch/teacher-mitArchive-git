                        You are given a microscope slide that contains both
                        living cells and empty membrane vesicles. When observed
                        in a microscope, the two are indistinguishable. What is
                        so special about the cell?
1      Introduction     At what level does MIT focus its study of biology? Why?
                        What are the characteristics required for something to
                        be considered alive?
                        What is the relationship between organisms and the
                        environment in which they live?
                        What is a molecule? How many different kinds of
                        molecules are present in each cell?
                        What do we mean when we say "structure of a molecule?"
                        How does a molecule's structure enable its function?
2      Biochemistry I   What forces govern/enable molecular interations in a
                        cell?
                        What are the fundamental types of biological
                        macromolecules? What are the functions of each type of
                        macromolecule in a cell?
                        We have learned that biological macromolecules are made
                        from a small number of simple subunits. For example,
                        proteins are made of only 20 different amino acids. Yet
                        each cell needs to manufacture different protein
                        molecules that serve wide range of functions. (a)
                        Estimate the number of types of protein molecules each
3      Biochemistry II  cell needs to make simultaneously. Is it on the order
                        of 10s? 100s? 1000s? 10,000s? 100,000s? or millions?
                        (b) These proteins assume a wide variety of shapes that
                        allow them to perform their different functions. How is
                        this variability achieved?
                        What functions do sidechains of amino acids serve in a
                        protein?
                        What is the function of the membrane in a cell?
4      Biochemistry III Why are certain elements of human diet designated as
                        "essential?" Do yeast have "essential" diet elements?
                        What is the significance of a delta G of a given
                        reaction?
                        Why is ATP a common intermediate in many reactions in a
                        cell?
                        Where in the ATP molecule is the energy stored? Why
                        does this particular way of storing energy allow ATP to
5      Biochemistry IV  serve as an "energy storage" molecule for the cell?
                        What other molecules do you imagine could perform this
                        role?
                        Why are catalysts needed for energetically favorable
                        reactions in a cell?
                        What do catalysts do to speed up reactions?
                        How do catalysts accomplish their functions?
                        In what way is the cell's use of ATP and NADH similar?
                        Why was it advantageous for a cell to develop
6      Biochemistry V   glycolysis?
                        Why are the enzymes that catalyze the steps of
                        glycolysis so similar in yeast and in humans?
                        Why couldn't organisms develop oxidative respiration
7      Biochemistry VI  before photosynthesis arose?
                        What was the effect of advent of noncyclic
                        photophosphorylation on the environment on Earth?

LECÂ TOPICS                  LECTUREÂ QUESTIONS
                               Even before the discovery of what genetic
                               material is, scientists knew that it has three
                               characteristics. What are they?
                               Explain why Griffith isolated live SIII and not
                               live SII from the mouse that died after the
8      DNA as Genetic Material injection of RII + heat-killed SIII.
                               Avery's results were published in 1944.
                               Nevertheless, acceptance of DNA as transforming
                               principle didn't come until 1950s. Was the
                               experiment not convincing, or was there another
                               reason for this delay?
                               What is the key feature of DNA that allows it to
                               -encode information?
                               -pass information from one generation to the
                               next?
                               -replicate?
                               mutate (change its information)?
                               Near the bottom of Watson and Crick's 1953 paper
9      Molecular Biology I     on the discovery of the structure of DNA is the
                               following sentence:
                               "It has not escaped our notice that the specific
                               pairing we have postulated immediately suggests
                               a possible copying mechanism for the genetic
                               material."
                               How does the structure of DNA suggest a copying
                               mechanism?
                               Why is the ability to copy DNA so important?
                               DNA replication is remarkably accurate. Do you
                               think it would have been possible to evolve a
                               more accurate polymerase? If so, would it have
                               been evolutionarily advantageous? Why or why
10     Molecular Biology II    not?
       Process of Science      If there existed a 3'-->5' DNA polymerase, where
                               would the energy for catalyzing the bond
                               formation come in that reaction?
                               Would a scheme in the question above be more or
                               less energetically favorable for an organism to
                               employ?
                               Why is it important for the cell to be able to
                               distinguish parental (old) DNA strands from
11     Molecular Biology III   their daughter (new) DNA strands?
                               What led scientists to investigate the
                               relationship between DNA and proteins?
                               How is information transfered from a nucleic
12     Molecular Biology IV    acid to a protein?
                               Why was the need for a transitional molecule
                               postulated?
                               Why can't a patient infected with HIV ever be
                               cured?
                               Why are there loops when a human DNA is
                               hybridized w mRNA for the same gene?
13     Gene Regulation I       How is it possible that your skin cells and
                               liver cells contain the same genes but perform
                               different functions?
                               What types of mutants in the lac operon would
                               lead to constant expression of the lacZ, lacY,
                               and lacA genes?

                                           Why do we say that Ecology is a

                                           What are "emergent properties" and

                                           In the early stages of life on
                                           Earth, Photosynthesis greatly

                                           Why is it fair to say that many

                                           Why is it legitimate to view the

                                           would be limiting for two different

                                           Why is it important that the
                                           nutrients cycle through the
                                           biosphere?
                                           The flux of CO2 to the atmosphere
20     Limiting Factors and BioGeoChemical due to human activities is only a
       Cycles                              small fraction of the flux due to
                                           global respiration. Why, then, is it
                                           causing a significant increase in
                                           the reservoir of CO2 in the
                                           atmosphere?
