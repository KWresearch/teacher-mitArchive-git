<p></p>
<p>So, we're going to finish now by just talking more about this amazing  immune system we have, the adaptive immune system. As I said on Friday,  this is really an astonishing recognition system that just plays a key  role in us being able to survive in this world that's full of bacteria,  and yeast, and fungi, and viruses, parasites. There are things just all  the time trying to do us in, and the reason we don't succumb is because  we have this amazing immune system. And there are several features about  it which I summarized the other day. One is its diversity. It has this  incredible ability to recognize entities, including things that are  synthesized in a lab that had never been seen on Earth before. It's  amazing in terms of that side of it.</p>
<p>Coupled with this is this  incredible specificity. As I indicated the other day, for example, if it  was seeing a benzene ring with a methyl on it, it might be able to  recognize this, but it could tell the difference from having the methyl  over here. It's got that level of sophistication. In spite of that, in  spite of the fact that it can recognize everything else, it's able to  avoid self recognition, which is a bit of a trick if you think about it,  that you have a system that's able to see essentially anything,  including things that never existed before.</p>
<p>And how does it avoid  seeing all of our molecules, and all the many, many things that makes us  up? So, it has to be able to tell self from non-self. And then, I also  talked about this memory aspects of the immune system, that if you get  exposed to a virus or bacterium or something, but the first immune  response is relatively weak. But then if you get subsequently exposed,  you get a very powerful response. And that's the principle of a vaccine.  If you think someone is going to be exposed to chickenpox but they  haven't had it, if you could somehow elicit the initial response without  making them sick by using a killed virus or something like that; polio  is one of the examples you hear about in the paper right at the moment.</p>
<p>Then,  if someone does encounter that virus or that bacterium, because that's  second response, it's very quick and it's very powerful, and that's what  vaccines are all about. So, the issue, I guess, today is how does that  happen? And this is one of these amazing insights into biology that's  come by an application of all these tools, recombinant DNA, and  sequencing, and all the fancy sort of things we've been talking about in  the past few lectures. So, the first part I need to let you know, is  there are two parts to this immune response, or two kinds of responses.</p>
<p>One's  called the humoral response and one's called the cellular response. And  this takes place in the plasma of your blood. So, in the liquid part of  the blood if you spin down the red cells and the white cells, what  you're left with is the plasma. And, what this humoral response response  does, it's able to target bacteria, viruses, proteins. And the  recognition is done by a special kind of protein called antibodies.</p>
<p>And  I'll tell you about that in just a moment because they're a very  important class of protein in this Earth. And the cellular immune  response is carried out by a special kind of white blood cell. For this  lecture I think I'll just abbreviate those as WBC if I need it. What  this targets is not the actual pathogen itself. But it targets cells  that are infected with a virus or a bacterium, etc.</p>
<p>and that might  seem to be even a little bit more of a trick. It's hard enough probably  to figure out how to take something that's an entity like a virus  that's floating around your blood and figure out how to find something  that binds to it. What do you do if the thing's gone into one of your  own cells and it's hiding out in their replicating in the same way that,  let's say, a phage does or something like that How do you see one of  your own cells that's been infected by something like that? And there is  a special type of cells called cytotoxic T cell that's very important.</p>
<p>It's  often abbreviated as that. So let me first say a word about antibodies.  These are proteins that consist of four polypeptide chains. Two of the  chains are bigger. So they're called heavy chains. There's two of those.  And there are two chains that are smaller, so those are usually called  light chains. So, there's four of them altogether. And, ignoring  secondary structure and stuff for the moment, let me just sort of give  you an idea of how these are laid out.</p>
<p>These are the two heavy  chains. And these are joined together by disulfide bridges. You remember  disulfide bridges? If you had two cystines they can form a covalent  bond between them under oxidizing conditions. So, those heavy chains are  locked together. They're actually physically covalently joined. In  fact, there's the light chains here. So, this is the light. And this  part up here is highly variable between different antibodies. And the  part down here is constant between antibodies.</p>
<p>And it's this huge  amount of variability that the body produces many, many, many types of  antibodies, and then figures out which ones will work to find the  particular entity it's trying to recognize. And I'll come back and tell  you in a moment how that is done. There is a diagram of what I showed  you, but of course these are proteins. They have three-dimensional  structures, and so if you were to look at them with the secondary  structure showing, you can see the different, especially here, a lot of  beta sheets should be leaping out at you. Now, the part where the  recognition is done is up at this end.</p>
<p>So, it's essentially right  here. And here's a little movie. You could see how the thing looks in  three dimensional space. You see the part that's over on the left at the  moment; that's the light chain and the blue chain is that part of the  heavy chain complex with the light chain. And here is the, it's been  tilted up this way so this is the yellow and blue part you were looking  at And the recognition pocket is right at the end of that.</p>
<p>And at  this picture, it's showing how a particular protein was shown in red.  This is an anti-body that can very, very precisely recognize that  particular protein. You can't really tell it from the three-dimensional  shape shown on the left because it just shows the secondary structure.  But, if you could see the full space filling model, you'd be amazed. The  surfaces are absolutely complementary. It goes back to one of those  principles I've said over and over and over again that so much of  biology works by having complementary surfaces.</p>
<p>And there's a  little movie you could see how this thing is setting up there at the  top. So, these antibodies are produced by a special type of what are  called B cells. These are cells that play roles in the humoral part of  the immune system. And they're called plasma cells. And each plasma cell  makes one particular antibody. And that's it.</p>
<p>So you have many  different types of plasma cells, but each one only expresses one  particular gene that encodes one particular antibody. So, for years,  this is something that people struggled with just conceptually. They  could sort of calculate that there were so many antibodies that if your  entire genome was nothing but antibody genes, we still wouldn't have  enough DNA to account for all this ability to recognize things. So, some  other principle had to be involved.</p>
<p>And there are all sorts of  speculations about what it was. I had shown you, I'd managed to not get  Bob Horvitz's thing on here, but this then, who is our fourth Nobel  laureate, I've been sort of working through these. Susumu Tonegawa, who  is in the cancer center, he's in the biology department. He's also  heading, now, this Picower Center of learning and memory. So, since  doing this work I'm telling you about on the immune system, he's gone to  do some wonderful stuff more on the big problem of how we learn, and  trying to get more molecular insights into that process. But what Susumu  managed to figure out was that this variation and diversity in the  immune system was, at its roots, a combinatorial sort of process.</p>
<p>So,  if you look in the DNA of a zygote, so that's the fertilized egg. We're  just getting started with one of our cells. You've got a single cell.  We're looking in the DNA to see what would happen. We come to the part  of the DNA that's involved in producing antibodies. What he found was  that if you looked along the DNA, there were sequences that looked like  part of the stuff that you'd find in antibodies, but there were a whole  series of them. So, he called this particular segment V1, V2, V3, up to  VN. There were a whole set of these basically side by side by side by  side. There are about 300 of these in humans.</p>
<p>And then down the  DNA a little bit he found another set of sequences that are all  variations of each other. And these were given D1, D2, D3, D4, up to DN.  And there are many of these. And then down the DNA a little farther,  there were three other sections that were called joining segments. They  were called J1, J2, J3. And a little bit farther down there was a block  of DNA coding the constant part of this polypeptide chain that goes into  an antibody. And what Susumu Tonegawa was able to show, and this led to  the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>So, what happens during the development of these  B cells is there are rearrangements. And a lot of DNA is thrown around.  And the basic strategy is to take, if you think this as being column A,  you take one from column A, one from column B, just picking them  randomly, one from column C over here, and throw away everything else.  So you might have, for example, in one B cell, you might have V32, D15,  J2, and then the constant region.</p>
<p>And, what's in between is an  intron that will be spliced out at the time that the gene's expressed.  In another B cell, you might have V11, D22, J3. So, this rearrangement  is random in the sense of which V segment is chosen, which D segment is  chosen, and which J segment. I don't mean that it all just joins  together in a completely uncontrolled way. And then the rest of the DNA  is deleted. So a consequence of this, is each B cell expresses only one  antibody.</p>
<p>It's true that they're diploid, but only one chromosome  is expressed. So that's how they avoid, you can imagine they might make  to two. But they only make one. In the process, as you can see, that  part is random. Furthermore, the joining events are what I think you  could call sloppy. And this leads to even more variation than you would  have imagined simply looking at the number of segments. So, what this  part of the process does is it explains why the system can be has the  diversity it has, because it's using this combinatorial process. If you  know the number you can calculate how many possible combinations there  are.</p>
<p>But then there's much more variation because when it joins  together a little segments that are joined are done in a sloppy way so  that the DNA sequence that shows up where the joints occur doesn't look  like anything that was in the DNA at all. It was something like a  polymerase that wasn't very faithful copying and making mistakes as it  went along. So what the system does, is it doesn't get you a response.</p>
<p>It  just explains why there is so much diversity, and why it is that I can  go into the lab and synthesize a compound that's never been on this  earth before, inject a rabbit to it, and the rabbit will probably  produce an antibody that's able to recognize that. That's because it's  made this whole set of them. And they all are going to have somewhat  different surfaces. And they make so many that one of those surfaces is  going to fit the molecule that I'm testing. You can sort of see, that's  only part of the trick.</p>
<p>So, how do you now get an immune response?  Because you've got millions of these things. But what you now need is a  whole lot of one particular antibody that's going to recognize the  pathogen that you are being exposed to. And the principle of that is  really cute. It's a process called clonal selection. And the idea is  that each B cell displays a sample of its antibody on its surface.</p>
<p>So,  we might think of it this sort of way, that after this process is  through we have one B cell. Of course, these are way out of proportion.  The cells would be huge, and these would be molecules. So, they're  small. But here would be an antibody that can recognize squares, say,  this one would have an antibody that could recognize triangle. This one  would have an antibody that could recognize a semicircle and so on,  millions and millions of different shapes. And these cells don't divide,  though. They've been made, and they just sit there. And then, when you  stimulate them with an antigen, and I used that word the other day, an  antigen is just anything that will elicit an immune response. It could  be a piece of a foreign protein, carbohydrate, just about anything  that's a small molecule you've made in the lab. But let's say we exposed  now this individual to an antigen, which in this case can fit into that  receptor.</p>
<p>And what happens, then, this one becomes stimulated to  divide. So what we have now is this B cell that has this antigen stuck  into its binding pocket on the sample of its antibody. And then, the  cells divide and they give rise to two populations. They give rise to  the plasma cells, which are very short-lived, on the order of a few  days. And what these do, so they would look like this, what they do is  secrete antibodies into the plasma. So what you end up with, then, are a  lot of these antibodies that have exactly the specificity that the  original sample had on the outside of that particular B cell.</p>
<p>This  takes a few days. So back when we were talking about the discovery of  DNA, I was telling you about Streptococcus pneumonia, and you get  infected by the Streptococcus. And there would be this period of five or  six days where this person was very sick, and then either they'd  survive or they didn't survive. If they survived, they'd been able to  mount an immune response and make these antibodies before they got  killed by the bacteria. And the reason it takes a few days is when you  start out there could be just one B cell that's able with an antibody,  makes an antibody that is capable of recognizing the capsule. Maybe  there are a few.</p>
<p>Anyway, but they were very, very tiny number, and  there were probably a lot of bacteria. So what had to happen, then, is  that the original cell or small number of cells that could recognize the  Streptococcus had to be amplified. They had to make a lot of plasma  cells that have the potential to make the antibody, and then they had to  secrete the antibody into the plasma. And I'll tell you in just a  minute some of the strategies that that uses to help kill the pathogen.</p>
<p>And  the other population, just before I go on there, are what are called  memory cells. There's not as many of these made, but they're very  long-lived. And so, what they have is exactly the same capacity to make  the same antibody, but they're not actively dividing. They'll just sit  there, float around in your bloodstream, and then if you get a second  exposure to the antigen, you get a very fast and strong response because  the selection for finding the cells that had antibodies that can  recognize the antigen has already been done. And there's already a few  of them around, and then after you do that then you're able to make,  once again, the binding of the antigen stimulates these guys to start  dividing.</p>
<p>They make a lot of plasma cells. And going back to the  principal of vaccination, your first response is fairly modest. But if  you get a second response, what you're doing now is the memory cells are  already there. They have the specificity for recognizing the antigen in  question. And you can make a whole lot of them. So, if you had  chickenpox when you were little, you have memory cells that know how to  recognize the chickenpox virus. And then when your kid gets chickenpox  like mine did, I didn't get sick because I had memory cells that were  able to recognize that. OK, so what happens if you get an antibody? How  does this help the organism, or in our case someone like you or me,  avoid getting sick? So there are a couple of strategies.</p>
<p>One we  might think of is bind and block. For example, you are a virus and you  get covered by antibodies. Viruses: it's exactly the same logic as  bacteriophage, except that instead of affecting a bacterial cell a virus  would be infecting one of our cells. And as the virus has receptors or  something, it has to recognize something on my cell, in order to attach  and then to inject its DNA. So if we've got an antibody sitting here,  then it can't find its way to the host cell.</p>
<p>And then, there are a  couple of other ways. They can target for destruction. And there's  basically two ways. There's something called the complement system, that  if it is able to recognize, say, the bacterial cell and their  antibodies are sticking to the outside, what the complement system does  is it's able to make little pores in the membrane of the pathogen. And I  think one of the things I hope you will remember is that one of the  secrets of life is that we have to keep that membrane around there.</p>
<p>We  have to keep all of our insides in, and the rest of the world outside.  We have hydrogen ion gradients across the membrane. So, if you want to  kill a cell and you, say, insert a protein that has a little hole and  it, and that thing sits and sticks in the membrane, that cell is dead.  It can't maintain an ion gradient, and things can leak out through the  hole. So that's one of the ways of killing it.</p>
<p>The other ways are  macrophages. These are a type of white blood cell, as well, are very  good at recognizing bacteria that have antibodies stuck to the outside.  And in fact, that was the principle of that. We have the Streptococcus,  and we have the capsule. And you may remember that little movie I showed  of a white blood cell that was trying to eat it, and it couldn't get  hold of the thing, whereas we saw another example where a bacterium  without a capsule, there was sort of principle I said is that the white  blood cell was able to recognize the bacterium and then it pinches it  off inside of a membrane bubble. And I sort of said at least in  principle that there is another little bubble with poisons, and it  brings it together so that you have the bacterium and the poison  together inside of some intracellular compartment, so that macrophages  know how to kill a bacterium if they bring it inside.</p>
<p>The problem  in the case of something like Streptococcus was being able to recognize  it because it couldn't get hold of that capsule. So, those antibodies  that guy made during that five day thing decorate the outside of the  capsule because their specificity is to recognize the capsule and bind  to it. But a macrophage, even if it couldn't get hold of the bacterium  with a capsule is able to ingest something that has antibodies stuck on  the outside.</p>
<p>And once it gets inside, it can kill the bacterium.  In fact, immunologists call this process opsinization, which is derived  from the Greek words for seasoning, like putting salt on your food. And  the idea was that when they were giving that word, with these  macrophages, which liked to eat bacteria, they have a little seasoning  that they have these little antibodies decorating their outsides. So  here you can see it least in the humoral response how you generate a  whole lot of diversity. Then this principle of what's called clonal  selection identifies a B cell that's able to make an antibody that can  recognize the particular pathogen or molecule that you're being exposed  to amplify that, make a lot of antibodies, and then it can either just  stick to the pathogen like a virus and mess it up that way, or it can  decorate it if it's something like a bacterium, and then pull in a  couple of other systems that are capable of killing the pathogen.</p>
<p>I mean, it's an absolutely amazing system. It sounded like science fiction when I first heard about it.</p>
<p>When  I heard people talking about it, everyone could see there was an  information theory problem. How do you encode all that information with  just this amount of DNA in a cell? Now we understand. And there's even  another part that I'm leaving out here. But once this whole thing has  been selected, there's another whole round of sort of refinement where  the cells do kind of a very kind of localized mutagenesis one base pair  at a time in the vicinity of this binding pocket. And they're able to  make, if they're given more time and more exposure to the antigen, they  can make a better and better binding surface until you begin to approach  sort of the theoretical maximum.</p>
<p>Now, the T cell, in this case  this involves the cytotoxic T cells, and they have a specific  recognition molecule on their surface. It's called the T cell receptor.  And in this case, it's attached. So, this is the membrane of the T cell.</p>
<p>And  this is the cytoplasm down on this side. There's a little bit of the  protein that goes into that. And then there's an alpha helix that goes  through, and then a segment that comes up like this. And there's another  chain that does the same thing. So, there are two segments that span  the membrane. This thing is anchored in the membrane. And then it's  essentially the same principle as with antibodies. There's a variable  region, and there's a constant region. And to a first approximation  anyway the logic by which the cell generates a huge, diverse set of T  cell receptors is the same logic that underlies the generation of a  whole lot of different antibodies by taking segments, joining them,  picking them randomly out of column A, column B, and then joining them  together, sloppy joining all the other processes to increase the pool of  diversity. Now, what these B cells are able to do, then, these T cells  are able to do is something quite remarkable.</p>
<p>We have on our  cells, this is, say, one of my cells, little sort of proteins that  function as sort of display cases or something. And what they do is they  show samples of all of the different proteins that are inside us at any  given moment. Proteins are turned over, and chopped up, and things are  recycled and so on. So there are always little peptides, little pieces  of proteins around.</p>
<p>And, the display case, if you will, has got a  major histocompatibility complex, which is usually abbreviated as MHC  because it's such an unwieldy name. And there are many, many alleles of  MHC in the population, which means that we each have, for the most part,  a sort of individually designed display case for showing these  peptides. The property of these display cases, they take some little  piece of a protein just a few amino acids long, it binds into the  display case, and that sticks on the outside of our cell. And so we have  a lot of these. And so on the surface of our cells are these little  individualized MHC display cases showing little samples of the peptides  of the proteins from the proteins that are inside us.</p>
<p>So, if  everything is fine, all of the peptides that are in the display cases  are our own. And I'll tell you in a minute why that doesn't cause a  problem. But then if you get infected by a virus, and it injects DNA or  its RNA inside of you and then starts to replicate, now you have some  virus proteins that don't belong to you. They get chopped into pieces,  and they begin to appear on these major histocompatibility display  cases.</p>
<p>So if you think here, this could be, perhaps, a little  piece of, let's call it self protein, it could be a little piece of my  own DNA polymerase or something like that. And over in this one, let's  say we have a little piece of a viral protein. So that's something that  would not be normally there. So what this T-cell receptor does is it  recognizes, so this is non-self or foreign. What the T-cell receptor  does is it recognizes these foreign peptides.</p>
<p>But it does it in  the context of the display case. Otherwise the peptides would be  floating around. So, in essence, the T-cell receptor, if this is a  cytotoxic T cell it's able to see the individual display case with a bit  of viral protein in it. And then it knows that it should kill that cell  because it's got something in it that shouldn't be there. I mean, it's a  brutal but very effective strategy. If we applied it here, I go around  if I found any of you had a cold, I could just take a gun and shoot you  and it would cut down on the number of sick days for the rest of us  because it wouldn't spread the infection. But in essence, at a molecular  level, that's the strategy.</p>
<p>Try to identify a cell that's got  something inside it that shouldn't be there, and then the cytotoxic T  cells kill that. And let me just show you a couple of quick movies of  this. At this point, these will be the last protein structures you're  going to see from me, I think. Here's a representation of that T cell  just as a cartoon as you see it in a textbook. Here it is. This is the  binding pocket up here. And there's a little tiny peptide, nine and  amino acids from the HIV virus bound in here. Somebody did a crystal  structure, and was able to work that out. And, if you look at it in  three dimensions, you'll see how beautifully this little binding pocket  and the peptide lies in there. So that red part is the piece of chalk,  and the other part is what I'm describing as my hand.</p>
<p>It's not a  bad analogy, actually, even on a structural level. And then, here's  another representation. This is sort of showing the hand with a piece of  peptide in it. And then the T cell is able to see this whole thing in  recognize it. And, if you look at it in a structural form, here's the  little peptide. This is the part, the display case you're looking at.</p>
<p>And  here's the T cell receptor now fitting down in seeing the peptide in  the context of this major histocompatibility antigen. And again, these  things are all beautifully complementary a three dimensional level.  Again, at the heart of this is the principle of complementary surfaces  fitting together that underlies so much biology. What's this? This is a  tumor cell.</p>
<p>These are cytotoxic T cells that have recognized this  tumor cell is doing something it shouldn't that a normal cell wouldn't  do. And it's attacking it, and it's killing them. So, not only does the  cellular immune response help us against things like infections from  virus and bacteria, it also will help prevent cancer. So obviously there  must be some trick here to why we don't see our own peptides. This is  the self versus non-self And it's a relatively simple principle. So,  distinguishing self versus non-self is a problem throughout this whole  part of the immune system. And here's the principle.</p>
<p>During  embryogenesis, the cell makes, the organism I guess, makes the  assumption. I mean obviously it's not thinking about it. This is a way  of understanding what's happening. It makes the assumption that no  pathogens are present. Any B or T cell recognizing something must be  recognizing itself. And so, it deletes those B and T cells. This process  is given a name. It's called education. And it happens in this organ  called thymus.</p>
<p>So, and then after birth, then it switches. And now  B and T cells, if they recognize something, the body makes the  assumption it must be a pathogen. And it goes after it. We have this  huge human disease where that goes awry: rheumatoid arthritis, or  multiple sclerosis are cases where the self versus non-self recognition  has broken down. OK, so for example multiple sclerosis, a very difficult  disease, because there's a gradual deterioration of the nervous system.  And what happens is the body of the person with that mounts an immune  response against the sheath that covers the nerves, and then that sheath  gets destroyed, and that the nervous system, somebody with multiple  sclerosis, starts to break down.</p>
<p>And so, if you lose this self  versus non-self you get what's called an autoimmune disease. You may  have heard that phrase. It's very important. It's a very tough thing if  you have one of these. But that's what lies at the heart of it. And  people still don't know, but there is certainly some evidence for some  of these that are triggered by a bacterial infection.</p>
<p>So, it could  be that perhaps maybe a bacterial protein looked close enough to one of  your own proteins, that somehow you got antibodies against the  bacterium, and then it turned out it could also recognize something in  your body. There are some other immune diseases you probably heard of,  the baby in a bubble kind of thing. There are a few people who were born  who have no immune response at all because one of the basic pieces for  doing those DNA gymnastics I talked about isn't there. Those people have  no B cells or T cells.</p>
<p>They die unless they are absolutely  shielded from everything else. And that's one of those cases when gene  therapy, if you could get that gene into that person, they'd have an  immune system and they could live. There are other kinds of immune  deficiencies that are less extreme, but nevertheless, people will be  susceptible to infection. The other one which I've already talked about,  but now you can see in another context is AIDS, Acquired Immune  Deficiency Syndrome. And I told you what the HIV virus does is it  injects its RNA. That makes a DNA copy. It goes into protein. The cells  that it affects our special type of T cell called T helper cells. What  they are doesn't matter so much, but what's important to know is they're  needed for both branches of the immune system. They play roles in the  humoral response and cellular response.</p>
<p>So, someone who gets  infected with HIV, what happens is the virus is replicating in these  helper T cells. And so their immune system is slowly, slowly being  knocked away. And the last thing, which I won't have time to talk about,  but if you have an allergy, that's an overreaction of the immune  system. So this is my last lecture. I've got to let you guys go. It's  been a true pleasure to talk to you; A real honor to meet many of you.  And many of you put a lot of effort into those little answers.</p>
<p>I  really, really appreciate that. For those who'd rather not be here, I  hope that somewhere down the line when you're confronted with a medical  situation dealing with your parents, your child, yourself, whatever it  is, that some of the stuff that you heard will reemerge to help you with  those decisions. And I wish you the best of luck for the rest of the  course, and the rest of your careers at MIT and beyond. Thanks very  much. And as I leave, too, I've had the pleasure of just having an  incredible teaching staff.</p>
<p>I don't think you guys know how hard they work behind the scenes, but thanks to all of you for being with me.</p>
