1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:05
So, we're going to finish now by
just talking more about this amazing

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:11
immune system we have,
the adaptive immune system.

3
00:00:11 --> 00:00:17
As I said on Friday, this is really
an astonishing recognition system

4
00:00:17 --> 00:00:23
that just plays a key role in us
being able to survive in this world

5
00:00:23 --> 00:00:29
that's full of bacteria,
and yeast, and fungi, and viruses,

6
00:00:29 --> 00:00:34
parasites.
There are things just all the time

7
00:00:34 --> 00:00:38
trying to do us in,
and the reason we don't succumb is

8
00:00:38 --> 00:00:42
because we have this amazing immune
system.  And there are several

9
00:00:42 --> 00:00:47
features about it which I summarized
the other day.

10
00:00:47 --> 00:00:51
One is its diversity.
It has this incredible ability to

11
00:00:51 --> 00:00:55
recognize entities,
including things that are

12
00:00:55 --> 00:01:00
synthesized in a lab that had never
been seen on Earth before.

13
00:01:00 --> 00:01:05
It's amazing in terms of that side
of it.  Coupled with this is this

14
00:01:05 --> 00:01:10
incredible specificity.
As I indicated the other day,

15
00:01:10 --> 00:01:16
for example, if it was seeing a
benzene ring with a methyl on it,

16
00:01:16 --> 00:01:21
it might be able to recognize this,
but it could tell the difference

17
00:01:21 --> 00:01:27
from having the methyl over here.
It's got that level of

18
00:01:27 --> 00:01:31
sophistication.
In spite of that,

19
00:01:31 --> 00:01:34
in spite of the fact that it can
recognize everything else,

20
00:01:34 --> 00:01:37
it's able to  avoid self recognition,

21
00:01:37 --> 00:01:46
which is a bit of a trick if you

22
00:01:46 --> 00:01:49
think about it,
that you have a system that's able

23
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
to see essentially anything,
including things that never existed

24
00:01:51 --> 00:01:54
before.  And how does it avoid
seeing all of our molecules,

25
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
and all the many, many things that
makes us up?  So,

26
00:01:57 --> 00:02:00
it has to be able to tell self from
non-self.

27
00:02:00 --> 00:02:04
And then, I also talked about this
memory aspects of the immune system,

28
00:02:04 --> 00:02:09
that if you get exposed to a virus
or bacterium or something,

29
00:02:09 --> 00:02:14
but the first immune response is
relatively weak.

30
00:02:14 --> 00:02:19
But then if you get subsequently
exposed, you get a very powerful

31
00:02:19 --> 00:02:24
response.  And that's the principle
of a vaccine.  If you think someone

32
00:02:24 --> 00:02:29
is going to be exposed to chickenpox
but they haven't had it,

33
00:02:29 --> 00:02:34
if you could somehow elicit the
initial response without making them

34
00:02:34 --> 00:02:39
sick by using a killed virus or
something like that;

35
00:02:39 --> 00:02:42
polio is one of the examples you
hear about in the paper right at the

36
00:02:42 --> 00:02:46
moment.  Then,
if someone does encounter that virus

37
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
or that bacterium,
because that's second response,

38
00:02:50 --> 00:02:54
it's very quick and it's very
powerful, and that's what vaccines

39
00:02:54 --> 00:02:58
are all about.
So, the issue,

40
00:02:58 --> 00:03:02
I guess, today is how does that
happen?  And this is one of these

41
00:03:02 --> 00:03:06
amazing insights into biology that's
come by an application of all these

42
00:03:06 --> 00:03:10
tools, recombinant DNA,
and sequencing, and all the fancy

43
00:03:10 --> 00:03:14
sort of things we've been talking
about in the past few lectures.

44
00:03:14 --> 00:03:20
So, the first part I need to let you
know, is there are two parts to this

45
00:03:20 --> 00:03:26
immune response, or two
kinds of responses.

46
00:03:26 --> 00:03:40
One's called the humoral response

47
00:03:40 --> 00:03:46
and one's called the cellular
response.  And this takes place in

48
00:03:46 --> 00:03:52
the plasma of your blood.
So, in the liquid part of the blood

49
00:03:52 --> 00:03:58
if you spin down the red cells and
the white cells,

50
00:03:58 --> 00:04:04
what you're left with is the plasma.

51
00:04:04 --> 00:04:09
And, what this humoral response
response does,

52
00:04:09 --> 00:04:14
it's able to target bacteria,
viruses, proteins.

53
00:04:14 --> 00:04:30
And the recognition is done by a

54
00:04:30 --> 00:04:37
special kind of protein called
antibodies.  And I'll tell you about

55
00:04:37 --> 00:04:45
that in just a moment because
they're a very important class of

56
00:04:45 --> 00:04:52
protein in this Earth.
And the cellular immune response is

57
00:04:52 --> 00:05:00
carried out by a special kind of
white blood cell.

58
00:05:00 --> 00:05:15
For this lecture I think I'll just

59
00:05:15 --> 00:05:21
abbreviate those as WBC if I need it.
What this targets is not the actual

60
00:05:21 --> 00:05:26
pathogen itself.
But it targets cells that are

61
00:05:26 --> 00:05:32
infected with a virus or a bacterium,
etc. and that might seem to be even

62
00:05:32 --> 00:05:38
a little bit more of a trick.
It's hard enough probably to figure

63
00:05:38 --> 00:05:43
out how to take something that's an
entity like a virus that's floating

64
00:05:43 --> 00:05:49
around your blood and figure out how
to find something that binds to it.

65
00:05:49 --> 00:05:54
What do you do if the thing's gone
into one of your own cells and it's

66
00:05:54 --> 00:06:00
hiding out in their replicating in
the same way that,

67
00:06:00 --> 00:06:06
let's say, a phage does or something
like that

68
00:06:06 --> 00:06:13
How do you see one of your own cells
that's been infected by something

69
00:06:13 --> 00:06:20
like that?  And there is a special
type of cells called cytotoxic T

70
00:06:20 --> 00:06:27
cell that's very important.
It's often abbreviated as that.

71
00:06:27 --> 00:06:33
So let me first say a word about
antibodies.  These are proteins that

72
00:06:33 --> 00:06:40
consist of four polypeptide chains.
Two of the chains are bigger.  So

73
00:06:40 --> 00:06:47
they're called heavy chains.
There's two of those.  And there

74
00:06:47 --> 00:06:54
are two chains that are smaller,
so those are usually called light

75
00:06:54 --> 00:07:01
chains.  So, there's four
of them altogether.

76
00:07:01 --> 00:07:05
And, ignoring secondary structure
and stuff for the moment,

77
00:07:05 --> 00:07:09
let me just sort of give you an idea
of how these are laid out.

78
00:07:09 --> 00:07:23
These are the two heavy chains.

79
00:07:23 --> 00:07:28
And these are joined together by
disulfide bridges.

80
00:07:28 --> 00:07:34
You remember disulfide bridges?
If you had two cystines they can

81
00:07:34 --> 00:07:39
form a covalent bond between them
under oxidizing conditions.

82
00:07:39 --> 00:07:45
So, those heavy chains are locked
together.  They're actually

83
00:07:45 --> 00:07:50
physically covalently joined.
In fact, there's the light chains

84
00:07:50 --> 00:07:56
here.  So, this is the light.
And this part up here is highly

85
00:07:56 --> 00:08:02
variable between different
antibodies.

86
00:08:02 --> 00:08:07
And the part down here is constant
between antibodies.

87
00:08:07 --> 00:08:13
And it's this huge amount of
variability that the body produces

88
00:08:13 --> 00:08:19
many, many, many types of antibodies,
and then figures out which ones will

89
00:08:19 --> 00:08:25
work to find the particular entity
it's trying to recognize.

90
00:08:25 --> 00:08:31
And I'll come back and tell you in
a moment how that is done.

91
00:08:31 --> 00:08:36
There is a diagram of what I showed
you, but of course these are

92
00:08:36 --> 00:08:41
proteins.  They have
three-dimensional structures,

93
00:08:41 --> 00:08:46
and so if you were to look at them
with the secondary structure showing,

94
00:08:46 --> 00:08:51
you can see the different,
especially here, a lot of beta

95
00:08:51 --> 00:08:57
sheets should be leaping
out at you.

96
00:08:57 --> 00:09:01
Now, the part where the recognition
is done is up at this end.

97
00:09:01 --> 00:09:05
So, it's essentially right here.
And here's a little movie.  You

98
00:09:05 --> 00:09:10
could see how the thing looks in
three dimensional space.

99
00:09:10 --> 00:09:14
You see the part that's over on the
left at the moment; that's the light

100
00:09:14 --> 00:09:19
chain and the blue chain is that
part of the heavy chain complex with

101
00:09:19 --> 00:09:23
the light chain.
And here is the,

102
00:09:23 --> 00:09:27
it's been tilted up this way so this
is the yellow and blue part

103
00:09:27 --> 00:09:32
you were looking at
And the recognition pocket is right

104
00:09:32 --> 00:09:36
at the end of that.
And at this picture,

105
00:09:36 --> 00:09:40
it's showing how a particular
protein was shown in red.

106
00:09:40 --> 00:09:44
This is an anti-body that can very,
very precisely recognize that

107
00:09:44 --> 00:09:48
particular protein.
You can't really tell it from the

108
00:09:48 --> 00:09:52
three-dimensional shape shown on the
left because it just shows the

109
00:09:52 --> 00:09:56
secondary structure.
But, if you could see the full

110
00:09:56 --> 00:10:00
space filling model,
you'd be amazed.  The surfaces are

111
00:10:00 --> 00:10:05
absolutely complementary.
It goes back to one of those

112
00:10:05 --> 00:10:11
principles I've said over and over
and over again that so much of

113
00:10:11 --> 00:10:16
biology works by having
complementary surfaces.

114
00:10:16 --> 00:10:22
And there's a little movie you
could see how this thing is setting

115
00:10:22 --> 00:10:27
up there at the top.
So, these antibodies are produced

116
00:10:27 --> 00:10:33
by a special type of what
are called B cells.

117
00:10:33 --> 00:10:46
These are cells that play roles in
the humoral part of the immune

118
00:10:46 --> 00:10:59
system.  And they're called plasma
cells.  And each plasma cell makes

119
00:10:59 --> 00:11:08
one particular antibody.
And that's it.

120
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12
So you have many different types of
plasma cells, but each one only

121
00:11:12 --> 00:11:17
expresses one particular gene that
encodes one particular antibody.

122
00:11:17 --> 00:11:21
So, for years, this is something
that people struggled with just

123
00:11:21 --> 00:11:25
conceptually.  They could sort of
calculate that there were so many

124
00:11:25 --> 00:11:30
antibodies that if your entire
genome was nothing but antibody

125
00:11:30 --> 00:11:34
genes, we still wouldn't have enough
DNA to account for all this ability

126
00:11:34 --> 00:11:39
to recognize things.
So, some other principle had to be

127
00:11:39 --> 00:11:44
involved.  And there are all sorts
of speculations about what it was.

128
00:11:44 --> 00:11:49
I had shown you, I'd managed to not
get Bob Horvitz's thing on here,

129
00:11:49 --> 00:11:54
but this then, who is our fourth
Nobel laureate,

130
00:11:54 --> 00:12:00
I've been sort of working through
these.

131
00:12:00 --> 00:12:05
Susumu Tonegawa,
who is in the cancer center,

132
00:12:05 --> 00:12:10
he's in the biology department.
He's also heading, now, this

133
00:12:10 --> 00:12:15
Picower Center of learning and
memory.  So, since doing this work

134
00:12:15 --> 00:12:20
I'm telling you about on the immune
system, he's gone to do some

135
00:12:20 --> 00:12:25
wonderful stuff more on the big
problem of how we learn,

136
00:12:25 --> 00:12:30
and trying to get more molecular
insights into that process.

137
00:12:30 --> 00:12:36
But what Susumu managed to figure
out was that this variation and

138
00:12:36 --> 00:12:42
diversity in the immune system was,
at its roots, a combinatorial sort

139
00:12:42 --> 00:12:48
of process.  So,
if you look in the DNA of a zygote,

140
00:12:48 --> 00:12:54
so that's the fertilized egg.  We're
just getting started with one of our

141
00:12:54 --> 00:13:00
cells.  You've got a single cell.
We're looking in the DNA to see

142
00:13:00 --> 00:13:06
what would happen.
We come to the part of the DNA

143
00:13:06 --> 00:13:10
that's involved in producing
antibodies.  What he found was that

144
00:13:10 --> 00:13:15
if you looked along the DNA,
there were sequences that looked

145
00:13:15 --> 00:13:19
like part of the stuff that you'd
find in antibodies,

146
00:13:19 --> 00:13:24
but there were a whole series of
them.  So, he called this particular

147
00:13:24 --> 00:13:28
segment V1, V2,
V3, up to VN.  There were a whole

148
00:13:28 --> 00:13:33
set of these basically side by side
by side by side.

149
00:13:33 --> 00:13:42
There are about 300 of these in
humans.  And then down the DNA a

150
00:13:42 --> 00:13:51
little bit he found another set of
sequences that are all variations of

151
00:13:51 --> 00:14:01
each other.  And these were given D1,
D2, D3, D4, up to DN.

152
00:14:01 --> 00:14:07
And there are many of these.
And then down the DNA a little

153
00:14:07 --> 00:14:13
farther, there were three other
sections that were called joining

154
00:14:13 --> 00:14:20
segments.  They were called J1,
J2, J3.  And a little bit farther

155
00:14:20 --> 00:14:26
down there was a block of DNA coding
the constant part of this

156
00:14:26 --> 00:14:33
polypeptide chain that goes
into an antibody.

157
00:14:33 --> 00:14:37
And what Susumu Tonegawa was able to
show, and this led to the Nobel

158
00:14:37 --> 00:14:42
Prize.  So, what happens during the
development of these B cells is

159
00:14:42 --> 00:14:47
there are rearrangements.
And a lot of DNA is thrown around.

160
00:14:47 --> 00:14:52
And the basic strategy is to take,
if you think this as being column A,

161
00:14:52 --> 00:14:57
you take one from column A, one from
column B, just picking them randomly,

162
00:14:57 --> 00:15:02
one from column C over here,
and throw away everything else.

163
00:15:02 --> 00:15:11
So you might have,
for example, in one B cell,

164
00:15:11 --> 00:15:21
you might have V32, D15, J2,
and then the constant region.

165
00:15:21 --> 00:15:31
And, what's in between is an intron
that will be spliced out at the time

166
00:15:31 --> 00:15:45
that the gene's expressed.
In another B cell, you might

167
00:15:45 --> 00:15:58
have V11, D22, J3.
So, this rearrangement is random in

168
00:15:58 --> 00:16:05
the sense of which V segment is
chosen, which D segment is chosen,

169
00:16:05 --> 00:16:12
and which J segment.  I don't mean
that it all just joins together in a

170
00:16:12 --> 00:16:19
completely uncontrolled way.
And then the rest of the DNA is

171
00:16:19 --> 00:16:34
deleted.

172
00:16:34 --> 00:16:47
So a consequence of this,
is each B cell expresses only one

173
00:16:47 --> 00:17:00
antibody.  It's true that they're
diploid, but only one chromosome

174
00:17:00 --> 00:17:11
is expressed.
So that's how they avoid,

175
00:17:11 --> 00:17:19
you can imagine they might make to
two.  But they only make one.

176
00:17:19 --> 00:17:27
In the process, as you can see,
that part is random.  Furthermore,

177
00:17:27 --> 00:17:36
the joining events are what I think
you could call sloppy.

178
00:17:36 --> 00:17:42
And this leads to even more
variation than you would have

179
00:17:42 --> 00:17:48
imagined simply looking at the
number of segments.

180
00:17:48 --> 00:17:54
So, what this part of the process
does is it explains why the system

181
00:17:54 --> 00:18:00
can be has the diversity it has,
because it's using this

182
00:18:00 --> 00:18:04
combinatorial process.
If you know the number you can

183
00:18:04 --> 00:18:08
calculate how many possible
combinations there are.

184
00:18:08 --> 00:18:12
But then there's much more
variation because when it joins

185
00:18:12 --> 00:18:16
together a little segments that are
joined are done in a sloppy way so

186
00:18:16 --> 00:18:20
that the DNA sequence that shows up
where the joints occur doesn't look

187
00:18:20 --> 00:18:24
like anything that was in the DNA at
all.  It was something like a

188
00:18:24 --> 00:18:28
polymerase that wasn't very faithful
copying and making mistakes

189
00:18:28 --> 00:18:31
as it went along.
So what the system does,

190
00:18:31 --> 00:18:35
is it doesn't get you a response.
It just explains why there is so

191
00:18:35 --> 00:18:39
much diversity,
and why it is that I can go into the

192
00:18:39 --> 00:18:43
lab and synthesize a compound that's
never been on this earth before,

193
00:18:43 --> 00:18:47
inject a rabbit to it, and the
rabbit will probably produce an

194
00:18:47 --> 00:18:51
antibody that's able to recognize
that.  That's because it's made this

195
00:18:51 --> 00:18:55
whole set of them.
And they all are going to have

196
00:18:55 --> 00:18:59
somewhat different surfaces.
And they make so many that one of

197
00:18:59 --> 00:19:03
those surfaces is going to fit the
molecule that I'm testing.

198
00:19:03 --> 00:19:07
You can sort of see,
that's only part of the trick.

199
00:19:07 --> 00:19:11
So, how do you now get an immune
response?  Because you've got

200
00:19:11 --> 00:19:15
millions of these things.
But what you now need is a whole

201
00:19:15 --> 00:19:20
lot of one particular antibody
that's going to recognize the

202
00:19:20 --> 00:19:24
pathogen that you are being exposed
to.  And the principle of that is

203
00:19:24 --> 00:19:29
really cute.  It's a process called
clonal selection.

204
00:19:29 --> 00:19:44
And the idea is that each

205
00:19:44 --> 00:20:01
B cell displays

206
00:20:01 --> 00:20:05
a sample of its antibody on  its
surface.  So, we might think of it

207
00:20:05 --> 00:20:10
this sort of way,
that after this process is through

208
00:20:10 --> 00:20:15
we have one B cell.
Of course, these are way out of

209
00:20:15 --> 00:20:20
proportion.  The cells would be huge,
and these would be molecules.

210
00:20:20 --> 00:20:24
So, they're small.  But here would
be an antibody that can recognize

211
00:20:24 --> 00:20:29
squares, say, this one would have an
antibody that could recognize

212
00:20:29 --> 00:20:34
triangle.
This one would have an antibody that

213
00:20:34 --> 00:20:38
could recognize a semicircle and so
on, millions and millions of

214
00:20:38 --> 00:20:42
different shapes.
And these cells don't divide,

215
00:20:42 --> 00:20:46
though.  They've been made, and they
just sit there.

216
00:20:46 --> 00:20:50
And then, when you stimulate them
with an antigen,

217
00:20:50 --> 00:20:54
and I used that word the other day,
an antigen is just anything that

218
00:20:54 --> 00:20:58
will elicit an immune response.
It could be a piece of a foreign

219
00:20:58 --> 00:21:02
protein, carbohydrate,
just about anything that's a small

220
00:21:02 --> 00:21:09
molecule you've made in the lab.
But let's say we exposed now this

221
00:21:09 --> 00:21:19
individual to an antigen,
which in this case can fit into that

222
00:21:19 --> 00:21:30
receptor.  And what happens,
then, this one becomes stimulated to

223
00:21:30 --> 00:21:40
divide.
So what we have now is this B cell

224
00:21:40 --> 00:21:49
that has this antigen stuck into its
binding pocket on the sample of its

225
00:21:49 --> 00:21:59
antibody.  And then,
the cells divide and they give rise

226
00:21:59 --> 00:22:08
to two populations.
They give rise to the plasma cells,

227
00:22:08 --> 00:22:17
which are very short-lived, on the
order of a few days.

228
00:22:17 --> 00:22:26
And what these do, so they would
look like this,

229
00:22:26 --> 00:22:35
what they do is secrete antibodies
into the plasma.

230
00:22:35 --> 00:22:40
So what you end up with,
then, are a lot of these antibodies

231
00:22:40 --> 00:22:45
that have exactly the specificity
that the original sample had on the

232
00:22:45 --> 00:22:50
outside of that particular B cell.
This takes a few days.  So back

233
00:22:50 --> 00:22:55
when we were talking about the
discovery of DNA,

234
00:22:55 --> 00:23:00
I was telling you about
Streptococcus pneumonia,

235
00:23:00 --> 00:23:05
and you get infected by the
Streptococcus.

236
00:23:05 --> 00:23:09
And there would be this period of
five or six days where this person

237
00:23:09 --> 00:23:13
was very sick,
and then either they'd survive or

238
00:23:13 --> 00:23:17
they didn't survive.
If they survived, they'd been able

239
00:23:17 --> 00:23:22
to mount an immune response and make
these antibodies before they got

240
00:23:22 --> 00:23:26
killed by the bacteria.
And the reason it takes a few days

241
00:23:26 --> 00:23:30
is when you start out there could be
just one B cell that's able with an

242
00:23:30 --> 00:23:35
antibody, makes an antibody that is
capable of recognizing the capsule.

243
00:23:35 --> 00:23:39
Maybe there are a few.
Anyway, but they were very,

244
00:23:39 --> 00:23:43
very tiny number, and there were
probably a lot of bacteria.

245
00:23:43 --> 00:23:47
So what had to happen, then,
is that the original cell or small

246
00:23:47 --> 00:23:51
number of cells that could recognize
the Streptococcus had to be

247
00:23:51 --> 00:23:55
amplified.  They had to make a lot
of plasma cells that have the

248
00:23:55 --> 00:23:59
potential to make the antibody,
and then they had to secrete the

249
00:23:59 --> 00:24:03
antibody into the plasma.
And I'll tell you in just a minute

250
00:24:03 --> 00:24:08
some of the strategies that that
uses to help kill the pathogen.

251
00:24:08 --> 00:24:14
And the other population, just
before I go on there,

252
00:24:14 --> 00:24:19
are what are called memory cells.
There's not as many of these made,

253
00:24:19 --> 00:24:24
but they're very long-lived.  And so,
what they have is exactly the same

254
00:24:24 --> 00:24:30
capacity to make the same antibody,
but they're not actively dividing.

255
00:24:30 --> 00:24:37
They'll just sit there,

256
00:24:37 --> 00:24:45
float around in your bloodstream,
and then if you get a second

257
00:24:45 --> 00:24:54
exposure to the antigen,
you get a very fast and strong

258
00:24:54 --> 00:25:03
response because the selection for
finding the cells that had

259
00:25:03 --> 00:25:12
antibodies that can recognize the
antigen has already been done.

260
00:25:12 --> 00:25:15
And there's already a few of them
around, and then after you do that

261
00:25:15 --> 00:25:19
then you're able to make,
once again, the binding of the

262
00:25:19 --> 00:25:22
antigen stimulates these guys to
start dividing.

263
00:25:22 --> 00:25:26
They make a lot of plasma cells.
And going back to the principal of

264
00:25:26 --> 00:25:30
vaccination, your first response is
fairly modest.

265
00:25:30 --> 00:25:34
But if you get a second response,
what you're doing now is the memory

266
00:25:34 --> 00:25:39
cells are already there.
They have the specificity for

267
00:25:39 --> 00:25:43
recognizing the antigen in question.
And you can make a whole lot of

268
00:25:43 --> 00:25:48
them.  So, if you had chickenpox
when you were little,

269
00:25:48 --> 00:25:52
you have memory cells that know how
to recognize the chickenpox virus.

270
00:25:52 --> 00:25:57
And then when your kid gets
chickenpox like mine did,

271
00:25:57 --> 00:26:01
I didn't get sick because I had
memory cells that were able

272
00:26:01 --> 00:26:07
to recognize that.
OK, so what happens if you get an

273
00:26:07 --> 00:26:14
antibody?  How does this help the
organism, or in our case someone

274
00:26:14 --> 00:26:22
like you or me,
avoid getting sick?

275
00:26:22 --> 00:26:29
So there are a couple of strategies.
One we might think of

276
00:26:29 --> 00:26:35
is bind and block.
For example, you are a virus and you

277
00:26:35 --> 00:26:40
get covered by antibodies.
Viruses: it's exactly the same

278
00:26:40 --> 00:26:46
logic as bacteriophage,
except that instead of affecting a

279
00:26:46 --> 00:26:51
bacterial cell a virus would be
infecting one of our cells.

280
00:26:51 --> 00:26:56
And as the virus has receptors or
something, it has to recognize

281
00:26:56 --> 00:27:02
something on my cell,
in order to attach and then to

282
00:27:02 --> 00:27:08
inject its DNA.
So if we've got an antibody sitting

283
00:27:08 --> 00:27:15
here, then it can't find its way to
the host cell.

284
00:27:15 --> 00:27:22
And then, there are a couple of
other ways.  They can target for

285
00:27:22 --> 00:27:29
destruction.  And there's basically
two ways.  There's something called

286
00:27:29 --> 00:27:36
the complement system,
that if it is able to recognize,

287
00:27:36 --> 00:27:44
say, the bacterial cell and their
antibodies are sticking to the

288
00:27:44 --> 00:27:52
outside, what the complement system
does is it's able to make little

289
00:27:52 --> 00:28:00
pores in the membrane
of the pathogen.

290
00:28:00 --> 00:28:03
And I think one of the things I hope
you will remember is that one of the

291
00:28:03 --> 00:28:07
secrets of life is that we have to
keep that membrane around there.

292
00:28:07 --> 00:28:10
We have to keep all of our insides
in, and the rest of the world

293
00:28:10 --> 00:28:14
outside.  We have hydrogen ion
gradients across the membrane.

294
00:28:14 --> 00:28:18
So, if you want to kill a cell and
you, say, insert a protein that has

295
00:28:18 --> 00:28:21
a little hole and it,
and that thing sits and sticks in

296
00:28:21 --> 00:28:25
the membrane, that cell is dead.
It can't maintain an ion gradient,

297
00:28:25 --> 00:28:29
and things can leak out through the
hole.

298
00:28:29 --> 00:28:35
So that's one of the ways of killing
it.  The other ways are macrophages.

299
00:28:35 --> 00:28:42
These are a type of white blood
cell, as well,

300
00:28:42 --> 00:28:48
are very good at recognizing
bacteria that have antibodies stuck

301
00:28:48 --> 00:28:55
to the outside.
And in fact, that was the principle

302
00:28:55 --> 00:29:02
of that.  We have the Streptococcus,
and we have the capsule.

303
00:29:02 --> 00:29:06
And you may remember that little
movie I showed of a white blood cell

304
00:29:06 --> 00:29:10
that was trying to eat it,
and it couldn't get hold of the

305
00:29:10 --> 00:29:14
thing, whereas we saw another
example where a bacterium without a

306
00:29:14 --> 00:29:18
capsule, there was sort of principle
I said is that the white blood cell

307
00:29:18 --> 00:29:22
was able to recognize the bacterium
and then it pinches it off inside of

308
00:29:22 --> 00:29:26
a membrane bubble.
And I sort of said at least in

309
00:29:26 --> 00:29:30
principle that there is another
little bubble with poisons,

310
00:29:30 --> 00:29:35
and it brings it together so that
you have the bacterium and the

311
00:29:35 --> 00:29:40
poison together inside of some
intracellular compartment,

312
00:29:40 --> 00:29:45
so that macrophages know how to kill
a bacterium if they bring it inside.

313
00:29:45 --> 00:29:50
The problem in the case of
something like Streptococcus was

314
00:29:50 --> 00:29:55
being able to recognize it because
it couldn't get hold of that capsule.

315
00:29:55 --> 00:30:01
So, those antibodies that guy made
during that five day thing decorate

316
00:30:01 --> 00:30:06
the outside of the capsule because
their specificity is to recognize

317
00:30:06 --> 00:30:11
the capsule and bind to it.
But a macrophage,

318
00:30:11 --> 00:30:15
even if it couldn't get hold of the
bacterium with a capsule is able to

319
00:30:15 --> 00:30:20
ingest something that has antibodies
stuck on the outside.

320
00:30:20 --> 00:30:24
And once it gets inside,
it can kill the bacterium.

321
00:30:24 --> 00:30:29
In fact, immunologists call this
process opsinization,

322
00:30:29 --> 00:30:33
which is derived from the Greek
words for seasoning,

323
00:30:33 --> 00:30:38
like putting salt on your food.
And the idea was that when they were

324
00:30:38 --> 00:30:42
giving that word,
with these macrophages,

325
00:30:42 --> 00:30:46
which liked to eat bacteria,
they have a little seasoning that

326
00:30:46 --> 00:30:50
they have these little antibodies
decorating their outsides.

327
00:30:50 --> 00:30:54
So here you can see it least in the
humoral response how you generate a

328
00:30:54 --> 00:30:59
whole lot of diversity.
Then this principle of what's called

329
00:30:59 --> 00:31:03
clonal selection identifies a B cell
that's able to make an antibody that

330
00:31:03 --> 00:31:07
can recognize the particular
pathogen or molecule that you're

331
00:31:07 --> 00:31:12
being exposed to amplify that,
make a lot of antibodies, and then

332
00:31:12 --> 00:31:16
it can either just stick to the
pathogen like a virus and mess it up

333
00:31:16 --> 00:31:21
that way, or it can decorate it if
it's something like a bacterium,

334
00:31:21 --> 00:31:25
and then pull in a couple of other
systems that are capable of killing

335
00:31:25 --> 00:31:30
the pathogen.  I mean,
it's an absolutely amazing system.

336
00:31:30 --> 00:31:33
It sounded like science fiction when
I first heard about it.

337
00:31:33 --> 00:31:36
When I heard people talking about
it, everyone could see there was an

338
00:31:36 --> 00:31:40
information theory problem.
How do you encode all that

339
00:31:40 --> 00:31:43
information with just this amount of
DNA in a cell?

340
00:31:43 --> 00:31:47
Now we understand.
And there's even another part that

341
00:31:47 --> 00:31:50
I'm leaving out here.
But once this whole thing has been

342
00:31:50 --> 00:31:54
selected, there's another whole
round of sort of refinement where

343
00:31:54 --> 00:31:57
the cells do kind of a very kind of
localized mutagenesis one base pair

344
00:31:57 --> 00:32:01
at a time in the vicinity
of this binding pocket.

345
00:32:01 --> 00:32:07
And they're able to make,
if they're given more time and more

346
00:32:07 --> 00:32:13
exposure to the antigen,
they can make a better and better

347
00:32:13 --> 00:32:19
binding surface until you begin to
approach sort of the theoretical

348
00:32:19 --> 00:32:25
maximum.  Now,
the T cell, in this case this

349
00:32:25 --> 00:32:34
involves the cytotoxic T cells,
and they have a specific recognition

350
00:32:34 --> 00:32:47
molecule on their surface.
It's called the T cell receptor.

351
00:32:47 --> 00:33:00
And in this case, it's attached.

352
00:33:00 --> 00:33:04
So, this is the membrane of the T
cell.  And this is the cytoplasm

353
00:33:04 --> 00:33:08
down on this side.
There's a little bit of the protein

354
00:33:08 --> 00:33:12
that goes into that.
And then there's an alpha helix

355
00:33:12 --> 00:33:17
that goes through,
and then a segment that comes up

356
00:33:17 --> 00:33:21
like this.  And there's another
chain that does the same thing.

357
00:33:21 --> 00:33:25
So, there are two segments that
span the membrane.

358
00:33:25 --> 00:33:30
This thing is anchored in the
membrane.

359
00:33:30 --> 00:33:34
And then it's essentially the same
principle as with antibodies.

360
00:33:34 --> 00:33:39
There's a variable region, and
there's a constant region.

361
00:33:39 --> 00:33:44
And to a first approximation anyway
the logic by which the cell

362
00:33:44 --> 00:33:49
generates a huge,
diverse set of T cell receptors is

363
00:33:49 --> 00:33:54
the same logic that underlies the
generation of a whole lot of

364
00:33:54 --> 00:33:59
different antibodies by taking
segments, joining them,

365
00:33:59 --> 00:34:04
picking them randomly out of column
A, column B, and then joining them

366
00:34:04 --> 00:34:09
together, sloppy joining all the
other processes to increase the pool

367
00:34:09 --> 00:34:19
of diversity.
Now, what these B cells are able to

368
00:34:19 --> 00:34:33
do, then, these T cells are able to
do is something quite remarkable.

369
00:34:33 --> 00:34:38
We have on our cells,
this is, say, one of my cells,

370
00:34:38 --> 00:34:43
little sort of proteins that
function as sort of display cases or

371
00:34:43 --> 00:34:48
something.  And what they do is they
show samples of all of the different

372
00:34:48 --> 00:34:53
proteins that are inside us at any
given moment.  Proteins are turned

373
00:34:53 --> 00:34:59
over, and chopped up,
and things are recycled and so on.

374
00:34:59 --> 00:35:07
So there are always little peptides,
little pieces of proteins around.

375
00:35:07 --> 00:35:16
And, the display case,
if you will, has got a major

376
00:35:16 --> 00:35:25
histocompatibility complex,
which is usually abbreviated as MHC

377
00:35:25 --> 00:35:32
because it's such an unwieldy name.
And there are many,

378
00:35:32 --> 00:35:36
many alleles of MHC in the
population, which means that we each

379
00:35:36 --> 00:35:40
have, for the most part,
a sort of individually designed

380
00:35:40 --> 00:35:44
display case for showing these
peptides.  The property of these

381
00:35:44 --> 00:35:49
display cases,
they take some little piece of a

382
00:35:49 --> 00:35:53
protein just a few amino acids long,
it binds into the display case, and

383
00:35:53 --> 00:35:57
that sticks on the outside of our
cell.  And so we have

384
00:35:57 --> 00:36:02
a lot of these.
And so on the surface of our cells

385
00:36:02 --> 00:36:07
are these little individualized MHC
display cases showing little samples

386
00:36:07 --> 00:36:12
of the peptides of the proteins from
the proteins that are inside us.

387
00:36:12 --> 00:36:17
So, if everything is fine, all of
the peptides that are in the display

388
00:36:17 --> 00:36:22
cases are our own.
And I'll tell you in a minute why

389
00:36:22 --> 00:36:27
that doesn't cause a problem.
But then if you get infected by a

390
00:36:27 --> 00:36:32
virus, and it injects DNA or its RNA
inside of you and then starts to

391
00:36:32 --> 00:36:37
replicate, now you have some virus
proteins that don't belong to you.

392
00:36:37 --> 00:36:43
They get chopped into pieces,
and they begin to appear on these

393
00:36:43 --> 00:36:49
major histocompatibility display
cases.  So if you think here,

394
00:36:49 --> 00:36:56
this could be, perhaps, a little
piece of, let's call it self protein,

395
00:36:56 --> 00:37:02
it could be a little piece of my own
DNA polymerase or something

396
00:37:02 --> 00:37:09
like that.
And over in this one,

397
00:37:09 --> 00:37:17
let's say we have a little piece of
a viral protein.

398
00:37:17 --> 00:37:25
So that's something that would not
be normally there.

399
00:37:25 --> 00:37:33
So what this T-cell receptor does
is it recognizes, so this

400
00:37:33 --> 00:37:40
is non-self or foreign.
What the T-cell receptor does is it

401
00:37:40 --> 00:37:46
recognizes these foreign peptides.
But it does it in the context of

402
00:37:46 --> 00:37:53
the display case.
Otherwise the peptides would be

403
00:37:53 --> 00:37:59
floating around.
So, in essence, the T-cell receptor,

404
00:37:59 --> 00:38:06
if this is a cytotoxic T cell it's
able to see the individual display

405
00:38:06 --> 00:38:13
case with a bit of viral
protein in it.

406
00:38:13 --> 00:38:17
And then it knows that it should
kill that cell because it's got

407
00:38:17 --> 00:38:21
something in it that shouldn't be
there.  I mean,

408
00:38:21 --> 00:38:25
it's a brutal but very effective
strategy.  If we applied it here,

409
00:38:25 --> 00:38:29
I go around if I found any of you
had a cold, I could just take a gun

410
00:38:29 --> 00:38:33
and shoot you and it would cut down
on the number of sick days for the

411
00:38:33 --> 00:38:38
rest of us because it wouldn't
spread the infection.

412
00:38:38 --> 00:38:42
But in essence,
at a molecular level,

413
00:38:42 --> 00:38:46
that's the strategy.  Try to
identify a cell that's got something

414
00:38:46 --> 00:38:50
inside it that shouldn't be there,
and then the cytotoxic T cells kill

415
00:38:50 --> 00:38:54
that.  And let me just show you a
couple of quick movies of this.

416
00:38:54 --> 00:38:58
At this point, these will be the
last protein structures you're going

417
00:38:58 --> 00:39:03
to see from me, I think.
Here's a representation of that T

418
00:39:03 --> 00:39:07
cell just as a cartoon as you see it
in a textbook.

419
00:39:07 --> 00:39:11
Here it is.  This is the binding
pocket up here.

420
00:39:11 --> 00:39:15
And there's a little tiny peptide,
nine and amino acids from the HIV

421
00:39:15 --> 00:39:19
virus bound in here.
Somebody did a crystal structure,

422
00:39:19 --> 00:39:23
and was able to work that out.  And,
if you look at it in three

423
00:39:23 --> 00:39:27
dimensions, you'll see how
beautifully this little binding

424
00:39:27 --> 00:39:31
pocket and the peptide
lies in there.

425
00:39:31 --> 00:39:35
So that red part is the piece of
chalk, and the other part is what

426
00:39:35 --> 00:39:39
I'm describing as my hand.
It's not a bad analogy, actually,

427
00:39:39 --> 00:39:44
even on a structural level.  And
then, here's another representation.

428
00:39:44 --> 00:39:48
This is sort of showing the hand
with a piece of peptide in it.

429
00:39:48 --> 00:39:53
And then the T cell is able to see
this whole thing in recognize it.

430
00:39:53 --> 00:39:57
And, if you look at it in a
structural form, here's

431
00:39:57 --> 00:40:02
the little peptide.
This is the part,

432
00:40:02 --> 00:40:07
the display case you're looking at.
And here's the T cell receptor now

433
00:40:07 --> 00:40:11
fitting down in seeing the peptide
in the context of this major

434
00:40:11 --> 00:40:16
histocompatibility antigen.
And again, these things are all

435
00:40:16 --> 00:40:21
beautifully complementary a three
dimensional level.

436
00:40:21 --> 00:40:26
Again, at the heart of this is the
principle of complementary surfaces

437
00:40:26 --> 00:40:31
fitting together that underlies so
much biology.  What's this?

438
00:40:31 --> 00:40:36
This is a tumor cell.
These are cytotoxic T cells that

439
00:40:36 --> 00:40:41
have recognized this tumor cell is
doing something it shouldn't that a

440
00:40:41 --> 00:40:46
normal cell wouldn't do.
And it's attacking it, and it's

441
00:40:46 --> 00:40:52
killing them.  So,
not only does the cellular immune

442
00:40:52 --> 00:40:57
response help us against things like
infections from virus and bacteria,

443
00:40:57 --> 00:41:03
it also will help prevent cancer.
So obviously there must be some

444
00:41:03 --> 00:41:10
trick here to why we don't see our
own peptides.  This is the self

445
00:41:10 --> 00:41:17
versus non-self  And it's a
relatively simple principle.

446
00:41:17 --> 00:41:24
So, distinguishing self versus
non-self is a problem throughout

447
00:41:24 --> 00:41:32
this whole part of the
immune system.

448
00:41:32 --> 00:41:41
And here's the principle.
During embryogenesis, the cell

449
00:41:41 --> 00:41:50
makes, the organism I guess,
makes the assumption.  I mean

450
00:41:50 --> 00:42:00
obviously it's not thinking
about it.

451
00:42:00 --> 00:42:10
This is a way of understanding
what's happening.

452
00:42:10 --> 00:42:20
It makes the assumption that no
pathogens are present.

453
00:42:20 --> 00:42:36
Any B or T cell recognizing
something must be recognizing itself.

454
00:42:36 --> 00:42:52
And so, it deletes those B and T
cells.  This process is given a name.

455
00:42:52 --> 00:43:05
It's called education.
And it happens in this organ called

456
00:43:05 --> 00:43:16
thymus.  So, and then after birth,
then it switches.  And now B and T

457
00:43:16 --> 00:43:28
cells, if they recognize something,
the body makes the assumption it

458
00:43:28 --> 00:43:36
must be a pathogen.
And it goes after it.

459
00:43:36 --> 00:43:41
We have this huge human disease
where that goes awry: rheumatoid

460
00:43:41 --> 00:43:45
arthritis, or multiple sclerosis are
cases where the self versus non-self

461
00:43:45 --> 00:43:50
recognition has broken down.
OK, so for example multiple

462
00:43:50 --> 00:43:55
sclerosis, a very difficult disease,
because there's a gradual

463
00:43:55 --> 00:44:00
deterioration of the
nervous system.

464
00:44:00 --> 00:44:04
And what happens is the body of the
person with that mounts an immune

465
00:44:04 --> 00:44:08
response against the sheath that
covers the nerves,

466
00:44:08 --> 00:44:12
and then that sheath gets destroyed,
and that the nervous system,

467
00:44:12 --> 00:44:16
somebody with multiple sclerosis,
starts to break down.  And so, if

468
00:44:16 --> 00:44:20
you lose this self versus non-self
you get what's called an autoimmune

469
00:44:20 --> 00:44:24
disease.  You may have heard that
phrase.  It's very important.

470
00:44:24 --> 00:44:28
It's a very tough thing if you have
one of these.  But that's what lies

471
00:44:28 --> 00:44:31
at the heart of it.
And people still don't know,

472
00:44:31 --> 00:44:35
but there is certainly some evidence
for some of these that are triggered

473
00:44:35 --> 00:44:39
by a bacterial infection.
So, it could be that perhaps maybe

474
00:44:39 --> 00:44:43
a bacterial protein looked close
enough to one of your own proteins,

475
00:44:43 --> 00:44:47
that somehow you got antibodies
against the bacterium,

476
00:44:47 --> 00:44:50
and then it turned out it could also
recognize something in your body.

477
00:44:50 --> 00:44:54
There are some other immune
diseases you probably heard of,

478
00:44:54 --> 00:44:58
the baby in a bubble kind of thing.
There are a few people who were

479
00:44:58 --> 00:45:02
born who have no immune response at
all because one of the basic pieces

480
00:45:02 --> 00:45:06
for doing those DNA gymnastics I
talked about isn't there.

481
00:45:06 --> 00:45:10
Those people have no B cells or T
cells.  They die unless they are

482
00:45:10 --> 00:45:14
absolutely shielded from everything
else.  And that's one of those cases

483
00:45:14 --> 00:45:18
when gene therapy,
if you could get that gene into that

484
00:45:18 --> 00:45:23
person, they'd have an immune system
and they could live.

485
00:45:23 --> 00:45:27
There are other kinds of immune
deficiencies that are less extreme,

486
00:45:27 --> 00:45:32
but nevertheless, people will be
susceptible to infection.

487
00:45:32 --> 00:45:36
The other one which I've already
talked about, but now you can see in

488
00:45:36 --> 00:45:40
another context is AIDS,
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.

489
00:45:40 --> 00:45:44
And I told you what the HIV virus
does is it injects its RNA.

490
00:45:44 --> 00:45:48
That makes a DNA copy.  It goes
into protein.  The cells that it

491
00:45:48 --> 00:45:52
affects our special type of T cell
called T helper cells.

492
00:45:52 --> 00:45:56
What they are doesn't matter so
much, but what's important to know

493
00:45:56 --> 00:46:00
is they're needed for both branches
of the immune system.

494
00:46:00 --> 00:46:04
They play roles in the humoral
response and cellular response.

495
00:46:04 --> 00:46:08
So, someone who gets infected with
HIV, what happens is the virus is

496
00:46:08 --> 00:46:12
replicating in these helper T cells.
And so their immune system is

497
00:46:12 --> 00:46:16
slowly, slowly being knocked away.
And the last thing, which I won't

498
00:46:16 --> 00:46:20
have time to talk about,
but if you have an allergy,

499
00:46:20 --> 00:46:24
that's an overreaction of the immune
system.  So this is my last lecture.

500
00:46:24 --> 00:46:28
I've got to let you guys go.  It's
been a true pleasure to talk to you;

501
00:46:28 --> 00:46:32
A real honor to meet many of you.
And many of you put a lot of effort

502
00:46:32 --> 00:46:36
into those little answers.
I really, really appreciate that.

503
00:46:36 --> 00:46:41
For those who'd rather not be here,
I hope that somewhere down the line

504
00:46:41 --> 00:46:46
when you're confronted with a
medical situation dealing with your

505
00:46:46 --> 00:46:50
parents, your child,
yourself, whatever it is,

506
00:46:50 --> 00:46:55
that some of the stuff that you
heard will reemerge to help you with

507
00:46:55 --> 00:47:00
those decisions.
And I wish you the best of luck for

508
00:47:00 --> 00:47:04
the rest of the course,
and the rest of your careers at MIT

509
00:47:04 --> 00:47:09
and beyond.  Thanks very much.
And as I leave,

510
00:47:09 --> 00:47:13
too, I've had the pleasure of just
having an incredible teaching staff.

511
00:47:13 --> 00:47:18
I don't think you guys know how
hard they work behind the scenes,

512
00:47:18 --> 00:47:21
but thanks to all of you for being
with me.
