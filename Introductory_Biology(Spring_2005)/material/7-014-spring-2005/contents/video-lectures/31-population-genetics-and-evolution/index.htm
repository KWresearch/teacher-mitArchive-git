<p></p>
<p>So, for today's lecture as you can see up there is molecular --  evolution, and ecology. And what I mean by this, it's basically the  study or what we try to figure out in molecular evolution and ecology is  what genes or gene sequences can tell us about the evolution and  ultimately also the ecology of organisms in the environment. And it's  particularly relevant for thinking about microorganisms, prokaryotes and  the environment. And I hope I can actually convince you today of that.  This is interesting. The topics that I want to cover today is, first of  all, I want to review a little bit what we know about life on Earth,  sort of give an overview of the evolution of life on Earth. Then, I want  to go into specific topic that's of particular relevance for the  evolution of eukaryotes.</p>
<p>That's the endosymbiosis theory. And then  I'll explain how we can use gene sequences to actually reconstruct  events that have happened a very, very long time ago. OK, so we'll look  at what we call molecular phylogenies, with the use of gene sequences to  reconstruct the evolutionary history of organisms on Earth. Derived  from that, we'll look at what we call the tree of life. That's sort of  the big picture overview of the evolutionary relationships of all  organisms on the planet. And then finally, I'll introduce you to a topic  called molecular ecology. Again, that's how we can use gene sequences  to learn something about the diversity of microorganisms in the  environment that lead us then, next time, when I come back on Monday,  into this big topic of environmental genomics, how we can actually  expand this analysis to learn much more about organisms in the  environment.</p>
<p>So, first of all, let's look at life on Earth. Does  anybody know how old we think Earth is? Say again? Yeah, 4.5 to 4.6, I  haven't my notes 4.6. So, Earth's thought to have originated about 4.6  billion years ago. When did the first solid rocks appear on earth? So,  when was the surface kind of solidified? Anybody know? About 3.</p>
<p>9  billion years ago, OK? And when do we think life started to develop on  the planet? Any ideas? Take a guess. Two? One? 3.5 billion years ago,  OK? So, this is really remarkable. We think it didn't, I mean, of course  it took a long time because were talking about millions of years and  hundreds of millions of years, but still, if you look at the big  picture, it didn't actually take life that long to evolve on the planet.  So, why do we think that is the case? What's the evidence for that?  Well, we look into sedimentary rocks, so old rocks that arose from  sediments, what you find around this time, you find that chemicals start  to appear, organic molecules that really resemble organic molecules in  modern life. So, we have sort of chemical tracers, or chemical fossils.</p>
<p>So,  tracers that indicate the presence of organisms. But what we also find  is so-called micro-fossils, and I have a picture of that here where when  you actually take rocks and actually slice them into very, very then  slices, you can put them under specific microscopes. And what you then  find is that many rocks that are very, very old, have those kinds of  inclusions in them. And these things really resemble very much modern  prokaryotic cells, modern bacterial cells, for example. And so, those  micro-fossils are generally taken as an indication, also, that life is  already present during those times. Now, when we take a quick sort of  overlook of the evolution of life on the planet, again this graph here  summarizes sort of the last 4.</p>
<p>6 billion years or so when life  originated. We see that there was a period of chemical evolution, and  then somewhere here that region, it's, of course, not really well  understood when that exactly happens, the origin of life is placed. But I  want to alert you to a couple of really, really critical steps here  that are shown on this graph which we'll actually talk more about. It is  thought that life very early on is split into three major lineages: the  bacteria, the archaea, in what is called here nuclear line. And I'll  come back to that in a minute or so. Then, a further major event which  you may remember is oxygenic photosynthesis actually evolved -- -- which  means that cyanobacteria evolved that started to produce oxygen as a  byproduct of photosynthesis.</p>
<p>And that really fundamentally changed  the chemistry of the Earth. It actually became an oxidizing atmosphere.  And what you see here is, once the oxygen concentration goes over a  certain level, it allowed the development of an ozone shield. Now, what  does that mean? What was the critical significance of the presence of an  ozone shield? Does anybody know? What does it block out? Anybody  remember that? What's the big significance of the ozone hole over  Antarctica for example? It allows UV radiation to heat the Earth's  surface, and in fact if there were no ozone, the UV radiation would be  so strong that there would be no life possible on land. So, once the  ozone shield actually developed, organisms could conquer, basically, the  land's surface and settle on the land surface.</p>
<p>In this, then, is  thought to be at least correlated with the development of endosymbiosis.  And I'll explain what I mean by that. But it basically led to the  origin of modern eukaryotes, so your ancestors essentially. But there  was still a long time, obviously, until humans appeared. We have here  the origin of animals and metazoans, and then the age of the dinosaurs  is already a very small blip here on this graph.</p>
<p>And humans don't  even get featured on that because we are so recent. So, but what I want  to show you here is that three major lineages evolved early on. These  are the bacteria, archaea, and what we call a nuclear lineage. And the  significance of those nuclear lineages is that it basically combined  with bacteria to form the modern eukaryotic cell. So, the eukarya, or  eukaryotes they're also called. And it was this combination that we  called the endosymbiosis event.</p>
<p>I want to explain this a little  bit more, and then I'll show you finally why we actually know that those  things are very likely to have occurred a long time ago. Yes? It means  the bacteria and the nuclear lineages combine to form a eukaryote, OK?  And I'm actually going to explain this on the slide here. So, if you  have any more questions after that, please let me know. So, again, this  shows you this early evolution, this early split in two archaea,  bacteria, and this sort of nuclear line.</p>
<p>It is thought that this  nuclear line, this was single celled organisms that increased in cell  size, and then developed or partitioned the DNA into a nucleus,  basically. So exactly how you find it in modern eukaryotic cells. But  then what happened is the cell took up a bacterial cell, and over time  this bacterial cell became symbiont. In fact it became the mitochondria.  And so what this mitochondria now does in the moderate eukaryotic cell  as you all know is it really took over the energy metabolism. So, the  proto-eukaryotic cell took up a heterotrophic bacteria that form the  mitochondria. And this ultimately then gave rise to protozoa and to  modern-day animals.</p>
<p>But there was a secondary symbiotic event.  This cell, once it had taken up a heterotrophic bacterium, it took up an  autotrophic bacterium, a cyanobacterium, an oxygenic photosynthesizer.  And this actually that led to the development of modern algae and modern  plants. So what we can say is that mitochondria our ancient  heterotrophic bacteria -- And the chloroplasts are ancient  cyanobacteria, so, oxygenic, photosynthetic bacteria.</p>
<p>And these  obviously have coevolved to then form animals and finally your plants.  So now, obviously we are talking here about events that happened a very,  very long time ago. And so, the big question is really how do we really  know this? But this takes me to the third topic, which is that of  molecular evolution. So, we can state the problem again, And that is  very simply put, evolution is incredibly slow, OK? And therefore, its  processes are not directly observable.</p>
<p>And we need to actually use  inference techniques to reconstruct evolutionary processes. Now, what  do we use when we want to reconstruct the evolutionary history of  animals and plants usually? Anybody? Fossils. Exactly. So you take a  shovel, essentially, and dig down into the different layers. And there's  different techniques that you can actually determine the age of  different sedentary rocks. For example, and then you can construct, if  you're lucky, you'll find enough fossils of a particular lineage.</p>
<p>You  can reconstruct the evolution of the lineage. I'm sure you all have  seen the example of the horse, for example, where we have actually quite  good evidence when ancient horses look like. And we can reconstruct the  sequence of events that led to the evolution of modern-day horses. Now,  you can imagine, though, that when we talk about such ancient events  like these there really is no fossil record.</p>
<p>OK, so what people  have figured out, then, is that that was really a stroke of genius that  came about in the late 60s, that DNA molecules can act as evolutionary  chronometers. OK, now what do I mean by that? I mean that you can take  DNA sequences or gene sequences from different kinds of organisms. Based  on those gene sequences you can reconstruct the relationships to each  other. You can determine whether two organisms are closely related or  whether they are only very distantly related. And the underlying  mechanism of that, is that mutations happen with a certain probability  all the time.</p>
<p>So, the idea is that as time passed on, DNA  molecules will change. So they will accumulate, actually, mutations, and  so this will lead to, and that the idea is that the amount of change in  a particular DNA sequence is proportional to the time of separate  evolution of two different lineages or two different organisms. So, the  amount is more or less proportional -- -- to time since the last common  ancestry.</p>
<p>So, let me explain how this is actually done. What you  really need in order to do this, is you need genes that are related to  each other, OK? So, genes, they need to be universally distributed. That  meets all organisms that you want to compare need to have this type of  gene. And, those genes need to have conserved function. In these genes,  we can then compare to each other, and I will explain how this is  actually done. Any questions so far? OK, so the example that I actually  want to bring is the 16S ribosomal RNA genes.</p>
<p>We oftentimes  abbreviate this rRNA. Now, does anybody remember what the ribosomal RNAs  are and do? What's the ribosome? Yes? Right, and what does it do?  Exactly, it's the location where messenger RNA is translated into  protein. Now, the ribosomal RNAs are an integral part of the ribosome.  They play both a catalytic role as well as a structural role in the  ribosome. And so, fundamentally, because this is such a fundamental  organelle, all living organisms possess it. So, all organisms have it.  So this allows us to use these genes to really compare all living  organisms to each other. OK, so this is a very important point. I wanted  to show you a, OK, if it wakes up.</p>
<p>There we go. An example of  these ribosomal RNA genes, now this is actually, what you see here is a  secondary structure of the actual RNA, the ribosomal RNA. Now, these  molecules have a secondary structure because they play a catalytic and  structural role. And so, the really amazing thing is when you look at  the structure, the structure determines really the function of those  molecules in different organisms. And then look at this.</p>
<p>We have  here a bacterium, and here are an archaea. Now, if you think back to the  first couple of slides, what I showed you is that those organisms have  not shared a common evolutionary history for about four, or so, billion  years, or 3 billion years, excuse me. But, if you just glance very  quickly at the structures, you see that they look very similar to each  other. So, there's an indication that the function is really very highly  conserved of those molecules.</p>
<p>However, when you actually look at  the sequences in detail, what you'll find is that there's different  regions. And I'd given some examples here denoted by A, B, C in those  molecules. And these different regions of the molecules are really the  key to its usefulness in figuring out the evolution and ecology of many  organisms. The region number A here, or denoted by A, a sequence  stretches that are the same in all living organisms.</p>
<p>So they are  universally conserved, which means that if you get a mutation in a gene  in that particular region, you are dead. OK, that's why it's conserved  essentially. Then we have those regions B where the length is conserved,  but the sequence is not. So, there are sequence change allowed, but the  length needs to be conserved. And then there's the region C were  neither length nor sequence is actually conserved, and where we get a  lot of variation. So, let me write this down. We have three types of  sequence stretches. We have A, what I called the universally conserved  sequences.</p>
<p>We have B where length, but not sequence is conserved.  And, we have C where neither length nor sequence is actually conserved.  And the first two stretches, the first two types of sequence stretches,  are very important in figuring out the phylogeny or the evolutionary  relationships amongst organisms. Whereas the sequence stretches number C  because they vary so dramatically, are very important in identifying  organisms. And we'll talk more about this actually next time.</p>
<p>So  what can we actually know do with those sequences? Well, the first step  is we need to generate an alignment. OK, and this is actually shown  here, where each row denotes a gene from a particular organism. OK, so  these are all abbreviated here. These actually aren't ribosomal RNA  genes, but other genes. And that what you will see here is we can  recognize those three different regions that I've pointed out before.  You have the regions A which tell you which nucleotides line up with  each other, so you use this sort of as an anchor because the sequences  never vary amongst organisms. And that the sequence region B where you  light up sequences that vary or stretches that vary in sequence but not  in length. Now, why is this important? It's important because you have  in each column that nucleotides that have originated from a common  ancestral nucleotide, and whose variation over time you can actually  monitor.</p>
<p>Is everybody with that? Any questions? OK, great. The  second step, then, is the calculation of a similarity. And this is shown  here. Again, we have a very simplified alignment now of four different  organisms. Here, we have the sequences that we want to compare. And what  you'll see is that they're overall very similar, but there are  different sort of nucleotides. And so, what we simply do is for each  pair of sequence combinations, we calculate the sequence similarity  value.</p>
<p>So, what you see is that you have 12 nucleotides, and the  first pair differs in three nucleotides. OK, so that tells us, or it's  called actually a distance here, I'm sorry. Let me write this down here.  It's simply one minus the similarity, of course, but so basically a  quarter of the nucleotides differ where it's between A and C, a third of  the nucleotides difference on. OK, so you do this for each pair of  sequences, excuse me. The third step, then, is to calculate the  correction for multiple mutations affecting the same nucleotides.</p>
<p>Now,  you can imagine that over time there's a probability that a particular  nucleotide mutates, say, twice. So, in the first instance it may change  from A to a G, , but then it changes to a C. But when you look at the  modern-day sequences, you don't know that this actually happened. And so  there's ways to statistically estimate what the likelihood is that a  sequence actually contains such multiple events. OK, and this, we  called, a corrective evolutionary distance then.</p>
<p>And what you will  note is that the corrected evolutionary distance is invariably larger  than the actual observed one. Now, what can we can do with those  distances? We can constrain them into a best fit tree of relationships.  So, we can draw what we call is a best fit tree. That's shown here. We  have our four organisms, but when you look at those branches of the tree  what you'll see is that they add up roughly to the correct evolutionary  distance here. So, between A and B we have 0.</p>
<p>23 and 0.08, which  roughly gives you 0.3 here, OK, whereas between A and C the tree is  constrain such that we have 0.31, and here 0.15, and so overall you  roughly get the distance here that we have calculated. And so what this  means is that you ordered the organisms by their calculated evolutionary  distance. And so you have now obtained, actually, a very intuitive  picture of the relationship of organisms to each other where A and B are  obviously the most closely related ones, and A and D are the most  distantly related. Is everybody with it? Any questions? OK, now, this  best fit tree is what we call a phylogeny.</p>
<p>Now, excuse me, these  techniques really revolutionized the study of evolutionary  relationships, and one of the things that it allowed us to do is to  construct universal phylogenetic trees or what we can also call the tree  of life. And I will show you this on the next slide, and that I want to  make a few general statements about this. So first of all, when you  analyze all known organisms, and obviously that would be a big task, but  representative of all known organisms, what you'll find is that,  indeed, we have three major lineages: the bacteria, the archaea, and the  eukarya.</p>
<p>OK, so we have what we call three domains of life: the  archaea, bacteria, and the eukarya. So, this really is the evidence that  life really split very, very early on into those three lineages that I  showed you before. Interestingly, two of those major domains here are  prokaryotic, OK? So, two of the domains are prokaryotes.</p>
<p>Moreover,  if you actually look at the types of organisms that are on here, you'll  notice that even on the eukaryotic side of the tree, most of the  organisms here are actually microbial. So, the single celled organisms:  and that means that most of the life on the planet is microbial. The  vast diversity of organisms on the planet are microorganisms. So, we can  say that most life is microbial. And when you, then, look at analysis  of mitochondria, and chloroplasts which all have their own genetic  machinery, and therefore also their own ribosomes you'll see that the  mitochondrion, OK, and the chloroplasts both tree within the bacteria.</p>
<p>So,  we really have an amazing confirmation of this endosymbiont theory  which actually developed in the absence of gene sequences by some  Russian scientists in the early 20th century. So, we have that  mitochondria and chloroplasts tree within bacteria, and this really  supports the endosymbiont theory.</p>
<p>So really, you could say  eukaryotes are really just walking, and swimming, and flying incubators  for bacteria, right? So, just hosts for microorganisms. OK, so basically  you can, what you should take home from this is the three domains of  life. Two are prokaryotic, and even more so most of the diversity that  we find is actually microbial, and then finally the endosymbiont theory  is actually confirmed by those phylogenies. Now, what I want to cover in  the remaining time, is how we can actually use now those sequences to  learn something about organisms in the environment.</p>
<p>That's the  topic of molecular ecology. To introduce this, I just want to show you a  couple slides that really sort of capture what the big problem is that  we're facing here. Now, when we look at the abundance of prokaryotic  cells in different types of environments, what we see is that there is  an enormous number of different prokaryotes out there. This summarizes,  here, different types of environments.</p>
<p>We have the marine  environment, freshwater environment, sediment and soils, subsurface  sentiments and animal guts. And that this number here gives you the  average number of prokaryotic cells either per milliliter or per gram.  And it here we have the total number of cells obtained by multiplying  the average number with the total volume of the particular environment.  So what you can see is that in the marine environment, we have an  average half a million cells per milliliter of water, OK? It freshwater,  we have about a million cells.</p>
<p>What is that telling you? There's a  ton of prokaryotes out there. What you go swimming, you take a little  gulp of water: you've probably eaten several million prokaryotes, that  it's nothing to worry about because what this also tells us is that  very, very few prokaryotes out there are really pathogens because  otherwise you'd be sick all the time. Now, in sediments and soils, in as  little as a gram you have five times 10^9 prokaryotic cells almost.</p>
<p>5  billion prokaryotic cells are out there, and even in very, very deep  sediments that reach down to 3,000 m, you have a substantial number of  prokaryotic cells. Well, and here's your guts, 10^5 times 10^6 gives you  10^11 per gram. So again, you're just a walking incubator for a very  complex microbial community. Here's the global abundance. You see that  steeps of surface sediments and the marine environment, probably in  terms of numbers at least, the most important microbial environments.  Now, faced with this enormous abundance of prokaryotes out there, very  important question is how many of them are out there? Or, how diverse  our prokaryotes in the environment? That's important if you want to  figure out their function and the environment, and want to understand  also their evolution.</p>
<p>And what I want to show you here is that  we've gone through an amazing development in our understanding of  prokaryotic diversity in the environment over the last 10 to 15 years or  so. Who knows about E.</p>
<p>O. Wilson here? One person? So, he wrote a  very famous book on biodiversity, which was published in 1988, where he  tried to summarize, really, how diverse the known organisms are on the  planet it also try to extrapolate to the total diversity. And what you  see is that he came up with about 1.4 million different species here,  mostly dominated by insects. That's the big section here on this pie  chart. The plants: very important. And if you look, the prokaryotes  feature with about 3,500 different species. So, in 1988 we thought there  were very few prokaryotic species out there. If you look about 10 years  into the future and take the assessment here, and this just exemplifies  how the thinking has changed, you see that we think now that there is  about 11 million different species out there, and that the vast majority  of them are prokaryotic, OK, 10 million.</p>
<p>So, this big part of the  pie chart is really the prokaryotic diversity. Now, what really has  changed is that we've actually started to use molecular techniques to  determine the diversity of prokaryotes in the environment. So molecular  ecology is really the use of molecular gene sequences obtained directly  from the environment -- -- to learn about the diversity prokaryotic --  -- diversity out there.</p>
<p>Now, this slide just quickly summarizes  this. Basically, the idea is that you go out into the environment and  collect either water or soil samples that, as I just showed you,  invariably contain a lot of different prokaryotic cells. You then lyse  the cells and purify their DNA. And so that you end up with a mixture of  DNA that represents the organisms out there, and then you can use  universal PCR primers to actually amplify ribosomal RNA genes from all  the organisms that are present in your samples. Now, why can you use  universal PCR primers? Well, they target the regions number A that I  showed you before.</p>
<p>Those regions in the genes are invariant  amongst all organisms. You guys all remember how the PCR works, right?  We cover this. OK? Yes? No? Who doesn't? You don't? All right, come to  the board. Just kidding. OK, you should look it up. I don't have time to  cover this, unfortunately, but basically it's a technique that allows  you to amplify specific types of genes millions to billion fold. And  once you have done this, what you can do is that you can purify the  genes on gels, and then separate them by cloning them into individual  plasmids. And those plasmids have been inserted into E.</p>
<p>coli  cells, and the E. coli cells are then individually grown up so that each  culture contains only a single plasmid, and you can then sequence these  ribosomal DNAs or ribosomal RNA genes from those clones. And so, you  have obtained a library of the ribosomal RNA genes from the environment.  So, we use environmental ribosomal RNA gene libraries from which we  then can actually compare how many different types of genes are out  there. So let me show you an example of this.</p>
<p>What we have done  recently, we've gone out in one of the first really comprehensive  samplings of coastal bacteria plankton, which means the bacteria that  are present free living in ocean water. And so, we've done this, we've  collected all those clones, and then basically we constructed those  phylogenetic trees that I showed you before that really allow us see how  many different types are out there, and how closely related they are to  one another. And what we found is that in this environment that you  think might be very simple because it just the water column right? No,  not much structure in there.</p>
<p>We found over 1500 bacterial 16S  ribosomal RNA sequences to occur, so an enormous diversity of  prokaryotes of bacteria in that particular environment. And the  important point is that when you actually look at a collection of such  studies that I just showed you, what you find is that the vast majority  of microorganisms in the environment have never been cultured. So  traditionally what we do of course to learn about microorganisms when  you grow E. coli, or so, you throw them onto culture plates. You make  lots of different cells, and that allows you to study some of their  properties. But when you look, for example, at results from the ocean,  this summarizes now coastal and open ocean environments, again, the  bacteria plankton is those free-floating bacterial cells in the water.  And you compare this to what we've actually been able to culture from  those environments.</p>
<p>What you see is that you have some dominant  groups here. They have all funny names, most of them, because they're  just clones and clone libraries. But these are the dominant groups that  show up in clone libraries. Here's their relative representation in  different clone libraries from a variety of environments. And so here  you have one very important one, the SAR11 group, or this one, the  SAR86, that always show up in clone libraries. But we've never see them  in culture, so the important point to realize here is that what is  actually happening is that whenever we go out, we find a great diversity  of bacteria out there, but we have no idea what they actually do. And  this is one of the big questions that we need to answer to understand,  really, how the planet actually works.</p>
<p>What are those uncultured  microorganisms out in the environment really doing, and what is their  importance? And we'll talk about this next time. We're going to talk  about environmental genomics because essentially what we can do now, is  we have techniques available that allow us to isolate and least large  fragments of the genomes, sequence those, and look at what kinds of  genes they have present. And that allows us, then, to infer some of  their function in the biogeochemical cycles in the environment.</p>
<p>OK, so with this I'm going to close today unless you have any more questions.</p>
