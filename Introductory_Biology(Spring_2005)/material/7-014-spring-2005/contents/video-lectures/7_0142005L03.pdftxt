Transcript â€“ Lecture 3 

So our next class of b iomolecule that we're going to ta lk about are nucleic acids. And 
we can, for the most part, describe their properties by considering just cova lent 
bonds and hydrogen bonds. Although, that's a b it of an oversimp lification. But, 
anyway, these are, again, polymers. So this is DNA and RNA, terms you've 
undoubtedly heard. And these are made by sp litting out water. And, in this case,  the 
monomeric units are given the specia l term nucleotide. 

And a nucleotide consists of a sugar w ith something ca lled a base on it. It's got a 
phosphate group at one end and a hydroxyl group, one of the sugar hydroxyls that 
we saw the other day at the other end. The B stands for base. And the way the bond 
is formed, as I said, is by splitting out water like that to  form what's known as a 
phosphodiester bond. And we'll be talking a lot about those when we ta lk about DNA 
and RNA in more detail later on in the course. 

The sugars are pentoses where N equa ls 5. We were talking about these the other 
day. The base goes in this position. That's the 1 position of the carbon. This is the 5 
position of the carbon. And this is where the phosphate is located. This sugar is 
called  ribose. And then RNA, which is the polymer of nucleotides that have ribose as 
the sugar is ribonucleic acid or RNA, as you've known it. 

If this hydroxyl here is replaced by a hydrogen and the rest of it's the same -- -- this 
is deoxyribonucleoside. And if you polymerize that together then you get DNA or 
deoxyribonucleic acid. The bases come in two flavors. And this w ill be on your 
handout. Ones that either have two rings, adenine or guanine. And  the genera l term 
of those is purine or they have one ring of pyrimidine. And in DNA one finds cytid ine 
and thiamine abbreviated as C and T. 

Or in RNA, instead of find ing thiamine you find uracil, which is the same except that 
it doesn't have the methyl group that's present at this position on thiamine. And the 
important thing about these particular nucleotide bases is that they can form 
hydrogen bonds in a very special way. It's d iagramed on here that this  is a guanine 
pairing with the cytidine, so a G pairing w ith a C. 

And you can  form three hydrogen bonds. Or between an A, an adenine and a 
thiamine you can form two hydrogen bonds. Those are just the things we were 
diagramming on the board the other day. And those are the forces that hold the 
strands of DNA together so that DNA is the double helix, as you know. It's basica lly a 
backbone w ith sugars and phosphates. And then there'll be some sequence of bases 
down this. 

And then on the other strand you'll have the base that can  form hydrogen bonds 
with this. So C, there would be three hydrogen bonds here. This would be a G on this 
side, again, three hydrogen bonds. If there's an A here that will be a T there, two 
hydrogen bonds. And so on down. And we'll ta lk about the implications of this later in 
the course when we talk about DNA rep lication, but for the moment I think your eye 

can see, you can probably see that the geometric arrangement of these is just 
exactly the same, whether it's a G-C or it's an A-T base pa ir. 

You can superimpose them, and they have just exactly the same molecular 
structure. And that's really crucia l for a lot of things having to do w ith DNA. So, as 
you know,  it's not just sort of a ladder w ith hydrogen bonds. It's tw isted in 3-
dimensional space. That's the double helix. And  in that little movie I showed you the 
nitrogen atoms and the bases are blue so you can pretty much p ick it out that 
there's a series of hydrogen bonds going right down the middle of a DNA molecule 
with the phosphoribose backbone on the outside. 

So every one of your cells, since you have about 3 billion base pairs you have two 
point something times that many hydrogen bonds hold ing your DNA together. The 
thing to remember about the strength of the hydrogen bond, it's about a twentieth a 
covalent bond, and so you're able to pull those things apart and then put them back 
together at physiological temperature while leaving a ll the covalent bonds that make 
up each strand of the DNA leaving those intact. 

It's also possible, since RNAs are usually single-stranded, that if you have a little 
sequence here that has the complimentary sequence over there then these can pa ir 
like this forming a ha irp in or some little structure like that. And, again, we'll talk 
about transfer RNAs which p lay a  rea lly key role in protein synthesis. They're the 
little translators that go back and  forth between the nucleic acid code, the genetic 
code and the protein code, which is written in amino acids. 

And this just shows making an RNA copy for a tRNA gene from the DNA, but then 
these are the relationships between the comp limentary sequences right in that 
strand. So this thing is able to fold up into a sort of cloverleaf structure that some of 
you have certa inly probably seen at some point. It's a little b it tw isted here because 
you can see how the complimentary sequences have found each other. 

And even though this is just a sing le strand of RNA, by forming hydrogen bonds to 
complimentary sequences within itself it can take up a structure. And I'll show you. 
It actua lly goes on,  there are some other forces that come in. And this will fold up 
into a 3-d imensiona l structure that goes even beyond what I've shown you, but we 
won't need to ta lk about that for just a little bit. 

OK. So then the next -- -- class of molecules that we're going to spend a lot of this 
course on are proteins. And these are polymers again. -- made by splitting out 
water. So that's been true of polysaccharides. It's true of nucleic acids. It's true of 
proteins. In this case the monomers are structures known as amino acids. And they 
have an amino group. And then it's joined to a carbon known as the a lpha carbon. 
And then there's a carboxyl group. 

So this is why they're called amino acids, because their carboxyl group is an acid. 
And the way they form -- We'll give these d ifferent side chains here. I'll tell you 
about these side cha ins in just a minute. The way these form a bond is by splitting 
out water here. And then this will give this very important bond in nature -- -- which 
is known as the peptide bond. And there's a chemical property of this that's 
important. 

Someone was bemoaning the fact that I had to go over a bunch of chemistry and 
they hadn't liked 5.011. My apologies. But we won't be spend ing all course doing 

chemistry. But if you want to understand how these things work you do need to 
understand some of the chemical princip les to understand them. And this is a case 
where it's really important because, although it's written this way w ith the double 
bond here and a single bond there, this double bond actually sort of spends part of 
its time over here. 

So this is actua lly sort of a partia l double bond. And that has an  important 
consequence because if you're a sing le bond, if you remember a single bond can 
bend and stretch but it can a lso rotate. But if you're a double bond you cannot 
rotate. So the peptide bond, and you make a lot of these when you're polymerizing 
amino acids together to make proteins, those bonds have a very special character 
that they cannot rotate. 

Now, let me say, I'll come back and show you why that's important in just a 
moment. But let me just say a word about the side chains. There are 20 different 
amino acids. And they have side cha ins that have very different chemica l properties. 
And when we start thinking about how a chain of amino acids take up the properties 
that make it into an enzyme or part of a motor or a structural protein or into your 
finger nails or your hair or skin, they have to have very specia l properties. 

And it's the sequence of these different amino acids with their different chemical 
properties that are eventua lly going to let each protein form up to one particular 3-
dimensional structure that will give it its characteristics. So the d ifferent types of 
amino acids, and again you won't have to memorize these, but here they are up 
here. But let me just point out the important classes, because the thing you really 
want to do with this one is to remember the types of amino acids we find. 

There are negatively charged amino acids. An examp le of this would be aspartate. 
Under physiolog ica l conditions, a lthough this is an acid, it will d issociate so it will 
have a negative charge. And that's abbreviated as A-S-P. G lutamine is another one 
that has a negative charge. There are a lso amino acids that have positive charges on 
the side chain. An example of this would be lysine which has four methylene groups. 
And then it has an amino group. 

But, aga in, under physiological cond itions, around pH 7, that w ill be protonated so it 
will have a p lus charge. And that is lysine or L-Y-S. And arg inine and histidine are 
two other amino acids that have a positive charge, or can have a positive charge. 
Then there's a set of amino acids that have a polar character. They don't have a full 
charge. And, as you might guess, they have one of the bonds that we've talked 
about that are polar. 

This is serine. Serine. There's another one that has a hydroxyl that's known as 
threonine. And then there is a glutamine and asparagine, both of which have an N-H 
bond. So just through what I've told you here, we haven't even been through the 
set, you can see how you can beg in to decorate an amino acid cha in. So there's a 
plus charge and a minus charge, a polar charge. There's a tremendous amount of 
diversity because at every sing le thing you have a choice of 20 things you can put in. 

So they not only have size and shape characteristics, but they have particular 
charges and other properties. Then, as a lways,  there are a bunch of special, oh, 
excuse me. Actually, before we do that, we have hydrophobic. Or you could think of 
these as greasy or water-hating. These are the ones that are sort of when I was 
talking about trying to d issolve butter into water. These are things that don't like to 

interact with water or cannot interact with water, and so they cannot form hydrogen 
bonds so you cannot get them to go under water easily. 

And they come from very simp le ones that have just the methyl group which is 
alanine or A-L-A or one like this which would be CH2-CH with a couple of methyl 
groups. This is even more water-hating, that would be lucine, L-E-U. Or here's one 
that you probably could guess that really doesn't interact with water. This is 
phenylalanine or P-H-E. And you can see what this side chain is. It's a methylene 
group. 

And what's dang ling off it but a benzene ring. And I think most of you remember 
from probably beg inning chemistry that benzene is something that you cannot 
dissolve sugar in or something. It's an organic solvent. It w ill only dissolve things 
that have a very hydrophob ic character. Then there are some special cases. Glycine 
is one, because  in this case the side chain is simply a hydrogen atom. 

And, as a consequence to that, this  is a very flexible amino acid. So if you want to 
build -- If nature wants to build a loop into a protein, it's going to undergo a tight 
turn. You often find glycines there because there's not a big side cha in to get in the 
way if you're going to be bend ing the cha in in 3-dimensional space. Another one is 
cysteine, which looks like serine over there, but it has a thiol group instead of a 
hydroxyl group. 

And that's important because that allows for the formation of another special type of 
bond that  if you have one cha in of protein that has a cysteine on it and another 
polypeptide cha in that has a cysteine on it and they're close together in space, what 
can happen is you can form a covalent bond between these under oxidative 
cond itions. This is known as a disulfide bond. 

That's covalent. So those two chains, if that bond occurs, are now sort of semi-
permanently locked together. They're locked together in a very, very strong way. So 
this is a  feature of, this is the only intrastrand covalent bond that you'd 
characteristica lly find in proteins. All the rest of them we're going to show you, when 
they fold up in 3-dimensional space, depend on other kinds of interactions. 

And finally there's one last case which is proline. And  this one is a little different 
because in the amino acid the side chain bends around like this and joins here. So 
it's actually forming a little circle here between the nitrogen, the amino group and 
the carboxyl group. And the consequence of this is this bond cannot rotate. The bond 
that would normally be ab le to rotate is not ab le to do that. And so this is the sort of 
amino acid you  find that when there are some of these regular structures, I'm going 
to show you in a minute, like helices and  things, this protein won't, this amino acid 
particularly won't fit into those structures. 

So you tend to, if nature wants to interrupt a particular regular structure that's 
coming, it will often find a proline right at that particular point. OK. So what we've 
talked about up until now is sort of just the very, very basic piece of protein 
structure. It's what called the primary structure which is nothing more than the 
sequence of amino acids. However, here's a little p iece of protein. 

This is polyalanine. And one thing you can sort of see is if I was trying to  figure out 
how to fold this up into a 3-dimensiona l confirmation. And let's say this had 300 
amino acids or something,  there are essentia lly an infinite number of confirmations. 

And so one of the real holy grails still  in biology is trying to understand if you see the 
linear sequence of an amino acid, which we can now deduce, excuse me, of a 
protein, of an amino. 

If you see the linear sequence of amino acids in a protein, and we can deduce those 
from ana lyz ing genomes and so on, how do we go from a thing that says a 
tryptophan, a cysteine, a serine, a serine, a threonine, whatever down the cha in to 
find ing its 3-d imensiona l structure and ultimately its role? And you can sort of 
hopefully get a sense from this of why it's important. 

So there are levels this goes. The next level is what's known as secondary structure. 
These are regions of loca l secondary structure and they're determined by hydrogen 
bonds. And I'll show you how these go in just a second. And then you can think 
about proteins  in the tertiary structure. So what we've done and sort of taken a 
cha in and then  found out how a  little reg ion might take up a particular, for example, 
here's a portion that's in a helix. 

This is fa irly rig id right now because of the way it's held together. And we'll then find 
maybe another region like a beta sheet I'm going to show you in a minute. 
Ultimately we have to figure out how a ll these units fold up into a 3-dimensional 
structure. And what we get there is called the tertiary structure. And this has some 
other forces we're going to talk about besides covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds 
that determine that. 

And then, as I've tried to tell you, you can see that proteins play a lot of roles in 
nature and they're not all single proteins running around being an enzyme or 
something like that. Many of them are parts of machines so they're made to fit 
together in absolutely beautiful ways. Some of them have, at this point,  fifty-
hundred parts that all go together fitting shapes and interacting w ith these shapes 
on the princip les that we'll be ta lking about here, the different forces that make 
things happen in nature. 

And so quaternary means the structure when there's more than one polypeptide 
cha in. So getting a handle on protein structure was kind of a very important 
intractab le problem for a long  time because it was just too hard a nut to crack, but  in 
the 1930s and 1940s x-ray crystallography started to come into usage where 
basically you'd bounce x-rays off of a crysta l. And then they would  refract and you'd 
see characteristic reflections. 

And you could work backwards to  figure out what the structure of the crysta l was. 
This had been app lied to minerals and a lot of structure, but it hadn't been app lied to 
proteins. When people started to look they found there were certa in proteins that 
gave characteristic reflections. Keratin, for example. Your ha ir gives a characteristic 
reflection around 5.4 angstroms. So that suggested that there was a repeating unit 
somewhere in keratin that had this. 

And, again, w ith artificial peptides sometimes they were ab le to see these reflections. 
And so that was where things stood  for a while. And then one of these secondary 
structures, a very, very important one known as the alpha helix was deduced by 
Linus Pauling. Some of you have heard of him. He was a  famous chemist at Caltech. 
He got the Nobel prize. He a lso got famous later in his career because he 
championed the use of vitamin C to cure every ill known to mankind, includ ing the 
common cold. 

Although there's some merit to what Linus stated, he probably overstated some of 
those later findings, but his contributions to the underlying chemistry and 
biochemistry of proteins was amazing. And he was the one that figured out the 
structure that exp lained the 5.4 angstrom repeat. And it was kind of an interesting 
story. He was in Oxford, England. And he got sick. I think it was some time in the 
winter. 

And he got bored  reading detective books after a while so he thought he'd try and 
figure out the structure of proteins that gave rise to this characteristic repeat. So he 
made a simp lifying assumption. He decided he'd forget a ll the side chains and just 
focus on this peptide backbone just w ith the peptide bond. And he was a chemist. 
And he knew, what I just told you, that this had a partial double bond character so it 
couldn't rotate. 

And he reasoned that this was held together by, since these things could form 
hydrogen bonds that this was probably forming a hydrogen bond with a carboxyl 
group of some other amino acid and this was probably forming a hydrogen bond w ith 
an amino group of a different amino acid. And so what he d id was he made a sort of 
cha in like this and he started to pleat it at the a lpha carbon, which is the one that 
has the side chain on it, and was trying to  find  the structure that would let him do 
this. 

And basica lly what he found was that if he made a helix that looks something like 
this, right-handed helix, and he could get a  repeat structure that allowed him to  form 
a hydrogen bond. And the repeating unit was 5.4 angstroms and 3.7, excuse me, 
amino acids per turn. And  it's a right-handed helix. It's the same sort of thing if 
you're trying to turn in a screw. It's got that kind of structure. 

And this shows you a little movie of an alpha helix. You can see this  is just showing 
the backbone. So this is the part you can look right down the end of it. See how you 
can look right though? And you can see how the hydrogen bonds are formed by 
turning this thing into this regular structure. And the neat thing about this then  is if 
you put on the side chains, and you can put them on in any order, you can build a 
tremendous amount of diversity even within that helical structure. 

I think I can stop this. I just want to show you one thing, if I can manage to this 
when it comes around again. Stop it there. One of the things you can see, now we're 
looking down the helix. And although you won't recognize the structures of a ll the 
amino acids right away, you may be ab le to see in this particular one. Here are a 
coup le of aromatic rings off on this side. 

So this side of the helix wouldn't like to see water, and over here are a bunch of 
charged and polar amino acids. So you could see how you could build into a helix  like 
that, a surface, one part that wouldn't like to interact w ith water and another part 
that would. So that was an extremely  important contribution. And there are alpha 
helices in a lmost a ll proteins. They'll be  in little chunks coming down an amino acids 
cha in. 

But they'll take up that structure. And, as you can see, it's driven by these hydrogen 
bonds that we've been talking about. There turns out then to be a second type of 
secondary structure that's important. It's called a beta sheet. And in this case you 
can either line up two polypeptide chains running in the same orientation, amino to 

carboxyl, amino to carboxyl, or you can run them in opposite orientations, amino to 
carboxyl, amino to carboxyl in the other way. 

The latter one  is called an anti-parallel beta sheet. And if you line things up this way 
you'll see you can find hydrogen bonds between the chains  like that. So this a llows 
two things to form in this way and gives a sort of sheet- like structure. Whereas, that 
alpha helix has this tight coil like this. So over here I think we have a movie of a 
beta sheet. And you'll see aga in you can build up more than one. 

Because if you look up here you can see how you are a ll set up to form more 
hydrogen bonds out in that kind of way. And, as I said, you can do this same trick 
putting the polypeptide cha ins so they have the same polarity. And so you can 
approximate, look at the structure of most proteins then by depicting them either as 
alpha helices, which you'll see  in these d iagrams. 

You've already seen a  few  in the examples g iven. They'll look like this. Or a beta 
sheet which are ind icated as these flat arrows. So here's a little piece of a protein 
made up of alpha helix, these beta sheets. What this is, actually, is a p iece of the 
BRCA-1 gene. That's the familial susceptibility to breast cancer. The gene that 
causes that is ca lled BRCA-1. 

And it has a special interaction domain called the BRC T domain. This is the 
structure. And the only point I'm trying to make, it's of a protein that's involved in 
preventing you from getting breast cancer. If you get a mutation in it, or particularly 
in this region, for example, you can end up w ith an increased susceptibility to breast 
cancer. But what is it? It's an a lpha helices beta sheet. 

There's green fluorescent protein. You've seen that a  few times. Maybe now you'll 
recognize it's mostly made of beta sheets. There's a little bit of alpha helix down 
there, a little b it right there. And that has the property that we've talked about of 
fluorescing. This  is a protein I'll tell you later on that recognizes mismatches  in DNA, 
and you get a susceptibility to cancer if it breaks. 

The only thing you notice here are a lot of a lpha helices in it. And hopefully already 
your eye can beg in to pick these out. This is an enzyme. What it does is it's got a 
cata lytic ab ility to cleave other polypeptide chains. The functions of these don't 
matter. But you can see once aga in alpha helices beta sheets. Here's another one. It 
looks just about the same, a lpha helices, beta sheets, except in this case this is the 
human gene known as, the protein encoded by human genes ca lled RAS. 

That's an oncogene. That's a gene that if it mutates in a particular way will cause the 
cell that has that to move a step down the pathway to cancer. So what I've done is 
put up a whole lot of structures that have some alpha helices, some beta sheets. But 
you can get the idea that you can get very, very different b iological activities from 
just depend ing on how you arrange those. 

OK. So there are a couple of other then forces that I need to tell you about if we're 
going to go all the way to understand ing the 3-d imensional structure of proteins. 
What we can get to  from that is alpha helices beta sheets. But you saw  there were 
loops, there were other interactions that I haven't accounted for in showing you 
those 3-dimensional structures. So one of them is ionic bonds. 

This is the third class of force. This  is an extreme case of electron sharing where one 
atom gets a ll of the electrons. So aspartate, which I had up on the board, aspartic 
acid looks like that, but under physiolog ica l conditions the oxygen will get all the 
electrons and you'll have a hydrogen on it. And a consequence of that then is that if 
you have a polypeptide chain that over here has an aspartate and over here has a 
lysine, which is the four methylene groups, and the positively charged thing here, 
you can get an ionic bond between those two amino acids that can be very far apart 
on the polypeptide chain. 

There may be a lot of amino acids  in between, but what they then do is bring these 
two points together and hold them like that. The next class of force is kind of tricky. 
You may have heard of it in chemistry. It's referred to as van der Waals interaction. 
And the basis of this, without going  into it too much, is even a nonpolar bond -- --
can have a transient polarity. And this then induces -- -- a transient polarity  in a 
nearby bond. 

And it has to be a  really nearby bond. So about 0.2 to 0.4 nanometers. Remember, 
covalent bonds are roughly ha lf that distance or something. So  it's got to be a very, 
very close  interaction. It's weak. It's only one-third to one-quarter of a hydrogen 
bond, which you may reca ll is about one-twentieth of a cova lent bond. But there can 
be many, many of them if the surfaces fit together rea lly, rea lly tightly. 

So if you have a protein  fold, so there's a surface here, and then it folds up in such a 
way that there's a surface here, then you can get a lot of van der Waa ls interactions 
down here. Now, I've never had a  rea lly good way of exp laining this. But today, part 
of these activities of this Hughes Professorship, I've set up some seminars on 
teaching. And I've invited a guy from Berkley named Robert Full who is ta lking in 68-
180 at 4:00 PM. 

And I borrowed some things from him this morning. And we're just going to take a 
quick tour because I want to show you this. He works on, well, he does a  lot of 
things. He works on b iomotion and how animals work. But one of the things he 
works on, let's see if we can get this guy to go here. Oops. How do I figure out how 
to get it to play here? Hang on a second. I just discovered that the PowerPoint is not 
really terribly effective. 

So this isn't working as nicely as I would like. OK. Let's try this. Just a minute. 
Where are we? Here we go. OK. Let's see if I can get this to go. So he studies a 
bunch of things, but he d id an undergrad project library studying geckos. And here 
this is a transparent surface. And he's studying how the geckos climb up and down 
the thing. And they were making measurements. 

And they found they couldn't account for why this was such an efficient organism. It 
used much  less energy than most things, so they started looking into how it adhered 
to the surface. It can go up a vertica l wa ll, as you can see here. And so they were 
able to look underneath and they could see, see how it sort of peels off the surface? 
And this was a  robot that they eventually built that's not using the same molecular 
bases but uses this peeling thing. 

And they can get a robot that climbs up a wall. But that's not what we're going to 
talk about here. We're going to instead, I hope, go back to here. And you can see 
that all of the geckos have these sort of bizarre toes, and so they started looking to 
see what the underlying princip le of this was. And they saw it has these setae. And 

they got looking in greater deta il and blew it up. And  then they found that there 
were, as they started looking there were these  little ha irs. 

And that's a 900-fold magnification. And once they got looking in more deta il they 
found the ends were split so that they were, the very ends are about 200 
nanometers roughly at the end of this. And so a gecko has about a b illion of these on 
its feet. And what it turns out it does -- And just to see, here's a human hair. You 
see how it splits down? Now, this  is made of keratin, the molecule I just mentioned 
that was used, alpha helices, but it's very, very fine. 

And what it can do, it can make van der Waa ls interactions. This is an anima l that 
sticks to the wall by van der Waals interactions. And the peeling away allows it to 
break those bonds. But, as you can see, they're enormously important. He's got here 
a micrograph. They're measuring the force, and  the force  is just huge. This is the 
end of the thing, the frayed end sticking to a surface. 

And for those of you who didn't think biology any relevance to you, Bob was telling 
me about this. They followed up, he's an eng ineer as well and builds interd isciplinary 
teams, and they've measured this stuff. But this is turning into what appears to look 
like it's going to be a $30 to $50 billion industry as a ll sorts of things are -- They're 
beginning to rea lize it can hold car parts together, it can go in space shuttles, Post-it 
notes. 

And here's a little Band-Aid they made. They own the patent on this self-cleaning dry 
adhesive. It doesn't have to be made out of gecko stuff. It could be made out of all 
sorts of things. But, anyway, here's an examp le of where not only are van der Waals 
forces very  important, but where somebody who stud ied a very simply aspect of 
biology worrying about the efficiency of how geckos ran and pushed it a ll the way 
down to the molecular level understood a principal that's going to make somebody a 
very large amount of money. 

OK. The last, and if anybody wants to come, he's an amazing speaker. Perhaps one 
of the most exciting speakers I've ever heard. 68-180, 4:00 PM if you want to go. 
He'll have more of that sort of stuff to show you then. OK. So the last force here, it's 
not rea lly a force, but what we'll ca ll hydrophobic effects. And what I mean by this is 
that the principle of this is that amino acids that don't like to interact with water, so -
- So hydrophobic amino acids. 

These are ones  like  lucine and phenyla lanine. Well, I showed you the water the other 
day and how it was forming hydrogen bonds between the molecules. So if you're 
going to stick another molecule in there, you're going to break a bunch of bonds. 
And if you're not charged or polar you cannot make new bonds with the water. And 
so what happens, if you put these together, just like if you put oil together it will all 
bundle up and it w ill minimize its interactions with water. 

And that's what proteins do. Here's the structure of a protein a ll folded up in 3-
dimensional space. And you can see at the core of the protein how there are these 
many hydrophobic amino acids that are interacting. And let me just, I'm going to 
close by show ing you one more little movie. And the new version of PowerPoint 
doesn't do this well so I'm just going to get out of this for a second here. 

This is a really cool movie I saw. I want to show you a DNA repa ir protein sticking to 
a piece of helix. Can you hit the lights somebody there? So this is a lesion on a piece 

of, see the double helix here? And what I especially liked about this is this is sort of a 
Star Wars movie. You're going to  fly down the major groove of a double helix. And 
you can see where this particular protein  folded up in 3-dimensional space is 
reaching down into that helix. 

So this is sort of putting together the two things that I've been telling you about. 
This blue is a DNA repa ir protein. Oopsy da isy. A DNA repa ir protein that's ab le to 
find a lesion in the DNA. And here's the doub le helix that's the two chains held 
together by hydrogen bonds. And then, as you can see, there's a groove on each 
side. And the protein  is searching down into that groove --
