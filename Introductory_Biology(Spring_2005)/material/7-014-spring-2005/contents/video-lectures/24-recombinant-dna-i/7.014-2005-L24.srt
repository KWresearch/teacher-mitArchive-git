1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:05
OK, so I'd like to go now to the
next segment of the course.

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:11
Think you can probably appreciate
little bit better this triangle I

3
00:00:11 --> 00:00:17
had on before about how what
biochemists did was they tended to

4
00:00:17 --> 00:00:23
break cells open,
look at the component parts,

5
00:00:23 --> 00:00:29
through other things in there,
and then proteins.

6
00:00:29 --> 00:00:33
But an awful lot of stuff having to
do with function is proteins,

7
00:00:33 --> 00:00:37
and what geneticists, the discipline
of genetics would do,

8
00:00:37 --> 00:00:41
which made mutants of living
organisms, and that looked at how

9
00:00:41 --> 00:00:45
function was affected by mutating
individual genes,

10
00:00:45 --> 00:00:49
how those were both very powerful
approaches.  Genetics told you what

11
00:00:49 --> 00:00:53
was really important,
and biochemistry told you how it

12
00:00:53 --> 00:00:57
worked at a molecular level,
but the real problem is knowing

13
00:00:57 --> 00:01:01
whether this thing you had doing
something in the test tube was

14
00:01:01 --> 00:01:06
actually the one that
did it in life.

15
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
And I think it'll do when Arthur
Kornberg isolated the very first DNA

16
00:01:09 --> 00:01:13
polymerase, he was able to copy DNA.
And he got a Nobel prize, and it

17
00:01:13 --> 00:01:17
was the first enzyme that could copy
DNA, and then John Karens made a

18
00:01:17 --> 00:01:20
mutant that was lacking the enzyme.
And the organism was still alive.

19
00:01:20 --> 00:01:24
So therefore, it couldn't have been
the DNA polymerase that was copying

20
00:01:24 --> 00:01:28
the chromosome.
It actually turned out to be a DNA

21
00:01:28 --> 00:01:31
repair enzyme.
So, if you can actually unite

22
00:01:31 --> 00:01:35
genetics and biochemistry,
if you can take a mutant that's

23
00:01:35 --> 00:01:39
broken in a function and you found
your protein was missing,

24
00:01:39 --> 00:01:42
or vice versa, then you had a very,
very powerful insight because you

25
00:01:42 --> 00:01:46
connect your knowledge of what was
physiologically important to the

26
00:01:46 --> 00:01:50
biochemistry that you're doing.
But it was really, really hard for

27
00:01:50 --> 00:01:53
years, and only in very rare
occasions did some geneticists have

28
00:01:53 --> 00:01:57
a mutant that suggests so strongly
that some biochemists would look,

29
00:01:57 --> 00:02:01
or some biochemists would have such
a powerful result that they talked

30
00:02:01 --> 00:02:05
to a geneticist and seen if anybody
had found the result.

31
00:02:05 --> 00:02:08
And the power of recombinant DNA,
although it started a biotech

32
00:02:08 --> 00:02:12
industry, and it made possible the
sequencing of the genome,

33
00:02:12 --> 00:02:16
there's another level up one higher
in conceptual understanding.

34
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
And what it did was, it let you go
back and forth between here and here.

35
00:02:20 --> 00:02:24
You wouldn't have any problem now
if I gave you the sequencing of the

36
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
gene, you can order it.
You could stick it in a cell and

37
00:02:27 --> 00:02:31
make massive amounts of the protein.
You purified it twenty-fold and it

38
00:02:31 --> 00:02:35
would be pure,
whereas before you might have had to

39
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
purified it fifteen thousand-fold
out of 1,000 g of cells,

40
00:02:39 --> 00:02:43
and you would have had to been a
very good biochemists with 15 steps

41
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
in order to purify it.
So, you can go from the sequence of

42
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
the gene to the protein,
or if we got a protein and we wanted

43
00:02:50 --> 00:02:54
to know which gene we'd just
sequence a bit of the protein,

44
00:02:54 --> 00:02:58
use that genetic code, work
ourselves backwards to some possible

45
00:02:58 --> 00:03:02
sequences, then go looking for the
sequences, and then go

46
00:03:02 --> 00:03:05
find the gene.
So, what recombinant DNA allows us

47
00:03:05 --> 00:03:09
to do is close that loop.
You can go from genetics to

48
00:03:09 --> 00:03:13
biochemistry at back and forth.
Now everybody does everything

49
00:03:13 --> 00:03:17
instead of it being isolated
disciplines, which it was when I

50
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
entered the field.
So, all of the stuff depended on

51
00:03:20 --> 00:03:24
the development to clone particular
pieces of DNA.

52
00:03:24 --> 00:03:28
And I want to make clear right at
the beginning,

53
00:03:28 --> 00:03:32
there's a couple of uses of cloning
that are in popular

54
00:03:32 --> 00:03:35
usage right now.
What we're talking about in this

55
00:03:35 --> 00:03:39
lecture is cloning a piece of DNA.
What that means, is I'm going to

56
00:03:39 --> 00:03:43
take a particular segment of DNA,
say, cut it here, and cut it there.

57
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
And I'm going to take that piece,
and I'm going to do something to it

58
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
that lets me amplify it and make
many, many copies of that piece of

59
00:03:50 --> 00:03:54
DNA.  And cloning of anything else
you make a whole lot of copies.

60
00:03:54 --> 00:03:58
So that's one use of the word
cloning.

61
00:03:58 --> 00:04:03
The other use,
which you see in the popular press

62
00:04:03 --> 00:04:08
all the time, is cloning an
individual, but not being there but

63
00:04:08 --> 00:04:13
you would take the nucleus from the
cell of the individual,

64
00:04:13 --> 00:04:19
he put that nucleus into an egg that
didn't have its own nucleus moved,

65
00:04:19 --> 00:04:24
and now you hope what you get out of
that is an organism that has all the

66
00:04:24 --> 00:04:30
same genetic content as the
starting individual.

67
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
And in fact, although it sounds very
good in paper,

68
00:04:33 --> 00:04:37
is you're probably beginning to see
it's not the panacea that people

69
00:04:37 --> 00:04:41
thought it was,
or that we'd have to worry that in

70
00:04:41 --> 00:04:45
10 years, all of my MIT students
would be clones of the brightest

71
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
person in the class or anything like
that, because other stuff happens,

72
00:04:48 --> 00:04:52
because unless you go on to advanced
biology courses,

73
00:04:52 --> 00:04:56
but there are modifications of DNA.
There's all sorts of stuff that

74
00:04:56 --> 00:05:00
happens to it, so it's
not identical.

75
00:05:00 --> 00:05:03
And so many of these cloned
organisms, like Dolly the sheep,

76
00:05:03 --> 00:05:07
that was famous, died early with,
I forget, arthritis and things.  So,

77
00:05:07 --> 00:05:11
there are a lot of problems on that
score.  But that's the other use of

78
00:05:11 --> 00:05:15
the word cloning and that's not what
these next three lectures that we

79
00:05:15 --> 00:05:19
are talking about cloning a piece of
DNA.  And that was the big problem

80
00:05:19 --> 00:05:22
that faced the field,
certainly when I was an undergrad

81
00:05:22 --> 00:05:26
and even when I was a grad student I
was interested in synthesizing

82
00:05:26 --> 00:05:30
pieces of DNA,
and it was one of those things that

83
00:05:30 --> 00:05:34
people said, why are you doing it?
Well, because you could try to do

84
00:05:34 --> 00:05:38
it.  What if you got a piece of DNA,
like Gobind Khorana, who's my

85
00:05:38 --> 00:05:42
colleague, who got the Nobel prize
for synthesizing the first gene.

86
00:05:42 --> 00:05:46
He synthesized it.
It was a tRNA gene that was 120

87
00:05:46 --> 00:05:50
nucleotide base pairs long or
something.  He synthesized it.

88
00:05:50 --> 00:05:55
He'd shown you could do it.  But
you couldn't do anything with it.

89
00:05:55 --> 00:05:59
And there were sort of two big
problems.  One was the fact that

90
00:05:59 --> 00:06:04
this DNA, although it's not its a
monotonous tetranucleotide.

91
00:06:04 --> 00:06:07
It's pretty hard to tell.
Each one of these things is a base

92
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
pair, and human DNA has 3 billion of
those.  And a bit down here,

93
00:06:11 --> 00:06:15
doesn't look very different than the
bit out there.

94
00:06:15 --> 00:06:19
And it certainly wouldn't looks
very different than the bit of DNA

95
00:06:19 --> 00:06:23
that's 2 billion base pairs over on
the other side of campus or

96
00:06:23 --> 00:06:27
something.  So,
there is no way to take DNA and cut

97
00:06:27 --> 00:06:31
it reproducibly, so you
to get fragments.

98
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
What you could see from first
principles was what you would need

99
00:06:34 --> 00:06:38
was magic scissors.
And what would the scissors look

100
00:06:38 --> 00:06:41
like?  Well, it would have to be
scissors that could be sequenced

101
00:06:41 --> 00:06:45
because there's nothing else
different.  You know it's a regular

102
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
backbone, and it's only four
nucleotides.  So,

103
00:06:48 --> 00:06:52
if you wanted to cut DNA in
particular places,

104
00:06:52 --> 00:06:55
you had to have scissors that could
see a sequence.

105
00:06:55 --> 00:06:59
And furthermore,
you can see they couldn't just,

106
00:06:59 --> 00:07:02
there are the hydrogen bonding parts
of ANT or GNC because those are

107
00:07:02 --> 00:07:06
stuck together there in
the middle of the DNA.

108
00:07:06 --> 00:07:10
So, you'd need scissors that could
somehow find a sequence and make a

109
00:07:10 --> 00:07:14
cut.  And those were found.
I'm going to till you about those.

110
00:07:14 --> 00:07:18
They're called restriction enzymes.
So that was part of the thing.  The

111
00:07:18 --> 00:07:22
other thing was,
imagine I could cut out this

112
00:07:22 --> 00:07:26
fragment.  And they gave it to you,
and I said, great.  Now I've got it.

113
00:07:26 --> 00:07:30
Would you make me a lot of copies
of this DNA?

114
00:07:30 --> 00:07:35
Could you do that?
Let's say, you now know how to

115
00:07:35 --> 00:07:41
transform the principle that we saw
back with Avery.

116
00:07:41 --> 00:07:46
We could take naked DNA and put
this fragment into the cell.

117
00:07:46 --> 00:07:52
Would it replicate?  What do you
think?  Anybody remember?

118
00:07:52 --> 00:07:58
No?  OK, we talked about some other
languages, right?

119
00:07:58 --> 00:08:02
But one of the things that's in the
DNA is the genetic code with all the

120
00:08:02 --> 00:08:06
genes.  And we can find the reading
frame.  Remember when we talked

121
00:08:06 --> 00:08:10
about an origin of replication.
I said that was sort of, at least

122
00:08:10 --> 00:08:15
for E. coli there's one origin.
In eukaryotes the origins are

123
00:08:15 --> 00:08:19
spaced out along the DNA.
And every time you have a round of

124
00:08:19 --> 00:08:23
replication, it starts with one of
those origins and then goes.

125
00:08:23 --> 00:08:27
So the chance of this piece of DNA
by chance is going to have an origin

126
00:08:27 --> 00:08:32
is pretty small.
So if I put it into an organism,

127
00:08:32 --> 00:08:36
it's going to sit there, if you're
lucky, make it degraded because it's

128
00:08:36 --> 00:08:40
got [blend ins?
, or even if I made it into circle

129
00:08:40 --> 00:08:44
it probably wouldn't replicate
because it probably doesn't have the

130
00:08:44 --> 00:08:49
word in the DNA that says start a
round of DNA replication.

131
00:08:49 --> 00:08:53
So, the other overarching principle
of DNA replication is you somehow

132
00:08:53 --> 00:08:57
have to take the fragment of DNA
that you're looking at,

133
00:08:57 --> 00:09:02
and you have to attach it to an
origin of replication.

134
00:09:02 --> 00:09:06
Now, if you have an origin of
replication and you have a fragment

135
00:09:06 --> 00:09:10
of DNA, and you put it in the cell,
now you'll get a lot of copies of

136
00:09:10 --> 00:09:14
that piece of DNA.
So that's what recombinant DNA is

137
00:09:14 --> 00:09:18
all about in a really,
really simple form.  I'm just going

138
00:09:18 --> 00:09:22
to take you now into increasing sort
of levels of detail.

139
00:09:22 --> 00:09:26
So, let me just sort of give you
just sort of a really broad view of

140
00:09:26 --> 00:09:30
this cloning, and then we'll sort of
start to dive in to some of the

141
00:09:30 --> 00:09:35
fancier techniques that
have come out of this.

142
00:09:35 --> 00:09:40
We'll talk about DNA sequencing,
and PCR, and stuff in the next

143
00:09:40 --> 00:09:45
lecture.  So the first principle
here is to cut the DNA,

144
00:09:45 --> 00:09:50
and I know you may think this is
sort of baby talk,

145
00:09:50 --> 00:09:55
but this is how I think.
If you really think about this

146
00:09:55 --> 00:10:00
stuff, this is what it really is.
With sequence specific molecular

147
00:10:00 --> 00:10:06
scissors, these have the
rather odd name.

148
00:10:06 --> 00:10:10
They're called restriction enzymes.
I don't know if any of you know why

149
00:10:10 --> 00:10:14
they're called restriction enzymes,
and although I'm sure that some of

150
00:10:14 --> 00:10:18
you have used them in your op to cut
up pieces of DNA.

151
00:10:18 --> 00:10:22
But what that does,
these are enzymes, as I'll tell you,

152
00:10:22 --> 00:10:26
that recognize a particular sequence.
And they always cut at that

153
00:10:26 --> 00:10:30
sequence.  In the value of that is
you can reproducibly cut DNA exactly

154
00:10:30 --> 00:10:34
the same spot,
and the spots are specified by

155
00:10:34 --> 00:10:38
whatever sequence that particular
pair of scissors knows how to read.

156
00:10:38 --> 00:10:42
Then the next thing we have to do is
we need to join the piece of DNA to

157
00:10:42 --> 00:10:47
an origin of replication.
So the thing that carries the

158
00:10:47 --> 00:10:51
origin of replication is called a
vector.  And usually,

159
00:10:51 --> 00:10:56
not always, these are circles.
We'll consider the ones that grow

160
00:10:56 --> 00:11:00
in E. coli are most of the time,
or in bacteria, mostly circles.

161
00:11:00 --> 00:11:05
They are the ones that are broadly
used for most cloning.

162
00:11:05 --> 00:11:12
So, we'll talk about those.
What makes a vector?  When it has

163
00:11:12 --> 00:11:19
to have is an origin of DNA
replication.  They usually have

164
00:11:19 --> 00:11:26
something else.
We could call it a selectable

165
00:11:26 --> 00:11:34
marker, but something like
a drug resistance.

166
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
If any of you have done cloning in a
UROP usually it's something like a

167
00:11:37 --> 00:11:41
gene for making the cell ampicillin
resistant, or tetracycline resistant,

168
00:11:41 --> 00:11:45
some antibiotic that would normally
kill the cell.

169
00:11:45 --> 00:11:48
So you can tell,
does that cell have that vector or

170
00:11:48 --> 00:11:52
not because the cell starts at
either ampicillin sensitive.

171
00:11:52 --> 00:11:56
It acquires the vector that's
replicating it,

172
00:11:56 --> 00:12:00
also acquires the gene that gives it
the drug resistance.

173
00:12:00 --> 00:12:06
But if we're going to cut that,
if we're going to join a piece of

174
00:12:06 --> 00:12:12
DNA to that, we can't join into a
circle without breaking it.

175
00:12:12 --> 00:12:18
So, we need to cut the vector at a
unique site.  And we would use a

176
00:12:18 --> 00:12:24
restriction enzyme for that.
And you can also see in designing a

177
00:12:24 --> 00:12:30
vector, you'd want something that
only has one site.

178
00:12:30 --> 00:12:35
So, what we would have achieved from
this conceptually as we've now got

179
00:12:35 --> 00:12:41
this, this is the vector,
its origin of replication here,

180
00:12:41 --> 00:12:46
and let's say ampicillin resistance,
for example, as a selectable marker,

181
00:12:46 --> 00:12:52
the gene for that could be encoded
here.  And we have the fragment of,

182
00:12:52 --> 00:12:58
if you want to that down, just put
it down on the floor,

183
00:12:58 --> 00:13:04
I think.  We've made the point at
this stage.  Thanks.

184
00:13:04 --> 00:13:10
What one has to do is to join this
piece of DNA to that.

185
00:13:10 --> 00:13:17
And we'll go to the molecular
details of this.

186
00:13:17 --> 00:13:23
But, we'll join the fragment to the
vector, and actually this was

187
00:13:23 --> 00:13:30
something that was already in
molecular biologists' toolkits,

188
00:13:30 --> 00:13:35
have been studying DNA replication.
That's DNA ligase.

189
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
When we finish an Okazaki fragment,
we had to seal [UNINTELLIGIBLE] and

190
00:13:38 --> 00:13:42
the enzyme that did that was an
enzyme called DNA ligase.

191
00:13:42 --> 00:13:45
So, molecular biologists basically
had the scotch tape or the glue to

192
00:13:45 --> 00:13:48
join stuff back together.
What they were missing for many,

193
00:13:48 --> 00:13:51
many years where the sequence
specific molecular scissors.

194
00:13:51 --> 00:13:55
So at this stage, if we were doing
the recombinant DNA,

195
00:13:55 --> 00:13:58
we now have a vector.
We now have a piece of DNA joined

196
00:13:58 --> 00:14:03
to it.
In fact, we probably have a whole

197
00:14:03 --> 00:14:09
other mess of things that happens
along the way.

198
00:14:09 --> 00:14:15
But at the moment,
they're in a test tube.

199
00:14:15 --> 00:14:22
So, if we want to have this thing
grow, what do we have to do next?

200
00:14:22 --> 00:14:28
We are going to have to get the DNA
from outside the cell inside the

201
00:14:28 --> 00:14:35
cell.  That's the word; we need to
transform the DNA into a cell.

202
00:14:35 --> 00:14:38
Again, the word transform,
that goes back to those

203
00:14:38 --> 00:14:42
transformation experiments with the
Streptococcus pneumonia going from

204
00:14:42 --> 00:14:45
smooth to rough,
and you are taking stuff from the

205
00:14:45 --> 00:14:49
cell that transformed them from
rough to smooth,

206
00:14:49 --> 00:14:53
whatever, that's where the word came
from, but we now know it's getting

207
00:14:53 --> 00:14:56
naked DNA inside the cell where it
can be replicated.

208
00:14:56 --> 00:15:00
And then the next thing we need to
know is, what cells have acquired

209
00:15:00 --> 00:15:04
this vector that at least
as the vector.

210
00:15:04 --> 00:15:09
We'll settle for that in the
beginning, and to do that,

211
00:15:09 --> 00:15:14
you need to select for the marker on
the vector.  In the case of this one,

212
00:15:14 --> 00:15:19
we would start with a strain that
killed my ampicillin,

213
00:15:19 --> 00:15:25
and then we just play it out and ask
for guys that are ampicillin

214
00:15:25 --> 00:15:29
resistant.
And, you can see that there is

215
00:15:29 --> 00:15:33
another class of problem because if
we had uncut vector,

216
00:15:33 --> 00:15:36
and there would probably be,
for sure, some of that in our mix,

217
00:15:36 --> 00:15:40
that would make the cells ampicillin.
And if we had an insert,

218
00:15:40 --> 00:15:43
it would also be ampicillin.
So, if we really wanted to get into

219
00:15:43 --> 00:15:47
this, we'd have to do some more work
to sort out what's on there.

220
00:15:47 --> 00:15:51
But that's the basic stuff.  I
suspect most of you know this

221
00:15:51 --> 00:15:54
practically since kindergarten.
But that's the overall framework

222
00:15:54 --> 00:15:58
into which, now,
I'm going to start layering

223
00:15:58 --> 00:16:01
different pieces of detail.
And the next part,

224
00:16:01 --> 00:16:05
again, some of you may know.
I don't think it will be a totally

225
00:16:05 --> 00:16:09
foreign concept.
You are probably familiar with this,

226
00:16:09 --> 00:16:13
that what are these restriction
enzymes?  The actual word is

227
00:16:13 --> 00:16:16
restriction endonuclease.
They are often usually called

228
00:16:16 --> 00:16:20
restriction enzymes in a lab
[parlons?].  Nuclease is something

229
00:16:20 --> 00:16:24
that cuts the nucleic acid,
and endonuclease is one that doesn't

230
00:16:24 --> 00:16:28
need a free end.
So, it can cut in the middle of the

231
00:16:28 --> 00:16:32
sequence instead of nibbling at the
end.  That would be

232
00:16:32 --> 00:16:37
an exonuclease.
So, these things have names that

233
00:16:37 --> 00:16:43
tend to be something like ECO-R1,
which has something to do with where

234
00:16:43 --> 00:16:50
they are derived from.
And a typical one, one of the very

235
00:16:50 --> 00:16:56
first ones that is still in really
wide use, is ECO-R1.

236
00:16:56 --> 00:17:03
And this recognizes the sequence G
A A T T C.

237
00:17:03 --> 00:17:07
Now, you'll notice that if you read
the sequence in this way it's the

238
00:17:07 --> 00:17:11
same sequence when you read it on
the other strand.

239
00:17:11 --> 00:17:15
It's called a palindrome but be
careful because palindromes in

240
00:17:15 --> 00:17:19
English, those are words that you
read from the front to the back;

241
00:17:19 --> 00:17:23
they're the same.
In an English letter,

242
00:17:23 --> 00:17:28
it doesn't matter whether it's in A
here or an A there.

243
00:17:28 --> 00:17:32
But you guys know something about
DNA structure.

244
00:17:32 --> 00:17:36
There's a five to three prime
polarity.  So,

245
00:17:36 --> 00:17:40
reading this way doesn't look at all
the same.  It's totally different.

246
00:17:40 --> 00:17:45
But reading in this strand, we say
that's five to three.

247
00:17:45 --> 00:17:49
The thing that's identical is the
reciprocal sequence on the other

248
00:17:49 --> 00:17:53
side.  So there is this,
you see G A A and G A A but it's not

249
00:17:53 --> 00:17:58
like the English word palindrome,
so get yourself mixed up about that.

250
00:17:58 --> 00:18:03
Anyway, what this will then,
what this enzyme then does, is it

251
00:18:03 --> 00:18:08
cuts to the side here.
It cuts symmetrically.

252
00:18:08 --> 00:18:14
And what it generates them is a G
three prime hydroxyl.

253
00:18:14 --> 00:18:19
Remember the ribose?  If we have,
say, an A there, this is the three

254
00:18:19 --> 00:18:25
prime position,
and that's the five prime position

255
00:18:25 --> 00:18:30
in the sugar.  So,
it leaves a three prime hydroxyl,

256
00:18:30 --> 00:18:36
and is also then leaves a five prime
phosphate.

257
00:18:36 --> 00:18:45
So, we'd have A A T T C here,
and then on the other side, we would

258
00:18:45 --> 00:18:54
get the reciprocal thing.
So, we'd have G with a three prime

259
00:18:54 --> 00:19:03
hydroxyl, and then over
A A T T C like that.

260
00:19:03 --> 00:19:07
So now we've got a break here.
We can pull those apart.  But one

261
00:19:07 --> 00:19:12
of the nice things you can see right
from this is that we're generating

262
00:19:12 --> 00:19:17
five prime single stranded ends,
and this one is the sequence A A T T

263
00:19:17 --> 00:19:22
C.  This is A A T T C here,
and these guys, if they could get

264
00:19:22 --> 00:19:27
together and line up as they would
here, they'd be able to

265
00:19:27 --> 00:19:32
form hydrogen bonds.
So, if you take an enzyme like

266
00:19:32 --> 00:19:36
ECO-R1,  and we took,
let's say, a circle that had a

267
00:19:36 --> 00:19:40
single ECO-R1 site,
G A A T T C, if we cut it with the

268
00:19:40 --> 00:19:44
restriction enzyme we would make
[nicks?].  And if we kept a cold,

269
00:19:44 --> 00:19:48
all that we'd have is DNA nicks.
And if we warm things up a little

270
00:19:48 --> 00:19:52
bit, there's only four hydrogen
bonds that are holding that together.

271
00:19:52 --> 00:19:56
So, the thing would linearize and
just flop around in the breeze.

272
00:19:56 --> 00:20:00
If we cooled it slowly, the
thermodynamically most favorable

273
00:20:00 --> 00:20:04
state, the lowest energy state,
would be with those ends coming back

274
00:20:04 --> 00:20:08
together.  So,
we could then add DNA ligase.

275
00:20:08 --> 00:20:12
If we added these up and added DNA
ligase, we could reverse the process

276
00:20:12 --> 00:20:16
and go back and forth,
ECO-R1 to cut it, DNA to ligate it.

277
00:20:16 --> 00:20:23
And then, the beauty of recombinant
DNA is this rejoining part doesn't

278
00:20:23 --> 00:20:30
see what's out here or
what's out there.

279
00:20:30 --> 00:20:34
All it sees is the little ends that
are generated by an ECO-R1 site.

280
00:20:34 --> 00:20:38
So they take some of my DNA, and
I'll cut it up.

281
00:20:38 --> 00:20:42
I'll get a zillion ECO-R1 fragments,
but they'll all have the same little

282
00:20:42 --> 00:20:47
overhanging bit that's complementary
to the vector.

283
00:20:47 --> 00:20:51
So if I take a vector cut with
ECO-R1, and I take some of my own

284
00:20:51 --> 00:20:55
DNA and I mix them,
I can get a little fragment,

285
00:20:55 --> 00:20:59
get in between the vector, and it
does exactly that joining that I was

286
00:20:59 --> 00:21:04
diagramming right here.
So again, it was the discovery of

287
00:21:04 --> 00:21:10
these restriction enzymes that made
possible almost all the stuff that's

288
00:21:10 --> 00:21:16
happened in biology since 1975.
The development of restriction

289
00:21:16 --> 00:21:21
enzymes was essentially,
I was a postdoc at Berkeley at that

290
00:21:21 --> 00:21:27
point and the labs,
Stan Cohen at Stanford,

291
00:21:27 --> 00:21:33
Herb Boyer at UCSF, and a two others
around the country were

292
00:21:33 --> 00:21:37
working on this.
They were almost all labs that had

293
00:21:37 --> 00:21:41
worked on bacterial plasmids.
Plasmids are little circles of DNA,

294
00:21:41 --> 00:21:45
so the labs that started were ones
who have been busy studying little

295
00:21:45 --> 00:21:49
circles of DNA that usually carry
drug-resistances between cells.

296
00:21:49 --> 00:21:53
And so that was happening while I
was a postdoc.

297
00:21:53 --> 00:21:57
And when I got to MIT and '76 the
technology was just beginning.

298
00:21:57 --> 00:22:01
I was one of the first labs trying
to cut pieces of DNA and join

299
00:22:01 --> 00:22:04
them back together.
So, it's a pretty recent development.

300
00:22:04 --> 00:22:08
At that point,
DNA sequencing hadn't been invented.

301
00:22:08 --> 00:22:12
The idea that you could pull out a
piece of DNA and do something with

302
00:22:12 --> 00:22:16
it or produce a protein was just a
thought.  It didn't exist.

303
00:22:16 --> 00:22:19
So it's hard to overemphasize how
critical the discovery of these

304
00:22:19 --> 00:22:23
restriction enzymes were.
Now, I just want to tell you where

305
00:22:23 --> 00:22:27
they came from,
or how people found them.

306
00:22:27 --> 00:22:31
And they'll try and do this quickly
because I know some of you get

307
00:22:31 --> 00:22:35
impatient with history.
But this is really important because

308
00:22:35 --> 00:22:39
it's very easy to make fun of basic
research.  You can ridicule anything

309
00:22:39 --> 00:22:43
pretty easily,
and you might just ask because I'm

310
00:22:43 --> 00:22:47
telling you the story.
Somebody proposed doing this.

311
00:22:47 --> 00:22:51
I'm going to tell you the
experiment that basically is the

312
00:22:51 --> 00:22:55
basis of the biotech industry,
and would you have been smart enough

313
00:22:55 --> 00:22:59
to recognize that it was the
discovery of a phenomenon called

314
00:22:59 --> 00:23:03
restriction, restriction in
bacteriophage growth on bacteria?

315
00:23:03 --> 00:23:06
And it was, here are actually a
couple of EM's and these little

316
00:23:06 --> 00:23:10
plasmids.  This is an electron
micrograph one.

317
00:23:10 --> 00:23:14
In these little circles it's been
shadowed.  And this is actually

318
00:23:14 --> 00:23:18
artificially colored,
but that was the kind of plasmids

319
00:23:18 --> 00:23:22
that people were cutting up.
So, as I said, trying to get

320
00:23:22 --> 00:23:26
through this DNA,
and the stuff, what's made possible

321
00:23:26 --> 00:23:30
the sequencing at the Whitehead
Genome Center and stuff that I'll

322
00:23:30 --> 00:23:33
tell you about is going on.
I didn't really set this one up.

323
00:23:33 --> 00:23:37
But that's Eric Lander who teaches
701 in the fall.

324
00:23:37 --> 00:23:40
I told you a picture from that DNA
50th.  Well, they had a banquet at

325
00:23:40 --> 00:23:44
the end of it,
and I was there.

326
00:23:44 --> 00:23:47
This is [Savandi Pabo?
from Europe who is sequencing the

327
00:23:47 --> 00:23:51
chimp genome.  And that's Francis
Collins who is head of the entire

328
00:23:51 --> 00:23:54
Human Genome Project.
This is Evelyn Witkin,

329
00:23:54 --> 00:23:58
who was a big discoverer of early
DNA repair events.

330
00:23:58 --> 00:24:02
And I put that one in because it
was sort of interesting.

331
00:24:02 --> 00:24:05
There was Eric,
and Savandi, and Francis were

332
00:24:05 --> 00:24:08
talking about what would happen when
they knew the sequence of the chimp

333
00:24:08 --> 00:24:11
genome, which wasn't done.
And there was an advertisement,

334
00:24:11 --> 00:24:14
a poster advertising Jim Watson's
latest book.  And they ripped that

335
00:24:14 --> 00:24:17
in half, and were writing notes on
the back all the way through dinner.

336
00:24:17 --> 00:24:20
So if you want to see what
scientists on the cutting edge,

337
00:24:20 --> 00:24:24
including someone who teaches 701
the fall looks like when they are

338
00:24:24 --> 00:24:27
not teaching 701,
there is a picture.

339
00:24:27 --> 00:24:30
So anyway, the discovery of
restriction enzymes was Salvador

340
00:24:30 --> 00:24:34
Luria, who I've mentioned.
He was a member of the biology

341
00:24:34 --> 00:24:38
department, and one of our Nobel
Prize winners.

342
00:24:38 --> 00:24:42
He started the cancer center.
He also trained at Jim Watson,

343
00:24:42 --> 00:24:46
when I showed you that picture.
This is Salvador standing over here.

344
00:24:46 --> 00:24:50
Another thing that Salvador did, he
was a Nobel Prize winner but he

345
00:24:50 --> 00:24:54
thought introductory biology.
So I am basically following in the

346
00:24:54 --> 00:24:58
footsteps of Salvador.
He wrote a book called,

347
00:24:58 --> 00:25:02
even though he was a Nobel Prize
winner, a book called 36 lectures in

348
00:25:02 --> 00:25:06
introductory biology.
And some universities,

349
00:25:06 --> 00:25:10
the intro to biology is taught by
whoever is at the bottom of the food

350
00:25:10 --> 00:25:15
chain.  The most junior professor
gets stuck with intro to biology.

351
00:25:15 --> 00:25:19
And here it's the other way.  I
mean you're getting Eric and Bob,

352
00:25:19 --> 00:25:24
for example, Weinberg to teach in
the fall, tells you that.

353
00:25:24 --> 00:25:28
And really where that comes from is
the fact that Salvador Luria had

354
00:25:28 --> 00:25:32
such an interest in replication.
So he trained at Jim Watson,

355
00:25:32 --> 00:25:35
started the cancer center here,
and he also carried out this

356
00:25:35 --> 00:25:39
phenomenon of restriction.
And to get this working with

357
00:25:39 --> 00:25:42
bacteriophage.
And I know a [couple he wrote?

358
00:25:42 --> 00:25:45
, he didn't like to see old guys on
porches.  So I got freaked out,

359
00:25:45 --> 00:25:48
and I took this next picture out for
this morning.  Oh,

360
00:25:48 --> 00:25:51
I've got to show it anyway for two
reasons.  This is Salvador sitting

361
00:25:51 --> 00:25:55
on a porch at Cold Spring Harbor
with Max Delbrook who started,

362
00:25:55 --> 00:25:58
really, much of the work on
bacteriophage that gave us the

363
00:25:58 --> 00:26:01
underpinnings of microbiology.
And then put it partly on A because

364
00:26:01 --> 00:26:04
it shows the informality of the
molecular biology culture which

365
00:26:04 --> 00:26:08
persists to this day,
and also because Salvador had such

366
00:26:08 --> 00:26:11
an impish sense of humor.
You would have really enjoyed had

367
00:26:11 --> 00:26:14
he been teaching this course.
Anyway, Salvador was studying this

368
00:26:14 --> 00:26:18
bacteriophage.
Remember we talked about it?

369
00:26:18 --> 00:26:21
And they basically [with syringe?
they injected their DNA into the

370
00:26:21 --> 00:26:24
cell.  There's an electron
micrograph.  The DNA is up top there.

371
00:26:24 --> 00:26:28
It goes in, and then the DNA takes
over the cell,

372
00:26:28 --> 00:26:32
reprograms it, and makes babyphage.
And I showed you how we make plaques.

373
00:26:32 --> 00:26:38
So that was what Salvador was
studying.  And it's a little like

374
00:26:38 --> 00:26:44
what we are talking about with
Mendel.  He didn't have very many

375
00:26:44 --> 00:26:49
techniques available to him at the
time.  He couldn't sequence DNA.

376
00:26:49 --> 00:26:55
He couldn't do a lot of things.
But he could [plate phage?

377
00:26:55 --> 00:27:01
and count, and things like that.
And what Salvador was looking at,

378
00:27:01 --> 00:27:07
he had a bacteriophage, and he had
two strains of bacteria.

379
00:27:07 --> 00:27:13
I'll call them A and B.
OK, here comes the experiment that

380
00:27:13 --> 00:27:20
founded the biotech industry.
You ready?  You going to fund me?

381
00:27:20 --> 00:27:27
All right, so what I propose doing
is I'm going to grow the phage on

382
00:27:27 --> 00:27:34
strain A, and  now I'm going to
plate on strain A and strain B.

383
00:27:34 --> 00:27:38
I laid awake all last week thinking
of this experiment.

384
00:27:38 --> 00:27:43
So what did I get?  I got a lot of
plaques on strain A,

385
00:27:43 --> 00:27:48
probably something like 109 or 1010
per mil because that's what this

386
00:27:48 --> 00:27:52
phage lysate usually looks like once
you've grown them up.

387
00:27:52 --> 00:27:57
And if I plate them over on strain
B, no phage, maybe an

388
00:27:57 --> 00:28:02
occasional phage.
So, I bristly the bacteriophage can

389
00:28:02 --> 00:28:08
grow mine on strain A.
It can't grow on strain B most of

390
00:28:08 --> 00:28:13
the time, but some variant has
managed to figure out how to grow on

391
00:28:13 --> 00:28:18
strain B.  Give our foray into
genetics, I think many of you would

392
00:28:18 --> 00:28:24
think, probably as I suspect
Salvador did at the time,

393
00:28:24 --> 00:28:29
the things mutated.  It's learned.
It's made some change in its

394
00:28:29 --> 00:28:34
genomes that's allowed it to grow on
strain B.  So,

395
00:28:34 --> 00:28:40
I wonder if it learned to grow on
strain B, couldn't

396
00:28:40 --> 00:28:47
grow on strain A?
So, basically what he took was the

397
00:28:47 --> 00:28:57
phage from that experiment,
and then he plated them on strain A

398
00:28:57 --> 00:29:04
and strain B.
And, well, as you might guess,

399
00:29:04 --> 00:29:10
since it was growing on strain B,
lots of plaques, and there were lots

400
00:29:10 --> 00:29:15
of plaques over here.
OK, so it didn't forget how to grow

401
00:29:15 --> 00:29:20
on strain A.  So,
better check over here,

402
00:29:20 --> 00:29:26
too, need a control experiment,
so take this guy, plate it out,

403
00:29:26 --> 00:29:31
strain A, strain B,
some plaques over here.

404
00:29:31 --> 00:29:37
That's not a surprise going in
strain A.

405
00:29:37 --> 00:29:42
We are back to where we started from.
It doesn't sound like a mutant,

406
00:29:42 --> 00:29:47
does it?  And if it was a mutant,
everybody should have been the same.

407
00:29:47 --> 00:29:53
Instead, when you grew a phage on
strain A, it didn't have the ability

408
00:29:53 --> 00:29:58
to grow on strain B.
But if you gave it a chance to grow

409
00:29:58 --> 00:30:04
on strain B, most of them
wouldn't make it.

410
00:30:04 --> 00:30:09
But if it ever did,
it had now acquired the ability to

411
00:30:09 --> 00:30:15
grow on strain B.
So it could still grow on both.

412
00:30:15 --> 00:30:21
But if you take somebody who had
been growing, something had been

413
00:30:21 --> 00:30:27
growing at strain A,
it lost it.  And so, the idea there

414
00:30:27 --> 00:30:33
was then that it wasn't a mutation.
Something was happening in the

415
00:30:33 --> 00:30:39
strain B that enabled it
to grow on strain B.

416
00:30:39 --> 00:30:43
And if it ever got away from that
environment, [it?

417
00:30:43 --> 00:30:48
lost it.  So, the phenomenon was
called restriction.

418
00:30:48 --> 00:30:53
It wasn't a mutation.
It was something else.

419
00:30:53 --> 00:30:58
And it turned out, then,
that restriction was due to an

420
00:30:58 --> 00:31:04
enzyme.
An example of this kind of thing,

421
00:31:04 --> 00:31:11
then, would be this ECO-R1 activity
that's able to cut at a very

422
00:31:11 --> 00:31:18
specific sequence.
Now, if you are going to have a set

423
00:31:18 --> 00:31:25
of molecular scissors inside of you
that could cut a G A T C sequences,

424
00:31:25 --> 00:31:32
you'd have a problem unless you did
something else because every one of

425
00:31:32 --> 00:31:39
your G A T C sequences would be cut
by the restriction enzymes.

426
00:31:39 --> 00:31:46
So what the cells that have a
restriction enzyme have,

427
00:31:46 --> 00:31:54
as a modification enzyme that
recognizes the same sequence,

428
00:31:54 --> 00:32:02
and then modifies it in some way
that makes it resistant to the

429
00:32:02 --> 00:32:09
restriction enzyme.
And in the case of the ECO-R1,

430
00:32:09 --> 00:32:15
it puts on a methyl group on this A.
You might have thought that that

431
00:32:15 --> 00:32:22
would interfere with base pairing,
but it doesn't because adenine looks

432
00:32:22 --> 00:32:29
like this.  These are the guys that
do the base pair refining,

433
00:32:29 --> 00:32:35
if you look back, and you'll see
that you could put a methyl

434
00:32:35 --> 00:32:41
group in there.
It wouldn't interfere with the base

435
00:32:41 --> 00:32:45
pairing, but would allow this to go.
So, it was the discovery of this

436
00:32:45 --> 00:32:49
phenomenon of restriction of
bacteriophage grew on one strain,

437
00:32:49 --> 00:32:53
not on another.  It could learn to
grow on the other strain.

438
00:32:53 --> 00:32:57
It could lose that acquisition.
It was that phenomenon.  People,

439
00:32:57 --> 00:33:01
didn't have any other reason other
than it was an interesting problem

440
00:33:01 --> 00:33:05
in biology to understand it.
Once they understood the basis of it,

441
00:33:05 --> 00:33:09
another whole world opened up
because you could see from basic

442
00:33:09 --> 00:33:13
principles, now I could cut any
piece of DNA.  I could generate

443
00:33:13 --> 00:33:16
these little overhanging sticky ends.
I could take a plasmid.

444
00:33:16 --> 00:33:20
People knew about those.
I could find one that only has one

445
00:33:20 --> 00:33:24
restriction site.
I could stick things in.

446
00:33:24 --> 00:33:28
Now I've attached an origin of
replication to each of those pieces.

447
00:33:28 --> 00:33:32
And I'm in business.
I can now, for the first time ever,

448
00:33:32 --> 00:33:38
take a particular piece of DNA and
make as many copies as I want.

449
00:33:38 --> 00:33:44
And that was an absolute
transformation to the way people

450
00:33:44 --> 00:33:50
were able to think about biology.
So I'm going to just kind of give

451
00:33:50 --> 00:33:56
you an idea of how people would
start.  So the way people began and

452
00:33:56 --> 00:34:02
still began most things is they'd
call it, the usual term is you call

453
00:34:02 --> 00:34:08
constructing a recombinant
DNA library.

454
00:34:08 --> 00:34:17
And there are a variety of different
ways of doing this.

455
00:34:17 --> 00:34:26
But this principle is the same.
We'd take the DNA from whatever

456
00:34:26 --> 00:34:36
organism you're interested
in, [and studying?].

457
00:34:36 --> 00:34:43
And we cut with some restriction
enzyme.  And this restriction enzyme

458
00:34:43 --> 00:34:51
will cut wherever there happened to
be sites.  They might be close

459
00:34:51 --> 00:34:59
together.  They might be far apart.
But whatever, still generate some

460
00:34:59 --> 00:35:05
characteristic set of fragments.
And we'll now have,

461
00:35:05 --> 00:35:09
in this case, fragment number one,
fragment number two, fragment number

462
00:35:09 --> 00:35:13
three, fragment number four,
and so on.  And if it's my DNA,

463
00:35:13 --> 00:35:18
there's a lot of fragments.  And of
course, they're all mixed up.

464
00:35:18 --> 00:35:22
I can't tell where any of them are.
They're just all mixed together in

465
00:35:22 --> 00:35:26
the test tube.
Then we'll take that vector that

466
00:35:26 --> 00:35:31
we've opened.
And now, we'll mix all of these

467
00:35:31 --> 00:35:37
fragments together with this vector.
And then we join it just the way

468
00:35:37 --> 00:35:43
[that it's cut?
.  And now what we'll get,

469
00:35:43 --> 00:35:49
it's a collection of plasmids that
have different inserts.

470
00:35:49 --> 00:35:55
So, one of the plasmids will have
that fragment number one.

471
00:35:55 --> 00:36:01
Another one of them will have
fragment number two, number

472
00:36:01 --> 00:36:06
three, and so on.
Then this whole thing is what's

473
00:36:06 --> 00:36:11
known as a library.
You can see if it's DNA from me,

474
00:36:11 --> 00:36:17
there were 3 billion base pairs to
start.  Given the human DNA,

475
00:36:17 --> 00:36:22
G A T C sequences are pretty common.
You can calculate the frequency

476
00:36:22 --> 00:36:27
yourself for how many sites on
average there would be for a

477
00:36:27 --> 00:36:32
restriction enzyme within a piece of
DNA and figure out roughly how the

478
00:36:32 --> 00:36:38
fragments there would be in the
library of human DNA.

479
00:36:38 --> 00:36:42
So, we are partway there.
We can now make a library.

480
00:36:42 --> 00:36:46
We can make it from bacterial DNA.
We can make it from human DNA.  But

481
00:36:46 --> 00:36:51
the next thing that people had to
learn how to do was to figure out

482
00:36:51 --> 00:36:55
how to find a particular fragment
that had the gene that you

483
00:36:55 --> 00:36:59
are interested in.
And there's a whole variety of

484
00:36:59 --> 00:37:02
things.  I mean,
ultimately today since the human

485
00:37:02 --> 00:37:06
genome is sequenced,
you go on a computer and a type and

486
00:37:06 --> 00:37:09
you find it because the sequence is
all known.  But the only reason we

487
00:37:09 --> 00:37:12
can do that is because of all the
work that was done in between.

488
00:37:12 --> 00:37:15
So, I'll give you several ways of
doing this.  But one of the ways I

489
00:37:15 --> 00:37:18
think you can see very easily,
and it's actually going back to the

490
00:37:18 --> 00:37:22
term complementation.
Remember complementation?

491
00:37:22 --> 00:37:25
We had something that was mutant,
and then we'd put in a wild type

492
00:37:25 --> 00:37:29
gene, and fixed it up again.
So, for example,

493
00:37:29 --> 00:37:33
suppose I was studying histidine
biosynthesis in E.

494
00:37:33 --> 00:37:38
coli, and I wanted to find the gene
that encoded the enzyme that I had

495
00:37:38 --> 00:37:43
just disabled in my histidine minus
mutant.  So, if I have a

496
00:37:43 --> 00:37:47
[hisoxotroph?],
I'll call it a [his G?

497
00:37:47 --> 00:37:52
gene, for example, that's one of
the genes involved in making

498
00:37:52 --> 00:37:57
histidine.  So,
since it's a histidine auxotroph,

499
00:37:57 --> 00:38:01
if I have it on just minimal glucose
plates, and I streak it out,

500
00:38:01 --> 00:38:07
it's not going to grow.
But if I grow it on minimal glucose

501
00:38:07 --> 00:38:13
plus histidine,
then it will be able to grow,

502
00:38:13 --> 00:38:19
right?  So, I've got a variant of
this organism.

503
00:38:19 --> 00:38:25
It's got a single mutation in it
that's affecting one gene.

504
00:38:25 --> 00:38:31
And because I don't have that gene,
I can't grow on minimal.

505
00:38:31 --> 00:38:35
If I made a library of E.
coli DNA, which is going to have a

506
00:38:35 --> 00:38:40
lot of fragments as well,
and I took that library and I put it

507
00:38:40 --> 00:38:45
into this mutant,
I'm going to get a big mess of

508
00:38:45 --> 00:38:49
things, all the different plasmids
with all the different fragments

509
00:38:49 --> 00:38:54
that go into that mutant.
How am I going to find the one that

510
00:38:54 --> 00:38:59
I want?  Anybody see that?
It's not that hard.  I'm the mutant.

511
00:38:59 --> 00:39:04
I can't grow on minimal because I
can't make this enzyme.

512
00:39:04 --> 00:39:09
Therefore, I can't make histidine.
What do I need?  How could you fix

513
00:39:09 --> 00:39:14
me up if you were a doctor?
What's the gene we want out of here?

514
00:39:14 --> 00:39:20
The one that makes that particular
enzyme that makes histidine.

515
00:39:20 --> 00:39:25
Yeah, take the whole library,
stick it in this mutant.  If the

516
00:39:25 --> 00:39:31
gene coming in encodes DNA
polymerase, I'm not going

517
00:39:31 --> 00:39:36
to help this guy.
It still won't grow in minimal,

518
00:39:36 --> 00:39:42
take a gene involved in making part
of the cell wall would help.

519
00:39:42 --> 00:39:48
But if I put in the, I get a
fragment of DNA that includes the

520
00:39:48 --> 00:39:53
his G plus gene,
and I put it in here,

521
00:39:53 --> 00:39:59
it's going to grow up.
If it has the plasmid that has,

522
00:39:59 --> 00:40:05
or let's say the vector that has the
his G plus gene.

523
00:40:05 --> 00:40:08
So what you've done is a really,
sort of, you've used that principle

524
00:40:08 --> 00:40:12
of complementation that some of you
were sort of wondering about when we

525
00:40:12 --> 00:40:16
were doing genetics.
So, you'd break a copy of a gene.

526
00:40:16 --> 00:40:20
In the things we talked about, we
bring in a whole chromosome that

527
00:40:20 --> 00:40:24
included in it just a wild type copy
of the gene.  With recombinant DNA,

528
00:40:24 --> 00:40:28
we can really narrow it down in the
extreme.  We can bring in a piece of

529
00:40:28 --> 00:40:32
DNA that is only the gene
that's broken.

530
00:40:32 --> 00:40:36
And we can take the gene back to the
wild type.  One thing,

531
00:40:36 --> 00:40:41
just to close, you'll see,
if you remember back when I talked

532
00:40:41 --> 00:40:45
about language that are not
universal, although the genetic code

533
00:40:45 --> 00:40:50
is universal, promoters and things
are not.  So I couldn't ever do this

534
00:40:50 --> 00:40:54
with a human DNA,
could I, because it wouldn't get

535
00:40:54 --> 00:40:59
expressed.  So,
we need some other ways of finding

536
00:40:59 --> 00:41:02
those.  We'll talk about those on
the next lecture, OK?
