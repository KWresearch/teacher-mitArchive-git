<p></p>
<p>OK, so I'd like to go now to the next segment of the course. Think  you can probably appreciate little bit better this triangle I had on  before about how what biochemists did was they tended to break cells  open, look at the component parts, through other things in there, and  then proteins. But an awful lot of stuff having to do with function is  proteins, and what geneticists, the discipline of genetics would do,  which made mutants of living organisms, and that looked at how function  was affected by mutating individual genes, how those were both very  powerful approaches.</p>
<p>Genetics told you what was really important,  and biochemistry told you how it worked at a molecular level, but the  real problem is knowing whether this thing you had doing something in  the test tube was actually the one that did it in life. And I think I  told you when Arthur Kornberg isolated the very first DNA polymerase, he  was able to copy DNA. And he got a Nobel prize, and it was the first  enzyme that could copy DNA, and then John Karens made a mutant that was  lacking the enzyme.</p>
<p>And the organism was still alive. So  therefore, it couldn't have been the DNA polymerase that was copying the  chromosome. It actually turned out to be a DNA repair enzyme. So, if  you can actually unite genetics and biochemistry, if you can take a  mutant that's broken in a function and you found your protein was  missing, or vice versa, then you had a very, very powerful insight  because you connect your knowledge of what was physiologically important  to the biochemistry that you're doing.</p>
<p>But it was really, really  hard for years, and only in very rare occasions did some geneticists  have a mutant that suggests so strongly that some biochemists would  look, or some biochemists would have such a powerful result that they  talked to a geneticist and see if anybody had found the result. And the  power of recombinant DNA, although it started a biotech industry, and it  made possible the sequencing of the genome, there's another level up  one higher in conceptual understanding.</p>
<p>And what it did was, it  let you go back and forth between here and here. You wouldn't have any  problem now if I gave you the sequence of the gene, you can order it.  You could stick it in a cell and make massive amounts of the protein.  You purified it twenty-fold and it would be pure, whereas before you  might have had to purified it fifteen thousand-fold out of 1,000 g of  cells, and you would have had to been a very good biochemists with 15  steps in order to purify it.</p>
<p>So, you can go from the sequence of  the gene to the protein, or if we got a protein and we wanted to know  which gene we'd just sequence a bit of the protein, use that genetic  code, work ourselves backwards to some possible sequences, then go  looking for the sequences, and then go find the gene. So, what  recombinant DNA allows us to do is close that loop.</p>
<p>You can go  from genetics to biochemistry and back and forth. Now everybody does  everything instead of it being isolated disciplines, which it was when I  entered the field. So, all of the stuff depended on the development to  clone particular pieces of DNA. And I want to make clear right at the  beginning, there's a couple of uses of cloning that are in popular usage  right now.</p>
<p>What we're talking about in this lecture is cloning a  piece of DNA. What that means, is I'm going to take a particular segment  of DNA, say, cut it here, and cut it there. And I'm going to take that  piece, and I'm going to do something to it that lets me amplify it and  make many, many copies of that piece of DNA. And cloning of anything  else you make a whole lot of copies. So that's one use of the word  cloning.</p>
<p>The other use, which you see in the popular press all the  time, is cloning an individual, thought being there: you would take the  nucleus from the cell of the individual, put that nucleus into an egg  that didn't have its own nucleus moved, and now you hope what you get  out of that is an organism that has all the same genetic content as the  starting individual. And in fact, although it sounds very good in paper,  is you're probably beginning to see it's not the panacea that people  thought it was, or that we'd have to worry that in 10 years, all of my  MIT students would be clones of the brightest person in the class or  anything like that, because other stuff happens, that you get to in  advanced biology courses, but there are modifications of DNA.</p>
<p>There's  all sorts of stuff that happens to it, so it's not identical. And so  many of these cloned organisms, like Dolly the sheep, that was famous,  died early with, I forget, arthritis and things. So, there are a lot of  problems on that score. But that's the other use of the word cloning and  that's not what these next three lectures that we are talking about  cloning a piece of DNA.</p>
<p>And that was the big problem that faced  the field, certainly when I was an undergrad and even when I was a grad  student I was interested in synthesizing pieces of DNA, and it was one  of those things that people said, why are you doing it? Well, because  you could try to do it. What if you got a piece of DNA, like Gobind  Khorana, who's my colleague, who got the Nobel prize for synthesizing  the first gene.</p>
<p>He synthesized it. It was a tRNA gene that was 120  nucleotide base pairs long or something. He synthesized it. He'd shown  you could do it. But you couldn't do anything with it. And there were  sort of two big problems. One was the fact that this DNA, although it's  not a monotonous tetranucleotide. It's pretty hard to tell. Each one of  these things is a base pair, and human DNA has 3 billion of those. And a  bit down here, doesn't look very different than the bit out there.</p>
<p>And  it certainly wouldn't looks very different than the bit of DNA that's 2  billion base pairs over on the other side of campus or something. So,  there is no way to take DNA and cut it reproducibly, so you to get  fragments. What you could see from first principles was what you would  need was magic scissors. And what would the scissors look like? Well, it  would have to be scissors that could read a sequence as there's nothing  else different.</p>
<p>You know it's a regular backbone, and it's only  four nucleotides. So, if you wanted to cut DNA in particular places, you  had to have scissors that could see a sequence. And furthermore, you  can see they couldn't just, there are the hydrogen bonding parts of A  and T or G and C because those are stuck together there in the middle of  the DNA. So, you'd need scissors that could somehow find a sequence and  make a cut.</p>
<p>And those were found. I'm going to till you about  those. They're called restriction enzymes. So that was part of the  thing. The other thing was, imagine I could cut out this fragment. And  they gave it to you, and I said, great. Now I've got it. Would you make  me a lot of copies of this DNA? Could you do that? Let's say, you now  know how to transform the principle that we saw back with Avery.</p>
<p>We  could take naked DNA and put this fragment into the cell. Would it  replicate? What do you think? Anybody remember? No? OK, we talked about  some other languages, right? But one of the things that's in the DNA is  the genetic code with all the genes. And we can find the reading frame.  Remember when we talked about an origin of replication. I said that was  sort of, at least for E.</p>
<p>coli there's one origin. In eukaryotes  the origins are spaced out along the DNA. And every time you have a  round of replication, it starts with one of those origins and then goes.  So the chance of this piece of DNA by chance is going to have an origin  is pretty small. So if I put it into an organism, it's going to sit  there, if you're lucky, maybe degraded because it's got blunt ends, or  even if I made it into circle it probably wouldn't replicate because it  probably doesn't have the word in the DNA that says "start a round of  DNA replication".</p>
<p>So, the other overarching principle of DNA  replication is you somehow have to take the fragment of DNA that you're  looking at, and you have to attach it to an origin of replication. Now,  if you have an origin of replication and you have a fragment of DNA, and  you put it in the cell, now you'll get a lot of copies of that piece of  DNA. So that's what recombinant DNA is all about in a really, really  simple form.</p>
<p>I'm just going to take you now into increasing sort  of levels of detail. So, let me just sort of give you just sort of a  really broad view of this cloning, and then we'll sort of start to dive  in to some of the fancier techniques that have come out of this. We'll  talk about DNA sequencing, and PCR, and stuff in the next lecture. So  the first principle here is to cut the DNA, and I know you may think  this is sort of baby talk, but this is how I think.</p>
<p>If you really  think about this stuff, this is what it really is. With sequence  specific molecular scissors, these have the rather odd name. They're  called restriction enzymes. I don't know if any of you know why they're  called restriction enzymes, and although I'm sure that some of you have  used them in your UROP to cut up pieces of DNA. But what that does,  these are enzymes, as I'll tell you, that recognize a particular  sequence.</p>
<p>And they always cut at that sequence. The value of that  is you can reproducibly cut DNA exactly the same spot, and the spots are  specified by whatever sequence that particular pair of scissors knows  how to read. Then the next thing we have to do is we need to join the  piece of DNA to an origin of replication. So the thing that carries the  origin of replication is called a vector. And usually, not always, these  are circles.</p>
<p>We'll consider the ones that grow in E. coli are  most of the time, or in bacteria, mostly circles. They are the ones that  are broadly used for most cloning. So, we'll talk about those. What  makes a vector? What it has to have is an origin of DNA replication.  They usually have something else. We could call it a selectable marker,  but something like a drug resistance.</p>
<p>If any of you have done  cloning in a UROP usually it's something like a gene for making the cell  ampicillin resistant, or tetracycline resistant, some antibiotic that  would normally kill the cell. So you can tell, does that cell have that  vector or not because the cell starts out ampicillin sensitive but it  acquires the vector that's replicating it, also acquires the gene that  gives it the drug resistance.</p>
<p>But if we're going to cut that, if  we're going to join a piece of DNA to that, we can't join into a circle  without breaking it. So, we need to cut the vector at a unique site. And  we would use a restriction enzyme for that. And you can also see in  designing a vector, you'd want something that only has one site. So,  what we would have achieved from this conceptually as we've now got  this, this is the vector, its origin of replication here, and let's say  ampicillin resistance, for example, as a selectable marker, the gene for  that could be encoded here.</p>
<p>And we have the fragment of, if you  want to that down, just put it down on the floor, I think. We've made  the point at this stage. Thanks. What one has to do is to join this  piece of DNA to that. And we'll go to the molecular details of this.  But, we'll join the fragment to the vector, and actually this was  something that was already in molecular biologists' toolkits, have been  studying DNA replication.</p>
<p>That's DNA ligase. When we finish an  Okazaki fragment, we had to seal nicks and the enzyme that did that was  an enzyme called DNA ligase. So, molecular biologists basically had the  scotch tape or the glue to join stuff back together. What they were  missing for many, many years where the sequence- specific molecular  scissors. So at this stage, if we were doing the recombinant DNA, we now  have a vector.</p>
<p>We now have a piece of DNA joined to it. In fact,  we probably have a whole other mess of things that happens along the  way. But at the moment, they're in a test tube. So, if we want to have  this thing grow, what do we have to do next? We are going to have to get  the DNA from outside the cell inside the cell. That's the word; we need  to transform the DNA into a cell.</p>
<p>Again, the word transform, that  goes back to those transformation experiments with the Streptococcus  pneumonia going from smooth to rough, and you are taking stuff from the  cell that transformed them from rough to smooth, whatever, that's where  the word came from, but we now know it's getting naked DNA inside the  cell where it can be replicated. And then the next thing we need to know  is, what cells have acquired this vector that at least has the vector.</p>
<p>We'll  settle for that in the beginning, and to do that, you need to select  for the marker on the vector. In the case of this one, we would start  with a strain that's killed by ampicillin, and then we just plate it out  and ask for guys that are ampicillin resistant. And, you can see that  there is another class of problem because if we had uncut vector, and  there would probably be, for sure, some of that in our mix, that would  make the cell amp resistant.</p>
<p>And if we had an insert, it would be  amp resistant. So, if we really wanted to get into this, we'd have to do  some more work to sort out what's on there. But that's the basic stuff.  I suspect most of you know this practically since kindergarten. But  that's the overall framework into which, now, I'm going to start  layering different pieces of detail. And the next part, again, some of  you may know.</p>
<p>I don't think it will be a totally foreign concept.  You are probably familiar with this, that what are these restriction  enzymes? The actual word is restriction endonuclease. They are often  usually called restriction enzymes in a lab parlance. Nuclease is  something that cuts the nucleic acid, and endonuclease is one that  doesn't need a free end. So, it can cut in the middle of the sequence  instead of nibbling at the end.</p>
<p>That would be an exonuclease. So,  these things have names that tend to be something like EcoRI, which has  something to do with where they are derived from. And a typical one, one  of the very first ones that is still in really wide use, is EcoRI. And  this recognizes the sequence G A A T T C. Now, you'll notice that if you  read the sequence in this way it's the same sequence when you read it  on the other strand.</p>
<p>It's called a palindrome but be careful  because palindromes in English, those are words that you read from the  front to the back; they're the same. In an English letter, it doesn't  matter whether it's in A here or an A there. But you guys know something  about DNA structure. There's a five to three prime polarity. So,  reading this way doesn't look at all the same.</p>
<p>It's totally  different. But reading in this strand, we say that's five to three. The  thing that's identical is the reciprocal sequence on the other side. So  there is this, you see G A A and G A A but it's not like the English  word palindrome, so don't get yourself mixed up about that. Anyway, what  this will then, what this enzyme then does, is it cuts to the side  here. It cuts symmetrically.</p>
<p>And what it generates then is a G  three prime hydroxyl. Remember the ribose? If we have, say, an A there,  this is the three prime position, and that's the five prime position in  the sugar. So, it leaves a three prime hydroxyl, and is also then leaves  a five prime phosphate. So, we'd have A A T T C here, and then on the  other side, we would get the reciprocal thing. So, we'd have G with a  three prime hydroxyl, and then over A A T T C like that.</p>
<p>So now  we've got a break here. We can pull those apart. But one of the nice  things you can see right from this is that we're generating five prime  single stranded ends, and this one is the sequence A A T T C. This is A A  T T C here, and these guys, if they could get together and line up as  they would here, they'd be able to form hydrogen bonds. So, if you take  an enzyme like EcoRI, and we took, let's say, a circle that had a single  EcoRI site, G A A T T C, if we cut it with the restriction enzyme we  would make nicks.</p>
<p>And if we kept it cold, all that we'd have is  DNA nicks. And if we warm things up a little bit, there's only four  hydrogen bonds that are holding that together. So, the thing would  linearize and just flop around in the breeze. If we cooled it slowly,  the thermodynamically most favorable state, the lowest energy state,  would be with those ends coming back together.</p>
<p>So, we could then  add DNA ligase. If we added these up and added DNA ligase, we could  reverse the process and go back and forth, EcoRI to cut it, ligase to  ligate. And then, the beauty of recombinant DNA is this rejoining part  doesn't see what's out here or what's out there. All it sees is the  little ends that are generated by an EcoRI site. So they take some of my  DNA, and I'll cut it up.</p>
<p>I'll get a zillion EcoRI fragments, but  they'll all have the same little overhanging bit that's complementary to  the vector. So if I take a vector cut with EcoRI, and I take some of my  own DNA and I mix them, I can get a little fragment, get in between the  vector, and it does exactly that joining that I was diagramming right  here. So again, it was the discovery of these restriction enzymes that  made possible almost all the stuff that's happened in biology since  1975.</p>
<p>The development of restriction enzymes was essentially, I  was a postdoc at Berkeley at that point and the labs, Stan Cohen at  Stanford, Herb Boyer at UCSF, and a two others around the country were  working on this. They were almost all labs that had worked on bacterial  plasmids. Plasmids are little circles of DNA, so the labs that started  were ones who have been busy studying little circles of DNA that usually  carry drug-resistance between cells.</p>
<p>And so that was happening  while I was a postdoc. And when I got to MIT in '76 the technology was  just beginning. I was one of the first labs trying to cut pieces of DNA  and join them back together. So, it's a pretty recent development. At  that point, DNA sequencing hadn't been invented. The idea that you could  pull out a piece of DNA and do something with it or produce a protein  was just a thought.</p>
<p>It didn't exist. So it's hard to overemphasize  how critical the discovery of these restriction enzymes were. Now, I  just want to tell you where they came from, or how people found them.  And I'll try and do this quickly because I know some of you get  impatient with history. But this is really important because it's very  easy to make fun of basic research. You can ridicule anything pretty  easily, and you might just ask because I'm telling you the story.</p>
<p>Somebody  proposed doing this. I'm going to tell you the experiment that  basically is the basis of the biotech industry, and would you have been  smart enough to recognize that it was the discovery of a phenomenon  called restriction, restriction of bacteriophage growth on bacteria? And  it was, here are actually a couple of EM's of these little plasmids.  This is an electron micrograph one.</p>
<p>In these little circles it's  been shadowed. And this is actually artificially colored, but that was  the kind of plasmids that people were cutting up. So, as I said, trying  to get through this DNA, and the stuff, what's made possible the  sequencing at the Whitehead Genome Center and stuff that I'll tell you  about is going on. I didn't really set this one up. But that's Eric  Lander who teaches 7.012 in the fall. I told you a picture from that DNA  50th.</p>
<p>Well, they had a banquet at the end of it, and I was there.  This is Svante Paabo from Europe who is sequencing the chimp genome.  And that's Francis Collins who is head of the entire Human Genome  Project. This is Evelyn Witkin, who was a big discoverer of early DNA  repair events. And I put that one in because it was sort of interesting.  There was Eric, and Savandi, and Francis were talking about what would  happen when they knew the sequence of the chimp genome, which wasn't  done.</p>
<p>And there was an advertisement, a poster advertising Jim  Watson's latest book. And they ripped that in half, and were writing  notes on the back all the way through dinner. So if you want to see what  scientists on the cutting edge, including someone who teaches 701 the  fall looks like when they are not teaching 701, there is a picture. So  anyway, the discovery of restriction enzymes was Salvador Luria, who  I've mentioned.</p>
<p>He was a member of the biology department, and one  of our Nobel Prize winners. He started the Cancer Center. He also  trained Jim Watson, when I showed you that picture. This is Salvador  standing over here. Another thing that Salvador did, he was a Nobel  Prize winner but he taught introductory biology. So I am basically  following in the footsteps of Salvador.</p>
<p>He wrote a book called,  even though he was a Nobel Prize winner, a book called "36 Lectures in  Introductory Biology. And some universities, the intro to biology is  taught by whoever is at the bottom of the food chain. The most junior  professor gets stuck with intro to biology. And here it's the other way.  I mean you're getting Eric and Bob, for example, Weinberg to teach in  the fall, tells you that.</p>
<p>And really where that comes from is the  fact that Salvador Luria had such an interest in replication. So he  trained Jim Watson, started the Cancer Center here, and he also carried  out this phenomenon of restriction. And he did this working with  bacteriophage. And I know some of you wrote, you don't like to see old  guys on porches. So I got freaked out, and I took this next picture out  for this morning.</p>
<p>Oh, I've got to show it anyway for two reasons.  This is Salvador sitting on a porch at Cold Spring Harbor with Max  Delbruck who started, really, much of the work on bacteriophage that  gave us the underpinnings of microbiology. And I put it partly on A)  because it shows the informality of the molecular biology culture which  persists to this day, and B) because Salvador had such an impish sense  of humor.</p>
<p>You would have really enjoyed had he been teaching this  course. Anyway, Salvador was studying just bacteriophage. Remember we  talked about it? And they're basically a syringe, they injected their  DNA into the cell. There's an electron micrograph. The DNA is up top  there. It goes in, and then the DNA takes over the cell, reprograms it,  and makes baby phage. And I showed you how we make plaques. So that was  what Salvador was studying.</p>
<p>And it's a little like what we are  talking about with Mendel. He didn't have very many techniques available  to him at the time. He couldn't sequence DNA. He couldn't do a lot of  things. But he could plate phage and count, and things like that. And  what Salvador was looking at, he had a bacteriophage, and he had two  strains of bacteria. I'll call them A and B. OK, here comes the  experiment that founded the biotech industry.</p>
<p>You ready? You going  to fund me? All right, so what I propose doing is I'm going to grow the  phage on strain A, and now I'm going to plate on strain A and strain B.  I laid awake all last week thinking of this experiment. So what did I  get? I got a lot of plaques on strain A, probably something like 10^9 or  10^10 per ml because that's what this phage lysate usually looks like  once you've grown them up.</p>
<p>And if I plate them over on strain B,  no phage, maybe an occasional phage. So, obvioulsy the bacteriophage can  grow fine on strain A. It can't grow on strain B most of the time, but  some variant has managed to figure out how to grow on strain B. Given  our foray into genetics, I think many of you would think, probably as I  suspect Salvador did at the time, the thing's mutated.</p>
<p>It's  learned. It's made some change in its genomes that's allowed it to grow  on strain B. So, I wonder if it learned to grow on strain B, could it  grow on strain A? So, basically what he took was the phage from that  experiment, and then he plated them on strain A and strain B. And, well,  as you might guess, since it was growing on strain B, lots of plaques,  and there were lots of plaques over here.</p>
<p>OK, so it didn't forget  how to grow on strain A. So, better check over here, too, need a control  experiment, so take this guy, plate it out, strain A, strain B, some  plaques over here. That's not a surprise going in strain A. We are back  to where we started from. It doesn't sound like a mutant, does it? And  if it was a mutant, everybody should have been the same.</p>
<p>Instead,  when you grew a phage on strain A, it didn't have the ability to grow on  strain B. But if you gave it a chance to grow on strain B, most of them  wouldn't make it. But if it ever did, it had now acquired the ability  to grow on strain B. So it could still grow on both. But if you take  somebody who had been growing, something had been growing on strain A,  it lost it. And so, the idea there was then that it wasn't a mutation.</p>
<p>Something  was happening in the strain B that enabled it to grow on strain B. And  if it ever got away from that environment, it lost it. So, the  phenomenon was called restriction. It wasn't a mutation. It was  something else. And it turned out, then, that restriction was due to an  enzyme. An example of this kind of thing, then, would be this EcoRI  activity that's able to cut at a very specific sequence.</p>
<p>Now, if  you are going to have a set of molecular scissors inside of you that  could cut at G A T C sequences, you'd have a problem unless you did  something else because every one of your G A T C sequences would be cut  by the restriction enzymes. So what the cells that have a restriction  enzyme have, is a modification enzyme that recognizes the same sequence,  and then modifies it in some way that makes it resistant to the  restriction enzyme.</p>
<p>And in the case of the EcoRI, it puts on a  methyl group on this A. You might have thought that that would interfere  with base pairing, but it doesn't because adenine looks like this.  These are the guys that base pair with thymine, if you look back, and  you'll see that you could put a methyl group in there. It wouldn't  interfere with the base pairing, but would allow this to go. So, it was  the discovery of this phenomenon of restriction of bacteriophage grew on  one strain, not on another.</p>
<p>It could learn to grow on the other  strain. It could lose that acquisition. It was that phenomenon. People,  didn't have any other reason other than it was an interesting problem in  biology to understand it. Once they understood the basis of it, another  whole world opened up because you could see from basic principles, now I  could cut any piece of DNA. I could generate these little overhanging  sticky ends.</p>
<p>I could take a plasmid. People knew about those. I  could find one that only has one restriction site. I could stick things  in. Now I've attached an origin of replication to each of those pieces.  And I'm in business. I can now, for the first time ever, take a  particular piece of DNA and make as many copies as I want. And that was  an absolute transformation to the way people were able to think about  biology.</p>
<p>So I'm going to just kind of give you an idea of how  people would start. So the way people began and still begin most things  is they'd call it, the usual term is you call constructing a recombinant  DNA library. And there are a variety of different ways of doing this.  But this principle is the same. We'd take the DNA from whatever organism  you're interested in, and studying.</p>
<p>And we cut with some  restriction enzyme. And this restriction enzyme will cut wherever there  happened to be sites. They might be close together. They might be far  apart. But whatever, still generate some characteristic set of  fragments. And we'll now have, in this case, fragment number one,  fragment number two, fragment number three, fragment number four, and so  on. And if it's my DNA, there's a lot of fragments.</p>
<p>And of  course, they're all mixed up. I can't tell where any of them are.  They're just all mixed together in the test tube. Then we'll take that  vector that we've opened. And now, we'll mix all of these fragments  together with this vector. And then we join it just the way we  discussed. And now what we'll get, it's a collection of plasmids that  have different inserts.</p>
<p>So, one of the plasmids will have that  fragment number one. Another one of them will have fragment number two,  number three, and so on. Then this whole thing is what's known as a  library. You can see if it's DNA from me, there were 3 billion base  pairs to start. Given the human DNA, G A T C sequences are pretty  common. You can calculate the frequency yourself for how many sites on  average there would be for a restriction enzyme within a piece of DNA  and figure out roughly how the fragments there would be in the library  of human DNA.</p>
<p>So, we are partway there. We can now make a library.  We can make it from bacterial DNA. We can make it from human DNA. But  the next thing that people had to learn how to do was to figure out how  to find a particular fragment that had the gene that you are interested  in. And there's a whole variety of things. I mean, ultimately today  since the human genome is sequenced, you go on a computer and type and  you find it because the sequence is all known.</p>
<p>But the only reason  we can do that is because of all the work that was done in between. So,  I'll give you several ways of doing this. But one of the ways I think  you can see very easily, and it's actually going back to the term  complementation. Remember complementation? We had something that was  mutant, and then we'd put in a wild type gene, and fixed it up again.  So, for example, suppose I was studying histidine biosynthesis in E.</p>
<p>coli,  and I wanted to find the gene that encoded the enzyme that I had just  disabled in my histidine minus mutant. So, if I have a his auxotroph,  I'll call it a hisG gene, for example, that's one of the genes involved  in making histidine. So, since it's a histidine auxotroph, if I have it  on just minimal glucose plates, and I streak it out, it's not going to  grow. But if I grow it on minimal glucose plus histidine, then it will  be able to grow, right? So, I've got a variant of this organism.</p>
<p>It's  got a single mutation in it that's affecting one gene. And because I  don't have that gene, I can't grow on minimal. If I made a library of E.  coli DNA, which is going to have a lot of fragments as well, and I took  that library and I put it into this mutant, I'm going to get a big mess  of things, all the different plasmids with all the different fragments  that go into that mutant. How am I going to find the one that I want?  Anybody see that? It's not that hard.</p>
<p>I'm the mutant. I can't grow  on minimal because I can't make this enzyme. Therefore, I can't make  histidine. What do I need? How could you fix me up if you were a doctor?  What's the gene we want out of here? The one that makes that particular  enzyme that makes histidine. Yeah, take the whole library, stick it in  this mutant. If the gene coming in encodes DNA polymerase, I'm not going  to help this guy.</p>
<p>It still won't grow in minimal, take a gene  involved in making part of the cell wall won't help. But if I put in  the, I get a fragment of DNA that includes the hisG plus gene, and I put  it in here, it's going to grow up. If it has the plasmid that has, or  let's say the vector that has the hisG plus gene. So what you've done is  a really, sort of, you've used that principle of complementation that  some of you were sort of wondering about when we were doing genetics.</p>
<p>So,  you'd break a copy of a gene. In the things we talked about, we bring  in a whole chromosome that included in it just a wild type copy of the  gene. With recombinant DNA, we can really narrow it down in the extreme.  We can bring in a piece of DNA that is only the gene that's broken. And  we can take the gene back to the wild type. One thing, just to close,  you'll see, if you remember back when I talked about language that are  not universal, although the genetic code is universal, promoters and  things are not.</p>
<p>So I couldn't ever do this with a human DNA, could  I, because it wouldn't get expressed. So, we need some other ways of  finding those. We'll talk about those on the next lecture, OK?</p>
