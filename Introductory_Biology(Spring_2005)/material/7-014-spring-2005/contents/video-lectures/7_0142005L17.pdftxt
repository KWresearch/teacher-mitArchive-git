Transcript â€“ Lecture 17 

So today we are going to continue where we left off last time ta lking more 
specifica lly about variations on the theme of life. And  last year I tried to do this 
lecture using PowerPoint and it was a total disaster so I'm going back to the board. 
You will have the PowerPoint slides. They'll be on the Web to download to summarize 
basically what I'm draw ing on the board. But it will be slightly d ifferent on the board. 

But I found that for this materia l it rea lly doesn't work to exclusively use the 
PowerPoint. So last time we talked about, remember, my life on Earth abridged 
where -- -- we had photosynthesis making glucose or organic carbon plus oxygen? 
And then the reverse of this was resp iration. And then we had elements cycling in 
the midd le. And I said this  is very, very abbreviated of how all life on Earth works. 
And so today what I'm going to do is tell you that that's not right. 

That's grossly oversimp lified. And there are some rea lly interesting variations on the 
theme of how to extract energy and carbon and reducing power and electrons from 
the Earth's system to create life. And it's mostly microbes that have these diverse 
possibilities. And, aga in, even what I'm going to ta lk to you about today is 
oversimp lified. 

If you go to a microb iology textbook you'll find just about every possib le combination 
of energy sources, carbon sources and electron sources in some microorganism 
somewhere to get through life. So I'm giving you, aga in, the simplified version 
because otherwise it gets way too complicated. So a ll of life needs carbon and 
energy, and a lot of other elements, too, but these are the ma in axis upon which 
we're going to order our universe today. 

So for carbon the choices are inorganic or organic. So this would be CO2 and  this 
might be glucose or sugars, any sugars. And then on the energy axis they can use 
solar energy, as in photosynthesis, or they can use chemica l energy. And within the 
chemical energy sources they can be inorganic or organic like sugars, etc. And often 
here you have reduced compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, and we'll 
talk about these. So these are the ways we d ivide up the possibilities for carbon and 
energy sources to be alive. 

All organisms a lso need  to have an energy currency in the cell. And you've talked 
about this a lot already in the biochemistry lectures so I'm, again, just giving you the 
impressionist view of this. You know  the details. This is just to get you organized. 
And so a ll life uses redox reactions. And in your handouts for today there's a primer 
on redox reactions just  in case you want to review that. 

And one of the key reactions we'll ta lk about today is the conversion of NADP. If you 
put energy in you can reduce it to NADPH. So that's a reduction. And the reverse you 
get energy out when it's oxidized. Now, we're going to be talking about oxidation and 
reduction today. And then they all use ATP which you've talked a lot about here. And 
the couple here is ADP. Put energy in. You make ATP which is a high energy 
intermed iate. 

And in converting it back to ADP that energy can be released. And this is used in the 
biochemistry of the cell. So a ll cells have these two energy conversion processes in 
common. OK, so let's look at just summarizing what we're going to go over today. 
This is a summary of options for life. See a lso Freeman, Chapter 25. There is some 
discussion of this. And we can d ivide life here between what we call autotrophs. 
These are organisms that can make their own organic carbon. 

In other words, they can convert carbon dioxide to organic carbon. Heterotrophs are 
organisms that can only use organic carbon. They rely on the guts of other 
organisms in order to get through life. And so now we're going to systematically go 
through these processes that fall under each one of these. Oxygenic photosynthesis 
is the one we've been ta lking about last time and in my abbreviated version of life on 
Earth. 

And this is carried out by eukaryotic organisms, plants, trees, etc., and also by 
prokaryotic organisms. Those are the cyanobacteria, microscop ic photosynthetic 
plants. They use CO2 and sunlight. So our first variant on this theme we'll get into is 
a group of bacteria that do anoxygenic photosynthesis. Oxygenic means they evolve 
oxygen. These guys use solar energy but they don't evolve oxygen. 

And we'll get into how that works. And then there's a group of organisms that still 
use CO2. And in the very similar pathway the Calvin Cycle is photosynthesis. But 
they use chemical energy  in order to make these intermediates to  fix CO2. OK, so 
let's talk about those first. And so we're going to ta lk about the autotrophs. And all 
of them share this pathway, CO2 to C6H12. This would be glucose. 

And it takes ATP  to run this reaction and it a lso takes reduced NADPH -- -- to run 
this reaction. It also takes this enzyme RuBisCO which you've ta lked about I'm sure, 
ribulose b isphosphate carboxylase. And this is the enzyme that initia lly takes the 
CO2  from the atmosphere and b inds it to an organic carbon. Now, in a detailed 
version of this is what's called the Ca lvin Cycle or the Calvin/Benson Cycle. 

I don't know which one your book ca lls it. Calvin got the Nobel Prize but Benson was 
the graduate student that did all the work, so you should  recognize that. Anyway, 
you stud ied this in great deal. But an interesting factoid is that RuBisCO is the most 
abundant protein on Earth. That tells you how important this reaction is for 
susta ining life on Earth. So notice that in order to drive this reaction, which is the 
Calvin Cycle,  it requires energy and  reducing power. 

So where do they get it? Well, there are three ways that autotrophs can get energy 
and reducing power to drive this reaction. And the first is oxygenic photosynthesis. 
And the second is anoxygenic. And the third is chemosynthesis. OK, those first three 
there. So now we're going to go through each of these and look at how they work 
remembering that a ll of them are generating ATP and NADPH in order to drive that. 

So a ll of the autotrophs have that in common. Well, oxygenic photosynthesis is the 
one that you know well a lready. You've studied it in great deta il in b iochemistry. So 
we're going to, again, give you the abbreviated version here just so you have a 
template to map these other ones onto. These are what are known as the light 
reactions of photosynthesis, the Z scheme taking solar energy, sp litting water, 
evolving oxygen and synthesizing ATP and NADPH. 

This is all familiar, right? Very familiar. I'm just writing it in a cartoon version. OK, so 
this is the NADPH and ATP that goes to  fuel that process. OK, so now, well, at least I 
can do it on that board. Let me do it on this board. Anoxygenic -- -- is almost exactly 
like this process, but instead of sp litting water these guys oxidize hydrogen sulfide. 

So here's our ATP and NADPH. And they use sunlight to do this. So these are ca lled 
photosynthetic bacteria. And they were around very early on the Earth. Long before 
the Earth's atmosphere was oxygenated these were the guys that were able to use 
solar energy and make organic carbon but without evolving oxygen. Then 
somewhere along the line some cell evolved, had some mutations and somehow 
figured out that water,  this abundant source of water was a much better electron 
donor than hydrogen sulfide. 

And once the biochemistry figured this out, you can see the simple substitution here, 
the whole Earth started going in a different d irection. So this is an  interesting 
example of how a small b iochemica l innovation can dramatically change the whole 
nature of the p lanet. Now, these guys are still around on Earth. In fact, I'm going to 
show you some. 

I'll expla in this at the end, but I have some captured in here. See that little purple 
band? Those are those guys. I've got other little tricks in here but I'll save those. 
Well, you cannot really see the purple band. But you can come up later and look at 
it. Those are photosynthetic bacteria. So they're still around on the Earth but they're 
stuck in places where there's no oxygen. 

So they have a rather restricted niche on the planet now, but they're still extremely 
important. What did I do? Oh, here it is. So one of the places that they can be found, 
and if you're interested in them a great p lace to go find some is out at the Mystic 
Lakes in Arlington which is a permanently stratified lake so the bottom of the lake is 
always anaerobic. There's never oxygen there. 

In a typ ica l lake like that you have a lot of mud on the bottom and you have a lot of 
hydrogen sulfide coming out of the mud from bacteria l processes that we'll ta lk 
about. And you have light here. And so you have a gradient here of this  is oxygen 
and this is H2S. And these photosynthetic bacteria have to live somewhere where 
there's enough light to photosynthesize and enough hydrogen sulfide to use in this 
part of the reaction. 

But they're very sensitive to oxygen so they cannot be  in the oxygenated part of the 
lake. So you  find them in a layer. It's called the squeeze. They have to have light so 
they have to be up, but they cannot have oxygen so they have to be down. And they 
need hydrogen sulfide so they have to be down. So they're layered in lakes. OK. So 
what about these guys, chemosynthesis? They don't rely on solar energy. 

Again, they're still driving the Ca lvin Cycle reducing CO2 from the air into organic 
carbon, but they're not using sunlight. So what do they do? They get their energy --
-- from redox reactions. And let's just show you an example. Redox reactions couple 
to the conversion of oxygen to H2O. So oxygen  is involved in these reactions. 

And one organism, for example, can take ammonia and convert  it to nitrite. Another 
type of organism can take nitrite and convert it to nitrate. And there are other 
organisms that can take hydrogen sulfide and convert it to sulfate. And some can 
take hydrogen sulfide, oh, no, take iron, ferrous iron, Fe2+ and convert it to Fe3+. 

So in all of these cases what is happening to these compounds? Are they being 
oxid ized or reduced? I heard an oxidized. 

Yes, they're being oxid ized. So these reduced compounds, relatively reduced 
compounds can be utilized by oxidiz ing them. The organism can release the energy 
that's needed. ATP is generated here. And NADPH is generated by any of these redox 
coup les. So using this energy then the cell takes the reduced NADPH and the ATP 
and it runs the Calvin Cycle, chemosynthesis. OK. Now, you may think that these are 
kind of strange, weird bacteria that live in strange pockets of the Earth where there's 
no oxygen. 

And who cares anyway? They're outdated. They dominated the Earth way back in the 
early stages of the Earth but they're not so important now. Well,  that's not true. 
They're incredib ly  important. In some ecosystems they're the total base of the entire 
ecosystem. But a lso on a g loba l scale, as you'll learn, you should have a feeling for 
this by the end of this lecture, but also when we ta lk about globa l b iogeochemical 
cycles you will learn that these microbes are rea lly messengers for electrons in the 
environment. 

Without them the redox ba lance of the Earth would not be ma inta ined, OK? You 
cannot have nothing but oxidiz ing reactions or nothing but reduction reactions and 
have a system sustain itself. So it's these microbes that are p laying a really 
important role in maintaining the redox balance of the Earth. OK. Now, one system 
that I'm going to show you in that DVD, that will do much better justice to it than my 
drawings here, that's a deep-sea volcano in case you d idn't recognize it. 

And this is 2500 meters at the bottom of the ocean, very, very deep. And there is 
intense heat. I mean just think of a volcano on the surface of the Earth. Intense heat 
and reduced compounds are found in the Earth's mantle that are ready to erupt 
through this deep-sea volcano. And you have sulfate in the sea water that percolates 
through here. And as it percolates in and gets draw into the volcanic stuff that's 
coming out of here it's reduced to hydrogen sulfide coming out of the volcano. 

But you have oxygen in the water in the deep-sea. And we'll be talking about this 
when we ta lk about ocean circulation. But the oceans have a globa l ocean circulation 
where the surface water that's in equilibrium with the atmosphere actua lly sinks and 
travels a long the bottom of the ocean. So there  is oxygen in the bottom of the 
ocean, unlike many lakes where you don't have oxygen. And we'll talk about that 
difference. 

And in the hot vents the water coming out of here can be very, very hot, but there's 
a grad ient right as it comes out meeting the colder sea water. And so what you have 
here is a perfect incubator for chemosynthetic bacteria -- -- that use the hydrogen 
sulfide in chemosynthesis to fix carbon d ioxide using  the oxygen here. And that 
forms the base of the entire food web in the deep ocean because there's no light 
down there. 

There's no photosynthesis. There's only chemosynthesis. And just a little story that 
goes back to when I first came to MIT as an assistant professor in 1976. You weren't 
even born. But when I was young we used to go the Muddy Charles Pub periodically 
after work and have beers. And there was a professor,  in this department actua lly, 
John Edmond, who passed away severa l years ago but who used to be there. 

It was sort of like our Cheers. And I'll never forget the day he came back from a 
cruise. He came to the pub. He was a chemist and I'm a biologist. And he sa id you 
will not believe what we found on the bottom of the ocean. He had gone down in 
Alvin, this two-person submersib le vehicle. And he started talking about these giant 
clams and these giant tube worms and all of these things, and I thought he had had 
one too many beers. 

I found it hard to believe. Well, it turned out that that was the first d iscovery of 
these deep-sea vents and he was on that expedition. And through that colleg ial 
relationship I actua lly ended up w ith one of the clam shells from the clams there, 
which is one of the g iant clams. Their meat is b lood red because they have a specia l 
kind of hemoglob in that they use to keep the oxygen tension perfect for these 
chemosynthetic bacteria. 

If the oxygen is too high they cannot do this because it w ill spontaneously oxid ize 
the H2S. So the oxygen tension is very critica l. And they have a specia l kind of 
hemoglobin that does that. So these clams had symbiotic chemosynthetic bacteria. 
Well, since then these vents have been d iscovered everywhere and ecosystems 
similar have been discovered on the surface. 

And there are all kinds of d ifferent vents. You're going to learn about not only 
hydrothermal vents, hot vents  in this video, but also cold seeps they're ca lled where 
you have methane bacteria that are really  important. OK. So these are the main 
ways  in which organisms can get energy to convert CO2 to organic carbon. Then you 
have all these heterotrophs, the ones that use the organic carbon, and they have 
various ways of doing that. 

You've learned in biochemistry the primary way, which is very powerful, and that is 
using aerob ic resp iration to do that. And so we are just going to abbreviate that 
here. That's our reverse of photosynthesis. So heterotrophs. So we have first 
aerobic. And let me jump ahead w ith the slides. OK, there you are. So this is a 
cartoon version of aerobic respiration. So we'll just put glucose, we'll come down to 
the Krebs' Cycle. 

And we are going to let electrons flow here and have oxygen be the final electron 
acceptor creating water. So we've really just accomplished the absolute reverse of 
photosynthesis and we've made NADH in doing this and we've made ATP. So these 
guys are getting the energy out of the g lucose that a ll of the other organisms made. 
And oxygen is the termina l electron acceptor when there's oxygen around. 

But there are  lots of environments, as we've ta lked about on Earth, where there  isn't 
oxygen. And there are bacteria that can take advantage of those environments. And 
instead of having oxygen be the terminal electron acceptor there are a number of 
other elements that they can use, compounds that they can use. For examp le, there 
are some that use nitrate and they reduce it to nitrous oxide. 

N2. Ammonia. All the relatively reduced forms of nitrogen. And so this called 
anaerob ic. And this process is ca lled gentrification. And if it weren't for these 
bacteria, these anaerobic bacteria that can reduce nitrate, nitrogen would never 
return to the atmosphere. Remember last time we talked about nitrogen fixation, 
how specific types of microbes can take N2 from the atmosphere and pull it into the 
ecosystem? Well, if you d idn't have these bacteria doing this process that nitrogen 
would never get back to the atmosphere. 

They're central to closing the nitrogen cycle. Then there are some that can use 
sulfate and  reduce  it to hydrogen sulfide. As you can imag ine, these are critica l to 
creating the hydrogen sulfide that's used in these other processes. There are some 
that use CO2 and convert to methane. These are methanogenic bacteria, and  they're 
incredib ly important in the globa l carbon cycle and in the methane cycle. 

Methane is a  really powerful greenhouse gas, and we're going to ta lk about that 
later. And then there are some that can take Fe3+ and reduce it to Fe2+. And the 
same for manganese. So you should be starting  to sense a sort of symmetry here, 
right, that these anaerobic bacteria are fulfilling functions on the Earth. Let me write 
these down. These are sulfate reducers, these are methanogens, and these are iron 
reducers and manganese reducers. 

So these w ill a ll become extremely important when we ta lk about the global 
biogeochemica l cycles of all of these elements. It's these microbes that make sure 
that the cycles can continue and don't run into a dead end of oxidation or reduction. 
OK. Before we go to the movie, I just want to say if you look at Table 25.2 in your 
textbook, I think it's that one. I'm assuming I'm using the most recent version. 

You'll see a variation of this theme in which there will be some entries of organisms 
that don't fa ll into these categories that I've just shown you. And that is to say that 
there are organisms that use light energy and organic carbon energy at the same 
time. For every variation that's possible there's an organism that's evolved to  take 
advantage of it. I've just oversimplified it here, but you should know  that. 

And the bottom line is if it's thermodynamically possible. And, again, this whole 
lecture could have been done in a thermodynamic mode. We could have looked at 
which redox couples were energetically possib le and then assigned those to 
particular microbes. But for now I just want you to get the overview. But for 
anything that's thermodynamically feasible there's a microbe out there that's doing 
it. 

And, in  fact, microb iologists actua lly comb through redox tables and put together 
different redox couples and hypothesize. I ought to be ab le to find an organism that 
does this in that environment. And then they go out. And they can almost always 
actually find it. So they're incredibly versatile. And it g ives you a really good strong 
feeling for the power of thermodynamics in driving the evolution of these b iochemica l 
processes. 

Finally, before we show you the movie I want to show you what this thing is all 
about. There was a Russian microbiolog ist back  in the previous century named 
Winogradsky -- -- who wanted to isolate some of these photosynthetic bacteria. And 
know ing what their characteristics were he went out and got himself some mud and 
some pond water. And he set up what we've come to call a W inogradsky column. 

This is a W inogradsky juice bottle, but it works the same. And what you do is you 
put mud in the bottom and you put pond water here. And the pond water has 
basically an inoculum. It has representatives of all different types of bacteria. They 
might be spores. If they don't like the environment they're in they sporulate and 
then they just don't germinate. But presumably  in pond water you have everything 
that could possib ly grow in here. 

And in the mud you add a source of sulfate. And so you might add calcium sulfate 
and you might add a little organic matter, you know, plant parts or something just to 
jumpstart it. And eventually you set up a gradient here of hydrogen sulfide and 
oxygen. And over time the organisms grow a long that grad ient. So you'll end up 
down here with the anaerob ic resp iration. 

In fact,  the organisms generate this gradient. When you start out the whole thing is 
oxygenated. And what you should think about in this context is what happens. How 
do these grad ients get generated when you start out with a completely mixed 
system, everything in there, everything oxygenated? Eventually you have anaerob ic 
-- First you'll just have aerob ic resp iration, right? Anything that can use organic 
carbon and oxygen  is going to go like mad, and  that's what's going to draw the 
oxygen down. 

Then you'll have anaerobic respiration here. You'll have photosynthesis up here, 
evolving oxygen. You'll have chemosynthetic bacteria here because they need a little 
bit of oxygen but they also need some of this hydrogen sulfide and photosynthetic 
bacteria here. Well, they're like down here. Because they need light but cannot have 
oxygen. And so you can set these up. And this purp le band here tells you that you've 
got your photosynthetic bacteria.
