7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 24 

OK, so I'd like to go now to the next segment of the course. Think you can probab ly 
appreciate little b it better this triangle I had on before about how what biochemists 
did was they tended to break cells open, look at the component parts, through other 
things in there, and then proteins. But an awful  lot of stuff having to do with function 
is proteins, and what geneticists, the discipline of genetics would do, which made 
mutants of living organisms, and that looked at how function was affected by 
mutating individual genes, how those were both very powerful approaches. 

Genetics told you what was really important, and biochemistry told you how it 
worked at a molecular level, but the rea l prob lem is know ing whether this thing you 
had doing something in the test tube was actually the one that did it in life. And I 
think I told you when Arthur Kornberg isolated the very first DNA polymerase, he 
was ab le to copy DNA. And he got a Nobel prize, and it was the first enzyme that 
could copy DNA, and then John Karens made a mutant that was  lacking the enzyme. 

And the organism was still alive. So therefore, it couldn't have been the DNA 
polymerase that was copying the chromosome. It actua lly turned out to be a DNA 
repair enzyme. So, if you can actually unite genetics and biochemistry, if you can 
take a mutant that's broken in a function and you found your protein was missing, or 
vice versa, then you had a very, very powerful insight because you connect your 
know ledge of what was physiologically important to the biochemistry that you're 
doing. 

But it was really, rea lly hard for years, and only  in very rare occasions did some 
geneticists have a mutant that suggests so strongly that some biochemists would 
look, or some b iochemists would have such a powerful result that they ta lked to a 
geneticist and see if anybody had  found the result. And the power of recombinant 
DNA, although it started a b iotech industry, and it made possible the sequencing of 
the genome, there's another level up one higher in conceptual understanding. 

And what it d id was,  it let you go back and forth between here and here. You 
wouldn't have any problem now if I gave you the sequence of the gene, you can 
order it. You could stick it in a cell and make massive amounts of the protein. You 
purified it twenty-fold and it would be pure, whereas before you might have had to 
purified it fifteen thousand-fold out of 1,000 g of cells, and you would have had to 
been a very good biochemists with 15 steps in order to purify it. 

So, you can go  from the sequence of the gene to the protein, or if we got a protein 
and we wanted to know which gene we'd just sequence a b it of the protein, use that 
genetic code, work ourselves backwards to some possible sequences, then go looking 
for the sequences, and then go  find the gene. So, what recombinant DNA a llows us 
to do is close that loop. 

You can go from genetics to biochemistry and back and  forth. Now everybody does 
everything instead of it being isolated d iscip lines, which it was when I entered the 
field. So, all of the stuff depended on the development to clone particular pieces of 

DNA. And  I want to make clear right at the beginning, there's a couple of uses of 
cloning that are in popular usage right now. 

What we're ta lking about in this lecture is cloning a p iece of DNA. What that means, 
is I'm going to take a particular segment of DNA, say, cut  it here, and cut it there. 
And I'm going to take that piece, and I'm going  to do something to  it that lets me 
amplify it and make many, many copies of that piece of DNA. And cloning of 
anything else you make a whole lot of copies. So that's one use of the word cloning. 

The other use, which you see in the popular press a ll the time, is cloning an 
individual, thought being there: you would take the nucleus from the cell of the 
individual, put that nucleus into an egg that didn't have  its own nucleus moved, and 
now you hope what you get out of that is an organism that has a ll the same genetic 
content as the starting ind ividual. And in  fact, although it sounds very good in paper, 
is you're probably beginning to see it's not the panacea that people thought it was, 
or that we'd have to worry that in 10 years, a ll of my MIT students would be clones 
of the brightest person in the class or anything like that, because other stuff 
happens, that you get to in advanced biology courses, but there are mod ifications of 
DNA. 

There's all sorts of stuff that happens to  it, so it's not identica l. And so many of these 
cloned organisms, like Dolly the sheep, that was famous, died early w ith, I forget, 
arthritis and things. So, there are a lot of problems on that score. But that's the 
other use of the word cloning and that's not what these next three lectures that we 
are talking about cloning a piece of DNA. 

And that was the big problem that faced the field, certa inly when I was an undergrad 
and even when I was a grad student I was interested in synthesiz ing pieces of DNA, 
and it was one of those things that people sa id, why are you doing it? Well, because 
you could try to do it. What if you got a piece of DNA, like Gobind Khorana, who 's my 
colleague, who got the Nobel prize for synthesiz ing the first gene. 

He synthesized it. It was a tRNA gene that was 120 nucleotide base pa irs long or 
something. He synthesized it. He'd shown you could do it. But you couldn't do 
anything w ith it. And there were sort of two big problems. One was the fact that this 
DNA, although it's not a monotonous tetranucleotide. It's pretty hard to tell. Each 
one of these things is a base pair, and human DNA has 3 b illion of those. And a b it 
down here, doesn't look very d ifferent than the bit out there. 

And it certainly wouldn't looks very different than the b it of DNA that's 2 billion base 
pairs over on the other side of campus or something. So, there is no way to take 
DNA and cut it reproducibly, so you to get fragments. What you could see from first 
principles was what you would need was magic scissors. And what would the scissors 
look like? Well, it would have to be scissors that could  read a sequence as there's 
nothing else d ifferent. 

You know it's a  regular backbone, and it's only four nucleotides. So, if you wanted to 
cut DNA in particular places, you had to have scissors that could see a sequence. 
And furthermore, you can see they couldn't just, there are the hydrogen bond ing 
parts of A and T or G and C because those are stuck together there  in the middle of 
the DNA. So, you'd need scissors that could somehow find a sequence and make a 
cut. 

And those were found. I'm going to  till you about those. They're ca lled restriction 
enzymes. So that was part of the thing. The other thing was, imagine I could cut out 
this fragment. And they gave it to you, and I sa id, great. Now I've got it. Would you 
make me a lot of copies of this DNA? Could you do that? Let's say, you now know 
how to transform the principle that we saw back with Avery. 

We could take naked DNA and put this fragment into the cell. Would  it rep licate? 
What do you think? Anybody remember? No? OK, we talked about some other 
languages, right? But one of the things that's in the DNA is the genetic code w ith a ll 
the genes. And we can find the read ing frame. Remember when we ta lked about an 
orig in of replication. I said that was sort of, at least for E. 

coli there's one origin. In eukaryotes the origins are spaced out along the DNA. And 
every time you have a round of replication, it starts with one of those origins and 
then goes. So the chance of this piece of DNA by chance is going to have an origin  is 
pretty small. So if I put it into an organism, it's going to sit there, if you're lucky, 
maybe degraded because it's got b lunt ends, or even if I made it into circle it 
probably wouldn't replicate because it probably doesn't have the word in the DNA 
that says "start a round of DNA rep lication". 

So, the other overarching principle of DNA replication is you somehow have to take 
the fragment of DNA that you're looking at, and you have to attach it to an origin of 
replication. Now, if you have an orig in of replication and you have a fragment of 
DNA, and you put it in the cell, now you'll get a  lot of copies of that piece of DNA. So 
that's what recomb inant DNA is all about in a  really, really simple form. 

I'm just going to take you now into increasing sort of levels of detail. So, let me just 
sort of g ive you just sort of a really broad view of this cloning, and then we'll sort of 
start to d ive in to some of the fancier techniques that have come out of this. We'll 
talk about DNA sequencing, and PCR, and stuff in the next lecture. So the first 
principle here is to cut the DNA, and  I know you may think this is sort of baby talk, 
but this is how  I think. 

If you rea lly think about this stuff, this is what  it rea lly is. With sequence specific 
molecular scissors, these have the rather odd name. They're called restriction 
enzymes. I don't know if any of you know why they're called restriction enzymes, 
and although I'm sure that some of you have used them in your UROP to cut up 
pieces of DNA. But what that does, these are enzymes, as I'll tell you, that recognize 
a particular sequence. 

And they a lways cut at that sequence. The value of that  is you can reproducibly cut 
DNA exactly the same spot, and the spots are specified by whatever sequence that 
particular pair of scissors knows how to read. Then the next thing we have to do is 
we need to join the piece of DNA to an origin of replication. So the thing that carries 
the origin of rep lication is called a vector. And usua lly, not a lways, these are circles. 

We'll consider the ones that grow  in E. coli are most of the time, or in bacteria, 
mostly circles. They are the ones that are broadly used for most cloning. So, we'll 
talk about those. What makes a vector? What it has to have is an origin of DNA 
replication. They usually have something else. We could call it a selectab le marker, 
but something like a drug resistance. 

If any of you have done cloning in a UROP usua lly it's something like a gene for 
making the cell amp icillin resistant, or tetracycline resistant, some antib iotic that 
would normally kill the cell. So you can tell, does that cell have that vector or not 
because the cell starts out amp icillin sensitive but it acquires the vector that's 
replicating it, also acquires the gene that gives it the drug  resistance. 

But if we're going to cut that, if we're going to join a p iece of DNA to that, we can't 
join into a circle w ithout breaking it. So, we need to cut the vector at a unique site. 
And we would use a  restriction enzyme for that. And you can also see in designing a 
vector, you'd want something that only has one site. So, what we would have 
achieved from this conceptua lly as we've now got this, this is the vector,  its origin of 
replication here, and let's say ampicillin resistance, for example, as a selectable 
marker, the gene for that could be encoded here. 

And we have the fragment of, if you want to that down, just put it down on the floor, 
I think. We've made the point at this stage. Thanks. What one has to do is to join 
this piece of DNA to that. And we'll go to the molecular deta ils of this. But, we'll join 
the fragment to the vector, and actually this was something that was a lready in 
molecular biolog ists' toolkits, have been studying DNA replication. 

That's DNA ligase. When we finish an Okazaki fragment, we had to sea l nicks and the 
enzyme that did that was an enzyme ca lled DNA ligase. So, molecular b iologists 
basically had the scotch tape or the glue to join stuff back together. What they were 
missing for many, many years where the sequence- specific molecular scissors. So at 
this stage, if we were doing the recombinant DNA, we now have a vector. 

We now have a p iece of DNA joined to it. In  fact, we probab ly have a whole other 
mess of things that happens along the way. But at the moment, they're in a test 
tube. So, if we want to have this thing grow, what do we have to do next? We are 
going to have to get the DNA from outside the cell inside the cell. That's the word; 
we need to transform the DNA into a cell. 

Again, the word transform, that goes back to those transformation experiments w ith 
the Streptococcus pneumonia going  from smooth to rough, and you are taking stuff 
from the cell that transformed them from rough to smooth, whatever, that's where 
the word came from, but we now know  it's getting naked DNA inside the cell where it 
can be replicated. And then the next thing we need to know is, what cells have 
acquired this vector that at least has the vector. 

We'll settle for that in the beginning, and to do that, you need to select for the 
marker on the vector. In the case of this one, we would start w ith a strain that's 
killed by amp icillin, and then we just plate it out and ask for guys that are ampicillin 
resistant. And, you can see that there is another class of prob lem because if we had 
uncut vector, and there would probably be, for sure, some of that in our mix,  that 
would make the cell amp  resistant. 

And if we had an insert, it would be amp  resistant. So,  if we really wanted to get into 
this, we'd have to do some more work to sort out what's on there. But that's the 
basic stuff. I suspect most of you know this practically since kindergarten. But that's 
the overall framework into which, now, I'm going to start layering different pieces of 
deta il. And the next part, aga in, some of you may know. 

I don't think it w ill be a totally foreign concept. You are probab ly familiar with this, 
that what are these restriction enzymes? The actual word is restriction endonuclease. 
They are often usually called restriction enzymes in a lab parlance. Nuclease  is 
something that cuts the nucleic acid, and endonuclease is one that doesn't need a 
free end. So, it can cut in the midd le of the sequence instead of nibbling at the end. 

That would be an exonuclease. So, these things have names that tend to be 
something like EcoRI, which has something to do with where they are derived from. 
And a  typ ica l one, one of the very first ones that is still in really wide use, is EcoRI. 
And this recognizes the sequence G A A T T C. Now, you'll notice that if you read the 
sequence in this way it's the same sequence when you read it on the other strand. 

It's ca lled a pa lindrome but be careful because palindromes in English, those are 
words that you read from the front to  the back; they're the same. In an English 
letter, it doesn't matter whether it's in A here or an A there. But you guys know 
something about DNA structure. There's a five to three prime polarity. So, reading 
this way doesn't look at all the same. 

It's totally different. But reading in this strand, we say that's five to three. The thing 
that's identical is the reciproca l sequence on the other side. So there is this, you see 
G A A and G A A but it's not like the English word palindrome, so don't get yourself 
mixed up about that. Anyway, what this will then, what this enzyme then does,  is it 
cuts to the side here. It cuts symmetrically. 

And what it generates then is a G three prime hydroxyl. Remember the ribose? If we 
have, say, an A there, this is the three prime position, and that's the five prime 
position in the sugar. So, it leaves a three prime hydroxyl, and is also then leaves a 
five prime phosphate. So, we'd have A A T T C here, and then on the other side, we 
would get the reciproca l thing. So, we'd have G with a three prime hydroxyl, and 
then over A A T T C like that. 

So now we've got a break here. We can pull those apart. But one of the nice things 
you can see right from  this is that we're generating five prime sing le stranded ends, 
and this one is the sequence A A T T C. This is A A T T C here, and these guys, if 
they could get together and line up as they would here, they'd be able to  form 
hydrogen bonds. So, if you take an enzyme like EcoRI, and we took, let's say, a 
circle that had a single EcoRI site, G A A T T C, if we cut it with the restriction 
enzyme we would make nicks. 

And if we kept it cold, all that we'd have is DNA nicks. And if we warm things up a 
little bit, there's only four hydrogen bonds that are hold ing that together. So, the 
thing would linearize and just flop around in the breeze. If we cooled it slow ly, the 
thermodynamically most favorable state, the lowest energy state, would be w ith 
those ends coming back together. 

So, we could then add DNA  ligase. If we added these up and added DNA ligase, we 
could reverse the process and go back and  forth, EcoRI to cut it, ligase to ligate. And 
then, the beauty of recombinant DNA  is this rejoining part doesn't see what's out 
here or what's out there. All it sees is the little ends that are generated by an EcoRI 
site. So they take some of my DNA, and I'll cut it up. 

I'll get a zillion EcoRI fragments, but they'll all have the same  little overhanging b it 
that's comp lementary to the vector. So  if I take a vector cut w ith EcoRI, and I take 

some of my own DNA and I mix them, I can get a little fragment, get in between the 
vector, and it does exactly that joining that I was d iagramming  right here. So again, 
it was the d iscovery of these restriction enzymes that made possib le a lmost a ll the 
stuff that's happened  in biology since 1975. 

The development of restriction enzymes was essentially, I was a postdoc at Berkeley 
at that point and the labs, Stan Cohen at Stanford, Herb Boyer at UCSF, and a two 
others around the country were working on this. They were almost all labs that had 
worked on bacterial plasmids. P lasmids are  little circles of DNA, so the labs that 
started were ones who have been busy studying little circles of DNA that usually 
carry drug-resistance between cells. 

And so that was happening while I was a postdoc. And when I got to MIT in '76 the 
technology was just beginning. I was one of the first labs trying to cut pieces of DNA 
and join them back together. So, it's a pretty recent development. At that point, DNA 
sequencing hadn't been invented. The idea that you could pull out a piece of DNA 
and do something w ith it or produce a protein was just a thought. 

It didn't exist. So it's hard to overemphasize how critica l the discovery of these 
restriction enzymes were. Now, I just want to tell you where they came from, or how 
people found them. And I'll try and do  this quickly because I know some of you get 
impatient w ith history. But this is rea lly important because it's very easy to make fun 
of basic research. You can ridicule anything pretty easily, and you might just ask 
because I'm telling you the story. 

Somebody proposed doing this. I'm going to tell you the experiment that basically is 
the basis of the biotech industry, and would you have been smart enough to 
recognize that it was the discovery of a phenomenon ca lled restriction, restriction of 
bacteriophage growth on bacteria? And it was, here are actually a couple of EM's of 
these little p lasmids. This is an electron micrograph one. 

In these little circles  it's been shadowed. And this is actually artificially colored, but 
that was the kind of p lasmids that peop le were cutting up. So, as I said, trying to get 
through this DNA, and the stuff, what's made possible the sequencing at the 
Whitehead Genome Center and stuff that I'll tell you about is going on. I d idn't really 
set this one up. But that's Eric Lander who teaches 7.012 in the fall. I told you a 
picture from that DNA 50th. 

Well, they had a banquet at the end of it, and  I was there. This is Svante Paabo from 
Europe who is sequencing the chimp genome. And that's Francis Collins who  is head 
of the entire Human Genome Project. This  is Evelyn W itkin, who was a big discoverer 
of early DNA repair events. And I put that one in because it was sort of interesting. 
There was Eric, and Savand i, and Francis were talking about what would happen 
when they knew the sequence of the chimp genome, which wasn't done. 

And there was an advertisement, a poster advertising Jim Watson's latest book. And 
they ripped that in ha lf, and were writing notes on the back all the way through 
dinner. So if you want to see what scientists on the cutting edge, includ ing someone 
who teaches 701 the fall looks like when they are not teaching 701, there is a 
picture. So anyway, the discovery of restriction enzymes was Sa lvador Luria, who 
I've mentioned. 

He was a member of the biology department, and one of our Nobel Prize w inners. He 
started the Cancer Center. He a lso trained Jim Watson, when I showed you that 
picture. This  is Sa lvador standing over here. Another thing that Salvador did, he was 
a Nobel Prize winner but he taught introductory biology. So I am basica lly following 
in the footsteps of Salvador. 

He wrote a book called, even though he was a Nobel Prize winner, a book called "36 
Lectures in Introductory Biology. And some universities, the  intro to b iology is taught 
by whoever is at the bottom of the food cha in. The most junior professor gets stuck 
with intro to b iology. And here it's the other way. I mean you're getting Eric and 
Bob, for example, Weinberg to teach in the fall, tells you that. 

And really where that comes from is the fact that Salvador Luria had such an interest 
in replication. So he tra ined Jim Watson, started the Cancer Center here, and he also 
carried out this phenomenon of restriction. And he did this working with 
bacteriophage. And I know some of you wrote, you don't like to see old guys on 
porches. So I got freaked out, and I took this next picture out for this morning. 

Oh, I've got to show it anyway for two reasons. This is Sa lvador sitting on a porch at 
Cold Spring Harbor with Max Delbruck who started, rea lly, much of the work on 
bacteriophage that gave us the underp innings of microb iology. And I put it partly on 
A) because  it shows the informality of the molecular b iology culture which persists to 
this day, and B) because Salvador had such an impish sense of humor. 

You would have really enjoyed had he been teaching this course. Anyway, Sa lvador 
was studying just bacteriophage. Remember we ta lked about it? And they're 
basically a syringe, they  injected their DNA into  the cell. There's an electron 
micrograph. The DNA is up top there. It goes in, and then the DNA takes over the 
cell, reprograms it, and makes baby phage. And I showed you how we make 
plaques. So that was what Salvador was studying. 

And it's a little  like what we are talking about w ith Mendel. He d idn't have very many 
techniques ava ilab le to him at the time. He couldn't sequence DNA. He couldn't do a 
lot of things. But he could plate phage and count, and things  like that. And what 
Salvador was looking at, he had a bacteriophage, and he had two strains of bacteria. 
I'll call them A and B. OK, here comes the experiment that founded  the b iotech 
industry. 

You ready? You going to fund me? All right, so what I propose doing is I'm going  to 
grow the phage on strain A, and now  I'm going to plate on stra in A and strain B. I 
laid awake all last week thinking of this experiment. So what d id I get? I got a lot of 
plaques on stra in A, probably something like 10^9 or 10^10 per ml because that's 
what this phage lysate usually looks like once you've grown them up. 

And if I p late them over on strain B, no phage, maybe an occasiona l phage. So, 
obvioulsy the bacteriophage can grow fine on strain A. It can't grow on stra in B most 
of the time, but some variant has managed to  figure out how to grow on strain B. 
Given our foray into genetics, I think many of you would think, probably as I suspect 
Salvador d id at the time, the thing 's mutated. 

It's learned. It's made some change in its genomes that's a llowed it to grow on strain 
B. So, I wonder if it learned  to grow on stra in B, could it grow on strain A? So, 
basically what he took was the phage from that experiment, and then he plated 

them on strain A and stra in B. And, well, as you might guess, since it was growing 
on stra in B, lots of plaques, and there were  lots of plaques over here. 

OK, so  it didn't forget how to grow on strain A. So, better check over here, too, need 
a control experiment, so take this guy, p late it out, stra in A, stra in B, some plaques 
over here. That's not a surprise going in stra in A. We are back to where we started 
from. It doesn't sound like a mutant, does it? And if it was a mutant, everybody 
should have been the same. 

Instead, when you grew a phage on strain A, it didn't have the ability to grow on 
strain B. But if you gave it a chance to grow on strain B, most of them wouldn't 
make it. But if it ever d id, it had now acquired the ability to grow on stra in B. So it 
could still grow on both. But if you take somebody who had been grow ing, something 
had been growing on stra in A, it lost it. And so,  the idea  there was then that it wasn't 
a mutation. 

Something was happening in the stra in B that enabled it to grow on strain B. And if it 
ever got away from that environment, it lost it. So, the phenomenon was called 
restriction. It wasn't a mutation. It was something else. And it turned out, then, that 
restriction was due to an enzyme. An example of this kind of thing, then, would be 
this EcoRI activity that's ab le to cut at a very specific sequence. 

Now, if you are going to have a set of molecular scissors inside of you that could cut 
at G A T C sequences, you'd have a problem unless you did something else because 
every one of your G A T C sequences would be cut by the restriction enzymes. So 
what the cells that have a restriction enzyme have, is a modification enzyme that 
recognizes the same sequence, and then modifies it in some way that makes it 
resistant to the restriction enzyme. 

And in the case of the EcoRI, it puts on a methyl group on this A. You might have 
thought that that would interfere with base pairing, but it doesn't because adenine 
looks like this. These are the guys that base pair with thymine, if you look back, and 
you'll see that you could put a methyl group in there. It wouldn't interfere with the 
base pa iring, but would allow this to go. So, it was the discovery of this phenomenon 
of restriction of bacteriophage grew on one strain, not on another. 

It could learn to grow on the other strain. It could lose that acquisition. It was that 
phenomenon. Peop le, d idn't have any other reason other than it was an interesting 
problem in biology to understand it. Once they understood the basis of it, another 
whole world opened up because you could see from basic principles, now I could cut 
any piece of DNA. I could generate these  little overhanging sticky ends. 

I could take a plasmid. People knew about those. I could find one that only has one 
restriction site. I could stick things in. Now I've attached an origin of rep lication to 
each of those p ieces. And  I'm in business. I can now, for the first time ever, take a 
particular piece of DNA and make as many copies as I want. And that was an 
absolute transformation to the way peop le were able to think about biology. 

So I'm going to just kind of g ive you an idea of how peop le would start. So the way 
people began and still beg in most things is they'd ca ll it, the usua l term is you call 
constructing a  recombinant DNA library. And there are a variety of d ifferent ways of 
doing this. But this principle is the same. We'd take the DNA from whatever 
organism you're interested in, and studying. 

And we cut w ith some restriction enzyme. And this restriction enzyme will cut 
wherever there happened to be sites. They might be close together. They might be 
far apart. But whatever, still generate some characteristic set of fragments. And we'll 
now have, in this case,  fragment number one,  fragment number two, fragment 
number three, fragment number four, and so on. And if it's my DNA, there's a  lot of 
fragments. 

And of course, they're a ll mixed up. I can't tell where any of them are. They're just 
all mixed together in the test tube. Then we'll take that vector that we've opened. 
And now, we'll mix all of these fragments together w ith this vector. And then we join 
it just the way we d iscussed. And now what we'll get,  it's a collection of p lasmids 
that have d ifferent inserts. 

So, one of the p lasmids will have that fragment number one. Another one of them 
will have fragment number two, number three, and so on. Then this whole thing is 
what's known as a library. You can see if  it's DNA from me,  there were 3 b illion base 
pairs to start. G iven the human DNA, G A T C sequences are pretty common. You 
can ca lculate the frequency yourself for how many sites on average there would be 
for a  restriction enzyme within a piece of DNA and figure out roughly how the 
fragments there would be in the library of human DNA. 

So, we are partway there. We can now make a library. We can make it from bacterial 
DNA. We can make it from human DNA. But the next thing that people had to learn 
how to do was to figure out how to find a particular fragment that had the gene that 
you are interested in. And there's a whole variety of things. I mean, ultimately today 
since the human genome is sequenced, you go on a computer and type and you  find 
it because the sequence is all known. 

But the only reason we can do that is because of a ll the work that was done in 
between. So, I'll give you severa l ways of doing  this. But one of the ways I think you 
can see very easily, and it's actually going back to the term comp lementation. 
Remember comp lementation? We had something that was mutant, and then we'd 
put in a wild type gene, and fixed it up again. So, for examp le, suppose I was 
studying histidine biosynthesis in E. 

coli, and I wanted to find the gene that encoded the enzyme that I had just disab led 
in my histidine minus mutant. So, if I have a his auxotroph, I'll call it a hisG gene, 
for examp le, that's one of the genes involved in making histidine. So, since it's a 
histid ine auxotroph, if I have it on just minima l glucose plates, and  I streak it out, 
it's not going to grow. But if I grow it on minima l glucose plus histid ine, then it will 
be ab le to grow, right? So, I've got a variant of this organism. 

It's got a single mutation in it that's affecting one gene. And because I don't have 
that gene, I can't grow on minima l. If I made a library of E. coli DNA, which is going 
to have a lot of fragments as well, and I took that library and I put it into this 
mutant, I'm going to get a b ig mess of things, a ll the d ifferent plasmids w ith a ll the 
different fragments that go  into that mutant. How am I going to  find the one that I 
want? Anybody see that? It's not that hard. 

I'm the mutant. I can't grow on minimal because I can't make this enzyme. 
Therefore, I can't make histid ine. What do I need? How could you  fix me up if you 
were a doctor? What's the gene we want out of here? The one that makes that 

particular enzyme that makes histidine. Yeah, take the whole library, stick it in this 
mutant. If the gene coming in encodes DNA polymerase, I'm not going to help this 
guy. 

It still won't grow in minima l, take a gene involved in making part of the cell wa ll 
won't help. But if I put in the, I get a fragment of DNA that includes the hisG plus 
gene, and I put it in here, it's going to grow up. If it has the p lasmid that has, or 
let's say the vector that has the hisG plus gene. So what you've done is a  really, sort 
of, you've used that princip le of comp lementation that some of you were sort of 
wondering about when we were doing genetics. 

So, you'd break a copy of a gene. In the things we talked about, we bring in a whole 
chromosome that included in it just a wild type copy of the gene. With recombinant 
DNA, we can rea lly narrow it down in the extreme. We can bring in a piece of DNA 
that is only the gene that's broken. And we can take the gene back to the wild type. 
One thing, just to close, you'll see, if you remember back when I talked about 
language that are not universal, although the genetic code is universal, promoters 
and things are not. 

So I couldn't ever do this w ith a human DNA, could I, because it wouldn't get 
expressed. So, we need some other ways of find ing those. We'll talk about those on 
the next  lecture, OK?
