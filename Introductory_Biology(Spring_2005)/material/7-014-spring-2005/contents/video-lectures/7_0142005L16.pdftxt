Transcript â€“ Lecture 16 

So my name is Penny Chisholm and I am a professor in the Department of C ivil and 
Environmenta l Eng ineering with a joint appointment in b iology and I'm a microb ial 
ecologist. I'm an ecolog ist by training and  I work on microbes in the oceans, 
photosynthetic plants in the oceans. They're ca lled phytoplankton. That's the 
research that my lab does. Whenever I'm using examples in here, a lot of times I'll 
be using examples of microbes and of p lants in the oceans. 

I know most people know a lot more about trees than they know about things that 
photosynthesize  in the oceans. And I'll convince you that you should be as bonded to 
phytoplankton as you are to trees in terms of recognizing your dependency on them. 
So that's just a little bit about my background. Now, let me find out a little bit about 
you. Is there anyone in here who has taken the ecology class 7. 

30 or 1.018 that I used to teach but haven't taught for the last two years? No. Well, 
that's good because there's some redundancy. And are there any Terrascope 
students or a lums in here? OK. Just curious. So  let me tell you just briefly about my 
hopes for our interactions in this class, and I stress the term interaction. I don't want 
to stand up here ta lking at you. 

I really hope that you will ask questions and interact w ith me. It makes it much more 
interesting for us up here if peop le are asking questions and challenging. I expect 
you to cha llenge what I say. The field of ecology is very broad. It uses knowledge 
from physics, from chemistry, from geology, a ll these diverse fields, and b iology of 
course. And so some of the things I'm going to  talk about, I know there are students 
here who know more about it than I do because I think you all are majoring in very 
diverse majors at MIT. 

So I expect that if I'm saying something wrong that you cha llenge me because we're 
all in this together. The goal is to learn, not necessarily to be right all the time. OK. 
So what I'm going to do today is rea lly to give you a broad overview of the field of 
ecology. And the things that I'll talk about are things that we're going to go into in 
depth in the next series of whatever lectures I have, ten or eleven. 

So most of this you don't need to take any deta iled notes on or whatever. This is just 
to forecast what's to come. At the end I'll tell you what the important points are. So 
what is ecology? It's a very broad field and  it's basically the study of the interaction 
between organisms and their environment. Or the study of what regulates the 
distribution and abundance of organisms. 

And what we're going to do is ta lk about the subdivisions of ecology and look at the 
characteristics of ecological systems, define some genera l characteristics and then 
we'll beg in to  talk about ways that life med iates the transformation of energy and 
mass on Earth. So in this class I'm going to be talking about a ll levels of organization 
of living systems from the biochemical  level, the gene level to the entire biosphere, 
no small cha llenge. 

So the discipline of ecology, I'm going to move this down a little bit, is only about a 
hundred years old. It's a relatively new discipline but it's a strict natural science. 
Ecology is not environmentalism. Ecology is not recycling. Ecology is a branch of the 
biolog ical sciences. And  it uses the Scientific Method which I know you're all familiar 
with. 

But let's just review how ecologists learn about how systems work. And it starts with 
observation. Sometimes called descriptive. You go out and you describe what you 
see in nature. So description. And from that you form a hypothesis about the things 
that are structuring that system. And then you actually do experiments. And this is 
something that a lot of peop le don't realize. We can do experiments with ecologica l 
systems, be they microsystems, or some of the things we'll talk about in this class 
are experiments w ith whole ecosystems. 

For example, they'll clear-cut an entire forest watershed and compare then the 
behavior of the elements cycling in that watershed with a control watershed where 
you don't clear-cut the trees. So it's a basic experiment, just like you would do in 
test tubes. And there are numerous other examples about manipulating whole 
ecosystems,  fertilizing whole lakes. Obviously, it's more difficult because you have to 
get permission to do these kinds of things and have hundreds of rep licates of these 
experiments, but it is a way of understand ing the systems. 

And then  from the experimental results you test the hypothesis and then you 
develop models of how the system works. And then you revise your description 
based on the models. And then you keep going through that cycle. Ecology. At many 
universities you can get a PhD in ecology. They have whole departments of ecology. 
We at MIT don't. 

We have very few people even who are ecolog ists, but it is a field and you can go 
onto get a PhD. OK. So what are the subdisciplines of ecology? And it has to do with 
the hierarchical organization of living systems. Let me go onto my first slide here. 
And I have a pointer. Oh, well. I have to stand back. So when we think of living 
systems you can start with the atom. And together they come together and make up 
molecules, come together and make up the cell. 

And then the cells come together and make up tissues and organs, and then 
eventua lly you have an organism. Although, you can have unicellular organisms. 
Here's an organism. And then a group of organisms belong ing to  the same species is 
called a population in ecology. And there's a whole field called population ecology. 
We'll have a  few  lectures on that where you study what regulates the growth and the 
life cycles of a particular species of organism. 

And then a collection of populations is ca lled a community. And there's a whole field 
called community ecology. And then a collection of communities. This is a coral reef. 
Can you guys see these slides in the back or is there too much light? Is it OK? OK. 
Good. So this would be a cora l reef ecosystem. And then a ll of the ecosystems 
collectively on Earth constitute the biosphere. 

So ecologists study these systems at different  levels of organization depending on 
what questions they're interested  in. But of course this is a gross oversimp lification 
of what we know about living systems. For example, an organism. I mean is an 
organism rea lly an organism? Think of yourself,  for examp le. Are you only one 

species? You're a human, yes. But there are parts of you that aren't human, right? 
What's in your gut? E. 

coli. There are more bacteria in your gut than there are human cells in your body. 
And without those bacteria you'd be in troub le. Also your skin  is an ecosystem. It's 
teaming w ith mites and little creatures that  if you looked under the microscope you'd 
be appa lled. All of your pores have tiny little ecosystems in them. And most of these 
are doing their job. You're their hab itat. And they're helping you be a  living being. 

So you yourself are an ecosystem. So it's really difficult to ta lk about these in a very 
clean way. I mean you cannot rea lly study an organism all by itself because each 
organism is in itself an ecosystem or a community. Maybe not an ecosystem but a 
community of organisms. But this is the way we have come to d ivide up the living 
world at d ifferent levels of organization. 

And we w ill ta lk about all of these in this class. So ecology really has two broad 
branches. And that's how my series of lectures are d ivided up. One is ca lled 
biogeochemistry. And in this branch is the study of how organisms med iate the 
transformation of energy and matter in the biosphere. And this is essentially ta lking 
about the metabolism of ecosystems. In some ways we will talk about, you've been 
learning all about the b iochemistry of cells and how cells work and how they process 
energy, etc. 

The sum of a ll of that b iochem istry in cells results in these biogeochemica l cycles, 
the interactions between these organisms and their environment. When we talk 
about the metabolism of the biosphere you a lmost can think of yourself as being 
inside of a cell looking at the biochemistry of the whole cell from the inside. It's a ll a 
matter of scaling. And we'll see that. You've learned about photosynthesis and 
resp iration, right? Have they? Yes. 

Well, you'll see that those processes that you've learned about that are subcellular 
collectively a lso have a metabolism for the biosphere. OK. The second, and this will 
be my second set of lectures, is population and community ecology. And here we talk 
about organisms. Not just the b iochemistry, their collective biochemistry, but this is 
the study of the processes that regulate the d istribution and abundance of 
organisms. 

What determines the rates of population growth of a particular population? What 
determines the distribution of d ifferent species over the  landscape in a particular 
habitat? This part of ecology we often ta lk about as being the function of 
ecosystems, and this the structure. And the rea lly important thing to remember is 
that these two are very much obviously dependent on one another. If you change 
the structure of an ecosystem, if you cut down a ll the trees you will change the 
function of the ecosystem, there w ill be no photosynthesis. 

OK? So this is a really important point that these two are related. And we'll talk 
about that a lot in more detail when we go  forward here. If we can turn the lights off 
I'll show you one of my favorite, favorite, favorite slides, if it works. Ah, yes. This is 
to g ive you a feeling for the Earth as a living organism, in a sense. This is the 
biosphere. This is obviously a NASA image show ing the green is the plants on Earth 
and this is the dessert. 

The green in the ocean is the phytoplankton. And so where there's lots of green 
there's more phytop lankton. Where there's red there's even more. And now we're 
zooming into the Equatoria l Pacific. Here's a b ig bloom of phytop lankton. And this is 
about three seasons in the life of the Earth. OK? But it shows you how dynamic the 
surface film of the Earth is that we consider the biosphere. And a ll of this life and all 
of its cycling and dynamics influences the composition of our atmosphere and of our 
oceans, all of the nonliving components of the Earth. 

And really at the biosphere level what ecology is, is understand ing the interaction 
between the living processes and the nonliving processes  in the Earth and how they 
co-evolved to shape this living planet. If you were somebody out on Mars and you 
saw that, if you could see that from Mars, but you probab ly could if you were living 
on Mars because you'd be a different species and you could do all kinds of things, 
but you would really get a feeling for this p lanet is a live, just seeing those dynamics. 

And it is. And we don't know if we're the only ones but it's certainly worth 
understanding how the whole thing works. So that's the goa l which is rather 
intimidating but very exciting. OK. And very important concept in ecology is a 
thymine of emergent properties. And the idea is that at each  level of organization 
that we talked about here, well, if I cannot go back, I cannot go back. 

Oh, there we go. At each level of organization of the system that we ta lk about there 
has properties that only exist at that level or organization. So if you want to 
understand population ecology or community ecology you cannot study cellular 
ecology and just scale up. Now, this runs up aga inst a lot of MIT reductionist 
philosophy, right? I mean what we're all about here is taking things apart down to 
their component parts and understanding them and then building our knowledge 
from there. 

But this whole field of comp lexity theory that has emerged with a force, say in the 
last ten years, is show ing us that that's too oversimplified and that systems, at 
different levels of organizations, have their own properties. So if you want to 
understand how the Earth works you've got to understand the Earth. You cannot just 
understand how all the atoms are working. They're coming together to make the 
organisms. 

And this is fundamenta lly because of feedbacks in the system. So let me give you an 
example. OK. The brain, and this isn't ecology but it's an example you can relate to, 
has ten to the twelfth cells w ith ten to the fourteenth connections. And the emergent 
property is your behavior, right? Those cells are connected  in a certain way which 
results in the way that you think and feel, your emotions, your behavior, etc. 

And in brain research we now have learned that the way these cells are connected is 
influenced by the learning environment for young children. How the brain is 
stimulated influences how these are connected. So there's a feedback between the 
environment experienced by a child and how these connections are made. Similarly 
in ecology systems and throughout evolution there's a feedback. 

You have a bunch of cells doing a certain kind of metabolism which changes the 
atmosphere of the p lanet. And then that atmosphere selects for certain types of cells 
that weren't there before. So there's a constant feedback between the emergent 
property feeding back on the system level below and changing it. And that's really 
the characteristics of a complex system. And we'll ta lk about, in a minute, some 

major examples of that. One that I a lways like to think about and throw out is that if 
you knew everything, did any of you have an ant colony when you were a kid? Ah, 
you're deprived. 

Oh, yes. OK. You get the sand and the two pieces of glass and you put some ants in 
and they make all these tunnels and everything. So if you knew everything about 
ants and ant behavior and sand and the mechanics of sand could you ever pred ict 
the pattern of those tunnels that they're going to build? Actua lly, most of the classes 
I talk to say yeah. If I knew all that I could pred ict it. But think about it. OK. Because 
I don't think you could. 

And this whole field of complexity theory is really explod ing now. In  fact, 
Northwestern University, I just noticed on the Web, has just formed an entire school 
of complexity that has people from a ll different fields under one roof, social sciences 
all the way to physics under one roof studying this phenomenon. And ecology is 
complexity at its best. OK. So one other thing, before we move on, is that I sa id 
ecology is not environmenta lism, but it's a fundamenta l science. 

But the knowledge that  is gained  from the study of ecological systems and  the 
principles of ecology, that knowledge is used in a field that is grow ing now called 
applied ecology. And that's where you use ecologica l knowledge to influence human 
activities on Earth. And, for example, you'd use ecological know ledge to understand 
how much of the Earth's forests can we cut down before the system won't sustain us, 
that you won't have enough photosynthesis to maintain the oxygen levels in the 
atmosphere or draw down enough CO2 so that we don't a ll boil up. 

We'll ta lk about that. If you want to protect a particular species, how large of an area 
do you have to set aside as a  reserve? In order to know that you have to do 
fundamenta l studies of the ecology of that species. Basically, how far can we, as 
humans, push these systems from their "natural state" until they won't function for 
us anymore? Because we rely on natura l systems for food, fiber and clean water and 
the composition of our air. 

But another point here, I just said how far from  the natura l state can we push them, 
another big important point, as we ta lk about ecologica l systems, is there  is no 
orig ina l state of nature. There is no baseline. Nature is ever-chang ing. Nature is 
evolving. And we'll talk about how much the Earth has evolved since the formation of 
the Earth. So it's important to keep in mind that what humans are doing now, as we 
try to have conservation programs and worry about globa l warming and the 
extinction of species, is that we're trying to keep the Earth the way we think we want 
it right now. 

I mean the way we think it was before the Industria l Revolution, before the massive 
flux of energy into the system has allowed us to comp letely change the b iosphere. 
And that's a  rea lly important thing because the Earth "has a mind" of its own. And 
we know that, it doesn't have a mind, it has a behavior of its own. And we know that 
there were massive climate changes in the past and there will be massive climate 
changes in the future. 

And asteroid might hit us. And who knows a ll of these things? It's going to change. 
So our challenge is understanding the degree to which we want to try to control that 
natural change and try to not impose rapid change in the rates of things that are 
already going on. So it's a very tricky problem, and you guys are the ones that are 

going to inherit it big time. You're going to be in charge of this biosphere and you're 
going to have to figure out how to manage it, because, like it or not, we are 
influencing it to such a degree that we have to manage it. 

OK. So another important concept is that, and  I've a lready a lluded to this,  the 
organism environment interaction is two-way. I mean we're all used to thinking 
about the "survival of the fittest", right? That you have this environment out there 
and you have organisms, and the organism that's more fit, has most adapted to  that 
environment will survive and reproduce and that's how evolution works. 

Well, it's more than that. The important thing is that not only do organisms adapt to 
the environment but they actually change the environment. They co-evolve w ith the 
environment. And so life in the non- living components of the Earth are interacting 
very intimately and life has fundamentally shaped the nature of the non-living part of 
our planet. So an examp le of this that I draw  from your textbook, just a very simple 
example, has to do w ith the influence of microbes on the succession of plants in a 
northern ecosystem. 

Succession is -- If you start w ith b lank soil and you just let it sit, how will 
communities of organisms come in and colonize? You'll start out w ith very small 
plants and then  larger plants and  then bushes and then trees over time. So 
sometimes ecolog ists study this by clear-cutting an area and then following it over 
time. That takes years and years and years, much longer than the average scientist's 
lifespan. 

So another way to do this is substitute space for time. And that's what they've done 
here. This is a glacier that is reced ing in this direction. And so where it initially 
retreated soil was exposed and succession started. And then it retreats more. So  this 
area is grow ing while this one is just getting exposed. So eventua lly, along this 
gradient, you have the youngest community up here and the oldest community down 
here. 

And so they were ab le to look at the effect of that succession of different species on 
the composition of the soil. And there's an important successiona l stage here. So 
here's the nitrogen content in the soil as a function of simulated time here and 
show ing that it increases stead ily as succession goes on up to a peak and then levels 
off. 

And that increase is largely due to the invasion of plants that can fix nitrogen. Alder 
trees are a specific species of trees that have in their roots symb iotic nitrogen-fixing 
bacteria. Have you talked about this at all, nitrogen-fixation? This is what Professor 
Walker actually works on his research in his laboratory. He's a world expert on the 
mechanism of this. But these nitrogen-fixing microbes are the only forms of life 
really that can take nitrogen gas from the atmosphere, N2, and using this 
nitrogenase enzyme convert it to ammonia which is what they need to make 
proteins, etc. 

So there's this huge reservoir of nitrogen gas in the atmosphere, and only through 
these microbes can we get that into the soil so  that other organisms can use it. So 
here's a process at the molecular level where the b iochemistry that you're learning in 
the rest of this class sca led up actually comp letely influences the species that inhabit 
this ecosystem by  increasing the nitrogen in the soil. 

And just to show you how important these microbes are globa lly, this is the g lobal 
nitrogen cycle. And don't worry about the details because we're going to ta lk about 
this in  future lectures in b ig deta il. So this is just to make the simple point that 
here's this biolog ica l nitrogen fixation on a g loba l scale. We have to start ta lking 
about big units here, OK? This is gigatons of nitrogen. 

So I've converted it. A g igaton of nitrogen is equal in weight to a billion 
Volkswagens. So you have to think on an annual sca le 140 billion Volkswagens worth 
of nitrogen is dragged out of the atmosphere and put into  living organisms by the 
biochemica l processes that you're learning about at the subcellular level. So massive 
quantities of stuff is flying around here that you cannot appreciate until you see it. 

Now, if there was no life on Earth, that nitrogen cycle wouldn't be a cycle. None of 
these processes would work w ithout the microbes. And we're going to  talk about 
them in much more detail later. OK. The other really important cycle on Earth is the 
carbon cycle. And so I've put this up here to very simply -- Now, you've talked about 
these reactions in the biochemical sense in great deta il. 

This is what I call my impressionistic biochemistry, a ll right? The net reaction of 
photosynthesis  is to take CO2 gas from the atmosphere using water, using solar 
energy and convert it to organic carbon. Think of this as g lucose. Multiply that by six 
and you've got glucose organic carbon and oxygen is evolved. So this is what we call 
the "mass from gas reaction" on a globa l scale. This is the foundation of a ll life on 
Earth. 

Without  it there would be no life. L ife was created from these g igatons of CO2 in the 
atmosphere and the solar energy. And then the reverse, of course, is all of the 
anima ls and bacteria, a ll of the things that cannot photosynthesis use this organic 
carbon and use oxygen and burn it in respiration, that you've learned about, to make 
chemical energy [as heat?] and cycling the gas back. Now, in order for this to run, I 
love that part. 

That took me about ten minutes to  figure out. This  is that all the other elements on 
Earth need to cycle through. And it's microbes that do this cycling. And we're going 
to talk about that in the next lecture. Because the system would  run down if the 
elements on Earth weren't cycled by microbes through various redox states. So this 
is just a more deta iled scaled down version of what you've a lready learned in class, 
photosynthesis, the Z scheme, making glucose from the Calvin Cycle. 

And then that glucose goes into the mitochondrion. And you have respiration and 
CO2 evolved. So this is the micro sca le version of what I just showed you and this  is 
the macro scale version of what I just showed you. This is the g lobal carbon cycle. 
And you have a hundred gigatons of carbon coming into the system through 
photosynthesis and going out through respiration. 

So that's the collective photosynthesis and  resp iration metabolism of the Earth. What 
I'm trying to have you get a feeling for here is that this whole phenomenon of 
sca ling, that these processes occur at multiple scales from the subcellular to the 
biosphere level. And this is the flat Earth version of the g lobe. In the northern 
hemisphere you can see winter. 

There's w inter, no green. There's summer, everything green. Winter, no green. 
Summer, everything green. And now wait until you see this. This is cool. Because 

that pulsing you can actually see. This is the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere 
over a period of three years or so showing that when respiration is greater than 
photosynthesis  in the northern hemisphere in the winter, CO2 in the atmosphere 
goes up. 

When photosynthesis is greater respiration, CO2 goes down. So you can see the 
signature of the Earth breathing in the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Also 
you can see that this  is increasing. And does anybody know why that is? Hello. D id 
somebody say something? G loba l warming, yeah. Greenhouse effect, yeah. But 
what's causing that? There you go, fossil fuel. Burning  fossil fuel is causing an 
increasing trend in the CO2 concentration which is causing the greenhouse effect 
which is causing globa l warming. 

And we'll ta lk about that. This is an emergent property of the system, the CO2 
concentration. Now,  in the last slide I showed you these arrows were the same 
width. But life on Earth was not a lways that way. Resp iration didn't always ba lance 
photosynthesis. And this gets to my point about there's no orig inal state of nature. 
In the early Earth, photosynthesis way outpaced the consumption of organic matter. 

So what would that result in? If this arrow is much more rapid than this arrow? 
Oxygen in the atmosphere increased, exactly. Now, if oxygen in the atmosphere 
increases, what happens? What else happens  in order for that to happen? This 
increased, too, right? And,  in fact,  that is the deposition of fossil fuel. This is billions 
of years. Now we're going back to the formation of the Earth 4. 

5 b illion years ago, orig in of life. Then we have the beginning of oxygenic 
photosynthesis here. And it's the phytop lankton  in the oceans that started this. And 
so oxygen started to accumulate  in the oceans but not  in the atmosphere at first. So 
you have a ll this photosynthesis in the oceans which were a very reduced 
environment. So the minute the oxygen was evolved in photosynthesis it reacted 
with iron, all these reduced compounds, particularly iron, and made  iron oxides. 

So it never made it to the atmosphere at first. So you had the deposition of these 
banded iron formations in the ancient marine environment. Then eventually all of 
that got oxidized and it escaped into the atmosphere and you started to have a 
buildup of oxygen in the atmosphere. And at the same time that was building up 
there was burial of this organic carbon because it wasn't being respired by the 
heterotrophic organisms. 

And that's the fossil fuel that was built up over a ll of these billions of years. Well, not 
billions. Yeah, b illions of years. That we have now burned over a period of a hundred 
years releasing all that CO2 into  the atmosphere. So we're burning ancient 
photosynthate over a tiny little period in the Earth's history and throwing it into the 
atmosphere. And the Earth is saying I don't know how  to hand le this. 

So there's a big question of what the Earth's system is going to do w ith all of that 
CO2 that we're putting up there. And this is all going to happen in like the next 50 
years. And, as I always say in this class, I'll be dead but you won't when it rea lly hits 
the fan unless we do something. So here are the banded iron formations. We can see 
the legacy of that history of the Earth in today's rock formations, banded iron 
formations of marine origin and terrestria l origin here. 

And we can see in the Earth's composition of the Earth's atmosphere the signature of 
the evolution of life. The composition of the Earth's atmosphere is highly improbable. 
Thermodynamica lly improbab le  if you didn't have the influence of converting this 
solar energy into living biomass. And so the CO2 concentration is much  lower than 
these planets. 

And the nitrogen concentration higher and the temperature a nice balmy 16 degrees. 
OK. So this is just to remind you that these processes operate at a ll sca les. 
Biosphere. This is a little ecosphere I'm going to bring next time showing you a 
sealed ecosystem in which all of these properties go on. And finally. So I've been 
talking about levels of organization from the molecular level up to the b iosphere 
level. 

And there's an exciting new thing happening in my field that is so exciting I have to 
tell you about it. And I'll probably be telling you about it more and more as I go 
along here. And that is a whole new field is emerging called molecular ecology where 
we're view ing the biosphere as a network of genes. It's not that you either study 
cellular molecular biology or biochemistry or you study the biosphere but you try to 
think of the biosphere as a network of genes. 

And in oceanography we're actually able to start to do this because the oceans are 
dominated by microorganisms, although in this picture I don't have that properly 
represented, but we're starting to think about a sea of organisms as being simp ly a 
network of genes. Most of the genetic information in the oceans is in 
microorganisms. And I like to think of the oceans as dissolved information 
essentia lly. 

When you look out and you see that b lue water, there is so much DNA in there and 
so many genes doing so many different things it's just phenomenal. And there are a 
billion microbes per liter in sea water. 99.9% have never been cultivated. We know 
nothing about them. There is as much information in that liter as in the entire human 
genome, and most of it is of unknown function in this biosphere. 

And so just within the last year, this is Craig Venter who was one of the people who 
sequenced the human genome. And now that that's over w ith, he needs a new 
cha llenge. So he's taking on the ocean genome meaning sequencing a ll of the DNA in 
the oceans. And he's taken his yacht, because he's rich now, which is his research 
vessel. And they're going around the oceans collecting samples, filtering them onto 
filters and collecting a ll the microbes. 

And then you take it and you grind it up, you extract the DNA and you sequence it. 
And you just get a bunch of little pieces that you identify as genes. You don't know 
what organisms they belong to, but you've got genes. And this is his cruise trek 
which you notice doesn't have many northern climes here, a lthough they did do 
something up in Ha lifax. 

And it kind of resemb les the Cha llenger Exped ition back in the 1800s which was one 
of the first major oceanographic expeditions. So they published a paper in Science 
last year. Just off Bermuda they found 1.2 million new genes that had never been in 
the database. They had  to create a new database in order to even put these genes in 
it and 1800 new species. And he is estimating the genetic inventory of the planet, 
most of which are in these microbes, to be 20 to 30 b illion genes. 

And then we're going to have to figure out what they're a ll doing. OK. So just the 
take-home message. I'm going to try to do this at the end of each lecture so that 
you know what I think is important. So we've ta lked about life at different scales. 
Ecology is the study of life at all these different sca les. Emergent properties is a 
really important concept to understand. 

There's nothing more important than understanding this organism environment  is a 
two-way street. There's rea lly no such thing as a free living organism either. They 
are a ll dependant on one another. Even if you have a culture of say E. coli which 
you've supplied glucose to so it can grow, where do you think that g lucose came 
from? It's the photosynthetic product of some plant somewhere. 

So organisms are not rea lly free-living. They are all dependent on one another. Life 
has shaped the Earth's features, its atmosphere. The b iosphere that I've shown you 
and the geosphere, which  is what we refer to the nonliving part of the Earth, have 
coevolved over evolutionary time. And the genetic inventory of this is completely 
unknown. And, of course, microbes rule the planet, donâ€™t forget that. See you next 
time.
