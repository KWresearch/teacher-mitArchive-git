<p></p>
<p>Let's get started. So I'm going to finish up energy today. And then  we're going to begin sort of section more or less we'll call it  molecular biology but it's sort of dealing with the issues that revolve  around the discovery that DNA was the genetic material and then working  through how people understood how information got from the DNA into  everything else, how things were regulated. There are an incredibly  large number of important discoveries that form the foundation of how we  think about biology that are going to come out in this next section,  but before I do that I just want to finish up this section that I talked  to you about, about energy.</p>
<p>And I hope as we go along here you're  going to see how some of these sort of disparate parts of the course  begin to come together. Almost everything we're going to be talking  about now is going to be needing energy such as replicating DNA or  making proteins and all sorts of things. And those are driven ultimately  by ATP. And what I've been trying to talk to about for the last lecture  or two is how the cell gets the ATP, the energy money that it needs to  make things.</p>
<p>We talked through glycolysis, this ancient, ancient  way of getting a couple of ATPs out of a molecule of sugar so  well-imbedded in our genetic makeup it's in almost all organisms. And  then I talked last lecture about this other principle which must have  come up very, very early in evolution. Again, it's used by all  organisms. And that's the principle of capturing the energy that's  inherent in a proton gradient across a membrane.</p>
<p>And I talked to  you then about the idea then the way it worked was that the cell would  have something in its membrane that would be a proton pump and it would  pump the proton from one side of the membrane to the other. So it's  working against the gradient. So it's doing energy. So there are a  couple of different ways energy needs to be provided. It could be  provided by some kind of light energy, and that's what drives  photosynthesis.</p>
<p>I'll say a few words about that. Or in the case of  respiration with the oxidative phosphorylation, I showed you how it was  the electrons sort of descend in stepwise fashion down from one state  to another. There's energy given off, free energy is available, and that  can be used to power the pump. And once the proton gradient is made  then the cells can turn it around and use the energy that's in that  proton gradient to make ATP.</p>
<p>So in respiration remember the trick  was then to take those two pyruvates, burn them all the way down to  carbon dioxide and water, make as many ATPs and NADHs as you could, then  take the NADHs, use them to make a proton gradient and eventually, if  you will, convert everything into ATP so you've got it as energy. Our  cells do it. That part, respiration and the oxidative phosphorylation is  done in mitochondria, which I said sort of came from bacteria that were  captured at some point.</p>
<p>Here's a picture of a mitochondrion. It  still looks more or less like a bacterium. And I showed you the little  parts that are in there. It was funny. Right after lecture I went back  to my lab. I picked up a recent issue of Science. And I opened up to a  page that said something about rats that had been bred to be very poor  at aerobic exercise.</p>
<p>And it went on to talk about the health  problems they had. And there was a sentence in there that they think the  underlying cause is by breeding these rats and selection for rats that  are poor at doing aerobic exercise. What they think it all stems from is  having very inefficient mitochondria that don't work nearly as well.  And that would make a lot of sense. I was going to scan that article but  we had some technical issues this morning.</p>
<p>Maybe I can show it to  you next lecture. OK. So the one last thing then that I want to do is I  want to say a few words about photosynthesis because that actually  preceded respiration. Respiration couldn't evolve until there was oxygen  in the atmosphere. So probably the first use or certainly one of the  first uses of the proton gradient happened in this scale of evolution  and put here somewhere maybe 3.</p>
<p>4 billion years ago or so when  what I had called photosynthesis -- -- release I on day one in the sort  of trivial fashion. This is known as cyclic -- -- photo phosphorylation.  And the principle is relatively simple. It's to capture the energy in  sunlight -- -- to make a proton gradient. And that then can be used, as  you now know, to make ATP. So in order to capture energy from sunlight  nature had to evolve molecules that are able to absorb in the  appropriate wavelength range.</p>
<p>You know the names of those  molecules. Chlorophyll come in two principle species. You don't have to  remember the structure. What you can see is a lot of conjugated  double-bonds. That's how you sort of tune the absorption of a molecule.  If you want to make it absorb a longer and longer wavelength you start  hooking together double bonds. And you can set it up sort of you can get  a molecule to absorb at just about any maximum absorption, any  wavelength you want.</p>
<p>So chlorophyll is able to absorb this energy.  And the principle of this is what happens. You have this chlorophyll  and it absorbs a photon. And an electron gets excited so it basically  moves to another orbital. It's farther away from the nucleus. It's  easier now for that electron to get lost than it was before. Now, if  nothing was happening that electron would eventually just fall down to  its ground state and you'd lose all the energy as heat.</p>
<p>So what  happens in photosynthesis, though, is that the electron falls back down  to the ground state again in a series of steps. And how this happens,  electrons are basically getting passed from one carrier to another. And  the same principle as we saw in respiration applies in that at each  phase in here a proton is pumped. Now, the out and the in are reversed  from what it says in respiration.</p>
<p>You have notes on respiration,  or should anyway. But the in and the out, as you'll see, it's sort of an  arbitrary. You sort of take a frame of reference and then something's  in and something's out. The point is that in both of them protons go  from one side of the membrane to the other and you get more on one side,  you pump them in one direction and they flow back in the other.</p>
<p>And  the in and the out is sort of an arbitrary way of describing what's  happening, but in both cases the key thing is that you're pumping  electrons out. And then these can be used to make ATP, as we talked  about with ATP synthesis. In this case the electrons eventually end up  back on the chlorophyll. And so that's why it's called cyclic  phosphorylation.</p>
<p>What you get out of this, as you can see, is ATP.  So this was probably a really big deal in evolution because the current  thinking is perhaps there was an RNA world that's still sort of being  debated. At some point it's clear that somewhere around 3.8 billion  years or so something that looks sort of like a present-day bacterium  arose, probably ate molecules that had already been made in the sort of  primordial soup, but when those started to run out then it needed other  ways of making energy.</p>
<p>It needed other ways of making carbon.  Here's a way of getting energy, but what's available to make more  organic molecules is only carbon dioxide. And if you remember that  little thing I showed you of if we're going from a methyl to a hydroxyl  to an aldehyde to an acid -- -- to CO2, that direction is oxidation and  that direction is reduction. So if we go in that direction and we end up  generating NADH because we're taking electrons and giving them to  something else, if we want to go the other way if we're starting with  C02 what we need to do is we need to have a supply of reducing power so  we can take the C02 and get it down to all the less-oxidized states that  are necessary for building all the molecules that we've been talking  about.</p>
<p>So making ATP was a great idea, but the cell still needed  to have some form of reducing agent. And what they used was they used  hydrogen sulfide. This is at least one of the major ways that it was  done. And so there is a very slight twist here. This is NADP. It's the  same molecule as NAD except there's an extra phosphorylation. And the  one with the phosphate on it tends to be used in biosynthetic reactions,  but otherwise it's exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>It's an electron  banking thing. And what this gave was NADPH plus sulfur plus a hydrogen.  So sulfur is a waste product. Here's the reducing power. Here's the  ATP. That's what those organisms need to be able to synthesize new  organic material without having to have pre-made molecules. A really big  deal in evolution. And the idea for making ATP is based on this use of  establishing a proton gradient, the same principle we've seen again.</p>
<p>Now,  there's another possible source of reducing power, and that would be to  use water as the source of the reducing power. But in order to do that  you've got to put more energy into it. And this system wasn't able to  handle it. But that happened soon enough with the development of what I  called on the first day photosynthesis release II, which is technically  known as noncyclic photophosphorylation.</p>
<p>Again, it uses the energy  of sunlight. But the twist this time, it not only makes ATP, it also  makes NADPH, it makes reducing power at the same time. So you can see  that is a really major advance. If you can use sunlight to make both of  them now you're really efficient. So this is how this one works. It's  related to the other one. And the first part is more or less the same  idea.</p>
<p>A photon is absorbed by a molecule of chlorophyll. It kicks  the chlorophyll up to an activated state where the electrons are at a  higher orbital far away. It wants to come back down. Energy is going to  be released. So electrons gets passed, protons get pumped from one side  of a membrane to another. Except this time, instead of coming back this  lands in a different chlorophyll that has just recently lost a pair of  electrons.</p>
<p>But there's a new energy input here that kicks this  chlorophyll up to an even higher energy state than this one. And as  these electrons start to come down the energy hill there's enough energy  here to take a molecule of NADP+ plus a hydrogen ion and give NADPH.  There's one thing that this isn't going to work like a cycle or a  machine yet. Anybody see what hasn't been taken care of yet? Say again.</p>
<p>Send  the electrons back to this chlorophyll, exactly. However, the way the  energetics are structured now the cells were able to take reducing power  from here and generate 2H+ plus a half of an oxygen molecule. And this  would really be two waters giving four hydrogens and one oxygen  molecule. So what you can see here now, there are a couple of really  important things about this.</p>
<p>It needs more energy. It makes ATP  and NADPH which leaves the cell able to carry out biosynthesis. And the  third thing, which is an incredible influence on our planet, it started  to generate oxygen as a waste product. And it's really a mixed blessing.  I mean oxygen is very reactive. It damages our DNA. It damages our  proteins. We have an amazing number of defenses against oxygen. But, on  the other hand, as it accumulated in the atmosphere and organisms slowly  over evolutionary time learned to deal with it, it then set us up for  the possibility of respiration which, as you can see, is 18 times more  efficient than in that ancient way of using glycolysis to make energy  out of sugars.</p>
<p>So that's more or less the story. This part is  called photosystem II. This assembly of stuff is photosystem I. And I  just wanted to show you this next slide because chlorophyll isn't just  floating around like this. As you might guess, it's bound into proteins  and things. And someone has figured out the structure of photosystem I.  It consists of 12 proteins, 96 chlorophylls and about 30 other  molecules.</p>
<p>And what it really does is it functions as an antenna.  Some of the other molecules can absorb it at wavelengths that are  different from chlorophyll. And all the energy gets funneled into the  chlorophyll and into this process. And you'll probably recognize by now  that proteins here we're seeing alpha helices and beta sheets in here as  part of this structure. So the first organisms that learned how to do  this were organisms we now know as cyanobacteria.</p>
<p>They're a kind  of bacteria that has two membranes like E. coli and like the other ones  that we've talked about. You're familiar with these. There's the green  scum you see on ponds. Here's a close-up. Sometimes they grow as  filaments, the cells in a chain. You notice they're green. They're  making chlorophyll. And what happened in plants was that apparently  something probably related to the present-day cyanobacteria got trapped  inside some early progenitor of what we now know as plants and green  algae.</p>
<p>And this trapped bacterium became a chloroplast. And it had  all the machinery necessary to carry out this noncyclic  photophosphorylation. The structure of these things, there's an outer  membrane. Just similar to what I told you for the mitochondria. There's  an inner membrane. And what's special about the mitochondrion then,  there's another membrane inside that's known as the thylocoid.</p>
<p>And  that's where all the chlorophyll is. And the reason the out and the in  is a little bit confusing in here is this part, which is probably the  cytoplasm of the old bacterium, is pumped from what's known as the  stroma of a chloroplast which is equivalent to the cytoplasm of the  original bacteria into the lumen. So the chlorophyll that's in this  membrane absorbs the light, pumps protons into the lumen building up a  proton gradient, and then they flow back out in the other direction and  make ATP.</p>
<p>Here's a picture of a chloroplast once again. It looks  an awful lot like the bacterium still that got captured. All this stuff  on the inside, those are the thylocoid membranes that carry out this  specialized stuff. So there you have it. That's how cells, the major  ways that life has figured out how to make energy. When Penny Chisholm  starts to talk to you she'll talk to you about how organisms adapt to  various niches, things that live in the bottom of the ocean, things that  live in various places.</p>
<p>They all have to make energy. Well, they  all use some variation on these principles I've talked to you about. And  she'll then show you how they're very clever at extracting energy out  of all sorts of things by applying these principles in different ways.  OK. So what we're going to start doing now is we're going to start  talking about DNA. This is certainly a molecule that's fascinated me all  my life. You should know from the first part that it's built up of  units known as nucleotides that have a sugar.</p>
<p>It's a ribose sugar  that's missing one hydroxyl so it's a deoxyribose. The sugars are  numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I showed you that. There'll be a phosphate. And  then one of these nucleic acid bases, either a pyrimidine or a purine.  And in DNA you find the pyrimidine bases are cytosine and thymine. And  in DNA the purine bases are adenine and guanine. And then these subunits  are polymerized together.</p>
<p>In essence, splitting out water to give  you a polymer. And I didn't emphasize this too strong the first time I  showed it to you. It's going to become a very big deal over the next few  lectures as we begin to consider how nature had to figure out how to  replicate DNA and all sorts of implications to go along with this, but  there's a polarity to a strand of DNA. This is what's called the 5 prime  sugar.</p>
<p>The primes indicate the numbers referring to the sugar,  and the ones without primes are referring to numbers of atoms that make  up part of the nucleic acid base. So if we're looking at a chain, this  is a 5 prime carbon of the sugar, that's the 3 prime. And so what you  can see, this bond which is really a phosphodiester bond, the phosphate  group has formed an ester with this hydroxyl and with the hydroxyl that  used to be here.</p>
<p>So it's a phosphodiester bond and it's a 5 prime,  3 prime bond. It joins the 5 prime carbon to the 3 prime carbon up  here. So that means if you're looking at a chain of DNA, if you come  down this way you're coming in the 5 to 3 prime direction. If we come up  the other way we're coming from the 3 prime end heading towards the 5  prime end.</p>
<p>So you'll see me saying 5 prime, 3 prime. Now, as I  told you, the principle force that holds the strands of the DNA together  are hydrogen bonds, three of them between a G and a C and two of them  between an A and a T. And then they are a pair of strands. And they're  actually running in opposite polarities. This is something to contend  with when we think about replication. 5 prime to 3 prime in one  direction and 5 prime to 3 prime going in the opposite way here.</p>
<p>And  then, as you all know, it's called the double helix. So it's actually  not flat like this in space. It's in a 3-dimensional twisted into a  double helix and the base pairs are held together by hydrogen bonds  between the bases on the opposite strands down the middle of the  molecule. And I like this little movie I showed you because you can see  it pretty well. The nitrogens are blue.</p>
<p>It's easy to see the  bases. And the hydrogen bonds are right in the middle. There's another  force I didn't mention and it doesn't matter for this course, but when  the bases sort of stack on top of each other there's actually a kind of  extra stabilization that comes from that. It's a gorgeous molecule. You  all know it encodes the genetic information. We're going to be talking  about it a lot, but first thing, you know, I could just tell you it's  the genetic information.</p>
<p>But one of the really big discoveries in  biology was that DNA is the genetic information. And a point I'm trying  to help you learn here, you know, I'm trying to teach you more than just  facts. And I hope some of you at least will catch that. I'm trying to  show you how biology is done. As an experimental scientist you don't sit  down usually and figure it out. Instead you start doing experiments and  you get all kinds of unexpected discoveries.</p>
<p>And, in general, as  people work in these unexpected discoveries ultimately they come to  these grand new insights that, you know, sometimes would have been very  hard to forget. So the real question that people wondered for a long  time, and we'll talk more about the history of genetics, but people knew  we clearly had inheritable traits. You could see it in your kids.</p>
<p>People  had been breeding plants and all sorts of things. Breeding domestic  animals. They sort of understood the principle of inheritance. When I  tell you about Mendel we'll begin to see how his thinking led to the  idea that the inheritance wasn't just sort of like a liquid where  everything mixed together. It came in units or particles which we know  of as genes. And so the idea of genes had been accepted certainly by the  beginning of this century anyway, but nobody knew what they were made  of.</p>
<p>They were made of -- The major properties that they had was  they clearly encoded information in some way. They must replicate  because one cell could give two and on and on and on. So if you were  going to pass it down in an inherited way they have to be replicated.  And the third thing was that people knew somehow they could mutate or  the information content that they encoded could be changed.</p>
<p>Again,  you could see that, that you'd get something, an altered  characteristic, and then it would be propagated down through that line.  That was the principle of breeding that people had done for ages. And so  they understood that. There was one other key thing they knew. They  knew that these genes were in the nucleus. And I'll tell you the full  story of how even that insight was arrived at.</p>
<p>But I'll just show  you for the moment this little movie. This shows some chromosomes that  are all bunched up and are just pulled apart at the time of the cell  division. Those chromosomes, as we now know, are made of DNA. But in  essence what people had seen through the microscope was these  chromosomes or colored things that they could stain.</p>
<p>They could  sort of see something had doubled. And just before the cell divided the  two sets separated and each cell got a new set. So that's about what  people knew. They had those properties. They're in the nucleus. They  knew about as much as you do. They knew the major classes of  biomolecules in a cell. So what do you think you would need to do to  show that DNA is the genetic material, encodes the genes? Find somebody  near you.</p>
<p>I'll give you a minute or so. I'd like to hear what kind  of ideas you come up with. Then I'll tell you how it happened. But I  want to hear. Why don't you think about it and just see if you can come  up with a couple ideas for me, what you'd need to figure out. Well,  let's just see what kind of ideas anybody got. If you wanted to make me  believe that DNA is doing that, or I think it's a protein for the  moment, that's what I think is most likely, but what you do think?  Anybody got an idea? Mess up the DNA and see if we can mess up the cell.</p>
<p>How  are we going to do that? I can break a cell open and I guess I can  purify DNA and I can analyze it. And it's got four bases in it and it's  got sugars and phosphates. At that point nobody could sequence DNA. We  didn't even know the structure. Yeah? Take it out of one cell and put it  into another. And what would you expect to happen then? OK.</p>
<p>That's  a really nice idea. Somehow if you took the DNA and moved it from one  cell to another that the characteristic of this cell would be somehow  carried over. OK. That's in fact the way it happened but not as simply  as that, as I'll tell you, but that's exactly the essence of it. One  little problem. Maybe we'll see if anybody has a thought on this. If I  purify DNA, I mean nothing's ever really pure, right? You get it out and  there's always little bits of stuff.</p>
<p>And someone can always  argue, well, yeah, it's 99% DNA, but it's the other bits you cannot get  rid of. Yeah? If you used radioactive material, how is that going to  help us? It does contain nitrogen. Well, it gets a little complicated.  Certainly nucleic acids have like phosphate in them, but so does RNA.  That's going to be hard. Maybe if I had a mixture of things and I wanted  to prove whether something was let's say DNA, a protein or something,  you need some really specific way of saying I did something to the DNA  and not to the protein or something like that.</p>
<p>Have you heard  anything in this course that is really specific? Enzymes. Do you think  that'd give you an idea of how you might do it? If I've got a tube and  it's mostly DNA and maybe a bit of protein and something, and let's say  his idea is working, that we can take the DNA from this cell and put it  over into the second cell and see the characteristic change, if I wanted  to do something to show that it was the DNA in the tube that was  responsible, could you use an enzyme? And what kind of enzyme would you  want? Well, what characteristics would you like it to have? Nature's  probably made it for you already.</p>
<p>Something that synthesizes DNA?  Something that breaks down DNA? Say I treated this tube with some kind  of enzyme and then I wanted to see the outcome, what would we want, an  enzyme that did what? Anybody else got an idea? You're asserting that  it's the DNA in my prep, I like your idea, but I need to prove it so I  need to do something to show that it's actually the DNA and not the  other stuff.</p>
<p>So if I had an enzyme that did what to DNA? If I  broke it down, yeah. We could treat it. And if your idea is right, we  treat the stuff with something that specifically breaks down DNA it  won't get transferred. Does that make sense? OK. I mean that's a way you  could go at a proof of this. And, in fact, that's what happened. But  I'm going to quickly tell you how it actually happened. And again, you  know, as I say, I'm trying to tell you a few things that are besides  here are the facts that you need to know on exam.</p>
<p>There's a bigger  picture here and this is how research goes, and particularly in an  experimental science such as biology. The important early work on this  came from a guy who was known as Frederick Griffith. He was in London.  He was a physician. He was working in the 1920s. And he was studying  pneumonia. That's an infection of the lungs -- -- by bacteria.</p>
<p>There's  more than one kind of bacterium that will cause pneumonia, but one of  the really important ones clinically was streptococcus -- -- pneumonia.  So it was a bacterium. It was given that name. We all have bacteria on  us. I think I told you we have about ten to the twelfth on our skin, for  example. And if streptococcus is on your skin it's not a problem, but  if it gets into your lungs it's a problem.</p>
<p>And so to live with all  these bacteria with us our bodies have defenses. So we have this immune  system, we'll talk about more, and a bunch of defender cells. Things  that you know as white blood cells are defenders. Let's just see here.  I'm going to show you this little movie. This is one of your white blood  cells, a special kind of white blood cell.</p>
<p>That little thing it's  chasing is a bacterium. These round things are red blood cells. I mean  doesn't it look like a dog going after a mouse, or a cat going after  something? It's chasing it. It can tell it's there. This is remarkable.  And it's a little pixilated, but this is real. It's going to catch it  right about there. And it eats it. I mean we have these cells inside us.  That's why you don't die even though we live in a world that's  surrounded by bacteria.</p>
<p>OK, so we'll go on. So getting pneumonia  in those days was a really bad thing. You get infected, you get this in  your lungs, and then you have four to six days of high fever, and then  the patient would reach what's termed as a "crisis". And one of two  things would happen. They'd either live or they'd die. And that was it. I  mean this was no fun if somebody you knew had it because you didn't  know the outcome.</p>
<p>And the outcome wasn't necessarily very good.  Now you call up the doctor and they pump you full of antibiotics, but  antibiotics hadn't been discovered yet. So this was pretty serious  business, and people were trying to understand what was happening. But  what was going on during these four to six days that then led to one of  these two outcomes? Well, it turns out that streptococcus is a bacteria  like this.</p>
<p>So that's the bacterium. And it has around it something  known as a capsule. And that capsule is polysaccharide. Remember back  to the second lecture when I was confusing you all by showing you how  sugars could hook together in all a manner of different ways? Well,  that's what polysaccharides are. You just hook a bunch of sugars  together. And for this course you don't have to remember the linkages in  particular.</p>
<p>You just have to understand that there are different  kinds of linkages, and every time you hook at it in a different way you  get a different kind of polysaccharide out of it. But anyway, the  bacterium make this capsule of polysaccharide. And it's full of hydroxyl  groups from all those sugars so it attracts a lot of water around it.  And what it does is it causes a problem for those defender cells that we  just saw.</p>
<p>Those would be, for example, a macrophagic kind of  white blood cell. And it cannot eat something that's got the capsule.  Now, here's a picture of one of these capsules on one of these kinds of  bacteria. You can sort of see it out here. It's polysaccharide. That's  the main part of the bacterium. And here's another pixilated thing of  one of these white blood cells eating a bacterium that doesn't have a  capsule.</p>
<p>But watch what happens if the bacterium has a capsule. It  cannot get a hold of it. It just cannot quite grab hold of it. So what  happened during those days, though, was this capsule which is a foreign  entity to your body gets recognized in your immune system. And your  immune system made antibodies that could recognize that. We'll talk  about what these are, but all you need to know for the moment is that  they're proteins and they can be tuned to recognize some chemical entity  with a very, very high degree of specificity.</p>
<p>So what the body  was doing during this thing was trying to make antibodies that would  help it recognize this capsule. And then it decorates the capsule with  these things. And once it puts antibodies stuck all over the surface now  it can get a hold of it. And, again, a fact you don't have to know.  This whole process is called opsonization. The reason they use the word  opsin because opsin is the Greek word for seasoning.</p>
<p>And it was as  if these white blood cells liked to have their bacteria seasoned  correctly before they can eat them. And what's really going on is that  they're decorating them with antibodies. So what was going on after a  person got sick, it was a race between their immune system trying to  make antibodies which would let their immune system suppress the  infection and the bacterium which is replicating unchecked for the first  few days.</p>
<p>And that's why it was such a scary business, because  you didn't know what the outcome was and things could tip it one way or  the other. Well, this did suggest a kind of therapy. The kind of therapy  would be to isolate a capsule to inject a horse. Get the antibodies  from the horse. Why a horse? A horse is huge, right? It makes a lot of  antibodies. A lot better than injecting a mouse if you want to get  antibodies.</p>
<p>So get antibodies and then inject the patient. It's a  good idea in principle. So you're sort of short-circuiting this whole  process. The problem was there were more than 20 kinds of capsules. And  so what people had to do was they had to isolate the bacterium -- --  from the patient, determine the type of capsule. Let's say it's sort of  from capsule 1 up to capsule type 20, which one it was, and then inject  the correct antibody.</p>
<p>So this was nerve-racking because it took a  while for the bacteria to grow so it was a pretty tight time window. And  if you saw the patient right away that's good, but if they were partway  down the infection not so good. So the one other thing to do this, they  didn't bother all the way to isolate the capsule. What they would  usually do is use heat-killed bacteria and then you'd have the capsule  and everything.</p>
<p>The bacterium is dead, it cannot do anything, and  they'd inject the horse with that. And that would get you the antibodies  with the capsule. So what Griffith was doing was he was fiddling around  with this system. And there was one other discovery that he made.  Perhaps it wouldn't surprise you that since the bacteria surrounded by a  molecule absorbs water that the capsules would look sort of glistening.</p>
<p>They  absorbed a lot of water. You can see how they look here. So what they  discovered was if they have a capsule you get what are called smooth  colonies. And the word colony in this thing just refers to it started  out as one bacterium and it kept dividing and dividing and dividing. And  maybe there are ten to the eighth or ten to the ninth bacteria in that  little colony. But you can see it.</p>
<p>They've all got capsules on the  outside so it attracts a lot of water and it looks wet. And those are  what you saw. But what they found is if you waited or grew the cultures  up that you would see some things that looked dry or they called them  rough. And these turned out to be bacteria that lacked a capsule. And so  if you might start with a smooth strain S here and then isolate from it  a rough strain it might designate it in that kind of way.</p>
<p>So this  is the sort of thing that Griffith was fooling around with. So he  started with doing this kind of experiment. He took a smooth strain  making a capsule type two, OK? So he was injecting a mouse with this.  And what happened was the mouse was dead. This was a virulent form of  the bacterium. So if he took the rough mutant, injected the mouse, the  mouse is alive and you saw why. If it doesn't have a capsule, the mouse  has defender cells and white blood cells could eat it.</p>
<p>Then he had  heat-killed S3. So this was a strain of streptococcus that had a  different capsule, a type 3 capsule, but it was heat-killed. Why was he  working with heat-killed stuff? Because that's what you injected the  horses with to get it. So what do you think would happen here? Since the  bacteria are dead, probably not a big surprise the mouse is alive.</p>
<p>Now,  I don't know whether he did this on purpose or he did it as a control,  but what he did was he injected at the same time then R2 plus  heat-killed S3. So he's got two things that don't do anything, he  injects a mouse, and uh-oh, the mouse dies. That is a weird result. That  is actually also, though, the first really key step to understanding  that DNA is a genetic material. It doesn't look like it at this point  probably, but it was.</p>
<p>This is how we learned this really enormous  fact from these experiments. He wasn't trying to figure it out. He was  trying to work out something else, as you can see, but it was a bizarre  finding. So what would you think? I've put in something that used to  have a R2 capsule. So did it get rejuvenated somehow by this heat-killed  thing or, as you'd suggested, did some characteristic get transferred  from here or whatever? So he isolated the bacteria out of this, and what  he found now was he had a live bacterium that was making S3.</p>
<p>So  something had been transferred from this set of dead bacteria into  bacteria that were alive, and the characteristic had been passed from  the dead bacterium to the new bacterium, the other bacterium. So this is  about what Griffith did, but this problem was picked up by a scientist  at Rockefeller, Oswald Avery who worked as part of a team. And he took  this finding and started to work on it and tried to figure out, because  he saw in this result a way of finding out what was the genetic material  because somehow what was in that heat-killed S3 was the stuff that  would transfer genetic information into another bacterium.</p>
<p>So he  made one really big discovery. And that was you didn't need the mouse at  all. All that was happening was the mouse, by dying, was in essence  selecting for smooth bacteria. So he could simplify things by just  taking a rough bacteria, taking the heat-killed extract, putting it in,  and now he'd just look for smooth colonies. Didn't need any mice at all.  So he was able to see the characteristic of the capsule being  transferred from some kind of heat-killed mess of things into a rough  bacterium and changing it into a live bacterium.</p>
<p>So he started  fractionating, and he did exactly the kind of approach that you  suggested. And he purified and he purified and he purified using as his  assay this ability to pass on this smooth characteristic. And what he  ended up with was virtually pure DNA but, as I said, you know, always  never quite pure. And somebody can always argue, well, you've got a  little bit of something else in there.</p>
<p>So he did a really key  experiment and he treated with DNase, your experiment. And it lost the  transforming activity. So this process of doing this was called  transformation. Initially it described that phenomenon. Now that we know  what matters in the thing was taking DNA and putting it in. So if you  do a UROP somewhere here, you clone a piece of DNA into a plasma and you  stick it into E. coli so you can grow it up, that process of taking the  naked DNA and putting it inside the bacteria, you'll call it  transformation.</p>
<p>Now, in fact, this result wasn't accepted right  away. This was published in 1944. And the general realization that DNA  was the genetic material really didn't come until the `50s. Yet this  result proved it, if you will, but part of the problem was the world  wasn't yet ready to accept that DNA was a genetic material. And maybe  you can see the problem. It looked like a monotonous molecule.</p>
<p>It  only had four things that were different in it. And if you isolated they  were all often kind of there and about the same amount. People thought  it was just an analyst GATC. It didn't sound like anything had encoded  information. Proteins looked really attractive. Twenty different amino  acids that all had different characteristics, so that was a great place  for storing information. So the world wasn't quite ready to accept it,  even though the experimental evidence was there.</p>
<p>And so the result  came later. Now, the last thing I just want to show you, because  there's a kind of direct link from that Avery experiment to you guys  because a year or two ago it was the 50th anniversary of the discovery  of DNA. And Avery worked with a team of two other people called MacLeod  and McCarty. This was at the 50th anniversary, the meeting down at Cold  Spring Harbor celebrating it.</p>
<p>McCarty was the only member of the  team alive. There he was. I asked him to autograph my program. There was  his signature. He just died a little while ago, and so there's no  living connection to that anymore, but I have a picture to show you guys  that takes you back from that experiment to his signature right there.  OK? So I'll tell you some more stuff next lecture.</p>
