<p></p>
<p>Today we're going to start get into at least the nitty-gritty stuff  of the course. I think a point I want to, just to give you a very broad  perspective apart from why biology is interesting, I want to talk about  just very briefly how we study biology. I sort of talked about it the  other day by sort of the levels at which we could do it, from the  biosphere all the way down to the molecular level. But there is another  way of looking at it.</p> <p>And I just want to remind you of what I said  the other day. Biology is an experimental science What we know or think  we know at the moment is because of people having made observations,  designed hypotheses, tested them and so on. And what you're seeing is  sort of the sum of the current state of human knowledge when I'm talking  to you right now. There are various, two sort of major disciplines that  have been used to get at how biological function works.</p> <p>As you'll  see, the main actor for many of the things that happened inside of  cells and in living organisms are proteins. And we'll be talking about  what those are and their structures in some detail at the next thing.  But the information is not coded in the proteins. The information for  coding everything that's in a cell is in units called genes which are  made of, as you probably all know, DNA.</p> <p>So there have been,  classically there were two approaches towards studying biology in  detailed ways. One was the approach of the biochemist who basically took  whatever it was, put it in a whirling blender or something, and ripped  everything into little pieces. Sort of like taking the alarm clock and  shaking it so hard all you've got is all the little bits. And once you  got it into all little bits then you can purify a little thing like a  spring or a little wheel or something and try then to figure out what  that does in the context of the cell.</p> <p>You can get very detailed  information. And this is in a sort of trivial way the science of,  discipline of biochemistry. Geneticists take a different sort of  approach. And what they do is they take the living organism and look for  a variant where there has just been one single change in that whole  organism and they study its properties. And what you learn from that is  physiologically relevant information.</p> <p>And if you broke up a car  and purified the ashtray you could postulate that that was really  important for the car. But if you made a mutant that was missing the  ashtray and it still ran, you know, you'd learn that that wasn't what  was correct. And one of the really powerful things that people could  only do in very rare instances for a long time was to unite the kinds of  observations that biochemists made with the kinds of observations  geneticists made.</p> <p>And the explosion in knowledge that's happened  over the last couple of decades, probably, well, since probably 1975  when recombinant DNA came in, was a whole new realm of sort of a general  discipline we call molecular biology that allowed us to clone genes, to  sequence them, to many of the things we'll be talking about. But one of  the real powers in looking at this sort of way of thinking about how we  study biology is that it suddenly enabled one to put these two sorts of  things together.</p> <p>If you were a biochemist and you purified a  protein and you found out a chemical property that it had and you  wondered what it did in the cell, you could sequence the protein and  deduce what some of the DNA sequence was, find the gene, disable the  gene in the organism, look and see if your idea was right. Or vice  versa, if you were a geneticist and you found a mutant that had an  interesting property and you wondered how it was working then you could  clone the gene, look at the protein and try and figure it out.</p> <p>And  that's partly way since about 1975 there has just been this absolute  upheaval in our knowledge of biology. And we'll be talking about all of  these disciplines here as we go through the course. Three or four of you  were honest enough to say I'd rather be anywhere on earth but in this  class. I'm a senior. I really didn't want to be here. And I said to you  the other day if you'll come I'll give you the best I have to try and  show you why I think it's exciting and why it's so relevant to you and  your life as you go looking forward to moving on with your careers and  your family and everything else.</p> <p>However, even if you're not  interested in this course, don't get caught in the trap because we're  not going to be doing differential equations that it's easy. Part of the  reason biology is hard is each one of these disciplines has a different  kind of thinking. And to be very effective in biology right now you  have to be able to think like a chemist, how bonds are formed and broken  and what's reasonable.</p> <p>You need to be able to think in  3-dimensional structures because everything happens in 3-D and biology  is very much about fitting shapes together. Genetics is more like  probability and statistics. Some of those logic games that you sort of  used to try and do. It's more like that. PCR is, I don't know,  recombinant DNA, all this sort of stuff is sort of a strategy kind of  game.</p> <p>So you'll find, as you go through this course, that there  maybe some things that are easy and some that are difficult. But for  you, easier or difficult, you'll need to do a lot of different thinking.  And then, at the moment, you cannot do biology anymore by just being a  biochemist or just being a geneticist. You could in the old days, but  now you've got to do it all.</p> <p>So where we're going to start right  now will be with biochemistry. And just before I do that I just want to  show you -- Let's see. I wonder if we're going to be able to see these  slides with that light on. I think we'll see if we can do this. So the  green fluorescent protein, thanks, that's great. The green fluorescent  protein, which we showed you the other day, is a protein. And we're  going to be talking about that.</p> <p>And you'll see it's got  structures. You've got these sorts of sheets and you'll see little  helices. And in a couple of days you'll know what this is all about. But  I wanted to tell you a couple of things just before I get into this.  This actually was, I showed you that little Barney thing to try to  emphasize that if you looked at evolution that way, you can see most of  it was at the level of single cells, and that's why things are so common  when you get down to the cellular and molecular level.</p> <p>I've  actually done that demo one other place, and that was after, I'm an  American Cancer Society research professor, and they asked me to give a  talk for the 50th anniversary of the Illinois Division of the American  Cancer Society on the importance of basic research. And it was after  dinner, 500 people in tuxedos and evening gowns and bottles of wine, and  they kept shortening my time.</p> <p>And finally I had ten minutes to  get up there in my tux and tell them about the importance of research,  basic research. And I finally decided maybe what I could do is help them  understand why when they gave money to cure cancer biologists went, ah,  signed this one off, and studied all these other organisms, fruit flies  and everything. So I did this little demo.</p> <p>So I was up on the  stage at the Sheraton holding the Barney and the dinosaur doing what you  saw me do here. And I thought of briefly about putting my tux on just  to kind of, you know, give a little zip to the extra lecture, but  decided not to because I'd get chalk all over it or something. So if you  think I look stupid doing this, you know, my cats thought I was  absolutely an idiot afterwards.</p> <p>They looked very, very puzzled as  to what was going on. OK. So I'm going to start talking in a couple of  minutes about covalent bonds, and you're going to roll your eyes upwards  and think I've heard about that since I was a baby, or some of you will  think that. But I just want to keep, you've got to understand something  about how the parts that are used in biology are built or it won't make  sense. And so just to sort of give you something to sort of keep you  going here, I want to sort of foreshadow a couple of things that are  coming.</p> <p>Here's an example of what happens with genetics. This is a  single mutation in one gene of an individual. This woman has what's  known as Werner syndrome. That's what she looked like as a teenager.  That's what she looked like at age 48. That's one of these mutations  that causes advanced aging. And people are working very hard on what  that, you know, trying to understand aging.</p> <p>During your time at  MIT, there are going to be some, there already have been some amazing  discoveries in the last five years, and it's going to be a time of  explosive growth. But that's just one change. And it offers a huge clue  as to why we age. Here's another example. These are people who have a  human condition called Xeroderma Pigmentosum. And this was the way they  used to look before we understood it. They have a deficiency in handling  damage to their DNA that's caused by sunlight.</p> <p>So if they went  out in the sunlight once they'd get skin cancer. You can see they get  skin lesions and everything else. It was due to a defect in just one  gene. And it took out an important kind of DNA repair. Now they know how  it works. The kids who do this only go out at night. They go to summer  camp at night. They call them "Children of the Moon".</p> <p>They look  normal and they don't get skin cancer, but they have to live a kind of  special life because of this problem. And people are working on fixing  that. That's the sort of thing that can come out genetics. Single  change, absolutely dramatic affect. You can sort of make inferences that  something important is broken in that individual because the rest of us  don't have this problem.</p> <p>The biochemists, you know Watson and  Crick, and we'll talk more about their structure of DNA. But DNA has to  get replicated. In fact, just in the last couple years we now know  that's what's wrong with this person is that they're lacking a special  DNA copying machine that is able to copy over strands of DNA that have  damage in them that's caused by sunlight. It's got a very sort of  flexible active site.</p> <p>It can accommodate the bulkiness of this UV  induced lesion. And so here's a case where we've now united our  understanding of that disease at the ultimate biochemical molecular  level and the high level human syndrome. So that's kind of one thing to  sort of keep you going. OK. So here's a cell. That's the fundamental  unit of life. I said the other day remember cells carry out metabolism.</p> <p>They  do regulated growth. They do reproduction. That's what makes them  different from just a bag of proteins and nucleic acids and things. And  we could think about cells at a couple of different levels. We could  think about them in terms of their atomic composition. I guess we can.  Let's see. And if we think about it that way it's not particularly  exciting. Hydrogen is about 60%, oxygen is about 20%, carbon is about  12%, nitrogen is about 5%, and then there's a whole lot of other stuff  present at lower levels, phosphorus, sulfate, magnesium, manganese,  selenium, etc.</p> <p>This isn't a particularly helpful way to think  about cells. This is perhaps a more useful way, and that's to think  about it in terms of molecular composition. And we're about 80% water.  Virtually all living organisms, more or less the same, 80% water is what  our cells are made up of. And of the rest of them, there are four major  classes of macromolecule, large biological molecules that make up the  rest of cells.</p> <p>And that's what we're going to be focusing on in a  little bit. There are proteins, which I've already mentioned today, and  that's about 50% of it. Nucleic acids, that's DNA and RNA, we'll say  that's about 15%. Carbohydrates, which we'll be talking about today.  Lipids about 10%. And there is a bunch of little stuff that is important  but makes up the remaining amount.</p> <p>But to understand biology  we're really going to have to try and figure out how cells work. We're  going to need to talk about the properties of those molecules. And just  so you'll know, this picture is actually, this was made by somebody at  Lawrence Berkeley National Labs. As far as I know she still hasn't  published it. This is an image of an actual cell.</p> <p>It's made by a  very fancy technique called x-ray tomography where she sort of takes a  zillion little sort of slices and then assembles the whole thing. This  is a yeast cell. That purple thing, artificially colored, is the  nucleus. This thing in the middle is a big storage thing called a  vacuole in the cell. We cannot see the other cellular components right  now, but that is a real cell. It looks like a textbook, but it's  actually a yeast cell that got its picture taken by this very fancy  thing.</p> <p>So, as I say, we're going to charge right now into starting  to think about these various molecular forces that make possible, that  give these various biomolecules or biomacromolecules their properties.  And I just want to give you sort of a game plan for how we're going to  do this over the next couple of lessons, couple of classes. They're sort  of classes of chemical forces.</p> <p>And today we'll be talking about  covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds. And we'll go onto to talk about other  ones in the next class or two. And then we're going to talk about these  biological macromolecules that I just listed. Proteins. Actually, the  order we'll be talking about them, carbohydrates, nucleic acids,  proteins and lipids. So the way I'm going to do this is I can tell you  about the properties of carbohydrates by just talking about covalent  bonds and hydrogen bonds.</p> <p>And once we've discussed those we'll go  on here and I'll give you a couple of examples. And once we've learned  some more we'll go on and I'll give you some other examples. And, as I  said, in a second I'm going to say covalent bonds. It's going to seem  boring. Here's just something to sort of keep in, we'll get another one  in a minute, to look ahead, why do we want to do this sort of stuff? I  showed you this picture the other day.</p> <p>These are E. coli swimming  along. Those things I told you are those sort of long spiral things are  bundles of protein filaments called flagella. They're being rotated by a  motor at the end of the bacterium that's rotating ten to a hundred  thousand RPM. And that thing is moving at such a rate, so many body  lengths a second that if it was me moving at that speed I'd be going 300  miles per hour that many body lengths.</p> <p>So these are bacteria  swimming around. The motor that drives them is made of proteins. And  this is a textbook representation of that motor. It has familiar parts  to some of you. Here's a rotator. There's a bushing. There's a drive  shaft and so on. It's got parts that you would recognize as an engineer,  but it's all made out of proteins. And that's a textbook diagram. What I  want to show you in the next slide is they've taken a whole lot of  electron micrographic images of those things, and the resolution isn't  so good, but they averaged a whole bunch of them.</p> <p>And this is what  it looks like. So you can sort of see this really is a machine. It's  built of proteins. And to understand how these machines work you have to  understand some of these forces. So that's why I'm going to start in  and we're going to begin with covalent bonds so that we're all on the  same page right from the beginning. And another aspect, as you'll see,  even though you may have heard about some of these bonds before, there's  a new issue that's going to need to occupy your attention.</p> <p>And  that is, what's the strength of the bond in the context of temperatures  and conditions that are relevant to life? If you can break a bond at  1000 degrees it doesn't matter because you cannot have life at that  temperature. You've got to be thinking about a much more restricted  temperature sort of range. So covalent bonds, as most of you know, this  is the principle force that holds atoms together. It involves a sharing  of the electrons.</p> <p>And an example you can all do in your sleep, I'm  sure. If we take four hydrogen atoms and a carbon atom we can come up  with this molecule which has four covalent bonds. This is methane.  That's the molecule that the cow we saw the other day burps 400 liters  of. Those are the little bubbles you see coming up when you walk around  the edge of a lake. And it's usually those pairs of electrons, as you  know, that are usually represented like this.</p> <p>The typical length  is about 0.15 to 0.2 nanometers. And the important thing about these  bonds is these are strong. It takes about 83 kilocalories per mole to  break a carbon-carbon bond. So at physiologically relevant temperatures  they don't break. They can rotate, they can stretch and they can bend,  but they're not going to break. And so if you have a carbon-carbon bond  in a biological organism it will be doing this.</p> <p>The carbons will  be going this way. They'll be bending back and forth this way but they  won't be breaking. And to just give you a sense of how far away they are  from breaking, the energy of, say, one of these vibrational modes is  about 0.6 kilocalories per mole so that you have -- The average bond is  so far away from breaking, even though it's a distribution, and some are  more than others that our molecules stay together, which is good  because we wouldn't want our DNA flying apart because the covalent bonds  were breaking under physiological conditions.</p> <p>But that also leads  us to the need for one of the things that we'll have to talk about,  which is one of the great secrets of life, is that the metabolism, all  stages of life involve the making and the breaking of bonds. And you  cannot just add a platinum catalyst and put it at 500 degrees centigrade  under a thousand atmospheres of pressure. All the chemistry that  happens in life has to take place in aqueous solution pretty close to pH  7 at about, you know, 25, 37 degree centigrade.</p> <p>There are a few  organisms that can do it out, but most of it is somewhere around body  temperature. Room temperate is where all that has to take place. So what  you can see is that there had to be some, in order for life to occur  there had to be some invention that would let bonds be broken and be  formed under physiologically relevant conditions. And those are enzymes.  I know most of you have heard of those.</p> <p>We'll talk about them in a  maybe more sublevel, beyond what some of you have heard anyway. But  that -- Keep in mind now that's the driving force for why we need  enzymes, because covalent bonds are so strong. I also remind you that  there are different types of covalent bonds. That's a single bond. This  would be a double bond or a triple bond. And they get stronger as you  share more electrons.</p> <p>It gets harder and harder to break them.  These are double and triple bonds called unsaturated bonds. When we talk  about unsaturated fats and things that's because they have double bonds  in them. So olive oil has double bonds in it and beef fat, for example,  doesn't. Other molecules that have double bonds that are important are  oxygen and nitrogen gas, which has got a triple bond.</p> <p>And when  Penny talks to you about the nitrogen cycle this is one of the really  important ones thinking about ecology because we all use nitrogen, but  most organisms including ourselves and most things on earth cannot break  that bond. Yet we all need nitrogen. It has be what they called fixed,  so it's joined to something like ammonia or nitrite or something like  that.</p> <p>And that little fluorescently labeled bacteria I showed you  invading a plant, we'll see it again, is able to form a symbiosis of  plant. It's one of the few creatures on earth that knows how to break  that bond. And that's why you can get plants that can grow, like peas  and beans and alfalfa and things that can grow without nitrogen  fertilizer. Because they have a little bacterium who knows how to break  that bond and they figured out how to get together and collaborate in a  symbiosis.</p> <p>So these bonds are very important. So there's another  characteristic of these bonds which is going to be very important for  thinking about biology. And it's known as chirality. And it comes from  the fact that our life on this planet is based on carbon, and carbon's  ability to form remarkable kinds of bonds. And, as you see over there,  carbon forms four bonds. But right now we have to start thinking in  3-dimensional space because carbon is a tetrahedron.</p> <p>Carbon, four  single bonds. And they're in a tetrahedral arrangement. So if I label  them like this, this means it's coming out of the board, I'm sorry. A,  B, C. And that means it's going back into the board. So if I do a mirror  image, if I looked at what this would look like, if I could look at its  reflection in a mirror, I would see it would look like this. So these  are what are known as optical isomers.</p> <p>And depending on how you  are at thinking in 3-dimensions this may be obvious to you or it may not  be obvious to you, but you cannot superimpose those. And this is  critical because all through biology there are carbons that have four  different substituents that join to them. And every time that occurs,  biology chooses one of those arrangements, not the other.</p> <p>And we  have sort of a macro way of perhaps communicating this. So you've been  at the party at the dorm. I was housemaster in McCormick for six years a  while back so I've lived at least in that environment. It's early  February, you're having to go back across the Mass Ave bridge, it's  minus 20 and the wind is whipping along and your hands are freezing. And  you reach into your pocket to get your gloves and uh-oh, two left  gloves.</p> <p>Right there you have the problem. Biology, as a theme  you'll hear over and over again, is about fitting shapes. And your hands  are mirror images of each other. And you could think of your gloves as  being sort of a receptor. And if the receptor is designed to take your  right hand, take your left hand, I guess, let's say, you cannot get your  right hand into the glove. It just doesn't fit.</p> <p>And it's at a  molecular level. It's exactly that same thing. So we're going to have to  worry as we go through this about not only how many bonds there are,  but this is why the exact molecular shape, including this optical isomer  issue is going to be very important. There's another very important  principle of covalent bonds that has, again, a huge impact on biology.  And that concerns how the atoms involved in the forming that covalent  bond think about sharing electrons.</p> <p>In some cases the sharing is  pretty much equal, as in a carbon-carbon bond. That would make sense  since it's the same thing on both sides. Or a carbon-hydrogen bond. The  sharing of electrons is pretty much the same, so the electrons on  average are distributed in between them. And this is what's known as a  nonpolar bond. However, there are important cases of unequal sharing.  And the characteristic of an atom or an element that determines how this  sharing goes is known as electronegativity.</p> <p>And you could think  of this as sort of a euphemism for the greediness of an atom for  electrons. So if you have an oxygen-hydrogen bond, oxygen is more  electronegative than hydrogen. What that means is that although the  electrons are still shared, this is not an ion or anything, the  electrons are shared, there's going to be a little bit of a negative  charge on the oxygen and a little bit of a positive charge on the  hydrogen.</p> <p>And that means you, you know, this will have all sorts  of consequences, as you'll see in a minute. And there's one important  molecule, which if we did the molecular composition you can see there's a  lot of it around, and that's water. And it's got two OH bonds. And  here's where the structure of water is important, that these two bonds  are not 180 degrees opposite to each other.</p> <p>They're 104.5 degrees.  So you end up with a little negative charge here, a little positive  charge here, a little positive charge there. And so every single water  molecules sort of have a negative side and more or less a positive kind  of side. And this has consequences because this means that the water  molecules are going to interact. And to understand that part I need to  introduce you to this second force which we know as the hydrogen bond.</p> <p>And  this is the -- This is a bond that takes place, that arises because of  the slight positive charge of an H bonded to oxygen or nitrogen -- --  and the slight negative charge -- -- of the oxygen or the nitrogen  itself. And right in water we see this is an issue, because if we have  water like this with a couple little bit of positive charges here and  there and a little negative charge here, and there's another water  molecule over here, a little positive charge, a little negative, a  little positive, we can get here what's known as a hydrogen bond.</p> <p>The  hydrogen bond is about one-twentieth the strength -- -- of a covalent  bond. And that number is really important, because what that means is  that at temperatures that are relevant for life, not all the molecules  will have enough energy to break, in a population will have enough  energy to break that bond. But some of them will. So hydrogen bonds, let  me just write that down, so at physiologically relevant temperatures  some molecules -- -- have the energy to break a hydrogen bond.</p> <p>And  we'll talk about it next time. But probably many of you know that DNA  is made of two strands. And the whole principle of copying the genetic  information is you can pull the strands apart and copy the complimentary  information. And we'll spend a lot of time talking about that. But the  relevant thing for the moment is those two strands, each of which are  joined by covalent bonds, are held together by a whole series of  hydrogen bonds between the different base pairs.</p> <p>And so right  there sort of is the root of why the cells are able to pull those apart,  put them together. And so these hydrogen bonds are really, really  important. And because our life on this planet is based, we're  water-based, and the reason water is such a good solvent is that it is  able to form these hydrogen bonds. So this is just a little movie  showing the hydrogen bonds, a little simulation of how they can move  around and rotate.</p> <p>The green thing would be the hydrogen bonds  here. This is not really a full representation because the water  molecules are constantly changing partners so they form little cages and  little shells, but they keep forming hydrogen bonds. They'll break one  with one water molecule and immediately reform with another. This is a  simulation that someone did. It's a picosecond of what would happen to  water molecules at zero degrees centigrade where they're liquid.</p> <p>So,  at this point, they haven't frozen but they're just above that. And you  can sort of get the sense how they're changing partners here. Here's  another simulation done at 100 degrees centigrade. So this would be a  boiling temperature. And what you can see now is every now and then one  of the molecules gets enough energy to break free of these cages.</p> <p>And  that, when you're watching something boil in a kettle, that, at a  molecular level, is what's happening, is one or another molecule is  finally getting enough energy to break free of this sort of chains of  hydrogen bonds that are formed. And it's when we go to think about how  things interact in water, when you dissolve sugar in water or something  in water, you try and dissolve butter in water, when you stick something  into water you have to break a whole lot of bonds.</p> <p>So there's an  energy cost to just simply putting something into water. And what makes  things dissolve or not is whether once they're in there they can form  bonds back again because water is carbon and hydrogen bonds. There is no  polarity. To get it to dissolve you'd have to break hydrogen bonds.  That costs energy. And it cannot form any because it's only got nonpolar  bonds in the butter so the butter floats around on the water.</p> <p>But  this is really a very, very important force. And, in fact, you know,  this is why when some of the really interesting properties of water come  from. You all know about surface tension. You've watched little bugs  skate around on the surface of the water. This is the lizard that lives  in the rainforest of Central and South America, and it's about two and a  half feet long.</p> <p>And it can take advantage of this surface tension  that's due to the hydrogen bonding of water to go scooting right across  the water. This is not the greatest of videos. It's what I've managed  to find so far, but you get the idea. It actually runs across the water.  And you're watching the hydrogen bonding in action here. When I was a  grad student my work thesis was on the synthesis of ribonucleotides,  little pieces of RNA.</p> <p>And I went in a thesis competition. And at  the end, where you're supposed to give a talk about your thesis, and  there were four of us, I thought, well, at least I have a fighting  chance. And when I got in there it turned out one of the other people  who was competing was a guy who studied this lizard, so his talk was  full of movies of these lizards running back and forth across ponds of  water.</p> <p>And I thought I'm dead meat. But it actually turned out I  won it, so I was very surprised. But every time I see something like  this it reminds me of it. OK. And just to remind you, too, I mean you  may not have been thinking of it in this way, but of course what was all  that fuss about when they sent the expeditions to mars? They were  looking for traces of water. And why is that so important? It's because  water has this amazing capacity to form hydrogen bonds and be the  solvent that can let life go.</p> <p>The moon on triton has methane. All  nonpolar bonds, they're talking about raining methane and rivers of  liquid methane and stuff. You might think about whether it is possible  to design a life form or not or at least what ways things would have to  be different. OK. And we've done enough that I can quickly now introduce  you to our first class of molecules which are carbohydrates.</p> <p>Julia,  would you mind flipping that light back on for a minute? OK. So  carbohydrates have the general property, general formula. They're CH20.  And you can have different numbers of them. N-1 carbons have a COH bond.  That's known as a hydroxyl group. And one carbon has a double bond  oxygen which is either known as an aldehyde if it's at the end of a  chain or as a ketone if it's in the middle.</p> <p>And these things can  come in different numbers. So if N equals three it's a triose. If N  equals five it's a pentose. The sugars that you'll see in DNA and RNA  are pentoses. They're five carbon units. A six carbon unit is a hexose.  And a very common hexose that you're all familiar with, at least  familiar with the name of is glucose. And the structure of glucose in a  linear form, if I draw it out here, it's got the double bond at one end,  so it's an aldehyde in that case.</p> <p>And then there's an OH this  way, OH this way, OH, let's see. One, two, three, four, five, six. OH.  And it's just going off the bottom of the end here, bottom of the board  for some of you probably. But we have hydrogens in the other places.  Now, what I had to do in order to put up this depiction was kind of  flatten this molecule, which you'll know every one of these is a  tetrahedral arrangement.</p> <p>And flatten it down so I could write it  on the board. So there are actually four chiral centers in a glucose  molecule. And, furthermore, although this is a representation that you  can find in textbooks and I can write it on the board that's not how it  appears in nature. What happens is that the oxygen here comes up and  actually cyclizes to this carbon.</p> <p>And this hydrogen goes and sits  up here. And it gives you, the way glucose is actually found in  solution, this would be what's known as beta-glucose. And the reason I'm  saying beta is we've got a new chiral center that's formed by this  cyclization. And just to give you a sense of where we are, this is one,  two, three, four, five, six going this way. And over here it's one, two,  three, four, five and six that way. And you can sit there and work this  out yourself afterwards.</p> <p>This is known as a pyranose ring because  it's got, it's actually a six-member ring, but you can see one of the  oxygens is now part of the ring and the extra carbon is sticking out  here. And in solution, because of this new chiral center, we've now got  the possibility of this thing joining so that the OH is up or the OH is  down. And when it's up, the OH is up, that's known as the beta form.</p> <p>And  if the OH is down, that's known as the alpha form. So, again, we've got  to keep our eyes on all these chiral centers. This kind of depiction,  again, is sort of hard to draw. So, again, people tend to sort of  flatten it out. And you'll see this kind of representation. You have to  realize that this is approximately the 3-dimensional shape.</p> <p>This  is a representation. Here's beta-glucose there. Every time that you  change the position of one of these hydroxyls, we end up with another  sugar. So this is beta-galactose, sugar with very different properties.  And the difference is here the hydroxyl is up, here the hydroxyl is  down. Two different sugars, two different properties, but as simple a  difference as that. And then a thing that happens in nature is you can  join different sugar molecules together by a principle that you'll see  over and over again.</p> <p>And that you'll split out a molecule of water  and you get a new covalent bond where this oxygen joins over to the  carbon over here. And what that gives you is galactose beta-1,4 glucose.  This beta-1, 4 glucose is a molecule that you know as lactose or milk  sugar. And part of the reason we know about it is because in order to  metabolize that you need to have a special enzyme that cuts right here.  That enzyme is known as beta-galactosidase.</p> <p>That's an enzyme. It's  a protein, which we'll be talking about in the coming lectures, and  it's able to cause this bond to break. And what happens when you become  lactose intolerant is you lose the beta-galactosidase that we all have  as a baby, because we need to be able to eat milk. And if you don't have  it then the lactose passes through your stomach without getting  metabolized.</p> <p>It gets into your intestine and there are those ten  to the fourth bacteria. They metabolize it, break that bond, and then  that causes the gas and discomfort that's associated with lactose  intolerance. So all the textbooks use lactose as the, beta-galactosidase  as the common enzyme. So the first time I thought that I'd teach this  course I thought, boy, I have a really good idea.</p> <p>I'm going to  come up with a sample enzyme that's different, but I have to learn what  it was. And it was inspired by there's this product called Beano which  is supposed to reduce the side effects that are commonly associated with  eating beans, which probably many of you are familiar with from summer  camps and things. And the technical term is flatulence. But, in any  case, this was supposed to be something that reduced flatulence.</p> <p>So  I thought it's got to be an enzyme. I know it had something to do with  all of the saccharide s that will change the sugar. So I looked at the  little thing of Beano, and it said Hotline, any questions call. So I  phoned up and said, hi, this is kind of an unusual question. I'm a  college professor and I'm going to be teaching an introductory biology  course.</p> <p>And I was wondering if I could find out what enzyme you  had in Beano and what it did to what was in the beans. And I said, you  know, it's really sort of an odd question but, you know, maybe I could  talk to one of the scientists in the lab. And a woman says, hello,  Beano. And she listens to me. And she says, yes, we have a special  package we send out to college professors. And the next thing I knew I  got this huge flood of stuff.</p> <p>So I am now able to quickly tell you  why beans are the musical fruit. And the basis of it is if you join a  glucose and a fructose together by an alpha-1, 2 linkage you get  sucrose. And you all know that's table sugar. We can eat sucrose no  problem. But what beans have is beans have a galactose alpha-1, 6  linkage to sucrose. Or they actually, sometimes they have two galactose  alpha-1, 6 linkages to sucrose and we cannot metabolize them.</p> <p>And  that's sort of related to the same idea as the lactose intolerance that  they go through a stomach, and then the bacteria know how to break that  bond and that causes the problems that you encountered at summer camp.  And so what Beano turned out to be is it's a sort of low-tech biotech  product. It's a food-grade mold called neurospora. And it's a very, very  crude preparation of an alpha-1, 6 galactosidase.</p> <p>In other words,  an enzyme that can break that molecule. And once it breaks it you have  sucrose, which we can eat, and galactose, which we know what to do with.  And that's the basis of that. So the very last thing is to talk about  polysaccharides. These come when you join together multiple sugars. And,  as you can appreciate by now, there are many, many ways of joining  sugars together.</p> <p>But suppose we take N glucoses. There are two  common ways they can get joined. They can get joined together by  alpha-1, 4 bonds. And these give a helical confirmation. And you know  these as starch or glycogen. These are energy storage molecules. And  I've run marathons, some of you may have, but at least you probably know  about carbo-loading. What you're trying to do before you go is you're  eating pasta and everything, which is full of starches, so it's got  polymerized sugars.</p> <p>And you're trying to get your body to take  these in and polymerize them into glycogen so your liver is as loaded  with glycogen before you start the race. And hitting the wall in a  marathon is when you run out of glycogen. And then you start burning  fatty acids and it's no fun at all. But that's what carbo-loading is all  about, is manipulating glucoses that are in an alpha-1, 4 confirmation,  if you just make a beta-1, 4 confirmation.</p> <p>So the only difference  that's happening in the way we join glucoses together is whether the  hydroxyl is up or down when you join the two of them together. You get  something that's a linear molecule that forms hydrogen bonds between the  sugars. So you have a linear chain of sugars. And I'm not going to show  the details of the hydrogen bond, but you have one chain going this way  and another chain of sugars here.</p> <p>And you can get hydrogen bonds  between them. And you know this as cellulose. So there are two very  important biomolecules that are made up of glucose. That's just some  glucose there. And if you join them by alpha-1, 4 linkages you get  starch, corn starch, which you've all encountered. If you join them by  hydroxyl in the other direction you get cellulose. Cellulose is  important in biology.</p> <p>It's what plants make their cell walls of.  That's why you can have trees that are so enormously high. And I guess  I'll close with one last. So most of the paper we get from cellulose is  from trees. If you've ever tried to make beer or wine or something, you  probably know you've got to keep fruit flies away or you're going to get  vinegar. And the reason you get vinegar is that the fruit flies carry  on their feet a bacterium called acidobacteria.</p> <p>And it likes to  live at the surface between the water and the air. And what it does  then, in order to do that is it makes cellulose, and it floats itself  right at the, it makes this great thick mat of cellulose. And it floats  itself right at the air surface interface. And you can get a mat that's  half an inch thick of absolutely perfect cellulose. And so you don't  ever want to see that if you're trying to make beer or wine or  something.</p> <p>But it's a bacterium that's making this molecule. So you find it in other places besides trees. So, OK, we'll see you on Monday.</p>
