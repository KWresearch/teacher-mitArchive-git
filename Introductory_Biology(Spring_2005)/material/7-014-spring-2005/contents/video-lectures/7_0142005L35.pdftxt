Transcript â€“ Lecture 35 

OK, so  finishing up predation. We ran out of time last time. We talked about 
predation, and let me give you the big overarching context here. We've been ta lking 
about interactions between organisms. We talked about competition between 
organisms and how this shapes community structure and drives evolution. And then 
we moved onto predation, the interaction where one of the organism's fitness is 
increased and the other one's fitness has decreased. And that this, too, shapes 
community structure, and in many different ways. 

One way we talked about was keystone predators and how when you remove a 
predator from the system it can completely change the competitive  interactions of 
the organisms in that ecosystem. That was the starfish example. And we also started 
talking about predation as an evolutionary agent, as a selective force. And I started 
show ing you just some p ictures. Some of the best evidence for that is what we see in 
the characteristics of prey populations. So just very quickly going back here. The 
evolution of defense mechanisms like these sp ines on the cactus that wards of 
predation, spines on a porcup ine that ward of predation. Here's another defense 
mechanism of an octopus, when d isturbed puts out that big ink cloud. And here are 
some caterpillars that look very much like snakes that are more threatening to a 
predator than a caterpillar but they are still caterpillars. 

An alarm. Many snakes have coloration on their tails to attract the predator to their 
tail rather than their head if they're going to be attacked. And this is one of my 
favorite bugs. This is  its tail versus its head. And then we ta lked about a larm, you 
like that one? So do I. I don't know why. It's so silly. And then we ta lked about eyes 
or things that look like eyes, that we assume are a lso what attract a predator to the 
wings here rather than the head. And then this system, which can develop into 
having these eyes or not, depend ing on the substrate. So here we are. 

This is some form of caterpillar. This is what's called cryptic coloration. In other 
words, it b lends into  the leaf of the plant that it  lives on. And if it develops during 
this time of year it looks like a leaf. If it develops during the time of year when the 
plant is making these catkins, these flowers, it actually looks like the reproductive 
part of the plant. So it has developmenta l mechanisms, a developmenta l sw itch in 
the same species that can make it look one way or another, depending on what the 
plant looks like that it is living on. And, again, as we ta lk about these I hope you will 
constantly remember all of the molecular biology that you  learned  from Professor 
Walker. Now that's a very good question. 

The question was does it actua lly change the phenotype while it's developing or do 
both phenotypes develop and one gets selected out depending on what the 
background is? And I don't know the answer but that's an excellent question. And I 
will see if I can find out the answer, but a very good question. And it would be 
interesting either way. Well, I think it would be more interesting if it actually 
changed the development, because figuring out what the cues were at the molecular 
level would be interesting. Here's one, a leafhopper that resembles the leaf that it 

lived on. A cryptic coloration. . This is an insect  looking very much like the leaf that 
lives there. I think we'll see one of those in the clip. 

Here is another. This is a praying matis. There is his head. There are his legs sitting 
in with the flower peda l. Butterflies. Here's a slug on a leaf. Here's a flounder 
blending into the sand on the bottom. And there's another one which you can barely 
see. There are his eyes. And in this way avoiding predators. And the amaz ing thing 
about these flounders is they can change their color very rapid ly. And they can 
match the substrate. And this one is trying to look like checkerboard which it would 
never encounter in nature, but you can see these checkerboard patterns on it. So 
how they do this, you know, the actual mechanisms for this are probably not that 
well understood. But  it's pretty convincing. Here is a  toad b lending into its substrate. 

Another toad. Look, you can barely see it on this rock. Some more insects that are 
looking like spines on a leaf. And here's a moth that looks very much like a tw ig that 
it's on. And then there are these alarms. This guy is trying to say, you know, don't 
come near me. I look b igger than I rea lly am by putting out these. And then there 
are frogs that use a d ifferent strategy that draw attention to themselves, but they 
have a good reason to do  that because they have a poison. So they're saying to the 
predator, you know, move onto some other frog because if you attack me I'm going 
to taste bad. And then there are chemical defenses. This is a bombardier beetle 
being p inched by somebody's forceps here. And  it's spraying this very nasty 
substance on the predator. 

And you can see  it can d irect  it in any direction. And there is a wonderful story about 
this beetle that was stud ied extensively by scientists at Cornell University. There's a 
whole field ca lled Chemical Ecology where peop le actually study the chemistry. This 
would be a great MIT prob lem because there's a rea lly interesting chemica l reaction 
in the system here that creates this exp losive force. They put two things together 
and create this force here. 

And this is a very acid ic solution. And these scientists were out in the field in the 
middle of the desert studying these guys. And they needed an acid to develop some 
chromatography reaction so they had the beetles spray on it. And they made the 
beetle a co-author on the paper and it got by the ed itors. That's an interesting story. 
So there's a paper out there with the beetle's Latin name as a co-author on the 
paper. 

Just a little story. And here's another beetle that doesn't have that defense, but it 
mimics the posture. So a predator comes up, and this gets into this whole area of 
mimicry that we're going to ta lk about, where there are a lot of systems where you 
have a defense mechanism and then another organism evolves to mimic that 
defense even though it doesn't have the real thing. So this beetle just assumes the 
posture and some of the predators think, oh, I better avoid that one. 

Fireflies have a particular flash that attracts. The fema les have a flash that attracts 
the mates of their particular species. Some of them have learned to mimic the flash 
of other species. And when the ma le is drawn into that flash they actua lly eat them. 
Another evolutionary function of the predatory force. And then there are many 
examples of this mimicry. These are two butterflies of d ifferent species. One of which 
is toxic or very unpalatable to prey species. And the other is not unpa latab le but 
because it looks like that one is less likely to be preyed upon. 

And people have done experiments to test hypotheses about these and shown how 
that works. And there are lots of also  fly species that have evolved to look like these 
species for the same reason. So there are several of these mimetic systems. So 
we're going to move on them to mutua lism. So we've talked about minus-minus 
interactions, competition, minus-p lus interactions, which was predation, and 
mutualism is p lus-plus, win-win. Both organisms benefit from being in contact with 
the other organisms. And severa l of the clips I'm going to show you have to do with 
mutualism. So I'm going to go through this rather quickly. And these examp les, for 
the most part, are from your book. 

I'm show ing this examp le because it also has an experiment that goes w ith  it in your 
book. These are treehoppers, like insects that suck on the sugar solutions from the 
tree. And they squirt out the sugar for the ants that they're symbiotic with. They 
feed the ants because the ants, in turn, protect them from sp ider predators. And 
there are many systems like this. 

And I show you this one because they d id experiments. And you can do them easily. 
Here's a study plot. These are the plants that have the ants on them. And these are 
plants. You can remove the p lants and then measure whether the plants have an 
effect on treehopper surviva l. And so this  is the average number of young 
treehoppers per plant w ith the ants, without the ants. So w ith the ants there are 
more. 

And they a lso showed in this study, though, that if you, in years where the predators 
of the treehoppers, the sp iders were less abundant, the symbiosis loosens up. 
There's no point in feeding the ants if you don't need them to protect you. So these 
are dynamic systems. So treehopper survivorship increased by the present of ants. 
Another system just  like this is where ants  live in these thorns in acacia p lants. 
These are hollowed out thorns that provide a habitat for the ants, but when the plant 
is vulnerab le to herb ivore grazers the ants all come out in  force and scare off the 
herbivore. This is my absolute favorite, one of my favorite biological systems of all 
times. And we're going to show a clip of this. 

These are tree cutter ants that go out and get p ieces of leafs and bring them back to 
the nest, chew them up, and they farm this fungus on the leaf chewate or whatever 
you want to call them. They pulverize the leaf. And they actua lly farm a fungus. And 
then they eat the fungus. That's their food. So there's this mutualistic interaction 
between the ants and the fungus. And there's even a really interesting complexity 
here that you'll see in the clip where the ants actually also carry a bacterium on their 
chest that makes an antib iotic that keeps the fungus farm free of infection by other 
fung i that might take it over. So it's this beautiful, beautiful co-evolutionary system 
that predates human beings many, many, many millions and millions of years of 
agriculture. 

I mean the ants are litera lly farming and of natural antibiotic. So I'll stop ta lking so 
we can get to the clip. Another examp le of mutualism that is one of my favorites are 
cleaner fish. In coral reef ecosystems there are cleaning stations where these little 
cleaner fish, here is one, which hang out in these g iant fish. And turtles and other 
organisms in the ecosystem come to these stations, and these cleaner fish p ick of 
little ectoparasites from these giant fish. So  the fish get cleaned and these guys get 
fed. There's a moray eel being cleaned by one of these fish. I mean that could wipe 
that guy out in two seconds if it wanted to make a meal out of it, but it's not worth it 
to get a mea l because it's better to get parasite-free. 

However, whenever you have mutualism you also have cheaters. And so this is an 
example of, and I love this p icture because it kind of has the cheater smiling, you 
see? And this is a fish that has evolved to look just  like this cleaner fish. But it's not 
a cleaner. 

And it comes into these cleaning stations, and it dashes in and just takes a chunk out 
of the skin of one of these fish because they're off guard, you know, they're not on 
guard for fish that look like this. And you can get into beautiful, beautiful population 
analyses and game theory analyses of these systems, because the presence of these 
cheaters actually strengthens the mutua listic bond between the cleaner fish and the 
host. Because if the fish that's being cleaned is more fit, the better it can recognize, 
tell the difference between these two, right? And the better it is at recogniz ing the 
real cleaner fish the more fit it's going to be, and that tightens that relationship. 

So it's a rea lly interesting dance. And you can do game theory ana lyses. OK, more 
mutualisms. These are all from your text. Those are my cats cleaning each other. I 
thought you should meet my cats. They clean each other and then they fight. OK, so 
enough from me. Let me show you some clips, if I can make this thing work right. 
OK, so  the first one, well, I'll just start p laying it. 

So your cha llenge is to figure out what these are about.
