1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:05
So today we are going to continue
where we left off last time talking

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:11
more specifically about variations
on the theme of life.

3
00:00:11 --> 00:00:16
And last year I tried to do this
lecture using PowerPoint and it was

4
00:00:16 --> 00:00:22
a total disaster so I'm going back
to the board.  You will have the

5
00:00:22 --> 00:00:28
PowerPoint slides.
They'll be on the Web to download

6
00:00:28 --> 00:00:34
to summarize basically what I'm
drawing on the board.

7
00:00:34 --> 00:00:42
But it will be slightly different on
the board.  But I found that for

8
00:00:42 --> 00:00:50
this material it really doesn't work
to exclusively use the PowerPoint.

9
00:00:50 --> 00:00:58
So last time we talked about,
remember, my life on earth

10
00:00:58 --> 00:01:07
abridged where --

11
00:01:07 --> 00:01:16
-- we had photosynthesis making
glucose or organic carbon plus

12
00:01:16 --> 00:01:25
oxygen?  And then the reverse of
this was respiration.

13
00:01:25 --> 00:01:32
And then we had elements cycling in

14
00:01:32 --> 00:01:38
the middle.  And I said this is very,
very abbreviated of how all life on

15
00:01:38 --> 00:01:44
earth works.  And so today what I'm
going to do is tell you that that's

16
00:01:44 --> 00:01:50
not right.  That's grossly
oversimplified.

17
00:01:50 --> 00:01:56
And there are some really
interesting variations on the theme

18
00:01:56 --> 00:02:02
of how to extract energy and carbon
and reducing power and electrons

19
00:02:02 --> 00:02:08
from the earth's system
to create life.

20
00:02:08 --> 00:02:13
And it's mostly microbes that have
these diverse possibilities.

21
00:02:13 --> 00:02:18
And, again, even what I'm going to
talk to you about today is

22
00:02:18 --> 00:02:23
oversimplified.
If you go to a microbiology

23
00:02:23 --> 00:02:28
textbook you'll find just about
every possible combination of energy

24
00:02:28 --> 00:02:33
sources, carbon sources and electron
sources in some microorganisms

25
00:02:33 --> 00:02:39
somewhere to get through life.
So I'm giving you,

26
00:02:39 --> 00:02:45
again, the simplified version
because otherwise it gets way too

27
00:02:45 --> 00:02:51
complicated.  So all of life needs
carbon and energy,

28
00:02:51 --> 00:02:57
and a lot of other elements,
too, but these are the main axis

29
00:02:57 --> 00:03:03
upon which we're going to order our
universe today.

30
00:03:03 --> 00:03:13
So for carbon the choices are
inorganic or organic.

31
00:03:13 --> 00:03:23
So this would be CO2 and this might
be glucose or sugars,

32
00:03:23 --> 00:03:33
any sugars.  And then on the energy
axis they can use solar energy,

33
00:03:33 --> 00:03:43
as in photosynthesis, or they can
use chemical energy.

34
00:03:43 --> 00:03:54
And within the chemical energy
sources they can be inorganic or

35
00:03:54 --> 00:04:05
organic like sugars, etc.
And often here you have reduced

36
00:04:05 --> 00:04:16
compounds such as hydrogen sulfide,
ammonia, and we'll talk about these.

37
00:04:16 --> 00:04:27
So these are the ways we divide up
the possibilities for carbon and

38
00:04:27 --> 00:04:36
energy sources to be alive.
All organisms also need to have an

39
00:04:36 --> 00:04:42
energy currency in the cell.
And you've talked about this a lot

40
00:04:42 --> 00:04:48
already in the biochemistry lectures
so I'm, again,

41
00:04:48 --> 00:04:54
just giving you the impressionist
view of this.  You know the details.

42
00:04:54 --> 00:05:00
This is just to get you organized.
And so all life uses

43
00:05:00 --> 00:05:06
redox reactions.
And in your handouts for today

44
00:05:06 --> 00:05:14
there's a primer on redox reactions
just in case you want to review that.

45
00:05:14 --> 00:05:22
And one of the key reactions we'll
talk about today is the conversion

46
00:05:22 --> 00:05:30
of NADP.  If you put energy in you
can reduce it to NADPH.

47
00:05:30 --> 00:05:37
So that's a reduction.
And the reverse you get energy out

48
00:05:37 --> 00:05:45
when it's oxidized.
Now, we're going to be talking

49
00:05:45 --> 00:05:53
about oxidation and reduction today.
And then they all use ATP which

50
00:05:53 --> 00:06:01
you've talked a lot about here.
And the couple here is ADP.  Put

51
00:06:01 --> 00:06:10
energy in.

52
00:06:10 --> 00:06:16
You make ATP which is a high energy
intermediate.  And in converting it

53
00:06:16 --> 00:06:23
back to ADP that energy can be
released.  And this is used in the

54
00:06:23 --> 00:06:30
biochemistry of the cell.
So all cells have these two energy

55
00:06:30 --> 00:06:37
conversion processes in common.
OK, so let's look at just

56
00:06:37 --> 00:06:44
summarizing what we're going to go
over today.  This is a summary of

57
00:06:44 --> 00:06:51
options for life.
See also Freeman,

58
00:06:51 --> 00:06:58
Chapter 25.  There is some
discussion of this.

59
00:06:58 --> 00:07:03
And we can divide life here between
what we call autotrophs.

60
00:07:03 --> 00:07:08
These are organisms that can make
their own organic carbon.

61
00:07:08 --> 00:07:13
In other words, they can convert
carbon dioxide to organic carbon.

62
00:07:13 --> 00:07:19
Heterotrophs are organisms that can
only use organic carbon.

63
00:07:19 --> 00:07:24
They rely on the guts of other
organisms in order to

64
00:07:24 --> 00:07:29
get through life.
And so now we're going to

65
00:07:29 --> 00:07:35
systematically go through these
processes that fall under each one

66
00:07:35 --> 00:07:40
of these.  Oxygenic photosynthesis
is the one we've been talking about

67
00:07:40 --> 00:07:45
last time and in my abbreviated
version of life on earth.

68
00:07:45 --> 00:07:51
And this is carried out by
eukaryotic organisms,

69
00:07:51 --> 00:07:56
plants, trees, etc., and also by
prokaryotic organisms.

70
00:07:56 --> 00:08:02
Those are the cyanobacteria,
microscopic photosynthetic plants.

71
00:08:02 --> 00:08:06
They use CO2 and sunlight.
So our first variant on this theme

72
00:08:06 --> 00:08:10
we'll get into is a group of
bacteria that do anoxygenic

73
00:08:10 --> 00:08:15
photosynthesis.
Oxygenic means they evolve oxygen.

74
00:08:15 --> 00:08:19
These guys use solar energy but
they don't evolve oxygen.

75
00:08:19 --> 00:08:24
And we'll get into how that works.
And then there's a group of

76
00:08:24 --> 00:08:28
organisms that still use CO2.
And in the very similar pathway the

77
00:08:28 --> 00:08:34
Calvin Cycle is photosynthesis.
But they use chemical energy in

78
00:08:34 --> 00:08:42
order to make these intermediates to
fix CO2.  OK, so let's talk about

79
00:08:42 --> 00:08:50
those first.  And so we're going to
talk about the autotrophs.

80
00:08:50 --> 00:09:01
And all of them share this

81
00:09:01 --> 00:09:11
pathway, CO2 to C6H12.
This would be glucose.

82
00:09:11 --> 00:09:21
And it takes ATP to run this
reaction and it also takes

83
00:09:21 --> 00:09:34
reduced NADPH --

84
00:09:34 --> 00:09:40
-- to run this reaction.
It also takes this enzyme ribisco

85
00:09:40 --> 00:09:47
which you've talked about I'm sure,
ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase.

86
00:09:47 --> 00:09:53
And this is the enzyme that
initially takes the CO2 from the

87
00:09:53 --> 00:10:00
atmosphere and binds it
to an organic carbon.

88
00:10:00 --> 00:10:04
Now, in a detailed version of this
is what's called the Calvin Cycle or

89
00:10:04 --> 00:10:08
the Calvin/Benson Cycle.
I don't know which one your book

90
00:10:08 --> 00:10:13
calls it.  Calvin got the Nobel
Prize but Benson was the graduate

91
00:10:13 --> 00:10:17
student that did all the work,
so you should recognize that.

92
00:10:17 --> 00:10:22
Anyway, you studied this in great
deal.  But an interesting factoid is

93
00:10:22 --> 00:10:26
that ribisco is the most abundant
protein on earth.

94
00:10:26 --> 00:10:30
That tells you how important this
reaction is for sustaining

95
00:10:30 --> 00:10:36
life on earth.
So notice that in order to drive

96
00:10:36 --> 00:10:43
this reaction,
which is the Calvin Cycle,

97
00:10:43 --> 00:10:50
it requires energy and reducing
power.  So where do they get it?

98
00:10:50 --> 00:11:14
Well, there are three ways that

99
00:11:14 --> 00:11:20
autotrophs can get energy and
reducing power to drive this

100
00:11:20 --> 00:11:27
reaction.  And the first is oxygenic
photosynthesis.  And the

101
00:11:27 --> 00:11:34
second is anoxygenic.
And the third is chemosynthesis.

102
00:11:34 --> 00:11:41
OK, those first three there.  So
now we're going to go through each

103
00:11:41 --> 00:11:49
of these and look at how they work
remembering that all of them are

104
00:11:49 --> 00:11:56
generating ATP and NADPH in order to
drive that.  So all of the

105
00:11:56 --> 00:12:02
autotrophs have that in common.
Well, oxygenic photosynthesis is the

106
00:12:02 --> 00:12:06
one that you know well already.
You've studied it in great detail

107
00:12:06 --> 00:12:11
in biochemistry.
So we're going to,

108
00:12:11 --> 00:12:15
again, give you the abbreviated
version here just so you have a

109
00:12:15 --> 00:12:20
template to map these
other ones onto.

110
00:12:20 --> 00:12:38
These are what are known as the

111
00:12:38 --> 00:12:45
light reactions of photosynthesis,
the Z scheme taking solar energy,

112
00:12:45 --> 00:12:51
splitting water,
evolving oxygen and synthesizing ATP

113
00:12:51 --> 00:12:58
and NADPH.  This is all familiar,
right?  Very familiar.  I'm just

114
00:12:58 --> 00:13:06
writing it in a cartoon version.
OK, so this is the NADPH and ADP

115
00:13:06 --> 00:13:17
that goes to fuel that process.

116
00:13:17 --> 00:13:22
OK, so now, well,
at least I can do it on that board.

117
00:13:22 --> 00:13:28
Let me do it on this board.
Anoxygenic --

118
00:13:28 --> 00:13:39
-- is almost exactly like this

119
00:13:39 --> 00:13:47
process, but instead of splitting
water these guys oxidize hydrogen

120
00:13:47 --> 00:13:55
sulfide.  So here's
our ATP and NADPH.

121
00:13:55 --> 00:14:03
And they use sunlight to do this.

122
00:14:03 --> 00:14:09
So these are called photosynthetic
bacteria.  And they were around very

123
00:14:09 --> 00:14:15
early on the earth.
Long before the earth's atmosphere

124
00:14:15 --> 00:14:21
was oxygenated these were the guys
that were able to use solar energy

125
00:14:21 --> 00:14:27
and make organic carbon but without
evolving oxygen.

126
00:14:27 --> 00:14:32
Then somewhere along the line some
cell evolved, had some mutations and

127
00:14:32 --> 00:14:37
somehow figured out that water,
this abundant source of water was a

128
00:14:37 --> 00:14:43
much better electron donor than
hydrogen sulfide.

129
00:14:43 --> 00:14:48
And once the biochemistry figured
this out, you can see the simple

130
00:14:48 --> 00:14:54
substitution here,
the whole earth started going in a

131
00:14:54 --> 00:14:59
different direction.
So this is an interesting example

132
00:14:59 --> 00:15:05
of how a small biochemical
innovation can dramatically change

133
00:15:05 --> 00:15:10
the whole nature of the planet.
Now, these guys are still around on

134
00:15:10 --> 00:15:14
earth.  In fact,
I'm going to show you some.

135
00:15:14 --> 00:15:19
I'll explain this at the end,
but I have some captured in here.

136
00:15:19 --> 00:15:24
See that little purple band?  Those
are those guys.

137
00:15:24 --> 00:15:29
I've got other little tricks in
here but I'll save those.

138
00:15:29 --> 00:15:34
Well, you cannot really see the
purple band.  But you can come up

139
00:15:34 --> 00:15:39
later and look at it.
Those are photosynthetic bacteria.

140
00:15:39 --> 00:15:44
So they're still around on the
earth but they're stuck in places

141
00:15:44 --> 00:15:49
where there's no oxygen.
So they have a rather restricted

142
00:15:49 --> 00:15:54
niche on the planet now,
but they're still extremely

143
00:15:54 --> 00:15:59
important.  What did I
do?  Oh, here it is.

144
00:15:59 --> 00:16:03
So one of the places that they can
be found, and if you're interested

145
00:16:03 --> 00:16:08
in them a great place to go find
some is out at the Mystic Lakes in

146
00:16:08 --> 00:16:13
Arlington which is a permanently
stratified lake so the bottom of the

147
00:16:13 --> 00:16:18
lake is always anaerobic.
There's never oxygen there.

148
00:16:18 --> 00:16:23
In a typical lake like that you
have a lot of mud on the bottom and

149
00:16:23 --> 00:16:28
you have a lot of hydrogen sulfide
coming out of the mud from bacterial

150
00:16:28 --> 00:16:34
processes that we'll talk about.
And you have light here.

151
00:16:34 --> 00:16:41
And so you have a gradient here of
this is oxygen and this is H2S.

152
00:16:41 --> 00:16:49
And these photosynthetic bacteria
have to life somewhere where there's

153
00:16:49 --> 00:16:56
enough light to photosynthesize and
enough hydrogen sulfide to use in

154
00:16:56 --> 00:17:02
this part of the reaction.
But they're very sensitive to oxygen

155
00:17:02 --> 00:17:06
so they cannot be in the oxygenated
part of the lake.

156
00:17:06 --> 00:17:11
So you find them in a layer.
It's called the squeeze.  They have

157
00:17:11 --> 00:17:16
to have light so they have to be up,
but they cannot have oxygen so they

158
00:17:16 --> 00:17:20
have to be down.
And they need hydrogen sulfide so

159
00:17:20 --> 00:17:25
they have to be down.
So they're layered in lakes.

160
00:17:25 --> 00:17:30
OK.  So what about these guys,
chemosynthesis?

161
00:17:30 --> 00:17:36
They don't rely on solar energy.
Again, they're still driving the

162
00:17:36 --> 00:17:42
Calvin Cycle reducing CO2 from the
air into organic carbon,

163
00:17:42 --> 00:17:48
but they're not using sunlight.
So what do they do?  They get their

164
00:17:48 --> 00:18:02
energy --

165
00:18:02 --> 00:18:16
-- from redox reactions.
And let's just show you an example.

166
00:18:16 --> 00:18:27
Redox reactions couple to the

167
00:18:27 --> 00:18:37
conversion of oxygen to H2O.
So oxygen is involved in these

168
00:18:37 --> 00:18:47
reactions.  And one organism,
for example, can take ammonia and

169
00:18:47 --> 00:18:57
convert it to nitrite.
Another type of organism can take

170
00:18:57 --> 00:19:07
nitrite and convert it to nitrate.
And there are other organisms that

171
00:19:07 --> 00:19:17
can take hydrogen sulfide and
convert it to sulfate.

172
00:19:17 --> 00:19:27
And some can take hydrogen sulfide,
oh, no, take iron, ferrous iron,

173
00:19:27 --> 00:19:35
Fe2+ and convert it to Fe3+.
So in all of these cases what is

174
00:19:35 --> 00:19:42
happening to these compounds?
Are they being oxidized or reduced?

175
00:19:42 --> 00:19:49
I heard an oxidized.  Yes, they're
being oxidized.

176
00:19:49 --> 00:19:56
So these reduced compounds,
relatively reduced compounds can be

177
00:19:56 --> 00:20:03
utilized by oxidizing them.
The organism can release the energy

178
00:20:03 --> 00:20:10
that's needed.  ATP
is generated here.

179
00:20:10 --> 00:20:25
And NADPH is generated by any of

180
00:20:25 --> 00:20:31
these redox couples.
So using this energy then the cell

181
00:20:31 --> 00:20:39
takes the reduced NADPH and the ATP
and it runs the Calvin Cycle,

182
00:20:39 --> 00:20:46
chemosynthesis.  OK.  Now, you may
think that these are kind of strange,

183
00:20:46 --> 00:20:54
weird bacteria that life in strange
pockets of the earth where there's

184
00:20:54 --> 00:21:00
no oxygen.  And who cares anyway?
They're outdated.

185
00:21:00 --> 00:21:04
They dominated the earth way back
in the early stages of the earth but

186
00:21:04 --> 00:21:09
they're not so important now.
Well, that's not true.  They're

187
00:21:09 --> 00:21:14
incredibly important.
In some ecosystems they're the

188
00:21:14 --> 00:21:18
total base of the entire ecosystem.
But also on a global scale, as

189
00:21:18 --> 00:21:23
you'll learn, you should have a
feeling for this by the end of this

190
00:21:23 --> 00:21:28
lecture, but also when we talk about
global biogeochemical cycles you

191
00:21:28 --> 00:21:32
will learn that these microbes are
really messengers for electrons in

192
00:21:32 --> 00:21:37
the environment.
Without them the redox balance of

193
00:21:37 --> 00:21:41
the earth would not be maintained,
OK?  You cannot have nothing but

194
00:21:41 --> 00:21:46
oxidizing reactions or nothing but
reduction reactions and have a

195
00:21:46 --> 00:21:50
system sustain itself.
So it's these microbes that are

196
00:21:50 --> 00:21:54
playing a really important role in
maintaining the redox balance

197
00:21:54 --> 00:21:59
of the earth.  OK.
Now, one system that I'm going to

198
00:21:59 --> 00:22:04
show you in that DVD,
that will do much better justice to

199
00:22:04 --> 00:22:09
it than my drawings here,
that's a deep-sea volcano in case

200
00:22:09 --> 00:22:15
you didn't recognize it.
And this is 2500 meters at the

201
00:22:15 --> 00:22:20
bottom of the ocean,
very, very deep.  And there is

202
00:22:20 --> 00:22:25
intense heat.  I mean just think of
a volcano on the surface

203
00:22:25 --> 00:22:31
of the earth.
Intense heat and reduced compounds

204
00:22:31 --> 00:22:37
are found in the earth's mantle that
are ready to erupt through this

205
00:22:37 --> 00:22:44
deep-sea volcano.
And you have sulfate in the sea

206
00:22:44 --> 00:22:50
water that percolates through here.
And as it percolates in and gets

207
00:22:50 --> 00:22:57
draw into the volcanic stuff that's
coming out of here it's reduced to

208
00:22:57 --> 00:23:04
hydrogen sulfide coming
out of the volcano.

209
00:23:04 --> 00:23:08
But you have oxygen in the water in
the deep-sea. And we'll be talking

210
00:23:08 --> 00:23:12
about this when we talk about ocean
circulation.  But the oceans have a

211
00:23:12 --> 00:23:16
global ocean circulation where the
surface water that's in equilibrium

212
00:23:16 --> 00:23:21
with the atmosphere actually sinks
and travels along the bottom of the

213
00:23:21 --> 00:23:25
ocean.  So there is oxygen in the
bottom of the ocean,

214
00:23:25 --> 00:23:30
unlike many lakes where you don't
have oxygen.

215
00:23:30 --> 00:23:37
And we'll talk about that difference.
And in the hot vents the water

216
00:23:37 --> 00:23:44
coming out of here can be very,
very hot, but there's a gradient

217
00:23:44 --> 00:23:51
right as it comes out meeting the
colder sea water.

218
00:23:51 --> 00:23:58
And so what you have here is a
perfect incubator for chemosynthetic

219
00:23:58 --> 00:24:07
bacteria --

220
00:24:07 --> 00:24:12
-- that use the hydrogen sulfide in
chemosynthesis to fix carbon dioxide

221
00:24:12 --> 00:24:18
using the oxygen here.
And that forms the base of the

222
00:24:18 --> 00:24:23
entire food web in the deep ocean
because there's no light down there.

223
00:24:23 --> 00:24:29
There's no photosynthesis.  There's
only chemosynthesis.

224
00:24:29 --> 00:24:35
And just a little story that goes
back to when I first came to MIT as

225
00:24:35 --> 00:24:41
an assistant professor in 1976.
You weren't even born.  But when I

226
00:24:41 --> 00:24:47
was young we used to go the Muddy
Charles Pub periodically after work

227
00:24:47 --> 00:24:53
and have beers.
And there was a professor,

228
00:24:53 --> 00:24:59
in this department actually,
John Edmond, who passed away several

229
00:24:59 --> 00:25:05
years ago but who used to be there.
It was sort of like our Cheers.

230
00:25:05 --> 00:25:11
And I'll never forget the day he
came back from a cruise.

231
00:25:11 --> 00:25:17
He came to the pub.  He was a
chemist and I'm a biologist.

232
00:25:17 --> 00:25:23
And he said you will not believe
what we found on the bottom of the

233
00:25:23 --> 00:25:29
ocean.  He had gone down in Alvin,
this two-person submersible vehicle.

234
00:25:29 --> 00:25:33
And he started talking about these
giant clams and these giant tube

235
00:25:33 --> 00:25:38
worms and all of these things,
and I thought he had had one too

236
00:25:38 --> 00:25:43
many beers.  I found it hard to
believe.  Well,

237
00:25:43 --> 00:25:48
it turned out that that was the
first discovery of these deep-sea

238
00:25:48 --> 00:25:53
vents and he was on that expedition.
And through that collegial

239
00:25:53 --> 00:25:58
relationship I actually ended up
with one of the clam shells from the

240
00:25:58 --> 00:26:03
clams there, which is one
of the giant clams.

241
00:26:03 --> 00:26:08
Their meat is blood red because they
have a special kind of hemoglobin

242
00:26:08 --> 00:26:13
that they use to keep the oxygen
tension perfect for these

243
00:26:13 --> 00:26:18
chemosynthetic bacteria.
If the oxygen is too high they

244
00:26:18 --> 00:26:23
cannot do this because it will
spontaneously oxidize the H2S.

245
00:26:23 --> 00:26:29
So the oxygen tension is very
critical.

246
00:26:29 --> 00:26:32
And they have a special kind of
hemoglobin that does that.

247
00:26:32 --> 00:26:36
So these claims had symbiotic
chemosynthetic bacteria.

248
00:26:36 --> 00:26:40
Well, since then these vents have
been discovered everywhere and

249
00:26:40 --> 00:26:44
ecosystems similar have been
discovered on the surface.

250
00:26:44 --> 00:26:48
And there are all kinds of
different vents.

251
00:26:48 --> 00:26:52
You're going to learn about not
only hydrothermal vents,

252
00:26:52 --> 00:26:56
hot vents in this video, but also
cold seeps they're called where you

253
00:26:56 --> 00:27:00
have methane bacteria that are
really important.  OK.

254
00:27:00 --> 00:27:05
So these are the main ways in which
organisms can get energy to convert

255
00:27:05 --> 00:27:11
CO2 to organic carbon.
Then you have all these

256
00:27:11 --> 00:27:17
heterotrophs, the ones that use the
organic carbon,

257
00:27:17 --> 00:27:23
and they have various ways of doing
that.  You've learned in

258
00:27:23 --> 00:27:29
biochemistry the primary way,
which is very powerful, and that is

259
00:27:29 --> 00:27:35
using aerobic respiration
to do that.

260
00:27:35 --> 00:27:44
And so we are just going to
abbreviate that here.

261
00:27:44 --> 00:27:54
That's our reverse of
photosynthesis.  So heterotrophs.

262
00:27:54 --> 00:28:03
So we have first aerobic.

263
00:28:03 --> 00:28:13
And let me jump ahead

264
00:28:13 --> 00:28:25
with the slides.

265
00:28:25 --> 00:28:32
OK, there you are.
So this is a cartoon version of

266
00:28:32 --> 00:28:40
aerobic respiration.
So we'll just put glucose,

267
00:28:40 --> 00:28:47
we'll come down to the Krebs' Cycle.
And we are going to let electrons

268
00:28:47 --> 00:28:55
flow here and have oxygen be the
final electron acceptor

269
00:28:55 --> 00:29:02
creating water.
So we've really just accomplished

270
00:29:02 --> 00:29:09
the absolute reverse of
photosynthesis and we've made NADH

271
00:29:09 --> 00:29:16
in doing this and we've made ATP.
So these guys are getting the

272
00:29:16 --> 00:29:22
energy out of the glucose that all
of the other organisms made.

273
00:29:22 --> 00:29:29
And oxygen is the terminal electron
acceptor when there's

274
00:29:29 --> 00:29:35
oxygen around.
But there are lots of environments,

275
00:29:35 --> 00:29:41
as we've talked about on earth,
where there isn't oxygen.

276
00:29:41 --> 00:29:46
And there are bacteria that can
take advantage of those environments.

277
00:29:46 --> 00:29:52
And instead of having oxygen be the
terminal electron acceptor there are

278
00:29:52 --> 00:29:57
a number of other elements that they
can use, compounds that they can use.

279
00:29:57 --> 00:30:03
For example, there are some that
use nitrate and they reduce

280
00:30:03 --> 00:30:10
it to nitrous oxide.
N2.  Ammonia.  All the relatively

281
00:30:10 --> 00:30:19
reduced forms of nitrogen.
And so this called anaerobic.

282
00:30:19 --> 00:30:29
And this process is called

283
00:30:29 --> 00:30:36
gentrification.
And if it weren't for these bacteria,

284
00:30:36 --> 00:30:40
these anaerobic bacteria that can
reduce nitrate,

285
00:30:40 --> 00:30:44
nitrogen would never return to the
atmosphere.  Remember last time we

286
00:30:44 --> 00:30:48
talked about nitrogen fixation,
how specific types of microbes can

287
00:30:48 --> 00:30:52
take N2 from the atmosphere and pull
it into the ecosystem?

288
00:30:52 --> 00:30:56
Well, if you didn't have these
bacteria doing this process that

289
00:30:56 --> 00:31:00
nitrogen would never get
back to the atmosphere.

290
00:31:00 --> 00:31:04
They're central to closing the
nitrogen cycle.

291
00:31:04 --> 00:31:08
Then there are some that can use
sulfate and reduce it to hydrogen

292
00:31:08 --> 00:31:13
sulfide.  As you can imagine,
these are critical to creating the

293
00:31:13 --> 00:31:17
hydrogen sulfide that's used in
these other processes.

294
00:31:17 --> 00:31:22
There are some that use CO2 and
convert to methane.

295
00:31:22 --> 00:31:26
These are methanogenic bacteria,
and they're incredibly important in

296
00:31:26 --> 00:31:31
the global carbon cycle and
in the methane cycle.

297
00:31:31 --> 00:31:36
Methane is a really powerful
greenhouse gas,

298
00:31:36 --> 00:31:42
and we're going to talk about that
later.  And then there are some that

299
00:31:42 --> 00:31:48
can take Fe3+ and reduce it to Fe2+.
And the same for manganese.

300
00:31:48 --> 00:31:55
So you should be starting to sense a

301
00:31:55 --> 00:32:00
sort of symmetry here,
right, that these anaerobic bacteria

302
00:32:00 --> 00:32:05
are fulfilling functions on the
earth.  Let me write these down.

303
00:32:05 --> 00:32:17
These are sulfate reducers,
these are methanogens, and these are

304
00:32:17 --> 00:32:30
iron reducers and manganese
reducers.

305
00:32:30 --> 00:32:37
So these will all become extremely
important when we talk about the

306
00:32:37 --> 00:32:44
global biogeochemical cycles of all
of these elements.

307
00:32:44 --> 00:32:51
It's these microbes that make sure
that the cycles can continue and

308
00:32:51 --> 00:32:58
don't run into a dead end of
oxidation or reduction.

309
00:32:58 --> 00:33:05
OK.  Before we go to the movie,
I just want to say if you look at

310
00:33:05 --> 00:33:12
Table 25.2 in your textbook,
I think it's that one.

311
00:33:12 --> 00:33:18
I'm assuming I'm using the most
recent version.

312
00:33:18 --> 00:33:24
You'll see a variation of this
theme in which there will be some

313
00:33:24 --> 00:33:30
entries of organisms that don't fall
into these categories that

314
00:33:30 --> 00:33:36
I've just shown you.
And that is to say that there are

315
00:33:36 --> 00:33:41
organisms that use light energy and
organic carbon energy at the same

316
00:33:41 --> 00:33:46
time.  For every variation that's
possible there's an organism that's

317
00:33:46 --> 00:33:51
evolved to take advantage of it.
I've just oversimplified it here,

318
00:33:51 --> 00:33:56
but you should know that.  And the
bottom line is if it's

319
00:33:56 --> 00:34:01
thermodynamically possible.
And, again, this whole lecture could

320
00:34:01 --> 00:34:06
have been done in a thermodynamic
mode.  We could have looked at which

321
00:34:06 --> 00:34:12
redox couples were energetically
possible and then assigned those to

322
00:34:12 --> 00:34:17
particular microbes.
But for now I just want you to get

323
00:34:17 --> 00:34:22
the overview.  But for anything
that's thermodynamically feasible

324
00:34:22 --> 00:34:28
there's a microbe out there
that's doing it.

325
00:34:28 --> 00:34:32
And, in fact, microbiologists
actually comb through redox tables

326
00:34:32 --> 00:34:37
and put together different redox
couples and hypothesize.

327
00:34:37 --> 00:34:41
I ought to be able to find an
organism that does this in that

328
00:34:41 --> 00:34:46
environment.  And then they go out.
And they can almost always actually

329
00:34:46 --> 00:34:50
find it.  So they're incredibly
versatile.  And it gives you a

330
00:34:50 --> 00:34:55
really good strong feeling for the
power of thermodynamics in driving

331
00:34:55 --> 00:35:00
the evolution of these biochemical
processes.

332
00:35:00 --> 00:35:07
Finally, before we show you the
movie I want to show you what this

333
00:35:07 --> 00:35:15
thing is all about.
There was a Russian microbiologist

334
00:35:15 --> 00:35:23
back in the previous century
named Winogradsky --

335
00:35:23 --> 00:35:33
-- who wanted to isolate some of

336
00:35:33 --> 00:35:39
these photosynthetic bacteria.
And knowing what their

337
00:35:39 --> 00:35:45
characteristics were he went out and
got himself some mud and some pond

338
00:35:45 --> 00:35:52
water.  And he set up what we've
come to call a Winogradsky column.

339
00:35:52 --> 00:35:58
This is a Winogradsky juice bottle,
but it works the same.  And what you

340
00:35:58 --> 00:36:05
do is you put mud in the bottom and
you put pond water here.

341
00:36:05 --> 00:36:09
And the pond water has basically an
inoculum.  It has representatives of

342
00:36:09 --> 00:36:13
all different types of bacteria.
They might be spores.  If they

343
00:36:13 --> 00:36:17
don't like the environment they're
in they sporulates and then they

344
00:36:17 --> 00:36:21
just don't germinate.
But presumably in pond water you

345
00:36:21 --> 00:36:25
have everything that could possibly
grow in here.  And in the mud you

346
00:36:25 --> 00:36:29
add a source of sulfate.
And so you might add calcium

347
00:36:29 --> 00:36:33
sulfate and you might add a little
organic matter,

348
00:36:33 --> 00:36:38
you know, plant parts or something
just to jumpstart it.

349
00:36:38 --> 00:36:45
And eventually you set up a gradient
here of hydrogen sulfide and oxygen.

350
00:36:45 --> 00:36:53
And over time the organisms grow
along that gradient.

351
00:36:53 --> 00:37:01
So you'll end up down here with the
anaerobic respiration.

352
00:37:01 --> 00:37:08
In fact, the organisms generate this

353
00:37:08 --> 00:37:12
gradient.  When you start out the
whole thing is oxygenated.

354
00:37:12 --> 00:37:16
And what you should think about in
this context is what happens.

355
00:37:16 --> 00:37:20
How do these gradients get
generated when you start out with a

356
00:37:20 --> 00:37:24
completely mixed system,
everything in there, everything

357
00:37:24 --> 00:37:29
oxygenated?  Eventually
you have anaerobic --

358
00:37:29 --> 00:37:33
First you'll just have anaerobic
respiration, right?

359
00:37:33 --> 00:37:38
Anything that can use organic
carbon and oxygen is going to go

360
00:37:38 --> 00:37:42
like mad, and that's what's going to
draw the oxygen down.

361
00:37:42 --> 00:37:47
Then you'll have anaerobic
respiration here.

362
00:37:47 --> 00:37:51
You'll have photosynthesis up here,
evolving oxygen.  You'll have

363
00:37:51 --> 00:37:56
chemosynthetic bacteria here because
they need a little bit of oxygen but

364
00:37:56 --> 00:38:00
they also need some of this hydrogen
sulfide and photosynthetic

365
00:38:00 --> 00:38:07
bacteria here.

366
00:38:07 --> 00:38:11
Well, they're like down here.
Because they need light but cannot

367
00:38:11 --> 00:38:16
have oxygen.  And so you can set
these up.  And this purple band here

368
00:38:16 --> 00:38:19
tells you that you've got your
photosynthetic bacteria.
