1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
So today we're going to continue our
focus on DNA which I'm personally

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:09
enthusiastic about at least in terms
of being such a fascinating molecule.

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:14
And I told you the story last time
of how we actually came to

4
00:00:14 --> 00:00:19
understand that DNA was the genetic
material.  And I still see comments

5
00:00:19 --> 00:00:24
that, oh, God,
all this stuff is not relevant to

6
00:00:24 --> 00:00:29
the exam.  We're trying to construct
the exams in ways that test whether

7
00:00:29 --> 00:00:34
you got the concepts and not just
whether you memorized every term

8
00:00:34 --> 00:00:39
that you ran into in the textbook.
So I'm hoping that you will see some

9
00:00:39 --> 00:00:43
greater purpose in why I'm trying to
talk about some of this.

10
00:00:43 --> 00:00:47
And also I'm sure some of you will
forget the details of transformation,

11
00:00:47 --> 00:00:51
of DNA replication we're going to go
into as we sort of burrow into it

12
00:00:51 --> 00:00:55
over the next lecture or so,
but what I am hoping you may

13
00:00:55 --> 00:00:59
remember ten years from now,
even those who don't go in biology,

14
00:00:59 --> 00:01:04
is how experiments are done, how
real people do them.

15
00:01:04 --> 00:01:07
And that was partly what I was
trying to tell you.

16
00:01:07 --> 00:01:11
And you guys are pretty good at
figuring out the basic principle

17
00:01:11 --> 00:01:14
that someone had to somehow show
that a DNA molecule in one organism

18
00:01:14 --> 00:01:18
could change some organism to have a
new characteristic.

19
00:01:18 --> 00:01:21
And as I sort of told you with the
work from Frederick Griffith.

20
00:01:21 --> 00:01:25
And then his initial stuff wasn't
devoted to that at all.

21
00:01:25 --> 00:01:28
It was trying to solve a very
pressing problem which is dealing

22
00:01:28 --> 00:01:32
with pneumonia in a pre-antibiotic
era.

23
00:01:32 --> 00:01:36
And then the finding that he got,
that this odd result that something

24
00:01:36 --> 00:01:41
in a heat-killed extract could be
transferred to a live bacterium sort

25
00:01:41 --> 00:01:45
of set things up for Avery and his
colleagues after a number of years

26
00:01:45 --> 00:01:50
of work to make a very powerful
argument that DNA was the genetic

27
00:01:50 --> 00:01:54
material.  But,
as I said at the end of last lecture,

28
00:01:54 --> 00:01:59
that paper was published
in the 1940s.

29
00:01:59 --> 00:02:04
And people didn't immediately say oh,
wow, DNA is the genetic material.

30
00:02:04 --> 00:02:09
Often, and we'll see it again with
genetics, there's sometimes sort of

31
00:02:09 --> 00:02:15
the body of science the average
person thinks about.

32
00:02:15 --> 00:02:20
Science needs to reach to a certain
state before an idea can take hold,

33
00:02:20 --> 00:02:26
even if there's evidence supporting
it.  Part of the problem was that

34
00:02:26 --> 00:02:31
chemists had isolated DNA.
And the way they used to isolate DNA

35
00:02:31 --> 00:02:35
was really rough on it.
Crack the cells open.  And what

36
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
happened, it would all get broken
down into little pieces of DNA.

37
00:02:39 --> 00:02:43
And people had worked out the basic
chemical structure that it was the

38
00:02:43 --> 00:02:47
deoxyribose and how the things were
joined together,

39
00:02:47 --> 00:02:51
but nobody had ever seen anything
more than just these little pieces

40
00:02:51 --> 00:02:55
of DNA.  And there was a widely held
conception that it was just an

41
00:02:55 --> 00:03:00
anonymous tetranucleotide
of G, A, T and C.

42
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04
It wasn't clear why the cells made
it, but it didn't look like anything

43
00:03:04 --> 00:03:08
that could encode information.
Whereas, as I said, something like

44
00:03:08 --> 00:03:12
proteins, those seem to be very
different.  And so the world wasn't

45
00:03:12 --> 00:03:16
quite ready for it.
Another thing, and this came from

46
00:03:16 --> 00:03:20
one of the comments here,
was someone said they didn't know

47
00:03:20 --> 00:03:24
bacteria could take up DNA from the
environment.  And,

48
00:03:24 --> 00:03:28
in fact, most bacteria can.
It happens that streptacoccucci and

49
00:03:28 --> 00:03:32
some other bacteria at certain
phases in their lifetime develop

50
00:03:32 --> 00:03:36
this capacity to take up
DNA from the outside.

51
00:03:36 --> 00:03:39
Given what I've told you about a
membrane and how hard it is to get

52
00:03:39 --> 00:03:43
things across it,
you could imagine it's not trivial

53
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
to get a DNA molecule which is huge
from one side to the other.

54
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
So it doesn't normally happen.
And what happens if you go into a

55
00:03:50 --> 00:03:53
lab and you're cloning something or
other, and we'll talk about how to

56
00:03:53 --> 00:03:57
take a couple pieces of DNA and join
them together in a test tube and

57
00:03:57 --> 00:04:01
then put them back
into a bacterium.

58
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
If we put it into E.
coli that doesn't normally take up

59
00:04:04 --> 00:04:08
DNA you'll find that it's sort of
basically black magic.

60
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
You cook them up with some divalent
cations at very high concentrations,

61
00:04:11 --> 00:04:15
you do temperature shifts and
various things,

62
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
or you give them a big jolt of
electricity, and the next thing you

63
00:04:18 --> 00:04:22
know you get some DNA inside.
And it's not a very efficient

64
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
process, but all you need is one
molecule to get in one bacterium and

65
00:04:25 --> 00:04:29
then you're in business.
So that was another reason that

66
00:04:29 --> 00:04:33
this wasn't accepted right away.
Because this was not a phenomenon

67
00:04:33 --> 00:04:38
that could easily be repeated with
other bacteria.

68
00:04:38 --> 00:04:43
So it looked like it was something
perhaps special to streptococcus.

69
00:04:43 --> 00:04:47
And what did really change people's
understanding,

70
00:04:47 --> 00:04:52
or at least bring people to the
understanding that DNA could

71
00:04:52 --> 00:04:57
possibly be the genetic material
came about from the discovery of the

72
00:04:57 --> 00:05:02
actual structure of --
How the structure of DNA as a long

73
00:05:02 --> 00:05:06
molecule with complimentary strands
and the double helix,

74
00:05:06 --> 00:05:10
the little pictures I showed you
with the base pairs,

75
00:05:10 --> 00:05:14
which you know about,
and how the two strands which now

76
00:05:14 --> 00:05:18
I'm going to start emphasizing run
in opposite directions.

77
00:05:18 --> 00:05:22
We'll come back to that in a little
bit, but the 5 prime to 3 prime

78
00:05:22 --> 00:05:26
direction is this way on one end and
5 to 3 on the other.

79
00:05:26 --> 00:05:30
And just remember back here that
there's the 5 prime carbon and

80
00:05:30 --> 00:05:34
that's the 3 prime carbon.
So this is the 5 to 3 prime

81
00:05:34 --> 00:05:38
direction of the strand.
And then it twists up in

82
00:05:38 --> 00:05:43
3-dimensional space to form this
double helix.  And you've seen that

83
00:05:43 --> 00:05:48
movie several times.
So once that structure was

84
00:05:48 --> 00:05:52
discovered then people began to see
how these could possibly encode

85
00:05:52 --> 00:05:57
information.  It was clearly not
just a tetranucleotide

86
00:05:57 --> 00:06:02
of G, A, T, Cs.
But we didn't move immediately to

87
00:06:02 --> 00:06:06
that understanding.
And today, again sort of trying to

88
00:06:06 --> 00:06:10
show you how biological experiments
are done and how they're done by

89
00:06:10 --> 00:06:14
real people, I want to just go on
and tell you the key things that

90
00:06:14 --> 00:06:19
happened next.
So someone who was very struck by

91
00:06:19 --> 00:06:23
the results of Avery when they came
out was Erwin Chargaff who was at

92
00:06:23 --> 00:06:27
Columbia.  And,
in fact, my colleague Boris

93
00:06:27 --> 00:06:31
Magasanik whose office is next to
mine was a post-doc

94
00:06:31 --> 00:06:35
in Chargaff's lab.
So I've got a neighbor of mine who

95
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
worked with Chargaff.
And Chargaff was very struck by

96
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
this result from Avery and his
colleagues that you could take DNA

97
00:06:42 --> 00:06:46
and put it in another organism.
And here are a couple of quotes

98
00:06:46 --> 00:06:50
from his writing.
One that I'd liked.

99
00:06:50 --> 00:06:53
I've sort of had a sense of this in
my own research career,

100
00:06:53 --> 00:06:57
this kind of thing.  “I saw before
me in dark contours the beginning of

101
00:06:57 --> 00:07:01
a grammar of biology.”
He didn't really know quite how it

102
00:07:01 --> 00:07:05
worked but he sort of sensed that
someone here where you could get

103
00:07:05 --> 00:07:09
down to the language that biology
was written.  So he started some

104
00:07:09 --> 00:07:14
experiments.  And I started with the
conviction that if different DNA

105
00:07:14 --> 00:07:18
species exhibited different
biological activities there should

106
00:07:18 --> 00:07:23
exist chemically demonstrable
differences between deoxyribonucleic

107
00:07:23 --> 00:07:27
acids.  So he was able to start just
doing some simple chemical

108
00:07:27 --> 00:07:31
experiments to try and look at DNAs
from a whole variety of sources and

109
00:07:31 --> 00:07:37
see what he could learn.
And this was not at the structural

110
00:07:37 --> 00:07:44
level.  This was just at the
chemical level.

111
00:07:44 --> 00:07:51
But one thing he learned was that
the base content of DNA,

112
00:07:51 --> 00:07:58
that's the A, G, C, T part of it
varied widely between organisms.

113
00:07:58 --> 00:08:07
So this was what Chargaff found in

114
00:08:07 --> 00:08:11
his lab, key findings.
And that was important because if

115
00:08:11 --> 00:08:15
DNA was just a molecule of GATC,
just a tetranucleotide that every

116
00:08:15 --> 00:08:20
organism made then you'd expect to
find the same base composition in

117
00:08:20 --> 00:08:24
all organisms.
He didn't, so that finding

118
00:08:24 --> 00:08:29
essentially buried the monotonous
tetranucleotide hypothesis.

119
00:08:29 --> 00:08:38
Another thing he found was that DNA
was the same in different

120
00:08:38 --> 00:08:49
tissues --

121
00:08:49 --> 00:08:57
-- from the same organism --

122
00:08:57 --> 00:09:05
-- but the proteins varied.

123
00:09:05 --> 00:09:08
And that's a characteristic you'd
expect of something that was the

124
00:09:08 --> 00:09:12
genetic information from the cell
that all cells have to have sort of

125
00:09:12 --> 00:09:16
the major blueprint.
And if you had, even though

126
00:09:16 --> 00:09:19
proteins look like an attractive
possibility for that because they

127
00:09:19 --> 00:09:23
had so much variation,
this kind of finding wasn't

128
00:09:23 --> 00:09:27
consistent with it and it supported
the idea that DNA was the

129
00:09:27 --> 00:09:31
genetic material.
Well, the other thing he could do

130
00:09:31 --> 00:09:35
was he could measure the ATG and C
content of all these different DNAs.

131
00:09:35 --> 00:09:40
And he noticed some similarities
then.  And he extracted out of that

132
00:09:40 --> 00:09:44
a couple of generalizations.
One was that if you looked at the

133
00:09:44 --> 00:09:49
ratio of the purines,
those are the ones with the two

134
00:09:49 --> 00:09:54
rings, adenosine and guanidine over
the pyrimidines,

135
00:09:54 --> 00:09:58
those are the ones with the single
ring which were C and T,

136
00:09:58 --> 00:10:03
there are about one.
Another thing he noticed was that

137
00:10:03 --> 00:10:08
the ratio of A to T was about one
and the ratio of G to C was about

138
00:10:08 --> 00:10:14
one.  Now, that was an important
clue but it didn't lead to any

139
00:10:14 --> 00:10:19
immediate breakthrough,
even though maybe now that you know

140
00:10:19 --> 00:10:24
the structure you can see,
gee, if I had been there maybe I

141
00:10:24 --> 00:10:30
would have been smart enough to jump
on that number.

142
00:10:30 --> 00:10:35
So instead the work that led to the
structure of DNA now introduces a

143
00:10:35 --> 00:10:40
couple of other characters who
you've heard of a lot,

144
00:10:40 --> 00:10:45
Jim Watson and Francis Crick.
At the time that Avery made his

145
00:10:45 --> 00:10:50
discovery reporting DNA was
transformation,

146
00:10:50 --> 00:10:55
and Jim Watson described himself
later as a precocious college boy in

147
00:10:55 --> 00:11:01
Chicago who was consumed
by ornithology.

148
00:11:01 --> 00:11:06
So he was into bird watching.
That's what he was excited about at

149
00:11:06 --> 00:11:12
the time Avery did his experiment.
And Francis Crick at that point was

150
00:11:12 --> 00:11:17
a physicist, and he was in the
British Navy designing Navel mines.

151
00:11:17 --> 00:11:23
So that's where those two players
were at the time of Avery's results.

152
00:11:23 --> 00:11:29
So then both Francis Crick and Jim
Watson ended up in Cambridge,

153
00:11:29 --> 00:11:34
England about 1950.
I think Crick got there around 1949

154
00:11:34 --> 00:11:39
and Jim Watson got there in 1951.
Francis Crick was a grad student,

155
00:11:39 --> 00:11:44
35 years old at the time.  I'll show
you pictures in a minute.

156
00:11:44 --> 00:11:49
35 years old at the time and still
working on his PhD.

157
00:11:49 --> 00:11:54
So he was a pretty elderly grad
student, if you want to think of it

158
00:11:54 --> 00:11:59
that way.  And Jim Watson
was a young hot-shot.

159
00:11:59 --> 00:12:03
He had done his PhD working with
Salvador Luria who was at Indiana

160
00:12:03 --> 00:12:07
University at the time.
Salvador Luria was one of the Nobel

161
00:12:07 --> 00:12:11
Laureates at MIT.
He founded the Cancer Center,

162
00:12:11 --> 00:12:15
which is still here right across
from the main biology building.

163
00:12:15 --> 00:12:19
And Jim was a very, very bright and
brash young guy,

164
00:12:19 --> 00:12:23
and he had done his PhD with Salva
and then he went to Cambridge as

165
00:12:23 --> 00:12:27
well.  And the reason they both went
to Cambridge was they were attracted

166
00:12:27 --> 00:12:31
by the power of x-ray
crystallography.

167
00:12:31 --> 00:12:34
Now, I said a little work about that
earlier, that if you take x-rays and

168
00:12:34 --> 00:12:37
you bounce them off a crystal and
then measure the diffraction pattern

169
00:12:37 --> 00:12:41
you can work backwards by Fourier
transforms and whatnot to figure out

170
00:12:41 --> 00:12:44
what the underlying crystal
structure is.  For the purposes of

171
00:12:44 --> 00:12:48
this course the mechanics of how
that's done, we don't have to worry

172
00:12:48 --> 00:12:51
about that right now.
You just need to know that you can

173
00:12:51 --> 00:12:55
work backwards from the diffraction
pattern to figure out what the

174
00:12:55 --> 00:12:59
underlying structure was.
And I told you,

175
00:12:59 --> 00:13:03
when I introduced to proteins,
that the first clues that there were

176
00:13:03 --> 00:13:07
these regions of secondary structure,
alpha helices and beta sheets came

177
00:13:07 --> 00:13:12
because people saw characteristic
reflections in these diffraction

178
00:13:12 --> 00:13:16
patterns of certain proteins.
And I also told you the story of

179
00:13:16 --> 00:13:21
how Linus Pauling had gone to Oxford,
had gotten sick and tired of reading

180
00:13:21 --> 00:13:25
detective novels,
started to try and explain the

181
00:13:25 --> 00:13:29
refractions in a certain class of
proteins and came up with a model

182
00:13:29 --> 00:13:34
for the alpha helix.
And so that was the sort of thing

183
00:13:34 --> 00:13:38
that inspired Watson and Crick.
They were both interested in when

184
00:13:38 --> 00:13:43
one could get the structure of DNA.
Now, Cambridge also had a very good

185
00:13:43 --> 00:13:48
x-ray crystallogram group.
And just in passing it's

186
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
interesting as to why they didn't
come up with the structure of the

187
00:13:52 --> 00:13:57
alpha helix.  There were two things.
One was just lack of basic

188
00:13:57 --> 00:14:02
knowledge.
I told you that the peptide bond,

189
00:14:02 --> 00:14:06
if you remember I emphasized that
you cannot rotate it because the

190
00:14:06 --> 00:14:10
electrons are distributed.
Pauling was an outstanding chemist.

191
00:14:10 --> 00:14:14
He knew that fact.  And the folks
at Cambridge who were doing that

192
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
didn't learn this until later,
so their models were far less

193
00:14:18 --> 00:14:22
constrained because they could have
rotation around that bond.

194
00:14:22 --> 00:14:26
And the other one was just an
experimental thing that the size of

195
00:14:26 --> 00:14:30
the photographic plates they used in
the Cambridge lab were too small in

196
00:14:30 --> 00:14:34
the sense that they missed a key
reflection that Pauling knew about

197
00:14:34 --> 00:14:39
and they didn't know about.
So this combination led to them

198
00:14:39 --> 00:14:45
being scooped by the other group.
But nevertheless the group at

199
00:14:45 --> 00:14:51
Cambridge was absolutely outstanding
and at one of the top places in the

200
00:14:51 --> 00:14:57
world to do.  And I showed you a
couple of pictures when I was

201
00:14:57 --> 00:15:02
showing you the transition state.
Sort of what you get out of working

202
00:15:02 --> 00:15:07
backwards from these diffraction
patterns is they can measure regions

203
00:15:07 --> 00:15:12
of electron density,
and then you fit atoms or fit

204
00:15:12 --> 00:15:16
molecules to the patterns that you
see.  And if it's all working you

205
00:15:16 --> 00:15:21
can explain why there are bumps here.
There's an oxygen here and so on.

206
00:15:21 --> 00:15:26
There's another one.  This is an
ATP that's bound actually in a

207
00:15:26 --> 00:15:31
pocket in a protein.
But you can sort of see how

208
00:15:31 --> 00:15:36
beautifully the patterns of electron
density deduced from the x-ray

209
00:15:36 --> 00:15:41
crystallography will match the
chemical structures that we put on

210
00:15:41 --> 00:15:47
the board.  So that was the idea,
they were going to work out the

211
00:15:47 --> 00:15:52
structure of DNA.
Now, the thing about Watson and

212
00:15:52 --> 00:15:57
Crick, who at this point looked like
this, they didn't look inordinately

213
00:15:57 --> 00:16:02
distinguished.
In fact, Jim probably looked like,

214
00:16:02 --> 00:16:07
you've probably seen people who look
approximately like that around MIT.

215
00:16:07 --> 00:16:12
He would have fit in right here and
no one would have noticed.

216
00:16:12 --> 00:16:18
They were not actually x-ray
crystallographers.

217
00:16:18 --> 00:16:23
They were just trying to model
other people's data.

218
00:16:23 --> 00:16:28
And the best DNA crystallography
data was a young woman Roselyn

219
00:16:28 --> 00:16:33
Franklin who was working in London.
A very somewhat uneasy alliance with

220
00:16:33 --> 00:16:37
Maurice Wilkins.
And in trying to read the history

221
00:16:37 --> 00:16:41
it's a bit complicated because,
at least some of what I've read,

222
00:16:41 --> 00:16:46
I think that when Roslyn Franklin
arrived at the lab she was told this

223
00:16:46 --> 00:16:50
DNA structure problem was hers.
And Maurice Wilkins in whose lab

224
00:16:50 --> 00:16:54
she was working was told that he was
sort of working for her.

225
00:16:54 --> 00:16:59
So there was a bunch of confusion
in this.

226
00:16:59 --> 00:17:03
But, in any case,
Roslyn Franklin was collecting

227
00:17:03 --> 00:17:08
crystallographic data.
And Watson and Crick located some

228
00:17:08 --> 00:17:13
distance away in Cambridge were
trying to come up with models that

229
00:17:13 --> 00:17:18
could explain the structure of DNA.
And they learned about Roslyn's

230
00:17:18 --> 00:17:22
data.  And it was here data that
they used to work out the basis,

231
00:17:22 --> 00:17:27
her crystallographic data that they
used when they put together

232
00:17:27 --> 00:17:32
their structure.
So if it hadn't been for her they

233
00:17:32 --> 00:17:36
wouldn't have been able to make
their discovery.

234
00:17:36 --> 00:17:40
So part of the reason I'm dwelling
on this is I think their discovery

235
00:17:40 --> 00:17:44
of the structure of DNA was arguably
one of the great intellectual

236
00:17:44 --> 00:17:48
advances of our time.
It just opened doors.

237
00:17:48 --> 00:17:52
The whole field of molecular
biology became possible once people

238
00:17:52 --> 00:17:56
suddenly saw that DNA was
complimentary strands.

239
00:17:56 --> 00:18:00
You could almost immediately see
how you could copy genetic

240
00:18:00 --> 00:18:03
information.
It laid the groundwork for what

241
00:18:03 --> 00:18:07
later turned out to be,
you know, recombinant DNA and

242
00:18:07 --> 00:18:11
everything else.
So much of this pivots around this

243
00:18:11 --> 00:18:15
one discovery.
And I think I wouldn't be doing

244
00:18:15 --> 00:18:19
justice to this finding,
which you all have heard about for

245
00:18:19 --> 00:18:23
years and years,
if I had let you walk away from here

246
00:18:23 --> 00:18:27
thinking this was too young geniuses
who sat down in a room with some

247
00:18:27 --> 00:18:31
crystallographic data and emerged
with a structure that sort of

248
00:18:31 --> 00:18:35
changed the course of the
study of biology.

249
00:18:35 --> 00:18:38
And, as you can see,
changes our society and everything

250
00:18:38 --> 00:18:42
else.  There are a couple of
accounts of this,

251
00:18:42 --> 00:18:45
there are numerous accounts.
One that I found pretty interesting

252
00:18:45 --> 00:18:49
is called “The Eighth Day of
Creation,” if you ever want to read

253
00:18:49 --> 00:18:52
an interesting book on science.
This was Horace Judson's effort to

254
00:18:52 --> 00:18:56
try and put together a history of
this happening.

255
00:18:56 --> 00:19:00
And with all history he's
ultimately --

256
00:19:00 --> 00:19:03
You know, there are some judgment
calls by the historian,

257
00:19:03 --> 00:19:07
but this one certainly he tried to
be pretty fair-handed and

258
00:19:07 --> 00:19:11
even-handed and he tried to get at
the heart of what was going on.

259
00:19:11 --> 00:19:14
Watson wrote a book called “The
Double Helix”.

260
00:19:14 --> 00:19:18
Jim Watson's a very colorful
character, quite brash particularly

261
00:19:18 --> 00:19:22
when he was younger,
and that's reflected in this book.

262
00:19:22 --> 00:19:26
It's an interesting read.  Probably
more balanced point of view for sure

263
00:19:26 --> 00:19:30
in “The Eighth Day of Creation”.
And there are now a lot of other

264
00:19:30 --> 00:19:34
books.  But what I did,
just to try and do this in about a

265
00:19:34 --> 00:19:38
minute or two,
was I took a couple of the key

266
00:19:38 --> 00:19:42
things that happened during their
adventure of trying to work out the

267
00:19:42 --> 00:19:47
structure of DNA and just kind of
ran some of their missteps together,

268
00:19:47 --> 00:19:51
because even though this was a
marvelous discovery it just didn't

269
00:19:51 --> 00:19:55
happen.  So they started out,
they were inspired by Linus

270
00:19:55 --> 00:20:00
Pauling's discovery of
the alpha helix.

271
00:20:00 --> 00:20:04
And I don't know if you can remember
the story, but what Pauling decided

272
00:20:04 --> 00:20:08
to do when he was lying in bed and
with a strip of paper trying to work

273
00:20:08 --> 00:20:12
out the structure that was giving
these reflections in the crystal

274
00:20:12 --> 00:20:16
structure, he said I'm going to
start by ignoring the side chains.

275
00:20:16 --> 00:20:20
So that was a brilliant move in the
case of the alpha helix because he

276
00:20:20 --> 00:20:24
was then able to figure out that
that hydrogen bond between the

277
00:20:24 --> 00:20:28
carbonyl and the amino group,
you could see how if you got helix

278
00:20:28 --> 00:20:32
going it would repeat at exactly the
way that would give the reflections

279
00:20:32 --> 00:20:36
that were observed in
the crystallography.

280
00:20:36 --> 00:20:40
So that was how Watson and Crick
sort of did it.

281
00:20:40 --> 00:20:44
Linus Pauling had shown the way.
So they decided they would ignore

282
00:20:44 --> 00:20:48
the side chains of DNA.
So they started out by saying we

283
00:20:48 --> 00:20:52
won't consider the ATs,
the Gs and the Cs.  Well,

284
00:20:52 --> 00:20:56
given what you know about the
structure of DNA that was not a

285
00:20:56 --> 00:21:01
helpful move in trying to work out
the structure of DNA.

286
00:21:01 --> 00:21:05
Another thing,
for example, that happened was that

287
00:21:05 --> 00:21:09
Jim Watson has no lack of
self-confidence.

288
00:21:09 --> 00:21:13
And so it turned out when he went
to hear scientific talks he didn't

289
00:21:13 --> 00:21:18
take notes.  And so he went to hear
a talk on x-ray crystallography

290
00:21:18 --> 00:21:22
given by Roslyn Franklin,
but he didn't quite remember the

291
00:21:22 --> 00:21:26
numbers right.
He got the facts a little jumbled,

292
00:21:26 --> 00:21:30
and he and Francis spent a while
trying to design models to data that

293
00:21:30 --> 00:21:35
wasn't the right data.
It was just not quite remembered

294
00:21:35 --> 00:21:41
right, so there was kind of an
inefficiency there.

295
00:21:41 --> 00:21:46
And then Jim had a bias almost to
the end that the phosphate backbones

296
00:21:46 --> 00:21:51
they knew would somehow be on the
inside and the bases would be on the

297
00:21:51 --> 00:21:57
outside of the structure.
So if that's your sort of starting

298
00:21:57 --> 00:22:02
place then it's sort of hard.
So Watson, excuse me,

299
00:22:02 --> 00:22:07
Francis Crick was beginning to
suspect that maybe the bases were

300
00:22:07 --> 00:22:12
important.  So he hired a young
mathematician.

301
00:22:12 --> 00:22:16
And he said, “Can you see if you
could work out whether there would

302
00:22:16 --> 00:22:21
be any chemical attraction between
any pairs of bases?

303
00:22:21 --> 00:22:26
And the young mathematician came
back and said that he thought G

304
00:22:26 --> 00:22:31
might go with C and A with T.
And given what happened here you

305
00:22:31 --> 00:22:36
might have thought that a light bulb
would have gone off,

306
00:22:36 --> 00:22:41
but it didn't.  And, in fact,
Chargaff visited them and the light

307
00:22:41 --> 00:22:46
bulb went off for nobody.
And, in fact, Chargaff wasn't a

308
00:22:46 --> 00:22:51
terribly big fan of what Watson and
Crick were trying to do.

309
00:22:51 --> 00:22:56
So the pieces are piling up but
still not there.

310
00:22:56 --> 00:23:01
Then a big experimental advance
came from Roslyn Franklin.

311
00:23:01 --> 00:23:05
And that was she discovered that the
DNA that they had been diffracting

312
00:23:05 --> 00:23:10
was actually a mixture of two forms.
So there were actually two

313
00:23:10 --> 00:23:15
structures in the mix that were
contributing to the diffractions.

314
00:23:15 --> 00:23:20
She was able to separate out the
two kinds of DNA,

315
00:23:20 --> 00:23:25
DNA-A and DNA-B she called it.
And so now this gave a much clearer

316
00:23:25 --> 00:23:30
diffraction pattern,
and that's the diffraction pattern

317
00:23:30 --> 00:23:35
that she saw.
And Watson and Crick managed to get

318
00:23:35 --> 00:23:41
a look at this data.
And it's a little complicated how

319
00:23:41 --> 00:23:46
that happened,
but Crick realized almost right away

320
00:23:46 --> 00:23:51
that there were two strands running
in opposite directions.

321
00:23:51 --> 00:23:57
So he know knew it was 5 to 3 in
one direction and 5 to 3 in the

322
00:23:57 --> 00:24:02
other direction like that.
So you might have thought they were

323
00:24:02 --> 00:24:07
home-free, but no.
Jim Watson immediately built a

324
00:24:07 --> 00:24:12
model that paired like with like,
A with A, T with T, G with G.  They

325
00:24:12 --> 00:24:16
wrote it up and they were ready to
submit the paper.

326
00:24:16 --> 00:24:21
And they gave a presentation to
their colleagues at the lab in

327
00:24:21 --> 00:24:26
Cambridge.  And they were shot down.
And one of the key things was they

328
00:24:26 --> 00:24:31
learned the chemical fact that most
of the textbooks were wrong at that

329
00:24:31 --> 00:24:36
time in the way that they depicted
the structure of guanine.

330
00:24:36 --> 00:24:46
If you look in your textbook,

331
00:24:46 --> 00:24:58
excuse me, here.

332
00:24:58 --> 00:25:03
So if you were to look in a textbook
today you'd see guanine like this,

333
00:25:03 --> 00:25:09
but there is another way you could
draw this.

334
00:25:09 --> 00:25:23
So this you may remember when we

335
00:25:23 --> 00:25:30
were talking about
phosphoenolpyruvate that this is an

336
00:25:30 --> 00:25:36
enol form and this is a keto form.
And this is the way most of the

337
00:25:36 --> 00:25:40
textbooks were showing guanine at
the time.  So they were looking at

338
00:25:40 --> 00:25:44
the structure of guanine in
textbooks.  And if you were trying

339
00:25:44 --> 00:25:48
to work out schemes for putting
bases together you can see what's

340
00:25:48 --> 00:25:52
going on up here would be very
different.  And if we have a

341
00:25:52 --> 00:25:56
hydrogen here versus if we have an
oxygen, if you're trying to say make

342
00:25:56 --> 00:26:00
hydrogen bonds at that particular
position, I think all of you

343
00:26:00 --> 00:26:04
understand hydrogen bonds well
enough to see how that

344
00:26:04 --> 00:26:09
would throw you off.
So once that insight came,

345
00:26:09 --> 00:26:13
once they learned that then the rest
of the structure came pretty fast.

346
00:26:13 --> 00:26:18
And there's a movie about this.
One of the nice things in it was

347
00:26:18 --> 00:26:22
sort of trying to recreate the
experience where I think it was

348
00:26:22 --> 00:26:26
Watson who was shuffling these base
pairs around.  And he suddenly

349
00:26:26 --> 00:26:31
realized that you could set up base
pairs with A and T and with G and C,

350
00:26:31 --> 00:26:35
and when you looked at them you
could see they were geometrically

351
00:26:35 --> 00:26:40
exactly the same shape.
You could just take the shape of the

352
00:26:40 --> 00:26:44
G and C pair and lay it right down
on the A and T pair.

353
00:26:44 --> 00:26:49
And then you could see how you
could build either a G-C or an A-T

354
00:26:49 --> 00:26:53
pair into the repeating structure of
this DNA and it would be compatible.

355
00:26:53 --> 00:26:57
So they built a model and they
thought, we can just hit the lights

356
00:26:57 --> 00:27:05
for a second here maybe.

357
00:27:05 --> 00:27:08
I just want you to see what that
first model looked like.

358
00:27:08 --> 00:27:12
It looks like something you could
hack together in a chemistry lab.

359
00:27:12 --> 00:27:16
They had the bases cut out of metal.
And you can see just,

360
00:27:16 --> 00:27:20
you know, here the retort sort of
stands using chemistry and various

361
00:27:20 --> 00:27:24
clamps that you would use for
clamping a flask or something if

362
00:27:24 --> 00:27:28
you're doing a chemical lab.
That's the stuff that they were

363
00:27:28 --> 00:27:32
using to put the model together.
And they published then a paper in

364
00:27:32 --> 00:27:38
Nature that told about this result.
That's the entire paper reporting

365
00:27:38 --> 00:27:43
the structure of DNA.
And maybe you can see there's a

366
00:27:43 --> 00:27:49
little hand-drawn double helix right
there that captures the elements.

367
00:27:49 --> 00:27:54
That is the paper, and that was in
the journal Nature.

368
00:27:54 --> 00:28:00
And it had in it, right near the
end, one of the coyest sentences in

369
00:28:00 --> 00:28:05
the scientific literature.
They didn't want to go into all the

370
00:28:05 --> 00:28:10
details that if you had an A paired
with G and G paired with a C and you

371
00:28:10 --> 00:28:16
pulled them apart then you could
replicate the molecule by redoing it.

372
00:28:16 --> 00:28:21
So all they said was,
“It has not escaped our notice that

373
00:28:21 --> 00:28:26
the specific pairings we
expostulated immediately suggests a

374
00:28:26 --> 00:28:32
copying mechanism for DNA.
So this is a picture of Jim Watson

375
00:28:32 --> 00:28:37
wearing short pants at Cold Spring
Harbor in 1953 reporting

376
00:28:37 --> 00:28:42
this structure of DNA.
Cold Spring Harbor is on Long Island.

377
00:28:42 --> 00:28:47
It's been one of the Meccas for
molecule biology since the 1940s.

378
00:28:47 --> 00:28:52
They have a famous symposium once a
year.  The topic changes every year

379
00:28:52 --> 00:28:57
and rarely repeats.
And it was at one of those symposia

380
00:28:57 --> 00:29:02
--
This was the year that they

381
00:29:02 --> 00:29:07
discovered the structure of DNA.
And there was Watson.  So two years

382
00:29:07 --> 00:29:12
ago they had another meeting,
a special meeting just exactly this

383
00:29:12 --> 00:29:17
time of year.  It was in February
within a couple of days of right now.

384
00:29:17 --> 00:29:22
So I gave this lecture and I showed
the student in the class that this

385
00:29:22 --> 00:29:27
year, I said here's a picture of Jim
Watson displaying the structure.

386
00:29:27 --> 00:29:32
They're having a meeting 50 years
later in 2003.

387
00:29:32 --> 00:29:35
And I'm going down there.
I'm asked to give a talk.

388
00:29:35 --> 00:29:38
And I'll come back and I'll tell
you what it was like.

389
00:29:38 --> 00:29:41
So I gave my lecture.
I dashed out to the airport.

390
00:29:41 --> 00:29:45
I hoped on the plane.  I went down
and I registered.

391
00:29:45 --> 00:29:48
They gave me, you know,
the stuff to get into my room,

392
00:29:48 --> 00:29:51
a little envelope with the key card
and things.  And I went up to my

393
00:29:51 --> 00:29:55
room.  And I took out the key card.
And what did I find myself looking

394
00:29:55 --> 00:29:58
at?  The same picture I had shown to
the class just a couple

395
00:29:58 --> 00:30:01
of hours earlier.
Here's another picture of Jim the

396
00:30:01 --> 00:30:05
way he looked at the time when he
made this amazing discovery.

397
00:30:05 --> 00:30:09
That's Salvador Luria who I
mentioned.  I tell you about him in

398
00:30:09 --> 00:30:12
a subsequent lecture.
I was at another meeting a few

399
00:30:12 --> 00:30:16
years earlier where some of the
old-timers were razzing each other,

400
00:30:16 --> 00:30:20
and someone showed this picture.
And then they got up and they gave

401
00:30:20 --> 00:30:23
it a title.  And that was “Picture
of a Man Picking His Own Pockets”.

402
00:30:23 --> 00:30:27
So they would tease each other a lot.
And I'm hoping maybe you'll get a

403
00:30:27 --> 00:30:31
chance to hear a little bit
more about that soon.

404
00:30:31 --> 00:30:35
This is what Jim Watson looks like
now.  I asked to get a picture taken

405
00:30:35 --> 00:30:39
just so you could see he's still
around and is very active and still

406
00:30:39 --> 00:30:43
very controversial.
This doesn't make much of a

407
00:30:43 --> 00:30:48
difference.  Here's a picture of
Watson and Crick a little bit later

408
00:30:48 --> 00:30:52
just sitting out on a porch in Cold
Spring Harbor.

409
00:30:52 --> 00:30:56
It's sort of right on the edge of a
bay down there in a very relaxed

410
00:30:56 --> 00:31:00
kind of atmosphere that still
permeates molecule biology

411
00:31:00 --> 00:31:04
research to this day.
Francis Crick just died last July at

412
00:31:04 --> 00:31:06
the age of 88,
so we've just lost the link to one

413
00:31:06 --> 00:31:09
of the two people who did this
amazing experiment.

414
00:31:09 --> 00:31:11
OK.  So I want to then set things
up for the details of DNA

415
00:31:11 --> 00:31:14
replication.  So there was a basic
principle that came across from this

416
00:31:14 --> 00:31:16
that you could see how this could
work, that DNA was sort of like

417
00:31:16 --> 00:31:18
having a photograph and a negative.
And so the information is actually

418
00:31:18 --> 00:31:21
in there twice.
It's just in different forms.

419
00:31:21 --> 00:31:23
And when I tell you about DNA
repair in another lecture you can

420
00:31:23 --> 00:31:26
maybe see already how useful that is
because if you damage one strand

421
00:31:26 --> 00:31:28
you're not really out of luck
because you've still got the

422
00:31:28 --> 00:31:33
information in the other strand.
And you could probably,

423
00:31:33 --> 00:31:41
on the basis of that, device a
repair strategy if you thought about

424
00:31:41 --> 00:31:48
it.  But more importantly for DNA
replication finally gave an insight

425
00:31:48 --> 00:31:55
to this thing that had been vexing
people forever.

426
00:31:55 --> 00:32:03
If you had to have all this
information for making a cell,

427
00:32:03 --> 00:32:10
and every time a cell divided and
you saw how it can happen pretty

428
00:32:10 --> 00:32:17
quickly with something like a
bacterium of yeast,

429
00:32:17 --> 00:32:25
how could you accurately copy all
that DNA, excuse me,

430
00:32:25 --> 00:32:29
all that genetic information?
How is it stored?

431
00:32:29 --> 00:32:29
How could it be done?
And once you saw ah, it's just a

432
00:32:29 --> 00:32:29
matter of separating the strands,
and if there's an A there put a T

433
00:32:29 --> 00:32:29
there, if there's a C you put a G
and so on, was a huge breakthrough.

434
00:32:29 --> 00:32:30
But that then didn't tell people
how DNA replicated or even if this

435
00:32:30 --> 00:32:30
is the mechanism.
You can actually come up with all

436
00:32:30 --> 00:32:30
kinds of models for how you could
replicate things based on this

437
00:32:30 --> 00:32:30
principle, including crisscrossing
between strands and all

438
00:32:30 --> 00:32:43
sorts of things.
The predominant model and perhaps

439
00:32:43 --> 00:33:07
the simplest one was called
semi-conservative.

440
00:33:07 --> 00:33:15
And it thought of the problem in

441
00:33:15 --> 00:33:21
this kind of way,
that if you had two strands of the

442
00:33:21 --> 00:33:26
original DNA molecule and then you
pulled them apart that one of the

443
00:33:26 --> 00:33:32
strands here would become one of the
strands of the daughter,

444
00:33:32 --> 00:33:38
and then the new one would be here
and the same thing would happen on

445
00:33:38 --> 00:33:44
the other side.
And then if you did it again this

446
00:33:44 --> 00:33:50
thing would happen again with a new
strand.  This time the skinny strand

447
00:33:50 --> 00:33:56
here would be like this,
the skinny strand here would be like

448
00:33:56 --> 00:34:02
this, and then this one again.
We'd have one that was nearly

449
00:34:02 --> 00:34:08
synthesized plus one of the
originals.  So this model was one of

450
00:34:08 --> 00:34:14
the simplest because it kept this
strand intact throughout the whole

451
00:34:14 --> 00:34:19
process while some of the other
models had them being patched back

452
00:34:19 --> 00:34:25
together, all based on the idea that
A pairs with T and G pairs with C.

453
00:34:25 --> 00:34:31
But proving that this was the
correct model was then another

454
00:34:31 --> 00:34:36
important advance.
And that was done by Frank Stahl and

455
00:34:36 --> 00:34:40
Matt Meselson.
Actually, I think I'll skip this

456
00:34:40 --> 00:34:44
for right now.
Matt is a professor up at Harvard,

457
00:34:44 --> 00:34:48
just up at Harvard Square not very
far from here,

458
00:34:48 --> 00:34:52
still very active.
Frank Stahl is a professor out in

459
00:34:52 --> 00:34:56
Oregon.  He's still active.
So one of the differences about

460
00:34:56 --> 00:35:01
this course is a lot of the things
I'm telling you about --

461
00:35:01 --> 00:35:06
And this is pretty old stuff right
now, right, molecule biology.

462
00:35:06 --> 00:35:11
The people who did these are still
around and very active.

463
00:35:11 --> 00:35:16
This is most of modern biology is a
pretty young scientist,

464
00:35:16 --> 00:35:22
and many of the major characters are
still running around and with us

465
00:35:22 --> 00:35:27
today.  So, anyway,
what Matt and Frank were at Caltech.

466
00:35:27 --> 00:35:32
And they with a bunch of other

467
00:35:32 --> 00:35:37
students had an apartment.
And they were sitting around trying

468
00:35:37 --> 00:35:42
to work out a way to figure out this
model.  And they came up with an

469
00:35:42 --> 00:35:47
idea, and that was to see if you
could differentially label what we

470
00:35:47 --> 00:35:52
might call “old DNA” and the “new
DNA” here.  And since it's

471
00:35:52 --> 00:35:57
chemically the same stuff it's a bit
of a trick.  How do you tell old DNA

472
00:35:57 --> 00:36:03
from new DNA?
So their idea was since nitrogen

473
00:36:03 --> 00:36:09
comes in two different isotopes,
N14 which is the common one and N15

474
00:36:09 --> 00:36:16
with is one mass heavier,
that maybe you could start out with

475
00:36:16 --> 00:36:22
the DNA, for example,
grown in N15.  And then when you

476
00:36:22 --> 00:36:28
started replication switch to N14.
And then you'd be able to tell,

477
00:36:28 --> 00:36:32
if you could separate these
molecules on the basis of their

478
00:36:32 --> 00:36:36
density since the one with the N15
would be heavier than the one with

479
00:36:36 --> 00:36:41
the N14, then maybe you could work
this out.  And the story goes,

480
00:36:41 --> 00:36:45
this has been written, they were
sitting arguing about this,

481
00:36:45 --> 00:36:50
or talking about this idea at the
table.  And it was a good idea but

482
00:36:50 --> 00:36:54
there was a problem.
And that was how could you separate

483
00:36:54 --> 00:36:59
the two kinds of DNA based
on their density?

484
00:36:59 --> 00:37:02
So they had a piece of fingernail
and they were trying to see whether

485
00:37:02 --> 00:37:06
they could get it to float by
dissolving more and more sugar.

486
00:37:06 --> 00:37:09
And they figured if they added more
and more sugar the water would get

487
00:37:09 --> 00:37:13
denser and denser so the could float
the fingernail.

488
00:37:13 --> 00:37:16
And they weren't able to do it.
But all chemists made a periodic,

489
00:37:16 --> 00:37:20
probably some places here at MIT,
they had a periodic chart right in

490
00:37:20 --> 00:37:23
their living room.
So they went and they looked.

491
00:37:23 --> 00:37:27
And then they looked at sodium.
And they went down the periodic

492
00:37:27 --> 00:37:31
table and then they saw cesium.
And thought maybe,

493
00:37:31 --> 00:37:35
you know, if you took a solution of
cesium chloride and you put it a

494
00:37:35 --> 00:37:39
centrifuge and you spun really hard
then you'd get a gradient of varying

495
00:37:39 --> 00:37:43
concentrations,
of slightly different concentrations

496
00:37:43 --> 00:37:47
of cesium chloride.
And that they could tune that to a

497
00:37:47 --> 00:37:51
range that would discriminate
between the heavy and the lighter

498
00:37:51 --> 00:37:55
forms of DNA.  So the experiment
they did is known as the

499
00:37:55 --> 00:37:59
Meselson-Stahl experiment.
But, as I say, these are names that

500
00:37:59 --> 00:38:05
come from real people.
And the idea was pretty simple.

501
00:38:05 --> 00:38:13
They grew the bacteria for many
generations --

502
00:38:13 --> 00:38:22
-- in N15 medium.

503
00:38:22 --> 00:38:30
This is the so-called heavy

504
00:38:30 --> 00:38:37
or H isotope --

505
00:38:37 --> 00:38:45
-- of nitrogen.
And then that time equals zero in

506
00:38:45 --> 00:38:53
their experiment,
when they're ready to start the

507
00:38:53 --> 00:39:01
experiment they switched to medium
with N14, which we'll think of as

508
00:39:01 --> 00:39:09
the light or the L isotope.
And then they isolated DNA --

509
00:39:09 --> 00:39:21
-- after let's say increasing rounds

510
00:39:21 --> 00:39:31
of replication that you could tell
simply by measuring how much DNA was

511
00:39:31 --> 00:39:41
in your bacterial culture when the
bacteria had doubled their DNA.

512
00:39:41 --> 00:39:47
And this is the data they got which
looks something like this.

513
00:39:47 --> 00:39:53
In fact, in this case the
blackboard representation is pretty

514
00:39:53 --> 00:39:59
close.  So this is cesium chloride.
And it has been centrifuged very

515
00:39:59 --> 00:40:05
hard so that there's a gradient now
that's light at the top and a little

516
00:40:05 --> 00:40:11
heavier at the bottom
of the gradient.

517
00:40:11 --> 00:40:14
There's a little more cesium
chloride per mil here then there is

518
00:40:14 --> 00:40:18
there in the tube.
And I'll just give us three little

519
00:40:18 --> 00:40:22
sort of reference marks here.
So what they found when they

520
00:40:22 --> 00:40:26
started was that all of the DNA was
at that position down

521
00:40:26 --> 00:40:32
at the heavy end.
And then this is after one

522
00:40:32 --> 00:40:40
generation.  So the DNA has now
doubled.  What they found was that

523
00:40:40 --> 00:40:49
all the DNA was now at this
intermediate position.

524
00:40:49 --> 00:40:58
And after two generations or two DNA

525
00:40:58 --> 00:41:04
replications they now found that
some of the DNA was here,

526
00:41:04 --> 00:41:10
some of the DNA was there.
And if they went to three or more

527
00:41:10 --> 00:41:16
what they saw was they began to pile
stuff up there.

528
00:41:16 --> 00:41:21
And I think most of you could
probably make the connection between

529
00:41:21 --> 00:41:27
that data and that picture that I've
got up there.  This is

530
00:41:27 --> 00:41:32
the heavy-heavy DNA.
This is the heavy-light.

531
00:41:32 --> 00:41:38
So this would be heavy-heavy,
heavy-light, light-heavy.  After one

532
00:41:38 --> 00:41:44
round it will all be here.
After two we have heavy-light,

533
00:41:44 --> 00:41:50
but this one is light-light,
light-light, light-heavy.

534
00:41:50 --> 00:41:56
And so now we've got light-light,
the heavy-light, no heavy-heavy is

535
00:41:56 --> 00:42:01
ever going to show up again.
And the longer you do this the more

536
00:42:01 --> 00:42:06
you'll get the light accumulating.
A very simple experiment done by

537
00:42:06 --> 00:42:11
real people but enormously powerful
because now it showed that this

538
00:42:11 --> 00:42:15
basic idea, you have the photograph
and negative, you pull them apart

539
00:42:15 --> 00:42:20
and copy them was right.
So at this point you begin to see

540
00:42:20 --> 00:42:25
why data of Avery's that before
people had trouble accepting,

541
00:42:25 --> 00:42:30
all of a sudden now it was really
you needed a CYD and A was

542
00:42:30 --> 00:42:34
the genetic material.
And this is what sort of ushered in

543
00:42:34 --> 00:42:38
this great burst of molecular
biology.  So in the next lecture

544
00:42:38 --> 00:42:42
what we're going to start doing now
is once you, this is all great,

545
00:42:42 --> 00:42:45
but once we start figuring out how
to replicate it we're going to have

546
00:42:45 --> 00:42:49
to get down to enzymes and
biochemical steps.

547
00:42:49 --> 00:42:52
And there are some formidable
challenges to replicating DNA,

548
00:42:52 --> 00:42:56
and it's also awesome.  I'll tell
you at the beginning of next lecture

549
00:42:56 --> 00:43:00
how much DNA we have and just
how accurate it is.

550
00:43:00 --> 00:43:03
It always blows me away.
I'll see you then.  Take care.
