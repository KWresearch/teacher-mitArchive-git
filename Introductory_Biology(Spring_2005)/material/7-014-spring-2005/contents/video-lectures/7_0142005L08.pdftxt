Transcript â€“ Lecture 8 

Let's get started. So I'm going to  finish up energy today. And then we're going to 
begin sort of section more or less we'll ca ll it molecular b iology but it's sort of dealing 
with the issues that revolve around the d iscovery that DNA was the genetic materia l 
and then working through how peop le understood how information got from the DNA 
into everything else, how things were regulated. There are an incred ibly large 
number of important discoveries that form the foundation of how we think about 
biology that are going to come out in this next section, but before I do that I just 
want to  finish up this section that I talked to you about, about energy. 

And I hope as we go along here you're going to see how some of these sort of 
disparate parts of the course beg in to come together. Almost everything we're going 
to be ta lking about now is going to be needing energy such as replicating DNA or 
making proteins and all sorts of things. And  those are driven ultimately by ATP. And 
what I've been trying to talk to about for the last lecture or two is how the cell gets 
the ATP, the energy money that it needs to make things. 

We ta lked through glycolysis, this ancient, ancient way of getting a coup le of ATPs 
out of a molecule of sugar so well- imbedded in our genetic makeup it's in almost a ll 
organisms. And then I ta lked last lecture about this other princip le which must have 
come up very, very early in evolution. Aga in, it's used by a ll organisms. And that's 
the principle of capturing the energy that's inherent in a proton gradient across a 
membrane. 

And I talked to you then about the idea then the way it worked was that the cell 
would have something in its membrane that would be a proton pump and it would 
pump the proton from one side of the membrane to the other. So it's working 
against the gradient. So it's doing energy. So there are a coup le of different ways 
energy needs to be provided. It could be provided by some kind of light energy, and 
that's what drives photosynthesis. 

I'll say a  few words about that. Or in the case of respiration w ith the oxidative 
phosphorylation, I showed you how it was the electrons sort of descend  in stepwise 
fashion down from one state to another. There's energy given off,  free energy is 
available, and that can be used to power the pump. And once the proton grad ient is 
made then the cells can turn it around and use the energy that's in that proton 
gradient to make ATP. 

So in resp iration remember the trick was then to take those two pyruvates, burn 
them all the way down to carbon d ioxide and water, make as many ATPs and NADHs 
as you could, then take the NADHs, use them  to make a proton grad ient and 
eventua lly, if you will, convert everything into ATP so you've got it as energy. Our 
cells do it. That part, respiration and the oxidative phosphorylation is done in 
mitochondria, which I said sort of came from bacteria that were captured at some 
point. 

Here's a picture of a mitochondrion. It still looks more or less like a bacterium. And I 
showed you the little parts that are in there. It was funny. Right after lecture I went 
back to my lab. I picked up a recent issue of Science. And I opened up to a page that 
said something about rats that had been bred to be very poor at aerobic exercise. 

And it went on to ta lk about the hea lth problems they had. And there was a sentence 
in there that they think the underlying cause is by breeding these rats and selection 
for rats that are poor at doing aerobic exercise. What they think it all stems from  is 
having very inefficient mitochondria that don't work nearly as well. And that would 
make a lot of sense. I was going to scan that article but we had some technical 
issues this morning. 

Maybe I can show it to you next lecture. OK. So  the one last thing then that I want 
to do is I want to say a few words about photosynthesis because that actually 
preceded respiration. Respiration couldn't evolve until there was oxygen in the 
atmosphere. So probably the first use or certa inly one of the first uses of the proton 
gradient happened in this scale of evolution and put here somewhere maybe 3. 

4 b illion years ago or so when what I had called photosynthesis -- -- release I on day 
one  in the sort of trivial fashion. This is known as cyclic -- -- photo phosphorylation. 
And the princip le is relatively simple. It's to capture the energy in sunlight -- -- to 
make a proton gradient. And that then can be used, as you now know, to make ATP. 
So in order to capture energy from sunlight nature had to evolve molecules that are 
able to absorb in the appropriate wavelength range. 

You know the names of those molecules. Chlorophyll come in two principle species. 
You don't have to remember the structure. What you can see is a lot of conjugated 
double-bonds. That's how you sort of tune the absorption of a molecule. If you want 
to make it absorb a longer and longer wavelength you start hooking together double 
bonds. And you can set it up sort of you can get a molecule to absorb at just about 
any maximum absorption, any wavelength you want. 

So chlorophyll is able to absorb  this energy. And the principle of this is what 
happens. You have this chlorophyll and it absorbs a photon. And an electron gets 
excited so  it basica lly moves to another orb ita l. It's farther away from the nucleus. 
It's easier now  for that electron to get lost than  it was before. Now, if nothing was 
happening that electron would eventua lly just fa ll down to its ground state and you'd 
lose all the energy as heat. 

So what happens in photosynthesis, though, is that the electron  falls back down to 
the ground state again in a series of steps. And how this happens, electrons are 
basically getting passed from one carrier to another. And the same principle as we 
saw in resp iration applies in that at each phase in here a proton is pumped. Now, the 
out and the in are reversed from what it says in resp iration. 

You have notes on resp iration, or should anyway. But the in and the out, as you'll 
see,  it's sort of an arbitrary. You sort of take a frame of reference and then 
something's in and something's out. The point is that in both of them protons go 
from one side of the membrane to the other and you get more on one side, you 
pump them in one direction and they flow back in the other. 

And the in and the out is sort of an arbitrary way of describ ing what's happening, but 
in both cases the key thing is that you're pump ing electrons out. And then these can 

be used to make ATP, as we ta lked about with ATP synthesis. In this case the 
electrons eventua lly end up back on the chlorophyll. And so that's why it's ca lled 
cyclic phosphorylation. 

What you get out of this, as you can see, is ATP. So this was probably a really b ig 
deal in evolution because the current thinking is perhaps there was an RNA world 
that's still sort of being debated. At some point it's clear that somewhere around 3.8 
billion years or so something that looks sort of like a present-day bacterium arose, 
probably ate molecules that had a lready been made in the sort of primord ial soup, 
but when those started to run out then it needed other ways of making energy. 

It needed other ways of making carbon. Here's a way of getting energy, but what's 
available to make more organic molecules is only carbon dioxide. And if you 
remember that little thing I showed you of if we're going  from a methyl to a hydroxyl 
to an a ldehyde to an acid -- -- to CO2, that direction is oxidation and that direction is 
reduction. So if we go in that direction and we end up generating NADH because 
we're taking electrons and giving them to something else, if we want to go the other 
way if we're starting w ith C02 what we need to do is we need to have a supp ly of 
reducing power so we can take the C02 and get  it down to a ll the less-oxidized states 
that are necessary for building a ll the molecules that we've been talking about. 

So making ATP was a great idea, but the cell still needed to have some form of 
reducing agent. And what they used was they used hydrogen sulfide. This is at least 
one of the major ways that it was done. And so  there is a very slight tw ist here. This 
is NADP. It's the same molecule as NAD except there's an extra phosphorylation. And 
the one w ith the phosphate on it tends to be used in biosynthetic reactions, but 
otherwise it's exactly the same thing. 

It's an electron banking thing. And what this gave was NADPH p lus sulfur p lus a 
hydrogen. So sulfur is a waste product. Here's the reducing power. Here's the ATP. 
That's what those organisms need to be able to synthesize new organic material 
without having to have pre-made molecules. A really big deal in evolution. And the 
idea  for making ATP is based on this use of establishing a proton grad ient, the same 
principle we've seen aga in. 

Now, there's another possible source of reducing power, and that would be to use 
water as the source of the reducing power. But in order to do that you've got to put 
more energy  into it. And this system wasn't able to handle it. But that happened 
soon enough w ith the development of what I called on the first day photosynthesis 
release II, which is technica lly known as noncyclic photophosphorylation. 

Again, it uses the energy of sunlight. But the tw ist this time, it not only makes ATP, 
it also makes NADPH, it makes reducing power at the same time. So you can see 
that is a really major advance. If you can use sunlight to make both of them now 
you're rea lly efficient. So this is how this one works. It's related to the other one. 
And the first part  is more or less the same idea. 

A photon is absorbed by a molecule of chlorophyll. It kicks the chlorophyll up to an 
activated state where the electrons are at a higher orb ita l far away. It wants to come 
back down. Energy is going to be released. So electrons gets passed, protons get 
pumped from one side of a membrane to another. Except this time, instead of 
coming back this lands in a different chlorophyll that has just recently lost a pair of 
electrons. 

But there's a new energy input here that kicks this chlorophyll up to an even higher 
energy state than this one. And as these electrons start to come down the energy hill 
there's enough energy here to take a molecule of NADP+ plus a hydrogen ion and 
give NADPH. There's one thing that this isn't going to work like a cycle or a machine 
yet. Anybody see what hasn't been taken care of yet? Say aga in. 

Send the electrons back to this chlorophyll, exactly. However, the way the energetics 
are structured now the cells were able to take reducing power from here and 
generate 2H+ p lus a ha lf of an oxygen molecule. And this would rea lly be two waters 
giving four hydrogens and one oxygen molecule. So what you can see here now, 
there are a coup le of rea lly important things about this. 

It needs more energy. It makes ATP and NADPH which leaves the cell able to carry 
out biosynthesis. And the third thing, which is an incredib le influence on our p lanet, 
it started to generate oxygen as a waste product. And it's really a mixed blessing. I 
mean oxygen is very reactive. It damages our DNA. It damages our proteins. We 
have an amazing number of defenses against oxygen. But, on the other hand, as it 
accumulated in the atmosphere and organisms slowly over evolutionary time learned 
to dea l w ith it, it then set us up for the possibility of resp iration which, as you can 
see,  is 18 times more efficient than in that ancient way of using glycolysis to make 
energy out of sugars. 

So that's more or less the story. This part is ca lled photosystem II. This assembly of 
stuff is photosystem I. And I just wanted to show you this next slide because 
chlorophyll isn't just floating around like this. As you might guess, it's bound into 
proteins and things. And someone has figured out the structure of photosystem I. It 
consists of 12 proteins, 96 chlorophylls and about 30 other molecules. 

And what it rea lly does is it functions as an antenna. Some of the other molecules 
can absorb  it at wavelengths that are different from chlorophyll. And a ll the energy 
gets funneled into  the chlorophyll and into this process. And you'll probab ly 
recognize by now that proteins here we're seeing alpha helices and beta sheets in 
here as part of this structure. So the first organisms that learned how to do this were 
organisms we now know as cyanobacteria. 

They're a kind of bacteria that has two membranes like E. coli and like the other 
ones that we've ta lked about. You're familiar w ith these. There's the green scum you 
see on ponds. Here's a close-up. Sometimes they grow as filaments, the cells in a 
cha in. You notice they're green. They're making chlorophyll. And what happened in 
plants was that apparently something probab ly related to the present-day 
cyanobacteria got trapped inside some early progenitor of what we now know as 
plants and green algae. 

And this trapped bacterium became a chlorop last. And it had a ll the machinery 
necessary to carry out this noncyclic photophosphorylation. The structure of these 
things, there's an outer membrane. Just similar to what I told you for the 
mitochondria. There's an inner membrane. And what's special about the 
mitochondrion then, there's another membrane inside that's known as the thylocoid. 

And that's where all the chlorophyll is. And the reason the out and the in is a little b it 
confusing in here is this part, which is probably the cytop lasm of the old bacterium, 
is pumped  from what's known as the stroma of a chloroplast which is equiva lent to 

the cytop lasm of the original bacteria into the lumen. So the chlorophyll that's in this 
membrane absorbs the light, pumps protons into the lumen build ing up a proton 
gradient, and then they flow back out in the other d irection and make ATP. 

Here's a picture of a chlorop last once aga in. It looks an awful lot like the bacterium 
still that got captured. All this stuff on the inside, those are the thylocoid membranes 
that carry out this specia lized stuff. So there you have it. That's how cells, the major 
ways that life has figured out how to make energy. When Penny Chisholm starts to 
talk to you she'll ta lk to you about how organisms adapt to various niches, things 
that live in the bottom of the ocean, things that  live in various p laces. 

They a ll have to make energy. Well, they all use some variation on these princip les 
I've ta lked to you about. And she'll then show you how they're very clever at 
extracting energy out of all sorts of things by applying these principles in different 
ways. OK. So what we're going to start doing now is we're going to start ta lking 
about DNA. This is certainly a molecule that's fascinated me all my life. You should 
know  from the first part that it's built up of units known as nucleotides that have a 
sugar. 

It's a ribose sugar that's missing one hydroxyl so it's a deoxyribose. The sugars are 
numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I showed you that. There'll be a phosphate. And then one of 
these nucleic acid bases, either a pyrimidine or a purine. And in DNA you find the 
pyrimidine bases are cytosine and thymine. And in DNA the purine bases are adenine 
and guanine. And then these subunits are polymerized together. 

In essence, splitting out water to give you a polymer. And  I d idn't emphasize this too 
strong the first time I showed it to you. It's going to become a very big deal over the 
next few  lectures as we beg in to consider how nature had to figure out how  to 
replicate DNA and a ll sorts of implications to go along with this, but there's a polarity 
to a strand of DNA. This is what's called the 5 prime sugar. 

The primes ind icate the numbers referring to the sugar, and the ones w ithout primes 
are referring to numbers of atoms that make up part of the nucleic acid base. So if 
we're looking at a cha in, this is a 5 prime carbon of the sugar, that's the 3 prime. 
And so what you can see, this bond which is rea lly a phosphodiester bond, the 
phosphate group has formed an ester w ith this hydroxyl and with the hydroxyl that 
used to be here. 

So it's a phosphod iester bond and it's a 5 prime, 3 prime bond. It joins the 5 prime 
carbon to  the 3 prime carbon up here. So that means  if you're looking at a cha in of 
DNA, if you come down this way you're coming in the 5 to 3 prime direction. If we 
come up the other way we're coming from the 3 prime end heading towards the 5 
prime end. 

So you'll see me saying 5 prime, 3 prime. Now, as I told you, the princip le force that 
holds the strands of the DNA together are hydrogen bonds, three of them between a 
G and a C and two of them between an A and a T. And then they are a pa ir of 
strands. And they're actua lly running in opposite polarities. This is something to 
contend with when we think about rep lication. 5 prime to 3 prime in one direction 
and 5 prime to 3 prime going in the opposite way here. 

And then, as you all know, it's ca lled the doub le helix. So it's actually not flat like this 
in space. It's in a 3-dimensiona l twisted into a double helix and the base pa irs are 

held together by hydrogen bonds between the bases on the opposite strands down 
the midd le of the molecule. And I like this little movie I showed you because you can 
see it pretty well. The nitrogens are b lue. 

It's easy to see the bases. And the hydrogen bonds are right in the midd le. There's 
another force I didn't mention and it doesn't matter for this course, but when the 
bases sort of stack on top of each other there's actually a kind of extra stab ilization 
that comes from that. It's a gorgeous molecule. You all know it encodes the genetic 
information. We're going to be talking about it a lot, but first thing, you know, I 
could just tell you it's the genetic information. 

But one of the really big discoveries in biology was that DNA is the genetic 
information. And a point I'm trying to help you learn here, you know, I'm trying to 
teach you more than just facts. And  I hope some of you at  least w ill catch that. I'm 
trying to show you how biology is done. As an experimental scientist you don't sit 
down usually and  figure it out. Instead you start doing experiments and you get all 
kinds of unexpected discoveries. 

And, in general, as peop le work in these unexpected discoveries ultimately they 
come to these grand new insights that, you know, sometimes would have been very 
hard to  forget. So the rea l question that people wondered for a long time, and we'll 
talk more about the history of genetics, but people knew we clearly had inheritable 
tra its. You could see it in your kids. 

Peop le had been breeding p lants and all sorts of things. Breeding domestic animals. 
They sort of understood the principle of inheritance. When I tell you about Mendel 
we'll beg in to see how his thinking led to the idea that the inheritance wasn't just 
sort of like a liquid where everything mixed together. It came in units or particles 
which we know of as genes. And so the idea of genes had been accepted certainly by 
the beginning of this century anyway, but nobody knew what they were made of. 

They were made of -- The major properties that they had was they clearly encoded 
information in some way. They must replicate because one cell could give two and on 
and on and on. So  if you were going to pass it down in an inherited way they have to 
be replicated. And the third thing was that peop le knew somehow they could mutate 
or the information content that they encoded could be changed. 

Again, you could see that, that you'd get something, an altered characteristic, and 
then it would be propagated down through that line. That was the principle of 
breed ing that people had done for ages. And so they understood that. There was one 
other key thing they knew. They knew that these genes were in the nucleus. And I'll 
tell you the full story of how even that insight was arrived at. 

But I'll just show you for the moment this little movie. This shows some 
chromosomes that are all bunched up and are just pulled apart at the time of the cell 
division. Those chromosomes, as we now know, are made of DNA. But in essence 
what people had seen through the microscope was these chromosomes or colored 
things that they could sta in. 

They could sort of see something had doubled. And just before the cell d ivided the 
two sets separated and each cell got a new set. So that's about what peop le knew. 
They had those properties. They're in the nucleus. They knew about as much as you 
do. They knew the major classes of biomolecules in a cell. So what do you think you 

would need to do to show that DNA is the genetic materia l, encodes the genes? F ind 
somebody near you. 

I'll g ive you a minute or so. I'd like to hear what kind of ideas you come up with. 
Then I'll tell you how it happened. But I want to hear. Why don't you think about it 
and just see if you can come up with a couple ideas for me, what you'd need to 
figure out. Well, let's just see what kind of ideas anybody got. If you wanted to make 
me believe that DNA is doing that, or I think it's a protein  for the moment, that's 
what I think is most likely, but what you do think? Anybody got an idea? Mess up the 
DNA and see if we can mess up the cell. 

How are we going to do that? I can break a cell open and  I guess I can purify DNA 
and I can ana lyze it. And it's got four bases  in it and it's got sugars and phosphates. 
At that point nobody could sequence DNA. We d idn't even know the structure. Yeah? 
Take it out of one cell and put  it into another. And what would you expect to happen 
then? OK. 

That's a rea lly nice idea. Somehow if you took the DNA and moved  it from one cell to 
another that the characteristic of this cell would be somehow carried over. OK. That's 
in fact the way it happened but not as simply as that, as I'll tell you, but that's 
exactly the essence of it. One little problem. Maybe we'll see if anybody has a 
thought on this. If I purify DNA, I mean nothing's ever really pure, right? You get it 
out and there's a lways little bits of stuff. 

And someone can always argue, well, yeah, it's 99% DNA, but it's the other b its you 
cannot get rid of. Yeah? If you used rad ioactive material, how is that going to help 
us? It does conta in nitrogen. Well, it gets a little comp licated. Certainly nucleic acids 
have like phosphate in them, but so does RNA. That's going to be hard. Maybe if I 
had a mixture of things and I wanted to prove whether something was let's say DNA, 
a protein or something, you need some really specific way of saying I d id something 
to the DNA and not to the protein or something like that. 

Have you heard anything in this course that is really specific? Enzymes. Do you think 
that'd give you an idea of how you might do it? If I've got a tube and it's mostly DNA 
and maybe a b it of protein and something, and let's say his idea is working, that we 
can take the DNA  from this cell and put it over into the second cell and see the 
characteristic change, if I wanted to do something to show that it was the DNA in the 
tube that was responsible, could you use an enzyme? And what kind of enzyme 
would you want? Well, what characteristics would you like it to have? Nature's 
probably made it for you a lready. 

Something that synthesizes DNA? Something that breaks down DNA? Say I treated 
this tube with some kind of enzyme and then I wanted to see the outcome, what 
would we want, an enzyme that did what? Anybody else got an idea? You're 
asserting that it's the DNA in my prep, I like your idea, but I need to prove  it so I 
need to do something to show that it's actually the DNA and not the other stuff. 

So if I had an enzyme that did what to DNA? If I broke it down, yeah. We could treat 
it. And  if your idea is right, we treat the stuff w ith something that specifically breaks 
down DNA it won't get transferred. Does that make sense? OK. I mean that's a way 
you could go at a proof of this. And, in  fact, that's what happened. But I'm going to 
quickly tell you how it actually happened. And again, you know, as I say, I'm trying 

to tell you a few things that are besides here are the facts that you need to know on 
exam. 

There's a bigger p icture here and this is how research goes, and particularly in an 
experimental science such as biology. The important early work on this came from a 
guy who was known as Frederick Griffith. He was in London. He was a physician. He 
was working in the 1920s. And he was studying pneumonia. That's an infection of 
the lungs -- -- by bacteria. 

There's more than one kind of bacterium that w ill cause pneumonia, but one of the 
really important ones clinically was streptococcus -- -- pneumonia. So it was a 
bacterium. It was given that name. We all have bacteria on us. I think I told you we 
have about ten to the twelfth on our skin, for example. And if streptococcus is on 
your skin it's not a prob lem, but if it gets into your lungs it's a prob lem. 

And so to live with a ll these bacteria with us our bodies have defenses. So we have 
this immune system, we'll talk about more, and a bunch of defender cells. Things 
that you know as white blood cells are defenders. Let's just see here. I'm going to 
show you this little movie. This is one of your white blood cells, a specia l kind of 
white blood cell. 

That  little thing it's chasing is a bacterium. These round things are red b lood cells. I 
mean doesn't it look like a dog going after a mouse, or a cat going after something? 
It's chasing it. It can tell it's there. This is remarkable. And it's a little pixilated, but 
this is real. It's going to catch it right about there. And it eats it. I mean we have 
these cells inside us. That's why you don't d ie even though we live in a world that's 
surrounded by bacteria. 

OK, so we'll go on. So getting pneumonia in those days was a really bad thing. You 
get infected, you get this  in your lungs, and then you have four to six days of high 
fever, and then the patient would reach what's termed as a "crisis". And one of two 
things would happen. They'd either live or they'd die. And that was it. I mean this 
was no fun if somebody you knew had it because you d idn't know the outcome. 

And the outcome wasn't necessarily very good. Now you call up the doctor and they 
pump you full of antibiotics, but antibiotics hadn't been discovered yet. So this was 
pretty serious business, and peop le were trying  to understand what was happening. 
But what was going on during these four to six days that then led to one of these 
two outcomes? Well, it turns out that streptococcus is a bacteria like this. 

So that's the bacterium. And it has around it something known as a capsule. And 
that capsule is polysaccharide. Remember back to the second lecture when I was 
confusing you a ll by showing you how sugars could hook together in all a manner of 
different ways? Well, that's what polysaccharides are. You just hook a bunch of 
sugars together. And for this course you don't have to remember the linkages in 
particular. 

You just have to understand that there are different kinds of linkages, and every 
time you hook at  it in a different way you get a different kind of polysaccharide out 
of it. But anyway, the bacterium make this capsule of polysaccharide. And it's full of 
hydroxyl groups from all those sugars so it attracts a  lot of water around it. And 
what it does is it causes a prob lem for those defender cells that we just saw. 

Those would be, for examp le, a macrophagic kind of white blood cell. And it cannot 
eat something that's got the capsule. Now, here's a picture of one of these capsules 
on one of these kinds of bacteria. You can sort of see it out here. It's polysaccharide. 
That's the main part of the bacterium. And here's another pixilated thing of one of 
these white blood cells eating a bacterium that doesn't have a capsule. 

But watch what happens if the bacterium has a capsule. It cannot get a hold of it. It 
just cannot quite grab hold of it. So what happened during those days, though, was 
this capsule which is a foreign entity to your body gets recognized in your immune 
system. And your immune system made antibod ies that could  recognize that. We'll 
talk about what these are, but all you need to know for the moment is that they're 
proteins and they can be tuned to recognize some chemical entity w ith a very, very 
high degree of specificity. 

So what the body was doing during this thing was trying to make antibodies that 
would help it recognize this capsule. And then it decorates the capsule w ith these 
things. And once it puts antibod ies stuck a ll over the surface now it can get a hold of 
it. And, aga in, a fact you don't have to know. This whole process is called 
opsonization. The reason they use the word opsin because opsin is the Greek word 
for seasoning. 

And it was as if these white blood cells liked to have their bacteria seasoned correctly 
before they can eat them. And what's really going on is that they're decorating them 
with antibod ies. So what was going on after a person got sick, it was a  race between 
their immune system trying to make antibod ies which would let their immune system 
suppress the infection and the bacterium which is replicating unchecked for the first 
few days. 

And that's why it was such a scary business, because you didn't know what the 
outcome was and things could tip it one way or the other. Well, this did suggest a 
kind of therapy. The kind of therapy would be to isolate a capsule to inject a horse. 
Get the antibodies from the horse. Why a horse? A horse  is huge, right? It makes a 
lot of antibodies. A lot better than  injecting a mouse if you want to get antibodies. 

So get antibodies and then inject the patient. It's a good idea in princip le. So you're 
sort of short-circuiting this whole process. The problem was there were more than 20 
kinds of capsules. And so what people had to do was they had to isolate the 
bacterium -- -- from the patient, determine the type of capsule. Let's say it's sort of 
from capsule 1 up to capsule type 20, which one it was, and then inject the correct 
antibody. 

So this was nerve-racking because it took a while for the bacteria to grow so it was a 
pretty tight time window. And if you saw the patient right away that's good, but  if 
they were partway down the infection not so good. So the one other thing to do this, 
they didn't bother a ll the way to isolate the capsule. What they would usua lly do is 
use heat-killed bacteria and then you'd have the capsule and everything. 

The bacterium is dead, it cannot do anything, and they'd inject the horse w ith that. 
And that would get you the antibodies w ith the capsule. So what Griffith was doing 
was he was fiddling around w ith this system. And there was one other d iscovery that 
he made. Perhaps it wouldn't surprise you that since the bacteria surrounded by a 
molecule absorbs water that the capsules would look sort of g listening. 

They absorbed a lot of water. You can see how they look here. So what they 
discovered was if they have a capsule you get what are ca lled smooth colonies. And 
the word colony in this thing just refers to it started out as one bacterium and it kept 
divid ing and divid ing and dividing. And maybe there are ten to the eighth or ten to 
the ninth bacteria in that little colony. But you can see it. 

They've all got capsules on the outside so it attracts a lot of water and it looks wet. 
And those are what you saw. But what they found is if you waited or grew the 
cultures up that you would see some things that looked dry or they ca lled them 
rough. And these turned out to be bacteria that lacked a capsule. And so if you might 
start w ith a smooth strain S here and then isolate from it a rough strain it might 
designate  it in that kind of way. 

So this is the sort of thing that Griffith was fooling around w ith. So he started with 
doing this kind of experiment. He took a smooth strain making a capsule type two, 
OK? So he was injecting a mouse w ith this. And what happened was the mouse was 
dead. This was a virulent form of the bacterium. So if he took the rough mutant, 
injected the mouse, the mouse is alive and you saw why. If it doesn't have a 
capsule, the mouse has defender cells and white blood cells could eat it. 

Then he had heat-killed S3. So this was a stra in of streptococcus that had a d ifferent 
capsule, a type 3 capsule, but it was heat-killed. Why was he working w ith heat-
killed stuff? Because that's what you injected the horses with to get it. So what do 
you think would happen here? Since the bacteria are dead, probably not a big 
surprise the mouse is alive. 

Now, I don't know whether he did this on purpose or he did it as a control, but what 
he did was he  injected at the same time then R2 plus heat-killed S3. So he's got two 
things that don't do anything, he injects a mouse, and uh-oh, the mouse d ies. That 
is a weird result. That is actually a lso, though, the first really key step to 
understanding that DNA is a genetic material. It doesn't look like it at this point 
probably, but it was. 

This is how we learned this really enormous fact from these experiments. He wasn't 
trying to figure it out. He was trying to work out something else, as you can see, but 
it was a bizarre find ing. So what would you think? I've put in something that used to 
have a R2 capsule. So d id it get rejuvenated somehow by this heat-killed thing or, as 
you'd suggested, did some characteristic get transferred from here or whatever? So 
he isolated the bacteria out of this, and what he found now was he had a live 
bacterium that was making S3. 

So something had been transferred from  this set of dead bacteria into bacteria that 
were a live, and the characteristic had been passed from the dead bacterium to the 
new bacterium, the other bacterium. So this is about what Griffith did, but this 
problem was picked up by a scientist at Rockefeller, Oswa ld Avery who worked as 
part of a team. And he took this find ing and started to work on it and tried to figure 
out, because he saw in this result a way of find ing out what was the genetic materia l 
because somehow what was in that heat-killed S3 was the stuff that would transfer 
genetic information into another bacterium. 

So he made one really big discovery. And that was you d idn't need the mouse at all. 
All that was happening was the mouse, by dying, was in essence selecting for 
smooth bacteria. So he could simp lify things by just taking a rough bacteria, taking 

the heat-killed extract, putting it in, and now he'd just  look for smooth colonies. 
Didn't need any mice at all. So he was able to see the characteristic of the capsule 
being transferred  from some kind of heat-killed mess of things into a rough 
bacterium and changing it into a live bacterium. 

So he started  fractionating, and he d id exactly the kind of approach that you 
suggested. And he purified and he purified and he purified using as his assay this 
ability to pass on this smooth characteristic. And what he ended up with was virtually 
pure DNA but, as I said, you know, a lways never quite pure. And somebody can 
always argue, well, you've got a little bit of something else in there. 

So he d id a  really key experiment and he treated with DNase, your experiment. And 
it lost the transforming activity. So this process of doing this was called 
transformation. Initially it described that phenomenon. Now that we know what 
matters in the thing was taking DNA and putting it  in. So  if you do a UROP 
somewhere here, you clone a p iece of DNA into a plasma and you stick it into E. coli 
so you can grow  it up, that process of taking the naked DNA and putting it inside the 
bacteria, you'll call it transformation. 

Now, in fact, this result wasn't accepted right away. This was pub lished in 1944. And 
the general realization that DNA was the genetic material rea lly didn't come until the 
`50s. Yet this result proved it, if you will, but part of the problem was the world 
wasn't yet ready to accept that DNA was a genetic materia l. And maybe you can see 
the prob lem. It looked like a monotonous molecule. 

It only had  four things that were different  in it. And if you  isolated they were all often 
kind of there and about the same amount. People thought it was just an ana lyst 
GATC. It didn't sound like anything had encoded information. Proteins looked rea lly 
attractive. Twenty d ifferent amino acids that a ll had different characteristics, so that 
was a great place for storing information. So the world wasn't quite ready to accept 
it, even though the experimenta l evidence was there. 

And so the result came later. Now, the last thing I just want to show you, because 
there's a kind of direct link from that Avery experiment to you guys because a year 
or two ago it was the 50th anniversary of the discovery of DNA. And Avery worked 
with a team of two other peop le called MacLeod and McCarty. This was at the 50th 
anniversary, the meeting down at Cold Spring Harbor celebrating it. 

McCarty was the only member of the team alive. There he was. I asked him to 
autograph my program. There was his signature. He just died a little while ago, and 
so there's no living connection to that anymore, but I have a picture to show you 
guys that takes you back from that experiment to his signature right there. OK? So 
I'll tell you some more stuff next lecture.
