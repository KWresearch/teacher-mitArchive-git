Consumptive competition occurs when organisms compete for the same resources. 
These trees are competing for nitrogen and other nutrients.

Preemptive competition occurs when individuals occupy space and prevent access 
to resources by other individuals. The space preempted by these barnacles is 
unavailable to competitors.

Overgrowth competition occurs when an organism grows over another, blocking 
access to resources. This large fern has overgrown other individuals and is 
shading them.

Chemical competition occurs when one species produces toxins that negatively 
affect another. Note how  few  plants are grow ing under these Salvia shrubs.

Territorial competition occurs when mobile organisms protect a feeding or 
breeding territory. These red-w inged blackbirds are displaying to each other 
at a territorial boundary.

Encounter competition occurs when organisms interfere directly w ith each other’s 
access to specific resources. Here, spotted hyenas and vultures fight over a kill.

Mutualism
Mutualism


•	

•	 Mutualism is a type of interaction that is 
beneficial to both species involved. 
It does not involve altruism. The benefits are 
a by-product of each species’ own self-
interest. 
•	 The costs and benefits of mutualism vary 
widely between partners, over time, and from 
one area to the next.
