Transcript â€“ Lecture 26 

So I just want to back up a couple because I think there's still some confusion about 
what a restriction enzyme is and exactly what it does, although I ind icated, a three 
prime hydroxyl and a five-prime phosphate. Let me show you. This is the way a  lot, 
at least a large class of restriction enzymes, went. We've seen a deoxyribose 
backbone before w ith a phosphate backbone going on up to the next nucleotide. This 
is the five-prime position. 

This is the three prime position. There is a phosphate here. It goes down to the next 
one. It goes down like this. So what I'm showing you, GAATTC, five prime to three 
prime, here's where I ind icated the first cut comes from. And I indicated that the 
cleavage generates a G w ith a three prime hydroxyl, and the G ends up with a  five 
prime phosphate. So what that means is that the hydrolysis happens right there, so 
that after cleavage, what you end up with is a  five-prime phosphate and three prime 
hydroxyl. This is pa ired with the C on the opposite strand. It makes one cut here, 
and then it would make an identical cut on the opposite strand. So if we were to pull 
those apart this strand here would have G w ith  its three prime OH, and the other 
strand would be TTAA. And if we were to pull the apart. 

We'd have A A T T C, a three prime OH here,  five prime phosphate there,  five prime 
phosphate there. Again, you have to remember, this strand  is going five prime, three 
prime in that d irection. This was going five prime, three prime in the end. And the 
beauty of these restriction enzymes, at least it's not true of all of them. But it's true 
of a lot of them as they generate these what are ca lled sticky ends. You can pull 
them apart. They come back together, though, and reform those base pairs. It's 
almost like having little bits of Velcro at the end. And when this end is looking for a 
complementary sequence to pa ir w ith. 

It doesn't know what's out here, and it doesn't know what's out there, all it sees as 
this. So I can cut this and rejoin it or I can cut them and pull apart, take another 
piece of DNA that's been cut with the same enzyme and therefore has the same 
corresponding little sticky ends on each end, and it could insert right in the middle. 
And that's the principle of cloning. And it was the development of these, if you w ill, 
magic scissors that made it possib le to take this DNA which looks so homogeneous, 
nothing but GA's, T's, and C's, and then cut it up in defined ways. 

When I was a postdoc, a friend of mine had just purified $2 million worth of EcoRI 
because he purified some of this enzyme. At that point, the only way to get these 
things was to produce them yourself and purify them. Now  there are litera lly 
hundreds of these and they recognize different sequences, and once peop le 
understood that they existed, then they just started to look in different, usually 
they're from bacteria, and they just looked in d ifferent bacteria until they found 
another one. And then they purified it. So if you go to, say, any of the companies 
that do stuff for recombinant DNA, you'll find lists like this. Funny little abbreviations 
like EcoRI usually have something that tells you some abbreviation related to the 
organism,  from which the restriction enzyme was isolated. 

And you can  find things that will cut, I won't say every sequence, but very, very, 
many sequences. There are literally hundreds of these, and you just order them. And 
the next day, a FedEx package arrives w ith a little bit of the enzyme that will cut at 
that sequence. Another concept that seemed to be a problem, was what's a vector? 
So if you understand that there are sequence specific molecular scissors, that if we 
have a p iece of DNA and there's an EcoRI site here, you would come to think of it 
like that because it's going to cut in a slightly skewed way. 

Maybe there's another one right here, another one over here. If we take this DNA 
and cut  it with this particular enzyme, we get a break here. Then this will get this 
piece running from here to here. We'll get this little piece here. We'll get this piece 
here, and will get whatever goes off on those sides. So that's naked DNA in a test 
tube. So I could cut any p iece of DNA at some sites generating a bunch of fragments 
and if I just took those fragments and transformed them into E. 

coli, I took naked DNA,  took it from the outside, put it inside, is it going to replicate? 
No. Why not? Because there's a specia l signal called the origin of replication that 
says "start rep licating DNA here". This came from a piece of human, lets say some of 
my DNA, it would not have a signal in it that said to the E. coli rep lication machinery, 
"start replicating DNA right here". So the princip le of, apart from being able to cut 
DNA fragments, is you have together to replicate so you can make lots of lots of 
copies. The trick is to attach the DNA, at least a widely used trick is to attach the 
DNA to something that has an orig in of replication that w ill work in the organism in 
question. 

And that was what we call a vector. So this is an E. coli cell. Another thing that's 
very confusing is all the circles that show up in this course. This is huge. The vector 
was double-stranded DNA that maybe, let's say, had a unique EcoRI restriction site 
in it. That's the only EcoRI restriction site. The other thing that we'd need to have is 
an origin of DNA rep lication. So, that's why this plasmid is ab le to propagate itself. 
This little circle of DNA is able to propagate itself, and then some kind of selectable 
marker. And, most of the time that's a drug-resistance, so a lthough it doesn't have 
to be. And if we cut that here, generate sticky ends, then we can take this fragment 
and stick it in here, to g ive this p iece here joined to the vector. 

And that's an insert. Let's say it was that p iece there. In  fact, if you wanted to clone 
DNA in E. coli, and then have the plasmid work  in yeast, if you just take that plasmid 
that works, the vector with its insert that works  in E. coli and put it in the yeast, it 
won't replicate either. And that's because these other languages other than the 
genetic code are not universal. So, you a lso have to put a lso in a sequence that sa id 
to the yeast rep lication machinery "start something here". Peop le call that a shuttle 
vector, something that will rep licate in E. coli or replicate in yeast, and the same 
principle applies to other organisms Okay, now probably the trickiest thing, the thing 
where I sort of muddled it on Friday, and I apologize for that, was this d iscovery of 
restriction enzymes. 

And aga in, some of you were frustrated. You said, why do I waste time? Why not 
just tell you stuff that's on the exam? Okay again, peop le were talking about 
molecular scissors when I was an undergrad and grad student, and chemists were 
trying to think if they could come up with some way to get some specificity  in how to 
cutting DNA. And the answer,  the d iscovery of restriction enzymes d idn't come from 
that kind of experiment. 

It came from somebody trying to understand what seemed to be a  rea lly obscure 
piece of biology. Julie made up a lovely little slide. But I think it basically d id was I 
left at one of the little layers that I usua lly show. So, let me just talk. Here's, again, 
what Luria saw when he was doing these experiments. So, I'm going to tell you now 
what was in stra in A and B, and maybe that will help. But I wanted you first to see it 
without know ing what anything beyond what Luria knew. OK, strain A has no 
restriction enzyme, and no modification enzyme. And a lthough there are d ifferent 
types of modification enzymes, many of them are methylases. 

So, we'll call that. And this one has a  restriction enzyme. And, it has correspond ing 
methylase. Just to review that again, if you can  figure this pretty much out from  first 
principles that  if you were an organism, and you had a restriction enzyme that would 
cut this, there are two things you can possibly do to keep from cutting up your own 
DNA. One is to never have that sequence of pure DNA. 

That would prevent you from cutting up your own DNA, even though it has it. It's 
pretty constraining now, because somewhere in a particular protein, you might need 
that little b it of sequence to encode something that you need to make a critica l 
protein. So instead what you  find is organisms have a  restriction enzyme, have those 
sequences, but they don't cut up their own DNA because they modify their own DNA, 
by putting, in the case of this one, they put a methyl here. And I drew that out the 
other day. 

You can see, you can put a methyl group on the exocyclic amino group of adanine, 
and not interfere w ith base pa iring. But what you can do, is interfere w ith the way 
that the restriction enzymes sees that sequence. And when the cell pulls the DNA 
apart, each of the old strands is methylated, and a new strand  is initially not 
methylated. But that's enough keep the restriction enzyme from doing its thing. And 
then the methylase w ill come a long,  find a sequence, and then the progeny strand, 
the daughter strand, will beg in to get methylated. 

So, once you get DNA methylated, you can propagate it as long as you have the 
methyl group. So this was what was really underlying what Luria d id. But he d idn't 
know that. Let me quickly just go through this again. So he grew  the stra in, the 
phage on strain A, no restriction enzyme, just plain old DNA. So, he picks a p laque 
that's probably about a billion phage in a plaque, somewhere around 10^8, 10^9 
probably, no  that's not true, a little less than that, somewhat  less than that, but lots 
and lots of phage particles in the p laque. Resuspend them and then p late them out. 
And of course it grew on stra in A. 

That's what it was growing on. That wouldn't surprise you at a ll. The surprise was, 
even though he knew he had lots and lots of phage, hardly any of them grew on 
strain B. But, he found a rare plaque that had learned to grow. And he tested then, 
and this thing grows on stra in B. That was not a surprise because it had to grow on 
strain B to be up there. And he tested, and it still grew on the strain A. So up until 
now, everything we knew, everything we've ta lked about  in that course, you think, 
ah-ha, this origina l phage couldn't grow on stra in B, but it's mutated. 

Somehow. It's  learned to grow on stra in B. That would be a perfectly reasonab le 
exp lanation. But if that were the case, what would've happened? Well it was growing 
on those phage, you p ick them again,  it should still grow on A and B, and they still 
do. The problem with that model was that they grew on strain A. They had troub le 
grow ing on strain B. Now that we've learned to grow on strain B, but you hadn't 

forgotten how to grow on stra in A. But if you take the ones that were grow ing on 
strain A, they grow on strain A, not a surprise. This  is the prob lem right here. 

If this was a mutant, permanent change,  then we should have been ab le to have it 
grow on strain B as well. So what was really happening in there? Well, at the 
beginning, the phage DNA was lacking any kind of mod ification. It grew fine on strain 
A, because there was no restriction enzyme. When it went into strain B, that now 
had an enzyme, a restriction enzyme that cut up any time  it found that sequence. 
And so, most of the phage that injected their DNA, those DNAs were trashed by the 
restriction enzyme. 

But there is a methylase in there that's also able to methylate those sequences. And 
what happened somewhere a long the way was that there was the methyl, on one 
phage DNA, and got enough methyls on there that the phage could be rep licated 
before it got cut up by the restriction enzyme. Once the phage molecule has 
methylations on the site, it's ab le to grow just fine on strain B, and it w ill be able to 
do that forever. However, if you take that DNA with the methyls on it, and we put it 
back strain A, it'll still grow, as this one doesn't have any kind of restriction enzyme, 
but while it's growing its busy losing a ll the methyls again. 

We are right back to where we started from. An obscure experiment, one of the most 
obscure you could get, many people would have paid no attention. It does not seem 
worth it. So, the phenomenon was called restriction. 

They had to g ive it a name. It wasn't mutation. They said this phage DNA was being 
restricted somehow when it grew on stra in B. People called them, postulated there 
must be a  restriction enzyme that was doing this restricting of phage growth. When 
they found out what was doing it, they had discovered mag ic scissors that would cut 
DNA at particular sequences. So, the point here again, to try and go back and do 
this, I hope some of you will get this anyway, many of the rea lly important 
discoveries come out of basic research. 

They are easy to ridicule. Why would I spend money on cancer, human disease or 
something, for somebody studying some little weird phenomenon about phage. But if 
you want to trace back to the experiment, it sort of started the biotech industry. It 
was the discovery of restriction enzymes. It took a little while to discover what it 
was, but the reason they were discovered, were people were trying to understand 
that phenomenology. Once we got restriction enzymes, we already had ligase, which 
is sort of the tape we'd need, and just to show you here, when we go back to this 
one, you can see that if we put these together again, we have a three prime 
hydroxyl, and a five-prime phosphate. 

That's what DNA ligase knows how to do, because that's how you seal up the end of 
a Okazaki fragment. So, that particular part of the molecular biology toolkit was 
already known to molecular biolog ists who had been studying DNA replication. OK, 
so, if we took some DNA from anything, and we cut up  into p ieces like this, and then 
we join them w ith a vector that had been cut, so let's just sort of open  it up a little 
bit, this fragment would go in here into one vector molecule. 

This fragment would insert in another vector molecule, and so on and so  forth. Then 
we would have what I sa id was a library, and the prob lem at this point is, so you 
transform those into E. coli, and now we have a whole series of E. coli. They have 

their own chromosome, every one of them because they still have to be a bacterium. 
So, let's take three members of E. 

coli from this library, and they will all have this vector, but they'll have, let's say, 
insert number 1, 2, 3. This insert is a little. This insert is bigger, and so on. If we did 
it right. We have every possible fragment of DNA from the original source sitting in 
its own vector. And the whole collection of E. coli in this population in the certain 
library, and the next part of the trick was, how do you find the thing you want, 
especia lly if you take my DNA w ith 3 b illion base pairs. That's an aw ful lot of 
restriction fragments no matter what you do. 

How do you go about doing it? So the experiment that I showed you at the end of 
the lecture, cloning by comp lementation, is fa irly simple, and it was basically one of 
the first methods that was used to find genes  in recombinant library. And that would 
be, for example, something that had thisGene mutation in the chromosomal DNA. 
This is what the situation I'd described the other day. 

So, if we put the library into every cell, such that the bacterium we transformed the 
library into was broken for the hisG gene, and that mutant couldn't grow on minimal 
med ium unless we put in added histadine. But, if one member of that library had the 
wild type, hisG gene, let's say it was this one here, maybe it had severa l genes on it. 
But let's say over here. 

We had hisG+, then the stra in is back to being able to synthesize histid ine because 
it's got all the enzymes. What I was pointing out was this rea lly is complementation, 
just like we did in that phage cross. We've got one broken copy of the gene. We've 
got a good copy. And all you need is one good copy, and you're back in business. 
What I was saying at the end of the lecture was this is not a genera l solution, 
though. If I wanted to find the correspond ing histidine gene from my DNA, and all of 
these biosynthetic pathways, pretty much they rose so early in evolution, the 
biochemistry is essentially identica l in all cells. Can I use this approach to find the 
same gene for my DNA? What do you think? Why don't you  turn to somebody beside 
you and see if you can talk for a minute, and then let's see if, I can think of at least 
a couple of prob lems. 

Let's see if you can come up w ith one or two of them. Find somebody near you and 
see if you can come up w ith anything. Anybody want to volunteer? An idea of why it 
would not work? Or some of you think it would? No ideas? God, it's Monday. 
[LAUGHTER] I feel like most of you guys. Somebody, come on. 

What do you think? It's going to work? No idea? What has to happen for it to work? 
I'll g ive you a vector that has my gene corresponding to that enzyme. It's in E. coli. I 
need to make the protein. Yeah? No,  it's in the vector. We cloned it into an E. coli 
vector. So, that's got  it. Yeah? Well it'll have a language that w ill say "start 
transcription", but whose language is it going to have? It's going to have my 
transcriptional stuff. Will that work in E. coli? Even though the open read ing frame is 
fine, that's good. How about translation? I didn't even tell you about that. There is 
actually some specific stuff needed. 

That's not universal, either. So when you get the RNA you still have to translate it. 
There  is another thing that might mess us up. Do you remember anything else 
about, yeah? Introns and exons? What if my gene has introns in it, which it almost 
surely has? We have to get rid of those. E. coli doesn't know what they are. It's not 

used to taking them out. You see the  issues? Although that's a cute thing and that 
helps you  find a gene from E. coli by comp lementing E. coli mutant, or maybe you 
could do it with yeast if you had a factor that would replicate in yeast, it wasn't a 
general solution. So peop le had to use a whole variety of d ifferent ways. 

Here's another way. You know that you have that genetic code. That was worked out 
years ago. So  let's say I was a biochemist, and  I'd found a protein that I was 
interested in, and I purified it, and they got it out to single protein, and then I could 
cut  it up with things that proteases that w ill cut the protein into pieces, and there are 
ways of sequencing protein. I'm not going to tell you how it works in this course. 

We just don't have time. But you can get the sequence of little pieces of protein. And 
let's imag ine that this was the sequence of part of the protein that I purified. It's one 
of my enzymes [SOUND OFF/THEN ON] and I'd like to  find the gene. Well, how could 
I use that information to  figure out where the gene is in this library? So here's the 
strategy. We get out the genetic code, which Gobind Khorana and Marshall N irenberg 
helped work out, and we say OK, a lanine, and if you look it up, what you'll find  is 
that it's GC, and then it can be A T C or G. It can be any of those. If we look up what 
the codon for aspartate. 

We'll find that there's a G or an A, but it could be T, or it could be C. We look up 
lysine; it'll mostly be A, but it could be A or G. You'll notice the variation of those 
things is almost all in the third codon if that hadn't struck you. Same thing with 
threonine: A, C, and this is another one; therefore codons that encode this. And this 
one asparagine is that. So know ing that piece of the protein doesn't define a unique 
sequence. 

Though, what we could do it is we could synthesize what's called a mixed probe. And 
that would mean when we are going to synthesize this DNA and we'd start with a G 
build ing block. And then we'd add a C build ing b lock. So, now we made G and C. And 
at the next step, we'd add an equa l mixture of A, T, G, and C. So, what we would get 
out of that would be we'd be getting G, and then the next b iosynthetic step would 
give us G, C. And then the next b iochemical step would g ive us GCA, GCT, GCC, or 
GCG. At the next step, we'd add a G. 

So everyone of these would get a G. Everyone would get an A, and then the next 
step, they would branch. And if you follow that out, you'll see by the end you have a 
mixture of probes. One of them is going to be the right one that you  find in the DNA. 
Now if you work out the number of possib ilities, you'll discover that most of the time 
there is only going to be one probe that's unique. Once you get to about 20 
nucleotides, any sequence, on average, is represented once in the human genome. 
So as long as you make the probe  long enough, one of the things in your mixture will 
be a defined probe. So, what we can take is we have all these different p ieces of 
DNA that are the log ical variants you can see here. And then we would label the 
probe with P32. 

It's a radioactive isotope, and it's very easy. You can add it to a five-prime 
phosphate. There's a special enzyme that will very easily take the terminal 
phosphate from ATP and put it over. It doesn't really [SOUND OFF/THEN ON] for this 
course how we get  it there. But we can do is rad ioactively label the probe. So now 
we've got this mixture. And, somewhere in this library is a piece of DNA that's going 
to have the gene that's encoding the protein that we're interested in. So, how do you 
go about trying to deal w ith that? So, what we'll do is we'll plate our E. coli library 

onto a bunch of Petri plates. So, I won't put too many colonies on here, so we can 
sort of see a pattern. 

But, we'd have probab ly a lot of them, and we'd have a bunch of plates. You can 
work out statistica lly how many p lates you have to have to have a chance of finding 
your gene of interest. Then what we do, is lay a membrane on the plate. It's a 
particular type of membrane, and what that will do is it w ill make a copy of 
everything that's there, and we're going to save the plate. And then we're going to 
treat the membrane, OK? We've got a membrane that's got an identical pattern. 
They've got some of the bacteria from the colonies stuck at the corresponding parts 
on the membrane. 

We're going to lyse the E. coli; that means break them open so all their insides spill 
out. We will denature the DNA by treating with a condition. You can, for example, 
vary the pH and make the strands come apart. That g ives single stranded DNA, "ss" 
I'm using as an abbreviation for sing le strand of the strands you pulled apart. And, 
this sticks to the membrane. So, now we've got, at every one of these little positions 
on the membrane something that looks like this. Here's the membrane, and there's 
some sort of single stranded DNA that's stuck to the membrane in that fashion. 

The DNA that's stuck here came from  the bacterium here that had a particular insert. 
Over here, we have a ll the E. coli DNA and the vector DNA, but we w ill have a 
different piece of DNA in the vector. Everybody with me? OK, so if we were now to 
take our rad ioactive probe that we made up there and get the conditions just right, 
that sing le stranded probe w ill come in, and it w ill try and find its comp lement. It'll 
form hydrogen bonds because that's the lowest energy well. And, we think about it 
thermodynamically. And, if we can get it right, the temperature and the conditions 
right, nothing will stick unless it's an exact match to the sequence. And, if we get the 
right probe that can form hydrogen bonds w ith everything on here, and it's got P32 
at this point, what will happen is we'll have now, the probe w ill stick, say, to this 
particular colony, now with rad ioactivity right there. 

So, put some photographic film over the membrane, and  right here there's P32, and 
that'll expose the film and nowhere else. And then, when we develop, what we'll find 
is one, if this works well, anyway, one spot. So, now we know that that piece, that 
colony had a piece of human DNA in  it that was related to the sequence from the 
protein that I had purified. 

So we go back to this colony, I think our things have probably migrated around a 
little bit here. Let's move this up just a little bit, and make it a little better. So this 
one  is this one. So, now I can go back to this colony and pick it out. And, let's say 
it's this insert. So, now I've found I can sequence the rest of that piece of DNA. We'll 
talk about how we sequence DNA in the next lecture. So that's an a lternative way of 
identifying a clone of interest. There was a particularly painful way of find ing a gene 
in a  library that we for the most part do not have to do any more. It was ca lled 
positional cloning. 

And for example the gene that when it's broken causes cystic fibrosis, it's a very 
difficult disease. Humans who have cystic fibrosis have a very tough time. So there's 
a great dea l of interest  in finding the gene that was broken in these patients. Human 
geneticists, I showed you something about pedigrees, they would have a 
chromosome. They might have band ing patterns, and they would have figured out 
that somewhere along the chromosome that the gene for cystic fibrosis lay 

somewhere between two genetic markers that they had identified. Now, the amount 
of DNA between something that you knew that the gene was here, and something 
knew that the gene was there, could be huge. 

It could be many, many, many times the size of the E. coli chromosome. So, what 
people would do is they'd clone something from here, a little piece of DNA from 
there, and also clone something and they get a little p iece of DNA from there. And 
then they go into the library, and they try and  find something that had this DNA and 
something that extended in this direction the little bit. By the sort of thing you'd 
have marker A somewhere in the midd le of the cystic fibrosis gene but you didn't 
know exactly where. You'd clone a little piece of DNA and use that to find another 
one that overlapped w ith it. And that you'd find, use that to find another p iece of 
DNA. 

You'd wa lk your way over this way, and you'd start the same process at the other 
end. And, every one of these things, the same kind of operation that we've got here, 
so cycles, and cycles, and cycles of acquiring the next ad jacent piece of DNA, and 
working your way a long here. And you had to use more than one d ifferent restriction 
enzymes, otherw ise you wouldn't be able to get these overlaps. And by doing that, 
eventua lly they were able to get all the DNA that was between these markers. 

They knew the cystic fibrosis gene was there from the maps they had made by 
studying human pedigrees. And then, once you knew the sequence, then you'd take 
candidate genes, and you'd take a bunch of cystic fibrosis patients, and you'd start 
to see if every person who had cystic fibrosis had a mutation in that gene. And, 
eventua lly they got it. 

That process in the case of cystic fibrosis took five years to do that with a huge team 
of people. And, I guess it was from 1985-1990. If you wanted  to do that experiment 
today. We come now to one of the most w idely used ways to  find ing a gene of 
interest, and that is you go to the computer. The whole human genome sequence is 
in there. If we were to do that experiment today, we'd say, well, I know what this 
gene is, so you  look that gene up in the database. And you knew what this gene was 
and you look up the database. Then you just look at a ll the DNA that's in the middle. 
And you'd see a whole series of open reading frames. And you'd probab ly say, well, 
what do I know about the biology of cystic fibrosis? Could  I make a guess? Is it a 
membrane protein? Is it not a membrane protein? And, there are certa in 
characteristics that would probab ly allow you to make a guess. 

And then, you could jump right in and start sequencing DNA. You could start the 
experiment practica lly that afternoon instead of five years later. So, if you look back 
from the  literature, you'll find some of the key genes; in fact, in human biology, 
we're isolated by this very pa inful process of positional cloning, and you hard ly ever 
have to do that now. It may be the odd case where something's needed, but most of 
the stuff now, there are these amazing databases, and I'll give you the URL for it at 
the beginning of next lecture. And I'll show you when, this is an experiment in which 
someone took this gene for cystic fibrosis. 

It is a membrane protein, and it's one of those proteins that mediates the passage of 
chloride ions across the membrane. And,  if that gets broken, you end up with cystic 
fibrosis. What someone has done here is they've taken that green fluorescent protein 
gene. And, they've fused it to the end of the cystic fibrosis gene. So, you can tell 
where the cystic fibrosis gene is loca lized in a lung cell by looking to see where the 

fluorescence  is. And, I think you can see that the fluorescence is out there along the 
membrane. OK, so at the beginning of next lecture, I'll introduce you to how we take 
one of these recombinant plasmids, and make what's called a  restriction map. 

It's using a very simple, little p iece of apparatus like that, and we'll go  in and tell you 
about DNA sequencing, and this PCR technique you've heard, preliminary cha in 
reaction that you've heard so much about, OK?
