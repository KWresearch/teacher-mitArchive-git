<p></p>
<p>What we've talked about in recombinant DNA so far is how to get a  piece of DNA from somewhere and make a whole lot of copies of it. So,  instead of working with DNA extracted from my cells, which there's 3  billion different base pairs of sequence, we can find a little stretch  of DNA. But simply being able to clone it, it was a long way from being  able to get a lot of a fragment of DNA to be able to figure out what  that sequence is.</p>
<p>That sequence of that gene is actually from the  xeroderma gene, the gene that's broken in the xeroderma pigmentosum  variant patient, missing one of these translesion DNA polymerases that  can copy over a thymine-thymine, pyrimidine dimmer induced by UV light.  So the reason they have that problem with their skin after sunlight is  because they are missing a polymerase that can't copy over accurately  over this very common lesion caused by DNA damage.</p>
<p>But how do you  get from having a piece of DNA and having the sequence? So, the first  thing that people learn to do, and you still do this all the time in any  molecular biology lab. We're sort of switching now in engineering as  you'll see. You're going to see in the next things that I'm going to  say, proteins that were, I talked to you about because of their  biological roles.</p>
<p>DNA polymerase is, ligases, we learned what they  do. And now you're going to see them used in manipulative ways.  Restriction enzymes: they have a biological purpose, too. They weren't  put on Earth for me to cut up DNA into fragments and clone. They were  there to give the bacteria some kind of primitive immune system. But the  first thing that you often have to do, and you have, let's say, a  plasmid into which we've inserted a fragment.</p>
<p>And let's say it was  the kind of cloning we described the other day, where I had cut to the  vector with an EcoRI site, and the other DNA with an EcoRI site. So  these, the junction between the inserted fragment and the cut vector has  re-created two EcoRI sites now. And if I cut with EcoRI, I'll just undo  what I did in the cloning, and we should get the vector DNA and the  insert DNA back again.</p>
<p>So, I can go from this vector to give us an  orientation. I'm going to imagine that it has one more restriction  site. This one is called SalI. It just recognizes a different sequence.  So, if I take the plasmid DNA and cut with EcoRI, I'm just reversing the  cloning. So I should get the vector DNA and the insert that I generated  in the first place.</p>
<p>But I have to detect them somehow.  Unfortunately, they don't just look in the test tube like that. So, what  people do is they use a very simple principle. It's called gel  electrophoresis. And the idea is you just make a gel of something. In  this particular case, it's just made of agar, which is agarose. These  are polysaccharide products, often derived from seaweed or something  like that. They have the property that if you warm them up, they're  liquid, and that if you let them cool down, they're a gel.</p>
<p>You've  run into Jell-O which has that property. That's actually made of a  protein rather than a carbohydrate. But it's that kind of principle. So  it's very easy to pour something and that let it solidify. Now you've  got a slab. And it's just a network of things that interact. And the  principle of the thing is that, so you have to get the molecules to  move.</p>
<p>Well that's pretty easy with nucleic acids because they're  charged. They have all those phosphates. They've got a lot of negative  charge. So if you apply an electric field, they'll move. And the  principle of the thing is that if you're big, it's harder to wiggle  through this network than if you are small. Or you can think of a big,  fat person trying to go through a forest with a lot of trees, and a  little skinny one. And if we let them have a race, eventually the skinny  one will emerge from the forest first.</p>
<p>And so, if we had a set of  markers down on the side where this is big, and this is small, and we  take this piece of DNA, we're going to get two fragments. The bigger one  would be the vector and the smaller one would be an insert. So from  that, we could say, oh, if I didn't know what I started with I could say  what must be in that plasmid? Is the vector? And I can run it all by  itself and see it's exactly the same size.</p>
<p>And I got an insert of  this particular size. And now, can I learn anything more about that just  using restriction enzymes? And let's say I now take the same. Actually,  maybe I'll do it over here. So let's cut, this time, with EcoRI plus  another restriction enzyme. They all have these weird names: BamHI, and  let's see what happens. Well suppose I do that and I get something like  this.</p>
<p>Well it looks like the vector wasn't cut at all. That still  seems to be the same, but it looks as though the insert got cut into two  pieces. Since it was linear, it must have one site in it. And so, this  molecule that I cloned could look, be one of two kinds of ways. It could  be like this. Let's say this is the insert. Here's the EcoRI. I'll use  this SalI to orient us.</p>
<p>So, the Bam site could either be close  over here. Or it could be over on the other side. Does that make sense?  The logic is pretty simple. How can I tell which of those is correct?  Just doing the kind of stuff I'm doing. Beautiful, beautiful. So if we  cut with the SalI plus the BamHI. In one case, one would get a fragment  like that. In the other case, get a fragment like that. That should feel  easily familiar to you.</p>
<p>It should feel just like what we are  doing what we did that phage cross, and we had some genes that were  lined up. And we were trying to figure, was the orientation this way? Or  was the orientation that? That was exactly the same principle. And so  this is usually, in the lab you'd call this restriction mapping, or  making a restriction map. And it enabled people to manipulate fragments  of DNA and make inferences about their orientation and other features  before we can actually even sequence DNA.</p>
<p>And that's just part of  routine sort of stuff you do a lab. The equipment is disarmingly simple.  It looks something like that, usually you're putting some colored dye  so you can see that the things are moving down the gel. And the way you  visualize the DNA is you add a molecule. The name of it doesn't  particularly matter. It's called ethidium bromide. But its property is  it doesn't fluoresce when it's just in solution.</p>
<p>But it's a flat  molecule, and it can intercalate in between the base pairs in DNA. They  have all those stacked base pairs going down a helix. This molecule's  flat, and it likes to slip inside. And now it's a much more hydrophobic  environment. It's hidden from the water, becomes florescent. And so, DNA  that's soaked up this dye then will fluoresce when you put a UV light  on it.</p>
<p>So if I take the gel out of there after I've run it, and  soak it in this dye and then shine a little handheld UV light on it, it  would look something like that if I photographed it. And so, you would  end up with those patterns that look exactly like that. Oops, I guess I  took the other one out. But you can, of course, depending on how  complicated it is, you could have a lot of different fragments.</p>
<p>OK,  so the next big thing that had to happen in order for us to really move  to where we are in today's molecular biology was somehow, DNA had to be  sequenced. And as I say, when I was an undergrad, or even when I was  just about to start, when I was a postdoc anyway, just again it seemed  like how would you ever do it? Because every nucleotide was joined by a  phosphodiester bond.</p>
<p>The only difference was the base that was  there. It seemed very, very difficult. It was hard to imagine you would  ever be able to sort out the sequence of a billion base pairs. Of  course, you could clone. Now you've got maybe a fragment of DNA that's a  couple hundred base pairs long, and at least the problem becomes  smaller. Maybe you could work it out. Now, there were a couple of  different ways of doing it.</p>
<p>One was by Wally Gilbert, who's up at  Harvard who got half the Nobel Prize for doing this. The other  principle, the other one that's proved to be most generally useful is  Fred Sanger from England. And he and Wally shared the Nobel Prize for  discovering sequencing. And the principal was disarmingly simple. I  think it's one of these great ideas do you look back at afterward and  think, I could have thought of that.</p>
<p>You guys already know  everything you need to invent how to sequence DNA. I've told you all the  stuff already. But nobody's come down to tell me that you've got it.  And I didn't think of it. So here is the principal. What we've talked  about, if we take a DNA polymerase plus the four deoxynucleotide  triphosphate's, remember we talked about deoxyribonucleotide, the  adenosine triphosphate, and so on.</p>
<p>There's four different ones.  And we take a primer. And there's a three prime hydroxyl right there.  And so this is the other strand is going the opposite direction. If we  add that, I think you all know what's going to happen. We're going to  get an extension to the other end. And what happens every time we add a  nucleotide is that three prime hydroxyl attacks the phosphate of the  triphosphate. We lose two of the phosphates.</p>
<p>This is called  pyrophosphate, and we've created a new five to three prime linkage. That  gives us a new three prime hydroxyl, and we repeat the process, right?  That's what we talked about. So, what would happen, let's spike in a  little, let me do it. It's a little dideoxy TTP. So this is dideoxy. But  what would we mean by that? Well, if this, remember where the deoxy  came from? The ribose has at the two prime position has a hydrogen  instead of a hydroxyl, and at the three prime position it has a  hydroxyl.</p>
<p>If we made a dideoxy, what we do is we'd make that. What  could that nucleotide do? Well, as long as the polymerase thought it  was useful it would use this end, it would have its triphosphate up  here. So, somebody else's three prime OH could come down and form a bond  to here and we'd lose this. So it could get incorporated. That chain is  finished. It can't be elongated anymore. So, let's think what would  happen if we had, let me stretch this out a little bit here, and let's  imagine we had a few A's in the sequence.</p>
<p>So, we are just going to  spike it a bit. So, most of the things will not see a dideoxy. So, this  primer will put, we'll try elongating this. So when we get to this  point, this point many of them will put it an ordinary A, but a few will  put it a dideoxy. And those will finish. At that point, they can't go  any farther. The rest of them keep going, they add various nucleotides.  When we get to the next A, most of them will put them a good T, but the  ones that put in a dideoxy will stop, and they will generate a fragment  that looks like that.</p>
<p>You get the idea. Out of this reaction, we  are going to get a set of fragments. And each one terminates where there  was an A up there. Now, in this newer emulation of this thing, we have a  T. And the trick is to put a dye that you can attach to this  nucleotide, so it has a particular color. So, suppose we had something  that was yellow.</p>
<p>Then this particular set of fragments would be  yellow. And maybe you can begin to see what would happen now. If we did  the same game three more times, each time using a different dideoxy,  next time maybe we'll use dideoxy A. And we'll put a different colored  dye on it. Then every time, in this case we come to a T in the template,  it would stop, and we'd get a little fragment that's stopped because it  incorporated a dideoxy A, and those would be, let's say, green.</p>
<p>So,  by the end of this, we would have all possible fragments if we mixed  them all together and the last nucleotide on each fragment would say who  it was by its color. So, if you were to, then, take this whole mixture  of DNA fragments and you run them down a gel, in this case it's a  different; it's a polyacrylamide gel because you have smaller trying to  get things to go by smaller fragments.</p>
<p>You could sort of see what  would happen. The big ones would be at the top. The small ones would be  at the bottom. And you'd see each band would have a different color  depending on the dideoxy that terminated its chain. So, if you had a  little scanner that just goes along, it can read this, and it will print  out something. And these are always slightly idealized.</p>
<p>This is a  real one. But this is the sort of stuff you get back. If you send a  piece of DNA over to a sequencing center, they'd send this back as a  file or something. And you'd sit there. And it's very good these days.  The technology wasn't as good, but they can almost always now get the  sequence. Occasionally, you'll get something like a run of G's that gets  a little hard, but what they'll do is they'll sort of what they call  sequencing both strands.</p>
<p>You can see this way, but really only  looking at the information of one strand. So, if we took the other  strand. So if we took the other strand, and we did the same thing, but  we should get the complementary piece of information. So, what this DNA  sequencing allows you to do, then, is determine the exact sequence of  nucleotides in some kind of piece. And much of the art from the rest of  it then comes, how do you assemble all of those things together? In the  case of a bacteria or something, it wasn't so bad because its DNA was  small enough.</p>
<p>You could cut it into a bunch of sort of big  fragments, and then take each one of those, and then the sorting problem  was relatively simple. In the case of something like humans, it was  really complicated because there were so much more DNA. And the other  thing is higher organisms such as yourselves have a lot of repeated DNA.  It's just the same sequence, and sometimes there's quite a bit of it, a  bunch of repeats.</p>
<p>And so, if you see that at the end of your  thing, you don't really quite know where you are in the genome. So a lot  of other tricks had to be brought into play, including knowledge of the  human genetic map. And so you could get yourself anchored at various  places because you knew on this particular piece of DNA, because it was  associated with some gene, had to be here on the chromosome. And  therefore, things at least at least beside it were there on the  chromosome.</p>
<p>And there were a whole lot of tricks to putting it  together. But the very basic principle of how we sequence DNA has at its  heart the same process that I was talking to you about as when we were  doing DNA replication, except in this case it's just used in a very  clever way. And that was an amazing idea. It got a Nobel Prize, and  you've been sitting here for the last month with all the knowledge to do  it.</p>
<p>I keep emphasizing that you've got to have that three prime  hydroxyl. But some of the great ideas often when you look back you could  see it was the hurdle was kind of small. And they didn't even have to  do this with dyes at the beginning. In fact, that was a later  innovation. The key thing was just the dideoxies stopping in each place.  I was lucky enough to live through some of this, the development of  this technology.</p>
<p>OK, so I've got one more really big thing to tell  you, which again was extraordinarily clever, but extraordinarily simple  once you heard about it. And it was one more technological advance. It  wasn't a big insight into biology in and of itself, but it was a  technology that opened up just incredible experimental possibilities.  And it's something known as the Polymerase Chain Reaction.</p>
<p>And  this allows, in principle, someone like me to go and to grab a single  cell from you, take it to DNA, and get a copy of any gene I want from  your genome. And I can look and see whether you have any mutations in  that genome, or whether there are different polymorphic alleles in the  population, in which one you've got from your mom, or which one you got  from your dad. So, you take from a single DNA molecule, I can make as  much as I want.</p>
<p>And this is just like DNA sequencing. You guys  already know everything you need to know to invent this technique as  well. It has very much that same property. It's another one of these  very brilliant insights that you just had to put things in the right  place. So let me explain the principle. So, suppose that I would like to  know there's a gene that I know there's a family history of something,  and I would like to know, did I happen to get the allele that carries  that? Or did I get the one that didn't? So, in principle what I would  like to do is to get a hold of the piece of DNA for that gene from my  own cells.</p>
<p>But all I've started with is my entire DNA. Well, I  could clone it. I could make a recombinant library. I could do  everything else. But there's this other simple way. And one way this  involves, what it involves taking, is since I know the sequence of the  genome now, I know that almost everything is going to the same. There  will be little differences between individuals.</p>
<p>I'll make a little  primer that corresponds to the sequence at one end of the gene, and  another primer that corresponds to the DNA at the other end of the gene,  or whatever fragment I want to use. And that's all I have to do in  terms of getting anything made. Now the rest, we are just going to play  games with DNA, with DNA polymerase, and nucleoside triphosphates, just  all the stuff I dragged you through talking about DNA replication.</p>
<p>So  here's the idea. So here's my DNA, let's say, or part of it. If I could  actually see the sequence, I would know, let's say, the gene I'm  interested in is in here. So, what I would do is make a little primer.  It just has to be enough to confer specificity for something with  humans. If I make something probably 30 nucleotides long, that's enough.</p>
<p>It'll  only bind one place in the DNA. And I make one, let's say, for the  opposite strand over here. So remember, this is five prime, three prime,  five prime to three prime. The principle is we'll heat to 95?C, and  will denature the DNA. And we'll add an excess of the two primers. And  let's say we'll cool to 55?C, or something. And we'll cool it down  enough so that we can get the primers on. But we are not going to go all  the way and let all the strands find their way back.</p>
<p>And we'll  add a DNA polymerase plus four deoxy nucleoside triphosphates. Well,  what will happen? Well, here's one of the strands. And we'll prime it  here, let's say. So, it will copy down here and go as far as it can go.  And the other one starts here. And it's going to go down all that way.  Let's just repeat the whole process now, OK? What'll happen? Now when we  pull them apart, we ought to have four strands.</p>
<p>We'll have the  original ones here, and when I repeat the process, the same thing's  going to happen again. This one will go here, and it will copy out. This  one will go here. It will copy out. But what about this guy? So, this  one becomes this one here. So the primer that it does will copy it, and  it can't go any further. I just generated a piece that's exactly what I  wanted.</p>
<p>And the same deal here: as long as I don't get lost, which  what did I do? So, we've got this guy here. So, it starts there. So  this one becomes this one, and we'll prime it here. It'll go along and  it will stop. So there's the complementary strand to the one here. And I  think this is sort of like doing a math problem. You can't just look at  it and say, well maybe you will get it.</p>
<p>But there's nothing like  sitting down with a pencil and paper, and take yourself through several  cycles. What you will believe is how quickly you get to get being  nothing but, almost nothing, but the sequence that you are trying to  amplify. And so, this again has an astonishing effect. This is why you  hear about DNA testing all the time in forensics, because you can take a  tiny bit of DNA from saliva, or semen, or blood, or whatever they might  find on a crime scene, and then they can amplify little pieces and they  compare.</p>
<p>And there's a trick they use in forensics, and that is  that there are sequences within the human genome where the little  variable repeats like GT, GT, GT, GT, GT, GT, and I might have 14 of  them in one of my chromosomes. The one I got from my mom might have 40.  You might have 24 and something else, and so on. If you were to do PCR  around a little region that was known to be variable, if you had 14  repeats you'd get a shorter fragment.</p>
<p>And if you had 40 repeats,  you get a longer fragment. So, I'll come back to that in a sec. So, if  you were to, for example, take something with a long repeat and a short  repeat into this kind of thing. We get two fragments, say, one from the  paternal. And if you do this with several such sites around the genome,  pretty soon you run into situations where the odds of a particular  combination of a long one at the site, a short one at the site, and so  on, becomes statistically improbable that it's anyone other than  yourself.</p>
<p>So on a crime scene, if they did this, they, for  example, might have three individuals that they were thinking was  possible. And they'd generate patterns like this, say, using three  different loci like this, and then have the forensic sample. And it was  pretty evident who didn't do it, and who at least remains a suspect.  This probably wouldn't prove it. The very last thing, just to close us  off, is when people developed the PCR technique, you had to sit there  with your pipette because every time you raised it to 90? to denature  the DNA you killed your enzyme.</p>
<p>So, you cool it down to 55, you  squirted in a new DNA polymerase. And then someone finally said, another  brilliant idea, what if I had a thermoresistant polymerase? Where would  I find those? Well, Penny was talking to you about those vents where  it's really, really hot, and those black smokers and everything, so  maybe you got a bacterium from there. It would have a temperature  resistant polymerase.</p>
<p>So here you are from the New England  Biocatalog, vent exo-minus DNA polymerase, deep vent DNA polymerase.  People went to grab those bacteria from there, grabbed the DNA  polymerase gene. And now, the DNA polymerase just sits there. It just  laughs and you bring it up to 90?. And when you cool it back down and  give it a substrate again, it will do its thing.</p>
<p>And so, this  whole thing can be done automatic and you don't have to sit there and  pipette something in at the end of every run, another little cute sort  of engineering trick that combined ecology together with biology. OK,  see you on Friday.</p>
