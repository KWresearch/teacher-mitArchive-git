Transcript â€“ Lecture 25 

What we've ta lked about in recombinant DNA so far is how to get a piece of DNA 
from somewhere and make a whole lot of copies of it. So, instead of working with 
DNA extracted from my cells, which there's 3 billion d ifferent base pairs of sequence, 
we can find a little stretch of DNA. But simp ly being ab le to clone it, it was a long 
way from being ab le to get a lot of a fragment of DNA to be ab le to figure out what 
that sequence is. 

That sequence of that gene is actually from the xeroderma gene, the gene that's 
broken in the xeroderma p igmentosum variant patient, missing one of these 
translesion DNA polymerases that can copy over a thymine-thymine, pyrimidine 
dimmer induced by UV light. So the reason they have that problem w ith their skin 
after sunlight is because they are missing a polymerase that can't copy over 
accurately over this very common lesion caused by DNA damage. 

But how do you get from having a piece of DNA and having the sequence? So,  the 
first thing that people learn to do, and you still do this all the time  in any molecular 
biology lab. We're sort of switching now in engineering as you'll see. You're going to 
see in the next things that I'm going to say, proteins that were, I ta lked to you about 
because of their biolog ical roles. 

DNA polymerase is, ligases, we learned what they do. And now you're going to see 
them used in manipulative ways. Restriction enzymes: they have a b iological 
purpose, too. They weren't put on Earth  for me to cut up DNA into  fragments and 
clone. They were there to give the bacteria some kind of primitive immune system. 
But the first thing that you often have to do, and you have, let's say, a p lasmid into 
which we've inserted a fragment. 

And let's say it was the kind of cloning we described the other day, where I had cut 
to the vector with an EcoRI site, and the other DNA w ith an EcoRI site. So these, the 
junction between the  inserted  fragment and the cut vector has re-created two EcoRI 
sites now. And if I cut with EcoRI, I'll just undo what I did in the cloning, and we 
should get the vector DNA and the insert DNA back again. 

So, I can go from this vector to g ive us an orientation. I'm going to imagine that it 
has one more restriction site. This one is ca lled SalI. It just recognizes a d ifferent 
sequence. So, if I take the plasmid DNA and cut with EcoRI, I'm just reversing the 
cloning. So I should get the vector DNA and the  insert that I generated in the first 
place. 

But I have to detect them somehow. Unfortunately, they don't just look in the test 
tube like that. So, what peop le do  is they use a very simp le principle. It's called gel 
electrophoresis. And the idea is you just make a gel of something. In this particular 
case, it's just made of agar, which is agarose. These are polysaccharide products, 
often derived from seaweed or something like that. They have the property that if 
you warm them up, they're liquid, and that if you let them cool down, they're a gel. 

You've run into Jell-O which has that property. That's actually made of a protein 
rather than a carbohydrate. But it's that kind of principle. So  it's very easy to pour 
something and that let it solidify. Now you've got a slab. And  it's just a network of 
things that interact. And the principle of the thing is that, so you have to get the 
molecules to move. 

Well that's pretty easy with nucleic acids because they're charged. They have a ll 
those phosphates. They've got a lot of negative charge. So if you apply an electric 
field,  they'll move. And the princip le of the thing is that if you're big, it's harder to 
wiggle through this network than if you are sma ll. Or you can think of a big, fat 
person trying to go through a  forest w ith a lot of trees, and a little skinny one. And if 
we let them have a  race, eventua lly the skinny one w ill emerge from the forest first. 

And so, if we had a set of markers down on the side where this is b ig, and this  is 
sma ll, and we take this piece of DNA, we're going to get two fragments. The bigger 
one would be the vector and the sma ller one would be an insert. So from that, we 
could say, oh, if I didn't know what I started w ith I could say what must be in that 
plasmid? Is the vector? And  I can run it all by itself and see it's exactly the same 
size. 

And I got an insert of this particular size. And now, can I  learn anything more about 
that just using  restriction enzymes? And let's say I now take the same. Actually, 
maybe I'll do it over here. So let's cut, this time, with EcoRI plus another restriction 
enzyme. They all have these weird names: BamHI, and let's see what happens. Well 
suppose I do that and I get something like this. 

Well it looks like the vector wasn't cut at a ll. That still seems to be the same, but it 
looks as though the insert got cut into two p ieces. Since it was linear, it must have 
one site  in it. And so, this molecule that I cloned could look, be one of two kinds of 
ways. It could be like this. Let's say this is the insert. Here's the EcoRI. I'll use this 
SalI to orient us. 

So, the Bam site could either be close over here. Or it could be over on the other 
side. Does that make sense? The logic is pretty simple. How can I tell which of those 
is correct? Just doing the kind of stuff I'm doing. Beautiful, beautiful. So if we cut 
with the SalI p lus the BamHI. In one case, one would get a fragment like that. In the 
other case, get a  fragment like that. That should feel easily familiar to you. 

It should feel just like what we are doing what we did that phage cross, and we had 
some genes that were lined up. And we were trying to figure, was the orientation 
this way? Or was the orientation that? That was exactly the same principle. And so 
this is usually,  in the lab you'd call this restriction mapping, or making a  restriction 
map. And it enab led peop le to manipulate fragments of DNA and make inferences 
about their orientation and other features before we can actua lly even sequence 
DNA. 

And that's just part of routine sort of stuff you do a lab. The equipment is 
disarming ly simple. It looks something like that, usua lly you're putting some colored 
dye so you can see that the things are moving down the gel. And the way you 
visua lize the DNA is you add a molecule. The name of it doesn't particularly matter. 
It's ca lled ethidium bromide. But its property is it doesn't fluoresce when it's just in 
solution. 

But it's a  flat molecule, and it can interca late in between the base pa irs in DNA. They 
have all those stacked base pa irs going down a helix. This molecule's flat, and it likes 
to slip inside. And now it's a much more hydrophobic environment. It's hidden  from 
the water, becomes florescent. And so, DNA that's soaked up this dye then w ill 
fluoresce when you put a UV  light on it. 

So if I take the gel out of there after I've run it, and soak it in this dye and then 
shine a little handheld UV  light on it, it would look something  like that if I 
photographed it. And so, you would end up w ith those patterns that look exactly like 
that. Oops, I guess I took the other one out. But you can, of course, depend ing on 
how complicated it is, you could have a lot of different fragments. 

OK, so  the next b ig thing that had to happen in order for us to rea lly move to where 
we are in today's molecular b iology was somehow, DNA had to be sequenced. And as 
I say, when I was an undergrad, or even when I was just about to start, when I was 
a postdoc anyway, just again  it seemed like how would you ever do it? Because 
every nucleotide was joined by a phosphodiester bond. 

The only difference was the base that was there. It seemed very, very difficult. It 
was hard to imagine you would ever be able to sort out the sequence of a billion 
base pa irs. Of course, you could clone. Now you've got maybe a fragment of DNA 
that's a couple hundred base pairs long, and at least the problem becomes smaller. 
Maybe you could work it out. Now, there were a couple of d ifferent ways of doing it. 

One was by Wally Gilbert, who 's up at Harvard who got ha lf the Nobel Prize for doing 
this. The other princip le, the other one that's proved to be most genera lly useful is 
Fred Sanger from England. And he and Wally shared the Nobel Prize for discovering 
sequencing. And the principal was d isarming ly simple. I think it's one of these great 
ideas do you look back at afterward and think, I could have thought of that. 

You guys a lready know everything you need to invent how to sequence DNA. I've 
told you all the stuff already. But nobody's come down to tell me that you've got it. 
And I didn't think of it. So here is the principa l. What we've ta lked about, if we take 
a DNA polymerase plus the four deoxynucleotide triphosphate's, remember we ta lked 
about deoxyribonucleotide, the adenosine triphosphate, and so on. 

There's four different ones. And we take a primer. And there's a three prime 
hydroxyl right there. And so  this is the other strand is going the opposite d irection. If 
we add that, I think you a ll know what's going to happen. We're going to get an 
extension to the other end. And what happens every time we add a nucleotide is that 
three prime hydroxyl attacks the phosphate of the triphosphate. We lose two of the 
phosphates. 

This is ca lled pyrophosphate, and we've created a new five to  three prime  linkage. 
That g ives us a new three prime hydroxyl, and we repeat the process, right? That's 
what we talked about. So, what would happen, let's sp ike in a  little, let me do it. It's 
a little d ideoxy TTP. So this is dideoxy. But what would we mean by that? Well, if 
this, remember where the deoxy came from? The ribose has at the two prime 
position has a hydrogen instead of a hydroxyl, and at the three prime position it has 
a hydroxyl. 

If we made a dideoxy, what we do is we'd make that. What could that nucleotide do? 
Well, as long as the polymerase thought it was useful it would use this end, it would 

have its triphosphate up here. So, somebody else's three prime OH could come down 
and form a bond to here and we'd lose this. So it could get incorporated. That cha in 
is finished. It can't be elongated anymore. So, let's think what would happen  if we 
had, let me stretch this out a little bit here, and  let's imag ine we had a few A's in the 
sequence. 

So, we are just going to spike it a b it. So, most of the things will not see a dideoxy. 
So, this primer w ill put, we'll try elongating this. So when we get to this point, this 
point many of them will put it an ordinary A, but a few will put it a dideoxy. And 
those w ill finish. At that point, they can't go any farther. The rest of them keep 
going, they add various nucleotides. When we get to the next A, most of them will 
put them a good T, but the ones that put  in a d ideoxy w ill stop, and they w ill 
generate a fragment that looks like that. 

You get the idea. Out of this reaction, we are going to get a set of fragments. And 
each one terminates where there was an A up there. Now, in this newer emulation of 
this thing, we have a T. And the trick is to put a dye that you can attach to this 
nucleotide, so it has a particular color. So, suppose we had something that was 
yellow. 

Then this particular set of fragments would be yellow. And maybe you can beg in to 
see what would happen now. If we d id the same game three more times, each time 
using a d ifferent dideoxy, next time maybe we'll use d ideoxy A. And we'll put a 
different colored dye on it. Then every time, in this case we come to a T in the 
template, it would stop, and we'd get a little fragment that's stopped because it 
incorporated a dideoxy A, and those would be, let's say, green. 

So, by the end of this, we would have all possible fragments if we mixed them a ll 
together and the last nucleotide on each  fragment would say who it was by its color. 
So, if you were to, then, take this whole mixture of DNA fragments and you run 
them down a gel, in this case it's a different; it's a polyacrylamide gel because you 
have smaller trying  to get things to go by smaller fragments. 

You could sort of see what would happen. The big ones would be at the top. The 
sma ll ones would be at the bottom. And you'd see each band would have a different 
color depending on the dideoxy that terminated its cha in. So, if you had a little 
scanner that just goes a long, it can read this, and it w ill print out something. And 
these are always slightly idealized. 

This is a real one. But this is the sort of stuff you get back. If you send a piece of 
DNA over to a sequencing center, they'd send this back as a file or something. And 
you'd sit there. And it's very good these days. The technology wasn't as good, but 
they can almost always now get the sequence. Occasionally, you'll get something like 
a run of G's that gets a little hard, but what they'll do is they'll sort of what they call 
sequencing both strands. 

You can see this way, but really only looking at the information of one strand. So, if 
we took the other strand. So if we took the other strand, and we did the same thing, 
but we should get the comp lementary piece of information. So, what this DNA 
sequencing a llows you to do, then, is determine the exact sequence of nucleotides in 
some kind of piece. And much of the art from the rest of it then comes, how do you 
assemble all of those things together? In the case of a bacteria or something, it 
wasn't so bad because its DNA was small enough. 

You could cut it into a bunch of sort of b ig fragments, and  then take each one of 
those, and then the sorting problem was relatively simp le. In the case of something 
like humans,  it was really comp licated because there were so much more DNA. And 
the other thing is higher organisms such as yourselves have a lot of repeated DNA. 
It's just the same sequence, and sometimes there's quite a b it of it, a bunch of 
repeats. 

And so, if you see that at the end of your thing, you don't rea lly quite know where 
you are in the genome. So a lot of other tricks had to be brought into p lay, includ ing 
know ledge of the human genetic map. And so you could get yourself anchored at 
various places because you knew on this particular piece of DNA, because it was 
associated with some gene, had to be here on the chromosome. And therefore, 
things at least at  least beside it were there on the chromosome. 

And there were a whole lot of tricks to putting it together. But the very basic 
principle of how we sequence DNA has at its heart the same process that I was 
talking to you about as when we were doing DNA replication, except in this case it's 
just used in a very clever way. And that was an amazing idea. It got a Nobel Prize, 
and you've been sitting here for the last month with all the know ledge to do it. 

I keep emphasizing that you've got to have that three prime hydroxyl. But some of 
the great ideas often when you look back you could see it was the hurdle was kind of 
sma ll. And they d idn't even have to do this with dyes at the beginning. In  fact, that 
was a  later innovation. The key thing was just the dideoxies stopping in each p lace. I 
was lucky enough to live through some of this, the development of this technology. 

OK, so I've got one more really b ig thing to tell you, which again was extraord inarily 
clever, but extraord inarily simple once you heard about it. And it was one more 
technological advance. It wasn't a big insight into biology in and of itself, but it was a 
technology that opened up just incred ible experimenta l possib ilities. And it's 
something known as the Polymerase Chain Reaction. 

And this allows, in principle, someone like me to go and to grab a sing le cell from 
you,  take it to DNA, and get a copy of any gene I want from your genome. And I can 
look and see whether you have any mutations in that genome, or whether there are 
different polymorphic alleles in the population, in which one you've got from your 
mom, or which one you got from your dad. So, you take from a single DNA molecule, 
I can make as much as I want. 

And this is just like DNA sequencing. You guys a lready know everything you need to 
know to invent this technique as well. It has very much that same property. It's 
another one of these very brilliant insights that you just had to put things in the right 
place. So  let me expla in the principle. So, suppose that I would like to know there's a 
gene that I know there's a  family history of something, and I would  like to know, did 
I happen to get the allele that carries that? Or did I get the one that didn't? So,  in 
principle what I would like to do is to get a hold of the piece of DNA for that gene 
from my own cells. 

But all I've started w ith is my entire DNA. Well, I could clone it. I could make a 
recombinant library. I could do everything else. But there's this other simp le way. 
And one way this involves, what it involves taking, is since I know the sequence of 

the genome now, I know that a lmost everything is going to the same. There will be 
little differences between individua ls. 

I'll make a little primer that corresponds to the sequence at one end of the gene, and 
another primer that corresponds to the DNA at the other end of the gene, or 
whatever fragment I want to use. And that's all I have to do in terms of getting 
anything made. Now the rest, we are just going to p lay games with DNA, w ith DNA 
polymerase, and nucleoside triphosphates, just all the stuff I dragged you through 
talking about DNA replication. 

So here's the idea. So here's my DNA,  let's say, or part of  it. If I could actually see 
the sequence, I would know, let's say,  the gene I'm interested in is in here. So, what 
I would do is make a little primer. It just has to be enough to confer specificity for 
something with humans. If I make something probably 30 nucleotides long, that's 
enough. 

It'll only bind one p lace  in the DNA. And I make one, let's say, for the opposite 
strand over here. So remember, this is five prime, three prime, five prime to three 
prime. The princip le is we'll heat to 95Â°C, and w ill denature the DNA. And we'll add 
an excess of the two primers. And let's say we'll cool to 55Â°C, or something. And 
we'll cool it down enough so that we can get the primers on. But we are not going to 
go all the way and let a ll the strands find their way back. 

And we'll add a DNA polymerase p lus four deoxy nucleoside triphosphates. Well, 
what will happen? Well, here's one of the strands. And we'll prime it here, let's say. 
So, it w ill copy down here and go as far as it can go. And the other one starts here. 
And it's going to go down a ll that way. Let's just repeat the whole process now, OK? 
What'll happen? Now when we pull them apart, we ought to have four strands. 

We'll have the original ones here, and when I repeat the process, the same thing 's 
going to happen aga in. This one will go here, and it w ill copy out. This one w ill go 
here. It w ill copy out. But what about this guy? So, this one becomes this one here. 
So the primer that it does w ill copy it, and it can't go any further. I just generated a 
piece that's exactly what I wanted. 

And the same dea l here: as long as I don't get lost, which what d id I do? So, we've 
got this guy here. So, it starts there. So this one becomes this one, and we'll prime it 
here. It'll go a long and it w ill stop. So there's the complementary strand to the one 
here. And  I think this is sort of like doing a math problem. You can't just look at it 
and say, well maybe you w ill get it. 

But there's nothing like sitting down w ith a pencil and paper, and take yourself 
through several cycles. What you will believe is how quickly you get to get being 
nothing but, a lmost nothing, but the sequence that you are trying to amplify. And so, 
this again has an astonishing effect. This  is why you hear about DNA testing a ll the 
time in forensics, because you can take a tiny bit of DNA  from saliva, or semen, or 
blood, or whatever they might find on a crime scene, and then they can amp lify little 
pieces and they compare. 

And there's a trick they use in forensics, and that is that there are sequences within 
the human genome where the little variab le repeats like GT, GT, GT, GT, GT, GT, and 
I might have 14 of them in one of my chromosomes. The one I got from my mom 
might have 40. You might have 24 and something else, and so on. If you were to do 

PCR around a little region that was known to be variable, if you had 14 repeats you'd 
get a shorter fragment. 

And if you had 40 repeats, you get a longer fragment. So, I'll come back to that in a 
sec. So, if you were to,  for examp le, take something with a long  repeat and a short 
repeat into this kind of thing. We get two  fragments, say, one from the paternal. And 
if you do this w ith several such sites around the genome, pretty soon you run into 
situations where the odds of a particular comb ination of a long one at the site, a 
short one at the site, and so on, becomes statistica lly improbab le that it's anyone 
other than yourself. 

So on a crime scene, if they did  this, they,  for examp le, might have three individua ls 
that they were thinking was possible. And they'd generate patterns like this, say, 
using three d ifferent loci like this, and then have the forensic sample. And it was 
pretty evident who d idn't do it, and who at  least remains a suspect. This probably 
wouldn't prove it. The very last thing, just to close us off, is when peop le developed 
the PCR technique, you had to sit there with your p ipette because every time you 
raised it to 90Â° to denature the DNA you killed your enzyme. 

So, you cool it down to 55, you squirted in a new DNA polymerase. And then 
someone finally said, another brilliant idea, what if I had a thermoresistant 
polymerase? Where would I find those? Well, Penny was talking to you about those 
vents where  it's rea lly, really hot, and those b lack smokers and everything, so 
maybe you got a bacterium from there. It would have a temperature resistant 
polymerase. 

So here you are from the New England Biocata log, vent exo-minus DNA polymerase, 
deep vent DNA polymerase. Peop le went to grab those bacteria from there, grabbed 
the DNA polymerase gene. And now, the DNA polymerase just sits there. It just 
laughs and you bring it up to 90Â°. And when you cool it back down and g ive it a 
substrate again, it will do its thing. 

And so, this whole thing can be done automatic and you don't have to sit there and 
pipette something in at the end of every run, another little cute sort of eng ineering 
trick that combined ecology together with b iology. OK, see you on Friday.
