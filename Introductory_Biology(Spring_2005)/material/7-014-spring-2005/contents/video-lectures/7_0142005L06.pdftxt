Transcript â€“ Lecture 6 

OK. Today we're going to get into some stuff where we're kind of peering way back 
in evolution about how life first learned to make energy. But before we do that I just 
want to  finish up talking a little bit more about enzymes, the biolog ica l catalysts that 
are critical for life to exist and about how energy is stored. I want to clarify a point 
that clearly confused a couple of you in the last  lecture. 

So the Gibbs free energy that we ta lked about can tell us that a  reaction could go 
and, in this case, would actua lly release energy if it occurred, if these reactants were 
converted to these products. But the problem  for most reactions is that in order for 
the reaction to take place there's a state in the middle, some chemica l state known 
as the transition state which  is energetically less favorable than either the reactants 
or the products. 

And if A and B are going to convert to C and D they have to probab ly start coming 
together in some kind of way, and  that becomes energetically unfavorable. And this 
gives this activation energy -- -- or delta G00. And if the cell wants chemical 
reactions to take place at 25 degrees Centigrade aqueous solution it has to do 
something about that, and so it employs b iological catalysts. And what a cata lyst 
does, as you've heard in chemistry, is it lowers the activation energy in some way so 
that the molecules have enough energy just within their norma l energy d istribution 
at that temperature to get over the hump. 

These biolog ical catalysts come in two flavors. As I sa id there are enzymes which are 
made of protein w ith a ll of those amino acids, the side cha ins that we ta lked about 
when the thing folds up in 3-d imensiona l space form a little chemical environment 
that enables that activation energy to be lowered. There are a lso few -- Not so 
many. But we now know that there are cata lysts made out of RNA. 

These are called ribozymes. There are not so many of them but they're  important. 
Now, the characteristics of these that are important is the specificity -- Each enzyme 
or ribozyme is highly specific for a g iven reaction. So that means the reaction 
probably will barely go unless that enzyme or, in some cases, ribozyme is present. 
And so that's rea lly the secret to how cells control a ll of these many, many, many 
hundreds or thousands of chemical reactions that take place that are necessary for 
life. 

Because what they need to do, and if they want to control whether a reaction takes 
place or not is they to control the availability or the activity of an enzyme. And when 
we talk about gene regulation you'll see, for example, one way a cell might do it is to 
not even bother to make the enzyme unless it wants a particular reaction to take 
place. Or it could take an enzyme that's there and put little bells and whistles on it 
that make it more active or less active. 

And we'll see an example of that pretty soon. That is the secret to how cells are then 
able to regulate metabolism. And these biological cata lysts use a whole variety of 
different molecular mechanisms, a lthough a ll of them follow this principle of what 

they're trying to do is lower the activation energy. So I'll just give you an example. I 
showed you how one particular enzyme does it just  in sort of cartoon form. 

I gave you the examp le of glutamate being converted to glutamine. Now, both of 
those are amino acids that are critical for making proteins. The cell has to make both 
of them. But as I showed you converting g lutamate to g lutamine is energetica lly 
unfavorab le. It's got a delta G plus 7. And then I showed you if you had an ATP 
going to ADP at the same time you could actually drive the whole reaction  forward 
because there was a net ga in. 

But how is that actually accomplished? And it's the enzyme that carries this out. And 
I'll just show you, as I say, in sort of cartoon  form. The way the enzyme works it has 
one binding pocket for glutamic acid or glutamate. It fits in here. It makes lots of 
specialized contacts, a ll those sort of molecular interactions we're talking about. And 
it also binds this molecule adenine triphosphate or ATP which is an adenine, a ribose 
and then three phosphates joined together. 

And it makes interactions along here that enable it to b ind very specifically. Now, by 
providing a ll this bind ing energy for ATP and  for glutamic acid what the enzyme has 
done is positioned the carboxyl group of glutamic acid right next to the last 
phosphate on the ATP. This enab les this to form a bond here which liberates ADP and 
leaves you now with the glutamic acid with a phosphate on. 

That reaction goes forward because you broke the bond of ATP, but this is still a 
pretty unhappy molecule. It's got a lot of oxygens at very close proximity. So the 
enzyme has another b inding pocket that's absolutely specific for ammonia. It won't 
fit water which is very close, which is a good thing because that would just reverse 
the process. Ammonia gets in there and then it attacks here and liberates the 
phosphate. 

And that then gives you glutamine and the inorganic phosphate. So the enzyme has 
provided this binding surface that makes the reactions go under b iological cond itions. 
But it's a lso managed in the same process to have  it go by a mechanism in which it 
sort of temporarily captured that energy that's in the ATP bond and then used it to 
drive the rest of the reaction. 

I mean it's the magic of how a ll of this developed. It's really amazing but that's how 
every single biochemical step in your body takes place. Virtually of them require an 
enzyme that in some way is highly tuned to do just the one single reaction. As I sa id, 
the principle of how these enzymes work is they lower the activation energy. And the 
way they do that in genera l is they provide a b inding pocket that resemb les the 
transition state. 

So as things approach here then it fits best into the pocket and therefore you get 
some energy back and kind of lowered the energy hump that's necessary to go over. 
And here's a reaction I'll be showing you in today's lecture. It's going to involve the 
transfer of a phosphate to a glucose. And the first thing that happens is this enzyme 
interacts w ith ATP and takes one of the phosphates and attaches it to one of its 
aspartic acid carboxyl groups. 

So you've got actually a mixed in hydride if you know chemistry. But aga in it's 
captured that phosphate. This is a very unstable bond. And so  if you break it you w ill 
release energy. And what the enzyme does is it allows the hydroxyl of here to come 

and attack this phosphate, and  that then releases the aspartate of the enzyme and 
you end up affecting the transfer of the phosphate that began life on ATP. 

And now it ends up on the g lucose. But, as you can see here, phosphate interacts 
with  four atoms. But as this hydroxyl comes in it has to attack the phosphate. And 
somewhere in the midd le there's an intermed iate where all of these things are 
interacting. And some crysta llographers actually managed to capture that in a crysta l 
structure. And here you can see this is the oxygen coming from the sugar, this is the 
oxygen of the aspartate and here is the phosphate where it's now, as the attack is 
taking p lace the thing is sort of pushed out, and it's caught right at that transition 
state. 

And that's what the enzyme is providing a bind ing pocket for and thereby lowering 
the activation energy. It's a  really beautiful piece of structural work. The second 
thing then I want to clarify was this molecule ATP which is, as I say, like energy 
money for the cell. When there's a  reaction where it can extract energy it tries to 
make ATP. And when there's a  reaction that doesn't want to go  it will somehow 
figure out a way to spend that energy and make the reaction go forward. 

And the molecule, just to put it again, because it's a pretty important one in biology. 
That's adenine which you already saw when we talked about nucleic acids. And it's 
got three phosphates like this. You can see it's probably a pretty unhappy molecule 
because it's got all of these oxygens stuck together. And if you break this bond then 
you release some energy. 

So you could think of it in this kind of way. That if we have ADP, which is adenosine 
diphosphate plus inorganic phosphate, and ATP is here. And if you were to break the 
bond and make it back into ADP and inorganic phosphate then you would have gone 
energetica lly downhill. But in order to make this you could think of it as taking an 
inorganic phosphate ion and this ADP, if you start pushing them together the 
negative charges are going to repel and you kind of go up an energy hill. 

But if you ever get them close enough then they start to share electrons and they fall 
into  this sort of energy well. And this is what ATP is. And so it's sort of like taking a 
spring and pushing it together. And then when you form the bond it's like you put a 
little hook on  it. And now you've got this spring  that's compressed. And it's stable, it 
won't do anything, but there's energy stored in there that you can use. 

And it's the same princip le in terms of how the cell stores energy within ATP. And 
this energy is stored -- -- if you think of  it in bundles of about 12 kiloca lories per 
mole. That's about how much energy is released under physiological cond itions when 
you hydrolyze that bond. So hydrolyzing ATP to give ADP plus inorganic phosphate 
will have a delta G of minus 12 kiloca lories per mole under physiological cond itions. 

Now something in terms of evolution, which I know a number of you sa id you were 
interested in, here's a  rea lly interesting thing. This  is the main energy storage 
molecule for the cell, but you've heard about it before because adenosine, that's the 
nucleotide that we find in RNA. And,  in fact, ATP is a lso the precursor, as we'll learn, 
for making RNA. 

And one of the things that puzz led scientists for many years is how did life ever get 
started in the first place? There seemed to be a chicken and an egg issue that 
proteins d id the work and DNA stored the information and RNA was kind of a 

messenger in between, and we'll talk a  lot about that in between. So how could you 
ever get life started? So the current thinking is that sometime, if you remember in 
that first lecture, we had about 4. 

5 b illion years ago the first organism, something like today's bacterium showed up 
here about maybe 3.8 b illion years ago. That somewhere in between there was what 
people are now thinking of as an "RNA world" where RNA managed to act as a 
ribosome and catalyzed chemical reactions, but it also had the capacity to store 
information. But it's sort of  intriguing, a lthough no one has proven that. 

It's just a hypothesis. We also see that the major energy storage molecule found in 
all living things is a lso a building b lock of RNA. It certainly sort of fits with that kind 
of idea. Now, there's one other kind of reaction I'm going to have to tell you about. 
Penny will ta lk quite a b it about this when you're thinking about how organisms 
make living. 

But this is a set of reactions known as "redox reactions". So the loss of one or more 
electron(s) is ca lled an oxidation. And the gain of one or more electron(s) is ca lled a 
reduction. If you're going to take away an electron somebody else has to get it. So 
these things always happen together. And therefore they're given the term redox 
reactions where electron(s) from somebody goes to somebody else. 

So somebody gets oxid ized and somebody gets reduced in the same reaction. And 
you can think of them as a transfer of hydrogen atoms, not hydrogon ions. And the 
most familiar kind of sequence that you w ill see over and over aga in in b iology is the 
sequence you go  from, let's say, a methyl group to an alcohol w ith a hydroxyl to an 
aldehyde or a ketone w ith the double bond oxygen to a carboxyl group. 

You go one more step then  it's CO2. So going in this d irection it's an oxidation. If it's 
going in that direction the molecules are getting reduced. Just the same way that the 
cell and life have molecules that store energy in ATP, they also have an important 
molecule that stores electrons. And that molecule is known as NAD or nicotinamide 
adenine d inucleotide. NAD+. 

And its structure is, let's say a ribose, a  five carbon sugar. And it's got this entity on 
it. This is in your book so don't worry if you don't get the structure down. There's a 
positive charge on the nitrogen here. And it's joined through a diphosphate linkage 
to, guess what? Another molecule of adenosine. Here we find again a piece of a thing 
we find in RNA is now part of this system  for storing electrons. 

And the way this works is if you have two hydrogen atoms transferred  to here then 
this entity right here goes to this plus a hydrogen ion. And this we would know is 
NADH. I left out an oxygen here. Somebody p icked  it up. [LAUGHTER] Just too 
excited by the annua l Valentine's Day visit here. I wish the rest of you had a song for 
you,  too, but we didn't have time to set that up. So there's an important thing here, 
too, because actua lly a lot of energy is stored in there. 

This is a bundle of energy in this molecule that's actua lly about 50 kiloca lories per 
mole. And especially when we get to next week's lecture you'll see how cells go 
about extracting the energy out of that and making that energy into ATP, which  is 
sort of a universa l currency the cells can spend. Now, somebody asked about 
memoriz ing all of these structures I mean rea lly, As Julia says in her thing, we're 
trying to get you to focus on the concepts here. 

You won't have to memorize the structure of everything. It would be help ful if you 
recognized that glutamine and g lutamate are of the 20 amino acids, but we'll give 
you the structures and we'll g ive you the structures of something like NADH if you 
needed to do something w ith it. But the important thing is to remember that energy 
is stored in that high energy bond of ATP, that electrons are stored in this NADH, and 
they can be used in reactions that oxid ize or reduce. 

NAD and NADH can be used in reactions that remove or give electrons to 
biomolecules. Now, the same thing goes for what I'm about to tell you now because 
one of the first things that had to happen as  life evolved was there had to be some 
mechanism of getting energy made. And the reaction I'm going to tell you about  is 
called glycolysis. And it's a way of taking a molecule of glucose through a whole 
series of b iochemical transformations and to end up yielding -- -- two molecules of 
something that's known as pyruvate. 

And it also makes two molecules of ATP and two molecules of NADH. So it's a way 
that was invented in evolution of making ATP by carrying out a chemical 
transformation. And this is basica lly the same chemical transformation that we've 
been talking about that Lavoisier and Pasteur studied except that, as I'll show you, 
you do a little bit to convert it either to lactate or to ethanol. 

I'll get to that in a few minutes. Remember the point, a lso just to remind you, the 
reason I gave you that historical thing  is because what it turned out when people 
started out to study something, was winemaking of great interest to French 
scientists, was what they actually  learned was how cells made energy. And, in  fact, 
here we're looking at a sort of biochemica l fossil in a way because this pathway of 
glycolysis, which you'll see is kind of awkward. 

It's got ten different biochemical steps, it needs ten d ifferent enzymes, and what the 
cells got out of it is two molecules of ATP. But this system developed apparently way, 
way back in evolution before life forms got into these various Kingdoms because it's 
in virtua lly in every  living creature no matter what it is and it's essentially 
biochemica lly identical. Now,  it's possible we could go back nowadays and devise a 
better method, but once that something like that gets fixed in evolution, if something 
mutates to try and change it most of the time it's a disadvantage. 

And so  if something gets locked in, and this is true of many, many of these very 
complicated biochemica l pathways. So you won't have to remember all these 
structures I'm going to put on the board, but try and stay w ith me because I want to 
sort of show you one of these. This is probably the most ancient of these pathways. 
And it's still in a ll of us. It's in the bacteria in our guts. It's in the plants in the field. 

If you go out in the open ocean organisms still can carry out g lycolysis. So one thing, 
though, I want to try and put it in this way, if I came to you and said I've got the 
greatest idea. This is going to be how we're going to make energy and evolution as 
part of this entrepreneurship, I think you'd be right to be skeptical so I'll probably 
sort of tell you  in that way. So I've a lready shown you how to write glucose in a 
linear form, although I then told you that most of the time in solution it's cyclized 
into a pyranose ring, a six membered ring. 

But for the moment we can think of glucose as a stick. And I'll get you to just focus 
on the one position, the two position and the six position in that linear thing. If you 

look back at your notes you can see what the full structure of glucose looks like. But 
this is how the process of g lycolysis starts. This is if your body is going to take a 
molecule of glucose and make energy out of it,  this  is the first thing it does. 

It takes an ATP. It converts it to an ADP. It puts the phosphate down here to give 
glucose-6- phosphate. That's the only thing that changes. Isn't this just like most 
young entrepreneurs? Give them some venture capital. The first thing they do is 
spend it, buy a nice potted plant for the company they're build ing. It doesn't seem to 
be, if you want to make energy, starting out here spend ing energy is the first thing 
that the cell  is doing. 

It's using up an ADP, a lthough the overa ll goal is to make ATP. It then does a little 
shuffle, reverses the position of the double bond and the hydroxyl. This is an 
energetica lly something without much cost, but this sugar is different because this is 
now fructose-6-phosphate. It's got a little b it different arrangement of the doub le 
bond and the hydroxyl, but energetically it's pretty much the same thing. 

Then the next thing that happens the cells spends another molecule of ATP. It g ives 
now -- -- fructose-1,6, this is the sixth position, the one position to two position, 
1,6-diphosphate. It doesn't  look like we're on our way to make energy yet. Cells 
invested two molecules of ATP and what it's done is it's got this g lucose transformed 
to fructose 1,6-disphopshate. 

Well, what happens now then is the cell splits this into two three carbon units. There 
were six carbons in g lucose. Yeah? Well, it's a linear molecule. There's a phosphate 
here and a separate phosphate down there. They should be. Yeah. I'm probab ly 
dropping charges and hydroxyls, OK? But check your book if you notice something 
like that. So what we get -- What the cell gets out of this then are two three carbon 
units, one of which is this -- -- known as d ihydroxyacetone phosphate. 

And you can  find these names in your book. You don't have to, as I say, remember 
the structures. What I've done is basica lly taken this molecule and I've flipped it over 
so that the phosphate w ill be down. And you'll see why I've done that in a second. 
And from the bottom ha lf of the molecule then we get -- This is g lycereldahyde-3-
phosphate. So  this is three carbons. 

This is three carbons. This was six carbons. So the cell has sp lit it into these three 
carbon units that are very similarly related except where the doub le bond is. And 
there's an enzyme that actually cata lyzes the conversion of those two. It's a 
cata lytically perfect enzyme that goes. It's just limited by the rate of diffusion. And it 
can do something of the order of ten to the eighth molecules a second. 

It's a really, really efficient catalyst. So what happens then is this, since these are in 
equilibrium  the cell is going to now start to pull these -- This. But these will be 
converted into that and will be able to get here. So we're going to follow the fate 
then of these -- -- two g lycaraldahyde-3-phosphate molecules. Excuse me. Sorry. 
OK. Now, at this point the cell is at the aldehyde stage. 

And it's going to carry out an oxidation reaction. So it's going to take a couple of 
electrons away from here, and it's going to therefore be carrying out an oxidation. If 
the molecule is getting oxid ized something else has to be reduced. What's going to 
get reduced is NAD+. We'll need two molecules of that because we've got two 
molecules of g lyceraldehyde phosphate. 

So we end up with two molecules of NADH plus a hydrogen ion. And this is an 
energetica lly favorable reaction. So the cell is ab le to sneak a phosphate in and make 
a molecule and still have the reaction go forward, have a molecule that's not very 
stab le, but it can make it because the overall thing goes forward. And there are two 
of these. And what we have now is 1,3-phosphoglycerate. 

What the cell has basica lly managed to do is to get two phosphate groups very, very 
close together. So you're probab ly getting, hopefully, the concept that if you stick a 
bunch of negative charges together and hold them together that molecules, if you 
break one of those bonds are going to go energetica lly downhill. And you can do 
work. And the way it does that then  is in breaking this bond it uses it to make two 
molecules of ATP. 

So you've now got, this is up at the acid level or a carboxyl group. And we've got 
three phosphoglycerate. So at least from the point of view of this as a plan for 
making energy, we've now managed to get back those two ATPs we invested. So up 
until now we've got our, the venture capita l money we put in has be recovered, and 
we've got a couple of molecules of NADH out of it. But what the cell now does is 
finish, to carry out some more steps that let it make a couple more molecules of 
ATP. 

So the first step then is a kind of just a sw itcheroo between where this hydroxyl is 
and this phosphate  is. So it brings the phosphate up to here. As you might guess this 
is energetically not much of a change. However, what it does now is it enables the 
cell to eliminate a molecule of water from here so we get two molecules of water 
come out because we had a ll along here we're carrying on two molecules from up 
there because we have two of these three carbon units. 

Then the molecule that we then get here -- -- is this molecule which is known as 
phosphoenolpyruvate. And several of you are saying you don't remember much  from 
chemistry. So this is a keto group, which I know you were introduced to. But it's in 
an equilibrium w ith what's termed an enol form where you have an OH here, a 
double bond like that, and that's known as an enol. Now, this is energetically greatly 
disfavored. 

So norma lly most of the time you find something in a keto form, but occasiona lly you 
find it in an enol form. And what's happened here rea lly is the cell has trapped what 
would like to be a keto at this position in an enol form. Again, this is a very 
energetica lly unstab le molecule. You've got a ll these oxygens together, two of these, 
and so the cell is once again able to take ADP and make two molecules of ATP. 

And we end up with -- -- two molecules of pyruvate. And extraord inary amount of 
work. What do we get out of it? Well, we've got a total of four ATPs now p lus two 
NADHs. What d id we invest? Two ATPs. So the net yield from this reaction is two 
ATPs plus two NADHs. So strange as it seems this was one of the first sequences of 
biochemica l steps that were put together in a pathway that were capable of letting 
an organism generate molecules of ATP, or sort of form of energy money by 
metabolizing something it could find like a molecule of sugar. 

There are two enzymatic steps. That means that there has to be a separate enzyme 
for every step in the pathway. Now, the ATPs, as I sa id, have energy in bundles of 
about 12 kilocalories per mole. There's a lot of energy here in NADH. And in the next 

lecture I'm going to ta lk to you about resp iration, which is something you're aware 
of. You know we respire, but chemica lly what that we'll see means is basica lly it's a 
way of extracting the energy that's in the NADH by transferring electrons to oxygen. 

And that's a wonderful way to make energy. It's far more efficient than this ancient 
pathway, but at the time life started there wasn't any oxygen  in the environment. 
And, in  fact, it d idn't reach, as I said, I think  it was something like 20% of today's 
levels until we were about a half a billion years or so ago in evolution. So organisms 
had to learn to make energy without oxygen being around. 

And this was the way that they did it. And it was such a success in evolution that our 
bodies do it, the bacteria in our gut do it and just virtually all living forms. So it's sort 
of a b iochemica l fossil but it was so successful it took hold. It's sort of like legs. 
Those appeared in evolution. And there are a ll sorts of organisms now that use legs, 
and they've evolved into wings and everything, but it's all the same basic idea. 

You could imag ine a life form that started with wheels. And maybe  if it had been the 
first thing to do maybe there'd be some sort of organisms with wheels, but legs were 
such a success at some point that that's what got used and then evolution made 
various embellishments on  it. But there is a problem here. I don't know if anybody 
can see what it is. 

If I'm going to be ab le to use ATP to make energy and I want to keep generating 
more and more molecules of ATP so I can build stuff, I cannot give those electrons in 
NADH to oxygen. So what would happen if I just kept running this system? Anybody 
see what the problem would be? Yeah. You'd  run out of NADH, exactly. We need to 
somehow recycle that NAD so it can take place. If we could give it to oxygen, oxygen 
as I've told you in respiration,  that would be cool. 

But organisms d idn't have that option. And so they worked out ways of doing things 
with pyruvate. And this is where you'll see this coming together with what we ta lked 
about the other day. So  let's take those two molecules of pyruvate. And there are 
basically two strategies, two major strateg ies you find in nature. One is to take the 
two NADHs plus two hydrogen ions and convert it to two molecules of NAD+ so that 
regenerates it. 

And what do you get if you do that? You end up with this molecule. Two molecules of 
that which I introduced you to the other day. That's lactic acid or lactate, the 
organisms that make yogurt carry out. That's what they do. That's why yogurt goes 
sour. What the organisms are doing when they're making the yogurt that you had for 
lunch, I love those p ictures. I found them on the Web and put them in. 

What they're doing  really is they're getting rid of that NADH so that they can do 
another cycle and make more energy. Now, I mentioned  that this happens to us, 
too. And this happens in athletic events where you exercise rea lly, rea lly hard, you 
know, like sprints or speed skating or something like that. Because what happens is 
you're exercising so hard that you use up the oxygen in your muscles faster than 
your bloodstream can bring you more. 

So what you're doing is you're making your muscles go anaerob ic. It's like you're 
going back way, way in evolution when there's was no oxygen around. And your 
muscles have to keep working, so what they do, since there's no oxygen around, 
they stick it on pyruvate and you get lactic acid in your muscles. So if you go out for 

the track team in the spring and you haven't exercised and you run a whole lot of 
sprints and, God, your muscles are so sore, they're a ll full of lactic acid. 

So you don't have to worry about it accumulating in your muscles from eating 
yogurt, but it does show up in this kind of way. And the other thing then that the 
way nature has found to recycle these NADHs is to it this way, to carry out a 
transformation where you get two molecules of carbon dioxide and two molecules of 
acetaldehyde. And this can be converted to the two molecules of carbon dioxide and 
two molecules of ethanol. 

So this is the fermentation that we ta lked about. And so when those yeasts that we 
saw growing the other day are busy metaboliz ing sugar into ethanol and carbon 
dioxide, the reason they're doing it is they need to get energy to carry out all the 
biosynthetic reactions that they need to make more biomateria l. But what's 
happening to the whole system is that you're generating carbon dioxide and making 
stuff into ethanol. 

So it doesn't matter if people are making w ine or beer or something they're going to 
distil to make whiskey or brandy or something. It's all the basic thing. The yeast take 
the sugars, make it into carbon dioxide and to ethanol. But when you're making 
bread you're only really  interested in the carbon dioxide because those  little bubbles 
then expand when you heat it up and that's what makes bread rise. And that was an 
open  fermentation, as you can guess,  like  in making w ine. 

Peop le  like to have a closed system so that, for example, a lactic acid bacteria 
doesn't get in and turn your whole set of grapes into something that would be sour. 
Sour wine. So that's where we'll stop today, the most ancient of these energy-
producing things. Again, you don't have to memorize all this, but I think, hopefully if 
you think about, you'll see some rea lly, rea lly important concepts that are critical to 
understanding how life works. 

OK? See you on Wednesday. Happy Va lentine's Day.
