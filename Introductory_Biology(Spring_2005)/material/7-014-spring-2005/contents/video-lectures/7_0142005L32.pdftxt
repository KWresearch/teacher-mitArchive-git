Transcript â€“ Lecture 32 

So what I want to do today is recap a little bit what we ta lked about last time, 
reiterate some of the important points, and then show you how we can learn 
something about microorganisms in the environment by ta lking about in-situ 
identification of microorganisms as well as genomics. We'll first talk about genomics 
and general and then talk about some app lications of genomics to environmental 
microbiology because I think there is some of the most exciting new developments 
are in the area, actually. So last time we talked about molecular evolution and 
ecology. 

And just to recap, some of the main points were that we can actua lly use genes or 
gene sequences for a couple of very important questions that we want to explore. 
The first one was gene sequences act as evolutionary chronometers. Now, what do I 
mean by that? Basically what we said last time was that each gene, each sequence 
in the genome accumulates mutations with a certa in probability. So what we mean is 
that all genes accumulate mutations over time. Now, these of course are the 
mutations that do not kill the organisms, so not the deleterious mutations, but these 
are mutations that are either slightly deleterious, or don't matter, or are beneficia l 
mutations. 

OK, and what this enta ils is that each gene accumulates mutation w ith a certain 
probability over time. It basically means that two organisms that come from species 
that are relatively closely related to each other have gene sequences that will be 
much more similar to each other than genes from an organism that comes from a 
species that's much more d istantly related. So, in practical terms what this means is 
your genes are much, much more similar to those of a monkey than they are to a 
crocodile, for example. 

And we can take advantage of that by applying some algorithms, some mathematical 
modeling essentially, to constrain these relationships in those phylogenetic trees that 
we talked about last time. And I also mentioned that the ribosomal RNA genes are 
particularly important for that process. In principle, you could do it with any protein 
coding machine or any kind of gene in the genome, but we use the ribosomal RNA 
genes in particular because a ll organisms have them. They're part of a hand ful of 
genes that are what we ca lled universally distributed last time. And what this allows 
us to do is then construct phylogenetic relationships for a ll living organisms. 

And I just want to remind you of the tree of life that I showed you last time where 
we can really explore the relationships amongst all living organisms. And some of the 
important points there that we made were, for examp le, that the tree of life supports 
the endosymbiont theory, that when you actua lly look on the tree where the 
mitochondria and the chlorop lasts tree, they fa ll into the bacteria. Now, there is a 
question where somebody asked in the online survey, can the mitochondria and 
chloroplasts still live outside of the eukaryotic cell? And the answer is no, they can't 
anymore because over evolutionary time the two organisms have become so 
integrated that the mitochondria and chloroplasts both lost their ability to live 
outside of the eukaryotic host cell. 

Another important point that we made last time that I want to reiterate here is that 
gene sequences, when we go into the environment, and obtain them d irectly from 
the environment act as a proxy for microbial diversity in the environment. So, the 
number of genes recovered directly from the environment is a measure of diversity. 

And we said that this actually plays a very, very important role in the analysis of 
microbia l communities, and I showed you the example here where we went and took 
some ocean water and basica lly apply this technique that outlined last time where 
we can actually amplify ribosoma l RNA genes from environmenta l samples, clone 
them, determine the sequence, and then constructs phylogenetic trees. And what 
you see here is a tree where we summarize the major groups that we found in the 
samp le have been only for two of those groups where we show the entire set of 
sequences that we actually obtained because there were so many of them out there. 

And what we basica lly found was that over 1500 bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene 
sequences coexist in this environment. And what we sa id a lso last time was that the 
analyses like these have rea lly taught us that microorganisms are the most d iverse 
organisms on the planet. So, most diversity is amongst the microorganisms, and one 
of the big questions now is what are a ll those microorganisms doing in the 
environment? And so, today what I want to do with you is basically exp lore this 
question of how we can actually figure out what those microorganisms are all doing 
in environmenta l samples? So we can say we are exploring the function of microbes 
in the environment. 

At first, I want to cover how we can actua lly identify them in the environment. And I 
want to show you one specific example, and  then I want to talk about genomics in 
general, and then basica lly end w ith an app lication of genomics to environmenta l 
questions. So, let's first talk about the in-situ identification of microorganisms. And 
the basic problem  that I a lluded to a lready before is that most microbes are only 
known [SOUND OFF/THEN ON] -- from 16S ribosomal RNA clone  libraries. 

And we basically want to search and identify them in the environment. OK, and I'll 
show you a specific example of that later on. Now last time, we sa id that the 
ribosomal RNA sequences consist rea lly, like a ll gene sequences, in  fact. We 
identified several stretches of nucleotides, types of stretches, that can be found. We 
said the A type stretches and B type stretches that are very important for 
construction of phylogenetic relationships, because we can align them and look for 
changes in the nucleotide sequences because they are the same length and only 
differ in mutation and sing le nucleotide base pair changes. But then there's a lso 
those C type stretches, if you remember, and those we said vary at much faster 
rates because they are not functionally constra ined in those genes. 

OK, so  they can actua lly a lso accumulate length changes. And, it's these C type 
stretches that we can use sort of as diagnostic sequence stretches for 
microorganisms. So, what we can say is we identify organisms by the C type 
stretches, C type sequence stretches. And we ca ll those signature sequences. 

OK, and they a llow the d ifferentiation of closely related organisms, -- because they 
vary at very fast rates between organisms. And the way we do  this is that we 
construct so-called phylogenetic probes. I should probably write this over here. Now 
what are those phylogenetic probes? They're basically short p ieces of DNA that have 

a fluorescent molecule attached to them. -- DNA molecules that are roughly 20 
nucleotides in length, and they carry a florescent molecule. 

Now what the short, single-stranded stretches of DNA basically are is they are 
complementary to those C type sequence stretches -- -- in the ribosoma l RNA. And 
so basica lly what we can do is we can collect microbia l cells from the environment --
-- make them permeable -- -- and then basically mix them w ith those phylogenetic 
probes. And these probes will then permeate  into the cell and b ind to their 
complementary sequences. 

Then we wash away the unbound probe -- -- and we can view it in a microscope 
under UV light. Let me show you an example of this. What you see here is basica lly a 
light micrograph. So this is what you see basically when you collect microb ial cells 
from the environment under the microscope. Most bacteria look the same, so you 
cannot actua lly d ifferentiate them a ll by just looking at them. But then these cells 
were fixed and permeab ilized and then basica lly mixed with two different 
phylogenetic probes that identified two d ifferent types of organisms. One was labeled 
with a red Fluor, the other one w ith a green Fluor. And what you see is that you can 
now d ifferentiate those two organisms. 

Now, why  is this especially interesting? Well here's just a specific example where 
people were looking for bacteria capable of nitrogen oxidation. These are bacteria 
that are very important in,  for examp le, sewage treatment. And it was known that 
there were two d ifferent types out there, one that oxid izes ammonia to nitrite, -- and 
that a second one that oxid izes nitrite to nitrate. 

And by doing this type of ana lysis what people basically learned is that those two 
organisms live in very, very close proximity at all times. So the organisms that 
oxid ized ammonia to nitrite are rea lly attached, and oftentimes even surround by the 
organisms that take the nitrite to nitrate. So, where you have is a very close 
cooperation between two d ifferent types of microorganisms, and the transfer of one 
of the substrates that's a product of the metabolism of one of the organisms to 
another one: so extremely efficient process that rea lly is very important to take into 
consideration when you want to understand processes  like sewer treatment, but also 
nitrogen biogeochemistry and the environment. Any questions? OK, so for the 
rema inder of the lecture I want to ta lk about genomics, -- and then in particular also 
its app lication to questions of environmenta l microbiology and environmental 
science. 

So first, what I want to do is g ive you a little b it of the definition of genomics, and 
then cover how it is actually possible that we can sequence entire genomes, and I 
want to give you some highlights of what we have found by comparing d ifferent 
genomes to each other. And then I want to talk about this field about environmental 
genomics where we can use genomic techniques to actually learn something about 
the function of different uncultured microorganisms in the environment. So first, our 
definition, it's basica lly to interpret or to sequence, -- interpret, and compare whole 
genomes. 

And as you will see the comparison part actually plays an  increasingly important role 
because we have now actually genome sequences available from a lmost all, or from 
at least some of the major groups of life. So this, again, is a different kind of 
representation of the tree of life. You have bacteria, archaea, and eukarya again. 
And as you can see, we have a lot of representatives. In fact, this doesn't even come 

close to the d iversity that we have now sequenced as well over a hundred bacteria l 
genome sequence now, several archeael genomes, and increasingly also in 
eukaryotic genomes. Now, genomes, so how is this done? How can we actua lly 
sequence genomes? Well, on the face of it we use very large facilities where you 
have sequencing machines present. 

There's one very important one at MIT, actua lly at the Broad Institute, and here you 
see all those rea lly industrial scale production lines actually. But the basic problem  is 
that genomes are large. E. coli, for examp le, has roughly 4.4 million base pa irs, and 
the human genome is even much, much larger. It has about 3 b illion base pa irs. 

OK, so genomes are very, very large. But a sing le sequencing  reaction-- -- gives you 
only roughly 500-1,000 nucleotides or base pairs. So how is  it that we can actua lly 
sequence entire genomes? I'm going to wa lk you through this, and there is some 
variation on the theme, but this is still a major approach that's still used in some of 
the sequencing facilities. Now, you start out by extracting genomic DNA from 
organisms, and then you use restriction enzymes to cut the DNA into relatively large 
pieces of DNA, so about 160 kilobase pairs  long. On average, this is shown here. 

Kilo means a thousand, so 160,000 base pa irs long. These p ieces are then cloned 
into specific cloning vectors that are ca lled BAC vectors. So therefore, cloning large 
pieces of DNA, and BAC stands for Bacterial Artificia l Chromosome. And what they 
basically are, are plasmids, very specia l p lasmids that can carry large p ieces of 
genome, or large genome fragments. So, by cloning into those BAC vectors, what 
you do is you basica lly divide up the genome, and then the step number three is 
mostly done for eukaryotic genomes because they are so much larger. 

You can actua lly map and analyze the fragments, and map them onto genome maps 
where you know the location of different restriction fragments and different genes, 
actually. For bacteria, this step is mostly skipped, actua lly. What you do w ith each 
one of those BACs, is you cut them further up into 1 kilobase per fragment, so much 
sma ller fragments. And these are called, and these are cloned then into norma l 
plasmid vectors. And so you generate what are called shotgun clones. 

So, these are then cloned into E. coli, you go through the same type of steps that we 
discussed before already w ith environmental clone libraries. And you can actually 
determine the sequence of each one of those pieces of DNA. And what you will then 
get, is small fragments of overlapping DNA sequences. That it shown here. You'll find 
overlaps, basica lly, which p iece together the whole genome. And so,  first to 
assemble, you piece together these genome fragments that are present in the BACs, 
and then finally you p iece together the entire genome propose large sequence 
pieces, and you get a so-ca lled draft genome sequence. The next step in this 
analysis,  then, is that you do so-called genome annotation is. 

And the first very important step is that you translate the gene sequences  into amino 
acids. So, the nucleotide sequences into amino acids particularly  in prokaryotes. This 
step can be done right away -- -- and what this allows you to do, is you can look for 
what we call open reading frames, or ORFs. And what you  look for is a start codon 
and a stop codon that basically branches or frames a stretch of amino acids encoded 
by the nucleotides. So you look for ORFs. And these are your putative genes. 

The next step that you can do, then, is you can go to databases and now you 
compare your ORFs to information that is present in the databases. So basically, you 

inquire the database and ask, is a gene sequence that is similar to the one that I 
have statistically significantly similar present that a llows me to say something about 
the function of this particular gene? So  function, can then be identified by 
comparison with databases. Any questions? OK, so that allows you, then, to basica lly 
say something about the d ifferent genes that you have found in the genome, but to 
give you an impression of how new this field rea lly is and how little we still know 
about the diversity of genes and organisms, on average when we sequence a new 
bacteria l genome we find about 30% of the genes, or a third of the genes have no 
known functional ana log of the databases. 

OK, so  there's a lot to learn about the diversity of life and about the functional 
diversity of  life. 

In eukaryotes, there are some little twists, as you all know. And basically, that is 
that genes of course consist of introns and exons, right? And so it's basica lly 
relatively difficult to d irectly identify those open reading  frames. And what you have 
to do is that you have to actua lly oftentimes, so let's write this down. And what 
people oftentimes do, then, is that they search for matching sequences in so-ca lled 
cDNA  libraries. 

Now what are cDNA  libraries? Let me just show you this on the next slide. Skip this. 
Basica lly what you can do is you can isolate messenger RNA from cells and that 
translate the messenger RNA by a process ca lled reverse transcription that the viral 
enzyme that translates RNA  into DNA, so you can translate it  into DNA fragments. 
And you can then clone those DNA fragments into p lasmids, sequence those, and 
then basica lly see what are the pieces that are actually, what are the introns in the 
genes? What are the p ieces that are excised when the messenger RNA is actually 
created from the genome? And so, let me just cover now a few of the major insights 
that people have come up w ith. 

Of course, it's a very grow ing field and a lot of excitement is coming out. And I first 
want to ta lk about bacteria and archaea -- -- and then say a  few words also about 
eukaryotes or eukaryote. F irst of all, what we learned about, bacteria and archaea, is 
that their genomes are very compact. Whenever they have pieces of DNA that are 
not frequently used, they're actua lly lost from the genome. 

OK, so  they lose genes, I should say, relatively easily, and we can see this that the 
genome size is correlated to metabolic diversity. So, for example, we have 
Mycoplasma geneta lium and Streptomyces -- coelicor are two very d ifferent bacteria. 
The first one is an ob ligate intracellular parasite. OK, so, which means it's actua lly 
bathed in a nutrient solution in the eukaryotic cells that it invades. 

It doesn't have to make amino acids. It gets it just from the host cell. And it turns 
out it has a very sma ll genome, so only 0.58-based mega-base pairs, so 580,000 
base pa irs, and only 517 genes. And interestingly, actually peop le are now using this 
organism to try and ask, well, what's the minimum number of genes that organism 
can actua lly will live with? And so, they are deleting in a stepwise fashion the 
different genes in this organism, and it turns out that you need about two to 300 
genes minimum  in order to make the things survive. On the other hand, 
streptomyces is a soil bacterium -- -- has a very comp lex lifestyle, can degrade a lot 
of environmenta l substrates, and it has a very b ig genome, one of the biggest 
bacteria l genomes. 

And so, those two organisms basica lly span pretty much the range of bacterial 
genome sizes. And so, it's thought that it has about 7,846 genes. Now, we also have 
a very large genetic diversity -- -- between species. And typ ica lly what you  find  is 
that roughly 15 to 30% of genes are unique to a specific species. And that's rea lly 
because bacteria and archaea have the capability to affect a lot of chemica l reactions 
that eukaryotes, for example, cannot. 

There's about 20 million known organic substances, organic chemicals, and almost all 
of them are biodegradable by bacteria. Even the minutest compounds  if it were not 
biodegradab le bacteria, would build up in the environment, OK? So, if it just where a 
cofactor that some organism produces because we have such a long period of time of 
evolution on this planet and evolutionary history, you probably would be able to dig 
it up in your backyard. One of the other very important and interesting insights that 
has come out with comparing genomes for microorganisms is that lateral gene 
transfer is a very important process amongst microorganisms. 

Now what do I mean by lateral gene transfer? It basica lly means that we find 
evidence among bacteria l genomes that they have actually taken genes from 
completely unrelated organisms. And I just want to show you one example here from 
that of thermotoga maritima -- -- which lives in hot springs. 

This is a very interesting bacterium that lives in hot water of around 80Â°C and 
thrives only in those kinds of environments. And they coexist there w ith many 
archaea. And when peop le sequenced the genome of thermotoga maritima what they 
found was that about 25% of the genes have their closest relatives  in archaea l 
genomes. So roughly 25% of genes in thermotoga are of archaea l origin. And how 
can we actually figure something like that out? Well, the most important technique 
is, again, phylogenetic tree construction. 

And so when you have,  for examp le, gene A, well let me draw this, actually, on a 
new board. So you're comparing, say, three organisms, organism A, B, and C and 
you compare gene one w ith gene two. And you notice that most genes adhere to this 
pattern, but that every now and then there's a gene that gives you this type of 
pattern. What you can then conclude is that this gene, C, has not coevolved w ith the 
other genes in the genome of these organisms but was actua lly transferred into it 
from another source. 

And I don't have time to go actually into the mechanisms. If you're interested, I 
teach a graduate class that undergraduates actually take in our department, 
environmental microbiology, where we discussed a lot of the mechanisms. It's 
basically a lot of viruses can affect gene transfer but also p lasmids and transposons. 

But for bacteria, aga in, you should remember that often new function is actually 
oftentimes arises by lateral gene transfer. And one of the interesting things is that 
latera l gene transfer is actually very important in the evolution of pathogenic 
bacteria. So, the so-ca lled virulence genes, which are the genes that basically affect 
pathogenesis. Do you have a question? Among pathogenic bacteria, often arise by 
latera l gene transfer. 

OK. Any questions? OK, now for eukarya, I just want to make the point that their 
genomes are genera lly orders of magnitudes larger -- OK, and that the exons, so the 
stretches that really encode the protein that make up the organism, the exons are 
only typ ically a few percent of the genome. That's particularly in higher eukaryotes. 

Yeasts,  for examp le, have a much more compact genome a lso. We, for example, are 
full of DNA that peop le still have a very hard time figuring out what that actually 
does. But it seems that the majority of the genome, so-called  repeated sequences --
-- many of which seems to be ancient retroviruses that have inserted themselves 
into  the genome and have since then lost actually their function. 

OK, so  the rema ining time I want to just give you an example of how we can now 
use these techniques that I outlined before to learn something about microorganisms 
in the environment. It's called environmental. Basically, the way this a ll started was 
by going into the environment and extracting nuclear gases and treating them 
exactly the same way as  if you had a single genome. But, again, remember, we have 
a very large mixture of microorganisms present  in the environment. And where this 
is mostly done was in the ocean, actua lly. And what people d id, was they constructed 
those BAC clones directly from the environment and then looked amongst those BAC 
clones for specific 16S ribosoma l RNA genes. Remember, this is the marker that we 
have for microorganisms in the environment. 

We know the diversity of microorganisms through those types of genes, and we have 
a lot of the data available. And so,  in order to link a specific function of such an 
organism that we only know from the 16S ribosomal RNA genes. So, to ask the 
question of what much of this organism might be carrying out in the environment, 
it's very useful to sequence BAC clones that have 16S ribosomal RNA genes on them, 
and determine what kinds of protein coding genes are on there that might reveal 
some of the function of the organism in the environment. And one example that I 
want to show you is that of the proteorhodopsin. So basically, the initial task was to 
sequence BAC clones containing  ribosomal RNA genes, and look for other genes that 
might revea l some of the function. 

So, you don't want to look for all the genes that encode proteins that are  important 
to the cell cycle and things like that, but rea lly sort of metabolic genes that might tell 
you something about the type of metabolism that this organism carries out in the 
environment. And so, what the first examp le that turned out to be rea lly, rea lly 
important is that people found rhodopsin genes on one of those BAC  fragments, and 
it turns out this rhodopsin catalyzes or these rhodopsin genes produce a protein that 
inserts itself into  the bacteria l membrane, and it's a photoreceptor that when it's hit 
by light, it actually becomes a proton pump. 

So, it expels protons from the cell interior to the outside, and you a lready know that 
this is important in energy generation in all living cells. So proton grad ient across 
membranes basically g ive the cells sort of a battery status that can be exploited by 
ATPase molecules or ATPase proteins that equalize the proton gradient and affect 
ATP synthesis in doing so. Now, why is this so important? Well, it turned out that this 
type of protein is present in almost all microbia l cells that were previously thought to 
be heterotrophs alone in the ocean  in the parts of the ocean that receive enough life. 

And what this means is that our estimates of the g loba l carbon budget of the ocean 
were basically wrong because most microorganisms in the ocean have this. So most 
prokaryotes in the ocean have a light-driven proton pump which is ca lled 
proteorhodopsin. 

And it basically allows them to gain energy from sunlight. And there's an increasing 
number of such examples now where we are  learning to interpret environmenta l 
communities, and the function of environmenta l microb ial communities through 

those genomic approaches. And it revea ls basica lly an enormous diversity of 
organisms out there. And what we also are learning to do now is to assemb le entire 
genomes from those samp les by app lying genomic techniques. And this is an 
example here where you see, this was pub lished last year, where people went out 
and basically were ab le to p iece together from p ieces of genes obtained  from the 
environment, entire genomes or fragments of entire genomes. 

And that's shown here. Those are contiguous sequences. OK, so if you have any 
questions let me know by e-mail, or if you're interested in pursuing this further I also 
teach another class in civil and environmenta l engineering.
