Transcript â€“ Lecture 27 

There was a little confusion with dideoxies in one sense, and some of these things 
like the PCR you're going to have to sort of sit down and actually think about it, but 
the principle of the dideoxies, if we were making a cha in of beads that had a hook on 
one end and a little hole on the other, and we were joining these things together, we 
could make obviously, a cha in that went on. And then we could hook another one in, 
and so on. And if we had a bunch of beads like this every now and then we threw in 
a very sma ll number that d idn't have the hook on the end, any time this particular 
cha in were elongating and we put on one of these things, the chain would stop 
because you haven't got any where to join onto it. 

You added d ideoxy into a polymerase reaction. A cha in that gets the d ideoxy doesn't 
have anything to join  in the end, and that will stop. If we only added this, the entire 
reaction would stop, and everyone would come at the first time a d ideoxy got 
incorporated. 

The trick  is to put a little bit in. So, a few of the molecules stop. Everything keeps 
going. The next time a dideoxy gets incorporated, the cha in will stop there. And out 
of this, you w ill generate a family of polymers that are of different lengths. Each one 
will terminate w ith a dideoxy nucleotide, and if the dideoxy nucleotide we used in 
that particular reaction was, let's say, dideoxy ATP, that means that an A was the 
last nucleotide added to every one of those. And we can separate these on the basis 
of size. And if I ran them out on a gel, I'd see something like that. 

And that would tell me that when that polymerase was coming along, that was the 
first time it saw an A. A few stopped there, polymerized a few more. Then it put in 
another A, put in some other things, and so on. And that by itself wouldn't tell us the 
sequence. But if I d id that reaction four times in a row, then I could tell. In the old 
days,  they didn't used to use dyes. 

We just d id P32 on it as a label, and then you'd  run the four reactions side-by-side. 
And this would be w ith d ideoxy ATP. You'd see a pattern like that, and maybe with 
dideoxy TTP, you'd see something like this. And when you got the rest of them, 
you'd kind of end up working out what the sequence was by  looking across the four 
lanes. This business of using the dye is just one more step up in the eng ineering side 
that enables the thing to be done automatica lly. And  it's pretty well expla ined in your 
textbooks. 

OK, PCR, someone was confused as to why we d idn't just let the cell do it. Well, the 
cell does a great job, but if you are a molecular biolog ist trying to understand the 
basis of life or if you're a biolog ica l engineer, and you want to produce something, 
you need to get hold of a particular p iece of DNA. Or, if you're a forensic 
investigator, and you've got a tiny, tiny sample of human DNA, and you want to 
know whose it is, you have to make more of it. And, that's what PCR is all about. 

So I'm going to sw itch just over to the net for a minute. I think this first site, I just 
want to show you something, how somebody functions in a lab now with a ll these 

genes out there. And then, I'm going to show you a little animation for PCR that will 
help. So, if you just go to Goog le and type NCBI, that's the Nationa l Center for 
Biotechnology Information. And, the Dolan Learning Center is a center that Cold 
Spring Harbor Laboratory has set up to teach people about DNA. 

So let me just see here. So, let's just go to, OK, let's use, whoops, this is going to 
seize on us. OK, let's find how it happens. OK, so here's this National Center for 
Biotechnology Information. There's all sorts of things you can search for, and I'm not 
expecting you to know  the site. I just want to sort of g ive you a demo. If I was 
sitting in my office, this is the sort of thing I can do easily. Rather than sequence 
looking  for DNA sequence, I'm going to look for the translated sequence of the 
protein that's encoded by the gene where the computer's gone through and used the 
genetic codes tell me the sequence of a protein. I told you about sequencing a 
mismatch repair gene back in the 80s. It was ca lled MutS, and I'll put in Walker GC, 
and probably hopefully get us to the thing. And there, the very first hit is DNA repair. 

Protein MutS salmonella typhimurium, that's the one I sequenced. So I'll just go to 
that. It has various ways of displaying the sequence. I'm going to sw itch to Fasta, 
which is a very easy way to see it. Now what you see is the sequence of the protein 
using a one letter code, or one letter stands for each amino acid. K is lysine. A is 
alanine, and so on. I'm just going to copy that, that p iece of sequence. OK so that's 
the bacteria l gene for mismatch repa ir. 

At the time I put that in the database, there wasn't anything else like it, except for 
the gene that was Streptococcus pneumonia. But I found out, someone else is 
sequencing by phoning around in the field. I'm going to go back to the main site and 
I'm going to use a program called Blast, which lets you search the entire database. 
I'll use a protein b last. I'm going to take a protein sequence, and I'm going to ask 
what else is out there in terms of protein sequences? I'll paste in this bacterial 
sequence, and then I'm going to, if I can, manage this thing. 

Let's see if I can get myself down here. OK, over here I'll probably do, OK, so I'm 
going to limit it, let's just search the human genome. That's a ll we've got to do. And 
what did I have to do to get this thing to fit? Which button? Go to the right. Can you 
just come up here for a second to help me get this set up? I'm computer limited here 
apparently. OK, that one, OK, great, so why do we not try this aga in? PAUSE] Sorry 
about this. 

We'll see if we can get this thing to go. I have what? Yeah, that's OK though. That 
should be fine. Try again. Let's see if I can get the thing to work. OK, so it's got it 
now. It'll tell me. It's searching a ll the sequence that's out there. There's just an 
unbelievable amount of sequence. That's just how long it took. It's show ing me here 
a diagrammatic representation of the things. Then I can see that the very first it was 
MutS homolog three for humans. And if I go down here, we can actua lly see on 
alignment of the bacterial gene on the top line, and the lines below is the sequence 
of that particular human homolog. And you can see in between a ll the things that are 
in common, and particularly down at the C-terminus of the protein, you can see 
there's very strong conservation. 

You may not think that that's impressive, but remember for every one of those 
positions, there's 20 possibilities. So, if you get that many in a row,  that's the same 
gene basica lly. And when you take the structure, the structure's going to be very, 
very similar. And it does mismatch repair in both. 

Just to try and give you an idea of how you do sequence now, because w ith all these 
genomes done, you do the vast majority of it by computer, rather than some other 
way. I want to take you and show you this. DNA learning: if you go there, the 
second thing is a set of animations. Go to the animations. There's one on polymerase 
cha in reaction. And, I'm going to just show you this because this is a nice little, let's 
see if we can get this thing to center. OK we'll have to see whether this is going to 
work. OK, so this is the principle of, you can go do this at your leisure, but the idea 
is to heat the DNA up,  the strands come apart. Then, were going to take these two 
little primers, not promoters, which I think someone was confused about, a little 
piece of DNA that complimentary, and annea l them. 

Than we added DNA polymerase. You know what happens then. We extend those 
primers. That was the first cycle. Do the same thing again. Go to the second cycle. 
This is what I was drawing on the board the other day. Now are going to denature 
the DNA. The strands come apart. Let's let the polymerase extend them. Let's go  to 
the third cycle, denature the DNA, annea l the primers, extend the primers, and now 
for the first time, we've got what we were shooting for. We have a double-stranded 
copy of just the DNA that was defined between those primers. 

OK, I think this actually, I'm going to go back one. Oops, OK. If you go, then, to the 
amplification graph, what they're doing here is they're showing you what happens as 
you do successive cycles. So, at the first, oh, it's down here. Just a minute. If we do 
the first cycle, we end up w ith two DNA copies. That's just p lotting what I showed 
you. The next one: we have four. We haven't yet got to this target sequence. By the 
next cycle, we now have two copies of the target sequence p lus these other things. 

But if you keep going, let's say by the time we're at seven cycles, the number of 
targets is up to 114. The number of DNA copies  is 128. But, if we keep going like 
this, we'll find out that the target cop ies become the vast majority of the sequences 
that are  in there. So, by the time that you're up  in the 30 cycles, or something like 
that, there's only a handful of the original things, or almost all, and that, I hope will 
help some of you who might have had problems with understand ing the PCR. So, 
what I'm going to do is tell you a few more things about what you can do w ith 
recombinant DNA, this recombinant DNA technology, because it's just so powerful. 

And I can only sort of g ive you a few ideas, and show you a few variations. But, 
most of these things are just taking principles that you've already learned as part of 
the basic biology I'm trying to tell you, and then using them like an engineer to 
achieve some app lied purpose. For example suppose I wanted to produce a human 
protein, and try and produce it in a bacterium. 

That would be great. I could take the one gene. I could grow a  fermenter load of E. 
coli, and if I got it right,  then I'd be ab le to make a  lot of this protein instead of 
trying to isolate it from some human source or something like that. There's a couple 
of problems. We talked about them. One is the problem of promoters. Another one is 
that human DNA would have introns in it. 

And, bacteria doesn't recognize the human promoters. It wouldn't start to make an 
RNA in the right place, and it doesn't know what to do about sp licing out the intron. 
So, let's address the intron  first. There is a way of hand ling that that's quite easy. 
And that's what's ca lled to make cDNA library. So, if we have DNA, and then we get 
the RNA, we get the RNA copy [SOUND OFF/THEN ON] including these  intron 

sequences. And then what happens, this is RNA splicing that we ta lked about. And 
what we get out of that would be an mRNA, in which the introns have been removed. 
So, eukaryotic cells, my cells, know how to express the gene, so they make the RNA, 
they know how to get rid of the  introns. 

So, if I were to isolate a messenger RNA. That's been sp liced from me, or you, or 
anything, what we would have is a population of RNA molecules that don't have 
introns anymore. Anybody remember any way we could get from RNA back to DNA? 
Reverse transcriptase. So, if we used reverse transcriptase, that protein that David 
Baltimore discovered and viruses, and which retroviruses use, now we would have a 
signle stranded DNA copy of the mRNA. And then, we could use an ordinary DNA 
polymerase to get ourselves to double-stranded DNA. 

We'd be doing, in essence, exactly what one of these retroviruses does. This would 
give us what's known as a cDNA library, where the genes don't have introns 
anymore. So, if I wanted to get at one of my proteins, one of my genes, and think 
about expressing it in E. coli, what I would do is go looking in a cDNA library using a 
sort of approach as we've done, trying to find my gene of interest, because if I use 
the cDNA library now it would just be like a bacterial gene. You could see the ATG 
start. 

You could get out your handy little genetic code, and you could wa lk along, and read 
out the sequence of the protein. So, that's part of what you need to do if you wanted 
to make, say, a protein inside of a bacterium. The other one which we talked about 
was since the promoters are not a universa l language, what E. coli RNA polymerase 
sees is d ifferent than what human RNA polymerase sees as a start site. I would have 
to add in a promoter that would drive the expression of this open reading frame if I 
wanted it to work in E. 

coli. And  that's fairly easily done, too. A general thing that's for this is ca lled 
expression cloning. And it would be more or less the same idea. We'd have a vector 
that had a cloning site. It has an origin of rep lication, and maybe there's a selectab le 
marker such as the drug resistance. That's the basic kind of factor that I ta lked 
about before. However, if I clone in a piece of DNA into that, it has to have a 
promoter that can be read in the organism working w ith, because it's just out 
whatever nature gave  it, whatever promoter that would be in front of that. But, if I 
were to now into this vector put an E. 

coli promoter right there, now,  if I just downstream of that put any open read ing 
frame, human protein lets say, which we've gotten rid of the introns, the human 
genes minus its introns, which you got from the cDNA  library, now when the 
bacteria l polymerase came along, it would be copying, making it a messenger RNA 
for human protein, and we could get it out of that. And the beauty of that, suppose 
we took the front part of the Lac operator, we would have a  regulated promoter. 

It would be just everything we stud ied about Lac if we were to starve it for, you 
know, we have to get rid of glucose, and then if we added lactose or some kind of 
synthetic inducer, we can turn the promoter on and off. So, you could grow an entire 
fermenter load of bacteria w ithout expressing the gene. And then, once you had the 
bacteria all grown up, you could throw in something that would norma lly induce the 
expression of the Lac regulatory system. And now, instead of making beta 
galactosidase, instead it would make the protein that you are interested in, you with 
me? It's very pretty. 

And in  fact, so much of what you can see in this is, these really basic studies, since 
the Lac system was one of the first to rea lly be worked out in detail, we use its parts. 
And, there are many vectors around now that have exactly that. They have the Lac 
promoter, and you can turn things on and off in a regulated way, so not only provide 
a promoter that works in the organism, but  it also gives you a measure of control. 

There's another very cute trick, and what we've done sort of here is we took, say, 
the promoter for Lac in the regulatory region. I'll use R to stand for regulatory 
region, and then this would be the LacZ sequence. What we've rea lly done, is we've 
taken a gene from somewhere else, let's ca ll it gene X that had a promoter from 
gene X. And, in essence, is cutting each of them here. And, now we take the 
regulatory promoter reg ion  from Lac and we put down below it gene X. And, now 
we've got this gene whose products we're interested in producing in a fermenter 
under the control of the Lac operon. Well, there's another kind of thing we can do. 

We can do the other way around. We could take LacZ, which makes beta 
galactosidase. We could put it under the promoter regulatory region of gene X. Well, 
what will happen then? If that construct  is sitting in a cell, anytime that the cell 
decides to make gene X, instead it will make beta galactosidase, which is really easy 
to assay for. And, this sort of strategy, you'd use something like LacZ as a  reporter. 
In this case beta galactosidase synthesis, which you can assay for, reports when is 
the promoter of gene X  is functioning. 

This reporter gene now has the regulatory characteristics that are imposed upon it 
by that particular promoter. So, there's this p icture that I've showed you, this little 
movie I showed you early on. You've seen  it a couple of times. In this case, the 
reporter is green fluorescent protein. What Barbara Meyer, who made this particular 
construct, did was they took the gene for green  florescent protein which started out 
in a jellyfish as you may remember. And,  the protein  folds up, and ends up being 
fluorescent. 

So, we can tell when it's expressed very easily. And in this case, you'll notice not all 
of the genes  in the whole worm isn't glow ing. And so, it's under the control of the 
promoter regulatory reg ion that is expressed only in specific body parts. And so, you 
can see where that promoter is working by just looking at the worm. In the case of 
something like the mouse that we talked about, it's a pretty uniform expression at 
least in the skin. So, that was probably, in that case, the green fluorescent protein 
was probab ly put in a promoter that's expressed in probably most of the cells in the 
body, at least certainly all the ones in the mouse cell. I don't know the deta ils of 
that. D itto over here. It was probab ly something that was expressed in most of the 
body cells, but you also could have put something that was just expressed in some 
very little b its. 

So, depend ing on how you do the construct,  there are a lot of different things that 
people can do in this sort of thing. OK, one more category that comes out of the sort 
of thing, is if we have a gene of some type, I don't know what it does but I'd like to 
find out. You know, at  least budd ing geneticists, know what we'd like to do. 

We'd probably just like to d isab le that gene very specifically, and then look at the 
live organism to see what happens. And,  the princip le is the same whether you're 
doing it  in E. coli or a mouse. It gets a little more complicated for technical reasons 
doing it  in a mouse. But the idea is exactly the same. And here's the strategy. So, 

we'll just take a p iece of DNA from the organism. And sitting at here  is this open 
reading  frame that we've seen. We don't know what its function is. We think if I 
could knock it out, get rid of its function, I'll  look at the organism. Maybe I can make 
a guess then. So, if we were to cut the gene somewhere with a restriction site, and 
then we were to take, for example, a gene encoding a drug resistance or something 
like that, and insert  it at that point, what we would end up w ith  is this p iece of the 
organism's DNA. The first part of gene X, then a drug resistance, then the last part 
of gene X, and some more sequence from the organism. 

Now, this would be, we'd have this in a  test tube. We could do it by the kind of 
recombinant DNA manipulations that we have. And what would happen if I were to 
put, now,  let's keep it with bacteria where it's easy to see. If I were to take that 
piece of DNA, put it inside a living cell, what's going to happen? Well, let's make this, 
say, here's the end of  it. 

That's all we've got. Well, inside the living cell, we of course have the entire genome. 
And then we come to this part. We have gene X. Then we'd have this going. That 
would be the whole thing. Well, this particular p iece doesn't have an orig in of 
replication. It's not joined to a vector. It's just sitting there. So, if the cell divides, it's 
not going to get rep licated. So, if I select for a drug  resistance that's on that piece of 
DNA, unless something happens I'm not going to get a drug-resistant bacteria. But 
you do know a way that this thing could join to an origin of replication. It could join 
to the origin of replication that's on the bacteria chromosome. 

And, the way to do it would be by undergoing genetic recomb ination over here, 
because this DNA is exactly the same as on that side, and over here it's the same 
thing. This DNA is the same as that side. So, if that genetic exchange happened, 
what would happen, even if it happened  rarely, was this piece of DNA would replace 
the p iece of DNA that's in there. I'd be able to tell it was there because I'd just select 
for drug  resistance. 

And even if it only happened only one in 500,000 cells, it wouldn't matter because up 
would growth the colony that now has the drug in the midd le of gene X. Gene X is 
gone, and I could look at the organism  if it's a live and see if it has a phenotype. If 
it's an essential gene, that strategy obviously won't work, and when people do the 
more complicated thing of doing this kind of experiment to make a transgenic 
mouse, it takes about a year to go from our DNA manipulation a ll the way to the live 
mouse w ith a disrupted gene. And sometimes what they find after spending ha lf of 
your PhD.  is that that was an essentia l gene. And, there's no live mouse, or it made 
it two days into being an embryo and it tanked at that point. But, this again, you 
could see, we talked about going back and forth between gene, protein, and trying to 
figure out function. 

All I can sort of do is give you the flavor of what's going on. But one sort of 
overarching thing  I hope you remember going through this is DNA sequencing, PCR, 
all these kinds of manipulations we're ta lking about are just exploiting these basic 
cellular components that we  learned about studying, how does DNA replicate? How is 
information coded? How do genes get expressed? How does genetic information gets 
sorted between cells? It's simp ly applying those relatively well understood  tools, or 
sort of b iological principles and parts that we  learned about, and now using them as 
tools in an eng ineering way, and have just comp letely transformed the way biology 
has been done in the  last couple decades. 

And it's just, as I say, things are changing so, so fast. It's almost breathtaking. So, 
the last little bit of sort of technique oriented stuff, I just want to at least make sure 
I've mentioned what are called microarrays. You often hear these referred to as DNA 
chips. The princip le here is this is a way that lets you ask, not only whether one gene 
is being expressed or not under a particular condition, whether its RNA is being 
made, and  in most cases that means making protein, or whether it's off, or whether 
it's at some intermediate level. 

A microarray lets you do that experiment with many, many, many genes at once. 
And here's the principle. You take some surface, and there will be a bunch of, if you 
will, sites on the surface, on this chip or whatever. And, what will go to be attached 
here would be a little piece of DNA from gene one. I mean, let's say, maybe a 
hundred nucleotides: that would be far more than enough to make it absolutely 
specific that they could only hybridize to a messenger RNA from gene one, and not 
from anything else. 

And, this one, then, would have from gene two,  this one, from gene three, and so 
on. Then, if we were to take a messenger RNA preparation from, say, an organism if 
it's a little one, or maybe a tissue, or something like that, anywhere you could isolate 
RNA from. And then, we'll  label it in some kind of way, and we can  label it 
radioactivity, we can label it w ith dyes. It's usua lly done w ith dyes, and  there are a 
variety of variations on this. Those are sort of technical details how to do it. But 
here's the princip le. Let's just, for the moment, just consider that it's got a label on 
it. 

So if we take the messenger RNA, and take this  little chip that has samples  in the 
extreme, it could be a sample of every sing le gene that's in the genome of that 
organism, we take this labeled RNA, actually what we would usually do is to use this 
to make a labeled cDNA preparation, which would be a copy of each one of these 
things. That the technica lly easy way to get label into it. 

But what we do have is if the gene was on, its messenger RNA would be on, and 
we'd have a bunch of stuff corresponding to gene one that had label on it. And if we 
give it a chance, that w ill, then, hybrid ize here. And there would be some way of 
detecting this  label. If gene two was off  in that sample, there won't be any 
hybrid ization. There won't be any signa l. You can sort of see in principle what you're 
doing is you're interrogating each gene in the extreme, each gene in the organism 
under some cond ition. Is it on? Is it off? If you d id various samp les, and you could 
see maybe it's in an intermediate level, and so on. So, the chips look  like that, 50-
100,000 genes perhaps, something like that. 

These things are really sma ll. Here's sort of a d isplay of a simp le one, and this is one 
where they're taking RNA. The samples are from two conditions. One's labeled with a 
dye that's green, and one's labeled with a dye that's red. And, if you get equal 
amounts, it looks yellow. So, they mix the two things together, and  if the gene is the 
same under two cond itions it would be yellow. Under one condition, if the gene was 
on in condition one than it would be green, and off in two, and back and forth. 

So, without trying to get lost in the technical details right now, which doesn't matter, 
the principle of this thing  is that you can take, you can sort of, by making a 
preparation of RNA, then you can use these DNA chips and say,  is each gene on and 
off? Or if I switch conditions, who comes on and off? So, it's a little like, I think of it 
this way. 

It's like having, a ll right, who's on today? And a number of hands go up, or 
something. And the rest of you would be off. But, come back on Monday, and I say 
to the something or other, and a different set of you would put up hands. And what 
I'm kind of looking at are the changes between that. And the sort of thing where this 
has been so powerful,  for example, is there are kind of cancers for which there is a 
treatment, but it was only 20% successful. And, when people started to study these 
cancers and then looked to see what genes were on, what they realized was even 
though physicians had g iven these cancers a particular name, if you looked at which 
genes were being expressed, they fell into two classes, class A and class B. 

And what they then rea lized was that the treatment they were using was 100% 
effective of tumors of class A, and wasn't doing anything for the tumors of class B. 
The physician couldn't tell the d ifference between these two types of tumors, but a 
microarray can say it. And once you have that kind of insight, if somebody has a 
tumor of the type A, you can use the treatment. It's very effective. And of course, 
when peop le are trying to do now would be to develop an equivalently effective 
treatment for something  for the tumor of type B. So, aga in we have so little time in 
this class. 

I could go on basically for ages. There's the output of the real sort of DNA chip. You 
can see things are very dense, and the great cleverness in doing these things, peop le 
now use the technology that goes w ith LaserJet printers to actually synthesize little 
pieces of either DNA or proteins starting on a  little spot on each membrane, or on 
the chip, or whatever. You put it on one nucleotide and then you put it on the next, 
and the next, and the next. 

You could sequence it using technology that's a lready around for inkjet printers at 
that kind of thing. So here you've seen a fusion of different types of engineering. OK, 
the last thing I'm going to tell you about is a little b it about the immune system. 
We've run into this. This  is a movie that some of you liked, got the b iggest aw I think 
of the last part of the course anyway. But what we are seeing here is a white b lood 
cell pushing aside from red b lood cells, which are stationary, and chasing a 
bacterium. It's obvious that it can trace  it. It's able to recognize some things, and at 
some point, then, it took it up. The principle of what happened there was this white 
blood cell had a capacity to recognize the bacteria, then bind to it. And then, its 
membrane, this is the membrane, and this is a white blood cell. 

There's many types of these, and it p inches the membrane off. So you have the 
bacterium. This is the bacterium. And, it's inside a little membrane compartment, as 
if the bacteria is in a little soap bubb le. And the principle of what happens is the 
white blood cell has another soap bubble that's full of poison. And, if you took two 
soap bubbles and push them together, you know what happens. They'll fuse, and 
you'll get a bigger soap bubble. And that's, in essence, how these white b lood cells 
normally kill bacteria. They would bring together these two compartments. Now you 
have a bacteria and a poison w ithin a white b lood cell at the bacterium, would get 
killed. 

And we ta lked about how bacteria fought back. That was a streptococcus that has a 
capsule. And the capsule, by having polysaccharide on the outside, prevent the white 
blood cell from being able to grab hold of some feature of the bacteria, that starts 
this process of killing  it. And when I told you the story of how DNA was found, it was 
people studying pneumonia. If you remember, it was streptococcus. If the 

streptococcus had a capsule, and the peop le would get very sick. And after five or six 
days,  there would be a crisis where they either lived, or they d ied. And what would 
happen  in that time is that, the last thing I'll tell you about, what's called the 
adaptive immune system would have generated special recognition molecules called 
antibod ies that would have learns to recognize the capsule at that bacterium. And 
once those were there, now those white blood cells would be ab le to capture the 
bacterium, because the antibodies give it a hand in recogniz ing there was something 
there that needed to be killed. 

The way this adaptive immune system works, it's a lmost like science fiction. And  I'll 
tell you the molecular basis of it. The key insight came from Susumu Tonegawa, 
another member of the MIT faculty b iology, and also runs Picower Center, who got a 
Nobel Prize for understand ing the basis of the diversity of the immune system. What 
I just want to do for the moment is just sort of point out the key features of what's 
called the adaptive immune system. 

And this is one of the reasons that we are able to live. And even though we get sick 
from time to time, and we've a ll had one thing or another get us for a little while 
during the semester,  the reason we aren't sick a ll the time, and the reason we 
recover when we get sick, as we have what's called an adaptive immune system. 
What happens when people get infected w ith HIV virus is the cells that it lives in and 
destroys are key players in your adaptive  immune system. 

And to some people don't die from the H1V infection  itself, they d ied because  lots of 
things that we just, bacteria or fungi, whatever things we just have on us and we 
live w ith all the time suddenly become killers because you lack the immune system 
that fights them off. So the so-ca lled adaptive immune system is absolutely amazing. 

So severa l features, it's got an incred ible diversity, there is a general word that's 
used to describe some sort of all sorts of chemical entities, and it's ca lled an antigen. 
So anyway, this can recognize many, many what are called antigens. And at the 
moment I think you can just think of them as some kind of chemica l entity. It could 
be a carbohydrate. It could be a little p iece of an organic molecule. It could be a few 
amino acids on a protein. But it's something that's potentially capable of being 
recognized by your immune system. So, there are many, many, many things. 

And the amaz ing thing is I can go into a  lab and synthesize a molecule that's never 
been seen on this Earth before and cha llenge somebody with it, and you'll produce 
an immune response that will be mounted aga inst that even though it's never been 
on Earth before. It's a lso the specificity. It  is completely amaz ing. If I were to take a 
protein, and then, let's say, put on a phenyl ring with a methyl there,  inject it into 
someone, the immune system would figure out how to recognize this thing w ith the 
phenyl ring, and the methyl. But, the response it generated, it would see this but 
not, let's say, that  if I wanted to get an immune system, something with methyl 
here, I'd have to put that into  the organism and let the immune system figure out a 
response. 

So, the specificity is at the same kind of level that you are used to here. If restriction 
enzymes can read d ifferent sequences in DNA or protein can tell one optical isomer 
of a sma ll molecule from another, it's this fitting of complementary shapes. So, w ith 
the immune system is a ll about is figuring out how to get a comp lementary shape 
somehow that's ab le to recognize essentially any kind of chemica l shape and 
structure you can think of. 

It's just mind blowing. And, you could a lready see right from the beginning, where 
the fundamental problem peop le could see from the beginning. It sounds like we 
would need a genome that's infinitely big,  full of things that are ready to recognize 
anything. And so, one of the rea l surprises  is, and now we know,  is there is 20,000 
genes are so in the human genome. There can't possibly be a zillion genes, each one 
specific for one of these structures. There had to be some underlying princip le that 
we had to learn. And that was one of the big challenges in the immune system  for a 
long time. 

Another one was that if you have an organism that has this capacity, and you could 
recognize it, why don't you do yourself  in? Because you yourself are full of entities 
that could, in principle, generate an immune system. So, one of the other things the 
immune system had to dea l w ith was avoid ing self recognition. If you're able to 
recognize anything, how do I not avoid killing my own selves? So, that is another 
really fundamenta l prob lem in this immune system. This is exciting. We can all stop 
and watch, but I think I'll just try and keep sold iering along for the last minute or so. 

So, one other feature that was interesting about the immune system, is it has a 
memory. And I'll tell you more about antibodies at the beginning of next  lecture. But, 
these are the kinds of molecule that's ab le to recognize these different entities. And 
you've all heard the term  in your ord inary life. But, if we look at the level of 
antibod ies that are made  in the body, if the first exposure to an antigen that would 
get some kind of response that comes up upon the first exposure, and this is time 
here. 

If we let there be some delay, it could be even into years, and then we get a second 
exposure, the antigen, the response is much higher. And this could be a log scale. 
So, it could be dramatically higher. So, what was the basis of that? How does it 
work? You see right there the princip le of vaccination in the sense that if you ever 
got chickenpox as a kid, your body has learned how to make antibodies. So if you 
ever see it aga in, it mounts a really big immune response. 

If you want to have a disease something like tetanus that you haven't seen, you go 
to the doctor and they squirt and a b it of the stuff that doesn't make you sick, but it 
gives you the initia l immune response. Then, if you ever step on a rusty na il, you get 
a very powerful response aga inst tetanus. And that sort of the underlying principle of 
vaccination is this concept of memory. We'll pick that up on Wednesday. So, have a 
great Patriots Day weekend.
