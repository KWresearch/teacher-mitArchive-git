Transcript â€“ Lecture 33 

So, today we're going to continue w ith our series of lectures to come to a conclusion 
from the section on population and community ecology. At last time, or three 
lectures ago, we were talking about the regulation of population growth. And this 
time, we're going to move into, just wanted to make sure the boards are in order, 
community ecology. And as I said of the first lecture, this is one of the most difficult 
branches of the ecological sciences to really describe because an ecological 
community is a b it of an abstract concept. And one definition is that it's a collection 
of species that are linked together by their feed ing relationships. 

OK, so  it's sort of like the ecosystem w ithout the biogeochemistry in a sense. So 
really what we're looking at here is the interaction between species in a  localized 
area w ith respect to how they influence each other's fitness, in a sense. And these 
interrelationships between these species govern all of the things that we talked 
about in the first ha lf of my lectures set. It's these interactions that shape the 
biogeochemistry of those systems. So, this is the structure of the system and the 
biogeochemistry is the function of the system. And it's a lso these interactions. So, 
they affect the flow of energy, which we ta lked about. 

They affect the cycling of elements. They affect the evolution,  the very evolution of 
species within the community. And these communities self assemb le. In other words, 
if you start with an empty plot of bare land, we talked about this. Remember the 
example of the glacier retreating and show ing the succession of species as the 
glacier retreated? We started w ith a bare rock, and you'll start getting lichen growing 
on the rock. And then that lichen will create a little b it of soil, allow ing plants to 
come in, and that the plants increase productivity. 

Some of them bring nitrogen and, a llowing shrubs and trees and everything. And 
that's the self-assemb ly of the community. Once you have plant there, you can have 
insects there. Once you have insects there, you have birds there. It self assembles. 
And one of the questions that ecolog ists ask is, how deterministic is that? I mean, we 
know there are some random components to  it, and we know that there are some 
things that will happen because we see it happen over, and over, and over. 

So the big question is what must happen? What could happen? And what might not 
ever happen? That's rea lly one of the cha llenges of ecologists is to understand those 
assembly rules of community if there are any. Now, we're not going to really get into 
that. We are just going to start looking at the real fundamentals of community 
[SOUND OFF/THEN ON] which is, what are the possib le interactions between species 
that shape evolution? OK. Species interactions: so, when we talk about species 
interactions and how they structure communities, we have to  first define some 
terms. 

One is Darw inian fitness. And the fitness of an individua l is the relative ab ility of an 
individual in a population to survive and reproduce. So, it's a ll relative, OK, within a 
population. And we're going to define also, we'll be talking about adaptations, and I 
know you know what this  is, but let's just make sure that we are all operating w ith 

the same assumption. And an adaptation, which is something that affects the fitness, 
is a heritab le tra it that increases the fitness of an individual with respect to other 
individuals in that population. 

So, these are just some operating assumptions so that when we talk about species 
interactions, there are severa l possibilities. If we have organism one and organism 
two, we can have, and we ask how does the presence of organism two and the 
presence of organism one affect the fitness of the two organisms? And if the fitness 
of both organisms is increased by being in the presence of the other, that's ca lled 
mutualism. Being together increases the fitness of both relative to when they're 
alone. 

If being together decreases the fitness of both, that's called competition. And if you 
have the situation, what we reca ll that? It could be parasitism, yeah, parasitism. 
What else? Was the ultimate form of reduced fitness? Predation, yeah, being dead is 
the ultimate reduced fitness. So, parasitism and predation. And then there are some 
other sort of rather vague interactions where when you put two ind ividua ls together, 
the fitness of one is not influenced but the fitness of the other is either influenced 
positively or negatively, and we're not going to talk about those. 

But this one's ca lled commenca lism. And this one's ca lled amensalism. And obviously 
there are gradients. Actua lly, an example of commencalism is something that we've 
talked about. Can anybody think about what that is when we ta lked about food 
webs? It's kind of a stretch, but detritivory. An organism eating detritus, in a sense, 
is commencalism because it doesn't affect the fitness of the dead individua l because 
it's a lready dead. 

So, that gets to not having that much meaning. So anyway, these we are not going 
to spend time on, but they are forms of interaction that do exist. And there are 
gradients between these. Obviously, it's not a ll black and white. So, we're going to 
start by talking about competition. And just to remind you, competition comes in two 
forms. There is intraspecific competition, which means w ithin a species, OK? And 
that's not what we're going to be ta lking about today, but we've a lready ta lked about 
this without explicitly, remember our logistic equation and the density dependent 
feedback mechanisms in that population that caused the population to deviate from 
exponentia l growth was due to intraspecific competition: ind ividua ls w ithin a species 
competing w ith each other for resources. 

We are going to ta lking about now is more interspecific -- -- which is competition 
between species, OK? So, I want to show you some slides that are just from your 
textbook, but just to get you in the mood for competition. So, it comes in all 
different forms, and I don't care whether you know the names of these. It doesn't 
matter. This is just to g ive you an idea of the d ifferent types of competition that we 
see in nature. This is what's called consumptive competition, and this is just showing 
the roots of the trees competing for nutrients  in the soil. Preemptive competition 
shows these are barnacles. We're going to ta lk a little b it more about that later, just 
tota lly taking over the substrate. 

So no other organism could possib ly settle there. Overgrowth competition in plants 
where this plant would be shad ing, so other plants that require a lot of light could 
not grow underneath. Chemica l competition also occurs where one p lant w ill actually 
excrete certa in chemica ls that create these corridors of no growth around them so 

other p lants can't get near to compete for the nutrients. The classic form of 
competition, say, in birds and a lot of higher organisms is competition for territory. 

So these are d isplays so that an ind ividua l can keep a certain territory, and therefore 
make that food available to  itself, therefore increasing its fitness because it's ab le to 
feed its young. And then this  is sort of the classic, rea lly tooth and claw competition 
where encounter competition where all these species are competing over this zebra 
carcass, hyena, vultures, etc. OK, now before we can talk more and more in deta il 
about competition, we need to define the ecolog ica l niche. And this is an interesting 
concept in ecology that has been around for quite some time, and it kind of went out 
of popularity for a while. 

And I was gratified to see that it's made it back into  the introductory b iology 
textbooks because I think it's a very profound concept. In this particular competition, 
the fundamental ecolog ica l niche comes from G. Evelyn Hutchinson, who is one of 
the founders of modern ecology. He defined as the fundamenta l niche of an organism 
as an N-dimensiona l hypervolume, every point on which a species can survive and 
reproduce  indefinitely in the absence of other species, OK? So, this is an abstract 
concept, because those species are rarely in the absence of other species, except 
maybe in a test tube. 

But it defines the, and a lso we can't even think about N-dimensions, right? We're 
able to think about, we can envision three dimensions. But what he's ta lking about 
here, is every sing le dimension in the environment that would have any effect on the 
fitness of an organism. So here, just to wrap our bra ins around this, we're looking at 
three dimensions. 

Our organisms here is a ladybug, and this would be food size. These guys eat little 
aphids and things. I don't know if you've ever used them under house plants, but it's 
a good way to keep aphids off your house plants if you want to introduce ladybugs to 
your dorm room, which maybe you don't. But there's a certa in range of size, food 
size, that they can eat. And so, that's three dimensions. 

There are undoubtedly many other dimensions that we don't even know about, 
elements that they require, etc. So, this would be everywhere, in this space is a 
space where this organism could survive and  reproduce indefinitely. And the reason 
this concept lost favor is its something you could never ever measure this because 
we can't know the N-d imensions. Well, you can never say you can't know anything, 
but it's very d ifficult to say you could know all the d imensions that influence the 
fitness of an organism. But it's still a very important concept for thinking about it. 
And the niche is not a physical place, OK? The niche of an organism is not a physical 
place. In an N-d imensiona l hypervolume. 

It's an abstract concept. So this is the fundamental niche, and here's another closely 
related species whose niche has some overlap w ith this one, but has different ranges 
for temperature, humidity, and food size. And when you have overlapping niches is 
when you have the possibility, the potentia l, for competition. And two things can 
happen. If they overlap a lot, than those two species cannot coexist in the same 
environment. One w ill outcompete the other, and it w ill move on to some other place 
where it doesn't have a strong competitor. But  if they overlap a little, you can 
actually have competitive coexistence. And we're going  to talk about the results of 
these degrees of niche overlap as we go on in the lecture. So, if the species can 
makes it rea lized, so this is its fundamenta l niche, this one's fundamental niche, and 

what happens if  it can make its realized niche small enough so that there's no niche 
overlap, then you can have coexistence of those two species, or very little niche 
overlap in the same environment. 

So that's the d ifference between the fundamental and  the realized niche. I think this 
is from your textbook. This is just one dimension, seed sized, for, say, a bird eating 
seeds of this size range. We'll be talking about b irds a lot in this. And here's partial 
niche overlap, species to where they eat some seeds of the same size, but by and 
large the mode  is different. You can have species coexisting. 

Partial niche overlap can lead to competitive coexistence. And here's the comp lete 
overlap in just this one d imension, which would lead to competitive exclusion. But 
obviously it matters what's happening on all the dimensions. This is just an 
oversimp lification,  to g ive you the idea. OK, so before we go to that, I want to ta lk 
about the classic experiment that led to this, they're going to put this screen up. 
Screen, screen, screen, screen. Can you see, or do I need to turn the lights on? 
Thank you. 

I'm sorry, I a lways ask my questions that way, where there's no possible answer. 
There were some classic competition experiments that's carried out by Gause way 
back in 1934 -- -- that I'm just going to use to illustrate the concept of competitive 
exclusion, because these were done with very simple protozoa in a test tube, 
paramecia, and actually this was back in the days when they were develop ing these 
theories for population growth. And these organisms were growing according  to the 
logistic equation. So here we are w ith, and this is the classic experiment actually in 
your textbook that they talk about in the context of the ecolog ical niche. 

So this is Paramecia caudatum. These names aren't important. Don't worry about it, 
but we have to call them something. P. aurelia, which, when grown a lone in a test 
tube grow accord ing to the logistic equation, they grow up and then they level off at 
a certa in level. And what Gause did is that he wanted to see, look at this 
phenomenon of competition and he grew them together, and he found that, actually 
that no matter what combination he put in, aurelia would a lways win out  in 
competitive exclusion. 

And he learned  through a series of experiments, we don't have time to go into the 
deta ils, but this would a lways occur if you made two species compete in a very 
simple environment. In the test tube where he was feeding  these guys exactly the 
same food, some form of bacteria, in a test tube this one would a lways outcompete 
the other, and there would be competitive exclusion. 

If he made the environment more complex, where there were layers in it, or there 
was sediment  in the bottom of the test tube, that a llowed more niche d imensions. 
There were conditions under which the competitive coexistence would be a llowed. 
And he actually developed a set of equations to describe his competition that I'm 
going to write for you. We're not going to use them; we're not going to ana lyze them 
in detail, but I'm just going to show  them to you so that you have an appreciation for 
how population ecologists and community ecologists start to think about these 
systems. So, he sa id we can model this interaction using our logistic equation. 

So he said dN/dt would be the growth rate of, let's call, the top one, one. It doesn't 
matter what you call which. The dN/dt equals r1, N1. Now here's our logistic, K1 
minus N1 over K. But he said I'm going to mod ify this equation so that the actua l 

growth of the organism is reduced to some amount that's proportiona l to the number 
of the other organisms that are there. So, he called that alpha-N2. OK, so some 
amount that's proportional to amount the other species that's here. 

And then, he said dN2/DT is equal to r2, N2, K2 minus N2 minus beta-N1 over,  this 
should be K1, over K2. So, the growth rate of species to in the presence of species 
one  is reduced by some amount that's proportional to the abundance of species one. 
And these, the va lues of these, these are ca lled competition coefficients. You can 
actually do experiments and put values on these, and they are a measure of how 
strong a competitor each of these species are w ith respect to the other one. So, 
you're not going to have to dea l w ith these, but I just wanted you to see them, and 
see how population ecologists began to model these systems. 

And so, it's the relative values of these relative to the carrying capacities that w ill 
ultimately determine whether species will coexist or not when they are competing. 
OK, so  that's more of a  theoretica l analysis. Now let's look at the rea l world. 
Competitive exclusion, that is, the exclusion of one species from an environment 
because of strong competition in another, is very d ifficult to study, because if it's not 
there, you don't know it was excluded, right? I mean, you don't go to some place 
and say I don't see the species here. It must have been eliminated by competitive 
exclusion. 

It might never have been there. So, the way we learn about this phenomenon is 
either through inadvertent experiments, and that is the  introduction of species to 
new environments and then see what happens, or actua l intentiona l ecological 
experiments. So, we're going to ta lk about both of those. And the first one -- -- we'll 
talk about invasions -- -- and competitive exclusion. 

And one of the classic examples of this is the zebra mussel. I don't know what 
happened. Oh, there it is. I d idn't realize this was animated. That's why there was 
nothing there. So, the zebra mussel is a tiny mussel that was introduced to the 
United States back in, I guess, 1988. And up here, introduced into the Great Lakes 
by ships just being attached to ships, or it's possib le it might have been the larvae in 
ships' ballasts. Ships go into port, they take on water into their ba llasts to stab ilize, 
and then they go to another port and let it out. And they're filled with larvae and 
species. So, the entire world oceans are now filled with introduced species from ships 
ballasts. 

So here's 1988. The zebra mussel is there. 1990: here. 92: here. 94, 90 whatever, 
oh, 2001. It spread amaz ingly fast. And it  is this tiny little mussel that seems to 
thrive everywhere: clogs, a ll kinds of pipes, settles on top of other native shellfish 
and kills them, and has led to extensive competitive exclusion of native shellfish in a 
number of ecosystems. Some of the effects of these: in some ecosystems they 
cleared up the water. They are able to  filter just an amaz ing amount of water when 
they're feeding. 

So they actually have increased the clarity of the water in many ecosystems,  filtering 
out plankton, which allows the light to penetrate deeper in those systems, a llowing 
aquatic plants to grow from the bottom. So the introduction of this one species can 
completely change the structure of the entire ecosystem. I just heard a lecture. 

I was just visiting the Institute for Ecosystem Studies which is out in Millbrook, NY. 
By the way, if any of you are looking  for summer internships and are interested in 

ecology, they have a  fabulous summer internship program. I've had severa l students 
go there that have had great experiences. But there's somebody there studying the 
zebra mussel invasion in the Hudson River. And he showed this incred ibly depressing 
graph of over the last ten years of the native mussels in that river going down to 
basically extinction. 

And then, this is the weird thing about ecosystems, just last year it started to turn 
around. And they haven't done anything to erad icate the zebra mussels, but the 
native mussels are starting to have a comeback. And nobody knows why, and 
nobody knows whether it's a real comeback because it could come back for a couple 
of years. So, it's really  interesting how unpredictable these comp lex systems are. 

But these mussels can cause millions and millions of dollars of damage. And I also 
learned on that trip that ecologists are trying to get in p lace policies that  if an 
industry for whatever reasons wants to intentionally introduce, Here's an examp le of 
an application of fundamental ecolog ica l knowledge. The reason people study the 
ecology of invasive species, understanding this competitive exclusion and all that, is 
that you want to use that understanding to be able to predict, if you introduce a new 
species to a new habitat, whether it will be invasive or not, there are some species 
you can introduce and they w ill fit right  in and not exclude every other species. And 
so, what they're trying to put in p lace is insurance that a company would have to 
buy that was either intentiona lly introducing a species, or whatever practice that 
they were doing was likely to introduce a species, and the cost of that insurance 
would be a  function of the probability of that species actually causing competitive 
exclusion. 

And this is something that peop le are trying to put into place  in to the economic 
system basica lly. So, it puts a new meaning to limited liability company, LLC. So, 
you have to insure your liability, which I think would go a long way to reduce some 
of these ecological crises. OK, so  that's an inadvertent experiment. 

Now there are many, many examples of this. There's books written on invasive 
species. And if I can get this thing to work, I'll show you some clips of invasive 
species, snakes. And the biggest impact is on islands because islands have been 
isolated ecosystems for so long that if you introduce a species, you have dramatic 
changes. In Australia, a b ig examp le was a prickly pear cactus which was introduced 
many years ago to create living fences for livestock. They completely took over not 
all of the grasslands, but a lot of the grasslands and turn them into thickets. 

OK, so  invasive species are inadvertent ecological experiments. Let's talk about 
intentional experiments. And this  is also very classic textbook experiment that was 
one of the first ecologica l experiments to be done. And it was done w ith barnacles. 
This was Joseph Connell was a professor at the University of Ca lifornia, Santa 
Barbara. Barnacles have a larval stage that floats around in the p lankton, and then 
they settle on rocks. So this was a classic barnacle ecosystem in Scotland, actua lly, 
in which the upper inner tidal there is a species called Chthamalus. And then the 
lower was dominated by a species of mussel ca lled Balanus. 

So, he asked the question, is this distribution where the two are exclusive of one 
another, is it due to competition between them, or is it just that this one tolerates 
desiccation longer than this one? The inner tidal zone, the tide goes up and down, so 
this one's going to be exposed to dryness a lot longer. So, how do you answer that 
question? Well, you do an experiment and so what he d id was he took rocks from the 

upper, inner tidal that had the Chthamalus on them, and he moved them to the 
lower one. And he let the Balanus, the species that dominates down here colonize on 
those rocks. But then he divided them in half, and removed the Ba lanus from half of 
the rock. And then he monitored the survivorship of the Chthama lus. 

And remember the survivorship curves that we talked about when we created those 
life tab les, he actua lly measured survivorship curves on these. If you go to the 
orig ina l paper, you see LX is a function of time. So that's a tool that we use, to ask 
the question, is the survivorship of Chthamalus increased in the absence of Balanus? 
And this is all from your textbook, showing that the percent of morta lity, when a 
competitor is present is much higher than the competitor is absent. 

So, he's ab le to show directly that there was competition between the two. And in 
fact, this was that kind of aggressive kind of competition where one just p lucks the 
other one off the rock. I mean it's direct: you're on my rock; get out of here, and it 
pops it off. He a lso was able to show that tolerance to desiccation is a lso a  factor in 
this system. 

It's not like it's totally competition. But competition was p laying a role, and so I've 
summarized that in this slide using our terminology. He was able to show that the 
fundamenta l niche of Chthama lus, in other words -- -- the reg ion in the inner tidal, 
where the larvae could actually settle and live in the absence of competitors was 
much broader than the realized niche. All right, so let's get this over. This is from 
your textbook. 

And we're going to just use, I'm going to use an example of that. So, competition 
can also lead to character d isp lacement -- -- which in turn can lead to actua l 
competitive coexistence. And an example of this, we're going to  talk about Darwin's 
finches in the Galapagos Islands. And one of the ways that ecolog ists actually 
measure, that's a b ird, in case you d idn't notice  it. And  this is beak depth. The shape 
and size of a beak tells you what kinds of seeds a bird can eat, and so they 
measured beak depth as a niche d imension, basica lly, because it tells you what size 
seeds the bird can eat. 

And a study was done; we're going to make the  islands here. What is going to call 
them A, B, C, D; these are islands. And there are two species of finches, which we 
are just going to ca ll F. Well, they're fuliginosa. Again, the name's not important, and 
the other one is ca lled fortis. So, we'll just call them, on islands that have both of 
them, and there are some islands that have only one. 

So, what was done is they measure the beak depth of the d ifferent finches on the 
islands where they were found together versus islands where they were found alone 
in the Galapagos Islands. And what they found, and this has been shown for many, 
many d ifferent stud ies. You look at the beak depth d istribution. This is percent in 
size class. 

And this is island C, D, and A, and B. And they found that when the species were on 
islands where they lived alone, they had a lmost complete niche, oh this is beak 
depth. They had exactly the same size beak d istributions. In other words, they were 
feed ing on the same food. And on the islands where they were together, A and B, 
I'm just making sure this actua lly holds together, they found what is called character 
displacement, and that is that the birds that had longer beaks and smaller beaks, 

were preferentially selected for such that reducing the amount of niche overlap. So, 
and this leads to competitive coexistence. 

OK, and that's what we're  looking at here. This is from your textbooks. This is from 
African seed crackers show ing that birds w ith smaller bills consume soft seeds more 
efficiently. Birds w ith larger bills crack hard seeds, and you can see that the w idth of 
the b ill here is d ifferent.
