7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 5 

I've emphasized in the first lecture, you know, that there's a lot of stuff that happens 
just in your ordinary life. I saw two examples of this. Yesterday's Boston Globe, just 
on the front page there was a discovery about "Heart Cell Discovery Ra ises 
Treatment Hopes". Scientists announced yesterday the discovery of cells in the heart 
that can create new muscle cells ra ising hopes that doctors may find dramatic new 
ways to treat heart disease. 

The team showed that the cells, which are similar to stem cells, can be expanded 
from just a  few hundred in the  laboratory d ish up to more than a million. And these 
can be guiding into becoming the pulsing muscles that power the heart. So when we 
were talking about those yeast d ividing and saying how one cell becomes two, this  is 
a genera l princip le throughout life that cells come from other cells and they d ivide. 

And we'll see the relationship to that w ith DNA replication as we go a long. In the 
case of yeast, as I sa id, they're just always the same. Your progeny are a lways the 
same. But in something like our own cells we start out as a single fertilized cell but 
somewhere along the way the cells have to become specialized. So the very early 
ones are the embryonic stem cells. They have the potential to become any cell in the 
body. 

But at some point, at one of these cell divisions the cells are going to have to start to 
become more specia lized. And, for example, this one might be a lineage that would 
lead to heart muscle or to becoming a nerve or something. And at that point  it loses 
its ab ility to become any cell in the body. And in many cases by the time you get out 
ultimately to the fina l cell that's making up the muscle or the nerve or something it 
has no capacity to regenerate. 

So that's why,  for examp le, sp inal cord injuries are so damag ing because nerves at 
this point cannot be regenerated. Or heart d isease, you get a damaged heart we're 
stuck. This is why this result is exciting. Because there seem to be at least a few 
cells in the heart that have the capacity to regenerate more heart muscle. Now, this 
is early on. It hasn't been rigorously shown to be a stem cell. But there's an examp le 
from the front of yesterday's paper about something we were virtua lly a lluding to in 
class. 

There was also an article about AIDS testing. Again, you know, we'll talk more about 
the HIV-1 virus. And then today on the front page of the Boston Globe yet aga in is 
"Romney Draws Fire on Stem Cells". And you can look at this. But, you know, he's 
sort of trying to straddle, I guess, between being supportive of research on the one 
hand and the concerns of the conservatives and  the religious right on the other 
hand, and he's drawing fire from both sides. 

But it's an issue that is in our society today. You're going to be expected to make 
decisions on it, to know about it and understand. I'm just trying to drive home that 
what we're ta lking about isn't taking place in a vacuum. Nobody ema iled me an idea 
as to what happened here. I showed you this little movie. This is water that is cooled 

below the freezing point but hasn't formed ice crystals, but  if we put a little bit of this 
pseudomonas syringae in it then somehow that super-cooled water turned into ice. 

And I told you it was a protein on the surface. Nobody had any ideas. So why don't 
you turn to whoever is close to you and you can ta lk about it for 30 seconds and see 
if anybody can come up with an idea as to why. All right? I won't look. You know, 
just go ahead. Talk to somebody and come up w ith an idea. OK. Well, let's see. D id 
we manage to get any ideas? Anybody got the courage to try and guess what that 
protein might be doing? Pardon? It's a nonpolar molecule. 

It's not d isturbing the bonds. It's an interesting idea. Do you have an  idea then, are 
you able to extend that as to why then the ice would start to  form? I mean it's 
certainly true that nonpolar bonds sort of interfere w ith the water. That's something 
we've talked about. Let's see. Any other ideas? Yeah? That's a version of the same 
idea, I think, hydrophobic because you think it wants to repel the water and push  it 
together. 

That's interesting. You're sort of getting closer on these. Yeah? There it is. If you 
were to design a protein that basica lly could bind water molecules  in a lattice that 
mimicked what you found in ice then the water molecules coming up and bind ing to 
these little pockets in the protein would present then a little field of stable water 
molecules that looked to the next water molecule like it was part of an ice crystal. 

And that's indeed how that bacterium does that trick. It's called the ice nucleation 
protein. And they do things like take this bacterium and they put it into things like 
when you're doing snowmaking, you put this in and then you spray the super-cooled 
water, and this makes it go into ice crysta ls and then it helps you get nice snow for 
ski resorts and things. 

That's at  least one of the areas where it's used. OK. So I'm just going to show you 
this movie again. These are just baker's yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, a kind of 
sing le-celled yeast that's used in baking bread or making beer. And here we're 
seeing cells d ivide. And this particular kind of yeast has a way of doing, it kind of 
buds the daughter off from the side. Some doub le and then sp lit down the middle. 

But you can see what's going on. There's a lot of cell growth going on. And the issue 
that we're going to address now is where does the energy come that's needed to do 
that? You know from your own experience that to build things, to make things takes 
energy. You cannot put up a bridge, you cannot put up a build ing, you cannot build a 
computer chip without somehow putting energy  in. 

You're taking a bunch of matter in the universe and ordering it in a very specific way 
making new contacts that didn't be there. It's an energy-requiring process. And  I'm 
going to ta lk today about where that energy comes from. And then I want to tell you 
a little b it, just a very brief historical thing a long the way, because a point I've 
emphasized here is b iology is an experimenta l science. 

And many of the greatest discoveries weren't because somebody had the idea and 
then went out to prove  it. Very often we didn't even understand how it worked. And 
somebody was investigating a phenomenon, found some peculiar things, and then 
began to get insights. And the insights were what then led to a fundamental  increase 
in our understand ing. And this little b it of history involves some names that you see 
on the MIT buildings around here. 

One is Lavoisier who is a French scientist. And he was studying what happened when 
grapes were converted into wine, a good topic for a French scientist to be studying. 
So, in essence, what he was studying was glucose being converted to  two molecules, 
excuse me, of -- -- ethanol and two molecules of carbon dioxide. This 
transformation, there's C6H12O6. 

Remember, carbohydrates have that composition. And so he was studying that. He 
managed to figure out that's what happened to  the sugar when you were making the 
wine. And at that point he got beheaded. That terminated that part of his 
investigation. But this problem was then picked up by Louis Pasteur who, aga in, his 
name is on one of the MIT buildings. He worked  in France as well. 

There's a Pasteur Institute in Paris. There's a nice museum in Lille in Northern France 
that has a lot of this. But he grew up in Arbois which is a town in sort of Eastern 
France that, as you can see from the little picture of the village, winemaking was a 
major industry. So he was interested in that probably from when he was a small, 
sma ll kid, although probab ly not dressed like that. 

But anyway. So one of the issues that he took on, which was a  real problem  for the 
wine growers in his little town and in France  in general was sometimes w ines would 
go bad. They'd come out sour and couldn't be drunk and then you'd lose all the profit 
that would have come from that wine. So there was a  lot of interest in trying to 
figure out how to prevent wines from going bad. And so Louis Pasteur started to 
study this. 

And he d iscovered that there was this conversion that had been figured out now of 
two ethanol and two carbon dioxide. So this was a conversion. And we now  refer to it 
generally as "a  fermentation". But what he d iscovered with this conversion occurred 
-- -- if yeast were present. That the rate of this conversion varied as the number of 
yeast, so it went faster if there were more yeast. 

And the yeast stopped growing -- -- when the sugar ran out. So what he d iscovered 
here was a correlation. He hadn't proven anything. He just saw that if you watch 
sugar go to ethanol there were yeast around, if you had more yeast it went faster, 
and when you ran out of sugar the yeast stopped growing. There was something 
connected here. So he came up with the idea that the yeast were responsible for this 
conversion that was happening when you made wine. 

And it was further helped out in this because he discovered an alternative -- --
conversion in which C6H12O6 went instead to give two molecules of 
CH3CHOHCOOH. This molecule which you know, lactic acid, it too has C6H12O6 on 
both sides of the equation but it's a d ifferent molecule. And what he found was that 
this is the lactic acid you know as what's in yogurt. It makes yogurt sour. Or if you 
exercise really hard and your muscles are sore that's because you accumulate lactic 
acid in your muscles, and I'll tell you why that is in the next lecture. 

But what the other thing that Pasteur realized was when you got this a lternative 
conversion you didn't have yeast present, you had some other organism. And so that 
was a huge advance just of practical va lue to the winemakers because they knew 
they had to have yeast in there to get wine and  there problems were coming when 
some other organism that wasn't yeast got in there and it did something different 

with the sugar and made it  into lactic acid instead of making it into ethanol and 
carbon dioxide. 

So there was Pasteur working away on a practical prob lem and it was, you know, a 
really major advance to the w inemaking industry for him to do this, but it a lso then 
sort of unexpected ly led to another issue. And that was why were the yeast doing 
this? Because one of the things that Lavoisier had noticed and Pasteur noticed was 
that you did this conversion. 

The two ethanol p lus two carbon dioxide. But you could account for virtually a ll of the 
carbon and hydrogens and oxygens that started out as sugar and seemed like 
virtually of them showed up in the ethanol and the carbon dioxide. So why was the 
yeast doing this? And the idea began to develop out of that was that rather than 
being used to make biomass,  in which case you would have expected to see a whole 
lot of mass in the yeast cells and no so much up here, that  instead most of this sugar 
was being used to make energy and that somehow the cell was getting the energy 
necessary to do the synthetic work involved in cell d ivision by carrying out this 
conversion. 

And there's a fundamenta l relationship then between chemica l energy and whether a 
reaction can proceed. And I'll just take it through in sort of your typical introductory 
chemistry reaction, A plus B going to C plus D. You know, there are certa in classes of 
reactions that w ill go almost to completion. Probably an overstatement to say it's to 
go to completion, but it's effectively over here. 

Those are termed irreversible reactions, and there are certa inly some of them. If I 
have hydrogen and oxygen and I light a little match, you pretty much go a ll the way 
to making water with a great big boom and no hydrogen or not much hydrogen and 
oxygen left on the other side. However, most reactions that one finds in nature don't 
have that quality. Instead they are going forward at some rate and back at another. 
And they reach eventua lly an equilibrium that's characterized by what's known as an 
equilibrium constant which is the product of the concentrations of the products over 
the product of the concentration of the reactants. 

And that's a characteristic of every particular chemica l reaction. And we really have 
to worry about this in b iology because if everything was irreversible that would be 
fine, but in order to do a ll this synthetic work you have to deal with a lot of reactions 
that aren't going to go to completion. And nature has had to figure out a way of 
doing that, just the same way that bridges and build ings don't spontaneously 
assemble and engineers and others have had to work out ways of putting a ll of those 
things together. 

So at some level you see the same kind of problem. Now, there's a way of 
expressing this energy associated w ith a chemical reaction that can be used to 
directly calculate whether a reaction is going to go and how far it will go. And a 
person who did this work is another person who's on one of the MIT buildings. It was 
Willard G ibbs who was a faculty member chemist who worked at Ya le in the 1980s, 
excuse me, 1800s, and he came up with an expression that's now known as "G ibbs 
free energy". 

And what's important about this way of ta lking about the energy change associated 
with the chemical reaction is  it considers not only the internal energy of the system 
but a lso the change in disorder. Or another way of saying that, for those of you 

who've run into the laws of thermodynamics, it combines the first and second laws of 
thermodynamics. And you have to consider both of those if you're going to consider 
whether a  reaction will go. 

And you cannot measure an absolute free energy but you can measure a change. 
And this is the equation. It's the change associated with a chemical reaction is equa l 
to the change associated w ith the chemical reaction under some set of standard 
cond itions times RT times the log of the concentration of the products multiplied 
together over the concentration of the reactants. So if we could just go to the same 
example we were just thinking about, the energy change w ith that reaction that we 
were considering would have been this. 

So this is the energy change -- -- associated with the concentrations -- -- the 
reactants and products that we're considering. This  is the energy change under 
standard, or the term standard cond itions where everything, each reactant, each 
product  is present under one molar concentrations. So not something you'd ever find 
in most cases, but it's a frame of reference. And then this is the universal gas 
constant -- -- which is two times ten to the minus third kilocalories per mole per 
degree Kelvin, the temperature in absolute. 

This is the temperature in degrees Kelvin. And the temperature for most biology, 
most life is around 25 degrees Centigrade, so that's equa l to 298 degrees Kelvin, 
which is about equa l to 300 degrees Kelvin. So  for most -- And since the range in 
which life can occur on an absolute temperature sca le is rea lly pretty sma ll,  it sort of 
fluctuates in only very minor ways around 25 degrees Centigrade, then for most of 
the b iological reactions we'll be thinking about this RT number is about 0. 

6 kilocalories per mole. Now, b iochemists actually have a specia l form of free energy 
they use, which we put a delta G prime. And in this case the delta G prime is equal 
to delta G prime under a set of standard conditions plus RT natura l log of C products 
over the reactants. But the assumption  is made that the reaction is in water which, I 
mentioned the other day, is 55 molar. 

Yeah? This is the degree Celsius. I've just expressed it in degrees Kelvin. Sorry. My 
mistake. Excuse me. Because I was wrong is why. OK. Thanks for catching that. All 
right. So water is very concentrated. And so under these cond itions the other 
convention is then you can set the hydrogen ions and water molecules to one. And 
you don't have to think about them when we're doing this. This is a convention that 
biochemists do. 

Now, this free energy, the delta G that g ives free energy is a thermodynamic -- --
property. And I'll just share with you the same visual image I've had since I was an 
undergrad, which I think is not a bad way of thinking about  it trying to understand 
what happens, that if we have a plot of the free energy as a  function of what 
happens as the reaction goes a long so that we have A p lus B here and C plus D down 
here. 

When you go from reactants to products, the way I've drawn it, some kind of energy 
is given off in this kind of reaction. And if you know that you will know then that the 
reaction will be able to go  forward because it's able to g ive off energy just the same 
way hydrogen and oxygen give off a lot of heat and stuff, and you know that 
reaction rea lly goes a long way to comp letion. 

So it's kind of as if you were out here on your spring break on your skis a lready to go 
down the black diamond hill, you know, you can sort of see what would happen. 
Now, because it's a thermodynamic property it doesn't matter what route you take 
to get from the reactants to the products. So if you go down the double diamond 
slope or you go down the bunny slope you still end up with the same amount of 
energy coming out of the reaction. 

And that's important because if that wasn't true you could make a perpetual motion 
machine and you'd be very rich. The second thing that's important is that the free 
energy w ill tell you what would happen if the reaction went but it w ill not tell you 
whether it can go. If I did a demo here and I brought some hydrogen and some 
oxygen and I mixed them together in a vessel in the front of the class we could all sit 
here waiting for it to exp lode. 

But the likelihood is we would sit here for a very, very long time and not see an 
exp losion, right? And the reason is that in order to get that hydrogen and oxygen 
close enough together we had to give them some extra energy and push them so 
they overcome repulsion and stuff. So if you were out here on your skis again 
getting already to go, but  in fact you got off at the wrong stop on the ski lift and you 
were there, even though there would be energy getting down from here it's not 
going to happen at any discernable rate g iven the sort of little bounce in energy you 
have in your normal lives. 

So what we're doing when we do hydrogen and oxygen is by putting a match into it 
or something we're giving it enough energy that actua lly a  few of the molecules get 
up here, they drop down, then they give up so much energy and heat that all the 
rest of them get pushed up and the thing goes. But that's sort of not a bad way of 
thinking about it. 

And we're going to ta lk in a minute about what determines how fast reactions go, 
not whether they go or not. And then, of course, at that point we're going to have to 
worry about this issue. But before that what I want to show you is that there's a 
direct relationship between this G ibbs free energy and the equilibrium constant. So 
we have this, well, what we could do is you have the reaction over there. 

So let's consider that reaction has come to equilibrium. And that means there'll be no 
further energy change. So we'll just set the delta G to zero. And that would mean 
then that delta G prime zero is equa l to minus RT concentration C over D over 
concentration of A over B. You'll recognize this. That's the equilibrium constant, 
right? I'm sorry. There's a natural log in here. 

I d idn't get it in. OK? So which  is equal to minus RT the natura l log of the equilibrium 
constant or the natural log of the equilibrium constant is equal to minus delta G 
prime zero over RT. Or another way of saying that is the K equilibrium is equal E to 
the minus delta G prime zero over RT. So  if you think back to consequences of an 
equilibrium constant, if the reaction is going to go almost all the way then there are 
going to be mostly products, very few  reactions, so the K equilibrium w ill be large. 

So if a  reaction is going to go a long way then the equilibrium constant will be large. 
And in order for an equilibrium constant to be large then this delta G is going to have 
to have a large negative sign. So if the reaction -- -- is favorab le then K equilibrium 
will be large and  the delta G prime zero w ill have, at least within the sca le of an 
activation energy, a large negative value. And let me give you a couple of examples. 

When we ta lked about carbohydrates, I briefly told you sucrose was what we call a 
disaccharide, two sugars joined together. What do we do when we join two things 
together pretty much usua lly in nature? You split out a molecule of water. So we 
take a molecule of glucose, a molecule of fructose, both carbohydrates, stick them 
together and we get tab le sugar. If we want to reverse that reaction we have to put 
in a molecule of water and we can run it the other way. 

We get g lucose p lus fructose. The K equilibrium for that reaction is 140,000. The 
delta G prime zero is minus seven kiloca lories per mole. So that's an examp le of 
what I was just telling you, a  fairly large negative va lue. If we think about a reaction 
that's not favorable, here's acid ic acid. That's what makes vinegar sour. And the 
hydrogen ion can come off here to g ive you a hydrogen ion and the negative ion of 
acid ic acid or acetate ion. 

The equilibrium constant for that one is, what is  it, I think two  times ten to the 
minus five. So only a little tiny bit of the acid ic acid actua lly ionizes. And the K 
equilibrium constant then, excuse me, the delta G prime zero is p lus 6.3 kilocalories 
per mole. So buried in this examp le is not show ing you that a reaction that's 
unfavorab le w ill have a positive free energy associated w ith it, whereas one that's 
favorab le w ill have a negative free energy. 

This is also sort of telling you why you don't die when you put sa lad dressing on your 
salad, because if acidic acid ionized as thoroughly as sulfuric acid and you put an 
equiva lent amount of sulfuric acid on our salads none of us would be here. It's only a 
little tiny bit that's going, and so that's what's happening. So what this really sets us 
up for is this fundamenta l prob lem in biology, and that is that this reaction here, you 
can see what it would go, this one doesn't go, but most of the reactions that you 
have to carry out  in biology demand an energy input because they just won't go. 

We could sort of force this a little b it. We could  raise the concentration of the 
reactions and it would g ive us a little bit more product, but that's not a useful 
solution to a ll the things. So this was a really fundamenta l problem that had to be 
solved in evolution in order for life to ever exist. And  I'll g ive you just an examp le. If 
we consider taking a couple of molecules of g lutamate, which is one of the amino 
acids we ta lked about, a couple of molecules of amino and making it into a couple of 
molecules of g lutamine. 

Now, this is an amino acid needed for making proteins. This is an amino acid needed 
for making proteins. The cell has to have both of them. Glutamate has two 
methylene groups and then one carboxyl group that's one of the acid amino acids. 
And g lutamine the side cha in -- -- is now amid. The delta G prime zero associated 
with this reaction is plus seven kiloca lories per mole, so it's as unfavorab le a lmost as 
that one we're looking at. 

In fact,  it's worse than the one we're looking at over there. The reason that this is 
sort of pushing the thing uphill energetica lly is that the electrons here actually 
distribute themselves back and forth. So you can kind of think of the molecule as 
going back and forth between these two  forms. And that makes it more stab le. And 
when you stick on the amine group to make the amid it cannot do that, and so 
you're actua lly pushing everything energetica lly uphill. 

So how does a cell accomp lish this? There's energy available. If we consider what 
happens with C6H12O6 going to two lactate the delta G prime zero associated with 
that is minus 50 kilocalories per mole. So the cell has got a lot of energy out of 
making even that simp le conversation of a sugar molecule into two lactate. But it 
somehow has to figure out how to use that energy in order to drive these 
unfavorab le reactions. 

And the solution, which is really one of the secrets to  life, is to use coup led  reactions 
-- -- with a common intermediate. And if you look outside a cell, as Lavoisier d id or 
Pasteur did, this is what you'd see. But  if you could look inside the cell and see 
what's happening when that conversion is being made you'd discover that the full 
reaction looks like this. It's the sugar molecule p lus two molecules of ADP p lus two 
molecules of inorganic phosphate are going to give two molecules of lactate p lus two 
molecules of ATP. 

What's ATP? It's a ribonucleotide. That's ADP. And what happens when you make 
ATP is an extra phosphate gets added onto that end of the molecule. So by having 
yet another phosphate on here you've got a whole row of negative charges. This is a 
molecule in which the various parts are not happy to be together because all these 
negative charges would like to push apart so when you break the bond of ATP then 
energy is released. 

So using ATP is a way of sort of storing chemical energy so you can use it in some 
other kind of context. And so by burning it, by carrying out the reaction in this way a 
cell is able to not only make a molecule of sugar, glucose into two lactate, it's ab le to 
generate ATP along the way. And the delta G prime zero for this reaction is minus 34 
kilocalories per mole. 

So even though  it's taking out some of that energy and putting it in ATP, this is a 
reaction that goes very, very efficiently. Then instead of trying to carry out just that 
reaction, what the cell is actually doing is taking the two g lutamate plus the two 
molecules of ammonia plus two ATP. And then this  is converting it to two glutamine 
plus two water. I think I fa iled to put that in here so you can correct it back there. 

Plus two ADP plus two molecules of inorganic phosphate. And so the Pi very 
commonly used in b iochemistry to denote just inorganic phosphate  ion. So what's 
happen here then are these two reactions going on. This reaction now, because ATP 
is involved, is now favorable, and the delta G for this reaction is minus nine 
kilocalories per mole. 

So by having an ATP hydrolyzed as part of the reaction mechanism, this reaction that 
used to be unfavorab le is now favorable. And then the kind of cute thing then is if 
you sum this all up, the ATPs and the ADPs are on both sides of the equation so they 
just drop out. And what you're left with is C6H12O6 p lus the two g lutamines plus two 
ammonias going to g ive two g lutamines, excuse me, two lactate plus two g lutamines 
plus the two waters. 

And the delta G prime zero for this is minus 43 kilocalories per mole. So  this is not, 
you can think of  it as using energy in the form of ATP like this a little the way we use 
money in our society. I do some work at MIT. I'm not given food to eat or TV to 
watch the Super Bow l. Instead I'm given money, then I go to the store, I give them 
the money, I end up with the food or the stuff. 

And if you're watching it from the outside you see me do work at school and  then 
food, TV or whatever shows up at home. But what's happening is the money is 
serving as a common intermediate in those transactions. And that's what basically 
ATP is in the cell. It's energy money. And in making ATP the cell has to take this 
ribose with an adenine on it, I think I d idn't put the adenine on here I rea lize. 

The adenine is sitting on the ribose now. There are two phosphates, both of which 
have a negative charge on them. And to create that third bond it has to push it 
together. It's a very sort of an intrinsica lly unstable molecule. When you break the 
bond it will give you energy back. And that's one of the really amazing secretes to 
life, and that's the underlying principal of why it is that life can go forward. 

Now, the second issue that we need to quickly address here is -- -- not only can a 
reaction go, which  is what thermodynamics tells us, but how can  fast can it go. And 
this ep itomizes the problem  that all chemica l reactions face because litera lly every 
chemical reaction that you carry out involves bringing a couple of entities together. 
And as they get closer and closer and closer they don't want to be there so you have 
to sort of push them together in some kind of way or make sure they have enough 
energy to get together. 

And that's what we see represented here. And that's a special term called the 
activation energy. It's given the term delta G with a double-dagger. And that is what 
-- It's the size of that activation energy that limits how fast chemica l reactions can 
go. So the solution you use  in chemistry, most of you, is you use a cata lyst. And the 
cata lyst doesn't change the outcome of the reaction. 

It just changes how  fast you get there. So there are many reactions you've heard 
about in chemistry. Just stick the thing at 500 degrees centigrade, put in a piece of 
platinum, and now the reaction w ill go a whole lot faster. By heating it up molecules 
have more energy. So if they have more energy they can get closer together just 
from that. And then what the platinum surface would do is a llow the molecules to 
both stick and that would bring them in proximately and also help them come 
together. 

Well, you cannot ra ise the temperature in a biologica l system, but still you have to 
overcome this. But the principa l then, what you have to do when you carry out a 
cata lyst, what any catalyst would do  is that it lowers this activation energy. And if 
you lower the activation energy then enough of the molecules, just at whatever 
cond ition they're in w ill have enough energy to be ab le to go. 

It won't change the size of the drop. It just changes how fast you reach that final 
equilibrium. And there are two forms of b iological -- Two molecules that are 
biolog ical catalysts. One of the molecules you know is enzymes. Enzymes are made 
of a protein. We spent a bunch of time working at that. One of the things I showed 
you the very first day, this is a thing made by the anthrax bacterium, anthrax lethal 
factor. 

What it actually is, it's a protein and it's an enzyme that's able to cata lyze the 
cleavage of certa in peptide bonds in proteins in our body. And in particular it goes 
after molecules that are involved in signa ling processes inside of cells. And if we 
don't have those then we die. More recently it was d iscovered that RNA can be a 
cata lyst. And these are ca lled, if you have an RNA that's a catalyst it's called a 
ribozyme. 

And these seemed pretty exotic for a little while they first discovered the idea that a 
piece of RNA could serve as a cata lyst in a b iologica l system, but it eventua lly turned 
out that the ribosome, which we'll talk about in some deta il which is the protein 
synthesiz ing machinery that creates those peptide bonds between each of the amino 
acids to make the proteins. It's a b ig conglomeration of RNA shown in gray and a 
bunch of different proteins that are shown in yellow, but the actual formation of the 
peptide bond, the thing that makes all proteins is actually cata lyzed by a piece of 
RNA. 

And so the ribosome is actually a  ribozyme. And it's ironic in a sense that a p iece of 
RNA is cata lyz ing the bond that makes proteins possible. So we'll finish this up and 
get in then to g lycolysis which is the most evolutionary ancient of these energy-
producing systems on Monday. OK?
