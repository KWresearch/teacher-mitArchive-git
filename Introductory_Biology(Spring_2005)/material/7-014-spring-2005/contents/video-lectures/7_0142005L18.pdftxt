Transcript â€“ Lecture 18 

All righty. So we've been talking about, the last time we talked about the d ifferent 
ways that this extraord inary process ca lled evolution has resulted in different ways 
that organisms exploit the carbon and energy sources that are available on earth. 
And as we talked about that we find that whatever is thermodynamically possib le in 
terms of redox grad ients in the environment you w ill find an organism that has 
evolved to exploit it. 

And one thing I haven't mentioned to you guys yet -- Maybe I've mentioned it but I 
haven't driven  it home is that in the microb ial world  right now 99.9% of the microbes 
that live on earth have never been cultivated. So it's a vastly unknown universe, the 
deta ils. So the metabolic pathways that I'm describing here are just the tip of the 
iceberg in terms of what's possible. 

So last time we were talking at the b iochemical sca le. This time we're now going to 
sca le up and think of these b iochemical processes on a g lobal level. And we're going 
to talk about primary productivity which is really just another word for the collective 
photosynthesis of all of the photosynthesizers on earth. So who are the dominant 
primary producers? Well, we've a lready ta lked about this. And just to get ourselves 
oriented let's think of in water the primary photosynthetic organisms, the primary 
producers are phytoplankton. 

And let's just  look at one phytop lankton cell, OK? This is a sing le cell so this would be 
maybe ten microns in size. And inside that cell we have a chloroplast, and you've 
learned all this in other lectures and including my lectures, which takes up CO2 and 
evolves oxygen and makes sugars which go to, what's the organelle where 
resp iration takes place? M itochondria. 

Which goes to the mitochondrion and is respired. CO2 is evolved and oxygen is taken 
up. So this  little sing le cell gets through life through photosynthesis primarily, but it 
also  takes the products of photosynthesis and burns them inside the cell. So this is 
what we call respiration. And it's important to remember that even photosynthetic 
organisms respire, OK? But then there's this whole other group of organisms that 
last time we ca lled heterotrophs that can only respire. 

They rely on the photosynthetic product from photosynthetic organisms. So that's in 
water. And then on land the ma in primary producers, productivity are plants. And 
we'll just symbolize these as a tree. And we all know that the tree takes up CO2, 
evolves oxygen. If you b low this up, you just take a leaf, OK? That's a b lowup. And 
then you blowup aga in and take a cell from the  leaf. 

This cell is identical in function to the single microscopic phytop lankton cell, OK? So 
the process in both of these ecosystems, this could be grass, it could be moss,  it 
could be anything else, the process is the same in terms of what's involved in 
productivity. OK. Now, you have a handout for this  lecture that has a lot of the 
definitions that I'm going to now very briefly put on the board. 

Oh, I should tell you also that in the last ten minutes of the  lecture I'm going to 
show you another incredib le clip from  the Blue P lanet series that I showed you last 
time so you have something to look forward to. So let's define some terms. Biomass 
we're going to call B. And as I said this is all in the handout. So I'm just going to g ive 
you the short version here. And  the units of this can be of course anything, but 
normally  it's something like grams carbon per meter squared. 

And what does that mean? Well, it means if you have, in a terrestrial ecosystem, OK, 
where you have trees, it would mean that you would ca lculate the b iomass. You'd 
take a square meter and you'd integrate up and collect a ll of the biomass in that 
surface area, OK? So that's what that means. So grams carbon in that square meter. 
For an aquatic ecosystem it's the opposite. 

You take a square meter of the surface water, let's put some waves on here, and you 
integrate all the way down. How far? When will you not have anymore primary, oh, 
no, b iomass? When will you no  longer have any more photosynthetic biomass  in the 
oceans or in a lake? Pycnocline. Oh, that's a good answer. Not necessarily, though. 
But it often corresponds to that. The pycnocline  is a density grad ient in aquatic 
ecosystems. 

But what is absolutely essentia l for photosynthesis? L ight. Light. So you go down 
until there's no light. Absolutely. There won't be any photosynthesis where there's no 
light. This is the one thing we know  for sure, OK? And that's usually in the oceans 
around 200 meters. And in lakes it depends on how rich they are. In the Charles 
River it's about one meter because it's such a mess. 

In fact, well, I shouldn't say a mess, but it's very productive. In  fact, legend has it, 
and I don't know if this is true, that it's actua lly safe to swim in the Charles  in terms 
of the water quality, but the reason you're not supposed to swim is because the 
visib ility is so bad that if anything happened they'd never find you. But I don't know 
if that is true. 

That could be an urban  legend. OK, so we're going to define gross primary 
productivity. GPP, gross primary productivity is the rate of photosynthesis -- -- and 
grams carbon per meter squared per year. And of course the units here are not, the 
absolute units, this could be per day and this could be per square millimeter if you 
wanted, but the units are amount per unit area per unit time, OK? And then we're 
going to define the resp iration rate, the respiration of the autotrophs. 

So this would be the respiration rate of the photosynthetic organisms, which is why 
we ca ll them R sub A. And that's going to have the same units, OK? So it's grams 
carbon per meter squared per year respired. And net primary productivity is then 
gross primary productivity minus R sub A so net primary productivity of an 
ecosystem is the amount of carbon CO2 that's drawn into the system through 
photosynthesis minus the amount that was respired by the plants, by the organisms 
that did the photosynthesis. 

In a sense, you can think of it as the amount of carbon that actua lly goes into a plant 
grow ing, OK,  that goes into the biomass of a tree or that goes into the division of a 
sing le celled phytoplankton into  two phytop lankton. And then a lot of that is lost 
through resp iration. OK. We can also define mean residance time -- -- as MRT, which 
is the biomass d ivided by the net primary productivity. 

So what are the units of the mean residance time? It should be obvious but -- Years, 
right, or time. Mean residence time is time. And that's rea lly, if you want to think 
about it, if you think of yourself as a carbon atom that's drawn into a tree through 
photosynthesis, it's the average amount of time you will spend, your one atom in 
that tree. OK? It's the average residence, the mean residence time. 

Well, actua lly, that's wrong, right? It's not the amount of time that you, that one 
atom will spend, but it's on average the amount of time that atoms will spend in the 
tree. OK. And then the fractional turnover -- -- is equal to one over the mean 
residence time. And it has the units of obviously years to the minus one. And it's the 
fraction, if you think of a tree again, it's the fraction of the carbon in that tree that is 
renewed by new carbon every year. 

Now, these two concepts w ill become very important again when we start to talk 
about globa l b iogeochemical cycles. And we'll ta lk about the residence time, the 
various elements in various components in the earth system. OK. So now  let's go on 
and look at, first of all, I should have shown this slide last time. I'm trying to not 
walk around too much because this fellow is filming me or filming these classes. 

But we should briefly take a look at the absorption spectrum of all of the p lants in 
the b iosphere. Could we turn the lights down a little? Or I guess I'm in charge of 
that. There. A little bit better maybe. This is the absorption spectrum of the pigment 
chlorophyll, chlorophyll A that is the pigment that a ll green plants have and they use 
to absorb sunlight. And you'll notice that over the course of evolution all of these 
white bands are accessory pigments. 

That d ifferent organisms have evolved to a lso capture light. And they pass on that 
energy to the chlorophyll molecule. And the point is that if you look across all of the 
visib le  light and even beyond there are p igments that have evolved to capture that 
solar energy collectively in the ecosystem. OK, so let's  look at, now we're going to 
look at world net primary productivity. So essentially photosynthesis on a global 
sca le. 

And I'm going to tell you right up front. These numbers are extremely approximated. 
And I've taken these numbers from various textbooks. Your textbook doesn't even 
have a table like this in it. In fact, your textbook is very weak in this section of 
biology. But there are always tradeoffs in choosing textbooks. So I've taken this from 
textbooks and I've rounded off these numbers. And so I just want you to go through 
and understand the structure of the table. 

The idea is not to memorize particular numbers but understand and have a  feeling 
for the relative amounts of productivity in different ecosystems. So,  first of a ll, here's 
our units of grams per year, world net primary productivity. These are grams of 
carbon, OK? And if we first look at the total amount on  land, in this particular table is 
177 versus the marine total is 54. 

But the new estimates, I've taken this out of sort of more primarily literature than 
textbooks, really show these numbers to be more like this. That shows you how 
variable this is. It changes every decade. Show ing that the amount of photosynthesis 
in the oceans is roughly on par w ith the amount on land. And to remind you of our 
units here, weight-wise this is 50 to 70 b illion Volkswagen's worth of carbon. 

I mean that's a lot of carbon every year that is going into these ecosystems. OK, so 
let's look and d issect the table a  little bit. Looking at trop ica l forests like the 
rainforest in the Amazon that are some of the most productive ecosystems in the 
world. You can see that over here their net primary productivity per meter squared is 
2,000. And then you look down here at the open ocean which on a per meter 
squared basis, a very unproductive ecosystem, there are tiny little phytop lankton, is 
100. 

But looking  further, before I get to the but which is the punch line. That's the troub le 
with animation. The biomass in the tropical forest is enormous, obviously trees, 
whereas the b iomass in the open ocean is very tiny. But if we look at the percent of 
the surface of the earth that is covered by these two different ecosystems the open 
ocean is huge compared to the tropical forest. 

So on a g lobal scale, because of the aeria l coverage here these two ecosystems 
contribute equa lly, OK? So  it's a combination of net primary productivity and the 
coverage of the g loba l ocean. OK. Let's go back to that for a minute. So let's -- --
talk about turnover times or mean residence times. Just eyeballing it, can you g ive 
me an estimate in terms of days, months, years, decades, centuries, order of 
magnitude for the mean residence time of carbon in a ll the phytoplankton in a 
marine ecosystem? Is it days, months, years, centuries, decades? Well, don't guess. 

Well, you can guess but minutes is wrong. So having guessed minutes is wrong now 
you use your analytica l bra in and you look at this, mean residence time, which is 
biomass d ivided by net primary productivity. Here's the b iomass. Round that off. And 
here's the net primary productivity. And the units here is years. Like a month d id I 
hear? I didn't hear. R ight. It's about one-tenth of year which is about a month. About 
a month. 

Does everybody follow that? It's just to round this off, five over 50 is 0.1, biomass 
over NPP. How about for the terrestrial ecosystem, what's the average amount of 
time a carbon atom spends in the average tree? Years, right? Decades. Many years. 
Maybe decades to centuries. This is a way we think about these things. We don't 
have an exact number. But you want to get an order of magnitude feeling. 

So carbon is turning over very, very fast  in the marine ecosystem but very slow ly in 
the terrestria l ecosystem. And the simple way to think about that  is that 
phytoplankton don't have trunks, but there's a more complicated way to think about 
it. OK, so now, a ll of this primary productivity that we've made, a ll of this 
photosynthesis, as we talked about, is the base of the food webs in a ll ecosystems. 

And so we're going to start to dissect this. This is a marine food web show ing 
phytoplankton that are eaten by zooplankton. We used to talk about food chains, but 
we well now that it's not a cha in. It's really a very complex web and very hard to put 
organisms and assign them to particular sections. Phytop lankton are eaten by 
zooplankton. Zooplankton are eaten by worms. You've got blue crabs, barnacles, and 
the top predators shore b irds and sea bass. 

Now, an important part of these food webs is a lso all of the carbon, the primary 
productivity that is not eaten while it's a live. So some things just d ie, right? You 
have dead carbon lying around. And that dead carbon  falls into what's ca lled a 
different food web, the detritus food web. And we're going to talk about that. And it 
comes from all of these d ifferent components in the food web. 

So now we're going to more analytica lly look at the flow of carbon. And when we talk 
about carbon we are a lso talking about energy, right? Carbon and energy are the 
same thing. I mean they're interconvertab le. So we're going to look at the flow of 
carbon from the phytoplankton to the zooplankton through that trophic level. And to 
do this we have to ta lk about some definitions. 

And aga in this is in your handout so I'm not going to write all this on the board but 
we'll just wa lk through this. The flow of carbon or energy through a trophic level, 
which is one of these links, OK? This is one trophic  level. This is the next trophic 
level. Or you can also think of this as an organism. This type of analysis app lies to 
both. And we start out with the productivity at trophic level and minus one, OK? And 
so the first would be primary productivity coming into the system. 

Some of that productivity, some of that carbon is not ingested by the next trophic 
level. That's lost as dead organic matter, detritus, whatever we want to ca ll it. So 
that's D sub n the portion not consumed. Then some of it is  ingested by the 
organism, I sub n. And then some fraction of that is assimilated by the organism. 
That means it's taken into its biochemistry and goes toward building b iomass. 

And some of it is lost as feca l matter produced,  that's F sub n. And urine would also 
be a part of this, waste products. And then some of it is then, the rest of it is then 
available, oh, some of it, this is important, is lost as respiration. And then the rest is 
available as productivity for the next trophic level. OK. So different types of 
organisms. First, before we get to that, using this analysis we can start to define 
efficiencies of energy conversion through this system. 

And this is because different types of organisms assimilate carbon with d ifferent 
efficiencies. And that is important in the flow of carbon through different types of 
ecosystems. So let's look at the first efficiency that would be I, ingested, reflecting 
the amount that's ingested relative to the amount that's available. And this is ca lled 
the exploitation efficiency, OK? I sub n d ivided by P sub n minus one. 

The next one similarly would be A sub n, the amount that's assimilated  relative to 
the amount that's ingested. And that is the assimilation efficiency. And  fina lly the 
amount that goes to the next trophic level divided by the amount that's assimilated, 
which is the production efficiency, the amount that actually goes to productivity that 
is assimilated. And these a ll multiplied together give you the ecolog ica l efficiency. 

And that is sometimes called the trophic transfer efficiency. That's the amount of 
carbon that is basica lly lost as you go  through one trophic level. And usua lly, and 
we'll talk about this in a minute, this is 10% to 20% actually makes it through the 
system, and the rest is lost to resp iration or detritus or feca l matter. OK, so let's talk 
about now how d ifferent organisms vary in terms of efficiencies. 

We have, in terms of the exploitation efficiency,  if you're talking about, for example, 
tree insects. So insects feeding on trees is about 1% to 10%. They don't take that 
much of the tree. If it's grass to animals it's more like 20%. And if it's phytop lankton 
to zooplankton it's more like 20% to 40%. In other words, zooplankton harvests 
much of the primary productivity, no, almost half of the productivity that the 
phytoplankton have made. 

OK. What about assimilation efficiency? How does this vary between organisms? 
Well, this one, you can think about it as if you eat food that is, I was going to say not 
you, but it is true, we are all animals so it applies to us, too. If you eat food that is 
similar in composition to your own bod ily composition you're more efficient at 
assimilating  it because you don't have to break  it down as much and reorganize  it. 

So herb ivores, organisms that eat plant matter are 20% to 50% efficient in their 
assimilation. But carnivores is more like 80%. Because you are meat and if you eat 
meat you don't have as much waste than if you eat a lot of fiber. So there are big 
differences there. And then in terms of, that is not a value judgment on whether you 
should eat meat or not. I just want to make that very clear. What? OK. But later on 
we'll talk about the difference between eating meat globally and being vegetarians in 
terms of utilizing primary productivity on the earth. 

But in terms of production efficiency you have warm-b looded organisms having a 2% 
production efficiency. Whereas cold-blooded have a 40% production efficiency. Why 
would that be? Yes. If you're warm-blooded, does anybody know the technical term 
for that? It is if you are homeotherm. Or what did you say? Endothermic. I'm not 
sure. I think that's chemistry. 

It sounded good, though. So there are homeotherms and heterotherms. It doesn't 
matter. The point is that these have to ma inta in their body temperature like we do. 
That takes a lot of energy. Whereas, these go with the flow so to speak, that 
technical term. But that doesn't take as much energy. If it's cold they just let their 
body get cold. They don't burn, burn, burn to keep the temperature constant. 

OK, so  that's how organisms differ. Now let's move on to the next chapter in which 
now we are going to look at -- We were looking at the flow through one trophic level. 
Now we're going to connect a whole bunch of trophic levels. We're going to look at 
the flow of energy through this component of this food web and do a more thorough 
analysis. OK, so this gets kind of messy but let's start here. 

I better use the powerful one. OK, so each one of these is what we call a  trophic 
level. And these are the primary producers, the photosynthetic organisms. Here is 
our gross primary production absorbing sunlight. Some of that is lost to heat. Some 
of that is lost to resp iration. Here is our little R sub A, remember? Right here. And 
some of it, the net primary productivity is available for ingestion at the next trophic 
level which are the herbivores. 

So a ll we're doing here is gang ing up a whole bunch of those individua l analyses. 
And then the next trophic levels are the carnivores and then the second carnivores. 
And the number of links you have here is something that is obviously determined by 
the efficiency of transfer from one to another and the total amount of energy that 
comes into the system. 

So here in our ecosystem we have carbon being lost at each step to detritus. And 
you have feces at each link. This all goes down and becomes part of the detritus food 
web. And in that you have two forms of carbon. You have particulate organic carbon 
which is p ieces of dead carbon floating around, dead leaves, dead phytoplankton, 
whatever. And then you also have d issolved organic carbon. 

When these p lants die and the phytop lankton die they burst open. And the g lucose 
and amino acids and all of that dissolve into the water in the system. And that 

becomes d issolved organic carbon which is available for this microbial food web, an 
entirely d ifferent food web that's coup led to the system. So you have the detritivore. 
This the grazing  food web here. The waste from  that goes to the detritivores and the 
microbes. 

And then whatever is left over after that is ca lled refractory carbon. That means 
none of the creatures are able to break it open and really get energy out of it. And in 
the b ig p icture what is this? We talked about it actually last time. Fossil fuel, exactly. 
This is the carbon that actually accumulates over time that when ecosystems are 
finished processing all of the primary production. 

OK, so I'm trying to time this right so that we make sure we have time for the 
movie. So let's  look at a couple of ways we can think about this. Let's just compare. 
If we look at the open ocean ecosystem versus the trop ica l forest. And the average, 
oh, I forgot one thing. OK. If we take now the gross primary productivity. And I'm 
going to circle all of the resp irations. See the purple here? So this is all the carbon 
that's being  fixed . 

This is that is lost to resp iration. And we can define a new parameter which is net 
ecosystem production. And that is gross primary production minus the resp iration of 
all of the autotrophies, R sub A, minus the resp iration of all of the heterotrophic 
components of the system. So that would be the herb ivores, carnivores, detritivores, 
microorganisms. That's a ll the carbon that's respired and lost to CO2. 

So you can add this to this. So we'd have net ecosystem production. Production 
equa ls GPP minus RA minus the sum of a ll the heterotrophs. Now, in very mature 
ecosystems this net ecosystem production is essentially nothing. All right? 
Everything that's produced is consumed. For example, in a trop ica l ra inforest you 
don't have a huge buildup of organic carbon in a trop ica l ra inforest. Everything that's 
produced is basica lly consumed and this is zero. 

But in a young forest, say a plantation at the extreme where you p lant trees and 
they're increasing in b iomass, then obviously this net ecosystem production is a 
positive number. What if net ecosystem production is a negative number? It won't be 
there for long, right? You've got to have things photosynthesizing net at least 
enough to maintain the ecosystem. I mean you can have it for a transient for not 
any steady state. 

OK. All right. Talking about ecological efficiencies aga in. If we talk about the average 
-- The average ecolog ica l efficiency of the open ocean is about 25% and of the 
trop ical ra in  forest is about 5%. So the average number of trophic levels, that's 
basically the number of links in the food web in these two systems is about 7.1 and 
3.2. In other words, when you have more efficiency of transfer from one  link to 
another you can have more links obviously. 

So getting back to humans again, and this gets back to in terms of what we might 
think about as a globa l human society. If you go from wheat to man you lose 90% of 
the energy in that transfer. If you go from wheat to cows to man you lose 90% here 
and you lose 90% here. So obviously in terms of feeding the world it's much better 
to go d irectly from wheat to humans than to go  from wheat to cows to humans. 

You all know this but it's important to remember that. And unfortunately the trend in 
the world is to go more from here to here instead of the other way around. Just 

something to remember in terms of the application of this knowledge. OK. Finally 
very quickly I'm going to skip over this and go to another way to look at what we've 
been talking about. 

It's just another diagram of the same thing. You have the photosynthetic organisms 
that the entire world depends on, this productivity for food and  fiber. And that most 
of that is lost through resp iration and the rest goes to the other organisms including 
detritivores. So a b ig question is how much of this globa l primary productivity, this 
global photosynthesis have humans taken over? It's really hard to answer that 
question, OK, but a lot of ecologists have been working very hard at understand ing 
the fraction of g lobal photosynthesis that has been what's called co-opted by 
humans. 

And the estimates range from 10% to 55%. The amount that we use d irectly as food 
or fuel or fiber or timber is not that great, but there's a lot of productivity that's 
diverted as crop waste, burning, et cetera. And land conversion obviously uses up a 
lot of habitat and productivity. So the significant point here is that as we co-opt this 
primary productivity we change dramatically all of the food webs that rely on it, and 
that is what is part of the path to extinction of a lot of species. 

And the big question is how much can we co-opt? I mean we're on the road to taking 
over the primary productivity of the earth, there's no question, comp letely. Unless 
we set up reserves that's it, that's where we're marching. Now, when we're in charge 
of it, is it going to function the way we need it to function to mainta in our 
atmosphere and to provide us with the food and fiber that we need? That's still an 
open question. 

OK, so now I'm going to show you this really neat DVD because these p ictures of 
food webs are deadly dull and don't represent anything at a ll of what the reality is 
like. So I'm going to show you three weeks in the life of a rea l food web. And I want 
you to think about two things when you're watching it. Don't just think you're at 
home in  front of your TV watching a nature show and going bra in dead or something. 

Think about what you've learned in this class. So think about the gigatons of carbon 
that are flowing through this system. More importantly this entire food web and 
everything that's going on in it is orchestrated by the information in the genes of the 
organisms in the food web. That's the information content that structures this whole 
thing. And how it's all orchestrated and coordinated and happens the same way 
more or less every year is absolutely mind blowing as far as I'm concern and a 
major, major cha llenge for ecology and  for molecular ecology. 

OK.
