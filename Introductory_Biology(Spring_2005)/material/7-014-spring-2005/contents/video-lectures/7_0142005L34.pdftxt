Transcript â€“ Lecture 34 

OK, so  the last lecture we were talking about competition, and the result of 
competition between organisms. And I d idn't quite finish, so I just want to finish up 
on that lecture, and then will move on to predation, an interaction between two 
species which results in increasing the fitness and one, and decreasing the fitness in 
the other. But let's just finish up with competition. We were ta lking about character 
displacement and beak depths. And we have shown that when you have two closely 
related birds w ith the same beak size, if they live on islands separate from one 
another, they compete for the same food. But if you live on an island together, what 
happens is that you have this character displacement where the beak of what will get 
bigger and the beak of the other w ill get sma ller. So they can exp loit d ifferent food 
resources. 

And this character d isp lacement is the beginning of species formation. And this is 
very common on islands. And these are the famous finches from the Ga lapagos 
Islands that Darw in first based his theory of evolution, or it was an important part of 
his theory of evolution, where he rea lized that there must have been an ancestor 
finch, that a ll of these other finches that had different representation on different 
islands evolved from through the slow change in traits that is selected as a  result of 
different combination of species being together or alone in different islands. And  this 
is what's called adaptive radiation. And  this is really a powerful mechanism  for 
evolution. 

This is the Ga lapagos finches, but you a lso see this  in an extreme form in Hawaii 
among the honey creepers showing this incredib le diversity of beak types that have 
evolved to exploit d ifferent kinds of food. OK, so before we go on to predation, I just 
want to walk you through an evolutionary scenario, so that you can see how this 
might work on an  island, Archipelago. So this is the mainland, and we're going to 
start w ith an ancestor species, A, and our Archipelago is going to have three islands. 
OK, let me draw this. 

Here's the same three islands. So this is time passing. So as we move, these are the 
same three islands as a function of time passing, OK? So at the beg inning, we're 
going to have our founder species flying and colonizing the island. OK, so A is on this 
island. And so, the first thing that happens is that A evolves and becomes B. So each 
one of these is just the name of the species, OK? This is species A, species B, 
through what's known as the founder effect. And that is when you have a few 
members of the species colonizing on this island. You have a tiny gene pool, and the 
genetic composition of this drifts such that it actually becomes a different species 
from the one on the ma inland. So, A becomes B. 

So the full arrow means becomes B on the islands through the founder effect. And 
now, we're going to have B migrate to a new  island. So, A is now B on this island, 
right? And B is going to colonize this island. And through that same founder effect, B 
becomes C. So let me just write what's happening here. B becomes C. I think you 
can see what's happening on one island, and then it migrates back. So, let's let C 
migrate back to where B is, and C a lso founds a new island. 

So, we're going to let C migrate here. So we end up with C and B here now ab le to 
compete w ith each other, C here and C here. OK, so we've got a new combination of 
species, and we are going to let C become D here due to the founder effect, and D is 
going to migrate over to  this island. So, C becomes E when with B because of 
character d isp lacement. So, C becomes E here when it's with B. 

So you end up w ith E and B on this  island. D is going to migrate to this island. So, 
we have C and D here. And, C has evolved to be D here. So, we a lso have C 
becomes D when alone. OK, so this is just a scenario we are making up. OK, you can 
make up any scenario. But it's to give you the idea of how this adaptive radiation 
comes about. So, starting with one sing le species on the ma inland, if you have an 
island archipelago where species can be isolated enough from each other to restrict, 
but not completely eliminate, the gene flow you can have this rapid adaptive 
radiation. So, evolutionary b iologists often study islands in order to study this 
phenomenon. 

OK, so just to summarize for competition, interspecific competition results in either 
competitive coexistence, which can be achieved either through niche differentiation. 
Do you remember, what was an example of that last time? The barnacles and the 
inner tida l. One took the high road, and one took the low  road. That's called niche 
differentiation, or character displacement. And this can happen very rap idly. 

I hesitate to tell you about rea lly interesting things that you don't have to know, but 
I w ill anyway. This is really interesting study by a couple at Princeton of the 
Galapagos finches. And they've shown that you can have character d isplacement of 
the islands over a period of one or two years, just depending on the amount of 
rainfa ll. So, it can happen very rap idly by just selecting for different character traits, 
or competitive exclusion, which is the case where the niche overlap is so great that 
one of the species comp letely outcompete the other. The examp le from last time was 
the zebra mussels and Gause's paramecia in the test tubes excluding the other. 

So, these are rea lly important ecological and evolutionary forces. The other thing I 
learned from your comments, which I was very heartened by, is that at  least one 
person rea lly liked the definition of the niche, of the N-d imensiona l hyper volume, 
which I have a lways loved and I think is fundamentally important because people 
throw around ecological niche in everyday language and think of it as a p lace in the 
environment. And  I think that a more robust definition is so much more useful. 

So, let's move onto predation, which  is a very strong evolutionary force. It can 
control population dynamics. It can shape community structure. We're going  to talk 
about each of these. It actually influences competition, which in turn shapes 
community structure. And it's a powerful evolutionary agent. In other words, it's 
very important in influencing natura lly selection. So, let's start w ith the classic, 
here's a classic predator-prey  interaction. There  is two wolves and a moose being 
attacked. The wolves are not evil. They're just getting their meal. OK, this  is a very 
famous classic study of the snowshoe hare, and lynx. 

Lynx is a cat: populations in northern Canada. And these data were collected by the 
Hudson Bay Company trapp ing records. So, it's really from the amount of anima ls 
that were actually trapped that these abundances come from. And that's where these 
coup led oscillations, this is the hare, and this  is the lynx show ing these couples 

oscillations with a roughly 11 year cycle. And people spend a lot of time trying to 
understand what was driving that oscillation. 

And mathematicians love these coupled oscillators. And so, the first attempt to 
model this kind of thing was using a very simple model. Remember we said the 
dN/dt equa ls rN? That's our exponential growth equation. And we a lso sa id before 
the dN/dt or that r is equa l to the birthrate (b) minus the death rate (d). OK, so 
grossly oversimp lifying the system, the first set of equations that were used to try to 
describe this, are if you use for the predator, you call the predator dN1/DT equa ls 
b1,N1 minus d1,N1. 

OK, so  that's just this equation. And they sa id, well, how do we mod ify this equation 
so that the growth rate of the predator is somehow a function of the density of the 
prey? Well, the easiest thing to do is just make it proportional, right? So what they 
do is put N2 in there. So, the prey population is going to be dN2/dt, and we're going 
to the same thing: b2,N2 minus d2,N2, and the question is how do we mod ify the 
prey growth rate equation so that it is somehow a function of the density of the 
predator? So what would you do? So here, this says the b irthrate of the predator is 
influenced. 

As prey density increases, the birthrate of the predator increases. How would you 
modify this equation so that the predator density has an effect on it? It's pretty 
obvious, but I'm trying to get you w ith me. Exactly. It would be the death term. As 
the predator numbers increase, the death term would go up. And it turns out that 
these are two coupled differential equations that make a beautiful oscillatory system, 
a couple oscillators, perfect oscillators like that. 

This is predator density. So that would be N1, N2, and this is time if you chart their 
density w ith time. And how many of you have actually had this in the course? Yeah, 
see? [LAUGHTER] And what courses have you had in it? D ifferential equations, yeah. 
Mathematicians love it. But rea l populations, predator and prey, don't really operate 
this way. I mean, you see these oscillations, but rarely can it be attributed solely to 
the interaction between the predator and the prey. 

There's usua lly many other factors. So, and  I'll just g ive you one example. So 
ecologists go ahead and say, OK, so what's rea lly going on? And here's an example. 
It turns out that in many cases, the food supply of the prey is oscillating. OK, so the 
availability of food to the prey oscillates, making the prey population oscillate, which 
then can drive an oscillation in the predator population. So, it's more than just the 
coup ling between the two. There are a lso an external oscillators driving both of 
them. And aga in, I'd like to try to address the role of experimentation. Here is an 
experiment done w ith rabbits. 

And I don't know what the predator was. It might have been, I'm not sure the 
predator was, but anyway, rabbits, in which through experimentation they increased 
the food supply to  the rabb its through fertilization. And they showed that, so this is 
the control. And this is the phase of the cycle in the hare population relative to the 
density in the controls. So, show ing that when the food supply was increased, the 
oscillation was still there. So, it wasn't only relieving the rabbits of food limitation, 
did not eliminate the oscillation, but if you'd excluded the predators, you still also 
had the oscillation there. And if you d id both of them, it increased the amplitude of 
the oscillation, relative to the control. 

So the conclusion  from this is that both food supply and the predation affected the 
oscillation. Another very classic experiment is the experiment by Huffaker back when 
people began to be enamored of these coup led differentia l equations. People wanted 
to test the hypothesis of those equations in the laboratory. And they tried to set up 
predator-prey systems in the lab, and see if they can get them to go in these 
coup led oscillations for many cycles. And Huffaker set up a system of a predatory 
mite and a prey mite. Ecolog ists like to use  insects as experimenta l systems because 
they're small and you can do it in the lab. 

And this one  lived on oranges. So it was an herb ivorous mite. And the predator 
obviously lived on mites. And he set up a very simple system in the lab of oranges, 
and introduced the predator and prey, and inevitably he got this, where prey would 
increase, and then the predator would increase, and would overshoot, and the prey 
would die, and the predator would d ie. So he only got one cycle, w ith a simple 
system could not get this to persist, well, that doesn't even qualify as a cycle. 

So he realized, so this is a simp le system. And he had a grid, which is shown up here 
in which he had oranges. And he had them interspersed w ith rubber balls to have a 
little bit of comp lexity  in the system. But he found with that design, he could not get 
the system to persist. So he hypothesized that the reason it wouldn't persist  is that 
it's much too simp le, not close enough to nature. So he introduced all kinds of 
complexity. 

He increased the size of his grid relative to the populations, which would g ive the 
prey mites more of a chance to get away from the predator. He put barriers of 
dispersa l, like Vaseline moats, and he actua lly put little launching pads for the prey. I 
don't know what they look like, diving boards, I don't know what they were, but little 
launching pads that just increased a lot of complexity so that  it gave the prey an 
ability to move around relative to the predator. And he was actua lly ab le to, this 
shows his results over 200 days. 

He was actually able to get three full cycles of the predator-prey oscillation. And up 
here, it just shows you that they're sort of a cat and mouse game going on. It shows 
you the location of the prey mites relative to the predator mites at these different 
points in time of this cycle, showing that they're moving around the system, and that 
the complexity allowed this coup led oscillator to persist. And of course, we present 
this because it was a classic experiment. It was a pioneering experiment, but I 
mean, there have been a  lot more since then. And of course, it has imp lications for 
stab ility of populations in the natura l world. 

As we make the natura l world less and less complex, it reduces the ab ility of 
populations that are engaged in these coupled oscillatory systems to persist. It 
increases the likelihood of extinction. So this was like a tiny little  localized extinction 
in his experimenta l system. Another classic example that's often cited about the role 
of predation in regulating population dynamics has to do with rubber plantations over 
here in Malaysia. D id I spell that right? That looks wrong. 

Oh well, is that OK? And I don't have any data for you. So this is just a story, but it's 
very compelling, and there  is data somewhere but I don't have a slide. But, in the 
first half of the century, in its rubber p lantations in Ma laysia  they had a tremendous 
diversity of  insects, but d idn't have any rea l serious problems w ith insect pests in the 
rubber p lantations. And,  in 1950, they had a small outbreak of defoliated caterp illars. 

And that was right about the time that DDT was invented and synthesized, and 
became ava ilable. And so, entomologists came down and sprayed the plantation with 
DDT hop ing to get rid of this caterp illar. In the next year, the outbreak got bigger. 
They sprayed more. The next year the outbreak got b igger. They sprayed more, and 
fina lly the whole thing was out of control. And they sa id what's going on here? We 
are killing these things, and it's getting bigger. To make a long story short, what 
they were doing, this is a cocoon. Oh boy. 

How do you spell cocoon? That's not right. Is that right? Anyway, you know what I 
mean. Caterpillars live in cocoons, and there was a, that's a wasp w ith a big, long 
organ that it lays its eggs. It needs some legs, doesn't it? OK, I made some front 
legs too. There. OK, so that's a wasp that lays its eggs in these caterp illar cocoons, 
and in doing so, kills caterpillars. And what they were doing with the DDT, is that 
they were killing the natural predator of the wasp. And the caterp illars themselves, 
while they were in the cocoon, were actually protected from the DDT. So the more 
they put on, the more they killed the wasp, and  the caterpillars were released from 
this controlling predation, and they had huge outbreaks. 

So, it's another example of  in nature it's really hard, you can't see what's controlling 
what until you d isrupt it. You have to experiment either inadvertently or on purpose 
because everything is dynamic and turning over. But it looks relatively stable. And 
that's why this  is so hard. And this is one of my favorite examples of this, because it 
brings together a lot of concepts that we've been ta lking about, is predation shapes 
community structure. And this is another example of introduced species. 

And this is St. John's Wort, which was introduced at California from Europe. And, it, 
so I'm going to draw a couple of habitats here. This is a forest, and this is a meadow. 
So this is grass, OK, this is trees. And these are St. John's Wort. So, it could grow 
equa lly well in the meadow and in the forest. And it was getting out of control so 
they introduced a beetle from Europe that feeds on St. John's Wort to try to bring it 
in to under control. And what they found was that the beetle, because the beetle's 
preferred hab itat was the meadow that St. 

John's Wort persisted in the forests but was eliminated from the meadow. Now, 
because the beetle prefers the sunny habitat of the meadow, so if you were an 
ecologist and you didn't know that this beetle had been introduced, you just walked 
into  this state, you knew nothing about the history, you wanted to study the 
ecological niche of St. John's Wort, you would say, well, I only find it in the forest. It 
must like cooler, wetter environments because you wouldn't really know that it was 
being controlled by the presence of this beetle. 

So, this  is a perfect examp le. If we draw the niche or two dimensions of the 
ecological niche of St. John's Wort, and we say that just on these two d imensions 
that this is the fundamental niche on the moisture light grad ient, in the presence of 
this beetle, the rea lized niche is only this low light, high moisture environment that 
you  find in the forest. OK, so in other words, to really understand what's regulating 
the ecology of a particular organism, you have to understand a ll of the other 
organisms that it's interacting w ith, and what their effect is on this. And again, that's 
why it's so impossible to do this without some form of experiment, either 
manipulative experiments like I described, or experiments done in a lab, or 
inadvertent experiments by introducing species. 

OK, now let's ta lk about a couple of other rea lly classic experiments that have been 
done. And these are experiments that have illustrated the concept of keystone 
predator. There are some predators and ecosystems that are what are ca lled 
keystones. And that is if you remove them, the entire structure of the community 
changes. There are some that if you move them, it doesn't have a dramatic effect, 
but there are certa in ones that are keystone predators that it does. And these, of 
course, are species that conservation biolog ists want to  first identify, and second 
conserve above others because there is a cascade of effects if something happens to 
them. 

A classic examp le of this was a study by Robert Payne many years ago in the inner 
tidal community. I'm not going to go into the details of that, but the rocky inner tidal 
community is made up of the starfish, which is called p isaster, one of the top 
predators. And there are a lso limpets, chitins, if you grew up in California you know 
probably what these are, mussels. 

These are invertebrates- like barnacles that stick to the ground, or stick to the rocks, 
and also a lgae that stick to the rocks. And Payne hypothesized that the predator was 
maintaining this diversity. And the way to test that hypothesis was to put a cage 
over everything and eliminate the predator from certa in areas. At what he showed 
was that that's what that ecosystem looks like if you eliminate the predator. You can 
see here, here's the a lgae. Here are some articles. 

This is a new textbook, see if you get the full story there, but there's a  lot of 
diversity of the small barnacle- like invertebrates. Then you eliminate the predator, 
and the mussels just completely take over. And  this is preemptive competition. They 
compete w ith everything else for space and nothing else can survive there. Another 
example of a keystone predator is the sea otter, which keeps the sea urchins in 
check in the bottom of the substrate, and if the sea otter is not there the sea urchins 
takeover and they exclude the kelp, the entire kelp forests and all the fishes that 
lives in the kelp  forests, and all of the d iversity of the ecosystem relies on the sea 
otter's ab ility to keep the sea urchin population in check. OK, so some of the best 
evidence for predation as an evolutionary agent, or something that's driving the 
natural selection of organisms, are these defenses that have evolved to avoid 
predation. 

In other words, if you're constantly under attack, your fitness w ill be increased by 
features that reduce your susceptibility to predation. So in this case, there are a lot 
of experiments. I'm going to show you a few, but a picture's worth a thousand words 
here. I'll show you some examples. Cryptic coloration is when a prey organism has 
color features that make it b lend in to the environment. 

So here's a very famous examp le that was actually in another inadvertent 
experiment. This is a moth that comes in two forms. This is ca lled the melanic form, 
which is dark b lack or gray, and this is the other form which  is much lighter. And 
here it is on a birch tree. You can see that this one blends it beautifully, whereas this 
one, if I were a predator looking for the moth, I would see this but I wouldn't see 
that. Here's the same two moths on another tree with darker bark showing that in 
this case, this one would be more fit in that one would be less fit. And there's a very 
famous study that I don't have time to go into, but it's a textbook, that showed 
experimentally the relative fitness between these two  forms, depending on the color 
of the tree trunks. And this whole example is ca lled industria l melanism because the 

reason this was noticed was that in areas of high industria lization the tree trunks are 
darker colored because of the a ir pollution. 

This is back in England back  in the days when there is a lot more a ir pollution. So, 
they were able to show a shift in the frequency of these two forms as a function of 
the amount of pollution and environment because their susceptibility to predation 
was reduced if this form dominated. That study  is actually rather controversia l now, 
so I won't teach you the deta ils. But you get the point. But these moths exist in 
these two forms. 

Here's another example that's rea lly convoluted that's in your textbook. So I'm not 
going to write it on the board. You can read about it there. But it's an examp le of 
what's ca lled the evolutionary arms race. And it has to do with Cottonwood trees. 
And Cottonwood trees produce a defense compound that the name of which is on the 
next slide: Soliccorten [SP?]. It doesn't matter what it's called,  it's a  toxic compound 
that makes the tree distasteful to predator. You don't think of predators of trees. The 
beaver is a  tree predator. It chops it down. 

So when a beaver chops it down, a Cottonwood tree, the Cottonwood tree sprouts 
new sprouts. And the resprouts have much higher concentrations of this toxic 
compound than the parent tree had. In other words, the tree has a mechanism. And 
I'm sure we don't understand that yet, but someday we'll understand  the genetic 
underp innings of this, the molecular biology of beaver defenses. But if  it's been  felled 
by a beaver, it increases the production of this toxin in the shoots that come out 
saying, OK, fool me once, but you're not getting to get me the next time. 

It means there's beavers around. But the interesting thing is that these shoots are 
much more susceptible to grazing by a leaf beetle. In other words, this  increased 
toxin, the shoots that have the increased toxin, are actually grazed more than the 
parent tree by this leaf beetle. So scientists went in and sa id, you know, what's 
going on here? This is weird. Why make a defense that makes you more vulnerable 
to a different predator? And what they showed by experiment was that these leaf 
beetles were using that toxin as a defense against the ants that want to eat them. 
So, they were less susceptible to predation by ants because they had taken in the 
toxin from the shoots. 

So, it's called the evolutionary arms race between predator and prey. In these 
systems get very complex. So here's the data that shows that, that the control trees, 
trees that haven't been  felled by a beaver compared to trees that have been felled 
by a beaver, and  resprouted trees have a much higher concentration of this toxin. 
And this is the larval survival time of these leaf beetles that these are from the 
control trees versus the browsed trees in the presence of the ants. OK, I'm going to 
skip that one. 

That ones in your book, too, which has an experiment showing that anti-predation 
mechanisms are induced by the presence of a predator. So I would encourage you to 
look at this in a textbook, this example. And then fina lly I'm just going to go through 
a series of p ictures that show all of the types of defenses that have been evolved as 
anti-predation devices. They are the obvious ones like cacti w ith spikes, or 
porcupines w ith spikes, octopi with ink defense. This is a caterpillar that has evolved 
to look like a snake, at least that's the way it looks to us. I mean that's a hypothesis, 
that the predation on this would be reduced because it looks like a predator itself. 

These are two different ones looking like a snake. And often, snakes have a bright 
colored thing on their ta il to draw attention to  the tail. If you're going to be attacked 
by a predator, you'd  rather have your ta il attacked than your head. So, this is a 
common motif in nature. And this is an  insect. This  is its head. And yet, if you're a 
predator you'd probably think this was its head. And aga in, whether that's been 
established by experiments, I don't know. So these are just examples. Moths often 
have features that look like eyes that what tends to ward off a predator. This is an 
interesting story that is in your readings that shows that there are just a few genes 
that control the phenotype of this particular butterfly. 

I think it's a moth, between having these spots and not having the spots. In the fall, 
when it's dry and it's more selective advantage to look like a leaf, they look like this. 
But at other times, they're visible anyway so their selective advantage is to have 
these eye spots that make them look like they have eyes. OK, I think it's time to 
quit, so we'll p ick this up next time, I promise you. Their wonderful pictures of the 
creatures in the deep sea  that are very evil looking predators that fish w ith their 
luminescent light organs.
