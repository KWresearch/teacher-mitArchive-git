Transcript â€“ Lecture 21 

So, we have another kind of very interesting piece of the course right now. We're 
going to continue to ta lk about genetics, except now we're going to ta lk about the 
genetics of d iploid organisms, which apart from bacteria, most of the organisms 
includ ing us are diploid. They have more than one copy of each chromosome, and so 
we'll go through a segment on this, and also ta lk about mitosis and meiosis, the 
centra l processes of cell division and the segregation of genetic material that 
underlie life as we know it. 

And then, were going to charge into a session of recombinant DNA, and some of 
these technolog ies, PCR and various things that you see in the newspapers a ll the 
time. And then, I'll finish up w ith the session on the immune system, which a few of 
you thought was surprising that bacteria  recomb ine. I'll tell you in that system  it will 
feel like science fiction relative to what I've told you up to now. 

It's an absolutely amazing system. So, we are going to start today w ith genetics of 
diploid organisms. So I'm going to go back to how this was first understood. And 
most of you have probably heard of Gregor Mendel, who d iscovered this, and surely 
some fraction of you have run into an exposure to this topic before. But in keep ing 
with what I'm trying to do in this course, could you guys watch out there? I think I'm 
just going to unp lug, yeah, it's OK. 

I think I'm just going to unp lug it for just a minute here. You've probab ly heard of 
Mendel. Some of you have seen these d ifferent squares. You might have memorized 
it from a textbook or something like that. I'm going to try and see if we can go 
through this material up another level of sophistication because, again, and  I'm 
saying, science d idn't just come down  from on high and end up w ith  facts in a 
textbook. 

What's in a textbook is somebody's effort to take a current state of understand ing 
which is based on experimentation and come up with models. And what you're 
seeing in the textbooks are the models such as they were as of the time the 
textbook was submitted for pub lication. Sometimes they change even before the 
textbooks get out. But anyway,  it's a process. 

Mendel was one of the starting peop le who started this process, rea lly a key figure, 
and a guy w ith an amazing  intellect. But before we start in, I just want to show you 
a couple of p ictures because these kind of knocked me over when I saw them. I 
don't know what kind of image you have of Mendel. You probably know he was a 
monk, and he d id something with peas, and he figured out this stuff about genetics. 

And most people probably carry around an image probab ly somewhat like this sort of 
romanticized draw ing. He was a monk all right, but it was at an Augustine monastery 
in Bruno in Austria that was a very major intellectual center. They even published a 
scientific journa l. They sent Mendel off to Vienna to go to university. While he was 
there, he stud ied physics, math, as well as botany. 

So he had, in many ways, a background that is very similar to you guys, very heavy 
on the quantitative physica l science, mathematical sort of background. And then he 
went on to do some experiments in b iology. And I think you maybe can get a sense 
of this. You can see a picture of what Mendel actually looked like. Here's one p icture 
of him. But the one that really blew me away, I have a p icture of the monks. 

Just think of what ever image you had of the monks that Mendel was at. Well there's 
a picture of them. To me, they look nothing so much like a group of university 
presidents or something sitting around for a portra it. And he traveled very w idely. 
Here he was on his way to London here. Here is a picture of him w ith a group of 
people on his way to, I think he was in Paris on his way to London. 

So this wasn't a  little isolated monk in a garden who stumb led across stuff. He was a 
rather sophisticated guy going after some interesting problems. And this was the 
garden in which he d id his experiments. Here's a picture of it. So this was a 
straightforward experimental setup  for these really amazing things he did. So, with 
that kind of background, Mendel was interested  in a prob lem of  inheritance. 

And people have been aware that traits were inherited. That was the whole principle 
of domesticating animals and domesticating crops, that if you took parents w ith 
certain characteristics and crossed them together, the offspring then had the tra its 
that were associated with the parents. And so people were ab le to get better 
domesticated animals or better domesticated crops. But up until then,  this mixing 
was thought of sort of like b lending liquids, stir together some green and red, and a 
little this and that. 

And it all stirred together. And as you'll see, what one of Mendel's great insights was, 
was that it wasn't like mixing liquids. And to study this problem, then, he picked a 
system. It wasn't that he was just fidd ling around with peas. He was a pretty 
sophisticated guy, and he p icked peas as an experimenta l organisms for three 
reasons. And so, why peas? Well one,  they were easy to grow, and that's still a 
major consideration of any model system that you want to use and science today. 

It's rea lly tricky to grow, it's very hard to work with. It was easy to pollinate in a 
controlled way. Just the structure of the pea flower makes it very easy to make sure 
to either put the pollen right on the p istol of that same flower, which is a kind of self 
fertilization, or to make sure that the pollen goes from one flower to another, which 
is basically cross-pollination. And the third thing, and this was a rea lly important 
thing, was the system was worked on before. 

And there were a number of what were called pure-breed ing lines. If he had just 
grabbed peas out of the wild it would be sort of like me starting to do genetics by 
crossing a couple of you guys. We'd get offspring, all right, and we'd cross those 
offspring, we'd keep getting things, peop le that look different and d ifferent, maybe 
something like the parents, but what had happened with peas is people had taken a 
pea, and then they continually inbred it until it finally sort of settled down. 

It always had white flowers. It a lways had wrinkled seeds. It a lways had whatever 
the particular trait was. And so, I think I showed you this slide earlier. This shows 
two things. You can see there are smooth seeds and then wrinkled seeds. And it may 
be a  little hard to tell in this light, but there is sort of two colors here. One's kind of 
greenish and one's sort of yellowish. 

So there, you see two of the traits right there. There were also flower colors, and 
height, and other things that had the characteristic. They were pure breed ing. Every 
time you took that line and if you self crossed it and put out  its progeny, you'd see 
the same characteristic each time. So, this was the system that Mendel started to 
study this prob lem of inheritance. 

And how does b lending come together when two organisms brought pollen? Or, if it 
was other anima ls like us, it would be sperm and egg. But somehow, you did 
something that ended up giving you an egg that got fertilized. And out of that came 
the progeny. So, what Mendel did, the term that's used, they say he carried out a 
cross. This is genetic-speak here now. So he took pollen from one p lant. 

And used it to fertilize another plant, collected the seeds that came out of this, and 
he examined the progeny. And I think an interesting way of thinking about this is a 
UROP project. You'd come into Mendel's lab and wanted to do a UROP project, it was 
pretty easy. I could probab ly show you all the techniques you needed to know, and 
this is it. I'd show how you pollinate, collect seeds, and then we'd look at the 
characteristics. 

So, it's just some fairly simple manipulations and some observationa l stuff. So, let's 
suppose you're doing Mendel's thing as a UROP project, and  let's just see where that 
will take us. So, what Mendel did to begin w ith, he took one of these pure breed ing 
lines that was smooth or I'll abbreviated as a capital S. And he pollinated it with 
something that was wrinkled. 

I'll do  that as little S. And then he collected the seeds from what's known as the first 
generation, starting with something like this. And geneticists use the term F1  for this 
first generation in a cross like this, and what he found was everything, all the seeds, 
were smooth. So,  the wrinkled trait had, if you will, d isappeared. That's your first 
UROP experiment. Time to submit to nature, or science, or something, and write a 
little paper like Watson and Crick that turns the world on its end. 

What would you do next? No gels, no Whitehead Sequencing Facility. Anybody got 
any ideas? I've showed you all the techniques that he knew about. Pardon? Cross it 
again? What's your thinking? Do you think the traits d isappear, or do you think  it's 
hiding? It might be hiding, right? I don't know what he thought, but I think that's a 
reasonable to think about it is he's probably trying to figure out, did this wrinkled 
tra it just d isappear from the face of the Earth, or is it hid ing in those first-generation 
seeds? So, let's put that up here. 

So, that's exactly what he did. So, he took these seeds, now, that were the smooth 
F1. These are not the same smooth as the parental up here. Just to make clear, you 
guys understand these are pure breeding. These are the ones that people have been 
breed ing for a long time, this one and this one. In this case, even though I'm 
drawing it in circles, this  is a smooth F1, smooth F1. 

And, this time when he did  the experiment he looked at the second generation, or 
the F2 generation as a geneticist would ca ll it. What he found, he got some smooth 
and he got some wrinkled. So, the wrinkled trait reemerged in the F2. So it wasn't 
really gone. It was hiding. OK, time to submit to Nature, Science or Cell. Got it? He 
didn't try and publish it at that point. 

He did something else. He had the same kind of background you guys have. Can you 
think what he might have done? He could cross again. There's something else he d id 
with this experiment, though. Well, you're thinking of new experiments. He's got a 
little data processing he can do here. What did you say? I'm not able to hear, sorry. 
Statistics, OK. I'll simplify it even slightly before that. 

I've got some of each. Count them, right, exactly. So that's what he did, and I think 
the numbers were, if I remember 5474 and 1850. So, what should I do now? Ratio? 
Absolutely. We could count another million of them, but that probab ly would not be 
terrib ly productive. And what he found out is that when he d id that, he found that he 
got a  ratio that was pretty close to 3:1. And, so that was sort of what he found out 
from this by doing this sort of thing over again was a pattern. 

A tra it disappeared in the F1. The trait reemerged in the F2, and the two tra its had 
this. The ratio of the two tra its would be about 3:1. If you don't think this is sort of 
like a UROP project or something, that's a page out of some of Mendel's actua l notes 
while he was doing his crosses. And what he d id next, then, was to take some other 
tra its. Yeah? Sorry? Excuse me? Reemerged in F2. 

So, he took some other tra its, white and purp le flowers, tall, short, I found that there 
were at least certain other traits. It didn't work for everything he studied, but some 
of them he could see the same pattern. One of the traits d isappeared. It reemerged 
in the F2, and when he counted them, he'd find that the tra it that reemerged was at 
one, and the other one there were three times as many. 

So, he'd seen a pattern. And all he's done at this point is to cross flowers and count 
the progeny. So, at that point Mendel tried to explain his data. So, he had to, now, 
take the next part of the scientific process. And what's kind of nice about thinking 
about Mendel, in this sense, is we are not overwhelmed by comp licated techniques. 
You can see, I think, the scientific process. And it's a very bare bones thing marching 
along. 

So now he's got some data. He's quantitated his stuff. He's found it reproducible. It's 
not only for seeds. It seems to be some general feature. And the thing about this, I 
guess, I don't know what he thought but it seems to be likely that he could see that 
this didn't fit very well with the blend ing idea. Like, you'd pour together two liquids, 
and you'd stir them all up. Instead, he really made this monumental leap in thinking 
that genetic information must come in some sort of particular form, come in 
particles, or units, or quanta if you want to think about if it if you're a physicist. 

We know those units as genes right now. We grow up w ith it right now, but to go 
from the  idea that genetic information was kind of like two liquids blend ing to the 
idea it was a little particle, so  it was just about the same kind of leap as thinking that 
energy comes in particles instead of a continuous sort of thing. So, that was the kind 
of insight that Mendel had. And so genetic info comes in particles, units. 

I was going to say, we now ca ll these genes, and if that was what it was then he 
started to  think about these traits as particles that had a different character 
associated with each of them. That would mean there would be one particle that was 
a big S, and that was smooth. There was some other particle that was specified. The 
wrinkled character, that would be ca lled a small s. So, what was happening in these 
crosses, then, he was now mixing particles instead of liquids. 

Again, I don't know how he got to, how many particles there had to be of each per 
organism. It could have been anywhere from two upwards. He had to have two in 
order to expla in the sort of stuff he was working with. There's no reason he couldn't 
have thought of 12 or something. But I assume you start with the very simp lest 
thing, number that you can think of, and see if you can make this work. 

So, what he hypothesized, then, was that each organism had two cop ies of each of 
these particles. So, two copies of each particle, so this would mean that there were 
two types of particles. So, there would be the S and the smooth. So, he can get 
three types of things. He could get one that was both b ig S or smooth. Or you could 
have the ones that were the two little S's. And these would be wrinkled. Or, if you 
had the other combination, what he figured out, what fit w ith this model is these 
would have to be smooth. 

That would have to mean that one of them is dominant over the other when you put 
them in combination. So, in this thing, the big S would be said to be dominant. And 
the little s Would be sa id to be recessive. There's another little term here that I'm 
going to introduce because it'll help us talk about this stuff over the next few days, 
terms geneticists use all the time. 

Because these both have two of the same, they're said to be homozygous, do the 
same. And this one, w ith one of each, is said to be heterozygous. OK, so there is, I 
think, sort of the setup for Mendel's model. He had to contend with one other issue, 
though, and that was if every organism has two, and two parents get together and 
each donate something, unless you did something, the offspring would have four. 

When those offspring got together, the next one would have tw ice as many, and so 
on. So,  from probably, I don't know whether it was just from first principles, but I 
would imagine he figured out that if organisms had sex with pollen and whatever, or 
egg and sperm, that something had to be done to get around this prob lem of an ever 
increasing number of particles. 

So, he envisioned that when there were specialized cells for sex, and that they have 
the number so that the sex cells would have half the number of particles so  that 
when each parent donated one, you'd be back up to two. It's pretty simp le, 
straightforward thinking once you've gotten the idea that these things are coming in 
a particular form. So, with this, could he now explain his results? Let's do it over 
here. 

So, what happened in the first cross? He had a smooth, pure breeding line crossed 
with, so the sex cells from this, each one would have been a big S, and the sex cells 
from each one of this would have been a little s. And as you recall, what he got was 
all smooth, right? Remember? So, if we try and figure out what's happening here, a 
way of representing this would be to think what happens if all of the comb inations 
that you could get, so if we pa ired them in all possible ways, then every comb ination 
would be identica l from that first cross, one from one parent, one from the other. 

And, if one was dominant over the other, it's going to look like this. This  is really the 
word I introduced you to. That's the genotype. That's what's going on down at the 
genetic level. What you're seeing up here is the observab le characteristics of the 
organism. That would be the phenotype. So, then what would happen then w ith this 
if he crossed the F1's? Well, as you reca ll, they were smooth, but he was now seeing 
them as being like this. 

So that means that the sex cells that are generated from this, each one w ill generate 
one big S, and one little s. And then, if you put them together to see how this would 
work out, well, this one's two big S's. This is a b ig S and a little s, a big S and a little 
s, and two little s's. So, what he's got over here  is SS, Ss, and ss in a ratio of 1:2:1. 
But when you look at the phenotype, what would we expect? Well, this would be 
smooth, b ig S and little s. 

That's smooth. Big S, little s, smooth again, and two  little s's, that's wrinkled. 
There's his ratio of 3:1. Has he proved anything? It works. Beautiful. The model 
must be right? What do you think? Are you ready to publish? Why  is that? Why d id 
the model work? Has the model pred icted anything yet? No, it works because it 
describes the data. To some extent, it's kind of like hitting a curve. 

You said it, but you don't rea lly know yet. Of course it's going to work, because if 
you got d ifferent data it would 've had a d ifferent model. So, you're putting your 
finger on a rea lly important point, and that is that you can do an experiment. You 
can get data. It doesn't have to involve DNA sequencing or fancy techniques. You're 
getting data out of a biolog ical system. 

You've come up with a hypothesis that expla ins it. But of course it's going to exp lain 
it because you wouldn't publish a model that d idn't expla in your own data. But what 
he hasn't done is tested it. Will his model pred ict the outcome of something that he 
hasn't already done? So, the suggestion was that he should carry out another cross. 
And that's what Mendel then d id aga in. 

This is what he had to work with. He could cross, and he could count, and he could 
do some calculating and some thinking. But, those were the techniques. I rea lly like 
thinking about this, because you can sort of put yourself in his shoes. So, what 
would you guys like to cross? We haven't got much, right? One, he d id. One cross he 
did, the F1 with the homozygous dominant parent, the pure breeding lines. 

So, he's got this smooth, that's a big S and a little s, and he's crossing it w ith 
something, two big S's. So, the sex cells that you'll get out of this, so if you set this 
one up and see what happens, there's the two. You will get to b ig S's, b ig S, little S, 
the b ig S, little S. This is sort of uninformative. If you want to  look at your notes 
afterwards, and have this be consistent, let me just flip this slightly. 

I put the two b ig S's up here, and this is our F1 down here. That way I'll be follow ing 
the same pattern as I did before. OK, so  there we are. In any case, they're all 
smooth, but that's not particularly help ful. He's seen that result before. It hasn't 
really proven out. G iven the sort of unexpected  result that's pred icted by his model. 
But he tried another one that's very, very similar. 

And in this case, he crossed the F1 w ith the homozygous recessive parent. This is a 
really important process in genetics. And the reason, because it's so important, it's 
given a specia l term that's called a test cross. Let's see what happens w ith this one, 
because this one's more interesting. So, we take the F1. So, this is the F1. He's now 
crossing it w ith this homozygous recessive, so a parent that's got two particles that 
are little s. 

And so, w ill the sex cells  look like this: a big S little s as before, two little S's here? 
So, if we set up this, as we've done, there are the sex cells from this F1. Here are 

the sex cells from the homozygous, recessive parent. Up here, we get a big S and a 
little s for each of those. But here, we get two little s's. So, if we look at the 
phenotype, if you're out on the field or out in the garden sitting in the kitchen, after 
you brought your seeds  in or wherever he was working, what would you pred ict 
you'd see  in a cross like this? These would be both smooth, but these would both be 
wrinkled. 

So, here at the genotypic level, we've got a ratio, now, of 1:1. And here as well, 
there's now a  ratio of 1:1. So, there you have a result that you haven't seen before. 
And, if you do that cross and get that result, again, it doesn't prove your model. 
Scientific proof is never a QED. Somebody can a lways come up with an experiment 
tomorrow  that disproves it. It tends to work more. You just keep shoveling on 
evidence, and finally someone says, enough, enough, I believe you. 

So, this was at least a test of the model, and the model survived this task. Now, he 
did one other experiment. Of the things that we've got on our plate right now, is 
there anything else we might do you can think of? He did another cross. Pardon? 
Two of the heterogeneous ones? We d id the F1's against each other. That's where we 
got the 3:1. We've already crossed the F1's, but I like your idea. 

What if we took the F2's? In this case, it's going to be pretty complicated because 
they've got this 2:1:1, but one of the things you can do w ith peas is you can self 
fertilize them as well as cross them with their neighbors because they've got the 
ability to make the eggs. It'll become the seeds, and they have the pollen, which 
would be equiva lent to the sperm. So it got both. So, as long as there's some p lants 
that you can self fertilize and some you can't, one of the rea lly nice things about 
peas, they have the property that you can self fertilize them. 

So, another kind of experiment that Mendel did, then, was to self fertilize another 
test of the model, self fertilize the F2's. Well, the model predicts, if we look back 
over there, that what you'll have there is a mix of things in a ratio of 1:2:1. So, if 
you were to take seeds from that F2, and then cross them with themselves, you 
could figure out all the different outcomes, and then sum them up. 

You'd have a prediction  for what this model would suggest. All right, so  let me just 
take you through the pieces. Let's think about a quarter of them, according to the 
model, a quarter are that. So,  if we self cross those, what we should get is a ll 
wrinkled because the only thing we're dea ling with is the wrinkled trait. So, that 
would be a quarter of the F2 seeds would be expected to give that outcome. 

So, three quarters of them are smooth, but it's tricky because there's two types of 
them in there, right? So, of these, one third are this, and two  thirds have that. So, 
what would happen if we thought about each of those individually, and thought 
about the outcome? Well, if we take the SS type, and we've self crossed them, what 
we're going to get is all smooth because all we've got in the cross are the traits for 
the smooth characteristic. 

And, if we take these guys and we've self-crossed them, we've already done that. 
We know what we will get is we w ill get smooth to wrinkled in a ratio of 3:1. So, 
again, you could now sit down with that and figure out in total what you would 
predict in terms of smooth and wrinkled if you self crossed the F2, and if the model 
is correct. So, that was basically your first UROP project, or the end of the first term, 
or the first year, or something like that. 

And he d id publish those results that were published in 1866, which was the same 
year as those, about the same time as those results that Pasteur was publishing that 
I told you about earlier on. So, it was a very impressive in retrospect, a  truly major 
intellectua l leap. But, it had almost no impact at all on the world. And there's a 
theme here that it sort of tried to hit up several times. 

And we saw it,  to some extent, with the early work on DNA, that someone can get 
evidence for an idea. But if the scientific community is ready to accept it, it can take 
quite awhile before that idea becomes credib le even if it's correct. The data was 
there. The DNA was genetic material quite a bit before the general scientists thought 
it was, and  it just seemed like it was too simple a molecule, too boring a molecule to 
be possibly ab le to encode anything. 

And the same sort of thing happened here. It was some geneticists picked up on this 
but not until about 1900.
