1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:03
Julia just mentioned that a few
of you had commented,

2
00:00:03 --> 00:00:07
when we were talking about the
genetic code, that some of you

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:11
thought the fact that it was
degenerate, it had some redundancy

4
00:00:11 --> 00:00:15
in it, like multiple codons or
threonine, that that was kind of

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:19
cool, and some of you thought it was
sort of a waste and would have maybe

6
00:00:19 --> 00:00:23
designed the thing differently.
That's, you know, part of when you

7
00:00:23 --> 00:00:27
study biology you don't get to
design it from first principles.

8
00:00:27 --> 00:00:31
You found out what happened during
evolution and what got selected for.

9
00:00:31 --> 00:00:36
And once it gets selected for then
that gets sort of fixed in nature.

10
00:00:36 --> 00:00:40
If there were four nucleotides then
you could have one,

11
00:00:40 --> 00:00:45
two and three-letter words.
And it's going to be a three-letter

12
00:00:45 --> 00:00:49
word to have at least 20 then you've
got some degeneracy or redundancy,

13
00:00:49 --> 00:00:54
but that's not necessarily a bad
thing.  And, in fact,

14
00:00:54 --> 00:00:58
if you go into the evolution of the
code more deeply,

15
00:00:58 --> 00:01:03
people are beginning to suspect it
evolved from a simpler one.

16
00:01:03 --> 00:01:07
And there actually are some
relationships between some of the

17
00:01:07 --> 00:01:11
codons that go back to the
similarities, the chemical

18
00:01:11 --> 00:01:15
similarities between the amino acids.
And it also allows some things for

19
00:01:15 --> 00:01:19
some cells, for example,
if they want proteins to be present

20
00:01:19 --> 00:01:23
at very low levels they will use a
codon that has just a very low level

21
00:01:23 --> 00:01:27
of the corresponding tRNA.
And if they want to make a lot of

22
00:01:27 --> 00:01:32
the protein they'll use a tRNA that
it makes in abundance.

23
00:01:32 --> 00:01:35
And so it's sort of another way of
controlling levels of proteins.

24
00:01:35 --> 00:01:38
There are a lot of different
subtleties in here.

25
00:01:38 --> 00:01:41
And also in biology redundancy is
not necessarily a bad thing.

26
00:01:41 --> 00:01:44
It's just like on a space flight,
if something goes wrong and if

27
00:01:44 --> 00:01:48
there's some kind of redundant
function then you've got some

28
00:01:48 --> 00:01:51
backups, too.  OK.
Well, in any case,

29
00:01:51 --> 00:01:54
today is a pretty interesting first
part of the lecture.

30
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
I've heard a few people express the
view that why can't I just teach

31
00:01:57 --> 00:02:01
what's in the textbook
and get on with it?

32
00:02:01 --> 00:02:06
And I think this part,
for those of you who are following,

33
00:02:06 --> 00:02:11
really trying to understand what I'm
trying to do with this course,

34
00:02:11 --> 00:02:17
I hope this will help you to see
this.  Because what I've talked

35
00:02:17 --> 00:02:22
about, this thing that Crick called
the "central dogma" which was the

36
00:02:22 --> 00:02:28
direction of information flow in
biology which was from DNA

37
00:02:28 --> 00:02:33
to RNA to proteins.
And I'll just remind you,

38
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
although proteins do many things
they are, for example,

39
00:02:37 --> 00:02:42
enzymes that are biological
catalysts.  And it was pretty

40
00:02:42 --> 00:02:46
well-established,
even by the time I was an undergrad

41
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
that this was the way information
flow went in biology and this was

42
00:02:50 --> 00:02:55
how it worked.
And there were various statements

43
00:02:55 --> 00:02:59
in the literature that what was true
for E. coli was true

44
00:02:59 --> 00:03:03
for an elephant.
And it is still true today in a

45
00:03:03 --> 00:03:07
broad sense that,
as I've tried to emphasize

46
00:03:07 --> 00:03:11
throughout the course,
when you get down to a cellular

47
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
molecule level there's an awful lot
in common and things look much more

48
00:03:14 --> 00:03:18
alike than different compared to
what we see at a more macroscopic

49
00:03:18 --> 00:03:21
scale.  However,
that doesn't mean that all the

50
00:03:21 --> 00:03:25
details are the same.
And maybe you could begin to get a

51
00:03:25 --> 00:03:29
glimmering of that when I told you
that although the genetic code is

52
00:03:29 --> 00:03:33
virtually universal.
That almost every organism,

53
00:03:33 --> 00:03:37
with only a couple very tiny
exceptions, uses exactly the same

54
00:03:37 --> 00:03:41
genetic code to have nucleotides
correspond to three-letter words in

55
00:03:41 --> 00:03:45
the nucleic acid alphabet correspond
to particular amino acids in a

56
00:03:45 --> 00:03:49
protein.  But the other languages
that are written in there such as

57
00:03:49 --> 00:03:53
the sequence to start transcribing a
gene, making an RNA copy are stopped.

58
00:03:53 --> 00:03:58
Those are different between
different organisms.  Yeah?

59
00:03:58 --> 00:04:05
Glycolysis enzymes are amazingly

60
00:04:05 --> 00:04:09
similar.  They are very clearly,
they arose once, and they have

61
00:04:09 --> 00:04:12
stayed right through evolution.
You could, in principle, sometimes

62
00:04:12 --> 00:04:16
in evolution you get something that
creates a function and something

63
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
that starts out,
and then like what they call

64
00:04:19 --> 00:04:23
convergent evolution you end up with
two things that came from a

65
00:04:23 --> 00:04:26
different evolutionary origin but
have learned to do,

66
00:04:26 --> 00:04:30
let's say, catalyze the same
biochemical reaction or something.

67
00:04:30 --> 00:04:34
Glycolysis came once.
But if you were to look inside E.

68
00:04:34 --> 00:04:38
coli or yeast, let's say E. coli and
look at how those enzymes are

69
00:04:38 --> 00:04:43
regulated, the thing that says this
is the start of a gene,

70
00:04:43 --> 00:04:47
start making the RNA, it would look
totally different than if you looked

71
00:04:47 --> 00:04:52
in a mouse because the language,
the promoter does not have the same

72
00:04:52 --> 00:04:56
sequence in an E.
coli and in a human or in a mouse.

73
00:04:56 --> 00:05:01
And I'll tell you more about that
today.  But there were --

74
00:05:01 --> 00:05:05
I want to just now tell you sort of
three things that were sort of

75
00:05:05 --> 00:05:09
exceptions to this general way of
thinking.  Every one of them

76
00:05:09 --> 00:05:13
generated a Nobel Prize.
And this is a fun lecture for me to

77
00:05:13 --> 00:05:17
give because the individuals
involved in all of these things had

78
00:05:17 --> 00:05:21
a very, very close association with
MIT.  And when I told you when Crick

79
00:05:21 --> 00:05:25
called this a central dogma he meant
a hypothesis, or at least an idea

80
00:05:25 --> 00:05:30
for which there was not
reasonable evidence.

81
00:05:30 --> 00:05:35
And he learned later it was
something a true believer cannot

82
00:05:35 --> 00:05:40
doubt.  And once this gets
established it does get in the

83
00:05:40 --> 00:05:45
textbook and it does get in your
thinking.  And so information goes

84
00:05:45 --> 00:05:50
down this way.
But there were a few oddities.

85
00:05:50 --> 00:05:55
I mean there were some viruses that
had RNA inside them.

86
00:05:55 --> 00:06:00
They didn't have DNA.
So how where these handled?

87
00:06:00 --> 00:06:06
Well, there turned out to be two
classes of RNA virus.

88
00:06:06 --> 00:06:12
One that was studied quite heavily
called, it's a plant virus called

89
00:06:12 --> 00:06:18
the tobacco mosaic virus.
And it had a coat.  And then it had

90
00:06:18 --> 00:06:24
in it a piece of RNA.
Now, you can see if that virus were

91
00:06:24 --> 00:06:31
to inject RNA in the cell it could
encode proteins.

92
00:06:31 --> 00:06:39
But that genetic material has to be
copied.  And the RNA was copied --

93
00:06:39 --> 00:06:55
-- by an RNA dependent

94
00:06:55 --> 00:07:04
RNA polymerase.
And so it's sort of just like the

95
00:07:04 --> 00:07:09
RNA polymerase before,
except instead of using DNA as its

96
00:07:09 --> 00:07:14
template it can use RNA.
So that sort of somehow would be a

97
00:07:14 --> 00:07:19
little loop in here about RNA being
able to copy itself that hadn't been

98
00:07:19 --> 00:07:24
anticipated.  And although this is
an important virus in the plant

99
00:07:24 --> 00:07:29
industry, for plants and agriculture,
it's not so important for humans.

100
00:07:29 --> 00:07:37
But there's another class of RNA
viruses that are very important.

101
00:07:37 --> 00:07:46
And these are called retroviruses.
And the reason these are so

102
00:07:46 --> 00:07:55
important is that the HIV-1 virus
that's associated with AIDS is such

103
00:07:55 --> 00:08:04
a retrovirus.  It's a virus that has
a coat and it has an RNA that's it

104
00:08:04 --> 00:08:11
genetic material.
And the person who worked out how

105
00:08:11 --> 00:08:15
this goes was a person at MIT,
Dave Baltimore.  He was a colleague

106
00:08:15 --> 00:08:19
of mine here for many years.
He was the person who founded the

107
00:08:19 --> 00:08:23
White Head Institute and got that up
and going.  And he then finally,

108
00:08:23 --> 00:08:27
to move up one more administrative
challenge, went to Caltech

109
00:08:27 --> 00:08:32
to be president.
And that's where he is today.

110
00:08:32 --> 00:08:36
And David was working on this
problem trying to figure out how

111
00:08:36 --> 00:08:41
these retroviruses work.
And they're important.  Not only

112
00:08:41 --> 00:08:45
the HIV-1 virus,
but there are certain viruses that

113
00:08:45 --> 00:08:50
are associated with cancer.
In general, what they do is they've

114
00:08:50 --> 00:08:54
picked up what's called an oncogene
which is sort of often a mutated

115
00:08:54 --> 00:08:59
version of one of your
normal genes.

116
00:08:59 --> 00:09:03
And if that virus gets inside one of
your cells and brings in this

117
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
mutated gene it's sort of kind of
the same consequence as mutating one

118
00:09:07 --> 00:09:12
of your own genes along that
progression of cancer.

119
00:09:12 --> 00:09:16
So it can kind of, say,
bring in a cell that screws up the

120
00:09:16 --> 00:09:21
control on when cells are supposed
to replicate and stop dividing and

121
00:09:21 --> 00:09:25
so on.  So David started to work on
these, and what he discovered was

122
00:09:25 --> 00:09:29
that these viruses encoded,
they had information encoding

123
00:09:29 --> 00:09:35
proteins.
And one of the proteins encoded in

124
00:09:35 --> 00:09:42
their RNA is an enzyme
de-characterized which is given the

125
00:09:42 --> 00:09:48
name "reverse transcriptase".
And what this can do is take an RNA

126
00:09:48 --> 00:09:55
template and make the corresponding
complimentary DNA strand in this way.

127
00:09:55 --> 00:10:02
So that if we took the --
We'll just take this RNA out of the

128
00:10:02 --> 00:10:08
virus.  What this virus encodes then
is an enzyme that's able to take

129
00:10:08 --> 00:10:14
this RNA and make the corresponding
DNA copy.  So there's the original

130
00:10:14 --> 00:10:21
RNA that was in the virus.
There is the RNA that it started

131
00:10:21 --> 00:10:27
out.  And so what is happening,
if you will in that case, is the

132
00:10:27 --> 00:10:34
information is flowing in
the other direction.

133
00:10:34 --> 00:10:44
That was a marvelous discovery.

134
00:10:44 --> 00:10:48
And it was discovered by someone
who wasn't willing just to take what

135
00:10:48 --> 00:10:52
was in the textbooks but was trying
to figure out what could possibly be

136
00:10:52 --> 00:10:56
going on here.
Now, the way these viruses work

137
00:10:56 --> 00:11:00
then, once they've done this it's
not so bad because they've got their

138
00:11:00 --> 00:11:06
information now in the form of DNA.
So this strand of DNA can be made

139
00:11:06 --> 00:11:13
into a double-stranded DNA by just
using the kinds of enzymes that

140
00:11:13 --> 00:11:19
we've already talked about.
A DNA dependent DNA polymerase will

141
00:11:19 --> 00:11:26
be able to copy the other thing.
And now you've got a DNA copy of

142
00:11:26 --> 00:11:33
the information that used to be in
the virus.  But what happens to that

143
00:11:33 --> 00:11:40
is that you have a piece
of the host DNA.

144
00:11:40 --> 00:11:48
And this viral DNA then inserts into
it, so you end up with this

145
00:11:48 --> 00:11:56
situation where you have DNA from
the host, and this

146
00:11:56 --> 00:12:04
is the virus DNA.
So this is the DNA that encodes the

147
00:12:04 --> 00:12:10
information needed for the virus.
And if this was our DNA then it

148
00:12:10 --> 00:12:17
would be inserted that way.
And there are just a handful of

149
00:12:17 --> 00:12:23
health messages I've tried to drive
home in this thing.

150
00:12:23 --> 00:12:30
I mentioned smoking the other day.
If you smoke --

151
00:12:30 --> 00:12:34
If you stop smoking you basically,
well, let me try another way.  The

152
00:12:34 --> 00:12:38
risk of smoking is about equal to
the sum of everything else you can

153
00:12:38 --> 00:12:42
possibly do in your life that will
affect your chances of getting

154
00:12:42 --> 00:12:47
cancer, leaving aside what you
inherited from mom and dad.

155
00:12:47 --> 00:12:51
The one single thing to not do if
you want to avoid cancer,

156
00:12:51 --> 00:12:55
or to help loved ones who smoke
avoid cancer, is just don't smoke,

157
00:12:55 --> 00:13:00
or if you do smoke, stop.
You freeze the risk of whatever

158
00:13:00 --> 00:13:06
increased risk you've got,
and then just live with that,

159
00:13:06 --> 00:13:11
but it doesn't keep getting worse
with time.  The other one is

160
00:13:11 --> 00:13:17
practice safe sex,
and this is why.  HIV-1 is a

161
00:13:17 --> 00:13:22
retrovirus.  If you get infected
with it, it makes a DNA copy of the

162
00:13:22 --> 00:13:28
RNA, it makes the other strand of
the DNA, and it sticks itself in.

163
00:13:28 --> 00:13:34
So what you've got is your DNA here,
your DNA there.

164
00:13:34 --> 00:13:39
And HIV-1 is a permanent traveling
companion for the rest of your life.

165
00:13:39 --> 00:13:44
There's no way of getting that out
of there right now.

166
00:13:44 --> 00:13:49
All the systems for dealing with
AIDS are just managing the infection.

167
00:13:49 --> 00:13:54
So when someone is HIV-1 positive,
they've got those viral genes now

168
00:13:54 --> 00:14:00
permanently integrated
into their DNA.

169
00:14:00 --> 00:14:04
So it's extremely important that you
be aware of that,

170
00:14:04 --> 00:14:08
or if you know people who don't
appreciate this because they haven't

171
00:14:08 --> 00:14:12
got so much of a biology background
that you help them understand that.

172
00:14:12 --> 00:14:16
OK.  So I just wanted to show you,
I found one other picture last night.

173
00:14:16 --> 00:14:20
And this is you see all these old
scientists, right?

174
00:14:20 --> 00:14:24
Of course, David didn't look like
this when he was doing his work.

175
00:14:24 --> 00:14:28
In fact, I think he's fairly
cleaned up here.

176
00:14:28 --> 00:14:32
I found this one in the Cold Spring
Harbor archives last night.

177
00:14:32 --> 00:14:35
I've seen pictures of him looking
considerably more shaggy and perhaps

178
00:14:35 --> 00:14:38
disreputable and stuff.
But anyway, when David was making

179
00:14:38 --> 00:14:42
all these discoveries he was still
quite a young man.

180
00:14:42 --> 00:14:45
I believe he got his Nobel Prize
when he was still in his thirties.

181
00:14:45 --> 00:14:49
And so many of these discoveries
are made by people that are not all

182
00:14:49 --> 00:14:52
that much older than you.
But, again, it's trying to

183
00:14:52 --> 00:14:56
understand why we know what we know
and then trying to fit

184
00:14:56 --> 00:15:01
other things into it.
Now, the next thing I want to tell

185
00:15:01 --> 00:15:09
you about that has some of this same
character, I've sort of told you

186
00:15:09 --> 00:15:16
that you have a piece of DNA.
Let's say there's a gene here and

187
00:15:16 --> 00:15:24
this is the coding region,
and then we make a mRNA copy,

188
00:15:24 --> 00:15:32
and then we use the genetic code and
we make the protein.

189
00:15:32 --> 00:15:37
And so if we sequence the DNA and
find the beginning of this protein

190
00:15:37 --> 00:15:42
we can read along using that genetic
code and away it should go.

191
00:15:42 --> 00:15:47
And that was beautifully worked out,
understood, just like I sort of

192
00:15:47 --> 00:15:52
finished up telling you the other
day.  So Phil Sharp who got a Nobel

193
00:15:52 --> 00:15:57
Prize for this work and his
colleague in the Biology

194
00:15:57 --> 00:16:02
Department.
He's in the Cancer Center just

195
00:16:02 --> 00:16:06
across the street from the building
I'm in.  That was the cancer center

196
00:16:06 --> 00:16:11
that Salvador Laurier,
who Jim Watson trained with,

197
00:16:11 --> 00:16:16
had founded.  And Phil was studying
this process.  It was before we

198
00:16:16 --> 00:16:20
could sequence DNA.
It was in the mid '70s.

199
00:16:20 --> 00:16:25
And he was working with the tools
we had then trying to map the

200
00:16:25 --> 00:16:30
relationship of an RNA to a gene
that was on a virus.

201
00:16:30 --> 00:16:35
It was a DNA virus,
not an RNA virus, so don't get

202
00:16:35 --> 00:16:40
yourself mixed up with that.
But what he had was basically a

203
00:16:40 --> 00:16:46
fragment of DNA that he knew encoded
the gene.  So he knew somewhere on

204
00:16:46 --> 00:16:51
this piece of DNA there was a gene
somewhere in here,

205
00:16:51 --> 00:16:57
and he had isolated the mRNA.
And one way you could map,

206
00:16:57 --> 00:17:02
physically see the relationship of
an RNA and a DNA would be to take,

207
00:17:02 --> 00:17:08
let's just take away one of these
strands.

208
00:17:08 --> 00:17:13
So we have the complimentary strand
of the DNA to the RNA.

209
00:17:13 --> 00:17:19
And if we mix them together and let
them slowly cool down they will form

210
00:17:19 --> 00:17:24
hydrogen bonds.
They'll form a DNA-RNA hybrid just

211
00:17:24 --> 00:17:30
the same way two strands of DNA come
on.  And so if the gene was a little

212
00:17:30 --> 00:17:36
shorter than the piece of DNA then
you might have expected to see

213
00:17:36 --> 00:17:41
something that looked like this.
And the way you'd see this,

214
00:17:41 --> 00:17:45
if you looked in an electron
microscope --

215
00:17:45 --> 00:17:52
-- perhaps it would look sort of

216
00:17:52 --> 00:17:56
like this.  You cannot actually see
the two strands,

217
00:17:56 --> 00:18:00
but you'd see a thick part.
That would be the RNA duplex.

218
00:18:00 --> 00:18:06
So this would be just DNA.
And the thick part is RNA base

219
00:18:06 --> 00:18:12
paired with a single strand of DNA.
You got it?  That's what textbooks

220
00:18:12 --> 00:18:18
said you should have seen.
And so this is more.  This is data

221
00:18:18 --> 00:18:24
from Phil's paper describing this.
And let me focus on this one in

222
00:18:24 --> 00:18:31
particular.  That's what
he actually saw.

223
00:18:31 --> 00:18:38
You guys got any idea what's going

224
00:18:38 --> 00:18:43
on?  Why don't you take a minute,
find somebody who's near you and see

225
00:18:43 --> 00:18:48
if you can come up with any ideas.
Here's the hybrid.  Forget about

226
00:18:48 --> 00:18:54
this little bit at the 3 prime end.
That's not a worry.  Here is the

227
00:18:54 --> 00:18:59
thing.  And this,
I think, is a piece of single

228
00:18:59 --> 00:19:05
stranded DNA sticking out the end.
But it looks a bit more complicated.

229
00:19:05 --> 00:19:11
Any ideas?  Most people put this
data in their drawers.

230
00:19:11 --> 00:19:17
Phil didn't.  Phil and his
colleagues didn't.

231
00:19:17 --> 00:19:23
What they realized was,
I'm going to try and redraw this

232
00:19:23 --> 00:19:30
just very slightly to help you see
what's going on.

233
00:19:30 --> 00:19:35
What they were seeing was something
that looked rather like what they

234
00:19:35 --> 00:19:40
were expecting.
They were seeing a region of hybrid

235
00:19:40 --> 00:19:45
DNA and they were seeing a region of
single-stranded DNA like this,

236
00:19:45 --> 00:19:50
but what it looked like was there
were little loops of single-stranded

237
00:19:50 --> 00:19:55
DNA sticking out.
And what Phil had discovered was a

238
00:19:55 --> 00:20:01
phenomenon we now know
as RNA splicing.

239
00:20:01 --> 00:20:08
And here's what goes on.

240
00:20:08 --> 00:20:12
In bacteria, with very few
exceptions, you can look at the DNA,

241
00:20:12 --> 00:20:16
you can find the open reading frame
and you can just read off the

242
00:20:16 --> 00:20:20
sequence of the protein.
You find the ATG, AUG, methionine

243
00:20:20 --> 00:20:24
codon, and then it keeps going no
stops, and finally you come to a

244
00:20:24 --> 00:20:28
stop codon and you see there is the
protein.  So the coding information

245
00:20:28 --> 00:20:33
is essentially continuous in almost
all bacterial genes.

246
00:20:33 --> 00:20:37
And there's a few,
some genes like that in eukaryotes,

247
00:20:37 --> 00:20:41
but many eukaryotic genes are
constructed, it's almost as if you

248
00:20:41 --> 00:20:45
took the gene you'd find in a
bacterium and then you'd cut it in a

249
00:20:45 --> 00:20:50
bunch of places and stuck extra DNA
in between all of the pieces.

250
00:20:50 --> 00:20:54
So you'd get something like this
where there's,

251
00:20:54 --> 00:20:59
in the DNA there'd be coding
information.

252
00:20:59 --> 00:21:07
And then non-coding information and
another block of coding information.

253
00:21:07 --> 00:21:16
And then a block of non-coding and
say another one of coding

254
00:21:16 --> 00:21:24
information.  So this is a
double-stranded DNA.

255
00:21:24 --> 00:21:33
And what happens then when the cell
makes RNA is the whole thing gets

256
00:21:33 --> 00:21:42
copied into what's known now as a
pre-messenger RNA.

257
00:21:42 --> 00:21:47
And so there's a bit of coding stuff
here, there's a bit of coding stuff

258
00:21:47 --> 00:21:52
here, and there's some more coding
stuff there.  But what the cell has

259
00:21:52 --> 00:21:57
is sort of like your unedited
footage from your family summer

260
00:21:57 --> 00:22:03
vacating when you were running
the video camera.

261
00:22:03 --> 00:22:07
And maybe you don't want to show
everybody ever second of video that

262
00:22:07 --> 00:22:11
you took during the thing.
So what you do, you get in there

263
00:22:11 --> 00:22:16
and you edit it.
In the old days you used to have to

264
00:22:16 --> 00:22:20
take the film and splice it.
And now you can all do it with

265
00:22:20 --> 00:22:25
iMovie or something like that.
But what you do is take the pieces

266
00:22:25 --> 00:22:29
of information you want,
and this is what the cell is doing.

267
00:22:29 --> 00:22:36
It takes this part of the RNA.
And this part of the RNA,

268
00:22:36 --> 00:22:45
and joins it together, and then this
part.  And when it's done it has the

269
00:22:45 --> 00:22:54
mRNA that now looks like the kind of
mRNA that you would find in a

270
00:22:54 --> 00:23:03
bacterium where you can
find the start codon.

271
00:23:03 --> 00:23:09
And then you could read in
three-letter words all the way

272
00:23:09 --> 00:23:15
through to the end of the protein.
So, in essence, what Phil found was

273
00:23:15 --> 00:23:21
that in many organisms at least
there's another step in here where

274
00:23:21 --> 00:23:27
we get RNA splicing.
And only after that you get down to

275
00:23:27 --> 00:23:33
proteins.
What was quite remarkable about this

276
00:23:33 --> 00:23:37
result and why I'm kind of hammering
on it a little bit is this is the

277
00:23:37 --> 00:23:41
data that's out of Phil's paper.
You can look it up on the Internet.

278
00:23:41 --> 00:23:45
Type in Phil Sharp 1977 and you'll
find this original paper with that

279
00:23:45 --> 00:23:49
figure in it.  The moment Phil
realized what he was and talked

280
00:23:49 --> 00:23:53
about it at a meeting,
a whole lot of people suddenly sort

281
00:23:53 --> 00:23:57
of almost simultaneously discovered
RNA splicing because they opened

282
00:23:57 --> 00:24:01
their drawers and there were all
these uninterpretable electron

283
00:24:01 --> 00:24:06
micrographs they had.
And they were in very short order

284
00:24:06 --> 00:24:10
able to save it in the system.
The same thing was going on, but it

285
00:24:10 --> 00:24:14
was just confusing,
it didn't fit, and to some extent

286
00:24:14 --> 00:24:18
most people's minds were set by this
paradigm, this central dogma as

287
00:24:18 --> 00:24:22
something that a true believer
cannot doubt.  And you had to have a

288
00:24:22 --> 00:24:27
flexible enough mind to
be able to see that.

289
00:24:27 --> 00:24:33
And so this is an important piece of
biology that hadn't been anticipated.

290
00:24:33 --> 00:24:39
And it can be quite remarkable.
I'm just going to give you a couple

291
00:24:39 --> 00:24:45
of extreme examples.
Well, not even extreme examples.

292
00:24:45 --> 00:24:51
But just show you how much
non-coding information there can be.

293
00:24:51 --> 00:24:57
Factor 8 is a protein that plays a
part in blood clotting.

294
00:24:57 --> 00:25:03
And the gene is 200 kilobase pairs.
And the pre-mRNA is just a direct

295
00:25:03 --> 00:25:11
copy, so it's 200 kilobases.
It's just a single strand so it's

296
00:25:11 --> 00:25:19
not a base pair.
And the actually spliced mRNA when

297
00:25:19 --> 00:25:27
it's done is 10 kilobases.
So that means that only 5% of the

298
00:25:27 --> 00:25:35
gene is coding information and 95%
of that information gets thrown away

299
00:25:35 --> 00:25:42
when the RNA gets spliced.
And even a more extreme example is a

300
00:25:42 --> 00:25:48
protein called dystrophin.
This is what's affected in a human

301
00:25:48 --> 00:25:55
genetic disease known as Duchenne
muscular dystrophy.

302
00:25:55 --> 00:26:06
In this case, the gene is two mega

303
00:26:06 --> 00:26:17
base pairs.  So of course then the
pre-mRNA is also two mega bases but

304
00:26:17 --> 00:26:28
the pre-RNA is 16 kilobases.
So in this case less than 1% of the

305
00:26:28 --> 00:26:40
gene has coding information
for making a protein.

306
00:26:40 --> 00:26:44
There are a lot of interesting
reasons as to why it would be like

307
00:26:44 --> 00:26:49
this.  One this,
things can evolve more rapidly

308
00:26:49 --> 00:26:54
sometimes because you have parts of
proteins that are sort of like

309
00:26:54 --> 00:26:59
modules and evolution can
probably connect them.

310
00:26:59 --> 00:27:03
I fact, it also provides ways of
regulating because we now know there

311
00:27:03 --> 00:27:08
are alternative ways of splicing RNA.
So you can take one RNA and then

312
00:27:08 --> 00:27:12
splice it in different ways in
different cells and end up

313
00:27:12 --> 00:27:17
generating different proteins that
were all encoded by one particular

314
00:27:17 --> 00:27:21
gene.  And so it gives cells
different kinds of regulatory

315
00:27:21 --> 00:27:26
strategies they can use.
Now, the third sort of thing that

316
00:27:26 --> 00:27:31
came out that falls in this same
kind of thing of people having their

317
00:27:31 --> 00:27:36
minds open and not fixed by the
current understanding or bounded by

318
00:27:36 --> 00:27:41
the current understanding is the
discovery that RNA can act as an

319
00:27:41 --> 00:27:46
enzyme.  And I've already talked to
you about that and I've told it was

320
00:27:46 --> 00:27:51
ribozyme, but it was discovered by
Tom Cech.  Tom is currently

321
00:27:51 --> 00:27:56
president of the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute,

322
00:27:56 --> 00:28:02
but he did his post-doctoral work at
MIT with Mary Lou Pardue.

323
00:28:02 --> 00:28:05
I've been a post-doc at Berkeley
when he was just finishing his

324
00:28:05 --> 00:28:09
graduate work,
and I met him out there.

325
00:28:09 --> 00:28:13
And then he came to MIT to do his
post-doc.  And a year later I got a

326
00:28:13 --> 00:28:17
job so I'd become friends there and
became friends when we started here.

327
00:28:17 --> 00:28:21
So I had a pretty close link to
this particular story.

328
00:28:21 --> 00:28:25
Here's a picture of Tom together
with Phil.  That's actually my wife

329
00:28:25 --> 00:28:29
right there who was in this picture.
But Tom actually looks much more

330
00:28:29 --> 00:28:35
like that.
He's very colorful,

331
00:28:35 --> 00:28:43
very fun, a very interesting person.
But anyway, when Tom left MIT to

332
00:28:43 --> 00:28:51
take a faculty position at Bolder he
was interested in trying to

333
00:28:51 --> 00:29:00
understand the biochemistry of RNA
splicing.  And so he went --

334
00:29:00 --> 00:29:03
He did what a good scientist will do.
They'll try and find an

335
00:29:03 --> 00:29:07
experimental system where the
question they want to address is

336
00:29:07 --> 00:29:10
simple enough you can actually get
an answer.  There's a kind of way of

337
00:29:10 --> 00:29:14
doing science where you pick a
system that's too complicated and

338
00:29:14 --> 00:29:17
you never actually get an answer.
It sounds very important because

339
00:29:17 --> 00:29:21
you're working on something that's
important but you cannot,

340
00:29:21 --> 00:29:24
you don't have the tools you need to
get to the answer.

341
00:29:24 --> 00:29:28
So Tom wanted to work on the
biochemistry of RNA splicing because

342
00:29:28 --> 00:29:32
that had just been discovered.
And so he went to a small little

343
00:29:32 --> 00:29:37
tiny organism called tetrahymena.
And the reason he looked at that

344
00:29:37 --> 00:29:41
was because it had a ribosomal RNA,
so it was an RNA that was made in

345
00:29:41 --> 00:29:46
great abundance within the organism.
And it only had one of these

346
00:29:46 --> 00:29:51
non-coding regions.
I'll tell you the words for these

347
00:29:51 --> 00:29:56
coding and non-coding.
To me they're non-intuitive,

348
00:29:56 --> 00:30:01
but I guess you should know them.

349
00:30:01 --> 00:30:10
The coding region is called,
the part that codes is called an

350
00:30:10 --> 00:30:19
exon and the non-coding part is
called an intron.

351
00:30:19 --> 00:30:29
So, anyway, Tom worked on this
organism because the pre-mRNA

352
00:30:29 --> 00:30:37
was basically this.
Or the pre-RNA before the splicing

353
00:30:37 --> 00:30:45
looked like this.
This was going to give this like

354
00:30:45 --> 00:30:52
that.  He could get large quantities
of this RNA, so he was all set to

355
00:30:52 --> 00:31:00
make extracts of the cells of this
organism and then start cooking up

356
00:31:00 --> 00:31:08
this RNA substrate with all sorts of
cell extracts.

357
00:31:08 --> 00:31:00
And then his plan was to purify the
enzymes that did the RNA splicing.

358
00:31:00 --> 00:30:52
And so I first heard about this,
Tom was working on this when he was

359
00:30:52 --> 00:30:44
here.  And he went off to,
I guess it was Denmark to learn how

360
00:30:44 --> 00:30:36
to grow this organism.
Then they were back and he was off

361
00:30:36 --> 00:30:29
at Bolder.  And we used to play
squash all the time.

362
00:30:29 --> 00:30:40
And whenever I got out to Bolder
we'd try and get in a squash game.

363
00:30:40 --> 00:30:51
So I was out there at a meeting and
we were sitting around in the locker

364
00:30:51 --> 00:31:03
room.  And I said so how's the
splicing biochemistry projecting

365
00:31:03 --> 00:31:14
going?  Tom says,
well, it's going OK,

366
00:31:14 --> 00:31:25
I guess.  There's only one little
problem, he says.

367
00:31:25 --> 00:31:37
The controls are splicing.
Now, what he meant was if you were

368
00:31:37 --> 00:31:48
trying to add cell extract and get
this thing to go what you would

369
00:31:48 --> 00:32:00
start out with is the RNA
in a tube basically.

370
00:32:00 --> 00:32:04
And that would be your control.
And then you'd start adding stuff

371
00:32:04 --> 00:32:08
to it and start looking for splicing.
And what Tom was finding was that

372
00:32:08 --> 00:32:12
if you just took this RNA and let it
sit in a test tube that the splicing

373
00:32:12 --> 00:32:17
happened without him putting
anything in.  And here he was

374
00:32:17 --> 00:32:21
already to find all the enzymes,
the proteins that did it.  And Tom

375
00:32:21 --> 00:32:25
did an absolutely gorgeous piece of
science to prove that what was

376
00:32:25 --> 00:32:30
happening was the RNA was catalyzing
its own splicing.

377
00:32:30 --> 00:32:33
And he had to work very,
very hard to prove that it wasn't a

378
00:32:33 --> 00:32:37
contaminating protein.
Remember we had this sort of

379
00:32:37 --> 00:32:41
discussion?  We were talking about
is DNA the genetic material and how

380
00:32:41 --> 00:32:45
would we know that it wasn't just a
little tiny bit of something else in

381
00:32:45 --> 00:32:49
our DNA perhaps that was doing it.
Tom had to go through pretty much a

382
00:32:49 --> 00:32:53
similar exercise,
but this was one of these key

383
00:32:53 --> 00:32:57
insights that lead to the proof that
RNA could function as a catalyst,

384
00:32:57 --> 00:33:02
what we now know as a ribozyme.
And I've shown you now we now sort

385
00:33:02 --> 00:33:08
of accept that the actual ribosome
itself is a ribozyme and that the

386
00:33:08 --> 00:33:15
formation of the peptide bond,
the thing that's the heart of all

387
00:33:15 --> 00:33:22
proteins is made by a ribozyme,
not catalyzed by ribosomes and not

388
00:33:22 --> 00:33:28
by a protein.  OK.
So the next topic that I want to

389
00:33:28 --> 00:33:35
try on which sort of we've already
set up from this is that if the

390
00:33:35 --> 00:33:42
information is all in DNA to begin
with then if you make an RNA copy

391
00:33:42 --> 00:33:49
you're only taking a segment of that
information at a time.

392
00:33:49 --> 00:33:55
And that gives the cells a lot of
possibilities for regulating how

393
00:33:55 --> 00:34:01
they respond to the environment or
just controlling what genes are

394
00:34:01 --> 00:34:07
expressed.  And there are basically
two kinds of strategies that are

395
00:34:07 --> 00:34:14
involved in these regulatory
decisions.  They can either be --

396
00:34:14 --> 00:34:29
Can either be reversible changes.

397
00:34:29 --> 00:34:33
For example, a bacterium and a food
source.  If you're a bacterium and

398
00:34:33 --> 00:34:38
you've got enzymes that let you eat
a hundred different kinds of food

399
00:34:38 --> 00:34:42
and you're in an environment where
there's only one of them there,

400
00:34:42 --> 00:34:47
you're really wasting energy if you
make the proteins to make the other

401
00:34:47 --> 00:34:52
99.  So you might guess that somehow
evolution has selected four systems

402
00:34:52 --> 00:34:56
that have learned how to turn on and
off the things they need to eat

403
00:34:56 --> 00:35:01
certain food sources depending on
whether the food source

404
00:35:01 --> 00:35:06
is available.
We only carry umbrellas when it

405
00:35:06 --> 00:35:10
rains.  If you had to carry an
umbrella and a snowsuit and a

406
00:35:10 --> 00:35:14
surfboard, everything all the time,
it would slow you down in evolution.

407
00:35:14 --> 00:35:18
So the other type, which we've
talked about as well when we talked

408
00:35:18 --> 00:35:22
about starting as a single cell and
going up to the 14 cells that make

409
00:35:22 --> 00:35:26
us up, then many of those changes,
as those cells go along and

410
00:35:26 --> 00:35:31
progressively more specialized need
to be irreversible.

411
00:35:31 --> 00:35:36
And this is particularly important

412
00:35:36 --> 00:35:40
in development.
We don't want a cell in our retina

413
00:35:40 --> 00:35:44
suddenly deciding it should be part
of a heart and start to make a heart

414
00:35:44 --> 00:35:48
in the middle of your eye or
something like that.

415
00:35:48 --> 00:35:52
So things in development tend to be
once you're off you're off or once

416
00:35:52 --> 00:35:56
you're on you're on or something.
And just to give you another little

417
00:35:56 --> 00:36:00
look at that picture I've shown you
before of the nematode.

418
00:36:00 --> 00:36:03
And at the time,
the first time I showed you this,

419
00:36:03 --> 00:36:07
I was just trying to emphasize that
we could take the gene encoding

420
00:36:07 --> 00:36:11
green fluorescent protein and put it
in anything and it would go green.

421
00:36:11 --> 00:36:15
In this case, Barbara Meyer who is
at Berkeley now but used to be my

422
00:36:15 --> 00:36:19
office-mate at MIT for many years,
what she's done is she's taken that

423
00:36:19 --> 00:36:23
green fluorescent protein,
the gene for that, and she's put it

424
00:36:23 --> 00:36:27
under the control of a regulatory
system, a gene that is made to be

425
00:36:27 --> 00:36:31
expressed in the esophagus
of the worm.

426
00:36:31 --> 00:36:35
And so even though that gene is
present in all the cells of that

427
00:36:35 --> 00:36:39
organism, it's under the control of
a system that usually permits the

428
00:36:39 --> 00:36:44
genes to be made that are needed for
making esophagus but not in other

429
00:36:44 --> 00:36:48
parts of the body.
So you probably didn't pick that

430
00:36:48 --> 00:36:53
part up now but sort of take another
look at that same thing and see

431
00:36:53 --> 00:36:57
something different.
So how do we learn about gene

432
00:36:57 --> 00:37:03
regulation?
The key work, like so many of these

433
00:37:03 --> 00:37:09
things, started kind of
inauspiciously,

434
00:37:09 --> 00:37:16
if you will.  There were two French
scientists, Jacques Monod,

435
00:37:16 --> 00:37:23
who is a biochemist, Francois Jacob
who was a geneticist.

436
00:37:23 --> 00:37:30
And they were working on the
metabolism of lactose by E. coli.

437
00:37:30 --> 00:37:36
Lactose is galactose,
beta 1,4 glucose.  And you don't

438
00:37:36 --> 00:37:42
have to know exactly the structure.
You can just remember there were a

439
00:37:42 --> 00:37:49
lot of different hydroxyls,
and that was one particular linkage.

440
00:37:49 --> 00:37:55
And there's an enzyme that cleaves
this into galactose and glucose.

441
00:37:55 --> 00:38:01
And this can go right into
glycolysis and make energy

442
00:38:01 --> 00:38:07
for the organism.
And the galactose undergoes a couple

443
00:38:07 --> 00:38:12
of different transformations,
and it can get in there as well.

444
00:38:12 --> 00:38:17
But in order to get at the energy
that's in those carbohydrates,

445
00:38:17 --> 00:38:22
this linkage has to be broken.  And
it was broken by an enzyme called

446
00:38:22 --> 00:38:27
beta-galactosidase.
That's a protein that's able to

447
00:38:27 --> 00:38:32
catalyze the cleavage
of those two sugars.

448
00:38:32 --> 00:38:39
That's what Jacques Monod and
Francois Jacob were studying.

449
00:38:39 --> 00:38:46
They were helped out in this
exercise.  I guess part of the

450
00:38:46 --> 00:38:53
reason they got going on this was
people had noticed for many years

451
00:38:53 --> 00:39:00
that if you grew E.
coli in glucose there was no

452
00:39:00 --> 00:39:08
beta-gal.
I'm going to abbreviate this as

453
00:39:08 --> 00:39:16
beta-gal just so I won't have to
keep writing the same thing.

454
00:39:16 --> 00:39:25
But if they grew E. coli in lactose
beta-gal was present.

455
00:39:25 --> 00:39:34
And they had to be able to assay
for this enzyme.  And they used --

456
00:39:34 --> 00:39:43
There were standard types of

457
00:39:43 --> 00:39:47
biochemical assays you could use.
But some chemists that helped

458
00:39:47 --> 00:39:52
design a very cleaver kind of
substrate that helped them,

459
00:39:52 --> 00:39:57
that could be used in these kinds of
studies, and I'll show you one of

460
00:39:57 --> 00:40:01
them.  What this enzyme really looks
at is it looks at, let's

461
00:40:01 --> 00:40:06
see, galactose.
What it sees is sort of the

462
00:40:06 --> 00:40:10
galactose side of this linkage,
and then it reaches in and catalyzes

463
00:40:10 --> 00:40:14
the cleavage of what's joined to it.
And it turns out not to be specific

464
00:40:14 --> 00:40:18
for whether glucose is on the other
side.  It can accept substrates that

465
00:40:18 --> 00:40:22
have other things as well.
So some chemists made some variants

466
00:40:22 --> 00:40:26
like this.  This is a compound
that's commonly known as X-gal.

467
00:40:26 --> 00:40:31
If you talk to it in the lab it's
got a longer chemical name.

468
00:40:31 --> 00:40:36
But what happens if
beta-galactosidase is there,

469
00:40:36 --> 00:40:41
it's able to cleave this substrate
so you get galactose,

470
00:40:41 --> 00:40:46
which is colorless.  But if you get
just X, this is colored,

471
00:40:46 --> 00:40:51
but up here this original material
is also colorless.

472
00:40:51 --> 00:40:56
So this is very convenient because
if you use a substrate such as this

473
00:40:56 --> 00:41:02
you could put the cells on a plate
with this indicator.

474
00:41:02 --> 00:41:05
And if they are colored,
and the color is blue, you'd know

475
00:41:05 --> 00:41:09
they were making beta-galactosidase.
And if you don't see a color, you

476
00:41:09 --> 00:41:13
know they're not.
There are a variety of ways of

477
00:41:13 --> 00:41:17
assaying for this enzyme.
With that I'm just trying to give

478
00:41:17 --> 00:41:21
you a little bit of flavor of one of
the different ways that they could

479
00:41:21 --> 00:41:25
assay for it.  Now,
one of the issues was it looked as

480
00:41:25 --> 00:41:29
though E. coli didn't have any
beta-galactosidase activity if

481
00:41:29 --> 00:41:33
lactose was absent when
growing a glucose.

482
00:41:33 --> 00:41:36
And they made it if lactose was
present.  Well,

483
00:41:36 --> 00:41:40
that would be kind of what you would
expect evolution would have figured

484
00:41:40 --> 00:41:44
out how to do,
only make the enzyme for

485
00:41:44 --> 00:41:48
metabolizing lactose if the lactose
is present, but they had to figure

486
00:41:48 --> 00:41:52
out what the molecular basis of this
was.  And one of the possibilities

487
00:41:52 --> 00:41:56
was that the protein was made that
it was all sort of unfolded,

488
00:41:56 --> 00:42:00
and when the substrate came in then
it folded all around it and then it

489
00:42:00 --> 00:42:03
could cleave it.
Or another possibility,

490
00:42:03 --> 00:42:07
which would be the kind we're
talking about now,

491
00:42:07 --> 00:42:11
is the protein is not made until the
lactose is present,

492
00:42:11 --> 00:42:14
and then it makes it new.
So they had to figure out,

493
00:42:14 --> 00:42:18
between these two, which of these
two was true.  When you see the

494
00:42:18 --> 00:42:22
lactose present,
is it just beta-galactosidase is

495
00:42:22 --> 00:42:26
already made but it's inactive,
or is it being made de novo when you

496
00:42:26 --> 00:42:32
add the lactose?
So what they did was they grew cells

497
00:42:32 --> 00:42:40
in glucose plus radioactive
C14-leucine for a long time.

498
00:42:40 --> 00:42:53
So all the proteins --

499
00:42:53 --> 00:42:56
-- were radioactive.
And once they got, that's going for

500
00:42:56 --> 00:43:00
a long time.  So every protein being
made is radioactive.

501
00:43:00 --> 00:43:07
Then they add excess unlabeled
leucine.  So this means that from

502
00:43:07 --> 00:43:14
now on any new proteins that are
made will not be radioactive because

503
00:43:14 --> 00:43:21
you're just going to swamp out any
radioactive stuff with this.

504
00:43:21 --> 00:43:29
And they added glucose, excuse me,
now they added lactose through the

505
00:43:29 --> 00:43:35
cells.
And then they isolated the beta-gal

506
00:43:35 --> 00:43:40
enzyme.  It was actually pretty easy
to do.  It's a huge enzyme and it's

507
00:43:40 --> 00:43:45
a tetramer.  So very large.
Even in those days it was fairly

508
00:43:45 --> 00:43:50
easy to isolate this enzyme.
And then they looked to see is it

509
00:43:50 --> 00:43:55
radioactive?  If it's radioactive it
was there all along and it's

510
00:43:55 --> 00:44:00
refolded to become the
active enzyme.

511
00:44:00 --> 00:44:05
Or if it had been only after lactose
then it would be made de novo in

512
00:44:05 --> 00:44:10
response to it.
And what they found was that it was

513
00:44:10 --> 00:44:19
non-radioactive.

514
00:44:19 --> 00:44:32
Which implied that it was made after
you added the lactose.

515
00:44:32 --> 00:44:38
So they knew then that they were
studying a system in which a protein

516
00:44:38 --> 00:44:44
was only made after the cells had
experienced a particular growth

517
00:44:44 --> 00:44:50
substrate.  And so a lot of work
went into figuring out how this

518
00:44:50 --> 00:44:56
system worked.
Let's see.  We're a little short on

519
00:44:56 --> 00:45:01
time.
So I'll tell you what I'll do.

520
00:45:01 --> 00:45:06
I'll tell you, I'll just put out
quickly the mechanics of what they

521
00:45:06 --> 00:45:10
saw, and we'll start in on the
regulation on how this works.

522
00:45:10 --> 00:45:15
And some of you may be able to
figure it out.

523
00:45:15 --> 00:45:20
What we now know is that the gene
that encodes beta-galactosidase is

524
00:45:20 --> 00:45:25
in a stretch of DNA that's pretty
interesting.  It's got three genes.

525
00:45:25 --> 00:45:30
It's the gene lacZ.  This is the
gene for beta-galactosidase.

526
00:45:30 --> 00:45:37
And another gene called lacY and
lacZ.  There's a promoter.

527
00:45:37 --> 00:45:45
That's a start signal for
transcription.

528
00:45:45 --> 00:45:52
Remember that?
So there's a sequence here that

529
00:45:52 --> 00:46:00
says start transcription.
Down here is a terminator.

530
00:46:00 --> 00:46:06
Another word written in the nucleic
acid alphabet that means stop making

531
00:46:06 --> 00:46:12
mRNA.  And there is one long mRNA,
as you can see, that has the

532
00:46:12 --> 00:46:19
peculiarity of encoding three
different genes.

533
00:46:19 --> 00:46:25
So if you have more than one gene
in a single message then that's

534
00:46:25 --> 00:46:40
called an operon.

535
00:46:40 --> 00:46:46
You've got one mRNA.
But, in any case, so whenever

536
00:46:46 --> 00:46:52
beta-galactosidase was being made
then RNA has to start being made

537
00:46:52 --> 00:46:58
here, goes to there.
And we won't worry about the

538
00:46:58 --> 00:47:03
functions of these other two genes.
But, as you might guess from the way

539
00:47:03 --> 00:47:08
evolution has selected for it,
they have related activities to what

540
00:47:08 --> 00:47:12
beta-galactosidase does.
And for bacteria it's a very

541
00:47:12 --> 00:47:17
efficient way to control the
expression of a bunch of genes at

542
00:47:17 --> 00:47:22
once.  Then there was another gene
up here known as lacI that had a

543
00:47:22 --> 00:47:27
promoter and a terminator,
and it made an mRNA as well.

544
00:47:27 --> 00:47:34
And that mRNA encoded a protein
that's known as the lac repressor.

545
00:47:34 --> 00:47:42
And what that lac repressor does,
it's a protein that has the ability

546
00:47:42 --> 00:47:49
to recognize a very,
very specific DNA sequence and bind

547
00:47:49 --> 00:47:57
there.  And I'm just going to kind
of blow up this part of the thing.

548
00:47:57 --> 00:48:04
So what we have here is the,
this is the promoter here.  And it

549
00:48:04 --> 00:48:11
happens that the binding
sequence --

550
00:48:11 --> 00:48:22
-- for lac repressor overlaps with

551
00:48:22 --> 00:48:32
the promoter.  Weird,
right?  Maybe not.

552
00:48:32 --> 00:48:36
So I'll tell you,
well, you can think about this over

553
00:48:36 --> 00:48:41
the weekend, if you haven't run into
this system before.

554
00:48:41 --> 00:48:45
So this gene gets made all the time.
So this protein gets made all the

555
00:48:45 --> 00:48:50
time.  What does that protein do if
it's just like this?

556
00:48:50 --> 00:48:55
Its job in life is to look for this
sequence and bind to it.

557
00:48:55 --> 00:49:00
If it binds to it, it covers up the
promoter.

558
00:49:00 --> 00:49:04
And the beta-galactosidase gene is
not expressed because the cell

559
00:49:04 --> 00:49:09
cannot make mRNA.
So this may seem a little obscure,

560
00:49:09 --> 00:49:14
but there's something very important
here.  Now the conditionality on

561
00:49:14 --> 00:49:19
whether this gene is expressed or
not is controlled by a protein,

562
00:49:19 --> 00:49:23
right?  It's controlled by this lac
repressor.  If it's on there the

563
00:49:23 --> 00:49:28
gene will be made.
And if it's off the gene now you

564
00:49:28 --> 00:49:33
can make it.
There's a promoter and the RNA

565
00:49:33 --> 00:49:38
polymerase will see it.
And so you've learned something

566
00:49:38 --> 00:49:44
about proteins.
They can bind various things.

567
00:49:44 --> 00:49:49
And so what lac repressor has,
it's got a little binding site that

568
00:49:49 --> 00:49:54
lactose is able to bind to and
change the confirmation of the lac

569
00:49:54 --> 00:49:59
repressor.  So why don't you take
those pieces of information and see

570
00:49:59 --> 00:50:05
if you can figure out how
the circuitry goes.

571
00:50:05 --> 00:50:11
Yeah?  Did I do something wrong?
Sorry.  Oh, sorry.  Excuse me.  Yes,

572
00:50:11 --> 00:50:17
Z-Y-A.  Excuse me.
OK?  We'll walk through that on

573
00:50:17 --> 00:50:23
Monday, but focus on the fact that
if the repressor is there and

574
00:50:23 --> 00:50:30
lactose isn't, it binds
to this sequence.

575
00:50:30 --> 00:50:34
The repressor is made all the time,
but this repressor is something that

576
00:50:34 --> 00:50:39
can tell you whether lactose is
there or not.  So you can put the

577
00:50:39 --> 00:50:42
circuit together, OK?
