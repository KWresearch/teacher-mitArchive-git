1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
I've emphasized in the first lecture,
you know, that there's a lot of

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:08
stuff that happens just in your
ordinary life.

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:12
I saw two examples of this.
Yesterday's Boston Globe, just on

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:16
the front page there was a discovery
about “Heart Cell Discovery Raises

5
00:00:16 --> 00:00:20
Treatment Hopes”.
Scientists announced yesterday the

6
00:00:20 --> 00:00:24
discovery of cells in the heart that
can create new muscle cells raising

7
00:00:24 --> 00:00:29
hopes that doctors may find dramatic
new ways to treat heart disease.

8
00:00:29 --> 00:00:32
The team showed that the cells,
which are similar to stem cells,

9
00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
can be expanded from just a few
hundred in the laboratory dish up to

10
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
more than a million.
And these can be guiding into

11
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
becoming the pulsing muscles that
power the heart.

12
00:00:41 --> 00:00:44
So when we were talking about those
yeast dividing and saying how one

13
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
cell becomes two,
this is a general principle

14
00:00:47 --> 00:00:51
throughout life that cells come from
other cells and they divide.

15
00:00:51 --> 00:00:54
And we'll see the relationship to
that with DNA replication as we go

16
00:00:54 --> 00:00:57
along.  In the case of yeast,
as I said, they're just always the

17
00:00:57 --> 00:01:00
same.
Your progeny are always the same.

18
00:01:00 --> 00:01:04
But in something like our own cells
we start out as a single fertilized

19
00:01:04 --> 00:01:08
cell but somewhere along the way the
cells have to become specialized.

20
00:01:08 --> 00:01:12
So the very early ones are the
embryonic stem cells.

21
00:01:12 --> 00:01:15
They have the potential to become
any cell in the body.

22
00:01:15 --> 00:01:19
But at some point, at one of these
cell divisions the cells are going

23
00:01:19 --> 00:01:23
to have to start to become more
specialized.  And,

24
00:01:23 --> 00:01:27
for example, this one might be a
lineage that would lead to heart

25
00:01:27 --> 00:01:31
muscle or to becoming a
nerve or something.

26
00:01:31 --> 00:01:35
And at that point it loses its
ability to become any cell in the

27
00:01:35 --> 00:01:39
body.  And in many cases by the time
you get out ultimately to the final

28
00:01:39 --> 00:01:43
cell that's making up the muscle or
the nerve or something it has no

29
00:01:43 --> 00:01:47
capacity to regenerate.
So that's why, for example,

30
00:01:47 --> 00:01:51
spinal cord injuries are so damaging
because nerves at this point cannot

31
00:01:51 --> 00:01:55
be regenerated.
Or heart disease,

32
00:01:55 --> 00:02:00
you get a damaged heart we're stuck.
This is why this result is exciting.

33
00:02:00 --> 00:02:04
Because there seem to be at least a
few cells in the heart that have the

34
00:02:04 --> 00:02:08
capacity to regenerate more heart
muscle.  Now, this is early on.

35
00:02:08 --> 00:02:13
It hasn't been rigorously shown to
be a stem cell.

36
00:02:13 --> 00:02:17
But there's an example from the
front of yesterday's paper about

37
00:02:17 --> 00:02:21
something we were virtually alluding
to in class.  There was also an

38
00:02:21 --> 00:02:26
article about AIDS testing.
Again, you know, we're talk more

39
00:02:26 --> 00:02:30
about the HIV-1 virus.
And then today on the front page of

40
00:02:30 --> 00:02:35
the Boston Globe yet again is
“Romney Draws Fire on Stem Cells”.

41
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
And you can look at this.
But, you know, he's sort of trying

42
00:02:39 --> 00:02:44
to straddle, I guess,
between being supportive of research

43
00:02:44 --> 00:02:49
on the one hand and the concerns of
the conservatives and the religious

44
00:02:49 --> 00:02:54
right on the other hand,
and he's drawing fire from both

45
00:02:54 --> 00:02:59
sides.  But it's an issue that is in
our society today.

46
00:02:59 --> 00:03:03
You're going to be expected to make
decisions on it,

47
00:03:03 --> 00:03:08
to know about it and understand.
I'm just trying to drive home that

48
00:03:08 --> 00:03:12
what we're talking about isn't
taking place in a vacuum.

49
00:03:12 --> 00:03:17
Nobody emailed me an idea as to
what happened here.

50
00:03:17 --> 00:03:22
I showed you this little movie.
This is water that is cooled below

51
00:03:22 --> 00:03:26
the freezing point but hasn't formed
ice crystals, but if we put a little

52
00:03:26 --> 00:03:31
bit of this pseudomonas syringae in
it then somehow that super-cooled

53
00:03:31 --> 00:03:35
water turned into ice.
And I told you it was a protein on

54
00:03:35 --> 00:03:39
the surface.  Nobody had any ideas.
So why don't you turn to whoever is

55
00:03:39 --> 00:03:43
close to you and you can talk about
it for 30 seconds and see if anybody

56
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
can come up with an idea as to why.
All right?  I won't look.  You know,

57
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
just go ahead.
Talk to somebody and come up with

58
00:03:50 --> 00:04:32
an idea.

59
00:04:32 --> 00:04:36
OK.  Well, let's see.
Did we manage to get any ideas?

60
00:04:36 --> 00:04:41
Anybody got the courage to try and
guess what that protein might be

61
00:04:41 --> 00:04:45
doing?  Pardon?
It's a nonpolar molecule.

62
00:04:45 --> 00:04:50
It's not disturbing the bonds.
It's an interesting idea.  Do you

63
00:04:50 --> 00:04:55
have an idea then,
are you able to extend that as to

64
00:04:55 --> 00:05:00
why then the ice would
start to form?

65
00:05:00 --> 00:05:04
I mean it's certainly true that
nonpolar bonds sort of interfere

66
00:05:04 --> 00:05:08
with the water.
That's something we've talked about.

67
00:05:08 --> 00:05:12
Let's see.  Any other ideas?
Yeah?  That's a version of the same

68
00:05:12 --> 00:05:16
idea, I think,
hydrophobic because you think it

69
00:05:16 --> 00:05:20
wants to repel the water and push it
together.  That's interesting.

70
00:05:20 --> 00:05:24
You're sort of getting closer on
these.  Yeah?

71
00:05:24 --> 00:05:40
There it is.  If you were to design

72
00:05:40 --> 00:05:45
a protein that basically could bind
water molecules in a lattice that

73
00:05:45 --> 00:05:49
mimicked what you found in ice then
the water molecules coming up and

74
00:05:49 --> 00:05:54
binding to these little pockets in
the protein would present then a

75
00:05:54 --> 00:05:59
little field of stable water
molecules that looked to the next

76
00:05:59 --> 00:06:04
water molecule like it was part of
an ice crystal.

77
00:06:04 --> 00:06:08
And that's indeed how that bacterium
does that trick.

78
00:06:08 --> 00:06:13
It's called the ice nucleation
protein.  And they do things like

79
00:06:13 --> 00:06:17
take this bacterium and they put it
into things like when you're doing

80
00:06:17 --> 00:06:22
snowmaking, you put this in and then
you spray the super-cooled water,

81
00:06:22 --> 00:06:26
and this makes it go into ice
crystals and then it helps you get

82
00:06:26 --> 00:06:31
nice snow for ski resorts
and things.

83
00:06:31 --> 00:06:37
That's at least one of the areas
where it's used.

84
00:06:37 --> 00:06:43
OK.  So I'm just going to show you
this movie again.

85
00:06:43 --> 00:06:49
These are just baker's yeast,
saccharomyces cerevisiae, a kind of

86
00:06:49 --> 00:06:55
single-celled yeast that's used in
baking bread or making beer.

87
00:06:55 --> 00:07:00
And here we're seeing cells divide.
And this particular kind of yeast

88
00:07:00 --> 00:07:04
has a way of doing,
it kind of buds the daughter off

89
00:07:04 --> 00:07:07
from the side.
Some double and then split down the

90
00:07:07 --> 00:07:11
middle.  But you can see what's
going on.  There's a lot of cell

91
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
growth going on.
And the issue that we're going to

92
00:07:14 --> 00:07:18
address now is where does the energy
come that's needed to do that?

93
00:07:18 --> 00:07:22
You know from your own experience
that to build things,

94
00:07:22 --> 00:07:25
to make things takes energy.
You cannot put up a bridge, you

95
00:07:25 --> 00:07:29
cannot put up a building,
you cannot build a computer chip

96
00:07:29 --> 00:07:32
without somehow putting energy in.
You're taking a bunch of matter in

97
00:07:32 --> 00:07:36
the universe and ordering it in a
very specific way making new

98
00:07:36 --> 00:07:40
contacts that didn't be there.
It's an energy-requiring process.

99
00:07:40 --> 00:07:43
And I'm going to talk today about
where that energy comes from.

100
00:07:43 --> 00:07:47
And then I want to tell you a
little bit, just a very brief

101
00:07:47 --> 00:07:50
historical thing along the way,
because a point I've emphasized here

102
00:07:50 --> 00:07:54
is biology is an experimental
science.  And many of the greatest

103
00:07:54 --> 00:07:58
discoveries weren't because somebody
had the idea and then went

104
00:07:58 --> 00:08:02
out to prove it.
Very often we didn't even understand

105
00:08:02 --> 00:08:07
how it worked.
And somebody was investigating a

106
00:08:07 --> 00:08:11
phenomenon, found some peculiar
things, and then began to get

107
00:08:11 --> 00:08:16
insights.  And the insights were
what then led to a fundamental

108
00:08:16 --> 00:08:21
increase in our understanding.
And this little bit of history

109
00:08:21 --> 00:08:26
involves some names that you see on
the MIT buildings around here.

110
00:08:26 --> 00:08:31
One is Lavoisier who is a French
scientist.

111
00:08:31 --> 00:08:39
And he was studying what happened
when grapes were converted into wine,

112
00:08:39 --> 00:08:47
a good topic for a French scientist
to be studying.

113
00:08:47 --> 00:08:55
So, in essence,
what he was studying was glucose

114
00:08:55 --> 00:09:03
being converted to two molecules,
excuse me, of --

115
00:09:03 --> 00:09:12
-- ethanol and two molecules of

116
00:09:12 --> 00:09:20
carbon dioxide.
This transformation,

117
00:09:20 --> 00:09:28
there's C6H12O6.  Remember,
carbohydrates have that composition.

118
00:09:28 --> 00:09:34
And so he was studying that.

119
00:09:34 --> 00:09:39
He managed to figure out that's
what happened to the sugar when you

120
00:09:39 --> 00:09:44
were making the wine.
And at that point he got beheaded.

121
00:09:44 --> 00:09:49
That terminated that part of his
investigation.

122
00:09:49 --> 00:09:54
But this problem was then picked up
by Lois Pasteur who,

123
00:09:54 --> 00:09:59
again, his name is on one of the MIT
buildings.

124
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02
He worked in France as well.
There's a Pasteur Institute in

125
00:10:02 --> 00:10:06
Paris.  There's a nice museum in
Lille in Northern France that has a

126
00:10:06 --> 00:10:10
lot of this.  But he grew up in
Arbois which is a town in sort of

127
00:10:10 --> 00:10:14
Eastern France that,
as you can see from the little

128
00:10:14 --> 00:10:18
picture of the village,
winemaking was a major industry.

129
00:10:18 --> 00:10:22
So he was interested in that
probably from when he was a small,

130
00:10:22 --> 00:10:26
small kid, although probably not
dressed like that.  But anyway.

131
00:10:26 --> 00:10:31
So one of the issues that he took on,
which was a real problem for the

132
00:10:31 --> 00:10:37
wine growers in his little town and
in France in general was sometimes

133
00:10:37 --> 00:10:42
wines would go bad.
They'd come out sour and couldn't

134
00:10:42 --> 00:10:48
be drunk and then you'd lose all the
profit that would have come from

135
00:10:48 --> 00:10:53
that wine.  So there was a lot of
interest in trying to figure out how

136
00:10:53 --> 00:10:59
to prevent wines from going bad.
And so Lois Pasteur started to

137
00:10:59 --> 00:11:04
study this.  And he discovered that
there was this conversion that had

138
00:11:04 --> 00:11:10
been figured out now of two ethanol
and two carbon dioxide.

139
00:11:10 --> 00:11:15
So this was a conversion.
And we now refer to it generally as

140
00:11:15 --> 00:11:21
“a fermentation”.
But what he discovered with this

141
00:11:21 --> 00:11:33
conversion occurred --

142
00:11:33 --> 00:11:39
-- if yeast were present.
That the rate of this conversion

143
00:11:39 --> 00:11:45
varied as the number of yeast,
so it went faster if there were more

144
00:11:45 --> 00:11:52
yeast.  And the yeast
stopped growing --

145
00:11:52 --> 00:12:04
-- when the sugar ran out.

146
00:12:04 --> 00:12:08
So what he discovered here was a
correlation.  He hadn't proven

147
00:12:08 --> 00:12:12
anything.  He just saw that if you
watch sugar go to ethanol there were

148
00:12:12 --> 00:12:16
yeast around, if you had more yeast
it went faster,

149
00:12:16 --> 00:12:21
and when you ran out of sugar the
yeast stopped growing.

150
00:12:21 --> 00:12:25
There was something connected here.
So he came up with the idea that

151
00:12:25 --> 00:12:29
the yeast were responsible for this
conversion that was happening

152
00:12:29 --> 00:12:33
when you made wine.
And it was further helped out in

153
00:12:33 --> 00:12:37
this because he discovered
an alternative --

154
00:12:37 --> 00:12:48
-- conversion in which C6H12O6 went

155
00:12:48 --> 00:12:56
instead to give two molecules of
CH3CHOH.  This molecule which you

156
00:12:56 --> 00:13:05
know, galactic acid,
it too has C6H12O6 on both sides of

157
00:13:05 --> 00:13:14
the equation but it's a
different molecule.

158
00:13:14 --> 00:13:18
And what he found was that this is
the lactic acid you know as what's

159
00:13:18 --> 00:13:22
in yogurt.  It makes yogurt sour.
Or if you exercise really hard and

160
00:13:22 --> 00:13:26
your muscles are sore that's because
you accumulate lactic acid in your

161
00:13:26 --> 00:13:31
muscles, and I'll tell you why that
is in the next lecture.

162
00:13:31 --> 00:13:35
But what the other thing that
Pasteur realized was when you got

163
00:13:35 --> 00:13:39
this alternative conversion you
didn't have yeast present,

164
00:13:39 --> 00:13:43
you had some other organism.
And so that was a huge advance just

165
00:13:43 --> 00:13:47
of practical value to the winemakers
because they knew they had to have

166
00:13:47 --> 00:13:51
yeast in there to get wine and there
problems were coming when some other

167
00:13:51 --> 00:13:55
organism that wasn't yeast got in
there and it did something different

168
00:13:55 --> 00:13:59
with the sugar and made it into
lactic acid instead of making it

169
00:13:59 --> 00:14:04
into ethanol and carbon dioxide.
So there was Pasteur working away on

170
00:14:04 --> 00:14:10
a practical problem and it was,
you know, a really major advance to

171
00:14:10 --> 00:14:16
the winemaking industry for him to
do this, but it also then sort of

172
00:14:16 --> 00:14:22
unexpectedly led to another issue.
And that was why were the yeast

173
00:14:22 --> 00:14:28
doing this?  Because one of the
things that Lavoisier had noticed

174
00:14:28 --> 00:14:34
and Pasteur noticed was that you did
this conversion.

175
00:14:34 --> 00:14:40
The two ethanol plus two carbon

176
00:14:40 --> 00:14:45
dioxide.  But you could account for
virtually all of the carbon and

177
00:14:45 --> 00:14:51
hydrogens and oxygens that started
out as sugar and seemed like

178
00:14:51 --> 00:14:56
virtually of them showed up in the
ethanol and the carbon dioxide.

179
00:14:56 --> 00:15:01
So why was the yeast doing this?
And the idea began to develop out of

180
00:15:01 --> 00:15:05
that was that rather than being used
to make biomass,

181
00:15:05 --> 00:15:10
in which case you would have
expected to see a whole lot of mass

182
00:15:10 --> 00:15:14
in the yeast cells and no so much up
here, that instead most of this

183
00:15:14 --> 00:15:19
sugar was being used to make energy
and that somehow the cell was

184
00:15:19 --> 00:15:23
getting the energy necessary to all
that synthetic work involved in cell

185
00:15:23 --> 00:15:28
division by carrying out
this conversion.

186
00:15:28 --> 00:15:34
And there's a fundamental
relationship then between chemical

187
00:15:34 --> 00:15:40
energy and whether a reaction can
proceed.  And I'll just take it

188
00:15:40 --> 00:15:47
through in sort of your typical
introductory chemistry reaction,

189
00:15:47 --> 00:15:53
A plus B going to C plus D.  You
know, there are certain classes of

190
00:15:53 --> 00:16:00
reactions that will go
almost to completion.

191
00:16:00 --> 00:16:04
Probably an overstatement to say
it's to go to completion,

192
00:16:04 --> 00:16:08
but it's effectively over here.
Those are termed irreversible

193
00:16:08 --> 00:16:12
reactions, and there are certainly
some of them.  If I have hydrogen

194
00:16:12 --> 00:16:17
and oxygen and I light a little
match, you pretty much go all the

195
00:16:17 --> 00:16:21
way to making water with a great big
boom and no hydrogen or not much

196
00:16:21 --> 00:16:25
hydrogen and oxygen left on the
other side.  However,

197
00:16:25 --> 00:16:30
most reactions that one finds in
nature don't have that quality.

198
00:16:30 --> 00:16:36
Instead they are going forward at
some rate and back at another.

199
00:16:36 --> 00:16:42
And they reach eventually an
equilibrium that's characterized by

200
00:16:42 --> 00:16:48
what's known as an equilibrium
constant which is the product of the

201
00:16:48 --> 00:16:54
concentrations of the products over
the product of the concentration of

202
00:16:54 --> 00:16:59
the reactants.
And that's a characteristic of every

203
00:16:59 --> 00:17:03
particular chemical reaction.
And we really have to worry about

204
00:17:03 --> 00:17:07
this in biology because if
everything was irreversible that

205
00:17:07 --> 00:17:11
would be fine,
but in order to do all this

206
00:17:11 --> 00:17:16
synthetic work you have to deal with
a lot of reactions that aren't going

207
00:17:16 --> 00:17:20
to go to completion.
And nature has had to figure out a

208
00:17:20 --> 00:17:24
way of doing that,
just the same way that bridges and

209
00:17:24 --> 00:17:28
buildings don't spontaneously
assemble and engineers and others

210
00:17:28 --> 00:17:33
have had to work out ways of putting
all of those things together.

211
00:17:33 --> 00:17:39
So at some level you see the same
kind of problem.

212
00:17:39 --> 00:17:45
Now, there's a way of expressing
this energy associated with a

213
00:17:45 --> 00:17:51
chemical reaction that can be used
to directly calculate whether a

214
00:17:51 --> 00:17:57
reaction is going to go and how far
it will go.  And a person who did

215
00:17:57 --> 00:18:03
this work is another person who's on
one of the MIT buildings.

216
00:18:03 --> 00:18:09
It was [Willard?
Gibbs who was a faculty member

217
00:18:09 --> 00:18:15
chemist who worked at Yale in the
1980s, excuse me,

218
00:18:15 --> 00:18:21
1800s, and he came up with an
expression that's now known as

219
00:18:21 --> 00:18:27
“Gibbs free energy”.
And what's important about this way

220
00:18:27 --> 00:18:33
of talking about the energy change
associated with the chemical

221
00:18:33 --> 00:18:39
reaction is it considers not only
the internal energy of the system

222
00:18:39 --> 00:18:44
but also the change in disorder.
Or another way of saying that,

223
00:18:44 --> 00:18:48
for those of you who've run into the
laws of thermodynamics,

224
00:18:48 --> 00:18:52
it combines the first and second
laws of thermodynamics.

225
00:18:52 --> 00:18:56
And you have to consider both of
those if you're going to consider

226
00:18:56 --> 00:19:01
whether a reaction will go.
And you cannot measure an absolute

227
00:19:01 --> 00:19:07
free energy but you can measure a
change.  And this is the equation.

228
00:19:07 --> 00:19:13
It's the change associated with a
chemical reaction is equal to the

229
00:19:13 --> 00:19:19
change associated with the chemical
reaction under some set of standard

230
00:19:19 --> 00:19:25
conditions times RT times the log of
the concentration of the products

231
00:19:25 --> 00:19:32
multiplied together over the
concentration of the reactants.

232
00:19:32 --> 00:19:38
So if we could just go to the same
example we were just thinking about,

233
00:19:38 --> 00:19:45
the energy change with that reaction
that we were considering

234
00:19:45 --> 00:19:54
would have been this.

235
00:19:54 --> 00:20:07
So this is the energy change --

236
00:20:07 --> 00:20:10
-- associated with the
concentrations --

237
00:20:10 --> 00:20:19
-- the reactants and products that

238
00:20:19 --> 00:20:27
we're considering.

239
00:20:27 --> 00:20:32
This is the energy change under
standard, or the term standard

240
00:20:32 --> 00:20:38
conditions where everything,
each reactant, each product is

241
00:20:38 --> 00:20:44
present under one molar
concentrations.

242
00:20:44 --> 00:20:50
So not something you'd ever find in
most cases, but it's a frame of

243
00:20:50 --> 00:20:56
reference.  And then this is the
universal gas constant --

244
00:20:56 --> 00:21:04
-- which is two times ten to the

245
00:21:04 --> 00:21:11
minus third kilocalories per mole
per degree Calvin,

246
00:21:11 --> 00:21:17
the temperature in absolute.
This is the temperature in degrees

247
00:21:17 --> 00:21:24
Calvin.  And the temperature for
most biology, most life is around 25

248
00:21:24 --> 00:21:31
degrees Centigrade,
so that's equal to 298 degrees

249
00:21:31 --> 00:21:38
Calvin, which is about equal to 300
degrees Calvin.  So for most --

250
00:21:38 --> 00:21:43
And since the range in which life
can occur on an absolute temperature

251
00:21:43 --> 00:21:48
scale is really pretty small,
it sort of fluctuates in only very

252
00:21:48 --> 00:21:53
minor ways around 25 degrees
Centigrade, then for most of the

253
00:21:53 --> 00:21:59
biological reactions we'll be
thinking about this RT number is

254
00:21:59 --> 00:22:08
about 0.6 kilocalories per mole.

255
00:22:08 --> 00:22:15
Now, biochemists actually have a
special form of free energy they use,

256
00:22:15 --> 00:22:23
which we put a delta G prime.
And in this case the delta G prime

257
00:22:23 --> 00:22:31
is equal to delta G prime under a
set of standard conditions plus RT

258
00:22:31 --> 00:22:39
natural log of C products
over the reactants.

259
00:22:39 --> 00:22:46
But the assumption is made that the
reaction is in water which,

260
00:22:46 --> 00:22:54
I mentioned the other day, is 55
molar.  Yeah?

261
00:22:54 --> 00:23:03
This is the degree Celsius.

262
00:23:03 --> 00:23:08
I've just expressed it in degrees
Calvin.

263
00:23:08 --> 00:23:21
Sorry.  My mistake.

264
00:23:21 --> 00:23:27
Excuse me.  Because I was wrong is
why.  OK.  Thanks for catching

265
00:23:27 --> 00:23:32
that.  All right.
So water is very concentrated.

266
00:23:32 --> 00:23:36
And so under these conditions the
other convention is then you can set

267
00:23:36 --> 00:23:41
the hydrogen ions and water
molecules to one.

268
00:23:41 --> 00:23:46
And you don't have to think about
them when we're doing this.

269
00:23:46 --> 00:23:50
This is a convention that
biochemists do.

270
00:23:50 --> 00:23:55
Now, this free energy,
the delta G that gives free energy

271
00:23:55 --> 00:24:06
is a thermodynamic --

272
00:24:06 --> 00:24:12
-- property.  And I'll just share
with you the same visual image I've

273
00:24:12 --> 00:24:18
had since I was an undergrad,
which I think is not a bad way of

274
00:24:18 --> 00:24:24
thinking about it trying to
understand what happens,

275
00:24:24 --> 00:24:30
that if we have a plot of the free
energy as a function of what happens

276
00:24:30 --> 00:24:36
as the reaction goes along so that
we have A plus B here and

277
00:24:36 --> 00:24:42
C plus D down here.
When you go from reaction to

278
00:24:42 --> 00:24:46
products, the way I've drawn it,
some kind of energy is given off in

279
00:24:46 --> 00:24:50
this kind of reaction.
And if you know that you will know

280
00:24:50 --> 00:24:54
then that the reaction will be able
to go forward because it's able to

281
00:24:54 --> 00:24:58
give off energy just the same way
hydrogen and oxygen give off a lot

282
00:24:58 --> 00:25:02
of heat and stuff,
and you know that reaction really

283
00:25:02 --> 00:25:06
goes a long way to completion.
So it's kind of as if you were out

284
00:25:06 --> 00:25:11
here on your spring break on your
skis already to go down the black

285
00:25:11 --> 00:25:16
diamond hill, you know,
you can sort of see what would

286
00:25:16 --> 00:25:20
happen.  Now, because it's a
thermodynamic property it doesn't

287
00:25:20 --> 00:25:25
matter what route you take to get
from the reactions to the products.

288
00:25:25 --> 00:25:30
So if you go down the double
diamond slope or you go down the

289
00:25:30 --> 00:25:35
bunny slope you still end up with
the same amount of energy coming out

290
00:25:35 --> 00:25:40
of the reaction.
And that's important because if that

291
00:25:40 --> 00:25:46
wasn't true you could make a
perpetual motion machine and you'd

292
00:25:46 --> 00:25:51
be very rich.  The second thing
that's important is that the free

293
00:25:51 --> 00:25:57
energy will tell you what would
happen if the reaction went but it

294
00:25:57 --> 00:26:03
will not tell you whether
it can go.

295
00:26:03 --> 00:26:07
If I did a demo here and I brought
some hydrogen and some oxygen and I

296
00:26:07 --> 00:26:11
mixed them together in a vessel in
the front of the class we could all

297
00:26:11 --> 00:26:15
sit here waiting for it to explode.
But the likelihood is we would sit

298
00:26:15 --> 00:26:19
here for a very,
very long time and not see an

299
00:26:19 --> 00:26:23
explosion, right?
And the reason is that in order to

300
00:26:23 --> 00:26:27
get that hydrogen and oxygen close
enough together we had to give them

301
00:26:27 --> 00:26:32
some extra energy and push them so
they overcome repulsion and stuff.

302
00:26:32 --> 00:26:36
So if you were out here on your skis
again getting already to go,

303
00:26:36 --> 00:26:41
but in fact you got off at the wrong
stop on the ski lift and you were

304
00:26:41 --> 00:26:46
there, even though there would be
energy getting down from here it's

305
00:26:46 --> 00:26:51
not going to happen at any
discernable rate given the sort of

306
00:26:51 --> 00:26:56
little bounce in energy you have in
your normal lives.

307
00:26:56 --> 00:26:59
So what we're doing when we do
hydrogen and oxygen is by putting a

308
00:26:59 --> 00:27:03
match into it or something we're
giving it enough energy that

309
00:27:03 --> 00:27:06
actually a few of the molecules get
up here, they drop down,

310
00:27:06 --> 00:27:10
then they give up so much energy and
heat that all the rest of them get

311
00:27:10 --> 00:27:14
pushed up and the thing goes.
But that's sort of not a bad way of

312
00:27:14 --> 00:27:17
thinking about it.
And we're going to talk in a minute

313
00:27:17 --> 00:27:21
about what determines how fast
reactions go, not whether they go or

314
00:27:21 --> 00:27:25
not.  And then,
of course, at that point we're going

315
00:27:25 --> 00:27:29
to have to worry about this issue.
But before that what I want to show

316
00:27:29 --> 00:27:35
you is that there's a direct
relationship between this Gibbs free

317
00:27:35 --> 00:27:41
energy and the equilibrium constant.
So we have this, well, what we

318
00:27:41 --> 00:27:46
could do is you have the reaction
over there.  So let's consider that

319
00:27:46 --> 00:27:52
reaction has come to equilibrium.
And that means there'll be no

320
00:27:52 --> 00:27:58
further energy change.
So we'll just set the delta G to

321
00:27:58 --> 00:28:04
zero.
And that would mean then that delta

322
00:28:04 --> 00:28:10
G prime zero is equal to minus RT
concentration C over D over

323
00:28:10 --> 00:28:17
concentration of A over B.
You'll recognize this.  That's the

324
00:28:17 --> 00:28:23
equilibrium constant,
right?  I'm sorry.  There's a

325
00:28:23 --> 00:28:30
natural log in here.  I
didn't get it in.  OK?

326
00:28:30 --> 00:28:37
So which is equal to minus RT the
natural log of the equilibrium

327
00:28:37 --> 00:28:44
constant or the natural log of the
equilibrium constant is equal to

328
00:28:44 --> 00:28:51
minus delta G prime zero over RT.
Or another way of saying that is

329
00:28:51 --> 00:28:58
the K equilibrium is equal E to the
minus delta G prime zero over RT.

330
00:28:58 --> 00:29:02
So if you think back to consequences
of an equilibrium constant,

331
00:29:02 --> 00:29:07
if the reaction is going to go
almost all the way then there are

332
00:29:07 --> 00:29:12
going to be mostly products,
very few reactions, so the K

333
00:29:12 --> 00:29:17
equilibrium will be large.
So if a reaction is going to go a

334
00:29:17 --> 00:29:22
long way then the equilibrium
constant will be large.

335
00:29:22 --> 00:29:27
And in order for an equilibrium
constant to be large then this delta

336
00:29:27 --> 00:29:32
G is going to have to have a large
negative sign.  So if

337
00:29:32 --> 00:29:44
the reaction --

338
00:29:44 --> 00:29:52
-- is favorable then K equilibrium
will be large and the delta G prime

339
00:29:52 --> 00:30:00
zero will have,
at least within the scale of an

340
00:30:00 --> 00:30:08
activation energy, a large
negative value.

341
00:30:08 --> 00:30:12
And let me give you a couple of
examples.  When we talked about

342
00:30:12 --> 00:30:16
carbohydrates,
I briefly told you sucrose was what

343
00:30:16 --> 00:30:20
we call a disaccharide,
two sugars joined together.

344
00:30:20 --> 00:30:24
What do we do when we join two
things together pretty much usually

345
00:30:24 --> 00:30:28
in nature?  You split out
a molecule of water.

346
00:30:28 --> 00:30:33
So we take a molecule of glucose,
a molecule of fructose, both

347
00:30:33 --> 00:30:38
carbohydrates,
stick them together and we get table

348
00:30:38 --> 00:30:43
sugar.  If we want to reverse that
reaction we have to put in a

349
00:30:43 --> 00:30:48
molecule of water and we can run it
the other way.

350
00:30:48 --> 00:30:53
We get glucose plus fructose.
The K equilibrium for that reaction

351
00:30:53 --> 00:30:59
is 140,000.
The delta G prime zero is minus

352
00:30:59 --> 00:31:05
seven kilocalories per mole.
So that's an example of what I was

353
00:31:05 --> 00:31:12
just telling you,
a fairly large negative value.

354
00:31:12 --> 00:31:19
If we think about a reaction that's
not favorable,

355
00:31:19 --> 00:31:26
here's acidic acid.
That's what makes vinegar sour.

356
00:31:26 --> 00:31:33
And the hydrogen ion can come off
here to give you a hydrogen ion and

357
00:31:33 --> 00:31:41
the negative ion of acidic acid or
acetate ion.  The equilibrium

358
00:31:41 --> 00:31:48
constant for that one is,
what is it, I think two times ten to

359
00:31:48 --> 00:31:56
the minus five.
So only a little tiny bit of the

360
00:31:56 --> 00:32:03
acidic acid actually ionizes.
And the K equilibrium constant then,

361
00:32:03 --> 00:32:09
excuse me, the delta G prime zero is
plus 6.3 kilocalories per mole.

362
00:32:09 --> 00:32:16
So buried in this example is not
showing you that a reaction that's

363
00:32:16 --> 00:32:23
unfavorable will have a positive
free energy associated with it,

364
00:32:23 --> 00:32:30
whereas one that's favorable will
have a negative free energy.

365
00:32:30 --> 00:32:35
This is also sort of telling you why
you don't die when you put salad

366
00:32:35 --> 00:32:40
dressing on your salad,
because if acidic acid ionized as

367
00:32:40 --> 00:32:45
thoroughly as sulfuric acid and you
put an equivalent amount of sulfuric

368
00:32:45 --> 00:32:50
acid on our salads none of us would
be here.  It's only a little tiny

369
00:32:50 --> 00:32:56
bit that's going, and so that's
what's happening.

370
00:32:56 --> 00:33:00
So what this really sets us up for
is this fundamental problem in

371
00:33:00 --> 00:33:04
biology, and that is that this
reaction here,

372
00:33:04 --> 00:33:09
you can see what it would go,
this one doesn't go, but most of the

373
00:33:09 --> 00:33:13
reactions that you have to carry out
in biology demand an energy input

374
00:33:13 --> 00:33:17
because they just won't go.
We could sort of force this a

375
00:33:17 --> 00:33:22
little bit.  We could raise the
concentration of the reactions and

376
00:33:22 --> 00:33:26
it would give us a little bit more
product, but that's not a useful

377
00:33:26 --> 00:33:32
solution to all the things.
So this was a really fundamental

378
00:33:32 --> 00:33:38
problem that had to be solved in
evolution in order for life to ever

379
00:33:38 --> 00:33:45
exist.  And I'll give you just an
example.  If we consider taking a

380
00:33:45 --> 00:33:51
couple of molecules of glutamate,
which is one of the amino acids we

381
00:33:51 --> 00:33:57
talked about, a couple of molecules
of amino and making it into a couple

382
00:33:57 --> 00:34:02
of molecules of glutamine.
Now, this is an amino acid needed

383
00:34:02 --> 00:34:05
for making proteins.
This is an amino acid needed for

384
00:34:05 --> 00:34:09
making proteins.
The cell has to have both of them.

385
00:34:09 --> 00:34:19
Glutamate has two methylene groups

386
00:34:19 --> 00:34:25
and then are carboxyl group that's
one of the acid amino acids.

387
00:34:25 --> 00:34:34
And glutamine the side chain --

388
00:34:34 --> 00:34:39
-- is now amid.
The delta G from zero associated

389
00:34:39 --> 00:34:44
with this reaction is plus seven
kilocalories per mole,

390
00:34:44 --> 00:34:49
so it's as unfavorable almost as
that one we're looking at.

391
00:34:49 --> 00:34:54
In fact, it's worse than the one
we're looking at over there.

392
00:34:54 --> 00:34:59
The reason that this is sort of
pushing the thing uphill

393
00:34:59 --> 00:35:04
energetically is that the electrons
here actually distribute themselves

394
00:35:04 --> 00:35:09
back and forth.
So you can kind of think of the

395
00:35:09 --> 00:35:13
molecule as going back and forth
between these two forms.

396
00:35:13 --> 00:35:17
And that makes it more stable.
And when you stick on the amine

397
00:35:17 --> 00:35:22
group to make the amid it cannot do
that, and so you're actually pushing

398
00:35:22 --> 00:35:26
everything energetically uphill.
So how does a cell accomplish this?

399
00:35:26 --> 00:35:32
There's energy available.
If we consider what happens with

400
00:35:32 --> 00:35:40
C6H12O6 going to two lactate the
delta G prime zero associated with

401
00:35:40 --> 00:35:48
that is minus 50 kilocalories per
mole.  So the cell has got a lot of

402
00:35:48 --> 00:35:56
energy out of making even that
simple conversation of a sugar

403
00:35:56 --> 00:36:03
molecule into two lactate.
But it somehow has to figure out how

404
00:36:03 --> 00:36:09
to use that energy in order to drive
these unfavorable reactions.

405
00:36:09 --> 00:36:16
And the solution, which is really
one of the secrets to life,

406
00:36:16 --> 00:36:27
is to use coupled reactions --

407
00:36:27 --> 00:36:34
-- with a common intermediate.

408
00:36:34 --> 00:36:38
And if you look outside a cell,
as Lavoisier did or Pasteur did,

409
00:36:38 --> 00:36:43
this is what you'd see.  But if you
could look inside the cell and see

410
00:36:43 --> 00:36:48
what's happening when that
conversion is being made you'd

411
00:36:48 --> 00:36:53
discover that the full reaction
looks like this.

412
00:36:53 --> 00:36:58
It's the sugar molecule plus two
molecules of ADP plus two molecules

413
00:36:58 --> 00:37:03
of inorganic phosphate are going to
give two molecules of lactate plus

414
00:37:03 --> 00:37:10
two molecules of ATP.
What's ATP?  It's a ribonucleotide.

415
00:37:10 --> 00:37:29
That's ADP.  And what happens when

416
00:37:29 --> 00:37:34
you make ATP is an extra phosphate
gets added onto that end

417
00:37:34 --> 00:37:39
of the molecule.
So by having yet another phosphate

418
00:37:39 --> 00:37:43
on here you've got a whole role of
negative charges.

419
00:37:43 --> 00:37:47
This is a molecule in which the
various parts are not happy to be

420
00:37:47 --> 00:37:51
together because all these negative
charges would like to push apart so

421
00:37:51 --> 00:37:55
when you break the bond of ATP then
energy is released.

422
00:37:55 --> 00:37:59
So using ATP is a way of sort of
storing chemical energy so you can

423
00:37:59 --> 00:38:03
use it in some other
kind of context.

424
00:38:03 --> 00:38:09
And so by burning it,
by carrying out the reaction in this

425
00:38:09 --> 00:38:16
way a cell is able to not only make
a molecule of sugar,

426
00:38:16 --> 00:38:22
glucose into two lactate,
it's able to generate ATP along the

427
00:38:22 --> 00:38:29
way.  And the delta G prime zero for
this reaction is minus 34

428
00:38:29 --> 00:38:35
kilocalories per mole.
So even though it's taking out some

429
00:38:35 --> 00:38:41
of that energy and putting it in ATP,
this is a reaction that goes very,

430
00:38:41 --> 00:38:47
very efficiently.  Then instead of
trying to carry out just that

431
00:38:47 --> 00:38:53
reaction, what the cell is actually
doing is taking the two glutamate

432
00:38:53 --> 00:38:59
plus the two molecules of
ammonia plus two ATP.

433
00:38:59 --> 00:39:05
And then this is converting it to
two glutamine plus two water.

434
00:39:05 --> 00:39:12
I think I failed to put that in
here so you can correct it back

435
00:39:12 --> 00:39:19
there.  Plus two ADP plus two
molecules of inorganic phosphate.

436
00:39:19 --> 00:39:26
And so the Pi very commonly used in
biochemistry to denote just

437
00:39:26 --> 00:39:33
inorganic phosphate ion.
So what's happen here then are these

438
00:39:33 --> 00:39:40
two reactions going on.
This reaction now, because ATP is

439
00:39:40 --> 00:39:47
involved, is now favorable,
and the delta G for this reaction is

440
00:39:47 --> 00:39:54
minus nine kilocalories per mole.
So by having an ATP hydrolyzed as

441
00:39:54 --> 00:40:01
part of the reaction mechanism,
this reaction that used to be

442
00:40:01 --> 00:40:09
unfavorable is now favorable.
And then the kind of cute thing then

443
00:40:09 --> 00:40:17
is if you sum this all up,
the ATPs and the ADPs are on both

444
00:40:17 --> 00:40:25
sides of the equation so they just
drop out.  And what you're left with

445
00:40:25 --> 00:40:33
is C6H12O6 plus the two glutamines
plus two ammonias going to give two

446
00:40:33 --> 00:40:41
glutamines, excuse me,
two lactate plus two glutamines plus

447
00:40:41 --> 00:40:49
the two waters.
And the delta G prime zero for this

448
00:40:49 --> 00:40:57
is minus 43 kilocalories per mole.
So this is not, you can think of it

449
00:40:57 --> 00:41:05
as using energy in the form of ATP
like this a little the way we use

450
00:41:05 --> 00:41:11
money in our society.
I do some work at MIT.

451
00:41:11 --> 00:41:15
I don't get given food to eat or TV
to watch the Super Bowl.

452
00:41:15 --> 00:41:20
Instead I get given money,
then I go to the store, I give them

453
00:41:20 --> 00:41:25
the money, I end up with the food or
the stuff.  And if you're watching

454
00:41:25 --> 00:41:29
it from the outside you see me do
work at school and then food,

455
00:41:29 --> 00:41:34
TV or whatever shows up at home.
But what's happening is the money is

456
00:41:34 --> 00:41:39
serving as a common intermediate in
those transactions.

457
00:41:39 --> 00:41:44
And that's what basically ATP is in
the cell.  It's energy money.

458
00:41:44 --> 00:41:49
And in making ATP the cell has to
take this ribose with an adenine on

459
00:41:49 --> 00:41:54
it, I think I didn't put the adenine
on here I realize.

460
00:41:54 --> 00:42:00
The adenine is sitting on the
ribose now.

461
00:42:00 --> 00:42:03
There are two phosphates,
both of which have a negative charge

462
00:42:03 --> 00:42:07
on them.  And to create that third
bond it has to push it together.

463
00:42:07 --> 00:42:11
It's a very sort of an
intrinsically unstable molecule.

464
00:42:11 --> 00:42:14
When you break the bond it will give
you energy back.

465
00:42:14 --> 00:42:18
And that's one of the really
amazing secretes to life,

466
00:42:18 --> 00:42:22
and that's the underlying principal
of why it is that life can go

467
00:42:22 --> 00:42:26
forward.  Now,
the second issue that we need to

468
00:42:26 --> 00:42:37
quickly address here is --

469
00:42:37 --> 00:42:41
-- not only can a reaction go,
which is what thermodynamics tells

470
00:42:41 --> 00:42:46
us, but how can fast can it go.
And this epitomizes the problem

471
00:42:46 --> 00:42:50
that all chemical reactions face
because literally every chemical

472
00:42:50 --> 00:42:55
reaction that you carry out involves
bringing a couple of

473
00:42:55 --> 00:43:00
entities together.
And as they get closer and closer

474
00:43:00 --> 00:43:05
and closer they don't want to be
there so you have to sort of push

475
00:43:05 --> 00:43:11
them together in some kind of way or
make sure they have enough energy to

476
00:43:11 --> 00:43:16
get together.  And that's what we
see represented here.

477
00:43:16 --> 00:43:21
And that's a special term called
the activation energy.

478
00:43:21 --> 00:43:27
It's given the term delta G with a
double-dagger.  And that is what --

479
00:43:27 --> 00:43:31
It's the size of that activation
energy that limits how fast chemical

480
00:43:31 --> 00:43:35
reactions can go.
So the solution you use in

481
00:43:35 --> 00:43:39
chemistry, most of you,
is you use a catalyst.  And the

482
00:43:39 --> 00:43:43
catalyst doesn't change the outcome
of the reaction.

483
00:43:43 --> 00:43:47
It just changes how fast you get
there.  So there are many reactions

484
00:43:47 --> 00:43:51
you've heard about in chemistry.
Just stick the thing at 500 degrees

485
00:43:51 --> 00:43:55
centigrade, put in a piece of
platinum, and now the reaction will

486
00:43:55 --> 00:43:58
go a whole lot faster.
By heating it up molecules have more

487
00:43:58 --> 00:44:02
energy.  So if they have more energy
they can get closer together just

488
00:44:02 --> 00:44:06
from that.  And then what the
platinum surface would do is allow

489
00:44:06 --> 00:44:10
the molecules to both stick and that
would bring them in proximately and

490
00:44:10 --> 00:44:14
also help them come together.
Well, you cannot raise the

491
00:44:14 --> 00:44:18
temperature in a biological system,
but still you have to overcome this.

492
00:44:18 --> 00:44:22
But the principal then, what you
have to do when you carry out a

493
00:44:22 --> 00:44:26
catalyst, what any catalyst would do
is that it lowers this

494
00:44:26 --> 00:44:41
activation energy.

495
00:44:41 --> 00:44:45
And if you lower the activation
energy then enough of the molecules,

496
00:44:45 --> 00:44:49
just at whatever condition they're
in will have enough energy to be

497
00:44:49 --> 00:44:53
able to go.  It won't change the
size of the drop.

498
00:44:53 --> 00:44:57
It just changes how fast you reach
that final equilibrium.

499
00:44:57 --> 00:45:01
And there are two forms of
biological --

500
00:45:01 --> 00:45:06
Two molecules that are
biological catalysts.

501
00:45:06 --> 00:45:16
One of the molecules you know is

502
00:45:16 --> 00:45:23
enzymes.  Enzymes are made of a
protein.  We spent a bunch of time

503
00:45:23 --> 00:45:29
working at that.
One of the things I showed you the

504
00:45:29 --> 00:45:33
very first day,
this is a thing made by the anthrax

505
00:45:33 --> 00:45:37
bacterium, anthrax lethal factor.
What it actually is, it's a protein

506
00:45:37 --> 00:45:42
and it's an enzyme that's able to
catalyze the cleavage of certain

507
00:45:42 --> 00:45:46
peptide bonds in proteins in our
body.  And in particular it goes

508
00:45:46 --> 00:45:51
after molecules that are involved in
signaling processes inside of cells.

509
00:45:51 --> 00:45:55
And if we don't have those then we
die.  More recently it was

510
00:45:55 --> 00:46:00
discovered that RNA
can be a catalyst.

511
00:46:00 --> 00:46:04
And these are called,
if you have an RNA that's a catalyst

512
00:46:04 --> 00:46:09
it's called a ribozyme.
And these seemed pretty exotic for

513
00:46:09 --> 00:46:13
a little while they first discovered
the idea that a piece of RNA could

514
00:46:13 --> 00:46:18
serve as a catalyst in a biological
system, but it eventually turned out

515
00:46:18 --> 00:46:22
that the ribosome,
which we'll talk about in some

516
00:46:22 --> 00:46:27
detail which is the protein
synthesizing machinery that creates

517
00:46:27 --> 00:46:31
those peptide bonds between each of
the amino acids to make

518
00:46:31 --> 00:46:36
the proteins.
It's a big conglomeration of RNA

519
00:46:36 --> 00:46:40
shown in gray and a bunch of
different proteins that are shown in

520
00:46:40 --> 00:46:45
yellow, but the actual formation of
the peptide bond,

521
00:46:45 --> 00:46:49
the thing that makes all proteins is
actually catalyzed by a piece of RNA.

522
00:46:49 --> 00:46:54
And so the ribosome is actually a
ribozyme.  And it's ironic that that

523
00:46:54 --> 00:46:58
sense that a piece of RNA is
catalyzing the bond that makes

524
00:46:58 --> 00:47:03
proteins possible.
So we'll finish this up and get in

525
00:47:03 --> 00:47:07
then to glycolysis which is the most
evolutionary ancient of these

526
00:47:07 --> 00:47:10
energy-producing systems
on Monday.  OK?
