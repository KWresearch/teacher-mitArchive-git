Transcript â€“ Lecture 14 

There were some other questions sort of running along this general idea of the fact 
that the  information in DNA doesn't go, even though it encodes the information for 
proteins goes via this rRNA intermed iate. Someone asked what was the M. The M is 
for messenger. The  idea being that since the DNA, at least in eukaryotes the DNA 
was in the nucleus and proteins were made out of the cytoplasm, somehow that 
information had to be carried  from the nucleus where the DNA was out to the 
cytoplasm. 

And that's where the term messenger was because the RNA was seen as something 
that would carry the information out. Now, a point here, it's really critical because 
we're going to continue to ta lk about gene regulation. And that is when a cell is 
making one of these mRNAs, it doesn't make one single copy of all of the genes that 
are in the genome on one RNA. Instead it does it either one gene at a time, which is 
the usual case, or occasionally as we see  in the lac operon a little cluster of genes 
that have related functions. 

And the beauty of that is that it then enables the cell to dia l in how much protein is 
being made, in part at least, by determining how much RNA is being made. So you're 
going to make no RNA and not make the protein at all or make a little RNA and get a 
little protein, or if it's really a thing you need very  large quantities of you can rea lly 
crank out a lot of RNA and make a lot of protein. 

So the potentia l is there for regulation. And in bacteria, as I sa id, for almost all 
bacteria l genes it's pretty straightforward. You can look in the DNA, and at least if 
you know where to start, see the start of a protein, you can just use that tab le of the 
genetic code and read off the sequence. But eukaryotes in particular, higher 
eukaryotes have this odd business that what seemed odd and surprising that when 
you look at their genes, many of them you cannot do that because  it's as if there are 
extra b its of DNA stuck in the middle. 

And in some cases you heard it could be really huge amounts of DNA so that there is 
this extra thing where there's a pre-mRNA. And  this RNA splicing we ta lked about 
has to take place to generate the mRNA. And once you have the mRNA then the 
ribosome and the charge tRNAs can be used to make the proteins. And someone 
asked what a ll that extra DNA is for. I mean we still don't fully understand that. 

There are some regulatory sequences and regulatory actors that are buried in that 
non-coding DNA. But another thing may be that this is just the way it's worked  in 
evolution. And as long as it works there's no driving  force necessarily to get rid of it. 
If you look at microorganisms, for example, yeast is a eukaryotic that, like E. coli, 
has to replicate pretty fast in order to compete with other microorganisms for the 
food and whatnot in its environment. 

And it has relatively little of these extra intervening sequences compared to what we 
find in our DNA. I gave you the example of Factor 8. It didn't rea lly particularly 
matter what it was  in the sense that it was just an example of something that has a 

lot of intervening sequence. What it is, though, it's one of a set of proteins that are 
involved in clotting of your blood. When you cut yourself, we have this system that 
prevents us from bleeding to death, unless you have hemophilia or something like 
that where's there's a problem w ith the clotting system, then a very complex set of 
things happen. 

And Factor 8 is one of the several proteins that play critica l roles in that. Somebody 
asked, I talked about a few things that were, this was sort of the dogma. This was 
how information was thought to go. And then how Dave Baltimore found there was 
reverse transcriptase that could take an RNA and make a DNA copy. And the 
question was they d idn't understand how the dogma could change. 

I mean that's sort of what I'm  trying to emphasize a lot in this course  is what I'm 
teaching you is what human experimentation and thought has brought up until 
spring of 2005 in terms in biology. Some of the sort of basic discoveries were made 
in physics so long ago that it's very unlikely that you'll come in and discover that the 
Newtonian mechanics you learned as a freshman is not operative anymore when 
you're a senior, but you can still have these massive revolutions in biology where 
just suddenly whole things, like RNA splicing, emerge from the woodwork almost 
overnight. 

And that's, in fact, what happened with that. That's what happened with reverse 
transcriptase. So, in a sense, it's a lmost a joke that Crick ca lled it dogma. He didn't 
know what he was doing. But it sort of took that property on. And I'm trying to 
caution you that even though some of you would like me to stick to just facts that 
we're continua lly learning and there are d iscoveries being made even as we're going 
on w ith this course. 

Now, I told you that there were certain viruses, HIV being the one I rea lly 
emphasized, that have this property. Their genetic materia l is not DNA. It's RNA. And 
the reverse transcriptase makes a double-strand copy that it inserts  into the 
organism's DNA and becomes a permanent part. And  I'm trying to caution you that's 
why safe sex is such a big dea l. Because if you get infected with HIV you'll have it for 
the rest of your life. 

I mentioned there were some cancer viruses, and someone said, well, if you do  that 
how can you cure cancer? Well, in fact, we're lucky in the sense that we don't have 
to contend at this point in a major way with human cancer viruses, that would be 
more of a prob lem, but your cats have to. You may have heard of the feline leukemia 
virus. This is a  retrovirus of this same class, and cats  infected with it have it in their 
saliva. 

And a lthough it can be transmitted amongst pets in the same household,  the b ig 
problem is usually cat fights. And then you get a scratch and then it gets in. So if 
you have a cat you probably had to take it to the vet and get vaccinated. And one of 
the reasons is you're trying to get it vaccinated against the feline leukemia virus. 
And it's just sort of like that story I told you with the streptococcus, that if your 
immune system has seen the thing beforehand then if you actua lly get an infection it 
has a very quick response and your cat doesn't get infected by the virus. 

And therefore doesn't become a candidate for getting leukemia in later life. OK. So at 
least there's an effort to try and  respond to at least a few of the things. There were 
some very interesting and thoughtful questions. So I want to now go back to ta lk a 

little bit more about this issue of regulation because that is one of the real secrets to 
life. And it's the ab ility of organisms to turn on and off certain functions and to have 
rheostats where they can control the levels of expression. 

But all of this has to be in the DNA. And so before peop le knew how  this worked, it's 
a little mysterious. And maybe one way you might think about it, well, if I have a 
gene that encodes something for lactose metabolism, and I tell you there's a 
sequence upstream of this and somehow this gene is regulated depending on 
whether I put lactose in the medium or not, how is it going to work? Does it have to 
fit  into little holes  in between the letters of the genetic code sort of the way Gamow 
orig ina lly thought about it, or is there some other mechanism? And what you'll see 
here is one of the general strateg ies that evolution has chosen is although there's 
regulatory information in the DNA, DNA isn't a particularly good molecule for 
recogniz ing things, but what it  is good at is encoding proteins. 

So the trick is to have some proteins made whose role  in life are to be regulators. So 
that this is what is underlying this system that I started to  tell you about on Friday. 
So remember -- -- beta-ga lactosidase is the enzyme that takes lactose that is 
galactose beta-1,4 glucose. And somebody said  it's easy to get them mixed up. I 
apologize, but those are the names. And cleaves it, just breaks the bond to g ive 
galactose plus glucose. 

Both of those can be metabolized by ordinary elements you'll find in most cells. But 
taking lactose, which you a lso know as milk sugar because it's in milk, needs this 
extra function. If you're lactose intolerant, as a fraction of you w ill be because that's 
quite common in the human population, then, although you had the enzyme when 
you were baby, it's been shut off in your body since then and it causes problems. 

Because if you eat lactose, drink milk or something, the lactose goes right through 
your stomach and ends up in your intestine. And there are bacteria in there that are 
able to break  it open. And when they do that it leads to gas and some other sort of 
uncomfortab lenesses that are associated w ith  lactose intolerance. So, as I'd said, the 
major finding was that this enzyme beta-ga lactosidase or beta-ga l was regulated. 

That  if you grow E. coli on g lucose -- -- there was no beta-gal. And if you grow them 
on lactose as the carbon source then there were high levels of beta-gal. And that 
then lead Jacques Monod and Francois Jacob, the two French scientists I mentioned, 
to beg in studying this problem. And, like so many things in biology, they were 
working on a huge prob lem, how are genes regulated? But it wasn't so evident at the 
beginning. 

What they were doing was this very modest thing, why is beta-galactosidase there in 
one cond ition and not another? Just a little prob lem in bacterial metabolism. And 
ultimately it gave us the roots to the answer of how genes are regulated. And I just 
have to leave out all the great stuff that led to what they found. Let me just 
recap itulate what I put on the board  the other day. 

It turned out that the lacZ gene, this is the gene that encodes beta-galactosidase, so 
that's the sequence, that has the sequence of codons,  that if you could start at the 
beginning and go a long and just put all the amino acids in you would end up w ith 
beta-ga lactosidase. That unit of genetic information, which is ca lled the lacZ gene, 
let's put it here. Then there were two other genes just downstream of this in the 
DNA. 

And this unit is made as a single mRNA. So this is a little bit d ifferent than what I 
told you. It's not just one gene. It's actua lly two or three because these bacteria try 
to do everything very efficiently because they're growing quickly. This means it can 
turn on three genes of related function very efficiently. When you have several genes 
that are expressed using one mRNA, as I said, the genes are sa id to be organized in 
an operon. 

But the key point that we talked about before  is you're going to have these genes 
expressed everything has to be written in the DNA. And it's not using the genetic 
code. It's using other words that are written there. And you've seen this word now in 
several lectures. That's a promoter. And that means to start transcription. And to 
stop the mRNA there has to be something at the other end. 

And I'll show you the sequence of at least one of these promoters in a minute. This 
means to stop transcription, to stop making the RNA copy. If you d idn't have 
sequences like that the cell wouldn't know where should I beg in the RNA and where 
does it end. And since there are many, many genes, there have to be many 
promoters and many terminators. And the other point I tried to hammer home the 
other day is a lthough the genetic code is universal, you can take that little tab le and 
read the sequence of human proteins or E. 

coli proteins, these other languages that are written using this four-letter nucleic acid 
alphabet are not universal. So the sequences that E. coli uses for a promoter, a start 
transcription are very different than what our bodies use as a start transcription 
thing. And when we get to the recomb inant DNA stuff that will be an issue. So this 
mRNA is then used to make proteins. 

This would be beta-ga lactosidase or the lacZ gene product, and these other genes 
make, so these are proteins. Here you see this flow of information from  the DNA 
through the mRNA down to being made into proteins. In the case of bacteria there's 
no nucleus. Everything is in one big pot so that mRNA doesn't have to go anywhere, 
but it's all there and it gets translated to give copies of the protein. 

So, as I said, somehow if the cell is going to now regulate whether these genes are 
expressed or not, depend ing on whether lactose is present. And the way they do it 
makes perfect sense. Don't bother to make the enzyme if there's no lactose in the 
neighborhood, and only make it if it's present. So how are they going to do that? Is 
the lactose going to come a long and stick into some little hole here or something? 
That's not a genera l strategy and it wouldn't work  if you look at the structure of DNA 
anyway. 

It wouldn't have access to the sequence of bases. So what was discovered was that 
there was another gene very close ca lled lacI. And the protein that it encodes is 
called the lac repressor. And since it's a gene it has to have a promoter, a start 
transcription. But this one, be careful now, don't get yourself mixed up, this is for the 
lacI gene. This is a d ifferent promoter over here for this thing. And then there is also 
then a terminator or a stop transcription. 

And, again, this is for the  lacI gene. So this gets made into an mRNA as well. And 
this gets translated into a protein that's known as lac repressor. And what that lac 
repressor has is the ability to b ind to a particular sequence in DNA that's located 

right here. This is a b ind ing site right here for lac repressor. So let me just try to 
blow that up just a little bit because this could be a  little bit confusing. 

So here's the promoter -- -- for this lacZYA operon. Here's the beginning of the lacZ 
gene. And so this is where the RNA polymerase, the machine that's going to make 
the RNA copy has to bind. And here's the b inding site. -- for lac repressor or the lacI 
protein. So how does this circuit work? And I sort of pose that as an issue for those 
of you who had  followed it at  least to that point. 

So let's consider the two situations. If there's no lactose present what we know from 
just scientists knew from experimentation was there was no beta-ga lactosidase 
activity inside the cell. You could crack them open and you wouldn't find this enzyme 
there. And when you added lactose they knew, from that experiment described on 
Friday, it was synthesized de novo. So if there's no lactose present -- And what 
happens is we have the lacI gene, mRNA is being made, this lac repressor is being 
made, here's the promoter for lacZYA, and here's the sequence. 

And this repressor goes up and binds to that. And by binding to this particular 
sequence what it does is it covers up the promoter. It covers up the start signal, the 
signa l that says "start transcription here". Are you guys with me? It's a relatively 
simple strategy. It's just by lac repressor having that ability to bind to a particular 
sequence it's able to prevent the RNA polymerase from seeing the promoter. 

And therefore it's ab le to prevent the RNA from being made. So there's no mRNA. 
And if there's no mRNA over here then there's no beta-galactosidase being made. 
This is an exercise in futility. Why has the cell gone and made this useless protein 
that isn't doing anything in terms of helping it metabolize lactose? But now take a 
look at the system compared to what I described when we were first doing it. If we 
had to do a ll the regulation directly w ith the DNA we have this problem  that lactose 
would somehow have to be able to see a sequence in DNA and somehow determine 
what happened. 

But what this cell has done now is  it's set this system up so that the ability to make 
lactose or not make  lactose  is cond itiona l on this protein called the lac repressor. If 
lac repressor is bound, as it's shown here, it's basically covering up the promoter, 
the cell cannot make RNA and cannot make beta-galactosidase. If it was absent,  if 
we just got rid of lac repressor then the promoter would be exposed and the cell 
could make beta-ga lactosidase. 

And so  it's now lac repressor that has the cond itiona lity. It's, in essence, a sensor. It 
can at least be considered a sensor for whether lactose is present. And indeed that is 
the property that lac repressor has. It's able to bind lactose. So if we think  lactose  is 
present what happens? I mean this lacI gene is a pretty uninteresting, uninteresting 
from the standpoint of regulation in the sense that it's made a ll the time. 

The cell just continually cranks out a b it of lac repressor. It doesn't need very much. 
It just needs to make enough so that the one binding site for lac repressor has 
somebody bound to it. So it can get away w ith pretty low levels. But over here then 
we have this promoter, and we have the lacZ gene and so on here, and there  is the 
binding sequence right there. But this lac repressor has the ab ility to bind  lactose, 
which I'm going to draw as a little triangle here, even though you know it's a 
disaccharide. 

It has a different property. But the fundamental characteristic of the lac repressor 
binding lactose  is it undergoes a change in confirmation. So if it's got a binding 
pocket, and lactose fits into that b ind ing pocket, those alpha helices and beta sheets 
and so on move around a little bit. And what happens then is it perturbs the part of 
the protein that would normally be ab le to recognize this DNA sequence. 

And this cannot -- -- bind to the DNA sequence up here. And  I'll tell you the special 
name for that bind ing site. It's just one of these terms that you'll see in biology. 
Everything has to be given a name. It's ca lled an operator, for historical reasons. 
But,  in any case, the lac repressor, once it's hanging onto a lactose it's unab le to 
bind this sequence. That means that the start site for transcription is made. 

And so you get the mRNA made and then you get beta-galactosidase present. A little 
bit complicated, but sort of underlying it is this idea that now the cell is using a 
protein rather than DNA to tell whether lactose  is present. And hopefully you can see 
this is really general now because you can design a regulatory protein. And basically 
it's got to have two things. 

It's got to have a part that ta lks to the DNA and recognizes some sequence, and it's 
got to have another part that senses whatever it is. Histidine, temperature, you 
name it. But once you understand that design principle then you can begin to see 
how it is that the cell is able to turn genes on and off just by encoding  information in 
the DNA. And, as I say, one of the big tricks there is to let the protein do the sensing 
for you. 

Now, I just want to give you a little bit of a b lowup of what this things looks like. 
Because sort of all I've done is kind of put it here as a sequence. I've ca lled it a 
promoter. What a promoter then is, again it means the start for transcription, the 
process of making RNA. And I've tried to stress that these promoters are not 
universa l. So when I tell you this for E. 

coli, this is what a promoter for E. coli looks like, but it doesn't look at a ll like a 
promoter in our bod ies. And so it's basica lly a word that's written using this nucleic 
acid alphabet. And it looks something like this. There's TTGACA and then there are 
about 17 base pa irs that can be just about anything. And then there's TATAAT. And 
then there's another little bit here that's about ten base pairs long. 

And then this is the start of the mRNA which is usua lly given the convention of being 
called the p lus one position. So you'll notice this word I've called it, written, that says 
start transcription has even got two parts to it. And this is usua lly referred to the 
minus ten region of the promoter, and this is the minus 35 region because that's the 
distance from the start of transcription. It may seem sort of weird to you to see what 
I'm telling you is sort of a word written in the nucleic acid language. 

It's got some bits in the middle that don't matter. But remember the DNA is a helix 
and things going around like this. So if you were just to take a DNA helix and then 
lay something down on one side of  it, it would contact it here, it wouldn't contact it 
there, and then when it came back up again it would contact it here. And so as these 
things hang on along the sides of DNA it's not at all uncommon to find this sort of 
broken where you can have something that matters, something that doesn't matter 
and something that matters again. 

The RNA polymerase in E. coli, it's a machine. It's got four proteins that are the core. 
That's the part that actua lly synthesizes the RNA p lus one protein, which is known as 
the sigma subunit. And it has the specia l job of recognizing the promoter. And so 
when we start asking where does this regulatory sequence that the lac repressor 
binds it in all of this. 

It turns out that the sequence for b inding lac repressor -- -- overlaps with this minus 
ten region. So when the lac repressor is sitting down it's covering up a very 
important part of transcription. You guys with me? OK. So this is an interesting kind 
of regulation. It's given the general term -- -- negative regulation. And the reason 
that term is applied, it means that the regulatory protein -- -- interferes w ith 
transcription. 

And let's take a brief foray into we're going to ta lk about genetics as our next 
subject. And I think maybe we can let you sort of already get a sense of how some 
of this was figured out. So there's a substance called X-gal, which is a galactose w ith 
some chemical entity hanging off that's colorless. But yet it's a substrate whose bond 
can be cleaved by beta-galactosidase. 

And it gives ga lactose p lus the free X entity. And this is colored. And this is a very 
useful thing for bacterial geneticists. Someone said they thought this was too much 
lab stuff, but I think  if you don't have some sense of how  this is done experimenta lly 
I'm not doing too good a job of conveying to you how we learn all this kind of thing. 
It just doesn't come out of a textbook. 

And so  if we grow E. coli on plates that have g lucose p lus X-gal, the colonies would 
be colorless. And if we were to grow them on p lates that had lactose p lus X-gal then 
all of the colonies would be colored because they're making beta-galactosidase. And 
part of the way that this stuff that I've been telling you was figured out was by 
bacteria l geneticists looking for something. What they looked  for was back here on 
this plate that had Xga l. 

Almost all the colonies were colorless. These were colored because they could make 
beta-ga lactosidase. So if I gave you some plates of this, you looked in the lab and 
then you found a colored colony, it's a mutant. I'll define these terms for you very 
shortly. But it's got an a lteration in the DNA that affects the regulation -- -- of beta-
gal or the product of the lacC gene. And on the basis of what I've told you about this 
model, can you guys come up with two types of things, two p laces or kinds of 
mutations that could break this system that would lead to beta-ga lactosidase being 
on even though there's no lactose in the medium? Anybody see one of them? Why is 
it off? Because of lac repressor? In a wild type stra in it's because  lac repressor is 
bound to that sequence and it's shutting off transcription. 

So we had a variant that could now transcribe. Yeah. OK, so that's a good idea. So if 
we could somehow mutate that little b inding sequence in a way that didn't screw up 
everything else then, even though there was  lac repressor being made, if it couldn't 
bind here because the sequence had been changed then you'd get it made. That's 
exactly right. That's one of them. 

Yeah. OK,  it was a problem making lacI. What would happen? Well, if we couldn't 
make this and it couldn't bind there we'd be on. And that's the other class. Can you 
think of a kind of mutation that we learned about, think back to the genetic code, 
that would prevent  lac repressor from being made? I'm trying to give you a clue. 

There were 61 codons encoded for amino acids. Yeah. Oh, that would work. Yup, if 
we messed up the promoter. 

That's a sophisticated answer. Yeah, if we messed up the promoter for making lacI 
that would certa inly give that. Can you think of another type of thing that would 
affect the  lacI gene, would prevent lacI from being made? Somebody? Yeah. OK. If 
the sequence was wrong so that they could bind, that would be good. The one I'm 
trying to tease out of you, but I won't take longer now, is remember those three stop 
codons that didn't encode for anything? There should be one of those at the end of 
the protein. 

But if you changed one of the amino acid codons into a stop codon that would also 
prevent you from making it. So there are at  least a couple of kinds of mutations. And 
what I've sort of done here is I've skipped all the evidence and given you the model. 
And I cannot g ive you all the evidence that lead  to this, which is a pretty well-
established model. I don't think this is going to change likely. 

We've been studying it for so long. But this is the kind of evidence on which it was 
based. In was by people finding things and  figuring out that parts of the machinery 
were broken and then working on. So there's another kind of regulation known as 
positive regulation. And for a long time people though maybe everything was 
negative regulation. But it turns out positive regulation is far more common. 

In this case, the regulatory protein instead of inhibiting transcription assists with the 
transcription. And it turned out, after people had been studying the beta-
galactosidase system for a number of years, that it had a positive control system 
superimposed or together w ith the negative regulatory system. The same thing 
eng ineers do all the time, p ile up regulatory circuits and get a ll kinds of add itiona l 
cond itiona lities. 

And the thing I've told you so  far was we asked whether beta-gal is present. And the 
carbon source -- -- is glucose. This is low or not there. If it's lactose it's high, but if 
cells were grown on both, g lucose plus  lactose, then beta-ga lactosidase is low again. 
And this makes some physiolog ical sense because E. coli likes to use g lucose. It's its 
favorite food source. And so if it's got its favorite food source around then it doesn't 
want to make proteins that are used to eat all its sort of less favorite food source. 

So there's a nice cond itionality here. In order for it, the circuitry is set up so that it 
only makes the enzyme for metabolizing lactose when the cell realizes its favorite 
food source  isn't there and then it senses there's lactose. So only under those 
cond itions does it make the enzymes for making lactose. And, aga in, the way this 
circuitry works, this positive regulation needs two things. Once aga in, it needs a 
protein. 

This one has given the name CRP. And, again, it's something that's able to bind to a 
sequence in DNA. And then it's also got a conditionality. It's able to recognize 
something else. And what this one recognizes  is this sma ll molecule that's known on 
cyclic AMP. It's just the familiar ribomonophosphate that you've seen before but it's 
looped around and formed an ester bond here. And that's why it's called cyclic AMP. 
But the important thing about this is that the levels of cyclic AMP are dependant on 
glucose. 

So if you have high g lucose you have low cyclic AMP and if you have low glucose you 
have high cyclic AMP. And here again is what's going to happen. So this is the 
promoter for lacZYA and here's the start of the lacZ gene. And I told you this is 
where the operator would be binding. This CRP protein is ab le to bind to -- -- a site 
that's even a little b it farther upstream of the lacZ gene than is the promoter. 

And the idea of this is that if this CRP lacks -- -- just by itself, it doesn't b ind to the 
DNA. But it has a little binding pocket that senses the levels of cyclic AMP. So if the 
cell is starving for g lucose, there are high  levels of cyclic AMP, then the CRP bound to 
cyclic AMP, this is capable of b inding to this sequence. So that sounds weird, but 
what we've, again, got now is we've got a protein whose binding to DNA is 
cond itiona l to something inside the cell. 

And rather than getting  in the way, what this does, if you have a situation where you 
have CRP w ith cyclic AMP bond to it and it's next door to this promoter, what  it's able 
to do is help RNA polymerase recognize the promoter. So this helps RNA polymerase. 
Whereas, when we were talking about the lac repressor what it was doing, if you 
reca ll, was getting in the way of RNA polymerase. And this actua lly has a relatively 
simple sort of molecular exp lanation for what's going on. 

The RNA polymerase -- The best sequence for the minus ten region of the promoter, 
that I showed you over on the other board, is something with the sequence TATAAT. 
So the RNA polymerase machinery, it can recognize more than one sequence, but if 
it sees a promoter that has a minus ten reg ion that is TATAAT, it really binds well 
and that would be a very strong promoter and you get  lots of mRNA. Now, the lacZ 
promoter actually has two nucleotides that are d ifferent. 

It's TATGTT. So this is a very weak promoter without help. So in this lac system, if 
we got rid of lac repressor entirely so that the promoter was just exposed a ll the 
time, as I showed you up here, I've left out a detail in this first part in that this 
promoter is not very strong. And we'd only get a little b it of RNA and a little bit of 
protein. 

And so what the cell does is  if it knows there is no ga lactose, knows there's no 
glucose around and cyclic AMP levels are high then it uses the binding of the CRP to 
here to assist the RNA polymerase and get on. I understand this is a bit complicated. 
Some of you probab ly have it. Some of you w ill be lost and you'll have to sit and look 
at your textbook for a little while. But it comes down to a couple of really simple 
principles. 

One is to detect what's going on the cell makes a regulatory protein, the regulatory 
protein binds DNA and it also senses something. And  these things can work in two 
ways. They can either b ind DNA and get in the way, they can be a negative 
regulatory element, or they can b ind to DNA and they can help something happen 
and be a positive regulatory element. 

All the rest are just the details of lac. And we could spend the entire course on 
regulation and barely scratch the surface, but it's one of the huge secrets of life that 
cells are able to individually turn on different genes in different ways at different 
times, have rheostats for levels, coord inate great sets of genes in response to 
various stimuli. Okay? See you on Wednesday.
