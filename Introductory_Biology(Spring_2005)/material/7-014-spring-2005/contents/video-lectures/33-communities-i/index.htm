<p></p>
<p>So, today we're going to continue with our series of lectures to come  to a conclusion from the section on population and community ecology.  At last time, or three lectures ago, we were talking about the  regulation of population growth. And this time, we're going to move  into, just wanted to make sure the boards are in order, community  ecology. And as I said of the first lecture, this is one of the most  difficult branches of the ecological sciences to really describe because  an ecological community is a bit of an abstract concept. And one  definition is that it's a collection of species that are linked together  by their feeding relationships.</p>
<p>OK, so it's sort of like the  ecosystem without the biogeochemistry in a sense. So really what we're  looking at here is the interaction between species in a localized area  with respect to how they influence each other's fitness, in a sense. And  these interrelationships between these species govern all of the things  that we talked about in the first half of my lectures set. It's these  interactions that shape the biogeochemistry of those systems. So, this  is the structure of the system and the biogeochemistry is the function  of the system. And it's also these interactions. So, they affect the  flow of energy, which we talked about.</p>
<p>They affect the cycling of  elements. They affect the evolution, the very evolution of species  within the community. And these communities self assemble. In other  words, if you start with an empty plot of bare land, we talked about  this. Remember the example of the glacier retreating and showing the  succession of species as the glacier retreated? We started with a bare  rock, and you'll start getting lichen growing on the rock. And then that  lichen will create a little bit of soil, allowing plants to come in,  and that the plants increase productivity.</p>
<p>Some of them bring  nitrogen and, allowing shrubs and trees and everything. And that's the  self-assembly of the community. Once you have plant there, you can have  insects there. Once you have insects there, you have birds there. It  self assembles. And one of the questions that ecologists ask is, how  deterministic is that? I mean, we know there are some random components  to it, and we know that there are some things that will happen because  we see it happen over, and over, and over.</p>
<p>So the big question is  what must happen? What could happen? And what might not ever happen?  That's really one of the challenges of ecologists is to understand those  assembly rules of community if there are any. Now, we're not going to  really get into that. We are just going to start looking at the real  fundamentals of community [SOUND OFF/THEN ON] which is, what are the  possible interactions between species that shape evolution? OK. Species  interactions: so, when we talk about species interactions and how they  structure communities, we have to first define some terms.</p>
<p>One is  Darwinian fitness. And the fitness of an individual is the relative  ability of an individual in a population to survive and reproduce. So,  it's all relative, OK, within a population. And we're going to define  also, we'll be talking about adaptations, and I know you know what this  is, but let's just make sure that we are all operating with the same  assumption. And an adaptation, which is something that affects the  fitness, is a heritable trait that increases the fitness of an  individual with respect to other individuals in that population.</p>
<p>So,  these are just some operating assumptions so that when we talk about  species interactions, there are several possibilities. If we have  organism one and organism two, we can have, and we ask how does the  presence of organism two and the presence of organism one affect the  fitness of the two organisms? And if the fitness of both organisms is  increased by being in the presence of the other, that's called  mutualism. Being together increases the fitness of both relative to when  they're alone.</p>
<p>If being together decreases the fitness of both,  that's called competition. And if you have the situation, what we recall  that? It could be parasitism, yeah, parasitism. What else? Was the  ultimate form of reduced fitness? Predation, yeah, being dead is the  ultimate reduced fitness. So, parasitism and predation. And then there  are some other sort of rather vague interactions where when you put two  individuals together, the fitness of one is not influenced but the  fitness of the other is either influenced positively or negatively, and  we're not going to talk about those.</p>
<p>But this one's called  commencalism. And this one's called amensalism. And obviously there are  gradients. Actually, an example of commencalism is something that we've  talked about. Can anybody think about what that is when we talked about  food webs? It's kind of a stretch, but detritivory. An organism eating  detritus, in a sense, is commencalism because it doesn't affect the  fitness of the dead individual because it's already dead.</p>
<p>So, that  gets to not having that much meaning. So anyway, these we are not going  to spend time on, but they are forms of interaction that do exist. And  there are gradients between these. Obviously, it's not all black and  white. So, we're going to start by talking about competition. And just  to remind you, competition comes in two forms. There is intraspecific  competition, which means within a species, OK? And that's not what we're  going to be talking about today, but we've already talked about this  without explicitly, remember our logistic equation and the density  dependent feedback mechanisms in that population that caused the  population to deviate from exponential growth was due to intraspecific  competition: individuals within a species competing with each other for  resources.</p>
<p>We are going to talking about now is more interspecific  -- -- which is competition between species, OK? So, I want to show you  some slides that are just from your textbook, but just to get you in the  mood for competition. So, it comes in all different forms, and I don't  care whether you know the names of these. It doesn't matter. This is  just to give you an idea of the different types of competition that we  see in nature. This is what's called consumptive competition, and this  is just showing the roots of the trees competing for nutrients in the  soil. Preemptive competition shows these are barnacles. We're going to  talk a little bit more about that later, just totally taking over the  substrate.</p>
<p>So no other organism could possibly settle there.  Overgrowth competition in plants where this plant would be shading, so  other plants that require a lot of light could not grow underneath.  Chemical competition also occurs where one plant will actually excrete  certain chemicals that create these corridors of no growth around them  so other plants can't get near to compete for the nutrients. The classic  form of competition, say, in birds and a lot of higher organisms is  competition for territory.</p>
<p>So these are displays so that an  individual can keep a certain territory, and therefore make that food  available to itself, therefore increasing its fitness because it's able  to feed its young. And then this is sort of the classic, really tooth  and claw competition where encounter competition where all these species  are competing over this zebra carcass, hyena, vultures, etc. OK, now  before we can talk more and more in detail about competition, we need to  define the ecological niche. And this is an interesting concept in  ecology that has been around for quite some time, and it kind of went  out of popularity for a while.</p>
<p>And I was gratified to see that  it's made it back into the introductory biology textbooks because I  think it's a very profound concept. In this particular competition, the  fundamental ecological niche comes from G. Evelyn Hutchinson, who is one  of the founders of modern ecology. He defined as the fundamental niche  of an organism as an N-dimensional hypervolume, every point on which a  species can survive and reproduce indefinitely in the absence of other  species, OK? So, this is an abstract concept, because those species are  rarely in the absence of other species, except maybe in a test tube.</p>
<p>But  it defines the, and also we can't even think about N-dimensions, right?  We're able to think about, we can envision three dimensions. But what  he's talking about here, is every single dimension in the environment  that would have any effect on the fitness of an organism. So here, just  to wrap our brains around this, we're looking at three dimensions.</p>
<p>Our  organisms here is a ladybug, and this would be food size. These guys  eat little aphids and things. I don't know if you've ever used them  under house plants, but it's a good way to keep aphids off your house  plants if you want to introduce ladybugs to your dorm room, which maybe  you don't. But there's a certain range of size, food size, that they can  eat. And so, that's three dimensions.</p>
<p>There are undoubtedly many  other dimensions that we don't even know about, elements that they  require, etc. So, this would be everywhere, in this space is a space  where this organism could survive and reproduce indefinitely. And the  reason this concept lost favor is its something you could never ever  measure this because we can't know the N-dimensions. Well, you can never  say you can't know anything, but it's very difficult to say you could  know all the dimensions that influence the fitness of an organism. But  it's still a very important concept for thinking about it. And the niche  is not a physical place, OK? The niche of an organism is not a physical  place. In an N-dimensional hypervolume.</p>
<p>It's an abstract concept.  So this is the fundamental niche, and here's another closely related  species whose niche has some overlap with this one, but has different  ranges for temperature, humidity, and food size. And when you have  overlapping niches is when you have the possibility, the potential, for  competition. And two things can happen. If they overlap a lot, than  those two species cannot coexist in the same environment. One will  outcompete the other, and it will move on to some other place where it  doesn't have a strong competitor. But if they overlap a little, you can  actually have competitive coexistence. And we're going to talk about the  results of these degrees of niche overlap as we go on in the lecture.  So, if the species can makes it realized, so this is its fundamental  niche, this one's fundamental niche, and what happens if it can make its  realized niche small enough so that there's no niche overlap, then you  can have coexistence of those two species, or very little niche overlap  in the same environment.</p>
<p>So that's the difference between the  fundamental and the realized niche. I think this is from your textbook.  This is just one dimension, seed sized, for, say, a bird eating seeds of  this size range. We'll be talking about birds a lot in this. And here's  partial niche overlap, species to where they eat some seeds of the same  size, but by and large the mode is different. You can have species  coexisting.</p>
<p>Partial niche overlap can lead to competitive  coexistence. And here's the complete overlap in just this one dimension,  which would lead to competitive exclusion. But obviously it matters  what's happening on all the dimensions. This is just an  oversimplification, to give you the idea. OK, so before we go to that, I  want to talk about the classic experiment that led to this, they're  going to put this screen up. Screen, screen, screen, screen. Can you  see, or do I need to turn the lights on? Thank you.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I  always ask my questions that way, where there's no possible answer.  There were some classic competition experiments that's carried out by  Gause way back in 1934 -- -- that I'm just going to use to illustrate  the concept of competitive exclusion, because these were done with very  simple protozoa in a test tube, paramecia, and actually this was back in  the days when they were developing these theories for population  growth. And these organisms were growing according to the logistic  equation. So here we are with, and this is the classic experiment  actually in your textbook that they talk about in the context of the  ecological niche.</p>
<p>So this is Paramecia caudatum. These names  aren't important. Don't worry about it, but we have to call them  something. P. aurelia, which, when grown alone in a test tube grow  according to the logistic equation, they grow up and then they level off  at a certain level. And what Gause did is that he wanted to see, look  at this phenomenon of competition and he grew them together, and he  found that, actually that no matter what combination he put in, aurelia  would always win out in competitive exclusion.</p>
<p>And he learned  through a series of experiments, we don't have time to go into the  details, but this would always occur if you made two species compete in a  very simple environment. In the test tube where he was feeding these  guys exactly the same food, some form of bacteria, in a test tube this  one would always outcompete the other, and there would be competitive  exclusion.</p>
<p>If he made the environment more complex, where there  were layers in it, or there was sediment in the bottom of the test tube,  that allowed more niche dimensions. There were conditions under which  the competitive coexistence would be allowed. And he actually developed a  set of equations to describe his competition that I'm going to write  for you. We're not going to use them; we're not going to analyze them in  detail, but I'm just going to show them to you so that you have an  appreciation for how population ecologists and community ecologists  start to think about these systems. So, he said we can model this  interaction using our logistic equation.</p>
<p>So he said dN/dt would be  the growth rate of, let's call, the top one, one. It doesn't matter  what you call which. The dN/dt equals r1, N1. Now here's our logistic,  K1 minus N1 over K. But he said I'm going to modify this equation so  that the actual growth of the organism is reduced to some amount that's  proportional to the number of the other organisms that are there. So, he  called that alpha-N2. OK, so some amount that's proportional to amount  the other species that's here.</p>
<p>And then, he said dN2/DT is equal  to r2, N2, K2 minus N2 minus beta-N1 over, this should be K1, over K2.  So, the growth rate of species to in the presence of species one is  reduced by some amount that's proportional to the abundance of species  one. And these, the values of these, these are called competition  coefficients. You can actually do experiments and put values on these,  and they are a measure of how strong a competitor each of these species  are with respect to the other one. So, you're not going to have to deal  with these, but I just wanted you to see them, and see how population  ecologists began to model these systems.</p>
<p>And so, it's the relative  values of these relative to the carrying capacities that will  ultimately determine whether species will coexist or not when they are  competing. OK, so that's more of a theoretical analysis. Now let's look  at the real world. Competitive exclusion, that is, the exclusion of one  species from an environment because of strong competition in another, is  very difficult to study, because if it's not there, you don't know it  was excluded, right? I mean, you don't go to some place and say I don't  see the species here. It must have been eliminated by competitive  exclusion.</p>
<p>It might never have been there. So, the way we learn  about this phenomenon is either through inadvertent experiments, and  that is the introduction of species to new environments and then see  what happens, or actual intentional ecological experiments. So, we're  going to talk about both of those. And the first one -- -- we'll talk  about invasions -- -- and competitive exclusion.</p>
<p>And one of the  classic examples of this is the zebra mussel. I don't know what  happened. Oh, there it is. I didn't realize this was animated. That's  why there was nothing there. So, the zebra mussel is a tiny mussel that  was introduced to the United States back in, I guess, 1988. And up here,  introduced into the Great Lakes by ships just being attached to ships,  or it's possible it might have been the larvae in ships' ballasts. Ships  go into port, they take on water into their ballasts to stabilize, and  then they go to another port and let it out. And they're filled with  larvae and species. So, the entire world oceans are now filled with  introduced species from ships ballasts.</p>
<p>So here's 1988. The zebra  mussel is there. 1990: here. 92: here. 94, 90 whatever, oh, 2001. It  spread amazingly fast. And it is this tiny little mussel that seems to  thrive everywhere: clogs, all kinds of pipes, settles on top of other  native shellfish and kills them, and has led to extensive competitive  exclusion of native shellfish in a number of ecosystems. Some of the  effects of these: in some ecosystems they cleared up the water. They are  able to filter just an amazing amount of water when they're feeding.</p>
<p>So  they actually have increased the clarity of the water in many  ecosystems, filtering out plankton, which allows the light to penetrate  deeper in those systems, allowing aquatic plants to grow from the  bottom. So the introduction of this one species can completely change  the structure of the entire ecosystem. I just heard a lecture.</p>
<p>I  was just visiting the Institute for Ecosystem Studies which is out in  Millbrook, NY. By the way, if any of you are looking for summer  internships and are interested in ecology, they have a fabulous summer  internship program. I've had several students go there that have had  great experiences. But there's somebody there studying the zebra mussel  invasion in the Hudson River. And he showed this incredibly depressing  graph of over the last ten years of the native mussels in that river  going down to basically extinction.</p>
<p>And then, this is the weird  thing about ecosystems, just last year it started to turn around. And  they haven't done anything to eradicate the zebra mussels, but the  native mussels are starting to have a comeback. And nobody knows why,  and nobody knows whether it's a real comeback because it could come back  for a couple of years. So, it's really interesting how unpredictable  these complex systems are.</p>
<p>But these mussels can cause millions  and millions of dollars of damage. And I also learned on that trip that  ecologists are trying to get in place policies that if an industry for  whatever reasons wants to intentionally introduce, Here's an example of  an application of fundamental ecological knowledge. The reason people  study the ecology of invasive species, understanding this competitive  exclusion and all that, is that you want to use that understanding to be  able to predict, if you introduce a new species to a new habitat,  whether it will be invasive or not, there are some species you can  introduce and they will fit right in and not exclude every other  species. And so, what they're trying to put in place is insurance that a  company would have to buy that was either intentionally introducing a  species, or whatever practice that they were doing was likely to  introduce a species, and the cost of that insurance would be a function  of the probability of that species actually causing competitive  exclusion.</p>
<p>And this is something that people are trying to put  into place in to the economic system basically. So, it puts a new  meaning to limited liability company, LLC. So, you have to insure your  liability, which I think would go a long way to reduce some of these  ecological crises. OK, so that's an inadvertent experiment.</p>
<p>Now  there are many, many examples of this. There's books written on invasive  species. And if I can get this thing to work, I'll show you some clips  of invasive species, snakes. And the biggest impact is on islands  because islands have been isolated ecosystems for so long that if you  introduce a species, you have dramatic changes. In Australia, a big  example was a prickly pear cactus which was introduced many years ago to  create living fences for livestock. They completely took over not all  of the grasslands, but a lot of the grasslands and turn them into  thickets.</p>
<p>OK, so invasive species are inadvertent ecological  experiments. Let's talk about intentional experiments. And this is also  very classic textbook experiment that was one of the first ecological  experiments to be done. And it was done with barnacles. This was Joseph  Connell was a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  Barnacles have a larval stage that floats around in the plankton, and  then they settle on rocks. So this was a classic barnacle ecosystem in  Scotland, actually, in which the upper inner tidal there is a species  called Chthamalus. And then the lower was dominated by a species of  mussel called Balanus.</p>
<p>So, he asked the question, is this  distribution where the two are exclusive of one another, is it due to  competition between them, or is it just that this one tolerates  desiccation longer than this one? The inner tidal zone, the tide goes up  and down, so this one's going to be exposed to dryness a lot longer.  So, how do you answer that question? Well, you do an experiment and so  what he did was he took rocks from the upper, inner tidal that had the  Chthamalus on them, and he moved them to the lower one. And he let the  Balanus, the species that dominates down here colonize on those rocks.  But then he divided them in half, and removed the Balanus from half of  the rock. And then he monitored the survivorship of the Chthamalus.</p>
<p>And  remember the survivorship curves that we talked about when we created  those life tables, he actually measured survivorship curves on these. If  you go to the original paper, you see LX is a function of time. So  that's a tool that we use, to ask the question, is the survivorship of  Chthamalus increased in the absence of Balanus? And this is all from  your textbook, showing that the percent of mortality, when a competitor  is present is much higher than the competitor is absent.</p>
<p>So, he's  able to show directly that there was competition between the two. And in  fact, this was that kind of aggressive kind of competition where one  just plucks the other one off the rock. I mean it's direct: you're on my  rock; get out of here, and it pops it off. He also was able to show  that tolerance to desiccation is also a factor in this system.</p>
<p>It's  not like it's totally competition. But competition was playing a role,  and so I've summarized that in this slide using our terminology. He was  able to show that the fundamental niche of Chthamalus, in other words --  -- the region in the inner tidal, where the larvae could actually  settle and live in the absence of competitors was much broader than the  realized niche. All right, so let's get this over. This is from your  textbook.</p>
<p>And we're going to just use, I'm going to use an example  of that. So, competition can also lead to character displacement -- --  which in turn can lead to actual competitive coexistence. And an example  of this, we're going to talk about Darwin's finches in the Galapagos  Islands. And one of the ways that ecologists actually measure, that's a  bird, in case you didn't notice it. And this is beak depth. The shape  and size of a beak tells you what kinds of seeds a bird can eat, and so  they measured beak depth as a niche dimension, basically, because it  tells you what size seeds the bird can eat.</p>
<p>And a study was done;  we're going to make the islands here. What is going to call them A, B,  C, D; these are islands. And there are two species of finches, which we  are just going to call F. Well, they're fuliginosa. Again, the name's  not important, and the other one is called fortis. So, we'll just call  them, on islands that have both of them, and there are some islands that  have only one.</p>
<p>So, what was done is they measure the beak depth  of the different finches on the islands where they were found together  versus islands where they were found alone in the Galapagos Islands. And  what they found, and this has been shown for many, many different  studies. You look at the beak depth distribution. This is percent in  size class.</p>
<p>And this is island C, D, and A, and B. And they found  that when the species were on islands where they lived alone, they had  almost complete niche, oh this is beak depth. They had exactly the same  size beak distributions. In other words, they were feeding on the same  food. And on the islands where they were together, A and B, I'm just  making sure this actually holds together, they found what is called  character displacement, and that is that the birds that had longer beaks  and smaller beaks, were preferentially selected for such that reducing  the amount of niche overlap. So, and this leads to competitive  coexistence.</p>
<p>OK, and that's what we're looking at here. This is  from your textbooks. This is from African seed crackers showing that  birds with smaller bills consume soft seeds more efficiently. Birds with  larger bills crack hard seeds, and you can see that the width of the  bill here is different.</p>
