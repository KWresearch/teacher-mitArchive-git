1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:07
So, today we're going to continue
with our series of lectures to come

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:14
to a conclusion from the section on
population and community ecology.

3
00:00:14 --> 00:00:22
At last time, or three lectures ago,
we were talking about the regulation

4
00:00:22 --> 00:00:30
of population growth.
And this time,

5
00:00:30 --> 00:00:38
we're going to move into,
just wanted to make sure the boards

6
00:00:38 --> 00:00:46
are in order, community ecology.
And as I said of the first lecture,

7
00:00:46 --> 00:00:54
this is one of the most difficult
branches of the ecological sciences

8
00:00:54 --> 00:01:02
to really describe because an
ecological community is a bit of an

9
00:01:02 --> 00:01:11
abstract concept.
And one definition is that it's a

10
00:01:11 --> 00:01:23
collection of species that are
linked together by their

11
00:01:23 --> 00:01:39
feeding relationships.

12
00:01:39 --> 00:01:45
OK, so it's sort of like the
ecosystem without the

13
00:01:45 --> 00:01:51
biogeochemistry in a sense.
So really what we're looking at

14
00:01:51 --> 00:01:57
here is the interaction between
species in a localized area with

15
00:01:57 --> 00:02:04
respect to how they influence each
other's fitness, in a sense.

16
00:02:04 --> 00:02:09
And these interrelationships between
these species govern all of the

17
00:02:09 --> 00:02:14
things that we talked about in the
first half of my lectures set.

18
00:02:14 --> 00:02:19
It's these interactions that shape
the biogeochemistry of those systems.

19
00:02:19 --> 00:02:24
So, this is the structure of the
system and the biogeochemistry is

20
00:02:24 --> 00:02:30
the function of the system.
And it's also these interactions.

21
00:02:30 --> 00:02:40
So, they affect the flow of energy,
which we talked about.  They affect

22
00:02:40 --> 00:02:50
the cycling of elements.
They affect the evolution,

23
00:02:50 --> 00:03:00
the very evolution of species within
the community.

24
00:03:00 --> 00:03:06
And these communities self assemble.
In other words, if you start with

25
00:03:06 --> 00:03:12
an empty plot of bare land,
we talked about this.  Remember the

26
00:03:12 --> 00:03:18
example of the glacier retreating
and showing the succession of

27
00:03:18 --> 00:03:24
species as the glacier retreated?
We started with a bare rock, and

28
00:03:24 --> 00:03:31
you'll start getting lichen
growing on the rock.

29
00:03:31 --> 00:03:35
And then that lichen will create a
little bit of soil,

30
00:03:35 --> 00:03:39
allowing plants to come in,
and that the plants increase

31
00:03:39 --> 00:03:43
productivity.  Some of them bring
nitrogen and, allowing shrubs and

32
00:03:43 --> 00:03:47
trees and everything.
And that's the self-assembly of the

33
00:03:47 --> 00:03:51
community.  Once you have plant
there, you can have insects there.

34
00:03:51 --> 00:03:55
Once you have insects there, you
have birds there.

35
00:03:55 --> 00:03:59
It self assembles.
And one of the questions that

36
00:03:59 --> 00:04:03
ecologists ask is, how deterministic
is that?

37
00:04:03 --> 00:04:08
I mean, we know there are some
random components to it,

38
00:04:08 --> 00:04:13
and we know that there are some
things that will happen because we

39
00:04:13 --> 00:04:18
see it happen over,
and over, and over.  So the big

40
00:04:18 --> 00:04:24
question is what must happen?
What could happen?  And what might

41
00:04:24 --> 00:04:29
not ever happen?
That's really one of the challenges

42
00:04:29 --> 00:04:35
of ecologists is to understand those
assembly rules

43
00:04:35 --> 00:04:39
of community if there are any.
Now, we're not going to really get

44
00:04:39 --> 00:04:44
into that.  We are just going to
start looking at the real

45
00:04:44 --> 00:04:49
fundamentals of community [SOUND
OFF/THEN ON] which is,

46
00:04:49 --> 00:04:54
what are the possible interactions
between species that shape

47
00:04:54 --> 00:05:07
evolution?  OK.

48
00:05:07 --> 00:05:13
Species interactions: so,
when we talk about species

49
00:05:13 --> 00:05:20
interactions and how they structure
communities, we have to first define

50
00:05:20 --> 00:05:27
some terms.  One is
Darwinian fitness.

51
00:05:27 --> 00:05:43
And the fitness of an individual is

52
00:05:43 --> 00:05:59
the relative ability of an
individual in a population to

53
00:05:59 --> 00:06:16
survive and reproduce.

54
00:06:16 --> 00:06:21
So, it's all relative,
OK, within a population.

55
00:06:21 --> 00:06:26
And we're going to define also,
we'll be talking about adaptations,

56
00:06:26 --> 00:06:31
and I know you know what this is,
but let's just make sure that we are

57
00:06:31 --> 00:06:37
all operating with the
same assumption.

58
00:06:37 --> 00:06:51
And an adaptation,
which is something that affects the

59
00:06:51 --> 00:07:05
fitness, is a heritable trait that
increases the fitness of an

60
00:07:05 --> 00:07:20
individual with respect to other
individuals in that population.

61
00:07:20 --> 00:07:25
So, these are just some operating
assumptions so that when we talk

62
00:07:25 --> 00:07:30
about species interactions,
there are several possibilities.

63
00:07:30 --> 00:07:37
If we have organism one and organism
two, we can have,

64
00:07:37 --> 00:07:44
and we ask how does the presence of
organism two and the presence of

65
00:07:44 --> 00:07:51
organism one affect the fitness of
the two organisms?

66
00:07:51 --> 00:07:58
And if the fitness of both
organisms is increased by being in

67
00:07:58 --> 00:08:06
the presence of the other,
that's called mutualism.

68
00:08:06 --> 00:08:13
Being together increases the fitness
of both relative to when they're

69
00:08:13 --> 00:08:20
alone.  If being together decreases
the fitness of both,

70
00:08:20 --> 00:08:28
that's called competition.
And if you have the situation,

71
00:08:28 --> 00:08:36
what we recall that?
It could be parasitism,

72
00:08:36 --> 00:08:44
yeah, parasitism.  What else?
Was the ultimate form of reduced

73
00:08:44 --> 00:08:52
fitness?  Predation,
yeah, being dead is the ultimate

74
00:08:52 --> 00:09:00
reduced fitness.  So, parasitism
and predation.

75
00:09:00 --> 00:09:06
And then there are some other sort
of rather vague interactions where

76
00:09:06 --> 00:09:12
when you put two individuals
together, the fitness of one is not

77
00:09:12 --> 00:09:18
influenced but the fitness of the
other is either influenced

78
00:09:18 --> 00:09:24
positively or negatively,
and we're not going to talk about

79
00:09:24 --> 00:09:30
those.  But this one's called
commencalism.  And this one's

80
00:09:30 --> 00:09:37
called amensalism.
And obviously there are gradients.

81
00:09:37 --> 00:09:44
Actually, an example of
commencalism is something that we've

82
00:09:44 --> 00:09:51
talked about.  Can anybody think
about what that is when we talked

83
00:09:51 --> 00:09:58
about food webs?
It's kind of a stretch,

84
00:09:58 --> 00:10:04
but detritivory.
An organism eating detritus,

85
00:10:04 --> 00:10:09
in a sense, is commencalism because
it doesn't affect the fitness of the

86
00:10:09 --> 00:10:13
dead individual because it's already
dead.  So, that gets to not having

87
00:10:13 --> 00:10:18
that much meaning.
So anyway, these we are not going

88
00:10:18 --> 00:10:23
to spend time on,
but they are forms of interaction

89
00:10:23 --> 00:10:28
that do exist.
And there are gradients between

90
00:10:28 --> 00:10:33
these.  Obviously, it's not
all black and white.

91
00:10:33 --> 00:10:46
So, we're going to start by talking
about competition.

92
00:10:46 --> 00:10:59
And just to remind you,
competition comes in two forms.

93
00:10:59 --> 00:11:12
There is intraspecific competition,
which means within a species, OK?

94
00:11:12 --> 00:11:19
And that's not what we're going to
be talking about today,

95
00:11:19 --> 00:11:27
but we've already talked about this
without explicitly,

96
00:11:27 --> 00:11:34
remember our logistic equation
and the density dependent feedback

97
00:11:34 --> 00:11:40
mechanisms in that population that
caused the population to deviate

98
00:11:40 --> 00:11:47
from exponential growth was due to
intraspecific competition:

99
00:11:47 --> 00:11:54
individuals within a species
competing with each other for

100
00:11:54 --> 00:12:01
resources.  We are going to talking
about now is more interspecific --

101
00:12:01 --> 00:12:20
-- which is competition

102
00:12:20 --> 00:12:31
between species, OK?
So, I want to show you some slides

103
00:12:31 --> 00:12:35
that are just from your textbook,
but just to get you in the mood for

104
00:12:35 --> 00:12:40
competition.  So,
it comes in all different forms,

105
00:12:40 --> 00:12:45
and I don't care whether you know
the names of these.

106
00:12:45 --> 00:12:49
It doesn't matter.  This is just to
give you an idea of the different

107
00:12:49 --> 00:12:54
types of competition that we see in
nature.  This is what's called

108
00:12:54 --> 00:12:59
consumptive competition,
and this is just showing the roots

109
00:12:59 --> 00:13:03
of the trees competing for nutrients
in the soil.  Preemptive competition

110
00:13:03 --> 00:13:08
shows these are barnacles.
We're going to talk a little bit

111
00:13:08 --> 00:13:12
more about that later,
just totally taking over the

112
00:13:12 --> 00:13:16
substrate.  So no other organism
could possibly settle there.

113
00:13:16 --> 00:13:21
Overgrowth competition in plants
where this plant would be shading,

114
00:13:21 --> 00:13:25
so other plants that require a lot
of light could not grow underneath.

115
00:13:25 --> 00:13:30
Chemical competition also occurs
where one plant will actually

116
00:13:30 --> 00:13:34
excrete certain chemicals that
create these corridors of no growth

117
00:13:34 --> 00:13:38
around them so other plants can't
get near to compete

118
00:13:38 --> 00:13:43
for the nutrients.
The classic form of competition,

119
00:13:43 --> 00:13:48
say, in birds and a lot of higher
organisms is competition for

120
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
territory.  So these are displays so
that an individual can keep a

121
00:13:52 --> 00:13:57
certain territory,
and therefore make that food

122
00:13:57 --> 00:14:02
available to itself,
therefore increasing its fitness

123
00:14:02 --> 00:14:07
because it's able to
feed its young.

124
00:14:07 --> 00:14:13
And then this is sort of the classic,
really tooth and claw competition

125
00:14:13 --> 00:14:19
where encounter competition where
all these species are competing over

126
00:14:19 --> 00:14:25
this zebra carcass,
hyena, vultures, etc.

127
00:14:25 --> 00:14:31
OK, now before we can talk more and
more in detail about competition,

128
00:14:31 --> 00:14:37
we need to define the ecological
niche.

129
00:14:37 --> 00:14:41
And this is an interesting concept
in ecology that has been around for

130
00:14:41 --> 00:14:45
quite some time,
and it kind of went out of

131
00:14:45 --> 00:14:50
popularity for a while.
And I was gratified to see that

132
00:14:50 --> 00:14:54
it's made it back into the
introductory biology textbooks

133
00:14:54 --> 00:14:59
because I think it's a very
profound concept.

134
00:14:59 --> 00:15:04
In this particular competition,
the fundamental ecological niche

135
00:15:04 --> 00:15:09
comes from G. Evelyn Hutchinson,
who is one of the founders of modern

136
00:15:09 --> 00:15:14
ecology.  He defined as the
fundamental niche of an organism as

137
00:15:14 --> 00:15:20
an N-dimensional hypervolume,
every point on which a species can

138
00:15:20 --> 00:15:25
survive and reproduce indefinitely
in the absence of other

139
00:15:25 --> 00:15:30
species, OK?
So, this is an abstract concept,

140
00:15:30 --> 00:15:35
because those species are rarely in
the absence of other species,

141
00:15:35 --> 00:15:40
except maybe in a test tube.  But it
defines the, and also we can't even

142
00:15:40 --> 00:15:45
think about N-dimensions,
right?  We're able to think about,

143
00:15:45 --> 00:15:50
we can envision three dimensions.
But what he's talking about here,

144
00:15:50 --> 00:15:55
is every single dimension in the
environment that would have any

145
00:15:55 --> 00:16:01
effect on the fitness
of an organism.

146
00:16:01 --> 00:16:05
So here, just to wrap our brains
around this, we're looking at three

147
00:16:05 --> 00:16:09
dimensions.  Our organisms here is a
ladybug, and this would be food size.

148
00:16:09 --> 00:16:14
These guys eat little aphids and
things.  I don't know if you've ever

149
00:16:14 --> 00:16:18
used them under house plants,
but it's a good way to keep aphids

150
00:16:18 --> 00:16:23
off your house plants if you want to
introduce ladybugs to your dorm room,

151
00:16:23 --> 00:16:27
which maybe you don't.
But there's a certain range of size,

152
00:16:27 --> 00:16:33
food size, that they can eat.
And so, that's three dimensions.

153
00:16:33 --> 00:16:39
There are undoubtedly many other
dimensions that we don't even know

154
00:16:39 --> 00:16:45
about, elements that they require,
etc.  So, this would be everywhere,

155
00:16:45 --> 00:16:51
in this space is a space where this
organism could survive and reproduce

156
00:16:51 --> 00:16:57
indefinitely.  And the reason this
concept lost favor is its something

157
00:16:57 --> 00:17:03
you could never ever measure this
because we can't know

158
00:17:03 --> 00:17:09
the N-dimensions.
Well, you can never say you can't

159
00:17:09 --> 00:17:13
know anything,
but it's very difficult to say you

160
00:17:13 --> 00:17:17
could know all the dimensions that
influence the fitness of an organism.

161
00:17:17 --> 00:17:21
But it's still a very important
concept for thinking about it.

162
00:17:21 --> 00:17:25
And the niche is not a physical
place, OK?  The niche of an organism

163
00:17:25 --> 00:17:30
is not a physical place.
In an N-dimensional hypervolume.

164
00:17:30 --> 00:17:35
It's an abstract concept.  So this
is the fundamental niche,

165
00:17:35 --> 00:17:39
and here's another closely related
species whose niche has some overlap

166
00:17:39 --> 00:17:44
with this one,
but has different ranges for

167
00:17:44 --> 00:17:49
temperature, humidity,
and food size.  And when you have

168
00:17:49 --> 00:17:54
overlapping niches is when you have
the possibility,

169
00:17:54 --> 00:17:59
the potential, for competition.
And two things can happen.

170
00:17:59 --> 00:18:04
If they overlap a lot,
than those two species cannot

171
00:18:04 --> 00:18:09
coexist in the same environment.
One will outcompete the other, and

172
00:18:09 --> 00:18:14
it will move on to some other place
where it doesn't have a strong

173
00:18:14 --> 00:18:19
competitor.  But if they overlap a
little, you can actually have

174
00:18:19 --> 00:18:24
competitive coexistence.
And we're going to talk about the

175
00:18:24 --> 00:18:29
results of these degrees of niche
overlap as we go on in the lecture.

176
00:18:29 --> 00:18:33
So, if the species can makes it
realized, so this is its fundamental

177
00:18:33 --> 00:18:38
niche, this one's fundamental niche,
and what happens if it can make its

178
00:18:38 --> 00:18:43
realized niche small enough so that
there's no niche overlap,

179
00:18:43 --> 00:18:48
then you can have coexistence of
those two species,

180
00:18:48 --> 00:18:53
or very little niche overlap in the
same environment.

181
00:18:53 --> 00:18:58
So that's the difference between
the fundamental and the

182
00:18:58 --> 00:19:04
realized niche.
I think this is from your textbook.

183
00:19:04 --> 00:19:10
This is just one dimension, seed
sized, for, say,

184
00:19:10 --> 00:19:16
a bird eating seeds of this size
range.  We'll be talking about birds

185
00:19:16 --> 00:19:22
a lot in this.
And here's partial niche overlap,

186
00:19:22 --> 00:19:28
species to where they eat some seeds
of the same size,

187
00:19:28 --> 00:19:34
but by and large the mode is
different.

188
00:19:34 --> 00:19:39
You can have species coexisting.
Partial niche overlap can lead to

189
00:19:39 --> 00:19:45
competitive coexistence.
And here's the complete overlap in

190
00:19:45 --> 00:19:51
just this one dimension,
which would lead to competitive

191
00:19:51 --> 00:19:57
exclusion.  But obviously it matters
what's happening on all the

192
00:19:57 --> 00:20:03
dimensions.  This is just an
oversimplification, to

193
00:20:03 --> 00:20:11
give you the idea.
OK, so before we go to that,

194
00:20:11 --> 00:20:23
I want to talk about the classic
experiment that led to this,

195
00:20:23 --> 00:20:35
they're going to put this screen up.
Screen, screen, screen, screen.

196
00:20:35 --> 00:20:56
Can you see, or do I need to turn

197
00:20:56 --> 00:21:01
the lights on?
Thank you.  I'm sorry,

198
00:21:01 --> 00:21:04
I always ask my questions that way,
where there's no possible answer.

199
00:21:04 --> 00:21:19


200
00:21:19 --> 00:21:25
There were some classic competition
experiments that's carried out by

201
00:21:25 --> 00:21:32
Gause way back in 1934 --
-- that I'm just going to use to

202
00:21:32 --> 00:21:38
illustrate the concept of
competitive exclusion,

203
00:21:38 --> 00:21:44
because these were done with very
simple protozoa in a test tube,

204
00:21:44 --> 00:21:50
paramecia, and actually this was
back in the days when they were

205
00:21:50 --> 00:21:56
developing these theories for
population growth.

206
00:21:56 --> 00:22:03
And these organisms were growing
according to the logistic equation.

207
00:22:03 --> 00:22:07
So here we are with,
and this is the classic experiment

208
00:22:07 --> 00:22:12
actually in your textbook that they
talk about in the context of the

209
00:22:12 --> 00:22:17
ecological niche.
So this is Paramecia caudatum.

210
00:22:17 --> 00:22:22
These names aren't important.
Don't worry about it,

211
00:22:22 --> 00:22:27
but we have to call them something.
P. aurelia, which, when grown alone

212
00:22:27 --> 00:22:32
in a test tube grow according to the
logistic equation,

213
00:22:32 --> 00:22:37
they grow up and then they level off
at a certain level.

214
00:22:37 --> 00:22:46
And what Gause did is that he wanted
to see, look at this phenomenon of

215
00:22:46 --> 00:22:55
competition and he grew them
together, and he found that,

216
00:22:55 --> 00:23:04
actually that no matter what
combination he put in,

217
00:23:04 --> 00:23:13
aurelia would always win out in
competitive exclusion.

218
00:23:13 --> 00:23:23
And he learned through a series of

219
00:23:23 --> 00:23:27
experiments, we don't have time to
go into the details,

220
00:23:27 --> 00:23:32
but this would always occur if you
made two species compete in a very

221
00:23:32 --> 00:23:37
simple environment.
In the test tube where he was

222
00:23:37 --> 00:23:41
feeding these guys exactly the same
food, some form of bacteria,

223
00:23:41 --> 00:23:46
in a test tube this one would always
outcompete the other,

224
00:23:46 --> 00:23:50
and there would be competitive
exclusion.  If he made the

225
00:23:50 --> 00:23:55
environment more complex,
where there were layers in it,

226
00:23:55 --> 00:23:59
or there was sediment in the bottom
of the test tube,

227
00:23:59 --> 00:24:04
that allowed more niche dimensions.
There were conditions under which

228
00:24:04 --> 00:24:10
the competitive coexistence would be
allowed.  And he actually developed

229
00:24:10 --> 00:24:15
a set of equations to describe his
competition that I'm going to write

230
00:24:15 --> 00:24:20
for you.  We're not going to use
them; we're not going to analyze

231
00:24:20 --> 00:24:26
them in detail,
but I'm just going to show them to

232
00:24:26 --> 00:24:31
you so that you have an appreciation
for how population ecologists and

233
00:24:31 --> 00:24:37
community ecologists start to think
about these systems.

234
00:24:37 --> 00:24:43
So, he said we can model this
interaction using our logistic

235
00:24:43 --> 00:24:50
equation.  So he said dN/dt would be
the growth rate of,

236
00:24:50 --> 00:24:57
let's call, the top one,
one.  It doesn't matter what you

237
00:24:57 --> 00:25:04
call which.  The dN/dt equals r1,
N1.  Now here's our logistic, K1

238
00:25:04 --> 00:25:11
minus N1 over K.
But he said I'm going to modify this

239
00:25:11 --> 00:25:18
equation so that the actual growth
of the organism is reduced to some

240
00:25:18 --> 00:25:25
amount that's proportional to the
number of the other organisms that

241
00:25:25 --> 00:25:32
are there.  So, he called
that alpha-N2.

242
00:25:32 --> 00:25:41
OK, so some amount that's
proportional to amount the other

243
00:25:41 --> 00:25:50
species that's here.
And then, he said dN2/DT is equal

244
00:25:50 --> 00:26:00
to r2, N2, K2 minus N2 minus beta-N1
over, this should be K1, over K2.

245
00:26:00 --> 00:26:05
So, the growth rate of species to in
the presence of species one is

246
00:26:05 --> 00:26:10
reduced by some amount that's
proportional to the abundance of

247
00:26:10 --> 00:26:15
species one.  And these,
the values of these, these are

248
00:26:15 --> 00:26:20
called competition coefficients.
You can actually do experiments and

249
00:26:20 --> 00:26:26
put values on these,
and they are a measure of how strong

250
00:26:26 --> 00:26:31
a competitor each of these species
are with respect to

251
00:26:31 --> 00:26:36
the other one.
So, you're not going to have to deal

252
00:26:36 --> 00:26:41
with these, but I just wanted you to
see them, and see how population

253
00:26:41 --> 00:26:46
ecologists began to model these
systems.  And so,

254
00:26:46 --> 00:26:52
it's the relative values of these
relative to the carrying capacities

255
00:26:52 --> 00:26:57
that will ultimately determine
whether species will coexist or not

256
00:26:57 --> 00:27:02
when they are competing.
OK, so that's more of a theoretical

257
00:27:02 --> 00:27:07
analysis.  Now let's look at the
real world.  Competitive exclusion,

258
00:27:07 --> 00:27:12
that is, the exclusion of one
species from an environment because

259
00:27:12 --> 00:27:16
of strong competition in another,
is very difficult to study, because

260
00:27:16 --> 00:27:21
if it's not there,
you don't know it was excluded,

261
00:27:21 --> 00:27:26
right?  I mean, you don't go to some
place and say I don't see

262
00:27:26 --> 00:27:31
the species here.
It must have been eliminated by

263
00:27:31 --> 00:27:36
competitive exclusion.
It might never have been there.

264
00:27:36 --> 00:27:40
So, the way we learn about this
phenomenon is either through

265
00:27:40 --> 00:27:45
inadvertent experiments,
and that is the introduction of

266
00:27:45 --> 00:27:50
species to new environments and then
see what happens,

267
00:27:50 --> 00:27:55
or actual intentional ecological
experiments.  So,

268
00:27:55 --> 00:28:00
we're going to talk about both of
those.

269
00:28:00 --> 00:28:11
And the first one --

270
00:28:11 --> 00:28:26
-- we'll talk about invasions --

271
00:28:26 --> 00:28:33
-- and competitive exclusion.
And one of the classic examples of

272
00:28:33 --> 00:28:41
this is the zebra mussel.
I don't know what happened.

273
00:28:41 --> 00:28:49
Oh, there it is.  I didn't realize
this was animated.

274
00:28:49 --> 00:28:57
That's why there was nothing there.
So, the zebra mussel is a tiny

275
00:28:57 --> 00:29:05
mussel that was introduced to the
United States back in,

276
00:29:05 --> 00:29:10
I guess, 1988.
And up here, introduced into the

277
00:29:10 --> 00:29:14
Great Lakes by ships just being
attached to ships,

278
00:29:14 --> 00:29:18
or it's possible it might have been
the larvae in ships' ballasts.

279
00:29:18 --> 00:29:22
Ships go into port, they take on
water into their ballasts to

280
00:29:22 --> 00:29:26
stabilize, and then they go to
another port and let it out.

281
00:29:26 --> 00:29:30
And they're filled with larvae and
species.

282
00:29:30 --> 00:29:37
So, the entire world oceans are now
filled with introduced species from

283
00:29:37 --> 00:29:44
ships ballasts.
So here's 1988.

284
00:29:44 --> 00:29:51
The zebra mussel is there.
1990: here.  92: here.  94,

285
00:29:51 --> 00:29:58
90 whatever, oh, 2001.  It spread
amazingly fast.

286
00:29:58 --> 00:30:04
And it is this tiny little mussel
that seems to thrive everywhere:

287
00:30:04 --> 00:30:10
clogs, all kinds of pipes,
settles on top of other native

288
00:30:10 --> 00:30:16
shellfish and kills them,
and has led to extensive competitive

289
00:30:16 --> 00:30:22
exclusion of native shellfish in a
number of ecosystems.

290
00:30:22 --> 00:30:28
Some of the effects of these: in
some ecosystems they cleared

291
00:30:28 --> 00:30:34
up the water.
They are able to filter just an

292
00:30:34 --> 00:30:39
amazing amount of water when they're
feeding.  So they actually have

293
00:30:39 --> 00:30:43
increased the clarity of the water
in many ecosystems,

294
00:30:43 --> 00:30:48
filtering out plankton,
which allows the light to penetrate

295
00:30:48 --> 00:30:53
deeper in those systems,
allowing aquatic plants to grow from

296
00:30:53 --> 00:30:58
the bottom.  So the introduction of
this one species can completely

297
00:30:58 --> 00:31:03
change the structure of
the entire ecosystem.

298
00:31:03 --> 00:31:06
I just heard a lecture.
I was just visiting the Institute

299
00:31:06 --> 00:31:10
for Ecosystem Studies which is out
in Millbrook, NY.

300
00:31:10 --> 00:31:14
By the way, if any of you are
looking for summer internships and

301
00:31:14 --> 00:31:17
are interested in ecology,
they have a fabulous summer

302
00:31:17 --> 00:31:21
internship program.
I've had several students go there

303
00:31:21 --> 00:31:25
that have had great experiences.
But there's somebody there studying

304
00:31:25 --> 00:31:29
the zebra mussel invasion
in the Hudson River.

305
00:31:29 --> 00:31:33
And he showed this incredibly
depressing graph of over the last

306
00:31:33 --> 00:31:37
ten years of the native mussels in
that river going down to basically

307
00:31:37 --> 00:31:42
extinction.  And then,
this is the weird thing about

308
00:31:42 --> 00:31:46
ecosystems, just last year it
started to turn around.

309
00:31:46 --> 00:31:50
And they haven't done anything to
eradicate the zebra mussels,

310
00:31:50 --> 00:31:55
but the native mussels are starting
to have a comeback.

311
00:31:55 --> 00:31:59
And nobody knows why,
and nobody knows whether it's a real

312
00:31:59 --> 00:32:04
comeback because it could come back
for a couple of years.

313
00:32:04 --> 00:32:10
So, it's really interesting how
unpredictable these complex systems

314
00:32:10 --> 00:32:17
are.  But these mussels can cause
millions and millions of dollars of

315
00:32:17 --> 00:32:23
damage.  And I also learned on that
trip that ecologists are trying to

316
00:32:23 --> 00:32:30
get in place policies that if an
industry for whatever reasons wants

317
00:32:30 --> 00:32:36
to intentionally introduce,
Here's an example of an application

318
00:32:36 --> 00:32:40
of fundamental ecological knowledge.
The reason people study the ecology

319
00:32:40 --> 00:32:45
of invasive species,
understanding this competitive

320
00:32:45 --> 00:32:49
exclusion and all that,
is that you want to use that

321
00:32:49 --> 00:32:54
understanding to be able to predict,
if you introduce a new species to a

322
00:32:54 --> 00:32:58
new habitat, whether it will be
invasive or not,

323
00:32:58 --> 00:33:03
there are some species you can
introduce and they will fit right in

324
00:33:03 --> 00:33:08
and not exclude every
other species.

325
00:33:08 --> 00:33:13
And so, what they're trying to put
in place is insurance that a company

326
00:33:13 --> 00:33:18
would have to buy that was either
intentionally introducing a species,

327
00:33:18 --> 00:33:23
or whatever practice that they were
doing was likely to introduce a

328
00:33:23 --> 00:33:28
species, and the cost of that
insurance would be a function of the

329
00:33:28 --> 00:33:34
probability of that species actually
causing competitive exclusion.

330
00:33:34 --> 00:33:39
And this is something that people
are trying to put into place in to

331
00:33:39 --> 00:33:45
the economic system basically.
So, it puts a new meaning to

332
00:33:45 --> 00:33:50
limited liability company,
LLC.  So, you have to insure your

333
00:33:50 --> 00:33:56
liability, which I think would go a
long way to reduce some of these

334
00:33:56 --> 00:34:01
ecological crises.
OK, so that's an inadvertent

335
00:34:01 --> 00:34:06
experiment.  Now there are many,
many examples of this.  There's

336
00:34:06 --> 00:34:11
books written on invasive species.
And if I can get this thing to work,

337
00:34:11 --> 00:34:16
I'll show you some clips of invasive
species, snakes.

338
00:34:16 --> 00:34:20
And the biggest impact is on
islands because islands have been

339
00:34:20 --> 00:34:25
isolated ecosystems for so long that
if you introduce a species,

340
00:34:25 --> 00:34:30
you have dramatic changes.  In
Australia, a big example was a

341
00:34:30 --> 00:34:35
prickly pear cactus which was
introduced many years ago to create

342
00:34:35 --> 00:34:40
living fences for livestock.
They completely took over not all of

343
00:34:40 --> 00:34:46
the grasslands,
but a lot of the grasslands and turn

344
00:34:46 --> 00:34:51
them into thickets.
OK, so invasive species are

345
00:34:51 --> 00:34:57
inadvertent ecological experiments.
Let's talk about intentional

346
00:34:57 --> 00:35:02
experiments.  And this is also very
classic textbook experiment that was

347
00:35:02 --> 00:35:08
one of the first ecological
experiments to be done.

348
00:35:08 --> 00:35:12
And it was done with barnacles.
This was Joseph Connell was a

349
00:35:12 --> 00:35:17
professor at the University of
California, Santa Barbara.

350
00:35:17 --> 00:35:21
Barnacles have a larval stage that
floats around in the plankton,

351
00:35:21 --> 00:35:26
and then they settle on rocks.  So
this was a classic barnacle

352
00:35:26 --> 00:35:31
ecosystem in Scotland,
actually, in which the upper inner

353
00:35:31 --> 00:35:36
tidal there is a species
called Chthamalus.

354
00:35:36 --> 00:35:40
And then the lower was dominated by
a species of mussel called Balanus.

355
00:35:40 --> 00:35:45
So, he asked the question, is this
distribution where the two are

356
00:35:45 --> 00:35:49
exclusive of one another,
is it due to competition between

357
00:35:49 --> 00:35:54
them, or is it just that this one
tolerates desiccation longer than

358
00:35:54 --> 00:35:58
this one?  The inner tidal zone,
the tide goes up and down, so this

359
00:35:58 --> 00:36:03
one's going to be exposed to dryness
a lot longer.

360
00:36:03 --> 00:36:07
So, how do you answer that question?
Well, you do an experiment and so

361
00:36:07 --> 00:36:12
what he did was he took rocks from
the upper, inner tidal that had the

362
00:36:12 --> 00:36:17
Chthamalus on them,
and he moved them to the lower one.

363
00:36:17 --> 00:36:22
And he let the Balanus, the species
that dominates down here colonize on

364
00:36:22 --> 00:36:27
those rocks.  But then he divided
them in half, and removed the

365
00:36:27 --> 00:36:32
Balanus from half of the rock.
And then he monitored the

366
00:36:32 --> 00:36:37
survivorship of the Chthamalus.
And remember the survivorship

367
00:36:37 --> 00:36:41
curves that we talked about when we
created those life tables,

368
00:36:41 --> 00:36:46
he actually measured survivorship
curves on these.

369
00:36:46 --> 00:36:51
If you go to the original paper,
you see LX is a function of time.

370
00:36:51 --> 00:36:56
So that's a tool that we use,
to ask the question, is the

371
00:36:56 --> 00:37:01
survivorship of Chthamalus increased
in the absence of Balanus?

372
00:37:01 --> 00:37:05
And this is all from your textbook,
showing that the percent of

373
00:37:05 --> 00:37:09
mortality, when a competitor is
present is much higher than the

374
00:37:09 --> 00:37:14
competitor is absent.
So, he's able to show directly that

375
00:37:14 --> 00:37:18
there was competition between the
two.  And in fact,

376
00:37:18 --> 00:37:23
this was that kind of aggressive
kind of competition where one just

377
00:37:23 --> 00:37:27
plucks the other one off the rock.
I mean it's direct: you're on my

378
00:37:27 --> 00:37:32
rock; get out of here,
and it pops it off.

379
00:37:32 --> 00:37:37
He also was able to show that
tolerance to desiccation is also a

380
00:37:37 --> 00:37:42
factor in this system.
It's not like it's totally

381
00:37:42 --> 00:37:47
competition.  But competition was
playing a role,

382
00:37:47 --> 00:37:52
and so I've summarized that in this
slide using our terminology.

383
00:37:52 --> 00:37:57
He was able to show that the
fundamental niche of Chthamalus,

384
00:37:57 --> 00:38:05
in other words --
-- the region in the inner tidal,

385
00:38:05 --> 00:38:15
where the larvae could actually
settle and live in the absence of

386
00:38:15 --> 00:38:25
competitors was much broader than
the realized niche.

387
00:38:25 --> 00:38:36
All right, so let's get this over.
This is from your textbook.

388
00:38:36 --> 00:38:50
And we're going to just use,
I'm going to use an example of that.

389
00:38:50 --> 00:39:04
So, competition can also lead to
character displacement --

390
00:39:04 --> 00:39:18
-- which in turn can lead to actual

391
00:39:18 --> 00:39:27
competitive coexistence.
And an example of this, we're going

392
00:39:27 --> 00:39:37
to talk about Darwin's finches in
the Galapagos Islands.

393
00:39:37 --> 00:39:46
And one of the ways that ecologists
actually measure,

394
00:39:46 --> 00:39:56
that's a bird, in case you didn't
notice it.  And this

395
00:39:56 --> 00:40:04
is beak depth.
The shape and size of a beak tells

396
00:40:04 --> 00:40:11
you what kinds of seeds a bird can
eat, and so they measured beak depth

397
00:40:11 --> 00:40:18
as a niche dimension,
basically, because it tells you what

398
00:40:18 --> 00:40:26
size seeds the bird can eat.
And a study was done; we're going

399
00:40:26 --> 00:40:33
to make the islands here.
What is going to call them A,

400
00:40:33 --> 00:40:41
B, C, D; these are islands.
And there are two species of finches,

401
00:40:41 --> 00:40:49
which we are just going to call F.
Well, they're fuliginosa.  Again,

402
00:40:49 --> 00:40:57
the name's not important,
and the other one is called fortis.

403
00:40:57 --> 00:41:05
So, we'll just call them,

404
00:41:05 --> 00:41:12
on islands that have both of them,
and there are some islands that have

405
00:41:12 --> 00:41:18
only one.  So,
what was done is they measure the

406
00:41:18 --> 00:41:25
beak depth of the different finches
on the islands where they were found

407
00:41:25 --> 00:41:32
together versus islands where they
were found alone in the

408
00:41:32 --> 00:41:40
Galapagos Islands.
And what they found,

409
00:41:40 --> 00:41:48
and this has been shown for many,
many different studies.  You look at

410
00:41:48 --> 00:42:07
the beak depth distribution.

411
00:42:07 --> 00:42:23
This is percent in size class.
And this is island C, D, and A,

412
00:42:23 --> 00:42:34
and B.
And they found that when the species

413
00:42:34 --> 00:42:42
were on islands where they lived
alone, they had almost complete

414
00:42:42 --> 00:42:49
niche, oh this is beak depth.
They had exactly the same size beak

415
00:42:49 --> 00:42:57
distributions.
In other words,

416
00:42:57 --> 00:43:05
they were feeding on the same food.
And on the islands where they were

417
00:43:05 --> 00:43:13
together, A and B,
I'm just making sure this actually

418
00:43:13 --> 00:43:21
holds together,
they found what is called character

419
00:43:21 --> 00:43:29
displacement, and that is that the
birds that had longer beaks and

420
00:43:29 --> 00:43:37
smaller beaks,
were preferentially selected for

421
00:43:37 --> 00:43:45
such that reducing the amount
of niche overlap.

422
00:43:45 --> 00:44:03
So, and this leads to competitive
coexistence.

423
00:44:03 --> 00:44:07
OK, and that's what we're looking at
here.  This is from your textbooks.

424
00:44:07 --> 00:44:12
This is from African seed crackers
showing that birds with smaller

425
00:44:12 --> 00:44:16
bills consume soft seeds more
efficiently.  Birds with larger

426
00:44:16 --> 00:44:21
bills crack hard seeds,
and you can see that the width of

427
00:44:21 --> 00:44:24
the bill here is different.
