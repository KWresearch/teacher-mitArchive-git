<p></p>
<p>OK. Today we're going to get into some stuff where we're kind of  peering way back in evolution about how life first learned to make  energy. But before we do that I just want to finish up talking a little  bit more about enzymes, the biological catalysts that are critical for  life to exist and about how energy is stored. I want to clarify a point  that clearly confused a couple of you in the last lecture.</p>
<p>So the  Gibbs free energy that we talked about can tell us that a reaction could  go and, in this case, would actually release energy if it occurred, if  these reactants were converted to these products. But the problem for  most reactions is that in order for the reaction to take place there's a  state in the middle, some chemical state known as the transition state  which is energetically less favorable than either the reactants or the  products.</p>
<p>And if A and B are going to convert to C and D they have  to probably start coming together in some kind of way, and that becomes  energetically unfavorable. And this gives this activation energy -- --  or delta G00. And if the cell wants chemical reactions to take place at  25 degrees Centigrade aqueous solution it has to do something about  that, and so it employs biological catalysts. And what a catalyst does,  as you've heard in chemistry, is it lowers the activation energy in some  way so that the molecules have enough energy just within their normal  energy distribution at that temperature to get over the hump.</p>
<p>These  biological catalysts come in two flavors. As I said there are enzymes  which are made of protein with all of those amino acids, the side chains  that we talked about when the thing folds up in 3-dimensional space  form a little chemical environment that enables that activation energy  to be lowered. There are also few -- Not so many. But we now know that  there are catalysts made out of RNA.</p>
<p>These are called ribozymes.  There are not so many of them but they're important. Now, the  characteristics of these that are important is the specificity -- Each  enzyme or ribozyme is highly specific for a given reaction. So that  means the reaction probably will barely go unless that enzyme or, in  some cases, ribozyme is present. And so that's really the secret to how  cells control all of these many, many, many hundreds or thousands of  chemical reactions that take place that are necessary for life.</p>
<p>Because  what they need to do, and if they want to control whether a reaction  takes place or not is they to control the availability or the activity  of an enzyme. And when we talk about gene regulation you'll see, for  example, one way a cell might do it is to not even bother to make the  enzyme unless it wants a particular reaction to take place. Or it could  take an enzyme that's there and put little bells and whistles on it that  make it more active or less active.</p>
<p>And we'll see an example of  that pretty soon. That is the secret to how cells are then able to  regulate metabolism. And these biological catalysts use a whole variety  of different molecular mechanisms, although all of them follow this  principle of what they're trying to do is lower the activation energy.  So I'll just give you an example. I showed you how one particular enzyme  does it just in sort of cartoon form.</p>
<p>I gave you the example of  glutamate being converted to glutamine. Now, both of those are amino  acids that are critical for making proteins. The cell has to make both  of them. But as I showed you converting glutamate to glutamine is  energetically unfavorable. It's got a delta G plus 7. And then I showed  you if you had an ATP going to ADP at the same time you could actually  drive the whole reaction forward because there was a net gain.</p>
<p>But  how is that actually accomplished? And it's the enzyme that carries  this out. And I'll just show you, as I say, in sort of cartoon form. The  way the enzyme works it has one binding pocket for glutamic acid or  glutamate. It fits in here. It makes lots of specialized contacts, all  those sort of molecular interactions we're talking about. And it also  binds this molecule adenine triphosphate or ATP which is an adenine, a  ribose and then three phosphates joined together.</p>
<p>And it makes  interactions along here that enable it to bind very specifically. Now,  by providing all this binding energy for ATP and for glutamic acid what  the enzyme has done is positioned the carboxyl group of glutamic acid  right next to the last phosphate on the ATP. This enables this to form a  bond here which liberates ADP and leaves you now with the glutamic acid  with a phosphate on.</p>
<p>That reaction goes forward because you broke  the bond of ATP, but this is still a pretty unhappy molecule. It's got a  lot of oxygens at very close proximity. So the enzyme has another  binding pocket that's absolutely specific for ammonia. It won't fit  water which is very close, which is a good thing because that would just  reverse the process. Ammonia gets in there and then it attacks here and  liberates the phosphate.</p>
<p>And that then gives you glutamine and  the inorganic phosphate. So the enzyme has provided this binding surface  that makes the reactions go under biological conditions. But it's also  managed in the same process to have it go by a mechanism in which it  sort of temporarily captured that energy that's in the ATP bond and then  used it to drive the rest of the reaction.</p>
<p>I mean it's the magic  of how all of this developed. It's really amazing but that's how every  single biochemical step in your body takes place. Virtually of them  require an enzyme that in some way is highly tuned to do just the one  single reaction. As I said, the principle of how these enzymes work is  they lower the activation energy. And the way they do that in general is  they provide a binding pocket that resembles the transition state.</p>
<p>So  as things approach here then it fits best into the pocket and therefore  you get some energy back and kind of lowered the energy hump that's  necessary to go over. And here's a reaction I'll be showing you in  today's lecture. It's going to involve the transfer of a phosphate to a  glucose. And the first thing that happens is this enzyme interacts with  ATP and takes one of the phosphates and attaches it to one of its  aspartic acid carboxyl groups.</p>
<p>So you've got actually a mixed in  hydride if you know chemistry. But again it's captured that phosphate.  This is a very unstable bond. And so if you break it you will release  energy. And what the enzyme does is it allows the hydroxyl of here to  come and attack this phosphate, and that then releases the aspartate of  the enzyme and you end up affecting the transfer of the phosphate that  began life on ATP.</p>
<p>And now it ends up on the glucose. But, as you  can see here, phosphate interacts with four atoms. But as this hydroxyl  comes in it has to attack the phosphate. And somewhere in the middle  there's an intermediate where all of these things are interacting. And  some crystallographers actually managed to capture that in a crystal  structure. And here you can see this is the oxygen coming from the  sugar, this is the oxygen of the aspartate and here is the phosphate  where it's now, as the attack is taking place the thing is sort of  pushed out, and it's caught right at that transition state.</p>
<p>And  that's what the enzyme is providing a binding pocket for and thereby  lowering the activation energy. It's a really beautiful piece of  structural work. The second thing then I want to clarify was this  molecule ATP which is, as I say, like energy money for the cell. When  there's a reaction where it can extract energy it tries to make ATP. And  when there's a reaction that doesn't want to go it will somehow figure  out a way to spend that energy and make the reaction go forward.</p>
<p>And  the molecule, just to put it again, because it's a pretty important one  in biology. That's adenine which you already saw when we talked about  nucleic acids. And it's got three phosphates like this. You can see it's  probably a pretty unhappy molecule because it's got all of these  oxygens stuck together. And if you break this bond then you release some  energy.</p>
<p>So you could think of it in this kind of way. That if we  have ADP, which is adenosine diphosphate plus inorganic phosphate, and  ATP is here. And if you were to break the bond and make it back into ADP  and inorganic phosphate then you would have gone energetically  downhill. But in order to make this you could think of it as taking an  inorganic phosphate ion and this ADP, if you start pushing them together  the negative charges are going to repel and you kind of go up an energy  hill.</p>
<p>But if you ever get them close enough then they start to  share electrons and they fall into this sort of energy well. And this is  what ATP is. And so it's sort of like taking a spring and pushing it  together. And then when you form the bond it's like you put a little  hook on it. And now you've got this spring that's compressed. And it's  stable, it won't do anything, but there's energy stored in there that  you can use.</p>
<p>And it's the same principle in terms of how the cell  stores energy within ATP. And this energy is stored -- -- if you think  of it in bundles of about 12 kilocalories per mole. That's about how  much energy is released under physiological conditions when you  hydrolyze that bond. So hydrolyzing ATP to give ADP plus inorganic  phosphate will have a delta G of minus 12 kilocalories per mole under  physiological conditions.</p>
<p>Now something in terms of evolution,  which I know a number of you said you were interested in, here's a  really interesting thing. This is the main energy storage molecule for  the cell, but you've heard about it before because adenosine, that's the  nucleotide that we find in RNA. And, in fact, ATP is also the  precursor, as we'll learn, for making RNA.</p>
<p>And one of the things  that puzzled scientists for many years is how did life ever get started  in the first place? There seemed to be a chicken and an egg issue that  proteins did the work and DNA stored the information and RNA was kind of  a messenger in between, and we'll talk a lot about that in between. So  how could you ever get life started? So the current thinking is that  sometime, if you remember in that first lecture, we had about 4.</p>
<p>5  billion years ago the first organism, something like today's bacterium  showed up here about maybe 3.8 billion years ago. That somewhere in  between there was what people are now thinking of as an "RNA world"  where RNA managed to act as a ribosome and catalyzed chemical reactions,  but it also had the capacity to store information. But it's sort of  intriguing, although no one has proven that.</p>
<p>It's just a  hypothesis. We also see that the major energy storage molecule found in  all living things is also a building block of RNA. It certainly sort of  fits with that kind of idea. Now, there's one other kind of reaction I'm  going to have to tell you about. Penny will talk quite a bit about this  when you're thinking about how organisms make living.</p>
<p>But this is  a set of reactions known as "redox reactions". So the loss of one or  more electron(s) is called an oxidation. And the gain of one or more  electron(s) is called a reduction. If you're going to take away an  electron somebody else has to get it. So these things always happen  together. And therefore they're given the term redox reactions where  electron(s) from somebody goes to somebody else.</p>
<p>So somebody gets  oxidized and somebody gets reduced in the same reaction. And you can  think of them as a transfer of hydrogen atoms, not hydrogon ions. And  the most familiar kind of sequence that you will see over and over again  in biology is the sequence you go from, let's say, a methyl group to an  alcohol with a hydroxyl to an aldehyde or a ketone with the double bond  oxygen to a carboxyl group.</p>
<p>You go one more step then it's CO2.  So going in this direction it's an oxidation. If it's going in that  direction the molecules are getting reduced. Just the same way that the  cell and life have molecules that store energy in ATP, they also have an  important molecule that stores electrons. And that molecule is known as  NAD or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. NAD+.</p>
<p>And its structure  is, let's say a ribose, a five carbon sugar. And it's got this entity  on it. This is in your book so don't worry if you don't get the  structure down. There's a positive charge on the nitrogen here. And it's  joined through a diphosphate linkage to, guess what? Another molecule  of adenosine. Here we find again a piece of a thing we find in RNA is  now part of this system for storing electrons.</p>
<p>And the way this  works is if you have two hydrogen atoms transferred to here then this  entity right here goes to this plus a hydrogen ion. And this we would  know is NADH. I left out an oxygen here. Somebody picked it up.  [LAUGHTER] Just too excited by the annual Valentine's Day visit here. I  wish the rest of you had a song for you, too, but we didn't have time to  set that up. So there's an important thing here, too, because actually a  lot of energy is stored in there.</p>
<p>This is a bundle of energy in  this molecule that's actually about 50 kilocalories per mole. And  especially when we get to next week's lecture you'll see how cells go  about extracting the energy out of that and making that energy into ATP,  which is sort of a universal currency the cells can spend. Now,  somebody asked about memorizing all of these structures I mean really,  As Julia says in her thing, we're trying to get you to focus on the  concepts here.</p>
<p>You won't have to memorize the structure of  everything. It would be helpful if you recognized that glutamine and  glutamate are of the 20 amino acids, but we'll give you the structures  and we'll give you the structures of something like NADH if you needed  to do something with it. But the important thing is to remember that  energy is stored in that high energy bond of ATP, that electrons are  stored in this NADH, and they can be used in reactions that oxidize or  reduce.</p>
<p>NAD and NADH can be used in reactions that remove or give  electrons to biomolecules. Now, the same thing goes for what I'm about  to tell you now because one of the first things that had to happen as  life evolved was there had to be some mechanism of getting energy made.  And the reaction I'm going to tell you about is called glycolysis. And  it's a way of taking a molecule of glucose through a whole series of  biochemical transformations and to end up yielding -- -- two molecules  of something that's known as pyruvate.</p>
<p>And it also makes two  molecules of ATP and two molecules of NADH. So it's a way that was  invented in evolution of making ATP by carrying out a chemical  transformation. And this is basically the same chemical transformation  that we've been talking about that Lavoisier and Pasteur studied except  that, as I'll show you, you do a little bit to convert it either to  lactate or to ethanol.</p>
<p>I'll get to that in a few minutes. Remember  the point, also just to remind you, the reason I gave you that  historical thing is because what it turned out when people started out  to study something, was winemaking of great interest to French  scientists, was what they actually learned was how cells made energy.  And, in fact, here we're looking at a sort of biochemical fossil in a  way because this pathway of glycolysis, which you'll see is kind of  awkward.</p>
<p>It's got ten different biochemical steps, it needs ten  different enzymes, and what the cells got out of it is two molecules of  ATP. But this system developed apparently way, way back in evolution  before life forms got into these various Kingdoms because it's in  virtually in every living creature no matter what it is and it's  essentially biochemically identical. Now, it's possible we could go back  nowadays and devise a better method, but once that something like that  gets fixed in evolution, if something mutates to try and change it most  of the time it's a disadvantage.</p>
<p>And so if something gets locked  in, and this is true of many, many of these very complicated biochemical  pathways. So you won't have to remember all these structures I'm going  to put on the board, but try and stay with me because I want to sort of  show you one of these. This is probably the most ancient of these  pathways. And it's still in all of us. It's in the bacteria in our guts.  It's in the plants in the field.</p>
<p>If you go out in the open ocean  organisms still can carry out glycolysis. So one thing, though, I want  to try and put it in this way, if I came to you and said I've got the  greatest idea. This is going to be how we're going to make energy and  evolution as part of this entrepreneurship, I think you'd be right to be  skeptical so I'll probably sort of tell you in that way. So I've  already shown you how to write glucose in a linear form, although I then  told you that most of the time in solution it's cyclized into a  pyranose ring, a six membered ring.</p>
<p>But for the moment we can  think of glucose as a stick. And I'll get you to just focus on the one  position, the two position and the six position in that linear thing. If  you look back at your notes you can see what the full structure of  glucose looks like. But this is how the process of glycolysis starts.  This is if your body is going to take a molecule of glucose and make  energy out of it, this is the first thing it does.</p>
<p>It takes an  ATP. It converts it to an ADP. It puts the phosphate down here to give  glucose-6- phosphate. That's the only thing that changes. Isn't this  just like most young entrepreneurs? Give them some venture capital. The  first thing they do is spend it, buy a nice potted plant for the company  they're building. It doesn't seem to be, if you want to make energy,  starting out here spending energy is the first thing that the cell is  doing.</p>
<p>It's using up an ADP, although the overall goal is to make  ATP. It then does a little shuffle, reverses the position of the double  bond and the hydroxyl. This is an energetically something without much  cost, but this sugar is different because this is now  fructose-6-phosphate. It's got a little bit different arrangement of the  double bond and the hydroxyl, but energetically it's pretty much the  same thing.</p>
<p>Then the next thing that happens the cells spends  another molecule of ATP. It gives now -- -- fructose-1,6, this is the  sixth position, the one position to two position, 1,6-diphosphate. It  doesn't look like we're on our way to make energy yet. Cells invested  two molecules of ATP and what it's done is it's got this glucose  transformed to fructose 1,6-disphopshate.</p>
<p>Well, what happens now  then is the cell splits this into two three carbon units. There were six  carbons in glucose. Yeah? Well, it's a linear molecule. There's a  phosphate here and a separate phosphate down there. They should be.  Yeah. I'm probably dropping charges and hydroxyls, OK? But check your  book if you notice something like that. So what we get -- What the cell  gets out of this then are two three carbon units, one of which is this  -- -- known as dihydroxyacetone phosphate.</p>
<p>And you can find these  names in your book. You don't have to, as I say, remember the  structures. What I've done is basically taken this molecule and I've  flipped it over so that the phosphate will be down. And you'll see why  I've done that in a second. And from the bottom half of the molecule  then we get -- This is glycereldahyde-3-phosphate. So this is three  carbons.</p>
<p>This is three carbons. This was six carbons. So the cell  has split it into these three carbon units that are very similarly  related except where the double bond is. And there's an enzyme that  actually catalyzes the conversion of those two. It's a catalytically  perfect enzyme that goes. It's just limited by the rate of diffusion.  And it can do something of the order of ten to the eighth molecules a  second.</p>
<p>It's a really, really efficient catalyst. So what happens  then is this, since these are in equilibrium the cell is going to now  start to pull these -- This. But these will be converted into that and  will be able to get here. So we're going to follow the fate then of  these -- -- two glycaraldahyde-3-phosphate molecules. Excuse me. Sorry.  OK. Now, at this point the cell is at the aldehyde stage.</p>
<p>And it's  going to carry out an oxidation reaction. So it's going to take a  couple of electrons away from here, and it's going to therefore be  carrying out an oxidation. If the molecule is getting oxidized something  else has to be reduced. What's going to get reduced is NAD+. We'll need  two molecules of that because we've got two molecules of glyceraldehyde  phosphate.</p>
<p>So we end up with two molecules of NADH plus a  hydrogen ion. And this is an energetically favorable reaction. So the  cell is able to sneak a phosphate in and make a molecule and still have  the reaction go forward, have a molecule that's not very stable, but it  can make it because the overall thing goes forward. And there are two of  these. And what we have now is 1,3-phosphoglycerate.</p>
<p>What the  cell has basically managed to do is to get two phosphate groups very,  very close together. So you're probably getting, hopefully, the concept  that if you stick a bunch of negative charges together and hold them  together that molecules, if you break one of those bonds are going to go  energetically downhill. And you can do work. And the way it does that  then is in breaking this bond it uses it to make two molecules of ATP.</p>
<p>So  you've now got, this is up at the acid level or a carboxyl group. And  we've got three phosphoglycerate. So at least from the point of view of  this as a plan for making energy, we've now managed to get back those  two ATPs we invested. So up until now we've got our, the venture capital  money we put in has be recovered, and we've got a couple of molecules  of NADH out of it. But what the cell now does is finish, to carry out  some more steps that let it make a couple more molecules of ATP.</p>
<p>So  the first step then is a kind of just a switcheroo between where this  hydroxyl is and this phosphate is. So it brings the phosphate up to  here. As you might guess this is energetically not much of a change.  However, what it does now is it enables the cell to eliminate a molecule  of water from here so we get two molecules of water come out because we  had all along here we're carrying on two molecules from up there  because we have two of these three carbon units.</p>
<p>Then the molecule  that we then get here -- -- is this molecule which is known as  phosphoenolpyruvate. And several of you are saying you don't remember  much from chemistry. So this is a keto group, which I know you were  introduced to. But it's in an equilibrium with what's termed an enol  form where you have an OH here, a double bond like that, and that's  known as an enol. Now, this is energetically greatly disfavored.</p>
<p>So  normally most of the time you find something in a keto form, but  occasionally you find it in an enol form. And what's happened here  really is the cell has trapped what would like to be a keto at this  position in an enol form. Again, this is a very energetically unstable  molecule. You've got all these oxygens together, two of these, and so  the cell is once again able to take ADP and make two molecules of ATP.</p>
<p>And  we end up with -- -- two molecules of pyruvate. And extraordinary  amount of work. What do we get out of it? Well, we've got a total of  four ATPs now plus two NADHs. What did we invest? Two ATPs. So the net  yield from this reaction is two ATPs plus two NADHs. So strange as it  seems this was one of the first sequences of biochemical steps that were  put together in a pathway that were capable of letting an organism  generate molecules of ATP, or sort of form of energy money by  metabolizing something it could find like a molecule of sugar.</p>
<p>There  are two enzymatic steps. That means that there has to be a separate  enzyme for every step in the pathway. Now, the ATPs, as I said, have  energy in bundles of about 12 kilocalories per mole. There's a lot of  energy here in NADH. And in the next lecture I'm going to talk to you  about respiration, which is something you're aware of. You know we  respire, but chemically what that we'll see means is basically it's a  way of extracting the energy that's in the NADH by transferring  electrons to oxygen.</p>
<p>And that's a wonderful way to make energy.  It's far more efficient than this ancient pathway, but at the time life  started there wasn't any oxygen in the environment. And, in fact, it  didn't reach, as I said, I think it was something like 20% of today's  levels until we were about a half a billion years or so ago in  evolution. So organisms had to learn to make energy without oxygen being  around.</p>
<p>And this was the way that they did it. And it was such a  success in evolution that our bodies do it, the bacteria in our gut do  it and just virtually all living forms. So it's sort of a biochemical  fossil but it was so successful it took hold. It's sort of like legs.  Those appeared in evolution. And there are all sorts of organisms now  that use legs, and they've evolved into wings and everything, but it's  all the same basic idea.</p>
<p>You could imagine a life form that  started with wheels. And maybe if it had been the first thing to do  maybe there'd be some sort of organisms with wheels, but legs were such a  success at some point that that's what got used and then evolution made  various embellishments on it. But there is a problem here. I don't know  if anybody can see what it is.</p>
<p>If I'm going to be able to use ATP  to make energy and I want to keep generating more and more molecules of  ATP so I can build stuff, I cannot give those electrons in NADH to  oxygen. So what would happen if I just kept running this system? Anybody  see what the problem would be? Yeah. You'd run out of NADH, exactly. We  need to somehow recycle that NAD so it can take place. If we could give  it to oxygen, oxygen as I've told you in respiration, that would be  cool.</p>
<p>But organisms didn't have that option. And so they worked  out ways of doing things with pyruvate. And this is where you'll see  this coming together with what we talked about the other day. So let's  take those two molecules of pyruvate. And there are basically two  strategies, two major strategies you find in nature. One is to take the  two NADHs plus two hydrogen ions and convert it to two molecules of NAD+  so that regenerates it.</p>
<p>And what do you get if you do that? You  end up with this molecule. Two molecules of that which I introduced you  to the other day. That's lactic acid or lactate, the organisms that make  yogurt carry out. That's what they do. That's why yogurt goes sour.  What the organisms are doing when they're making the yogurt that you had  for lunch, I love those pictures. I found them on the Web and put them  in.</p>
<p>What they're doing really is they're getting rid of that NADH  so that they can do another cycle and make more energy. Now, I mentioned  that this happens to us, too. And this happens in athletic events where  you exercise really, really hard, you know, like sprints or speed  skating or something like that. Because what happens is you're  exercising so hard that you use up the oxygen in your muscles faster  than your bloodstream can bring you more.</p>
<p>So what you're doing is  you're making your muscles go anaerobic. It's like you're going back  way, way in evolution when there's was no oxygen around. And your  muscles have to keep working, so what they do, since there's no oxygen  around, they stick it on pyruvate and you get lactic acid in your  muscles. So if you go out for the track team in the spring and you  haven't exercised and you run a whole lot of sprints and, God, your  muscles are so sore, they're all full of lactic acid.</p>
<p>So you don't  have to worry about it accumulating in your muscles from eating yogurt,  but it does show up in this kind of way. And the other thing then that  the way nature has found to recycle these NADHs is to it this way, to  carry out a transformation where you get two molecules of carbon dioxide  and two molecules of acetaldehyde. And this can be converted to the two  molecules of carbon dioxide and two molecules of ethanol.</p>
<p>So this  is the fermentation that we talked about. And so when those yeasts that  we saw growing the other day are busy metabolizing sugar into ethanol  and carbon dioxide, the reason they're doing it is they need to get  energy to carry out all the biosynthetic reactions that they need to  make more biomaterial. But what's happening to the whole system is that  you're generating carbon dioxide and making stuff into ethanol.</p>
<p>So  it doesn't matter if people are making wine or beer or something  they're going to distil to make whiskey or brandy or something. It's all  the basic thing. The yeast take the sugars, make it into carbon dioxide  and to ethanol. But when you're making bread you're only really  interested in the carbon dioxide because those little bubbles then  expand when you heat it up and that's what makes bread rise. And that  was an open fermentation, as you can guess, like in making wine.</p>
<p>People  like to have a closed system so that, for example, a lactic acid  bacteria doesn't get in and turn your whole set of grapes into something  that would be sour. Sour wine. So that's where we'll stop today, the  most ancient of these energy-producing things. Again, you don't have to  memorize all this, but I think, hopefully if you think about, you'll see  some really, really important concepts that are critical to  understanding how life works.</p>
<p>OK? See you on Wednesday. Happy Valentine's Day.</p>
