Transcript â€“ Lecture 28 

So, we're going to  finish now by just talking more about this amaz ing immune 
system we have, the adaptive immune system. As I said on Friday, this is really an 
astonishing recognition system that just plays a key role in us being able to survive 
in this world that's full of bacteria, and yeast, and fungi, and viruses, parasites. 
There are things just all the time trying to do us in, and the reason we don't 
succumb is because we have this amazing immune system. And there are several 
features about it which I summarized the other day. One is its diversity. It has this 
incredib le ab ility to recognize entities, including things that are synthesized in a lab 
that had never been seen on Earth before. It's amazing in terms of that side of it. 

Coupled with this is this incred ible specificity. As I indicated the other day, for 
example, if it was seeing a benzene ring with a methyl on  it, it might be able to 
recognize this, but it could tell the difference from having the methyl over here. It's 
got that level of sophistication. In spite of that, in spite of the fact that  it can 
recognize everything else, it's able to avoid self recognition, which is a bit of a trick if 
you think about it, that you have a system that's ab le to see essentially anything, 
includ ing things that never existed before. 

And how does it avoid seeing a ll of our molecules, and all the many, many things 
that makes us up? So, it has to be ab le to tell self from non-self. And then, I a lso 
talked about this memory aspects of the immune system, that if you get exposed to 
a virus or bacterium or something, but the first immune response is relatively weak. 
But then if you get subsequently exposed, you get a very powerful response. And 
that's the principle of a vaccine. If you think someone is going to be exposed to 
chickenpox but they haven't had it, if you could somehow elicit the initial response 
without making them sick by using a killed virus or something like that; polio is one 
of the examples you hear about in the paper right at the moment. 

Then, if someone does encounter that virus or that bacterium, because that's second 
response, it's very quick and it's very powerful, and that's what vaccines are all 
about. So, the issue, I guess, today is how does that happen? And this is one of 
these amaz ing insights into biology that's come by an app lication of all these tools, 
recombinant DNA, and sequencing, and a ll the fancy sort of things we've been 
talking about in the past few lectures. So, the first part I need to let you know, is 
there are two parts to this immune response, or two kinds of responses. 

One's ca lled the humora l response and one's called the cellular response. And this 
takes p lace in the plasma of your b lood. So, in the liquid part of the blood if you spin 
down the red cells and the white cells, what you're left w ith is the p lasma. And, what 
this humoral response response does, it's able to target bacteria, viruses, proteins. 
And the recognition is done by a special kind of protein ca lled antibod ies. 

And I'll tell you about that in just a moment because they're a very important class 
of protein in this Earth. And the cellular immune response is carried out by a special 
kind of white b lood cell. For this lecture I think I'll just abbreviate those as WBC if I 

need it. What this targets is not the actua l pathogen itself. But it targets cells that 
are infected w ith a virus or a bacterium, etc. 

and that might seem to be even a little bit more of a trick. It's hard enough probably 
to figure out how to take something that's an entity like a virus that's floating around 
your blood and figure out how to find something that binds to it. What do you do if 
the thing's gone into one of your own cells and it's hiding out in their rep licating in 
the same way that, let's say, a phage does or something like that How do you see 
one of your own cells that's been infected by something like that? And there is a 
special type of cells ca lled cytotoxic T cell that's very important. 

It's often abbreviated as that. So let me first say a word about antibodies. These are 
proteins that consist of four polypeptide cha ins. Two of the chains are bigger. So 
they're ca lled heavy chains. There's two of those. And there are two chains that are 
sma ller, so  those are usua lly called light chains. So, there's four of them a ltogether. 
And, ignoring secondary structure and stuff for the moment, let me just sort of give 
you an idea of how these are la id out. 

These are the two heavy cha ins. And these are joined together by d isulfide bridges. 
You remember disulfide bridges? If you had two cystines they can  form a cova lent 
bond between them under oxid izing cond itions. So, those heavy chains are locked 
together. They're actua lly physica lly covalently joined. In fact, there's the light 
cha ins here. So, this is the light. And this part up here is highly variable between 
different antibodies. And the part down here is constant between antibodies. 

And it's this huge amount of variability that the body produces many, many, many 
types of antibod ies, and then figures out which ones will work to find the particular 
entity it's trying to recognize. And  I'll come back and tell you in a moment how that 
is done. There  is a diagram of what I showed you, but of course these are proteins. 
They have three-dimensional structures, and so if you were to look at them w ith the 
secondary structure show ing, you can see the different, especially here, a  lot of beta 
sheets should be leaping out at you. Now, the part where the recognition  is done is 
up at this end. 

So, it's essentia lly right here. And here's a little movie. You could see how the thing 
looks in three d imensiona l space. You see the part that's over on the left at the 
moment; that's the light chain and the b lue chain is that part of the heavy chain 
complex w ith the light chain. And here is the, it's been tilted up this way so this is 
the yellow and blue part you were looking at And the recognition pocket is right at 
the end of that. 

And at this picture, it's show ing how a particular protein was shown in red. This is an 
anti-body that can very, very precisely recognize that particular protein. You can't 
really tell it from the three-d imensiona l shape shown on the left because it just 
shows the secondary structure. But, if you could see the full space filling model, 
you'd be amazed. The surfaces are absolutely complementary. It goes back to one of 
those principles I've said over and over and over aga in that so much of biology 
works by having comp lementary surfaces. 

And there's a little movie you could see how this thing is setting up there at the top. 
So, these antibodies are produced by a special type of what are ca lled B cells. These 
are cells that play roles in the humora l part of the immune system. And they're 

called plasma cells. And each p lasma cell makes one particular antibody. And that's 
it. 

So you have many different types of p lasma cells, but each one only expresses one 
particular gene that encodes one particular antibody. So, for years, this is something 
that people struggled with just conceptually. They could sort of calculate that there 
were so many antibod ies that if your entire genome was nothing but antibody genes, 
we still wouldn't have enough DNA to account for a ll this ability to recognize things. 
So, some other principle had to be  involved. 

And there are all sorts of speculations about what it was. I had shown you, I'd 
managed to not get Bob Horvitz's thing on here, but this then, who is our fourth 
Nobel laureate, I've been sort of working through these. Susumu Tonegawa, who is 
in the cancer center, he's  in the biology department. He's a lso head ing, now, this 
Picower Center of learning and memory. So, since doing this work I'm telling you 
about on the immune system, he's gone to do some wonderful stuff more on the big 
problem of how we learn, and trying to get more molecular insights into that 
process. But what Susumu managed to figure out was that this variation and 
diversity in the immune system was, at its roots, a combinatorial sort of process. 

So, if you look in the DNA of a zygote, so that's the fertilized egg. We're just getting 
started with one of our cells. You've got a sing le cell. We're looking in the DNA to see 
what would happen. We come to the part of the DNA that's  involved in producing 
antibod ies. What he found was that if you looked along the DNA,  there were 
sequences that looked like part of the stuff that you'd  find in antibodies, but there 
were a whole series of them. So, he called this particular segment V1, V2, V3, up  to 
VN. There were a whole set of these basically side by side by side by side. There are 
about 300 of these  in humans. 

And then down the DNA a little b it he found another set of sequences that are a ll 
variations of each other. And these were given D1, D2, D3, D4, up to DN. And there 
are many of these. And then down the DNA a little farther, there were three other 
sections that were called joining segments. They were ca lled J1, J2, J3. And a little 
bit farther down there was a b lock of DNA coding the constant part of this 
polypeptide cha in that goes  into an antibody. And what Susumu Tonegawa was able 
to show, and this  led to the Nobel Prize. 

So, what happens during the development of these B cells is there are 
rearrangements. And a lot of DNA is thrown around. And the basic strategy is to 
take, if you think this as being column A, you take one from column A, one from 
column B, just p icking them randomly, one from column C over here, and throw 
away everything else. So you might have, for example, in one B cell, you might have 
V32, D15, J2, and then the constant region. 

And, what's in between is an intron that w ill be spliced out at the time that the 
gene's expressed. In another B cell, you might have V11, D22, J3. So, this 
rearrangement  is random in the sense of which V segment is chosen, which D 
segment is chosen, and which J segment. I don't mean that it all just joins together 
in a completely uncontrolled way. And then the rest of the DNA is deleted. So a 
consequence of this, is each B cell expresses only one antibody. 

It's true that they're dip loid, but only one chromosome is expressed. So that's how 
they avoid, you can imagine they might make to two. But they only make one. In the 

process, as you can see, that part is random. Furthermore, the joining events are 
what I think you could call sloppy. And this leads to even more variation than you 
would have imag ined simply looking at the number of segments. So, what this part 
of the process does is it explains why the system can be has the d iversity it has, 
because it's using this combinatorial process. If you know the number you can 
calculate how many possib le combinations there are. 

But then there's much more variation because when it joins together a little 
segments that are joined are done in a sloppy way so that the DNA sequence that 
shows up where the joints occur doesn't look like anything that was in the DNA at a ll. 
It was something like a polymerase that wasn't very fa ithful copying and making 
mistakes as it went a long. So what the system does, is it doesn't get you a response. 

It just explains why there is so much diversity, and why it is that I can go into the 
lab and synthesize a compound that's never been on this earth before, inject a rabb it 
to it, and the rabbit will probab ly produce an antibody that's able to recognize that. 
That's because it's made this whole set of them. And  they all are going to have 
somewhat different surfaces. And they make so many that one of those surfaces is 
going to  fit the molecule that I'm  testing. You can sort of see, that's only part of the 
trick. 

So, how do you now get an immune response? Because you've got millions of these 
things. But what you now need is a whole lot of one particular antibody that's going 
to recognize the pathogen that you are being exposed to. And the princip le of that is 
really cute. It's a process ca lled clona l selection. And  the idea is that each B cell 
displays a samp le of its antibody on  its surface. 

So, we might think of it this sort of way, that after this process is through we have 
one B cell. Of course, these are way out of proportion. The cells would be huge, and 
these would be molecules. So, they're sma ll. But here would be an antibody that can 
recognize squares, say, this one would have an antibody that could  recognize 
triangle. This one would have an antibody that could recognize a semicircle and so 
on, millions and millions of different shapes. And these cells don't divide, though. 
They've been made, and they just sit there. And then, when you stimulate them w ith 
an antigen, and I used that word the other day, an antigen is just anything that w ill 
elicit an immune response. It could be a piece of a foreign protein, carbohydrate, 
just about anything that's a small molecule you've made  in the lab. But let's say we 
exposed now this individua l to an antigen, which in this case can fit into that 
receptor. 

And what happens, then, this one becomes stimulated to divide. So what we have 
now is this B cell that has this antigen stuck into its binding pocket on the samp le of 
its antibody. And then, the cells d ivide and they give rise to two populations. They 
give rise to the p lasma cells, which are very short- lived, on the order of a few days. 
And what these do, so they would  look like this, what they do is secrete antibod ies 
into  the p lasma. So what you end up with, then, are a lot of these antibod ies that 
have exactly the specificity that the orig inal sample had on the outside of that 
particular B cell. 

This takes a few days. So back when we were ta lking about the d iscovery of DNA, I 
was telling you about Streptococcus pneumonia, and you get infected by the 
Streptococcus. And there would be this period of five or six days where this person 
was very sick, and then either they'd survive or they didn't survive. If they survived, 

they'd been able to mount an immune response and make these antibodies before 
they got killed by the bacteria. And the reason it takes a few days is when you start 
out there could be just one B cell that's able with an antibody, makes an antibody 
that is capab le of recognizing the capsule. Maybe there are a few. 

Anyway, but they were very, very tiny number, and there were probably a lot of 
bacteria. So what had to happen, then, is that the orig ina l cell or sma ll number of 
cells that could  recognize the Streptococcus had to be amplified. They had to make a 
lot of p lasma cells that have the potential to make the antibody, and then they had 
to secrete the antibody into the p lasma. And I'll tell you in just a minute some of the 
strateg ies that that uses to help kill the pathogen. 

And the other population, just before I go on there, are what are called memory 
cells. There's not as many of these made, but they're very long-lived. And so, what 
they have is exactly the same capacity to make the same antibody, but they're not 
actively divid ing. They'll just sit there, float around in your b loodstream, and  then if 
you get a second exposure to the antigen, you get a very fast and strong response 
because the selection  for finding the cells that had antibodies that can recognize the 
antigen has already been done. And there's a lready a  few of them around, and then 
after you do that then you're ab le to make, once aga in, the b inding of the antigen 
stimulates these guys to start divid ing. 

They make a lot of plasma cells. And going back to the principal of vaccination, your 
first response is fa irly modest. But if you get a second  response, what you're doing 
now is the memory cells are already there. They have the specificity for recognizing 
the antigen in question. And you can make a whole lot of them. So, if you had 
chickenpox when you were little, you have memory cells that know how to recognize 
the chickenpox virus. And then when your kid gets chickenpox like mine did, I d idn't 
get sick because I had memory cells that were able to recognize that. OK, so what 
happens if you get an antibody? How does this help the organism, or in our case 
someone like you or me, avoid getting sick? So there are a coup le of strategies. 

One we might think of is bind and block. For example, you are a virus and you get 
covered by antibod ies. Viruses: it's exactly the same logic as bacteriophage, except 
that instead of affecting a bacteria l cell a virus would be infecting one of our cells. 
And as the virus has receptors or something, it has to recognize something on my 
cell, in order to attach and then to inject its DNA. So if we've got an antibody sitting 
here, then it can't find its way to the host cell. 

And then, there are a coup le of other ways. They can target for destruction. And 
there's basically two ways. There's something called the complement system, that if 
it is ab le to recognize, say, the bacterial cell and their antibodies are sticking to the 
outside, what the complement system does is it's ab le to make little pores in the 
membrane of the pathogen. And I think one of the things I hope you will remember 
is that one of the secrets of life is that we have to keep that membrane around 
there. 

We have to keep a ll of our insides in, and the rest of the world outside. We have 
hydrogen ion grad ients across the membrane. So, if you want to kill a cell and you, 
say, insert a protein that has a little hole and  it, and that thing sits and sticks in the 
membrane, that cell is dead. It can't ma intain an ion grad ient, and things can leak 
out through the hole. So that's one of the ways of killing it. 

The other ways are macrophages. These are a type of white b lood cell, as well, are 
very good at recognizing bacteria that have antibodies stuck to the outside. And  in 
fact, that was the principle of that. We have the Streptococcus, and we have the 
capsule. And you may remember that little movie I showed of a white blood cell that 
was trying to eat it, and it couldn't get hold of the thing, whereas we saw another 
example where a bacterium without a capsule, there was sort of principle I said is 
that the white blood cell was able to recognize the bacterium and then  it pinches it 
off inside of a membrane bubble. And  I sort of said at  least in princip le that there is 
another little bubble with poisons, and it brings it together so that you have the 
bacterium and the poison together inside of some intracellular compartment, so that 
macrophages know how to kill a bacterium if they bring it inside. 

The problem in the case of something like Streptococcus was being ab le to recognize 
it because it couldn't get hold of that capsule. So, those antibodies that guy made 
during that five day thing decorate the outside of the capsule because their 
specificity is to recognize the capsule and b ind to it. But a macrophage, even if it 
couldn't get hold of the bacterium w ith a capsule is ab le to ingest something that has 
antibod ies stuck on the outside. 

And once it gets inside, it can kill the bacterium. In fact, immunologists call this 
process opsinization, which is derived from the Greek words for seasoning, like 
putting sa lt on your food. And the idea was that when they were g iving that word, 
with these macrophages, which liked to eat bacteria, they have a little seasoning 
that they have these little antibodies decorating  their outsides. So here you can see 
it least in the humoral response how you generate a whole lot of diversity. Then this 
principle of what's ca lled clona l selection identifies a B cell that's able to make an 
antibody that can recognize the particular pathogen or molecule that you're being 
exposed to amplify that, make a lot of antibodies, and then  it can either just stick to 
the pathogen like a virus and mess it up that way, or it can decorate it if it's 
something like a bacterium, and then pull in a couple of other systems that are 
capable of killing the pathogen. 

I mean, it's an absolutely amaz ing system. It sounded  like science fiction when I first 
heard about it. 

When I heard peop le ta lking about it, everyone could see there was an information 
theory problem. How do you encode a ll that information with just this amount of 
DNA in a cell? Now we understand. And there's even another part that I'm leaving 
out here. But once this whole thing has been selected, there's another whole round 
of sort of refinement where the cells do kind of a very kind of loca lized mutagenesis 
one base pa ir at a time in the vicinity of this b inding pocket. And they're ab le to 
make, if they're g iven more time and more exposure to the antigen, they can make 
a better and better b inding surface until you begin to approach sort of the theoretica l 
maximum. 

Now, the T cell,  in this case this involves the cytotoxic T cells, and they have a 
specific recognition molecule on their surface. It's ca lled the T cell receptor. And in 
this case, it's attached. So, this is the membrane of the T cell. 

And this is the cytoplasm down on this side. There's a little b it of the protein that 
goes into that. And then there's an a lpha helix that goes through, and then a 
segment that comes up like this. And there's another cha in that does the same 
thing. So, there are two segments that span the membrane. This thing is anchored in 

the membrane. And then it's essentially the same princip le as w ith antibodies. 
There's a variable region, and there's a constant reg ion. And to a first approximation 
anyway the log ic by which the cell generates a huge, diverse set of T cell receptors is 
the same logic that underlies the generation of a whole lot of different antibodies by 
taking segments, joining them, p icking them randomly out of column A, column B, 
and then joining them together, sloppy joining a ll the other processes to increase the 
pool of d iversity. Now, what these B cells are ab le to do, then, these T cells are ab le 
to do is something quite remarkable. 

We have on our cells, this is, say, one of my cells, little sort of proteins that function 
as sort of display cases or something. And what they do is they show samples of all 
of the different proteins that are inside us at any g iven moment. Proteins are turned 
over, and chopped up, and things are recycled and so on. So there are always  little 
peptides, little p ieces of proteins around. 

And, the display case, if you w ill, has got a major histocompatibility comp lex, which 
is usua lly abbreviated as MHC because it's such an unwieldy name. And there are 
many, many alleles of MHC in the population, which means that we each have, for 
the most part, a sort of individua lly designed d isplay case for show ing these 
peptides. The property of these display cases, they take some little p iece of a protein 
just a  few amino acids  long, it b inds into the display case, and that sticks on the 
outside of our cell. And so we have a lot of these. And so on the surface of our cells 
are these little ind ividua lized MHC display cases show ing little samples of the 
peptides of the proteins from the proteins that are inside us. 

So, if everything is fine, all of the peptides that are in the display cases are our own. 
And I'll tell you in a minute why that doesn't cause a problem. But then if you get 
infected by a virus, and it injects DNA or its RNA inside of you and then starts to 
replicate, now you have some virus proteins that don't belong to you. They get 
chopped into pieces, and they begin to appear on these major histocompatibility 
display cases. 

So if you think here, this could be, perhaps, a  little p iece of, let's ca ll it self protein, it 
could be a little piece of my own DNA polymerase or something like that. And over in 
this one, let's say we have a little p iece of a vira l protein. So that's something that 
would not be normally there. So what this T-cell receptor does is it recognizes, so 
this is non-self or foreign. What the T-cell receptor does  is it recognizes these foreign 
peptides. 

But it does it in the context of the d isp lay case. Otherw ise the peptides would be 
floating around. So, in essence, the T-cell receptor, if this is a cytotoxic T cell it's 
able to see the ind ividual d isp lay case with a b it of vira l protein in it. And then it 
knows that it should kill that cell because it's got something in it that shouldn't be 
there. I mean, it's a bruta l but very effective strategy. If we applied it here, I go 
around if I found any of you had a cold, I could just take a gun and shoot you and it 
would cut down on the number of sick days for the rest of us because it wouldn't 
spread the  infection. But in essence, at a molecular level, that's the strategy. 

Try to  identify a cell that's got something inside  it that shouldn't be there, and then 
the cytotoxic T cells kill that. And let me just show you a couple of quick movies of 
this. At this point, these will be the last protein structures you're going to see from 
me, I think. Here's a representation of that T cell just as a cartoon as you see it in a 
textbook. Here it  is. This is the binding pocket up here. And there's a little tiny 

peptide, nine and amino acids from the HIV virus bound in here. Somebody did a 
crysta l structure, and was able to work that out. And, if you look at it in three 
dimensions, you'll see how beautifully this little binding pocket and the peptide lies in 
there. So that red part is the p iece of cha lk, and the other part is what I'm describing 
as my hand. 

It's not a bad analogy, actually, even on a structura l level. And then, here's another 
representation. This is sort of show ing the hand with a piece of peptide in it. And 
then the T cell is able to see this whole thing in recognize it. And, if you look at it in 
a structura l form, here's the little peptide. This is the part, the display case you're 
looking at. 

And here's the T cell receptor now  fitting down in seeing the peptide in the context of 
this major histocompatibility antigen. And aga in, these things are all beautifully 
complementary a three d imensiona l level. Again, at the heart of this is the principle 
of complementary surfaces fitting together that underlies so much bio logy. What's 
this? This  is a tumor cell. 

These are cytotoxic T cells that have recognized this tumor cell is doing something it 
shouldn't that a norma l cell wouldn't do. And it's attacking it, and it's killing them. 
So, not only does the cellular immune response help us against things like infections 
from virus and bacteria, it also will help prevent cancer. So obviously there must be 
some trick here to why we don't see our own peptides. This is the self versus non-
self And it's a  relatively simple principle. So, distinguishing self versus non-self  is a 
problem throughout this whole part of the immune system. And here's the princip le. 

During embryogenesis, the cell makes, the organism I guess, makes the assumption. 
I mean obviously it's not thinking about it. This is a way of understanding what's 
happening. It makes the assumption that no pathogens are present. Any B or T cell 
recogniz ing something must be recognizing itself. And so, it deletes those B and T 
cells. This process is given a name. It's ca lled education. And it happens in this organ 
called thymus. 

So, and then after b irth, then it sw itches. And now B and T cells, if they recognize 
something, the body makes the assumption it must be a pathogen. And it goes after 
it. We have this huge human disease where that goes awry: rheumatoid arthritis, or 
multip le sclerosis are cases where the self versus non-self recognition has broken 
down. OK, so for example multiple sclerosis, a very difficult disease, because there's 
a gradual deterioration of the nervous system. And what happens is the body of the 
person with that mounts an immune response against the sheath that covers the 
nerves, and then that sheath gets destroyed, and that the nervous system, 
somebody with multiple sclerosis, starts to break down. 

And so, if you lose this self versus non-self you get what's called an autoimmune 
disease. You may have heard that phrase. It's very important. It's a very tough thing 
if you have one of these. But that's what lies at the heart of it. And people still don't 
know, but there is certainly some evidence for some of these that are triggered by a 
bacteria l infection. 

So, it could be that perhaps maybe a bacteria l protein looked close enough to one of 
your own proteins, that somehow you got antibodies against the bacterium, and then 
it turned out it could a lso recognize something in your body. There are some other 
immune diseases you probab ly heard of, the baby in a bubble kind of thing. There 

are a  few peop le who were born who have no immune response at a ll because one of 
the basic pieces for doing those DNA gymnastics I ta lked about isn't there. Those 
people have no B cells or T cells. 

They d ie unless they are absolutely shielded  from everything else. And that's one of 
those cases when gene therapy, if you could get that gene  into that person, they'd 
have an immune system and they could live. There are other kinds of immune 
deficiencies that are less extreme, but nevertheless, people will be susceptib le to 
infection. The other one which I've already ta lked about, but now you can see in 
another context is AIDS, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. And I told you 
what the HIV virus does is it injects its RNA. That makes a DNA copy. It goes into 
protein. The cells that it affects our special type of T cell called T helper cells. What 
they are doesn't matter so much, but what's important to know is they're needed for 
both branches of the immune system. They p lay roles in the humora l response and 
cellular response. 

So, someone who gets infected with HIV, what happens is the virus is replicating in 
these helper T cells. And so their immune system is slow ly, slowly being knocked 
away. And the last thing, which I won't have time to ta lk about, but if you have an 
allergy, that's an overreaction of the immune system. So this is my last lecture. I've 
got to let you guys go. It's been a true pleasure to talk to you; A rea l honor to meet 
many of you. And many of you put a  lot of effort into those little answers. 

I really, really appreciate that. For those who'd  rather not be here, I hope that 
somewhere down the line when you're confronted with a medical situation dealing 
with your parents, your child, yourself, whatever it is, that some of the stuff that you 
heard will reemerge to help you w ith those decisions. And  I w ish you the best of luck 
for the rest of the course, and the rest of your careers at MIT and beyond. Thanks 
very much. And as I leave, too, I've had the pleasure of just having an incredib le 
teaching staff. 

I don't think you guys know how hard they work behind the scenes, but thanks to a ll 
of you for being w ith me.
