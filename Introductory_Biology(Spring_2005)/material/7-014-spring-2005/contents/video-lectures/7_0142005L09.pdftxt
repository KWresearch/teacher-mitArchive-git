7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 9 

So today we're going to continue our focus on DNA which I'm personally enthusiastic 
about at least in terms of being such a fascinating molecule. And I told you the story 
last time of how we actua lly came to understand that DNA was the genetic material. 
And I still see comments that, oh, God, a ll this stuff is not relevant to the exam. 
We're trying to construct the exams in ways that test whether you got the concepts 
and not just whether you memorized every term that you ran into in the textbook. 

So I'm hoping that you w ill see some greater purpose in why I'm trying to ta lk about 
some of this. And also I'm sure some of you will forget the details of transformation, 
of DNA replication we're going to go into as we sort of burrow into it over the next 
lecture or so, but what I am hop ing you may remember ten years from now, even 
those who don't go in biology, is how experiments are done, how rea l peop le do 
them. 

And that was partly what I was trying to tell you. And you guys are pretty good at 
figuring out the basic principle that someone had to somehow show that a DNA 
molecule in one organism could change some organism to have a new characteristic. 
And as I sort of told you w ith the work from Frederick Griffith. And then his initia l 
stuff wasn't devoted to that at all. 

It was trying to solve a very pressing problem which is dea ling with pneumonia in a 
pre-antibiotic era. And then the finding that he got, that this odd  result that 
something in a heat-killed extract could be transferred to a live bacterium sort of set 
things up for Avery and his colleagues after a number of years of work to make a 
very powerful argument that DNA was the genetic material. 

But, as I sa id at the end of  last lecture, that paper was published in the 1940s. And 
people didn't immed iately say oh, wow, DNA is the genetic material. Often, and we'll 
see it aga in with genetics, there's sometimes sort of the body of science the average 
person thinks about. Science needs to reach to a certa in state before an idea can 
take hold, even if there's evidence supporting it. 

Part of the problem was that chemists had isolated DNA. And the way they used to 
isolate DNA was rea lly rough on  it. Crack the cells open. And what happened, it 
would all get broken down into  little pieces of DNA. And people had worked out the 
basic chemical structure that it was the deoxyribose and how the things were joined 
together, but nobody had ever seen anything more than just these little p ieces of 
DNA. 

And there was a widely held conception that it was just an anonymous 
tetranucleotide of G, A, T and C. It wasn't clear why the cells made it, but it d idn't 
look like anything that could encode information. Whereas, as I said, something like 
proteins, those seem to be very different. And so the world wasn't quite ready for it. 
Another thing, and this came from one of the comments here, was someone sa id 
they didn't know bacteria could take up DNA  from the environment. 

And, in  fact, most bacteria can. It happens that streptacoccucci and some other 
bacteria at certain phases in their lifetime develop this capacity to take up DNA from 
the outside. G iven what I've told you about a membrane and how hard it is to get 
things across it, you could imagine it's not trivial to get a DNA molecule which is 
huge from one side to the other. So it doesn't normally happen. 

And what happens if you go into a lab and you're cloning something or other, and 
we'll talk about how to take a couple pieces of DNA and join them  together in a test 
tube and then put them back into a bacterium. If we put it into E. coli that doesn't 
normally take up DNA you'll find  that it's sort of basically black magic. You cook 
them up with some divalent cations at very high concentrations, you do temperature 
shifts and various things, or you g ive them a b ig jolt of electricity, and the next thing 
you know you get some DNA  inside. 

And it's not a very efficient process, but all you need is one molecule to get in one 
bacterium and then you're in business. So that was another reason that this wasn't 
accepted  right away. Because this was not a phenomenon that could easily be 
repeated w ith other bacteria. So it looked like it was something perhaps special to 
streptococcus. And what did rea lly change peop le's understand ing, or at least bring 
people to the understand ing that DNA could possib ly be the genetic material came 
about from the discovery of the actual structure of -- How the structure of DNA as a 
long molecule with comp limentary strands and the doub le helix, the little pictures I 
showed you with the base pa irs, which you know about, and how the two strands 
which now  I'm going to start emphasizing  run  in opposite d irections. 

We'll come back to that in a little bit, but the 5 prime to 3 prime direction is this way 
on one end and 5 to 3 on the other. And just remember back here that there's the 5 
prime carbon and that's the 3 prime carbon. So this is the 5 to 3 prime d irection of 
the strand. And then it tw ists up in 3-dimensional space to form this doub le helix. 
And you've seen that movie severa l times. 

So once that structure was discovered then people began to see how these could 
possibly encode information. It was clearly not just a tetranucleotide of G, A, T, Cs. 
But we didn't move immediately to that understanding. And today, aga in sort of 
trying to show you how biolog ical experiments are done and how they're done by 
real people, I want to just go on and tell you the key things that happened next. So 
someone who was very struck by the results of Avery when they came out was Erw in 
Chargaff who was at Columbia. 

And, in  fact, my colleague Boris Magasanik whose office is next to mine was a post-
doc in Chargaff's  lab. So I've got a neighbor of mine who worked w ith Chargaff. And 
Chargaff was very struck by this result from Avery and his colleagues that you could 
take DNA and put it in another organism. And here are a coup le of quotes from his 
writing. One that I liked. 

I've sort of had a sense of this  in my own research career, this kind of thing. "I saw 
before me in dark contours the beginning of a grammar of biology." He didn't rea lly 
know quite how it worked but he sort of sensed that somehow here where you could 
get down to the language that b iology was written. So he started some experiments. 
And I started w ith the conviction that if d ifferent DNA species exhibited d ifferent 
biolog ical activities there should exist chemica lly demonstrable d ifferences between 
deoxyribonucleic acids. 

So he was able to start just doing some simple chemical experiments to try and look 
at DNAs from a whole variety of sources and see what he could learn. And this was 
not at the structural level. This was just at the chemical level. But one thing he 
learned was that the base content of DNA, that's the A, G, C, T part of it varied 
widely between organisms. So this was what Chargaff found in his lab, key findings. 
And that was important because if DNA was just a molecule of GATC, just a 
tetranucleotide that every organism made then you'd expect to find the same base 
composition in a ll organisms. 

He didn't, so that finding essentia lly buried the monotonous tetranucleotide 
hypothesis. Another thing he found was that DNA was the same in different tissues -
- -- from the same organism -- -- but the proteins varied. And that's a characteristic 
you'd expect of something that was the genetic information from the cell that all cells 
have to have sort of the major blueprint. And if you had, even though proteins look 
like an attractive possib ility for that because they had so much variation, this kind of 
find ing wasn't consistent w ith it and it supported the idea that DNA was the genetic 
material. 

Well, the other thing he could do was he could measure the A, T, G and C content of 
all these d ifferent DNAs. And he noticed some similarities then. And he extracted out 
of that a coup le of generalizations. One was that if you looked at the ratio of the 
purines, those are the ones with the two rings, adenosine and guanidine over the 
pyrimidines, those are the ones w ith the single ring which were C and T, it was about 
one. 

Another thing he noticed was that the ratio of A to T was about one and the ratio of 
G to C was about one. Now, that was an important clue but it d idn't lead to any 
immed iate breakthrough, even though maybe now that you know the structure you 
can see, gee, if I had been there maybe I would have been smart enough to jump on 
that number. So instead the work that led to the structure of DNA now introduces a 
coup le of other characters who you've heard of a lot, Jim Watson and Francis Crick. 

At the time that Avery made his discovery reporting DNA was transformation, and 
Jim Watson described himself later as a precocious college boy in Chicago who was 
consumed by ornithology. So he was into bird watching. That's what he was excited 
about at the time Avery did his experiment. And Francis Crick at that point was a 
physicist, and he was in the British Navy designing Naval mines. 

So that's where those two p layers were at the time of Avery's results. So then both 
Francis Crick and Jim Watson ended up in Cambridge, Eng land about 1950. I think 
Crick got there around 1949 and J im Watson got there in 1951. Francis Crick was a 
grad student, 35 years old at the time. I'll show you pictures in a minute. 35 years 
old at the time and still working on his PhD. 

So he was a pretty elderly grad student, if you want to think of it that way. And Jim 
Watson was a young hot-shot. He had done his PhD working with Salvador Luria who 
was at Ind iana University at the time. Sa lvador Luria was one of the Nobel Laureates 
at MIT. He founded the Cancer Center, which is still here right across from the main 
biology building. And Jim was a very, very bright and brash young guy, and he had 
done his PhD with Salva and then he went to Cambridge as well. 

And the reason they both went to Cambridge was they were attracted by the power 
of x-ray crystallography. Now, I sa id a little work about that earlier, that if you take 

x-rays and you bounce them off a crysta l and then measure the diffraction pattern 
you can work backwards by Fourier transforms and whatnot to  figure out what the 
underlying crystal structure  is. For the purposes of this course the mechanics of how 
that's done, we don't have to worry about that right now. 

You just need to know that you can work backwards from the d iffraction pattern to 
figure out what the underlying structure was. And I told you, when I  introduced to 
proteins, that the first clues that there were these regions of secondary structure, 
alpha helices and beta sheets came because people saw characteristic reflections in 
these diffraction patterns of certain proteins. 

And I also told you the story of how L inus Pauling had gone to Oxford, had gotten 
sick and tired of read ing detective novels, started to try and expla in the refractions 
in a certain class of proteins and came up w ith a model for the alpha helix. And so 
that was the sort of thing that inspired Watson and Crick. They were both interested 
in how one could get the structure of DNA. Now, Cambridge also had a very good x-
ray crysta llogram group. 

And just in passing it's interesting as to why they d idn't come up w ith the structure 
of the alpha helix. There were two things. One was just lack of basic knowledge. I 
told you that the peptide bond,  if you remember I emphasized that you cannot rotate 
it because the electrons are distributed. Pauling was an outstanding chemist. He 
knew that fact. 

And the folks at Cambridge who were doing that didn't learn this until later, so their 
models were far less constra ined because they could have rotation around that bond. 
And the other one was just an experimental thing that the size of the photographic 
plates they used in the Cambridge lab were too sma ll in the sense that they missed a 
key reflection that Pauling knew about and they didn't know about. 

So this comb ination led to them being scooped by the other group. But nevertheless 
the group at Cambridge was absolutely outstand ing and at one of the top places in 
the world to do. And I showed you a coup le of pictures when I was showing you the 
transition state. Sort of what you get out of working backwards from these 
diffraction patterns is they can measure reg ions of electron density, and then you fit 
atoms or fit molecules to the patterns that you see. 

And if it's all working you can exp lain why there are bumps here. There's an oxygen 
here and so on. There's another one. This is an ATP that's bound actually in a pocket 
in a protein. But you can sort of see how beautifully the patterns of electron density 
deduced from  the x-ray crysta llography will match the chemical structures that we 
put on the board. So  that was the idea, they were going to work out the structure of 
DNA. 

Now, the thing about Watson and Crick, who at this point looked like this, they d idn't 
look inord inately distinguished. In  fact, Jim probably looked like, you've probably 
seen peop le who look approximately like that around MIT. He would have fit in right 
here and no one would have noticed. They were not actually x-ray crystallographers. 
They were just trying to model other peop le's data. And the best DNA 
crysta llography data was from a young woman Rosalind Franklin, who was working 
in London. 

A very somewhat uneasy a lliance w ith Maurice Wilkins. And in trying to read the 
history it's a b it comp licated because, at least some of what I've read, I think that 
when Rosa lind Franklin arrived at the  lab she was told  this DNA structure problem 
was hers. And Maurice W ilkins  in whose lab she was working was told that he was 
sort of working for her. So  there was a bunch of confusion in this. 

But,  in any case, Rosa lind Franklin was collecting crystallographic data. And Watson 
and Crick located some distance away in Cambridge were trying to come up w ith 
models that could expla in the structure of DNA. And they learned about Rosalind's 
data. And it was her data that they used to work out the basis, her crystallographic 
data that they used when they put together their structure. 

So if  it hadn't been for her they wouldn't have been able to make their discovery. So 
part of the reason I'm dwelling on this  is I think their d iscovery of the structure of 
DNA was arguably one of the great intellectua l advances of our time. It just opened 
doors. The whole field of molecular b iology became possible once people suddenly 
saw that DNA was complimentary strands. 

You could a lmost immediately see how you could copy genetic information. It la id 
the groundwork for what later turned out to be, you know, recomb inant DNA and 
everything else. So much of this pivots around this one d iscovery. And I think I 
wouldn't be doing justice to this finding, which you a ll have heard about for years 
and years, if I had let you walk away from here thinking this was too young geniuses 
who sat down in a room w ith some crysta llographic data and emerged with a 
structure that sort of changed  the course of the study of b iology. 

And, as you can see, changes our society and everything else. There are a couple of 
accounts of this, there are numerous accounts. One that I found pretty interesting is 
called "The Eighth Day of Creation," if you ever want to read an  interesting book on 
science. This was Horace Judson's effort to try and put together a history of this 
happening. 

And with a ll history he's ultimately -- You know, there are some judgment calls by 
the historian, but this one certainly he tried to be pretty fair-handed and even-
handed and he tried to get at the heart of what was going on. Watson wrote a book 
called "The Doub le Helix". Jim Watson's a very colorful character, quite brash 
particularly when he was younger, and that's reflected in this book. 

It's an interesting read. Probab ly more balanced point of view  for sure in "The Eighth 
Day of Creation". And there are now a lot of other books. But what I did, just to try 
and do this in about a minute or two, was I took a couple of the key things that 
happened during their adventure of trying to work out the structure of DNA and just 
kind of ran some of their missteps together, because even though this was a 
marvelous d iscovery it just didn't happen. 

So they started out, they were insp ired by Linus Pauling 's discovery of the a lpha 
helix. And I don't know if you can remember the story, but what Pauling decided to 
do when he was lying in bed and with a strip of paper trying to work out the 
structure that was g iving these reflections in the crystal structure, he said I'm going 
to start by ignoring the side chains. So that was a brilliant move  in the case of the 
alpha helix because he was then able to  figure out that that hydrogen bond between 
the carbonyl and the amino group, you could see how if you got helix going it would 

repeat at exactly the way that would g ive the reflections that were observed  in the 
crysta llography data. 

So that was how Watson and Crick sort of d id it. Linus Pauling had shown the way. 
So they decided they would ignore the side cha ins of DNA. So they started out by 
saying we won't consider the As,Ts, the Gs and  the Cs. Well, given what you know 
about the structure of DNA that was not a help ful move in trying to work out the 
structure of DNA. Another thing, for example, that happened was that J im Watson 
has no lack of self-confidence. 

And so  it turned out when he went to hear scientific talks he didn't take notes. And 
so he went to hear a talk on x-ray crystallography given by Rosalind Franklin, but he 
didn't quite remember the numbers right. He got the facts a  little jumbled, and he 
and Francis spent a while trying to design models to data that wasn't the right data. 
It was just not quite remembered right, so there was kind of an inefficiency there. 

And then Jim had a b ias almost to the end that the phosphate backbones they knew 
would somehow be on the inside and the bases would be on the outside of the 
structure. So if that's your sort of starting place then it's sort of hard. So Watson, 
excuse me, Francis Crick was beginning to suspect that maybe the bases were 
important. So he hired a young mathematician. And he said, "Can you see if you 
could work out whether there would be any chemical attraction between any pairs of 
bases?" And the young mathematician came back and said that he thought G might 
go with C and A with T. 

And g iven what happened here you might have thought that a light bulb would have 
gone off, but it d idn't. And, in fact, Chargaff visited them and the light bulb went off 
for nobody. And, in fact, Chargaff wasn't a terrib ly big fan of what Watson and Crick 
were trying to do. So the p ieces are piling up but still not there. Then a b ig 
experimental advance came from Rosa lind Franklin. 

And that was she d iscovered that the DNA that they had been diffracting was 
actually a mixture of two  forms. So there were actually two structures in the mix 
that were contributing to the diffractions. She was ab le to separate out the two kinds 
of DNA, DNA-A and DNA-B she called it. And so now this gave a much clearer 
diffraction pattern, and that's the diffraction pattern that she saw. 

And Watson and Crick managed to get a look at this data. And it's a little 
complicated how that happened, but Crick rea lized a lmost right away that there were 
two strands running in opposite d irections. So he know knew  it was 5 to 3 in one 
direction and 5 to 3 in the other d irection like that. So you might have thought they 
were home-free, but no. Jim Watson immed iately built a model that paired like w ith 
like, A w ith A, T with T, G w ith G. 

They wrote it up and they were ready to submit the paper. And they gave a 
presentation to their colleagues at the lab in Cambridge. And they were shot down. 
And one of the key things was they learned the chemical fact that most of the 
textbooks were wrong at that time in the way that they depicted the structure of 
guanine. If you look in your textbook, excuse me, here. So if you were to look  in a 
textbook today you'd see guanine like this, but there is another way you could draw 
this. 

So this you may remember when we were talking about phosphoenolpyruvate that 
this is an enol form and this is a keto form. And  this is the way most of the textbooks 
were showing guanine at the time. So they were looking at the structure of guanine 
in textbooks. And if you were trying to work out schemes for putting bases together 
you can see what's going on up here would be very different. 

And if we have a hydrogen here versus if we have an oxygen, if you're trying to say 
make hydrogen bonds at that particular position, I think all of you understand 
hydrogen bonds well enough to see how that would throw you off. So once that 
insight came, once they learned that then the rest of the structure came pretty fast. 
And there's a movie about this. One of the nice things in it was sort of trying to 
recreate the experience where I think it was Watson who was shuffling these base 
pairs around. 

And he suddenly realized that you could set up base pa irs with A and T and w ith G 
and C, and when you  looked at them you could see they were geometrically exactly 
the same shape. You could just take the shape of the G and C pa ir and lay it right 
down on the A and T pa ir. And then you could see how you could build either a G-C 
or an A-T pa ir into the repeating structure of this DNA and it would be compatible. 

So they built a model and they thought, we can  just hit the lights for a second here 
maybe. I just want you to see what that first model  looked like. It looks like 
something you could hack together in a chemistry  lab. They had the bases cut out of 
metal. And you can see just, you know, here the retort sort of stands using 
chemistry and various clamps that you would use for clamp ing a flask or something if 
you're doing a chemical lab. 

That's the stuff that they were using to put the model together. And they published 
then a paper in Nature that told about this result. That's the entire paper reporting 
the structure of DNA. And maybe you can see there's a little hand-drawn doub le 
helix right there that captures the elements. That is the paper, and that was in the 
journa l Nature. And it had in it, right near the end, one of the coyest sentences in 
the scientific literature. 

They d idn't want to go into all the details that  if you had an A paired with G and G 
paired with a C and you pulled them apart then you could replicate the molecule by 
redoing it. So a ll they sa id was, "It has not escaped our notice that the specific 
pairings we expostulated immediately suggests a copying mechanism for DNA." So 
this is a picture of Jim Watson wearing short pants at Cold Spring Harbor in 1953 
reporting this structure of DNA. 

Cold Spring Harbor is on Long Island. It's been one of the Meccas for molecule 
biology since the 1940s. They have a famous symposium once a year. The top ic 
changes every year and  rarely repeats. And it was at one of those symposia -- This 
was the year that they d iscovered the structure of DNA. And there was Watson. So 
two years ago they had another meeting, a special meeting just exactly this time of 
year. 

It was in February within a coup le of days of right now. So I gave this lecture and I 
showed the student in the class that this year, I said here's a picture of J im Watson 
displaying the structure. They're having a meeting 50 years later in 2003. And I'm 
going down there. I'm asked to give a talk. And  I'll come back and I'll tell you what it 
was like. So I gave my  lecture. I dashed out to the airport. 

I hoped on the plane. I went down and  I registered. They gave me, you know, the 
stuff to get into my room, a little envelope w ith the key card and things. And I went 
up to my room. And I took out the key card. And what d id I find myself looking at? 
The same p icture I had shown to the class just a couple of hours earlier. Here's 
another picture of J im the way he looked at the time when he made this amazing 
discovery. That's Sa lvador Luria who I mentioned. 

I tell you about him in a subsequent lecture. I was at another meeting a few years 
earlier where some of the old-timers were razzing each other, and someone showed 
this picture. And then they got up and they gave it a title. And that was "Picture of a 
Man P icking His Own Pockets". So they would tease each other a lot. And  I'm hoping 
maybe you'll get a chance to hear a little bit more about that soon. 

This is what J im Watson looks like now. I asked  to get a picture taken just so you 
could see he's still around and is very active and still very controversial. This doesn't 
make much of a difference. Here's a p icture of Watson and Crick a little b it later just 
sitting out on a porch in Cold Spring Harbor. It's sort of right on the edge of a bay 
down there in a very relaxed kind of atmosphere that still permeates molecule 
biology research to this day. 

Francis Crick just d ied last July at the age of 88, so we've just lost the link to one of 
the two people who did this amazing experiment. OK. So I want to then set things up 
for the details of DNA replication. So there was a basic principle that came across 
from this that you could see how this could work, that DNA was sort of like having a 
photograph and a negative. And so the information is actually in there twice. 

It's just in d ifferent forms. And when I tell you about DNA repair in another lecture 
you can maybe see a lready how useful that is because  if you damage one strand 
you're not really out of luck because you've still got the information in the other 
strand. And you could probably, on the basis of that, device a repa ir strategy if you 
thought about it. But more importantly for DNA replication finally gave an insight to 
this thing that had been vexing people forever. 

If you had to have all this information  for making a cell, and every time a cell d ivided 
and you saw how it can happen pretty quickly w ith something like a bacterium of 
yeast, how could you accurately copy all that DNA, excuse me, a ll that genetic 
information? How is it stored? How could it be done? And once you saw ah, it's just a 
matter of separating the strands, and if there's an A there put a T there, if there's a 
C you put a G and so on, was a huge breakthrough. 

But that then d idn't tell peop le how DNA rep licated or even if this is the mechanism. 
You can actua lly come up w ith a ll kinds of models for how you could replicate things 
based on this principle, including crisscrossing between strands and all sorts of 
things. The predominant model and perhaps the simp lest one was called semi-
conservative. And it thought of the problem in this kind of way, that if you had two 
strands of the original DNA molecule and then you pulled them apart that one of the 
strands here would become one of the strands of the daughter, and then the new 
one would be here and the same thing would happen on the other side. 

And then if you did it aga in this thing would happen again w ith a new strand. This 
time the skinny strand here would be like this,  the skinny strand here would be like 
this, and then this one again. We'd have one that was nearly synthesized plus one of 

the originals. So this model was one of the simp lest because it kept this strand intact 
throughout the whole process while some of the other models had them being 
patched back together, all based on the idea that A pa irs with T and G pairs with C. 

But proving that this was the correct model was then another important advance. 
And that was done by Frank Stahl and Matt Messelson. Actua lly, I think I'll skip  this 
for right now. Matt  is a professor up at Harvard, just up at Harvard Square not very 
far from here, still very active. Frank Stahl is a professor out in Oregon. He's still 
active. 

So one of the d ifferences about this course is a lot of the things I'm telling you about 
-- And this is pretty old stuff right now, right, molecule b iology. The people who did 
these are still around and very active. This is most of modern biology is a pretty 
young science, and many of the major characters are still running around and w ith 
us today. So, anyway, what Matt and Frank were at Caltech. And they, with a bunch 
of other students had an apartment. 

And they were sitting around trying to work out a way to figure out this model. And 
they came up with an idea, and that was to see if you could differentia lly label what 
we might call "old DNA" and the "new DNA" here. And since it's chemically the same 
stuff it's a b it of a trick. How do you tell old DNA from new DNA? So their idea was 
since nitrogen comes in two d ifferent isotopes, N14 which is the common one and 
N15 with is one mass heavier, that maybe you could start out w ith the DNA,  for 
example, grown  in N15. 

And then when you started  replication sw itch to N14. And then you'd be able to tell, 
if you could separate these molecules on the basis of their density since the one with 
the N15 would be heavier than the one with the N14, then maybe you could work 
this out. And the story goes, this has been written, they were sitting arguing about 
this, or talking about this idea at the tab le. 

And it was a good idea but there was a prob lem. And  that was how could you 
separate the two kinds of DNA based on their density? So they had a piece of 
fingerna il and they were trying to see whether they could get it to float by d issolving 
more and more sugar. And they figured if they added more and more sugar the 
water would get denser and denser so the could float the fingernail. 

And they weren't ab le to do it. But a ll chemists made a periodic, probably some 
places here at MIT, they had a periodic chart right in their living room. So they went 
and they looked. And then they looked at sod ium. And they went down the periodic 
table and then they saw cesium. And thought maybe, you know, if you took a 
solution of cesium chloride and you put it a centrifuge and you spun rea lly hard then 
you'd get a grad ient of varying concentrations, of slightly different concentrations of 
cesium chloride. 

And that they could tune that to a  range that would d iscriminate between the heavy 
and the lighter forms of DNA. So the experiment they did is known as the Messelson-
Stahl experiment. But, as I say, these are names that come from real people. And 
the idea was pretty simple. They grew the bacteria  for many generations -- -- in N15 
med ium. This is the so-called heavy or H isotope -- -- of nitrogen. 

And then at time equa ls zero in their experiment, when they're ready to start the 
experiment they switched to medium with N14, which we'll think of as the light or 

the L  isotope. And then they isolated DNA -- -- after let's say increasing  rounds of 
replication that you could tell simply by measuring how much DNA was in your 
bacteria l culture when the bacteria had doubled their DNA. And this is the data  they 
got which looks something like this. 

In fact,  in this case the b lackboard representation is pretty close. So this is cesium 
chloride. And it has been centrifuged very hard so that there's a gradient now that's 
light at the top and a little heavier at the bottom of the grad ient. There's a little more 
cesium chloride per ml here then there is there in the tube. And  I'll just give us three 
little sort of reference marks here. 

So what they found when they started was that all of the DNA was at that position 
down at the heavy end. And then this is after one generation. So the DNA has now 
doubled. What they found was that all the DNA was now at this intermediate 
position. And after two generations or two DNA replications they now found that 
some of the DNA was here, some of the DNA was there. 

And if they went to three or more what they saw was they began to p ile stuff up 
there. And I think most of you could probably make the connection between that 
data and that picture that I've got up there. This is the heavy-heavy DNA. This is the 
heavy-light. So this would be heavy-heavy, heavy- light, light-heavy. After one round 
it will all be here. After two we have heavy-light, but this one is light- light, light-
light, light-heavy. 

And so now we've got light-light, the heavy-light, no heavy-heavy  is ever going to 
show up again. And  the longer you do this the more you'll get the  light accumulating. 
A very simp le experiment done by rea l peop le but enormously powerful because now 
it showed that this basic idea, you have the photograph and negative, you pull them 
apart and copy them was right. So at this point you begin to see why data of Avery's 
that before people had trouble accepting, all of a sudden now it was rea lly you 
needed a CYD and A was the genetic materia l. 

And this is what sort of ushered in this great burst of molecular b iology. So in the 
next lecture what we're going to start doing now is once you, this is all great, but 
once we start figuring out how to replicate it we're going to have to get down to 
enzymes and b iochemical steps. And there are some formidable challenges to 
replicating DNA, and it's also awesome. I'll tell you at the beg inning of next lecture 
how much DNA we have and just how accurate it is. 

It always b lows me away. I'll see you then. Take care.
