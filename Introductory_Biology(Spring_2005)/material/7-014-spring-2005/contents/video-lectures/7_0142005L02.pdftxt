Transcript â€“ Lecture 2 

Today we're going to start get into at least the nitty-gritty stuff of the course. I think 
a point I want to, just to give you a very broad perspective apart from why b iology is 
interesting, I want to talk about just very briefly how we study b iology. I sort of 
talked about it the other day by sort of the levels at which we could do it, from the 
biosphere all the way down to the molecular level. But there is another way of 
looking at  it. 

And I just want to remind you of what I sa id the other day. Biology is an 
experimental science What we know or think we know at the moment is because of 
people having made observations, designed hypotheses, tested them and so on. And 
what you're seeing is sort of the sum of the current state of human knowledge when 
I'm ta lking to you right now. There are various,  two sort of major d isciplines that 
have been used to get at how b iological function works. 

As you'll see, the main actor for many of the things that happened inside of cells and 
in living organisms are proteins. And we'll be ta lking about what those are and their 
structures in some deta il at the next thing. But the information is not coded in the 
proteins. The information for coding everything  that's in a cell is in units called genes 
which are made of, as you probably all know, DNA. 

So there have been, classica lly there were two approaches towards studying biology 
in detailed ways. One was the approach of the b iochemist who basically took 
whatever it was, put  it in a whirling b lender or something, and  ripped everything into 
little pieces. Sort of like taking the alarm clock and shaking it so hard all you've got 
is all the little b its. And once you got it into all  little bits then you can purify a little 
thing like a spring or a little wheel or something and try then to figure out what that 
does in the context of the cell. 

You can get very deta iled information. And this is in a sort of trivial way the science 
of, discipline of b iochemistry. Geneticists take a different sort of approach. And what 
they do is they take the living organism and look for a variant where there has just 
been one sing le change in that whole organism and they study its properties. And 
what you learn from that is physiolog ica lly relevant information. 

And if you broke up a car and purified the ashtray you could postulate that that was 
really important for the car. But if you made a mutant that was missing the ashtray 
and it still ran, you know, you'd learn that that wasn't what was correct. And one of 
the really powerful things that people could only do in very rare instances for a long 
time was to unite the kinds of observations that biochemists made with the kinds of 
observations geneticists made. 

And the exp losion in know ledge that's happened over the  last couple of decades, 
probably, well, since probably 1975 when recombinant DNA came in, was a whole 
new  realm of sort of a general discipline we call molecular biology that allowed us to 
clone genes, to sequence them, to many of the things we'll be ta lking about. But one 

of the rea l powers in looking at this sort of way of thinking about how we study 
biology is that it suddenly enabled one to put these two sorts of things together. 

If you were a biochemist and you purified a protein and you found out a chemica l 
property that it had and you wondered what it d id in the cell, you could sequence the 
protein and deduce what some of the DNA sequence was,  find the gene, disab le the 
gene in the organism,  look and see if your idea was right. Or vice versa, if you were 
a geneticist and you found a mutant that had an interesting property and you 
wondered how  it was working then you could clone the gene, look at the protein and 
try and figure  it out. 

And that's partly way since about 1975 there has just been this absolute upheaval in 
our know ledge of biology. And we'll be ta lking about all of these disciplines here as 
we go through the course. Three or four of you were honest enough to say I'd rather 
be anywhere on earth but in this class. I'm a senior. I rea lly didn't want to be here. 
And I sa id to you the other day if you'll come I'll give you the best I have to try and 
show you why I think it's exciting and why it's so relevant to you and your life as you 
go looking  forward to moving on with your careers and your family and everything 
else. 

However, even if you're not interested in this course, don't get caught in the trap 
because we're not going to be doing d ifferentia l equations that it's easy. Part of the 
reason biology is hard is each one of these disciplines has a different kind of 
thinking. And to be very effective  in biology right now you have to be able to think 
like a chemist, how bonds are formed and broken and what's reasonab le. 

You need to be ab le to think in 3-d imensiona l structures because everything happens 
in 3-D and biology is very much about fitting shapes together. Genetics is more like 
probability and statistics. Some of those logic games that you sort of used to try and 
do. It's more like that. PCR is, I don't know, recombinant DNA, all this sort of stuff is 
sort of a strategy kind of game. 

So you'll find, as you go through this course, that there maybe some things that are 
easy and some that are difficult. But for you, easier or difficult, you'll need to do a lot 
of different thinking. And then, at the moment, you cannot do biology anymore by 
just being a b iochemist or just being a geneticist. You could in the old days, but now 
you've got to do  it all. 

So where we're going to start right now w ill be with biochemistry. And just before I 
do that I just want to show you -- Let's see. I wonder if we're going to be ab le to see 
these slides with that light on. I think we'll see if we can do this. So the green 
fluorescent protein, thanks,  that's great. The green fluorescent protein, which we 
showed you the other day, is a protein. And we're going to be ta lking about that. 

And you'll see it's got structures. You've got these sorts of sheets and you'll see little 
helices. And in a couple of days you'll know what this is a ll about. But I wanted to tell 
you a couple of things just before I get into this. This actually was, I showed you 
that little Barney thing to try to emphasize that if you looked at evolution that way, 
you can see most of it was at the  level of single cells, and that's why things are so 
common when you get down to the cellular and molecular level. 

I've actua lly done that demo one other place, and that was after, I'm an American 
Cancer Society research professor, and they asked me to give a ta lk for the 50th 

anniversary of the Illinois D ivision of the American Cancer Society on the importance 
of basic research. And it was after dinner, 500 people in tuxedos and evening gowns 
and bottles of w ine, and they kept shortening my time. 

And finally I had ten minutes to get up there in my tux and tell them about the 
importance of research, basic research. And  I finally decided maybe what I could do 
is help them understand why when they gave money to cure cancer b iologists went, 
ah, signed this one off, and studied a ll these other organisms, fruit flies and 
everything. So I did this little demo. 

So I was up on the stage at the Sheraton holding the Barney and the dinosaur doing 
what you saw me do here. And I thought of briefly about putting my tux on just to 
kind of, you know, give a  little zip to the extra lecture, but decided not to because I'd 
get chalk all over it or something. So if you think I look stup id doing this, you know, 
my cats thought I was absolutely an idiot afterwards. 

They looked very, very puzzled as to what was going on. OK. So I'm going to start 
talking in a coup le of minutes about cova lent bonds, and you're going to roll your 
eyes upwards and think I've heard about that since I was a baby, or some of you will 
think that. But I just want to keep, you've got to understand something about how 
the parts that are used in biology are built or it won't make sense. And so just to sort 
of give you something to sort of keep you going here, I want to sort of foreshadow a 
coup le of things that are coming. 

Here's an examp le of what happens w ith genetics. This is a sing le mutation in one 
gene of an individual. This woman has what's known as Werner syndrome. That's 
what she  looked like as a teenager. That's what she looked like at age 48. That's one 
of these mutations that causes advanced ag ing. And people are working very hard 
on what that, you know, trying to understand aging. 

During your time at MIT, there are going to be some, there a lready have been some 
amazing discoveries in the last five years, and it's going to be a time of exp losive 
growth. But that's just one change. And it offers a huge clue as to why we age. 
Here's another example. These are peop le who have a human condition called 
Xeroderma P igmentosum. And this was the way they used to look before we 
understood it. They have a deficiency in handling damage to their DNA that's caused 
by sunlight. 

So if they went out  in the sunlight once they'd get skin cancer. You can see they get 
skin lesions and everything else. It was due to a defect in just one gene. And it took 
out an important kind of DNA repa ir. Now they know how it works. The kids who do 
this only go out at night. They go to summer camp at night. They ca ll them "Children 
of the Moon". 

They look norma l and they don't get skin cancer, but they have to live a kind of 
special life because of this problem. And people are working on fixing that. That's the 
sort of thing that can come out genetics. Sing le change, absolutely dramatic affect. 
You can sort of make inferences that something important is broken  in that ind ividual 
because the rest of us don't have this problem. 

The b iochemists, you know Watson and Crick, and we'll talk more about their 
structure of DNA. But DNA has to get replicated. In fact, just in the last couple years 
we now know that's what's wrong w ith this person is that they're lacking a specia l 

DNA copying machine that  is able to copy over strands of DNA that have damage in 
them that's caused by sunlight. It's got a very sort of flexible active site. 

It can accommodate the bulkiness of this UV induced lesion. And so here's a case 
where we've now united our understanding of that disease at the ultimate 
biochemica l molecular level and  the high  level human syndrome. So that's kind of 
one thing to sort of keep you going. OK. So here's a cell. That's the fundamenta l unit 
of life. I said the other day remember cells carry out metabolism. 

They do regulated growth. They do reproduction. That's what makes them d ifferent 
from just a bag of proteins and nucleic acids and things. And we could think about 
cells at a couple of d ifferent levels. We could think about them  in terms of their 
atomic composition. I guess we can. Let's see. And if we think about it that way it's 
not particularly exciting. Hydrogen is about 60%, oxygen is about 20%, carbon is 
about 12%, nitrogen is about 5%, and then there's a whole lot of other stuff present 
at lower levels, phosphorus, sulfate, magnesium, manganese, selenium, etc. 

This isn't a particularly help ful way to think about cells. This  is perhaps a more useful 
way, and that's to think about it in terms of molecular composition. And we're about 
80% water. Virtually all living organisms, more or less the same, 80% water is what 
our cells are made up of. And of the rest of them, there are four major classes of 
macromolecule, large b iological molecules that make up the rest of cells. 

And that's what we're going to be focusing on in a little bit. There are proteins, which 
I've already mentioned today, and that's about 50% of it. Nucleic acids, that's DNA 
and RNA, we'll say that's about 15%. Carbohydrates, which we'll be talking about 
today. L ipids about 10%. And there is a bunch of little stuff that is important but 
makes up the remaining amount. 

But to understand biology we're rea lly going to have to try and figure out how cells 
work. We're going to need to ta lk about the properties of those molecules. And just 
so you'll know, this p icture is actually,  this was made by somebody at Lawrence 
Berkeley National Labs. As far as I know she still hasn't published it. This is an image 
of an actua l cell. 

It's made by a very fancy technique called x-ray tomography where she sort of takes 
a zillion little sort of slices and then assemb les the whole thing. This is a yeast cell. 
That purp le thing, artificia lly colored, is the nucleus. This thing in the midd le  is a big 
storage thing called a vacuole in the cell. We cannot see the other cellular 
components right now, but that is a  real cell. It looks like a textbook, but it's actually 
a yeast cell that got  its p icture taken by this very fancy thing. 

So, as I say, we're going to charge right now into starting to think about these 
various molecular forces that make possible, that give these various b iomolecules or 
biomacromolecules their properties. And I just want to give you sort of a game p lan 
for how we're going to do this over the next couple of lessons, couple of classes. 
They're sort of classes of chemica l forces. 

And today we'll be talking about covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds. And we'll go 
onto to talk about other ones in the next class or two. And then we're going to talk 
about these b iological macromolecules that I just listed. Proteins. Actua lly, the order 
we'll be ta lking about them, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, proteins and lip ids. So the 

way I'm going to do this is I can tell you about the properties of carbohydrates by 
just talking about covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds. 

And once we've d iscussed those we'll go on here and I'll give you a coup le of 
examples. And once we've learned some more we'll go on and I'll give you some 
other examp les. And, as I said,  in a second I'm going to say covalent bonds. It's 
going to seem boring. Here's just something to sort of keep in, we'll get another one 
in a minute, to look ahead, why do we want to do this sort of stuff? I showed you 
this picture the other day. 

These are E. coli swimming along. Those things I told you are those sort of long 
spiral things are bundles of protein filaments ca lled flagella. They're being rotated by 
a motor at the end of the bacterium that's rotating ten to a hundred thousand RPM. 
And that thing is moving at such a rate, so many body lengths a second that if it was 
me moving at that speed I'd be going 300 miles per hour that many body lengths. 

So these are bacteria swimming around. The motor that drives them is made of 
proteins. And this is a textbook representation of that motor. It has familiar parts to 
some of you. Here's a rotator. There's a bushing. There's a drive shaft and so on. It's 
got parts that you would recognize as an engineer, but it's a ll made out of proteins. 
And that's a textbook diagram. What I want to show you in the next slide is they've 
taken a whole lot of electron micrographic images of those things, and the resolution 
isn't so good, but they averaged a whole bunch of them. 

And this is what it looks like. So you can sort of see this rea lly is a machine. It's built 
of proteins. And to understand how these machines work you have to understand 
some of these forces. So that's why I'm going to start in and we're going to beg in 
with covalent bonds so that we're all on the same page right from the beg inning. And 
another aspect, as you'll see, even though you may have heard about some of these 
bonds before, there's a new issue that's going to need to occupy your attention. 

And that is, what's the strength of the bond in the context of temperatures and 
cond itions that are relevant to life? If you can break a bond at 1000 degrees it 
doesn't matter because you cannot have life at that temperature. You've got to be 
thinking about a much more restricted  temperature sort of range. So covalent bonds, 
as most of you know, this is the principle force that holds atoms together. It involves 
a sharing of the electrons. 

And an examp le you can all do in your sleep, I'm sure. If we take four hydrogen 
atoms and a carbon atom we can come up w ith this molecule which has four 
covalent bonds. This is methane. That's the molecule that the cow we saw the other 
day burps 400 liters of. Those are the little bubb les you see coming up when you 
walk around the edge of a lake. And it's usually those pa irs of electrons, as you 
know, that are usually represented like this. 

The typical length is about 0.15 to 0.2 nanometers. And the important thing about 
these bonds is these are strong. It takes about 83 kiloca lories per mole to break a 
carbon-carbon bond. So at physiologically relevant temperatures they don't break. 
They can rotate, they can stretch and they can bend, but they're not going to break. 
And so  if you have a carbon-carbon bond in a biologica l organism it w ill be doing 
this. 

The carbons will be going this way. They'll be bending back and forth this way but 
they won't be breaking. And to just g ive you a sense of how far away they are from 
breaking, the energy of, say, one of these vibrationa l modes  is about 0.6 kilocalories 
per mole so that you have -- The average bond is so  far away from breaking, even 
though it's a d istribution, and some are more than others that our molecules stay 
together, which is good because we wouldn't want our DNA  flying apart because the 
covalent bonds were breaking under physiological cond itions. 

But that also leads us to the need for one of the things that we'll have to ta lk about, 
which is one of the great secrets of  life, is that the metabolism, all stages of  life 
involve the making and the breaking of bonds. And you cannot just add a p latinum 
cata lyst and put it at 500 degrees centigrade under a thousand atmospheres of 
pressure. All the chemistry that happens in  life has to take place in aqueous solution 
pretty close to pH 7 at about, you know, 25, 37 degree centigrade. 

There are a  few organisms that can do  it out, but most of it is somewhere around 
body temperature. Room temperate is where a ll that has to take p lace. So what you 
can see is that there had to be some,  in order for life to occur there had to be some 
invention that would let bonds be broken and be formed under physiolog ica lly 
relevant cond itions. And those are enzymes. I know most of you have heard of 
those. 

We'll ta lk about them in a maybe more sub level, beyond what some of you have 
heard anyway. But that -- Keep in mind now that's the driving force for why we need 
enzymes, because cova lent bonds are so strong. I also remind you that there are 
different types of covalent bonds. That's a single bond. This would be a doub le bond 
or a triple bond. And they get stronger as you share more electrons. 

It gets harder and harder to break them. These are double and trip le bonds called 
unsaturated bonds. When we ta lk about unsaturated  fats and things that's because 
they have double bonds in them. So olive oil has double bonds in it and beef fat, for 
example, doesn't. Other molecules that have double bonds that are important are 
oxygen and nitrogen gas, which has got a triple bond. 

And when Penny ta lks to you about the nitrogen cycle this is one of the rea lly 
important ones thinking about ecology because we all use nitrogen, but most 
organisms including ourselves and most things on earth cannot break that bond. Yet 
we all need nitrogen. It has be what they called  fixed, so it's joined to something like 
ammonia or nitrite or something like that. 

And that little fluorescently labeled bacteria I showed you invad ing a p lant, we'll see 
it again,  is able to  form a symbiosis of p lant. It's one of the few creatures on earth 
that knows how to break that bond. And that's why you can get p lants that can 
grow, like peas and beans and alfalfa and things that can grow w ithout nitrogen 
fertilizer. Because they have a little bacterium who knows how to break that bond 
and they figured out how to get together and collaborate in a symbiosis. 

So these bonds are very important. So there's another characteristic of these bonds 
which is going to be very important for thinking about biology. And it's known as 
chira lity. And it comes from the fact that our life on this planet is based on carbon, 
and carbon's ability to  form remarkab le kinds of bonds. And, as you see over there, 
carbon forms four bonds. But right now we have to start thinking in 3-dimensiona l 
space because carbon is a tetrahedron. 

Carbon, four single bonds. And they're in a tetrahedral arrangement. So  if I label 
them like this, this means  it's coming out of the board, I'm sorry. A, B, C. And that 
means  it's going back  into the board. So if I do a mirror image, if I looked at what 
this would look like, if I could  look at its reflection in a mirror, I would see it would 
look like this. So these are what are known as optical isomers. 

And depend ing on how you are at thinking in 3-dimensions this may be obvious to 
you or it may not be obvious to you, but you cannot superimpose those. And this is 
critica l because all through b iology there are carbons that have four different 
substituents that join to them. And every time that occurs, biology chooses one of 
those arrangements, not the other. 

And we have sort of a macro way of perhaps communicating this. So you've been at 
the party at the dorm. I was housemaster in McCormick for six years a while back so 
I've lived at least in that environment. It's early February, you're having to go back 
across the Mass Ave bridge, it's minus 20 and the wind is whipping along and your 
hands are freez ing. And you reach into your pocket to get your g loves and uh-oh, 
two left g loves. 

Right there you have the prob lem. Biology, as a theme you'll hear over and over 
again, is about fitting shapes. And your hands are mirror images of each other. And 
you could think of your gloves as being sort of a receptor. And if the receptor is 
designed to take your right hand, take your left hand, I guess, let's say, you cannot 
get your right hand into the glove. It just doesn't fit. 

And it's at a molecular level. It's exactly that same thing. So we're going to have to 
worry as we go through this about not only how many bonds there are, but this is 
why the exact molecular shape, includ ing this optical isomer issue is going to be very 
important. There's another very important principle of cova lent bonds that has, 
again, a huge impact on b iology. And that concerns how the atoms involved in the 
forming that cova lent bond think about sharing electrons. 

In some cases the sharing is pretty much equal, as in a carbon-carbon bond. That 
would make sense since it's the same thing on both sides. Or a carbon-hydrogen 
bond. The sharing of electrons is pretty much the same, so the electrons on average 
are d istributed in between them. And this is what's known as a nonpolar bond. 
However, there are important cases of unequal sharing. And the characteristic of an 
atom or an element that determines how this sharing goes is known as 
electronegativity. 

And you could think of this as sort of a euphemism  for the greediness of an atom  for 
electrons. So if you have an oxygen-hydrogen bond, oxygen is more electronegative 
than hydrogen. What that means is that although the electrons are still shared, this 
is not an ion or anything, the electrons are shared, there's going to be a little bit of a 
negative charge on the oxygen and a little bit of a positive charge on the hydrogen. 

And that means you, you know, this w ill have all sorts of consequences, as you'll see 
in a minute. And there's one  important molecule, which if we did the molecular 
composition you can see there's a  lot of it around, and that's water. And it's got two 
OH bonds. And here's where the structure of water is important, that these two 
bonds are not 180 degrees opposite to each other. 

They're 104.5 degrees. So you end up with a little negative charge here, a little 
positive charge here, a little positive charge there. And so every single water 
molecules sort of have a negative side and more or less a positive kind of side. And 
this has consequences because this means that the water molecules are going to 
interact. And to understand that part I need to introduce you to this second force 
which we know as the hydrogen bond. 

And this is the -- This is a bond that takes place, that arises because of the slight 
positive charge of an H bonded to oxygen or nitrogen -- -- and the slight negative 
charge -- -- of the oxygen or the nitrogen itself. And  right in water we see this is an 
issue, because if we have water like this with a coup le little bit of positive charges 
here and there and a little negative charge here, and there's another water molecule 
over here, a little positive charge, a little negative, a little positive, we can get here 
what's known as a hydrogen bond. 

The hydrogen bond is about one-twentieth the strength -- -- of a covalent bond. And 
that number is really important, because what that means is that at temperatures 
that are relevant for life, not a ll the molecules w ill have enough energy to break, in a 
population w ill have enough energy to break that bond. But some of them will. So 
hydrogen bonds, let me just write that down, so at physiologically relevant 
temperatures some molecules -- -- have the energy to break a hydrogen bond. 

And we'll ta lk about it next time. But probab ly many of you know that DNA is made 
of two strands. And the whole principle of copying the genetic information is you can 
pull the strands apart and copy the comp limentary  information. And we'll spend a lot 
of time talking about that. But the relevant thing for the moment is those two 
strands, each of which are joined by covalent bonds, are held together by a whole 
series of hydrogen bonds between the d ifferent base pa irs. 

And so right there sort of is the root of why the cells are able to pull those apart, put 
them together. And so these hydrogen bonds are rea lly, really important. And 
because our life on this planet is based, we're water-based, and the reason water is 
such a good solvent is that it is able to  form these hydrogen bonds. So this is just a 
little movie show ing the hydrogen bonds, a little simulation of how they can move 
around and rotate. 

The green thing would be the hydrogen bonds here. This is not rea lly a  full 
representation because the water molecules are constantly changing partners so 
they form little cages and little shells, but they keep forming hydrogen bonds. They'll 
break one w ith one water molecule and immed iately reform with another. This  is a 
simulation that someone did. It's a p icosecond of what would happen to water 
molecules at zero degrees centigrade where they're  liquid. 

So, at this point, they haven't frozen but they're just above that. And you can sort of 
get the sense how they're changing partners here. Here's another simulation done at 
100 degrees centigrade. So this would be a boiling temperature. And what you can 
see now is every now and then one of the molecules gets enough energy to break 
free of these cages. 

And that, when you're watching something boil in a kettle, that, at a molecular level, 
is what's happening, is one or another molecule  is fina lly getting enough energy to 
break free of this sort of cha ins of hydrogen bonds that are formed. And it's when we 
go to think about how things interact in water, when you d issolve sugar in water or 

something in water, you try and d issolve butter in water, when you stick something 
into water you have to break a whole lot of bonds. 

So there's an energy cost to just simp ly putting something into water. And what 
makes things d issolve or not is whether once they're in there they can form bonds 
back again because water is carbon and hydrogen bonds. There is no polarity. To get 
it to dissolve you'd have to break hydrogen bonds. That costs energy. And it cannot 
form any because it's only got nonpolar bonds in the butter so the butter floats 
around on the water. 

But this is really a very, very important force. And, in fact, you know, this is why 
when some of the really interesting properties of water come from. You all know 
about surface tension. You've watched little bugs skate around on the surface of the 
water. This is the lizard that lives in the rainforest of Central and South America, and 
it's about two and a half feet long. 

And it can take advantage of this surface tension that's due to the hydrogen bonding 
of water to go scooting right across the water. This  is not the greatest of videos. It's 
what I've managed to  find so far, but you get the idea. It actually runs across the 
water. And you're watching  the hydrogen bonding in action here. When I was a grad 
student my work thesis was on the synthesis of ribonucleotides, little p ieces of RNA. 

And I went in a thesis competition. And at the end, where you're supposed to give a 
talk about your thesis, and there were four of us, I thought, well, at least I have a 
fighting chance. And when I got in there it turned out one of the other people who 
was competing was a guy who stud ied this lizard, so his talk was full of movies of 
these lizards running back and  forth across ponds of water. 

And I thought I'm dead meat. But it actua lly turned out I won it, so I was very 
surprised. But every time I see something like this  it reminds me of it. OK. And just 
to remind you, too, I mean you may not have been thinking of it in this way, but of 
course what was a ll that fuss about when they sent the expeditions to mars? They 
were looking for traces of water. And why is that so important? It's because water 
has this amazing capacity to  form hydrogen bonds and be the solvent that can let life 
go. 

The moon on triton has methane. All nonpolar bonds,  they're ta lking about ra ining 
methane and  rivers of liquid methane and stuff. You might think about whether it is 
possible to design a life form or not or at least what ways things would have to be 
different. OK. And we've done enough that I can quickly now introduce you to our 
first class of molecules which are carbohydrates. 

Julia, would you mind flipping that light back on  for a minute? OK. So carbohydrates 
have the genera l property, general formula. They're CH20. And you can have 
different numbers of them. N-1 carbons have a COH bond. That's known as a 
hydroxyl group. And one carbon has a double bond oxygen which is either known as 
an aldehyde if it's at the end of a cha in or as a ketone if  it's in the middle. 

And these things can come in d ifferent numbers. So if N equals three it's a triose. If 
N equals five it's a pentose. The sugars that you'll see in DNA and RNA are pentoses. 
They're five carbon units. A six carbon unit is a hexose. And a very common hexose 
that you're all familiar w ith, at least familiar w ith the name of is glucose. And the 

structure of glucose in a linear form,  if I draw it out here, it's got the double bond at 
one end, so it's an a ldehyde in that case. 

And then there's an OH this way, OH this way, OH, let's see. One, two, three, four, 
five, six. OH. And it's just going off the bottom of the end here, bottom of the board 
for some of you probably. But we have hydrogens in the other places. Now, what I 
had to do in order to put up this depiction was kind of flatten this molecule, which 
you'll know every one of these is a tetrahedral arrangement. 

And flatten it down so I could write it on the board. So there are actually four chiral 
centers in a g lucose molecule. And,  furthermore, although this is a representation 
that you can find in textbooks and I can write it on the board that's not how it 
appears in nature. What happens is that the oxygen here comes up and actua lly 
cyclizes to this carbon. 

And this hydrogen goes and sits up here. And it gives you, the way glucose is 
actually found in solution, this would be what's known as beta-glucose. And the 
reason I'm saying beta  is we've got a new chira l center that's formed by this 
cyclization. And just to g ive you a sense of where we are, this is one, two, three, 
four,  five, six going this way. And over here it's one, two, three, four, five and six 
that way. And you can sit there and work this out yourself afterwards. 

This is known as a pyranose ring because it's got, it's actua lly a six-member ring, but 
you can see one of the oxygens is now part of the ring and the extra carbon is 
sticking out here. And in solution, because of this new chiral center, we've now got 
the possib ility of this thing joining so that the OH is up or the OH is down. And when 
it's up, the OH is up, that's known as the beta  form. 

And if the OH is down, that's known as the a lpha form. So, aga in, we've got to keep 
our eyes on all these chiral centers. This kind of depiction, aga in, is sort of hard to 
draw. So, aga in, people tend to sort of flatten it out. And you'll see this kind of 
representation. You have to rea lize that this is approximately the 3-d imensiona l 
shape. 

This is a representation. Here's beta-glucose there. Every time that you change the 
position of one of these hydroxyls, we end up w ith another sugar. So this is beta-
galactose, sugar with very d ifferent properties. And the difference is here the 
hydroxyl is up, here the hydroxyl is down. Two different sugars, two d ifferent 
properties, but as simp le a difference as that. And then a thing that happens  in 
nature is you can join different sugar molecules together by a principle that you'll 
see over and over aga in. 

And that you'll split out a molecule of water and you get a new covalent bond where 
this oxygen joins over to the carbon over here. And what that gives you is galactose 
beta-1,4 glucose. This beta-1, 4 g lucose is a molecule that you know as lactose or 
milk sugar. And part of the reason we know about it is because in order to 
metabolize that you need to have a special enzyme that cuts right here. That 
enzyme is known as beta-ga lactosidase. 

That's an enzyme. It's a protein, which we'll be talking about in the coming lectures, 
and it's ab le to cause this bond to break. And what happens when you become 
lactose intolerant is you lose the beta-galactosidase that we all have as a baby, 

because we need to be able to eat milk. And if you don't have it then the lactose 
passes through your stomach w ithout getting metabolized. 

It gets  into your intestine and there are those ten to the fourth bacteria. They 
metabolize it, break that bond, and then that causes the gas and discomfort that's 
associated with lactose intolerance. So a ll the textbooks use  lactose as the, beta-
galactosidase as the common enzyme. So the first time I thought that I'd teach this 
course I thought, boy, I have a rea lly good idea. 

I'm going to come up with a sample enzyme that's different, but I have to learn what 
it was. And it was inspired by there's this product called Beano which is supposed to 
reduce the side effects that are commonly associated w ith eating beans, which 
probably many of you are familiar with from summer camps and things. And the 
technical term  is flatulence. But, in any case, this was supposed to be something 
that reduced  flatulence. 

So I thought it's got to be an enzyme. I know it had something to do with all of the 
saccharide s that w ill change the sugar. So I looked at the little thing of Beano, and 
it sa id Hotline, any questions ca ll. So I phoned up and sa id, hi,  this is kind of an 
unusua l question. I'm a college professor and I'm going to be teaching an 
introductory biology course. 

And I was wondering if I could  find out what enzyme you had in Beano and what it 
did to what was in the beans. And I said, you know, it's rea lly sort of an odd question 
but, you know, maybe I could ta lk to one of the scientists in the lab. And a woman 
says, hello, Beano. And she listens to me. And she says, yes, we have a special 
package we send out to college professors. And  the next thing I knew  I got this huge 
flood of stuff. 

So I am now ab le to quickly tell you why beans are the musica l fruit. And the basis 
of it  is if you join a g lucose and a fructose together by an alpha-1, 2 linkage you get 
sucrose. And you all know  that's tab le sugar. We can eat sucrose no prob lem. But 
what beans have is beans have a galactose alpha-1, 6 linkage to sucrose. Or they 
actually, sometimes they have two galactose alpha-1, 6 linkages to sucrose and we 
cannot metabolize them. 

And that's sort of related to the same idea as the lactose intolerance that they go 
through a stomach, and then the bacteria know how to break that bond and that 
causes the prob lems that you encountered at summer camp. And so what Beano 
turned out to be is it's a sort of low-tech biotech product. It's a  food-grade mold 
called neurospora. And it's a very, very crude preparation of an a lpha-1, 6 
galactosidase. 

In other words, an enzyme that can break that molecule. And once it breaks it you 
have sucrose, which we can eat, and galactose, which we know what to do with. And 
that's the basis of that. So the very last thing is to talk about polysaccharides. These 
come when you join together multiple sugars. And, as you can appreciate by now, 
there are many, many ways of joining sugars together. 

But suppose we take N g lucoses. There are two common ways they can get joined. 
They can get joined together by a lpha-1, 4 bonds. And these give a helical 
confirmation. And you know these as starch or g lycogen. These are energy storage 
molecules. And I've run marathons, some of you may have, but at least you 

probably know about carbo- loading. What you're trying to do before you go is you're 
eating pasta and everything, which is full of starches, so it's got polymerized sugars. 

And you're trying to get your body to take these in and polymerize them into 
glycogen so your liver is as  loaded w ith g lycogen before you start the race. And 
hitting the wa ll in a marathon is when you run out of glycogen. And then you start 
burning  fatty acids and it's no fun at all. But that's what carbo- loading is all about, is 
manipulating glucoses that are in an a lpha-1, 4 confirmation, if you just make a 
beta-1, 4 confirmation. 

So the only difference that's happening in the way we join glucoses together is 
whether the hydroxyl is up or down when you join the two of them together. You get 
something that's a linear molecule that forms hydrogen bonds between the sugars. 
So you have a linear cha in of sugars. And I'm not going to show the details of the 
hydrogen bond, but you have one cha in going this way and another cha in of sugars 
here. 

And you can get hydrogen bonds between them. And you know this as cellulose. So 
there are two very  important biomolecules that are made up of glucose. That's just 
some glucose there. And if you join them by a lpha-1, 4 linkages you get starch, corn 
starch, which you've all encountered. If you join them by hydroxyl  in the other 
direction you get cellulose. Cellulose is important in biology. 

It's what plants make their cell walls of. That's why you can have trees that are so 
enormously high. And I guess I'll close w ith one last. So most of the paper we get 
from cellulose is from trees. If you've ever tried  to make beer or wine or something, 
you probably know you've got to keep fruit flies away or you're going to get vinegar. 
And the reason you get vinegar is that the fruit flies carry on their feet a bacterium 
called acidobacteria. 

And it likes to live at the surface between the water and the air. And what it does 
then, in order to do that is it makes cellulose, and it floats itself right at the, it makes 
this great thick mat of cellulose. And it floats itself right at the a ir surface interface. 
And you can get a mat that's ha lf an  inch thick of absolutely perfect cellulose. And so 
you don't ever want to see that if you're trying to make beer or w ine or something. 

But it's a bacterium that's making this molecule. So you  find it in other p laces 
besides trees. So, OK, we'll see you on Monday.
