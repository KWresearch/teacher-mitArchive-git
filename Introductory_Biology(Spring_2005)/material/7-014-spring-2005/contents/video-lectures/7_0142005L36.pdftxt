7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 36 

And I just wanted to mention a few more things about community ecology before I 
move onto the final lecture which I've forecasted to you where I'm going to try to  tie 
everything together through a research story that I want to tell you about. But 
before we go to that, I just want to present one very famous ecolog ica l experiment 
from your textbook. Because what we're trying to do here in this lecture is bring 
together the first set of lectures where we talked about b iogeochemical cycles and 
productivity which we think of as the function of ecosystems with the last set of 
lectures where we ta lked about population biology, community structure where we 
actually ta lk about different species and how they interact. And the structure of the 
community effects productivity in b iogeochemistry. And these processes in turn feed 
back and affect the structure of the community. 

And this is something ecologists have known, but it's not easy to demonstrate this 
experimentally. So one of the famous experiments was done by David Tillman of the 
University of M innesota because these are very long-term experiments. And, of 
course, it's easier to do these kinds of experiments w ith plants because they actua lly 
stay put. So he asked the question is the species d iversity of p lants in a living 
community related to  the productivity of that community, and a lso  the resistance 
and the resilience of that community to stress? So what he did is he set up plots. 

And he went through generations of graduate students monitoring these over many 
years. This would be a p lot that would have a single species in the plot. And here's a 
plot that has 24 different species in the plot. 

If we mixed them together they were all indigenous species that would grow there. 
And he showed first that the total plant cover here as a percent was a  function of the 
number of species per plot. So estab lishing that indeed productivity, the amount of 
plant biomass produced was a function of species d iversity. And when you think 
about this it makes sense because the more d iverse species you have the more likely 
they're able to exp loit the full suite of resources  in the soil and are probab ly more 
resistant to predation. So the more d iverse the plot it has a greater biomass. The 
next thing he looked at, and this is in your textbook, was the effect of the b iomass to 
the resistance to disturbance. So this is a change in biomass one year before a 
drought and then to the peak of the drought showing that this ratio increased with 
the number of species. 

And finally the resilience, that is how long it takes for the community to recover after 
it's been stressed, he was also able to show increase as the number of species 
increased. So there is a  relationship between community structure, and indeed 
productivity, resistance and resilience increase if there is more d iversity, which is, of 
course, one of the motivators for preserving species d iversity on the p lanet globally. 
OK. Now we're going to try to tie a ll this together through this story. 

Now, going back, many of the slides that I'm going to show you you've already seen. 
Parts of this story you've already learned  from my previous lectures, so I'm trying to 
tie this together and remind what you know and help you to think about how you can 

apply what you know to current issues in g lobal ecology. So you remember this, our 
global carbon cycle showing the photosynthesis of the plants ba lanced by the 
resp iration of the p lants and the animals. You learned this. And superimposed on 
that is our burning of fossil fuels and land use changes, i.e., cutting down trees 
increasing CO2 in the atmosphere. And as we showed last time, I mean in the first 
set of lectures that this sudden excavation of this fossil photosynthate is causing a 
dramatic increase in CO2 in the atmosphere relative to historica l concentrations of 
CO2. 

This is thousands of years before present. And we're worried about that. This is a ll 
reminding you, getting you in the tra in of thought here. We're worried about that 
because there's good evidence that these increases in CO2 are already increasing the 
temperature of the p lanet. This is average temperature over the last thousand years. 
And if it isn't a lready there is certa inty that it will in the very near future. So let's 
look here in the ocean, my favorite ecosystem, where the phytop lankton, that you 
know all about now, play a critical role in drawing CO2 out of the atmosphere. 

And this draw down is referred to as the "biolog ical pump" of the oceans. And we 
talked about this very briefly. Here's the phytop lankton community 
photosynthesizing, drawing CO2 into the surface ocean. And then because of the 
food web, that you've learned all about, most of this phytoplankton productivity is 
eaten by zooplankton and by fish going through the marine food web. As  it's eaten 
they are resp iring and CO2 is released and it goes right out of the system. So CO2 
in, CO2 out. But some of that carbon, some of that photosynthetic product finds  its 
way to the deep ocean through feca l pellets of zooplankton, through aggregates of 
dead cells, through just basic mucus that fluffs off of jellyfish. It's all carbon that 
came from photosynthesis, but some of it settles down to the deep ocean where it's 
chewed upon. 

Now, here is where a ll those deep consumers that I showed you  in the DVDs last 
time are. There are fish and squid and jellyfish in the deep oceans that feed on this 
carbon that ra ins down, because there is no photosynthesis down there, and bacteria 
that then regenerates that organic carbon into CO2. So this functions as a pump. 
And the concentration of carbon dioxide in the deep ocean  is very high if you look at 
a depth profile of CO2. This is depth and this is CO2. 

And at the surface, of course, it's in equilibrium with the atmosphere. And it's very 
high in the deep ocean because at low temperatures and pressures it can hold. So 
this is a huge reservoir of CO2, so much that if you did a thought experiment and 
you killed a ll the  life in the oceans and just shut off this biolog ica l pump and then 
you let the oceans mix a ll the way to the bottom, which they won't do, but this is 
just a  thought experiment. And you let that all equilibrate w ith the atmosphere, all of 
that CO2, the concentration in the atmosphere would doub le to trip le what it  is 
today. 

That's how much CO2 is in the deep ocean. And so this is a natural function of the 
ocean ecosystem, is to mainta in this pump and maintain this gradient of CO2. So 
this you also learned, remember? That the oceans are not this homogeneous soup of 
phytoplankton, but there are areas of very high phytoplankton biomass and 
productivity and low b iomass and medium in the green here. And we talked about 
nutrient limitation of that primary production, which is the ava ilab ility of nutrients. 
And what I told you was that the sort of standard understand ing of this system was 

that nitrogen and phosphorus were the primary limiting nutrients,  this is a ll review 
for your final exam, in aquatic ecosystems. 

But I told you that I was going to tell you in the  last lecture that there was more to it 
than that. And there  is indeed much more to it than that. So for years we thought 
that nitrogen and phosphorus were the nutrients that were regulating this d ifferential 
productivity, but we knew that something was wrong w ith our understanding. 
Because these satellite images, which I just showed you, of the d istribution of 
productivity showed this d istribution. But if you took a simulation model and 
modeled the globa l productivity based on the availability of nitrogen and phosphorus 
to the phytop lankton this is what the model showed. They said this  is what the ocean 
should look like, not that. 

There should be much more productivity here in the equator and down here in the 
Southern Ocean than there actually is. And, in fact, people wrote papers why isn't 
the equator greener? And they had all these different hypothesis for why that might 
be, a lot of them having to do w ith grazing w ith the food web. Well, it turns out that 
iron is a  really important limiting factor in the ocean. And this is a story that has just 
unfolded in the last 15 years. And I'm not telling you in exactly the order that it 
unfolded, but more or less in the order that it unfolded. A fellow named John Martin 
who is an oceanographer out at Moss Landing Marine Labs had been studying iron for 
quite a long time in the ocean. And he had a hypothesis that iron was limiting. 

But most people wouldn't believe him because most people, when they went out to 
measure iron in the oceans, got very high concentrations. So they said how could 
that be limiting? Well, it turned out that most people were measuring contamination 
in their iron samples. And if any of you have ever been on a marine ship, if you look 
around the deck you notice there is always rust. They are constantly painting marine 
ships, right, because the seawater is very corrosive. 

And so there is rust everywhere. And it turns out that you have to be heroically clean 
in order to measure the concentration of  iron in seawater. And John Martin and his 
group  realized this and went out and developed  these techniques to collect the 
samp le and to have it never see air before it went into the sample bottle. And they 
acid washed the sample bottles through this process which takes weeks and weeks 
and weeks. 

I mean you had to rea lly believe that iron was limiting in order to go through all this 
agony to measure the level. So his group was able to measure rea lly low  levels of 
iron in seawater, but still they weren't able to convince people because this was such 
a totally different way of thinking about the oceans. So there was a lot of pushback. 
He also argued that iron is introduced to the oceans through atmospheric dust. 

Those people d id believe. And that if you  looked at the atmospheric dust flux, which 
is proportiona l to the iron flux, you'd see that in the Atlantic it is relatively high 
because you have wind patterns coming off these deserts in Africa. And a lso over 
here in the Western Pacific it's relatively high. It's low down here around the 
Antarctic because there's no land source there. So these patterns of dust delivery 
map on pretty well to this d iscrepancy to what we see and what we model if nitrogen 
was the limiting nutrient. So what John Martin argued was that there was  lots of 
nitrogen and phosphorus in these reg ions but there's not enough iron  for the 
phytoplanktons to actua lly utilize that. Remember the Red field ratio we talked about, 
how it's the availability of nutrients relative to what's required by the p lant that 

determines what's limiting? So he d id some experiments where he went out in the 
boat and took samples. 

In the control sample he would add nothing and another sample he would 
phosphorus and nitrogen and another samp le would add iron. And he was able to 
show  that the add ition of iron caused phytoplankton to bloom. He sa id iron is limiting 
in these regions of the ocean, but everybody sa id bah, bah, bah, no it's not, we don't 
believe you. They made up  reasons why these experiments couldn't be true. There 
are not zoop lankton in the bottle so this and that and the other thing. And so he 
persevered. And he said OK. If you don't believe my bottle experiment, I'm going to 
go out and I'm going to add iron to the ocean,  then you'll believe me. 

So he said we're going to go out with a boat. And what they did was, and my lab was 
involved in these experiments. We had a sma ll role, that's the boat, in measuring a 
certain component of the phytoplankton. But they pumped iron into the propeller 
wash of the boat and made a zigzag path in the ocean where there is about ten 
kilometers by ten kilometers. And the natura l mixing in the surface ocean in about a 
day would mix that iron through that patch. And, of course, meanwhile the patch is 
moving. The oceans are moving, the patch is moving, they've got these  location 
buoys, the capta in of the ship is going crazy trying to navigate relative to these 
buoys rather than relative to the solid earth. But we were ab le to actua lly follow the 
patch. 

And, oh, here's John Martin who was also a friend of mine. And sad ly enough he died 
of cancer before the first experiment showed unequivoca lly that iron is limiting. But 
he knew it was so that was good. Anyway, he threw out this line. "Give me a ha lf a 
tanker of iron and I'll give you the next Ice Age." This was before the experiment 
because he was trying to drum up enthusiasm for the experiment because he wanted 
to do the science. But you see the connection here. So what's the connection 
between a tanker of iron and an Ice Age? Exactly. 

If you fertilize w ith iron, the phytoplankton photosynthesized more. It could be 
argued that they draw more CO2 out of the a ir and will cool the planet. OK, so he 
got a lot of attention because of that, even though this was a scientific experiment. 
So now I'm going to, and we'll come back to that, of course, later. I'm going to take 
you on an oceanographic cruise so you know what it's like. And this is one that my 
post-doc went on. 

This was not the first iron fertilization experiment. There have been about five of 
them now, but this was one of the actua lly one of the more recent ones that was 
done in the Southern Ocean. They've been done in the subArctic Pacific, in the 
Equatorial Pacific. I went on the one in the Equatorial Pacific because I'm a cruising 
light-weight, but my post-doc went on the one in the Southern Ocean and  that's 
where these slides come from. But just to show you what goes into doing this. These 
are the vats where they mixed the iron which they mixed w ith an acid solution. 

And they a lso put in sulfur hexafluoride which is an inert tracer so they can use that 
to trace the patch. Here's the oceanographic ship. What you do when you launch a 
cruise is you patch things in these vans. And sometimes you have your whole lab in 
your van. And, in fact, for this trace meta l clean work they have specia l trace meta l 
clean vans where they're all Teflon lined and positive a ir pressure and all of that. So 
you ship this out to the Antarctic, and it gets loaded onto the ship, the van, and then 
gets tied down. 

This is what the lab looks like before the scientists arrive. It's just a bunch of tables 
that are tied. And these labs get broken down and rebuilt for each cruise because 
different types of scientists have d ifferent needs. And this is what  it looks like when 
everybody is settled in. It's a very crude makeshift thing very crowded with 
equipment and w ires and is all set up temporarily for a month's worth of work. So 
here's the shift leaving port. They're going out of New Zea land which is where most 
of these cruises leave from for the Antarctic. Here it is in the rough seas of the 
Southern Ocean. You cannot see this very well. But that's an iceberg which is a big 
problem down there, because that's just the tip of the iceberg. 

So navigation is very tricky. So here's a radar showing these icebergs scattered 
around that they have to look out for. Here's another one. Here's how the samples 
are taken. These little plastic PVC pipes are a ll electronically w ired. And this ball, 
when they're open, is drawn into it. So when these are lowered  in the water they fill 
up with water, and then you trigger it and the ball shuts it and then you bring it up. 
So you can set it, say this one goes off at 5 meters,  that one 20, that one 50, that 
one 100, whatever. Wherever you want them you set them, and then  it comes up 
and you have your water samp le. Working in the Antarctic is particularly difficult. 

In this case this person  is out there taking the snow off of these incubators that have 
samp le water in bottles trying to make the phytoplankton think that they are still in 
the ocean, but they are in controlled experiments here. And they're taking the ice off 
so that the light intensity stays the same. And this  is to summarize the results of the 
iron fertilization experiment just in a p icture. This is the water w ithout iron added 
and this is the water w ith iron added. 

The addition of iron to these waters causes major alga l b looms. And here  is just 
some of the data. We can just look at chlorophyll "a", which you know is a measure 
of phytop lankton b iomass in the patch versus outside of the patch. And this is 
actually a satellite image taken off of the NASA satellite of this iron-enriched patch. 
So there is no question now that the ava ilab ility of iron  limits primary productivity 
over vast reg ions of the ocean. 

I d idn't think I was going to use the board but I will use the board. And because the 
Redfield ratio, which you guys now know, of carbon, some nitrogen, some 
phosphorus. Remember? We ta lked about this, 106:16:1. If we add iron to this,  iron 
is about 0.005. Anyway, tiny amounts of iron are required  relative to nitrogen and 
phosphorus in order for a phytoplankton cell to grow. So you can leverage,  if there's 
abundance of nitrogen and phosphorus, it just takes a little bit of  iron to get this b ig 
bloom. 

And that was very appea ling to peop le. Any time it takes a little b it of something to 
get a lot of something, I think people get interested. And I think what motivated this 
whole interest in ocean fertilization, I think, is motivated subconsciously a lot by 
man's ab ility to manipulate a system so large w ith so little effort. But that's sort of a 
[subset?]. 

So the success of these scientific experiments, were really just to go out there and 
understand what regulated productivity in the oceans, were picked up very rapid ly by 
entrepreneurs. And the proposa l that was put forward was to develop a commercia l 
ocean fertilization industry where you'd fertilize the surface oceans with iron. And I'm 
kind of joking here that money comes out the bottom, but I'll show you how this 

works in a minute. And turn this into a business. And  there are a lot of unknown 
questions here. F irst the experiment showed that you could increase the 
phytoplankton growth here, but they d idn't show that you could increase this export 
because the timescale of this is much longer than you can stay out on a ship to 
follow it. So it could be that this is increased and then this arrow is increased and 
you have no net flux. 

There  is a little data on this flux now, but it's not compelling yet. Then the next 
question is if this was an industry, could you actually verify how much carbon was 
exported, if it could be exported? And then the collatera l effects, which we're going 
to talk about in a minute, could it be made profitable? And the biggest question is 
what would the unintended consequences be of such an intentional fertilization? And 
this is where you guys come  in because you have learned in this class a lot of things 
that could help you assess what the unintended consequences are, and we're going 
to talk about that. But how could you make money doing this? And it depends on a 
lot of things. 

Right now you couldn't, but there are peop le depend ing on a future in which you 
could, and this  is the way it works. There is an emerg ing market in carbon trading 
cred its, especially for countries that did sign the Kyoto Accord where there's a 
commitment to reducing CO2 emissions. And so these carbon offset credits are worth 
money. So the way this would work is, if it works, was you'd have this  industry, 
you'd  fertilize w ith iron, you'd be able to claim that you buried X amount of carbon in 
the deep ocean. And with that claim that would give you these carbon offset cred its 
that are worth money. Utilities companies could then buy those, and if there was a 
cap on how much carbon emissions they could have this would increase their cap. So 
it's just like, you've probably heard about tree plantations generating carbon offset 
cred its. 

And that's a going industry now. So that's how it would work. And there are 
companies, these are some websites. P lanktos.com, they have patents filed on this 
process. How they're able to do that is beyond me since it's pub lished in the open 
literature,  in the scientific literature, but they do. Their mission is to develop 
formulations to [manage?] phytoplankton productivity in carbon export. 

There's another one that you don't have in your slides. I just slipped this in this 
morning. But here's the website, Green Sea Venture, if you're interested. But it's 
another company that is marketing  this idea. And here's another. I just saw this ad 
last month in [EOS?] which is a pub lication of the American Geophysica l Union. And 
it seeks professionals to work on an ocean nourishment demonstration. This is a new 
word. The oceans need to be "nourished". So there's a psychology here. They'll ta lk 
about ocean deserts that are nutrient poor, need to be nourished. And this is not 
only for sequestering CO2, but the cla im is to increase wild  fish stocks by 
fertilization. 

And so some of these outfits are rea lly on the edge of cred ibility, and I will let you 
figure that out yourselves. If you did enough research you could find out. That's not 
part of your assignment for the class. But some of them are actua lly really rationa l-
thinking scientists and eng ineers behind them. So there's a whole spectrum of 
people interested  in this. So why am I concerned about it? In  fact, one of my good 
friends, who is a very good scientist, rea lly thinks we should exp lore the idea of 
fertilizing the Southern Oceans to bring the wha les back. Because he thinks that the 
whales are gone because the krill are gone, the krill are gone because the 

phytoplankton are gone and the phytoplankton are gone because the wha les aren't 
there to recycle the iron. 

And we don't know any of that, but that's the hypothesis. He thinks the ecosystem 
needs to be "jumpstarted" by an iron  fertilization. So just to g ive you an idea the 
way peop le are starting to think about ecosystems and our ability to manipulate 
them. So why am I worried about this? And why should you be worried? Because you 
know now from taking this class that it's not that simple, that ecosystems are 
complex. 

And you know that if you  fertilize w ith iron and you create a lot of organic carbon, 
phytoplankton, and some of that settles, a  lot of that settles down to the deep ocean 
where there is no productivity, if it's consumed and digested by bacteria oxygen  is 
going to be consumed, right? And respiration, heterotrophic bacteria, that's what you 
learned in the first set of lectures, oxygen will be consumed and CO2 will be 
regenerated. 

But if you have enough of this  it will actua lly, the oxygen in the deep ocean waters 
will decrease and can even go anoxic if you do it long enough. And when you change 
-- That's the function of the system, the oxygen concentration. You change the 
community structure of the system and you'll have a different assemblage of 
microbes there than you had before. And one of the things that could happen, for 
example, is that you would increase the ammonia concentration by this 
reminerialization, you could stimulate nitrification and denitrification, which you 
learned about in my second lecture, I think. And you remember that a byproduct of 
that is nitrous oxide. 

And nitrous oxide is also a greenhouse gas that  is 300 times more effective molecule 
per molecule than CO2. In terms of its greenhouse capability, in terms of its 
absorption of heat. So you're doing this whole thing to suck CO2 out of the 
atmosphere, but if a side effect is creating nitrous oxide, the amounts of which are 
impossible to predict at this point, you could be worse off than you started. And none 
of these proposa ls takes this downstream effect into account. 

The other thing that can happen in  low oxygen waters is the stimulation of 
methanogenic bacteria which produce methane that is 22 times more effective 
molecule per molecule CO2 as a greenhouse gas. So there are ecosystem 
consequences to this. You cannot just say I'm going to add this and make carbon 
and that's the end of it, because you make carbon and things happen to that carbon. 
The other thing that is overlooked that you guys know about, remember this 
diagram of global ocean circulation? If you fertilize the Southern Ocean with iron and 
utilize the nitrogen and phosphorus here, when those waters upwell over here a long 
the equation that nitrogen and phosphorus isn't  in them. Now, that nitrogen and 
phosphorus is fueling the productivity of these ecosystems upon which fisheries are 
based. 

Peop le are fishing the fish  from those systems. So those people should be able to say 
to these peop le, hey, you took my nitrogen and phosphorus. That has to be factored 
into your balance sheet. My loss of fish, my loss of income from the fish needs to be 
factored into your ba lance sheet for your carbon credit. And if you do that the 
profitability is really marg ina l. 

Finally, there are models from a group at Princeton that show if you do this in a 
susta ined way that after many, many years, this is 1500 which is the extreme, but 
even after 100 years you create, this is latitude. Here's the equator 40 degrees, 40 
degrees south. So this is a broad swath of the ocean and this  is depth, OK? So this 
shows a huge, huge anoxic zone in the oceans that would be causes by sustained 
fertilization in this way. Not surprising, you're making a lot of organic carbon. It's 
going to be consumed by bacteria. So that is all a story, a scenario to get you 
thinking about your future and your relationship with the earth's ecosystems in the 
future. Because our relationship with these systems is changing dramatica lly. 

We are now in charge. We've been  in charge for a while, but we haven't taken the 
responsibility of being in charge for a while of these systems. And your generation is 
going to be making these kinds of decisions. As we move forward and we experience 
the aftermath of some of the manipulations we've done in the past like burning fossil 
fuels and increasing CO2 in the atmosphere there will be choices to make. Do we 
just adapt to this g lobal warming or do we know enough about how the earth works 
to try to counteract it in ways like fertilizing the oceans. And then you'll have to 
decide are the risks of fertiliz ing the oceans much greater than the risks of adapting 
to climate change? And a new trend in thinking about the earth is thinking about 
nature and ecosystems as not simply as something that we va lue because they're 
part of our world and we should set up reserves so that we can enjoy them and see 
nature and so generations in the future w ill know what natura l ecosystems look like, 
but starting to think of ecosystems as things that provide services for humans and 
actually have a monetary value that is not part of our economy,  it's not part of our 
economic system but they provide functions to our world for free. 

And so as we destroy them we're losing those functions. 

And this is a very well known paper. There's a journal ca lled Ecological Economics 
that tries to ta lk about factoring in ecosystems into our economy. And this is a very 
well known paper on the va lue of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital. 
And course this is  impossib le to do but you've got to try. So they eva luated the 
ecosystem services as worth $33 trillion. And this is just a brief list of some of the 
services that they ana lyze in this. One that's pretty easy to wrap your bra in around 
is the pollination of crops by insects. 

We rely on insects to pollinate crops. They do it for free and we rely on that. And just 
this is estimated  to be worth $6 billion. That if you had to hire somebody to manua lly 
pollinate your crops if there were no bees and all of the things that are doing it, it 
would cost $6 b illion g lobally. There is decomposition of waste, recycling nutrients, 
dispersion of seeds, control of pests, purification of the a ir and water, ecosystems to 
do this. And this is compared to the GNP of $18 trillion per year, the globa l gross 
national product. So this is sort of a shift in our thinking about how we think about 
ecosystems. And just in the last -- This slide was in one of your handouts about, I 
don't know,  five lectures ago, but I didn't get to  it so I thought I would bring it in 
now. 

Just  in the last, well, April 14th was announced this Millennium Ecosystem 
Assessment Report, which was over a thousand scientists worldwide assessing the 
state of the earth's globa l ecosystems and from the point of view of strengthening 
capacity to manage ecosystem's sustainab ility for human well-being. So the focus is 
on how do we manage these things for ourselves and the future generation? And you 
can go to the website  if you want to get depressed. 

Well, you can get depressed about what we've done. But you can be optimistic that 
we're really facing up to this challenge in a very systematic way. But the bottom line 
is that two-thirds of the natura l machinery of the earth has a lready been degraded 
by humans. And water use  is dramatic. 

Major rivers are dry before they reach the oceans. We are mining groundwater 
basically. We're taking water out of the ground much faster than it's being 
recharged. One-quarter of a ll fish stocks are already over-harvested. I mean we're in 
a non-sustainable mode. I don't need to tell you. You read the newspaper and you 
know this, and so I'll skip over this. Oh, just this last part I think is the most 
important. 

The argument is that more and more peop le are going to be living in the cities in the 
future, so less and less in touch with nature. So nature is going to be more and more 
of an abstraction to us. And people are really worried about this because 
conservation of natural spaces is not just a luxury. This is a dangerous illusion that 
ignores our dependency on these systems. And we have to really strengthen that 
understanding. 

OK, so now I want to lead you, this slide several students have told me is the only 
thing they remember from this class and my other ecology class. And that makes me 
very happy. If this is the only thing you remember that's great because this is really 
the take-home message for you and your generation. And this is how we have 
changed our relationship to the earth and this is where we are right now. So you 
learned in the first  lecture about the biosphere, autotrophs producing organic carbon, 
heterotrophs consuming organic carbon and with a little b it of input from the earth's 
crust, nitrogen and phosphorus, and this system running pretty well before humans. 
And before the Industria l Revolution societies fit into this system of tight recycling 
taking a little bit off of the autotrophic productivity and putting a little bit of waste 
into  the system. 

But then we had the Industrial Revolution. We've cut down massive amounts of 
trees., we've changed the very landscape of the autotrophic system, and we've 
dramatically increased the waste stream. And we're mining the lithosphere in a huge 
way, elements, mining  for meta ls and things used in manufacturing, etc. 

, which is, of course, increasing this waste stream. So this is where we are now. And 
we know that this is not sustainable the way we're operating. So this is your 
generation's decision. Are you going to go this way or are you going to go  that way? 
Very simple. You've got to point your compass in the right direction. So this way just 
increases these streams, the waste stream and the erosion of the natura l 
ecosystems and the mining  from the lithosphere. 

This stream works toward  recycling within the societies that we've a lready built, 
restoring natura l ecosystems so they can do their functions properly for cleaning a ir 
and water, and leaving enough productivity for the rest of the heterotrophs on land. 
You know we're not the only heterotrophs. 

There are a ll these other species that rely on this primary productivity, the b irds and, 
well, all the species. So we need to leave some of that for them so the ecosystems 
can sustain themselves. And so this  is where we should be. And we just need to find 
the w ill to get there. So easily sa id, not easily done. And there's an organization 

called The Natura l Step. I put this website, which you might want to write down 
because I don't think this was on your slide,  if you're  interested you can write  it 
down, that I think has a very, very creative approach to working w ith industry to try 
to d irect things in the right d irection and where they ta lk about the compass. And 
they say there are basic system cond itions for sustainab ility that if we don't maintain 
we will be going in the wrong d irection. And it's just a  tota l no-brainer. 

It's very simple. Substances from the earth's crust must not systematically increase 
in nature. Obviously, that's not sustainable if you do that and substances produced 
by society must not systematically increase  in nature. We cannot keep pouring waste 
into nature. The physical basis for the productivity and diversity of nature, i.e., the 
green part, the autotrophic cycle cannot be systematically deteriorated. And then 
they add to this we must be efficient enough to meet basic human needs. 

We have to work toward efficiency which is working toward tightening this recycling 
here. And they've been very effective in many countries in pointing  industries in the 
right direction. Every time that they make a decision about what meta l to use in a 
particular manufacturing process, they look at how much of that metal has already 
been mined. Is there an a lternative metal that they could, etc. 

They're constantly using at this compass. OK. Obviously, the compass  is not pointed 
in the right d irection. A no-brainer. Building cars that use more fuel and get less 
miles per gallon is not the right d irection. So some of these are very easy to answer. 
And I don't want to cast dispersion on SUVs, but in case you didn't recognize it that's 
what that is. I mean  fuel efficiency is here, we can have it if we want to, and we 
need to work on that. And finally, well, this  isn't fina lly. This is second to fina lly. I 
love this cartoon. This is the [doctor Saturn?] or whatever looking at the earth and 
diagnosing our p lanet at this stage in its evolution. 

And finally I'll leave you with this image which is my favorite image of the earth 
because it has no nationa l boundaries and it really does remind us that it's a living 
planet and that time is now. I mean, I know this sounds overdramatic but  it's not. I 
mean we've changed this planet so much in the  last 200 years relative to a ll the 
years before. And the next 50 years, your time to make a d ifference is absolutely 
critica l, so I hope you guys will go off and save the planet for us. Have fun and have 
a great summer.
