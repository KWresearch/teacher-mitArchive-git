Transcript â€“ Lecture 7 

Just very quickly, I mentioned to you the other day that article about Romney 
making a policy statement about embryonic stem cell research and said here were 
sort of examp les of issues we were thinking about in this course that would come 
into your ordinary life. Here's on today's Globe there's, "Kennedy rips Romney over 
stem cell policy". This debate is continuing. It's on the front page of today's Boston 
Globe. We have two peop le neither of whom probably have the background  in 
biology, that you guys are going to have by the time you finish this course, having to 
grapple with these very serious scientific issues that have a ll kinds of imp lications. 

Here's another thing. This was in yesterday's newspaper. This was on, I think, the 
second page of the Boston G lobe. It's about a curator over at Harvard at The 
Museum of Comparative Zoology that got all these d ifferent birds, some of whom are 
extinct and something. And now the curator, instead of just having them  there as a 
sort of collection and that's all it is, is getting DNA out of these specimens and 
working back and looking at ga ining new insights from animals that aren't found on 
this planet anymore. 

And this was one was from, I d idn't want to show you this on Valentine's Day 
particularly, but this is critical. I don't subscribe to The New York Times but for some 
reason one appeared on my porch on Saturday morning. I opened up the first page, 
"Rare and aggressive HIV reported in New York". I'll be talking to you about the HIV-
1 virus which is the virus that ends up destroying some of your major defender cells 
in the immune system. 

And then people die of AIDS which is sort of a ll the other stuff that then happens. 
And it was terribly scary when  it first showed up. There was no treatment for it. It's 
like that in most of the Third World and people d ie if they get it. I lost a close friend 
to it after it first came up. Then they came up w ith these various cockta ils of 
different inhibitors. And the idea was instead of just having a single drug target 
where it would be easy for the virus to mutate and, as I'll tell you, the HIV virus 
mutates like crazy. 

Instead they'd use multip le targets and that's why they do it. And sort of then the 
chances of it getting a mutation, you multiply all these low probabilities of getting a 
mutation and would hope it would never happen. It's happened. There in New York is 
a version of HIV-1 that is resistant to everything. If that spreads, which it probab ly 
will, it will be just like what happened w ith all the bacteria and antib iotics. 

It works for a little while, natura l mutation and natural selection, something w ill 
happen, the organism or the virus will change so that it's no longer resistant. So, you 
know, for the moment, as always, you know, make sure you never expose yourself 
to AIDS. This would take us back just like to before any of these things were 
inhibited. And the same thing goes right now. 

There are stra ins of mycobacterium tuberculosis that are resistant to every known 
antib iotic. If you get tuberculosis with that thing it's like you were  living 200 years 

ago. They cannot do anything for you. They'd put you in a sanatorium but you 
cannot be cured. This is worse. You know, this is aw ful. This one kills you. So just be 
careful. This is just the tip, but what a lways happens when you have antib iotics or 
drug treatments eventually natura l selection mutation will probably produce a 
variant. 

And this looks like it is happening. I don't know, I hope not, but I'm afra id this won't 
be the end of this one. OK. So some of you, I've read some of the comments. I'm 
not terribly surprised that some of you think why is he telling me a ll this. God, there 
was a  lot of work for tremendously confusing, there were a ll these chemica l 
structures, I didn't really get it a ll. It seemed that somehow out of this the cell got to 
two molecules of ATP. 

Why are we wasting a ll the time? Why am I wasting all this time telling you about 
how to get two molecules of ATP? This is basica lly what we were doing. We were 
looking at g lucose, which is C6H12O6, going through this process which pathway is 
of ten enzymatic steps. And what ends up coming out at the other end is two 
pyruvates. 

And the net yield of that is two ATP p lus two molecules of this weird thing called 
NADH. Now, I think most of you, although a  few of you still don't seem to have 
gotten it, the reason you need to make ATP out of ADP and inorganic phosphate is it 
stores energy. It's, you know, like having electricity in your house or batteries in 
your flashlight or in your iPod or whatever it is. You've got to have energy in order to 
do stuff. 

And cells need it. And the major sort of energy currency they use is ATP. And they 
put most of it by squeezing together a phosphate up to an ATP making this bond 
that's stable, unless there's an enzyme that'll break  it open, but there's energy 
stored in it. And they'll drop downhill and you can use that energy to drive other 
reactions. So for life to happen it had to somehow figure out how to get energy in a 
form that it could use to do a ll the b iosynthesis that's necessary for life to go on. 

NADH, I showed you the molecule, you got a structure. The cell makes some number 
of molecules of that. It's around. And what happened, it comes in, it helped some of 
these processes go. It ends up,  it's sort of like a banking system for electrons. If it 
gets NADH it's got electrons stuck on it. There are only a limited number of 
molecules of NADH in a cell, so if you make a ll the NAD molecules into NADH then 
you have nowhere else to put electrons and everything comes to a grinding halt. 

Because I was talking about redox reactions. If you're taking electrons off 
somewhere they've got to go somewhere else. And the cell uses NADH as kind of 
almost a currency for passing electrons around in just the same way it uses ATP as a 
currency for carrying energy around  from one form or another. Now, the problem 
was and why this was so important is this apparently, as I said, we're basica lly 
looking at an evolutionary fossil of some sort because every organism on earth uses, 
or virtua lly every organism on earth uses g lycolysis. 

It's in our cytoplasm of our cells. It's in the cytoplasm of bacteria. It's in the 
cytoplasm of archaea. It apparently evolved so long ago that every form of life on 
earth, you know, depends on this, anything that can metabolize a sugar molecule 
pretty much. And so it looks complicated. It is. Maybe you could have designed, I'd 
like to tell you that it's two reactions and you make two ATPs and it's all simple. 

Life isn't often simp le. It's often very complicated. It wasn't done by a team of 
design engineers in Building 10 designing it. It was done by something that 
happened with random selection. And when something  fina lly worked apparently it 
got fixed in evolution even if it  looks clunky. I think the other way to look at it is to 
say isn't that, I feel a sort of sense of wonder at this point, and granted I've had a 
lot of years working in the field, that something that comp licated could work out and 
take this molecule of glucose and make it into two molecules of ATP that can then be 
used to allow the cell to do synthesis. 

As in I'll show you, there's a better way you could use this much more efficiently, 18 
times more efficiently if we do respiration, which we'll talk about today, but that 
needs oxygen. And when life started 3.8 billion years ago or so there was no oxygen 
so it wasn't an option. The initial organisms had to make due with what they found 
and this is what developed. 

So ATP can go off and be used  for lots of things. The prob lem, if there's no oxygen 
around, as I said there are a limited number of molecules of ATP. So to make that 
glycolysis go you're taking some electrons off and doing the oxidation steps, you're 
reducing NADH. And if you want that to go as a cycle you've got to somehow 
regenerate the NAD+ so you can go through another cycle and make more ATP. 

So there were two variants that I told you about. If you don't have oxygen around, 
one of these variants yields to lactate, and so the net yield of this is two ATP. 
Because what happens in this part is it uses up two molecules of NADH chang ing the 
two molecules of pyruvate to two molecules of  lactate, so that gets rid of this, and 
the net yield of the whole thing is two molecules of ATP. 

The other way to do it is the way yeast does it. It makes two molecules of CO2 p lus 
two molecules of ethanol. And I think when I wrote that on the board I showed you 
that there was aceta ldehyde. We had two molecules of that going to two molecules 
of ethanol. And I think I forgot to write on the board that it used up two molecules of 
NADH because that's important. So that's what this whole thing is about. 

It achieves the same thing. And the net yield of this one is two ATPs as well. So I'm 
going to ta lk about photosynthesis at the latter part of the lecture, but if you maybe 
reca ll the  initia l sort of thing I called "release one" came up here about 3.4 b illion 
years ago. Later on an improved version came a long that started to generate 
oxygen. Now, it took billions of years for us to get to our present level of oxygen, but 
when oxygen became available in the atmosphere then there was a new option  for 
making energy. 

And that was instead of taking this NADH and, remember, there are about 50 kcals 
per mole of energy in there, it's just being thrown away. It's not being used at all. 
But if there's oxygen around there's a new and better system, which you know as 
resp iration, it's a word you've heard. You know we breathe oxygen. We need to 
breathe oxygen because we're using the oxygen to make energy. 

And I'll tell you aga in. You don't have to know all the details. But there's a 
biochemica l cycle called a citric acid cycle. And it goes together with another process 
that's known as oxidative phosphorylation. And so this is if we have oxygen what we 
end up with at the end of the day instead of these products is six molecules of CO2 

plus six molecules of water. But more importantly 36 molecules of ATP. So 
resp iration is tremendously better at capturing energy from a glucose molecule. 

But this, I'll show you,  is a later arriving development in evolution. It had to be 
because it required oxygen in the atmosphere. And so even though we only get two 
molecules out of ATP. We all do it. And the other thing it generates is pyruvate. And, 
as you'll see, this process takes those pyruvates. That's the starting material for this 
part over here. 

OK? I hope this is making a bit more sense as to why you've got to keep your eye on 
the b ig p icture or a ll you're going to see is a whole lot of structures and chemical 
transformations that don't make any sense. This is a ll about making ATP and energy. 
And, as we'll see later on, photosynthesis. In cases it can be something to do w ith 
making reducing power for biosynthesis. So in order to understand this, though, I 
have to introduce you to another way of thinking about energy. 

Some of you still seem to be struggling with the idea that you can store energy in a 
chemical bond, but I think from the comments the majority of you have that. If 
you're having trouble, ask your TA or look in sections and stuff. But the insight to 
how this part came, even though this process, what underlies this was invented 
about roughly 3. 

4 b illion years ago, scientists d idn't begin to even get a glimmer of how this worked 
until about 1961 when there was a scientist named Peter Mitchell who got a Nobel 
Prize for the insight that he had. And what he recognized was there were sort of 
three forms of energy that are interconvertable. The energy of a chemical bond. And 
I keep telling you this, that ATP, if we hydrolyze that it goes to ATP plus inorganic 
phosphate. 

The delta G prime zero is about minus 7 kiloca lories per mole, but under 
physiolog ica l conditions it works out that each ATP gets you about 12 kilocalories per 
mole because life doesn't happen under these standard conditions. So that's one 
form of energy we've been talking a lot about. There's another form of energy, which 
you probably know intuitively, and that is if you have a high concentration of some 
compound on a side of a sort of impermeab le barrier and a low concentration on the 
other side, high concentration of sugar, low concentration of sugar. 

If you give the system a chance it will come to equilibrium. So the concentrated stuff 
will flow downhill until you're concentrated on both sides. There's energy that you 
could get out of that. So there's energy basically stored in a concentration gradient. 
There's another form which should probably be familiar certainly to some of you, and 
that's the idea you can store energy in an electrical gradient. 

If you have some kind of impermeable barrier and we have a lot of charges on one 
side and less charges on the other side then there's a polarity, there's an electrica l 
gradient, and that's a  form of stored energy. Now, it happens that a membrane is 
impermeable, as I've told you, to most things. So you can get a high concentration 
of something on one side and a low concentration on the other and controlled by a 
protein imbedded in it, whether those ever get a chance to come across. 

The same idea applies for an electrical grad ient. And  in particular of interest to 
biology are hydrogen ions. So if we have a situation  like this where we have more 
hydrogen ions on one side of a membrane than another then we have an electrical 

gradient, we have a polarity. And so  this is the membrane. And so all cells then have 
-- And the way it works is this is the outside of the cell and this is the inside of the 
cell, so more pluses on the outside, hydrogen ions on the outside than the inside. 

And it's about 70 millivolts. It may not sound that impressive, right? Another way to 
look at it, though, is the membrane is about three nanometers. So if you say, well, 
OK, what's the electrica l gradient across that? It's about 200,000 volts per 
centimeter. And high tension  lines are, you know, more like that per mile or 
something like that. So although it seems modest because the membranes, you've 
got have a very, very powerful electrical gradient in all cells. 

And so this is a  form of energy. And I think this was proposed in 1961. Textbooks 
often say it was adopted in the early 70s. I went to a post-doc at Berkley in 1975 
and people were still having arguments about whether this rea lly was the way. Was 
this rea lly something that was used in nature? It is. And  I think one of the most 
dramatic demonstrations that a proton grad ient can be a source of energy comes 
from this sort of thing. 

I'd showed you how this bacteria, these are E. coli swimming around with these 
rotary motors that spin 10,000 to 100,000 RPM driving those flagella. I showed you 
the p icture of the inner membrane of E. coli. And I mentioned it has a double 
membrane. This is sort of a protective layer. You'll see, a little b it later in the lecture, 
some double membranes again. 

And here's the motor with the b ig propeller, the flagella sticking out from it. And the 
way this thing, and I showed you, I guess, this picture and  then this textbook 
diagram. What drives this motor are protons flowing from the outside of the cell 
through here, through the proteins in here, through channels in them. And that's 
what provides the torque for the motor. That's what drives it. 

It's not ATP or anything. It's protons on the outside and inside. And there's a very 
dramatic demonstration that's sort of like Friday night horror films, where people 
found a way of popp ing an E. coli open so that a ll of the cytop lasm ran out and then 
it would resea l. So what you've got is sort of an E. coli that is just a shell, just the 
membranes and the proteins imbedded in it, and it just sits there at neutra l pH. 

If you now acid ify the med ium what's happened is you've created a proton gradient 
because there are now more protons on the outside. And this is just the same 
picture I showed you before. But what happens if you do  that experiment is the 
bacteria start swimming. They don't have any insides or anything but you have 
created artificially a proton grad ient and it drives the motor and they start 
swimming. 

It's sort of like "dead man walking" or something at a bacteria  level. I think it's a 
really dramatic demonstration of how you can use the energy of a proton grad ient to 
make energy. So the princip le that underlies how respiration works and 
photosynthesis works is that you take advantage of this comb ination of concentration 
and electrica l gradient. 

And it's known as the chemi -- -- osmotic hypothesis. Because here you have an 
electrica l gradient because of the charges. You a lso have a concentration gradient 
because you've got more hydrogen ions on this side. So you cannot rea lly separate 
them. They're kind of coupled. But the idea is that life uses this proton grad ient in 

order to make energy and do some of these energy transactions. So here's the sort 
of princip le of how it's done. 

You have a membrane like this, then we have a protein, and now we're not going to 
see all the alpha helices and beta sheets. It'll be one of those things we ta lked about 
that spans the membrane. The membrane, as you might guess from what you know 
about it, is  impermeable to hydrogen ions. So what this protein does that's imbedded 
in the membrane, it's a proton pump. 

And if you provide it w ith energy  in some form what it does is it takes a hydrogen ion 
that's on the inside and it makes it into a hydrogen ion on the outside. There's no 
chemical transformation of the proton. It's just gone from one side of the membrane 
to the other. It's almost like recharging a battery or something if you want to think 
about it perhaps in that kind of way. And then the second stage is once the proton 
gradient is estab lished and you have now many more H+s on the outside than on the 
inside then there is another protein that lets the proton flow. 

The proton flows down to grad ient and  therefore is ab le to come back inside the cell. 
Now, if that's all there was to it we wouldn't have achieved anything. We would have 
wasted energy, pump something out, pump something back. But this molecule has 
an interesting property, and that is the ability of the proton to  flow down the 
gradient obligatorily requires ADP plus inorganic phosphate. 

And as the proton comes down this energy grad ient there's enough energy given off 
by that, that the cell is ab le to capture  it and use that energy to synthesize a 
molecule of ATP. Got it? So you produce some energy like from the light in 
photosynthesis that we'll see in a minute, other ways of doing it, and then get it 
outside. Once you've got the gradient now you can make ATP. 

And, actua lly, one of the completely remarkable discoveries of structural biology, this 
is known as an ATP synthase. It's a protein. It's an enzyme. These are the kinds of 
things we've been ta lking about. This is a lso a protein. You see all the different 
things proteins do. So this ATP synthase, which uses this energy of the proton 
gradient to make ATP, its structure has been worked out and at a level, here's part 
of the crysta l structure. 

You can probably see some a lpha helices beta sheets. Here's a textbook diagram of 
it showing, it's upside down I'm show ing, but here's a proton on the  inside flowing 
across. And what's remarkab le is  it turns out that this ATP synthase is structurally 
related to the protein that's at the heart of that rotary motor that drives the flagella. 
And, in  fact, remember, I think I showed you where you could stick the flagella to a 
cover slip and the bacteria twirled around so you could actually see they were 
rotating? So people d id sort of the equiva lent thing, they managed to stick this ATP 
synthase. 

And you couldn't see that the top part was turning, but they used some tricky stuff 
we'll talk about with antibodies and there's something to attach a long filamentous 
molecule. It's the polymer of proton called actin. That's the same stuff we find in our 
muscles. And it made it long enough. You could see that when this thing was working 
that it was tw irling around. 

And so evolution took this same basic sort of p iece of protein machinery. And in one 
case it used it to capture the energy of a proton gradient and make ATP. And in 

another case it used it to drive this propeller, if you will. And here's sort of a simple 
diagram. So as the proton flows kind of what happens is the inner part of this thing 
sort of goes click, click. And every time it does it synthesizes an ATP. 

And it sort of takes that energy to push together the ADP and the inorganic 
phosphate overcoming that activation energy and getting them close enough that 
you're able to get that bond. It's a truly remarkable thing. This is a somewhat hard 
concept to grasp, I understand, but if you can understand this inter- convertib ility 
between energy in the form of a comb ined concentration of electrica l gradient and 
ATP, and nature goes back and back and forth,  it's absolutely fundamenta l to life. 

If we d idn't have this stuff going on we couldn't do it. You know, as I say w ith 
glycolysis, I wish it was simpler, but this is the way nature did it, this is the way we 
are, and from what I know about biology, this  is how it goes. And I wouldn't be doing 
it justice if I didn't tell you some of the deta ils. You're MIT students. You should be 
able to, I hope, some of how the world actually works at this kind of level. 

OK. Now, with that kind of background, I think we can kind of -- Pretty quickly I can 
help you begin to see what happens here. Now, remember the problem up there w ith 
glycolysis? It started when there was no oxygen, and therefore it generated these 
NADHs. They weren't any good. You had to just get rid of them so you took the 
pyruvate, organisms learned how  to put them to make lactate or ethanol and carbon 
dioxide, but if there's oxygen around then there's another possib ility. 

And that is you can comb ine these molecules w ith oxygen. So if we take two NADH 
plus two hydrogen ions plus a molecule of oxygen what we get is two waters. And I 
think I can show you what's going on there kind of simply. What NADH was, we got a 
pair of electrons here and a hydrogen ion. Well,  if we took that, what's that? I think 
you'd  recognize it as a molecule of hydrogen gas. So if you take NADH and oxygen, 
what the cell is rea lly essentially doing, it's taking hydrogen gas plus oxygen and it's 
giving two waters. 

So it's basically burning hydrogen. And  I think most of you know what would happen 
if I had a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen up here and chucked a match at it or 
something. We'd have a massive explosion. And, in fact, that's why there are 50 
kilocalories of energy released when that happens. And so on an energy sort of 
diagram, these free energy diagrams where we had the two NADH here plus the 
molecule of oxygen, and down here we have the two molecules of water, there is 
this. 

If that happened in one step it would be a huge amount of energy. No cell or 
organism on earth has figured out how to do that in one step. And I think some of 
the textbooks  liken it to sort of say it would be like setting a stick of dynamite off in 
the cell. And this is where one of these things that seemed probab ly like a kind of 
uninteresting thermodynamic property, to some extent, becomes to be really 
important in understanding b iology. 

And that is the fact that remember I sa id this drop in energy from reactants to 
products was a thermodynamic property? It didn't matter whether like you skied 
straight down the hill or you came down in a series of little things, you still got the 
same amount of energy release going from here down to there. So that's, in 
essence, what the cell does,  is it takes this energy and it breaks it into little 
packages that it's able to manage in a chemical way. 

And so  instead of coming down, and once it comes down in a series of steps, and 
every time it flows partway down hill it does something. And what it does is it passes 
two electrons to some kind of carrier. And then the two electrons flow downhill a 
little bit to another one and then to another one. And what happens when these 
electrons are flowing downhill, though, is that they drive that proton pump. 

So a proton pump takes the proton from being on the outside to the inside. And 
when the two electrons drop down to the next level another H+ goes from out to H+ 
in, again here. And if you understood what I said before, what the cell can now do is 
it can make three ATPs by using that ATP synthesis, and now taking advantage of 
those three pump proteins and making them into three ATPs. And then at the end of 
the day what happens then is these two electrons get together w ith two hydrogen 
ions p lus I'll show it as a half of an oxygen here to g ive you water. 

And what's happening up here  is,  in essence, the molecule of sugar, C6H1206 is 
being burned w ith six molecules of water plus this to g ive you six molecules of C02 
plus six molecules of ATP so that the cell is essentia lly achieving the same kind of 
thing by this process as if it had burned it in oxygen. There's that much potentia l 
energy released. And the total amount of this change in the G prime zero is 
something out of the order of I think it's minus 686 kilocalories per mole. 

It's able to capture respiration. It captures about 60% of that energy as ATP. This 
process of fermentation, this is what these processes that happen in the absence of 
oxygen are known as fermentation. As you can see,  they're much less efficient. It 
gets more like 3.3% of the energy captured as ATP. So you can see when oxygen 
arose in the environment what a huge boom it was to life because you could get a lot 
more energy for the same amount of starting materia l. 

There  is one thing, though, that the cell has to do. In order to do  this it has to do 
some more chemistry because  it has to take those pyruvates and it has to somehow 
run them through this thing that I've ca lled the citric acid cycle and oxidative 
phosphorylation. Well, the oxidative phosphorylation is basically this chain I've 
diagramed for you here in a schematic way. 

And that's about the  level you'll have to understand it. I mean physically it's going to 
be a bunch of proteins stuck in the membrane, and as the electrons get passed a long 
they pump a proton as this pathway occurs. But the other thing the cells have to do 
is they have to take those two pyruvates and they have to burn them all the way 
down to C02 and water. And what's happening, if you remember that cha in of 
oxidations, the carbons are being successfully oxidized all the way up to carbon 
dioxide. 

You cannot be anymore oxidized than that if you're carbon. What that must mean is 
something else is getting reduced. And what gets reduced, where the electrons go is 
NADHs. So once oxygen became ava ilab le  in the atmosphere then the name of the 
game was to take those two pyruvates and to somehow burn them all the way down 
to here, and therefore generate as much NADH as possib le. And if you can make 
some ATPs along the way well and good. 

So there had to be a whole other set of chemica l reactions that's every b it as 
complicated as g lycolysis that emerged in nature, that carried out that job. And this 
time I'm not going to take you through a ll of the chemica l structures. You can look at 

it in your textbook and stuff, but what I rea lly want you to kind of take is to keep 
your eye on the number of carbons. 

If you look at the structure of pyruvate you'll see that it's three carbons, and it was 
this. Here's the keto group and an acid ic group. So this is almost carbon dioxide. It's 
just one oxidative step away. So what happens in this cycle is that first the carbon 
dioxide is removed and this makes an acetate. In essence it's actua lly joined to 
something right here. And then this feeds into this thing called the citric acid cycle. 

And what it is, as I said, is it's a set of chemica l reactions that are designed to take 
this pyruvate and burn it a ll the way to carbon d ioxide and water, and to generate as 
many NADHs and ATPs as it can along the way. And, again, I w ish it were simpler. It 
would be really nice if it just did it straight from acetate, but instead you'll see, if you 
look at the TCA cycle, the C4 compound. And this gets joined together to give us a 
C6 compound. 

And then it oxidizes one of these carbons to give a carbon dioxide. Now you're down 
to the C5. It does it aga in, another molecule of C02, you're at C4. And then  it takes 
this C4 carbon skeleton, puts it through some transformations that enab les this cycle 
to go a ll over again. So basically the C4 thing just goes through the cycle. It's a 
carrier that takes this C2 right here, lets it be processed to give two molecules of 
C02. 

In that process it generates more NADH, a b it of ATP, and a kind of reduced carrier 
that you can think of for the moment largely equiva lently to NADH. OK. Now, the 
entity in our cells that carries out this process of respiration -- Of resp iration. So the 
citric acid cycle and the mitochondria is not actually in our cytoplasm, which is 
perhaps surprising, but all the enzymes for g lycolysis are. So remember my simple 
diagram of the eukaryotic cell one the first day? We had the nucleus which is a 
membrane compartment that has the DNA  inside it, and we'll have more to say 
about that in the next  lecture of so, but then there were some organelles. 

And one of them I said was the mitochondrion. And I also sa id in the first lecture 
that there's pretty good evidence now that the mitochondrion arose by some earlier 
progenitor or ancestor of a eukaryotic cell capturing some kind of bacterium. It's 
actually one that's sort of kind of related to E. coli. It had doub le membranes. And 
the mitochondria actually still have some of their own DNA, but this is where all the 
energy, a ll the enzymes for the citric acid cycle -- -- and oxidative phosphorylation 
are found in the inside of the mitochondrion, instead of something that probably 
used to be a  free-living bacterium. 

In contrast, the enzymes for glycolysis are in what's called the cytop lasm of the cell, 
which is sort of the main part of the insides of the cell. So you see even here this 
sort of evolutionary history that I kind of put out across the board. The enzymes for 
glycolysis arose so early in evolution they're in the cytoplasm of virtua lly every 
organism on earth. Eukaryotic cells manage to  figure out how to get 18 times more 
energy for a molecule of sugar, but in order to do it they kind of had to cheat. 

They took a bacterium that figured out how to do it, put it inside our own cells, and 
then it's able to run now, it's become a part of our cell and it's where all the process 
takes p lace. And if you  look at a structure of a mitochondrion it's actually got two 
membranes. You just saw a picture of that, an E. coli. And it's sort of involuted a 
little bit like this. And so this is an outer membrane of a mitochondrion. 

So I'm basica lly taking this and b low ing it up. So this is a mitochondrion. And the in 
and the out,  in this case there's an inner membrane. This is where the proton pump 
is located. This is where the ATP synthesis is  located. And when a mitochondrion is 
working what it's doing is it's pumping hydrogen ions from its inside, which is more 
or less the equivalent of its cytoplasm, it's whatever used to be the cytop lasm of the 
orig ina l bacterium, outside into the space between the  inner and outer membranes. 

And then it generates ATP by flowing back down. OK. So there are a couple of sort of 
things that affect your life that come out of this. One of them is understand ing the 
"freshman  five" or "freshman  fifteen" or whatever it is. You come to college and all of 
a sudden you put on a lot of weight. Sometimes you can figure it out because you 
ate a lot of Ben & Jerry's or a  lot of chocolate bars or something and d idn't do as 
much exercise. 

Another one of you said, gee, now I understand why I'm not putting on any weight. I 
do water polo, and I guess I must be burning up everything I eat as energy. And 
you're right, but now I can show you at a molecular level what's happening. So what 
happens, your body, everything is regulated, and it can tell if it needs, cells in your 
body can tell if it needs energy. 

If it needs energy and you eat sugar it runs right through here and it makes ATP. But 
if you've eaten enough and the things that monitor your body say that you've got 
enough ATP then it doesn't keep this process going. Instead what  it does is it stops it 
and says instead we're going to put something away for a ra iny day, which you could 
see makes a lot of sense in evolution. You know, if things are good you just kill the 
mammoth and you can all eat well for a while or something. 

It would make sense for your body to be ab le to pack stuff away. So what it does is 
it intercepts the process at this level, at this C2 level. The pyruvate gets to here, and 
instead of being run through this in ATP this acetate or acetyl moiety which  is a C2 
gets run through a cycle of successive two carbon additions. And what comes out of 
that are fatty acids. It a lso takes three phosphor -- -- glyceraldehyde. 

You might remember that. That's one of the products stuck in the middle of that 
glycolytic pathway. So this is a three carbon compound. It makes it into glycerol 
which is a three carbon compound. And if you look back when we talked about lipids 
a couple of lectures ago you'll realize what happens if you combine fatty acids w ith 
glycerol then you've got fats. And, in essence, I mean that's what happens. 

We put on weight if we eat more than we're burning. Our bodies say, OK, I've got as 
much ATP as we need. I'm going to take some of that ATP and use it  in this kind of 
way. Just a second here. I'm going to see -- So  there's another thing that happens, a 
physiolog ica l thing that we experience. Well, we seem to be stuck at the moment. I 
won't worry about it. 

I've run some marathons. I don't know. A few of you may have. If not almost all of 
you have heard about "hitting the wa ll". And it happens genera lly around 21, 22, 23 
miles. It depends on the cond ition you're doing. And physiologically I have 
experienced, this is amazing, I understand why they call  it hitting the wall. You're 
running a long and you think, boy, I'm tired but I'm doing OK. 

And in a space of a quarter of mile it's like you banged into a brick wall. And you can 
sort of keep yourself going but it's a profound physiolog ica l change. And what has 
happened at that point is you've run out of sugar to burn. Now, I've told you, you 
can take sugars and you can polymerize them  into g lycogen. That's one of those 
polymers with alpha 1,4 linkages. That's a sugar storage molecule. 

So if you start running, you carbo- load, you try and get as much sugar into g lycogen 
as you possib ly can. You start running the marathon. Your body starts taking that 
glycogen and breaking it down into sugars. It runs it through that process. What 
happens when you hit the wa ll as a human body is most human bodies are designed 
so that you run out of sugar. You just cannot carbo-load enough to do 26 miles. 

You can get through 20 or something there. And when you run out of that what 
happens then is your body can no longer burn sugar so it switched to burning fatty 
acids. And that's less efficient and you really feel it. If any of you have done long 
endurance things or triathlons or anything you've experienced that change. The fina l 
thing, just to close for the lecture for today, is one thing you can appreciate. 

Yeast is somebody that can do both of these things, right? It can either grow 
anaeorb ica lly. And it makes C02 plus ethanol. Or it can grow aerob ica lly. And this 
gives it two ATPs per glucose and this g ives it 36 ATPs per glucose. So if you were a 
yeast, you would have to somehow regulate the rate of glycolysis depend ing on 
whether there was oxygen around or not. And it's very tricky and neat way it 
happens. 

There's an enzyme, that wouldn't surprise you, that has an active site for one of the 
key steps in the pathway where it's going from fructose-1-phosphate,  fructose-6-
phosphate to  fructose-1,6-diphosphate. That's one of the intermediate steps in 
glycolysis. It's the enzyme that turns out to be rate- limiting. You can control passage 
of something through a pathway by just making one step rate- limiting. 

So this has a p lace for the fructose 6 phosphate plus ATP to b ind, and it catalyzes 
the formation of the fructose-1,6-d iphosphate. But that enzyme has to work at 
different rates depending on whether the cell is aerobic or anaerobic. So what it does 
is there's a second bind ing site over here. And if it b inds ATP, this speeds up, excuse 
me, slows down the rate that's cata lyzed over here. 

And that's what you'd expect. If it's got enough ATP it doesn't need to run glycolysis 
as fast. And it also binds AMP or ADP, and that speeds up the rate. So the yeast are 
able to monitor,  to sort of have a control on how fast sugar flows through this 
glycolytic pathway. And what they're really doing is they're monitoring do I have 
enough ATP or not? And so if they're running with resp iration, making lots of stuff, 
they don't need to do glycolysis as fast. 

If they're anaerobic they have to run it 18 times as fast to get the same amount of 
energy. OK? We'll begin the next lecture w ith photosynthesis and then we're going to 
get into a bunch of molecular biology. OK?
