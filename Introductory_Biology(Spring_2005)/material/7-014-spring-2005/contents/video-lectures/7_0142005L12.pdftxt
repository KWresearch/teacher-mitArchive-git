Transcript â€“ Lecture 12 

By the time that Watson and Crick figured out the structure of DNA, you know,  it 
was sort of obvious that since the two strands were complimentary you could see 
how it rep licated. And they a lso could see that somehow the information must be 
encoded in the sequence of letters down the strands of the DNA. But it wasn't 
obvious what the code was and how it was arranged, how it worked. And in principle 
it was anything you could do w ith four- letters. 

And so I pointed out the other day this was sort of a four- letter alphabet. And I think 
it's useful to think of it this way with A, G, C and T, and RNA as also being a four-
letter a lphabet. But proteins are actua lly a 20-letter a lphabet because there are 20 
different amino acids. And so somehow, since one of the key things that the DNA 
had to do, it somehow had to encode the information for making the proteins. 

And there was a lot of work on protein b iosynthesis at the time. And it looked pretty 
complicated. Peop le had found that RNA seemed to be important. Cells that were 
making lots of protein had lots of RNA in them. And another thing they noticed was 
that if you looked in eukaryotic cells the DNA stayed  in the nucleus. The proteins, 
most of them, were out in the cytoplasm. 

And the evidence was that they were made out in the cytop lasm. So somehow the 
information had to get out of the nucleus where the DNA was and  into the 
cytoplasm. And biochemists were breaking cells open and trying to make cellular 
extracts that would synthesize proteins. And I think it's fair to say at the time that it 
looked extremely comp licated. And so thinking about how DNA encoded information 
and got translated into proteins was a very complex issue. 

But then actua lly there was a very interesting development that had a strong 
influence on Watson and Crick and led to them, Crick in particular, getting a key 
insight into the nature of this cod ing problem. There's a physicist, George Gamow, 
who some of you know. He proposed the "Big Bang Theory". A very strong 
theoretical physicist. And he wrote a letter to Watson and Crick. He thought he'd 
figured out the basis of the genetic code. 

And his idea was you had these sequences of A, G, C and Ts. And so everywhere the 
two bases came together there was sort of like a little d ifferent shaped hole. So his 
idea was the amino acids would stick into these  little holes. And he had a theory 
show ing that you could encode the sequence of proteins by having  the side chains  in 
the amino acids stick into these little holes a long the DNA. 

Now, there turned out to be a number of problems with that. It d idn't take into 
account the involvement of RNA, which there sort of was quite of bit of evidence for. 
And more importantly it didn't take into account the structure of the side cha ins of 
the amino acids, which you guys have been exposed to. But it had a very profound 
influence on Watson and Crick. They read this letter. 

They immed iately rea lized the idea was wrong and went out and had a lunch at a 
pub, decided aga in how they actually thought there were 25 amino acids, but they 
realized some of them were just sort of special ones that were modified only in 
particular proteins and there were really 20 amino acids that were found universa lly 
in nature and amino acids. And what they, Crick in particular, rea lized was that 
maybe instead of having to think about protein synthesis through this very complex 
set of extracts and mixtures a b iochemist would work on, that he could think about it 
at a purely theoretica l level, which basically  is up at this kind of level. 

But if you have a molecule that has four letters and it's going to be encoding proteins 
how does it do it? Can I work out sort of the basis or a possib le theory for how that 
could happen without actually knowing all of the biochemical deta ils? So Crick made 
a couple of simplifying assumptions. One was that the DNA only determined -- -- the 
linear sequence of amino acids and protein. 

That a ll this information about the 3-dimensiona l stuff came from  the properties of 
the linear sequence once it was made. And I think you hopefully have enough 
understanding of hydrophob ic and other sorts of interactions that would cause a 
linear sequence amino acid to take a particular confirmation. And the other 
assumption he made was that it must be universal. And it would be hard to see how 
life could have started if there wasn't some kind of code that was universa l between 
organisms. 

And if you start from those kinds of considerations then what you can see is you 
cannot just have a one-to-one correspondence between a letter in the nucleic acid 
alphabet and a letter down here. If A stood for valine that would be fine, but you 
could only have code for four amino acids that way. So if you had one-letter words in 
DNA there are four possib ilities. 

And so  it could only make four. If you had two two-letter words then you'd have 16 
possibilities, still not enough  for a ll the amino acids. If you had a three-letter word --
-- then you could do 64, and in princip le that would be all you'd need. It doesn't rule 
out there couldn't be five or six or seven-letter words. Or if you think about this as 
they were thinking about it at the time, even if it were let's say a  three- letter word, 
is it a code where you have one word, then the next word, then the next word? Or 
could it be an overlapp ing word? And what about punctuation? And maybe another 
thing, you can see if it's AG, CT, etc. 

, there's a frame of reference prob lem, because  if I'm going to read them in groups 
of three, if I start here I'll get one word, but if I start one  letter over the next group 
of three won't be the same. So somehow there would have to be a starting point. 
And so these are the sort of considerations that they had to take into account. And, 
in fact, Watson, excuse me. Francis Crick and another scientist Sydney Brenner and 
some other scientists worked out a very elegant genetic experiment that 
demonstrated that it was a three- letter code. 

And I don't have the time to go into it in this course. If you take a genetics course 
it's a very beautiful experiment. The princip le of the thing, which I could show you 
rather easily, is if you're writing a thing where you're reading in three-letter words, 
something like this. The cat ran out and, I don't know, ate the rat or something like 
that. And these were a ll just continuously run together, not separated out, but I've 
put them out here. 

As you can see they're three- letter words. If you lost one letter then it would change 
to sort of gibberish. You'd get stuff that  looked like this. And if you put one in you'd 
have the same prob lem, but if you were to either take out three letters or put in 
three letters then, even though there'd be a little mess in here somewhere, say I 
took out two more of these, what we would now have from then is the rest of it 
would now make sense again. 

And they d id this sort of experiment genetically. They managed  to figure out there 
were two kinds of mutations they could get in a particular way. Some were putting in 
a letter. Some were taking out a letter. And they d idn't know at the time whether 
they were adding or deleting, but they could tell they were in the opposite directions. 
And then they found if they took three of one class, like three that would delete a 
letter and put them a ll together then things would more or less work. 

Or if they put three that stuck in an extra letter then everything would more or less 
work. So there was a genetic proof of the three- letter part of the code before it was 
figured out exactly how the code itself worked. And so going from this sort of 
theoretical  insight into the code to actua lly figuring out how proteins were made 
there was still quite a lot of stuff that had to happen. And one was the concept of 
messenger RNA. 

As I said, there'd been quite a lot of evidence that RNA was somehow involved in 
protein synthesis because cells that made a lot of protein made a lot of RNA. And it 
seemed to be in the right sort of place in the cell for the proteins to be made. So the 
idea merged that RNA was somehow a carrier of information from the DNA to the 
cytoplasm. So it could serve as a template for making proteins. So the idea that the 
cell copied the sequence of a portion -- -- of the DNA. 

And we'd probab ly think of this as a gene right now. Into RNA. And the RNA would 
go into the cytop lasm. That's the part outside the nucleus. And then it would serve 
as a template -- -- for protein synthesis. Because of this thought that if you had a 
cell like this with a nucleus and the DNA in here, that if a piece of RNA were to go 
out into the cytop lasm and have those properties it would be functioning more or 
less as a messenger. 

It would be carrying the genetic information from inside the nucleus out into the 
cytoplasm. And so the term began to be used of a messenger RNA. And so over here 
I'll put an mRNA to indicate that. Now, one thing you can a lso see is we've talked 
about the structure of DNA and RNA. And it's essentially the same with one. This is 
the nucleotide, which is the fundamental building block of DNA. 

And if you reca ll,  in DNA there's a hydroxyl, excuse me, a hydrogen there, but in 
RNA there  is this extra hydroxyl. This is 1 prime, 2 prime, 3 prime, 4 prime, excuse 
me. Let's just leave it like for the moment, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And so the DNA was 
deoxyribonucleic acid because  it's missing this. But other than that the backbones 
are similar and the letters are almost the same. 

The A, the G and the C are exactly the same bases in DNA and RNA. The only 
difference is with the T and the uracil. So  this is thymine which is found in DNA. And 
this is uracil -- -- which is found in -- -- RNA. So the base pairing is over on this part 
of the molecule. So whether or not you have a methyl group doesn't really change 
the base pa iring. And so this process of copying  information in DNA to information 

that's in RNA was seen as essentially the same kind of language, but it's just sort of 
like taking somebody's word processor file and writing out longhand. 

You'd be transcribing the information but it would be essentia lly the same kind of 
information in essentially the same form. So this is known as transcription. I'll take 
just one very brief thing. Some of you may wonder why did nature do it this way? 
Why didn't it just use uracil in DNA? So as a very brief aside, I think we understand 
pretty much why it does it. 

And that is cytid ine has this structure. So this is C which is found in DNA but it 
undergoes, all of your DNA is a chemica l and it's able to undergo spontaneous kinds 
of damage. In fact, in every one of our human cells every day, 10,000 times in any 
given cell a base fa lls off totally just leaving the deoxyribose sitting there. And the 
cells have to fix it up. And we have DNA repair systems that do that. 

But another very common kind of thing that happens is that this NH2 group 
deaminates. And if you do that, if a C happens to deaminate in DNA it g ives you a 
uracil. And if that ever happens, the cell is actua lly ab le to tell that something went 
wrong because uracil is not supposed to be in DNA and there are repair systems that 
constantly scan the DNA and take out any uracils that are in there. And the reason, if 
instead of using thymine it used uracil then the cell wouldn't know whether the uracil 
got there because it was supposed to be there as part of the sequence or whether it 
had arisen by deamination of a cytidine. 

It's a minor point but I think we do have an understanding as to why there's thymine 
in DNA and uracil in RNA. This isn't such a worry in RNA. OK. But anyway. So there's 
still a  rea lly big problem here, though, that Watson and Crick and others were 
grappling with. And it has to do, as I say, w ith this fact that the information up here 
is the first in DNA and RNA. 

It's written as a sequence of letters, if you w ill, chemical letters, but there are only 
four letters in the DNA alphabet and essentially the same four letters in the RNA 
alphabet. However, the protein language has got a totally different alphabet so it's 
somehow like sort of translating now  from English to Japanese or something like 
that. Some rea lly fundamental change had to happen because there was a  rea l 
conversion  from one kind of language to another. 

And so this process is known as translation, as going from information that's written 
using a  four- letter nucleic acid alphabet to information that's written using a 20-
letter amino acid a lphabet. And Crick on purely theoretical grounds figured, well,  if 
you're going from one language to another what do you need? You need a 
translator? And what's a  translator? A translator is someone who speaks both 
languages. 

So his idea was that if there was -- I'm going to  just separate out, let's say this is 
the messenger RNA. And I, just for clarity here, have spaced out the three- letter 
words so we can see them. These would be three like G-A-C or something like that in 
the RNA. That there would be some kind of translator. And his idea was that it would 
be something that had a particular amino acid at one end and it had the 
complimentary nucleotides at the other end. 

So it could, if you w ill, read the genetic code that was written in the RNA using the 
nucleic acid a lphabet, but it would also be speaking the amino acid language. Got the 

idea? So the idea was that this would be, they used the words adaptor or a 
translator. So that was on basically theoretica l grounds. If you had to go from a four-
letter language to a 20-letter language you needed some kind of translator or 
adapter. 

Now, at that same time that these considerations were going on, biochemists began 
to find a class of sma ll RNAs -- -- that had an amino acid -- -- attached. And so there 
were entities that had just the sort of properties that Crick had envisioned you'd 
need from theoretical considerations. These were g iven the name transfer RNAs or 
tRNAs as they're usually referred to now. 

And I've told you that RNA has, since it's got nucleic acid bases, if you have a single 
strand of either an RNA or a DNA and you don't have a complimentary doub le-
strand, then if there are complimentary sequences they can come together and pa ir 
just the same way that comp limentary sequences can come together in DNA. And in 
the case of tRNAs, once the sequence of these was determined, oops. 

There we go. They folded up into a clover leaf shape. And the amino acid is attached 
up at the 3 prime end of the cha in up here  in what's known as the acceptor part of 
the molecule. And so that corresponds to this part up here. And here is what's known 
as the anticodon. Each of these three-letter words -- -- in nucleic acid language is 
called codon. And so something that had a complimentary sequence to a codon was 
called an anticodon. 

So if G-G-G is the codon then C-C-C would be the anticodon. Now, this is just a 
schematic, as you can see. It shows where the hydrogen bonds are that form this 
stuff. When the crysta l structures were done, the first crysta l structure of tRNA was 
actually done by Alex Rich. He's in the Biology Department at MIT. And he was in 
this picture I showed you ta lking to Matt Meselson. 

And a lthough we cannot see this terrib ly well, maybe you could hit the lights here, 
the crystal structure showed that the molecule d idn't look like a clover leaf as in 
there. It had more this shape. And I'll show you this more clearly  in this picture. I 
showed you this little part of the thing when I was showing you how an RNA could 
form. For example, if you copy the gene encoding a tRNA and,  for examp le, the 
sequence here in green is complimentary to  the sequence here, or the sequence here 
in sort of blue or purple was complimentary to the sequence here. 

That what can happen then, if you allow a single strand RNA like this to fold up, 
thermodynamically it will then go to the lower energy state which involves being able 
to make these hydrogen bonds. And  I think you can sort of see the clover leaf. 
Here's one of the leaves. The other is down here and the others. It's a little bit 
distorted here. And the reason is, because I'm going to continue now to show you 
how this structure, once you get to the clover leaf, then  it folds up to make other 
kinds of interactions and it takes that shape with the tRNA going on at this end and 
the anticodon being down here. 

And what's happening now  is they've morphed on the van der Waa ls surfaces so you 
can see what this would look like, 3-dimensiona l shape. The amino acid would be 
attached at that end and there is the anticodon that we'd be able to recognize, the 
codon in the RNA. I mean the physical reality is pretty close to this simple little 
depiction here. OK. So once this basic paradigm had been stra ightened out that gave 

rise to this idea then, putting it all together,  that the information  in DNA, that a 
portion of it would be cop ied into RNA and that would go out into the cytoplasm. 

And then in the cytoplasm these translators, the tRNAs would be ab le to decode, 
read the nucleic acid information and use that to determine the linear order of amino 
acids in a protein. Crick, when he came up with this, gave this the term "the centra l 
dogma". And peop le still use this term to apply this  idea of information flow going 
from DNA to RNA in protein. And it's still used to this day. There's actua lly sort of a 
little tw ist to that, because at the time that Crick proposed the term he actua lly 
thought that the word dogma meant "an idea  for which there is not reasonab le 
evidence". 

But he was sort of amused years later to rea lize that a more reasonab le definition of 
dogma is it is something that a true believer cannot doubt. So he kind of accidentally 
made an assertion that he was right, but fortunately he was right. Now -- -- the next 
big job, though, in working this out was to crack the code. And it's fine to know that 
it's a 3-letter code and it's fine to know it goes into RNA and then the tRNAs 
translate it, but if you cannot crack the code then you have no idea what any of the 
information means. 

It was sort of like before the Rosetta Stone they could look at the hierog lyphics in 
the Egyptian tombs and they could see that it was a lot of information and there 
were symbols and so on, but they d idn't know what it meant until finally they got 
something that a llowed them to relate  it to a language they did know and they were 
able to work out the princip les. 

So somehow scientists had then to crack the code. And there were two scientists 
who p layed a rea lly b ig role. One was Marshall N irenberg who was at NIH and is, in 
fact, still at NIH. And the other was a scientist who's on the same floor as me at MIT, 
Gobin Khorana. And they used two different approaches, but between these two 
approaches the genetic code was cracked. And what Nirenberg d id was to take a 
protein synthesizing -- -- extract that he knew needed RNA in order to work. 

So that wasn't a surprise at this point because people were thinking the RNA would 
be the message. And at that point the ability to make synthesized nucleic acids was 
quite limited compared to what we do now. And so there were different ways of 
making them. Sometimes you could do it enzymaticly. But what N irenberg, for 
example, was able to make was poly-U. So this was an RNA that was just UUUUUUU. 

And then what he d id was he set up 20 reactions, and in every reaction he put some 
of this extract, he put poly-U and he put 19 of the amino acids that were unlabeled. 
And then only one amino acid that had rad iolabel in it. So he ran these 20 reactions 
and wa ited to see in any of these d id he get protein made that would have been 
coded by the poly-U. And what he ended up with was polyphenyla lanine. 

Which you may recall when we were talking about structures of amino acids, there's 
the basic backbone. And the polyphenylalanine is the one that has, if you w ill, a 
benzene ring hanging off the end. And so what that meant was that UUU must code 
for a Phe or phenyla lanine. And if it's UUU in the RNA that must mean that the DNA 
that encodes this must have that sequence AAA and TTT. And you can see that one 
of the two strands of the DNA, since T base pa irs the same as urid ine, but one of the 
strands in the DNA is going to have the same sequence as one of the strands in the 
RNA. 

Now, I'll just tell you one brief  little anecdote. I heard Marshall N irenberg at this 
meeting they had to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the discovery of DNA. And he 
posed something that I'd never thought about in my years of teaching this but might 
occur to you guys  if we put it on a prob lem set. You all know something that 
benzene is nothing but sort of these, this as I ca ll it, we even referred to it as a 
benzene ring, which is a very organic kind of solvent. 

So if we put a problem set, if you've made polyphenylalanine would you expect this 
to be soluble in water? Well, this is very, very hydrophob ic, very, very water-hating. 
And your answer would be correct. If you said no, I wouldn't expect 
polyphenylalanine to be soluble in water. In fact, if it were in a protein you'd expect 
it to probably be in the core where a ll the hydrophobic interactions, the water-hating 
parts would go. 

So Marsha ll N irenberg sa id in his ta lk, well, he had shown that he had  radioactive 
phenylalanine, and he still had to prove chemica lly that he had polyphenylalanine. 
But he wasn't much of a biochemist so he walked down to the lab just below NIH and 
walked in the door and saw the first person he saw and sa id how do you solubilize 
polyphenylalanine? Just to make sure I got this right. And the guy said, oh, you just 
take 33% hydrobromic acid and glacial acetic acid and it works. 

So he went back upstairs and dissolved it. It turned out it dissolved in that. And he 
went on and characterized it. And he said it d idn't occur to him or he didn't learn 
until about 15 or 20 years later that he just wa lked up to the only person in the 
world who knew how to solubilize polyphenyla lanine. By total coincidence this guy 
who had talked to had been working away trying to  figure out a way and had come 
up with this odd mix of hydro- bromic acid and glacial acetic acid. 

And he just sa id of a ll the places  in the world, he walked up to the one person who 
knew and got the answer. So  the other part of the story then involves Gob in Khorana 
who I mentioned when I was telling you initially about the Nobel Laureates at MIT. 
And Gobin is a brilliant organic chemist. He synthesized DNA. You know, it was a 
point where a whole issue of a journal came out and there was nothing but his labs 
work and synthesizing DNA. 

Well, he was good at nucleic acids. And one of the strategies that they could use 
chemically was they would make something like a dye nucleotide like CA. And then 
they were able to polymerize that to make a piece of RNA. So they could make an 
RNA that had the sequence CA, CA, CA, CA and so on. And what you can see from 
that is that there are two different codons in that. 

One is CAC and the other is ACA. And the reason he made it was he was synthesizing 
it by polymerizing nucleotides. So in these same kinds of experiments I was 
describ ing before, what they found this synthesized was alternating histidine and 
threonine. And you cannot tell from that experiment alone. One of those must be 
histid ine and one of them must be threonine, but you cannot tell from that 
experiment so more experiments were needed. 

And what was learned from that experiment in that case was that CAC corresponded 
to histidine and ACA corresponded to threonine. So these kind of experiments were 
then put together to give what's known as the genetic code which is the three- letter 
words encoded in DNA that encode the sequence amino acids and proteins. And it's 

usua lly displayed as a table and you read it in this way. That this thing over here is 
the first base in the codon, across the top is the second base in the codon, and down 
over here is the third base. 

So if we go to C as the first, say the one for histidine we were just showing you. C  is 
the first letter. A is the second letter, so  this is the box that we're going to be looking 
at. And if C  is the third letter we can see it encoded histidine or AC come back to A. 
Then the A is certainly threonine. But you can a lso see something else here. And that 
is because there were 64 possibilities with this three-letter word the code is what's 
known as degenerate. 

That  is there are more words in the genetic code than are needed to specify the 
number of amino acids that have to be coded. So I just want to make a coup le of 
points about this. So the genetic code -- It's degenerate. There are 61 codons that 
correspond to an amino acid. And that means that some, and I think threonine is a 
good examp le, there's more than one word in the genetic code that means 
threonine. There were three codons for which there was no correspond ing amino 
acid. 

And those mean stop. And that would make sense because if you're read ing down a 
nucleic acid p iece of RNA, at some point you'd have to end the protein. And so there 
are actually three that are used for that purpose. And a lthough there's some small 
variation on this in nature there's usually one amino acid that's used for starting a 
protein, and that's methionine. And it's AUG  right there. Now, some of this stuff 
probably sounds like it's been around  forever, and that's certa inly true of some of 
the stuff you hear in your chemistry, math and physics courses. 

I just want to drive this home. When I was an undergrad Watson's first book called 
Molecular Biology of the Gene had come out, so when I was your age, and I realize 
that I look ancient but, you know, at least I'm still here. When I was an undergrad I 
had Watson's book. This was the genetic code that was in the book, the genetic code 
as of May 1965. And you'll notice there are gaps in here. And a ll the things that are 
underlined were things for which there was a tentative assignment. 

So a lthough you may take this and think that it's been know ledge that's been around 
forever, it wasn't even comp lete in the textbook when I was an undergrad. OK. So 
one of the things then that's important to think about the nucleic acid stuff, this is 
the basis of how proteins are encoded in the DNA. But everything else has to be 
there, too. 

And the genetic code, that's what we've been talking about, is universal. But there 
are other languages -- -- written in the DNA that are not universa l. And one of them 
was that little example I gave you w ith an orig in of replication. E. coli only starts 
DNA replication at one very particular point in its chromosome, so it is a particular 
sequence of DNA. It's actua lly about 250 nucleotides long. 

So you could think of that as a  language. It's like starting a chromosome rep lication 
language. It's only got one word in it, and the word is 250 nucleotides long. Another 
place that's very important, and that is if you're going to make an RNA copy, if 
you're going to do transcription of a p iece of DNA -- And  I'll call this the cod ing 
sequence. This would be the sequence of three-letter words that we'd specify the 
amino acid of the protein. 

If you were going to make an RNA copy of that, you would have to somewhere have 
something here that's a sequence up here that means start transcription. And one at 
the end, some other sequence of letters in the nucleic acid that would mean stop 
transcription. This is given the technical term that's referred to as a promoter. The 
stop one  is referred to as a terminator. 

And these, we'll say more about this. Because the beauty of having this system of 
making an RNA copy  is it provides a beautiful point of regulation. Because the cell 
can determine whether or not it's going to make a particular protein by whether or 
not it chooses to make the protein or not. And so having this RNA intermed iate and 
being ab le to control transcription is a  really important part of the whole regulation 
that makes life possib le. 

The transcription is carried out by an enzyme that's known as RNA polymerase. And 
let me make one more point. These promoters and terminators are not universa l. So 
when we ta lk about recombinant DNA a little bit  in the course,  if I take a mouse gene 
and I put it in E. coli. Even though the genetic code is the same, we might have all 
the same sequence of amino acids specified, you won't get the RNA made because 
the sequences that say start transcription and stop transcription are d ifferent 
between a mouse and a bacterium even though the genetic code is the same. 

So you can kind of see from first principles. If you're doing recombinant DNA and 
you wanted to express the mouse protein in E. coli, you would have to fiddle around 
with the sequences up here and the sequences down there, the parts that are not 
universa l. You guys with me? OK. So what does an RNA polymerase do? It 
recognizes this sequence, and then it teases the strands apart to make a little bubble 
like this. 

So let's say ATAGCTA. So the other strand then would be TATCGTA. And then RNA 
polymerase, unlike a DNA polymerase, can begin a chain de novo. Remember an 
important thing about DNA polymerases was they had to have a primer terminus to 
get started. That was they had to use the Okazaki fragments. So this is DNA. This 
would be 5 prime, 3 prime, 3 prime and 5 prime. And what an RNA polymerase can 
do, it uses DATP, DGTP, DCTP and DUTP. 

It uses triphosphates, excuse me. Get rid of these. Excuse me. My mistake. No 
deoxies here. Of course this is RNA. It uses ATP, GTP, CTP and UTP as the 
substrates. So  it uses triphosphates just the same way DNA polymerases do. And 
then it's able to start a chain de novo. And it synthesizes the RNA in a 5 prime to 3 
prime d irection,  the same direction that a strand of DNA is made by DNA 
polymerase. 

So it would copy here. And so it would put in an A opposite a T. And then because 
it's RNA it w ill put in a U opposite an A, and then an AGCAU and so on. So this right 
here is the beg inning of the RNA that's being synthesized by the RNA polymerase. 
This strand is known as the transcribed strand. And by default then that one is the 
non-transcribed strand. And what you can see by doing this, it's making an RNA the 
same sequences up here, except that everywhere there's a T there's now a U  in the 
RNA. 

So the fina l thing then is how  this information gets all put together to make proteins. 
And protein synthesis is done by an machine known as the ribosome. It's made up of 
some special large RNAs -- -- called rRNAs, some proteins as well. These make up 

the ribosome. And then it needs a mRNA and  then it needs the various tRNAs, each 
of which carries an amino acid that's appropriate to its anticodon. 

And in a very briefly sort of way this is -- And you can see this in your textbook, 
what the ribosome does is it takes, let's consider this is the mRNA. I'm just going to 
take three codons here. And this mRNA treads into the ribosome. And  I'll sort of 
show  it's ab le to recognize the first codon and the second codon. Remember, of 
course, there's no spacing like this in the RNA. 

And then in the context of this large factory it's able to find the tRNA that has amino 
acid one and the anticodon that would correspond to this. The tRNA that has the 
next amino acid attached and its anticodon. So you can see what's happened. It's 
been able to order the first amino acid encoded by that codon and put it physically 
right next to the next amino acid that's coded here. 

And then it catalyzes -- -- the formation of a peptide bond. And what happens when 
that does is the way this amino acid is joined to the tRNA there's energy stored in 
that bond. And so thermodynamica lly that a llows this bond formation to go. And now 
you end up essentially w ith this. And what happens now is everything clicks over 
one. So you could think of it as this whole RNA shifts over one so  the one that used 
to be here is now sticking outside. 

Here's part of the ribosome. Here's the next codon. What we have here is the tRNA 
that's got amino acid  two joined to amino acid one. The next codon specifies the next 
amino acid which is three. And the process is then able to go on like that. Now, the 
structure of the ribosome, the crystal structure of the ribosome was just finished. 
And I guess we've got as many lights out as we can do right now. 

It's absolutely remarkable. It's mostly RNA. The gray stuff and the blue stuff are two 
huge RNAs that are a ll folded up in 3-d imensional space. And these things that are 
sort of stuck on the outside, these purple things here or the dark blue things here 
that sort of look like cherries stuck on the outside of a cake, those are proteins. So 
most of this is RNA, big balls of RNA with proteins kind of decorating the outside. 

The mRNA is a green thing that snakes through. There's the mRNA. See it snaking 
through? And maybe you can recognize in the middle this tRNA. There's an orange 
one and a yellow one. Those correspond to the two tRNAs I dep icted here. And I'm 
just going to see if I can stop  this. There's a viewpoint I'd like you to see when it 
comes around aga in here in just a second. 

I'll see if I can catch it there. R ight there. Here's one of the tRNAs in yellow. And its 
end is right there. And there's the other tRNA. And its end is right there. So this 
corresponds to the point at which there's going to be an amino acid formed. And 
something is going to cata lyze the formation of that bond. Well, the next picture sort 
of shows what happens if you pull that apart. 

And what you'll see is that here's the end of one end of the tRNA, there's the other 
end, and there's nothing near it except for RNA. So RNA is actually catalyzing the 
formation of the peptide bond. Another way to say that would be that the ribosome, 
which is the protein synthesizing  factory, is a  ribozyme. Remember I said most of 
the chemical reactions that need catalysts are carried out by proteins but there are a 
few that are carried out by RNA where RNA is the catalyst? And remarkab ly the 

formation of the bond, which is at the heart of proteins which are so important for a ll 
life,  is cata lyzed by RNA. 

If you look at what makes proteins, what do you see? You see huge ba lls of RNA, a 
mRNA thread ing through two  tRNAs, and the enzyme activity or the catalytic activity 
is encoded by the RNA as well. As I said, people think possibly there was an RNA 
world that preceded our present-day world with DNA, RNA and protein. And who 
knows? But this sort of look at a ribosome could at least make you see that that's a 
plausible exp lanation that RNA might have been running the show for a while before 
anything else got involved. 

Anyway, we'll see you on Friday then.
