<p></p>
<p>So my name is Penny Chisholm and I am a professor in the Department  of Civil and Environmental Engineering with a joint appointment in  biology and I'm a microbial ecologist. I'm an ecologist by training and I  work on microbes in the oceans, photosynthetic plants in the oceans.  They're called phytoplankton. That's the research that my lab does.  Whenever I'm using examples in here, a lot of times I'll be using  examples of microbes and of plants in the oceans.</p>
<p>I know most  people know a lot more about trees than they know about things that  photosynthesize in the oceans. And I'll convince you that you should be  as bonded to phytoplankton as you are to trees in terms of recognizing  your dependency on them. So that's just a little bit about my  background. Now, let me find out a little bit about you. Is there anyone  in here who has taken the ecology class 7.</p>
<p>30 or 1.018 that I  used to teach but haven't taught for the last two years? No. Well,  that's good because there's some redundancy. And are there any  Terrascope students or alums in here? OK. Just curious. So let me tell  you just briefly about my hopes for our interactions in this class, and I  stress the term interaction. I don't want to stand up here talking at  you.</p>
<p>I really hope that you will ask questions and interact with  me. It makes it much more interesting for us up here if people are  asking questions and challenging. I expect you to challenge what I say.  The field of ecology is very broad. It uses knowledge from physics, from  chemistry, from geology, all these diverse fields, and biology of  course. And so some of the things I'm going to talk about, I know there  are students here who know more about it than I do because I think you  all are majoring in very diverse majors at MIT.</p>
<p>So I expect that  if I'm saying something wrong that you challenge me because we're all in  this together. The goal is to learn, not necessarily to be right all  the time. OK. So what I'm going to do today is really to give you a  broad overview of the field of ecology. And the things that I'll talk  about are things that we're going to go into in depth in the next series  of whatever lectures I have, ten or eleven.</p>
<p>So most of this you  don't need to take any detailed notes on or whatever. This is just to  forecast what's to come. At the end I'll tell you what the important  points are. So what is ecology? It's a very broad field and it's  basically the study of the interaction between organisms and their  environment. Or the study of what regulates the distribution and  abundance of organisms.</p>
<p>And what we're going to do is talk about  the subdivisions of ecology and look at the characteristics of  ecological systems, define some general characteristics and then we'll  begin to talk about ways that life mediates the transformation of energy  and mass on Earth. So in this class I'm going to be talking about all  levels of organization of living systems from the biochemical level, the  gene level to the entire biosphere, no small challenge.</p>
<p>So the  discipline of ecology, I'm going to move this down a little bit, is only  about a hundred years old. It's a relatively new discipline but it's a  strict natural science. Ecology is not environmentalism. Ecology is not  recycling. Ecology is a branch of the biological sciences. And it uses  the Scientific Method which I know you're all familiar with.</p>
<p>But  let's just review how ecologists learn about how systems work. And it  starts with observation. Sometimes called descriptive. You go out and  you describe what you see in nature. So description. And from that you  form a hypothesis about the things that are structuring that system. And  then you actually do experiments. And this is something that a lot of  people don't realize. We can do experiments with ecological systems, be  they microsystems, or some of the things we'll talk about in this class  are experiments with whole ecosystems.</p>
<p>For example, they'll  clear-cut an entire forest watershed and compare then the behavior of  the elements cycling in that watershed with a control watershed where  you don't clear-cut the trees. So it's a basic experiment, just like you  would do in test tubes. And there are numerous other examples about  manipulating whole ecosystems, fertilizing whole lakes. Obviously, it's  more difficult because you have to get permission to do these kinds of  things and have hundreds of replicates of these experiments, but it is a  way of understanding the systems.</p>
<p>And then from the experimental  results you test the hypothesis and then you develop models of how the  system works. And then you revise your description based on the models.  And then you keep going through that cycle. Ecology. At many  universities you can get a PhD in ecology. They have whole departments  of ecology. We at MIT don't.</p>
<p>We have very few people even who are  ecologists, but it is a field and you can go onto get a PhD. OK. So what  are the subdisciplines of ecology? And it has to do with the  hierarchical organization of living systems. Let me go onto my first  slide here. And I have a pointer. Oh, well. I have to stand back. So  when we think of living systems you can start with the atom. And  together they come together and make up molecules, come together and  make up the cell.</p>
<p>And then the cells come together and make up  tissues and organs, and then eventually you have an organism. Although,  you can have unicellular organisms. Here's an organism. And then a group  of organisms belonging to the same species is called a population in  ecology. And there's a whole field called population ecology. We'll have  a few lectures on that where you study what regulates the growth and  the life cycles of a particular species of organism.</p>
<p>And then a  collection of populations is called a community. And there's a whole  field called community ecology. And then a collection of communities.  This is a coral reef. Can you guys see these slides in the back or is  there too much light? Is it OK? OK. Good. So this would be a coral reef  ecosystem. And then all of the ecosystems collectively on Earth  constitute the biosphere.</p>
<p>So ecologists study these systems at  different levels of organization depending on what questions they're  interested in. But of course this is a gross oversimplification of what  we know about living systems. For example, an organism. I mean is an  organism really an organism? Think of yourself, for example. Are you  only one species? You're a human, yes. But there are parts of you that  aren't human, right? What's in your gut? E.</p>
<p>coli. There are more  bacteria in your gut than there are human cells in your body. And  without those bacteria you'd be in trouble. Also your skin is an  ecosystem. It's teaming with mites and little creatures that if you  looked under the microscope you'd be appalled. All of your pores have  tiny little ecosystems in them. And most of these are doing their job.  You're their habitat. And they're helping you be a living being.</p>
<p>So  you yourself are an ecosystem. So it's really difficult to talk about  these in a very clean way. I mean you cannot really study an organism  all by itself because each organism is in itself an ecosystem or a  community. Maybe not an ecosystem but a community of organisms. But this  is the way we have come to divide up the living world at different  levels of organization.</p>
<p>And we will talk about all of these in  this class. So ecology really has two broad branches. And that's how my  series of lectures are divided up. One is called biogeochemistry. And in  this branch is the study of how organisms mediate the transformation of  energy and matter in the biosphere. And this is essentially talking  about the metabolism of ecosystems. In some ways we will talk about,  you've been learning all about the biochemistry of cells and how cells  work and how they process energy, etc.</p>
<p>The sum of all of that  biochemistry in cells results in these biogeochemical cycles, the  interactions between these organisms and their environment. When we talk  about the metabolism of the biosphere you almost can think of yourself  as being inside of a cell looking at the biochemistry of the whole cell  from the inside. It's all a matter of scaling. And we'll see that.  You've learned about photosynthesis and respiration, right? Have they?  Yes.</p>
<p>Well, you'll see that those processes that you've learned  about that are subcellular collectively also have a metabolism for the  biosphere. OK. The second, and this will be my second set of lectures,  is population and community ecology. And here we talk about organisms.  Not just the biochemistry, their collective biochemistry, but this is  the study of the processes that regulate the distribution and abundance  of organisms.</p>
<p>What determines the rates of population growth of a  particular population? What determines the distribution of different  species over the landscape in a particular habitat? This part of ecology  we often talk about as being the function of ecosystems, and this the  structure. And the really important thing to remember is that these two  are very much obviously dependent on one another. If you change the  structure of an ecosystem, if you cut down all the trees you will change  the function of the ecosystem, there will be no photosynthesis.</p>
<p>OK?  So this is a really important point that these two are related. And  we'll talk about that a lot in more detail when we go forward here. If  we can turn the lights off I'll show you one of my favorite, favorite,  favorite slides, if it works. Ah, yes. This is to give you a feeling for  the Earth as a living organism, in a sense. This is the biosphere. This  is obviously a NASA image showing the green is the plants on Earth and  this is the dessert.</p>
<p>The green in the ocean is the phytoplankton.  And so where there's lots of green there's more phytoplankton. Where  there's red there's even more. And now we're zooming into the Equatorial  Pacific. Here's a big bloom of phytoplankton. And this is about three  seasons in the life of the Earth. OK? But it shows you how dynamic the  surface film of the Earth is that we consider the biosphere. And all of  this life and all of its cycling and dynamics influences the composition  of our atmosphere and of our oceans, all of the nonliving components of  the Earth.</p>
<p>And really at the biosphere level what ecology is, is  understanding the interaction between the living processes and the  nonliving processes in the Earth and how they co-evolved to shape this  living planet. If you were somebody out on Mars and you saw that, if you  could see that from Mars, but you probably could if you were living on  Mars because you'd be a different species and you could do all kinds of  things, but you would really get a feeling for this planet is alive,  just seeing those dynamics.</p>
<p>And it is. And we don't know if we're  the only ones but it's certainly worth understanding how the whole thing  works. So that's the goal which is rather intimidating but very  exciting. OK. And very important concept in ecology is a thymine of  emergent properties. And the idea is that at each level of organization  that we talked about here, well, if I cannot go back, I cannot go back.</p>
<p>Oh,  there we go. At each level of organization of the system that we talk  about there has properties that only exist at that level or  organization. So if you want to understand population ecology or  community ecology you cannot study cellular ecology and just scale up.  Now, this runs up against a lot of MIT reductionist philosophy, right? I  mean what we're all about here is taking things apart down to their  component parts and understanding them and then building our knowledge  from there.</p>
<p>But this whole field of complexity theory that has  emerged with a force, say in the last ten years, is showing us that  that's too oversimplified and that systems, at different levels of  organizations, have their own properties. So if you want to understand  how the Earth works you've got to understand the Earth. You cannot just  understand how all the atoms are working. They're coming together to  make the organisms.</p>
<p>And this is fundamentally because of feedbacks  in the system. So let me give you an example. OK. The brain, and this  isn't ecology but it's an example you can relate to, has ten to the  twelfth cells with ten to the fourteenth connections. And the emergent  property is your behavior, right? Those cells are connected in a certain  way which results in the way that you think and feel, your emotions,  your behavior, etc.</p>
<p>And in brain research we now have learned that  the way these cells are connected is influenced by the learning  environment for young children. How the brain is stimulated influences  how these are connected. So there's a feedback between the environment  experienced by a child and how these connections are made. Similarly in  ecology systems and throughout evolution there's a feedback.</p>
<p>You  have a bunch of cells doing a certain kind of metabolism which changes  the atmosphere of the planet. And then that atmosphere selects for  certain types of cells that weren't there before. So there's a constant  feedback between the emergent property feeding back on the system level  below and changing it. And that's really the characteristics of a  complex system. And we'll talk about, in a minute, some major examples  of that. One that I always like to think about and throw out is that if  you knew everything, did any of you have an ant colony when you were a  kid? Ah, you're deprived.</p>
<p>Oh, yes. OK. You get the sand and the  two pieces of glass and you put some ants in and they make all these  tunnels and everything. So if you knew everything about ants and ant  behavior and sand and the mechanics of sand could you ever predict the  pattern of those tunnels that they're going to build? Actually, most of  the classes I talk to say yeah. If I knew all that I could predict it.  But think about it. OK. Because I don't think you could.</p>
<p>And this  whole field of complexity theory is really exploding now. In fact,  Northwestern University, I just noticed on the Web, has just formed an  entire school of complexity that has people from all different fields  under one roof, social sciences all the way to physics under one roof  studying this phenomenon. And ecology is complexity at its best. OK. So  one other thing, before we move on, is that I said ecology is not  environmentalism, but it's a fundamental science.</p>
<p>But the  knowledge that is gained from the study of ecological systems and the  principles of ecology, that knowledge is used in a field that is growing  now called applied ecology. And that's where you use ecological  knowledge to influence human activities on Earth. And, for example,  you'd use ecological knowledge to understand how much of the Earth's  forests can we cut down before the system won't sustain us, that you  won't have enough photosynthesis to maintain the oxygen levels in the  atmosphere or draw down enough CO2 so that we don't all boil up.</p>
<p>We'll  talk about that. If you want to protect a particular species, how large  of an area do you have to set aside as a reserve? In order to know that  you have to do fundamental studies of the ecology of that species.  Basically, how far can we, as humans, push these systems from their  "natural state" until they won't function for us anymore? Because we  rely on natural systems for food, fiber and clean water and the  composition of our air.</p>
<p>But another point here, I just said how  far from the natural state can we push them, another big important  point, as we talk about ecological systems, is there is no original  state of nature. There is no baseline. Nature is ever-changing. Nature  is evolving. And we'll talk about how much the Earth has evolved since  the formation of the Earth. So it's important to keep in mind that what  humans are doing now, as we try to have conservation programs and worry  about global warming and the extinction of species, is that we're trying  to keep the Earth the way we think we want it right now.</p>
<p>I mean  the way we think it was before the Industrial Revolution, before the  massive flux of energy into the system has allowed us to completely  change the biosphere. And that's a really important thing because the  Earth "has a mind" of its own. And we know that, it doesn't have a mind,  it has a behavior of its own. And we know that there were massive  climate changes in the past and there will be massive climate changes in  the future.</p>
<p>And asteroid might hit us. And who knows all of these  things? It's going to change. So our challenge is understanding the  degree to which we want to try to control that natural change and try to  not impose rapid change in the rates of things that are already going  on. So it's a very tricky problem, and you guys are the ones that are  going to inherit it big time. You're going to be in charge of this  biosphere and you're going to have to figure out how to manage it,  because, like it or not, we are influencing it to such a degree that we  have to manage it.</p>
<p>OK. So another important concept is that, and  I've already alluded to this, the organism environment interaction is  two-way. I mean we're all used to thinking about the "survival of the  fittest", right? That you have this environment out there and you have  organisms, and the organism that's more fit, has most adapted to that  environment will survive and reproduce and that's how evolution works.</p>
<p>Well,  it's more than that. The important thing is that not only do organisms  adapt to the environment but they actually change the environment. They  co-evolve with the environment. And so life in the non-living components  of the Earth are interacting very intimately and life has fundamentally  shaped the nature of the non-living part of our planet. So an example  of this that I draw from your textbook, just a very simple example, has  to do with the influence of microbes on the succession of plants in a  northern ecosystem.</p>
<p>Succession is -- If you start with blank soil  and you just let it sit, how will communities of organisms come in and  colonize? You'll start out with very small plants and then larger plants  and then bushes and then trees over time. So sometimes ecologists study  this by clear-cutting an area and then following it over time. That  takes years and years and years, much longer than the average  scientist's lifespan.</p>
<p>So another way to do this is substitute  space for time. And that's what they've done here. This is a glacier  that is receding in this direction. And so where it initially retreated  soil was exposed and succession started. And then it retreats more. So  this area is growing while this one is just getting exposed. So  eventually, along this gradient, you have the youngest community up here  and the oldest community down here.</p>
<p>And so they were able to look  at the effect of that succession of different species on the  composition of the soil. And there's an important successional stage  here. So here's the nitrogen content in the soil as a function of  simulated time here and showing that it increases steadily as succession  goes on up to a peak and then levels off.</p>
<p>And that increase is  largely due to the invasion of plants that can fix nitrogen. Alder trees  are a specific species of trees that have in their roots symbiotic  nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Have you talked about this at all,  nitrogen-fixation? This is what Professor Walker actually works on his  research in his laboratory. He's a world expert on the mechanism of  this. But these nitrogen-fixing microbes are the only forms of life  really that can take nitrogen gas from the atmosphere, N2, and using  this nitrogenase enzyme convert it to ammonia which is what they need to  make proteins, etc.</p>
<p>So there's this huge reservoir of nitrogen  gas in the atmosphere, and only through these microbes can we get that  into the soil so that other organisms can use it. So here's a process at  the molecular level where the biochemistry that you're learning in the  rest of this class scaled up actually completely influences the species  that inhabit this ecosystem by increasing the nitrogen in the soil.</p>
<p>And  just to show you how important these microbes are globally, this is the  global nitrogen cycle. And don't worry about the details because we're  going to talk about this in future lectures in big detail. So this is  just to make the simple point that here's this biological nitrogen  fixation on a global scale. We have to start talking about big units  here, OK? This is gigatons of nitrogen.</p>
<p>So I've converted it. A  gigaton of nitrogen is equal in weight to a billion Volkswagens. So you  have to think on an annual scale 140 billion Volkswagens worth of  nitrogen is dragged out of the atmosphere and put into living organisms  by the biochemical processes that you're learning about at the  subcellular level. So massive quantities of stuff is flying around here  that you cannot appreciate until you see it.</p>
<p>Now, if there was no  life on Earth, that nitrogen cycle wouldn't be a cycle. None of these  processes would work without the microbes. And we're going to talk about  them in much more detail later. OK. The other really important cycle on  Earth is the carbon cycle. And so I've put this up here to very simply  -- Now, you've talked about these reactions in the biochemical sense in  great detail.</p>
<p>This is what I call my impressionistic biochemistry,  all right? The net reaction of photosynthesis is to take CO2 gas from  the atmosphere using water, using solar energy and convert it to organic  carbon. Think of this as glucose. Multiply that by six and you've got  glucose organic carbon and oxygen is evolved. So this is what we call  the "mass from gas reaction" on a global scale. This is the foundation  of all life on Earth.</p>
<p>Without it there would be no life. Life was  created from these gigatons of CO2 in the atmosphere and the solar  energy. And then the reverse, of course, is all of the animals and  bacteria, all of the things that cannot photosynthesis use this organic  carbon and use oxygen and burn it in respiration, that you've learned  about, to make chemical energy [as heat?] and cycling the gas back. Now,  in order for this to run, I love that part.</p>
<p>That took me about  ten minutes to figure out. This is that all the other elements on Earth  need to cycle through. And it's microbes that do this cycling. And we're  going to talk about that in the next lecture. Because the system would  run down if the elements on Earth weren't cycled by microbes through  various redox states. So this is just a more detailed scaled down  version of what you've already learned in class, photosynthesis, the Z  scheme, making glucose from the Calvin Cycle.</p>
<p>And then that  glucose goes into the mitochondrion. And you have respiration and CO2  evolved. So this is the micro scale version of what I just showed you  and this is the macro scale version of what I just showed you. This is  the global carbon cycle. And you have a hundred gigatons of carbon  coming into the system through photosynthesis and going out through  respiration.</p>
<p>So that's the collective photosynthesis and  respiration metabolism of the Earth. What I'm trying to have you get a  feeling for here is that this whole phenomenon of scaling, that these  processes occur at multiple scales from the subcellular to the biosphere  level. And this is the flat Earth version of the globe. In the northern  hemisphere you can see winter.</p>
<p>There's winter, no green. There's  summer, everything green. Winter, no green. Summer, everything green.  And now wait until you see this. This is cool. Because that pulsing you  can actually see. This is the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere over a  period of three years or so showing that when respiration is greater  than photosynthesis in the northern hemisphere in the winter, CO2 in the  atmosphere goes up.</p>
<p>When photosynthesis is greater respiration,  CO2 goes down. So you can see the signature of the Earth breathing in  the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Also you can see that this is  increasing. And does anybody know why that is? Hello. Did somebody say  something? Global warming, yeah. Greenhouse effect, yeah. But what's  causing that? There you go, fossil fuel. Burning fossil fuel is causing  an increasing trend in the CO2 concentration which is causing the  greenhouse effect which is causing global warming.</p>
<p>And we'll talk  about that. This is an emergent property of the system, the CO2  concentration. Now, in the last slide I showed you these arrows were the  same width. But life on Earth was not always that way. Respiration  didn't always balance photosynthesis. And this gets to my point about  there's no original state of nature. In the early Earth, photosynthesis  way outpaced the consumption of organic matter.</p>
<p>So what would that  result in? If this arrow is much more rapid than this arrow? Oxygen in  the atmosphere increased, exactly. Now, if oxygen in the atmosphere  increases, what happens? What else happens in order for that to happen?  This increased, too, right? And, in fact, that is the deposition of  fossil fuel. This is billions of years. Now we're going back to the  formation of the Earth 4.</p>
<p>5 billion years ago, origin of life.  Then we have the beginning of oxygenic photosynthesis here. And it's the  phytoplankton in the oceans that started this. And so oxygen started to  accumulate in the oceans but not in the atmosphere at first. So you  have all this photosynthesis in the oceans which were a very reduced  environment. So the minute the oxygen was evolved in photosynthesis it  reacted with iron, all these reduced compounds, particularly iron, and  made iron oxides.</p>
<p>So it never made it to the atmosphere at first.  So you had the deposition of these banded iron formations in the ancient  marine environment. Then eventually all of that got oxidized and it  escaped into the atmosphere and you started to have a buildup of oxygen  in the atmosphere. And at the same time that was building up there was  burial of this organic carbon because it wasn't being respired by the  heterotrophic organisms.</p>
<p>And that's the fossil fuel that was built  up over all of these billions of years. Well, not billions. Yeah,  billions of years. That we have now burned over a period of a hundred  years releasing all that CO2 into the atmosphere. So we're burning  ancient photosynthate over a tiny little period in the Earth's history  and throwing it into the atmosphere. And the Earth is saying I don't  know how to handle this.</p>
<p>So there's a big question of what the  Earth's system is going to do with all of that CO2 that we're putting up  there. And this is all going to happen in like the next 50 years. And,  as I always say in this class, I'll be dead but you won't when it really  hits the fan unless we do something. So here are the banded iron  formations. We can see the legacy of that history of the Earth in  today's rock formations, banded iron formations of marine origin and  terrestrial origin here.</p>
<p>And we can see in the Earth's composition  of the Earth's atmosphere the signature of the evolution of life. The  composition of the Earth's atmosphere is highly improbable.  Thermodynamically improbable if you didn't have the influence of  converting this solar energy into living biomass. And so the CO2  concentration is much lower than these planets.</p>
<p>And the nitrogen  concentration higher and the temperature a nice balmy 16 degrees. OK. So  this is just to remind you that these processes operate at all scales.  Biosphere. This is a little ecosphere I'm going to bring next time  showing you a sealed ecosystem in which all of these properties go on.  And finally. So I've been talking about levels of organization from the  molecular level up to the biosphere level.</p>
<p>And there's an exciting  new thing happening in my field that is so exciting I have to tell you  about it. And I'll probably be telling you about it more and more as I  go along here. And that is a whole new field is emerging called  molecular ecology where we're viewing the biosphere as a network of  genes. It's not that you either study cellular molecular biology or  biochemistry or you study the biosphere but you try to think of the  biosphere as a network of genes.</p>
<p>And in oceanography we're  actually able to start to do this because the oceans are dominated by  microorganisms, although in this picture I don't have that properly  represented, but we're starting to think about a sea of organisms as  being simply a network of genes. Most of the genetic information in the  oceans is in microorganisms. And I like to think of the oceans as  dissolved information essentially.</p>
<p>When you look out and you see  that blue water, there is so much DNA in there and so many genes doing  so many different things it's just phenomenal. And there are a billion  microbes per liter in sea water. 99.9% have never been cultivated. We  know nothing about them. There is as much information in that liter as  in the entire human genome, and most of it is of unknown function in  this biosphere.</p>
<p>And so just within the last year, this is Craig  Venter who was one of the people who sequenced the human genome. And now  that that's over with, he needs a new challenge. So he's taking on the  ocean genome meaning sequencing all of the DNA in the oceans. And he's  taken his yacht, because he's rich now, which is his research vessel.  And they're going around the oceans collecting samples, filtering them  onto filters and collecting all the microbes.</p>
<p>And then you take it  and you grind it up, you extract the DNA and you sequence it. And you  just get a bunch of little pieces that you identify as genes. You don't  know what organisms they belong to, but you've got genes. And this is  his cruise trek which you notice doesn't have many northern climes here,  although they did do something up in Halifax.</p>
<p>And it kind of  resembles the Challenger Expedition back in the 1800s which was one of  the first major oceanographic expeditions. So they published a paper in  Science last year. Just off Bermuda they found 1.2 million new genes  that had never been in the database. They had to create a new database  in order to even put these genes in it and 1800 new species. And he is  estimating the genetic inventory of the planet, most of which are in  these microbes, to be 20 to 30 billion genes.</p>
<p>And then we're going  to have to figure out what they're all doing. OK. So just the take-home  message. I'm going to try to do this at the end of each lecture so that  you know what I think is important. So we've talked about life at  different scales. Ecology is the study of life at all these different  scales. Emergent properties is a really important concept to understand.</p>
<p>There's  nothing more important than understanding this organism environment is a  two-way street. There's really no such thing as a free living organism  either. They are all dependant on one another. Even if you have a  culture of say E. coli which you've supplied glucose to so it can grow,  where do you think that glucose came from? It's the photosynthetic  product of some plant somewhere.</p>
<p>So organisms are not really  free-living. They are all dependent on one another. Life has shaped the  Earth's features, its atmosphere. The biosphere that I've shown you and  the geosphere, which is what we refer to the nonliving part of the  Earth, have coevolved over evolutionary time. And the genetic inventory  of this is completely unknown. And, of course, microbes rule the planet,  don?t forget that. See you next time.</p>
