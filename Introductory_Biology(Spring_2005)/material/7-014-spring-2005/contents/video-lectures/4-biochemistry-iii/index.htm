<p></p>
<p>So the big issue that I was trying to take on yesterday, and this is  of really fundamental importance to biology, is that you saw from that  molecular composition of cells 80% water. Of the rest of it about 50% of  what's there by mass is protein. Proteins do most of the really  interesting stuff in the cell. They're the ones that are able to  catalyze specific chemical reactions with all this amazing chemistry  that's needed for life to take place at physiological conditions.</p> <p>They  are structural components of the cells. They are all kinds of amazing  machines. I showed you the little flagellar motor that turns it, but  that's just one of many, many nano machines that are necessary for life.  They have exquisite specificity when you get sick and you get an immune  response. You develop antibodies and other cells that are able to  recognize exactly some piece of that virus or bacterium that has  infected you and mount an immune response.</p> <p>But all of the things  that are doing that are proteins. And the sort of, most of you I think  know that, as we've sort of said that amino acids are just a chain, one  amino acid joined to another amino acid to another amino acid and so on.  And so the backbone, that peptide bond that I showed the other day is  absolutely regular piece of backbone.</p> <p>And what gives the amino  acids their character is the side chain that hangs off. And you'll have  different side chains hanging off depending on what the amino acid is.  And you will not have to memorize all of those structures. But the  important thing is that these various amino acids fit into chemical  categories that give them properties. They either have a plus charge and  a negative charge, they're hydrophobic, they don't like to go with  water, they are polar, they cannot interact with water and so on.</p> <p>And  it's clear from a couple of your comments, some of you are why are we  going through all of this? Well, the reason we're going through all of  this is all amino acids look like this. It doesn't matter. They're going  to be an enzyme, a part of a motor, a structural part of yourselves.  They all consist of the same backbone made up of those 20 amino acids.  And what gives these, makes the proteins so important is the ultimate  3-dimensional structure.</p> <p>I'm not sure what this sound is. OK.  Let's try standing back here. What gives all of these proteins their  individual character is how this chain of amino acids, you could just  think of them like this, folds up into some 3-dimensional structure that  ultimately is able to do the biological function that we're trying to  understand. And one of the real holy grails still in biology is how to  look at the sequence of amino acids that constitute a protein and figure  out what the 3-dimensional structure is.</p> <p>It's one of the holy  grails that hasn't been solved. One of you may have a key insight that  will solve this. If we could do that it would really be a huge advance,  because what you can get out of the genome sequences is you can read the  sequence of every gene and you can predict the sequence of amino acids  in the protein. But all it tells you is the linear sequence of the amino  acids.</p> <p>It doesn't tell you what the 3-dimensional structure is.  And how an amino acid gets from the sort of floppy chain linear  structure to the 3-dimensional thing is complicated. And you have to  understand several kinds of forces. And so I introduced a few terms.  When we think about protein structure, the primary structure, that's  just the linear sequence -- -- of amino acids. So valine followed by a  tryptophan, followed by a proline, followed a threonine, whatever it  would be.</p> <p>That doesn't tell you very much. Then the first key part  of understanding how proteins get to a 3-dimensional structure was the  discovery of what's termed secondary structure. And these are the thing I  introduced to you to the other day. There are two important ones. An  alpha helix and a beta sheet. And this is a propensity of a certain  string of amino acids in this linear sequence to adopt one of two very  common protein structures.</p> <p>And the important thing about these  elements, the alpha helices and the beta sheets is they are not  dependent on the side chain. So they are not. They are instead dependent  on hydrogen bonds -- -- between N-H and the carbon double bond oxygen  in the backbone. And that was how Linus Pauling figured out originally  the alpha helix. He decided to ignore all the side chains. And he worked  out that you could arrange the backbone of a protein, the peptide bonds  into these repeating structures that would account for the reflections  he'd seen.</p> <p>When we get to talking about how Watson and Crick  worked out the structure, that's how they started out, too. They decided  to ignore, if you will, the side chains, which are the As and Gs and Cs  and Ts, which turned out to be not a productive way to go after the  structure of DNA. But, in any case, that was part of what Linus Pauling  did in working these out. And so those little movies I showed you, this  is an alpha helix.</p> <p>Now, what's been done in this picture is all  the side chains have been taken off. And so you can look at this in your  textbook, you'll see pictures, but these hydrogen bonds are -- The  amino acid is just in this helix. It's coiling around. And at regular  intervals there's the opportunity for forming a hydrogen bond. And we  can, with some success but certainly not certainty, predict that a  particular sequence of amino acids is going to form an alpha helix.</p> <p>And  part of what that's based on is there are some amino acids that don't  fit easily into an alpha helix, so they'll disrupt one if it ever tried  to form. So that's one of the elements of protein structure. So what you  might get from this is the idea that somewhere along here this little  piece of the linear sequence is apt to be an alpha helix. And you can  represent that as this little sort of coil that you see in these  3-dimensional structures.</p> <p>The other one, which is the beta sheet,  now that involves interactions between two pieces of, two stretches of  amino acids. Maybe there was a loop in between. And then you can get  interactions between them. And that, oops. Let me just go, there's the  beta sheet interaction. Now, those are represented as arrows. You know,  it takes two of them to go. So you've got to have, to represent a beta  sheet in a 3-dimensional structure you have to have two of those broad  arrows.</p> <p>And there was a question why were there arrows on them?  Well, one of the things, I think you can see if you look at those  backbones, is that both nucleic acid and protein backbones, there's a  polarity. If you start in this direction, the amino terminus, it's got a  particular direction. It's not symmetric. If you come back the other  way you find carboxyl, amino, the alpha carbon.</p> <p>And you'll find it  in the opposite order if you come back the other way. So there's an  inherent polarity. The arrows aren't represented on here, but they are  when you look at it in 3-dimensions. And you can either form beta sheets  where the two strands have the same polarity or, if in a case like that  where they loop back, then of course if this one was pointing in this  direction as it goes through the loop then the opposite strand will be  pointing in the other polarity, one going this way and one going that  way.</p> <p>So this part is sort of helpful. You can make guesses that  maybe this part has a tendency over here to form a beta sheet, but you  still haven't gotten very far towards understanding how you get to the  3-dimensional structure. And just by putting on and superimposing some  amino acids onto that alpha helix then you can see what happens, that if  you form an alpha helix what happens is all the side chains stick out.</p> <p>And  now I think you can see, those of you who are engineers anyway, if you  wanted to build something you have a cylinder and you can stick amino  acids out that have particular chemical characteristics. And depending  on the characteristics of those amino acids, whether they have charges  on them or if they hate water or something, that will influence what  happens to that component of the protein structure when it gets into a  3-dimensional thing.</p> <p>And, as I think I showed you the other day,  when we caught it looking down the end on this particular example, here  are a couple of aromatic amino acids right here, they're on the same  side of the helix and they would hate water. Whereas, some of the other  amino acids up here are ones that have charges so those would love  water. So what this would look like is a cylinder part of which hated  water and part of which loved water.</p> <p>And you might guess it folded  up in 3-dimensional space. The part that hated water might fold towards  the inside of the protein. And the part of the cylinder that loved  water would face to the outside. So that's sort of the underlying  principle. So the rest of the other forces that we had to understand in  order to get to what's called the tertiary structure, this is the full  3D structure, which we can now determine by a variety of methods.</p> <p>X-ray  crystallography of proteins is probably the most common. The NMR, for  example, can be used to derive a 3-dimensional structure as well. And  the other forces then that go into this are ionic forces. Someone seemed  confused by this, but if you have a plus charge on this part of an  amino acid and a minus charge here, if in 3-dimensional space the plus  charge got somewhere near the minus charge then that would form an ionic  bond.</p> <p>And I think most of you know enough electricity and  magnetism that wouldn't surprise you that those two would be attracted.  The one that I think that has been harder to understand is van der Waals  interactions that we talked about the other day, which is tricky in the  sense that for this course you don't particularly really need to  understand the underlying chemistry.</p> <p>But the principal of it is  that if you have a nonpolar bond, one that hasn't got any particular  attraction to it, gets very, very close to another one, then the  transient fluctuations in one induce something in the other one that  makes them stick together. And the whole point about this is if you get  two molecular surfaces that are very, very close together, about, you  know, many two times the length of a covalent bond or something, then  you can generate very powerful forces.</p> <p>Because even though each  individual interaction is weak, about a quarter or a third of a hydrogen  bond, summing them up can make them very, very strong. And so that's  another kind of force that's important when a linear molecule is trying  to figure out how in space it's going to fold up. The point of the gecko  thing was it's only relatively recently been discovered that the reason  those lizards can stick to walls is they have sort of incredible split  ends.</p> <p>I noticed a couple of you came to Bob Full's talk the other  day and you got to hear the full treatment. But because the hairs on  their feet are so split they're very fine and the molecules are able to  make very close interactions, van der Waals interactions with the  surface. And that's what's holding the gecko to the wall. And there are  just so many of them that it can support a whole gecko.</p> <p>And that's  what could be the basis of, he said to me, a $30 to $50 billion  adhesive industry, a self-cleaning dry adhesive. And it's not something  magic only the gecko hair will do. You can design synthetic molecules  that have the same property and are able to make these millions of van  der Waals interactions. So that's two of the other things.</p> <p>And the  final thing, which isn't really a force but goes into this, is this  hydrophobic effect. And that is that if we have things, amino acids such  as valine or something that doesn't like to mix with water, then when  the protein folds up, the things that don't like to interact with water  will kind of go together just the way if you put a lot of oil in the  water it will sort of pull together.</p> <p>Because any time you have  something that gets stuck in water, it disrupts hydrogen bonds and  that's energetically unfavorable. So the things that hate water will  tend to lump together. And you're all used to seeing little drops of oil  and stuff floating around. And let me switch over to this other thing  now. So this was just showing you one of these protein chains that's  folded up into a 3-dimensional structure.</p> <p>This happens to be  something with an enzymatic activity. But the important thing for right  now is what's been colored in here are the amino acids that if you look  back on the list of amino acids and what categories are, you'd see some  of them are said to have hydrophobic side chains. You can see quite  strikingly how the amino acids in the interior part of this protein have  clustered together.</p> <p>They don't like to interact with water. They  interact very well with each other. Just like you can mix butter and  oil, they mix together very well. And so that is another factor that  contributes to the 3-dimensional structure of these proteins. So  understanding what proteins are all about means ultimately understanding  their 3-dimensional structure. And, as I say, a big unsolved problem  right at the moment is how do you get from a linear chain of amino acids  to one of these 3-dimensional structures? And you can imagine with 20  different side chains there's an unbelievable number of combinations  that you can make.</p> <p>Yet almost every protein in nature has one  unique or one or two or something confirmations that takes out, out of  all the kinds of things that you could do. And it's this combination of  forces that does that. You know, let me just go back for one second. So  the final thing that ones talks about when you're talking about proteins  are quaternary structure. And what that means is when you have more  than one polypeptide chain, so if we have two different proteins that  interact, this is protein number one and this is protein number two,  then there has to be some sort of interaction between each of these  three dimensional structures in order for the proteins to stick  together.</p> <p>Something like that flagellar motor that let's the  bacteria swim, has many, many parts, all of which have to fit together  just the same way all the different parts of an engine have to fit  together. Now this next little movie is just a dimer. It's actually a  heterodimer so it's made of two proteins. They're different but they've  come together and they're interaction.</p> <p>So what you will first see  is the 3-dimensional structure of each protein showing the alpha  helices, the beta sheets, and nothing else is shown. The side chains  aren't shown. The molecular surfaces aren't shown. You can just see the  backbone. You'll see alpha helix a turn, some beta sheets, just the kind  of stuff you were seeing the other day. But you'll see that the two  proteins are together.</p> <p>And this is actually a movie made by Tom  Schwartz who's a crystallogram who just started on our facility this  fall in the biology department. It's one of the proteins he studied. And  then after that he rotates it around so you can see it. After that he  then puts on the side chains and then traces the surface. So this is  what they call the van der Waals surface. So this is what the protein  would actually look like.</p> <p>And what I think you'll see from this is  how incredibly well the proteins fit together. The theme I'll probably  keep saying all the way through the course is biology works from fitting  shapes. And things have to work incredibly well, and that's also why  these van der Waals forces become so important. Because evolution has  ended up making things that just go together just like a hand in a  perfectly fit glove.</p> <p>That's the way most of these interactions  are. So watch this little movie. So the light blue is one of the  proteins. There's an alpha helix. There are a lot of alpha helices in  this one. And the purple one is the other protein. And you can see that  in between them there's an interface. And so those must be interacting.  But when he superimposes now all the amino acids in the surface, now  what he's going to do, he's going to pull those apart so you can see  where they were interacting.</p> <p>Do you get the idea now of how  beautifully these things have folded up in 3-dimensional space in  positions so that they can fit together and work together as a machine?  Just the same way if you were building a machine and you needed to have  two parts that you had to join together you've got a tool thing so that  the surfaces go exactly together. That's what nature does.</p> <p>That's  also why I'm making such a deal out of this 3-dimensioanl structure of  proteins and how it got there. I could just say it gets there by magic,  but it doesn't. It's determined by this set of forces. And one of the  things we cannot do at this point is predict. Here's a linear sequence  of amino acids. Here's the 3D structure. That would be a huge advance in  biology if one of you guys could figure out how to do that during your  career.</p> <p>OK. So I just want to reiterate some of the things that  proteins do because we'll be talking about them as we go along. One  thing they do, they act as enzymes which are catalysts for biological  reactions that take place under physiological conditions. And we'll give  you a lot of examples of those enzymes starting very soon. They play  structural roles.</p> <p>Our hair, our fingernails are made of protein.  The hairs on the gecko's feet are made of keratin which is the same  stuff our hair is made of, except they basically got a whole lot of  split ends. They're finer hairs to begin with and a lot of split ends.  And that's what makes these very, very fine things that can make van der  Waals interactions with surfaces. They play roles in specificity.</p> <p>For  example, I mentioned the antibodies. And we'll talk about the immune  response in some detail at the end of the course. And one of the really  magic things that we've come to understand in biology recently is how it  is that your body has this immune system that's able to recognize  literally any molecule, any molecule. It doesn't matter whether it is  existed or you and your PhD thesis in chemistry synthesize something the  world has never seen before, your immune system can create an antibody  or something that will very, very specifically recognize that particular  shape in just the same sort of way that you saw the shape on that  movie.</p> <p>And you might think you'd need to code a zillion millions  of DNA in order to do that. But there's a trick using combinatorial  functions and mutation that lets your body do that. Another example,  which I was showing you, that can do all sorts of little motors and  machines, I showed you the bacteria swimming around. These are just E.  coli. And you cannot see the flagellar motors, but you can see them  buzzing around just under a cover slip.</p> <p>Some of them are stuck to  the cover slip. There we go. In this one, which was taken by Howard  Burge who is a professor at Harvard, I just took this off his website,  you can see the bacteria swimming by having these flagella which are  basically like sort of propellers more or less that they turn. Here's  one where he used the strobe so you can get a little bit better view of  it. And I showed you this picture in the first lecture.</p> <p>So that's  the machine, but every single part of that machine is made of a protein  that's got a very certain 3-dimensional space. And we're going to start  talking about energetics, how does this cell get energy? And one of the  things you might wonder is if you were to design such a nano machine how  would you power it? They exist. I mean it's here.</p> <p>But that's why  in part I'm going to start talking about energy and how cells make  energy, because this is one of the things they have to do. And that was,  as I said, was an average electron micrograph of a lot of those motors.  So you can see that although, you know, that's the textbook thing, the  actual thing is pretty much the same shape. This is not at a resolution  where you can make out the individual proteins that put it together, but  some of those are starting to be known in 3-dimensional detail.</p> <p>And  I thought you might enjoy seeing this just to convince you it's a  motor. In this thing, what Howard Burge did was he stuck the propeller,  if you will, the flagellar to a cover slip using an antibody. And then  he let them do their thing. And normally they would be turning the  propeller and swimming, but if the propeller is attached the same thing  would happen if you held onto the propeller of a boat and turned on the  motor the boat would start twirling around.</p> <p>And what you're seeing  here is bacterial that are twirling around because their flagellar are  stuck on. And those of you who are observant will notice even that they  change direction. And that's part of the system that bacteria use so  they can swim towards a food source or away from another one. OK. Here's  just something to let you think about it. If anybody can figure this  out send me an email.</p> <p>Here's something else. The phenomenon I'm  going to show you is due to a protein made by a soil bacterium called  Pseudomonas syringae. You don't need to know that. It associated with  plants. And what you're going to see is a little movie made by a couple  of post-docs in my lab where they took pure water. And if it's pure  water you can cool it below freezing.</p> <p>You can get it down to, I  don't know, minus eight degrees centigrade and it still will be a  liquid, even though you know water freezes at zero degrees centigrade.  And what it has to do in order to turn into ice, somewhere you have to  nucleate the formation of an ice crystal. And once it goes, going. So,  anyway, what you're going to see is some super- cooled water they've  made.</p> <p>You can see there is zero degrees there. And this is  Metchitaga, one of the post-docs in my lab. That's the super-cooled  water. She's taking a little bit of culture of this Pseudomonas  syringae, and she's just going to put it in, give a little tiny squirt, a  few micro-liters into that water. Now it's going all cloudy. And now  you might wonder what's happening there. But, as you'll discovery, what  happened is that what was liquid water is now ice.</p> <p>That is due to  one protein that this bacterium makes and displays on its surface. And  here's a controlled experiment. This is putting in a little bit of  rhizobium meliloti, another soil organism, and the same amount of  bacteria. It didn't happen. OK. So that's due to a protein that was on  the surface of that bacterium. Anybody have any idea what that could do?  Send me an email. OK. There's one last class of biological  macromolecule.</p> <p>Those are lipids. These are a little different in  the sense that this is not know a long chain made by joining together  subunits as you see with the proteins and nucleic acids, but putting  together the parts necessary to make a lipid involve the same principle,  that you end up splitting out water molecules. That's a theme you've  heard over and over again. And if we take three long chain, three fatty  acids, some number of carbons -- Some number of carbons.</p> <p>Just some  arbitrary number here. And then we take a three carbon compound that  has three hydroxyl groups. Now, this is not a carbohydrate because  you'll notice there's not a double bond oxygen as you saw in the  carbohydrates. It's actually an alcohol that's known as glycerol. And if  we split out water like this what you get is a fat, something you're  familiar with from beef fat. Or if you get something like olive oil,  you've heard the term unsaturated fats.</p> <p>Maybe you'll recall from  the second lecture that if we had a single covalent bond, or if we had a  double or a triple bond that was called an unsaturated bond. So if you  have an unsaturated bond in here somewhere then you end up with an  unsaturated fat. And most of you know probably something like beef fat  is solid. If you put it in a refrigerator something like peanut oil will  stay liquid.</p> <p>And that's because if you have just saturated side  chains from this then they pack together very tightly and they will form  a solid. If you put a double bond in then there's a kink in the  backbone and it's hard for these things to pack together. And that's why  they're called unsaturated fats. Now, there's a very particular kind of  lipid that's of unbelievable importance in biology known as a  phospholipid.</p> <p>And the reason that's so important is that that is  the boundary that determines the outside of a cell. So every cell, every  organism either is a single cell or is made up of multiple cells. And,  as I said in the first lecture, that one of the secrets to life is  having a boundary that goes around your insides it separates your  insides from all the rest of the universe.</p> <p>And the way these  membranes, as they're called, are made of is what's known as a  phospholipid bilayer. And it's the same principle as before. It uses a  glycerol, except that one of the fatty acids is replaced by a phosphate  group that will have some kind decoration added onto it. And the other  will have fatty acids at the other two positions. Now, you'll notice by  splitting out water here, the kind of bond that we have created, the  chemical name of this is an ester bond.</p> <p>And if we wanted to break  it we could add water back across it. So what's important about this  molecule is this part of the molecule, if you will, is water-loving  because the very polar bonds here, the oxygen here would have a negative  charge under physiological conditions. And this part is, if you will,  water-hating. So phospholipids are often represented in the following  way where this is the water-loving and then this would be the  water-hating part here.</p> <p>And so if you take phospholipids and you  just try and disperse them in water, they spontaneously self-assemble  into structures that bring the water-loving parts together and the  water-hating parts together. And by so doing this they form what's known  as a phospholipid bilayer. And that's what this membrane is made of.  Membrane of bacterial cell, membrane of our cells virtually the same  thing. It has the property that is not permeable to very much.</p> <p>Water  can get across a very limited number of other chemical compounds, but  most things cannot. And so, by having this membrane, what the cell is  able to do then is control who comes in and who comes out. And the way  it does that is it has to put particular importers or exporters imbedded  in the membrane that can carry out those functions. Because, as you  would guess, any system would have to bring stuff in, get rid of waste,  you'd have to be able to go back and forth.</p> <p>The things that do all  those transports across the membrane are, what kind of molecule do you  think it likely to be? If nature was going to design something that was a  pump to get something in or something that would get something out, any  idea what kind of molecule? Take a guess given what I've said so far.  Protein. Yeah. Absolutely. And let me just sort of show you a couple  little pictures here.</p> <p>So here's a representation of this  phospholipid bilayer. This is pretty standard stuff. This is what you'd  put on a blackboard. Here's in gray now the phospholipid. And here's one  of these proteins, a picture of one of these proteins that functions to  get things across the membrane. And hopefully what you can see now is  that it's made up of a whole lot of alpha helices, and they pack  together to give sort of a cylinder made up of different alpha helices  that weave in out like this.</p> <p>And then by this sort of trick the  protein is able to create a channel that runs up and down the middle of  this protein that's imbedded in the membrane. And then, depending on the  characteristics that channel, it can either be used to bring stuff in  or get rid of it. There is a more fanciful depiction of it. This is not  reality, but there you are with the water-loving parts.</p> <p>Here are  the fatty acids going in. And this is supposed to be one of these  membrane proteins. Now, this next movie is trying to pretend here that  it's looking at one of these membrane proteins colored here in red as it  spans the membrane. So here's looking from the membrane surface on. And  now it's going to dive into this thing as it crossed the membrane.</p> <p>And  basically what this movie is letting you do is feel like if you were  the molecule that's being transported across the membrane you'd see how  you'd go right down through a channel in the middle of the protein. So  that's one of the underlying principals then, is that you have a  phospholipid boundary that's critical for life. But then to have  everything else that needs to happen the cell makes a series of proteins  that function either to bring stuff in or to bring it out.</p> <p>Or in  the case of something like the flagellar motor we talked about it has to  imbed a part of the machinery right in the membrane. And one last  picture I just want to show you. Usually, even on that movie, you tend  to see the cell represented something like this with a membrane and  every once in a while there's a protein. This is a cartoon but it is  much closer to a to-scale drawing.</p> <p>This is an E. coli cell. Now,  they have an extra membrane that we won't worry about right for the  moment. But right there, this little piece that we can see little bits  of, is the cell's membrane. And what this picture is showing is that  this membrane is just absolutely studded with membrane proteins that are  going to carry out various functions. And here actually we're seeing  that motor which is imbedded both in the inner and outer membrane.</p> <p>And  there's the motor going off. But a couple of things maybe you can take  home from this is there are a lot of proteins stuck in those membranes  that control what goes in and out. You also get a sense in here of how  crowded the cytoplasm is. The proteins are really at amazingly high  concentrations when they're inside the cytoplasm. OK. So that's sort of a  quick survey.</p> <p>It's nothing more that a really superficial  introduction to the four classes of biomolecules. But to go any farther  we're going to have to think a little bit now about of the  characteristics of living cells. I don't know if any of you know if any  of you know what this is, but this is bakers yeast. If you were making  bread you know you put some yeast in it and it divides and it gives off  carbon dioxide as a waste product and makes the bread rise.</p> <p>And  what's happened in that little movie you just saw were two cells  dividing to give four, and four dividing to get eight, and I don't know  what we're up to here, but you can see a cell grow. That's sped up. It  takes probably something closer to an hour for a cell division to take  place. But this is the kind of thing that microorganisms do when they  grow, is you can start with a single cell and it will make two cells  that are identical to itself and those will make four.</p> <p>And what  happens when we start out as a single cell, we start out initially like  this. And we make cells that are identical at the beginning. And those  are the famous embryonic stem cells, because at this point they can  become any cell in your body. And if you're a yeast it doesn't matter.  Everything you make is the same. If it's a human, once you start  dividing at some point cells are going to have to start making decisions  and the progeny will have to start to be different of each other so  that you can have something that's an eye and another cell that's in the  liver and so on.</p> <p>And we'll talk a little bit about that as we go  on. But the major point, right at this point, is that all of life  involves one cell dividing and giving a couple of other cells, and then  those going on. So these cells, as we've said, characteristics of  organisms which are to be true at their cellular level as well is that  they carry out metabolism, they undergo regulated growth.</p> <p>And you  have a nice example of yeast undergoing regulated growth and they  reproduce, which in the case of a single-celled organism is the same as  cell division. For us reproducing is a lot more complicated because we  have to make a whole other multicellular organism where the cells have  differentiated functions, but the point about that is there has to be an  unbelievable amount of synthesis.</p> <p>The DNA in our body, we start  out with two meters in a fertilized cell, and we have ten to the  fourteenth cells by the time we're an adult. So we've had to make a  tremendous amount of DNA let alone protein and everything else. And  something almost all of you know from your engineering background from  this place is that you need energy in order to synthesize material.</p> <p>And  what we'll start to talk about in the next phase of this course then is  how do cells make energy and how do they carry out metabolism. So I'm  going to, just before we do that, introduce to you very quickly, to  close out here, two classes of organisms that we find in nature. We find  organisms that are known as autotrophs. These are certain bacteria, and  they're able to make everything they need starting with CO2, ammonia,  phosphate, water, a few things, but that's all they need.</p> <p>So, for  example, an organism that lives, a bacterium that lives out in the open  ocean is able to make everything from those very, very simple basic  building blocks. Heterotrophs need to eat -- -- some things made by  other organisms. An example of a heterotroph that you're familiar with,  that I'm familiar with is us. You probably remember your mother  reminding you, as you're about to have yet another hotdog, that it was  important to eat your vitamins.</p> <p>The reason you need to eat  vitamins, those are things we absolutely need for our life but we cannot  make them ourselves. Vitamin C is one you probably know. It has an  interesting history how people figured this out. It was sailors at sea  got really, really sick. Their teeth would start to loosen, they would  start to bleed and they would die. Some of the famous sea voyages you  heard about in high school, I think the Cape of Good Hope, on that trip  where that was discovered 100 out of the 160 sailors died at sea because  of scurvy.</p> <p>Now, scurvy turns out to be due to not having vitamin  C. And there was finally a guy, Lind, I'm just blanking on his first  name at the moment, in about the 1700s who was a naval surgeon in the  British Navy who actually figured out that if you gave sailors lemon  juice that they didn't get scurvy. It was a controlled experiment. It  took about 50 years. I think it was 1795 when they started to finally  give the sailors lemon juice and stopped having this terrible sickness  amongst their sailors.</p> <p>And then in about 1950 they substituted  lime juice. And some of you may still know the British sailors are  called "limeys". And that was because of this solution they found to  avoiding scurvy. And what was really happening was they were finding a  way to provide vitamin C which is in fresh fruits and vegetables which  wasn't part of the classic sailor diet which was sort of biscuits and  dried meat during long voyages at sea.</p> <p>And there are several other  vitamins, but the reason they're called vitamins is they're things that  you body cannot make but other organisms can. The other thing that we  cannot make, we can make some of our 20 amino acids, but there are eight  amino acids that we cannot make, lysine, methionine, lucien,  isoleucine, valine, threonine, phenylalanine and tryptophan. And this  actually has consequences for us because those of you who are  vegetarians probably know you have to be kind of careful about your  diet.</p> <p>If you're eating animal protein you're getting essentially  all the different amino acids, but if you're a vegetarian you have to be  careful because the major food crops such as wheat and rice, for  example, are very low in lysine. So if you just eat those you end up  with a lysine deficiency that's not good. But, on the other hand, beans,  lentils, the various leguminous plants, which also are those ones that  form the special associations with bacteria that let them convert  atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, legumes are high in lysine but low in  methionine.</p> <p>So peoples all over the world figured this out by  trial and error. So the Mexican diet is rice and beans. There's a reason  for it. What's happening actually is just in the rice you're low in  lysine, but by having beans at the same time you're balancing out the  two. Or the Native Americans in this pat of the country had "the three  sisters" with the corn, the squash and the beans.</p> <p>And again they  were balancing out the diet by making sure that they got the various  amino acids, a balance of all the amino acids that were necessary for  life. It also actually was really good gardening practice because the  beans were able to convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, which was  fertilizer, and the squash leaves shaded the ground so that the ground  didn't dry out, and the corn could grow even when it was short on water.</p> <p>But  what was really happening, as people grew without even understanding  about chemistry, they were compensating for the fact that we're  heterotrophs and needed to do this. So we'll start in the next lecture  on trying to talk about how cells make energy and how it makes some of  this amazing stuff happen.</p>
