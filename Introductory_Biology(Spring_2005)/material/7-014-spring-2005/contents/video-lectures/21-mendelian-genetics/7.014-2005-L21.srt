1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
So, we have another kind of very
interesting piece of the course

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:09
right now.  We're going to continue
to talk about genetics,

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:14
except now we're going to talk about
the genetics of diploid organisms,

4
00:00:14 --> 00:00:19
which apart from bacteria, most of
the organisms including us are

5
00:00:19 --> 00:00:23
diploid.  They have more than one
copy of each chromosome,

6
00:00:23 --> 00:00:28
and so we'll go through a segment on
this, and also talk about mitosis

7
00:00:28 --> 00:00:33
and meiosis, the central processes
of cell division and the segregation

8
00:00:33 --> 00:00:38
of genetic material that underlie
life as we know it.

9
00:00:38 --> 00:00:42
And then, were going to charge into
a session of recombinant DNA,

10
00:00:42 --> 00:00:46
and some of these technologies,
PCR and various things that you see

11
00:00:46 --> 00:00:50
in the newspapers all the time.
And then, I'll finish up with the

12
00:00:50 --> 00:00:55
session on the immune system,
which a few of you thought was

13
00:00:55 --> 00:00:59
surprising that bacteria recombines.
I'll tell you in that system it

14
00:00:59 --> 00:01:03
will feel like science fiction
relative to what I've told

15
00:01:03 --> 00:01:08
you up to now.
It's an absolutely amazing system.

16
00:01:08 --> 00:01:13
So, we are going to start today
with genetics of diploid organisms.

17
00:01:13 --> 00:01:17
So I'm going to go back to how this
was first understood.

18
00:01:17 --> 00:01:22
And most of you have probably heard
of Gregor Mendel,

19
00:01:22 --> 00:01:27
who discovered this,
and surely some fraction of you have

20
00:01:27 --> 00:01:32
run into an exposure to this topic
before.  But in keeping with what

21
00:01:32 --> 00:01:37
I'm trying to do in this course,
could you guys watch out there?

22
00:01:37 --> 00:01:41
I think I'm just going to unplug,
yeah, it's OK.  I think I'm just

23
00:01:41 --> 00:01:45
going to unplug it for just a minute
here.  You've probably heard of

24
00:01:45 --> 00:01:49
Mendel.  Some of you have seen these
different squares.

25
00:01:49 --> 00:01:53
You might have memorized it from a
textbook or something like that.

26
00:01:53 --> 00:01:57
I'm going to try and see if we can
go through this material up another

27
00:01:57 --> 00:02:01
level of sophistication because,
again, and I'm saying, science

28
00:02:01 --> 00:02:05
didn't just come down from on high
and end up with facts

29
00:02:05 --> 00:02:09
in a textbook.
What's in a textbook is somebody's

30
00:02:09 --> 00:02:13
effort to take a current state of
understanding which is based on

31
00:02:13 --> 00:02:17
experimentation and come up with
models.  And what you're seeing in

32
00:02:17 --> 00:02:21
the textbooks are the models such as
they were as of the time the

33
00:02:21 --> 00:02:25
textbook was submitted for
publication.  Sometimes they change

34
00:02:25 --> 00:02:30
even before the textbooks get out.
But anyway, it's a process.

35
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
Mendel was one of the starting
people who started this process,

36
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
really a key figure, and a guy with
an amazing intellect.

37
00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
But before we start in,
I just want to show you a couple of

38
00:02:40 --> 00:02:44
pictures because these kind of
knocked me over when I saw them.

39
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
I don't know what kind of image you
have of Mendel.

40
00:02:47 --> 00:02:51
You probably know he was a monk,
and he did something with peas, and

41
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54
he figured out this stuff about
genetics.  And most people probably

42
00:02:54 --> 00:02:58
carry around an image probably
somewhat like this sort of

43
00:02:58 --> 00:03:02
romanticized drawing.
He was a monk all right,

44
00:03:02 --> 00:03:07
but it was at an Augustine monastery
in Bruno in Austria that was a very

45
00:03:07 --> 00:03:13
major intellectual center.
They even published a scientific

46
00:03:13 --> 00:03:18
journal.  They sent Mendel off to
Vienna to go to university.

47
00:03:18 --> 00:03:23
While he was there, he studied
physics, math,

48
00:03:23 --> 00:03:29
as well as botany.
So he had, in many ways,

49
00:03:29 --> 00:03:34
a background that is very similar to
you guys, very heavy on the

50
00:03:34 --> 00:03:40
quantitative physical science,
mathematical sort of background.

51
00:03:40 --> 00:03:44
And then he went on to do some
experiments in biology.

52
00:03:44 --> 00:03:48
And I think you maybe can get a
sense of this.

53
00:03:48 --> 00:03:52
You can see a picture of what
Mendel actually looked like.

54
00:03:52 --> 00:03:56
Here's one picture of him.  But the
one that really blew me away,

55
00:03:56 --> 00:04:00
I have a picture of the monks.
Just think of what ever image you

56
00:04:00 --> 00:04:04
had of the monks that
Mendel was at.

57
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
Well there's a picture of them.
To me, they look nothing so much

58
00:04:07 --> 00:04:11
like a group of university
presidents or something sitting

59
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
around for a portrait.
And he traveled very widely.

60
00:04:14 --> 00:04:18
Here he was on his way to London
here.  Here is a picture of him with

61
00:04:18 --> 00:04:22
a group of people on his way to,
I think he was in Paris on his way

62
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
to London.  So this wasn't a little
isolated monk in a garden who

63
00:04:25 --> 00:04:29
stumbled across stuff.
He was a rather sophisticated guy

64
00:04:29 --> 00:04:33
going after some interesting
problems.

65
00:04:33 --> 00:04:37
And this was the garden in which he
did his experiments.

66
00:04:37 --> 00:04:42
Here's a picture of it.
So this was a straightforward

67
00:04:42 --> 00:04:47
experimental setup for these really
amazing things he did.

68
00:04:47 --> 00:04:52
So, with that kind of background,
Mendel was interested in a problem

69
00:04:52 --> 00:04:57
of inheritance.
And people have been aware that

70
00:04:57 --> 00:05:02
traits were inherited.
That was the whole principle of

71
00:05:02 --> 00:05:06
domesticating animals and
domesticating crops,

72
00:05:06 --> 00:05:11
that if you took parents with
certain characteristics and crossed

73
00:05:11 --> 00:05:15
them together,
the offspring then had the traits

74
00:05:15 --> 00:05:20
that were associated with the
parents.  And so people have able to

75
00:05:20 --> 00:05:24
get better domesticated animals or
better domesticated crops.

76
00:05:24 --> 00:05:29
But up until then, this mixing was
thought of sort of like blending

77
00:05:29 --> 00:05:33
liquids, stir together some green
and red, and a little

78
00:05:33 --> 00:05:38
this and that.
And it all stirred together.

79
00:05:38 --> 00:05:42
And as you'll see, what one of
Mendel's great insights was,

80
00:05:42 --> 00:05:46
was that it wasn't like mixing
liquids.  And to study this problem,

81
00:05:46 --> 00:05:51
then, he picked a system.  It wasn't
that he was just fiddling around

82
00:05:51 --> 00:05:55
with peas.  He was a pretty
sophisticated guy,

83
00:05:55 --> 00:05:59
and he picked peas as an
experimental organisms

84
00:05:59 --> 00:06:05
for three reasons.
And so, why peas?

85
00:06:05 --> 00:06:11
Well one, they were easy to grow,
and that's still a major

86
00:06:11 --> 00:06:17
consideration of any model system
that you want to use and science

87
00:06:17 --> 00:06:23
today.  It's really tricky to grow,
it's very hard to work with.  It was

88
00:06:23 --> 00:06:30
easy to pollinate in
a controlled way.

89
00:06:30 --> 00:06:35
Just the structure of the pea flower
makes it very easy to make sure to

90
00:06:35 --> 00:06:40
either put the pollen right on the
pistol of that same flower,

91
00:06:40 --> 00:06:45
which is a kind of self
fertilization,

92
00:06:45 --> 00:06:50
or to make sure that the pollen goes
from one flower to another,

93
00:06:50 --> 00:06:55
which is basically cross-pollination.
And the third thing,

94
00:06:55 --> 00:07:00
and this was a really important
thing, was the system had worked on

95
00:07:00 --> 00:07:05
before.  And there were a number of
what were called pure

96
00:07:05 --> 00:07:09
breeding lines.
If he had just grabbed peas out of

97
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
the wild it would be sort of like me
starting to do genetics by crossing

98
00:07:12 --> 00:07:16
a couple of you guys.
We'd get offspring, all right,

99
00:07:16 --> 00:07:19
and we'd cross those offspring, we'd
keep getting things,

100
00:07:19 --> 00:07:22
people that look different and
different, maybe something like the

101
00:07:22 --> 00:07:26
parents, but what had happened with
peas is people had taken a pea,

102
00:07:26 --> 00:07:29
and then they continually inbred it
until it finally sort of settled

103
00:07:29 --> 00:07:33
down.  It always had
white flowers.

104
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
It always had wrinkled seeds.
It always had whatever the

105
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
particular trait was.
And so, I think I showed you the

106
00:07:39 --> 00:07:43
slide earlier.
This shows two things.

107
00:07:43 --> 00:07:46
You can see there are smooth seeds
and then wrinkled seeds.

108
00:07:46 --> 00:07:50
And it may be a little hard to tell
in this light,

109
00:07:50 --> 00:07:53
but there is sort of two colors here.
One's kind of greenish and one's

110
00:07:53 --> 00:07:57
sort of yellowish.
So there, you see two of the traits

111
00:07:57 --> 00:08:00
right there.  There were also flower
colors, and height,

112
00:08:00 --> 00:08:04
and other things that had the
characteristic.

113
00:08:04 --> 00:08:09
They were pure breeding.
Every time you took that line and

114
00:08:09 --> 00:08:14
if you self crossed it and put out
its progeny, you'd see the same

115
00:08:14 --> 00:08:19
characteristic each time.
So, this was the system that Mendel

116
00:08:19 --> 00:08:25
started to study this problem of
inheritance.  And how does blending

117
00:08:25 --> 00:08:30
come together when two organisms
brought pollen?

118
00:08:30 --> 00:08:36
Or, if it was other animals like us,
it would be sperm and egg.

119
00:08:36 --> 00:08:40
But somehow, you did something that
ended up giving you an egg that got

120
00:08:40 --> 00:08:45
fertilized.  And out of that came
the progeny.  So,

121
00:08:45 --> 00:08:50
what Mendel did, the term that's
used, they say he carried out a

122
00:08:50 --> 00:08:55
cross.  This is genetic-speak here
now.  So he took pollen

123
00:08:55 --> 00:09:09
from one plant.

124
00:09:09 --> 00:09:16
And used it to fertilize another
plant, collected the seeds that came

125
00:09:16 --> 00:09:23
out of this, and he examined the
progeny.  And I think an interesting

126
00:09:23 --> 00:09:31
way of thinking about this
is a UROP project.

127
00:09:31 --> 00:09:35
You'd come into Mendel's lab and
wanted to do a UROP project,

128
00:09:35 --> 00:09:39
it was pretty easy.  I could
probably show you all the techniques

129
00:09:39 --> 00:09:43
you needed to know,
and this is it.  You'd show how you

130
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47
pollinate, collect seeds,
and then we'd look at the

131
00:09:47 --> 00:09:51
characteristics.
So, it's just some fairly simple

132
00:09:51 --> 00:09:55
manipulations and some observational
stuff.  So, let's suppose you're

133
00:09:55 --> 00:09:59
doing Mendel's thing as a UROP
project, and let's just see where

134
00:09:59 --> 00:10:05
that will take us.
So, what Mendel did to begin with,

135
00:10:05 --> 00:10:11
he took one of these pure breeding
lines that was smooth or all

136
00:10:11 --> 00:10:17
abbreviated as a capital S.
And he pollinated it with something

137
00:10:17 --> 00:10:24
that was wrinkled.
I'll do that as little S.

138
00:10:24 --> 00:10:30
And then he collected the seeds
from what's known as the first

139
00:10:30 --> 00:10:37
generation, starting with
something like this.

140
00:10:37 --> 00:10:45
And geneticists use the term F1 for
this first generation in a cross

141
00:10:45 --> 00:10:54
like this, and what he found was
everything, all the seeds,

142
00:10:54 --> 00:11:03
were smooth.  So, the wrinkled trait
had, if you will, disappeared.

143
00:11:03 --> 00:11:19
That's your first UROP experiment.

144
00:11:19 --> 00:11:24
[Time doesn't?] submit to nature,
or science, or something,

145
00:11:24 --> 00:11:30
and read a little paper like Watson
and Craig that turns the world on

146
00:11:30 --> 00:11:36
its end.  What would you do next?
No gels, no Whitehead Sequencing

147
00:11:36 --> 00:11:42
Facility.  Anybody got any ideas?
I've showed you all the techniques

148
00:11:42 --> 00:11:49
that he knew about.
Pardon?  Cross it again?

149
00:11:49 --> 00:11:55
What's your thinking?  Do you think
the traits disappear,

150
00:11:55 --> 00:12:02
or do you think it's hiding?
It might be hiding, right?

151
00:12:02 --> 00:12:08
I don't know what he thought,
but I think that's a reasonable to

152
00:12:08 --> 00:12:14
think about it is he's probably
trying to figure out,

153
00:12:14 --> 00:12:20
did this wrinkled trait just
disappear from the face of the Earth,

154
00:12:20 --> 00:12:26
or is it hiding in those
first-generation seeds?

155
00:12:26 --> 00:12:33
So, let's put that up here.
So, that's exactly what he did.

156
00:12:33 --> 00:12:39
So, he took these seeds, now, that
were the smooth F1.

157
00:12:39 --> 00:12:45
These are not the same smooth as
the parental up here.

158
00:12:45 --> 00:12:51
Just to make clear, you guys
understand these are pure breeding.

159
00:12:51 --> 00:12:57
These are the ones that people have
been breeding for a long time,

160
00:12:57 --> 00:13:03
this one and this one.
In this case, even though I'm trying

161
00:13:03 --> 00:13:10
it in circles,
this is a smooth F1,

162
00:13:10 --> 00:13:17
smooth F1.  And, this time when he
did the experiment he looked at the

163
00:13:17 --> 00:13:24
second generation,
or the F2 generation as a geneticist

164
00:13:24 --> 00:13:31
would call it.
What he found,

165
00:13:31 --> 00:13:38
he got some smooth and he got some
wrinkled.

166
00:13:38 --> 00:13:52
So, the wrinkled trait reemerged in
the F2.  So it wasn't really gone.

167
00:13:52 --> 00:14:03
It was hiding.
OK, time to submit to nature's

168
00:14:03 --> 00:14:09
science cell.  Got it?
He didn't try and publish it at

169
00:14:09 --> 00:14:15
that point.  He did something else.
He had the same kind of background

170
00:14:15 --> 00:14:21
you guys have.
Can he think what he might've done?

171
00:14:21 --> 00:14:27
He could cross again.  There's
something else he did with this

172
00:14:27 --> 00:14:33
experiment, though.
Well, you're thinking of new

173
00:14:33 --> 00:14:40
experiments.
He's got a little data processing he

174
00:14:40 --> 00:14:46
can do here.  What did you say?
I'm not able to hear, sorry.

175
00:14:46 --> 00:14:52
Statistics, OK.
I'll simplify it even slightly

176
00:14:52 --> 00:14:58
before that.  I've got some of each.
Count them, right, exactly.  So

177
00:14:58 --> 00:15:04
that's what he did,
and I think the numbers were,

178
00:15:04 --> 00:15:11
if I remember, five, four, seven,
four in 1850.

179
00:15:11 --> 00:15:15
So, what should I do now?
Ratio: absolutely.  We could count

180
00:15:15 --> 00:15:19
another million of them,
but that probably would not be

181
00:15:19 --> 00:15:23
terribly productive.
And what he found out is that when

182
00:15:23 --> 00:15:27
he did that, he found that he got a
ratio that was pretty

183
00:15:27 --> 00:15:35
close to 3:1.
And, so that was sort of what he

184
00:15:35 --> 00:15:46
found out from this by doing this
sort of thing over again was a

185
00:15:46 --> 00:15:58
pattern.  A trait disappeared in the
F1.  The trait reemerged in the F2,

186
00:15:58 --> 00:16:07
and the two traits had this.
The ratio of the two traits would be

187
00:16:07 --> 00:16:13
about 3:1.  If you don't think this
is sort of like a UROP project or

188
00:16:13 --> 00:16:20
something, that's a page out of some
of Mendel's actual notes while he

189
00:16:20 --> 00:16:26
was doing his crosses.
And what he did next, then,

190
00:16:26 --> 00:16:32
was to take some other traits.
Yeah?  Sorry?  Excuse me?

191
00:16:32 --> 00:16:36
Reemerged in F2.  So, he took some
other traits, white and purple

192
00:16:36 --> 00:16:41
flowers, tall,
short, I found that there were at

193
00:16:41 --> 00:16:45
least certain other traits.
It didn't work for everything he

194
00:16:45 --> 00:16:50
studied, but some of them he could
see the same pattern.

195
00:16:50 --> 00:16:54
One of the traits disappeared.
It reemerged in the F2, and when he

196
00:16:54 --> 00:16:59
counted them, he'd find that the
trait that reemerged was at one,

197
00:16:59 --> 00:17:04
and the other one there were three
times as many.

198
00:17:04 --> 00:17:08
So, he'd seen a pattern.
And all he's done at this point is

199
00:17:08 --> 00:17:13
to cross flowers and count the
progeny.  So, at that point Mendel

200
00:17:13 --> 00:17:17
tried to explain his data.
So, he had to, now, take the next

201
00:17:17 --> 00:17:22
part of the scientific process.
And what's kind of nice about

202
00:17:22 --> 00:17:27
thinking about Mendel,
in this sense, is we are not

203
00:17:27 --> 00:17:32
overwhelmed by complicated
techniques.

204
00:17:32 --> 00:17:35
You can see, I think,
the scientific process.

205
00:17:35 --> 00:17:38
And it's a very bare bones thing
marching along.

206
00:17:38 --> 00:17:41
So now he's got some data.
He's quantitated his stuff.

207
00:17:41 --> 00:17:44
He's founded reproducible.  It's
not only for seeds.

208
00:17:44 --> 00:17:47
It seems to be some general feature.
And the thing about this,

209
00:17:47 --> 00:17:51
I guess, I don't know what he
thought but it seems to be likely

210
00:17:51 --> 00:17:54
that he could see that this didn't
fit very well with the blending idea.

211
00:17:54 --> 00:17:57
Like, you'd pour together two
liquids, and you'd

212
00:17:57 --> 00:18:01
stir them all up.
Instead, he really made this

213
00:18:01 --> 00:18:05
monumental leap in thinking that
genetic information must come in

214
00:18:05 --> 00:18:09
some sort of particular form,
come in particles, or units, or

215
00:18:09 --> 00:18:14
quanta if you want to think about if
it if you're a physicist.

216
00:18:14 --> 00:18:18
We know those units as genes right
now.  We grow up with it right now,

217
00:18:18 --> 00:18:22
but to go from the idea that genetic
information was kind of like two

218
00:18:22 --> 00:18:27
liquids blending to the idea it was
a little particle,

219
00:18:27 --> 00:18:31
so it was just about the same kind
of leap as thinking that energy

220
00:18:31 --> 00:18:36
comes in particles instead of a
continuous sort of thing.

221
00:18:36 --> 00:18:48
So, that was the kind of insight
that Mendel had.

222
00:18:48 --> 00:19:00
And so genetic info comes in
particles, units.

223
00:19:00 --> 00:19:05
I was going to say,
we now call these genes,

224
00:19:05 --> 00:19:11
and if that was what it was then he
started to think about these traits

225
00:19:11 --> 00:19:16
as particles that had a different
character associated with each of

226
00:19:16 --> 00:19:22
them.  That would mean there would
be one particle that was a big S,

227
00:19:22 --> 00:19:28
and that was smooth.  There was some
other particle that was specified.

228
00:19:28 --> 00:19:34
The wrinkled character, that would
be called a small s.

229
00:19:34 --> 00:19:38
So, what was happening in these
crosses, then,

230
00:19:38 --> 00:19:42
he was now mixing particles instead
of liquids.  Again,

231
00:19:42 --> 00:19:46
I don't know how he got to,
how many particles there had to be

232
00:19:46 --> 00:19:50
of each per organism.
It could have been anywhere from

233
00:19:50 --> 00:19:54
two upwards.  He had to have two in
order to explain the sort of stuff

234
00:19:54 --> 00:19:58
he was working with.
There's no reason he couldn't have

235
00:19:58 --> 00:20:03
thought of 12 or something.
But I assume you start with the very

236
00:20:03 --> 00:20:11
simplest thing,
number that you can think of,

237
00:20:11 --> 00:20:18
and see if you can make this work.
So, what he hypothesized, then, was

238
00:20:18 --> 00:20:26
that each organism had two copies of
each of these particles.

239
00:20:26 --> 00:20:34
So, two copies of each particle,
so this would mean that there were

240
00:20:34 --> 00:20:41
two types of particles.
So, there would be the S and the

241
00:20:41 --> 00:20:48
smooth.  So, he can get three types
of things.  He could get one that

242
00:20:48 --> 00:20:55
was both big S or smooth.
Or you could have the ones that

243
00:20:55 --> 00:21:03
were the two little S's.
And these would be wrinkled.

244
00:21:03 --> 00:21:09
Or, if you had the other combination,
what he figured out,

245
00:21:09 --> 00:21:15
what fit with this model is these
would have to be smooth.

246
00:21:15 --> 00:21:21
That would have to mean that one of
them is dominant over the other when

247
00:21:21 --> 00:21:27
you put them in combination.
So, in this thing, the big S would

248
00:21:27 --> 00:21:32
be said to be dominant.
And the little s Would be said to be

249
00:21:32 --> 00:21:38
recessive.  There's another little
term here that I'm going to

250
00:21:38 --> 00:21:43
introduce because it'll help us talk
about this stuff over the next few

251
00:21:43 --> 00:21:49
days, terms geneticists use all the
time.  Because these both have two

252
00:21:49 --> 00:21:54
of the same, they're said to be
homozygous, do the same.

253
00:21:54 --> 00:22:00
And this one, with one of each,
is said to be heterozygous.

254
00:22:00 --> 00:22:04
OK, so there is,
I think, sort of the setup for

255
00:22:04 --> 00:22:09
Mendel's model.
He had to contend with one other

256
00:22:09 --> 00:22:14
issue, though,
and that was if every organism has

257
00:22:14 --> 00:22:19
two, and two parents get together
and each donate something,

258
00:22:19 --> 00:22:24
unless you did something, the
offspring would have four.

259
00:22:24 --> 00:22:29
When those offspring got together,
the next one would have twice as

260
00:22:29 --> 00:22:34
many, and so on.
So, from probably,

261
00:22:34 --> 00:22:39
I don't know whether it was just
from first principle,

262
00:22:39 --> 00:22:43
but I would imagine he figured out
that if organisms had sex with

263
00:22:43 --> 00:22:48
pollen and whatever,
or egg and sperm, that something had

264
00:22:48 --> 00:22:53
to be done to get around this
problem of an ever increasing number

265
00:22:53 --> 00:22:57
of particles.  So,
he envisioned that when there were

266
00:22:57 --> 00:23:02
specialized cells for sex,
and that they have the number so

267
00:23:02 --> 00:23:07
that the sex cells would have half
the number of particles so that when

268
00:23:07 --> 00:23:12
each parent donated one, you'd
be back up to two.

269
00:23:12 --> 00:23:18
It's pretty simple,
straightforward thinking once you've

270
00:23:18 --> 00:23:24
gotten the idea that these things
are coming in a particular form.

271
00:23:24 --> 00:23:30
So, with this, could he now explain
his results?

272
00:23:30 --> 00:23:37
Let's do it over here.
So, what happened in the first

273
00:23:37 --> 00:23:45
cross?  He had a smooth,
pure breeding line crossed with,

274
00:23:45 --> 00:23:52
so the sex cells from this, each one
would have been a big S,

275
00:23:52 --> 00:24:00
and the sex cells from each one of
this would have been a little s.

276
00:24:00 --> 00:24:08
And as you recall, what he got was
all smooth, right?  Remember?

277
00:24:08 --> 00:24:13
So, if we try and figure out what's
happening here,

278
00:24:13 --> 00:24:19
a way of representing this would be
to think what happens if all of the

279
00:24:19 --> 00:24:25
combinations that you could get,
so if we paired them in all possible

280
00:24:25 --> 00:24:31
ways, then every combination would
be identical from that first cross,

281
00:24:31 --> 00:24:37
one from one parent, one from the
other.

282
00:24:37 --> 00:24:41
And, if one was dominant over the
other, it's going to look like this.

283
00:24:41 --> 00:24:46
This is really the word I
introduced you to.

284
00:24:46 --> 00:24:50
That's the genotype.
That's what's going on down at the

285
00:24:50 --> 00:24:55
genetic level.
What you're seeing up here is the

286
00:24:55 --> 00:25:00
observable characteristics
of the organism.

287
00:25:00 --> 00:25:06
That would be the phenotype.
So, then what would happen then

288
00:25:06 --> 00:25:13
with this if he crossed the F1's?
Well, as you recall, they were

289
00:25:13 --> 00:25:20
smooth, but he was now seeing them
as being like this.

290
00:25:20 --> 00:25:27
So that means that the sex cells
that are generated from this,

291
00:25:27 --> 00:25:34
each one will generate one big S,
and one little s.

292
00:25:34 --> 00:25:42
And then, if you put them together
to see how this would work out,

293
00:25:42 --> 00:25:51
well, this one's two big S's.  This
is a big S and a little s,

294
00:25:51 --> 00:26:00
a big S and a little s, and two
little s's.  So,

295
00:26:00 --> 00:26:09
what he's got over here is SS,
SS, and a ratio of 1:2:1.

296
00:26:09 --> 00:26:14
But when you look at the phenotype,
what would we expect?  Well, this

297
00:26:14 --> 00:26:19
would be smooth,
big S and little s.

298
00:26:19 --> 00:26:24
That's smooth.  Big S,
little s, smooth again, and two

299
00:26:24 --> 00:26:31
little s's, that's wrinkled.
There's his ratio of 3:1.

300
00:26:31 --> 00:26:41
Has he proved anything?  It works.
Beautiful.  The model must be right?

301
00:26:41 --> 00:26:50
What do you think?
Are you ready to publish?

302
00:26:50 --> 00:27:00
Why is that?  Why did the model
work?

303
00:27:00 --> 00:27:04
Has the model predicted anything yet?
No, it works because it describes

304
00:27:04 --> 00:27:08
the data.  To some extent,
it's kind of like hitting a curve.

305
00:27:08 --> 00:27:12
You said it, but you don't really
know yet.  Of course it's going to

306
00:27:12 --> 00:27:16
work, because if you got different
data it would've had a different

307
00:27:16 --> 00:27:20
model.  So, you're putting your
finger on a really important point,

308
00:27:20 --> 00:27:24
and that is that you can do an
experiment.  You can get data.

309
00:27:24 --> 00:27:28
It doesn't have to involve DNA
sequencing or fancy technique.

310
00:27:28 --> 00:27:33
You're getting data out of a
biological system.

311
00:27:33 --> 00:27:37
You've come up with a hypothesis
that explains it.

312
00:27:37 --> 00:27:41
But of course it's going to explain
it because you wouldn't publish a

313
00:27:41 --> 00:27:46
model that didn't explain your own
data.  But what he hasn't done is

314
00:27:46 --> 00:27:50
tested it.  Will his model predict
the outcome of something that he

315
00:27:50 --> 00:27:55
hasn't already done?
So, the suggestion was that he

316
00:27:55 --> 00:27:59
should carry out another cross.
And that's what Mendel then did

317
00:27:59 --> 00:28:05
again.
This is what he had to work with.

318
00:28:05 --> 00:28:11
He could cross, and he could count,
and he could do some calculating and

319
00:28:11 --> 00:28:18
some thinking.
But, those were the techniques.

320
00:28:18 --> 00:28:24
I really like thinking about this,
because you can sort of put yourself

321
00:28:24 --> 00:28:31
in his shoes.  So,
what would you guys like to cross?

322
00:28:31 --> 00:28:37
We haven't got much, right?  One,
he did.  One cross he did,

323
00:28:37 --> 00:28:44
the F1 with the homozygous dominant
parent, the pure breeding lines.

324
00:28:44 --> 00:28:51
So, he's got this smooth,
that's a big S and a little s,

325
00:28:51 --> 00:28:58
and he's crossing it with something,
two big S's.  So, the sex cells that

326
00:28:58 --> 00:29:05
you'll get out of this,
so if you set this one up and see

327
00:29:05 --> 00:29:11
what happens, there's the two.
You will get to big S's,

328
00:29:11 --> 00:29:16
big S, little S, the big S,
little S.  This is sort of

329
00:29:16 --> 00:29:22
uninformative.
If you want to look at your notes

330
00:29:22 --> 00:29:27
afterwards, and have this be
consistent, let me just

331
00:29:27 --> 00:29:32
flip this slightly.
I put the two big S's up here,

332
00:29:32 --> 00:29:37
and this is our F1 down here.  That
way I'll be following the same

333
00:29:37 --> 00:29:42
pattern as I did before.
OK, so there we are.  In any case,

334
00:29:42 --> 00:29:47
they're all smooth, but that's not
particularly helpful.

335
00:29:47 --> 00:29:52
He's seen that result before.
It hasn't really proven out.  Given

336
00:29:52 --> 00:29:57
the sort of unexpected result that's
predicted by his model.

337
00:29:57 --> 00:30:03
But he tried another one that's
very, very similar.

338
00:30:03 --> 00:30:15
And in this case,
he crossed the F1 with the

339
00:30:15 --> 00:30:27
homozygous recessive parent.
This is a really important process

340
00:30:27 --> 00:30:35
in genetics.
And the reason,

341
00:30:35 --> 00:30:41
because it's so important,
it's given a special term that's

342
00:30:41 --> 00:30:47
called a test cross.
Let's see what happens with this

343
00:30:47 --> 00:30:53
one, because this one's more
interesting.  So,

344
00:30:53 --> 00:30:59
we take the F1.  So,
this is the F1.  He's now crossing

345
00:30:59 --> 00:31:05
it with this homozygous recessive,
so a parent that's got two particles

346
00:31:05 --> 00:31:11
that are little s.
And so, will the sex cells look like

347
00:31:11 --> 00:31:17
this, a big S little s as before,
to little S's here?  So, if we set

348
00:31:17 --> 00:31:23
up this, as we've done,
there are the sex cells from this F1.

349
00:31:23 --> 00:31:29
Here are the sex cells from the
homozygous, recessive parent.

350
00:31:29 --> 00:31:35
Up here, we get a big S and a
little s for each of those.

351
00:31:35 --> 00:31:40
But here, we get two little s's.
So, if we look at the phenotype,

352
00:31:40 --> 00:31:46
if you're out on the field or out in
the garden sitting in the kitchen,

353
00:31:46 --> 00:31:52
after you brought your seeds in or
wherever he was working,

354
00:31:52 --> 00:31:58
what would you predict you'd see in
a cross like this?

355
00:31:58 --> 00:32:04
These would be both smooth,
but these would both be wrinkled.

356
00:32:04 --> 00:32:09
So, here at the genotypic level,
we've got a ratio, now, of 1:1.  And

357
00:32:09 --> 00:32:15
here as well, there's now a ratio of
1:1.  So, there you have a result

358
00:32:15 --> 00:32:21
that you haven't seen before.
And, if you do that cross and get

359
00:32:21 --> 00:32:27
that result, again,
it doesn't prove your model.

360
00:32:27 --> 00:32:33
Scientific proof is never a QED.

361
00:32:33 --> 00:32:37
Somebody can always come up with an
experiment tomorrow that disproves

362
00:32:37 --> 00:32:42
it.  It tends to work more.
You just keep shoveling on evidence,

363
00:32:42 --> 00:32:47
and finally someone says,
enough, enough, I believe you.

364
00:32:47 --> 00:32:52
So, this was at least a test of the
model, and the model survived this

365
00:32:52 --> 00:32:56
task.  Now, he did one other
experiment.  Of the things that

366
00:32:56 --> 00:33:01
we've got on our plate right now,
is there anything else we might do

367
00:33:01 --> 00:33:08
you can think of?
He did another cross.

368
00:33:08 --> 00:33:16
Pardon?  Two of the heterogeneous
ones, we did the F1's against each

369
00:33:16 --> 00:33:24
other.  That's where we got the 3:1.
We've already crossed the F1's, but

370
00:33:24 --> 00:33:33
I like your idea.  What
if we took the F2's?

371
00:33:33 --> 00:33:37
In this case, it's going to be
pretty complicated because they've

372
00:33:37 --> 00:33:42
got this 2:1:1,
but one of the things you can do

373
00:33:42 --> 00:33:46
with peas is you can self fertilize
them as well as cross them with

374
00:33:46 --> 00:33:51
their neighbors because they've got
the ability to make the eggs.

375
00:33:51 --> 00:33:55
It'll become the seeds, and they
have the pollen,

376
00:33:55 --> 00:34:00
which would be equivalent to the
sperm.  So it got both.

377
00:34:00 --> 00:34:06
So, as long as there's some plants
that you can self fertilize and some

378
00:34:06 --> 00:34:12
you can't, one of the really nice
things about peas,

379
00:34:12 --> 00:34:19
they have the property that you can
self fertilize them.

380
00:34:19 --> 00:34:25
So, another kind of experiment that
Mendel did, then,

381
00:34:25 --> 00:34:32
was to self fertilize another test
of the model, self fertilize the

382
00:34:32 --> 00:34:38
F2's.  Well, the model predicts,
if we look back over there, that

383
00:34:38 --> 00:34:45
what you'll have there is a mix of
things in a ratio of 1:2:1.

384
00:34:45 --> 00:34:49
So, if you were to take seeds from
that F2, and then cross them with

385
00:34:49 --> 00:34:53
themselves, you could figure out all
the different outcomes,

386
00:34:53 --> 00:34:57
and then sum them up.  You'd have a
prediction for what this

387
00:34:57 --> 00:35:02
model would suggest.
All right, so let me just take you

388
00:35:02 --> 00:35:08
through the pieces.
Let's think about a quarter of them,

389
00:35:08 --> 00:35:14
according to the model,
a quarter are that.  So,

390
00:35:14 --> 00:35:19
if we self cross those, what we
should get is all wrinkled because

391
00:35:19 --> 00:35:25
the only thing we're dealing with is
the wrinkled trait.

392
00:35:25 --> 00:35:31
So, that would be a quarter of the
F2 seeds would be expected

393
00:35:31 --> 00:35:39
to give that outcome.
So, three quarters of them are

394
00:35:39 --> 00:35:51
smooth, but it's tricky because
there's two types of them in there,

395
00:35:51 --> 00:36:03
right?  So, of these, one third are
this, and two thirds have that.

396
00:36:03 --> 00:36:09
So, what would happen if we thought
about each of those individually,

397
00:36:09 --> 00:36:15
and thought about the outcome?  Well,
if we take the SS type,

398
00:36:15 --> 00:36:21
and we've self crossed them,
what we're going to get is all

399
00:36:21 --> 00:36:27
smooth because all we've got in the
cross are the traits for the smooth

400
00:36:27 --> 00:36:33
characteristic.
And, if we take these guys and

401
00:36:33 --> 00:36:39
we've self-crossed them, we've
already done that.

402
00:36:39 --> 00:36:46
We know what we will get is we will
get smooth to wrinkled in a ratio of

403
00:36:46 --> 00:36:54
3:1.  So, again,
you could now sit down with that and

404
00:36:54 --> 00:37:01
figure out in total what you would
predict in terms of smooth and

405
00:37:01 --> 00:37:09
wrinkled if you self crossed the F2,
and if the model is correct.

406
00:37:09 --> 00:37:14
So, that was basically [your?
first UROP project, or the end of

407
00:37:14 --> 00:37:20
the first term,
or the first year,

408
00:37:20 --> 00:37:25
or something like that.
And he did publish those results

409
00:37:25 --> 00:37:31
that were published in 1866,
which was the same year as those,

410
00:37:31 --> 00:37:37
about the same time as those results
that Pasteur was publishing that I

411
00:37:37 --> 00:37:43
told you about earlier on.
So, it was a very impressive in

412
00:37:43 --> 00:37:49
retrospect, a truly major
intellectual leap.

413
00:37:49 --> 00:37:56
But, it had almost no impact at all
on the world.  And there's a theme

414
00:37:56 --> 00:38:03
here that it sort of tried to hit up
several times.

415
00:38:03 --> 00:38:06
And we saw it,
to some extent,

416
00:38:06 --> 00:38:10
with the early work on DNA,
that someone can get evidence for an

417
00:38:10 --> 00:38:14
idea.  But if the scientific
community is ready to accept it,

418
00:38:14 --> 00:38:18
it can take quite awhile before that
idea becomes credible even if it's

419
00:38:18 --> 00:38:22
correct.  The data was there.
The DNA was genetic material quite

420
00:38:22 --> 00:38:26
a bit before the general scientists
thought it was,

421
00:38:26 --> 00:38:30
and it just seemed like it was too
simple a molecule,

422
00:38:30 --> 00:38:34
too boring a molecule to be possibly
able to encode anything.

423
00:38:34 --> 00:38:38
And the same sort of thing happened
here.  It was some geneticists

424
00:38:38 --> 00:38:41
picked up on this but not
until about 1900.
