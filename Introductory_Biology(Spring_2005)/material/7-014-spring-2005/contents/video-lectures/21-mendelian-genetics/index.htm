<p></p>
<p>So, we have another kind of very interesting piece of the course  right now. We're going to continue to talk about genetics, except now  we're going to talk about the genetics of diploid organisms, which apart  from bacteria, most of the organisms including us are diploid. They  have more than one copy of each chromosome, and so we'll go through a  segment on this, and also talk about mitosis and meiosis, the central  processes of cell division and the segregation of genetic material that  underlie life as we know it.</p>
<p>And then, were going to charge into a  session of recombinant DNA, and some of these technologies, PCR and  various things that you see in the newspapers all the time. And then,  I'll finish up with the session on the immune system, which a few of you  thought was surprising that bacteria recombine. I'll tell you in that  system it will feel like science fiction relative to what I've told you  up to now.</p>
<p>It's an absolutely amazing system. So, we are going to  start today with genetics of diploid organisms. So I'm going to go back  to how this was first understood. And most of you have probably heard of  Gregor Mendel, who discovered this, and surely some fraction of you  have run into an exposure to this topic before. But in keeping with what  I'm trying to do in this course, could you guys watch out there? I  think I'm just going to unplug, yeah, it's OK.</p>
<p>I think I'm just  going to unplug it for just a minute here. You've probably heard of  Mendel. Some of you have seen these different squares. You might have  memorized it from a textbook or something like that. I'm going to try  and see if we can go through this material up another level of  sophistication because, again, and I'm saying, science didn't just come  down from on high and end up with facts in a textbook.</p>
<p>What's in a  textbook is somebody's effort to take a current state of understanding  which is based on experimentation and come up with models. And what  you're seeing in the textbooks are the models such as they were as of  the time the textbook was submitted for publication. Sometimes they  change even before the textbooks get out. But anyway, it's a process.</p>
<p>Mendel  was one of the starting people who started this process, really a key  figure, and a guy with an amazing intellect. But before we start in, I  just want to show you a couple of pictures because these kind of knocked  me over when I saw them. I don't know what kind of image you have of  Mendel. You probably know he was a monk, and he did something with peas,  and he figured out this stuff about genetics.</p>
<p>And most people  probably carry around an image probably somewhat like this sort of  romanticized drawing. He was a monk all right, but it was at an  Augustine monastery in Bruno in Austria that was a very major  intellectual center. They even published a scientific journal. They sent  Mendel off to Vienna to go to university. While he was there, he  studied physics, math, as well as botany.</p>
<p>So he had, in many ways,  a background that is very similar to you guys, very heavy on the  quantitative physical science, mathematical sort of background. And then  he went on to do some experiments in biology. And I think you maybe can  get a sense of this. You can see a picture of what Mendel actually  looked like. Here's one picture of him. But the one that really blew me  away, I have a picture of the monks.</p>
<p>Just think of what ever image  you had of the monks that Mendel was at. Well there's a picture of  them. To me, they look nothing so much like a group of university  presidents or something sitting around for a portrait. And he traveled  very widely. Here he was on his way to London here. Here is a picture of  him with a group of people on his way to, I think he was in Paris on  his way to London.</p>
<p>So this wasn't a little isolated monk in a  garden who stumbled across stuff. He was a rather sophisticated guy  going after some interesting problems. And this was the garden in which  he did his experiments. Here's a picture of it. So this was a  straightforward experimental setup for these really amazing things he  did. So, with that kind of background, Mendel was interested in a  problem of inheritance.</p>
<p>And people have been aware that traits  were inherited. That was the whole principle of domesticating animals  and domesticating crops, that if you took parents with certain  characteristics and crossed them together, the offspring then had the  traits that were associated with the parents. And so people were able to  get better domesticated animals or better domesticated crops. But up  until then, this mixing was thought of sort of like blending liquids,  stir together some green and red, and a little this and that.</p>
<p>And  it all stirred together. And as you'll see, what one of Mendel's great  insights was, was that it wasn't like mixing liquids. And to study this  problem, then, he picked a system. It wasn't that he was just fiddling  around with peas. He was a pretty sophisticated guy, and he picked peas  as an experimental organisms for three reasons. And so, why peas? Well  one, they were easy to grow, and that's still a major consideration of  any model system that you want to use and science today.</p>
<p>It's  really tricky to grow, it's very hard to work with. It was easy to  pollinate in a controlled way. Just the structure of the pea flower  makes it very easy to make sure to either put the pollen right on the  pistol of that same flower, which is a kind of self fertilization, or to  make sure that the pollen goes from one flower to another, which is  basically cross-pollination. And the third thing, and this was a really  important thing, was the system was worked on before.</p>
<p>And there  were a number of what were called pure-breeding lines. If he had just  grabbed peas out of the wild it would be sort of like me starting to do  genetics by crossing a couple of you guys. We'd get offspring, all  right, and we'd cross those offspring, we'd keep getting things, people  that look different and different, maybe something like the parents, but  what had happened with peas is people had taken a pea, and then they  continually inbred it until it finally sort of settled down.</p>
<p>It  always had white flowers. It always had wrinkled seeds. It always had  whatever the particular trait was. And so, I think I showed you this  slide earlier. This shows two things. You can see there are smooth seeds  and then wrinkled seeds. And it may be a little hard to tell in this  light, but there is sort of two colors here. One's kind of greenish and  one's sort of yellowish.</p>
<p>So there, you see two of the traits right  there. There were also flower colors, and height, and other things that  had the characteristic. They were pure breeding. Every time you took  that line and if you self crossed it and put out its progeny, you'd see  the same characteristic each time. So, this was the system that Mendel  started to study this problem of inheritance.</p>
<p>And how does  blending come together when two organisms brought pollen? Or, if it was  other animals like us, it would be sperm and egg. But somehow, you did  something that ended up giving you an egg that got fertilized. And out  of that came the progeny. So, what Mendel did, the term that's used,  they say he carried out a cross. This is genetic-speak here now. So he  took pollen from one plant.</p>
<p>And used it to fertilize another  plant, collected the seeds that came out of this, and he examined the  progeny. And I think an interesting way of thinking about this is a UROP  project. You'd come into Mendel's lab and wanted to do a UROP project,  it was pretty easy. I could probably show you all the techniques you  needed to know, and this is it. I'd show how you pollinate, collect  seeds, and then we'd look at the characteristics.</p>
<p>So, it's just  some fairly simple manipulations and some observational stuff. So, let's  suppose you're doing Mendel's thing as a UROP project, and let's just  see where that will take us. So, what Mendel did to begin with, he took  one of these pure breeding lines that was smooth or I'll abbreviated as a  capital S. And he pollinated it with something that was wrinkled.</p>
<p>I'll  do that as little S. And then he collected the seeds from what's known  as the first generation, starting with something like this. And  geneticists use the term F1 for this first generation in a cross like  this, and what he found was everything, all the seeds, were smooth. So,  the wrinkled trait had, if you will, disappeared. That's your first UROP  experiment. Time to submit to nature, or science, or something, and  write a little paper like Watson and Crick that turns the world on its  end.</p>
<p>What would you do next? No gels, no Whitehead Sequencing  Facility. Anybody got any ideas? I've showed you all the techniques that  he knew about. Pardon? Cross it again? What's your thinking? Do you  think the traits disappear, or do you think it's hiding? It might be  hiding, right? I don't know what he thought, but I think that's a  reasonable to think about it is he's probably trying to figure out, did  this wrinkled trait just disappear from the face of the Earth, or is it  hiding in those first-generation seeds? So, let's put that up here.</p>
<p>So,  that's exactly what he did. So, he took these seeds, now, that were the  smooth F1. These are not the same smooth as the parental up here. Just  to make clear, you guys understand these are pure breeding. These are  the ones that people have been breeding for a long time, this one and  this one. In this case, even though I'm drawing it in circles, this is a  smooth F1, smooth F1.</p>
<p>And, this time when he did the experiment  he looked at the second generation, or the F2 generation as a geneticist  would call it. What he found, he got some smooth and he got some  wrinkled. So, the wrinkled trait reemerged in the F2. So it wasn't  really gone. It was hiding. OK, time to submit to Nature, Science or  Cell. Got it? He didn't try and publish it at that point.</p>
<p>He did  something else. He had the same kind of background you guys have. Can  you think what he might have done? He could cross again. There's  something else he did with this experiment, though. Well, you're  thinking of new experiments. He's got a little data processing he can do  here. What did you say? I'm not able to hear, sorry. Statistics, OK.  I'll simplify it even slightly before that.</p>
<p>I've got some of each.  Count them, right, exactly. So that's what he did, and I think the  numbers were, if I remember 5474 and 1850. So, what should I do now?  Ratio? Absolutely. We could count another million of them, but that  probably would not be terribly productive. And what he found out is that  when he did that, he found that he got a ratio that was pretty close to  3:1. And, so that was sort of what he found out from this by doing this  sort of thing over again was a pattern.</p>
<p>A trait disappeared in  the F1. The trait reemerged in the F2, and the two traits had this. The  ratio of the two traits would be about 3:1. If you don't think this is  sort of like a UROP project or something, that's a page out of some of  Mendel's actual notes while he was doing his crosses. And what he did  next, then, was to take some other traits. Yeah? Sorry? Excuse me?  Reemerged in F2.</p>
<p>So, he took some other traits, white and purple  flowers, tall, short, I found that there were at least certain other  traits. It didn't work for everything he studied, but some of them he  could see the same pattern. One of the traits disappeared. It reemerged  in the F2, and when he counted them, he'd find that the trait that  reemerged was at one, and the other one there were three times as many.</p>
<p>So,  he'd seen a pattern. And all he's done at this point is to cross  flowers and count the progeny. So, at that point Mendel tried to explain  his data. So, he had to, now, take the next part of the scientific  process. And what's kind of nice about thinking about Mendel, in this  sense, is we are not overwhelmed by complicated techniques. You can see,  I think, the scientific process. And it's a very bare bones thing  marching along.</p>
<p>So now he's got some data. He's quantitated his  stuff. He's found it reproducible. It's not only for seeds. It seems to  be some general feature. And the thing about this, I guess, I don't know  what he thought but it seems to be likely that he could see that this  didn't fit very well with the blending idea. Like, you'd pour together  two liquids, and you'd stir them all up. Instead, he really made this  monumental leap in thinking that genetic information must come in some  sort of particular form, come in particles, or units, or quanta if you  want to think about if it if you're a physicist.</p>
<p>We know those  units as genes right now. We grow up with it right now, but to go from  the idea that genetic information was kind of like two liquids blending  to the idea it was a little particle, so it was just about the same kind  of leap as thinking that energy comes in particles instead of a  continuous sort of thing. So, that was the kind of insight that Mendel  had. And so genetic info comes in particles, units.</p>
<p>I was going to  say, we now call these genes, and if that was what it was then he  started to think about these traits as particles that had a different  character associated with each of them. That would mean there would be  one particle that was a big S, and that was smooth. There was some other  particle that was specified. The wrinkled character, that would be  called a small s. So, what was happening in these crosses, then, he was  now mixing particles instead of liquids.</p>
<p>Again, I don't know how  he got to, how many particles there had to be of each per organism. It  could have been anywhere from two upwards. He had to have two in order  to explain the sort of stuff he was working with. There's no reason he  couldn't have thought of 12 or something. But I assume you start with  the very simplest thing, number that you can think of, and see if you  can make this work.</p>
<p>So, what he hypothesized, then, was that each  organism had two copies of each of these particles. So, two copies of  each particle, so this would mean that there were two types of  particles. So, there would be the S and the smooth. So, he can get three  types of things. He could get one that was both big S or smooth. Or you  could have the ones that were the two little S's. And these would be  wrinkled. Or, if you had the other combination, what he figured out,  what fit with this model is these would have to be smooth.</p>
<p>That  would have to mean that one of them is dominant over the other when you  put them in combination. So, in this thing, the big S would be said to  be dominant. And the little s Would be said to be recessive. There's  another little term here that I'm going to introduce because it'll help  us talk about this stuff over the next few days, terms geneticists use  all the time.</p>
<p>Because these both have two of the same, they're  said to be homozygous, do the same. And this one, with one of each, is  said to be heterozygous. OK, so there is, I think, sort of the setup for  Mendel's model. He had to contend with one other issue, though, and  that was if every organism has two, and two parents get together and  each donate something, unless you did something, the offspring would  have four.</p>
<p>When those offspring got together, the next one would  have twice as many, and so on. So, from probably, I don't know whether  it was just from first principles, but I would imagine he figured out  that if organisms had sex with pollen and whatever, or egg and sperm,  that something had to be done to get around this problem of an ever  increasing number of particles.</p>
<p>So, he envisioned that when there  were specialized cells for sex, and that they have the number so that  the sex cells would have half the number of particles so that when each  parent donated one, you'd be back up to two. It's pretty simple,  straightforward thinking once you've gotten the idea that these things  are coming in a particular form. So, with this, could he now explain his  results? Let's do it over here.</p>
<p>So, what happened in the first  cross? He had a smooth, pure breeding line crossed with, so the sex  cells from this, each one would have been a big S, and the sex cells  from each one of this would have been a little s. And as you recall,  what he got was all smooth, right? Remember? So, if we try and figure  out what's happening here, a way of representing this would be to think  what happens if all of the combinations that you could get, so if we  paired them in all possible ways, then every combination would be  identical from that first cross, one from one parent, one from the  other.</p>
<p>And, if one was dominant over the other, it's going to look  like this. This is really the word I introduced you to. That's the  genotype. That's what's going on down at the genetic level. What you're  seeing up here is the observable characteristics of the organism. That  would be the phenotype. So, then what would happen then with this if he  crossed the F1's? Well, as you recall, they were smooth, but he was now  seeing them as being like this.</p>
<p>So that means that the sex cells  that are generated from this, each one will generate one big S, and one  little s. And then, if you put them together to see how this would work  out, well, this one's two big S's. This is a big S and a little s, a big  S and a little s, and two little s's. So, what he's got over here is  SS, Ss, and ss in a ratio of 1:2:1. But when you look at the phenotype,  what would we expect? Well, this would be smooth, big S and little s.</p>
<p>That's  smooth. Big S, little s, smooth again, and two little s's, that's  wrinkled. There's his ratio of 3:1. Has he proved anything? It works.  Beautiful. The model must be right? What do you think? Are you ready to  publish? Why is that? Why did the model work? Has the model predicted  anything yet? No, it works because it describes the data. To some  extent, it's kind of like hitting a curve.</p>
<p>You said it, but you  don't really know yet. Of course it's going to work, because if you got  different data it would've had a different model. So, you're putting  your finger on a really important point, and that is that you can do an  experiment. You can get data. It doesn't have to involve DNA sequencing  or fancy techniques. You're getting data out of a biological system.</p>
<p>You've  come up with a hypothesis that explains it. But of course it's going to  explain it because you wouldn't publish a model that didn't explain  your own data. But what he hasn't done is tested it. Will his model  predict the outcome of something that he hasn't already done? So, the  suggestion was that he should carry out another cross. And that's what  Mendel then did again.</p>
<p>This is what he had to work with. He could  cross, and he could count, and he could do some calculating and some  thinking. But, those were the techniques. I really like thinking about  this, because you can sort of put yourself in his shoes. So, what would  you guys like to cross? We haven't got much, right? One, he did. One  cross he did, the F1 with the homozygous dominant parent, the pure  breeding lines.</p>
<p>So, he's got this smooth, that's a big S and a  little s, and he's crossing it with something, two big S's. So, the sex  cells that you'll get out of this, so if you set this one up and see  what happens, there's the two. You will get to big S's, big S, little S,  the big S, little S. This is sort of uninformative. If you want to look  at your notes afterwards, and have this be consistent, let me just flip  this slightly.</p>
<p>I put the two big S's up here, and this is our F1  down here. That way I'll be following the same pattern as I did before.  OK, so there we are. In any case, they're all smooth, but that's not  particularly helpful. He's seen that result before. It hasn't really  proven out. Given the sort of unexpected result that's predicted by his  model. But he tried another one that's very, very similar.</p>
<p>And in  this case, he crossed the F1 with the homozygous recessive parent. This  is a really important process in genetics. And the reason, because it's  so important, it's given a special term that's called a test cross.  Let's see what happens with this one, because this one's more  interesting. So, we take the F1. So, this is the F1. He's now crossing  it with this homozygous recessive, so a parent that's got two particles  that are little s.</p>
<p>And so, will the sex cells look like this: a  big S little s as before, two little S's here? So, if we set up this, as  we've done, there are the sex cells from this F1. Here are the sex  cells from the homozygous, recessive parent. Up here, we get a big S and  a little s for each of those. But here, we get two little s's. So, if  we look at the phenotype, if you're out on the field or out in the  garden sitting in the kitchen, after you brought your seeds in or  wherever he was working, what would you predict you'd see in a cross  like this? These would be both smooth, but these would both be wrinkled.</p>
<p>So,  here at the genotypic level, we've got a ratio, now, of 1:1. And here  as well, there's now a ratio of 1:1. So, there you have a result that  you haven't seen before. And, if you do that cross and get that result,  again, it doesn't prove your model. Scientific proof is never a QED.  Somebody can always come up with an experiment tomorrow that disproves  it. It tends to work more. You just keep shoveling on evidence, and  finally someone says, enough, enough, I believe you.</p>
<p>So, this was  at least a test of the model, and the model survived this task. Now, he  did one other experiment. Of the things that we've got on our plate  right now, is there anything else we might do you can think of? He did  another cross. Pardon? Two of the heterogeneous ones? We did the F1's  against each other. That's where we got the 3:1. We've already crossed  the F1's, but I like your idea.</p>
<p>What if we took the F2's? In this  case, it's going to be pretty complicated because they've got this  2:1:1, but one of the things you can do with peas is you can self  fertilize them as well as cross them with their neighbors because  they've got the ability to make the eggs. It'll become the seeds, and  they have the pollen, which would be equivalent to the sperm. So it got  both. So, as long as there's some plants that you can self fertilize and  some you can't, one of the really nice things about peas, they have the  property that you can self fertilize them.</p>
<p>So, another kind of  experiment that Mendel did, then, was to self fertilize another test of  the model, self fertilize the F2's. Well, the model predicts, if we look  back over there, that what you'll have there is a mix of things in a  ratio of 1:2:1. So, if you were to take seeds from that F2, and then  cross them with themselves, you could figure out all the different  outcomes, and then sum them up.</p>
<p>You'd have a prediction for what  this model would suggest. All right, so let me just take you through the  pieces. Let's think about a quarter of them, according to the model, a  quarter are that. So, if we self cross those, what we should get is all  wrinkled because the only thing we're dealing with is the wrinkled  trait. So, that would be a quarter of the F2 seeds would be expected to  give that outcome.</p>
<p>So, three quarters of them are smooth, but it's  tricky because there's two types of them in there, right? So, of these,  one third are this, and two thirds have that. So, what would happen if  we thought about each of those individually, and thought about the  outcome? Well, if we take the SS type, and we've self crossed them, what  we're going to get is all smooth because all we've got in the cross are  the traits for the smooth characteristic.</p>
<p>And, if we take these  guys and we've self-crossed them, we've already done that. We know what  we will get is we will get smooth to wrinkled in a ratio of 3:1. So,  again, you could now sit down with that and figure out in total what you  would predict in terms of smooth and wrinkled if you self crossed the  F2, and if the model is correct. So, that was basically your first UROP  project, or the end of the first term, or the first year, or something  like that.</p>
<p>And he did publish those results that were published in  1866, which was the same year as those, about the same time as those  results that Pasteur was publishing that I told you about earlier on.  So, it was a very impressive in retrospect, a truly major intellectual  leap. But, it had almost no impact at all on the world. And there's a  theme here that it sort of tried to hit up several times.</p>
<p>And we  saw it, to some extent, with the early work on DNA, that someone can get  evidence for an idea. But if the scientific community is ready to  accept it, it can take quite awhile before that idea becomes credible  even if it's correct. The data was there. The DNA was genetic material  quite a bit before the general scientists thought it was, and it just  seemed like it was too simple a molecule, too boring a molecule to be  possibly able to encode anything.</p>
<p>And the same sort of thing happened here. It was some geneticists picked up on this but not until about 1900.</p>
