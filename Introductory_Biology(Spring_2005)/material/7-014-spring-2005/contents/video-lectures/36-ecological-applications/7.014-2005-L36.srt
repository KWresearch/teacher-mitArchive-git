1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
And I just wanted to mention a few
more things about community ecology

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:09
before I move onto the final lecture
which I've forecasted to you where

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:14
I'm going to try to tie everything
together through a research story

4
00:00:14 --> 00:00:18
that I want to tell you about.
But before we go to that, I just

5
00:00:18 --> 00:00:23
want to present one very famous
ecological experiment

6
00:00:23 --> 00:00:28
from your textbook.
Because what we're trying to do here

7
00:00:28 --> 00:00:32
in this lecture is bring together
the first set of lectures where we

8
00:00:32 --> 00:00:37
talked about biogeochemical cycles
and productivity which we think of

9
00:00:37 --> 00:00:41
as the function of ecosystems with
the last set of lectures where we

10
00:00:41 --> 00:00:46
talked about population biology,
community structure where we

11
00:00:46 --> 00:00:51
actually talk about different
species and how they interact.

12
00:00:51 --> 00:00:55
And the structure of the community
effects productivity

13
00:00:55 --> 00:01:00
in biogeochemistry.
And these processes in turn feed

14
00:01:00 --> 00:01:04
back and affect the structure of the
community.  And this is something

15
00:01:04 --> 00:01:08
ecologists have known,
but it's not easy to demonstrate

16
00:01:08 --> 00:01:12
this experimentally.
So one of the famous experiments

17
00:01:12 --> 00:01:16
was done by David Tillman of the
University of Minnesota because

18
00:01:16 --> 00:01:20
these are very long-term experiments.
And, of course,

19
00:01:20 --> 00:01:24
it's easier to do these kinds of
experiments with plants because they

20
00:01:24 --> 00:01:29
actually stay put.
So he asked the question is the

21
00:01:29 --> 00:01:35
species diversity of plants in a
living community related to the

22
00:01:35 --> 00:01:41
productivity of that community,
and also the resistance and the

23
00:01:41 --> 00:01:48
resilience of that community to
stress?  So what he did is he set up

24
00:01:48 --> 00:01:54
plots.  And he went through
generations of graduate students

25
00:01:54 --> 00:02:00
monitoring these over many years.
This would be a plot that would

26
00:02:00 --> 00:02:06
have a single species in the plot.
And here's a plot that has 24

27
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
different species in the plot.
If we mixed them together they were

28
00:02:10 --> 00:02:15
all indigenous species that would
grow there.  And he showed first

29
00:02:15 --> 00:02:19
that the total plant cover here as a
percent was a function of the number

30
00:02:19 --> 00:02:24
of species per plot.
So establishing that indeed

31
00:02:24 --> 00:02:28
productivity, the amount of plant
biomass produced was a function of

32
00:02:28 --> 00:02:33
species diversity.
And when you think about this it

33
00:02:33 --> 00:02:39
makes sense because the more diverse
species you have the more likely

34
00:02:39 --> 00:02:45
they're able to exploit the full
suite of resources in the soil and

35
00:02:45 --> 00:02:50
are probably more resistant to
predation.  So the more diverse the

36
00:02:50 --> 00:02:56
plot it has a greater biomass.
The next thing he looked at, and

37
00:02:56 --> 00:03:02
this is in your textbook,
was the effect of the biomass to the

38
00:03:02 --> 00:03:08
resistance to disturbance.
So this is a change in biomass one

39
00:03:08 --> 00:03:14
year before a drought and then to
the peak of the drought showing that

40
00:03:14 --> 00:03:20
this ratio increased with the number
of species.  And finally the

41
00:03:20 --> 00:03:26
resilience, that is how long it
takes for the community to recover

42
00:03:26 --> 00:03:32
after it's been stressed,
he was also able to show increase as

43
00:03:32 --> 00:03:37
the number of species increased.
So there is a relationship between

44
00:03:37 --> 00:03:43
community structure,
and indeed productivity,

45
00:03:43 --> 00:03:48
resistance and resilience increase
if there is more diversity,

46
00:03:48 --> 00:03:54
which is, of course, one of the
motivators for preserving species

47
00:03:54 --> 00:04:00
diversity on the planet
globally.  OK.

48
00:04:00 --> 00:04:05
Now we're going to try to tie all
this together through this story.

49
00:04:05 --> 00:04:10
Now, going back, many of the slides
that I'm going to show you you've

50
00:04:10 --> 00:04:15
already seen.  Parts of this story
you've already learned from my

51
00:04:15 --> 00:04:21
previous lectures,
so I'm trying to tie this together

52
00:04:21 --> 00:04:26
and remind what you know and help
you to think about how you can apply

53
00:04:26 --> 00:04:32
what you know to current issues in
global ecology.

54
00:04:32 --> 00:04:39
So you remember this,
our global carbon cycle showing the

55
00:04:39 --> 00:04:46
photosynthesis of the plants
balanced by the respiration of the

56
00:04:46 --> 00:04:53
plants and the animals.
You learned this.  And superimposed

57
00:04:53 --> 00:05:00
on that is our burning of fossil
fuels and land use changes,

58
00:05:00 --> 00:05:08
i.e., cutting down trees increasing
CO2 in the atmosphere.

59
00:05:08 --> 00:05:13
And as we showed last time,
I mean in the first set of lectures

60
00:05:13 --> 00:05:19
that this sudden excavation of this
fossil photosynthate is causing a

61
00:05:19 --> 00:05:24
dramatic increase in CO2 in the
atmosphere relative to historical

62
00:05:24 --> 00:05:30
concentrations of CO2.
This is thousands of years before

63
00:05:30 --> 00:05:35
present.
And we're worried about that.

64
00:05:35 --> 00:05:39
This is all reminding you, getting
you in the train of thought here.

65
00:05:39 --> 00:05:44
We're worried about that because
there's good evidence that these

66
00:05:44 --> 00:05:48
increases in CO2 are already
increasing the temperature of the

67
00:05:48 --> 00:05:53
planet.  This is average temperature
over the last thousand years.

68
00:05:53 --> 00:05:57
And if it isn't already there is
certainty that it will in

69
00:05:57 --> 00:06:02
the very near future.
So let's look here in the ocean,

70
00:06:02 --> 00:06:07
my favorite ecosystem, where the
phytoplankton,

71
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
that you know all about now,
play a critical role in drawing CO2

72
00:06:11 --> 00:06:16
out of the atmosphere.
And this draw down is referred to

73
00:06:16 --> 00:06:21
as the “biological pump” of the
oceans.  And we talked about this

74
00:06:21 --> 00:06:26
very briefly.  Here's the
phytoplankton community

75
00:06:26 --> 00:06:31
photosynthesizing,
drawing CO2 into the surface ocean.

76
00:06:31 --> 00:06:36
And then because of the food web,
that you've learned all about, most

77
00:06:36 --> 00:06:41
of this phytoplankton productivity
is eaten by zooplankton and by fish

78
00:06:41 --> 00:06:46
going through the marine food web.
As it's eaten they are respiring

79
00:06:46 --> 00:06:52
and CO2 is released and it goes
right out of the system.

80
00:06:52 --> 00:06:57
So CO2 in, CO2 out.  But some of
that carbon, some of that

81
00:06:57 --> 00:07:02
photosynthetic product finds its way
to the deep ocean through fecal

82
00:07:02 --> 00:07:07
pellets of zooplankton,
through aggregates of dead cells,

83
00:07:07 --> 00:07:13
through just basic mucus that fluffs
off of jellyfish.

84
00:07:13 --> 00:07:16
It's all carbon that came from
photosynthesis,

85
00:07:16 --> 00:07:19
but some of it settles down to the
deep ocean where it's chewed upon.

86
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
Now, here is where all those deep
consumers that I showed you in the

87
00:07:23 --> 00:07:28
DVDs last time are.
There are fish and squid and

88
00:07:28 --> 00:07:34
jellyfish in the deep oceans that
feed on this carbon that rains down,

89
00:07:34 --> 00:07:40
because there is no photosynthesis
down there, and bacteria that then

90
00:07:40 --> 00:07:46
regenerates that organic carbon into
CO2.  So this functions as a pump.

91
00:07:46 --> 00:07:52
And the concentration of carbon
dioxide in the deep ocean is very

92
00:07:52 --> 00:07:59
high if you look at a depth
profile of CO2.

93
00:07:59 --> 00:08:03
This is depth and this is CO2.
And at the surface, of course,

94
00:08:03 --> 00:08:08
it's in equilibrium with the
atmosphere.  And it's very high in

95
00:08:08 --> 00:08:13
the deep ocean because at low
temperatures and pressures it can

96
00:08:13 --> 00:08:18
hold.  So this is a huge reservoir
of CO2, so much that if you did a

97
00:08:18 --> 00:08:23
thought experiment and you killed
all the life in the oceans and just

98
00:08:23 --> 00:08:28
shut off this biological pump and
then you let the oceans mix all the

99
00:08:28 --> 00:08:33
way to the bottom,
which they won't do,

100
00:08:33 --> 00:08:38
but this is just a thought
experiment.

101
00:08:38 --> 00:08:42
And you let that all equilibrate
with the atmosphere,

102
00:08:42 --> 00:08:47
all of that CO2, the concentration
in the atmosphere would double to

103
00:08:47 --> 00:08:51
triple what it is today.
That's how much CO2 is in the deep

104
00:08:51 --> 00:08:56
ocean.  And so this is a natural
function of the ocean ecosystem,

105
00:08:56 --> 00:09:01
is to maintain this pump and
maintain this gradient of CO2.

106
00:09:01 --> 00:09:05
So this you also learned,
remember?  That the oceans are not

107
00:09:05 --> 00:09:10
this homogeneous soup of
phytoplankton,

108
00:09:10 --> 00:09:15
but there are areas of very high
phytoplankton biomass and

109
00:09:15 --> 00:09:20
productivity and low biomass and
medium in the green here.

110
00:09:20 --> 00:09:25
And we talked about nutrient
limitation of that primary

111
00:09:25 --> 00:09:30
production, which is the
availability of nutrients.

112
00:09:30 --> 00:09:34
And what I told you was that the
sort of standard understanding of

113
00:09:34 --> 00:09:39
this system was that nitrogen and
phosphorus were the primary limiting

114
00:09:39 --> 00:09:43
nutrients, this is all review for
your final exam,

115
00:09:43 --> 00:09:48
in aquatic ecosystems.
But I told you that I was going to

116
00:09:48 --> 00:09:52
tell you in the last lecture that
there was more to it than that.

117
00:09:52 --> 00:09:57
And there is indeed much more to it
than that.

118
00:09:57 --> 00:10:01
So for years we thought that
nitrogen and phosphorus were the

119
00:10:01 --> 00:10:06
nutrients that were regulating this
differential productivity,

120
00:10:06 --> 00:10:10
but we knew that something was wrong
with our understanding.

121
00:10:10 --> 00:10:15
Because these satellite images,
which I just showed you, of the

122
00:10:15 --> 00:10:19
distribution of productivity showed
this distribution.

123
00:10:19 --> 00:10:24
But if you took a simulation model
and modeled the global productivity

124
00:10:24 --> 00:10:28
based on the availability of
nitrogen and phosphorus to the

125
00:10:28 --> 00:10:33
phytoplankton this is what
the model showed.

126
00:10:33 --> 00:10:37
They said this is what the ocean
should look like,

127
00:10:37 --> 00:10:41
not that.  There should be much more
productivity here in the equator and

128
00:10:41 --> 00:10:45
down here in the Southern Ocean than
there actually is.

129
00:10:45 --> 00:10:49
And, in fact, people wrote papers
why isn't the equator greener?

130
00:10:49 --> 00:10:53
And they had all these different
hypothesis for why that might be,

131
00:10:53 --> 00:10:57
a lot of them having to do with
grazing with the food web.

132
00:10:57 --> 00:11:02
Well, it turns out that iron is a
really important limiting factor in

133
00:11:02 --> 00:11:08
the ocean.  And this is a story that
has just unfolded in the last 15

134
00:11:08 --> 00:11:13
years.  And I'm not telling you in
exactly the order that it unfolded,

135
00:11:13 --> 00:11:19
but more or less in the order that
it unfolded.  A fellow named John

136
00:11:19 --> 00:11:25
Martin who is an oceanographer out
at Moss Landing Marine Labs had been

137
00:11:25 --> 00:11:31
studying iron for quite a
long time in the ocean.

138
00:11:31 --> 00:11:35
And he had a hypothesis that iron
was limiting.  But most people

139
00:11:35 --> 00:11:39
wouldn't believe him because most
people, when they went out to

140
00:11:39 --> 00:11:44
measure iron in the oceans,
got very high concentrations.

141
00:11:44 --> 00:11:48
So they said how could that be
limiting?  Well,

142
00:11:48 --> 00:11:53
it turned out that most people were
measuring contamination in their

143
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57
iron samples.  And if any of you
have ever been on a marine ship,

144
00:11:57 --> 00:12:02
if you look around the deck you
notice there is always rust.

145
00:12:02 --> 00:12:06
They are constantly painting marine
ships, right, because the seawater

146
00:12:06 --> 00:12:11
is very corrosive.
And so there is rust everywhere.

147
00:12:11 --> 00:12:16
And it turns out that you have to
be heroically clean in order to

148
00:12:16 --> 00:12:21
measure the concentration of iron in
seawater.  And John Martin and his

149
00:12:21 --> 00:12:26
group realized this and went out and
developed these techniques to

150
00:12:26 --> 00:12:31
collect the sample and to have it
never see air before it went into

151
00:12:31 --> 00:12:36
the sample bottle.
And they acid washed the sample

152
00:12:36 --> 00:12:40
bottles through this process which
takes weeks and weeks and weeks.

153
00:12:40 --> 00:12:44
I mean you had to really believe
that iron was limiting in order to

154
00:12:44 --> 00:12:48
go through all this agony to measure
the level.  So his group was able to

155
00:12:48 --> 00:12:52
measure really low levels of iron in
seawater, but still they weren't

156
00:12:52 --> 00:12:56
able to convince people because this
was such a totally different way of

157
00:12:56 --> 00:13:00
thinking about the oceans.
So there was a lot of pushback.

158
00:13:00 --> 00:13:04
He also argued that iron is
introduced to the oceans through

159
00:13:04 --> 00:13:09
atmospheric dust.
Those people did believe.

160
00:13:09 --> 00:13:13
And that if you looked at the
atmospheric dust flux,

161
00:13:13 --> 00:13:18
which is proportional to the iron
flux, you'd see that in the Atlantic

162
00:13:18 --> 00:13:23
it is relatively high because you
have wind patterns coming off these

163
00:13:23 --> 00:13:27
deserts in Africa.
And also over here in the Western

164
00:13:27 --> 00:13:32
Pacific it's relatively high.
It's low down here around the

165
00:13:32 --> 00:13:37
Antarctic because there's no land
source there.  So these patterns of

166
00:13:37 --> 00:13:43
dust delivery map on pretty well to
this discrepancy to what we see and

167
00:13:43 --> 00:13:48
what we model if nitrogen was the
limiting nutrient.

168
00:13:48 --> 00:13:53
So what John Martin argued was that
there was lots of nitrogen and

169
00:13:53 --> 00:13:58
phosphorus in these regions but
there's not enough iron for the

170
00:13:58 --> 00:14:04
phytoplanktons to actually
utilize that.

171
00:14:04 --> 00:14:08
Remember the Redfield ratio we
talked about, how it's the

172
00:14:08 --> 00:14:13
availability of nutrients relative
to what's required by the plant that

173
00:14:13 --> 00:14:18
determines what's limiting?
So he did some experiments where he

174
00:14:18 --> 00:14:23
went out in the boat and took
samples.  In the control sample he

175
00:14:23 --> 00:14:28
would add nothing and another sample
he would phosphorus and nitrogen and

176
00:14:28 --> 00:14:33
another sample would add iron.
And he was able to show that the

177
00:14:33 --> 00:14:37
addition of iron caused
phytoplankton to bloom.

178
00:14:37 --> 00:14:41
He said iron is limiting in these
regions of the ocean,

179
00:14:41 --> 00:14:46
but everybody said bah,
bah, bah, no it's not, we don't

180
00:14:46 --> 00:14:50
believe you.  They made up reasons
why these experiments couldn't be

181
00:14:50 --> 00:14:54
true.  There are not zooplankton in
the bottle so this and that and the

182
00:14:54 --> 00:14:59
other thing.  And so he persevered.
And he said OK.

183
00:14:59 --> 00:15:04
If you don't believe my bottle
experiment, I'm going to go out and

184
00:15:04 --> 00:15:10
I'm going to add iron to the ocean,
then you'll believe me.  So he said

185
00:15:10 --> 00:15:16
we're going to go out with a boat.
And what they did was, and my lab

186
00:15:16 --> 00:15:22
was involved in these experiments.
We had a small role, that's the

187
00:15:22 --> 00:15:28
boat, in measuring a certain
component of the phytoplankton.

188
00:15:28 --> 00:15:32
But they pumped iron into the
propeller wash of the boat and made

189
00:15:32 --> 00:15:37
a zigzag path in the ocean where
there is about ten kilometers by ten

190
00:15:37 --> 00:15:42
kilometers.  And the natural mixing
in the surface ocean in about a day

191
00:15:42 --> 00:15:47
would mix that iron through that
patch.  And, of course,

192
00:15:47 --> 00:15:52
meanwhile the patch is moving.
The oceans are moving, the patch is

193
00:15:52 --> 00:15:57
moving, they've got these location
buoys, the captain of the ship is

194
00:15:57 --> 00:16:02
going crazy trying to navigate
relative to these buoys rather than

195
00:16:02 --> 00:16:07
relative to the solid earth.
But we were able to actually follow

196
00:16:07 --> 00:16:13
the patch.  And,
oh, here's John Martin who was also

197
00:16:13 --> 00:16:18
a friend of mine.
And sadly enough he died of cancer

198
00:16:18 --> 00:16:24
before the first experiment showed
unequivocally that iron is limiting.

199
00:16:24 --> 00:16:30
But he knew it was so that was good.
Anyway, he threw out this line.

200
00:16:30 --> 00:16:34
“Give me a half a tanker of iron and
I'll give you the next Ice Age.

201
00:16:34 --> 00:16:38
This was before the experiment
because he was trying to drum up

202
00:16:38 --> 00:16:42
enthusiasm for the experiment
because he wanted to do the science.

203
00:16:42 --> 00:16:46
But you see the connection here.
So what's the connection between a

204
00:16:46 --> 00:16:53
tanker of iron and an Ice Age?

205
00:16:53 --> 00:16:57
Exactly.  If you fertilize with iron,
the phytoplankton photosynthesized

206
00:16:57 --> 00:17:02
more.
It could be argued that they draw

207
00:17:02 --> 00:17:07
more CO2 out of the air and will
cool the planet.

208
00:17:07 --> 00:17:12
OK, so he got a lot of attention
because of that,

209
00:17:12 --> 00:17:16
even though this was a scientific
experiment.  So now I'm going to,

210
00:17:16 --> 00:17:21
and we'll come back to that, of
course, later.

211
00:17:21 --> 00:17:26
I'm going to take you on an
oceanographic cruise so you

212
00:17:26 --> 00:17:30
know what it's like.
And this is one that my post-doc

213
00:17:30 --> 00:17:34
went on.  This was not the first
iron fertilization experiment.

214
00:17:34 --> 00:17:38
There have been about five of them
now, but this was one of the

215
00:17:38 --> 00:17:42
actually one of the more recent ones
that was done in the Southern Ocean.

216
00:17:42 --> 00:17:46
They've been done in the subArctic
Pacific, in the Equatorial Pacific.

217
00:17:46 --> 00:17:50
I went on the one in the Equatorial
Pacific because I'm a cruising

218
00:17:50 --> 00:17:54
light-weight, but my post-doc went
on the one in the Southern Ocean and

219
00:17:54 --> 00:17:58
that's where these slides come from.
But just to show you what goes into

220
00:17:58 --> 00:18:02
doing this.
These are the vats where they mixed

221
00:18:02 --> 00:18:06
the iron which they mixed with an
acid solution.

222
00:18:06 --> 00:18:11
And they also put in sulfur
hexafluoride which is an inert

223
00:18:11 --> 00:18:15
tracer so they can use that to trace
the patch.  Here's the oceanographic

224
00:18:15 --> 00:18:20
ship.  What you do when you launch a
cruise is you patch things in these

225
00:18:20 --> 00:18:24
vans.  And sometimes you have your
whole lab in your van.

226
00:18:24 --> 00:18:29
And, in fact, for this trace metal
clean work they have special trace

227
00:18:29 --> 00:18:33
metal clean vans where they're all
Teflon lined and positive air

228
00:18:33 --> 00:18:38
pressure and all of that.
So you ship this out to the

229
00:18:38 --> 00:18:42
Antarctic, and it gets loaded onto
the ship, the van,

230
00:18:42 --> 00:18:46
and then gets tied down.
This is what the lab looks like

231
00:18:46 --> 00:18:51
before the scientists arrive.
It's just a bunch of tables that

232
00:18:51 --> 00:18:55
are tied.  And these labs get broken
down and rebuilt for each cruise

233
00:18:55 --> 00:19:00
because different types of
scientists have different needs.

234
00:19:00 --> 00:19:04
And this is what it looks like when
everybody is settled in.

235
00:19:04 --> 00:19:09
It's a very crude makeshift thing
very crowded with equipment and

236
00:19:09 --> 00:19:13
wires and is all set up temporarily
for a month's worth of work.

237
00:19:13 --> 00:19:18
So here's the shift leaving port.
They're going out of New Zealand

238
00:19:18 --> 00:19:23
which is where most of these cruises
leave from for the Antarctic.

239
00:19:23 --> 00:19:27
Here it is in the rough seas of the
Southern Ocean.  You cannot

240
00:19:27 --> 00:19:32
see this very well.
But that's an iceberg which is a big

241
00:19:32 --> 00:19:38
problem down there,
because that's just the tip of the

242
00:19:38 --> 00:19:44
iceberg.  So navigation is very
tricky.  So here's a radar showing

243
00:19:44 --> 00:19:50
these icebergs scattered around that
they have to look out for.

244
00:19:50 --> 00:19:56
Here's another one.  Here's how the
samples are taken.

245
00:19:56 --> 00:20:02
These little plastic PVC pipes are
all electronically wired.

246
00:20:02 --> 00:20:06
And this ball,
when they're open,

247
00:20:06 --> 00:20:10
is drawn into it.  So when these are
lowered in the water they fill up

248
00:20:10 --> 00:20:14
with water, and then you trigger it
and the ball shuts it and then you

249
00:20:14 --> 00:20:18
bring it up.  So you can set it,
say this one goes off at 5 meters,

250
00:20:18 --> 00:20:22
that one 20, that one 50, that one
100, whatever.

251
00:20:22 --> 00:20:26
Wherever you want them you set them,
and then it comes up and you have

252
00:20:26 --> 00:20:30
your water sample.
Working in the Antarctic is

253
00:20:30 --> 00:20:34
particularly difficult.
In this case this person is out

254
00:20:34 --> 00:20:38
there taking the snow off of these
incubators that have sample water in

255
00:20:38 --> 00:20:42
bottles trying to make the
phytoplankton think that they are

256
00:20:42 --> 00:20:46
still in the ocean,
but they are in controlled

257
00:20:46 --> 00:20:50
experiments here.
And they're taking the ice off so

258
00:20:50 --> 00:20:54
that the light intensity stays the
same.  And this is to summarize the

259
00:20:54 --> 00:20:58
results of the iron fertilization
experiment just in a picture.

260
00:20:58 --> 00:21:02
This is the water without iron added
and this is the water with iron

261
00:21:02 --> 00:21:07
added.  The addition of iron to
these waters causes major algal

262
00:21:07 --> 00:21:12
blooms.  And here is just some of
the data.  We can just look at

263
00:21:12 --> 00:21:16
chlorophyll “a”,
which you know is a measure of

264
00:21:16 --> 00:21:21
phytoplankton biomass in the patch
versus outside of the patch.

265
00:21:21 --> 00:21:26
And this is actually a satellite
image taken off of the NASA

266
00:21:26 --> 00:21:31
satellite of this iron-enriched
patch.

267
00:21:31 --> 00:21:37
So there is no question now that the
availability of iron limits primary

268
00:21:37 --> 00:21:43
productivity over vast regions of
the ocean.  I didn't think I was

269
00:21:43 --> 00:21:50
going to use the board but I will
use the board.

270
00:21:50 --> 00:21:56
And because the Redfield ratio,
which you guys now know, of carbon,

271
00:21:56 --> 00:22:04
some nitrogen, some phosphorus.
Remember?  We talked about this,

272
00:22:04 --> 00:22:13
106:16:1.  If we add iron to this,
iron is about 0.005.  Anyway, tiny

273
00:22:13 --> 00:22:22
amounts of iron are required
relative to nitrogen and phosphorus

274
00:22:22 --> 00:22:31
in order for a phytoplankton
cell to grow.

275
00:22:31 --> 00:22:35
So you can leverage,
if there's abundance of nitrogen and

276
00:22:35 --> 00:22:40
phosphorus, it just takes a little
bit of iron to get this big bloom.

277
00:22:40 --> 00:22:44
And that was very appealing to
people.  Any time it takes a little

278
00:22:44 --> 00:22:49
bit of something to get a lot of
something, I think people get

279
00:22:49 --> 00:22:53
interested.  And I think what
motivated this whole interest in

280
00:22:53 --> 00:22:58
ocean fertilization,
I think, is motivated subconsciously

281
00:22:58 --> 00:23:02
a lot by man's ability to manipulate
a system so large with

282
00:23:02 --> 00:23:07
so little effort.
But that's sort of a [subset?

283
00:23:07 --> 00:23:12
.  So the success of these
scientific experiments,

284
00:23:12 --> 00:23:16
were really just to go out there and
understand what regulated

285
00:23:16 --> 00:23:21
productivity in the oceans,
were picked up very rapidly by

286
00:23:21 --> 00:23:26
entrepreneurs.
And the proposal that was put

287
00:23:26 --> 00:23:31
forward was to develop a commercial
ocean fertilization industry where

288
00:23:31 --> 00:23:36
you'd fertilize the surface
oceans with iron.

289
00:23:36 --> 00:23:40
And I'm kind of joking here that
money comes out the bottom,

290
00:23:40 --> 00:23:45
but I'll show you how this works in
a minute.  And turn this into a

291
00:23:45 --> 00:23:50
business.  And there are a lot of
unknown questions here.

292
00:23:50 --> 00:23:55
First the experiment showed that
you could increase the phytoplankton

293
00:23:55 --> 00:24:00
growth here, but they didn't show
that you could increase this export

294
00:24:00 --> 00:24:05
because the timescale of this is
much longer than you can stay out on

295
00:24:05 --> 00:24:10
a ship to follow it.
So it could be that this is

296
00:24:10 --> 00:24:15
increased and then this arrow is
increased and you have no net flux.

297
00:24:15 --> 00:24:20
There is a little data on this flux
now, but it's not compelling yet.

298
00:24:20 --> 00:24:24
Then the next question is if this
was an industry,

299
00:24:24 --> 00:24:29
could you actually verify how much
carbon was exported, if

300
00:24:29 --> 00:24:33
it could be exported?
And then the collateral effects,

301
00:24:33 --> 00:24:37
which we're going to talk about in a
minute, could it be made profitable?

302
00:24:37 --> 00:24:41
And the biggest question is what
would the unintended consequences be

303
00:24:41 --> 00:24:45
of such an intentional fertilization?
And this is where you guys come in

304
00:24:45 --> 00:24:49
because you have learned in this
class a lot of things that could

305
00:24:49 --> 00:24:53
help you assess what the unintended
consequences are,

306
00:24:53 --> 00:24:57
and we're going to talk about that.
But how could you make money doing

307
00:24:57 --> 00:25:01
this?
And it depends on a lot of things.

308
00:25:01 --> 00:25:07
Right now you couldn't, but there
are people depending on a future in

309
00:25:07 --> 00:25:13
which you could,
and this is the way it works.

310
00:25:13 --> 00:25:18
There is an emerging market in
carbon trading credits,

311
00:25:18 --> 00:25:24
especially for countries that did
sign the Kyoto Accord where there's

312
00:25:24 --> 00:25:30
a commitment to reducing
CO2 emissions.

313
00:25:30 --> 00:25:34
And so these carbon offset credits
are worth money.

314
00:25:34 --> 00:25:39
So the way this would work is,
if it works, was you'd have this

315
00:25:39 --> 00:25:44
industry, you'd fertilize with iron,
you'd be able to claim that you

316
00:25:44 --> 00:25:48
buried X amount of carbon in the
deep ocean.  And with that claim

317
00:25:48 --> 00:25:53
that would give you these carbon
offset credits that are worth money.

318
00:25:53 --> 00:25:58
Utilities companies could then buy
those, and if there was a cap on how

319
00:25:58 --> 00:26:03
much carbon emissions they could
have this would increase their cap.

320
00:26:03 --> 00:26:07
So it's just like,
you've probably heard about tree

321
00:26:07 --> 00:26:11
plantations generating carbon offset
credits.  And that's a going

322
00:26:11 --> 00:26:15
industry now.  So that's how it
would work.  And there are companies,

323
00:26:15 --> 00:26:20
these are some websites.
Planktos.com, they have patents

324
00:26:20 --> 00:26:24
filed on this process.
How they're able to do that is

325
00:26:24 --> 00:26:28
beyond me since it's published in
the open literature,

326
00:26:28 --> 00:26:33
in the scientific literature,
but they do.

327
00:26:33 --> 00:26:37
Their mission is to develop
formulations to [manage?

328
00:26:37 --> 00:26:42
phytoplankton productivity in
carbon export.

329
00:26:42 --> 00:26:46
There's another one that you don't
have in your slides.

330
00:26:46 --> 00:26:51
I just slipped this in this morning.
But here's the website,

331
00:26:51 --> 00:26:55
Green Sea Venture, if you're
interested.  But it's another

332
00:26:55 --> 00:27:00
company that is marketing
this idea.

333
00:27:00 --> 00:27:05
And here's another.
I just saw this ad last month in

334
00:27:05 --> 00:27:10
[EOS?] which is a publication of the
American Geophysical Union.

335
00:27:10 --> 00:27:15
And it seeks professionals to work
on an ocean nourishment

336
00:27:15 --> 00:27:20
demonstration.
This is a new word.

337
00:27:20 --> 00:27:25
The oceans need to be “nourished”.
So there's a psychology here.

338
00:27:25 --> 00:27:30
They'll talk about ocean deserts
that are nutrient poor,

339
00:27:30 --> 00:27:35
need to be nourished.
And this is not only for

340
00:27:35 --> 00:27:40
sequestering CO2,
but the claim is to increase wild

341
00:27:40 --> 00:27:45
fish stocks by fertilization.
And so some of these outfits are

342
00:27:45 --> 00:27:50
really on the edge of credibility,
and I will let you figure that out

343
00:27:50 --> 00:27:55
yourselves.  If you did enough
research you could find out.

344
00:27:55 --> 00:28:00
That's not part of your assignment
for the class.

345
00:28:00 --> 00:28:05
But some of them are actually really
rational-thinking scientists and

346
00:28:05 --> 00:28:10
engineers behind them.
So there's a whole spectrum of

347
00:28:10 --> 00:28:15
people interested in this.
So why am I concerned about it?

348
00:28:15 --> 00:28:21
In fact, one of my good friends,
who is a very good scientist, really

349
00:28:21 --> 00:28:26
thinks we should explore the idea of
fertilizing the Southern Oceans to

350
00:28:26 --> 00:28:31
bring the whales back.
Because he thinks that the whales

351
00:28:31 --> 00:28:35
are gone because the krill are gone,
the krill are gone because the

352
00:28:35 --> 00:28:39
phytoplankton are gone and the
phytoplankton are gone because the

353
00:28:39 --> 00:28:43
whales aren't there to recycle the
iron.  And we don't know any of that,

354
00:28:43 --> 00:28:48
but that's the hypothesis.
He thinks the ecosystem needs to be

355
00:28:48 --> 00:28:52
“jumpstarted” by an iron
fertilization.

356
00:28:52 --> 00:28:56
So just to give you an idea the way
people are starting to think about

357
00:28:56 --> 00:29:01
ecosystems and our ability
to manipulate them.

358
00:29:01 --> 00:29:05
So why am I worried about this?
And why should you be worried?

359
00:29:05 --> 00:29:10
Because you know now from taking
this class that it's not that simple,

360
00:29:10 --> 00:29:15
that ecosystems are complex.
And you know that if you fertilize

361
00:29:15 --> 00:29:20
with iron and you create a lot of
organic carbon,

362
00:29:20 --> 00:29:25
phytoplankton, and some of that
settles, a lot of that settles down

363
00:29:25 --> 00:29:30
to the deep ocean where there is no
productivity, if it's consumed and

364
00:29:30 --> 00:29:35
digested by bacteria oxygen is going
to be consumed, right?

365
00:29:35 --> 00:29:39
And respiration,
heterotrophic bacteria,

366
00:29:39 --> 00:29:43
that's what you learned in the first
set of lectures,

367
00:29:43 --> 00:29:47
oxygen will be consumed and CO2 will
be regenerated.

368
00:29:47 --> 00:29:51
But if you have enough of this it
will actually,

369
00:29:51 --> 00:29:55
the oxygen in the deep ocean waters
will decrease and can even go anoxic

370
00:29:55 --> 00:30:00
if you do it long enough.
And when you change --

371
00:30:00 --> 00:30:04
That's the function of the system,
the oxygen concentration.  You

372
00:30:04 --> 00:30:08
change the community structure of
the system and you'll have a

373
00:30:08 --> 00:30:12
different assemblage of microbes
there than you had before.

374
00:30:12 --> 00:30:17
And one of the things that could
happen, for example,

375
00:30:17 --> 00:30:21
is that you would increase the
ammonia concentration by this

376
00:30:21 --> 00:30:25
reminerialization,
you could stimulate nitrification

377
00:30:25 --> 00:30:29
and denitrification,
which you learned about in my second

378
00:30:29 --> 00:30:34
lecture, I think.
And you remember that a byproduct of

379
00:30:34 --> 00:30:38
that is nitrous oxide.
And nitrous oxide is also a

380
00:30:38 --> 00:30:42
greenhouse gas that is 300 times
more effective molecule per molecule

381
00:30:42 --> 00:30:46
than CO2.  In terms of its
greenhouse capability,

382
00:30:46 --> 00:30:50
in terms of its absorption of heat.
So you're doing this whole thing to

383
00:30:50 --> 00:30:54
suck CO2 out of the atmosphere,
but if a side effect is creating

384
00:30:54 --> 00:30:58
nitrous oxide,
the amounts of which are impossible

385
00:30:58 --> 00:31:02
to predict at this point,
you could be worse off than you

386
00:31:02 --> 00:31:06
started.
And none of these proposals takes

387
00:31:06 --> 00:31:11
this downstream effect into account.
The other thing that can happen in

388
00:31:11 --> 00:31:16
low oxygen waters is the stimulation
of methanogenic bacteria which

389
00:31:16 --> 00:31:21
produce methane that is 22 times
more effective molecule per molecule

390
00:31:21 --> 00:31:26
CO2 as a greenhouse gas.
So there are ecosystem consequences

391
00:31:26 --> 00:31:31
to this.
You cannot just say I'm going to add

392
00:31:31 --> 00:31:35
this and make carbon and that's the
end of it, because you make carbon

393
00:31:35 --> 00:31:40
and things happen to that carbon.
The other thing that is overlooked

394
00:31:40 --> 00:31:44
that you guys know about,
remember this diagram of global

395
00:31:44 --> 00:31:48
ocean circulation?
If you fertilize the Southern Ocean

396
00:31:48 --> 00:31:53
with iron and utilize the nitrogen
and phosphorus here,

397
00:31:53 --> 00:31:57
when those waters upwell over here
along the equation that nitrogen and

398
00:31:57 --> 00:32:02
phosphorus isn't in them.
Now, that nitrogen and phosphorus is

399
00:32:02 --> 00:32:06
fueling the productivity of these
ecosystems upon which fisheries are

400
00:32:06 --> 00:32:11
based.  People are fishing the fish
from those systems.

401
00:32:11 --> 00:32:15
So those people should be able to
say to these people,

402
00:32:15 --> 00:32:19
hey, you took my nitrogen and
phosphorus.  That has to be factored

403
00:32:19 --> 00:32:24
into your balance sheet.
My loss of fish, my loss of income

404
00:32:24 --> 00:32:28
from the fish needs to be factored
into your balance sheet for

405
00:32:28 --> 00:32:33
your carbon credit.
And if you do that the profitability

406
00:32:33 --> 00:32:39
is really marginal.
Finally, there are models from a

407
00:32:39 --> 00:32:44
group at Princeton that show if you
do this in a sustained way that

408
00:32:44 --> 00:32:50
after many, many years,
this is 1500 which is the extreme,

409
00:32:50 --> 00:32:55
but even after 100 years you create,
this is latitude.  Here's the

410
00:32:55 --> 00:33:01
equator 40 degrees,
40 degrees south.

411
00:33:01 --> 00:33:06
So this is a broad swath of the
ocean and this is depth,

412
00:33:06 --> 00:33:11
OK?  So this shows a huge,
huge anoxic zone in the oceans that

413
00:33:11 --> 00:33:16
would be causes by sustained
fertilization in this way.

414
00:33:16 --> 00:33:22
Not surprising, you're making a lot
of organic carbon.

415
00:33:22 --> 00:33:27
It's going to be consumed by
bacteria.  So that is all a story,

416
00:33:27 --> 00:33:32
a scenario to get you thinking about
your future and your relationship

417
00:33:32 --> 00:33:38
with the earth's ecosystems
in the future.

418
00:33:38 --> 00:33:42
Because our relationship with these
systems is changing dramatically.

419
00:33:42 --> 00:33:46
We are now in charge.  We've been
in charge for a while,

420
00:33:46 --> 00:33:50
but we haven't taken the
responsibility of being in charge

421
00:33:50 --> 00:33:54
for a while of these systems.
And your generation is going to be

422
00:33:54 --> 00:33:59
making these kinds of decisions.
As we move forward and we experience

423
00:33:59 --> 00:34:04
the aftermath of some of the
manipulations we've done in the past

424
00:34:04 --> 00:34:09
like burning fossil fuels and
increasing CO2 in the atmosphere

425
00:34:09 --> 00:34:13
there will be choices to make.
Do we just adapt to this global

426
00:34:13 --> 00:34:18
warming or do we know enough about
how the earth works to try to

427
00:34:18 --> 00:34:23
counteract it in ways like
fertilizing the oceans.

428
00:34:23 --> 00:34:28
And then you'll have to decide are
the risks of fertilizing the oceans

429
00:34:28 --> 00:34:33
much greater than the risks of
adapting to climate change?

430
00:34:33 --> 00:34:38
And a new trend in thinking about
the earth is thinking about nature

431
00:34:38 --> 00:34:43
and ecosystems as not simply as
something that we value because

432
00:34:43 --> 00:34:49
they're part of our world and we
should set up reserves so that we

433
00:34:49 --> 00:34:54
can enjoy them and see nature and so
generations in the future will know

434
00:34:54 --> 00:34:59
what natural ecosystems look like,
but starting to think of ecosystems

435
00:34:59 --> 00:35:05
as things that provide services for
humans and actually have a monetary

436
00:35:05 --> 00:35:10
value that is not part of our
economy, it's not part of our

437
00:35:10 --> 00:35:16
economic system but they provide
functions to our world for free.

438
00:35:16 --> 00:35:20
And so as we destroy them we're
losing those functions.

439
00:35:20 --> 00:35:25
And this is a very well known paper.
There's a journal called Ecological

440
00:35:25 --> 00:35:29
Economics that tries to talk about
factoring in ecosystems

441
00:35:29 --> 00:35:35
into our economy.
And this is a very well known paper

442
00:35:35 --> 00:35:41
on the value of the world's
ecosystem services and natural

443
00:35:41 --> 00:35:47
capital.  And course this is
impossible to do but you've got to

444
00:35:47 --> 00:35:53
try.  So they evaluated the
ecosystem services as worth $33

445
00:35:53 --> 00:35:59
trillion.  And this is just a brief
list of some of the services that

446
00:35:59 --> 00:36:04
they analyze in this.
One that's pretty easy to wrap your

447
00:36:04 --> 00:36:08
brain around is the pollination of
crops by insects.

448
00:36:08 --> 00:36:13
We rely on insects to pollinate
crops.  They do it for free and we

449
00:36:13 --> 00:36:18
rely on that.  And just this is
estimated to be worth $6 billion.

450
00:36:18 --> 00:36:22
That if you had to hire somebody to
manually pollinate your crops if

451
00:36:22 --> 00:36:27
there were no bees and all of the
things that are doing it,

452
00:36:27 --> 00:36:32
it would cost $6 billion globally.
There is decomposition of waste,

453
00:36:32 --> 00:36:38
recycling nutrients, dispersion of
seeds, control of pests,

454
00:36:38 --> 00:36:43
purification of the air and water,
ecosystems to do this.  And this is

455
00:36:43 --> 00:36:49
compared to the GNP of $18 trillion
per year, the global gross national

456
00:36:49 --> 00:36:54
product.  So this is sort of a shift
in our thinking about how we think

457
00:36:54 --> 00:37:00
about ecosystems.  And
just in the last --

458
00:37:00 --> 00:37:04
This slide was in one of your
handouts about,

459
00:37:04 --> 00:37:08
I don't know, five lectures ago,
but I didn't get to it so I thought

460
00:37:08 --> 00:37:13
I would bring it in now.
Just in the last, well, April 14th

461
00:37:13 --> 00:37:17
was announced this Millennium
Ecosystem Assessment Report,

462
00:37:17 --> 00:37:21
which was over a thousand scientists
worldwide assessing the state of the

463
00:37:21 --> 00:37:26
earth's global ecosystems and from
the point of view of strengthening

464
00:37:26 --> 00:37:30
capacity to manage ecosystem's
sustainability for

465
00:37:30 --> 00:37:35
human well-being.
So the focus is on how do we manage

466
00:37:35 --> 00:37:39
these things for ourselves and the
future generation?

467
00:37:39 --> 00:37:43
And you can go to the website if
you want to get depressed.

468
00:37:43 --> 00:37:47
Well, you can get depressed about
what we've done.

469
00:37:47 --> 00:37:52
But you can be optimistic that
we're really facing up to this

470
00:37:52 --> 00:37:56
challenge in a very systematic way.
But the bottom line is that

471
00:37:56 --> 00:38:00
two-thirds of the natural machinery
of the earth has already been

472
00:38:00 --> 00:38:05
degraded by humans.
And water use is dramatic.

473
00:38:05 --> 00:38:10
Major rivers are dry before they
reach the oceans.

474
00:38:10 --> 00:38:15
We are mining groundwater basically.
We're taking water out of the

475
00:38:15 --> 00:38:20
ground much faster than it's being
recharged.  One-quarter of all fish

476
00:38:20 --> 00:38:25
stocks are already over-harvested.
I mean we're in a non-sustainable

477
00:38:25 --> 00:38:30
mode.  I don't need to tell you.
You read the newspaper and you know

478
00:38:30 --> 00:38:35
this, and so I'll skip over this.
Oh, just this last part I think is

479
00:38:35 --> 00:38:39
the most important.
The argument is that more and more

480
00:38:39 --> 00:38:43
people are going to be living in the
cities in the future,

481
00:38:43 --> 00:38:47
so less and less in touch with
nature.  So nature is going to be

482
00:38:47 --> 00:38:52
more and more of an abstraction to
us.  And people are really worried

483
00:38:52 --> 00:38:56
about this because conservation of
natural spaces is not just a luxury.

484
00:38:56 --> 00:39:00
This is a dangerous illusion that
ignores our dependency

485
00:39:00 --> 00:39:05
on these systems.
And we have to really strengthen

486
00:39:05 --> 00:39:09
that understanding.
OK, so now I want to lead you,

487
00:39:09 --> 00:39:14
this slide several students have
told me is the only thing they

488
00:39:14 --> 00:39:18
remember from this class and my
other ecology class.

489
00:39:18 --> 00:39:23
And that makes me very happy.
If this is the only thing you

490
00:39:23 --> 00:39:27
remember that's great because this
is really the take-home message for

491
00:39:27 --> 00:39:32
you and your generation.
And this is how we have changed our

492
00:39:32 --> 00:39:36
relationship to the earth and this
is where we are right now.

493
00:39:36 --> 00:39:41
So you learned in the first lecture
about the biosphere,

494
00:39:41 --> 00:39:46
autotrophs producing organic carbon,
heterotrophs consuming organic

495
00:39:46 --> 00:39:50
carbon and with a little bit of
input from the earth's crust,

496
00:39:50 --> 00:39:55
nitrogen and phosphorus, and this
system running pretty well

497
00:39:55 --> 00:40:00
before humans.
And before the Industrial Revolution

498
00:40:00 --> 00:40:04
societies fit into this system of
tight recycling taking a little bit

499
00:40:04 --> 00:40:09
off of the autotrophic productivity
and putting a little bit of waste

500
00:40:09 --> 00:40:14
into the system.
But then we had the Industrial

501
00:40:14 --> 00:40:18
Revolution.  We've cut down massive
amounts of trees.

502
00:40:18 --> 00:40:23
we've changed the very landscape of
the autotrophic system,

503
00:40:23 --> 00:40:28
and we've dramatically increased the
waste stream.

504
00:40:28 --> 00:40:32
And we're mining the lithosphere in
a huge way, elements,

505
00:40:32 --> 00:40:36
mining for metals and things used in
manufacturing,

506
00:40:36 --> 00:40:40
etc., which is,
of course, increasing this waste

507
00:40:40 --> 00:40:45
stream.  So this is where we are now.
And we know that this is not

508
00:40:45 --> 00:40:49
sustainable the way we're operating.
So this is your generation's

509
00:40:49 --> 00:40:53
decision.  Are you going to go this
way or are you going to go that way?

510
00:40:53 --> 00:40:57
Very simple.  You've got to point
your compass in the

511
00:40:57 --> 00:41:02
right direction.
So this way just increases these

512
00:41:02 --> 00:41:07
streams, the waste stream and the
erosion of the natural ecosystems

513
00:41:07 --> 00:41:11
and the mining from the lithosphere.
This stream works toward recycling

514
00:41:11 --> 00:41:16
within the societies that we've
already built,

515
00:41:16 --> 00:41:21
restoring natural ecosystems so they
can do their functions properly for

516
00:41:21 --> 00:41:26
cleaning air and water,
and leaving enough productivity for

517
00:41:26 --> 00:41:31
the rest of the heterotrophs
on land.

518
00:41:31 --> 00:41:35
You know we're not the only
heterotrophs.  There are all these

519
00:41:35 --> 00:41:40
other species that rely on this
primary productivity,

520
00:41:40 --> 00:41:45
the birds and, well, all the species.
So we need to leave some of that

521
00:41:45 --> 00:41:50
for them so the ecosystems can
sustain themselves.

522
00:41:50 --> 00:41:55
And so this is where we should be.
And we just need to find the will

523
00:41:55 --> 00:42:00
to get there.  So easily
said, not easily done.

524
00:42:00 --> 00:42:04
And there's an organization called
The Natural Step.

525
00:42:04 --> 00:42:08
I put this website,
which you might want to write down

526
00:42:08 --> 00:42:12
because I don't think this was on
your slide, if you're interested you

527
00:42:12 --> 00:42:16
can write it down,
that I think has a very,

528
00:42:16 --> 00:42:20
very creative approach to working
with industry to try to direct

529
00:42:20 --> 00:42:24
things in the right direction and
where they talk about the compass.

530
00:42:24 --> 00:42:28
And they say there are basic system
conditions for sustainability that

531
00:42:28 --> 00:42:33
if we don't maintain we will be
going in the wrong direction.

532
00:42:33 --> 00:42:37
And it's just a total no-brainer.
It's very simple.  Substances from

533
00:42:37 --> 00:42:41
the earth's crust must not
systematically increase in nature.

534
00:42:41 --> 00:42:45
Obviously, that's not sustainable
if you do that and substances

535
00:42:45 --> 00:42:49
produced by society must not
systematically increase in nature.

536
00:42:49 --> 00:42:53
We cannot keep pouring waste into
nature.  The physical basis for the

537
00:42:53 --> 00:42:57
productivity and diversity of nature,
i.e., the green part,

538
00:42:57 --> 00:43:02
the autotrophic cycle cannot be
systematically deteriorated.

539
00:43:02 --> 00:43:06
And then they add to this we must be
efficient enough to meet basic human

540
00:43:06 --> 00:43:11
needs.  We have to work toward
efficiency which is working toward

541
00:43:11 --> 00:43:16
tightening this recycling here.
And they've been very effective in

542
00:43:16 --> 00:43:21
many countries in pointing
industries in the right direction.

543
00:43:21 --> 00:43:25
Every time that they make a
decision about what metal to use in

544
00:43:25 --> 00:43:30
a particular manufacturing process,
they look at how much of that metal

545
00:43:30 --> 00:43:36
has already been mined.
Is there an alternative metal that

546
00:43:36 --> 00:43:42
they could, etc.
They're constantly using at this

547
00:43:42 --> 00:43:48
compass.  OK.  Obviously,
the compass is not pointed in the

548
00:43:48 --> 00:43:54
right direction.
A no-brainer.  Building cars that

549
00:43:54 --> 00:44:00
use more fuel and get less miles per
gallon is not the right direction.

550
00:44:00 --> 00:44:05
So some of these are very easy to
answer.  And I don't want to cast

551
00:44:05 --> 00:44:10
dispersion on SUVs,
but in case you didn't recognize it

552
00:44:10 --> 00:44:16
that's what that is.
I mean fuel efficiency is here,

553
00:44:16 --> 00:44:21
we can have it if we want to, and we
need to work on that.

554
00:44:21 --> 00:44:27
And finally, well, this isn't
finally.  This is second to finally.

555
00:44:27 --> 00:44:32
I love this cartoon.
This is the [doctor Saturn?

556
00:44:32 --> 00:44:36
or whatever looking at the earth
and diagnosing our planet at this

557
00:44:36 --> 00:44:41
stage in its evolution.
And finally I'll leave you with

558
00:44:41 --> 00:44:46
this image which is my favorite
image of the earth because it has no

559
00:44:46 --> 00:44:50
national boundaries and it really
does remind us that it's a living

560
00:44:50 --> 00:44:55
planet and that time is now.
I mean, I know this sounds

561
00:44:55 --> 00:45:00
overdramatic but it's not.
I mean we've changed this planet so

562
00:45:00 --> 00:45:04
much in the last 200 years relative
to all the years before.

563
00:45:04 --> 00:45:09
And the next 50 years, your time to
make a difference is absolutely

564
00:45:09 --> 00:45:13
critical, so I hope you guys will go
off and save the planet for us.

565
00:45:13 --> 00:45:16
Have fun and have a great summer.
