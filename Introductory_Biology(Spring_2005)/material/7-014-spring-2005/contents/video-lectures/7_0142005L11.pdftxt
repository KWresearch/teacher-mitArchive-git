Transcript â€“ Lecture 11 

So just trying to remind you that the replication fork looks something like this where 
5 prime to 3 prime and 5 prime to 3 prime. This is what's known as the lead ing 
strand because DNA, the synthesis of the new strand can go -- Which is going 5 
prime to 3 prime is going in the same direction as the movement of the replication 
fork. The other strand, which is known as the lagging strand, the DNA synthesis is 
actually going backwards to the movement of the replication fork, which means it 
has to go and then start up here and go again. 

And it's continually jump ing. And I told you that the little RNA primer is used to start 
each strand. And then the DNA polymerase is able to elongate that. And then at the 
end these little nicks in here, the RNA has to be removed, fill in the gap and then  it's 
sealed up by the enzyme DNA ligase, which we'll talk about when we ta lk about 
recombinant DNA. 

Someone asked, I had mentioned why this strategy of using RNA was beneficial, and 
that has to do with the fact that the fidelity, which is going to be the next thing I'm 
going to  focus on of DNA rep lication is not, you can get a much higher accuracy if 
you have the end of a primer already there and  then carry out the chemistry in 
there. No enzyme has ever achieved the accuracy that you see in DNA rep lication if 
it's starting a strand. 

So RNA polymerase, which constantly starts strands to make RNA copies, as we'll 
talk about, is not as accurate as DNA replication. And by putting a little b it of RNA, 
because the cell has to start a new strand. Before it gets here there's no strand at all 
on this lagg ing strand so  it needs to make this little RNA primer. It needs to make a 
little primer. And by making it out of RNA then it can tell what doesn't belong there. 
It doesn't matter if it's not quite as accurate as the rest of DNA replications because 
it's going to take it out anyway and fill it in using the DNA polymerase. 

And if you think about that maybe you can see one of the reasons that the cell has 
chosen or nature has chosen through evolution to use little RNAs to beg in the 
strands. OK. Well, in any case, the fidelity of DNA replication is really pretty 
amazing. Incidentally, just speaking of DNA, many of you wrote some very 
thoughtful things about Vernon Ingram's visit. I didn't give him a whole lot of 
warning and he had to go and change his schedule and move meetings around in 
order to come to ta lk to you. 

And it was very nice of you. Many of you wrote some very thoughtful things, which 
I'm going to pass onto him. I want him to know  that many of you appreciated his 
visit. I also saw a lot of you react to his advice about crowded labs. That has been 
my experience, too. And one thing about the scientific process is it's not just one 
person. You're in with a group of people, just as Vernon described, and that group of 
people becomes the creative engine that drives all the science within that lab. 

And so you're not only picking your project, you're looking for a group of people to 
work with. And, as Vernon said, if the  lab is really doing hot stuff they tend to attract 

a lot of people. So a crowded lab can sometimes be a  rea lly good ind icator. No 
absolutes, and there's an exception to everything, but that was a good p iece of 
advice he gave you  if you're looking for UROPs sometimes. 

OK. So, anyway, DNA  fidelity. Remember I sa id we've gone from, our bodies have 
somewhere from like 10 to 20 b illion miles of DNA in them if we could take all the 
human DNA and stretch it out? But that fidelity is done at an error rate of about one 
mistake to every ten to the minus tenth nucleotides replicated. Which I said if you 
were typ ing all the time it would be like sort of making one mistake every 38 years. 

So it's an astonishing degree of fidelity. Something that's beyond anything within our 
experience. And there are three principles that go. One is polymerase  is really good 
at the base pa ir recognition telling that an A is paired with a T or a G is paired w ith a 
C. And d iscriminating against everything else. There's a phenomenon known as 
proofreading, and  I'll tell you how that works. 

And then there's a third system ca lled mismatch repa ir. And all three of these 
contribute to this very, very low-frequency of errors, one mistake for approximately 
every ten to the tenth nucleotides replicated. So the first thing is I've pointed out to 
you several times that if you draw the hydrogen bonds between an A and a T base 
pair, the two hydrogen bonds or the three hydrogen bonds between a G and C base 
pair, that the shapes of this pa ir and that pa ir are virtua lly identica l. 

You can pick them up and lay it right down on top. Now, if you actually look at  it 
you'll see you could draw some base pairs between, for examp le, a G and a T. In 
fact, you can draw two hydrogen bonds, which is the same as between an A and a T. 
But the one thing I hope you can see, just from  the shapes even without being able 
to see the ind ividua l atoms, is that a GT base pa ir doesn't have the same shape as 
the correct base pairs. 

So when I showed you that little movie the other day where this is the template 
nucleotide, this is the incoming nucleotide and there's this alpha helix that's sw inging 
up. What's happening in there is that the enzyme is checking the way that the 
incoming nucleotide is the correct shape to go w ith the base pa ir. And you can sort 
of see it's flipp ing it right into a very narrow little slot in the enzyme. 

So it's not only asking for sort of hydrogen bonds, it's asking for the exact shape. If 
you just d id it by thermodynamic grounds you'd make about one mistake in a 
hundred because that's about the discrimination between the correct base pairs and 
some of these other ones. This works so well. You get more like one mistake in ten 
to the fourth or ten to the fifth. 

We're still quite a distance away from the ten to the tenth, but this is one of the 
things. It's looking for the correct shape of the base pa ir. Now, the second thing that 
helps with  fidelity is a phenomenon known as proofreading -- -- exonuclease. Things 
called a nuclease. That means it can degrade DNA. And the exo works at an end. 
And, furthermore, the d irectiona lity of this proofreading was something that puzzled 
people initially because it's going 3 prime to 5 prime. 

And when people started to purify DNA polymerases or comp lexes of DNA 
polymerases involved in replication there seemed to be a puzz le because the 
polymerase, as I've told you, goes 5 prime to 3 prime, but the same enzyme 
complex had an exonuclease that went in the opposite d irection. So this seemed very 

peculiar at first in the sense if you were trying to polymerize DNA in this way why in 
that same enzyme would you have something that wanted to degrade DNA in the 
other way? And the answer turned out that this was known as a proofread ing 
exonuclease, as I've put up here. 

And here's the principle of how it works. Suppose you were rep licating the DNA and 
there was a G. And if you put a C in there it very quickly goes on and continues the 
replication. If it puts in a T, let's say, this is not a very good base pa ir. It wouldn't 
have the right shape. So when the enzyme came up looking for that 3 prime 
hydroxyl, which would be right at the end of that T, things are not in the right place. 

And so the polymerase activity slows down. And as that primer terminus, if it sits 
there for a little b it, it's ab le to just peel off the DNA, flip up, and there's this function 
that does just what you'd do if you were typ ing and you made a mistake. You'd just 
hit the delete key and take off the last nucleotide that you d id. And I have a little 
movie showing you that. 

This is a crystal structure. This is the DNA template. And the polymerase catalytic 
activity site is right here. And in this little movie it's just added an incorrect base pair 
and the polymerase is sort of sta lled. And the actual nuclease function is physically 
separate on the protein structure. But what you'll see in the movie is that if the 
polymerase cannot go very well eventually this thing will come up and it w ill chop off 
one nucleotide, come back and try it aga in. 

Let's see. I think if we do this, oopsy-daisey. Let me see if I can get this to work 
here. Nope, it's not working. OK. Well, anyway, I'm going to skip it for right now. I 
don't want to waste time. But, in any case, the end would go up here and it would 
take off one nucleotide. So there at least are two of the ways that the polymerase is 
able to work with such fidelity. 

It selects for the correct base pair shape. And then after it's done an addition  it sort 
of looks back, just as if you were a very slow typist, and every time you typed a 
letter you looked back and said did  I make a mistake? And if you made a mistake 
then you'd delete and then just try aga in. And that gets the cell another maybe two 
orders of magnitude of accuracy. So we're up to about one mistake in ten to the 
seventh base pairs replicated. 

The third system, which is called mismatch repa ir, turns out to be very important for 
a whole variety of reasons. And before I tell you about it, I want to  first introduce the 
idea of DNA repa ir in genera l. One of the things that's wonderful about DNA -- -- as 
you've learned, is it's got the information in two copies. It's in a complimentary form 
but it's like having the photograph and the negative. 

And if your kid sister pokes a hole w ith a pair of scissors through the picture of your 
boyfriend or your girlfriend, you're not rea lly in troub le as long as you've got the 
negative because you can get the information back again. And that same princip le 
applies in DNA repa ir. So if you have some kind of lesion in DNA, and this might 
have come from going outside in the sunlight, your DNA absorbs in the UV and it 
undergoes photoreactions, they tend, for the most part, to just effect one of the two 
strands of DNA. 

Or if you smoke, which I hope none of you do, there are many chemica ls in smoke 
that will react w ith DNA, and they'll modify one strand. And so what the cell has is a 

system that has many kinds of repa ir systems, but it has a special type of repair 
system known as nucleotide excision repa ir. And you could think of this as a protein 
machine that constantly scans the DNA looking for little d istortions. 

And if it finds it then what it needs to do  is it needs to make cuts, remove the DNA 
and make a little gap. And now you can see what it can do now. Once it's got a little 
gap the information over here is a complimentary form. So if a DNA polymerase 
were to come a long it could  fill in that gap and seal it up and then you'd be back to 
ordinary DNA, the lesion would be gone. And I made a silly little PowerPoint thing 
here to show it. 

So if you were to, say, damage the guanine w ith something, say one of the 
carcinogens you find in cigarette smoke, you could think of this protein machine as 
being a sort of pa ir of scissors that have a conditionality  in them. As this protein 
machine scans along the DNA the scissors aren't activated until it recognizes there's 
a distortion here, at which point then it senses that there's some bump in the DNA. 

And it's very cleaver the way it does it because the nuclease activities, the things 
that are going to cut the DNA are actually some distance away, a few nucleotides 
away from the lesion. So even  if this is d istorting the DNA, the scissors are able to 
work out here and out here. It makes two cuts. That was a huge surprise. Nobody 
expected that when they started to do the biochemistry. 

And then in princip le once you cut it now you can remove this  little nucleotide and 
then a DNA polymerase can just come in, and  follow ing those A pairs with T, G pairs 
with C, copy  it along and then would sea l it up to get to  the end. And I've actua lly 
shown you a picture of what happens  if a human is missing that system. When I was 
show ing you how profound an effect you could get from just losing one single gene 
or a mutation affecting one single gene, this d isease called xeroderma p igmentosum. 

They're a variety of different groups. And the one on the left is an example. That's 
someone who is missing one of the genes that encodes one of the proteins involved 
in nucleotide excision repa ir. And this is really, really important for fixing up the 
damage we get a ll the time in sunlight. So if you miss that repa ir system and you got 
out in the sun then you get all kinds of lesions and people are very susceptible to 
skin cancer. 

And I told you fortunately now you don't find people w ith this disease looking like 
that because at least in developed countries we recognize it. They're kept out of the 
sun. And these were the kids who I said are called "children of the moon" because 
they,  for examp le, go to summer camps where they do everything at night so they 
won't get exposed to sunlight. 

But that's what happens to us if we miss that excision repa ir. And, again, what 
makes that possib le is that the information is there twice in a double-stranded DNA. 
I a lso showed you a little movie early on when I was showing you, I'm going to 
actually run this in QuickTime because it works a little more smoothly, I think. So I 
showed you this when we were talking about DNA because I wanted you to sort of 
get that sense of what it was like to kind of fly down the groove of a DNA. 

But what I didn't emphasize was this protein that was bound  to the DNA. That's a 
protein that's a DNA repa ir protein. And it's one of these things that  looks for lesions 
in the DNA. And as we fly along the major groove this little green thing is actua lly 

the lesion that that protein is  looking for. And it sort of puts fingers down into the 
groove and it's able to sense that. 

And you can sort of see how this protein is bound to DNA. This is a lesion that we get 
all the time from oxidative damage. And remember I sa id oxygen is bad  for DNA? So 
our bod ies have to have systems that are able to do that. So DNA repa ir is very 
important for life. We'll just finish  flying down the major groove one more time here. 
OK. I'm going to go back to PowerPoint. OK. 

So mismatch repa ir is a form of repair that's got that same idea. Let's think about it 
if we had a  replication fork here, and let's say there was a G here and the T got 
misincorporated, but in this case it wasn't removed by the proofread ing which 
happens about one in ten to the seventh times. Now if that strand is fixed up, excuse 
me,  is continued then you'd end up with a GT base pa ir. And the next time you 
copied it this strand would give rise to a GC but this one would g ive rise to an AT. 

And then you'd have a mutation that now would have changed. And if it affected an 
important gene that could be bad for you. So the cell has what's known as a 
mismatch repair -- -- that works in exactly the same logic as here. That it basically 
comes along. It scans the DNA. It finds the bump because this is not a proper base 
pair. 

And then it fills it in and you're back to ordinary DNA w ith a GC base pa ir. There's 
one  little wrinkle. For this system to work it has to do one other thing that's different 
from that kind of DNA repa ir. Can anybody see what it is? Why don't you talk to the 
person next to you and see if you can  figure it out. This system must be doing 
something else in order for this to work. 

OK, you can ask somebody. What do you think? What if I removed the gene? Would 
that work? What would happen if I took the gene instead? Say I made the little gap 
over on this strand instead, cut it here? Yeah. So which one is the one that's right, 
the old strand or the new strand? The old strand, yeah. See, this is the old and this 
is the new. And the term that's usua lly used, it's known as the daughter strand, the 
new strand. 

So the other thing this system has to do  is it not only has to be able to detect that 
there's an incorrect little base pa ir in there, but  it a lso has to know which is the 
parenta l strand, the temp late strand, and which is the daughter strand, the newly 
synthesized strand. And this system makes the assumption that the strand that's old 
is the one that's correct and the mistake is on the new one. 

You guys see that? OK. So that gets another two or three orders of magnitude in 
accuracy and that's what brings it up. Now, the people who made this, who 
formulated this model for mismatch repa ir, complete w ith the feature that it needed 
to recognize the old and new strand, that's a bit of a trick, if you think about it 
because it's DNA on both sides. And there are severa l d ifferent ways used in nature, 
so I'm not going to go  into it, but there's at  least a couple of different ways of doing 
that trick. 

You could sort of see if you were the rep lication  fork and you ta lked to that you could 
certainly, just from the geometry of that, if you wanted, you could probably keep 
track of who's old and new. E. coli has a very cute trick, but it's not universa l so I 

won't go into it, but the peop le who did the seminal stuff, I had to just quickly show 
you a couple of p ictures. 

When I showed you that p icture of the DNA 50th, the guy sitting in the front row was 
Miroslav Radman who was one of the two people. He's a European scientist origina lly 
from Croatia. And he collaborated with someone you've heard about before, Matt 
Meselson, who was up at Harvard. And it was with the Meselson-Stahl experiment 
that showed the semi-conservative mechanism of DNA repair. 

This was a little reception. And Matt was talking to Alex R ich who's in the MIT Biology 
Department. And I was amused because remember how Vernon told you how Francis 
Crick would  run up and down the stairs in the Cambridge  lab and he was talking a ll 
the time? And I've heard Vernon say you could never really tell whether an idea 
came from Watson or Crick because they'd just talk, talk, ta lk all the time. 

So this was at sort of nice reception at the DNA 50th. And w ithin a couple of 
minutes, I looked over and there were Miroslav Radman and Matt Meselson ta lk, 
talk, talk. They were in the corner drawing p ictures on a board. I also showed you 
actually a p icture of one of the genes that's involved in recogniz ing this mismatch, 
because there's a protein that recognizes that mismatch and it's g iven the name of 
MutS. 

And when I was showing you some proteins it had one that had a lot of alpha 
helices. This is actua lly a picture of MutS. It's a dimer. That's why some of it's green 
and some of it's blue. And this is DNA viewed end on and it's recognizing a GT 
mismatch in DNA in that p icture. Now, this may sound very esoteric, you know, and 
obviously important for life and an important part of sort of understanding how life 
works if you're interesting in studying molecular biology. 

It may not seem to have very much connection to your real life. But, in fact, in this 
case mismatch repair does because  it affects the frequency w ith which, if you lose it, 
then when you rep licate your DNA you're going to make more mistakes. And I need 
to just give you a very quick introduction to cancer so you can see why this is 
important. Cancer comes from the fact that remember a human cell or a multi-cell 
like us that has many kinds of different cells starts out from one cell. 

And I talked about first you get the embryonic stem cells that can become anything. 
And the cells become successively more and more and more specialized as they go 
along. So ultimately a cell that's in your retina or in, say, the lining of your colon 
needs to know that's where it belongs. And it also needs to know that it cannot just 
keep  rep licating. So if this is actually showing a  little picture of the lining of your 
intestine. 

And there's a sing le layer of cells right a long the inside edge of your intestines. This 
is the cells through which all the nutrient exchange happens and everything else 
when your body extracts nutrients as food stuff passes through your intestine. And 
so what happens w ith cancer is a cell that's normally a part of your body has to obey 
a whole set of rules. 

And what you can think of when someone starts to develop cancer is that what 
started out as an ordinary cell undergoes some kind of successive changes in its DNA 
that gradually causes  it to  forget the rules that make it be part of an organized body 
system. So if we take a look here at a ll these different cells. But let's imagine just 

one of the gets a change that makes it forget to stop, or it should know to stop 
replicating when it touches its neighbors, but  if a cell were to lose that control what 
would happen? Well, it would then begin to proliferate. 

And then what happens in cancer is the cell will, now there are more of them, and 
one cell w ith acquire an additional mutation that will lead to a further loss of growth 
control. You can see now  the cells are starting to become sort of funny shapes. And 
then one of the cells in here w ill undergo yet another change. And  right at this point, 
up until now, the cancer has, even though the cells are d ividing and have lost some 
of their growth control they're still staying in the same p lace. 

So that would be sort of, you know, like a wart or something like that, or what you 
would hear as a benign tumor. You can go in surgica lly and take it away. But then 
the other thing that can happen is cells can forget where they're supposed to be in 
the body. And when that happens they say the cells metastasize and become 
metastatic or a malignant tumor. And what that means  is the cell  is beginning to, it's 
acquired yet another change that's made it forget which part of the body it's 
supposed to be in. 

And they've signified it here as being a change in this cell that then  leads to, you can 
see here right now it's starting to invade into the whole  intestine. Or if one of those 
cells comes off loose in your bloodstream it can  land somewhere else in your body 
and then start to grow there. And that's what happens when somebody has 
metastatic cancer. You cannot really cure  it because now there are cancer cells all 
over the body. 

And that usually is a very difficult situation to get any kind of cure on. So to put this 
in perspective, you needed to have a number of changes to go from an ordinary cell 
to a metastatic cancer cell. So each one of these changes there was some kind of 
change in the DNA. Either there was a mutation or maybe a chromosome was lost or 
something like this so that you need a series of successive genetic a lterations. 

So there was a very key insight that a number of peop le had after we understood the 
mechanism of mismatch repair. Because some people realized that if a human cell 
had lost mismatch repa ir then the frequency of each one of these changes would go 
up. It wouldn't affect what the change was. It wouldn't actua lly have anything to do, 
if you lost mismatch repair it wouldn't affect directly the ab ility of this cell to stop 
divid ing when  it touches its neighbors. 

But it would increase the chances that a mutation somewhere would have that effect. 
And if every one of these steps goes now a hundred or a thousand times faster, you 
can see that if somebody  loses mismatch repair in a cell then the chances of that cell 
becoming into a cancer are very high. So there was a kind of human cancer, it's a 
susceptibility to colon cancer called hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer. 

You don't need to remember the name. It's often abbreviated HNPCC  for peop le who 
cannot remember the name. But it was a kind of susceptibility to cancer that ran in 
families. So it was thought to be genetica lly determined in some way. And one of the 
interesting things was a number of the peop le who had this disease would show a 
kind of instability of the genome if they looked in the tumors. 

They just looked at the DNA. It seemed to be undergoing changes at a much  faster 
rate. And the insight that came out was that the people who had this d isease had, 

for examp le, a mutation affecting what we can think of as a human homolog of 
MutS. And we'll talk about genetics of humans in a small number of weeks, but I 
think most of you know that for most genes, except for the genes associated with 
the sex chromosomes, you get one copy of a gene from mom and another copy of a 
gene from dad. 

So under most circumstances we would have two good copies of this gene encoding 
a human homolog of MutS. What does that human homolog of MutS do? The same 
thing as the bacteria. It recognizes a mismatch in DNA and fixes it up. So it turned 
out that what the peop le w ith this disease have is they have one of the genes. The 
gene they got from mom or the gene they got from dad is broken. So they're still 
OK. They have one copy of mismatch repair in every cell. 

But if a cell ever had lost that copy of the good version now that cell and all of its 
descendents would mutate at something like a hundred or a thousand times the 
normal probability. And so they would progress down this pathway. And so the 
polyposis means that if they look in the colons of peop le who have this disease they 
find lots and lots of little growths or polyps that are on their way to progressing down 
this disease. 

Even in these people it takes quite a while. And so once they knew that they were 
able to go  in and through colonoscopies find these cancers and  remove them. And 
most of you w ill not have that d isease, but this is now a kind of cancer that's pretty 
much preventab le as long as it gets detected. It can take in a normal person as long 
as 20 years or something for an initia l cell that underwent this initia l change to go a ll 
the way down to becoming metastatic. 

So when you get older, and this certainly app lies to most of your parents or in this 
age group, you should ask them  if they've had a colonoscopy. It's not the world's 
most fun procedure because, you know, they stick a probe and  look inside your 
intestine, but it isn't that bad. And what they do is if they see one of these little 
polyps they can catch  it before it's progressed far enough to be metastatic. 

And then there's no problem. I had my first one done about, I don't know,  three or 
four years ago and they found one. And  they took it out and I'm fine. But if it had 
been left there and a llowed to progress then some years down the line I would have 
gotten colon cancer. And I'm going to have to go back and get checked aga in in 
another year or two. 

But it is something that you should check w ith your parents because everybody 
should have a colonoscopy. My hope is by the time you guys reach an age when this 
comes they'll probably have some kind of little b lood test or something where you 
won't have to go through this ind ignity. But right at the moment it's something 
everyone should do, I think. I just wanted to make one other comment about basic 
research because there's another thing here. 

Actually, my  lab was the first lab to clone the MutS gene. We cloned it, we 
sequenced it, and we looked in the databases. And at that time in the late eighties 
there was nothing else that looked like it. I thought it would be  like, there were some 
sort of similar mutants, and here's what it looked like. This is a culture of E. coli. And 
there are about ten to the ninth cells per ml. 

And we plated about ten to the ninth or ten to the eighth on a plate w ith a drug on 
it. And you can see they almost all d ied, but there were maybe three or four that 
survived. And then their descendents were able to grow up and  form a colony. This is 
how we recognized something was defective and what we now know as mismatch 
repair. If you took this mutant of E. 

coli and p lated it out, you'd see you got a  lot more drug-resistant colonies. That's the 
difference that I was describing, the importance of mismatch repair. If you don't 
have mismatch repa ir you can see, you get a lot more mistakes that show up as 
mutants. So I was studying that. And we cloned the MutS and MutL genes which is 
another gene that's involved in this. Didn't see anything in the database, but there 
were very similar mutants  in streptococcus pneumonia that peop le had isolated. 

Remember streptococcus pneumonia  in the transformation experiments? So I 
thought, well, maybe these are the same genes on an evolutionary basis. So I 
phoned some labs, and I found one that was sequencing what turned out to be a 
homolog of MutS. We tried to publish our papers in a medium  fancy journa l because 
I thought this was a pretty cool result that two bacteria that were evolutionarily 
diverged had this conserved mechanism for mismatch repa ir, but the reviewer sa id, 
you know,  this is a pretty specia lized top ic, it's not of general interest, it should go 
in, the phrase they use is "a more specialized journal". 

So it was published in the Journa l of Bacteriology which is a really wonderful journal, 
but it basically deals with bacteria. And about a week after that paper came out my 
phone rang and it was a guy from Emory. And he sa id, "I work on mouse. We were 
sequencing a gene," it doesn't matter what, "and we sequenced in the wrong 
direction. And we seem to have something called MutS. 

Do you know anything about MutS?" And a coup le of days after that I got a phone 
call from somebody at NIH. And they said the same thing, "We were trying to 
sequence this gene in humans. We kind of sequenced in the wrong direction and 
found MutS." So within a week of the paper coming out I knew there were mouse 
and human homologs. And that led  from these sorts of studies, which my first 
graduate student worked on, to the identification of the human homologs. 

And then not me but others made the connection between mismatch repair and 
cancer. But this is the way a lot of things happen w ith basic research. This doesn't 
look like anything that's very important. And it sure doesn't look like it's going to 
lead to an insight into cancer, but this is very much the way it goes. I've had this 
happen twice w ith another set of genes in my life that turned out to be  important for 
cancer as well. 

And, as I said, what happens, if you lose mismatch repair, then a ll these alterations 
happen much more quickly and the cells can become cancerous. I've included a 
coup le of outtakes because I actually made this slide w ith my son's pillowcase on our 
dining room counter. And our cats, who you saw at some point earlier in the year, 
thought this was the weirdest thing they had ever seen, when I brought these plates 
home. 

So, OK, anyway. All right. So one other thing to  tell you about DNA rep lication before 
I move on, and that is -- -- the initiation of DNA rep lication. In E. coli there's one 
great big piece of DNA. And it's all one giant circular chromosome. And if you realize 
what I've told you about DNA replication, I've ta lked to you only about once you 

have a replication fork estab lished how you keep it going. But, as you might guess, a 
really important point of b iological control is the  initiation of DNA replication. 

And so the way cells do that is they have a special sequence in their DNA. It's 
written just with Gs and Cs and As and Ts, but it's a word sort of written in a 
different language than the kind of genetic code we're going to be talking about in 
the next coup le of lectures. And what it means is "start replication here". And so in 
E. coli these are ca lled an orig in of DNA rep lication. 

And, for example, in E. coli it's a stretch of DNA that's about 250 base pairs long. 
And it's got a sequence that lets proteins b ind and they kind of are able to make a 
little bubble like this. And it's at the edges of this little bubb le where it's able to start 
a rep lication  fork. And one of the secrets to control of cell division is that cells are 
able then to control whether the protein that sees the origin is there or not. 

And it won't start a new round of replication unless everything is right. Then it can 
make the things that initiate a new round. And after that it finishes. Our eukaryotic 
cells with a lot more DNA use the same thing. The same idea, but there tend to be 
multip le origins. And you get a little bubble and another little one down here. 

And once you get the replication forks estab lished then these kind of merge. And 
then eventually we end up with the two strands of DNA. But I just mention that in 
passing because it's an examp le of how even though the DNA is nothing but Gs and 
Cs and As and Ts, you can kind of write words in there that mean different things. 
Some of them on the genetic code tell you what the order of amino acids in the cell 
are, but everything else has to be encoded in the DNA, too. 

And here's a really nice examp le of how that works. Now, we're going to sw itch at 
this point from worrying about how DNA is rep licated to how information is stored 
and interpreted. And there's a figure that most of you have probably seen, DNA goes 
to RNA goes to protein. This is the usual direction of information flow. The 
information for making proteins is encoded in the DNA, as we'll ta lk about in more 
deta il, and an RNA copy of some piece of that, one gene's worth usua lly, gets made 
in RNA. 

And then that information  in the RNA is used to direct the sequences of amino acids 
that appear in a protein. And this is a four letter alphabet, if you want, A, G, T and C. 
This is a four letter a lphabet, A, G, U and C, where the uracil and the thymine have 
the same base pa iring capacity. And this is a 20 letter a lphabet. All those 20 amino 
acids that you were looking at, at the chart over at the back of the exam. So  from 
the point of view of  information storage and information flow there are some 
interesting things that had to come up in order for the information to flow in that 
way. 

But before I do that I want to just get you to think about DNA as an  information 
storage device. This is MIT. I'm a lmost sure in this room there are some people that 
are experts in high density information storage. And even if you're not most of us 
have now a lot of experience with it. Your computer can do gigabytes of information. 
Your iPod probab ly has a 40 megabyte hard drive in it or something like that. 

So you have some experience with high density information storage. So here's the 
question. How much DNA would it take to encode everybody who 's alive on earth 
today, 6 b illion and a bit peop le? And let's argue that all we need is a sing le cell's 

worth of DNA because everybody started out a single fertilized egg and went on. 
Yeah? OK. 

Enough DNA to  fill one human being. Anybody else got any sense? All right. This is, I 
think, the most amaz ing demo. I d id this when I was teaching for the first time. The 
amount of DNA it would take to encode everybody who's alive on earth, one cell of 
everybody who's alive on earth today is this little thing in here, which you probab ly 
cannot see even, but I took a picture of it. There are about six times ten to the 
minus twelfth grams of DNA in a human cell. 

And if you multip le that out by 6 billion peop le it comes out to 36 milligrams of DNA. 
And I weighed out 40 something milligrams of DNA. So there's actua lly more DNA 
there than you need to encode everybody who's alive on earth today. And I don't 
know how this hits you, but I've been working on DNA my entire life. And every time 
I do this, you know, I think I understand this molecule, but I don't really think I do 
at some more fundamental level. 

It's absolutely amazing how much information is stored in that molecule. So the one 
point I w ill, actually, I think it's close enough. Why don't we just ca ll it a day, and I'll 
pick this stuff --
