Transcript â€“ Lecture 30 

So, let's start with where we were. We were ta lking about exponentia l growth in 
populations. And, we said we could describe this as one over the dN/dt equals some 
growth rate, r. And, in this case, we're ta lking about, let me ask that is a question. 
As a model for population growth, what's wrong with this? What does this project? 
This is N. This is time. There's no stopping it. I mean, we'd be knee deep in 
everything if populations grew accord ing to this model, OK, because it just goes off 
into  infinity in terms of density. So, we know that this is inadequate. In  fact, some 
people describe the entire field of population ecology as a field that tries to 
determine why real populations can't grow according to this model. In other words, 
the whole field is trying to understand what the mechanisms are in populations that 
limit their growth. 

So, they don't grow exponentia lly forever. So, in this case, this is rea lly a maximum 
growth rate. We can ca ll that r Max. And in this case, it's a constant. So, when we're 
talking about exponential growth, the growth rate per unit time  is the maximum 
growth rate that that population  is capable of under those conditions and it's a 
constant. So, if we want to plot it this way, one over N, dN/dt, as a function of N, is 
constant. It doesn't change as density changes. 

So, now we're going to take a historical look at this. Back in the 1920s, two fellows 
named Pearl and Reed wanted to model human population growth. And they looked 
at this exponential growth equation, and they sa id there's got to be something wrong 
with that. We can't just app ly that to humans, a lthough if they plotted as a  function 
of time, and this  is humans in the US from 1800 to 1900, and this is the human 
population size, if they p lotted this on this curve, they got something that looked like 
this. So, it kind of looked like exponential growth. 

But, when they went in  it actua lly looked at one over ND, dN/dt, which would be the 
slope along here,  they found that  it looks something like this. In other words, the 
actual growth rate of the population was decreasing as the number of humans 
increased. And this is called a density dependent response. OK, so if we look at this, 
remember from last time that r is equal to the b irth rate minus the death rate, right? 
So, we can look at, this is just a simple cartoon drawing of what's going on here. 
Density dependent factors regulate population size. So,  if we p lot one over ND, dN/dt 
as either a b irth rate or a death rate, as a  function of population density, when you 
have density, rea lly the one that's the most important here is  looking at this one, 
that death rate increases as population increases, and b irth rate decreases. 

And you have an intersection here where birth rate and death rate are equa l, and 
your population's going to stabilize there where there will be no change in population 
growth. And these density dependent birth rates and death rates introduce a 
stab iliz ing factor. 

As N increases, r decreases in the population. And that's what brings population back 
into some sort of equilibrium. OK, so all right, forget that. So, let's go back over to 
Pearl and Reed. We're going to stay on the board for awhile. So the question is, how 

do we mod ify that equation, our simple exponential growth equation, so that it more 
realistically describes real populations that can't grow totally unconstrained? So what 
Pearl and Reed did, how do we modify the exponentia l growth? So, here's what we 
want the characteristics to be of this equation. 

We want one over N, dN/dt, to go to zero as N gets large. And we want it to go to 
our max, the maximum growth rate, when N approaches zero. In other words, at 
really, really low population density is, you can effectively have exponentia l growth 
because nothing's limiting you. When the density gets very, very  large, you want this 
growth rate to go to zero. 

So, they came up, so let's p lot this N. This is T, and here's our exponentia l growth 
equation. And they came up with a  function that looks like this. So, this would be 
one over N, and to describe this, we have this equation. And this is ca lled the log istic 
equation for reasons that are historica lly obscure. This is a French term that has 
something to do with, anybody know, who speaks French? It has to do with 
something military. Anyway, I've never been able to figure out why they call this the 
logistic equation. But it doesn't matter what it's called, this is what it is. 

And K here is the carrying capacity of the environment. It's the maximum number of 
organisms were the population levels off, OK? All right, so let's look at this. Let's 
replot this, because  it's easier to ana lyze the features. We're going to p lot one over 
N, dN/dt as a  function of N. If we want to rewrite the equation, one over N, dN/dt 
equa ls our max. We're just rearrang ing that equation to make it easier to visua lize. 

OK? So that we have a line that we can put that on, such that K is the X intercept, 
and what's this? Our max, exactly. So, you can see these features over here at this 
plot, right? So, as this goes to zero, or as N is very large, one over N, dN/dt goes to 
zero. And, when N is very small, one over N, dN/dt is near our max. You're basically 
grow ing. You're over here where the exponentia l growth curve and the logistica l 
curve are essentially the same thing. Yeah? Do I have something wrong? Oh, very 
good, very good, very good. 

Thank you. Absolutely right. OK, so the slope here is going to be minus r max over 
K. . OK, so here we have a nice density dependent response. OK,  let's analyze some 
more features of this. Just looking at the exponentia l and the log istic, just to 
summarize, one over N, dN/dt as a function of N, and if we just look at the dN/dt as 
a function of N, for exponential we already said  that this is a  flat line, right? It's a 
constant, but the actua l change in numbers as a function of time is a straight line, 
whereas for the logistic, one over N, dN/dt as a function of N, what does this look 
like? We just did it, so we are summariz ing here. 

But here's one that I want you to think about. What does the dN/dt look like as a 
function of N if something's growing according  to the logistic equation? L ike this? 
Yes, there you go, like that. Right. Because there is an inflection point here, right? 
So, this  is what's sometimes called the optimum yield, and believe it or not, this 
model is actually used in  fisheries conservation  for years. Now we know that  it's so 
much more comp licated than that that you can't just set the model is. 

But one could argue that if you are managing a population that you want to harvest, 
that you try to keep them at the density at which the dN/dt, the production of 
organisms, is maximal. So, you try to maintain a population there at that point. One 
of the features of the logistic equation is that it assumes instantaneous feedback of 

the density on growth rate. In other words, it says in a population of a certa in 
density,  the results in terms of offspring will be instantaneous. 

And we know that's not true. So, this is an oversimplification. Even in the simplest 
organisms, even microbes in a culture, say you suddenly starve them up some 
substrate that they're using. It takes a while for their b iochemistry to readjust before 
that. They might have one generation that's still at the same growth rate as it was 
before, before the b iochemistry readjusts and says, whoa, we can't keep going at 
this rate. Slow down. And then  for higher organisms, you might have a whole 
generation before that sets it in. P lants that make seeds, etc. So we know that 
there's a prob lem here. 

So, people have tried to introduce time lags into the equation, and we don't have 
time. I mean there's lots of really neat things that you can do with this. If this was 
an advanced ecology course, you'd be modeling it on your computer, and putting 
time lags in, and see what happens and all that kind of stuff. So we don't have time 
to do any of that. I show you this more as a way, I want you to learn how population 
ethologists think, not that this is actually the most important model that ever 
existed. 

So how do we introduce time lags into the logistic? Well, the simplest way is to 
introduce time. So, we're going to say dNt/dt. Let me just make sure that's not 
ambiguous. dNt/dT, is equa l to r max times N at that time t times K minus Nt minus 
tao. In other words, the density at some time, tao hours or days or whatever, earlier 
than t, divided by K. 

So, what this says is that the growth rate of the population is a function of the 
density up a little b it earlier, or some amount earlier than the time at which we're 
measuring the growth rate. So t or tao is the time lag between sensing 
environments, and change in growth rate. So let's look at what that means in terms 
of, this brings us to another level of complexity. So let's look at the possib ilities here. 
So, with no lag, we have our logistic equation, right? The population just reaches the 
carrying capacity and levels off. With a very short lag, and of course you have to 
play with this to understand what I mean by short, long, and med ium because you 
have to change all the d ifferent parameters. 

But if you have a short lag, what you get is an actual overshoot of the carrying 
capacity in the near term because the feedback hasn't kicked in. But then, it w ill 
come back and it will level off at the carrying capacity. If you have a med ium lag, 
you will often see something like this where you get a couple of oscillations in here. 
But it levels off at the same carrying capacity. And, a long lag, you can end up w ith 
behavior that ultimately ends up in the population crashing. 

And we don't have time to analyze this, but at the end of the lecture I'm going to 
come back to why this is so important in terms of human population growth. And for 
those of you who are interested in complex systems and chaos theory, the log istic 
equation in its discrete form actually will go chaotic for certain parameter va lues. 
And for a long time,  for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, just 
ignore me. And  for those who are  interested ought to spend a minute on it. For a 
long time, this equation goes into a state of sort of chaotic oscillations, but that can 
be described mathematica lly. 

And for a long time, ecologists kept looking at populations trying to see whether, 
indeed,  they were grow ing accord ing to this chaos theory and it hasn't rea lly 
developed to anything, but it was interesting. Chaos theory first started coming to 
light; the sea collision was one of the first that people started looking into, 
coincidenta lly. But just because an equation has certa in properties, it doesn't mean 
that thing it's trying to model has those properties. 

So that was a really interesting development. OK, so let's go back to Pearl and Reed. 
Where did they go? Oh, they're up there. OK, so this was all a digression. So Pearl 
and Reed were looking at the human population data, and trying  to model  it. And 
they showed that they had this density dependent response. They developed this 
equation in order to describe it. And then, they looked at the data again using this 
graphica l formulation. So, let's look at that. 

We're just going to use the graphic method, because it's easier to illustrate. And 
now, we're looking at the human population in the US, and this is one over N, dN/dt, 
and this is N  in millions. And so, they have some data points that they put on here. 
This is 1800 to 1810. So, they have d ifferent data points for d ifferent interva ls, and 
their last point here was 1900 to 1910, an average of the population size. And so, 
they projected down here there were 100 million people then. 

So, they sa id, so they asked the question: OK, we're modeling this population, we're 
saying it grows accord ing to the logistic equation, we can predict what the carrying 
capacity in the United States for humans by simply doing a  regression through this, 
and seeing where it intercepts. So, that should be the carrying capacity. And they 
predicted that we'd have 197 million when we reach the carrying capacity. And that 
was in the year 2030. 

So that was a prediction of their model back in the 1920s, that the carrying capacity 
of the US for humans was 197 million, and that that would be reached in 2030. Well, 
they missed it by a  lot. So, let's look at the data, which is not surprising. Here's 
1965. We reached 200 million way before 2030. 1990, 250 million, and actually 
today, at 10:45 this morning, because I looked  it up on my trusty population clock 
on the Web, we had 295,979,238 peop le. 

This is also done by modeling, we're not counting people one at a time. But this 
website is keeping track based on various models. And, based on the models that we 
have today, in 2030 we should have about 345 million. But these models are based 
on something entirely much more comp lex now than the simple log istic equation. 
OK, so  the contribution of Pearl and Reed was to be yet to get people to start 
thinking about the feedback mechanisms, how  to model population growth, and think 
about the feedback mechanisms in that model. You don't have that  in your handout, 
but it's not important. 

It's not on the web, but if you care about  it, there is the website that keeps track of 
human population in the US. So, here's the tota l population number that I got this 
morning at 10:14 and 17 seconds off the web. And these are just some interesting 
statistics for the US, and I have them for the last three years: one birth every eight 
seconds, one death every 13 seconds, one migrant every 26 seconds, and a net gain 
of one person every 12 seconds. So they're keeping close track here. OK, a ll right, so 
now are going to move on to g lobal population growth, humans on the earth, the 
whole shoot and match. 

And, there's this wonderful book for anyone who 's interested by Joel Cohen, called, 
How Many Peop le Can the Earth Support? And, it's a great book for MIT students 
because it's a wonderfully nerdy account. I'm a nerd, so I can say that. I'm a total 
nerd. But it's just a wonderful account, analysis, if you analyze human population 
growth, and at the same time looking at the phenomenon in a totally ob jective way. 
He's a theoretica l ecologist. So, this is in your textbook. But, it's from this book. And, 
it's from 10,000 B.C. up to here we are today, the population on Earth in b illions. 
And, this is back in the hunter gatherer era. 

We had 4 million peop le. And this was a small revolution at the time, the introduction 
of the agriculture and domestication of anima ls allowed for higher b irth rates, and so 
had a little b lip, went up to 7 million here. And then for a long time, there was just 
no change in human population on Earth. And so then, here you start to get, I'm not 
sure what started this up rise. Maybe when we see the next slide we'll see. No, I'm 
not sure what started that. We'll have to look into that. Maybe just the accumulation 
of people that you can't see on this scale, here's the bubonic plague, a decrease. 
Here's the beg inning of the Industria l Revolution and the introduction of modern 
med icine, which greatly reduced morta lity. 

So, you see this incred ible, and here's fossil fuel, increase  in the population of 
humans on Earth. So, if you look at this curve, you think, oh my God, we're  in the 
middle of this incredib le exponentia l increase. And, the reality is this doesn't fit at all 
in an exponential model at a ll. I mean, if you tried to fit that to our simple 
exponentia l, it does not fit. We are going to explain what's happening here in a 
minute. So here we are at 6 billion people. And we hit 6 billion in 1999. And here we 
are w ith a steady  increase. I've just got the last three years. This marks the lectures 
that I've given in this class. Every year I check in and see where we are. 

It's kind of a living document. And, we're now projected to reach 9 billion and level 
off. When I first started teaching about human population growth, the projections 
were at 12 billion. And I'm not that old. This number keeps changing, and luckily it's 
chang ing in the right direction. We keep pred icting fewer and fewer humans before it 
will level off. But it's still 3 billion more humans than we have now, and many people 
think now were a lready beyond the carrying capacity of the Earth. 

So, I'm not saying not to worry, I'm just saying  that at least it's going in the right 
direction. So, in Cohen's book, he analyzes this, sort of the history of humans on 
Earth as having four major evolutionary changes where you have the dramatic 
change in population growth. You have local agriculture in 8000 B.C. And, the 
doubling time of the population before and after those evolutions went from what he 
estimates to be 40,000 to 300,000 years for a population to doub le down to 1000 to 
3000 years for the population to double. 

In other words, this is an incredib ly faster growth rate, because this is doubling 
times. And then, with global agriculture in the 1700s, again you have a shortening of 
the doubling time of the population. And then in the 50s w ith the introduction of real 
public health across the world, another reduction, and luckily in the 70s, with the 
introduction of fertility control, at least in the developed countries, is the first time 
you actua lly see a shift. We've gone from growing faster, and faster, and faster to 
actually growing more slowly. 

The doubling time is extending. So, the good news is we're not in some kind of 
runaway population growth that's going to continue forever. We've a lready peaked 

out as a globe, and we are going to level off in terms humans. And the real big 
question is when we level off, will we be above the carrying capacity of the Earth? 
Have we overshot K? And we don't know yet because these feedback mechanisms 
haven't come back. So,  let's now ana lyze this a little b it more before we look at it in 
that context, because this is an important thing. First of a ll, before we do that, I 
want to remind you that a ll of these  lectures are tied together because remember 
this from lecture 20 when we were ta lking about biogeochemical cycles? And, here's 
the same population size and billions on Earth, the brown curve. 

It's smoothed over, and these are the greenhouse gases, concentration of 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This is the human  footprint. This  is how we've 
changed the metabolism of the Earth, by this explosive growth of humans. 

And one more slide just showing you that this is another way to  look at it, showing 
that the growth of the g loba l population has peaked. So, over here, each of these is 
the population in billions, and it basically shows you the number of years necessary 
to add a billion. And you could see that it's taking longer and longer to add a billion. 
You can see that there is an inflection point here. So, using the tools that we've 
developed to ana lyze populations, let's look at why this growth is leveling off. What 
caused the growth to beg in with, and why it's leveling off? And the really important 
feature here is what's called a demographic transition. 

This is what we are going through on the Earth right now in terms of human 
population growth. And, the way we look at this, we are p lanning birth rates here, 
which is the pink one, and death rate here, which is the green one. And, when birth 
rates and death rates are both uniformly high, which is the way it was back in the 
early days when we d idn't have fertility control, and we didn't have modern 
med icine. So, you had a lot of bab ies and a lot of peop le dying. 

And growth rate, and so this is the tota l population. So, you don't have much 
population growth. Then, what happens, you get to a place where you have a very 
high birth rate. Birth rate continues to stay high, but w ith the introduction of public 
hea lth, and modern medicine, we were ab le to keep peop le a live a lot longer. And, 
that came in advance of fertility control. So, what happens, when these two curves 
deviate from one another, you have explosive growth, and that's what this big 
exponentia l shoot is. But then, if you then reduce the birth rates through fertility 
control to match the death rates, you then have low birth rates and low death rates. 

Then you have no population growth, OK? So, it's very simple and intuitive when you 
understand what's going on, but I don't think that most people rea lly have come to 
the point of thinking about it like that. And where we are on Earth today  is the 
developed countries have gone through their demographic transition. And you have a 
sense of that just from looking at family size in these countries. So, if we look at, 
this is Sweden as an example of a developed country. And this was 1800. 

And this is 2000. You see something like this. This  is just an approximation. This is 
the b irth rate and this is the death rate, and the population growth rate looks 
something like this. The populations leveled off whereas if you look at a country like 
Egypt over the same time frame, and you can get these curves off the web easily, it 
looks something like this. You have a high birth rate. And death rate has gone down, 
but they're not matching each other at a ll. 

So, population look something like this. It hasn't even begun to level off. So the real 
trick is, in terms of trying to level off at somep lace lower than 9 b illion, is to get the 
birthrates in the developing countries to drop as fast as we can. And that w ill 
determine the level at which humans w ill level off on Earth. So, let's just briefly, let 
me go back over here, and let's go back over this carrying capacity. And this is 
basically what Joel Cohen's book is about, where he says, how many people can the 
Earth support? He's asking, what's the carrying capacity of the earth for humans? 
And here are the possib ilities. 

And of course, I'm simplifying the most complex system  that we know into a simple 
two-dimensional graph, but I think it's a good way to think about it. Here's the way 
we've been living on Earth. We have been growing like this. Granted, we're starting 
to level off, but we've been growing like this. And what we've been assuming, is that 
the carrying capacity w ill grow with us, OK? We can hand le as many humans as we 
want to put because we, smart peop le, w ith technology can increase the carrying 
capacity. If we don't have enough grain, we'll genetically engineer to make more 
grain. 

We can fix it; we can fix it, so  let's just go with the flow. And indeed, technology has 
greatly increased the carrying capacity of the earth for humans. There's no doubt 
about it. But there's got to be a limit. So, is this the model that we want to go by? 
So, some people argue, so, the climate, we'll fix that with technology. We can  fix any 
of this w ith technology, and if things get rea lly bad, we'll go to Mars; we'll terraform 
Mars. 

We'll colonize planets. That's not that far-fetched, so why should we worry about a ll 
these humans on the Earth? We'll just figure out, we'll go out and  find new places. 
So that's one model. Another model is, if we're going to do this, here's what I ca ll 
the optimistic model. Well, I guess this is the super optimistic model. 

This one assumes that it'll do something like this that we may overshoot. And then 
birth rates, and if you want to you can easily describe a scenario that says that we 
have overshot, that this whole environmenta l movement, the measurement of toxins 
in our environment,  the g lobal change, a ll of that is rea lly overshooting the carrying 
capacity. And we wouldn't be worrying about things that we're worrying about if we 
hadn't overshot it, but that if we get our act together, we won't have eroded the 
Earth's natura l system so much that we can come back to a stab le level. 

And then, of course, the pessimistic scenario is that, indeed, we've overshot, and 
we've overshot so much that we have eroded the carrying capacity, and that we will 
level off at some  level that the Earth will no longer be able to support the level of 
humans that it can even support now, that we have  lost so much topsoil, and 
modern agriculture won't be able to overcome that, that our water w ill be polluted, 
that the climate w ill change so dramatically, the fisheries w ill be eliminated, yada, 
yada, yada. I shouldn't say yada, yada, yada. 

Those are catastrophic things. Erase that from the tape! Every once in a while, I 
remember I'm being taped. So, those are bad things, not to be yada, yada, yada'd. 
So, anyway, this is what some people are worried about, that we are, indeed right 
now, in your lifetime and in fact mostly in your lifetime, you are inheriting this, 
notice the time frames on this graph. I mean, this is just this little snippet of time in 
the history of  life on Earth where a ll these dramatic things are happening. And we 

just happen to be living in it. Just think if you're living back here, and thousands and 
thousands of years went by, and nothing changed. 

OK, so we don't have any answers, but this is a way to think about it, and a lot of 
people are putting a lot of energy into modeling the systems, and try to figure out 
where we are the scariest trajectories. So, the next two lectures Professor Martin 
Polz, who is a professor in civil and environmental eng ineering, and the 
microbiolog ist is going to come in and talk to you about, again, its population 
economy. He'll talk to you about population genetics, and some rea lly exciting work 
that's going on in the field now using genomics to decipher evolution and population 
biology. 

And then I'll be back with some rea lly neat DVD clips. So, come back.
