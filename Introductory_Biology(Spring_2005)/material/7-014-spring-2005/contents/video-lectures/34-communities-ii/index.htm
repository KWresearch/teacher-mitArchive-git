<p></p>
<p>OK, so the last lecture we were talking about competition, and the  result of competition between organisms. And I didn't quite finish, so I  just want to finish up on that lecture, and then will move on to  predation, an interaction between two species which results in  increasing the fitness and one, and decreasing the fitness in the other.  But let's just finish up with competition. We were talking about  character displacement and beak depths. And we have shown that when you  have two closely related birds with the same beak size, if they live on  islands separate from one another, they compete for the same food. But  if you live on an island together, what happens is that you have this  character displacement where the beak of what will get bigger and the  beak of the other will get smaller. So they can exploit different food  resources.</p>
<p>And this character displacement is the beginning of  species formation. And this is very common on islands. And these are the  famous finches from the Galapagos Islands that Darwin first based his  theory of evolution, or it was an important part of his theory of  evolution, where he realized that there must have been an ancestor  finch, that all of these other finches that had different representation  on different islands evolved from through the slow change in traits  that is selected as a result of different combination of species being  together or alone in different islands. And this is what's called  adaptive radiation. And this is really a powerful mechanism for  evolution.</p>
<p>This is the Galapagos finches, but you also see this in  an extreme form in Hawaii among the honey creepers showing this  incredible diversity of beak types that have evolved to exploit  different kinds of food. OK, so before we go on to predation, I just  want to walk you through an evolutionary scenario, so that you can see  how this might work on an island, Archipelago. So this is the mainland,  and we're going to start with an ancestor species, A, and our  Archipelago is going to have three islands. OK, let me draw this.</p>
<p>Here's  the same three islands. So this is time passing. So as we move, these  are the same three islands as a function of time passing, OK? So at the  beginning, we're going to have our founder species flying and colonizing  the island. OK, so A is on this island. And so, the first thing that  happens is that A evolves and becomes B. So each one of these is just  the name of the species, OK? This is species A, species B, through  what's known as the founder effect. And that is when you have a few  members of the species colonizing on this island. You have a tiny gene  pool, and the genetic composition of this drifts such that it actually  becomes a different species from the one on the mainland. So, A becomes  B.</p>
<p>So the full arrow means becomes B on the islands through the  founder effect. And now, we're going to have B migrate to a new island.  So, A is now B on this island, right? And B is going to colonize this  island. And through that same founder effect, B becomes C. So let me  just write what's happening here. B becomes C. I think you can see  what's happening on one island, and then it migrates back. So, let's let  C migrate back to where B is, and C also founds a new island.</p>
<p>So,  we're going to let C migrate here. So we end up with C and B here now  able to compete with each other, C here and C here. OK, so we've got a  new combination of species, and we are going to let C become D here due  to the founder effect, and D is going to migrate over to this island.  So, C becomes E when with B because of character displacement. So, C  becomes E here when it's with B.</p>
<p>So you end up with E and B on  this island. D is going to migrate to this island. So, we have C and D  here. And, C has evolved to be D here. So, we also have C becomes D when  alone. OK, so this is just a scenario we are making up. OK, you can  make up any scenario. But it's to give you the idea of how this adaptive  radiation comes about. So, starting with one single species on the  mainland, if you have an island archipelago where species can be  isolated enough from each other to restrict, but not completely  eliminate, the gene flow you can have this rapid adaptive radiation. So,  evolutionary biologists often study islands in order to study this  phenomenon.</p>
<p>OK, so just to summarize for competition,  interspecific competition results in either competitive coexistence,  which can be achieved either through niche differentiation. Do you  remember, what was an example of that last time? The barnacles and the  inner tidal. One took the high road, and one took the low road. That's  called niche differentiation, or character displacement. And this can  happen very rapidly.</p>
<p>I hesitate to tell you about really  interesting things that you don't have to know, but I will anyway. This  is really interesting study by a couple at Princeton of the Galapagos  finches. And they've shown that you can have character displacement of  the islands over a period of one or two years, just depending on the  amount of rainfall. So, it can happen very rapidly by just selecting for  different character traits, or competitive exclusion, which is the case  where the niche overlap is so great that one of the species completely  outcompete the other. The example from last time was the zebra mussels  and Gause's paramecia in the test tubes excluding the other.</p>
<p>So,  these are really important ecological and evolutionary forces. The other  thing I learned from your comments, which I was very heartened by, is  that at least one person really liked the definition of the niche, of  the N-dimensional hyper volume, which I have always loved and I think is  fundamentally important because people throw around ecological niche in  everyday language and think of it as a place in the environment. And I  think that a more robust definition is so much more useful.</p>
<p>So,  let's move onto predation, which is a very strong evolutionary force. It  can control population dynamics. It can shape community structure.  We're going to talk about each of these. It actually influences  competition, which in turn shapes community structure. And it's a  powerful evolutionary agent. In other words, it's very important in  influencing naturally selection. So, let's start with the classic,  here's a classic predator-prey interaction. There is two wolves and a  moose being attacked. The wolves are not evil. They're just getting  their meal. OK, this is a very famous classic study of the snowshoe  hare, and lynx.</p>
<p>Lynx is a cat: populations in northern Canada. And  these data were collected by the Hudson Bay Company trapping records.  So, it's really from the amount of animals that were actually trapped  that these abundances come from. And that's where these coupled  oscillations, this is the hare, and this is the lynx showing these  couples oscillations with a roughly 11 year cycle. And people spend a  lot of time trying to understand what was driving that oscillation.</p>
<p>And  mathematicians love these coupled oscillators. And so, the first  attempt to model this kind of thing was using a very simple model.  Remember we said the dN/dt equals rN? That's our exponential growth  equation. And we also said before the dN/dt or that r is equal to the  birthrate (b) minus the death rate (d). OK, so grossly oversimplifying  the system, the first set of equations that were used to try to describe  this, are if you use for the predator, you call the predator dN1/DT  equals b1,N1 minus d1,N1.</p>
<p>OK, so that's just this equation. And  they said, well, how do we modify this equation so that the growth rate  of the predator is somehow a function of the density of the prey? Well,  the easiest thing to do is just make it proportional, right? So what  they do is put N2 in there. So, the prey population is going to be  dN2/dt, and we're going to the same thing: b2,N2 minus d2,N2, and the  question is how do we modify the prey growth rate equation so that it is  somehow a function of the density of the predator? So what would you  do? So here, this says the birthrate of the predator is influenced.</p>
<p>As  prey density increases, the birthrate of the predator increases. How  would you modify this equation so that the predator density has an  effect on it? It's pretty obvious, but I'm trying to get you with me.  Exactly. It would be the death term. As the predator numbers increase,  the death term would go up. And it turns out that these are two coupled  differential equations that make a beautiful oscillatory system, a  couple oscillators, perfect oscillators like that.</p>
<p>This is  predator density. So that would be N1, N2, and this is time if you chart  their density with time. And how many of you have actually had this in  the course? Yeah, see? [LAUGHTER] And what courses have you had in it?  Differential equations, yeah. Mathematicians love it. But real  populations, predator and prey, don't really operate this way. I mean,  you see these oscillations, but rarely can it be attributed solely to  the interaction between the predator and the prey.</p>
<p>There's usually  many other factors. So, and I'll just give you one example. So  ecologists go ahead and say, OK, so what's really going on? And here's  an example. It turns out that in many cases, the food supply of the prey  is oscillating. OK, so the availability of food to the prey oscillates,  making the prey population oscillate, which then can drive an  oscillation in the predator population. So, it's more than just the  coupling between the two. There are also an external oscillators driving  both of them. And again, I'd like to try to address the role of  experimentation. Here is an experiment done with rabbits.</p>
<p>And I  don't know what the predator was. It might have been, I'm not sure the  predator was, but anyway, rabbits, in which through experimentation they  increased the food supply to the rabbits through fertilization. And  they showed that, so this is the control. And this is the phase of the  cycle in the hare population relative to the density in the controls.  So, showing that when the food supply was increased, the oscillation was  still there. So, it wasn't only relieving the rabbits of food  limitation, did not eliminate the oscillation, but if you'd excluded the  predators, you still also had the oscillation there. And if you did  both of them, it increased the amplitude of the oscillation, relative to  the control.</p>
<p>So the conclusion from this is that both food supply  and the predation affected the oscillation. Another very classic  experiment is the experiment by Huffaker back when people began to be  enamored of these coupled differential equations. People wanted to test  the hypothesis of those equations in the laboratory. And they tried to  set up predator-prey systems in the lab, and see if they can get them to  go in these coupled oscillations for many cycles. And Huffaker set up a  system of a predatory mite and a prey mite. Ecologists like to use  insects as experimental systems because they're small and you can do it  in the lab.</p>
<p>And this one lived on oranges. So it was an  herbivorous mite. And the predator obviously lived on mites. And he set  up a very simple system in the lab of oranges, and introduced the  predator and prey, and inevitably he got this, where prey would  increase, and then the predator would increase, and would overshoot, and  the prey would die, and the predator would die. So he only got one  cycle, with a simple system could not get this to persist, well, that  doesn't even qualify as a cycle.</p>
<p>So he realized, so this is a  simple system. And he had a grid, which is shown up here in which he had  oranges. And he had them interspersed with rubber balls to have a  little bit of complexity in the system. But he found with that design,  he could not get the system to persist. So he hypothesized that the  reason it wouldn't persist is that it's much too simple, not close  enough to nature. So he introduced all kinds of complexity.</p>
<p>He  increased the size of his grid relative to the populations, which would  give the prey mites more of a chance to get away from the predator. He  put barriers of dispersal, like Vaseline moats, and he actually put  little launching pads for the prey. I don't know what they look like,  diving boards, I don't know what they were, but little launching pads  that just increased a lot of complexity so that it gave the prey an  ability to move around relative to the predator. And he was actually  able to, this shows his results over 200 days.</p>
<p>He was actually  able to get three full cycles of the predator-prey oscillation. And up  here, it just shows you that they're sort of a cat and mouse game going  on. It shows you the location of the prey mites relative to the predator  mites at these different points in time of this cycle, showing that  they're moving around the system, and that the complexity allowed this  coupled oscillator to persist. And of course, we present this because it  was a classic experiment. It was a pioneering experiment, but I mean,  there have been a lot more since then. And of course, it has  implications for stability of populations in the natural world.</p>
<p>As  we make the natural world less and less complex, it reduces the ability  of populations that are engaged in these coupled oscillatory systems to  persist. It increases the likelihood of extinction. So this was like a  tiny little localized extinction in his experimental system. Another  classic example that's often cited about the role of predation in  regulating population dynamics has to do with rubber plantations over  here in Malaysia. Did I spell that right? That looks wrong.</p>
<p>Oh  well, is that OK? And I don't have any data for you. So this is just a  story, but it's very compelling, and there is data somewhere but I don't  have a slide. But, in the first half of the century, in its rubber  plantations in Malaysia they had a tremendous diversity of insects, but  didn't have any real serious problems with insect pests in the rubber  plantations. And, in 1950, they had a small outbreak of defoliated  caterpillars.</p>
<p>And that was right about the time that DDT was  invented and synthesized, and became available. And so, entomologists  came down and sprayed the plantation with DDT hoping to get rid of this  caterpillar. In the next year, the outbreak got bigger. They sprayed  more. The next year the outbreak got bigger. They sprayed more, and  finally the whole thing was out of control. And they said what's going  on here? We are killing these things, and it's getting bigger. To make a  long story short, what they were doing, this is a cocoon. Oh boy.</p>
<p>How  do you spell cocoon? That's not right. Is that right? Anyway, you know  what I mean. Caterpillars live in cocoons, and there was a, that's a  wasp with a big, long organ that it lays its eggs. It needs some legs,  doesn't it? OK, I made some front legs too. There. OK, so that's a wasp  that lays its eggs in these caterpillar cocoons, and in doing so, kills  caterpillars. And what they were doing with the DDT, is that they were  killing the natural predator of the wasp. And the caterpillars  themselves, while they were in the cocoon, were actually protected from  the DDT. So the more they put on, the more they killed the wasp, and the  caterpillars were released from this controlling predation, and they  had huge outbreaks.</p>
<p>So, it's another example of in nature it's  really hard, you can't see what's controlling what until you disrupt it.  You have to experiment either inadvertently or on purpose because  everything is dynamic and turning over. But it looks relatively stable.  And that's why this is so hard. And this is one of my favorite examples  of this, because it brings together a lot of concepts that we've been  talking about, is predation shapes community structure. And this is  another example of introduced species.</p>
<p>And this is St. John's  Wort, which was introduced at California from Europe. And, it, so I'm  going to draw a couple of habitats here. This is a forest, and this is a  meadow. So this is grass, OK, this is trees. And these are St. John's  Wort. So, it could grow equally well in the meadow and in the forest.  And it was getting out of control so they introduced a beetle from  Europe that feeds on St. John's Wort to try to bring it in to under  control. And what they found was that the beetle, because the beetle's  preferred habitat was the meadow that St.</p>
<p>John's Wort persisted in  the forests but was eliminated from the meadow. Now, because the beetle  prefers the sunny habitat of the meadow, so if you were an ecologist  and you didn't know that this beetle had been introduced, you just  walked into this state, you knew nothing about the history, you wanted  to study the ecological niche of St. John's Wort, you would say, well, I  only find it in the forest. It must like cooler, wetter environments  because you wouldn't really know that it was being controlled by the  presence of this beetle.</p>
<p>So, this is a perfect example. If we draw  the niche or two dimensions of the ecological niche of St. John's Wort,  and we say that just on these two dimensions that this is the  fundamental niche on the moisture light gradient, in the presence of  this beetle, the realized niche is only this low light, high moisture  environment that you find in the forest. OK, so in other words, to  really understand what's regulating the ecology of a particular  organism, you have to understand all of the other organisms that it's  interacting with, and what their effect is on this. And again, that's  why it's so impossible to do this without some form of experiment,  either manipulative experiments like I described, or experiments done in  a lab, or inadvertent experiments by introducing species.</p>
<p>OK, now  let's talk about a couple of other really classic experiments that have  been done. And these are experiments that have illustrated the concept  of keystone predator. There are some predators and ecosystems that are  what are called keystones. And that is if you remove them, the entire  structure of the community changes. There are some that if you move  them, it doesn't have a dramatic effect, but there are certain ones that  are keystone predators that it does. And these, of course, are species  that conservation biologists want to first identify, and second conserve  above others because there is a cascade of effects if something happens  to them.</p>
<p>A classic example of this was a study by Robert Payne  many years ago in the inner tidal community. I'm not going to go into  the details of that, but the rocky inner tidal community is made up of  the starfish, which is called pisaster, one of the top predators. And  there are also limpets, chitins, if you grew up in California you know  probably what these are, mussels.</p>
<p>These are invertebrates-like  barnacles that stick to the ground, or stick to the rocks, and also  algae that stick to the rocks. And Payne hypothesized that the predator  was maintaining this diversity. And the way to test that hypothesis was  to put a cage over everything and eliminate the predator from certain  areas. At what he showed was that that's what that ecosystem looks like  if you eliminate the predator. You can see here, here's the algae. Here  are some articles.</p>
<p>This is a new textbook, see if you get the full  story there, but there's a lot of diversity of the small barnacle-like  invertebrates. Then you eliminate the predator, and the mussels just  completely take over. And this is preemptive competition. They compete  with everything else for space and nothing else can survive there.  Another example of a keystone predator is the sea otter, which keeps the  sea urchins in check in the bottom of the substrate, and if the sea  otter is not there the sea urchins takeover and they exclude the kelp,  the entire kelp forests and all the fishes that lives in the kelp  forests, and all of the diversity of the ecosystem relies on the sea  otter's ability to keep the sea urchin population in check. OK, so some  of the best evidence for predation as an evolutionary agent, or  something that's driving the natural selection of organisms, are these  defenses that have evolved to avoid predation.</p>
<p>In other words, if  you're constantly under attack, your fitness will be increased by  features that reduce your susceptibility to predation. So in this case,  there are a lot of experiments. I'm going to show you a few, but a  picture's worth a thousand words here. I'll show you some examples.  Cryptic coloration is when a prey organism has color features that make  it blend in to the environment.</p>
<p>So here's a very famous example  that was actually in another inadvertent experiment. This is a moth that  comes in two forms. This is called the melanic form, which is dark  black or gray, and this is the other form which is much lighter. And  here it is on a birch tree. You can see that this one blends it  beautifully, whereas this one, if I were a predator looking for the  moth, I would see this but I wouldn't see that. Here's the same two  moths on another tree with darker bark showing that in this case, this  one would be more fit in that one would be less fit. And there's a very  famous study that I don't have time to go into, but it's a textbook,  that showed experimentally the relative fitness between these two forms,  depending on the color of the tree trunks. And this whole example is  called industrial melanism because the reason this was noticed was that  in areas of high industrialization the tree trunks are darker colored  because of the air pollution.</p>
<p>This is back in England back in the  days when there is a lot more air pollution. So, they were able to show a  shift in the frequency of these two forms as a function of the amount  of pollution and environment because their susceptibility to predation  was reduced if this form dominated. That study is actually rather  controversial now, so I won't teach you the details. But you get the  point. But these moths exist in these two forms.</p>
<p>Here's another  example that's really convoluted that's in your textbook. So I'm not  going to write it on the board. You can read about it there. But it's an  example of what's called the evolutionary arms race. And it has to do  with Cottonwood trees. And Cottonwood trees produce a defense compound  that the name of which is on the next slide: Soliccorten [SP?]. It  doesn't matter what it's called, it's a toxic compound that makes the  tree distasteful to predator. You don't think of predators of trees. The  beaver is a tree predator. It chops it down.</p>
<p>So when a beaver  chops it down, a Cottonwood tree, the Cottonwood tree sprouts new  sprouts. And the resprouts have much higher concentrations of this toxic  compound than the parent tree had. In other words, the tree has a  mechanism. And I'm sure we don't understand that yet, but someday we'll  understand the genetic underpinnings of this, the molecular biology of  beaver defenses. But if it's been felled by a beaver, it increases the  production of this toxin in the shoots that come out saying, OK, fool me  once, but you're not getting to get me the next time.</p>
<p>It means  there's beavers around. But the interesting thing is that these shoots  are much more susceptible to grazing by a leaf beetle. In other words,  this increased toxin, the shoots that have the increased toxin, are  actually grazed more than the parent tree by this leaf beetle. So  scientists went in and said, you know, what's going on here? This is  weird. Why make a defense that makes you more vulnerable to a different  predator? And what they showed by experiment was that these leaf beetles  were using that toxin as a defense against the ants that want to eat  them. So, they were less susceptible to predation by ants because they  had taken in the toxin from the shoots.</p>
<p>So, it's called the  evolutionary arms race between predator and prey. In these systems get  very complex. So here's the data that shows that, that the control  trees, trees that haven't been felled by a beaver compared to trees that  have been felled by a beaver, and resprouted trees have a much higher  concentration of this toxin. And this is the larval survival time of  these leaf beetles that these are from the control trees versus the  browsed trees in the presence of the ants. OK, I'm going to skip that  one.</p>
<p>That ones in your book, too, which has an experiment showing  that anti-predation mechanisms are induced by the presence of a  predator. So I would encourage you to look at this in a textbook, this  example. And then finally I'm just going to go through a series of  pictures that show all of the types of defenses that have been evolved  as anti-predation devices. They are the obvious ones like cacti with  spikes, or porcupines with spikes, octopi with ink defense. This is a  caterpillar that has evolved to look like a snake, at least that's the  way it looks to us. I mean that's a hypothesis, that the predation on  this would be reduced because it looks like a predator itself.</p>
<p>These  are two different ones looking like a snake. And often, snakes have a  bright colored thing on their tail to draw attention to the tail. If  you're going to be attacked by a predator, you'd rather have your tail  attacked than your head. So, this is a common motif in nature. And this  is an insect. This is its head. And yet, if you're a predator you'd  probably think this was its head. And again, whether that's been  established by experiments, I don't know. So these are just examples.  Moths often have features that look like eyes that what tends to ward  off a predator. This is an interesting story that is in your readings  that shows that there are just a few genes that control the phenotype of  this particular butterfly.</p>
<p>I think it's a moth, between having  these spots and not having the spots. In the fall, when it's dry and  it's more selective advantage to look like a leaf, they look like this.  But at other times, they're visible anyway so their selective advantage  is to have these eye spots that make them look like they have eyes. OK, I  think it's time to quit, so we'll pick this up next time, I promise  you. Their wonderful pictures of the creatures in the deep sea that are  very evil looking predators that fish with their luminescent light  organs.</p>
