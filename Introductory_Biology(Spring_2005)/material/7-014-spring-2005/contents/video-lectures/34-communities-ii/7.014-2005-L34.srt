1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
OK, so the last lecture we were
talking about competition,

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:08
and the result of competition
between organisms.

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:13
And I didn't quite finish,
so I just want to finish up on that

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:17
lecture, and then will move on to
predation, an interaction between

5
00:00:17 --> 00:00:22
two species which results in
increasing the fitness and one,

6
00:00:22 --> 00:00:26
and decreasing the fitness in the
other. But let's just finish up

7
00:00:26 --> 00:00:31
with competition.
We were talking about character

8
00:00:31 --> 00:00:36
displacement and beak depths.
And we have shown that when you

9
00:00:36 --> 00:00:42
have two closely related birds with
the same beak size,

10
00:00:42 --> 00:00:47
if they live on islands separate
from one another,

11
00:00:47 --> 00:00:52
they compete for the same food.
But if you live on an island

12
00:00:52 --> 00:00:58
together, what happens is that you
have this character displacement

13
00:00:58 --> 00:01:03
where the beak of what will get
bigger and the beak of the other

14
00:01:03 --> 00:01:12
will get smaller.
So they can exploit different food

15
00:01:12 --> 00:01:26
resources. And this character
displacement is the beginning of

16
00:01:26 --> 00:01:36
species formation.
And this is very common on islands.

17
00:01:36 --> 00:01:43
And these are the famous finches
from the Galapagos Islands that

18
00:01:43 --> 00:01:49
Darwin first based his theory of
evolution, or it was an important

19
00:01:49 --> 00:01:56
part of his theory of evolution,
where he realized that there must

20
00:01:56 --> 00:02:03
have been an ancestor finch,
that all of these other finches that

21
00:02:03 --> 00:02:11
had different representation on
different islands evolved from

22
00:02:11 --> 00:02:19
through the slow change in traits
that is selected as a result of

23
00:02:19 --> 00:02:27
different combination of species
being together or alone in different

24
00:02:27 --> 00:02:35
islands. And this is what's called
adaptive radiation.

25
00:02:35 --> 00:02:40
And this is really a powerful
mechanism for evolution.

26
00:02:40 --> 00:02:46
This is the Galapagos finches,
but you also see this in an extreme

27
00:02:46 --> 00:02:51
form in Hawaii among the honey
creepers showing this incredible

28
00:02:51 --> 00:02:57
diversity of beak types that have
evolved to exploit different

29
00:02:57 --> 00:03:03
kinds of food.
OK, so before we go on to predation,

30
00:03:03 --> 00:03:09
I just want to walk you through an
evolutionary scenario,

31
00:03:09 --> 00:03:16
so that you can see how this might
work on an island,

32
00:03:16 --> 00:03:23
Archipelago. So this is the
mainland, and we're going to start

33
00:03:23 --> 00:03:29
with an ancestor species,
A, and our Archipelago is going to

34
00:03:29 --> 00:03:37
have three islands.
OK, let me draw this.

35
00:03:37 --> 00:03:52
Here's the same three islands.

36
00:03:52 --> 00:04:03
So this is time passing.
So as we move,

37
00:04:03 --> 00:04:09
these are the same three islands as
a function of time passing,

38
00:04:09 --> 00:04:16
OK? So at the beginning, we're
going to have our founder species

39
00:04:16 --> 00:04:23
flying and colonizing the island.
OK, so A is on this island. And so,

40
00:04:23 --> 00:04:30
the first thing that happens is that
A evolves and becomes B.

41
00:04:30 --> 00:04:35
So each one of these is just the
name of the species,

42
00:04:35 --> 00:04:41
OK? This is species A,
species B, through what's known as

43
00:04:41 --> 00:04:46
the founder effect.
And that is when you have a few

44
00:04:46 --> 00:04:52
members of the species colonizing on
this island. You have a tiny gene

45
00:04:52 --> 00:04:58
pool, and the genetic composition of
this drifts such that it actually

46
00:04:58 --> 00:05:04
becomes a different species from the
one on the mainland.

47
00:05:04 --> 00:05:10
So, A becomes B.
So the full arrow means becomes B

48
00:05:10 --> 00:05:17
on the islands through the founder
effect. And now,

49
00:05:17 --> 00:05:23
we're going to have B migrate to a
new island. So,

50
00:05:23 --> 00:05:30
A is now B on this island,
right?

51
00:05:30 --> 00:05:39
And B is going to colonize this
island. And through that same

52
00:05:39 --> 00:05:49
founder effect,
B becomes C. So let me just write

53
00:05:49 --> 00:05:58
what's happening here.
B becomes C. I think you can see

54
00:05:58 --> 00:06:08
what's happening on one island,
and then it migrates back.

55
00:06:08 --> 00:06:19
So, let's let C migrate back to
where B is, and C also founds a new

56
00:06:19 --> 00:06:31
island. So, we're going
to let C migrate here.

57
00:06:31 --> 00:06:38
So we end up with C and B here now
able to compete with each other,

58
00:06:38 --> 00:06:46
C here and C here. OK, so we've got
a new combination of species,

59
00:06:46 --> 00:06:54
and we are going to let C become D
here due to the founder effect,

60
00:06:54 --> 00:07:02
and D is going to migrate over to
this island.

61
00:07:02 --> 00:07:32
So, C becomes E when with B because
of character displacement.

62
00:07:32 --> 00:07:40
So, C becomes E here when it's with
B. So you end up with E and B on

63
00:07:40 --> 00:07:48
this island. D is going to migrate
to this island.

64
00:07:48 --> 00:07:56
So, we have C and D here.
And, C has evolved to be D here.

65
00:07:56 --> 00:08:04
So, we also have C becomes D when
alone.

66
00:08:04 --> 00:08:09
OK, so this is just a scenario we
are making up.

67
00:08:09 --> 00:08:15
OK, you can make up any scenario.
But it's to give you the idea of

68
00:08:15 --> 00:08:21
how this adaptive radiation comes
about. So, starting with one single

69
00:08:21 --> 00:08:26
species on the mainland,
if you have an island archipelago

70
00:08:26 --> 00:08:32
where species can be isolated enough
from each other to restrict,

71
00:08:32 --> 00:08:38
but not completely eliminate,
the gene flow you can have this

72
00:08:38 --> 00:08:45
rapid adaptive radiation.
So, evolutionary biologists often

73
00:08:45 --> 00:08:53
study islands in order to study this
phenomenon. OK,

74
00:08:53 --> 00:09:02
so just to summarize for competition,
interspecific

75
00:09:02 --> 00:09:18
competition results in

76
00:09:18 --> 00:09:32
either competitive coexistence,
which can be achieved either through

77
00:09:32 --> 00:09:42
niche differentiation.
Do you remember,

78
00:09:42 --> 00:09:50
what was an example of that last
time? The barnacles and the inner

79
00:09:50 --> 00:09:58
tidal. One took the high road,
and one took the low road. That's

80
00:09:58 --> 00:10:06
called niche differentiation,
or character displacement.

81
00:10:06 --> 00:10:10
And this can happen very rapidly.
I hesitate to tell you about really

82
00:10:10 --> 00:10:15
interesting things that you don't
have to know, but I will anyway.

83
00:10:15 --> 00:10:19
This is really interesting study by
a couple at Princeton of the

84
00:10:19 --> 00:10:24
Galapagos finches.
And they've shown that you can have

85
00:10:24 --> 00:10:29
character displacement of the
islands over a period of one or two

86
00:10:29 --> 00:10:34
years, just depending on
the amount of rainfall.

87
00:10:34 --> 00:10:41
So, it can happen very rapidly by
just selecting for different

88
00:10:41 --> 00:10:48
character traits,
or competitive exclusion,

89
00:10:48 --> 00:10:55
which is the case where the niche
overlap is so great that one of the

90
00:10:55 --> 00:11:02
species completely outcompete
the other.

91
00:11:02 --> 00:11:07
The example from last time was the
zebra mussels and Gause's paramecia

92
00:11:07 --> 00:11:12
in the test tubes excluding the
other. So, these are really

93
00:11:12 --> 00:11:17
important ecological and
evolutionary forces.

94
00:11:17 --> 00:11:22
The other thing I learned from your
comments, which I was very heartened

95
00:11:22 --> 00:11:27
by, is that at least one person
really liked the definition of the

96
00:11:27 --> 00:11:32
niche, of the N-dimensional hyper
volume, which I have always loved

97
00:11:32 --> 00:11:37
and I think is fundamentally
important because people throw

98
00:11:37 --> 00:11:42
around ecological niche in everyday
language and think of it as a place

99
00:11:42 --> 00:11:51
in the environment.
And I think that a more robust

100
00:11:51 --> 00:12:04
definition is so much more useful.
So, let's move onto predation,

101
00:12:04 --> 00:12:15
which is a very strong evolutionary
force. It can control population

102
00:12:15 --> 00:12:26
dynamics. It can shape community
structure. We're going to talk

103
00:12:26 --> 00:12:39
about each of these.
It actually influences competition,

104
00:12:39 --> 00:12:53
which in turn shapes community
structure. And it's a powerful

105
00:12:53 --> 00:13:03
evolutionary agent.
In other words,

106
00:13:03 --> 00:13:10
it's very important in influencing
naturally selection.

107
00:13:10 --> 00:13:17
So, let's start with the classic,
here's a classic predator-prey

108
00:13:17 --> 00:13:24
interaction. There is two wolves
and a moose being attacked.

109
00:13:24 --> 00:13:32
The wolves are not evil. They're
just getting their meal.

110
00:13:32 --> 00:13:37
OK, this is a very famous classic
study of the snowshoe hare,

111
00:13:37 --> 00:13:42
and lynx. Lynx is a cat:
populations in northern Canada.

112
00:13:42 --> 00:13:48
And these data were collected by
the Hudson Bay Company trapping

113
00:13:48 --> 00:13:53
records. So, it's really from the
amount of animals that were actually

114
00:13:53 --> 00:13:59
trapped that these abundances come
from. And that's where these

115
00:13:59 --> 00:14:04
coupled oscillations,
this is the hare, and this is the

116
00:14:04 --> 00:14:10
lynx showing these couples
oscillations with a roughly

117
00:14:10 --> 00:14:16
11 year cycle.
And people spend a lot of time

118
00:14:16 --> 00:14:23
trying to understand what was
driving that oscillation.

119
00:14:23 --> 00:14:30
And mathematicians love these
coupled oscillators.

120
00:14:30 --> 00:14:36
And so, the first attempt to model
this kind of thing was using a very

121
00:14:36 --> 00:14:42
simple model. Remember we said the
dN/dt equals rN?

122
00:14:42 --> 00:14:48
That's our exponential growth
equation. And we also said before

123
00:14:48 --> 00:14:54
the dN/dt or that r is equal to the
birthrate (b) minus the

124
00:14:54 --> 00:15:01
death rate (d).
OK, so grossly oversimplifying the

125
00:15:01 --> 00:15:09
system, the first set of equations
that were used to try to describe

126
00:15:09 --> 00:15:16
this, are if you use for the
predator, you call the predator

127
00:15:16 --> 00:15:24
dN1/DT equals b1,
1 minus d1,N1. OK,

128
00:15:24 --> 00:15:30
so that's just this equation.
And they said,

129
00:15:30 --> 00:15:35
well, how do we modify this equation
so that the growth rate of the

130
00:15:35 --> 00:15:41
predator is somehow a function of
the density of the prey?

131
00:15:41 --> 00:15:46
Well, the easiest thing to do is
just make it proportional,

132
00:15:46 --> 00:15:51
right? So what they do is put N2 in
there. So, the prey population is

133
00:15:51 --> 00:15:57
going to be dN2/dt,
and we're going to the same thing:

134
00:15:57 --> 00:16:03
b2,N2 minus d2,N2,
and the question is how do we modify

135
00:16:03 --> 00:16:10
the prey growth rate equation so
that it is somehow a function of the

136
00:16:10 --> 00:16:16
density of the predator?
So what would you do? So here,

137
00:16:16 --> 00:16:23
this says the birthrate of the
predator is influenced.

138
00:16:23 --> 00:16:30
As prey density increases,
the birthrate of the predator

139
00:16:30 --> 00:16:37
increases.
How would you modify this equation

140
00:16:37 --> 00:16:43
so that the predator density has an
effect on it? It's pretty obvious,

141
00:16:43 --> 00:16:50
but I'm trying to get you with me.
Exactly. It would be the death term.

142
00:16:50 --> 00:16:57
As the predator numbers increase,
the death term would go up.

143
00:16:57 --> 00:17:08
And it turns out that these are two
coupled differential equations that

144
00:17:08 --> 00:17:19
make a beautiful oscillatory system,
a couple oscillators, perfect

145
00:17:19 --> 00:17:30
oscillators like that. This
is predator density.

146
00:17:30 --> 00:17:35
So that would be N1,
N2, and this is time if you chart

147
00:17:35 --> 00:17:41
their density with time.
And how many of you have actually

148
00:17:41 --> 00:17:46
had this in the course?
Yeah, see? [LAUGHTER] And what

149
00:17:46 --> 00:17:52
courses have you had in it?
Differential equations, yeah.

150
00:17:52 --> 00:17:58
Mathematicians love it. But real
populations, predator and prey,

151
00:17:58 --> 00:18:03
don't really operate this way.
I mean, you see these oscillations,

152
00:18:03 --> 00:18:08
but rarely can it be attributed
solely to the interaction between

153
00:18:08 --> 00:18:14
the predator and the prey.
There's usually many other factors.

154
00:18:14 --> 00:18:19
So, and I'll just give you one
example. So ecologists go ahead and

155
00:18:19 --> 00:18:24
say, OK, so what's really going on?
And here's an example. It turns

156
00:18:24 --> 00:18:30
out that in many cases,
the food supply of the prey is

157
00:18:30 --> 00:18:35
oscillating.
OK, so the availability of food to

158
00:18:35 --> 00:18:39
the prey oscillates,
making the prey population oscillate,

159
00:18:39 --> 00:18:43
which then can drive an oscillation
in the predator population.

160
00:18:43 --> 00:18:48
So, it's more than just the
coupling between the two.

161
00:18:48 --> 00:18:52
There are also an external
oscillators driving both of them.

162
00:18:52 --> 00:18:56
And again, I'd like to try to
address the role of

163
00:18:56 --> 00:19:02
experimentation.
Here is an experiment done with

164
00:19:02 --> 00:19:09
rabbits. And I don't know what the
predator was. It might have been,

165
00:19:09 --> 00:19:16
I'm not sure the predator was, but
anyway, rabbits,

166
00:19:16 --> 00:19:22
in which through experimentation
they increased the food supply to

167
00:19:22 --> 00:19:29
the rabbits through fertilization.
And they showed that, so this is

168
00:19:29 --> 00:19:35
the control.
And this is the phase of the cycle

169
00:19:35 --> 00:19:41
in the hare population relative to
the density in the controls.

170
00:19:41 --> 00:19:46
So, showing that when the food
supply was increased,

171
00:19:46 --> 00:19:52
the oscillation was still there.
So, it wasn't only relieving the

172
00:19:52 --> 00:19:57
rabbits of food limitation,
did not eliminate the oscillation,

173
00:19:57 --> 00:20:03
but if you'd excluded the predators,
you still also had the oscillation

174
00:20:03 --> 00:20:09
there.
And if you did both of them,

175
00:20:09 --> 00:20:16
it increased the amplitude of the
oscillation, relative to the control.

176
00:20:16 --> 00:20:23
So the conclusion from this is that
both food supply and the predation

177
00:20:23 --> 00:20:29
affected the oscillation.
Another very classic experiment is

178
00:20:29 --> 00:20:36
the experiment by Huffaker back when
people began to be enamored of these

179
00:20:36 --> 00:20:43
coupled differential equations.
People wanted to test the hypothesis

180
00:20:43 --> 00:20:50
of those equations in the laboratory.
And they tried to set up

181
00:20:50 --> 00:20:57
predator-prey systems in the lab,
and see if they can get them to go

182
00:20:57 --> 00:21:04
in these coupled oscillations for
many cycles. And Huffaker set up a

183
00:21:04 --> 00:21:12
system of a predatory mite
and a prey mite.

184
00:21:12 --> 00:21:22
Ecologists like to use insects as
experimental systems because they're

185
00:21:22 --> 00:21:32
small and you can do it in the lab.
And this one lived on oranges.

186
00:21:32 --> 00:21:38
So it was an herbivorous mite.
And the predator obviously lived on

187
00:21:38 --> 00:21:45
mites. And he set up a very simple
system in the lab of oranges,

188
00:21:45 --> 00:21:52
and introduced the predator and prey,
and inevitably he got this,

189
00:21:52 --> 00:21:59
where prey would increase, and then
the predator would increase,

190
00:21:59 --> 00:22:06
and would overshoot, and the prey
would die, and the predator

191
00:22:06 --> 00:22:13
would die.
So he only got one cycle,

192
00:22:13 --> 00:22:20
with a simple system could not get
this to persist,

193
00:22:20 --> 00:22:27
well, that doesn't even qualify as a
cycle. So he realized,

194
00:22:27 --> 00:22:33
so this is a simple system.
And he had a grid,

195
00:22:33 --> 00:22:39
which is shown up here in which he
had oranges. And he had them

196
00:22:39 --> 00:22:44
interspersed with rubber balls to
have a little bit of complexity in

197
00:22:44 --> 00:22:50
the system. But he found with that
design, he could not get the system

198
00:22:50 --> 00:22:55
to persist. So he hypothesized that
the reason it wouldn't persist is

199
00:22:55 --> 00:23:01
that it's much too simple,
not close enough to nature.

200
00:23:01 --> 00:23:06
So he introduced all kinds of
complexity. He increased the size

201
00:23:06 --> 00:23:11
of his grid relative to the
populations, which would give the

202
00:23:11 --> 00:23:16
prey mites more of a chance to get
away from the predator.

203
00:23:16 --> 00:23:21
He put barriers of dispersal,
like Vaseline moats, and he actually

204
00:23:21 --> 00:23:26
put little launching pads for the
prey. I don't know what they look

205
00:23:26 --> 00:23:31
like, diving boards,
I don't know what they were,

206
00:23:31 --> 00:23:36
but little launching pads that just
increased a lot of complexity so

207
00:23:36 --> 00:23:41
that it gave the prey an ability to
move around relative

208
00:23:41 --> 00:23:46
to the predator.
And he was actually able to,

209
00:23:46 --> 00:23:52
this shows his results over 200 days.
He was actually able to get three

210
00:23:52 --> 00:23:58
full cycles of the predator-prey
oscillation. And up here,

211
00:23:58 --> 00:24:04
it just shows you that they're sort
of a cat and mouse game going on.

212
00:24:04 --> 00:24:08
It shows you the location of the
prey mites relative to the predator

213
00:24:08 --> 00:24:12
mites at these different points in
time of this cycle,

214
00:24:12 --> 00:24:16
showing that they're moving around
the system, and that the complexity

215
00:24:16 --> 00:24:21
allowed this coupled oscillator to
persist. And of course,

216
00:24:21 --> 00:24:25
we present this because it was a
classic experiment.

217
00:24:25 --> 00:24:29
It was a pioneering experiment,
but I mean, there have been a lot

218
00:24:29 --> 00:24:34
more since then.
And of course,

219
00:24:34 --> 00:24:38
it has implications for stability of
populations in the natural world.

220
00:24:38 --> 00:24:43
As we make the natural world less
and less complex,

221
00:24:43 --> 00:24:48
it reduces the ability of
populations that are engaged in

222
00:24:48 --> 00:24:52
these coupled oscillatory systems to
persist. It increases the

223
00:24:52 --> 00:24:57
likelihood of extinction.
So this was like a tiny little

224
00:24:57 --> 00:25:02
localized extinction in his
experimental system.

225
00:25:02 --> 00:25:15
Another classic example that's often
cited about the role of predation in

226
00:25:15 --> 00:25:28
regulating population dynamics has
to do with rubber plantations over

227
00:25:28 --> 00:25:37
here in Malaysia.
Did I spell that right?

228
00:25:37 --> 00:25:42
That looks wrong. Oh well,
is that OK? And I don't have any

229
00:25:42 --> 00:25:48
data for you. So this is just a
story, but it's very compelling,

230
00:25:48 --> 00:25:53
and there is data somewhere but I
don't have a slide.

231
00:25:53 --> 00:25:58
But, in the first half of the
century, in its rubber plantations

232
00:25:58 --> 00:26:04
in Malaysia they had a tremendous
diversity of insects,

233
00:26:04 --> 00:26:09
but didn't have any real serious
problems with insect pests in the

234
00:26:09 --> 00:26:15
rubber plantations.
And, in 1950, they had a small

235
00:26:15 --> 00:26:21
outbreak of defoliated caterpillars.
And that was right about the time

236
00:26:21 --> 00:26:27
that DDT was invented and
synthesized, and became available.

237
00:26:27 --> 00:26:33
And so, entomologists came down and
sprayed the plantation with DDT

238
00:26:33 --> 00:26:40
hoping to get rid of
this caterpillar.

239
00:26:40 --> 00:26:44
In the next year,
the outbreak got bigger.

240
00:26:44 --> 00:26:48
They sprayed more. The next year
the outbreak got bigger.

241
00:26:48 --> 00:26:52
They sprayed more, and finally the
whole thing was out of control.

242
00:26:52 --> 00:26:56
And they said what's going on here?
We are killing these things, and

243
00:26:56 --> 00:27:00
it's getting bigger.
To make a long story short,

244
00:27:00 --> 00:27:04
what they were doing, this is a
cocoon.

245
00:27:04 --> 00:27:12
Oh boy. How do you spell cocoon?
That's not right. Is that right?

246
00:27:12 --> 00:27:21
Anyway, you know what I mean.
Caterpillars live in cocoons,

247
00:27:21 --> 00:27:29
and there was a, that's a wasp with
a big, long organ that

248
00:27:29 --> 00:27:36
it lays its eggs.
It needs some legs,

249
00:27:36 --> 00:27:40
doesn't it? OK, I made some front
legs too. There.

250
00:27:40 --> 00:27:44
OK, so that's a wasp that lays its
eggs in these caterpillar cocoons,

251
00:27:44 --> 00:27:49
and in doing so, kills caterpillars.
And what they were doing with the

252
00:27:49 --> 00:27:53
DDT, is that they were killing the
natural predator of the wasp.

253
00:27:53 --> 00:27:57
And the caterpillars themselves,
while they were in the cocoon, were

254
00:27:57 --> 00:28:02
actually protected from the DDT.
So the more they put on,

255
00:28:02 --> 00:28:07
the more they killed the wasp,
and the caterpillars were released

256
00:28:07 --> 00:28:13
from this controlling predation,
and they had huge outbreaks. So,

257
00:28:13 --> 00:28:18
it's another example of in nature
it's really hard,

258
00:28:18 --> 00:28:23
you can't see what's controlling
what until you disrupt it.

259
00:28:23 --> 00:28:28
You have to experiment either
inadvertently or on purpose because

260
00:28:28 --> 00:28:34
everything is dynamic
and turning over.

261
00:28:34 --> 00:28:40
But it looks relatively stable.
And that's why this is so hard.

262
00:28:40 --> 00:28:46
And this is one of my favorite
examples of this,

263
00:28:46 --> 00:28:52
because it brings together a lot of
concepts that we've been talking

264
00:28:52 --> 00:28:59
about, is predation shapes
community structure.

265
00:28:59 --> 00:29:12
And this is another example of

266
00:29:12 --> 00:29:22
introduced species.
And this is St. John's Wort,

267
00:29:22 --> 00:29:32
which was introduced at California
from Europe.

268
00:29:32 --> 00:29:44
And, it, so I'm going to draw a
couple of habitats here.

269
00:29:44 --> 00:29:56
This is a forest, and this is a
meadow. So this is grass,

270
00:29:56 --> 00:30:06
OK, this is trees.
And these are St.

271
00:30:06 --> 00:30:14
John's Wort. So, it could grow
equally well in the meadow and in

272
00:30:14 --> 00:30:23
the forest. And it was getting out
of control so they introduced a

273
00:30:23 --> 00:30:31
beetle from Europe that feeds on St.
John's Wort to try to bring it in to

274
00:30:31 --> 00:30:41
under control.
And what they found was that the

275
00:30:41 --> 00:30:51
beetle, because the beetle's
preferred habitat was the meadow

276
00:30:51 --> 00:31:01
that St. John's Wort persisted in
the forests but was eliminated

277
00:31:01 --> 00:31:08
from the meadow.
Now, because the beetle prefers the

278
00:31:08 --> 00:31:13
sunny habitat of the meadow,
so if you were an ecologist and you

279
00:31:13 --> 00:31:19
didn't know that this beetle had
been introduced,

280
00:31:19 --> 00:31:24
you just walked into this state,
you knew nothing about the history,

281
00:31:24 --> 00:31:29
you wanted to study the ecological
niche of St. John's Wort,

282
00:31:29 --> 00:31:35
you would say, well, I only find it
in the forest.

283
00:31:35 --> 00:31:40
It must like cooler,
wetter environments because you

284
00:31:40 --> 00:31:46
wouldn't really know that it was
being controlled by the presence of

285
00:31:46 --> 00:31:52
this beetle. So, this
is a perfect example.

286
00:31:52 --> 00:32:03
If we draw the niche or two
dimensions of the ecological niche

287
00:32:03 --> 00:32:15
of St. John's Wort,
and we say that just on these two

288
00:32:15 --> 00:32:27
dimensions that this is the
fundamental niche on the moisture

289
00:32:27 --> 00:32:36
light gradient,
in the presence of this beetle,

290
00:32:36 --> 00:32:42
the realized niche is only this low
light, high moisture environment

291
00:32:42 --> 00:32:48
that you find in the forest.
OK, so in other words, to really

292
00:32:48 --> 00:32:54
understand what's regulating the
ecology of a particular organism,

293
00:32:54 --> 00:33:00
you have to understand all of the
other organisms that it's

294
00:33:00 --> 00:33:06
interacting with,
and what their effect is on this.

295
00:33:06 --> 00:33:11
And again, that's why it's so

296
00:33:11 --> 00:33:16
impossible to do this without some
form of experiment,

297
00:33:16 --> 00:33:21
either manipulative experiments like
I described, or experiments done in

298
00:33:21 --> 00:33:25
a lab, or inadvertent experiments by
introducing species.

299
00:33:25 --> 00:33:30
OK, now let's talk about a couple
of other really classic experiments

300
00:33:30 --> 00:33:35
that have been done.
And these are experiments that have

301
00:33:35 --> 00:33:40
illustrated the concept of keystone
predator. There are some predators

302
00:33:40 --> 00:33:45
and ecosystems that are what are
called keystones.

303
00:33:45 --> 00:33:50
And that is if you remove them,
the entire structure of the

304
00:33:50 --> 00:33:55
community changes.
There are some that if you move

305
00:33:55 --> 00:34:00
them, it doesn't have a dramatic
effect, but there are certain ones

306
00:34:00 --> 00:34:06
that are keystone predators
that it does.

307
00:34:06 --> 00:34:12
And these, of course,
are species that conservation

308
00:34:12 --> 00:34:19
biologists want to first identify,
and second conserve above others

309
00:34:19 --> 00:34:26
because there is a cascade of
effects if something happens to them.

310
00:34:26 --> 00:34:33
A classic example of this was a
study by Robert Payne many years ago

311
00:34:33 --> 00:34:41
in the inner tidal community.
I'm not going to go into the details

312
00:34:41 --> 00:34:51
of that, but the rocky inner tidal
community is made up of the starfish,

313
00:34:51 --> 00:35:01
which is called pisaster,
one of the top predators.

314
00:35:01 --> 00:35:09
And there are also limpets,
chitins, if you grew up in

315
00:35:09 --> 00:35:17
California you know probably what
these are, mussels.

316
00:35:17 --> 00:35:25
These are invertebrates-like
barnacles that stick to the ground,

317
00:35:25 --> 00:35:33
or stick to the rocks, and also
algae that stick to the rocks.

318
00:35:33 --> 00:35:38
And Payne hypothesized that the
predator was maintaining this

319
00:35:38 --> 00:35:43
diversity. And the way to test that
hypothesis was to put a cage over

320
00:35:43 --> 00:35:49
everything and eliminate the
predator from certain areas.

321
00:35:49 --> 00:35:54
At what he showed was that that's
what that ecosystem looks like if

322
00:35:54 --> 00:36:00
you eliminate the predator.
You can see here, here's the algae.

323
00:36:00 --> 00:36:05
Here are some articles.
This is a new textbook,

324
00:36:05 --> 00:36:10
see if you get the full story there,
but there's a lot of diversity of

325
00:36:10 --> 00:36:15
the small barnacle-like
invertebrates.

326
00:36:15 --> 00:36:20
Then you eliminate the predator,
and the mussels just completely take

327
00:36:20 --> 00:36:25
over. And this is preemptive
competition. They compete with

328
00:36:25 --> 00:36:30
everything else for space and
nothing else can survive there.

329
00:36:30 --> 00:36:36
Another example of a keystone
predator is the sea otter,

330
00:36:36 --> 00:36:42
which keeps the sea urchins in check
in the bottom of the substrate,

331
00:36:42 --> 00:36:49
and if the sea otter is not there
the sea urchins takeover and they

332
00:36:49 --> 00:36:55
exclude the kelp,
the entire kelp forests and all the

333
00:36:55 --> 00:37:02
fishes that lives in the kelp
forests, and all of the diversity of

334
00:37:02 --> 00:37:08
the ecosystem relies on the sea
otter's ability to keep the sea

335
00:37:08 --> 00:37:15
urchin population in check.
OK, so some of the best evidence for

336
00:37:15 --> 00:37:22
predation as an evolutionary agent,
or something that's driving the

337
00:37:22 --> 00:37:30
natural selection of organisms,
are these defenses that have evolved

338
00:37:30 --> 00:37:36
to avoid predation.
In other words,

339
00:37:36 --> 00:37:41
if you're constantly under attack,
your fitness will be increased by

340
00:37:41 --> 00:37:46
features that reduce your
susceptibility to predation.

341
00:37:46 --> 00:37:52
So in this case, there are a lot of
experiments. I'm going to show you

342
00:37:52 --> 00:37:57
a few, but a picture's worth a
thousand words here.

343
00:37:57 --> 00:38:03
I'll show you some examples.
Cryptic coloration is when a prey

344
00:38:03 --> 00:38:09
organism has color features that
make it blend in to the environment.

345
00:38:09 --> 00:38:15
So here's a very famous example
that was actually in another

346
00:38:15 --> 00:38:21
inadvertent experiment.
This is a moth that comes in two

347
00:38:21 --> 00:38:27
forms. This is called the melanic
form, which is dark black or gray,

348
00:38:27 --> 00:38:33
and this is the other form which is
much lighter.

349
00:38:33 --> 00:38:37
And here it is on a birch tree.
You can see that this one blends it

350
00:38:37 --> 00:38:42
beautifully, whereas this one,
if I were a predator looking for the

351
00:38:42 --> 00:38:47
moth, I would see this but I
wouldn't see that.

352
00:38:47 --> 00:38:52
Here's the same two moths on
another tree with darker bark

353
00:38:52 --> 00:38:56
showing that in this case,
this one would be more fit in that

354
00:38:56 --> 00:39:01
one would be less fit.
And there's a very famous study

355
00:39:01 --> 00:39:06
that I don't have time to go into,
but it's a textbook, that showed

356
00:39:06 --> 00:39:11
experimentally the relative fitness
between these two forms,

357
00:39:11 --> 00:39:16
depending on the color of the tree
trunks.

358
00:39:16 --> 00:39:21
And this whole example is called
industrial melanism because the

359
00:39:21 --> 00:39:26
reason this was noticed was that in
areas of high industrialization the

360
00:39:26 --> 00:39:32
tree trunks are darker colored
because of the air pollution.

361
00:39:32 --> 00:39:36
This is back in England back in the
days when there is a lot more air

362
00:39:36 --> 00:39:41
pollution. So,
they were able to show a shift in

363
00:39:41 --> 00:39:46
the frequency of these two forms as
a function of the amount of

364
00:39:46 --> 00:39:51
pollution and environment because
their susceptibility to predation

365
00:39:51 --> 00:39:55
was reduced if this form dominated.
That study is actually rather

366
00:39:55 --> 00:40:00
controversial now,
so I won't teach you the details.

367
00:40:00 --> 00:40:06
But you get the point.
But these moths exist in these two

368
00:40:06 --> 00:40:12
forms. Here's another example
that's really convoluted that's in

369
00:40:12 --> 00:40:18
your textbook.
So I'm not going to write it on the

370
00:40:18 --> 00:40:24
board. You can read about it there.
But it's an example of what's

371
00:40:24 --> 00:40:30
called the evolutionary arms race.
And it has to do with Cottonwood

372
00:40:30 --> 00:40:36
trees. And Cottonwood trees produce
a defense compound that the name of

373
00:40:36 --> 00:40:43
which is on the next slide:
salicorten.

374
00:40:43 --> 00:40:50
It doesn't matter what it's
called, it's a toxic compound that

375
00:40:50 --> 00:40:57
makes the tree distasteful to
predator. You don't think of

376
00:40:57 --> 00:41:05
predators of trees.
The beaver is a tree predator.

377
00:41:05 --> 00:41:10
It chops it down.
So when a beaver chops it down,

378
00:41:10 --> 00:41:15
a Cottonwood tree, the Cottonwood
tree sprouts new sprouts.

379
00:41:15 --> 00:41:21
And the resprouts have much higher
concentrations of this toxic

380
00:41:21 --> 00:41:26
compound than the parent tree had.
In other words, the tree has a

381
00:41:26 --> 00:41:32
mechanism. And I'm sure we don't
understand that yet,

382
00:41:32 --> 00:41:37
but someday we'll understand the
genetic underpinnings of this,

383
00:41:37 --> 00:41:43
the molecular biology of beaver
defenses.

384
00:41:43 --> 00:41:47
But if it's been felled by a beaver,
it increases the production of this

385
00:41:47 --> 00:41:52
toxin in the shoots that come out
saying, OK, fool me once,

386
00:41:52 --> 00:41:56
but you're not getting to get me the
next time. It means there's beavers

387
00:41:56 --> 00:42:01
around. But the interesting thing
is that these shoots are much more

388
00:42:01 --> 00:42:06
susceptible to grazing
by a leaf beetle.

389
00:42:06 --> 00:42:10
In other words,
this increased toxin,

390
00:42:10 --> 00:42:15
the shoots that have the increased
toxin, are actually grazed more than

391
00:42:15 --> 00:42:19
the parent tree by this leaf beetle.
So scientists went in and said, you

392
00:42:19 --> 00:42:24
know, what's going on here?
This is weird. Why make a defense

393
00:42:24 --> 00:42:29
that makes you more vulnerable to a
different predator?

394
00:42:29 --> 00:42:33
And what they showed by experiment
was that these leaf beetles were

395
00:42:33 --> 00:42:38
using that toxin as a defense
against the ants that

396
00:42:38 --> 00:42:43
want to eat them.
So, they were less susceptible to

397
00:42:43 --> 00:42:49
predation by ants because they had
taken in the toxin from the shoots.

398
00:42:49 --> 00:42:55
So, it's called the evolutionary
arms race between predator and prey.

399
00:42:55 --> 00:43:01
In these systems get very
complex.

400
00:43:01 --> 00:43:07
So here's the data that shows that,
that the control trees, trees that

401
00:43:07 --> 00:43:13
haven't been felled by a beaver
compared to trees that have been

402
00:43:13 --> 00:43:19
felled by a beaver,
and resprouted trees have a much

403
00:43:19 --> 00:43:25
higher concentration of this toxin.
And this is the larval survival

404
00:43:25 --> 00:43:31
time of these leaf beetles that
these are from the control trees

405
00:43:31 --> 00:43:37
versus the browsed trees in the
presence of the ants.

406
00:43:37 --> 00:43:43
OK, I'm going to skip that one.
That ones in your book, too, which

407
00:43:43 --> 00:43:50
has an experiment showing that
anti-predation mechanisms are

408
00:43:50 --> 00:43:57
induced by the presence of a
predator. So I would encourage you

409
00:43:57 --> 00:44:04
to look at this in a textbook,
this example.

410
00:44:04 --> 00:44:09
And then finally I'm just going to
go through a series of pictures that

411
00:44:09 --> 00:44:15
show all of the types of defenses
that have been evolved as

412
00:44:15 --> 00:44:20
anti-predation devices.
They are the obvious ones like

413
00:44:20 --> 00:44:26
cacti with spikes,
or porcupines with spikes,

414
00:44:26 --> 00:44:32
octopi with ink defense. This is a
caterpillar that has evolved to look

415
00:44:32 --> 00:44:38
like a snake, at least that's the
way it looks to us.

416
00:44:38 --> 00:44:42
I mean that's a hypothesis,
that the predation on this would be

417
00:44:42 --> 00:44:46
reduced because it looks like a
predator itself.

418
00:44:46 --> 00:44:50
These are two different ones
looking like a snake.

419
00:44:50 --> 00:44:54
And often, snakes have a bright
colored thing on their tail to draw

420
00:44:54 --> 00:44:58
attention to the tail.
If you're going to be attacked by a

421
00:44:58 --> 00:45:02
predator, you'd rather have your
tail attacked than your head.

422
00:45:02 --> 00:45:08
So, this is a common motif in nature.
And this is an insect.

423
00:45:08 --> 00:45:14
This is its head. And yet,
if you're a predator you'd probably

424
00:45:14 --> 00:45:20
think this was its head.
And again, whether that's been

425
00:45:20 --> 00:45:26
established by experiments,
I don't know. So these are just

426
00:45:26 --> 00:45:32
examples. Moths often have features
that look like eyes that what tends

427
00:45:32 --> 00:45:37
to ward off a predator.
This is an interesting story that is

428
00:45:37 --> 00:45:43
in your readings that shows that
there are just a few genes that

429
00:45:43 --> 00:45:48
control the phenotype of this
particular butterfly.

430
00:45:48 --> 00:45:53
I think it's a moth, between having
these spots and not having the spots.

431
00:45:53 --> 00:45:59
In the fall, when it's dry and it's
more selective advantage to look

432
00:45:59 --> 00:46:04
like a leaf, they look like this.
But at other times,

433
00:46:04 --> 00:46:08
they're visible anyway so their
selective advantage is to have these

434
00:46:08 --> 00:46:13
eye spots that make them look like
they have eyes.

435
00:46:13 --> 00:46:17
OK, I think it's time to quit,
so we'll pick this up next time,

436
00:46:17 --> 00:46:22
I promise you. Their wonderful
pictures of the creatures in the

437
00:46:22 --> 00:46:26
deep sea that are very evil looking
predators that fish with their

438
00:46:26 --> 00:46:29
luminescent light organs.
