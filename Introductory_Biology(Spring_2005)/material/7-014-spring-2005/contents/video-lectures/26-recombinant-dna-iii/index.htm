<p></p>
<p>So I just want to back up a couple because I think there's still some  confusion about what a restriction enzyme is and exactly what it does,  although I indicated, a three prime hydroxyl and a five-prime phosphate.  Let me show you. This is the way a lot, at least a large class of  restriction enzymes, went. We've seen a deoxyribose backbone before with  a phosphate backbone going on up to the next nucleotide. This is the  five-prime position.</p> <p>This is the three prime position. There is a phosphate here. It goes  down to the next one. It goes down like this. So what I'm showing you,  GAATTC, five prime to three prime, here's where I indicated the first  cut comes from. And I indicated that the cleavage generates a G with a  three prime hydroxyl, and the G ends up with a five prime phosphate. So  what that means is that the hydrolysis happens right there, so that  after cleavage, what you end up with is a five-prime phosphate and three  prime hydroxyl. This is paired with the C on the opposite strand. It  makes one cut here, and then it would make an identical cut on the  opposite strand. So if we were to pull those apart this strand here  would have G with its three prime OH, and the other strand would be  TTAA. And if we were to pull the apart.</p> <p>We'd have A A T T C, a three prime OH here, five prime phosphate  there, five prime phosphate there. Again, you have to remember, this  strand is going five prime, three prime in that direction. This was  going five prime, three prime in the end. And the beauty of these  restriction enzymes, at least it's not true of all of them. But it's  true of a lot of them as they generate these what are called sticky  ends. You can pull them apart. They come back together, though, and  reform those base pairs. It's almost like having little bits of Velcro  at the end. And when this end is looking for a complementary sequence to  pair with.</p> <p>It doesn't know what's out here, and it doesn't know what's out  there, all it sees as this. So I can cut this and rejoin it or I can cut  them and pull apart, take another piece of DNA that's been cut with the  same enzyme and therefore has the same corresponding little sticky ends  on each end, and it could insert right in the middle. And that's the  principle of cloning. And it was the development of these, if you will,  magic scissors that made it possible to take this DNA which looks so  homogeneous, nothing but GA's, T's, and C's, and then cut it up in  defined ways.</p> <p>When I was a postdoc, a friend of mine had just purified $2 million  worth of EcoRI because he purified some of this enzyme. At that point,  the only way to get these things was to produce them yourself and purify  them. Now there are literally hundreds of these and they recognize  different sequences, and once people understood that they existed, then  they just started to look in different, usually they're from bacteria,  and they just looked in different bacteria until they found another one.  And then they purified it. So if you go to, say, any of the companies  that do stuff for recombinant DNA, you'll find lists like this. Funny  little abbreviations like EcoRI usually have something that tells you  some abbreviation related to the organism, from which the restriction  enzyme was isolated.</p> <p>And you can find things that will cut, I won't say every sequence,  but very, very, many sequences. There are literally hundreds of these,  and you just order them. And the next day, a FedEx package arrives with a  little bit of the enzyme that will cut at that sequence. Another  concept that seemed to be a problem, was what's a vector? So if you  understand that there are sequence specific molecular scissors, that if  we have a piece of DNA and there's an EcoRI site here, you would come to  think of it like that because it's going to cut in a slightly skewed  way.</p> <p>Maybe there's another one right here, another one over here. If we  take this DNA and cut it with this particular enzyme, we get a break  here. Then this will get this piece running from here to here. We'll get  this little piece here. We'll get this piece here, and will get  whatever goes off on those sides. So that's naked DNA in a test tube. So  I could cut any piece of DNA at some sites generating a bunch of  fragments and if I just took those fragments and transformed them into  E.</p> <p>coli, I took naked DNA, took it from the outside, put it inside, is  it going to replicate? No. Why not? Because there's a special signal  called the origin of replication that says "start replicating DNA here".  This came from a piece of human, lets say some of my DNA, it would not  have a signal in it that said to the E. coli replication machinery,  "start replicating DNA right here". So the principle of, apart from  being able to cut DNA fragments, is you have together to replicate so  you can make lots of lots of copies. The trick is to attach the DNA, at  least a widely used trick is to attach the DNA to something that has an  origin of replication that will work in the organism in question.</p> <p>And that was what we call a vector. So this is an E. coli cell.  Another thing that's very confusing is all the circles that show up in  this course. This is huge. The vector was double-stranded DNA that  maybe, let's say, had a unique EcoRI restriction site in it. That's the  only EcoRI restriction site. The other thing that we'd need to have is  an origin of DNA replication. So, that's why this plasmid is able to  propagate itself. This little circle of DNA is able to propagate itself,  and then some kind of selectable marker. And, most of the time that's a  drug-resistance, so although it doesn't have to be. And if we cut that  here, generate sticky ends, then we can take this fragment and stick it  in here, to give this piece here joined to the vector.</p> <p>And that's an insert. Let's say it was that piece there. In fact, if  you wanted to clone DNA in E. coli, and then have the plasmid work in  yeast, if you just take that plasmid that works, the vector with its  insert that works in E. coli and put it in the yeast, it won't replicate  either. And that's because these other languages other than the genetic  code are not universal. So, you also have to put also in a sequence  that said to the yeast replication machinery "start something here".  People call that a shuttle vector, something that will replicate in E.  coli or replicate in yeast, and the same principle applies to other  organisms Okay, now probably the trickiest thing, the thing where I sort  of muddled it on Friday, and I apologize for that, was this discovery  of restriction enzymes.</p> <p>And again, some of you were frustrated. You said, why do I waste  time? Why not just tell you stuff that's on the exam? Okay again, people  were talking about molecular scissors when I was an undergrad and grad  student, and chemists were trying to think if they could come up with  some way to get some specificity in how to cutting DNA. And the answer,  the discovery of restriction enzymes didn't come from that kind of  experiment.</p> <p>It came from somebody trying to understand what seemed to be a really  obscure piece of biology. Julie made up a lovely little slide. But I  think it basically did was I left at one of the little layers that I  usually show. So, let me just talk. Here's, again, what Luria saw when  he was doing these experiments. So, I'm going to tell you now what was  in strain A and B, and maybe that will help. But I wanted you first to  see it without knowing what anything beyond what Luria knew. OK, strain A  has no restriction enzyme, and no modification enzyme. And although  there are different types of modification enzymes, many of them are  methylases.</p> <p>So, we'll call that. And this one has a restriction enzyme. And, it  has corresponding methylase. Just to review that again, if you can  figure this pretty much out from first principles that if you were an  organism, and you had a restriction enzyme that would cut this, there  are two things you can possibly do to keep from cutting up your own DNA.  One is to never have that sequence of pure DNA.</p> <p>That would prevent you from cutting up your own DNA, even though it  has it. It's pretty constraining now, because somewhere in a particular  protein, you might need that little bit of sequence to encode something  that you need to make a critical protein. So instead what you find is  organisms have a restriction enzyme, have those sequences, but they  don't cut up their own DNA because they modify their own DNA, by  putting, in the case of this one, they put a methyl here. And I drew  that out the other day.</p> <p>You can see, you can put a methyl group on the exocyclic amino group  of adanine, and not interfere with base pairing. But what you can do, is  interfere with the way that the restriction enzymes sees that sequence.  And when the cell pulls the DNA apart, each of the old strands is  methylated, and a new strand is initially not methylated. But that's  enough keep the restriction enzyme from doing its thing. And then the  methylase will come along, find a sequence, and then the progeny strand,  the daughter strand, will begin to get methylated.</p> <p>So, once you get DNA methylated, you can propagate it as long as you  have the methyl group. So this was what was really underlying what Luria  did. But he didn't know that. Let me quickly just go through this  again. So he grew the strain, the phage on strain A, no restriction  enzyme, just plain old DNA. So, he picks a plaque that's probably about a  billion phage in a plaque, somewhere around 10^8, 10^9 probably, no  that's not true, a little less than that, somewhat less than that, but  lots and lots of phage particles in the plaque. Resuspend them and then  plate them out. And of course it grew on strain A.</p> <p>That's what it was growing on. That wouldn't surprise you at all. The  surprise was, even though he knew he had lots and lots of phage, hardly  any of them grew on strain B. But, he found a rare plaque that had  learned to grow. And he tested then, and this thing grows on strain B.  That was not a surprise because it had to grow on strain B to be up  there. And he tested, and it still grew on the strain A. So up until  now, everything we knew, everything we've talked about in that course,  you think, ah-ha, this original phage couldn't grow on strain B, but  it's mutated.</p> <p>Somehow. It's learned to grow on strain B. That would be a perfectly  reasonable explanation. But if that were the case, what would've  happened? Well it was growing on those phage, you pick them again, it  should still grow on A and B, and they still do. The problem with that  model was that they grew on strain A. They had trouble growing on strain  B. Now that we've learned to grow on strain B, but you hadn't forgotten  how to grow on strain A. But if you take the ones that were growing on  strain A, they grow on strain A, not a surprise. This is the problem  right here.</p> <p>If this was a mutant, permanent change, then we should have been able  to have it grow on strain B as well. So what was really happening in  there? Well, at the beginning, the phage DNA was lacking any kind of  modification. It grew fine on strain A, because there was no restriction  enzyme. When it went into strain B, that now had an enzyme, a  restriction enzyme that cut up any time it found that sequence. And so,  most of the phage that injected their DNA, those DNAs were trashed by  the restriction enzyme.</p> <p>But there is a methylase in there that's also able to methylate those  sequences. And what happened somewhere along the way was that there was  the methyl, on one phage DNA, and got enough methyls on there that the  phage could be replicated before it got cut up by the restriction  enzyme. Once the phage molecule has methylations on the site, it's able  to grow just fine on strain B, and it will be able to do that forever.  However, if you take that DNA with the methyls on it, and we put it back  strain A, it'll still grow, as this one doesn't have any kind of  restriction enzyme, but while it's growing its busy losing all the  methyls again.</p> <p>We are right back to where we started from. An obscure experiment,  one of the most obscure you could get, many people would have paid no  attention. It does not seem worth it. So, the phenomenon was called  restriction.</p> <p>They had to give it a name. It wasn't mutation. They said this phage  DNA was being restricted somehow when it grew on strain B. People called  them, postulated there must be a restriction enzyme that was doing this  restricting of phage growth. When they found out what was doing it,  they had discovered magic scissors that would cut DNA at particular  sequences. So, the point here again, to try and go back and do this, I  hope some of you will get this anyway, many of the really important  discoveries come out of basic research.</p> <p>They are easy to ridicule. Why would I spend money on cancer, human  disease or something, for somebody studying some little weird phenomenon  about phage. But if you want to trace back to the experiment, it sort  of started the biotech industry. It was the discovery of restriction  enzymes. It took a little while to discover what it was, but the reason  they were discovered, were people were trying to understand that  phenomenology. Once we got restriction enzymes, we already had ligase,  which is sort of the tape we'd need, and just to show you here, when we  go back to this one, you can see that if we put these together again, we  have a three prime hydroxyl, and a five-prime phosphate.</p> <p>That's what DNA ligase knows how to do, because that's how you seal  up the end of a Okazaki fragment. So, that particular part of the  molecular biology toolkit was already known to molecular biologists who  had been studying DNA replication. OK, so, if we took some DNA from  anything, and we cut up into pieces like this, and then we join them  with a vector that had been cut, so let's just sort of open it up a  little bit, this fragment would go in here into one vector molecule.</p> <p>This fragment would insert in another vector molecule, and so on and  so forth. Then we would have what I said was a library, and the problem  at this point is, so you transform those into E. coli, and now we have a  whole series of E. coli. They have their own chromosome, every one of  them because they still have to be a bacterium. So, let's take three  members of E.</p> <p>coli from this library, and they will all have this vector, but  they'll have, let's say, insert number 1, 2, 3. This insert is a little.  This insert is bigger, and so on. If we did it right. We have every  possible fragment of DNA from the original source sitting in its own  vector. And the whole collection of E. coli in this population in the  certain library, and the next part of the trick was, how do you find the  thing you want, especially if you take my DNA with 3 billion base  pairs. That's an awful lot of restriction fragments no matter what you  do.</p> <p>How do you go about doing it? So the experiment that I showed you at  the end of the lecture, cloning by complementation, is fairly simple,  and it was basically one of the first methods that was used to find  genes in recombinant library. And that would be, for example, something  that had thisGene mutation in the chromosomal DNA. This is what the  situation I'd described the other day.</p> <p>So, if we put the library into every cell, such that the bacterium we  transformed the library into was broken for the hisG gene, and that  mutant couldn't grow on minimal medium unless we put in added histadine.  But, if one member of that library had the wild type, hisG gene, let's  say it was this one here, maybe it had several genes on it. But let's  say over here.</p> <p>We had hisG+, then the strain is back to being able to synthesize  histidine because it's got all the enzymes. What I was pointing out was  this really is complementation, just like we did in that phage cross.  We've got one broken copy of the gene. We've got a good copy. And all  you need is one good copy, and you're back in business. What I was  saying at the end of the lecture was this is not a general solution,  though. If I wanted to find the corresponding histidine gene from my  DNA, and all of these biosynthetic pathways, pretty much they rose so  early in evolution, the biochemistry is essentially identical in all  cells. Can I use this approach to find the same gene for my DNA? What do  you think? Why don't you turn to somebody beside you and see if you can  talk for a minute, and then let's see if, I can think of at least a  couple of problems.</p> <p>Let's see if you can come up with one or two of them. Find somebody  near you and see if you can come up with anything. Anybody want to  volunteer? An idea of why it would not work? Or some of you think it  would? No ideas? God, it's Monday. [LAUGHTER] I feel like most of you  guys. Somebody, come on.</p> <p>What do you think? It's going to work? No idea? What has to happen  for it to work? I'll give you a vector that has my gene corresponding to  that enzyme. It's in E. coli. I need to make the protein. Yeah? No,  it's in the vector. We cloned it into an E. coli vector. So, that's got  it. Yeah? Well it'll have a language that will say "start  transcription", but whose language is it going to have? It's going to  have my transcriptional stuff. Will that work in E. coli? Even though  the open reading frame is fine, that's good. How about translation? I  didn't even tell you about that. There is actually some specific stuff  needed.</p> <p>That's not universal, either. So when you get the RNA you still have  to translate it. There is another thing that might mess us up. Do you  remember anything else about, yeah? Introns and exons? What if my gene  has introns in it, which it almost surely has? We have to get rid of  those. E. coli doesn't know what they are. It's not used to taking them  out. You see the issues? Although that's a cute thing and that helps you  find a gene from E. coli by complementing E. coli mutant, or maybe you  could do it with yeast if you had a factor that would replicate in  yeast, it wasn't a general solution. So people had to use a whole  variety of different ways.</p> <p>Here's another way. You know that you have that genetic code. That  was worked out years ago. So let's say I was a biochemist, and I'd found  a protein that I was interested in, and I purified it, and they got it  out to single protein, and then I could cut it up with things that  proteases that will cut the protein into pieces, and there are ways of  sequencing protein. I'm not going to tell you how it works in this  course.</p> <p>We just don't have time. But you can get the sequence of little  pieces of protein. And let's imagine that this was the sequence of part  of the protein that I purified. It's one of my enzymes [SOUND OFF/THEN  ON] and I'd like to find the gene. Well, how could I use that  information to figure out where the gene is in this library? So here's  the strategy. We get out the genetic code, which Gobind Khorana and  Marshall Nirenberg helped work out, and we say OK, alanine, and if you  look it up, what you'll find is that it's GC, and then it can be A T C  or G. It can be any of those. If we look up what the codon for  aspartate.</p> <p>We'll find that there's a G or an A, but it could be T, or it could  be C. We look up lysine; it'll mostly be A, but it could be A or G.  You'll notice the variation of those things is almost all in the third  codon if that hadn't struck you. Same thing with threonine: A, C, and  this is another one; therefore codons that encode this. And this one  asparagine is that. So knowing that piece of the protein doesn't define a  unique sequence.</p> <p>Though, what we could do it is we could synthesize what's called a  mixed probe. And that would mean when we are going to synthesize this  DNA and we'd start with a G building block. And then we'd add a C  building block. So, now we made G and C. And at the next step, we'd add  an equal mixture of A, T, G, and C. So, what we would get out of that  would be we'd be getting G, and then the next biosynthetic step would  give us G, C. And then the next biochemical step would give us GCA, GCT,  GCC, or GCG. At the next step, we'd add a G.</p> <p>So everyone of these would get a G. Everyone would get an A, and then  the next step, they would branch. And if you follow that out, you'll  see by the end you have a mixture of probes. One of them is going to be  the right one that you find in the DNA. Now if you work out the number  of possibilities, you'll discover that most of the time there is only  going to be one probe that's unique. Once you get to about 20  nucleotides, any sequence, on average, is represented once in the human  genome. So as long as you make the probe long enough, one of the things  in your mixture will be a defined probe. So, what we can take is we have  all these different pieces of DNA that are the logical variants you can  see here. And then we would label the probe with P32.</p> <p>It's a radioactive isotope, and it's very easy. You can add it to a  five-prime phosphate. There's a special enzyme that will very easily  take the terminal phosphate from ATP and put it over. It doesn't really  [SOUND OFF/THEN ON] for this course how we get it there. But we can do  is radioactively label the probe. So now we've got this mixture. And,  somewhere in this library is a piece of DNA that's going to have the  gene that's encoding the protein that we're interested in. So, how do  you go about trying to deal with that? So, what we'll do is we'll plate  our E. coli library onto a bunch of Petri plates. So, I won't put too  many colonies on here, so we can sort of see a pattern.</p> <p>But, we'd have probably a lot of them, and we'd have a bunch of  plates. You can work out statistically how many plates you have to have  to have a chance of finding your gene of interest. Then what we do, is  lay a membrane on the plate. It's a particular type of membrane, and  what that will do is it will make a copy of everything that's there, and  we're going to save the plate. And then we're going to treat the  membrane, OK? We've got a membrane that's got an identical pattern.  They've got some of the bacteria from the colonies stuck at the  corresponding parts on the membrane.</p> <p>We're going to lyse the E. coli; that means break them open so all  their insides spill out. We will denature the DNA by treating with a  condition. You can, for example, vary the pH and make the strands come  apart. That gives single stranded DNA, "ss" I'm using as an abbreviation  for single strand of the strands you pulled apart. And, this sticks to  the membrane. So, now we've got, at every one of these little positions  on the membrane something that looks like this. Here's the membrane, and  there's some sort of single stranded DNA that's stuck to the membrane  in that fashion.</p> <p>The DNA that's stuck here came from the bacterium here that had a  particular insert. Over here, we have all the E. coli DNA and the vector  DNA, but we will have a different piece of DNA in the vector. Everybody  with me? OK, so if we were now to take our radioactive probe that we  made up there and get the conditions just right, that single stranded  probe will come in, and it will try and find its complement. It'll form  hydrogen bonds because that's the lowest energy well. And, we think  about it thermodynamically. And, if we can get it right, the temperature  and the conditions right, nothing will stick unless it's an exact match  to the sequence. And, if we get the right probe that can form hydrogen  bonds with everything on here, and it's got P32 at this point, what will  happen is we'll have now, the probe will stick, say, to this particular  colony, now with radioactivity right there.</p> <p>So, put some photographic film over the membrane, and right here  there's P32, and that'll expose the film and nowhere else. And then,  when we develop, what we'll find is one, if this works well, anyway, one  spot. So, now we know that that piece, that colony had a piece of human  DNA in it that was related to the sequence from the protein that I had  purified.</p> <p>So we go back to this colony, I think our things have probably  migrated around a little bit here. Let's move this up just a little bit,  and make it a little better. So this one is this one. So, now I can go  back to this colony and pick it out. And, let's say it's this insert.  So, now I've found I can sequence the rest of that piece of DNA. We'll  talk about how we sequence DNA in the next lecture. So that's an  alternative way of identifying a clone of interest. There was a  particularly painful way of finding a gene in a library that we for the  most part do not have to do any more. It was called positional cloning.</p> <p>And for example the gene that when it's broken causes cystic  fibrosis, it's a very difficult disease. Humans who have cystic fibrosis  have a very tough time. So there's a great deal of interest in finding  the gene that was broken in these patients. Human geneticists, I showed  you something about pedigrees, they would have a chromosome. They might  have banding patterns, and they would have figured out that somewhere  along the chromosome that the gene for cystic fibrosis lay somewhere  between two genetic markers that they had identified. Now, the amount of  DNA between something that you knew that the gene was here, and  something knew that the gene was there, could be huge.</p> <p>It could be many, many, many times the size of the E. coli  chromosome. So, what people would do is they'd clone something from  here, a little piece of DNA from there, and also clone something and  they get a little piece of DNA from there. And then they go into the  library, and they try and find something that had this DNA and something  that extended in this direction the little bit. By the sort of thing  you'd have marker A somewhere in the middle of the cystic fibrosis gene  but you didn't know exactly where. You'd clone a little piece of DNA and  use that to find another one that overlapped with it. And that you'd  find, use that to find another piece of DNA.</p> <p>You'd walk your way over this way, and you'd start the same process  at the other end. And, every one of these things, the same kind of  operation that we've got here, so cycles, and cycles, and cycles of  acquiring the next adjacent piece of DNA, and working your way along  here. And you had to use more than one different restriction enzymes,  otherwise you wouldn't be able to get these overlaps. And by doing that,  eventually they were able to get all the DNA that was between these  markers.</p> <p>They knew the cystic fibrosis gene was there from the maps they had  made by studying human pedigrees. And then, once you knew the sequence,  then you'd take candidate genes, and you'd take a bunch of cystic  fibrosis patients, and you'd start to see if every person who had cystic  fibrosis had a mutation in that gene. And, eventually they got it.</p> <p>That process in the case of cystic fibrosis took five years to do  that with a huge team of people. And, I guess it was from 1985-1990. If  you wanted to do that experiment today. We come now to one of the most  widely used ways to finding a gene of interest, and that is you go to  the computer. The whole human genome sequence is in there. If we were to  do that experiment today, we'd say, well, I know what this gene is, so  you look that gene up in the database. And you knew what this gene was  and you look up the database. Then you just look at all the DNA that's  in the middle. And you'd see a whole series of open reading frames. And  you'd probably say, well, what do I know about the biology of cystic  fibrosis? Could I make a guess? Is it a membrane protein? Is it not a  membrane protein? And, there are certain characteristics that would  probably allow you to make a guess.</p> <p>And then, you could jump right in and start sequencing DNA. You could  start the experiment practically that afternoon instead of five years  later. So, if you look back from the literature, you'll find some of the  key genes; in fact, in human biology, we're isolated by this very  painful process of positional cloning, and you hardly ever have to do  that now. It may be the odd case where something's needed, but most of  the stuff now, there are these amazing databases, and I'll give you the  URL for it at the beginning of next lecture. And I'll show you when,  this is an experiment in which someone took this gene for cystic  fibrosis.</p> <p>It is a membrane protein, and it's one of those proteins that  mediates the passage of chloride ions across the membrane. And, if that  gets broken, you end up with cystic fibrosis. What someone has done here  is they've taken that green fluorescent protein gene. And, they've  fused it to the end of the cystic fibrosis gene. So, you can tell where  the cystic fibrosis gene is localized in a lung cell by looking to see  where the fluorescence is. And, I think you can see that the  fluorescence is out there along the membrane. OK, so at the beginning of  next lecture, I'll introduce you to how we take one of these  recombinant plasmids, and make what's called a restriction map.</p> <p>It's using a very simple, little piece of apparatus like that, and  we'll go in and tell you about DNA sequencing, and this PCR technique  you've heard, preliminary chain reaction that you've heard so much  about, OK?</p>
