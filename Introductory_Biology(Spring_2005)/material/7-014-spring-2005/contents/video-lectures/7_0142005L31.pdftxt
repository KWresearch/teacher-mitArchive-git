Transcript â€“ Lecture 31 

So, for today's lecture as you can see up there is molecular -- evolution, and 
ecology. And what I mean by this, it's basically the study or what we try to figure out 
in molecular evolution and ecology is what genes or gene sequences can tell us 
about the evolution and ultimately also the ecology of organisms in the environment. 
And it's particularly relevant for thinking about microorganisms, prokaryotes and the 
environment. And  I hope I can actually convince you today of that. This is 
interesting. The top ics that I want to cover today is, first of a ll, I want to review a 
little bit what we know about life on Earth, sort of give an overview of the evolution 
of life on Earth. Then, I want to go into specific topic that's of particular relevance for 
the evolution of eukaryotes. 

That's the endosymbiosis theory. And then I'll explain how we can use gene 
sequences to actually reconstruct events that have happened a very, very long time 
ago. OK, so we'll look at what we call molecular phylogenies, with the use of gene 
sequences to reconstruct the evolutionary history of organisms on Earth. Derived 
from that, we'll look at what we call the tree of life. That's sort of the b ig p icture 
overview of the evolutionary relationships of a ll organisms on the planet. And then 
fina lly, I'll introduce you to a top ic called molecular ecology. Aga in, that's how we 
can use gene sequences to  learn something about the diversity of microorganisms in 
the environment that lead us then, next time, when I come back on Monday, into 
this big top ic of environmenta l genomics, how we can actually expand this ana lysis 
to learn much more about organisms in the environment. 

So, first of all, let's look at life on Earth. Does anybody know how old we think Earth 
is? Say aga in? Yeah, 4.5 to 4.6, I haven't my notes 4.6. So, Earth's thought to have 
orig inated about 4.6 billion years ago. When did the first solid  rocks appear on earth? 
So, when was the surface kind of solidified? Anybody know? About 3. 

9 b illion years ago, OK? And when do we think life started to develop on the p lanet? 
Any  ideas? Take a guess. Two? One? 3.5 billion years ago, OK? So, this is rea lly 
remarkable. We think  it didn't, I mean, of course it took a long time because were 
talking about millions of years and hundreds of millions of years, but still, if you look 
at the b ig p icture, it didn't actually take life that  long to evolve on the planet. So, 
why do we think that is the case? What's the evidence for that? Well, we look into 
sedimentary rocks, so old  rocks that arose from sediments, what you  find around 
this time, you find that chemicals start to appear, organic molecules that really 
resemble organic molecules in modern life. So, we have sort of chemical tracers, or 
chemical fossils. 

So, tracers that indicate the presence of organisms. But what we a lso find is so-
called micro-fossils, and I have a picture of that here where when you actually take 
rocks and actua lly slice them into very, very then slices, you can put them under 
specific microscopes. And what you then find is that many rocks that are very, very 
old, have those kinds of inclusions in them. And  these things rea lly resemble very 
much modern prokaryotic cells, modern bacteria l cells,  for examp le. And so, those 
micro-fossils are genera lly taken as an ind ication, a lso, that life is already present 

during those times. Now, when we take a quick sort of overlook of the evolution of 
life on the planet, aga in this graph here summarizes sort of the  last 4. 

6 b illion years or so when life originated. We see that there was a period of chemica l 
evolution, and then somewhere here that reg ion, it's, of course, not really well 
understood when that exactly happens, the origin of life is p laced. But I want to a lert 
you to a coup le of rea lly, rea lly critical steps here that are shown on this graph which 
we'll actua lly talk more about. It is thought that life very early on is split into three 
major lineages: the bacteria, the archaea, in what is called here nuclear line. And I'll 
come back to that in a minute or so. Then, a  further major event which you may 
remember is oxygenic photosynthesis actually evolved -- -- which means that 
cyanobacteria evolved that started to produce oxygen as a byproduct of 
photosynthesis. 

And that really fundamentally changed the chemistry of the Earth. It actually became 
an oxid izing atmosphere. And what you see here is, once the oxygen concentration 
goes over a certain level, it allowed the development of an ozone shield. Now, what 
does that mean? What was the critica l significance of the presence of an ozone 
shield? Does anybody know? What does it b lock out? Anybody remember that? 
What's the big significance of the ozone hole over Antarctica for example? It allows 
UV rad iation to heat the Earth's surface, and  in fact if there were no ozone, the UV 
radiation would be so strong that there would be no life possible on land. So, once 
the ozone shield actua lly developed, organisms could conquer, basica lly, the land's 
surface and settle on the land surface. 

In this, then, is thought to be at least correlated with the development of 
endosymb iosis. And  I'll expla in what I mean by that. But it basica lly led to the orig in 
of modern eukaryotes, so your ancestors essentially. But there was still a long time, 
obviously, until humans appeared. We have here the orig in of animals and 
metazoans, and then the age of the dinosaurs is already a very sma ll blip here on 
this graph. 

And humans don't even get featured on that because we are so recent. So, but what 
I want to show you here is that three major lineages evolved early on. These are the 
bacteria, archaea, and what we ca ll a nuclear lineage. And the significance of those 
nuclear lineages is that it basica lly combined w ith bacteria to form the modern 
eukaryotic cell. So, the eukarya, or eukaryotes they're a lso ca lled. And it was this 
combination that we called the endosymb iosis event. 

I want to explain this a little b it more, and then I'll show you finally why we actually 
know that those things are very likely to have occurred a long  time ago. Yes? It 
means the bacteria and  the nuclear lineages combine to  form a eukaryote, OK? And 
I'm actua lly going to expla in this on the slide here. So, if you have any more 
questions after that, please let me know. So, again, this shows you this early 
evolution, this early sp lit in two archaea, bacteria, and this sort of nuclear line. 

It is thought that this nuclear line, this was single celled organisms that increased in 
cell size, and then developed or partitioned the DNA into a nucleus, basically. So 
exactly how you find it in modern eukaryotic cells. But then what happened is the 
cell took up a bacteria l cell, and over time this bacteria l cell became symbiont. In 
fact it became the mitochondria. And so what this mitochondria now does in the 
moderate eukaryotic cell as you a ll know is it really took over the energy 
metabolism. So, the proto-eukaryotic cell took up a heterotrophic bacteria  that form 

the mitochondria. And this ultimately then gave rise to protozoa and to modern-day 
anima ls. 

But there was a secondary symbiotic event. This cell, once it had taken up a 
heterotrophic bacterium, it took up an autotrophic bacterium, a cyanobacterium, an 
oxygenic photosynthesizer. And this actua lly that led to the development of modern 
algae and modern p lants. So what we can say is that mitochondria our ancient 
heterotrophic bacteria -- And the chloroplasts are ancient cyanobacteria, so, 
oxygenic, photosynthetic bacteria. 

And these obviously have coevolved to then form animals and finally your plants. So 
now, obviously we are ta lking here about events that happened a very, very long 
time ago. And so,  the b ig question is really how do we really know this? But this 
takes me to the third top ic, which is that of molecular evolution. So, we can state the 
problem aga in, And that is very simp ly put, evolution is incred ibly slow, OK? And 
therefore, its processes are not directly observable. 

And we need to actua lly use inference techniques to reconstruct evolutionary 
processes. Now, what do we use when we want to reconstruct the evolutionary 
history of anima ls and plants usually? Anybody? Fossils. Exactly. So you take a 
shovel, essentia lly, and dig down into  the d ifferent layers. And there's different 
techniques that you can actually determine the age of different sedentary rocks. For 
example, and then you can construct, if you're lucky, you'll find enough  fossils of a 
particular lineage. 

You can reconstruct the evolution of the lineage. I'm sure you all have seen the 
example of the horse, for example, where we have actually quite good evidence 
when ancient horses look like. And we can reconstruct the sequence of events that 
led to the evolution of modern-day horses. Now, you can imag ine, though, that when 
we talk about such ancient events like these there really is no  fossil record. 

OK, so what people have figured out, then, is that that was really a stroke of genius 
that came about in the late 60s, that DNA molecules can act as evolutionary 
chronometers. OK, now what do I mean by that? I mean that you can take DNA 
sequences or gene sequences from different kinds of organisms. Based on those 
gene sequences you can reconstruct the relationships to each other. You can 
determine whether two organisms are closely related or whether they are only very 
distantly related. And the underlying mechanism of that, is that mutations happen 
with a certa in probability all the time. 

So, the idea is that as time passed on, DNA molecules will change. So they will 
accumulate, actually, mutations, and so this will lead to, and that the  idea is that the 
amount of change in a particular DNA sequence is proportiona l to the time of 
separate evolution of two different lineages or two different organisms. So, the 
amount is more or less proportional -- -- to time since the last common ancestry. 

So, let me exp lain how this  is actua lly done. What you really need in order to do this, 
is you need genes that are related to each other, OK? So, genes, they need to be 
universa lly d istributed. That meets a ll organisms that you want to compare need to 
have this type of gene. And, those genes need to have conserved function. In these 
genes, we can then compare to each other, and I w ill expla in how this is actually 
done. Any questions so far? OK, so the example that I actua lly want to bring is the 
16S ribosoma l RNA genes. 

We oftentimes abbreviate this rRNA. Now, does anybody remember what the 
ribosomal RNAs are and do? What's the ribosome? Yes? Right, and what does it do? 
Exactly, it's the location where messenger RNA  is translated into protein. Now, the 
ribosomal RNAs are an integra l part of the ribosome. They play both a catalytic role 
as well as a structura l role in the ribosome. And so, fundamenta lly, because this is 
such a fundamental organelle, all living organisms possess it. So, all organisms have 
it. So this allows us to use these genes to really compare all living organisms to each 
other. OK, so this  is a very  important point. I wanted to show you a, OK, if it wakes 
up. 

There we go. An examp le of these ribosoma l RNA genes, now this is actually, what 
you see here is a secondary structure of the actual RNA, the ribosoma l RNA. Now, 
these molecules have a secondary structure because they p lay a catalytic and 
structural role. And so, the really amazing thing  is when you look at the structure, 
the structure determines rea lly the function of those molecules in different 
organisms. And then look at this. 

We have here a bacterium, and here are an archaea. Now, if you think back to the 
first couple of slides, what I showed you is that those organisms have not shared a 
common evolutionary history for about four, or so, billion years, or 3 b illion years, 
excuse me. But, if you just g lance very quickly at the structures, you see that they 
look very similar to each other. So, there's an indication that the function is really 
very highly conserved of those molecules. 

However, when you actua lly look at the sequences in detail, what you'll find is that 
there's different regions. And I'd g iven some examples here denoted by A, B, C in 
those molecules. And these d ifferent reg ions of the molecules are rea lly the key to its 
usefulness in  figuring out the evolution and ecology of many organisms. The region 
number A here, or denoted by A, a sequence stretches that are the same in all living 
organisms. 

So they are universally conserved, which means that if you get a mutation  in a gene 
in that particular reg ion, you are dead. OK, that's why  it's conserved essentia lly. 
Then we have those regions B where the  length  is conserved, but the sequence is 
not. So, there are sequence change allowed, but the length needs to be conserved. 
And then there's the region C were neither length nor sequence is actually 
conserved, and where we get a lot of variation. So, let me write this down. We have 
three types of sequence stretches. We have A, what I ca lled the universa lly 
conserved sequences. 

We have B where length, but not sequence is conserved. And, we have C where 
neither length nor sequence is actua lly conserved. And the first two stretches, the 
first two types of sequence stretches, are very important in figuring out the 
phylogeny or the evolutionary relationships amongst organisms. Whereas the 
sequence stretches number C because they vary so dramatica lly, are very important 
in identifying organisms. And we'll talk more about this actually next time. 

So what can we actually know do with those sequences? Well, the first step is we 
need to generate an alignment. OK, and this is actually shown here, where each row 
denotes a gene from a particular organism. OK, so these are all abbreviated here. 
These actually aren't ribosomal RNA genes, but other genes. And that what you will 
see here is we can recognize those three d ifferent regions that I've pointed out 

before. You have the reg ions A which tell you which nucleotides line up w ith each 
other, so you use this sort of as an anchor because the sequences never vary 
amongst organisms. And that the sequence region B where you light up sequences 
that vary or stretches that vary in sequence but not in length. Now, why is this 
important? It's important because you have in each column that nucleotides that 
have originated from a common ancestra l nucleotide, and whose variation over time 
you can actua lly monitor. 

Is everybody w ith that? Any questions? OK, great. The second step, then, is the 
calculation of a similarity. And this is shown here. Aga in, we have a very simplified 
alignment now of four different organisms. Here, we have the sequences that we 
want to compare. And what you'll see is that they're overall very similar, but there 
are d ifferent sort of nucleotides. And so, what we simp ly do is for each pa ir of 
sequence combinations, we calculate the sequence similarity va lue. 

So, what you see is that you have 12 nucleotides, and the first pa ir d iffers in three 
nucleotides. OK, so that tells us, or it's ca lled actually a distance here, I'm sorry. Let 
me write this down here. It's simply one minus the similarity, of course, but so 
basically a quarter of the nucleotides d iffer where it's between A and C, a third of the 
nucleotides difference on. OK, so you do this for each pa ir of sequences, excuse me. 
The third step, then, is to ca lculate the correction for multiple mutations affecting the 
same nucleotides. 

Now, you can imagine that over time there's a probability that a particular nucleotide 
mutates, say, twice. So, in the first instance it may change from A to a G, , but then 
it changes to a C. But when you look at the modern-day sequences, you don't know 
that this actually happened. And so there's ways to statistica lly estimate what the 
likelihood is that a sequence actually contains such multip le events. OK, and this, we 
called, a corrective evolutionary distance then. 

And what you will note is that the corrected evolutionary distance is invariably larger 
than the actual observed one. Now, what can we can do w ith those d istances? We 
can constrain them into a best fit tree of relationships. So, we can draw what we ca ll 
is a best fit tree. That's shown here. We have our four organisms, but when you look 
at those branches of the tree what you'll see is that they add up  roughly to the 
correct evolutionary d istance here. So, between A and B we have 0. 

23 and 0.08, which roughly gives you 0.3 here, OK, whereas between A and C the 
tree is constrain such that we have 0.31, and here 0.15, and so overall you roughly 
get the distance here that we have ca lculated. And so what this means is that you 
ordered the organisms by their ca lculated evolutionary d istance. And so you have 
now obtained, actually, a very intuitive p icture of the relationship of organisms to 
each other where A and B are obviously the most closely related ones, and A and D 
are the most distantly related. Is everybody w ith it? Any questions? OK, now, this 
best fit tree is what we call a phylogeny. 

Now, excuse me, these techniques rea lly revolutionized the study of evolutionary 
relationships, and one of the things that it allowed us to do is to construct universal 
phylogenetic trees or what we can also ca ll the tree of life. And I w ill show you this 
on the next slide, and that I want to make a few genera l statements about this. So 
first of a ll, when you analyze all known organisms, and obviously that would be a b ig 
task, but representative of all known organisms, what you'll find is that, indeed, we 
have three major lineages: the bacteria, the archaea, and the eukarya. 

OK, so we have what we call three doma ins of life: the archaea, bacteria, and the 
eukarya. So, this really is the evidence that  life really sp lit very, very early on into 
those three  lineages that I showed you before. Interestingly, two of those major 
domains here are prokaryotic, OK? So, two of the doma ins are prokaryotes. 

Moreover, if you actually look at the types of organisms that are on here, you'll 
notice that even on the eukaryotic side of the tree, most of the organisms here are 
actually microb ial. So, the sing le celled organisms: and that means that most of the 
life on the planet is microbia l. The vast d iversity of organisms on the p lanet are 
microorganisms. So, we can say that most life is microb ial. And when you, then, look 
at ana lysis of mitochondria, and chloroplasts which a ll have their own genetic 
machinery, and therefore also their own ribosomes you'll see that the mitochondrion, 
OK, and the chloroplasts both tree within the bacteria. 

So, we really have an amazing confirmation of this endosymb iont theory which 
actually developed in the absence of gene sequences by some Russian scientists in 
the early 20th century. So, we have that mitochondria and chlorop lasts tree within 
bacteria, and this rea lly supports the endosymbiont theory. 

So really, you could say eukaryotes are really just walking, and sw imming, and flying 
incubators for bacteria, right? So, just hosts for microorganisms. OK, so basica lly you 
can, what you should take home from this is the three doma ins of life. Two are 
prokaryotic, and even more so most of the d iversity that we find is actually 
microbia l, and then  fina lly the endosymb iont theory is actually confirmed by those 
phylogenies. Now, what I want to cover in the rema ining time, is how we can 
actually use now those sequences to  learn something about organisms in the 
environment. 

That's the topic of molecular ecology. To introduce this, I just want to show you a 
coup le slides that rea lly sort of capture what the big problem is that we're facing 
here. Now, when we look at the abundance of prokaryotic cells in different types of 
environments, what we see is that there is an enormous number of different 
prokaryotes out there. This summarizes, here, d ifferent types of environments. 

We have the marine environment, freshwater environment, sediment and soils, 
subsurface sentiments and anima l guts. And that this number here g ives you the 
average number of prokaryotic cells either per milliliter or per gram. And it here we 
have the total number of cells obta ined by multiplying the average number with the 
tota l volume of the particular environment. So what you can see is that in the marine 
environment, we have an average half a million cells per milliliter of water, OK? It 
freshwater, we have about a million cells. 

What is that telling you? There's a  ton of prokaryotes out there. What you go 
swimming, you take a little gulp of water: you've probab ly eaten several million 
prokaryotes, that it's nothing to worry about because what this also tells us is that 
very, very few prokaryotes out there are really pathogens because otherw ise you'd 
be sick all the time. Now, in sediments and soils, in as little as a gram you have five 
times 10^9 prokaryotic cells a lmost. 

5 b illion prokaryotic cells are out there, and even in very, very deep sed iments that 
reach down to 3,000 m, you have a substantial number of prokaryotic cells. Well, 
and here's your guts, 10^5 times 10^6 g ives you 10^11 per gram. So aga in, you're 

just a wa lking incubator for a very complex microbial community. Here's the g lobal 
abundance. You see that steeps of surface sediments and the marine environment, 
probably in terms of numbers at least, the most important microb ial environments. 
Now, faced w ith this enormous abundance of prokaryotes out there, very important 
question is how many of them are out there? Or, how d iverse our prokaryotes in the 
environment? That's important if you want to figure out their function and the 
environment, and want to understand also their evolution. 

And what I want to show you here is that we've gone through an amazing 
development in our understanding of prokaryotic d iversity in the environment over 
the last 10 to 15 years or so. Who knows about E. 

O. Wilson here? One person? So, he wrote a very famous book on biod iversity, which 
was published  in 1988, where he tried to summarize, rea lly, how diverse the known 
organisms are on the p lanet it a lso try to extrapolate to the tota l d iversity. And what 
you see is that he came up w ith about 1.4 million different species here, mostly 
dominated by insects. That's the big section here on this p ie chart. The plants: very 
important. And if you  look, the prokaryotes feature with about 3,500 different 
species. So, in 1988 we thought there were very few prokaryotic species out there. If 
you look about 10 years into the future and take the assessment here, and this just 
exemplifies how the thinking has changed, you see that we think now that there is 
about 11 million different species out there, and that the vast majority of them are 
prokaryotic, OK, 10 million. 

So, this b ig part of the pie chart is really the prokaryotic diversity. Now, what really 
has changed is that we've actually started to use molecular techniques to determine 
the d iversity of prokaryotes in the environment. So molecular ecology is rea lly the 
use of molecular gene sequences obta ined d irectly from the environment -- -- to 
learn about the diversity prokaryotic -- -- diversity out there. 

Now, this slide just quickly summarizes this. Basica lly, the idea is that you go out 
into  the environment and collect either water or soil samples that, as I just showed 
you,  invariably conta in a lot of different prokaryotic cells. You then lyse the cells and 
purify their DNA. And so that you end up w ith a mixture of DNA that represents the 
organisms out there, and  then you can use universa l PCR primers to actually amp lify 
ribosomal RNA genes from all the organisms that are present in your samp les. Now, 
why can you use universa l PCR primers? Well, they target the reg ions number A that 
I showed you before. 

Those regions in the genes are invariant amongst all organisms. You guys a ll 
remember how the PCR works, right? We cover this. OK? Yes? No? Who doesn't? You 
don't? All right, come to the board. Just kidding. OK, you should look  it up. I don't 
have time to cover this, unfortunately, but basically it's a technique that allows you 
to amplify specific types of genes millions to b illion fold. And once you have done 
this, what you can do is that you can purify the genes on gels, and then separate 
them by cloning them into  individual plasmids. And those plasmids have been 
inserted into E. 

coli cells, and the E. coli cells are then individua lly grown up so that each culture 
contains only a sing le p lasmid, and you can then sequence these ribosomal DNAs or 
ribosomal RNA genes from those clones. And so, you have obtained a library of the 
ribosomal RNA genes from the environment. So, we use environmental ribosomal 

RNA gene libraries from which we then can actually compare how many different 
types of genes are out there. So let me show you an example of this. 

What we have done recently, we've gone out in one of the first rea lly comprehensive 
samp lings of coasta l bacteria p lankton, which means the bacteria that are present 
free living in ocean water. And so, we've done this, we've collected all those clones, 
and then basica lly we constructed those phylogenetic trees that I showed you before 
that rea lly allow us see how many different types are out there, and how closely 
related they are to one another. And what we found is that in this environment that 
you think might be very simple because it just the water column right? No, not much 
structure in there. 

We found over 1500 bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA sequences to occur, so an 
enormous diversity of prokaryotes of bacteria in that particular environment. And the 
important point is that when you actua lly look at a collection of such studies that I 
just showed you, what you  find is that the vast majority of microorganisms in the 
environment have never been cultured. So traditionally what we do of course to 
learn about microorganisms when you grow E. coli, or so, you throw them onto 
culture plates. You make lots of d ifferent cells, and that allows you to study some of 
their properties. But when you look,  for examp le, at results from the ocean, this 
summarizes now coastal and open ocean environments, again, the bacteria plankton 
is those free-floating bacteria l cells in the water. And you compare this to what we've 
actually been ab le to culture from those environments. 

What you see is that you have some dominant groups here. They have all funny 
names, most of them, because they're just clones and clone libraries. But these are 
the dominant groups that show up in clone libraries. Here's their relative 
representation in different clone libraries from a variety of environments. And so 
here you have one very important one, the SAR11 group, or this one, the SAR86, 
that always show up in clone libraries. But we've never see them in culture, so the 
important point to realize here is that what is actually happening is that whenever 
we go out, we find a great d iversity of bacteria out there, but we have no idea what 
they actua lly do. And this is one of the b ig questions that we need to answer to 
understand, rea lly, how the planet actua lly works. 

What are those uncultured microorganisms out in the environment rea lly doing, and 
what is their importance? And we'll talk about this next time. We're going to  talk 
about environmental genomics because essentia lly what we can do now, is we have 
techniques ava ilab le that allow us to isolate and  least large fragments of the 
genomes, sequence those, and look at what kinds of genes they have present. And 
that allows us, then,  to infer some of their function in the biogeochemica l cycles in 
the environment. 

OK, so w ith this I'm going to close today unless you have any more questions.
