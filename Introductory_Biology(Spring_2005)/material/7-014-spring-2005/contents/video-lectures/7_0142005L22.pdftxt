7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 22 

Just wanted to begin today by pointing out a couple of articles from today's Boston 
Globe. There's an article that's on the financia l pages about investors reconsidering 
gene therapy, and startups funded as technology evolves. A lot of you have heard 
the words gene therapy. A lot of you, at the end of that bacteria l genetics lecture, 
said you weren't quite sure what complementation was. But, gene therapy is 
basically complementation put to work. 

The idea is if you got a broken gene, and you can put in a good copy, then you'll 
take the cell back to being norma l, which  is exactly what we're doing in those phage 
crosses where we had two phage, one with the mutant copy of the gene, and one 
with the w ild type copy of the gene. And they're saying here that there's a  renewed 
interest. Now, the basic strategy in these things is to take usually a retrovirus, the 
same kind of idea that we heard about with the HIV-1 virus that will make a DNA 
copy, and then the copy gets inserted somewhere in the chromosome. 

So, the good thing is it puts in a new copy in a chromosome. The bad thing is you 
got a piece of DNA being stuck somewhere in the chromosome. And there are places 
where it can go where it doesn't matter, and there are other places where it really 
does matter. So, it's been a very tricky business with gene therapy. Part of the 
thrust here  is they're thinking that maybe they need to pick targets were the 
person's going to d ie anyway so that if there is a risk of getting cancer or something, 
it's outweighed by the possib le thing. 

That's sort of the thrust. You can see the article; it's in today's paper. It's very timely 
for what we are ta lking about now. And then on Friday I'm going to start talking 
about recombinant DNA strategies and stuff. But there's another article in today's 
paper. This is one of those things that I told you about where an article  is pub lished 
in the, in this case, online in the journal Nature. 

They have an embargo on a press thing until Thursday or so, and then the article is 
on, the hot papers that have just come out show up in the newspapers, usually 
either on Friday or Monday. And this is yet another system that they describe as 
making a molecular repair kit that corrects mutations in the cells' DNA. So far, this 
has only been done in cells. But  it's working well enough, and the article  is saying 
this approach could become a serious competitor to conventiona l gene therapy. 

In here, you have sort of a layman's account of this kind of complementation by 
gene therapy. We're ta lking about gene therapy in that field which attempts to force 
feed hea lthy genes into cells hobb led by defective ones has been plagued by failure, 
and recently was found to cause leukemia in some patients. That's probably because 
of the insertion events associated w ith these viruses. 

This new system rewrites the sma ll stretch of misspelled genetic code. That's 
typica lly the reason the gene has gone bad. So it's a different kind of strategy. This 
is the first report I've heard of that. Some of the stuff we're talking about is sort of 

inescapable because you're going to see it  in the paper. Here, they're telling you the 
sort of thing I was just saying. 

The viruses inject their payloads at random w ithin the cell's mass of DNA sometimes 
disrupting normal genes. Even when genes land in good locations, the molecular 
machinery that regulates their activity is also often thrown off, leaving the healthy 
genes operating at a level too low to be help ful or functioning in the wrong parts of 
the body. It must begin to sound  familiar. You stick a random piece of DNA 
somewhere, you can disrupt the regulation in the gene as well as just landing in the 
open reading  frame. 

So there's a problem w ith gene therapy. Now, they'd like to make you think that this 
is going to be the promise to everything, but as always it's more complicated. And 
so, I just p icked up the last paragraph of this article. Other scientists sa id the 
approach looked promising, but predicted it would end up struggling with this 
problem of its own, James M. W ilson, a gene therapy researcher at the University of 
Pennsylvania. 

Now, there's somebody who's in a position to criticize, but also has a vested interest 
himself in the a lternative therapy, noted that the first step of the new process causes 
for z inc fingers. It's a kind of protein that's  involved  in this, to make a  fresh break in 
DNA to accommodate the insertion of the corrected sequence. It's the same kind of 
break with radiation that can lead to cancer. And we're going to ta lk today about, 
you'll see where double-stranded breaks and whatnot can be a  real problem in terms 
of the integrity of the DNA and genome stab ility, which is maintaining gene stability 
so important in avoid ing cancer. 

You guys are a tough crowd. Comments ranged  from, this was the best lecture that 
I'd g iven to ones that were absolutely the other end of the spectrum. You're a very 
hard group. I truly am going to take, I don't have time really to sit back and redo a ll 
my lectures, but I've a huge amount of input, and I'm going to go back over all this 
input I'm getting, and take it very seriously in terms of how I go about things next 
year. 

I can see a number of changes I'm going to make. Whoever sent me the e-mail that 
talked about the Dock Street Bohemian Pilsner brewed in Utica, NY, this classic 
golden Pilsner, pungent, perfumy taste and so on, it was a moment of lightness, but 
if I got too many things like that it's not going to help me  in trying to figure out how 
to do. For the person who asked about how  to avoid accidenta l pollination, when 
they're going to do that, they actually take the stamens off the flowers so you don't 
get accidenta l self fertilization. 

You actua lly go out and make ones that are just ma le or just fema le flowers. You can 
do that rather easily. OK, so what we got into last time, or what I told you last time, 
and I promise you that there's another Mendel lecture coming. For those of you who 
thought this was a little slow, you may find the next one is all too  fast. But anyway, 
that will be how it goes. 

Mendel had carried out this fundamental series of experiments. And  I d id linger over 
it because I think it's so simp le you can actua lly see the scientific process  in action, 
and it also isn't complicated by any techniques that we can't see. And it was a 
tremendously important insight that genetic information came in units. But as I told 

you,  it wasn't accepted because for most of the world at the time, it was a statistica l 
argument. 

There weren't any entities that were two of inside a cell, and a ll that sort of thing. 
So, it didn't take over scientific thinking. It wasn't until about 1900 when severa l 
other geneticists did fina lly find systems that duplicated Mendel's results, and 
therefore showed that these were general inferences, something that Mendel 
himself, as I told you, by choosing weeds and bees as follow-up systems hadn't been 
able to do. 

These other geneticists showed them in other systems. But the other thing that 
made the d ifference at the time, was by this point cytolog ists, who were looking at 
cells under microscopes, had found entities whose behavior seemed to match those 
of these particles of information that Mendel had postulated to exp lain these patterns 
of inheritance that he was seeing. These particles, because they were ca lled 
chromosomes, which litera lly means colored things, the reason they were colored 
was not because they were inherently colored, but because cytolog ists were sta ining 
the cells w ith a variety of things. 

And that was what a llowed them to visua lize these. And so, by staring into 
microscopes, right around this time, around the turn of the century, 1900s or so, 
cytologists had come up with three key observations. One was that chromosomes 
came in matched pairs. So, let's say  in this cell, there were too long and too short. 
So that's a chromosome. And it corresponds, we now know, to a double-stranded 
DNA molecule that's been all condensed up. 

And there are two copies of each chromosome in this thing. So: two long, two short, 
one came from mom, one came from dad. And for bookkeep ing purposes, I'm going 
to color them so that from one parent is unshaded, and the other one is shaded. 
Most of you know in human cells we have 23 pairs of chromosomes. This is a now 
fancier method of visua lizing chromosomes called painting chromosomes where you 
take little stretches of DNA that are unique to particular sequences, attach dyes, and 
then use them to sta in the cells, and so they will color only particular chromosomes. 

And we have 22 pa irs of identica l chromosomes, and then the sex chromosomes 
here, X and Y, this would be a ma le, or two X's if we were . We'll return to those in 
the next  lecture. Kim Nasmyth, who spent his life working on how these 
chromosomes segregate gave a talk a year ago. He's in London at a hospital in 
London. And then he brought in the next slide. There was an artist who spent severa l 
months visiting w ith him, trying to  find ways to represent  in art some of what she 
saw going on. 

And I thought you might enjoy seeing this, the slide. This is the human complement 
of chromosomes, represented in stripy socks that various staff members from the 
hosp ita l brought in for her to do this. So, a little touch of scientist humor which some 
of you may think is pretty nerdy, but anyway there it was for what it's worth. He 
showed that in our departmenta l colloquium. 

OK, the second thing, then, that the cytolog ists noted by staring at this was during 
ordinary cell division, which gives two identica l daughters the numbers of 
chromosomes per cell is preserved. And this ord inary cell division is given a special 
name of mitosis. So if we take this cell, the first thing that happens, then, is the 

chromosomes are dup licated. We've ta lked a lot about DNA synthesis at the 
molecular level. 

This is looking at it. Excuse me, and so, there are now two DNA molecules, that each 
one of these new DNA molecules is g iven a special name. This is ca lled a chromatid. 
So there was one DNA molecule here. It's now duplicated, but you'll notice these are 
still joined together. The point at which they are joined together is known as the 
centromere. And then, after this, after the DNA's been copied, these things are lined 
up at the center of the cell and then they are pulled apart to g ive two daughter cells 
that are just like what you started with. 

This part, so this is 2N, if N is the number of kinds of chromosomes. And  then there's 
two each. This is 2N. At this point, the DNA contents of the cell is 4N. This is 2N. This 
is 2N. We're back to where we started. This part was  invisib le to the cytolog ists, at 
least in the sense the chromosomes at this point are extended. And so, they weren't 
able to visua lize them by looking through the microscope. 

But as it came time for cell division, then the chromosomes condensed up very 
tightly. This is probably to avoid  tangles. And you need to pull them apart into the 
two daughter cells. And  then the part that you could see, this was known as mitosis, 
this process by which the chromosomes are pulled apart. So, mitosis  is a mechanism 
for nuclear d ivision that results  in two daughters with identical genetic information. 

When you contrast this to meiosis, which I'll show you in just a minute, this has been 
stud ied for years in a kind of observation way. I showed you at some point. This is 
an anima l cell where the chromosomes line up, and then they pull apart. I think I 
showed you, and you can see the cells divide once they've done that. I'm going to 
show you this next thing, which everything happens more slow motion. 

This is a p icture of the b lood lily, so it's a p lant. Again, the choice of model system is 
often, if it has a  feature that is good for a particular thing. This happens, very easy 
to visualize in these lily cells. Now here, the cells have dup licated their 
chromosomes, and the daughter chromosomes are held together. They're glued 
together, so you can tell in this thing that they've been glued. Now, in order to 
separate the first thing they have to do is line up at the equator of the cell. 

And then it pulls apart and you can see that each daughter cell gets one of the 
duplicated chromosomes. OK, so that's mitosis. It generates two cop ies of what you 
started with. The other observation that the cytologists made was that cell d ivisions 
that produce sex cells work by a d ifferent system. So, the third thing, And, I'm going 
to g ive you the scientific word now for sex cells. 

So, they're usually called gametes. General term, so that would be sperm and egg, 
or pollen would be a kind of gamete. In this process, the number of chromosomes is 
halved. And this special type of cell division is known as meiosis. It's very important, 
because if we d idn't have meiosis we wouldn't have any progeny. We need to be ab le 
to cut the number of chromosomes we have per cell in half, so as Mendel inferred, 
then when each parent made a contribution you'd be back up to the right number of 
cells. 

Now, so this process begins again by duplication of the DNA. So this would be 2N. 
Now we go to, as before, with one interesting difference here. So we are at 4N in the 
cell. But you notice that I've drawn these dup licated chromosomes with chromatids 

overlapping. This point of, I d idn't do  this too well. The point of connection: where 
the two chromosomes overlap is known as the chiasma. 

It's a point of actua l physica l interaction between the chromosomes. And what it 
allows the cell to do  is to have the two homologous chromosomes, in this case the 
two long ones,  find each other, and actually physically interact. That's a critical event 
for the next step that I'm going to show you. It's a lso a point, which you'll see in the 
next lecture, there is additional genetic diversity introduced into the system. So, at 
this point, what's happened is that the DNA has doubled, at this point, looks sort of 
like mitosis except for the fact that the duplicated chromatids have overlapped. 

There's a least one of these for every pair of duplicated chromosomes. So what 
happens in the next phase, which is known as meiosis I is that the pairs of 
duplicated chromosomes are separated. So, we get two cells. We might get, say, the 
unshaded of this one and the shaded of the little guys. And the other one then is 
shaded with a  long one and unshaded w ith this one. This  is 2N, and this is 2N. But  if 
you'll take a look at what's happening over here, you will see that we don't have the 
same thing going on. 

In that case, we were producing identical copies of the starting cell. In this case, 
we've got something different now because we've separated both cop ies of, let's say, 
the chromosome from dad from both cop ies of the chromosome that originated with 
mom, and the other way over here. These, then, undergo a second round that's 
known as meiosis II, which resemb les now mitosis in the sense that the duplicated 
chromatids are now pulled apart into daughter cells so that this one w ill generate 
one  long, unshaded one, one short, and there w ill be two of those. 

In the cell, it will generate a shaded long and unshaded like that. So now, there are 
four of these. And you'll notice that there is now an N. So, we ha lved the number of 
chromosomes during meiosis via a process by two rounds of division. The other thing 
you can think of  is you can beg in to see, at least, when the evolution of sex was such 
a powerful force in driving evolution by introducing so much variation, because each 
of us has a copy of each of our 22 chromosomes where we have homologous pa irs, 
one from mom, one from dad. 

That every time we make a sex cell, a sperm or an egg, what happens is for 
chromosome 1, you can either get a copy from mom or the copy from dad. And then 
the next one: copy from mom, copy from dad, and so on. You can see the variation 
is possible just from that part of the process a lone. And there's going to be more 
variation that comes about from events that happen where this chiasma is as I'll 
show you. 

So, meiosis then, as I sa id, is a mechanism  for nuclear d ivision that produces four 
daughter cells w ith ha lf the genetic info of the orig inal. So, how d id I write that? And 
in this case, the daughters are not identica l. Does somebody have a question? Yeah? 
Oh, this part of the process, the cytologists broke this down when they were 
observing. So, it was a part they couldn't see. 

When they started to be able to see it, they first saw  this one division, and then the 
second d ivision. They ca lled the first round of division of meiosis I, and the second 
meiosis 2. So it was just a name given to the process. Yeah? Oh, sorry, excuse me, I 
see the prob lem. OK, it goes this way. This period of time is called meiosis I. That 
part of the process is called meiosis I, meiosis II, sorry. 

Yeah, I mean what I wrote down as arb itrary. You could've had 2 from mom, and 2 
from dad. And in fact, I guess if we have 22 pairs we could eventually have a sperm 
or egg that had all of the cop ies from mom, and all of the copies from dad. You could 
calculate the statistical chances of that happening, but what you'll discover as we'll 
find next time, is that even if you did that the chromosomes would no longer be 
identica l to what you got from mom or dad, because there's a little bit of genetic 
recombination going on during that process. 

I'll a lso show in a minute that you can get errors in this process, and  that these are 
important. So, what happens then is that fertilization, what the cytologists can see 
happened was that the number of chromosomes have been ha lved. So, you had N 
plus N giving you 2N where this might be, for example, the egg, and this might be 
the sperm, since gametes have ha lf the number of genetic content when they fuse, 
then you go back to the origina l number. 

And this gave rise to what was known as the chromosomal theory of inheritance. 
Even though cytologists didn't know what these colored things were,  they seemed to 
have the properties that you would expect the carriers of the genetic information to 
have. Be duplicated before a cell was going to d ivide and then they seemed to be 
very precisely segregated so that each daughter cell got one copy. 

And it made sense,  then, in terms of the formation of sex cells you'd have, and then 
it would a ll come back up. So, the cytolog ists proposed this chromosomal theory of 
inheritance. Chromosomes were the carriers that carried the genetic information. 
And you can see now that Mendel's work was rediscovered, which is more or less 
what happens around 1900, how beautifully  it mapped on top of this because the 
genetic information came in particles. 

You'd think, oh, well those particles are sitting on those chromosomes. They get 
duplicated. They get separated. They get d ivided in ha lf. Their number gets divided 
in half when you make sex cells. So, I want to at least point out, let me go onto this 
next thing here. Here was one other picture I'd shown you. This was a cancer cell 
divid ing again. 

We see the same process at work. And that just reminds you, when I was ta lking 
about that kind of process, trying to remind you that one cell gives rise to two cells, 
and one DNA molecule gives rise to two DNA molecules. But these phenomena are 
related even though one ta lks about them in d ifferent parts of the courses, and if 
you've got more than one DNA molecule per cell, then each one's a chromosome. 
And then you have to take care of segregating those as well. 

But a point that I'd made is that up until this part to the right could be a yeast or an 
E. coli, but if it's going to be someone, something more comp licated that's got 
different kinds of cells like us, then we have these ultimately, an adult human with 
10^14 cell. So, this process has happened over, and over, and over aga in. And it has 
to be rea lly very accurate. And, there was remarkab le advances have been made in 
understanding this process over the last few years. 

And a  lot of this was due to the work of Lee Hartwell, who carried out experiments, I 
guess, that offered some key insights into the basis of the whole cell cycle, of which 
this is just part. So they said, here we can't really see all of this stuff in the 

microscope. What cytolog ists were ab le to observe was that after the chromosomes 
had dup licated, then they condensed up. 

They became visible, and they could see that part of the system. So, a great body of 
know ledge has been learned over the past few years. Lee Hartwell, who was a 
postdoc at MIT w ith Boris Magasanik a number of years ago, was one of the key 
people who led to this round of insights. And what we now know, the cell cycle can 
be basica lly d ivided into four parts. So a new ly born cell, if you will, undergoes 
what's known as phase of the cell cycle that's known as the G1 phase. 

And you could think of this as, amongst other things, sort of preparation  for 
duplicating the cell's DNA. And then, there's a phase known as the S-phase, which is 
when DNA synthesis takes place. That now gives the cell an information content of 
4N. There was then another phase known as G2, which you could think of as 
preparation for pulling the chromosomes apart, and for the cell dividing. 

And that's known as mitosis. And so, this is quite remarkable. It's quite fundamental. 
It's a very elegant and very comp lex system of controls. And what Lee learned is 
that there is an elaborate system of what we now know as checkpoints in the cell 
cycle. And the idea is pretty much the same sort of thing that you might do if you 
were an eng ineer and you were setting up a qua lity control process that involved a 
series of stages. 

And what a checkpoint does is it basically demands successful completion of a prior 
phase before the system is permitted to move to the next stage. And you can sort of 
see the prob lem here, that if you are trying to, say you're copying your chromosome, 
your DNA, and you only got part way through. And then you proceeded to the part 
where you pulled the chromosomes apart. There would be all kinds of chaos inside of 
the cells because you would be breaking chromosomes. 

You wouldn't be getting  identica l information. And there are three major checkpoints. 
There  is a checkpoint at the G1/S boundary. There is actua lly more than one. But 
there's an intra-S phase checkpoint, and then there's another one at the G2/M 
boundary as well. And the way that Lee found this out, I wanted to just take you 
back because remember when I was talking, well, first we ta lked about how would 
you get a mutant affecting an essentia l cell, a gene whose function is essential for 
the cell. 

We sa id you'd have to be cond itional  in some kind of way, because the organism 
would be dead, and couldn't use genetics to study it. So, when I introduced you to 
those phage, and we wanted to study critical functions needed for phage growth, we 
needed a cond itiona l mutant. Remember, we did look for temperature sensitive 
mutants. So that's what Lee Hartwell started to do with yeast  in 1970 approximately. 

He just looked for mutations that were temperature sensitive lethals in yeast. Now, 
yeast can be d iploid, but they also can be haploid, which is just one copy of genetic 
information. So just like a bacterium, haploid yeast, if you get a mutation affecting a 
gene, then you see its phenotype right away because there  isn't a complication of 
the second chromosome. And Lee got the Nobel Prize for his work, just, I forget, 
three years ago or a short time ago anyway. 

And so, this was the process he was studying. I showed you this movie. In this case, 
this is budding yeast, and you can see why it's called budding yeast is that rather 

than the still grow ing and segregating down the middle, the daughter cells grow as 
little buds coming off the side. The DNA is still going to be duplicated as we got, and 
then segregated into the daughter. So that part of the process is there, but there's 
yeast grow ing sped up a b it so you can see it. 

So, what Lee found was that when he looked at his TS mutants, he found that they 
tended to arrest at characteristic stages, and he was ab le,  then, to figure out that 
there must be some sort of checkpoint system  that is something went wrong during 
one of the stages, then the cells with all p ile up at a particular characteristic stage in 
the cell cycle. And this was controlled by these checkpoints. 

These checkpoints are of enormous importance because if something goes wrong 
with them, as happens often in cancer cells, then you get a huge increase in 
instability of the genome very similar to the way, losing, for examp le, mismatch 
repair causes instab ility of the genome and therefore things that can cause a cell to 
forget to divide when  it stopped d ividing when it hits its neighbors, which part of the 
cell it belongs to and so on. 

Those kinds of changes w ill come w ith much greater frequency. Another thing that 
was completely remarkable was because  it was yeast it was relatively easy to find 
genes that were broken. Going back to complementation, leaving aside the 
technicalities, if we had a mutant that's a TS lethal and it's dead, if we put in a good 
copy we'll know it because the cell won't die at a high temperature anymore. 

So, you can sort of see from the first principle it was relatively stra ightforward to find 
the genes in yeast that are necessary for cell cycle control. The remarkable thing is 
that they've been conserved all the way up to humans that the proteins that are 
involved in the cell cycle control are virtually identical in humans. So, the system, 
again, is probab ly locked into place because it works so well. 

And once it was working, then evolution didn't have a lot of space. I won't say it's 
completely identical in human cells, for example, have a  few more wrinkles that they 
throw in. And fundamenta lly, you can see evolutionarily that the system evolved 
once. One thing I just want to comment on, and here's just an examp le of the sort of 
thing that can happen if you get a problem with pulling chromosomes apart when 
they're not ready, or something happens that make a break in a chromosome. 

You will get a double strand break, and cells don't like that, and they try and fix it 
up. I think in this case, you can see that chromosome 9 has picked up a piece of a 
coup le of other chromosomes. This piece here came from chromosome 8 over here, 
and this piece here came from chromosome 22. And so, this cell now has things kind 
of messed up. And this particular chromosome's got parts of two other 
chromosomes. 

And so, you can start to think about the consequences of that. You'll see when you 
start segregating chromosomes, there are issues. And also, the junctions themselves 
can sometimes do things like creating fusion proteins that have aberrant properties, 
for examp le, a signaling molecule that's now locked permanently into the on position 
or something like that. 

Those sorts of things can happen by these as well. So, here's a very abbreviated 
form, the principal that happens, or what happens so that the chromosomes become 
visib le  in the microscope. There is about a coup le of meters of DNA in every human 

cell. So, you can see a lmost from first principles, it a lmost has to be packaged in 
some way to fit in that little, tiny area. 

And down at the basic level, the DNA is looped around a little cluster of proteins 
called histones. And then, as the cells approach the mitotic stage, they package 
these and higher, and higher, and higher levels of packaging so that the 
chromosomes get more and more compact, and therefore less like spaghetti, and 
less likely to get tang led when they are pulled apart. Now, this teaching as part of 
the course. 

It's in the book. It's a little like glycolysis, though, and there's so much deta il. It's 
hard to notice at all. And what I've tried to do here is just sort of take a step back, 
focus you on the rea lly big parts of the process. But you can see this is a sort of 
typica l textbook thing showing you the various sub stages of this process that 
cytologists have g iven names to each part of this. 

For example, you can see the chromosomes lining up at the equatoria l phase just 
before they're going to be pulled apart. One little detail which I glossed over at this 
point as you can see that the chromosomes are, of course, surrounded by the 
nuclear membrane. And, at least in many cells, what happens is just before the 
chromosomes are going to be pulled apart, this nuclear membrane in a matter of 20 
or 30 seconds goes from being a membrane  into sort of breaking into a whole  little 
series of membrane sacs. 

And then, after the chromosomes have pulled apart, now you reassemble the nuclear 
membrane around each set of chromosomes. And I think there's still an awful lot to 
be learned about how that particular trick is done. And that's a textbook diagram. 
These are the kinds of things the cytologists were looking at as they were describ ing 
it. And one thing you can certainly see, I think, is that there are a lot of, if you want 
to think of them as cables, this whole process is done by molecular machinery. 

And in  fact, one of the key things for ensuring that the chromosomes are all  lined up 
is each are attached to each pole of the cell. So, an ind ividua l chromosome feels 
tension on both sides, and there's pretty good evidence at this point that says that 
what has to happen before mitosis is allowed to proceed is that each dup licated 
chromosome must feel the tension on both sides. And if one of them  is only attached 
on one side,  it's not a llowed to go ahead. 

Here are a couple more pictures. The chromosomes are in b lue, and all this cabling is 
in green. You can see a molecular machine's basica lly at work. And I wanted to show 
you this picture because this is important. There's two parts to this. Julia, could you 
hit? So,  this is a norma l mitosis. These are in lung cells from a newt, which are very 
flat. So it's easy to visua lize them. I believe this is by Nomarski, a kind of optics 
called Nomarksi optics. 

What they're doing,  the duplicated chromosomes are getting lined up at the 
equatoria l position in the cell, and you get a spindle attached to one side, and then a 
spind le attached to the other. And once that's happened, then you can see the 
chromosomes. Watch this one over here, for example. It just got attached, and it's 
being pulled into the middle. And once the cells feel that a ll the tension, there's 
tension on a ll of them, and then it enables the next stage of the process. 

And you w ill see each of the daughter chromatids segregate before. And, I just want 
to impress upon you it's comp licated enough just replicating the DNA at the fidelity 
we talked about. An aw ful lot of other stuff has to go on. And it would be a 
reasonable question: is there ever a mistake? And there is. This one actua lly shows 
another cell where there's going to be a mistake. 

You can't see it yet, but you can see the chromosomes are all condensed up. And 
they are beginning to get these spindles attached. And as they get attached to the 
site then they get localized in the central part right down the equatorial p lane of the 
cell. But, I think you'll start to see the problem emerging at the moment. I think it's 
going to be this guy right here. 

I think a little arrow will probably appear before too long. But what's happened is this 
one didn't get properly connected on both sides. But, the cell's going to go ahead 
anyway. Watch. The one up here  is going to get pulled in. There it goes. It's getting 
pulled in. And then, once it's in there, then the cell is going to go ahead and divide 
anyway. So you can see what the prob lem is. 

This one's got two over here, and this one over here is missing it. This process is 
known as non-disjunction. This is the sort of thing that happens in cancer cells that 
have broken, where the checkpoint gene is broken. And then, if you have that, then 
the cells go on. The same problem happens in meiosis, and it's up here. It's the 
same princip le that  if you end up with, if you don't segregate the cells, the 
chromosomes correctly, then you can end up w ith a sex cell that has two copies of 
one of them. 

And the other one has none. And if you have two copies, or 2N plus 1N, then you 
end up with a trisomy. And if you have zero plus N, you end up w ith what's known as 
a monosomy. So, these would be from defects in meiosis. I'll just close by saying the 
one that you probably have heard of is Down's Syndrome which  is trisomy 21. That 
comes about from this sort of process. 

It's a very deb ilitating genetic deficiency. Most of you are probably familiar w ith  it. 
This process happens. Things go wrong at meiosis, about one in every fifth 
detectab le human pregnancy doesn't go to completion for the most part because of 
an underlying problem like this, that the body is set up to need the pa irs of each 
chromosome. If you have one too many or one too few it's usua lly letha l. 

So, if one in every five human pregnancies has that happened, you end up w ith a 
miscarriage. My w ife and  I have been through it. It's a devastating experience. I 
think you can just look around and figure the odds. A significant number of the 
people in this room are going to have to cope with this. And I'm just bring ing this up 
for your attention right now is it something that  in our society we tend not to ta lk 
about very much unless maybe you're a Hollywood movie star and it makes it into 
the tabloids or something. 

But it's a very common human experience, and very difficult to cope w ith. But there 
it is, for most of those pregnancies that terminate very early, usua lly the underlying 
cause is a problem  that traces back to the kind of stuff we see here where something 
went wrong during the segregation process of making the sex cells. And as I say, if it 
happens in just our ordinary cells, that's one of the thinks that leads the progression 
to cancer. 

OK, so I'll see you on Wednesday.
