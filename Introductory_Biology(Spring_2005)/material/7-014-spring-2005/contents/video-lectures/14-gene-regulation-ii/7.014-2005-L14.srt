1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:05
There were some other questions sort
of running along this general idea

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:10
of the fact that the information in
DNA doesn't go,

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:15
even though it encodes the
information for proteins goes via

4
00:00:15 --> 00:00:21
this rRNA intermediate.
Someone asked what was the M.

5
00:00:21 --> 00:00:25
The M is for messenger.
The idea being that since the DNA,

6
00:00:25 --> 00:00:29
at least in eukaryotes the DNA was
in the nucleus and proteins were

7
00:00:29 --> 00:00:33
made out of the cytoplasm,
somehow that information had to be

8
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
carried from the nucleus where the
DNA was out to the cytoplasm.

9
00:00:36 --> 00:00:40
And that's where the term messenger
was because the RNA was seen as

10
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
something that would carry the
information out.

11
00:00:43 --> 00:00:47
Now, a point here,
it's really critical because we're

12
00:00:47 --> 00:00:51
going to continue to talk
about gene regulation.

13
00:00:51 --> 00:00:56
And that is when a cell is making
one of these mRNAs,

14
00:00:56 --> 00:01:01
it doesn't make one single copy of
all of the genes that are in the

15
00:01:01 --> 00:01:06
genome on one RNA.
Instead it does it either one gene

16
00:01:06 --> 00:01:11
at a time, which is the usual case,
or occasionally as we see in the lac

17
00:01:11 --> 00:01:16
operon a little tiny cluster of DNAs
that have related functions.

18
00:01:16 --> 00:01:22
And the beauty of that is that it
then enables the cell to dial in how

19
00:01:22 --> 00:01:27
much protein is being made,
in part at least, by determining how

20
00:01:27 --> 00:01:31
much RNA is being made.
So you're going to make no RNA and

21
00:01:31 --> 00:01:35
not make the protein at all or make
a little RNA and get a little

22
00:01:35 --> 00:01:39
protein, or if it's really a thing
you need very large quantities of

23
00:01:39 --> 00:01:43
you can really crank out a lot of
RNA and make a lot of protein.

24
00:01:43 --> 00:01:46
So the potential is there for
regulation.  And in bacteria,

25
00:01:46 --> 00:01:50
as I said, for almost all bacterial
genes it's pretty straightforward.

26
00:01:50 --> 00:01:54
You can look in the DNA, and at
least if you know where to start,

27
00:01:54 --> 00:01:58
see the start of a protein, you can
just use that table of the genetic

28
00:01:58 --> 00:02:02
code and read off the sequence.
But eukaryotes in particular,

29
00:02:02 --> 00:02:08
higher eukaryotes have this odd
business that what seemed odd and

30
00:02:08 --> 00:02:13
surprising that when you look at
their genes, many of them you cannot

31
00:02:13 --> 00:02:19
do that because it's as if there are
extra bits of DNA stuck in the

32
00:02:19 --> 00:02:24
middle.  And in some cases you heard
it could be really huge amounts of

33
00:02:24 --> 00:02:30
DNA so that there is this extra
thing where there's a pre-mRNA.

34
00:02:30 --> 00:02:35
And this RNA splicing we talked
about has to take place to generate

35
00:02:35 --> 00:02:41
the mRNA.  And once you have the
mRNA then the ribosome and the

36
00:02:41 --> 00:02:46
charge tRNAs can be used to make the
proteins.  And someone asked what

37
00:02:46 --> 00:02:52
all that extra DNA is for.
I mean we still don't fully

38
00:02:52 --> 00:02:57
understand that.
There are some regulatory sequences

39
00:02:57 --> 00:03:03
and regulatory actors that are
buried in that non-coding DNA.

40
00:03:03 --> 00:03:07
But another thing may be that this
is just the way it's worked in

41
00:03:07 --> 00:03:11
evolution.  And as long as it works
there's no driving force necessarily

42
00:03:11 --> 00:03:15
to get rid of it.
If you look at microorganisms,

43
00:03:15 --> 00:03:20
for example, yeast is a eukaryotic
that, like E. coli,

44
00:03:20 --> 00:03:24
has to replicate pretty fast in
order to compete with other

45
00:03:24 --> 00:03:29
microorganisms for the food and
whatnot in its environment.

46
00:03:29 --> 00:03:33
And it has relatively little of
these extra intervening sequences

47
00:03:33 --> 00:03:38
compared to what we find in our DNA.
I gave you the example of Factor 8.

48
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
It didn't really particularly
matter what it was in the sense that

49
00:03:42 --> 00:03:47
it was just an example of something
that has a lot of intervening

50
00:03:47 --> 00:03:52
sequence.  What it is,
though, it's one of a set of

51
00:03:52 --> 00:03:57
proteins that are involved in
clotting of your blood.

52
00:03:57 --> 00:04:02
When you cut yourself,
we have this system that prevents us

53
00:04:02 --> 00:04:07
from bleeding to death,
unless you have hemophilia or

54
00:04:07 --> 00:04:12
something like that where's there's
a problem with the clotting system,

55
00:04:12 --> 00:04:17
then a very complex set of things
happen.  And Factor 8 is one of the

56
00:04:17 --> 00:04:22
several proteins that play critical
roles in that.

57
00:04:22 --> 00:04:27
Somebody asked,
I talked about a few things that

58
00:04:27 --> 00:04:32
were, this was sort of the dogma.
This was how information was thought

59
00:04:32 --> 00:04:37
to go.  And then how Dave Baltimore
found there was reverse

60
00:04:37 --> 00:04:42
transcriptase that could take an RNA
and make a DNA copy.

61
00:04:42 --> 00:04:47
And the question was they didn't
understand how the dogma could

62
00:04:47 --> 00:04:52
change.  I mean that's sort of what
I'm trying to emphasize a lot in

63
00:04:52 --> 00:04:57
this course is what I'm teaching you
is what human experimentation and

64
00:04:57 --> 00:05:02
thought has brought up until spring
of 2005 of terms in biology.

65
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
Some of the sort of basic
discoveries were made in physics so

66
00:05:05 --> 00:05:09
long ago that it's very unlikely
that you'll come in and discover

67
00:05:09 --> 00:05:13
that the Newtonian mechanics you
learned as a freshman is not

68
00:05:13 --> 00:05:17
operative anymore when you're a
senior, but you can still have these

69
00:05:17 --> 00:05:21
massive revolutions in biology where
just suddenly whole things,

70
00:05:21 --> 00:05:25
like RNA splicing, emerge from the
woodwork almost overnight.

71
00:05:25 --> 00:05:29
And that's, in fact, what happened
with that.  That's what happened

72
00:05:29 --> 00:05:32
with reverse transcriptase.
So, in a sense,

73
00:05:32 --> 00:05:36
it's almost a joke that Crick called
it dogma.  He didn't know what he

74
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
was doing.  But it sort of took that
property on.  And I'm trying to

75
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
caution you that even though some of
you would like me to stick to just

76
00:05:43 --> 00:05:46
facts that we're continually
learning and there are discoveries

77
00:05:46 --> 00:05:50
being made even as we're going on
with this course.

78
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
Now, I told you that there were
certain viruses,

79
00:05:53 --> 00:05:57
HIV being the one I really
emphasized, that have

80
00:05:57 --> 00:06:01
this property.
Their genetic material is not DNA.

81
00:06:01 --> 00:06:05
It's RNA.  And the reverse
transcriptase makes a double-strand

82
00:06:05 --> 00:06:09
copy that it inserts into the
organism's DNA and becomes a

83
00:06:09 --> 00:06:13
permanent part.
And I'm trying to caution you

84
00:06:13 --> 00:06:18
that's why safe sex is such a big
deal.  Because if you get infected

85
00:06:18 --> 00:06:22
with HIV you'll have it for the rest
of your life.  I mentioned there

86
00:06:22 --> 00:06:26
were some cancer viruses,
and someone said, well, if you do

87
00:06:26 --> 00:06:31
that how can you cure cancer?
Well, in fact,

88
00:06:31 --> 00:06:35
we're lucky in the sense that we
don't have to contend at this point

89
00:06:35 --> 00:06:40
in a major way with human cancer
viruses, that would be more of a

90
00:06:40 --> 00:06:44
problem, but your cats have to.
You may have heard of the feline

91
00:06:44 --> 00:06:48
leukemia virus.
This is a retrovirus of this same

92
00:06:48 --> 00:06:53
class, and cats infected with it
have it in their saliva.

93
00:06:53 --> 00:06:57
And although it can be transmitted
amongst pets in the same household,

94
00:06:57 --> 00:07:02
the big problem is usually cat
fights.

95
00:07:02 --> 00:07:05
And then you get a scratch and then
it gets in.  So if you have a cat

96
00:07:05 --> 00:07:09
you probably had to take it to the
vet and get vaccinated.

97
00:07:09 --> 00:07:13
And one of the reasons is you're
trying to get it vaccinated against

98
00:07:13 --> 00:07:17
the feline leukemia virus.
And it's just sort of like that

99
00:07:17 --> 00:07:21
story I told you with the
streptococcus,

100
00:07:21 --> 00:07:25
that if your immune system has seen
the thing beforehand then if you

101
00:07:25 --> 00:07:29
actually get an infection it has a
very quick response and your cat

102
00:07:29 --> 00:07:33
doesn't get infected by the virus.
And therefore doesn't become a

103
00:07:33 --> 00:07:37
candidate for getting leukemia in
later life.  OK.

104
00:07:37 --> 00:07:41
So at least there's an effort to
try and response to at least a few

105
00:07:41 --> 00:07:45
of the things.
There were some very interesting

106
00:07:45 --> 00:07:50
and thoughtful questions.
So I want to now go back to talk a

107
00:07:50 --> 00:07:54
little bit more about this issue of
regulation because that is one of

108
00:07:54 --> 00:07:58
the real secrets to life.
And it's the ability of organisms

109
00:07:58 --> 00:08:02
to turn on and off certain functions
and to have rheostats where the can

110
00:08:02 --> 00:08:07
control the levels of expression.
But all of this has to be in the DNA.

111
00:08:07 --> 00:08:11
And so before people knew how this
worked, it's a little mysterious.

112
00:08:11 --> 00:08:16
And maybe one way you might think
about it, well,

113
00:08:16 --> 00:08:20
if I have a gene that encodes
something for lactose metabolism,

114
00:08:20 --> 00:08:25
and I tell you there's a sequence
upstream of this and somehow this

115
00:08:25 --> 00:08:29
gene is regulated depending on
whether I put lactose in the medium

116
00:08:29 --> 00:08:34
or not, how is it going to work?
Does it have to fit into little

117
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
holes in between the letters of the
genetic code sort of the way Gamov

118
00:08:38 --> 00:08:43
originally thought about it,
or is there some other mechanism?

119
00:08:43 --> 00:08:47
And what you'll see here is one of
the general strategies that

120
00:08:47 --> 00:08:52
evolution has chosen is although
there's regulatory information in

121
00:08:52 --> 00:08:56
the DNA, DNA isn't a particularly
good molecule for recognizing things,

122
00:08:56 --> 00:09:01
but what it is good at
is encoding proteins.

123
00:09:01 --> 00:09:06
So the trick is to have some
proteins made whose role in life are

124
00:09:06 --> 00:09:11
to be regulators.
So that this is what is underlying

125
00:09:11 --> 00:09:17
this system that I started to tell
you about on Friday.

126
00:09:17 --> 00:09:28
So remember --

127
00:09:28 --> 00:09:33
-- beta-galactosidase is the enzyme
that takes lactose which is lactose

128
00:09:33 --> 00:09:39
beta-1,4 glucose.
And somebody said it's easy to get

129
00:09:39 --> 00:09:44
them mixed up.
I apologize, but those are the

130
00:09:44 --> 00:09:50
names.  And cleaves it,
just breaks the bond to give

131
00:09:50 --> 00:09:56
galactose plus glucose.
Both of those can be metabolized by

132
00:09:56 --> 00:10:02
ordinary elements you'll
find in most cells.

133
00:10:02 --> 00:10:06
But taking lactose,
which you also know as milk sugar

134
00:10:06 --> 00:10:10
because it's in milk,
needs this extra function.

135
00:10:10 --> 00:10:14
If you're lactose intolerant,
as a fraction of you will be because

136
00:10:14 --> 00:10:18
that's quite common in the human
population, then,

137
00:10:18 --> 00:10:22
although you had the enzyme when you
were baby, it's been shut off in

138
00:10:22 --> 00:10:26
your body since then and it causes
problems.  Because if you eat

139
00:10:26 --> 00:10:30
lactose, drink milk or something,
the lactose goes right through your

140
00:10:30 --> 00:10:34
stomach and ends up
in your intestine.

141
00:10:34 --> 00:10:38
And there are bacteria in there that
are able to break it open.

142
00:10:38 --> 00:10:43
And when they do that it leads to
gas and some other sort of

143
00:10:43 --> 00:10:48
uncomfortablenesses that are
associated with lactose intolerance.

144
00:10:48 --> 00:10:52
So, as I'd said, the major finding
was that this enzyme

145
00:10:52 --> 00:10:57
beta-galactosidase or beta-gal was
regulated.  That if you grow E.

146
00:10:57 --> 00:11:05
coli on glucose --

147
00:11:05 --> 00:11:10
-- there was no beta-gal.
And if you grow them on lactose as

148
00:11:10 --> 00:11:15
the carbon source then there were
high levels of beta-gal.

149
00:11:15 --> 00:11:20
And that then lead Jacques Monod
and Francois Jacob,

150
00:11:20 --> 00:11:26
the two French scientists I
mentioned, to begin studying

151
00:11:26 --> 00:11:31
this problem.
And, like so many things in biology,

152
00:11:31 --> 00:11:36
they were working on a huge problem,
how are genes regulated?

153
00:11:36 --> 00:11:41
But it wasn't so evident at the
beginning.  What they were doing was

154
00:11:41 --> 00:11:46
this very modest thing,
why is beta-galactosidase there in

155
00:11:46 --> 00:11:51
one condition and not another?
Just a little problem in bacterial

156
00:11:51 --> 00:11:56
metabolism.  And ultimately it gave
us the roots to the answer of how

157
00:11:56 --> 00:12:01
genes are regulated.
And I just have to leave out all the

158
00:12:01 --> 00:12:05
beautify stuff that led to what they
found.  Let me just recapitulate

159
00:12:05 --> 00:12:10
what I put on the board the other
day.  It turned out that the lacZ

160
00:12:10 --> 00:12:14
gene, this is the gene that encodes
beta-galactosidase,

161
00:12:14 --> 00:12:19
so that's the sequence,
that has the sequence of codons,

162
00:12:19 --> 00:12:23
that if you could start at the
beginning and go along and just put

163
00:12:23 --> 00:12:28
all the amino acids in you would end
up with beta-galactosidase.

164
00:12:28 --> 00:12:39
That unit of genetic information,
which is called the lacC gene, let's

165
00:12:39 --> 00:12:50
put it here.  Then there were two
other genes just downstream of this

166
00:12:50 --> 00:13:01
in the DNA.  And this unit is made
as a single mRNA.

167
00:13:01 --> 00:13:05
So this is a little bit different
than what I told you.

168
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
It's not just one gene.
It's actually two or three because

169
00:13:09 --> 00:13:13
these bacteria try to do everything
very efficiently because they're

170
00:13:13 --> 00:13:17
growing quickly.
This means it can turn on three

171
00:13:17 --> 00:13:21
genes of related function very
efficiently.  When you have several

172
00:13:21 --> 00:13:25
genes that are expressed using one
mRNA, as I said,

173
00:13:25 --> 00:13:30
the genes are said to be organized
in an operon.

174
00:13:30 --> 00:13:35
But the key point that we talked
about before is you're going to have

175
00:13:35 --> 00:13:40
these genes expressed everything has
to be written in the DNA.

176
00:13:40 --> 00:13:45
And it's not using the genetic code.
It's using other words that are

177
00:13:45 --> 00:13:50
written there.
And you've seen this word now in

178
00:13:50 --> 00:13:55
several lectures.
That's a promoter.

179
00:13:55 --> 00:14:00
And that means to start
transcription.

180
00:14:00 --> 00:14:04
And to stop the mRNA there has to be
something at the other end.

181
00:14:04 --> 00:14:09
And I'll show you the sequence of
at least one of these promoters in a

182
00:14:09 --> 00:14:13
minute.  This means to stop
transcription,

183
00:14:13 --> 00:14:18
to stop making the RNA copy.
If you didn't have sequences like

184
00:14:18 --> 00:14:22
that the cell wouldn't know where
should I begin the RNA and where

185
00:14:22 --> 00:14:27
does it end.  And since there are
many, many genes,

186
00:14:27 --> 00:14:32
there have to be many promoters and
many terminators.

187
00:14:32 --> 00:14:35
And the other point I tried to
hammer home the other day is

188
00:14:35 --> 00:14:39
although the genetic code is
universal, you can take that little

189
00:14:39 --> 00:14:43
table and read the sequence of human
proteins or E.

190
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46
coli proteins, these other languages
that are written using this

191
00:14:46 --> 00:14:50
four-letter nucleic acid alphabet
are not universal.

192
00:14:50 --> 00:14:54
So the sequences that E.
coli uses for a promoter, a start

193
00:14:54 --> 00:14:58
transcription are very different
than what our bodies use as a start

194
00:14:58 --> 00:15:03
transcription thing.
And when we get to the recombinant

195
00:15:03 --> 00:15:10
DNA stuff that will be an issue.
So this mRNA is then used to make

196
00:15:10 --> 00:15:17
proteins.  This would be
beta-galactosidase or the lac-Z gene

197
00:15:17 --> 00:15:24
product, and these other genes make,
so these are proteins.  Here you see

198
00:15:24 --> 00:15:31
this flow of information from the
DNA through the mRNA down to being

199
00:15:31 --> 00:15:37
made into proteins.
In the case of bacteria there's no

200
00:15:37 --> 00:15:42
nucleus.  Everything is in one big
pot so that mRNA doesn't have to go

201
00:15:42 --> 00:15:47
anywhere, but it's all there and it
gets translated to give copies of

202
00:15:47 --> 00:15:52
the protein.  So,
as I said, somehow if the cell is

203
00:15:52 --> 00:15:57
going to now regulate whether these
genes are expressed or not,

204
00:15:57 --> 00:16:03
depending on whether lactose is
present.

205
00:16:03 --> 00:16:06
And the way they do it makes perfect
sense.  Don't bother to make the

206
00:16:06 --> 00:16:10
enzyme if there's no lactose in the
neighborhood, and only make it if

207
00:16:10 --> 00:16:14
it's present.  So how are they going
to do that?  Is the lactose going to

208
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
come along and stick into some
little hole here or something?

209
00:16:17 --> 00:16:21
That's not a general strategy and
it wouldn't work if you look at the

210
00:16:21 --> 00:16:25
structure of DNA anyway.
It wouldn't have access to the

211
00:16:25 --> 00:16:31
sequence of bases.
So what was discovered was that

212
00:16:31 --> 00:16:41
there was another gene very close
called lacI.  And the protein that

213
00:16:41 --> 00:16:50
it encodes is called the lac
repressor.  And since it's a gene it

214
00:16:50 --> 00:17:00
has to have a promoter,
a start transcription.

215
00:17:00 --> 00:17:07
But this one, be careful now,
don't get yourself mixed up, this is

216
00:17:07 --> 00:17:14
for the lacI gene.
This is a different promoter over

217
00:17:14 --> 00:17:21
here for this thing.
And then there is also then a

218
00:17:21 --> 00:17:28
terminator or a stop transcription.
And, again, this is for the lacI

219
00:17:28 --> 00:17:35
gene.  So this gets made
into an mRNA as well.

220
00:17:35 --> 00:17:44
And this gets translated into a
protein that's known as lac

221
00:17:44 --> 00:17:53
repressor.  And what that lac
repressor has is the ability to bind

222
00:17:53 --> 00:18:03
to a particular sequence in DNA
that's located right here.

223
00:18:03 --> 00:18:15
This is a binding site right here

224
00:18:15 --> 00:18:23
for lac repressor.
So let me just try to blow that up

225
00:18:23 --> 00:18:31
just a little bit because this could
be a little bit confusing.

226
00:18:31 --> 00:18:49
So here's the promoter --

227
00:18:49 --> 00:18:53
-- for this lacZYA operon.
Here's the beginning of the lacZ

228
00:18:53 --> 00:18:57
gene.  And so this is where the RNA
polymerase, the machine that's going

229
00:18:57 --> 00:19:01
to make the RNA copy has to bind.
And here's the binding site.

230
00:19:01 --> 00:19:13
-- for lac repressor or the lacI

231
00:19:13 --> 00:19:19
protein.  So how does this circuit
work?  And I sort of pose that as an

232
00:19:19 --> 00:19:25
issue for those of you who had
followed it at least to that point.

233
00:19:25 --> 00:19:32
So let's consider the two
situations.

234
00:19:32 --> 00:19:36
If there's no lactose present what
we know from just scientists knew

235
00:19:36 --> 00:19:41
from experimentation was there was
no beta-galactosidase activity

236
00:19:41 --> 00:19:45
inside the cell.
You could crack them open and you

237
00:19:45 --> 00:19:50
wouldn't find this enzyme there.
And when you added lactose they

238
00:19:50 --> 00:19:55
knew, from that experiment described
on Friday, it was synthesized de

239
00:19:55 --> 00:20:00
novo.  So if there's no
lactose present --

240
00:20:00 --> 00:20:09
And what happens is we have the lacI
gene, mRNA is being made,

241
00:20:09 --> 00:20:18
this lac repressor is being made,
here's the promoter for lacZYA, and

242
00:20:18 --> 00:20:27
here's the sequence.
And this repressor goes up and

243
00:20:27 --> 00:20:34
binds to that.
And by binding to this particular

244
00:20:34 --> 00:20:38
sequence what it does is it covers
up the promoter.

245
00:20:38 --> 00:20:43
It covers up the start signal,
the signal that says "start

246
00:20:43 --> 00:20:48
transcription here".
Are you guys with me?

247
00:20:48 --> 00:20:52
It's a relatively simple strategy.
It's just by lac repressor having

248
00:20:52 --> 00:20:57
that ability to bind to a particular
sequence it's able to prevent the

249
00:20:57 --> 00:21:02
RNA polymerase from seeing
the promoter.

250
00:21:02 --> 00:21:08
And therefore it's able to prevent
the RNA from being made.

251
00:21:08 --> 00:21:15
So there's no mRNA.  And if there's
no mRNA over here then there's no

252
00:21:15 --> 00:21:21
beta-galactosidase being made.
This is an exercise in futility.

253
00:21:21 --> 00:21:28
Why has the cell gone and made this
useless protein that isn't doing

254
00:21:28 --> 00:21:35
anything in terms of helping it
metabolize lactose?

255
00:21:35 --> 00:21:39
But now take a look at the system
compared to what I described when we

256
00:21:39 --> 00:21:43
were first doing it.
If we had to do all the regulation

257
00:21:43 --> 00:21:48
directly with the DNA we have this
problem that lactose would somehow

258
00:21:48 --> 00:21:52
have to be able to see a sequence in
DNA and somehow determine what

259
00:21:52 --> 00:21:57
happened.  But what this cell has
done now is it's set this system up

260
00:21:57 --> 00:22:01
so that the ability to make lactose
or not make lactose is conditional

261
00:22:01 --> 00:22:06
on this protein called
the lac repressor.

262
00:22:06 --> 00:22:11
If lac repressor is bound,
as it's shown here, it's basically

263
00:22:11 --> 00:22:16
covering up the promoter,
the cell cannot make RNA and cannot

264
00:22:16 --> 00:22:21
make beta-galactosidase.
If it was absent, if we just got

265
00:22:21 --> 00:22:27
rid of lac repressor then the
promoter would be exposed and the

266
00:22:27 --> 00:22:32
cell could make beta-galactosidase.
And so it's now lac repressor that

267
00:22:32 --> 00:22:37
has the conditionality.
It's, in essence, a sensor.

268
00:22:37 --> 00:22:42
It can at least be considered a
sensor for whether lactose is

269
00:22:42 --> 00:22:47
present.  And indeed that is the
property that lac repressor has.

270
00:22:47 --> 00:22:52
It's able to bind lactose.  So if
we think lactose is present

271
00:22:52 --> 00:23:00
what happens?

272
00:23:00 --> 00:23:04
I mean this lacI gene is a pretty
uninteresting,

273
00:23:04 --> 00:23:08
uninteresting from the standpoint of
regulation in the sense that it's

274
00:23:08 --> 00:23:12
made all the time.
The cell just continually cranks

275
00:23:12 --> 00:23:16
out a bit of lac repressor.
It doesn't need very much.  It just

276
00:23:16 --> 00:23:20
needs to make enough so that the one
binding site for lac repressor has

277
00:23:20 --> 00:23:24
somebody bound to it.
So it can get away with pretty low

278
00:23:24 --> 00:23:30
levels.
But over here then we have this

279
00:23:30 --> 00:23:36
promoter, and we have the lacZ gene
and so on here,

280
00:23:36 --> 00:23:43
and there is the binding sequence
right there.  But this lac repressor

281
00:23:43 --> 00:23:50
has the ability to bind lactose,
which I'm going to draw as a little

282
00:23:50 --> 00:23:56
triangle here,
even though you know it's a

283
00:23:56 --> 00:24:02
disaccharide.
It has a different property.

284
00:24:02 --> 00:24:07
But the fundamental characteristic
of the lac repressor binding lactose

285
00:24:07 --> 00:24:12
is it undergoes a change in
confirmation.  So if it's got a

286
00:24:12 --> 00:24:16
binding pocket,
and lactose fits into that binding

287
00:24:16 --> 00:24:21
pocket, those alpha helices and beta
sheets and so on move around a

288
00:24:21 --> 00:24:26
little bit.  And what happens then
is it perturbs the part of the

289
00:24:26 --> 00:24:31
protein that would normally be able
to recognize this DNA sequence.

290
00:24:31 --> 00:24:41
And this cannot --

291
00:24:41 --> 00:24:47
-- bind to the DNA sequence up here.
And I'll tell you the special name

292
00:24:47 --> 00:24:53
for that binding site.
It's just one of these terms that

293
00:24:53 --> 00:25:00
you'll see in biology.
Everything has to be given a name.

294
00:25:00 --> 00:25:06
It's called an operator,
for historical reasons.  But,

295
00:25:06 --> 00:25:12
in any case, the lac repressor,
once it's hanging onto a lactose

296
00:25:12 --> 00:25:18
it's unable to bind this sequence.
That means that the start site for

297
00:25:18 --> 00:25:24
transcription is made.
And so you get the mRNA made and

298
00:25:24 --> 00:25:30
then you get beta-galactosidase
present.

299
00:25:30 --> 00:25:34
A little bit complicated,
but sort of underlying it is this

300
00:25:34 --> 00:25:38
idea that now the cell is using a
protein rather than DNA to tell

301
00:25:38 --> 00:25:43
whether lactose is present.
And hopefully you can see this is

302
00:25:43 --> 00:25:47
really general now because you can
design a regulatory protein.

303
00:25:47 --> 00:25:52
And basically it's got to have two
things.  It's got to have a part

304
00:25:52 --> 00:25:56
that talks to the DNA and recognizes
some sequence,

305
00:25:56 --> 00:26:01
and it's got to have another part
that senses whatever it is.

306
00:26:01 --> 00:26:05
Histidine, temperature,
you name it.  But once you

307
00:26:05 --> 00:26:10
understand that design principle
then you can begin to see how it is

308
00:26:10 --> 00:26:15
that the cell is able to turn genes
on and off just by encoding

309
00:26:15 --> 00:26:20
information in the DNA.
And, as I say, one of the big

310
00:26:20 --> 00:26:25
tricks there is to let the protein
do the sensing for you.

311
00:26:25 --> 00:26:30
Now, I just want to give you a
little bit of a blowup of what this

312
00:26:30 --> 00:26:36
things looks like.
Because sort of all I've done is

313
00:26:36 --> 00:26:42
kind of put it here as a sequence.
I've called it a promoter.  What a

314
00:26:42 --> 00:26:49
promoter then is,
again it means the start for

315
00:26:49 --> 00:26:55
transcription,
the process of making RNA.

316
00:26:55 --> 00:27:02
And I've tried to stress that these
promoters are not universal.

317
00:27:02 --> 00:27:09
So when I tell you this for E.

318
00:27:09 --> 00:27:15
coli, this is what a promoter for E.
coli looks like, but it doesn't look

319
00:27:15 --> 00:27:20
at all like a promoter in our bodies.
And so it's basically a word that's

320
00:27:20 --> 00:27:26
written using this nucleic acid
alphabet.  And it looks

321
00:27:26 --> 00:27:32
something like this.
There's TTGACA and then there are

322
00:27:32 --> 00:27:38
about 17 base pairs that can be just
about anything.

323
00:27:38 --> 00:27:44
And then there's TATAAT.
And then there's another little bit

324
00:27:44 --> 00:27:50
here that's about ten base pairs
long.  And then this is the start of

325
00:27:50 --> 00:27:56
the mRNA which is usually given the
convention of being called

326
00:27:56 --> 00:28:02
the plus one position.
So you'll notice this word I've

327
00:28:02 --> 00:28:07
called it, written,
that says start transcription has

328
00:28:07 --> 00:28:12
even got two parts to it.
And this is usually referred to the

329
00:28:12 --> 00:28:17
minus ten region of the promoter,
and this is the minus 35 region

330
00:28:17 --> 00:28:22
because that's the distance from the
start of transcription.

331
00:28:22 --> 00:28:27
It maybe seem sort of weird to you
to see what I'm telling you is sort

332
00:28:27 --> 00:28:32
of word written in the nucleic
acid language.

333
00:28:32 --> 00:28:35
It's got some bits in the middle
that don't matter.

334
00:28:35 --> 00:28:39
But remember the DNA is a helix and
things going around like this.

335
00:28:39 --> 00:28:43
So if you were just to take a DNA
helix and then lay something down on

336
00:28:43 --> 00:28:47
one side of it,
it would contact it here,

337
00:28:47 --> 00:28:51
it wouldn't contact it there,
and then when it came back up again

338
00:28:51 --> 00:28:55
it would contact it here.
And so as these things hang on

339
00:28:55 --> 00:28:59
along the sides of DNA it's not at
all uncommon to find this sort of

340
00:28:59 --> 00:29:03
broken where you can have something
that matters, something that doesn't

341
00:29:03 --> 00:29:07
matter and something
that matters again.

342
00:29:07 --> 00:29:15
The RNA polymerase in E.
coli, it's a machine.  It's got four

343
00:29:15 --> 00:29:24
proteins that are the core.
That's the part that actually

344
00:29:24 --> 00:29:33
synthesizes the RNA plus one protein,
which is known as the

345
00:29:33 --> 00:29:41
sigma subunit.
And it has the special job of

346
00:29:41 --> 00:29:48
recognizing the promoter.
And so when we start asking where

347
00:29:48 --> 00:29:56
does this regulatory sequence that
the lac repressor binds

348
00:29:56 --> 00:30:04
it in all of this.
It turns out that the sequence for

349
00:30:04 --> 00:30:18
binding lac repressor --

350
00:30:18 --> 00:30:23
-- overlaps with this minus ten
region.  So when the lac repressor

351
00:30:23 --> 00:30:28
is sitting down it's covering up a
very important part of transcription.

352
00:30:28 --> 00:30:35
You guys with me?  OK.
So this is an interesting kind of

353
00:30:35 --> 00:30:44
regulation.  It's given
the general term --

354
00:30:44 --> 00:30:53
-- negative regulation.

355
00:30:53 --> 00:30:57
And the reason that term is applied,
it means that the regulatory

356
00:30:57 --> 00:31:09
protein --

357
00:31:09 --> 00:31:19
-- interferes with transcription.

358
00:31:19 --> 00:31:24
And let's take a brief foray into
we're going to talk about genetics

359
00:31:24 --> 00:31:37
as our next subject.
And I think maybe we can let you

360
00:31:37 --> 00:31:57
sort of already get a sense of how
some of this was figured out.

361
00:31:57 --> 00:32:17
So there's a substance called X-gal,
which is a galactose with some

362
00:32:17 --> 00:32:37
chemical entity hanging off that's
colorless.  But yet it's a substrate

363
00:32:37 --> 00:32:57
whose bond can be cleaved
by beta-galactosidase.

364
00:32:57 --> 00:32:52
And it gives galactose plus the free
X entity.  And this is colored.

365
00:32:52 --> 00:32:48
And this is a very useful thing for
bacterial geneticists.

366
00:32:48 --> 00:32:43
Someone said they thought this was
too much lab stuff,

367
00:32:43 --> 00:32:39
but I think if you don't have some
sense of how this is done

368
00:32:39 --> 00:32:34
experimentally I'm not doing too
good a job of conveying to you how

369
00:32:34 --> 00:32:30
we learn all this kind of thing.
It just doesn't come out of a

370
00:32:30 --> 00:32:32
textbook.
And so if we grow E.

371
00:32:32 --> 00:32:41
coli on plates that have glucose
plus X-gal, the colonies would be

372
00:32:41 --> 00:32:49
colorless.  And if we were to grow
them on plates that had lactose plus

373
00:32:49 --> 00:32:58
X-gal then all of the colonies would
be colored because they're making

374
00:32:58 --> 00:33:06
beta-galactosidase.
And part of the way that this stuff

375
00:33:06 --> 00:33:12
that I've been telling you was
figured out was by bacterial

376
00:33:12 --> 00:33:18
geneticists looking for something.
What they looked for was back here

377
00:33:18 --> 00:33:24
on this plate that had Xgal.
Almost all the colonies were

378
00:33:24 --> 00:33:30
colorless.  These were colored
because they could make

379
00:33:30 --> 00:33:36
beta-galactosidase.
So if I gave you some plates of this,

380
00:33:36 --> 00:33:44
you looked in the lab and then you
found a colored colony,

381
00:33:44 --> 00:33:52
it's a mutant.  I'll define these
terms for you very shortly.

382
00:33:52 --> 00:34:00
But it's got an alteration in the
DNA that affects the regulation --

383
00:34:00 --> 00:34:08
-- of beta-gal or the product of the

384
00:34:08 --> 00:34:14
lacC gene.  And on the basis of what
I've told you about this model,

385
00:34:14 --> 00:34:20
can you guys come up with two types
of things, two places or kinds of

386
00:34:20 --> 00:34:27
mutations that could break this
system that would lead to

387
00:34:27 --> 00:34:33
beta-galactosidase being on even
though there's no lactose

388
00:34:33 --> 00:34:39
in the medium?
Anybody see one of them?

389
00:34:39 --> 00:34:45
Why is it off?  Because of lac
repressor?  In a wild type strain

390
00:34:45 --> 00:34:51
it's because lac repressor is bound
to that sequence and it's shutting

391
00:34:51 --> 00:34:57
off transcription.
So we had a variant that could now

392
00:34:57 --> 00:35:10
transcribe.  Yeah.

393
00:35:10 --> 00:35:15
OK, so that's a good idea.
So if we could somehow mutate that

394
00:35:15 --> 00:35:21
little binding sequence in a way
that didn't screw up everything else

395
00:35:21 --> 00:35:26
then, even though there was lac
repressor being made,

396
00:35:26 --> 00:35:32
if it couldn't bind here because the
sequence had been changed

397
00:35:32 --> 00:35:37
then you'd get it made.
That's exactly right.

398
00:35:37 --> 00:35:42
That's one of them.  Yeah.
OK, it was a problem making lacI.

399
00:35:42 --> 00:35:47
What would happen?  Well, if we
couldn't make this and it couldn't

400
00:35:47 --> 00:35:51
bind there we'd be on.
And that's the other class.

401
00:35:51 --> 00:35:56
Can you think of a kind of mutation
that we learned about,

402
00:35:56 --> 00:36:01
think back to the genetic code,
that would prevent lac repressor

403
00:36:01 --> 00:36:10
from being made?

404
00:36:10 --> 00:36:14
I'm trying to give you a clue.
There were 61 codons encoded for

405
00:36:14 --> 00:36:18
amino acids.  Yeah.
Oh, that would work.

406
00:36:18 --> 00:36:23
Yup, if we messed up the promoter.
That's a sophisticated answer.

407
00:36:23 --> 00:36:27
Yeah, if we messed up the promoter
for making lacI that would

408
00:36:27 --> 00:36:33
certainly give that.
Can you think of another type of

409
00:36:33 --> 00:36:39
thing that would affect the lacI
gene, would prevent lacI from being

410
00:36:39 --> 00:36:49
made?  Somebody?  Yeah.

411
00:36:49 --> 00:36:52
OK.  If the sequence was wrong so
that they could bind,

412
00:36:52 --> 00:36:56
that would be good.  The one I'm
trying to tease out of you,

413
00:36:56 --> 00:37:00
but I won't take longer now,
is remember those three stop codons

414
00:37:00 --> 00:37:03
that didn't encode for anything?
There should be one of those at the

415
00:37:03 --> 00:37:07
end of the protein.
But if you changed one of the amino

416
00:37:07 --> 00:37:11
acid codons into a stop codon that
would also prevent you from making

417
00:37:11 --> 00:37:15
it.  So there are at least a couple
of kinds of mutations.

418
00:37:15 --> 00:37:18
And what I've sort of done here is
I've skipped all the evidence and

419
00:37:18 --> 00:37:22
given you the model.
And I cannot give you all the

420
00:37:22 --> 00:37:26
evidence that lead to this,
which is a pretty well-established

421
00:37:26 --> 00:37:30
model.  I don't think this is going
to change likely.

422
00:37:30 --> 00:37:35
We've been studying it for so long.
But this is the kind of evidence on

423
00:37:35 --> 00:37:40
which it was based.
In was by people finding things and

424
00:37:40 --> 00:37:45
figuring out that parts of the
machinery were broken and then

425
00:37:45 --> 00:37:51
working on.  So there's another kind
of regulation known as positive

426
00:37:51 --> 00:37:56
regulation.  And for a long time
people though maybe everything was

427
00:37:56 --> 00:38:01
negative regulation.
But it turns out positive regulation

428
00:38:01 --> 00:38:06
is far more common.
In this case, the regulatory

429
00:38:06 --> 00:38:11
protein instead of inhibiting
transcription assists with the

430
00:38:11 --> 00:38:16
transcription.
And it turned out,

431
00:38:16 --> 00:38:21
after people had been studying the
beta-galactosidase system for a

432
00:38:21 --> 00:38:26
number of years,
that it had a positive control

433
00:38:26 --> 00:38:32
system superimposed or together with
the negative regulatory system.

434
00:38:32 --> 00:38:37
The same thing engineers do all the
time, pile up regulatory circuits

435
00:38:37 --> 00:38:42
and get all kinds of additional
conditionalities.

436
00:38:42 --> 00:38:47
And the thing I've told you saw far
was we asked whether beta-gal is

437
00:38:47 --> 00:38:55
present.  And the carbon source --

438
00:38:55 --> 00:39:02
-- is glucose.
This is low or not there.

439
00:39:02 --> 00:39:08
If it's lactose it's high,
but if cells were grown on both,

440
00:39:08 --> 00:39:13
glucose plus lactose, then
beta-galactosidase is low again.

441
00:39:13 --> 00:39:18
And this makes some physiological
sense because E.

442
00:39:18 --> 00:39:24
coli likes to use galactose.
It's its favorite food source.

443
00:39:24 --> 00:39:29
And so if it's got its favorite
food source around then it doesn't

444
00:39:29 --> 00:39:35
want to make proteins that are used
to eat all its sort of less

445
00:39:35 --> 00:39:40
favorite food source.
So there's a nice conditionality

446
00:39:40 --> 00:39:44
here.  In order for it,
the circuitry is set up so that it

447
00:39:44 --> 00:39:48
only makes the enzyme for
metabolizing lactose when the cell

448
00:39:48 --> 00:39:53
realizes its favorite food source
isn't there and then it senses

449
00:39:53 --> 00:39:57
there's lactose.
So only under those conditions does

450
00:39:57 --> 00:40:02
it make the enzymes for
making lactose.

451
00:40:02 --> 00:40:06
And, again, the way this circuitry
works, this positive regulation

452
00:40:06 --> 00:40:11
needs two things.
Once again, it needs a protein.

453
00:40:11 --> 00:40:16
This one has given the name CRP.
And, again, it's something that's

454
00:40:16 --> 00:40:21
able to bind to a sequence in DNA.
And then it's also got a

455
00:40:21 --> 00:40:25
conditionality.
It's able to recognize something

456
00:40:25 --> 00:40:30
else.  And what this one recognizes
is this small molecule that's known

457
00:40:30 --> 00:40:36
on cyclic A&P.
It's just the familiar

458
00:40:36 --> 00:40:42
[ribomonophosphate?
that you've seen before but it's

459
00:40:42 --> 00:40:48
looped around and formed an ester
bond here.  And that's why it's

460
00:40:48 --> 00:40:54
called cyclic A&P.
But the important thing about this

461
00:40:54 --> 00:41:01
is that the levels of cyclic A&P are
dependant on glucose.

462
00:41:01 --> 00:41:12
So if you have high glucose you have
low cyclic A&P and if you have low

463
00:41:12 --> 00:41:23
glucose you have high cyclic A&P.
And here again is what's going to

464
00:41:23 --> 00:41:35
happen.  So this is the promoter for
lacZYA and here's the start of the

465
00:41:35 --> 00:41:46
lacZ gene.  And I told you this is
where the operator would be finding.

466
00:41:46 --> 00:41:58
This CRP protein is able to bind to
--

467
00:41:58 --> 00:42:08
-- a site that's even a little bit

468
00:42:08 --> 00:42:16
farther upstream of the lacZ gene
than is the promoter.

469
00:42:16 --> 00:42:24
And the idea of this is that if
this CRP [lacs?] --

470
00:42:24 --> 00:42:33
-- just by itself,

471
00:42:33 --> 00:42:40
it doesn't bind to the DNA.
But it has a little binding pocket

472
00:42:40 --> 00:42:48
that senses the levels of cyclic A&P.
So if the cell is starving for

473
00:42:48 --> 00:42:55
glucose, there are high levels of
A&P, then the CRP bound to cyclic

474
00:42:55 --> 00:43:03
A&P, this is capable of binding
to this sequence.

475
00:43:03 --> 00:43:12
So that sounds weird,
but what we've, again,

476
00:43:12 --> 00:43:21
got now is we've got a protein whose
binding to DNA is conditional to

477
00:43:21 --> 00:43:30
something inside the cell.
And rather than getting in the way,

478
00:43:30 --> 00:43:39
what this does, if you have a
situation where you have CRP with

479
00:43:39 --> 00:43:48
cyclic A&P bond to it and it's next
door to this promoter,

480
00:43:48 --> 00:43:57
what it's able to do is help RNA
polymerase recognize the promoter.

481
00:43:57 --> 00:44:06
So this helps RNA polymerase.
Whereas, when we were talking about

482
00:44:06 --> 00:44:11
the lac repressor what it was doing,
if you recall, was getting in the

483
00:44:11 --> 00:44:16
way of RNA polymerase.
And this actually has a relatively

484
00:44:16 --> 00:44:21
simple sort of molecular explanation
for what's going on.  The

485
00:44:21 --> 00:44:34
RNA polymerase --

486
00:44:34 --> 00:44:39
The best sequence for the minus ten
region of the promoter,

487
00:44:39 --> 00:44:45
that I showed you over on the other
board, is something with the

488
00:44:45 --> 00:44:50
sequence TATAAT.
So the RNA polymerase machinery,

489
00:44:50 --> 00:44:56
it can recognize more than one
sequence, but if it sees a promoter

490
00:44:56 --> 00:45:01
that has a minus ten region that is
TATAAT, it really binds well and

491
00:45:01 --> 00:45:07
that would be a very strong promoter
and you get lots of mRNA.

492
00:45:07 --> 00:45:15
Now, the lacZ promoter actually has
two nucleotides that are different.

493
00:45:15 --> 00:45:26
It's TATGTT.

494
00:45:26 --> 00:45:38
So this is a very weak promoter
without help.

495
00:45:38 --> 00:45:43
So in this lac system,
if we got rid of lac repressor

496
00:45:43 --> 00:45:48
entirely so that the promoter was
just exposed all the time,

497
00:45:48 --> 00:45:53
as I showed you up here, I've left
out a detail in this first part in

498
00:45:53 --> 00:45:59
that this promoter is
not very strong.

499
00:45:59 --> 00:46:03
And we'd only get a little bit of
RNA and a little bit of protein.

500
00:46:03 --> 00:46:08
And so what the cell does is if it
knows there is no galactose,

501
00:46:08 --> 00:46:13
knows there's no glucose around and
cyclic A&P levels are high then it

502
00:46:13 --> 00:46:18
uses the binding of the CRP to here
to assist the RNA polymerase and get

503
00:46:18 --> 00:46:23
on.  I understand this is a bit
complicated.  Some of you probably

504
00:46:23 --> 00:46:28
have it.  Some of you will be lost
and you'll have to sit and look at

505
00:46:28 --> 00:46:32
your textbook for a little while.
But it comes down to a couple of

506
00:46:32 --> 00:46:36
really simple principles.
One is to detect what's going on

507
00:46:36 --> 00:46:40
the cell makes a regulatory protein,
the regulatory protein binds DNA and

508
00:46:40 --> 00:46:44
it also senses something.
And these things can work in two

509
00:46:44 --> 00:46:48
ways.  They can either bind DNA and
get in the way,

510
00:46:48 --> 00:46:52
they can be a negative regulatory
element, or they can bind to DNA and

511
00:46:52 --> 00:46:56
they can help something happen and
be a positive regulatory element.

512
00:46:56 --> 00:47:00
All the rest are just the details
of lac.

513
00:47:00 --> 00:47:04
And we could spend the entire course
or regulation and barely scratch the

514
00:47:04 --> 00:47:09
surface, but it's one of the huge
secrets of life that cells are able

515
00:47:09 --> 00:47:13
to individually turn on different
genes in different ways at different

516
00:47:13 --> 00:47:18
times, have rheostats for levels,
coordinate great sets of genes in

517
00:47:18 --> 00:47:21
response to various stimuli.
OK?  See you on Wednesday.
