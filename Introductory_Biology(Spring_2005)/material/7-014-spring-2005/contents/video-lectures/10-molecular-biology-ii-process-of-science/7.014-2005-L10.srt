1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:05
So in the last lecture I spent quite
a while trying to convey a sense of

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:10
how the structure of DNA was
discovered.  The crystallographic

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:16
data that led to it,
as I said, was collected by Roslyn

4
00:00:16 --> 00:00:21
Franklin.  And I saw there was some
confusion about this picture that I

5
00:00:21 --> 00:00:27
showed you next.
This is not a photograph of a

6
00:00:27 --> 00:00:32
double helix.
This is what happened when she

7
00:00:32 --> 00:00:36
bounced the x-ray off the crystal of
DNA.  This is the diffraction

8
00:00:36 --> 00:00:40
pattern that she saw.
And then one works backwards from

9
00:00:40 --> 00:00:44
that trying to figure out what kind
of structure it was that would have

10
00:00:44 --> 00:00:49
caused that diffraction pattern.
And you have to be a pretty good

11
00:00:49 --> 00:00:53
x-ray crystallographer to draw any
kind of inferences from that.

12
00:00:53 --> 00:00:57
And there people, including Francis
Crick, who saw the implications

13
00:00:57 --> 00:01:02
of it right away.
But the point was she collected the

14
00:01:02 --> 00:01:06
data and then two people that I told
you about then whose name you know

15
00:01:06 --> 00:01:10
so well, Jim Watson and Francis
Crick, were the two individuals that

16
00:01:10 --> 00:01:14
came up with the model that
explained the diffraction pattern.

17
00:01:14 --> 00:01:19
And therefore we learned the
structure of DNA as a

18
00:01:19 --> 00:01:23
double-stranded helix.
I also tried to make the case that

19
00:01:23 --> 00:01:27
it wasn't two geniuses who sat down
in the room, took a look at this and

20
00:01:27 --> 00:01:32
popped up with the model.
It was a story of real people with

21
00:01:32 --> 00:01:36
misadventures and mistakes and
recovery from mistakes and so on

22
00:01:36 --> 00:01:41
getting it.  It was also a very
small group.  And I'm going to take

23
00:01:41 --> 00:01:45
just a very small minute at the
beginning of the class because I

24
00:01:45 --> 00:01:49
have a colleague,
Vernon Ingram who's sitting down

25
00:01:49 --> 00:01:54
here in the front,
who was a member of this very small

26
00:01:54 --> 00:01:58
group with Jim Watson and Francis
Crick.  So here was there where all

27
00:01:58 --> 00:02:02
this happened.
And almost nobody in the world has

28
00:02:02 --> 00:02:06
had a chance in your generation to
hear directly from somebody who was

29
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
there when it happened.
So asked Vernon if he would come

30
00:02:10 --> 00:02:14
and just talk to you for a little
bit just what it was

31
00:02:14 --> 00:02:54
like to be there.

32
00:02:54 --> 00:03:00
Well, thanks, Graham.
You seem to be at a very exciting

33
00:03:00 --> 00:03:06
state in 7.014.
This structure of the secret of life,

34
00:03:06 --> 00:03:14
no less.  And it's interesting that
immediately when Watson and Crick

35
00:03:14 --> 00:03:22
put together a model of the DNA
molecule that fit the x-ray data,

36
00:03:22 --> 00:03:30
that was the point, how do you know
a model is correct?

37
00:03:30 --> 00:03:36
Because there are certain distances
in the model, and those have to

38
00:03:36 --> 00:03:43
correlate exactly with the distances
of the x-ray spots in the

39
00:03:43 --> 00:03:49
diffraction pattern that you saw.
That's how you know that a model

40
00:03:49 --> 00:03:56
that you've built to certain
specifications corresponds to what

41
00:03:56 --> 00:04:02
the molecule of itself in the
crystal that you're examining

42
00:04:02 --> 00:04:09
actually is composed of.
It was by sheer accident that I

43
00:04:09 --> 00:04:15
happened to be working as a
biochemist in the MRC,

44
00:04:15 --> 00:04:22
The Medical Research Council lab at
the Cavendish Laboratory where

45
00:04:22 --> 00:04:28
Watson and Crick were working.
Sheer accident.  It was a very

46
00:04:28 --> 00:04:35
crowded lab, as Graham said.
And that's something that you should

47
00:04:35 --> 00:04:41
remember.  When you're choosing a
lab to work in,

48
00:04:41 --> 00:04:47
always go to a lab that's
overcrowded.  Never go to a lab

49
00:04:47 --> 00:04:53
where there's lots of space because
a really successful lab attracts so

50
00:04:53 --> 00:04:59
many coworkers,
visitors that it rapidly gets

51
00:04:59 --> 00:05:05
overcrowded.
And that was the case in this

52
00:05:05 --> 00:05:12
laboratory.  The director was Max
Perutz.  Co-director John Kendrew

53
00:05:12 --> 00:05:20
doing x-ray crystallography of
proteins for almost the first time,

54
00:05:20 --> 00:05:27
and solving the protein structure.
Francis Crick was a graduate student

55
00:05:27 --> 00:05:33
of Max Perutz's doing his PhD work.
And the first thing I remember about

56
00:05:33 --> 00:05:39
Francis was when I went there as a
biochemist to work with Max Perutz,

57
00:05:39 --> 00:05:44
when I went there, there was this
tall gangling guy constantly

58
00:05:44 --> 00:05:50
circulating between the top floor of
the building, his office in the

59
00:05:50 --> 00:05:55
middle and the x-ray machines at the
bottom.  He was constantly going up

60
00:05:55 --> 00:06:01
and down.  And in those days the
buildings didn't have an elevators

61
00:06:01 --> 00:06:07
or lifts as the English
called them.

62
00:06:07 --> 00:06:13
So he was in excellent physical
shape.  Very crowded,

63
00:06:13 --> 00:06:19
a very modest lab.  And what's
usually forgotten is a key member of

64
00:06:19 --> 00:06:25
that group, an engineer,
Tony Broad, key person because he

65
00:06:25 --> 00:06:31
invented what was then the world's
best and most efficient x-ray

66
00:06:31 --> 00:06:37
machine, a rotating anode
x-ray machine.

67
00:06:37 --> 00:06:43
And because to the x-ray
crystallographers in that group this

68
00:06:43 --> 00:06:49
machine was available,
because of that they were the

69
00:06:49 --> 00:06:56
preeminent x-ray structure group in
the world.  My job was as a

70
00:06:56 --> 00:07:02
biochemist protein biochemistry
putting a heavy atom,

71
00:07:02 --> 00:07:08
mercury, very heavy atom into Max
Parutz's hemoglobin crystals

72
00:07:08 --> 00:07:15
in specific places.
That has a predictable effect on the

73
00:07:15 --> 00:07:21
x-ray pattern and that enables the
Fourier diagram to be constructed

74
00:07:21 --> 00:07:28
with real phase values for the x-ray
diffractions, for the physicists

75
00:07:28 --> 00:07:36
among you here.
Are there any physicists here?

76
00:07:36 --> 00:07:44
Yeah, I thought so.  That was a big
step forward and that was also a big

77
00:07:44 --> 00:07:52
step in figuring out the structure
of the DNA samples semi-crystals

78
00:07:52 --> 00:08:00
that Professor Walker
just referred to.

79
00:08:00 --> 00:08:05
All dependent on the engineer Tony
Broad who is never mentioned in any

80
00:08:05 --> 00:08:11
of these histories,
but without him this would not have

81
00:08:11 --> 00:08:17
happened.  So it was an exciting
place to work in,

82
00:08:17 --> 00:08:22
very exciting.  We were all young in
those days.  And living the lives of

83
00:08:22 --> 00:08:28
young men and young women with all
the complications that arise when

84
00:08:28 --> 00:08:34
you put a whole bunch of very
energetic young men,

85
00:08:34 --> 00:08:39
very energetic young women together.
And by that I mean the interpersonal

86
00:08:39 --> 00:08:45
relationships which when you're in a
crowded, very active situation can

87
00:08:45 --> 00:08:50
sometimes interfere.
And always very entertaining,

88
00:08:50 --> 00:08:55
I can tell you that.  I could give
you chapter and verse.

89
00:08:55 --> 00:09:01
But it isn't really so very
different from people

90
00:09:01 --> 00:09:07
your age now, right?
I mean I'm not saying it interferes

91
00:09:07 --> 00:09:13
with you, sometimes it might.
But it was an exciting lab, an

92
00:09:13 --> 00:09:20
exciting time to be there because we
were not the only group trying to

93
00:09:20 --> 00:09:26
figure out the structure of DNA.
A huge competitor was Linus Pauling

94
00:09:26 --> 00:09:33
at Caltech who had beaten that same
group once before,

95
00:09:33 --> 00:09:39
quite recently, over the alpha helix,
the crucial component of

96
00:09:39 --> 00:09:45
protein structure.
He got the right answer first,

97
00:09:45 --> 00:09:51
1.5 angstrom reflection, the alpha
helix.  And our group,

98
00:09:51 --> 00:09:57
Max Parutz and our group had been
wrong.  So the group was smarting

99
00:09:57 --> 00:10:03
under that kind of defeat,
if you like.

100
00:10:03 --> 00:10:10
And competition is a wonderful spur,
as long as you don't let it get out

101
00:10:10 --> 00:10:17
of hand.  Well,
needless to say we didn't,

102
00:10:17 --> 00:10:24
but the competition with the Pauling
lab was certainly so severe that we

103
00:10:24 --> 00:10:30
awaited the next letter.
You see, in those days new

104
00:10:30 --> 00:10:35
scientific information arrived not
by publications,

105
00:10:35 --> 00:10:40
that too much too long,
but by personal letter.  And,

106
00:10:40 --> 00:10:45
in fact, the NIH has put together
all these various letters in the

107
00:10:45 --> 00:10:50
Francis Crick collection.
And when you have time you should

108
00:10:50 --> 00:10:55
look at those.
They're quite interesting because

109
00:10:55 --> 00:11:01
they tell you in a way a scientific
paper does not tell you.

110
00:11:01 --> 00:11:06
What I feel about my experiment
results.  What she feels about her

111
00:11:06 --> 00:11:11
experiment results.
What it means to me as a person,

112
00:11:11 --> 00:11:16
to her as a person, to him as a
person.  So we were constantly

113
00:11:16 --> 00:11:22
watching the mail and discussing the
news as it came in,

114
00:11:22 --> 00:11:27
mostly over a beer at the pub next
door.  It was very conveniently

115
00:11:27 --> 00:11:33
located.
But being a small group crowded

116
00:11:33 --> 00:11:39
together made communication within
our group very easy indeed.

117
00:11:39 --> 00:11:45
And we had fights.  I don't mean
physical fights.

118
00:11:45 --> 00:11:51
We had scientific fights.
And as a biochemist I was able to

119
00:11:51 --> 00:11:57
settle a crucial fight among the
crystallographers Crick and Watson

120
00:11:57 --> 00:12:02
who were building the model.
Because, quite frankly,

121
00:12:02 --> 00:12:07
they didn't know much chemistry.
And were trying to build a model

122
00:12:07 --> 00:12:13
with the wrong confirmation of the
peptide bond.  They didn't realize

123
00:12:13 --> 00:12:18
that the peptide bond has two
possible confirmations.

124
00:12:18 --> 00:12:23
And they had at one point a
terrible time trying to fit

125
00:12:23 --> 00:12:29
everything together because they
were using the wrong confirmation.

126
00:12:29 --> 00:12:34
I'm talking about lactam-lactim for
those of you who are organic

127
00:12:34 --> 00:12:39
chemists and it means something,
a confirmation.  And once they got

128
00:12:39 --> 00:12:44
the first confirmation then the
model clicked into place.

129
00:12:44 --> 00:12:50
So we all helped, that's what I'm
trying to say.

130
00:12:50 --> 00:12:55
We all helped with one great aim in
mind.  It was clear.

131
00:12:55 --> 00:13:00
And you know from what Professor
Walker said, that the DNA structure,

132
00:13:00 --> 00:13:06
in its structure held the clue to
crucial physiological

133
00:13:06 --> 00:13:11
behavior of DNA.
And Crick and Watson said this in

134
00:13:11 --> 00:13:17
their first paper,
the structure itself because of its

135
00:13:17 --> 00:13:22
complimentarity gives you an
immediate clue as to how it

136
00:13:22 --> 00:13:27
replicates.  And replication of DNA
structure from generation to

137
00:13:27 --> 00:13:33
generation is,
of course, the crucial thing about

138
00:13:33 --> 00:13:38
DNA.
The copying, the precise copying

139
00:13:38 --> 00:13:43
from generation to generation.
And that fell out the of x-ray

140
00:13:43 --> 00:13:49
structure.  That's why the x-ray
structure was so very important,

141
00:13:49 --> 00:13:54
because it gave you an immediate
understanding of the role of DNA in

142
00:13:54 --> 00:14:00
modern biology.  So that's
what we did.

143
00:14:00 --> 00:14:06
And eventually the people in the
group, the group got so overcrowded

144
00:14:06 --> 00:14:13
they built a huge lab that was
beautiful, like any new lab is.

145
00:14:13 --> 00:14:19
But the thing I remember most of
all was the atmosphere in that place.

146
00:14:19 --> 00:14:26
So remember, when you go and choose
a lab, choose one that's overcrowded.

147
00:14:26 --> 00:14:45
It will pay off.  [APPLAUSE]

148
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
Thank you so much.
That was really wonderful.

149
00:14:47 --> 00:14:59
Thank you.

150
00:14:59 --> 00:15:02
I don't know if some of you realized
quite how rare that was,

151
00:15:02 --> 00:15:05
this discovery of the structure of
DNA.  As I said,

152
00:15:05 --> 00:15:09
probably one of the big discoveries
of mankind.  Because,

153
00:15:09 --> 00:15:12
as Vernon said, you could see so
many of the secrets of life as soon

154
00:15:12 --> 00:15:16
as you saw that structure.
Very few people have ever heard

155
00:15:16 --> 00:15:19
from someone who was there at the
time.  Maybe you'll forget a bunch

156
00:15:19 --> 00:15:23
of stuff down the line,
but I hope you'll remember you heard

157
00:15:23 --> 00:15:26
somebody who was there when Wesson
and Crick were there and maybe his

158
00:15:26 --> 00:15:30
extra piece of advice about
choosing a lab.

159
00:15:30 --> 00:15:33
To say one thing quickly,
some of you I think understood what

160
00:15:33 --> 00:15:37
I've been trying to do.
I spent quite a bit of time talking

161
00:15:37 --> 00:15:40
about science being done by real
people doing real experiments.

162
00:15:40 --> 00:15:44
Thanks for your comments.  A few of
you have gone out of your way to say

163
00:15:44 --> 00:15:48
that this was a total waste of time
and you didn't understand why I

164
00:15:48 --> 00:15:51
didn't teach you something instead
of doing something on the test.

165
00:15:51 --> 00:15:55
Well, I'm making up the test.  And
if you don't think there'll be

166
00:15:55 --> 00:15:59
something on scientific process on
the second exam you'll

167
00:15:59 --> 00:16:02
be surprised.
So I'm spending a lot of time on

168
00:16:02 --> 00:16:06
this, and the reason is because you
are MIT student.

169
00:16:06 --> 00:16:09
You know, you can go many places in
the country to many high school

170
00:16:09 --> 00:16:12
biology courses and you can memorize,
someone will tell you to memorize

171
00:16:12 --> 00:16:16
everything that's in the book,
and you'll get tested whether you

172
00:16:16 --> 00:16:19
can memorize it.
You guys are at MIT because you

173
00:16:19 --> 00:16:23
have the potential to be leaders in
whatever you do.

174
00:16:23 --> 00:16:26
I've made the transition from being
an undergrad sort of trying to

175
00:16:26 --> 00:16:30
memorize stuff in a textbook to
working on a cutting-edge.

176
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
I've made some reasonably
significant discoveries in science,

177
00:16:32 --> 00:16:35
as have my other colleagues in the
department, some of them making

178
00:16:35 --> 00:16:38
greater than I.
But nevertheless if you're on the

179
00:16:38 --> 00:16:41
cutting-edge then you're dealing
with all the stuff I'm trying to

180
00:16:41 --> 00:16:44
tell you about in this thing.
You're working as a part of a group.

181
00:16:44 --> 00:16:47
There's competition.
There are interpersonal

182
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
relationships.
You make mistakes.

183
00:16:50 --> 00:16:53
You recover from them.
You're making inferences.

184
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56
You're testing models.  This is a
very complex, very real,

185
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
very dynamic, very human interaction.
I hope you got a little bit of

186
00:16:59 --> 00:17:03
whiff of that from Vernon.
And I wouldn't be,

187
00:17:03 --> 00:17:07
I'm quite capable of reproducing
diagrams from the textbook without

188
00:17:07 --> 00:17:11
trying to give you a deeper
understanding,

189
00:17:11 --> 00:17:15
and that's what I'm trying to do
here.  And I hope if it hasn't made

190
00:17:15 --> 00:17:19
sense to you by the end that at
least a few more of you will get it.

191
00:17:19 --> 00:17:23
And those of you who I think saw
what I was doing I appreciate your

192
00:17:23 --> 00:17:27
telling me that in the things.
These are anonymous so I don't know,

193
00:17:27 --> 00:17:31
but a couple of you are certainly
trying to make it clear that you

194
00:17:31 --> 00:17:35
didn't think it was worth your time
coming to lecture.

195
00:17:35 --> 00:17:38
I'm trying to tell you why I'm
trying to do it.

196
00:17:38 --> 00:17:41
I'm trying to teach you in a deeper
way.  And this is a required course.

197
00:17:41 --> 00:17:44
It's important for your life.  I
hope some of you will see that or if

198
00:17:44 --> 00:17:47
you don't see it now you'll see it
later in your career.

199
00:17:47 --> 00:17:50
OK.  Now, we're going to talk about
DNA replication.

200
00:17:50 --> 00:17:53
I'm going to start to drive into
some of the details that maybe are

201
00:17:53 --> 00:17:56
more the kind of things you're
expecting.  I just want to make one

202
00:17:56 --> 00:17:59
quick point here.
I've talked about cell division and

203
00:17:59 --> 00:18:03
we saw this, how cells come from
other cells going to make more cells.

204
00:18:03 --> 00:18:07
I showed you this little movie
you've seen a few times of a yeast

205
00:18:07 --> 00:18:10
cell dividing,
but all cells divide.

206
00:18:10 --> 00:18:14
Here's a cancer cell dividing.
If you get a cancer it's a cell

207
00:18:14 --> 00:18:17
that's forgotten how to stop
dividing and is growing to make a

208
00:18:17 --> 00:18:21
tumor.  There's this cancer cell
dividing.  It looks not unlike a

209
00:18:21 --> 00:18:25
yeast on a molecular level,
very, very similar.  But there's

210
00:18:25 --> 00:18:29
another point.
I told you how the structure of DNA

211
00:18:29 --> 00:18:33
with the complimentary strands with
G pairing with C and A pairing with

212
00:18:33 --> 00:18:37
T immediately gave rise to an
insight as to how the genetic

213
00:18:37 --> 00:18:41
material could be replicated.
And you guys know that it's held

214
00:18:41 --> 00:18:45
together by hydrogen bonds between
base pairs which are about

215
00:18:45 --> 00:18:49
one-twentieth the strength of the
covalent bonds.

216
00:18:49 --> 00:18:53
So you're able to peel the strands
apart without breaking the covalent

217
00:18:53 --> 00:18:57
bonds.  And then by pairing A with T
and G with C and doing that on both

218
00:18:57 --> 00:19:02
strands then you can end up with two
identical copies.

219
00:19:02 --> 00:19:05
And so if you do two identical
copies and you do it again you get

220
00:19:05 --> 00:19:09
eight.  One of the things we've
realized over the last two or three

221
00:19:09 --> 00:19:13
years in looking through the exams
is somehow, at least some of the

222
00:19:13 --> 00:19:17
class, didn't connect the business
about cells coming from other cells

223
00:19:17 --> 00:19:21
and DNA duplicating to give daughter
DNA.  And I'm just trying to hammer

224
00:19:21 --> 00:19:25
home the point that these are
related.  Every time a cell divides

225
00:19:25 --> 00:19:29
it has to duplicate its
genetic information.

226
00:19:29 --> 00:19:33
That's why I'm going to be telling
you about DNA replication.

227
00:19:33 --> 00:19:37
Here's a picture of that same
cancer cell, but watch over here.

228
00:19:37 --> 00:19:41
This is the DNA.  And you see it's
doubled.  And see how the DNA,

229
00:19:41 --> 00:19:46
which is the chromosomes, has pulled
apart so that at the end you now

230
00:19:46 --> 00:19:50
have two cells and you've got
identical copies of DNA.

231
00:19:50 --> 00:19:54
So if you're studying cancer,
for example, this sort of thing is

232
00:19:54 --> 00:19:59
relevant to you.  OK.  So
the issue of how --

233
00:19:59 --> 00:20:03
Well, before I do that,
I'm sorry.  Just a couple of things

234
00:20:03 --> 00:20:08
about DNA replication before I dive
into this.  So we all started out as

235
00:20:08 --> 00:20:13
a single cell.
I've got a lot more obviously

236
00:20:13 --> 00:20:18
because I'm made up of a lot of
cells.  If I took all the DNA in my

237
00:20:18 --> 00:20:22
body and I wind up all the molecules
in it, do you guys have any idea how

238
00:20:22 --> 00:20:27
long that would be?
Who thinks it would reach let's say

239
00:20:27 --> 00:20:33
across the room?
OK.  Across campus?

240
00:20:33 --> 00:20:39
Across Cambridge?  Around the world?
To the moon?  Anybody left?

241
00:20:39 --> 00:20:46
To the sun?  I've got ten to the
fourteenth cells.

242
00:20:46 --> 00:20:52
There's about a meter or two in
each cell.  10 to 20 billion miles

243
00:20:52 --> 00:20:59
of DNA in each of our
bodies, human DNA.

244
00:20:59 --> 00:21:03
They would go back and forth to the
sun multiple times.

245
00:21:03 --> 00:21:07
So that much DNA had to get
replicated in order for the

246
00:21:07 --> 00:21:12
fertilized egg we all started out as
to become you.

247
00:21:12 --> 00:21:16
Another thing,
the accuracy of replication is about

248
00:21:16 --> 00:21:21
ten to the minus tenth.
Most people, including myself,

249
00:21:21 --> 00:21:25
don't have a very good feel for
exponents.  So that's one

250
00:21:25 --> 00:21:30
mistake in 10 billion.
You know, it could be one mistake in

251
00:21:30 --> 00:21:34
10 to the ninety-ninth.
Well, what is one mistake in 10

252
00:21:34 --> 00:21:39
billion mean?  So let's relate it to
something we know.

253
00:21:39 --> 00:21:43
If I was typing let's say an eight
letter word, 60 words a minute,

254
00:21:43 --> 00:21:48
24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and I
was as good as DNA replication,

255
00:21:48 --> 00:21:52
how often would I make a mistake?
So you can each think of how long

256
00:21:52 --> 00:21:57
you think that is.
But if I was good on average,

257
00:21:57 --> 00:22:02
I would make a mistake once every 38
years.

258
00:22:02 --> 00:22:06
So I'm about to tell you about a
process that's absolutely

259
00:22:06 --> 00:22:11
astonishing in terms of how fast and
how much you can do and with an

260
00:22:11 --> 00:22:15
accuracy that goes beyond what we're
used to in our ordinary life.

261
00:22:15 --> 00:22:20
So how does it do this?  It has to
be more than just pulling the

262
00:22:20 --> 00:22:24
strands apart.
And there's been some confusion as

263
00:22:24 --> 00:22:29
to why I'm emphasizing
5 prime and 3 prime.

264
00:22:29 --> 00:22:34
Well, each of these subunits,
each nucleotide, this is a 3 prime

265
00:22:34 --> 00:22:39
hydroxyl and this is the 5 prime
position.  If we were joining

266
00:22:39 --> 00:22:44
together subunits that had a hook
and an eye it would make a

267
00:22:44 --> 00:22:49
difference because it's not the same
on both ends.  If we're going to

268
00:22:49 --> 00:22:54
start hooking together it's exactly
the same thing when we get to a

269
00:22:54 --> 00:22:59
biochemical level,
the 5 prime end is not the same as

270
00:22:59 --> 00:23:04
hydroxyl at the 3 prime end because
the whole thing is asymmetric.

271
00:23:04 --> 00:23:12
So the enzymes that copy DNA are
known as DNA polymerases.

272
00:23:12 --> 00:23:20
And it was a very difficult
challenge to figure out how they

273
00:23:20 --> 00:23:28
operated, but Arthur Kornberg was
the first person to solve

274
00:23:28 --> 00:23:36
this problem.
He was an extraordinarily gifted

275
00:23:36 --> 00:23:43
biochemist.  He's still at Stanford.
And what he found was if we have a

276
00:23:43 --> 00:23:49
5 prime end this would then be the 3
prime end, and there's a 3 prime

277
00:23:49 --> 00:23:56
hydroxyl which is this one right
here.  And this was paired,

278
00:23:56 --> 00:24:02
say, with a C and A paired with a T.
And let's say a G paired with a C

279
00:24:02 --> 00:24:07
here.  And let's say the next
template base was,

280
00:24:07 --> 00:24:12
let's make it a T.  What Arthur
Kornberg was able to find was an

281
00:24:12 --> 00:24:18
enzyme activity that catalyzed a
template-dependent replication of

282
00:24:18 --> 00:24:23
DNA.  That was critical because he
had to find, if you broke the cells

283
00:24:23 --> 00:24:28
open, somewhere in that gamish of
enzymes and things from

284
00:24:28 --> 00:24:33
inside a cell.
There had to be something that was

285
00:24:33 --> 00:24:37
able to copy DNA.
So in order to do that he had to

286
00:24:37 --> 00:24:41
work out an assay.
And he also had to have some kind

287
00:24:41 --> 00:24:45
of guess as to what the cell would
be using in order to carry out the

288
00:24:45 --> 00:24:49
synthesis.  But one thing that was
sort of obvious was a DNA template

289
00:24:49 --> 00:24:53
because that was being copies.
But the other part was you had to

290
00:24:53 --> 00:24:58
have energy to form
a covalent bond.

291
00:24:58 --> 00:25:02
So somehow there had to be something
that was sort of activated with the

292
00:25:02 --> 00:25:07
energy built into the molecule so
that thermodynamically the whole

293
00:25:07 --> 00:25:12
thing would slide downhill when you
made a bond.  And he knew that the

294
00:25:12 --> 00:25:17
cell had triphosphates,
just the same type that we talked

295
00:25:17 --> 00:25:36
about when we talked about ATP.

296
00:25:36 --> 00:25:43
So this would be a
deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate.

297
00:25:43 --> 00:25:51
And he was able to make a guess,
because he had to try things until

298
00:25:51 --> 00:25:59
he found something that would work,
that this was what's used in DNA

299
00:25:59 --> 00:26:06
synthesis.
So this hydroxyl ultimately attacks

300
00:26:06 --> 00:26:13
this phosphate here.
And these two other phosphates then

301
00:26:13 --> 00:26:21
come off as a leaving group.
So if we thought of it as a pea

302
00:26:21 --> 00:26:28
like this with two more peas here,
these two come off and you get a new

303
00:26:28 --> 00:26:36
bond formed to the phosphate.
And so what Kornberg then was able

304
00:26:36 --> 00:26:45
to find by using a DNA template that
had this sort of structure and

305
00:26:45 --> 00:26:54
[TTATA?] like this,
that he was now able to get an A

306
00:26:54 --> 00:27:04
added here.  This hydroxyl here
became the new hydroxyl.

307
00:27:04 --> 00:27:10
And so the direction of synthesis,
this strand is the other way, so the

308
00:27:10 --> 00:27:16
direction of synthesis of a DNA
polymerase, it's polymerizing in the

309
00:27:16 --> 00:27:22
5 prime to two 3 prime direction.
This was again an amazing discovery

310
00:27:22 --> 00:27:28
because it was the first time that
anyone had found an enzyme

311
00:27:28 --> 00:27:34
that could copy DNA.
Arthur Kornberg got a Nobel Prize

312
00:27:34 --> 00:27:38
for it.  But at this point actually
genetics came in because there was a

313
00:27:38 --> 00:27:43
scientist John Cairns who was at
that point down at Cold Spring

314
00:27:43 --> 00:27:47
Harbor, as I told you the other day.
And John, in spite of the fact that

315
00:27:47 --> 00:27:52
Arthur had found a DNA polymerase
that had all the properties that you

316
00:27:52 --> 00:27:56
would expect for copying DNA,
didn't think that was the one that

317
00:27:56 --> 00:28:01
actually copied the DNA necessary
for cellular replication.

318
00:28:01 --> 00:28:05
So he reasoned if he was right he'd
be able to find a mutation that

319
00:28:05 --> 00:28:09
would eliminate the activity of that
enzyme and the cell would still live.

320
00:28:09 --> 00:28:13
And so they did a screening,
and it was a lot of work, but they

321
00:28:13 --> 00:28:18
eventually found a mutant of E.
coli that lacked this DNA polymerase

322
00:28:18 --> 00:28:22
that Arthur Kornberg had discovered.
And the cell was still alive and

323
00:28:22 --> 00:28:26
was still replicating its DNA.
So it told both John and then

324
00:28:26 --> 00:28:31
Arthur there must be another
enzyme in the cell.

325
00:28:31 --> 00:28:34
And so Arthur went back.
And now working in a mutant that

326
00:28:34 --> 00:28:37
was missing this first polymerase he
discovered he found the one that

327
00:28:37 --> 00:28:40
really replicates the DNA.
The first one is important,

328
00:28:40 --> 00:28:44
too.  It's needed for DNA repair.
I'm going to talk to you about that

329
00:28:44 --> 00:28:47
in next lecture,
but it's not absolutely crucial for

330
00:28:47 --> 00:28:50
life.  And there's an interplay of
genetics and biochemistry.

331
00:28:50 --> 00:28:53
And you'll see I'm just sort of
foreshadowing what we're going to

332
00:28:53 --> 00:28:57
get to when we talk about
the genetics of this.

333
00:28:57 --> 00:29:00
And I know a couple of you clearly
were frustrated about me showing you

334
00:29:00 --> 00:29:03
pictures of the people who did this,
but nevertheless since this was such

335
00:29:03 --> 00:29:07
a historic event a couple of years
ago at Cold Spring Harbor.

336
00:29:07 --> 00:29:10
This you see the helix model down
there.  There was Jim Watson opening

337
00:29:10 --> 00:29:14
the symposium.
When I got up to talk I said,

338
00:29:14 --> 00:29:17
well, I told my students that I'd
let them know what it was like when

339
00:29:17 --> 00:29:21
I was there, so I took out a camera
and I took a picture of the audience.

340
00:29:21 --> 00:29:24
And so there are a bunch of Nobel
Laureates and types here who were

341
00:29:24 --> 00:29:28
sitting there smiling for you guys
in the class.  And there was Arthur

342
00:29:28 --> 00:29:32
Kornberg giving his talk.
Now, these DNA polymerases are

343
00:29:32 --> 00:29:36
incredible protein machines.
The crystal structures of DNA

344
00:29:36 --> 00:29:40
polymerases operating their template
have been solved.

345
00:29:40 --> 00:29:44
And you can solve,
depending on how many diffractions

346
00:29:44 --> 00:29:48
you can get, you can get a model
that's more and more detailed.

347
00:29:48 --> 00:29:52
And there have been very high
resolution models of DNA polymerases.

348
00:29:52 --> 00:29:56
This blue and white stuff is the
surface of the protein,

349
00:29:56 --> 00:30:00
and this is sort of a template and
the various parts.

350
00:30:00 --> 00:30:04
Just to give you an idea here are
these tracings of the shapes of the

351
00:30:04 --> 00:30:08
electron density.
You can see how the

352
00:30:08 --> 00:30:12
crystallographers have fit the
nucleotides right in the crystal

353
00:30:12 --> 00:30:17
into these electron densities.
And here putting it together a bit

354
00:30:17 --> 00:30:21
in the blue is the secondary
structure of the protein and the

355
00:30:21 --> 00:30:25
templates and whatnot.
And I don't expect you to see very

356
00:30:25 --> 00:30:29
much in that, but the point is I
wanted to sort of just set you up to

357
00:30:29 --> 00:30:34
show you this little movie.
Because DNA polymerases are

358
00:30:34 --> 00:30:38
incredible machines.
They copy at about a thousand

359
00:30:38 --> 00:30:43
nucleotides a second and their
accuracy is really amazing.

360
00:30:43 --> 00:30:47
And I'll tell you all the tricks to
the accuracy in the next lecture,

361
00:30:47 --> 00:30:52
but I want to show you this little
movie because this is sort of a

362
00:30:52 --> 00:30:56
simulation of what must happen every
time a nucleotide is added.

363
00:30:56 --> 00:31:01
Now, we'll see this over and over
again so I'll take it in pieces.

364
00:31:01 --> 00:31:04
The yellow and the orange are the
secondary structures.

365
00:31:04 --> 00:31:08
That's an alpha helix.
And certainly one thing you can see

366
00:31:08 --> 00:31:12
is happening, as we're looking at
this, is the parts of the protein

367
00:31:12 --> 00:31:16
are moving during this.
So you can see this alpha helix

368
00:31:16 --> 00:31:20
that's sort of swinging up and
swinging back down.

369
00:31:20 --> 00:31:24
Now, what's over here is the
template base.

370
00:31:24 --> 00:31:28
That's the base that correspondents
to the T that I was just

371
00:31:28 --> 00:31:31
showing you here.
This is the incoming nucleotide.

372
00:31:31 --> 00:31:35
There is the triphosphate coming
down here.  And,

373
00:31:35 --> 00:31:39
in fact, you just see those two
phosphates going.

374
00:31:39 --> 00:31:43
So what's happening here,
this is going to be the end of the

375
00:31:43 --> 00:31:46
growing chain.
It's going attack right there,

376
00:31:46 --> 00:31:50
join the phosphate and the
pyrophosphate will leave.

377
00:31:50 --> 00:31:54
And if you'll take a look,
when you see this movement of this

378
00:31:54 --> 00:31:58
helix from the beginning state to up
to here, you'll see what happens.

379
00:31:58 --> 00:32:02
It's squeezing the template base and
the incoming nucleotide together.

380
00:32:02 --> 00:32:07
What it's really doing is testing
for the correct shape.

381
00:32:07 --> 00:32:11
Remember the shape of an A-T base
pair and a G-C base pair is the same.

382
00:32:11 --> 00:32:16
And if those of you who are
confused about guanine and the

383
00:32:16 --> 00:32:21
keto-enol thing,
try to draw hydrogen bonds with the

384
00:32:21 --> 00:32:25
enol form of guanine and see how you
do.  I think you'll begin

385
00:32:25 --> 00:32:30
to understand a bit.
So at the heart of life is something

386
00:32:30 --> 00:32:36
that can copy DNA.
And there are these exquisitely

387
00:32:36 --> 00:32:42
beautiful machines.
The replica machine in E.

388
00:32:42 --> 00:32:48
coli has 18 proteins and the ones in
our bodies are even more

389
00:32:48 --> 00:32:54
sophisticated with even more parts.
OK.  But to replicate a DNA

390
00:32:54 --> 00:33:00
molecule there's another
problem that comes up.

391
00:33:00 --> 00:33:18
Because DNA polymerases copy --

392
00:33:18 --> 00:33:23
-- and grow chains in a 5 prime to 3
prime direction.

393
00:33:23 --> 00:33:36
And they need a 3 prime hydroxy

394
00:33:36 --> 00:33:43
terminus.  So they won't work if you
just gave it a single strand of DNA.

395
00:33:43 --> 00:33:51
No DNA polymerase can handle that.
It has to have something like this

396
00:33:51 --> 00:34:03
where there's a template strand --

397
00:34:03 --> 00:34:07
-- and there's what's known as the
primer strand.

398
00:34:07 --> 00:34:11
So there has to be something that
has the 3 prime hydroxyl and there

399
00:34:11 --> 00:34:16
has to be something that's going to
provide the template that's going to

400
00:34:16 --> 00:34:20
be copied.  So if we pull strands
apart like this with 5 prime to 3

401
00:34:20 --> 00:34:24
prime then they'll be 5 prime to 3
prime running in the opposite

402
00:34:24 --> 00:34:31
direction.
If we have a template like this,

403
00:34:31 --> 00:34:39
this is OK because the strand here
can be copied 5 prime to 3 prime.

404
00:34:39 --> 00:34:48
This is the new strand being
synthesized by the DNA polymerase.

405
00:34:48 --> 00:34:56
But what about the other strand?
The replication fork is moving in

406
00:34:56 --> 00:35:03
this direction, but if the --
So here is the 3 to 5 prime

407
00:35:03 --> 00:35:08
direction here.
So if the DNA polymerase is going

408
00:35:08 --> 00:35:13
to be copying this strand it's going
to be moving backwards to the

409
00:35:13 --> 00:35:17
direction of the replication fork.
Now, I guess evolution and nature

410
00:35:17 --> 00:35:22
could have selected for two types of
DNA polymerases,

411
00:35:22 --> 00:35:27
one that copies 5 prime to 3 prime
and one that copies in the opposite

412
00:35:27 --> 00:35:32
direction.   But it didn't.
And there are a number of

413
00:35:32 --> 00:35:36
theoretical reasons that we could
discuss in a more advanced course

414
00:35:36 --> 00:35:40
perhaps for why that is true.
But, in fact, what it does is it

415
00:35:40 --> 00:35:44
uses the same polymerase.
So as these things peel apart the

416
00:35:44 --> 00:35:48
polymerase works in the other
direction, but there's another

417
00:35:48 --> 00:35:52
problem.  If I just peel it apart
like this there's no 3 prime

418
00:35:52 --> 00:35:56
hydroxyl.  So it took people quite a
few years to figure out the strategy

419
00:35:56 --> 00:36:01
that's used in nature.
Nature has a special enzyme that

420
00:36:01 --> 00:36:08
makes a little piece of RNA.
It's called an RNA primer.  And

421
00:36:08 --> 00:36:15
what it does is it provides a 3
prime hydroxyl.

422
00:36:15 --> 00:36:22
And once you have the 3 prime
hydroxyl at the end of the little

423
00:36:22 --> 00:36:29
RNA chain then the
DNA polymerase --

424
00:36:29 --> 00:36:39
-- can be made 5 prime to 3 prime.

425
00:36:39 --> 00:36:47
So as you peel open the replication
fork then little pieces of RNA are

426
00:36:47 --> 00:36:55
used to make a new strand of DNA and
it goes this way.

427
00:36:55 --> 00:37:03
Now that obviously doesn't give you
a new intact DNA strand.

428
00:37:03 --> 00:37:08
And part of the clue to this working
out what was going on at DNA

429
00:37:08 --> 00:37:13
replication was the recognition that
newly synthesized DNA was made as

430
00:37:13 --> 00:37:18
little pieces.
And then later it got joined into

431
00:37:18 --> 00:37:23
longer pieces.
And the person who discovered this

432
00:37:23 --> 00:37:28
was Okazaki.  So these fragments of
DNA that are synthesized initially

433
00:37:28 --> 00:37:34
are called Okazaki fragments,
after the person who discovered this.

434
00:37:34 --> 00:37:38
It was rather puzzling because when
you tried to look at the synthesis

435
00:37:38 --> 00:37:42
of DNA you're looking at a long
molecule, and you found some of the

436
00:37:42 --> 00:37:47
newly synthesized material was in
short pieces.  And as you watched

437
00:37:47 --> 00:37:51
over time it got longer.
So the cell, I think you can sort

438
00:37:51 --> 00:37:55
of see from first principles what
has to happen here then.

439
00:37:55 --> 00:37:06
That in order to come and make --

440
00:37:06 --> 00:37:10
This strand is pretty easy to do,
but what the cells have to do now is

441
00:37:10 --> 00:37:14
they've got these little
RNA primers.

442
00:37:14 --> 00:38:25
And then they remove the RNA by an

443
00:38:25 --> 00:38:32
enzyme that's capable of degrading
the DNA or clipping it

444
00:38:32 --> 00:38:38
at the junction.
And that then leaves the cell in

445
00:38:38 --> 00:38:43
this sort of situation where there
are little tiny gaps in between

446
00:38:43 --> 00:38:48
these pieces of DNA.
But at the end of each one of these

447
00:38:48 --> 00:38:53
is a 3 prime hydroxyl.
So another polymerase or one or

448
00:38:53 --> 00:38:58
another polymerase in the cell can
fill those little pieces

449
00:38:58 --> 00:39:04
of DNA out.
And then there's one little nick

450
00:39:04 --> 00:39:10
that needs to be sealed.
And so what you finally end up with

451
00:39:10 --> 00:39:16
is a 3 prime hydroxyl here,
a 5 prime phosphate that's at the

452
00:39:16 --> 00:39:22
other end, and then these are joined
together.  This is one nucleotide

453
00:39:22 --> 00:39:28
here and the other here.
These are then joined together to

454
00:39:28 --> 00:39:34
give the ordinary phosphodiester
bond that links --

455
00:39:34 --> 00:39:41
-- the two nucleotides together like

456
00:39:41 --> 00:39:46
that.  And the enzyme that does that
is an enzyme called DNA ligase.

457
00:39:46 --> 00:39:51
You can almost think about it as
DNA Scotch tape that will take a

458
00:39:51 --> 00:39:56
little nick in DNA,
if we've got a phosphate and

459
00:39:56 --> 00:40:01
hydroxyl, and it will
join them together.

460
00:40:01 --> 00:40:06
So this process of replication,
which can go at about a thousand

461
00:40:06 --> 00:40:12
nucleotides a second with this
amazing degree of accuracy,

462
00:40:12 --> 00:40:17
uses two different DNA polymerases,
both of which biochemically can only

463
00:40:17 --> 00:40:23
go in one direction.
But you can see they have to be

464
00:40:23 --> 00:40:28
somehow oriented so that one of them
is able to move in this direction

465
00:40:28 --> 00:40:34
and the other one is able to move in
that direction.

466
00:40:34 --> 00:40:38
The key part in this sort of the
course is to try and understand this

467
00:40:38 --> 00:40:42
5 to 3 prime and to get this basic
idea that nature had to do something.

468
00:40:42 --> 00:40:47
It was fairly easy to copy one
strand because that was sort of the

469
00:40:47 --> 00:40:51
direction of the polymerase movement
was the same as the replication for

470
00:40:51 --> 00:40:55
it movement, but the other strand
had to have been much

471
00:40:55 --> 00:40:59
more a problem.
And so when you get down to a

472
00:40:59 --> 00:41:03
biochemical level,
though, it's very conceptually easy

473
00:41:03 --> 00:41:07
to say, oh, you've got complimentary
strands so we just take it apart,

474
00:41:07 --> 00:41:11
we take the photograph and the
negative and we make the opposite

475
00:41:11 --> 00:41:14
one and now we've got two copies.
When you get down to the

476
00:41:14 --> 00:41:18
biochemical details there is this
major biochemical issue of whether

477
00:41:18 --> 00:41:22
the polymerase can go in the 3 prime
or the 5 prime direction.

478
00:41:22 --> 00:41:26
And nature has chosen to do it all
or has been selected to do it all

479
00:41:26 --> 00:41:30
somehow with a polymerase
going in one direction.

480
00:41:30 --> 00:41:35
There are many other aspects to DNA
replication.  And one of the tricks

481
00:41:35 --> 00:41:40
that I find most fascinating is that
these polymerases,

482
00:41:40 --> 00:41:45
once they get on DNA they stay on.
And that's part of the secret

483
00:41:45 --> 00:41:50
because it takes about a millisecond
to add a nucleotide,

484
00:41:50 --> 00:41:55
but if it comes off the DNA it has
to get back on.  Then it

485
00:41:55 --> 00:42:00
takes about a minute.
So the whole trick to being a very,

486
00:42:00 --> 00:42:04
very fast DNA polymerase is to
somehow hang onto the DNA.

487
00:42:04 --> 00:42:08
So what biochemists did was they
purified the actual enzymatic

488
00:42:08 --> 00:42:12
activity that could carry out this
process, and then they started to

489
00:42:12 --> 00:42:16
look for other protein factors that
would help the process to work

490
00:42:16 --> 00:42:20
better.  And they discovered
something called a processivity

491
00:42:20 --> 00:42:24
factor which made the polymerase
stay on the DNA.

492
00:42:24 --> 00:42:28
And people wondered for a lot of
years how that worked and why did

493
00:42:28 --> 00:42:33
this system work so well.
And finally the crystal structure of

494
00:42:33 --> 00:42:38
the processivity factor was
discovered.  And if I go back to

495
00:42:38 --> 00:42:43
this sort of diagram where this is
the piece of DNA that's copied,

496
00:42:43 --> 00:42:48
what it turned out was that the
processivity factor is basically a

497
00:42:48 --> 00:42:53
doughnut that kind of gets clamped
around the DNA like that.

498
00:42:53 --> 00:42:58
So it's sort of like taking a
washer with a place where you can

499
00:42:58 --> 00:43:03
pry it apart opening it up,
putting it around the DNA like this.

500
00:43:03 --> 00:43:07
And then the polymerase,
more or less since this is

501
00:43:07 --> 00:43:11
topologically linked to the DNA,
is like a washer sliding on a wire.

502
00:43:11 --> 00:43:16
This DNA polymerase hangs onto that
and it doesn't come off.

503
00:43:16 --> 00:43:20
And I think there's a little
picture of it.

504
00:43:20 --> 00:43:25
Here's a little movie.
There's the DNA going through and

505
00:43:25 --> 00:43:29
this is one of these clamps.
It's virtually the same structure

506
00:43:29 --> 00:43:34
in a bacterium and inside of us.
But, in fact, the amino acids are

507
00:43:34 --> 00:43:38
almost all different.
But the underlying structure of the

508
00:43:38 --> 00:43:43
protein is almost identical.
And there are special machines

509
00:43:43 --> 00:43:48
called clamp loaders that pry open
this clamps, clamp them around DNA,

510
00:43:48 --> 00:43:52
and that's part of the secret to how
these polymerases are able to

511
00:43:52 --> 00:43:57
polymerize DNA so fast.
There are a lot of other pieces of

512
00:43:57 --> 00:44:02
this machinery.
If you go on you'll hear more about

513
00:44:02 --> 00:44:06
them.  I just want to give you one
of the most recent insights.

514
00:44:06 --> 00:44:10
I mean this, as you might guess,
since DNA replication is at the

515
00:44:10 --> 00:44:14
heart of life it's been studied very,
very hard, ever since the discovery

516
00:44:14 --> 00:44:19
of DNA helix.  My colleague,
Alan Grossman, made quite a

517
00:44:19 --> 00:44:23
discovery just probably three or
four years ago.

518
00:44:23 --> 00:44:27
He took that green fluorescent
protein that we've seen a few times,

519
00:44:27 --> 00:44:31
and he actually joined the gene
encoding green fluorescent protein

520
00:44:31 --> 00:44:36
to the backend of a piece
of the DNA polymerase.

521
00:44:36 --> 00:44:39
So wherever the DNA polymerase went
now there was a little fluorescent

522
00:44:39 --> 00:44:43
molecule.  And he looked to see
where it was in the cell.

523
00:44:43 --> 00:44:47
And I, like many other people,
had for years taught, and this is

524
00:44:47 --> 00:44:50
why, you know,
I have respect for the fact that I'm

525
00:44:50 --> 00:44:54
just teaching you the current model.
For much of my career I taught, so

526
00:44:54 --> 00:44:58
DNA polymerase is sort of like a
train going down the tracks a

527
00:44:58 --> 00:45:03
thousand molecules per second.
And we're doing all this stuff with

528
00:45:03 --> 00:45:09
the leading and with the two strands.
So let me just put those words up

529
00:45:09 --> 00:45:15
while I'm up there.
This one is called,

530
00:45:15 --> 00:45:22
this strand that's easy to replicate
is called the leading strand.

531
00:45:22 --> 00:45:28
And this one where you have to do
the primer and whatnot is called the

532
00:45:28 --> 00:45:33
lagging strand.
In any case, what I had taught was

533
00:45:33 --> 00:45:37
that polymerase was like a train
running on tracks.

534
00:45:37 --> 00:45:41
You could calculate how fast it
would move.  What Alan,

535
00:45:41 --> 00:45:45
to his amazing I imagine,
found was when he looked to see

536
00:45:45 --> 00:45:48
where the DNA polymerase was,
it wasn't spread out all over the

537
00:45:48 --> 00:45:52
cell as if you thought it was a
thing running on tracks.

538
00:45:52 --> 00:45:56
In fact, it was in the center of
the cell.  And then late in cell

539
00:45:56 --> 00:46:00
division it split into two spots
that went to the midpoints of what

540
00:46:00 --> 00:46:04
would be the daughter cells.
And so what he ended up realizing

541
00:46:04 --> 00:46:09
from that was that instead it was
more as if the polymerase was a

542
00:46:09 --> 00:46:14
factory and it pulled the DNA
through it rather than it traveling

543
00:46:14 --> 00:46:19
down the tracks of the DNA.
And that was a very surprising

544
00:46:19 --> 00:46:24
discovery that went against all the
dogma and all the pictures in the

545
00:46:24 --> 00:46:30
textbook. And it was
a discovery at MIT.

546
00:46:30 --> 00:46:34
That was published in,
I think it was 2001, something like

547
00:46:34 --> 00:46:39
that, a very recent discovery.
Things keep changing.  That's again

548
00:46:39 --> 00:46:43
why I keep emphasizing I cannot
teach you a fact in biology.

549
00:46:43 --> 00:46:48
I can teach you the best
understanding we have that explains

550
00:46:48 --> 00:46:52
the experiments to date.
But somebody may make a discovery

551
00:46:52 --> 00:46:57
tomorrow.  That means we'll have to
change our understanding.

552
00:46:57 --> 00:47:00
OK?  So good luck on the exam.
I'll see you on Monday, OK?
