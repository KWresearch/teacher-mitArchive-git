<p></p>
<p>So in the last lecture I spent quite a while trying to convey a sense  of how the structure of DNA was discovered. The crystallographic data  that led to it, as I said, was collected by Rosalind Franklin. And I saw  there was some confusion about this picture that I showed you next.  This is not a photograph of a double helix. This is what happened when  she bounced the x-ray off the crystal of DNA.</p>
<p>This is the  diffraction pattern that she saw. And then one works backwards from that  trying to figure out what kind of structure it was that would have  caused that diffraction pattern. And you have to be a pretty good x-ray  crystallographer to draw any kind of inferences from that. And there  were people, including Francis Crick, who saw the implications of it  right away. But the point was she collected the data and then two people  that I told you about then whose name you know so well, Jim Watson and  Francis Crick, were the two individuals that came up with the model that  explained the diffraction pattern.</p>
<p>And therefore we learned the  structure of DNA as a double-stranded helix. I also tried to make the  case that it wasn't two geniuses who sat down in the room, took a look  at this and popped up with the model. It was a story of real people with  misadventures and mistakes and recovery from mistakes and so on getting  it. It was also a very small group. And I'm going to take just a very  small minute at the beginning of the class because I have a colleague,  Vernon Ingram who's sitting down here in the front, who was a member of  this very small group with Jim Watson and Francis Crick.</p>
<p>So he was  there where all this happened. And almost nobody in the world has had a  chance in your generation to hear directly from somebody who was there  when it happened. So asked Vernon if he would come and just talk to you  for a little bit just what it was like to be there. Well, thanks,  Graham. You seem to be at a very exciting state in 7.014. This structure  of the secret of life no less.</p>
<p>And it is interesting that  immediately when Watson and Crick put together a model of the DNA  molecule that fit the x-ray data, that was the point, how do you know a  model is correct? Because there are certain distances in the model, and  those have to correlate exactly with the distances of the x-ray spots in  the diffraction pattern that you saw. That is how you know that a model  that you've built to certain specifications corresponds to what the  molecule of itself in the crystal that you're examining actually is  composed of.</p>
<p>It was by sheer accident that I happened to be  working as a biochemist in the MRC, The Medical Research Council lab at  the Cavendish Laboratory where Watson and Crick were working. Sheer  accident. It was a very crowded lab, as Graham said. And that's  something that you should remember. When you're choosing a lab to work  in, always go to a lab that's overcrowded. Never go to a lab where  there's lots of space because a really successful lab attracts so many  coworkers, visitors that it rapidly gets overcrowded.</p>
<p>And that was  the case in this laboratory. The director was Max Perutz. Co-director  John Kendrew doing x-ray crystallography of proteins for almost the  first time, and solving the protein structure. Francis Crick was a  graduate student of Max Perutz's doing his PhD work. And the first thing  I remember about Francis was when I went there as a biochemist to work  with Max Perutz, when I went there, there was this tall gangling guy  constantly circulating between the top floor of the building, his office  in the middle and the x-ray machines at the bottom.</p>
<p>He was  constantly going up and down. And in those days the buildings didn't  have an elevators or lifts as the English called them. So he was in  excellent physical shape. Very crowded, a very modest lab. And what's  usually forgotten is a key member of that group, an engineer, Tony  Broad, key person because he invented what was then the world's best and  most efficient x-ray machine, a rotating anode x-ray machine. And  because to the x-ray crystallographers in that group this machine was  available, because of that they were the preeminent x-ray structure  group in the world.</p>
<p>My job was as a biochemist, protein  biochemist, putting a heavy atom, mercury, very heavy atom into Max  Parutz's hemoglobin crystals in specific places. That has a predictable  effect on the x-ray pattern and that enables the Fourier diagram to be  constructed with real phase values for the x-ray diffractions, for the  physicists among you here. Are there any physicists here? Yeah, I  thought so. That was a big step forward and that was also a big step in  figuring out the structure of the DNA samples semi-crystals that  Professor Walker just referred to.</p>
<p>All dependent on the engineer  Tony Broad who is never mentioned in any of these histories, but without  him this would not have happened. So it was an exciting place to work  in, very exciting. We were all young in those days. And living the lives  of young men and young women with all the complications that arise when  you put a whole bunch of very energetic young men, very energetic young  women together.</p>
<p>And by that I mean the interpersonal  relationships which when you're in a crowded, very active situation can  sometimes interfere. And always very entertaining, I can tell you that. I  could give you chapter and verse. But it isn't really so very different  from people your age now, right? I mean I'm not saying it interferes  with you, sometimes it might. But it was an exciting lab, an exciting  time to be there because we were not the only group trying to figure out  the structure of DNA.</p>
<p>A huge competitor was Linus Pauling at  Caltech who had beaten that same group once before, quite recently, over  the alpha helix, the crucial component of protein structure. He got the  right answer first, 1.5 angstrom reflection, the alpha helix. And our  group, Max Parutz and our group had been wrong. So the group was  smarting under that kind of defeat, if you like.</p>
<p>And competition  is a wonderful spur, as long as you don't let it get out of hand. Well,  needless to say we didn't, but the competition with the Pauling lab was  certainly so severe that we awaited the next letter. You see, in those  days new scientific information arrived not by publications, that too  much too long, but by personal letter. And, in fact, the NIH has put  together all these various letters in the Francis Crick collection.</p>
<p>And  when you have time you should look at those. They're quite interesting  because they tell you in a way a scientific paper does not tell you.  What I feel about my experiment results. What she feels about her  experiment results. What it means to me as a person, to her as a person,  to him as a person. So we were constantly watching the mail and  discussing the news as it came in, mostly over a beer at the pub next  door.</p>
<p>It was very conveniently located. But being a small group  crowded together made communication within our group very easy indeed.  And we had fights. I don't mean physical fights. We had scientific  fights. And as a biochemist I was able to settle a crucial fight among  the crystallographers Crick and Watson who were building the model.  Because, quite frankly, they didn't know much chemistry.</p>
<p>And were  trying to build a model with the wrong confirmation of the peptide bond.  They didn't realize that the peptide bond has two possible  confirmations. And they had at one point a terrible time trying to fit  everything together because they were using the wrong confirmation. I'm  talking about lactam-lactim for those of you who are organic chemists  and it means something, a confirmation.</p>
<p>And once they got the  first confirmation then the model clicked into place. So we all helped,  that's what I'm trying to say. We all helped with one great aim in mind.  It was clear. And you know from what Professor Walker said, that the  DNA structure, in its structure held the clue to crucial physiological  behavior of DNA. And Crick and Watson said this in their first paper,  the structure itself because of its complimentarity gives you an  immediate clue as to how it replicates.</p>
<p>And replication of DNA  structure from generation to generation is, of course, the crucial thing  about DNA. The copying, the precise copying from generation to  generation. And that fell out the of x-ray structure. That's why the  x-ray structure was so very important, because it gave you an immediate  understanding of the role of DNA in modern biology. So that's what we  did. And eventually the people in the group, the group got so  overcrowded they built a huge lab that was beautiful, like any new lab  is.</p>
<p>But the thing I remember most of all was the atmosphere in  that place. So remember, when you go and choose a lab, choose one that's  overcrowded. It will pay off. [APPLAUSE] Thank you so much. That was  really wonderful. Thank you. I don't know if some of you realized quite  how rare that was, this discovery of the structure of DNA. As I said,  probably one of the big discoveries of mankind.</p>
<p>Because, as Vernon  said, you could see so many of the secrets of life as soon as you saw  that structure. Very few people have ever heard from someone who was  there at the time. Maybe you'll forget a bunch of stuff down the line,  but I hope you'll remember you heard somebody who was there when Watson  and Crick were there and maybe his extra piece of advice about choosing a  lab.</p>
<p>To say one thing quickly, some of you I think understood  what I've been trying to do. I spent quite a bit of time talking about  science being done by real people doing real experiments. Thanks for  your comments. A few of you have gone out of your way to say that this  was a total waste of time and you didn't understand why I didn't teach  you something instead of doing something on the test.</p>
<p>Well, I'm  making up the test. And if you don't think there'll be something on  scientific process on the second exam you'll be surprised. So I'm  spending a lot of time on this, and the reason is because you are MIT  students. You know, you can go many places in the country to many high  school biology courses and you can memorize, someone will tell you to  memorize everything that's in the book, and you'll get tested whether  you can memorize it.</p>
<p>You guys are at MIT because you have the  potential to be leaders in whatever you do. I've made the transition  from being an undergrad sort of trying to memorize stuff in a textbook  to working on a cutting-edge. I've made some reasonably significant  discoveries in science, as have my other colleagues in the department,  some of them making greater than I. But nevertheless if you're on the  cutting-edge then you're dealing with all the stuff I'm trying to tell  you about in this thing.</p>
<p>You're working as a part of a group.  There's competition. There are interpersonal relationships. You make  mistakes. You recover from them. You're making inferences. You're  testing models. This is a very complex, very real, very dynamic, very  human interaction. I hope you got a little bit of whiff of that from  Vernon. And I wouldn't be, I'm quite capable of reproducing diagrams  from the textbook without trying to give you a deeper understanding, and  that's what I'm trying to do here.</p>
<p>And I hope if it hasn't made  sense to you by the end that at least a few more of you will get it. And  those of you who I think saw what I was doing I appreciate your telling  me that in the things. These are anonymous so I don't know, but a  couple of you are certainly trying to make it clear that you didn't  think it was worth your time coming to lecture. I'm trying to tell you  why I'm trying to do it.</p>
<p>I'm trying to teach you in a deeper way.  And this is a required course. It's important for your life. I hope some  of you will see that or if you don't see it now you'll see it later in  your career. OK. Now, we're going to talk about DNA replication. I'm  going to start to drive into some of the details that maybe are more the  kind of things you're expecting. I just want to make one quick point  here.</p>
<p>I've talked about cell division and we saw this, how cells  come from other cells going to make more cells. I showed you this little  movie you've seen a few times of a yeast cell dividing, but all cells  divide. Here's a cancer cell dividing. If you get a cancer it's a cell  that's forgotten how to stop dividing and is growing to make a tumor.  There's this cancer cell dividing.</p>
<p>It looks not unlike a yeast on a  molecular level, very, very similar. But there's another point. I told  you how the structure of DNA with the complimentary strands with G  pairing with C and A pairing with T immediately gave rise to an insight  as to how the genetic material could be replicated. And you guys know  that it's held together by hydrogen bonds between base pairs which are  about one-twentieth the strength of the covalent bonds.</p>
<p>So you're  able to peel the strands apart without breaking the covalent bonds. And  then by pairing A with T and G with C and doing that on both strands  then you can end up with two identical copies. And so if you do two  identical copies and you do it again you get eight. One of the things  we've realized over the last two or three years in looking through the  exams is somehow, at least some of the class, didn't connect the  business about cells coming from other cells and DNA duplicating to give  daughter DNA.</p>
<p>And I'm just trying to hammer home the point that  these are related. Every time a cell divides it has to duplicate its  genetic information. That's why I'm going to be telling you about DNA  replication. Here's a picture of that same cancer cell, but watch over  here. This is the DNA. And you see it's doubled. And see how the DNA,  which is the chromosomes, has pulled apart so that at the end you now  have two cells and you've got identical copies of DNA.</p>
<p>So if  you're studying cancer, for example, this sort of thing is relevant to  you. OK. So the issue of how -- Well, before I do that, I'm sorry. Just a  couple of things about DNA replication before I dive into this. So we  all started out as a single cell. I've got a lot more obviously because  I'm made up of a lot of cells. If I took all the DNA in my body and I  wind up all the molecules in it, do you guys have any idea how long that  would be? Who thinks it would reach let's say across the room? OK.</p>
<p>Across  campus? Across Cambridge? Around the world? To the moon? Anybody left?  To the sun? I've got ten to the fourteenth cells. There's about a meter  or two in each cell. 10 to 20 billion miles of DNA in each of our  bodies, human DNA. They would go back and forth to the sun multiple  times. So that much DNA had to get replicated in order for the  fertilized egg we all started out as to become you.</p>
<p>Another thing,  the accuracy of replication is about ten to the minus tenth. Most  people, including myself, don't have a very good feel for exponents. So  that's one mistake in 10 billion. You know, it could be one mistake in  10 to the ninety-ninth. Well, what is one mistake in 10 billion mean? So  let's relate it to something we know. If I was typing let's say an  eight letter word, 60 words a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and  I was as good as DNA replication, how often would I make a mistake? So  you can each think of how long you think that is.</p>
<p>But if I was  good on average, I would make a mistake once every 38 years. So I'm  about to tell you about a process that's absolutely astonishing in terms  of how fast and how much you can do and with an accuracy that goes  beyond what we're used to in our ordinary life. So how does it do this?  It has to be more than just pulling the strands apart.</p>
<p>And there's  been some confusion as to why I'm emphasizing 5 prime and 3 prime.  Well, each of these subunits, each nucleotide, this is a 3 prime  hydroxyl and this is the 5 prime position. If we were joining together  subunits that had a hook and an eye it would make a difference because  it's not the same on both ends. If we're going to start hooking together  it's exactly the same thing when we get to a biochemical level, the 5  prime end is not the same as hydroxyl at the 3 prime end because the  whole thing is asymmetric.</p>
<p>So the enzymes that copy DNA are known  as DNA polymerases. And it was a very difficult challenge to figure out  how they operated, but Arthur Kornberg was the first person to solve  this problem. He was an extraordinarily gifted biochemist. He's still at  Stanford. And what he found was if we have a 5 prime end this would  then be the 3 prime end, and there's a 3 prime hydroxyl which is this  one right here.</p>
<p>And this was paired, say, with a C and A paired  with a T. And let's say a G paired with a C here. And let's say the next  template base was, let's make it a T. What Arthur Kornberg was able to  find was an enzyme activity that catalyzed a template-dependent  replication of DNA. That was critical because he had to find, if you  broke the cells open, somewhere in that gamish of enzymes and things  from inside a cell.</p>
<p>There had to be something that was able to  copy DNA. So in order to do that he had to work out an assay. And he  also had to have some kind of guess as to what the cell would be using  in order to carry out the synthesis. But one thing that was sort of  obvious was a DNA template because that was being copies. But the other  part was you had to have energy to form a covalent bond.</p>
<p>So  somehow there had to be something that was sort of activated with the  energy built into the molecule so that thermodynamically the whole thing  would slide downhill when you made a bond. And he knew that the cell  had triphosphates, just the same type that we talked about when we  talked about ATP. So this would be a deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate.  And he was able to make a guess, because he had to try things until he  found something that would work, that this was what's used in DNA  synthesis.</p>
<p>So this hydroxyl ultimately attacks this phosphate  here. And these two other phosphates then come off as a leaving group.  So if we thought of it as a P like this with two more Ps here, these two  come off and you get a new bond formed to the phosphate. And so what  Kornberg then was able to find by using a DNA template that had this  sort of structure and P, P, P, like this, that he was now able to get an  A added here.</p>
<p>This hydroxyl here became the new hydroxyl. And so  the direction of synthesis, this strand is the other way, so the  direction of synthesis of a DNA polymerase, it's polymerizing in the 5  prime to 3 prime direction. This was again an amazing discovery because  it was the first time that anyone had found an enzyme that could copy  DNA. Arthur Kornberg got a Nobel Prize for it. But at this point  actually genetics came in because there was a scientist John Cairns who  was at that point down at Cold Spring Harbor, as I told you the other  day.</p>
<p>And John, in spite of the fact that Arthur had found a DNA  polymerase that had all the properties that you would expect for copying  DNA, didn't think that was the one that actually copied the DNA  necessary for cellular replication. So he reasoned if he was right he'd  be able to find a mutation that would eliminate the activity of that  enzyme and the cell would still live.</p>
<p>And so they did a screen,  and it was a lot of work, but they eventually found a mutant of E. coli  that lacked this DNA polymerase that Arthur Kornberg had discovered. And  the cell was still alive and was still replicating its DNA. So it told  both John and then Arthur there must be another enzyme in the cell. And  so Arthur went back. And now working in a mutant that was missing this  first polymerase he discovered he found the one that really replicates  the DNA.</p>
<p>The first one is important, too. It's needed for DNA  repair. I'm going to talk to you about that in next lecture, but it's  not absolutely crucial for life. And there's an interplay of genetics  and biochemistry. And you'll see I'm just sort of foreshadowing what  we're going to get to when we talk about the genetics of this. And I  know a couple of you clearly were frustrated about me showing you  pictures of the people who did this, but nevertheless since this was  such a historic event a couple of years ago at Cold Spring Harbor.</p>
<p>This  you see the helix model down there. There was Jim Watson opening the  symposium. When I got up to talk I said, well, I told my students that  I'd let them know what it was like when I was there, so I took out a  camera and I took a picture of the audience. And so there are a bunch of  Nobel Laureates and types here who were sitting there smiling for you  guys in the class. And there was Arthur Kornberg giving his talk.</p>
<p>Now,  these DNA polymerases are incredible protein machines. The crystal  structures of DNA polymerases operating their template have been solved.  And you can solve, depending on how many diffractions you can get, you  can get a model that's more and more detailed. And there have been very  high resolution models of DNA polymerases. This blue and white stuff is  the surface of the protein, and this is sort of a template and the  various parts.</p>
<p>Just to give you an idea here are these tracings of  the shapes of the electron density. You can see how the  crystallographers have fit the nucleotides right in the crystal into  these electron densities. And here putting it together a bit in the blue  is the secondary structure of the protein and the templates and  whatnot. And I don't expect you to see very much in that, but the point  is I wanted to sort of just set you up to show you this little movie.</p>
<p>Because  DNA polymerases are incredible machines. They copy at about a thousand  nucleotides a second and their accuracy is really amazing. And I'll tell  you all the tricks to the accuracy in the next lecture, but I want to  show you this little movie because this is sort of a simulation of what  must happen every time a nucleotide is added. Now, we'll see this over  and over again so I'll take it in pieces.</p>
<p>The yellow and the  orange are the secondary structures. That's an alpha helix. And  certainly one thing you can see is happening, as we're looking at this,  is the parts of the protein are moving during this. So you can see this  alpha helix that's sort of swinging up and swinging back down. Now,  what's over here is the template base. That's the base that  correspondents to the T that I was just showing you here.</p>
<p>This is  the incoming nucleotide. There is the triphosphate coming down here.  And, in fact, you just see those two phosphates going. So what's  happening here, this is going to be the end of the growing chain. It's  going attack right there, join the phosphate and the pyrophosphate will  leave. And if you'll take a look, when you see this movement of this  helix from the beginning state to up to here, you'll see what happens.</p>
<p>It's  squeezing the template base and the incoming nucleotide together. What  it's really doing is testing for the correct shape. Remember the shape  of an A-T base pair and a G-C base pair is the same. And if those of you  who are confused about guanine and the keto-enol thing, try to draw  hydrogen bonds with the enol form of guanine and see how you do. I think  you'll begin to understand a bit.</p>
<p>So at the heart of life is  something that can copy DNA. And there are these exquisitely beautiful  machines. The replicative machine in E. coli has 18 proteins and the  ones in our bodies are even more sophisticated with even more parts. OK.  But to replicate a DNA molecule there's another problem that comes up.  Because DNA polymerases copy -- -- and grow chains in a 5 prime to 3  prime direction.</p>
<p>And they need a 3 prime hydroxy terminus. So they  won't work if you just gave it a single strand of DNA. No DNA  polymerase can handle that. It has to have something like this where  there's a template strand -- -- and there's what's known as the primer  strand. So there has to be something that has the 3 prime hydroxyl and  there has to be something that's going to provide the template that's  going to be copied.</p>
<p>So if we pull strands apart like this with 5  prime to 3 prime then they'll be 5 prime to 3 prime running in the  opposite direction. If we have a template like this, this is OK because  the strand here can be copied 5 prime to 3 prime. This is the new strand  being synthesized by the DNA polymerase. But what about the other  strand? The replication fork is moving in this direction, but if the --  So here is the 3 to 5 prime direction here.</p>
<p>So if the DNA  polymerase is going to be copying this strand it's going to be moving  backwards to the direction of the replication fork. Now, I guess  evolution and nature could have selected for two types of DNA  polymerases, one that copies 5 prime to 3 prime and one that copies in  the opposite direction. But it didn't. And there are a number of  theoretical reasons that we could discuss in a more advanced course  perhaps for why that is true.</p>
<p>But, in fact, what it does is it  uses the same polymerase. So as these things peel apart the polymerase  works in the other direction, but there's another problem. If I just  peel it apart like this there's no 3 prime hydroxyl. So it took people  quite a few years to figure out the strategy that's used in nature.  Nature has a special enzyme that makes a little piece of RNA. It's  called an RNA primer.</p>
<p>And what it does is it provides a 3 prime  hydroxyl. And once you have the 3 prime hydroxyl at the end of the  little RNA chain then the DNA polymerase -- -- can be made 5 prime to 3  prime. So as you peel open the replication fork then little pieces of  RNA are used to make a new strand of DNA and it goes this way. Now that  obviously doesn't give you a new intact DNA strand. And part of the clue  to this working out what was going on at DNA replication was the  recognition that newly synthesized DNA was made as little pieces.</p>
<p>And  then later it got joined into longer pieces. And the person who  discovered this was Okazaki. So these fragments of DNA that are  synthesized initially are called Okazaki fragments, after the person who  discovered this. It was rather puzzling because when you tried to look  at the synthesis of DNA you're looking at a long molecule, and you found  some of the newly synthesized material was in short pieces.</p>
<p>And  as you watched over time it got longer. So the cell, I think you can  sort of see from first principles what has to happen here then. That in  order to come and make -- This strand is pretty easy to do, but what the  cells have to do now is they've got these little RNA primers. And then  they remove the RNA by an enzyme that's capable of degrading the DNA or  clipping it at the junction. And that then leaves the cell in this sort  of situation where there are little tiny gaps in between these pieces of  DNA.</p>
<p>But at the end of each one of these is a 3 prime hydroxyl.  So another polymerase or one or another polymerase in the cell can fill  those little pieces of DNA out. And then there's one little nick that  needs to be sealed. And so what you finally end up with is a 3 prime  hydroxyl here, a 5 prime phosphate that's at the other end, and then  these are joined together.</p>
<p>This is one nucleotide here and the  other here. These are then joined together to give the ordinary  phosphodiester bond that links -- -- the two nucleotides together like  that. And the enzyme that does that is an enzyme called DNA ligase. You  can almost think about it as DNA Scotch tape that will take a little  nick in DNA, if we've got a phosphate and hydroxyl, and it will join  them together. So this process of replication, which can go at about a  thousand nucleotides a second with this amazing degree of accuracy, uses  two different DNA polymerases, both of which biochemically can only go  in one direction.</p>
<p>But you can see they have to be somehow oriented  so that one of them is able to move in this direction and the other one  is able to move in that direction. The key part in this sort of the  course is to try and understand this 5 to 3 prime and to get this basic  idea that nature had to do something. It was fairly easy to copy one  strand because that was sort of the direction of the polymerase movement  was the same as the replication fork movement, but the other strand had  to have been much more a problem.</p>
<p>And so when you get down to a  biochemical level, though, it's very conceptually easy to say, oh,  you've got complimentary strands so we just take it apart, we take the  photograph and the negative and we make the opposite one and now we've  got two copies. When you get down to the biochemical details there is  this major biochemical issue of whether the polymerase can go in the 3  prime or the 5 prime direction.</p>
<p>And nature has chosen to do it all  or has been selected to do it all somehow with a polymerase going in  one direction. There are many other aspects to DNA replication. And one  of the tricks that I find most fascinating is that these polymerases,  once they get on DNA they stay on. And that's part of the secret because  it takes about a millisecond to add a nucleotide, but if it comes off  the DNA it has to get back on.</p>
<p>Then it takes about a minute. So  the whole trick to being a very, very fast DNA polymerase is to somehow  hang onto the DNA. So what biochemists did was they purified the actual  enzymatic activity that could carry out this process, and then they  started to look for other protein factors that would help the process to  work better. And they discovered something called a processivity factor  which made the polymerase stay on the DNA.</p>
<p>And people wondered  for a lot of years how that worked and why did this system work so well.  And finally the crystal structure of the processivity factor was  discovered. And if I go back to this sort of diagram where this is the  piece of DNA that's copied, what it turned out was that the processivity  factor is basically a doughnut that kind of gets clamped around the DNA  like that.</p>
<p>So it's sort of like taking a washer with a place  where you can pry it apart opening it up, putting it around the DNA like  this. And then the polymerase, more or less since this is topologically  linked to the DNA, is like a washer sliding on a wire. This DNA  polymerase hangs onto that and it doesn't come off. And I think there's a  little picture of it.</p>
<p>Here's a little movie. There's the DNA  going through and this is one of these clamps. It's virtually the same  structure in a bacterium and inside of us. But, in fact, the amino acids  are almost all different. But the underlying structure of the protein  is almost identical. And there are special machines called clamp loaders  that pry open this clamps, clamp them around DNA, and that's part of  the secret to how these polymerases are able to polymerize DNA so fast.</p>
<p>There  are a lot of other pieces of this machinery. If you go on you'll hear  more about them. I just want to give you one of the most recent  insights. I mean this, as you might guess, since DNA replication is at  the heart of life it's been studied very, very hard, ever since the  discovery of DNA helix. My colleague, Alan Grossman, made quite a  discovery just probably three or four years ago.</p>
<p>He took that  green fluorescent protein that we've seen a few times, and he actually  joined the gene encoding green fluorescent protein to the backend of a  piece of the DNA polymerase. So wherever the DNA polymerase went now  there was a little fluorescent molecule. And he looked to see where it  was in the cell. And I, like many other people, had for years taught,  and this is why, you know, I have respect for the fact that I'm just  teaching you the current model.</p>
<p>For much of my career I taught, so  DNA polymerase is sort of like a train going down the tracks a thousand  molecules per second. And we're doing all this stuff with the leading  and with the two strands. So let me just put those words up while I'm up  there. This one is called, this strand that's easy to replicate is  called the leading strand. And this one where you have to do the primer  and whatnot is called the lagging strand.</p>
<p>In any case, what I had  taught was that polymerase was like a train running on tracks. You could  calculate how fast it would move. What Alan, to his amazement, found  was when he looked to see where the DNA polymerase was, it wasn't spread  out all over the cell as if you thought it was a thing running on  tracks. In fact, it was in the center of the cell. And then late in cell  division it split into two spots that went to the midpoints of what  would be the daughter cells.</p>
<p>And so what he ended up realizing  from that was that instead it was more as if the polymerase was a  factory and it pulled the DNA through it rather than it traveling down  the tracks of the DNA. And that was a very surprising discovery that  went against all the dogma and all the pictures in the textbook. And it  was a discovery at MIT. That was published in, I think it was 2001,  something like that, a very recent discovery.</p>
<p>Things keep  changing. That's again why I keep emphasizing I cannot teach you a fact  in biology. I can teach you the best understanding we have that explains  the experiments to date. But somebody may make a discovery tomorrow.  That means we'll have to change our understanding. OK? So good luck on  the exam. I?ll see you on Monday, OK?</p>
