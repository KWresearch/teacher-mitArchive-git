1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
This lecture is going to be very
dependent upon the PowerPoint slides,

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:09
because if I take the time to draw
the cycles on the board,

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:14
we'd be here forever.  So I would
say sit back and relax because you

4
00:00:14 --> 00:00:19
have the slides.
They're on the Web.

5
00:00:19 --> 00:00:24
And try to focus on what the
take-home message is.

6
00:00:24 --> 00:00:29
OK, but before we go on to
biogeochemical cycles,

7
00:00:29 --> 00:00:34
I want to just briefly review some
of the things that we learned in the

8
00:00:34 --> 00:00:39
second lecture.
I got feedback from many of you,

9
00:00:39 --> 00:00:43
actually, on the things that were
difficult to understand from that

10
00:00:43 --> 00:00:48
lecture, and those are important for
understanding these cycles.

11
00:00:48 --> 00:00:52
And the one thing that some people
were confused by was this anaerobic

12
00:00:52 --> 00:00:57
respiration.  Remember,
I drew this on the board,

13
00:00:57 --> 00:01:02
and it showed a lot of reduction
reactions.

14
00:01:02 --> 00:01:06
And I think that was confusing for
some people, so let's just go over

15
00:01:06 --> 00:01:11
that very quickly.
You've learned in Graham's lectures,

16
00:01:11 --> 00:01:15
and in my lectures,
that anaerobic respiration,

17
00:01:15 --> 00:01:20
respiration of organisms where there
is oxygen, that oxygen is the

18
00:01:20 --> 00:01:24
terminal electron receptor here in
that electron transport chain and

19
00:01:24 --> 00:01:29
it's reduced to water.
So in aerobic environments,

20
00:01:29 --> 00:01:33
when organisms respire oxygen it's
reduced to water.

21
00:01:33 --> 00:01:37
If there's no oxygen around,
the organisms, and in this case it's

22
00:01:37 --> 00:01:41
always bacteria,
look for the next thermodynamically

23
00:01:41 --> 00:01:45
favorable electron acceptor.
And so, whatever is dominant in

24
00:01:45 --> 00:01:49
that environment and is most
thermodynamically favorable,

25
00:01:49 --> 00:01:53
they'll use.  So, the sulfate
reducing organisms use sulfate and

26
00:01:53 --> 00:01:57
reduce at [H2S?
.  Denied trying denitrifying

27
00:01:57 --> 00:02:01
organisms use nitrate and reduce it
to these forms of reduced nitrate or

28
00:02:01 --> 00:02:06
reduce nitrogen.
And we talked about iron bacteria

29
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
[epi?] plus three,
and reduce it to epi plus two.

30
00:02:10 --> 00:02:14
Some can use manganese, etc.
Whatever's there,

31
00:02:14 --> 00:02:18
and it's thermodynamically favorable,
they'll use.  OK,

32
00:02:18 --> 00:02:22
so that clarifies that.
Some of the people said,

33
00:02:22 --> 00:02:26
you kept talking about symmetry.
You kept talking about symmetry.

34
00:02:26 --> 00:02:30
I didn't see any symmetry, and in
hindsight I can understand why,

35
00:02:30 --> 00:02:35
because it just threw that out and I
didn't really point it out.

36
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
So what I was talking about was as
we went through these processes,

37
00:02:39 --> 00:02:44
you see here, these elements,
sulfate and nitrogen,

38
00:02:44 --> 00:02:49
nitrate, are being reduced.
There are other processes,

39
00:02:49 --> 00:02:53
particularly chemosynthesis in which
these reduced compounds,

40
00:02:53 --> 00:02:58
here's H2S and ammonia or be
oxidized.  So that's the symmetry

41
00:02:58 --> 00:03:03
that I was talking about.
And if you didn't have that,

42
00:03:03 --> 00:03:07
if all the organisms were reducing
things, the whole system would run

43
00:03:07 --> 00:03:12
down.  You have to have organisms
that are also oxidizing things.

44
00:03:12 --> 00:03:16
And that's a key component of all
of these, or not all of the

45
00:03:16 --> 00:03:21
biogeochemical cycles,
but particularly the cycles of

46
00:03:21 --> 00:03:25
nitrogen and sulfur,
which have this [redox?

47
00:03:25 --> 00:03:30
chemistry.  So that's a symmetry
that I was talking about.

48
00:03:30 --> 00:03:36
OK, now so let's talk about how we
think about biogeochemical cycles.

49
00:03:36 --> 00:03:42
Did you see the slide in the back?
Try to turn the lights off?  That

50
00:03:42 --> 00:03:49
was a double question.
Can you see the slide in the back?

51
00:03:49 --> 00:03:55
Yes?  OK.  So this is a generic map
of the components of biogeochemical

52
00:03:55 --> 00:04:02
cycles.  And we can think of the
earth as a giant chemical factory in

53
00:04:02 --> 00:04:08
the sense that has what we call
compartments, or reservoirs,

54
00:04:08 --> 00:04:14
or pools of a particular element.
Or it might be water that we are

55
00:04:14 --> 00:04:19
analyzing, and then there are fluxes
between these pools.

56
00:04:19 --> 00:04:23
So here's a flux, an arrow.
So typically these are diagrammed

57
00:04:23 --> 00:04:28
with boxes and arrows connecting
them.  And you don't have to use all

58
00:04:28 --> 00:04:33
of these boxes.
It could be we are just looking at

59
00:04:33 --> 00:04:37
land, atmosphere,
and ocean.  I mean,

60
00:04:37 --> 00:04:41
you can construct whatever model you
want cities.  And these are just

61
00:04:41 --> 00:04:46
some useful conversion factors for
the amount of things that we're

62
00:04:46 --> 00:04:50
going to have flowing between these
compartments.  And here,

63
00:04:50 --> 00:04:54
again, this is something we defined
earlier when we were talking about

64
00:04:54 --> 00:04:59
productivity.  The main residence
time of, say, an element,

65
00:04:59 --> 00:05:03
say, carbon in the terrestrial
biomass, is the pool size,

66
00:05:03 --> 00:05:07
the amount of carbon that they're
divided by the mean flux in or out

67
00:05:07 --> 00:05:12
of the pool, OK?
It's exactly the same concept we

68
00:05:12 --> 00:05:16
talked about for carbon.
And then the fractional turnover,

69
00:05:16 --> 00:05:20
one over the mean residence time is
simply the fraction.

70
00:05:20 --> 00:05:24
If we're talking about carbon again
in trees, it's the fraction that's

71
00:05:24 --> 00:05:29
removed per unit time.
OK, so you can see that when we talk

72
00:05:29 --> 00:05:34
about mean residence time of an
element  in one of these reservoirs,

73
00:05:34 --> 00:05:39
if the whole system is in a steady
state, in other words,

74
00:05:39 --> 00:05:44
if the amount in a reservoir is
changing, the flux in is going to be

75
00:05:44 --> 00:05:50
the same as the flux out,
right?  You know that.  Just like a

76
00:05:50 --> 00:05:55
bathtub, if you have water flowing
in, water flowing out,

77
00:05:55 --> 00:06:00
the level will say the same if the
flow rate and is the same

78
00:06:00 --> 00:06:05
as the flow rate out.
But often in nature,

79
00:06:05 --> 00:06:09
you don't have that exactly.
And if you don't, the size of these

80
00:06:09 --> 00:06:13
reservoirs is either increasing or
decreasing.  So when you're

81
00:06:13 --> 00:06:17
analyzing these systems,
your most of the time trying to get

82
00:06:17 --> 00:06:22
the very rough estimate of main
residence time.

83
00:06:22 --> 00:06:26
So if the flow in and the flow out
isn't the same,

84
00:06:26 --> 00:06:30
you can either average them and use
that as your flux,

85
00:06:30 --> 00:06:34
or you could define your residence
time with respect to the flow

86
00:06:34 --> 00:06:39
in or the flow out.
So, these are just gross

87
00:06:39 --> 00:06:43
approximations.
What we want to understand is the

88
00:06:43 --> 00:06:47
residence time thousands of years,
millions of years, days, rough

89
00:06:47 --> 00:06:51
approximation.
And the other thing I want to say

90
00:06:51 --> 00:06:55
before we go on,
is that all of these cycles,

91
00:06:55 --> 00:06:59
we're going to talk about them
element by element: phosphorus,

92
00:06:59 --> 00:07:03
carbon, whatever.
But they're all tightly coupled in

93
00:07:03 --> 00:07:08
the system.  And we'll bring that up
again later.  Before we go on,

94
00:07:08 --> 00:07:14
let's just look at the solar energy
budget, which is driving this whole

95
00:07:14 --> 00:07:19
system, mostly,
there is some geothermal energy,

96
00:07:19 --> 00:07:24
energy for the Earth's, the magma
that is also driving biogeochemical

97
00:07:24 --> 00:07:30
cycles.  But the solar energy is the
primary driver.

98
00:07:30 --> 00:07:35
And if you say that the total energy
from the sun is 100%,

99
00:07:35 --> 00:07:40
it's that energy that is used in
evaporation, and winds,

100
00:07:40 --> 00:07:45
and photosynthesis that is the
important component driving the

101
00:07:45 --> 00:07:50
cycles.  And you'll see that
photosynthesis is a tiny fraction.

102
00:07:50 --> 00:07:56
The energy that plants harvest is a
tiny fraction of the total energy

103
00:07:56 --> 00:08:01
that is driving the Earth's system.
And yet, this photosynthesis, which

104
00:08:01 --> 00:08:06
is the basis of the biosphere,
has an enormous effect on the

105
00:08:06 --> 00:08:11
conditions on Earth.
That's an interesting nonlinearity

106
00:08:11 --> 00:08:15
of the system.
OK, so let's start with the

107
00:08:15 --> 00:08:19
geological cycle,
which is the slowest moving,

108
00:08:19 --> 00:08:24
people don't even think of it as a
cycle because while we are on Earth

109
00:08:24 --> 00:08:28
we don't see rocks flying through,
well, sometimes you see rocks in a

110
00:08:28 --> 00:08:32
landslide or whatever,
but for the most part you don't

111
00:08:32 --> 00:08:37
think of rocks as cycling.
But they do.  And if they didn't,

112
00:08:37 --> 00:08:41
the system would run down much
faster than it is.

113
00:08:41 --> 00:08:45
And we've all heard about plate
tectonics, that the surface of the

114
00:08:45 --> 00:08:49
Earth is made up of these plates
that are slowly shifting.

115
00:08:49 --> 00:08:53
And when they shift you have
earthquakes, like we've had recently

116
00:08:53 --> 00:08:57
a lot of.  And also,
you have volcanic eruptions that

117
00:08:57 --> 00:09:01
bring material from the inside of
the Earth up to the surface

118
00:09:01 --> 00:09:05
and it overflows.
And that's part of this geological

119
00:09:05 --> 00:09:09
cycle.  So, here's a really
oversimplified,

120
00:09:09 --> 00:09:14
when the geology professor in our
department so that ever showing this

121
00:09:14 --> 00:09:18
he had a heart attack by how
simplified it is.

122
00:09:18 --> 00:09:23
But it's just so you get the idea.
When he started editing it, there

123
00:09:23 --> 00:09:27
are so many arrows you can never
cope with that.

124
00:09:27 --> 00:09:32
But just get the idea.
There's geothermal energy coming in

125
00:09:32 --> 00:09:37
from the inner core of the Earth
where you have magma.

126
00:09:37 --> 00:09:41
Think volcanic eruption,
lava, which ultimately becomes

127
00:09:41 --> 00:09:45
surface rocks.
And they're eroded by weathering by

128
00:09:45 --> 00:09:49
rain, and then elements from that go
into the soils.

129
00:09:49 --> 00:09:54
Soils eventually become sedimentary
rocks.  We're talking over really,

130
00:09:54 --> 00:09:58
really long time periods, which
become metamorphic rocks.

131
00:09:58 --> 00:10:02
Some of those are uplifted,
and some of them are melted and

132
00:10:02 --> 00:10:07
become magma.
But it is a cycle,

133
00:10:07 --> 00:10:12
a very, very slow cycle.
In fact, somewhere I read 70%,

134
00:10:12 --> 00:10:18
you do not need to know this.  This
is not geology class.

135
00:10:18 --> 00:10:23
But just so you have an idea,
75% of the rocks now on the surface

136
00:10:23 --> 00:10:29
of the earth have been uplifted.
So it's almost as if the Earth is,

137
00:10:29 --> 00:10:35
on average, maybe halfway through a
cycle.  So, this erosion here,

138
00:10:35 --> 00:10:42
and weathering, as we talked about
last time is critical for making

139
00:10:42 --> 00:10:49
nutrients available to the biosphere.
And the force of this weathering is

140
00:10:49 --> 00:10:55
incredibly powerful.
One number that I found it one

141
00:10:55 --> 00:11:02
textbook that I never knew before is
that Niagara Falls is eroding at 3

142
00:11:02 --> 00:11:09
feet per year.
The cusp of the falls from the water

143
00:11:09 --> 00:11:15
is moving back 3 feet per year.
That's fast.  Another little

144
00:11:15 --> 00:11:22
factoid when I gave this lecture one
year, students asked what is going

145
00:11:22 --> 00:11:28
to burn out first on the Earth,
the sun or the geothermal energy?

146
00:11:28 --> 00:11:34
And of course I have no idea.
We over someday.

147
00:11:34 --> 00:11:38
The Earth is going to be history
because without the sun and without

148
00:11:38 --> 00:11:42
the geothermal energy there's no
source of energy.

149
00:11:42 --> 00:11:47
So I went to my colleagues in this
department, Earth Atmosphere and

150
00:11:47 --> 00:11:51
Planetary Sciences,
and said, which is going to burn out

151
00:11:51 --> 00:11:55
first?  And they said,
roughly the same time.  And we have

152
00:11:55 --> 00:12:00
about 2 billion years,
so not to worry yet.

153
00:12:00 --> 00:12:04
But it is, we are only here for a
period of time.

154
00:12:04 --> 00:12:08
So, that's the geologic cycle.
Now, let's move onto the water

155
00:12:08 --> 00:12:12
cycle, and then we're going to go
through the element cycles of

156
00:12:12 --> 00:12:17
nitrogen, phosphorus,
and carbon.  But the water cycle is

157
00:12:17 --> 00:12:21
obviously important in carrying
those elements through their cycles.

158
00:12:21 --> 00:12:25
And the cycle is actually fairly
well understood.

159
00:12:25 --> 00:12:29
As a fairly because not all of
these things, when you're talking

160
00:12:29 --> 00:12:34
about global averages of things it's
very difficult.

161
00:12:34 --> 00:12:39
But the weather service is very
interested in the global water cycle.

162
00:12:39 --> 00:12:44
So there's been a lot of study done.
So in terms of reservoirs,

163
00:12:44 --> 00:12:49
these numbers of black at the amount
of water in a reservoir.

164
00:12:49 --> 00:12:54
And the numbers and blue are the
number of fluxes annually of the

165
00:12:54 --> 00:13:00
amounts of water moving
from one to another.

166
00:13:00 --> 00:13:05
So, there is a lot of water and
groundwater.  There's a lot of water

167
00:13:05 --> 00:13:10
and ice, and there's a lot of water
in the oceans.

168
00:13:10 --> 00:13:15
And there's very little water in
the atmosphere.

169
00:13:15 --> 00:13:20
These are the annual fluxes.
So you can see, if I animated this

170
00:13:20 --> 00:13:25
right, so 111,
these are in terms of square

171
00:13:25 --> 00:13:30
kilometers of water,
that's a lot of water.

172
00:13:30 --> 00:13:35
So, 111 minus 71 gives you 40.
So that's the rainfall.

173
00:13:35 --> 00:13:39
This is the evapotranspiration,
and the net result is 40,000 that is

174
00:13:39 --> 00:13:43
flowing into the oceans.
And in the oceans, here's the

175
00:13:43 --> 00:13:48
evaporation and here's the rainfall
going in with just a net of 40

176
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
that's transported from the oceans
to land.  So you have 40,

177
00:13:52 --> 00:13:56
00 going into the oceans, and 40,
00 coming back, fairly nicely

178
00:13:56 --> 00:14:05
balanced.  That's good.
And so, let's just use this as an

179
00:14:05 --> 00:14:17
example to say,
what's the residence time of water.

180
00:14:17 --> 00:14:30
Let's just calculate this.  We can
just approximated.

181
00:14:30 --> 00:14:42
So the mean residence time is equal
to the pool size divided by the flux,

182
00:14:42 --> 00:14:55
right?  So what's the pool size?
Well, how much water there in the

183
00:14:55 --> 00:15:06
ocean?
Thank you.  [35?

184
00:15:06 --> 00:15:15
times 109.  And,
what's the flux?

185
00:15:15 --> 00:15:31
Well, we have 425,

186
00:15:31 --> 00:15:40
00 evaporating and we have 40 going
here.  So, I would add this and that

187
00:15:40 --> 00:15:48
so it's balanced.
So, I would use 425.

188
00:15:48 --> 00:15:57
4.25 times 105 equals just roughly
how many years?  3,000

189
00:15:57 --> 00:16:04
years roughly.
So we would say the residence time,

190
00:16:04 --> 00:16:09
the average molecule, the average
water molecules floating through

191
00:16:09 --> 00:16:14
this system would spend on average
thousands of years in the oceans

192
00:16:14 --> 00:16:18
before it would evaporate and get
back into the system.

193
00:16:18 --> 00:16:23
So you should now think about what
the average residence time is,

194
00:16:23 --> 00:16:28
for example, in the atmosphere.
And you can see when the pool is

195
00:16:28 --> 00:16:33
very small relative to the fluxes,
the residence time is going to be

196
00:16:33 --> 00:16:38
very short, right?
That's something to remember.

197
00:16:38 --> 00:16:42
When the pool is huge relative to
the fluxes, the residence time is

198
00:16:42 --> 00:16:46
going to be very long.
So, you should think about that as

199
00:16:46 --> 00:16:50
you go through your notes.
But, in oceans, the residence time

200
00:16:50 --> 00:16:55
is thousands of years in groundwater.
The residence time,

201
00:16:55 --> 00:16:59
again, can be very long,
which is why we don't want to

202
00:16:59 --> 00:17:03
contaminate our groundwater because
it's going to take a really long

203
00:17:03 --> 00:17:08
time to flush that through.
Lakes: the residence time is on the

204
00:17:08 --> 00:17:13
order of decades,
streams on the order of weeks,

205
00:17:13 --> 00:17:19
and atmosphere I'll let you
calculate it and figure it out.

206
00:17:19 --> 00:17:24
OK, let's move on now to an element
cycle, the global phosphorous

207
00:17:24 --> 00:17:50
cycle.

208
00:17:50 --> 00:17:56
First of all, there's no [redox?
chemistry in the cycle.  That's

209
00:17:56 --> 00:18:03
important.  OK,
that's the first thing to remember.

210
00:18:03 --> 00:18:09
And it's called a sedimentary cycle
because there is no atmospheric

211
00:18:09 --> 00:18:15
component.  There is essentially no
phosphorus in the atmosphere.

212
00:18:15 --> 00:18:22
Everything in this field, there's
always an exception.

213
00:18:22 --> 00:18:28
There is something called phosphine
that comes out of bogs that is

214
00:18:28 --> 00:18:35
really interesting.
But it's not a huge amount,

215
00:18:35 --> 00:18:41
so it doesn't really matter in this
analysis.  And,

216
00:18:41 --> 00:18:47
let's look at it here.
We have a fair amount of phosphorus

217
00:18:47 --> 00:18:53
in land plants.
And there's internal cycling here.

218
00:18:53 --> 00:19:00
We have the mining of phosphorus
from rocks.

219
00:19:00 --> 00:19:04
This is a fertilizer.
No, that's not a mine; that's a

220
00:19:04 --> 00:19:08
house.  Sorry.
The mine is invisible.

221
00:19:08 --> 00:19:12
Here's the mine.  So, the
phosphorus is being mined.

222
00:19:12 --> 00:19:17
It's put on crops as fertilizer.
The crops are eaten by the people

223
00:19:17 --> 00:19:21
in the house, and the phosphorus
ends up in sewage.

224
00:19:21 --> 00:19:25
Even if it's treated,
it ends up in the rivers,

225
00:19:25 --> 00:19:30
and it ends up flowing into the
oceans.

226
00:19:30 --> 00:19:35
And there's a little bit in dust
transport here,

227
00:19:35 --> 00:19:40
but if you look at this whole system,
it's basically the phosphorous cycle

228
00:19:40 --> 00:19:46
is a one-way flow to the oceans.
The only return of the cycle is via

229
00:19:46 --> 00:19:51
the sedimentary cycle where you go
from sediments.

230
00:19:51 --> 00:19:57
Those are sedimentary rocks until
you go to mineable rock

231
00:19:57 --> 00:20:02
and through uplifting.
And this is on geological timescales.

232
00:20:02 --> 00:20:08
So, on the earth today,
the global phosphorous cycle is

233
00:20:08 --> 00:20:13
really not a cycle.
It's a one-way flow to the oceans.

234
00:20:13 --> 00:20:18
Well, it's a cycle, but it's an
extremely unbalanced cycle because

235
00:20:18 --> 00:20:24
eventually this one will come back.
It cycles very rapidly in the biota,

236
00:20:24 --> 00:20:29
internal cycling in the ocean.
So, it comes of the river, it's

237
00:20:29 --> 00:20:34
taken up by phytoplankton,
there you can buy zooplankton,

238
00:20:34 --> 00:20:40
and then the phosphorus is excreted
or bacteria [UNINTELLIGIBLE] on dead

239
00:20:40 --> 00:20:49
organisms take up the phosphorous.
It's excreted as organic phosphorous,

240
00:20:49 --> 00:21:02
and it cycles rapidly through
this system.  OK.

241
00:21:02 --> 00:21:15
So the other important feature of
this one way flow, and also

242
00:21:15 --> 00:21:33
humans have altered.

243
00:21:33 --> 00:21:40
In other words,
humans are responsible for this,

244
00:21:40 --> 00:21:47
basically, one-way flow by mining
the phosphorus and putting it into

245
00:21:47 --> 00:21:54
the agricultural system.
OK, yeah, and there's the return

246
00:21:54 --> 00:22:01
flux.
OK, moving on to the nitrogen cycle,

247
00:22:01 --> 00:22:07
which is much more complicated
because it is [redox?

248
00:22:07 --> 00:22:14
chemistry, OK?  And, humans have
also had a major,

249
00:22:14 --> 00:22:20
major, major effect on the global
nitrogen cycle.

250
00:22:20 --> 00:22:27
So, let's first look at the global
estrogen transformation.

251
00:22:27 --> 00:22:31
So this isn't a pools and fluxes
diagram.  This is a summary for you

252
00:22:31 --> 00:22:36
of things you already know.
You already know this.  It just

253
00:22:36 --> 00:22:40
looks different than what you
learned in the second lecture.

254
00:22:40 --> 00:22:45
So let's just go through it very
quickly.  If we think of the

255
00:22:45 --> 00:22:50
compounds of nitrogen as being
either reduced or oxidized and we

256
00:22:50 --> 00:22:54
think of the environment where they
might be found as either being

257
00:22:54 --> 00:22:59
aerobic or oxic,
having oxygen, or anaerobic and oxic,

258
00:22:59 --> 00:23:05
not having oxygen.
We can draw a schematic of these

259
00:23:05 --> 00:23:11
processes that hopefully makes good
sense.  If we start with organic

260
00:23:11 --> 00:23:17
nitrogen, but say it's a dead whale
that you saw is organic nitrogen,

261
00:23:17 --> 00:23:23
bacteria work on it, and through
this process which you haven't

262
00:23:23 --> 00:23:29
really learned about explicitly at,
can convert that to free ammonia.

263
00:23:29 --> 00:23:34
That ammonia can be used in
chemosynthesis,

264
00:23:34 --> 00:23:40
which you learned about.
OK, the specific type of

265
00:23:40 --> 00:23:45
chemosynthesis is called
nitrification,

266
00:23:45 --> 00:23:51
where this ammonia is converted to
nitrite.  Is that an oxidation or a

267
00:23:51 --> 00:23:56
reduction?  Shout it out.
Yes, yes.  It's an oxidation.

268
00:23:56 --> 00:24:02
This was obvious because you can
actually see the oxygen.

269
00:24:02 --> 00:24:06
So, in that, nitrite also in
chemosynthesis can be further

270
00:24:06 --> 00:24:11
oxidized to nitrate.
And chemosynthesis, so this is an

271
00:24:11 --> 00:24:16
energy releasing process for these
bacteria.  Now,

272
00:24:16 --> 00:24:20
so here we now have nitrogen in an
oxidized form,

273
00:24:20 --> 00:24:25
and we are in an anoxic environment,
and that should immediately tell you,

274
00:24:25 --> 00:24:30
oh, that's an electron acceptor for
the anaerobic bacteria which are

275
00:24:30 --> 00:24:35
going to dump their electrons on
this and convert it to NO or N2O.

276
00:24:35 --> 00:24:40
These are gases,
and nitrogen gas.

277
00:24:40 --> 00:24:45
This is denitrification or
anaerobic respiration,

278
00:24:45 --> 00:24:50
which we already talked about.
And it also can be converted

279
00:24:50 --> 00:24:55
through nitrogen fixation,
N2 gas can be converted to ammonia.

280
00:24:55 --> 00:25:00
We already talked about this,
too.

281
00:25:00 --> 00:25:04
Remember, bacteria and cyanobacteria
are the only organisms that can take

282
00:25:04 --> 00:25:09
nitrogen gas from the atmosphere and
converted to ammonia for the use of

283
00:25:09 --> 00:25:13
other organisms.
OK, and then there's one other

284
00:25:13 --> 00:25:18
thing here which is called
assimilatory nitrate reduction.

285
00:25:18 --> 00:25:22
And that is when organisms just
take up nitrate,

286
00:25:22 --> 00:25:27
and inside them, and they reduce it
so that they can,

287
00:25:27 --> 00:25:31
they have to reduce it to ammonia in
order to reduce it for

288
00:25:31 --> 00:25:38
protein synthesis.
So that's another route for nitrate

289
00:25:38 --> 00:25:46
to become organic nitrogen in an
oxidized environment.

290
00:25:46 --> 00:25:54
So these are the important
biological transformations in the

291
00:25:54 --> 00:26:03
cycle.  So, here's the cycle in all
of its complexity.

292
00:26:03 --> 00:26:10
And redox is important.
That's a feature.  I'm going to

293
00:26:10 --> 00:26:18
list these things,
and then we'll look at them on the

294
00:26:18 --> 00:26:25
diagram, has a gaseous phase,
in other words, is an important

295
00:26:25 --> 00:26:33
atmosphere component,
N2, NO, N2O, and by the way,

296
00:26:33 --> 00:26:41
this is a very powerful greenhouse
gas.

297
00:26:41 --> 00:26:52
So, the balance or imbalance in the
nitrogen cycle that results in more

298
00:26:52 --> 00:27:03
or less N2O is very important for
global climate regulation.

299
00:27:03 --> 00:27:29
Nitrogen fixation by microbes and
humans: very important.

300
00:27:29 --> 00:27:37
And denitrification by microbes is
the only way to return nitrogen to

301
00:27:37 --> 00:27:45
the atmosphere.
If you didn't have denitrification,

302
00:27:45 --> 00:27:54
this process that you learned in my
second lecture that you thought was

303
00:27:54 --> 00:28:02
just some weird way things get
through life, is incredibly

304
00:28:02 --> 00:28:11
important in maintaining the global
nitrogen cycle.

305
00:28:11 --> 00:28:18
So, let's look at this,
the details here.  So, in terms of

306
00:28:18 --> 00:28:26
nitrogen fixation,
that's taking N2 gas and converting

307
00:28:26 --> 00:28:33
it to ammonia.
Biological fixation by plants,

308
00:28:33 --> 00:28:39
or it's really not by plants.  It's
by the symbiotic microbes in their

309
00:28:39 --> 00:28:46
roots is 140 times 1012 of grams per
year.  The industrial electrician

310
00:28:46 --> 00:28:52
fixation, that is,
what's done by humans,

311
00:28:52 --> 00:28:59
there's a process called the Haber
process that's incredibly energy

312
00:28:59 --> 00:29:05
intensive.  It takes a lot of fossil
fuel to break that nitrogen

313
00:29:05 --> 00:29:11
triple bond.
In other words,

314
00:29:11 --> 00:29:15
to take nitrogen gas and convert it
to ammonia, you have to break this

315
00:29:15 --> 00:29:19
triple bond which is very energy
intensive.  But they figured that

316
00:29:19 --> 00:29:23
out during World War II basically,
or was it World War I?  Anyway, one

317
00:29:23 --> 00:29:27
of the wars, how to break that bond,
and that was the beginning of the

318
00:29:27 --> 00:29:32
nitrogen fertilizer industry.
So, this is human nitrogen fixation

319
00:29:32 --> 00:29:38
that is used to fertilize crops.
So this is a huge fraction of the

320
00:29:38 --> 00:29:43
natural fixation.
I mean, this adds a huge amount of

321
00:29:43 --> 00:29:49
nitrogen flux to the system.
OK, in this flux here, this is

322
00:29:49 --> 00:29:54
cultivated legume.
So, this would be agricultural bean

323
00:29:54 --> 00:30:00
plants that naturally have nitrogen
fixers in them,

324
00:30:00 --> 00:30:06
and that also import nitrogen into
the system.

325
00:30:06 --> 00:30:12
So, we consider that part of the
human flux.  OK,

326
00:30:12 --> 00:30:18
to balance this, we have
denitrification,

327
00:30:18 --> 00:30:25
which as I said is done by microbes
on land and in the ocean.

328
00:30:25 --> 00:30:31
So, looking at this, is it balanced?
Is nitrogen fixation on a global

329
00:30:31 --> 00:30:37
scale and denitrification balanced?
Did I hear a no?

330
00:30:37 --> 00:30:43
Which is greater?
Denitrification, yeah.

331
00:30:43 --> 00:30:48
If you add this, this, and this,
you get 260.  Is that right?  Yeah,

332
00:30:48 --> 00:30:54
and then you add this, this, and
this you get 310.

333
00:30:54 --> 00:31:00
So, there's more nitrogen going
into the atmosphere than

334
00:31:00 --> 00:31:06
we're taking out.
And people don't understand this.

335
00:31:06 --> 00:31:13
They think the denitrification has
been disproportionately stimulated

336
00:31:13 --> 00:31:19
by this huge flux of nitrogen into
the system.  But this is an

337
00:31:19 --> 00:31:26
important imbalance that a lot of
people are studying very

338
00:31:26 --> 00:31:32
hard.  OK, yeah.
That's the major feature that you

339
00:31:32 --> 00:31:36
want to look at in the system.
And then, if we compare, this

340
00:31:36 --> 00:31:41
figure is from your textbook
comparing the biological nitrogen

341
00:31:41 --> 00:31:45
fixation.  Plus,
lightning fixes it a little bit.

342
00:31:45 --> 00:31:50
Compared to the human, you can see
that humans are now responsible for

343
00:31:50 --> 00:31:54
an equal amount of nitrogen flux on
a global scale as the natural system.

344
00:31:54 --> 00:31:59
This is a dramatic perturbation,
and that's only in the last 50 years

345
00:31:59 --> 00:32:04
or so, dramatic perturbation
to the system.

346
00:32:04 --> 00:32:09
This amount that we are doing is,
140 gigatons is equivalent to 10

347
00:32:09 --> 00:32:15
million trucks of dry nitrogen
fertilizer that we are putting into

348
00:32:15 --> 00:32:20
the system with completely unknown
effects.  OK, the next series of

349
00:32:20 --> 00:32:26
slides are just to illustrate in one
ecosystem the importance of the

350
00:32:26 --> 00:32:32
biota and maintaining nitrogen in
the ecosystem.

351
00:32:32 --> 00:32:35
And I'll also just show you the
importance of experiments in ecology.

352
00:32:35 --> 00:32:39
And this is the Hubbard Brook
Experimental Forest,

353
00:32:39 --> 00:32:43
which is up in New Hampshire.
Some of you might have even visited

354
00:32:43 --> 00:32:47
there.  This was my first job as a
graduate student was actually

355
00:32:47 --> 00:32:50
working in the forest.
I was measuring phosphorous

356
00:32:50 --> 00:32:54
concentrations in the streams.
And what they do there, just like

357
00:32:54 --> 00:32:58
that experimental lake study I
showed you, here,

358
00:32:58 --> 00:33:02
they have permits from the forest
service to clear cut

359
00:33:02 --> 00:33:06
entire watersheds.
A watershed is just an area that

360
00:33:06 --> 00:33:10
collects the rainfall and directs it
into a single stream.

361
00:33:10 --> 00:33:14
You can collect the rain and
measure what's in it,

362
00:33:14 --> 00:33:18
and you can collect the water coming
out and measure what's in it.

363
00:33:18 --> 00:33:22
And the difference is what the
ecosystem is actually doing.

364
00:33:22 --> 00:33:26
So, what they did was they had
these two watersheds that were the

365
00:33:26 --> 00:33:30
same, and they clear cut one of them.
And they asked with the influence

366
00:33:30 --> 00:33:34
of this clear cutting was on the
quality of the water coming

367
00:33:34 --> 00:33:38
out of the system.
And to make a long story very short,

368
00:33:38 --> 00:33:42
it's a really fascinating study
that's been going on for four years

369
00:33:42 --> 00:33:47
that I want to tell you because then
you'll know how old I am.

370
00:33:47 --> 00:33:51
But, here's the control watershed,
and here's the water coming out of

371
00:33:51 --> 00:33:56
the devegetated one,
showing massive [reflux?

372
00:33:56 --> 00:34:01
of nitrate from the system as well
as other cations.

373
00:34:01 --> 00:34:04
And your textbook does a terrible
job of not explaining this.

374
00:34:04 --> 00:34:08
And I don't have time to go into
the details.  But,

375
00:34:08 --> 00:34:12
the major reason this is lost,
the vegetation is really important

376
00:34:12 --> 00:34:16
in that, but it's important in also
maintaining the microbial community

377
00:34:16 --> 00:34:20
in the soil.  And when it's cut down,
the microbial community changes.

378
00:34:20 --> 00:34:24
And that is very important and
resulting in the loss.

379
00:34:24 --> 00:34:28
It's a beautiful study,
which unfortunately we don't have

380
00:34:28 --> 00:34:32
time to go into.
But if you're interested,

381
00:34:32 --> 00:34:36
I can point you in the right
direction.  OK,

382
00:34:36 --> 00:34:40
now, let's go into the really
important, well,

383
00:34:40 --> 00:34:44
they're all important because
they're all coupled.

384
00:34:44 --> 00:34:48
But this is the one that's getting
a lot of attention,

385
00:34:48 --> 00:34:52
the global carbon cycle.
And it's getting a lot of attention

386
00:34:52 --> 00:34:56
because we have had an incredibly
significant impact on it,

387
00:34:56 --> 00:35:01
and we are worried about that
causing major global warming.

388
00:35:01 --> 00:35:05
And as an aside,
I'll just tell you that I actually

389
00:35:05 --> 00:35:10
think the global nitrogen cycle is a
sleeping giant,

390
00:35:10 --> 00:35:14
and that the public doesn't know
much about that right now.

391
00:35:14 --> 00:35:19
But in the scientific community,
we know the perturbation we've had

392
00:35:19 --> 00:35:23
on that cycle could end up being
equally, if not more,

393
00:35:23 --> 00:35:28
traumatic for the Earth's climate as
this.  But that's an aside.

394
00:35:28 --> 00:35:33
So let's focus on this now.
So, here's the global not carbon

395
00:35:33 --> 00:35:38
cycle, which you've seen now several
times in my lectures.

396
00:35:38 --> 00:35:43
So here's gross primary
productivity, and respiration by

397
00:35:43 --> 00:35:48
land plants, respiration by the
soils.  These are RA and RH that we

398
00:35:48 --> 00:35:53
talked about before.
And in this, we have their balance,

399
00:35:53 --> 00:35:58
roughly balanced, and then you have
uptake by the oceans,

400
00:35:58 --> 00:36:03
and loss of CO2 by the oceans.
Your textbook says this is all a

401
00:36:03 --> 00:36:07
physical and chemical process that's
absolutely wrong.

402
00:36:07 --> 00:36:11
The biota are central to that,
and that's another lecture.  But you

403
00:36:11 --> 00:36:15
already know that,
that the phytoplankton are sucking a

404
00:36:15 --> 00:36:20
lot of CO2 in through photosynthesis.
So let's look at the budget here.

405
00:36:20 --> 00:36:24
And, this is the introduction of
CO2 into the atmosphere by burning

406
00:36:24 --> 00:36:28
fossil fuel, and the introduction of
CO2 into the atmosphere by

407
00:36:28 --> 00:36:34
destruction of vegetation.
So, we have 7.

408
00:36:34 --> 00:36:42
gigatons going into the atmosphere
due to human perturbation.

409
00:36:42 --> 00:36:49
The annual increase of CO2 in the
atmosphere is 3.

410
00:36:49 --> 00:36:57
gigatons.  So, 3.
gigatons annual increase,

411
00:36:57 --> 00:37:03
and, let's see.
If we look at the difference here

412
00:37:03 --> 00:37:07
between respiration and
photosynthesis we see that there's 2

413
00:37:07 --> 00:37:11
gigatons going into the vegetation,
actually net into the vegetation.

414
00:37:11 --> 00:37:15
And if we look at this,
we see that there's two going into

415
00:37:15 --> 00:37:19
the ocean.  So,
if we ask, of all of this

416
00:37:19 --> 00:37:23
anthropogenic CO2 where's it going?
3.5 is going to increase in the

417
00:37:23 --> 00:37:27
atmosphere.  Two is going to
vegetation, and two is

418
00:37:27 --> 00:37:33
going to the ocean.
And it's this that we are very

419
00:37:33 --> 00:37:39
concerned about because it's causing
a dramatic increase in the CO2 in

420
00:37:39 --> 00:37:45
the atmosphere.
Even though these are tiny fluxes

421
00:37:45 --> 00:37:51
relative to the global biological
fluxes, these tiny fluxes lead to a

422
00:37:51 --> 00:37:57
significant increase because the
pool is so small of CO2

423
00:37:57 --> 00:38:02
in the atmosphere.
So, this is a trace of CO2 since

424
00:38:02 --> 00:38:06
1960.  Here's a question for you to
think about.  I'm not going to

425
00:38:06 --> 00:38:11
answer it.  Its summer and winter
are out of phase in the Northern and

426
00:38:11 --> 00:38:15
Southern Hemisphere,
why isn't this just smooth?

427
00:38:15 --> 00:38:19
This cycle that we see here is an
annual cycle of the Earth breathing.

428
00:38:19 --> 00:38:24
Remember I showed you that the
first lecture showing photosynthesis

429
00:38:24 --> 00:38:28
greater than respiration during the
summer, and the reverse

430
00:38:28 --> 00:38:33
during the winter.
Think about why it isn't just smooth

431
00:38:33 --> 00:38:38
and canceled out by the two
hemispheres.  OK,

432
00:38:38 --> 00:38:42
and if we look at that same graph,
this is atmospheric CO2 from ice

433
00:38:42 --> 00:38:47
core data as a function of time.
This is today, and this is time

434
00:38:47 --> 00:38:52
before present going backwards.
This is 450,000 years ago.  We can

435
00:38:52 --> 00:38:56
see that CO2 in the atmosphere,
and this is measured in, you take a

436
00:38:56 --> 00:39:01
deep ice core in Greenland,
or something, and you measure the

437
00:39:01 --> 00:39:06
CO2 concentration at different
slices of the core.

438
00:39:06 --> 00:39:11
And it tells you what the Earth was
like back then.

439
00:39:11 --> 00:39:16
And, this just dramatically shows
you what we are doing just that the

440
00:39:16 --> 00:39:21
last hundred years.
We have increased CO2 in the

441
00:39:21 --> 00:39:26
atmosphere dramatically by burning
fossil fuels.  And CO2 is a

442
00:39:26 --> 00:39:31
greenhouse gas,
and so we are very concerned about

443
00:39:31 --> 00:39:36
that.
OK, this is just read showing that

444
00:39:36 --> 00:39:40
slide from last time of upwelling to
remind you that the biogeochemical

445
00:39:40 --> 00:39:45
cycles of these elements are tightly
coupled.  Remember,

446
00:39:45 --> 00:39:49
we talked about nutrients,
nitrogen, phosphorus, being upwelled

447
00:39:49 --> 00:39:54
from the deep water,
phytoplankton taking them up,

448
00:39:54 --> 00:39:58
drawing down CO2 and then we had
oxygen and CO2 going back

449
00:39:58 --> 00:40:03
and forth in the water.
So, the oxygen cycle,

450
00:40:03 --> 00:40:09
which we haven't even talked about
is tightly coupled also to the CO2

451
00:40:09 --> 00:40:14
cycle.  I'm not going to show this
there.  OK, moving on,

452
00:40:14 --> 00:40:19
and I know this is quick,
but this is in your readings.

453
00:40:19 --> 00:40:25
There is a newspaper article about
the Biosphere 2 experiment which now

454
00:40:25 --> 00:40:30
is pretty dated.
To make a long story short,

455
00:40:30 --> 00:40:36
many years ago a very rich person
built the system out in the middle

456
00:40:36 --> 00:40:41
of the Arizona desert.
And it had seven ecosystems in it.

457
00:40:41 --> 00:40:45
It was sealed.  It was closed.  And,
he put people at,

458
00:40:45 --> 00:40:49
which were called biospherians,
and the idea was to see whether

459
00:40:49 --> 00:40:54
humans could create a closed
biosphere that would sustain human

460
00:40:54 --> 00:40:58
life.  And, it was a miserable
failure, which is sad because it

461
00:40:58 --> 00:41:02
costs a lot of money,
and has since been taken over by

462
00:41:02 --> 00:41:07
Columbia University to use it as an
experimental facility.

463
00:41:07 --> 00:41:11
But the one thing that they learned,
here's what happened.  They put the

464
00:41:11 --> 00:41:16
people in.  And it turned out that
there was not enough photosynthesis

465
00:41:16 --> 00:41:21
to supply enough oxygen for the
people to breathe.

466
00:41:21 --> 00:41:25
Oxygen levels steadily went down.
And the reason for that, they

467
00:41:25 --> 00:41:30
learned later,
was that they had put way too much

468
00:41:30 --> 00:41:35
rich soil in the system.
So, the bacteria in the soil were

469
00:41:35 --> 00:41:39
sucking the oxygen out of the
atmosphere.  And there were

470
00:41:39 --> 00:41:44
subsidizing the system with rich
soil so that people would have

471
00:41:44 --> 00:41:49
enough food.  But there was a puzzle,
because if this was the case,

472
00:41:49 --> 00:41:53
because the cycles are coupled,
you should expect to see the same

473
00:41:53 --> 00:41:58
amount of, if this oxygen is coming
from photosynthesis,

474
00:41:58 --> 00:42:03
you should see the same amount of
CO2 coming into the system.

475
00:42:03 --> 00:42:07
And you should see an increase in
CO2 in the atmosphere.

476
00:42:07 --> 00:42:11
And they didn't.  In other words,
they saw oxygen going down, but they

477
00:42:11 --> 00:42:16
didn't see surplus CO2 in the
atmosphere.  And it took a bright

478
00:42:16 --> 00:42:20
graduate student from Columbia
University to go in there and figure

479
00:42:20 --> 00:42:25
out what was going on.
And it turned out that,

480
00:42:25 --> 00:42:29
so why didn't CO2 increase?
It turned out that this CO2,

481
00:42:29 --> 00:42:34
which was coming out of the system
from respiration in the soil was

482
00:42:34 --> 00:42:38
actually binding to the calcium
hydroxide in the cement and making

483
00:42:38 --> 00:42:43
calcium carbonate.
So, the cement,

484
00:42:43 --> 00:42:47
another human invention,
was playing an important role here.

485
00:42:47 --> 00:42:51
The point is that none of this,
this is only understandable in

486
00:42:51 --> 00:42:55
hindsight, because it didn't work.
You can go in and figure out, what

487
00:42:55 --> 00:42:59
the heck, where did these imbalances
come from?  So,

488
00:42:59 --> 00:43:03
it was a very interesting study,
and we learned that it's not easy to

489
00:43:03 --> 00:43:08
mimic natural biosphere
on a very small scale.

490
00:43:08 --> 00:43:12
OK, I'm going to skip that one,
and come to this real quickly,

491
00:43:12 --> 00:43:17
because this was just on the news
this morning as I was driving into

492
00:43:17 --> 00:43:22
work.  I thought,
perfect for this lecture.

493
00:43:22 --> 00:43:27
The UN just announced this
millennium ecosystem assessment.

494
00:43:27 --> 00:43:32
It's on the web.
And 2,000 scientists have been

495
00:43:32 --> 00:43:36
working on this for over ten years
trying to assess the state of the

496
00:43:36 --> 00:43:40
global ecosystems and their
capability to support future

497
00:43:40 --> 00:43:44
generations, i.
. you guys.  And they say the next

498
00:43:44 --> 00:43:49
50 years, and those are the 50 years
that you guys are in charge,

499
00:43:49 --> 00:43:53
are absolutely critical for whether
or not these systems will sustain,

500
00:43:53 --> 00:43:57
be able to sustain human populations.
So you can go to the web if you're

501
00:43:57 --> 00:44:02
interested in that.
OK, quickly to our civil and

502
00:44:02 --> 00:44:06
environmental engineering major,
I'm just going to say that our new

503
00:44:06 --> 00:44:11
motto is nature,
tools, and toys, that nature is

504
00:44:11 --> 00:44:16
ecology.  There is a two series
ecology course.

505
00:44:16 --> 00:44:20
Tools are mechanics: basics,
fundamentals for analyzing systems.

506
00:44:20 --> 00:44:25
And toys is design.  The part of
the curriculum is going to be

507
00:44:25 --> 00:44:30
designing instrumentation for
studying environmental systems.

508
00:44:30 --> 00:44:35
And there are these brochures here
and in the back.

509
00:44:35 --> 00:44:40
So I encourage you to pick those up
if you're at all interested in that

510
00:44:40 --> 00:44:45
major.  Now, let me show you this
cool clip.  Don't leave yet.

511
00:44:45 --> 00:44:51
This is worth it.  It's only two
minutes, and its nature at its best.

512
00:44:51 --> 00:44:56
So, all I need to do here is hit
play.  And this is the soccer

513
00:44:56 --> 00:45:02
player's look like this.
Oh, why didn't that work.

514
00:45:02 --> 00:45:22
[Miophon?] our little

515
00:45:22 --> 00:45:51
bugs in the sand.

516
00:45:51 --> 00:46:08
That's my favorite part.

517
00:46:08 --> 00:46:21
Life is a geological agent.

518
00:46:21 --> 00:46:25
See, that would have been a great
kick off for spring break,

519
00:46:25 --> 00:46:30
but welcome back from spring break.
All right, I'll see you in a few

520
00:46:30 --> 00:46:33
weeks.
