1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
There was a little confusion with
dideoxies in one sense,

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:08
and some of these things like the
PCR you're going to have to sort of

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:12
sit down and actually think about it,
but the principle of the dideoxies,

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:17
if we were making a chain of beads
that had a hook on one end and a

5
00:00:17 --> 00:00:21
little hole on the other,
and we were joining these things

6
00:00:21 --> 00:00:25
together, we could make obviously,
a chain that went on.  And then we

7
00:00:25 --> 00:00:30
could hook another one
in, and so on.

8
00:00:30 --> 00:00:34
And if we had a bunch of beads like
this every now and then we threw in

9
00:00:34 --> 00:00:39
a very small number that didn't have
the hook on the end,

10
00:00:39 --> 00:00:44
any time this particular chain were
elongating and we put on one of

11
00:00:44 --> 00:00:49
these things, the chain would stop
because you haven't got any where to

12
00:00:49 --> 00:00:54
join onto it.  You added dideoxy
into a polymerase reaction.

13
00:00:54 --> 00:00:59
A chain that gets the dideoxy
doesn't have anything to join in the

14
00:00:59 --> 00:01:04
end, and that will stop.
If we only added this,

15
00:01:04 --> 00:01:10
the entire reaction would stop,
and everyone would come at the first

16
00:01:10 --> 00:01:16
time a dideoxy got incorporated.
The trick is to put a little bit in.

17
00:01:16 --> 00:01:21
So, a few of the molecules stop.
Everything keeps going.  The next

18
00:01:21 --> 00:01:27
time a dideoxy gets incorporated,
the chain will stop there.  And out

19
00:01:27 --> 00:01:33
of this, you will generate a family
of polymers that are of

20
00:01:33 --> 00:01:38
different lengths.
Each one will terminate with a

21
00:01:38 --> 00:01:43
dideoxy nucleotide,
and if the dideoxy nucleotide we

22
00:01:43 --> 00:01:49
used in that particular reaction was,
let's say, dideoxy ATP,

23
00:01:49 --> 00:01:54
that means that an A was the last
nucleotide added to every one of

24
00:01:54 --> 00:02:00
those.  And we can separate these on
the basis of size.

25
00:02:00 --> 00:02:04
And if I ran them out on a gel,
I'd see something like that.  And

26
00:02:04 --> 00:02:09
that would tell me that when that
polymerase was coming along,

27
00:02:09 --> 00:02:13
that was the first time it saw an A.
A few stopped there, polymerized a

28
00:02:13 --> 00:02:18
few more.  Then it put in another A,
put in some other things, and so on.

29
00:02:18 --> 00:02:22
And that by itself wouldn't tell us
the sequence.  But if I did that

30
00:02:22 --> 00:02:27
reaction four times in a row,
then I could tell.

31
00:02:27 --> 00:02:31
In the old days,
they didn't used to use dyes.

32
00:02:31 --> 00:02:35
We just did P32 on it as a label,
and then you'd run the four

33
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
reactions side-by-side.
And this would be with dideoxy ATP.

34
00:02:39 --> 00:02:43
You'd see a pattern like that, and
maybe with dideoxy TTP,

35
00:02:43 --> 00:02:47
you'd see something like this.
And when you got the rest of them,

36
00:02:47 --> 00:02:51
you'd kind of end up working out
what the sequence was by looking

37
00:02:51 --> 00:02:55
across the four lanes.
This business of using the dye is

38
00:02:55 --> 00:02:59
just one more step up in the
engineering side that enables the

39
00:02:59 --> 00:03:03
thing to be done automatically.
And it's pretty well explained in

40
00:03:03 --> 00:03:07
your textbooks.
OK, PCR, someone was confused as to

41
00:03:07 --> 00:03:11
why we didn't just let the cell do
it.  Well, the cell does a great job,

42
00:03:11 --> 00:03:16
but if you are a molecular biologist
trying to understand the basis of

43
00:03:16 --> 00:03:20
life or if you're a biological
engineer, and you want to produce

44
00:03:20 --> 00:03:25
something, you need to get hold of a
particular piece of DNA.

45
00:03:25 --> 00:03:29
Or, if you're a forensic
investigator, and you've got a tiny,

46
00:03:29 --> 00:03:33
tiny sample of human DNA, and you
want to know whose it is,

47
00:03:33 --> 00:03:38
you have to make more of it.
And, that's what PCR is all about.

48
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
So I'm going to switch just over to
the net for a minute.

49
00:03:42 --> 00:03:46
I think this first site,
I just want to show you something,

50
00:03:46 --> 00:03:51
how somebody functions in a lab now
with all these genes out there.

51
00:03:51 --> 00:03:55
And then, I'm going to show you a
little animation for PCR that will

52
00:03:55 --> 00:03:59
help.  So, if you just go to Google
and type NCBI,

53
00:03:59 --> 00:04:04
that's the National Center for
Biotechnology Information.

54
00:04:04 --> 00:04:10
And, the Dolan Learning Center is a
center that Cold Spring Harbor

55
00:04:10 --> 00:04:16
Laboratory has set up to teach
people about DNA.

56
00:04:16 --> 00:04:22
So let me just see here.
So, let's just go to, OK,

57
00:04:22 --> 00:04:28
let's use, whoops, this is going to
seize on us.  OK, let's

58
00:04:28 --> 00:04:43
find how it happens.

59
00:04:43 --> 00:04:47
OK, so here's this National Center
for Biotechnology Information.

60
00:04:47 --> 00:04:51
There's all sorts of things you can
search for, and I'm not expecting

61
00:04:51 --> 00:04:55
you to know the site.
I just want to sort of give you a

62
00:04:55 --> 00:04:59
demo.  If I was sitting in my office,
this is the sort of thing I can do

63
00:04:59 --> 00:05:03
easily.  Rather than sequence
looking for DNA sequence,

64
00:05:03 --> 00:05:07
I'm going to look for the translated
sequence of the protein that's

65
00:05:07 --> 00:05:11
encoded by the gene where the
computer's gone through and used the

66
00:05:11 --> 00:05:15
genetic codes tell me the sequence
of a protein.  I told you about

67
00:05:15 --> 00:05:19
sequencing a mismatch repair gene
back in the 80s.

68
00:05:19 --> 00:05:23
It was called MutS,
and I'll put in Walker GC,

69
00:05:23 --> 00:05:27
and probably hopefully get us to the
thing.

70
00:05:27 --> 00:05:31
And there, the very first hit is DNA
repair.  Protein MutS salmonella

71
00:05:31 --> 00:05:36
typhimurium, that's the one I
sequenced.  So I'll just go to that.

72
00:05:36 --> 00:05:41
It has various ways of displaying
the sequence.  I'm going to switch

73
00:05:41 --> 00:05:45
to Fasta, which is a very easy way
to see it.  Now what you see is the

74
00:05:45 --> 00:05:50
sequence of the protein using a one
letter code, or one letter stands

75
00:05:50 --> 00:05:55
for each amino acid.
K is lysine.  A is alanine,

76
00:05:55 --> 00:06:00
and so on.  I'm just going to copy
that, that piece of sequence.

77
00:06:00 --> 00:06:03
OK so that's the bacterial gene for
mismatch repair.

78
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
At the time I put that in the
database, there wasn't anything else

79
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
like it, except for the gene that
was Streptococcus pneumonia.

80
00:06:09 --> 00:06:13
But I found out, someone else is
sequencing by phoning around in the

81
00:06:13 --> 00:06:16
field.  I'm going to go back to the
main site and I'm going to use a

82
00:06:16 --> 00:06:19
program called Blast,
which lets you search the entire

83
00:06:19 --> 00:06:23
database.  I'll use a protein blast.
I'm going to take a protein

84
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
sequence, and I'm going to ask what
else is out there in terms

85
00:06:26 --> 00:06:32
of protein sequences?
I'll paste in this bacterial

86
00:06:32 --> 00:06:40
sequence, and then I'm going to,
if I can, manage this thing.  Let's

87
00:06:40 --> 00:06:49
see if I can get myself down here.
OK, over here I'll probably do, OK,

88
00:06:49 --> 00:06:57
so I'm going to limit it, let's just
search the human genome.

89
00:06:57 --> 00:07:05
That's all we've got to do.
And what did I have to do to get

90
00:07:05 --> 00:07:13
this thing to fit?  Which button?
Go to the right.

91
00:07:13 --> 00:07:19
Can you just come up here for a
second to help me get this set up?

92
00:07:19 --> 00:07:25
I'm computer limited here
apparently.  OK,

93
00:07:25 --> 00:07:31
that one, OK, great,
so why do we not try this again?

94
00:07:31 --> 00:07:51
PAUSE]
Sorry about this.

95
00:07:51 --> 00:08:01
We'll see if we can get this thing
to go.  I have what?

96
00:08:01 --> 00:08:15
Yeah, that's OK though.
That should be fine.  Try again.

97
00:08:15 --> 00:08:30
Let's see if I can get the thing to
work.

98
00:08:30 --> 00:08:35
OK, so it's got it now.
It'll tell me.  It's searching all

99
00:08:35 --> 00:08:40
the sequence that's out there.
There's just an unbelievable amount

100
00:08:40 --> 00:08:45
of sequence.  That's just how long
it took.  It's showing me here a

101
00:08:45 --> 00:08:51
diagrammatic representation of the
things.  Then I can see that the

102
00:08:51 --> 00:08:56
very first it was MutS homolog three
for humans.  And if I go down here,

103
00:08:56 --> 00:09:01
we can actually see on alignment of
the bacterial gene on the top line,

104
00:09:01 --> 00:09:07
and the lines below is the sequence
of that particular human homolog.

105
00:09:07 --> 00:09:10
And you can see in between all the
things that are in common,

106
00:09:10 --> 00:09:13
and particularly down at the
C-terminus of the protein,

107
00:09:13 --> 00:09:17
you can see there's very strong
conservation.  You may not think

108
00:09:17 --> 00:09:20
that that's impressive,
but remember for every one of those

109
00:09:20 --> 00:09:24
positions, there's 20 possibilities.
So, if you get that many in a row,

110
00:09:24 --> 00:09:27
that's the same gene basically.
And when you take the structure,

111
00:09:27 --> 00:09:31
the structure's going to be very,
very similar.

112
00:09:31 --> 00:09:38
And it does mismatch repair in both.
Just to try and give you an idea of

113
00:09:38 --> 00:09:45
how you do sequence now,
because with all these genomes done,

114
00:09:45 --> 00:09:52
you do the vast majority of it by
computer, rather than some other way.

115
00:09:52 --> 00:09:59
I want to take you and show you
this.  DNA learning: if you go there,

116
00:09:59 --> 00:10:06
the second thing is a
set of animations.

117
00:10:06 --> 00:10:11
Go to the animations.
There's one on polymerase chain

118
00:10:11 --> 00:10:16
reaction.  And,
I'm going to just show you this

119
00:10:16 --> 00:10:21
because this is a nice little,
let's see if we can get this thing

120
00:10:21 --> 00:10:26
to center.  OK we'll have to see
whether this is going to work.

121
00:10:26 --> 00:10:31
OK, so this is the principle of,
you can go do this at your leisure,

122
00:10:31 --> 00:10:37
but the idea is to heat the DNA up,
the strands come apart.

123
00:10:37 --> 00:10:40
Then, were going to take these two
little primers,

124
00:10:40 --> 00:10:43
not promoters, which I think someone
was confused about,

125
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
a little piece of DNA that
complimentary,

126
00:10:46 --> 00:10:50
and anneal them.
Than we added DNA polymerase.

127
00:10:50 --> 00:10:53
You know what happens then.  We
extend those primers.

128
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
That was the first cycle.
Do the same thing again.  Go to the

129
00:10:56 --> 00:11:00
second cycle.  This is what I was
drawing on the board the other day.

130
00:11:00 --> 00:11:06
Now are going to denature the DNA.
The strands come apart.  Let's let

131
00:11:06 --> 00:11:13
the polymerase extend them.
Let's go to the third cycle,

132
00:11:13 --> 00:11:19
denature the DNA, anneal the primers,
extend the primers,

133
00:11:19 --> 00:11:26
and now for the first time,
we've got what we were shooting for.

134
00:11:26 --> 00:11:35
We have a double-stranded copy of

135
00:11:35 --> 00:11:45
just the DNA that was defined
between those primers.

136
00:11:45 --> 00:11:55
OK, I think this actually,
I'm going to go back one.  Oops,

137
00:11:55 --> 00:12:02
OK.
If you go, then,

138
00:12:02 --> 00:12:06
to the amplification graph,
what they're doing here is they're

139
00:12:06 --> 00:12:11
showing you what happens as you do
successive cycles.

140
00:12:11 --> 00:12:16
So, at the first, oh,
it's down here.  Just a minute.

141
00:12:16 --> 00:12:20
If we do the first cycle, we end up
with two DNA copies.

142
00:12:20 --> 00:12:25
That's just plotting what I showed
you.  The next one: we have four.

143
00:12:25 --> 00:12:30
We haven't yet got to this target
sequence.

144
00:12:30 --> 00:12:36
By the next cycle,
we now have two copies of the target

145
00:12:36 --> 00:12:43
sequence plus these other things.
But if you keep going, let's say by

146
00:12:43 --> 00:12:50
the time we're at seven cycles,
the number of targets is up to 114.

147
00:12:50 --> 00:12:56
The number of DNA copies is 128.
But, if we keep going like this,

148
00:12:56 --> 00:13:03
we'll find out that the target
copies become the vast majority of

149
00:13:03 --> 00:13:09
the sequences that are in there.
So, by the time that you're up in

150
00:13:09 --> 00:13:13
the 30 cycles,
or something like that,

151
00:13:13 --> 00:13:18
there's only a handful of the
original things,

152
00:13:18 --> 00:13:22
or almost all, and that,
I hope will help some of you who

153
00:13:22 --> 00:13:27
might have had problems with
understanding the PCR.

154
00:13:27 --> 00:13:32
So, what I'm going to do is tell you
a few more things about what you can

155
00:13:32 --> 00:13:37
do with recombinant DNA,
this recombinant DNA technology,

156
00:13:37 --> 00:13:42
because it's just so powerful.  And
I can only sort of give you a few

157
00:13:42 --> 00:13:47
ideas, and show you a few variations.
But, most of these things are just

158
00:13:47 --> 00:13:53
taking principles that you've
already learned as part of the basic

159
00:13:53 --> 00:13:58
biology I'm trying to tell you,
and then using them like an engineer

160
00:13:58 --> 00:14:03
to achieve some applied purpose.
For example suppose I wanted to

161
00:14:03 --> 00:14:07
produce a human protein,
and try and produce it in a

162
00:14:07 --> 00:14:11
bacterium.  That would be great.
I could take the one gene.  I could

163
00:14:11 --> 00:14:15
grow a fermenter load of E.
coli, and if I got it right,

164
00:14:15 --> 00:14:19
then I'd be able to make a lot of
this protein instead of trying to

165
00:14:19 --> 00:14:23
isolate it from some human source or
something like that.

166
00:14:23 --> 00:14:27
There's a couple of problems.
We talked about them.  One is the

167
00:14:27 --> 00:14:32
problem of promoters.
Another one is that human DNA would

168
00:14:32 --> 00:14:36
have introns in it.
And, bacteria doesn't recognize the

169
00:14:36 --> 00:14:41
human promoters.
It wouldn't start to make an RNA in

170
00:14:41 --> 00:14:46
the right place,
and it doesn't know what to do about

171
00:14:46 --> 00:14:50
splicing out the intron.
So, let's address the intron first.

172
00:14:50 --> 00:14:55
There is a way of handling that
that's quite easy.

173
00:14:55 --> 00:15:00
And that's what's called to make
cDNA library.

174
00:15:00 --> 00:15:08
So, if we have DNA,
and then we get the RNA,

175
00:15:08 --> 00:15:17
we get the RNA copy [SOUND OFF/THEN
ON] including these intron sequences.

176
00:15:17 --> 00:15:25
And then what happens,
this is RNA splicing that we talked

177
00:15:25 --> 00:15:34
about.  And what we get out of that
would be an mRNA,

178
00:15:34 --> 00:15:43
in which the introns have been
removed.

179
00:15:43 --> 00:15:47
So, eukaryotic cells,
my cells, know how to express the

180
00:15:47 --> 00:15:51
gene, so they make the RNA,
they know how to get rid of the

181
00:15:51 --> 00:15:55
introns.  So, if I were to isolate a
messenger RNA.

182
00:15:55 --> 00:15:59
That's been spliced from me,
or you, or anything, what we would

183
00:15:59 --> 00:16:03
have is a population of RNA
molecules that don't have

184
00:16:03 --> 00:16:10
introns anymore.
Anybody remember any way we could

185
00:16:10 --> 00:16:19
get from RNA back to DNA?
Reverse transcriptase.  So,

186
00:16:19 --> 00:16:28
if we used reverse transcriptase,
that protein that David Baltimore

187
00:16:28 --> 00:16:37
discovered and viruses,
and which retroviruses use,

188
00:16:37 --> 00:16:46
now we would have a signle stranded
DNA copy of the mRNA.

189
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
And then, we could use an ordinary
DNA polymerase to get ourselves to

190
00:16:49 --> 00:16:53
double-stranded DNA.
We'd be doing, in essence,

191
00:16:53 --> 00:16:57
exactly what one of these
retroviruses does.

192
00:16:57 --> 00:17:03
This would give us what's known as a
cDNA library, where the genes don't

193
00:17:03 --> 00:17:09
have introns anymore.
So, if I wanted to get at one of my

194
00:17:09 --> 00:17:15
proteins, one of my genes,
and think about expressing it in E.

195
00:17:15 --> 00:17:21
coli, what I would do is go looking
in a cDNA library using a sort of

196
00:17:21 --> 00:17:27
approach as we've done,
trying to find my gene of interest,

197
00:17:27 --> 00:17:33
because if I use the cDNA library
now it would just be like

198
00:17:33 --> 00:17:37
a bacterial gene.
You could see the ATG start.

199
00:17:37 --> 00:17:41
You could get out your handy little
genetic code, and you could walk

200
00:17:41 --> 00:17:44
along, and read out the sequence of
the protein.  So,

201
00:17:44 --> 00:17:48
that's part of what you need to do
if you wanted to make,

202
00:17:48 --> 00:17:52
say, a protein inside of a bacterium.
The other one which we talked about

203
00:17:52 --> 00:17:55
was since the promoters are not a
universal language,

204
00:17:55 --> 00:17:59
what E. coli RNA polymerase sees is
different than what human RNA

205
00:17:59 --> 00:18:04
polymerase sees as a start site.
I would have to add in a promoter

206
00:18:04 --> 00:18:10
that would drive the expression of
this open reading frame if I wanted

207
00:18:10 --> 00:18:17
it to work in E.
coli.  And that's fairly easily done,

208
00:18:17 --> 00:18:23
too.  A general thing that's for
this is called expression cloning.

209
00:18:23 --> 00:18:30
And it would be more or less the
same idea.

210
00:18:30 --> 00:18:34
We'd have a vector that had a
cloning site.  It has an origin of

211
00:18:34 --> 00:18:39
replication, and maybe there's a
selectable marker such as the drug

212
00:18:39 --> 00:18:44
resistance.  That's the basic kind
of factor that I talked about before.

213
00:18:44 --> 00:18:49
However, if I clone in a piece of
DNA into that,

214
00:18:49 --> 00:18:54
it has to have a promoter that can
be read in the organism working with,

215
00:18:54 --> 00:18:59
because it's just out whatever
nature gave it,

216
00:18:59 --> 00:19:04
whatever promoter that would be in
front of that.

217
00:19:04 --> 00:19:09
But, if I were to now into this
vector put an E.

218
00:19:09 --> 00:19:15
coli promoter right there,
now, if I just downstream of that

219
00:19:15 --> 00:19:21
put any open reading frame,
human protein lets say, which we've

220
00:19:21 --> 00:19:27
gotten rid of the introns,
the human genes minus its introns,

221
00:19:27 --> 00:19:33
which you got from the cDNA library,
now when the bacterial polymerase

222
00:19:33 --> 00:19:39
came along, it would be copying,
making it a messenger RNA for human

223
00:19:39 --> 00:19:45
protein, and we could
get it out of that.

224
00:19:45 --> 00:19:51
And the beauty of that,
suppose we took the front part of

225
00:19:51 --> 00:19:57
the Lac operator,
we would have a regulated promoter.

226
00:19:57 --> 00:20:03
It would be just everything we
studied about Lac if we

227
00:20:03 --> 00:20:08
were to starve it for,
you know, we have to get rid of

228
00:20:08 --> 00:20:12
glucose, and then if we added
lactose or some kind of synthetic

229
00:20:12 --> 00:20:16
inducer, we can turn the promoter on
and off.  So, you could grow an

230
00:20:16 --> 00:20:20
entire fermenter load of bacteria
without expressing the gene.

231
00:20:20 --> 00:20:24
And then, once you had the bacteria
all grown up, you could throw in

232
00:20:24 --> 00:20:28
something that would normally induce
the expression of the Lac

233
00:20:28 --> 00:20:32
regulatory system.
And now, instead of making beta

234
00:20:32 --> 00:20:36
galactosidase,
instead it would make the protein

235
00:20:36 --> 00:20:40
that you are interested in,
you with me?  It's very pretty.

236
00:20:40 --> 00:20:44
And in fact, so much of what you
can see in this is,

237
00:20:44 --> 00:20:47
these really basic studies,
since the Lac system was one of the

238
00:20:47 --> 00:20:51
first to really be worked out in
detail, we use its parts.

239
00:20:51 --> 00:20:55
And, there are many vectors around
now that have exactly that.

240
00:20:55 --> 00:20:59
They have the Lac promoter,
and you can turn things on and off

241
00:20:59 --> 00:21:04
in a regulated way,
so not only provide a promoter that

242
00:21:04 --> 00:21:11
works in the organism,
but it also gives you a measure of

243
00:21:11 --> 00:21:19
control.  There's another very cute
trick, and what we've done sort of

244
00:21:19 --> 00:21:26
here is we took,
say, the promoter for Lac in the

245
00:21:26 --> 00:21:32
regulatory region.
I'll use R to stand for regulatory

246
00:21:32 --> 00:21:37
region, and then this would be the
LacZ sequence.

247
00:21:37 --> 00:21:41
What we've really done,
is we've taken a gene from somewhere

248
00:21:41 --> 00:21:46
else, let's call it gene X that had
a promoter from gene X.

249
00:21:46 --> 00:21:51
And, in essence, is cutting each of
them here.  And,

250
00:21:51 --> 00:21:56
now we take the regulatory promoter
region from Lac and we put down

251
00:21:56 --> 00:22:00
below it gene X.
And, now we've got this gene whose

252
00:22:00 --> 00:22:05
products we're interested in
producing in a fermenter under the

253
00:22:05 --> 00:22:10
control of the Lac operon.
Well, there's another kind of thing

254
00:22:10 --> 00:22:16
we can do.  We can do the other way
around.  We could take LacZ,

255
00:22:16 --> 00:22:21
which makes beta galactosidase.
We could put it under the promoter

256
00:22:21 --> 00:22:26
regulatory region of gene X.
Well, what will happen then?

257
00:22:26 --> 00:22:32
If that construct is sitting in a
cell, anytime that the cell decides

258
00:22:32 --> 00:22:37
to make gene X,
instead it will make beta

259
00:22:37 --> 00:22:43
galactosidase, which is really
easy to assay for.

260
00:22:43 --> 00:22:51
And, this sort of strategy,
you'd use something like LacZ as a

261
00:22:51 --> 00:23:00
reporter.
In this case beta galactosidase

262
00:23:00 --> 00:23:11
synthesis, which you can assay for,
reports when is the promoter of gene

263
00:23:11 --> 00:23:23
X is functioning.
This reporter gene now has the

264
00:23:23 --> 00:23:34
regulatory characteristics that are
imposed upon it by that

265
00:23:34 --> 00:23:42
particular promoter.
So, there's this picture that I've

266
00:23:42 --> 00:23:46
showed you, this little movie I
showed you early on.

267
00:23:46 --> 00:23:50
You've seen it a couple of times.
In this case, the reporter is green

268
00:23:50 --> 00:23:55
fluorescent protein.
What Barbara Meyer, who made this

269
00:23:55 --> 00:23:59
particular construct,
did was they took the gene for green

270
00:23:59 --> 00:24:04
florescent protein which started out
in a jellyfish as you may remember.

271
00:24:04 --> 00:24:09
And, the protein folds up,
and ends up being fluorescent.

272
00:24:09 --> 00:24:15
So, we can tell when it's expressed
very easily.  And in this case,

273
00:24:15 --> 00:24:21
you'll notice not all of the genes
in the whole worm isn't glowing.

274
00:24:21 --> 00:24:27
And so, it's under the control of
the promoter regulatory region that

275
00:24:27 --> 00:24:33
is expressed only in specific
body parts.

276
00:24:33 --> 00:24:36
And so, you can see where that
promoter is working by just looking

277
00:24:36 --> 00:24:39
at the worm.  In the case of
something like the mouse that we

278
00:24:39 --> 00:24:43
talked about, it's a pretty uniform
expression at least in the skin.

279
00:24:43 --> 00:24:46
So, that was probably, in that case,
the green fluorescent protein was

280
00:24:46 --> 00:24:50
probably put in a promoter that's
expressed in probably most of the

281
00:24:50 --> 00:24:53
cells in the body,
at least certainly all the ones in

282
00:24:53 --> 00:24:57
the mouse cell.
I don't know the details of that.

283
00:24:57 --> 00:25:01
Ditto over here.
It was probably something that was

284
00:25:01 --> 00:25:07
expressed in most of the body cells,
but you also could have put

285
00:25:07 --> 00:25:12
something that was just expressed in
some very little bits.

286
00:25:12 --> 00:25:18
So, depending on how you do the
construct, there are a lot of

287
00:25:18 --> 00:25:24
different things that people can do
in this sort of thing.

288
00:25:24 --> 00:25:29
OK, one more category that comes
out of the sort of thing,

289
00:25:29 --> 00:25:35
is if we have a gene of some type,
I don't know what it does but I'd

290
00:25:35 --> 00:25:40
like to find out.
You know, at least budding

291
00:25:40 --> 00:25:44
geneticists, know what we'd like to
do.  We'd probably just like to

292
00:25:44 --> 00:25:48
disable that gene very specifically,
and then look at the live organism

293
00:25:48 --> 00:25:53
to see what happens.
And, the principle is the same

294
00:25:53 --> 00:25:57
whether you're doing it in E.
coli or a mouse.  It gets a little

295
00:25:57 --> 00:26:02
more complicated for technical
reasons doing it in a mouse.

296
00:26:02 --> 00:26:06
But the idea is exactly the same.
And here's the strategy.  So, we'll

297
00:26:06 --> 00:26:11
just take a piece of DNA from the
organism.  And sitting at here is

298
00:26:11 --> 00:26:15
this open reading frame that we've
seen.  We don't know what its

299
00:26:15 --> 00:26:20
function is.  We think if I could
knock it out, get rid of its

300
00:26:20 --> 00:26:24
function, I'll look at the organism.
Maybe I can make a guess then.  So,

301
00:26:24 --> 00:26:29
if we were to cut the gene somewhere
with a restriction site,

302
00:26:29 --> 00:26:33
and then we were to take,
for example, a gene encoding a drug

303
00:26:33 --> 00:26:38
resistance or something like that,
and insert it at that point, what we

304
00:26:38 --> 00:26:43
would end up with is this piece of
the organism's DNA.

305
00:26:43 --> 00:26:51
The first part of gene X,
then a drug resistance, then the

306
00:26:51 --> 00:26:59
last part of gene X,
and some more sequence from the

307
00:26:59 --> 00:27:06
organism.
Now, this would be,

308
00:27:06 --> 00:27:11
we'd have this in a test tube.
We could do it by the kind of

309
00:27:11 --> 00:27:16
recombinant DNA manipulations that
we have.  And what would happen if I

310
00:27:16 --> 00:27:21
were to put, now,
let's keep it with bacteria where

311
00:27:21 --> 00:27:26
it's easy to see.
If I were to take that piece of DNA,

312
00:27:26 --> 00:27:31
put it inside a living cell,
what's going to happen?

313
00:27:31 --> 00:27:38
Well, let's make this,
say, here's the end of it.

314
00:27:38 --> 00:27:45
That's all we've got.  Well,
inside the living cell, we of course

315
00:27:45 --> 00:27:52
have the entire genome.
And then we come to this part.

316
00:27:52 --> 00:28:00
We have gene X.  Then we'd have
this going.

317
00:28:00 --> 00:28:04
That would be the whole thing.
Well, this particular piece doesn't

318
00:28:04 --> 00:28:09
have an origin of replication.
It's not joined to a vector.  It's

319
00:28:09 --> 00:28:13
just sitting there.
So, if the cell divides,

320
00:28:13 --> 00:28:18
it's not going to get replicated.
So, if I select for a drug

321
00:28:18 --> 00:28:22
resistance that's on that piece of
DNA, unless something happens I'm

322
00:28:22 --> 00:28:27
not going to get a drug-resistant
bacteria.  But you do know a way

323
00:28:27 --> 00:28:32
that this thing could join to an
origin of replication.

324
00:28:32 --> 00:28:36
It could join to the origin of
replication that's on the bacteria

325
00:28:36 --> 00:28:41
chromosome.  And,
the way to do it would be by

326
00:28:41 --> 00:28:46
undergoing genetic recombination
over here, because this DNA is

327
00:28:46 --> 00:28:51
exactly the same as on that side,
and over here it's the same thing.

328
00:28:51 --> 00:28:56
This DNA is the same as that side.
So, if that genetic exchange

329
00:28:56 --> 00:29:01
happened, what would happen,
even if it happened rarely, was this

330
00:29:01 --> 00:29:06
piece of DNA would replace the piece
of DNA that's in there.

331
00:29:06 --> 00:29:10
I'd be able to tell it was there
because I'd just select for drug

332
00:29:10 --> 00:29:14
resistance.  And even if it only
happened only one in 500,

333
00:29:14 --> 00:29:18
00 cells, it wouldn't matter because
up would growth the colony that now

334
00:29:18 --> 00:29:22
has the drug in the middle of gene X.
Gene X is gone,

335
00:29:22 --> 00:29:26
and I could look at the organism if
it's alive and see if

336
00:29:26 --> 00:29:31
it has a phenotype.
If it's an essential gene,

337
00:29:31 --> 00:29:35
that strategy obviously won't work,
and when people do the more

338
00:29:35 --> 00:29:40
complicated thing of doing this kind
of experiment to make a transgenic

339
00:29:40 --> 00:29:44
mouse, it takes about a year to go
from our DNA manipulation all the

340
00:29:44 --> 00:29:49
way to the live mouse with a
disrupted gene.

341
00:29:49 --> 00:29:53
And sometimes what they find after
spending half of your PhD.

342
00:29:53 --> 00:29:58
is that that was an essential gene.
And, there's no live mouse, or it

343
00:29:58 --> 00:30:03
made it two days into being an
embryo and it tanked at that point.

344
00:30:03 --> 00:30:07
But, this again,
you could see, we talked about going

345
00:30:07 --> 00:30:11
back and forth between gene,
protein, and trying to figure out

346
00:30:11 --> 00:30:15
function.  All I can sort of do is
give you the flavor of what's going

347
00:30:15 --> 00:30:19
on.  But one sort of overarching
thing I hope you remember going

348
00:30:19 --> 00:30:23
through this is DNA sequencing,
PCR, all these kinds of

349
00:30:23 --> 00:30:27
manipulations we're talking about
are just exploiting these basic

350
00:30:27 --> 00:30:31
cellular components that we learned
about studying, how does

351
00:30:31 --> 00:30:36
DNA replicate?
How is information coded?

352
00:30:36 --> 00:30:40
How do genes get expressed?
How does genetic information gets

353
00:30:40 --> 00:30:45
sorted between cells?
It's simply applying those

354
00:30:45 --> 00:30:50
relatively well understood tools,
or sort of biological principles and

355
00:30:50 --> 00:30:54
parts that we learned about,
and now using them as tools in an

356
00:30:54 --> 00:30:59
engineering way,
and have just completely transformed

357
00:30:59 --> 00:31:04
the way biology has been done in the
last couple decades.

358
00:31:04 --> 00:31:11
And it's just,
as I say, things are changing so,

359
00:31:11 --> 00:31:18
so fast.  It's almost breathtaking.
So, the last little bit of sort of

360
00:31:18 --> 00:31:25
technique oriented stuff,
I just want to at least make sure

361
00:31:25 --> 00:31:32
I've mentioned what are called
microarrays.  You often hear these

362
00:31:32 --> 00:31:38
referred to as DNA chips.
The principle here is this is a way

363
00:31:38 --> 00:31:42
that lets you ask,
not only whether one gene is being

364
00:31:42 --> 00:31:46
expressed or not under a particular
condition, whether its RNA is being

365
00:31:46 --> 00:31:50
made, and in most cases that means
making protein,

366
00:31:50 --> 00:31:54
or whether it's off,
or whether it's at some intermediate

367
00:31:54 --> 00:31:58
level.  A microarray lets you do
that experiment with many,

368
00:31:58 --> 00:32:02
many, many genes at once.  And
here's the principle.

369
00:32:02 --> 00:32:11
You take some surface,
and there will be a bunch of,

370
00:32:11 --> 00:32:20
if you will, sites on the surface,
on this chip or whatever.  And, what

371
00:32:20 --> 00:32:30
will go to be attached here would be
a little piece of DNA

372
00:32:30 --> 00:32:39
from gene one.
I mean, let's say,

373
00:32:39 --> 00:32:47
maybe a hundred nucleotides: that
would be far more than enough to

374
00:32:47 --> 00:32:55
make it absolutely specific that
they could only hybridize to a

375
00:32:55 --> 00:33:03
messenger RNA from gene one,
and not from anything else.  And,

376
00:33:03 --> 00:33:11
this one, then, would have from gene
two, this one, from gene

377
00:33:11 --> 00:33:22
three, and so on.
Then, if we were to take a messenger

378
00:33:22 --> 00:33:32
RNA preparation from,
say, an organism if it's a little

379
00:33:32 --> 00:33:37
one, or maybe a tissue,
or something like that, anywhere you

380
00:33:37 --> 00:33:41
could isolate RNA from.
And then, we'll label it in some

381
00:33:41 --> 00:33:46
kind of way, and we can label it
radioactivity,

382
00:33:46 --> 00:33:51
we can label it with dyes.
It's usually done with dyes,

383
00:33:51 --> 00:33:55
and there are a variety of
variations on this.

384
00:33:55 --> 00:34:00
Those are sort of technical details
how to do it.  But here's

385
00:34:00 --> 00:34:05
the principle.
Let's just, for the moment,

386
00:34:05 --> 00:34:11
just consider that it's got a label
on it.  So if we take the messenger

387
00:34:11 --> 00:34:17
RNA, and take this little chip that
has samples in the extreme,

388
00:34:17 --> 00:34:22
it could be a sample of every single
gene that's in the genome of that

389
00:34:22 --> 00:34:28
organism, we take this labeled RNA,
actually what we would usually do is

390
00:34:28 --> 00:34:34
to use this to make a labeled cDNA
preparation, which would be a copy

391
00:34:34 --> 00:34:39
of each one of these things.
That the technically easy way to get

392
00:34:39 --> 00:34:43
label into it.
But what we do have is if the gene

393
00:34:43 --> 00:34:47
was on, its messenger RNA would be
on, and we'd have a bunch of stuff

394
00:34:47 --> 00:34:52
corresponding to gene one that had
label on it.  And if we give it a

395
00:34:52 --> 00:34:56
chance, that will,
then, hybridize here.

396
00:34:56 --> 00:35:01
And there would be some way of
detecting this label.

397
00:35:01 --> 00:35:05
If gene two was off in that sample,
there won't be any hybridization.

398
00:35:05 --> 00:35:10
There won't be any signal.
You can sort of see in principle

399
00:35:10 --> 00:35:14
what you're doing is you're
interrogating each gene in the

400
00:35:14 --> 00:35:19
extreme, each gene in the organism
under some condition.

401
00:35:19 --> 00:35:23
Is it on?  Is it off?
If you did various samples,

402
00:35:23 --> 00:35:28
and you could see maybe it's in an
intermediate level, and so on.

403
00:35:28 --> 00:35:32
So, the chips look like that,
50-100,000 genes perhaps, something

404
00:35:32 --> 00:35:37
like that.  These things are really
small.  Here's sort of a display of

405
00:35:37 --> 00:35:41
a simple one, and this is one where
they're taking RNA.

406
00:35:41 --> 00:35:46
The samples are from two conditions.
One's labeled with a dye that's

407
00:35:46 --> 00:35:50
green, and one's labeled with a dye
that's red.  And,

408
00:35:50 --> 00:35:55
if you get equal amounts,
it looks yellow.  So, they mix the

409
00:35:55 --> 00:35:59
two things together,
and if the gene is the same under

410
00:35:59 --> 00:36:04
two conditions it would be yellow.
Under one condition,

411
00:36:04 --> 00:36:08
if the gene was on in condition one
than it would be green,

412
00:36:08 --> 00:36:12
and off in two, and back and forth.
So, without trying to get lost in

413
00:36:12 --> 00:36:16
the technical details right now,
which doesn't matter, the principle

414
00:36:16 --> 00:36:20
of this thing is that you can take,
you can sort of, by making a

415
00:36:20 --> 00:36:24
preparation of RNA,
then you can use these DNA chips and

416
00:36:24 --> 00:36:28
say, is each gene on and off?
Or if I switch conditions, who

417
00:36:28 --> 00:36:31
comes on and off?
So, it's a little like,

418
00:36:31 --> 00:36:35
I think of it this way.  It's like
having, all right,

419
00:36:35 --> 00:36:39
who's on today?  And a number of
hands go up, or something.

420
00:36:39 --> 00:36:43
And the rest of you would be off.
But, come back on Monday, and I say

421
00:36:43 --> 00:36:46
to the something or other,
and a different set of you would put

422
00:36:46 --> 00:36:50
up hands.  And what I'm kind of
looking at are the changes between

423
00:36:50 --> 00:36:54
that.  And the sort of thing where
this has been so powerful,

424
00:36:54 --> 00:36:58
for example, is there are kind of
cancers for which there is a

425
00:36:58 --> 00:37:02
treatment, but it was
only 20% successful.

426
00:37:02 --> 00:37:07
And, when people started to study
these cancers and then looked to see

427
00:37:07 --> 00:37:12
what genes were on,
what they realized was even though

428
00:37:12 --> 00:37:17
physicians had given these cancers a
particular name,

429
00:37:17 --> 00:37:22
if you looked at which genes were
being expressed,

430
00:37:22 --> 00:37:27
they fell into two classes,
class A and class B.

431
00:37:27 --> 00:37:35
And what they then realized was that
the treatment they were using was

432
00:37:35 --> 00:37:43
100% effective of tumors of class A,
and wasn't doing anything for the

433
00:37:43 --> 00:37:51
tumors of class B.
The physician couldn't tell the

434
00:37:51 --> 00:38:00
difference between these two types
of tumors, but a microarray can

435
00:38:00 --> 00:38:05
So, again we have so little time in
this class.  I could go on basically

436
00:38:05 --> 00:38:11
for ages.  There's the output of the
real sort of DNA chip.

437
00:38:11 --> 00:38:17
You can see things are very dense,
and the great cleverness in doing

438
00:38:17 --> 00:38:23
these things, people now use the
technology that goes with LaserJet

439
00:38:23 --> 00:38:29
printers to actually synthesize
little pieces of either DNA or

440
00:38:29 --> 00:38:35
proteins starting on a little spot
on each membrane, or on

441
00:38:35 --> 00:38:39
the chip, or whatever.
You put it on one nucleotide and

442
00:38:39 --> 00:38:43
then you put it on the next,
and the next, and the next.  You

443
00:38:43 --> 00:38:47
could sequence it using technology
that's already around for inkjet

444
00:38:47 --> 00:38:51
printers at that kind of thing.
So here you've seen a fusion of

445
00:38:51 --> 00:38:55
different types of engineering.
OK, the last thing I'm going to

446
00:38:55 --> 00:38:59
tell you about is a little bit about
the immune system.

447
00:38:59 --> 00:39:03
We've run into this.
This is a movie that some of you

448
00:39:03 --> 00:39:08
liked, got the biggest aw I think of
the last part of the course anyway.

449
00:39:08 --> 00:39:13
But what we are seeing here is a
white blood cell pushing aside from

450
00:39:13 --> 00:39:18
red blood cells,
which are stationary,

451
00:39:18 --> 00:39:22
and chasing a bacterium.
It's obvious that it can trace it.

452
00:39:22 --> 00:39:27
It's able to recognize some things,
and at some point, then, it took it

453
00:39:27 --> 00:39:32
up.  The principle of what happened
there was this white blood cell had

454
00:39:32 --> 00:39:37
a capacity to recognize the bacteria,
then bind to it.

455
00:39:37 --> 00:39:43
And then, its membrane,
this is the membrane, and this is a

456
00:39:43 --> 00:39:50
white blood cell.
There's many types of these,

457
00:39:50 --> 00:39:56
and it pinches the membrane off.
So you have the bacterium.  This is

458
00:39:56 --> 00:40:02
the bacterium.
And, it's inside a little membrane

459
00:40:02 --> 00:40:06
compartment, as if the bacteria is
in a little soap bubble.

460
00:40:06 --> 00:40:11
And the principle of what happens
is the white blood cell has another

461
00:40:11 --> 00:40:15
soap bubble that's full of poison.
And, if you took two soap bubbles

462
00:40:15 --> 00:40:19
and push them together,
you know what happens.  They'll fuse,

463
00:40:19 --> 00:40:24
and you'll get a bigger soap bubble.
And that's, in essence, how these

464
00:40:24 --> 00:40:28
white blood cells normally kill
bacteria.  They would bring together

465
00:40:28 --> 00:40:33
these two compartments.
Now you have a bacteria and a poison

466
00:40:33 --> 00:40:38
within a white blood cell at the
bacterium, would get killed.

467
00:40:38 --> 00:40:43
And we talked about how bacteria
fought back.  That was a

468
00:40:43 --> 00:40:48
streptococcus that has a capsule.
And the capsule, by having

469
00:40:48 --> 00:40:53
polysaccharide on the outside,
prevent the white blood cell from

470
00:40:53 --> 00:40:58
being able to grab hold of some
feature of the bacteria,

471
00:40:58 --> 00:41:04
that starts this process of killing
it.

472
00:41:04 --> 00:41:08
And when I told you the story of how
DNA was found,

473
00:41:08 --> 00:41:12
it was people studying pneumonia.
If you remember, it was

474
00:41:12 --> 00:41:17
streptococcus.
If the streptococcus had a capsule,

475
00:41:17 --> 00:41:21
and the people would get very sick.
And after five or six days,

476
00:41:21 --> 00:41:26
there would be a crisis where they
either lived, or they died.

477
00:41:26 --> 00:41:30
And what would happen in that time
is that, the last thing I'll tell

478
00:41:30 --> 00:41:35
you about, what's called the
adaptive immune system would have

479
00:41:35 --> 00:41:39
generated special recognition
molecules called antibodies that

480
00:41:39 --> 00:41:44
would have learns to recognize the
capsule at that bacterium.

481
00:41:44 --> 00:41:49
And once those were there,
now those white blood cells would be

482
00:41:49 --> 00:41:54
able to capture the bacterium,
because the antibodies give it a

483
00:41:54 --> 00:41:59
hand in recognizing there was
something there that needed

484
00:41:59 --> 00:42:04
to be killed.
The way this adaptive immune system

485
00:42:04 --> 00:42:09
works, it's almost like science
fiction.  And I'll tell you the

486
00:42:09 --> 00:42:14
molecular basis of it.
The key insight came from Susumu

487
00:42:14 --> 00:42:19
Tonegawa, another member of the MIT
faculty biology,

488
00:42:19 --> 00:42:24
and also runs Picower Center,
who got a Nobel Prize for

489
00:42:24 --> 00:42:30
understanding the basis of the
diversity of the immune system.

490
00:42:30 --> 00:42:35
What I just want to do for the
moment is just sort of point out the

491
00:42:35 --> 00:42:40
key features of what's called the
adaptive immune system.

492
00:42:40 --> 00:42:45
And this is one of the reasons that
we are able to live.

493
00:42:45 --> 00:42:50
And even though we get sick from
time to time, and we've all had one

494
00:42:50 --> 00:42:55
thing or another get us for a little
while during the semester,

495
00:42:55 --> 00:43:00
the reason we aren't sick all the
time, and the reason we recover when

496
00:43:00 --> 00:43:06
we get sick, as we have what's
called an adaptive immune system.

497
00:43:06 --> 00:43:10
What happens when people get
infected with HIV virus is the cells

498
00:43:10 --> 00:43:15
that it lives in and destroys are
key players in your adaptive immune

499
00:43:15 --> 00:43:19
system.  And to some people don't
die from the H1V infection itself,

500
00:43:19 --> 00:43:24
they died because lots of things
that we just, bacteria or fungi,

501
00:43:24 --> 00:43:29
whatever things we just have on us
and we live with all the time

502
00:43:29 --> 00:43:33
suddenly become killers because you
lack the immune system

503
00:43:33 --> 00:43:39
that fights them off.
So the so-called adaptive immune

504
00:43:39 --> 00:43:47
system is absolutely amazing.
So several features, it's got an

505
00:43:47 --> 00:43:55
incredible diversity,
there is a general word that's used

506
00:43:55 --> 00:44:03
to describe some sort of all sorts
of chemical entities, and

507
00:44:03 --> 00:44:09
it's called an antigen.
So anyway, this can recognize many,

508
00:44:09 --> 00:44:13
many what are called antigens.  And
at the moment I think you can just

509
00:44:13 --> 00:44:17
think of them as some kind of
chemical entity.

510
00:44:17 --> 00:44:22
It could be a carbohydrate.
It could be a little piece of an

511
00:44:22 --> 00:44:26
organic molecule.
It could be a few amino acids on a

512
00:44:26 --> 00:44:30
protein.  But it's something that's
potentially capable of being

513
00:44:30 --> 00:44:35
recognized by your immune system.
So, there are many,

514
00:44:35 --> 00:44:40
many, many things.  And the amazing
thing is I can go into a lab and

515
00:44:40 --> 00:44:45
synthesize a molecule that's never
been seen on this Earth before and

516
00:44:45 --> 00:44:49
challenge somebody with it,
and you'll produce an immune

517
00:44:49 --> 00:44:54
response that will be mounted
against that even though it's never

518
00:44:54 --> 00:44:59
been on Earth before.
It's also the specificity.

519
00:44:59 --> 00:45:05
It is completely amazing.
If I were to take a protein,

520
00:45:05 --> 00:45:12
and then, let's say, put on a phenyl
ring with a methyl there,

521
00:45:12 --> 00:45:19
inject it into someone, the immune
system would figure out how to

522
00:45:19 --> 00:45:27
recognize this thing with the phenyl
ring, and the methyl.

523
00:45:27 --> 00:45:32
But, the response it generated,
it would see this but not, let's say,

524
00:45:32 --> 00:45:38
that if I wanted to get an immune
system, something with methyl here,

525
00:45:38 --> 00:45:44
I'd have to put that into the
organism and let the immune system

526
00:45:44 --> 00:45:50
figure out a response.
So, the specificity is at the same

527
00:45:50 --> 00:45:56
kind of level that you are used to
here.  If restriction enzymes can

528
00:45:56 --> 00:46:02
read different sequences in DNA or
protein can tell one optical isomer

529
00:46:02 --> 00:46:08
of a small molecule from another,
it's this fitting of complementary

530
00:46:08 --> 00:46:13
shapes.
So, with the immune system is all

531
00:46:13 --> 00:46:17
about is figuring out how to get a
complementary shape somehow that's

532
00:46:17 --> 00:46:21
able to recognize essentially any
kind of chemical shape and structure

533
00:46:21 --> 00:46:26
you can think of.
It's just mind blowing.

534
00:46:26 --> 00:46:30
And, you could already see right
from the beginning,

535
00:46:30 --> 00:46:35
where the fundamental problem people
could see from the beginning.

536
00:46:35 --> 00:46:39
It sounds like we would need a
genome that's infinitely big,

537
00:46:39 --> 00:46:43
full of things that are ready to
recognize anything.

538
00:46:43 --> 00:46:47
And so, one of the real surprises
is, and now we know,

539
00:46:47 --> 00:46:51
is there is 20,000 genes are so in
the human genome.

540
00:46:51 --> 00:46:55
There can't possibly be a zillion
genes, each one specific for one of

541
00:46:55 --> 00:46:59
these structures.
There had to be some underlying

542
00:46:59 --> 00:47:04
principle that we had to learn.
And that was one of the big

543
00:47:04 --> 00:47:09
challenges in the immune system for
a long time.  Another one was that

544
00:47:09 --> 00:47:14
if you have an organism that has
this capacity,

545
00:47:14 --> 00:47:19
and you could recognize it,
why don't you do yourself in?

546
00:47:19 --> 00:47:24
Because you yourself are full of
entities that could,

547
00:47:24 --> 00:47:29
in principle, generate an immune
system.

548
00:47:29 --> 00:47:35
So, one of the other things the
immune system had to deal with was

549
00:47:35 --> 00:47:41
avoiding self recognition.
If you're able to recognize

550
00:47:41 --> 00:47:48
anything, how do I not avoid killing
my own selves?

551
00:47:48 --> 00:47:54
So, that is another really
fundamental problem in this immune

552
00:47:54 --> 00:48:00
system.  This is exciting.
We can all stop and watch,

553
00:48:00 --> 00:48:05
but I think I'll just try and keep
soldiering along for the last minute

554
00:48:05 --> 00:48:10
or so.  So, one other feature that
was interesting about the immune

555
00:48:10 --> 00:48:14
system, is it has a memory.
And I'll tell you more about

556
00:48:14 --> 00:48:19
antibodies at the beginning of next
lecture.  But,

557
00:48:19 --> 00:48:24
these are the kinds of molecule
that's able to recognize these

558
00:48:24 --> 00:48:29
different entities.
And you've all heard the term in

559
00:48:29 --> 00:48:34
your ordinary life.
But, if we look at the level of

560
00:48:34 --> 00:48:39
antibodies that are
made in the body,

561
00:48:39 --> 00:48:48
if the first exposure to an antigen
that would get some kind of response

562
00:48:48 --> 00:48:57
that comes up upon the first
exposure, and this is time here.

563
00:48:57 --> 00:49:03
If we let there be some delay,
it could be even into years, and

564
00:49:03 --> 00:49:09
then we get a second exposure,
the antigen, the response is much

565
00:49:09 --> 00:49:15
higher.  And this could be a log
scale.  So, it could be dramatically

566
00:49:15 --> 00:49:21
higher.  So, what was the basis of
that?  How does it work?

567
00:49:21 --> 00:49:27
You see right there the principle
of vaccination in the sense that if

568
00:49:27 --> 00:49:33
you ever got chickenpox as a kid,
your body has learned how to make

569
00:49:33 --> 00:49:37
antibodies.
So if you ever see it again,

570
00:49:37 --> 00:49:41
it mounts a really big immune
response.  If you want to have a

571
00:49:41 --> 00:49:45
disease something like tetanus that
you haven't seen,

572
00:49:45 --> 00:49:48
you go to the doctor and they squirt
and a bit of the stuff that doesn't

573
00:49:48 --> 00:49:52
make you sick,
but it gives you the initial immune

574
00:49:52 --> 00:49:56
response.  Then,
if you ever step on a rusty nail,

575
00:49:56 --> 00:50:00
you get a very powerful response
against tetanus.

576
00:50:00 --> 00:50:04
And that sort of the underlying
principle of vaccination is this

577
00:50:04 --> 00:50:09
concept of memory.
We'll pick that up on Wednesday.

578
00:50:09 --> 00:50:12
So, have a great Patriots Day
weekend.
