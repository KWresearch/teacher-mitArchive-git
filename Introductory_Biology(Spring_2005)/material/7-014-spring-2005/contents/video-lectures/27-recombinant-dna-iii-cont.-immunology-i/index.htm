<p></p>
<p>There was a little confusion with dideoxies in one sense, and some of  these things like the PCR you're going to have to sort of sit down and  actually think about it, but the principle of the dideoxies, if we were  making a chain of beads that had a hook on one end and a little hole on  the other, and we were joining these things together, we could make  obviously, a chain that went on. And then we could hook another one in,  and so on. And if we had a bunch of beads like this every now and then  we threw in a very small number that didn't have the hook on the end,  any time this particular chain were elongating and we put on one of  these things, the chain would stop because you haven't got any where to  join onto it.</p>
<p>You added dideoxy into a polymerase reaction. A  chain that gets the dideoxy doesn't have anything to join in the end,  and that will stop. If we only added this, the entire reaction would  stop, and everyone would come at the first time a dideoxy got  incorporated.</p>
<p>The trick is to put a little bit in. So, a few of  the molecules stop. Everything keeps going. The next time a dideoxy gets  incorporated, the chain will stop there. And out of this, you will  generate a family of polymers that are of different lengths. Each one  will terminate with a dideoxy nucleotide, and if the dideoxy nucleotide  we used in that particular reaction was, let's say, dideoxy ATP, that  means that an A was the last nucleotide added to every one of those. And  we can separate these on the basis of size. And if I ran them out on a  gel, I'd see something like that.</p>
<p>And that would tell me that when  that polymerase was coming along, that was the first time it saw an A. A  few stopped there, polymerized a few more. Then it put in another A,  put in some other things, and so on. And that by itself wouldn't tell us  the sequence. But if I did that reaction four times in a row, then I  could tell. In the old days, they didn't used to use dyes.</p>
<p>We just  did P32 on it as a label, and then you'd run the four reactions  side-by-side. And this would be with dideoxy ATP. You'd see a pattern  like that, and maybe with dideoxy TTP, you'd see something like this.  And when you got the rest of them, you'd kind of end up working out what  the sequence was by looking across the four lanes. This business of  using the dye is just one more step up in the engineering side that  enables the thing to be done automatically. And it's pretty well  explained in your textbooks.</p>
<p>OK, PCR, someone was confused as to  why we didn't just let the cell do it. Well, the cell does a great job,  but if you are a molecular biologist trying to understand the basis of  life or if you're a biological engineer, and you want to produce  something, you need to get hold of a particular piece of DNA. Or, if  you're a forensic investigator, and you've got a tiny, tiny sample of  human DNA, and you want to know whose it is, you have to make more of  it. And, that's what PCR is all about.</p>
<p>So I'm going to switch just  over to the net for a minute. I think this first site, I just want to  show you something, how somebody functions in a lab now with all these  genes out there. And then, I'm going to show you a little animation for  PCR that will help. So, if you just go to Google and type NCBI, that's  the National Center for Biotechnology Information. And, the Dolan  Learning Center is a center that Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory has set  up to teach people about DNA.</p>
<p>So let me just see here. So, let's  just go to, OK, let's use, whoops, this is going to seize on us. OK,  let's find how it happens. OK, so here's this National Center for  Biotechnology Information. There's all sorts of things you can search  for, and I'm not expecting you to know the site. I just want to sort of  give you a demo. If I was sitting in my office, this is the sort of  thing I can do easily. Rather than sequence looking for DNA sequence,  I'm going to look for the translated sequence of the protein that's  encoded by the gene where the computer's gone through and used the  genetic codes tell me the sequence of a protein. I told you about  sequencing a mismatch repair gene back in the 80s. It was called MutS,  and I'll put in Walker GC, and probably hopefully get us to the thing.  And there, the very first hit is DNA repair.</p>
<p>Protein MutS  salmonella typhimurium, that's the one I sequenced. So I'll just go to  that. It has various ways of displaying the sequence. I'm going to  switch to Fasta, which is a very easy way to see it. Now what you see is  the sequence of the protein using a one letter code, or one letter  stands for each amino acid. K is lysine. A is alanine, and so on. I'm  just going to copy that, that piece of sequence. OK so that's the  bacterial gene for mismatch repair.</p>
<p>At the time I put that in the  database, there wasn't anything else like it, except for the gene that  was Streptococcus pneumonia. But I found out, someone else is sequencing  by phoning around in the field. I'm going to go back to the main site  and I'm going to use a program called Blast, which lets you search the  entire database. I'll use a protein blast. I'm going to take a protein  sequence, and I'm going to ask what else is out there in terms of  protein sequences? I'll paste in this bacterial sequence, and then I'm  going to, if I can, manage this thing.</p>
<p>Let's see if I can get  myself down here. OK, over here I'll probably do, OK, so I'm going to  limit it, let's just search the human genome. That's all we've got to  do. And what did I have to do to get this thing to fit? Which button? Go  to the right. Can you just come up here for a second to help me get  this set up? I'm computer limited here apparently. OK, that one, OK,  great, so why do we not try this again? PAUSE] Sorry about this.</p>
<p>We'll  see if we can get this thing to go. I have what? Yeah, that's OK  though. That should be fine. Try again. Let's see if I can get the thing  to work. OK, so it's got it now. It'll tell me. It's searching all the  sequence that's out there. There's just an unbelievable amount of  sequence. That's just how long it took. It's showing me here a  diagrammatic representation of the things. Then I can see that the very  first it was MutS homolog three for humans. And if I go down here, we  can actually see on alignment of the bacterial gene on the top line, and  the lines below is the sequence of that particular human homolog. And  you can see in between all the things that are in common, and  particularly down at the C-terminus of the protein, you can see there's  very strong conservation.</p>
<p>You may not think that that's  impressive, but remember for every one of those positions, there's 20  possibilities. So, if you get that many in a row, that's the same gene  basically. And when you take the structure, the structure's going to be  very, very similar. And it does mismatch repair in both.</p>
<p>Just to  try and give you an idea of how you do sequence now, because with all  these genomes done, you do the vast majority of it by computer, rather  than some other way. I want to take you and show you this. DNA learning:  if you go there, the second thing is a set of animations. Go to the  animations. There's one on polymerase chain reaction. And, I'm going to  just show you this because this is a nice little, let's see if we can  get this thing to center. OK we'll have to see whether this is going to  work. OK, so this is the principle of, you can go do this at your  leisure, but the idea is to heat the DNA up, the strands come apart.  Then, were going to take these two little primers, not promoters, which I  think someone was confused about, a little piece of DNA that  complimentary, and anneal them.</p>
<p>Than we added DNA polymerase. You  know what happens then. We extend those primers. That was the first  cycle. Do the same thing again. Go to the second cycle. This is what I  was drawing on the board the other day. Now are going to denature the  DNA. The strands come apart. Let's let the polymerase extend them. Let's  go to the third cycle, denature the DNA, anneal the primers, extend the  primers, and now for the first time, we've got what we were shooting  for. We have a double-stranded copy of just the DNA that was defined  between those primers.</p>
<p>OK, I think this actually, I'm going to go  back one. Oops, OK. If you go, then, to the amplification graph, what  they're doing here is they're showing you what happens as you do  successive cycles. So, at the first, oh, it's down here. Just a minute.  If we do the first cycle, we end up with two DNA copies. That's just  plotting what I showed you. The next one: we have four. We haven't yet  got to this target sequence. By the next cycle, we now have two copies  of the target sequence plus these other things.</p>
<p>But if you keep  going, let's say by the time we're at seven cycles, the number of  targets is up to 114. The number of DNA copies is 128. But, if we keep  going like this, we'll find out that the target copies become the vast  majority of the sequences that are in there. So, by the time that you're  up in the 30 cycles, or something like that, there's only a handful of  the original things, or almost all, and that, I hope will help some of  you who might have had problems with understanding the PCR. So, what I'm  going to do is tell you a few more things about what you can do with  recombinant DNA, this recombinant DNA technology, because it's just so  powerful.</p>
<p>And I can only sort of give you a few ideas, and show  you a few variations. But, most of these things are just taking  principles that you've already learned as part of the basic biology I'm  trying to tell you, and then using them like an engineer to achieve some  applied purpose. For example suppose I wanted to produce a human  protein, and try and produce it in a bacterium.</p>
<p>That would be  great. I could take the one gene. I could grow a fermenter load of E.  coli, and if I got it right, then I'd be able to make a lot of this  protein instead of trying to isolate it from some human source or  something like that. There's a couple of problems. We talked about them.  One is the problem of promoters. Another one is that human DNA would  have introns in it.</p>
<p>And, bacteria doesn't recognize the human  promoters. It wouldn't start to make an RNA in the right place, and it  doesn't know what to do about splicing out the intron. So, let's address  the intron first. There is a way of handling that that's quite easy.  And that's what's called to make cDNA library. So, if we have DNA, and  then we get the RNA, we get the RNA copy [SOUND OFF/THEN ON] including  these intron sequences. And then what happens, this is RNA splicing that  we talked about. And what we get out of that would be an mRNA, in which  the introns have been removed. So, eukaryotic cells, my cells, know how  to express the gene, so they make the RNA, they know how to get rid of  the introns.</p>
<p>So, if I were to isolate a messenger RNA. That's been  spliced from me, or you, or anything, what we would have is a  population of RNA molecules that don't have introns anymore. Anybody  remember any way we could get from RNA back to DNA? Reverse  transcriptase. So, if we used reverse transcriptase, that protein that  David Baltimore discovered and viruses, and which retroviruses use, now  we would have a signle stranded DNA copy of the mRNA. And then, we could  use an ordinary DNA polymerase to get ourselves to double-stranded DNA.</p>
<p>We'd  be doing, in essence, exactly what one of these retroviruses does. This  would give us what's known as a cDNA library, where the genes don't  have introns anymore. So, if I wanted to get at one of my proteins, one  of my genes, and think about expressing it in E. coli, what I would do  is go looking in a cDNA library using a sort of approach as we've done,  trying to find my gene of interest, because if I use the cDNA library  now it would just be like a bacterial gene. You could see the ATG start.</p>
<p>You  could get out your handy little genetic code, and you could walk along,  and read out the sequence of the protein. So, that's part of what you  need to do if you wanted to make, say, a protein inside of a bacterium.  The other one which we talked about was since the promoters are not a  universal language, what E. coli RNA polymerase sees is different than  what human RNA polymerase sees as a start site. I would have to add in a  promoter that would drive the expression of this open reading frame if I  wanted it to work in E.</p>
<p>coli. And that's fairly easily done, too.  A general thing that's for this is called expression cloning. And it  would be more or less the same idea. We'd have a vector that had a  cloning site. It has an origin of replication, and maybe there's a  selectable marker such as the drug resistance. That's the basic kind of  factor that I talked about before. However, if I clone in a piece of DNA  into that, it has to have a promoter that can be read in the organism  working with, because it's just out whatever nature gave it, whatever  promoter that would be in front of that. But, if I were to now into this  vector put an E.</p>
<p>coli promoter right there, now, if I just  downstream of that put any open reading frame, human protein lets say,  which we've gotten rid of the introns, the human genes minus its  introns, which you got from the cDNA library, now when the bacterial  polymerase came along, it would be copying, making it a messenger RNA  for human protein, and we could get it out of that. And the beauty of  that, suppose we took the front part of the Lac operator, we would have a  regulated promoter.</p>
<p>It would be just everything we studied about  Lac if we were to starve it for, you know, we have to get rid of  glucose, and then if we added lactose or some kind of synthetic inducer,  we can turn the promoter on and off. So, you could grow an entire  fermenter load of bacteria without expressing the gene. And then, once  you had the bacteria all grown up, you could throw in something that  would normally induce the expression of the Lac regulatory system. And  now, instead of making beta galactosidase, instead it would make the  protein that you are interested in, you with me? It's very pretty.</p>
<p>And  in fact, so much of what you can see in this is, these really basic  studies, since the Lac system was one of the first to really be worked  out in detail, we use its parts. And, there are many vectors around now  that have exactly that. They have the Lac promoter, and you can turn  things on and off in a regulated way, so not only provide a promoter  that works in the organism, but it also gives you a measure of control.</p>
<p>There's  another very cute trick, and what we've done sort of here is we took,  say, the promoter for Lac in the regulatory region. I'll use R to stand  for regulatory region, and then this would be the LacZ sequence. What  we've really done, is we've taken a gene from somewhere else, let's call  it gene X that had a promoter from gene X. And, in essence, is cutting  each of them here. And, now we take the regulatory promoter region from  Lac and we put down below it gene X. And, now we've got this gene whose  products we're interested in producing in a fermenter under the control  of the Lac operon. Well, there's another kind of thing we can do.</p>
<p>We  can do the other way around. We could take LacZ, which makes beta  galactosidase. We could put it under the promoter regulatory region of  gene X. Well, what will happen then? If that construct is sitting in a  cell, anytime that the cell decides to make gene X, instead it will make  beta galactosidase, which is really easy to assay for. And, this sort  of strategy, you'd use something like LacZ as a reporter. In this case  beta galactosidase synthesis, which you can assay for, reports when is  the promoter of gene X is functioning.</p>
<p>This reporter gene now has  the regulatory characteristics that are imposed upon it by that  particular promoter. So, there's this picture that I've showed you, this  little movie I showed you early on. You've seen it a couple of times.  In this case, the reporter is green fluorescent protein. What Barbara  Meyer, who made this particular construct, did was they took the gene  for green florescent protein which started out in a jellyfish as you may  remember. And, the protein folds up, and ends up being fluorescent.</p>
<p>So,  we can tell when it's expressed very easily. And in this case, you'll  notice not all of the genes in the whole worm isn't glowing. And so,  it's under the control of the promoter regulatory region that is  expressed only in specific body parts. And so, you can see where that  promoter is working by just looking at the worm. In the case of  something like the mouse that we talked about, it's a pretty uniform  expression at least in the skin. So, that was probably, in that case,  the green fluorescent protein was probably put in a promoter that's  expressed in probably most of the cells in the body, at least certainly  all the ones in the mouse cell. I don't know the details of that. Ditto  over here. It was probably something that was expressed in most of the  body cells, but you also could have put something that was just  expressed in some very little bits.</p>
<p>So, depending on how you do  the construct, there are a lot of different things that people can do in  this sort of thing. OK, one more category that comes out of the sort of  thing, is if we have a gene of some type, I don't know what it does but  I'd like to find out. You know, at least budding geneticists, know what  we'd like to do.</p>
<p>We'd probably just like to disable that gene  very specifically, and then look at the live organism to see what  happens. And, the principle is the same whether you're doing it in E.  coli or a mouse. It gets a little more complicated for technical reasons  doing it in a mouse. But the idea is exactly the same. And here's the  strategy. So, we'll just take a piece of DNA from the organism. And  sitting at here is this open reading frame that we've seen. We don't  know what its function is. We think if I could knock it out, get rid of  its function, I'll look at the organism. Maybe I can make a guess then.  So, if we were to cut the gene somewhere with a restriction site, and  then we were to take, for example, a gene encoding a drug resistance or  something like that, and insert it at that point, what we would end up  with is this piece of the organism's DNA. The first part of gene X, then  a drug resistance, then the last part of gene X, and some more sequence  from the organism.</p>
<p>Now, this would be, we'd have this in a test  tube. We could do it by the kind of recombinant DNA manipulations that  we have. And what would happen if I were to put, now, let's keep it with  bacteria where it's easy to see. If I were to take that piece of DNA,  put it inside a living cell, what's going to happen? Well, let's make  this, say, here's the end of it.</p>
<p>That's all we've got. Well,  inside the living cell, we of course have the entire genome. And then we  come to this part. We have gene X. Then we'd have this going. That  would be the whole thing. Well, this particular piece doesn't have an  origin of replication. It's not joined to a vector. It's just sitting  there. So, if the cell divides, it's not going to get replicated. So, if  I select for a drug resistance that's on that piece of DNA, unless  something happens I'm not going to get a drug-resistant bacteria. But  you do know a way that this thing could join to an origin of  replication. It could join to the origin of replication that's on the  bacteria chromosome.</p>
<p>And, the way to do it would be by undergoing  genetic recombination over here, because this DNA is exactly the same as  on that side, and over here it's the same thing. This DNA is the same  as that side. So, if that genetic exchange happened, what would happen,  even if it happened rarely, was this piece of DNA would replace the  piece of DNA that's in there. I'd be able to tell it was there because  I'd just select for drug resistance.</p>
<p>And even if it only happened  only one in 500,000 cells, it wouldn't matter because up would growth  the colony that now has the drug in the middle of gene X. Gene X is  gone, and I could look at the organism if it's alive and see if it has a  phenotype. If it's an essential gene, that strategy obviously won't  work, and when people do the more complicated thing of doing this kind  of experiment to make a transgenic mouse, it takes about a year to go  from our DNA manipulation all the way to the live mouse with a disrupted  gene. And sometimes what they find after spending half of your PhD. is  that that was an essential gene. And, there's no live mouse, or it made  it two days into being an embryo and it tanked at that point. But, this  again, you could see, we talked about going back and forth between gene,  protein, and trying to figure out function.</p>
<p>All I can sort of do  is give you the flavor of what's going on. But one sort of overarching  thing I hope you remember going through this is DNA sequencing, PCR, all  these kinds of manipulations we're talking about are just exploiting  these basic cellular components that we learned about studying, how does  DNA replicate? How is information coded? How do genes get expressed?  How does genetic information gets sorted between cells? It's simply  applying those relatively well understood tools, or sort of biological  principles and parts that we learned about, and now using them as tools  in an engineering way, and have just completely transformed the way  biology has been done in the last couple decades.</p>
<p>And it's just,  as I say, things are changing so, so fast. It's almost breathtaking. So,  the last little bit of sort of technique oriented stuff, I just want to  at least make sure I've mentioned what are called microarrays. You  often hear these referred to as DNA chips. The principle here is this is  a way that lets you ask, not only whether one gene is being expressed  or not under a particular condition, whether its RNA is being made, and  in most cases that means making protein, or whether it's off, or whether  it's at some intermediate level.</p>
<p>A microarray lets you do that  experiment with many, many, many genes at once. And here's the  principle. You take some surface, and there will be a bunch of, if you  will, sites on the surface, on this chip or whatever. And, what will go  to be attached here would be a little piece of DNA from gene one. I  mean, let's say, maybe a hundred nucleotides: that would be far more  than enough to make it absolutely specific that they could only  hybridize to a messenger RNA from gene one, and not from anything else.</p>
<p>And,  this one, then, would have from gene two, this one, from gene three,  and so on. Then, if we were to take a messenger RNA preparation from,  say, an organism if it's a little one, or maybe a tissue, or something  like that, anywhere you could isolate RNA from. And then, we'll label it  in some kind of way, and we can label it radioactivity, we can label it  with dyes. It's usually done with dyes, and there are a variety of  variations on this. Those are sort of technical details how to do it.  But here's the principle. Let's just, for the moment, just consider that  it's got a label on it.</p>
<p>So if we take the messenger RNA, and take  this little chip that has samples in the extreme, it could be a sample  of every single gene that's in the genome of that organism, we take this  labeled RNA, actually what we would usually do is to use this to make a  labeled cDNA preparation, which would be a copy of each one of these  things. That the technically easy way to get label into it.</p>
<p>But  what we do have is if the gene was on, its messenger RNA would be on,  and we'd have a bunch of stuff corresponding to gene one that had label  on it. And if we give it a chance, that will, then, hybridize here. And  there would be some way of detecting this label. If gene two was off in  that sample, there won't be any hybridization. There won't be any  signal. You can sort of see in principle what you're doing is you're  interrogating each gene in the extreme, each gene in the organism under  some condition. Is it on? Is it off? If you did various samples, and you  could see maybe it's in an intermediate level, and so on. So, the chips  look like that, 50-100,000 genes perhaps, something like that.</p>
<p>These  things are really small. Here's sort of a display of a simple one, and  this is one where they're taking RNA. The samples are from two  conditions. One's labeled with a dye that's green, and one's labeled  with a dye that's red. And, if you get equal amounts, it looks yellow.  So, they mix the two things together, and if the gene is the same under  two conditions it would be yellow. Under one condition, if the gene was  on in condition one than it would be green, and off in two, and back and  forth.</p>
<p>So, without trying to get lost in the technical details  right now, which doesn't matter, the principle of this thing is that you  can take, you can sort of, by making a preparation of RNA, then you can  use these DNA chips and say, is each gene on and off? Or if I switch  conditions, who comes on and off? So, it's a little like, I think of it  this way.</p>
<p>It's like having, all right, who's on today? And a  number of hands go up, or something. And the rest of you would be off.  But, come back on Monday, and I say to the something or other, and a  different set of you would put up hands. And what I'm kind of looking at  are the changes between that. And the sort of thing where this has been  so powerful, for example, is there are kind of cancers for which there  is a treatment, but it was only 20% successful. And, when people started  to study these cancers and then looked to see what genes were on, what  they realized was even though physicians had given these cancers a  particular name, if you looked at which genes were being expressed, they  fell into two classes, class A and class B.</p>
<p>And what they then  realized was that the treatment they were using was 100% effective of  tumors of class A, and wasn't doing anything for the tumors of class B.  The physician couldn't tell the difference between these two types of  tumors, but a microarray can say it. And once you have that kind of  insight, if somebody has a tumor of the type A, you can use the  treatment. It's very effective. And of course, when people are trying to  do now would be to develop an equivalently effective treatment for  something for the tumor of type B. So, again we have so little time in  this class.</p>
<p>I could go on basically for ages. There's the output  of the real sort of DNA chip. You can see things are very dense, and the  great cleverness in doing these things, people now use the technology  that goes with LaserJet printers to actually synthesize little pieces of  either DNA or proteins starting on a little spot on each membrane, or  on the chip, or whatever. You put it on one nucleotide and then you put  it on the next, and the next, and the next.</p>
<p>You could sequence it  using technology that's already around for inkjet printers at that kind  of thing. So here you've seen a fusion of different types of  engineering. OK, the last thing I'm going to tell you about is a little  bit about the immune system. We've run into this. This is a movie that  some of you liked, got the biggest aw I think of the last part of the  course anyway. But what we are seeing here is a white blood cell pushing  aside from red blood cells, which are stationary, and chasing a  bacterium. It's obvious that it can trace it. It's able to recognize  some things, and at some point, then, it took it up. The principle of  what happened there was this white blood cell had a capacity to  recognize the bacteria, then bind to it. And then, its membrane, this is  the membrane, and this is a white blood cell.</p>
<p>There's many types  of these, and it pinches the membrane off. So you have the bacterium.  This is the bacterium. And, it's inside a little membrane compartment,  as if the bacteria is in a little soap bubble. And the principle of what  happens is the white blood cell has another soap bubble that's full of  poison. And, if you took two soap bubbles and push them together, you  know what happens. They'll fuse, and you'll get a bigger soap bubble.  And that's, in essence, how these white blood cells normally kill  bacteria. They would bring together these two compartments. Now you have  a bacteria and a poison within a white blood cell at the bacterium,  would get killed.</p>
<p>And we talked about how bacteria fought back.  That was a streptococcus that has a capsule. And the capsule, by having  polysaccharide on the outside, prevent the white blood cell from being  able to grab hold of some feature of the bacteria, that starts this  process of killing it. And when I told you the story of how DNA was  found, it was people studying pneumonia. If you remember, it was  streptococcus. If the streptococcus had a capsule, and the people would  get very sick. And after five or six days, there would be a crisis where  they either lived, or they died. And what would happen in that time is  that, the last thing I'll tell you about, what's called the adaptive  immune system would have generated special recognition molecules called  antibodies that would have learns to recognize the capsule at that  bacterium. And once those were there, now those white blood cells would  be able to capture the bacterium, because the antibodies give it a hand  in recognizing there was something there that needed to be killed.</p>
<p>The  way this adaptive immune system works, it's almost like science  fiction. And I'll tell you the molecular basis of it. The key insight  came from Susumu Tonegawa, another member of the MIT faculty biology,  and also runs Picower Center, who got a Nobel Prize for understanding  the basis of the diversity of the immune system. What I just want to do  for the moment is just sort of point out the key features of what's  called the adaptive immune system.</p>
<p>And this is one of the reasons  that we are able to live. And even though we get sick from time to time,  and we've all had one thing or another get us for a little while during  the semester, the reason we aren't sick all the time, and the reason we  recover when we get sick, as we have what's called an adaptive immune  system. What happens when people get infected with HIV virus is the  cells that it lives in and destroys are key players in your adaptive  immune system.</p>
<p>And to some people don't die from the H1V infection  itself, they died because lots of things that we just, bacteria or  fungi, whatever things we just have on us and we live with all the time  suddenly become killers because you lack the immune system that fights  them off. So the so-called adaptive immune system is absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>So  several features, it's got an incredible diversity, there is a general  word that's used to describe some sort of all sorts of chemical  entities, and it's called an antigen. So anyway, this can recognize  many, many what are called antigens. And at the moment I think you can  just think of them as some kind of chemical entity. It could be a  carbohydrate. It could be a little piece of an organic molecule. It  could be a few amino acids on a protein. But it's something that's  potentially capable of being recognized by your immune system. So, there  are many, many, many things.</p>
<p>And the amazing thing is I can go  into a lab and synthesize a molecule that's never been seen on this  Earth before and challenge somebody with it, and you'll produce an  immune response that will be mounted against that even though it's never  been on Earth before. It's also the specificity. It is completely  amazing. If I were to take a protein, and then, let's say, put on a  phenyl ring with a methyl there, inject it into someone, the immune  system would figure out how to recognize this thing with the phenyl  ring, and the methyl. But, the response it generated, it would see this  but not, let's say, that if I wanted to get an immune system, something  with methyl here, I'd have to put that into the organism and let the  immune system figure out a response.</p>
<p>So, the specificity is at the  same kind of level that you are used to here. If restriction enzymes  can read different sequences in DNA or protein can tell one optical  isomer of a small molecule from another, it's this fitting of  complementary shapes. So, with the immune system is all about is  figuring out how to get a complementary shape somehow that's able to  recognize essentially any kind of chemical shape and structure you can  think of.</p>
<p>It's just mind blowing. And, you could already see right  from the beginning, where the fundamental problem people could see from  the beginning. It sounds like we would need a genome that's infinitely  big, full of things that are ready to recognize anything. And so, one of  the real surprises is, and now we know, is there is 20,000 genes are so  in the human genome. There can't possibly be a zillion genes, each one  specific for one of these structures. There had to be some underlying  principle that we had to learn. And that was one of the big challenges  in the immune system for a long time.</p>
<p>Another one was that if you  have an organism that has this capacity, and you could recognize it, why  don't you do yourself in? Because you yourself are full of entities  that could, in principle, generate an immune system. So, one of the  other things the immune system had to deal with was avoiding self  recognition. If you're able to recognize anything, how do I not avoid  killing my own selves? So, that is another really fundamental problem in  this immune system. This is exciting. We can all stop and watch, but I  think I'll just try and keep soldiering along for the last minute or so.</p>
<p>So,  one other feature that was interesting about the immune system, is it  has a memory. And I'll tell you more about antibodies at the beginning  of next lecture. But, these are the kinds of molecule that's able to  recognize these different entities. And you've all heard the term in  your ordinary life. But, if we look at the level of antibodies that are  made in the body, if the first exposure to an antigen that would get  some kind of response that comes up upon the first exposure, and this is  time here.</p>
<p>If we let there be some delay, it could be even into  years, and then we get a second exposure, the antigen, the response is  much higher. And this could be a log scale. So, it could be dramatically  higher. So, what was the basis of that? How does it work? You see right  there the principle of vaccination in the sense that if you ever got  chickenpox as a kid, your body has learned how to make antibodies. So if  you ever see it again, it mounts a really big immune response.</p>
<p>If  you want to have a disease something like tetanus that you haven't  seen, you go to the doctor and they squirt and a bit of the stuff that  doesn't make you sick, but it gives you the initial immune response.  Then, if you ever step on a rusty nail, you get a very powerful response  against tetanus. And that sort of the underlying principle of  vaccination is this concept of memory. We'll pick that up on Wednesday.  So, have a great Patriots Day weekend.</p>
