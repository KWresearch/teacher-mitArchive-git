Transcript â€“ Lecture 19 

So, today we're going to ta lk about, we've talked about primary productivity on a 
global sca le last time. And today, we're going to ta lk about what regulates that 
productivity. In other words, last time we just ta lked about on average the amount 
of carbon and b iomass that was distributed among the ecosystems of the globe. And 
we talked about deficiencies of transfer of that b iomass through food webs, etc. 

By the way, the one universa l thing that everybody seems to  like are the DVDs at 
the end of the class, which is good. Unfortunately, in today's class we are not going 
to have one. So you have something to look forward to on Wednesday. I'll show you 
one at the end that  is rea lly one of the cooler ones of the collection. It has nothing to 
do with the  lecture but I'm going to show it to you anyway. OK, so today we are 
going to ta lk about what regulates the productivity. 

We've talked about these comp lex systems in ecology, and the feedback 
mechanisms. So, in the context of productivity we're going to talk about the factors, 
the ab iotic factors, to the non-living parts of the Earth, that regulate this productivity 
and how the productivity feeds back on those. And then Wednesday, we're going to 
put it all together in an analysis of global biogeochemical cycles, how the elements in 
the g lobe cycle, and how that's mediated by organisms. 

And then, that w ill be the end of the segment. And when I come back, we're going to 
move on to population and community ecology, which will feel like a totally different 
subject to you. So, we'll talk more about organisms. And some of you said it was so 
interesting to see math last time in the last lecture even if they were just efficiencies. 

Well, when you get to population ecology, you're going  to have real math and you'll 
actually have d ifferential equations. So, if you like that you have something to look 
forward to. If you don't like it, well, it's not too bad. OK, so today the lecture w ill be 
in two ha lves. We'll talk about terrestria l productivity, and then aquatic productivity 
and what regulates it. And, can you see in the back or do I need to turn, I'm going to 
have to turn the lights down, never mind. 

So, because we have some colored images, so let's start with terrestrial productivity. 
And look at this map, oops, wrong ones. I think that might be enough to see it, 
which is a satellite image. You've seen severa l of these so far. So just show ing the 
gradients of productivity on a g lobal sca le, where we're just looking at the land now. 
Where it's green, you have high levels of productivity. 

These are grams carbon per meter squared per year. Yellow is intermed iate, and  red 
is very low levels of productivity. So, what determines this distribution of productivity 
in terrestria l ecosystems? Well, got any ideas? This  is not hard. What's a key factor 
in regulating plant growth on land? Light, absolutely. That's a given. But looking at 
this map, what's probab ly more important? Water, exactly. If we p lot on a global 
sca le, if we go around to a ll these ecosystems, and we look at the average annual 
rainfa ll and we p lot it against net primary productivity, you a ll know what NPP is 
right, net primary productivity, you get a graph that look something like this. 

Each one of these dots would be an ecosystem. And this one  is millimeters rain per 
year. So, desp ite the Sahara Desert, and this might be a tropical rain forest. And 
they scatter, but there's some sort of general relationship like that, increasing NPP 
with increasing rainfa ll. Well, what else is probably important? What else is different 
between the Sahara Desert and the northern US? Temperature. 

Exactly, which is not a good example for comparison. Let's take tropical rain  forests 
and the northern US. How 's that? But you get something like this. In other words, it 
doesn't a lways map directly onto temperature a lone. But on average, you find that 
places w ith higher temperature have higher productivity if there's adequate water. 
So, does a relationship, there's an interaction between the water and the 
temperature. 

So, those are the key factors for terrestrial ecosystems. Now, what we have, so 
there's light, nutrients, I mean  light, ra in, and temperature, rainfa ll. What about 
nutrients? Anybody who's had p lants and their room, or nurtured our garden knows 
that nutrients are very important. You have to fertilize in order to get the most 
growth. So, how does that work? Well, now we are going to do an analysis of a 
terrestrial ecosystem. 

We're going to use a tree. Some ecosystems you have, that's a  rock in case you 
didn't recognize it. And we have soil. These are components. And, we've ta lked 
about this over, and over, and over now. Photosynthesis  is the key, taking up CO2, 
evolving oxygen, we are going to ca ll this b iosynthesis. That's the mass from gas. 
So, that's CO2 p lus, and now we're going to add something. And these are not 
balanced chemica l reactions, OK? These are just to give you an idea of what's going 
on. 

So, CO2 plus, there's all the elements required for life, OK? In other words, for a 
plant to grow,  it doesn't only need CO2 and water. It needs a ll of these elements 
required for life. And they are converted to organic forms of those elements. And 
then oxygen is evolved. So, we are in a genera l sense, just mod ifying the equation 
for photosynthesis to include all of the elements that are required for life. 

So that's the b iosynthesis. And then, the tree,  these are leaves in case you didn't 
recognize them, that are fa lling to the soil. And the leaves fall down to the soil and 
they become, what? What's that organic manner? You  learn  it last time. It's the 
whale falling to the bottom of the ocean, and if that was a carcass, the general term 
for dead, organic matter is ca lled detritus. 

And there is a detritivore food web, remember? And we had some discussion w ith 
students after class whether we were detritivores, because in a sense we are 
because we eat dead meat, right? We don't eat live meat. It doesn't matter. You 
don't have to know that. Forget that. But it's interesting to think about. So, the 
leaves fall down to the soil. 

They are acted upon by the heterotrophic bacteria, the bacteria that use organic 
carbon. And, what happens is that those bacteria and fungi, and worms, and 
everything that chews on organic matter are responsible for regenerating these 
elements in the soil. So, we are going to call that regeneration. And that's basically, 
simply the back reaction of this, OK? So, you are starting w ith organic carbon. 

And, organic carbon, organic PNS, and it's converting it back to the inorganic forms 
so that they're available for the tree to take up again. So, this is the cycle of 
biosynthesis regeneration, and then take it up again. Some of the feedback I got on 
the lectures when peop le said that they found it interesting to think about how 
everything in nature is recycled and used. Now,  in some ecosystems, there's another 
form of ava ilable nutrients: calcium here, you have cations, potassium  from rocks, 
magnesium. 

All of these are also in this equation. When I go dot, dot, dot, dot, it's every element 
that's required for life. And in some ecosystems, the dissolution of these elements 
from rocks is an important renewa l route for nutrients in the ecosystem, OK? So 
these are the two, basically in terrestria l ecosystems, there is the rock source, and 
there's the regeneration source. And it turns out that different terrestrial ecosystems 
have different relative dependence on these two sources. 

And this is an interesting phenomena. So, trop ical rain forests, like in the Amazon, 
these are the forests that we're concerned about losing  for many reasons. And these 
have, essentially, no number one up here. Trop ical rain  forests have essentially no 
renewal nutrients from bedrock. And temperate forests, however, have a 
combination of one and  two. They can have renewal. The bedrock is exposed, and 
the water cycle helps dissolve the rock, and  renews the nutrients to the system. 

So, if we look at the soil to b iomass ratio of phosphorus and nitrogen in the 
temperate forests versus the tropical, we see something like this. In the trop ical ra in 
forests, a ll of the nutrients in the system are basically tied up in the biomass. And 
it's highly dependent, then, on this regeneration cycle. The trees fa ll down,  it's 
regenerated, it's taken up right away from the soil whereas in the temperate system, 
you see the opposite where there's a much higher proportion of nutrients in the soil 
relative to the tropica l system. 

And what that means is that if you cut down a tropica l ra in forest, which they're 
doing, converting to farmland, you w ill only get a few years of productivity out of 
that farmland because once you shut down the forests and haul away the trees, 
you've hauled away most of the nutrients in that ecosystem that are ava ilable to fuel 
productivity. And they can't be renewed from bedrock because they don't have 
bedrock there. 

So, that's one of the traged ies of cutting down these forests when they probably 
would have more economic value by harvesting some of the natural products from 
the forests. OK, so when we get to aquatic productivity, we are going to see that we 
have these same biosynthesis and regeneration processes. So, that's what we're 
going to move to now. And let's look at the distribution of aquatic productivity. 

That's too much. A while. Can you see that in the back OK, the colors? All right. So, 
now we're just looking at the ocean's ecosystem. And areas that are b lue and green 
are less productive than the areas that are red and yellow in the system. So you can 
see all of the coasta l reg ions; we have coastal upwelling that we're going to talk 
about a lot w ith nutrients fueling that, that is very  important. 

And the whole north Atlantic here we'll talk about that. But before we ta lk about 
what regulates aquatic productivity, now I am going to turn the lights out, I thought 
I'd g ive you a tour. Since you all know trees look like but you don't know what 

primary producers in the ocean ecosystems look like, I'm going to give you a quick 
tour through the phytoplankton, which as you know, are my favorite organisms. 

So, the aquatic productivity is dominated by these microscopic p lants. There are over 
20,000 species, but we really have no idea how many there are. Wherever there's 
water, they exist. They range from 0.5 to 1,000 Âµm in d iameter. And as I told you in 
the first lecture, there's as much genetic information in a liter of seawater that 
contains these primary producers and a ll the bacteria that they live with than there is 
in the human genome. 

So here's some of my favorites. These are marine diatoms. This is a silicon shell. 
This is a single cell. It's about 30 Âµm in diameter. And this is made out of amorphous 
silicon. It's essentially opa l. And here's another one. They come in different shapes 
and sizes. They're just rea lly incredibly beautiful. And peop le are just starting to 
study what mechanisms are responsib le for laying down these exquisite 
architectures. 

Here's another one. To me this a lways remind me of the Coliseum  for some reason. 
These are p illbox shaped cells. And they have two ha lves like that. And when they 
grow, when they divide, one half lays down another half inside of it. Now, what's 
going to happen ultimately if these are rig id? They get sma ller. One  lineage gets 
sma ller, and smaller, and sma ller. Well, both of them get smaller, and sma ller. 

And this group of organisms has this really neat system where when it gets really 
tiny, they differentiate into egg and sperm. They mate, and that they make a giant 
cell again. And they start the whole thing. It's cool. Just to show you some of the 
things people have studied, people have wondered why have they evolved this very 
heavy armor? And of course, the first thing you think about is resistance to 
predation. 

But there was never any evidence for that. And so, I just found this recent study in 
nature that shows where they actually measured. I thought MIT students  look like 
this because they actually measure the force that it takes to crush one of these cells. 
Here's the study. There is a diatom frustule and they're putting a measured force on 
it to see what would crush it. And they were able to show that the amount of force 
that it takes is enough to have a selective advantage against the crunching parts of 
the zooplankton that eat them. 

I a lso want to point out,  this is from the website of Dr. Angela Belcher, who is a 
professor here at MIT  in material sciences. And she is studying diatoms. Here's a 
diatom. She's studying them as a material, this amorphous silicon,  looking at the 
way it's la id down. And she's also studying coccolithophores, which is another group 
of my favorite organisms. They have these calcium carbonate plates. 

Again, this is a single cell. But its cell wall is made up of calcium carbonate plates. 
And they come in all d ifferent shapes and sizes. Here's a  really weird one with these 
huge, they're called coccoliths. And these cells, this  is a satellite image of reflection, 
of light. In these cells, the ca lcium carbonate, reflects light. And this is a 
coccolithophore b loom somewhere I think in the Bering Sea. 

And we can measure these, but we have no idea what causes a particular species to 
bloom at a particular point in time. It's one of the challenges of oceanography. 
Here's another group of organisms. The cyanobacteria: we've ta lked about them a 

little bit. These are prokaryotic cells that can fix nitrogen. They're one of the few 
groups of microbes that can take nitrogen gas from the atmosphere and convert it to 
ammonia, which draws it in to the food web. 

So you can actually see a b loom here. That one's ca lled trichodesmium. It grows out 
in the open Atlantic and Pacific. Here's a b loom of trichodesmium sucking nitrogen 
into  the ecosystem, converting it into ammonia, making it ava ilab le to the other 
organisms. Here's the organism we work on, unfortunately very boring looking, not 
as exciting looking at the other ones. And now, this  is just under a light microscope. 

These are less than a micron in d iameter. But if you shine b lue light on them, they 
fluoresce red. The chlorophyll in them fluoresces red. And these are the smallest and 
simplest photosynthetic cell. They have 1,700 genes. And with that, I call them  the 
essence of life because w ith 1,700 genes, they can convert CO2, nitrogen, 
phosphorus, all  inorganic compounds, basically this rock over here, in sunlight  into 
life. And this happens to be life that dominates the oceans. 

They are the most abundant cell in the oceans. In some areas,  it's about 50% of the 
tota l chlorophyll. So, they are basica lly a  lean, mean photosynthesis machine, and 
we're trying to understand everything about them. OK, does a digression, hopefully 
not a d iversion. So, what regulates aquatic primary productivity? Have to turn the 
lights back on. Before we get into that tota lly, I want to draw a typ ica l, what we ca ll 
a water column in an aquatic ecosystem. 

And I have seen this little red, sticky thing here. This is from  last year, and it says 
they don't understand these axes. See, I remember from year to year. So, if you 
don't understand something I'm doing, because I can tell when students come up 
afterwards that I've completely lost you. First of all, oceanographers plot things 
upside down. 

So this is depth. So, depth goes down, which makes sense, right? And then, 
whatever we are p lotting aga inst depth is on this axis. So, in this graph I'm going to 
make, we are going to plot net primary productivity, temperature, nutrients, a bunch 
of different variables. OK, and for oceans, this is about, well, we'll just say 2,000 m, 
and for lakes, say, 200 m for a deep lake. So, I'm drawing here sort of a generic 
picture of a water column in either a lake or ocean. 

OK, so do we have colored chalk? Not here, OK. Sometimes it used to float around. 
Well, you're going to have to use your imag ination. So  first of a ll, let's plot light as a 
function of depth. What does that look like? L ike that, exactly. It's going to decay 
exponentia lly. In lakes, this is about 10 m, and in oceans this  is about 100 m. 

Oh, and this was a question somebody gave in the instant feedback. Somebody said, 
I find it hard to believe that a ll life in the oceans disappears where there is no more 
light. And, you're absolutely right. It's only the photosynthetic life that disappears 
when there's no more light. There's lots of life below there that is using organic 
carbon. So, if you're here, that the answer to your question. 

OK, so  then, now we're going to plot temperature which looks something like this. 
And, this is what's ca lled the thermocline. And we can a lso think of this as density. 
Because colder water is more dense than warmer water, right, you must have 
learned that, did you learn that somewhere? D id you learn that somewhere? Where 
did you learn that? Fourth grade, great, well-prepared. So, up on the surface we 

have biosynthesis here where there's light, and so it's exactly the same reaction as 
we have over here. 

And now it gets to the terrestria l ecosystem. The production you have  in the surface 
water is you have phytoplankton photosynthesizing, making organic matter. They're 
being eaten by zooplankton, by fish that are making  feces, etc., that are being eaten 
by the detritivores. But the net effect of this teeming  food web you saw in the DVD 
last time, is that there's going to be organic carbon that falls down below this  lit 
zone. 

OK, and that was the wha le falling down make, no, not purposefully, but fa lling down 
and making carbon available to  the food web in the deep water. So down here, you 
have regeneration. So this  is light. And this is  in the dark in the system. But it's 
directly ana logous to the biosynthesis and  regeneration system there. So the other 
thing we want to plot on this is nutrients. They are drawn down to very low levels in 
the surface water in the lit layer because the phytop lankton are sucking them up. 

They are nutrient limited. They're sucking up the nitrogen, phosphorus, et cetera. 
And then, as the carbon and all of that range down to the deep water, it's 
regenerated, and then the nutrients are regenerated. So that's why you see the 
gradient of the low nutrients here and high nutrients here, because the bacteria in 
the deep water are breaking down the carbon and releasing them. 

OK, so  if we look at this map, we can see that for aquatic ecosystems, obviously 
water is not limiting. So water is an important regulator. Light is a very important 
regulator of productivity down to about  in this region. And nutrients, it turns out, are 
very important. And it's nutrients that rea lly determine the tapestry of this map that 
we're looking at. And what I'm going to do for the rest of the class is exp lain in lakes 
and oceans how the physical forces make these nutrients available in certain regions 
more than in other reg ions and expla in this. 

OK, so  first let's look at lake ecosystems. So, what we're show ing here is a year in 
the life of a temperate lake. So this might be the Mystic Lakes out in Arlington or 
something like that. Well, maybe that doesn't freeze over, I don't know. But anyway, 
a lake that freezes over in the w inter. So let's start during the summer, and here's 
this basic graph show ing the thermocline, the nutrient depletion in the surface, and 
this one ind icates that you actually have oxygen dep letion in the deep water because 
of all of this organic matter from productivity ra ining down and being consumed by 
heterotrophic organisms that consume oxygen. 

So, as fall comes, and this is the important part, in the summertime, this layer is 
mixed. So, it's  isotherma l. In the fa ll, you have the winds and the surface cools. And 
as this density gradient here starts to break down, do the cooling in the w inds. And 
so, you have this mixing. It's ca lled fa ll overturn, which entrains these nutrients from 
the deep water into the surface. 

So that's the way you get the nutrients for the deep water back up into  the surface, 
whereas in the summertime, the gradient is maintained because of this density 
barrier, and the mixing can't bring this down. And then in the w inter, you have the 
ice cover that obviously everything then is just isothermal. There's not much going 
on, but there is some photosynthesis. 

And then in the spring, the surface waters start to warm up, the ice melts, you have 
overturn, and brings the water up  from the deep water. In  lakes, this can mix a ll the 
way to the bottom, OK? In the oceans, there's no force of nature that can mix all the 
way down to 2,000 m. So you have this thermocline in the oceans, but it's in a 
relatively sma ll fraction of the tota l water column. 

So the sca le here is way off. We're going  from 100 m down to 2,000. So in the 
ocean, it's just this tiny little, all this action in the surface. So we need another 
mechanism. We can't mix all the way down to the deep ocean. So, we need another 
mechanism  for bringing nutrients to the surface. And we're going to talk about, 
there's four d ifferent ways. There's four different ways that the deep water nutrients 
are brought back up where there is  light, because you have to have light for 
photosynthesis to use the nutrients. 

And one is ep isodic mixing. I'm just going to list them, and then we're going to go 
through them: coastal upwelling -- -- equatorial upwelling, and on much longer time 
sca les, what's ca lled the "oceanic conveyor belt" in quotes, which is basically loca l 
ocean circulation. So let's go through these. In the oceans, ep isodic mixing, let's go 
back. Now, just pretend this is an ocean, and that this goes down to 2,000 m, and 
there's a thermocline. 

What happens in the oceans is that you just have little, episod ic mixing events that 
erode right here to get little bursts of nutrients injected into the lit area. That's 
seasonal mixing, but it never mixes all the way to the bottom. And we can see, I'll 
show you where, this right here is the north Atlantic's b loom. And in the springtime, 
you see major bloom there due to this episod ic mixing in the North Atlantic, which 
have high w inds and a  lot of mixing. 

OK, so  there are a lso ocean currents caused by this coastal upwelling phenomenon, 
especia lly along the western coasts of continents. And I don't have time to go into 
this. You need a whole course and physical oceanography to really understand this 
because it has to do with the whole g lobal ocean circulation that causes this 
upwelling along the coasts. But, I'm going to show you how this works  in this movie, 
or a little movie. 

I guess that's as dark as we're going to get. This is a cross-section of a coastal 
ocean. So, here's the coastline. Here's the surface of the ocean. And these little 
molecules here are CO2. Can you see blue? This is probab ly not going to work 
because of this filming. Well, we'll see what happens. OK, so I'm going to go through 
it in a still, and then I'll show the movie. But what you're going to see is a b lue patch 
upwelling along the coast here, and CO2 molecules are coming up with it. 

OK, here's the blue. That's nutrients, nitrogen, phosphorus, etc. The wind is b lowing 
offshore causing the surface waters to move in that d irection. They have to be 
replaced by something, so we're bringing the deep water up to replace that moving 
surface water. And as that comes up, the CO2 comes up and is released. And then 
you have a phytoplankton bloom  from the nutrients, and then the CO2 sucked back 
in aga in and you have oxygen going out. 

And, here it goes, the movie. Upwelling: The Movie. There comes the CO2. Here are 
the nutrients. CO2 out, CO2 back in. These are phytoplankton, these green blobs. 
That's a bloom. So you have now the phytop lankton falling, b ig b loom, organic 
carbon going down and being  regenerated. So, it's a very dynamic system and that's 

why you have a lot of high- intensity fisheries along the coasts, especia lly the western 
coast of continents because of this upwelling; there's lots of nutrients, lots of 
phytoplankton, lots of fish. 

A dramatic example of the power of the surface currents, and how  they affect 
upwelling is this phenomenon ca lled El N iÃ±o. I think I'll skip  the slide. You don't have 
it in hand out, anyway. But here's an animation show ing the changes in the 
productivity in the Pacific Ocean a long the equator. Here's an El NiÃ±o. And  I'll expla in 
how that works in a minute. 

Here's a normal year where you have these phytoplankton blooms, and let's look at 
it in this. You've seen this one before, but let's look at it more closely. There's the 
equatoria l b loom caused by upwelling a long the equator in a norma l year. And as we 
go around, this is like three years in the life of the globe. See, there is high 
productivity at the Amazon where the Amazon's emptying. 

Now, we are going to zoom in here, and this is a normal year. And that's an El NiÃ±o 
year. You see,  there's very little productivity, and is very little upwelling along the 
coasts here. And that El NiÃ±o in Spanish, what does it mean? It refers to the Christ 
Child because this happens around Christmastime roughly every seven years. And 
what happens in a phenomenon is it turned out that people have studied enough for 
years. 

It's a g lobal phenomenon in which the preva iling currents in the whole Pacific Ocean 
shift from going in this direction which causes the upwelling here to going in this 
direction, which brings warm water suppressing  the upwelling and reducing the 
nutrient input into the system. OK, so here's an El NiÃ±o year, and d irectly compared 
to non-El NiÃ±o year. And that's all due to physical forces chang ing the nutrient 
delivery. 

So here's equatorial upwelling, and then  finally on a global sca le, over very long 
periods of time, you can imagine that these upwelling events would not be enough to 
bring, you have this constant rain of organic matter coming  from the surface waters. 
And this nutrient reservoir in the deep waters, none of these upwelling events are 
enough to bring a ll that back and renew the system. 

So you need a bigger force than that on a globa l sca le over long time periods. And 
that's what's called the great oceanic conveyor belt. And this is really important, 
because I think peop le think of the oceans as a static, understandab ly, you look out 
there; it looks like a bunch of water with the surface waters and w ith the deep 
waters. And  if you throw something in the deep waters it's going to stay there and 
you don't have to worry about it anymore. 

A lot of people want to bury nuclear waste in the deep water. And the point is that 
that's not true. The oceans are all interconnected, and if I'm a water molecule, the 
average amount of time, and I'm traveling w ith the currents, over a thousand years, 
I w ill make this whole journey where I go along  the surface waters and then I get to 
the North Atlantic, and because the waters are cooled and there's very high winds in 
the North Atlantic, you have cold water and the high winds cause high evaporation. 

So you have saltier water, so, cold, saltier water up here sinks. And that actually is a 
force that drives this whole global circulation. And so, I'm cruising along here. I get 
here, and I sink. And then I go for this long journey down the bottom. And of course, 

it's much more complicated. This is grossly oversimplified. But I go this long journey 
to the bottom of the Atlantic in these deep ocean currents, and then somewhere 
along the line, I get brought up again through zones of upwelling here, or maybe I 
would meander up here and get brought up again. 

I'm just one atom on average. So,  through these g loba l ocean currents, the deep 
water eventua lly comes up to the surface, bringing those nutrients back. Where it 
comes in contact with the light and  the phytoplankton, and they photosynthesize and 
they take up the nutrients and they make organic carbonate, and it a ll settles down 
again to the bottom. So, it's a cycle. And if you didn't have that, the thing would run 
down. If you d idn't have the deep water coming up eventually coming up 
somewhere, the system would just run down and you'd have a big anoxic bottom of 
the ocean. 

And who knows what would happen? So, this is really important. OK, so  fina lly, I've 
talked about nutrients in genera l, but what nutrients are the most important? And, it 
turns out that there are some nutrients that are in much less supp ly that are 
required by the plants. And this is what's called, so, what nutrients are important? 
Now, of course, they're a ll important but some are more important  in regulation than 
others. 

And there's something ca lled the law of the minimum. And it states that the growth 
of a p lant w ill be limited -- -- by that element that is in least supp ly relative, this is 
the important part, to the requirements of the plant or the phytoplankton. When I 
say plant, it could be phytoplankton or a tree, or a p lant, or whatever. 

And this is the important part. So how we figure out what the requirements for 
elements are above p lants? You might grab it, harvested, grind  it up, and measure 
the ratio of the elements in that p lant. So,  for examp le, if you do that, for most 
plants you get something on the order of, at least for most phytop lankton, which are 
my preferred plant, you get the ratio of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, of 106 
atoms of carbon per 16 nitrogen per one of phosphorus. 

So this tells you in what ratio they need these elements in order to grow. So then 
you look in the environment and you ask, what are the ratios ava ilab le? So, say if 
the water has a ratio of, what's going to be the most limiting element in that system 
for that p lant? Exactly, nitrogen. And, alternatively, you could have something like 
this. And what would be limiting there? Phosphorus limits. 

And it turns out that in most aquatic ecosystems, for now we're going to say that 
nitrogen and phosphorus are the important limiting factors. And just to show you, 
again, that ecologists do experiments, here's an experimenta l lakes area in Ontario, 
where there are 22 d ifferent lakes set aside for research. And in this particular set of 
lakes, this is a control lake, and this is the experimental lake. 

They added phosphorus to the lake. And you can see the phytoplankton bloom by 
only add ing phosphorus. They d idn't add anything else. And that means that 
phosphorus was in least supp ly relative to the other nutrients. And the interesting 
thing that happened here was that when they added the phosphorus,  that makes 
phosphorus in great abundance relative to nitrogen. 

And what that did is make nitrogen the limiting factor. And when nitrogen is the 
limiting factor, what organisms might have an advantage? We talked about them. 

Yeah, there you go, nitrogen fixing organisms. So, if nitrogen is limiting, only 
organisms that can take it from the atmosphere can get more nitrogen than the 
other organisms. So they are favored. And what happens is you fertilize with 
phosphorus. 

You get blooms of nitrogen fixing organisms. It's really an interesting phenomenon. 
But nitrogen and phosphorus are, one or the other is limiting in  lakes. And in large 
areas of the oceans, nitrogen and phosphorus are a lso limiting, except we've learned 
recently that there are areas of the oceans where iron is actua lly a  limiting factor. 
And this was an experiment that was done by oceanographers. 

And there is Alaska just to get you oriented. This is the North Pacific where they 
went out w ith a boat and they made it a patch. They added iron just to a patch of 
ocean. And I can tell you about this. We were involved in some of these 
experiments. It started out w ith a 10 km x 10 km patch and showed that if you add 
iron you get a bloom of phytop lankton. 

And this is a satellite image of that phytoplankton bloom. And in the last lecture, I'm 
going to tell you all about those  iron fertilization experiments, and the implications 
for how we are going to use the oceans in the future. So, take-home messages: we'll 
talk about that next time. You can take them home, but I don't want to keep you 
over.
