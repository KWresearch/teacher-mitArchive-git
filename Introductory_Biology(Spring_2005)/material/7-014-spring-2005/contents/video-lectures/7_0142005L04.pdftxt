Transcript â€“ Lecture 4 

So the big issue that I was trying to take on yesterday, and this is of really 
fundamenta l importance to biology, is that you saw from that molecular composition 
of cells 80% water. Of the rest of it about 50% of what's there by mass is protein. 
Proteins do most of the rea lly interesting stuff in the cell. They're the ones that are 
able to cata lyze specific chemica l reactions with all this amazing chemistry that's 
needed for life to take place at physiolog ica l conditions. 

They are structural components of the cells. They are all kinds of amazing machines. 
I showed you the little flagellar motor that turns it, but that's just one of many, 
many nano machines that are necessary for life. They have exquisite specificity when 
you get sick and you get an immune response. You develop antibodies and other 
cells that are able to recognize exactly some piece of that virus or bacterium that has 
infected you and mount an immune response. 

But all of the things that are doing that are proteins. And the sort of, most of you I 
think know that, as we've sort of said that amino acids are just a chain, one amino 
acid joined to another amino acid to another amino acid and so on. And so the 
backbone, that peptide bond that I showed the other day is absolutely regular piece 
of backbone. 

And what gives the amino acids their character is the side cha in that hangs off. And 
you'll have different side chains hanging off depend ing on what the amino acid is. 
And you w ill not have to memorize all of those structures. But the important thing is 
that these various amino acids fit into chemica l categories that g ive them properties. 
They either have a plus charge and a negative charge, they're hydrophobic, they 
don't like to go w ith water, they are polar, they cannot interact w ith water and so on. 

And it's clear from a coup le of your comments, some of you are why are we going 
through a ll of this? Well, the reason we're going  through a ll of this is all amino acids 
look like this. It doesn't matter. They're going to be an enzyme, a part of a motor, a 
structural part of yourselves. They a ll consist of the same backbone made up of 
those 20 amino acids. And what gives these, makes the proteins so  important is the 
ultimate 3-dimensiona l structure. 

I'm not sure what this sound is. OK. Let's try standing back here. What gives a ll of 
these proteins their ind ividua l character is how this cha in of amino acids, you could 
just think of them like this, folds up into some 3-dimensional structure that 
ultimately is able to do the b iological function that we're trying to understand. And 
one of the real holy grails still in b iology  is how to look at the sequence of amino 
acids that constitute a protein and figure out what the 3-dimensional structure is. 

It's one of the holy grails that hasn't been solved. One of you may have a key insight 
that will solve this. If we could do that it would  really be a huge advance, because 
what you can get out of the genome sequences is you can read the sequence of 
every gene and you can pred ict the sequence of amino acids in the protein. But all it 
tells you is the linear sequence of the amino acids. 

It doesn't tell you what the 3-dimensional structure is. And how an amino acid gets 
from the sort of floppy cha in linear structure to the 3-d imensiona l thing is 
complicated. And you have to understand several kinds of forces. And so I 
introduced a few terms. When we think about protein structure,  the primary 
structure,  that's just the linear sequence -- -- of amino acids. So valine followed by a 
tryptophan,  followed by a proline, followed a threonine, whatever it would be. 

That doesn't tell you very much. Then the first key part of understand ing how 
proteins get to a 3-dimensional structure was the d iscovery of what's termed 
secondary structure. And these are the thing I  introduced to you to the other day. 
There are two important ones. An a lpha helix and a beta sheet. And this is a 
propensity of a certain string of amino acids in this  linear sequence to adopt one of 
two very common protein structures. 

And the important thing about these elements, the alpha helices and the beta sheets 
is they are not dependent on the side chain. So  they are not. They are instead 
dependent on hydrogen bonds -- -- between N-H and the carbon double bond 
oxygen in the backbone. And that was how Linus Pauling figured out orig ina lly the 
alpha helix. He decided to ignore all the side cha ins. And he worked out that you 
could arrange the backbone of a protein, the peptide bonds  into these repeating 
structures that would account for the reflections he'd seen. 

When we get to  talking about how Watson and Crick worked out the structure, that's 
how they started out, too. They decided to ignore, if you w ill, the side cha ins, which 
are the As and Gs and Cs and Ts, which turned out to be not a productive way to go 
after the structure of DNA. But, in any case, that was part of what Linus Pauling d id 
in working these out. And so those little movies I showed you, this is an alpha helix. 

Now, what's been done in this p icture is a ll the side chains have been taken off. And 
so you can look at this in your textbook, you'll see p ictures, but these hydrogen 
bonds are -- The amino acid is just in this helix. It's coiling around. And at regular 
interva ls there's the opportunity for forming a hydrogen bond. And we can, with 
some success but certa inly not certa inty, predict that a particular sequence of amino 
acids is going to form an a lpha helix. 

And part of what that's based on is there are some amino acids that don't fit easily 
into an a lpha helix, so they'll disrupt one if it ever tried to form. So that's one of the 
elements of protein structure. So what you might get from this is the idea that 
somewhere along here this little p iece of the linear sequence is apt to be an a lpha 
helix. And you can represent that as this little sort of coil that you see in these 3-
dimensional structures. 

The other one, which is the beta sheet, now that involves interactions between two 
pieces of, two stretches of amino acids. Maybe there was a loop in between. And 
then you can get  interactions between them. And that, oops. Let me just go, there's 
the beta sheet interaction. Now, those are represented as arrows. You know, it takes 
two of them to go. So you've got to have, to represent a beta sheet in a 3-
dimensional structure you have to have two of those broad arrows. 

And there was a question why were there arrows on them? Well, one of the things, I 
think you can see if you look at those backbones, is that both nucleic acid and 
protein backbones, there's a polarity. If you start in this direction, the amino 

terminus, it's got a particular direction. It's not symmetric. If you come back the 
other way you find carboxyl, amino, the alpha carbon. 

And you'll find it in the opposite order if you come back the other way. So there's an 
inherent polarity. The arrows aren't represented on here, but they are when you look 
at it in 3-dimensions. And you can either form beta sheets where the two strands 
have the same polarity or, if in a case like that where they loop back, then of course 
if this one was pointing in this direction as it goes through the loop then the opposite 
strand will be pointing in the other polarity, one going this way and one going that 
way. 

So this part is sort of helpful. You can make guesses that maybe this part has a 
tendency over here to form a beta sheet, but you still haven't gotten very far 
towards understanding how you get to the 3-d imensional structure. And just by 
putting on and superimposing some amino acids onto that alpha helix then you can 
see what happens, that if you  form an alpha helix what happens is a ll the side chains 
stick out. 

And now I think you can see, those of you who are eng ineers anyway, if you wanted 
to build something you have a cylinder and you can stick amino acids out that have 
particular chemica l characteristics. And depend ing on the characteristics of those 
amino acids, whether they have charges on them or if they hate water or something, 
that will influence what happens to that component of the protein structure when it 
gets into a 3-dimensional thing. 

And, as I think I showed you the other day, when we caught it looking down the end 
on this particular examp le, here are a coup le of aromatic amino acids right here, 
they're on the same side of the helix and they would hate water. Whereas, some of 
the other amino acids up here are ones that have charges so  those would  love water. 
So what this would look like is a cylinder part of which hated water and part of which 
loved water. 

And you might guess it folded up in 3-dimensional space. The part that hated water 
might fold towards the inside of the protein. And the part of the cylinder that loved 
water would face to the outside. So that's sort of the underlying principle. So the rest 
of the other forces that we had to understand in order to get to what's called the 
tertiary structure,  this is the full 3D structure, which we can now determine by a 
variety of methods. 

X-ray crystallography of proteins is probab ly the most common. The NMR , for 
example, can be used to derive a 3-d imensiona l structure as well. And the other 
forces then that go into this are ionic forces. Someone seemed confused by this, but 
if you have a plus charge on this part of an amino acid and a minus charge here, if in 
3-dimensiona l space the p lus charge got somewhere near the minus charge then 
that would form an ionic bond. 

And I think most of you know enough electricity and magnetism that wouldn't 
surprise you that those two would be attracted. The one that I think that has been 
harder to understand  is van der Waals interactions that we talked about the other 
day, which is tricky  in the sense that for this course you don't particularly really need 
to understand the underlying chemistry. 

But the principal of it is that if you have a nonpolar bond, one that hasn't got any 
particular attraction to it, gets very, very close to another one, then the transient 
fluctuations in one induce something in the other one that makes them stick 
together. And  the whole point about this is  if you get two molecular surfaces that are 
very, very close together, about, you know, many two  times the length of a covalent 
bond or something, then you can generate very powerful forces. 

Because even though each individua l interaction is weak, about a quarter or a third 
of a hydrogen bond, summing them up can make them very, very strong. And so 
that's another kind of force that's important when a linear molecule is trying to figure 
out how  in space it's going to fold up. The point of the gecko thing was it's only 
relatively recently been d iscovered that the reason those lizards can stick to wa lls is 
they have sort of incredib le split ends. 

I noticed a couple of you came to Bob Full's talk the other day and you got to hear 
the full treatment. But because the hairs on their feet are so sp lit they're very fine 
and the molecules are ab le to make very close interactions, van der Waa ls 
interactions w ith the surface. And that's what's holding the gecko to  the wa ll. And 
there are just so many of them that it can support a whole gecko. 

And that's what could be the basis of, he said to me, a $30 to $50 billion adhesive 
industry, a self-cleaning dry adhesive. And it's not something mag ic only the gecko 
hair w ill do. You can design synthetic molecules that have the same property and are 
able to make these millions of van der Waals interactions. So that's two of the other 
things. 

And the fina l thing, which isn't really a force but goes into this, is this hydrophobic 
effect. And that is that if we have things, amino acids such as va line or something 
that doesn't like to mix with water, then when the protein folds up, the things that 
don't like to interact with water will kind of go together just the way if you put a lot 
of oil in the water it w ill sort of pull together. 

Because any time you have something that gets stuck  in water, it disrupts hydrogen 
bonds and that's energetically unfavorable. So the things that hate water will tend to 
lump together. And you're all used to seeing little drops of oil and stuff floating 
around. And let me sw itch over to this other thing now. So this was just showing you 
one of these protein cha ins that's folded up into a 3-dimensional structure. 

This happens to be something with an enzymatic activity. But the  important thing for 
right now is what's been colored in here are the amino acids that if you look back on 
the list of amino acids and what categories are, you'd see some of them are sa id to 
have hydrophob ic side chains. You can see quite striking ly how the amino acids in 
the interior part of this protein have clustered together. 

They don't like to interact with water. They interact very well with each other. Just 
like you can mix butter and oil, they mix together very well. And so that is another 
factor that contributes to the 3-d imensiona l structure of these proteins. So 
understanding what proteins are a ll about means ultimately understand ing their 3-
dimensional structure. And, as I say, a b ig unsolved problem right at the moment is 
how do you get from a linear cha in of amino acids to one of these 3-dimensiona l 
structures? And you can imagine with 20 d ifferent side cha ins there's an unbelievable 
number of combinations that you can make. 

Yet almost every protein in nature has one unique or one or two or something 
confirmations that takes out, out of all the kinds of things that you could do. And it's 
this combination of forces that does that. You know, let me just go back for one 
second. So the final thing that ones ta lks about when you're ta lking about proteins 
are quaternary structure. And what that means  is when you have more than one 
polypeptide cha in, so if we have two different proteins that interact, this is protein 
number one and this  is protein number two, then there has to be some sort of 
interaction between each of these three d imensional structures in order for the 
proteins to stick together. 

Something like that flagellar motor that  let's the bacteria sw im, has many, many 
parts, all of which have to fit together just the same way a ll the d ifferent parts of an 
eng ine have to fit together. Now this next little movie is just a d imer. It's actually a 
heterod imer so it's made of two proteins. They're d ifferent but they've come 
together and they're interaction. 

So what you will first see is the 3-dimensional structure of each protein show ing the 
alpha helices, the beta sheets, and nothing else is shown. The side chains aren't 
shown. The molecular surfaces aren't shown. You can just see the backbone. You'll 
see alpha helix a turn, some beta sheets, just the kind of stuff you were seeing the 
other day. But you'll see that the two proteins are together. 

And this is actua lly a movie made by Tom Schwartz who 's a crystallogram who just 
started on our facility this fall in the biology department. It's one of the proteins he 
stud ied. And then after that he rotates it around so you can see it. After that he then 
puts on the side cha ins and then traces the surface. So this is what they ca ll the van 
der Waa ls surface. So this is what the protein would actua lly look like. 

And what I think you'll see from this is how incredib ly well the proteins fit together. 
The theme I'll probab ly keep saying all the way through the course is b iology works 
from  fitting shapes. And things have to work incredibly well, and that's also why 
these van der Waals forces become so important. Because evolution has ended up 
making things that just go together just like a hand in a perfectly fit glove. 

That's the way most of these interactions are. So watch this little movie. So the light 
blue is one of the proteins. There's an alpha helix. There are a lot of alpha helices in 
this one. And the purple one is the other protein. And you can see that in between 
them there's an interface. And so those must be interacting. But when he 
superimposes now a ll the amino acids in the surface, now what he's going to do, he's 
going to pull those apart so you can see where they were interacting. 

Do you get the idea now of how beautifully these things have folded up in 3-
dimensional space in positions so  that they can fit together and work together as a 
machine? Just the same way if you were building a machine and you needed to have 
two parts that you had to join together you've got a tool thing so that the surfaces 
go exactly together. That's what nature does. 

That's also why I'm making such a deal out of this 3-dimensioanl structure of 
proteins and how it got there. I could just say it gets there by mag ic, but it doesn't. 
It's determined by this set of forces. And one of the things we cannot do at this point 
is pred ict. Here's a linear sequence of amino acids. Here's the 3D structure. That 
would be a huge advance in biology if one of you guys could figure out how to do 
that during your career. 

OK. So I just want to reiterate some of the things that proteins do because we'll be 
talking about them as we go a long. One thing they do, they act as enzymes which 
are cata lysts for b iological reactions that take place under physiolog ica l conditions. 
And we'll give you a lot of examples of those enzymes starting very soon. They play 
structural roles. 

Our hair, our fingerna ils are made of protein. The hairs on the gecko 's feet are made 
of keratin which is the same stuff our hair is made of, except they basically got a 
whole lot of split ends. They're finer ha irs to beg in with and a lot of split ends. And 
that's what makes these very, very fine things that can make van der Waals 
interactions w ith surfaces. They play roles in specificity. 

For example, I mentioned the antibod ies. And we'll talk about the immune response 
in some detail at the end of the course. And one of the rea lly magic things that we've 
come to understand in b iology recently is how it is that your body has this immune 
system that's ab le to recognize  literally any molecule, any molecule. It doesn't 
matter whether it is existed or you and your PhD thesis in chemistry synthesize 
something the world has never seen before, your immune system can create an 
antibody or something that will very, very specifica lly recognize that particular shape 
in just the same sort of way that you saw the shape on that movie. 

And you might think you'd need to code a zillion millions of DNA in order to do that. 
But there's a trick using combinatorial functions and mutation that lets your body do 
that. Another examp le, which I was showing you, that can do all sorts of little motors 
and machines, I showed you the bacteria swimming around. These are just E. coli. 
And you cannot see the flagellar motors, but you can see them buzzing around just 
under a cover slip. 

Some of them are stuck to the cover slip. There we go. In this one, which was taken 
by Howard Burge who is a professor at Harvard, I just took this off his website, you 
can see the bacteria swimming by having these flagella which are basica lly like sort 
of propellers more or less that they turn. Here's one where he used the strobe so you 
can get a little bit better view of it. And I showed you this p icture in the first lecture. 

So that's the machine, but every single part of that machine is made of a protein 
that's got a very certain 3-dimensional space. And we're going to start talking about 
energetics, how does this cell get energy? And one of the things you might wonder is 
if you were to design such a nano machine how would you power it? They exist. I 
mean it's here. 

But that's why in part I'm going to start talking about energy and how cells make 
energy, because this is one of the things they have to do. And that was, as I said, 
was an average electron micrograph of a lot of those motors. So you can see that 
although, you know,  that's the textbook thing, the actua l thing is pretty much the 
same shape. This is not at a resolution where you can make out the ind ividual 
proteins that put it together, but some of those are starting to be known in 3-
dimensional deta il. 

And I thought you might enjoy seeing this just to convince you it's a motor. In this 
thing, what Howard Burge did was he stuck the propeller, if you will, the flagellar to 
a cover slip using an antibody. And then he let them do their thing. And norma lly 
they would be turning the propeller and sw imming, but if the propeller is attached 

the same thing would happen if you held onto the propeller of a boat and turned on 
the motor the boat would start twirling around. 

And what you're seeing here is bacterial that are tw irling around because their 
flagellar are stuck on. And those of you who are observant w ill notice even that they 
change direction. And that's part of the system that bacteria use so they can swim 
towards a food source or away from another one. OK. Here's just something to let 
you think about it. If anybody can figure this out send me an email. 

Here's something else. The phenomenon I'm going to show you is due to a protein 
made by a soil bacterium called Pseudomonas syringae. You don't need to know that. 
It associated w ith p lants. And what you're going to see is a little movie made by a 
coup le of post-docs in my lab where they took pure water. And if it's pure water you 
can cool  it below freezing. 

You can get it down to, I don't know, minus eight degrees centigrade and it still w ill 
be a  liquid, even though you know water freezes at zero degrees centigrade. And 
what it has to do in order to turn into ice, somewhere you have to nucleate the 
formation of an ice crystal. And once it goes, going. So, anyway, what you're going 
to see is some super- cooled water they've made. 

You can see there is zero degrees there. And this is Metchitaga, one of the post-docs 
in my lab. That's the super-cooled water. She's taking a little bit of culture of this 
Pseudomonas syringae, and she's just going to put it in, g ive a little tiny squirt, a  few 
micro-liters into that water. Now it's going all cloudy. And now you might wonder 
what's happening there. But, as you'll discovery, what happened  is that what was 
liquid water is now ice. 

That  is due to one protein that this bacterium makes and displays on its surface. And 
here's a controlled experiment. This is putting in a little bit of rhizobium meliloti, 
another soil organism, and the same amount of bacteria. It didn't happen. OK. So 
that's due to a protein that was on the surface of that bacterium. Anybody have any 
idea what that could do? Send me an email. OK. There's one last class of biolog ica l 
macromolecule. 

Those are lipids. These are a little different in the sense that this is not know a  long 
cha in made by joining together subunits as you see w ith the proteins and nucleic 
acids, but putting together the parts necessary to make a lip id involve the same 
principle, that you end up splitting out water molecules. That's a theme you've heard 
over and over aga in. And if we take three long chain, three fatty acids, some number 
of carbons -- Some number of carbons. 

Just some arbitrary number here. And then we take a three carbon compound that 
has three hydroxyl groups. Now, this is not a carbohydrate because you'll notice 
there's not a double bond oxygen as you saw in the carbohydrates. It's actually an 
alcohol that's known as glycerol. And if we split out water like this what you get is a 
fat, something you're familiar w ith  from beef fat. Or if you get something like olive 
oil, you've heard the term unsaturated fats. 

Maybe you'll recall from the second lecture that if we had a sing le covalent bond, or 
if we had a double or a trip le bond that was called an unsaturated bond. So  if you 
have an unsaturated bond in here somewhere then you end up with an unsaturated 

fat. And most of you know probab ly something like beef fat is solid. If you put it in a 
refrigerator something like peanut oil w ill stay liquid. 

And that's because if you have just saturated side chains from this then they pack 
together very tightly and they w ill form a solid. If you put a doub le bond in then 
there's a kink in the backbone and it's hard for these things to pack together. And 
that's why they're called unsaturated  fats. Now,  there's a very particular kind of  lipid 
that's of unbelievab le importance in b iology known as a phospholipid. 

And the reason that's so important is that that is the boundary that determines the 
outside of a cell. So every cell, every organism either is a sing le cell or is made up of 
multip le cells. And, as I said in the first  lecture, that one of the secrets to life is 
having a boundary that goes around your insides it separates your insides from a ll 
the rest of the universe. 

And the way these membranes, as they're called, are made of is what's known as a 
phospholipid bilayer. And it's the same principle as before. It uses a glycerol, except 
that one of the fatty acids is rep laced by a phosphate group that w ill have some kind 
decoration added onto it. And the other will have fatty acids at the other two 
positions. Now, you'll notice by sp litting out water here, the kind of bond that we 
have created, the chemical name of this is an ester bond. 

And if we wanted to break it we could add water back across it. So what's important 
about this molecule is this part of the molecule, if you will, is water-loving because 
the very polar bonds here, the oxygen here would have a negative charge under 
physiolog ica l conditions. And this part is, if you will, water-hating. So phospholipids 
are often represented in the follow ing way where this is the water- loving and then 
this would be the water-hating part here. 

And so  if you take phospholipids and you just try and d isperse them in water, they 
spontaneously self-assemb le into structures that bring the water-loving parts 
together and the water-hating parts together. And by so doing this they form what's 
known as a phospholip id b ilayer. And that's what this membrane is made of. 
Membrane of bacterial cell, membrane of our cells virtua lly the same thing. It has 
the property that is not permeable to very much. 

Water can get across a very limited number of other chemical compounds, but most 
things cannot. And so, by having this membrane, what the cell is ab le to do then  is 
control who comes in and who comes out. And the way it does that is it has to put 
particular importers or exporters imbedded in the membrane that can carry out 
those functions. Because, as you would guess, any system would have to bring stuff 
in, get rid of waste, you'd have to be able to go back and  forth. 

The things that do a ll those transports across the membrane are, what kind of 
molecule do you think it likely to be? If nature was going to design something that 
was a pump to get something in or something that would get something out, any 
idea what kind of molecule? Take a guess g iven what I've sa id so far. Protein. Yeah. 
Absolutely. And let me just sort of show you a couple little pictures here. 

So here's a representation of this phospholipid b ilayer. This is pretty standard stuff. 
This is what you'd put on a blackboard. Here's in gray now the phospholip id. And 
here's one of these proteins, a picture of one of these proteins that functions to get 
things across the membrane. And hopefully what you can see now  is that it's made 

up of a whole lot of a lpha helices, and they pack together to g ive sort of a cylinder 
made up of different alpha helices that weave in out like this. 

And then by this sort of trick the protein is able to create a channel that runs up and 
down the middle of this protein that's imbedded  in the membrane. And then, 
depending on the characteristics that channel, it can either be used to bring stuff in 
or get rid of it. There is a more fanciful dep iction of it. This is not reality, but there 
you are w ith the water-loving parts. 

Here are the fatty acids going in. And this is supposed to be one of these membrane 
proteins. Now, this next movie is trying to pretend here that it's looking at one of 
these membrane proteins colored here in red as it spans the membrane. So here's 
looking  from the membrane surface on. And now it's going to d ive into this thing as 
it crossed  the membrane. 

And basica lly what this movie is letting you do is feel like if you were the molecule 
that's being transported across the membrane you'd see how you'd go right down 
through a channel in the midd le of the protein. So that's one of the underlying 
principals then, is that you have a phospholipid boundary that's critica l for life. But 
then to have everything else that needs to happen the cell makes a series of proteins 
that function either to bring stuff in or to bring it out. 

Or in the case of something like the flagellar motor we ta lked about it has to imbed a 
part of the machinery right in the membrane. And one  last p icture I just want to 
show you. Usually, even on that movie, you tend to see the cell represented 
something like this w ith a membrane and every once in a while there's a protein. 
This is a cartoon but it is much closer to a to-scale drawing. 

This is an E. coli cell. Now, they have an extra membrane that we won't worry about 
right for the moment. But right there, this little piece that we can see little bits of, is 
the cell's membrane. And what this p icture is showing is that this membrane is just 
absolutely studded with membrane proteins that are going to carry out various 
functions. And here actua lly we're seeing that motor which is imbedded both in the 
inner and outer membrane. 

And there's the motor going off. But a coup le of things maybe you can take home 
from this is there are a lot of proteins stuck in those membranes that control what 
goes in and out. You also get a sense in here of how crowded the cytoplasm is. The 
proteins are rea lly at amazingly high concentrations when they're inside the 
cytoplasm. OK. So that's sort of a quick survey. 

It's nothing more that a  really superficial introduction to the four classes of 
biomolecules. But to go any farther we're going  to have to think a little b it now about 
of the characteristics of living cells. I don't know if any of you know if any of you 
know what this  is, but this is bakers yeast. If you were making bread you know you 
put some yeast in it and it divides and it gives off carbon dioxide as a waste product 
and makes the bread  rise. 

And what's happened in that  little movie you just saw were two cells divid ing to give 
four, and  four dividing to get eight, and I don't know what we're up to here, but you 
can see a cell grow. That's sped up. It takes probably something closer to an hour 
for a cell division to take place. But this  is the kind of thing that microorganisms do 

when they grow,  is you can start with a single cell and it will make two cells that are 
identica l to itself and those will make four. 

And what happens when we start out as a single cell, we start out  initia lly like this. 
And we make cells that are identical at the beginning. And those are the famous 
embryonic stem cells, because at this point they can become any cell in your body. 
And if you're a yeast it doesn't matter. Everything you make is the same. If it's a 
human, once you start d ividing at some point cells are going to have to start making 
decisions and the progeny will have to start to be d ifferent of each other so that you 
can have something that's an eye and another cell that's  in the liver and so on. 

And we'll ta lk a little b it about that as we go on. But the major point, right at this 
point, is that all of life involves one cell d ividing and giving a coup le of other cells, 
and then those going on. So these cells, as we've sa id, characteristics of organisms 
which are to be true at their cellular level as well is that they carry out metabolism, 
they undergo regulated growth. 

And you have a nice example of yeast undergoing regulated growth and they 
reproduce, which in the case of a sing le-celled organism is the same as cell division. 
For us reproducing is a lot more comp licated because we have to make a whole other 
multicellular organism where the cells have d ifferentiated functions, but the point 
about that is there has to be an unbelievable amount of synthesis. 

The DNA in our body, we start out w ith two meters in a  fertilized cell, and we have 
ten to the fourteenth cells by the time we're an adult. So we've had to make a 
tremendous amount of DNA let alone protein and everything else. And something 
almost all of you know  from your engineering background from this p lace is that you 
need energy in order to synthesize materia l. 

And what we'll start to ta lk about in the next phase of this course then is how do 
cells make energy and how do they carry out metabolism. So I'm going to, just 
before we do that, introduce to you very quickly, to close out here, two classes of 
organisms that we find in nature. We find organisms that are known as autotrophs. 
These are certain bacteria, and they're able to make everything they need starting 
with CO2, ammonia, phosphate, water, a few things, but that's all they need. 

So, for example, an organism that lives, a bacterium that lives out in the open ocean 
is able to make everything from those very, very simple basic build ing blocks. 
Heterotrophs need to eat -- -- some things made by other organisms. An example of 
a heterotroph that you're familiar w ith, that I'm  familiar with is us. You probab ly 
remember your mother remind ing you, as you're about to have yet another hotdog, 
that it was important to eat your vitamins. 

The reason you need to eat vitamins, those are things we absolutely need for our life 
but we cannot make them ourselves. Vitamin C is one you probab ly know. It has an 
interesting history how people figured this out. It was sa ilors at sea got really, really 
sick. Their teeth would start to loosen, they would start to b leed and they would die. 
Some of the famous sea voyages you heard about in high school, I think the Cape of 
Good Hope, on that trip where that was discovered 100 out of the 160 sailors d ied at 
sea because of scurvy. 

Now, scurvy turns out to be due to not having vitamin C. And there was fina lly a 
guy, Lind, I'm just blanking on his first name at the moment, in about the 1700s who 

was a nava l surgeon in the British Navy who actually figured out that if you gave 
sailors lemon juice that they d idn't get scurvy. It was a controlled experiment. It 
took about 50 years. I think it was 1795 when they started to finally g ive the sailors 
lemon juice and stopped having this terrib le sickness amongst their sa ilors. 

And then in about 1950 they substituted lime juice. And some of you may still know 
the British sa ilors are called "limeys". And that was because of this solution they 
found to avoiding scurvy. And what was rea lly happening was they were find ing a 
way to provide vitamin C which  is in fresh fruits and vegetables which wasn't part of 
the classic sa ilor diet which was sort of biscuits and dried meat during long voyages 
at sea. 

And there are severa l other vitamins, but the reason they're ca lled vitamins is 
they're things that you body cannot make but other organisms can. The other thing 
that we cannot make, we can make some of our 20 amino acids, but there are eight 
amino acids that we cannot make, lysine, methionine, lucien, isoleucine, valine, 
threonine, phenylalanine and tryptophan. And this actually has consequences for us 
because those of you who are vegetarians probably know you have to be kind of 
careful about your diet. 

If you're eating animal protein you're getting essentially all the different amino acids, 
but if you're a vegetarian you have to be careful because the major food crops such 
as wheat and rice, for example, are very low in lysine. So if you just eat those you 
end up with a lysine deficiency that's not good. But, on the other hand, beans, 
lentils, the various leguminous p lants, which also are those ones that form the 
special associations with bacteria that let them convert atmospheric nitrogen into 
ammonia, legumes are high in lysine but  low in methionine. 

So peop les all over the world figured this out by tria l and error. So the Mexican diet 
is rice and beans. There's a reason  for it. What's happening actually is just in the rice 
you're low in lysine, but by having beans at the same time you're ba lancing out the 
two. Or the Native Americans in this pat of the country had "the three sisters" w ith 
the corn, the squash and the beans. 

And aga in they were balancing out the diet by making sure that they got the various 
amino acids, a balance of a ll the amino acids that were necessary for life. It also 
actually was really good gardening practice because the beans were ab le to convert 
atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, which was fertilizer, and the squash leaves 
shaded the ground so that the ground d idn't dry out, and the corn could grow even 
when it was short on water. 

But what was really happening, as peop le grew without even understanding about 
chemistry, they were compensating for the fact that we're heterotrophs and needed 
to do this. So we'll start in the next lecture on trying to talk about how cells make 
energy and how it makes some of this amazing stuff happen.
