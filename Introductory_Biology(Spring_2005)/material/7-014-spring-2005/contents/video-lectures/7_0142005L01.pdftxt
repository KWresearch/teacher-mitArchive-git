7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 1 

I am a professor in the Biology Department at MIT. And I will be co-teaching this 
course w ith Penny Chisholm who is a professor in the Department of Civil and 
Environmenta l Eng ineering, as well as a professor in the Biology Department. As 
well, Penny was recently featured  in the journal Nature. She is a very well-known 
oceanographer who has become deserved ly famous for d iscovering a very small 
bacterium that's capab le of carrying out photosynthesis. For many years 
oceanographers used  filters whose holes were b ig enough that this bacterium went 
through. 

And so when they were doing their studies of the ocean and how the biomass that 
was there and a ll the fluxes and so on, they d idn't know this organism existed which 
can form up to 50% of the b iomass in parts of the ocean. So Penny is really a 
wonderful lecturer, a wonderful person, and she'll be teaching the component of 
7.014 which dea ls with ecology and the environment. And this is a section of 7.014 
that makes it different from  the other two versions, 7.012 and 7.013. So  for me 
personally this is an absolutely wonderful and exciting opportunity to be able to 
teach this Introductory Biology course. For some of you I know that biology is going 
to either be a major part of your career or quite possibly, even if you're in 
eng ineering or something else, you will find yourselves working with a b iological 
system. 

You can see that happening a ll over campus these days that more and more 
eng ineering departments are finding that they're working on problems that come 
from biology or have a b iological component. I'm sure there are at least a few of you 
here who are only here because it's a  required course and you might well w ish you 
were somewhere else. However, I w ill do my best to  try to communicate to you why 
you need to know some biology, too. 

I think most of you know you can hardly pick up a newspaper these days w ithout 
running into something that demands a knowledge of biology, something about stem 
cells, something about cloning humans, something about a new drug,  lots of things 
having to do with biologica l affects on the environment and so on. You're also going 
to be confronted w ith decisions about your health, about the hea lth of your loved 
ones concerning cancer, concerning whether a child might have birth defects, a ll sort 
of issues that will affect your persona l lives that demand an understanding of 
biology. 

So I feel with some passion that whether you think you're going to need biology in 
your professional career or not, everyone in this institution needs some 
understanding of biology to just live their ordinary  lives. I a lso think as MIT students 
you're going to be  looked at, as you go through your lives, as people who are 
know ledgeab le about science and eng ineering. And you'll be asked questions that go 
far beyond your immediate area of expertise. And again I think that's another reason 
for need ing to know some of biology. 

Anyway, it's an absolutely wonderful time to teach biology because things have just 
been exploding over the last two or three decades and things are moving faster than 
ever. And another wonderful thing about teaching biology is that MIT is an absolutely 
marvelous p lace to teach  it. Just to sort of drive this home, in the Biology 
Department alone there are four Nobel laureates who got honored for critica l 
discoveries in b iology. Gobin Khorana who is just down the hall from me synthesized 
the first gene. It was an extraord inary feat of synthesis of organic chemistry 
synthesiz ing DNA. When I was an undergrad  I was a chemistry major but I had to 
take an introductory biology course. And at that point the DNA wasn't mentioned in 
the high school course. 

So the first time that I heard about DNA was in my introductory biology course. And 
that determined by career d irection. I thought that was such an interesting molecule 
that I wanted to work on it and I talked myself into one of the labs in Ottawa, 
Canada where I grew up that was trying to synthesize DNA, synthesize pieces of the 
gene. And, as it turned out later, competing unsuccessfully w ith my now colleague 
Gobin Khorana. Susumu Tonegawa got a Nobel prize for discovering the amaz ing 
molecular operations that underlie the d iversity of the immune system. 

Your immune system has the capacity to recognize viruses and bacteria, all sorts of 
different pathogens, includ ing molecules. It can recognize molecules that haven't 
even ever been synthesized in the history of life. And we'll ta lk towards the end of 
the course about the way that happens. And you'll see why Susumu got his Nobel 
prize. Phil Sharp got his for discovering RNA sp licing completely unanticipated 
component of the very heart of molecular b iology. And then Bob Horvitz who was of 
pure mind when he started at MIT at the same time and our labs were side by side 
for many years, got his Nobel prize in 2002 for discovering a phenomenon, the 
general term is "programmed" cell death. And it plays a ll sorts of important roles in 
biology from sculpting the shapes of organs and tissues. 

We initially have webs when we're develop ing between our fingers, and those go 
away because of the programmed cell death that the cells that were making the web 
disappear. And another role of that is prevent cancer. That if cells sense that 
something is very messed up they have a sort of suicide program that would make 
them destroy themselves. And if that doesn't happen those cells could go on and 
become more and more abnormal and eventua lly turn into an invasive cancer. 

Anyway, there's a p icture of Bob when the  institute was celebrating his Nobel prize. 
He was getting a congratulatory kiss from Martha Constantine-Paton, also a 
professor in the Biology Department who happens to be Bob's wife. Most of you 
know that the human genome has now been sequenced. That was one of the huge 
undertakings and most important undertakings in modern b iology over the last 
while. It was an incred ible feat. Each cell has, as most of you know, 46 
chromosomes. And that's a total of about two meters of DNA  in every human cell. 
And that two meters of DNA is composed of about 3 million DNA base pairs, these 
letters A, T, G and C that we'll be talking about as we go through the course. 

So to sequence the genome you had to work out the sequence of the exact run of 
these A, G, T and Cs along the backbone for 3 billion base pairs. And somewhere 
that genome encodes somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 genes. And we'll be 
talking about the proteins that are encoded by most of those genes and their 
important roles as we go on in the course. What some of you may not know is the 
key role that MIT played in this. About a third of the genome was sequenced at the 

Whitehead MIT Genome Center. And here are some of the robots that were used to 
sequence that DNA. And that sequencing effort was led by Eric Lander whose name 
some of you may recognize because he teaches the fall version of 7. 

012 a long with Bob Weinberg. So here are just a few examples of why I think it's 
important for you to understand biology regardless of whether you're going to go on 
and use it professionally. Most of you know one of the biggest challenges we face on 
this planet is this AIDS epidemic. It's caused by a certa in kind of virus called HIV-1 
that gets into particular cells of your immune system  that normally defends us 
against infection and destroys those. 

And then people die from infections by other organisms that norma lly you can  fight 
off. It's a huge problem w ith vast societal and economic implications. And it's one 
that we're still, as a mankind still trying to deal with and grapple with. Here's 
another example. Just a couple of years ago there was the scar of anthrax. It's a 
bacterium that's very pathogenic and kills its host fa irly easily. It does it by making 
particular toxins. The details shown here don't matter, but just reminding you that 
this is something that was in the front pages of the paper just a little while ago. A 
coup le of years ago, when I was teaching this, we had the scare of the SARS virus 
that went a ll the way during the course when I was teaching it from the initial 
discovery of the virus to the actua l sequencing of the genome which had happened 
by later on in this course. 

Smallpox was a disease we thought that we eliminated, but now  it's come back as a 
bioterrorism treat and there is increased study of smallpox. It's something we have 
to worry about aga in. 

Here's another example. This is a p icture showing the start of a transgenic animal. 
We'll ta lk about how this process goes later in the course. And it's related also to this 
whole issue of cloning, using the sense of the word such as in trying to clone a 
human or clone an animal to make a genetically identical copy. So you'll see there 
are a coup le of different uses of the word cloning as we go through the course. 
There's a lot of fuss  in the news and the newspapers about genetica lly modified  food, 
and people have d ifferent positions on it. 

Here's a case where I think the benefit of a genetica lly mod ified food could hardly be 
argued with. About two-thirds of the world's population uses rice as their primary 
source of food. One of the prob lems w ith rice is that it doesn't make beta-carotene. 
And beta carotene is what our bodies take and use to make vitamin A. And if you 
have a vitamin A deficiency people are prone to infection. They have immune 
deficiencies in their immune system and b lindness. And this deficiency of vitamin A 
caused by eating rice afflicts about 400 million people worldwide. Well, rice is only 
two chemical steps away from being able to make beta carotene. This is a genetically 
modified version of rice that has those two extra steps inserted in it. 

And you can see  it's golden because it's making beta carotene. If people were to eat 
that form of rice then they wouldn't have this problem with vitamin A deficiency. 
Penny Chisholm in her part of the course will be considering things that are more 
global level. Here's a picture of our p lanet, and there are issues that you know about 
there. This is the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere rising. And that's a real 
phenomenon. 

This shows from 1960 to 1995. This is associated with a g lobal warming that again is 
undeniab le that it's happening. You'll see stuff in the papers. And these gases, 
particularly carbon d ioxide and methane, they're known as greenhouse gases are 
playing a  role  in that. And probably mankind is playing a  role  in the production of 
those gases and, hence,  in globa l warming. And Penny will ta lk to you a  little more 
about that. Right here at MIT Mario Molina in EAPS d iscovered the ozone hole and 
got a Nobel prize for that. Ozone is important because it absorbs UV, a critical 
component of ultraviolet rad iation that would damage our cells if we were exposed to 
it. And because of the emission of fluorocarbons in the environment this large hole 
developed over Antarctic. 

If that had spread, it would have been a  rea l d isaster. And that seems to be, the 
efforts to cut down the release of fluorocarbons seem to be helping w ith that. But, 
again, Penny will have more to say. Those of you who've lived around here for a little 
bit probab ly know that the fishing industry just locally has had a very hard time. 
There  is a fishing boat just up in Gloucester, just up the coast less than an hour from 
here. And part of the problems, again, are caused by mismanagement of the 
resources where the fish have been, stocks have been over-fished so some of the 
fisheries have come to the point of collapse or near. 

Places such as the Grand Banks off of Newfound land there has been a collapse, and 
it's not at a ll clear that it can be reversed and whether they'll be cod in large 
quantities every again there. OK. So there a variety of ways that we can study 
biology. 

And I think I'm going to beg in by outlining how we do that. Biology is an 
experimental science and it's one of the really important themes that we'll run 
through in this course. You cannot study biology by just sitting down w ith a pen and 
paper in a room and thinking. You have to get out and find out what's there. You 
need to make observations. You need to try experiments. You need to formulate 
hypotheses and test them and either modify your hypothesis or reject it and so on. 
But it's a continual cycle of experimentation and making hypotheses and testing. It's 
the Scientific Method at work. But you can carry that out at d ifferent levels. The very 
highest level would be the biosphere. 

Here's one examp le. That's earth. It's here. There are many, many species of life 
that are on there. There are many more than a million. And the estimates of how 
many there are range from, in tota l, 10 to the 20 million estimated. And one of the 
big worries right at the moment is that as rain forests are being depleted, parts of 
the world that are a rich source of biolog ical diversity, as those are d isappearing 
we're losing d iversity at quite a  rate. Just a couple of years ago I had a chance to fly 
over a part of Brazil. And it was just scary to see from the plane how the ra in forest 
was just being cut down. 

And you could just see how fast some of the rain forest was disappearing, and with it 
many d ifferent types of species that only can live there. One can look  instead, going 
down a level, at an ecosystem which is a particular environment -- -- and the species 
of life found in it. And just to g ive you a couple of examples of that, it could be a sa lt 
marsh as shown here. Or here's an interesting environment that Penny Chisholm w ill 
tell you more about. This is a black smoker. There's a vent severa l miles deep in the 
Pacific Ocean. The water temperature that's gushing out of here is around 360 
degree centigrade. And there's a particular community of life that's able to grow 
around these deep vents. 

And Penny will tell you more about that. Then going down yet another level you can 
come to a population. And this is  interacting -- -- or interbreed ing organisms. An 
example might be the fiddler crabs in a sa lt marsh. Or here we see an  interesting 
population. These are tube worms that are up to a meter or more in length that you 
find down at these b lack smokers. If we move down yet another level -- -- we come 
to organisms. 

Organisms have three important sorts of characteristics that we'll talk quite a bit 
about in this course. They carry out metabolism which is the sum of a ll the d ifferent 
chemical reactions necessary for life. They undergo regulated growth -- -- and they 
reproduce. And the sort of fundamental unit of life that we will talk about over and 
over aga in in this course is known as a cell. And life comes in two kinds of species. 
There  is unicellular life where the organism  is just a single cell and multicellular 
forms of life that are made of many different types of cells. 

What's a cell? One of the secrets to life. It's a little tiny bit of the universe that's 
surrounded by a boundary. And it's given the special name of a membrane. It's 
selective, not very permeable to most things. And cells are able to put little 
importers and exporters and things that control the passage of things across the 
membrane by isolating the inside of a cell from all the rest of the universe. That is 
one of the principles that makes life possib le. We have a couple of examp les of 
organisms here. 

Here are some clams that grow down at those black smokers, and they can get 
pretty large. And, as I say, Penny will ta lk a bit more about this. And we have this 
really amaz ing diversity of life forms that we find on this p lanet. However, if we think 
about this d ivision into unicellular and multicellular organisms. Unicellular organisms 
include things that you're familiar w ith. They're bacteria. There is a p icture of just E. 
coli cells. And we'll be ta lking about E. coli quite a b it as a model organism as we go 
through the course. By studying E. coli, scientists have learned many important 
things that apply to all of life. Another kind of important single-celled organism, 
unicellular organism is yeast. 

Those are pictures of yeast saccharomyces that are used in baking bread or in 
brewing beer or making w ine. And another one you're all familiar w ith are a lgae 
which are sing le-celled organisms that are able to carry out photosynthesis. And we'll 
be talking about that. If we think of an example of a multicellular organism then we 
see there are different levels at which we can think about this. We could take, for 
example, a picture of me, just an anatomically correct d iagram here, that I'm made 
up, as you are, of about ten to the fourteenth human cells. We a ll started out as a 
fertilized egg, which is a sing le cell. 

And by the time we're grown up, where we have about ten to the fourteenth human 
cells. Just a tremendous amount of cell growth that had to happen and 
specialization. The other thing you may not appreciate is that we have an ecosystem 
inside us in our gastrointestinal tract. This part,  the intestine having  the highest 
concentration of microorganisms. But there are about ten to the fourteenth bacteria 
also  inside of our gut. So we're actually a lmost the same number of human cells and 
bacteria l cells. And if we don't have those bacteria then our digestive systems don't 
work well. So if we go down  from a whole organism, a whole multicellular organism, 
a level, then we come to an organ. 

An example of that might be an eye. And I think we have a d iagram of an eye which 
is made up of d ifferent parts. If we go down another level we come to a tissue. 
Which is now you can beg in to see that tissue are made up of groups of specialized 
cells. An examp le might be the retina of an eye. And  if we continue to go downwards 
we'll get to sing le cells. And at this point we're at the same level of the ta il as when 
we're talking about a unicellular organism. If we continue down then -- -- we can get 
to organelles. 

These are involved in energy production, energy management. And mitochondrion 
and chloroplasts are the two princip le examp les of organelles that we'll talk about. 
And if we go down yet another level of organization we get to molecules. And part of 
the reason that biology has flourished so well over the last few decades at MIT is 
there has been a  rea l emphasis on looking at things at a cellular and molecular level. 
So you're going to be hearing a lot about cells and a lot about molecules as we go 
through this course. 

Here's an examp le of rhodopsin. That's a protein. We'll be ta lking about what 
proteins are, but it's a very important class of molecule in nature. In this case, 
proteins involved in sensing  light and p lay an important part in your vision. Here is 
another protein. You cannot really tell what it's doing by just looking at it, but in this 
case this is one of the letha l factors that is made by anthrax. It's one of the proteins 
that anthrax makes that's capable of killing you  if you get infected w ith it. Here's 
another molecule we'll talk about in great deta il. This is DNA. You probably a ll know 
it's a double helix, two strands of DNA that are held together by forces we'll be 
discussing. It's an absolutely beautiful molecule. 

It's fascinated me through a ll of my life. And we'll be ta lking quite a b it about that as 
the course goes on. OK. So if we're thinking about cells there are two important 
kinds of cells that one finds on this planet. Prokaryotic cells. Prokaryotic organisms 
and eukaryotic organisms. They each are made of cells that are d istinguishable from 
each other. I've indicated that a cell is a little b it of the universe that's surrounded by 
a boundary or a membrane. But inside there, inside of this is the DNA which 
functions as the genetic material. It's the blueprint for everything that that cell is 
going to make and be able to do. 

Ultimately everything is encoded there. And in a prokaryotic cell the DNA is free 
within this membrane. The eukaryotic cell a lso has a membrane. But the DNA inside 
is inside another membrane compartment known as the nucleus. And this is the 
DNA. These prokaryotic cells tend to be of the order of a kilometer in length. And 
eukaryotic cells are usua lly larger, can be ten to a hundred kilometers. There's quite 
a bit of variation, but that g ives you at least some sense of the range. 

Now, I've for years, when I did a d iagram like this, I wanted to somehow be able to 
show you that these cells were impressive than  just what's on the board. So here are 
a couple of p ictures to try and do that. This shows a picture of E. coli sw imming 
along. And the way this image is being taken lets you see what are called  flagella but 
which are basically the propellers that E. coli have that let it swim through the water. 
These are long structures made of proteins that are several times the body length of 
the bacterium. 

And there's a molecular motor imbedded in the bacterium that whirls it around at 
about somewhere between 10,000 and 100,000 RPM. And that's what drives the 
bacteria forward. So that was a prokaryotic cell. Here's a paramecium. This is a 

sing le-celled eukaryotic organism. And, as you can see here, it's capable of 
movement as well. In this case it has cilia along  the outside that allow it to move. 
Here's an interesting one. I don't know if any of you can guess what these were. 
These were cells from the skin of a mouse. They're on an Auger surface. And, as you 
can see, they too can move. 

There are a coup le of things that are important about this. I got this slide from Linda 
Griffith who is in the Biological Eng ineering Department. At the time I got it from her 
I think it was in Chemica l Eng ineering several years ago. And what was important 
about this, apart from  it being a very nice little movie showing you a mamma lian cell 
moving around, was that I saw Linda show  this during one of her research seminars. 
So here is an engineer at MIT who was showing this picture as part of her research 
talk. 

And I think those of you who are going onto eng ineering, you may be surprised at 
the extent to which you need to know about biology as you go through your 
professional careers. OK. So one of the great discoveries that has happened over the 
last few years that came out of our ability to look at DNA and RNA was the discovery 
that the forms of life that are prokaryotic actua lly split into two d istinct Kingdoms 
that are very, very d ifferent. The archaea and the bacteria. 

And just to g ive you a sense of the d iversity of life, I'll just mention a couple of 
these. These archaea look like bacteria but they are diverged  from the bacteria as 
they are from the eukaryotes. So there were sort of three rea lly major Kingdoms of 
Life. And the archaea, many of them can live in specialized environments. For 
example, sulfolobus can live at about 90 degrees centigrade and a pH of somewhere 
between 1 and 2. So if you see something like a hot springs, there are organisms 
such as this that are able to grow in that environment. Or there are halophyes, salt-
loving archaea  that can grow, for example, in formula sodium chloride. And if you've, 
for examp le, ever flown into San Francisco airport coming up from the south over 
San Jose, you've seen things that look sort of like these p ictures where seawater is 
being evaporated down to collect the salt. 

And you'll see they're colored, and the reason they're colored is that these 
halobacteria are photobacteria that are ab le to use light as an energy source. And 
they make pigments that absorb the light, and that's why these salt areas get 
colored. A third example would be methanogens. 

These are organisms that produce methane. If you've walked into a lake and stepped 
on the bottom and seen little bubb les come up,  those are little bubb les of methane. 
Or another place where you  find methanogens are inside of cows. Now, some of you 
may not know that the cow is more or less a walking anaerob ic fermentor here. If we 
have an anatomica lly correct picture of a cow. The inside of the cow, there's a large 
chamber known as the rumen where there's no oxygen, and there's a culture of 
microorganisms there that include methanogens. And it's this combination of 
microorganisms that enab les cows to each grass that we cannot manage to get 
energy from. 

And as a byproduct of this specialized type of metabolism produces methane. And a 
cow burps something of the order of 400 liters a day of methane. OK. So one last 
thing then just to kind of pull this all together is that these organelles that I 
mentioned, which are also membrane compartments that are found in eukaryotic 
cells, are the mitochondria -- -- or chlorop last. 

There's pretty strong evidence at this point that these arose from bacteria that were 
things that you're more familiar with. Things like E. coli or streptococcus that causes 
strep throat or the lactic acid bacteria  that causes the milk to turn into yogurt which 
some of you probably had for lunch today. That these organelles, the mitochondria 
and the chloroplast were derived from particular type of bacteria that probab ly first 
got transiently associated w ith developing eukaryotic cells sometime back in 
evolution, and eventua lly became captured and became a permanent part of the 
eukaryotic cell. The mitochondrion is thought to have derived from something that 
looks like today's present day rizobia, which we'll talk about,  that form an 
intracellular infection of p lants, or rickettsia which is chronic  intracellular pathogen. 
The mitochondrion look as though they came from something related to that. 

The chlorop lasts look as though they came from a bacterium that was ab le to carry 
on photosynthesis which we'll also be talking about. I want to close by giving you 
just a quick little snapshot of evolution because I'm hoping this will maybe make 
some of the things that we talk about in this course clearer. So what we're going to 
do is we're going to look back from 4.5 billion years ago when the earth was just 
forming -- -- to now. 

I'm just going to try and give you a  few key sort of landmarks as we go a long. So 
about 4.5 b illion years ago there was methane, carbon dioxide, ammonium, 
hydrogen gas, nitrogen gas, water, but importantly no oxygen at that point. There 
was a  lot of debate as to how life initia lly came. One of the prevalent theories at this 
point  is there's something called an RNA world. This is just a hypothesis  in which  it's 
thought that perhaps the molecule RNA, which we'll talk about, played  role as both 
something that was able to cata lyze chemica l reactions and therefore did things 
actively and also stored information. But, in any case, the best guess is that the first 
life that was about 3.8 billion years ago, somewhere in that vicinity. It was 
something that probab ly resembled most closely a present-day bacterium, a sing le-
celled organism, something like that. 

Now, initia lly when life got started it's thought that there were a  lot of organic 
chemicals that had been made as a consequence of lightening strikes and a ll sorts of 
chemistry that had happened so there was sort of a soup of some kind, some 
molecules that could be used. So probab ly these first organisms where ab le to 
basically use some preformed nutrients. 

And then as the soup began to get dep leted by using it they had to learn to 
synthesize, at least develop systems that would synthesize these building blocks. 
And they a lso had to begin to worry about what to use as energy. And so somewhere 
in here, something that I'll ca ll, in a silly way, photosynthesis released number one. 
But this was a system  that enab led the organism to capture energy from sunlight so 
that it wasn't now dependent on getting energy by eating some preformed 
ingred ient. 

It was then able to take carbon d ioxide and make it into  forms that were useful, of 
carbon that were useful for life, and it produced molecules such as sulfur as a waste 
product. There was a b it later in evolution, somewhere in here, something we might 
think of as photosynthesis release two. This was an improved version of 
photosynthesis. It captured more energy, worked better, but it developed, it had a 
waste product which was oxygen. Well, oxygen hadn't been in our atmosphere. 

And the first thing that sort of happened was that the world started to rust. All the 
iron, a lot of the iron started to interact w ith the oxygen. And Penny will tell you that 
at the base of the sea there are huge beds of iron oxide that came from this slow 
rusting of the earth. And so it took many, many years before oxygen levels started 
to rise. As you know it's about 20% of our atmosphere now. Even at this stage it was 
only a  few percent of our, made up a few percent of our atmosphere, even by here in 
evolution. 

The first eukaryotic cell is thought to have appeared somewhere here. Aga in, it was 
likely a sing le-celled organism like some of those p ictures I showed you. And 
evolution continued to go. Somewhere around a billion years ago sex was evolved 
which enabled eukaryotic organisms to exchange genetic material, and therefore 
evolve at a  fast rate than they could previously. The Cambrian Period was about a 0. 

5 b illion to 0.6 b illion years ago. And there was a veritable explosion of life forms. 
And you can still see in the fossil records how much diversity was generated at that 
point, some of which went on to become  life forms and other which probably were 
more evolutionary dead ends. F inally we get to the dinosaurs that were about 245 to 
65 million years ago which would place them somewhere here on this timeline. So in 
honor of this course, I've commissioned a full scale model of anatomically correct 
[NOISE OBSCURES]. So we'll put our d inosaur here, if I can get him to stay put for a 
minute. 

All right. And at this point in evolution things started to get interesting. So 
somewhere about here, 4 million years ago we've got the first evidence of 
hominoids. Maybe 20,000 years ago we found the cave paintings in France. And then 
there was the Roman Emp ire and Columbus d iscovered America. And you were born 
and the Red Sox won the World Series and the Patriots have just won the Super 
Bowl. And we are now here at the peak of evolution which is, as you all know, the 
MIT student. So we'll put our MIT student here, who I can probab ly not get to stay 
put because you can never get MIT students to stay anywhere. 

But,  in any case, this is sort of a silly demonstration. But there  is a very profound 
reason why I'm doing it. And  I must say I don't think I'd ever fully appreciated it 
until I actua lly thought of doing this demo for the class. But what I think you can see 
is that evolution, for the most part, happened at the sing le cell level. Many people 
tended to think evolution, that was about dinosaurs and a ll that stuff. 

We can say that d inosaurs are, practically now, most of evolution occurred at the 
level of single cells, and that a ll this amazing d iversity we see around us was very 
recent embellishments in evolution. So that means when you study biology at the 
cellular and molecular level you find tremendous commona lities. If you look inside a 
sulfolobus growing in hot spring, if you  look inside an E. 

coli, if you look inside a yeast and you look  inside one of our cells you  find that, to a 
huge extent, many, many of the cellular components are common. They arose 
similarly in evolution that they're shared by a ll forms of life. Of course, there are 
some things that developed later and are d ifferent. But that's one of the reasons that 
you can learn so much by studying biology at the cellular molecular level and why 
we'll emphasize it a  fair b it in this course. The other thing that I'd like to make out of 
this, a theme that you'll hear a long is that organisms modify their environment. You 
can see that in the case of oxygen back when the earth formed. There was no 
oxygen in our atmosphere. Now we have a lot of it. The reason it's there is because 

it was generated by organisms carrying out photosynthesis and generating oxygen 
as a waste product. 

And that was an absolutely critical thing to enab le creatures such as ourselves, which 
are dependent on oxygen  for us just to be a live, if we hadn't had this change in 
environment things like us could have, organisms like us couldn't have evolved. So, 
anyway, I hope that will give you a little sort of snapshot of evolution and will help 
guide your understanding of this course. We'll see you at the next lecture.
