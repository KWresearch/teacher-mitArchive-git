Transcript â€“ Lecture 20 

This lecture is going to be very dependent upon the PowerPoint slides, because if I 
take the time to draw the cycles on the board, we'd be here forever. So I would say 
sit back and relax because you have the slides. They're on the Web. And try to focus 
on what the take-home message is. OK, but before we go on to biogeochemical 
cycles, I want to just briefly review some of the things that we learned in the second 
lecture. 

I got feedback from many of you, actually, on the things that were d ifficult to 
understand from that  lecture, and those are important for understanding these 
cycles. And the one thing that some people were confused by was this anaerobic 
resp iration. Remember, I drew this on the board, and it showed a lot of reduction 
reactions. And I think that was confusing for some people, so let's just go over that 
very quickly. 

You've learned in Graham's lectures, and in my lectures, that aerob ic resp iration, 
resp iration of organisms where there is oxygen, that oxygen is the terminal electron 
receptor here in that electron transport chain and it's reduced to water. So in aerobic 
environments, when organisms resp ire oxygen it's reduced to water. If there's no 
oxygen around, the organisms, and in this case  it's a lways bacteria, look for the next 
thermodynamically favorab le electron acceptor. 

And so, whatever is dominant in that environment and is most thermodynamically 
favorab le, they'll use. So, the sulfate reducing organisms use sulfate and reduce to 
H2S. Denitrifying organisms use nitrate and  reduce it to these forms of reduced 
nitrate or reduce nitrogen. And we ta lked about  iron bacteria Fe plus three, and 
reduce  it to Fe p lus two. Some can use manganese, etc. Whatever's there, and it's 
thermodynamically favorab le, they'll use. 

OK, so  that clarifies that. Some of the peop le said, you kept talking about symmetry. 
You kept talking about symmetry. I didn't see any symmetry, and in hindsight I can 
understand why, because I just threw  that out and I d idn't really point it out. So 
what I was talking about was as we went through these processes, you see here, 
these elements, sulfate and nitrogen, nitrate, are being reduced. 

There are other processes, particularly chemosynthesis in which these reduced 
compounds, here's H2S and ammonia are being oxid ized. So that's the symmetry 
that I was talking about. And if you d idn't have that, if a ll the organisms were 
reducing things, the whole system would run down. You have to have organisms that 
are a lso oxidizing things. And that's a key component of a ll of these, or not all of the 
biogeochemica l cycles, but particularly the cycles of nitrogen and sulfur, which have 
this redox chemistry. 

So that's the symmetry that I was talking about. OK, now so let's talk about how we 
think about biogeochemical cycles. Can you see the slide in the back? Try to turn the 
lights off? That was a double question. Can you see the slide in the back? Yes? OK. 
So this is a generic map of the components of biogeochemical cycles. And we can 

think of the earth as a giant chemica l factory in the sense that has what we call 
compartments, or reservoirs, or pools of a particular element. 

Or it might be water that we are ana lyz ing, and  then there are fluxes between these 
pools. So here's a  flux, an arrow. So typica lly these are d iagrammed with boxes and 
arrows connecting them. And you don't have to use all of these boxes. It could be we 
are just looking at land, atmosphere, and ocean. I mean, you can construct whatever 
model you want for these. And these are just some useful conversion  factors for the 
amount of things that we're going to have flow ing between these compartments. 

And here, again, this is something we defined earlier when we were ta lking about 
productivity. The mean residence time of, say, an element, say, carbon in the 
terrestrial biomass, is the pool size, the amount of carbon that's there divided by the 
mean flux  in or out of the pool, OK? It's exactly the same concept we talked about 
for carbon. And then the fractiona l turnover, one over the mean residence time  is 
simply the fraction. 

If we're talking about carbon again in trees, it's the fraction that's removed per unit 
time. OK, so you can see that when we talk about mean residence time of an 
element in one of these reservoirs, if the whole system is in a steady state, in other 
words, if the amount in a reservoir is chang ing,  the flux in is going to be the same as 
the flux out, right? You know  that. 

Just  like a bathtub, if you have water flow ing in, water flowing out,  the level w ill say 
the same if the flow  rate and is the same as the flow  rate out. But often in nature, 
you don't have that exactly. And if you don't, the size of these reservoirs is either 
increasing or decreasing. So when you're ana lyz ing these systems, your most of the 
time trying to get the very rough estimate of mean residence time. 

So if the flow in and the flow out isn't the same, you can either average them and 
use that as your flux, or you could define your residence time w ith respect to the 
flow  in or the flow out. So, these are just gross approximations. What we want to 
understand is the residence time thousands of years, millions of years, days, rough 
approximation. And the other thing  I want to say before we go on,  is that all of these 
cycles, we're going to  talk about them element by element: phosphorus, carbon, 
whatever. 

But they're all tightly coupled in the system. And we'll bring that up aga in later. 
Before we go on, let's just  look at the solar energy budget, which  is driving this 
whole system, mostly, there is some geotherma l energy, energy from the Earth's, 
the magma that is also driving biogeochemica l cycles. But the solar energy is the 
primary driver. And if you say that the tota l energy from the sun is 100%,  it's that 
energy that is used in evaporation, and winds, and photosynthesis that is the 
important component driving the cycles. 

And you'll see that photosynthesis is a tiny fraction. The energy that plants harvest is 
a tiny fraction of the tota l energy that is driving the Earth's system. And yet, this 
photosynthesis, which is the basis of the b iosphere, has an enormous effect on the 
cond itions on Earth. That's an interesting nonlinearity of the system. OK, so let's 
start w ith the geological cycle, which is the slowest moving, people don't even think 
of it as a cycle because while we are on Earth we don't see rocks flying through, well, 
sometimes you see rocks in a landslide or whatever, but for the most part you don't 
think of rocks as cycling. 

But they do. And if they didn't,  the system would run down much faster than it is. 
And we've all heard about p late tectonics, that the surface of the Earth is made up of 
these plates that are slow ly shifting. And when they shift you have earthquakes, like 
we've had recently a lot of. And a lso, you have volcanic eruptions that bring material 
from the  inside of the Earth up to the surface and it overflows. 

And that's part of this geological cycle. So, here's a  really oversimplified, when the 
geology professor in our department saw that ever show ing this he had a heart 
attack by how simp lified it is. But it's just so you get the idea. When he started 
editing it, there are so many arrows you can never cope w ith that. But just get the 
idea. There's geothermal energy coming in from the inner core of the Earth where 
you have magma. 

Think volcanic eruption, lava, which ultimately becomes surface rocks. And they're 
eroded by weathering by ra in, and then elements from that go into  the soils. Soils 
eventua lly become sedimentary rocks. We're ta lking over really, really long time 
periods, which become metamorphic rocks. Some of those are uplifted, and some of 
them are melted and become magma. But it is a cycle, a very, very slow cycle. 

In fact, somewhere I read 70%, you do not need to know this. This is not geology 
class. But just so you have an idea, 75% of the rocks now on the surface of the 
earth have been uplifted. So it's almost as if the Earth is, on average, maybe ha lfway 
through a cycle. So, this erosion here, and weathering, as we talked about  last time 
is critica l for making nutrients ava ilab le to the biosphere. 

And the force of this weathering is incred ibly powerful. One number that I found in 
one textbook that I never knew before is that Niagara Fa lls is erod ing at 3 feet per 
year. The cusp of the fa lls from the water is moving back 3 feet per year. That's fast. 
Another little factoid when I gave this lecture one year, students asked what is going 
to burn out first on the Earth, the sun or the geotherma l energy? And of course I had 
no idea. 

This will be over someday. The Earth is going to be history because w ithout the sun 
and w ithout the geotherma l energy there's no source of energy. So I went to my 
colleagues in this department, Earth Atmosphere and Planetary Sciences, and sa id, 
which is going to burn out first? And they said, roughly the same time. And we have 
about 2 billion years, so not to worry yet. But it  is, we are only here for a period of 
time. 

So, that's the geolog ic cycle. Now, let's move onto the water cycle, and then we're 
going to go through the element cycles of nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon. But the 
water cycle is obviously important in carrying those elements through their cycles. 
And the cycle is actually fairly well understood. I say fa irly because not all of these 
things, when you're ta lking about globa l averages of things it's very difficult. 

But the weather service is very interested in the globa l water cycle. So there's been 
a lot of study done. So in terms of reservoirs, these numbers  in black are the 
amounts of water in a  reservoir. And the numbers  in blue are the number of fluxes 
annua lly of the amounts of water moving from one to another. So, there is a lot of 
water in groundwater. There's a lot of water in ice, and there's a lot of water in the 
oceans. 

And there's very little water in the atmosphere. These are the annual fluxes. So you 
can see, if I animated this right, so 111, these are in terms of square kilometers of 
water, that's a lot of water. So, 111 minus 71 gives you 40. So that's the rainfa ll. 
This is the evapotranspiration, and the net result is 40,000 that is flow ing into the 
oceans. And in the oceans, here's the evaporation and here's the rainfa ll going in 
with just a net of 40 that's transported from the oceans to land. 

So you have 40,000 going into the oceans, and 40,000 coming back, fairly nicely 
balanced. That's good. And so, let's just use this as an example to say, what's the 
residence time of water. Let's just calculate this. We can just approximate. So the 
mean residence time is equa l to the pool size divided by the flux, right? So what's 
the pool size? Well, how much water there in the ocean? Thank you. 

1.35 times 10^9. And, what's the flux? Well, we have 425,000 evaporating and we 
have 40 going here. So, I would add this and that so it's ba lanced. So, I would use 
425. 4.25 times 105 equa ls just roughly how many years? 3,000 years roughly. So 
we would say the residence time, the average molecule, the average water 
molecules floating through this system would spend on average thousands of years 
in the oceans before it would evaporate and get back into  the system. 

So you should now think about what the average residence time is, for example, in 
the atmosphere. And you can see when the pool is very sma ll relative to  the fluxes, 
the residence time  is going to be very short, right? That's something to remember. 
When the pool is huge relative to the fluxes, the residence time is going to be very 
long. So, you should  think about that as you go  through your notes. 

But,  in oceans, the residence time is thousands of years in groundwater. The 
residence time, again, can be very long, which is why we don't want to contaminate 
our groundwater because it's going to take a really long time to  flush that through. 
Lakes: the residence time is on the order of decades, streams on the order of weeks, 
and atmosphere I'll let you calculate it and figure it out. 

OK, let's move on now to an element cycle, the global phosphorous cycle. First of all, 
there's no redox chemistry in the cycle. That's important. OK, that's the first thing to 
remember. And it's ca lled a sedimentary cycle because there is no atmospheric 
component. There is essentially no phosphorus in the atmosphere. Everything in this 
field,  there's always an exception. 

There  is something ca lled phosphine that comes out of bogs that is really interesting. 
But it's not a huge amount, so it doesn't really matter in this analysis. And, let's look 
at it here. We have a  fair amount of phosphorus in  land plants. And there's internal 
cycling here. We have the mining of phosphorus from rocks. This is a fertilizer. No, 
that's not a mine; that's a house. Sorry. The mine is invisible. 

Here's the mine. So, the phosphorus is being mined. It's put on crops as fertilizer. 
The crops are eaten by the peop le in the house, and the phosphorus ends up  in 
sewage. Even if it's treated, it ends up in the rivers, and  it ends up  flow ing into the 
oceans. And there's a little b it in dust transport here, but if you look at this whole 
system, it's basically the phosphorous cycle is a one-way flow to the oceans. 

The only return of the cycle is via the sed imentary cycle where you go from 
sediments. Those are sedimentary rocks until you go to mineab le rock and through 
uplifting. And this is on geological timesca les. So, on the earth today, the global 

phosphorous cycle is really not a cycle. It's a one-way flow to the oceans. Well, it's a 
cycle, but it's an extremely unba lanced cycle because eventually this one will come 
back. 

It cycles very rapidly in the b iota, interna l cycling in the ocean. So, it comes in the 
river, it's taken up by phytop lankton, they're eaten by zooplankton, and then the 
phosphorus is excreted or bacteria chew on dead organisms take up the 
phosphorous. It's excreted as organic phosphorous, and it cycles rapid ly through this 
system. OK. So the other important feature of this one way flow, and also humans 
have altered. 

In other words, humans are responsible for this, basica lly, one-way flow by mining 
the phosphorus and putting it into the agricultural system. OK, yeah, and there's the 
return flux. OK, moving on to the nitrogen cycle, which is much more comp licated 
because it is redox chemistry, OK? And, humans have a lso had a major, major, 
major effect on the globa l nitrogen cycle. So, let's first look at the globa l nitrogen 
transformation. 

So this isn't a pools and fluxes diagram. This is a summary for you of things you 
already know. You a lready know this. It just looks different than what you learned in 
the second lecture. So let's just go through it very quickly. If we think of the 
compounds of nitrogen as being either reduced or oxidized and we think of the 
environment where they might be found as either being aerob ic or oxic, having 
oxygen, or anaerobic, anoxic, not having oxygen. 

We can draw a schematic of these processes that hopefully makes good sense. If we 
start w ith organic nitrogen, but say it's a dead whale that you saw is organic 
nitrogen, bacteria work on it, and through this process which you haven't rea lly 
learned about explicitly at, can convert that to  free ammonia. That ammonia can be 
used in chemosynthesis, which you  learned about. 

OK, the specific type of chemosynthesis is called nitrification, where this ammonia is 
converted to nitrite. Is that an oxidation or a  reduction? Shout it out. Yes, yes. It's 
an oxidation. This was obvious because you can actually see the oxygen. So, in that, 
nitrite a lso in chemosynthesis can be further oxidized to nitrate. And 
chemosynthesis, so this is an energy releasing process for these bacteria. 

Now, so here we now have nitrogen in an oxidized form, and we are in an anoxic 
environment, and that should immediately tell you, oh, that's an electron acceptor 
for the anaerobic bacteria which are going to dump their electrons on this and 
convert it to NO or N2O. These are gases, and nitrogen gas. This is denitrification or 
anaerob ic resp iration, which we already talked about. And it also can be converted 
through nitrogen fixation, N2 gas can be converted to ammonia. 

We already ta lked about this, too. Remember, bacteria and cyanobacteria are the 
only organisms that can take nitrogen gas from the atmosphere and converted to 
ammonia for the use of other organisms. OK, and then there's one other thing here 
which is ca lled assimilatory nitrate reduction. And that is when organisms just take 
up nitrate, and inside them, and they reduce it so that they can, they have to reduce 
it to ammonia in order to reduce it for protein synthesis. 

So that's another route for nitrate to become organic nitrogen in an oxidized 
environment. So these are the important b iological transformations in the cycle. So, 

here's the cycle in all of its complexity. And redox is  important. That's a feature. I'm 
going to list these things, and then we'll look at them on the d iagram, has a gaseous 
phase, in other words, is an important atmosphere component, N2, NO, N2O, and by 
the way, this is a very powerful greenhouse gas. 

So, the balance or imba lance in the nitrogen cycle that results in more or less N2O is 
very important for globa l climate regulation. N itrogen  fixation by microbes and 
humans: very important. And denitrification by microbes is the only way to return 
nitrogen to the atmosphere. If you didn't have denitrification, this process that you 
learned in my second lecture that you thought was just some weird way things get 
through life, is  incred ibly important  in ma inta ining the g lobal nitrogen cycle. 

So, let's look at this, the deta ils here. So, in terms of nitrogen fixation, that's taking 
N2 gas and converting it to ammonia. Biological fixation by p lants, or it's really not 
by p lants. It's by the symbiotic microbes in their roots is 140 times 1012 of grams 
per year. The industria l electrician  fixation, that  is, what's done by humans, there's a 
process ca lled the Haber process that's incredib ly energy intensive. 

It takes a lot of fossil fuel to break that nitrogen trip le bond. In other words, to take 
nitrogen gas and convert it to ammonia, you have to break this triple bond which is 
very energy intensive. But they figured that out during World War II basically, or was 
it World War I? Anyway, one of the wars, how  to break that bond, and that was the 
beginning of the nitrogen fertilizer industry. 

So, this  is human nitrogen fixation that is used to fertilize crops. So this is a huge 
fraction of the natura l fixation. I mean, this adds a huge amount of nitrogen flux to 
the system. OK, in this flux here, this is cultivated legume. So, this would be 
agricultura l bean p lants that naturally have nitrogen fixers in them, and that also 
import nitrogen  into the system. So, we consider that part of the human flux. 

OK, to balance this, we have denitrification, which as I said is done by microbes on 
land and in the ocean. So, looking at this, is it balanced? Is nitrogen fixation on a 
global sca le and denitrification ba lanced? Did I hear a no? Which is greater? 
Denitrification, yeah. If you add this, this, and this, you get 260. Is that right? Yeah, 
and then you add this, this, and this you get 310. 

So, there's more nitrogen going into the atmosphere than we're taking out. And 
people don't understand this. They think the denitrification has been 
disproportionately stimulated by this huge flux of nitrogen into the system. But this 
is an important imbalance that a  lot of people are studying very hard. OK, yeah. 
That's the major feature that you want to look at in the system. And then, if we 
compare, this figure  is from your textbook comparing the b iological nitrogen  fixation. 

Plus, lightning fixes it a little b it. Compared to the human, you can see that humans 
are now responsible for an equa l amount of nitrogen  flux on a globa l scale as the 
natural system. This is a dramatic perturbation, and that's only  in the last 50 years 
or so, dramatic perturbation to the system. This amount that we are doing is, 140 
gigatons is equivalent to 10 million trucks of dry nitrogen fertilizer that we are 
putting into the system w ith completely unknown effects. 

OK, the next series of slides are just to illustrate in one ecosystem the importance of 
the b iota and maintaining nitrogen in the ecosystem. And  I'll a lso just show you the 
importance of experiments in ecology. And this is the Hubbard Brook Experimental 

Forest, which is up  in New Hampshire. Some of you might have even visited there. 
This was my first job as a graduate student was actually working in the forest. 

I was measuring phosphorous concentrations in the streams. And what they do 
there, just like that experimental lake study I showed you, here, they have permits 
from the forest service to clear cut entire watersheds. A watershed is just an area 
that collects the rainfall and directs it into a sing le stream. You can collect the ra in 
and measure what's  in it, and you can collect the water coming out and measure 
what's in it. 

And the difference is what the ecosystem  is actually doing. So, what they did was 
they had these two watersheds that were the same, and they clear cut one of them. 
And they asked w ith the influence of this clear cutting was on the quality of the 
water coming out of the system. And to make a  long story very short, it's a  really 
fascinating study that's been going on for years that I don't want to tell you because 
then you'll know how old I am. 

But, here's the control watershed, and here's the water coming out of the 
devegetated one, showing massive eflux of nitrate from the system as well as other 
cations. And your textbook does a  terrib le job of not expla ining this. And I don't have 
time to go into the details. But, the major reason this is lost, the vegetation is rea lly 
important in that, but it's important in a lso maintaining the microbial community in 
the soil. 

And when it's cut down, the microbia l community changes. And that is very 
important and  resulting in the loss. It's a beautiful study, which unfortunately we 
don't have time to go into. But if you're interested, I can point you in the right 
direction. OK, now, let's go  into the rea lly important, well, they're a ll important 
because they're all coupled. 

But this is the one that's getting a  lot of attention, the g lobal carbon cycle. And it's 
getting a lot of attention because we have had an incredib ly significant impact on it, 
and we are worried about that causing major global warming. And as an aside, I'll 
just tell you that I actually think the global nitrogen cycle is a sleeping g iant, and 
that the pub lic doesn't know much about that right now. 

But in the scientific community, we know the perturbation we've had on that cycle 
could end up being equa lly, if not more, traumatic for the Earth's climate as this. But 
that's an aside. So let's focus on this now. So, here's the g lobal carbon cycle, which 
you've seen now severa l times in my lectures. So here's gross primary productivity, 
and resp iration by land p lants, resp iration by the soils. 

These are RA and RH that we ta lked about before. And in this, we have their 
balance, roughly balanced, and then you have uptake by the oceans, and loss of CO2 
by the oceans. Your textbook says this is a ll a physical and chemical process that's 
absolutely wrong. The biota are central to that, and that's another lecture. But you 
already know that, that the phytop lankton are sucking a lot of CO2 in through 
photosynthesis. 

So let's look at the budget here. And, this  is the  introduction of CO2 into the 
atmosphere by burning fossil fuel, and the introduction of CO2 into the atmosphere 
by destruction of vegetation. So, we have 7.5 gigatons going into the atmosphere 
due to human perturbation. The annua l increase of CO2 in the atmosphere is 3.5 

gigatons. So, 3.5 g igatons annua l increase, and, let's see. If we look at the 
difference here between resp iration and photosynthesis we see that there's 2 
gigatons going into the vegetation, actua lly net into the vegetation. 

And if we look at this, we see that there's two going into the ocean. So, if we ask, of 
all of this anthropogenic CO2 where's it going? 3.5 is going to increase in the 
atmosphere. Two is going to vegetation, and two is going to the ocean. And it's this 
that we are very concerned about because it's causing a dramatic increase in the 
CO2 in the atmosphere. Even though these are tiny fluxes relative to the global 
biolog ical fluxes, these tiny fluxes lead to a significant increase because the pool is 
so small of CO2 in the atmosphere. 

So, this  is a trace of CO2 since 1960. Here's a question  for you to think about. I'm 
not going to answer it. Its summer and winter are out of phase in the Northern and 
Southern Hemisphere, why isn't this just smooth? This cycle that we see here is an 
annua l cycle of the Earth breathing. Remember I showed you that the first lecture 
show ing photosynthesis greater than resp iration during the summer, and the reverse 
during the winter. 

Think about why it isn't just smooth and canceled out by the two hemispheres. OK, 
and if we look at that same graph,  this is atmospheric CO2 from ice core data as a 
function of time. This is today, and this is time before present going backwards. This 
is 450,000 years ago. We can see that CO2 in the atmosphere, and this is measured 
in, you take a deep ice core in Greenland, or something, and you measure the CO2 
concentration at different slices of the core. 

And it tells you what the Earth was like back then. And, this just dramatically shows 
you what we are doing just that the last hundred years. We have increased CO2 in 
the atmosphere dramatica lly by burning fossil fuels. And CO2 is a greenhouse gas, 
and so we are very concerned about that. OK, this  is just read showing that slide 
from last time of upwelling to remind you that the biogeochemica l cycles of these 
elements are tightly coup led. 

Remember, we talked about nutrients, nitrogen, phosphorus, being upwelled  from 
the deep water, phytoplankton taking them up, drawing down CO2 and then we had 
oxygen and CO2 going back and  forth  in the water. So, the oxygen cycle, which we 
haven't even ta lked about is tightly coupled also to the CO2 cycle. I'm not going to 
show  this there. OK, moving on, and I know this is quick, but this is in your readings. 

There  is a newspaper article about the Biosphere 2 experiment which now is pretty 
dated. To make a long story short, many years ago a very rich person built the 
system out in the middle of the Arizona desert. And it had seven ecosystems in it. It 
was sealed. It was closed. And, he put people in, which were ca lled biospherians, 
and the idea was to see whether humans could create a closed b iosphere that would 
susta in human life. 

And, it was a miserab le failure, which is sad because it costs a lot of money, and has 
since been taken over by Columb ia University to use it as an experimental facility. 
But the one thing that they learned, here's what happened. They put the people in. 
And it turned out that there was not enough photosynthesis to supply enough 
oxygen for the people to breathe. 

Oxygen levels stead ily went down. And the reason for that, they learned later, was 
that they had put way too much rich soil in the system. So, the bacteria in the soil 
were sucking the oxygen out of the atmosphere. And  they were subsid izing the 
system with rich soil so that peop le would have enough food. But there was a puzzle, 
because if this was the case, because the cycles are coup led, you should expect to 
see the same amount of, if this oxygen is coming from photosynthesis, you should 
see the same amount of CO2 coming into the system. 

And you should see an increase in CO2 in the atmosphere. And they d idn't. In other 
words, they saw oxygen going down, but they didn't see surp lus CO2 in the 
atmosphere. And it took a bright graduate student from Columbia University to go in 
there and figure out what was going on. And it turned out that, so why didn't CO2 
increase? It turned out that this CO2, which was coming out of the system from 
resp iration in the soil was actually binding to the ca lcium hydroxide in the cement 
and making ca lcium carbonate. 

So, the cement, another human invention, was playing an important role here. The 
point  is that none of this, this  is only understandable in hindsight, because  it didn't 
work. You can go in and figure out, what the heck, where did these imba lances come 
from? So, it was a very interesting study, and we learned that it's not easy to mimic 
natural biosphere on a very small sca le. 

OK, I'm going to skip that one, and come to this rea l quickly, because this was just 
on the news this morning as I was driving into work. I thought, perfect for this 
lecture. The UN just announced this millennium ecosystem assessment. It's on the 
web. And 2,000 scientists have been working on this for over ten years trying to 
assess the state of the g lobal ecosystems and their capab ility to support future 
generations, i. 

e. you guys. And they say the next 50 years, and those are the 50 years that you 
guys are in charge, are absolutely critical for whether or not these systems w ill 
susta in, be ab le to sustain human populations. So you can go to the web  if you're 
interested in that. OK, quickly to our civil and environmental engineering major, I'm 
just going to say that our new motto is nature, tools, and toys, that nature is 
ecology. 

There  is a two series ecology course. Tools are mechanics: basics, fundamentals for 
analyz ing systems. And toys is design. The part of the curriculum is going to be 
designing instrumentation  for studying environmenta l systems. And there are these 
brochures here and in the back. So I encourage you to p ick those up if you're at a ll 
interested in that major. Now, let me show you this cool clip. 

Don't leave yet. This is worth it. It's only two minutes, and its nature at  its best. So, 
all I need to do here is hit play. And this is the soccer player's  look like this. Oh, why 
didn't that work. myofauna are little bugs in the sand. That's my favorite part. Life  is 
a geolog ical agent. See, that would have been a great kick off for spring break, but 
welcome back from spring break. All right, I'll see you in a few weeks.
