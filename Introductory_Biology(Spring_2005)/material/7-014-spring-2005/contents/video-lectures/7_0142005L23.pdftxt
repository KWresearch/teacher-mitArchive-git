Transcript â€“ Lecture 23 

I just got the feedback from the one minute things just a few minutes before class, 
so I think I may defer commenting on the coup le of them until the beg inning of next 
lecture. But there are a coup le of things that I think I can say. One is, several people 
were wondering, how does the cell decide whether to do mitosis or meiosis? But the 
mitosis, which is ordinary cell division is what happens everywhere in your body, in 
your intestine, on your skin, in your eye, anywhere except, since thats how you 
make all the d ifferent cells you have. 

The meiosis, which creates the sex sells, or gametes, happens in a very specific 
place, either in the testes if you are male or the ovary if you are a female. So, 
there's a ded icated p lace where meiosis takes place, and just your knowledge of 
human anatomy and physiology can make a pretty good guess as to where that is. 
Everywhere else, it's mitosis. 

There's a very special place where that happens. A coup le of you still got confused 
when I was ta lking about meiosis and  I was showing you a progression through, and 
I put a double headed arrow, meaning that's what that period was called. The 
process is unidirectional. It only goes in one way. It's not a reversib le process. There 
were some questions about the chiasmata or the chiasma: why is there a crossover 
in chiasma in meiosis but not mitosis? I will tell you about that today very 
specifica lly. 

Why was there a ta ll and a short pair of chromosomes? That was arbitrary. I made 
up a simp le cell for us to consider these properties in, one with a long, and what with 
a short, nothing else. I wasn't trying to represent any particular organism. And I'll 
pick up on a couple of other things. I just want to quickly mention something. Since 
I've seen you, I flew out to San Diego, gave a ta lk yesterday morning at a major 
meeting, hopped on a plane, got back at midnight, and here I am aga in. 

As part of being a scientist, come teacher, at a place like MIT, you guys tend not to 
see, but my research life goes on while I'm teaching. And I just want to briefly 
mention one thing I talked about yesterday, because just in my own life it captures a 
coup le of things that I've been trying to tell you, that the textbook is not the ultimate 
authority. 

That's just what we think up until today. A new finding to change the way you think 
about things, and what I'm  telling you, and some of your frustrated at, that I'm not 
just parroting back the textbook is because this  is the way it is. If you guys are going 
to be leaders in whatever field you're in, you're going to be dea ling w ith this process 
of shifting sands as we gain new knowledge. So, in  fact what I was ta lking about has 
some relationship to the cell cycle that I talked about. 

Lee Hartwell particularly helped us understand that there is what's ca lled a G1 
phase, which you could think of as a preparation for DNA synthesis for what's known 
as the S-phase where DNA synthesis actually occurs. And now, you're at 4N. You've 
doubled the DNA content, and there's G2 where  it cleans up from S-phase, gets 

ready for mitosis, and mitosis is when you, then, separate the daughter chromatids, 
go back to 2N, and then ultimately the cell divides. 

And we are back to 2N. And when we were talking about DNA replication, I told you 
how replicative DNA polymerases test for Watson-Crick shape, and remember that 
little movie I showed you where they flipped the base pair into a very narrow slot in 
the protein, and they check that it's there. And they sa id at that time, that's why 
polymerases have a problem when they hit a lesion such as a thymine dimer that we 
get if we go out in the sun. 

And then one of the recent pieces of excitement in the DNA repa ir field that I work 
in, was the d iscovery of a whole class of translesion DNA polymerases that have very 
flexible, active sites and we are ab le to copy over a  lesion. Right at this point, you 
will find  in the literature all sorts of reviews about polymerase switching, where 
people are envisioning the rep licative polymerase coming a long. 

It hits a lesion, gets stuck. It recruits one of these translesion polymerases that 
comes in, cop ies of the lesion; it switches back to the replicative polymerase, and 
then it goes. And there are reviews like that coming out in the literature. So, one of 
the genes that's needed for this sort of error prone kind of translesion synthesis in 
yeast and in humans is a gene ca lled  rev-1?. 

You don't have to know this for the exam, this b it. But if you knock out the function 
of that gene, the yeast aren't mutated by UV or chemicals anymore. So, you know  it 
has an essential function somehow in this process of translesion synthesis. So, one 
of our big surprises was I was trying it. We were trying to actually fish out partners 
that might interact with it cause we thought it would be regulated. 

And we were surprised. The experiments revealed something we hadn't expected. 
We found out that this protein that was critical for mutagenesis was extremely 
strongly cell cycle regulated. Well, g iven the reviews I've told you, or if somebody 
were writing a textbook today, this is what they would tell you: polymerase switching 
during S-phase. So you might have thought it would be high and S-phase, but it 
isn't. 

We can barely detect it during S-phase. But instead, the rev-1  levels are at least 50 
times in the G2M phase. Actua lly, it goes right through this part of the cell cycle, 50 
times what they are during S-phase. And so, there's a couple of possib ilities right 
now. Either these very tiny amounts that are doing S-phase are what everybody 
thinks and current models would pred ict: you're getting polymerase sw itching. 

And it makes 50  fold more during this phase for something else. If so, I don't know 
what that is. The other possib ility is that we have to rethink our model, and that it 
isn't polymerase sw itching during  replication. Actually,  the replication fork just keeps 
moving, and it leaves behind little messes. And when the cell is busy starting to line 
up chromosomes, and even while it's pulling them apart, that's when this translesion 
synthesis stuff comes in, and it cleans up the damage. 

Now, I don't know what the right answer is. That was one of the things I was ta lking 
about yesterday morning. But it's an example of how something that you guys can 
now hopefully at least understand in principle is being debated  right now. And the 
find ing from my lab changed the way I'd been thinking about it at least. I can now 
see another very real possibility. 

So, just to move on, so we are going back to Mendel now, who d id an aw ful lot more 
than I told you. A  few of you thought it was pretty frustrating and it had all that. But 
Mendel was doing other things. You already know what he could do. He knew how to 
do crosses. He knew how  to count. And he could think, which was rea lly important. 
And he's saw ratios instead of just numbers. 

So it was another class of experiments that he could do, and that was he could do a 
cross where he looked at more than one trait at once. And he d idn't have all that 
many options for things he could do, but he did what are known as dihybrid crosses, 
where he followed two traits at once. And I showed you some of the tra its that he 
stud ied. In  fact, that p icture I showed you is actually a cross that we can think of 
right now. 

He's got smooth, and yellow, wrinkled, and green, and yellow, and you'll see them in 
all four combinations. So, an examp le of the kind of cross that Mendel carried out, 
then, was he took smooth yellow, which actua lly is the dominant allele, and both, 
which he learned from his other crosses. And he crossed it with wrinkled green, 
which I'll represent as a little s, little s, little y, little y, where he previously knew the 
little s and little y alleles, the wrinkled and green were the recessive alleles. 

And then, the F1 generation, wouldn't be surprising to you at this point, I think, that 
they were a ll smooth, yellow. And, they all were Ss Yy. And if you think about the 
possible gametes you get out of this, you could only get a big S, b ig Y out of this 
one, and little s, little y out of that one. So if they came together, it would have to be 
that. So then, he self-crossed the F1, and what he got out of that was the kind of 
mixture of things that he saw there. 

He saw smooth yellow, smooth green, wrinkled yellow, and wrinkled green. In doing 
the same kind of experiments that we ta lked about before, he counted them, he 
looked to see if he saw characteristic ratios. He did. The ratios he saw were 9:3:3:1. 
So, I think we know how his head worked at this point. He tried to figure out  if he 
could expla in these results by the kind of model that he was develop ing where 
hereditary information came in, in particles. 

And he could. But he had to make a critical assumption. And if you've just seen the 
next square I'm going to draw, without rea liz ing the assumption underlies it, then 
you've missed a great dea l of his thinking. And that was that the two genes assort, 
or the two traits anyway, because he d idn't know they were genes yet, 
independently. 

And the way we could see that would be to think about what were the kind of 
gametes that you could make from those F1s. So, we could get a big S and a b ig Y 
from here, or a big S and a little y, or a little s and a big Y, or a little s and a little y. 
And, since this is selfing, it's the same thing. So I won't fill this whole thing in, but 
we get two S's, two b ig Y's here. Down here we'd have  little s, little y  like that. 

I'll fill in a coup le up here where we've got big S, big S, big Y, and a  little Y. Here we 
have big S, big S, but two little Y's. Here we'd have b ig S, little s, big Y little y. And 
over here we'd have big S,  little S, two little y's. So, if you were to make out a table 
or a chart like this that showed the phenotypes, you'll find that all of these look w ild 
type, we can see it here. However, this one would be smooth. 

But it's got the two a lleles. So it would be green. This one would be smooth and 
yellow. And this, again, would be smooth but green. And down on the corner it is the 
wrinkled green. And if you follow that out, draw out the rest of that, you'll discover 
there the 9:3:3:1 ratios. That was what Mendel observed in a ll of his experiments. 
But he wasn't particularly bothered by it because he'd shown particulate information. 

The fact they assorted randomly wasn't an issue. However, that was before people 
knew about the chromosomes, which we spent quite a b it of time talking about the 
other day. As I sa id, when people saw those chromosomes that gave rise to what's 
known as the chromosoma l theory of  inheritance. And what was interesting about 
chromosoma l theory of  inheritance was that it predicted a d ifferent outcome 
depending on whether the tra its you were studying were encoded by genes on the 
same chromosome or by genes on d ifferent chromosomes. 

Now, as it happened, what I think Mendel did was he found traits that were well 
behaved and he could study. And those all happened to be on separate 
chromosomes. So, his results d idn't d isclose this issue that was ra ised by the 
discovery of chromosomes. The chromosomal theory of inheritance gives, as I said, 
predicts d ifferent outcomes depending whether things are on the same or different 
chromosomes. 

So let's consider that by taking the F1. So, say they are on separate chromosomes. 
And let's take the F1 from the previous cross over here. So, b ig S., little s, big Y, 
little y, and then we'll cross  it with the homozygous recessive parent. That was a 
cross that I mentioned the first lecture was very important. It's  important enough 
that it's g iven a specia l name. It's ca lled a test across. 

Well, here we are using it here. Well what are the possible outcomes that could come 
from this sort of thing? Well, I think the way you could think about it most easily is, 
what kind of gametes or sex cells could we get out of this? Well,  from here we could 
get a big S and a b ig Y. Or, we could get a big S. and the little y, a little S and a big 
Y, or a little S and a little y. 

So, we could get four different types of sex cells. The gametes we can get out of this 
side, there's only one type. So,  if we start combining those, I think you can see what 
the outcome would be. It's so simp le. We don't even need to draw out the square. If 
we had big S, big Y over, they're a ll going to be over. Well actua lly, I'll draw up this 
way because I think it's a little easier to see. So, there would be four possible things 
that would come out of this test cross. 

This would be the smooth and yellow. Here would be, what have I done wrong here? 
No, this is right. This should be smooth and green. This would be wrinkled and 
yellow. And this would be wrinkled and green. And, do you see what the ratio would 
be? It would be 1:1:1:1 because we have an equal probab ility of making any of 
those. And, I'm going to rearrange these because that way that it'll help us think 
about it, this is one of the types that we've found in the original cross. 

That's a parental phenotype, smooth and yellow. It was one of the parents up there. 
This is the other one that  looks  like one of the orig inal parents. So, I can d ivide these 
into parental or nonparental phenotypes. These are 1:1, and then these others were 
ones where the progeny differed from the parent. And they're a ll 1:1:1:1. Now, 
that's what the chromosomal theory of inheritance would pred ict if they were on 
separate chromosomes. 

That's what Mendel saw when he was doing his crosses. What  if they were on the 
same chromosome? So, we are going to have to go back to the origina l cross now to 
think this one through. So, what Mendel started with was a smooth, yellow parent. 
So that was SYSY. But because these are on the same chromosome, I'm going to 
depict them this way so we can see they're going to travel as a unit. So that was 
then crossed w ith the wrinkled green, which would be a little s, little y in each case. 

This should be F1. In this case they w ill be all smooth and yellow. The recessive 
tra its d isappear, but this time they're only. What the progeny will have, they w ill 
have gotten one of the possib le a lleles from this one, which would be the SY on the 
same chromosome, and one from the other parent, the little s, little y again on the 
same chromosome and one from the other parent, the little s and y, aga in, on the 
same chromosome. 

So now if you start to ask, what will happen if I do a test cross, you're going to get a 
different outcome. So here's the test cross in this case. So, we've got this F1. It's 
smooth and yellow, but  it's actually at the chromosoma l level now. It's like this, and 
we're crossing it with the homozygous recessive parent that's now going to look  like 
that. So if you think through, what kind of gametes could we get out of this? Well, 
there's only two possibilities. 

We could get this one or this one. And over here, the kind of gametes we could get, 
there's only one type. So, what are we going to get out of this cross? What we'll end 
up getting is big SY, over the  little sy, or little sy over the  little sy like that. That's 
smooth and yellow, wrinkled and green, the ratio of these 1:1. But you see the 
difference from what we saw before? These are the parental phenotypes. 

The chromosomal theory of inheritance doesn't predict that you will get, or it pred icts 
that you will not get the nonparental phenotypes. So,  if you wanted to d istinguish 
between these two hypotheses, and  figure out where your genes were, you'd do the 
experiment. And what happened when this was done, aga in, what often happens in 
science, you think you've got  it stra ightened out. You got hypothesis A and 
hypothesis B, and you do experiment planning to do the scientific method and show 
it. 

And you get a  result that isn't what you expected with either model. And that's in 
fact what happened in this case. And it led to the d iscovery of genetic recombination. 
And to show you actua lly the experiments where that was discovered, I'm going to 
switch to another w idely used genetic model, which is the Drosophila melanogaster, 
or the fruit fly, which you see in the summer around rotting fruit. Or if you're in the 
biology building, one is apt to land on your sandwich because there's just a  few 
stragglers that get out of the Drosophila genetics labs. 

But the one thing you can see from this is the eyes, pretty cool. It's got red. The wild 
type is a  red eye, and the body's brown. And, you can see the red eyes. If you look 
at a fruit fly carefully, you'll be able to see, the summer if you take a look, you'll see 
that they have red eyes. So, they've been a very useful model organism for genetics 
partly because they grow pretty fast and they are easy to hand le in a lab. 

And so, I'll introduce you to a couple of features. So, the wild type you find in nature 
is a brown body. We'll call it a p lus, and it has normal wings, and which I'll refer to 
as p lus. And some mutant phenotypes that geneticists have been able to find is a 

black body which I'll refer to as little b. And vestigial wings, which I'll refer to as VG. 
So, these are fa irly easy to score. They look like little tiny wings. 

It's fa irly easy if you're crossing Drosophila, and looking at progeny to go through 
and score, what color are their eyes? And do they have ordinary wings or little 
wings? So, this is the kind of cross that was carried out. We are going to sw itch now 
to an organism  that has ma le and fema le. Up until now, p lants are both. They make 
pollen, and they have the eggs that are going to develop into the seeds once they're 
fertilized. 

But, Drosophila are more like us. They come in males and fema les. So, we're going 
to have to specify which is which. And I think most of you are probably familiar with 
this terminology. This  is the symbol geneticists use for female. And this is the one 
that is used for male. So, in this case, let's set up exactly the same kind of thing that 
we start here. We're going to cross a homozygous parent versus a homozygous 
recessive parent. 

That's just exactly the kind of thing we have up here. But I'm going  to do at this 
time using Drosophila genetics speak. And so, we'll be taking fema le whose w ild type 
for both tra its, we're going to cross with a male that's homozygous recessive for both 
tra its. This is the way Drosophila geneticists tend to represent this kind of thing. So 
it's exactly the same kind of cross we got before. And at this point, what we get out 
of the F1, it shouldn't be news for you. 

You can see genetica lly what it's going to be. They'll have to get one allele from 
here, one allele from there. So, by definition, the only possibility that you can get out 
of this, the F1s, will all have one allele dominant, and one recessive allele just like up 
there. And this w ill be, since the wild type is the dominant allele, this will be brown 
and normal, and norma l w ings. 

And then, at this point they then will set up a test cross, exactly the same idea. 
We're going to take the F1. And in this case, we'll take a female whose got this, and 
we'll cross her w ith a ma le who is homozygous recessive. So that will be b lack over 
black, and vestigial over vestig ial. And out of this, there are four possib ilities. We can 
get parenta l phenotypes. So, there will be, from that, black over, if you  look to the 
various comb inations of how these things could go together, you'll find we can get 
vestigia l plus. 

Or, we can get b lack over black, and vestigia l over vestig ial. For example, this one, 
coming  from those two getting together, and  this one coming from this one and this 
one getting together. So this is just exactly the same kind of thing we've done but 
done using Drosophila traits. And then, nonparental, so now we get, for example, 
black over black, and vestig ial over plus, black but norma l wings, or we could have 
black over plus, vestigia l over vestigial, which would be a brown body, but with 
vestigia l wings. 

So, if we were trying to do this kind of cross, we are doing this kind of cross, and we 
are trying to see what the outcome would be. Mendel, every trait assorts 
independently would pred ict the 1:1:1:1. And the chromosomal theory of inheritance 
would pred ict we'd get 1:1 here, and we wouldn't see those at all. Instead, what 
happened when this experiment was done where numbers that d idn't really fit. 

This part works pretty well. These are numbers from an experiment of this type. So 
these are pretty close to 1:1. That's OK. That fits w ith both of the models. The 
surprise is over here where there is 206 to 185. So, these are in the ba llpark of 1:1. 
But what you can see is the result is not what was predicted by the model. This is 
the kind of thing  I've sort of been trying to tell you through the course. 

It keeps happening in biology. It's not a QED sort of thing where you can work it out 
by logic. Very often, you do an experiment, you get a result that doesn't fit w ithin 
your current framework. And then you have to go back and  redo your thinking. So 
what was going on here, as it turned out, and it all got sorted out, was scientists had 
just d iscovered genetic recomb ination. And here is where, what was going on. 

So when we talked about Meiosis I, and we had duplicated the DNA, so we now had 
two chromatids, and I showed you the chiasma when it was drying, it looked sort of 
like this. And, I sa id that you a lways saw these physical attachments that once the 
homologous pa irs were dup licated, they would a lways be in contact. And I sa id there 
was actually a physical interaction going on there. Well what was going on  in there 
was an exchange, a recombination event at the DNA level that's just exactly 
equiva lent to what was happening when I showed you the phage cross. 

Remember, we had a phage cross, and if we got a recomb ination in between the two 
genes, then we could get progeny that were a mixture of the two tra its. So, if we 
were p lus p lus, for example, these are on the same chromosome. And the other one 
is like this, b lack, vestigia l, black, and vestig ial. If we get a genetic recomb ination 
going on here where these two  intersect and recombine in between these two genes, 
what you get out of that, then, is this chromatid is still the same. 

It's got both wild type alleles. But in this case, now, the b lack allele has moved  from 
here to the tip of this one, pairing it with that. And the other chromatid over here, 
the other homologous pair, now has the plus together with the vestigia l here and 
then here. So, if you, then, draw out the possible gametes one will look like one 
parent. One will look  like the other parent. 

This one can give rise to a nonparental phenotype in a test cross. And that one can 
give rise to a nonparenta l phenotype in a test cross. And that's what's going on in 
this experiment I've described. But the nice thing about this since this sort of thing is 
happening is one can ca lculate, then, a recombination frequency in just the same 
way that we calculated it when we were doing phage cross. 

And in this case, it was the recombinants, which in this context I'm referring to the 
nonparenta ls, the recombinants over the tota l of the parenta l types and the 
nonparenta l. So in this case, this would be 206 plus 185 over 965 p lus 944 plus 206 
plus 185. And if I haven't b lown the arithmetic,  that would be a  recombination 
frequency of 17%. Now, we were back ta lking about that phage cross. 

Remember, we did a pa ir of crosses between gene one and two, and between two 
and three, and then we were trying to  figure out if they were in the  linear order, how 
we could exp lain it. And we fina lly worked out the order by crossing allele one and 
three. And we made a little genetic map that could show the order of gene 1, 2, and 
3, based on nothing more than the recombination frequency. So, that's exactly what 
people were able to do by this kind of measurement. 

And that, then, led to the generation of chromosome maps. This  is a publication from 
Science in 1994. This is before the human genome was done. And they were 
mapping a kind of genetic marker that we'll ta lk about when we do restriction 
enzymes. But they were able to associate it w ith banding patterns they had seen on 
the chromosome. 

This is the sort of thing that cytologists saw, and as scientists were working this out, 
then they were able to associate these genetic maps of loci, and begin to associate 
them with the physical maps of banding patterns in chromosomes. Now we have the 
sort of ultimate genetic map, which is the sequence of the human chromosomes. So 
now we know exactly, to the base pa ir, how far different genes are. 

Part of the way that the human genome was assemb led from all these little tiny 
fragments of DNA that were sequenced were taking advantage of these kind of maps 
that told the scientists assembling all these little fragments of DNA sequence what 
order they had to be in, what part of the chromosome they were on, and that kind of 
thing. There is, this, then, leads us, though, to other issues since I've now started to 
talk about chromosomes. 

And one more thing, let me just say before I leave this. So, from this kind of thing, if 
the recomb ination frequency is much less than 50%, then they're on the same 
chromosome. And the word geneticists use to describe this is they say genes are 
linked. If the recombination frequency is 50%, then they are on different 
chromosomes. At this point,  it's just random assortment. 

You go one way or the other so you get a number of 50% if you do this kind of 
calculation. And these are referred to as unlinked. And those of you who are thinking 
about it can probably imagine that there might be a problem, that if you had a very 
long chromosome, so the two genes you are studying were very far apart, you might 
get so many recombination events  in between that it would beg in to look, the 
recombination  frequency might come close to 50%. 

And you would perhaps have a difficult time  in that genetic cross telling whether the 
genes are rea lly unlinked. They were on separate chromosomes, or they were linked 
but very far apart. So this kind of thing could be a little hard to resolve that kind of 
situation. But there are other things you can do  to look at that. So, the 
chromosomes we've been talking about are what are known as autosomes. 

These are identica l pairs. But there's an exception. And those are the genes that are 
involved in sex determination. It's the chromosomes that are involved in sex 
determination. These are known as heterosomes. And,  they're on this picture that I 
showed you where they used this technique of chromosome pa inting to show it. You 
can see how a ll these autosomes are in identical pairs. 

But this is a male, obviously, because there's the Y-chromosome, and there is an X. 
If you're a fema le, you'd have two cop ies of the X, something I think most of you 
know. So, if we think about how this works in humans, females have two X's, and 
males have an X and a Y. In Drosophila, the fruit fly, it's the same thing. Ma les have 
two X. Fema les have two X's, and ma les have an XY. 

But there isn't anything mag ic  in nature about fema les having two of the same, and 
males having one of each because in b irds where it's different enough they use 
different notation. The fema les have one of each. And let me make sure I got my 

notation right. I think it's ZZ, excuse me. And the fema les have one of each. So, 
nature tends to use these differences as far as sex determination. 

And this, then, poses a new kind of prob lem. And that is, what would happen if you 
were doing a cross, and the allele that you are studying happened to be on a sex 
chromosome instead of one of these? You might guess that since fema les have two 
of one and ma les have one of each that I would not give the results that are 
predicted by what we've talked about so far. 

And so, this led to the d iscovery of what's known as sex linkage. And that's 
important. And in  fact, as you'll see in a minute, affects stuff that we are familiar 
with in our lives. I want to just quickly introduce you to this, and show you how  it 
was d iscovered. It was done by Thomas Morgan in 1910 actua lly, this discovery. 
What he was doing was he took a white eyed male, crossed it w ith a  red eyed  female 
wild type, and yet the expected  result that the F1s were all red eye. 

But then when he took the F1 fema le, which was red, and crossed it with a red eyed 
male, you got something that was very puzzling at the time. The fema les were a ll 
red. The ma les, half of them had red eyes, and half of them had white eyes. If you 
followed the logic up until now, where you try to work this out, you would find that 
you couldn't generate this pattern by the stuff that we've ta lked about now. 

So once aga in, this led to the need to create a new model, something that expanded 
our thinking. So, the way the thinking went was, well, there must be something to 
do with the sex of the fruit fly in this. And so, here was the hypothesis, and that was 
that the white eyed ma le had this genotype. They had an a llele that caused the white 
eyeness. 

But it was located on the X chromosome so that the ma le would have had a Y 
chromosome paired with that. And, the red eyed female used in the first cross would 
have a w ild type a llele on both X chromosomes. And so, if that were the model, 
what's going to happen to them when we do this cross that we've described here? 
Well, let's think it through. So, we've got female whose X plus. 

We're crossing w ith the male who 's got the X with the white a llele over the Y. So, the 
females can either be, they'll get an X p lus XW, and the males, yeah, right. The 
males are going to get, they w ill get this allele for Y. So now,  if he takes us red eyed 
female, that was the F1 from the cross up here, which will be this, and crossed w ith 
a red eyed ma le. Now, that means the ma le has to have the good allele. 

What are we going  to get? Well, for the fema les  in this cross, we've got a couple of 
possibilities. This one, we could get just the w ild type fema le back, or we could get 
this one pairing w ith this one, which will give us this. So, these are a ll red that fit. 
But,  the males, then, if you see what happens, they have to have, each have to have 
a Y, and  then they can either get this allele or that a llele. 

If they get this a llele, they're red. If this a llele, they're white. If you stand back and 
look at that, you w ill see that is the outcome that was observed. Females were a ll 
red. The ma les are half red, ha lf white. Well, this is a characteristic of, this would be 
an X-linked trait. And  I want to just point out one thing. This female, excuse me, 
wrong fema le. This female here is what's referred to as a carrier. 

She's got this a llele that causes a white guy, but she's not expressing it herself. But 
she's ab le to transmit it to her sons. And when she has progeny, on average, half of 
her sons w ill have the tra it. And now, X- linked traits, there are a number of them 
that we know about. Some of you may know hemophilia. Queen Victoria was a 
carrier of this gene causing hemophilia, where there is a problem w ith the clotting 
mechanism. 

And if you get a cut, then you can b leed a lot. So, some of her sons had this. A more 
common one, which has to app ly to some peop le in this room,  is red-green color 
blindness. If you're a ma le, you have a much higher probability of being colorblind 
because it's an X-linked tra it. And I want to just close by showing you how human 
geneticists think about the sort of thing. And we have to think about things 
differently if we are doing human genetics because as most of you know, I think a ll 
of us would be very uncooperative subjects in a kind of genetic cross that a  fruit fly 
geneticist or most geneticists would like to have us do, in which we'd be put in a 
cage w ith a member of the other sex and say, mate. 

That was your choice in life. Well, that would be a d ifferent kind of existence for us 
all. So, human geneticists don't have that luxury of having pure breeding strains and 
doing controlled crosses. We all have very strong feelings about the kind of crosses 
that we want to engage in. And so, what they have to do, they have to make use 
with what they find. And they use a coup le of symbols here that I'll just show you. 

They look at ped igrees, and then they look for patterns. And, they use a little 
shorthand  for doing this. Males are squares, which I don't know if there's any 
symbolism to that or not, but if they are affected they show it as a shaded square, 
and unaffected as an open symbol. So, affected males are solid squares. Affected 
females are solid circles. 

So, let's take a look at the sort of pedigree that human geneticists might see. And 
let's consider something. Let's consider red-green color b lindness, which is an X-
linked trait. So, let's take a male, which there is probably one in this room at least, 
maybe more, who have this. So, since the colorblindness trait  is on the X 
chromosome since he's a male, the other pa ir will be Y. That means if you're a ma le 
and you've got it, you're going to d isp lay the phenotypes. 

So this is, George, let's say, who is colorblind. They leave a lot of the romance out of 
these things, as you'll see, who had progeny w ith Mary. Let's say, they got married 
after they graduated from MIT. It was very happy. They had a, let's see, son. He had 
to get the Y from dad. So, he had to get a good allele from his mother. But they also 
had a daughter, and she had to get the color b lindness allele on an X chromosome 
because the dad only had one of them, and then a good one from her mom. 

So at this point, everybody's norma l. But you'll notice, this daughter has this tra it of 
being a carrier because even though she doesn't display the trait herself, she's got it 
in her genome. So, let's say, this son marries a woman who doesn't have any 
colorb lindness allele. So, if we have,  let's say, a daughter, and a son, a daughter, 
and a son, this is not much happening over on the part of the ped igree. Everybody 
would be norma l. 

Yeah, did I miss something? Pardon? Oh, it's over Y. Excuse me, yep, I'm going too 
fast here. Over Y, here we go. I don't need to  introduce any genetic abnormalities on 
top of what we're already trying to do here. This is complicated enough. OK, so what 

happens, let's say then that the daughter that married a guy, and they had four 
children. I'm going to help us with the genetics of it, from  the geneticist, that sort of 
a perfect family in this case would be four kids representing a ll four possib ilities. 

And so, first off  let's think what would happen w ith the daughters. Well, the 
daughters could either have the colorblindness a llele paired w ith this one. Or, they 
could get a wild type allele with this one. So actually, I'd better put this in. So this is 
a daughter. So this would be CB over plus, or it could be plus over plus. This one 
would, again, be a carrier. 

Now, w ith the sons, they're both going to get the Y since they're male. But there's a 
possibility of either getting the good a llele, which means he'll be unaffected. But,  if 
you get the other one, he'll be affected. Now, this would be sort of a typ ica l 
pedigree. And you rea lize, depending on the number of kids, you might or might not 
see this. But this, you're going to get to do some more of these and to do some 
other traits. 

But let me just sort of point out,  if you're a human geneticist, what you would 
recognize here, the trait's more frequent in males. The frequency of color b lindness 
is about 8% on the X chromosome. So, if you're a fema le, you've got to have two of 
them. So that means, you've got 0.64% because you've got to get two together. It's 
a much smaller probability. The tra it skips a generation, We often say. 

You see it here. You see here. But you don't see it  in between, and that's because 
you have this carrier. The affected males don't transmit to their sons because what 
they give to their sons is the Y. So, they can't g ive them the colorblindness thing. 
And then, the heterozygous fema les who are carriers w ill transmit the trait to their 
sons about half the time. And that's a pattern that a human geneticist would look 
for. 

And they'd say, ah-ha, it must be an X- linked trait. And you'll see  in your prob lem 
sets and recitation sections are the patterns. OK, I'll see you on Friday.
