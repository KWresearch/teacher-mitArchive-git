1 
00:00:00 --> 00:00:04 
I am a professor in the Biology 
Department at MIT. 

2 
00:00:04 --> 00:00:09 
And I will be co-teaching this 
course with Penny Chisholm who is a 

3 
00:00:09 --> 00:00:14 
professor in the Department of Civil 
and Environmental Engineering, 

4 
00:00:14 --> 00:00:19 
as well as a professor in the 
Biology Department. 

5 
00:00:19 --> 00:00:24 
As well, Penny was recently 
featured in the journal Nature. 

6 
00:00:24 --> 00:00:29 
She is a very well-known 
oceanographer who has become 

7 
00:00:29 --> 00:00:34 
deservedly famous for discovering a 
very small bacterium that's capable 

8 
00:00:34 --> 00:00:39 
of carrying out photosynthesis. 
For many years oceanographers used 

9 
00:00:39 --> 00:00:43 
filters whose holes were big enough 
that this bacterium went through. 

10 
00:00:43 --> 00:00:47 
And so when they were doing their 
studies of the ocean and how the 

11 
00:00:47 --> 00:00:51 
biomass that was there and all the 
fluxes and so on, 

12 
00:00:51 --> 00:00:55 
they didn't know this organism 
existed which can form up to 50% of 

13 
00:00:55 --> 00:01:00 
the biomass in parts of the ocean. 
So Penny is really a wonderful 

14 
00:01:00 --> 00:01:05 
lecturer, a wonderful person, 
and she'll be teaching the component 

15 
00:01:05 --> 00:01:10 
of 7.014 which deals with ecology 
and the environment. 

16 
00:01:10 --> 00:01:15 
And this is a section of 7. 
14 that makes it different from the 

17 
00:01:15 --> 00:01:20 
other two versions, 
7.012 and 7.013. So for me 

18 
00:01:20 --> 00:01:25 
personally this is an absolutely 
wonderful and exciting opportunity 

19 
00:01:25 --> 00:01:30 
to be able to teach this 
Introductory Biology course. 

20 
00:01:30 --> 00:01:34 
For some of you I know that biology 
is going to either be a major part 

21 
00:01:34 --> 00:01:38 
of your career or quite possibly, 
even if you're in engineering or 

22 
00:01:38 --> 00:01:43 
something else, 
you will find yourselves working 

23 
00:01:43 --> 00:01:47 
with a biological system. 
You can see that happening all over 

24 
00:01:47 --> 00:01:52 
campus these days that more and more 
engineering departments are finding 

25 
00:01:52 --> 00:01:56 
that they're working on problems 
that come from biology or have a 

26 
00:01:56 --> 00:02:01 
biological component. 
I'm sure there are at least a few 

27 
00:02:01 --> 00:02:05 
of you here who are only here 
because it's a required course and 

28 
00:02:05 --> 00:02:10 
you might well wish you 
were somewhere else. 

29 
00:02:10 --> 00:02:14 
However, I will do my best to try to 
communicate to you why you need to 

30 
00:02:14 --> 00:02:19 
know some biology, 
too. I think most of you know you 

31 
00:02:19 --> 00:02:23 
can hardly pick up a newspaper these 
days without running into something 

32 
00:02:23 --> 00:02:28 
that demands a knowledge of biology, 
something about stem cells, 

33 
00:02:28 --> 00:02:33 
something about cloning humans, 
something about a new drug, lots of 

34 
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37 
things having to do with biological 
affects on the environment 

35 
00:02:37 --> 00:02:42 
and so on. 
You're also going to be confronted 

36 
00:02:42 --> 00:02:46 
with decisions about your health, 
about the health of your loved ones 

37 
00:02:46 --> 00:02:51 
concerning cancer, 
concerning whether a child might 

38 
00:02:51 --> 00:02:55 
have birth defects, 
all sort of issues that will affect 

39 
00:02:55 --> 00:03:00 
your personal lives that demand an 
understanding of biology. 

40 
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04 
So I feel with some passion that 
whether you think you're going to 

41 
00:03:04 --> 00:03:08 
need biology in your professional 
career or not, 

42 
00:03:08 --> 00:03:13 
everyone in this institution needs 
some understanding of biology to 

43 
00:03:13 --> 00:03:17 
just live their ordinary lives. 
I also think as MIT students you're 

44 
00:03:17 --> 00:03:21 
going to be looked at, 
as you go through your lives, 

45 
00:03:21 --> 00:03:26 
as people who are knowledgeable 
about science and engineering. 

46 
00:03:26 --> 00:03:30 
And you'll be asked questions that 
go far beyond your immediate 

47 
00:03:30 --> 00:03:35 
area of expertise. 
And again I think that's another 

48 
00:03:35 --> 00:03:39 
reason for needing to know some of 
biology. Anyway, 

49 
00:03:39 --> 00:03:44 
it's an absolutely wonderful time to 
teach biology because things have 

50 
00:03:44 --> 00:03:48 
just been exploding over the last 
two or three decades and things are 

51 
00:03:48 --> 00:03:53 
moving faster than ever. 
And another wonderful thing about 

52 
00:03:53 --> 00:03:57 
teaching biology is that MIT is an 
absolutely marvelous place 

53 
00:03:57 --> 00:04:02 
to teach it. 
Just to sort of drive this home, 

54 
00:04:02 --> 00:04:07 
in the Biology Department alone 
there are four Nobel laureates who 

55 
00:04:07 --> 00:04:12 
got honored for critical discoveries 
in biology. Gobin Khorana who is 

56 
00:04:12 --> 00:04:17 
just down the hall from me 
synthesized the first gene. 

57 
00:04:17 --> 00:04:22 
It was an extraordinary feat of 
synthesis of organic chemistry 

58 
00:04:22 --> 00:04:27 
synthesizing DNA. 
When I was an undergrad I was a 

59 
00:04:27 --> 00:04:32 
chemistry major but I had to take an 
introductory biology course. 

60 
00:04:32 --> 00:04:36 
And at that point the DNA wasn't 
mentioned in the high school course. 

61 
00:04:36 --> 00:04:40 
So the first time that I heard 
about DNA was in my introductory 

62 
00:04:40 --> 00:04:44 
biology course. 
And that determined by career 

63 
00:04:44 --> 00:04:48 
direction. I thought that was such 
an interesting molecule that I 

64 
00:04:48 --> 00:04:52 
wanted to work on it and I talked 
myself into one of the labs in 

65 
00:04:52 --> 00:04:56 
Ottawa, Canada where I grew up that 
was trying to synthesize DNA, 

66 
00:04:56 --> 00:05:00 
synthesize pieces of the gene. 
And, as it turned out later, 

67 
00:05:00 --> 00:05:05 
competing unsuccessfully with my now 
colleague Gobin Khorana. 

68 
00:05:05 --> 00:05:09 
Susumu Tonegawa got a Nobel prize 
for discovering the amazing 

69 
00:05:09 --> 00:05:14 
molecular operations that underlie 
the diversity of the immune system. 

70 
00:05:14 --> 00:05:18 
Your immune system has the capacity 
to recognize viruses and bacteria, 

71 
00:05:18 --> 00:05:23 
all sorts of different pathogens, 
including molecules. 

72 
00:05:23 --> 00:05:27 
It can recognize molecules that 
haven't even ever been synthesized 

73 
00:05:27 --> 00:05:32 
in the history of life. 
And we'll talk towards the end of 

74 
00:05:32 --> 00:05:36 
the course about the way that 
happens. And you'll see why Susumu 

75 
00:05:36 --> 00:05:40 
got his Nobel prize. 
Phil Sharp got his for discovering 

76 
00:05:40 --> 00:05:45 
RNA splicing completely 
unanticipated component of the very 

77 
00:05:45 --> 00:05:49 
heart of molecular biology. 
And then Bob Horvitz who was of 

78 
00:05:49 --> 00:05:54 
pure mind when he started at MIT at 
the same time and our labs were side 

79 
00:05:54 --> 00:05:58 
by side for many years, 
got his Nobel prize in 2002 for 

80 
00:05:58 --> 00:06:02 
discovering a phenomenon, 
the general term is “programmed” 

81 
00:06:02 --> 00:06:07 
cell death. 
And it plays all sorts of important 

82 
00:06:07 --> 00:06:12 
roles in biology from sculpting the 
shapes of organs and tissues. 

83 
00:06:12 --> 00:06:17 
We initially have webs when we're 
developing between our fingers, 

84 
00:06:17 --> 00:06:22 
and those go away because of the 
programmed cell death that the cells 

85 
00:06:22 --> 00:06:27 
that were making the web disappear. 
And another role of that is prevent 

86 
00:06:27 --> 00:06:32 
cancer. That if cells sense that 
something is very messed up they 

87 
00:06:32 --> 00:06:37 
have a sort of suicide program that 
would make them destroy themselves. 

88 
00:06:37 --> 00:06:41 
And if that doesn't happen those 
cells could go on and become more 

89 
00:06:41 --> 00:06:46 
and more abnormal and eventually 
turn into an invasive cancer. 

90 
00:06:46 --> 00:06:50 
Anyway, there's a picture of Bob 
when the institute was celebrating 

91 
00:06:50 --> 00:06:55 
his Nobel prize. 
He was getting a congratulatory 

92 
00:06:55 --> 00:07:00 
kiss from Martha Constantine-Paton, 
also a professor in the Biology 

93 
00:07:00 --> 00:07:05 
Department who happens 
to be Bob's wife. 

94 
00:07:05 --> 00:07:09 
Most of you know that the human 
genome has now been sequenced. 

95 
00:07:09 --> 00:07:14 
That was one of the huge 
undertakings and most important 

96 
00:07:14 --> 00:07:18 
undertakings in modern biology over 
the last while. 

97 
00:07:18 --> 00:07:23 
It was an incredible feat. 
Each cell has, as most of you know, 

98 
00:07:23 --> 00:07:27 
46 chromosomes. And that's a total 
of about two meters of DNA 

99 
00:07:27 --> 00:07:32 
in every human cell. 
And that two meters of DNA is 

100 
00:07:32 --> 00:07:37 
composed of about 3 million DNA base 
pairs, these letters A, 

101 
00:07:37 --> 00:07:42 
T, G and C that we'll be talking 
about as we go through the course. 

102 
00:07:42 --> 00:07:47 
So to sequence the genome you had 
to work out the sequence of the 

103 
00:07:47 --> 00:07:52 
exact run of these A, 
G, T and Cs along the backbone for 3 

104 
00:07:52 --> 00:07:57 
billion base pairs. 
And somewhere that genome encodes 

105 
00:07:57 --> 00:08:02 
somewhere between 20,000 
and 30,000 genes. 

106 
00:08:02 --> 00:08:06 
And we'll be talking about the 
proteins that are encoded by most of 

107 
00:08:06 --> 00:08:11 
those genes and their important 
roles as we go on in the course. 

108 
00:08:11 --> 00:08:15 
What some of you may not know is 
the key role that MIT played in this. 

109 
00:08:15 --> 00:08:20 
About a third of the genome was 
sequenced at the Whitehead MIT 

110 
00:08:20 --> 00:08:24 
Genome Center. 
And here are some of the robots 

111 
00:08:24 --> 00:08:29 
that were used to sequence 
that DNA. 

112 
00:08:29 --> 00:08:34 
And that sequencing effort was led 
by Eric Lander whose name some of 

113 
00:08:34 --> 00:08:39 
you may recognize because he teaches 
the fall version of 7. 

114 
00:08:39 --> 00:08:44 
12 along with Bob Weinberg. 
So here are just a few examples of 

115 
00:08:44 --> 00:08:49 
why I think it's important for you 
to understand biology regardless of 

116 
00:08:49 --> 00:08:54 
whether you're going to go on and 
use it professionally. 

117 
00:08:54 --> 00:08:59 
Most of you know one of the biggest 
challenges we face on this planet is 

118 
00:08:59 --> 00:09:04 
this AIDS epidemic. 
It's caused by a certain kind of 

119 
00:09:04 --> 00:09:10 
virus called HIV-1 that gets into 
particular cells of your immune 

120 
00:09:10 --> 00:09:16 
system that normally defends us 
against infection and destroys those. 

121 
00:09:16 --> 00:09:22 
And then people die from infections 
by other organisms that normally you 

122 
00:09:22 --> 00:09:28 
can fight off. 
It's a huge problem with vast 

123 
00:09:28 --> 00:09:33 
societal and economic implications. 
And it's one that we're still, 

124 
00:09:33 --> 00:09:37 
as a mankind still trying to deal 
with and grapple with. 

125 
00:09:37 --> 00:09:41 
Here's another example. 
Just a couple of years ago there 

126 
00:09:41 --> 00:09:45 
was the scar of anthrax. 
It's a bacterium that's very 

127 
00:09:45 --> 00:09:50 
pathogenic and kills its host fairly 
easily. It does it by making 

128 
00:09:50 --> 00:09:54 
particular toxins. 
The details shown here don't matter, 

129 
00:09:54 --> 00:09:58 
but just reminding you that this is 
something that was in the front 

130 
00:09:58 --> 00:10:03 
pages of the paper just 
a little while ago. 

131 
00:10:03 --> 00:10:07 
A couple of years ago, 
when I was teaching this, 

132 
00:10:07 --> 00:10:11 
we had the scare of the SARS virus 
that went all the way during the 

133 
00:10:11 --> 00:10:15 
course when I was teaching it from 
the initial discovery of the virus 

134 
00:10:15 --> 00:10:19 
to the actual sequencing of the 
genome which had happened by later 

135 
00:10:19 --> 00:10:23 
on in this course. 
Smallpox was a disease we thought 

136 
00:10:23 --> 00:10:27 
that we eliminated, 
but now it's come back as a 

137 
00:10:27 --> 00:10:32 
bioterrorism treat and there is 
increased study of smallpox. 

138 
00:10:32 --> 00:10:36 
It's something we have to worry 
about again. Here's another example. 

139 
00:10:36 --> 00:10:40 
This is a picture showing the start 
of a transgenic animal. 

140 
00:10:40 --> 00:10:44 
We'll talk about how this process 
goes later in the course. 

141 
00:10:44 --> 00:10:48 
And it's related also to this whole 
issue of cloning, 

142 
00:10:48 --> 00:10:52 
using the sense of the word such as 
in trying to clone a human or clone 

143 
00:10:52 --> 00:10:56 
an animal to make a genetically 
identical copy. 

144 
00:10:56 --> 00:11:00 
So you'll see there are a couple of 
different uses of the word cloning 

145 
00:11:00 --> 00:11:05 
as we go through the course. 
There's a lot of fuss in the news 

146 
00:11:05 --> 00:11:09 
and the newspapers about genetically 
modified food, 

147 
00:11:09 --> 00:11:13 
and people have different positions 
on it. Here's a case where I think 

148 
00:11:13 --> 00:11:18 
the benefit of a genetically 
modified food could hardly be argued 

149 
00:11:18 --> 00:11:22 
with. About two-thirds of the 
world's population uses rice as 

150 
00:11:22 --> 00:11:26 
their primary source of food. 
One of the problems with rice is 

151 
00:11:26 --> 00:11:31 
that it doesn't make beta-carotene. 
And beta carotene is what our bodies 

152 
00:11:31 --> 00:11:35 
take and use to make vitamin A. 
And if you have a vitamin A 

153 
00:11:35 --> 00:11:40 
deficiency people are prone to 
infection. They have immune 

154 
00:11:40 --> 00:11:45 
deficiencies in their immune system 
and blindness. 

155 
00:11:45 --> 00:11:49 
And this deficiency of vitamin A 
caused by eating rice afflicts about 

156 
00:11:49 --> 00:11:54 
400 million people worldwide. 
Well, rice is only two chemical 

157 
00:11:54 --> 00:11:59 
steps away from being able to make 
beta carotene. 

158 
00:11:59 --> 00:12:03 
This is a genetically modified 
version of rice that has those two 

159 
00:12:03 --> 00:12:07 
extra steps inserted in it. 
And you can see it's golden because 

160 
00:12:07 --> 00:12:11 
it's making beta carotene. 
If people were to eat that form of 

161 
00:12:11 --> 00:12:15 
rice then they wouldn't have this 
problem with vitamin A deficiency. 

162 
00:12:15 --> 00:12:19 
Penny Chisholm in her part of the 
course will be considering things 

163 
00:12:19 --> 00:12:23 
that are more global level. 
Here's a picture of our planet, 

164 
00:12:23 --> 00:12:27 
and there are issues that you know 
about there. This is the carbon 

165 
00:12:27 --> 00:12:32 
dioxide levels in the 
atmosphere rising. 

166 
00:12:32 --> 00:12:37 
And that's a real phenomenon. 
This shows from 1960 to 1995. 

167 
00:12:37 --> 00:12:42 
This is associated with a global 
warming that again is undeniable 

168 
00:12:42 --> 00:12:48 
that it's happening. 
You'll see stuff in the papers. 

169 
00:12:48 --> 00:12:53 
And these gases, particularly 
carbon dioxide and methane, 

170 
00:12:53 --> 00:12:59 
they're known as greenhouse gases 
are playing a role in that. 

171 
00:12:59 --> 00:12:54 
And probably mankind is playing a 
role in the production of those 

172 
00:12:54 --> 00:12:50 
gases and, hence, 
in global warming. 

173 
00:12:50 --> 00:12:45 
And Penny will talk to you a little 
more about that. 

174 
00:12:45 --> 00:12:41 
Right here at MIT Mario Molina in 
EAPS discovered the ozone hole and 

175 
00:12:41 --> 00:12:36 
got a Nobel prize for that. 
Ozone is important because it 

176 
00:12:36 --> 00:12:32 
absorbs UV, a critical component of 
ultraviolet radiation that would 

177 
00:12:32 --> 00:12:28 
damage our cells if we 
were exposed to it. 

178 
00:12:28 --> 00:12:39 
And because of the emission of 
fluorocarbons in the environment 

179 
00:12:39 --> 00:12:50 
this large hole developed over 
Antarctic. If that had spread, 

180 
00:12:50 --> 00:13:01 
it would have been a real disaster. 
And that seems to be, the efforts 

181 
00:13:01 --> 00:13:12 
to cut down the release of 
fluorocarbons seem to be helping 

182 
00:13:12 --> 00:13:23 
with that. But, 
again, Penny will have more to say. 

183 
00:13:23 --> 00:13:34 
Those of you who've lived around 
here for a little bit probably know 

184 
00:13:34 --> 00:13:45 
that the fishing industry just 
locally has had a very hard time. 

185 
00:13:45 --> 00:13:56 
There is a fishing boat just up in 
Gloucester, just up the coast less 

186 
00:13:56 --> 00:14:04 
than an hour from here. 
And part of the problems, 

187 
00:14:04 --> 00:14:08 
again, are caused by mismanagement 
of the resources where the fish have 

188 
00:14:08 --> 00:14:12 
been, stocks have been over-fished 
so some of the fisheries have come 

189 
00:14:12 --> 00:14:17 
to the point of collapse or near. 
Places such as the Grand Banks off 

190 
00:14:17 --> 00:14:21 
of Newfoundland there has been a 
collapse, and it's not at all clear 

191 
00:14:21 --> 00:14:25 
that it can be reversed and whether 
they'll be cod in large quantities 

192 
00:14:25 --> 00:14:31 
every again there. OK. 
So there a variety of ways that we 

193 
00:14:31 --> 00:14:39 
can study biology. 
And I think I'm going to begin by 

194 
00:14:39 --> 00:14:46 
outlining how we do that. 
Biology is an experimental science 

195 
00:14:46 --> 00:14:54 
and it's one of the really important 
themes that we'll run through 

196 
00:14:54 --> 00:15:00 
in this course. 
You cannot study biology by just 

197 
00:15:00 --> 00:15:04 
sitting down with a pen and paper in 
a room and thinking. 

198 
00:15:04 --> 00:15:08 
You have to get out and find out 
what's there. You need to make 

199 
00:15:08 --> 00:15:12 
observations. You need to try 
experiments. You need to formulate 

200 
00:15:12 --> 00:15:16 
hypotheses and test them and either 
modify your hypothesis or reject it 

201 
00:15:16 --> 00:15:20 
and so on. But it's a continual 
cycle of experimentation and making 

202 
00:15:20 --> 00:15:24 
hypotheses and testing. 
It's the Scientific Method at work. 

203 
00:15:24 --> 00:15:29 
But you can carry that out at 
different levels. 

204 
00:15:29 --> 00:15:39 
The very highest level would be the 
biosphere. Here's one example. 

205 
00:15:39 --> 00:15:49 
That's earth. It's here. There 
are many, many species of life that 

206 
00:15:49 --> 00:16:00 
are on there. There are many more 
than a million. 

207 
00:16:00 --> 00:16:04 
And the estimates of how many there 
are range from, 

208 
00:16:04 --> 00:16:09 
in total, 10 to the 20 million 
estimated. And one of the big 

209 
00:16:09 --> 00:16:13 
worries right at the moment is that 
as rain forests are being depleted, 

210 
00:16:13 --> 00:16:18 
parts of the world that are a rich 
source of biological diversity, 

211 
00:16:18 --> 00:16:23 
as those are disappearing we're 
losing diversity at quite a rate. 

212 
00:16:23 --> 00:16:27 
Just a couple of years ago I had a 
chance to fly over 

213 
00:16:27 --> 00:16:32 
a part of Brazil. 
And it was just scary to see from 

214 
00:16:32 --> 00:16:37 
the plane how the rain forest was 
just being cut down. 

215 
00:16:37 --> 00:16:42 
And you could just see how fast 
some of the rain forest was 

216 
00:16:42 --> 00:16:48 
disappearing, and with it many 
different types of species that only 

217 
00:16:48 --> 00:16:53 
can live there. 
One can look instead, 

218 
00:16:53 --> 00:16:58 
going down a level, at an ecosystem 
which is a particular 

219 
00:16:58 --> 00:17:06 
environment -- 

220 
00:17:06 --> 00:17:10 
-- and the species of life found in 
it. And just to give you a couple 

221 
00:17:10 --> 00:17:14 
of examples of that, 
it could be a salt marsh as shown 

222 
00:17:14 --> 00:17:18 
here. Or here's an interesting 
environment that Penny Chisholm will 

223 
00:17:18 --> 00:17:22 
tell you more about. 
This is a black smoker. 

224 
00:17:22 --> 00:17:26 
There's a vent several miles deep 
in the Pacific Ocean. 

225 
00:17:26 --> 00:17:30 
The water temperature that's 
gushing out of here is around 360 

226 
00:17:30 --> 00:17:35 
degree centigrade. 
And there's a particular community 

227 
00:17:35 --> 00:17:40 
of life that's able to grow around 
these deep vents. 

228 
00:17:40 --> 00:17:46 
And Penny will tell you more about 
that. Then going down yet another 

229 
00:17:46 --> 00:17:56 
level you can come to a population. 

230 
00:17:56 --> 00:18:07 
And this is interacting -- 

231 
00:18:07 --> 00:18:11 
-- or interbreeding organisms. 
An example might be the fiddler 

232 
00:18:11 --> 00:18:16 
crabs in a salt marsh. 
Or here we see an interesting 

233 
00:18:16 --> 00:18:20 
population. These are tube worms 
that are up to a meter or more in 

234 
00:18:20 --> 00:18:25 
length that you find down at these 
black smokers. 

235 
00:18:25 --> 00:18:34 
If we move down yet another level -- 

236 
00:18:34 --> 00:18:39 
-- we come to organisms. 
Organisms have three important 

237 
00:18:39 --> 00:18:45 
sorts of characteristics that we'll 
talk quite a bit about in this 

238 
00:18:45 --> 00:18:51 
course. They carry out metabolism 
which is the sum of all the 

239 
00:18:51 --> 00:18:57 
different chemical reactions 
necessary for life. 

240 
00:18:57 --> 00:19:07 
They undergo regulated growth -- 

241 
00:19:07 --> 00:19:12 
-- and they reproduce. 
And the sort of fundamental unit of 

242 
00:19:12 --> 00:19:17 
life that we will talk about over 
and over again in this course is 

243 
00:19:17 --> 00:19:22 
known as a cell. 
And life comes in two kinds of 

244 
00:19:22 --> 00:19:29 
species. 
There is unicellular life where the 

245 
00:19:29 --> 00:19:37 
organism is just a single cell and 
multicellular forms of life that are 

246 
00:19:37 --> 00:19:45 
made of many different types of 
cells. What's a cell? 

247 
00:19:45 --> 00:19:53 
One of the secrets to life. 
It's a little tiny bit of the 

248 
00:19:53 --> 00:20:02 
universe that's surrounded 
by a boundary. 

249 
00:20:02 --> 00:20:07 
And it's given the special name of a 
membrane. It's selective, 

250 
00:20:07 --> 00:20:12 
not very permeable to most things. 
And cells are able to put little 

251 
00:20:12 --> 00:20:17 
importers and exporters and things 
that control the passage of things 

252 
00:20:17 --> 00:20:22 
across the membrane by isolating the 
inside of a cell from all the rest 

253 
00:20:22 --> 00:20:27 
of the universe. 
That is one of the principles that 

254 
00:20:27 --> 00:20:32 
makes life possible. 
We have a couple of examples of 

255 
00:20:32 --> 00:20:38 
organisms here. 
Here are some clams that grow down 

256 
00:20:38 --> 00:20:43 
at those black smokers, 
and they can get pretty large. 

257 
00:20:43 --> 00:20:49 
And, as I say, Penny will talk a 
bit more about this. 

258 
00:20:49 --> 00:20:54 
And we have this really amazing 
diversity of life forms that we find 

259 
00:20:54 --> 00:21:00 
on this planet. 
However, if we think about this 

260 
00:21:00 --> 00:21:06 
division into unicellular and 
multicellular organisms. 

261 
00:21:06 --> 00:21:10 
Unicellular organisms include things 
that you're familiar with. 

262 
00:21:10 --> 00:21:15 
They're bacteria. There is a 
picture of just E. 

263 
00:21:15 --> 00:21:20 
coli cells. And we'll be talking 
about E. coli quite a bit as a model 

264 
00:21:20 --> 00:21:25 
organism as we go through the course. 
By studying E. 

265 
00:21:25 --> 00:21:30 
coli, scientists have learned many 
important things that apply 

266 
00:21:30 --> 00:21:35 
to all of life. 
Another kind of important 

267 
00:21:35 --> 00:21:41 
single-celled organism, 
unicellular organism is yeast. 

268 
00:21:41 --> 00:21:46 
Those are pictures of yeast 
saccharomyces that are used in 

269 
00:21:46 --> 00:21:52 
baking bread or in brewing beer or 
making wine. And another one you're 

270 
00:21:52 --> 00:21:58 
all familiar with are algae which 
are single-celled organisms that are 

271 
00:21:58 --> 00:22:04 
able to carry out photosynthesis. 
And we'll be talking about that. 

272 
00:22:04 --> 00:22:11 
If we think of an example of a 
multicellular organism then we see 

273 
00:22:11 --> 00:22:18 
there are different levels at which 
we can think about this. 

274 
00:22:18 --> 00:22:25 
We could take, for example, 
a picture of me, just an 

275 
00:22:25 --> 00:22:32 
anatomically correct diagram here, 
that I'm made up, as you are, of 

276 
00:22:32 --> 00:22:39 
about ten to the fourteenth 
human cells. 

277 
00:22:39 --> 00:22:43 
We all started out as a fertilized 
egg, which is a single cell. 

278 
00:22:43 --> 00:22:48 
And by the time we're grown up, 
where we have about ten to the 

279 
00:22:48 --> 00:22:53 
fourteenth human cells. 
Just a tremendous amount of cell 

280 
00:22:53 --> 00:22:58 
growth that had to happen 
and specialization. 

281 
00:22:58 --> 00:23:02 
The other thing you may not 
appreciate is that we have an 

282 
00:23:02 --> 00:23:07 
ecosystem inside us in our 
gastrointestinal tract. 

283 
00:23:07 --> 00:23:11 
This part, the intestine having the 
highest concentration of 

284 
00:23:11 --> 00:23:16 
microorganisms. 
But there are about ten to the 

285 
00:23:16 --> 00:23:20 
fourteenth bacteria also inside of 
our gut. So we're actually almost 

286 
00:23:20 --> 00:23:25 
the same number of human cells and 
bacterial cells. 

287 
00:23:25 --> 00:23:29 
And if we don't have those bacteria 
then our digestive systems 

288 
00:23:29 --> 00:23:35 
don't work well. 
So if we go down from a whole 

289 
00:23:35 --> 00:23:41 
organism, a whole multicellular 
organism, a level, 

290 
00:23:41 --> 00:23:47 
then we come to an organ. 
An example of that might be an eye. 

291 
00:23:47 --> 00:23:53 
And I think we have a diagram of an 
eye which is made up of different 

292 
00:23:53 --> 00:24:00 
parts. If we go down another level 
we come to a tissue. 

293 
00:24:00 --> 00:24:07 
Which is now you can begin to see 
that tissue are made up of groups of 

294 
00:24:07 --> 00:24:14 
specialized cells. 
An example might be the retina of 

295 
00:24:14 --> 00:24:21 
an eye. And if we continue to go 
downwards we'll get to single cells. 

296 
00:24:21 --> 00:24:28 
And at this point we're at the same 
level of the tail as when we're 

297 
00:24:28 --> 00:24:35 
talking about a unicellular 
organism. 

298 
00:24:35 --> 00:24:46 
If we continue down then -- 

299 
00:24:46 --> 00:24:54 
-- we can get to organelles. 
These are involved in energy 

300 
00:24:54 --> 00:25:04 
production, energy management. 

301 
00:25:04 --> 00:25:10 
And mitochondrion and chloroplasts 
are the two principle examples of 

302 
00:25:10 --> 00:25:16 
organelles that we'll talk about. 
And if we go down yet another level 

303 
00:25:16 --> 00:25:22 
of organization we get to molecules. 
And part of the reason that biology 

304 
00:25:22 --> 00:25:28 
has flourished so well over the last 
few decades at MIT is there has been 

305 
00:25:28 --> 00:25:34 
a real emphasis on looking at things 
at a cellular and molecular level. 

306 
00:25:34 --> 00:25:38 
So you're going to be hearing a lot 
about cells and a lot about 

307 
00:25:38 --> 00:25:42 
molecules as we go through this 
course. Here's an example of 

308 
00:25:42 --> 00:25:46 
rhodopsin. That's a protein. 
We'll be talking about what 

309 
00:25:46 --> 00:25:50 
proteins are, but it's a very 
important class of molecule in 

310 
00:25:50 --> 00:25:54 
nature. In this case, 
proteins involved in sensing light 

311 
00:25:54 --> 00:25:59 
and play an important 
part in your vision. 

312 
00:25:59 --> 00:26:02 
Here is another protein. 
You cannot really tell what it's 

313 
00:26:02 --> 00:26:06 
doing by just looking at it, 
but in this case this is one of the 

314 
00:26:06 --> 00:26:10 
lethal factors that is made by 
anthrax. It's one of the proteins 

315 
00:26:10 --> 00:26:14 
that anthrax makes that's capable of 
killing you if you get infected with 

316 
00:26:14 --> 00:26:18 
it. Here's another molecule we'll 
talk about in great detail. 

317 
00:26:18 --> 00:26:22 
This is DNA. You probably all know 
it's a double helix, 

318 
00:26:22 --> 00:26:26 
two strands of DNA that are held 
together by forces we'll 

319 
00:26:26 --> 00:26:30 
be discussing. 
It's an absolutely beautiful 

320 
00:26:30 --> 00:26:36 
molecule. It's fascinated me 
through all of my life. 

321 
00:26:36 --> 00:26:41 
And we'll be talking quite a bit 
about that as the course goes on. 

322 
00:26:41 --> 00:26:47 
OK. So if we're thinking about 
cells there are two important kinds 

323 
00:26:47 --> 00:26:53 
of cells that one finds 
on this planet. 

324 
00:26:53 --> 00:27:01 
Prokaryotic cells. 

325 
00:27:01 --> 00:27:07 
Prokaryotic organisms and 
eukaryotic organisms. 

326 
00:27:07 --> 00:27:14 
They each are made of cells that 
are distinguishable from each other. 

327 
00:27:14 --> 00:27:20 
I've indicated that a cell is a 
little bit of the universe that's 

328 
00:27:20 --> 00:27:27 
surrounded by a boundary or a 
membrane. But inside there, 

329 
00:27:27 --> 00:27:34 
inside of this is the DNA which 
functions as the genetic material. 

330 
00:27:34 --> 00:27:40 
It's the blueprint for everything 
that that cell is going to make and 

331 
00:27:40 --> 00:27:47 
be able to do. 
Ultimately everything is encoded 

332 
00:27:47 --> 00:27:53 
there. And in a prokaryotic cell 
the DNA is free within this membrane. 

333 
00:27:53 --> 00:28:00 
The eukaryotic cell also 
has a membrane. 

334 
00:28:00 --> 00:28:08 
But the DNA inside is inside another 
membrane compartment known as the 

335 
00:28:08 --> 00:28:16 
nucleus. And this is the DNA. 
These prokaryotic cells tend to be 

336 
00:28:16 --> 00:28:24 
of the order of a kilometer in 
length. And eukaryotic cells are 

337 
00:28:24 --> 00:28:32 
usually larger, 
can be ten to a hundred kilometers. 

338 
00:28:32 --> 00:28:36 
There's quite a bit of variation, 
but that gives you at least some 

339 
00:28:36 --> 00:28:40 
sense of the range. 
Now, I've for years, 

340 
00:28:40 --> 00:28:45 
when I did a diagram like this, 
I wanted to somehow be able to show 

341 
00:28:45 --> 00:28:49 
you that these cells were impressive 
than just what's on the board. 

342 
00:28:49 --> 00:28:54 
So here are a couple of pictures to 
try and do that. 

343 
00:28:54 --> 00:28:58 
This shows a picture of E. 
coli swimming along. And the way 

344 
00:28:58 --> 00:29:03 
this image is being taken lets you 
see what are called flagella but 

345 
00:29:03 --> 00:29:07 
which are basically the propellers 
that E. coli have that let it swim 

346 
00:29:07 --> 00:29:12 
through the water. 
These are long structures made of 

347 
00:29:12 --> 00:29:17 
proteins that are several times the 
body length of the bacterium. 

348 
00:29:17 --> 00:29:22 
And there's a molecular motor 
imbedded in the bacterium that 

349 
00:29:22 --> 00:29:27 
whirls it around at about somewhere 
between 10,000 and 100, 

350 
00:29:27 --> 00:29:32 
00 RPM. And that's what drives the 
bacteria forward. 

351 
00:29:32 --> 00:29:36 
So that was a prokaryotic cell. 
Here's a paramecium. This is a 

352 
00:29:36 --> 00:29:41 
single-celled eukaryotic organism. 
And, as you can see here, it's 

353 
00:29:41 --> 00:29:46 
capable of movement as well. 
In this case it has cilia along the 

354 
00:29:46 --> 00:29:51 
outside that allow it to move. 
Here's an interesting one. I don't 

355 
00:29:51 --> 00:29:56 
know if any of you can guess what 
these were. These were cells from 

356 
00:29:56 --> 00:30:01 
the skin of a mouse. 
They're on an Auger surface. 

357 
00:30:01 --> 00:30:05 
And, as you can see, 
they too can move. There are a 

358 
00:30:05 --> 00:30:10 
couple of things that are important 
about this. I got this slide from 

359 
00:30:10 --> 00:30:14 
Linda Griffith who is in the 
Biological Engineering Department. 

360 
00:30:14 --> 00:30:19 
At the time I got it from her I 
think it was in Chemical Engineering 

361 
00:30:19 --> 00:30:23 
several years ago. 
And what was important about this, 

362 
00:30:23 --> 00:30:28 
apart from it being a very nice 
little movie showing you a mammalian 

363 
00:30:28 --> 00:30:32 
cell moving around, 
was that I saw Linda show this 

364 
00:30:32 --> 00:30:37 
during one of her research 
seminars. 

365 
00:30:37 --> 00:30:41 
So here is an engineer at MIT who 
was showing this picture as part of 

366 
00:30:41 --> 00:30:45 
her research talk. 
And I think those of you who are 

367 
00:30:45 --> 00:30:49 
going onto engineering, 
you may be surprised at the extent 

368 
00:30:49 --> 00:30:53 
to which you need to know about 
biology as you go through your 

369 
00:30:53 --> 00:31:01 
professional careers. 

370 
00:31:01 --> 00:31:08 
OK. So one of the great discoveries 
that has happened over the last few 

371 
00:31:08 --> 00:31:15 
years that came out of our ability 
to look at DNA and RNA was the 

372 
00:31:15 --> 00:31:22 
discovery that the forms of life 
that are prokaryotic actually split 

373 
00:31:22 --> 00:31:30 
into two distinct Kingdoms that are 
very, very different. 

374 
00:31:30 --> 00:31:34 
The archaea and the bacteria. 
And just to give you a sense of the 

375 
00:31:34 --> 00:31:39 
diversity of life, 
I'll just mention a couple of these. 

376 
00:31:39 --> 00:31:44 
These archaea look like bacteria 
but they are diverged from the 

377 
00:31:44 --> 00:31:49 
bacteria as they are from the 
eukaryotes. So there were sort of 

378 
00:31:49 --> 00:31:54 
three really major Kingdoms of Life. 
And the archaea, many of them can 

379 
00:31:54 --> 00:32:00 
live in specialized environments. 
For example, sulfolobus can live at 

380 
00:32:00 --> 00:32:07 
about 90 degrees centigrade and a pH 
of somewhere between 1 and 2. 

381 
00:32:07 --> 00:32:14 
So if you see something like a hot 
springs, there are organisms such as 

382 
00:32:14 --> 00:32:21 
this that are able to grow in that 
environment. Or there are halophyes, 

383 
00:32:21 --> 00:32:28 
salt-loving archaea that can grow, 
for example, in formula sodium 

384 
00:32:28 --> 00:32:34 
chloride. 
And if you've, 

385 
00:32:34 --> 00:32:38 
for example, ever flown into San 
Francisco airport coming up from the 

386 
00:32:38 --> 00:32:42 
south over San Jose, 
you've seen things that look sort of 

387 
00:32:42 --> 00:32:46 
like these pictures where seawater 
is being evaporated down to collect 

388 
00:32:46 --> 00:32:51 
the salt. And you'll see they're 
colored, and the reason they're 

389 
00:32:51 --> 00:32:55 
colored is that these halobacteria 
are photobacteria that are able to 

390 
00:32:55 --> 00:32:59 
use light as an energy source. 
And they make pigments that absorb 

391 
00:32:59 --> 00:33:04 
the light, and that's why these salt 
areas get colored. 

392 
00:33:04 --> 00:33:11 
A third example would be methanogens. 
These are organisms that produce 

393 
00:33:11 --> 00:33:18 
methane. If you've walked into a 
lake and stepped on the bottom and 

394 
00:33:18 --> 00:33:25 
seen little bubbles come up, 
those are little bubbles of methane. 

395 
00:33:25 --> 00:33:32 
Or another place where you find 
methanogens are inside of cows. 

396 
00:33:32 --> 00:33:37 
Now, some of you may not know that 
the cow is more or less a walking 

397 
00:33:37 --> 00:33:42 
anaerobic fermentor here. 
If we have an anatomically correct 

398 
00:33:42 --> 00:33:47 
picture of a cow. 
The inside of the cow, 

399 
00:33:47 --> 00:33:52 
there's a large chamber known as the 
rumen where there's no oxygen, 

400 
00:33:52 --> 00:33:57 
and there's a culture of 
microorganisms there that 

401 
00:33:57 --> 00:34:02 
include methanogens. 
And it's this combination of 

402 
00:34:02 --> 00:34:07 
microorganisms that enables cows to 
each grass that we cannot manage to 

403 
00:34:07 --> 00:34:12 
get energy from. 
And as a byproduct of this 

404 
00:34:12 --> 00:34:17 
specialized type of metabolism 
produces methane. 

405 
00:34:17 --> 00:34:23 
And a cow burps something of the 
order of 400 liters a day of methane. 

406 
00:34:23 --> 00:34:28 
OK. So one last thing then just to 
kind of pull this all together is 

407 
00:34:28 --> 00:34:33 
that these organelles that I 
mentioned, which are also membrane 

408 
00:34:33 --> 00:34:38 
compartments that are found in 
eukaryotic cells, are 

409 
00:34:38 --> 00:35:50 
the mitochondria -- 

410 
00:35:50 --> 00:35:31 
-- or chloroplast. 
There's pretty strong evidence at 

411 
00:35:31 --> 00:35:13 
this point that these arose from 
bacteria that were things that 

412 
00:35:13 --> 00:35:07 
you're more familiar with. 
Things like E. 

413 
00:35:07 --> 00:35:15 
coli or streptococcus that causes 
strep throat or the lactic acid 

414 
00:35:15 --> 00:35:23 
bacteria that causes the milk to 
turn into yogurt which some of you 

415 
00:35:23 --> 00:35:29 
probably had for lunch today. 
That these organelles, 

416 
00:35:29 --> 00:35:33 
the mitochondria and the chloroplast 
were derived from particular type of 

417 
00:35:33 --> 00:35:37 
bacteria that probably first got 
transiently associated with 

418 
00:35:37 --> 00:35:41 
developing eukaryotic cells sometime 
back in evolution, 

419 
00:35:41 --> 00:35:45 
and eventually became captured and 
became a permanent part of the 

420 
00:35:45 --> 00:35:49 
eukaryotic cell. 
The mitochondrion is thought to 

421 
00:35:49 --> 00:35:53 
have derived from something that 
looks like today's present day 

422 
00:35:53 --> 00:35:57 
rizobia, which we'll talk about, 
that form an intracellular infection 

423 
00:35:57 --> 00:36:02 
of plants, or rickettsia which is 
chronic intracellular pathogen. 

424 
00:36:02 --> 00:36:05 
The mitochondrion look as though 
they came from something related to 

425 
00:36:05 --> 00:36:09 
that. The chloroplasts look as 
though they came from a bacterium 

426 
00:36:09 --> 00:36:13 
that was able to carry on 
photosynthesis which we'll also be 

427 
00:36:13 --> 00:36:17 
talking about. 
I want to close by giving you just 

428 
00:36:17 --> 00:36:21 
a quick little snapshot of evolution 
because I'm hoping this will maybe 

429 
00:36:21 --> 00:36:25 
make some of the things that we talk 
about in this course clearer. 

430 
00:36:25 --> 00:36:34 
So what we're going to do is we're 
going to look back from 4. 

431 
00:36:34 --> 00:36:44 
billion years ago when the earth 
was just forming -- 

432 
00:36:44 --> 00:36:57 
-- to now. I'm just going to try 

433 
00:36:57 --> 00:37:03 
and give you a few key sort of 
landmarks as we go along. 

434 
00:37:03 --> 00:37:09 
So about 4.5 billion years ago there 
was methane, carbon dioxide, 

435 
00:37:09 --> 00:37:16 
ammonium, hydrogen gas, nitrogen gas, 
water, but importantly no oxygen at 

436 
00:37:16 --> 00:37:22 
that point. There was a lot of 
debate as to how life initially came. 

437 
00:37:22 --> 00:37:29 
One of the prevalent theories at 
this point is there's something 

438 
00:37:29 --> 00:37:35 
called an RNA world. 
This is just a hypothesis in which 

439 
00:37:35 --> 00:37:40 
it's thought that perhaps the 
molecule RNA, which we'll talk about, 

440 
00:37:40 --> 00:37:45 
played role as both something that 
was able to catalyze chemical 

441 
00:37:45 --> 00:37:51 
reactions and therefore did things 
actively and also stored information. 

442 
00:37:51 --> 00:37:56 
But, in any case, 
the best guess is that the first 

443 
00:37:56 --> 00:38:01 
life that was about 3. 
billion years ago, somewhere in 

444 
00:38:01 --> 00:38:06 
that vicinity. 
It was something that probably 

445 
00:38:06 --> 00:38:10 
resembled most closely a present-day 
bacterium, a single-celled organism, 

446 
00:38:10 --> 00:38:14 
something like that. Now, initially 
when life got started it's thought 

447 
00:38:14 --> 00:38:18 
that there were a lot of organic 
chemicals that had been made as a 

448 
00:38:18 --> 00:38:22 
consequence of lightening strikes 
and all sorts of chemistry that had 

449 
00:38:22 --> 00:38:26 
happened so there was sort of a soup 
of some kind, some molecules 

450 
00:38:26 --> 00:38:31 
that could be used. 
So probably these first organisms 

451 
00:38:31 --> 00:38:35 
where able to basically use some 
preformed nutrients. 

452 
00:38:35 --> 00:38:40 
And then as the soup began to get 
depleted by using it they had to 

453 
00:38:40 --> 00:38:44 
learn to synthesize, 
at least develop systems that would 

454 
00:38:44 --> 00:38:49 
synthesize these building blocks. 
And they also had to begin to worry 

455 
00:38:49 --> 00:38:54 
about what to use as energy. 
And so somewhere in here, something 

456 
00:38:54 --> 00:38:58 
that I'll call, 
in a silly way, photosynthesis 

457 
00:38:58 --> 00:39:03 
released number one. 
But this was a system that enabled 

458 
00:39:03 --> 00:39:08 
the organism to capture energy from 
sunlight so that it wasn't now 

459 
00:39:08 --> 00:39:14 
dependent on getting energy by 
eating some preformed ingredient. 

460 
00:39:14 --> 00:39:19 
It was then able to take carbon 
dioxide and make it into forms that 

461 
00:39:19 --> 00:39:24 
were useful, of carbon that were 
useful for life, 

462 
00:39:24 --> 00:39:30 
and it produced molecules such as 
sulfur as a waste product. 

463 
00:39:30 --> 00:39:36 
There was a bit later in evolution, 
somewhere in here, something we 

464 
00:39:36 --> 00:39:43 
might think of as photosynthesis 
release two. This was an improved 

465 
00:39:43 --> 00:39:49 
version of photosynthesis. 
It captured more energy, worked 

466 
00:39:49 --> 00:39:56 
better, but it developed, 
it had a waste product which was 

467 
00:39:56 --> 00:40:02 
oxygen. 
Well, oxygen hadn't been in our 

468 
00:40:02 --> 00:40:06 
atmosphere. And the first thing 
that sort of happened was that the 

469 
00:40:06 --> 00:40:10 
world started to rust. 
All the iron, a lot of the iron 

470 
00:40:10 --> 00:40:14 
started to interact with the oxygen. 
And Penny will tell you that at the 

471 
00:40:14 --> 00:40:19 
base of the sea there are huge beds 
of iron oxide that came from this 

472 
00:40:19 --> 00:40:23 
slow rusting of the earth. 
And so it took many, many years 

473 
00:40:23 --> 00:40:27 
before oxygen levels started to rise. 
As you know it's about 20% of our 

474 
00:40:27 --> 00:40:32 
atmosphere now. 
Even at this stage it was only a few 

475 
00:40:32 --> 00:40:37 
percent of our, 
made up a few percent of our 

476 
00:40:37 --> 00:40:43 
atmosphere, even by here in 
evolution. The first eukaryotic 

477 
00:40:43 --> 00:40:48 
cell is thought to have appeared 
somewhere here. 

478 
00:40:48 --> 00:40:53 
Again, it was likely a 
single-celled organism like some of 

479 
00:40:53 --> 00:40:59 
those pictures I showed you. 
And evolution continued to go. 

480 
00:40:59 --> 00:41:04 
Somewhere around a billion years 
ago sex was evolved which enabled 

481 
00:41:04 --> 00:41:09 
eukaryotic organisms to exchange 
genetic material, 

482 
00:41:09 --> 00:41:15 
and therefore evolve at a fast rate 
than they could previously. 

483 
00:41:15 --> 00:41:19 
The Cambrian Period was about a 0. 
billion to 0.6 billion years ago. 

484 
00:41:19 --> 00:41:24 
And there was a veritable explosion 
of life forms. 

485 
00:41:24 --> 00:41:28 
And you can still see in the fossil 
records how much diversity was 

486 
00:41:28 --> 00:41:33 
generated at that point, 
some of which went on to become life 

487 
00:41:33 --> 00:41:38 
forms and other which probably were 
more evolutionary dead ends. 

488 
00:41:38 --> 00:41:46 
Finally we get to the dinosaurs that 
were about 245 to 65 million years 

489 
00:41:46 --> 00:41:55 
ago which would place them somewhere 
here on this timeline. 

490 
00:41:55 --> 00:42:04 
So in honor of this course, 
I've commissioned a full scale model 

491 
00:42:04 --> 00:42:13 
of anatomically correct 
[NOISE OBSCURES]. 

492 
00:42:13 --> 00:42:18 
So we'll put our dinosaur here, 
if I can get him to stay put for a 

493 
00:42:18 --> 00:42:23 
minute. All right. 
And at this point in evolution 

494 
00:42:23 --> 00:42:28 
things started to get interesting. 
So somewhere about here, 4 million 

495 
00:42:28 --> 00:42:34 
years ago we've got the first 
evidence of hominoids. 

496 
00:42:34 --> 00:42:39 
Maybe 20,000 years ago we found the 
cave paintings in France. 

497 
00:42:39 --> 00:42:45 
And then there was the Roman Empire 
and Columbus discovered America. 

498 
00:42:45 --> 00:42:51 
And you were born and the Red Sox 
won the World Series and the 

499 
00:42:51 --> 00:42:57 
Patriots have just won the Super 
Bowl. And we are now here at the 

500 
00:42:57 --> 00:43:03 
peak of evolution which is, 
as you all know, the MIT student. 

501 
00:43:03 --> 00:43:06 
So we'll put our MIT student here, 
who I can probably not get to stay 

502 
00:43:06 --> 00:43:10 
put because you can never get MIT 
students to stay anywhere. 

503 
00:43:10 --> 00:43:14 
But, in any case, this is sort of a 
silly demonstration. 

504 
00:43:14 --> 00:43:18 
But there is a very profound reason 
why I'm doing it. 

505 
00:43:18 --> 00:43:22 
And I must say I don't think I'd 
ever fully appreciated it until I 

506 
00:43:22 --> 00:43:26 
actually thought of doing this demo 
for the class. 

507 
00:43:26 --> 00:43:30 
But what I think you can see is 
that evolution, 

508 
00:43:30 --> 00:43:34 
for the most part, 
happened at the single cell level. 

509 
00:43:34 --> 00:43:38 
Many people tended to think 
evolution, that was about dinosaurs 

510 
00:43:38 --> 00:43:42 
and all that stuff. 
We can say that dinosaurs are, 

511 
00:43:42 --> 00:43:47 
practically now, most of evolution 
occurred at the level of single 

512 
00:43:47 --> 00:43:51 
cells, and that all this amazing 
diversity we see around us was very 

513 
00:43:51 --> 00:43:56 
recent embellishments in evolution. 
So that means when you study 

514 
00:43:56 --> 00:44:00 
biology at the cellular and 
molecular level you find tremendous 

515 
00:44:00 --> 00:44:04 
commonalities. 
If you look inside a sulfolobus 

516 
00:44:04 --> 00:44:08 
growing in hot spring, 
if you look inside an E. 

517 
00:44:08 --> 00:44:12 
coli, if you look inside a yeast and 
you look inside one of our cells you 

518 
00:44:12 --> 00:44:16 
find that, to a huge extent, 
many, many of the cellular 

519 
00:44:16 --> 00:44:20 
components are common. 
They arose similarly in evolution 

520 
00:44:20 --> 00:44:24 
that they're shared by all forms of 
life. Of course, 

521 
00:44:24 --> 00:44:28 
there are some things that developed 
later and are different. 

522 
00:44:28 --> 00:44:32 
But that's one of the reasons that 
you can learn so much by studying 

523 
00:44:32 --> 00:44:36 
biology at the cellular molecular 
level and why we'll emphasize it a 

524 
00:44:36 --> 00:44:41 
fair bit in this course. 
The other thing that I'd like to 

525 
00:44:41 --> 00:44:45 
make out of this, 
a theme that you'll hear along is 

526 
00:44:45 --> 00:44:50 
that organisms modify their 
environment. You can see that in 

527 
00:44:50 --> 00:44:54 
the case of oxygen back when the 
earth formed. There was no oxygen 

528 
00:44:54 --> 00:44:59 
in our atmosphere. Now 
we have a lot of it. 

529 
00:44:59 --> 00:45:03 
The reason it's there is because it 
was generated by organisms carrying 

530 
00:45:03 --> 00:45:08 
out photosynthesis and generating 
oxygen as a waste product. 

531 
00:45:08 --> 00:45:13 
And that was an absolutely critical 
thing to enable creatures such as 

532 
00:45:13 --> 00:45:18 
ourselves, which are dependent on 
oxygen for us just to be alive, 

533 
00:45:18 --> 00:45:23 
if we hadn't had this change in 
environment things like us could 

534 
00:45:23 --> 00:45:28 
have, organisms like us 
couldn't have evolved. 

535 
00:45:28 --> 00:45:32 
So, anyway, I hope that will give 
you a little sort of snapshot of 

536 
00:45:32 --> 00:45:37 
evolution and will help guide your 
understanding of this course. 

537 
00:45:37 --> 00:45:40 
We'll see you at the next lecture.
