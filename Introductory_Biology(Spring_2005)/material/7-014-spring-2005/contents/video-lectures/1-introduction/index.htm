<p></p>
<p>I am a professor in the Biology Department at MIT. And I will be  co-teaching this course with Penny Chisholm who is a professor in the  Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, as well as a  professor in the Biology Department. As well, Penny was recently  featured in the journal Nature. She is a very well-known oceanographer  who has become deservedly famous for discovering a very small bacterium  that's capable of carrying out photosynthesis. For many years  oceanographers used filters whose holes were big enough that this  bacterium went through.</p> <p>And so when they were doing their studies  of the ocean and how the biomass that was there and all the fluxes and  so on, they didn't know this organism existed which can form up to 50%  of the biomass in parts of the ocean. So Penny is really a wonderful  lecturer, a wonderful person, and she'll be teaching the component of  7.014 which deals with ecology and the environment. And this is a  section of 7.014 that makes it different from the other two versions,  7.012 and 7.013. So for me personally this is an absolutely wonderful  and exciting opportunity to be able to teach this Introductory Biology  course. For some of you I know that biology is going to either be a  major part of your career or quite possibly, even if you're in  engineering or something else, you will find yourselves working with a  biological system.</p> <p>You can see that happening all over campus  these days that more and more engineering departments are finding that  they're working on problems that come from biology or have a biological  component. I'm sure there are at least a few of you here who are only  here because it's a required course and you might well wish you were  somewhere else. However, I will do my best to try to communicate to you  why you need to know some biology, too.</p> <p>I think most of you know  you can hardly pick up a newspaper these days without running into  something that demands a knowledge of biology, something about stem  cells, something about cloning humans, something about a new drug, lots  of things having to do with biological affects on the environment and so  on. You're also going to be confronted with decisions about your  health, about the health of your loved ones concerning cancer,  concerning whether a child might have birth defects, all sort of issues  that will affect your personal lives that demand an understanding of  biology.</p> <p>So I feel with some passion that whether you think you're  going to need biology in your professional career or not, everyone in  this institution needs some understanding of biology to just live their  ordinary lives. I also think as MIT students you're going to be looked  at, as you go through your lives, as people who are knowledgeable about  science and engineering. And you'll be asked questions that go far  beyond your immediate area of expertise. And again I think that's  another reason for needing to know some of biology.</p> <p>Anyway, it's  an absolutely wonderful time to teach biology because things have just  been exploding over the last two or three decades and things are moving  faster than ever. And another wonderful thing about teaching biology is  that MIT is an absolutely marvelous place to teach it. Just to sort of  drive this home, in the Biology Department alone there are four Nobel  laureates who got honored for critical discoveries in biology. Gobin  Khorana who is just down the hall from me synthesized the first gene. It  was an extraordinary feat of synthesis of organic chemistry  synthesizing DNA. When I was an undergrad I was a chemistry major but I  had to take an introductory biology course. And at that point the DNA  wasn't mentioned in the high school course.</p> <p>So the first time that  I heard about DNA was in my introductory biology course. And that  determined by career direction. I thought that was such an interesting  molecule that I wanted to work on it and I talked myself into one of the  labs in Ottawa, Canada where I grew up that was trying to synthesize  DNA, synthesize pieces of the gene. And, as it turned out later,  competing unsuccessfully with my now colleague Gobin Khorana. Susumu  Tonegawa got a Nobel prize for discovering the amazing molecular  operations that underlie the diversity of the immune system.</p> <p>Your  immune system has the capacity to recognize viruses and bacteria, all  sorts of different pathogens, including molecules. It can recognize  molecules that haven't even ever been synthesized in the history of  life. And we'll talk towards the end of the course about the way that  happens. And you'll see why Susumu got his Nobel prize. Phil Sharp got  his for discovering RNA splicing completely unanticipated component of  the very heart of molecular biology. And then Bob Horvitz who was of  pure mind when he started at MIT at the same time and our labs were side  by side for many years, got his Nobel prize in 2002 for discovering a  phenomenon, the general term is "programmed" cell death. And it plays  all sorts of important roles in biology from sculpting the shapes of  organs and tissues.</p> <p>We initially have webs when we're developing  between our fingers, and those go away because of the programmed cell  death that the cells that were making the web disappear. And another  role of that is prevent cancer. That if cells sense that something is  very messed up they have a sort of suicide program that would make them  destroy themselves. And if that doesn't happen those cells could go on  and become more and more abnormal and eventually turn into an invasive  cancer.</p> <p>Anyway, there's a picture of Bob when the institute was  celebrating his Nobel prize. He was getting a congratulatory kiss from  Martha Constantine-Paton, also a professor in the Biology Department who  happens to be Bob's wife. Most of you know that the human genome has  now been sequenced. That was one of the huge undertakings and most  important undertakings in modern biology over the last while. It was an  incredible feat. Each cell has, as most of you know, 46 chromosomes. And  that's a total of about two meters of DNA in every human cell. And that  two meters of DNA is composed of about 3 million DNA base pairs, these  letters A, T, G and C that we'll be talking about as we go through the  course.</p> <p>So to sequence the genome you had to work out the sequence  of the exact run of these A, G, T and Cs along the backbone for 3  billion base pairs. And somewhere that genome encodes somewhere between  20,000 and 30,000 genes. And we'll be talking about the proteins that  are encoded by most of those genes and their important roles as we go on  in the course. What some of you may not know is the key role that MIT  played in this. About a third of the genome was sequenced at the  Whitehead MIT Genome Center. And here are some of the robots that were  used to sequence that DNA. And that sequencing effort was led by Eric  Lander whose name some of you may recognize because he teaches the fall  version of 7.</p> <p>012 along with Bob Weinberg. So here are just a few  examples of why I think it's important for you to understand biology  regardless of whether you're going to go on and use it professionally.  Most of you know one of the biggest challenges we face on this planet is  this AIDS epidemic. It's caused by a certain kind of virus called HIV-1  that gets into particular cells of your immune system that normally  defends us against infection and destroys those.</p> <p>And then people  die from infections by other organisms that normally you can fight off.  It's a huge problem with vast societal and economic implications. And  it's one that we're still, as a mankind still trying to deal with and  grapple with. Here's another example. Just a couple of years ago there  was the scar of anthrax. It's a bacterium that's very pathogenic and  kills its host fairly easily. It does it by making particular toxins.  The details shown here don't matter, but just reminding you that this is  something that was in the front pages of the paper just a little while  ago. A couple of years ago, when I was teaching this, we had the scare  of the SARS virus that went all the way during the course when I was  teaching it from the initial discovery of the virus to the actual  sequencing of the genome which had happened by later on in this course.</p> <p>Smallpox  was a disease we thought that we eliminated, but now it's come back as a  bioterrorism treat and there is increased study of smallpox. It's  something we have to worry about again.</p> <p>Here's another example.  This is a picture showing the start of a transgenic animal. We'll talk  about how this process goes later in the course. And it's related also  to this whole issue of cloning, using the sense of the word such as in  trying to clone a human or clone an animal to make a genetically  identical copy. So you'll see there are a couple of different uses of  the word cloning as we go through the course. There's a lot of fuss in  the news and the newspapers about genetically modified food, and people  have different positions on it.</p> <p>Here's a case where I think the  benefit of a genetically modified food could hardly be argued with.  About two-thirds of the world's population uses rice as their primary  source of food. One of the problems with rice is that it doesn't make  beta-carotene. And beta carotene is what our bodies take and use to make  vitamin A. And if you have a vitamin A deficiency people are prone to  infection. They have immune deficiencies in their immune system and  blindness. And this deficiency of vitamin A caused by eating rice  afflicts about 400 million people worldwide. Well, rice is only two  chemical steps away from being able to make beta carotene. This is a  genetically modified version of rice that has those two extra steps  inserted in it.</p> <p>And you can see it's golden because it's making  beta carotene. If people were to eat that form of rice then they  wouldn't have this problem with vitamin A deficiency. Penny Chisholm in  her part of the course will be considering things that are more global  level. Here's a picture of our planet, and there are issues that you  know about there. This is the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere  rising. And that's a real phenomenon.</p> <p>This shows from 1960 to  1995. This is associated with a global warming that again is undeniable  that it's happening. You'll see stuff in the papers. And these gases,  particularly carbon dioxide and methane, they're known as greenhouse  gases are playing a role in that. And probably mankind is playing a role  in the production of those gases and, hence, in global warming. And  Penny will talk to you a little more about that. Right here at MIT Mario  Molina in EAPS discovered the ozone hole and got a Nobel prize for  that. Ozone is important because it absorbs UV, a critical component of  ultraviolet radiation that would damage our cells if we were exposed to  it. And because of the emission of fluorocarbons in the environment this  large hole developed over Antarctic.</p> <p>If that had spread, it would  have been a real disaster. And that seems to be, the efforts to cut  down the release of fluorocarbons seem to be helping with that. But,  again, Penny will have more to say. Those of you who've lived around  here for a little bit probably know that the fishing industry just  locally has had a very hard time. There is a fishing boat just up in  Gloucester, just up the coast less than an hour from here. And part of  the problems, again, are caused by mismanagement of the resources where  the fish have been, stocks have been over-fished so some of the  fisheries have come to the point of collapse or near.</p> <p>Places such  as the Grand Banks off of Newfoundland there has been a collapse, and  it's not at all clear that it can be reversed and whether they'll be cod  in large quantities every again there. OK. So there a variety of ways  that we can study biology.</p> <p>And I think I'm going to begin by  outlining how we do that. Biology is an experimental science and it's  one of the really important themes that we'll run through in this  course. You cannot study biology by just sitting down with a pen and  paper in a room and thinking. You have to get out and find out what's  there. You need to make observations. You need to try experiments. You  need to formulate hypotheses and test them and either modify your  hypothesis or reject it and so on. But it's a continual cycle of  experimentation and making hypotheses and testing. It's the Scientific  Method at work. But you can carry that out at different levels. The very  highest level would be the biosphere.</p> <p>Here's one example. That's  earth. It's here. There are many, many species of life that are on  there. There are many more than a million. And the estimates of how many  there are range from, in total, 10 to the 20 million estimated. And one  of the big worries right at the moment is that as rain forests are  being depleted, parts of the world that are a rich source of biological  diversity, as those are disappearing we're losing diversity at quite a  rate. Just a couple of years ago I had a chance to fly over a part of  Brazil. And it was just scary to see from the plane how the rain forest  was just being cut down.</p> <p>And you could just see how fast some of  the rain forest was disappearing, and with it many different types of  species that only can live there. One can look instead, going down a  level, at an ecosystem which is a particular environment -- -- and the  species of life found in it. And just to give you a couple of examples  of that, it could be a salt marsh as shown here. Or here's an  interesting environment that Penny Chisholm will tell you more about.  This is a black smoker. There's a vent several miles deep in the Pacific  Ocean. The water temperature that's gushing out of here is around 360  degree centigrade. And there's a particular community of life that's  able to grow around these deep vents.</p> <p>And Penny will tell you more  about that. Then going down yet another level you can come to a  population. And this is interacting -- -- or interbreeding organisms. An  example might be the fiddler crabs in a salt marsh. Or here we see an  interesting population. These are tube worms that are up to a meter or  more in length that you find down at these black smokers. If we move  down yet another level -- -- we come to organisms.</p> <p>Organisms have  three important sorts of characteristics that we'll talk quite a bit  about in this course. They carry out metabolism which is the sum of all  the different chemical reactions necessary for life. They undergo  regulated growth -- -- and they reproduce. And the sort of fundamental  unit of life that we will talk about over and over again in this course  is known as a cell. And life comes in two kinds of species. There is  unicellular life where the organism is just a single cell and  multicellular forms of life that are made of many different types of  cells.</p> <p>What's a cell? One of the secrets to life. It's a little  tiny bit of the universe that's surrounded by a boundary. And it's given  the special name of a membrane. It's selective, not very permeable to  most things. And cells are able to put little importers and exporters  and things that control the passage of things across the membrane by  isolating the inside of a cell from all the rest of the universe. That  is one of the principles that makes life possible. We have a couple of  examples of organisms here.</p> <p>Here are some clams that grow down at  those black smokers, and they can get pretty large. And, as I say, Penny  will talk a bit more about this. And we have this really amazing  diversity of life forms that we find on this planet. However, if we  think about this division into unicellular and multicellular organisms.  Unicellular organisms include things that you're familiar with. They're  bacteria. There is a picture of just E. coli cells. And we'll be talking  about E. coli quite a bit as a model organism as we go through the  course. By studying E. coli, scientists have learned many important  things that apply to all of life. Another kind of important  single-celled organism, unicellular organism is yeast.</p> <p>Those are  pictures of yeast saccharomyces that are used in baking bread or in  brewing beer or making wine. And another one you're all familiar with  are algae which are single-celled organisms that are able to carry out  photosynthesis. And we'll be talking about that. If we think of an  example of a multicellular organism then we see there are different  levels at which we can think about this. We could take, for example, a  picture of me, just an anatomically correct diagram here, that I'm made  up, as you are, of about ten to the fourteenth human cells. We all  started out as a fertilized egg, which is a single cell.</p> <p>And by  the time we're grown up, where we have about ten to the fourteenth human  cells. Just a tremendous amount of cell growth that had to happen and  specialization. The other thing you may not appreciate is that we have  an ecosystem inside us in our gastrointestinal tract. This part, the  intestine having the highest concentration of microorganisms. But there  are about ten to the fourteenth bacteria also inside of our gut. So  we're actually almost the same number of human cells and bacterial  cells. And if we don't have those bacteria then our digestive systems  don't work well. So if we go down from a whole organism, a whole  multicellular organism, a level, then we come to an organ.</p> <p>An  example of that might be an eye. And I think we have a diagram of an eye  which is made up of different parts. If we go down another level we  come to a tissue. Which is now you can begin to see that tissue are made  up of groups of specialized cells. An example might be the retina of an  eye. And if we continue to go downwards we'll get to single cells. And  at this point we're at the same level of the tail as when we're talking  about a unicellular organism. If we continue down then -- -- we can get  to organelles.</p> <p>These are involved in energy production, energy  management. And mitochondrion and chloroplasts are the two principle  examples of organelles that we'll talk about. And if we go down yet  another level of organization we get to molecules. And part of the  reason that biology has flourished so well over the last few decades at  MIT is there has been a real emphasis on looking at things at a cellular  and molecular level. So you're going to be hearing a lot about cells  and a lot about molecules as we go through this course.</p> <p>Here's an  example of rhodopsin. That's a protein. We'll be talking about what  proteins are, but it's a very important class of molecule in nature. In  this case, proteins involved in sensing light and play an important part  in your vision. Here is another protein. You cannot really tell what  it's doing by just looking at it, but in this case this is one of the  lethal factors that is made by anthrax. It's one of the proteins that  anthrax makes that's capable of killing you if you get infected with it.  Here's another molecule we'll talk about in great detail. This is DNA.  You probably all know it's a double helix, two strands of DNA that are  held together by forces we'll be discussing. It's an absolutely  beautiful molecule.</p> <p>It's fascinated me through all of my life. And  we'll be talking quite a bit about that as the course goes on. OK. So  if we're thinking about cells there are two important kinds of cells  that one finds on this planet. Prokaryotic cells. Prokaryotic organisms  and eukaryotic organisms. They each are made of cells that are  distinguishable from each other. I've indicated that a cell is a little  bit of the universe that's surrounded by a boundary or a membrane. But  inside there, inside of this is the DNA which functions as the genetic  material. It's the blueprint for everything that that cell is going to  make and be able to do.</p> <p>Ultimately everything is encoded there.  And in a prokaryotic cell the DNA is free within this membrane. The  eukaryotic cell also has a membrane. But the DNA inside is inside  another membrane compartment known as the nucleus. And this is the DNA.  These prokaryotic cells tend to be of the order of a kilometer in  length. And eukaryotic cells are usually larger, can be ten to a hundred  kilometers. There's quite a bit of variation, but that gives you at  least some sense of the range.</p> <p>Now, I've for years, when I did a  diagram like this, I wanted to somehow be able to show you that these  cells were impressive than just what's on the board. So here are a  couple of pictures to try and do that. This shows a picture of E. coli  swimming along. And the way this image is being taken lets you see what  are called flagella but which are basically the propellers that E. coli  have that let it swim through the water. These are long structures made  of proteins that are several times the body length of the bacterium.</p> <p>And  there's a molecular motor imbedded in the bacterium that whirls it  around at about somewhere between 10,000 and 100,000 RPM. And that's  what drives the bacteria forward. So that was a prokaryotic cell. Here's  a paramecium. This is a single-celled eukaryotic organism. And, as you  can see here, it's capable of movement as well. In this case it has  cilia along the outside that allow it to move. Here's an interesting  one. I don't know if any of you can guess what these were. These were  cells from the skin of a mouse. They're on an Auger surface. And, as you  can see, they too can move.</p> <p>There are a couple of things that are  important about this. I got this slide from Linda Griffith who is in  the Biological Engineering Department. At the time I got it from her I  think it was in Chemical Engineering several years ago. And what was  important about this, apart from it being a very nice little movie  showing you a mammalian cell moving around, was that I saw Linda show  this during one of her research seminars. So here is an engineer at MIT  who was showing this picture as part of her research talk.</p> <p>And I  think those of you who are going onto engineering, you may be surprised  at the extent to which you need to know about biology as you go through  your professional careers. OK. So one of the great discoveries that has  happened over the last few years that came out of our ability to look at  DNA and RNA was the discovery that the forms of life that are  prokaryotic actually split into two distinct Kingdoms that are very,  very different. The archaea and the bacteria.</p> <p>And just to give you  a sense of the diversity of life, I'll just mention a couple of these.  These archaea look like bacteria but they are diverged from the bacteria  as they are from the eukaryotes. So there were sort of three really  major Kingdoms of Life. And the archaea, many of them can live in  specialized environments. For example, sulfolobus can live at about 90  degrees centigrade and a pH of somewhere between 1 and 2. So if you see  something like a hot springs, there are organisms such as this that are  able to grow in that environment. Or there are halophyes, salt-loving  archaea that can grow, for example, in formula sodium chloride. And if  you've, for example, ever flown into San Francisco airport coming up  from the south over San Jose, you've seen things that look sort of like  these pictures where seawater is being evaporated down to collect the  salt.</p> <p>And you'll see they're colored, and the reason they're  colored is that these halobacteria are photobacteria that are able to  use light as an energy source. And they make pigments that absorb the  light, and that's why these salt areas get colored. A third example  would be methanogens.</p> <p>These are organisms that produce methane. If  you've walked into a lake and stepped on the bottom and seen little  bubbles come up, those are little bubbles of methane. Or another place  where you find methanogens are inside of cows. Now, some of you may not  know that the cow is more or less a walking anaerobic fermentor here. If  we have an anatomically correct picture of a cow. The inside of the  cow, there's a large chamber known as the rumen where there's no oxygen,  and there's a culture of microorganisms there that include methanogens.  And it's this combination of microorganisms that enables cows to each  grass that we cannot manage to get energy from.</p> <p>And as a byproduct  of this specialized type of metabolism produces methane. And a cow  burps something of the order of 400 liters a day of methane. OK. So one  last thing then just to kind of pull this all together is that these  organelles that I mentioned, which are also membrane compartments that  are found in eukaryotic cells, are the mitochondria -- -- or  chloroplast.</p> <p>There's pretty strong evidence at this point that  these arose from bacteria that were things that you're more familiar  with. Things like E. coli or streptococcus that causes strep throat or  the lactic acid bacteria that causes the milk to turn into yogurt which  some of you probably had for lunch today. That these organelles, the  mitochondria and the chloroplast were derived from particular type of  bacteria that probably first got transiently associated with developing  eukaryotic cells sometime back in evolution, and eventually became  captured and became a permanent part of the eukaryotic cell. The  mitochondrion is thought to have derived from something that looks like  today's present day rizobia, which we'll talk about, that form an  intracellular infection of plants, or rickettsia which is chronic  intracellular pathogen. The mitochondrion look as though they came from  something related to that.</p> <p>The chloroplasts look as though they  came from a bacterium that was able to carry on photosynthesis which  we'll also be talking about. I want to close by giving you just a quick  little snapshot of evolution because I'm hoping this will maybe make  some of the things that we talk about in this course clearer. So what  we're going to do is we're going to look back from 4.5 billion years ago  when the earth was just forming -- -- to now.</p> <p>I'm just going to  try and give you a few key sort of landmarks as we go along. So about  4.5 billion years ago there was methane, carbon dioxide, ammonium,  hydrogen gas, nitrogen gas, water, but importantly no oxygen at that  point. There was a lot of debate as to how life initially came. One of  the prevalent theories at this point is there's something called an RNA  world. This is just a hypothesis in which it's thought that perhaps the  molecule RNA, which we'll talk about, played role as both something that  was able to catalyze chemical reactions and therefore did things  actively and also stored information. But, in any case, the best guess  is that the first life that was about 3.8 billion years ago, somewhere  in that vicinity. It was something that probably resembled most closely a  present-day bacterium, a single-celled organism, something like that.</p> <p>Now,  initially when life got started it's thought that there were a lot of  organic chemicals that had been made as a consequence of lightening  strikes and all sorts of chemistry that had happened so there was sort  of a soup of some kind, some molecules that could be used. So probably  these first organisms where able to basically use some preformed  nutrients.</p> <p>And then as the soup began to get depleted by using it  they had to learn to synthesize, at least develop systems that would  synthesize these building blocks. And they also had to begin to worry  about what to use as energy. And so somewhere in here, something that  I'll call, in a silly way, photosynthesis released number one. But this  was a system that enabled the organism to capture energy from sunlight  so that it wasn't now dependent on getting energy by eating some  preformed ingredient.</p> <p>It was then able to take carbon dioxide and  make it into forms that were useful, of carbon that were useful for  life, and it produced molecules such as sulfur as a waste product. There  was a bit later in evolution, somewhere in here, something we might  think of as photosynthesis release two. This was an improved version of  photosynthesis. It captured more energy, worked better, but it  developed, it had a waste product which was oxygen. Well, oxygen hadn't  been in our atmosphere.</p> <p>And the first thing that sort of happened  was that the world started to rust. All the iron, a lot of the iron  started to interact with the oxygen. And Penny will tell you that at the  base of the sea there are huge beds of iron oxide that came from this  slow rusting of the earth. And so it took many, many years before oxygen  levels started to rise. As you know it's about 20% of our atmosphere  now. Even at this stage it was only a few percent of our, made up a few  percent of our atmosphere, even by here in evolution.</p> <p>The first  eukaryotic cell is thought to have appeared somewhere here. Again, it  was likely a single-celled organism like some of those pictures I showed  you. And evolution continued to go. Somewhere around a billion years  ago sex was evolved which enabled eukaryotic organisms to exchange  genetic material, and therefore evolve at a fast rate than they could  previously. The Cambrian Period was about a 0.</p> <p>5 billion to 0.6  billion years ago. And there was a veritable explosion of life forms.  And you can still see in the fossil records how much diversity was  generated at that point, some of which went on to become life forms and  other which probably were more evolutionary dead ends. Finally we get to  the dinosaurs that were about 245 to 65 million years ago which would  place them somewhere here on this timeline. So in honor of this course,  I've commissioned a full scale model of anatomically correct [NOISE  OBSCURES]. So we'll put our dinosaur here, if I can get him to stay put  for a minute.</p> <p>All right. And at this point in evolution things  started to get interesting. So somewhere about here, 4 million years ago  we've got the first evidence of hominoids. Maybe 20,000 years ago we  found the cave paintings in France. And then there was the Roman Empire  and Columbus discovered America. And you were born and the Red Sox won  the World Series and the Patriots have just won the Super Bowl. And we  are now here at the peak of evolution which is, as you all know, the MIT  student. So we'll put our MIT student here, who I can probably not get  to stay put because you can never get MIT students to stay anywhere.</p> <p>But,  in any case, this is sort of a silly demonstration. But there is a very  profound reason why I'm doing it. And I must say I don't think I'd ever  fully appreciated it until I actually thought of doing this demo for  the class. But what I think you can see is that evolution, for the most  part, happened at the single cell level. Many people tended to think  evolution, that was about dinosaurs and all that stuff.</p> <p>We can say  that dinosaurs are, practically now, most of evolution occurred at the  level of single cells, and that all this amazing diversity we see around  us was very recent embellishments in evolution. So that means when you  study biology at the cellular and molecular level you find tremendous  commonalities. If you look inside a sulfolobus growing in hot spring, if  you look inside an E.</p> <p>coli, if you look inside a yeast and you  look inside one of our cells you find that, to a huge extent, many, many  of the cellular components are common. They arose similarly in  evolution that they're shared by all forms of life. Of course, there are  some things that developed later and are different. But that's one of  the reasons that you can learn so much by studying biology at the  cellular molecular level and why we'll emphasize it a fair bit in this  course. The other thing that I'd like to make out of this, a theme that  you'll hear along is that organisms modify their environment. You can  see that in the case of oxygen back when the earth formed. There was no  oxygen in our atmosphere. Now we have a lot of it. The reason it's there  is because it was generated by organisms carrying out photosynthesis  and generating oxygen as a waste product.</p> <p>And that was an  absolutely critical thing to enable creatures such as ourselves, which  are dependent on oxygen for us just to be alive, if we hadn't had this  change in environment things like us could have, organisms like us  couldn't have evolved. So, anyway, I hope that will give you a little  sort of snapshot of evolution and will help guide your understanding of  this course. We'll see you at the next lecture.</p>
