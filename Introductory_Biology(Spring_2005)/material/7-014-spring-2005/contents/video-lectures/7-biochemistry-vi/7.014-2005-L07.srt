1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
Just very quickly,
I mentioned to you the other day

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:08
that article about Romney making a
policy statement about embryonic

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:13
stem cell research and said here
were sort of examples of issues we

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:17
were thinking about in this course
that would come into your ordinary

5
00:00:17 --> 00:00:22
life.  Here's on today's Globe
there's, “Kennedy rips Romney over

6
00:00:22 --> 00:00:26
stem cell policy.
This debate is continuing.

7
00:00:26 --> 00:00:31
It's on the front page of today's
Boston Globe.

8
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
We have two people neither of whom
probably have the background in

9
00:00:34 --> 00:00:38
biology, that you guys are going to
have by the time you finish this

10
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
course, having to grapple with these
very serious scientific issues that

11
00:00:41 --> 00:00:45
have all kinds of implications.
Here's another thing.  This was in

12
00:00:45 --> 00:00:49
yesterday's newspaper.
This was on, I think, the second

13
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52
page of the Boston Globe.
It's about a curator over at

14
00:00:52 --> 00:00:56
Harvard at The Museum of Comparative
Zoology that got all these different

15
00:00:56 --> 00:01:00
birds, some of whom are
extinct and something.

16
00:01:00 --> 00:01:03
And now the curator,
instead of just having them there as

17
00:01:03 --> 00:01:07
a sort of collection and that's all
it is, is getting DNA out of these

18
00:01:07 --> 00:01:10
specimens and working back and
looking at gaining new insights from

19
00:01:10 --> 00:01:14
animals that aren't found on this
planet anymore.

20
00:01:14 --> 00:01:17
And this was one was from,
I didn't want to show you this on

21
00:01:17 --> 00:01:21
Valentine's Day particularly,
but this is critical.  I don't

22
00:01:21 --> 00:01:25
subscribe to The New York Times but
for some reason one appeared on my

23
00:01:25 --> 00:01:29
porch on Saturday morning.
I opened up the first page,

24
00:01:29 --> 00:01:33
“Rare and aggressive HIV reported in
New York.”  I'll be talking to you

25
00:01:33 --> 00:01:37
about the HIV-1 virus which is the
virus that ends up destroying some

26
00:01:37 --> 00:01:42
of your major defender cells in the
immune system.

27
00:01:42 --> 00:01:46
And then people die of AIDS which
is sort of all the other stuff that

28
00:01:46 --> 00:01:51
then happens.  And it was terribly
scary when it first showed up.

29
00:01:51 --> 00:01:55
There was no treatment for it.
It's like that in most of the Third

30
00:01:55 --> 00:01:59
World and people die if they get it.
I lost a close friend to it after

31
00:01:59 --> 00:02:03
it first came up.
Then they came up with these various

32
00:02:03 --> 00:02:07
cocktails of different inhibitors.
And the idea was instead of just

33
00:02:07 --> 00:02:10
having a single drug target where it
would be easy for the virus to

34
00:02:10 --> 00:02:14
mutate and, as I'll tell you,
the HIV virus mutates like crazy.

35
00:02:14 --> 00:02:17
Instead they'd use multiple targets
and that's why they do it.

36
00:02:17 --> 00:02:21
And sort of then the chances of it
getting a mutation,

37
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
you multiply all these low
probabilities of getting a mutation

38
00:02:24 --> 00:02:28
and would hope it would never happen.
It's happened.

39
00:02:28 --> 00:02:31
There in New York is a version of
HIV-1 that is resistant to

40
00:02:31 --> 00:02:35
everything.  If that spreads,
which it probably will, it will be

41
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
just like what happened with all the
bacteria and antibiotics.

42
00:02:38 --> 00:02:42
It works for a little while,
natural mutation and natural

43
00:02:42 --> 00:02:45
selection, something will happen,
the organism or the virus will

44
00:02:45 --> 00:02:49
change so that it's no longer
resistant.  So,

45
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
you know, for the moment,
as always, you know, make sure you

46
00:02:52 --> 00:02:56
never expose yourself to AIDS.
This would take us back just like

47
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
to before any of these things
were inhibited.

48
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
And the same thing goes right now.
There are strains of mycobacterium

49
00:03:03 --> 00:03:06
tuberculosis that are resistant to
every known antibiotic.

50
00:03:06 --> 00:03:10
If you get tuberculosis with that
thing it's like you were living 200

51
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
years ago.  They cannot do anything
for you.  They'd put you in a

52
00:03:13 --> 00:03:17
sanatorium but you cannot be cured.
This is worse.  You know, this is

53
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
awful.  This one kills you.
So just be careful.  This is just

54
00:03:20 --> 00:03:24
the tip, but what always happens
when you have antibiotics or drug

55
00:03:24 --> 00:03:27
treatments eventually natural
selection mutation will probably

56
00:03:27 --> 00:03:31
produce a variant.
And this looks like it is happening.

57
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
I don't know, I hope not,
but I'm afraid this won't be the end

58
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
of this one.  OK.
So some of you, I've read some of

59
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
the comments.  I'm not terribly
surprised that some of you think why

60
00:03:42 --> 00:03:46
is he telling me all this.
God, there was a lot of work for

61
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
tremendously confusing,
there were all these chemical

62
00:03:49 --> 00:03:53
structures, I didn't really get it
all.  It seemed that somehow out of

63
00:03:53 --> 00:03:57
this the cell got to two molecules
of ATP.  Why are we wasting all the

64
00:03:57 --> 00:04:01
time?  Why am I wasting all this
time telling you about how to get

65
00:04:01 --> 00:04:06
two molecules of ATP?
This is basically what we were doing.

66
00:04:06 --> 00:04:12
We were looking at glucose,
which is C6H12O6, going through this

67
00:04:12 --> 00:04:19
process which pathway is of ten
enzymatic steps.

68
00:04:19 --> 00:04:26
And what ends up coming out at the
other end is two pyruvates.

69
00:04:26 --> 00:04:32
And the net yield of that is two
ATP plus two molecules of this weird

70
00:04:32 --> 00:04:37
thing called NADH.
Now, I think most of you,

71
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
although a few of you still don't
seem to have gotten it,

72
00:04:40 --> 00:04:44
the reason you need to make ATP out
of ADP and inorganic phosphate is it

73
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
stores energy.
It's, you know,

74
00:04:47 --> 00:04:50
like having electricity in your
house or batteries in your

75
00:04:50 --> 00:04:54
flashlight or in your iPod or
whatever it is.

76
00:04:54 --> 00:04:57
You've got to have energy in order
to do stuff.  And cells need it.

77
00:04:57 --> 00:05:01
And the major sort of energy
currency they use is ATP.

78
00:05:01 --> 00:05:04
And they put most of it by squeezing
together a phosphate up to an ATP

79
00:05:04 --> 00:05:08
making this bond that's stable,
unless there's an enzyme that'll

80
00:05:08 --> 00:05:12
break it open,
but there's energy stored in it.

81
00:05:12 --> 00:05:15
And they'll drop downhill and you
can use that energy to drive other

82
00:05:15 --> 00:05:19
reactions.  So for life to happen it
had to somehow figure out how to get

83
00:05:19 --> 00:05:23
energy in a form that it could use
to do all the biosynthesis that's

84
00:05:23 --> 00:05:27
necessary for life to go on.
NADH, I showed you the molecule,

85
00:05:27 --> 00:05:30
you got a structure.
The cell makes some number of

86
00:05:30 --> 00:05:34
molecules of that.
It's around.  And what happened,

87
00:05:34 --> 00:05:38
it comes in, it helped some of these
processes go.  It ends up,

88
00:05:38 --> 00:05:42
it's sort of like a banking system
for electrons.

89
00:05:42 --> 00:05:45
If it gets NADH it's got electrons
stuck on it.  There are only a

90
00:05:45 --> 00:05:49
limited number of molecules of NADH
in a cell, so if you make all the

91
00:05:49 --> 00:05:53
NAD molecules into NADH then you
have nowhere else to put electrons

92
00:05:53 --> 00:05:57
and everything comes to a grinding
halt.  Because I was talking about

93
00:05:57 --> 00:06:01
redox reactions.
If you're taking electrons off

94
00:06:01 --> 00:06:05
somewhere they've got to go
somewhere else.

95
00:06:05 --> 00:06:09
And the cell uses NADH as kind of
almost a currency for passing

96
00:06:09 --> 00:06:13
electrons around in just the same
way it uses ATP as a currency for

97
00:06:13 --> 00:06:18
carrying energy around from one form
or another.  Now,

98
00:06:18 --> 00:06:22
the problem was and why this was so
important is this apparently,

99
00:06:22 --> 00:06:26
as I said, we're basically looking
at an evolutionary fossil of some

100
00:06:26 --> 00:06:30
sort because every organism on earth
uses, or virtually every organism on

101
00:06:30 --> 00:06:35
earth uses glycolysis.
It's in our cytoplasm of our cells.

102
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
It's in the cytoplasm of bacteria.
It's in the cytoplasm of archaea.

103
00:06:39 --> 00:06:44
It apparently evolved so long ago
that every form of life on earth,

104
00:06:44 --> 00:06:48
you know, depends on this, anything
that can metabolize a sugar molecule

105
00:06:48 --> 00:06:53
pretty much.  And so it looks
complicated.  It is.

106
00:06:53 --> 00:06:57
Maybe you could have designed,
I'd like to tell you that it's two

107
00:06:57 --> 00:07:02
reactions and you make two ATPs and
it's all simple.

108
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
Life isn't often simple.
It's often very complicated.

109
00:07:04 --> 00:07:07
It wasn't done by a team of design
engineers in Building 10 designing

110
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
it.  It was done by something that
happened with random selection.

111
00:07:10 --> 00:07:13
And when something finally worked
apparently it got fixed in evolution

112
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
even if it looks clunky.
I think the other way to look at it

113
00:07:15 --> 00:07:18
is to say isn't that,
I feel a sort of sense of wonder at

114
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
this point, and granted I've had a
lot of years working in the field,

115
00:07:21 --> 00:07:24
that something that complicated
could work out and take this

116
00:07:24 --> 00:07:27
molecule of glucose and make it into
two molecules of ATP that can then

117
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
be used to allow the cell
to do synthesize.

118
00:07:30 --> 00:07:35
As in I'll show you,
there's a better way you could use

119
00:07:35 --> 00:07:40
this much more efficiently,
18 times more efficiently if we do

120
00:07:40 --> 00:07:45
respiration, which we'll talk about
today, but that needs oxygen.

121
00:07:45 --> 00:07:51
And when life started 3.8 billion
years ago or so there was no oxygen

122
00:07:51 --> 00:07:56
so it wasn't an option.
The initial organisms had to make

123
00:07:56 --> 00:08:02
due with what they found and this is
what developed.

124
00:08:02 --> 00:08:05
So ATP can go off and be used for
lots of things.

125
00:08:05 --> 00:08:09
The problem, if there's no oxygen
around, as I said there are a

126
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
limited number of molecules of ATP.
So to make that glycolysis go

127
00:08:12 --> 00:08:16
you're taking some electrons off and
doing the oxidation steps,

128
00:08:16 --> 00:08:19
you're reducing NADH.  And if you
want that to go as a cycle you've

129
00:08:19 --> 00:08:23
got to somehow regenerate the NAD+
so you can go through another cycle

130
00:08:23 --> 00:08:27
and make more ATP.
So there were two variants that I

131
00:08:27 --> 00:08:31
told you about.
If you don't have oxygen around,

132
00:08:31 --> 00:08:37
one of these variants yields to
lactate, and so the net yield of

133
00:08:37 --> 00:08:42
this is two ATP.
Because what happens in this part

134
00:08:42 --> 00:08:48
is it uses up two molecules of NADH
changing the two molecules of

135
00:08:48 --> 00:08:53
pyruvate to two molecules of lactate,
so that gets rid of this,

136
00:08:53 --> 00:08:59
and the net yield of the whole thing
is two molecules of ATP.

137
00:08:59 --> 00:09:03
The other way to do it is the way
yeast does it.

138
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
It makes two molecules of CO2 plus
two molecules of ethanol.

139
00:09:07 --> 00:09:11
And I think when I wrote that on
the board I showed you that there

140
00:09:11 --> 00:09:15
was acetaldehyde.
We had two molecules of that going

141
00:09:15 --> 00:09:19
to two molecules of ethanol.
And I think I forgot to write on

142
00:09:19 --> 00:09:23
the board that it used up two
molecules of NADH because that's

143
00:09:23 --> 00:09:27
important.  So that's what this
whole thing is about.

144
00:09:27 --> 00:09:31
It achieves the same thing.
And the net yield of this one is two

145
00:09:31 --> 00:09:35
ATPs as well.  So I'm going to talk
about photosynthesis at the latter

146
00:09:35 --> 00:09:39
part of the lecture,
but if you maybe recall the initial

147
00:09:39 --> 00:09:43
sort of thing I called “release one”
came up here about 3.

148
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47
billion years ago.  Later on an
improved version came along that

149
00:09:47 --> 00:09:51
started to generate oxygen.
Now, it took billions of years for

150
00:09:51 --> 00:09:55
us to get to our present level of
oxygen, but when oxygen became

151
00:09:55 --> 00:09:59
available in the atmosphere then
there was a new option

152
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02
for making energy.
And that was instead of taking this

153
00:10:02 --> 00:10:06
NADH and, remember,
there are about 50 kcals per mole of

154
00:10:06 --> 00:10:10
energy in there,
it's just being thrown away.

155
00:10:10 --> 00:10:13
It's not being used at all.  But if
there's oxygen around there's a new

156
00:10:13 --> 00:10:17
and better system,
which you know as respiration,

157
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
it's a word you've heard.  You know
we breathe oxygen.

158
00:10:20 --> 00:10:24
We need to breathe oxygen because
we're using the oxygen to make

159
00:10:24 --> 00:10:28
energy.  And I'll tell you again.
You don't have to know all the

160
00:10:28 --> 00:10:33
details.
But there's a biochemical cycle

161
00:10:33 --> 00:10:39
called a citric acid cycle.
And it goes together with another

162
00:10:39 --> 00:10:46
process that's known as oxidative
phosphorylation.

163
00:10:46 --> 00:10:55
And so this is if we have oxygen

164
00:10:55 --> 00:11:00
what we end up with at the end of
the day instead of these products is

165
00:11:00 --> 00:11:06
six molecules of CO2 plus
six molecules of water.

166
00:11:06 --> 00:11:14
But more importantly 36 molecules of
ATP.  So respiration is tremendously

167
00:11:14 --> 00:11:23
better at capturing energy from a
glucose molecule.

168
00:11:23 --> 00:11:31
But this, I'll show you,
is a later arriving development in

169
00:11:31 --> 00:11:37
evolution.
It had to be because it required

170
00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
oxygen in the atmosphere.
And so even though we only get two

171
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
molecules out of ATP.
We all do it.  And the other thing

172
00:11:43 --> 00:11:47
it generates is pyruvate.
And, as you'll see, this process

173
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
takes those pyruvates.
That's the starting material for

174
00:11:50 --> 00:11:53
this part over here.
OK?  I hope this is making a bit

175
00:11:53 --> 00:11:56
more sense as to why you've got to
keep your eye on the big picture or

176
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
all you're going to see is a whole
lot of structures and chemical

177
00:11:59 --> 00:12:03
transformations that don't
make any sense.

178
00:12:03 --> 00:12:07
This is all about making ATP and
energy.  And, as we'll see later on,

179
00:12:07 --> 00:12:11
photosynthesis.  In cases it can be
something to do with making reducing

180
00:12:11 --> 00:12:15
power for biosynthesis.
So in order to understand this,

181
00:12:15 --> 00:12:19
though, I have to introduce you to
another way of thinking about energy.

182
00:12:19 --> 00:12:23
Some of you still seem to be
struggling with the idea that you

183
00:12:23 --> 00:12:27
can store energy in a chemical bond,
but I think from the comments the

184
00:12:27 --> 00:12:32
majority of you have that.
If you're having trouble,

185
00:12:32 --> 00:12:37
ask your TA or look in sections and
stuff.  But the insight to how this

186
00:12:37 --> 00:12:42
part came, even though this process,
what underlies this was invented

187
00:12:42 --> 00:12:47
about roughly 3.
billion years ago,

188
00:12:47 --> 00:12:52
scientists didn't begin to even get
a glimmer of how this worked until

189
00:12:52 --> 00:12:57
about 1961 when there was a
scientist named Peter Mitchell who

190
00:12:57 --> 00:13:02
got a Nobel Prize for the
insight that he had.

191
00:13:02 --> 00:13:07
And what he recognized was there
were sort of three forms of energy

192
00:13:07 --> 00:13:13
that are interconvertable.
The energy of a chemical bond.

193
00:13:13 --> 00:13:18
And I keep telling you this, that
ATP, if we hydrolyze that it goes to

194
00:13:18 --> 00:13:24
ATP plus inorganic phosphate.
The delta G prime zero is about

195
00:13:24 --> 00:13:29
minus 7 kilocalories per mole,
but under physiological conditions

196
00:13:29 --> 00:13:35
it works out that each ATP gets you
about 12 kilocalories per mole

197
00:13:35 --> 00:13:41
because life doesn't happen under
these standard conditions.

198
00:13:41 --> 00:13:44
So that's one form of energy we've
been talking a lot about.

199
00:13:44 --> 00:13:47
There's another form of energy,
which you probably know intuitively,

200
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
and that is if you have a high
concentration of some compound on a

201
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
side of a sort of impermeable
barrier and a low concentration on

202
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56
the other side,
high concentration of sugar,

203
00:13:56 --> 00:14:00
low concentration of sugar.
If you give the system a chance it

204
00:14:00 --> 00:14:04
will come to equilibrium.
So the concentrated stuff will flow

205
00:14:04 --> 00:14:09
downhill until you're concentrated
on both sides.

206
00:14:09 --> 00:14:14
There's energy that you could get
out of that.  So there's energy

207
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
basically stored in a concentration
gradient.  There's another form

208
00:14:18 --> 00:14:23
which should probably be familiar
certainly to some of you,

209
00:14:23 --> 00:14:28
and that's the idea you can store
energy in an electrical gradient.

210
00:14:28 --> 00:14:32
If you have some kind of impermeable
barrier and we have a lot of charges

211
00:14:32 --> 00:14:36
on one side and less charges on the
other side then there's a polarity,

212
00:14:36 --> 00:14:40
there's an electrical gradient, and
that's a form of stored energy.

213
00:14:40 --> 00:14:44
Now, it happens that a membrane is
impermeable, as I've told you,

214
00:14:44 --> 00:14:48
to most things.  So you can get a
high concentration of something on

215
00:14:48 --> 00:14:52
one side and a low concentration on
the other and controlled by a

216
00:14:52 --> 00:14:56
protein imbedded in it,
whether those ever get a chance to

217
00:14:56 --> 00:15:00
come across.  The same idea applies
for an electrical gradient.

218
00:15:00 --> 00:15:06
And in particular of interest to
biology are hydrogen ions.

219
00:15:06 --> 00:15:12
So if we have a situation like this
where we have more hydrogen ions on

220
00:15:12 --> 00:15:18
one side of a membrane than another
then we have an electrical gradient,

221
00:15:18 --> 00:15:24
we have a polarity.  And so this is
the membrane.  And so all

222
00:15:24 --> 00:15:35
cells then have --

223
00:15:35 --> 00:15:39
And the way it works is this is the
outside of the cell and this is the

224
00:15:39 --> 00:15:44
inside of the cell,
so more pluses on the outside,

225
00:15:44 --> 00:15:49
hydrogen ions on the outside than
the inside.  And it's about 70

226
00:15:49 --> 00:15:54
millivolts.  It may not sound that
impressive, right?

227
00:15:54 --> 00:15:59
Another way to look at it,
though, is the membrane is about

228
00:15:59 --> 00:16:04
three nanometers.
So if you say,

229
00:16:04 --> 00:16:08
well, OK, what's the electrical
gradient across that?

230
00:16:08 --> 00:16:12
It's about 200,000 volts per
centimeter.  And high tension lines

231
00:16:12 --> 00:16:17
are, you know,
more like that per mile or something

232
00:16:17 --> 00:16:21
like that.  So although it seems
modest because the membranes,

233
00:16:21 --> 00:16:25
you've got have a very, very
powerful electrical gradient in all

234
00:16:25 --> 00:16:30
cells.  And so this is
a form of energy.

235
00:16:30 --> 00:16:34
And I think this was proposed in
1961.  Textbooks often say it was

236
00:16:34 --> 00:16:38
adopted in the early 70s.
I went to a post-doc at Berkley in

237
00:16:38 --> 00:16:42
1975 and people were still having
arguments about whether this really

238
00:16:42 --> 00:16:46
was the way, was this really
something that was used in nature?

239
00:16:46 --> 00:16:50
It is.  And I think one of the most
dramatic demonstrations that a

240
00:16:50 --> 00:16:54
proton gradient can be a source of
energy comes from this sort of thing.

241
00:16:54 --> 00:16:58
I'd showed you how this bacteria,
these are E. coli swimming around

242
00:16:58 --> 00:17:02
with these rotary motors that spin
10,000 to 100,000 RPM driving

243
00:17:02 --> 00:17:05
those flagella.
I showed you the picture of the

244
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
inner membrane of E.
coli.  And I mentioned it has a

245
00:17:08 --> 00:17:11
double membrane.
This is sort of a protective layer.

246
00:17:11 --> 00:17:14
You'll see, a little bit later in
the lecture, some double membranes

247
00:17:14 --> 00:17:18
again.  And here's the motor with
the big propeller,

248
00:17:18 --> 00:17:21
the flagella sticking out from it.
And the way this thing, and I

249
00:17:21 --> 00:17:24
showed you, I guess,
this picture and then this textbook

250
00:17:24 --> 00:17:27
diagram.
What drives this motor are protons

251
00:17:27 --> 00:17:31
flowing from the outside of the cell
through here, through the proteins

252
00:17:31 --> 00:17:35
in here, through channels in them.
And that's what provides the torque

253
00:17:35 --> 00:17:39
for the motor.
That's what drives it.

254
00:17:39 --> 00:17:43
It's not ATP or anything.
It's protons on the outside and

255
00:17:43 --> 00:17:47
inside.  And there's a very dramatic
demonstration that's sort of like

256
00:17:47 --> 00:17:51
Friday night horror films,
[if you will?], where people found a

257
00:17:51 --> 00:17:55
way of popping an E.
coli open so that all of the

258
00:17:55 --> 00:17:59
cytoplasm ran out and then
it would reseal.

259
00:17:59 --> 00:18:02
So what you've got is sort of an E.
coli that is just a shell, just the

260
00:18:02 --> 00:18:06
membranes and the proteins imbedded
in it, and it just sits there at

261
00:18:06 --> 00:18:09
neutral pH.  If you now acidify the
medium what's happened is you've

262
00:18:09 --> 00:18:13
created a proton gradient because
there are now more protons on the

263
00:18:13 --> 00:18:17
outside.  And this is just the same
picture I showed you before.

264
00:18:17 --> 00:18:20
But what happens if you do that
experiment is the bacteria start

265
00:18:20 --> 00:18:24
swimming.  They don't have any
insides or anything but you have

266
00:18:24 --> 00:18:28
created artificially a proton
gradient and it drives the motor and

267
00:18:28 --> 00:18:32
they start swimming.
It's sort of like “dead man walking”

268
00:18:32 --> 00:18:38
or something at a bacteria level.
I think it's a really dramatic

269
00:18:38 --> 00:18:43
demonstration of how you can use the
energy of a proton gradient to make

270
00:18:43 --> 00:18:49
energy.  So the principle that
underlies how respiration works and

271
00:18:49 --> 00:18:54
photosynthesis works is that you
take advantage of this combination

272
00:18:54 --> 00:19:00
of concentration and electrical
gradient.

273
00:19:00 --> 00:19:10
And it's known as the chemi --

274
00:19:10 --> 00:19:13
-- osmotic hypothesis.
Because here you have an electrical

275
00:19:13 --> 00:19:17
gradient because of the charges.
You also have a concentration

276
00:19:17 --> 00:19:20
gradient because you've got more
hydrogen ions on this side.

277
00:19:20 --> 00:19:24
So you cannot really separate them.
They're kind of coupled.  But the

278
00:19:24 --> 00:19:28
idea is that life uses this proton
gradient in order to make energy and

279
00:19:28 --> 00:19:32
do some of these energy
transactions.

280
00:19:32 --> 00:19:35
So here's the sort of principle of
how it's done.

281
00:19:35 --> 00:19:39
You have a membrane like this,
then we have a protein, and now

282
00:19:39 --> 00:19:42
we're not going to see all the alpha
helices and beta sheets.

283
00:19:42 --> 00:19:46
It'll be one of those things we
talked about that spans the membrane.

284
00:19:46 --> 00:19:49
The membrane,
as you might guess from what you

285
00:19:49 --> 00:19:53
know about it,
is impermeable to hydrogen ions.

286
00:19:53 --> 00:19:57
So what this protein does that's
imbedded in the membrane,

287
00:19:57 --> 00:20:00
it's a proton pump.
And if you provide it with energy in

288
00:20:00 --> 00:20:04
some form what it does is it takes a
hydrogen ion that's on the inside

289
00:20:04 --> 00:20:08
and it makes it into a hydrogen ion
on the outside.

290
00:20:08 --> 00:20:11
There's no chemical transformation
of the proton.

291
00:20:11 --> 00:20:15
It's just gone from one side of the
membrane to the other.

292
00:20:15 --> 00:20:19
It's almost like recharging a
battery or something if you want to

293
00:20:19 --> 00:20:23
think about it perhaps in
that kind of way.

294
00:20:23 --> 00:20:32
And then the second stage is once
the proton gradient is established

295
00:20:32 --> 00:20:42
and you have now many more H+s on
the outside than on the inside then

296
00:20:42 --> 00:20:52
there is another protein that lets
the proton flow.

297
00:20:52 --> 00:21:02
The proton flows down to gradient
and therefore is able to come back

298
00:21:02 --> 00:21:09
inside the cell.
Now, if that's all there was to it

299
00:21:09 --> 00:21:14
we wouldn't have achieved anything.
We would have wasted energy, pump

300
00:21:14 --> 00:21:18
something out,
pump something back.

301
00:21:18 --> 00:21:23
But this molecule has an
interesting property,

302
00:21:23 --> 00:21:28
and that is the ability of the
proton to flow down the gradient

303
00:21:28 --> 00:21:33
obligatorily requires ATP plus
inorganic phosphate.

304
00:21:33 --> 00:21:37
And as the proton comes down this
energy gradient there's enough

305
00:21:37 --> 00:21:41
energy given off by that the cell is
able to capture it and use that

306
00:21:41 --> 00:21:45
energy to synthesize a molecule of
ATP.  Got it?  So you produce some

307
00:21:45 --> 00:21:50
energy like from the light in
photosynthesis that we'll see in a

308
00:21:50 --> 00:21:54
minute, other ways of doing it,
and then get it outside.  Once

309
00:21:54 --> 00:21:59
you've got the gradient
now you can make ATP.

310
00:21:59 --> 00:22:04
And, actually,
one of the completely remarkable

311
00:22:04 --> 00:22:10
discoveries of structural biology,
this is known as an ATP synthase.

312
00:22:10 --> 00:22:15
It's a protein.
It's an enzyme.

313
00:22:15 --> 00:22:21
These are the kinds of things we've
been talking about.

314
00:22:21 --> 00:22:27
This is also a protein.
You see all the different things

315
00:22:27 --> 00:22:31
proteins do.
So this ATP synthase,

316
00:22:31 --> 00:22:35
which uses this energy of the proton
gradient to make ATP,

317
00:22:35 --> 00:22:39
its structure has been worked out
and at a level,

318
00:22:39 --> 00:22:43
here's part of the crystal structure.
You can probably see some alpha

319
00:22:43 --> 00:22:47
helices beta sheets.
Here's a textbook diagram of it

320
00:22:47 --> 00:22:51
showing, it's upside down I'm
showing, but here's a proton on the

321
00:22:51 --> 00:22:55
inside flowing across.
And what's remarkable is it turns

322
00:22:55 --> 00:22:59
out that this ATP synthase is
structurally related to the protein

323
00:22:59 --> 00:23:03
that's at the heart of that rotary
motor that drives the flagella.

324
00:23:03 --> 00:23:06
And, in fact, remember,
I think I showed you where you could

325
00:23:06 --> 00:23:09
stick the flagella to a cover slip
and the bacteria twirled around so

326
00:23:09 --> 00:23:12
you could actually see they were
rotating?  So people did sort of the

327
00:23:12 --> 00:23:15
equivalent thing,
they managed to stick this ATP

328
00:23:15 --> 00:23:18
synthase.  And you couldn't see that
the top part was turning,

329
00:23:18 --> 00:23:21
but they used some tricky stuff
we'll talk about with antibodies and

330
00:23:21 --> 00:23:24
there's something to attach a long
filamentous molecule.

331
00:23:24 --> 00:23:27
It's the polymer of proton called
actin.  That's the same stuff we

332
00:23:27 --> 00:23:31
find in our muscles.
And it made it long enough.

333
00:23:31 --> 00:23:35
You could see that when this thing
was working that it was twirling

334
00:23:35 --> 00:23:40
around.  And so evolution took this
same basic sort of piece of protein

335
00:23:40 --> 00:23:44
machinery.  And in one case it used
it to capture the energy of a proton

336
00:23:44 --> 00:23:48
gradient and make ATP.
And in another case it used it to

337
00:23:48 --> 00:23:53
drive this propeller,
if you will.  And here's sort of a

338
00:23:53 --> 00:23:57
simple diagram.
So as the proton flows kind of what

339
00:23:57 --> 00:24:02
happens is the inner part of this
thing sort of goes click, click.

340
00:24:02 --> 00:24:05
And every time it does it
synthesizes an ATP.

341
00:24:05 --> 00:24:09
And it sort of takes that energy to
push together the ADP and the

342
00:24:09 --> 00:24:12
inorganic phosphate overcoming that
activation energy and getting them

343
00:24:12 --> 00:24:16
close enough that you're able to get
that bond.  It's a truly remarkable

344
00:24:16 --> 00:24:20
thing.  This is a somewhat hard
concept to grasp,

345
00:24:20 --> 00:24:23
I understand, but if you can
understand this endocrine

346
00:24:23 --> 00:24:27
variability between energy in the
form of a combined concentration of

347
00:24:27 --> 00:24:31
electrical gradient and ATP,
and nature goes back and back and

348
00:24:31 --> 00:24:35
forth, it's absolutely
fundamental to life.

349
00:24:35 --> 00:24:38
If we didn't have this stuff going
on we couldn't do it.

350
00:24:38 --> 00:24:41
You know, as I say with glycolysis,
I wish it was simpler, but this is

351
00:24:41 --> 00:24:44
the way nature did it,
this is the way we are,

352
00:24:44 --> 00:24:47
and [what I know about?] biology
this is how it goes.

353
00:24:47 --> 00:24:50
And I wouldn't be doing it justice
if I didn't tell you some of the

354
00:24:50 --> 00:24:54
details.  You're MIT students.
You should be able to, I hope,

355
00:24:54 --> 00:24:57
some of how the world actually works
at this kind of level.

356
00:24:57 --> 00:25:00
OK.  Now, with that kind of
background, I think

357
00:25:00 --> 00:25:04
we can kind of --
Pretty quickly I can help you begin

358
00:25:04 --> 00:25:08
to see what happens here.
Now, remember the problem up there

359
00:25:08 --> 00:25:12
with glycolysis?
It started when there was no oxygen,

360
00:25:12 --> 00:25:16
and therefore it generated these
NADHs.  They weren't any good.

361
00:25:16 --> 00:25:20
You had to just get rid of them so
you took the pyruvate,

362
00:25:20 --> 00:25:24
organisms learned how to put them to
make lactate or ethanol and carbon

363
00:25:24 --> 00:25:28
dioxide, but if there's oxygen
around then there's another

364
00:25:28 --> 00:25:33
possibility.
And that is you can combine these

365
00:25:33 --> 00:25:40
molecules with oxygen.
So if we take two NADH plus two

366
00:25:40 --> 00:25:47
hydrogen ions plus a molecule of
oxygen what we get is two waters.

367
00:25:47 --> 00:25:54
And I think I can show you what's
going on there kind of simply.

368
00:25:54 --> 00:26:01
What NADH was, we got a pair of
electrons here and a hydrogen ion.

369
00:26:01 --> 00:26:05
Well, if we took that,
what's that?  I think you'd

370
00:26:05 --> 00:26:10
recognize it as a molecule of
hydrogen gas.  So if you take NADH

371
00:26:10 --> 00:26:15
and oxygen, what the cell is really
essentially doing,

372
00:26:15 --> 00:26:20
it's taking hydrogen gas plus oxygen
and it's giving two waters.

373
00:26:20 --> 00:26:24
So it's basically burning hydrogen.
And I think most of you know what

374
00:26:24 --> 00:26:29
would happen if I had a mixture of
hydrogen and oxygen up here and

375
00:26:29 --> 00:26:34
chucked a match at it or something.
We'd have a massive explosion.

376
00:26:34 --> 00:26:38
And, in fact, that's why there are
50 kilocalories of energy released

377
00:26:38 --> 00:26:42
when that happens.
And so on an energy sort of diagram,

378
00:26:42 --> 00:26:47
these free energy diagrams where we
had the two NADH here plus the

379
00:26:47 --> 00:26:51
molecule of oxygen,
and down here we have the two

380
00:26:51 --> 00:26:55
molecules of water,
there is this.  If that happened in

381
00:26:55 --> 00:27:00
one step it would be a huge
amount of energy.

382
00:27:00 --> 00:27:04
No cell or organism on earth has
figured out how to do that in one

383
00:27:04 --> 00:27:08
step.  And I think some of the
textbooks liken it to sort of say it

384
00:27:08 --> 00:27:12
would be like setting a stick of
dynamite off in the cell.

385
00:27:12 --> 00:27:16
And this is where one of these
things that seemed probably like a

386
00:27:16 --> 00:27:20
kind of uninteresting thermodynamic
property, to some extent,

387
00:27:20 --> 00:27:24
becomes to be really important in
understanding biology.

388
00:27:24 --> 00:27:28
And that is the fact that remember
I said this drop in energy from

389
00:27:28 --> 00:27:32
reactants to products was a
thermodynamic property?

390
00:27:32 --> 00:27:35
It didn't matter whether like you
skied straight down the hill or you

391
00:27:35 --> 00:27:38
came down in a series of little
things, you still got the same

392
00:27:38 --> 00:27:42
amount of energy release going from
here down to there.

393
00:27:42 --> 00:27:45
So that's, in essence,
what the cell does, is it takes this

394
00:27:45 --> 00:27:48
energy and it breaks it into little
packages that it's able to manage in

395
00:27:48 --> 00:27:52
a chemical way.
And so instead of coming down,

396
00:27:52 --> 00:27:55
and once it comes down in a series
of steps, and every time it flows

397
00:27:55 --> 00:27:59
partway down hill it
does something.

398
00:27:59 --> 00:28:04
And what it does is it passes two
electrons to some kind of carrier.

399
00:28:04 --> 00:28:09
And then the two electrons flow
downhill a little bit to another one

400
00:28:09 --> 00:28:15
and then to another one.
And what happens when these

401
00:28:15 --> 00:28:20
electrons are flowing downhill,
though, is that they drive that

402
00:28:20 --> 00:28:26
proton pump.  So a proton pump takes
the proton from being on the outside

403
00:28:26 --> 00:28:31
to the inside.
And when the two electrons drop

404
00:28:31 --> 00:28:37
down to the next level another H+
goes from out to H+ in, again here.

405
00:28:37 --> 00:28:49
And if you understood what I said

406
00:28:49 --> 00:28:54
before, what the cell can now do is
it can make three ATPs by using that

407
00:28:54 --> 00:28:59
ATP synthesis,
and now taking advantage of those

408
00:28:59 --> 00:29:05
three pump proteins and making them
into three ATPs.

409
00:29:05 --> 00:29:11
And then at the end of the day what
happens then is these two electrons

410
00:29:11 --> 00:29:18
get together with two hydrogen ions
plus I'll show it as a half of an

411
00:29:18 --> 00:29:26
oxygen here to give you water.
And what's happening up here is,

412
00:29:26 --> 00:29:34
in essence, the molecule of sugar,
C6H1206 is being burned with six

413
00:29:34 --> 00:29:42
molecules of water plus this to give
you six molecules of C02 plus six

414
00:29:42 --> 00:29:50
molecules of ATP so that the cell is
essentially achieving the same kind

415
00:29:50 --> 00:29:58
of thing by this process as if it
had burned it in oxygen.

416
00:29:58 --> 00:30:06
There's that much potential energy
released.  And the total amount of

417
00:30:06 --> 00:30:14
this change in the d-prime zero is
something out of the order of I

418
00:30:14 --> 00:30:22
think it's minus 686 kilocalories
per mole.  It's able to capture

419
00:30:22 --> 00:30:30
respiration.  It captures about 60%
of that energy as ATP.

420
00:30:30 --> 00:30:38
This process of fermentation,
this is what these processes that

421
00:30:38 --> 00:30:46
happen in the absence of oxygen are
known as fermentation.

422
00:30:46 --> 00:30:54
As you can see, there much less
efficient.  It gets more like 3.

423
00:30:54 --> 00:31:01
% of the energy captured as ATP.
So you can see when oxygen arose in

424
00:31:01 --> 00:31:05
the environment what a huge boom it
was to life because you could get a

425
00:31:05 --> 00:31:09
lot more energy for the same amount
of starting material.

426
00:31:09 --> 00:31:13
There is one thing, though,
that the cell has to do.  In order

427
00:31:13 --> 00:31:17
to do this it has to do some more
chemistry because it has to take

428
00:31:17 --> 00:31:21
those pyruvates and it has to
somehow run them through this thing

429
00:31:21 --> 00:31:25
that I'm called the citric acid
cycle and oxidative

430
00:31:25 --> 00:31:30
phosphorylation.
Well, the oxidative phosphorylation

431
00:31:30 --> 00:31:34
is basically this chain I've
diagramed for you here in a

432
00:31:34 --> 00:31:38
schematic way.
And that's about the level you'll

433
00:31:38 --> 00:31:42
have to understand it.
I mean physically it's going to be

434
00:31:42 --> 00:31:46
a bunch of proteins stuck in the
membrane, and as the electrons get

435
00:31:46 --> 00:31:50
passed along they pump a proton as
this pathway occurs.

436
00:31:50 --> 00:31:54
But the other thing the cells have
to do is they have to take those two

437
00:31:54 --> 00:31:59
pyruvates and they have to burn them
all the way down to C02 and water.

438
00:31:59 --> 00:32:03
And what's happening,
if you remember that chain of

439
00:32:03 --> 00:32:07
oxidations, the carbons are being
successfully oxidized all the way up

440
00:32:07 --> 00:32:11
to carbon dioxide.
You cannot be anymore oxidized than

441
00:32:11 --> 00:32:15
that if you're carbon.
What that must mean is something

442
00:32:15 --> 00:32:19
else is getting reduced.
And what gets reduced, where the

443
00:32:19 --> 00:32:23
electrons go is NADHs.
So once oxygen became available in

444
00:32:23 --> 00:32:27
the atmosphere then the name of the
game was to take those two pyruvates

445
00:32:27 --> 00:32:31
and to somehow burn them all the way
down to here, and therefore generate

446
00:32:31 --> 00:32:36
as much NADH as possible.
And if you can make some ATPs along

447
00:32:36 --> 00:32:40
the way well and good.
So there had to be a whole other

448
00:32:40 --> 00:32:44
set of chemical reactions that's
every bit as complicated as

449
00:32:44 --> 00:32:48
glycolysis that emerged in nature,
that carried out that job.  And this

450
00:32:48 --> 00:32:52
time I'm not going to take you
through all of the chemical

451
00:32:52 --> 00:32:56
structures.  You can look at it in
your textbook and stuff,

452
00:32:56 --> 00:33:00
but what I really want you to kind
of take is to keep your eye on the

453
00:33:00 --> 00:33:05
number of carbons.
If you look at the structure of

454
00:33:05 --> 00:33:10
pyruvate you'll see that it's three
carbons, and it was this.

455
00:33:10 --> 00:33:15
Here's the keto group and an acidic
group.  So this is almost carbon

456
00:33:15 --> 00:33:21
dioxide.  It's just one oxidative
step away.  So what happens in this

457
00:33:21 --> 00:33:26
cycle is that first the carbon
dioxide is removed and this

458
00:33:26 --> 00:33:34
makes an acetate.

459
00:33:34 --> 00:33:38
In essence it's actually joined to
something right here.

460
00:33:38 --> 00:33:43
And then this feeds into this thing
called the citric acid cycle.

461
00:33:43 --> 00:33:48
And what it is, as I said, is it's
a set of chemical reactions that are

462
00:33:48 --> 00:33:52
designed to take this pyruvate and
burn it all the way to carbon

463
00:33:52 --> 00:33:57
dioxide and water,
and to generate as many NADHs and

464
00:33:57 --> 00:34:02
ATPs as it can along the way.
And, again, I wish it were simpler.

465
00:34:02 --> 00:34:06
It would be really nice if it just
did it straight from acetate,

466
00:34:06 --> 00:34:10
but instead you'll see, if you look
at the TCA cycle,

467
00:34:10 --> 00:34:14
the C4 compound.  And this gets
joined together to give us C6

468
00:34:14 --> 00:34:18
compound.  And then it oxidizes one
of these carbons to give a carbon

469
00:34:18 --> 00:34:22
dioxide.  Now you're down to the C5.
It does it again, another molecule

470
00:34:22 --> 00:34:26
of C02, you're at C4.
And then it takes this C4 carbon

471
00:34:26 --> 00:34:30
skeleton, puts it through some
transformations that enables this

472
00:34:30 --> 00:34:36
cycle to go all over again.
So basically the C4 thing just goes

473
00:34:36 --> 00:34:42
through the cycle.
It's a carrier that takes this C2

474
00:34:42 --> 00:34:48
right here, lets it be processed to
give two molecules of C02.

475
00:34:48 --> 00:34:54
In that process it generates more
NADH, a bit of ATP,

476
00:34:54 --> 00:35:00
and a kind of reduced carrier that
you can think of for the moment

477
00:35:00 --> 00:35:07
largely equivalently to NADH.
OK.  Now, the entity in our cells

478
00:35:07 --> 00:35:15
that carries out this process
of respiration --

479
00:35:15 --> 00:35:24
Of respiration.

480
00:35:24 --> 00:35:28
So the citric acid cycle and the
mitochondria is not actually in our

481
00:35:28 --> 00:35:32
cytoplasm, which is perhaps
surprising, but all the enzymes for

482
00:35:32 --> 00:35:37
glycolysis are.
So remember my simple diagram of the

483
00:35:37 --> 00:35:41
eukaryotic cell one the first day?
We had the nucleus which is a

484
00:35:41 --> 00:35:45
membrane compartment that has the
DNA inside it,

485
00:35:45 --> 00:35:49
and we'll have more to say about
that in the next lecture of so,

486
00:35:49 --> 00:35:54
but then there were some organelles.
And one of them I said was the

487
00:35:54 --> 00:35:58
mitochondrion.
And I also said in the first

488
00:35:58 --> 00:36:02
lecture that there's pretty good
evidence now that the mitochondrion

489
00:36:02 --> 00:36:06
arose by some earlier progenitor or
ancestor of a eukaryotic cell

490
00:36:06 --> 00:36:11
capturing some kind of bacterium.
It's actually one that's sort of

491
00:36:11 --> 00:36:15
kind of related to E.
coli.  It had double membranes.

492
00:36:15 --> 00:36:20
And the mitochondria actually still
have some of their own DNA,

493
00:36:20 --> 00:36:24
but this is where all the energy,
all the enzymes for the citric acid

494
00:36:24 --> 00:36:32
cycle --

495
00:36:32 --> 00:36:37
-- and oxidative phosphorylation are
found in the inside of the

496
00:36:37 --> 00:36:42
mitochondrion,
instead of something that probably

497
00:36:42 --> 00:36:47
used to be a free-living bacterium.
In contrast, the enzymes for

498
00:36:47 --> 00:36:52
glycolysis are in what's called the
cytoplasm of the cell,

499
00:36:52 --> 00:36:57
which is sort of the main part of
the insides of the cell.

500
00:36:57 --> 00:37:00
So you see even here this sort of
evolutionary history that I kind of

501
00:37:00 --> 00:37:04
put out across the board.
The enzymes for glycolysis arose so

502
00:37:04 --> 00:37:07
early in evolution they're in the
cytoplasm of virtually every

503
00:37:07 --> 00:37:11
organism on earth.
Eukaryotic cells manage to figure

504
00:37:11 --> 00:37:14
out how to get 18 times more energy
for a molecule of sugar,

505
00:37:14 --> 00:37:18
but in order to do it they kind of
had to cheat.  They took a bacterium

506
00:37:18 --> 00:37:21
and figured out how to do it,
put it inside our own cells, and

507
00:37:21 --> 00:37:25
then it's able to run now,
it's become a part of our cell and

508
00:37:25 --> 00:37:29
it's where all the process
takes place.

509
00:37:29 --> 00:37:34
And if you look at a structure of a
mitochondrion it's actually got two

510
00:37:34 --> 00:37:40
membranes.  You just saw a picture
of that, an E.

511
00:37:40 --> 00:37:45
coli.  And it's sort of involuted a
little bit like this.

512
00:37:45 --> 00:37:51
And so this is an outer membrane of
a mitochondrion.

513
00:37:51 --> 00:37:57
So I'm basically taking this and
blowing it up.  So this

514
00:37:57 --> 00:38:02
is a mitochondrion.
And the in and the out,

515
00:38:02 --> 00:38:07
in this case there's an inner
membrane.  This is where the proton

516
00:38:07 --> 00:38:11
pump is located.
This is where the ATP synthesis is

517
00:38:11 --> 00:38:16
located.  And when a mitochondrion
is working what it's doing is it's

518
00:38:16 --> 00:38:21
pumping hydrogen ions from its
inside, which is more or less the

519
00:38:21 --> 00:38:25
equivalent of its cytoplasm,
it's whatever used to be the

520
00:38:25 --> 00:38:30
cytoplasm of the original bacterium,
outside into the space between the

521
00:38:30 --> 00:38:35
inner and outer membranes.
And then it generates ATP by flowing

522
00:38:35 --> 00:38:39
back down.  OK.
So there are a couple of sort of

523
00:38:39 --> 00:38:43
things that affect your life that
come out of this.

524
00:38:43 --> 00:38:48
One of them is understanding the
“freshman five” or “freshman

525
00:38:48 --> 00:38:52
fifteen” or whatever it is.
You come to college and all of a

526
00:38:52 --> 00:38:57
sudden you put on a lot of weight.
Sometimes you can figure it out

527
00:38:57 --> 00:39:01
because you ate a lot of Ben &
Jerry's or a lot of chocolate bars

528
00:39:01 --> 00:39:06
or something and didn't
do as much exercise.

529
00:39:06 --> 00:39:09
Another one of you said,
gee, now I understand why I'm not

530
00:39:09 --> 00:39:12
putting on any weight.
I do water polo, and I guess I must

531
00:39:12 --> 00:39:15
be burning up everything I eat as
energy.  And you're right,

532
00:39:15 --> 00:39:18
but now I can show you at a
molecular level what's happening.

533
00:39:18 --> 00:39:21
So what happens, your body,
everything is regulated,

534
00:39:21 --> 00:39:25
and it can tell if it needs,
cells in your body can tell if it

535
00:39:25 --> 00:39:28
needs energy.  If it needs energy
and you eat sugar it runs right

536
00:39:28 --> 00:39:32
through here and it makes ATP.
But if you've eaten enough and the

537
00:39:32 --> 00:39:36
things that monitor your body say
that you've got enough ATP then it

538
00:39:36 --> 00:39:41
doesn't keep this process going.
Instead what it does is it stops it

539
00:39:41 --> 00:39:46
and says instead we're going to put
something away for a rainy day,

540
00:39:46 --> 00:39:50
which you could see makes a lot of
sense in evolution.

541
00:39:50 --> 00:39:55
You know, if things are good you
just kill the mammoth and you can

542
00:39:55 --> 00:40:00
all eat well for a while
or something.

543
00:40:00 --> 00:40:05
It would make sense for your body to
be able to pack stuff away.

544
00:40:05 --> 00:40:10
So what it does is it intercepts
the process at this level,

545
00:40:10 --> 00:40:16
at this C2 level.  The pyruvate gets
to here, and instead of being run

546
00:40:16 --> 00:40:21
through this in ATP this acetate or
acetyl moiety which is a C2 gets run

547
00:40:21 --> 00:40:26
through a cycle of successive two
carbon additions.

548
00:40:26 --> 00:40:32
And what comes out of that are
fatty acids.  It also takes

549
00:40:32 --> 00:40:43
three phosphor --

550
00:40:43 --> 00:40:47
-- glyceraldehyde.
You might remember that.

551
00:40:47 --> 00:40:52
That's one of the products stuck in
the middle of that glycolytic

552
00:40:52 --> 00:40:57
pathway.  So this is a three carbon
compound.  It makes it into glycerol

553
00:40:57 --> 00:41:02
which is a three carbon compound.
And if you look back when we talked

554
00:41:02 --> 00:41:07
about lipids a couple of lectures
ago you'll realize what happens if

555
00:41:07 --> 00:41:12
you combine fatty acids with
glycerol then you've got fats.

556
00:41:12 --> 00:41:17
And, in essence, I mean that's what
happens.  We put on weight if we eat

557
00:41:17 --> 00:41:22
more than we're burning.
Our bodies say, OK, I've got as

558
00:41:22 --> 00:41:27
much ATP as we need.
I'm going to take some of that ATP

559
00:41:27 --> 00:41:31
and use it in this kind of way.
Just a second here.

560
00:41:31 --> 00:41:37
I'm going to see --

561
00:41:37 --> 00:41:41
So there's another thing that
happens, a physiological thing that

562
00:41:41 --> 00:41:45
we experience.
Well, we seem to be stuck at the

563
00:41:45 --> 00:41:49
moment.  I won't worry about it.
I've run some marathons.  I don't

564
00:41:49 --> 00:41:53
know.  A few of you may have.
If not almost all of you have heard

565
00:41:53 --> 00:41:57
about “hitting the wall”.
And it happens generally around 21,

566
00:41:57 --> 00:42:01
22, 23 miles.
It depends on the condition you're

567
00:42:01 --> 00:42:05
doing.  And physiologically I have
experienced, this is amazing,

568
00:42:05 --> 00:42:08
I understand why they call it
hitting the wall.

569
00:42:08 --> 00:42:11
You're running along and you think,
boy, I'm tired but I'm doing OK.

570
00:42:11 --> 00:42:15
And in a space of a quarter of mile
it's like you banged into a brick

571
00:42:15 --> 00:42:18
wall.  And you can sort of keep
yourself going but it's a profound

572
00:42:18 --> 00:42:22
physiological change.
And what has happened at that point

573
00:42:22 --> 00:42:25
is you've run out of sugar to burn.
Now, I've told you, you can take

574
00:42:25 --> 00:42:29
sugars and you can polymerize
them into glycogen.

575
00:42:29 --> 00:42:32
That's one of those polymers with
alpha 1,4 linkages.

576
00:42:32 --> 00:42:36
That's a sugar storage molecule.
So if you start running, you

577
00:42:36 --> 00:42:39
carbo-load, you try and get as much
sugar into glycogen as you possibly

578
00:42:39 --> 00:42:43
can.  You start running the marathon.
Your body starts taking that

579
00:42:43 --> 00:42:46
glycogen and breaking it down into
sugars.  It runs it through that

580
00:42:46 --> 00:42:50
process.  What happens when you hit
the wall as a human body is most

581
00:42:50 --> 00:42:53
human bodies are designed so that
you run out of sugar.

582
00:42:53 --> 00:42:57
You just cannot carbo-load enough
to do 26 miles.

583
00:42:57 --> 00:43:01
You can get through 20 or something
there.

584
00:43:01 --> 00:43:04
And when you run out of that what
happens then is your body can no

585
00:43:04 --> 00:43:08
longer burn sugar so it switched to
burning fatty acids.

586
00:43:08 --> 00:43:11
And that's less efficient and you
really feel it.

587
00:43:11 --> 00:43:15
If any of you have done long
endurance things or triathlons or

588
00:43:15 --> 00:43:19
anything you've experienced that
change.  The final thing,

589
00:43:19 --> 00:43:22
just to close for the lecture for
today, is one thing you can

590
00:43:22 --> 00:43:26
appreciate.  Yeast is somebody that
can do both of these things,

591
00:43:26 --> 00:43:30
right?  It can either grow
anaeorbically.

592
00:43:30 --> 00:43:37
And it makes C02 plus ethanol.
Or it can grow aerobically.  And

593
00:43:37 --> 00:43:44
this gives it two ATPs per glucose
and this gives it 36 ATPs per

594
00:43:44 --> 00:43:51
glucose.  So if you were a yeast,
you would have to somehow regulate

595
00:43:51 --> 00:43:59
the rate of glycolysis depending on
whether there was oxygen

596
00:43:59 --> 00:44:06
around or not.
And it's very tricky and neat way it

597
00:44:06 --> 00:44:13
happens.  There's an enzyme,
that wouldn't surprise you, that has

598
00:44:13 --> 00:44:19
an active site for one of the key
steps in the pathway where it's

599
00:44:19 --> 00:44:26
going from fructose-1-phosphate,
fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,

600
00:44:26 --> 00:44:32
-diphosphate.
That's one of the intermediate steps

601
00:44:32 --> 00:44:36
in glycolysis.
It's the enzyme that turns out to

602
00:44:36 --> 00:44:41
be rate-limiting.
You can control passage of

603
00:44:41 --> 00:44:45
something through a pathway by just
making one step rate-limiting.

604
00:44:45 --> 00:44:50
So this has a place for the
fructose 6 phosphate plus ATP to

605
00:44:50 --> 00:44:54
bind, and it catalyzes the formation
of the fructose-1,

606
00:44:54 --> 00:44:59
-diphosphate.  But that enzyme has
to work at different rates depending

607
00:44:59 --> 00:45:04
on whether the cell is
aerobic or anaerobic.

608
00:45:04 --> 00:45:11
So what it does is there's a second
binding site over here.

609
00:45:11 --> 00:45:18
And if it binds ATP, this speeds up,
excuse me, slows down the rate

610
00:45:18 --> 00:45:25
that's catalyzed over here.
And that's what you'd expect.

611
00:45:25 --> 00:45:32
If it's got enough ATP it doesn't
need to run glycolysis as fast.

612
00:45:32 --> 00:45:40
And it also binds AMP or ADP, and
that speeds up the rate.

613
00:45:40 --> 00:45:43
So the yeast are able to monitor,
to sort of have a control on how

614
00:45:43 --> 00:45:47
fast sugar flows through this
glycolytic pathway.

615
00:45:47 --> 00:45:51
And what they're really doing is
they're monitoring do I have enough

616
00:45:51 --> 00:45:55
ATP or not?  And so if they're
running with respiration,

617
00:45:55 --> 00:45:59
making lots of stuff, they don't
need to do glycolysis as fast.

618
00:45:59 --> 00:46:03
If they're anaerobic they have to
run it 18 times as fast to get the

619
00:46:03 --> 00:46:08
same amount of energy.
OK?  We'll begin the next lecture

620
00:46:08 --> 00:46:12
with photosynthesis and then we're
going to get into a bunch of

621
00:46:12 --> 00:46:15
molecular biology.  OK?
