7.014 Introductory Biology, Spring 2005 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 13 

Julia just mentioned that a few of you had commented, when we were ta lking about 
the genetic code, that some of you thought the fact that it was degenerate, it had 
some redundancy in it, like multiple codons or threonine, that that was kind of cool, 
and some of you thought it was sort of a waste and would have maybe designed the 
thing d ifferently. That's, you know, part of when you study b iology you don't get to 
design it from first principles. 

You  found out what happened during evolution and what got selected for. And once 
it gets selected for then that gets sort of fixed in nature. If there were four 
nucleotides then you could have one, two and three- letter words. And it's going to be 
a three-letter word to have at least 20 then you've got some degeneracy or 
redundancy, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. 

And, in  fact, if you go into the evolution of the code more deep ly, peop le are 
beginning to suspect it evolved from a simpler one. And there actually are some 
relationships between some of the codons that go back to the similarities, the 
chemical similarities between the amino acids. And it a lso allows some things for 
some cells,  for examp le, if they want proteins to be present at very low levels they 
will use a codon that has just a very low level of the corresponding tRNA. 

And if they want to make a lot of the protein they'll use a tRNA that  it makes in 
abundance. And so it's sort of another way of controlling levels of proteins. There are 
a lot of different subtleties in here. And also in b iology redundancy is not necessarily 
a bad thing. It's just like on a space flight, if something goes wrong and if there's 
some kind of redundant function then you've got some backups, too. 

OK. Well,  in any case, today is a pretty interesting first part of the lecture. I've heard 
a few people express the view that why can't I just teach what's in the textbook and 
get on w ith  it? And I think this part, for those of you who are follow ing, really trying 
to understand what I'm trying to do with this course, I hope this w ill help you to see 
this. Because what I've ta lked about, this thing that Crick ca lled the "centra l dogma" 
which was the d irection of information  flow in b iology which was from DNA to RNA to 
proteins. 

And I'll just remind you, although proteins do many things they are,  for examp le, 
enzymes that are biological cata lysts. And it was pretty well-established, even by the 
time I was an undergrad that this was the way information flow went in biology and 
this was how it worked. And there were various statements in the literature that 
what was true for E. coli was true for an elephant. 

And it is still true today in a broad sense that, as I've tried to emphasize throughout 
the course, when you get down to a cellular molecule level there's an aw ful lot in 
common and things look much more a like than different compared to what we see at 
a more macroscopic scale. However, that doesn't mean that a ll the deta ils are the 
same. And maybe you could begin to get a g limmering of that when I told you that 
although the genetic code is virtua lly universa l. 

That a lmost every organism, w ith only a couple very tiny exceptions, uses exactly 
the same genetic code to have nucleotides correspond to three- letter words in the 
nucleic acid a lphabet correspond to particular amino acids in a protein. But the other 
languages that are written in there such as the sequence to start transcribing a 
gene, making an RNA copy or stop. Those are different between different organisms. 
Yeah? Glycolysis enzymes are amaz ingly similar. 

They are very clearly, they arose once, and they have stayed right through 
evolution. You could, in princip le, sometimes in evolution you get something that 
creates a function and something that starts out, and then like what they call 
convergent evolution you end up w ith two things that came from a d ifferent 
evolutionary origin but have learned to do,  let's say, cata lyze the same biochemical 
reaction or something. 

Glycolysis came once. But if you were to look  inside E. coli or yeast, let's say E. coli 
and look at how those enzymes are regulated, the thing that says this is the start of 
a gene, start making the RNA, it would look tota lly d ifferent than if you looked in a 
mouse because the language, the promoter does not have the same sequence in an 
E. coli and in a human or in a mouse. And I'll tell you more about that today. 

But there were -- I want to just now tell you sort of three things that were sort of 
exceptions to  this genera l way of thinking. Every one of them generated a Nobel 
Prize. And this is a fun lecture for me to give because the ind ividua ls involved in all 
of these things had a very, very close association w ith MIT. And when I told you 
when Crick ca lled this a central dogma he meant a hypothesis, or at least an  idea  for 
which there was not reasonable evidence. 

And he learned  later it was something a true believer cannot doubt. And once this 
gets estab lished it does get in the textbook and it does get in your thinking. And so 
information goes down this way. But there were a few oddities. I mean there were 
some viruses that had RNA inside them. They didn't have DNA. So how where these 
handled? Well, there turned out to be two classes of RNA virus. 

One that was stud ied quite heavily called, it's a plant virus ca lled the tobacco mosa ic 
virus. And it had a coat. And then it had  in it a p iece of RNA. Now, you can see if that 
virus were to  inject RNA in the cell it could encode proteins. But that genetic material 
has to be cop ied. And the RNA was copied -- -- by an RNA dependent RNA 
polymerase. And so it's sort of just  like the RNA polymerase before, except instead of 
using DNA as its temp late it can use RNA. 

So that sort of somehow would be a little loop in here about RNA being ab le to copy 
itself that hadn't been anticipated. And a lthough this is an important virus in the 
plant industry, for plants and agriculture, it's not so important for humans. But 
there's another class of RNA viruses that are very important. And these are ca lled 
retroviruses. And the reason these are so important is that the HIV-1 virus that's 
associated with AIDS is such a  retrovirus. 

It's a virus that has a coat and it has an RNA that's its genetic materia l. And the 
person who worked out how this goes was a person at MIT, Dave Baltimore. He was 
a colleague of mine here for many years. He was the person who founded the White-
head Institute and got that up and going. And he then  finally, to move up one more 
administrative challenge, went to Ca ltech to be president. 

And that's where he is today. And David was working on this problem trying to figure 
out how  these retroviruses work. And  they're important. Not only the HIV-1 virus, 
but there are certa in viruses that are associated with cancer. In genera l, what they 
do is they've p icked up what's called an oncogene which is sort of often a mutated 
version of one of your normal genes. And if that virus gets inside one of your cells 
and brings in this mutated gene it's sort of kind of the same consequence as 
mutating one of your own genes a long that progression of cancer. 

So it can kind of, say, bring in a cell that screws up the control on when cells are 
supposed to rep licate and stop divid ing and so on. So David started to work on 
these, and what he d iscovered was that these viruses encoded, they had information 
encod ing proteins. And one of the proteins encoded in their RNA is an enzyme he 
characterized which is given the name "reverse transcriptase". 

And what this can do is take an RNA template and make the corresponding 
complimentary DNA strand in this way. So that if we took the -- We'll just take this 
RNA out of the virus. What this virus encodes then is an enzyme that's ab le to take 
this RNA and make the correspond ing DNA copy. So there's the origina l RNA that 
was in the virus. There is the RNA that  it started out. And so what  is happening, if 
you will in that case, is the information is flowing in the other direction. 

That was a marvelous d iscovery. And it was discovered by someone who wasn't 
willing just to take what was in the textbooks but was trying to  figure out what could 
possibly be going on here. Now, the way these viruses work then, once they've done 
this it's not so bad because they've got their information now  in the form of DNA. So 
this strand of DNA can be made into a double-stranded DNA by just using the kinds 
of enzymes that we've a lready talked about. 

A DNA dependent DNA polymerase will be ab le to copy the other thing. And now 
you've got a DNA copy of the information that used to be in the virus. But what 
happens to that is that you have a piece of the host DNA. And this viral DNA then 
inserts into it, so you end up w ith this situation where you have DNA from the host, 
and this is the virus DNA. So  this is the DNA that encodes the information needed for 
the virus. 

And if this was our DNA then it would be inserted that way. And there are just a 
handful of health messages I've tried to drive home in this thing. I mentioned 
smoking the other day. If you smoke -- If you stop smoking you basica lly, well,  let 
me try another way. The risk of smoking is about equa l to the sum of everything else 
you can possibly do in your life that w ill affect your chances of getting cancer, 
leaving aside what you inherited from mom and dad. 

The one single thing to not do  if you want to avoid cancer, or to help loved ones who 
smoke avoid cancer, is just don't smoke, or if you do smoke, stop. You freeze the 
risk of whatever increased risk you've got, and then just live with that, but it doesn't 
keep getting worse w ith time. The other one  is practice safe sex, and this is why. 

HIV-1 is a  retrovirus. If you get infected w ith it,  it makes a DNA copy of the RNA, it 
makes the other strand of the DNA, and it sticks itself in. So what you've got is your 
DNA here, your DNA there. And HIV-1 is a permanent traveling companion for the 
rest of your life. There's no way of getting that out of there right now. All the 
systems for dea ling w ith AIDS are just managing the infection. 

So when someone  is HIV-1 positive, they've got those viral genes now permanently 
integrated into their DNA. So it's extremely  important that you be aware of that, or if 
you know people who don't appreciate this because they haven't got so much of a 
biology background that you help them understand that. OK. So I just wanted to 
show you, I found one other picture last night. And this is you see a ll these old 
scientists, right? Of course, David d idn't  look like this when he was doing his work. 

In fact, I think he's fairly cleaned up here. I found this one in the Cold Spring Harbor 
archives  last night. I've seen pictures of him looking considerab ly more shaggy and 
perhaps d isreputable and stuff. But anyway, when David was making all these 
discoveries he was still quite a young man. I believe he got his Nobel Prize when he 
was still in his thirties. And so many of these discoveries are made by peop le that 
are not all that much older than you. 

But, aga in, it's trying to understand why we know what we know and then trying to 
fit other things into it. Now, the next thing I want to tell you about that has some of 
this same character, I've sort of told you that you have a p iece of DNA. Let's say 
there's a gene here and this is the coding region, and then we make a mRNA copy, 
and then we use the genetic code and we make the protein. And so if we sequence 
the DNA and find the beginning of this protein we can read a long using that genetic 
code and away it should go. 

And that was beautifully worked out, understood, just like I sort of finished up telling 
you the other day. So Phil Sharp who got a Nobel Prize for this work and is a 
colleague in the Biology Department. He's  in the Cancer Center just across the street 
from the build ing I'm in. That was the cancer center that Sa lvador Luria, who Jim 
Watson trained w ith, had founded. And Phil was studying this process. It was before 
we could sequence DNA. 

It was in the mid '70s. And he was working with the tools we had then trying to map 
the relationship of an RNA to a gene that was on a virus. It was a DNA virus, not an 
RNA virus, so don't get yourself mixed up with that. But what he had was basica lly a 
fragment of DNA that he knew encoded the gene. So he knew somewhere on this 
piece of DNA there was a gene somewhere in here, and he had isolated the mRNA. 

And one way you could map, physica lly see the relationship of an RNA and a DNA 
would be to take, let's just take away one of these strands. So we have the 
complimentary strand of the DNA to the RNA. And if we mix them together and let 
them slow ly cool down they will form hydrogen bonds. They'll form a DNA-RNA 
hybrid just the same way two strands of DNA come on. And so if the gene was a 
little shorter than the p iece of DNA then you might have expected to see something 
that looked like this. 

And the way you'd see this, if you looked in an electron microscope -- -- perhaps it 
would look sort of like this. You cannot actua lly see the two strands, but you'd see a 
thick part. That would be the RNA dup lex. So this would be just DNA. And the thick 
part is RNA base paired with a single strand of DNA. You got it? That's what 
textbooks said you should have seen. And so this is more. 

This is data from Phil's paper describing this. And let me focus on this one in 
particular. That's what he actually saw. You guys got any idea what's going on? Why 
don't you take a minute, find somebody who 's near you and see if you can come up 

with any ideas. Here's the hybrid. Forget about this  little bit at the 3 prime end. 
That's not a worry. Here  is the thing. And this, I think, is a p iece of single stranded 
DNA sticking out the end. 

But it looks a b it more comp licated. Any ideas? Most peop le put this data  in their 
drawers. Phil didn't. Phil and his colleagues d idn't. What they rea lized was, I'm going 
to try and  redraw this just very slightly to help you see what's going on. What they 
were seeing was something that looked  rather like what they were expecting. They 
were seeing a reg ion of hybrid DNA and they were seeing a reg ion of single-stranded 
DNA like this, but what it looked like was there were little loops of sing le-stranded 
DNA sticking out. 

And what Phil had discovered was a phenomenon we now know as RNA sp licing. And 
here's what goes on. In bacteria, w ith very few exceptions, you can look at the DNA, 
you can find the open reading  frame and you can just read off the sequence of the 
protein. You find the ATG, AUG, methionine codon, and then it keeps going no stops, 
and fina lly you come to a stop codon and you see there is the protein. 

So the coding information is essentia lly continuous in a lmost a ll bacterial genes. And 
there's a few, some genes like that in eukaryotes, but many eukaryotic genes are 
constructed, it's almost as  if you took the gene you'd  find in a bacterium and then 
you'd cut it in a bunch of places and stuck extra DNA in between a ll of the pieces. So 
you'd get something like this where there's, in the DNA there'd be coding 
information. 

And then non-coding information and another b lock of coding information. And then 
a block of non-coding and say another one of coding information. So  this is a double-
stranded DNA. And what happens then when the cell makes RNA  is the whole thing 
gets copied into what's known now as a pre-messenger RNA. And so there's a bit of 
coding stuff here, there's a bit of coding stuff here, and there's some more cod ing 
stuff there. 

But what the cell has is sort of like your unedited footage from your family summer 
vacation when you were running the video camera. And maybe you don't want to 
show everybody ever second of video that you took during the thing. So what you 
do, you get in there and you edit it. In the old days you used to have to take the film 
and splice it. 

And now you can all do it with iMovie or something like that. But what you do is take 
the p ieces of information you want, and this is what the cell is doing. It takes this 
part of the RNA. And this part of the RNA, and joins it together, and then this part. 
And when it's done it has the mRNA that now looks like the kind of mRNA that you 
would find in a bacterium where you can find the start codon. And then you could 
read in three-letter words all the way through to the end of the protein. 

So, in essence, what Phil found was that in many organisms at least there's another 
step in here where we get RNA sp licing. And only after that you get down to 
proteins. What was quite remarkable about this result and why I'm kind of 
hammering on it a little b it is this is the data that's out of Phil's paper. You can  look 
it up on the Internet. Type in Phil Sharp 1977 and you'll find this original paper w ith 
that figure in it. 

The moment Phil realized what it was and talked about it at a meeting, a whole lot of 
people suddenly sort of a lmost simultaneously d iscovered RNA splicing because they 
opened their drawers and there were a ll these uninterpretab le electron micrographs 
they had. And they were in very short order able to save it in the system. The same 
thing was going on, but  it was just confusing, it didn't fit, and to some extent most 
people's minds were set by this paradigm, this centra l dogma as something that a 
true believer cannot doubt. 

And you had to have a  flexible enough mind to be ab le to see that. And so this is an 
important piece of biology that hadn't been anticipated. And it can be quite 
remarkable. I'm just going to give you a coup le of extreme examples. Well, not even 
extreme examp les. But just show you how much non-coding information there can 
be. Factor 8 is a protein that plays a part in blood clotting. 

And the gene is 200 kilobase pa irs. And the pre-mRNA is just a direct copy, so it's 
200 kilobases. It's just a single strand so it's not a base pa ir. And the actually spliced 
mRNA when it's done is 10 kilobases. So  that means that only 5% of the gene is 
coding information and 95% of that information gets thrown away when the RNA 
gets sp liced. And even a more extreme examp le is a protein called dystrophin. 

This is what's affected in a human genetic d isease known as Duchenne Muscular 
Dystrophy. In this case, the gene is two mega- base pa irs. So of course then the 
pre-mRNA is also  two megabases but the pre-RNA is 16 kilobases. So in this case 
less than 1% of the gene has cod ing information for making a protein. There are a 
lot of interesting reasons as to why it would be like this. 

One this, things can evolve more rapid ly sometimes because you have parts of 
proteins that are sort of like modules and evolution can probab ly connect them. In 
fact, it a lso provides ways of regulating because we now know there are alternative 
ways of sp licing RNA. So you can take one RNA and then sp lice it in d ifferent ways in 
different cells and end up generating different proteins that were all encoded by one 
particular gene. 

And so  it gives cells different kinds of regulatory strategies they can use. Now, the 
third sort of thing that came out that falls in this same kind of thing of people having 
their minds open and not fixed by the current understand ing or bounded by the 
current understanding is the discovery that RNA can act as an enzyme. And I've 
already talked to you about that and  I've told it was ribozyme, but it was discovered 
by Tom Cech. 

Tom  is currently president of the Howard Hughes Med ica l Institute, but he did his 
post-doctoral work at MIT w ith Mary Lou Pardue. I'd been a post-doc at Berkeley 
when he was just finishing his graduate work, and I met him out there. And then he 
came to MIT to do his post-doc. And a year later I got a job so I'd become friends 
there and became friends when we started here. So I had a pretty close link to this 
particular story. 

Here's a picture of Tom together w ith Phil. That's actually my wife right there who 
was in this p icture. But Tom actua lly looks much more like that. He's very colorful, 
very fun, a very interesting person. But anyway, when Tom left MIT to take a faculty 
position at Bolder he was interested in trying to understand the biochemistry of RNA 
splicing. And so he went -- He d id what a good scientist will do. 

They'll try and find an experimenta l system where the question they want to address 
is simp le enough you can actua lly get an answer. There's a kind of way of doing 
science where you pick a system that's too complicated and you never actually get 
an answer. It sounds very important because you're working on something that's 
important but you cannot, you don't have the tools you need to get to  the answer. 

So Tom wanted to work on the b iochemistry of RNA splicing because that had just 
been discovered. And so he went to a small little tiny organism called tetrahymena. 
And the reason he  looked at that was because it had a ribosoma l RNA, so it was an 
RNA that was made in great abundance within the organism. And it only had one of 
these non-coding  regions. I'll tell you the words for these coding and non-cod ing. 

To me they're non- intuitive, but I guess you should know them. The coding region is 
called, the part that codes is called an exon and  the non-cod ing part is called an 
intron. So, anyway, Tom worked on this organism because the pre-mRNA was 
basically this. Or the pre-mRNA before the sp licing looked like this. This was going to 
give this  like that. He could get large quantities of this RNA, so he was a ll set to 
make extracts of the cells of this organism and then start cooking up this RNA 
substrate with all sorts of cell extracts. 

And then his p lan was to purify the enzymes that did the RNA sp licing. And so I first 
heard about this, Tom was working on this when he was here. And he went off to, I 
guess it was Denmark to learn how to grow this organism. Then they were back and 
he was off at Bolder. And we used to play squash all the time. And whenever I got 
out to Bolder we'd try and get in a squash game. So I was out there at a meeting 
and we were sitting around in the locker room. 

And I sa id so how's the sp licing b iochemistry project going? Tom says, well, it's 
going OK, I guess. There's only one  little problem, he says. The controls are sp licing. 
Now, what he meant was if you were trying to add cell extract and get this thing to 
go what you would start out with is the RNA  in a tube basically. And that would be 
your control. And then you'd start adding stuff to it and start looking for splicing. 

And what Tom was finding was that if you just took this RNA and let it sit in a test 
tube that the splicing happened without him putting anything in. And here he was 
already to find all the enzymes, the proteins that did it. And Tom d id an absolutely 
gorgeous piece of science to prove that what was happening was the RNA was 
cata lyz ing its own splicing. And he had to work very, very hard to prove that it 
wasn't a contaminating protein. 

Remember we had this sort of d iscussion? We were ta lking about is DNA the genetic 
material and how would we know that it wasn't just a little tiny bit of something else 
in our DNA perhaps that was doing it. Tom had to go through pretty much a similar 
exercise, but this was one of these key insights that lead to the proof that RNA could 
function as a cata lyst, what we now know as a  ribozyme. 

And I've shown you now we now sort of accept that the actua l ribosome itself is a 
ribozyme and that the formation of the peptide bond, the thing that's the heart of a ll 
proteins is made by a  ribozyme, not cata lyzed by ribosomes and not by a protein. 
OK. So the next topic that I want to try on which sort of we've already set up from 
this is that if the information is a ll in DNA to beg in with then if you make an RNA 
copy you're only taking a segment of that information at a time. 

And that g ives the cells a lot of possibilities for regulating how they respond to the 
environment or just controlling what genes are expressed. And there are basica lly 
two kinds of strategies that are involved in these regulatory decisions. They can 
either be -- Can either be reversible changes. For examp le, a bacterium and a food 
source. If you're a bacterium and you've got enzymes that let you eat a hundred 
different kinds of food and you're in an environment where there's only one of them 
there, you're rea lly wasting energy if you make the proteins to make the other 99. 

So you might guess that somehow evolution has selected  for systems that have 
learned how to turn on and off the things they need to eat certa in food sources 
depending on whether the food source is availab le. We only carry umbrellas when it 
rains. If you had to carry an umbrella and a snowsuit and a surfboard, everything all 
the time, it would slow you down in evolution. So the other type, which we've ta lked 
about as well when we talked about starting as a sing le cell and going to the 10^14 
cells that make us up,  then many of those changes, as those cells go along and 
progressively more specia lized need to be irreversible. 

And this is particularly important in development. We don't want a cell in our retina 
suddenly deciding it should be part of a heart and start to make a heart in the middle 
of your eye or something like that. So things in development tend to be once you're 
off you're off or once you're on you're on or something. And just to g ive you another 
little look at that picture I've shown you before of the nematode. 

And at the time, the first time I showed you this, I was just trying to emphasize that 
we could take the gene encoding green fluorescent protein and put it in anything and 
it would go green. In this case, Barbara Meyer who is at Berkeley now but used to be 
my office-mate at MIT for many years, what she's done is she's taken that green 
fluorescent protein, the gene for that, and she's put it under the control of a 
regulatory system, a gene that is made to be expressed in the esophagus of the 
worm. 

And so even though that gene is present in all the cells of that organism, it's under 
the control of a system that usua lly permits the genes to be made that are needed 
for making esophagus but not in other parts of the body. So you probably didn't p ick 
that part up now but sort of take another look at that same thing and see something 
different. 

So how do we learn about gene regulation? The key work, like so many of these 
things, started kind of inausp iciously,  if you will. There were two French scientists, 
Jacques Monod, who is a biochemist, Francois Jacob who was a geneticist. And they 
were working on the metabolism of lactose by E. coli. Lactose is galactose, beta 1,4 
glucose. And you don't have to know exactly the structure. 

You can just remember there were a lot of different hydroxyls, and that was one 
particular linkage. And there's an enzyme that cleaves this into ga lactose and 
glucose. And this can go right into g lycolysis and make energy for the organism. And 
the ga lactose undergoes a couple of d ifferent transformations, and it can get in there 
as well. But in order to get at the energy that's in those carbohydrates, this linkage 
has to be broken. 

And it was broken by an enzyme called beta-galactosidase. That's a protein that's 
able to cata lyze the cleavage of those two sugars. That's what Jacques Monod and 
Francois Jacob were studying. They were helped out in this exercise. I guess part of 

the reason they got going on this was people had noticed for many years that if you 
grew E. coli in g lucose there was no beta-gal. 

I'm going to abbreviate this as beta-gal just so I won't have to keep writing the 
same thing. But if they grew E. coli in lactose beta-gal was present. And they had to 
be ab le to assay for this enzyme. And they used -- There were standard types of 
biochemica l assays you could use. But some chemists that helped design a very 
cleaver kind of substrate that helped them,  that could be used in these kinds of 
stud ies, and I'll show you one of them. 

What this enzyme really looks at is it looks at, let's see, ga lactose. What it sees  is 
sort of the galactose side of this linkage, and then it reaches in and catalyzes the 
cleavage of what's joined to it. And it turns out not to be specific for whether g lucose 
is on the other side. It can accept substrates that have other things as well. So some 
chemists made some variants like this. 

This is a compound that's commonly known as X-gal. If you ta lk about it in the lab 
it's got a longer chemica l name. But what happens if beta-galactosidase is there, it's 
able to cleave this substrate so you get ga lactose, which is colorless. But if you get 
just X, this is colored, but up here this original material  is also colorless. So this is 
very convenient because if you use a substrate such as this you could put the cells 
on a plate w ith this indicator. 

And if they are colored, and the color is blue, you'd know they were making beta-
galactosidase. And if you don't see a color, you know they're not. There are a variety 
of ways of assaying for this enzyme. With that I'm just trying to g ive you a little bit 
of flavor of one of the different ways that they could assay for it. Now, one of the 
issues was it looked as though E. coli didn't have any beta-ga lactosidase activity if 
lactose was absent when growing in glucose. 

And they made it if lactose was present. Well, that would be kind of what you would 
expect evolution would have figured out how to do, only make the enzyme for 
metabolizing lactose if the lactose is present, but they had to figure out what the 
molecular basis of this was. And one of the possibilities was that the protein was 
made that it was all sort of unfolded, and when the substrate came in then it folded 
all around it and then it could cleave it. 

Or another possibility, which would be the kind we're talking about now, is the 
protein is not made until the lactose  is present, and then it makes it new. So they 
had to figure out, between these two, which of these two was true. When you see 
the lactose present, is it just beta-galactosidase  is already made but it's inactive, or 
is it being made de novo when you add the  lactose? So what they did was they grew 
cells in g lucose plus radioactive C14- leucine for a long time. 

So a ll the proteins -- -- were rad ioactive. And once they got, that's going for a long 
time. So every protein being made is rad ioactive. Then they add excess unlabeled 
leucine. So  this means that from now on any new proteins that are made w ill not be 
radioactive because you're just going to swamp out any rad ioactive stuff w ith this. 
And they added glucose, excuse me, now they added lactose to the cells. 

And then they isolated the beta-gal enzyme. It was actually pretty easy to do. It's a 
huge enzyme and it's a tetramer. So very large. Even in those days  it was fairly easy 
to isolate this enzyme. And then they looked to see is it radioactive? If it's 

radioactive it was there all along and it's refolded to become the active enzyme. Or if 
it had been only after lactose then it would be made de novo  in response to it. 

And what they found was that it was non-rad ioactive. Which imp lied that it was 
made after you added the lactose. So they knew then that they were studying a 
system in which a protein was only made after the cells had experienced a particular 
growth substrate. And so a lot of work went into figuring out how this system 
worked. Let's see. We're a little short on time. So I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll tell you, 
I'll just put out quickly the mechanics of what they saw, and we'll start in on the 
regulation on how this works. 

And some of you may be ab le to figure it out. What we now know is that the gene 
that encodes beta-ga lactosidase is in a stretch of DNA that's pretty  interesting. It's 
got three genes. It's the gene lacZ. This is the gene for beta-ga lactosidase. And 
another gene called lacY and lacA. There's a promoter. That's a start signal for 
transcription. Remember that? So there's a sequence here that says start 
transcription. 

Down here is a terminator. Another word written in the nucleic acid alphabet that 
means stop making mRNA. And there is one long mRNA, as you can see, that has 
the peculiarity of encoding three different genes. So if you have more than one gene 
in a single message then that's called an operon. You've got one mRNA. But, in any 
case, so whenever beta-ga lactosidase was being made then RNA has to start being 
made here, goes to there. 

And we won't worry about the functions of these other two genes. But, as you might 
guess from the way evolution has selected for it, they have related activities to what 
beta-ga lactosidase does. And for bacteria it's a very efficient way to control the 
expression of a bunch of genes at once. Then there was another gene up here known 
as lacI that had a promoter and a terminator, and it made an mRNA as well. 

And that mRNA encoded a protein that's known as the lac repressor. And what that 
lac repressor does, it's a protein that has the ab ility to recognize a very, very specific 
DNA sequence and bind there. And I'm just going to kind of blow up this part of the 
thing. So what we have here is the, this is the promoter here. And it happens that 
the b inding sequence -- -- for lac repressor overlaps with the promoter. 

Weird, right? Maybe not. So I'll tell you, well, you can think about this over the 
weekend, if you haven't run into this system before. So  this gene gets made all the 
time. So this protein gets made a ll the time. What does that protein do if it's just like 
this? Its job in life is to look for this sequence and bind to it. If  it binds to it, it covers 
up the promoter. And the beta-galactosidase gene is not expressed because the cell 
cannot make mRNA. 

So this may seem a little obscure, but there's something very important here. Now 
the conditiona lity on whether this gene is expressed or not is controlled by a protein, 
right? It's controlled by this lac repressor. If it's on there the gene won't be made. 
And if it's off the gene now you can make it. There's a promoter and the RNA 
polymerase will see it. 

And so you've learned something about proteins. They can bind various things. And 
so what lac repressor has,  it's got a little binding site that lactose is ab le to bind to 
and change the confirmation of the lac repressor. So why don't you take those pieces 

of information and see if you can  figure out how the circuitry goes. Yeah? Did I do 
something wrong? Sorry. 

Oh, sorry. Excuse me. Yes, Z-Y-A. Excuse me. OK? We'll walk through that on 
Monday, but focus on the fact that if the repressor is there and lactose isn't, it binds 
to this sequence. The repressor is made all the time, but this repressor is something 
that can tell you whether lactose is there or not. So you can put the circuit together, 
OK?
