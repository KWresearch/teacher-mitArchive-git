Transcript â€“ Lecture 15 

So in this last lecture, what I'd like to do is I'd like to now begin to talk about 
genetics. And when we talked early on in the semester I was showing you this way 
that you can study b iological function. Biochemists, for the most part, study how 
proteins work. And what genetics does, steadying function, it's enable one to 
discover genes. And the molecular b iology that we're going to be ta lking about in the 
back part of the course has been really tota lly amazing because it's a llowed one to 
go back and  forth between genes and proteins, something that used to be very, very 
hard until recombinant DNA came into the p icture. 

Now, up until now I've sort of mentioned genetics as we went a long. But we haven't 
really ta lked about it as a discip line and the kind of power that this experimental 
approach has. Thank you. I could have done this w ithout notes but it's easier to have 
them. I just have my little help here. So I know some of you have written in your 
comments I d idn't think there was going to be so much chemistry. 

Well, we had a little b it of a bout with chemistry. And then some of you found that 
we were going away from bonds and thinking about 3-d imensionality, and that was 
another kind of thinking. And then sort of trying to work through the genetic code is 
almost another. And I think you'll find here, as we start to go through genetics that 
you have to stretch your bra in in another direction. 

And part of one of the rea lly interesting things about biology today is you cannot just 
sort of think about it in one kind of very comfortable way of thinking and rea lly take 
advantage of everything that's out there. You need to be able to talk in multiple 
languages and multip le d isciplines. And so today I want to just kind of briefly g ive 
you an introductory sense of how genetics,  that I hope w ill g ive you, let you see the 
power of it by very, very simple techniques. 

And remember what you're doing here is you're studying variants of the living 
organism. So if you see something that's wrong with it you know it's important, but 
you know the rest of the job is to figure out what's wrong. And I've sort of given you 
and used some examp les. When we talked about the streptococcus with the smooth 
colonies, I ta lked about how people had noticed  rough colonies. 

Well, those sorts of things had been a change in the DNA and they weren't making 
these polysaccharide capsules anymore. Or when I talked to you about the mutant 
bacteria that had lost mismatch repair, they had a high mutation frequency 
compared to a wild type. So up until now I've sort of mentioned them, but we 
haven't rea lly talked about how one goes about studying things in a systematic 
genetic way. 

So let me beg in with just a  few definitions. I rea lize this is a little dry but we need to 
make sure that we're a ll on the same page in terms of the language. So a mutant is 
a variant of a norma l organism. It has a change  in its DNA and the kinds of mutants 
can vary all over the map. For examp le, if we had an E. coli that was, we might ca ll 

it pen-resistant, that could mean it was resistant to penicillin and would grow in the 
presence of the antibiotics. 

Whereas, ordinary ones would die. Or if we had what we call a his-minus mutant 
broken in the b iosynthesis of histidine won't grow -- -- unless you add histidine to 
the medium. Those are a coup le of simple examples. When we start right after 
lecturing, when I come back, I'm going to beg in with Mendel, which is the more 
classic and usual way of teaching genetics. And he used various tra its of peas. 

Yellow and green seeds and wrinkled and round. And you can see what he was 
working w ith there. Another favorite organism for genetic study has been the fruit fly 
or drosophila. You can even see that they have red eyes. If you take a close look 
next time if one lands on your sandwich or your drink or something in the summer. 
But you can see, for examp le, peop le were ab le to get white mutants that have white 
eyes. 

There's something broken in making the p igment that's going to make it red. Here's 
an even weirder one. This is a single mutation in drosophila. It affects a 
developmental process instead of something else. And what happens is this is a 
drosophila head. And norma lly there are antennae that grow out of the top of the 
head. And you can see what's happened in this mutant is there's a pair of legs 
grow ing out of the top of the head. 

It's just a sing le gene that's been changed, but it's a gene that plays a role  in the 
developmental program, the patterning that makes certain cells become specia lized 
to become certain other things. So it's just to g ive you an  idea. And I showed you 
these. We've talked about the xeroderma p igmentosum, one change. A person w ith 
this has got a gene that's broken  in dea ling w ith damage from UV. 

Or I've given you an example of what they call Werner syndrome where a change in 
a sing le gene, it's actually a kind of gene whose proteins are involved in unw inding 
DNA, of a ll things, can g ive you this premature aging phenotype where the woman 
looks normal at 16 but older at the age of 48. So all of these are, if you will, mutants 
that are a variant of a w ild type. And then this is something peop le often get 
confused between these two terms. 

The mutation is the actual change in the DNA. Now, one other thing that's sort of 
implicit in this definition is that we know what a normal organism is. Well, if you look 
around this room, what's a normal human? Well, I'm OK but I don't know about the 
rest of you. I'm sure we all feel that way, but we have a lot of variation in it. So, to 
some extent, it's an operational definition. 

And most often it's applied, if you're studying something like drosophila or E. coli, 
someone has been propagating a particular bacterial  isolate in the lab for a long 
time. And you ca ll that one the wild type, even though,  in fact, in the case of an E. 
coli, it may have changed a bit so  it likes to grow in the conditions that it finds  in the 
lab. But this sort of norma l is an operationa l definition. 

Now, another important term that geneticists use a ll the time  is the phenotype. The 
word phenotype. And that's the ensemble -- -- of observable characteristics -- -- of 
an organism. For example, in these resistance to penicillin would be an examp le of a 
phenotype. A mutant that had acquired the resistance would have the phenotype of 
being resistant. Sometimes these phenotypes can be a  little subtle. 

A cond itiona l phenotype would be a phenotype that you could observe under one 
characteristic and not in another. For example, a temperature sensitive phenotype --
Whatever it might be. For example, it could be wild type at  let's say 30 degrees but 
mutant at 37 degrees centigrade. That may sound like a sort of fiddly little thing. 
Why am I telling you about a cond itiona l phenotype right off? Well, suppose you 
wanted to study a DNA polymerase. 

be it E. coli or me, and it's the one that replicates your DNA? If we get a mutant that 
just kills, knocks out the activity of the gene we have no living organism to study, we 
cannot do any genetics. But you can work around that. You can do genetics w ith 
essentia l functions if you get a mutant where you see the mutant phenotypes,  let's 
say, at the high temperature but not at a low temperature. 

And what that kind of thing usua lly comes from  is a change in the protein where the 
protein has one amino acid changed to something else and it folds up, and at the 
lower temperature it's able to  fold up and do its thing. But it's not quite as stable as 
the original protein. And if you ra ise the temperature it unfolds a bit, and once it 
unfolds it doesn't work or it gets degraded or something like that. 

OK. So that's phenotype. The genotype then refers to the state of the organism 's 
genetic materia l w ith respect to whether its wild type d iffers from it. So let me just 
put that down. So this refers to the state -- -- of the organism's genetic material -- -
- with respect to whether it's w ild type or it's mutant. There's a key distinction, even 
though they sort of sound the same. 

This is what you can see if you look at it but this is what's actua lly changed. The 
genotype is what's actually changed in the DNA. And  there's a caution. If it's 
something like a bacterium it's fine because  it's only got one copy of every gene. If I 
knock out a gene for making histidine it cannot make histidine. The genotype and 
the phenotype are the same. But if you have a d iploid organism, which is the kind of 
organism that we are and peas are and fruit flies are, there are two cop ies of most 
genes, one from mom and one from dad. 

And the only exceptions are the ones involved w ith the sex chromosomes. Then you 
can get to something else, a more comp licated situation. Because let's say we have a 
usua l thing where both copies of the gene are p lus, then the phenotype is wild type, 
but if we were to break one of those copies by a mutation this one is still wild type. 
The phenotype is still its wild type. 

You cannot tell from looking at it that this one is different than that one. And one of 
the really brilliant insights that Mendel had when he was looking at peas was he 
would take things that were wrinkled and round and crossed them and he'd see 
mixtures of things. And he realized some of those things in there weren't the same 
as either the parents but they resembled one of the parents. 

And I'll take you through that in the next thing. So it's just a caution at the moment 
that you have to be careful that phenotype and genotype are not always the same. 
And then I've used the word gene. That's the d iscrete unit -- -- of genetic 
information. We ta lked the other day about the lacZ gene that encodes beta-
galactosidase. OK. So I think what I'd like to do, if I tell you, for example, we made 
a lot of mutants of E. 

coli that were broken by the biosynthesis of histidine and gave them to you, if you 
were a good biochemist you might be able to work out how they differed by studying 
them biochemically. And let me just sort of give you a sense of how that would work 
so you can see histidine or any of these amino acids. They're sort of comp licated and 
they have to be built up by a sequence of biochemica l steps with one enzyme 
cata lyz ing each step in the pathway. 

And when people started out trying to study that kind of thing they didn't know how 
it was made. All they knew was what the end product was. And furthermore it was 
more of a b iosynthetic challenge even then trying to work out the steps of g lycolysis 
because actually quite a  reasonable proportion of the protein in any cell is devoted 
towards making energy. So, relatively speaking, there's a  fair amount of the protein. 

Each of those proteins that are enzymes that we learned about, for example, in 
glycolysis in a cell, if you crack a cell open they're made in larger quantities. 
However, all the b iosynthetic enzymes, the things for making amino acids,  for 
making purines, pyrimidines, nucleotides or vitamins, which are only needed tiny 
amounts, there are only little tiny bits of those enzymes. So trying to work out the 
biosynthetic pathways for how those things were made was much more difficult. 

And it was helped by genetics in the follow ing way. I'm not going to go into any 
great detail, but if you imagine that there's a pathway for making histid ine. We don't 
know what it  is. But we know that the end product  is histid ine. We could get 
mutants. His-minus mutants, which I've said up  there, have the property of growing 
only if you add histidine. So if we had just a minimal glucose plate, just some salts 
with glucose and we were to streak a wild type bacterium on it, it would grow just 
fine. 

But if we had a his-minus mutant on a minima l glucose plate and we streaked it out, 
it couldn't grow because it couldn't make histid ine. If it couldn't make histidine it 
couldn't make proteins. But if we take the same plate, minimal glucose plus some 
histid ine, now  this same mutant w ill grow  fine. And that's how we could tell that  it 
was specifically broken in making histidine. 

So if you were to go into an undergrad lab, and I won't talk for the moment on how 
you would isolate those his-minus bacteria,  it's not hard, you can do it in an 
undergrad lab, you can make a whole lot of mutants that were broken in making 
histid ine. So one of the sort of things b iochemists could do was they didn't know 
what the intermediates were, but let's just say there's intermed iate-1, intermed iate-
2, intermed iate-3, intermed iate-4 and  intermed iate-5. 

And finally  it goes to histidine. Well, if we break the gene that makes that, what will 
happen  in that pathway is the cell will make this intermediate, this intermediate, and 
then this one w ill kind of build up. And, furthermore, if I'm able to  figure out what 
intermed iate-4 is, if I add intermed iate-4 to this mutant it will grow because the 
defect was earlier in the pathway. 

And if I added intermediate-1 it won't grow. And so by sort of using very fine 
features of the phenotype, I mean getting in there, breaking it open and discovering 
what intermediate was up, or I could add an intermediate back and forth, sort of 
playing with the phenotype you can learn a lot about the mutants that you've 
isolated and so on. But genetics as -- And we'll sort of go into this just a  little bit 
more. 

But genetics as a science  is able to  figure out whether mutations are in the same 
genes and work out their order w ithout having to do any of these sort of specialized 
know ledge of a phenotype. It's a very genera l, very powerful way of doing business. 
And I want to show you that. I want to use a system where we can see this very 
clearly. And  I want to introduce you to a bacterial virus. 

The idea of a bacterial virus, which are ca lled bacteriophage, but it's just a bacteria l 
virus. And what's a bacteriophage? Well, it's got a protein coat of some kind. They 
don't all look the same, but just some of them look like this. So this is protein and 
this is DNA. That's it genetic material. And it's basically a syringe. It's got a coat and 
it's got stuff that will let it find a bacterial host. And it's able to squirt its DNA  from 
the bacterium into the host. 

So if we take, for example, an E. coli cell and this phage, which I'm drawing not to 
sca le, it would be sma ller than this relative to the bacterium. If  it were to  infect, it 
would inject its DNA  into the E. coli cell. And what it's sort of done is it's put a bunch 
of new genetic information into a cell that's a ll capable of making RNA and proteins. 

And so  it kind of reprograms the cell in the way I'm going to show you in a minute. 
So when this new DNA comes in, this is the E. coli DNA. And the virus kind of takes 
over the cell. And what it does is it makes  it into a machine or a factor for making 
baby virus, if you will. So first it makes phage DNA. And then it also makes the 
proteins that self-assemble to give [ its code?]. 

So it's kind of reprogrammed the cell. And some of the viruses that infect our cells 
are essentially doing the same thing. They stick their genetic material into our cells 
and it takes over. So unlike the retrovirus that we were ta lking about, this thing is 
not inserting its DNA into the genome of the host. It's just using the cell as a  factory 
for making more of its own. So then these assemble so that the host has now got 
phage inside  it like this. 

And the cells then lyse, which means that they burst open. The phage, once it's done 
all of this, makes a specia l enzyme that degrades the bacterial cell wall. And  it 
makes the cell pop open. And it releases these free phage. And if you start w ith one 
of them you might get, for example, 150 coming out of the cell when it bursts. And 
then each one of these is ab le to grab hold of another uninfected E. coli and start the 
cycle again. 

And the cycle takes usua lly something like 20 to 30 minutes for a bacteriophage. So 
it's pretty quick. One phage adbsorbing to a bacterium,  injecting its DNA can make 
that 150 copies of  itself in about 20 minutes, and then each of those can infect. So 
how would you detect something like this? Well, the trick that's done is pretty 
simple. You take something like ten to the eighth bacteria. 

Let's say you have some bacteria in a test tube and then maybe let's say ten to the 
two phage, and then you spread it on just a Petri plate that the bacteria can grow 
on. So there are many, many bacteria. So they're just going to sort of grow up and 
form kind of a lawn that will cover the whole p late. And if you were to hold it up to 
the light you'd see it's sort of opaque now because the bacteria have grown up. 

But anywhere there was a phage to start out w ith, a sing le phage it would infect its 
orig ina l cell, the cell would burst open, it would  release 150 phage, they'd  infect the 

nearest 150 bacteria, they'd break open. And so what happens is the bacteria trying 
to grow and cover the p late, the phage are grow ing and eating all the bacteria. 

Basica lly at least using up a ll the bacteria in that area. So what you get from this are 
little holes in the "lawn", and they're called a plaque. That's the technical term. Here. 
And so  it's actually very easy to see how many phage you have because you just put 
them out on a p late. And I rea lize this might sound slightly fanciful. There is a 
textbook p icture of a bacteriophage with the DNAs all packaged up in the head. 

It's got a sheath. It's got little things that w ill  let it recognize a particular host. And it 
really does look like a syringe. And  it's got stuff that squirts, basically the mechanics 
to squirt the DNA in. There's an electron micrograph. So that's a  rea l one. This is not 
just a  textbook cartoon. It's a pretty accurate depiction. This was a little thing. This 
is cycling, so don't get it mixed up. This only happens once. 

But this is basica lly depicting the idea  that the DNA starts out in the phage and then 
it gets injected into the cell. And once it's in the cell the empty coat, it doesn't have 
anything else to do in this story, but the DNA takes over. And then you get, after a 
little while, when you've made these progeny phage the cell breaks open. And if you 
assay them, this is just a p icture one of my post-docs made for me. 

I think you can see here's a lawn. You can sort of see how it's opaque and you can 
see those little holes. There were probab ly a thousand or so phage that were put on 
this plate. There are severa l hundred anyway. And you can just count the number of 
holes and then you know how many phage you've got. OK? So that's this system. 
Now, what I'd like to now consider is how we could use genetics to  try and study the 
essentia l functions of that bacteriophage. 

How does it replicate? How does it make its coat? I want to study the things that are 
needed for it to be a phage, not something that's d ispensab le. I want to know 
essentia l functions. So that means I would have to use conditional mutants of some 
type so  that I could study it because otherwise if I broke something that was critical 
for the phage's life cycle I'd never get any phage and I couldn't do any genetics. 

So what I would do is I would look for temperature sensitive mutants. The phage. So 
they'll form plaques, let's say plaques at 30 degrees. No plaques at 37 degrees. And 
you go through, and this could be laborious or clever depending on how you set this 
up. But we could make a bunch of mutants. And let's call T1, T2, just g ive them 
names  like that as I isolate them. 

Now, what I want to show you are two absolutely standard and critical genetic ways 
of analyzing these mutants. They all look the same. Their phenotype  is they form 
plaques at 30 degrees. They don't form p laques at 37 degrees. They could be 
affecting one gene. We could have mutants in 50 genes. I don't know starting out. 
All I know is I've got mutants that are temperature sensitive. 

So genetics g ives you a coup le of ways of going at that that will tell you not only are 
they in the same gene or in the d ifferent gene. But it a lso will tell you something 
about their physical relationship along the DNA. And this is without know ing anything 
about what they do. So let me show you how that works. So the first genetic 
operation is called a complementation test. And  the thing that I hope will strike you 
about particularly these bacteriophage things  is these are so simp le. 

I've already told you basically all the techniques we're going to be using. We're going 
to be taking phage, we're going to be mixing it with bacteria, we're going to be 
putting them on a p late and we're going to be counting plaques. But we're not going 
to do anything else and we're going to learn stuff about whether mutations are in the 
same gene or different genes, between different mutants and something about the 
order of the genes on the chromosome. 

And that's the point I'm trying to drive home right now. So here's the first idea. Let's 
add the T1 mutant p lus the T2 mutant to some bacteria. So we'll put them both into 
the same test tube. And what we want is enough phage -- So every bacterium gets 
both. So we want to take, if we take T1 by itself it w ill grow plagues at 30 degrees, 
not at 37. T2 p laques at 30 degrees, no plaques at 37. 

Now we're going to take some bacteria and put enough that both of them will get 
into  the same thing. Now, of course, those bacteria are doomed because if anything 
happens, because they've got things inside them. So what we do now  is then we add 
a whole bunch of what we would call ind icator bacteria. These are ones that haven't 
been. And we'll put lots of those in, and we'll put many fewer of these and we'll mix 
these together. 

And then we'll plate them out under two different cond itions. Let's try it at 30 
degrees. Well, in that case, I think we can  figure out what would happen. Both T1 
and T2 can form p laques, so you'd expect to see plaques. And you would indeed see 
that if you did this experiment. Now, the other thing, though, this is where it gets 
interesting, is what would happen if we plated them at 37 degrees? Well, on their 
own neither of them can  form a plaque. 

But we've eng ineered it so  that there are two within each bacterium. So there are 
two possible outcomes, and let's think what they could be. We could either have 
mutations in the same gene that some particular gene, let's say a gene required for 
making the major protein  in the coat, that mutant one is affected in that gene and 
mutant two is affected in the same gene. 

So both of them got a broken coat protein. And so inside this bacterium, when the 
phage are trying to grow, what you've got is this one gene. And this is the T1 mutant 
and this is the T2 mutant. And maybe this one has got a mutation somewhere and 
the other one has got it somewhere else in the gene, but this gene is not functiona l. 
So we wouldn't get any p laques. But what if they were in different genes? Let's say 
one of the mutants was altered in the gene for a coat protein and the other one was 
altered in a gene that was necessary for replicating the phage DNA. 

So it's a situation like this. And let's say this is gene A and that's gene B. What do 
you think could happen now? Get plaques? Wouldn't get p laques? Yeah? I see a lot of 
nodding. We'd get plaques because this one has a good gene A, so it would make 
let's say the coat protein. This one has a good gene B so it could make the DNA 
polymerase for copying the phage DNA. 

And things would be fine. And so by this very, very simple test, we could take a 
whole lot of ts mutants and we could go through in a pare-w ise fashion, and we 
could say oh, I see, number one, number seven and number 54 apparently affect all 
mutations affecting one gene, and we could put them into categories by doing this. 
And we haven't done anything other than mix phage and bacteria and look to see 
whether there are p laques or not. 

I mean this  is very d ifferent than what a biochemist does. It's a d ifferent kind of 
thinking. And yet it's enormously powerful. So this procedure, which is one of the 
workhorses of a geneticist, is known as a complementation test. And depending on 
the organism it takes a whole bunch of different sort of technical forms. But that's 
the principle of the thing, that if you have one good copy of the gene and a broken 
one then you can survive in most cases because usua lly the one will be enough to 
get you through here. 

So that's one of the things that geneticists do. And see how powerful it is for 
something that's a very simp le manipulation. But let me now tell you the other kind 
of test that geneticists do. It's a slightly different principle but just as powerful and 
gives you a different kind of information. This  is known as a recombination test. So 
what we're going to do in this case now is we're going to allow two mutants to grow 
together in the same cell. 

Let's say two mutants. And we'll use T1 and T2 again to grow together in the same 
cell. Now, for example, remember up here we mixed both of them in this so they 
both were inside this bacteria and then when we plated it up, up here at 30 degrees 
we got plaques? We would have gotten p laques from every single infected bacteria. 
Well, those plaques probably have ten to the ninth phage in them. And those were 
phage that grew together under permissive conditions. 

OK? So let's take those, re-suspend them -- -- and bring  them over here. Now, we'll 
add them to some bacteria. So bacteria in here. But we're going to do it under 
different conditions now. We don't want comp lementation taking place, so we'll make 
sure that we have less than one phage -- -- per bacterium. So we cannot do this 
complementation thing anymore. 

We just got rid of it by using a different ratio of phage to  the bacteria. So now what I 
want to do, I'm going to plate this out at 37 degrees. We could add an ind icator if we 
wanted aga in. Well, that may seem like a stupid experiment in the sense that T1 
wouldn't grow by itself and T2 wouldn't grow by itself at 37 degrees. And all I've 
done is let them grow together. So if a ll we had  in that population was what we 
started with there wouldn't be any p laques. 

But if you do that what you will find is you'll find some rare plaques. And these are 
what are known as recombinants. And let me now just g ive you a sense of how these 
recombinants arise. So let's imag ine that this is the mutation and here's our T1 
bacterium. Here's  its DNA. And let's say there's a function here that it's wild type for 
and it's got a mutation down here. The other one, T2 has got the mutation here but 
it's w ild type for there. 

That's the kind of thing we were ta lking about, a gene A and a gene B, although it's 
more general than that. But what happens when these things are growing together is 
under rare circumstances this interesting thing happens. Since this is the two strands 
of DNA and since these phages are a lmost  identical and this p iece of DNA is the 
same as that piece of DNA. And if a break ever happened in one of these strands, 
what can happen is it can invade the other strand and displace it. 

And this strand can do a little switcheroo and come over here like this. So now we've 
got the plus and the plus and the minus and the minus. So this is an intermediate 
but these things happen. You get little breaks in DNA  from DNA damage and other 

things. And the other piece of DNA can go off and pioneer and find another molecule. 
And then there are enzymes that resolve this. 

And if we cut it right here, we'd just go back to what we had before. But if you cut 
this strand here, and you may have to sit down and draw this out because this, for 
me, was not intuitive when I was learning this thing. You'll see what happens now. 
The end of this strand w ill go over and join to there. The end of this strand will join 
and go here. And what you w ill get out of that is one phage that's got both of the 
pluses and one of the phage that's got both of the minuses. 

And I'll ca ll this sort of T1, T2 to indicate that it has got both of the mutations. So 
this would be what we could detect over there. That would be one of the rare w ild 
types. And I'll assert to you that this guy here has two mutations in it instead of one. 
What's the phenotype of the one that has both mutations? It cannot grow. It can 
make plaques at 30 degrees. It cannot make plaques at 37. If I got up and sa id I'm 
sure this phage has two mutations. 

It has both T1 and T2 mutations in it. And I say prove  it to me. Anybody see how 
you could do it given what I've already told you? Exactly. If I tried it in a 
complementation test w ith T1 it wouldn't comp liment because both would be broken 
in T1. If I tried to comp lement T2  it wouldn't work because  it's broken in T2. And just 
by using these tiny little simp le manipulations that I've told you, I can even see that 
something that has got a double mutant we could sort it out at the bench. 

You could wa lk in and tell me the next morning what the result was. In  fact, phage 
grows so  fast you might even be able to do it  in the morning and tell me before you 
went home at night. So this is, as I say, called a recombination test. And it's giving 
you a different kind of information, but it's an extraordinarily powerful technique for 
another reason, is that the recomb ination frequency can be measured. 

We'll ca ll RF. And  this is the recombinants over the total. So, in our case, this would 
be the number of wild type, plus the number of these doub le mutants over the tota l 
of T1 p lus the total of T2, which would be the dominant members of this population. 
Because this is a relatively rare event, plus the wild type, p lus the T1, T2. And the 
thing that is so useful is the probab ility of, geneticists ca ll this a crossover, this kind 
of crossover happening is proportiona l to the distance between these things. 

If they're a very long d istance apart there's a lot of DNA, and the chances of it 
happening are much higher than if the two mutations are very close together. It 
makes sense just from First Principles. So the recombination frequency varies as the 
distance -- -- between the mutations. So let's  imagine that I do a cross like this. 
We'd grow T1 p lus T2 and we measure the recombination frequency, and I find that 
it's 4%. 

4% of the plaques are mutants out of everything that's in there. And let me try 
another one. I'll take T2 and I'll cross it w ith the next mutant phage of isolated T3. 
And let's say, in this case, the recomb ination  frequency is 5%. Because I know 
they're different d istances, but if you think about it you'll rea lize there are two kinds 
of maps we can draw. These data are compatible with the gene order being one, 
two, with this being a distance that corresponds to a 4% recombination frequency, 
and three with this being the distance that corresponds to the 5%. 

But it's a lso compatible, isn't it, w ith this where we have one, two and three here. 
There's the 4%. And from there to there is the 5%. Yeah, that's right. Two to three. 
One to two is 4% and two to three is 5% in both of these. One to  two is 4%. What 
did I do wrong? Two. I guess I've got to do it this way, two, one. Is that going to do 
it? What did I do with my example here? Yeah. 

Hang on a second. OK. Let's go back to where I was and see if I can reconstruct this. 
OK. There's one, and two  is 4%, and we want two to three 5%. OK, right. So it's 
going to be here. Here we go. Two to three. Excuse me. It's got to be farther over 
here. There's three. There's the 5%. OK. Now we've got it, once I change these 
numbers. The 4%, the 5%, the 4%, the 5%. OK. I thought I was over this cold. 

I guess I'm not quite over this cold. OK. Could you devise an experiment that would 
distinguish between those maps? Yeah? Yeah. You've got it. Take T1 and T3. One of 
those you'll get a 9%. One of them you'll get a 1%. Isn't that amaz ing? I mean it's 
so simp le, but I think you can perhaps see some of the power of genetics here. All 
we've done is we've got things that we know can form plaques at 30 and not at 37. 

We haven't done anything other than mix them with bacteria and then count 
plaques. And we've been ab le to make inferences in a living organism about 
mutations in genes that are absolutely essential for that organism to grow. So what 
phage geneticists were ab le to do over the years then was they would make a map 
of all of these d ifferent genes down to the phage genome and then the biochemist 
would go in and work it out. 

And people studying mice would make maps of genes a long mice. And it's only been 
in the last handful of years we've been able to go in and sequence the DNA and find 
out where a ll of these things are. So I w ill see you guys after. I hope you have a 
wonderful spring break. And I think you'll rea lly enjoy hearing Penny. And we'll start 
in on dip loid genetics and Mendel and stuff as soon as we get back. 

OK? So see you in a little bit.
