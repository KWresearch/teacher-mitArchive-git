<p></p>
<p>All righty. So we've been talking about, the last time we talked  about the different ways that this extraordinary process called  evolution has resulted in different ways that organisms exploit the  carbon and energy sources that are available on earth. And as we talked  about that we find that whatever is thermodynamically possible in terms  of redox gradients in the environment you will find an organism that has  evolved to exploit it.</p>
<p>And one thing I haven't mentioned to you  guys yet -- Maybe I've mentioned it but I haven't driven it home is that  in the microbial world right now 99.9% of the microbes that live on  earth have never been cultivated. So it's a vastly unknown universe, the  details. So the metabolic pathways that I'm describing here are just  the tip of the iceberg in terms of what's possible.</p>
<p>So last time  we were talking at the biochemical scale. This time we're now going to  scale up and think of these biochemical processes on a global level. And  we're going to talk about primary productivity which is really just  another word for the collective photosynthesis of all of the  photosynthesizers on earth. So who are the dominant primary producers?  Well, we've already talked about this. And just to get ourselves  oriented let's think of in water the primary photosynthetic organisms,  the primary producers are phytoplankton.</p>
<p>And let's just look at  one phytoplankton cell, OK? This is a single cell so this would be maybe  ten microns in size. And inside that cell we have a chloroplast, and  you've learned all this in other lectures and including my lectures,  which takes up CO2 and evolves oxygen and makes sugars which go to,  what's the organelle where respiration takes place? Mitochondria.</p>
<p>Which  goes to the mitochondrion and is respired. CO2 is evolved and oxygen is  taken up. So this little single cell gets through life through  photosynthesis primarily, but it also takes the products of  photosynthesis and burns them inside the cell. So this is what we call  respiration. And it's important to remember that even photosynthetic  organisms respire, OK? But then there's this whole other group of  organisms that last time we called heterotrophs that can only respire.</p>
<p>They  rely on the photosynthetic product from photosynthetic organisms. So  that's in water. And then on land the main primary producers,  productivity are plants. And we'll just symbolize these as a tree. And  we all know that the tree takes up CO2, evolves oxygen. If you blow this  up, you just take a leaf, OK? That's a blowup. And then you blowup  again and take a cell from the leaf.</p>
<p>This cell is identical in  function to the single microscopic phytoplankton cell, OK? So the  process in both of these ecosystems, this could be grass, it could be  moss, it could be anything else, the process is the same in terms of  what's involved in productivity. OK. Now, you have a handout for this  lecture that has a lot of the definitions that I'm going to now very  briefly put on the board.</p>
<p>Oh, I should tell you also that in the  last ten minutes of the lecture I'm going to show you another incredible  clip from the Blue Planet series that I showed you last time so you  have something to look forward to. So let's define some terms. Biomass  we're going to call B. And as I said this is all in the handout. So I'm  just going to give you the short version here. And the units of this can  be of course anything, but normally it's something like grams carbon  per meter squared.</p>
<p>And what does that mean? Well, it means if you  have, in a terrestrial ecosystem, OK, where you have trees, it would  mean that you would calculate the biomass. You'd take a square meter and  you'd integrate up and collect all of the biomass in that surface area,  OK? So that's what that means. So grams carbon in that square meter.  For an aquatic ecosystem it's the opposite.</p>
<p>You take a square  meter of the surface water, let's put some waves on here, and you  integrate all the way down. How far? When will you not have anymore  primary, oh, no, biomass? When will you no longer have any more  photosynthetic biomass in the oceans or in a lake? Pycnocline. Oh,  that's a good answer. Not necessarily, though. But it often corresponds  to that. The pycnocline is a density gradient in aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>But  what is absolutely essential for photosynthesis? Light. Light. So you  go down until there's no light. Absolutely. There won't be any  photosynthesis where there's no light. This is the one thing we know for  sure, OK? And that's usually in the oceans around 200 meters. And in  lakes it depends on how rich they are. In the Charles River it's about  one meter because it's such a mess.</p>
<p>In fact, well, I shouldn't say  a mess, but it's very productive. In fact, legend has it, and I don't  know if this is true, that it's actually safe to swim in the Charles in  terms of the water quality, but the reason you're not supposed to swim  is because the visibility is so bad that if anything happened they'd  never find you. But I don't know if that is true.</p>
<p>That could be an  urban legend. OK, so we're going to define gross primary productivity.  GPP, gross primary productivity is the rate of photosynthesis -- -- and  grams carbon per meter squared per year. And of course the units here  are not, the absolute units, this could be per day and this could be per  square millimeter if you wanted, but the units are amount per unit area  per unit time, OK? And then we're going to define the respiration rate,  the respiration of the autotrophs.</p>
<p>So this would be the  respiration rate of the photosynthetic organisms, which is why we call  them R sub A. And that's going to have the same units, OK? So it's grams  carbon per meter squared per year respired. And net primary  productivity is then gross primary productivity minus R sub A so net  primary productivity of an ecosystem is the amount of carbon CO2 that's  drawn into the system through photosynthesis minus the amount that was  respired by the plants, by the organisms that did the photosynthesis.</p>
<p>In  a sense, you can think of it as the amount of carbon that actually goes  into a plant growing, OK, that goes into the biomass of a tree or that  goes into the division of a single celled phytoplankton into two  phytoplankton. And then a lot of that is lost through respiration. OK.  We can also define mean residance time -- -- as MRT, which is the  biomass divided by the net primary productivity.</p>
<p>So what are the  units of the mean residance time? It should be obvious but -- Years,  right, or time. Mean residence time is time. And that's really, if you  want to think about it, if you think of yourself as a carbon atom that's  drawn into a tree through photosynthesis, it's the average amount of  time you will spend, your one atom in that tree. OK? It's the average  residence, the mean residence time.</p>
<p>Well, actually, that's wrong,  right? It's not the amount of time that you, that one atom will spend,  but it's on average the amount of time that atoms will spend in the  tree. OK. And then the fractional turnover -- -- is equal to one over  the mean residence time. And it has the units of obviously years to the  minus one. And it's the fraction, if you think of a tree again, it's the  fraction of the carbon in that tree that is renewed by new carbon every  year.</p>
<p>Now, these two concepts will become very important again  when we start to talk about global biogeochemical cycles. And we'll talk  about the residence time, the various elements in various components in  the earth system. OK. So now let's go on and look at, first of all, I  should have shown this slide last time. I'm trying to not walk around  too much because this fellow is filming me or filming these classes.</p>
<p>But  we should briefly take a look at the absorption spectrum of all of the  plants in the biosphere. Could we turn the lights down a little? Or I  guess I'm in charge of that. There. A little bit better maybe. This is  the absorption spectrum of the pigment chlorophyll, chlorophyll A that  is the pigment that all green plants have and they use to absorb  sunlight. And you'll notice that over the course of evolution all of  these white bands are accessory pigments.</p>
<p>That different organisms  have evolved to also capture light. And they pass on that energy to the  chlorophyll molecule. And the point is that if you look across all of  the visible light and even beyond there are pigments that have evolved  to capture that solar energy collectively in the ecosystem. OK, so let's  look at, now we're going to look at world net primary productivity. So  essentially photosynthesis on a global scale.</p>
<p>And I'm going to  tell you right up front. These numbers are extremely approximated. And  I've taken these numbers from various textbooks. Your textbook doesn't  even have a table like this in it. In fact, your textbook is very weak  in this section of biology. But there are always tradeoffs in choosing  textbooks. So I've taken this from textbooks and I've rounded off these  numbers. And so I just want you to go through and understand the  structure of the table.</p>
<p>The idea is not to memorize particular  numbers but understand and have a feeling for the relative amounts of  productivity in different ecosystems. So, first of all, here's our units  of grams per year, world net primary productivity. These are grams of  carbon, OK? And if we first look at the total amount on land, in this  particular table is 177 versus the marine total is 54.</p>
<p>But the new  estimates, I've taken this out of sort of more primarily literature  than textbooks, really show these numbers to be more like this. That  shows you how variable this is. It changes every decade. Showing that  the amount of photosynthesis in the oceans is roughly on par with the  amount on land. And to remind you of our units here, weight-wise this is  50 to 70 billion Volkswagen's worth of carbon.</p>
<p>I mean that's a  lot of carbon every year that is going into these ecosystems. OK, so  let's look and dissect the table a little bit. Looking at tropical  forests like the rainforest in the Amazon that are some of the most  productive ecosystems in the world. You can see that over here their net  primary productivity per meter squared is 2,000. And then you look down  here at the open ocean which on a per meter squared basis, a very  unproductive ecosystem, there are tiny little phytoplankton, is 100.</p>
<p>But  looking further, before I get to the but which is the punch line.  That's the trouble with animation. The biomass in the tropical forest is  enormous, obviously trees, whereas the biomass in the open ocean is  very tiny. But if we look at the percent of the surface of the earth  that is covered by these two different ecosystems the open ocean is huge  compared to the tropical forest.</p>
<p>So on a global scale, because of  the aerial coverage here these two ecosystems contribute equally, OK?  So it's a combination of net primary productivity and the coverage of  the global ocean. OK. Let's go back to that for a minute. So let's -- --  talk about turnover times or mean residence times. Just eyeballing it,  can you give me an estimate in terms of days, months, years, decades,  centuries, order of magnitude for the mean residence time of carbon in  all the phytoplankton in a marine ecosystem? Is it days, months, years,  centuries, decades? Well, don't guess.</p>
<p>Well, you can guess but  minutes is wrong. So having guessed minutes is wrong now you use your  analytical brain and you look at this, mean residence time, which is  biomass divided by net primary productivity. Here's the biomass. Round  that off. And here's the net primary productivity. And the units here is  years. Like a month did I hear? I didn't hear. Right. It's about  one-tenth of year which is about a month. About a month.</p>
<p>Does  everybody follow that? It's just to round this off, five over 50 is 0.1,  biomass over NPP. How about for the terrestrial ecosystem, what's the  average amount of time a carbon atom spends in the average tree? Years,  right? Decades. Many years. Maybe decades to centuries. This is a way we  think about these things. We don't have an exact number. But you want  to get an order of magnitude feeling.</p>
<p>So carbon is turning over  very, very fast in the marine ecosystem but very slowly in the  terrestrial ecosystem. And the simple way to think about that is that  phytoplankton don't have trunks, but there's a more complicated way to  think about it. OK, so now, all of this primary productivity that we've  made, all of this photosynthesis, as we talked about, is the base of the  food webs in all ecosystems.</p>
<p>And so we're going to start to  dissect this. This is a marine food web showing phytoplankton that are  eaten by zooplankton. We used to talk about food chains, but we well now  that it's not a chain. It's really a very complex web and very hard to  put organisms and assign them to particular sections. Phytoplankton are  eaten by zooplankton. Zooplankton are eaten by worms. You've got blue  crabs, barnacles, and the top predators shore birds and sea bass.</p>
<p>Now,  an important part of these food webs is also all of the carbon, the  primary productivity that is not eaten while it's alive. So some things  just die, right? You have dead carbon lying around. And that dead carbon  falls into what's called a different food web, the detritus food web.  And we're going to talk about that. And it comes from all of these  different components in the food web.</p>
<p>So now we're going to more  analytically look at the flow of carbon. And when we talk about carbon  we are also talking about energy, right? Carbon and energy are the same  thing. I mean they're interconvertable. So we're going to look at the  flow of carbon from the phytoplankton to the zooplankton through that  trophic level. And to do this we have to talk about some definitions.</p>
<p>And  again this is in your handout so I'm not going to write all this on the  board but we'll just walk through this. The flow of carbon or energy  through a trophic level, which is one of these links, OK? This is one  trophic level. This is the next trophic level. Or you can also think of  this as an organism. This type of analysis applies to both. And we start  out with the productivity at trophic level and minus one, OK? And so  the first would be primary productivity coming into the system.</p>
<p>Some  of that productivity, some of that carbon is not ingested by the next  trophic level. That's lost as dead organic matter, detritus, whatever we  want to call it. So that's D sub n the portion not consumed. Then some  of it is ingested by the organism, I sub n. And then some fraction of  that is assimilated by the organism. That means it's taken into its  biochemistry and goes toward building biomass.</p>
<p>And some of it is  lost as fecal matter produced, that's F sub n. And urine would also be a  part of this, waste products. And then some of it is then, the rest of  it is then available, oh, some of it, this is important, is lost as  respiration. And then the rest is available as productivity for the next  trophic level. OK. So different types of organisms. First, before we  get to that, using this analysis we can start to define efficiencies of  energy conversion through this system.</p>
<p>And this is because  different types of organisms assimilate carbon with different  efficiencies. And that is important in the flow of carbon through  different types of ecosystems. So let's look at the first efficiency  that would be I, ingested, reflecting the amount that's ingested  relative to the amount that's available. And this is called the  exploitation efficiency, OK? I sub n divided by P sub n minus one.</p>
<p>The  next one similarly would be A sub n, the amount that's assimilated  relative to the amount that's ingested. And that is the assimilation  efficiency. And finally the amount that goes to the next trophic level  divided by the amount that's assimilated, which is the production  efficiency, the amount that actually goes to productivity that is  assimilated. And these all multiplied together give you the ecological  efficiency.</p>
<p>And that is sometimes called the trophic transfer  efficiency. That's the amount of carbon that is basically lost as you go  through one trophic level. And usually, and we'll talk about this in a  minute, this is 10% to 20% actually makes it through the system, and the  rest is lost to respiration or detritus or fecal matter. OK, so let's  talk about now how different organisms vary in terms of efficiencies.</p>
<p>We  have, in terms of the exploitation efficiency, if you're talking about,  for example, tree insects. So insects feeding on trees is about 1% to  10%. They don't take that much of the tree. If it's grass to animals  it's more like 20%. And if it's phytoplankton to zooplankton it's more  like 20% to 40%. In other words, zooplankton harvests much of the  primary productivity, no, almost half of the productivity that the  phytoplankton have made.</p>
<p>OK. What about assimilation efficiency?  How does this vary between organisms? Well, this one, you can think  about it as if you eat food that is, I was going to say not you, but it  is true, we are all animals so it applies to us, too. If you eat food  that is similar in composition to your own bodily composition you're  more efficient at assimilating it because you don't have to break it  down as much and reorganize it.</p>
<p>So herbivores, organisms that eat  plant matter are 20% to 50% efficient in their assimilation. But  carnivores is more like 80%. Because you are meat and if you eat meat  you don't have as much waste than if you eat a lot of fiber. So there  are big differences there. And then in terms of, that is not a value  judgment on whether you should eat meat or not. I just want to make that  very clear. What? OK. But later on we'll talk about the difference  between eating meat globally and being vegetarians in terms of utilizing  primary productivity on the earth.</p>
<p>But in terms of production  efficiency you have warm-blooded organisms having a 2% production  efficiency. Whereas cold-blooded have a 40% production efficiency. Why  would that be? Yes. If you're warm-blooded, does anybody know the  technical term for that? It is if you are homeotherm. Or what did you  say? Endothermic. I'm not sure. I think that's chemistry.</p>
<p>It  sounded good, though. So there are homeotherms and heterotherms. It  doesn't matter. The point is that these have to maintain their body  temperature like we do. That takes a lot of energy. Whereas, these go  with the flow so to speak, that technical term. But that doesn't take as  much energy. If it's cold they just let their body get cold. They don't  burn, burn, burn to keep the temperature constant.</p>
<p>OK, so that's  how organisms differ. Now let's move on to the next chapter in which now  we are going to look at -- We were looking at the flow through one  trophic level. Now we're going to connect a whole bunch of trophic  levels. We're going to look at the flow of energy through this component  of this food web and do a more thorough analysis. OK, so this gets kind  of messy but let's start here.</p>
<p>I better use the powerful one. OK,  so each one of these is what we call a trophic level. And these are the  primary producers, the photosynthetic organisms. Here is our gross  primary production absorbing sunlight. Some of that is lost to heat.  Some of that is lost to respiration. Here is our little R sub A,  remember? Right here. And some of it, the net primary productivity is  available for ingestion at the next trophic level which are the  herbivores.</p>
<p>So all we're doing here is ganging up a whole bunch of  those individual analyses. And then the next trophic levels are the  carnivores and then the second carnivores. And the number of links you  have here is something that is obviously determined by the efficiency of  transfer from one to another and the total amount of energy that comes  into the system.</p>
<p>So here in our ecosystem we have carbon being  lost at each step to detritus. And you have feces at each link. This all  goes down and becomes part of the detritus food web. And in that you  have two forms of carbon. You have particulate organic carbon which is  pieces of dead carbon floating around, dead leaves, dead phytoplankton,  whatever. And then you also have dissolved organic carbon.</p>
<p>When  these plants die and the phytoplankton die they burst open. And the  glucose and amino acids and all of that dissolve into the water in the  system. And that becomes dissolved organic carbon which is available for  this microbial food web, an entirely different food web that's coupled  to the system. So you have the detritivore. This the grazing food web  here. The waste from that goes to the detritivores and the microbes.</p>
<p>And  then whatever is left over after that is called refractory carbon. That  means none of the creatures are able to break it open and really get  energy out of it. And in the big picture what is this? We talked about  it actually last time. Fossil fuel, exactly. This is the carbon that  actually accumulates over time that when ecosystems are finished  processing all of the primary production.</p>
<p>OK, so I'm trying to  time this right so that we make sure we have time for the movie. So  let's look at a couple of ways we can think about this. Let's just  compare. If we look at the open ocean ecosystem versus the tropical  forest. And the average, oh, I forgot one thing. OK. If we take now the  gross primary productivity. And I'm going to circle all of the  respirations. See the purple here? So this is all the carbon that's  being fixed.</p>
<p>This is that is lost to respiration. And we can  define a new parameter which is net ecosystem production. And that is  gross primary production minus the respiration of all of the  autotrophies, R sub A, minus the respiration of all of the heterotrophic  components of the system. So that would be the herbivores, carnivores,  detritivores, microorganisms. That's all the carbon that's respired and  lost to CO2.</p>
<p>So you can add this to this. So we'd have net  ecosystem production. Production equals GPP minus RA minus the sum of  all the heterotrophs. Now, in very mature ecosystems this net ecosystem  production is essentially nothing. All right? Everything that's produced  is consumed. For example, in a tropical rainforest you don't have a  huge buildup of organic carbon in a tropical rainforest. Everything  that's produced is basically consumed and this is zero.</p>
<p>But in a  young forest, say a plantation at the extreme where you plant trees and  they're increasing in biomass, then obviously this net ecosystem  production is a positive number. What if net ecosystem production is a  negative number? It won't be there for long, right? You've got to have  things photosynthesizing net at least enough to maintain the ecosystem. I  mean you can have it for a transient for not any steady state.</p>
<p>OK.  All right. Talking about ecological efficiencies again. If we talk  about the average -- The average ecological efficiency of the open ocean  is about 25% and of the tropical rain forest is about 5%. So the  average number of trophic levels, that's basically the number of links  in the food web in these two systems is about 7.1 and 3.2. In other  words, when you have more efficiency of transfer from one link to  another you can have more links obviously.</p>
<p>So getting back to  humans again, and this gets back to in terms of what we might think  about as a global human society. If you go from wheat to man you lose  90% of the energy in that transfer. If you go from wheat to cows to man  you lose 90% here and you lose 90% here. So obviously in terms of  feeding the world it's much better to go directly from wheat to humans  than to go from wheat to cows to humans.</p>
<p>You all know this but  it's important to remember that. And unfortunately the trend in the  world is to go more from here to here instead of the other way around.  Just something to remember in terms of the application of this  knowledge. OK. Finally very quickly I'm going to skip over this and go  to another way to look at what we've been talking about.</p>
<p>It's just  another diagram of the same thing. You have the photosynthetic  organisms that the entire world depends on, this productivity for food  and fiber. And that most of that is lost through respiration and the  rest goes to the other organisms including detritivores. So a big  question is how much of this global primary productivity, this global  photosynthesis have humans taken over? It's really hard to answer that  question, OK, but a lot of ecologists have been working very hard at  understanding the fraction of global photosynthesis that has been what's  called co-opted by humans.</p>
<p>And the estimates range from 10% to  55%. The amount that we use directly as food or fuel or fiber or timber  is not that great, but there's a lot of productivity that's diverted as  crop waste, burning, et cetera. And land conversion obviously uses up a  lot of habitat and productivity. So the significant point here is that  as we co-opt this primary productivity we change dramatically all of the  food webs that rely on it, and that is what is part of the path to  extinction of a lot of species.</p>
<p>And the big question is how much  can we co-opt? I mean we're on the road to taking over the primary  productivity of the earth, there's no question, completely. Unless we  set up reserves that's it, that's where we're marching. Now, when we're  in charge of it, is it going to function the way we need it to function  to maintain our atmosphere and to provide us with the food and fiber  that we need? That's still an open question.</p>
<p>OK, so now I'm going  to show you this really neat DVD because these pictures of food webs are  deadly dull and don't represent anything at all of what the reality is  like. So I'm going to show you three weeks in the life of a real food  web. And I want you to think about two things when you're watching it.  Don't just think you're at home in front of your TV watching a nature  show and going brain dead or something.</p>
<p>Think about what you've  learned in this class. So think about the gigatons of carbon that are  flowing through this system. More importantly this entire food web and  everything that's going on in it is orchestrated by the information in  the genes of the organisms in the food web. That's the information  content that structures this whole thing. And how it's all orchestrated  and coordinated and happens the same way more or less every year is  absolutely mind blowing as far as I'm concern and a major, major  challenge for ecology and for molecular ecology.</p>
<p>OK.</p>
