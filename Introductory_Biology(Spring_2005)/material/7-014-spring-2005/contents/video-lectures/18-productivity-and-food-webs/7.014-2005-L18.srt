1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:15
All righty.

2
00:00:15 --> 00:00:21
So we've been talking about,
the last time we talked about the

3
00:00:21 --> 00:00:27
different ways that this
extraordinary process called

4
00:00:27 --> 00:00:33
evolution has resulted in different
ways that organisms exploit the

5
00:00:33 --> 00:00:40
carbon and energy sources that are
available on earth.

6
00:00:40 --> 00:00:45
And as we talked about that we find
that whatever is thermodynamically

7
00:00:45 --> 00:00:51
possible in terms of redox gradients
in the environment you will find an

8
00:00:51 --> 00:00:57
organism that has evolved to exploit
it.  And one thing I haven't

9
00:00:57 --> 00:01:02
mentioned to you guys yet --
Maybe I've mentioned it but I

10
00:01:02 --> 00:01:08
haven't driven it home is that in
the microbial world right now 99.

11
00:01:08 --> 00:01:13
% of the microbes that life on earth
have never been cultivated.

12
00:01:13 --> 00:01:19
So it's a vastly unknown universe,
the details.  So the metabolic

13
00:01:19 --> 00:01:24
pathways that I'm describing here
are just the tip of the iceberg in

14
00:01:24 --> 00:01:30
terms of what's possible.
So last time we were talking at the

15
00:01:30 --> 00:01:36
biochemical scale.
This time we're now going to scale

16
00:01:36 --> 00:01:43
up and think of these biochemical
processes on a global level.

17
00:01:43 --> 00:01:49
And we're going to talk about
primary productivity which is really

18
00:01:49 --> 00:01:56
just another word for the collective
photosynthesis of all of the

19
00:01:56 --> 00:02:02
photosynthesizers on earth.
So who are the dominant primary

20
00:02:02 --> 00:02:07
producers?  Well,
we've already talked about this.

21
00:02:07 --> 00:02:13
And just to get ourselves oriented
let's think of in water the primary

22
00:02:13 --> 00:02:18
photosynthetic organisms,
the primary producers are

23
00:02:18 --> 00:02:23
phytoplankton.
And let's just look at one

24
00:02:23 --> 00:02:29
phytoplankton cell,
OK?  This is a single cell so this

25
00:02:29 --> 00:02:36
would be maybe ten microns in size.
And inside that cell we have a

26
00:02:36 --> 00:02:44
chloroplast, and you've learned all
this in other lectures and including

27
00:02:44 --> 00:02:52
my lectures, which takes up CO2 and
evolves oxygen and makes sugars

28
00:02:52 --> 00:03:00
which go to, what's the organelle
where respiration takes place?

29
00:03:00 --> 00:03:07
Mitochondria.  Which goes to the
mitochondrion and is respired.

30
00:03:07 --> 00:03:14
CO2 is evolved and oxygen is taken
up.  So this little single cell gets

31
00:03:14 --> 00:03:21
through life through photosynthesis
primarily, but it also takes the

32
00:03:21 --> 00:03:28
products of photosynthesis and burns
them inside the cell.

33
00:03:28 --> 00:03:34
So this is what we call respiration.
And it's important to remember that

34
00:03:34 --> 00:03:40
even photosynthetic organisms
respire, OK?  But then there's this

35
00:03:40 --> 00:03:46
whole other group of organisms that
last time we called heterotrophs

36
00:03:46 --> 00:03:52
that can only respire.
They rely on the photosynthetic

37
00:03:52 --> 00:03:58
product from photosynthetic
organisms.  So that's in water.

38
00:03:58 --> 00:04:04
And then on land the main primary
producers, productivity are plants.

39
00:04:04 --> 00:04:09
And we'll just symbolize these as a
tree.  And we all know that the tree

40
00:04:09 --> 00:04:15
takes up CO2, evolves oxygen.
If you blow this up, you just take

41
00:04:15 --> 00:04:21
a leaf, OK?  That's a blowup.
And then you blowup again and take

42
00:04:21 --> 00:04:27
a cell from the leaf.
This cell is identical in function

43
00:04:27 --> 00:04:33
to the single microscopic
phytoplankton cell, OK?

44
00:04:33 --> 00:04:38
So the process in both of these
ecosystems, this could be grass,

45
00:04:38 --> 00:04:43
it could be moss, it could be
anything else,

46
00:04:43 --> 00:04:48
the process is the same in terms of
what's involved in productivity.

47
00:04:48 --> 00:04:53
OK.  Now, you have a handout for
this lecture that has a lot of the

48
00:04:53 --> 00:04:59
definitions that I'm going to now
very briefly put on the board.

49
00:04:59 --> 00:05:03
Oh, I should tell you also that in
the last ten minutes of the lecture

50
00:05:03 --> 00:05:08
I'm going to show you another
incredible clip from the Blue Planet

51
00:05:08 --> 00:05:12
series that I showed you last time
so you have something to look

52
00:05:12 --> 00:05:17
forward to.  So let's
define some terms.

53
00:05:17 --> 00:05:26
Biomass we're going to call B.

54
00:05:26 --> 00:05:31
And as I said this is all in the
handout.

55
00:05:31 --> 00:05:36
So I'm just going to give you the
short version here.

56
00:05:36 --> 00:05:41
And the units of this can be of
course anything,

57
00:05:41 --> 00:05:46
but normally it's something like
grams carbon per meter squared.

58
00:05:46 --> 00:05:51
And what does that mean?  Well,
it means if you have, in a

59
00:05:51 --> 00:05:56
terrestrial ecosystem,
OK, where you have trees,

60
00:05:56 --> 00:06:02
it would mean that you would
calculate the biomass.

61
00:06:02 --> 00:06:07
You'd take a square meter and you'd
integrate up and collect all of the

62
00:06:07 --> 00:06:13
biomass in that surface area,
OK?  So that's what that means.

63
00:06:13 --> 00:06:18
So grams carbon in that square
meter.  For an aquatic ecosystem

64
00:06:18 --> 00:06:24
it's the opposite.
You take a square meter of the

65
00:06:24 --> 00:06:30
surface water,
let's put some waves on here,

66
00:06:30 --> 00:06:35
and you integrate all the way down.
How far?  When will you not have

67
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
anymore primary,
oh, no, biomass?  When will you no

68
00:06:39 --> 00:06:44
longer have any more photosynthetic
biomass in the oceans or in a lake?

69
00:06:44 --> 00:06:54
Pycnocline.  Oh,

70
00:06:54 --> 00:06:58
that's a good answer.
Not necessarily, though.

71
00:06:58 --> 00:07:02
But it often corresponds to that.
The pycnocline is a density gradient

72
00:07:02 --> 00:07:06
in aquatic ecosystems.
But what is absolutely essential

73
00:07:06 --> 00:07:10
for photosynthesis?
Light.  Light.  So you go down

74
00:07:10 --> 00:07:14
until there's no light.
Absolutely.  There won't be any

75
00:07:14 --> 00:07:18
photosynthesis where there's no
light.  This is the one thing we

76
00:07:18 --> 00:07:22
know for sure,
OK?  And that's usually in the

77
00:07:22 --> 00:07:26
oceans around 200 meters.
And in lakes it depends on how rich

78
00:07:26 --> 00:07:30
they are.  In the Charles River it's
about one meter because

79
00:07:30 --> 00:07:34
it's such a mess.
In fact, well,

80
00:07:34 --> 00:07:38
I shouldn't say a mess,
but it's very productive.

81
00:07:38 --> 00:07:42
In fact, legend has it, and I don't
know if this is true,

82
00:07:42 --> 00:07:46
that it's actually safe to swim in
the Charles in terms of the water

83
00:07:46 --> 00:07:50
quality, but the reason you're not
supposed to swim is because the

84
00:07:50 --> 00:07:54
visibility is so bad that if
anything happened they'd never find

85
00:07:54 --> 00:07:58
you.  But I don't know if that is
true.  That could be

86
00:07:58 --> 00:08:04
an urban legend.
OK, so we're going to define gross

87
00:08:04 --> 00:08:13
primary productivity.
GPP, gross primary productivity is

88
00:08:13 --> 00:08:23
the rate of photosynthesis --

89
00:08:23 --> 00:08:29
-- and grams carbon per meter
squared per year.

90
00:08:29 --> 00:08:34
And of course the units here are not,
the absolute units,

91
00:08:34 --> 00:08:40
this could be per day and this could
be per square millimeter if you

92
00:08:40 --> 00:08:45
wanted, but the units are amount per
unit area per unit time,

93
00:08:45 --> 00:08:51
OK?  And then we're going to define
the respiration rate,

94
00:08:51 --> 00:08:57
the respiration of the autotrophs.
So this would be the respiration

95
00:08:57 --> 00:09:03
rate of the photosynthetic organisms,
which is why we call them R sub A.

96
00:09:03 --> 00:09:10
And that's going to have the same
units, OK?  So it's grams carbon per

97
00:09:10 --> 00:09:17
meter squared per unit respired.
And net primary productivity is

98
00:09:17 --> 00:09:24
then gross primary productivity
minus, so net primary productivity

99
00:09:24 --> 00:09:31
of an ecosystem is the amount of
carbon, CO2 that's drawn into the

100
00:09:31 --> 00:09:38
system through photosynthesis minus
the amount that was respired by the

101
00:09:38 --> 00:09:45
plants, by the organisms that did
the photosynthesis.

102
00:09:45 --> 00:09:50
In a sense, you can think of it as
the amount of carbon that actually

103
00:09:50 --> 00:09:56
goes into a plant growing,
OK, that goes into the biomass of a

104
00:09:56 --> 00:10:02
tree or that goes into the division
of a single celled phytoplankton

105
00:10:02 --> 00:10:08
into two phytoplankton.
And then a lot of that is lost

106
00:10:08 --> 00:10:16
through respiration.  OK.

107
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
We can also define mean
resonance time --

108
00:10:19 --> 00:10:28
-- as MRT, which is the biomass

109
00:10:28 --> 00:10:34
divided by the net primary
productivity.

110
00:10:34 --> 00:10:37
So what are the units of the mean
resonance time?  It should

111
00:10:37 --> 00:10:43
be obvious but --

112
00:10:43 --> 00:10:47
Years, right, or time.
Mean resonance time is time.

113
00:10:47 --> 00:10:51
And that's really, if you want to
think about it,

114
00:10:51 --> 00:10:55
if you think of yourself as a carbon
atom that's drawn into a tree

115
00:10:55 --> 00:10:59
through photosynthesis,
it's the average amount of time you

116
00:10:59 --> 00:11:04
will spend, your one
atom in that tree.

117
00:11:04 --> 00:11:08
OK?  It's the average resonance,
the mean resonance time.  Well,

118
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12
actually, that's wrong,
right?  It's not the amount of time

119
00:11:12 --> 00:11:17
that you, that one atom will spend,
but it's on average the amount of

120
00:11:17 --> 00:11:21
time that atoms will spend in the
tree.  OK.  And then the

121
00:11:21 --> 00:11:30
fractional turnover --

122
00:11:30 --> 00:11:35
-- is equal to one over the mean
resonance time.

123
00:11:35 --> 00:11:40
And it has the units of obviously
years to the minus one.

124
00:11:40 --> 00:11:45
And it's the fraction, if you think
of a tree again,

125
00:11:45 --> 00:11:50
it's the fraction of the carbon in
that tree that is renewed by new

126
00:11:50 --> 00:11:56
carbon every year.
Now, these two concepts will become

127
00:11:56 --> 00:12:01
very important again when we start
to talk about global biogeochemical

128
00:12:01 --> 00:12:07
cycles.
And we'll talk about the resonance

129
00:12:07 --> 00:12:13
time, the various elements in
various components in the earth

130
00:12:13 --> 00:12:20
system.  OK.  So now let's go on and
look at, first of all,

131
00:12:20 --> 00:12:27
I should have shown this slide last
time.  I'm trying to not walk around

132
00:12:27 --> 00:12:33
too much because this fellow is
filming me or filming

133
00:12:33 --> 00:12:39
these classes.
But we should briefly take a look at

134
00:12:39 --> 00:12:44
the absorption spectrum of all of
the plants in the biosphere.

135
00:12:44 --> 00:12:50
Could we turn the lights down a
little?  Or I guess I'm

136
00:12:50 --> 00:13:01
in charge of that.

137
00:13:01 --> 00:13:06
There.  A little bit better maybe.
This is the absorption spectrum of

138
00:13:06 --> 00:13:11
the pigment chlorophyll,
chlorophyll A that is the pigment

139
00:13:11 --> 00:13:16
that all green plants have and they
use to absorb sunlight.

140
00:13:16 --> 00:13:21
And you'll notice that over the
course of evolution all of these

141
00:13:21 --> 00:13:26
white bands are accessory pigments.
That different organisms have

142
00:13:26 --> 00:13:31
evolved to also capture light.
And they pass on that energy to the

143
00:13:31 --> 00:13:35
chlorophyll molecule.
And the point is that if you look

144
00:13:35 --> 00:13:40
across all of the visible light and
even beyond there are pigments that

145
00:13:40 --> 00:13:45
have evolved to capture that solar
energy collectively in the ecosystem.

146
00:13:45 --> 00:13:49
OK, so let's look at,
now we're going to look at world net

147
00:13:49 --> 00:13:54
primary productivity.
So essentially photosynthesis on a

148
00:13:54 --> 00:13:59
global scale.  And I'm going to tell
you right up front.

149
00:13:59 --> 00:14:03
These numbers are extremely
approximated.  And I've taken these

150
00:14:03 --> 00:14:07
numbers from various textbooks.
Your textbook doesn't even have a

151
00:14:07 --> 00:14:11
table like this in it.
In fact, your textbook is very weak

152
00:14:11 --> 00:14:16
in this section of biology.
But there are always tradeoffs in

153
00:14:16 --> 00:14:20
choosing textbooks.
So I've taken this from textbooks

154
00:14:20 --> 00:14:24
and I've rounded off these numbers.
And so I just want you to go

155
00:14:24 --> 00:14:29
through and understand the structure
of the table.

156
00:14:29 --> 00:14:34
The idea is not to memorize
particular numbers but understand

157
00:14:34 --> 00:14:40
and have a feeling for the relative
amounts of productivity in different

158
00:14:40 --> 00:14:45
ecosystems.  So,
first of all, here's our units of

159
00:14:45 --> 00:14:51
grams per year,
world net primary productivity.

160
00:14:51 --> 00:14:57
These are grams of carbon, OK?  And
if we first look at the total amount

161
00:14:57 --> 00:15:03
on land, in this particular table is
177 versus the marine total is 54.

162
00:15:03 --> 00:15:07
But the new estimates,
I've taken this out of sort of more

163
00:15:07 --> 00:15:12
primarily literature than textbooks,
really show these numbers to be more

164
00:15:12 --> 00:15:17
like this.  That shows you how
variable this is.

165
00:15:17 --> 00:15:21
It changes every decade.
Showing that the amount of

166
00:15:21 --> 00:15:26
photosynthesis in the oceans is
roughly on par with the amount on

167
00:15:26 --> 00:15:31
land.  And to remind you of our
units here, weight-wise this is 50

168
00:15:31 --> 00:15:36
to 70 billion Volkswagen's
worth of carbon.

169
00:15:36 --> 00:15:42
I mean that's a lot of carbon every
year that is going into these

170
00:15:42 --> 00:15:48
ecosystems.  OK,
so let's look and dissect the table

171
00:15:48 --> 00:15:54
a little bit.  Looking at tropical
forests like the rainforest in the

172
00:15:54 --> 00:16:00
Amazon that are some of the most
productive ecosystems in the world.

173
00:16:00 --> 00:16:05
You can see that over here their net
primary productivity per meter

174
00:16:05 --> 00:16:10
squared is 2,000.
And then you look down here at the

175
00:16:10 --> 00:16:16
open ocean which on a per meter
squared basis,

176
00:16:16 --> 00:16:21
a very unproductive ecosystem,
there are tiny little phytoplankton,

177
00:16:21 --> 00:16:27
is 100.  But looking further, before
I get to the but which

178
00:16:27 --> 00:16:32
is the punch line.
That's the trouble with animation.

179
00:16:32 --> 00:16:38
The biomass in the tropical forest
is enormous, obviously trees,

180
00:16:38 --> 00:16:43
whereas the biomass in the open
ocean is very tiny.

181
00:16:43 --> 00:16:49
But if we look at the percent of
the surface of the earth that is

182
00:16:49 --> 00:16:54
covered by these two different
ecosystems the open ocean is huge

183
00:16:54 --> 00:17:00
compared to the tropical forest.
So on a global scale, because of

184
00:17:00 --> 00:17:06
the aerial coverage here these two
ecosystems contribute equally, OK?

185
00:17:06 --> 00:17:12
So it's a combination of net primary
productivity and the coverage of the

186
00:17:12 --> 00:17:18
global ocean.  OK.
Let's go back to that for a minute.

187
00:17:18 --> 00:17:28
So let's --

188
00:17:28 --> 00:17:34
-- talk about turnover times or mean
resonance times.

189
00:17:34 --> 00:17:40
Just eyeballing it,
can you give me an estimate in terms

190
00:17:40 --> 00:17:46
of days, months,
years, decades, centuries,

191
00:17:46 --> 00:17:52
order of magnitude for the mean
resonance time of carbon in all the

192
00:17:52 --> 00:17:59
phytoplankton in a
marine ecosystem?

193
00:17:59 --> 00:18:02
Is it days, months, years,
centuries, decades?

194
00:18:02 --> 00:18:13
Well, don't guess.

195
00:18:13 --> 00:18:18
Well, you can guess but minutes is
wrong.  So having guessed minutes is

196
00:18:18 --> 00:18:22
wrong now you use your analytical
brain and you look at this,

197
00:18:22 --> 00:18:27
mean resonance time, which is
biomass divided by net primary

198
00:18:27 --> 00:18:32
productivity.  Here's the biomass.
Round that off.

199
00:18:32 --> 00:18:36
And here's the net primary
productivity.

200
00:18:36 --> 00:18:47
And the units here is years.

201
00:18:47 --> 00:18:55
Like a month did I hear?  I didn't
hear.  Right.  It's about one-tenth

202
00:18:55 --> 00:19:02
of year which is about a month.
About a month.

203
00:19:02 --> 00:19:07
Does everybody follow that?
It's just to round this off,

204
00:19:07 --> 00:19:11
five over 50 is 0.1, biomass over
MPP.  How about for the terrestrial

205
00:19:11 --> 00:19:16
ecosystem, what's the average amount
of time a carbon atom spends

206
00:19:16 --> 00:19:24
in the average tree?

207
00:19:24 --> 00:19:27
Years, right?  Decades.
Many years.  Maybe decades to

208
00:19:27 --> 00:19:30
centuries.  This is a way we think
about these things.

209
00:19:30 --> 00:19:34
We don't have an exact number.
But you want to get an order of

210
00:19:34 --> 00:19:38
magnitude feeling.
So carbon is turning over very,

211
00:19:38 --> 00:19:43
very fast in the marine ecosystem
but very slowly in the terrestrial

212
00:19:43 --> 00:19:47
ecosystem.  And the simple way to
think about that is that

213
00:19:47 --> 00:19:52
phytoplankton don't have trunks,
but there's a more complicated way

214
00:19:52 --> 00:19:56
to think about it.
OK, so now, all of this primary

215
00:19:56 --> 00:20:01
productivity that we've made,
all of this photosynthesis, as we

216
00:20:01 --> 00:20:06
talked about, is the base of the
food webs in all ecosystems.

217
00:20:06 --> 00:20:10
And so we're going to start to
dissect this.  This is a marine food

218
00:20:10 --> 00:20:14
web showing phytoplankton that are
eaten by zooplankton.

219
00:20:14 --> 00:20:19
We used to talk about food chains,
but we well now that it's not a

220
00:20:19 --> 00:20:23
chain.  It's really a very complex
web and very hard to put organisms

221
00:20:23 --> 00:20:27
and assign them to particular
sections.  Phytoplankton are eaten

222
00:20:27 --> 00:20:32
by zooplankton.
Zooplankton are eaten by worms.

223
00:20:32 --> 00:20:37
You've got blue crabs, barnacles,
and the top predators shore birds

224
00:20:37 --> 00:20:43
and sea bass.  Now,
an important part of these food webs

225
00:20:43 --> 00:20:48
is also all of the carbon,
the primary productivity that is not

226
00:20:48 --> 00:20:53
eaten while it's alive.
So some things just die,

227
00:20:53 --> 00:20:58
right?  You have dead carbon lying
around.  And that dead carbon falls

228
00:20:58 --> 00:21:04
into what's called a different food
web, the detritus food web.

229
00:21:04 --> 00:21:08
And we're going to talk about that.
And it comes from all of these

230
00:21:08 --> 00:21:13
different components in the food web.
So now we're going to more

231
00:21:13 --> 00:21:17
analytically look at the flow of
carbon.  And when we talk about

232
00:21:17 --> 00:21:22
carbon we are also talking about
energy, right?

233
00:21:22 --> 00:21:26
Carbon and energy are the same
thing.  I mean they're

234
00:21:26 --> 00:21:31
interconvertable.
So we're going to look at the flow

235
00:21:31 --> 00:21:37
of carbon from the phytoplankton to
the zooplankton through that trophic

236
00:21:37 --> 00:21:43
level.  And to do this we have to
talk about some definitions.

237
00:21:43 --> 00:21:48
And again this is in your handout
so I'm not going to write all this

238
00:21:48 --> 00:21:54
on the board but we'll just walk
through this.  The flow of carbon or

239
00:21:54 --> 00:22:00
energy through a trophic level,
which is one of these links, OK?

240
00:22:00 --> 00:22:04
This is one trophic level.
This is the next trophic level.

241
00:22:04 --> 00:22:09
Or you can also think of this as an
organism.  This type of analysis

242
00:22:09 --> 00:22:14
applies to both.
And we start out with the

243
00:22:14 --> 00:22:19
productivity at trophic level and
minus one, OK?

244
00:22:19 --> 00:22:24
And so the first would be primary
productivity coming into the system.

245
00:22:24 --> 00:22:29
Some of that productivity, some of
that carbon is not ingested by the

246
00:22:29 --> 00:22:34
next trophic level.
That's lost as dead organic matter,

247
00:22:34 --> 00:22:40
detritus, whatever we want to call
it.  So that's D sub n the portion

248
00:22:40 --> 00:22:45
not consumed.  Then some of it is
ingested by the organism,

249
00:22:45 --> 00:22:51
I sub n.  And then some fraction of
that is assimilated by the organism.

250
00:22:51 --> 00:22:57
That means it's taken into its
biochemistry and goes toward

251
00:22:57 --> 00:23:02
building biomass.
And some of it is lost as fecal

252
00:23:02 --> 00:23:07
matter produced,
that's F sub n.  And urine would

253
00:23:07 --> 00:23:12
also be a part of this,
waste products.  And then some of it

254
00:23:12 --> 00:23:17
is then, the rest of it is then
available, oh,

255
00:23:17 --> 00:23:22
some of it, this is important,
is lost as respiration.  And then

256
00:23:22 --> 00:23:27
the rest is available as
productivity for the next

257
00:23:27 --> 00:23:32
trophic level.  OK.
So different types of organisms.

258
00:23:32 --> 00:23:38
First, before we get to that, using
this analysis we can start to define

259
00:23:38 --> 00:23:44
efficiencies of energy conversion
through this system.

260
00:23:44 --> 00:23:49
And this is because different types
of organisms assimilate carbon with

261
00:23:49 --> 00:23:55
different efficiencies.
And that is important in the flow

262
00:23:55 --> 00:24:01
of carbon through different
types of ecosystems.

263
00:24:01 --> 00:24:05
So let's look at the first
efficiency that would be I,

264
00:24:05 --> 00:24:10
ingested, reflecting the amount
that's ingested relative to the

265
00:24:10 --> 00:24:14
amount that's available.
And this is called the exploitation

266
00:24:14 --> 00:24:19
efficiency, OK?
I sub n divided by P sub n minus

267
00:24:19 --> 00:24:24
one.  The next one similarly would
be A sub n, the amount that's

268
00:24:24 --> 00:24:29
assimilated relative to the amount
that's ingested.

269
00:24:29 --> 00:24:34
And that is the assimilation
efficiency.  And finally the amount

270
00:24:34 --> 00:24:40
that goes to the next trophic level
divided by the amount that's

271
00:24:40 --> 00:24:45
assimilated, which is the production
efficiency, the amount that actually

272
00:24:45 --> 00:24:51
goes to productivity that is
assimilated.  And these all

273
00:24:51 --> 00:24:57
multiplied together give you the
ecological efficiency.

274
00:24:57 --> 00:25:03
And that is sometimes called the
trophic transfer efficiency.

275
00:25:03 --> 00:25:09
That's the amount of carbon that is
basically lost as you go through one

276
00:25:09 --> 00:25:15
trophic level.
And usually, and we'll talk about

277
00:25:15 --> 00:25:21
this in a minute,
this is 10% to 20% actually makes it

278
00:25:21 --> 00:25:27
through the system,
and the rest is lost to respiration

279
00:25:27 --> 00:25:34
or detritus or fecal matter.
OK, so let's talk about now how

280
00:25:34 --> 00:25:42
different organisms vary in terms of
efficiencies.

281
00:25:42 --> 00:25:50
We have, in terms of the

282
00:25:50 --> 00:25:58
exploitation efficiency,
if you're talking about, for example,

283
00:25:58 --> 00:26:06
tree insects.
So insects feeding on trees is about

284
00:26:06 --> 00:26:15
1% to 10%.  They don't take that
much of the tree.

285
00:26:15 --> 00:26:24
If it's grass to animals it's more
like 20%.  And if it's phytoplankton

286
00:26:24 --> 00:26:33
to zooplankton it's more
like 20% to 40%.

287
00:26:33 --> 00:26:37
In other words,
zooplankton harvests much of the

288
00:26:37 --> 00:26:41
primary productivity,
no, almost half of the productivity

289
00:26:41 --> 00:26:45
that the phytoplankton have made.
OK.  What about assimilation

290
00:26:45 --> 00:26:50
efficiency?  How does this vary
between organisms?

291
00:26:50 --> 00:26:54
Well, this one, you can think about
it as if you eat food that is,

292
00:26:54 --> 00:26:58
I was going to say not you, but it
is true, we are all animals so it

293
00:26:58 --> 00:27:04
applies to us, too.
If you eat food that is similar in

294
00:27:04 --> 00:27:10
composition to your own bodily
composition you're more efficient at

295
00:27:10 --> 00:27:16
assimilating it because you don't
have to break it down as much and

296
00:27:16 --> 00:27:22
reorganize it.
So herbivores,

297
00:27:22 --> 00:27:28
organisms that eat plant matter are
20% to 50% efficient in

298
00:27:28 --> 00:27:34
their assimilation.
But carnivores is more like 80%.

299
00:27:34 --> 00:27:41
Because you are meat and if you eat
meat you don't have as much waste

300
00:27:41 --> 00:27:49
than if you eat a lot of fiber.
So there are big differences there.

301
00:27:49 --> 00:27:56
And then in terms of, that is not a
value judgment on whether you should

302
00:27:56 --> 00:28:03
eat meat or not.
I just want to make that very clear.

303
00:28:03 --> 00:28:09
What?  OK.  But later on we'll talk
about the difference between eating

304
00:28:09 --> 00:28:15
meat globally and being vegetarians
in terms of utilizing primary

305
00:28:15 --> 00:28:21
productivity on the earth.
But in terms of production

306
00:28:21 --> 00:28:27
efficiency you have warm-blooded
organisms having a 2% production

307
00:28:27 --> 00:28:35
efficiency.
Whereas cold-blooded have a 40%

308
00:28:35 --> 00:28:45
production efficiency.
Why would that be?

309
00:28:45 --> 00:28:52
Yes.  If you're warm-blooded,

310
00:28:52 --> 00:28:57
does anybody know the technical term
for that?  It is if you

311
00:28:57 --> 00:29:02
are homeotherm.
Or what did you say?

312
00:29:02 --> 00:29:08
Endothermic.  I'm not sure.
I think that's chemistry.  It

313
00:29:08 --> 00:29:13
sounded good, though.
So there are homeotherms and

314
00:29:13 --> 00:29:19
heterotherms.  It doesn't matter.
The point is that these have to

315
00:29:19 --> 00:29:24
maintain their body temperature like
we do.  That takes a lot of energy.

316
00:29:24 --> 00:29:30
Whereas, these go with the flow so
to speak, that technical term.

317
00:29:30 --> 00:29:36
But that doesn't take as much energy.
If it's cold they just let their

318
00:29:36 --> 00:29:42
body get cold.
They don't burn,

319
00:29:42 --> 00:29:48
burn, burn to keep the temperature
constant.  OK,

320
00:29:48 --> 00:29:54
so that's how organisms differ.
Now let's move on to the next

321
00:29:54 --> 00:30:00
chapter in which now we are
going to look at --

322
00:30:00 --> 00:30:04
We were looking at the flow through
one trophic level.

323
00:30:04 --> 00:30:09
Now we're going to connect a whole
bunch of trophic levels.

324
00:30:09 --> 00:30:13
We're going to look at the flow of
energy through this component of

325
00:30:13 --> 00:30:18
this food web and do a more thorough
analysis.  OK,

326
00:30:18 --> 00:30:23
so this gets kind of messy but let's
start here.  I better use the

327
00:30:23 --> 00:30:27
powerful one.  OK,
so each one of these is what we call

328
00:30:27 --> 00:30:32
a trophic level.
And these are the primary producers,

329
00:30:32 --> 00:30:37
the photosynthetic organisms.  Here
is our gross primary production

330
00:30:37 --> 00:30:42
absorbing sunlight.
Some of that is lost to heat.

331
00:30:42 --> 00:30:46
Some of that is lost to respiration.
Here is our little R sub A,

332
00:30:46 --> 00:30:51
remember?  Right here.  And some of
it, the net primary productivity is

333
00:30:51 --> 00:30:56
available for ingestion at the next
trophic level which are

334
00:30:56 --> 00:31:01
the herbivores.
So all we're doing here is ganging

335
00:31:01 --> 00:31:06
up a whole bunch of those individual
analyses.  And then the next trophic

336
00:31:06 --> 00:31:11
levels are the carnivores and then
the second carnivores.

337
00:31:11 --> 00:31:15
And the number of links you have
here is something that is obviously

338
00:31:15 --> 00:31:20
determined by the efficiency of
transfer from one to another and the

339
00:31:20 --> 00:31:25
total amount of energy that comes
into the system.

340
00:31:25 --> 00:31:30
So here in our ecosystem we have
carbon being lost at each

341
00:31:30 --> 00:31:35
step to detritus.
And you have feces at each link.

342
00:31:35 --> 00:31:39
This all goes down and becomes part
of the detritus food web.

343
00:31:39 --> 00:31:44
And in that you have two forms of
carbon.  You have particulate

344
00:31:44 --> 00:31:48
organic carbon which is pieces of
dead carbon floating around,

345
00:31:48 --> 00:31:53
dead leaves, dead phytoplankton,
whatever.  And then you also have

346
00:31:53 --> 00:31:57
dissolved organic carbon.
When these plants die and the

347
00:31:57 --> 00:32:02
phytoplankton die they burst open.
And the glucose and amino acids and

348
00:32:02 --> 00:32:06
all of that dissolve into the water
in the system.

349
00:32:06 --> 00:32:10
And that becomes dissolved organic
carbon which is available for this

350
00:32:10 --> 00:32:14
microbial food web,
an entirely different food web

351
00:32:14 --> 00:32:18
that's coupled to the system.
So you have the detritivore.  This

352
00:32:18 --> 00:32:22
the grazing food web here.
The waste from that goes to the

353
00:32:22 --> 00:32:26
detritivores and the microbes.
And then whatever is left over

354
00:32:26 --> 00:32:30
after that is called refractory
carbon.

355
00:32:30 --> 00:32:36
That means none of the creatures are
able to break it open and really get

356
00:32:36 --> 00:32:42
energy out of it.
And in the big picture what is this?

357
00:32:42 --> 00:32:48
We talked about it actually last
time.  Fossil fuel,

358
00:32:48 --> 00:32:54
exactly.  This is the carbon that
actually accumulates over time that

359
00:32:54 --> 00:33:00
when ecosystems are finished
processing all of the

360
00:33:00 --> 00:33:07
primary production.
OK, so I'm trying to time this right

361
00:33:07 --> 00:33:15
so that we make sure we have time
for the movie.

362
00:33:15 --> 00:33:24
So let's look at a couple of ways
we can think about this.

363
00:33:24 --> 00:33:31
Let's just compare.
If we look at the open ocean

364
00:33:31 --> 00:33:36
ecosystem versus the
tropical forest.

365
00:33:36 --> 00:33:46
And the average,

366
00:33:46 --> 00:33:56
oh, I forgot one thing.
OK.  If we take now the gross

367
00:33:56 --> 00:34:03
primary productivity.
And I'm going to circle all of the

368
00:34:03 --> 00:34:09
respirations.  See the purple here?
So this is all the carbon that's

369
00:34:09 --> 00:34:15
being fixed.  This is that is lost
to respiration.

370
00:34:15 --> 00:34:21
And we can define a new parameter
which is net ecosystem production.

371
00:34:21 --> 00:34:27
And that is gross primary
production minus the respiration of

372
00:34:27 --> 00:34:33
all of the autotrophies,
R sub A, minus the respiration of

373
00:34:33 --> 00:34:39
all of the heterotrophic components
of the system.

374
00:34:39 --> 00:34:45
So that would be the herbivores,
carnivores, detritivores,

375
00:34:45 --> 00:34:51
microorganisms.
That's all the carbon that's

376
00:34:51 --> 00:34:58
respired and lost to CO2.
So you can add this to this.

377
00:34:58 --> 00:35:05
So we'd have net ecosystem
production.  Production equals GPP

378
00:35:05 --> 00:35:12
minus RA minus the sum of all the
heterotrophs.  Now,

379
00:35:12 --> 00:35:19
in very mature ecosystems this net
ecosystem production is essentially

380
00:35:19 --> 00:35:26
nothing.  All right?
Everything that's produced is

381
00:35:26 --> 00:35:32
consumed.
For example, in a tropical

382
00:35:32 --> 00:35:36
rainforest you don't have a huge
buildup of organic carbon in a

383
00:35:36 --> 00:35:41
tropical rainforest.
Everything that's produced is

384
00:35:41 --> 00:35:46
basically consumed and this is zero.
But in a young forest, say a

385
00:35:46 --> 00:35:50
plantation at the extreme where you
plant trees and they're increasing

386
00:35:50 --> 00:35:55
in biomass, then obviously this net
ecosystem production is a positive

387
00:35:55 --> 00:36:00
number.  What if net ecosystem
production is a negative number?

388
00:36:00 --> 00:36:09
It won't be there for long,

389
00:36:09 --> 00:36:15
right?  You've got to have things
photosynthesizing net at least

390
00:36:15 --> 00:36:21
enough to maintain the ecosystem.
I mean you can have it for a

391
00:36:21 --> 00:36:27
transient for not any steady state.
OK.  All right.  Talking about

392
00:36:27 --> 00:36:33
ecological efficiencies again.
If we talk about the average --

393
00:36:33 --> 00:36:43
The average ecological efficiency of

394
00:36:43 --> 00:36:51
the open ocean is about 25% and of
the tropical rain forest is about 5%.

395
00:36:51 --> 00:36:59
So the average number of trophic
levels, that's basically the number

396
00:36:59 --> 00:37:08
of links in the food web in these
two systems is about 7.1 and 3.2.

397
00:37:08 --> 00:37:14
In other words,
when you have more efficiency of

398
00:37:14 --> 00:37:21
transfer from one link to another
you can have more links obviously.

399
00:37:21 --> 00:37:28
So getting back to humans again,
and this gets back to in terms of

400
00:37:28 --> 00:37:35
what we might think about as a
global human society.

401
00:37:35 --> 00:37:49
If you go from wheat to man you lose
90% of the energy in that transfer.

402
00:37:49 --> 00:38:03
If you go from wheat to cows to man
you lose 90% here and

403
00:38:03 --> 00:38:12
you lose 90% here.
So obviously in terms of feeding the

404
00:38:12 --> 00:38:17
world it's much better to go
directly from wheat to humans than

405
00:38:17 --> 00:38:21
to go from wheat to cows to humans.
You all know this but it's

406
00:38:21 --> 00:38:26
important to remember that.
And unfortunately the trend in the

407
00:38:26 --> 00:38:31
world is to go more from here to
here instead of the

408
00:38:31 --> 00:38:36
other way around.
Just something to remember in terms

409
00:38:36 --> 00:38:41
of the application of this knowledge.
OK.  Finally very quickly I'm going

410
00:38:41 --> 00:38:46
to skip over this and go to another
way to look at what we've been

411
00:38:46 --> 00:38:51
talking about.
It's just another diagram of the

412
00:38:51 --> 00:38:56
same thing.  You have the
photosynthetic organisms that the

413
00:38:56 --> 00:39:02
entire world depends on,
this productivity for food and fiber.

414
00:39:02 --> 00:39:06
And that most of that is lost
through respiration and the rest

415
00:39:06 --> 00:39:10
goes to the other organisms
including detritivores.

416
00:39:10 --> 00:39:15
So a big question is how much of
this global primary productivity,

417
00:39:15 --> 00:39:19
this global photosynthesis have
humans taken over?

418
00:39:19 --> 00:39:23
It's really hard to answer that
question, OK, but a lot of

419
00:39:23 --> 00:39:28
ecologists have been working very
hard at understanding the fraction

420
00:39:28 --> 00:39:32
of global photosynthesis that has
been what's called co-opted

421
00:39:32 --> 00:39:38
by humans.
And the estimates range from 10% to

422
00:39:38 --> 00:39:44
55%.  The amount that we use
directly as food or fuel or fiber or

423
00:39:44 --> 00:39:50
timber is not that great,
but there's a lot of productivity

424
00:39:50 --> 00:39:56
that's diverted as crop waste,
burning, et cetera.  And land

425
00:39:56 --> 00:40:03
conversion obviously uses up a lot
of habitat and productivity.

426
00:40:03 --> 00:40:06
So the significant point here is
that as we co-opt this primary

427
00:40:06 --> 00:40:10
productivity we change dramatically
all of the food webs that rely on it,

428
00:40:10 --> 00:40:14
and that is what is part of the path
to extinction of a lot of species.

429
00:40:14 --> 00:40:18
And the big question is how much
can we co-opt?

430
00:40:18 --> 00:40:22
I mean we're on the road to taking
over the primary productivity of the

431
00:40:22 --> 00:40:26
earth, there's no question,
completely.  Unless we set up

432
00:40:26 --> 00:40:30
reserves that's it, that's
where we're marching.

433
00:40:30 --> 00:40:34
Now, when we're in charge of it,
is it going to function the way we

434
00:40:34 --> 00:40:38
need it to function to maintain our
atmosphere and to provide us with

435
00:40:38 --> 00:40:42
the food and fiber that we need?
That's still an open question.  OK,

436
00:40:42 --> 00:40:46
so now I'm going to show you this
really neat DVD because these

437
00:40:46 --> 00:40:50
pictures of food webs are deadly
dull and don't represent anything at

438
00:40:50 --> 00:40:54
all of what the reality is like.
So I'm going to show you three

439
00:40:54 --> 00:40:58
weeks in the life of
a real food web.

440
00:40:58 --> 00:41:02
And I want you to think about two
things when you're watching it.

441
00:41:02 --> 00:41:06
Don't just think you're at home in
front of your TV watching a nature

442
00:41:06 --> 00:41:10
show and going brain dead or
something.  Think about what you've

443
00:41:10 --> 00:41:14
learned in this class.
So think about the gigatons of

444
00:41:14 --> 00:41:18
carbon that are flowing through this
system.  More importantly this

445
00:41:18 --> 00:41:22
entire food web and everything
that's going on in it is

446
00:41:22 --> 00:41:26
orchestrated by the information in
the genes of the organisms

447
00:41:26 --> 00:41:30
in the food web.
That's the information content that

448
00:41:30 --> 00:41:34
structures this whole thing.
And how it's all orchestrated and

449
00:41:34 --> 00:41:39
coordinated and happens the same way
more or less every year is

450
00:41:39 --> 00:41:43
absolutely mind blowing as far as
I'm concern and a major,

451
00:41:43 --> 00:41:46
major challenge for ecology and for
molecular ecology.  OK.
