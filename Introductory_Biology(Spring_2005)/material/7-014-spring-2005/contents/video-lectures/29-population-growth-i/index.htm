<p></p>
<p>And, we're going to make a major shift. You're going to feel like  this is a whole different class compared to what we were talking about  last time, because were jumping from the biogeochemical cycles, or  looking at the biosphere as essentially a large biochemical machine, to  studying individual populations of organisms, and the communities that  they make up when they come together. So, before we were really talking  about organisms as they function in the biosphere. Mentally, we're  grinding them all up and thinking of them as a collective biochemistry  basically. And now we are going to stop grinding them up, mentally, and  think of them as individual organisms. So, the next series of lectures,  we're going to talk about population ecology. If you remember the first  lecture I gave we talked about the hierarchy of organization within  ecological systems, and then we are going to talk about competition  between organisms with a population, and between organisms of different  species, and were going to talk about predation, and mutualism.</p>
<p>These  are all interactions between organisms that affect the fitness of  organisms. And then we'll, at the end, talk about community structure.  So this is sort of the outline for the rest of my lectures, not for this  lecture. So, today we are going to talk about properties of  populations.</p>
<p>We're going to analyze how we measure growth rate,  growth and death in populations, and this will include populations that  have an age structure, and populations that don't. And this is all in  preparation for the next lecture where we will talk about human  population growth. So, in this field of population ecology, which is as I  told you in the first lecture, and some universities you could take  three courses in population ecology, and you could get a Ph.D. in  population ecology. I mean, this is a whole field that we're going to  cover in two lectures.</p>
<p>But what population ecologists worry about  fundamentally, well, they don't worry about it. This is what they study,  is what regulates the density of populations? Obviously, it's a  function of how fast they're growing, the birth rate, and how fast  they're dying, the death rate. But what are the factors that actually  influence those rates? Is it competition with other organisms? Is it the  entire structure of the community? Is it the availability of food? Is  it the various abiotic properties of the environment: temperature, etc.?  So, they analyze these and basically try to model the population growth  as a function of these various parameters. The other questions they  ask, is how are populations distributed in the environment? Are they  clustered? Are they evenly distributed? This has specific meanings about  their ecology.</p>
<p>And, the other thing that people are really  fascinated by, which is a really tough question, is why are some  species' populations extremely abundant, while others are rare? And one  of the discussions we always have in my lab, we work on an organism  that's extremely abundant, this prochlorococcus, which I told you  briefly about, is the most abundant photosynthetic cell on the planet.  So, my students tend to keep saying why is it so successful? And I keep  saying, it's successful but there are thousands of other species who are  also successful. Abundance does not equal success. Endurance equals  success. If you're here in the next generation, you're successful.</p>
<p>If  you're not, if your species is disappearing, then you're not  successful. So, speaking of abundance, let's talk about how we measure  abundance, population ecologists. And this is just one example.  Obviously, for microorganisms, or some microorganisms it's really easy  because they're tiny relative to their habitats. So for the  prochlorococcus that we work on, there are 10^5 cells per milliliter.  So, we can go take a milliliter of water and measure how many cells  there. But for some organisms, larger ones, that are widely distributed,  it's not that easy. So, one method is mark and recapture. That's used a  lot for things like birds and butterflies. For a bird, the mark would  be putting a band on the bird.</p>
<p>For a butterfly, they often take a  magic marker and put a mark on the wing. Well, that's largely what they  do. You try to mark individuals in some way that would not influence  their survivorship rate. So, if N equals the population size, that is,  that's our unknown, what we're going to do is capture, say, for  butterflies or moths, you use a butterfly net, or moths you can use a  light to track them; for birds, you put up these big mist nets. They fly  into them; they get tangled up a little bit but they don't get hurt.  Then you band them, and that we let them go. That's the way you mark  them. So, we're going to say n1 equals the total number of marked  individuals released.</p>
<p>So you capture them, you mark them, you  release them. n2 is equal to, and then you go out sometime later and you  recapture as many individuals as you can find, and this would be the  total number [SIREN] that doesn't sound like a fire drill, does it? I  assume we're good to go here. So, n2 is the total number of recaptured.  And we're going to say m2 is equal to the numbers recaptured that are  marked. OK, and then we assume that the fraction of the recaptured that  are marked represent the fraction in the total population that was  marked.</p>
<p>So, we say m2 over n2 is equal to n1 over N. And the  number that we're looking for, population size, is equal to n1, n2  divided by m2. So, of course, this assumes that there's no effect of the  marking of the individuals. It assumes that there's no bias in the  trapping for the marked or not marked individuals. There's all kinds of  assumptions that underlie this. It's a start for assessing the  population size.</p>
<p>OK, so how do we measure population growth? We're  going to first start with looking at populations that have age  structure. Now, I hope you printed out the slides that were on the Web,  because I'm depending on these overheads a lot for this lecture because  we wouldn't get through any of it if I wrote all this stuff on the  board. So, we're going to talk about populations that have an age  structure. And the data I'm going to show you here is for human  populations. But this applies to any population that has differential  birth and death rates as a function of the age of the organism, OK? So,  in these populations if birth rate and death rate are high, the  population is dominated by young people.</p>
<p>And, we'll look at this  in a minute. And, if B and D are low, dominated by old people, or older I  should say, since I now fit into the old category. OK, so here's a  typical population age distribution for developed countries, where each  slice here, these are females on the right, males on the left, and each  slice is an age category: zero to 10 years, 10 to 20. And you can see  that in these kinds of populations, you have a fairly even age  distribution.</p>
<p>Long periods of no net growth in a population lead  to this. In these developed countries, and we're going to examine why  this is, there's basically an even replacement rate of children for  adults. And one of the things we worry about when you see this kind of  age distribution, although it's good in terms of population growth, is  when you have few young people and a lot of older people, who's going to  take care of them, which is what's behind the Social Security crisis.  But we won't get into that.</p>
<p>Since you're the young people and I'm  the old people, I don't want to dwell on that. OK, so what demographers  do for human populations is project what the population will look like  in the future based on the reproductive rates of the present. And you  can see for the US here, it's reasonably stable if you look at these  three snapshots. We're going to go backwards starting with 1950, and  show you what the population has been doing since 1950. And I'm just  going to walk through this. You only have one in your handouts, but I'll  show you how it's moving along. Moving along, you can think of this as  generations moving through the population.</p>
<p>And this is the date up  here. So, this is 1950, 1955, you can see this red cohort. A cohort is a  group of individuals that were born at roughly the same time. So, you  can see that red cohort there. And we are going along, 1965. This lip  here, that we can now see, is the postwar baby boom. That's what I'm a  member of. If you can see it in this bulge in this population. And now  were marching along. Here's my cohort, and I just put these lines on to  keep you oriented. And here comes you guys. I think those are you guys,  1985. That's roughly right, because I never know when I've last updated  these slides. So, and here you go.</p>
<p>See, here's the big bulge of  all of these baby boomers that you guys are going to have to take care  of. And now, we can actually see an echo. This is what's called the baby  boom echo. These are the kids of the baby boomers, which is you guys.  But you can only see that as we march through it. So, here we are at  2020. But you get the impression that it's a fairly stable, now, even  age distribution in the US and these developed countries. Oops, here we  go a little but more. Sorry. 2035, 2045, OK. Now, in less developed  countries, the birth rate's high and the death rate's low.</p>
<p>We see a  much different age distribution. And here's Uganda, with a very high  reproductive rate showing the projections to 2050. And here, we can  march through from 1970. You can see that this huge expansion, do you  know what that noise is? OK. Does anybody have a hypothesis for what  that noise is that we could test? Oh, OK, I guess we can't do anything  about that.</p>
<p>OK, so here's Uganda. And you can see the dramatic  difference in a population where there is large birthrates, and reducing  death rates. And we're going to get into analyzing that in the next  lecture. I just want to show you this here so you have a feeling for  what we are talking about in age structured populations. So, let's now  look at how are going to analyze these populations to try to quantify  growth rates or replacement rates. And to do this, we set up life  tables. And this is basically what insurance agencies do for human  populations. But we do the same thing for populations of ecological  interests. We use the same techniques. In this lecture, going to use a  unicorn is my example, because I can make up the numbers because they  don't exist.</p>
<p>But in a textbook there are examples for real  organisms like lizards and things like that. OK, so we need to define an  age interval, X, and then this is the number of intervals in the  original cohort. Again, a cohort is a group of individuals that are born  within a defined age interval. I mean, I think of you guys as a cohort.</p>
<p>DX  is the number dying during that interval. All of this is on the Web.  These slides are on the Web. So, you don't need to write it down, but  you can. And, NX is that number of individuals surviving to age X. LX is  the portion of individuals surviving to age X. So, that's just equal to  NX divided by N0. And, we're going to look at a table that shows this  in a minute. And MX is something that's measured. It's the per capita  births during age interval X to X plus one. And this is also called  age-specific fecundity. And you can think of it as the number of female  offspring produced per female in a particular age category. OK, is  everybody comfortable with that? So, with these definitions, we're going  to build a life table that will allow us to actually calculate some  things of interest.</p>
<p>And, what do we want to calculate? We want to  calculate the survivorship probability, LX. We want to calculate the net  replacement rate. No it's not really a rate, net replacement of  population per generation, which we are calling R0. It's basically the  number of children people have to replace who's there per generation.  And then, for now, this is what we are going to look at. And to do that,  we are going to generate what's called a cohort life table.</p>
<p>And  to do this, we follow a cohort of individuals throughout lifetime. Or,  we can also generate a static life table because it's not that easy  sometimes to have a group of organisms that are born at the same time to  follow them throughout their entire lifetime. So there is a static life  table of taking a snapshot at one time of the population, and  calculating the age structure. So, you take a snapshot, and we look at  the age structure. And, we are going to do this in a second so it will  make more sense. OK, so we've defined our terms. And now, we are going  to start by calculating LX.</p>
<p>So, this is a cohort life table for  unicorns. We're going to start out with a hundred baby unicorns that we  have in our imaginary unicorn pen. So, this is a cohort size of 100.  And, we find that after a year there are 50 of them left. 50 of them die  in the first year. So, the probability here, the proportion surviving  is 0.5, NX over N0, and then a year later, .4, .3, and then by four  years older, no unicorns left. They don't live very long. All right, so  this is what's called the survivorship probability, and what we can do  is look at there. Different types of organisms have different, what we  call, survivorship curves.</p>
<p>And this is discussed in your textbook.  We'll just describe the extremes. These are just theoretical  survivorship curves. But some organisms have a very high probability of  survival as a function of age until they reach an old age. And then,  they have a very low probability of survival. There are other organisms  whose survivorship probability drops very fast, right after they're  born. But if they make it through that interval, they're pretty good to  go. And then there are some that have a steady probability of dying. So,  where are humans, do you think, on this? Two? No, but that's OK.</p>
<p>Let  me ask you the other way; where our frogs, do you think? Yeah, OK, so  you got that image. Tons of frogs' eggs: everybody eats them. Or for  that matter, the video I showed towards the end of the last class where  there were all those eggs of, what was that? Remember all those eggs  that everybody was eating? Herring, thank you. So, any organism that  puts out just tons of fertilized eggs, and knowing that most of them  will be eaten, but some of them will survive, falls here. And, humans  actually fall here.</p>
<p>Any organism that has a high investment in the  care of offspring, they have few offspring but they invest a lot into  the care of those offspring, would fall here. And then this, actually  birds and things fall here. So, here's some real but idealized  survivorship curves. These are humans. And males and females are  different. I'm not sure whether we understand that completely yet. Does  anybody know whether that's socially constructed? Now that there's more  women experiencing equal stress in the workplace as there are men that  will probably even out. But, I think there are more women born, or girl  babies. Anyway, there's some interesting biology behind this, but I  don't know. I don't remember.</p>
<p>And, here's grass, of course grass  spew out all these seeds everywhere, and very few of them survive, also  these frogs, etc. and birds are commonly like this, where they're  somewhere in between. Why do we care so much about survivorship curves?  Who cares? Well, I mean they're inherently interesting to population  ecologists, but there are also uses for them. For example, if you want  to conserve a species, if you're worried about a species going extinct,  you want to figure out whether it's better to conserve the young ones or  the old ones. For example, turtle species, you would pick a certain age  group where the probability of survival is high, and decide to target  the conservation of that age group. So, let's continue with, we are  building our life table here.</p>
<p>So, we have the survivorship  probability, but what we really want to get at is understanding whether  or not the population that we are describing is replacing itself with  each generation. So, maybe we should define, when R0 is equal to one,  that meets the population is exactly replacing itself. So, this is  replacing, so the actual growth rate of the population would be steady.  If R0 is less than one, the number of individuals is declining. And R0  of greater than one, it's increasing.</p>
<p>So, we want to know for our  unicorns what that is. And to get to that, we have to know something  about the birth rates. So, MX is the average offspring per female of age  X. So, this is called the age-specific fecundity. And that's something  that's a known property of the population. Whoops, oh, my, my, my, my,  I'm missing a slide. Oh, there we go. They're out of order. OK, so we  have MX. So, how do we calculate R0? Well, R0 is the sum of LX MX. With  the sum of the survivorship times the age-specific fecundity, and in  this case, it sums up to three.</p>
<p>So, what's happening to our  unicorn population? It's growing. Yeah, we are getting three unicorns in  each generation for every one that existed before. So, in our imaginary  unit of our population, we're going to be knee deep in unicorns pretty  fast. OK, so I forgot my watch, so I have to look at my computer. What  if we can't follow cohort? Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>How do we create the  same kind of analysis for a population that we can't follow through  time, but can only look at as a snapshot? OK, this is where we go to the  slide. If you don't have it in your handout, it doesn't matter. I just  got off the web this morning. I couldn't find a skeleton of the unicorn  because, of course, that's totally imaginary, but I found a mastodon.  So, just imagine that this is a unicorn, and I couldn't find a unicorn  horn, so this is a sheep's. But, all these principles apply. I just  discovered Images in Google, which is really exciting. So, you're going  to get subjected to this for awhile. So, OK, so what you can do, and  this has actually been done with mountain sheep, is you go out you find  dead sheep, you find skeletons of sheep that have died for whatever  causes.</p>
<p>And you go out, and you sample until you have, say, 100  skeletons. And that's your cohort that you're looking at, at one point  in time. And from their horn, you can actually tell how old they were  when they died. You can count the number of rings, so that's what's  here, annual horn rings.</p>
<p>This is for a dall mountain sheep. So,  you can say well now it died when it was two. That one died when it was  10. That one died when it was whatever age. And then you can create the  same kind of life table, a static life table, where you have a hundred  skeletons. That is your cohort. You look at the number dying of age zero  to one, the number of one year olds, the number that died when they  were one year old, the number that died when they were a two-year-old  etc. And so, from these data, these are the data that you collected, you  can calculate this column, NX, so NX is DX, or NX minus DX equals NX  plus one. Does that make sense? I can never tell whether. I know if I  write this on the board it might be easier, but it's so obvious isn't  it? We are just saying that this is the number that died at the age.</p>
<p>This  is the number you started with, so that's how many are going to have  that age, that age, and that age. And then, once you have this column,  your proportion surviving LX, you can calculate LX. LX equals NX divided  by N0, OK? So, we are doing exactly the same thing as we did before.  It's just that we're getting the NX column instead of getting it by  following the cohort. We're getting it by calculating it based on how  old dead organisms were when they died. And in my ecology class that I  teach, some years we actually go out to the Mount Auburn Cemetery. And  you can do this from human gravestones.</p>
<p>You can go to the  cemetery, and pick out a number of gravestones, and see the age at which  humans died. You create yourself a cohort, and you can create a life  table. And you can do that for different eras, and see how replacements  have changed. OK, now so that's the analysis for populations that have  an age structure. Now we are going to go more into simpler type of  population, and that is a population with a stable age distribution. And  to do this, you're going to help me, and we're going to use your  calculus that you've all been studying.</p>
<p>So, instead of the unicorn  now, have your imaginary population be a population of microbes that  divide in half. They multiplied by dividing in half. So, each one of  these is a microbe that's dividing in half. This is your mental image.  This is what's called exponential growth. It's obvious how that happens.  And we're going to model this population, we're going to first assume  unlimited resources. OK, so we're going to say that the rate of  population increase is equal to the average birth rate minus the average  death rate times the number of cells.</p>
<p>OK, so we are going to now  turn this into math, and that is to say the dN/dt, the increase in  population where N is the population number is equal to the birth rate  minus the death rate times N which is the number of cells, OK? And then,  we're going to let B minus D, the birth rate minus the death rate, be  what we call r. And, this is what's called the intrinsic rate of  increase of a population.</p>
<p>OK, what are the units of r? One over  time, exactly, time to the minus one. So, let's look at that more  carefully. And also, it's a little misleading to say it's the rate of  increase because r can be positive or negative, however it turns out. It  can be positive or negative, but that's what it's called. So, we have  the dN/dt equals rN. We're substituting r in this equation for one over N  times dN/dt equals r. OK, so ours has the unit time to the minus one.</p>
<p>And  so, let's ask a question. Given N0 I give you the population density at  some time which we're going to call T equals zero. Given a population  growing according to this, which is exponential growth, what if we want  to know the population, what N is at any time T? We want an equation  that will give us, given N0 what would the population density be at some  time, T? What do you have to do to this to get that? Yeah, so who wants  to do that for me? Come on.</p>
<p>You guys did this freshman year. It's  the easiest thing there is, right? Every class I've had has had  somebody who was willing to come up and do this. OK, so we'll just add a  T there. So, N at sometime T is equally to N0 e to the rT. And so, We  could say, then, r equals natural log of NT minus natural log of N0  divided by T. And I like to write it that way because then, we know what  this looks like, right? Let's plot that. This is N and this is T. What  does that look like? I know this is really rudimentary but remember  we're modeling population growth.</p>
<p>So here, if we plot the log of  N, and this is what we do with cultures of microorganisms. That's a  flask. Those are a lot of microbes in there. And what we do is we sample  it at various points in time, and if you take the log we get a nice  straight line that we can draw a regression through. And what's the  slope of that line equal to? r. Exactly. The growth rate in the units: N  to the minus one. OK, what's the Y intercept? N0.</p>
<p>OK, now suppose  we want to calculate the doubling time of the population, the time it  takes to double. How would we do that? Let's first define it. It's the  time, T, that it takes for NT to equal to N0, right? If we start with N0  the population doubles. Then, that's the time at NT. So, we want to  solve for that T for the time it takes for the population to double.  Since natural log of NT over N0 equals rT, then the natural log of,  sorry, 2N0 over N0 equals rT, and T equals the natural log of two  divided by r equals our doubling time.</p>
<p>Does that make sense? I'll  put this out there so you can see it better. What's the natural log of  two? 0.69, thank you, always a handy thing to have in our repertoire.  So, that's just the way, it's easier to think about the time it takes  for a population to double often, then the instantaneous growth rate.</p>
