***** Course Highlights *****
This course features a complete set of video_lectures by Professor Graham
Walker, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) professor and director of the
HHMI Education group at MIT, and Professor Sallie W. Chisholm, Lee and
Geraldine Martin Professor of Environmental Studies and co-director of the MIT
Earth_Systems_Initiative.
Education development efforts for these introductory biology courses are one of
many activities conducted by the HHMI_Education_Group at MIT. This group
focuses on curriculum development work for creating teaching tools in
undergraduate biology courses.
***** Course Description *****
The MIT Biology Department core courses, 7.012, 7.013, and 7.014, all cover the
same core material, which includes the fundamental principles of biochemistry,
genetics, molecular biology, and cell biology. Biological function at the
molecular level is particularly emphasized and covers the structure and
regulation of genes, as well as, the structure and synthesis of proteins, how
these molecules are integrated into cells, and how these cells are integrated
into multicellular systems and organisms. In addition, each version of the
subject has its own distinctive material.
7.014 focuses on the application of these fundamental principles, toward an
understanding of microorganisms as geochemical agents responsible for the
evolution and renewal of the biosphere and of their role in human health and
disease.
***** Acknowledgements *****
The study materials, problem sets, and quiz materials used during Spring 2005
for 7.014 include contributions from past instructors, teaching assistants, and
other members of the MIT Biology Department affiliated with course 7.014. Since
the following works have evolved over a period of many years, no single source
can be attributed.
***** OCW Scholar Version *****
OCW Scholar courses are designed for self-paced study with no registration
required. They are substantially more complete than typical OCW courses,
blending new online content with material used in MIT classes.
