Please print out this problem set and record your answers on the printed copy. 

Problem sets will not be accepted late. 

Question 1 

You have discovered a new virus that contains only RNA as its genetic material. Curious as to 
how this virus works, you infect cells with this virus and discover that after infection, some 
DNA that encodes viral proteins is produced  At a later time point, lots of  viral RNA 
molecules and various viral proteins are produced. 

a) Explain what type of virus you have discovered. 

b) Outline the steps of the information flow for this virus by filling in the blanks below.  Each 
arrow represents an activity foe example, DNA polymerse.  Circle the arrow that represents a 
activity that the host cell would not have. 

RNA 

c) There is a human gene that encodes a protein identical to one of the proteins produced by 
the virus. When you take the mRNA for this protein and base-pair it with its complementary 
single-strand human DNA and viral RNA, you're surprised to find that they look different by 
electron microscopy.

ii) Why does the human DNA + mRNA schematic has the shape it does?

Question 3 

A scientist has discovered a bacterium that can metabolize alcohol to pyruvate when 
stimulated by the presence of ethanol. Hoping to use this bacteria to eliminate the harmful 
effects of excessive alcohol consumption, he finds that this bacterium produces the enzymes C 
and D which catalyze the ethanol � pyruvate reactions.  The genes for enzymes C and D are 
part of an operon as diagrammed below. 

PY 

Y 

P 
CD 

O 

C 

D 

a) You find two mutants, mutant 1 and mutant 2 that each carry a loss-of-function mutation in 
one of the components of the operon.  These mutants constitutively produce enzymes C and D. 
Given this information, Is Y an activator or repressor? Explain. 

You want to determine what component is missing in each of the mutants.  You examine 
production of enzymes C and D in wild-type, mutant 1 and mutant 2 in the presence and 
absence of ethanol.  You also create partial diploids and measure production of the enzymes.

Question 4 

a) The genes needed to synthesize tryptophan are found in the trp operon.  The presence of 
tryptophan controls the transciption of these genes. 

i) Assume that the regulatory protein for this operon is a repressor.  When do you 
expect the repressor to be associated with the operator? Cirlce one. 

When tryptophan concentration is low. 

When tryptophan concentration is high. 

Explain your choice. 

ii) Assume that the regulatory protein for this operon is an activator.  When do you 
expect the activator to be associated with the operator? Cirlce one. 

When tryptophan concentration is low. 

When tryptophan concentration is high. 

Explain your choice. 

By using bacterial genetics you want to identify the enzymes involved in the tryptophan 
pathway by isolating bacteria that failed to synthesize tryptophan (these bacteria are referred 
to as “trp-”).  You know that mutant bacteria that fail to synthesize tryptophan (and thus can 
not grow without addition of tryptophan) are likely to be defective in one of the enzymes 
involved in the tryptophan synthesis pathway.  You start with a population of wild-type 
(“trp+”) bacteria, mutagenize it with UV light and allow the bacteria to grow into isolated 
colonies on plate A (see diagram).  You then use the replica plating technique to transfer some 
bacteria from each colony onto plates B, C, and D.  The contents of the growth medium are 
listed below each plate.  Complete medium contains all nutrients; minimal medium contains 
nutrients sufficient to allow wild-type bacteria to grow, but bacterial cells with mutations in a 
gene for any nutrient synthesis pathway cannot grow unless the nutrient is added to the 
growth medium.

c) Some colonies do not grow on Plate C.  Give one possible explanation for the growth 
behavior of these colonies. 

d) You repeat this experiment several more times and isolate eight trp- mutants.  You then 
perform a complementation test on these mutants.  The data is shown below.  Briefly describe 
how a complementation test is performed. 

Complementation Test Results: 
In the table below, a (+) indicates growth on minimal media, a (-) indicates lack of growth on 
minimal media.
