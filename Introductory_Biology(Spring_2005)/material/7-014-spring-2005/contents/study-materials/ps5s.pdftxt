Question 2 

Your ongoing interest in bioluminescent organisms has lead you to study the Hawaiian squid, 
Euprymna scolopes.  Most nocturnal creatures cast shadows under the bright Hawaiian 
moonlight, and are easy prey to predatory fish.  This type of squid can shine light downwards 
to match the moonlight and avoid casting a shadow thereby decreasing predation. 

To provide squid for your studies, you maintain a large, self-supporting squid tank.  The food 
web of the tank is shown below.

squid 

phytoplankton 

detritivores 

When your tank is at steady state, you can harvest 10 kg of squid carbon/week and all the 
other biomasses (phytoplankton, fish, squid, and detritivores) remain constant. 

Given the following values: 

• NPP of phytoplankton = 2.0 kilograms of organic carbon per gram of phytoplankton per day 
• plant production efficiency  = 60% 
• fish exploitation efficiency  = 50% 
• fish assimilation efficiency = 20%
• fish net production efficiency  = 5% 
• squid exploitation efficiency  = 50% 
• squid assimilation efficiency  = 80% 
• squid net production efficiency  = 40% 

a) What NPP (in kilograms of carbon) is required to support a harvest of 10 kg of squid carbon 
per week at steady state?  Show your work. 
10kg / (.4)(.8)(.5)(.05)(.2)(.5) = 12,500 kg/week

Question 2, continued 

b) Month after month, your squid harvest is 10 kg/week and all the biomasses remain 
constant. One month, you find that you can only harvest 5 kg of squid carbon/week and 
maintain steady state. 

You suspect that something has contaminated your tank and reduced your yield.  You propose 
two models to account for the reduction in yield. To test these models, you measure the 
respiration rate of the detritivores in the tank. You find that detritivore respiration has 
increased by 5 kg of carbon per week. 

Model 1: Phytoplankton photosynthesis is inhibited so that they now only produce  1.0 
kilogram of organic carbon per gram of phytoplankton per day, but at this new steady state, 
all other efficiencies remain constant. 

i) Is this model consistent with your measurement? Explain. 
This model would predict that 1/2 as much carbon would be fixed by the phytoplankton. Since all 
efficiencies remain the same, this would cause all flows to decrease to 50% of their non-poisoned 
levels. This would therefore reduce the detritivore respiration by 50%. This is not consistent 
with the observed increase. 

Model 2:  5 kg of fish per week are dying with all other efficiencies remaining constant. 

ii) Is this model consistent with your measurement?  Explain. 
This model would predict that 5 kg carbon per week of fish are dying and therefore becoming 
detritus. Since all efficiencies are the same and the tank remains at steady state, this additional 
input to the detritus must be made up for by an equal increase in output from detritus. Since the 
only output from detritus is respiration (refractory carbon cannot increase at steady state), 
detritivore respiration must increase by 5 kg carbon per day. This is consistent with your 
measurement.

Question 3 

a) You have just won the lottery and you and 10 friends decide to sail around the world in 
your new yacht.  Unfortunately, due to stormy seas in the Pacific, you find yourselves 
shipwrecked on a remote island near Micronesia.  On the island there are trees and edible 
plants, plant-eating boars, and lions.

i) In one sentence, describe what each of the following flows represents. 

A:  NPP = net primary production, all plant matter available to herbivores 

C:  Herbivore ingestion = the plant matter actually consumed by herbivores 

D:  Plant detritus = plant material not consumed by herbivores 

F:  Herbivore respiration = the energy lost by herbivores 

b) In terms of the flows given on the energy flow diagram: 

i) What is the production efficiency of the carnivores? PEc = L/L + J 

ii) What is the exploitation efficiency of the herbivores? EEH = C/A 

iii) If the NPP is 1 x 106 grams C, what is the respiration of herbivores if the EEH = 0.5, 
AEH = 0.2, PEH = 0.6? RH = (1 x 106)(0.5)(0.2)(1 - 0.6) = 40,000 grams carbon 

iv) Using the letters given on the above diagram, write the equation for NEP, net 
ecosystem production (also call NCP, net community production).  The NEP is the 
organic carbon produced through photosynthesis and not lost through respiration. 
(M is the respiration of the detritivores.) 
NEP = A - (F + J + M)

Question 3, continued 
c) As vegetarians, your introduction into the ecosystem changes the energy flow of the system. 
In the table below indicate if the flow would increase, decrease, or stay the same as a 
consequence of your introduction into the ecosystem.  Assume the gross primary production 
(GPP) does not change.  There may be more than one correct answer, so choose only one and 
explain your answer.

easier prey. 

people hunt the lions, less lions less flow into the 
carnivore trophic level. 

d) Some time after your introduction to the island, the ecosystem reaches a new steady state. 
Unfortunately, a tribe of cannibals visits the island, captures you, your friends, and all the 
plant-eating boars and returns to their homeland.  (You are later rescued and return to MIT to 
finish your studies).  Once the terrestrial ecosystem reaches a new equilibrium, how has the 
number of trophic levels changed?  Explain your answer. 
The number of trophic levels has decrease by two.  The entire herbivore trophic level has been captured 
and removed, therefore the carnivore trophic level will also be lost.

Question 4 

Biogeochemical cycles are necessary for life to exist.  Three of the most important cycles are the 
Nitrogen, Carbon, and Hydrological Cycles. 

a) After reading the article, “Human domination of Earth’s Ecosystems,” describe the impact 
that humans have had on each of these cycles. 
Humanity adds CO2 to the atmosphere via mining and fossil fuels, also by converting forests and 
grasslands to low-biomass ecosystems.  The levels of CO2 have thus increased.  This will directly affect 
the climate and will cause increased temperature levels due to the phenomena of global warming.  Also, 
increased levels of CO2 cause abnormal growth in plants to a degree where the tissue chemistry of plants 
change, decreasing food quality for animals and microbes. 

Humans deplete waterways that are important because of their influence in many ecosystems, their 
ability to aid in flood control and dilution of chemical wastes.  Our irrigation increases atmospheric 
humidity in semiarid areas – which increases precipitation and thunderstorm frequency.  We are also 
draining large quantities of ground water which is not being replaced. 

Nitrogen cycle has dramatically changed due to human activities.  Nearly all nitrogen fixation prior to 
industrialization was carried out by bacteria. We now have the ability to have been fix 
vast quantities of N2 into organic nitrogen that is used as fertilizer.  Much of this nitrogen flows into the 
waterways and into the oceans. We are adding nearly twice as much fixed N to the terrestrial 
exosystems – this increases the concentration of the greenhouse gas NO. 

b) Explain why the Biosphere2 project suffered from a critical decrease in O2 levels.  Sketch the 
carbon cycle as it would have been in the Biosphere2 dome. 
Biosphere 2 suffered because they added too much organic matter in the soil.  This caused a feeding 
frenzy for the microorgranisms that fed off the organic matter, causing increased respiration, thereby 
increasing the amount of O2 in the air. 

c) The productivity (the g C m-2 year ) of an acre of farmland in California looks to be much 
-1
greater than the productivity of that same land prior to agricultural advances.  Give three 
reasons why this increase in productivity is overestimated. 
Today, farmland is prepared using large equipment, and much carbon in the form of fossil fuel was used 
to produce this machinery.  This machinery requires fossil fuel to function.  Irrigation also requires 
fossil fuel, as does the production of the fertilizers used to increase crop production.  To access whether 
productivity per acre of farmland has increased, this fuel cost need to be subtracted from the total g C m-

year .

Question 4, continued 

d) When considering how well life will thrive in an aquatic environment, two major factors are 
usually considered:  the ability of light to penetrate to an appropriate depth and the 
availability of various nutrients in the water.  Many organisms thrive near the surface of the 
water because of the accessibility to sunlight, but eventually the nutrients in the surface water 
are insufficient to sustain life.  Much of the dead biomass floats to the bottom where it 
decomposes and creates a nutrient-rich environment.  However, light cannot penetrate to this 
depth and so very little can grow.  Moreover, a steep temperature gradient called a 
thermocline prevents mixing of the upper and lower waters. 

Explain the following phenomena in term of limiting factors and thermoclines: 

i) Plankton thrive in the wake of a hurricane. The hurricane mixes the ocean to a greater 
depth than does normal wind.  This disturbs the thermocline and brings nutrient rich water to 
the surface allowing the plankton to thrive. 

ii) Algae bloom in lakes in the spring. 
Cooling of lakes in the winter destroys the thermocline present in warmer temperatures. In the 
spring, nutrient rich water is at the surface allowing the algae to thrive. 

iii) An increase the primary productivity along the coast. 
The thermoclines are eroded along the coast due to coastal upwelling. 

d) In New England the soil has a higher percent of nitrogen and phosphorus than does the 
living biomass.  In a tropical forest, the reverse is true.  In an experiment, you fertilize soil from 
the rain forest with phosphorus and nitrogen containing compounds and find an increase in 
plant growth. 

i) If you repeated the experiment in a New England forest, would you expect the same 
result?  Explain your answer. 
The fertilization of New England forests would have less effect because the soil has a higher 
proportion of these nutrients. 

ii) What two major factors influence the density of biomass in an environment? 
The two major factors are temperature and water availability.
