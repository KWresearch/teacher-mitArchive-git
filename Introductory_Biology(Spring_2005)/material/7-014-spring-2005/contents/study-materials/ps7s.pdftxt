Solutions to 7.014 Problem Set 7

Question 1 
On your trip to the Amazon you were introduced to a new plant that the indigenous people
use as an anti-viral treatment.  You took samples home to your lab and you found that this
plant makes a protein (the PV protein) that prevents viral replication.  Excited by the possible
anti-AIDS applications, you construct a genomic DNA library from this plant in the hope of
cloning the PV gene. 
a) What is a genomic DNA library?
A collection of bacterial cells (or phage particles) each of which contain a different small piece of the
genomic DNA that you are interested in. 

b) You get a DNA sample from cells, digest it with a restriction enzyme, and clone it into a
vector. List 3 features of the vector that are absolutely required for your library construction.
An origin of replication (ori)

A cloning site

A selectable marker 

c) Circle on the following lists ALL you would need in order to construct the genomic DNA
library. Assume you start with intact plant genomic DNA. 
Enzymes 
Restriction enzyme
Ligase
DNA Polymerase 
RNA Polymerase 
Transcriptase 
Reverse Transcriptase 
3' to 5' exonuclease 
Cloning vector 

Reagents 
Size separation gel 
Okasaki fragments 
ATP, TTP, CTP, GTP 
ddATP, ddTTP, ddCTP, ddGTP 
Primers 
Replication fork 
E. coli (bacteria) 
Human cells 
Virus 

Briefly describe the function of each item circled.
Restriction enzyme: cut the vetor and the genomic DNA
Ligase: join together the cut DNA fragments
Cloning vector: receives the cut genomic DNA and allows propagation in the bacterial cell host.
E. coli: Acts as a host that receives the recombiant plasmids and replicated this new DNA

Question 1, continued 
d) Your genomic DNA library is now ready. You have PV protein sequence information and
want to make a DNA probe that is 12 nucleotides long.  Given the protein sequence below,
circle the amino acids that you will use to design your DNA probe.  Why did you choose these
amino acids? 

leu-arg-met-gly-ser-ala-val-leu-pro-thr-arg-ser-trp-met-tyr-lys-arg-his-thr-ser-ala-cys-met-pro-phe 

These amino acids can be encode by fewer possible DNA sequences that any other four consecutive
amino acids. 

You screen the library to find the PVgene.  You find three different clones that hybridize to
your probe.  You purify the plasmid from each clone, digest it with the restriction enzyme you
used when making your library, and then run the samples in a size separation gel. You
observe the following pattern:

e) Why do you get two bands of different sizes for each clone?
The digest as described give one band for the vector, and one band for the insert. 

f) Do you expect your gene to be inserted in the same direction in clones 1, 2 and 3? Why?
No, because we cut with only one enzyme the ends of the fragment are identical and it can insert in 
either direction.

Question 1, continued 
You decide to analyze clone 1 further. You purify the genomic insert and then digest it with
BglII and with BamHI and then run the cut DNA on a size separation gel. You obtain the

h) You decide to sequence the 5' end of the PV gene in clone 1, and to PCR amplify the entire
PV gene from clone 1.  Sequencing reactions only provide about 600 bp of sequence.  Choose 
the MINIMUM number of primers necessary for your experiments. Give the primer number(s)
in the space provided. 
For PCR:  1 and 4

Question 2 
You have discovered a new restriction enzyme, which you have decided to name NewI.
Unfortunately all you know about this enzyme is that it is a restriction endonuclease.  You 
decide to give this enzyme a variety of DNA sequences in order to determine the site at which
it can cut. 
a) You find that when long stretches of different sequences are cut by this enzyme it tends to
cut once every 256 base pairs.  Given that DNA is composed of four different bases (ACGT)
and that NewI cuts at only one sequence, what is the most likely length of the sequence that
NewI recognizes.
4^4 = 256

So it would cut every four base pairs.

b) You would now like to determine what exact sequence is recognized by NewI.  You have a 
collection of DNA molecules that NewI cuts and a collection of DNA molecules that it fails to 
cut.  What technique would you use to determine the recognition site?
Sequence all of the fragments that were cut (or alternatively all the fragments that were not cut)
and look for a common sequence of four base pairs in all of them. 
c) Once you have determined the sequence of the recognition site of NewI, you decide to use it
to create a new vector.  You have a vector that produces the bacterial protein β-galactosidase,
and you want to modify this vector so that you can now produce human insulin.  You 
successfully remove the DNA encoding the β -galactosidase protein (the promoter and the
operator region remain) and replace it with the cDNA for the human insulin gene.  You then 
transform the recombinant plasmid into E. coli cells.  Your manipulations are successful, yet
the cells carrying your new plasmid do not make human insulin.  Give two (or more) reasons
why your experiment failed.
The human cDNA may have inserted in the reverse orientation giving a protein that does not
match the human insulin sequence.  You also have to make sure that you induced the promoter using
either lactose or a synthetic analogue such as IPTG.  (Another problem is the fact that insulin needs to
be post-translationally modified in order to be active and bacteria do not contain the enzymes to do this.
In addition the lack of certain chaperones in bacteria will cause the human insulin to be mis-folded and
found in inclusion bodies.)

Question 3

Combinatorial gene rearrangements occur within the cells that produce antibodies. 
a) What advantage does this provide the immune system in terms of antibody production?
It allows the immune system to produce a huge diversity of antibodies without the need for
individual genes for each antibody. 
b) During the process of gene rearrangement heavy and light chains are formed from
combination of V, D and J gene segments.  Assume that: 
(1) any VH segment can join to any JH or DH segment and any VL segment can join to any JL segment
(2) any DH segment can join to any JH segment, and
(3) any light chain can associate with any heavy chain.
Given the following genome organizations, determine how many different antibody molecules
can be constructed. 
L: 8 VL and 4 JL 
(i) 
H: 8 VH, 4 DH and 4 JH 
8*4*8*4*4 = 4,096 
L: 100 VL and 2 JL 
H: 100 VH, 10 DH, and 2 JL 
100*2*100*10*2 = 400,000 
(iii)  L: 2000 VL and 4 JL 
H: 2000 VH, 20 DH and 4 JH 
2000*4*2000*20*4 = 1,280,000,000

Question 4 
A common method for diagnosing an individual as being HIV(+) or HIV(-) is to look for
antibodies to the virus within the serum of that individual.  A positive result from this test
generally indicates that an individual has been exposed to the virus.  A negative result from
this test does not necessarily mean that the individual is in fact not infected. 

a) How could an individual be infected with HIV and yet test negative by the antibody test?
If you were only recently infected with the virus, your body would not yet have produced an
immune response and so the test would be negative. 
b) Given that HIV integrates itself into the genome and that its sequence is known, what other
method could be used to detect the presence of the HIV virus?  Briefly describe this technique,
listing the reagents that are necessary to perform it. (Hint: The amount of viral DNA in one human 
cell is not very great, how would you make more viral DNA). 
You could do PCR using viral specific primers.  You would need T-cell DNA, Taq polymerase,
buffer, dNTPs, and the primers.  You would denature the T-cell DNA by heating, anneal the primers by
cooling and then amplify the DNA sequence using the polymerase.  You repeat this technique 30-40
times to produce massive quantities of viral DNA.  If you run a gel of the PCR and see a band it would
tell you that there was viral DNA present in the T-cells that you tested.
