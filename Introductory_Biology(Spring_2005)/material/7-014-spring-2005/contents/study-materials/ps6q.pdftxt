Question 1, continued 

b) One summer, you decide to become an UROP student for a professor who studies the 
genetics of corn, Zea mays.  When you cross the following a true-breeding strain of corn with 
purpled, smooth kernels to a true-breeding strain of corn with yellow, wrinkled kernels you 
find that the F1 progeny all have purple, smooth kernels.  You then cross two F1 progeny and 
see the following in the F2 generation. 

P0 Phenotype 

Purple, Smooth Kernels 

Yellow, Wrinkled Kernels 

F1 Phenotype

i) Does the pattern above indicate a Mendelian method of inheritance for the traits of 
kernel color and kernel texture?  Explain. 

ii) Kernel color is encoded by gene A, where A is associated with the dominant 
phenotype and a is associated with the recessive phenotype.  Similarly, kernel texture is 
encoded by gene B, where B is associated with the dominant phenotype and b is 
associated with the recessive phenotype.  Indicate the genotype(s) for each of the corn 
plants in the above boxes under Genotypes**.

c) You are unsure of the genotype of an individual F2 corn plant (from Part b) that has purple, 
smooth kernels and would love to know its genotype. 

i) What cross would allow you to determine the genotype of the purple, smooth corn 
plant? 

ii) Describe the four different possible scenarios from your cross above.  Indicate 
phenotypes and genotypes. 

Question 2 

The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster has been a focus of genetic studies since the early twentieth 
century with the pioneering experiments of Thomas Hunt Morgan.  It is a good system for 
genetic studies because of its small size, ease of cultivation, and short generation time. 

As a junior Drosophologist, you discover a mutation that results in flies with curly wings.  You 
gather 30 curly-winged flies and perform the following P0 and F1 crosses and receive the 
results below: 

P0	

F

1 

30 curly-winged flies  × 30 normal-winged flies 
↓ 

603 
curly-winged flies 

197 
normal-winged flies 

You then perform several self-crosses with the two kinds of F1 flies 

Self-Cross of curly-winged flies 
↓	

598 curly-winged flies & 
205 normal-winged flies 

Self-Cross of normal-winged 
flies ↓

Question 2, continued 

b) The curly phenotype follows a  Mendelian mode of inheritance, so why don’t the numbers 
of offspring follow Mendelian ratios? 

c)  Enamored by the robustness of Drosophila genetics, by the cuteness of curly-winged flies, 
and by the prospects of an entrepreneurial venture selling flies to frog and lizard pet owners, 
you decide to breed flies with altered wings.  (FYI: Curly- and short-winged flies do not fly as 
well as normal-winged flies so frogs and lizards can feed easily.)  You create two different 
pure-breeding strains of short winged flies and call them sht1 and sht2.  In both strains, the 
short-winged phenotype is recessive. 

i) What experiment would allow you to determine whether these two strains carry 
mutations in the same gene or in two different genes?  What results would you expect if the 
two strains have mutations in different genes? 

d) You identify mutations in two genes that result in the following recessive phenotypes: (1) 
flies homozygous for dbl1 have double-wings and (2) flies homozygous for prpl1 have purple 
eyes rather than red eyes.  You then perform the following cross: 

Normal-winged, 
Red-eyed flies 
dbl1+  dbl1- prpl1+  prpl1-

× 

double -winged, 
Purpled-eyed flies 
dbl1- dbl1- prpl1- prpl1-

i) What would the phenotypic ratios of the progeny be if dbl1 and prpl1were unlinked genes? 

ii) Instead of finding that the genes dbl1 and prpl are unlinked, you find that dbl1 and 
prpl1 are linked.  When you perform the above cross, you find the following progeny: 

68 normal-winged, red-eyed flies 
73 double-winged, purple-eyed flies 
6 normal-winged, purple eyed flies 
9 double-winged, red-eyed flies 

Calculate the recombination frequency between the dbl1 and prpl1genes

Question 3 

There are four blood types in human: A, B, AB, and O.  This is a single gene trait with three 
alleles.  The A and B blood types (associated with alleles IA  and IB , respectively) are both 
dominant to the O blood type (associated with  i allele). The A and B blood types are co-
dominant to each other.  You are a genetic counselor and physician at the Massachusetts 
General Hospital.  The combinations for genotypes and phenotypes are listed below: 

Genotype 
IAIA and IAi 
IBIB and IBi 
IAIB 
ii 

Phenotype 
A 
B 
AB

O


a) One of your female patients makes an inquiry to see if her friend was actually the father of 
her child.  The mother is blood type B and the child is blood type O. 

i) Unfortunately, the possible father was killed while performing dangerous genetic 
experiments with corn and fruitflies.  Your patient believes that this man had blood 
type A.  Would this information exclude this man as the father of the child?  Explain. 

ii) Luckily, the possible father’s parents are still alive and they submit blood samples to 
be tested: his father and mother are both blood type AB.  You also find records that the 
possible father was actually blood type A.  Is the accused father the actual father of the 
child?  Explain. 

b) You are given the following pedigree for family blood types: 

i)  If Individual 1 is blood type B, what is the probability that she will have the genotype 
IBi? 

ii) The parents of Individual 1 now have a newborn child that is blood type A.  What is 
the probability that Individual 1 would have the genotype IAIB?

Question 4 

You are now studying the process of mitosis and meiosis in the simple organism, Notuu briitus, 
and have prepared microscope slides of fixed (preserved) and treated these cells with DAPI, a 
chemical that will mark chromosomes/DNA of a cell under fluorescent microscopy.  N. briiitus 
only have two chromosomes.  You also have the ability identify the location of two unlinked 
genes, A and B (A is dominant, a is recessive; B is dominant b is recessive); this facilitates your 
ability to genotype the cells.  You have forgotten to label your slides while preparing them and 
attempt to sort the stage of the cell cycle that each may contain: G1, S, G2, Mitosis (Prophase, 
Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase), Meiosis (Prophase I, Metaphase I, Anaphase I, Telophase I, 
Prophase II, Metaphase II, Anaphase II, Telophase II), or cytokinesis. 

Answer the following questions to determine the characteristics of the slide that you are 
viewing under the microscope. 

a) Slide 1: You look in the microscope and find a single cell with decondensed chromosomes. 
The genotype of the cell is AAaaBBbb. 

i) Does the cell have a 1n, 2n or 4n amount of DNA? 

ii) What phase of the cell cycle does this belong to? 

b) In the space below, draw what you would see in the scope.  Indicate where the alleles—A, a, 
B, and b—are located on the chromosomes.

c) Slide 2: You look in the microscope and find all chromosomes are aligned at the center of a 
single cell.  The genotype of the cell is AAaaBBbb. 

i) Does the cell have a 1n, 2n or 4n amount of DNA? 

ii) What phase of the cell cycle does this belong to? 

iii) If the cell completed its current path along the cell cycle what would be the 
genotypes of the resulting cells. 

iv) In the space below, draw what you would see in the scope in slide 2.  Indicate where 
the alleles—A, a, B, and b—are located on the chromosomes. 

d) Slide 3: On this slide, you find two cells where sister chromatids are paired but are 
beginning to be pulled to one side of the chromosome by the spindle located on either side of 
the cell poles.  The genotype of one cell is AAbb.  The other cell is aaBB. 

i) Does the cell have a 1n, 2n or 4n amount of DNA? 

ii) What phase of the cell cycle do these cells belong to? 

iii) If the cell completed its current path along the cell cycle what would be the 
genotypes of the resulting cells. 

iv) In the space below, draw what you would see in the scope.  Indicate where the 
alleles—A, a, B, and b—are located on the chromosomes.

Meiosis I, Meiosis II)?
