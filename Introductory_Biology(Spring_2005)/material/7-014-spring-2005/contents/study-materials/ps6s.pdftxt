7.014 Problem Set 6 Solutions 

Question 1 
a)  Define the following terms: 

Dominant – In genetics, the ability of one allelic form of a gene to determine the phenotype of a 
heterozygous individual, in which the homologous chromosomes carries both it and a different 
(recessive) allele. 
Recessive – In genetics, an allele that does not determine phenotype in the presence of a dominant 
allele. 
Phenotype – The observable properties of an individual resulting from both genetic and

environmental factors.

Genotype – An exact description of the genetic constitution of an individual, either with respect to a 
single trait or with respect to a larger set of traits. 
Alleles – The alternate forms of a genetic character found at a given locus on a chromosome. 
Homozygous – In a diploid organism, having identical alleles of a given gene on both homologous 
chromosomes. An individual may be a homozygote with respect to one gene and a heterozygote with 
respect to another. 
Heterozygous – Of a diploid organism having different alleles of a given gene on the pair of

homologues carrying that gene.

Mendel’s First Law – Law of Segregation - In genetics, the separation of alleles, or of homologous 
chromosomes, from one another during meiosis so that each of the haploid daughter nuclei 
produced by meiosis contains one or the other member of the pair found in the diploid mother cell, 
but never both. 
Mendel’s Second Law – Law of Independent Assortment - During meiosis, the random separation 
of genes carried on nonhomologous chromosomes. 
Sex-Linked – The pattern of inheritance characteristic of genes located on the sex chromosomes of 
organisms having a chromosomal mechanism for sex determination. 
Haploid – Having a chromosome complement consisting of just one copy of each chromosome; 
designated 1n or n. 
Diploid – Having a chromosome complement consisting of two copies (homologues) of each

chromosome. Designated 2n.

b)  One summer, you decide to become an UROP student for a professor who studies the genetics of 
corn, Zea mays.  When you cross the following a true-breeding strain of corn with purpled, smooth 
kernels to a true-breeding strain of corn with yellow, wrinkled kernels you find that the F1 progeny 
all have purple, smooth kernels.  You then cross two F1 progeny and see the following in the F2 
generation.

i) Does the pattern above indicate a Mendelian method of inheritance for the traits of kernel color 
and kernel texture?  Explain. 
The pattern above corroborates with a Mendelian mode of inheritance: (1) The breeding of two 
true breeding strains results in a single F1 progeny indicating that the purple kernel and the 
smooth kernel traits each correspond to dominant phenotypes, whereas the yellow kernel and the 
wrinkled kernel traits coorespond to recessive traits. (2) In the F2 generation, we find that the 
kernel color gene and the kernel texture gene are unlinked, or likely to be on different 
chromosomes.  These F2 progeny are the result of segregation of alleles and independent 
assortment during meiosis 
ii) Kernel color is encoded by gene A, where A is associated with the dominant phenotype and a 
is associated with the recessive phenotype.  Similarly, kernel texture is encoded by gene B, 
where B is associated with the dominant phenotype and b is associated with the recessive 
phenotype.  Indicate the genotype(s) for each of the corn plants in the above boxes under 
Genotypes**.

Question 1, continued 

c)	 You are unsure of the genotype of an individual F2 corn plant (from Part b) that has purple, smooth 
kernels and would love to know its genotype. 

i)	 What cross would allow you to determine the genotype of the purple, smooth corn plant? 

A test cross - A cross of a dominant-phenotype individual (which may be either heterozygous or 
homozygous) with a homozygous-recessive individual.  That is, A-B- (purple, smooth)  aabb 
(yellow, wrinkled) 

ii) 	 Describe the four different possible scenarios from your cross above.  Indicate phenotypes and 
genotypes.

Question 2 
The fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster has been a focus of genetic studies since the early twentieth century with the 
pioneering experiments of Thomas Hunt Morgan.  It is a good system for genetic studies because of its small size, 
ease of cultivation, and short generation time. 
As a junior Drosophologist, you discover a mutation that results in flies with curly wings.  You gather 30 curly-
winged flies and perform the following P0 and F1 crosses and receive the results below: 
30 curly-winged flies  × 30 normal-winged flies

a)	

Is the curly-winged phenotype dominant or recessive? 

The curly-winged phenotype is dominant.

Question 2, continued 

b)	 The curly phenotype follows a Mendelian mode of inheritance, so why don’t the numbers of offspring follow 
Mendelian ratios? 
The Curly-winged flies in the parental generation are not true-breeding, i.e., there are some heterozygotes in the mix. 

c)	 Enamored by the robustness of Drosophila genetics, by the cuteness of curly-winged flies, and by the 
prospects of an entrepreneurial venture selling flies to frog and lizard pet owners, you decide to breed flies 
with altered wings.  (FYI: Curly- and short-winged flies do not fly as well as normal-winged flies so frogs and 
lizards can feed easily.)  You create two different pure-breeding strains of short winged flies and call them 
sht1 and sht2.  In both strains, the short-winged phenotype is recessive. 

i) What experiment would allow you to determine whether these two strains carry mutations in the 
same gene or in two different genes?  What results would you expect if the two strains have 
mutations in different genes? 

You would perform a complementation test, whereby you cross the short-winged sht1 strain (sht1/sht1) with the 
short-winged sht2 strain (sht2/sht2).  If they were in the same gene, the progeny from this cross would have short wings 
(sht1/sht2).  However, if the mutations represent two different genes, you would only get normal-winged flies (if they 
are on the same chromosome: sht1 +/+ sht2. Or, if they are on a different chromosome sht1/+; sht2/+. 

d)	 You identify mutations in two genes that result in the following recessive phenotypes: (1) flies homozygous 
for dbl1 have double-wings and (2) flies homozygous for prpl1 have purple eyes rather than red eyes.  You 
then perform the following cross: 

Normal-winged, 
Red-eyed flies 
dbl1+  dbl1- prpl1+  prpl1-

× 

Curly-winged, 
Purpled-eyed flies 
dbl1- dbl1- prpl1- prpl1-

i)	 What would the phenotypic ratios of the progeny be if dbl1 and prpl1were unlinked genes? 
1 (or _) normal-winged, red-eyed flies (dbl1+/dbl1- ; prpl1+/prpl1-) 
1 (or _) normal-winged, purple-eyed flies (dbl1+/dbl1- ; prpl1-/prpl1-) 
1 (or _) double-winged, red-eyed flies (dbl1-/dbl1- ; prpl1+/prpl1-) 
1 (or _) double-winged, purple-eyed flies (dbl1-/dbl1- ; prpl1-/prpl1-) 

ii)	

Instead of finding that the genes dbl1 and prpl1 are unlinked, you find that dbl1 and prpl1 are linked. 
When you perform the above cross, you find the following progeny: 

68 normal-winged, red-eyed flies 
73 double-winged, purple-eyed flies 
6 normal-winged, purple eyed flies 
9 double-winged, red-eyed flies 

Calculate the recombination frequency between the dbl1 and prpl1 genes 

Recombination frequency = (total # recombinants)/(total # progeny) = (6+9)/(68+73+6+9) = 15/156 = 0.096

Question 3 
There are four blood types in human: A, B, AB, and O.  This is a single gene trait with three alleles.  The A 
and B blood types (associated with alleles IA  and IB , respectively) are both dominant to the O blood type 
(associated with  i allele). The A and B blood types are co-dominant to each other.  You are a genetic 
counselor and physician at the Massachusetts General Hospital.  The combinations for genotypes and 
phenotypes are listed below: 

Genotype 
IAIA and IAi 
IBIB and IBi 
IAIB

a)  One of your female patients makes an inquiry to see if her friend was actually the father of her child.  The 
mother is blood type B and the child is blood type O. 

i)	 Unfortunately, the possible father was killed while performing dangerous genetic experiments with corn and 
fruitflies.  Your patient believes that this man had blood type A.  Would this information exclude this man as 
the father of the child?  Explain. 

No, the mother (blood type B) may have a genotype of IBi and the accused father (blood type A) may have a 
genotype of IAi.  Therefore, they may each pass their i allele to their child who is O. 

ii) 	 Luckily, the possible father’s parents are still alive and they submit blood samples to be tested: his father and 
mother are both blood type AB.  You also find records that the possible father was actually blood type A.  Is 
the accused father the actual father of the child?  Explain. 

The accused father cannot be the actual father.  Since his parents are both blood type AB, they are both 
genotypically IAIB.  Thus, since the father is blood type A, his parents would pass only the IA allele to their son. 
Therefore, the accused father is IAIA and would not be able to pass an i allele to the fatherless child. 

b) You are given the following pedigree for family blood types: 

i)	

If Individual 1 is blood type B, what is the probability that she will have the genotype IBi? 
If both grandparents are BB then the Dad is BB and the probability is 0.  If either or both grandparent is BO 
and the dad is BO, then the probability is 1/4. 

ii) 	 The parents of Individual 1 now have a newborn child that is blood type A.  What is the probability that 
Individual 1 would have the genotype IAIB? 

Probability = (50% probability of getting IA allele from AB mother) 
B (IBi) father) 

(50% probability of getting IB allele from

Question 3, continued 
c)  For the following pedigrees determine: 

i)  The most likely mode of inheritance (e.g., dominant, recessive, autosomal, X-linked, new 
mutation, etc.) of the genetic disease 
ii)  The probable genotype of the numbered individual(s). Indicate any ambiguities.  Be sure to 
define your genotype symbols clearly. 

Disease A Pedigree 

i) 

Mode of inheritance: Autosomal Recessive (Trait often skips generations. Two unaffected parents 
may have affected offspring.  Consanguinity present in the family.  Members of both sexes have 
equal probability of inheriting the disease allele.) 

ii)  Genotypes: (1) Aa (2) aa 

Disease B Pedigree 

i)  Mode of inheritance: X-linked recessive (More males than females express the trait.  Affected 
females transmit disease allele to all of her sons.) 

ii)  Genotypes: (1) XAXa (2) XaY

Question 3, continued 

Disease C Pedigree 

i)	 Mode of inheritance: (Hint: Think complementation) The disease is caused by two different genes that are 
both autosomal recessive. 

ii)	 Genotypes: (1) AAbb or aaBB (2) AaBb. 

Question 4 
You are now studying the process of mitosis and meiosis in the simple organism, Notuu briitus, and 
have prepared microscope slides of fixed (preserved) and treated these cells with DAPI, a chemical that 
will mark chromosomes/DNA of a cell under fluorescent microscopy.  N. briiitus only have two 
chromosomes.  You also have the ability identify the location of two unlinked genes A and B (A is 
dominant, a is recessive; B is dominant b is recessive); this facilitates your ability to genotype the cells. 
You have forgotten to label your slides while preparing them and attempt to sort the stage of the cell 
cycle that each may contain: G1, S, G2, Mitosis (Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase), Meiosis 
(Prophase I, Metaphase I, Anaphase I, Telophase I, Prophase II, Metaphase II, Anaphase II, Telophase 
II), or cytokinesis. 

Answer the following questions to determine the characteristics of the slide that you are viewing under 
the microscope. 

a)	 Slide 1: You look in the microscope and find a single cell with decondensed chromosomes.  The genotype of 
the cell is AAaaBBbb. 

i)	

Is the cell haploid, diploid, or tetraploid? Tetraploid. 

ii)	 What phase of the cell cycle does this belong to? Interphase G2 following S phase of the cell cycle. 

b)	

In the space below, draw what you would see in the scope.  Indicate where the alleles—A, a, B, and b—are 
located on the chromosomes. 

(See attached figures.)

Question 4, continued 

c)  Slide 2: You look in the microscope and find all chromosomes are aligned at the center of a single 
cell.  The genotype of the cell is AAaaBBbb. 

i)  Is the cell haploid, diploid, or tetraploid? Tetraploid. 

ii)  What phase of the cell cycle does this belong to? Metaphase of Mitosis 

iii)  If the cell completed its current path along the cell cycle what would be the genotypes of the 
resulting cells. 

Two mitotic products: 2 AaBb 

iv)  In the space below, draw what you would see in the scope in Slide 2.  Indicate where the 
alleles—A, a, B, and b —are located on the chromosomes. 

(See attached figures.) 

d)  Slide 3: On this slide, you find two cells where sister chromatids are paired but are beginning to be 
pulled to one side of the chromosome by the spindle located on either side of the cell poles.  The 
genotype of one cell is AAbb.  The other cell is aaBB. 

i)  Are the cells haploid, diploid, or tetraploid? Diploid. 

ii)  What phase of the cell cycle do these cells belong to? Anaphase II of Meiosis II. 

iii)  If the cell completed its current path along the cell cycle what would be the genotypes of the 
resulting cells. 

Four meiotic products: 2 Ab cells & 2 aB cells 

iv)  In the space below, draw what you would see in the scope.  Indicate where the alleles—A, a, B, 
and b—are located on the chromosomes. 

(See attached figures.)

Question 4, continued 
e)	 Slide 4: In the following slide, you see four cells that have just completed cytokinesis.  The 
genotypes of the cells are as follows: AB, aaB, Ab, b. 

i)	 What is wrong with these cells? These should be the products of meiosis.  However, non-
disjunction at one of the steps in meiosis resulted in a failure of a sister chromatid to separate 
during meiosis II. 

ii)  What phase of the cell cycle could this defect have occurred (Interphase, Mitosis, Meiosis I, 
Meiosis II)? Meiosis II. 

iii)  In the space below, draw what you would see in the scope.  Indicate where the alleles—A, a, B, 
and b—are located on the chromosomes.
