Please print out this problem set and record your answers on the printed copy. 

Problem sets will not be accepted late. 

Question 1 

On your trip to the Amazon you were introduced to a new plant that the indigenous people 
use as an anti-viral treatment.  You took samples home to your lab and you found that this 
plant makes a protein (the PV protein) that prevents viral replication.  Excited by the possible 
anti-AIDS applications, you construct a genomic DNA library from this plant in the hope of 
cloning the PV gene. 

a) What is a genomic DNA library? 

b) You get a DNA sample from cells, digest it with a restriction enzyme, and clone it into a 
vector. List 3 features of the vector that are absolutely required for your library construction. 

c) Circle on the following lists ALL you would need in order to construct the genomic DNA 
library. Assume you start with intact plant genomic DNA. 

Enzymes 

Restriction enzyme 

Ligase 

DNA Polymerase 

RNA Polymerase 

Transcriptase 

Reverse Transcriptase 

3' to 5' exonuclease 

Cloning vector 

Reagents 

Size separation gel 

Okasaki fragments 

ATP, TTP, CTP, GTP 

ddATP, ddTTP, ddCTP, ddGTP 

Primers 

Replication fork 

E. coli (bacteria) 

Human cells 

Virus 

Briefly describe the function of each item circled.

Question 1, continued 

d) Your genomic DNA library is now ready. You have PV protein sequence information and 
want to make a DNA probe that is 12 nucleotides long.  Given the protein sequence below, 
circle the amino acids that you will use to design your DNA probe.  Why did you choose these 
amino acids? 

leu-arg-met-gly-ser-ala-val-leu-pro-thr-arg-ser-trp-met-tyr-lys-arg-his-thr-ser-ala-cys-met-pro-phe 

You screen the library to find the PVgene.  You find three different clones that hybridize to 
your probe.  You purify the plasmid from each clone, digest it with the restriction enzyme you 
used when making your library, and then run the samples in a size separation gel. You 
observe the following pattern:

e) Why do you get two bands of different sizes for each clone? 

f) Do you expect your gene to be inserted in the same direction in clones 1, 2 and 3? Why?

Question 1, continued 

You decide to analyze clone 1 further. You purify the genomic insert and then digest it with 
BglII and with BamHI and then run the cut DNA on a size separation gel. You obtain the 
following results: 

uncut 
insert 

BglII 

BamHI

BglII
BamHI

g) Draw a map of the genomic insert indicating the restriction sites for the enzymes BglII, 
BamHI and the one you used to make the library. 

h) You decide to sequence the 5' end of the PV gene in clone 1, and to PCR amplify the entire 
PV gene from clone 1.  Sequencing reactions only provide about 600 bp of sequence.  Choose 
the MINIMUM number of primers necessary for your experiments. Give the primer number(s) 
in the space provided.

Question 2 

You have discovered a new restriction enzyme, which you have decided to name NewI. 
Unfortunately all you know about this enzyme is that it is a restriction endonuclease.  You 
decide to give this enzyme a variety of DNA sequences in order to determine the site at which 
it can cut. 

a) You find that when long stretches of different sequences are cut by this enzyme it tends to 
cut once every 256 base pairs.  Given that DNA is composed of four different bases (ACGT) 
and that NewI cuts at only one sequence, what is the most likely length of the sequence that 
NewI recognizes. 

b) You would now like to determine what exact sequence is recognized by NewI.  You have a 
collection of DNA molecules that NewI cuts and a collection of DNA molecules that it fails to 
cut.  What technique would you use to determine the recognition site? 

c) Once you have determined the sequence of the recognition site of NewI, you decide to use it 
to create a new vector.  You have a vector that produces the bacterial protein β-galactosidase, 
and you want to modify this vector so that you can now produce human insulin.  You 
successfully remove the DNA encoding the β -galactosidase protein (the promoter and the 
operator region remain) and replace it with the cDNA for the human insulin gene.  You then 
transform the recombinant plasmid into E. coli cells.  Your manipulations are successful, yet 
the cells carrying your new plasmid do not make human insulin.  Give two (or more) reasons 
why your experiment failed.

Question 3 

Combinatorial gene rearrangements occur within the cells that produce antibodies. 

a) What advantage does this provide the immune system in terms of antibody production? 

b) During the process of gene rearrangement heavy and light chains are formed from 
combination of V, D and J gene segments.  Assume that: 
(1) any VH segment can join to any JH or DH segment and any VL segment can join to any JL segment 
(2) any DH segment can join to any JH segment, and 
(3) any light chain can associate with any heavy chain.

Given the following genome organizations, determine how many different antibody molecules 
can be constructed. 
(i) 

L: 8 VL and 4 JL 
H: 8 VH, 4 DH and 4 JH 

(ii) 

L: 100 VL and 2 JL 
H: 100 VH, 10 DH, and 2 JL 

(iii)  L: 2000 VL and 4 JL 
H: 2000 VH, 20 DH and 4 JH

Question 4 

A common method for diagnosing an individual as being HIV(+) or HIV(-) is to look for 
antibodies to the virus within the serum of that individual.  A positive result from this test 
generally indicates that an individual has been exposed to the virus.  A negative result from 
this test does not necessarily mean that the individual is in fact not infected. 

a) How could an individual be infected with HIV and yet test negative by the antibody test? 

b) Given that HIV integrates itself into the genome and that its sequence is known, what other 
method could be used to detect the presence of the HIV virus?  Briefly describe this technique, 
listing the reagents that are necessary to perform it. (Hint: The amount of viral DNA in one human 
cell is not very great, how would you make more viral DNA).
