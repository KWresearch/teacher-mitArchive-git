i) Which amino acid would you change? 
You would change amino acid c.

Change it to something positively charged such as lysine, histidine, or arginine because this

Question 2 

Speedy, Jerry, and Mickey are three mice that live in your apartment.  One night you notice 
that Speedy, less speedy than usual, is the last mouse to reach the cheese that you dropped on 
the floor.  The next week he approaches your frosted flakes with a swaggering gate and 
unusual twitching.  Two days later you find Speedy dead.  You pick him up, gently place him 
in a plastic sandwich bag and take him to the lab where you are a UROP.  The following week 
Mickey meets the same fate. 

Your labmate believes that the mice died from bacterial infections of the fluid in the spinal 
cord and brain, but you believe that they may have suffered from a prion disease (http://science-
education.nih.gov/nihHTML/ose/snapshots/multimedia/ritn/prions/prions1.html).  You perform the following 
experiment independently on each dead mouse. 

1. Remove the brain.
2. Suspend brain matter in liquid.
3. Divide the suspended brain matter into three different samples.
4. Label the samples and treat each sample in the following way.

Sample 1: treat with an agent that destroys nucleic acid 
Sample 2: treat with a protease 
Sample 3: do not treat 

5. Inject each of three new mice with a different sample and wait.

Question 2, continued 

Section: ______


a) You observe the mice treated with the samples and find that… 
• 
the mouse treated with sample 1 gets sick and dies. 
• 
the mouse treated with sample 2 stays healthy. 
• 
the mouse treated with sample 3 gets sick and dies 

Are these results consistent with death by a bacterial infection, a prion disease or neither? 
Explain using the results seen with both sample 1 and 2. 
These results are consistent with death from a prion disease.  Prions are infectious proteins, and as such, 
they would be unaffected by an agent that destroys DNA, hence mice injected with sample 1 would get 
sick.  However, if the infectious agent was bacterial, then treatment with an agent that destroys DNA 
would kill the bacteria and mice injected with sample 1 would stay healthy. 

b) You observe the mice treated with samples from Mickey’s brain and find that… 
• 
the mouse treated with sample 1 stays healthy. 
• 
the mouse treated with sample 2 stays healthy. 
• 
the mouse treated with sample 3 gets sick and dies 

Are these results consistent with death by a bacterial infection, a prion disease or neither? 
Explain using the results seen with both sample 1 and 2. 
These results are consistent with death from a bacterial infection disease.  If the infectious agent is 
bacterial, then treatment with an agent that destroys DNA would kill the bacteria and mice injected 
with sample 1 would stay healthy.  In addition, treatment with an agent that destroys protein would 
also kill the bacteria so mice injected with sample 2 would stay healthy. 

c) You think that the causative agent of a prion disease may be abnormal cheeseheadin (CHN), 
a protein that localizes to synapses in the brain. 

i) Explain what would happen if you mixed abnormal CHN protein with normal CHN 
protein under conditions that are identical to cellular conditions. 
The abnormal CHN protein (the prion) would convert the normal protein to the abnormal form. 

ii) Do you expect both versions of CHN to have the same tertiary structure?  Explain 
why or why not. 
No, The abnormal CHN protein (the prion) has an altered shape, and thus has different tertiary 
structure.

Question 3 

Ignatius Maloy Thursdy, a longtime employee of a large bourbon manufacturer, decides to 
open up a bourbon microbrewery of his own.  To perfect the recipe, he sets up several 
fermentations in his basement, identical in every way to the open-vat fermentations carried 
out in the brewery where he works, except his “vats” are 250 mL, rather than the several 
thousand liters as at the brewery. 

a) Iggy worries that something is wrong when he observes yeast growing in the samples much 
faster than at the brewery.  When the yeast stops growing, he finds that no ethanol has been 
produced, hence no bourbon.  Why did Iggy’s fermentations fail? 
In the small vessels, O2 was readily available for the growing yeast, and rather than ferment glucose to 
ethanol, they used the pyruvate for respiration. 

b) Dismayed by his failure, Iggy decides to go back to school to study the biochemistry of the 
enzymes involved in glycolysis.  He’s fascinated by the enzyme triose phosphate isomerase, 
because the reaction it catalyzes (DHAP �� G3P) proceeds so quickly in the cell.  He reasons 
that since this reaction occurs so quickly in the cell, it would probably occur very quickly in 
the absence of enzyme as well. 

i) Is his reasoning sound?  Explain. 
No, Even if the reaction is thermodynamically favorable, it may not occur due to the activation 
energy (  G‡).  Without enzyme, the (  G‡) can prevent the reaction. 

ii) This reaction is truly reversible and the reverse reaction is equally as likely as the 
forward reaction.  Explain why the reverse reaction, G3P � DHAP seldom occurs in the 
cell. 
G3P is rapidly removed in the next step of glycolysis.  This drives the reactions in the forward 
G3P) direction. 
(DHAP 

c) Iggy needs your help. For both i) and ii) fill in the blank with the appropriate response and 
explain. 

i) The Gibbs free energy of Glucose would be  ________  Glucose-6-phosphate. 

higher than 

lower than 

the same as 

Explain. 
Adding phosphate groups to glucose to form Glucose-6-phosphate requires ATP. 

ii) The Gibbs free energy of Phosphoenolpyruvate would be  ________  Pyruvate. 

higher than 

lower than 

the same as 

Explain. 
We know from glycolysis that this reaction produces ATP.

Question 3, continued 

Section: ______


d) After completing his dissertation, Dr. I.M. Thursdy founds a biotech company with the aim 
of improving the fermentation process.  He isolates 2 strains of mutant yeast that produce 
ethanol faster than normal yeast.  Both have mutations in the enzyme that catalyzes the 
reaction pyruvate � acetaldehyde + carbon dioxide.  He examines the kinetics of both the 
mutant and normal enzymes. 

He finds that at low [pyruvate], the initial velocity of the reaction for both mutant enzymes is 
higher than that of the normal enzyme.  At high [pyruvate], the initial velocity of the reaction 
for mutant enzyme A is higher than the normal enzyme, while for mutant enzyme B the 
reaction is the same as that of the normal enzyme. 

i) The data for the normal enzyme is shown below.  On the same graph, draw the curve 
of [substrate] vs. Vi for mutant A and label the V  and Km for each mutant enzyme.

Question 4 

Section: ______ 

In both cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation, energy from the sun can drive the 
conversion of CO2 into glucose 

a) Explain why respiration is sometimes referred to as the opposite of photosynthesis. 
Photosynthesis = CO2

glucose  and Respiration = glucose  CO2 
Photosynthesis produces O2  and Respiration use it.


b) Even though respiration is sometimes referred to as the opposite of photosynthesis, there 
are many similarities in these two processes.  ATP is generated by a similar mechanism in 
respiration, cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation.  Explain how the movement of 
electrons from one protein complex to another results in the formation of ATP in these 
processes. 
Electrons are passed from one protein to another more electronegative one.  In doing so, H+ ions are 
passed across a membrane creating a charge and concentration gradient.  The H+ ions flow down this 
gradient with the concomitant formation of ATP from ADP. 

c) Explain why the evolution of non-cyclic photophosphorylation was a prerequisite to the

evolution of respiration.

Until the evolution of Non-cyclic photophosphorylation, there was no oxygen in the

atmosphere. Non-cyclic photophosphorylation obtains electrons from H2O forming O2.

Respiration requires O2 to act as the final electron acceptor.
