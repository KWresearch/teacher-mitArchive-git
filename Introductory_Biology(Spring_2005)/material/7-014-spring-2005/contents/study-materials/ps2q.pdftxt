Question 1, continued 

c) The following modified substrate does not bind. You want to change one amino acid of the 
enzyme active site to allow this version of the substrate to bind.  Your change should 
maximize the strength of the interaction between the substrate below and the enzyme.

Question 2 

Speedy, Jerry, and Mickey are three mice that live in your apartment.  One night you notice 
that Speedy, less speedy than usual, is the last mouse to reach the cheese that you dropped on 
the floor.  The next week he approaches your frosted flakes with a swaggering gate and 
unusual twitching.  Two days later you find Speedy dead.  You pick him up, gently place him 
in a plastic sandwich bag and take him to the lab where you are a UROP.  The following week 
Mickey meets the same fate. 

Your labmate believes that the mice died from bacterial infections of the fluid in the spinal 
cord and brain, but you believe that they may have suffered from a prion disease (http://science-
education.nih.gov/nihHTML/ose/snapshots/multimedia/ritn/prions/prions1.html).  You perform the following 
experiment independently on each dead mouse. 

1. Remove the brain.
2. Suspend brain matter in liquid.
3. Divide the suspended brain matter into three different samples.
4. Label the samples and treat each sample in the following way.

Sample 1: treat with an agent that destroys nucleic acid 
Sample 2: treat with a protease 
Sample 3: do not treat 

5. Inject each of three new mice with a different sample and wait.

Question 2, continued 

a) You observe the mice treated with the samples and find that… 
• 
the mouse treated with sample 1 gets sick and dies. 
• 
the mouse treated with sample 2 stays healthy. 
• 
the mouse treated with sample 3 gets sick and dies 

Are these results consistent with death by a bacterial infection, a prion disease or neither? 
Explain using the results seen with both sample 1 and 2. 

b) You observe the mice treated with samples from Mickey’s brain and find that… 
• 
the mouse treated with sample 1 stays healthy. 
• 
the mouse treated with sample 2 stays healthy. 
• 
the mouse treated with sample 3 gets sick and dies 

Are these results consistent with death by a bacterial infection, a prion disease or neither? 
Explain using the results seen with both sample 1 and 2. 

c) You think that the causative agent of a prion disease may be abnormal cheeseheadin (CHN), 
a protein that localizes to synapses in the brain. 

i) Explain what would happen if you mixed abnormal CHN protein with normal CHN 
protein under conditions that are identical to cellular conditions. 

ii) Do you expect both versions of CHN to have the same tertiary structure?  Explain 
why or why not.

Question 3 

Ignatius Maloy Thursdy, a longtime employee of a large bourbon manufacturer, decides to 
open up a bourbon microbrewery of his own.  To perfect the recipe, he sets up several 
fermentations in his basement, identical in every way to the open-vat fermentations carried 
out in the brewery where he works, except his “vats” are 250 mL, rather than the several 
thousand liters as at the brewery. 

a) Iggy worries that something is wrong when he observes yeast growing in the samples much 
faster than at the brewery.  When the yeast stops growing, he finds that no ethanol has been 
produced, hence no bourbon.  Why did Iggy’s fermentations fail? 

b) Dismayed by his failure, Iggy decides to go back to school to study the biochemistry of the 
enzymes involved in glycolysis.  He’s fascinated by the enzyme triose phosphate isomerase, 
because the reaction it catalyzes (DHAP �� G3P) proceeds so quickly in the cell.  He reasons 
that since this reaction occurs so quickly in the cell, it would probably occur very quickly in 
the absence of enzyme as well. 

i) Is his reasoning sound?  Explain. 

ii) This reaction is truly reversible and the reverse reaction is equally as likely as the 
forward reaction.  Explain why the reverse reaction, G3P � DHAP seldom occurs in the 
cell. 

c) Iggy needs your help. For both i) and ii) fill in the blank with the appropriate response and 
explain. 

i) The Gibbs free energy of Glucose would be  ________  Glucose-6-phosphate.

the same as

ii) The Gibbs free energy of Phosphoenolpyruvate would be  ________  Pyruvate. 

higher than 

lower than 

the same as 

Explain. 

d) After completing his dissertation, Dr. I.M. Thursdy founds a biotech company with the aim 
of improving the fermentation process.  He isolates 2 strains of mutant yeast that produce 
ethanol faster than normal yeast.  Both have mutations in the enzyme that catalyzes the 
reaction pyruvate � acetaldehyde + carbon dioxide.  He examines the kinetics of both the 
mutant and normal enzymes. 

He finds that at low [pyruvate], the initial velocity of the reaction for both mutant enzymes is 
higher than that of the normal enzyme.  At high [pyruvate], the initial velocity of the reaction 
for mutant enzyme A is higher than the normal enzyme, while for mutant enzyme B the 
reaction is the same as that of the normal enzyme. 

i) The data for the normal enzyme is shown below.  On the same graph, draw the curve 
of [substrate] vs. Vi for mutant A and label the V  and Km for each mutant enzyme.

Question 4 

In both cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation, energy from the sun can drive the 
conversion of CO2 into glucose 

a) Explain why respiration is sometimes referred to as the opposite of photosynthesis. 

b) Even though respiration is sometimes referred to as the opposite of photosynthesis, there 
are many similarities in these two processes.  ATP is generated by a similar mechanism in 
respiration, cyclic and non-cyclic photophosphorylation.  Explain how the movement of 
electrons from one protein complex to another results in the formation of ATP in these 
processes. 

c) Explain why the evolution of non-cyclic photophosphorylation was a prerequisite to the 
evolution of respiration.
