Solutions to 7.014 Problem Set 3 

Question 1 

Hypothetical organism X has the following DNA sequence.  Part of the promoter is indicated 
by the boxed sequence.  Transcription starts at and includes the bold A/T base pair. 

5’ xxxx TATTTGAT AG CTCTATGCAT GCATGGGTCC TGAAGTTCAG ATCTTTGAGT CATAGGAGTC 3’
3’ xxxx ATAAACTA TC GAGATACGTA CGTACCCAGG ACTTCAAGTC TAGAAACTCA GTATCCTCAG 5’

a) Give the RNA sequence of the first 25 bases following transcription. 
5’ AGCUCUAUGCAUGCAUGGGUCCUGA 3’

b) What are the first 5 amino acids of the resulting protein? 
5’ AUG CAU GCA UGG GUC CUG

 Met HIS ALA TRP VAL LEU


c) Finish translating the following mRNA sequence.

d) The organism that makes the above RNA sequence is exposed to a mutagen.  What does a

mutagen do?

A mutagen alters the DNA sequence of an organism.


e) For each of the following mutations, identify the type of mutation (insertion, deletion, point,

or silent) that occurred in the DNA and the affect on the resulting protein.  Consider each

mutation independently. 

i) C10 � A10 

ii) A40 � U40 

iii) T12 � C12 

If the RNA now has an A instead of a C, then the mutation in the DNA 
was G 
T. Protein has one amino acid different his 
ile. 

If the RNA now has a U instead of an A, then the mutation in the DNA 
was T 
A.  This change is after the stop codon, so no change in the 
protein. 

If the RNA now has a C instead of a T, then the mutation in the DNA was 
A 
G.  This results in CAU  CAC, but both encode his. No change in 
the protein.

Question 1, continued 

f) You purify protein made from different mutant organisms. Each new protein sequence 
results from a single change (insertion, deletion, or substitution) in the sequence given. Modify 
the RNA sequence given such that it would encode each new protein. 

i)  Ile Phe Met His Gly Thr Tyr Ser Glu Ser Tyr

Question 2 

You are studying replication in your favorite bacteria when you notice the replication fidelity 
has decreased by a factor of 100. 

a) You suspect this is caused by a mutation in the gene for the replicative enzyme.  Circle the 
activity that you suspect is altered and results in this decrease in fidelity. 

5’ � 3’ polymerase 

5’ � 3’ exonuclease 

3’ � 5’ exonuclease 

mismatch repair 

helicase 

ligase 

b) You purify the above protein and find that it is approximately half the size you expect it to 
be given DNA sequence data.  Explain what kind of mutation could cause this result. 
UGA. 
Any mutation that causes a premature stop such as UGG, UGU, or UGC 

c) Your roommate in course 5 has designed a unique amino acid and creates a tRNA charged 
with this new amino acid.  This new tRNA recognizes the codon  5’ UGA 3’.  You add this 
charged tRNA to the replication deficient mutant cells from above and find that now the 
fidelity is increased.  Speculate why the addition of the novel tRNA results in this increased 
fidelity. 
The unique amino acid is now inserted at the UGA created by mutation that was described above.  This 
produces a protein that is full length, restores the function of this protein, and therefore we see and 
increase in fidelity.

Question 3 

Martians, tired of hiding from our spacecraft, send their own spacecraft to Earth with some 
single-celled Martian organisms.  They are willing to give these to NASA on the condition that 
we leave Mars alone. 

Instead of having only 4 bases, their DNA has 8 different bases: B, C, D, E, W, X, Y, and Z. 
Chemical analysis of a single-celled Martian organism reveals that its genome is composed of: 

B:  13%  C: 7%  D:  13%  E: 19%  W: 19%  X: 11%  Y: 7%  Z: 11% 

a) Identify which bases pair with each other. 
B  - D

C -Y

E - W

X - Z


b) Martian DNA replicates in a manner analogous to that seen with earthly DNA.  Given this

c) Would a substitution within a codon for trp always change the resulting protein sequence? 
Explain your answer. 
Yes,  there is only one codon for trp, so any substitution will  change the protein. 

d) Would a substitution within a codon for thr always change the resulting protein sequence? 
Explain your answer. 
No, there are 4 codons for thr, so even with a substitution the codon could still encode thr.
