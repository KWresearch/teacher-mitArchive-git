Diploid Genetics and Chromosomal Inheritance 

A.  Diploid Genetics 

For each set of data below, determine the genotype of the parents in cross 1. Where it applies, 
indicate which phenotypes are dominant and which are recessive. 

1. Mice I 
a) cross 1: red-eyed mouse ____________  X  white-eyed mouse ____________ 
all red-eyed 
F1: 	
 
gives
 

 

cross 2: red-eyed F1  X red-eyed F1
	36 red-eyed 
F2: 
gives
 
 
 
 
 
13 white-eyed 

b) cross 1: long-eared mouse ____________  X  short-eared mouse ____________ 
12 long-eared 

F1: 	
gives
 
 
 
 
 
10
 
short-eared


cross 2: long-eared F1  X long-eared F1
 
gives
 
F2: 
	36 long-eared 
 
13
 
 
 
short-eared


 
 

 
 

 
 

2. Flowers
cross 1: blue-flowered plant ____________  X  white-flowered plant ____________ 
 
gives
 
F1: 	
all pale-blue-flowered 

 

cross 2: pale-blue F1  X pale-blue F1
	27 blue 
F2: 
gives
 
 
 
pale-blue

 
 
 
49
 
24
 
 
 
white


 
 
 









3. Blood Type 
a) cross 1: person, type A blood ____________  X  person with type B ____________ 
 
gives
 
F1: 	
all type AB blood 

 

cross 2: type AB F1  X  type AB F1
2 type A 

F2: 	
gives
 
 
 
type
4
 
 
 
AB

 
 
 
1
 
B

type

 
 

b) cross 1: type A blood ____________  X  type B ____________ 
 
gives
 
F1: 	
2 type A blood 

3 type AB blood 
 
 
 
1 type B blood 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 type O blood 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 

4. Mice II
cross 1: tail-less mouse ____________  X  normal mouse ____________ 
10 tail-less 

F1: 	
gives
 
 
 
 
 
9
 
normal


 
 

cross 2:  tail-less F1  X tail-less F1
	10 normal 
F2: 
gives
 
 
21 tail-less 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9
 
dead


 
 
 











B.  Chromosomes and Recombination 

1.  What is the physical basis of the genetic inheritance? 

2.  Why is sexual reproduction a powerful source of variation? 

3.  Why was it evolutionarily advantageous to develop the ability to recombine chromosomes? 

Think about the following question for next time (we will talk about it in Section 16): 
Recombination can occur anywhere along the length of the chromosome. However, we have been 
relying on the fact that genes are inherited as discreet units. How do we reconcile these two things? 
(Hint: think about what usually is the difference between two alleles of the same gene.)
