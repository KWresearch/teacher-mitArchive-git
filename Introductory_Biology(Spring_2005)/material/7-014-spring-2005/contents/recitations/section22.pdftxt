From Yeast to Humans—Essential Genes on the Evolutionary Continium. 

A. CBS protein in yeast and humans 

Recall that earlier in the term we considered the human gene CBS and its yeast analog cys4. Recall that these 
genes each encode the protein cystathionine β-synthase that is responsible for converting homocysteine into 
cystathionine in the cellular pathway of creating cysteine.  

1.	 What is cysteine? Is it important for organism’s survival?  

2.	 What would you expect to be the result of complete absence of the protein product of the yeast CYS4 
gene to be? What about the same question for the human CBS protein? 

3. 	 Would you expect cells that contain no functional copy of CBS enzyme to accumulate some kind of a 
compound? If no, why not? If yes, what kind of a compound would you expect that compound to be? 

4.	

In the experiments we discussed earlier in the term, what was the phenotype of the cys4 mutants on 
complete media? 

5.	 As we told you a number of sessions ago, the deficiency in the human analog of CYS4 gene, CBS, 
lead to a disease called cysteineurea, resulting in variety of serious conditions, including mental 
retardation, heart attack, and stroke. What accounts for such a big difference in phenotype between 
CBS protein deficient yeast and humans? 

B. Phylogenetic analysis 
Below is a figure from a research paper showing alignment of the amino acid sequences of human, rat, yeast, 
and E. coli CBS proteins. 

Figure removed due to copyright reasons.
Please see: 
Kruger, W. D., and D. R. Cox. "A yeast system for expression of human cystathionine beta-synthase:
structuraland functional conservation of the human and yeast genes." Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 91, 
no. 14 (July 5, 1994): 6614-8.
 

1.	 What do the dashes in the sequence represent? 

2. 	 Are the DNA sequences encoding amino acids that are conserved across species above necessarily 
the same? Why or why not? 

3.	 What properties of the particular amino acids allow them to be grouped into the conservative 
groupings as described in the figure legend above? 

4.  Look at the genetic code table. Is there a relationship between the codons encoding amino acids in 
conservative groupings? 

5. 	

Is CBS a good candidate for creating a phylogenetic tree on the basis of its sequence? Why or why 
not? 

6. 	 Are human disease alleles of CBS likely to help with phylogenetic tree construction? Why or why 
not? 

7. 	

If constructing a phylogenetic tree on the basis of CBS alignment, would it be more useful to work 
with the protein or cDNA sequences? cDNA sequences or DNA sequences? Why? 

8. 	 Do you expect the human wild type gene to complement yeast CYS4 deficiency? Why or why not? 

9.	

Is there a way to explore the relationship between human CBS protein and yeast CYS4 protein?
