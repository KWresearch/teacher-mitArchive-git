Biology as a Science 

Please read the following article. Class discussion will focus on the article, and center around the 
questions that follow.  

Please refer to the following article:
Leake, Jonathan, Science editor. "Mobile phones can cut a man's fertility by a third." The Sunday
Times - Britain, June 27, 2004.

1.	 Based on the article, what was the hypothesis tested in this study? 
The hypothesis was that heavy cell phone use negatively impacts sperm quality. 

2. 	 What was the experiment designed to test the hypothesis? 
To test the hypothesis, researchers followed a group of 221 men over the course of 13 
months, and compared sperm quality results of the men who used cell phones with 
results of those who did not. 

3. 	 What were the conclusions drawn from the results of the experiment? 
Experimental results showed that men who used their cell phones heavily had sperm 
count that was 30% reduced when compared to men who did not use cell phones 
heavily. Moreover, they also found reduced morphology in the surviving sperm of the 
cell phone users. Researchers then concluded that heavy cell phone use causes reduced 
sperm quantity and quality. 

4. 	 Are there alternative hypotheses that fit the data?  
One alternative hypothesis is that heavy use of cell phones correlates with a life style 
that causes reduced sperm quantity and morphology.    

5. 	 Based on the article, do you think the researchers proved their hypothesis true? Is the quote 
from Dr. Fejes justified given the data? Why or why not? 
Researchers did not design the experiment to address alternative hypotheses, nor did 
they perform follow up experiments to address such hypotheses.  Therefore, we can not 
conclude that researchers proved their hypothesis true.  
Notice that in his quote, Dr. Fejes says that cell phone use “may have a negative 
effect,” rather than stating that it does. The statement as quoted is technically correct, 
given data. It is, however, significantly more modest than the claims the article makes 
about the study. 

6.	 What follow-up experiments would need to be performed to validate the results of this study?  
One such experiment would be to find a group of men with as homogeneous a lifestyle 
as possible, who do not use cell phones on regular basis. To establish the baseline, test 
their sperm quantity and quality for a short time (say, two months), and exclude any 
who show bad results. Then randomly assign subjects to either the experimental or 
control groups.  Subjects in the experimental group would then receive cell phones, and 
frequent calls on these cell phones from the researchers. Subjects in the control group 
would lead their normal lifestyle. If the subjects in the experimental group show a 
decrease in sperm quantity and quality, it would support the hypothesis that the cell 
phones cause reduced sperm quantity and quality.  To further validate the hypothesis, 
another group of subjects who do not use cell phones alot, but are put under stress 
would be informative. 

7.	 Look again at the synopsis just below the title. Do you think it accurately describes the results 
of the study?  Is it informative or misleading? 
The synopsis is sensationalist, particularly in the last part of the sentence. Nowhere in 
the article was it suggested that the study showed reduced chance of conception in men 
who use cell phones heavily.  In addition, the synopsis makes the results of the study 

sound a lot more convincing than they actually are by not alluding to alternative 
explanations, and by using a relatively strong term “suggested.” 

8.	 Look again at the first and third paragraphs. Do you think the advice to put the phone in a bag 
would be justified given the data we have now? Why or why not? 
The advice, again, is not supported by evidence.  Nowhere in the article does it say that 
the men in the study who experienced reduced sperm count and quality do not already 
carry their cell phones in their bags or briefcases. 

9. 	 Look again at the description of how the study was performed in paragraph two. What would 
you like to know about the procedures used in the study before concluding that the observed 
results are not an artifact of how the study was done? 
Laboratory tests of sperm quality are usually performed on subjects who have abstained 
from sexual activity for 2-3 days.  The article does not mention details of the study 
procedures, so we do not know how often the sperm was tested, and whether the 
subjects were told to abstain from sexual activity for any particular time before each 
test.  If this was not the case, the results may be artifacts of the sexual habits of the men 
in each group. 

Most sections spent some time talking about the scientific method and progression from observation to 
theory or law. Below is a concise description of the process taken from 
http://phyun5.ucr.edu/~wudka/Physics7/Notes_www/node5.html 

The scientific method is the best way yet discovered for winnowing the truth from lies and delusion. 
The simple version looks something like this:  

1. Observe some aspect of the universe.  
2. Invent a tentative description, called a hypothesis, that is consistent with what you have 

observed. 

3. Use the hypothesis to make predictions.  
4. Test those predictions by experiments or further observations and modify the hypothesis in the 
light of your results. 
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until there are no discrepancies between theory and experiment and/or 
observation. 

When consistency is obtained the hypothesis becomes a theory and provides a coherent set of 
propositions which explain a class of phenomena. A theory is then a framework within which 
observations are explained and predictions are made.
