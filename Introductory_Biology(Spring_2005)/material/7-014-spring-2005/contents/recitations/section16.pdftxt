Recombination and Pedigrees 

A.  Chromosomes and Recombination 

1. 	 What is the physical basis of the genetic phenomenon of gene recombination? 

Recitation Section 16 
April 6-7, 2005 

2.	 Why is the recombination frequency between two genes correlated with the physical distance 
between the two genes? 

3.	 Recombination can occur anywhere along the length of the chromosome. However, we have been 
relying on the fact that genes are inherited as discreet units. How do we reconcile these two 
things? (Hint: think about what usually is the difference between two alleles of the same gene.)  

4. 	 Why is the highest possible recombination frequency 50%? 

B.  Pedigrees 

In 1901 a physician in London named Archibald Garrod had some new patients with an unusual 
condition: when their urine came into contact with air it turned black.    

1.	 What is the wild-type phenotype? 

2.	 What is the assay? 

3.	 Who are the mutants? 

Fascinated, Garrod decided to study the disease more. 

4.  How could he go about determining whether the disease shows dominant, 
recessive, or codominant inheritance? 

5.	 What is your prediction for mode of inheritance of this disease? Why? 

6.	 The fact that Garrod saw a number of cases was in fact due to high degree of first cousin 
marriages in the community where he worked.  Such consanguinous matings are often very useful 
in identifying the modes of inheritance of rare traits. Why is that? 

7.	 What, if anything, could he do to study the inheritance pattern experimentally in the lab? 

As it turned out, he gene for Alkaptonuria (ALK) is on human chromosome 9 and is linked to the gene 
encoding the ABO blood group, with a recombination frequency of 11% between the loci. 

A pedigree of a family with the disease is shown below, with affected individuals indicated in black.  In 
addition, the blood type of family members is given.

The two alleles at the ALK locus will be denoted ALK+ and ALK-. 

8.	

 The three alleles at the ABO blood group locus will be denoted IA, IB (which are co-dominant) 
and IO (which is recessive to IA and IB). 
i) What is the genotype of individual 1 at the ALK and ABO loci? 

ii) What is the genotype of individual 2 at the ALK and ABO loci? 

iii)  What is the genotype of individual 3 at the ALK and ABO loci?  Which alleles of each gene 
are carried on the chromosome he inherited from his father and which alleles are carried on the 
chromosome he inherited from his mother? 

iv)  Individuals 3 and 4 are expecting their fifth child.  A physician draws a prenatal 
blood 
sample and determines that the child has blood type B.  Is it likely that the  child will have 
alkaptonuria?  Explain your answer. 

9.	 Consider the pedigree below showing the inheritance of two X-linked diseases, hemophilia A and 
hemophilia B .  Hemophilia A is due to a lack of one clotting factor, and hemophilia B is due to a 
lack of a different clotting factor.  These two clotting factors are encoded by two different genes, 
located at different positions on the X chromosome.  Note that no individual shown in this 
pedigree is affected with both hemophilia A and hemophila B.

i) Write the genotypes for the following individuals at both the hemophilia A and  hemophilia B 
disease loci.  Clearly define your genotype symbols.

B?
