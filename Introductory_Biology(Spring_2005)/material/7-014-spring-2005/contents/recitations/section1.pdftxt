1.	 Based on the article, what was the hypothesis tested in this study? 

2. 	 What was the experiment designed to test the hypothesis? 

3. 	 What were the conclusions drawn from the results of the experiment? 

4.	 Are there alternative hypotheses that fit the data?  

5.	 Based on the article, do you think the researchers proved their hypothesis true? Is the quote 
from Dr. Fejes justified given the data? Why or why not? 

6.	 What follow-up experiments would need to be performed to validate the results of this study?  

7.	 Look again at the synopsis just below the title. Do you think it accurately describes the results 
of the study?  Is it informative or misleading? 

8. 	 Look again at the first and third paragraphs. Do you think the advice to put the phone in a bag 
would be justified given the data we have now? Why or why not? 

9. 	 Look again at the description of how the study was performed in paragraph two. What would 
you like to know about the procedures used in the study before concluding that the observed 
results are not an artifact of how the study was done?
