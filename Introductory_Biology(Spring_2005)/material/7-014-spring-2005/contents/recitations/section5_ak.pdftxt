Biochemistry—Photosynthesis and Respiration 

A.  Photosynthesis background 

1.	 Why do we consider O2 a booster of evolution? 
The organisms doing only glycolysis were slow and small. The net gain of 2ATP molecules from 
a molecule of glucose is not enough to fuel more complicated organisms that populate the 
biosphere today. For that, photosynthesis and respiration needed to develop. The waste product 
of non-cyclic photosynthesis is O2, and its presence allowed respiration to develop, since O2 
could be used as an electron acceptor.  

2.	 Why was it advantageous for a cell to develop photosynthesis? 
When abiotic sources of energy started to decline, it became advantageous to have the ability to 
make ATP. While glycolysis allows an organism to make ATP, it requires a source of organic 
carbon. Developing photosynthesis allowed an organism to become an autotroph—make 
everything it needs from CO2, NH3, PO4, H2O. Thus, in the environment low in abiotic sources of 
energy and carbohydrates photosynthetic organisms have selective advantage. 

3.	 Photosynethesis has two phases—light and dark. What does each phase accomplish? 
The light phase is so named because it is dependent on the presence of light to drive its 
reactions. Light phase reactions use the energy of the excited chlorophylls to make ATP and 
NADPH, while producing O2 as a waste product. 
The dark phase is so named because it is independent from the presence of light. Dark phase is 
also known as a biosynthetic phase—the phase in which atmospheric CO2 is fixed into organic 
carbon.

First schematic is of cyclic photophosphorylation. Steps: 
1)  The process starts when a photon hits a PS1(photosystem 1) chloroplast, exciting two 
electrons on the molecule. 
2)  The two electrons are donated to the electron acceptor (creating a “hole” in the molecule), 
then 
3)  Passed to Acceptor 2(A2), and on to Acceptor 3 [both of these have names, but you do not 
need to remember them]. The later step powers the active transport of hydrogen ions from 
stroma into the thylakoid space.  
4)  Electrons pass from Acceptor 3 back to the PS1 chloroplast (thus, filling the “hole” in the 
molecule left by the electrons in step 2)). 
5)  H+ gradient drives the ions through the ATP synthase, powering the addition of a Pi to an 
ADP, creating ATP. 

Second schematic is of noncyclic photophosphorylation. Steps: 
1)  The process starts when a photon hits a PS2(photosystem 2) chloroplast, exciting two 
electrons on the molecule. 
2)  The two electrons are donated to the electron acceptor (creating a “hole” in the molecule).  
3)  Water is split in the thylakoid, providing the electrons to fill the “hole” in the PS2 
molecule. O2 is released as waste product. 2H+ ions are created, to be used in step 7 below. 
4)  Electrons from the acceptor are passed to A2’, and on to Acceptor 3 [again, all of these 
have names, but you do not need to remember them]. The later step powers the active 
transport of hydrogen ions from stroma into the thylakoid space.  
5)  Electrons pass from Acceptor 3 to the PS1 chloroplast that was hit by a separate photon, 
exciting it, and creating a “hole.”  
6)  Electrons from the PS1 chloroplast are passed on to the electron acceptor and on to A2. 
7)  Electrons on A2 and the protons generated in step 3 are used to reduce NADP+ to 
NADPH+H+. 
8)  H+ gradient drives the ions through the ATP synthase, powering the addition of a Pi to an 
ADP, creating ATP. 

2.  What are the main differences between the two processes? 
In cyclic photophosphorylation, electrons come back to chloroplast molecules, while in 
noncyclic photophosphorylation, the splitting of water provides the electrons to “compensate” 
the original chloroplast, and produces O2 as waste product. In addition, noncyclic 
photophosphorylation produces NADPH as well as ATP. Cyclic photophosphorylation only 
produces ATP. 

3.	 What is the ATP made in photosynthesis used for? 
It is mostly used in dark reactions of photosynthesis to fix CO2 into glucose. 

4.	

In class we learned that cyclic photophosphorylation produces S as waste product. Yet we do not see S 
created anywhere in the schematic above. Where and how is S released? 
In order to fix CO2 into organic carbon, a lot of reducing power is needed. This power is 
provided by NADPH. In cyclic photophosphorylation as we described it so far no NADPH is 
produced. Another, side reaction is run to produce NADPH from NADP+. In that reaction, H2S 
serves as an electron donor, and S is released as waste product.  

5.	 Why do cells need to make glucose out of ATP? Why not just use the ATP produced in photosynthesis?

-Hard to store ATP (for long term storage, want 
currency in gold, not $) 
-Need glucose for other pathways. 
Intricate web of pathways—allows a non-
photosynthetic cell (a heterotroph) to live on 
sugar source alone, or a photosynthetic cell (an 
autotroph) to build everything it needs from a 
small number of precursors. Many reactions 
along the way are endergonic—use ATP to 
power them. 

C.  Aerobic Respiration – Oxidative Phosphorylation  

Dark reactions of photosynthesis are expensive, and glycolysis only produces 2 molecules of ATP.  

This is very inefficient. 


1. 	 What process developed to derive energy from glucose more efficiently? Why was it not 

possible to develop this process before noncyclic photophosphorylation arose?

Oxidative phosphorylation, or respiratory chain, or electron transport chain. The 
process requires O2 as the final electron acceptor, so it could not have arisen before the 
advent of noncyclic photophosphorylation.  

2. 	 Why was it evolutionarily advantageous for a cell to develop aerobic respiration? 
An organism that can utilize its energy reserves more efficiently does not need to make 
or import from the environment as much glucose as a less efficient organism. Thus, in 
the environment with limited abiotic sources of glucose or sunlight, an organism that 
can perform respiration would have selective advantage.

3. 	 Using the schematic, explain why an NADH is “worth” 3 ATPs.   
When an NADH molecule donates an electron. That electron is passed through an 
electron transport chain. Three membrane proteins that take part in the chain are 
powered by this electron to transport a proton from the inner mitochondrial 
compartment to the outer mitochondrial compartment. Finally, the electron is accepted 
by O2, generating water. The protons that were transported to the outer compartment 
now have a large gradient—it is energetically favorable for these protons to get back 
into the inner compartment.  However, the only way they can do so is by passing 
through the ATP synthase, which uses their chemiosmotic energy to power the addition 
of a phosphate to an ADP molecule, creating ATP. Because each NADH molecule 
accounts for three protons pumped into the outer compartment, it helps generate three 
new ATP molecules. Thus, 1 NADH is worth 3 ATPs.   

On the way to complete oxidation, each pyruvate molecule generates 4 NADH molecules, one FADH2 
molecule, and one ATP molecule. FADH2 can participate in the proton gradient mechanism as well, 
but only generates 2 molecules of ATP for each molecule of FADH2. 

4. 	

In lecture it was said that 36 molecules of ATP total are derived from a glucose molecule via 
glycolysis followed by aerobic respiration. Describe where these ATP molecules come from.  
Glycolysis generates 2 molecules of ATP, 2 molecules of NADH, and 2 molecules of 
pyruvate.  Each molecule of pyruvate is worth 15 ATPs (4NADHÆ12ATPs; FADH2 Æ 
2 ATPs, and one ATP molecule generated along the oxidation route). Taking into 
account the two ATPs from glycolysis, that makes 32ATPs. Taking into account the 2 
NADHs from glycolysis, we should be looking at 38 ATPs. However, two ATPs are 
spent moving the electrons from these NADHs produced in the cytoplasm into the 
mitochondria, where ETC can take place. So overall count is 36 ATPs from each 
molecule of glucose.
