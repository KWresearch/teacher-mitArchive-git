A. CBS proteins, 3D representation 

Biochemistry—Proteins 

The protein we will consider today and periodically throughout the term is the yeast cystathionine beta 
synthase (CBS) protein. Today we will see gels visualizing wild-type and mutants versions of the yeast 
CBS protein. Yeast that lack CBS protein can not synthesize the amino acid cysteine. Mutant versions 
of the human CBS protein can lead to a very serious disease called homocystinuria. Some symptoms 
include mental retardation, early strokes and heart disease.  

First consider a crystallographic model of a form of CBS protein. Open the CBS structure html file in 
Internet Explorer.  Rotate the molecule and get an idea of the three dimensional structure of CBS.  

The true 3-dimensional structure of CBS can be observed using the “Show Spacefill” button, and a 
trace of the peptide backbone can be observed using the “Show Ribbon” button. 

1.	 What is the primary structure of a protein? What information does the modeling program 
provide us about the primary structure of CBS? 
The primary structure of a protein is the linear sequence of amino acids.  It is 
impossible to determine this for CBS with the representation that has been provided.  
We could look up the sequence in the Protein Data Bank and it would read something 
like (…Trp-Ile-Arg-Pro-Asp-Ala-Pro-Ser…) through all 430 amino acids. 

2.	 What is the secondary structure of a protein? What information does the modeling program 
provide us about the secondary structure of CBS? 
The secondary structure is described as α-helical or β-sheet.  Remember that secondary 
structure is controlled by backbone hydrogen bonds between amino acids.   CBS 
contains both types of secondary structure.  The majority of the secondary structure 
elements are α-helices.  There are 4 β-sheets. 

3.	 What is the tertiary structure of a protein? What information does the modeling program 

provide us about the tertiary structure of CBS?

The tertiary structure is determined by the side-chain interactions between amino acids 
in adjacent secondary structures.  Although it is hard to resolve the desired interactions 
from this view, it is clear that amino acids in both the α-helices and β-sheets are 
interacting with amino acids in other secondary structure elements to contribute to the 
overall tertiary structure. 

4. 	 What is the quaternary structure of a protein? What information does the modeling program 
provide us about the quaternary structure of CBS?  (Hint: Use the “Color Ribbon by Protein 
Subunit” button) 
The quaternary structure of a protein is created by a number of distinct interacting 
amino acid chains.  If we color CBS by chain we find that there are two amino acid 
strands indicating that the protein is a homodimer. 

B. Protein gels 

1.	 Yeast cells produce enough CBS to fulfill their needs depending on the conditions in which 
they are growing.  In order to procure large quantities of the enzyme, we created special 
bacterial cells that mostly produce CBS.  After we grew up a large number of these bacterial 
cells, what did we have to do to end up with pure CBS for loading on the gel? 
We had to grow up a lot of cells, break them all open, and then go through a gradual 
process of removing all parts of the cell we didn’t need. We removed membranes, 
nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecules. We then removed the majority of 
other proteins that were in the cell at the time of harvest, leaving us with mostly pure 
CBS. 

Some technical issues: 

2.	 What is a gel? 
A gel is a jelly-like matrix. Bigger objects have more trouble fitting through the matrix, 
and, therefore, travel slower through the gel. 

3. 	 How does gel electrophoresis work? 
Our sample preparations and the buffer used in the gel set-up ensure that unfolded 
proteins have negative charge overall. When the electric current is applied, they move 
toward the anode. 

4. 	

If you run two proteins on the same gel, and one travels farther than the other, what can you say 
about the relative sizes of these proteins? 
The one that travels farther has lower molecular weight. 

5.	 With gel electrophoresis, two different conditions are often used.  
a. 	 Denaturing gel: detergent is added to the gel and a reducing agent is added to the 
protein sample. Reducing agent converts the S-S disulfide bonds to SH and SH.  
b.	 Native gel: Physiological pH conditions where no detergent or reducing agent is added.  

Compare the 1°, 2°, 3°, and 4° structure of CBS for each of these conditions: 

 
Denaturing gel 
1°  Primary structure is not disrupted. Same as 
that for CBS proteins present in a cell and 
for those run on native gels. 
2°  Secondary structure lost due to presence of 
detergent and reducing agent. 
3°  Tertiary structure lost due to presence of 
detergent and reducing agent. 
4°  Unable to form quarternary structures due to 
presence of detergent and reducing agent. 

Native gel 
Primary structure is not disrupted. Same as 
that for CBS proteins present in a cell and 
for those run on denaturing gels. 
Secondary structure is not disrupted. Same 
as that for CBS proteins present in a cell. 
Tertiary structure is not disrupted. Same as 
that for CBS proteins present in a cell. 
Quaternary structure is not disrupted. Same 
as that for CBS proteins present in a cell. 

6.  Information about what level(s) of protein structure do you expect to gain from a denaturing 
gel? 

Adding detergent and a reducing agent ensures that the protein will lose its secondary 
and tertiary structure, so the information we get from running such a denaturing gel is 
the size of each subunit of the protein complex. 

7.  Information about what level(s) of protein structure do you expect to gain from a native gel? 
Not adding detergent and a reducing agent allows the protein to enter the gel as a 3D 
structure, so we would be able to gain information about its apparent 3D size.  

8.  What could the native gel tell you that the denaturing could not? 
The native gel would provide information on the number of subunits involved in the 
protein complex.  

Let’s now talk about the proteins themselves. 

In the 3D representation of the CBS protein, consider a single subunit of CBS. Now consider the whole 
CBS protein again. 

9.  Which of these forms would we be visualizing with each kind of gel? 
A native gel would give us an opportunity to visualize the whole CBS protein, while the 
denaturing gel would tell us the size of the individual subunit. These two pieces of 
information put together would tell us how many subunits are in each complete CBS 
protein. 

Imagine we are the researchers who first isolated the wild type and mutant versions of the protein. 
What kinds of things might we want to know about these proteins? 

The five questions from journalism school are very much applicable here: Who? (What is this 
protein?) What? (What does it do in the cell?) When? (When does it act?) Where? (Where does it act?) 
How? (How does it perform its function? What does it interact with?). Note that these are all basic 
questions that can be asked from first principles.   

10. Which of these things can we figure out by running the purified proteins on the gels and which 
ones can’t we? Why? 
We can only get a part of the answer to the last question from the gel. This is because 
we can not definitively answer questions about the protein’s function and mode on 
operation in the cell without looking in the cell. 

11. What other techniques might you want to employ in your research of the purified protein? 
What would you hope to find out from these experiments? 
If we determined by other means that this is an enzyme, we could try to determine what 
reaction the protein catalyzes by seeing whether any of the known or suspected 
substrates will be acted upon. We could also determine whether the enzyme needs a 
cofactor, such as any of the known small molecule co-factors. 

C.  Analyzing the data and interpreting the results 

Take a look at the denaturing gels. One of our proteins migrates a shorter distance than the other.  

1.	 What does this mean? 
It means that the protein that migrates a shorter distance is longer, i.e. has more amino 
acids in its primary structure.  

2.	 As we said earlier, we ran both the wild-type and mutant protein on the denaturing gel. Which 
do you expect to be longer—wild-type or mutant protein? Why? 
It could be either.  A number of different mutations in the DNA sequence coding for a 
protein can create a shorter protein, by prematurely creating a stop instruction.  On the 
other hand, a mutation that disrupts an existing stop instruction for this protein can 
result in creating a longer protein. 
In this particular case, the mutant protein travels farther on the gel, and we, therefore, 
conclude that the mutant protein is shorter than the wild-type protein. 

Take a look at the photocopy of a native gel. 

3.	 What can you say about the difference between the wild type and the mutant enzymes from the 
native gels? 
Native gel data indicates that the mutant protein forms dimers, while the wild-type 
protein forms tetramers and octamers. 

4.	 Would you expect the same section of the monomer subunit of CBS to be used in forming 
dimers as in forming tetramers? Why or why not? 
No. The mutant subunit is shorter, so we conclude that it is missing a portion of the 
amino acid chain with respect to the wild-type protein. The mutant can still form 
dimers, but not tetramers and octamers. Therefore, we expect different parts of the 
monomer subunit to be involved in establishing each of these interactions. 

5.	 Do you think the 3D representation we are working with today is of the wild-type or mutant 
protein? Why? 
The representation is of the mutant protein because it shows dimer as the quarternaty 
structure of the enzyme, and not a tetramer or an octamer. 

Let’s now look at the dimer interface that forms between the two chains.  There are several important 
interactions that hold the two subunits together.  We will look at some residues involved in keeping the 
interface together. 

I. Choose “Central Interaction” 

6.	 What are the residues involved in this interaction?  
Hint: It may help to change the representation of the residues to ball and stick by clicking in the 
box labeled “Ball and Stick on/off” below the 3D window 
Phenylalanine from one chain interact with phenylalanine from the other chain. 

7. 	 What types of amino acids are these residues (acidic, basic, polar, or hydrophobic)? 
Phenylalanine is hydrophobic. 

8. 	 What types of interactions occur between these residues? 
The two phenylalanines interact via a Van Der Waals interaction.  

9.	 Would the CBS dimer interface be more, less or equally as stable if we changed one of the 
phenylalanines to a glutamic acid?  An alanine?  A tryptophan? 
A glutamic acid in this position would probably destabilize the interface because it is very 
polar and positively charged, while phenylalanine is a hydrophobic bulky ring. 
An alanine in this position would also probably destabilize the protein, because although it 
is hydrophobic, it is very small whereas phenylalanine is quite bulky.  The alanine would 
introduce a hole or gap in the dimer interface due to its small size. 
Introduction of tryptophan in this position would be the residue most likely not to 
destabilize the dimer interface.  It is large, aromatic, and hydrophobic, and therefore, 
retains a majority of the qualities of phenylalanine.   

II. Choose “Interaction I” 

10. We have highlighted two identical clusters at opposite ends of the CBS structure.  	Each 
individual cluster contains an alanine and a leucine from chain A and an alanine and a leucine 
from chain B.  What type of amino acids are alanine and leucine? 
Alanine and leucine both have hydrophobic side chains. 

11. What type(s) of interaction(s) are the amino acids in these clusters involved in? 
These residues interact via hydrophobic interactions and van der Waals interactions. 
Hydrophobic interaction refers to a situation where a number of hydrophobic amino acids 
are clustered together, unlike a case where only two hydrophobic amino acids are involved 
in the interaction. In the latter case we say that the strongest interaction is van der Waals 
(see question 8 above). Notice that when hydrophobic interaction is happening, van der 
Waals forces are still present, but are not the strongest interaction. 

12. Would you expect the side chains in this cluster to be exposed to the cytoplasm?	  Why or why 
not? 
We would not expect the side chains to be exposed to the cytoplasm because the cytoplasm 
is primarily composed of water and contains many other polar molecules.  An interaction 
between the nonpolar, hydrophobic side chains of alanine and leucine and water would be 
highly unfavorable.  We expect most hydrophobic clusters to be located on the inside of 
globular proteins. 

III. Choose “Interaction II” 

13. We have highlighted two identical clusters at far ends of the CBS structure.  	Each individual 
cluster contains a glutamine and an aspartic acid on one chain, and a lysine on the other.  What 
types of amino acids are these residues? 
Glutamine has a polar side chain, aspartic acid has an acidic side chain, and lysine has a 
basic side chain. 

14. What type(s) of interaction(s) are found in this cluster? 
Glutamine may interact with either lysine or aspartic acid via a hydrogen bond.  Lysine and 
aspartic acid bond together via an ionic bond. 

15. Select “Interaction II with all atoms shown.” This view shows all the atoms of CBS (not 
including hydrogens) as transparent dots.  Are the amino acids involved in Interaction III found 
on the exterior or interior of the protein?  Does this make sense if CBS is a soluble protein? 
These amino acids are on the exterior of surface of CBS.  It would be energetically 
favorable for this cluster to be exposed to a hydrophilic solvent like the cytoplasm or water 
because the amino acid side chains involved in this cluster could hydrogen bond with other 
polar molecules. 

16. Choose “Show Surface Hydrophobics.”  This colors all the hydrophobic residues of CBS 
pink.  Are there a lot or a few surface exposed hydrophobic amino acids?  Does this make 
sense?  For what purpose could the protein use surface exposed hydrophobic resides? 
There a quite a few hydrophobic residues on the surface of CBS.  Most of them are 
scattered throughout the surface and are not found in distinct clusters.  This is typical of 
most soluble proteins.  It allows them to remain stable, and to sometimes interact with other 
proteins or to bind hydrophobic ligands. 
CBS is normally found in a tetrameric or octameric conformation. The wild-type CBS 
protein uses some of the hydrophobic amino acids on its surface, along with the domain 
missing in the mutant protein, to bind other CBS molecules. 

Back to the gel data. 

17. Do you expect the mutant enzyme to be active? Why or why not? 
Unclear from data. It depends on what the function(s) are of the domain of the protein 
that was lost in the mutant.  

18. The in-gel activity assay actually indicates that the mutant protein is active. What do you think 
is the function of the missing domain? 
It is possible that the missing domain is only responsible for making tetramers and 
octamers. It could also have function that we have not analyzed yet.  

19. Suppose a colleague in the lab next door has figured out that the mutant protein is active in the 
cell all the time, while the wild type protein is active only some of the time. What conclusion 
might you draw from this information in combination with your data? 
The domain missing in the mutant appears to also have regulatory function that allows 
the protein to be in either active or inactive conformation.
