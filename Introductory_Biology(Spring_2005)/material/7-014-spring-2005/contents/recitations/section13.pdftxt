Biogeochemical Cycles—Carbon and Energy Metabolism 

A.  Carbon and Energy Options 

1.	 What two things are required by every organism for growth? 

2.	 With respect to how organisms acquire organic carbon, we classify them into two groups. What 
are those groups? 

3.	 What metabolic process is common to all organisms? What is the result of this process? 

4.	

In addition to the process in 3, autotrophs also perform another function. What is it? 

5.	 Fill in the table below with the various options for life we have encountered in 7.014. You need 
to indicate conditions and resulting processes, as well as the sources of carbon and electrons for 
each process.

B.  Problem Solving 

As an aspiring biogeochemist, you set out on an ambitious search for previously uncharacterized 
microorganisms. You go down to your local swamp and return with 3 different bacteria.  
You’re not sure what these bacteria need in order to grow, but since the swamp is pretty stinky you try 
growing them under anaerobic conditions in buffered water that has CO2 and H2S bubbled through it. 
You grow the three bacterial species in both the light and in the dark and observe the following.   

species #1 
grows 

species #2 
species #3 
NO growth  NO growth 

dark 

light 

grows 

grows 

NO growth 

1.	 From this data, you conclude that strain #1 is a chemosynthetic autotroph. 

i) What is the source of electrons for this metabolism? 

ii) What is the source of carbon for this metabolism? 

2. 	 What type of metabolism does strain #2 employ to make energy? 

i) What is the source of electrons for this metabolism? 

ii) What is the source of carbon for this metabolism? 

3.	 You put strain #3 together with strain #1 under anaerobic conditions in water that has CO2 and 
H2S bubbled through it (the same conditions as above).  Now both strain 1 and strain 3 grow in 
the light and in the dark. 

i) What type of metabolism used by strain #3?


ii) In strain #3, what is the source of electrons for this metabolism?


iii) In strain #3, what is the final electron acceptor for this metabolism?


4. 	 Done with your experiment, you stop bubbling CO2 and H2S through the water after a day of 
growing  species #1 and species #3 together.  Surprisingly, both #1 and #3 continue growing 
indefinitely.  Explain this observation.   

In 1640 Jan Baptista van Helmont, a Flemish physician and chemist, carried out the following 
experiment about plant growth: 

He took a pot of soil, and weighed the soil. He then took a willow sapling and weighed it. He planted 
the sapling and watered the plant for 5 years. After that time, he weighed the willow tree and he 
weighed the remaining soil. These were his observations:

5 years later

+169 lb 

5.	 By how much do you suspect the weight of the soil decreased? Why? 
90% (180 lbs) 
85% (170 lbs) 
50% (100 lbs) 
10%  (20 lbs) 
1%  (2 lbs) 
0.1% (0.2 lbs) 
0.01% (0.02 lbs) 

6. 	 Bacteria that use O2 as an electron acceptor in respiration produce more ATP per molecule of 
- as an electron acceptor. Explain why.  
glucose than those that use NO3
