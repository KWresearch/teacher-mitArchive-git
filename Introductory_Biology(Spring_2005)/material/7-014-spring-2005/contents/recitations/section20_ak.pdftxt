An activated B cell undergoes cell division and produces many daughter cells.  Some daughter cells will 
function as B cells, some will function as plasma cells and other will become memory cells.   
4.	 Assume that an activated B cell undergos somatic mutation and produces two different B cells each 
with a slightly altered version of the antibody.  This event occurs early in the immune response (i.e. 
when antigen was present in the organism).  Mutation A makes the antibody-antigen interaction 
stronger, mutation B makes the antibody-antigen interaction much weaker.   
__ Yes__ 
i) Would you expect memory cells derived from the original activated B cell? 
ii) Would you expect memory cells derived from the daughter B cell with mutation A (antibody (cid:173)
__ Yes__ 
antigen interaction stronger)? 	
 
iii) Would you expect memory cells derived from the daughter B cell with mutation B (antibody (cid:173)
__ No__ 
antigen interaction much weaker)? 
Explain your answers. 
With antigen still present, any B cell that binds antigen and internalizes it will present antigenic peptides 
to TH cells and thus be able to be activated.  The better the antibody is at binding antigen, the more likely 
activation of that B cell will occur.  Therefore you should see memory B cells derived from the original B 
cell, and from the daughters carrying mutation A.  Because the daughter cells carrying mutation B do not 
bind antibody as well, they are less likely to be activated and they may not be represented in the memory 
cell population. 
B.  Immunology and Immunizations 
The varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the infectious agent that results in chickenpox, a common childhood 
illness that causes itchy red spots on the skin.  Contracting VZV as a child is relatively benign, but can 
present serious health issues when contracted as an adult. 
1. 	 How does a VZV infected cell signal the immune system?  How are the infected cells specifically 
eliminated from the body? 
Once a body cell is infected, peptides specific to VZV are presented on class I MHC molecules on the 
surface of the infected cell.  Some cytotoxic T cells will recognize the MHC I/ VZV peptide complex as 
non-self, become activated and destroy the VZV-infected cells. 
2. 	 Over the course of a lifetime, the average person is exposed to VZV many times, yet usually only 
displays symptoms once. What is the immune system mechanism that results in lifetime 
resistance? 
Once infected with VZV, the individual mounts a full immune response and eventually clears the virus. 
Part of the immune response is the generation of memory B and T cells.  Upon re-exposure to VZV, 
the immune system is primed with cells proven effective against VZV.  The secondary immune 
response is faster and more effective and eliminates the virus before symptoms of VZV occur. 
As of September 1999 any child entering kindergarten must have had chickenpox or received a new 
vaccine against VZV. 
3. 	 Present an argument in support of this vaccination campaign. 
An argument for vaccination is to reduce pain and discomfort in young children, and ensure that no 
one enters adulthood susceptible to the disease. 
4. 	 Present an argument opposed to this vaccination campaign. 
An argument against vaccination is driven by the concern that the vaccine may not provide lifetime 
immunity against VZV.  It is not clear that whether the lifetime immunity of individuals is due to 
contracting the disease, or whether subsequent exposure to the VZV virus (from siblings, classmates, 
etc.) acts as an immune system booster.  If all children receive the vaccine, then after several years 
there will be no secondary exposures and thus no boost to the immune system.  The fear is then that 
these children reach adulthood they may be exposed to VZV (not every country will vaccinate all their 
children) and no longer have immunity.  The consequences of contracting VZV as an adult are 
unpleasant at best and life-threatening in some cases.

2. 	 Each of the following mutations alters the binding of the antigen to the antibody.  Explain in terms 
of the change in interactions why the binding of the Phosphorylcholine to the antibody has 
remained the same, been made stronger, or been made weaker.

1:  Both trp and leu have non-polar side chains, so the hydrophobic and van der Waals forces 
have not change. 
2:  Both arg and lys have positively charged side chains so the ionic bond remains intact. 
However, the three dimensional shape of the mutant antibody somehow allows better binding of 
the antigen. 
3:  A charged amino acid has been changed to a polar amino acid, therefore the ionic bond is 
replaced with a weaker hydrogen bond. 
4:  Tyr can form a hydrogen bond, but phe can not, therefore the antibody-antigen interaction is 
weaker. 
3.	 Can any of these mutations be due to a single base pair substitution?  
If so, give one possibility. 
Trp ---> Leu, UGG ---> UUG 

Glu ---> Gln, GAA ---> CAA OR GAG ---> CAG 

Arg ---> Lys, AGA ---> AAA OR AGG ---> AAG 

Tyr ---> Phe, UAU ---> UUU OR UAC ---> UUC
