Diploid Genetics and Chromosomal Inheritance 

 

 
 

•r - white allele. Recessive phenotype of white eyes. 
Cross 2 is: Rr X Rr ----> 3:1 red:white. 

A.  Diploid Genetics 
For each set of data below, determine the genotype of the parents in cross 1. Where it applies, indicate 
which phenotypes are dominant and which are recessive. 
1. Mice I 
a) cross 1: red-eyed mouse ____________  	X  white-eyed mouse ____________  

all red-eyed 

gives F1: 
 
cross 2: red-eyed F1  X red-eyed F1
 
gives F2: 
	36 red-eyed 
 
 
13 white-eyed 
 
 
 
Cross 1: red eyes X white eyes gives all red eyes – a likely model is that eye color is controlled by one gene 
that has 2 alleles producing two phenotypes, red and white eyes. The red eyed phenotype is likely 
dominant. Therefore, choose appropriate symbols (one letter per gene, capital letter for allele with 
dominant phenotype): 
•R - red allele. Dominant phenotype of red eyes. 
Then:  Cross 1 is: RR X rr ----> all Rr (all red eyes). 
The predictions agree with the data. 
b) cross 1: long-eared mouse ____________  X  short-eared mouse ____________  

gives F1: 
12 long-eared 

 
 
10 short-eared 
 
 
cross 2: long-eared F1  X long-eared F1

 
gives F2: 
	36 long-eared 
 
 
13 short-eared 
 
 
 
Cross 1: long ears X short ears gives some long and some short ears – a likely model is that ear length is 

controlled by one gene with 2 alleles resulting in two phenotypes, long ears and short ears. From this data, 

we cannot determine which allele has the dominant phenotype. 

Cross 2: long ears X long ears gives some long and some short ears – a likely model is that long ears is the 

dominant phenotype. Therefore, the appropriate symbols are: L - long ears  and l - short ears . 

Then: Cross 1 is: Ll X llÆ1:1 long ears: short ears 
Cross 2 is: Ll X Ll Æ3:1 long ears: short ears 

The predictions agree with the data. 

2. Flowers 
cross 1: blue-flowered plant ____________ 	X  white-flowered plant ____________ 

 
gives F1: 
all pale-blue-flowered  

cross 2: pale-blue F1  X pale-blue F1
 
 
gives F2: 	
27 blue 49 pale-blue 
24 white 
Cross 1: blue flowers X white flowers gives all pale blue flowers – a plausible model is that color is 
controlled by one gene with 2 alleles, resulting in blue and white flowers, and that neither phenotype is 
dominant.  This is an example of co- dominance. Then, BB- blue, B'B - white, BB'- pale blue phenotypes 
respectively. 
Then: Cross 1 is: BB X B'B'Æall BB', pale blue flowers. 
Cross 2 is: BB' X BB'Æ1:2:1 BB, blue flowers: BB', pale blue flowers: B'B', white flowers. 
The predictions agree with the data. 

 











 

3. Blood Type 
Blood type is determined by one gene that has three alleles: 
IA - allele associated with the A phenotype, co-dominant with the B phenotype 
IB - allele associated with the B phenotype, co-dominant with the A phenotype 
IO - allele associated with the O phenotype, recessive to both the A and B phenotype 
a) cross 1: person, type A blood ____________  X  person with type B ____________ 
 
all type AB blood 
gives F1: 	
cross 2: type AB F1  X  type AB F1
2 type A 

gives F2: 	
 
4 type AB 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1 type B 

 
 
 
Then: 

Cross 1 is: IAIA X IBIB Æall type IAIB

Cross 2 is: IAIB  X IAIBÆ1:2:1  types A:AB:B (note skewed ratio with small number of progeny)


b) cross 1: type A blood ____________  X  type B ____________ 
2 type A blood 

gives F1: 	
 
3 type AB blood 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1 type B blood 
2 type O blood 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
Then: 

Cross 1 is: IAIO  X  IBIO----> 1:1:1:1 types A:B:AB:O (note skewed ratio with small number of progeny) 

The predictions agree with the data. 


 
 

4. Mice II
cross 1: tail-less mouse ____________  X  normal mouse ____________  
10 tail-less 

gives  F1: 	
 
 
 
 
9 normal 
cross 2:  tail-less F1  X tail-less F1
	10 normal 
gives F2: 
 
 
 
 
 
21 tail-less 
 
 
dead

 
9
 
 
 
Tail-lessness and lethality are controlled by one gene with two alleles: 
T allele - dominant tail-less phenotype; recessive lethal phenotype 
t allele - recessive normal-tail phenotype; dominant viable phenotype 
therefore: 
TT - tail-less and dead 

Tt - tail-less and alive 

tt - normal-tail and alive 

Then: 

Cross 1 is: Tt X ttÆ 1:1  Tt (tail-less) : tt (normal)

Cross 2 is: Tt X TtÆ1:2:1 normal:tail-less:dead 

The predictions agree with the data. 

Note that usually in such problems the number of dead animals is not reported, but needs to be inferred 

from the rest of the data (i.e. “missing” phenotype or numbers of progeny, i.e. ratios that don’t make 

sense).  


















B.  Chromosomes and Recombination 

1.  What is the physical basis of the genetic inheritance? 
Genes are fragments of DNA that encode when, where, and what product (protein or functional RNA) is to 
be made. Genes are assembled together into chromosomes. During cell division chromosomal segregation 
can be observed with a microscope. Chromosomes are inherited from parents.  Thus, sexually reproducing 
diploid organisms get one copy (allele) of each gene from each parent and pass one allele on to each of 
their offspring at random. These alleles are passed on the chromosomes inherited from each parent. 

2.  Why is sexual reproduction a powerful source of variation? 
Sexual reproduction allows for great diversity and fast change (through bringing together genetic 
information from two parents). Gamete production in meiosis (2nÆ4nÆ2nÆn) allows for reshuffling of 
parental genetic information through independent segregation of chromosomes. 

3.  Why was it evolutionarily advantageous to develop the ability to recombine chromosomes? 
Recombination—the exchange of parts of chromosomes between homologous pairs of chromosomes— 
increases the rate of reshuffling of parental genetic information compared with the independent 
segregation of chromosomes alone. 
Faster reshuffling of genetic information means more variation in the population. In turn, that leads to 
better survival for a species because, for any change in the environmental conditions (selective pressure), it 
increases the chances that an individual will arise that is better suited to the new conditions (selective 
advantage). This individual and the individual’s offspring will have be more likely to survive and procreate 
under the new conditions, and, thus, greater proportion of the population will end up with the 
advantageous allele in the future. 

Think about the following question for next time (we will talk about it in Section 16): 
Recombination can occur anywhere along the length of the chromosome. However, we have been relying 
on the fact that genes are inherited as discreet units. How do we reconcile these two things? (Hint: think 
about what usually is the difference between two alleles of the same gene.)
