1.  What do the arrows in the diagram represent? 

2.  Why are the arrows of different sizes? 

3.  How does the energy enter the ecosystem? Is it converted in any way before it is used in the ecosystem?

5.	 Starting with 106 kcal/yr of GPP and given the following values, estimate the values of each of the flows 
from part 4 assuming steady-state conditions. 

NPP

= 50%
For plants  :  net production efficiency 
= 
GPP 

For the herbivores:  exploitation efficiency = 

ingestion 	
production  from previous trophic level 
assimilation
= 25%
assimilation efficiency  =	
ingestion 
production 
= 20% 
assimilation 
For the carnivores: exploitation efficiency = 90% (no reference) 
 
 
 
assimilation efficiency = 75% 
production efficiency = 5% 
 
 
 

 

 

 

production efficiency  = 

= 20%

6.	 The carbon in respiration (R) flows can be used by other organisms, but the energy in the respiration (R) 
flows cannot. Both the carbon and energy of all other flows can be used by other organisms. What is 
different about the R flows?

B.  Non-Steady State. 

Now consider the non-steady-state. Suppose you remove 50% of the herbivores at time = A. You then measure 
the plant-associated flows and find the following:
