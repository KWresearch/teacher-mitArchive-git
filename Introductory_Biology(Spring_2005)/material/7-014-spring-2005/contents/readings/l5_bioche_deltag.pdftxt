G and Keq


For  the  chemical  equilibrium :  

reactants  

products

The  equilibrium  constant ,  Keq is defined as:  K  = 
eq 

[products]
[reactants]

at equilibrium.

Where [] symbolizes concentration, for example,  [products] indicates concentration of products. 

The equation that relates the free energy of the reaction, ΔG, to the standard free energy, 
ΔGo'  and the concentrations of reactants and products is: 
⎛ [products] ⎞ 
ΔG = ΔGo '  +  RT ln 
⎠  Equation (1)
⎝ [reactants] 

where:	

R= the universal gas constant

T=  the  temperature  in  oK


i f T =  25 ˚C 

RT  =  0 .59

if T  =  37 ˚C RT  =  0.61 

kcal

Under  Standard Conditions  where:  [products] = 1 M and [reactants] = 1 M  (M = moles/liter) 
ΔG = ΔGo' 
(Equation 1) becomes: 
therefore, the Δ Go'  of the reaction is the free energy change (ΔG) under standard 
conditions. 

At  equilibrium , ΔG = 0, and equation (1) becomes:

Keq < 1 

Significance of Keq: 
ΔGo'  has negative value, therefore reaction ⇒ is possible. 
ΔGo'  has positive value, therefore reaction ⇒ is possible if [react] > [prod]. 
ΔGo'  has large negative value, therefore reaction ⇒ is irreversible. 
ΔGo'  has large positive value, therefore reaction ⇒ cannot occur.

Enzyme s

(This handout is designed to supplement the coverage of enzymes in Purves e t  a l .)


A catalyst is a molecule that increases the rate of a reaction but is not the substrate or

product of that reaction.


Enzymes  are usually proteins that catalyze chemical reactions in cells  (the exception is

catalytic RNA).


A substrate is a molecule upon which an enzyme acts to yield a product.


The part of the enzyme that binds substrate is called the active site .


Consider the reaction:  A (substrate) ------>  B (product)

A graph of the free energy against the reaction progress is shown below:

Reaction Progress 

ΔG is negative overall for forward reaction. The free energy of this reaction is not changed 
by the presence of the enzyme, BUT the enzyme can speed up the reaction by lower the Ea. 

Enzyme Mechanisms 
In a reaction like that above, Ea could represent an energetically unfavorable transitional

state that the substrate must obtain before forming product.  Enzymes can lower the Ea by

stabilizing the substrate in that transitional state and thus speed up the reaction.


For a reaction involving two substrates:  A  +  B  --->  C,

the enzyme may increase the local concentration of A and B and drive the reaction 

forward.

Kinetics of enzyme reactions 

One way to study an enzyme is to measure the formation of the product.  If you were to 
perform an experiment under defined conditions at a given concentration of substrate and 
enzyme you could plot a time course of the enzyme catalyzed reaction.

time elapsed 

Enzymes catalyze both forward and reverse reactions.  In the reaction S -->P, the enzyme 
converts substrate (S) to product (P).  Initially, the concentration of P is small and the net 
reaction is S -->P.  As [P] increases, the rate of the reaction S -->P decreases until the rate of 
the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction.  At this point the reaction is in 
equilibrium .  

To measure the kinetic properties of a given enzyme, you must perform many 
experiments like the one above, holding the enzyme concentration constant and varying 
the substrate concentrations. The initial reaction velocity at each substrate concentration is 
measured, and the data from all the experiments is used to plot the initial reaction 
velocity ,  Vo,  as a function of substrate concentration [S].  An example is found below.

Velocity is dependent on [S], but remember this graph was generated at one  enzyme  
concentration.  If more enzyme was added, the reaction velocity would increase. 
The velocity asymptotically approaches a maximum as [S] --> ∞ . 

W h y   i s n ' t   t h e   g r a p h   l i n e a r ?  
As [S] gets large, the enzyme becomes saturated.  Every enzyme molecule is complexed 
with substrate and since the amount of enzyme used in this series of experiments is fixed, 
the rate asymptotically approaches a maximum. 

NOTE: the two preceding graphs look very similar, but represent different things.  It is 
important to understand the difference between an individual reaction: [P] vs. t  (from 
which you get Vo) and a kinetic graph of many such reactions: Vo vs. [S]. 

Enzymes that display this kinetic behavior can be modeled mathematically as was first 
shown by Michaelis and Menten in 1913: 

Michaelis-Menten Enzyme Kinetics 

For an enzymatic reaction: 
k 1 
k3

E + S 

ES 

E + P

The symbols represent (in our example): 
E 
enzyme  
substrate 
S  
enzyme-substrate complex 
ES 
product 
P 
k1 
the rate at which E combines with S to form ES 
k2 
the rate at which ES can dissociate into E and S 
k3 
the rate at which ES can proceed to form E and P 

Michaelis and Menten modeled the catalytic rate of enzymes under steady-state conditions 
where  the  concentration  of  ES  remains  unchanged  over  time  while  the  concentrations  of  
starting materials and products are changing.  At steady state the rate of ES formation 
equals the rate of ES breakdown.  The following conditions are assumed in this model. 

1) The uncatalyzed rate of S ---> P is negligible (the reaction does not go without enzyme). 

2) Because the [S] is far greater than the [E], the amount of substrate bound by enzyme is 
negligible compare to the total [S].  Also assumed is that [S] does not vary with time (this 
reaction is under examination for a brief moment), and the reaction rate remains the 
same .  

3)  The reverse reaction (P ---> S) does not occur.

Given the above assumptions and approximations, the dependence of Vo on [S] can be 
derived  mathematically .  (For  further  information ,  see  "Biochemistry"  4th  edition  by  
Stryer; pp 192-193)

Three cases will illustrate how this equation behaves. 

CASE 1:  [S] very large ([S]>>KM => Enzyme is saturated with substrate) 
⎛ [S] ⎞
in this case [S] + KM  ≈  [S], so (1) becomes: 
= k 3 [E]tot ⎝ [S] ⎠ 
= k 3 [E]tot 
or: 
This is the rate at a large substrate concentration - (the maximal rate) which is called Vmax  
Vmax=k3[E]tot

back-reaction can be ignored.

CASE 2:  [S] small ([S]<<KM  => linear range) 
in this case [S] + KM  ≈  KM  so (2) becomes: 
So, at low [S], Vo  is linearly proportional to [S].

KM is defined as the [S] that results in half-maximal reaction rate.

SIGNIFICANCE OF KM and Vmax  

Vmax  and KM are the two parameters which define the kinetic behavior of an enzyme as a 
function of [S].

Vmax  is a rate of reaction . It will have units of:

Vmax depends on the structure the enzyme itself and the concentration of enzyme present. 

KM is a the concentration substrate required to approach the maximum reaction velocity  -

KM depends only on the structure of the enzyme and is independent of enzyme concentration. 

Measuring KM and Vmax  
The quantities KM and  Vmax  are experimentally determined and different for each

enzyme. Once you have an assay for enzyme activity, you can determine these

parameters.  You can estimate KM and  Vmax  from the graph of initial velocity versus [S].

1) Run a series of reactions each with a single [E]tot , varying [S], and measure V0.

2) Graph V0 vs. [S].

3) Estimate Vmax  from asymptote.

4) Calculate Vmax/2

5) read KM from graph.
