7.014  Lectures 16 &17:  The Biosphere & Carbon and Energy Metabolism 
Simplified Summary of Microbial Metabolism 
The metabolism of different types of organisms drives the biogeochemical cycles of the biosphere.  Balanced oxidation and 
reduction reactions keep the system from “running down”. 
All living organisms can be ordered into two groups1,  autotrophs and heterotrophs, according to what they use as their 
carbon source.  Within these groups the metabolism of organisms can be further classified according to their source of 
energy and electrons. 
Autotrophs:  Those organisms get their energy from light (photoautotrophs) or reduced inorganic compounds 
(chemoautotrophs), and their carbon from CO2 through one of the following processes: 
Photosynthesis (aerobic) — Light energy used to reduce CO2 to organic carbon using H2O as a source of electrons.            

O2 evolved from splitting H2O.  (Plants, algae, cyanobacteria)

Bacterial Photosynthesis (anaerobic) — Light energy used to reduce CO2 to organic carbon (same as photosynthesis). 
H2S is used as the electron donor instead of H2O.  (e.g. purple sulfur bacteria) 
Chemosynthesis (aerobic) — Energy from the oxidation of inorganic molecules is used to reduce CO2 to organic 

carbon (bacteria only). 

e.g. sulfur oxidizing bacteria H2S → S → SO4-2
+ → NO2  → NO3 (cid:173)
-
      nitrifying bacteria  NH4
iron oxidizing bacteria  Fe+2  → Fe+3 
methane oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs)  CH4  → CO2 
Heterotrophs:  These organisms get their energy and carbon from organic compounds (supplied by autotrophs through the 
food web) through one or more of the following processes: 
Aerobic Respiration (aerobic) ⎯ Oxidation of organic compounds to CO2 and H2O, yielding energy for biological work.  
O2 is the final electron acceptor (All aerobic organisms -- eukaryotes and prokaryotes). 
Fermentation (anaerobic) — Glucose converted to pyruvate (yielding energy) which is then converted to a variety of end 
products (e.g. yeast oxidize glucose to ethanol, and anaerobic muscle oxidizes it to lactic acid).  Glucose is not 
oxidized all the way to CO2  as it is in aerobic respiration (eukaryotes and prokaryotes). 
Anaerobic Respiration (anaerobic) ⎯ Oxidation of organic compounds to CO2 yielding energy for biological work.  Final 
electron acceptor is not O2, but rather NO3-, SO4
-2  etc. (prokaryotes only) 
denitrifying bacteria  NO3- → NO (g) → N2O (g) → N2 (g) 
-2  → H2S 
sulfate reducing bacteria  SO4
methanogens  CO2  → CH4 
Thus all life is run on the free energy difference between O2 and organic carbon (glucose).  The autotrophs synthesize 
glucose using solar or chemical energy, which is broken down through respiration (either their own or that of the organisms 
that eat them) to provide the energy necessary for “biological work”.  Redox reactions are central to all of these energy 
transformations, and the resulting flows of electrons manifest themselves in the form of biogeochemical cycles.  The 
activities of bacteria keep these cycles moving.  For example, the chemosynthetic bacteria oxidize many essential elements 
in the process of getting the energy required to reduce CO2.  Certain anaerobic bacteria in turn reduce these compounds in 
the process of anaerobic  respiration ⎯ i.e., they use them as an electron acceptor in the absence of oxygen.  This keeps 
the element cycles flowing and keeps the system from “running down”. 

1  This summary is over-simplified.  There are microbes that don’t fit into this scheme.   Some organisms are “mixotrophs” ⎯ i.e., they 
can switch between different modes of metabolism depending on the circumstances.  Also, there are associations between organisms 
⎯  i.e., “symbioses” which behave as a single organism with multiple modes of metabolism.  Finally, there are microorganisms that 
have managed to break out of this general framework.  Basically, if it can work thermodynamically, Nature has created a microbe that 
can do it.
