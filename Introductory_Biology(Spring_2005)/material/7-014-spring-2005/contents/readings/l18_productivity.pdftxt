PRODUCTIVITY: THE “METABOLISM” OF ECOSYSTEMS 

Ecologists use the term “productivity” to refer to the process through which an assemblage of 
organisms (e.g. a trophic level or ecosystem assimilates carbon.  Primary producers 
(autotrophs) do this through photosynthesis; Secondary producers (heterotrophs) do it through 
the assimilation of the organic carbon in their food.  Remember that all organic carbon in the food 
web is ultimately derived from primary production. 

DEFINITIONS 

Primary Productivity: Rate of conversion of CO2 to organic carbon (photosynthesis) per unit 
surface area of the earth, expressed either in terns of weight of carbon, or the equivalent calories 
g C m-2 year 
-1 
e.g., 
Kcal m-2 year 
-1

Primary Production: Same as primary productivity, but usually expressed for a whole ecosystem 
-1
e.g., 
tons year  for a lake, cornfield, forest, etc. 

NET vs. GROSS: 

For plants: Some of the organic carbon generated in plants through photosynthesis (using solar 
energy) is oxidized back to CO2 (releasing energy) through the respiration of the plants – RA. 

Gross Primary Production:  (GPP) = Total amount of CO2 reduced to organic carbon by the plants
 per unit time 

Autotrophic Respiration: (RA) = Total amount of organic carbon that is respired (oxidized to CO2)
 by plants per unit time 

Net Primary Production (NPP) = GPP – RA

The amount of organic carbon produced by plants that is not consumed by their own respiration.

It is the increase in the plant biomass in the absence of herbivores.


For an entire ecosystem: Some of the NPP of the plants is consumed (and respired) by

herbivores and decomposers and oxidized back to CO2 (RH).  The amount of carbon that is left is

called:


Net Community Production (NCP) = Organic carbon produced through photosynthesis that is not 

lost through RA or RH.


Thus: 

NPP = GPP - RA 
NCP = GPP - RA - RH = NPP - RH

•  Some of this goes to the detritus food web, some goes to respiration
