Biochemical Genetics


Biochemical Genetics


Introduction and Background 

We have learned that proteins can act as enzymes and catalyze all sorts of reactions in the cell. 
We discussed a biochemical approach to understanding cellular processes by purifying 
enzymes, determining their structure, and then studying the reactions they catalyze.  Often 
though this type of study does not answer the question, "what does this protein do within the 
organism?"  One approach to this question would be to remove the protein being studied and 
determine how this affects the organism.  But, is this possible? 

The information required to make an enzyme is encoded as a gene in the DNA of the 
organism.  In general, one gene corresponds to one polypeptide (a gene can also correspond to 
an RNA, but this is not relevant to the discussion at hand).  This correspondence and advances 
in DNA technology allow researchers to create an organism that lacks a particular protein by 
removing the DNA that encodes that protein.  In effect, a specific mutant organism can be 
created and by studying this mutant we can study the effects of removing a single protein. 

Even before this was a possibility, genetics played a key role in understanding many basic 
cellular processes.  If you wanted to study olfaction but you had not identified any of the 
proteins involved, how could you begin?  Because one gene corresponds to one protein and 
the genotype of an organism is often reflected in its phenotype, you could start by finding 
mutants that can not detect odors.  The assumption would be that each mutant carries a 
change in the DNA that encodes a particular protein important in olfaction.  The altered 
protein could have an altered function or be so changed that it no longer functions at all.  The 
change in the DNA sequence is called a mutation, and the cell or organism carrying a mutation 
is called a mutant. 

Mutants with a disruption in the olfaction process would all have the same phenotype, an 
inability to sense odors.  This is true even if each mutant had an alteration in a different gene. 
For example, assume that the ability to perceive odors requires three different proteins and 
protein 1 is encoded by gene1, protein 2 is encoded by gene 2, etc.  The phenotype of an 
organism with a mutation in gene 1 would be the same as the phenotype of an organism with 
a mutation in a gene 2; neither of these mutants would be able to perceive an odor. 

Thus even without any knowledge of the genes or the proteins involved in a particular cellular 
process, we can begin to study it by collecting mutants that all display the same phenotype. 

A Model System 

For this introductory illustration of biochemical genetics we will begin with a model system. 
Model systems are organisms that can be easily manipulated in a laboratory environment. 
Widely used as model organisms are single-celled eukaryotes of the yeast family.  These 
yeasts, like Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe are associated with the making 
of beer and bread.  These cells are easily and quickly grown in a laboratory, can live in either a 
haploid or a diploid state, and can reproduce sexually or asexually.  Yeast cells can be treated 
with chemicals or irradiated to increase the mutation rate, and they can be rather easily 
convinced to accept exogenous DNA.  To explore more about yeast see:

The yeast life cycle.
Yeast cells reproduce asexually simply through mitosis where the mother cell divides to 
produce two identical daughter cells.  If the yeast cell is diploid, it can instead enter a meiotic 
pathway and produce four haploid cells or "spores".  Interestingly, each of these haploid 
spores can enter a mitotic cycle and indefinitely produce identical haploid daughter cells.  Two 
haploid yeast cells can fuse or "mate" to create a new diploid cell. 

Growing yeast cells. 
Yeast cells can be grown easily in the laboratory.  Wild-type yeast cells are prototrophs.  This 
means that they can synthesize all the necessary cellular components de novo if provided with 
some basic carbohydrates and salts.  The basic required carbohydrates and salts are supplied 
as minimal medium. Yeast cells can be grown in test tubes containing liquid minimal medium or 
on petri plates containing a solid form of minimal medium.  A single yeast cell can only be 
seen with a microscope, but a single cell can divide into 108 identical cells in 48 hours. 108 cells 
are enough to turn a tube of liquid medium cloudy, and if the tube of medium is allowed to 
settle, a coating of cells is visible at the bottom of the tube.  When a single cell divides on solid 
medium, all the daughter cells stay grouped together. 108 cells grouped together form a colony 
about as big as the following dot. 
•

Yeast cells can also be grown in or on rich medium. Rich medium contains carbohydrates and 
salts and all the amino acids and other nutrients that yeast cells could need.  When presented 
with amino acid supplements (or other nutrients), yeast cells do not invest cellular energy to 
make them de novo, but instead scavenge them from the medium. 

When a mutation occurs in the genome of a yeast cell that eliminates a protein required for 
biosynthesis, the mutant yeast cell can no longer grow on mininal medium.  Such mutants are 
called auxotrophs.  If the mutation damaged a gene encoding an enzyme needed for arginine 
synthesis, then the mutant cell would not grow on minimal medium but would grow on 
minimal media that was supplemented with arginine.  Alternatively, if the mutation damaged 
a gene encoding an enzyme needed for nicotinic acid synthesis, then the mutant cell would not 
grow on minimal medium but would grow on minimal medium that was supplemented with 
nicotinic acid.  Both the arginine auxotroph and the nicotonic acid auxotroph could grow on 
rich medium. 

Making and Identifying Mutants 

Mutations like those discussed above are naturally occurring due errors in mitosis or meiosis. 
However, to study a biochemical pathway using genetics, many mutants are needed.  To this 
end, wild-type yeast cells can be mutangenized by irradiation or with chemicals that damage 
DNA.  In a mutagenesis, the starting cells are usually haploid, and are treated with levels of 
mutagen such that most cells carry a single mutation.  Why would you want to begin with a 
haploid strain? 

You are hoping to identify cells that are missing a gene encoding a protein important in the 
pathway that you are studying.  In a haploid cell, a mutation in a gene that results in a non-
functioning protein is likely to have an effect. If you began with diploid cells, both copies of a 
gene would need to be mutated to prevent protein function.  In a diploid, a single mutation 
could be masked by the normal copy of the gene because the phenotype of the diploid would 
be wild-type. 

Depending upon the process being studied, creativity and insight is needed to accurately 
predict what phenotype your mutants should have and identify interesting mutants in a large 
population.  Take the olfaction example for instance.  You might begin such a study using fruit 
3


flies; and then search for mutants that are unable to negotiate a maze to find the target fruit. 
You may well collect flies that can not sense odors, but among them are flies that can sense 
odor perfectly but are poor fliers. 

Let's outline a "mutant hunt" with a straight-forward example.  Say we want to study arginine 
biosynthesis in a yeast model system.  We begin with a haploid, wild-type strain.  This strain 
can grow on minimal medium.  We mutangenize many of these cells in liquid and then 
transfer (or plate) the treated cells onto solid agar medium† in petri plates.  What type of media 
would you use for these solid agar plates? 

For reasons that will become clear, we plate our mutagenized cells on rich medium and many 
colonies are seen two days later.  How do we know which of the many colonies contain cells 
that are defective in arginine biosynthesis? Remember that the mutants of interest to us carry 
defects in arginine biosynthesis and can not grow unless the medium contains arginine.  So we 
simply need to determine which of the colonies growing on rich medium have cells that can 
not grow in the absence or arginine.  Hum…? 

Replica Plating, Screening and Selecting 

In a real experiment, you may have 10,000 or more colonies to test, so the concept may be 
simple, but the execution would be tedious and time consuming.  A technique called replica 
plating developed by Esther and Joshua Lederberg, makes it possible to quickly screen many 
colonies for mutants of interest.  The basic principle is the same as that of the rubber stamp. 
Regardless of the deficiency, most cells form colonies on the rich medium plates, these plates 
are called non-selective. We just need to copy those colonies onto plates that can distinguish cells 
with mutations in the arginine synthesis pathway from others.  The non-selective, rich 
medium plate serves as a master plate.  A sterile transfer device*, such as a piece of velvet is 
gently pressed onto the master plate.  The loops and threads of the material pick up a small 
number of cells from each colony on the master plate.  All the colonies and their spatial 
relationship to each other are now represented on the velvet.  The velvet is then applied to 
consecutive replica plates.  Some of these replica plates are selective and mutants of interest fail 
to grow.  In our case, selective plates lack arginine.

*The prototype of the transfer device was the application pad that came in Esther Lederberg's powder compact.

In such a screen, we can identify mutants that have lost the ability to grow with out arginine. 
These cells will not form a colony on the replica plate but can be retrieved from the master 
plate by comparing the position of the colonies on the two plates. 

We could follow the same experimental outline if our mutant hunt was designed to identify 
mutants that had acquired a new ability, say resistance to anti-fungal drugs.  In this case the 
non-selective medium would not contain drug, but the selective medium would.  On the drug 
containing replica plate we could select only for cells that had gained the ability to grow in the 
presence of drug. 

These procedures would be repeated until a large collection of mutants had been identified. 
Remember that all our mutants will have the same phenotype, in our example they require 
arginine, even if each mutant has an alteration in a different gene.  Each mutant was 
individually isolated, and we will randomly call them the arg1 mutant, the arg2 mutant, the 
arg3 mutant, etc.  Until we know more, we will assume that the arg1 mutant has a mutation in 
the arg1 gene and is defective in the ARG1 protein, and that the arg2 mutant has a mutation in 
the arg2 gene and is defective in the ARG2 protein 

Analyzing the Collection of Mutants 

You now have a collection of haploid mutants that each carry only one mutation.  You might 
begin by asking the following questions: 

1. Is the phenotype of each mutant dominant or recessive?
2. Which of the mutants have mutations in the same gene?
3. Which of the mutants have mutations in different genes?
4. How many different genes are mutated in this population of mutants?
5. Do these genes encode proteins that function in a particular order, and if so, in what
order do the proteins function? 

Each of these questions can be answered using one of three tests, a test of recessivity, a test of 
complementation, or a test of epistasis. 

Test of Recessivity 

The first step is to determine if the phenotype of each mutant is recessive.  This information is 
vital in interpreting the other tests.  Recall that a recessive phenotype is a phenotype that is not 
seen in a heterozygote.  In our case, a heterozygote would be a diploid yeast cell made from a 
haploid mutant and a haploid wild-type (wt or +) cell.  This diploid cell would carry a single 
mutation.  If the phenotype of the mutant is recessive, then this diploid cell will appear wild-
type.  If the phenotype of the mutant is dominant, then this diploid cell would be the same as 
the mutant.  In general, recessive phenotypes correspond to loss-of-function mutations. 

For example, we could take our haploid arg1 mutant, mate it with a wild-type haploid cell, 
and prevent the resulting diploid cell from undergoing a meiotic division.  The arg1/+ diploid 
cell will then multiply by mitotic cell divisions. If the phenotype of the arg1 mutant is 
recessive, the arg1/+ diploid cells will grow on minimal medium, without arginine 
supplementation.  At a molecular level, the haploid arg1 mutant had defective ARG1 protein 
and was thus missing an enzyme needed to synthesize arginine.  Arginine is an amino acid 
and without it the cell can not produce the proteins need for cellular functions.  The arg1/+ 
diploid has one good arg1 gene, can make sufficient amounts of normal ARG1 protein, and can 
thus synthesize the arginine needed to make cellular protein.

Complementation Test 

A single test called a complementation test can answer the next three questions. 
•  Which of the mutants have mutations in the same gene? 
•  Which of the mutants have mutations in different genes? 
•  How many different genes are mutated in this population of mutants? 
A complementation test is much the same as the test for recessivity, but a complementation 
test involves making a diploid using different combinations of the haploid mutants. 

If the diploid looks like the wild-type organism, the two mutations are said to complement. 
The underlying basis is the same as described above for our example.  The haploid arg1 
mutant has a mutation in the arg1 gene, makes defective ARG1 protein, and thus is missing an 
enzyme needed to synthesize arginine.  Likewise, the arg2 mutant has a mutation in the arg2 
gene and this mutation prevents the resulting ARG2 protein from functioning.  Without ARG2 
protein, the arg2 mutant, like the arg1 mutant can not grow on minimal medium. 

A diploid cell made from the arg1 mutant and the arg2 mutant would have one good copy of 
the arg1 gene (donated by the arg2 mutant), and one good copy of the arg2 gene (donated by 
the arg1 mutant).  This diploid would be able to produce functional ARG1 and ARG2 proteins, 
and because this diploid cell can make all the proteins required for arginine synthesis, it can 
grow on minimal medium. 

Remember that, without information, we randomly assigned names to these mutants.  What if 
by chance, both the arg1 mutant and the arg2 mutant had mutations in the same gene?  The 
resulting diploid cell would not have a functional ARG1 protein, and would not grow on 
minimal medium.  In this case, the arg1 mutant and the arg2 mutant fail to complement. 

Data from a complementation test might look like this where the intersection of a column and 
a row shows the phenotype of the resulting diploid.

These data suggest that the five mutants have identified two genes.  The arg1, arg2, and arg4 
mutants each have a mutation in the same gene.  The arg3 and arg5 mutants each have a 
mutation in the same gene, but a different gene than the one damaged in the arg1, arg2, and 
arg4 mutants. 

Epistasis Test 

Once you know how many different genes are represented by your mutants, you can perform 
an epistasis test.  An epistasis test can determine if these genes encode proteins that function in 
a particular pathway, and determine the order in which these proteins act. 

Given: 

enzyme 3

enzyme 1 
enzyme 2 
α------------> β ------------> γ ------------> final product 


6 

You could assume that an organism lacking only enzyme 1 would not form β and could not 
therefore make the final product.  However, if this organism had an exogenous supply of β, 
enzyme 2 could convert β into γ and enzyme 3 could convert γ into the final product. 
Alternatively, an organism lacking both enzyme 1 and enzyme 2 would not form β, and even if 
this organism had an exogenous supply of β it could not make γ.  Indeed, the organism lacking 
both enzyme 1 and enzyme 2 would need an exogenous supply of γ to complete the pathway 
and make the final product. 

Given the pathway above, you might also find that an organism lacking enzyme 1 would 
accumulate α, where an organism lacking enzyme 2 would accumulate β.  What would you 
predict for an organism lacking both enzyme 1 and enzyme 2?  You would expect α to 
accumulate. 

In effect, epistasis tests use just this sort of logic and a collection of mutants to define and order 
biochemical pathways.  Let's look at our example of arginine synthesis in a yeast model 
system.  Assume that the mutants unable to synthesize arginine were and categorized into 
four complementation groups.  We assume that each of these groups represents a different 
gene, and therefore at least four different enzymes are required for the arginine synthesis 
pathway. 

To continue, we need to begin to distinguish between the different mutants.  Often 
intermediates in a biosynthetic pathway are known and mutants can be differentiated by 
examining their growth on media supplemented with various intermediate compounds.  Each 
mutant will grow on a defined set of media that is different from the media that supports 
growth of a different mutant.  In our example, N-acetylornithine, ornithine,  citrulline, and 
arginosuccinate are intermediates in the arginine pathway. 

Our mutants were each tested for the ability to grow and on the various media shown below.

The growth characteristics of Mutant 1 predict that the arg1 gene encodes an enzyme, ARG1, 
necessary to convert N-acetylornithine into one of the other intermediates and this enzyme 
functions early in the pathway. The growth characteristics of Mutant 2 allow us to say that the 
arg2 gene encodes an enzyme necessary to convert ornithine into one of the other 
intermediates and this enzyme functions next in the pathway.  Working through the data in 
the chart allows us to propose the following pathway for arginine synthesis.

ARG4

ARG3 
ARG2 
 ARG1 
N-acetylornithine ---------> ornithine ---------> citrulline ---------> arginosuccinate ---------> arginine


We would further test this proposed pathway by creating haploid organisms that carry two 
deficiencies (double mutants) and determining the phenotype of these double mutants.  If we 
produced a haploid mutant lacking both the arg1 and the arg2 genes, we would predict that 
this double mutant would have the same growth pattern as seen above with Mutant 2. 

7


The double mutant should only grow on minimal media supplemented with citrulline, 
arginosuccinate, or arginine. These data would place the function the protein encoded by arg1 
before the function of the protein encoded by arg2. 

Alternatively, we could study the pathway by determining what intermediate accumulates in 
the mutant cells. Mutant 1, which lacks only arg1 would accumulate N-acetylornithine.  The 
double mutant lacking both the arg1 and the arg2 genes would also accumulate N-
acetylornithine. This data would also place the function the protein encoded by arg1 before the 
function of the protein encoded by arg2. 

Mutations in genes encoding essential proteins 

So far we have discussed mutants that could grow, given the right circumstances.  What, 
however, would happen if the gene that was mutated encoded DNA polymerase?  Without 
DNA polymerase, cells could not replicate their DNA, they could therefore not undergo 
mitosis and form new daughter cells.  This mutation interrupts an essential function, and 
regardless of the type of medium, these mutants could not grow.  How then can we use 
genetics to study an essential process? 

The mutations discussed so far have been mutations in a gene that resulted in a lack of the 
encoded protein or a non-functioning protein.  There is a different class of mutations where 
the change in the DNA still allows production of a functioning protein, but only under certain 
conditions.  Mutants with this type of mutation are called conditional mutants, and one kind of 
conditional mutant is a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant.  Temperature-sensitive mutants carry 
a mutation in a gene that produces a temperature-sensitive protein. At the permissive 
temperature (low temperature) when the mutant protein is translated, the mutation results in 
only a minor change in the protein so it folds into the appropriate three-dimensional shape, 
and is stable and functional.  The mutant appears normal at permissive temperature. 

At the non-permissive temperature (high temperature), the increased thermal energy reveals 
the change in the protein caused by the mutation.  The mutant protein unfolds, becomes 
unstable and no longer functions normally.  If the protein affected is essential, at non-
permissive temperatures the mutant fails to grow.  Thus, although the mutation is always 
present, the mutants appear wild-type at the permissive temperature and mutant at the non-
permissive temperature.  The existence of this type of mutant has allowed genetic analysis of 
essential cellular processes such as protein secretion and the regulation of cell division. 

Conclusion 

We have outlined a genetic approach in a yeast model system to studying many diverse 
cellular processes, even without prior knowledge of the genes or the proteins involved.  As 
researchers, we might study yeast cells for their applications in the brewing and baking 
industries, or we might study yeast because some species are important human and crop 
pathogens.  More likely, we study yeast to understanding cellular processes that are important 
in all cells, from yeast to man.  A good example of the relevance of a yeast genetic study is how 
identification key molecules in the control of cell division in yeast have lead to important 
discoveries in the field of human cancer biology.  So the next time you read an editorial 
demanding that taxpayer money is not spent on research of newt taste buds (just as an 
example), wait before you take up the cause.  Take a broader view of the possible benefits and 
ramifications that such a study may have.
