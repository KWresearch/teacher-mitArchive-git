Question 1 (29 points) 
 
Barney is an alien. On his ship, hidden in the Stata building, you find alien bacteria that 
metabolize wood. You call this species A. termiticus, and call your original strain BLT (for 
“Barney’s little termiticus”).  
 
You subject a sample of BLT to mutagens, and isolate a new strain that no longer metabolizes 
wood. You conclude that you have succeeded in disrupting at least one gene necessary to 
metabolize wood. You call the mutant strain M.  
 
You mix a sample of M with a sample of heat-killed wild type BLT, and the resulting strain 
metabolizes wood. You summarize your data in the following table: 
 
Metabolizes wood? 
Strains  
Yes 
BLT 
No 
Heat-killed BLT 
M 
No 
Heat-killed BLT +M  Yes 
 
a)  Did the content of any of the BLT or M cells change in the experiment?  If yes, which cells 
underwent the change, and what change occured? If not, explain why there was no change. 

 
 

 

 
 
You plan to characterize the alien genetic material. You start by breaking some A. termiticus 
cells open to determine their molecular composition. You find that they contain various small 
molecules, carbohydrates, lipids, and two other macromolecules, A and B.  
 
In order to determine which macromolecule is the carrier of genetic information, you repeat 
your previous experiment, but include test tubes where you treat the sample of the heat-killed 
BLT with either an agent that destroys macromolecule A (A-ase) or macromolecule B (B-ase). 
You find the following results (including the repeat of your previous experiment in the first 4 
lines): 
 
Strains and agents 
BLT 
Heat-killed BLT 
M 
Heat-killed BLT +M 
A-ase treated heat-killed BLT +M  
B-ase treated heat-killed BLT +M  
 
b)  Which molecule is the carrier of genetic information in A. termiticus? Justify your answer.  
 
 

Metabolizes wood? 
Yes 
No 
No

Yes 
No

Question 1, continued 
 
Next, you set out to determine the structure of the alien genetic material molecule. You first 
determine that it has six types of bases that you name S, V, W, X, Y, Z. You further determine 
that the alien cell’s content of S is the same as its content of each of X and Z; and that the 
content of V is the same as its content of each of W and Y.   
 
When you determine the structure of this molecule by X-ray crystallography, you are not 
surprised to find that the molecule consists of 3 interacting strands. 
 
c)  What base interaction combinations do you expect for this molecule?  
 
 
 
You want to investigate the mechanism of replication of the alien genetic material. You decide 
to repeat the Meselson-Stahl experiment. Recall that labeled strands are “heavy” (low in the 
gradient) and unlabeled strands are “light” (high in the gradient). Also recall that in the 
experiment, the culture is grown on heavy Nitrogen (15N), and is switched to light Nitrogen 
(14N) at time=0.  
 
Before proceeding you define three possible models of alien replication:  
•  conservative, in which, after replication, old strands stay together, and new molecules 
are made entirely of new strands; 
•  semi-conservative, in which, after replication, each molecule has one old strand; and 
•  asymmetric, in which replication creates a molecule with one new strand, and a 
molecule with two new strands. 

  

  

  

 
Each column in the table below reflects the predictions one of these models makes about the 
outcome of the experiment. The outcomes are described using symbols a-d to indicate the 
levels on the gradient as depicted in the figure on the right.   
 
d)  Label each column with the name of the appropriate model.  
 
# cycles of 
replication

You determine that each A. termiticus mother cell completes one round of genetic material 
replication, but gives rise to three daughter cells.

     shorter 

TA:____________________ 

 

Why?  

 
 
 
 
You isolate a mutant bacteria with the Playdo gene sequence below. The bold, boxed G/C base 
pair is the site of the only difference between wild-type and mutant Playdo—a substitution of 
a G/C base pair for a A/T base pair. As before, the bold C/G base pair indicates the start of 
transcription, and the underlined T/A base pair indicates the terminator.

h)  What is the effect of this substitution on the peptide? 
 
 
i)  Do you expect this peptide to have the same function as the wild-type bacterial peptide? 
Why or why not?  

 
 
 
 
 
Intrigued by Playdo, you search for a similar protein in mice by looking for similar DNA 
sequences in the mouse genome.  You find a gene that matches bacterial Playdo almost 
perfectly but contains a 36 DNA base pair insertion in the center of it. 
 
When you purify the Playdo polypetide from mouse cells you are shocked to learn that   
mouse Playdo is the same length in amino acids as bacterial Playdo. 
 
j)  Explain how is it possible that mouse Playdo and bacterial Playdo are the same 
polypeptide length even though they have substantially different gene lengths. 

 
 
 
k)  Do you expect bacterial and mouse Playdo to have the same promoter and terminator 
sequences? Why or why not?

The B operon contains the genes involved in the breakdown of sugar B in the bacteria E. fake.

The B operon is subject to both negative and positive regulation.

Question 4 (16 points) 
 
You hope to understand the lysine biosynthesis pathway, so you decide to look for mutants 
that can not survive without supplementation with the amino acid lysine.  
 
You mutagenize some bacteria, and plate them on rich media. You then replica plate from 
your original plate onto three plates: one containing complete media, one containing minimal 
media, and one containing minimal media plus lysine.   
 
By comparing the minimal and the +lysine plates, you identify six colonies that are lysine 
auxotrophs, that is, they require lysine from the media to grow.   
 
Below are the results of the complementation test, where + means growth and – means no 
growth.
