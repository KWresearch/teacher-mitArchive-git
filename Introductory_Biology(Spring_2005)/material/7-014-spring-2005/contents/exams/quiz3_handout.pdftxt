Question 1 
Shown below is the portion of the diagram from page 9 that shows the electron transport 
pathway. In this pathway, electrons are transferred from NADH to O2; the energy of this 
reaction is coupled to pumping of H+.

Under normal circumstances, cells carrying out respiration: 
• produce 36 ATP per glucose consumed 
• produce CO2 
• consume O2 

Two drugs, drug X and drug Y, can pick up electrons from particular intermediates in this 
pathway. This is shown above. 

a) You treat cells carrying out respiration with a saturating dose of drug X, so that all the 
electrons which would normally continue along the pathway are captured by drug X. Under 
these conditions: 

• Will the cells continue to consume O2? 

• Will the cells continue to produce CO2? 

 

 

• Will the rate of ATP synthesis increase or decrease or stay the same? 
Explain your reasoning. 

b) You treat cells carrying out respiration with a saturating dose of drug Y, so that all the 
electrons which would normally continue along the pathway are captured by drug Y. Under 
these conditions: 

• Will the cells continue to consume O2? 

• Will the cells continue to produce CO2? 

 

 

• Will the rate of ATP synthesis increase or decrease or stay the same? 
Explain your reasoning.

Question 2 

Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a bacterium that infects a wide range of broad-leaved plants.  Most 
of the Agrobacterium genes are found on its large chromosome, but some of the genes that 
allow this bacterium to infect plant cells are found on the bacterial Ti plasmid.  During 
infection, the bacterium transfers the Ti plasmid DNA to the plant and the plasmid DNA is 
integrated into the genome of the plant. This new DNA encodes plant hormones that stimulate 
cell division of the infected cells.  This excessive cell division produces a tumor.  

The Ti plasmid also carries the genes responsible for opine production.  Opines are modified 
amino acids that only plant cells infected with Agrobacteria produce.  These opines can be used 
by Agrobacteria as the SOLE carbon and energy source, and are not used by other organisms. 

a) Circle the correct answer… 

Agrobacterium is an autotroph  or a heterotroph. 

b) For the Ti plasmid DNA to have an effect within the plant cell, an appropriate promoter 
must be included for each gene. 

i) What is a promoter? 

ii) Describe the potential problem(s) of trying to express genes from a eukaryote in a 
prokaryote. 

iii) Would the genes carried on the Agrobacterium Ti plasmid have a prokaryotic or 
eukaryotic promoter?  Why? 

iv) What is the likely origin of the Ti plasmid DNA sequences? 

The major staple food for hundreds of millions of people is rice.  However, rice lacks 
carotenoids that are converted into beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A.  Millions of people 
suffer from vitamin A deficiencies. Rice has most of the biochemical pathway for producing 
beta-carotene, but is lacking two enzymes.  Using Agrobacterium tumefaciens and modified Ti 
plasmids, scientists have created rice plants that have the needed enzymes and can make beta-
carotene. These plants produce yellowish colored rice grains, called Golden Rice, which is high 
in beta-carotene. 

3


Question 2, continued 
To create Golden Rice plants, two different Ti plasmids were made.  In the first case, the Ti 
plasmid carried the crt1 gene from the bacterium E. uredovora.  The other Ti  plasmid carried 
the daffodil gene psy2.  You want to recreate the first of these modified Ti plasmids. 

c) You are given E. uredovora genomic DNA and want to use this to make a library in E. coli 
cells.  You purchase the following cloning vector for use in constructing your library. It 
EcoRI 
encodes the gene for ampicillin resistance (ampR). 
PvuII 

PvuII: 5'-CAG|CTG-3' 
3'-GTC|GAC-5' 

EcoRI cuts:  5'-G|AATTC-3' 

3'-CTTAA|G-5'


i) With what enzyme will you cut your cloning vector? 

ii) With what enzyme will you cut your genomic DNA?

3000 bp 

EcoRI

ampR 

d) You successfully cut both your genomic DNA and your cloning vector.  You mix them 
together and add DNA ligase. 

i) In what other cellular process have we encountered DNA ligase? 

ii) What does DNA ligase do? 

e) You transform E. coli cells with your ligated DNA to make a library. 

i) The E. coli cells that you use for transformation should have what phenotype prior to 
being transformed? 

ii) Once transformed, how do you isolate the E. coli cells that have a plasmid away from 
the E. coli cells that don’t have a plasmid? 

f) You successfully create a wild type genomic DNA library from E. uredovora. 

Assume that production of beta-carotene is essential for growth of E. uredovora cells on 

minimal media.  How could you use your library to clone the crt1 gene by complementation?

(increase, decrease, stay the same) of adding this worm to the tank, if the worm's waste and 
detritus was not consumed by the detritivores. Explain your reasoning briefly.

Solutions: 

Question 1 

a) won’t consume O2; will produce CO2; ATP will decrease because no H+ pumped 

b) won’t consume O2; will produce CO2; ATP will stay the same because H+ still pumped. 

Question 2 
Agrobacterium is an autotroph  or a heterotroph. 
a) 

b) 

i) 

ii) 

iii) 

iv) 

A region of double-stranded DNA where RNA polymerase binds and begins 
transcrption. 
1) The DNA sequence that defines a promoter is specific to that organism.  A 
eukaryotic promoter will not be recognized by prokaryotic RNA polymerase, so the 
eukaryotic gene is not transcribed. 
2) Eukaryotic genes often have introns.  An inton is a region of DNA that deso not 
encode protein and is spliced out of the transcript prior to translation. Prokaryotic 
organisms do not have introns and can not remove them from the transcript so the 
protein produced would not be correct. 
The genes on the Ti plasmid are expressed in plant cells so they must have 
eukaryotic promoters. 
The Ti DNA sequences encode plant hormones, so they likely came originally from a 
plant.

i) 
The E. coli cells prior to transformation must be sensitive to ampicillin. 
ii) 
The E. coli cells that are transformed can be grown on media containing ampicillin. 
Only cells that carry a plasmid will survive. 

f) You would have or create E. uredovora cells that are missing the crt1 gene (crt1- cells). 
These cells will not grow on minimal medium.  These crt1- cells can then be transformed with 
the plasmids from the library, and transformed cells would be grown on minimal media.  Only 
cells with the wild type crt1 gene will grow.

b) Decrease.  Now two organisms compete for fish waste (7), so the detritivores necessarily consume a 
smaller portion of (7) than without a competitor. 

c)  Decrease, but decrease not as large as in (e).  The two organisms still compete for fish detritus (7), 
now however the worm returns some part (necessarily less than 100%) of the portion of (7) it consumes 
as worm detritus.

Question 4 

a) Which of the above element(s) are limiting at each of the following times? 
i) At time (1)? Explain your reasoning. 
Phosphate.  We see that simply adding PO4
3– was limiting. 
This indicates that PO4

3– is sufficient to cause growth of most organisms. 

ii) At time (4)? Explain your reasoning. 
3– levels remain high, but nitrogen levels have 
Nitrogen.  We see from the graph that PO4
decreased, and the biomass of organisms is no longer increasing. 

–] in the water decreasing at time (2)? 
b) Why is the [NO3
As the biomass of organisms increases, so does the need for nitrogen, which is being used to form 
biomolecules, such as proteins, DNA, etc. 

c) Why are the cyanobacteria at an advantage at time (4)? 
Cyanobacteria can fix atmospheric N2 into organic N and thus are not limited by the decreasing

e) 

i) 	

1/2 of the flies would be brown, short-winged 
1/2 of the flies would be black, long-winged 

ii) frequency  =  #recombinants/total # of progeny 

The two recombinant classes are wild type and the double mutant black small-winged.  

Therefore, the recombination frequency is: 

(46 + 49)/(46 + 209 + 213 + 49) =  95/517  =  0.184 
Multiply this by 100 to obtain a percent value of 18.4% recombination frequency. 

Question 6 
a) Autosomal dominant, because affected individuals can be of either sex, occur in all 
generations, and always have an affected parent. If  d = normal allele and D = affected rare 
trait allele, than * = Dd 
b) Autosomal recessive; the disease is not present in every generation, intermarriage allows the 
trait to become evident. If  D = normal allele and d = affected rare trait allele, than * = Dd 

c) X chromosome-linked (sex-linked) recessive; carrier females pass allele to one-half of their 
sons, affected males pass allele to all their daughters, all sons of affected females are affected. 
If XD =  X chromosome with normal allele  and Xd =  X chromosome with disease allele, than 
* = XDXd
