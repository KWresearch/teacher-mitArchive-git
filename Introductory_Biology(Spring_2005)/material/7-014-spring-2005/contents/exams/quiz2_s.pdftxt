Question 1 (29 points) 

TA:____________________ 

Barney is an alien. On his ship, hidden in the Stata building, you find alien bacteria that 
metabolize wood. You call this species A. termiticus, and call your original strain BLT (for 
“Barney’s little termiticus”). 

You subject a sample of BLT to mutagens, and isolate a new strain that no longer metabolizes 
wood. You conclude that you have succeeded in disrupting at least one gene necessary to 
metabolize wood. You call the mutant strain M. 

You mix a sample of M with a sample of heat-killed wild type BLT, and the resulting strain 
metabolizes wood. You summarize your data in the following table: 

Metabolizes wood? 
Strains  
Yes 
BLT 
No 
Heat-killed BLT 
M 
No 
Heat-killed BLT +M  Yes 

a)	 Did the content of any of the BLT or M cells change in the experiment?  If yes, which cells 
underwent the change, and what change occured? If not, explain why there was no change. 
Some cells of type M underwent the change. They acquired some of the genetic material from the heat-
killed BLT cells. In particular, some part of the genetic material they acquired encoded for the gene that 
was mutated in M. Having received this gene, M cells now behave like the wild-type BLT cells because 
they can now produce the agent (like the Earth proteins) that restores the wood metabolism pathway.   

You plan to characterize the alien genetic material. You start by breaking some A. termiticus 
cells open to determine their molecular composition. You find that they contain various small 
molecules, carbohydrates, lipids, and two other macromolecules, A and B.  

In order to determine which macromolecule is the carrier of genetic information, you repeat 
your previous experiment, but include test tubes where you treat the sample of the heat-killed 
BLT with either an agent that destroys macromolecule A (A-ase) or macromolecule B (B-ase). 
You find the following results (including the repeat of your previous experiment in the first 4 
lines): 

Strains and agents 
BLT 
Heat-killed BLT 
M 
Heat-killed BLT +M 
A-ase treated heat-killed BLT +M  
B-ase treated heat-killed BLT +M  

Metabolizes wood? 
Yes 
No 
No 
Yes 
Yes 
No 

b)  Which molecule is the carrier of genetic information in A. termiticus? Justify your answer.  
B is the carrier of genetic information in the alien organism. This is because when the BLT cells are 
treated with B-ase, no B remains in the sample, and, as a result, no transformation occurs. On the other 
hand, treatment with A-ase has no bearing on the transformation ability of the heat-killed BLT cells. We, 
therefore, must conclude that B is the carrier of genetic information.

Question 1, continued 
Next, you set out to determine the structure of the alien genetic material molecule. You first 
determine that it has six types of bases that you name S, V, W, X, Y, Z. You further determine 
that the alien cell’s content of S is the same as its content of each of X and Z; and that the 
content of V is the same as its content of each of W and Y.   

TA:____________________ 

When you determine the structure of this molecule by X-ray crystallography, you are not 
surprised to find that the molecule consists of 3 interacting strands. 

c)	 What base interaction combinations do you expect for this molecule?  
Based on the data, we expect S on one strand to interact with X on another strand and Z on the third 
strand. We would also expect V on one strand to interact with W on another strand and Y on the third 
strand. 
You want to investigate the mechanism of replication of the alien genetic material. You decide 
to repeat the Meselson-Stahl experiment. Recall that labeled strands are “heavy” (low in the 
gradient) and unlabeled strands are “light” (high in the gradient). Also recall that in the 
experiment, the culture is grown on heavy Nitrogen (15N), and is switched to light Nitrogen 
14N) at time=0. 
(

Before proceeding you define three possible models of alien replication:  
conservative, in which, after replication, old strands stay together, and new molecules 
•	
are made entirely of new strands; 
semi-conservative, in which, after replication, each molecule has one old strand; and 
asymmetric, in which replication creates a molecule with one new strand, and a  

molecule with two new strands. 


•	
•	

Each column in the table below reflects the predictions one of these models makes about the 
outcome of the experiment. The outcomes are described using symbols a-d to indicate the 
levels on the gradient as depicted in the figure on the right.   

d)  Label each column with the name of the appropriate model.

You determine that each A. termiticus mother cell completes one round of genetic material 
replication, but gives rise to three daughter cells.  

e)	 Which of the above models is not consistent with this data? Why?  
In order to create three daughter cells, replication must produce three molecules of genetic material per 
cycle. Asymmetric model predicts creation of only two molecules of genetic material in each replication 
cycle. Therefore, asymmetric model is not consistent with data.

The following sequence of DNA encodes a hypothetical polypeptide called Playdo in a 
hypothetical bacteria E. hypotheticus.  Transcription starts at and includes the C/G base pair in 
bold.  The underlined T/A base pair indicates the terminator. 

5’-TTCCCCTATGGATGGTCATCTACGATGCCCCCATCACTAAAGCTTG-3’ 

3’-AAGGGGATACCTACCAGTAGATGCTACGGGGGTAGTGATTTCGAAC-5’ 


c)	 What are the first 6 bases of the transcribed RNA?  Be sure to label the 5’ and 3’ ends. 

5’-CCCCUA-3’ 

d)  What are the first 3 amino acids of the subsequent polypeptide?  Be sure to label the N- and 
C- termini. 

N-Met-Asp-Gly-C 

e)  How many total amino acids are encoded in this polypeptide? 
The gene encodes 10 amino acids. The 11th in-frame codon is the stop codon UAA. 

You identify a strain of bacteria containing a mutant tRNA that is capable of adding a 
tryptophan residue when it recognizes the codon UAG in the mRNA.  

f)	 What is the sequence of the anticodon of the mutant tRNA?  Be sure to label the 5’ and 3’ 
ends. 
3’-AUC-5’ or 5’-CUA-3’

Question 2, continued 

TA:____________________ 

longer 
g)  The Playdo polypeptide would be   the same length  in the presence of the mutant tRNA. 
shorter

 
Why? 
The length of Playdo would be the same in the presense of the mutant tRNA because the Playdo gene 
sequence does not include the TAG, so the mutant tRNA would never be used in translating Playdo 

You isolate a mutant bacteria with the Playdo gene sequence below. The bold, boxed G/C base 
pair is the site of the only difference between wild-type and mutant Playdo—a substitution of 
a G/C base pair for a A/T base pair. As before, the bold C/G base pair indicates the start of 
transcription, and the underlined T/A base pair indicates the terminator. 

5’-TTCCCCTATGGGTGGTCATCTACGATGCCCCCATCACTAAAGCTTG-3’ 

3’-AAGGGGATACCCACCAGTAGATGCTACGGGGGTAGTGATTTCGAAC-5’ 


h)  What is the effect of this substitution on the peptide? 
The second amino acid in the peptide, Asp, is changed to Gly in this mutant variant. 

i)	 Do you expect this peptide to have the same function as the wild-type bacterial peptide? 
Why or why not? 
We would not expect the mutant Playdo to function like the wild-type peptide. This is because the 
mutant peptide now has Gly in place of Asp. Asp is a charged amino acid, while Gly is not charged. In 
addition, Asp is significantly larger than Gly, which has the smallest side chain of all the amino acids. 
This substitution is likely to affect tertiary structure of Playdo, and, therefore, to alter its function.  
Intrigued by Playdo, you search for a similar protein in mice by looking for similar DNA 
sequences in the mouse genome.  You find a gene that matches bacterial Playdo almost 
perfectly but contains a 36 DNA base pair insertion in the center of it. 

When you purify the Playdo polypetide from mouse cells you are shocked to learn that   
mouse Playdo is the same length in amino acids as bacterial Playdo. 

j)	 Explain how is it possible that mouse Playdo and bacterial Playdo are the same 
polypeptide length even though they have substantially different gene lengths. 
Mouse genes have introns—regions of DNA within the coding sequence of a gene that do not get 
translated. These regions are spliced out of the initial transcript when mRNA is prepared. The 36 extra 
base pairs in the mouse gene are such an intron.  
k)  Do you expect bacterial and mouse Playdo to have the same promoter and terminator 
sequences? Why or why not? 
The promoter and terminator sequences belong to a language written in DNA that is “read” by the 
transcription machinery. This language is not universal, but is species-specific. Therefore, we would not 
expect bacteria and mouse to have the same promoter and terminator sequences.

Question 4 (16 points) 
You hope to understand the lysine biosynthesis pathway, so you decide to look for mutants 
that can not survive without supplementation with the amino acid lysine.  
You mutagenize some bacteria, and plate them on rich media. You then replica plate from 
your original plate onto three plates: one containing complete media, one containing minimal 
media, and one containing minimal media plus lysine.   
By comparing the minimal and the +lysine plates, you identify six colonies that are lysine 
auxotrophs, that is, they require lysine from the media to grow.   
Below are the results of the complementation test, where + means growth and – means no 
growth.

c)  How many genes (at least) must there be in the lysine biosynthesis pathway?  
Because there are three complementation groups, there must be at least three genes in the lysine 
biosynthesis pathway.
