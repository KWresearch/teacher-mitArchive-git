ii)  fill in Energy source (column 4) in the table above. For this part, you are not limited 
to the list above.  

b)  For a number of the metabolisms above, the electron source is the same as the energy 
source.  Explain why they are not the same for photosynthesis.  
The energy source in photosynthesis is light. While other energy sources are also sources of electrons 
(e.g. sugar), the energy source of photosynthesis, light, does not contain electrons. Therefore, organisms 
using light as an energy source must use a different source of electrons.

 donor 
c)  Organisms carrying out respiration need a final electron   acceptor 
transport chain (ETC) functional. (Circle the correct term above.)  

to keep the electron 

Explain how this compound enables the ETC to remain functional.  
The final electron acceptor removes the electrons after they have traveled the length of the ETC. This 
then frees the last protein in the ETC to pull the next pair of electrons from the next to last protein in the 
chain. The newly freed protein can in turn pull the electrons from (only slightly) less electronegative 
protein. 
If no final acceptor existed, the ETC would get “backed up” by accumulating electrons to capacity on 
ever less electronegative proteins. This back up would propagate to eventually saturate all proteins in 
the chain. 
Having a final electron acceptor relieves this potential problem.

Question 1, continued 
d)  Using an argument based on redox and energetics, explain how aerobic respiration 
generates more ATP per molecule of glucose than anaerobic respiration. 
O2 is the electron acceptor used in aerobic respiration. All the possible electron acceptors used in 
anaerobic respiration are less electronegative than O2. That means that each of these acceptors would 
operate with a shorter electron transport chain than O2. A shorter chain would include fewer proton 
pumps, so a smaller number of protons will be pumped in such a chain per molecule of NADH (and, 
consequently, per molecule of glucose). ATP synthase makes a new molecule of ATP for each proton 
pumped by the ETC. Therefore, a chain with as  a final acceptor will produce more ATP per molecule of 
glucose than a chain with any acceptor used in anaerobic respiration. 

Question 2 (22 points) 
Baby Jill is stuck on an uninhabited island. The food web quickly comes to look like this: 

Plants 

Mice 

Ferrets 

Baby Jill 

Detritus 

In this web, 
NPP (plants)=200 kg/day 
Mice AE (assimilation efficiency) = 20% 
Ferret EE (exploitation efficiency) = 50% 
Baby Jill EE = 40% 

IM (Mice ingestion) = 20kg/day 
Mice PE (production efficiency) =10% 
Ferret AE = 80% 
Ferret PE = 10% 
Baby Jill PE =10% 
Baby Jill AE = 80%

TA:____________________ 

Name:________________________________________ 
Question 2, continued 
a)  Suppose that shortly after baby Jill’s arrival the flow into the refractory carbon pool in the 
system decreased. Why was there a decrease? 
Jill starts consuming ferrets, which prevents these ferrets from ending up in detritus. Jill herself spends 
much of the energy she gets from the ferrets in respiration, so that energy is lost to the system. Since the 
detritivores now have less biomass to start with, less ends up in refractory carbon.  
Note that this analysis works only in the short term. Longer term, mice not eaten by ferrets eaten by Jill 
may provide enough biomass to the detritus trophic level to increase the flow to refractory carbon. 
b)  How many grams/day of carbon are stored in the form of ferrets? Show your work. 
IM x AEM x PEM x EEF x AEF x PEF=20,000g/day x .2 x.1 x .5 x .8 x .1 =16 g/day 

c)  Given only the information on the previous page, is it possible to calculate the mean 
residence time of carbon in the ferret trophic level? Why or why not?  
Mean Residence Time (MRT) is defined as pool/flux. While it is possible to calculate flux (as we did 
above), we do not know how big the ferret biomass pool is. Therefore, we can not calculate MRT given 
only the information on the previous page. 
Suppose baby Jill gave ferrets a drug that lets them increase biomass faster on the same 
amount of food. 

d)  What system parameter(s) could have changed as a result? (circle all that apply) 

NPP 

PEJ

 AEJ

 GPP 

EEF

 PEF

 AEF 

Why? 
Ferrets are consuming the same amount of food as before, so their Exploitation efficiency, or any other 
parameter that precedes it in the web would not be affected. The two possibilities are that the drug 
enables the ferrets to assimilate the food they consume more efficiently (AEF) or that it enables the ferrets 
to utilize the energy derived from food more efficiently (PEF). 
Baby Jill finds some squash seeds and plants them on a previously vegetation-free lot. She is 
tired of eating ferrets, so she plans to eat squash exclusively when it is ready.  Note that Jill is 
the only one on the island who will get to eat squash.  

e)	

In the table below, for each system parameter listed, circle Yes or No to indicate whether 
that parameter will change once Jill plants and begins eating squash.  For ONLY the 
parameters you believe will change, explain why in the space provided. 

Parameter  Change? 
Justify 
Yes  No  There is a new primary producer in the system, so the NPP increases.  
NPP 
Jill can consume entire squash, as opposed to portions of ferrets.  
Yes  No 
EEJ 
PEJ 
Yes  No 
Yes  No  Ferrets are closer in composition to Jill than squash is, so AE should decrease.  
AEJ 
Yes  No  There is a new primary producer in the system, so the GPP increases.

Question 3 (30 points) 

TA:____________________ 

You hope to use your hard-won 7.014 knowledge to make some extra cash over the summer, 
so you adopt two Chinchillas to start a Chinchilla breeding business.   

Your Chinchillas are Standard male and a rare Velvet female. Chinchillas with Velvet coats 
have especially thick, soft hair.  

Your first hypothesis is that the Velvet (coat thickness) is an autosomal trait.  

a)  Draw and label a diagram of a Chinchilla cell right before the first meiotic division. 
Pretend for the moment that chinchillas only have two pairs of chromosomes both of which 
are autosomal.  Your cell should be heterozygous at the Velvet locus. Make sure to label 
each allele, using A to indicate the dominant allele and a to indicate the recessive allele. 

A 

a 

a 

You reason that the rare Velvet coat phenotype of your female is recessive to the Standard coat 
phenotype of your male. Your male comes from a long line of show quality Standards, so you 
feel safe assuming that he is homozygous at the Velvet locus. 

b)  You cross you Standard male and Velvet female. If your assumptions are correct, what coat 
phenotypes would you expect to see in the 
i.  F1 generation? 
All Standard 

ii.  F2 generation? 
3 Standard to 1 Velvet 

In your F1 offspring you find chinchillas of both sexes with Standard coats and a lot of males 
with Velvet coats.  Your buddy  from 7.014 suggests that, in contrast to your previous 
hypothesis, the Velvet phenotype is recessive and sex-linked.  Chinchilla sex chromosomes are 
named X and Y and behave like human sex chromosomes. 

          5

Question 3, continued 
c)  Suppose that your buddy is right and the Velvet gene is on the X chromosome. For the 
parental cross below, fill in the parental genotypes of your Velvet female and Standard 
male. Use XA and Xa notation.  
In the F1, fill in genotypes and phenotypes of the expected offspring. 
♀____Xa Xa __________ 	 X  ______XA Y___________ ♂

↓


F1: 

♀ Xa XA 
all Standard 
♂ XaY 
all Velvet 
Among the F1 progeny, you find a lone Velvet female.  

d)  Is the recessive sex-linked inheritance pattern still possible given this data?  Why or why 
not? 
As shown in the predictions above, all females in F1 should be heterozygous for the Velvet allele, and, 
therefore, should display Standard phenotype. Presence of Velvet female disproves the sex-linked 
recessive hypothesis.  

You confirm with the use of internet that only one autosomal gene is involved in the Velvet 
coat phenotype. Your friend now suggests two more hypotheses consistent with this fact: 
(1)  your Standard is actually heterozygous at the velvet locus (Aa), while your Velvet is 
homozygous (aa). 
(2)  your Velvet is actually heterozygous (Aa), and your Standard is homozygous (AA). 

Recall that the parental cross (Standard X Velvet) gave a mix of Standard and Velvet coats.  
To determine which hypothesis above is correct, you do the following two crosses and get the 
following results: 

Cross 1: 

F1 Standard   X  P Standard  
↓ 
Offspring:  All Standard 

Cross 2: 

F1 Velvet  X  P Velvet 
↓ 
Offspring:  Velvet and Standard 

e)  These results support hypothesis number _2___ 
Explain your choice. 
Hypothesis 1 would predict that cross 1 would produce some individuals with Velvet phenotype, and 
cross 2 would produce all Velvet offspring. The data do not support this hypothesis.   
Hypothesis 2 would predict all Standard progeny in cross 1 and a mix in cross 2, so hypothesis 2 agrees 
with the data.

Question 3, continued 
f)	 After repeating cross 2 a number of times, the overall ratio of progeny is 1 Standard to 2 
Velvet.  Explain this result. 
The ratio indicates that the homozygous aa genotype is lethal. We would expect 1AA:2Aa:1aa ratio of 
genotypes. That ratio can only correspond to the 1Standard : 2 Velvet ratio of phenotypes if the aa 
genotype is lethal and is not observed in the cross. 

Since Standard coat animals do not sell for as much as Velvet animals, you buy several females 
with Brown Velvet coats to mate with your Grey Velvet males.  Brown is dominant over Grey. 
However, you are not sure whether the Brown Velvet females you bought are pure breeding at 
the coat color locus. 

You know that two unlinked genes are involved with these phenotypes— one for coat color 
(B/b), and one for Velvet coat thickness (A/a). After a few years of mating the original pairs, 
you find they have produced the following offspring: 

10 Standard Grey 
28 Grey Velvet 
13 Standard Brown 
24 Brown Velvet 

g)  For the parental cross above, fill in the parental genotypes at the coat color and coat 
thickness loci of your Brown Velvet females and your Grey Velvet males. 

♀_____BbAa__________  X  ________bbAa_______ ♂ 

h)  Give the phenotype for each of the possible F1 genotypes below: 
Standard Brown 
BbAA 
Standard Grey 
bbAA 
Brown Velvet 
BbAa 
Grey Velvet 
bbAa 
dead (never born—embryonic lethal) 
Bbaa 
dead (never born—embryonic lethal)

Question 4, continued 
You obtain the following gel after amplification. 

TA:____________________ 

e)  What is the sequence represented on the gel? Be sure to indicate the 5’ and 3’ ends. 

5’ ATGGTCGCCATAGCGA 3’ 

f)	 After sequencing the TOU gene obtained from your genomic library you find a 32 base pair 
insert in the middle of it that does not correspond to the mRNA for TOU.  What is it? 
The insert in an intron—the sequence that will be edited out of the final mRNA product before 
translation. 

g)  You want to express the TOU gene in E. coli. 
i. 	 Given the result in part f, would you want to use genomic or cDNA library for this 
experiment? Why? 
We would want to use cDNA library because the fragments in that library would correspond to 
final mRNA product, i.e. there will be no introns. If introns are present, bacteria could not edit 
them out of the mRNA, and so it would not be able to produce functional protein. 

ii.	 What organism must the promoter be from? Why? 
The promoter would have to come from E. coli. Promoters are not universal, and E. coli 
transcription machinery would only recognize E. coli promoters.
