Question 2, continued 
 
The glycolysis pathway produces energy from glucose.  
 
d) In what molecule is this energy stored?  
 
e) Where in that molecule is the energy that is used to perform work stored? Be specific.   
 
 
 
Breakdown of the molecule (in d) is often coupled with other reactions in the cell, making the 
new, coupled, reaction proceed at an appreciable rate.  
 
f) Describe one mechanism that is commonly used in such coupled reactions.  
 

 
 
 
S. oxyphiliae is an organism that can undergo fermentation or respiration.

of food. You place aliquot A into an airtight bottle and aliquot B into an open shallow 
container.   
i)  Are the cells in cultures A and B deriving all of their energy in the same way? 
Explain. 
 
 
 
ii) Will one culture run out of food faster? If yes, state which culture, and explain why. 
If no, explain why not.  
 
 
 
iii) At the time when both cultures run out of food, will there be approximately the 
same number of cells in each? Why or why not?  
 
    

 
 
h)  In the Krebs cycle itself, only one ATP molecule is generated per molecule of pyruvate. Yet 
we know that respiration overall yields more additional ATP molecules. Beginning with 
the products of the Krebs cycle, briefly outline how that additional ATP is generated.

You decide to study where in the cell glycolytic enzymes are found. You are surprised to find 
that these enzymes are not only found in the cytoplasm, but also in chloroplasts.

Question 4 (14 points) 
 
A popular line of research in developing environmentally cleaner and cheaper energy sources 
focuses on biomass fuel, or using ethanol produced from organic sources as fuel.  In order for 
this approach to be economical, sources such as corn stover, wheat straw, wood chips and 
waste paper would need to be converted to ethanol.  All these potential sources are rich in 
cellulose, molecule depicted in the figure below.

Question 4, continued 
In the 1990’s a group of researchers, called bioprospectors, set out to find bacteria that could 
help in the production of biomass fuel. For biomass fuel production, cellulases would have to 
remain functional in the harsh conditions used by industry (high temperature and acidity). 
 
To isolate thermo- and pH-stable cellulases, bacteria from several sources were examined.  
 
b)  Among the possible sources of bacteria listed below, choose the one you believe to be the 
most likely to produce cellulases stable at high temperature and low pH. For your choice, 
list the strong and weak points.    
•  Cow rumen (stomach) 
•  Human stomach 
•  Tree bark 
•  Acidic springs near active volcanoes 

 
 
 
 
 
The bioprospectors eventually isolated the bacteria Acidothermus cellulolyticus in Yellowstone 
National Park.  These bacteria secrete cellulases that function optimally at 80°C and pH 5, 
conditions that denature most proteins. 
 
c)  What type of bond might help stabilize the protein tertiary structure under such 
conditions? 

 
 
Bacteria do not produce enough cellulases for industrial applications.  Scientists are now 
attempting to make high levels of the cellulases in plants for more efficient production.   
 
However, active cellulases can not be produced in plants without destroying the plant. 
Cellulases have multiple subunits, and when each subunit is manufactured in a separate plant, 
the plants are not destroyed.  
 
 
d)  Explain why manufacturing the entire enzyme in plants destroys the plants, whereas 
manufacturing separate subunits does not.
