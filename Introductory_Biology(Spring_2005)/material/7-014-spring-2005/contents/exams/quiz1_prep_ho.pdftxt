•  Below is last year’s Quiz I (solutions at the end). It should give 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
you an idea of the format and types of questions we tend to ask on the 
 
 
 
exams. There is some difference in covered material and emphasis on 
various parts of the material between last year’s and this year’s 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
versions of the course. We do not guarantee that this year’s quiz will 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cover the exact same subtopics. 
 
 
 

Question 1 (26 points) 
The protein complex, LETMEGOTHRUIN (LMGT for short), acts as a channel or pore through 
which charged proteins and ions can cross the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane. LMGT 
is composed of four polypeptides as shown in Figure A. Figure B shows a cross section of two 
of the polypeptides.

Question 2 (30 points) 
MIT has produced a time machine that can send a team of undergraduates back in time.  The 
mission commander is expecting you to provide insight into the biology occurring at various 
time points visited. 

a) Your first stop is 4 billion years ago where you collect the “primordial soup” containing the 
precursors of life.  You observe a polymer in this “soup” that can copy itself. The mission 
commander wants to know… 

i) What is this molecule? 

ii) She asks you to sketch a single building block of this molecule below.  

b) Your next stop is 3 billion years ago where you find organisms similar to cyanobacteria that 
produce glucose from CO2 using “photosynthesis release 1” (cyclic photophosphorylation). 
An eager colleague runs through the airlock to collect samples of this organism, but quickly 
turns blue and dies. 

i) Your commander does not understand why this man suffocated when photosynthetic 
organisms are present.  Explain why photosynthesis is occurring but no O2 is being 
produced. 

ii) Cyclic photophosphorylation converts CO2 into glucose.  Briefly describe how these 
organisms use ATP synthase to generate the ATP needed for this conversion. 

iii) Once the glucose is made, these anaerobic organisms break it down to obtain energy. 

•  What process do these organisms use to obtain energy from glucose?  

•  What products are generated in this process?  

•  What does the organism do with these products? 

          4 

Question 2, continued 

c) Your next stop is 1 billion years ago where you find organisms similar to today’s plants that 
produce glucose from CO2 and release O2.  These organisms also obtain energy from the 
glucose they synthesize. 

i) When glucose is used to produce energy, what is conserved in the process these 
aerobic organisms use as compared to that used by the organisms from part (b) 

ii) These aerobic organisms generate 18 times more energy from glucose as compared to 
the organisms from part (b).  Briefly describe how this additional energy is generated.

i) Would Alanine or Serine interact more strongly with region 1?   Why? 

ii) Would Lysine or Glutamic Acid interact more strongly with region 2?   Why? 

d) You design many proteins that bind tightly in this pocket.  One of them has isoleucine 
associated with region 3.  You substitute phenylalanine for isoleucine and find this prevents 
binding of this protein. Phenylalanine and isoleucine form the same kinds of interactions with

Question 1, continued 

d) Describe how the polypeptides of the LMGT protein can be surrounded by non-polar 
hydrocarbons but allow charged proteins and ions to transit the membrane.

membrane and charged or polar amino acids lining the pore of the channel. 

e) One of the small molecules permitted to pass through the LMGT channel is PUNY, a 
tripeptide.  PUNY is composed of asparagine-proline-alanine with asparagine at the  
amino terminus.

b) Your next stop is 3 billion years ago where you find organisms similar to cyanobacteria that 
produce glucose from CO2 using “photosynthesis release 1” (cyclic photophosphorylation). 
An eager colleague runs through the airlock to collect samples of this organism, but quickly 
turns blue and dies. 

i) Your commander does not understand why this man suffocated when photosynthetic 
organisms are present.  Explain why photosynthesis is occurring but no O2 is being 
produced. 
Cyclic photophosphorylation produces glucose from CO2 but uses the redox reaction H2S  ÆS 
as a source of electrons for the production of NADPH, Thus O2 is not released as a waste 
product. 

ii) Cyclic photophosphorylation converts CO2 into glucose.  Briefly describe how these 
organisms use ATP synthase to generate the ATP needed for this conversion. 
Light energy excites electrons in chorophyll.  These electrons are donated to a series of membrane 
proteins, each more electronegative than the last.  As the electrons are passed from protein to 
protein, H+ ions are pumped across the membrane to create an H+ gradient. H+ ions move 
through the ATP synthase protein, down the charge and concentration gradient this movement 
is coupled to the synthesis of ATP from ADP. 

iii) Once the glucose is made, these anaerobic organisms break it down to obtain energy. 

•  What process do these organisms use to obtain energy from glucose?  Glycolysis 
•  What products are generated in this process?  ATP, NADH and pyruvate 
•  What does the organism do with these products? 
ATP is used as energy to drive cellular processes, Pyruvate accepts electrons from NADH to 
form lactic acid (or ethanol and CO2) thereby regenerating the NAD+ required for glycolysis 
to continue. 

c) Your next stop is 1 billion years ago where you find organisms similar to today’s plants that 
produce glucose from CO2 and release O2.  These organisms also obtain energy from the 
glucose they synthesize. 

i) When glucose is used to produce energy, what is conserved in the process these 
aerobic organisms use as compared to that used by the organisms from part (b) 
All the steps of glycolysis 

ii) These aerobic organisms generate 18 times more energy from glucose as compared to 
the organisms from part (b).  Briefly describe how this additional energy is generated. 
Some of this additional energy comes directly from further oxidation of pyruvate into CO2.  The 
electrons from NADH are used to generate further energy. These electrons are donated to a series 
of membrane proteins, each more electronegative than the last.  As the electrons are passed from 
protein to protein, H+ ions are pumped across the membrane to create an H+ gradient. H+ ions 
move through the ATP synthase protein, down the charge and concentration gradient and drive 
the synthesis of ATP from ADP.

a) What amino acid is present in region 2? Aspartic acid 

b) The substrate for this protein has not been identified.  Given the diagram above… 

i) What is the strongest interaction possible between the amino acid in region 1 and the 
substrate? 
Hydrogen bonds. 

ii) What is the strongest interaction possible between the amino acid in region 2 and the 
substrate? 
Ionic bonds 

iii) What is the strongest interaction possible between the amino acids in region 3 and 
the substrate? 
van der Waals forces 

c) The drug company has asked you to design a protein that binds tightly in this pocket. 

i) Would Alanine or Serine interact more strongly with region 1?   Why? 
Serine, it is polar and can form hydrogen bonds with region 1.  Alanine would only interact with 
van der Waals forces 

ii) Would Lysine or Glutamic Acid interact more strongly with region 2?   Why? 

12 

Lysine, it is  (+) charged and can form ionic bonds with region 2. Glutamic acid is also  
(-) charged and would repel. 

d) You design many proteins that bind tightly in this pocket.  One of them has isoleucine 
associated with region 3.  You substitute phenylalanine for isoleucine and find this prevents 
binding of this protein. Phenylalanine and isoleucine form the same kinds of interactions with 
the binding pocket, so why can’t the phenylalanine version of the protein bind? 
Phenylalanine has a large side chain that prevents the substrate from fitting into the pocket. 
Steric hinderence.

c) Modify the above diagram to show how it would change if an enzyme that catalyzed the 
reaction is added. 

d) What effect, if any, would this have on the reaction? 
An enzyme does not change the ∆Go of the reaction, but by lowering the activation energy, it speeds up 
the reaction C + D ÆA + B.
