Suppose baby Jill gave ferrets a drug that lets them increase biomass faster on the same 
amount of food. 
 
d)  What system parameter(s) could have changed as a result? (circle all that apply) 
 
NPP 
 
Why? 
 
 
 
 
Baby Jill finds some squash seeds and plants them on a previously vegetation-free lot. She is 
tired of eating ferrets, so she plans to eat squash exclusively when it is ready.  Note that Jill is 
the only one on the island who will get to eat squash.  
 
e)  In the table below, for each system parameter listed, circle Yes or No to indicate whether 
that parameter will change once Jill plants and begins eating squash.  For ONLY the 
parameters you believe will change, explain why in the space provided.

Question 3 (30 points) 
 
You hope to use your hard-won 7.014 knowledge to make some extra cash over the summer, 
so you adopt two Chinchillas to start a Chinchilla breeding business.   
 
Your Chinchillas are Standard male and a rare Velvet female. Chinchillas with Velvet coats 
have especially thick, soft hair.  
 
Your first hypothesis is that the Velvet (coat thickness) is an autosomal trait.  
 
a)  Draw and label a diagram of a Chinchilla cell right before the first meiotic division.  
Pretend for the moment that chinchillas only have two pairs of chromosomes both of which 
are autosomal.  Your cell should be heterozygous at the Velvet locus. Make sure to label 
each allele, using A to indicate the dominant allele and a to indicate the recessive allele. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You reason that the rare Velvet coat phenotype of your female is recessive to the Standard coat 
phenotype of your male. Your male comes from a long line of show quality Standards, so you 
feel safe assuming that he is homozygous at the Velvet locus. 
 
b)  You cross you Standard male and Velvet female. If your assumptions are correct, what coat 
phenotypes would you expect to see in the  
i.  F1 generation? 
  
 
ii.  F2 generation? 
  
 
 
In your F1 offspring you find chinchillas of both sexes with Standard coats and a lot of males 
with Velvet coats.  Your buddy from 7.014 suggests that, in contrast to your previous 
hypothesis, the Velvet phenotype is recessive and sex-linked.  Chinchilla sex chromosomes are 
named X and Y and behave like human sex chromosomes.

Question 3, continued 
 
c)  Suppose that your buddy is right and the Velvet gene is on the X chromosome. For the 
parental cross below, fill in the parental genotypes of your Velvet female and Standard 
male. Use XA and Xa notation.  
In the F1, fill in genotypes and phenotypes of the expected offspring.    
♀___________________   X   ___________________ ♂  
              ↓ 
 
 

 
F1: 
 
 
 
 
Among the F1 progeny, you find a lone Velvet female.  
 
d)  Is the recessive sex-linked inheritance pattern still possible given this data?  Why or why 
not?  

 
 
 
 
You confirm with the use of internet that only one autosomal gene is involved in the Velvet 
coat phenotype. Your friend now suggests two more hypotheses consistent with this fact: 
(1)  your Standard is actually heterozygous at the velvet locus (Aa), while your Velvet is 
homozygous (aa).  
(2)  your Velvet is actually heterozygous (Aa), and your Standard is homozygous (AA). 

 
Recall that the parental cross (Standard X Velvet) gave a mix of Standard and Velvet coats.  
To determine which hypothesis above is correct, you do the following two crosses and get the 
following results: 
 
Cross 1:  
 
       

F1 Velvet  X  P Velvet 
Cross 2:  
      
 
     ↓ 
     
Offspring:  Velvet and Standard 
 

F1 Standard    X  P Standard   
 
 
 ↓ 
 
      
Offspring:  All Standard 
 

 
 
 

 
e)  These results support hypothesis number ____ 
 Explain your choice.

Question 3, continued 
 
f)  After repeating cross 2 a number of times, the overall ratio of progeny is 1 Standard to 2 
Velvet.  Explain this result. 

TA:____________________ 

 
 
 
 
 
 
Since Standard coat animals do not sell for as much as Velvet animals, you buy several females 
with Brown Velvet coats to mate with your Grey Velvet males.  Brown is dominant over Grey. 
However, you are not sure whether the Brown Velvet females you bought are pure breeding at 
the coat color locus.  
 
You know that two unlinked genes are involved with these phenotypes— one for coat color 
(B/b), and one for Velvet coat thickness (A/a). After a few years of mating the original pairs, 
you find they have produced the following offspring: 
 
10 Standard Grey 
28 Grey Velvet 
13 Standard Brown 
24 Brown Velvet 
 
g)  For the parental cross above, fill in the parental genotypes at the coat color and coat 
thickness loci of your Brown Velvet females and your Grey Velvet males.    

 

♀___________________   X   ___________________ ♂  
 
 
h)  Give the phenotype for each of the possible F1 genotypes below: 
 
BbAA 
bbAA 
BbAa 
bbAa 
Bbaa 
bbaa

Question 4 (28 points) 
 
You are studying a small experimental plant known as Cactusus experimentalis. 
 
You would like to create a genomic library of Cactusus experimentalis so you can find the gene 
responsible for touch sensitivity, called TOU. 
 
a) List the three features your cloning vector must contain to be useful in construction of a 
genomic library. 
 
 
 
 
 
b)  After isolating the genomic DNA, what enzymes and reagents would you need to buy for 
the remaining steps of constructing a genomic library? (Circle ALL that apply.)

You create the genomic library (starting with an EcoRI digesting of the DNA), and identify one 
vector that contains your TOU gene.  You decide to analyze this vector further.  You cut the 
vector with EcoRI and purify the genomic insert. You then digest the insert with 2 different 
restriction enzymes SpaII and HindIII.  You obtain the following results: 

dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP 
ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, ddTTP 
Primers 
E. Coli 
Human Cells 
Cloning Vector 
DNA template 
ATP, CTP, GTP, TTP
