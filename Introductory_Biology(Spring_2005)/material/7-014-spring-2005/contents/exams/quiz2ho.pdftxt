Question 2 
Below is the partial sequence of the sevenohwunforin (7014in) gene, hypothesized to be mutant
in students who take 7.013 Introductory Biology and in those students at the other school up
the river.  The  promoter is underlined and transcription begins at and includes the bold G/C 
base pair.

and 3’ ends.

b) On the DNA sequence above, circle the DNA bases that encode the first amino acid of the 
protein. 

c) What are the first four amino acids encoded by the 7014in transcript? Label the N- and C-
terminus 

____-

___ 

d) You want to create a system to translate a specific mRNA in a test tube.  To an appropriate
water and salt solution you add many copies of this mRNA and ATP (energy).  What other key 
components must you add? 

You succeed in translating the mRNA in your test tube.  You repeat the experiment with two
identical test tubes. You add limiting amounts of the antibiotic puromycin to test tube 2 only.
Puromycin is a molecule that has structural similarities to the 3’ end of a charged tRNA.  It can 
enter the ribosome and be incorporated into the growing protein.  When puromycin is
incorporated into the polypeptide, it stalls the ribosome and the polypeptide is released.  You 
do not know if puromycin recognizes a specific codon or not. 

e) What effect would puromycin have on transcription? 

f) What effect would puromycin have on translation?

Question 2, continued 
g) You examine the length of the polypeptide produced in both test tubes. 
i) In test tube 1 (no puromycin) you get a polypeptide that is 100 amino acids long.  At 
least how many bases was the mRNA that you added? 

ii) Which of the following would you find in test tube 2 (has limiting amounts of
puromycin) if puromycin does NOT recognize a specific codon. 

Only a single type of polypeptide 

Only 2 types of polypeptides that are each different lengths 

Only 3 types of polypeptides that are each different lengths 

Only 4 types of polypeptides that are each different lengths 

Polypeptides of all sizes, i.e., dipeptides, tripeptides, … a polypeptide that is 100
amino acids long 

iii) Which of the following would you find in test tube 2 (has limiting amounts of
puromycin) if puromycin recognizes a specific codon that occurs three times in the
mRNA. 

Only a single type of polypeptide 
Only 2 types of polypeptides that are each different lengths 
Only 3 types of polypeptides that are each different lengths 
Only 4 types of polypeptides that are each different lengths 
Polypeptides of all sizes, i.e., dipeptides, tripeptides, … a polypeptide that is 100
amino acids long

Question 2, continued 
The 7014in gene encodes a protein (7014IN) that binds the neurotransmitter serotonin, as
shown below.  The five amino acids 7014IN involved in binding serotonin are shown. 

To understand the difference between introductory biology students, you have determined the
DNA sequence for the 7014in gene in a group of 7.013 and 7.014 students.  Below is the 7014IN 
protein and the DNA sequence that encodes it.  The amino acids depicted in the picture above 
are underlined. 

From a 7.014 student: 
5’ ACC AAT GGA CCA GCA GGA AGC GGG GTA GCT GAG TAC 3’ 
DNA 
3’ TGG TTA CCT GGT CGT CCT TCG CCC CAT CGA CTC ATG 5’ 

Protein 
N- Thr Asn Gly Pro Ala Gly Ser Gly Val Ala Glu Tyr –C 
h) You find that 7.013 student 1 has the following DNA sequence for the 7014IN: 

5’ ACC AAT GGA CCA GCA GGA TAG CGG GGT AGC TGA GTAC 3’
 
3’ TGG TTA CCT GGT CGT CCT ATC GCC CCA TCG ACT CATG 5’
 
i) Indicate (circle/underline) the site of the mutation on the sequence directly above. 
ii) Does student 1 have an insertion, deletion, or substitution mutation? 
iii) Would you expect this DNA sequence to encode a protein that binds serotonin?
Why or why not?  A chart of the amino acids is found on page 10. 

i) You find that 7.013 student 2 has the following DNA sequence for the 7014IN: 
5’ ACC AAT GGA CCA GCA GGA AGC GGG GTA GCT GAT TAC 3’ 
 
3’ TGG TTA CCT GGT CGT CCT TCG CCC CAT CGA CTA ATG 5’ 
 
i) Indicate (circle/underline) the site of the mutation on the above sequence. 
ii) Does student 2 have an insertion, deletion, or substitution mutation? 
iii) Would you expect this DNA sequence to encode a protein that binds serotonin?
Why or why not? A chart of the amino acids is found on page 10.

Solutions: 
Question 1 
i) 
a)
template 1
ii) B and C 
iii)  The lagging strand is more affected by the lack of DNA ligase.  DNA replication on the lagging 
strand occurs in small stretches called Okasaki fragments.  For replication of the lagging strand to be
complete, a phosphodiester bond must be formed between the 3'OH on one Okasaki fragment and the 5' 
phosphate on the other.  DNA ligase makes this bond.
