Question 1 
Your ongoing interest in bioluminescent organisms has lead you to study the Hawaiian squid, 
Euprymna scolopes.  Most nocturnal creatures cast shadows under the bright Hawaiian 
moonlight, and are easy prey to predatory fish.  This type of squid can shine light downwards 
to match the moonlight and avoid casting a shadow thereby decreasing predation. 

To provide squid for your studies, you maintain a large, self-supporting squid tank.  The food 
web of the tank is shown below. 

small fish 

squid 

phytoplankton 

detritivores 

When your tank is at steady state, you can harvest 10 kg of squid carbon/week and all the 
other biomasses (phytoplankton, fish, squid, and detritivores) remain constant. 

Given the following values: 
• NPP of phytoplankton = 2.0 kilograms of organic carbon per gram of phytoplankton per day 
• plant production efficiency  = 60% 
• fish exploitation efficiency  = 50% 
• fish assimilation efficiency = 20% 
• fish net production efficiency  = 5% 
• squid exploitation efficiency  = 50% 
• squid assimilation efficiency  = 80% 
• squid net production efficiency  = 40% 

a) What NPP (in kilograms of carbon) is required to support a harvest of 10 kg of squid carbon 
per week at steady state?  Show your work. 

2 

Question 1, continued 
b) Month after month, your squid harvest is 10 kg/week and all the biomasses remain 
constant. One month, you find that you can only harvest 5 kg of squid carbon/week and 
maintain steady state. 

You suspect that something has contaminated your tank and reduced your yield.  You propose 
two models to account for the reduction in yield. To test these models, you measure the 
respiration rate of the detritivores in the tank. You find that detritivore respiration has 
increased by 5 kg of carbon per week. 

Model 1: Phytoplankton photosynthesis is inhibited so that they now only produce  1.0 
kilogram of organic carbon per gram of phytoplankton per day, but at this new steady state, all 
other efficiencies remain constant. 

i) Is this model consistent with your measurement? Explain. 

Model 2:  5 kg of fish per week are dying with all other efficiencies remaining constant. 

ii) Is this model consistent with your measurement?  Explain. 

c) In their native ocean environment, the squid feed on a wide variety of small fish and 
invertebrates.  You suspect that the squid is the keystone species in this ecosystem.  What 
experiment could you do to test this theory?  What result do you predict? 

Question 2 
a) You want to build a larger squid facility.  To make better use of your resources, you plan to 
construct a life table to determine the mortality rate, fecundity, and the net replacement value 
of your population.  You follow 1000 squid eggs and collect the data below.

i) If you were to make a cohort life table using this data, how many squid would you 
initially have in your cohort? 

ii) If the fecundity of squid at 8 months = 10, and the fecundity of squid at 10 months = 
16, during which 2 month time period are more offspring produced? 

3 

Question 2, continued 

b) Surprisingly, your tank-raised squid are not luminous.  In fact, the glow seen in free living 
squid is due to a species of bacteria, Vibrio fischeri that live in a specialized light organ within 
the squid.  When juvenile squid hatch, ambient water enters the light organ.  V. fischeri and the 
many other bacterial species in this ambient water also enter the light organ and colonize it. 
All the bacteria initially flourish in this nutrient rich environment, but after 10 hours, only V. 
fischeri remain in the light organ. 
i) The interaction between V. fischeri and the other bacterial species initially colonizing 
the light organ can best be described as  _____________________. 

ii) The interaction between the squid and V. fischeri can best be described 
as 
_____________________. 

iii) Is the light organ of the squid the fundamental niche of V. fischeri. 
Why? 

iv) Is the light organ of the squid the realized niche of V. fischeri. 
Why? 

c) The interaction between the squid and V. fischeri is dynamic.  V. fischeri are only luminescent 
when the density of cells is near carrying capacity, yet when nutrients become limiting, 
luminescence ceases.  To overcome this problem, the squid expel 90-95% of the V. fischeri from 
the light organ as each new day begins.  By the following evening, the bacteria that remained 
have repopulated the light organ and it is once again fully functional. 

Using this information, graph the V. fischeri population within the light organ of a squid over 
several days. Indicate carrying capacity on the above graph.

Question 5 
To investigate the yeast metabolic pathway for serine biosynthesis, you screen for serine 
auxotrophs (mutants which are unable to grow without serine supplied in their growth 
medium).  You isolate four such mutants, and test them for growth on medium supplemented 
with several intermediates (A, B and C) known to be part of the pathway.  The results are 
shown below ("+" represents growth, "-" represents no growth).

Question 7 
a) Indicate whether the following statements are true or false. And if false, correct the 
statement or provide a brief explanation for why the statement is false. 

i) Plasma B cells secrete antibody into the bloodstream. 

ii) T cells produce antibodies that neutralize antigen. 

iii) Each B cell can make many different kinds of antibodies. 

b) When a rabbit protein is injected into rabbits, no antibodies against this protein are 
generated.  If, however, the same rabbit protein is injected into guinea pigs, the guinea pigs 
generate antibodies against the rabbit protein.  Briefly (in one or two sentences) explain this 
observation. 

c) The genomes contained in almost all of the somatic cells in an adult human are identical.  
Name one (diploid) cell type that is an exception to this and name the primary mechanism by 
which this cell type arose. 

11 

Question 8 
You are studying a common genetic condition.  The mutant allele differs from the wild-type 
allele by a single base-pair (bp) substitution.  This substitution eliminates a NheI restriction site 
that is present in the wild-type allele.  (The mutant allele is not cut by NheI.)  A pedigree of a 
family exhibiting this condition is shown below:

You isolate DNA from four individuals in the pedigree.  Using PCR techniques, you amplify a 
1000 bp portion of their DNA which includes the site affected by the mutation.  You digest the 
PCR products with NheI and analyze the resulting DNA fragments on a gel:

c) If individuals 3 and 4 have a daughter, what is the probability that she will be affected?  
Justify your reasoning.

Question 8, continued 
d) You sequence the region around the NheI site in the wild-type PCR product.  You then 
sequence the corresponding region in the mutant PCR product and discover that not only did 
the mutation eliminate the NheI site in the mutant allele but it has created a new PvuII 
restriction site.  The recognition sites for the two enzymes are indicated below.

your reasoning. 

b) For each of the following mutants (m1 - m4), predict the level of FadA in the presence of 
oleic acid.  Circle either "Low" or "High".

Solutions: 

Question 1: 
a)  10kg / (.4)(.8)(.5)(.05)(.2)(.5) = 12,500 kg/week 
b) 	
i) This model would predict that 1/2 as much carbon would be fixed by the phytoplankton. Since 
all efficiencies remain the same, this would cause all flows to decrease to 50% of their non-
poisoned levels. This would therefore reduce the detritivore respiration by 50%. This is not 
consistent with the observed increase. 
ii) This model would predict that 5 kg carbon per week of fish are dying and therefore becoming 
detritus. Since all efficiencies are the same and the tank remains at steady state, this additional 
input to the detritus must be made up for by an equal increase in output from detritus. Since the 
only output from detritus is respiration (refractory carbon cannot increase at steady state), 
detritivore respiration must increase by 5 kg carbon per day. This is consistent with your 
measurement.

Question 1, continued 

c) You would need to exclude the squid from an area of the ocean.  If squid are the keystone species, you 
would expect to see a decrease in the species diversity of the small fish and invertebrates. 

Question 2: 

a) 	

i) 840 

ii)  More offspring are produce during the period 8-10 months, where 24(10) = 240 
(as compare to the period 10-12 months, 14(16) = 224) 

b) 	

i) The interaction between V. fischeri and the other bacterial species initially colonizing 
the light organ can best be described as  competition 

ii) The interaction between the squid and V. fischeri can best be described 
as  symbiotic or mutualism or mutualistic 
The squid are less visible to predators, and the bacteria are provided a safe, nutrient rich 
environment 

iii)  No,  The fundamental niche is anywhere that the V. fischeri can exist.  You know that V. 
fischeri can also live in the ambient water, and it is likely that they could exist in a wide variety 
of places. 

iv) No,  The realized niche is where you actually find the V. fischeri .  You know that V. fischeri 
can also live in the ambient water, so the light organ can not be the realized niche

Question 4 
a) The m1 and m4 mutations are in the same gene.  This is a complementation test.  The diploid strain 
has the same  growth phenotype as the haploid single mutants; the two mutations fail to complement 
(fail to produce the wild-type phenotype) in the double heterozygote.  The m1 and m4 mutations must 
both inactivate the same gene (which codes for an enzyme essential for serine biosynthesis) so that the 
diploid double mutant has two mutant alleles of the same gene.

c) 

i) This haploid mutant will grow on media supplemented with intermediate A. 
ii) Intermediate C will accumulate when this haploid mutant is grown on  minimal medium. 
Question 5 
i) van der Waals 
a) 	
ii) hydrogen 
iii) ionic 
iv) van der Waals 
strongest interaction with substrate 2 is van der Waals 
strongest interaction with substrate 3 is ionic 

b) 	

c) substrate 3 would  bind the most tightly.  In substrate 3, you have two ionic bonds and two van der 
Waals.  In substrates 1 and 2, you have one ionic bond, one hydrogen bond and two van der Waals. 
Question 6 
i) FALSE.  DNA replication is initiated at the origin of replication.  RNA  polymerases bind to 
a 	
promoter sequences to initiate transcription. 
ii) FALSE.  DNA polymerase requires primers to initiate DNA replication. 
iii) FALSE.  Okazaki fragments are made on the lagging strand of the replication  fork. 
iv) FALSE.  DNA synthesis occurs by addition of dNTPs to the 3' OH growing  strand. 
v) FALSE.  Transcription terminates at the termination stop sites in the DNA.    Translation 
stops at stop codons in the mRNA.

Question 7 
a 
i) True. 
ii) False.  B cells produce antibodies. 
iii) False.  Each B cell makes one distinct kind of antibody. 

b) The rabbit protein is recognized as foreign (non-self) by the guinea pig. 
Also, T cells (by rearrangement of 
c) B cells, by gene rearrangement of Ab genes (VDJ rearrangement).  
T cell receptor genes). 

Question 8 
a) An autosome, because individual 6, a male, has 2 alleles. 
b) The mutant phenotype is recessive, because individuals 5 and 6 each have one copy of the mutant 
allele, m, and are both phenotypically normal. 
c) 1/4.  Since individuals 3 and 4 already have an affected child, then they must both be heterozygotes. 
d) 5’...GCCAGCTG...3’ 
e) A mutation occurred which led to the production of a new mutant allele, m*.  This mutant allele has a 
recessive phenotype and its PCR product is cut by neither NheI nor PvuII.  Individual 9 has the 
genotype m/m*. 

Question 9 
a) The FadX protein is an activator, since FadA and FadB need to be synthesized in the presence of oleic 
acid. 
b) 
If the activator FadX cannot bind to the operator, transcription of fadA will be low. 
m1: 
m2: 
Without a functional FadX activator transcription of fadAwill be low. 
m3:  Without the promoter, RNA polymerase cannot transcribe the fadA gene,  leading to a low level 
of FadA. 
If FadX is always bound, it will lead to the constitutive expression of fadA, leading to a high 
level of FadA.
