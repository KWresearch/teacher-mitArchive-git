Concourse 9.00 - Introduction to Psychology 
The almost Homeric Final for 1998 
 
In 1607, Claudio Monteverdi wrote "Orfeo". It is usually considered  
to be the first opera in the modern sense of the word. Sometime after  
1640 but, one assumes, before his death in 1643, Monteverdi wrote  
"The Return of Ulysses to His Country", an opera narrating the final  
part of the story of Ulysses' efforts to get home from the Trojan  
war. The opera provides the story line for this final. As usual, you  
do not need to know opera, Homer, Greek history, etc. If a question  
seems confusing, just ask about it. Use the back of the paper if you  
need to. Just tell us where to find the answer. You should have  
plenty of time to complete this.  Good luck. 
 
1. (6 pts) The opera opens with a character called "Human Frailty"  
singing that he is too weak to resist the forces that assail him.  
Different personifications appear to sing about their power over man.  
In the opera the forces are Time, Love, and Fortune. Let's consider  
some other forces that might have power over us (Pick one letter per  
blank). 
 
If Monteverdi had been a behaviorist like Skinner, he might have added ______. 
If he was a Freudian, he might have included _____. 
If he was an evolutionary psychologist, he might have included ______. 
 
Put the appropriate letters in the appropriate spaces 
 
a. neurotransmitter depletion b. environmental forces c. repressed desires 
d. recovered memories  e. reproduction   
f. free will 
g. circadian rhythms 
 
2. (15) That was just a brief prologue. The opera begins with  
Penelope, the wife of Ulysses and Queen of Ithaca, singing "Sorrow  
and trouble never end for me, miserable queen." She is depressed.  
According to her first aria, she has been depressed for more than 20  
years. Her problem is that the Trojan War ended 20 years ago and  
Ulysses has not yet made it home. She is still waiting. Classically,  
Penelope is the model of a faithful wife. In our less heroic days,  
her friends might suggest that she needs some treatment to allow her  
to get on with her life. Suppose we decided that she was clinically  
depressed. Please describe two possible treatments for depression  
(describe...don't just name them.). Please explain which of these  
would be more appropriate in this case. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. (5) Penelope's other problem is that she has a lot of house  
guests. Various suitors want to marry her. They figure that Ulysses  
is long dead and that Ithaca needs a king. Antinous, one of the  
suitors, really loves Penelope. She does not love him. However, he is  
convinced that she does love him. Freud might consider this error of  
thought to be a defense mechanism, protecting Antinous against the  
unacceptable thought that his love is not returned. This defense  

d) hysteria 

mechanism would be called" 
 
a) projection 
b) reaction formation  c) rationalization 
e) ego submlimation 
f) subduction 
g) Homeric 
 
4. (10) In the next scene, we meet Melantho, Penelope's maid, and  
Eurymachus, a servant of the suitors. They have a less complicated  
love life. He loves her. She loves him. They sing a lot about it. For  
our purposes, the interesting fact is that they found each other, two  
servants. He isn't trying to impress the Queen. She is not chasing  
after one of the high-born suitors. This seems to be an example of  
the old adage "birds of a feather flock together." In fact,  
individuals who are similar have better fortunes as romantic partners  
than do individuals who differ in wealth, beauty, intelligence, etc.  
Please explain this in terms of Social Exchange Theory. If you know  
nothing about Social Exchange Theory, say something about this topic  
that sound like you learned it in this course and pray for partial  
credit. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. (10) There is one dimension in which partners do not look for an  
exact match. On average, males seek mates who are slightly younger  
than they are and, conveniently enough, females seek mates who are  
slightly older on average. Please offer an explanation of this fact  
in terms of Evolutionary Psychology. Again, if you have no idea what  
Evolutionary Psychology might say about this topic, find something  
good to say from elsewhere in Psychology. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. (5) Ulysses is not dead (You probably guessed that.) In fact, he  
is asleep on the shore not too far away. He has just been dropped off  
by the Phaeacians...but that is another story. Anyway, he is asleep.  
Which of the following must be true if he is asleep, regardless of  
the type of sleep. Pick as many as apply. 
 
a) His muscles would be flaccid (low muscle tone, sleep paralysis). 
b) His eyes movements would be conjugate (eyes move together). 
c) His must be at or near the nadir of his circadian rhythm. 
d) He must show reduced hypothalamic activity. 

e) He must show elevated parietal lobe activity. 
f) He must not be a real macho hero because real guys don't sleep. 
g) None of the above. 
 
7. (10) Ulysses sees a young shepherd and asks him for some  
information because "he can have no dishonesty in his heart who has  
no hair upon his chin". Suppose that this shepherd boy sees Ulysses.  
He realizes that this is an old, shipwrecked guy asking for help. The  
decision about helping is a moral decision. Babies do not enter the  
world with a fully formed morality. Moral reasoning develops. Please  
describe some of the factors that influence moral development. Please  
define and use the empathy, internalized, and the principle of  
minimal sufficiency (550-551). If you don't know some or all of these  
terms, say something about moral development and hope for the best. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8. (5) Ulysses asks the boy where he is. The boy says that this is  
Ithaca. Ulysses is thrilled to find out that he is home, at last. He  
is even more amazed when the "boy" turns out to be the Goddess Athena  
in disguise. She tells him that he will be disguised as an old man  
until he can see what has been happening at home. She tells him to  
stick his head in a nearby spring in order to effect this disguise.  
He does but, Athena was not paying full attention. She inadvertently  
inactivates his right parietal lobe. 
 
Which of the following are likely consequences (Pick as many as you like). 
 
a. He would show neglect for the right side of space. 
b. He would show neglect for the left side of space. 
c. Because of inactivation of motor cortex, he would show paralysis  
of the right side of his body. 
d.Because of inactivation of motor cortex, he would show paralysis of  
the left side of his body. 
e. Because of inactivation of somatosensory cortex, he would be  
insensitive on the right side of his body. 
f. Because of inactivation of somatosensory cortex, he would be  
insensitive on the left side. 
g. none of the above 
 
9. (5) Athena tries again. Oops. This time she has inactivated his hypothalamus 
 
Which of the following are likely consequences (Again, pick as many  
as you like). 
 
a) He would never sleep again (unless she fixes things). 
b) His hunger drive would be disrupted in some fashion. 
c) His heart would stop. 
d) He would be blind because the pathway from eye to visual cortex is  
disrupted. 
e) He would not be capable of association learning. 
f) His head would fall off. 

g) none of the above 
 
10. (10) Finally, she gets it right and successfully disguises  
Ulysses as an old man. Meantime, back at the place, Melantho,  
Penelope's maid, is trying to persuade Penelope to remarry. After  
all, Ulysses must be long dead. Penelope is not yet persuaded. Please  
suggest two ways that Melantho could try to change Penelope's opinion  
about remarriage. There are lots of possible answers BUT please be  
sure that we can see the psychological content of your answer. That  
is, your answers must be based on material from the class. (HINTS:  
You might think about "attitude change" - Ch. 11 or Behaviorism - Ch  
4 or Therapy - Ch 19. You are not limited to these options.) 
 
 
1. 
 
 
 
 
2. 
 
 
 
 
11. (10) Back out in the countryside, we meet Eumaeus, Ulysses' old  
servant. He is now taking care of the sheep. When we meet him, he is  
talking (well, singing) to them. He is discussing kingship with them.  
The sheep don't say much. Maybe he should have been conversing with  
the apes or the parrots or the bees or some other species that shows  
some evidence of linguistic ability. Do animals have morphemes?  
Regardless of your answer, please be sure to define morpheme and be  
sure to support your answer with some facts. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12. (10) Actually, Eumaeus has been having trouble with his sheep. He  
is trying to train them to cross the stream on a bridge instead of  
going through the water. He has his schedule of reinforcement all set  
up. Every time a sheep crosses the bridge, it gets rewarded with a  
piece of Sheep's Delight candy. Nevertheless, the sheep are tromping  
through the water as usual. The problem is that Eumaeus has forgotten  
something. Here are some possibilities. Pick one and explain why this  
is the problem. 
 
Did he forget about... 
a. partial reinforcement 
b. the difference between negative and positive reinforcement 
c. shaping 
d. preparedness 
OR 
e. the fact that you can't teach an old sheep new tricks. 
 
please explain 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
13. (5) Eumaeus decides that the problem is that he has stupid sheep.  
In order to test this theory, he gives all the sheep the SAT (That  
is, the Sheep Aptitude Test). When he analyzes his data, he makes a  
variety of discoveries. First, the black sheep score 30 points higher  
on average than the white sheep. He finds that this result is  
statistically significant. From this result he can safely conclude  
(PICK AS MANY AS YOU LIKE): 
 
a) because sheep color is genetically determined, it follows that  
sheep SAT score is genetically determined. 
b) because sheep color is genetically determined, it follows that  
sheep SAT score has a genetic component. 
c) because the difference is statistically significant, it follows  
that the black sheep with the lowest SAT score will score higher than  
the average of the white sheep. 
d) if some white sheep were painted black at birth, they would have  
higher SAT scores than the regular white sheep population. 
e) if you eat black sheep, you will get smarter. 
f) None of the above: 
 
Feel free to add a line of explanation if you feel the need. 
 
 
14. (5) Eumaeus also discovers that SAT score is correlated with  
weight. The correlation coefficient is 0.5. Again, statistical tests  
show this to be significant. From this result he can safely conclude  
(PICK AS MANY AS YOU LIKE): 
 
a) Heavier sheep have higher SAT scores on average. 
b) Sheep with higher IQ scores are heavier on average. 
c) Heavier sheep have lower SAT scores on average. 
d) Sheep with higher IQ scores are lighter on average. 
e) Heavier sheep are lighter on average. 
f) none of the above. 
 
15. (5) From this same result, it also follows that (PICK AS MANY AS YOU LIKE): 
 
a) if the correlation of weight and SAT is 0.5, then SAT will be 50%  
of weight on average. 
b) Extra body weight makes sheep smarter. (Remember this would not  
have to be true of REAL sheep.) 
c) Extra body weight makes sheep dumber. 
d) If you want smart sheep, fatten them up. 
e) If you wanted to buy smart sheep from Eumaeus, buy his heavier ones. 
f) none of the above 
 
16. (10) Eumaeus thinks that the SAT is a measure of sheep  
intelligence. After all, it correlates with performance in sheep  
school. It correlates with subjective ratings of intelligence by  

sheep teachers. Indeed the relationship of SAT to sheep intelligence  
is a lot like the relationship of IQ scores to human intelligence.  
However, as you know, one can question the assertion that IQ score is  
a measure of human intelligence. Please describe one reason to doubt  
the assertion that IQ score is a measure of human intelligence. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
17. (10) Ulysses arrives (in disguise) and Eumaeus agrees to take  
care of him. Ulysses announces that Ulysses will soon be returning to  
his palace. Meantime, Athena goes off to Sparta to collect  
Telemachus, Ulysses' son. Telemachus has been of looking for his  
father. He was only an infant when Ulysses left for the Trojan war so  
he has grown up in a single parent household. Do you think that this  
would have had any influence on Telemachus' sexual orientation? Why  
or why not? Be sure that your answer reflects material from this  
course, not merely the opinions you have hear in the media, etc. (PUT  
YOUR ANSWER ON NEXT PAGE) 
 
17 (ANSWER) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
18. (5) Athena brings Telemachus back to Ithaca. He meets Ulysses who  
is still disguised as an old man. Before they have a chance to sort  
out who is who, the earth opens up an swallows Ulysses. Telemachus is  
understandably distressed and sings about this for a while. At a  
younger age, Telemachus might have behaved as though Ulysses had gone  
out of existence when he went out of sight. At least, that is what  
Piaget thought. He called this a failure of "object permanence". He  
held this failure to be characteristic of which stage of development? 
 
a) concrete-motor b) pre-operational 
c) concrete operational 
d) pre-motor 
 
e) sensory-motor  f) middle age 
 
19. (10) Please describe one piece of experimental evidence that  
suggests that children in this stage understand more about object  
permanence than Piaget originally proposed. 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
20. (5) So, Ulysses has been swallowed up by the earth. Now all sorts  
of lights start flashing. First, sun is eclipsed. It is totally dark.  
Then, a light of exactly 480 nanometers (nm) shines on the plain  
white wall of Eumaeus' hut. That light looks blue. Next, the 480 nm  
light goes off and a 570 nm light shines on the all. It looks yellow.  
Finally, both lights shine on the white wall at the same time. To  
Telemachus, the wall is most likely to look what color (assume  
Telemachus has normal color vision). 
 
a) white (or gray) 
b) brown 
c) bluish-yellow  d) green 
e) insufficient information is given for an answer  (If you pick "e",  
explain briefly) 
 
21. (5) The light, reflected to Telemachus' eyes from that wall is  
composed of the following wavelength(s). 
 
c) a roughly uniform distribution from 400 to 700 nm 
a) 1050 nm  b) 90nm 
d) 525 nm   e) ˆ(4802 + 5702) = 745nm 
f) 480nm and 570 nm 
g) insufficient information is given for an answer  (If you pick "g",  
explain briefly) 
 
 
22. (10) Next, a mysterious pattern appears on the wall. It looks  
like the picture on the right. Telemachus thinks he sees a white  
rectangle lying on top of a bow and four shields. However, as the  
borders of white rectangle are illusory. There is no physical contour  
in the image between the white rectangle and the white background.  
There are no "real" circles on the page. There are two thick black  
lines - not a single curve of a "bow". What rules or principles of  
visual perception are illustrated by this 
figure? Please describe two different rules or principles. 
 
Rule 1: 
 
 
 
 
 
Rule 2: 
 
 
 
 
23. (5) Finally, everything settles down and Telemachus sees a much  
younger looking man emerge out of the earth. The man introduces  
himself as Ulysses, the father that Telemachus has been looking for  
all these years. Telemachus does not believe it. He thinks that he is  
delusional and worries that he has schizophrenia. The name  

"schizophrenia" comes from the Greek for "split mind". What split  
were the 19th century psychiatrists talking about? 
 
A split between 
a) mind and brain b) brain and body c) left and right  
cerebral hemispheres 
d) emotion and cognition 
f)  
e) nature and nurture    
affect and emotion 
g) two different personalities (also known as multiple personality disorder) 
h) Democrat and Republican 
 
24. (10) If he has schizophrenia, he thinks that he should get some  
treatment. His options are psychopharmacology (drugs),  
psychoanalysis (Freudian), cognitive therapy, and behavior therapy.  
Suppose he really was a schizophrenic. What mode or modes of  
treatment would you recommend and why? You can propose to use more  
than one but whatever your choice, please explain that choice. (PUT  
YOUR ANSWER ON THE NEXT PAGE) 
24. (ANSWER) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
25. (10) Ulysses assures Telemachus that he is not insane. Still,  
Telemachus does not recognize his father. This makes sense. Ulysses  
had left when Telemachus was very young. However, Ulysses thinks that  
Telemachus should remember. He says, "I was in the delivery room. I  
was the first thing you saw. According to the primacy effect, you  
should remember me. Ulysses is confused about the primacy effect.  
Please define the primacy effect and briefly explain why it is  
irrelevant here. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
26. (5) Meantime, back at the palace, three suitors are still trying  
to get Penelope to marry one of them. Penelope find this wooing to be  
unpleasant. She also finds that the suitors will go away if she says  
she has a headache. As a consequence, she has learned to say that she  
has a headache with great frequency. To rephrase the situation in  
learning theory terms, Penelope has learned to emit a specific  
behavior because that behavior has been associated with the removal  
of an aversive stimulus. That removal appears to be acting as  
reinforcer. Which of the following is true statements about  

association learning is true. (PICK AS MANY AS YOU LIKE). 
 
a) This would not work because because the absence or removal of a  
stimulus is not a reinforcer. 
b) The removal of the suitors is acting as a negative reinforcer in  
this situation. 
c) The suitors are acting as a punishment in this situation. 
d) The fake headache is acting as a conditioned stimulus in this situation. 
e) This can be seen as an example of blocking. 
f) This can be seen as an example of habituation. 
g) This can be seen as an example multiple suitor syndrome. 
 
27. (5) Eumaeus comes in to tell Penelope that her son, Telemachus,  
has returned and that Ulysses is said to be alive. Penelope says  
"such uncertain tidings only make my grief stronger". She really does  
sound depressed. Here, even when given a possible way out of her  
troubles, she just sits there. Her state is reminiscent of those dogs  
who received unavoidable shocks and then wouldn't move, even to  
escape from avoidable shocks. This is known as: 
 
c) transference  
a) dissociation   
b) transfiguration 
 
d) the law of effect 
e) learned helplessness f) electroconvulsive shock 
 
g)  
operatic angst 
 
28. (10) The suitors are not amused. They conclude that Telemachus  
will not be pleased to find that they have made themselves at home in  
the palace and that they are trying to marry mommy. They decide that  
they will kill Telemachus. A neurotoxin sounds like a good way to do  
the deed. As part of their planning process. They discuss the  
workings of a normal neuron. Please label the following statements as  
true or false. If they are false, correct them. (assume a standard,  
mylenated neuron, for example one of the neurons making up the optic  
nerve from eye to brain.) 
 
T or F  
a) All action potentials are created equal. That is, they  
have the same polarity and the same size. 
 
b) Dendrites collect signals from other neurons or from sensory 
T or F  
cells. 
 
T or F  
c) The synapse is the point of contact between that other  
neuron and the dendrites. 
 
T or F  
d) Communication across the synapse is not be direct  
electrical connection. Chemicals called neurotransmitters are  
released by one neuron and received by another. 
 
T or F  
e) Signal produced in the dendrites but the reception of  
neurotransmitter can be either excitatory or inhbitory. 
 
 
29. (20) An eagle flies over. The suitors think that this is a sign  
from heaven that murder is a bad idea. They decide, instead, to make  
one last effort to get Penelope to marry one of them. The decide that  
this calls for some gift-giving. After all, they sing, "He does not  
love who does not give presents". 

 
That is an interesting thought. How could we explain gift giving by a  
suitor who is trying to engender love in another? All sorts of  
theories from this course might have something to say about this.  
Please pick two theories and explain gift-giving behavior in a way  
that makes it clear that you know something about the theory. You  
want to say something like this: "According to Rodent theory, the  
gift is a symbolic representation of cheese. As cheese is used to  
feed physical hunger,  so the gift then fills psychological hunger,  
i.e., the need to be loved." (Please don't use Rodent Theory).  
(ANSWER ON NEXT PAGE) 
 
 
 
29. Theory 1: 
 
 
 
 
 
Theory 2: 
 
 
 
 
 
30. (6) The suitors begin another party. In addition to the three  
suitors, there is a glutton and drunkard named Irus. Irus gets drunk  
and start talking strangely. First, he says: 
 
A. "Irus me drink eat liquor food". 
 
and then he says 
 
B. "Irgus flimly tropped the snorgly trum." 
 
Fill in the blanks: 
 
Phrase A is lacking in _______ while B is lacking in _______. 
 
a. syntactic structure  b. semantic content 
c.phonemic contours 
d. orthographic regularity 
f. true perjury 
e. deep lexicality 
 
31. (10) Eumaeus brings Ulysses in to the hall in disguise as an old  
man from the Island of Crete. The suitors say that he should be  
thrown out of the hall because...well, because he is an old man from  
Crete. Penelope accuses them of being prejudiced against Cretans.  
They say, "No, we treat everyone equally. In fact, some of our best  
friends are Cretans." Please explain how both of these claims could  
be correct. How could the suitors honestly believe that they are  
treating everyone equally and, nevertheless, behave in a way that is  
biased against one group. This answer should show that you know  
something about the psychological roots of prejudice. 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
32. (10) The suitors decide that it would be funny to have this old  
man fight Irus (the big fat glutton). This appears to be patently  
unfair. Irus seems likely to really hurt the old man who appears to  
be quite frail. The hall is crowded with other people. Will someone  
speak up and say "This is not right."? Please describe one experiment  
(not a news story or anecdote) that suggests that people might not  
speak up, even if they think that the fight is wrong. (Don't explain  
the theory...that is the next question.) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
33. (10) Please describe THREE of the factors that will determine  
whether or not someone will act in a situation like that described  
above. A brief account of "Social Impact Theory" would be good.  
However, if that doesn't ring any bells, please tell us why you think  
these three factors are important. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
34. (5) Against the odds, the old man beats Irus and throws him to  
the ground. This causes a temporary malfunction in Irus' cochlea,  
basilar membrane, and semicicular canals. Given these problems, what  
symptoms would you expect him to show? 
 
a) He would be dizzy. 
b) He would have muscle weakness, bilaterally if these structures  
were damaged bilaterally. 
c) He would have trouble seeing. 
d) He would have trouble hearing. 
e) He would have trouble breathing. 
f) He would have trouble speaking. 
g) None of the above 
 

 
35. (5) Penelope announces that she will marry any suitor who can  
successfully string and shoot Ulysses' bow. None of the three can do  
it. The "old man" requests a chance. He strings the bow and shoots  
all the suitors dead. This is extremely stressful for Irus. As an  
apparent consequence of this stress, he disappears from the court and  
appears in a small town some distance away. He now calls himself  
"Theseus" and he opens as small fitness clinic. He has no memory for  
his past as a palace glutton. These symptoms sound like 
 
a) repression 
b) reaction formation  c) a dissociative fugue state 
d) a schizoid break 
e) Capgras syndrome 
f) Homeric dysentery 
 
 
36. (5) Eventually, Irus recovers from this problem. However, now he  
develops and eating disorder. Specifically, he develops Anorexia  
Nervosa and goes from being a 32 yr old fat troublemaker who is  
obsessed with food, its rituals and consumption to being a 32 yr old  
skinny trouble maker who is obsessed with food, its rituals and  
consumption. Irus is not a typical anorexia patient. Please describe  
a more typical patient. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
37. (10) Please propose a plan of treatment for Irus. Please explain  
any aspect of your treatment plan that is different from that you  
would propose for a more typical anorexia patient. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
38. (10) Well, the old guy gets turned back into Ulysses but it still  
takes another half hour of singing to convince Penelope that this is  
her long-lost husband. But, finally, the opera comes to a happy  
ending. You, however, may not yet be totally happy. You studied for  
this exam and now some of that studying seems to be in vain because  
we didn't ask about what you know about. Here is your big chance.  
Write a question and answer it. No connection to the story is  
required - just a connection to the course.  You can write one  
10-point question or two 5-point questions (You can even make the 5  
pointers multiple-choice.) Don't forget to write the answer too.
