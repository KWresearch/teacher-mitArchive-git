9.00 Introduction to Psychology 
The Golden Compass points to the Midterm 
23 October 2001 
190 total points 
 
Having  read all of  the Harry Potter books several  times, my household has moved on  to  the  trilogy, "His Dark 
Materials"  by Philip Pullman. The  first  volume  is  called "The Golden Compass"  and  I decided  to use  it  as  the 
basis for the midterm. PLEASE NOTE: I use the book for a fine story line but you don't need to know anything 
about  it  in  order  to  do  well  on  this  exam.  If  you  think  that  the  story  is  confusing  you,  please  ask  and  I  will 
explain  the meaning of any question. We are not  trying  to be  tricky. Write your answers on  the exam. Use  the 
back of pages if needed. Good luck. 
 
 In  the  first  pages,  we  meet  Lyra.  She  is  about  11.  She  lives  in  Oxford  University. 
SCORE 
BUT  this  is  Oxford  in  an  alternate  universe.  NOTE:  Even  though  this  is  an 
p1 ____ of 5 
alternate  universe  assume  that  the  rules  for  our  universe  apply  unless  you  are 
 
told  otherwise.  Same  brains.  Same  mental  process.  Etc.  We  know  something  is 
p2 ____ of 20 
unusual  because  Lyra  (and  everyone  else  in  this  world)  has  a  deamon.  This  is  a 
creature  in  the  form  of  an  animal  that  is  part  of  you  even  though  it  is  physically 
 
separate.  A  whole  individual  is  person  plus  his/her  deamon.  When  you  are  young, 
p3 ____ of 30 
your  deamon  can  change  form  from moment  to moment. Around  the  time  of  puberty 
 
it  "settles"  into  a  fixed  form.  At  the  start  of  the  book,  Lyra's  deamon,  Pantalimon 
p4 ____ of 25 
(Pan), is in the form of a moth because she and Pan are sneaking around in the private 
 
dining room of the Master of Jordan College. She does not belong there. She hears the 
p5 ____ of 25 
Master coming in and she hides in a closet. 
 
 
1)  (5 pts) It is dark in the closet. If we assume that the light level in there is about the 
p6 ____ of 20 
same as the light of the moon, which of the following statements would be true 
 
about these scotopic lighting conditions? 
p7 ____ of 20 
 
p8 ____ of 30 
 
p8 ____ of 15 
 
TOTAL  

 
a.  Only one type of cone photoreceptor would be functional. Hence, no color vision. 
b.  Even if she was colorblind, at first, colors would reappear in scotopic lighting, 
after a period of dark adaptation. 
c.  Under scotopic lighting conditions, she would be particularly insensitive to light 
in the short wavelength end of the spectrum (what would normally look blue). 
d.  She would be unable to perceive depth. 
e.  a, b, & c     f: a & b 
g:  all of the above  h: Actually, none of these is quite 
right. 
 
2)  (10) The Master and another man discuss the impending visit of Lord Asriel. 
Then, the master mixes some white powder into the wine that has been set aside 
especially for Lord Asriel. Lyra watches the men leave and says to Pan, "They are going to poison him! 
Oooh, I bet that is one of those powders that makes all of your action potentials the same size and the 
same polarity." Would that be fatal? Please explain. (NEXT PAGE)

3)  (10) "Maybe", says Pan, "Or maybe it is a poison that kills you by shutting down Broca's and Wernicke's 
areas in the brain." "Nah", says Lyra, "That wouldn't kill you." What problems might you expect if these 
areas were inactivated? (7 points for a good general answer, 10 if you make it clear that you know the 
difference between the areas). 

 
4)  (30) Well, what are you going to do?" asks Pan, "Lord Asriel is your uncle, after all." Before she can 
answer, Lord Asriel comes in. He is about to have a drink of wine when she cries out and he moves to 
the closet and drags her out. When he hears her story, he questions her closely. He is not sure if he 
should believe her. Some of the details seem wrong. She doesn't remember what the Master's daemon 
was doing, for example.  

Even if she thinks that she is being truthful, Asriel knows that there are many reasons why a memory might 
be inaccurate. Please describe three different examples of memory error or distortion. These should be 
VERY specific bits of evidence. They might be experimental examples. Don't just say "she might have 
forgotten"  and don't just tell a story about when you forgot something. In each case, tell us three things   
- Describe the problem, phenomenon, or experiment.  
- Explain what might cause this sort of error (For example, "failure to encode new short term memories".) 
- Tell us whether this could be relevant in the present example (For example, this is unlikely because 
Alzheimer's disease does not occur in 11 yr olds ..... Now you can't use Alzheimer's...sorry). ANSWER

5)  (20) In any event, Asriel decides to believe Lyra and 'accidentally' spills the wine. When the Master 
comes in, Asriel apologizes. He explains that an incident in the north has made him "stereoblind". This 
means that he cannot use binocular disparity as a depth cue. Without stereopsis, he misjudged the three 
dimensional layout of the world and knocked over the glass.  

OK, he is making this up but is it a good lie? Could a lack of stereopsis contribute to an accident of this 
sort? Your answer should make mention of three other depth cues. Be sure it is clear that you know 
what the cues are. Do not just list them. Of course, your answer should also tell us why a lack of 
stereopsis would or would not make a difference here. NOTE: If you have no idea, describe four depth 
cues and hope for the best. 

6)  (5) Other Oxford scholars come in and, instead of a murder, a pleasant after-dinner conversation begins. 
One professor slides into a comfortable chair and says "Ah, the simple pleasures. Good food, good 
drink, a warm fire....." and another replies, "Strange to think that you seek these things just to produce 
activity in the correct part of the brain". "Oh, and where do you think that might be?" asks the first 

OK, it is a little simplistic to think that activity in one brain locus or the other is the definition of 
"pleasure" but, if you had to give an answer (and you do), which of these would make the most sense? 

a) hypothalamus  b) thalamus 
c) gyral sulcus  
d) lateral ventricle e) cerebellum  f) hippocampus 
h) Actually, this is really stupid (explain, briefly) 

d) occipital cortex 
g) the blue locus

7)  (5) Another scholar speaks up: "You didn't come into the world with a hard-wired taste for fine wine and 
old leather chairs. You learned these things. Through repeated pairings of one with the other, you 
learned to associate these sophisticated stimuli with other, more basic stimuli." He is talking about 
learned associations between two stimuli. This would be called (Pick One....unless you want to pick 
two...but picking one if two are correct is better than picking two if only one is correct. 

b) partial reinforcement 
e) classical conditioning 

 

c) Pavlovian conditioning 
f) positive conditioning 

a) operant conditioning 
d) air conditioning 
 
 
8)  (10) Eventually, the gathering turns to the real purpose of Asriel's visit. He wishes to report on his 
journeys and experiments in the far north and to get the college to give him money for further 
investigations. He is investigating "Dust", the name that they have given to some strange particles that 
seem to come from the sky and settle on adult humans but not on children. The scholars are interested. 
After all, the Church (in this alternate universe) thinks that Dust may be the way that sin enters the 
world. The scholars are also thrifty. They don't want to spend money if they don't have to. To get the 
most money, Asriel plans to use framing: "A heuristic that affects the subjective desirability of an event 
by changing the standard of reference for judging the desirability of that event." (from the glossary of 
the Gleitman text) 

What does this mean? Explain the role of framing in decision making. Give an example. The example could 
be from the textbook or you can invent an example - maybe one that would work for Lord Asriel.  

9)  (10) In the discussion of funding a new expedition, many names of places in the north are mentioned. 
Trolesand, Nova Zemlya, Murmansk, Bolvanger, Svalbard, Tungusta, Yakutsk, 
Spitsbergen, Trondheim. Lyra has always been fascinated by the idea of the north, but the names 
are new and she wants to remember them all. She can't write them down so she will have to try to use a 
mnemonic technique. Please describe two techniques that she could use. Please tell us which one would 
work better in this case (and why).

10)  (10) When everyone has left, Lord Asriel hauls Lyra out of the closet. He wants to ask her what she 
noticed. She wants to impress Lord Asriel with all the terms she learned about the north. Suppose she 
heard the place names in this order.  

Trolesand, Nova Zemlya, Murmansk, Bolvanger, Svalbard, Tungusta, Yakutsk, Spitsbergen, 
Trondheim.  Which three names is she most likely to remember and why?  

11) (5) Finally, exhausted, Lyra goes to bed. The next morning, she is supposed to have a lesson with one of 
the younger scholars who has been told to give her some education. She is not a willing pupil. He has to 
come and wake her up after 10 hours of solid sleep. She wakes and asserts that she has had a night of 
dreamless sleep. Which of the following is true? 

a)  When she was awakened, it is most likely that she had been in a period of REM (rapid eye 
movement) sleep. 
b)  Her claim of dreamless sleep is incorrect. She did dream. 
c)  If her sleep was dreamless (or during the periods when her sleep was dreamless), her EEG (the 
massed electrical activity of her brain) would have been almost flat with just a little vegetative 
activity keep heart, lungs, etc. running. 
d)  Sleeping for 10 hours is against the law, but it would be worth it. 
e)  None of the above is likely to be true. 

12) (5) Maybe Lyra is a reluctant pupil because her teacher is trying to get her to understand color vision. He 
takes a 470 nm light (It looks blue) and a 570 nm light (It looks yellow) and shines them both on a white 
wall at the same spot. What is the wavelength composition of the light, reflected from the wall to Lyra's 
eye? 
a)  470+570=1040nm 
b)  nope, its the average (470 + 570) / 2 = 520 nm 
c)  nope, its Pythagorean: sqrt((470*470)+(570*570)) = 739 nm 
d)  nope, you have to divide that by 2 = 390 nm 
e)  no, no....these lights, bounced off a "white" wall, will produce a broadband of all the visible 
wavelengths. 
f)  nah, it will be just a mix of 470 and 570 nm. 
g)  nope, this is opponent process territory so (570-470) = 100 nm 
h)  Who knows? Not me! (1 pt for honesty)

13) (5) What would Lyra see in this case? What would the spot look like? 

a) white 
b) bluish-yellow 
c) green 
d) purple 
e) nothing, these wavelengths will cancel each other. 
f) Lyra will see the error of her ways and become a vision researcher. 

14) (15) When class is over, Lyra runs off to find her best friend, Roger, the kitchen boy. They run up to the 
roof of the college to check on their crows. Roger, Lyra and their friends have been feeding different 
crows. They have made different rules for different crows. 

Buckbeak gets fed every time the college bell rings. It rings every 15 minutes. So, every 15 minutes the bird 
gets a bit of food. 
 
Fluffy gets fed when the bell rings....sometimes....On average, Fluffy gets food on every 5 bell rings. 
 
Norbert gets fed on average every 15 minutes. However, half the time this is when the bell rings and half the 
time, Norbert gets fed when the bell has not rung.  
 
All the birds have learned to come to the roof for food. Here is the problem, all day yesterday, the door to 
the roof was locked so the birds got no food yesterday. The children managed to get the door open this 
morning. That means many bells with no food. When the first bell of the morning rings, which bird is most 
likely to show up and why? A GOOD answer will be full of evidence that you know something about 
Instrumental Conditioning (pp128-139). All answers must say something about ALL THREE BIRDS.

15) (20) Lyra and Roger are also trying to teach the crows to talk. After all, daemons can talk and they have 
animal form and, in fact, the Master of Jordan College has a daemon in the form of a raven. For 
purposes of this discussion, let us suppose that these crows can vocalize like the best parrot and that they 
are as smart as chimpanzees (or gray parrots, who ever you think is smarter). How much will the 
children be able to teach these birds?   

For full credit, your answer must show that you understand the following four terms: phoneme, morpheme, 
semantics, and syntax. Your answer must also take a position on the question of whether language is 
unique to humans (in our world). You can argue either side of the issue. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

16. (10) Lyra and Roger and the other children of the college routinely fight with the children from the 
town. In particular, the brick makers' children. The scholars in the college are opposed to this, of course. 
One scholar asks Lyra why she leads her friends into battle and she says that "All brick makers’ kids are 
bad". "Do you really believe that?" the scholar asks. "No, not really", Lyra replies, "I guess some of 
them are OK but I can't tell them apart." "Ah", says the scholar, "that is a problem in Signal Detection 
Theory. You are making errors in discriminating good bricklayers from bad ones. Or, to put it another 
way, when you encounter one of these children, you cannot tell if that child comes from the "good" 
distribution or the "bad" one. All you need to do is to shift your criterion toward the good, and you will 
stop labeling "good" children as "bad". What is the problem with this well-meaning advice? Assume that 
there really are "good" and "bad" children. Be sure your answer reveals some knowledge of signal 
detection theory

17. (5) The Scholar takes out a strange drawing 
(that looks a lot like the drawing on this 
page). He declares that this is a way of 
plotting the results of a person's choices. It 
could be choices about questions like "did I 
see that very dim light". It could be a choice 
between accepting someone as a friend or 
rejecting him as an enemy. As Lyra gets 
older, the scholar says that her wisdom will 
increase. He says that she, as an ignorant 
child, lives on the line marked "0" but as 
she gains wisdom, she will move to curve 
"1" and, with work to  "2" or even "3". We 
are still in the realm of signal detection 
theory. What do the labels on the curve 
refer to?

18. (10) Does the scholar's analogy make any sense? In what way would a shift from 0 to 1 to 2 to 3 
represent and increase in wisdom? Does he have it backwards? Is this just complete nonsense?  

Well, this is barely the beginning of the book. Roger gets kidnapped. Lyra goes to London, but that doesn't 
really work out. There are murders and bears that wear armor...but I am out of time. Ah well, hope you did 
well.
