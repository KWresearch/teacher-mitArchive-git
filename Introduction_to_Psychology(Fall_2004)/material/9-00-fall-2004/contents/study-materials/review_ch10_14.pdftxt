Q: what are some of the shortcomings of intelligence tests?   what is their predictive validity? 

multiple intelligences (creative, practical, IQ) 
savants 

psychometric approach

fluid vs. crystallized intelligence 

NATURE VS. NURTURE 
what is the debate? 
frame in terms of situational vs. dispositional 

Q: 

twin studies show ?

 

heritability ratio 
phenotype vs. genotype  (social effects of phenotype produce environmental effects 
(nurture) while genotype specifies nature) 
 
individual variability 

Q:  compare intelligence tests with personality tests.  shortcomings?  validity?  same kinds of 
factors? 

intelligence might be considered just that which is not situationally dependent, but an inherent 
characteristic of the self.
