 “Arthur, the good King of Britain, whose prowess teaches us that we, too, should be 
brave and courteous, held a rich and royal court …….” That is the beginning of a 
12th century Romance by Chretien de Troyes entitled “Yvain or The Knight with the 
Lion”  I am using Yvain as the cover story. PLEASE NOTE: As on the midterm, the 
story is just the story, not the content of this exam. If you think that the story is 
confusing you, please ask and we will explain the meaning of any question. We are 
not trying to be tricky. Write your answers on the exam. Use the back of pages if 
needed. Good luck. 
 
1. (15 pts) The story has an odd start. The knights and ladies at the feast are a bit 
offended when King Arthur goes off to take a nap. Several knights are gathered 
outside the king’s chamber and they discuss matters. “Perhaps” says Sir Sagremor, 
“our tales of adventures are not sufficient and he has gone off to dream about more 
exciting quests”. “No” says Sir Dodinel, “He has only been asleep for an hour and a 
half. He would not have had a dream in that time.” 
 
a) Is it possible that Arthur would have had a dream in that time?  
(“yes” or “no”  will do) 
 
b) What would you estimate the probability of having had a dream to be? Briefly 
explain your answer? 
 
 
 
 
c) Assuming that he did not remember having a dream when he woke up, how could 
you have tested your hypothesis (Using the tools available to in a 21st century sleep 
lab and not a 12th century castle.) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. (5)  Sir Calogrenant (That name sounds like a diet aide) begins to tell a story. The 
queen hears him from the next room and comes to listen. No one sees her at first but when Calogrenant 
does see her, he leaps to his feet (because that is what you do when the queen arrives). Sir Kay (who is 
“very quarrelsome, mean, sarcastic, and abusive”) accuses Calogrenant of being a show-off and of being 
someone who just wants to make everyone else look bad. The queen says “Sir Kay, no harm is done. 
None of you saw me. You are committing the fundamental attribution error”.

Is the queen correct about the fundamental attribution error?  
a)  She could be correct because Kay is showing a tendency to attribute behaviors to dispositional 
qualities while underrating the role of the situation. 
b)  She could be correct because Kay is showing a tendency to think badly of an individual (other 
than oneself). 
c)  She is wrong because the fundamental attribution error refers to the tendency to overestimate the 
probability of highly salient events. 
d)  She is wrong because the fundamental attribution error involves assuming that humans (or other 
animals) are “blank slates”. 
e)  She is wrong because no fundamentals were attributed here at all. 
f)  She is wrong because monarchy is wrong. Long live the revolution! 

 
3. (10) Having calmed Kay, the queen commands Calogrenant to tell his story. He says that he was 
traveling through a dark wood filled with thorns and pits and the sounds of dangerous beasts. He was 
happy, therefore, to find a castle where he could stay for the night and happier still to find that it 
contained “a very fair and gentle maid”. He really likes her. This happens A Lot in this story. Every time 
a knight comes out of the dangerous wild woods and meets a girl, she is described as lovely and gentle 
and the best maid in the world and so forth. Now, it seems unlikely that all of young women in this part 
of the world were of above average beauty. Why do the knights keep falling in love with every well-
born girl that they see? 
 
There are LOTS of answers to this. Pick one and defend it with two pieces of concrete evidence from 
this course. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. (10) Calogrenant is looking for an adventure and so he is directed to a clearing in the woods where 
there is a basin of water and a perforated stone. If you toss the water on the stone Stuff Happens. So, he 
does this, of course, and there is a HUGE storm: “the heavens so break loose that from more than 
fourteen directions the lightning blinded my eyes, and all at once the clouds let fall snow and rain and 
hail”. He gets struck by lightning. Fortunately, for him, this does not kill him and fortunately for us, he 
receives exactly the dose of electricity that we might apply if we were giving him electro-convulsive 
shock (ECS) or electro-convulsive therapy (ECT). He is knocked to the ground. 
 
When he gets up, he sees the basin and the stone. Does he throw water on the stone again? Why or why 
not? (Be sure your answer uses SOMETHING from the course).

5. (5) Whatever else may happen to him, this ECT experience could be therapeutic if he suffered from

a)  dissociation   b) multiple-personality disorder  
d)   depression

g)   a & b 

c) dementia 
f) microcephaly 
i) none of the above 

 
 
6. (5) After the storm has passed, a large, well-armed knight appears and knocks him down with a big 
lance so that poor Calogrenant was seeing stars – not real stars, but the sort you might see if you were 
knocked hard on the head. Why does he see stars? 
 

a)  The blow mechanically stimulated the neurons of the retina and this activity is interpreted as 
“light” of some sort by the visual system. 
b)  The blow produces abnormal activity in the visual system. This causes “antidromal” (backward) 
activation of the photoreceptors from electrical activity in the brain and the retina. Thus, instead 
of light producing electrical activity, you get electrical activity producing light (photon release). 
This light is then seen in the usual manner.  
c)  The blow mechanically stimulated the central visual system (e.g. visual cortex) and activity in 
the visual system can be interpreted as “light” of some sort by the brain. 
d)  The blow could cause a release of glia into synapses in the visual system. This could activate 
neurons and that activity could be interpreted as light. 
e)  Shear forces in the lens and/or cornea can cause photon release that would be seen as “stars”. 
f)  A & C   
i) any of these might happen 
h) B & D 
g) C & D 
j)   This is all nonsense. Only cartoon characters “see stars” when hit on the head. 

 
 
7. (10) “Thus I went and thus I returned, feeling, as I did so, deeply ashamed.” says Calogrenant, at the 
end of his story. Yvain, who is Calogrenant’s kinsman, jumps up and declares that he will avenge this 
dishonor to Calogrenant. Sir Kay immediately begins calling Yvain a braggart and a coward and so 
forth. The queen says “Sir Kay, What is your problem. Get help.” Well, the queen is the queen so Sir 
Kay goes to see Sir Sigmund the Psychoanalytic. Sigmund (a good Freudian, of course) says that Kay’s 
behavior is an illustration of a classic Freudian defense mechanism.  
 
Please explain Kay’s rude behavior in terms of one Freudian defense mechanism. NOTE: Several will 
work. Be sure that you give the name of the defense mechanism that you are using, define it clearly, and 
explain how it might apply in this case.

8. (10) When Kay thinks about “defense”, he is thinking about moats and drawbridges. That is not what 
Sir Sigmund is talking about. He is talking about Freud’s idea of a defense mechanism. In Freud’s 
theory 
 
Who/what is being defended?  
 
Against what?  
 
Why?  
 
 
 
 
9. (5) Yvain rides off to avenge his kinsman and, in time, comes to the clearing with the stone and the 
basin. He does the storm thing. I failed to mention earlier that, after the storm, a whole flock of birds 
always comes to roost in a pine tree and “sing their joyous songs up above the perilous spring”. Yvain 
can hear the music because 
 

a)  vibrations transmitted to the auditory canal by the basilar membrane cause electrical signals in 
the ossicles. 
b)  Pressure changes in the hair cells release neurotransmitters that stimulate the stapes which, in 
turn, cause electrical signals to travel up the auditory nerve. 
c)  Vibration of the ossicles causes the chorda tympani to resonate at the frequency of the input. 
d)  Pressure changes in the fluid in the cochlea lead to vibrations of the basilar membrane and its 
deformations bend and, as a result, activate the hair cells. 
e)  He downloaded the file into his MP3 player. 

 
10. (5) After the bird chorus takes a bow, in comes the other knight, “more blazing with wrath than a 
burning log”. So they fight and, in the end, Yvain cuts the other knight’s corpus callosum. This is the big 
bundle of fibers that connects the two cerebral hemispheres. If this was done carefully (i.e. not with a 
broad sword) the mostly likely outcome would be 
 

a)  some form of dissociation / split personality 
b)  some form of schizophrenia (obviously, not one that could be easily treated with drugs)  
c)  contralateral neglect 
d)  anterograde amnesia  
e)  Tourette’s syndrome 
f)  Interestingly, if done carefully, there would be NO detectable consequence of this lesion. 
g)  None of the above 

 
11.(10)  Unfortunately, this was not done carefully and the knight was mortally wounded by Yvain’s 
blow. The knight rides as fast as he can back toward his castle with Yvain in pursuit. As Yvain rides 
through the entrance to the castle, a gate is shut in front of him. Another comes down just behind him 
and cuts his horse in half. Yvain is trapped. However, another “fair and charming maiden” appears and 
offers to hide him from the others in the castle who want to kill him. “Why are you tying to save me?” 
asks Yvain. She responds “Once my lady sent me on an errand to the King's court, and I suppose I was

INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
 
not as experienced or courteous or as well behaved as a maiden ought to be. At any rate, there was not a 
knight there who deigned to say a word to me except you alone who stand here now. You, in your 
kindness, honoured and aided me. For the honour you did me then I shall now reward you.” 
 
Kohlberg could use this situation in order to assign Lunete (the maiden) to a stage of moral 
development. How would he do that? What stage might he assign her to and why? Be sure to tell us how 
Kohlberg assigned people to moral stages. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12. (10) Either explain why Lunete’s altruistic behavior might be seen as hard to explain in 
evolutionarily psychological terms or give an evolutionary psych account for the behavior. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
13. (10) So, now Yvain is hidden inside the castle of the knight he has just killed. The people in the 
castle are looking for him so they can kill him. To make matters more complicated, he sees the widow of 
the man he killed and falls madly in love with her. He does not think this relationship is likely to work 
out “So he says: "I may consider myself a fool to wish for what I cannot have. Her lord it was whom I 
wounded mortally, and yet do I think I can be reconciled with her?” This is all rather stressful and he is 
soon mad with despair. Yvain seems to have this problem. When the stress increases, he goes “out of his 
mind”.  Other knights, in similar situations (this sort of thing happens all the time, you know), do not 
become “crazy”.  
 
Can you explain this in the context of the diathesis-stress model of illness? If the answer is “yes” please 
make sure that you define the diathesis-stress model for us. If the answer, is “huh?”, please explain 
Yvain’s tendency to lose his mind in some way that reveals some knowledge from this course (partial 
credit).

INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
 
14. (10) Even though the dead knight’s widow loved her late husband, Lunete’s plan is to get her to 
marry Yvain – you know, the guy who killed her husband. Though that may not seem like a match made 
in heaven, it works. Within about 600 lines of verse (this was an Old French poem), the widow is asking 
her people if she should remarry “They beseech her so insistently that she consents to what she would 
have done in any case. For Love bids her do that for which she asks counsel and advice” That is, she is 
not only going to marry Yvain within a month or so of the death of her husband but she is actually in 
love with Yvain. “So my lord Yvain is master now, and the dead man is quite forgot. He who killed him 
is now married to his wife” 
 
Now, to be honest, this does not terribly psychologically convincing.  However, if it was  going to 
happen, it would be a great example of attitude change. Even if you think that this example of attitude 
change is a bit extreme, please describe two things that Lunete might have done in order to change the 
widow’s mind. Now, we are thinking about Chapter 11 and cognitive dissonance theory, but you can use 
whatever works as long as your answer reveals knowledge of Psychology and not just random romantic 
speculation. BE SPECIFIC in your reference to material from the course. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15. (5) After some time, King Arthur and a number of other knights, come to the clearing. They toss 
water on the stone. The storm happens, the birds happen, and now it is Yvain who must ride to the 
defense of this little kingdom. He and Sir Gawain (representing Arthur) have the usual dual and 
everyone comes to watch. When Yvain’s new wife first hears Gawain’s sword ring as it hits Yvain, she 
screams and jumps. The second time she screams less loudly and jumps less dramatically. After a few 
more blows, she is not screaming or jumping. 
 
This is an example of 
 
a) reaction formation   
e) habituation   
 
 
16. (10) As Yvain and Gawain are fighting, Kay is making his usual nasty comments. He says that they 
are poor swordsmen and cowards and so forth. This is unpleasant to Yvain and Gawain. It so happens 
that when the fighting moves close to Kay, he stops talking. Without consciously deciding, Gawain and 
Yvain find themselves fighting down at Kay’s end of the field. Why? 
 
ANSWER                                     ____ predicts that the                                 of having Kay shut up will  
make it more likely that the fighters will move to Kay’s end of the field. (USE TERMS ON NEXT

d) negative reinforcement 
g) extinction 
 
 
h) cognitive constancy 
 
 
I) conditioned stimulus 
j) My best friend 
k) mere fact 
 
 
17. (15) Eventually Yvain and Gawain stop whacking each other. Only when they are exhausted do they 
have the brains to ask each other’s name. When Gawain realizes that this is Yvain, he can’t believe that 
Yvain has settled down to a life of married bliss guarding the storm stone. He wants Yvain to resume the 
life of a knight in Arthur’s court. Gawain rides back to King Arthur and the other knights and says “We 
must use what we know of Latané’s Social Impact Theory to get Yvain to come back with us. Arthur 
says “I recall that the initials of the three important factors in that theory spell ‘S.I.N.’ but I can’t 
remember any more. 
 
So help out Arthur (who really is a dotard in this work). Explain how Arthur and his knights can exploit 
each of these three factors to get Yvain to go back to court with them.

18. (5) Well, it worked. His new wife is not pleased. She thinks he has gone insane (again). Specifically, 
she decides that he has an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). She thinks he is subject to obsessive 
thoughts about Arthur’s court. We might not agree with the diagnosis but, if he had OCD, which of 
these treatments might be effective. 
 

a)  A drug like Prozac could break up the obsessive thought patterns. 
b)  A serotonin re-uptake inhibitor could reduce the obsessive thought patterns. 
c)  Behavioral psychotherapy could be effective. 
d)  There is no known effective treatment for OCD. 
e)  A & B   
f) A & B & C   
g) B & C 

h) phlegm, he needs more phlegm 

 
19. (5) Her ladies-in-waiting have a different theory. They think that he has an Authoritarian Personality. 
He is just too easily swayed when an authority figure like Arthur gives him a command. Which of the 
following facts support this idea that there is an Authoritarian Personality type. (ANS. NEXT PAGE)

a.  Freud’s followers showed that individuals with over-developed superegos tended to be willing to 
follow commands more willingly than other individuals.  
b.  Seligman’s work on Learned Helplessness shows that individuals (well, dogs, in any case) who are 
subject to unavoidable punishment become overly willing to follow orders. 
c.  Harlow’s work on social deprivation revealed that lack of comfort from a mother figure could lead to 
development of an authoritarian personality type. 
d.  Milgrim’s shock experiment showed that individuals with authoritarian personalities were more 
willing than others to administer higher shocks on the simple order of an white-jacketed authority 
figure. 
e.  B & C 
 
 
20. (10) The court magicians are very fond of the ideas of evolutionary psychology. They say that the 
evolutionary history of our species has exerted different pressures on men and women when it comes to 
sexual relationships. They think that evolutionary forces may explain why Yvain wants to leave and why 
Yvain’s wife wants him to stay. Please explain. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
21. (5) The Master of the Hawks thinks that Yvain needs to leave because he saw King Arthur during a 
“critical period” in his infancy. Now, when he sees Arthur, he has a reflexive need to follow him.  
 
This seems a little unlikely, but if it were true it would be an example of  
 
a) imprinting 
 
 
d) an anal stage fixation 
 
22. (5) Critical period was in quotes in the last question because it is a technical term. What does it 
mean? An example (not involving kings and knights) would probably help. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
23. (5) Eventually, Yvain’s wife says that he may go for a period of about a year. Yvain is very 
conflicted about leaving. He feels obligated to his king but he really does love his wife. Thus “My lord 
Yvain is so distressed to leave his lady that his right parietal cortex remains behind. The King may take 

b) an unconditioned response  
e) reaction formation

his body off, but he cannot lead his right parietal cortex away.” (Well, the translation says “heart” but I 
am pretty sure that the Old French original refers to the right parietal cortex.)  
 
If Yvain was to really ride away without his parietal cortex in his right hemisphere, which of the 
following symptoms would he be likely to exhibit? 
 

 

a)  he would be paralyzed on the right side of his body 
b)  he would be paralyzed on the left side of his body 
c)  he would not feel normal stimulation of the skin on the right side of his body 
d)  he would not feel normal stimulation of the skin on the left side of his body 
e)  TWO of the above (which two _____________) 
f)  None of the above 

 
24. (5) He would have visual abnormalities as well. Specifically,  
 

a)  he would be blind in his right eye 
b)  he would be blind in his left eye 
c)  he would be blind in the right half of visual space (He could not see anything to right of the point 
of fixation) 
d)  he would be blind in the left half of visual space (He could not see anything to left of the point of 
fixation) 
e)  none of the above 

 
25. (5) He would probably exhibit “contralateral  neglect”. What does that mean? 
 
 
 
 
 
26. (10) Eventually, Yvain’s parietal lobe catches up with him and he spends his year at court. One day, 
in the middle of another tournament, “Yvain suddenly had a thought which surprised him more than any 
that had occurred to him since he had taken leave of his lady, for he realized that he had broken his 
word, and that the limit of his leave was already exceeded.”  
 
He forgot that his time was up. How could this happen? Please explain how someone could forget a 
salient fact like this. There are MANY correct answers to this question. Just be sure that your answer 
makes specific use of material from this course.

27. (15) No matter what the reason, Yvain feels really bad. He feels worse when a damsel from his 
wife’s court appear to say that his wife “has seen clearly the treachery of him who pretended he was a 
faithful lover while he was a false and treacherous thief”. In great distress, “he goes away until he is far 
from the tents and pavilions. Then such a storm broke loose in his brain that he loses his senses”. 
 
Actually, he lost some very specific bits of his perceptual abilities. They are listed below. Please define 
and/or illustrate each. 
 

 

Motion parallax  

 
 
 
     Brightness constancy (or color constancy, either will do).  
 
 
 
      
     The ability to use size/texture as a depth cue (I am sure a picture would help)  
 
 
 
 
 
28. (5) After the acute phase of his insanity, he recovers to the point where he takes up a new career. He 
is the local madman for a hermit in the woods. He successfully kills deer and leaves them for the hermit 
to cook into dinner. Yvain does not remember who he is or where he came from but he is functioning in 
his new role. 
 
This sounds consistent with a diagnosis of  
 
a) paranoid schizophrenia 
d) a dissociative fugue state 
 
29. (5) He is found by a lady and the usual fair damsels. One of the damsels recognizes him as Yvain 
and they restore his wits with a useful ointment. He defeats an assortment of bad knights on behalf of his 
new patrons. However, he is still feeling guilty and despondent so he leaves and he “proceeded through 
a deep wood, until he heard among the trees a very loud and dismal cry … When he had arrived upon 
the spot, he saw in a cleared space a lion and a serpent which held him by the tail, burning his hind- 
quarters with flames of fire. 
 
It seems like the lion is experiencing “negative affect”.  We don’t know much about the emotional life 
of a lion but, if you were looking for the pieces of the brain in a human (or a lion, in fact) that would be 
involved in feeling scared and angry so forth, which of these would be most likely to be involved? 
 
a) amygdala 
d) thalamus 

c) post-traumatic stress disorder 
f) general paresis 

c) lateral geniculate nucleus 
f) corpus leonatus 

b) hippocampus 
 
e) inferotemporal cortex 

b) bipolar disorder

30. (20) Yvain kills the serpent. The lion is really grateful. He bows to Yvain. He weeps leonine tears of 
gratitude. He seems just about ready to speak but there are limits to the ability of animals to use 
language. Please describe the linguistic abilities of animals using all of the following terms: 
 
syntax  
 
Obviously, we want you to use each of these terms in a way that makes it clear that you know what they 
mean (Give a straight-forward definition if you are worried that we won’t guess what you know). 
AND 
Obviously, you do not need to describe the linguistic abilities of ALL animals. We are looking for 
something like this: 
 
“Many species show an ability to use fontax (the ability to change fonts in a word processor). For 
example, experiments on Swiss cows suggest that they may have an innate tendency to switch to 
Helvetica font.” 
 
Now just do something like that for the four terms above (Real examples – not knightly fiction) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
31. (5) Henceforth, the lion will be Yvain’s constant companion and Yvain begins to refer to himself as 
“The Knight with the Lion”. He and the lion make a good team. However, Yvain notices that, when they 
are fighting as a team (or participating in games like tug-o-war…hint, hint), he fights less vigorously 
than he would alone. This would be an example of 
 
a) narcissism   
d) stable attachment 
 
32. (10) Meantime back in the clearing with the basin and the stone and the storms, the lady who Yvain 
had married has a problem. She needs a defender. She can’t remarry because Yvain is still out there 
somewhere, so she decides to hire a knight. She needs to pick the right knight so she sends two damsels 
to KTS (the Knightly Testing Service) to ask for help. 

 
b) social loafing 
e) social learning theory 

c) the bystander effect 
f) nothing in particular

KTS offers the damsels the SPAT (Storm Prevention Aptitude Test). They point out that scores on the 
SPAT have a correlation of –0.85 with success as a knight. Knowing just that fact and assuming that the 
damsels are looking for a knight who will be “successful”, would the SPAT be useful as a tool for 
picking a successful knight for this job. PLEASE EXPLAIN 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
33. (5) The damsels don’t seem enthused about the SPAT. One of the damsels says that she has heard 
that that its reliability is low and its validity is also low. This is good jargon from the mental test field. 
What does it mean? 
 

a)  Low reliability means that some people cannot take the test. Low validity means that the test is 
constructed in a way that make it unlikely that someone will get comparable scores if they take 
the test twice. 
b)  In this case, low reliability means that the test does not measure “storm prevention” or “knightly 
success”.  Low validity means that the test cannot predict correlations between test takers. 
c)  Low reliability means that some people cannot take the test. Low validity means that scores from 
different knights will not be correlated with each other. 
d)  Low reliability means that the consistency with which the SPAT measures whatever it measures 
is low. Low validity means that the test does not measure what it is supposed to measure. 
e)  Low reliability means that damsels can’t rely on knights and it is time to take some self-defense 
courses. 

 
34. (10) Armed with the right test (whatever that may be), the damsels go to the town of Oxbridge to 
look for knights. There are two schools that train knights in Oxbridge and there are 100 pairs of identical 
twins in Oxbridge. For some reason, the custom is to send one twin to one school and the other to the 
other. So there are 100 student knights in each school - each knight with an identical sibling in the other 
school. The damsels give their test to all 200 student knights. 
 
The damsels analyze the correlation between scores of the 100 pairs of twins. Amazingly, that 
correlation is 1.00. They also compare the average scores from the two schools. Interestingly, they 
report that the average score in the first school is 50 points higher than the average score in the other 
school. Assume that there is no error in the scoring. Is this possible or do these “interesting” and 
“amazing”  facts contradict each other. Please explain. Pictures/graphs welcome but not required.

35. (5) If the damsels reported that the correlation was 2.0, what conclusions could you draw about the 
test or the damsels or the knights? 
 
 
 
 
36. (10) Please note that we do not know what the damsel’s test asks. Recall that the test produced a 
correlation of 1.00 for identical twins reared apart.  Pretend the twins were sent to knight school as soon 
as they were born and never saw the other twin. Would this correlation prove a strong genetic 
component to whatever the test was measuring or is there a possible entirely non-genetic account? 
Please explain. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
37. (10) If you look at questions 34 and 35, you will see that I never specified the gender of the knights 
in knight school. You probably inferred that they were male. They did not have to be. Joan of Arc was 
not male. I am reading another Arthurian Romance, entitled “Silence”, with a female knight. Why might 
you have assumed that these knights were male? Your answer should include the word “heuristic”. If it 
isn’t going to include that term, then make sure your answer includes some other good material from the 
course (for partial credit). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
38. (25) Meantime, Yvain and his lion are wandering around fighting bad guys and so forth. One 
evening they cannot find the usual castle to stay in. Instead, they end up in a humble cottage where the 
parents were just putting their children in bed for the night. Yvain asks if he can stay and the parents 
agree and they say “It is time for the children’s bedtime story and we have run out of stories. Can you 
tell them a story?”  Yvain says “Of course. I will tell them the story of knight of the swamp. I learned it 
from my grandmother.”…and here it is

Once upon a time there was a boy who lived with his mother in a small house at the edge of the 
forest. They were poor but they survived. One day, the mother said “Our goat no longer gives milk. 
We cannot afford to feed it at home any longer. Take it to the pasture on the other side of the 
woods and let your father add it to our little flock. So the boy took the goat and went into the 
woods. He was supposed to stay on the road but he saw something shining like a jewel deeper in the 
woods so he went to see what it was. The ground grew soft and something seemed to be gleaming in 
the mud. He dug and dug but he couldn’t find it and, when he looked up, he saw that the goat was 
gone. He returned home, covered in filth and, when his mother heard what he had done, she 
scrubbed him with stiff brush and sent him to bed with no dinner.  
 
The next day, the mother sent the boy into the woods to look for the goat. He searched and 
searched but found no goat. He thought he heard something in the swamp but when he looked, he 
found nothing and merely got covered in filth again. This happened on the third day and on the 
fourth and each time his mother became more angry and scrubbed him harder with the brush until his 
skin burned. 
 

On the fifth day, she flew into a rage and said “Go to the woods and do not come back without the 
goat!”. Again, he dug in the mud and again he found no goat but as he wandered, dirty and unhappy, 
he came upon a deep pool. A little man outside a small house by the side of the pool said “Look 
within and you may find what you need”. The boy looked into the pool and deep in its clear waters 
he could see the goat, alive and happy. However, when he jumped in the water, the filth that clung to 
him, muddied the water and hid the goat. When he got out, the water cleared but each time he tried 
to reach the goat, his vision was blocked by filth. And each time he asked the little man, the little man 
said “look within and you may find what you need.” 
 
After his seventh try, the boy  looked for the little man but saw no one. He went to look in  the small 
house but no one was in the house. All that he could find was a pail of water and a scrubbing brush. 
He scrubbed and scrubbed until his skin burned. Then he returned to the pool. Now, when he 
jumped in the waters were as clear as glass and his goat was waiting for him. When he pulled her out, 
seven other fat, healthy goats followed. They all returned with the boy to his mother. His mother 
was overjoyed to see him. She took back her goat but she let the boy keep and care for the seven 
new goats.

Suppose this was a “real” fairy tale (rather than one that I just wrote) - Bruno Bettleheim might want to 
interpret it in  Freudian context.  
 
Why? Please explain Bettleheim’s theory of the role of fairy tales. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Please interpret this fairy tale in the Freudian manner that Bettleheim used on classic fairy tales like 
Hansel and Gretel. In your answer, briefly summarize Freud’s theory of psychosexual development. 
What are the stages and what are the issues that appear during those stages. NOTE: There is no one 
correct account of this story. Just make sure that your answer reveals a good understanding of Freud’s 
theory and Bettleheim’s application of that theory in fairy tales. 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Well, Yvain saves Lunete from being burned and prevents some rapes and eventually finds his way back 
to his lady and her love….but I think we have had enough questions. So “now my lord Yvain is 
reconciled, and you may believe that, in spite of the trouble he has endured, he was never so happy for 
anything. All has turned out well at last; for he is beloved and treasured by his lady, and she by him. His
