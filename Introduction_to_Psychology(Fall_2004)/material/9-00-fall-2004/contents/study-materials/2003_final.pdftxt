Jean Baptiste Poquelin de Moliere was the great comic playwright of 17th century 
France. In 1662, he wrote “The School For Wives” in verse. In 1970, the American 
poet, Richard Wilbur, did a great verse translation. (Much more fun than the prose 
translations if you ever choose to read the play.) In 2003, we stole the plot for an 
Intro Psych exam. PLEASE NOTE: As on the midterm, the story is just the story, 
not the content of this exam. If you think that the story is confusing you, please ask 
and we will explain the meaning of any question. We are not trying to be tricky. 
Write your answers on the exam. Use the back of pages if needed. Good luck. 

1. (10 pts) When the play opens, Arnolphe is discussing his plan to marry. His friend
is concerned because Arnolphe has made a career of mocking "cuckolds", the 
husbands of unfaithful wives. (Apparently, there is a lot of marital infidelity in this 
town.) He seems uninterested in the possibility that some husbands might be 
unfaithful. Evolutionary Psychology proposes that men and women should think 
differently about sexual fidelity in relationships. Please explain and, while you are at 
it, please tell us if your answer explains why Arnolphe is only mocking the men.

 2. (5) Arnolphe's friend warns him that it is dangerous for him to marry because
"If the least whisper about your wife were heard, 
They'd mock you from the housetops, mark my word." 
That is, the husbands he mocked would be eager to mock him. 

This would be an example of 
a)  reciprocity in social exchange 
b)  arousal in the James-Lange theory of Emotion 
c)  a type of setpoint in Bowle's theory of motivation 
d)  an "impact" in social impact theory 
e)  all of the above 
f)  none of the above 

If you need to (and only if you need to) briefly explain your answer.

3. (5) Arnolphe thinks he has a sure way to guarantee that his wife will be faithful. He plans to marry a
girl who is not very bright.

"So simple is the girl I am going to wed, 

I have no fear of horns upon my head." 

(Horns were the classic symbol of a husband with an unfaithful wife).

He is convinced that she is not smart because she scored low on the WWT (the Wifely Wits Test). He

says that the test is "perfectly reliable".


If he was using the term "reliable" in the technical sense that would be used in describing a test, then 
"perfectly reliable" means 

a)  that the test would produce the same score for the same person every time you administered it (as 
long as the person's abilities didn't change). 
b)  that the test measured what it was supposed to measure (here, something like intelligence). Of 
course, this assumes that what is measured is well-defined. 
c)  that the test is useful for the purpose for which it is given. In this case, it means that the test is a 
useful predictor of faithfulness even though it is overtly a test of intelligence. 
d)  Actually, it doesn't mean anything. The idea of test reliability was discredited by research in the 
last 20 years. 
e)  Nah, it just means that your insurer will pay for the test. 
f)  None of the above 

4. (5) His friend says that the test may be reliable but its validity is questionable. If he was using the 
term "validity" in the technical sense that would be used in describing a test, then "validity" means 

a)  that the test would produce the same score for the same person every time you administered it (as 
long as the person's abilities didn't change). 
b)  that the test measured what it was supposed to measure (here, something like intelligence). Of 
course, this assumes that what is measured is well-defined. 
c)  that it is morally acceptable to give this test for this purpose. 
d)  That the questions have been tested on children to show that the test correctly tracks their

development.

e)  A valid test is just like a valid license. It hasn't expired yet.

f)  None of the above.


5. (10) Well, none of this matters, says Arnolphe, because scores on the test correlate with the
faithfulness of wives. He says that low scores on the WWT predict high levels of fidelity and high 
scores predict low fidelity. He says that this is a "negative correlation". Is he using the idea of 
correlation correctly? Any errors in here? Please explain. PLEASE NOTE: This is a question about 
correlation. You may assume that the WWT measures something and, for these purposes, that you can 
also measure faithfulness.

6. (15) Arnolphe's friend says that marrying a stupid woman is a mistake because intelligence is largely
inherited and a stupid mother will have innately stupid children. What do you think of this argument? 
Please cite THREE pieces of evidence that are relevant to the question of the heritability of intelligence. 
NOTE: You do not have to have The Correct view on this question. You can argue either side. Indeed, 
we would be happy to have evidence from both sides if you want. Make sure you are citing evidence and 
not just opinion. 

 YOUR NAME_____________________ 

7. (10) Arnolphe's friend also worries

"How can you expect an idiot 
To know what's virtuous and what is not? 
… 
If a bright woman breaks her wedding vow 
She knows what she is doing, anyhow. 
A simpleton, however, can commit 
Adultery without suspecting it." 

Arnolphe disagrees. He believes in his own version of the availability heuristic. What the girl does not 
know about, she will not do. That’s not quite right. Could you please define the availability heuristic a 
bit more clearly and give one example?

8. (10) The friend goes on to argue that Social Exchange Theory argues that this marriage will not be a
success. Arnolphe says that he can make it a success in social exchange terms. Arguably, they are both 
correct. There are problems here from a social exchange point of view. But Social Exchange does point 
to possible solutions. Please state the social exchange problem and a possible solution. 

9. (5) Well, problem or no problem, Arnolphe is not going to be talked out of this. He loves his plan. His
bride-to-be, Agnes, has been raised by nuns out in the country. His original plan was that she should not 
be exposed to human language until she was 13 but the nuns talked him out of this. That is good because 
if they deprived her of exposure to human language until that age, 

a)  She would have never acquired the ability to speak a syntactically correct language. 
b)  She would have acquired a normal first language but have been unable to ever acquire a normal 
second language. 
c)  Her language would have been syntactically regular but would have been largely without 
morphemic structures.

d)  She would have had only generative grammar.

e)  She would have only spoken in pig Latin.


10. (5) Arnolphe actually took Agnes away from her mother when she was little in an effort to raise her
in isolation in order to produce the wife of his dreams. If he had been reading about Harry Harlow's 
experiments on monkeys raised without social attachments (p516ff in Gleitman), he might have worried 
about this plan a bit because Harlow's monkeys reared in isolation had problems. Which of these is/are 
consequences of deprivation? 

a)  They tended to withdraw, huddle and rock themselves, and even bite themselves. 
b)  The females tended to be sexually aggressive. They initiated mating which is not typical for the 
species. 
c)  When they gave birth, the mothers seemed to have no trace of love for their offspring. 
d)  The females tended to be dominant and adulterous, hardly what Arnolphe was looking for. 
g) all of the above 
f) B & D 
e)  A & C

11. (5) You could have advised him about the relevance of the Harlow studies by saying

a)  He should worry because there is evidence of abnormal development in children raised in 
socially impoverished environments (e.g. the Romanian orphanages described on p517). 
b)  He should not worry because the evidence from those orphanages actually shows that humans 
are not like monkeys and did not show deficits from severe deprivation. 
c)  Assuming that the nuns provided at least an "adequate quality" of care, Agnes would have grown 
up without serious harm. 
d)  Actually, the evidence is that even so-called "adequate care" in orphanages produces long term 
cognitive and social damage. 
e)  A & C 
f) B & D 

g) all of the above and several other things too. 

12. (5) In the second scene of act one, Arnolphe goes to visit Agnes. He has put her up in a house where
she is attended by two servants, Georgette and Alain, who he picked because they were just about as dim 
as he thought Agnes should be. He decided to train them using the rules of operant conditioning (or 
instrumental conditioning - same thing). He remembered (from his Intro. Psych. course) that a variable 
ratio schedule of reinforcement produces a high output of the conditioned behavior. So, from the first 
day that they worked for him, he paid his servants on average every 2 weeks. Sometimes he would wait 
7 days, sometimes 21, and so forth. He was disappointed. They did not seem to work hard. 

Assume that the servants are governed by the same rules as pigeons or rats. What is the problem here? 
What did Arnolphe forget? 

b)  He forgot that you need to shape the desired behavior gradually.

c)  He forgot what a variable ratio schedule is. This is variable interval.

d)  He forgot that variable schedules of reinforcement only work in classical conditioning settings.

e)  He forgot that variable schedules of reinforcement only work under conditions of aversive

conditioning.

g)  B & C 
f) B & D 
f)  A & B 
i)  None of the above (so, explain the real problem)


h) A & D


13. (10) Suppose we did not assume that servants are governed by the same rules as pigeons or rats. Is
there any evidence that the rules of operant (instrumental) conditioning influence the behavior of 
humans? Please give two concrete examples. These do not need to be experiments but they do need to 
be clear examples of some aspect of conditioning.

14. (5) Alain and Georgette tend to settle their arguments by hitting each other. After Georgette
clobbered Alain with a frying pan, he spent several days with an odd set of symptoms. He would only 
eat food on the right side of his plate. He would claim that objects or people in his left visual field were 
not present. Testing by the local doctor showed that he could still see stimuli in the left field. For 
example, he could say there was a light on if an isolated light was presented to the left in an otherwise 
dark room. So, he can see, but when dealing with the real world, he just denies that the left side of the 
world is there. This would be called 

a)  neglect 
b) prosopagnosia 
c) visual aphasia 

d)  hysteria (because no neurological damage could produce this problem) 

e) dysbrainia


15. (5) and the brain damage (if any) would most likely be in
b) left parietal lobe 
a)  right parietal lobe 
c) right frontal lobe  d) left frontal lobe 
e)  right occipital lobe 
f) left occipital lobe 
g)  none because hysteria is not the product of a focal brain lesion 
h)  the inferosuperior rostro-caudal ventricle 
i)  Minneapolis 

16. (5) It takes a long time and a lot of yelling before Alain and Georgette will let Arnolphe into the
house.  He thinks that they may have lost the ability to produce and understand speech. The technical 
term for this would be 

a) aphasia 

b) agnosia 

c) dysphoria  d) prosopagnosia  e) bushwhacked 

17. (10) Eventually, he does get in and he asks Georgette if Agnes was sad when he went away (He has
been away for ten days). She says ‘yes’. He asks why. She says that Agnes was sad because “she 
expected to see you return every minute; and we never heard an ass or a mule pass by without thinking it 
was you.” We may presume Georgette did not mean to make an association between her boss and mules 
and asses. It just came out that way. This speech error might be considered to be a “Freudian slip”. 
Freud was very interested in speech errors of this sort. Why? 

18. (10) Even Freud realized that not all speech errors should be considered “Freudian slips”. If they are
not “Freudian” , what else could they be? Feel free to give an example or two as part of your 
explanation.

19. (15) Arnolphe sees Agnes. She seems suitably simple and willing. He is happy. He goes back out on
the street and meets Horace. Horace is the son of an old friend of Arnolphe’s. Horace has just come to 
town. He went looking for Arnolphe but Arnolphe was out of town. So he went for a walk. As he was 
walking across a bridge past Agnes’ house,  something makes his heart race. Let’s assume it was just 
something he ate but he does not know that the food caused this reaction. All he knows is that his heart 
is racing, that he is on a bridge, and that he is looking at a girl. Depending on which chapter / lecture we 
were thinking about, this scenario could be used to explain why Horace develops an anxiety/panic 
disorder OR why he falls in love with Agnes. 

Your job is to explain each possibility. 

20. (10) While he is contemplating whether to fall in love or have a panic attack, William James comes
up and says that the James-Lange theory of emotion would not expect this to be an ambiguous situation. 
Please explain the James-Lange theory AND explain why it would consider this fictional choice 
between love and panic to be bogus.

INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY 
21. (10) Regardless of the  “correct” theory of emotion,  Horace has fallen in love with Agnes. He tells 
all of this to Arnolphe. Oh….we need to explain. Arnolphe calls himself “de la Souche” at Agnes’ house 
but his old friends still call him Arnolphe. So Horace is explaining his love to Arnolphe without 
knowing that Arnolophe is Agnes’ guardian and would-be husband (oops). Recall that Arnolphe was 
very happy at his home before this. Now, he says to the audience, “I shall burst with rage!” Then he 
makes a little plan to drive Horace away. It seems to work and, back at home, he says, “My joy is 
extreme.” 

Hmmm…Happy, then rage, then happy –  Dr. Racine declares that this sounds like “bipolar disorder”. 
Does it? Please explain why you would or not diagnose “bipolar disorder” in this case. Be sure that your 
answer makes clear that you know something about mental illness in general and bipolar disorder in 
particular. 

22. (10) Dr. Lully says that Dr. Racine is out of his mind. He also says that Arnolphe is out of his mind. 
Specifically, he notes that there is a split between two parts of Arnolphe’s  personality. On the street, he 
is filled with rage.  At home, he is happy. Split = schizo, mind = phrenes. Lully says that Arnolphe is a 
schizophrenic. Is that a good diagnosis? Please explain in a manner that makes it clear that you know 
how to define schizophrenia. 

23. (5) The reason that Arnolphe is happy is that he ran to Agnes’ home, told everyone that Horace was
not to be admitted, and when Horace came to see Agnes, she threw a brick at him. It hit Horace in the 
head. At least, Horace thinks it hit him in the head. When he meets Arnolphe again, on the street, Horace 
says he cannot remember being hit and he cannot remember the next 20 minutes of his life after being 
hit, even though he was conscious. This inability to remember the next 20 minutes would be called 

a) anterograde amnesia 
d) retrograde aphasia 

b) proactive aphasia  c) retrograde amnesia 
e) Brick’s palsy

24. (5) Arnolphe says that all of this must be rather depressing for Horace. Horace says that, no, actually
he feels great. He thinks that one reason is that being hit in the head with a brick is a little like 
Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) and ECT is used as an anti-depressant therapy. You say: 
a)  Could be true: In both cases, you get transient disruption of the normal electrical activity of the 
brain. 
b)  Could be true: In both cases there can be memory problems. 
c)  Nonsense: ECT is a treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder and is specifically NOT useful 
for treatment of depression. 
d)  Nonsense: Inspite of the name, ECT does not produce a seizure or convulsions. It is used to 
adjust ionic balance in brain ventricles. 
e)  A & B 
f) C & D 
g) Actually, ECT stands for Evil Chemistry Test. 

25. (10) Actually, there is another reason why Horace is not depressed. Agnes attached a love note to the
brick. In the letter, there is a list of all the things that Agnes likes. She likes: puppies, roses, kittens,
milk, chicks, ducklings, daisies, pillows, clouds, snow, sugar, ribbons, cake, and pickles.  After 
Arnolphe reads the letter, he asks Horace if he can remember the whole list. Please tell us how many 
items you think Horace can remember and, unless you are arguing that he remembers all of the items, 
please say which items are most likely to be remembered. NOTE: There are MANY possible answers to 
this question but any GOOD answer will include an explanation based on facts about memory learned in 
this course (rather than ad hoc speculations about Horace’s taste for pickles, for example). 

26. (5) After reading the letter, Arnolphe give Horace a big hug and says, “I love you like a son.” This
sounds a bit odd. It sounds like a Freudian defense mechanism. Which one? 
a) reaction formation 
d) reversion 
c) projection 
b) denial 
e) I don’t know but, look, I will define a couple of defense mechanisms in the hopes of getting a couple 
of points. 

27. (10) What is a Freudian defense mechanism? Who or what is being defended? Against what?

28. (5) Her note also says that she has been taught that “all young men are deceivers” and that she will
end up as a “date rape” statistic if she ever goes out with a guy. That seems a little overstated. A fairer 
statement would be 

 YOUR NAME_____________________ 

a)  Males convicted of date rape offenses have a similar psychological profile as those convicted of 
“blitz rape” (e.g. stranger in the bushes attackers). 
b)  Males convicted of date rape offenses are systematically different from the “normal” population 
on personality tests.

c)  Date rape is strongly correlated with the viewing of violent pornography.

29. (10) Horace leaves. Arnolphe is upset. He stands on the bridge and stares at the river. It is flowing
from the bottom to the top of his visual field (Right? You can imagine this. He is looking over the edge 
of the bridge, the water is coming from under the bridge and flowing away.) He stares for several 
minutes. Then he looks at the house where Agnes is living. It seems to be moving. Please describe the 
direction of motion and explain why it looks like it is moving. NOTE: Naming the effect is NOT an 
explanation, though the name would be good. 

30. (5) He decides that his best plan is to go home and get some sleep. After two hours or so he wakes
up out of a vivid, narrative dream. Which of the following is true? 

a)  The narrative dream most likely occurred during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep even though 
some dreaming appears to occur in non-REM sleep. 
b)  Two hours would have been long enough to go through a complete circadian cycle. 
c)  During the narrative dreaming stage of sleep, muscle tone for the main muscle groups of the 
body returns to its normal, awake state (even though the sleeper remains asleep). 
d)  If he did wake up out of a dream, this would be unusual since dreaming sleep is usually a late 
night / early morning phenomenon occurring only after several hours of sleep. 
e)  A two hour nap proves that Arnolphe is not an MIT student. 
h) None of the above

the royal road to the unconscious. If Arnolphe was his patient, how might this dream be used in 
analysis? Please make sure that your answer shows that you know why we dream according to Freud 
and how dream material could be used in psychoanalysis.

32. (10) Freud wrote about this in 1900. More recent research raised major problems with Freud's theory
of dreams. Please describe one of these problems. What does this mean for Freudian dream theory? 
Should we abandon it? Should we adapt it to the new findings?  If so, how? There is no correct opinion 
for this answer. We are looking for evidence that you know some facts and can form an intelligent 
opinion, whatever that may be. 

33. (10) As he lies on his bed, Arnolphe sees a pattern on his ceiling that
looks something like the pattern here.  He notices that this looks like 
three lines that cross each other. He realizes that it takes an effort to see, 
for example, four separate line segments meeting near the "a" on the left. 
He also notices that any intersections near the "b" on the right side appear 
to be covered up by a white blob but that "blob" isn't really there. It is the 
same white as the background.

34. (5) There are some other odd shapes like clouds or inkblots on the ceiling. If he described what he
saw to a psychologist who then used this to assess his mental state, we would say that these shapes on 
the ceiling were being used as 

b) a situationalist test 
a) a projective personality test 
c) an affective processing test 
d) a structured personality test 
e) a do-you-need-to-paint-the-ceiling test 

35. (10) Concerned that he has not adequately trained Agnes’ servants / guards, Arnolphe goes back to
her house to discuss proper procedures. He asks them about, 
“…what distress you would feel, what shame 
If some dishonor touched your master’s name?” 
He goes on to ask what they would do if Horace offered them a monetary bribe for the chance to spend 
some time with Agnes. They demonstrate that they would take Horace’s money and then hit him on the 
head. 

This is a moral choice (of sorts). How would Kohlberg decide what moral stage Alain and Georgette 
were in? If you have no idea about Kohlberg’s stages of moral development, try giving us a quick 
review of Freud’s views on the subject. That should be good for some credit.

Arnolphe storms around in Agnes room in a huge rage,

“Kicking a little dog who yipped in fright.

And throwing her possessions left and right.”


Of course, everyone speculates about the neurophysiological underpinnings of this anger. Who is most

likely to be correct?


a)  Agnes votes for increased frequency of action potentials in the amygdala.

b)  Alain thinks that it is the increased magnitude of the action potentials in the limbic system.

c)  Georgette believes that there has been a decrease in the activity of inhibitory neurotransmitters.

d)  The dog votes for a functional disconnection between the cerebral hemispheres.

e)  A & C 
f) B & D 
g) A, B & C  h) all of these could be true.

f)  Horace thinks it is a case of demonic neuronal transplantation.


37. (5) Horace is stuck in the closet with a crazy guy threatening to rip him apart. This produces anxiety
that turns into a phobia about enclosed spaces.  He needs to get this treated so he goes to a therapist who 
specializes in behavior therapy. Which of the following methods would be labeled as “behavioral 
therapy” for a phobia? 

c) interpersonal therapy 
b) transference 
a) desensitization 
d) psychosurgery 
e) electroconvulsive therapy  f) pharmacotherapy 
g)  Any of these could be a behavioral therapy because the term just refers to therapy for abnormal 
behavior. The methodology is unimportant.

39. (10) The noise from the house is starting to attract attention in the neighborhood. Three women
gather outside to discuss the problem. They decide that Arnolphe has to be convinced that his opinions 
about and his actions toward women must change. The first woman declares that the Social Impact 
Theory gives some good ideas about how to influence Arnolphe. Please suggest a method for getting 
Arnolphe to behave better. Your method should illustrate the three principles of Social Impact Theory 
(and your answer should make it clear that you know what those factors mean. Don’t make us guess. It 
would be a SIN if you forgot the factors … Hint, Hint). 

40. (5) Poor Agnes is so stressed out that she reverts to childhood. Specifically, she begins to behave
like a child in Piaget’s Pre-operational stage of development. If that were so (and Piaget was correct), 
which of the following should be true 

a)  She would be unable to take points of view other than her own (egocentric behavior).

b)  She would behave as though objects went out of existence when they went out of sight.

c)  She would be able to use 2-word syntactic structure but not more complex forms.

d)  While this would not have been possible in an earlier stage, she is now able to generalize rules

(e.g. even + 1 is always odd).
e)  All of the above 
f) none of the above


41. (10) But we don’t think Piaget was completely correct. For example, Piaget said that Pre-operational
kids lack an idea of number but there is evidence that very young children can manipulate number 
concepts. Please describe experimental evidence for something like mathematical ability in babies. If 
this doesn’t ring any bells, describe any experimental evidence that contradicts Piaget. Make sure we 
know why you picked what you picked. What was Piaget’s claim? What is the counterevidence?

43. (5)  As she calms down, Agnes ages psychologically. Eventually she reaches the most common age 
of onset for the eating disorder, anorexia nervosa. What age would that be? 

44. (10) Since she is the right (virtual) age for anorexia, we should worry about this. What are the risk
factors for anorexia? I can think of lots of them. You should list at least four.

46. (10) Finally, Agnes returns to her normal state. With shock she realizes that we have reached the end
of the exam and that no one has asked the question that you, the test-taker, have been dying to answer. 
Apparently, you memorized some term or set of terms and never got to use them. Now is your chance. 
Define two terms from the course - two that have NOT been used as answers so far. If you can do that, 
you get 10 more points and you can quit!  Happy Holidays.
