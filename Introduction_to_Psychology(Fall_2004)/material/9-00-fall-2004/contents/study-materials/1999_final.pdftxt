Concourse 9.00 - Introduction to Psychology 1999 
Love's Labours Lost  
but not Psych. Labours Lost (320 points) 

 
I have heard that there is a forthcoming Kenneth Branagh film of this play 
so I thought it would make a good topic for the final. The play just 
provides the story line for this final. You do not need to know the play or 
Shakespearean English. If any question seems confusing, just ask about it. 
Use the back of the paper if you need to. Just tell us where to find the 
answer. You should have plenty of time to complete this.  Good luck. 
 
1. (10 points) Here is the situation in Act 1 Scene 1. The King of Navarre 
(on the Spanish/French border, by the way) has made a deal with three 
noblemen, Berowne, Longaville,  and Dumain. It is a sort of proto-MIT 
deal. The plan to study for three years, making  
 
"war against your own affections 
And the huge army of the world's desires,--" (act 1,scene 1... henceforth, 
just 1,1) 
 
They are going to give up good food, women, and sleep in order to study. 
Almost immediately, Berowne  objects to the plan  "to sleep but three 
hours in the night, And not be seen to wink of all the day (meaning no naps 
in class)" (1,1) The others argue that he is a coward. What do you think 
will happen if they try to stick to a schedule of just 3 hours of sleep per 
day? Please defend your answer with material from the course, NOT 
merely with personal anecdotes about the need for sleep.

2. (5) The four 'students' begin to argue about the details of their agreement. Does the 
contract ban sleep or just rapid eye movement sleep? Suppose that contract bans REM 
sleep, but not slow wave sleep, which of the following are true (pp100ff)?  
 
a.  Restorative sleep will be reduced but dreaming sleep will be unaffected. 
b.  This is not possible. You cannot selectively eliminate or even markedly reduce the 
amount of REM sleep relative to slow-wave sleep. 
c.  This is stupid. REM sleep is the same as slow-wave sleep. 

d.  This is fine. You can eliminate REM sleep. Moreover, there are no noticeable effects 
of REM deprivation. For example, the percentage of REM sleep after 2 weeks of 
REM deprivation is the does not increase over the percentage of REM before 
deprivation. 
e.  This is stupid, there is no such thing as sleep. 
f.  Stupid or not, none of the answers above are true. 
 
 
3. (5) Berowne is feeling a lot of social pressure to agree to this study plan. Three 
guys...one of them a king....all telling him that he should agree. Latané's Social Impact 
Theory seems to capture Berowne's situation. Latané theory proposes three factors that 
modulate the total impact. Those are: (Pick three and only three. No partial credit, p517). 
 
a. Number  - the number of people who effect the target individual 
b. Sex - whether the people are same sex or different 
c. Immediacy - how close the people are in space or time. 
d. Interest - how interesting the topic is to the subject of the impact 
e. Strength - how powerful/authoritative are the people exerting the pressure? 
f. Sympathy - how likable are the people exerting the pressure? 
g. Nuturance - how nurturing/supportive is the subject of the pressure? 
 
4. (10) Pick one of these factors and explain how it could be changed in this situation to 
REDUCE the social pressure on Berowne. Then give one example of experimental data 
that supports your explanation. Here is an example of the sort of answer we want (using a 
bogus factor): 
 
Let's manipulate the "speciation" factor. Social pressure on Berowne would be reduced if 
his friends and the king were turned into dogs (another species). This hypothesis is 
supported by the experiment in which researchers compared the persuasiveness of 
speeches by worms, dogs, and humans on worms, dogs, and humans. In all cases, same-
species speeches were most effective." OK...now you do the same for number, sex, or 
whatever. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. (10) Pick a different one of the factors from #3 and explain how it could be changed in 
this situation to INCREASE the social pressure on Berowne. Then give one example of 
experimental data that supports your explanation. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. (10) To make it easier to stay away from women, the men have banned women from 
the court (on pain of losing their tongues). However, as Berowne notes, the daughter of 
the King of France is scheduled to arrive tomorrow. Oops! Or as the king says "What say 
you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot." What sort of memory is this that has been 
forgotten? 
a. semantic     b. episodic    c. implicit    d. subconscious      e. unconscious 
f. You know, this is tricky. I am not sure any of these is correct. Let me explain (briefly).  
 
In fact, please explain your answer (briefly) even if you pick something from items a-e. 
Your explanation should make it clear that you understand the term you chose (or refused 
to chose). 
 
 
7. (5) Berowne comments 
 
So study evermore is overshot: 
While it doth study to have what it would 
It doth forget to do the thing it should, (1,1).......... 
 
umm...yeah...great...What that means is that there is a lessened ability to recall old 
material (the arrival of the princess) because of material learned subsequently (p281). 
This is called: 
 
a. psychogenic amnesia 
 
 
c. proactive inhibition (or interference) 
e. reaction formation   
 
 
 
8. (10) In the end, Berowne agrees to sign up. He then asks what they will do for fun. The 
king responds that there is a man at court named Armado who speaks very strangely. He 
has " a mint of phrases in his brain" (1,1). He makes up new words. He speaks with an 
elaborate but odd syntax. He says things like "Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and 
sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god, and body's fostering patron." (1,1) when 
he means to be saying 'Greetings, King.').  Dumain says that he has heard the Armado did 
not learn to speak until he was twelve and that is why is language is so odd and complex. 
Is Dumain's theory reasonable? Why or why not? Be sure that your answer reveals some 

b. iatrogenic amnesia 
d. retroactive inhibition (or interference) 
f. being "dumber than dirt" 

knowledge about the psychology of language and language development. We don't just 
want some speculation about this story. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
9. (5) Well, says Longaville, at least Armado is better than the character who was in the 
court of Navarre last year saying things like  "I hinkly glomped a flingly binter with a 
slorg". As an example of English, this is an utterance that has 
 
b. phonology without normal syntax 
 
a. morphology without phonology 
d. semantic form without syntactic content 
c. syntax without semantic content 
 
e. a phonological loop without a syntactic sketchpad  
f. a URL without a webpage 
 
10. (5) At this point, Costard (a comic character) comes in. He is under arrest because he has 
been "taken with a maid". This is illegal because the king has imposed his 'no women' rule on the 
entire court. There is a (very funny) letter from Armado that serves as eye witness testimony in 
this case. Costard wants to defend himself by claiming that the evidence is lousy. Armado claims 
that he saw Costard and a women named Jaquenetta doing something in the evening. The light 
was dim. In fact, these were scotopic light levels. That means that only the rod photoreceptors 
were functioning. Costard uses this to make several claims. 
 
Claim 1: Armado would have had trouble seeing what was going on because visual acuity 
is greatly reduced under scotopic conditions. This claim is  
 
a.  False, rod acuity can be essentially the same as cone (photopic) acuity as long as the 
light level is not too low (which it is not). 
b.  True, because rods are largely absent from the fovea. 
c.  False, because rods are not relevant to visual acuity. That is a brain/visual cortex issue. 
d.  True, because rods are not connected to ganglion cells in the retina and so do not have 
normal output to visual cortex. 
e.  False. because if you spare the rod you spoil the child. 
 
11. (5) Claim 2: Armado has also said that he knew it was Costard because he recognized 
Costard's blue and green stripped shirt.  This claim is: 
 a.  False, because rods are only sensitive to long-wavelength "red" light. 

b.  False, because the light reaching the eye does not contain adequate information for color 
vision under scotopic conditions. The wavelength information is physically disrupted. 
c.  False, because there is only a single type of rod photopigment and, as a consequence, 
scotopic lights cannot be discriminated on the basis of wavelength. 
d.  True, because, while long wavelengths like red are not seen by the rods, blue and green can 
be seen and discriminated between under scotopic conditions. 
e.  True because scotopic vision cannot hide awful taste in clothes. 
f.  a & c    
g. a & b 
h. a, b, & c 
12. (10) Suppose that Armado claimed to have recalled/recovered this previously hidden 
memory while under hypnosis. Would you regard such testimony as reliable. Why or 
why not. NOTE: Either "yes" or "no" can be the start of correct answers. Please defend 
your answer with two, specific pieces of evidence drawn from the material of this course.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
13. (10) Costard is sentenced to fast for a week on bran and water. He claims that this 
restrictive diet will cause his corpus callosum to break, thus severing the connections 
between his two cerebral hemispheres. OK, this wouldn't really happen, but suppose it 
did. What behavioral test could we do to show that Costard was now a "split-brain" 
patient. Behavioral means no looking inside the skull with imaging tools, etc. Be specific 
and be careful. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14. (10) In the next scene, we actually meet Armado. He is accompanied by his servant, a 
small boy named "Moth". He is a clever lad but his thinking seems a little strange at 
times. He can add 1+2 and get three (faster than his master). He knows that 3 - 1 is 2. 
However, he has real trouble with larger numbers.  Thus, he cannot handle 5-3 or 4+2, 
etc. Is this observation consistent with Piaget's theory of cognitive development? Please 

explain your answer. If your answer is yes, please tell us what developmental stage Moth 
is in (ANSWER ON NEXT PAGE). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15. (10) Armado has a problem:  "I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is 
       base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a base wench." (2,1) 
 
That is, he is in love and he is in love with a women who is his social inferior. So what is 
the problem?  We are looking for a Social Exchange Theory answer (p491ff). However, 
if you don't have one of those, you can get 8 of 10 points with any answer that clearly 
contains relevant material from this course. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
16. (10) So, what is Armado going to do about his love? He says 
 
       Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme, 
       for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit; 
       write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio. (2,1) 
 
That is, he is going to write poetry to her. Why would he do this? His love sounds a lot 
like lust. So why is he turning to sonnets rather than to more direct action? What would 
Freud say? Your answer should include four of the following terms, used intelligently.  
 
Id, ego, superego, preconscious, defense mechanism, reaction formation, displacement, 
repression. (answer on next page) 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
17. (5)  In the next scene, the princess of France appears with three ladies. They discuss 
the king and his three male companions. They establish that Maria knows and likes 
Longaville, Katherine knows Dumain, and Rosaline - Berowne. "God bless my ladies! 
are they all in love?" asks the princess. It is certainly very convenient - one woman for 
one man. Suppose we give all 4 women and all 4 men a lot of tests: Intelligence tests, 
personality tests, assessments of beauty, etc. Now we look at the correlation of the scores. 
That is, each data point is going to represent one male-female pair. A sample is shown 
below: 

high

A C
D

female score

B

high
male   sco re

A = Princess & King
B = Maria &  Longaville
C = Katherine & Dumain
D = Rosaline& Berowne

 
To begin, this looks like 
a)   A positive correlation  
c) A near zero correlation 
b) A negative correlation   
d)   A Dumb Question.  You can't have a correlation coefficient with 4 data points 
a.  A Dumb Question: You can't correlate male and female scores. 
 
18. (10) Suppose we were to look at the correlations of all of these factors in couples who 
had been happily together for 5 years. What do you think the data would look like? 
Please explain your answer in a way that reflects material in this course. Another social 
exchange theory answer would be fine but you can draw on other parts of the course, too. 
 
 
 
19. (5) Berowne has known Rosaline for quite a while. By the end of Act 3, Scene 1, he 
has written a love poem to her (There is a lot of that going around here.) He is 
embarrassed by this fact because he has been "love's whip", He has mocked lovers. He 
has loudly denied loving Rosaline. This sounds a lot like what Freud would call 
 
a. counter-transference 
c. unconscious inference 
e. reaction formation   
 
20. (10) Berowne is not happy so he goes to his therapist who practices Freudian 
psychoanalytic methods. As part of his treatment, she gets him to free associate. Please 
describe free association and explain how it plays a role in psychoanalytic psychotherapy.  

b. under-the-counter-transference 
d. projection 
f. fixation reaction 

 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
21. (5) In Act 4, Scene 1, we return to the French ladies. We hear the Princess ask 
 

pupil 

otoliths 

cornea 

cochlea 

lens 

fovea 

hair cells 

ganglion cell 

Was that the king, that spurred his horse so hard 
             Against the steep uprising of the hill? (4,1) 
 
Apparently, she could not quite tell. Her visual acuity was adequate to resolve the horse 
but not adequate to tell the difference between the king and some other rider. Half of the 
following terms refer to bits of the visual system that could influence visual acuity. Circle 
those five items. One point for each correct item. Minus one point for each incorrect item. 
OK, we won't let this question reduce your overall total. The minimum is zero points.

corpuscle 
22. (10) While they wait to find out if they will be allowed to enter the court of Navarre, 
French women play at word games. For instance, they play a word completion game 
where you have to quickly finish a word given a few cues. So PSY____ might get 
quickly completed as PSYCHOLOGY. When Katherine is given DU____ as a stem to 
complete, she comes up with DUMAIN (The guy she likes). This is interesting because 
DUMAIN is a much less common word than DUKE or DUNE or, even, DUNCE. This 
could be an example of priming. Priming comes in many forms. Many of these are 
considered to be examples of implicit memory. Please give two pieces of evidence to 
support the idea that priming can be an example of implicit memory. Please be sure that 
your answer makes it clear that you know what implicit memory is. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

23. (10) By now, there is a lot of love poetry going around. Various fools are being asked to 
deliver these declarations of love so, of course, they are going to the wrong people. Just when 
you thought you were confused enough, Shakespeare introduces two new characters. Sir 
Nathaniel and Holofernes. Holofernes is a great scholar. Well, he thinks he is a great scholar.  
Holofernes has been studying the mental state of the king and his friends.  
 
The king, he declares, is schizophrenic. He notes that schizophrenia means "split mind" and the 
mind of the king is obviously divided between his royal duties and his love for the princess of 
France. In fact, behind his back, people say that the king is like two people "His Royal 
Highness" and "Lover Boy". This has made it hard for him to get his official job done. Also, 
the king is melancholy (depressed) because the princess does not seem to return his love. This 
"inappropriate affect" is also a symptom of schizophrenia, says Holofernes. Do you agree with 
Holofernes' diagnosis? Why or why not? Be sure your answer reveals a knowledge of the 
definition of schizophrenia. 
 
 
 
 
24. (10) Longaville suffers from "anorexia nervosa", says Holofernes. His body weight is 
30% lower than the normal weight for a man of his height and age. He eats a highly 
restricted diet and seems intensely worried about becoming fat. Indeed, he claims he is fat 
even though everyone else thinks he looks very skinny. Do you agree with Holofernes' 
diagnosis in this case? Why or why not? Be sure your answer reveals a knowledge of the 
definition of anorexia nervosa. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
25. (10) For the sake of argument, suppose Longaville did suffer from anorexia nervosa. 
How would you treat him if you were his doctor/therapist? Please explain your answer 
don't just give a one word treatment option  (e.g. "Leeches"). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
26. (20) Holofernes believes that the treatment should involve use of his new drug, 
"neuroboost". Here are the claims for what neuroboost will do. If a claim could possibly 
be correct, mark it as OK. Otherwise, please explain why the claim is nonsense. 
 
Claim 1 (5): In a normal synapse in most places in the brain, neurotransmitter is released 
by the dendrites. It crosses the synaptic gap and stimulates (or inhibits) the axon. 
Neuroboost increases synaptic activity by increasing the rate of release of 
neurotransmitter from the dendrites. 
 
Claim 2 (5): Neuroboost improves axonal transmission by stripping off the build-up of 
myelin sheath around the neuron. 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Claim 3 (5): Neuroboost eliminates excess inhibition of motor activity by reversing the 
sign of excess negative action potentials in the Globus Pallidus. That is, if the Globus 
Pallidus has too many negative (inhibitory) action potentials, a dose of Neuroboost will 
make restore the normal balance between action potentials that are positive changes in 
voltage and those that are negative changes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Claim 4 (5): Finally, Neuroboost restores normal appetite by delaminating the lateral 
geniculate nucleus of the thalamus.  
 
 
 
 
 
27. (5) At this point, Constable Dull enters. As you may gather from his name. Dull is not 
the brightest guy. Holofernes whispers to Sir Nathaniel that he has known that Dull was 
dull ever since he saw Dull's SAT (Shakespearean Aptitude Test) score when Dull was a 
child. In fact, Dull comes from a race of people known to be Dull (the Dullards, of 
course). Dullards are just born dull, he says. 
 
How does Holofernes know that the SAT measures dullness? Well, the correlation of 
SAT with grade-point average in school is +0.65. What does this mean? PICK AS 
MANY ANSWERS AS YOU LIKE BUT NO PARTIAL CREDIT. 

 
 
 
a.  65% of those scoring above the mean on the SAT will have GPAs above the mean. 
b.  If you know the SAT score, you can predict the GPA. You won't be perfect but you 
won't be guessing either. 
c.  If you know the GPA, you can predict the SAT score. You won't be perfect but you 
won't be guessing either. 
d.  The trait measured by SAT contributes to school performance. That is, SAT measures 
something that causes GPA, (but not completely . If it were complete, the correlation 
would be 1.0). 
e.  (D) is false because correlation alone cannot tell you about causality. 
f.  All of this is nonsense because correlations below 1.0 are not statistically significant. 
That is the meaning of the correlation coefficient number. 
g.  This sure sounds like question 17, is something tricky happening? 
 
28. (10) About this idea that Dullards are born dull. That might be quite an overstatement 
but there is some evidence for a genetic contribution to something we might want to call 
intelligence. Please give one example of evidence in favor of a genetic contribution to 
intelligence. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
29. (10) On the other hand, there is evidence against the notion that different groups have 
different intelligence (as measured by things like IQ tests) AND that those differences are 
relatively fixed and biologically based. Please give on example of evidence that group 
differences in IQ might not be due to differences in biology. NOTE: Be sure that your 
answer includes evidence not just opinion. 

29. (5) In Act 4, Scene 3, we return to the king and his three friends. They have all been 
sending love letters to the women of their dreams. They all feel guilty about this because 
they promised to be studying (remember, no women). What would Freud say about their 
feelings of guilt? 
 
a)  The superego is punishing the ego for violating the superego's expectations. 
b)  The id produces guilt when its needs are frustrated. 
c)  The unconscious projects guilt into the preconscious. 
d)  The ego uses guilt as a defense against the pressures of the superego. 
e)  The ego uses guilt as a defense against the pressures of the id. 
 
30. (10) Longaville has been having weird dreams. He dreams that his love (Maria) is 
running away from him into a tunnel but that he can't get into the tunnel. He is afraid that 
something or someone bad will get her in there. He goes to see a psychoanalyst to ask 
what the dream was about. He has never gone to this analyst before but he has heard that 
the guy is good at dream interpretation and, indeed, the analyst takes his copy of Freud's 
"Interpretation of Dreams" off the shelf and offers the following account: "The tunnel is a 
clearly sexual image. It also refers to the birth canal. This dream is a common dream in 
individuals who have never resolved their Oedipal desire for the mother. They cannot 
enter the tunnel because of fear of the father." 
 
There is something wrong with this picture of Freudian dream analysis. What problem(s) 
can you find? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
31. (10) For whatever reason, Longaville isn't happy with this account, so he goes to the 
sleep lab at the local hospital. They tell him that modern sleep research proves that 
Freud's ideas about dreams were complete nonsense. Are they right? Please describe two 
bits of information about sleep and dreams that might cast doubt on Freud's theory.  
 
 
 
32. (20) The king and his friends all catch each other with poems (really bad poems) to 
their loves. They are all embarrassed but then they "resolve to woo these girls of France" 
(4,3). What should they do? The first thing they think of is presents. Let's send the 
women some presents. So, what is that all about? The king and his friends are looking for 
love. What are presents going to do for them? There are many explanations about how 
and/or why presents might help in the pursuit of romance. Please give two theories. 
NOTE: These must be two clearly different answers if you want full credit. They must 

also reveal knowledge relevant to this course and not your own personal theory of why 
gifts work. 
 
Theory One 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Theory Two 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
34. (5) The next brilliant idea that the men come up with is to visit the women, disguised 
as Russians. Don't ask why, but they need a story so they say that they are travelling 
through France looking for their mothers who disappeared when they were children. This 
has left them with lifelong problems surround the issue of "attachment" (p575ff).  What 
accounts for an infant's attachment to its primary caregiver (traditionally, the mother). 
Pick as many answers as you like. We might actually give partial credit on this one. 
 
a.  Freud asserted that infants were afraid that they would be unfed without the mother. 
b.  Bowlby asserted fear of the unfamiliar produced attachment. Mom represented 
comfort and security, not food. 
c.  Harlow did research on monkeys that showed that baby monkeys would chose a soft, 
comforting cloth surrogate mommy doll over a cold, hard surrogate mommy that 
produced milk from a bottle. 
d.  Nope, Harlow's monkeys went for the bottle, not the cloth surrogate, supporting 
Freud's view.  
e.  Nope, Freud's view was that the newborn child's attachment to the mother was 
essentially a form of adult sexual possessiveness. 
f.  And Bowlby was actually a Kansas chicken farmer who raised monkeys for Harlow 
on the side. 
g.  all of the above. 
 
35. (20) Well, the Russian escapade ends in great embarrassment for the guys. They are 
quickly discovered and the women tease them mercilessly. If this were a standard 
comedy, the play would end with a big wedding (at least 4-fold, maybe more). However, 
in Love's Labours Lost, a herald comes in to announce the death of the King of France. 
With the death of the princess's father, as Berowne puts it "the scene begins to cloud". 
The ending is very interesting. The men, especially the King of Navarre, have great 

difficulty in switching from lovers to sympathetic friends of a daughter in mourning. 
They still want to get married....now. The women say 'talk to us in a year' and they 
impose strict conditions on the men; conditions like the conditions the men thought they 
were swearing to at the start of the play.  
 
So says Berowne: 
       "Our wooing doth not end like an old play; 
       Jack hath not Jill:  
 
KING: Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day, 
         And then 'twill end. 
 
BEROWNE: That's too long for a play. 
 
And it is too long for a final exam, so to end the exam, think of something you studied 
that you really wish had been on the final. Write a question worth 20 points and write an 
answer in order to get those  20 points. Be sure that this is new material. ANSWER ON 
BACK IF YOU NEED SPACE. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
THANKS, HAPPY HOLIDAYS AND THE BEST FOR THE NEW MILLENIUM
