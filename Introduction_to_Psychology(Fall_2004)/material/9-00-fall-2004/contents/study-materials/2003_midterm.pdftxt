9.00 Introduction to Psychology
Catch a Midterm by the Tale 
16 October 2003 
190 total points 

Many  of  you  will  have  read  Philip  Pullman’s  great  trilogy  “His  Dark  Material”  (“The  Golden  Compass”  is 
volume  1.)  Fewer  of  you  may  know  his  Sally  Lockhart  trilogy.  Frankly,  it  is  not  as  good  but  volume  three, 
“The Tiger  in  the Well”  is  a  fine  tale  and will  do  for  a midterm.  PLEASE NOTE:  I  am  using  the  story  for  its 
story but you don't need  to know anything about  it  in order  to do well on  this exam.  If you  think  that  the story 
is  confusing  you,  please  ask  and we will  explain  the meaning  of  any  question. We  are  not  trying  to  be  tricky. 
Write your answers on the exam. Use the back of pages if needed (Tell us where to look!). Good luck.

1)  (5  pts)  The  novel  opens  with  Sally  in  her  garden  on  a  sunny  morning  in 
London in 1881. Since it is sunny 
a. 
It is probably too bright for Sally’s cone photoreceptors to operate. 
No,  it  is  probably  too  bright  for  Sally’s  rod  photoreceptors  to 
b. 
operate. 
Actually,  in  bright  sunlight  you  get  long  and  mid-wavelength 
sensitive  cones  and  short wavelength  rods operating which permits 
“trichomatic ” vision. 
No,  no…  the  addition  of  rod  function  to  cone  function  permits 
“duplex” or “stereoscopic ” vision. 
All of these are nonsense. 
e. 
f.  Some of these are nonsense, but sadly I do not know which ones. 

d. 

2)  (5) At  the moment,  Sally  is  happy  (It won’t  last.).  If  I were  to  explain  her 
happiness  as  the  product  of  a  particular  pattern  of  neural  activity  in
specific parts of her brain, you might call me a 
a.  dualist 
b.  a Cartesian (as in Descartes) 
c.  a behaviorist 
d.  an introspectionist 
e.  any or all of the above 
f.  none of the above 

TOTAL 

3)  (10)  The  chief  source  of  her  happiness  is  her  daughter.  Harriet  (age  1  yr,  9 
months). She  conceived Harriet  at  the  end  of Book One. She was  not married
to  Fredrick  Garland,  the  father  AND  Garland  died  in  a  fire  immediately 
thereafter.  This  left  Sally  as  the  single mother  of  an  illegitimate  daughter  but, 
at  the  moment,  that  is  not  a  problem.  She  is  happy  because  she  is  convinced 
that  her  child  is  very  clever.  For  example,  she  is  convinced  that  her  “brilliant’  child  could  add  and 
subtract when she was only 6 months old. Is that  ‘brilliant’? Is there any evidence that a 6 month old 
can  add  and  subtract  small  numbers  (say  1+1  or  2-1).  Defend  your  answer  with  experimental 
evidence (How could you do the experiment?). If you have no clue, tell us something about how you 
could  study  the cognitive abilities of a 6-month old and we might give you  some points.  (ANSWER

answer to #3: 

4)  (10)  Harriet  is  in  the  two-word  stage  in  her  linguistic  development.  Sally  is  very  impressed 
because  she  thinks  Harriet’s  ‘brilliant’  two-word  utterances  show  evidence  of  some  grasp  of 
syntax. What  does  this  mean?  (Defining  “syntax ”  would  be  good.)  Is  this  likely  in  a  two-word 
speaker? What kind evidence could Sally present to make her case? 

5)

 (10) A little background, Sally Lockhart is an unusually independent Victorian woman. She runs 
her  own  financial  investment  firm  as  well  as  managing  the  financial  affairs  of  a  photographic 
firm  she  set  up  with  the  deceased  father  of  her  child.  In  her  financial  work,  she  specializes  in 
investing  the  money  of  other  independent  women  like  retired  school  teachers.  She  has  noticed 
something  that  she  thinks  is  odd.  If  she  takes  100  pounds  of  someone’s money  and  turns  it  into 
150 within a year, her clients are very happy. If she takes 1000 pounds and turns it into 1050, the 
clients  are  not  as  happy.  In  both  cases,  the  client  is  50  pounds  richer. What  is  going  on?  Please 
explain  in  some way  that  indicates  your  knowledge  of  the  cognitive  psychology  of  the  value  or 
“utility” money.

6)  (10)  These  are  the  relatively  early  days  of  photography.  People  are  amazed  by  how  real  the 
images  look.  However,  no  flat  photograph  can  ever  look  perfectly  realistic  because  there  are 
depth  cues  that  are  available  in  the  real 3D world but not  in 2D pictures of  the 3D world. Please 
name two such cues and explain why they cannot be obtained from a single 2D photograph. 

7)  (5)  The  firm  of  Garland  and  Lockhart  made  several  series  of  pictures  for  sale.  These  were,  for 
example,  illustrations  of  famous  stories.  Suppose  that  someone  looked  at  the  photographs  but 
could not  identify any objects  in  the scenes. They could point  to  the  locations of objects but  they 
didn’t know what they were, even though everyone else could recognize the objects. That person 
would be called 

a.  A visual agnosic 
d.  Dysphoric 

b. A visual aphasic 
c. A visual anemic 
e. Retrograde amnesic f. could be A or E 

8)  (10)  Do  you  think  that  this  deficit  in  visual  perception  could  be  restricted  to  photographs  (and 
other  2D  representations  like  paintings)?  Could  someone  be  able  to  successfully  identify  visual 
objects  in  the  real  world  while  being  unable  to  identify  visual  objects  in  2D  pictures?  (Assume 
that these pictures were identifiable by other, neurologically intact people.) Please briefly explain 
your answer. Minimal credit for a simple “yes” or “no”.

9)

  (10)  Regardless  of  your  answer  to  the  previous  questions,  where  would  you  look  for  brain 
damage  in  this  person?  Remember,  he  can  see  the  objects,  he  can  point  to  them,  but  he  cannot 
identify them. Please briefly explain your answer. 

10)  (5)  Sally likes to show pictures to Harriet. The first time Harriet sees a new picture, she says “oo 
ah!”.  She  says  the  same  thing  on  the  second  and maybe  the  third  time. After  that,  you  don’t  get 
much response. This  “decline in the tendency to respond to stimuli that have become familiar ”  is 
called 

a.  a recency effect 
d.  negative reinforcement 
f. 
toddler rage 

b. directed forgetting 
e. punishment 

c. habituation 
e. defenestration 

11) (5)  This  pleasant  scene  is  ruined  when  a  courier  appears  and  serves  her  with  court  papers  in 
which  some  man  named  Parrish  seeks  a  divorce  from  her  and  seeks  custody  of  her  child.  Since 
she  has  never  married  and  does  not  know  anyone  named  Parrish,  this  is  first  strange,  then 
annoying,  and  finally  frightening.  If  we  were  looking  for  neural  locus  of  the  anger  and  fear,  a 
good place to look would be 

a.  the amygdala in the limbic system 
b.  the hypothalamus (below the thalamus) 
c.  the hyperthalamus (above the thalamus) 
e. adrenal cortex 
d.  parietal cortex 

f. deep left field 

12) (5)  Sally  goes  into  town  to  see  her  new  lawyer  (Her  old  one  has  died).  It  is  not  a  pleasant 
experience.  Every  time  Sally  mentions  Harriet’s  name,  the  lawyer  gives  a  little  cough  of 
disapproval.  Eventually,  Sally  stops  mentioning  the  name  at  all.  Why?  (The  relevant  technical 
terms are underlined for your viewing pleasure – Feel free to briefly explain your answer.) 

a.  The naming behavior has been extinguished due by sensory preconditioning. 
b.  The naming behavior has been suppressed by punishment. 
c.  The naming behavior has been overshadowed by the lawyer’s behavior. 
d.  The naming behavior has been extinguished by negative reinforcement. 
e.  Actually, all of the above could be true. 
f.  None of the above.

13)   (10)  In  an  effort  to  be  nice,  the  lawyer  gives  Sally  a  candy with  a  flavor  that  she  has  never  had 
before.  In  their  conversation,  he  chooses  to  behave  as  though  she  really  has  been  married  to 
Parrish  and  has  been  lying  about  it.  After  an  unsatisfying  hour,  she  leaves  his  office  feeling 
nauseated.  She  makes  it  to  the  lavatory  and,  sadly,  becomes  sick  to  her  stomach.  OK,  let  us 
review. Sally has been exposed once to a new lawyer and a new flavor. She has then become sick 
to  her  stomach. As  a  result  of  the  nausea  she  could  develop  an  aversion  to  the  taste,  the  lawyer, 
both,  or  neither.  What  do  you  think  will  happen?  Please  explain  in  a  manner  that  reveals 
knowledge that might have been obtained from the chapter or lectures on Learning (p150ff). 

14) (10)  If  the  lawyer  is  going  to  be  an  idiot,  she  had  better  help  herself.  She  goes  to  Portsmouth  to 
check  the  records  in  the  church  where  she  is  supposed  to  have  been  married.  They  will  have 
records  if  there was a marriage. She gets  to Portsmouth  late at night and must stay at an Inn. She 
fills  in  the  registration  form. On  the  front, she must say  if she  is married or not. On  the back  is a 
place  to  say  if  she  wants  a  double  bed.  She  puts  the  card  on  the  desk  with  three  others.  Here  is 
what you can see. 

I am 
unmarried 

I am 
married 

Double 
bed 
please 

Single 
bed 
please 

The innkeeper comes in and says.  “The rule of this house is  If you are single, you must sleep in 
a single bed. ” Being a very  lazy  innkeeper, he wants  to  turn over  the minimum number of cards 
to  check  if  his  rule  is  being  obeyed.  “Wow”,  says  Sally  to  herself,  “this  is  just  like  the  selection 
task  described  on  pp300-301  of  Gleitman  and  in  the  lecture.  I  wonder  if  he  can  figure  out  the 
minimum number of cards to turn over.” 

What  do  you  think?  Please  answer  in  a  way  that  makes  it  clear  that  you  know  1)  Why  these 
selection tasks are interesting and 2) what might make a particular version easy or hard.

Answer to #14 

15) (5) After  a  troubled  night’s  sleep  (in  a  single  bed),  Sally  goes  to  the  church. The  church warden 
offers  to  help  find  the  record  and  asks  for  the  name  of  the  husband.  When  she  tells  him  it  is 
“Parrish”. He  says  “
“Parr –  ish”  ,  That  is  two morphemes.  So,  he  says,  he will  look  in  the “Two 
Morpheme” section. Ignoring whether this is a sensible filing system, is he technically correct? 

a.  Close  enough.  Two  syllables  is  pretty  close  to  two  significant  units  of  speech  sound 
which would be two morphemes. 
b.  No,  this  is  lame  because  “morphemes”  refer  to  significantly  distinct  “types ” 
categorization. 
c.  No,  this  is  stupid  because  morphemes  are  hypothetical  building  blocks  of  object  shape 
(hence  “morphing” two shapes). 
d.  No,  this  is  wrong  because  morphemes  are  smallest  significant  units  of  meaning  in 
language (and “ish” is not adding meaning to “Parr” here as it might in “fool-ish”). 
e.  No,  this  is  idiotic  because  morphemes  are  receptors  for  endogenous  opiates  in  the  brain 
(also stimulated by “morphine ”, an exogenous opiate) 
f.  Nah, it just isn’t a word. Can’t have more pheme, only less pheme. 

in 

16) (5) When Sally  gets  to  the  church  the marriage  record  is  really  there.  It  is  in  the  correct  place  in 
the chronological record. It cannot have been added later. Now, for the first time, Sally is shaken. 
Given  this  concrete  evidence  in  front  of  her,  she wonders  if  her memory  is  defective.  If  she  has 
forgotten a marriage that took place several years ago, this would be called. 

b. implicit memory 
a.  retrograde amnesia 
e.  anterograde amnesia  f. spousal agnosia 

c. implicit amnesia 
g. diphtheria 

d. mnemonic 

17) (20) Sally  feels  sure  that  she  has  never  been married  to  anyone  named Parrish  and  she  is  certain 
that the deceased Fred Garland is Harriet’s father. But, at the same time, she realizes that memory 
is  fallible.  Please  describe  four  different  experimental  situations  in  which  something  that  was 
remembered  at  one  time  might  not  be  remembered  later.  Be  sure  that  these  are  all  different 
memory phenomena and  that all are described  in enough detail  to be  recognized as coming  from 
the text or lectures. The examples DO NOT need to be relevant to Sally Lockhart’s situation (but 
that would be very clever). (ANSWER ON NEXT PAGE)

answer to #19 

18)   (10)  Meantime,  back  at  the  house,  the  servants  are  becoming  concerned  about  the  new  man  who 
sharpens  the  knives. For  one  thing,  they  think  he  drinks Sally’s  sherry when  he  comes  to  the  house. 
They  are  right. He  had  been  taking  a  little  swig  from  the  bottle  each  time  he  came  over. He  always 
drinks  one  ounce.  The  first  month,  the  bottle  held  50  oz  and  one  ounce  was  less  than  a  just 
noticeable difference. When he did not get caught, he figured that he could always have a one ounce 
nip and he would be safe. This month, however,  the cook and  the nurse caught him and accused him 
of violating Weber’s Law.  What did  they mean? Why did he get caught? Your answer should make 
it  clear  that  you  know what Weber’s  law  is  and why  it might  be  relevant  here.  If  you  have  no  idea, 
you  could  try Fechner’s Law or write  a good  story with  content  from  the  course  and pray  for partial 
credit.

19)   (5)  The  nurse  and  the  cook  also  think  that  the  knife  man  has  been  spying  on  the  household  by 
listening  to  their conversations. To scare him off,  they put a drug  in  the sherry  that has  the effect 
of making his basilar membranes as stiff as a board  for 24 hours. What would  this do  the knife 
man? 

a.	
b.	

It would make it difficult for him to form speech sounds normally. 
It  would  lead  to  visual  problems  because  the  basilar  membranes  support  the 
photoreceptors, both mechanically and by supplying nutrients. 
c.	
It would disrupt vision because it would distort the optics of the eye. 
d.	 This is silly, The basilar membrane disappears during development, usually before birth. 
It would disrupt hearing  if  the membrane could not vibrate  in response  to vibration of  the 
e.	
fluid in the cochlea. 
f.	 The knife man would be very happy. Stiff as a board is just the way you want your basilar 
membrane. 

20) (5) Meantime, the nurse is worried about the cook. The cook is getting really plump. It is as if she 
no longer knows when to stop eating. The nurse has several theories about what is wrong. Which 
do you think is plausible? Which of these signals are related to the act of not eating? (94ff) 

a.	 The  stomach  should  be  sending  signals  to  the  brain  when  it  is  loaded  with  a  nutritious 
substance. Maybe this is not happening. 
b.	 Hormones  coming  from  the  duodenum,  the  first  part  of  the  small  intestine  send  “stop 
eating messages” to the brain. Maybe that is broken. 
c.	 The  nurse’s  fat  cells  should  be  releasing  leptin  so  that  the  hypothalamus  can  figure  out 
that her body has enough fat. Maybe her leptin receptors aren’t working. 
d.	 Maybe she has a lesion in a part of the hypothalamus. Lesions in the correct bit can make 
a rat eat until it looks like a furry football. 
e.	 A &  D 
f. B & D 
g. A &  C 
f.	 None of the above 

h. A, B, C, & D 

21) (10) The nurse and  the cook get  into an argument about all of  this. The cook  insists  that  she eats 
because she likes to. The nurse insists that the cook is a slave to pleasure centers in her brain. She 
is  just  eating  to  produce  more  activity  in  little  bits  of  brain  tissue.  Leaving  aside  the  issue  of 
“Free  Will”,  is  there  any  real  evidence  for  “pleasure  centers”  (or  at  least  specific  loci  of 
reinforcement) in the brain? Please explain briefly.

22) (10) Sally comes back from Portsmouth on the train. It is a bumpy ride. When her car goes over a 
bump, the car lurches and Sally reflexively winces. She is in the second car. The first car hits the 
bump  before  the  second  car  (amazingly  enough).  This  makes  a  noise  (“clunk”)  about  a  second 
before  Sally’s  car  hits  the  bump.  After  a  few  minutes  of  clunk  ->  bump,  clunk  ->  bump.  Sally 
winces  in  response  to  the  clunk.  That  sounds  like  either  Classical  (Pavlovian)  or  Operant 
(Instrumental) Conditioning.  I  can’t  remember. Can  you  clarify? Be  sure  to  use  at  least  some  of 
the following terms (the appropriate ones!): 

Positive reinforcer, negative reinforcer, unconditioned stimulus, conditioned stimulus, unconditioned 
response, conditioned response, insight, preparedness. 

23) (10)  A  little  kid  on  the  train  realizes  that  if  he makes  a  “clunk”    noise,  Sally  will make  a  funny 
face. Once  the  kid  starts  “clunking”, Sally  realizes  this,  too,  and  decides  she  needs  to  extinguish 
the behavior. How can she get  rid of  this unfortunate habit. A  really good answer will describe a 
method for curing the habit while she is still on the train. 

OK…I am sure that will do….even if I didn’t get far into the story.
