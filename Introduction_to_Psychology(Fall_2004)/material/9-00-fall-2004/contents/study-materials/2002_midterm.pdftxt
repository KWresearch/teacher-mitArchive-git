If  you  think  animated  feature  films  begin  and  end  with  Disney,  you  should  see  some  of  the  work  of  Hayao 
Miyazaki.  He  has  produced  a  series  of  entertaining  and  evocative  movies.  The  latest  is  entitled  “Spirited 
Away”    and  I decided  to use  it  as  the basis  for  the midterm. PLEASE NOTE:  I  am using  the  film  for  its  story 
but  you  don't  need  to  know  anything  about  it  in  order  to  do  well  on  this  exam.  If  you  think  that  the  story  is 
confusing  you,  please  ask  and  we  will  explain  the  meaning  of  any  question.  We  are  not  trying  to  be  tricky. 
Write your answers on the exam. Use the back of pages if needed (Tell us where to look!). Good luck.

NOTE: Even though this is fantasy with spirits, witches, etc., assume that the 
rules for our universe apply unless you are told otherwise. Same brains. Same 
mental process. Etc.  
 
1)  (10  points)  At  the  beginning  of  the  movie,  a  10-yr  old  girl,  Chihiro,  is  in  the 
back seat of the family car. She is sulking because they are moving to a new house 
and  she didn’t want  to go. She  is  staring out  the  left window as  they drive  through 
a  town. This means  that  all  the buildings  appear  to be moving  from  right  to  left as 
the  car  moves  forward.  When  the  car  stops,  she  shifts  her  gaze  to  look  at  the 
buildings out of the right-side window.  
 
Do the buildings appear to move or not? Why? What does this tell us about vision 
– specifically, about the processing of motion? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2) (5)  Her dad (being a dad) decides to take a short-cut. Soon they are racing down 
a dirt  road  into denser and denser  forest. The car keeps hitting bumps. These  scare 
the  girl. When  car  hits  a  bump,  she  squeals.  This  is  reflexive.  That  is  simply  they 
way she sounds when she is scared. 
 
If we are thinking in the language of learning theory, the physical sensation of the bumps would be 
called. 
 

a)  the distal stimulus          b) the operant condition      c) the unconditioned stimulus 
d)  the conditioned stimulus       e) negative reinforcement          f) the pits

3) (5)  And the squeals would be called 
 

a)  the distal response 
b)  the proximal stimulus 
c)  the conditioned response 
d)  the unconditioned response 
e)  operant reinforcement 
f)  popular music 

 
4) (10) Along the side of the road are weird little statues. Sometimes they appear just before a bump so 
you have the sequence: Statue (cid:198) Bump (cid:198) squeal. Sometimes the statues appear where there is no bump 
and sometimes a bump is hit with no statue in sight. It happens that there have been statues before most 
bumps. However,  there is no contingent relationship between statues and bumps. At the end of the road, 
there is a statue but no bump. Will Chihiro squeal? Please explain your answer. A good answer will use 
the appropriate terminology from whatever form of learning this might be. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5) (5) Oh yes, the end of the road. The short cut ends abruptly in front a building with narrow tunnel 
leading through it. The dad decides to explore. Chihiro thinks that this is A Bad Idea but dads never 
listen so they walk into the tunnel. It is dim in the tunnel. Chihiro notices that her colorful clothes now 
appear to be only shades of gray. Why? 
 

a)  Chihiro’s cone photoreceptors do not work in dim (scotopic) light levels. 
b)  Chihiro’s rod photoreceptors are subject to the problem of “univariance” which makes it 
impossible to tell one wavelength from another except by perceived brightness. 
c)  Chihiro has only one type of rod photoreceptor.  
d)  The visual system is not trichromatic at scotopic light levels. 
e)  All of the above 
f)  A & D  
g) A & C 
i)  none of the above 
 
6) (5) Eventually, they emerge into what looks like an abandoned waiting room. It is much brighter here 
(color vision is back) The windows are tinted. The sun, shining through the windows puts spots of light 
on the white wall. Conveniently, these are monochromatic (single wavelength) patches of light. One 
patch is a lovely 470 nanometers (nm). It looks blue. Another is 570 nm. It looks yellow. These two 
patches partially overlap. The mixture of 470 nm and 570 nm light, shining on a white wall will appear 
to be what color?_________________________ 

h) There is lots of dust in here.

7) (5) If dad was carrying a spectrophotometer, he could measure the physical wavelength(s) reflected 
from the wall. He would find that the wavelength composition of the mixture of 470 nm and 570 nm 
light was  
               ________________________ (feel free to add a brief explanation if you like). 
 
 
 
 
 
8) (10) Suppose the Chihiro stares at the pattern on the wall for a while and suppose it looks like this: 
  
 
 
She fixates on the “a” for 30 seconds and 
then shifts her gaze to “b”. What does she 
see and why? (You can draw on the figure 
if you like but don’t forget the WHY part).

9) (5) Beyond the waiting room is a green field and across the field is what appears to be an abandoned 
town….except that there is a really good smell. This makes Chirhiro’s parents curious and hungry. If 
you were looking for the brain areas involved in this feeling of hunger, you might look in  
a)  the hypothalamus 
b)  the hippocampus 
c)  the adrenal cortex 
d)  the third ventrical 
e)  any of these could be correct because it is not possible to localize brain areas for hunger. 
f)  none of the above 

 
10) (10) There are a lot of closed stores but, eventually, they find a food stall with a really great looking 
buffet. The parents try to get someone to take their order but no one appears, so they decide to just dig in 
and eat. Chihiro thinks that this is A Really Bad Idea but parents never listen. Chihiro wanders around. 
She finds a bridge leading across to a beautiful-looking building but on that bridge, she meets a boy 
named Haku who tells her to get out before it is too late. In fact, she is in big trouble (She doesn’t know

MIDTERM 2002 

YOUR NAME _______________________ 

it yet.) Haku doesn’t know her, of course, but he wants to help her. Why? There is no one right answer 
to this. Just be sure your answer says something about the psychology of motivation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11) (5) Here is the trouble. While Chihiro has been sulking, the parents pig out. They really pig out. 
When Chihiro comes back, they have turned into real pigs. This is A Really Big Problem. Mom and Dad 
now have pig brains. In which of these would you expect to find the biggest difference between a pig 
brain and a human brain? 
 

a)  Limbic system structures (e.g. hippocampus and amygdala). 
b)  Brain stem structures 
c)  Neurotransmitters 
d)  Myelin 
e)  Frontal cortex 
f)  The porcine nucleus  

 
12) (10) Naturally enough, Chihiro is really scared. She goes running around yelling for help. There are 
all sorts of changes going in her nervous system in order to mobilize her body for this “fight” or “flight” 
challenge. We are interested in just one aspect of nervous system function. What happens to the size of 
the action potentials traveling down her axons? Please explain briefly. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
13) (5) Things get worse. She sees people but they turn out to be spirits. She runs back to find Haku and 
he tells her that she is trapped. This building is a giant Japanese bathhouse for spirits. It is run by a witch 
named Yubaba. If she wants to get her parents turned back into humans, Chihiro has to find Yubaba and 
get Yubaba to give her a job. It takes a while but she finds Yubaba. Yubaba makes her forget her name. 
This would be a form of

YOUR NAME _______________________ 

a)  anterograde amnesia 
b)  retrograde amnesia 
c)  prosopagnosia 
d)  agraphia 
e)  a & c 
f)  b & c 
g)  b & d 

 
 
14) (10) When Chihiro realizes that she cannot remember her name, she concludes that she has had 
bilateral damage to her hippocampus (bilateral = in both hemispheres). Is she correct? Please explain 
using specific evidence that shows you know something about bilateral hippocampal damage. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15) (15)  Yubaba says that Chirhiro’s new name is “Sen”. She tells Sen that there is nothing wrong with 
her memory. To prove this, she gives Sen a list of 14 nonsense syllables to remember. Sen successfully 
remembers 7 of these. Specifically, she can recall syllable numbers 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, & 13. Though this 
certainly could happen, it is not typical. Please describe the typical results, explain why those results 
occur, and make up a story BASED ON MATERIAL FROM THE COURSE to explain Sen’s 
performance. 
 

a)  What are the typical results? 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 

b)  What is the explanation of those results? 
 
 
 
 
c)  Give an explanation of Sen’s results:

MIDTERM 2002 

YOUR NAME _______________________ 

b) morphemes       c) concrete operations        d) syntax         e) etiquette 

16) (10) Sen still says she wants a job. At that moment a huge pillow comes flying from the next room. 
“Go take care of the baby,” says Yubaba. Sen looks in the next room and sees the world’s biggest baby. 
“How old is that baby” asks Sen. “Guess” says Yubaba. Sen sees that the baby is fussing because he 
wants a rattle that he can see. She hides the rattle. The baby stops fussing. In fact, the baby behaves as if 
the rattle no longer exists. “Ah” says Sen, “Piaget would say that this baby lacks ____________ and 
must be in the ____________ stage. That would make the baby about _____________ old. 
 
POSSIBLE ANSWERS include: oral, concrete operations, sensory-motor, syntactic, syntax, object 
permanence, unconscious inference, subjectivity, objectivity, family values, thalamo-cortical, pre-
operational, Gestalt…. 
 
You may fill in the blanks with these terms or any others that you can think of. 
 
17) (5) Then the baby says “I slorged a frambus with a gormly toop.” Sen says ”I can’t really understand 
the meaning of what that baby is saying but he sure has a good grasp of  
 
a) semantics 
 
18) (5) Is it plausible that the same baby/child would produce the behaviors in questions 16 and 17 at the 
same age? Please explain briefly. 
 
 
 
 
 
19) (15) Sen still says she wants a job. Finally, Yubaba agrees. She tells Sen to go to the supervisor to 
get a job scrubbing the baths (This is a bathhouse, remember?). Yubaba tells her that her behavior must 
be shaped so that she can work on a variable ratio schedule of reinforcement with a high ratio of 
scrubbing to reinforcement. She says once she is trained in this way, the scrubbing behavior will not 
extinguish rapidly. Make up a story about Sen’s training and her job that makes it clear that you 
understand the terms shaped (or shaping), variable ratio schedule of reinforcement,  and 
extinguish(or extinction). If you don’t feel like writing stories, just define the terms – that will be fine.

19) (10) Sen gets sent to the biggest bath. When you have a bath customer, you can get special herbs and 
spices to for their bath. Sen’s trainer warns her to be careful. For example, there is one mixture that can 
knock out the entire right hemisphere of the brain. The effect is reversible but inconvenient. What would 
inactivation of the right hemisphere of a typical right-handed individual do to voluntary control of 
skeletal muscles (like those you would use to move your arms and legs). Feel free to offer a bit of 
explanation. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
20) (10) What would inactivation of the right hemisphere of a typical right-handed individual do to 
vision. Please explain your answer (maybe draw a picture?) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
21) (5) In a typical right-handed individual, inactivation of the right hemisphere would 
 

a)  produce Broca’s aphasia 
b)  produce Wernicke’s aphasia 
c)  both of the above 
d)  none of the above 
e)  c & d 

 
 
22) (10) Running a bath turns out to be an exercise in problem solving. There are all sorts of rules to 
keep in mind. If the spirit is a sludge monster, then it is to be avoided. But if the sludge monster is really 
a river spirit with a pollution problem, then it can be helped….and so on. As you know, people are not 
good at working these problems out in terms of formal logic (If p, then q…etc). They use short-cuts 
known as heuristics. Please described two of the heuristics used in human problem solving. You could 
describe the availability or representativeness heuristics. You could describe framing or the base rate 
problem. If none of that makes sense, try something else. You do not need to use the bathhouse as an 
example (but that would be clever).  ANSWER ON NEXT PAGE

23) (10) In fact, a sludge monster does show up and he is assigned to Sen. Everyone else gathers to 
watch because this is a very rare and salient event. It is the sort of event that might produce a flashbulb 
memory. The others in the bathhouse talked about the sludge monster for a long time. A year later, you 
might still hear someone say “I remember exactly where I was when I first saw that thing.”  How much 
faith would you put in the details of this memory report? Please defend your answer with TWO pieces 
of empirical evidence about recall from memory. In addition to flashbulb memory, experiments dealing 
with eye witness testimony and/or forgetting might be relevant. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Oh dear…I didn’t tell you about No-Face or the Witch’s sister or the little things that carry the coal. You 
will just have to see the movie but this will do for now.
