Jeopardy Questions 

Intelligence 
$100: (Answer is a number) This correlation would indicate a perfect relationship 
between x and y such that as x increases, y decreases.  [-1.0] 
$200: Both of these two types of intelligence change with age, peaking at different times 
of the life cycle. [fluid and crystallized (fluid deteriorates as you get older, crystallized 
does not)] 
$300: This pattern refers to the steady increase in scores on intelligence tests within the 
last few decades. [Flynn effect] 
$400: This type of approach to intelligence begins with test scores themselves, and is 
based on the belief that the patterns within those scores are the best guide to what 
intelligence is and what it includes. [the psychometric approach (other approaches 
include the information-processing approach)] 
$500: This simple low-level cognitive property is believed by many to underlie many 
measures of g.  [reaction time (accept either simple or choice), or neural efficiency/speed] 

Personality 
$100: Personality tests are low in this, since they aren’t very good at predicting outcomes 
or behaviors that should be correlated with the trait being measured. [validity or 
predictive validity (compare to reliability)] 
$200: This type of test presents the subject with an unstructured task rather than a set of 
questions, on the assumption that the deeper layers of one’s personality are not accessible 
by asking directly. [projective test (e.g. Rorschach, TAT)] 
$400: According to this, people will strive for higher-order needs generally after lower-
order needs like hunger and safety have been satisfied.  [Maslow / Maslow’s hierarchy of 
needs] 
$200: This movement in psychology attempts to address questions about what defines 
and engenders optimal functioning, rather than investigating pathology and deficiency. 
[positive psychology] 
$500: Cattell isolated this many basic personality factors by doing factor analysis on 
18,000 words for personality types in the dictionary. [16 (later collapsed to 5 and then 2 
by Eysenck)] 

Psychopathology 
$100: This type of disease, characterized by intense and irrational fear, can often be 
treated through flooding. [phobias; or panic attacks] 
$200: One hypothesis suggests that the main cause of schizophrenia is an abnormally 
high level of activity in brain circuits sensitive to this neurotransmitter. [dopamine] 
$300: This illness caused the disorder known as general paresis, which was characterized 
by general decline in physical functions resulting in eventual insanity and death. 
[syphilis] 
$400: According to this model, mental disorders are manifestations of psychological 
conflicts originating from our childhood experiences. [psychodynamic] 

$500: A person with a global, internal, and stable type of this is much more likely to end 
up depressed than a person without.  [explanatory style (talk about cause and effect here)] 

Social behavior 
$100: This effect occurs when people fail to help someone who is in trouble and whom 
they are capable of helping, such as in the case of Kitty Genovese.   [the bystander effect 
(talk about factors: ambiguity of situation, diffusion of responsibility, pluralistic 
ignorance)] 
$200: This mistake refers to a tendency to ascribe people's behavior to their nature 
instead of to the situation.  [fundamental attribution error (also discuss actor-observer 
difference)] 
$300: Milgram's experiment supported the idea that these kinds of personalities may be 
the crucial determinant leading to blind obedience.  [authoritarian personalities (alternate 
interpretation: dehumanization of the victim.  Also discuss Asch's study on conformity, 
and how unaninmity can be a key component there)] 
$400: According to this theory, emotion results from the awareness of physical changes 
in one's body in response to arousing stimuli.  [the James-Lange theory of emotions 
(compare to the attribution-of-arousal theory, which argues that bodily arousal is only the 
beginning and must be accompanied by a cognitive appraisal of the situation that 
attributes the arousal to an emotional event)] 
$500: The success of the foot-in-the-door technique can be seen as the result of people 
trying to avoid this phenomenon. [cognitive dissonance (talk about changing self-
perception in order to resolve conflict between what we believe and what we actually 
do)] 

Social development 
$100: This phenomenon, found in birds, illustrates the biological tendency found in many 
infants to seek that which is familiar. [imprinting (discuss reasons for infant-mother 
attachment -- not for food, but for comfort; survival value of fearing unknown)] 
$200: Psychologists use a child's reaction to this procedure to try to assess the quality of 
the child's attachment to their caregiver [Strange Situation (discuss details of leaving 
toddler alone with stranger, then having parent return; "securely attached"; 
"anxious/resistant"; "anxious/avoidant".  Are these really predictive of later adjustment & 
relationships?)] 
$300: Choosing a punishment that fits this guideline makes a child more likely to 
internalize prohibitions.  [the principle of minimal sufficiency (just enough, but not too 
severe)] 
$400: This parenting style describes parents who both exercise their power to set firm 
rules for their children, and also respond to their children's opinions and reasonable 
demands. [authoritative-reciprocal pattern (compare to autocratic, permissive; not 
necessarily cross-culturally applicable)] 
$500: According to Kohlberg, this stage of moral reasoning defines right and wrong in 
terms of a "social contract" generally agreed upon for public good. [Level 5; or 
postconventional morality (stages: (1) avoid punishment, (2) gain reward, (3) gain 
approval/avoid disapproval, (4) follow rigid codes of "law and order" unquestioningly, 
(5) follow a "social contract", and (6) follow abstract personal ethical principles)] 

Freud 
$100: According to Freud, this subsystem of the personality strives to follow the pleasure 
principle. [id (ego & reality principle; superego)] 
$200: Freud thought that the symptoms of this psychogenic mental disorder were a means 
of repressing thoughts and wishes. [hysteria (psychoanalysis was directed toward 
recovering the repressed material to eliminate symptoms)] 
$300: According to Freud, children pass through these three stages in this chronological 
order during their psychosexual development. [oral, anal, phallic (characterized by 
erogenous zones through which gratification is obtained -- food, potty training, sex.  Get 
messed up along the way and you end up with an oral fixation or an anal personality.)] 
$400: In Freud's view, having penis envy is the beginning of girls developing this 
fixation.  [Electra complex (Oedipus complex -- seeks mother as sexual object and wants 
to kill rival, father.  Electra -- regards mother as unworthy, focuses on father to give her a 
child as a "penis substitute")] 
$500: According to Freud, a boy who wants to kick his sister may smother her with love 
instead, after using this defense mechanism to rechannel the forbidden impulse. [reaction 
formation (other defense mechanisms: displacement, rationalization, projection)]
