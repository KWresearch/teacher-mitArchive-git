Lecture 5 - Attention 

The abstract: In this lecture, I will introduce the problem of limited capacity and present 
selective attention as a solution. My favorite tool for studying selective attention is visual 
search, so you will hear a lot about visual search experiments. These experiments lead us 
to the conclusion that we are only recognizing one item in the world at a time. This leads 
to some curious problems. After all, it looks like you are seeing quite a few objects. The 
end of the lecture will point toward some solutions. 

The truth-in-advertising disclaimer: Visual selective attention is the topic of my research 
so some of the ideas in today's lecture may not quite be ready for the textbooks yet. They 
are this week's Truth According to Me. 

We can frame the topic by a series of questions: 

Question 1: What is the problem that attention is solving? 

We can't process everything fully.


Some auditory examples


Some visual examples


Question 2: What escapes the bottleneck of attention? 

Basic features "pop-out" 

Question 3: How can we study this? 

Visual search methods 

Reaction time (RT), set size, 
slope of RT x set size functions a a measure of search efficiency 

Anne Treisman and Feature Integration Theory 

Question 4: How do we find real objects that are not defined by a single feature? 

Conjunction search 

Guided Search 

Bottom-up guidance 

Top-down guidance 

Question 5: Is attention guided to features or objects 

Before attention arrives you have bundles of features attached to a proto-object 

Attention is required to bind features to objects 
(What is binding? & the binding problem) 

Question 6: Is attentional binding like glue? Do the objects stay bound? 

What can you learn from dancing chickens? (and a few other cool demos) 

Change blindness - Why don't you "see" what happens right in front of your eyes? 

Some conclusions 

1)  You only recognize one (or maybe a few) objects at a time

2)  You can store maybe 4 objects in a Visual Short Term Memory (VSTM)

3)  You know something (maybe quite a lot) but maybe you only see the 

current object of attention. 

Question 7: Does this mean that perception is a "grand illusion"? 

My answer to that question changes as we sift the data. September's answer isâ€¦. 

Something to write about, #5:Guiding Features 

I have spent a lot of time on the question of what visual features can guide 
attention. So. if you are looking for a friend in the crowd, it helps to know that she 
is wear a red coat because color guides attention. My latest effort to summarize 
the literature on this topic is 

Wolfe, J. M., & Horowitz, T. S. (2004). What attributes guide the deployment of visual 
attention and how do they do it? Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 5(6), 495-501. 

It is on the website in the #5 GUIDING FEATURES folder. 

If you want to write on this topic, pick one candidate feature and discuss the 
evidence that it is or is not able to guide attention. (I can provide more things to 
read if you send me an email.) 

THE CHALLENGE: Even better. Read the review. Think up a new, hitherto 
unsuspected feature. Use your computer graphics talents to create some sample 
stimuli. Write up a proposed experiment. If you take this option, send me a copy 
of your paper (Don't forget to give it to your TA, too!). If it seems really promising 
and clever, maybe we can do an experiment together.
