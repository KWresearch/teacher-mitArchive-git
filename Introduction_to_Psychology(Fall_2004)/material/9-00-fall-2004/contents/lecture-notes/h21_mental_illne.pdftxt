#21 mental illness: Part Two 

Dec 2, 2004 

Lecture 20: The nature and treatment of mental illness 
The Abstract: Today I want to talk about some of the causes of mental illness and some 
of the ways that we might treat mental illness. First, we will continue with schizophrenia 
and discuss its probable genetic roots. Then we will switch to depression and to the 
question of treatment. What do anti-depressants do? How well do they work? What, if 
any, is the role for psychotherapy? We will also consider obsessive-compulsive disorder 
because it is a case where we can see how treating the mind can cure the brain and vice 
versa. 
Lecture Notes 
What are the causes of mental illness? Back to schizophrenia 

Is there evidence for a genetic component? 

Concordance rates in twins (remember IQ?) 

MZ twins ... concordance about  50% 
DZ twins ...  concordance about  15% 
DZ who think they are MZ 
<  50% 

Is there evidence for environmental contributions? 

The mind like the body can be "sick" or abnormal in a number of ways. 

Example 4: Depression 
Three invented patients


Sarah has had a bad day and she is depressed. She bombed an exam. Her boyfriend just

announced that he is leaving her because he is in love with her best friend, and it is

raining.


Should we give her medication?

Sam is depressed. There is no particular reason for this. It just happens to Sam. He 

oscillates between manic days when he is so up that it hard to concentrate on anything

and depressed days when he is, well, depressed. Lately, these cycles of mania and

depression have been getting faster.


Should we give him medication?

Dec 2, 2004 

Emma is not particularly depressed. She is what we would call dysphoric (opposite of 
euphoric). She just doesn't seem to be able to enjoy herself. Things are just kind of flat. 
This isn't new. This is pretty much the way she has always been. 

VOTE: If we assume that it would change matters, should we give her medication?

What are the important differences between these cases? 

Depression is not one thing and that is certainly true. 

Unipolar vs bipolar 

If time (maybe) typical vs atypical depression 

Do anti-depressants work? 

Maybe 

Why don't they work right away?  Here is one interesting thought 

Jacobs, B. L., Praag, H., & Gage, F. H. (2000). Adult brain neurogenesis and psychiatry: 
a novel theory of depression. Mol Psychiatry, 5(3), 262-269. 

Drugs are slow because they promote neurogenesis….ma 

Does psychotherapy work? 

Maybe 

The mind is what the brain does: A specific example 
Baxter, Lewis R. (1992) Caudate glucose metabolic rate changes with both drug and 
behavior therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Archives of General Psychiatry 
49(9) 681-689 

Example 5 – Obsessive-compulsive  disorder 

Does Prozac work? 

Does behavior therapy work? 

What happens when drugs make us better than we ever were?
