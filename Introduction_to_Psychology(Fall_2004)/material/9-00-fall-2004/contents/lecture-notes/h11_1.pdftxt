From the last handout: Recall that all kids learn language in about the same way. 
Stages: 
I. Pre-linguistics (googoo etc)
Try out the phonemes

Learning word boundaries 
II. One-word stage (12-18 mo)
Try out morphemes

one word stands for a whole idea 
III. Two-word (telegraphic speech) (2 yrs)
Try out elementary syntax

e.g. Word order starts to count
IV. 	 More than two words

Enter "closed class" words – what are they?

And what are they for? 

What is the child learning as he/she learns language? 
The “East Coast”view - Instances and rules. 
Marcus, G. F. (1996). "Why Do Children Say "Breaked"?" Current Directions

in Psychological Science 5(3): 81-85.

How do you make the past tense in English? 

Around age 3 you start to get overgeneralization errors. (What are they?)

The “West Coast” view – Instances in a powerful network 
Seidenberg, M. S., 275, 1599-1604 (1997). Language acquisition and use:
Learning and applying probabilistic constraints. Science, 275, 1599-1604. 

Why is this important? 

Let’s go back to naive nativist and naive empiricist theories. 
Radical nativist: Language is hard-wired and emerges, like a molar, when it is ready. 
No one believes it (except those naively nativist children) 
Counter-example: Japanese kids learn Japanese, etc.
And a Japanese kid raised in an Egyptian family will learn Arabic

Less naive version: There is a primal, innate language, our languages are variants. 
Herodotus and the exp of King Psammetichus of Egypt, 2500 years ago. 
Wolf children, etc (not Wolfe!) 
What is a critical period in development? 
The Radical empiricist view
St. Augustine (4th cent 
The Behaviorist account 
Remember Thorndike's Law of Effect? 

Remember shaping

Skinner's: Verbal Behavior

The great counter argument is in 
Chomsky, N. (1959). A review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior. Language, 35, 26-58. 
and all of this is discussed very well in
Pinker, S. (1994). The Language Instinct. New York: William Morrow and Co. 
What is wrong with the Behaviorist account 
One example: Patterns of reinforcement 
There is A LOT to learn in language learning 
Grammar: an innate property or something that emerges from a network? 
Word meaning: Children learn 5-10 new words every day from 15 months to 6 years. 
Part Two: What  linguistic  abilities  do  animals  have? 
They have SIGNALS 
What does that mean? Animals can communicate 
Let’s distinguish between natural animal communication
And 
Efforts to teach human communication to animals 
What happens if you try to teach a chimp to speak? Hayes (1933) 
What happens if you try to teach a chimp to sign?
ASL= American Sign Language

Animal signals have MEANING 
A unit of meaning in human lang is a morpheme 
Meaning in natural animal language. 
What about trained (human) animal language?
Do chimps have morphemes or words? 
The famous apes (Wahsoe, Koko, et al) 

Irene Pepperberg's parrot, "Alex"

Problems with the data

But let’s give them morphemes

Do animals have GRAMMAR (Syntax) 
Consider: "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" 
Data: Koko may mean one thing by "tickle me" and
another by "me tickle". (not perfect but not random) 
Two types of problems with the data

Interpretation


2004: The newest evidence 
Fitch, W. T., & Hauser, M. D. (2004). Computational constraints on syntactic processing in a
nonhuman primate. Science, 303(5656), 377-380. 
Where does the ape hit the wall? 
SO....maybe there is a little bit of evidence for Grammar 
Is animal communication PRODUCTIVE (Does it show generativity)? 
Is this the unbridgable gap? 
Why does this matter?
