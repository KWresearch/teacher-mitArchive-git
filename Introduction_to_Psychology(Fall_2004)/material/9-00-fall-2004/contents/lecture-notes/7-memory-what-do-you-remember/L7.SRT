6
00:00:15 --> 00:00:23
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon
here is the plan for

7
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
today's lecture.
 

8
00:00:26 --> 00:00:31
 
 

9
00:00:31 --> 00:00:38
There is out there somewhere,
unless you're philosopher,

10
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
a world, it's huge.
 

11
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
A lot of stuff out
there in the world.

12
00:00:43 --> 00:00:53
Their is inside use somewhere
a long term memory,

13
00:00:53 --> 00:00:57
which is also huge.
 

14
00:00:57 --> 00:01:02
And and hopefully getting
huger all the time.

15
00:01:02 --> 00:01:05
 
 

16
00:01:05 --> 00:01:14
You cannot transcribe all of
that world from the outside

17
00:01:14 --> 00:01:17
into your long term memory, as
you may have already discovered

18
00:01:17 --> 00:01:22
if you've had a test this term.
 

19
00:01:22 --> 00:01:27
And in a move that ought to
looks familiar to you by now.

20
00:01:27 --> 00:01:35
We can described that as a
bottleneck of some sort.

21
00:01:35 --> 00:01:37
Not the same bottleneck that I
was talking about in the

22
00:01:37 --> 00:01:41
context of attention, but a
bottleneck nevertheless, that

23
00:01:41 --> 00:01:50
is involved in providing and
putting a severe limitation on

24
00:01:50 --> 00:01:55
the ability to encode the
world into long term memory.

25
00:01:55 --> 00:01:58
The first part of today's
lecture is going to be about

26
00:01:58 --> 00:02:04
this problem of encoding and
about the nature of

27
00:02:04 --> 00:02:05
this bottleneck.
 

28
00:02:05 --> 00:02:12
The second part is it that OK
some stuff, a mere trickle of

29
00:02:12 --> 00:02:18
the world, managed to get
through this bottleneck.

30
00:02:18 --> 00:02:19
It needs to stay there.
 

31
00:02:19 --> 00:02:22
It needs to stay there
for a long time.

32
00:02:22 --> 00:02:27
You've got things in here, in
this long term memory of yours,

33
00:02:27 --> 00:02:35
that are 15, 16 years old,
maybe more at this point.

34
00:02:35 --> 00:02:42
How they stay here, how
they are made firm, is the

35
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
problem of consolidation.
 

36
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
Which it would say underneath
there if it wasn't that

37
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
I put a screen in front.
 

38
00:02:49 --> 00:02:54
And finally, it is of
absolutely no use to you have

39
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
-- as you also may have
discovered on some exam this

40
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
term already -- to have a long
term memory that is absolutely

41
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04
chock full of marvelous
material if you can't

42
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
get it back out.
 

43
00:03:06 --> 00:03:11
Unlike the story that we
were telling before about

44
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
perception, where there is a
world of bottleneck and then

45
00:03:14 --> 00:03:18
some construct that was your
perception of the world.

46
00:03:18 --> 00:03:22
In this case you've got a two
way street, that you cannot

47
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
appreciates the full contents
of your long term memory

48
00:03:25 --> 00:03:26
at any given moment.
 

49
00:03:26 --> 00:03:29
You need to retrieve -- that's
what it says on the far board

50
00:03:29 --> 00:03:32
-- you need to be able to
retrieve material from long

51
00:03:32 --> 00:03:35
term memory, and bring
it back as we will see.

52
00:03:35 --> 00:03:39
In effect to bring it back
into the bottleneck.

53
00:03:39 --> 00:03:43
 
 

54
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
Got to be able to get back out
into this limited capacity

55
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
bottleneck where you can do
things like write down the

56
00:03:50 --> 00:03:54
answer on a test, or tell
me who's running for

57
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
president this year.
 

58
00:03:57 --> 00:03:57
Nobody.
 

59
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
AUDIENCE: Bush.
 

60
00:03:59 --> 00:04:00
PROFESSOR: Yeah
that's one of them.

61
00:04:00 --> 00:04:01
Bush yeah.
 

62
00:04:01 --> 00:04:02
AUDIENCE: Kerry
 

63
00:04:02 --> 00:04:02
PROFESSOR: Kerry OK.
 

64
00:04:02 --> 00:04:03
And a few other characters too.
 

65
00:04:03 --> 00:04:04
Right.
 

66
00:04:04 --> 00:04:05
OK.
 

67
00:04:05 --> 00:04:10
Presumably except for the most
politically obsessed among you,

68
00:04:10 --> 00:04:13
that was not an active thought
in your mind until I asked it.

69
00:04:13 --> 00:04:17
But Kerry and Bush live in
your long term memory,

70
00:04:17 --> 00:04:18
isn't that a scary thought?
 

71
00:04:18 --> 00:04:20
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

72
00:04:20 --> 00:04:23
PROFESSOR: And on demand, you
could retrieve that back

73
00:04:23 --> 00:04:28
out into what we will call
and your working memory.

74
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
If we were just thinking about
this and encoding terms, we

75
00:04:31 --> 00:04:36
might just call this short term
memory -- stuff comes in from

76
00:04:36 --> 00:04:40
the outside, it's maintained
for a little while somehow in a

77
00:04:40 --> 00:04:45
short term memory, and then
somehow makes it into long term

78
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
memory in ways that
we'll talk about.

79
00:04:47 --> 00:04:52
But if we think about this in a
two way, in a bi-directional

80
00:04:52 --> 00:04:56
kind of way, it's better
perhaps to think of this

81
00:04:56 --> 00:04:57
as your working memory.
 

82
00:04:57 --> 00:05:01
Think of it as your
computer desktop.

83
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
It's got access to all
the stuff that's on

84
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
your hard drive.
 

85
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
It's got access to
the external world.

86
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
You can tell it's got access
to the external -- oh no

87
00:05:10 --> 00:05:11
we can't see it there.
 

88
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
Well, you know, it's
wireless and so it's

89
00:05:13 --> 00:05:14
got access to the web.
 

90
00:05:14 --> 00:05:15
And so that's the
external world.

91
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
But only a limited amount
of it can be on the

92
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
desktop any one time.
 

93
00:05:20 --> 00:05:24
Similarly, only a limited
amount of either the world or

94
00:05:24 --> 00:05:27
the contents of your long
term memory can be on your

95
00:05:27 --> 00:05:30
mental desktop at one time.
 

96
00:05:30 --> 00:05:31
That's working memory.
 

97
00:05:31 --> 00:05:37
That's an important junk
of this bottleneck.

98
00:05:37 --> 00:05:43
Well what does it mean to say
that a limited capacity

99
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
bottleneck of some sort?
 

100
00:05:45 --> 00:05:49
Let me illustrate the
limit to that capacity.

101
00:05:49 --> 00:05:53
We saw a particular example of
that in what's known in the

102
00:05:53 --> 00:05:58
trade as visual short term
memory last week, when I was

103
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
putting up, you know, four
little colored blobs and

104
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
saying, OK now what changed.
 

105
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
And there's a limit of about
four objects that you

106
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
can keep track of.
 

107
00:06:08 --> 00:06:17
But in trying to ask what's the
limit of this bottleneck from

108
00:06:17 --> 00:06:21
the outside world into a more
long term varieties of memory,

109
00:06:21 --> 00:06:26
one of the typical measures
is what's called digit span.

110
00:06:26 --> 00:06:29
If you end up in the hospital
because somebody bopped you

111
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
over the head, one of the
things you neurologist would

112
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
do is read you a list of
numbers, and ask you

113
00:06:34 --> 00:06:35
to repeat them back.
 

114
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
And how many you can do is an
index of whether you are OK.

115
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
So let's see if you're OK.
 

116
00:06:42 --> 00:06:46
Except I won't do this
with numbers, I will do

117
00:06:46 --> 00:06:46
it with color names.
 

118
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
And we can come back
to that in a minute.

119
00:06:48 --> 00:06:50
Where are my color names?
 

120
00:06:50 --> 00:06:50
Here are my color names.
 

121
00:06:50 --> 00:06:53
So what I'm going to do is read
you a list of color names.

122
00:06:53 --> 00:06:56
I'll then say repeat, and
you in glorious unison

123
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
repeat this back to me.
 

124
00:06:58 --> 00:06:58
OK.
 

125
00:06:58 --> 00:07:03
So if I say, red,
blue, purple, repeat.

126
00:07:03 --> 00:07:04
You say?
 

127
00:07:04 --> 00:07:07
AUDIENCE: Red, blue, purple.
 

128
00:07:07 --> 00:07:08
PROFESSOR: It never fails.
 

129
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

130
00:07:10 --> 00:07:11
PROFESSOR: Right, [? Mara, ?]
 

131
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
last year too?
 

132
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
Always you get the
repeat back too.

133
00:07:15 --> 00:07:18
And I'm not sure what it is
about this that demands, that

134
00:07:18 --> 00:07:20
at least from some people,
the repeats of repeat.

135
00:07:20 --> 00:07:21
But in any case good, good.
 

136
00:07:21 --> 00:07:25
You're not deeply
brain damaged yet.

137
00:07:25 --> 00:07:26
Ready?
 

138
00:07:26 --> 00:07:27
We'll do some more of these.
 

139
00:07:27 --> 00:07:34
Green, pink, yellow,
white yellow, repeat.

140
00:07:34 --> 00:07:41
AUDIENCE: Green, pink,
yellow, white, yellow.

141
00:07:41 --> 00:07:42
PROFESSOR: OK.
 

142
00:07:42 --> 00:07:43
That was fine.
 

143
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
All right, here we go.
 

144
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
Oh, I forgot to mention.
 

145
00:07:48 --> 00:07:52
It turns out to be really easy
to repeat back in essentially

146
00:07:52 --> 00:07:56
infinitely long list of these,
if you write them down

147
00:07:56 --> 00:07:57
while I'm saying them.
 

148
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

149
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
PROFESSOR: There are a variety
of demos that I'm going to do

150
00:08:01 --> 00:08:06
today that are of that form,
and it's really boring.

151
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
So, you know, OK we know you
can do that, so don't do

152
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
that, because that's boring.
 

153
00:08:11 --> 00:08:12
Be a nice honest person.
 

154
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
OK ready?
 

155
00:08:14 --> 00:08:15
Where was I.
 

156
00:08:15 --> 00:08:15
I just did 5, right?
 

157
00:08:15 --> 00:08:16
Let's try 7.
 

158
00:08:16 --> 00:08:17
Ready?
 

159
00:08:17 --> 00:08:18
Oh and I told you when
I'm going to stop.

160
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
Oh what the heck.
 

161
00:08:20 --> 00:08:29
Pink, red, yellow, green,
purple, pink, orange, repeat.

162
00:08:29 --> 00:08:35
AUDIENCE: Pink, red, yellow,
green, purple, pink, orange.

163
00:08:35 --> 00:08:37
PROFESSOR: It's getting a
little weak there at the end.

164
00:08:37 --> 00:08:41
But you will see, if you look
at the handout, you will see

165
00:08:41 --> 00:08:45
that the answer to this
question is given in the title

166
00:08:45 --> 00:08:47
of George Miller's classic
paper on the subject.

167
00:08:47 --> 00:08:51
And is answer is 7 plus or
minus 2, and some of you

168
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
were on the minus side.
 

169
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
Oh I should also say -- I
should've said this at the

170
00:08:56 --> 00:09:01
beginning of the course --
people in intro psych classes,

171
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
particularly by the time you
get around starting to talk

172
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
about cognitive things, like
memory, take demos very

173
00:09:07 --> 00:09:15
personally and think 7 plus
or minus 2, I got minus.

174
00:09:15 --> 00:09:15
I'm doomed.
 

175
00:09:15 --> 00:09:19
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

176
00:09:19 --> 00:09:20
PROFESSOR: You're
probably fine.

177
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
I mean if you, if it was the
red, yellow, purple, you're

178
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
saying what was the
one after red.

179
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
You know I admit there
might be an issue there.

180
00:09:27 --> 00:09:32
 
 

181
00:09:32 --> 00:09:35
The advantage of a 300 person
intro class is we're looking at

182
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
the average, and what you're
doing on any given single

183
00:09:38 --> 00:09:43
isolated demo trial is not
actually deeply relevant to

184
00:09:43 --> 00:09:46
whether or not you're going to
pass physics for instance.

185
00:09:46 --> 00:09:47
OK, one more.
 

186
00:09:47 --> 00:09:48
Ready?
 

187
00:09:48 --> 00:09:58
Blue, green, purple, red,
pink, yellow, green, blue,

188
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
white, orange, repeat.
 

189
00:10:01 --> 00:10:08
AUDIENCE: Blue, green,
purple, red, green, yellow

190
00:10:08 --> 00:10:11
[LAUGHTER]
 

191
00:10:11 --> 00:10:12
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 

192
00:10:12 --> 00:10:15
 
 

193
00:10:15 --> 00:10:16
You can hear.
 

194
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
That was 10.
 

195
00:10:18 --> 00:10:21
And you could here it in the
group, and you could probably

196
00:10:21 --> 00:10:25
feel it in yourself, that, you
know, up to 6, 7, 8, you're

197
00:10:25 --> 00:10:26
yeah, we're good here.
 

198
00:10:26 --> 00:10:28
Oh man if I start taking
in this next one, that

199
00:10:28 --> 00:10:30
I'm losing them here.
 

200
00:10:30 --> 00:10:31
Something bad is happening.
 

201
00:10:31 --> 00:10:38
So there's this capacity limit
on what you can get into --

202
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
well let's used this jargon for
the time being -- into some

203
00:10:40 --> 00:10:43
sort of short term memory,
and then spit out

204
00:10:43 --> 00:10:44
immediately to me.
 

205
00:10:44 --> 00:10:49
Now 7 plus or minus to what?
 

206
00:10:49 --> 00:10:50
Let's try another one.
 

207
00:10:50 --> 00:10:51
You ready?
 

208
00:10:51 --> 00:10:54
Same game.
 

209
00:10:54 --> 00:11:04
Red, red, red, red, blue, blue,
blue, blue, green, green,

210
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
green, green, repeat.
 

211
00:11:07 --> 00:11:09
AUDIENCE: Red --
 

212
00:11:09 --> 00:11:10
[LAUGHTER]
 

213
00:11:10 --> 00:11:13
PROFESSOR: You know
you can do this.

214
00:11:13 --> 00:11:14
That's 12 items.
 

215
00:11:14 --> 00:11:19
How come I all of a sudden
manage to boost your

216
00:11:19 --> 00:11:22
memories so effectively?
 

217
00:11:22 --> 00:11:25
Yeah classification, or what
Miller originally, and the

218
00:11:25 --> 00:11:28
field had stuck with the
notion of chunking.

219
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
If you can break things into
meaningful chunks , it's

220
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
7 plus or minus 2 chunks.
 

221
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
And what's important is how
you managed to cut the

222
00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
world into chunks.
 

223
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
This by the way explains why
I don't do this demo in the

224
00:11:43 --> 00:11:49
traditional way of giving
you digit strings.

225
00:11:49 --> 00:11:54
Because years ago I discovered
that if you give somebody a 10

226
00:11:54 --> 00:11:59
digit, you know, give 300 MIT
undergraduates a 10 digit

227
00:11:59 --> 00:12:01
string, you know, a bunch of
them crud out on you, but then

228
00:12:01 --> 00:12:04
there's a handful of people who
just raddle it right off.

229
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
And you say oh my goodness,
these people have

230
00:12:06 --> 00:12:07
this amazing memory.
 

231
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
And you ask them
how'd you do it?

232
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
And they say oh well
that was obvious.

233
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
It was the natural log of 16.
 

234
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

235
00:12:16 --> 00:12:20
PROFESSOR: MIT students tend
to junk numbers rather more

236
00:12:20 --> 00:12:23
readily than the rest
of the population.

237
00:12:23 --> 00:12:27
They don't tend to junk color
names particularly adeptly I've

238
00:12:27 --> 00:12:32
found, and so you get the right
7 plus or minus 2 answer.

239
00:12:32 --> 00:12:37
Now this sort of chunking,
you should think of this

240
00:12:37 --> 00:12:38
more like a rate right.
 

241
00:12:38 --> 00:12:42
It's not 7 plus or minus 2
things ever, ever, ever.

242
00:12:42 --> 00:12:46
It's 7 plus or minus 2 things
in some unit of time that you

243
00:12:46 --> 00:12:47
can manage to deal with.
 

244
00:12:47 --> 00:12:51
Otherwise as soon as I had
presented 7 plus or minus 2

245
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
units of information in this
lecture, you'd be like dead

246
00:12:54 --> 00:12:55
for the rest of the day.
 

247
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
Or maybe, you know, the first
lecture shot your brain and

248
00:12:58 --> 00:13:00
that was it for the term.
 

249
00:13:00 --> 00:13:02
That's obviously not the case.
 

250
00:13:02 --> 00:13:06
What the question is how big a
chunk can you manage to cut

251
00:13:06 --> 00:13:09
things into as it's coming in.
 

252
00:13:09 --> 00:13:15
One of the places you can see
that is in language as you're

253
00:13:15 --> 00:13:19
trying to keep track for
instance, what I'm saying.

254
00:13:19 --> 00:13:26
So if I ask you to repeat this
sentence, memory is a

255
00:13:26 --> 00:13:29
fascinating topic that would be
on the final exam,

256
00:13:29 --> 00:13:31
you would say?
 

257
00:13:31 --> 00:13:33
AUDIENCE: Memory is a
fascinating topic that would

258
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
be on the final exam.
 

259
00:13:35 --> 00:13:39
PROFESSOR: But if I lettuce,
quadrangle forms only only

260
00:13:39 --> 00:13:42
column bug de la forms
aftunic reply quintilian.

261
00:13:42 --> 00:13:43
Kelly You say?
 

262
00:13:43 --> 00:13:46
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

263
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
PROFESSOR: Say it roughly the
same number of syllables.

264
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
But ouughh.
 

265
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
You know, you can't repeat
that back, because

266
00:13:53 --> 00:13:54
you can't chunk it.
 

267
00:13:54 --> 00:13:57
Well you can, but the chunks
that you were making were too

268
00:13:57 --> 00:14:01
small to survive the rate
at which they were

269
00:14:01 --> 00:14:03
being presented.
 

270
00:14:03 --> 00:14:06
So everybody here, if forced
to, would've produce

271
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
some little bit of it.
 

272
00:14:08 --> 00:14:13
But people would not be able
to produce the whole thing,

273
00:14:13 --> 00:14:16
because you can't chunk it into
meaningful chunks that work.

274
00:14:16 --> 00:14:20
This is also the route
presumably of the near

275
00:14:20 --> 00:14:25
universal experience that when
you go to some other country

276
00:14:25 --> 00:14:28
where they speak another
language, that you nominally

277
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
speak because you took four
years of it in high school.

278
00:14:31 --> 00:14:36
You discover that those
Parisians or those Spaniards or

279
00:14:36 --> 00:14:40
the Japanese or whoever talk
really, really, really fast.

280
00:14:40 --> 00:14:42
What's the chance that
everybody else in the

281
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
world talks really,
really, really fast.

282
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
You know, it's not
true of course.

283
00:14:46 --> 00:14:50
And those of you who are
non-native English speakers,

284
00:14:50 --> 00:14:54
and have now arrived at MIT,
are thinking no, you know,

285
00:14:54 --> 00:14:58
back in, you know, Kazakhstan
they all spoke really

286
00:14:58 --> 00:14:59
slowly or whatever.
 

287
00:14:59 --> 00:15:02
But these English
speakers are wackos.

288
00:15:02 --> 00:15:05
The problem is you are in your
native tongue, or in any town

289
00:15:05 --> 00:15:07
but you are really fluent in.
 

290
00:15:07 --> 00:15:12
You are very good at cutting
into meaningful chunks rapidly.

291
00:15:12 --> 00:15:15
If you're busy trying to
say, what was that word.

292
00:15:15 --> 00:15:15
I know.
 

293
00:15:15 --> 00:15:17
I damn it that was the
week I was asleep in high

294
00:15:17 --> 00:15:18
school or something.
 

295
00:15:18 --> 00:15:18
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHER]
 

296
00:15:18 --> 00:15:20
PROFESSOR: No that was the year
I was asleep in high school.

297
00:15:20 --> 00:15:20
Anyway.
 

298
00:15:20 --> 00:15:24
 
 

299
00:15:24 --> 00:15:28
The chunks go by too fast
like in the nonsense that

300
00:15:28 --> 00:15:34
I was producing for you.
 

301
00:15:34 --> 00:15:41
You're set up to get chunks
through in some domains much

302
00:15:41 --> 00:15:42
better than in others.
 

303
00:15:42 --> 00:15:46
And in fact, let me
illustrate that here.

304
00:15:46 --> 00:15:48
By where did I hide?
 

305
00:15:48 --> 00:15:50
That looks like
it's probably it.

306
00:15:50 --> 00:15:51
All right.
 

307
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
Got to memorize some
more stuff here.

308
00:15:53 --> 00:15:54
Come on.
 

309
00:15:54 --> 00:15:55
You want to go.
 

310
00:15:55 --> 00:15:58
And there we go.
 

311
00:15:58 --> 00:16:00
Too much light.
 

312
00:16:00 --> 00:16:04
Let's kill the stage lights.
 

313
00:16:04 --> 00:16:05
Good.
 

314
00:16:05 --> 00:16:07
OK.
 

315
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
I want you to memorize
all these pictures.

316
00:16:10 --> 00:16:12
You ready?
 

317
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
There's a picture.
 

318
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
And there's a picture.
 

319
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
And that's a picture.
 

320
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
And there's the back
end of a horse or two.

321
00:16:21 --> 00:16:23
And there's a Christmas
tree or something.

322
00:16:23 --> 00:16:28
And I don't know I must've
rated a housing site.

323
00:16:28 --> 00:16:30
But, you know, these are
definitely pictures.

324
00:16:30 --> 00:16:31
And that's a picture.
 

325
00:16:31 --> 00:16:33
And that looks like a picture.
 

326
00:16:33 --> 00:16:35
And oh look there's tomatoes.
 

327
00:16:35 --> 00:16:36
OK.
 

328
00:16:36 --> 00:16:37
Got them all?
 

329
00:16:37 --> 00:16:38
AUDIENCE: Yes.
 

330
00:16:38 --> 00:16:41
PROFESSOR: OK now what I want
you to do is, I'm going to show

331
00:16:41 --> 00:16:44
you some pictures that are
either old or new, and you just

332
00:16:44 --> 00:16:48
say yes if you've seen it
before, no if you havent.

333
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
AUDIENCE: No.
 

334
00:16:50 --> 00:16:51
No.
 

335
00:16:51 --> 00:16:53
Yes.
 

336
00:16:53 --> 00:16:54
Yes.
 

337
00:16:54 --> 00:16:55
No.
 

338
00:16:55 --> 00:17:00
Yes Yes, No.
 

339
00:17:00 --> 00:17:01
No.
 

340
00:17:01 --> 00:17:02
Yes.
 

341
00:17:02 --> 00:17:04
No.
 

342
00:17:04 --> 00:17:05
PROFESSOR: OK.
 

343
00:17:05 --> 00:17:10
The important point is that
you're very good at this.

344
00:17:10 --> 00:17:15
The interesting side point is
that this particular one is

345
00:17:15 --> 00:17:16
flipped left, right, reverse.
 

346
00:17:16 --> 00:17:18
So if you were sitting there
saying why are these people

347
00:17:18 --> 00:17:20
next to me changing their mind.
 

348
00:17:20 --> 00:17:23
It's because some people
noticed that it was

349
00:17:23 --> 00:17:24
left, right, reverse.
 

350
00:17:24 --> 00:17:29
But if I had lots of time,
I could have done this

351
00:17:29 --> 00:17:31
with a lot of pictures.
 

352
00:17:31 --> 00:17:37
The largest report in the
literature is 10,000 pictures

353
00:17:37 --> 00:17:42
shown to the usual collection
of college undergraduates.

354
00:17:42 --> 00:17:47
And some days later, the
students still remembered

355
00:17:47 --> 00:17:53
I think it's about
80% accuracy on that.

356
00:17:53 --> 00:17:57
If I read you 10,000 color
names -- well there aren't

357
00:17:57 --> 00:18:02
10,000 color names -- if I read
you 10,000 words or almost any

358
00:18:02 --> 00:18:06
other material that I would
care to present to you, you

359
00:18:06 --> 00:18:08
would do nowhere near as well.
 

360
00:18:08 --> 00:18:11
We're not entirely clear
on how you do this.

361
00:18:11 --> 00:18:13
This is quite a
remarkable ability.

362
00:18:13 --> 00:18:19
But it does speak to the
ability of picture information.

363
00:18:19 --> 00:18:22
Familiarity with a picture.
 

364
00:18:22 --> 00:18:24
Getting through this bottleneck
into some sort of long term

365
00:18:24 --> 00:18:28
memory with remarkable
efficiency, that you are

366
00:18:28 --> 00:18:31
somehow specialized
for doing that.

367
00:18:31 --> 00:18:34
There's also a little
bit of a cheat here.

368
00:18:34 --> 00:18:35
It's only a little bit
of a cheat, but it's

369
00:18:35 --> 00:18:36
an interesting cheat.
 

370
00:18:36 --> 00:18:40
This was a recognition test.
 

371
00:18:40 --> 00:18:44
The color one, the previous
demos were recall test.

372
00:18:44 --> 00:18:47
I was asking you what, you
know, pull out of your

373
00:18:47 --> 00:18:48
memory what was there.
 

374
00:18:48 --> 00:18:51
Here I was saying
was this there.

375
00:18:51 --> 00:18:52
And you know this.
 

376
00:18:52 --> 00:18:57
But, from your test taking
experience you know that, OK if

377
00:18:57 --> 00:18:59
I give you a choice between
fill in the blank and multiple

378
00:18:59 --> 00:19:01
choice, which do
you want to do?

379
00:19:01 --> 00:19:03
AUDIENCE: Multiple choice.
 

380
00:19:03 --> 00:19:04
PROFESSOR: Multiple
choice, because that's

381
00:19:04 --> 00:19:06
a recognition test.
 

382
00:19:06 --> 00:19:09
Fill in the blank
is recall test.

383
00:19:09 --> 00:19:14
The distinction is OK here's
your long term memory.

384
00:19:14 --> 00:19:18
Here's the target that you're
trying to find in long

385
00:19:18 --> 00:19:20
term memory somewhere.
 

386
00:19:20 --> 00:19:26
If I'm doing a recall test, I'm
saying, you know, go find this

387
00:19:26 --> 00:19:30
thing in all the vast halls of
your long term memory, and you

388
00:19:30 --> 00:19:33
send some little probe out
into long term memory that

389
00:19:33 --> 00:19:35
may or may not find it.
 

390
00:19:35 --> 00:19:40
If I say is this in there.
 

391
00:19:40 --> 00:19:42
That's an obviously simpler
matching kind of task.

392
00:19:42 --> 00:19:48
And you are typically much
better at doing recognition

393
00:19:48 --> 00:19:54
than you are at doing recall.
 

394
00:19:54 --> 00:19:59
So you have presumably special
purpose mechanisms in your

395
00:19:59 --> 00:20:04
system that are really
good at doing some tasks.

396
00:20:04 --> 00:20:09
What do you do in the case
of those unfortunate tasks.

397
00:20:09 --> 00:20:12
Actually I don't need
that anymore at all.

398
00:20:12 --> 00:20:14
In those case of those
unfortunate tasks which you

399
00:20:14 --> 00:20:16
were not well designed to do.
 

400
00:20:16 --> 00:20:21
For instance the memorization
of neuroanatomical terms for

401
00:20:21 --> 00:20:24
a midterm in intro psych,
which is only the beginning.

402
00:20:24 --> 00:20:28
How many people over here
are pre-meds or think

403
00:20:28 --> 00:20:29
they might be pre-meds?
 

404
00:20:29 --> 00:20:33
You guys are the ones who are
going to devote years of your

405
00:20:33 --> 00:20:37
life to the memorization
of things that you were

406
00:20:37 --> 00:20:39
not built to memorize.
 

407
00:20:39 --> 00:20:43
Like where all the bones
are, and stuff like that.

408
00:20:43 --> 00:20:45
So how do you do that?
 

409
00:20:45 --> 00:20:50
Let's try memorizing
some nonsense.

410
00:20:50 --> 00:20:54
 
 

411
00:20:54 --> 00:20:55
Go to sleep.
 

412
00:20:55 --> 00:20:56
Why don't you want
to go to sleep.

413
00:20:56 --> 00:20:58
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

414
00:20:58 --> 00:21:01
PROFESSOR: It's like
your children.

415
00:21:01 --> 00:21:02
Mara, what do you do?
 

416
00:21:02 --> 00:21:04
 
 

417
00:21:04 --> 00:21:06
I don't want to know OK.
 

418
00:21:06 --> 00:21:07
You mean I'm
supposed to hit it?

419
00:21:07 --> 00:21:09
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

420
00:21:09 --> 00:21:10
PROFESSOR: Oh OK.
 

421
00:21:10 --> 00:21:13
All right.
 

422
00:21:13 --> 00:21:15
It went to sleep.
 

423
00:21:15 --> 00:21:17
It happens from time to time.
 

424
00:21:17 --> 00:21:18
Anyway where were we.
 

425
00:21:18 --> 00:21:20
Oh yes nonsense.
 

426
00:21:20 --> 00:21:23
This is a line of work that
starts really with a guy named

427
00:21:23 --> 00:21:26
Ebbinghaus in Germany in the
late 19th century, who wanted

428
00:21:26 --> 00:21:28
to understand memory processes.
 

429
00:21:28 --> 00:21:33
He's in isolation from these
issues about meaning.

430
00:21:33 --> 00:21:38
And so what he did was he got
himself actually for starters

431
00:21:38 --> 00:21:43
to memorize nonsense syllables
that allegedly had no meaning.

432
00:21:43 --> 00:21:46
It's extremely hard to find
material that has no meaning.

433
00:21:46 --> 00:21:50
But I will attempt to
read you some now.

434
00:21:50 --> 00:21:52
Grab a hunk of paper.
 

435
00:21:52 --> 00:21:54
I don't want your writing them
down while I read them to you,

436
00:21:54 --> 00:21:58
but I do want you to be in a
position to write all the words

437
00:21:58 --> 00:22:02
down when I tell you
it's time to write.

438
00:22:02 --> 00:22:08
Oh while you're doing that, let
me make my annual disclaimer.

439
00:22:08 --> 00:22:12
MIT is a hugely
multicultural institution.

440
00:22:12 --> 00:22:15
You speak a vast
range of languages.

441
00:22:15 --> 00:22:18
To my knowledge what I am
saying is meaningless.

442
00:22:18 --> 00:22:22
If it turns out that it is
meaningful, particularly if it

443
00:22:22 --> 00:22:26
turns out that it's like deeply
profane, do let me know later

444
00:22:26 --> 00:22:29
and I will change my
nonsense yet again.

445
00:22:29 --> 00:22:32
I have over the years said
a number of absolutely

446
00:22:32 --> 00:22:34
remarkable things.
 

447
00:22:34 --> 00:22:39
Including something in Mali so
good that the young women who

448
00:22:39 --> 00:22:43
told me I couldn't say it,
wouldn't tell me what

449
00:22:43 --> 00:22:44
it was I had said.
 

450
00:22:44 --> 00:22:45
But --
 

451
00:22:45 --> 00:22:45
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

452
00:22:45 --> 00:22:48
PROFESSOR: -- they looked
at my list and they just

453
00:22:48 --> 00:22:50
crossed these things out.
 

454
00:22:50 --> 00:22:51
Anyway.
 

455
00:22:51 --> 00:22:55
So it's mostly gone.
 

456
00:22:55 --> 00:22:57
So all right.
 

457
00:22:57 --> 00:22:58
You're ready to write?
 

458
00:22:58 --> 00:23:02
I'm going to read you a bunch
of nonsense syllables, and

459
00:23:02 --> 00:23:06
you're going to write
them all down.

460
00:23:06 --> 00:23:09
Ready OK.
 

461
00:23:09 --> 00:23:11
Fip.
 

462
00:23:11 --> 00:23:14
Dut.
 

463
00:23:14 --> 00:23:16
Moche.
 

464
00:23:16 --> 00:23:19
Yill.
 

465
00:23:19 --> 00:23:21
Saz.
 

466
00:23:21 --> 00:23:24
Tirt.
 

467
00:23:24 --> 00:23:26
Varl.
 

468
00:23:26 --> 00:23:29
Bince.
 

469
00:23:29 --> 00:23:32
Jucks.
 

470
00:23:32 --> 00:23:34
Gouf.
 

471
00:23:34 --> 00:23:37
Zauce.
 

472
00:23:37 --> 00:23:39
Rab.
 

473
00:23:39 --> 00:23:40
OK.
 

474
00:23:40 --> 00:23:41
Write down everything
you can remember.

475
00:23:41 --> 00:23:51
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

476
00:23:51 --> 00:23:52
PROFESSOR: Now don't
copy off your neighbor.

477
00:23:52 --> 00:24:03
 
 

478
00:24:03 --> 00:24:12
On your hand out on the second
page I believe, you will find

479
00:24:12 --> 00:24:17
the axes for what's called
the serial position curves.

480
00:24:17 --> 00:24:19
Which is the way we want
to represent the data

481
00:24:19 --> 00:24:21
from this experiment.
 

482
00:24:21 --> 00:24:26
We want to represent percentage
recall, which in this case will

483
00:24:26 --> 00:24:29
be in sort of number of
hands, as a function of

484
00:24:29 --> 00:24:31
position in the list.
 

485
00:24:31 --> 00:24:38
Where in the list that I
read did the word show up.

486
00:24:38 --> 00:24:40
And I will tell you the answer
at ahead of time, and then

487
00:24:40 --> 00:24:44
we'll check if it worked.
 

488
00:24:44 --> 00:24:50
The answer is that the
data will look like this.

489
00:24:50 --> 00:24:56
There will be what's known as a
primacy effect, where you'll

490
00:24:56 --> 00:24:59
remember the first words
in the list quite well.

491
00:24:59 --> 00:25:07
And a recency affect, with
some preservation of the

492
00:25:07 --> 00:25:08
last words in the list.
 

493
00:25:08 --> 00:25:12
That at least is my assertion.
 

494
00:25:12 --> 00:25:16
Let us actually check
the data here.

495
00:25:16 --> 00:25:19
How many people got fib?
 

496
00:25:19 --> 00:25:22
 
 

497
00:25:22 --> 00:25:22
Alright.
 

498
00:25:22 --> 00:25:25
Data point turns out to
be about there I think.

499
00:25:25 --> 00:25:27
How many people got dut?
 

500
00:25:27 --> 00:25:30
 
 

501
00:25:30 --> 00:25:32
Few, fewer.
 

502
00:25:32 --> 00:25:35
How many people got -- well
you see your falling a

503
00:25:35 --> 00:25:36
little below the line here.
 

504
00:25:36 --> 00:25:38
I am worried about you guys.
 

505
00:25:38 --> 00:25:42
How many got tirt?
 

506
00:25:42 --> 00:25:46
Ouhh how interesting.
 

507
00:25:46 --> 00:25:49
How many people got varl?
 

508
00:25:49 --> 00:25:52
Ouhh that's pretty pathetic.
 

509
00:25:52 --> 00:25:55
How many people got zauce.
 

510
00:25:55 --> 00:25:56
Oh coming back.
 

511
00:25:56 --> 00:25:57
Oh that's pretty good actually.
 

512
00:25:57 --> 00:25:58
That's above the line here.
 

513
00:25:58 --> 00:26:02
And how many people got rab?
 

514
00:26:02 --> 00:26:04
That's sort of thereish.
 

515
00:26:04 --> 00:26:05
OK.
 

516
00:26:05 --> 00:26:07
What's with tirt?
 

517
00:26:07 --> 00:26:09
[LAUGHTER]
 

518
00:26:09 --> 00:26:10
You guys did bet it.
 

519
00:26:10 --> 00:26:14
Well you know, teaching
concourse this morning, I

520
00:26:14 --> 00:26:18
discovered that one of my words
has currently acquired a slang

521
00:26:18 --> 00:26:20
meaning that I'd never
heard of before.

522
00:26:20 --> 00:26:25
So tirt you just got lucky on,
or tirt suddenly means --

523
00:26:25 --> 00:26:27
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

524
00:26:27 --> 00:26:30
PROFESSOR: What's a tirt?
 

525
00:26:30 --> 00:26:30
What?
 

526
00:26:30 --> 00:26:33
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

527
00:26:33 --> 00:26:34
PROFESSOR: Tert.
 

528
00:26:34 --> 00:26:37
Oh oh tert like as in
tertiary or something?

529
00:26:37 --> 00:26:37
AUDIENCE: Yes.
 

530
00:26:37 --> 00:26:40
PROFESSOR: Oh, see I'm
spelling it t-i-r-t, and

531
00:26:40 --> 00:26:42
it never occurred to me.
 

532
00:26:42 --> 00:26:43
All right, all right.
 

533
00:26:43 --> 00:26:45
We're going to have to do
something about tirt.

534
00:26:45 --> 00:26:46
Anyway.
 

535
00:26:46 --> 00:26:49
 
 

536
00:26:49 --> 00:26:50
OK.
 

537
00:26:50 --> 00:26:53
The question here is going
to be how did you do it?

538
00:26:53 --> 00:26:57
Part of the answer is clearly
any word that happened to make

539
00:26:57 --> 00:27:03
some sort of meaningful
association to you is going to

540
00:27:03 --> 00:27:07
have a preferential chance of
getting into long term memory.

541
00:27:07 --> 00:27:09
Where did my beautiful
little map of the world go?

542
00:27:09 --> 00:27:11
It must be underneath there.
 

543
00:27:11 --> 00:27:15
You go up.
 

544
00:27:15 --> 00:27:20
One way to think about this
is sort of by analogy

545
00:27:20 --> 00:27:21
to immigration.
 

546
00:27:21 --> 00:27:27
You know here's America, and
here are all of our various

547
00:27:27 --> 00:27:29
forebearances and stuff trying
to get into the country.

548
00:27:29 --> 00:27:32
And there's this choke
point at immigration.

549
00:27:32 --> 00:27:39
You know, if you got your Uncle
Charlie already in the country,

550
00:27:39 --> 00:27:44
he can pull you in ways that if
you have no relations here

551
00:27:44 --> 00:27:46
it's harder to get in.
 

552
00:27:46 --> 00:27:49
So if tirt reminded you of
tertiary, that's Uncle

553
00:27:49 --> 00:27:52
Tertiary in long term memory.
 

554
00:27:52 --> 00:27:53
Sort of pulling you through.
 

555
00:27:53 --> 00:27:57
But the question is what do you
do if you don't have that?

556
00:27:57 --> 00:27:59
So the things at the beginning.
 

557
00:27:59 --> 00:28:02
Anybody got any intuition about
what they were doing with fip

558
00:28:02 --> 00:28:06
and dut and stuff like that?
 

559
00:28:06 --> 00:28:07
Yeah, Yeah, OK.
 

560
00:28:07 --> 00:28:10
AUDIENCE: I was writing
down this fip and dut.

561
00:28:10 --> 00:28:11
PROFESSOR: Oh OK.
 

562
00:28:11 --> 00:28:13
Apart from the fact that you
were -- no, no, you presumably

563
00:28:13 --> 00:28:15
were being a good person and
not writing them down when I

564
00:28:15 --> 00:28:16
read them first though right?
 

565
00:28:16 --> 00:28:17
OK.
 

566
00:28:17 --> 00:28:19
So what were you doing
while you were waiting

567
00:28:19 --> 00:28:23
to dump them back out?
 

568
00:28:23 --> 00:28:23
Yeah.
 

569
00:28:23 --> 00:28:24
AUDIENCE: I mean I was going
over them in my head.

570
00:28:24 --> 00:28:25
Rehearsing them.
 

571
00:28:25 --> 00:28:26
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
 

572
00:28:26 --> 00:28:26
OK.
 

573
00:28:26 --> 00:28:28
You were sitting
there rehearsing.

574
00:28:28 --> 00:28:29
How many people had the
experience that they were

575
00:28:29 --> 00:28:33
rehearsing, and discovering
that oh man there's more stuff

576
00:28:33 --> 00:28:35
here than I can rehearse?
 

577
00:28:35 --> 00:28:37
That's the capacity
limit again.

578
00:28:37 --> 00:28:40
But there's a rehearsal loop
for auditorium material

579
00:28:40 --> 00:28:45
sometimes called a
phonological loop.

580
00:28:45 --> 00:28:48
Does it say phonological loop
on the handout anywhere?

581
00:28:48 --> 00:28:49
No.
 

582
00:28:49 --> 00:28:50
Well.
 

583
00:28:50 --> 00:28:55
You know, phono like
phonograph, phonological.

584
00:28:55 --> 00:28:59
Where you repeat this stuff to
hold it in this working memory.

585
00:28:59 --> 00:29:02
Keep it alive in
working memory.

586
00:29:02 --> 00:29:07
And in that way sort
of keep it alive.

587
00:29:07 --> 00:29:11
 
 

588
00:29:11 --> 00:29:13
Anybody got a different
experience for zauce and

589
00:29:13 --> 00:29:15
rab at the end of there?
 

590
00:29:15 --> 00:29:18
 
 

591
00:29:18 --> 00:29:20
I'm sorry I heard something
that sounded promising.

592
00:29:20 --> 00:29:21
Yeah?
 

593
00:29:21 --> 00:29:21
AUDIENCE: They were just there.
 

594
00:29:21 --> 00:29:21
PROFESSOR: They
 

595
00:29:21 --> 00:29:27
were just there is actually
the right intuition.

596
00:29:27 --> 00:29:32
It was almost like you
could still hear them.

597
00:29:32 --> 00:29:34
They didn't need to
be preserved yet.

598
00:29:34 --> 00:29:37
They were still fresh
and hadn't rotted.

599
00:29:37 --> 00:29:41
The claim though is that the
process that gives you the

600
00:29:41 --> 00:29:43
recency effect is different
than the process that gives

601
00:29:43 --> 00:29:45
you the primacy effect.
 

602
00:29:45 --> 00:29:48
Let's give that a try.
 

603
00:29:48 --> 00:29:52
What I'll do is I'll read you
another list of nonsense

604
00:29:52 --> 00:29:54
like the first one.
 

605
00:29:54 --> 00:29:57
I'm going to ask you to write
them down again, but this time

606
00:29:57 --> 00:30:00
at the end instead of saying
write I'll say count.

607
00:30:00 --> 00:30:04
When I say count, I want you
to count backwards from

608
00:30:04 --> 00:30:07
431 by 3's out loud.
 

609
00:30:07 --> 00:30:09
You know all in
beautiful unison.

610
00:30:09 --> 00:30:11
Right got that?
 

611
00:30:11 --> 00:30:14
That would make a lot
of noise, so when I do

612
00:30:14 --> 00:30:15
this, keep an eye on me.
 

613
00:30:15 --> 00:30:18
When I do this, write
everything down.

614
00:30:18 --> 00:30:21
OK?
 

615
00:30:21 --> 00:30:22
OK.
 

616
00:30:22 --> 00:30:23
They kind of got
the instructions.

617
00:30:23 --> 00:30:25
All right, where's the
rest of my nonsense here?

618
00:30:25 --> 00:30:28
 
 

619
00:30:28 --> 00:30:29
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

620
00:30:29 --> 00:30:30
PROFESSOR: OK.
 

621
00:30:30 --> 00:30:33
 
 

622
00:30:33 --> 00:30:34
OK ready?
 

623
00:30:34 --> 00:30:38
 
 

624
00:30:38 --> 00:30:40
Sip.
 

625
00:30:40 --> 00:30:43
Forth.
 

626
00:30:43 --> 00:30:46
Lig.
 

627
00:30:46 --> 00:30:48
Vop.
 

628
00:30:48 --> 00:30:51
Hearn.
 

629
00:30:51 --> 00:30:53
Mope.
 

630
00:30:53 --> 00:30:56
Jick.
 

631
00:30:56 --> 00:30:59
Tinned.
 

632
00:30:59 --> 00:31:01
Mez.
 

633
00:31:01 --> 00:31:04
Wamp.
 

634
00:31:04 --> 00:31:07
Flob.
 

635
00:31:07 --> 00:31:09
Gone.
 

636
00:31:09 --> 00:31:09
OK.
 

637
00:31:09 --> 00:31:11
Count 431.
 

638
00:31:11 --> 00:31:11
AUDIENCE:
 

639
00:31:11 --> 00:31:13
431.
 

640
00:31:13 --> 00:31:18
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

641
00:31:18 --> 00:31:19
PROFESSOR: OK.
 

642
00:31:19 --> 00:31:20
Write them all down.
 

643
00:31:20 --> 00:31:21
The giggles would
probably do just fine.

644
00:31:21 --> 00:31:41
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

645
00:31:41 --> 00:31:41
PROFESSOR: OK.
 

646
00:31:41 --> 00:31:46
The claim here is that what
that should do, did you

647
00:31:46 --> 00:31:49
feel yourself rehearsing
the first ones again?

648
00:31:49 --> 00:31:50
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
 

649
00:31:50 --> 00:31:53
PROFESSOR: The claim is that
the primacy affect, which is

650
00:31:53 --> 00:31:57
due to some sort of rehearsal
into long term memory.

651
00:31:57 --> 00:32:01
That that primacy effect
should still be there.

652
00:32:01 --> 00:32:05
But the recency effect due to
some sort of it's just

653
00:32:05 --> 00:32:09
thereness, should have been
disrupted by the counting and

654
00:32:09 --> 00:32:10
the chordals and
stuff like that.

655
00:32:10 --> 00:32:11
OK.
 

656
00:32:11 --> 00:32:14
So let's check here,
where's my list gone to?

657
00:32:14 --> 00:32:15
Here list.
 

658
00:32:15 --> 00:32:17
I should remember this by now.
 

659
00:32:17 --> 00:32:17
OK.
 

660
00:32:17 --> 00:32:21
How many people got sip?
 

661
00:32:21 --> 00:32:21
And look.
 

662
00:32:21 --> 00:32:24
That's almost exactly
the same number.

663
00:32:24 --> 00:32:27
How many people got forth?
 

664
00:32:27 --> 00:32:27
Ooh.
 

665
00:32:27 --> 00:32:30
A lot of forths.
 

666
00:32:30 --> 00:32:34
How many people got jick?
 

667
00:32:34 --> 00:32:35
Ouhh deeply pathetic.
 

668
00:32:35 --> 00:32:37
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

669
00:32:37 --> 00:32:42
PROFESSOR: How many
people got mez?

670
00:32:42 --> 00:32:43
Few more.
 

671
00:32:43 --> 00:32:45
How many people got flob?
 

672
00:32:45 --> 00:32:49
Ouhh that's pretty pathetic.
 

673
00:32:49 --> 00:32:52
How many people got gone?
 

674
00:32:52 --> 00:32:53
No gone?
 

675
00:32:53 --> 00:32:55
Gone was pretty well gone.
 

676
00:32:55 --> 00:32:57
These were supposed to be
circles, So they'd be

677
00:32:57 --> 00:32:58
a different data set.
 

678
00:32:58 --> 00:33:02
So anyway, nice primacy effect.
 

679
00:33:02 --> 00:33:04
Recency effect gone.
 

680
00:33:04 --> 00:33:04
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

681
00:33:04 --> 00:33:05
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
 

682
00:33:05 --> 00:33:06
There are other words in there.
 

683
00:33:06 --> 00:33:10
This is the phenomenon of MIT
students really wanting to do

684
00:33:10 --> 00:33:12
well on these sort
of things right?

685
00:33:12 --> 00:33:13
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

686
00:33:13 --> 00:33:14
PROFESSOR: Man, he
didn't ask me.

687
00:33:14 --> 00:33:17
It's like, you know, you
have the same experience

688
00:33:17 --> 00:33:18
for keeps on the exam.
 

689
00:33:18 --> 00:33:21
You sit there and you study
chapter 3 until you're blue.

690
00:33:21 --> 00:33:25
And oh man they only
asked about chapter 2.

691
00:33:25 --> 00:33:26
So yeah, yeah, yeah.
 

692
00:33:26 --> 00:33:28
I'm glad you got whatever
it was wamp or --

693
00:33:28 --> 00:33:30
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

694
00:33:30 --> 00:33:34
PROFESSOR: The worst thing
about this you realize is that

695
00:33:34 --> 00:33:37
the stuff that you rehearsed
into long term memory may stay

696
00:33:37 --> 00:33:39
there for a surprisingly
long time.

697
00:33:39 --> 00:33:42
I had a guy come up to me on
the subway some years back.

698
00:33:42 --> 00:33:45
Say to me, you don't
know me right?

699
00:33:45 --> 00:33:48
I said that's right
I don't know you.

700
00:33:48 --> 00:33:50
He said fip, dut.
 

701
00:33:50 --> 00:33:53
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

702
00:33:53 --> 00:33:55
PROFESSOR: I said you are
a very strange person.

703
00:33:55 --> 00:33:59
But I now know where I know
you from, or don't you from

704
00:33:59 --> 00:34:04
or something like that.
 

705
00:34:04 --> 00:34:13
You may have now warped your
brain on ongoing basis.

706
00:34:13 --> 00:34:13
No.
 

707
00:34:13 --> 00:34:15
I don't want you to go up.
 

708
00:34:15 --> 00:34:16
Get back here.
 

709
00:34:16 --> 00:34:16
Stop.
 

710
00:34:16 --> 00:34:17
Come back down.
 

711
00:34:17 --> 00:34:19
You go up.
 

712
00:34:19 --> 00:34:19
All right.
 

713
00:34:19 --> 00:34:25
So back on the first page of
the handout, you have what was

714
00:34:25 --> 00:34:28
sometimes called a standard
model for getting from the

715
00:34:28 --> 00:34:32
outside world -- whoops my
bottleneck disappeared again

716
00:34:32 --> 00:34:35
-- into long term memory.
 

717
00:34:35 --> 00:34:41
Which was stuff comes into
a short term memory.

718
00:34:41 --> 00:34:43
It needs to be preserved
in short term memory by

719
00:34:43 --> 00:34:45
something like rehearsal.
 

720
00:34:45 --> 00:34:48
If it lasts long enough in
short term memory, it gets

721
00:34:48 --> 00:34:54
into long term memory
where it manages to stay.

722
00:34:54 --> 00:34:58
There are certain problems with
this kind of a model, which you

723
00:34:58 --> 00:35:00
ought to be able to
anticipate now.

724
00:35:00 --> 00:35:02
But we can illustrate
easily enough.

725
00:35:02 --> 00:35:06
How many people here
had breakfast?

726
00:35:06 --> 00:35:06
OK.
 

727
00:35:06 --> 00:35:09
Person with the MIT
shirt on there.

728
00:35:09 --> 00:35:10
What did you have
for breakfast?

729
00:35:10 --> 00:35:11
AUDIENCE: Bagel.
 

730
00:35:11 --> 00:35:12
PROFESSOR: Bagels.
 

731
00:35:12 --> 00:35:12
Anything else?
 

732
00:35:12 --> 00:35:14
AUDIENCE: Bagel
and cream cheese.

733
00:35:14 --> 00:35:15
PROFESSOR: Bagels
and cream cheese.

734
00:35:15 --> 00:35:15
Oh OK.
 

735
00:35:15 --> 00:35:15
That's good.
 

736
00:35:15 --> 00:35:19
We want a little bit of
a memory load here.

737
00:35:19 --> 00:35:21
Because I need to be able to
explain that the reason that

738
00:35:21 --> 00:35:24
she knows that she had bagels
and cream cheese for breakfast

739
00:35:24 --> 00:35:29
is that on the way out of her
living arrangements, she was

740
00:35:29 --> 00:35:31
going bagels and cream cheese,
bagels and cream cheese,

741
00:35:31 --> 00:35:32
Bagel and cream cheese.
 

742
00:35:32 --> 00:35:33
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

743
00:35:33 --> 00:35:34
PROFESSOR: Right?
 

744
00:35:34 --> 00:35:35
OK.
 

745
00:35:35 --> 00:35:37
That's good.
 

746
00:35:37 --> 00:35:38
No.
 

747
00:35:38 --> 00:35:38
She wasn't doing that.
 

748
00:35:38 --> 00:35:40
You weren't doing that,
but you remember what you

749
00:35:40 --> 00:35:44
had for breakfast too.
 

750
00:35:44 --> 00:35:48
Obviously this rehearsal thing
while it's important for

751
00:35:48 --> 00:35:52
getting nonsense from the world
into long term memory, is

752
00:35:52 --> 00:35:56
not the only way to get
through this bottleneck.

753
00:35:56 --> 00:36:01
Again things with meaning
manage to get there

754
00:36:01 --> 00:36:02
more readily.
 

755
00:36:02 --> 00:36:13
And we can see that that fact
tells us something perhaps

756
00:36:13 --> 00:36:19
about the way that our long
term memory is put together.

757
00:36:19 --> 00:36:21
Now here what we're talking
about is what's know as

758
00:36:21 --> 00:36:24
explicit long term memories
as distinct from implicit.

759
00:36:24 --> 00:36:27
Explicit long term memory are
the memories that you can get

760
00:36:27 --> 00:36:29
to if I ask you about them.
 

761
00:36:29 --> 00:36:32
That you can recover.
 

762
00:36:32 --> 00:36:35
So if I say, you know, who's
running for President, you have

763
00:36:35 --> 00:36:37
an explicit memory that the
answer is Kerry/Bush and

764
00:36:37 --> 00:36:42
whoever else you can name
down the line there.

765
00:36:42 --> 00:36:50
If I asked you how do you say
the word president, what are

766
00:36:50 --> 00:36:53
the tongue motions
that are required.

767
00:36:53 --> 00:36:56
If you say president, you can
now monitor it and figure

768
00:36:56 --> 00:36:56
out what they are.
 

769
00:36:56 --> 00:37:01
But you have no notion ahead
of time of how you do that.

770
00:37:01 --> 00:37:03
You certainly remember how to
do it in the sense that you

771
00:37:03 --> 00:37:05
can produce it on demand.
 

772
00:37:05 --> 00:37:06
That would be an
implicit memory.

773
00:37:06 --> 00:37:09
And how you ride a bicycle.
 

774
00:37:09 --> 00:37:12
There are a whole slew of
things like motor memories

775
00:37:12 --> 00:37:13
that are implicit.
 

776
00:37:13 --> 00:37:15
But here what we're talking
about is getting into an

777
00:37:15 --> 00:37:17
explicit long term memory.
 

778
00:37:17 --> 00:37:24
It's useful to divide explicit
long term memory into episodic

779
00:37:24 --> 00:37:33
memories for the episodes of
your life, and semantic

780
00:37:33 --> 00:37:37
memories, your body of
knowledge and facts and

781
00:37:37 --> 00:37:38
things of that sort.
 

782
00:37:38 --> 00:37:41
There not like walled
off from each other.

783
00:37:41 --> 00:37:49
If I say, what's the capital
of the United States, you dig

784
00:37:49 --> 00:37:52
out of your semantic memory
the answer Washington DC.

785
00:37:52 --> 00:37:55
If you've been to Washington,
you might then start digging

786
00:37:55 --> 00:37:59
out associated episodic
memories of being

787
00:37:59 --> 00:38:02
there and so on.
 

788
00:38:02 --> 00:38:07
But within semantic memory, the
notion here -- remember the

789
00:38:07 --> 00:38:11
Uncle Charlie or whoever he was
notion, that things can reach

790
00:38:11 --> 00:38:18
out to the world and help pull
things into long term memory --

791
00:38:18 --> 00:38:23
is related to the way that we
think that your long term up

792
00:38:23 --> 00:38:25
memory might be organized.
 

793
00:38:25 --> 00:38:28
And one of the popular ways of
thinking about this is sort of

794
00:38:28 --> 00:38:34
a giant network of associations
called a semantic

795
00:38:34 --> 00:38:35
network often.
 

796
00:38:35 --> 00:38:39
 
 

797
00:38:39 --> 00:38:43
If I say cat, the first word
that comes to your mind is?

798
00:38:43 --> 00:38:44
AUDIENCE: Meow.
 

799
00:38:44 --> 00:38:44
PROFESSOR: Meow.
 

800
00:38:44 --> 00:38:45
AUDIENCE: Dog.
 

801
00:38:45 --> 00:38:46
PROFESSOR: Dog.
 

802
00:38:46 --> 00:38:47
AUDIENCE: Mouse.
 

803
00:38:47 --> 00:38:47
PROFESSOR: OK.
 

804
00:38:47 --> 00:38:53
So there's a note in your long
term memory that is cat in

805
00:38:53 --> 00:38:56
some sense in this story.
 

806
00:38:56 --> 00:39:07
It's close neighbors are things
like dog and meow and --

807
00:39:07 --> 00:39:10
what did we have -- mouse.
 

808
00:39:10 --> 00:39:12
And now it's important to
realize this is not some sort

809
00:39:12 --> 00:39:16
of Linnaean taxonomy of, you
know, species and geneus and

810
00:39:16 --> 00:39:18
all that sort of good stuff.
 

811
00:39:18 --> 00:39:20
You know, even though it's
going to be connected with

812
00:39:20 --> 00:39:26
animal up here somewhere,
animal and fur and stuff.

813
00:39:26 --> 00:39:28
But you might also
have connections that

814
00:39:28 --> 00:39:32
go like meow, mow.
 

815
00:39:32 --> 00:39:37
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

816
00:39:37 --> 00:39:38
PROFESSOR: Actually
that goes back here.

817
00:39:38 --> 00:39:41
I actually have a cat whose
name is Chairman Mao by

818
00:39:41 --> 00:39:43
roughly this association.
 

819
00:39:43 --> 00:39:44
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

820
00:39:44 --> 00:39:47
PROFESSOR: You know,
then, you know, China.

821
00:39:47 --> 00:39:51
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

822
00:39:51 --> 00:39:53
PROFESSOR: Plates.
 

823
00:39:53 --> 00:39:54
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

824
00:39:54 --> 00:40:00
PROFESSOR: So, you know, nobody
has the notion that you could

825
00:40:00 --> 00:40:05
somehow map this out for
any given individual.

826
00:40:05 --> 00:40:08
It's going to be a vastly
complex and continuously

827
00:40:08 --> 00:40:12
changing set of associations.
 

828
00:40:12 --> 00:40:16
But there is evidence for
this notion of proximity

829
00:40:16 --> 00:40:18
by association.
 

830
00:40:18 --> 00:40:23
By meaning in long term memory.
 

831
00:40:23 --> 00:40:28
And one of the ways you might
find that out is by doing what

832
00:40:28 --> 00:40:32
are called priming experiments,
which I might as well mention

833
00:40:32 --> 00:40:36
because I see that's -- is
that on the handout properly.

834
00:40:36 --> 00:40:38
Well if it isn't, it should be.
 

835
00:40:38 --> 00:40:41
It probably says
priming somewhere.

836
00:40:41 --> 00:40:44
Priming experiment.
 

837
00:40:44 --> 00:40:45
Evidence from priming.
 

838
00:40:45 --> 00:40:46
Look at that.
 

839
00:40:46 --> 00:40:49
 
 

840
00:40:49 --> 00:40:57
On my computer screen here,
I'll put up a string of

841
00:40:57 --> 00:41:01
letters, and you tell me
whether or not it's a word.

842
00:41:01 --> 00:41:01
Right?
 

843
00:41:01 --> 00:41:04
So I put up.
 

844
00:41:04 --> 00:41:05
And you say?
 

845
00:41:05 --> 00:41:06
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

846
00:41:06 --> 00:41:07
PROFESSOR: No.
 

847
00:41:07 --> 00:41:10
Even though it's now in your
long term memory right.

848
00:41:10 --> 00:41:11
But if I put up.
 

849
00:41:11 --> 00:41:15
 
 

850
00:41:15 --> 00:41:16
Yes.
 

851
00:41:16 --> 00:41:17
OK now.
 

852
00:41:17 --> 00:41:27
If the next word was something
like truck, unless you have a

853
00:41:27 --> 00:41:29
dog in your truck or
something like that.

854
00:41:29 --> 00:41:33
 
 

855
00:41:33 --> 00:41:36
Well all right,
let's compare this.

856
00:41:36 --> 00:41:40
The next word might be truck,
or the next word might be cat.

857
00:41:40 --> 00:41:42
You'll be faster to say cat.
 

858
00:41:42 --> 00:41:44
You'll be faster to confirm
that cat is a word

859
00:41:44 --> 00:41:46
than truck is a word.
 

860
00:41:46 --> 00:41:48
Why is that?
 

861
00:41:48 --> 00:41:52
Well seemingly when you go in
to your semantic network to

862
00:41:52 --> 00:42:01
discover that dog is a word,
you light up the dog node, and

863
00:42:01 --> 00:42:05
the activities spreads -- it's
called spreading activation --

864
00:42:05 --> 00:42:10
away from that node to
the neighboring nodes.

865
00:42:10 --> 00:42:15
As a result, when you get
the word cat, cat's already

866
00:42:15 --> 00:42:17
a little activated.
 

867
00:42:17 --> 00:42:19
The bell's been rung a
little bit already.

868
00:42:19 --> 00:42:23
And your quicker to confirm
that cat is a word than truck.

869
00:42:23 --> 00:42:27
Which is you know, down
here in, you know, in the

870
00:42:27 --> 00:42:29
next county somewhere.
 

871
00:42:29 --> 00:42:33
 
 

872
00:42:33 --> 00:42:36
In principle I suppose you
could map out somebody's

873
00:42:36 --> 00:42:39
semantic network with a
technique like this.

874
00:42:39 --> 00:42:42
But it would be a lifetime's
endeavor ever, and not

875
00:42:42 --> 00:42:43
clear what the point is.
 

876
00:42:43 --> 00:42:47
But you could you can use this
sort of a technique to show

877
00:42:47 --> 00:42:50
that some things live closer to
each other than other things.

878
00:42:50 --> 00:42:55
Oh and by the way, when you go
and reach in to retrieve --

879
00:42:55 --> 00:42:56
this is sort of jumping to the
retrieval part -- but when

880
00:42:56 --> 00:43:04
you go reach in to retrieve
something from one node, you

881
00:43:04 --> 00:43:07
might goof and pull something
from the neighboring node.

882
00:43:07 --> 00:43:11
And you know this, or you have
experienced this if you are not

883
00:43:11 --> 00:43:13
an only child perhaps,
even if you are.

884
00:43:13 --> 00:43:15
How many do you have siblings?
 

885
00:43:15 --> 00:43:16
Keep your hands up.
 

886
00:43:16 --> 00:43:19
How many of those have ever
had your parents call you

887
00:43:19 --> 00:43:21
by the sibling's name?
 

888
00:43:21 --> 00:43:22
Almost everybody.
 

889
00:43:22 --> 00:43:23
Including some people
who didn't have their

890
00:43:23 --> 00:43:24
hands up before.
 

891
00:43:24 --> 00:43:24
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

892
00:43:24 --> 00:43:27
PROFESSOR: Who didn't know
that they had siblings

893
00:43:27 --> 00:43:30
until that happened.
 

894
00:43:30 --> 00:43:32
Or worse, you know, you get
called by the name of the

895
00:43:32 --> 00:43:35
dog or something like that.
 

896
00:43:35 --> 00:43:39
This is not because whatever
you may believe, you know,

897
00:43:39 --> 00:43:42
that your parents are
unusually dim people.

898
00:43:42 --> 00:43:48
It's because all those terms
presumably live very close to

899
00:43:48 --> 00:43:50
each in this semantic memory.
 

900
00:43:50 --> 00:43:53
And when particularly under
some pressure you reach into

901
00:43:53 --> 00:43:56
grab kid number -- all my
kids have the same name.

902
00:43:56 --> 00:44:01
Their name is Ben Phillip
Simon, whatever your name is.

903
00:44:01 --> 00:44:06
And it works for all of them.
 

904
00:44:06 --> 00:44:08
Now there are certain
drawbacks to this.

905
00:44:08 --> 00:44:13
It turns out to be decidedly
unfortunate if in a moment of

906
00:44:13 --> 00:44:17
passion you murmur the name
of the last girlfriend.

907
00:44:17 --> 00:44:17
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

908
00:44:17 --> 00:44:19
PROFESSOR: No matter
how close they live in

909
00:44:19 --> 00:44:21
your semantic network.
 

910
00:44:21 --> 00:44:24
 
 

911
00:44:24 --> 00:44:28
We can explain it, but we can't
excuse it if you know what I.

912
00:44:28 --> 00:44:31
 
 

913
00:44:31 --> 00:44:38
So big world, small desktop,
small working memory,

914
00:44:38 --> 00:44:41
big long term memory.
 

915
00:44:41 --> 00:44:44
 
 

916
00:44:44 --> 00:44:48
What's going on when the stuff
in long term memory gets turned

917
00:44:48 --> 00:44:51
into something long term?
 

918
00:44:51 --> 00:44:56
It's really there for
a long, long time.

919
00:44:56 --> 00:45:01
If you get a chance, David
Pillemer's article that's in

920
00:45:01 --> 00:45:05
the website under the memory
category about very long term

921
00:45:05 --> 00:45:10
memories, is fun to read as he
goes and probes people's oldest

922
00:45:10 --> 00:45:15
memories from way, way back.
 

923
00:45:15 --> 00:45:17
How does stuff get
consolidated.

924
00:45:17 --> 00:45:19
Well we know some
things about this.

925
00:45:19 --> 00:45:20
We know quite a lot about this.
 

926
00:45:20 --> 00:45:24
But I want to tell you one bit,
a couple of bits, that are

927
00:45:24 --> 00:45:27
important on a sort of
a physiological front.

928
00:45:27 --> 00:45:30
So here's the brain again.
 

929
00:45:30 --> 00:45:32
Underneath the temporal lobe,
not in the cortex of the

930
00:45:32 --> 00:45:40
temporal lobe, but underneath
the temporal lobe struc the

931
00:45:40 --> 00:45:46
hippocampus, and to a lesser
extent the amygdala.

932
00:45:46 --> 00:45:48
I'll just mention.
 

933
00:45:48 --> 00:45:51
But really we're talking
about hippocampus here.

934
00:45:51 --> 00:45:55
Parts of the so called Limbic
System that are vitally

935
00:45:55 --> 00:45:58
important in this process
of consolidation.

936
00:45:58 --> 00:46:05
And we know that in the first
instance from perhaps the

937
00:46:05 --> 00:46:10
most famous patient in the
neuropsychological literature.

938
00:46:10 --> 00:46:15
He's a patient known in
the literature as HM.

939
00:46:15 --> 00:46:18
He's the inspiration for
the film Memento if

940
00:46:18 --> 00:46:18
you saw Memento.
 

941
00:46:18 --> 00:46:21
 
 

942
00:46:21 --> 00:46:28
When he was a young man he had
a bike accident that was

943
00:46:28 --> 00:46:33
probably the cause
of his epilepsy.

944
00:46:33 --> 00:46:36
So he was an epileptic.
 

945
00:46:36 --> 00:46:39
You may recall I said earlier
in the course that epilepsy is

946
00:46:39 --> 00:46:43
a sort of an electrical storm
often started from a damaged

947
00:46:43 --> 00:46:46
piece of tissue in the brain.
 

948
00:46:46 --> 00:46:49
If it's not responding to
drugs, which this was not, one

949
00:46:49 --> 00:46:53
of the treatment is to go and
try to excise, to take

950
00:46:53 --> 00:46:55
out, the generator.
 

951
00:46:55 --> 00:47:02
The evidence in HM's case
pointed to structures deep

952
00:47:02 --> 00:47:03
in the temporal lobe.
 

953
00:47:03 --> 00:47:06
Particularly the
hippocampus and amygdala.

954
00:47:06 --> 00:47:12
And what was done in the late
50's, in the late 50's or

955
00:47:12 --> 00:47:14
early 60's, anybody remember?
 

956
00:47:14 --> 00:47:20
Anyway a long time ago, at this
point, up in Montreal was that

957
00:47:20 --> 00:47:23
these structures were
largely destroyed on

958
00:47:23 --> 00:47:25
both sides of his brain.
 

959
00:47:25 --> 00:47:25
That's important.
 

960
00:47:25 --> 00:47:29
This is a bilateral lesion.
 

961
00:47:29 --> 00:47:33
And this did have the effect
of largely controlling

962
00:47:33 --> 00:47:34
his seizures.
 

963
00:47:34 --> 00:47:36
The seizure problem went away.
 

964
00:47:36 --> 00:47:42
However, he's a one of a kind
patient, because the side

965
00:47:42 --> 00:47:46
effects, the unintentional
consequences of this lesion,

966
00:47:46 --> 00:47:50
was so devastating that
nobody could ethically

967
00:47:50 --> 00:47:52
ever do this again.
 

968
00:47:52 --> 00:47:56
At least not to a
human patient.

969
00:47:56 --> 00:47:59
 
 

970
00:47:59 --> 00:48:03
So he's still alive.
 

971
00:48:03 --> 00:48:06
And in fact, he's in a nursing
facility near Boston.

972
00:48:06 --> 00:48:12
Because he was brought to
Boston essentially as a

973
00:48:12 --> 00:48:15
psychological subject.
 

974
00:48:15 --> 00:48:17
Been unable to live on his
own since the surgery.

975
00:48:17 --> 00:48:18
What's his problem?
 

976
00:48:18 --> 00:48:19
Well, he really has two.
 

977
00:48:19 --> 00:48:25
But the most relevant one for
the present purposes is that he

978
00:48:25 --> 00:48:31
is simply unable to form new
explicit long term memories.

979
00:48:31 --> 00:48:35
 
 

980
00:48:35 --> 00:48:41
Take his interaction with a
once upon a time TA in this

981
00:48:41 --> 00:48:44
course name John Gabrieli now
a Professor at Stanford soon

982
00:48:44 --> 00:48:47
to be a Professor
back here at MIT.

983
00:48:47 --> 00:48:50
But who did, I think he did
his doctral work studying HM.

984
00:48:50 --> 00:48:52
But he certainly studied
HM as a graduate student.

985
00:48:52 --> 00:48:59
He'd come into the
lab to meet HM.

986
00:48:59 --> 00:49:01
Say hi, you know, have
we've met before.

987
00:49:01 --> 00:49:02
HM said no.
 

988
00:49:02 --> 00:49:03
I don't think so.
 

989
00:49:03 --> 00:49:06
He's perfectly intact short
term memory, which is fine for

990
00:49:06 --> 00:49:08
conducting a conversation.
 

991
00:49:08 --> 00:49:14
Also decently intact memories,
this long term memory from

992
00:49:14 --> 00:49:16
before the operation.
 

993
00:49:16 --> 00:49:19
So it's not that we've
somehow wiped out his

994
00:49:19 --> 00:49:20
storehouse of memories.
 

995
00:49:20 --> 00:49:23
It's the ability to put new
stuff in here that's gone.

996
00:49:23 --> 00:49:25
So in comes Gabrieli.
 

997
00:49:25 --> 00:49:26
Have we ever met before?
 

998
00:49:26 --> 00:49:26
No.
 

999
00:49:26 --> 00:49:31
Hi I'm John Gabrieli, you
know, it's nice to meet you.

1000
00:49:31 --> 00:49:32
I'm HM, well I suppose
he didn't call himself

1001
00:49:32 --> 00:49:34
HM, but anyway.
 

1002
00:49:34 --> 00:49:38
You use initials to protect
the privacy of the patient.

1003
00:49:38 --> 00:49:40
Not necessarily the
initials of the patient.

1004
00:49:40 --> 00:49:42
Something to label them.
 

1005
00:49:42 --> 00:49:45
So anyway, fine have
a nice conversation.

1006
00:49:45 --> 00:49:46
Gabrieli goes out.
 

1007
00:49:46 --> 00:49:47
Comes back in.
 

1008
00:49:47 --> 00:49:49
Says hi, have we
ever met before.

1009
00:49:49 --> 00:49:50
No I don't think so.
 

1010
00:49:50 --> 00:49:51
Well hi.
 

1011
00:49:51 --> 00:49:52
I'm John Gabrieli nice to meet.
 

1012
00:49:52 --> 00:49:54
Have the same conversation.
 

1013
00:49:54 --> 00:49:56
You can do this over
and over again.

1014
00:49:56 --> 00:50:00
 
 

1015
00:50:00 --> 00:50:03
In a more control kind
of way, do a digit span

1016
00:50:03 --> 00:50:04
kind of experiment.
 

1017
00:50:04 --> 00:50:06
Give him a few
digits to remember.

1018
00:50:06 --> 00:50:07
No problem.
 

1019
00:50:07 --> 00:50:09
He's got the same 7 plus
or minus 2 that the rest

1020
00:50:09 --> 00:50:12
of us have pretty much.
 

1021
00:50:12 --> 00:50:15
Distract him momentarily,
and it's just gone.

1022
00:50:15 --> 00:50:17
You've had this experience
yourself if you try to get

1023
00:50:17 --> 00:50:21
from the phone book to the
phone with a phone number.

1024
00:50:21 --> 00:50:24
And somebody says, didd
you do x, y and z?

1025
00:50:24 --> 00:50:25
Ahh.
 

1026
00:50:25 --> 00:50:27
There goes the phone number.
 

1027
00:50:27 --> 00:50:27
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

1028
00:50:27 --> 00:50:28
PROFESSOR:
 

1029
00:50:28 --> 00:50:32
That's his continuous
experience, and has been for

1030
00:50:32 --> 00:50:34
50 years at this point.
 

1031
00:50:34 --> 00:50:36
A few things have gotten in.
 

1032
00:50:36 --> 00:50:38
He happens to know that
men have landed on the

1033
00:50:38 --> 00:50:41
moon for instance.
 

1034
00:50:41 --> 00:50:43
Perhaps because they're a
little bits of the structure

1035
00:50:43 --> 00:50:45
that are maintained perhaps
from another route.

1036
00:50:45 --> 00:50:47
We're not quite sure.
 

1037
00:50:47 --> 00:50:52
But basically no new
episodic memories.

1038
00:50:52 --> 00:50:57
What this is telling us is that
the hippocampus in particular,

1039
00:50:57 --> 00:51:00
other research indicates is
critical for the act

1040
00:51:00 --> 00:51:02
of consolidation.
 

1041
00:51:02 --> 00:51:04
It is not the memory itself.
 

1042
00:51:04 --> 00:51:10
It is the mechanism that allows
you to make those memories

1043
00:51:10 --> 00:51:11
solid in some fashion.
 

1044
00:51:11 --> 00:51:11
Yes?
 

1045
00:51:11 --> 00:51:14
AUDIENCE: But, does he know
he has this disorder?

1046
00:51:14 --> 00:51:18
PROFESSOR: He knows he's
got a memory problem.

1047
00:51:18 --> 00:51:19
And this actually
is a good point.

1048
00:51:19 --> 00:51:23
He ties into his other problem,
which is in some sense

1049
00:51:23 --> 00:51:25
an off setting benefits.
 

1050
00:51:25 --> 00:51:30
The Limbic System, certainly
the amygdala, very important

1051
00:51:30 --> 00:51:32
in the mediation of emotion.
 

1052
00:51:32 --> 00:51:34
His experience of emotion
is greatly flattened.

1053
00:51:34 --> 00:51:38
Flattened affect in the
jargon of the trade.

1054
00:51:38 --> 00:51:40
So.
 

1055
00:51:40 --> 00:51:40
Which is good.
 

1056
00:51:40 --> 00:51:42
Because he does know that
there's something wrong, but it

1057
00:51:42 --> 00:51:44
doesn't bother him that much.
 

1058
00:51:44 --> 00:51:46
You know what bothers him?
 

1059
00:51:46 --> 00:51:50
What bothers him is
looking in the mirror.

1060
00:51:50 --> 00:51:52
Now why should that be?
 

1061
00:51:52 --> 00:51:53
Well imagine this.
 

1062
00:51:53 --> 00:51:57
His lesion happened
when he's in his 20s.

1063
00:51:57 --> 00:52:00
He's still got the long
term memories that

1064
00:52:00 --> 00:52:02
he had in his 20s.
 

1065
00:52:02 --> 00:52:03
Basically your age.
 

1066
00:52:03 --> 00:52:07
Now you go back to your room,
you look in the mirror, and

1067
00:52:07 --> 00:52:11
what looks out at you is a 70
year old guy or women

1068
00:52:11 --> 00:52:12
as the case may
 

1069
00:52:12 --> 00:52:12
be.
 

1070
00:52:12 --> 00:52:14
I suppose it doesn't
particularly matter.

1071
00:52:14 --> 00:52:16
It's going to be a
disaster under either

1072
00:52:16 --> 00:52:17
circumstance right?
 

1073
00:52:17 --> 00:52:21
You're going to think I'm
in a sci-fi movie, and

1074
00:52:21 --> 00:52:23
I don't have the part.
 

1075
00:52:23 --> 00:52:26
You know the good guy
with the laser gun part

1076
00:52:26 --> 00:52:27
that I really wanted.
 

1077
00:52:27 --> 00:52:30
You know I'm in
big trouble here.

1078
00:52:30 --> 00:52:35
And this is disturbing to him.
 

1079
00:52:35 --> 00:52:37
Not as disturbing as it would
be to you again, because his

1080
00:52:37 --> 00:52:40
emotional responses has been
very severely blunted.

1081
00:52:40 --> 00:52:46
So much so that he needs to be
asked whether or not he's sick.

1082
00:52:46 --> 00:52:48
You know do you have
a stomach ache?

1083
00:52:48 --> 00:52:50
No that you mentioned
it, yes I do.

1084
00:52:50 --> 00:52:52
It's not that he couldn't feel
the pain, it's just without the

1085
00:52:52 --> 00:52:56
emotional overlay so, you know.
 

1086
00:52:56 --> 00:52:57
I see blue.
 

1087
00:52:57 --> 00:52:58
I have pain what's
the big deal?

1088
00:52:58 --> 00:52:58
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

1089
00:52:58 --> 00:52:59
PROFESSOR: Yes?
 

1090
00:52:59 --> 00:53:00
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

1091
00:53:00 --> 00:53:01
motor memory
 

1092
00:53:01 --> 00:53:03
PROFESSOR: Yes.
 

1093
00:53:03 --> 00:53:05
Nice point.
 

1094
00:53:05 --> 00:53:09
So for example, I don't know
how many of you have hung out

1095
00:53:09 --> 00:53:14
at -- you know get rid
of the brain here.

1096
00:53:14 --> 00:53:16
Who needs the brain?
 

1097
00:53:16 --> 00:53:21
So any you ever done
a mirror maze?

1098
00:53:21 --> 00:53:22
Some people may have
actually built one of

1099
00:53:22 --> 00:53:23
these once upon a time.
 

1100
00:53:23 --> 00:53:26
So imagine you
have like a star.

1101
00:53:26 --> 00:53:26
Oops.
 

1102
00:53:26 --> 00:53:29
Imagine you could
actually draw a star.

1103
00:53:29 --> 00:53:32
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

1104
00:53:32 --> 00:53:33
PROFESSOR: All right.
 

1105
00:53:33 --> 00:53:33
Well.
 

1106
00:53:33 --> 00:53:36
 
 

1107
00:53:36 --> 00:53:39
So you make this out of like
aluminum foil, and you go and

1108
00:53:39 --> 00:53:40
trace it with a metal stylus.
 

1109
00:53:40 --> 00:53:44
And if you go off the aluminum
foil it makes a nasty noise.

1110
00:53:44 --> 00:53:47
Because you're breaking a
circuit or something like that.

1111
00:53:47 --> 00:53:49
Anybody ever build
one of those?

1112
00:53:49 --> 00:53:51
Oh what's the world coming to.
 

1113
00:53:51 --> 00:53:52
It's easy right?
 

1114
00:53:52 --> 00:53:53
Anybody can do this.
 

1115
00:53:53 --> 00:53:58
What people can't do regular
readily is do this looking

1116
00:53:58 --> 00:54:01
at the image in a mirror.
 

1117
00:54:01 --> 00:54:01
Right?
 

1118
00:54:01 --> 00:54:05
Because then think they
got [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1119
00:54:05 --> 00:54:07
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

1120
00:54:07 --> 00:54:10
PROFESSOR: But you
learn to do this.

1121
00:54:10 --> 00:54:14
And HM has been trained in one
set of experiments to do this.

1122
00:54:14 --> 00:54:18
In multiple sessions
he got better.

1123
00:54:18 --> 00:54:20
If you asked him have you
ever done this before on the

1124
00:54:20 --> 00:54:22
nth time that he did it.
 

1125
00:54:22 --> 00:54:23
The answer is no.
 

1126
00:54:23 --> 00:54:25
I don't think so.
 

1127
00:54:25 --> 00:54:27
And he goes [UNINTELLIGIBLE].
 

1128
00:54:27 --> 00:54:29
Hey, you know, that
was really good.

1129
00:54:29 --> 00:54:31
Most people asked how
did you do that?

1130
00:54:31 --> 00:54:32
Yeah.
 

1131
00:54:32 --> 00:54:33
I've always been good
at that kind of thing.

1132
00:54:33 --> 00:54:35
Or, you know, just lucky.
 

1133
00:54:35 --> 00:54:40
No episodic memory, no explicit
memory of ever having done it.

1134
00:54:40 --> 00:54:43
But yes a motor memory that
allows them to do it.

1135
00:54:43 --> 00:54:50
Similarly, your sense
of familiarity runs on

1136
00:54:50 --> 00:54:51
different pathways.
 

1137
00:54:51 --> 00:54:56
So if I bumped into you
wandering around the halls, I

1138
00:54:56 --> 00:55:01
may well have the sense that
I've seen you somewhere before.

1139
00:55:01 --> 00:55:08
And I might guess that that's,
you know, I've seen you in

1140
00:55:08 --> 00:55:10
intro psych, because that's
where I see a lot of people

1141
00:55:10 --> 00:55:13
whose names I don't really
quite know and stuff like that.

1142
00:55:13 --> 00:55:14
So that would work.
 

1143
00:55:14 --> 00:55:17
And HM gets that sense
of familiarity too.

1144
00:55:17 --> 00:55:23
So after a while actually with
Gabrieli, Gabrieli comes in,

1145
00:55:23 --> 00:55:24
have we ever met before?
 

1146
00:55:24 --> 00:55:24
Yeah.
 

1147
00:55:24 --> 00:55:25
You looks familiar.
 

1148
00:55:25 --> 00:55:26
Do you know my name?
 

1149
00:55:26 --> 00:55:26
Know you're name?
 

1150
00:55:26 --> 00:55:28
Forgotten your name.
 

1151
00:55:28 --> 00:55:29
Who do you think I am?
 

1152
00:55:29 --> 00:55:31
I think you're probably
somebody from my

1153
00:55:31 --> 00:55:33
high school class.
 

1154
00:55:33 --> 00:55:34
Now why would that be.
 

1155
00:55:34 --> 00:55:36
Well Gabrieli at the
time was a young 20

1156
00:55:36 --> 00:55:37
something year old guy.
 

1157
00:55:37 --> 00:55:42
This guy's got a 20 something
year old long term memory.

1158
00:55:42 --> 00:55:44
A reasonable guess of somebody
who looks more or less

1159
00:55:44 --> 00:55:48
familiar, but isn't in my
current collection of

1160
00:55:48 --> 00:55:49
people I know well.
 

1161
00:55:49 --> 00:55:52
It's yeah maybe from high
school, or something like that.

1162
00:55:52 --> 00:55:58
We're about the same age as
the 70 year old HM to the 20

1163
00:55:58 --> 00:56:01
something year old Gabrieli.
 

1164
00:56:01 --> 00:56:04
So those sort of
things he does learn.

1165
00:56:04 --> 00:56:09
It's that new explicit long
term memories that require the

1166
00:56:09 --> 00:56:14
hippocampus to be consolidated.
 

1167
00:56:14 --> 00:56:15
How long does this take?
 

1168
00:56:15 --> 00:56:16
Let me say a quick word
about that, and then

1169
00:56:16 --> 00:56:20
we'll take a quick break.
 

1170
00:56:20 --> 00:56:24
You can measure the time course
of consolidation by doing an

1171
00:56:24 --> 00:56:28
experiment of the
following sort.

1172
00:56:28 --> 00:56:31
You can draw bad rats.
 

1173
00:56:31 --> 00:56:34
 
 

1174
00:56:34 --> 00:56:36
OK there's a rat.
 

1175
00:56:36 --> 00:56:37
He's on a little pedestal.
 

1176
00:56:37 --> 00:56:43
If you were a rat on a small
pedestal not too far above

1177
00:56:43 --> 00:56:46
the floor, what are
you going to do?

1178
00:56:46 --> 00:56:48
AUDIENCE: Jump off.
 

1179
00:56:48 --> 00:56:49
PROFESSOR: Jump off, right.
 

1180
00:56:49 --> 00:56:49
I'm a rat.
 

1181
00:56:49 --> 00:56:51
Man I got to go look
around at stuff.

1182
00:56:51 --> 00:56:54
So I jump off.
 

1183
00:56:54 --> 00:56:58
Well what they didn't tell me
back at home was that this

1184
00:56:58 --> 00:57:01
particular floor
is electrified.

1185
00:57:01 --> 00:57:06
So when I jump off my little
toes get an unpleasant,

1186
00:57:06 --> 00:57:08
not damaging, but an
unpleasant shock.

1187
00:57:08 --> 00:57:12
So now the guy puts
me back on here.

1188
00:57:12 --> 00:57:12
What do I do?
 

1189
00:57:12 --> 00:57:14
AUDIENCE: Jump off.
 

1190
00:57:14 --> 00:57:15
PROFESSOR: I don't jump off.
 

1191
00:57:15 --> 00:57:16
I'm not a stupid rat.
 

1192
00:57:16 --> 00:57:17
I'm just a rat.
 

1193
00:57:17 --> 00:57:19
And so I stay there.
 

1194
00:57:19 --> 00:57:21
OK, well.
 

1195
00:57:21 --> 00:57:26
I'm a rat who's in
an experiment.

1196
00:57:26 --> 00:57:29
And the question is
what percentage of the

1197
00:57:29 --> 00:57:37
time do I jump off?
 

1198
00:57:37 --> 00:57:41
 
 

1199
00:57:41 --> 00:57:48
And the variable here is after
I jump off, and after I get my

1200
00:57:48 --> 00:57:52
toes shocked, I'm also going to
get a dose of what's called

1201
00:57:52 --> 00:57:55
electroconvulsive shock.
 

1202
00:57:55 --> 00:57:59
Which is basically electrical
current run through the brain.

1203
00:57:59 --> 00:58:03
You know you can kill people
or animals that way.

1204
00:58:03 --> 00:58:05
Obviously that's not
the point here.

1205
00:58:05 --> 00:58:08
This is to disrupt the
on going electrical

1206
00:58:08 --> 00:58:10
activity of the brain.
 

1207
00:58:10 --> 00:58:12
Not to scramble the structure.
 

1208
00:58:12 --> 00:58:14
Not to cook proteins.
 

1209
00:58:14 --> 00:58:20
But just to disrupt any
ongoing electrical activity.

1210
00:58:20 --> 00:58:24
So this is the delay to ECS.
 

1211
00:58:24 --> 00:58:26
 
 

1212
00:58:26 --> 00:58:30
Rat steps down when
does he get his ECS?

1213
00:58:30 --> 00:58:37
If he gets the ECS immediately,
put him back on the platform.

1214
00:58:37 --> 00:58:39
Basically a 100% of the time
the rat will step down

1215
00:58:39 --> 00:58:40
the next time to.
 

1216
00:58:40 --> 00:58:41
Why?
 

1217
00:58:41 --> 00:58:45
Not because the ECS is like
fun or something like that.

1218
00:58:45 --> 00:58:49
But because the ECS has
wiped out the memory.

1219
00:58:49 --> 00:58:53
The memory is not consolidated
and the rat simply doesn't know

1220
00:58:53 --> 00:58:55
that his little feet got fried.
 

1221
00:58:55 --> 00:58:58
And he steps down again.
 

1222
00:58:58 --> 00:59:02
As the delay gets longer, you
get an essentially exponential

1223
00:59:02 --> 00:59:09
looking curve with a time
course in this case of seconds

1224
00:59:09 --> 00:59:13
that represents the time of
consolidation of that memory.

1225
00:59:13 --> 00:59:16
At least to the point of
supporting the behavior

1226
00:59:16 --> 00:59:18
of not stepping down.
 

1227
00:59:18 --> 00:59:22
but it's probably better to
think it's not the case that

1228
00:59:22 --> 00:59:25
all memories consolidate
within seconds.

1229
00:59:25 --> 00:59:29
There's evidence
from human studies.

1230
00:59:29 --> 00:59:31
Now why would you do
human electroconvulsive

1231
00:59:31 --> 00:59:33
shock studies?
 

1232
00:59:33 --> 00:59:37
The reason is that
electroconvulsive shock in

1233
00:59:37 --> 00:59:42
humans is electroconvulsive
therapy.

1234
00:59:42 --> 00:59:45
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

1235
00:59:45 --> 00:59:47
PROFESSOR: It sounds very odd.
 

1236
00:59:47 --> 00:59:47
It sounds very odd.
 

1237
00:59:47 --> 00:59:51
And those of you who've seen
the now quite old movie to

1238
00:59:51 --> 00:59:53
kill, Not To Kill A
Mockingbird, One Flew

1239
00:59:53 --> 00:59:54
Over The Cuckoo's Nest.
 

1240
00:59:54 --> 00:59:56
One of those bird movies.
 

1241
00:59:56 --> 01:00:00
One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest
probably have a dim view of

1242
01:00:00 --> 01:00:03
electroconvulsive therapy.
 

1243
01:00:03 --> 01:00:05
But that's badly earned.
 

1244
01:00:05 --> 01:00:09
Int he case of intractable
both depression.

1245
01:00:09 --> 01:00:14
Depression that's not being
broken up successfully by

1246
01:00:14 --> 01:00:18
medication or by psychotherapy.
 

1247
01:00:18 --> 01:00:22
Severe depression of that sort
carries with it a very serious

1248
01:00:22 --> 01:00:24
risk of mortality from suicide.
 

1249
01:00:24 --> 01:00:27
So this is not a, you
know, casual disorder.

1250
01:00:27 --> 01:00:31
It turns out that
electroconvulsive therapy is

1251
01:00:31 --> 01:00:37
often very effective in
breaking up such depressions.

1252
01:00:37 --> 01:00:42
And is actually is useful part
of the spectrum of treatments

1253
01:00:42 --> 01:00:47
that are available
in this case.

1254
01:00:47 --> 01:00:50
Like most medical treatment,
it's not entirely cost free.

1255
01:00:50 --> 01:00:55
It is the case that there
are memory consequences of

1256
01:00:55 --> 01:00:56
electroconvulsive therapy.
 

1257
01:00:56 --> 01:00:59
It's part of what actually
gives it a somewhat

1258
01:00:59 --> 01:01:01
bad reputation.
 

1259
01:01:01 --> 01:01:06
And you can actually see
those memory consequences.

1260
01:01:06 --> 01:01:08
You can see traces of
them going back years.

1261
01:01:08 --> 01:01:14
 
 

1262
01:01:14 --> 01:01:17
This is in studies for
instance of memory for

1263
01:01:17 --> 01:01:19
TV shows seen only once.
 

1264
01:01:19 --> 01:01:21
You know sort of thing that you
might dimly remember under

1265
01:01:21 --> 01:01:23
the best of circumstances.
 

1266
01:01:23 --> 01:01:27
These rather limited kind
of memories can be damaged

1267
01:01:27 --> 01:01:29
by a electroconvulsive
therapy years later.

1268
01:01:29 --> 01:01:34
As if this exponential
has a very long tail.

1269
01:01:34 --> 01:01:39
And when you want to call it
consolidated is perhaps a

1270
01:01:39 --> 01:01:41
function of may be something
like how important

1271
01:01:41 --> 01:01:42
the memory is.
 

1272
01:01:42 --> 01:01:47
If I do this again, I'm
going to be hurt right now.

1273
01:01:47 --> 01:01:50
That memory can be made solid
enough relatively quickly that

1274
01:01:50 --> 01:01:52
you don't go and do it again.
 

1275
01:01:52 --> 01:01:57
On the other hand, if the
memory is, was it Bridgette

1276
01:01:57 --> 01:02:02
Loves Bernie, or Benji.
 

1277
01:02:02 --> 01:02:04
All right that kind of good.
 

1278
01:02:04 --> 01:02:06
You know no stakes kind
of memory is apparently

1279
01:02:06 --> 01:02:08
still vulnerable.
 

1280
01:02:08 --> 01:02:10
At least still partially
vulnerable going back

1281
01:02:10 --> 01:02:11
for a very long time.
 

1282
01:02:11 --> 01:02:13
The hippocampus seems to be
behaving like something

1283
01:02:13 --> 01:02:15
like scaffolding.
 

1284
01:02:15 --> 01:02:19
It holds the bits of the memory
in place until it's firm

1285
01:02:19 --> 01:02:21
enough to stand on its own.
 

1286
01:02:21 --> 01:02:28
And then you can really call
it in the sense of sort

1287
01:02:28 --> 01:02:30
of a permanent memory.
 

1288
01:02:30 --> 01:02:34
Now that doesn't solve
the issue of getting

1289
01:02:34 --> 01:02:36
stuff out of memory.
 

1290
01:02:36 --> 01:02:41
And I will say a word or two
about that momentarily.

1291
01:02:41 --> 01:02:43
But first you can wipe out
your short term memory by

1292
01:02:43 --> 01:02:44
stretching for a second.
 

1293
01:02:44 --> 01:02:58
 
 

1294
01:02:58 --> 01:04:23
[SIDE___CONVERSA
TION___WITH___STUDENT]

1295
01:04:23 --> 01:04:23
OK.
 

1296
01:04:23 --> 01:04:28
 
 

1297
01:04:28 --> 01:04:32
Looking at the handout, let
me just make sure that I

1298
01:04:32 --> 01:04:35
explained the jargon here.
 

1299
01:04:35 --> 01:04:39
So a loss of memory as
everybody knows is an amnesia.

1300
01:04:39 --> 01:04:46
A loss of memory for events
prior to the point of injury

1301
01:04:46 --> 01:04:49
would be a retrograde amnesia.
 

1302
01:04:49 --> 01:04:52
That's not what HM has.
 

1303
01:04:52 --> 01:04:55
HM has an anterograde amnesia.
 

1304
01:04:55 --> 01:04:59
A problem with his memory
subsequent to the lesion,

1305
01:04:59 --> 01:05:03
subsequent to the injury.
 

1306
01:05:03 --> 01:05:08
We won't do this is a demo, but
if I were to take a baseball

1307
01:05:08 --> 01:05:11
bat and pop her on the head.
 

1308
01:05:11 --> 01:05:13
Well apart from the fact
that I probably wouldn't

1309
01:05:13 --> 01:05:15
be back on a Thursday
 

1310
01:05:15 --> 01:05:18
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

1311
01:05:18 --> 01:05:23
PROFESSOR: When she came to,
she might not remember having

1312
01:05:23 --> 01:05:27
actually been hit, because the
set of memories from

1313
01:05:27 --> 01:05:31
immediately before that whop
would have been wiped out in

1314
01:05:31 --> 01:05:32
a retrograde amnesia.
 

1315
01:05:32 --> 01:05:37
It is also possible that she
wouldn't remember things for a

1316
01:05:37 --> 01:05:40
period of time after she had
regained consciousness, if I

1317
01:05:40 --> 01:05:42
managed to knock her
out completely.

1318
01:05:42 --> 01:05:44
There might be a period of
time after she regained

1319
01:05:44 --> 01:05:49
consciousness before her memory
would -- she might have been

1320
01:05:49 --> 01:05:54
talking and wandering around
and say, I'm fine, I'm fine.

1321
01:05:54 --> 01:05:56
But have no recollection
of that either.

1322
01:05:56 --> 01:06:00
That would be an
anterograde amnesia.

1323
01:06:00 --> 01:06:03
Sorry I didn't really mean
to hit you on the head.

1324
01:06:03 --> 01:06:04
You'll be fine.
 

1325
01:06:04 --> 01:06:07
 
 

1326
01:06:07 --> 01:06:12
So let me say a few words in
the remaining time about

1327
01:06:12 --> 01:06:17
retrieval from memory.
 

1328
01:06:17 --> 01:06:18
Like any of these
topics, there's a

1329
01:06:18 --> 01:06:19
great deal to be said.
 

1330
01:06:19 --> 01:06:22
But probably the most important
thing to understand about

1331
01:06:22 --> 01:06:26
retrieval from memory is that
retrieval particularly if any

1332
01:06:26 --> 01:06:35
rich sort of memory is not the
recovery, the replay, of the

1333
01:06:35 --> 01:06:46
tape for some true guaranteed
image of what you experienced

1334
01:06:46 --> 01:06:49
or what you learned or
something like that.

1335
01:06:49 --> 01:06:53
This sort of image here of a
scaffolding holding together

1336
01:06:53 --> 01:06:58
that memory is also an image of
a notion that any memory is

1337
01:06:58 --> 01:07:02
probably stored multipley and
in different bits of brain.

1338
01:07:02 --> 01:07:04
Different aspects of
different bits of brain.

1339
01:07:04 --> 01:07:07
And if you want to recall
it, that what you're doing

1340
01:07:07 --> 01:07:11
is reconstructing it.
 

1341
01:07:11 --> 01:07:15
You can probably get some
intuition about this if you

1342
01:07:15 --> 01:07:21
asked yourself about famous
stories about you in your

1343
01:07:21 --> 01:07:28
childhood that are famous in
your family that you remember.

1344
01:07:28 --> 01:07:32
Not just the stories they tell
about you from when you hit

1345
01:07:32 --> 01:07:33
with the bat and
stuff like that.

1346
01:07:33 --> 01:07:36
But stories that you remember
is sort of shaping incidents

1347
01:07:36 --> 01:07:37
in your childhood.
 

1348
01:07:37 --> 01:07:42
But that also get retold
every time the family

1349
01:07:42 --> 01:07:44
gets together, right.
 

1350
01:07:44 --> 01:07:48
So in the Jewish tradition is
a holiday called Passover.

1351
01:07:48 --> 01:07:51
The tradition is that you
drink four cups of wine.

1352
01:07:51 --> 01:07:53
It's not really a brilliant
tradition if you happen to

1353
01:07:53 --> 01:07:56
be about four years old.
 

1354
01:07:56 --> 01:08:01
And I vividly remember my
sister getting into the nice

1355
01:08:01 --> 01:08:06
sweet wine that you drink and
conching out at the table.

1356
01:08:06 --> 01:08:09
And I know whose
house we were at.

1357
01:08:09 --> 01:08:13
This is a tale that has been
retold to my sister's no doubt

1358
01:08:13 --> 01:08:18
the light every year for the
intervening 40 plus years.

1359
01:08:18 --> 01:08:23
And it is absolutely unclear to
me given what I subsequently

1360
01:08:23 --> 01:08:26
learned about memory, whether
what I am remembering is the

1361
01:08:26 --> 01:08:29
original event at this point or
reconstruction based on

1362
01:08:29 --> 01:08:31
all the family stories.
 

1363
01:08:31 --> 01:08:33
I think I can still remember
the original thing, but there's

1364
01:08:33 --> 01:08:34
no real way of knowing.
 

1365
01:08:34 --> 01:08:41
What you are remembering
is a reconstruction.

1366
01:08:41 --> 01:08:44
Before I talk more about
that, let me load you up

1367
01:08:44 --> 01:08:47
with some more words.
 

1368
01:08:47 --> 01:08:50
These aren't going to
be nonsense unless

1369
01:08:50 --> 01:08:51
I can't find them.
 

1370
01:08:51 --> 01:08:52
There we go.
 

1371
01:08:52 --> 01:08:54
There's some nice words.
 

1372
01:08:54 --> 01:08:56
Which words do I want to use.
 

1373
01:08:56 --> 01:08:57
Oh these are good words.
 

1374
01:08:57 --> 01:08:59
OK.
 

1375
01:08:59 --> 01:09:01
I'm going to read you a list
of words, and then we'll

1376
01:09:01 --> 01:09:02
do a recognition test.
 

1377
01:09:02 --> 01:09:05
Don't have to write
anything down this time.

1378
01:09:05 --> 01:09:07
I'm going to read you a list of
words, and you're just going to

1379
01:09:07 --> 01:09:10
tell me the word was on the
list or the word was

1380
01:09:10 --> 01:09:11
not on the list.
 

1381
01:09:11 --> 01:09:13
Ready?
 

1382
01:09:13 --> 01:09:16
So try to remember
all of these.

1383
01:09:16 --> 01:09:19
Fury.
 

1384
01:09:19 --> 01:09:21

1391
01:09:35 --> 01:09:38

1392
01:09:38 --> 01:09:40
Fear.
 

1393
01:09:40 --> 01:09:42
Mean.

Mad.

1396
01:09:47 --> 01:09:49

1397
01:09:49 --> 01:09:51

1398
01:09:51 --> 01:09:51
OK.
 

1399
01:09:51 --> 01:09:54
You got all those nicely
stored in memory?

1400
01:09:54 --> 01:09:55
OK.
 

1401
01:09:55 --> 01:09:57
So let's see, where's
my test list here?

1402
01:09:57 --> 01:09:59
Looks like my test list.
 

1403
01:09:59 --> 01:10:01
OK.
 

1404
01:10:01 --> 01:10:02
Did you hear the word fight?
 

1405
01:10:02 --> 01:10:03
AUDIENCE: Yes.
 

1406
01:10:03 --> 01:10:04

01:10:15 --> 01:10:16
AUDIENCE: Yes.
 

1418
01:10:16 --> 01:10:17
PROFESSOR: Anger?
 

1419
01:10:17 --> 01:10:18
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

1420
01:10:18 --> 01:10:22
PROFESSOR: Well.
 

1421
01:10:22 --> 01:10:24
 
 

1422
01:10:24 --> 01:10:25
Road?
 

1423
01:10:25 --> 01:10:26
AUDIENCE: Yes.
 

1424
01:10:26 --> 01:10:27
PROFESSOR: Ire?
 

1425
01:10:27 --> 01:10:28
AUDIENCE: Yes.
 

1426
01:10:28 --> 01:10:30
PROFESSOR: Hatred?
 

1427
01:10:30 --> 01:10:30
AUDIENCE: No.
 

1428
01:10:30 --> 01:10:33
PROFESSOR: OK.
 

1429
01:10:33 --> 01:10:34
How about enrage?
 

1430
01:10:34 --> 01:10:35
AUDIENCE: Yes.
 

1431
01:10:35 --> 01:10:36
PROFESSOR: OK.
 

1432
01:10:36 --> 01:10:42
so there were a couple in there
where you could hear people

1433
01:10:42 --> 01:10:49
hesitating, or you could hear
a diversion of opinion.

1434
01:10:49 --> 01:10:52
And those are the
critical elements there.

1435
01:10:52 --> 01:10:55
The most critical element in
this case is the word anger,

1436
01:10:55 --> 01:10:59
which a fair number of people
asserted it was on the list.

1437
01:10:59 --> 01:11:00
It was not in fact on the list.
 

1438
01:11:00 --> 01:11:03
And even those people who were
asserting that it was not on

1439
01:11:03 --> 01:11:08
the list, there was a
measurable what's

1440
01:11:08 --> 01:11:10
going on there.
 

1441
01:11:10 --> 01:11:13
This is in effect known as
the Deese-Roediger-McDermott

1442
01:11:13 --> 01:11:17
effect or on the handout the
Deese-Roediger-McDermott demo.

discovered it.

1444
01:11:21 --> 01:11:24
And then like all good
phenomena in psychology

1445
01:11:24 --> 01:11:27
discovered that Deese had
published it 10 years prior.

1446
01:11:27 --> 01:11:30
And so it now goes by
all of their names.

1447
01:11:30 --> 01:11:34
In any case, what they did,
they were deliberately looking

1448
01:11:34 --> 01:11:36
for this, what they did was
they -- where did my

1449
01:11:36 --> 01:11:37
semantic network go?
 

1450
01:11:37 --> 01:11:39
Oh here's my semantic network.
 

1451
01:11:39 --> 01:11:44
What they did was they took a
word and they asked people to

1452
01:11:44 --> 01:11:46
give the associates to it.
 

1453
01:11:46 --> 01:11:49
So let's take the word anger.
 

1454
01:11:49 --> 01:11:52
What words come to mind when
you think of the word anger?

1455
01:11:52 --> 01:11:57
Well fight, rage,
enrage, emotion, ire.

1456
01:11:57 --> 01:11:58
This collection of words.
 

1457
01:11:58 --> 01:12:04
You then use a training list of
words that has the associates,

1458
01:12:04 --> 01:12:06
but not the target word.
 

1459
01:12:06 --> 01:12:11
And what you're in effect
doing is saying, animal,

1460
01:12:11 --> 01:12:16
meow, mouse, dog, fur.
 

1461
01:12:16 --> 01:12:20
And each time you do that, the
spreading activation gets all

1462
01:12:20 --> 01:12:24
sorts of stuff, but all of
these are pointing towards cat.

1463
01:12:24 --> 01:12:27
And then later I say well
was cats on the list?

1464
01:12:27 --> 01:12:30
And you go and look at that
note and lo and behold it's

1465
01:12:30 --> 01:12:32
glowing softly in your mind.
 

1466
01:12:32 --> 01:12:36
And you say, yeah, yeah.
 

1467
01:12:36 --> 01:12:38
That was there.
 

1468
01:12:38 --> 01:12:42
And if you take one of other,
it didn't particularly work in

1469
01:12:42 --> 01:12:44
this case, ire sometimes
works for instance.

1470
01:12:44 --> 01:12:48
You take a word like ire people
are no more sure that ire was

1471
01:12:48 --> 01:12:53
on the list than they are
that anger was on the list.

1472
01:12:53 --> 01:12:57
People are thoroughly in these
experiments confused about

1473
01:12:57 --> 01:13:01
whether or not the target
word was on the list.

1474
01:13:01 --> 01:13:07
Because you don't have access
to the truth about your memore.

1475
01:13:07 --> 01:13:08
You have the access to
what you can manage to

1476
01:13:08 --> 01:13:10
reconstruct about it.
 

1477
01:13:10 --> 01:13:11
Now that's fine.
 

1478
01:13:11 --> 01:13:17
That sounds benign enough as a
lab demo, but let's suppose

1479
01:13:17 --> 01:13:21
that you're not just sitting in
some nice intro psych

1480
01:13:21 --> 01:13:25
class, but you're sitting
in the witness box.

1481
01:13:25 --> 01:13:27
And somebody is saying,
where were you on the

1482
01:13:27 --> 01:13:30
night of May 5th?
 

1483
01:13:30 --> 01:13:32
And expecting you
to tell the truth.

1484
01:13:32 --> 01:13:34
Well of course you're going to
try to tell the truth, but the

1485
01:13:34 --> 01:13:40
truth in this case is going to
get shaped by the nature of

1486
01:13:40 --> 01:13:44
your particular semantic
network, among other things.

1487
01:13:44 --> 01:13:46
Let's talk about that
part a little bit first.

1488
01:13:46 --> 01:13:51
Famous experiment done first in
the 40's replicated many times

1489
01:13:51 --> 01:13:53
since in many different
ways, but let me describe

1490
01:13:53 --> 01:13:56
the original version.
 

1491
01:13:56 --> 01:14:00
You, and in this case you
are a white male, are

1492
01:14:00 --> 01:14:05
shown a depiction of an
altercation on a subway.

1493
01:14:05 --> 01:14:07
Two guys get into a fight.
 

1494
01:14:07 --> 01:14:10
In the 40's it was done as
a hand drawing cartoon.

1495
01:14:10 --> 01:14:12
It's been replicated with,
you know, snazzy video.

1496
01:14:12 --> 01:14:14
It doesn't matter.
 

1497
01:14:14 --> 01:14:18
Two guys get into a fight,
or get into a sort of

1498
01:14:18 --> 01:14:19
shouting kind of argument.
 

1499
01:14:19 --> 01:14:24
At some point one guy pulls a
knife, and then sometimes

1500
01:14:24 --> 01:14:27
subsequent we'll ask
you about this, OK.

1501
01:14:27 --> 01:14:34
 
 

1502
01:14:34 --> 01:14:35
Well the question you're
going to be asked is

1503
01:14:35 --> 01:14:37
who pulled the knife.
 

1504
01:14:37 --> 01:14:41
And the variable of interest is
the race of the participants.

1505
01:14:41 --> 01:14:44
So you got a nice
little 2 by 2 here.

1506
01:14:44 --> 01:14:48
They can both be caucasian,
they can both be African

1507
01:14:48 --> 01:14:51
American, or it can be crossed.
 

1508
01:14:51 --> 01:14:55
The interesting and disturbing
finding is the number of times

1509
01:14:55 --> 01:15:01
when the knife is pulled by the
white guy, it ends up in memory

1510
01:15:01 --> 01:15:04
in the hand of the black guy.
 

1511
01:15:04 --> 01:15:07
Now as I say, this has
been replicated all

1512
01:15:07 --> 01:15:08
sorts of different ways.
 

1513
01:15:08 --> 01:15:10
This is not a, you know,
white guys are all

1514
01:15:10 --> 01:15:13
biggits experiment.
 

1515
01:15:13 --> 01:15:17
This is we all have biases, and
the interesting and disturbing

1516
01:15:17 --> 01:15:22
thing is that they can actually
interfere with what we think

1517
01:15:22 --> 01:15:25
of as, you know, our
nice clear memory.

1518
01:15:25 --> 01:15:27
These people weren't sitting
there saying, you know, oh yeah

1519
01:15:27 --> 01:15:32
I'm being paid, you know, 1940
$0.10 an hour to be in

1520
01:15:32 --> 01:15:33
this psych experiment.
 

1521
01:15:33 --> 01:15:37
Why don't I see if I can stick
it to an imaginary black guy.

1522
01:15:37 --> 01:15:39
No.
 

1523
01:15:39 --> 01:15:44
They were presumably being
as honest as they could be.

1524
01:15:44 --> 01:15:48
But the structure
of their memory.

1525
01:15:48 --> 01:15:52
Which included things like who
do I think might pull a knife,

1526
01:15:52 --> 01:15:56
influenced what they recalled,
what they pulled out of memory.

1527
01:15:56 --> 01:15:58
And we can impose this
structure from the

1528
01:15:58 --> 01:16:00
outside as well.
 

1529
01:16:00 --> 01:16:03
So suppose we do the
following experiment.

1530
01:16:03 --> 01:16:06
This is an experiment
also done many different

1531
01:16:06 --> 01:16:10
ways at this point.
 

1532
01:16:10 --> 01:16:13
Elizabeth Loftus is the
name associated with

1533
01:16:13 --> 01:16:16
this line of work.
 

1534
01:16:16 --> 01:16:18
You're going to
see another film.

1535
01:16:18 --> 01:16:20
This time you're going
to watch a car crash.

1536
01:16:20 --> 01:16:25
The red car is going to
get into an accident

1537
01:16:25 --> 01:16:27
with the blue car.
 

1538
01:16:27 --> 01:16:29
All right.
 

1539
01:16:29 --> 01:16:29
OK.
 

1540
01:16:29 --> 01:16:30
You see this.
 

1541
01:16:30 --> 01:16:31
You're going to be
asked about it.

1542
01:16:31 --> 01:16:33
We'll show all of you
guys the same film.

1543
01:16:33 --> 01:16:37
And now we'll ask the question
three different ways.

1544
01:16:37 --> 01:16:46
At what speed did the red
car bump into the blue car?

1545
01:16:46 --> 01:16:51
At what speed did the red
car hit the blue car?

1546
01:16:51 --> 01:16:55
At what speed did the red car
smashed into the blue car?

1547
01:16:55 --> 01:16:57
That's the only
manipulation here.

1548
01:16:57 --> 01:17:01
You all saw the same video.
 

1549
01:17:01 --> 01:17:04
So what do you figure
the difference is?

1550
01:17:04 --> 01:17:07
What's the result look like?
 

1551
01:17:07 --> 01:17:12
So who gives the higher
speed responses?

1552
01:17:12 --> 01:17:12
AUDIENCE: The smashed guy.
 

1553
01:17:12 --> 01:17:14
PROFESSOR: The smashed
guys Lawyers know this.

1554
01:17:14 --> 01:17:20
This is why courts attempts
to avoid leading question.

1555
01:17:20 --> 01:17:22
But it's very hard to avoid.
 

1556
01:17:22 --> 01:17:27
But, you know, that's a
pretty subtle kind of lead.

1557
01:17:27 --> 01:17:28
But it's not a subtle
kind of effect.

1558
01:17:28 --> 01:17:32
It's about as I recall a 15 MPH
kind of effect, which is a sort

1559
01:17:32 --> 01:17:37
of thing that has an impact,
you should pardon the

1560
01:17:37 --> 01:17:40
expression, on what a jury is
going to think about whether or

1561
01:17:40 --> 01:17:44
not you, the driver of that red
car, was at fault or not.

1562
01:17:44 --> 01:17:49
If you were screaming through
the intersection at 45 MPH

1563
01:17:49 --> 01:17:52
that's worse than if you're
screaming through the

1564
01:17:52 --> 01:17:55
intersection at 30 MPH
or something like that.

1565
01:17:55 --> 01:18:02
So your memory can be
influenced by the way that you

1566
01:18:02 --> 01:18:04
are asked about that memory.
 

1567
01:18:04 --> 01:18:08
This shows up not
just on the stand.

1568
01:18:08 --> 01:18:12
Well actually a version of this
shows up beautifully in the

1569
01:18:12 --> 01:18:18
experience of most people at
some point who come to MIT.

1570
01:18:18 --> 01:18:23
Most people who get to MIT are
smart people, and they would

1571
01:18:23 --> 01:18:25
do well to remember that.
 

1572
01:18:25 --> 01:18:28
Because most people sometime,
like within the first few weeks

1573
01:18:28 --> 01:18:32
of being at MIT, receive a data
point of some sort that

1574
01:18:32 --> 01:18:35
suggests that this
might not be true.

1575
01:18:35 --> 01:18:36
Right?
 

1576
01:18:36 --> 01:18:38
Like the first calculus test
or something like that.

1577
01:18:38 --> 01:18:42
You've never gotten a score
below 99.8 on a math

1578
01:18:42 --> 01:18:43
test in your life.
 

1579
01:18:43 --> 01:18:46
You get back the first test
in 18 or whatever it was,

1580
01:18:46 --> 01:18:51
and you know, 10 cool.
 

1581
01:18:51 --> 01:18:53
Oh man it's not 10
out of 10 is it?

1582
01:18:53 --> 01:18:54
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

1583
01:18:54 --> 01:18:55
PROFESSOR: You know
this is really bad.

1584
01:18:55 --> 01:18:58
And so that's a
depressing data point.

1585
01:18:58 --> 01:19:02
But a surprising number of
people come to the conclusion

1586
01:19:02 --> 01:19:05
from that, that they not
only are stupid but

1587
01:19:05 --> 01:19:07
always were stupid.
 

1588
01:19:07 --> 01:19:15
And probably unlovely and
generally, you know, bad,

1589
01:19:15 --> 01:19:16
horrible individuals.
 

1590
01:19:16 --> 01:19:21
And you should remember
this is one of these

1591
01:19:21 --> 01:19:25
sort of context effects.
 

1592
01:19:25 --> 01:19:26
That may be a little
over stating it.

1593
01:19:26 --> 01:19:29
But look you know -- and this
has actually been tested with

1594
01:19:29 --> 01:19:32
clinical populations of
depressive people who go from

1595
01:19:32 --> 01:19:34
being depressed to
being undepressed.

1596
01:19:34 --> 01:19:38
Suppose you ask somebody who's
depressed clinically or

1597
01:19:38 --> 01:19:40
otherwise, you wake up in the
morning it's pouring

1598
01:19:40 --> 01:19:42
cold rain out there.
 

1599
01:19:42 --> 01:19:45
The problems that did you get
done because you fell asleep

1600
01:19:45 --> 01:19:47
in there, and there are
now drool marks on it.

1601
01:19:47 --> 01:19:50
And not only is there drook
mark, there's a little heart

1602
01:19:50 --> 01:19:53
shaped note next to it
saying, I'm leaving

1603
01:19:53 --> 01:19:54
you for your roommate.
 

1604
01:19:54 --> 01:19:55
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]
 

1605
01:19:55 --> 01:19:57
PROFESSOR: Right?
 

1606
01:19:57 --> 01:20:05
So if I asked you at that
point how was your childhood?

1607
01:20:05 --> 01:20:09
Not how do you feel, but what
kind of childhood did you have?

1608
01:20:09 --> 01:20:12
You had not maybe a
miserable childhood.

1609
01:20:12 --> 01:20:15
But to exaggerate, you know,
you grew up in a closet.

1610
01:20:15 --> 01:20:18
 
 

1611
01:20:18 --> 01:20:21
Later on if you're feeling
better I ask you about

1612
01:20:21 --> 01:20:22
the same childhood.
 

1613
01:20:22 --> 01:20:25
The childhood has
magically improved.

1614
01:20:25 --> 01:20:26
All right.
 

1615
01:20:26 --> 01:20:30
We'll see you on Thursday
if I remember correctly.

1616
01:20:30 --> 01:20:31
