00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.
 

7
00:00:18 --> 00:00:25
I want to do two things
today and they involve two

8
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
sets of Freudian jargon.
 

9
00:00:28 --> 00:00:33
I want to talk about Freud's so
called structural psychology

10
00:00:33 --> 00:00:39
that involves the terms id,
ego, and superego and will give

11
00:00:39 --> 00:00:44
me a brief chance to talk
about Freud's theory of

12
00:00:44 --> 00:00:46
civilization as a whole.
 

13
00:00:46 --> 00:00:48
And then I want to talk about
Freud's developmental

14
00:00:48 --> 00:00:52
psychology which is where we
get these notions of an oral,

15
00:00:52 --> 00:00:56
anal, phallic, and then onto
latency in adult stages

16
00:00:56 --> 00:00:58
of development.
 

17
00:00:58 --> 00:01:02
And that'll give me a chance to
talk about fairy tales or more

18
00:01:02 --> 00:01:09
broadly about the practice of
using Freudian ideas to

19
00:01:09 --> 00:01:14
interpret literary texts.
 

20
00:01:14 --> 00:01:18
The second part may well
run into next Tuesday

21
00:01:18 --> 00:01:19
as I think about it.
 

22
00:01:19 --> 00:01:23
 
 

23
00:01:23 --> 00:01:30
Freud thought that babies came
into the world thinking that

24
00:01:30 --> 00:01:34
they were co-extensive
with the universe.

25
00:01:34 --> 00:01:36
That they were everything.
 

26
00:01:36 --> 00:01:39
Not that they were looking
out in space saying, look,

27
00:01:39 --> 00:01:40
the stars-- they're me.
 

28
00:01:40 --> 00:01:46
But that what the initial
experience of being a conscious

29
00:01:46 --> 00:01:50
entity was thinking that
you're it, you're everything.

30
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
It's not as though
that's new with Freud.

31
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
I won't attempt to do a reading
of the piece of Tennyson that I

32
00:01:55 --> 00:01:57
put on the handout because
I discover I'm a bad

33
00:01:57 --> 00:01:58
reader of Tennyson.
 

34
00:01:58 --> 00:02:04
 
 

35
00:02:04 --> 00:02:08
But if you read that you will
see Tennyson saying very

36
00:02:08 --> 00:02:09
much the same thing.
 

37
00:02:09 --> 00:02:15
That the job of an infant is to
learn the use of I and me and

38
00:02:15 --> 00:02:18
finds, I am not what I
see other than the

39
00:02:18 --> 00:02:19
things I touched.
 

40
00:02:19 --> 00:02:23
You've got to figure out what's
you and what's not you.

41
00:02:23 --> 00:02:30
Freud thought this little
bundle of-- that this universe

42
00:02:30 --> 00:02:34
of a baby wanted one thing,
which talked about last time.

43
00:02:34 --> 00:02:38
The kid wants pleasure and
the kid wants pleasure now,

44
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
anyway he/she can get it.
 

45
00:02:40 --> 00:02:45
That collection of
unbridled desires is what

46
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
Freud called the id.
 

47
00:02:47 --> 00:02:50
Now this all looks like very
fancy or not very fancy-- looks

48
00:02:50 --> 00:02:53
like jargon, but in Freud's
original writing it's not

49
00:02:53 --> 00:02:53
particularly jargony.
 

50
00:02:53 --> 00:02:57
It is just a Latinization
of the word for it, the

51
00:02:57 --> 00:02:59
animal piece of you.
 

52
00:02:59 --> 00:03:07
The it that wants stuff
and wants it now.

53
00:03:07 --> 00:03:13
The id is essentially
unconscious.

54
00:03:13 --> 00:03:16
And well, actually to combine
the two bits of the -- where

55
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
does the id get its pleasures?
 

56
00:03:19 --> 00:03:25
Freud's series of developmental
stages were driven by a notion

57
00:03:25 --> 00:03:29
of where the sources of
pleasure were in the kid's

58
00:03:29 --> 00:03:34
life and so initially for
instance, it's all oral.

59
00:03:34 --> 00:03:41
The fact that this all has a
sexual overrun to it is in

60
00:03:41 --> 00:03:47
fact, probably more problem for
Freud than useful for Freud.

61
00:03:47 --> 00:03:50
 
 

62
00:03:50 --> 00:03:53
All right, so the kids get
some-- oral stuff-- that what's

63
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
giving the kid pleasure.
 

64
00:03:55 --> 00:03:56
That's sort of interesting.
 

65
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
What really is important in
this early stage of development

66
00:03:59 --> 00:04:04
though is well, one of the
things is figuring

67
00:04:04 --> 00:04:06
out who I am.
 

68
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
How much of this
universe belongs to me?

69
00:04:08 --> 00:04:12
And is this universe
a safe place?

70
00:04:12 --> 00:04:16
The real force behind Freud's
stages of development are these

71
00:04:16 --> 00:04:20
stages where particular issues
emerge really for

72
00:04:20 --> 00:04:21
the first time.
 

73
00:04:21 --> 00:04:24
Issues that will then turn
out to be important for the

74
00:04:24 --> 00:04:25
rest of people's lives.
 

75
00:04:25 --> 00:04:31
So the initial issue that comes
up in this oral stage of

76
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
development is safety.
 

77
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
Am I going to be fed
when I need to be fed?

78
00:04:35 --> 00:04:37
Am I going to be warm enough?
 

79
00:04:37 --> 00:04:39
Am I going to be taken care of?
 

80
00:04:39 --> 00:04:44
That's newborn stuff, but it's
not stuff that goes away.

81
00:04:44 --> 00:04:50
You know that concerns about,
is the world a safe place is

82
00:04:50 --> 00:04:54
the sort of things that can
occupy your mind now too.

83
00:04:54 --> 00:04:57
How you understand the world,
how you understand those

84
00:04:57 --> 00:05:01
problems says Freud -- not
unreasonably -- are likely to

85
00:05:01 --> 00:05:05
be shaped by these
early experiences.

86
00:05:05 --> 00:05:10
If your early experiences is
of a safe, comfortable world

87
00:05:10 --> 00:05:13
you're going to treat later
challenges differently than if

88
00:05:13 --> 00:05:16
your early experiences-- who
knows if mom's ever going to

89
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
get around to feeding me again.
 

90
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
That's going to be a different
kind of experience.

91
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
The anal stage-- all
right, why is it anal?

92
00:05:23 --> 00:05:27
Well, it's anal because Freud
had some notion that there's

93
00:05:27 --> 00:05:30
certain pleasures in the
elimination process

94
00:05:30 --> 00:05:31
and things like that.
 

95
00:05:31 --> 00:05:36
But the real issue here, the
life-long issue that emerges

96
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
is who's in control?
 

97
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
And the reason that's an anal
stage issue is because this is

98
00:05:43 --> 00:05:49
the point at which if you're
an infant it's not just

99
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
anything goes anymore.
 

100
00:05:51 --> 00:05:56
Up to this point the first
great crisis of control in a

101
00:05:56 --> 00:06:00
little child's life is very
often toilet training.

102
00:06:00 --> 00:06:02
Up to this point you could
do whatever you wanted,

103
00:06:02 --> 00:06:04
wherever you want to do it.
 

104
00:06:04 --> 00:06:08
Now all of a sudden somebody's
saying, do it there, now.

105
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
Don't play with it.
 

106
00:06:10 --> 00:06:15
Don't do any of the various--
it wasn't disgusting before.

107
00:06:15 --> 00:06:19
Back when I was very little
they looked at it-- oh,

108
00:06:19 --> 00:06:20
great [UNINTELLIGIBLE].
 

109
00:06:20 --> 00:06:22
Now it's disgusting and I
gotta put it over there.

110
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
What's this about?
 

111
00:06:24 --> 00:06:28
And you got to figure out
how much control do you

112
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
have over yourself?
 

113
00:06:30 --> 00:06:37
And how much are you in the
control of somebody else?

114
00:06:37 --> 00:06:43
Here the issue is identity.
 

115
00:06:43 --> 00:06:44
Who am I?
 

116
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
Identity.
 

117
00:06:46 --> 00:06:47
Who am I?
 

118
00:06:47 --> 00:06:51
And more specifically,
what does it mean to

119
00:06:51 --> 00:06:54
the male or female?
 

120
00:06:54 --> 00:06:59
I'll come back to the details
of that a little later on

121
00:06:59 --> 00:07:02
because it gets me a little
ahead of the story.

122
00:07:02 --> 00:07:05
Presently we're still back
here with little Mister Id.

123
00:07:05 --> 00:07:13
This unbridled collection
desires who wants everything

124
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
and wants it now.
 

125
00:07:15 --> 00:07:20
At some point the id runs up
against what Freud called the

126
00:07:20 --> 00:07:24
reality principle, which is you
can't get what you want all the

127
00:07:24 --> 00:07:26
time, exactly when you want it.
 

128
00:07:26 --> 00:07:30
If you haven't noticed
this at this point that's

129
00:07:30 --> 00:07:31
probably a little grim.
 

130
00:07:31 --> 00:07:35
The ego, which is just
the Latinization of the

131
00:07:35 --> 00:07:38
word for I or the self.
 

132
00:07:38 --> 00:07:45
The ego grows out of the
collision of this little

133
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
Miss Id with reality.
 

134
00:07:48 --> 00:07:56
So the ego has to check
the desires of the id.

135
00:07:56 --> 00:08:01
And the ego is sort of the
embodiment of this effort to

136
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
figure out how much of the
universe really is me.

137
00:08:04 --> 00:08:08
So the sort of thing you can
imagine a kid discovering is

138
00:08:08 --> 00:08:10
all right, I'm an
oral stage baby.

139
00:08:10 --> 00:08:13
I like sucking on stuff.
 

140
00:08:13 --> 00:08:17
There are some things that I
can suck on anytime I want.

141
00:08:17 --> 00:08:20
You know there's this
thumb thing-- anytime

142
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
I want it it's there.
 

143
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
There's other things, like
the bottle or the breast or

144
00:08:25 --> 00:08:28
whatever, they're different.
 

145
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
I like them, but they're
fundamentally different.

146
00:08:30 --> 00:08:33
They're not me.
 

147
00:08:33 --> 00:08:37
At the most basic level you
have to figure out how

148
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
much of the world is you.
 

149
00:08:39 --> 00:08:46
Now this again, ramifies
through the rest of your life.

150
00:08:46 --> 00:08:51
If you grow up considering that
you are co-extensive with the

151
00:08:51 --> 00:08:56
universe and that you make the
planets turn in their orbits,

152
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
you're going to be an
odd adult, right?

153
00:08:59 --> 00:09:01
You've got to shrink
it down from that.

154
00:09:01 --> 00:09:05
If you shrink down too far--
I'm not in control of anything.

155
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
This didn't work
out well for me.

156
00:09:07 --> 00:09:08
I'm not in control
of everything.

157
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
I'm just a little worm pushed
around by force-- you know,

158
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
that's not going to be
very healthy either.

159
00:09:13 --> 00:09:16
So the job of this emerging ego
is to come up with some

160
00:09:16 --> 00:09:21
reasonable estimate of what
your powers are and what it is

161
00:09:21 --> 00:09:26
that you might be in some
sort of control over.

162
00:09:26 --> 00:09:30
So now the ego's busy there
fighting with the id.

163
00:09:30 --> 00:09:33
So that the id is saying I want
to kill my little brother.

164
00:09:33 --> 00:09:34
The ego says, you
can't do that.

165
00:09:34 --> 00:09:36
The id says, how come?
 

166
00:09:36 --> 00:09:41
The ego says, well because
mom would whack us.

167
00:09:41 --> 00:09:42
And the id says, I don't care.
 

168
00:09:42 --> 00:09:43
I still want to kill him.
 

169
00:09:43 --> 00:09:46
And the ego at this point
starts to say things

170
00:09:46 --> 00:09:47
like forget it.
 

171
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
We're going to
repress that idea.

172
00:09:49 --> 00:09:50
This is where you get the
beginnings of ideas of

173
00:09:50 --> 00:09:54
repression that I was
talking about last time.

174
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57
All of these Freudian bits
of theories attempt to

175
00:09:57 --> 00:10:00
interlock in some fashion.
 

176
00:10:00 --> 00:10:04
So the ego is busy taking the
more unacceptable bits of the

177
00:10:04 --> 00:10:10
id and stuffing them away in
that unconscious reservoir

178
00:10:10 --> 00:10:11
of the repressed.
 

179
00:10:11 --> 00:10:14
Now you'll see that that's
gotten you from an id who

180
00:10:14 --> 00:10:16
just was ruled by pleasure.
 

181
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
This really essentially
amoral id.

182
00:10:18 --> 00:10:22
You've now got the beginnings
of a sense of morality here.

183
00:10:22 --> 00:10:25
It's not very sophisticated,
but it's on the one

184
00:10:25 --> 00:10:27
hand, this would be fun.
 

185
00:10:27 --> 00:10:30
On the other hand, we
can't do it because we

186
00:10:30 --> 00:10:31
might get punished.
 

187
00:10:31 --> 00:10:32
So it's sort of a
reward and punishment.

188
00:10:32 --> 00:10:34
Why not rob the bank?
 

189
00:10:34 --> 00:10:35
Because you'll get arrested
and thrown in jail.

190
00:10:35 --> 00:10:42
It's that sort of crime and
punishment kind of morality.

191
00:10:42 --> 00:10:47
Morality gets more complicated
when you reach this oedipal

192
00:10:47 --> 00:10:52
stage of development.
 

193
00:10:52 --> 00:10:58
To explain that I need to say a
little more about that stage,

194
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
which I can see that on the
handout I promised I would.

195
00:11:01 --> 00:11:04
 
 

196
00:11:04 --> 00:11:06
I'll do the male
version of this.

197
00:11:06 --> 00:11:11
If this is about identity and
particularly, sexual identity--

198
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
there's going to be a male
story and a female story.

199
00:11:14 --> 00:11:15
Let's do the male story
and we'll come back

200
00:11:15 --> 00:11:16
to the female story.
 

201
00:11:16 --> 00:11:25
 
 

202
00:11:25 --> 00:11:28
The large scale notion that
makes some degree of sense is

203
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
that you've got to figure out
what does it mean to be a male?

204
00:11:31 --> 00:11:38
That's an important thing to
figure out and it's likely that

205
00:11:38 --> 00:11:42
Dad or other adult males in the
immediate vicinity are going to

206
00:11:42 --> 00:11:47
be sort of a model for what
that's going to mean.

207
00:11:47 --> 00:11:55
The difficulty for Freud or the
start of the conflict in an

208
00:11:55 --> 00:12:00
oedipal conflict is that the
child starts very much

209
00:12:00 --> 00:12:02
attached to Mom.
 

210
00:12:02 --> 00:12:05
It's Mom who provides
nourishment.

211
00:12:05 --> 00:12:09
It's Mom who gave birth
to you and so on.

212
00:12:09 --> 00:12:10
How are you going to
get an attachment or

213
00:12:10 --> 00:12:12
identification with Dad?
 

214
00:12:12 --> 00:12:16
Well, what Freud proposed was
that little kids, little boys--

215
00:12:16 --> 00:12:20
stick with boys here-- little
boys initially see themselves

216
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
in competition with Dad.
 

217
00:12:22 --> 00:12:24
They like Mom.
 

218
00:12:24 --> 00:12:25
Mom is great.
 

219
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
They want Mom.
 

220
00:12:27 --> 00:12:31
All right, it's called oedipal
because Freud saw a parallel

221
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
with the Greek Myth of Oedipus.
 

222
00:12:33 --> 00:12:37
Oedipus, who kills his father
and marries his mother.

223
00:12:37 --> 00:12:41
So you get this weird notion
that somehow Freud thought

224
00:12:41 --> 00:12:44
little boys wanted to sexually
possess their mothers and that

225
00:12:44 --> 00:12:47
sounds both weird and icky.
 

226
00:12:47 --> 00:12:51
 
 

227
00:12:51 --> 00:12:53
Freud didn't do himself any
help here, he was talking

228
00:12:53 --> 00:12:55
about infantile sexuality.
 

229
00:12:55 --> 00:12:57
Everybody heard the sexuality
bit and sort of left

230
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
off the infantile bit.
 

231
00:13:00 --> 00:13:02
Freud is not thinking
in any sort of adult

232
00:13:02 --> 00:13:03
sexual terms here.
 

233
00:13:03 --> 00:13:06
He's saying look, the
little kid likes Mom.

234
00:13:06 --> 00:13:07
Mom's a good thing.
 

235
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
He wants Mom all to himself.
 

236
00:13:09 --> 00:13:12
Now it turns out
that there's Dad.

237
00:13:12 --> 00:13:17
Dad mysteriously seems to
have some claim on Mom, too.

238
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
And so the little kid in this
infantile kind of way figures,

239
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
I'm going to have
it out with Dad.

240
00:13:23 --> 00:13:26
We're going to have a fight
here man because there's only

241
00:13:26 --> 00:13:30
one Mom and I want her.
 

242
00:13:30 --> 00:13:34
I've still got a lot of id
going on here, I want Mom and--

243
00:13:34 --> 00:13:36
all right, that's Stage One.
 

244
00:13:36 --> 00:13:38
That's the conflict stage.
 

245
00:13:38 --> 00:13:40
I can't remember what buzz word
I used for the second stage.

246
00:13:40 --> 00:13:43
Oh, the second stage
is capitulation.

247
00:13:43 --> 00:13:45
Well, there's a problem
with this conflict.

248
00:13:45 --> 00:13:49
OK, I'm going to have
a big fight with Dad.

249
00:13:49 --> 00:13:50
Dad.
 

250
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
Oh man, like Dad's really big.
 

251
00:13:53 --> 00:13:57
If Dad ever figures out that
I want to have a fight with

252
00:13:57 --> 00:13:59
him Dad is going to kill me.
 

253
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
Maybe he's going to
castrate me, I'm not sure.

254
00:14:01 --> 00:14:03
But it's something really,
really bad is going to happen

255
00:14:03 --> 00:14:09
here and so I better deny that
I was ever interested in this.

256
00:14:09 --> 00:14:13
In fact, what I'm going to
do is I'm going to reject,

257
00:14:13 --> 00:14:19
suppress my desire for Mom and
I'm going to idealize Dad.

258
00:14:19 --> 00:14:27
I'm going to come to take Dad,
in response to this perceived

259
00:14:27 --> 00:14:33
threat, perhaps to my very life
I'm going to idealize Dad.

260
00:14:33 --> 00:14:36
And in some sense
incorporate Dad into me.

261
00:14:36 --> 00:14:41
And that act of incorporation
is the beginnings of

262
00:14:41 --> 00:14:45
development of what Freud
called the superego.

263
00:14:45 --> 00:14:48
Another Latinization, this
time of a term that just

264
00:14:48 --> 00:14:50
means sort of over I.
 

265
00:14:50 --> 00:14:53
You know, the thing that
is above the self.

266
00:14:53 --> 00:14:57
It's not quite your conscience.
 

267
00:14:57 --> 00:15:01
It's not unrelated to your
conscience, but it initially

268
00:15:01 --> 00:15:05
for Freud starts out as the
voice of the father

269
00:15:05 --> 00:15:06
for a little boy.
 

270
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
Well, let's just say
voice of parent.

271
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
 
 

272
00:15:11 --> 00:15:18
And will eventually become the
voice of society as a whole

273
00:15:18 --> 00:15:21
telling you how to live.
 

274
00:15:21 --> 00:15:26
Not necessarily consciously,
not necessarily explicitly, but

275
00:15:26 --> 00:15:29
telling you what the rules are.
 

276
00:15:29 --> 00:15:34
Now again, you might think that
this whole business of a

277
00:15:34 --> 00:15:40
conflict with Daddy over Mommy
and the notion that you have

278
00:15:40 --> 00:15:43
some internalized voice of the
parent that is going to be sort

279
00:15:43 --> 00:15:46
of the roots of your morality,
your more sophisticated

280
00:15:46 --> 00:15:47
adult morality.
 

281
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
That that all sounds
a little strange.

282
00:15:49 --> 00:15:54
You can get a feeling for where
such thoughts might come from

283
00:15:54 --> 00:15:56
again, if you hang
around with kids.

284
00:15:56 --> 00:16:00
Remember last time we were
talking about you know,

285
00:16:00 --> 00:16:02
hugging your little brother
till he turns blue.

286
00:16:02 --> 00:16:08
Well look, I've now raised
three sons through the oedipal

287
00:16:08 --> 00:16:10
stage of development.
 

288
00:16:10 --> 00:16:15
I think every last one of them
at some point in the ages

289
00:16:15 --> 00:16:18
of around three, four the
appropriate Freudian age has

290
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
hopped into bed some Sunday
morning or something like

291
00:16:21 --> 00:16:25
that-- into our great, big,
huge, king-sized bed and

292
00:16:25 --> 00:16:28
asserted this bed isn't big
enough for the three of us.

293
00:16:28 --> 00:16:32
Why doesn't Daddy get out?
 

294
00:16:32 --> 00:16:35
And mostly what you're sitting
there thinking is, no kid

295
00:16:35 --> 00:16:36
should never be born
to a psychologist.

296
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
What's he doing, reading the
books on the side here?

297
00:16:39 --> 00:16:41
And then I thinking, what
am I supposed to do now?

298
00:16:41 --> 00:16:44
You know, am I suppose to like
threaten to kill them or

299
00:16:44 --> 00:16:47
something because that
develops morality?

300
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
 
 

301
00:16:50 --> 00:16:57
So you can really see these
sorts of seemingly oedipal

302
00:16:57 --> 00:17:02
comments in kids of that age
and you can also sometimes here

303
00:17:02 --> 00:17:08
this voice of the parent as it
gets internalized, like a

304
00:17:08 --> 00:17:16
little kid who's been told,
the cake's over here.

305
00:17:16 --> 00:17:18
It's for dinner,
don't mess with it.

306
00:17:18 --> 00:17:22
Don't go sticking your finger
in the chocolate icing again.

307
00:17:22 --> 00:17:27
So no, no, no, you
hear the kid say it.

308
00:17:27 --> 00:17:30
The nice thing about little
kids is that the superego

309
00:17:30 --> 00:17:35
will verbalize itself
for you-- no, no.

310
00:17:35 --> 00:17:38
 
 

311
00:17:38 --> 00:17:45
So the idea is that the stress
or the trauma of this oedipal

312
00:17:45 --> 00:17:50
conflict is what drives the
superego down into the psyche

313
00:17:50 --> 00:17:53
almost like a spike
from the outside.

314
00:17:53 --> 00:17:56
Well, I would be remiss if I
didn't say something about

315
00:17:56 --> 00:18:01
Freud's theory about how
this works out for women.

316
00:18:01 --> 00:18:04
Now I might be remiss, but you
wouldn't be missing anything in

317
00:18:04 --> 00:18:07
terms of-- people have all
sorts of problems with this

318
00:18:07 --> 00:18:09
oedipal theory business.
 

319
00:18:09 --> 00:18:12
Because for instance, what
happens if you get raised

320
00:18:12 --> 00:18:14
in a single-parent
family with just Mom?

321
00:18:14 --> 00:18:16
Is there any evidence that
your development comes

322
00:18:16 --> 00:18:17
out differently?
 

323
00:18:17 --> 00:18:19
No, in fact.
 

324
00:18:19 --> 00:18:21
So you don't need Dad there.
 

325
00:18:21 --> 00:18:23
You do need to figure out
what it means to be male.

326
00:18:23 --> 00:18:29
Let me say a quick word
about homosexuality.

327
00:18:29 --> 00:18:35
Freud regarded homosexuality
seemingly as a variant

328
00:18:35 --> 00:18:37
of an outcome to this.
 

329
00:18:37 --> 00:18:41
He did not seem to regard
it as a pathology.

330
00:18:41 --> 00:18:45
So he's got a very interesting
letter written to the

331
00:18:45 --> 00:18:48
mother of a gay man.
 

332
00:18:48 --> 00:18:50
The mother was worried about
this and he says basically,

333
00:18:50 --> 00:18:53
there's a bunch of
ways this plays out.

334
00:18:53 --> 00:18:58
The mainline one is in the
words of the old song you grow

335
00:18:58 --> 00:19:01
up to, I want a girl just like
the girl who married

336
00:19:01 --> 00:19:02
dear old Dad.
 

337
00:19:02 --> 00:19:05
That's the sort of
ultimate goal of this.

338
00:19:05 --> 00:19:08
In sort of the mainstream
version you reject your

339
00:19:08 --> 00:19:11
desire for Mom, you go
into this latent period.

340
00:19:11 --> 00:19:15
You go and you do math for
awhile and then you wake up as

341
00:19:15 --> 00:19:18
a sexually mature adult, not
looking for your mother, but

342
00:19:18 --> 00:19:23
looking for an appropriate
object of your desires.

343
00:19:23 --> 00:19:25
Freud thought that there were
other possible outcomes.

344
00:19:25 --> 00:19:27
That they were just
other possible outcome.

345
00:19:27 --> 00:19:32
Subsequent generations of
American psychology declared

346
00:19:32 --> 00:19:37
homosexuality to be a pathology
and it was only in the '70s

347
00:19:37 --> 00:19:42
that American psychology
returned in a sense to

348
00:19:42 --> 00:19:48
this view that it's a
variant, not a problem.

349
00:19:48 --> 00:19:49
So women-- how did
we get to women.

350
00:19:49 --> 00:19:51
What's the problem with women?
 

351
00:19:51 --> 00:19:56
The problem is you need the
same fight thought Freud.

352
00:19:56 --> 00:19:58
He's got himself sold
on this oedipal thing.

353
00:19:58 --> 00:20:00
And you need the same fight,
but now you need a fight

354
00:20:00 --> 00:20:05
between the daughter
and Mom for Dad.

355
00:20:05 --> 00:20:08
And the problem is that the
initial bonding of the

356
00:20:08 --> 00:20:10
daughter is also to Mom.
 

357
00:20:10 --> 00:20:14
So that's no good because you
can't fight with the person

358
00:20:14 --> 00:20:17
you're bonded too, so he's
got to get the bond to flip.

359
00:20:17 --> 00:20:22
And so he came up with one of
his less credible constructs--

360
00:20:22 --> 00:20:25
the one that even good
Freudians don't really believe

361
00:20:25 --> 00:20:27
in, which is penis envy.
 

362
00:20:27 --> 00:20:28
What is that?
 

363
00:20:28 --> 00:20:31
Well, he figured that little
girls at some point figured

364
00:20:31 --> 00:20:36
out that they did not have
something that little boys had,

365
00:20:36 --> 00:20:38
and that this was a disaster.
 

366
00:20:38 --> 00:20:40
This was very bad and they
figured out that Mom

367
00:20:40 --> 00:20:41
didn't have one either.
 

368
00:20:41 --> 00:20:44
And therefore, Mom was
defective and we ought

369
00:20:44 --> 00:20:47
to admire Dad instead.
 

370
00:20:47 --> 00:20:48
And then we can go
and fight with Mom.

371
00:20:48 --> 00:20:52
 
 

372
00:20:52 --> 00:20:54
This was traumatic,
this discovery.

373
00:20:54 --> 00:20:58
But it wasn't so traumatic, so
Freud also theorized that since

374
00:20:58 --> 00:21:01
it was that trauma that was
creating the superego and as a

375
00:21:01 --> 00:21:04
result, adult morality that
it followed that women were

376
00:21:04 --> 00:21:06
simply less moral than men.
 

377
00:21:06 --> 00:21:11
A conclusion born out anytime
you open the newspaper, right?

378
00:21:11 --> 00:21:14
It's not one of the more
successful pieces of Freud,

379
00:21:14 --> 00:21:18
but it is the source of
my favorite, really bad

380
00:21:18 --> 00:21:20
experiment in this realm.
 

381
00:21:20 --> 00:21:25
Which was an experiment where
somebody gave a paper and

382
00:21:25 --> 00:21:27
pencil test to a
group like you.

383
00:21:27 --> 00:21:29
One of these sort of SAT things
where you're filling in

384
00:21:29 --> 00:21:33
the little things with the
golf pencils and stuff.

385
00:21:33 --> 00:21:36
And then you hand the thing
back and the experimenters

386
00:21:36 --> 00:21:39
don't care a bit about
the test at all.

387
00:21:39 --> 00:21:43
All they care about is who
returned the little pencils.

388
00:21:43 --> 00:21:46
And more guys returned
the pencils than women.

389
00:21:46 --> 00:21:49
 
 

390
00:21:49 --> 00:21:53
Anyway, it's really lame.
 

391
00:21:53 --> 00:22:02
So look, the broad issue of
what does it mean to be a boy

392
00:22:02 --> 00:22:07
or a girl, a man or a woman--
who is going to turn out to

393
00:22:07 --> 00:22:11
be an appropriate object for
my sexual desire and so on?

394
00:22:11 --> 00:22:14
Those are interesting
questions.

395
00:22:14 --> 00:22:18
There is considerable question
about whether this actual

396
00:22:18 --> 00:22:22
oedipal conflict-- actually
there's very little doubt

397
00:22:22 --> 00:22:26
that the strict form
of it is not required.

398
00:22:26 --> 00:22:29
The single parent family
thing is one good bit of

399
00:22:29 --> 00:22:30
evidence against that.
 

400
00:22:30 --> 00:22:34
And the woman story--
it's just kind of whack.

401
00:22:34 --> 00:22:38
 
 

402
00:22:38 --> 00:22:45
In any case, around this time
you do get this development of

403
00:22:45 --> 00:22:49
a more sophisticated morality.
 

404
00:22:49 --> 00:22:54
And in Freud's view what you
had was this poor ego here that

405
00:22:54 --> 00:22:58
was on the one side, assailed
by the desires of the id that

406
00:22:58 --> 00:23:01
wanted to do all sorts of
unspeakable and stupid things

407
00:23:01 --> 00:23:04
that you couldn't do in the
face of reality and then

408
00:23:04 --> 00:23:08
there's the demands on the
other side of the superego

409
00:23:08 --> 00:23:11
mostly, that doesn't want
you to do stuff too.

410
00:23:11 --> 00:23:13
But anyway, it's got
its own demand.

411
00:23:13 --> 00:23:17
And the ego has to somehow
thread a path through here.

412
00:23:17 --> 00:23:21
Now how does the superego
let you know what

413
00:23:21 --> 00:23:24
you're supposed to do?
 

414
00:23:24 --> 00:23:25
Well, it says on the
handout, does it?

415
00:23:25 --> 00:23:27
Where'd I put it
on the handout?

416
00:23:27 --> 00:23:28
Oh, no, I put a blank.
 

417
00:23:28 --> 00:23:29
Look at that.
 

418
00:23:29 --> 00:23:36
The superego has a weapon that
lets you know when you've done

419
00:23:36 --> 00:23:39
what it does not approve of.
 

420
00:23:39 --> 00:23:43
To figure out what that weapon
is you can invoke your

421
00:23:43 --> 00:23:44
own introspection.
 

422
00:23:44 --> 00:23:49
What you need to do is imagine
some activity that your

423
00:23:49 --> 00:23:54
parents would disapprove of.
 

424
00:23:54 --> 00:23:57
It can be society as a whole if
you like, but parents will do.

425
00:23:57 --> 00:24:00
So think of something that your
parents would deeply disapprove

426
00:24:00 --> 00:24:04
of if you phoned up and
said, guess what I did.

427
00:24:04 --> 00:24:09
And ask yourself, how would
you feel the next day?

428
00:24:09 --> 00:24:12
 
 

429
00:24:12 --> 00:24:12
AUDIENCE: Guilty.
 

430
00:24:12 --> 00:24:13
PROFESSOR: Guilty, thank you.
 

431
00:24:13 --> 00:24:17
 
 

432
00:24:17 --> 00:24:22
Guilt is the weapon of the
superego in this view.

433
00:24:22 --> 00:24:26
So when you feel guilty a good
Freudian would say, you're

434
00:24:26 --> 00:24:29
feeling guilty because you've
done something that

435
00:24:29 --> 00:24:32
transgressed the boundaries
set by the superego.

436
00:24:32 --> 00:24:36
Now look, I went out and I
committed murder and I feel

437
00:24:36 --> 00:24:37
really bad about that.
 

438
00:24:37 --> 00:24:40
Yeah, all right that's not
too terribly interesting.

439
00:24:40 --> 00:24:42
The more interesting case
is where patients who

440
00:24:42 --> 00:24:44
said, I feel guilty.
 

441
00:24:44 --> 00:24:45
I don't really know why.
 

442
00:24:45 --> 00:24:49
I just feel this
sense of guilt.

443
00:24:49 --> 00:24:51
And a Freudian would
say, well look.

444
00:24:51 --> 00:24:55
This isn't all conscious stuff.
 

445
00:24:55 --> 00:24:59
You've apparently transgressed
some boundary that you don't

446
00:24:59 --> 00:25:02
quite recognize yourself
consciously, but it's there.

447
00:25:02 --> 00:25:05
 
 

448
00:25:05 --> 00:25:07
If you want to get over this
guilt we need to figure

449
00:25:07 --> 00:25:09
out what that problem is.
 

450
00:25:09 --> 00:25:13
Now, how many people here
enjoy feeling guilty?

451
00:25:13 --> 00:25:18
All right, so it follows that
the ego, which is not eager to

452
00:25:18 --> 00:25:21
sit around feeling guilty
is going to have some

453
00:25:21 --> 00:25:24
defense against that.
 

454
00:25:24 --> 00:25:27
So introspection oughta
work here, too.

455
00:25:27 --> 00:25:29
Let's go back to that,
whatever it was that you were

456
00:25:29 --> 00:25:33
going to do that would be
really, really wrong.

457
00:25:33 --> 00:25:37
Now let's suppose you
haven't done it yet.

458
00:25:37 --> 00:25:39
But you're going to do it.
 

459
00:25:39 --> 00:25:41
It's right over there.
 

460
00:25:41 --> 00:25:45
You can just go in and do it.
 

461
00:25:45 --> 00:25:49
How will you feel?
 

462
00:25:49 --> 00:25:51
AUDIENCE: Anxious.
 

463
00:25:51 --> 00:25:52
PROFESSOR: Anxious.
 

464
00:25:52 --> 00:25:53
I heard an anxious
over there somewhere.

465
00:25:53 --> 00:25:56
Thank you for the anxious,
wherever anxious is.

466
00:25:56 --> 00:26:05
Anxiety is considered to be the
defense mechanism of the ego

467
00:26:05 --> 00:26:10
against the predations
of the superego.

468
00:26:10 --> 00:26:16
So when you feel anxious in
this context the answer is

469
00:26:16 --> 00:26:18
well, you're pushing up against
something that the superego

470
00:26:18 --> 00:26:19
doesn't want you to do.
 

471
00:26:19 --> 00:26:22
 
 

472
00:26:22 --> 00:26:26
Now let's go back to the
case where I feel anxious,

473
00:26:26 --> 00:26:29
but I don't know why.
 

474
00:26:29 --> 00:26:35
Classic Freudian view would
have been there's some chunk

475
00:26:35 --> 00:26:38
of your superego that you're
getting close to there, it's

476
00:26:38 --> 00:26:43
rules and it's not
happy with you.

477
00:26:43 --> 00:26:48
Any reasonable more modern view
would include the possibility

478
00:26:48 --> 00:26:52
that you are just having an
anxiety attack that we might

479
00:26:52 --> 00:26:55
consider to be more biological
than psychological.

480
00:26:55 --> 00:26:59
That there are chunks of the
brain that if they are

481
00:26:59 --> 00:27:03
overactive-- the experience
is being anxious.

482
00:27:03 --> 00:27:07
If they're overactive for
essentially neurochemical

483
00:27:07 --> 00:27:11
reasons you may feel a sort of
a disembodied anxiety that's

484
00:27:11 --> 00:27:14
got nothing to do with whether
or not you're about to do

485
00:27:14 --> 00:27:18
something that Mother doesn't
approve of, but has everything

486
00:27:18 --> 00:27:22
to do with the balance
of your chemicals.

487
00:27:22 --> 00:27:28
The current position in the
pendulum that swings back and

488
00:27:28 --> 00:27:34
forth on how to handle
essentially psychiatric issues

489
00:27:34 --> 00:27:39
would be to treat free-floating
anxiety as essentially

490
00:27:39 --> 00:27:43
biological problem that we
might want to medicate.

491
00:27:43 --> 00:27:46
And we tend to undervalue the
possibility that you're feeling

492
00:27:46 --> 00:27:49
anxious for underlying
psychological rather

493
00:27:49 --> 00:27:52
than for underlying
neurochemical reasons.

494
00:27:52 --> 00:27:54
And of course, you can feel
anxious for things that don't

495
00:27:54 --> 00:27:57
have anything particular to do
with the superego or the

496
00:27:57 --> 00:28:01
imbalance of your
neurotransmitters.

497
00:28:01 --> 00:28:05
If I stand on the lectern
on one foot I might feel a

498
00:28:05 --> 00:28:08
certain amount of anxiety
for this because there's a

499
00:28:08 --> 00:28:12
straightforward threat
to my personal safety.

500
00:28:12 --> 00:28:17
So there are multiple roots
into anxiety, but within this

501
00:28:17 --> 00:28:23
context anxiety is the warning
sign that you are embarking on

502
00:28:23 --> 00:28:26
a course that mother would not
approve of or maybe dad

503
00:28:26 --> 00:28:30
or maybe the broader
society as a whole.

504
00:28:30 --> 00:28:40
So the result here for Freud is
that with this collection of

505
00:28:40 --> 00:28:43
psychological structures--
again, psychological

506
00:28:43 --> 00:28:44
structures, nobody thinks
you're going to go into it an

507
00:28:44 --> 00:28:49
MRI machine and find the
locus of the superego.

508
00:28:49 --> 00:28:53
But the result of this is
that we don't end up raping

509
00:28:53 --> 00:28:57
and pillaging our way
across the landscapes.

510
00:28:57 --> 00:29:00
We sublimate our aggressive
urges into things

511
00:29:00 --> 00:29:03
like sports or work.
 

512
00:29:03 --> 00:29:05
 
 

513
00:29:05 --> 00:29:12
The unbridled sexual desires of
the id get redirected into

514
00:29:12 --> 00:29:17
courtship or into literature or
into some other appropriate

515
00:29:17 --> 00:29:20
kind of realm.
 

516
00:29:20 --> 00:29:24
 
 

517
00:29:24 --> 00:29:27
From this Freud ends up
generalizing a theory of

518
00:29:27 --> 00:29:29
civilization as a whole.
 

519
00:29:29 --> 00:29:31
He wrote a very interesting
book late in his life called

520
00:29:31 --> 00:29:33
Civilization and
Its Discontents.

521
00:29:33 --> 00:29:35
Why its discontents?
 

522
00:29:35 --> 00:29:41
Freud believed that in order to
be civilized you were going

523
00:29:41 --> 00:29:47
to have to fight against
the desires of your id.

524
00:29:47 --> 00:29:49
Your id was going to be unhappy
with you and you were going to

525
00:29:49 --> 00:29:53
have to fight against the
whacko strictures of the

526
00:29:53 --> 00:29:55
superego, which were going to
be too strict for any normal

527
00:29:55 --> 00:29:57
person to hold onto.
 

528
00:29:57 --> 00:30:00
You were necessarily
going to be repressed,

529
00:30:00 --> 00:30:04
dissatisfied, and so on.
 

530
00:30:04 --> 00:30:08
That was the price you
paid for being civilized.

531
00:30:08 --> 00:30:12
Or one way to think about this,
one line from the book is that

532
00:30:12 --> 00:30:16
"the first man to hurl a
spear-- sorry, to hurl an

533
00:30:16 --> 00:30:21
insult rather than a spear is
the founder of civilization."

534
00:30:21 --> 00:30:25
The first man who can redirect
that sort of id like desire

535
00:30:25 --> 00:30:28
into something that's
consistent with maintaining a

536
00:30:28 --> 00:30:31
civilized world, that's where
you start to get the

537
00:30:31 --> 00:30:33
possibility of civilization.
 

538
00:30:33 --> 00:30:39
Now I recommend book to you in
part because some of it is

539
00:30:39 --> 00:30:44
extremely entertaining, for
all the wrong reasons.

540
00:30:44 --> 00:30:47
 
 

541
00:30:47 --> 00:30:50
As you may have gathered by
now, not all of Freud's

542
00:30:50 --> 00:30:53
detailed ideas have
stood the test of time.

543
00:30:53 --> 00:30:58
So I cannot resist the urge to
give you Freud's account of

544
00:30:58 --> 00:30:59
the domestication of fire.
 

545
00:30:59 --> 00:31:02
 
 

546
00:31:02 --> 00:31:05
Here's the problem
as Freud saw it.

547
00:31:05 --> 00:31:08
Fire happens out in the world.
 

548
00:31:08 --> 00:31:12
What did primitive man do when
he saw fire? says Freud.

549
00:31:12 --> 00:31:15
 
 

550
00:31:15 --> 00:31:17
AUDIENCE: Burned himself.
 

551
00:31:17 --> 00:31:17
PROFESSOR: Burned himself.
 

552
00:31:17 --> 00:31:20
Well, that would be
one possibility.

553
00:31:20 --> 00:31:23
Well, we can follow with this
line, if you weren't going to

554
00:31:23 --> 00:31:25
burn yourself, what might you
want to do to that fire?

555
00:31:25 --> 00:31:26
AUDIENCE: Put it out.
 

556
00:31:26 --> 00:31:27
PROFESSOR: Put it out.
 

557
00:31:27 --> 00:31:29
If you're a guy, how you
going to put it out?

558
00:31:29 --> 00:31:31
 
 

559
00:31:31 --> 00:31:32
AUDIENCE: Smack it.
 

560
00:31:32 --> 00:31:34
PROFESSOR: Smack it?
 

561
00:31:34 --> 00:31:37
No, that's if
you're a dumb guy.

562
00:31:37 --> 00:31:41
No, Freud proposed that
you would urinate on it.

563
00:31:41 --> 00:31:45
And that this was an
essentially sexual act--

564
00:31:45 --> 00:31:47
don't ask me why.
 

565
00:31:47 --> 00:31:52
But that the first man to
renounce that desire, that

566
00:31:52 --> 00:31:57
apparently id like desire to go
and urinate on fire-- he could

567
00:31:57 --> 00:32:00
bring the fire home and that
again, would be a building

568
00:32:00 --> 00:32:01
block of civilization.
 

569
00:32:01 --> 00:32:06
Not only that, said Freud, this
explains why in many cultures

570
00:32:06 --> 00:32:09
women are the keeper
of the hearth.

571
00:32:09 --> 00:32:11
Why is that?
 

572
00:32:11 --> 00:32:15
Well, it's a great deal more
difficult if you're a woman

573
00:32:15 --> 00:32:16
to urinate on the fire.
 

574
00:32:16 --> 00:32:19
It's just not going to
work out well for you.

575
00:32:19 --> 00:32:22
 
 

576
00:32:22 --> 00:32:26
No, you don't have
to believe that.

577
00:32:26 --> 00:32:29
It's on page 37 apparently
of my copy of Civilization

578
00:32:29 --> 00:32:30
and its Discontents.
 

579
00:32:30 --> 00:32:33
 
 

580
00:32:33 --> 00:32:36
I mean, the book is a beautiful
example of exactly why I think

581
00:32:36 --> 00:32:39
it's still worth
teaching Freud.

582
00:32:39 --> 00:32:42
There's a lot of whacko stuff
in there about peeing on the

583
00:32:42 --> 00:32:47
fire, but the broader, large
scale thought that repression

584
00:32:47 --> 00:32:55
of infantile urges is a price
that we pay for civilization

585
00:32:55 --> 00:32:59
is, it seems to me, a
worthwhile thought

586
00:32:59 --> 00:33:01
to rattle around.
 

587
00:33:01 --> 00:33:05
That as you become more
civilized in a sense, you end

588
00:33:05 --> 00:33:07
up becoming more repressed.
 

589
00:33:07 --> 00:33:09
 
 

590
00:33:09 --> 00:33:13
That the id's going to sit
there trying to escape and you

591
00:33:13 --> 00:33:18
fill more and more walls around
it and you live with more

592
00:33:18 --> 00:33:22
anxiety and more guilt as the
price for being in some

593
00:33:22 --> 00:33:24
sense more civilized.
 

594
00:33:24 --> 00:33:26
Now that's sort of a dark view.
 

595
00:33:26 --> 00:33:31
It's interesting that this
dark view crops up-- later

596
00:33:31 --> 00:33:35
in his life he had to flee
Austria from the Nazis.

597
00:33:35 --> 00:33:40
He was a sick and dying man
when he wrote Civilization

598
00:33:40 --> 00:33:41
and its Discontents.
 

599
00:33:41 --> 00:33:44
It's a rather dark
view of civilization.

600
00:33:44 --> 00:33:52
 
 

601
00:33:52 --> 00:33:56
Suppose this is all
true, in some fashion.

602
00:33:56 --> 00:33:59
Well, as it says on the
handout, how you going to talk

603
00:33:59 --> 00:34:01
to the children about this?
 

604
00:34:01 --> 00:34:04
If these are important issues
and your kid is hopping into

605
00:34:04 --> 00:34:09
bed with you and saying,
Daddy get out of bed.

606
00:34:09 --> 00:34:11
I want Mommy and
stuff like that.

607
00:34:11 --> 00:34:14
How do you talk to-- I'll
tell you how you don't

608
00:34:14 --> 00:34:14
talk to your kids.
 

609
00:34:14 --> 00:34:21
You don't say, I recognize that
at this stage in your life that

610
00:34:21 --> 00:34:25
you are thinking that you're in
conflict with me, but what you

611
00:34:25 --> 00:34:27
need to realize is that I'm
much bigger than you and if you

612
00:34:27 --> 00:34:31
pursue this much further--
see the scissors?

613
00:34:31 --> 00:34:34
You're in very big
trouble here.

614
00:34:34 --> 00:34:36
That's not a conversation
you want to have with

615
00:34:36 --> 00:34:38
a four year-old kid.
 

616
00:34:38 --> 00:34:40
Even if you're a psychologist.
 

617
00:34:40 --> 00:34:42
This is not a good idea.
 

618
00:34:42 --> 00:34:47
But you could imagine that
these issues, which not

619
00:34:47 --> 00:34:51
explicitly understood by
parents or children, but

620
00:34:51 --> 00:34:56
that these issues about,
is the world safe?

621
00:34:56 --> 00:34:57
Who runs the show?
 

622
00:34:57 --> 00:34:58
What am I?
 

623
00:34:58 --> 00:35:00
You know, these sort of issues
are issues that you're going

624
00:35:00 --> 00:35:03
to want to talk about.
 

625
00:35:03 --> 00:35:07
And if there's this sort of
psycho-sexual development thing

626
00:35:07 --> 00:35:11
running underneath it those are
the issues you're going to want

627
00:35:11 --> 00:35:14
to talk about in those terms.
 

628
00:35:14 --> 00:35:18
Bruno Bettelheim, following up
on ideas in Freud's own

629
00:35:18 --> 00:35:22
writings wrote a very
interesting book called The

630
00:35:22 --> 00:35:28
Uses of Enchantment in which he
argued that among other things,

631
00:35:28 --> 00:35:35
fairy tales or more precisely,
folk tales serve the role of a

632
00:35:35 --> 00:35:39
hidden language or a way to
talk into your children

633
00:35:39 --> 00:35:42
in hidden language
about these issues.

634
00:35:42 --> 00:35:44
Fairy tales is an English term.
 

635
00:35:44 --> 00:35:47
It's a little misleading
because fairy tales don't

636
00:35:47 --> 00:35:50
necessarily have fairies in
them, but folk tales is

637
00:35:50 --> 00:35:52
the more accurate term.
 

638
00:35:52 --> 00:35:57
So something like the Tales
of the Brothers Grimm, the

639
00:35:57 --> 00:36:01
brothers did not write those
stories, they collected them.

640
00:36:01 --> 00:36:03
They were early 19th century
anthropologists wandering

641
00:36:03 --> 00:36:08
around northern Germany getting
Grandma to tell them stories.

642
00:36:08 --> 00:36:11
And a folk tale is a story
that's not explicitly written

643
00:36:11 --> 00:36:14
down for literary purposes,
it's a story that has a grownup

644
00:36:14 --> 00:36:17
organically from parents
telling children and children

645
00:36:17 --> 00:36:20
saying, tell me the one about
the witch with the candy

646
00:36:20 --> 00:36:22
house and stuff like that.
 

647
00:36:22 --> 00:36:25
And these stories-- the good
ones-- get passed on and

648
00:36:25 --> 00:36:28
Bettelheim says the good ones
get passed on because they

649
00:36:28 --> 00:36:30
do this kind of work.
 

650
00:36:30 --> 00:36:39
They allow you to talk about
these kinds of issues.

651
00:36:39 --> 00:36:43
I see that I said, what are the
characteristics of fairy tales?

652
00:36:43 --> 00:36:46
So I better say a
word about that.

653
00:36:46 --> 00:36:51
Characters in fairy tales
are typically good or bad.

654
00:36:51 --> 00:36:55
You don't get-- in the
woods there was a witch.

655
00:36:55 --> 00:36:58
She wasn't really, like really
a horrible person, she was kind

656
00:36:58 --> 00:37:01
of misunderstood and she'd
been abused as a child.

657
00:37:01 --> 00:37:03
No, she's a bad witch.
 

658
00:37:03 --> 00:37:06
 
 

659
00:37:06 --> 00:37:10
And there was a boy.
 

660
00:37:10 --> 00:37:12
Very schematic chara--
oh, that's the second

661
00:37:12 --> 00:37:12
point actually.
 

662
00:37:12 --> 00:37:14
Very schematic characters
often with names like

663
00:37:14 --> 00:37:17
the boy, the girl.
 

664
00:37:17 --> 00:37:20
Or just a simple descriptor
like Snow White, which is

665
00:37:20 --> 00:37:22
just telling you something
about how she looks.

666
00:37:22 --> 00:37:27
 
 

667
00:37:27 --> 00:37:28
She's good, right?
 

668
00:37:28 --> 00:37:34
It's not that she's got issues
or something, she's good.

669
00:37:34 --> 00:37:38
And they're figures that a kid
could identify with typically.

670
00:37:38 --> 00:37:43
This is in contrast for
instance, to myth.

671
00:37:43 --> 00:37:46
Oedipus is not a folk
tale in this sense.

672
00:37:46 --> 00:37:51
You don't, at age four say, let
me tell you about this cool

673
00:37:51 --> 00:37:54
story where this guy goes off
and kills his dad and then

674
00:37:54 --> 00:37:56
marries his mom and he blinds
himself in the end,

675
00:37:56 --> 00:37:59
it's really neat.
 

676
00:37:59 --> 00:38:01
But you say, ooh,
that's really gross.

677
00:38:01 --> 00:38:04
But ask yourself-- we're going
to do Hansel and Gretel

678
00:38:04 --> 00:38:05
in a minute here.
 

679
00:38:05 --> 00:38:08
How many people know the
story of Hansel and Gretel?

680
00:38:08 --> 00:38:11
Think about Hansel and
Gretel in those terms.

681
00:38:11 --> 00:38:14
Or think about the
headlines, poverty parents

682
00:38:14 --> 00:38:17
ditch kids in wood.
 

683
00:38:17 --> 00:38:20
Girl, five, cooks
old lady in oven.

684
00:38:20 --> 00:38:25
I mean, this stuff is just as
gruesome in it's own way as

685
00:38:25 --> 00:38:28
king of Thebes finds out he's
married to Mom, blinds himself

686
00:38:28 --> 00:38:31
and wanders off into three
more plays by Sophocles.

687
00:38:31 --> 00:38:37
 
 

688
00:38:37 --> 00:38:42
It's not immediately obvious
that it's just grossness that

689
00:38:42 --> 00:38:46
somehow differentiates
myth and folk tale.

690
00:38:46 --> 00:38:49
But the characters are
typically something that a

691
00:38:49 --> 00:38:51
kid could identify with.
 

692
00:38:51 --> 00:38:54
They have optimistic endings,
that clearly distinguishes you

693
00:38:54 --> 00:38:57
from Greek tragedy or
something like that.

694
00:38:57 --> 00:39:03
At the end of a classic fairy
tale good things happen to

695
00:39:03 --> 00:39:05
good people and bad things
happen to bad people.

696
00:39:05 --> 00:39:08
Witches get killed.
 

697
00:39:08 --> 00:39:12
Good little girls and boys go
home and live happily ever

698
00:39:12 --> 00:39:14
after and stuff like that.
 

699
00:39:14 --> 00:39:17
But at the same time, while
they're optimistic in their

700
00:39:17 --> 00:39:21
ending they do not typically
have overt morals on them

701
00:39:21 --> 00:39:24
like Aesop's Fables or
something like that.

702
00:39:24 --> 00:39:28
You don't get fairy tales that
say, they came home after

703
00:39:28 --> 00:39:31
having cooked the witch and
they said, we'll never go into

704
00:39:31 --> 00:39:35
the woods again or eat any
candy, ever, ever, ever.

705
00:39:35 --> 00:39:37
It's good things happen to good
people, bad things happen

706
00:39:37 --> 00:39:39
to bad people and
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

707
00:39:39 --> 00:39:43
No overt punchline at the end.
 

708
00:39:43 --> 00:39:47
An important point is that even
if Bettelheim is correct, that

709
00:39:47 --> 00:39:50
these are somehow talking in
this sort of coded Freudian

710
00:39:50 --> 00:39:54
language, parents don't know
the language and kids don't

711
00:39:54 --> 00:39:58
know the language or don't know
that they're doing this all

712
00:39:58 --> 00:40:06
again, sort of implicitly
rather than explicitly.

713
00:40:06 --> 00:40:09
Nobody, except somebody who
took too many notes in Intro

714
00:40:09 --> 00:40:16
Psych says, let's see-- the
kid's three and he was making

715
00:40:16 --> 00:40:21
these cracks about the bed
and Dad and stuff like that.

716
00:40:21 --> 00:40:23
Let's see, I need an
oedipal fairy tale.

717
00:40:23 --> 00:40:27
Jack and the Beanstalk
that'll work tonight.

718
00:40:27 --> 00:40:31
But the notion is that the kid
will be requesting stories that

719
00:40:31 --> 00:40:34
address issues that he wants to
hear about and that the parents

720
00:40:34 --> 00:40:40
may find themselves choosing
stories to read or to tell that

721
00:40:40 --> 00:40:44
serve the issues that
are arising in their

722
00:40:44 --> 00:40:47
minds at the time.
 

723
00:40:47 --> 00:40:51
Now a lot of this has been
somewhat diluted in our era

724
00:40:51 --> 00:40:57
because we tend to read fairy
tales or watch them on videos

725
00:40:57 --> 00:41:01
where they have been turned
into literary constructs in

726
00:41:01 --> 00:41:04
ways that they weren't in
northern Germany in the 19th

727
00:41:04 --> 00:41:07
century or something like that.
 

728
00:41:07 --> 00:41:09
We'll talk a little later
about some of the ways that

729
00:41:09 --> 00:41:13
Disney has modified some
of the great fairy tales.

730
00:41:13 --> 00:41:17
They're wonderful things, but
Bettelheim is very mad about

731
00:41:17 --> 00:41:23
the ones where the revisions
that make nice at the end--

732
00:41:23 --> 00:41:27
Cinderella stories where you do
something nice to the step

733
00:41:27 --> 00:41:31
daughters, stepsisters-- you're
not supposed to do anything

734
00:41:31 --> 00:41:32
nice to the stepsisters.
 

735
00:41:32 --> 00:41:35
They're supposed to get their
eyes pecked out by crows

736
00:41:35 --> 00:41:40
because they're bad and bad
stuff happens to bad people.

737
00:41:40 --> 00:41:43
Cinderella isn't supposed to
arrange for them to mary some

738
00:41:43 --> 00:41:45
duke or something like that.
 

739
00:41:45 --> 00:41:48
That makes Bettelheim
very agitated.

740
00:41:48 --> 00:41:53
All right, let's talk
fairy tales here.

741
00:41:53 --> 00:42:03
So Hansel and Gretel is in this
way of thinking about things

742
00:42:03 --> 00:42:05
an oral stage fairy tale.
 

743
00:42:05 --> 00:42:09
Oh, let me say something
about that-- oral stage,

744
00:42:09 --> 00:42:11
that's like year one.
 

745
00:42:11 --> 00:42:14
And you're sitting there
saying, I like Hansel and

746
00:42:14 --> 00:42:19
Gretel, does that mean I never
got out of the oral stage?

747
00:42:19 --> 00:42:19
No.
 

748
00:42:19 --> 00:42:23
Remember the idea here is that
the issues that arise in the

749
00:42:23 --> 00:42:27
oral stage about, is the world
a safe place, for instance,

750
00:42:27 --> 00:42:29
are issues that will persist
for the rest of your life.

751
00:42:29 --> 00:42:33
So you're a seven year-old kid
in this view or something

752
00:42:33 --> 00:42:36
having a certain amount of
concern about whether the world

753
00:42:36 --> 00:42:38
is safe and if you walked down
the street to school you're

754
00:42:38 --> 00:42:40
going to get hit by a car
or something like that.

755
00:42:40 --> 00:42:46
And maybe Hansel and Gretel
would appeal on those terms.

756
00:42:46 --> 00:42:50
Another example would be,
Beauty and the Beast.

757
00:42:50 --> 00:42:55
A female oedipal story, we will
see, if and when I get to it.

758
00:42:55 --> 00:42:58
You're saying, I'm a guy.
 

759
00:42:58 --> 00:42:58
I'm a guy.
 

760
00:42:58 --> 00:43:01
I like Beauty and the Beast.
 

761
00:43:01 --> 00:43:03
Is this a problem?
 

762
00:43:03 --> 00:43:04
No.
 

763
00:43:04 --> 00:43:07
Part of this is not only do you
have to figure out what it

764
00:43:07 --> 00:43:09
means to be a guy, you also
have to figure out what

765
00:43:09 --> 00:43:09
it means to be a woman.
 

766
00:43:09 --> 00:43:12
You don't happen to be a woman,
but it would be really

767
00:43:12 --> 00:43:14
interesting to understand
what it might mean.

768
00:43:14 --> 00:43:18
And so again, you might be
interested in that particular

769
00:43:18 --> 00:43:24
story not because some strange
path is going on

770
00:43:24 --> 00:43:25
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].
 

771
00:43:25 --> 00:43:26
These are interesting
questions.

772
00:43:26 --> 00:43:29
 
 

773
00:43:29 --> 00:43:30
Hansel and Gretel.
 

774
00:43:30 --> 00:43:34
 
 

775
00:43:34 --> 00:43:35
Let's step back.
 

776
00:43:35 --> 00:43:37
What's the family
situation here?

777
00:43:37 --> 00:43:39
Who we got at the characters
in Hansel and Gretel?

778
00:43:39 --> 00:43:41
Well, there's
Hansel and Gretel.

779
00:43:41 --> 00:43:42
Who else do we have?
 

780
00:43:42 --> 00:43:42
AUDIENCE: Father.
 

781
00:43:42 --> 00:43:43
PROFESSOR: Father and?
 

782
00:43:43 --> 00:43:45
AUDIENCE: The mother.
 

783
00:43:45 --> 00:43:46
PROFESSOR: The mother?
 

784
00:43:46 --> 00:43:47
AUDIENCE: Stepmother.
 

785
00:43:47 --> 00:43:49
PROFESSOR: The stepmother.
 

786
00:43:49 --> 00:43:50
She a good stepmother?
 

787
00:43:50 --> 00:43:51
AUDIENCE: No.
 

788
00:43:51 --> 00:43:52
PROFESSOR: Or a bad stepmother?
 

789
00:43:52 --> 00:43:56
There are an awful lot of bad
stepmothers in fairy tales.

790
00:43:56 --> 00:43:58
Now that's a little mysterious.
 

791
00:43:58 --> 00:44:01
There are a couple of
ways to understand this.

792
00:44:01 --> 00:44:06
That one of them is to say that
in the days when childbirth was

793
00:44:06 --> 00:44:11
a much riskier proposition many
more people had stepmothers

794
00:44:11 --> 00:44:13
because Mom had died
in childbirth.

795
00:44:13 --> 00:44:16
As indeed happens in any
number of fairy stories.

796
00:44:16 --> 00:44:19
And in fact, you can come up
with an evolutionary psych

797
00:44:19 --> 00:44:23
argument that says that the
stepmother that systematically

798
00:44:23 --> 00:44:31
favors her own genetic children
over the step- children, but

799
00:44:31 --> 00:44:33
that's not the Freudian
account here.

800
00:44:33 --> 00:44:37
The Freudian account is look,
the initial mother who you

801
00:44:37 --> 00:44:42
encounter when you're a baby
is a really good mommy.

802
00:44:42 --> 00:44:48
She does everything for you and
she says yes all the time.

803
00:44:48 --> 00:44:49
You cry, she jumps.
 

804
00:44:49 --> 00:44:51
It's great.
 

805
00:44:51 --> 00:44:56
Eventually Mom gets tired of
this and Mom starts saying no

806
00:44:56 --> 00:44:59
and Mom starts saying things
like it's time to go poop in

807
00:44:59 --> 00:45:03
the bucket and not in your
pants and all this other stuff.

808
00:45:03 --> 00:45:10
And that, in this view is the
transition between good Mommy

809
00:45:10 --> 00:45:13
and bad Mommy and there are so
many fairy tales where you get

810
00:45:13 --> 00:45:18
born to a good mommy and then
the bad mommy shows up.

811
00:45:18 --> 00:45:22
Way outside of the range
of what would be probable

812
00:45:22 --> 00:45:24
in the population.
 

813
00:45:24 --> 00:45:28
That you can imagine that it's
a stand-in for something else.

814
00:45:28 --> 00:45:31
Maybe for a stand-in that
you're coming out of this

815
00:45:31 --> 00:45:35
oral stage of development
in this story.

816
00:45:35 --> 00:45:39
All right, so what's the
problem that's faced by our

817
00:45:39 --> 00:45:42
lovely little family unit?
 

818
00:45:42 --> 00:45:45
What's the issue here?
 

819
00:45:45 --> 00:45:46
AUDIENCE: Poor.
 

820
00:45:46 --> 00:45:46
PROFESSOR: Poor.
 

821
00:45:46 --> 00:45:50
We're out of money, so what's
the specific result of

822
00:45:50 --> 00:45:51
being out of money?
 

823
00:45:51 --> 00:45:53
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

824
00:45:53 --> 00:45:56
PROFESSOR: A few hands would
be handy rather than the

825
00:45:56 --> 00:45:58
general purpose muttering.
 

826
00:45:58 --> 00:45:59
No?
 

827
00:45:59 --> 00:45:59
We've scared them off.
 

828
00:45:59 --> 00:46:03
What have we run out of here?
 

829
00:46:03 --> 00:46:03
Food.
 

830
00:46:03 --> 00:46:06
We don't have any food.
 

831
00:46:06 --> 00:46:08
The natural thing to do
when you've run out

832
00:46:08 --> 00:46:10
of food is do what?
 

833
00:46:10 --> 00:46:11
AUDIENCE: Gather some.
 

834
00:46:11 --> 00:46:12
PROFESSOR: Gather some.
 

835
00:46:12 --> 00:46:13
Well, that didn't work
apparently or at least that

836
00:46:13 --> 00:46:15
was a really boring story.
 

837
00:46:15 --> 00:46:18
You know, once upon a time
there was a mother, a father,

838
00:46:18 --> 00:46:21
and a little boy and girl and
they got hungry and they went

839
00:46:21 --> 00:46:24
in a field and they gathered
mushrooms and unfortunately

840
00:46:24 --> 00:46:25
they were poisonous
and they all died.

841
00:46:25 --> 00:46:28
 
 

842
00:46:28 --> 00:46:30
That was one of those stores
that didn't get repeated.

843
00:46:30 --> 00:46:34
You know, tell me the story
about the poison-- no.

844
00:46:34 --> 00:46:37
So what happens in
Hansel and Gretel?

845
00:46:37 --> 00:46:39
AUDIENCE: Get rid of the kids.
 

846
00:46:39 --> 00:46:40
PROFESSOR: You get
rid of the kids.

847
00:46:40 --> 00:46:43
You stick the kids
out in the woods.

848
00:46:43 --> 00:46:46
But Hansel hears the plan,
mom and dad are busy

849
00:46:46 --> 00:46:50
discussing this at night.
 

850
00:46:50 --> 00:46:52
Hansel hears about
it, he does what?

851
00:46:52 --> 00:46:53
AUDIENCE: Runs away.
 

852
00:46:53 --> 00:46:55
PROFESSOR: No, he
doesn't run away.

853
00:46:55 --> 00:46:57
That's the Russian version.
 

854
00:46:57 --> 00:46:59
AUDIENCE: Kills the parents.
 

855
00:46:59 --> 00:47:00
PROFESSOR: Kills
the parents, no.

856
00:47:00 --> 00:47:04
Wait a second guys, I thought
you said you knew this story.

857
00:47:04 --> 00:47:06
Let's get this straight.
 

858
00:47:06 --> 00:47:09
He goes out into the garden,
he collects a bunch

859
00:47:09 --> 00:47:10
of white stones.
 

860
00:47:10 --> 00:47:15
He leaves the white stones
behind as a trail and--

861
00:47:15 --> 00:47:15
AUDIENCE: Bread.
 

862
00:47:15 --> 00:47:16
AUDIENCE: Bread crumbs.
 

863
00:47:16 --> 00:47:20
PROFESSOR: No, that's
the second time.

864
00:47:20 --> 00:47:23
You guys are all going
to flunk the final.

865
00:47:23 --> 00:47:25
This is very bad.
 

866
00:47:25 --> 00:47:31
So first time it's white rocks
and when the moon rises

867
00:47:31 --> 00:47:33
so you can see the white
rocks, they come back.

868
00:47:33 --> 00:47:36
So you've got an
oral stage problem.

869
00:47:36 --> 00:47:39
There ain't no food.
 

870
00:47:39 --> 00:47:44
And the initial crisis where
the kids get left in the woods

871
00:47:44 --> 00:47:46
is met with a nonsolution.
 

872
00:47:46 --> 00:47:49
You just returned back
to the same situation.

873
00:47:49 --> 00:47:51
Second time, same thing.
 

874
00:47:51 --> 00:47:54
They get abandoned out in the
woods, but this time this nasty

875
00:47:54 --> 00:47:57
old Step-mom has been cagier
about it and locked Hansel in

876
00:47:57 --> 00:48:00
and all he's got is his bread.
 

877
00:48:00 --> 00:48:03
And so now he tries what you
can think of as an oral stage

878
00:48:03 --> 00:48:06
solution to an oral problem.
 

879
00:48:06 --> 00:48:09
He leaves this collection
of bread crumbs behind.

880
00:48:09 --> 00:48:13
Does an oral solution
solve this problem?

881
00:48:13 --> 00:48:13
Well, no.
 

882
00:48:13 --> 00:48:15
What happens to
the bread crumbs?

883
00:48:15 --> 00:48:16
AUDIENCE: The birds eat them.
 

884
00:48:16 --> 00:48:19
PROFESSOR: The birds eat the
bread crumbs, so there's

885
00:48:19 --> 00:48:19
no bread crumbs.
 

886
00:48:19 --> 00:48:24
And they wander around and they
fall asleep in the woods and

887
00:48:24 --> 00:48:27
there's a beautiful chorus in
the Engelbert Humperdinck opera

888
00:48:27 --> 00:48:30
which you should all hear
sometime-- gorgeous opera-- and

889
00:48:30 --> 00:48:32
Engelbert Humperdinck
really was his name.

890
00:48:32 --> 00:48:37
Very sad, but the
opera's lovely.

891
00:48:37 --> 00:48:39
Anyway, so the next
day they wake up.

892
00:48:39 --> 00:48:40
They're hopelessly lost.
 

893
00:48:40 --> 00:48:41
They wander around.
 

894
00:48:41 --> 00:48:43
They're hungry.
 

895
00:48:43 --> 00:48:47
They're not terribly
happy and they find?

896
00:48:47 --> 00:48:48
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
 

897
00:48:48 --> 00:48:49
PROFESSOR: The house, right.
 

898
00:48:49 --> 00:48:51
The house made of gingerbread
and candy and stuff like that.

899
00:48:51 --> 00:48:54
And so like all good little
kids what they do is engage

900
00:48:54 --> 00:48:55
in a little petty vandalism.
 

901
00:48:55 --> 00:48:59
 
 

902
00:48:59 --> 00:49:03
Gretel eats a window and Hansel
eats a hunk of the roof and

903
00:49:03 --> 00:49:07
then they hear this voice
saying, "Nibbling, nibbling

904
00:49:07 --> 00:49:12
like a mouse, who's that
nibbling at my house?" And they

905
00:49:12 --> 00:49:16
respond, "The wind, the wind
doth blow from the heavens

906
00:49:16 --> 00:49:21
to the earth below,"
which makes no sense.

907
00:49:21 --> 00:49:27
But anyway, so out comes the?
 

908
00:49:27 --> 00:49:27
AUDIENCE: Witch.
 

909
00:49:27 --> 00:49:29
PROFESSOR: How do you
know she's a witch?

910
00:49:29 --> 00:49:31
AUDIENCE: Because she's
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

911
00:49:31 --> 00:49:35
PROFESSOR: Now the way you know
she's a witch it says is

912
00:49:35 --> 00:49:38
because her eyes glow red.
 

913
00:49:38 --> 00:49:41
This is a tip-off in
case-- this is practical

914
00:49:41 --> 00:49:41
advice for you.
 

915
00:49:41 --> 00:49:46
If you're vandalizing
somebody's house and the owner

916
00:49:46 --> 00:49:50
comes out and her eyes are
glowing red, worry about it.

917
00:49:50 --> 00:49:53
But that this means that
witches don't see very well,

918
00:49:53 --> 00:49:54
which turns out to be handy.
 

919
00:49:54 --> 00:49:56
They have keen senses
of smell we're told.

920
00:49:56 --> 00:50:00
Anyway, this witch-- now the
interesting thing about these

921
00:50:00 --> 00:50:05
fairy tales is that you have a
problem at home and then you

922
00:50:05 --> 00:50:09
are thrust out into-- well, in
the north German versions of

923
00:50:09 --> 00:50:12
the Grimm fairy tales are
into the woods to solve it.

924
00:50:12 --> 00:50:16
Somebody will have to tell me
what you do if you're reading

925
00:50:16 --> 00:50:18
Saudi Arabian fairy tales
whether you get thrust

926
00:50:18 --> 00:50:21
out into the dunes or
something like that.

927
00:50:21 --> 00:50:25
But the important thing is you
go out away from-- you don't

928
00:50:25 --> 00:50:29
solve your problem where it is
in these stories typically.

929
00:50:29 --> 00:50:33
You out and away and what you
find out there in story after

930
00:50:33 --> 00:50:38
story is a charicature--
an extreme version of

931
00:50:38 --> 00:50:40
the problem at home.
 

932
00:50:40 --> 00:50:42
So here we've got
an oral problem.

933
00:50:42 --> 00:50:45
There isn't enough food or
perhaps, if we're thinking in

934
00:50:45 --> 00:50:49
infantile terms, where's the
food come from if

935
00:50:49 --> 00:50:50
you're an infant?
 

936
00:50:50 --> 00:50:52
Well, it comes from Mom.
 

937
00:50:52 --> 00:50:56
So not enough food means you've
kind of eaten all that you can

938
00:50:56 --> 00:50:59
eat off of Mom and you might
worry, what's going to happen

939
00:50:59 --> 00:51:00
if Mom wants this back?
 

940
00:51:00 --> 00:51:04
Well, what you find in the
woods is this orality gone

941
00:51:04 --> 00:51:08
nuts because what this witch
does is eats little kids.

942
00:51:08 --> 00:51:10
That's her stock and trade.
 

943
00:51:10 --> 00:51:13
And she's going to eat Hansel,
but it turns out he's

944
00:51:13 --> 00:51:14
too skinny for her.
 

945
00:51:14 --> 00:51:18
So there's this
fattening up period.

946
00:51:18 --> 00:51:26
Eventually, it's cooking day
and the witch says to Gretel,

947
00:51:26 --> 00:51:29
climb into the oven and see if
it's warm because we're

948
00:51:29 --> 00:51:31
baking bread-- haha.
 

949
00:51:31 --> 00:51:34
Climb into the oven and Gretel
who's onto this says, I

950
00:51:34 --> 00:51:37
don't think I can do that.
 

951
00:51:37 --> 00:51:38
Can you show me how?
 

952
00:51:38 --> 00:51:40
And the witch says something
like, you silly goose.

953
00:51:40 --> 00:51:41
Anybody can do that.
 

954
00:51:41 --> 00:51:44
And she climbs up to the oven
and Gretel slams the door on

955
00:51:44 --> 00:51:49
her and she perishes horribly,
making loud screams.

956
00:51:49 --> 00:51:53
Which, not much better than
blinding yourself and

957
00:51:53 --> 00:51:54
things like that.
 

958
00:51:54 --> 00:51:57
But is deeply satisfying
in this story.

959
00:51:57 --> 00:51:59
 
 

960
00:51:59 --> 00:52:05
So now they've killed off this
symbol of orality and there

961
00:52:05 --> 00:52:08
are two important things
that happen thereafter.

962
00:52:08 --> 00:52:13
First of all, what they now
discover is that the house

963
00:52:13 --> 00:52:15
is full of gold and jewels.
 

964
00:52:15 --> 00:52:18
And they stuff their-- there's
a little more looting going on

965
00:52:18 --> 00:52:22
here-- but they stuff their
pockets not with candy, not

966
00:52:22 --> 00:52:26
with more oral solution kind of
stuff, but now with something

967
00:52:26 --> 00:52:29
that allows them to go
home and have moved

968
00:52:29 --> 00:52:30
to a different stage.
 

969
00:52:30 --> 00:52:32
A stage, where in principle
they can be contributors,

970
00:52:32 --> 00:52:35
not just consumers.
 

971
00:52:35 --> 00:52:38
This isn't supposed to be
an accurate model of what

972
00:52:38 --> 00:52:41
happens-- one year-old kid
moving out of the oral stage.

973
00:52:41 --> 00:52:44
Oral stage kid doesn't suddenly
say at the end of a year OK

974
00:52:44 --> 00:52:48
look, like I'm weaned and now
I'm going to go do chores.

975
00:52:48 --> 00:52:51
You've got to understand this
in a little more symbolic way.

976
00:52:51 --> 00:52:53
 
 

977
00:52:53 --> 00:52:56
Rather than an oral solution
we've got a different

978
00:52:56 --> 00:52:57
kind of solution.
 

979
00:52:57 --> 00:53:00
The other thing that's very
emblematic here is what

980
00:53:00 --> 00:53:02
do the children find
when they get home?

981
00:53:02 --> 00:53:04
Anybody remember?
 

982
00:53:04 --> 00:53:05
AUDIENCE: The
stepmother is dead.

983
00:53:05 --> 00:53:06
PROFESSOR: The
stepmother is dead.

984
00:53:06 --> 00:53:10
Presumably, the stepmother is
dead at the instant that the

985
00:53:10 --> 00:53:12
witch is killed because
they're in a sense, one

986
00:53:12 --> 00:53:13
and the same character.
 

987
00:53:13 --> 00:53:16
 
 

988
00:53:16 --> 00:53:17
They are the problem.
 

989
00:53:17 --> 00:53:20
They are the emblem of
this oral stage problem.

990
00:53:20 --> 00:53:26
It gets killed off and
everybody's good.

991
00:53:26 --> 00:53:29
Well, I think before the break,
I'm going to skip the anal

992
00:53:29 --> 00:53:31
stage for the present.
 

993
00:53:31 --> 00:53:34
I promise to come back with
an anal stage fairy tale.

994
00:53:34 --> 00:53:38
But what I'm going to do before
the break is I'm going to skip

995
00:53:38 --> 00:53:46
to-- and there are lots of
oedipal stage fairy tales and I

996
00:53:46 --> 00:53:49
am going to use Jack and the
Beanstalk as an example of an

997
00:53:49 --> 00:53:53
early oedipal stage fairy tale.
 

998
00:53:53 --> 00:53:54
Jack and the Beanstalk.
 

999
00:53:54 --> 00:53:57
All right, let's do Jack
and the Beanstalk quickly.

1000
00:53:57 --> 00:54:00
Jack and the Beanstalk, what's
the crisis at the beginning?

1001
00:54:00 --> 00:54:02
 
 

1002
00:54:02 --> 00:54:04
What's Jack sent off to do?
 

1003
00:54:04 --> 00:54:05
AUDIENCE: Sell the cow.
 

1004
00:54:05 --> 00:54:06
PROFESSOR: Sell the cow.
 

1005
00:54:06 --> 00:54:08
Why are you selling the cow?
 

1006
00:54:08 --> 00:54:09
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].
 

1007
00:54:09 --> 00:54:11
PROFESSOR: It's not
giving milk anymore.

1008
00:54:11 --> 00:54:14
If you want a nice clear image
that you're out of the oral

1009
00:54:14 --> 00:54:19
stage, the cow having run
dry on you is pretty good.

1010
00:54:19 --> 00:54:23
So Jack's supposed to go off--
he's supposed to do the Hansel

1011
00:54:23 --> 00:54:23
and Gretel thing, right?
 

1012
00:54:23 --> 00:54:28
He's supposed to go from the
dried up cow thing and get some

1013
00:54:28 --> 00:54:32
money so we can go do the
food thing the other way.

1014
00:54:32 --> 00:54:33
But what's he do?
 

1015
00:54:33 --> 00:54:35
He trades it for...?
 

1016
00:54:35 --> 00:54:35
AUDIENCE: Magic beans.
 

1017
00:54:35 --> 00:54:38
PROFESSOR: Magic beans.
 

1018
00:54:38 --> 00:54:40
All right, he comes home.
 

1019
00:54:40 --> 00:54:41
Is Mom happy about this?
 

1020
00:54:41 --> 00:54:43
AUDIENCE: No.
 

1021
00:54:43 --> 00:54:44
PROFESSOR: No.
 

1022
00:54:44 --> 00:54:47
So what happens to Jack?
 

1023
00:54:47 --> 00:54:49
He gets sent to bed
without any supper.

1024
00:54:49 --> 00:54:53
Another sort of end of
oral stage kind of image.

1025
00:54:53 --> 00:54:55
And Mom does what
with the beans?

1026
00:54:55 --> 00:54:56
AUDIENCE: Throws them out.
 

1027
00:54:56 --> 00:54:58
PROFESSOR: Throws them out the
window or sows his wild oats

1028
00:54:58 --> 00:55:00
or something like that.
 

1029
00:55:00 --> 00:55:04
In any case, something
grows really big at

1030
00:55:04 --> 00:55:07
night in this story.
 

1031
00:55:07 --> 00:55:10
You don't have to be a vastly
Freudian imagination to think

1032
00:55:10 --> 00:55:13
that this looks a little
phallic here maybe.

1033
00:55:13 --> 00:55:16
Anyway, you wake up in
the morning and there's

1034
00:55:16 --> 00:55:20
this giant beanstalk.
 

1035
00:55:20 --> 00:55:21
Climbs up the beanstalk.
 

1036
00:55:21 --> 00:55:24
 
 

1037
00:55:24 --> 00:55:25
You climb up the beanstalk.
 

1038
00:55:25 --> 00:55:28
What do you find at the
top of the beanstalk?

1039
00:55:28 --> 00:55:29
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].
 

1040
00:55:29 --> 00:55:32
PROFESSOR: You find another--
just like in Hansel and Gretel

1041
00:55:32 --> 00:55:38
you find a cartoon version
of what was at home.

1042
00:55:38 --> 00:55:41
So you find the castle,
which is just the house

1043
00:55:41 --> 00:55:43
and who lives there?
 

1044
00:55:43 --> 00:55:43
AUDIENCE: Giant.
 

1045
00:55:43 --> 00:55:47
PROFESSOR: Well, who does he
find when he gets there first?

1046
00:55:47 --> 00:55:48
The giant's wife.
 

1047
00:55:48 --> 00:55:51
Or the ogre's wife who's
the stand-in for Mom.

1048
00:55:51 --> 00:55:53
Is she bad?
 

1049
00:55:53 --> 00:55:54
No, she's really very nice.
 

1050
00:55:54 --> 00:55:56
They have a very
nice relationship.

1051
00:55:56 --> 00:55:57
They're playing all day.
 

1052
00:55:57 --> 00:56:03
The problem is "Fee, fie,
fo, fum, I smell the

1053
00:56:03 --> 00:56:04
blood of an Englishman.
 

1054
00:56:04 --> 00:56:10
Be he alive or be he dead, I'll
grind his bones to make my

1055
00:56:10 --> 00:56:12
bread." Otherwise known
as Dad has come home.

1056
00:56:12 --> 00:56:17
 
 

1057
00:56:17 --> 00:56:20
One of the things that's sort
of interesting here is that

1058
00:56:20 --> 00:56:25
this models a classic sort of
nuclear family with a stay- at-

1059
00:56:25 --> 00:56:31
home mom that-- and you can
sort of imagine in the context

1060
00:56:31 --> 00:56:33
of this oedipal conflict.
 

1061
00:56:33 --> 00:56:34
So here's the son.
 

1062
00:56:34 --> 00:56:37
All day long he gets
to play with Mom.

1063
00:56:37 --> 00:56:38
You know Mom's cool.
 

1064
00:56:38 --> 00:56:39
Mom's great.
 

1065
00:56:39 --> 00:56:47
And then this ogre comes
home and he wants Mom

1066
00:56:47 --> 00:56:48
and he wants dinner.
 

1067
00:56:48 --> 00:56:50
And he wants to grind up little
kids and stuff like that.

1068
00:56:50 --> 00:56:57
A little strange, but it is an
image of the situation that a

1069
00:56:57 --> 00:56:59
young child might
find himself in.

1070
00:56:59 --> 00:57:04
Now you might wonder whether in
a few more generations our

1071
00:57:04 --> 00:57:11
fairy tales will have to change
in response to the-- in my

1072
00:57:11 --> 00:57:18
family both of us were out
of the house working.

1073
00:57:18 --> 00:57:21
So the nice giantess
at home model isn't

1074
00:57:21 --> 00:57:22
going to quite work.
 

1075
00:57:22 --> 00:57:27
You sort of wonder whether or
not in a few years, a few

1076
00:57:27 --> 00:57:31
generations or something, Jack
will be there with the nice

1077
00:57:31 --> 00:57:35
daycare provider or something
like that and the mom and

1078
00:57:35 --> 00:57:39
dad giants will come home
at the end of the day.

1079
00:57:39 --> 00:57:43
Fee, fie, fo, fum, let's
microwave the little bum

1080
00:57:43 --> 00:57:47
or something like that.
 

1081
00:57:47 --> 00:57:49
 
 

1082
00:57:49 --> 00:57:53
But in this version
you got Dad.

1083
00:57:53 --> 00:57:58
He comes home and-- the
dad's stand-in and so

1084
00:57:58 --> 00:58:01
what does Jack do?
 

1085
00:58:01 --> 00:58:04
Well, first of all, the mother
hides him in the oven, which is

1086
00:58:04 --> 00:58:07
a sort of womb-like symbol,
which is rather nice.

1087
00:58:07 --> 00:58:09
But he goes out and
steals stuff from

1088
00:58:09 --> 00:58:12
Dad-- from the giant.
 

1089
00:58:12 --> 00:58:15
He spends all of time ripping
Dad off here and basically

1090
00:58:15 --> 00:58:16
being in conflict with Dad.
 

1091
00:58:16 --> 00:58:21
Eventually he tries to steal
Dad's golden harp, which is

1092
00:58:21 --> 00:58:24
bad because the thing
makes a racket.

1093
00:58:24 --> 00:58:27
He got the goose out of
there without the problem.

1094
00:58:27 --> 00:58:30
Goose that lays that golden
eggs-- good thing to steal.

1095
00:58:30 --> 00:58:32
Kept the goose quite, but
the harp made a noise.

1096
00:58:32 --> 00:58:36
Anyway, the giant catches
onto this and what's he do?

1097
00:58:36 --> 00:58:37
What's Jack do?
 

1098
00:58:37 --> 00:58:41
 
 

1099
00:58:41 --> 00:58:41
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].
 

1100
00:58:41 --> 00:58:44
PROFESSOR: Didn't
understand a word of that.

1101
00:58:44 --> 00:58:45
Where's Jack go?
 

1102
00:58:45 --> 00:58:46
AUDIENCE: Down.
 

1103
00:58:46 --> 00:58:46
PROFESSOR: Back down
the beanstalk.

1104
00:58:46 --> 00:58:48
What's he do with
the beanstalk?

1105
00:58:48 --> 00:58:49
AUDIENCE: Chops it down.
 

1106
00:58:49 --> 00:58:51
PROFESSOR: He chops it down.
 

1107
00:58:51 --> 00:58:54
It depends on the version --
either Dad crashes or the

1108
00:58:54 --> 00:58:55
giant crashed or not.
 

1109
00:58:55 --> 00:59:02
But in any case, if this was a
full blast oedipal story you'd

1110
00:59:02 --> 00:59:05
be going [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

1111
00:59:05 --> 00:59:08
and get to the point where
you go off and for instance,

1112
00:59:08 --> 00:59:10
marry the princess or
something like that.

1113
00:59:10 --> 00:59:14
This is a partway oedipal--
not all the way through

1114
00:59:14 --> 00:59:15
the story-- thing.
 

1115
00:59:15 --> 00:59:18
You get that beanstalk
and you get rid of it.

1116
00:59:18 --> 00:59:20
Either it's sort of a
reversion back or it's

1117
00:59:20 --> 00:59:22
going into a latent period.
 

1118
00:59:22 --> 00:59:25
None of this stuff that grows
in the night-- nothing man,

1119
00:59:25 --> 00:59:27
we're done with that
for the time being.

1120
00:59:27 --> 00:59:29
Nothing good happens here.
 

1121
00:59:29 --> 00:59:33
Large, big guys chase me around
when I do anything of that and

1122
00:59:33 --> 00:59:36
forget it, so it's a story that
doesn't get all the way through

1123
00:59:36 --> 00:59:40
to the end of this whole
psycho-sexual story

1124
00:59:40 --> 00:59:44
that Freud's weaving.
 

1125
00:59:44 --> 00:59:48
So let's see here.
 

1126
00:59:48 --> 00:59:52
All right, I've already given
you a hint that classic male

1127
00:59:52 --> 00:59:56
oedipal stories are those
stories where you do end

1128
00:59:56 --> 00:59:57
up marrying the princess.
 

1129
00:59:57 --> 00:59:59
I'll say a bit more
about that in a minute.

1130
00:59:59 --> 01:00:02
But let's take a short break
because otherwise I'll never

1131
01:00:02 --> 01:00:02
get to the end of this.
 

1132
01:00:02 --> 01:00:22
 
 

1133
01:00:22 --> 01:00:23
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the final.
 

1134
01:00:23 --> 01:00:26
Can you put up some links for
me because I really don't

1135
01:00:26 --> 01:00:26
remember some of these stories.
 

1136
01:00:26 --> 01:00:29
PROFESSOR: Oh, don't worry.
 

1137
01:00:29 --> 01:00:32
No answer on the final would
require you to know the

1138
01:00:32 --> 01:00:35
details of the story.
 

1139
01:00:35 --> 01:00:38
And I hope I'm telling enough
of the story that you can get

1140
01:00:38 --> 01:00:40
the feeling for how it
maps back and forth

1141
01:00:40 --> 01:00:43
to the bits of Freud.
 

1142
01:00:43 --> 01:00:47
But if you happen to be fond
of fairy tale literature

1143
01:00:47 --> 01:00:50
the Bettelheim book is
a lot of fun to read.

1144
01:00:50 --> 01:00:53
 
 

1145
01:00:53 --> 01:00:55
I mean, it's now--
how old is it?

1146
01:00:55 --> 01:00:56
God, it's twenty-five
years old.

1147
01:00:56 --> 01:00:59
I read that sucker when it
came out the first time.

1148
01:00:59 --> 01:01:03
Anyway, I keep looking for
new stuff to read on it and

1149
01:01:03 --> 01:01:06
there's nothing as good.
 

1150
01:01:06 --> 01:01:27
It's fun to read.
 

1151
01:01:27 --> 01:01:30
 
 

1152
01:01:30 --> 01:01:38
In the full blast male version
oedipal fairy tales there and

1153
01:01:38 --> 01:01:41
endless ones of these and they
are of the form-- they're very

1154
01:01:41 --> 01:01:44
typically of the form--
the lead character is

1155
01:01:44 --> 01:01:46
typically somewhat older.
 

1156
01:01:46 --> 01:01:52
Often described as a prince
rather now than as a boy.

1157
01:01:52 --> 01:01:55
Rather than being like
abandoned in the woods, he is

1158
01:01:55 --> 01:02:00
now thrust out of doors by his
father for some crime or other.

1159
01:02:00 --> 01:02:02
He has to go out
into the world.

1160
01:02:02 --> 01:02:07
He's at home in this
oedipal conflict.

1161
01:02:07 --> 01:02:10
They reach the crisis in the
conflict and Dad literally

1162
01:02:10 --> 01:02:11
says, I'm going to kill you.
 

1163
01:02:11 --> 01:02:13
The kings says, I'm going to
kill you or something and he's

1164
01:02:13 --> 01:02:14
got to go out into the world.
 

1165
01:02:14 --> 01:02:17
And he goes out in the
world and has adventures.

1166
01:02:17 --> 01:02:21
What he does out in the world
in these stories is very

1167
01:02:21 --> 01:02:24
typically to kill a
stand-in for the father.

1168
01:02:24 --> 01:02:27
In Greek tragedy, you
may kill your father.

1169
01:02:27 --> 01:02:32
In a fairy tale you kill the
ogre the dragon, the giant--

1170
01:02:32 --> 01:02:37
something that stands in for
the father and the reason

1171
01:02:37 --> 01:02:40
you're doing this is because
the ogre, the giant, or the

1172
01:02:40 --> 01:02:44
dragon has in his
possession, what?

1173
01:02:44 --> 01:02:45
AUDIENCE: Princess.
 

1174
01:02:45 --> 01:02:46
PROFESSOR: A princess.
 

1175
01:02:46 --> 01:02:49
 
 

1176
01:02:49 --> 01:02:52
Almost always a princess who
thinks that the prince is

1177
01:02:52 --> 01:02:55
really quite nice and all that.
 

1178
01:02:55 --> 01:02:56
And not Mother.
 

1179
01:02:56 --> 01:03:01
You don't go out and rescue
your mother from the dragon.

1180
01:03:01 --> 01:03:03
It just doesn't happen.
 

1181
01:03:03 --> 01:03:05
What you're going to go out in
one of these stories and do

1182
01:03:05 --> 01:03:09
is find an appropriate mate.
 

1183
01:03:09 --> 01:03:13
Not the inappropriate oedipal
conflict stage mate.

1184
01:03:13 --> 01:03:16
You're going to go out and find
the princess, kill the dragon.

1185
01:03:16 --> 01:03:19
You're going to then bring
her home and everything

1186
01:03:19 --> 01:03:20
is going to be good.
 

1187
01:03:20 --> 01:03:22
And in fact, at this point
typically in one of these

1188
01:03:22 --> 01:03:28
stories the King will not
die, but will retire.

1189
01:03:28 --> 01:03:30
And Prince Charles in England
been waiting for this for

1190
01:03:30 --> 01:03:34
years, but it's never
worked out for him.

1191
01:03:34 --> 01:03:36
 
 

1192
01:03:36 --> 01:03:41
You come home with the right
princess and the King retires

1193
01:03:41 --> 01:03:42
and you get to rule the roost.
 

1194
01:03:42 --> 01:03:46
That's getting through all the
way to the end of the story.

1195
01:03:46 --> 01:03:55
Now female oedipal stories are
different in interesting ways

1196
01:03:55 --> 01:03:57
because of the difference
in the traditional

1197
01:03:57 --> 01:03:59
family structure.
 

1198
01:03:59 --> 01:04:05
If in a male structure you've
got the giant in Jack and the

1199
01:04:05 --> 01:04:08
Beanstalk who comes in only
intermittently because the

1200
01:04:08 --> 01:04:11
primary care-giver
is the mother.

1201
01:04:11 --> 01:04:16
The female's got the conflict
with the primary care-giver,

1202
01:04:16 --> 01:04:22
so you have in these sort of
stories the girls who are

1203
01:04:22 --> 01:04:29
captives of nasty, older women
in some fashion or other.

1204
01:04:29 --> 01:04:32
So let's look, for
instance, at Snow White.

1205
01:04:32 --> 01:04:34
Snow White, another one of
these names where the name

1206
01:04:34 --> 01:04:36
is just a generic term.
 

1207
01:04:36 --> 01:04:39
She's white as snow and
got hair as black as

1208
01:04:39 --> 01:04:40
coal or something.
 

1209
01:04:40 --> 01:04:41
I don't remember.
 

1210
01:04:41 --> 01:04:46
Anyway, lovely mother--
lovely mother dies.

1211
01:04:46 --> 01:04:54
The husband, the King remarries
another lovely woman,

1212
01:04:54 --> 01:04:55
but a very jealous one.
 

1213
01:04:55 --> 01:04:59
The jealous stepmother
has what cool device?

1214
01:04:59 --> 01:04:59
AUDIENCE: Mirror.
 

1215
01:04:59 --> 01:05:03
PROFESSOR: The mirror made
famous most recently

1216
01:05:03 --> 01:05:05
in Shrek endlessly.
 

1217
01:05:05 --> 01:05:12
And the cool thing about the
mirror in Snow White is it

1218
01:05:12 --> 01:05:15
speaks not literally, but
figuratively with the

1219
01:05:15 --> 01:05:17
voice of the little girl.
 

1220
01:05:17 --> 01:05:21
Initially, when the stepmother
asks, "Mirror, mirror on the

1221
01:05:21 --> 01:05:24
wall who's the fairest of us
all?" The mirror says, you.

1222
01:05:24 --> 01:05:25
It's you.
 

1223
01:05:25 --> 01:05:28
The voice of the little girl
saying, look, I idealize you.

1224
01:05:28 --> 01:05:29
You're my mother.
 

1225
01:05:29 --> 01:05:32
You're the greatest thing
since sliced bread.

1226
01:05:32 --> 01:05:35
Little later, "Mirror, mirror
on the wall who's the fairest

1227
01:05:35 --> 01:05:38
of us all?" Well look, Queenie,
you look pretty good for

1228
01:05:38 --> 01:05:43
a woman of your age, but
have you seen Snow White?

1229
01:05:43 --> 01:05:47
You know, she is a blossoming,
young woman here and hmmm--

1230
01:05:47 --> 01:05:51
well anyway, this drives the
nasty old stepmother nuts.

1231
01:05:51 --> 01:05:55
And in the best tradition of
oedipal stories she decides

1232
01:05:55 --> 01:05:58
to do what with Snow White?
 

1233
01:05:58 --> 01:06:02
Kill her.
 

1234
01:06:02 --> 01:06:05
Another characteristic of
female oedipal stories is

1235
01:06:05 --> 01:06:08
that the dad tends to either
be absent or useless.

1236
01:06:08 --> 01:06:09
The King does nothing here.
 

1237
01:06:09 --> 01:06:13
The other dad stand-in who's
the huntsman, who the Queen

1238
01:06:13 --> 01:06:17
gives Snow White to
to have her killed.

1239
01:06:17 --> 01:06:21
The huntsman fails both
the Queen and Snow White.

1240
01:06:21 --> 01:06:23
Disney's actually quite
close to the original

1241
01:06:23 --> 01:06:25
story in this one.
 

1242
01:06:25 --> 01:06:27
The huntsman takes her out into
the woods, doesn't have the

1243
01:06:27 --> 01:06:30
heart to kill her, but also
doesn't have the guts to save

1244
01:06:30 --> 01:06:34
her so loses her out in
the woods basically.

1245
01:06:34 --> 01:06:36
He goes off and kills what?
 

1246
01:06:36 --> 01:06:36
AUDIENCE: A deer.
 

1247
01:06:36 --> 01:06:37
PROFESSOR: A deer.
 

1248
01:06:37 --> 01:06:37
Does what?
 

1249
01:06:37 --> 01:06:39
AUDIENCE: Cuts out its heart.
 

1250
01:06:39 --> 01:06:40
PROFESSOR: Cuts out its heart.
 

1251
01:06:40 --> 01:06:42
Brings it home.
 

1252
01:06:42 --> 01:06:44
The Queen does what?
 

1253
01:06:44 --> 01:06:46
She eats it.
 

1254
01:06:46 --> 01:06:50
Nice woman.
 

1255
01:06:50 --> 01:06:55
Anyway, so she goes
off into the woods.

1256
01:06:55 --> 01:06:59
 
 

1257
01:06:59 --> 01:07:02
What does she find
out in the woods?

1258
01:07:02 --> 01:07:03
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

1259
01:07:03 --> 01:07:08
PROFESSOR: Hi ho, hi ho--
she finds a lovely little

1260
01:07:08 --> 01:07:12
encapsulated anal stage fairy
tale is what she finds.

1261
01:07:12 --> 01:07:19
 
 

1262
01:07:19 --> 01:07:22
The women will have some
intuition about this.

1263
01:07:22 --> 01:07:28
If you told your mother, Mom,
I found this really great

1264
01:07:28 --> 01:07:29
housing arrangement at MIT.
 

1265
01:07:29 --> 01:07:33
I'm going to go and live
with seven hairy guys.

1266
01:07:33 --> 01:07:34
Would mom be thrilled?
 

1267
01:07:34 --> 01:07:37
No, she would not be.
 

1268
01:07:37 --> 01:07:42
If however, they're the dwarves
from Snow White even though the

1269
01:07:42 --> 01:07:45
ones in Grimm aren't Sleepy and
Dopey and Whiffy and Waffy and

1270
01:07:45 --> 01:07:48
whatever they are in Disney--
you wouldn't worry about it

1271
01:07:48 --> 01:07:53
because these guys, they're
little asexual guys.

1272
01:07:53 --> 01:07:56
There is no sense of
threat here at all.

1273
01:07:56 --> 01:07:59
And what do they like to do?
 

1274
01:07:59 --> 01:08:01
They like to dig stuff
out of the dirt and put

1275
01:08:01 --> 01:08:01
stuff back in the dirt.
 

1276
01:08:01 --> 01:08:03
And dig stuff out of the
dirt and put stuff back.

1277
01:08:03 --> 01:08:06
And they're devoted to Snow
White, they think she's great.

1278
01:08:06 --> 01:08:11
But they're a little anal stage
fairy tale tucked in there.

1279
01:08:11 --> 01:08:15
And so the problem is that the
mirror rats out Snow White,

1280
01:08:15 --> 01:08:17
right? "Mirror, mirror on the
wall who's the fairest of us

1281
01:08:17 --> 01:08:19
all?" Yeah, yeah Queen
you look great.

1282
01:08:19 --> 01:08:24
Guess who's blossoming down in
the woods with a bunch of

1283
01:08:24 --> 01:08:26
little hairy asexual guys?
 

1284
01:08:26 --> 01:08:32
So she disguises herself, the
Queen disguises herself and

1285
01:08:32 --> 01:08:35
goes off in an effort
to kill Snow White.

1286
01:08:35 --> 01:08:41
She tries three different times
and they are interestingly

1287
01:08:41 --> 01:08:44
emblematic of an effort to keep
a girl from turning

1288
01:08:44 --> 01:08:45
into a woman.
 

1289
01:08:45 --> 01:08:49
The clearest one of these is
the corset that she sells-- she

1290
01:08:49 --> 01:08:55
goes as a peddler woman and
sells Snow White a corset that

1291
01:08:55 --> 01:08:59
squeezes her body back into a
little girl body so hard that

1292
01:08:59 --> 01:09:01
she can't breathe and
falls over dead.

1293
01:09:01 --> 01:09:04
Or semi-dead.
 

1294
01:09:04 --> 01:09:08
And always at the last
minute-- Hi ho, hi ho and

1295
01:09:08 --> 01:09:09
the dwarves come back.
 

1296
01:09:09 --> 01:09:10
She's dim.
 

1297
01:09:10 --> 01:09:14
You know, it's one of these
sort of fool me once shame on

1298
01:09:14 --> 01:09:16
me things, but three times
she goes and falls for

1299
01:09:16 --> 01:09:19
the old lady thing.
 

1300
01:09:19 --> 01:09:21
And the last time it's
with this Adam and

1301
01:09:21 --> 01:09:24
Eve kind of apple.
 

1302
01:09:24 --> 01:09:25
She eats the apple.
 

1303
01:09:25 --> 01:09:29
The dwarves come home and
she's dead and they can't

1304
01:09:29 --> 01:09:30
do anything about it.
 

1305
01:09:30 --> 01:09:33
Now what would the natural
thing be to do under

1306
01:09:33 --> 01:09:34
those circumstances?
 

1307
01:09:34 --> 01:09:36
Bury her, right?
 

1308
01:09:36 --> 01:09:37
Or something.
 

1309
01:09:37 --> 01:09:38
She's dead.
 

1310
01:09:38 --> 01:09:40
What do they do?
 

1311
01:09:40 --> 01:09:42
They put her in a glass coffin.
 

1312
01:09:42 --> 01:09:44
It says they can't
bear to bury her.

1313
01:09:44 --> 01:09:48
They put in a glass
coffin and put her in a

1314
01:09:48 --> 01:09:50
clearing in the woods.
 

1315
01:09:50 --> 01:09:55
 
 

1316
01:09:55 --> 01:09:58
And it says in the story that
she continues to grow into a

1317
01:09:58 --> 01:10:00
beautiful young woman, which
is a lovely image of a

1318
01:10:00 --> 01:10:02
latency stage, right.
 

1319
01:10:02 --> 01:10:05
Nothing's happening, but she's
turning into a sexually mature

1320
01:10:05 --> 01:10:07
woman is what's going on here.
 

1321
01:10:07 --> 01:10:10
You would think that the
dwarves might catch on.

1322
01:10:10 --> 01:10:14
There's something
weird here guys.

1323
01:10:14 --> 01:10:17
That normally the dead body
thing doesn't work like this.

1324
01:10:17 --> 01:10:20
But anyway, the dwarves don't--
she's getting beautiful and

1325
01:10:20 --> 01:10:22
through the woods comes the...?
 

1326
01:10:22 --> 01:10:22
AUDIENCE: Prince.
 

1327
01:10:22 --> 01:10:24
PROFESSOR: Prince.
 

1328
01:10:24 --> 01:10:26
The prince does what?
 

1329
01:10:26 --> 01:10:27
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

1330
01:10:27 --> 01:10:29
PROFESSOR: Nah, the
prince doesn't kiss her.

1331
01:10:29 --> 01:10:30
None of that stuff.
 

1332
01:10:30 --> 01:10:34
What the prince does-- I can't
remember if he does this in the

1333
01:10:34 --> 01:10:36
Disney version, but in the
traditional version the prince

1334
01:10:36 --> 01:10:41
orders the dwarves to bring
the coffin to his castle.

1335
01:10:41 --> 01:10:44
What is he thinking?
 

1336
01:10:44 --> 01:10:47
You know, this would be a
really cool coffee table?

1337
01:10:47 --> 01:10:52
It's very weird stuff.
 

1338
01:10:52 --> 01:10:56
But what happens is the dwarves
who have been extremely careful

1339
01:10:56 --> 01:11:04
all along-- the dwarves trip,
the coffin shatters and the

1340
01:11:04 --> 01:11:09
apple pops out of her throat
and she's alive, she's fine.

1341
01:11:09 --> 01:11:13
This is a story that doesn't
quite get all the way through

1342
01:11:13 --> 01:11:18
to adult sexuality in the sense
that the story ends without her

1343
01:11:18 --> 01:11:20
saying that she loves the
prince or anything like that.

1344
01:11:20 --> 01:11:23
It says, he was nice and
so she went with him.

1345
01:11:23 --> 01:11:27
It doesn't quite get you
all the way through.

1346
01:11:27 --> 01:11:30
The classic stories that get
you all the way through to the

1347
01:11:30 --> 01:11:35
end of the story on the female
side are the so-called

1348
01:11:35 --> 01:11:38
"animal groom" stories.
 

1349
01:11:38 --> 01:11:43
I don't have time to do Little
Red Riding Hood really.

1350
01:11:43 --> 01:11:47
But Little Red Riding Hood is
a story where all men are

1351
01:11:47 --> 01:11:51
beasts and they stay beasts.
 

1352
01:11:51 --> 01:11:54
The classic versions of female
oedipal stories that get you

1353
01:11:54 --> 01:11:58
all the way through to the end
of the story are the ones where

1354
01:11:58 --> 01:12:02
the beast is redeemed by
the love of a good woman.

1355
01:12:02 --> 01:12:05
You know, one class of these
is kiss the frog and it

1356
01:12:05 --> 01:12:06
turns into a prince.
 

1357
01:12:06 --> 01:12:09
But let's do Beauty
and the Beast.

1358
01:12:09 --> 01:12:12
Now Beauty and the Beast in the
Disney version is a wonderful

1359
01:12:12 --> 01:12:14
movie about female empowerment
or something like that, but

1360
01:12:14 --> 01:12:19
it's a long, long way from the
original folk tale version

1361
01:12:19 --> 01:12:21
of it, unlike the
Disney Snow White.

1362
01:12:21 --> 01:12:27
So let me tell you a little
more about the version that is

1363
01:12:27 --> 01:12:34
in Grimm's fairy tales-- if
you aren't familiar with it.

1364
01:12:34 --> 01:12:38
So in Grimm's fairy tales or in
the classic Beauty and the

1365
01:12:38 --> 01:12:44
Beast story for starters,
there's no reason why

1366
01:12:44 --> 01:12:47
the Beast is a beast.
 

1367
01:12:47 --> 01:12:51
In these stories typically, the
Beast in the Disney version is

1368
01:12:51 --> 01:12:57
a beast because he's got no
love and he was nasty to

1369
01:12:57 --> 01:12:59
whatever she was who showed
up at the door and

1370
01:12:59 --> 01:12:59
stuff like that.
 

1371
01:12:59 --> 01:13:01
None of that in the
traditional version.

1372
01:13:01 --> 01:13:06
He's a beast because some old
woman said, you're a beast.

1373
01:13:06 --> 01:13:11
In the all men are beasts
school of beasthood.

1374
01:13:11 --> 01:13:15
So when we start out with
Beauty and the Beast, Beauty is

1375
01:13:15 --> 01:13:18
at home with her two sisters.
 

1376
01:13:18 --> 01:13:23
No Mom onsite at all in this
one, but there's Dad and Dad's

1377
01:13:23 --> 01:13:25
going on off on a trip.
 

1378
01:13:25 --> 01:13:28
Not because he's got some
whacko cool invention, he's

1379
01:13:28 --> 01:13:30
just going on a trip and he
says, what do you want me to

1380
01:13:30 --> 01:13:35
bring back and one greedy, old
sister says, oh bring me a

1381
01:13:35 --> 01:13:39
Mercedes and the other one
says, bring me a fur coat and

1382
01:13:39 --> 01:13:44
Beauty who's a bit of a sap
says, just bring me one rose.

1383
01:13:44 --> 01:13:47
So anyway, he does well on the
trip and he gets the Mercedes

1384
01:13:47 --> 01:13:48
and gets the fur coat.
 

1385
01:13:48 --> 01:13:51
He forgets the rose, right?
 

1386
01:13:51 --> 01:13:57
So he's coming home and he
passes this ruinous castle and

1387
01:13:57 --> 01:14:00
there's a rosebush of course,
and he says, nobody's going

1388
01:14:00 --> 01:14:03
to miss one rose, right?
 

1389
01:14:03 --> 01:14:05
So he goes and picks the rose.
 

1390
01:14:05 --> 01:14:09
So bad move because out
comes [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1391
01:14:09 --> 01:14:14
And you picked my rose, now I'm
going to kill you which seems a

1392
01:14:14 --> 01:14:16
little disproportionate, but
you know, he's a

1393
01:14:16 --> 01:14:18
beast after all.
 

1394
01:14:18 --> 01:14:22
And so the daddy explains
way more than he should be

1395
01:14:22 --> 01:14:24
under the circumstances.
 

1396
01:14:24 --> 01:14:27
Oh, I was just picking one
for my daughter-- and

1397
01:14:27 --> 01:14:29
the beast says, OK.
 

1398
01:14:29 --> 01:14:30
Fine, I won't kill you.
 

1399
01:14:30 --> 01:14:32
Send me the daughter.
 

1400
01:14:32 --> 01:14:36
Dad says, OK.
 

1401
01:14:36 --> 01:14:38
There are two ways
of looking at this.

1402
01:14:38 --> 01:14:42
One of them is that dads very
traditionally, in animal groom

1403
01:14:42 --> 01:14:45
stories are the person who, in
a sense, walks the daughter

1404
01:14:45 --> 01:14:47
down the aisle here.
 

1405
01:14:47 --> 01:14:50
The other way of thinking about
this more charitably about Dad

1406
01:14:50 --> 01:14:53
is that Dad's thinking, I'm
just getting out of here man.

1407
01:14:53 --> 01:14:55
I'm not going to send
my daughter back.

1408
01:14:55 --> 01:14:57
But he goes home.
 

1409
01:14:57 --> 01:15:02
He tells the story and very
much like in the Disney

1410
01:15:02 --> 01:15:06
version Beauty says,
hey, you gave your word.

1411
01:15:06 --> 01:15:08
I gotta go.
 

1412
01:15:08 --> 01:15:12
And so she goes off to
live with the Beast.

1413
01:15:12 --> 01:15:17
Now the Beast-- well, he's
a beast, but he's kind

1414
01:15:17 --> 01:15:19
of like a gentleman.
 

1415
01:15:19 --> 01:15:21
He's not really a bad
beast as these things go.

1416
01:15:21 --> 01:15:24
They live a perfectly
reasonable life there

1417
01:15:24 --> 01:15:27
in this grungy castle.
 

1418
01:15:27 --> 01:15:32
Every night, after dinner
he says, will you kiss me

1419
01:15:32 --> 01:15:34
and she says, oh yuck.
 

1420
01:15:34 --> 01:15:35
You're a beast.
 

1421
01:15:35 --> 01:15:38
And he doesn't press
the issue, right?

1422
01:15:38 --> 01:15:41
And they just go on like
this for a long, long time.

1423
01:15:41 --> 01:15:47
And eventually she gets a
postcard or something-- no,

1424
01:15:47 --> 01:15:49
gets the wedding invitation.
 

1425
01:15:49 --> 01:15:52
She gets an invitation
that says, your sister's

1426
01:15:52 --> 01:15:52
getting married.
 

1427
01:15:52 --> 01:15:54
Why don't you come
home for the wedding?

1428
01:15:54 --> 01:15:58
And the Beast is reluctant to
let her go, but says, you can

1429
01:15:58 --> 01:16:05
go as long as you come back
within a month or I'll die.

1430
01:16:05 --> 01:16:09
So she goes home and big,
long party, I guess because

1431
01:16:09 --> 01:16:12
she forgets all about it.
 

1432
01:16:12 --> 01:16:16
The magic mirror in some
versions, but in any case, on

1433
01:16:16 --> 01:16:22
the thirty-first day she either
looks in the mirror or realizes

1434
01:16:22 --> 01:16:25
in a dream or something
that the Beast is dying.

1435
01:16:25 --> 01:16:26
The castle is in ruins.
 

1436
01:16:26 --> 01:16:28
The Beast is dying.
 

1437
01:16:28 --> 01:16:30
And she wishes
herself back there.

1438
01:16:30 --> 01:16:34
She's magically
transported back there.

1439
01:16:34 --> 01:16:37
Nobody gets to get killed
on the roof in the rain

1440
01:16:37 --> 01:16:38
or anything like that.
 

1441
01:16:38 --> 01:16:43
She realizes that she
does love this beast and

1442
01:16:43 --> 01:16:45
kisses him and kaboof!
 

1443
01:16:45 --> 01:16:50
Now he has been redeemed by
the love of a good woman

1444
01:16:50 --> 01:16:51
and he's no longer a beast.
 

1445
01:16:51 --> 01:16:58
You've gotten through all the
way to the end of the story.

1446
01:16:58 --> 01:17:01
So Little Red Riding Hood
there's no sense that she's

1447
01:17:01 --> 01:17:02
going to go marry the Beast.
 

1448
01:17:02 --> 01:17:05
In Little Red Riding Hood what
you've got is the situation

1449
01:17:05 --> 01:17:11
where Little Red Riding Hood
says to-- when confronted by

1450
01:17:11 --> 01:17:14
the Beast on the road in effect
she says, I'm much

1451
01:17:14 --> 01:17:15
too young for you.
 

1452
01:17:15 --> 01:17:18
I'm an inappropriate
sexual object.

1453
01:17:18 --> 01:17:20
Why don't you go see Grandma?
 

1454
01:17:20 --> 01:17:22
She's a much more
experienced woman.

1455
01:17:22 --> 01:17:26
 
 

1456
01:17:26 --> 01:17:28
Go read your Little Red
Riding Hood again.

1457
01:17:28 --> 01:17:31
Little Red Riding Hood gives
way too much-- if you go and

1458
01:17:31 --> 01:17:35
meet a stranger, a bad, scary
stranger and he asks a bunch of

1459
01:17:35 --> 01:17:39
questions you're not supposed
to say, I live or I'm

1460
01:17:39 --> 01:17:40
going to Grandma.
 

1461
01:17:40 --> 01:17:44
She lives at 400 Shady Brook
Lane and I think she leaves

1462
01:17:44 --> 01:17:46
the back door unlocked.
 

1463
01:17:46 --> 01:17:48
That's more or less what
Red Riding Hood does.

1464
01:17:48 --> 01:17:53
 
 

1465
01:17:53 --> 01:17:56
So what the Wolf does
is it goes there and

1466
01:17:56 --> 01:17:57
gobbles up Grandma.
 

1467
01:17:57 --> 01:18:04
Gets into bed and then gobbles
up Little Red Riding Hood.

1468
01:18:04 --> 01:18:09
Who is later delivered by
cesarean section, more or

1469
01:18:09 --> 01:18:14
less and describes the
whole experience as yucky.

1470
01:18:14 --> 01:18:14
Not scary.
 

1471
01:18:14 --> 01:18:16
It was all just sort gross.
 

1472
01:18:16 --> 01:18:19
 
 

1473
01:18:19 --> 01:18:25
And when the Wolf is captured
by the huntsman, Daddy,

1474
01:18:25 --> 01:18:28
the Wolf is described
as you old sinner.

1475
01:18:28 --> 01:18:29
What's that about?
 

1476
01:18:29 --> 01:18:32
Anyway, the Little Red Riding
Hood ends with Little Red

1477
01:18:32 --> 01:18:35
Riding Hood saying, I will
never go off the straight

1478
01:18:35 --> 01:18:36
and narrow again.
 

1479
01:18:36 --> 01:18:39
Because the Wolf's been
saying go smell the flowers.

1480
01:18:39 --> 01:18:41
Go off the track and
stuff like that.

1481
01:18:41 --> 01:18:43
So that's a story where
you don't get through

1482
01:18:43 --> 01:18:45
the whole thing.
 

1483
01:18:45 --> 01:18:48
If you wanted to write a Little
Red Riding Hood story-- you

1484
01:18:48 --> 01:18:52
wanted to morph it into a full
blast story-- I suppose it'd be

1485
01:18:52 --> 01:18:55
a little crass if Little Red
Riding Hood had to go and marry

1486
01:18:55 --> 01:18:57
the guy who killed Grandma.
 

1487
01:18:57 --> 01:19:00
That's a little gross, but
she'd end up kissing the Wolf

1488
01:19:00 --> 01:19:07
at the end and the Wolf would
turn into something nice.

1489
01:19:07 --> 01:19:11
There's a great MIT fairy
tale-- a tool and die fairy

1490
01:19:11 --> 01:19:14
tale, but you'll have to ask
me about it some other time.
