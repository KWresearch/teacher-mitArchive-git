Lecture 6 – Vision and Visual Perception 
Lecture 6 - Perception 
The abstract: You have a problem. The goal of vision is to provide you with a description of the
external world. However, the input to the visual system is the image that is formed on your retina. It
contains information about the world but it is not a simple copy of the world. You need to do a lot of
work to get from input to perception. Today, we will talk about several of the tasks that must be
accomplished. You need to distinguish between your motion and motion in the world. You need to
figure out how isolated bits of the image go together. You need to ignore irrelevant information (e.g. the
light sources). You need to infer the most probable world even though there is an infinity of possible
worlds that could produce the stimulus on the retina. 
Why is it hard to go from the retinal image to visual perception? Three example problems 
The input is a flat (2D) image but the world is 3D 
The input is an interaction of photons and photoreceptors.
You want to know the properties of surfaces. 
And the image is sliding around on a moving retina in a moving head 
Let start with that 
Task  1: Establishing  a  framework 
DEMO: retinal vs world orientation 
DEMO: moving the eye (efferent copy)

DEMO: VOR = Vestibular ocular reflex

The Dalmation Dog – You have all the features, now you need a theory

Task 2: What pieces go together? 
Joining line segments

Dealing with occlusion

Grouping: (sometimes called "Gestalt grouping rules")

Task  3: Finding Edges 
Why is there a problem? 
Why do you see contours that are not in the image?

(Called "Subjective" or "illusory"contours" 

Conclusion: You infer the presence of contours based on your implicit
understanding of the physics of the world 
Task  4:  "Discounting"  the  illuminant 
You (mostly) do not care about the light source 
BUT:  The retinal stimulus = surface reflectance X illumination

You want to get rid of illumination. 
SLIDE: Craik-O'Brien-Cornsweet Illusion 
SLIDEs: Adelson's cylinder 
SLIDES: Info from shadows (eg. Moony faces) 

Task 5: Making the best guesses you can make. 
One great example: How can you infer a 3D world from 2D input?

2)

3)

4)

5)

…. And a few others

In summary: 
For all of these topics, the hard work is in the details.

So, for example, how should you combine information from different sources?? 

And, if we have time, we will ask that question in the context of motion sickness.
If  we don't…ask me sometime. 
Questions to answer from Chapter Six: 

P205ff - Like the lecture, the book goes into detail about depth cues. You will want to be able to say

something intelligent about the difference between binocular and monocular cues (206).

P207 - and you will want to be able to describe a variety of depth cues

P210 - Why doesn't the world appear to jump when you move your eyes? 

P213 - What is a template theory of recognition and why is it wrong?

P215 - What is an illusory conjunction and why is it interesting? 

P216 - The topics of segmentation, figure/ground, and grouping are all part of the broader problem of

parsing the visual stimulus into objects. Be able to say something intelligent on that topic.

P220 - The book is quite taken with network models of recognition. That's nice….

P223 - What the book is calling the "active role of the perceiver" and "the logic  of perception" is

closely related to "unconscious inference" as discussed in lecture.

P225 - It would not hurt to know the distinction between "magno" and "parvo" cells in the early visual
system. 
P227 - What is the division between "what" and "where" pathways all about? 
P228 - What is the binding problem? 
P229 - 232 Covers some of the material from the lecture on attention. I like my story better. But I am
biased. 
P232ff - What is meant by a perceptual constancy? 
P234 - Ah ha, more unconscious inference. How is this related to the material back on p223ff? 
P236 - Seeing and knowing….now there is a vexed topic. The attention lecture should have convinced
you that a lot of what you think you are SEEING is really something you SAW (or attended to) some
moments in the past. Is that the same as KNOWING. Maybe, but if I close my eyes, I still KNOW that
my computer is in front of me. That KNOWING is clearly different than what I KNOW about the
computer when I have my eyes open but my attention is directed to my copy of Gleitman….Isn't it?
Tricky problem. 

Something to write about, #6:Bayesian Vision 

The  formal way  talk about making  inferences  in  vision  is  to  talk about making  statistical 
inferences using Bayes' Theorem  (or an approximation  to  it).  I am not going  to  tell you all 
about Bayes' Theorem because that would take me too long. My current favorite LONG 
d iscuss ion  is 

An  Intuitive Explanation of Bayesian Reasoning 
http://yudkowsky.net/bayes/bayes.html 
It is in the folder #6 BAYES THEOREM on the webpage BUT the applets didn't come with 
it. Try them on the web, 

Here are  four different articles using  this approach on different bits of vision. All are  in  the 
folder.  If you pick  this assignment, you  job  is  to explain  the Bayesian approach  in 
language  that would be accessible  to your grandmother, even  if she  is not a bio-
statistician.
