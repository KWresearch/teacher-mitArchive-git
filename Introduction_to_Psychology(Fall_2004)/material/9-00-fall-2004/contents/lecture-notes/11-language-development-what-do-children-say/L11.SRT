6
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
PROFESSOR: In the last lecture
I was talking about the fact

7
00:00:18 --> 00:00:26
that kids go through roughly
the stages of language

8
00:00:26 --> 00:00:27
development.
 

9
00:00:27 --> 00:00:31
They go through the same set of
language development stages.

10
00:00:31 --> 00:00:38
 
 

11
00:00:38 --> 00:00:39
A babbling sort of free
 

12
00:00:39 --> 00:00:42
verbal stage, one word,
two word, and then more

13
00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
than two word stages.
 

14
00:00:45 --> 00:00:48
The question we're left with at
the moment is well, what is it

15
00:00:48 --> 00:00:52
that they're actually learning
when they're learning language.

16
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
There's lots of stuff
that's got to be learned.

17
00:00:55 --> 00:00:58
One of the things that, it's on
the handout somewhere there as

18
00:00:58 --> 00:01:00
I recall, is they gotta do a
remarkable job of learning

19
00:01:00 --> 00:01:02
words and word meaning.
 

20
00:01:02 --> 00:01:07
Between about a year and a half
and six years of age, in order

21
00:01:07 --> 00:01:16
to account for the vocabulary
that a six year old has, you

22
00:01:16 --> 00:01:20
have to assume that children
are learning five to 10

23
00:01:20 --> 00:01:23
words a day, every day.
 

24
00:01:23 --> 00:01:27
So, that's a rate sort
of approaching a

25
00:01:27 --> 00:01:30
word an hour or so.
 

26
00:01:30 --> 00:01:32
They're not doing it
in school, right.

27
00:01:32 --> 00:01:34
It's not that they're going to
school and every day they're

28
00:01:34 --> 00:01:36
being handed long
vocabulary lists.

29
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
They're just picking
this stuff up.

30
00:01:38 --> 00:01:43
It's an amazing and not
trivial feat for figuring

31
00:01:43 --> 00:01:44
out how you do that.
 

32
00:01:44 --> 00:01:47
 
 

33
00:01:47 --> 00:01:52
Somebody says oh, look, there's
the chalk, and the kid not only

34
00:01:52 --> 00:01:57
has to learn this new word,
chalk, but has to figure out

35
00:01:57 --> 00:02:04
that it somehow refers to this
box of stuff, and not to the

36
00:02:04 --> 00:02:12
color yellow or to the letter c
or to the small boxes when Bush

37
00:02:12 --> 00:02:16
is president, or any of a vast
number of other possibilities.

38
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
It's a very daunting problem.
 

39
00:02:19 --> 00:02:22
I'm going to focus rother than
on the word meaning problem, on

40
00:02:22 --> 00:02:25
a different problem, which
is the problem of

41
00:02:25 --> 00:02:28
learning grammar.
 

42
00:02:28 --> 00:02:31
 
 

43
00:02:31 --> 00:02:35
There, there are sort of two
large scale classes of theory

44
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
that I have cartooned -- I
cartooned them on the board and

45
00:02:39 --> 00:02:45
described them on the handout
as the East coast view

46
00:02:45 --> 00:02:46
and the West coast view.
 

47
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
 
 

48
00:02:50 --> 00:02:51
The East coast view could
really be called the

49
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
MIT view originally.
 

50
00:02:53 --> 00:02:58
It really starts with people
like Chomsky here and is nicely

51
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
wrapped up in Steve Pinker's
book called The Language

52
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
Instinct, which if you turn out
to be interested in the topic

53
00:03:03 --> 00:03:06
of language and language
learning, I'd strongly

54
00:03:06 --> 00:03:07
recommend you read it.
 

55
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
Among other things, Pinker is
one of the better writers in

56
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
our field and it's a good read.
 

57
00:03:13 --> 00:03:16
 
 

58
00:03:16 --> 00:03:20
The West coast view was a
view you held by people like

59
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
Mark Seidenberg at UCLA.
 

60
00:03:22 --> 00:03:26
Well, Mark Seidenberg's now at
Minnesota, so this geographical

61
00:03:26 --> 00:03:29
thing doesn't work
so well anymore.

62
00:03:29 --> 00:03:30
Here the distinction.
 

63
00:03:30 --> 00:03:35
 
 

64
00:03:35 --> 00:03:36
Let's start with the
specific problem.

65
00:03:36 --> 00:03:41
Specific problem might be
something like, as it says on

66
00:03:41 --> 00:03:49
the handout, how do you make
the past tense in English?

67
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
You'd obviously have to learn
to make the past tense in some

68
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
other language if you were
going to learn yourself

69
00:03:54 --> 00:03:56
some other language.
 

70
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
But I walked to the store.
 

71
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
Yesterday I did what?
 

72
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
 

73
00:04:03 --> 00:04:07
PROFESSOR: I walked
to the store.

74
00:04:07 --> 00:04:14
Today I plan to go to the
airport, actually, right

75
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
after this lecture.
 

76
00:04:16 --> 00:04:17
Yesterday I did what?
 

77
00:04:17 --> 00:04:18
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
 

78
00:04:18 --> 00:04:20
PROFESSOR: All right.
 

79
00:04:20 --> 00:04:24
So, how do we go and make
the past tense in English?

80
00:04:24 --> 00:04:28
AUDIENCE: e-d.
 

81
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
PROFESSOR: Yeah, stick an e-d
on things most of the time,

82
00:04:31 --> 00:04:37
except today I'm going
to sing yesterday I--.

83
00:04:37 --> 00:04:37
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

84
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
I didn't singed.
 

85
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
Today we ring the
bell, yesterday--

86
00:04:42 --> 00:04:43
AUDIENCE: Rang.
 

87
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
PROFESSOR: We rang the bell, or
we rung the but -- no we didn't

88
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
rung the bell yesterday.
 

89
00:04:47 --> 00:04:50
The bell was rung yesterday,
but we rang it--.

90
00:04:50 --> 00:04:53
Anyway, it gets complicated.
 

91
00:04:53 --> 00:04:59
Today I bring you all this
information about language,

92
00:04:59 --> 00:05:00
and yesterday I--.
 

93
00:05:00 --> 00:05:01
AUDIENCE: Brought.
 

94
00:05:01 --> 00:05:04
PROFESSOR: Brought --
it's not even brang.

95
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
So the rule -- there's sort
of a sub sing-sang kind of

96
00:05:07 --> 00:05:10
rule, there's a bring-brang.
 

97
00:05:10 --> 00:05:11
No, brang doesn't work.
 

98
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
Brought.
 

99
00:05:13 --> 00:05:19
So, kids behave as thought
they have learned a rule

100
00:05:19 --> 00:05:22
and a set of exceptions.
 

101
00:05:22 --> 00:05:26
The East coast view of
this is that they really

102
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
have learned a rule.
 

103
00:05:28 --> 00:05:34
That somewhere deep in their
little brain, you could

104
00:05:34 --> 00:05:39
hypothetically go in and find
the rule, that it is

105
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
written in there.
 

106
00:05:42 --> 00:05:47
One of the lines of evidence
for this is that at a certain

107
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
point during development as
they're learning this, they

108
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
start to overuse the rule.
 

109
00:05:53 --> 00:06:04
A child will say things like I
goed to the store yesterday, or

110
00:06:04 --> 00:06:09
I bringed the ball home from
school yesterday, or

111
00:06:09 --> 00:06:10
something like that.
 

112
00:06:10 --> 00:06:11
They'll start to
overgeneralize.

113
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
They don't do it all the time.
 

114
00:06:13 --> 00:06:17
But they start to behave as
though they are saying ah-ha,

115
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
got this verb here, I know I
need to make it into

116
00:06:19 --> 00:06:20
the past tense.
 

117
00:06:20 --> 00:06:23
What's the rule for
making the past tense?

118
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
I gotta stick an e-d
on the end of it.

119
00:06:26 --> 00:06:28
Even though a few months
earlier they might have

120
00:06:28 --> 00:06:31
successfully said went.
 

121
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
It is as if they learn
a rule, and they learn

122
00:06:34 --> 00:06:38
a set of exceptions.
 

123
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
When you go in and look
for what you're trying to

124
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
say, past tense of go.
 

125
00:06:43 --> 00:06:47
If the past tense of go, you
know, I went, doesn't get

126
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
there fast enough, you
default to the rule.

127
00:06:50 --> 00:06:54
You say I goed.
 

128
00:06:54 --> 00:07:02
This assumes a certain amount
of stuff in the head ahead of

129
00:07:02 --> 00:07:03
time, that's what this
cartoon is about.

130
00:07:03 --> 00:07:09
It doesn't need to be exactly
this kind of stuff, but this

131
00:07:09 --> 00:07:14
is the sort of stuff that
you might have in the head.

132
00:07:14 --> 00:07:16
Let's think, actually, going
back to the lectures I

133
00:07:16 --> 00:07:20
was giving on cognitive
development last week.

134
00:07:20 --> 00:07:23
Remember, there's pretty good
evidence that little kids

135
00:07:23 --> 00:07:26
have in their head an
idea about objects.

136
00:07:26 --> 00:07:28
They know there are such
things about objects.

137
00:07:28 --> 00:07:31
So -- oops, I didn't
put objects in here.

138
00:07:31 --> 00:07:36
Let's assume that there are
such things as objects.

139
00:07:36 --> 00:07:41
Also, we saw that little kids
know something about number,

140
00:07:41 --> 00:07:43
like they can do that Karen
Wynn style baby math.

141
00:07:43 --> 00:07:48
They know that there's 1 and
more than 1, certainly.

142
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
Now let's assume that they've
got some innate idea,

143
00:07:51 --> 00:07:54
some innate capability
to learn language.

144
00:07:54 --> 00:07:56
Well, if I'm going to learn a
language of any use, it's going

145
00:07:56 --> 00:07:59
to have to be able to talk
about these object things.

146
00:07:59 --> 00:08:03
So I'm going to have some
sort of innate idea that

147
00:08:03 --> 00:08:04
there will be nouns.
 

148
00:08:04 --> 00:08:07
I don't know what the nouns are
going to look like in this

149
00:08:07 --> 00:08:12
language, but I come into the
world in this view knowing

150
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
that there have to
be noun-like things.

151
00:08:15 --> 00:08:20
Not only that, I know that
there can be one thing and

152
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
there can be more
than one thing.

153
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
It therefore follows that
I need to be able to

154
00:08:25 --> 00:08:26
talk about that, too.
 

155
00:08:26 --> 00:08:32
And so my job as a little
language learner is to figure

156
00:08:32 --> 00:08:37
out what do the nouns look
like, and how do I make those

157
00:08:37 --> 00:08:43
into plural in my language.
 

158
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
I said there's an infinite
number of ways in

159
00:08:45 --> 00:08:47
principle that I could
designate a plural.

160
00:08:47 --> 00:08:52
But I will learn that, for the
most part, in English it's

161
00:08:52 --> 00:08:56
going to be add s, right?
 

162
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
Oh, look, there's the cat.
 

163
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01
Oh, look, there are
the cats and so on.

164
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
I'm going to have to do the
same thing as I was talking

165
00:09:03 --> 00:09:04
about in the past tense.
 

166
00:09:04 --> 00:09:07
I'm going to have to learn
there are exceptions.

167
00:09:07 --> 00:09:11
Yeah, cat, cats, rat,
rats, chair, chairs,

168
00:09:11 --> 00:09:14
mouse -- uh, mice.
 

169
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
Fish -- for some
reason fish is fish.

170
00:09:17 --> 00:09:20
One fish, two fish, red
fish, blue fish -- all

171
00:09:20 --> 00:09:22
that kind of stuff.
 

172
00:09:22 --> 00:09:26
So again, I'll learn a rule,
I'll overgeneralize that rule

173
00:09:26 --> 00:09:30
when I get to be three or four
years old, and I'll learn

174
00:09:30 --> 00:09:33
a set of exceptions.
 

175
00:09:33 --> 00:09:38
I will find when I become a
literature professor later on

176
00:09:38 --> 00:09:43
and study the history of
English literature, that things

177
00:09:43 --> 00:09:46
shift over time -- things that
were exceptions or things that

178
00:09:46 --> 00:09:49
were ungrammatical once upon a
time might become grammatical.

179
00:09:49 --> 00:09:52
It's a moving target language.
 

180
00:09:52 --> 00:09:55
You have to figure out
what the current state of

181
00:09:55 --> 00:09:59
your language might be.
 

182
00:09:59 --> 00:10:04
The alternative is the West
coast view, which is really

183
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
sort of a neural net parallel
distributed processing kind of

184
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
view is to say that we don't
have to propose that there's

185
00:10:10 --> 00:10:14
all this stuff, these
structures in the head

186
00:10:14 --> 00:10:15
in quite the same way.
 

187
00:10:15 --> 00:10:18
What we can say is look,
there's this very powerful

188
00:10:18 --> 00:10:23
association learner in here,
a device out there looking

189
00:10:23 --> 00:10:25
for statistical regularity.
 

190
00:10:25 --> 00:10:29
There's evidence -- I think I
mentioned last time that little

191
00:10:29 --> 00:10:34
kids long before they can speak
a language are already

192
00:10:34 --> 00:10:37
sensitive to the statistical
regularities of what syllables

193
00:10:37 --> 00:10:43
can follow what other syllables
in the noises that

194
00:10:43 --> 00:10:44
they are hearing.
 

195
00:10:44 --> 00:10:49
So you've got this very
powerful statistical learning

196
00:10:49 --> 00:10:50
devise in your head.
 

197
00:10:50 --> 00:10:55
It ends up behaving as if
it had a rule, but the

198
00:10:55 --> 00:11:01
rule is not written out
anywhere in brainware.

199
00:11:01 --> 00:11:04
It's just the way the
network behaves.

200
00:11:04 --> 00:11:10
In the same way that this hunk
of chalk -- where's somebody

201
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
who looks reasonably alert.
 

202
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
Do you look reasonably alert?
 

203
00:11:14 --> 00:11:15
No, now she's
looking elsewhere.

204
00:11:15 --> 00:11:18
 
 

205
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
All right, how about if
I just throw it out.

206
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
There we go, look at that.
 

207
00:11:22 --> 00:11:23
Very good.
 

208
00:11:23 --> 00:11:24
Send it back.
 

209
00:11:24 --> 00:11:25
That's a smart hunk of chalk.
 

210
00:11:25 --> 00:11:30
It knew to fly on a parabolic
path, right, knew a whole

211
00:11:30 --> 00:11:32
bunch of 801 style physics.
 

212
00:11:32 --> 00:11:34
It didn't know it in any
real sense, of course.

213
00:11:34 --> 00:11:40
It behaved as if, because it's
operating under simple physical

214
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
forces in the world and ends up
behaving as if it

215
00:11:43 --> 00:11:44
knows physics.
 

216
00:11:44 --> 00:11:48
It's a somewhat stretched
analogy, but the same sort

217
00:11:48 --> 00:11:50
of thing is going on here.
 

218
00:11:50 --> 00:11:54
You learn about the linguistic
world you are in and then you

219
00:11:54 --> 00:12:00
behave as if you knew these
rules, rather than having some

220
00:12:00 --> 00:12:06
sort of mechanism by which you
actually, in a sense, at birth

221
00:12:06 --> 00:12:09
knew that there should be such
rules and merely needed to

222
00:12:09 --> 00:12:13
figure out the particular form
that the rule took

223
00:12:13 --> 00:12:15
in your language.
 

224
00:12:15 --> 00:12:25
These are, in a sense, modern
and not hugely different views

225
00:12:25 --> 00:12:28
of initial positions that
are radically different.

226
00:12:28 --> 00:12:34
So, if this is a continuum
here, way over here somewhere

227
00:12:34 --> 00:12:40
would be radical nativist
views of language.

228
00:12:40 --> 00:12:44
Way over here somewhere
would be radical imperacist

229
00:12:44 --> 00:12:47
views of language.
 

230
00:12:47 --> 00:12:53
 
 

231
00:12:53 --> 00:12:57
The most radical nativist views
nobody particularly held,

232
00:12:57 --> 00:13:01
except I think I mentioned that
little children are subject to

233
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
this as an erroneous thought.
 

234
00:13:03 --> 00:13:10
That's the view that you are
not only born to have language,

235
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
but you're born to have
a specific language.

236
00:13:13 --> 00:13:20
So that if you are a Saudi kid,
that you are born to speak

237
00:13:20 --> 00:13:24
Arabic and that's all else
being equa -- well, even

238
00:13:24 --> 00:13:25
all else not being equal.
 

239
00:13:25 --> 00:13:26
You're a Saudi kid.
 

240
00:13:26 --> 00:13:30
You get transplanted to
Sweden, and at the right

241
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
moment Arabic appears.
 

242
00:13:33 --> 00:13:33
That's not true.
 

243
00:13:33 --> 00:13:37
Nobody other than a small kid
I think ever particularly

244
00:13:37 --> 00:13:39
believed this, because it
was clearly falsifiable.

245
00:13:39 --> 00:13:43
 
 

246
00:13:43 --> 00:13:46
The earliest experiment I know
in this area, and I don't know

247
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
if the experiment was ever
done, is something reported

248
00:13:49 --> 00:13:56
by Herodotus in his book
about traveling in Egypt.

249
00:13:56 --> 00:14:00
He says that King Psammetichos
of Egypt 2,500 years ago

250
00:14:00 --> 00:14:10
believed that there was an
original language of humankind

251
00:14:10 --> 00:14:16
where King Psammetichos had
grown up in the Judeo Christian

252
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
tradition, he might have
called it the language

253
00:14:18 --> 00:14:19
of the Garden of Eden.
 

254
00:14:19 --> 00:14:21
What language did Adam and
Eve speak in the garden?

255
00:14:21 --> 00:14:26
Well, the original
language of humankind.

256
00:14:26 --> 00:14:31
Psammetichos figured he would
go and figure out what

257
00:14:31 --> 00:14:32
that language was.
 

258
00:14:32 --> 00:14:34
He actually had a hypothesis
about what it was.

259
00:14:34 --> 00:14:35
He was King of Egypt.
 

260
00:14:35 --> 00:14:39
It stood to reason that
the original language of

261
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
humanity was Egyptian.
 

262
00:14:41 --> 00:14:44
So what he is alleged to have
done is to take two children,

263
00:14:44 --> 00:14:48
give them to a shepherd, tell
the shepherd to raise them with

264
00:14:48 --> 00:14:53
sheep and not talk to them, and
to report to the King what

265
00:14:53 --> 00:14:56
the first word was that
these children spoke.

266
00:14:56 --> 00:14:59
 
 

267
00:14:59 --> 00:15:02
The report is that when the
children first spoke, their

268
00:15:02 --> 00:15:07
first word was "beccau," which
sounds suspiciously like they

269
00:15:07 --> 00:15:09
were imitating the
sheep I think.

270
00:15:09 --> 00:15:14
But anyway, beccau turned out
to mean bread, and that seemed

271
00:15:14 --> 00:15:18
like a pretty encouraging
thing, except that it meant

272
00:15:18 --> 00:15:23
bread in Phrygian, the
language of Phrygia, which is

273
00:15:23 --> 00:15:25
in modern day Turkey.
 

274
00:15:25 --> 00:15:29
It wasn't word for bread
in Egyptian at all.

275
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
So, Psammetichos is reputed to
have been disappointed by the

276
00:15:32 --> 00:15:33
results of the experiment.
 

277
00:15:33 --> 00:15:36
Look, we don't know that the
experiment was ever done.

278
00:15:36 --> 00:15:40
We do know or we're pretty sure
we know how the experiment

279
00:15:40 --> 00:15:45
would have come out had
it actually been done.

280
00:15:45 --> 00:15:51
Which is that they wouldn't
have spoken a language at all.

281
00:15:51 --> 00:15:56
That in the absence of a
linguistic environment, even if

282
00:15:56 --> 00:15:59
you come into the world with
some native endowment to learn

283
00:15:59 --> 00:16:03
a language, which does seem to
be the case, you do not speak a

284
00:16:03 --> 00:16:08
normal human language unless
you are raised in a linguistic

285
00:16:08 --> 00:16:11
environment at some point.
 

286
00:16:11 --> 00:16:17
We think we know this from an
isolated set of cases over the

287
00:16:17 --> 00:16:23
course of historical record
where kids are somehow

288
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
deprived of linguistic input.
 

289
00:16:25 --> 00:16:31
Now that happens typically in
odd and disturbing kinds of

290
00:16:31 --> 00:16:36
circumstances, and so it's
nothing like a real experiment

291
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
because of course, you'd never
do the real experiment,

292
00:16:38 --> 00:16:39
it wouldn't be even
close to ethical.

293
00:16:39 --> 00:16:43
 
 

294
00:16:43 --> 00:16:46
This class of children are
known as wolf children,

295
00:16:46 --> 00:16:51
a term that has always
disturbed me personally.

296
00:16:51 --> 00:16:57
But the illusion is not to
wolfe with an e, but to the

297
00:16:57 --> 00:17:02
legendary story of the founding
of Rome where the twins Romulus

298
00:17:02 --> 00:17:06
and Remus are abandoned -- I
can't remember why -- but

299
00:17:06 --> 00:17:09
anyway they get suckled
by a she-wolf.

300
00:17:09 --> 00:17:12
So if you look at Roman coins
and things you'll see this

301
00:17:12 --> 00:17:16
picture of a great big wolf
and two little babies

302
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
suckling underneath.
 

303
00:17:19 --> 00:17:23
Presumably, the wolf wasn't
speaking good Latin, but

304
00:17:23 --> 00:17:26
presumably Romulus and Remus
managed to come up with good

305
00:17:26 --> 00:17:29
Latin somehow out of all this.
 

306
00:17:29 --> 00:17:33
 
 

307
00:17:33 --> 00:17:37
Occasionally it happens that
some kid gets abandons in the

308
00:17:37 --> 00:17:39
woods and somehow survives.
 

309
00:17:39 --> 00:17:42
I think there's the case of an
Indian child who's described

310
00:17:42 --> 00:17:43
in [? Gleitman ?].
 

311
00:17:43 --> 00:17:47
There was a very interesting
but disturbing book called

312
00:17:47 --> 00:17:51
Genie, written a few years ago,
about a child of deeply

313
00:17:51 --> 00:17:54
disturbed parents who had taken
her basically locked her in a

314
00:17:54 --> 00:17:58
closet for all of
her childhood.

315
00:17:58 --> 00:18:01
The bottom line is that this is
not going to be good for any

316
00:18:01 --> 00:18:04
aspect of your development, but
you don't develop a

317
00:18:04 --> 00:18:04
normal language.
 

318
00:18:04 --> 00:18:08
If you don't get exposed to
language during a so-called

319
00:18:08 --> 00:18:12
critical period, which for
language is certainly over by

320
00:18:12 --> 00:18:17
early adolescence and is
getting pretty much over, six,

321
00:18:17 --> 00:18:19
seven, eight years old you'd
better get your language

322
00:18:19 --> 00:18:24
experience in there
before that.

323
00:18:24 --> 00:18:26
You're just never going
to speak a normal

324
00:18:26 --> 00:18:27
grammatic language.
 

325
00:18:27 --> 00:18:29
The door closes on it.
 

326
00:18:29 --> 00:18:34
So, Genie, this poor girl who
was raised in a closet, could

327
00:18:34 --> 00:18:38
be taught a certain amount of
vocabulary and things like

328
00:18:38 --> 00:18:43
that, but could never somehow
get a real grip on the

329
00:18:43 --> 00:18:46
grammar of a language.
 

330
00:18:46 --> 00:18:48
It also turns out to be easier
to learn a second language

331
00:18:48 --> 00:18:52
during the critical period, but
not impossible to learn one

332
00:18:52 --> 00:18:55
afterwards, as those of you
have just started learning

333
00:18:55 --> 00:18:58
French or something
will be happy to know.

334
00:18:58 --> 00:19:04
The claim is that it's very
difficult to become a truly

335
00:19:04 --> 00:19:14
fluent speaker of a second
language later in life.

336
00:19:14 --> 00:19:17
But it's not impossible in the
way it appears to be impossible

337
00:19:17 --> 00:19:25
to learn a first language after
the end of the critical period.

338
00:19:25 --> 00:19:34
The alternative, the radical
alternative, to King

339
00:19:34 --> 00:19:36
Psammetichos on one side,
if we're sticking with

340
00:19:36 --> 00:19:38
classical references.
 

341
00:19:38 --> 00:19:41
On this side would be somebody
like Saint Augustine who writes

342
00:19:41 --> 00:19:43
that he knows how he
learned language.

343
00:19:43 --> 00:19:49
He learned language by
being explicitly taught.

344
00:19:49 --> 00:19:51
The same way you'd
learn anything else.

345
00:19:51 --> 00:20:00
That people said that's chalk,
that's a chair, that's your TA

346
00:20:00 --> 00:20:03
and you learned this
sort of stuff.

347
00:20:03 --> 00:20:06
That it was an act of
learning not unlike

348
00:20:06 --> 00:20:08
other acts of learning.
 

349
00:20:08 --> 00:20:12
This gets developed -- Saint
Augustine was not particularly

350
00:20:12 --> 00:20:15
working on learning theory.
 

351
00:20:15 --> 00:20:23
But by the time you get to the
mid-20th century and the heyday

352
00:20:23 --> 00:20:27
of behaviorism and all that
good Skinnarian pigeons in the

353
00:20:27 --> 00:20:33
box kind of thing, you get a
series of language learning

354
00:20:33 --> 00:20:37
that say well, look, language
learning is just a fancy

355
00:20:37 --> 00:20:40
variety of any other
kind of learning.

356
00:20:40 --> 00:20:45
You want your kid to speak
English and so you reward

357
00:20:45 --> 00:20:46
him for speaking English.
 

358
00:20:46 --> 00:20:50
You shape the behavior.
 

359
00:20:50 --> 00:20:52
The same time you're trying to
get the kid to do some sort of

360
00:20:52 --> 00:20:56
complicated thing like being
toilet trained, you're also

361
00:20:56 --> 00:21:02
trying to get him to do things
like saying I go to the store.

362
00:21:02 --> 00:21:04
Yesterday I went to the store.
 

363
00:21:04 --> 00:21:07
 
 

364
00:21:07 --> 00:21:10
It's just the same
thing more or less.

365
00:21:10 --> 00:21:12
 
 

366
00:21:12 --> 00:21:15
One of the great efforts to
make that into a single

367
00:21:15 --> 00:21:17
coherent story is B.F.
 

368
00:21:17 --> 00:21:23
Skinner's book called Verbal
Behavior -- good name

369
00:21:23 --> 00:21:25
from a good behaviorist.
 

370
00:21:25 --> 00:21:28
It's just another
kind of behavior.

371
00:21:28 --> 00:21:34
The start of the East coast
story and the start of modern

372
00:21:34 --> 00:21:38
cognitive science in some ways
is Noam Chomsky, then a young

373
00:21:38 --> 00:21:43
professor at MIT, writing a
scathing review of that book,

374
00:21:43 --> 00:21:45
which still bears reading.
 

375
00:21:45 --> 00:21:48
It's still fun to read that, or
you can go read the summary of

376
00:21:48 --> 00:21:52
it or the recap of it
in Pinker's book.

377
00:21:52 --> 00:21:55
But you have to imagine this
as sort of a cultural event.

378
00:21:55 --> 00:21:59
Skinner is the leading American
psychologist of the time, and

379
00:21:59 --> 00:22:07
this young Noam Chomsky guy is
going after him with a bat and

380
00:22:07 --> 00:22:09
both barrels blazing and any
other weaponry you

381
00:22:09 --> 00:22:10
can think of.
 

382
00:22:10 --> 00:22:13
It is not a temperate review.
 

383
00:22:13 --> 00:22:17
It is insulting in many ways.
 

384
00:22:17 --> 00:22:21
It's an insulting piece written
by a young guy about a very

385
00:22:21 --> 00:22:25
senior, established, important
guy, and it starts

386
00:22:25 --> 00:22:26
a revolution.
 

387
00:22:26 --> 00:22:28
Anyway, I'm not going to go
through the whole argument.

388
00:22:28 --> 00:22:37
But the sort of thing that
Chomsky points out is that --

389
00:22:37 --> 00:22:39
you know, Skinner's talking
about schedules of

390
00:22:39 --> 00:22:41
reinforcement.
 

391
00:22:41 --> 00:22:45
The patterns of reinforcement
for language just aren't there.

392
00:22:45 --> 00:22:48
This has been extensively
developed since Chomsky's time.

393
00:22:48 --> 00:22:53
But you can imagine this
as just an example.

394
00:22:53 --> 00:22:59
Imagine yourself back home as
the little kid and you go up to

395
00:22:59 --> 00:23:04
your mother and you say,
"Mommy, I loved you so much."

396
00:23:04 --> 00:23:09
What's the chance that she's
going to say, "Bad child, bad

397
00:23:09 --> 00:23:16
child, it's I love you." By the
same token, what's the chance

398
00:23:16 --> 00:23:23
that if you go up and say, as a
precocious three year old,

399
00:23:23 --> 00:23:28
"Mother dear, I'm sorry to have
to say this but it turns out

400
00:23:28 --> 00:23:32
that I actually loathe you and
despise the ground on which you

401
00:23:32 --> 00:23:37
walk." Your mother is not going
to say "That's a very

402
00:23:37 --> 00:23:39
sophisticated utterance
for a three year old.

403
00:23:39 --> 00:23:44
Good job." You're not going
to get -- look, that's

404
00:23:44 --> 00:23:45
a cartoon version.
 

405
00:23:45 --> 00:23:48
But when you go and look at
substantial bodies of child

406
00:23:48 --> 00:23:51
language and their interaction
with the grown-ups in their

407
00:23:51 --> 00:23:55
life, you don't find good
evidence for a systematic

408
00:23:55 --> 00:24:00
correction of language or a
systematic reinforcement

409
00:24:00 --> 00:24:01
for grammatical structure.
 

410
00:24:01 --> 00:24:06
You don't find any great
sensitivity on the part of

411
00:24:06 --> 00:24:08
the kid to that direction
when it's given.

412
00:24:08 --> 00:24:14
The sorts of things that every
parent -- they show up in the

413
00:24:14 --> 00:24:20
child language literature --
but any parent can tell you

414
00:24:20 --> 00:24:28
that the kid comes up you and
says, "Mommy, I loved you," and

415
00:24:28 --> 00:24:30
you say, "Oh, that's sweet,
honey but it's really Mommy I

416
00:24:30 --> 00:24:34
love you." The kids says,
"Yeah, that's right, Mommy, I

417
00:24:34 --> 00:24:39
loved you." They don't show an
awful lot of sensitivity to

418
00:24:39 --> 00:24:45
this sort of negative support
for what they're saying.

419
00:24:45 --> 00:24:47
How they actually figure out
eventually that it's wrong is

420
00:24:47 --> 00:24:49
an interesting and
important problem.

421
00:24:49 --> 00:24:54
But what is pretty clearly the
case is that a story that will

422
00:24:54 --> 00:24:59
explain how it is that I
persuaded my pigeon in my intro

423
00:24:59 --> 00:25:02
psych class to do ballet -- I
think I told that story here.

424
00:25:02 --> 00:25:04
But anyway, I shaped my
pigeon to do ballet.

425
00:25:04 --> 00:25:06
That was great.
 

426
00:25:06 --> 00:25:13
That such a story does not
cash out well as a story

427
00:25:13 --> 00:25:15
for how you're trying
to explain language.

428
00:25:15 --> 00:25:20
It does not seem to be
possible to explain

429
00:25:20 --> 00:25:25
language in those terms.
 

430
00:25:25 --> 00:25:28
As noted, if you want to know
more about this particular

431
00:25:28 --> 00:25:36
argument, I really would
recommend Pinker's book.

432
00:25:36 --> 00:25:38
It's good stuff.
 

433
00:25:38 --> 00:25:39
So, what do we got?
 

434
00:25:39 --> 00:25:43
We got the notion that specific
languages are learned.

435
00:25:43 --> 00:25:46
You didn't come into the
world pre-wired for English,

436
00:25:46 --> 00:25:48
Arabic, Chinese or whatever.
 

437
00:25:48 --> 00:25:52
Language in the abstract, it's
not exactly clear what it is

438
00:25:52 --> 00:25:56
that's innate, but something is
innate that allows you

439
00:25:56 --> 00:26:00
to learn language.
 

440
00:26:00 --> 00:26:05
That something could be as
specific as having, in a sense,

441
00:26:05 --> 00:26:09
the grammar written out in some
sort of abstract form in your

442
00:26:09 --> 00:26:11
head and you're filling
in the blanks.

443
00:26:11 --> 00:26:16
It could be something as
non-specific as having a device

444
00:26:16 --> 00:26:19
that's designed to look
for regularities in

445
00:26:19 --> 00:26:21
linguistic input.
 

446
00:26:21 --> 00:26:32
But something is in there that
pre-disposes you and any

447
00:26:32 --> 00:26:40
linguistically normal
human to learn language.

448
00:26:40 --> 00:26:44
In fact, it's not just
something that's pre-disposing

449
00:26:44 --> 00:26:47
you to learn a spoken language.
 

450
00:26:47 --> 00:26:53
One of the most interesting
bits of work in recent years in

451
00:26:53 --> 00:26:58
this area is the development of
what really boils down to a

452
00:26:58 --> 00:27:05
brand new language growing up,
as much as anything, out of

453
00:27:05 --> 00:27:07
whatever this innate
endowment is.

454
00:27:07 --> 00:27:12
This is the story of Nicaraguan
sign language before the

455
00:27:12 --> 00:27:16
Sandinista Revolution in
the '70s in Nicaragua.

456
00:27:16 --> 00:27:23
I gather that deaf kids were
typically raised at home and

457
00:27:23 --> 00:27:29
treated as though they were not
just deaf, but not bright.

458
00:27:29 --> 00:27:31
They weren't going
to learn much.

459
00:27:31 --> 00:27:33
 
 

460
00:27:33 --> 00:27:34
I don't know if this
 

461
00:27:34 --> 00:27:36
is universally true, but there
was a population of such kids.

462
00:27:36 --> 00:27:40
When the Revolution happened,
one of the things that happened

463
00:27:40 --> 00:27:42
was a school for the deaf was
set up in Managua, in the

464
00:27:42 --> 00:27:46
capital, and a bunch of deaf
kids were brought together

465
00:27:46 --> 00:27:49
for the first time.
 

466
00:27:49 --> 00:27:55
What happened was that -- deaf
kids, even in the absence of

467
00:27:55 --> 00:28:00
other members of the deaf
community, will produce signs,

468
00:28:00 --> 00:28:07
gestures called home signs
that indicate certain things.

469
00:28:07 --> 00:28:10
It's sort of a basic
vocabulary, not a language, but

470
00:28:10 --> 00:28:13
sort of a core vocabulary that
you can use to communicate with

471
00:28:13 --> 00:28:17
your hearing parents,
for instance.

472
00:28:17 --> 00:28:22
What happened was that all
these deaf kids got together

473
00:28:22 --> 00:28:27
and I don't know what was going
on in school, but I think what

474
00:28:27 --> 00:28:31
was going on at night up in the
dormitory was they were working

475
00:28:31 --> 00:28:35
something out so they could
communicate with each other.

476
00:28:35 --> 00:28:41
They put together sort
of a proto language.

477
00:28:41 --> 00:28:45
Then the next generation, the
next cohort of kids come,

478
00:28:45 --> 00:28:49
and now there's a crude
linguistic environment.

479
00:28:49 --> 00:28:53
What has happened over the next
few cohorts of kids is that the

480
00:28:53 --> 00:28:57
next round of language learning
kids have systematically

481
00:28:57 --> 00:29:02
developed a language that now
has grammatical structures in

482
00:29:02 --> 00:29:04
it that look like the
grammatical structures

483
00:29:04 --> 00:29:06
of other languages.
 

484
00:29:06 --> 00:29:09
American Sign Language, which
is the common language used in

485
00:29:09 --> 00:29:12
the deaf community, the signing
deaf community here, is a

486
00:29:12 --> 00:29:16
language like French, English,
Chinese or whatever.

487
00:29:16 --> 00:29:20
It's not English translated
into hand gesture.

488
00:29:20 --> 00:29:23
Nicaraguan Sign Language is not
American Sign Language, it's a

489
00:29:23 --> 00:29:28
new sign language with its own
set of vocabulary and its

490
00:29:28 --> 00:29:30
own grammatical structure.
 

491
00:29:30 --> 00:29:37
But that grammatical structure
seems to reflect an underlying

492
00:29:37 --> 00:29:41
tendency for all languages
to have certain

493
00:29:41 --> 00:29:42
structures to them.
 

494
00:29:42 --> 00:29:45
Let me give you one example
because it's brand new -- this

495
00:29:45 --> 00:29:47
year's discovery in this realm.
 

496
00:29:47 --> 00:29:52
Suppose you're telling the
Jack and Jill story, right.

497
00:29:52 --> 00:29:55
Jack and Jill went up the hill
and then stuff happens and they

498
00:29:55 --> 00:29:58
fall down the hill, right.
 

499
00:29:58 --> 00:30:04
In English, the fall down part
and the hill part are separate.

500
00:30:04 --> 00:30:06
They are obligatorily separate.
 

501
00:30:06 --> 00:30:08
There's the verb part
and there's the

502
00:30:08 --> 00:30:10
object of that verb.
 

503
00:30:10 --> 00:30:12
You fall down and you
fell down the hill.

504
00:30:12 --> 00:30:15
There's no reason that would
need to be the case in

505
00:30:15 --> 00:30:17
a sign language, right.
 

506
00:30:17 --> 00:30:20
You could perfectly have a
gesture that was blah that

507
00:30:20 --> 00:30:23
designates the act of
falling down a hill.

508
00:30:23 --> 00:30:29
And indeed, apparently, the
first generations of signers

509
00:30:29 --> 00:30:33
in this Nicaraguan school,
have signs like that.

510
00:30:33 --> 00:30:36
But the new kids, the kids who
came in young and are learning,

511
00:30:36 --> 00:30:41
developing this new grammatical
version of sign language, have

512
00:30:41 --> 00:30:44
now separated those sings
out and have a falling

513
00:30:44 --> 00:30:46
sign and a hill sign.
 

514
00:30:46 --> 00:30:48
I don't know that the signs
look like that at all.

515
00:30:48 --> 00:30:51
The important piece of it
though -- that's another

516
00:30:51 --> 00:30:54
misconception about signs is
that the signs necessarily need

517
00:30:54 --> 00:30:56
to be sort of pictographic.
 

518
00:30:56 --> 00:30:59
There's no requirement that the
hill sign look like a hill.

519
00:30:59 --> 00:31:02
But those of us who are
complete illiterates in

520
00:31:02 --> 00:31:04
anything like a sign language
it might as well be because

521
00:31:04 --> 00:31:05
it gives you the idea.
 

522
00:31:05 --> 00:31:10
So, they have developed instead
of falling down the hill sign,

523
00:31:10 --> 00:31:16
a thing falling hill grammar
that corresponds to the same

524
00:31:16 --> 00:31:20
sort of constraints that
show up in other languages.

525
00:31:20 --> 00:31:22
 
 

526
00:31:22 --> 00:31:27
This whole project has been
interesting evidence for the

527
00:31:27 --> 00:31:34
powerful in which the human
brain is there to learn, and

528
00:31:34 --> 00:31:38
even if necessary to
create language.

529
00:31:38 --> 00:31:43
Well, that raises the
interesting question of well,

530
00:31:43 --> 00:31:46
what about non-human brains.
 

531
00:31:46 --> 00:31:50
Do animals have language?
 

532
00:31:50 --> 00:31:55
This has been a question
for a long, long time.

533
00:31:55 --> 00:32:03
It's been a scientific question
for a reasonably long time.

534
00:32:03 --> 00:32:05
We're going to talk about it's
important to distinguish

535
00:32:05 --> 00:32:10
between two different
sorts of language.

536
00:32:10 --> 00:32:16
One would be any natural
language that the animal might

537
00:32:16 --> 00:32:21
have on their own -- do animals
talk to each other in the

538
00:32:21 --> 00:32:25
absence of humans intervening.
 

539
00:32:25 --> 00:32:28
The other question is can we
teach them our language, can

540
00:32:28 --> 00:32:36
we teach them how to talk
like us in some fashion.

541
00:32:36 --> 00:32:41
Within this natural and trained
language dichotomy, then it's

542
00:32:41 --> 00:32:45
important to break the question
of language down into smaller

543
00:32:45 --> 00:32:50
pieces because otherwise you
end up in an endless sterile

544
00:32:50 --> 00:32:51
argument about well,
what exactly do you

545
00:32:51 --> 00:32:54
mean by language.
 

546
00:32:54 --> 00:32:58
If I write a question
on the final exam,

547
00:32:58 --> 00:33:00
because it won't be on the
mid-term because today's topic

548
00:33:00 --> 00:33:02
is not on the mid-term.
 

549
00:33:02 --> 00:33:05
If I write a question on the
final exam that basically says

550
00:33:05 --> 00:33:10
do animals have language, it
would be perfectly possible to

551
00:33:10 --> 00:33:15
write a coherent answer for
either the yes or no position.

552
00:33:15 --> 00:33:18
But that would depend
on what it is that

553
00:33:18 --> 00:33:19
you mean by language.
 

554
00:33:19 --> 00:33:21
So let's break this
down a little bit.

555
00:33:21 --> 00:33:26
For starters, do animals
have something that we

556
00:33:26 --> 00:33:28
could call signals.
 

557
00:33:28 --> 00:33:33
Do they have sensory stimuli
that are communicative

558
00:33:33 --> 00:33:35
in their intent?
 

559
00:33:35 --> 00:33:40
Well, the answer to
that is clearly yes.

560
00:33:40 --> 00:33:46
There's no problem with
figuring that out at all.

561
00:33:46 --> 00:33:52
A peacock's tail is a
signal to the peahen.

562
00:33:52 --> 00:33:57
Tropical fish -- do tropical
fish have all these beautiful

563
00:33:57 --> 00:33:58
colors all over them?
 

564
00:33:58 --> 00:34:03
Well, the idea is that I'm a
tropical fish with, oh, my

565
00:34:03 --> 00:34:08
goodness with stripes on, and I
gotta look for another tropical

566
00:34:08 --> 00:34:13
fish with stripes on, because
if I mate with one with spots

567
00:34:13 --> 00:34:15
on, nothing's going to happen.
 

568
00:34:15 --> 00:34:18
But if I mate with one with
stripes on, we get more

569
00:34:18 --> 00:34:21
little stripey fish.
 

570
00:34:21 --> 00:34:24
The peacock tail story is
supposed to be slightly

571
00:34:24 --> 00:34:25
more complicated.
 

572
00:34:25 --> 00:34:29
The standard evolutionary story
for peacock tails is that

573
00:34:29 --> 00:34:33
peacock tails are
really stupid.

574
00:34:33 --> 00:34:37
They don't help you fly, they
make you more likely to

575
00:34:37 --> 00:34:39
get chomped on by a
predator and stuff.

576
00:34:39 --> 00:34:43
But a huge investment.
 

577
00:34:43 --> 00:34:47
What this id is the male
peacock saying I am so fit, my

578
00:34:47 --> 00:34:52
genes are so good that I grew
this whole thing just

579
00:34:52 --> 00:34:55
for you, honey.
 

580
00:34:55 --> 00:34:58
You really ought to come
and check this out.

581
00:34:58 --> 00:35:01
So it's a signal.
 

582
00:35:01 --> 00:35:04
It's not just an awful lot of
animal signals seem to be

583
00:35:04 --> 00:35:08
about sex and mating issues.
 

584
00:35:08 --> 00:35:09
Not all of them.
 

585
00:35:09 --> 00:35:13
So, Vervet monkeys, for
instance, have three

586
00:35:13 --> 00:35:17
distinct alarm calls.
 

587
00:35:17 --> 00:35:19
How do you know they're
distinct alarm calls?

588
00:35:19 --> 00:35:23
Well, you go off and record
them, and then you get your --

589
00:35:23 --> 00:35:25
not your iPod because they
don't have the little ear --

590
00:35:25 --> 00:35:28
you get your boom box or
something and you play them to

591
00:35:28 --> 00:35:29
a bunch of Vervet monkeys.
 

592
00:35:29 --> 00:35:34
If you play call number one,
all the Vervet monkeys

593
00:35:34 --> 00:35:36
jump up a tree.
 

594
00:35:36 --> 00:35:39
If you play call number two,
all the Vervet monkeys

595
00:35:39 --> 00:35:40
jumps down a hole.
 

596
00:35:40 --> 00:35:42
If you play number three,
they all stand up

597
00:35:42 --> 00:35:43
and look all around.
 

598
00:35:43 --> 00:35:50
Apparently, what this is about
is if you're a Vervet monkey

599
00:35:50 --> 00:35:55
and you see a leopard, you
give one scream and everybody

600
00:35:55 --> 00:35:58
jumps up the tree because the
leopard can't go up the tree.

601
00:35:58 --> 00:36:02
If you see a hawk or whatever
the big predator bird is who

602
00:36:02 --> 00:36:05
eats Vervet monkeys, you give a
different screen, you should

603
00:36:05 --> 00:36:08
jump down the hole because the
bird ain't going down the hole,

604
00:36:08 --> 00:36:12
and makes you want to just
keep an eye out for them.

605
00:36:12 --> 00:36:14
So if somebody thinks they see
a snake, everybody else's is

606
00:36:14 --> 00:36:17
just going to look around.
 

607
00:36:17 --> 00:36:19
There's sort of a three
word vocabulary there.

608
00:36:19 --> 00:36:21
It also gets onto the second
issue on the handout.

609
00:36:21 --> 00:36:24
 
 

610
00:36:24 --> 00:36:26
Yes, it should say meaning.
 

611
00:36:26 --> 00:36:27
Do these signals have meaning?
 

612
00:36:27 --> 00:36:27
Well, sure.
 

613
00:36:27 --> 00:36:31
There's no point to having
a signal of this sort if

614
00:36:31 --> 00:36:33
it doesn't have meaning.
 

615
00:36:33 --> 00:36:35
Well, you could have a
signal without meaning.

616
00:36:35 --> 00:36:39
Look, I got a rock here.
 

617
00:36:39 --> 00:36:47
This crystal could be thought
of as signaling its safireness

618
00:36:47 --> 00:36:48
or something like that.
 

619
00:36:48 --> 00:36:51
But no other safire
gives a hoot about it.

620
00:36:51 --> 00:36:53
There's no meaning there
from the point of view

621
00:36:53 --> 00:36:55
of the rock, it just is.
 

622
00:36:55 --> 00:36:59
Whereas, an animal's signals
of the sort that we've been

623
00:36:59 --> 00:37:02
talking about clearly have
communicative intent.

624
00:37:02 --> 00:37:04
There is a purpose here.
 

625
00:37:04 --> 00:37:08
It's not even confined just
to animals it turns out.

626
00:37:08 --> 00:37:15
There are trees who respond
to predator attacks by

627
00:37:15 --> 00:37:18
releasing a chemical.
 

628
00:37:18 --> 00:37:21
It's all quite a
passive kind of thing.

629
00:37:21 --> 00:37:26
The bug chews on the leaves,
that ruptures the cells which

630
00:37:26 --> 00:37:30
causes the chemical to be
released, which can then be

631
00:37:30 --> 00:37:32
picked up by the
next tree over.

632
00:37:32 --> 00:37:36
The next tree over in reponse
now mobilizes a defense

633
00:37:36 --> 00:37:38
against that predator.
 

634
00:37:38 --> 00:37:42
So, in a sense, the trees
are talking to each other.

635
00:37:42 --> 00:37:47
There's a signal there
and it's being received.

636
00:37:47 --> 00:37:52
So, no doubt that the animal
kingdom has signals.

637
00:37:52 --> 00:37:57
The equivalent in human
language would be phoneme.

638
00:37:57 --> 00:38:02
No doubt that these signals
have meaning, at least in some

639
00:38:02 --> 00:38:05
cases, and that could be
considered to be sort of the

640
00:38:05 --> 00:38:07
equivalent of morpheme.
 

641
00:38:07 --> 00:38:09
 
 

642
00:38:09 --> 00:38:10
What about human language?
 

643
00:38:10 --> 00:38:14
What about training an animal
to use human language?

644
00:38:14 --> 00:38:21
Could be the case that the only
reason that a chimp, who is a

645
00:38:21 --> 00:38:26
close relation of ours, hasn't
talked to us is because

646
00:38:26 --> 00:38:28
nobody talked to him.
 

647
00:38:28 --> 00:38:32
So back in the '30s, the
Hayes's, a couple in Salt

648
00:38:32 --> 00:38:34
Lake City as I recall,
tried this out.

649
00:38:34 --> 00:38:39
What they did was they had
a kid, [? Maracatridas. ?]

650
00:38:39 --> 00:38:41
They had a kid,
they got a chimp.

651
00:38:41 --> 00:38:44
They said we'll raise the
two of them identically.

652
00:38:44 --> 00:38:46
I don't know, the chimp might
sleep through the night sooner.

653
00:38:46 --> 00:38:49
 
 

654
00:38:49 --> 00:38:52
They'll talk to the kid,
they'll talk to the chimp.

655
00:38:52 --> 00:38:56
After how long?
 

656
00:38:56 --> 00:38:58
It doesn't say how
long they were at it.

657
00:38:58 --> 00:39:01
You don't want to do this for
too long because after awhile,

658
00:39:01 --> 00:39:06
raising your chimp just hanging
around in the play room with

659
00:39:06 --> 00:39:11
your a kid, is not going to be
good for the kid, because the

660
00:39:11 --> 00:39:16
chimp may not talk a lot, but
the chimp grows big and strong

661
00:39:16 --> 00:39:20
and will play with your kid in
ways that your kid

662
00:39:20 --> 00:39:22
will not enjoy.
 

663
00:39:22 --> 00:39:26
But the chimp didn't talk.
 

664
00:39:26 --> 00:39:31
This is important, because any
neurologically normal child

665
00:39:31 --> 00:39:35
raised in a linguistic
environment will talk, will

666
00:39:35 --> 00:39:42
learn to talk, or if deaf will
communicate, you and given

667
00:39:42 --> 00:39:46
appropriate input will
communicate in other ways.

668
00:39:46 --> 00:39:54
The chimp is reputed to have
said, I think mamma, papa

669
00:39:54 --> 00:39:58
and cup, and that was it.
 

670
00:39:58 --> 00:40:03
Now, one of the problems here
that was quickly identified is

671
00:40:03 --> 00:40:07
that the chimp's vocal
apparatus is not like yours and

672
00:40:07 --> 00:40:13
mine and is poorly designed to
make the range of human phoneme

673
00:40:13 --> 00:40:17
that are important
in human language.

674
00:40:17 --> 00:40:25
So, it occured to subsequent
researchers to try using sign

675
00:40:25 --> 00:40:31
language with chimps because
chimps are very good with their

676
00:40:31 --> 00:40:34
hands -- there's no problem
making the sort of gestures,

677
00:40:34 --> 00:40:37
there's no physical limitation
on the soft to gestures

678
00:40:37 --> 00:40:41
that the chimps could
make or gorillas.

679
00:40:41 --> 00:40:46
Limited work with orangutans
who turn out to be big

680
00:40:46 --> 00:40:48
and lazy, I understand.
 

681
00:40:48 --> 00:40:55
But chimps, Bonobo chimps and
gorillas all make good signers.

682
00:40:55 --> 00:40:59
 
 

683
00:40:59 --> 00:41:03
So most of the effort to teach
human language to primates has

684
00:41:03 --> 00:41:09
involved sign language or
computer keyboard arrangements

685
00:41:09 --> 00:41:13
where you're sort of teaching
the animal to type, in a

686
00:41:13 --> 00:41:19
sense, rather than to sign.
 

687
00:41:19 --> 00:41:25
Now it's true that chimps don't
have the vocal apparatus to

688
00:41:25 --> 00:41:27
talk the way you and I talk.
 

689
00:41:27 --> 00:41:32
But that couldn't be the whole
story, because if you have a

690
00:41:32 --> 00:41:35
child born with something
congenital malformation that

691
00:41:35 --> 00:41:39
makes it impossible for them to
talk properly, that child

692
00:41:39 --> 00:41:44
will talk badly but will talk
and will learn a language.

693
00:41:44 --> 00:41:49
A chimp in the same situation
will simply not talk.

694
00:41:49 --> 00:41:53
There is a fundamental
difference in the way that the

695
00:41:53 --> 00:41:58
chimp and the child are
responding to linguistic input.

696
00:41:58 --> 00:42:02
 
 

697
00:42:02 --> 00:42:06
So, can you teach it to sign?
 

698
00:42:06 --> 00:42:06
Yes.
 

699
00:42:06 --> 00:42:08
Actually, you can
teach them to sign.

700
00:42:08 --> 00:42:13
They've got a whole string of
chimps who do really quite well

701
00:42:13 --> 00:42:22
with vocabulary on the order of
hundreds up signs that seem

702
00:42:22 --> 00:42:25
to have discreet meaning.
 

703
00:42:25 --> 00:42:28
It's not limited
even to chimps.

704
00:42:28 --> 00:42:33
Irene Pepperberg who was here
for a while, is now a Fellow at

705
00:42:33 --> 00:42:38
Harvard this year, has made a
career out of studying

706
00:42:38 --> 00:42:40
African Grey parrots.
 

707
00:42:40 --> 00:42:44
It's a not terribly dramatic,
nice looking little parrot with

708
00:42:44 --> 00:42:47
a nice little bird brain.
 

709
00:42:47 --> 00:42:50
The nice thing, of course,
about parrots is that they can

710
00:42:50 --> 00:42:55
form the sounds -- they're
pretty good with the phoneme,

711
00:42:55 --> 00:42:57
Polly want a cracker and
all that sort of stuff.

712
00:42:57 --> 00:42:59
But they're also
remarkably bright.

713
00:42:59 --> 00:43:02
 
 

714
00:43:02 --> 00:43:08
Alex, her great African Grey
has a vocabulary on the order

715
00:43:08 --> 00:43:17
of 50 to 100 words, I think,
that he can use in various

716
00:43:17 --> 00:43:20
and reasonable ways.
 

717
00:43:20 --> 00:43:27
So if Irene says to Alex, pick
up the blue thing or the blue

718
00:43:27 --> 00:43:32
one, Alex will toddle over
and grab a blue thing.

719
00:43:32 --> 00:43:34
If you say get the truck,
it'll go get the truck

720
00:43:34 --> 00:43:35
and stuff like that.
 

721
00:43:35 --> 00:43:41
It clearly has the grasp of
vocabulary and ability to use

722
00:43:41 --> 00:43:47
it in some fashion or other.
 

723
00:43:47 --> 00:43:48
Mostly trained.
 

724
00:43:48 --> 00:43:49
Almost all
 

725
00:43:49 --> 00:43:54
of the examples of animal use
of a human language, any

726
00:43:54 --> 00:43:57
aspect of a human language,
are heavily trained.

727
00:43:57 --> 00:44:00
Again, that's different from a
little kid where a little kid

728
00:44:00 --> 00:44:05
will pick up a language just
by being around speakers.

729
00:44:05 --> 00:44:12
There are a couple of instances
now in the literature where

730
00:44:12 --> 00:44:16
children, the offspring of
signing apes have picked

731
00:44:16 --> 00:44:18
up signing on their own.
 

732
00:44:18 --> 00:44:20
So it may, in fact, be
the case that you don't

733
00:44:20 --> 00:44:23
need explicit training.
 

734
00:44:23 --> 00:44:32
But what does seem to be the
case is that chimps and parrots

735
00:44:32 --> 00:44:39
can use what you'd probably
consider to be morpheme --

736
00:44:39 --> 00:44:42
signs with meaning
of some sort.

737
00:44:42 --> 00:44:45
There are issues about
the data quality.

738
00:44:45 --> 00:44:52
So if you point to something,
if you point to this banana and

739
00:44:52 --> 00:44:57
ask one of signing apes what it
is, you'll probably get banana

740
00:44:57 --> 00:45:01
but you might get something out
like banana, banana, me tickle,

741
00:45:01 --> 00:45:04
banana, you tickle me,
banana, banana or something.

742
00:45:04 --> 00:45:09
You might wonder whether or not
you should code that as banana.

743
00:45:09 --> 00:45:12
 
 

744
00:45:12 --> 00:45:16
I saw one description that said
that chimps tend to run on at

745
00:45:16 --> 00:45:20
the hands -- you know, the
expression that somebody

746
00:45:20 --> 00:45:21
runs on at the mouth.
 

747
00:45:21 --> 00:45:26
Well, chimps sign a lot, these
signing chimps, perhaps because

748
00:45:26 --> 00:45:28
they're playing the same
guessing game that we're

749
00:45:28 --> 00:45:30
all playing with language.
 

750
00:45:30 --> 00:45:32
What does this guy
want from me?

751
00:45:32 --> 00:45:35
What's he trying to -- pointing
at that thing, oh yes.

752
00:45:35 --> 00:45:40
If I make these banana signs,
maybe a few other signs in

753
00:45:40 --> 00:45:43
there, good things will happen,
he'll be happy with me and

754
00:45:43 --> 00:45:45
maybe we'll get good stuff.
 

755
00:45:45 --> 00:45:51
So, in any case, we've got
evidence for signals,

756
00:45:51 --> 00:45:53
we've got evidence that
they have meaning.

757
00:45:53 --> 00:45:55
How about grammar?
 

758
00:45:55 --> 00:46:00
Is there any evidence
for grammar in animals?

759
00:46:00 --> 00:46:02
Things get thinner there.
 

760
00:46:02 --> 00:46:09
Recall that you can use
grammatical information to get

761
00:46:09 --> 00:46:11
yourself into the meaning of
an utterance, even if

762
00:46:11 --> 00:46:13
you don't really--.
 

763
00:46:13 --> 00:46:14
Did I put it on the handout?
 

764
00:46:14 --> 00:46:17
"Colorless green ideas sleep
furiously," which I think is a

765
00:46:17 --> 00:46:23
Chomsky-ism originally designed
to point out that purely

766
00:46:23 --> 00:46:30
syntactic information tells you
something, even without much in

767
00:46:30 --> 00:46:33
the way of, you know how
that sentence put together.

768
00:46:33 --> 00:46:35
Actually, this goes
back before that.

769
00:46:35 --> 00:46:38
How many of you are great
Alice In Wonderland fans from

770
00:46:38 --> 00:46:41
your youth at some point?
 

771
00:46:41 --> 00:46:43
Oh, very limited.
 

772
00:46:43 --> 00:46:46
So, most people cannot sit here
and quote back to me "'Twas

773
00:46:46 --> 00:46:50
Brillig and the slithy toves,
did gyre and gimble in the

774
00:46:50 --> 00:46:53
wabe, all mimsy were the
borogoves and the mome raths

775
00:46:53 --> 00:46:57
outgrabe." You have no
idea what that's about.

776
00:46:57 --> 00:46:59
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
 

777
00:46:59 --> 00:47:02
PROFESSOR: It's the
Jabberwocky poem in

778
00:47:02 --> 00:47:04
Through The Looking Glass?
 

779
00:47:04 --> 00:47:07
I think it's the Looking Glass.
 

780
00:47:07 --> 00:47:10
Anyway, it's in one of
the two Alice books.

781
00:47:10 --> 00:47:14
But the interesting thing about
it is even though you have no

782
00:47:14 --> 00:47:19
idea "'Twas Billig and the
slithy toves, did gyre and

783
00:47:19 --> 00:47:21
gimble in the wabe." You, what?
 

784
00:47:21 --> 00:47:24
Well, but you know that
now that there are some

785
00:47:24 --> 00:47:26
things cold toves.
 

786
00:47:26 --> 00:47:30
They have the attribute
of slithiness.

787
00:47:30 --> 00:47:36
They can do things that are
apparently gyring and gimbling.

788
00:47:36 --> 00:47:40
You can say things like gyring
and gimbling -- i-n-g'ing these

789
00:47:40 --> 00:47:44
things, even though I got no
idea what this verb means,

790
00:47:44 --> 00:47:45
you just know it's a verb.
 

791
00:47:45 --> 00:47:48
So that's the sort of power
of the grammar of the

792
00:47:48 --> 00:47:50
syntax of the language.
 

793
00:47:50 --> 00:47:55
To what extent do animals
have a grip on that?

794
00:47:55 --> 00:47:59
The answer seems to be
a pretty limited grip.

795
00:47:59 --> 00:48:08
There is evidence for word
order sensitivity in animal

796
00:48:08 --> 00:48:10
signing, for instance.
 

797
00:48:10 --> 00:48:20
So you can have the chimp
equivalent of John hit

798
00:48:20 --> 00:48:25
Mary being different
from Mary hit John.

799
00:48:25 --> 00:48:30
Those are the same
word, different order,

800
00:48:30 --> 00:48:32
different meaning.
 

801
00:48:32 --> 00:48:34
Chimps will show a
sensitivity to that.

802
00:48:34 --> 00:48:40
In fact, when this was a hot
issue and people were arguing

803
00:48:40 --> 00:48:45
about it vociferously, Epstein
up at Harvard who was one of

804
00:48:45 --> 00:48:47
Skinner's last students, used
to have a great time trying to

805
00:48:47 --> 00:48:52
do these fancy chimp language
demonstrations with pigeons.

806
00:48:52 --> 00:48:55
He showed that sure enough, you
could get a pigeon to

807
00:48:55 --> 00:49:00
understand that you got a bunch
of colored keys in your Skinner

808
00:49:00 --> 00:49:07
box, that if I pick red, green,
blue I get food, but if I do

809
00:49:07 --> 00:49:11
blue, green, red I get water,
and the pigeon would respond

810
00:49:11 --> 00:49:12
appropriately to that.
 

811
00:49:12 --> 00:49:18
So order information is there
in chimp signing and it's in

812
00:49:18 --> 00:49:20
there in other behaviors too.
 

813
00:49:20 --> 00:49:24
There's order information,
structural information in

814
00:49:24 --> 00:49:27
natural animal language, too.
 

815
00:49:27 --> 00:49:33
It's not just ah means snake
or something like that.

816
00:49:33 --> 00:49:36
So, for example, bees.
 

817
00:49:36 --> 00:49:45
How many of you have seen
the waggle dance of bees?

818
00:49:45 --> 00:49:47
It's pretty thin stuff here.
 

819
00:49:47 --> 00:49:50
You get in free to the science
museum here, I believe,

820
00:49:50 --> 00:49:52
as MIT students.
 

821
00:49:52 --> 00:49:57
Sometime, like Friday when
you're done with the mid-term

822
00:49:57 --> 00:49:59
or something, you want to go
over to the science museum, you

823
00:49:59 --> 00:50:02
go up to the third floor,
fourth floor where

824
00:50:02 --> 00:50:02
the library is.
 

825
00:50:02 --> 00:50:04
They got a beehive there.
 

826
00:50:04 --> 00:50:07
If you look at this beehive --
it's a big glass plane so you

827
00:50:07 --> 00:50:10
can look in on it -- what you
will see, not so much at the

828
00:50:10 --> 00:50:12
time of year because they're
all going to bed at this point.

829
00:50:12 --> 00:50:19
But anyway, what you'll see is
a bee who will be marching up

830
00:50:19 --> 00:50:28
the hive with a characteristic
waggle of her backside, and

831
00:50:28 --> 00:50:35
then looping back down and
repeating this while a whole

832
00:50:35 --> 00:50:37
bunch of other bees are
gathered around -- it's easy to

833
00:50:37 --> 00:50:42
find because typically there's
sort of a circle of

834
00:50:42 --> 00:50:45
bees watching this.
 

835
00:50:45 --> 00:50:50
This is a highly structured bit
of communication about where

836
00:50:50 --> 00:50:53
to go to look for food.
 

837
00:50:53 --> 00:50:58
I didn't go off and review my
waggle dance information, but

838
00:50:58 --> 00:51:03
I'm pretty sure that memory
serves correctly to say that

839
00:51:03 --> 00:51:07
the length of the vector here
gives information about

840
00:51:07 --> 00:51:10
how far you've got to go.
 

841
00:51:10 --> 00:51:13
That the direction of the
vector is giving you

842
00:51:13 --> 00:51:18
orientation relative to the sun
about which direction to fly.

843
00:51:18 --> 00:51:24
I think amplitude of the waggle
is telling you about the

844
00:51:24 --> 00:51:28
magnitude of the food source
-- how good is this stuff.

845
00:51:28 --> 00:51:31
 
 

846
00:51:31 --> 00:51:32
Got any waggle dance experts?
 

847
00:51:32 --> 00:51:35
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].
 

848
00:51:35 --> 00:51:36
PROFESSOR: An altitude
 

849
00:51:36 --> 00:51:37
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].
 

850
00:51:37 --> 00:51:41
 
 

851
00:51:41 --> 00:51:43
PROFESSOR: Signaling how
high you should fly?

852
00:51:43 --> 00:51:46
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].
 

853
00:51:46 --> 00:51:46
PROFESSOR: That's cool.
 

854
00:51:46 --> 00:51:48
I didn't know that.
 

855
00:51:48 --> 00:51:50
Why would they care?
 

856
00:51:50 --> 00:51:52
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].
 

857
00:51:52 --> 00:51:55
PROFESSOR: Oh, of course.
 

858
00:51:55 --> 00:51:58
Not all the flowers are
just lying on the ground.

859
00:51:58 --> 00:52:01
Particularly in Boston, it
could be a roof garden.

860
00:52:01 --> 00:52:02
In any case, that's cool.
 

861
00:52:02 --> 00:52:04
But you don't remember
what the signal is?

862
00:52:04 --> 00:52:04
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
 

863
00:52:04 --> 00:52:08
AUDIENCE: The looping back
piece contains information

864
00:52:08 --> 00:52:10
too, but I don't
remember what that is.

865
00:52:10 --> 00:52:13
Very clever research that
people do one this.

866
00:52:13 --> 00:52:17
It's a lovely body
of literature.

867
00:52:17 --> 00:52:24
But in any case, very
structured and full of a

868
00:52:24 --> 00:52:29
sort of native grammar.
 

869
00:52:29 --> 00:52:34
But it's pretty limited stuff.
 

870
00:52:34 --> 00:52:38
 
 

871
00:52:38 --> 00:52:43
The newest evidence for what
the limitation might be that

872
00:52:43 --> 00:52:48
makes animal grammar
fundamentally different from

873
00:52:48 --> 00:52:53
your grammar and my grammar
comes from an experiment

874
00:52:53 --> 00:52:54
by -- that I think I
put on the handout.

875
00:52:54 --> 00:52:58
Yeah, new paper by Fitch and
Hauser where they basically

876
00:52:58 --> 00:53:04
were teaching grammatical
structures to primates, to

877
00:53:04 --> 00:53:06
non-human the primates.
 

878
00:53:06 --> 00:53:10
 
 

879
00:53:10 --> 00:53:11
They were pretty good.
 

880
00:53:11 --> 00:53:14
They were doing fine on the
John hit Mary is different

881
00:53:14 --> 00:53:16
from the Mary hit John part.
 

882
00:53:16 --> 00:53:20
But it was nested construction
that they simply

883
00:53:20 --> 00:53:23
never managed to get.
 

884
00:53:23 --> 00:53:31
So, Mary who was engaged
to Sam hit John.

885
00:53:31 --> 00:53:35
That's perfectly fine
for you, sticking one

886
00:53:35 --> 00:53:37
clause inside another.
 

887
00:53:37 --> 00:53:41
That was stuff that they could
just never manage to get their

888
00:53:41 --> 00:53:44
primates to pick up on.
 

889
00:53:44 --> 00:53:48
Now this is not an argument --
Hauser in particular is not

890
00:53:48 --> 00:53:53
somebody who spends a lot of
time arguing that apes are

891
00:53:53 --> 00:53:56
stupid or something like that.
 

892
00:53:56 --> 00:54:00
The great apes are
remarkably clever beasts.

893
00:54:00 --> 00:54:06
In studying them you find
cognitive abilities not

894
00:54:06 --> 00:54:09
unlike a lot of our
cognitive abilities.

895
00:54:09 --> 00:54:11
I don't think it's a Hauser
experiment, but one of the ones

896
00:54:11 --> 00:54:14
that comes to mind, that I
could have talked about in the

897
00:54:14 --> 00:54:18
context of egocentric behavior
before, is that important

898
00:54:18 --> 00:54:25
landmark in your mental
development was when you

899
00:54:25 --> 00:54:27
learned how to lie.
 

900
00:54:27 --> 00:54:29
 
 

901
00:54:29 --> 00:54:32
It's another one of these ones
that didn't necessarily get a

902
00:54:32 --> 00:54:35
lot of positive reinforcement
from your parents when you

903
00:54:35 --> 00:54:37
demonstrated it to them.
 

904
00:54:37 --> 00:54:39
But it is an important
cognitive landmark because it

905
00:54:39 --> 00:54:44
says I know that what's in
here is not what's in

906
00:54:44 --> 00:54:46
there, in your head.
 

907
00:54:46 --> 00:54:49
I could tell you something
that I know is bogus

908
00:54:49 --> 00:54:52
and you'll believe it.
 

909
00:54:52 --> 00:54:54
Monkeys can do that too.
 

910
00:54:54 --> 00:54:55
How do you know this?
 

911
00:54:55 --> 00:54:58
Well, I can't remember who did
the experiment, but he set up

912
00:54:58 --> 00:55:07
this clever experiment with a
good person and a bad person.

913
00:55:07 --> 00:55:11
The monkey knows both
of these people.

914
00:55:11 --> 00:55:22
Both of these people have
access to these boxes of stuff.

915
00:55:22 --> 00:55:24
The monkey sometimes has
access to the box of stuff.

916
00:55:24 --> 00:55:27
When the monkey gets access,
he can look under the box

917
00:55:27 --> 00:55:29
and he finds the banana.
 

918
00:55:29 --> 00:55:29
Oh, cool.
 

919
00:55:29 --> 00:55:30
Great.
 

920
00:55:30 --> 00:55:32
Or the grapes or there's
nothing under there,

921
00:55:32 --> 00:55:33
that's boring.
 

922
00:55:33 --> 00:55:36
Now the monkey's on the
other side of the cage

923
00:55:36 --> 00:55:38
and here's the stuff.
 

924
00:55:38 --> 00:55:42
If the good guy comes in, he
looks under one of these

925
00:55:42 --> 00:55:47
things, finds the banana and
he shares it with the monkey.

926
00:55:47 --> 00:55:51
If the bad guy comes in, looks,
finds the banana, he eats it

927
00:55:51 --> 00:55:54
and doesn't give
the monkey any.

928
00:55:54 --> 00:55:59
So now, do this a few times --
monkey's got this bit down.

929
00:55:59 --> 00:56:06
Now a third party comes in and
baits one of these two wells

930
00:56:06 --> 00:56:09
-- puts the banana
under one of them.

931
00:56:09 --> 00:56:15
Now if the good guy comes in
what does the monkey do?

932
00:56:15 --> 00:56:17
The monkey basically
says look there.

933
00:56:17 --> 00:56:20
You only get the look there,
that's where you want to look.

934
00:56:20 --> 00:56:23
The bad guy comes in,
what's the monkey do?

935
00:56:23 --> 00:56:27
Let's look there.
 

936
00:56:27 --> 00:56:30
Monkeys will also do
this to each other,

937
00:56:30 --> 00:56:32
apparently, in the wild.
 

938
00:56:32 --> 00:56:39
There's a version where you
stash stuff around a field and

939
00:56:39 --> 00:56:44
-- now how does it work that
the monkey lies to his friends?

940
00:56:44 --> 00:56:48
You arrange for monkey one
to discover the good stash.

941
00:56:48 --> 00:56:52
Then this monkey in some
fashion goes off and tells his

942
00:56:52 --> 00:56:54
buddies, go look over there --
the good stuff's over here.

943
00:56:54 --> 00:56:55
The monkey's, you
guys go over there.

944
00:56:55 --> 00:56:57
And he goes and eats
all the bananas.

945
00:56:57 --> 00:57:04
So, they're clever animals, but
there do seem to be fundamental

946
00:57:04 --> 00:57:08
differences that you
don't get around.

947
00:57:08 --> 00:57:11
At least nobody's figured out
how to get around them yet.

948
00:57:11 --> 00:57:17
Nobody has figured a way how to
get monkeys to anything like

949
00:57:17 --> 00:57:21
the richness of the grammar
that human language has.

950
00:57:21 --> 00:57:25
The result of this is that even
if you want to concede -- this

951
00:57:25 --> 00:57:27
is why you can answer both ways
to the do animals

952
00:57:27 --> 00:57:28
have language.
 

953
00:57:28 --> 00:57:32
Suppose you decide that all you
want is some evidence for

954
00:57:32 --> 00:57:36
phonemes, morphemes and an
ability to be sensitive

955
00:57:36 --> 00:57:37
to structure.
 

956
00:57:37 --> 00:57:40
Well, yeah, there's some
evidence that chimps can

957
00:57:40 --> 00:57:41
do that, for instance.
 

958
00:57:41 --> 00:57:46
But the hurdle of developing a
productive language, a language

959
00:57:46 --> 00:57:56
where you can say new stuff,
that does not seem to be a

960
00:57:56 --> 00:58:01
hurdle that any non-human
species gets over in either

961
00:58:01 --> 00:58:06
natural language or
in trained language.

962
00:58:06 --> 00:58:11
So, bees -- great sophisticated
stuff, but no evidence that the

963
00:58:11 --> 00:58:15
bee ever learns to talk about
anything new with this.

964
00:58:15 --> 00:58:18
The bee doesn't get to -- they
don't get to sit around and

965
00:58:18 --> 00:58:22
apparently muse about,
remember last year?

966
00:58:22 --> 00:58:28
Remember that patch of
flowers that was over there?

967
00:58:28 --> 00:58:31
At least nobody to my knowledge
has ever found the past

968
00:58:31 --> 00:58:33
tense in waggle or anything.
 

969
00:58:33 --> 00:58:39
It's their up to a
limit, but not further.

970
00:58:39 --> 00:58:45
Now, what I will do is take a
momentary break here, say a

971
00:58:45 --> 00:58:49
word about why does this
matter, and then what I'll do

972
00:58:49 --> 00:58:54
is entertain mid-term questions
for a few minutes before

973
00:58:54 --> 00:58:56
the end of the hour.
 

974
00:58:56 --> 00:58:59
So, take a quick stretch and
then let's come back and

975
00:58:59 --> 00:59:00
finish things up here.
 

976
00:59:00 --> 00:59:10
 
 

977
00:59:10 --> 00:59:14
Why does it matter?
 

978
00:59:14 --> 00:59:24
This has been a very
contentious topic, moreso than

979
00:59:24 --> 00:59:27
many -- people argue about
visual attention, but people

980
00:59:27 --> 00:59:32
don't get really agitated about
it like it's a moral issue.

981
00:59:32 --> 00:59:37
People get agitated about
animal language like it is a

982
00:59:37 --> 00:59:43
moral issue, because in some
fashion it is -- it is not

983
00:59:43 --> 00:59:47
itself a moral issue, but it
impinges on issues that have

984
00:59:47 --> 00:59:50
more to do with morality
than with science.

985
00:59:50 --> 00:59:53
Well, you could couch it in
theological terms, if you like.

986
00:59:53 --> 00:59:59
In Psalms, the psalmist asks
rhetorically at some point

987
00:59:59 --> 01:00:04
of God, What is man that
you are mindful of him?

988
01:00:04 --> 01:00:11
What is it that makes us so
special that we're different

989
01:00:11 --> 01:00:15
from all these animal
things out there.

990
01:00:15 --> 01:00:17
 
 

991
01:00:17 --> 01:00:23
That's the question that
becomes difficult if there is

992
01:00:23 --> 01:00:29
not at nice clean, qualitative
difference between what an

993
01:00:29 --> 01:00:32
animal is and what us is.
 

994
01:00:32 --> 01:00:38
This was one of the reasons why
the advent of the theory of

995
01:00:38 --> 01:00:45
evolution was so problematic
because it suggested that

996
01:00:45 --> 01:00:49
species were not completely
distinct and that we were

997
01:00:49 --> 01:00:52
somehow a completely separate
sort of creation, but that

998
01:00:52 --> 01:00:55
there was a continuity between
all forms of animal life

999
01:00:55 --> 01:00:59
up to and including us.
 

1000
01:00:59 --> 01:01:06
If that's the case, who is it
that gets the sort of rights

1001
01:01:06 --> 01:01:10
and privileges that we would
arrogate to ourselves, and who

1002
01:01:10 --> 01:01:15
is it that we get to
treat like animals?

1003
01:01:15 --> 01:01:18
The search for a nice clear --
I'm not going to give you the

1004
01:01:18 --> 01:01:21
answer to this because there
is, at least in my view, there

1005
01:01:21 --> 01:01:25
is no nice sharp, dividing line
that gives you a nice

1006
01:01:25 --> 01:01:26
clean answer to this.
 

1007
01:01:26 --> 01:01:29
But to search for a nice
clean answer could include,

1008
01:01:29 --> 01:01:32
well, who can talk to us?
 

1009
01:01:32 --> 01:01:37
Maybe the ability to speak or
communicate in a linguistic

1010
01:01:37 --> 01:01:39
way is the critical division.
 

1011
01:01:39 --> 01:01:41
Because I mean look, think
about it in terms of

1012
01:01:41 --> 01:01:43
what you would eat.
 

1013
01:01:43 --> 01:01:50
If it were the case that you'll
walk out into the field and the

1014
01:01:50 --> 01:01:55
cow can talk to you and carry
on a conversation, even sort of

1015
01:01:55 --> 01:01:58
a simple conversation, a
child-like conversation.

1016
01:01:58 --> 01:02:02
Good grass, like
grass, nice grass.

1017
01:02:02 --> 01:02:05
What's the chance that
you're going to eat him?

1018
01:02:05 --> 01:02:09
It doesn't feel quite
right anymore.

1019
01:02:09 --> 01:02:10
It's not just language.
 

1020
01:02:10 --> 01:02:13
We don't like to eat things
that we get to know.

1021
01:02:13 --> 01:02:17
Language is a good way to
get to know something.

1022
01:02:17 --> 01:02:21
Third grade at the moment
reading Charlotte's Web.

1023
01:02:21 --> 01:02:23
How many of you read
Charlotte's Web at some point?

1024
01:02:23 --> 01:02:26
Oh, good, it's still
a classic out there.

1025
01:02:26 --> 01:02:28
It's an issue about language
and who you're going

1026
01:02:28 --> 01:02:29
to get to eat.
 

1027
01:02:29 --> 01:02:36
There's a great one in the
little Jewish kid repertoire

1028
01:02:36 --> 01:02:42
called The Carp in the Bathtub
where a big -- a Carp is

1029
01:02:42 --> 01:02:45
basically an overgrown Goldfish
-- thing comes home and is

1030
01:02:45 --> 01:02:49
living in the bathtub and the
kids love it but this thing is

1031
01:02:49 --> 01:02:53
intended to be food, and sad
things happen to the Carp.

1032
01:02:53 --> 01:02:56
 
 

1033
01:02:56 --> 01:02:58
Things that are close to you
are not things that you want

1034
01:02:58 --> 01:03:02
to kill, not things that you
necessarily want to hurt.

1035
01:03:02 --> 01:03:10
So, how you draw that
line is important.

1036
01:03:10 --> 01:03:14
If you could argue that it is
absolutely the case that

1037
01:03:14 --> 01:03:18
there's human language ability
and animals just don't

1038
01:03:18 --> 01:03:19
got it at all--.
 

1039
01:03:19 --> 01:03:22
Another realm where this was
tried was humans are tool users

1040
01:03:22 --> 01:03:24
and animals just aren't.
 

1041
01:03:24 --> 01:03:25
There's a sharp division there.
 

1042
01:03:25 --> 01:03:26
We can see it.
 

1043
01:03:26 --> 01:03:29
It makes these sorts of
discussions somewhat easier.

1044
01:03:29 --> 01:03:32
It doesn't make them a
lot easier necessarily.

1045
01:03:32 --> 01:03:37
Because look, if you have a
human child who has a

1046
01:03:37 --> 01:03:41
congenital neurological problem
that means that that child will

1047
01:03:41 --> 01:03:45
never speak -- the kid's
mentally retarded in some

1048
01:03:45 --> 01:03:46
fashion, is never
going to speak.

1049
01:03:46 --> 01:03:49
That doesn't mean you can eat
him or anything of the sort.

1050
01:03:49 --> 01:03:52
That's obvious sick nonsense.
 

1051
01:03:52 --> 01:03:56
So it's not a simple division.
 

1052
01:03:56 --> 01:04:03
But the efforts to figure out
what makes us distinctively

1053
01:04:03 --> 01:04:12
human, and as a result, who do
human rights extend to is a

1054
01:04:12 --> 01:04:16
serious problem, one that I'm
not going to attempt to solve

1055
01:04:16 --> 01:04:22
here, but one that is certainly
worth your ongoing

1056
01:04:22 --> 01:04:23
consideration.
 

1057
01:04:23 --> 01:04:28
What I will attempt to solve
here for the remaining 10, 15

1058
01:04:28 --> 01:04:32
minutes or so, is I will
dutifully attempt to answer any

1059
01:04:32 --> 01:04:36
questions about the mid-term
that you might have at

1060
01:04:36 --> 01:04:37
the present moment.
 

1061
01:04:37 --> 01:04:45
 
 

1062
01:04:45 --> 01:04:50
A couple of people asked
me, is it a hard mid-term?

1063
01:04:50 --> 01:04:55
The answer is that the
first two TAs who read it,

1064
01:04:55 --> 01:04:58
said boy, this is easy.
 

1065
01:04:58 --> 01:05:03
The second two TAs who read
it, said boy, this is hard.

1066
01:05:03 --> 01:05:07
Sadly, the distinction between
the first two TAs and the

1067
01:05:07 --> 01:05:10
second two TAs in this case was
the first two TAs had TA'ed the

1068
01:05:10 --> 01:05:15
course last year and had been
through this once before

1069
01:05:15 --> 01:05:16
and the other ones hadn't.
 

1070
01:05:16 --> 01:05:19
So, you may use that
tidbit of information

1071
01:05:19 --> 01:05:21
in any way you see fit.
 

1072
01:05:21 --> 01:05:23
What other tidbits of
information can I

1073
01:05:23 --> 01:05:24
provide for you?
 

1074
01:05:24 --> 01:05:27
 
 

1075
01:05:27 --> 01:05:29
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].
 

1076
01:05:29 --> 01:05:32
PROFESSOR: The closed class
and open class words,

1077
01:05:32 --> 01:05:34
it's on today's handout.
 

1078
01:05:34 --> 01:05:38
I think I mentioned this last
time, but let me reiterate that

1079
01:05:38 --> 01:05:42
closed class, so it was on last
time so it's fair game

1080
01:05:42 --> 01:05:44
for the mid-term.
 

1081
01:05:44 --> 01:05:51
Closed class words are words
that serve grammaticals and

1082
01:05:51 --> 01:05:59
tactical roles and do not --
the, and, uh -- words that

1083
01:05:59 --> 01:06:02
don't have a definition in
any straightforward sense,

1084
01:06:02 --> 01:06:06
except to explain that the
means noun is a-comin'.

1085
01:06:06 --> 01:06:09
And means I'm joining a
couple of things together.

1086
01:06:09 --> 01:06:12
 
 

1087
01:06:12 --> 01:06:14
Open class words are
the other ones.

1088
01:06:14 --> 01:06:16
Closed class, it's a
much smaller set.

1089
01:06:16 --> 01:06:22
The closed class words are a
very small set and the open

1090
01:06:22 --> 01:06:25
class set is the set of all
other words that fill up the

1091
01:06:25 --> 01:06:27
dictionary and everything else.
 

1092
01:06:27 --> 01:06:29
 
 

1093
01:06:29 --> 01:06:32
So I think that's what you
need to know about that.

1094
01:06:32 --> 01:06:34
Oh, the other thing to know
about it is the closed class

1095
01:06:34 --> 01:06:36
words are what shows up when
you get beyond the two word

1096
01:06:36 --> 01:06:40
stage in language development.
 

1097
01:06:40 --> 01:06:45
Little kids, two word stage
kids don't say "the ball."

1098
01:06:45 --> 01:06:48
They say "Go ball" or
something like that.

1099
01:06:48 --> 01:06:55
But when they start to say
"I see the cat," longer

1100
01:06:55 --> 01:06:57
utterances, that's when you
start getting these closed

1101
01:06:57 --> 01:06:59
class things coming in.
 

1102
01:06:59 --> 01:07:02
OK, what else you need to know?
 

1103
01:07:02 --> 01:07:04
Everybody knows everything,
this is great.

1104
01:07:04 --> 01:07:04
What?
 

1105
01:07:04 --> 01:07:06
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].
 

1106
01:07:06 --> 01:07:12
 
 

1107
01:07:12 --> 01:07:15
PROFESSOR: If you look at the
exam from years past, the

1108
01:07:15 --> 01:07:16
mix roughly comparable.
 

1109
01:07:16 --> 01:07:21
I didn't actually check.
 

1110
01:07:21 --> 01:07:24
There's sort of an
interesting push-pull here.

1111
01:07:24 --> 01:07:28
The longer answers are worth 10
points, so if I write long

1112
01:07:28 --> 01:07:34
answer questions, I can get
done writing the exam faster.

1113
01:07:34 --> 01:07:35
I don't have to write
as many questions.

1114
01:07:35 --> 01:07:38
The short answer questions,
the multiple choice questions

1115
01:07:38 --> 01:07:40
are a lot easier to grade.
 

1116
01:07:40 --> 01:07:44
So if I write a lot of those
it's an easier test to grade,

1117
01:07:44 --> 01:07:50
and so the mix of those two
pressures leads me to sort

1118
01:07:50 --> 01:07:53
of the usual mix, I think.
 

1119
01:07:53 --> 01:07:55
It didn't look weird, did it?
 

1120
01:07:55 --> 01:07:56
No.
 

1121
01:07:56 --> 01:07:58
Kind of the usual,
some of each.

1122
01:07:58 --> 01:08:02
 
 

1123
01:08:02 --> 01:08:03
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]?
 

1124
01:08:03 --> 01:08:06
 
 

1125
01:08:06 --> 01:08:08
PROFESSOR: The ones of
you who come here will.

1126
01:08:08 --> 01:08:11
The ones who sleep late
-- at least it's taught

1127
01:08:11 --> 01:08:11
in the afternoon here.
 

1128
01:08:11 --> 01:08:14
Most of the people
make it awake.

1129
01:08:14 --> 01:08:16
Is the final in the morning
or in the afternoon?

1130
01:08:16 --> 01:08:17
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
 

1131
01:08:17 --> 01:08:19
PROFESSOR: Morning?
 

1132
01:08:19 --> 01:08:19
Afternoon.
 

1133
01:08:19 --> 01:08:20
Oh good.
 

1134
01:08:20 --> 01:08:23
Whenever it's in the morning
there's all these sad people

1135
01:08:23 --> 01:08:26
who traipse in an hour and a
half late with some great story

1136
01:08:26 --> 01:08:29
about I woke up when my alarm
clock woke me up but then I

1137
01:08:29 --> 01:08:32
went back to sleep and I had a
dream that I was awake

1138
01:08:32 --> 01:08:34
taking the exam.
 

1139
01:08:34 --> 01:08:39
Can't I get credit for the
answers I was writing?

1140
01:08:39 --> 01:08:40
Yeah, it's here.
 

1141
01:08:40 --> 01:08:40
It's here.
 

1142
01:08:40 --> 01:08:42
Everybody's taking it here.
 

1143
01:08:42 --> 01:08:46
Look, do me a favor, do your
best to put a seat between each

1144
01:08:46 --> 01:08:49
of you, and if you're not
putting a seat between each of

1145
01:08:49 --> 01:08:52
you because we've run out --
because there are 300 of

1146
01:08:52 --> 01:08:54
you and not 600 seats.
 

1147
01:08:54 --> 01:09:00
It's considered good form not
to take the exam like this,

1148
01:09:00 --> 01:09:02
particularly since the guy
sitting next you is probably

1149
01:09:02 --> 01:09:05
just as clueless as you are.
 

1150
01:09:05 --> 01:09:11
It's really, really
embarrassing when your wrong

1151
01:09:11 --> 01:09:13
answer is exactly the same
as the wrong answer

1152
01:09:13 --> 01:09:15
sitting next to you.
 

1153
01:09:15 --> 01:09:19
I mean it's OK on a multiple
choice thing, but this happened

1154
01:09:19 --> 01:09:21
-- actually, this happened to
me once upon a time

1155
01:09:21 --> 01:09:23
in grade school.
 

1156
01:09:23 --> 01:09:27
I was accused of plagiarizing
a report and they

1157
01:09:27 --> 01:09:30
showed it to me.
 

1158
01:09:30 --> 01:09:31
Here's this kid's report.
 

1159
01:09:31 --> 01:09:32
Here's your report.
 

1160
01:09:32 --> 01:09:34
These are identical.
 

1161
01:09:34 --> 01:09:36
Which was true.
 

1162
01:09:36 --> 01:09:40
And arrogant, smart kid that
I was, I said, do you think

1163
01:09:40 --> 01:09:44
I'd plagiarize from him?
 

1164
01:09:44 --> 01:09:46
It didn't take much of a brain
to figure out who'd plagiarize

1165
01:09:46 --> 01:09:50
from whom because this was a
kid who was still reading the

1166
01:09:50 --> 01:09:52
books with the print that you
could read across the room.

1167
01:09:52 --> 01:09:55
 
 

1168
01:09:55 --> 01:09:59
I wasn't going to plagiarize
his -- I was sort of flattered

1169
01:09:59 --> 01:10:01
that he took my paper I guess.
 

1170
01:10:01 --> 01:10:04
Does anybody actually have a
question I should answer here?

1171
01:10:04 --> 01:10:05
Yeah, all right.
 

1172
01:10:05 --> 01:10:07
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]?
 

1173
01:10:07 --> 01:10:08
PROFESSOR: Can I go over who?
 

1174
01:10:08 --> 01:10:10
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].
 

1175
01:10:10 --> 01:10:11
PROFESSOR: The logic
of perception.

1176
01:10:11 --> 01:10:17
Well, the logic of perception
is Irvin Rock's jargon for what

1177
01:10:17 --> 01:10:20
I was really talking about in
lecture, for instance,

1178
01:10:20 --> 01:10:23
as inference.
 

1179
01:10:23 --> 01:10:26
I think maybe in the book
also is Helmoltz's idea

1180
01:10:26 --> 01:10:27
of unconscious inference.
 

1181
01:10:27 --> 01:10:32
It's this idea that you're
continuously making the best

1182
01:10:32 --> 01:10:37
guess you can from an
impoverished stimulus.

1183
01:10:37 --> 01:10:45
That you've got a set of rules
built into that help you to try

1184
01:10:45 --> 01:10:50
to figure out what it is
that you're looking at.

1185
01:10:50 --> 01:10:55
There's more to Rock's argument
than that, but not much more

1186
01:10:55 --> 01:10:57
in the book, as I recall.
 

1187
01:10:57 --> 01:10:58
Something about like that.
 

1188
01:10:58 --> 01:11:01
There was another hand
over there a moment ago.

1189
01:11:01 --> 01:11:02
Well, now there's one here.
 

1190
01:11:02 --> 01:11:03
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]?
 

1191
01:11:03 --> 01:11:08
 
 

1192
01:11:08 --> 01:11:10
PROFESSOR: Lectures or books.
 

1193
01:11:10 --> 01:11:13
This is the triage question.
 

1194
01:11:13 --> 01:11:15
I haven't read the book, I
wasn't at the lectures,

1195
01:11:15 --> 01:11:19
now what do I do?
 

1196
01:11:19 --> 01:11:24
The answer is that the
intersection of book and

1197
01:11:24 --> 01:11:28
lecture is the best place
to devote your energy.

1198
01:11:28 --> 01:11:31
So things that were covered in
both are probably important

1199
01:11:31 --> 01:11:33
enough that -- well, they're
important enough that Gleitman

1200
01:11:33 --> 01:11:34
thought it was important and
I thought it was important.

1201
01:11:34 --> 01:11:37
That sounds important.
 

1202
01:11:37 --> 01:11:45
Beyond that, I used to say that
because I am as egocentric as

1203
01:11:45 --> 01:11:49
the next person, that things
that are in my lectures but not

1204
01:11:49 --> 01:11:51
the book are more likely to
show up than things that are in

1205
01:11:51 --> 01:11:53
the book but not
in the lecture.

1206
01:11:53 --> 01:11:58
But I'm not really sure
that's true anymore.

1207
01:11:58 --> 01:12:03
So I would say that after that,
if I was trying to figure out

1208
01:12:03 --> 01:12:08
how to ration my precious time,
I would look at the set of kind

1209
01:12:08 --> 01:12:12
of bullet questions that I put
on most of the handouts, until

1210
01:12:12 --> 01:12:16
I ran out of time, for
the chapter readings.

1211
01:12:16 --> 01:12:19
Because what you've got there
is what I think is important

1212
01:12:19 --> 01:12:24
in the chapter, and that's a
pretty good bet on things

1213
01:12:24 --> 01:12:27
that I might ask about.
 

1214
01:12:27 --> 01:12:32
I got no particular stake in
being arbitrarily evil and

1215
01:12:32 --> 01:12:36
saying can I find some really
teeny little piece of the book

1216
01:12:36 --> 01:12:41
that I can quiz you about
and eh-ha, nobody got it.

1217
01:12:41 --> 01:12:44
The amusement of that wears off
after the first 20 years of

1218
01:12:44 --> 01:12:47
teaching the course
it turns out.

1219
01:12:47 --> 01:12:52
So, another way of looking at
it is I tend to ask questions

1220
01:12:52 --> 01:12:55
-- when I'm going for stuff
that's just in the book, I

1221
01:12:55 --> 01:12:58
tend to go for stuff that's
covered in more than one

1222
01:12:58 --> 01:12:59
sentence in the book.
 

1223
01:12:59 --> 01:13:04
So if something is worth a page
to Gleitman, you might as well

1224
01:13:04 --> 01:13:10
pay more attention to that than
a passing figure caption.

1225
01:13:10 --> 01:13:12
All right, we'll take
one more back there.

1226
01:13:12 --> 01:13:14
AUDIENCE: Is the exam an
hour or an hour and a half?

1227
01:13:14 --> 01:13:14
PROFESSOR: Hour and a half.
 

1228
01:13:14 --> 01:13:17
 
 

1229
01:13:17 --> 01:13:20
You should know that it's no
longer than it used to be

1230
01:13:20 --> 01:13:22
when it was an hour long.
 

1231
01:13:22 --> 01:13:23
So you'll be fine.
 

1232
01:13:23 --> 01:13:25
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]?
 

1233
01:13:25 --> 01:13:27
PROFESSOR: What genre of
book is it based on?

1234
01:13:27 --> 01:13:28
Printed.
 

1235
01:13:28 --> 01:13:34
 
 

1236
01:13:34 --> 01:13:36
Good luck.
 

1237
01:13:36 --> 01:13:38
