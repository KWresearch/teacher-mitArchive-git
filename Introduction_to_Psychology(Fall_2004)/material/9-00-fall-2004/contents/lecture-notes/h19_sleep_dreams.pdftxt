Lecture 19 - Sleep and Dreams 
The Abstract: You spend about one third of your life asleep or, at least, you were built to
do so. Why? And what happens if you abuse the system? This lecture will focus on four
questions: 
1)  What does sleep behavior look like? How is it structured? 
2)  Why do we sleep? And what happens if we don't? 
3)  Why do we dream? 
4)  Can we extract any meaning from our dreams? 
The answers, in a nutshell, are: We were designed by nature to sleep in a consolidated
period of about 8 hours during the night. Within that 24 hour structure is another structure
that sends us into dreaming sleep every 90 minutes or so. We dream as a by product of the
biology. Freud didn't know the biology and had an elaborate theory of the role of dreams as
a safe venting of repressed wishes. It is possible to reconcile Freud's core ideas with
modern sleep research and we will try to do that by the end. 

Lecture Notes 

Why do you spend about 1/3 of your life in an altered state of consciousness? 
PART ONE: What does the behavior  look  like? 
The drive to sleep in driven by two (main) forces 
Force #1: Circadian rhythms 
Approx 24 hrs

How do we measure this? This picture shows running wheel activity in a mouse.
Each line is a day (plotted twice). Black = activity. The horizontal arrow shows the day on
which the light was turned on continuously.

Circadian rhythms can be
Entrained (to what?) 
or 
Free running (This mouse free runs with a cycle of about 23.5 hrs) 
How do we measure this in humans? 
Core body temp in humans 
Circulating hormones (e.g. melatonin) 
Force #2: Homeostatic sleep pressure 
= time awake (more or less) 
Bring these two together and you have a mechanism for producing 8 hrs sleep. 
The behavior changes with age: 
The national debt (sleep debt, that is) 
Many bad things are associated with sleepiness 
There is structure within sleep, too
