6
00:00:15 --> 00:00:16
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.
 

7
00:00:16 --> 00:00:22
 
 

8
00:00:22 --> 00:00:28
I decided to go for a little
amplification today because I'm

9
00:00:28 --> 00:00:34
feeling a little underpowered
and I think that if I do my

10
00:00:34 --> 00:00:42
usual unamplified version that
sometime around 3 o'clock I'll

11
00:00:42 --> 00:00:47
fall over and somebody will
have to haul me away.

12
00:00:47 --> 00:00:50
Actually, a lot of the
experiments I'm going to talk

13
00:00:50 --> 00:00:55
about today suggest that
you wouldn't do it.

14
00:00:55 --> 00:00:59
You'd just leave me in a little
heap there and slowly file out

15
00:00:59 --> 00:01:08
and I could try that
as like a demo.

16
00:01:08 --> 00:01:09
But that would be sad.
 

17
00:01:09 --> 00:01:13
So I don't think I'll do that,
but I will amplify myself in

18
00:01:13 --> 00:01:22
the effort not to run
out of steam here.

19
00:01:22 --> 00:01:30
When last we met I had setup
the Asch experiment-- that's

20
00:01:30 --> 00:01:36
the 3 line thing, the Milgram
experiment where it turned out

21
00:01:36 --> 00:01:44
that people would shock another
apparently innocent individual

22
00:01:44 --> 00:01:48
to a pretty severe degree
without what looked like an

23
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
awful lot of provocation.
 

24
00:01:50 --> 00:01:55
And then the manufacturers,
whatever it was, consultation--

25
00:01:55 --> 00:02:00
whatever it says on the
handout, that experiment

26
00:02:00 --> 00:02:03
suggested that under other
circumstances people wouldn't

27
00:02:03 --> 00:02:09
be so willing to comply with a
suggestion that would

28
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
run against what they
would normally do.

29
00:02:11 --> 00:02:16
And I left it there to say that
we'll come back today and

30
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
talk about why that must be.
 

31
00:02:18 --> 00:02:19
Why that might be the case.
 

32
00:02:19 --> 00:02:25
And the context in which I want
to talk about that is the

33
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
social impact theory.
 

34
00:02:27 --> 00:02:30
 
 

35
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
The source I put on the handout
out is-- the guy's got a great

36
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
name-- his name is Bibb Latane.
 

37
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
It looks like Latane, but
you pronounce it Latane

38
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
and the B stands for Bibb.
 

39
00:02:40 --> 00:02:45
I don't know who names their
kid Bibb, but maybe that's how

40
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
you grow up to be a famous
social psychologist.

41
00:02:47 --> 00:02:51
 
 

42
00:02:51 --> 00:02:57
So when you're studying for the
final you can remind yourself

43
00:02:57 --> 00:03:02
that social impact is a
function of SIN, but

44
00:03:02 --> 00:03:04
that's just the acronym.
 

45
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
I don't know that Latane every
particularly noticed this, but

46
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
that's the acronym for his 3
big factors in this theory of

47
00:03:09 --> 00:03:14
strength, immediacy,
and number.

48
00:03:14 --> 00:03:17
And what I want to do is try to
explain those in the context,

49
00:03:17 --> 00:03:19
particularly at the
Milgram experiment.

50
00:03:19 --> 00:03:26
See how those speak to the
question of when it is that you

51
00:03:26 --> 00:03:33
will give into the social
pressures from the outside.

52
00:03:33 --> 00:03:38
So strength in this case refers
to-- well, in the Milgram case

53
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
really, it would be the
authority of the guy giving

54
00:03:42 --> 00:03:43
you the instructions.
 

55
00:03:43 --> 00:03:47
Remember that all the subjects
in Milgram's experiment were

56
00:03:47 --> 00:03:51
upset by the notion that they
should be shocking somebody.

57
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
And shocking them
apparently, severely.

58
00:03:53 --> 00:03:59
And Milgram had trained himself
to say, please continue.

59
00:03:59 --> 00:04:00
The experiment must go on.
 

60
00:04:00 --> 00:04:01
And not more than that.
 

61
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
He wasn't going to get into an
argument with them, he was

62
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
just going to say that.
 

63
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
If the guy's saying,
please continue.

64
00:04:08 --> 00:04:14
The experiment must go on is
Stanley Milgram, white-jacketed

65
00:04:14 --> 00:04:19
scientist professor from Yale,
you got 63% of people going

66
00:04:19 --> 00:04:23
through all the way to 450
volts in that experiment.

67
00:04:23 --> 00:04:27
But if you made a small
change in the experiment

68
00:04:27 --> 00:04:34
and the person running
it was just some guy.

69
00:04:34 --> 00:04:36
You know, Kristen
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

70
00:04:36 --> 00:04:39
well-intentioned research
assistant in the lab or

71
00:04:39 --> 00:04:43
something like that,
compliance dropped to 20%.

72
00:04:43 --> 00:04:44
I don't know.
 

73
00:04:44 --> 00:04:45
I'm sure actually if Kristen
was doing it, compliance

74
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
would be like 100%.
 

75
00:04:47 --> 00:04:51
Because she'd smack them around
and stuff like that, but if it

76
00:04:51 --> 00:04:57
was not an authority figure, if
the person giving you the

77
00:04:57 --> 00:05:02
instruction was a person with
less authority compliance

78
00:05:02 --> 00:05:03
dropped way down.
 

79
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
That is the sort of thing that
the military knows, right?

80
00:05:05 --> 00:05:07
Who gives you the order
makes a difference.

81
00:05:07 --> 00:05:09
 
 

82
00:05:09 --> 00:05:17
Immediacy refers to the
vividness of the factors.

83
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
Sort of the salience
of the factors here.

84
00:05:19 --> 00:05:22
So I already talked about
one immediacy manipulation.

85
00:05:22 --> 00:05:25
Remember, in the original
version of the experiment 100%

86
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
of the people went all the
way through to 450 volts.

87
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
Milgram figured,
oh my goodness.

88
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
That's because they didn't buy
the story at all and he brought

89
00:05:33 --> 00:05:40
the learner slash victim into
sight and into the range of

90
00:05:40 --> 00:05:45
hearing and that change in the
immediacy-- increasing the

91
00:05:45 --> 00:05:47
vividness of the impact you
were having on this other

92
00:05:47 --> 00:05:53
person decreased compliance
from 100 to about 2/3

93
00:05:53 --> 00:05:57
of the population.
 

94
00:05:57 --> 00:06:04
If you manipulate the vividness
of the pressure on the subject,

95
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
compliance can change.
 

96
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
So if Milgram is right there
saying, please continue.

97
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
The experiment must go on.
 

98
00:06:11 --> 00:06:12
You went on.
 

99
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
But if you said, look, I got
a rinse a few things out.

100
00:06:15 --> 00:06:19
I'll be down in my office, if
you got any questions about

101
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
the experiment call me.
 

102
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
So you know, I have
a heart attack.

103
00:06:23 --> 00:06:28
You know, the learner is busy
making all of its bad noises.

104
00:06:28 --> 00:06:29
The subject is getting antsy.
 

105
00:06:29 --> 00:06:30
He picks up the phone.
 

106
00:06:30 --> 00:06:31
Please continue.
 

107
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
The experiment must go on.
 

108
00:06:34 --> 00:06:35
Yeah, right.
 

109
00:06:35 --> 00:06:38
Compliance dropped
again to 20%.

110
00:06:38 --> 00:06:42
So big drop in compliance if
the source of the authority

111
00:06:42 --> 00:06:47
was not right there
to help you out.

112
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
And if you make the
consequences even more vivid,

113
00:06:50 --> 00:06:52
you can again drop compliance
in this experiment.

114
00:06:52 --> 00:06:56
So in one particularly vivid
version of Milgram's

115
00:06:56 --> 00:07:00
experiment, Milgram didn't
have the learner off

116
00:07:00 --> 00:07:01
in another booth.
 

117
00:07:01 --> 00:07:07
He had the learner right next
to you making his noises.

118
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
And at a critical time in the
experiment the electrode is

119
00:07:09 --> 00:07:13
slipping off the guy's hand
and Milgram says, hold

120
00:07:13 --> 00:07:16
the electrode on him.
 

121
00:07:16 --> 00:07:18
And he's still doing
the same thing, right?

122
00:07:18 --> 00:07:19
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

123
00:07:19 --> 00:07:20
I'm not going to
respond anymore.

124
00:07:20 --> 00:07:21
I quit.
 

125
00:07:21 --> 00:07:23
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

126
00:07:23 --> 00:07:26
Compliance drops, you'll
be glad to know.

127
00:07:26 --> 00:07:28
What you may be a little
distressed to know is

128
00:07:28 --> 00:07:30
it drops only to 30%.
 

129
00:07:30 --> 00:07:35
30% of the people were still
willing to deliver these

130
00:07:35 --> 00:07:38
punitive shocks all the way
through to the end even when

131
00:07:38 --> 00:07:45
they're holding the guy's
hands down on the electrode.

132
00:07:45 --> 00:07:50
It's this immediacy factor that
makes it psychologically easier

133
00:07:50 --> 00:07:55
to shoot a missile over the
horizon and kill somebody than

134
00:07:55 --> 00:07:58
to actually look somebody
in the eye and kill them.

135
00:07:58 --> 00:08:01
They're dead the same way in
either case, you may know

136
00:08:01 --> 00:08:03
objectively that they're dead.
 

137
00:08:03 --> 00:08:07
This is a real issue
for the military.

138
00:08:07 --> 00:08:12
The military knows that it is
in the unfortunate business of

139
00:08:12 --> 00:08:16
killing other people and it
also knows that in a way, much

140
00:08:16 --> 00:08:18
more profound of course than
the Milgram experiment that

141
00:08:18 --> 00:08:23
this is very upsetting
to its own soldiers.

142
00:08:23 --> 00:08:28
To say nothing of the people
who get killed, but people

143
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
don't like killing other
people, typically.

144
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
It takes work to get somebody
to kill other people and it's

145
00:08:34 --> 00:08:40
psychologically less damaging
if it's over the horizon

146
00:08:40 --> 00:08:41
than if it's face-to-face.
 

147
00:08:41 --> 00:08:48
Though, all you need to do is
watch the latest video of some

148
00:08:48 --> 00:08:52
charming person slitting
somebody's throat-- some

149
00:08:52 --> 00:08:54
hostages throat in Iraq-- to
realize that it is also

150
00:08:54 --> 00:08:58
perfectly possible to kill
somebody right there.

151
00:08:58 --> 00:09:02
But there is an immediacy
effect, a real world

152
00:09:02 --> 00:09:04
immediacy effect.
 

153
00:09:04 --> 00:09:09
Well, that's perhaps a gruesome
one then and you might think

154
00:09:09 --> 00:09:12
this is only stuff that works
in the realm of the

155
00:09:12 --> 00:09:13
truly horrible.
 

156
00:09:13 --> 00:09:15
That's not true either.
 

157
00:09:15 --> 00:09:21
 
 

158
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
Suppose I get curious this
evening and I send a note

159
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
around saying, what do you
think of the Milgram

160
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
experiment?
 

161
00:09:29 --> 00:09:31
I might get an e-mail back.
 

162
00:09:31 --> 00:09:33
I wouldn't bet on it.
 

163
00:09:33 --> 00:09:34
Maybe a couple.
 

164
00:09:34 --> 00:09:36
I know who would be
sending them too by

165
00:09:36 --> 00:09:39
this point in the term.
 

166
00:09:39 --> 00:09:42
If I ask right now, well,
what do you think about

167
00:09:42 --> 00:09:42
the Milgram experiment?
 

168
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
Is that a disturbing
experiment?

169
00:09:45 --> 00:09:48
Few people will
nod their heads.

170
00:09:48 --> 00:09:52
The eastern bloc might
raise its hand.

171
00:09:52 --> 00:09:59
But you know, most of you will
successfully sit on your

172
00:09:59 --> 00:10:00
hands and not do anything.
 

173
00:10:00 --> 00:10:04
But you know, if I was to
wander over here somewhere--

174
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
she's getting very
nervous here.

175
00:10:06 --> 00:10:08
You can see the
experiment really works.

176
00:10:08 --> 00:10:11
And if I was to ask, what
do you think of the

177
00:10:11 --> 00:10:12
Milgram experiment?
 

178
00:10:12 --> 00:10:16
I won't actually make her
respond, but I could, right?

179
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
There's no doubt.
 

180
00:10:18 --> 00:10:21
The only person capable of
not responding under those

181
00:10:21 --> 00:10:25
circumstances would be my
15 year-old son, right?

182
00:10:25 --> 00:10:27
You have perfected this within
the realm of your own family,

183
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
why did you get that grade?
 

184
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
 
 

185
00:10:32 --> 00:10:35
But under other circumstances
the social impact, the social

186
00:10:35 --> 00:10:41
pressure there is so strong by
the time it's all directed at

187
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
you that you got to respond.
 

188
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
You can feel that
social pressure.

189
00:10:46 --> 00:10:47
Actually, it was a
great experiment.

190
00:10:47 --> 00:10:51
This was a great experiment
because several people thought

191
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
I might be headed their way.
 

192
00:10:53 --> 00:10:58
And I caught these great
fleeting looks of relief from

193
00:10:58 --> 00:11:00
that side of the aisle when
they realized, he's

194
00:11:00 --> 00:11:01
going that way.
 

195
00:11:01 --> 00:11:05
 
 

196
00:11:05 --> 00:11:06
That's immediacy.
 

197
00:11:06 --> 00:11:09
That's also actually, an
illustration of the effect

198
00:11:09 --> 00:11:16
of this third factor,
which is number.

199
00:11:16 --> 00:11:18
In the Milgram experiment
this was not manipulated.

200
00:11:18 --> 00:11:22
Milgram experiment is a
one-on-one experiment.

201
00:11:22 --> 00:11:25
There's Milgram or his
surrogate exerting pressure

202
00:11:25 --> 00:11:27
on you, the subject.
 

203
00:11:27 --> 00:11:31
In that manufacturers
consultants' study or in the

204
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
Asch experiment, it is
manipulated and you find that

205
00:11:34 --> 00:11:39
the more people that the
authority is trying to spread

206
00:11:39 --> 00:11:44
his impact over, the less the
impact on any given individual.

207
00:11:44 --> 00:11:51
Similarly here, if I ask you,
300 of you, what do you think?

208
00:11:51 --> 00:11:54
Each of you gets-- I don't know
if this is actually a linear

209
00:11:54 --> 00:12:02
operation-- but roughly,
1/300 of my impact.

210
00:12:02 --> 00:12:06
But if I go and find her she
gets all the impact and

211
00:12:06 --> 00:12:08
she has to say something.
 

212
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
Actually, I think, that we
could probably work out the

213
00:12:10 --> 00:12:14
equations here because there's
also probably a distance

214
00:12:14 --> 00:12:15
equation, right?
 

215
00:12:15 --> 00:12:19
You know there are people, you
out there in the cheap seats

216
00:12:19 --> 00:12:23
know there are people who sit
out in the back because the

217
00:12:23 --> 00:12:26
possibilities of social
impact are less out there.

218
00:12:26 --> 00:12:29
I can do what I want out
there in the cheap seats.

219
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
He can't see anything anyway.
 

220
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
Look at all those computers
up there, they're all

221
00:12:33 --> 00:12:34
surfing the web anyway.
 

222
00:12:34 --> 00:12:41
 
 

223
00:12:41 --> 00:12:44
But I don't know that anybody's
ever looked at the distance

224
00:12:44 --> 00:12:50
effects in any sort
of a direct way.

225
00:12:50 --> 00:12:56
There's a very nice study done
at Ohio State some years

226
00:12:56 --> 00:12:59
ago during Greek Week.
 

227
00:12:59 --> 00:13:03
What the experimenters did was
they hung out backstage because

228
00:13:03 --> 00:13:07
at Greek Week at Ohio State
what you had to do was your

229
00:13:07 --> 00:13:11
fraternity had to get up in
front of all these people,

230
00:13:11 --> 00:13:13
like a big stadium full of
people and do something.

231
00:13:13 --> 00:13:17
Typically, something kind of
embarrassing to show how cool

232
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
you were and why everybody
should join your fraternity.

233
00:13:19 --> 00:13:23
And what the experimenters
noticed was that the number

234
00:13:23 --> 00:13:29
of guys in the group varied.
 

235
00:13:29 --> 00:13:32
You know, you sent out your one
guy or you sent out this troop

236
00:13:32 --> 00:13:34
of 10 guys to do something.
 

237
00:13:34 --> 00:13:36
And so what they did was
they simply asked people

238
00:13:36 --> 00:13:40
before they got on stage,
how nervous are you?

239
00:13:40 --> 00:13:45
And the answer was, it was
monotonically related to

240
00:13:45 --> 00:13:46
the number of people.
 

241
00:13:46 --> 00:13:50
If it was just you, you felt
much more nervous than if there

242
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
were 10 guys going out there.
 

243
00:13:52 --> 00:13:57
Now there's no real
rational basis for that.

244
00:13:57 --> 00:14:00
You're not going to get hurt
out there, but if you imagine

245
00:14:00 --> 00:14:03
that everybody in that stadium
had a tomato you can kind

246
00:14:03 --> 00:14:07
of understand the social
impact version of this.

247
00:14:07 --> 00:14:10
How many tomatoes are going
to hit you if there's just

248
00:14:10 --> 00:14:11
one of you verses if
there's 10 of you.

249
00:14:11 --> 00:14:16
It's going to diffuse in
this case, very literal

250
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
sort of impact.
 

251
00:14:18 --> 00:14:22
 
 

252
00:14:22 --> 00:14:31
Social impact theory has one
of its roots actually in a

253
00:14:31 --> 00:14:40
lurid and media- circus
murder from the 60's.

254
00:14:40 --> 00:14:43
In fact, a murder that I
remember because it happened

255
00:14:43 --> 00:14:47
in New York City when I was
growing up in the New Jersey

256
00:14:47 --> 00:14:50
suburbs and so it got
a lot of coverage.

257
00:14:50 --> 00:14:53
This was the murder of a woman
named Kitty Genovese, who was

258
00:14:53 --> 00:14:56
murdered in the courtyard of
her fairly large

259
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
apartment block.
 

260
00:14:58 --> 00:15:01
And it wasn't a quick business.
 

261
00:15:01 --> 00:15:05
The guy stabbed her and she
sort of crawled off into the

262
00:15:05 --> 00:15:11
bushes and she didn't die and
he came back and he finished.

263
00:15:11 --> 00:15:12
It was gross.
 

264
00:15:12 --> 00:15:15
You know, just
disgusting murder.

265
00:15:15 --> 00:15:19
And the reason gross disgusting
murders I mean, there are whole

266
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
New York radio stations
devoted to that.

267
00:15:21 --> 00:15:24
The reason this was a
particularly salient one was it

268
00:15:24 --> 00:15:29
was clear afterwards that there
were at least 40 or so people

269
00:15:29 --> 00:15:33
who had heard this and nobody
had called the police, let

270
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
alone intervene directly.
 

271
00:15:35 --> 00:15:39
Nobody had called and this
generated a whole lot of sort

272
00:15:39 --> 00:15:45
of media brow beating and stuff
about, was it the case that New

273
00:15:45 --> 00:15:50
Yorkers were just cold,
heartless individuals?

274
00:15:50 --> 00:15:51
Or what?
 

275
00:15:51 --> 00:15:56
And rather like the Milgram
experiment being motivated by

276
00:15:56 --> 00:16:04
the question of, were the Nazis
special in some evil sense?

277
00:16:04 --> 00:16:09
Some of this work on social
impact theory was based on the

278
00:16:09 --> 00:16:14
hypothesis that no, that this
didn't illustrate the cruel,

279
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
heartless nature
of New Yorkers.

280
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
What it illustrated was what
happens when you're on the

281
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
losing end up of what
boils down to a social

282
00:16:21 --> 00:16:23
impact experiment.
 

283
00:16:23 --> 00:16:30
The problem was that she was
diffusing her impact across

284
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
this whole apartment building
and when you interviewed

285
00:16:32 --> 00:16:35
people, people said over and
over again, I thought somebody

286
00:16:35 --> 00:16:36
else would have called.
 

287
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
I wasn't quite sure
what was happening.

288
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
Somebody else would have
had a better look.

289
00:16:42 --> 00:16:47
They figured that somebody else
would have taken care of it.

290
00:16:47 --> 00:16:49
 
 

291
00:16:49 --> 00:16:56
The notion is that had this
been taking place in the front

292
00:16:56 --> 00:17:00
yard of your isolated farmstead
on the Great Plains or

293
00:17:00 --> 00:17:03
something like that, you
would've done something.

294
00:17:03 --> 00:17:05
Because you would have known
nobody else could have.

295
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
Is there any evidence for this?
 

296
00:17:07 --> 00:17:09
Well, yes actually.
 

297
00:17:09 --> 00:17:12
John Darley, who was one of my
professors at Princeton, and

298
00:17:12 --> 00:17:16
Latane, who worked with him,
did a series of beautiful

299
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
experiments on this.
 

300
00:17:19 --> 00:17:21
Obviously they didn't go around
murdering people in courtyards,

301
00:17:21 --> 00:17:28
but what they did was you'd
come into the lab and lab had a

302
00:17:28 --> 00:17:30
whole bunch of isolation
booths in it.

303
00:17:30 --> 00:17:32
Because except if you're
in a weird experiment

304
00:17:32 --> 00:17:34
like that Asch three
 

305
00:17:34 --> 00:17:40
line experiment you want
to have people doing

306
00:17:40 --> 00:17:41
the experiment alone.
 

307
00:17:41 --> 00:17:48
So a lot of labs are setup this
way and so, you, the subject,

308
00:17:48 --> 00:17:51
would go into this little
booth to do the experiment.

309
00:17:51 --> 00:17:53
And then something
would happen.

310
00:17:53 --> 00:18:00
For instance, you'd
hear crash and help.

311
00:18:00 --> 00:18:02
And the question was, who cares
what you're doing in the booth?

312
00:18:02 --> 00:18:05
The only interesting question
in this experiment is,

313
00:18:05 --> 00:18:08
how fast do you come out
of the booth to help?

314
00:18:08 --> 00:18:12
The answer is it depends
on how many other booths

315
00:18:12 --> 00:18:14
you think are occupied.
 

316
00:18:14 --> 00:18:16
And of course, Darley and
Latane made very sure that

317
00:18:16 --> 00:18:18
you knew exactly how many
booths were occupied.

318
00:18:18 --> 00:18:22
So if it was the case that you
knew that you were all alone

319
00:18:22 --> 00:18:28
you were out there fast because
the impact was on you.

320
00:18:28 --> 00:18:30
If there was going to
be any help around it

321
00:18:30 --> 00:18:31
was going to be you.
 

322
00:18:31 --> 00:18:35
 
 

323
00:18:35 --> 00:18:38
If the booth was full-- if you
knew that there were six other

324
00:18:38 --> 00:18:41
people in the experiment you
were slower to come out

325
00:18:41 --> 00:18:44
because well, I'm not the
biggest, strongest guy.

326
00:18:44 --> 00:18:47
Somebody else will help and
I didn't take that Red

327
00:18:47 --> 00:18:50
Cross course or whatever.
 

328
00:18:50 --> 00:18:54
The responsibility
gets diffused across

329
00:18:54 --> 00:18:55
multiple people.
 

330
00:18:55 --> 00:18:58
It's not just for helping.
 

331
00:18:58 --> 00:19:00
In another one of their
entertaining versions,

332
00:19:00 --> 00:19:03
smoke comes into the lab.
 

333
00:19:03 --> 00:19:05
How fast do you
get out of there?

334
00:19:05 --> 00:19:08
If you're alone, you're moving.
 

335
00:19:08 --> 00:19:15
If you're not alone, you're
thinking, he's not moving.

336
00:19:15 --> 00:19:18
He must know something
I don't know.

337
00:19:18 --> 00:19:20
And if he's not moving
it's going to be

338
00:19:20 --> 00:19:21
embarrassing, right?
 

339
00:19:21 --> 00:19:24
If I go, fire!
 

340
00:19:24 --> 00:19:24
Fire!
 

341
00:19:24 --> 00:19:24
And I go running around.
 

342
00:19:24 --> 00:19:27
Everybody's going to think
I'm a complete doofus.

343
00:19:27 --> 00:19:31
Now the downside, this is a
beautiful experiment showing

344
00:19:31 --> 00:19:34
beautiful social impact
effect-- the downside of this

345
00:19:34 --> 00:19:38
was this was done at Princeton
where I eventually showed up as

346
00:19:38 --> 00:19:43
an undergraduate to do my nice
boring research on

347
00:19:43 --> 00:19:45
visual perception.
 

348
00:19:45 --> 00:19:49
None of my subjects ever
believed that I was doing a

349
00:19:49 --> 00:19:51
visual perception experiment.
 

350
00:19:51 --> 00:19:53
It didn't help that the room I
had was one of these rooms with

351
00:19:53 --> 00:19:56
a half silvered mirror in it.
 

352
00:19:56 --> 00:19:58
So that I could look in and
they couldn't look out.

353
00:19:58 --> 00:20:01
I didn't care I was planning
to look in, it was left over

354
00:20:01 --> 00:20:03
from the social psych guys.
 

355
00:20:03 --> 00:20:05
But nobody ever believed I was
there to do a regular just

356
00:20:05 --> 00:20:08
straight up and down-- I just
want to know what color it

357
00:20:08 --> 00:20:10
looks like experiment.
 

358
00:20:10 --> 00:20:13
They all figured, you're
watching me, right?

359
00:20:13 --> 00:20:17
Something weird's
going to happen here.

360
00:20:17 --> 00:20:21
Oh, along those lines, didn't
happen to me, but a word to the

361
00:20:21 --> 00:20:30
wise should you ever find
yourself in an experiment in

362
00:20:30 --> 00:20:34
one of these rooms that looks
like one wall is mirrored.

363
00:20:34 --> 00:20:36
If you're in a psych lab
it's probably a half

364
00:20:36 --> 00:20:38
silvered mirror.
 

365
00:20:38 --> 00:20:41
The implication of a half
silvered mirror is that that's

366
00:20:41 --> 00:20:44
not a mirror that you want
to use to readjust large

367
00:20:44 --> 00:20:47
parts of your anatomy.
 

368
00:20:47 --> 00:20:49
 
 

369
00:20:49 --> 00:20:51
It was a great story.
 

370
00:20:51 --> 00:20:57
The poor grad student was
embarrassed for life.

371
00:20:57 --> 00:21:01
He was a very, kind of straight
up and down squarish kind of

372
00:21:01 --> 00:21:06
guy and anyway, it was
very embarrassing.

373
00:21:06 --> 00:21:09
The grad student was the
observer here and it

374
00:21:09 --> 00:21:10
was embarrassing.
 

375
00:21:10 --> 00:21:11
So don't do that.
 

376
00:21:11 --> 00:21:12
You don't want to
embarrass people.

377
00:21:12 --> 00:21:15
 
 

378
00:21:15 --> 00:21:21
Oh, one last example, closer to
a real world example of this,

379
00:21:21 --> 00:21:25
the great I think, it's another
Darley and Latane, liquor

380
00:21:25 --> 00:21:25
store experiment.
 

381
00:21:25 --> 00:21:27
You go into a liquor store.
 

382
00:21:27 --> 00:21:28
You're hanging out in
the liquor store.

383
00:21:28 --> 00:21:31
These two guys come in, they
ask the guy in the liquor

384
00:21:31 --> 00:21:35
store, do you have
any [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

385
00:21:35 --> 00:21:37
weird beer, some weird beer.
 

386
00:21:37 --> 00:21:41
The liquor store guy says,
I don't have it up here.

387
00:21:41 --> 00:21:43
I might have some in the
basement and he takes

388
00:21:43 --> 00:21:44
off for the basement.
 

389
00:21:44 --> 00:21:50
As soon as he's gone the two
guys look at the case of Bud,

390
00:21:50 --> 00:21:53
say, haha, he'll
never miss this.

391
00:21:53 --> 00:21:56
Pick up the case
of Bud and leave.

392
00:21:56 --> 00:21:59
The guy comes up from
the basement and asks,

393
00:21:59 --> 00:22:00
where are those guys?
 

394
00:22:00 --> 00:22:03
And the question is,
everybody's a stooge

395
00:22:03 --> 00:22:06
in this experiment of
course except you.

396
00:22:06 --> 00:22:08
The question is,
what do you say?

397
00:22:08 --> 00:22:15
The answer is, if you are all
alone 2/3 of you say, the

398
00:22:15 --> 00:22:19
guys-- they like
stole the beer.

399
00:22:19 --> 00:22:25
But if you're with even one
other person that drops to 1/3.

400
00:22:25 --> 00:22:28
Again, because of this
diffusion of responsibility,

401
00:22:28 --> 00:22:31
you say to yourself,
unconsciously, implicitly, or

402
00:22:31 --> 00:22:35
whatever-- if he's not saying
anything, why should

403
00:22:35 --> 00:22:36
I say something?
 

404
00:22:36 --> 00:22:39
And so you're less likely
to say something.

405
00:22:39 --> 00:22:42
Now the one good side of
this, this is all sort

406
00:22:42 --> 00:22:43
of depressing, right?
 

407
00:22:43 --> 00:22:45
It sort of suggests that if
we're going to hang out in

408
00:22:45 --> 00:22:48
large social groups, one of
the downsides of this is that

409
00:22:48 --> 00:22:50
we're not going to look after
each other terribly well.

410
00:22:50 --> 00:22:54
There's a useful inoculation
effect here and I've

411
00:22:54 --> 00:22:55
just inoculated you.
 

412
00:22:55 --> 00:22:58
The fact that you know about
this, there are experiments

413
00:22:58 --> 00:23:01
suggesting that the fact that
you know about this makes you

414
00:23:01 --> 00:23:06
more likely, the next time the
occasion arrives to discount

415
00:23:06 --> 00:23:08
the number of other
people there.

416
00:23:08 --> 00:23:16
So now it is probably the case
that if I do keel over somebody

417
00:23:16 --> 00:23:20
will rescue me, even though
the responsibility for this

418
00:23:20 --> 00:23:21
has been diffused across.
 

419
00:23:21 --> 00:23:23
Of course, the reason is
because somebody's going

420
00:23:23 --> 00:23:25
to think it's a fake.
 

421
00:23:25 --> 00:23:27
And they think, I'm going
to win the prize if I

422
00:23:27 --> 00:23:31
collect him or something.
 

423
00:23:31 --> 00:23:33
But I'll try not to do
the experiment at all.

424
00:23:33 --> 00:23:36
But in any case, there is
evidence that once you know

425
00:23:36 --> 00:23:44
about these things you're less
vulnerable to those effects

426
00:23:44 --> 00:23:48
and less likely to find
yourself complying with an

427
00:23:48 --> 00:23:51
instruction that's wrong.
 

428
00:23:51 --> 00:23:56
I mean, look, you probably have
a good intuitive feeling and I

429
00:23:56 --> 00:24:02
hope you're right that all over
Iraq now, if you're holding

430
00:24:02 --> 00:24:06
prisoners you've now been
inoculated against doing a

431
00:24:06 --> 00:24:08
whole round of stupid things.
 

432
00:24:08 --> 00:24:12
When the Abu Ghraib broke every
social psychologist in the

433
00:24:12 --> 00:24:17
country was on some talking
heads show on national public

434
00:24:17 --> 00:24:19
radio saying, we
knew about this.

435
00:24:19 --> 00:24:21
We can explain this because
that's exactly the sort of

436
00:24:21 --> 00:24:25
thing that's understandable
in the context of these

437
00:24:25 --> 00:24:26
sorts of experiments.
 

438
00:24:26 --> 00:24:29
People doing things that they
would never-- you know, what's

439
00:24:29 --> 00:24:32
the chance that you were back
home before going off to Iraq

440
00:24:32 --> 00:24:33
saying, I'm going
to go to Iraq.

441
00:24:33 --> 00:24:35
I'm going to get me some
prisoners, put them in

442
00:24:35 --> 00:24:39
compromising sexual positions
and get photos sent back home.

443
00:24:39 --> 00:24:44
No, nobody thinks about doing
that, but the social situation

444
00:24:44 --> 00:24:47
that you find yourself in with
perhaps an implicit command

445
00:24:47 --> 00:24:52
from somebody that
loosens things up a bit

446
00:24:52 --> 00:24:54
produced the effect.
 

447
00:24:54 --> 00:24:58
The fact that this was a
disaster has presumably now

448
00:24:58 --> 00:25:01
inoculated the system at least
in the short-term against

449
00:25:01 --> 00:25:04
it happening again, at
least we may hope so.

450
00:25:04 --> 00:25:10
 
 

451
00:25:10 --> 00:25:12
The practical sort of
questions, like what do you do

452
00:25:12 --> 00:25:17
about prisoner abuse are one
interesting line that grows

453
00:25:17 --> 00:25:19
from this sort of work.
 

454
00:25:19 --> 00:25:24
Another question, returning
perhaps to this sort of more

455
00:25:24 --> 00:25:27
basic, psychological side of
things is what I think I

456
00:25:27 --> 00:25:31
labeled on that handout as-- oh
yes, the fundamental question.

457
00:25:31 --> 00:25:34
I decided if you could have the
fundamental attribution error

458
00:25:34 --> 00:25:37
that I would invent for
today's purposes, the

459
00:25:37 --> 00:25:40
fundamental question.
 

460
00:25:40 --> 00:25:43
But understand that that's my
invented jargon and I won't put

461
00:25:43 --> 00:25:47
a question on the exam saying,
what's the fundamental

462
00:25:47 --> 00:25:49
question?
 

463
00:25:49 --> 00:25:52
The question here is, who is
this-- I keep talking about

464
00:25:52 --> 00:25:55
you-- you know, you can be
pushed around by these laws

465
00:25:55 --> 00:25:56
of social impact and
stuff like that.

466
00:25:56 --> 00:26:06
Who is this you, or I that can
be so readily manipulated?

467
00:26:06 --> 00:26:11
There's a lot of folk
psychology about it.

468
00:26:11 --> 00:26:13
 
 

469
00:26:13 --> 00:26:19
Well, look, we understand for
instance, it is possible to

470
00:26:19 --> 00:26:26
control a car in such a way
that the car kills somebody.

471
00:26:26 --> 00:26:31
It is also possible to train a
dog in such a way that the dog

472
00:26:31 --> 00:26:35
kills somebody, and history
tells us, it is possible to

473
00:26:35 --> 00:26:41
train human beings in such
a way that a human being

474
00:26:41 --> 00:26:42
kills another human being.
 

475
00:26:42 --> 00:26:45
There's something fundamentally
different, folk psychology

476
00:26:45 --> 00:26:47
understands that there's
something fundamentally

477
00:26:47 --> 00:26:52
different about the
responsibility involved here on

478
00:26:52 --> 00:26:58
the part of the car, the
dog, and the human.

479
00:26:58 --> 00:27:03
And that seems to have to do
with this sense of self.

480
00:27:03 --> 00:27:07
The sense of you as a
self-aware, psychologically

481
00:27:07 --> 00:27:10
continuous overtime
kind of entity.

482
00:27:10 --> 00:27:15
Is there anything useful
that we can say about that?

483
00:27:15 --> 00:27:22
About that sense of you
as a psychological self?

484
00:27:22 --> 00:27:24
All right, let's back
into this a little bit.

485
00:27:24 --> 00:27:29
If you look at me, you
know who I am, right?

486
00:27:29 --> 00:27:31
Pretty much, those of you
who don't, it's getting a

487
00:27:31 --> 00:27:33
little late in the term.
 

488
00:27:33 --> 00:27:35
But you know, you recognize me.
 

489
00:27:35 --> 00:27:35
That's fine.
 

490
00:27:35 --> 00:27:40
Could I be a cunningly
disguised actor who's

491
00:27:40 --> 00:27:43
impersonating Wolfe today?
 

492
00:27:43 --> 00:27:45
Yeah, that's possible.
 

493
00:27:45 --> 00:27:46
Be mildly interesting.
 

494
00:27:46 --> 00:27:48
OK fine.
 

495
00:27:48 --> 00:27:49
Switch.
 

496
00:27:49 --> 00:27:53
All right, let's suppose this
is your mother or somebody else

497
00:27:53 --> 00:27:57
who you feel strongly about.
 

498
00:27:57 --> 00:27:59
You look at that person
and the recognition

499
00:27:59 --> 00:28:02
has two pieces to it.
 

500
00:28:02 --> 00:28:07
More than presumably looking
at just some person you know.

501
00:28:07 --> 00:28:12
There's a fairly strong
affective component.

502
00:28:12 --> 00:28:14
Let's take the best
case scenario here.

503
00:28:14 --> 00:28:17
You see your mother you
recognize, that's my mother

504
00:28:17 --> 00:28:18
and I love my mother.
 

505
00:28:18 --> 00:28:20
OK, good.
 

506
00:28:20 --> 00:28:26
Let's suppose that something
goes wrong with the

507
00:28:26 --> 00:28:28
affect piece of that.
 

508
00:28:28 --> 00:28:30
You know, there's some
hunk of brain that's

509
00:28:30 --> 00:28:30
doing that for you.
 

510
00:28:30 --> 00:28:33
Something goes wrong with that
little hunk of brain and you

511
00:28:33 --> 00:28:37
look at your mother and
you say, I recognize my

512
00:28:37 --> 00:28:41
mother and I hate that.
 

513
00:28:41 --> 00:28:44
Or I don't feel anything would
be another possibility.

514
00:28:44 --> 00:28:48
That doesn't make sense.
 

515
00:28:48 --> 00:28:50
This again, happening-- you're
not sitting there with a little

516
00:28:50 --> 00:28:52
checklist saying, does
this makes sense?

517
00:28:52 --> 00:28:56
You're toting up your current
experience and asking

518
00:28:56 --> 00:28:58
implicitly, does
this make sense?

519
00:28:58 --> 00:28:59
The answer is no.
 

520
00:28:59 --> 00:29:00
How could that be?
 

521
00:29:00 --> 00:29:04
Well, one possibility-- it
sounds a little odd-- but

522
00:29:04 --> 00:29:08
one possibility is that's
not really my mother.

523
00:29:08 --> 00:29:12
It looks like my mother, but
actually she's been cunningly

524
00:29:12 --> 00:29:17
replaced by a fake.
 

525
00:29:17 --> 00:29:18
Why would that be?
 

526
00:29:18 --> 00:29:21
Well, you know, if it was my
real mother, I love my mother.

527
00:29:21 --> 00:29:24
I don't love this,
therefore it's a fake.

528
00:29:24 --> 00:29:27
Now that sounds weird, but it's
a real neurological condition.

529
00:29:27 --> 00:29:28
It's called Capgras syndrome.
 

530
00:29:28 --> 00:29:32
I put a definition of it,
I think, on the handout.

531
00:29:32 --> 00:29:40
 
 

532
00:29:40 --> 00:29:43
I always think of it as crab
grass syndrome, but the

533
00:29:43 --> 00:29:49
Capgras is correct and
it's the name of somebody.

534
00:29:49 --> 00:29:55
The disorder seems to be
an effort to reconcile

535
00:29:55 --> 00:30:00
an unreconcilable
pair of thoughts.

536
00:30:00 --> 00:30:04
 
 

537
00:30:04 --> 00:30:08
It sometimes travels with
schizophrenia as a diagnosis.

538
00:30:08 --> 00:30:12
It may be the result
of a brain injury.

539
00:30:12 --> 00:30:14
Typically, when there's a brain
injury involved it looks like

540
00:30:14 --> 00:30:16
it's frontal lobe
in some fashion.

541
00:30:16 --> 00:30:21
 
 

542
00:30:21 --> 00:30:24
It's relevant to the current
discussion because you can

543
00:30:24 --> 00:30:28
have the same phenomenon
for yourself.

544
00:30:28 --> 00:30:32
You look in the mirror,
you say, that's not me.

545
00:30:32 --> 00:30:40
And you have a denial
that you are you.

546
00:30:40 --> 00:30:47
It points out that even
something as self- evident as--

547
00:30:47 --> 00:30:52
is it a Dr. Seuss book-- I
am I, where's that from?

548
00:30:52 --> 00:30:54
I can almost hear it.
 

549
00:30:54 --> 00:30:57
You haven't been reading your
kid lit recently enough.

550
00:30:57 --> 00:30:59
AUDIENCE: Sam I Am.
 

551
00:30:59 --> 00:31:01
PROFESSOR: No, Sam I Am,
but I don't think Sam

552
00:31:01 --> 00:31:05
has Capgras issues.
 

553
00:31:05 --> 00:31:08
I am I, and I can't
remember what comes next.

554
00:31:08 --> 00:31:09
Oh well, doesn't matter.
 

555
00:31:09 --> 00:31:13
In any case, one might ask
whether there is some little

556
00:31:13 --> 00:31:19
piece of neural tissue
that is you in this sense.

557
00:31:19 --> 00:31:22
That if we were to go in and
take out this one little bit

558
00:31:22 --> 00:31:25
of tissue that what we would
discover is that you

559
00:31:25 --> 00:31:26
weren't you anymore.
 

560
00:31:26 --> 00:31:29
That you'd be-- yeah, you'd
still have a memory, you'd

561
00:31:29 --> 00:31:30
still have this, you'd still
have that, but you just

562
00:31:30 --> 00:31:35
wouldn't have this
sense of being you.

563
00:31:35 --> 00:31:37
The short answer to that is
there doesn't seem to be any

564
00:31:37 --> 00:31:40
specific lesion that does that.
 

565
00:31:40 --> 00:31:42
That used to be sort of the end
of this part of the lecture.

566
00:31:42 --> 00:31:47
However, particularly with the
advent of fMRI it's becoming

567
00:31:47 --> 00:31:54
increasingly clear that aspects
of this sense of the self do

568
00:31:54 --> 00:31:58
have homes in the brain that
can be localized to some

569
00:31:58 --> 00:32:05
extent, damaged in various odd
neurological disorders, and

570
00:32:05 --> 00:32:09
give us some idea about how it
is that this sense of

571
00:32:09 --> 00:32:11
self is assembled.
 

572
00:32:11 --> 00:32:15
So what I've done is I've
actually modified a list from a

573
00:32:15 --> 00:32:19
recent article in Trends in
Cognitive Science to come up

574
00:32:19 --> 00:32:22
with six aspects of the self.
 

575
00:32:22 --> 00:32:24
To give you some notion about
how you could take this problem

576
00:32:24 --> 00:32:31
apart the first of these-- I
must have just listed them

577
00:32:31 --> 00:32:32
on the handout, right?
 

578
00:32:32 --> 00:32:35
The first of these
is representation.

579
00:32:35 --> 00:32:39
 
 

580
00:32:39 --> 00:32:42
Nobody, when asked about
themselves, what kind

581
00:32:42 --> 00:32:45
of person are you?
 

582
00:32:45 --> 00:32:50
Nobody says, Oh, I am just
a collection of reflexes

583
00:32:50 --> 00:32:53
responding to the current
situation in the environment.

584
00:32:53 --> 00:32:56
Everybody has a list of
you know, I'm an honest,

585
00:32:56 --> 00:32:57
loving individual.
 

586
00:32:57 --> 00:33:02
You may have some sort of trait
or situational theory about how

587
00:33:02 --> 00:33:03
you came to be honest and
loving and all that, but you've

588
00:33:03 --> 00:33:07
got a set of traits that you
believe to be fundamental

589
00:33:07 --> 00:33:10
to you, at least at
the present time.

590
00:33:10 --> 00:33:13
And that's your
representation of yourself.

591
00:33:13 --> 00:33:19
That's your theory of you.
 

592
00:33:19 --> 00:33:23
You also, as part of that
theory you have this

593
00:33:23 --> 00:33:24
notion of agency.
 

594
00:33:24 --> 00:33:30
That you are responsible and
in fact, you are the cause

595
00:33:30 --> 00:33:34
of at least a reasonable
number of your actions.

596
00:33:34 --> 00:33:39
You feel that you
own those actions.

597
00:33:39 --> 00:33:44
That's part of what makes the
Milgram experiment disturbing.

598
00:33:44 --> 00:33:50
It's not disturbing that a
machine can produce 450 volt

599
00:33:50 --> 00:33:52
shocks of some schnook.
 

600
00:33:52 --> 00:33:56
It's disturbing that you can
because you figured that you

601
00:33:56 --> 00:34:01
own that action and that if
you did it that says

602
00:34:01 --> 00:34:03
something about you.
 

603
00:34:03 --> 00:34:07
That's this question of agency.
 

604
00:34:07 --> 00:34:13
Now not only do you own
actions, you own your body.

605
00:34:13 --> 00:34:15
That's the aspect of ownership
that I'm talking about

606
00:34:15 --> 00:34:18
in number 3 there.
 

607
00:34:18 --> 00:34:19
You own your body.
 

608
00:34:19 --> 00:34:22
Look, you also own your laptop.
 

609
00:34:22 --> 00:34:28
But you own your body in ways
that are more profound than the

610
00:34:28 --> 00:34:30
way that you own your laptop.
 

611
00:34:30 --> 00:34:34
There's something fundamentally
different about that.

612
00:34:34 --> 00:34:39
You're able to use this
information that you've got

613
00:34:39 --> 00:34:42
about what kind of you you are.
 

614
00:34:42 --> 00:34:47
You're able to use that to
perform new calculations,

615
00:34:47 --> 00:34:47
if you like.
 

616
00:34:47 --> 00:34:54
Like, do I like-- I don't
know-- I need a new fruit.

617
00:34:54 --> 00:34:55
Durian.
 

618
00:34:55 --> 00:34:57
Do I like durian?
 

619
00:34:57 --> 00:34:59
Well, it's a fruit.
 

620
00:34:59 --> 00:35:00
I like fruits.
 

621
00:35:00 --> 00:35:03
It's supposed to smell
like fermented garlic.

622
00:35:03 --> 00:35:04
Sounds [UNINTELLIGIBLE].
 

623
00:35:04 --> 00:35:11
I can ask myself questions
about my self based on

624
00:35:11 --> 00:35:12
my knowledge of myself.
 

625
00:35:12 --> 00:35:15
That's this evaluation aspect.
 

626
00:35:15 --> 00:35:19
Monitoring is sort of a sub--
well, I don't know if I would

627
00:35:19 --> 00:35:20
consider it to be
a subset of that.

628
00:35:20 --> 00:35:26
Monitoring is keeping track of
what you are doing and asking

629
00:35:26 --> 00:35:29
yourself how it's going.
 

630
00:35:29 --> 00:35:33
All right, so I'm self-
monitoring here saying,

631
00:35:33 --> 00:35:35
am I really going
to fall over today?

632
00:35:35 --> 00:35:36
No, I don't think so.
 

633
00:35:36 --> 00:35:38
I'm feeling pretty good
just at the moment.

634
00:35:38 --> 00:35:40
That's monitoring.
 

635
00:35:40 --> 00:35:43
You're asking yourself,
am I still awake?

636
00:35:43 --> 00:35:45
If you're answering yes, the
answer is probably yes.

637
00:35:45 --> 00:35:50
If you answer no,
that's a little weird.

638
00:35:50 --> 00:35:52
Or it's lucid dreaming
or something.

639
00:35:52 --> 00:35:55
That's nice, too.
 

640
00:35:55 --> 00:35:58
And finally there's this sense
of integration where the whole

641
00:35:58 --> 00:36:02
thing is tied together
into a single self.

642
00:36:02 --> 00:36:06
There's been plenty of evidence
that we've been accumulating

643
00:36:06 --> 00:36:08
during the course of the term
that you are in some

644
00:36:08 --> 00:36:10
sense a committee.
 

645
00:36:10 --> 00:36:13
That you've got lots of
semi-autonomous bits and pieces

646
00:36:13 --> 00:36:17
doing their thing and giving
rise to you, but an important

647
00:36:17 --> 00:36:21
sense of you is that it
doesn't feel that way to you.

648
00:36:21 --> 00:36:26
You don't think of yourself as
a committee or a collective or

649
00:36:26 --> 00:36:30
what's that thing-- is Star
Wars where the colonial

650
00:36:30 --> 00:36:34
organism-- is that the Borg?
 

651
00:36:34 --> 00:36:35
The Borg, right?
 

652
00:36:35 --> 00:36:36
You don't think
you're the Borg.

653
00:36:36 --> 00:36:39
 
 

654
00:36:39 --> 00:36:46
You've got this sense that
you are a unitary thing.

655
00:36:46 --> 00:36:50
Now each of these bits, while
it's not the case that we can

656
00:36:50 --> 00:36:54
go in and somehow pull out the
thing that is you, at least

657
00:36:54 --> 00:36:58
nobody's figured out what
piece of brain that might be.

658
00:36:58 --> 00:37:07
Each of these aspects of you is
subject to attack and to some

659
00:37:07 --> 00:37:12
degree at this point of
localization in the brain.

660
00:37:12 --> 00:37:16
A clear example would be
the question of ownership.

661
00:37:16 --> 00:37:19
I think I actually talked about
some of this earlier when we

662
00:37:19 --> 00:37:20
were talking about perception.
 

663
00:37:20 --> 00:37:25
If you get a lesion in your
right parietal lobe you will

664
00:37:25 --> 00:37:27
typically show symptoms
of what's known as

665
00:37:27 --> 00:37:29
contralateral neglect.
 

666
00:37:29 --> 00:37:33
Contralateral meaning on the
other side and what I think I

667
00:37:33 --> 00:37:36
talked about when I was talking
about perception is the fact

668
00:37:36 --> 00:37:40
that you will ignore the left
side of visual space and I

669
00:37:40 --> 00:37:42
think at that point I also
mentioned that people ignore

670
00:37:42 --> 00:37:45
the left side of their body.
 

671
00:37:45 --> 00:37:47
You can have all sorts of
varieties of neglect, but it

672
00:37:47 --> 00:37:51
can include ignoring the left
side of your body to the point

673
00:37:51 --> 00:37:54
of denying-- I mean, you can
see it, but you might

674
00:37:54 --> 00:37:57
deny that it's you.
 

675
00:37:57 --> 00:37:58
That's neglect.
 

676
00:37:58 --> 00:38:02
Interestingly, if you lesion
the left parietal lobe you do

677
00:38:02 --> 00:38:08
not typically get neglect of
the right side of the body.

678
00:38:08 --> 00:38:10
At least not in
right-handed individuals.

679
00:38:10 --> 00:38:14
The best understanding I've
ever come up with for that is

680
00:38:14 --> 00:38:17
that it may be that in
right-handed individuals the

681
00:38:17 --> 00:38:20
right side of the body is
represented more robustly or

682
00:38:20 --> 00:38:24
redundantly than the left side
of the body and so a typical

683
00:38:24 --> 00:38:28
lesion that leaves you alive,
at least, doesn't take out the

684
00:38:28 --> 00:38:32
entire sense that you own
that side of the body.

685
00:38:32 --> 00:38:38
Whereas, a lesion of the less
dominant, right hemisphere,

686
00:38:38 --> 00:38:41
left side of the body takes out
this sense-- leaves you with

687
00:38:41 --> 00:38:44
the sense that you don't
own the left side of

688
00:38:44 --> 00:38:45
your body at all.
 

689
00:38:45 --> 00:38:51
Now the flip side of this is
our phantom limb phenomena.

690
00:38:51 --> 00:38:56
So suppose you lose the limb
rather than the piece of brain

691
00:38:56 --> 00:38:58
that represents the limb.
 

692
00:38:58 --> 00:39:05
So if you lose a limb very
typically-- well, the hunk

693
00:39:05 --> 00:39:07
of brain is still there.
 

694
00:39:07 --> 00:39:09
And the brain is a kind
of a noisy place.

695
00:39:09 --> 00:39:13
What's going to happen if
you've got activity that goes

696
00:39:13 --> 00:39:17
above some sort of threshold
in the chunk of brain that

697
00:39:17 --> 00:39:19
used to represent this arm?
 

698
00:39:19 --> 00:39:24
The answer is, you're going to
think you've still got an arm.

699
00:39:24 --> 00:39:27
And you may know at some nice
cognitive or depressing

700
00:39:27 --> 00:39:30
cognitive level that you don't
have that arm anymore, but it's

701
00:39:30 --> 00:39:33
going to feel like it's there.
 

702
00:39:33 --> 00:39:37
And it can be really annoying.
 

703
00:39:37 --> 00:39:39
Because phantom limbs do
things like they get

704
00:39:39 --> 00:39:43
stuck in a position.
 

705
00:39:43 --> 00:39:44
Why's that annoying?
 

706
00:39:44 --> 00:39:47
Well, that's annoying because
somebody with a phantom limb

707
00:39:47 --> 00:39:55
stuck like this walking out the
door does things like this.

708
00:39:55 --> 00:39:57
Which is exactly what you would
do of course if your arm was

709
00:39:57 --> 00:39:59
like in a sling out there
because you don't want

710
00:39:59 --> 00:40:02
to bash into the door.
 

711
00:40:02 --> 00:40:06
But you know, you feel a bit of
a fool if you're doing that

712
00:40:06 --> 00:40:10
with a limb that you know
perfectly well isn't there.

713
00:40:10 --> 00:40:15
What do you do if you've got
an itch in your phantom limb?

714
00:40:15 --> 00:40:19
Or actually pain in phantom
limbs is an even more

715
00:40:19 --> 00:40:20
serious problem.
 

716
00:40:20 --> 00:40:22
Perfectly possible to have
pain in your phantom limb.

717
00:40:22 --> 00:40:27
 
 

718
00:40:27 --> 00:40:30
It's not particularly
easy to treat that.

719
00:40:30 --> 00:40:37
Now it turns that the brain,
the brain, like nature,

720
00:40:37 --> 00:40:39
abhors a vacuum.
 

721
00:40:39 --> 00:40:45
And if you lose a limb the
chunks of the brain surrounding

722
00:40:45 --> 00:40:50
the arm representation start to
say, there's open

723
00:40:50 --> 00:40:52
territory here.
 

724
00:40:52 --> 00:40:54
We could take that.
 

725
00:40:54 --> 00:41:00
And over time the brain
reorganizes and you get

726
00:41:00 --> 00:41:03
very curious reports
about the limb changing.

727
00:41:03 --> 00:41:06
So the limb may shrivel up.
 

728
00:41:06 --> 00:41:10
There are reports where the
guy comes back to the doctor

729
00:41:10 --> 00:41:11
and says, how you doing?
 

730
00:41:11 --> 00:41:12
I'm doing much better.
 

731
00:41:12 --> 00:41:16
Now instead of this stupid limb
out here I just have fingers

732
00:41:16 --> 00:41:18
hanging off my shoulder.
 

733
00:41:18 --> 00:41:21
Which it's kind of weird,
but since they're invisible

734
00:41:21 --> 00:41:22
it's not that weird.
 

735
00:41:22 --> 00:41:26
 
 

736
00:41:26 --> 00:41:30
What seems to happen is that
neighboring stuff takes over

737
00:41:30 --> 00:41:37
what's near to the arm and
the hand in the sensory

738
00:41:37 --> 00:41:41
homunculus, for example,
are things like the face.

739
00:41:41 --> 00:41:46
And I put a reference to
Ramachandran's entertaining, as

740
00:41:46 --> 00:41:51
I said, a book on the handout.
 

741
00:41:51 --> 00:41:57
Blakesley is a science writer,
Ramachandran or Rama as he is

742
00:41:57 --> 00:42:00
usually called is-- well, I
think of him as a vision

743
00:42:00 --> 00:42:02
researcher though, mostly these
days he's gone off more into

744
00:42:02 --> 00:42:05
the sort of neurological work.
 

745
00:42:05 --> 00:42:13
But what he did was he was
testing phantom limb patients.

746
00:42:13 --> 00:42:18
He would touch them on their
face and ask, what do you feel?

747
00:42:18 --> 00:42:21
And the patient-- he's got
interesting video actually of

748
00:42:21 --> 00:42:23
the patient saying, well, look
of course, I can feel you

749
00:42:23 --> 00:42:26
touching my face, but the
interesting thing is it also

750
00:42:26 --> 00:42:29
feels like you're touching
my phantom thumb.

751
00:42:29 --> 00:42:31
You move over a little bit and
now it feels like you're

752
00:42:31 --> 00:42:36
touching this phantom
finger and so on.

753
00:42:36 --> 00:42:43
And you could actually map out
for hand and arm across the

754
00:42:43 --> 00:42:46
surface of this guy's face.
 

755
00:42:46 --> 00:42:47
He loved it, by the way.
 

756
00:42:47 --> 00:42:51
Why did he think this was good?
 

757
00:42:51 --> 00:42:51
Yeah?
 

758
00:42:51 --> 00:42:52
AUDIENCE: He could itch it?
 

759
00:42:52 --> 00:42:54
PROFESSOR: Yeah, he knew where
to scratch if it itched.

760
00:42:54 --> 00:42:55
And it worked.
 

761
00:42:55 --> 00:42:58
You get an itch on your phantom
arm, he's now learned that he

762
00:42:58 --> 00:43:05
can scratch there and you
get a degree of relief.

763
00:43:05 --> 00:43:09
 
 

764
00:43:09 --> 00:43:16
So the sense of ownership of
the body can be localized in

765
00:43:16 --> 00:43:22
the brain to the things like
these parietal structures.

766
00:43:22 --> 00:43:27
The degree to which the brain
is plastic even in adulthood is

767
00:43:27 --> 00:43:32
a growing story where you find
that the chunks of-- oh there

768
00:43:32 --> 00:43:35
was an fMRI study showing for
instance, that if you look at

769
00:43:35 --> 00:43:40
violinists, the representation
of the fingering hand in the

770
00:43:40 --> 00:43:42
brain is larger than the
representation of

771
00:43:42 --> 00:43:44
the bowing hand.
 

772
00:43:44 --> 00:43:46
The fingering hand is learning
a whole lot of stuff that the

773
00:43:46 --> 00:43:49
bowing hand doesn't need to and
it ends up using more

774
00:43:49 --> 00:43:51
brain, apparently.
 

775
00:43:51 --> 00:43:55
All right, lets go back to this
notion of the self as a bundle

776
00:43:55 --> 00:43:58
of personality attributes.
 

777
00:43:58 --> 00:44:01
And of your understanding
of the implications

778
00:44:01 --> 00:44:02
of that knowledge.
 

779
00:44:02 --> 00:44:04
So these are the ideas of
representation and evaluation

780
00:44:04 --> 00:44:07
from that earlier list.
 

781
00:44:07 --> 00:44:11
Does this have a home?
 

782
00:44:11 --> 00:44:14
Maybe is a reasonable answer.
 

783
00:44:14 --> 00:44:20
There is evidence from
neuropathology that suggests

784
00:44:20 --> 00:44:25
disorders that specifically
attack that aspect of the self.

785
00:44:25 --> 00:44:29
The disorder I'm thinking of
is known as Pick's disease,

786
00:44:29 --> 00:44:32
which I probably labeled
on the handout as a

787
00:44:32 --> 00:44:35
fronto-temporal dementia.
 

788
00:44:35 --> 00:44:37
Oh, it says that on
the handout also.

789
00:44:37 --> 00:44:39
The way to think about it is
sort of like an Alzheimer's

790
00:44:39 --> 00:44:40
of the personality.
 

791
00:44:40 --> 00:44:43
It's an Alzheimer's like
disorder, it's a terrible

792
00:44:43 --> 00:44:49
diagnosis by the way because
it typically is a very

793
00:44:49 --> 00:44:54
progressive-- quite rapidly
progressive dementia that

794
00:44:54 --> 00:44:58
leaves you witless fairly
quickly and dead fairly

795
00:44:58 --> 00:45:00
shortly thereafter.
 

796
00:45:00 --> 00:45:01
Very bad news.
 

797
00:45:01 --> 00:45:06
But it is of psychological
interest because while the

798
00:45:06 --> 00:45:08
initial manifestations of
Alzheimer's are often this

799
00:45:08 --> 00:45:12
sort of forgetfulness, the
manifestations-- what gets your

800
00:45:12 --> 00:45:16
family to bring you to the
doctor if you've got Pick's

801
00:45:16 --> 00:45:19
is a change in personality.
 

802
00:45:19 --> 00:45:21
I'll tell you a couple
of anecdotes here.

803
00:45:21 --> 00:45:24
Here's a patient, 54 year-old
woman described as a charming,

804
00:45:24 --> 00:45:28
dynamic real estate agent who
goes from wearing expensive

805
00:45:28 --> 00:45:31
designer apparel to choosing
cheap clothing and gaudy beads

806
00:45:31 --> 00:45:34
and asking strangers how
much their clothes cost.

807
00:45:34 --> 00:45:38
Once a lover of French cuisine,
she adopted a love of fast

808
00:45:38 --> 00:45:40
food, particularly, Taco Bell.
 

809
00:45:40 --> 00:45:43
Now look, if you like Taco Bell
that doesn't mean you're going

810
00:45:43 --> 00:45:46
to die of dementia next week.
 

811
00:45:46 --> 00:45:51
The point is that what people
notice, what your family

812
00:45:51 --> 00:45:55
typically notices is an
unexplained change in that

813
00:45:55 --> 00:46:00
sort of list of attributes
that makes you you.

814
00:46:00 --> 00:46:05
Or a patient, 63 year-old woman
described as a well- dressed--

815
00:46:05 --> 00:46:07
I don't know why they're all
well- dressed-- well- dressed,

816
00:46:07 --> 00:46:10
lifelong political conservative
who became an animal rights

817
00:46:10 --> 00:46:12
activist who hated
conservatives, dressed in

818
00:46:12 --> 00:46:15
T-shirts and baggy pants and
liked to say Republicans should

819
00:46:15 --> 00:46:19
be taken off the earth.
 

820
00:46:19 --> 00:46:24
So again, you can imagine
somebody whose political

821
00:46:24 --> 00:46:30
opinions evolve, but you could
also imagine that if your rock-

822
00:46:30 --> 00:46:36
ribbed Republican grandma was
suddenly doing a kind of a

823
00:46:36 --> 00:46:40
late hippie thing and
people might worry.

824
00:46:40 --> 00:46:43
 
 

825
00:46:43 --> 00:46:47
The lesions here seem to be
typically at this stage in the

826
00:46:47 --> 00:46:56
right frontal lobe when you get
these people into a scanner.

827
00:46:56 --> 00:47:08
 
 

828
00:47:08 --> 00:47:09
That was a mistake.
 

829
00:47:09 --> 00:47:11
Shouldn't try lecturing
while you're drinking.

830
00:47:11 --> 00:47:15
 
 

831
00:47:15 --> 00:47:16
But no, you don't
have to rescue me.

832
00:47:16 --> 00:47:19
 
 

833
00:47:19 --> 00:47:23
I think I'll be able
to rescue myself.

834
00:47:23 --> 00:47:28
Anyway, so the loci that seem
to be particularly important,

835
00:47:28 --> 00:47:31
but if I've been eating you
should come up and

836
00:47:31 --> 00:47:34
then Heimlich me and
stuff like that.

837
00:47:34 --> 00:47:37
I don't think the Heimlich
maneuver works well for water.

838
00:47:37 --> 00:47:42
Anyway, the particular chunks
of brain that seem, at least

839
00:47:42 --> 00:47:47
one recent study suggests are
important here, are chunks of

840
00:47:47 --> 00:47:50
the frontal lobe lying on
the midline, so your

841
00:47:50 --> 00:47:51
brain's like this.
 

842
00:47:51 --> 00:47:57
If you open it up that's
the medial surface of the

843
00:47:57 --> 00:48:00
cerebral hemispheres.
 

844
00:48:00 --> 00:48:05
And there's evidence that
locations sort of in there

845
00:48:05 --> 00:48:07
are what's important.
 

846
00:48:07 --> 00:48:10
What may be very important
for putting together

847
00:48:10 --> 00:48:12
this sense of the self.
 

848
00:48:12 --> 00:48:18
I think I did-- oh yes, I put
on the handout the notion that

849
00:48:18 --> 00:48:21
orbital medial prefrontal
cortex might be a possible

850
00:48:21 --> 00:48:22
home for representation.
 

851
00:48:22 --> 00:48:26
I put that there just because
it's got to be so much fun to

852
00:48:26 --> 00:48:30
go off and be able to talk
about the OMPFC and to

853
00:48:30 --> 00:48:33
distinguish it from the DMPFC.
 

854
00:48:33 --> 00:48:37
I promise not to ask exactly
that-- is representation

855
00:48:37 --> 00:48:42
localized in the
OMPFC or DMPFC?

856
00:48:42 --> 00:48:46
This is for the subset of you
who are dying to go off to med

857
00:48:46 --> 00:48:50
school and stuff like that and
want practice using jargon that

858
00:48:50 --> 00:48:51
nobody else will understand.
 

859
00:48:51 --> 00:48:54
 
 

860
00:48:54 --> 00:48:55
Don't get me wrong,
this is useful stuff.

861
00:48:55 --> 00:48:58
If you're interested in the
topic the reference on the

862
00:48:58 --> 00:49:02
handout to-- did I put the
reference on the handout?

863
00:49:02 --> 00:49:07
Yes, this comes from this
Northoff and Bermpohl article

864
00:49:07 --> 00:49:09
way up at the top of page 2.
 

865
00:49:09 --> 00:49:11
By all means, go check it out.
 

866
00:49:11 --> 00:49:14
I just realized when I was
thinking about lecturing about

867
00:49:14 --> 00:49:17
this that I knew that a whole
bunch of people are going to go

868
00:49:17 --> 00:49:21
get deeply obsessive about
worrying about whether they've

869
00:49:21 --> 00:49:24
got the OM versus the DM
straight and I don't want

870
00:49:24 --> 00:49:26
people to spend a lot of
time worrying about that.

871
00:49:26 --> 00:49:29
What I want you to come away
with is the notion that there

872
00:49:29 --> 00:49:33
are a set of localizable bits
of particularly frontal

873
00:49:33 --> 00:49:40
structures in the brain where
you can make a case for each

874
00:49:40 --> 00:49:45
little bit being responsible
for a little bit of this

875
00:49:45 --> 00:49:52
overall sense of the self.
 

876
00:49:52 --> 00:49:58
Well, one of the ones actually
where the little chunk of

877
00:49:58 --> 00:50:00
brain-- again, I probably won't
ask a question, but where

878
00:50:00 --> 00:50:03
little chunk of brain is quite
clearly doing something

879
00:50:03 --> 00:50:06
specific for you is the
anterior cingulate.

880
00:50:06 --> 00:50:11
Again, and the midline of the
brain or the medial surface of

881
00:50:11 --> 00:50:16
the cerebral hemispheres are
wrapped around the corpus

882
00:50:16 --> 00:50:18
callosum, that big bundle of
fibers that connects the

883
00:50:18 --> 00:50:19
two halves of the brain.
 

884
00:50:19 --> 00:50:23
The cool thing about that is
that it really looks like it's

885
00:50:23 --> 00:50:26
serving a monitoring role.
 

886
00:50:26 --> 00:50:29
What it does is it's the thing
that's siting there checking,

887
00:50:29 --> 00:50:31
am I making a mistake here?
 

888
00:50:31 --> 00:50:34
 
 

889
00:50:34 --> 00:50:40
If you're in our lab I can feel
my anterior cingulate light up

890
00:50:40 --> 00:50:43
because if you're in the lab
and you're doing a whole bunch

891
00:50:43 --> 00:50:48
of visual search experiments
and you hit the no key just as

892
00:50:48 --> 00:50:54
you see the target-- that
"Oh dear" phenomenon.

893
00:50:54 --> 00:50:56
Where you can just feel
yourself saying a word you

894
00:50:56 --> 00:50:59
shouldn't say, that's your
anterior cingulate

895
00:50:59 --> 00:51:01
error monitoring.
 

896
00:51:01 --> 00:51:01
How do we know that?
 

897
00:51:01 --> 00:51:04
Because if you do these
experiments in a scanner

898
00:51:04 --> 00:51:07
when people make
errors that lights up.

899
00:51:07 --> 00:51:10
It's really quite lovely.
 

900
00:51:10 --> 00:51:18
It's also, in the practical
advice side of the course, it

901
00:51:18 --> 00:51:21
turns out at least from a
couple of things that I

902
00:51:21 --> 00:51:25
read that the anterior
cingulate is particularly

903
00:51:25 --> 00:51:28
vulnerable to alcohol.
 

904
00:51:28 --> 00:51:29
What's that mean?
 

905
00:51:29 --> 00:51:33
Well, it means have a few
drinks and the chunk of your

906
00:51:33 --> 00:51:40
brain that's saying, "Is this
a mistake?" takes a vacation.

907
00:51:40 --> 00:51:44
So have a few drinks, go down
to Kenmore Square to celebrate

908
00:51:44 --> 00:51:47
the Red Sox-- look,
there's a car.

909
00:51:47 --> 00:51:50
Could we flip that over?
 

910
00:51:50 --> 00:51:51
Yeah, we could do that.
 

911
00:51:51 --> 00:51:53
Would that be a mistake?
 

912
00:51:53 --> 00:51:58
I don't know, the guys asleep
so don't wake him up.

913
00:51:58 --> 00:52:01
Or you know, go and drink
a few things and should I

914
00:52:01 --> 00:52:04
sleep with that person?
 

915
00:52:04 --> 00:52:08
I don't know, we'll
ask in the morning.

916
00:52:08 --> 00:52:11
Well, I guess the answer
was no, I shouldn't have.

917
00:52:11 --> 00:52:19
But anyways, next time you are
inclined to imbibe something

918
00:52:19 --> 00:52:23
stronger than Poland Spring
Water just think of your little

919
00:52:23 --> 00:52:32
anterior cingulate that's
bathing in alcohol and then you

920
00:52:32 --> 00:52:36
can go drive down the highway
and say, "Would it be a mistake

921
00:52:36 --> 00:52:40
to pass this semi on
a wet road tonight?

922
00:52:40 --> 00:52:44
Well, I don't know, let's find
out." So you want to keep that

923
00:52:44 --> 00:52:45
piece of your brain and you
want to keep it more

924
00:52:45 --> 00:52:46
or less functional.
 

925
00:52:46 --> 00:52:50
 
 

926
00:52:50 --> 00:52:56
The conscious you, this
notion of integration

927
00:52:56 --> 00:53:00
seems to have something
to do with the notion.

928
00:53:00 --> 00:53:02
What's it mean that
it's all one thing?

929
00:53:02 --> 00:53:06
In some way this is all tied
into the fact that you feel

930
00:53:06 --> 00:53:15
like a single, self-reflective,
conscious entity.

931
00:53:15 --> 00:53:19
Well, one interesting question
is, are you conscious?

932
00:53:19 --> 00:53:20
Well, sure.
 

933
00:53:20 --> 00:53:23
Now that I asked you.
 

934
00:53:23 --> 00:53:27
Were you conscious
before I asked you?

935
00:53:27 --> 00:53:30
Oh maybe.
 

936
00:53:30 --> 00:53:33
This is what's known in the
philosophical literature as the

937
00:53:33 --> 00:53:36
refrigerator light problem.
 

938
00:53:36 --> 00:53:38
Is the refrigerator
light on when the

939
00:53:38 --> 00:53:40
refrigerator is closed?
 

940
00:53:40 --> 00:53:41
AUDIENCE: No.
 

941
00:53:41 --> 00:53:45
PROFESSOR: Well you know that
the answer is really no

942
00:53:45 --> 00:53:49
and look-- even most
philosophers know that.

943
00:53:49 --> 00:53:55
But that's because you have
some sort of a deeper

944
00:53:55 --> 00:53:59
understanding of refrigerators.
 

945
00:53:59 --> 00:54:01
But if you're just faced with
this thing and the question

946
00:54:01 --> 00:54:04
is, is the light on when
the door is closed?

947
00:54:04 --> 00:54:05
How would you know?
 

948
00:54:05 --> 00:54:07
Open the door, light's on.
 

949
00:54:07 --> 00:54:09
It's always on.
 

950
00:54:09 --> 00:54:12
Every time I open it up the
light is on, it's cool.

951
00:54:12 --> 00:54:16
 
 

952
00:54:16 --> 00:54:18
People seriously entertain
the possibility that

953
00:54:18 --> 00:54:19
consciousness is like that.
 

954
00:54:19 --> 00:54:22
It feels continuous because
every time you ask yourself in

955
00:54:22 --> 00:54:24
any fashion about whether or
not you're conscious, not

956
00:54:24 --> 00:54:28
counting the guys who were out
cold and well, they can't ask

957
00:54:28 --> 00:54:31
themselves anyway, you
feel conscious, right?

958
00:54:31 --> 00:54:35
 
 

959
00:54:35 --> 00:54:40
The closest you can get to a
sort of a feeling that there

960
00:54:40 --> 00:54:46
might be an issue here is
there's a phenomenon known to

961
00:54:46 --> 00:54:50
long haul drivers where you're
driving down the interstate,

962
00:54:50 --> 00:54:54
you get from point A to point B
and you have no recollection

963
00:54:54 --> 00:54:56
of having done that.
 

964
00:54:56 --> 00:54:57
The good thing is if you're
doing that while you're asleep.

965
00:54:57 --> 00:55:00
Asleep is a different problem.
 

966
00:55:00 --> 00:55:08
It's a very serious problem,
but the greatest number of car

967
00:55:08 --> 00:55:12
accidents per mile is not like
in downtown Boston where you

968
00:55:12 --> 00:55:13
would think it ought to be.
 

969
00:55:13 --> 00:55:19
But it's like way out West
because 600 miles, the

970
00:55:19 --> 00:55:22
road doesn't even turn.
 

971
00:55:22 --> 00:55:27
The problem is the 601 mile it
makes a 10 degrees slant off to

972
00:55:27 --> 00:55:29
one side and you're
semi doesn't.

973
00:55:29 --> 00:55:32
And you're straight into the
sage brush or something like

974
00:55:32 --> 00:55:33
that because you've
gone to sleep.

975
00:55:33 --> 00:55:36
But the less dire version of
this is you can get into a sort

976
00:55:36 --> 00:55:39
of a "nnnnn" kind of state
driving down the interstate

977
00:55:39 --> 00:55:43
where you really seem to lose a
chunk of time and you

978
00:55:43 --> 00:55:44
ask yourself, was I
conscious during that?

979
00:55:44 --> 00:55:47
I must have been awake because
I didn't crash the car,

980
00:55:47 --> 00:55:50
but there's nothing there.
 

981
00:55:50 --> 00:55:52
Whether or not you were
conscious or not I can't

982
00:55:52 --> 00:55:54
speak to because of this
refrigerator light problem.

983
00:55:54 --> 00:55:57
If we asked you while you
were in the midst of the

984
00:55:57 --> 00:55:59
state, are you conscious?
 

985
00:55:59 --> 00:56:00
You'd say, "Of course
I'm conscious.

986
00:56:00 --> 00:56:04
That's a stupid question."
 

987
00:56:04 --> 00:56:10
If you're interested, one of
the projects-- one of the more

988
00:56:10 --> 00:56:12
interesting neuroscience
projects out there is to decide

989
00:56:12 --> 00:56:15
which bits of brain are
important for consciousness.

990
00:56:15 --> 00:56:19
Christof Koch at Caltech has
done a lot of work on this,

991
00:56:19 --> 00:56:23
wrote an interesting new book,
which I would've put on the

992
00:56:23 --> 00:56:25
handout if I could have quickly
found the reference, but if you

993
00:56:25 --> 00:56:30
go to my website you can find
my one page review of the

994
00:56:30 --> 00:56:32
book-- which tells you what the
books about without you

995
00:56:32 --> 00:56:34
actually having to read it, but
it would also give you the

996
00:56:34 --> 00:56:37
reference to the book.
 

997
00:56:37 --> 00:56:40
But Christof refers to
the neural correlate

998
00:56:40 --> 00:56:41
of consciousness.
 

999
00:56:41 --> 00:56:43
The question is, which
bits of brain do you

1000
00:56:43 --> 00:56:45
need to be conscious?
 

1001
00:56:45 --> 00:56:49
And then you can go on from
there to ask, what that

1002
00:56:49 --> 00:56:52
consciousness might
actually be for?

1003
00:56:52 --> 00:56:55
It's very clear that we can
do an awful lot of stuff

1004
00:56:55 --> 00:56:58
without being conscious.
 

1005
00:56:58 --> 00:57:01
This is an important wrinkle
on this issue of agency.

1006
00:57:01 --> 00:57:03
There's an interesting body of
research that suggests that

1007
00:57:03 --> 00:57:07
when you feel like you are
making a decision-- which one

1008
00:57:07 --> 00:57:12
of these things do you want--
the brain, we can pick up a

1009
00:57:12 --> 00:57:14
lecture of physiological
indications that you have made

1010
00:57:14 --> 00:57:17
the decision before you, the
owner of the brain, know that

1011
00:57:17 --> 00:57:18
you've made the decision.
 

1012
00:57:18 --> 00:57:22
 
 

1013
00:57:22 --> 00:57:25
One can wrap oneself in
philosophical knots trying to

1014
00:57:25 --> 00:57:29
ask yourself what that means
about the agency of your acts,

1015
00:57:29 --> 00:57:33
are you-- the conscious you--
committing those acts or are

1016
00:57:33 --> 00:57:34
you merely reporting
on them afterwards?

1017
00:57:34 --> 00:57:37
But there is this interesting
data that suggests that you

1018
00:57:37 --> 00:57:39
have made the decision before
you know that you've

1019
00:57:39 --> 00:57:42
made the decision.
 

1020
00:57:42 --> 00:57:52
In any case, what we can't find
is clear evidence of a single,

1021
00:57:52 --> 00:57:56
little piece of neural
tissue that is you.

1022
00:57:56 --> 00:57:59
No single lesion seems to
leave everything else

1023
00:57:59 --> 00:58:01
intact, but take you out.
 

1024
00:58:01 --> 00:58:04
So what I want to do now is to
switch from neuropathology

1025
00:58:04 --> 00:58:05
to psychopathology.
 

1026
00:58:05 --> 00:58:08
 
 

1027
00:58:08 --> 00:58:14
But I will do that after you
take a brief stretch here

1028
00:58:14 --> 00:58:17
and then we'll talk
about that a bit.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]
 

1030
00:58:41 --> 00:58:44
AUDIENCE: I had a question
about the syndrome that you

1031
00:58:44 --> 00:58:46
talked about where you can't
recognize who you are.

1032
00:58:46 --> 00:58:50
Is it visual?
 

1033
00:58:50 --> 00:58:52
Like so if you look
in the mirror--

1034
00:58:52 --> 00:58:52
PROFESSOR: Oh, no.
 

1035
00:58:52 --> 00:58:56
You know perfectly well looking
in the mirror that that

1036
00:58:56 --> 00:58:58
looks exactly like me.
 

1037
00:58:58 --> 00:59:04
The weird thing is
it just isn't me.

1038
00:59:04 --> 00:59:08
If I had a photograph of you,
you would know that was you

1039
00:59:08 --> 00:59:10
and you would also know
that it wasn't you.

1040
00:59:10 --> 00:59:15
I mean, it's not you, you're
this person right here.

1041
00:59:15 --> 00:59:17
Now if I had a photograph of
your mother you would know that

1042
00:59:17 --> 00:59:22
this was a representation of
your mother, but wasn't

1043
00:59:22 --> 00:59:24
necessarily your
mother, per se.

1044
00:59:24 --> 00:59:27
The weird thing about Capgras
is if I had your mother here

1045
00:59:27 --> 00:59:31
you would have the same sort of
sense of it being it looks like

1046
00:59:31 --> 00:59:35
mother, but it just isn't.
 

1047
00:59:35 --> 00:59:39
It's one of those things where
it'd be cool if you could have

1048
00:59:39 --> 00:59:42
this reversibly just to
know what it felt like.

1049
00:59:42 --> 00:59:45
It'd be very hard to wrap
you brain around what

1050
00:59:45 --> 00:59:49
that particular delusion
must feel like.

1051
00:59:49 --> 00:59:52
There are visual disorders
where you don't recognize

1052
00:59:52 --> 00:59:54
faces, that's prosopagnosia.
 

1053
00:59:54 --> 00:59:55
I think I talked about earlier.
 

1054
00:59:55 --> 00:59:59
Where I look at you, I say, two
eyes, nose, mouth, it's a face.

1055
00:59:59 --> 01:00:00
Whose is it?
 

1056
01:00:00 --> 01:00:02
I don't know.
 

1057
01:00:02 --> 01:00:06
This is in some sense the
opposite, a complement of that.

1058
01:00:06 --> 01:00:09
I know exactly who it is,
I just don't believe

1059
01:00:09 --> 01:00:12
it in some sense.
 

1060
01:00:12 --> 01:00:16
AUDIENCE: Well I mean, if
I have that disorder and

[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].
 

1062
01:00:17 --> 01:00:20
PROFESSOR: Your hand.
 

1063
01:00:20 --> 01:00:20
That's interesting.
 

1064
01:00:20 --> 01:00:24
I'm not sure I've ever read
anything about whether people

1065
01:00:24 --> 01:00:29
deny their own-- in neglect you
would deny it was your own

1066
01:00:29 --> 01:00:32
hand, but in neglect typically
the hand would be paralyzed.

1067
01:00:32 --> 01:00:34
You wouldn't be doing anything
with it because of the

1068
01:00:34 --> 01:00:36
nature of the stroke.
 

1069
01:00:36 --> 01:00:39
 
 

1070
01:00:39 --> 01:00:40
I don't know.
 

1071
01:00:40 --> 01:00:44
I thought you were going to ask
whether I could look at that

1072
01:00:44 --> 01:00:47
water bottle and deny it was my
water bottle and it doesn't

1073
01:00:47 --> 01:00:49
seem to extend to objects.
 

1074
01:00:49 --> 01:00:54
It seems to be a very person
specific kind of delusion.

1075
01:00:54 --> 01:00:58
That it's about people and
about people with whom you have

1076
01:00:58 --> 01:01:01
strong affective relations.
 

1077
01:01:01 --> 01:01:05
Very sad kind of thing because
you read these anecdotes about

1078
01:01:05 --> 01:01:08
how would you feel because
typically somebody is in tough

1079
01:01:08 --> 01:01:12
shape for one reason or another
when they've got this disorder.

1080
01:01:12 --> 01:01:15
So you're visiting your kid
in hospital said he's busy

1081
01:01:15 --> 01:01:19
declaring you're an evil agent
who's disguised as Daddy.

1082
01:01:19 --> 01:01:23
You know, that must
be heartbreaking.

1083
01:01:23 --> 01:01:27
And I remember reading one
account where Daddy, in an

1084
01:01:27 --> 01:01:31
effort to cure the kid,
comes back and declares.

1085
01:01:31 --> 01:01:35
I did it, I killed him.
 

1086
01:01:35 --> 01:01:38
And I think the story was it
provided some temporary relief

1087
01:01:38 --> 01:01:41
and then it didn't stick.
 

1088
01:01:41 --> 01:01:44
But very weird stuff and very,
small, it's rare stuff;

1089
01:01:44 --> 01:01:45
small literature.
 

1090
01:01:45 --> 01:01:52
 
 

1091
01:01:52 --> 01:01:56
I just realized I suppose it
didn't matter, but I just

1092
01:01:56 --> 01:02:00
realized that if I'm going to
mike myself having discussions

1093
01:02:00 --> 01:02:03
during the break could
be a little risky.

1094
01:02:03 --> 01:02:05
I got to make sure that I'm
just talking about the details

1095
01:02:05 --> 01:02:08
of Capgras syndrome, which we
were as opposed to having a

1096
01:02:08 --> 01:02:14
discussion about--
I hate my TA.

1097
01:02:14 --> 01:02:16
Oh yeah, what's the
name of your TA?

1098
01:02:16 --> 01:02:20
 
 

1099
01:02:20 --> 01:02:20
That wouldn't work.
 

1100
01:02:20 --> 01:02:25
Or I love my TA, and nevermind.
 

1101
01:02:25 --> 01:02:29
Let's get onto
psychopathology--

1102
01:02:29 --> 01:02:32
my own and others.
 

1103
01:02:32 --> 01:02:35
The first thing to do is to say
something about the distinction

1104
01:02:35 --> 01:02:37
between a neuropathology and a
psychopathology, which might

1105
01:02:37 --> 01:02:42
seem a little weird in a course
that began by asserting the

1106
01:02:42 --> 01:02:44
mind is what the brain does.
 

1107
01:02:44 --> 01:02:49
I mean, in what sense can you
talk about neuropathology on

1108
01:02:49 --> 01:02:52
one side and a psychopathology
on the other?

1109
01:02:52 --> 01:02:56
I decided today and I'll see if
I still think tomorrow that

1110
01:02:56 --> 01:03:00
it's a useful distinction to
think of it sort of like a

1111
01:03:00 --> 01:03:03
hardware bugs versus
software bugs.

1112
01:03:03 --> 01:03:09
Same computer not working in
some interesting fashion or

1113
01:03:09 --> 01:03:12
other, but you can have a
problem because some piece

1114
01:03:12 --> 01:03:15
of the equipment is broken.
 

1115
01:03:15 --> 01:03:19
And you can have a problem
because the program running

1116
01:03:19 --> 01:03:23
over that equipment is
not working properly.

1117
01:03:23 --> 01:03:26
Now I realize as I'm saying
that that there is one problem

1118
01:03:26 --> 01:03:31
with that analogy, which is
that if I have a hardware bug

1119
01:03:31 --> 01:03:33
I'm going to be inclined to fix
the hardware and if I have a

1120
01:03:33 --> 01:03:37
software bug I'm going to be
inclined to fix the software.

1121
01:03:37 --> 01:03:40
That distinction is by no means
as clear in psychopathology

1122
01:03:40 --> 01:03:42
versus neuropathology.
 

1123
01:03:42 --> 01:03:48
So you can have a brain lesion
where the treatment is

1124
01:03:48 --> 01:03:52
essentially behavioral because
you want to do some sort of

1125
01:03:52 --> 01:03:55
retraining of the brain that
you've got left and you can

1126
01:03:55 --> 01:03:58
have a psychopathology, a
problem if you like with the

1127
01:03:58 --> 01:04:00
way that the software is
running where the intervention

1128
01:04:00 --> 01:04:04
is to give somebody a drug
that's doing its work

1129
01:04:04 --> 01:04:05
essentially on the hardware.
 

1130
01:04:05 --> 01:04:13
So the metaphor is not perfect,
but it gets at something.

1131
01:04:13 --> 01:04:13
Psychopathologies are...
 

1132
01:04:13 --> 01:04:17
 
 

1133
01:04:17 --> 01:04:19
it's worth thinking of as
problems with the way that the

1134
01:04:19 --> 01:04:24
program is using the brain.
 

1135
01:04:24 --> 01:04:26
Are there psychopathologies
that specifically

1136
01:04:26 --> 01:04:29
attack the self?
 

1137
01:04:29 --> 01:04:30
The answer is yes.
 

1138
01:04:30 --> 01:04:32
Those are what's known
in the trade as

1139
01:04:32 --> 01:04:34
dissociative disorders.
 

1140
01:04:34 --> 01:04:42
Much beloved of various and
sundry literary outlets, so the

1141
01:04:42 --> 01:04:47
cleanest one if you like is
psychogenic amnesia or

1142
01:04:47 --> 01:04:47
depersonalization.
 

1143
01:04:47 --> 01:04:51
 
 

1144
01:04:51 --> 01:04:56
Occasionally resorted to by
soap opera writers who have

1145
01:04:56 --> 01:04:59
backed themselves
into a corner.

1146
01:04:59 --> 01:05:02
That's the get a knock on the
head and I don't know who I

1147
01:05:02 --> 01:05:05
am, I don't know where I am.
 

1148
01:05:05 --> 01:05:08
And that allows you to do
a certain amount of plot

1149
01:05:08 --> 01:05:11
twiddling as needed.
 

1150
01:05:11 --> 01:05:14
Oh, let me say a word about--
now that we're talking about

1151
01:05:14 --> 01:05:18
psychopathology-- I need to say
something about psychiatric

1152
01:05:18 --> 01:05:26
hypochondria, which is
psychogenic amnesia.

1153
01:05:26 --> 01:05:30
Very rare, it's not
going to happen to you.

1154
01:05:30 --> 01:05:32
It's not even going to happen
to you after I tell you we

1155
01:05:32 --> 01:05:34
don't really know what the
cause is, but the best we know

1156
01:05:34 --> 01:05:38
about it is that it's a
response to severe stress.

1157
01:05:38 --> 01:05:43
The problem is, you say that
and people say "huhh!".

1158
01:05:43 --> 01:05:45
I'm under more stress than
I've ever been all my life.

1159
01:05:45 --> 01:05:49
I'm going to wake up tomorrow
and not going to know who I am.

1160
01:05:49 --> 01:05:51
Not going to happen,
very rare stuff.

1161
01:05:51 --> 01:05:57
But this is a close kin, this
is the intro psych kin, to med

1162
01:05:57 --> 01:06:01
student hypochondria which is
a very real known phenomenon.

1163
01:06:01 --> 01:06:04
Med students are always coming
down with spectacularly

1164
01:06:04 --> 01:06:07
rare diseases, at least
in their own minds.

1165
01:06:07 --> 01:06:11
You hear about some new set of
symptoms of some weird tropical

1166
01:06:11 --> 01:06:16
disorder and you can kind of--
is that like a tape worm

1167
01:06:16 --> 01:06:17
right about there?
 

1168
01:06:17 --> 01:06:20
They worry about
these things a lot.

1169
01:06:20 --> 01:06:23
And in the same way that they
probably don't have that tape

1170
01:06:23 --> 01:06:26
worm because you just
don't pick them up at

1171
01:06:26 --> 01:06:28
Harvard Med, mostly.
 

1172
01:06:28 --> 01:06:31
You shouldn't worry about
whether tomorrow you're

1173
01:06:31 --> 01:06:34
going to wake up without
knowing who you are.

1174
01:06:34 --> 01:06:37
Even though you may be under
a certain degree of stress.

1175
01:06:37 --> 01:06:41
That said, so let me
tell you one case.

1176
01:06:41 --> 01:06:46
A woman wakes up-- a woman is
found, actually in a bad state

1177
01:06:46 --> 01:06:50
under the bushes in Florida
somewhere back in 1980.

1178
01:06:50 --> 01:06:53
Doesn't know who she is.
 

1179
01:06:53 --> 01:06:57
Can't remember anything
about her past.

1180
01:06:57 --> 01:07:02
And eventually, in an effort to
figure out who she is and they

1181
01:07:02 --> 01:07:07
call her Jane Doe of course,
and then take her on morning TV

1182
01:07:07 --> 01:07:11
and ask basically, does
anybody know who I am?

1183
01:07:11 --> 01:07:15
And immediately got a string of
phone calls that suggested that

1184
01:07:15 --> 01:07:16
they knew exactly who she was.
 

1185
01:07:16 --> 01:07:23
She had apparently left Ohio a
few years earlier and moved to

1186
01:07:23 --> 01:07:24
Florida and then disappeared.
 

1187
01:07:24 --> 01:07:27
Her parents hadn't heard
from her for several years.

1188
01:07:27 --> 01:07:30
And unclear what happened
in this particular case,

1189
01:07:30 --> 01:07:32
atypically she did not
recover her memory.

1190
01:07:32 --> 01:07:37
Typically, these global
amnesias are transient.

1191
01:07:37 --> 01:07:39
In her case, at least at the
time of the report I was

1192
01:07:39 --> 01:07:43
reading, she had not
recovered her memory.

1193
01:07:43 --> 01:07:45
That's the most global,
if you like, of these

1194
01:07:45 --> 01:07:47
dissociative disorders.
 

1195
01:07:47 --> 01:07:50
 
 

1196
01:07:50 --> 01:07:58
Fugue states, from the Latin
word "to fly" are related.

1197
01:07:58 --> 01:08:02
Again, it's presumed to be a
response to severe stress.

1198
01:08:02 --> 01:08:05
There's a very nice case
described by William James

1199
01:08:05 --> 01:08:09
in his great Principles of
Psychology-- the best intro

1200
01:08:09 --> 01:08:14
text ever written in 1890,
so we can't still use it.

1201
01:08:14 --> 01:08:18
But he talks about the Reverend
Ansel Bourne who took some

1202
01:08:18 --> 01:08:19
money out of the bank
in Providence, Rhode

1203
01:08:19 --> 01:08:22
Island and vanished.
 

1204
01:08:22 --> 01:08:28
He reappeared-- well, he woke
up one morning in, I think,

1205
01:08:28 --> 01:08:33
Norristown, Pennsylvania and
discovered that for the past

1206
01:08:33 --> 01:08:37
two months he had been running
a store in the name of A.J.

1207
01:08:37 --> 01:08:39
Brown.
 

1208
01:08:39 --> 01:08:44
He had no recollection of
the preceding two months.

1209
01:08:44 --> 01:08:48
Hypnosis turns out to be a
useful, if somewhat mysterious

1210
01:08:48 --> 01:08:49
tool in such cases.
 

1211
01:08:49 --> 01:08:52
And James, who was very
interested in hypnosis found

1212
01:08:52 --> 01:08:55
that under hypnosis he could
sort of call up either

1213
01:08:55 --> 01:08:56
Brown or Bourne.
 

1214
01:08:56 --> 01:09:01
They didn't seem to know each
other, but what seems to have

1215
01:09:01 --> 01:09:04
happened was-- that the
characteristic of a fugue state

1216
01:09:04 --> 01:09:07
is that you disappear to
another location and pick

1217
01:09:07 --> 01:09:08
up another identity.
 

1218
01:09:08 --> 01:09:10
Now one of the interesting
things about this and it's

1219
01:09:10 --> 01:09:15
actually a theme that will
recur through a lot of

1220
01:09:15 --> 01:09:17
discussions of psychopathology.
 

1221
01:09:17 --> 01:09:22
Is that a fugue state is in a
sense an abnormal version

1222
01:09:22 --> 01:09:28
of something that we all
understand as a normal story.

1223
01:09:28 --> 01:09:33
In fact, most of us in our
family histories somewhere have

1224
01:09:33 --> 01:09:40
somebody back in Germany or
Poland or China or Russia or

1225
01:09:40 --> 01:09:43
Korea or somewhere who was
under a lot of stress in the

1226
01:09:43 --> 01:09:48
Old Country, picked up, and
developed a whole new identity

1227
01:09:48 --> 01:09:53
in the U.S. The major
difference of course, is that

1228
01:09:53 --> 01:09:56
grandpa remembered
the old country.

1229
01:09:56 --> 01:09:59
Grandpa hadn't suddenly just
gone poof and hey, now I'm

1230
01:09:59 --> 01:10:02
running a store in Brooklyn.
 

1231
01:10:02 --> 01:10:03
Nothing like that.
 

1232
01:10:03 --> 01:10:07
But the notion that a response
to an intolerable situation

1233
01:10:07 --> 01:10:11
here might be to move here is
sort of like the

1234
01:10:11 --> 01:10:12
American story.
 

1235
01:10:12 --> 01:10:18
The pathological aspect
is if you don't remember

1236
01:10:18 --> 01:10:20
what had happened before.
 

1237
01:10:20 --> 01:10:26
Now by the time you've got a
couple of different characters,

1238
01:10:26 --> 01:10:29
particularly, who can be called
in and out of awareness under

1239
01:10:29 --> 01:10:32
hypnosis, you are very close to
everybody's favorite

1240
01:10:32 --> 01:10:35
dissociative disorder,
long known as multiple

1241
01:10:35 --> 01:10:36
personality disorder.
 

1242
01:10:36 --> 01:10:40
Now more officially known as
dissociative identity disorder,

1243
01:10:40 --> 01:10:43
but I will continue to refer to
it as multiple personality

1244
01:10:43 --> 01:10:47
disorder because if I think
multiple personality disorder I

1245
01:10:47 --> 01:10:49
know what I mean immediately.
 

1246
01:10:49 --> 01:10:51
If I say dissociative
identity disorder I

1247
01:10:51 --> 01:10:53
have to think about it.
 

1248
01:10:53 --> 01:10:56
They are essentially
the same thing.

1249
01:10:56 --> 01:11:02
This is the situation in which
two or more personalities

1250
01:11:02 --> 01:11:08
appear to occupy the
same individual.

1251
01:11:08 --> 01:11:17
Popular with popular
supermarket psych books.

1252
01:11:17 --> 01:11:20
The great movie of my
youth was a movie called

1253
01:11:20 --> 01:11:21
Three Faces of Eve.
 

1254
01:11:21 --> 01:11:23
Has anybody ever seen it?
 

1255
01:11:23 --> 01:11:27
Oh good, must still be playing
in reruns on some old-- scared

1256
01:11:27 --> 01:11:29
the wits out of me
when I was little.

1257
01:11:29 --> 01:11:33
Can't remember anything about
it except that I mean, she

1258
01:11:33 --> 01:11:34
didn't have really three
faces, she did have

1259
01:11:34 --> 01:11:35
three personalities.
 

1260
01:11:35 --> 01:11:38
Let me tell you instead
about Billy Milligan,

1261
01:11:38 --> 01:11:39
a convicted rapist.
 

1262
01:11:39 --> 01:11:42
Not a nice person.
 

1263
01:11:42 --> 01:11:49
But one who attempted to get
off his conviction by claiming

1264
01:11:49 --> 01:11:51
a lack of responsibility
due to a multiple

1265
01:11:51 --> 01:11:53
personality disorder.
 

1266
01:11:53 --> 01:11:55
Depending on which of the
multiple accounts you read of

1267
01:11:55 --> 01:11:59
this he had anywhere between 10
and 24 personalities including

1268
01:11:59 --> 01:12:03
Arthur, a sort of master
personality who knew all

1269
01:12:03 --> 01:12:06
the others rattling
around inside him.

1270
01:12:06 --> 01:12:09
Arthur is reputed to know
Arabic and to be self- taught

1271
01:12:09 --> 01:12:11
in physics and chemistry.
 

1272
01:12:11 --> 01:12:17
Regen was aggressive, fluent in
Serbo-Croatian, spoke with a

1273
01:12:17 --> 01:12:21
thick accent and was reported
to be the initiator of

1274
01:12:21 --> 01:12:22
the sexual assaults.
 

1275
01:12:22 --> 01:12:28
Adalana is a shy, introverted
lesbian with a spontaneous

1276
01:12:28 --> 01:12:32
nystagmus, reported to
be the actual rapist.

1277
01:12:32 --> 01:12:36
Now there's a whole collection
of weird stuff there.

1278
01:12:36 --> 01:12:39
One point is that there's
no guarantee that all

1279
01:12:39 --> 01:12:41
the personalities
are the same gender.

1280
01:12:41 --> 01:12:43
 
 

1281
01:12:43 --> 01:12:46
A perhaps more salient point
here is this spontaneous

1282
01:12:46 --> 01:12:49
nystagmus thing.
 

1283
01:12:49 --> 01:12:52
And nystagmus is a beating
movement of the eyes.

1284
01:12:52 --> 01:12:55
It's hard to fake.
 

1285
01:12:55 --> 01:12:57
There's an argument about
whether multiple personality

1286
01:12:57 --> 01:13:00
disorder is for real.
 

1287
01:13:00 --> 01:13:02
And even if it is for real
there's always an argument in a

1288
01:13:02 --> 01:13:04
court case for whether or not
somebody's just trying to get

1289
01:13:04 --> 01:13:07
off the hook by faking it.
 

1290
01:13:07 --> 01:13:09
This spontaneous nystagmus
is important because

1291
01:13:09 --> 01:13:11
it's hard to fake.
 

1292
01:13:11 --> 01:13:13
If you sit there and try to
vibrate your eyes continuously

1293
01:13:13 --> 01:13:17
that's not easy.
 

1294
01:13:17 --> 01:13:20
So as Allen he's a con man,
Tommy knows electronics and

1295
01:13:20 --> 01:13:23
plays the sax, Samuel is an
Orthodox Jew and a woodcarver

1296
01:13:23 --> 01:13:26
and so on and so on and so on.
 

1297
01:13:26 --> 01:13:28
So it's very odd business.
 

1298
01:13:28 --> 01:13:35
On the face of it it's a
fragmentation of the self.

1299
01:13:35 --> 01:13:38
If you think of the self as a
kingdom this is like a bunch of

1300
01:13:38 --> 01:13:43
the provinces have rebelled and
they have complicated

1301
01:13:43 --> 01:13:44
diplomatic relationships
with each other.

1302
01:13:44 --> 01:13:45
Who knows who?
 

1303
01:13:45 --> 01:13:46
Who's talking to who?
 

1304
01:13:46 --> 01:13:47
Who likes who?
 

1305
01:13:47 --> 01:13:50
Very complicated
construct here.

1306
01:13:50 --> 01:13:54
Oh, one important way to
distinguish a psychopathology,

1307
01:13:54 --> 01:13:57
which if it's for real-- it
clearly is-- from a

1308
01:13:57 --> 01:14:03
neuropathology is nobody would
expect to put this guy in a

1309
01:14:03 --> 01:14:10
scanner and call up-- I don't
know-- Regen, the

1310
01:14:10 --> 01:14:13
Serbo-Croatian rapist and
find, there he is.

1311
01:14:13 --> 01:14:15
That piece of brain and now
the other guy's over here

1312
01:14:15 --> 01:14:17
and this guy's over here.
 

1313
01:14:17 --> 01:14:22
Look, they're all making
use of the same brain.

1314
01:14:22 --> 01:14:27
They're all forming memories,
for instance, and using

1315
01:14:27 --> 01:14:29
presumably the same
hippocampus to do it.

1316
01:14:29 --> 01:14:33
This is a case of very
odd software running

1317
01:14:33 --> 01:14:37
over the hardware.
 

1318
01:14:37 --> 01:14:39
So it's a troubling pathology.
 

1319
01:14:39 --> 01:14:40
Yep, there's a question?
 

1320
01:14:40 --> 01:14:42
AUDIENCE: What's the deal
with the eye beating and

1321
01:14:42 --> 01:14:43
why is that hard to fake?
 

1322
01:14:43 --> 01:14:44
PROFESSOR: Why is
it hard to fake?

1323
01:14:44 --> 01:14:47
Well, just sit yourself in
front-- well, you can't look at

1324
01:14:47 --> 01:14:49
your own eyes moving in the
mirror, so you can't

1325
01:14:49 --> 01:14:50
try it that way.
 

1326
01:14:50 --> 01:14:53
Pick a friend, look at a
friend, try to keep your eyes

1327
01:14:53 --> 01:14:58
beating rhythmically for five
minutes by an act of will.

1328
01:14:58 --> 01:15:00
Make sure you have
aspirin handy.

1329
01:15:00 --> 01:15:02
It's just very hard to do.
 

1330
01:15:02 --> 01:15:05
 
 

1331
01:15:05 --> 01:15:07
I can do all sorts of really
weird things with my eyes

1332
01:15:07 --> 01:15:09
actually, but that's
not a nystagmus.

1333
01:15:09 --> 01:15:13
That's some sort of
weird, spastic movement.

1334
01:15:13 --> 01:15:19
Even if you could produce a
movement any competent

1335
01:15:19 --> 01:15:23
opthamologist can look at a
nystagmus or you can record it

1336
01:15:23 --> 01:15:29
and know whether this is a
plausible neurological sign or

1337
01:15:29 --> 01:15:33
something weird that
the guy's doing.

1338
01:15:33 --> 01:15:33
Who knows?
 

1339
01:15:33 --> 01:15:38
You know, maybe he's a genius
at this sort of thing, but it

1340
01:15:38 --> 01:15:39
would be a hard thing to fake.
 

1341
01:15:39 --> 01:15:41
 
 

1342
01:15:41 --> 01:15:45
I don't think there's much more
to be said about it than that.

1343
01:15:45 --> 01:15:48
But this issue of whether it's
fake or not-- one of the other

1344
01:15:48 --> 01:15:51
arguments in favor of the
notion that there is a real

1345
01:15:51 --> 01:15:58
disorder is imagine you've got
24 personalities or imagine

1346
01:15:58 --> 01:16:03
your parents tell you-- how
many parents when you were

1347
01:16:03 --> 01:16:06
little made up some sort
of long-running story

1348
01:16:06 --> 01:16:08
that they told you?
 

1349
01:16:08 --> 01:16:10
No?
 

1350
01:16:10 --> 01:16:11
Oh good.
 

1351
01:16:11 --> 01:16:14
The rest of you was deprived.
 

1352
01:16:14 --> 01:16:16
They were just reading
out of the books.

1353
01:16:16 --> 01:16:18
Anyway, I used to have
a nice long-running

1354
01:16:18 --> 01:16:20
story about bunnies.
 

1355
01:16:20 --> 01:16:22
Very complicated stuff.
 

1356
01:16:22 --> 01:16:26
The problem is once there were
like 24 bunnies or whatever, I

1357
01:16:26 --> 01:16:29
don't remember how many there
were-- the kids would keep

1358
01:16:29 --> 01:16:32
calling me on errors.
 

1359
01:16:32 --> 01:16:34
No, no, he lives over there.
 

1360
01:16:34 --> 01:16:37
It's very difficult to keep
all this stuff straight.

1361
01:16:37 --> 01:16:42
If you have a story with 24
characters in it that you're

1362
01:16:42 --> 01:16:44
making up as a fake in your
own head you've got

1363
01:16:44 --> 01:16:46
to keep that lie.
 

1364
01:16:46 --> 01:16:48
Well, you don't have
to do stories.

1365
01:16:48 --> 01:16:50
Think of a good lie.
 

1366
01:16:50 --> 01:16:52
How many times when you were a
kid did you get stuck because

1367
01:16:52 --> 01:16:56
the lie fell apart because
you told it wrong?

1368
01:16:56 --> 01:16:57
You changed the story.
 

1369
01:16:57 --> 01:17:00
If it's a truth it's easy
enough because you just go back

1370
01:17:00 --> 01:17:03
and refer to the Truth and
it's just kind of there.

1371
01:17:03 --> 01:17:06
But the lie you have to
remember the details of and

1372
01:17:06 --> 01:17:08
there's an argument that the
same thing is going on here.

1373
01:17:08 --> 01:17:11
If you really had twenty-four
different personalities it'd be

1374
01:17:11 --> 01:17:14
just very difficult to keep
them straight unless you were

1375
01:17:14 --> 01:17:18
just reporting on-- so here's
Chuck, the personality,

1376
01:17:18 --> 01:17:19
who do you know?
 

1377
01:17:19 --> 01:17:20
I know boom, boom and boom.
 

1378
01:17:20 --> 01:17:24
If you're faking it-- you-- the
owner of this whole story have

1379
01:17:24 --> 01:17:27
to think, Chuck,
Chuck-- oh God.

1380
01:17:27 --> 01:17:30
I don't remember who
Chuck knows and so on.

1381
01:17:30 --> 01:17:35
Now a more troubling fact
perhaps, is that multiple

1382
01:17:35 --> 01:17:39
personality disorder was
practically not on the radar

1383
01:17:39 --> 01:17:40
screen twenty years ago.
 

1384
01:17:40 --> 01:17:42
When I first started talking
about multiple personality

1385
01:17:42 --> 01:17:45
disorder I could like read the
whole literature on this--

1386
01:17:45 --> 01:17:49
handful of cases from a
handful-- a handful of patients

1387
01:17:49 --> 01:17:51
from a handful of therapists.
 

1388
01:17:51 --> 01:17:53
In twenty years
it's skyrocketed.

1389
01:17:53 --> 01:17:56
It became sort of flavor of the
month, everybody had a multiple

1390
01:17:56 --> 01:17:59
personality disorder
for a while.

1391
01:17:59 --> 01:18:03
That's faded off a bit since
then, but that's odd.

1392
01:18:03 --> 01:18:04
Why should that be?
 

1393
01:18:04 --> 01:18:12
One theory is that is that it's
a well- intentioned delusion,

1394
01:18:12 --> 01:18:15
cooked up between a
therapist and a patient.

1395
01:18:15 --> 01:18:18
Patient's got some real
problem, the therapist believes

1396
01:18:18 --> 01:18:22
in multiple personality
disorder, and through the use

1397
01:18:22 --> 01:18:26
of hypnosis, which is a common
tool for therapists who treat

1398
01:18:26 --> 01:18:30
multiple personality disorder
you come to the conclusion--

1399
01:18:30 --> 01:18:34
you and the therapist come to
the conclusion that you have

1400
01:18:34 --> 01:18:37
more than one character
rattling around in there.

1401
01:18:37 --> 01:18:40
And that it wasn't real
before you came into

1402
01:18:40 --> 01:18:42
the therapist's office.
 

1403
01:18:42 --> 01:18:46
The counter argument to that is
that what brings people in

1404
01:18:46 --> 01:18:54
often is that they're missing
chunks of their lives.

1405
01:18:54 --> 01:18:56
You come to the
therapist's office.

1406
01:18:56 --> 01:19:00
You say look, I have no idea
what I did Tuesday afternoon,

1407
01:19:00 --> 01:19:05
but there's a new dress in my
closet and there's a charge

1408
01:19:05 --> 01:19:10
on my Visa card and
this is disturbing.

1409
01:19:10 --> 01:19:12
If things were happening to
you, you just didn't remember

1410
01:19:12 --> 01:19:14
it might eventually
get you into therapy.

1411
01:19:14 --> 01:19:19
 
 

1412
01:19:19 --> 01:19:22
AUDIENCE: Well, couldn't
multiple personality disorder

1413
01:19:22 --> 01:19:25
popularity skyrocket
after that movie came out

1414
01:19:25 --> 01:19:26
and everyone saw it?
 

1415
01:19:26 --> 01:19:28
PROFESSOR: Oh yes.
 

1416
01:19:28 --> 01:19:32
To anticipate what I will
actually end up getting to do

1417
01:19:32 --> 01:19:36
in next Tuesday's-- since
there's no class on Thursday--

1418
01:19:36 --> 01:19:42
there is a sense in which you
get to choose how to go insane.

1419
01:19:42 --> 01:19:48
The culture around you enables
certain forms of certain

1420
01:19:48 --> 01:19:51
patterns of mental
disorder and not others.

1421
01:19:51 --> 01:19:57
And sure, there's a lot
of this sort of copycat

1422
01:19:57 --> 01:19:59
cracking up, if you'd like.
 

1423
01:19:59 --> 01:20:01
Let me say one last thing
about this issue of what

1424
01:20:01 --> 01:20:03
gets people into therapy.
 

1425
01:20:03 --> 01:20:06
 
 

1426
01:20:06 --> 01:20:10
It's one thing to find a
dress in your closet.

1427
01:20:10 --> 01:20:12
The sort of thing that drives
you to the therapist really

1428
01:20:12 --> 01:20:18
quickly is you wake up in the
morning, there's a guy in bed

1429
01:20:18 --> 01:20:23
with you, it's pretty clear
that he's been there for awhile

1430
01:20:23 --> 01:20:27
and the suggestion is that
you've been doing stuff of some

1431
01:20:27 --> 01:20:32
sort and you don't
know who he is.

1432
01:20:32 --> 01:20:36
There's a lovely-- well,
lovely-- scary anecdote by one

1433
01:20:36 --> 01:20:41
patient where sort of a case
where bad girl/good

1434
01:20:41 --> 01:20:42
girl personalities.
 

1435
01:20:42 --> 01:20:45
The good girl didn't know the
bad girl personality, but the

1436
01:20:45 --> 01:20:48
bad girl knew the good girl
and the bad girl in therapy

1437
01:20:48 --> 01:20:50
said, oh, this is great.
 

1438
01:20:50 --> 01:20:52
She's such a prig.
 

1439
01:20:52 --> 01:20:56
So I take over and we go out
to a bar and pick up a guy.

1440
01:20:56 --> 01:21:00
I bring him home and you know,
we do stuff, and then I just

1441
01:21:00 --> 01:21:04
withdraw back into her and
watch the next morning.

1442
01:21:04 --> 01:21:08
It was great, man, she'd wake
up and she'd freak every time.

1443
01:21:08 --> 01:21:11
Well, you've got to imagine
the guy's point of view, too.

1444
01:21:11 --> 01:21:15
You know, guy comes home with
somebody, the next morning

1445
01:21:15 --> 01:21:17
she's ranting and raving that
she's never seen him before

1446
01:21:17 --> 01:21:18
and kicking him out the door.
 

1447
01:21:18 --> 01:21:21
It must be very strange for all
concerned, but is certainly the

1448
01:21:21 --> 01:21:24
sort of thing that would land
you wanting to talk to somebody

1449
01:21:24 --> 01:21:25
in the mental health field.
 

1450
01:21:25 --> 01:21:28
All right, we'll
pick up next week.
