#15 Bad Attitudes, Bad Behavior

 11/4/04 

Lecture 15  – Bad Attitudes, Bad Behavior 
The Abstract: In the first part of this lecture, I will discuss four factors that contribute
biased attitudes about groups of people: 
Factor 1:  Ethnocentrism - the "We're #1" phenomenon
Factor 2:  Stereotyping – The idea that "they" are all something else
Factor 3:  The fundamental attribution error – The over-application of a Trait Theory of
personality to other people.
Factor 4:  The role of ignorance in person perception 
In the second part of the lecture, I will describe some notable experiments that show how
surprisingly easy it is to make people do "bad" things. Let me stress that to explain biased
attitudes and bigoted behavior is not to condone them. Rather, it may be hoped the
knowledge might point to amelioration. 

Lecture Notes

Let us take as a given that racism and prejudice are bad.

There are two parts to the problem:

Racist attitudes 
Racist behavior 
Eisenhower: "You can't legislate morality."
Martin Luther King "but you can legislate moral behavior". 
IMPORTANT NOTE: TO EXPLAIN IS NOT TO EXCUSE 
Factor One: Ethnocentrism: 
What does Evolutionary Psychology have to say? 
Lab studies of "minimal group affiliation"

Tajfel et al (1971)  create some artifical groups

Part  1: Look at abstract art

and determine if like Klee better than Kandinsky or vice versa 
Part 2: Play a game with the following payoff choices 
choice 1: 
them $1 
us  $2 
choice 2: 
us  $3 
them $4 
What is the result? 
What is the point?

Factor Two: Stereotyping 

Stereotyping: the tendency to infer attributes on the basis of group membership

The self-evident bit: If "we're #1", then someone else is #2.

What becomes part of a stereotype? 

Silly example: Is bipedal part of the stereotype for blacks?

NOTE: THESE "DATA" ARE ALL OPINIONS. NOT FACT.

Guess which are parts of the German stereotype? 
What is the role of ignorance in stereotyping? 
Factor Three: The fundamental attribution error 
Stereotype matter because we think that traits are causal…in others. 
What does this mean? 
Trait theory  vs  Situationalism 
Nature 
………. Again 
vs  Nuture 
The  fundamental attribution error is a tendency to see the behavior of others
in terms of ____________ not _______________. 
E.g.  Why did you flunk the test?  Vs  Why did HE flunk the test? 
Factor Four:  The role of ignorance in person perception

ABOVE MAY BE YOUR GROUP OR ANOTHER 
Add to that the problem that you aren't as good at evaluating other groups as you are at
evaluating your own. This is seen in the good and bad distributions spreading out
so that the relative difference is smaller. 
THIS IS NOW THE OTHER GUYS

What were the data? 

How could this happen?

STRENGTH means authority of the experimenter. 

IMMEDIACY....How vivid/salient are the factors?
