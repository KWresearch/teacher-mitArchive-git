6
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
PROFESSOR: I'm not actually
going to use because I've

7
00:00:17 --> 00:00:21
discovered that-- and I need
the CD player later, but I did

8
00:00:21 --> 00:00:27
promise Simon, age eight, that
I would tell you all that he

9
00:00:27 --> 00:00:32
loaned me this boom box and
that you should know

10
00:00:32 --> 00:00:36
that this was his.
 

11
00:00:36 --> 00:00:37
And that I should
bring it back.

12
00:00:37 --> 00:00:42
 
 

13
00:00:42 --> 00:00:47
We were talking in the last
lecture about multiple

14
00:00:47 --> 00:00:55
personality disorder and my
recollection is that I left off

15
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
discussing the question of
whether or not it's

16
00:00:57 --> 00:00:59
a real thing.
 

17
00:00:59 --> 00:01:01
And I'd say that the burden
of evidence is that there

18
00:01:01 --> 00:01:04
really is a real problem
there of some sort.

19
00:01:04 --> 00:01:09
You know, people showing up at
their therapist's office

20
00:01:09 --> 00:01:14
saying, I don't remember this
big chunk of time in my life

21
00:01:14 --> 00:01:17
and then weird stuff
happened and so on.

22
00:01:17 --> 00:01:22
Those sorts of things point
to a real phenomenon.

23
00:01:22 --> 00:01:26
But there's this troubling
business that the disorder

24
00:01:26 --> 00:01:29
is new, relatively new.
 

25
00:01:29 --> 00:01:33
That there were very few
such cases in the 1970s.

26
00:01:33 --> 00:01:34
They start showing
up in the 80s.

27
00:01:34 --> 00:01:37
They're extremely
popular in the 90s.

28
00:01:37 --> 00:01:41
I'm not sure if they're
still as popular, but that

29
00:01:41 --> 00:01:43
there's a big upsurge.
 

30
00:01:43 --> 00:01:50
Now look, if there's a big
upsurge in flu this year we

31
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
sort of think we understand it.
 

32
00:01:52 --> 00:01:56
Some chicken in Thailand got
a new version of the flu

33
00:01:56 --> 00:01:58
and then we all get sick.
 

34
00:01:58 --> 00:02:03
But when that happens with a
psychiatric disorder there's

35
00:02:03 --> 00:02:06
no sense in which we think
that there's a pathogen

36
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
out there doing it.
 

37
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
What's the explanation?
 

38
00:02:10 --> 00:02:14
So I put the bones-- the
bare bones of one account

39
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
on the handout there.
 

40
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
The first of them is that while
multiple personality disorder

41
00:02:20 --> 00:02:25
might be a new entity.
 

42
00:02:25 --> 00:02:30
Or newly popular entity,
dissociation is not.

43
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
That dissociatve disorders
have a long history.

44
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
They have a long history in
psychiatry and they have an

45
00:02:37 --> 00:02:41
even longer history if you
start poking around in

46
00:02:41 --> 00:02:46
literature looking for
evidence of it in the past.

47
00:02:46 --> 00:02:51
It's just that Point 2 as
I recall on the handout.

48
00:02:51 --> 00:02:58
You get some choice in the
way that you manifest

49
00:02:58 --> 00:03:00
your mental illness.
 

50
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
The current way to manifest or
one of the leading current ways

51
00:03:03 --> 00:03:07
to manifest, whatever the
underlying problem is in

52
00:03:07 --> 00:03:12
dissociatve disorders is
multiple personality disorder.

53
00:03:12 --> 00:03:17
In prior eras or in other
places in the world the same

54
00:03:17 --> 00:03:19
underlying problem seems to
have shown up in

55
00:03:19 --> 00:03:20
different ways.
 

56
00:03:20 --> 00:03:24
 
 

57
00:03:24 --> 00:03:27
Multiple personality disorder--
one of the ways that it comes

58
00:03:27 --> 00:03:34
to our attention is when
somebody says look, I know you

59
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
caught me doing this, but I'm
not guilty because

60
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
it wasn't me.
 

61
00:03:40 --> 00:03:49
It was this other piece
that somehow is not me.

62
00:03:49 --> 00:03:53
And therefore, I don't have
personal responsibility

63
00:03:53 --> 00:03:54
for that act.
 

64
00:03:54 --> 00:03:59
That's an interesting question
in the interface between

65
00:03:59 --> 00:04:00
the law and psychology.
 

66
00:04:00 --> 00:04:02
How should we understand that?
 

67
00:04:02 --> 00:04:07
Does it make sense to say, you
don't need to go to jail for

68
00:04:07 --> 00:04:13
this crime because it was done
by something that looks like

69
00:04:13 --> 00:04:17
you, but isn't you
in some sense.

70
00:04:17 --> 00:04:22
That's an interesting topic
for recitation perhaps.

71
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
Things of a similar sort
occur throughout history.

72
00:04:25 --> 00:04:32
So for instance, think back
into medieval culture or into

73
00:04:32 --> 00:04:38
various parts of the world
today where the idea of demonic

74
00:04:38 --> 00:04:44
posession let's say is
taken as a real option.

75
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
Why did you do X?
 

76
00:04:46 --> 00:04:51
I did this because I was
possessed or the cliche, which

77
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
I can't remember which TV show
it was where that the tagline

78
00:04:54 --> 00:04:55
was "the devil made me do it".
 

79
00:04:55 --> 00:05:00
That's sort of a modern pop
version of a seriously

80
00:05:00 --> 00:05:06
considered hypothesis that's
been popular in western

81
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
civilization and
elsewhere in the world.

82
00:05:08 --> 00:05:10
I don't have anything
particular to say about whether

83
00:05:10 --> 00:05:13
or not there is such a thing as
the real entity of demonic

84
00:05:13 --> 00:05:18
possession, but you got to see
the possibility that something

85
00:05:18 --> 00:05:23
external takes control of you
and makes you do things that

86
00:05:23 --> 00:05:28
you wouldn't otherwise do as
having a very similar shape to

87
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
what we now call multiple
personality disorder.

88
00:05:30 --> 00:05:34
Or if you go into the 19th
century there are lots of

89
00:05:34 --> 00:05:39
literary cases, you may have
read some of these in novels

90
00:05:39 --> 00:05:46
where a dead relative
typically takes over a

91
00:05:46 --> 00:05:48
living person's body.
 

92
00:05:48 --> 00:05:52
You know, somebody's soul is
unquiet and their spirit is

93
00:05:52 --> 00:05:57
wandering the world and they
take over somebody else and

94
00:05:57 --> 00:06:02
you do stuff that you hadn't
particularly intended to do.

95
00:06:02 --> 00:06:09
Again, this notion of an
external something taking over

96
00:06:09 --> 00:06:12
what would normally be the
volitional, conscious part of

97
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
your mind and making
you do stuff.

98
00:06:15 --> 00:06:21
So it's possible that multiple
personality disorder is merely

99
00:06:21 --> 00:06:25
the current version of, if you
like, trick of the mind that

100
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
has existed for a long time.
 

101
00:06:27 --> 00:06:31
Now why did it disappear?
 

102
00:06:31 --> 00:06:35
Why did the dissociative
disorders as a whole disappear?

103
00:06:35 --> 00:06:41
It disappeared in American
and European psychology

104
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
early mid 20th century.
 

105
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
Perhaps the best way to
say it would be that

106
00:06:45 --> 00:06:47
Freud made a mistake.
 

107
00:06:47 --> 00:06:58
Freud was seeing patients with
similar sorts of problems, but

108
00:06:58 --> 00:07:01
he saw something
else he thought.

109
00:07:01 --> 00:07:05
To explain that it'll help to
say a bit first of all, about

110
00:07:05 --> 00:07:09
what causes multiple
personality disorder and then

111
00:07:09 --> 00:07:13
to say a lot more about
what Freud thought.

112
00:07:13 --> 00:07:16
Multiple personality disorder,
like the other dissociative

113
00:07:16 --> 00:07:22
disorders is associated
with stress.

114
00:07:22 --> 00:07:26
It's a disorder of severe
stress, but one of the things

115
00:07:26 --> 00:07:32
you see in patient account
after patient account is a

116
00:07:32 --> 00:07:37
particular kind of stress,
specifically childhood abuse

117
00:07:37 --> 00:07:41
and very frequently within that
set, childhood sexual abuse.

118
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
 
 

119
00:07:44 --> 00:07:47
One way of describing multiple
personality disorder-- I'm

120
00:07:47 --> 00:07:52
roughly quoting I think, from a
therapist named Ross, is that

121
00:07:52 --> 00:07:56
multiple personality disorder
is a little girl saying that

122
00:07:56 --> 00:07:58
the abuse is happening
to somebody else.

123
00:07:58 --> 00:08:01
Why a little girl?
 

124
00:08:01 --> 00:08:05
Multiple personality disorder
is a diagnosis that has about

125
00:08:05 --> 00:08:08
a 9:1 female to male ratio.
 

126
00:08:08 --> 00:08:13
It's a very heavily
female diagnosis.

127
00:08:13 --> 00:08:16
This is not to say-- there are
a bunch of disorders where

128
00:08:16 --> 00:08:20
there's great asymmetry in
which sex manifests

129
00:08:20 --> 00:08:21
the disorder.
 

130
00:08:21 --> 00:08:25
This isn't to say that women
are somehow the fragile sex

131
00:08:25 --> 00:08:30
whose self is going to crack
up while us strong guys, you

132
00:08:30 --> 00:08:33
know, are doing all right.
 

133
00:08:33 --> 00:08:39
If you were looking for a male
disorder, what might that be?

134
00:08:39 --> 00:08:40
AUDIENCE: Alcoholism?
 

135
00:08:40 --> 00:08:45
PROFESSOR: Alcoholism, I'm
not sure is actually.

136
00:08:45 --> 00:08:47
I don't know, but I don't
think that it's particularly

137
00:08:47 --> 00:08:51
heavily divided between
male and female.

138
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
Yes?
 

139
00:08:53 --> 00:08:54
AUDIENCE: Autism?
 

140
00:08:54 --> 00:08:56
PROFESSOR: Autism.
 

141
00:08:56 --> 00:09:01
I think that's right, but these
days we tend to think of that

142
00:09:01 --> 00:09:08
less as a psychiatric then
as a neuropsych disorder.

143
00:09:08 --> 00:09:09
Any autism experts?
 

144
00:09:09 --> 00:09:11
Autism is heavily male?
 

145
00:09:11 --> 00:09:12
Yeah, that sounds right.
 

146
00:09:12 --> 00:09:12
Yes?
 

147
00:09:12 --> 00:09:13
AUDIENCE: Serial killers.
 

148
00:09:13 --> 00:09:14
PROFESSOR: Serial killers.
 

149
00:09:14 --> 00:09:18
How many female serial killer--
well, you don't even have

150
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
to be serial about it.
 

151
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
Just regular old killer
will do, right?

152
00:09:23 --> 00:09:28
 
 

153
00:09:28 --> 00:09:32
Now it's interesting that we
don't tend to typically think

154
00:09:32 --> 00:09:37
of these primarily as a
psychiatric diagnosis, but if

155
00:09:37 --> 00:09:41
you ask who gets in trouble
for aggression that's

156
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
very heavily males.
 

157
00:09:44 --> 00:09:50
So sexual assault, murder,
various other forms of

158
00:09:50 --> 00:09:55
assault-- very heavily
populated by males.

159
00:09:55 --> 00:09:59
Dissociative disorders in the
present era, at least, heavily

160
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
populated by females.
 

161
00:10:01 --> 00:10:06
So why might this history--
well, I already gave you a hint

162
00:10:06 --> 00:10:10
about why this history of
child and sexual abuse

163
00:10:10 --> 00:10:14
might be causative.
 

164
00:10:14 --> 00:10:16
One way of thinking about
multiple personality disorder

165
00:10:16 --> 00:10:21
is as a maladaptive,
adaptive response.

166
00:10:21 --> 00:10:24
What the world's that mean?
 

167
00:10:24 --> 00:10:28
Suppose something really
terrible is happening to you

168
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
and certainly childhood
sexual assault would count.

169
00:10:31 --> 00:10:35
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

170
00:10:35 --> 00:10:42
Well one way to deal with that
intolerable situation would be

171
00:10:42 --> 00:10:48
to somehow make it something
that's happening not to you, to

172
00:10:48 --> 00:10:52
some other entity
that is not you.

173
00:10:52 --> 00:10:54
Now this isn't obviously
a conscious choice.

174
00:10:54 --> 00:10:58
You don't sit there as an
abused child and say, oh look,

175
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
I think I'll create a
sequestered piece of my psyche

176
00:11:01 --> 00:11:05
that I can put all this pain on
and if I'm clever not even

177
00:11:05 --> 00:11:08
remember that it
happened to me.

178
00:11:08 --> 00:11:13
This is something that happens
rather than something

179
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
that is chosen.
 

180
00:11:15 --> 00:11:19
And it has a certain adaptive
value in protecting, if you

181
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
like, some core of the self.
 

182
00:11:21 --> 00:11:27
But it's also obviously, not
an ideal way of dealing with

183
00:11:27 --> 00:11:31
stress, problems, pain and
becomes even less ideal if it

184
00:11:31 --> 00:11:35
becomes a sort of a trope, a
trick that you use repeatedly.

185
00:11:35 --> 00:11:37
All right, well, this
worked for this disaster

186
00:11:37 --> 00:11:38
of my childhood.
 

187
00:11:38 --> 00:11:42
Now if I'm having
relationships, they're

188
00:11:42 --> 00:11:44
kind of stressful.
 

189
00:11:44 --> 00:11:49
So maybe I'll wall off
relationship person here.

190
00:11:49 --> 00:11:53
You know, calculus, that's
pretty tough and so on.

191
00:11:53 --> 00:11:59
You could imagine that you
develop this trick of saying,

192
00:11:59 --> 00:12:03
you know, we all talk about
people who compartmentalize.

193
00:12:03 --> 00:12:07
Well, this is a case of
compartmentalizing where you're

194
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
cracking up, literally.
 

195
00:12:09 --> 00:12:13
You're taking an otherwise
unitary self and breaking

196
00:12:13 --> 00:12:14
it into little pieces.
 

197
00:12:14 --> 00:12:17
 
 

198
00:12:17 --> 00:12:23
The fundamental mistake Freud
made was that he also, his

199
00:12:23 --> 00:12:26
clientele, his primary
clientele probably

200
00:12:26 --> 00:12:27
were young women.
 

201
00:12:27 --> 00:12:32
And they also were telling
him tales of childhood

202
00:12:32 --> 00:12:33
sexual abuse.
 

203
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
 
 

204
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
He concluded they were wrong.
 

205
00:12:38 --> 00:12:42
He concluded that
this was a delusion.

206
00:12:42 --> 00:12:43
Why?
 

207
00:12:43 --> 00:12:47
There are a number of possible
reasons why he got it wrong.

208
00:12:47 --> 00:12:51
Not the least of which, is that
these were the daughters of men

209
00:12:51 --> 00:12:55
of his own social class-- his
neighbors, his friends, people

210
00:12:55 --> 00:13:02
he knew in many cases, and he
simply and perhaps, in some

211
00:13:02 --> 00:13:05
sense, lacked the imagination.
 

212
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
Sort of the horror movie
imagination to imagine that

213
00:13:09 --> 00:13:14
these women had been abused by
the men in their lives who he

214
00:13:14 --> 00:13:16
in fact knew or knew
people like them.

215
00:13:16 --> 00:13:20
He just didn't think that
that was plausible.

216
00:13:20 --> 00:13:22
Plus, he had a theoretical
framework that gave him a

217
00:13:22 --> 00:13:33
different understanding of what
was going on and we'll come

218
00:13:33 --> 00:13:37
back to that in-- well, no
we won't come back to that.

219
00:13:37 --> 00:13:38
We'll do that right now.
 

220
00:13:38 --> 00:13:41
Look, one of the things that
Frued believed fundamentally

221
00:13:41 --> 00:13:44
was that the mind was unified.
 

222
00:13:44 --> 00:13:49
He didn't see disassociation
because he didn't think that

223
00:13:49 --> 00:13:52
disassociation was something
that really happened.

224
00:13:52 --> 00:13:57
He thought that the mind was--
well, here, if this is the

225
00:13:57 --> 00:14:02
dissociation model here's a
sort of a Freudian model.

226
00:14:02 --> 00:14:07
It's not actually his
metaphor, but it'll work.

227
00:14:07 --> 00:14:11
Freud thought that the
mind was a unitary whole.

228
00:14:11 --> 00:14:20
That there was a conscious part
of this whole-- that's this

229
00:14:20 --> 00:14:23
little king or queen on
the top of the castle.

230
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
Ain't it beautiful?
 

231
00:14:25 --> 00:14:33
And then this conscious guy got
access to a lot of stuff, so

232
00:14:33 --> 00:14:39
here's the pre-conscious and
it's sort of like long-term

233
00:14:39 --> 00:14:42
memory or the big semantic
network that you've got

234
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
up in your head or
something like that.

235
00:14:44 --> 00:14:45
It's the stuff that
you got access to.

236
00:14:45 --> 00:14:51
So at this event this Thursday
they're going to serve what?

237
00:14:51 --> 00:14:52
AUDIENCE: Ice cream.
 

238
00:14:52 --> 00:14:53
PROFESSOR: Ice cream, right.
 

239
00:14:53 --> 00:14:56
OK, you weren't sitting there
the whole time that I've been

240
00:14:56 --> 00:14:59
talking unless you're a pretty
weird, obsessive sort going

241
00:14:59 --> 00:15:00
ice cream, ice cream.
 

242
00:15:00 --> 00:15:02
Ice cream's in my conscious.
 

243
00:15:02 --> 00:15:03
No, it was there.
 

244
00:15:03 --> 00:15:04
You could get to it.
 

245
00:15:04 --> 00:15:05
It's in your pre-conscious.
 

246
00:15:05 --> 00:15:08
 
 

247
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
Freud acknowledged certainly
that there was stuff that you

248
00:15:11 --> 00:15:16
didn't have access to and that
was what was living in the

249
00:15:16 --> 00:15:21
Freudian unconscious, which I
will put down--

250
00:15:21 --> 00:15:26
unconsciousness-- which I will
put down here sort of

251
00:15:26 --> 00:15:27
in the dungeon.
 

252
00:15:27 --> 00:15:30
 
 

253
00:15:30 --> 00:15:33
That's the stairs down.
 

254
00:15:33 --> 00:15:38
Somewhat different, both
similar and different to the

255
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
unconscious processes that
we've talked about so far.

256
00:15:41 --> 00:15:45
We've already talked about, in
many aspects of the course, the

257
00:15:45 --> 00:15:48
notion that there are processes
that go on outside

258
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
of your awareness.
 

259
00:15:52 --> 00:16:00
Freud's unconscious will turn
out to be somewhat different.

260
00:16:00 --> 00:16:04
Before I launch into explaining
that though, I ought to explain

261
00:16:04 --> 00:16:08
more generally why I'm going to
talk about Freud as much

262
00:16:08 --> 00:16:10
as I am all together.
 

263
00:16:10 --> 00:16:13
The reason I need to explain
that is that if you were taking

264
00:16:13 --> 00:16:22
this course at most other--
probably a majority of other

265
00:16:22 --> 00:16:25
fine institutions of higher
learning around the country,

266
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
you'd probably get less Freud
than you're getting here.

267
00:16:27 --> 00:16:31
I'm out on one end of the
distribution on that.

268
00:16:31 --> 00:16:35
Many people in academic
psychology subscribe to the

269
00:16:35 --> 00:16:40
line attributed to some
professor of this course at a

270
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
big midwestern state university
who said, look, there's

271
00:16:43 --> 00:16:46
only two things you need
to know about Freud.

272
00:16:46 --> 00:16:50
He's wrong and he's dead.
 

273
00:16:50 --> 00:16:54
Now I wouldn't try that as
the answer on the final.

274
00:16:54 --> 00:16:59
Though both of those statements
are in indisputably true.

275
00:16:59 --> 00:17:03
 
 

276
00:17:03 --> 00:17:07
So all right, why
talk about him?

277
00:17:07 --> 00:17:08
There are a couple of reasons.
 

278
00:17:08 --> 00:17:14
One reason is that the
influence of Freud is so

279
00:17:14 --> 00:17:20
widespread in the culture that
it would be a disservice to

280
00:17:20 --> 00:17:25
people taking an introductory
level course not to talk about

281
00:17:25 --> 00:17:30
it at some length because we
all use the vocabulary.

282
00:17:30 --> 00:17:34
We all sit around yacking about
our friends and neighbors

283
00:17:34 --> 00:17:41
saying, my he's got a big ego
and she is so anal and both of

284
00:17:41 --> 00:17:48
them are in denial and--
oh, I could keep going.

285
00:17:48 --> 00:17:52
There's a whole vocabulary
that is borrowed from Freud.

286
00:17:52 --> 00:17:57
It's often used in ways that
would cause Freud to cringe, no

287
00:17:57 --> 00:18:02
doubt if he heard us using the
way we do today, but that's

288
00:18:02 --> 00:18:04
where the language comes from.
 

289
00:18:04 --> 00:18:08
The influence is so widespread
that you need to know about it.

290
00:18:08 --> 00:18:11
The other reason is I think
that while Freud is

291
00:18:11 --> 00:18:18
demonstrably wrong on point
after point after point he is

292
00:18:18 --> 00:18:22
right or at least interesting
on a number of large scale

293
00:18:22 --> 00:18:28
issues that deserve
consideration.

294
00:18:28 --> 00:18:33
He's wrong in the way
that Darwin is wrong.

295
00:18:33 --> 00:18:38
Or the way-- pick your favorite
18th, 19th century giant of

296
00:18:38 --> 00:18:40
science-- they're all wrong.
 

297
00:18:40 --> 00:18:41
They're also all dead.
 

298
00:18:41 --> 00:18:44
 
 

299
00:18:44 --> 00:18:48
But the way we play the science
game of course is that we build

300
00:18:48 --> 00:18:50
on-- yeah, yeah,
yeah, all right.

301
00:18:50 --> 00:18:53
So Darwin didn't get this bit
right, but I can modify

302
00:18:53 --> 00:18:56
Darwin's theory and I can be a
neo-Darwinian or something

303
00:18:56 --> 00:18:58
and build on it.
 

304
00:18:58 --> 00:19:06
The problem with Freud was that
his disciples and the word is

305
00:19:06 --> 00:19:10
chosen deliberately, treated
his writings-- particularly

306
00:19:10 --> 00:19:14
after he was no longer around
to revise them-- more closely

307
00:19:14 --> 00:19:19
as holy writ than as
scientific theory.

308
00:19:19 --> 00:19:24
With the result that they're
developed in psychology--

309
00:19:24 --> 00:19:27
particularly in the sort of
clinical side of psychology,

310
00:19:27 --> 00:19:31
this sort of you're either
with us or against us notion.

311
00:19:31 --> 00:19:35
That if you questioned one of
the tenants of the master you

312
00:19:35 --> 00:19:39
were not just another scientist
attempting to revise Darwin or

313
00:19:39 --> 00:19:41
Newton or whoever you
want to be revising.

314
00:19:41 --> 00:19:45
You were an anti-Freudian.
 

315
00:19:45 --> 00:19:49
So there ended up being this
split between the people who

316
00:19:49 --> 00:19:53
thought that the canon was
fixed in some sense and the

317
00:19:53 --> 00:19:58
people who didn't and once you
get passed as you're the

318
00:19:58 --> 00:20:02
opposition well, you just sit
down and check off why he's

319
00:20:02 --> 00:20:03
dead and he's wrong and we
don't need to think

320
00:20:03 --> 00:20:05
about it anymore.
 

321
00:20:05 --> 00:20:08
So there's a sort of a
historical-- it's not an

322
00:20:08 --> 00:20:13
accident-- but it's sort of
an accidental reason why

323
00:20:13 --> 00:20:15
he's fallen out of favor.
 

324
00:20:15 --> 00:20:21
My hunch is that were Freud
still alive that he would

325
00:20:21 --> 00:20:24
be more than happy
to say, oh yeah.

326
00:20:24 --> 00:20:26
Got it wrong big time on
this, this, and this.

327
00:20:26 --> 00:20:28
Let's see what we can
salvage of the theory

328
00:20:28 --> 00:20:31
and move bits around.
 

329
00:20:31 --> 00:20:33
I put one Drew Westen
quote on the handout.

330
00:20:33 --> 00:20:37
The other good Drew Westen
quote from the same article is

331
00:20:37 --> 00:20:41
that "since Freud's death in
1939 he has been slow to revise

332
00:20:41 --> 00:20:44
his theory." And that's true.
 

333
00:20:44 --> 00:20:48
 
 

334
00:20:48 --> 00:20:51
And that's perhaps a pity.
 

335
00:20:51 --> 00:20:57
What Freud was trying
to do-- well, look.

336
00:20:57 --> 00:21:00
It says what Freud
was trying to do.

337
00:21:00 --> 00:21:03
He was trying to understand why
we do things and why we think

338
00:21:03 --> 00:21:07
things that we don't seem
to want to do or think.

339
00:21:07 --> 00:21:09
Well look, so was he
on to something?

340
00:21:09 --> 00:21:14
Has anybody here ever
done something that

341
00:21:14 --> 00:21:15
they didn't want to do?
 

342
00:21:15 --> 00:21:18
 
 

343
00:21:18 --> 00:21:20
Yeah, I know people who weren't
putting up their hands are the

344
00:21:20 --> 00:21:23
ones who are still reading
The Tech there or something.

345
00:21:23 --> 00:21:23
Right?
 

346
00:21:23 --> 00:21:25
Of course, everybody does that.
 

347
00:21:25 --> 00:21:28
Well you can need to do that
because somebody's going to hit

348
00:21:28 --> 00:21:29
you if you-- how many people?
 

349
00:21:29 --> 00:21:31
So OK, saw lots of hands there.
 

350
00:21:31 --> 00:21:34
How many people have ever done
something they didn't want

351
00:21:34 --> 00:21:40
to do even without any
obvious overt coercion?

352
00:21:40 --> 00:21:42
Or failed to do something
that they did want to do?

353
00:21:42 --> 00:21:48
You didn't talk to her
or you did talk to her.

354
00:21:48 --> 00:21:50
How many people have ever just
done something they didn't want

355
00:21:50 --> 00:21:56
to do and there wasn't anybody
with a gun or anything.

356
00:21:56 --> 00:21:58
So, Freud's onto
something there, right?

357
00:21:58 --> 00:22:04
I mean, this is a serious
question why people-- and I

358
00:22:04 --> 00:22:08
should note that this doesn't
mean that you're nuts.

359
00:22:08 --> 00:22:12
It doesn't mean that your self
has fractured into little

360
00:22:12 --> 00:22:16
pieces and that the reason that
you did whatever it is-- you

361
00:22:16 --> 00:22:25
ate the M&M's or you drank the
two espressos at midnight when

362
00:22:25 --> 00:22:27
you thought you were going to
bed or something like that.

363
00:22:27 --> 00:22:33
You know, whatever it is, you
didn't do it because Irving--

364
00:22:33 --> 00:22:37
the other piece of you--
suddenly took over.

365
00:22:37 --> 00:22:40
It's just the way
we seem to be.

366
00:22:40 --> 00:22:43
For all that we think that
we're king of the castle or

367
00:22:43 --> 00:22:46
queen of the castle we don't
seem to have the degree of

368
00:22:46 --> 00:22:50
control over ourselves
that we might want.

369
00:22:50 --> 00:22:52
Why is that?
 

370
00:22:52 --> 00:22:55
 
 

371
00:22:55 --> 00:22:56
That's the fundamental
scientific problem that

372
00:22:56 --> 00:22:59
Freud was trying to get at.
 

373
00:22:59 --> 00:23:02
And he was particularly
interested in the cases where

374
00:23:02 --> 00:23:07
this went sufficiently off the
rails that people were doing

375
00:23:07 --> 00:23:11
things that they didn't want to
do that we're getting them

376
00:23:11 --> 00:23:14
into real or at least,
psychological trouble.

377
00:23:14 --> 00:23:16
They were in psychological
pain of some variety and

378
00:23:16 --> 00:23:18
needed to deal with this.
 

379
00:23:18 --> 00:23:21
Most of us are just doing
things we don't want to do

380
00:23:21 --> 00:23:24
and surviving well
enough with that.

381
00:23:24 --> 00:23:27
Thank you.
 

382
00:23:27 --> 00:23:32
In the case of multiple
personality disorder or of

383
00:23:32 --> 00:23:35
these patients who came to
Freud saying that they'd been

384
00:23:35 --> 00:23:40
sexually abused in many cases,
Freud concluded that this was a

385
00:23:40 --> 00:23:44
delusional thought on the
part of his patients.

386
00:23:44 --> 00:23:54
What he thought was that these
were women saying that I-- or

387
00:23:54 --> 00:24:01
not saying, I desire my father
or some other male in an

388
00:24:01 --> 00:24:03
inappropriate kind of a way.
 

389
00:24:03 --> 00:24:06
That that would be an
unacceptable desire.

390
00:24:06 --> 00:24:09
And what they had done to
defend themselves against this

391
00:24:09 --> 00:24:13
unacceptable thought was to
engage in what Freud called

392
00:24:13 --> 00:24:21
projection; an act of the mind
where you flip the actors, the

393
00:24:21 --> 00:24:24
subject and the object in
that sentence around.

394
00:24:24 --> 00:24:29
So he was thinking he was
hearing daddy wants me and he

395
00:24:29 --> 00:24:34
was concluding that what the
woman was saying really

396
00:24:34 --> 00:24:36
was, I want daddy.
 

397
00:24:36 --> 00:24:40
He was probably wrong about
that, but was he completely

398
00:24:40 --> 00:24:41
wrong about the notion that
there's something

399
00:24:41 --> 00:24:42
like projection.
 

400
00:24:42 --> 00:24:44
How wacko is that?
 

401
00:24:44 --> 00:24:47
Well, all right here,
think of the following:

402
00:24:47 --> 00:24:50
How many people here can think
back into typically sort of

403
00:24:50 --> 00:24:54
like elementary school, though
it could be college, it'll

404
00:24:54 --> 00:25:01
work-- where you had a
teacher who hated you.

405
00:25:01 --> 00:25:03
How many people at least
remember thinking that

406
00:25:03 --> 00:25:05
their teacher hated them?
 

407
00:25:05 --> 00:25:06
All right, now look.
 

408
00:25:06 --> 00:25:08
Odds are that most of you have
always been pretty good

409
00:25:08 --> 00:25:10
students, by the way, right?
 

410
00:25:10 --> 00:25:13
You didn't get here by being
the sort of students who

411
00:25:13 --> 00:25:18
teachers routinely hate even
if teachers do hate students,

412
00:25:18 --> 00:25:20
which I don't think
they do all that much.

413
00:25:20 --> 00:25:24
Otherwise nobody in their right
mind would teach middle school.

414
00:25:24 --> 00:25:27
If you were inclined to hate
students you'd run screaming

415
00:25:27 --> 00:25:29
from that assignment
after the first week.

416
00:25:29 --> 00:25:34
But anyway, so if you think
about that teacher who hated

417
00:25:34 --> 00:25:37
you, you know, odds
are they didn't.

418
00:25:37 --> 00:25:39
But where does this idea come?
 

419
00:25:39 --> 00:25:43
You must have been in some
conflict with this teacher,

420
00:25:43 --> 00:25:45
at least in your own mind.
 

421
00:25:45 --> 00:25:48
It is possible that you
conjured up in your mind at

422
00:25:48 --> 00:25:53
some place in your mind the
thought, I don't like Mrs.

423
00:25:53 --> 00:25:55
McDonald, my third
grade teacher.

424
00:25:55 --> 00:25:58
 
 

425
00:25:58 --> 00:26:03
But then some other little
chunk of my mind says,

426
00:26:03 --> 00:26:05
that's not a good
thought for me to have.

427
00:26:05 --> 00:26:08
I'm not the kind of person
who hates my teacher.

428
00:26:08 --> 00:26:12
So Mrs. McDonald hates me.
 

429
00:26:12 --> 00:26:15
 
 

430
00:26:15 --> 00:26:18
That's why she gives me
bad marks in penmanship.

431
00:26:18 --> 00:26:23
I was so glad when penmanship
went off the report card.

432
00:26:23 --> 00:26:25
Which, it was there all the way
through elementary school and

433
00:26:25 --> 00:26:27
it was always the black mark on
my-- because nobody could

434
00:26:27 --> 00:26:30
read what I was writing.
 

435
00:26:30 --> 00:26:35
But anyway, so projection, even
if Freud got it wrong about the

436
00:26:35 --> 00:26:38
notion that even if he ended up
systematically denying the

437
00:26:38 --> 00:26:42
possibility that his patients
were actually abused, the

438
00:26:42 --> 00:26:46
notion that you could have a
trick of mind that would do

439
00:26:46 --> 00:26:54
this, you know, subject object
reversal that's not as unlikely

440
00:26:54 --> 00:26:58
as it might otherwise sound.
 

441
00:26:58 --> 00:27:01
 
 

442
00:27:01 --> 00:27:03
So he systematically didn't
believe in dissociation.

443
00:27:03 --> 00:27:05
It wasn't that dissociation
wasn't known.

444
00:27:05 --> 00:27:09
If we didn't know about Freud,
if Freud had not existed I

445
00:27:09 --> 00:27:13
would probably be giving a sort
of working historical lecture

446
00:27:13 --> 00:27:17
about Pierre Janet who was the
leading-- in France he was

447
00:27:17 --> 00:27:19
a leading psychologist.
 

448
00:27:19 --> 00:27:22
I think, actually wrote a book
with a title like Dissociation.

449
00:27:22 --> 00:27:26
Dissociation was something
that 19th century psychology

450
00:27:26 --> 00:27:31
believed in and Freud
killed off for awhile.

451
00:27:31 --> 00:27:36
What Freud did was to-- so if
we stick with this sort of

452
00:27:36 --> 00:27:40
metaphor land, dissociation
proposed that there was

453
00:27:40 --> 00:27:43
rebellion in the kingdom
of the self and that

454
00:27:43 --> 00:27:45
province's seceded.
 

455
00:27:45 --> 00:27:50
What Freud put up in place of
that was a dungeon in the

456
00:27:50 --> 00:27:54
castle of the self where
stuff was being imprisioned.

457
00:27:54 --> 00:27:57
It wasn't different from
you, but it was kept away

458
00:27:57 --> 00:28:01
from the conscious self.
 

459
00:28:01 --> 00:28:04
Now why did he come
up with this idea?

460
00:28:04 --> 00:28:07
To understand that you've got
to know a little bit about what

461
00:28:07 --> 00:28:11
Freud thought he was-- what
Freud was out trying to cure.

462
00:28:11 --> 00:28:16
His patients, a lot of his
patients came to him with

463
00:28:16 --> 00:28:19
hysterical symptoms.
 

464
00:28:19 --> 00:28:23
Hysteria, which we these days
sort use to talk about

465
00:28:23 --> 00:28:26
hysterical-- something that's
hysterical is very, very funny.

466
00:28:26 --> 00:28:30
That's a change in the meaning.
 

467
00:28:30 --> 00:28:37
A hysterical symptom was
a physical symptoms with

468
00:28:37 --> 00:28:39
no good organic cause.
 

469
00:28:39 --> 00:28:43
The classic Freudian or 19th
century hysterical symptom

470
00:28:43 --> 00:28:46
is something like a
glove anesthesia.

471
00:28:46 --> 00:28:50
A patient who comes to you
saying, Doc I can't feel

472
00:28:50 --> 00:28:52
anything in my hand.
 

473
00:28:52 --> 00:28:54
It's like I've got a glove
on to here, let's say.

474
00:28:54 --> 00:28:57
Everything above
this line is numb.

475
00:28:57 --> 00:29:03
Well, there is no lesion
that will do that.

476
00:29:03 --> 00:29:06
That if you cut nerves
you get very different

477
00:29:06 --> 00:29:08
patterns of numbness.
 

478
00:29:08 --> 00:29:12
You don't get this sort
of glove anesthesia.

479
00:29:12 --> 00:29:14
So in the absence of an
organic cause these are the

480
00:29:14 --> 00:29:17
things that got labeled
hysterical symptoms.

481
00:29:17 --> 00:29:23
They could be other things, a
cough with no good explanation.

482
00:29:23 --> 00:29:25
Even headaches with
no good expiration.

483
00:29:25 --> 00:29:29
Symptoms with no good organic
explanation were deemed

484
00:29:29 --> 00:29:30
to be hysterical.
 

485
00:29:30 --> 00:29:33
Anybody know where
the word comes from?

486
00:29:33 --> 00:29:35
The root of hysterical?
 

487
00:29:35 --> 00:29:37
AUDIENCE: The wandering uterus.
 

488
00:29:37 --> 00:29:39
PROFESSOR: Oh, we know
lots about this.

489
00:29:39 --> 00:29:43
Yeah, the root comes from
the word for uterus.

490
00:29:43 --> 00:29:47
And it was in fact a serious
discussion in the 19th century

491
00:29:47 --> 00:29:53
about whether men could be
hysterics because in case you

492
00:29:53 --> 00:29:57
were sleeping that week in high
school health men don't

493
00:29:57 --> 00:29:59
got uteruses right?
 

494
00:29:59 --> 00:30:01
Or uteri or whatever
the plural might be.

495
00:30:01 --> 00:30:07
 
 

496
00:30:07 --> 00:30:09
This is a very old idea.
 

497
00:30:09 --> 00:30:15
The old idea going back to
Egyptian writings was that the

498
00:30:15 --> 00:30:22
uterus could come loose and
wander around the body and

499
00:30:22 --> 00:30:25
produce weird symptoms, which
you can sort of imagine

500
00:30:25 --> 00:30:28
it would if this
actually happened.

501
00:30:28 --> 00:30:32
To my knowledge it doesn't
actually happen a lot.

502
00:30:32 --> 00:30:36
But there are a lot of terms in
the language that we still

503
00:30:36 --> 00:30:41
maintain by the way, that
echo the various ancient

504
00:30:41 --> 00:30:44
theories about psychology.
 

505
00:30:44 --> 00:30:47
I think I may have mentioned
the doctorine of the 4 humors.

506
00:30:47 --> 00:30:51
So somebody melancholic
was melancholy because he

507
00:30:51 --> 00:30:52
had too much black bile.
 

508
00:30:52 --> 00:30:57
You were sanguine because
you had excess blood.

509
00:30:57 --> 00:31:00
If you were phlegmatic
it's because you had

510
00:31:00 --> 00:31:02
too much phlegm.
 

511
00:31:02 --> 00:31:06
And if you were choleric it was
because you had too much yellow

512
00:31:06 --> 00:31:09
bile and the balance between
these-- it's rather like the

513
00:31:09 --> 00:31:13
big five in personality
theory-- that the balance of

514
00:31:13 --> 00:31:17
these big four humors was
mainstream European

515
00:31:17 --> 00:31:20
personality theory.
 

516
00:31:20 --> 00:31:25
I don't know, probably from
Rome up through 16th,

517
00:31:25 --> 00:31:29
17th century or so.
 

518
00:31:29 --> 00:31:33
And those words, to be
choleric, to be melancholy are

519
00:31:33 --> 00:31:40
still in the language and
reflect this older psychology.

520
00:31:40 --> 00:31:46
So Freud was there trying to
treat hysterical symptoms.

521
00:31:46 --> 00:31:50
He was by no means the first
person to try to do this

522
00:31:50 --> 00:31:53
because hysteria didn't
start with Freud.

523
00:31:53 --> 00:31:55
I mean, there were lots of
people running around.

524
00:31:55 --> 00:31:57
It was very popular in
the 19th century, these

525
00:31:57 --> 00:32:00
disorders and even before.
 

526
00:32:00 --> 00:32:04
 
 

527
00:32:04 --> 00:32:08
It's worth spending a
little time on at least

528
00:32:08 --> 00:32:10
one earlier effort.
 

529
00:32:10 --> 00:32:14
Actually, we will now pause
for the musical portion

530
00:32:14 --> 00:32:18
of today's lecture if the
CD player wants to work.

531
00:32:18 --> 00:32:20
 
 

532
00:32:20 --> 00:32:29
And let's see-- push the
button, play with the volume.

533
00:32:29 --> 00:32:30
I don't hear nothing.
 

534
00:32:30 --> 00:32:34
I hear very little.
 

535
00:32:34 --> 00:32:36
Play you silly machine.
 

536
00:32:36 --> 00:32:38
You don't want to play,
let's try this one.

537
00:32:38 --> 00:32:41
You play.
 

538
00:32:41 --> 00:32:41
That worked.

00:32:50 --> 00:32:52

involved a giant horseshoe

out to be important.

might be this giant

The boyfriend's aren't singing
because they're lying on the

ground here and that music
is nee-ee-ee-ee-ee.

oh they're twitching.

could tell of course.

that's the question.

I gave away part of

You know, I've played
this before and I

592
00:36:13 --> 00:36:14
asked, what was that?
 

593
00:36:14 --> 00:36:16
And somebody says, opera.
 

594
00:36:16 --> 00:36:17
I know that.
 

595
00:36:17 --> 00:36:20

596
00:36:20 --> 00:36:21
Yeah?

All right, you don't turn
out to be like a person one

00:36:29 --> 00:36:32
I thought that was pretty cool.
 

604
00:36:32 --> 00:36:36

00:36:52 --> 00:36:55
 
 

613
00:36:55 --> 00:36:59
And of course, the relevant
question here is, why?

614
00:36:59 --> 00:37:04
And for that I got to tell you
a little bit of the plot.

615
00:37:04 --> 00:37:11
So what's going on here, we'll
do this in good MIT terms.

616
00:37:11 --> 00:37:16
So we need some
equations I think.

617
00:37:16 --> 00:37:20
Or at least symbolic
representations of the plot.

618
00:37:20 --> 00:37:35
What we have is two
guys and two women and

619
00:37:35 --> 00:37:38
the X factor here.
 

620
00:37:38 --> 00:37:40
So they're together.
 

621
00:37:40 --> 00:37:44
They're in love, they
sing beautiful stuff.

622
00:37:44 --> 00:37:48
And their buddy comes
along and tells the guys,

623
00:37:48 --> 00:37:51
women are all fickle.
 

624
00:37:51 --> 00:37:53
The cosi fan tutte means
something like they're

625
00:37:53 --> 00:37:55
all like that.
 

626
00:37:55 --> 00:38:00
And you can't trust them
and the guys sing for

627
00:38:00 --> 00:38:01
another few hours.
 

628
00:38:01 --> 00:38:05
No, no our girlfriends are
good and true and stuff.

629
00:38:05 --> 00:38:06
So here's what we'll do.
 

630
00:38:06 --> 00:38:10
You guys pretend you've been
called up to go to war and then

631
00:38:10 --> 00:38:16
you sneak back into town
disguised as Albanian soldiers

632
00:38:16 --> 00:38:22
and we'll try the cross product
or something like that, right?

633
00:38:22 --> 00:38:26
 
 

634
00:38:26 --> 00:38:27
We'll see if we can
make this work.

635
00:38:27 --> 00:38:33
 
 

636
00:38:33 --> 00:38:38
And so a pile more singing
ensues and the girls are

637
00:38:38 --> 00:38:40
being very faithful.
 

638
00:38:40 --> 00:38:43
And so the guys decide
they're going to resort

639
00:38:43 --> 00:38:47
to desperate measures.
 

640
00:38:47 --> 00:38:49
Well, not terribly
desperate, semi-desperate.

641
00:38:49 --> 00:38:53
They'll fake taking poison
and because there's so

642
00:38:53 --> 00:38:53
much of [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

643
00:38:53 --> 00:38:54
take [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

644
00:38:54 --> 00:38:55
they're dead.
 

645
00:38:55 --> 00:38:59
And so the women are
very upset by this.

646
00:38:59 --> 00:39:04
And so they need to
cure these guys.

647
00:39:04 --> 00:39:09
Now there's a maid whose name
is Despina, so she can be D.

648
00:39:09 --> 00:39:13
 
 

649
00:39:13 --> 00:39:15
That's who you heard
singing as the doctor.

650
00:39:15 --> 00:39:17
She pretends to be a doctor.
 

651
00:39:17 --> 00:39:20
 
 

652
00:39:20 --> 00:39:24
It's a comic role rather than
a terribly tragic-- we've

653
00:39:24 --> 00:39:25
taken poison thing.
 

654
00:39:25 --> 00:39:31
And what she's doing is
attempting, she's claiming

655
00:39:31 --> 00:39:37
to cure them with Mesmer's
magic stone, which is

656
00:39:37 --> 00:39:39
basically a magnet.
 

657
00:39:39 --> 00:39:44
Now you've heard the
term mesmerize-- to

658
00:39:44 --> 00:39:46
mesmerize somebody.
 

659
00:39:46 --> 00:39:52
That actually comes from one
Franz Anton Mesmer who was

660
00:39:52 --> 00:39:55
working in Vienna and then
later in Paris at the

661
00:39:55 --> 00:39:56
same time as Mozart.
 

662
00:39:56 --> 00:40:00
In fact, he was a friend
of the Mozart families.

663
00:40:00 --> 00:40:04
And this was a time of a lot
of scientific advances in

664
00:40:04 --> 00:40:06
the study of magnetism.
 

665
00:40:06 --> 00:40:10
And Mesmer concluded that
there were magnetic

666
00:40:10 --> 00:40:11
forces everywhere.
 

667
00:40:11 --> 00:40:17
And the planets in particular,
had important magnetic forces

668
00:40:17 --> 00:40:21
and that these could be
channeled if you were

669
00:40:21 --> 00:40:25
an appropriately
receptive individual.

670
00:40:25 --> 00:40:27
You've heard of animal
magnetism, right?

671
00:40:27 --> 00:40:30
Well animal magnetism, a term
which has also lost its

672
00:40:30 --> 00:40:35
original meaning-- animal
magnetism, which today is sort

673
00:40:35 --> 00:40:39
of like I'm awash in musk,
or something like that.

674
00:40:39 --> 00:40:43
You know, I've got great
animal magnetism or whatever.

675
00:40:43 --> 00:40:47
It originally is Mesmer's term
for the notion that you could

676
00:40:47 --> 00:40:52
channel or specifically that he
could channel these magnetic

677
00:40:52 --> 00:40:55
forces of the heavens
and channel them for

678
00:40:55 --> 00:40:57
curative purposes.
 

679
00:40:57 --> 00:41:03
And he set himself up with a
clinic in Vienna and then

680
00:41:03 --> 00:41:05
in Paris to do just that.
 

681
00:41:05 --> 00:41:08
 
 

682
00:41:08 --> 00:41:12
It sounds like it must
have been quite a scene.

683
00:41:12 --> 00:41:14
If you went to Mesmer's--
Mesmer would have liked this

684
00:41:14 --> 00:41:18
room actually because he was
in to purple, apparently

685
00:41:18 --> 00:41:19
from what I read.
 

686
00:41:19 --> 00:41:22
But in any case, you'd come
into Mesmer's sort of waiting

687
00:41:22 --> 00:41:32
room and there would be a
string band playing quiet music

688
00:41:32 --> 00:41:35
on magnetized instruments.
 

689
00:41:35 --> 00:41:40
And a tub often, in some
of his establishments.

690
00:41:40 --> 00:41:45
A big tub filled with
magnetized water and people

691
00:41:45 --> 00:41:50
could sit in the tub or there
were sort of like metal rods

692
00:41:50 --> 00:41:56
coming out of the tub that you
would poke into the part of

693
00:41:56 --> 00:42:00
your body that was afflicted.
 

694
00:42:00 --> 00:42:03
But this was all
sort of warm up.

695
00:42:03 --> 00:42:07
The critical piece was when
Mesmer himself would sweep in--

696
00:42:07 --> 00:42:09
from all the descriptions--
like something out of Harry

697
00:42:09 --> 00:42:15
Potter in flowing purple
robes with a purple hat on.

698
00:42:15 --> 00:42:20
Extremely charismatic guy to
all appearances and then what

699
00:42:20 --> 00:42:25
he would do is he'd come in and
lay-- in fear you'll forgive

700
00:42:25 --> 00:42:30
me-- lay hands on you and you
having bought into this general

701
00:42:30 --> 00:42:37
notion and rather like this
notion that you would know what

702
00:42:37 --> 00:42:40
the options are for going
insane you would also know that

703
00:42:40 --> 00:42:45
your job here was to have a
seizure and to lose

704
00:42:45 --> 00:42:46
consciousness.
 

705
00:42:46 --> 00:42:50
So you don't need to
do that, it's OK.

706
00:42:50 --> 00:42:52
You'd then be carried off to
another room where you would

707
00:42:52 --> 00:42:57
recover and with luck, your
symptoms would be ameliorated.

708
00:42:57 --> 00:43:01
Now what Mesmer had discovered
or rediscovered since the

709
00:43:01 --> 00:43:05
various forms of it over
history was hypnosis.

710
00:43:05 --> 00:43:10
To mesmerize and to hypnotize
have all a similar kind of

711
00:43:10 --> 00:43:18
meaning to them, particularly
in the earlier literature and

712
00:43:18 --> 00:43:22
it probably didn't do much for
the people who came to him with

713
00:43:22 --> 00:43:26
cancer and various other things
that 18th Century science

714
00:43:26 --> 00:43:27
couldn't do anything about.
 

715
00:43:27 --> 00:43:30
But the people who came to him
with hysterical symptoms

716
00:43:30 --> 00:43:33
apparently got some
degree of relief.

717
00:43:33 --> 00:43:37
Now hypnosis fell
into disfavor.

718
00:43:37 --> 00:43:43
In part because he was a bit
of an act and the Paris

719
00:43:43 --> 00:43:45
scientific establishment
was very dubious of him.

720
00:43:45 --> 00:43:48
They put together a panel
to investigate him.

721
00:43:48 --> 00:43:50
The panel is an interesting
one in its own right.

722
00:43:50 --> 00:43:54
Its members included
Benjamin Franklin then

723
00:43:54 --> 00:43:58
U.S. Ambassador to Paris.
 

724
00:43:58 --> 00:44:05
The chemist Levousier and one
Dr. Guillotine, later famous

725
00:44:05 --> 00:44:07
for a different invention.
 

726
00:44:07 --> 00:44:10
 
 

727
00:44:10 --> 00:44:12
But they concluded that
he was a quack and

728
00:44:12 --> 00:44:15
he died in disgrace.
 

729
00:44:15 --> 00:44:17
And hypnosis has come
in and out of fashion.

730
00:44:17 --> 00:44:20
As we talked about in the
context of multiple personality

731
00:44:20 --> 00:44:26
disorder it's considered an
important tool for some

732
00:44:26 --> 00:44:28
therapists today.
 

733
00:44:28 --> 00:44:32
In the late 19th Century it
was revived, again, in Paris.

734
00:44:32 --> 00:44:37
Particularly, by a
psychiatrist named Charcot.

735
00:44:37 --> 00:44:40
 
 

736
00:44:40 --> 00:44:44
Charcot was at the
leading French Parisian

737
00:44:44 --> 00:44:45
mental institution.
 

738
00:44:45 --> 00:44:50
Had some very disturbed
patients and was working to

739
00:44:50 --> 00:44:57
treat them with hypnosis by
inducing symptoms in them and

740
00:44:57 --> 00:45:00
then suggesting-- well,
basically putting them under

741
00:45:00 --> 00:45:03
hypnosis and telling
them how to be.

742
00:45:03 --> 00:45:08
It was essentially manipulating
a passive kind of a patient.

743
00:45:08 --> 00:45:10
Now Freud was in
Vienna at the time.

744
00:45:10 --> 00:45:13
Came to Paris to study with
Charcot because Freud

745
00:45:13 --> 00:45:15
wasn't sure what to
do with his patients.

746
00:45:15 --> 00:45:18
Let me tell you about
one of his patients.

747
00:45:18 --> 00:45:22
Known in the
literature as Anna O.

748
00:45:22 --> 00:45:25
And she's known in the
literature as Anna O.

749
00:45:25 --> 00:45:28
because when Freud wrote about
her he attempted to preserve

750
00:45:28 --> 00:45:32
her privacy by giving
her a pseudonym.

751
00:45:32 --> 00:45:34
Her real name is
Bertha Pappenheim.

752
00:45:34 --> 00:45:38
I'm not actually violating
patient confidentiality here,

753
00:45:38 --> 00:45:42
like almost every important
patient Freud ever had,

754
00:45:42 --> 00:45:44
she wrote a memoir.
 

755
00:45:44 --> 00:45:46
You can spend your life
reading the memoirs

756
00:45:46 --> 00:45:47
of Freud's patients.
 

757
00:45:47 --> 00:45:51
Anyway, she was Bertha
Pappenheim, but known in

758
00:45:51 --> 00:45:53
the literature as Anna O.
 

759
00:45:53 --> 00:45:57
She was a grab bag of
hysterical symptoms

760
00:45:57 --> 00:46:03
precipitated most immediately
by the crisis of attending her

761
00:46:03 --> 00:46:07
father through his
final illness.

762
00:46:07 --> 00:46:10
And she was actually being
treated originally not by Freud

763
00:46:10 --> 00:46:15
but by Freud's colleague, Josef
Breuer whose name I think

764
00:46:15 --> 00:46:17
I put on the handout.
 

765
00:46:17 --> 00:46:20
Yes, there we go.
 

766
00:46:20 --> 00:46:22
And they took to using
hypnosis, but they took to

767
00:46:22 --> 00:46:24
using hypnosis in the new way.
 

768
00:46:24 --> 00:46:28
Rather than using it to
manipulate the patient or to

769
00:46:28 --> 00:46:31
cause a seizure or something
like that they used it in the

770
00:46:31 --> 00:46:35
context of what Anna herself
called a talking cure.

771
00:46:35 --> 00:46:38
They talked to her.
 

772
00:46:38 --> 00:46:46
Under hypnosis she seemed to be
able to recover memories that

773
00:46:46 --> 00:46:50
she could not reach otherwise.
 

774
00:46:50 --> 00:46:53
That these memories were
often accompanied by violent

775
00:46:53 --> 00:46:55
emotional reactions.
 

776
00:46:55 --> 00:47:01
And that this emotional
eruption had an effect

777
00:47:01 --> 00:47:04
of purging the symptom.
 

778
00:47:04 --> 00:47:10
Borrowing a term from Greek
tragedy, Freud called

779
00:47:10 --> 00:47:12
this catharsis.
 

780
00:47:12 --> 00:47:15
Borrowing a term from the
neighbors or something, Anna O.

781
00:47:15 --> 00:47:18
called this chimney sweeping.
 

782
00:47:18 --> 00:47:22
 
 

783
00:47:22 --> 00:47:26
The difficulty was that it
seemed in her case to be

784
00:47:26 --> 00:47:27
rather temporary business.
 

785
00:47:27 --> 00:47:30
In fact, Freud abandoned
hypnosis eventually

786
00:47:30 --> 00:47:31
because of this problem.
 

787
00:47:31 --> 00:47:35
That hypnosis seemed to be
useful for treating symptoms,

788
00:47:35 --> 00:47:38
but somehow not getting at
whatever the underlying cause

789
00:47:38 --> 00:47:46
was because she'd go away, her
symptom cured and then

790
00:47:46 --> 00:47:48
something else would pop up and
she'd be back for

791
00:47:48 --> 00:47:51
another round.
 

792
00:47:51 --> 00:47:57
Now the reason we know about
Freud and not Breuer is that

793
00:47:57 --> 00:48:00
Breuer ended up running away
from this and Freud ended

794
00:48:00 --> 00:48:03
up jumping into it.
 

795
00:48:03 --> 00:48:10
What Breuer ran away from was
Anna coming back with a new

796
00:48:10 --> 00:48:15
symptom and this new symptom
was a hysterical pregnancy.

797
00:48:15 --> 00:48:17
Which is to say, she
thought she was pregnant.

798
00:48:17 --> 00:48:21
She was convinced she was
pregnant and she was convinced

799
00:48:21 --> 00:48:24
Breuer was the father.
 

800
00:48:24 --> 00:48:29
Now there's no particular
evidence that Breuer was

801
00:48:29 --> 00:48:33
sexually involved with her at
all, but you've got to imagine

802
00:48:33 --> 00:48:41
being a psychiatrist with a
practice with young women, you

803
00:48:41 --> 00:48:45
know what's it going to do to
your reputation if one of these

804
00:48:45 --> 00:48:50
young women even mistakenly
thinks she's pregnant?

805
00:48:50 --> 00:48:52
Doesn't matter that
she's not pregnant.

806
00:48:52 --> 00:48:55
Matters that she thinks she
knows how she got pregnant

807
00:48:55 --> 00:48:58
and that's just trouble.
 

808
00:48:58 --> 00:49:01
And he said, I can't
see you anymore.

809
00:49:01 --> 00:49:05
But Freud on the other hand, I
believe actually continued to

810
00:49:05 --> 00:49:09
treat her, but more to the
point, what Freud became

811
00:49:09 --> 00:49:13
interested in were the more
fundamental questions like

812
00:49:13 --> 00:49:19
look, if there really are these
memories here somewhere that

813
00:49:19 --> 00:49:24
we're only getting to by this
hypnotic technique in this

814
00:49:24 --> 00:49:29
particular case, where
are those memories?

815
00:49:29 --> 00:49:33
And why do they only come
out when we're doing this

816
00:49:33 --> 00:49:36
psychotherapy with her?
 

817
00:49:36 --> 00:49:38
Why are they hidden?
 

818
00:49:38 --> 00:49:42
And what's their connection
with the symptoms?

819
00:49:42 --> 00:49:45
 
 

820
00:49:45 --> 00:49:47
Those were the questions
that he really wanted

821
00:49:47 --> 00:49:48
to know the answer to.
 

822
00:49:48 --> 00:49:52
He wanted to be able to treat
patients too, but this was the

823
00:49:52 --> 00:49:55
sort of underlying interesting,
scientific questions that

824
00:49:55 --> 00:49:58
he wanted to get to.
 

825
00:49:58 --> 00:50:01
And he came to the conclusion
that there was something that

826
00:50:01 --> 00:50:04
was actively interfering
with these memories.

827
00:50:04 --> 00:50:10
It wasn't just like you can't
remember the answer to some

828
00:50:10 --> 00:50:13
multiple choice question on the
final because you're just

829
00:50:13 --> 00:50:15
having a retrieval problem.
 

830
00:50:15 --> 00:50:18
He thought that in these cases
there was something that was

831
00:50:18 --> 00:50:25
actively fighting against you
remembering anything, and he

832
00:50:25 --> 00:50:28
wanted to know what
that might be.

833
00:50:28 --> 00:50:31
 
 

834
00:50:31 --> 00:50:37
The heart of his depth
psychology was the idea that

835
00:50:37 --> 00:50:40
these thoughts that they were
dredging up were thoughts that

836
00:50:40 --> 00:50:45
had been locked away in
the Freudian unconscious.

837
00:50:45 --> 00:50:48
Different, if you like, from
the cognitive unconscious

838
00:50:48 --> 00:50:49
from earlier in the term.
 

839
00:50:49 --> 00:50:52
These things had been
deliberately locked away

840
00:50:52 --> 00:50:58
down here and kept away
from consciousness.

841
00:50:58 --> 00:51:00
He didn't invent the idea
of the unconscious.

842
00:51:00 --> 00:51:02
It existed as sort of a
literary metaphor in

843
00:51:02 --> 00:51:06
19th century European
writings, for instance.

844
00:51:06 --> 00:51:12
But he gave it a place in
a theory of the mind.

845
00:51:12 --> 00:51:15
 
 

846
00:51:15 --> 00:51:24
And he had an explanation for
why it was populated with these

847
00:51:24 --> 00:51:27
thoughts that were somehow
hidden from the user.

848
00:51:27 --> 00:51:31
I'll tell you about
that at 3 o'clock.

849
00:51:31 --> 00:51:51
 
 

850
00:51:51 --> 00:51:54
AUDIENCE: If, like you said,
if most of the psychology

851
00:51:54 --> 00:51:58
functions on Freud was wrong,
then why are psychologists and

852
00:51:58 --> 00:52:03
scientists still so obsessed
with proving that he was wrong?

853
00:52:03 --> 00:52:09
 
 

854
00:52:09 --> 00:52:12
PROFESSOR: I think most
would answer, they're not.

855
00:52:12 --> 00:52:13
That at this point
it's a done deal.

856
00:52:13 --> 00:52:16
 
 

857
00:52:16 --> 00:52:20
But to the extent that they
are-- no, to the extent that

858
00:52:20 --> 00:52:28
they are it's because Freud is
still, you go out on the street

859
00:52:28 --> 00:52:33
and ask people, tell me the
first ten things that come to

860
00:52:33 --> 00:52:35
your mind if I say psychology.
 

861
00:52:35 --> 00:52:37
One of them is going to be
Freud and two others will be

862
00:52:37 --> 00:52:39
terms that have something
to do with Freud.

863
00:52:39 --> 00:52:44
And if you think that that's
all hooey it's going to drive

864
00:52:44 --> 00:52:47
you nuts and if this is your
own particular area you're

865
00:52:47 --> 00:52:53
going to work to kill
it off, I suppose.

866
00:52:53 --> 00:52:55
AUDIENCE: Because when I was
writing my paper and I was

867
00:52:55 --> 00:53:00
reading all these books about
sex and sexual orientation and

868
00:53:00 --> 00:53:03
how it comes to be developed--
like half the books were

869
00:53:03 --> 00:53:06
like well, Freud is wrong.
 

870
00:53:06 --> 00:53:07
PROFESSOR: That'll depend a
little on how old the books

871
00:53:07 --> 00:53:12
were that you were-- but Freud
was actually, if you're talking

872
00:53:12 --> 00:53:16
about sexual orientation, Freud
was actually more interesting

873
00:53:16 --> 00:53:18
than his followers.
 

874
00:53:18 --> 00:53:25
Freud regarded homosexuality
as not as a biological issue,

875
00:53:25 --> 00:53:29
but as a developmental issue.
 

876
00:53:29 --> 00:53:32
But did not think that
it was abnormal.

877
00:53:32 --> 00:53:35
He thought it was a variance.
 

878
00:53:35 --> 00:53:41
There's a famous letter written
to the mother of a gay man

879
00:53:41 --> 00:53:47
where he says basically, it's
not the mainline path, but

880
00:53:47 --> 00:53:48
don't worry about it.
 

881
00:53:48 --> 00:53:52
It's just one of the ways
that things work out.

882
00:53:52 --> 00:53:56
The American psychological
establishment then declared it

883
00:53:56 --> 00:53:59
to be a disorder and only in
the '70s declared

884
00:53:59 --> 00:54:02
that it was not.
 

885
00:54:02 --> 00:54:06
But Freud in that sense was--
well, assuming that we are

886
00:54:06 --> 00:54:10
right at this point, that it is
biological in its roots he was

887
00:54:10 --> 00:54:16
wrong, but he would have been
cool about that, I think.

888
00:54:16 --> 00:54:20
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about hypnosis.

889
00:54:20 --> 00:54:22
Is it true that they can't
make you do something that

890
00:54:22 --> 00:54:25
you don't want to do?
 

891
00:54:25 --> 00:54:27
PROFESSOR: I would lecture
about that a bit, but I'd run

892
00:54:27 --> 00:54:30
out of-- my hunch is that
it's not really true.

893
00:54:30 --> 00:54:36
 
 

894
00:54:36 --> 00:54:39
I think that it's a little
like this Mesmer thing.

895
00:54:39 --> 00:54:41
That we have a set of things
that we believe about

896
00:54:41 --> 00:54:42
what hypnosis does.
 

897
00:54:42 --> 00:54:45
It can make me behave like a
child, it can make me behave

898
00:54:45 --> 00:54:50
like a chicken, it can't
make me murder you.

899
00:54:50 --> 00:54:52
I don't know of any clear
evidence, one way or

900
00:54:52 --> 00:54:56
the other on that.
 

901
00:54:56 --> 00:55:01
I mean, it's not complete
sucession of the will in some

902
00:55:01 --> 00:55:04
sense, so there is some chunk
of you saying, I'm

903
00:55:04 --> 00:55:06
not going do that.
 

904
00:55:06 --> 00:55:10
But could you make somebody
do something modestly wrong?

905
00:55:10 --> 00:55:12
I bet you could.
 

906
00:55:12 --> 00:55:14
But anyway, very
interesting topic.

907
00:55:14 --> 00:55:23
 
 

908
00:55:23 --> 00:55:27
Freud's understanding about
what was going on or what was

909
00:55:27 --> 00:55:33
stuffed away down here in the
dungeon of the unconscious

910
00:55:33 --> 00:55:36
starts with Freud's
understanding of what it

911
00:55:36 --> 00:55:41
means to be a baby.
 

912
00:55:41 --> 00:55:44
He thought that babies
came into the world

913
00:55:44 --> 00:55:46
as amoral creatures.
 

914
00:55:46 --> 00:55:49
 
 

915
00:55:49 --> 00:55:52
Certainly his contemporaries at
the time tended to

916
00:55:52 --> 00:55:56
misunderstand this to mean that
he meant that babies

917
00:55:56 --> 00:55:58
were immoral.
 

918
00:55:58 --> 00:55:59
That wasn't what he meant.
 

919
00:55:59 --> 00:56:06
What he was really doing, had
he taken my version of intro

920
00:56:06 --> 00:56:12
psych he probably would have
drawn one of those little

921
00:56:12 --> 00:56:16
developmental pictures that I
was drawing when we were doing

922
00:56:16 --> 00:56:20
development and said, well
look, here's units of

923
00:56:20 --> 00:56:22
moralness or something.
 

924
00:56:22 --> 00:56:25
Here's time.
 

925
00:56:25 --> 00:56:30
Here's the adult state and
I, Freud, am asserting

926
00:56:30 --> 00:56:33
that babies-- that the
starting place is here.

927
00:56:33 --> 00:56:36
And that there's some function
that gets you up to the

928
00:56:36 --> 00:56:40
adult state and isn't
that interesting.

929
00:56:40 --> 00:56:47
The naive, probably Victorian
Era notion was probably

930
00:56:47 --> 00:56:50
something more like
babies start here.

931
00:56:50 --> 00:56:55
They are pure, they have little
wings and only when they grow

932
00:56:55 --> 00:57:00
up do they become sinful,
nasty things like you and me.

933
00:57:00 --> 00:57:06
And so this notion of babies as
amoral agents was not something

934
00:57:06 --> 00:57:10
that his contemporaries
were really thrilled with.

935
00:57:10 --> 00:57:12
Freud was probably wrong
about this, right?

936
00:57:12 --> 00:57:17
We've already seen that babies
seem to have some rudiments of

937
00:57:17 --> 00:57:21
something like empathy, so all
right, let's start them there.

938
00:57:21 --> 00:57:25
But the larger point-- that
babies do not come into the

939
00:57:25 --> 00:57:32
world with anything like adult
moral reasoning is an

940
00:57:32 --> 00:57:36
interesting one because you've
got to imagine as Freud did,

941
00:57:36 --> 00:57:41
what's going on in the
little kid's brain.

942
00:57:41 --> 00:57:43
Sorry, little kid's mind.
 

943
00:57:43 --> 00:57:47
So here you are, your little
amoral baby, let's give that to

944
00:57:47 --> 00:57:52
Freud for the time being and I
don't know, a year later

945
00:57:52 --> 00:57:54
there's a new baby.
 

946
00:57:54 --> 00:57:56
 
 

947
00:57:56 --> 00:57:59
New baby wants stuff.
 

948
00:57:59 --> 00:58:02
Wants stuff that you used
to get all the time,

949
00:58:02 --> 00:58:05
like Mom, for instance.
 

950
00:58:05 --> 00:58:12
So you're amoral, there's a
baby, what do you want to do?

951
00:58:12 --> 00:58:14
AUDIENCE: Get rid of the baby.
 

952
00:58:14 --> 00:58:15
PROFESSOR: Get rid of the baby.
 

953
00:58:15 --> 00:58:17
Well, how we going to do that?
 

954
00:58:17 --> 00:58:18
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

955
00:58:18 --> 00:58:20
PROFESSOR: Eat it,
that might be good.

956
00:58:20 --> 00:58:22
 
 

957
00:58:22 --> 00:58:25
We'll kill it in some fashion,
the details aren't terribly

958
00:58:25 --> 00:58:27
important if you're
a one year-old.

959
00:58:27 --> 00:58:29
Let's just kill it.
 

960
00:58:29 --> 00:58:32
The nice thing is it's not easy
for you to do that so that your

961
00:58:32 --> 00:58:35
little brother grows up anyway.
 

962
00:58:35 --> 00:58:40
You know, there's lots of
things like that in your life

963
00:58:40 --> 00:58:48
where not a late little
baby brother, but like Dad.

964
00:58:48 --> 00:58:49
Dad's a problem.
 

965
00:58:49 --> 00:58:54
Man, he comes home and I've
spent all day with Mom and

966
00:58:54 --> 00:58:57
Mom's been nice and everything
and then Dad comes home

967
00:58:57 --> 00:58:59
and Mom's ignoring me.
 

968
00:58:59 --> 00:59:02
Let's kill Dad.
 

969
00:59:02 --> 00:59:05
And let's take Mom all for
ourselves, stuff like that.

970
00:59:05 --> 00:59:09
 
 

971
00:59:09 --> 00:59:12
So what's driving the baby?
 

972
00:59:12 --> 00:59:16
Freud proposed that what's
driving infants and young

973
00:59:16 --> 00:59:18
children is what he called
the pleasure principle.

974
00:59:18 --> 00:59:21
Doesn't take an awful
lot to decode that.

975
00:59:21 --> 00:59:23
Freud thought, baby wants
pleasure, baby wants

976
00:59:23 --> 00:59:27
it now, right?
 

977
00:59:27 --> 00:59:31
But look, you're going to work
your way up, if you end up as

978
00:59:31 --> 00:59:36
an adult in that state you are
a psychologically

979
00:59:36 --> 00:59:37
deformed adult.
 

980
00:59:37 --> 00:59:39
An amoral adult is
a real problem.

981
00:59:39 --> 00:59:42
An adult who's governed
entirely by something like

982
00:59:42 --> 00:59:43
the pleasure principle
is a real problem.

983
00:59:43 --> 00:59:44
It's not going to work.
 

984
00:59:44 --> 00:59:49
So you're working your way up
there and you've got to imagine

985
00:59:49 --> 00:59:53
someday you wake up and you've
moved to the next moral

986
00:59:53 --> 00:59:55
level in some fashion.
 

987
00:59:55 --> 00:59:59
Now how do you
know who you are?

988
00:59:59 --> 01:00:02
Well, you ask yourself, what
kind of a person am I?

989
01:00:02 --> 01:00:06
And you go and examine this
stuff and you say, I'm a

990
01:00:06 --> 01:00:09
good, honest, loving person
except for that time.

991
01:00:09 --> 01:00:11
 
 

992
01:00:11 --> 01:00:15
All right, so you wake up, you
look in your head and ask,

993
01:00:15 --> 01:00:17
what kind of a person am I?
 

994
01:00:17 --> 01:00:22
And you go rummaging around and
you say, kill little brother.

995
01:00:22 --> 01:00:24
Kill Daddy.
 

996
01:00:24 --> 01:00:28
Hurt Daddy, grab Mommy.
 

997
01:00:28 --> 01:00:31
Hurt mommy because Mommy didn't
like to be gra-- wait a second.

998
01:00:31 --> 01:00:34
I don't like this.
 

999
01:00:34 --> 01:00:38
This is not a me that
I can live with.

1000
01:00:38 --> 01:00:41
A me who is-- look,
or imagine this.

1001
01:00:41 --> 01:00:46
Suppose you woke up tomorrow
with your head full of

1002
01:00:46 --> 01:00:52
thoughts that said, I'm
going to kill my roommate.

1003
01:00:52 --> 01:00:54
This is how I'm going to do it.
 

1004
01:00:54 --> 01:00:57
I've been thinking
about this through.

1005
01:00:57 --> 01:01:02
If I'm describing you, by the
way well, we should talk.

1006
01:01:02 --> 01:01:06
 
 

1007
01:01:06 --> 01:01:13
But you would be deeply
disturbed if you had what felt

1008
01:01:13 --> 01:01:20
to you like an obsessive set of
thoughts about going off and

1009
01:01:20 --> 01:01:21
doing harm to somebody.
 

1010
01:01:21 --> 01:01:25
Or sexual thoughts.
 

1011
01:01:25 --> 01:01:30
Every time your mind is
completely filled with thoughts

1012
01:01:30 --> 01:01:36
about doing something with
somebody and it's for some

1013
01:01:36 --> 01:01:39
reason either inappropriate,
unlikely, or whatever.

1014
01:01:39 --> 01:01:42
If you got a brain full of
thoughts like that, it's going

1015
01:01:42 --> 01:01:45
to be disturbing and Freud
figured that that's basically

1016
01:01:45 --> 01:01:47
what happened as
kids got older.

1017
01:01:47 --> 01:01:51
They found that they had a
mind full of these infantile

1018
01:01:51 --> 01:01:54
thoughts that were simply
unacceptable and they

1019
01:01:54 --> 01:01:56
stuffed them down here.
 

1020
01:01:56 --> 01:01:57
That's Freudian repression.
 

1021
01:01:57 --> 01:02:00
They repressed these thoughts.
 

1022
01:02:00 --> 01:02:03
Now that seems stupid.
 

1023
01:02:03 --> 01:02:04
Why do that?
 

1024
01:02:04 --> 01:02:07
Why don't we just
get rid of them?

1025
01:02:07 --> 01:02:11
Well, you have only rather
limited abilities to actually

1026
01:02:11 --> 01:02:16
deliberately forget stuff-- as
you've probably discovered

1027
01:02:16 --> 01:02:18
at various emotional
times in your life.

1028
01:02:18 --> 01:02:21
You know, you break up with
somebody and you think, I'm

1029
01:02:21 --> 01:02:25
just going to wash that man
right out of my hair or

1030
01:02:25 --> 01:02:26
something like that.
 

1031
01:02:26 --> 01:02:29
It turns out to not
be quite that easy.

1032
01:02:29 --> 01:02:36
And there are probably good
reasons for that like waking

1033
01:02:36 --> 01:02:41
up-- well, not waking -- going
to class, getting back the

1034
01:02:41 --> 01:02:48
calculus test with the score
on it in single digits and

1035
01:02:48 --> 01:02:52
thinking, oh man, I hate this.
 

1036
01:02:52 --> 01:02:56
I wish I could just forget
calculus completely.

1037
01:02:56 --> 01:02:59
Oh man.
 

1038
01:02:59 --> 01:03:01
No, it wouldn't be
good if that worked.

1039
01:03:01 --> 01:03:04
That's why your computer
asks you, do you want to

1040
01:03:04 --> 01:03:07
erase your disk drive?
 

1041
01:03:07 --> 01:03:11
And your version of this is to
simply not have that ability in

1042
01:03:11 --> 01:03:14
any very comprehensive fashion.
 

1043
01:03:14 --> 01:03:15
So you don't have the
option of just getting

1044
01:03:15 --> 01:03:17
rid of these thoughts.
 

1045
01:03:17 --> 01:03:20
They're there, so you
stuff them down here.

1046
01:03:20 --> 01:03:23
Now an important piece
of this is that what

1047
01:03:23 --> 01:03:27
Freud is describing is
his view of normal.

1048
01:03:27 --> 01:03:30
 
 

1049
01:03:30 --> 01:03:35
Again, Freudian jargon that we
tend to use out on the street,

1050
01:03:35 --> 01:03:39
you say somebody-- oh,
he's so repressed.

1051
01:03:39 --> 01:03:42
Sounding like that's wrong.
 

1052
01:03:42 --> 01:03:46
Freud thought that this sort
of repression was absolutely

1053
01:03:46 --> 01:03:53
required for adult
psychological human life.

1054
01:03:53 --> 01:03:56
You know, maybe not if
you're a chimp or something

1055
01:03:56 --> 01:03:57
like that, or a gorilla.
 

1056
01:03:57 --> 01:04:00
But if you were going to be a
human, you were going to need

1057
01:04:00 --> 01:04:08
to repress this stuff because--
the patients he was seeing in

1058
01:04:08 --> 01:04:11
his vew were patients where
this had gone bad in some

1059
01:04:11 --> 01:04:13
fashion, where it wasn't
working for them.

1060
01:04:13 --> 01:04:16
But all of us, in Freud's
view are built like this.

1061
01:04:16 --> 01:04:19
And all of us have an
unconscious that's filled with

1062
01:04:19 --> 01:04:23
these unacceptable thoughts and
all of those unacceptable

1063
01:04:23 --> 01:04:26
thoughts, there is no capital
punishment down here.

1064
01:04:26 --> 01:04:29
You may be able to forget
everything that I taught you in

1065
01:04:29 --> 01:04:32
psychology, but it turns out --
according to Freud-- that

1066
01:04:32 --> 01:04:33
you're not forgetting
any of this stuff.

1067
01:04:33 --> 01:04:37
It's there and it's like a
collection of prisoners who are

1068
01:04:37 --> 01:04:38
trying to make a break for it.
 

1069
01:04:38 --> 01:04:41
They always want out.
 

1070
01:04:41 --> 01:04:46
So if you, the king, got this
jail full of characters who

1071
01:04:46 --> 01:04:49
want to get out and trash the
castle, you'd better have

1072
01:04:49 --> 01:04:53
guards and the defense
mechanisms like projection that

1073
01:04:53 --> 01:05:01
I talked about before are the
guards who are there to keep

1074
01:05:01 --> 01:05:09
the repressed material
repressed or to channel its

1075
01:05:09 --> 01:05:13
energies in ways that
are harmless to you.

1076
01:05:13 --> 01:05:21
To avoid exposing to you
the stuff that would

1077
01:05:21 --> 01:05:23
be unacceptable.
 

1078
01:05:23 --> 01:05:26
So this stuff, the sitting
here protesting, how does it

1079
01:05:26 --> 01:05:27
make a break for freedom?
 

1080
01:05:27 --> 01:05:31
Typically, by association with
something in the outside

1081
01:05:31 --> 01:05:34
conscious kind of world.
 

1082
01:05:34 --> 01:05:39
So you know, you wanted to kill
off your little brother and now

1083
01:05:39 --> 01:05:50
you're playing football and--
I'm making this up-- and

1084
01:05:50 --> 01:05:55
there's a little guy playing
football and some chunk of all

1085
01:05:55 --> 01:05:58
of this says, association time.
 

1086
01:05:58 --> 01:05:59
Association time.
 

1087
01:05:59 --> 01:06:01
Reminds me of little brother.
 

1088
01:06:01 --> 01:06:01
Let's kill it.
 

1089
01:06:01 --> 01:06:04
Let's kill it.
 

1090
01:06:04 --> 01:06:07
A little bit of that channeled
-- when you channel it into

1091
01:06:07 --> 01:06:11
sport it's called sublimation
in Freudian terms.

1092
01:06:11 --> 01:06:13
But you know, that's OK.
 

1093
01:06:13 --> 01:06:15
Good, hard tackle or something.
 

1094
01:06:15 --> 01:06:18
If you actually then pound him
into a pulp that's less good

1095
01:06:18 --> 01:06:23
and you've got mechanisms there
to keep you from doing that

1096
01:06:23 --> 01:06:25
and to keep you from ever
recognizing any sort of

1097
01:06:25 --> 01:06:32
association with any of these
sort of infantile thoughts.

1098
01:06:32 --> 01:06:34
So I already mentioned
projection as one

1099
01:06:34 --> 01:06:36
of these devices.
 

1100
01:06:36 --> 01:06:41
You are angry at your brother
and you conclude that your

1101
01:06:41 --> 01:06:45
brother is angry at you.
 

1102
01:06:45 --> 01:06:46
There are a bunch of them.
 

1103
01:06:46 --> 01:06:47
They're talked
about in the book.

1104
01:06:47 --> 01:06:51
A bunch of them are rather
straightforward in the sense

1105
01:06:51 --> 01:06:55
that the term defines itself.
 

1106
01:06:55 --> 01:07:00
Denial, simply saying,
no, I don't think that.

1107
01:07:00 --> 01:07:02
I don't hate him, not me.
 

1108
01:07:02 --> 01:07:06
Or that rationalization.
 

1109
01:07:06 --> 01:07:14
The great rationalization in my
family is a canon of stories.

1110
01:07:14 --> 01:07:20
I have twin sisters and one of
them reported to my mother that

1111
01:07:20 --> 01:07:23
she had pushed the other
one down the stairs on

1112
01:07:23 --> 01:07:27
purpose by mistake.
 

1113
01:07:27 --> 01:07:30
The nice thing about little
kids is sometimes-- you can

1114
01:07:30 --> 01:07:32
sort of understand where Freud
was coming from if you watch

1115
01:07:32 --> 01:07:36
little kids because sometimes
the mechanisms that Freud's

1116
01:07:36 --> 01:07:40
talking about are more
transparently visible.

1117
01:07:40 --> 01:07:45
So there she is giving some
sort of an account, a

1118
01:07:45 --> 01:07:50
rationalization of this act
that she doesn't want-- not

1119
01:07:50 --> 01:07:52
that a little kid is going to
say look, I really pushed my

1120
01:07:52 --> 01:07:54
sister down the stairs because
I have these deep infantile,

1121
01:07:54 --> 01:07:57
hostile, intents towards her.
 

1122
01:07:57 --> 01:07:58
I'm really tired of having
a twin sister and I was

1123
01:07:58 --> 01:08:01
trying to kill her.
 

1124
01:08:01 --> 01:08:04
That wouldn't be something
that fortunately, my

1125
01:08:04 --> 01:08:08
sister would say.
 

1126
01:08:08 --> 01:08:15
Another example where you can
see this in action in little

1127
01:08:15 --> 01:08:17
kids, you can sort of see where
Freud was coming from, is the

1128
01:08:17 --> 01:08:21
defense mechanism that he
called-- maybe it's his

1129
01:08:21 --> 01:08:22
daughter who actually
named it-- but it's

1130
01:08:22 --> 01:08:24
reaction formation.
 

1131
01:08:24 --> 01:08:28
Reaction formation, it's easy
to confuse with projection.

1132
01:08:28 --> 01:08:36
Projection is you know, I hate
you is the truth and you hate

1133
01:08:36 --> 01:08:39
me is the result of the
projection defense mechanism.

1134
01:08:39 --> 01:08:41
I decide that you hate me.
 

1135
01:08:41 --> 01:08:45
In reaction formation the
flipping is a little different.

1136
01:08:45 --> 01:08:49
I hate you, but I decide
I really love you.

1137
01:08:49 --> 01:08:53
You flip the emotional around
to an acceptable emotion.

1138
01:08:53 --> 01:08:56
And the place to see this
best-- how many of you

1139
01:08:56 --> 01:08:59
have younger siblings?
 

1140
01:08:59 --> 01:09:04
Can any of you remember an
occasion where you were

1141
01:09:04 --> 01:09:11
told to stop hugging your
little siblings so hard?

1142
01:09:11 --> 01:09:12
No, it doesn't ring any bells.
 

1143
01:09:12 --> 01:09:13
You see this all the time.
 

1144
01:09:13 --> 01:09:17
I just saw it with sisters--
three year-old and a one

1145
01:09:17 --> 01:09:23
year-old, and it's an absolute
classic if you're in a

1146
01:09:23 --> 01:09:23
Freudian frame of mind.
 

1147
01:09:23 --> 01:09:28
An absolutely classic reaction
formation-- I love you so

1148
01:09:28 --> 01:09:31
much that I'm going to hug
you till you turn blue.

1149
01:09:31 --> 01:09:35
 
 

1150
01:09:35 --> 01:09:37
And you know,
what's that about?

1151
01:09:37 --> 01:09:39
The kid doesn't do that.
 

1152
01:09:39 --> 01:09:45
The observation is that it is
unusual to see a kid take their

1153
01:09:45 --> 01:09:50
teddy bear, for instance,
and say, I love you so much.

1154
01:09:50 --> 01:09:51
Squish, squish, squish.
 

1155
01:09:51 --> 01:09:51
Uh-uh.
 

1156
01:09:51 --> 01:09:56
It's a characteristic behavior
of older sibs to younger sibs.

1157
01:09:56 --> 01:10:00
 
 

1158
01:10:00 --> 01:10:06
So it kind of looks like Freud
might've been onto something.

1159
01:10:06 --> 01:10:11
Again, all normal stuff
that you've got to have.

1160
01:10:11 --> 01:10:14
It's not that reaction
formation is sick, weird stuff

1161
01:10:14 --> 01:10:20
or that denial means that you
are an emotional cripple

1162
01:10:20 --> 01:10:21
or something like that.
 

1163
01:10:21 --> 01:10:27
Freud says, the only way that
you can function is by having a

1164
01:10:27 --> 01:10:31
set of mechanisms to defend
yourself against this stuff.

1165
01:10:31 --> 01:10:35
And what he thought he was
seeing when he was seeing

1166
01:10:35 --> 01:10:38
patients is cases where
this didn't work so well.

1167
01:10:38 --> 01:10:41
 
 

1168
01:10:41 --> 01:10:45
Let's continue with
my football example.

1169
01:10:45 --> 01:10:50
 
 

1170
01:10:50 --> 01:10:53
There's this guy who somehow
reminded you of your little

1171
01:10:53 --> 01:10:57
brother, you've tackled him,
all right already, but now

1172
01:10:57 --> 01:11:01
you're reaching for the axe
that's conveniently located on

1173
01:11:01 --> 01:11:05
the sidelines or something
like that and these defense

1174
01:11:05 --> 01:11:09
mechanism are sitting there
working overtime saying, what

1175
01:11:09 --> 01:11:11
are you going to do here?
 

1176
01:11:11 --> 01:11:11
Can we make him love him?
 

1177
01:11:11 --> 01:11:13
No.
 

1178
01:11:13 --> 01:11:14
Man, we don't have enough time.
 

1179
01:11:14 --> 01:11:17
Let's just repress
the whole thing.

1180
01:11:17 --> 01:11:18
We'll repress everything.
 

1181
01:11:18 --> 01:11:18
Forget it.
 

1182
01:11:18 --> 01:11:23
Forget all this business and
forget the whole arm too.

1183
01:11:23 --> 01:11:25
We got to act fast to
prevent a complete

1184
01:11:25 --> 01:11:27
disaster from happening.
 

1185
01:11:27 --> 01:11:31
And so you end up in Dr.
Freud's office saying,

1186
01:11:31 --> 01:11:33
Doc, I can't move my arm.
 

1187
01:11:33 --> 01:11:36
I have no idea why.
 

1188
01:11:36 --> 01:11:43
And the job of therapy, what
Freud decided once he abandoned

1189
01:11:43 --> 01:11:47
hypnosis was that what was
therapeutic was to get that

1190
01:11:47 --> 01:11:53
hidden material out in a safe
atmosphere where it's energy

1191
01:11:53 --> 01:11:57
could be dissipated and that
that would be curative.

1192
01:11:57 --> 01:12:03
And his method of treatment
was designed to do that.

1193
01:12:03 --> 01:12:07
The idea of lying on a couch,
the great image that everybody

1194
01:12:07 --> 01:12:10
has of Freudian psychoanalysis
is of a patient lying on the

1195
01:12:10 --> 01:12:14
couch with Freud behind him--
with the analyst behind him not

1196
01:12:14 --> 01:12:18
looking at him because there's
something different and in a

1197
01:12:18 --> 01:12:21
sense protected about
conversations where you're not

1198
01:12:21 --> 01:12:25
making eye contact
with the person.

1199
01:12:25 --> 01:12:27
The closest that most of us
get to this is conversations

1200
01:12:27 --> 01:12:29
had in the car.
 

1201
01:12:29 --> 01:12:32
I don't know if you've had this
experience, but where both of

1202
01:12:32 --> 01:12:36
you are sitting in the car
looking out the front window,

1203
01:12:36 --> 01:12:39
you can have conversations that
you just don't have if you're

1204
01:12:39 --> 01:12:43
looking at each other
over the dinner table or

1205
01:12:43 --> 01:12:45
something like that.
 

1206
01:12:45 --> 01:12:48
I certainly know that I've had
conversations with both my

1207
01:12:48 --> 01:12:53
parents and my children of that
form where it really helps.

1208
01:12:53 --> 01:12:56
One of them is the passenger,
but the driver is not doing

1209
01:12:56 --> 01:13:00
this because you're
going to all die.

1210
01:13:00 --> 01:13:01
It makes a real difference.
 

1211
01:13:01 --> 01:13:03
All right, what do you
do then once you're

1212
01:13:03 --> 01:13:05
lying on that couch?
 

1213
01:13:05 --> 01:13:10
Well, what you don't do is lie
down and say Doc, my hand is

1214
01:13:10 --> 01:13:14
paralyzed and he says, well
do you hate your brother?

1215
01:13:14 --> 01:13:17
That's not the way it works.
 

1216
01:13:17 --> 01:13:22
The classic form of a
psychoanalytic session would

1217
01:13:22 --> 01:13:27
involve you lying there and
just talking, doing what Freud

1218
01:13:27 --> 01:13:31
called free association; saying
whatever came into your mind.

1219
01:13:31 --> 01:13:34
 
 

1220
01:13:34 --> 01:13:40
So here's your mind and in
here somewhere is this nugget

1221
01:13:40 --> 01:13:42
that we're trying to find.
 

1222
01:13:42 --> 01:13:45
And Freud just sets you loose.
 

1223
01:13:45 --> 01:13:48
 
 

1224
01:13:48 --> 01:13:52
And you're wandering around in
semantic network space, if you

1225
01:13:52 --> 01:13:54
like, or something like that.
 

1226
01:13:54 --> 01:13:55
Oh you know, here I am.
 

1227
01:13:55 --> 01:14:02
I'm lecturing in intro psych
and that reminds me of other

1228
01:14:02 --> 01:14:06
forms of combat and oh yeah,
reminds me of playing

1229
01:14:06 --> 01:14:09
football, which I don't do.
 

1230
01:14:09 --> 01:14:12
Remember that time I was
playing the guy and he reminded

1231
01:14:12 --> 01:14:15
me of my brother and I
thought I'd kill him-- no.

1232
01:14:15 --> 01:14:16
That's not what happens.
 

1233
01:14:16 --> 01:14:19
It's not that you somehow
get sucked into this.

1234
01:14:19 --> 01:14:22
You're wandering around and by
chance at some point you bump

1235
01:14:22 --> 01:14:26
up against this, and what Freud
was looking for was not some

1236
01:14:26 --> 01:14:30
flash of realization that-- oh
my goodness, I just found it!

1237
01:14:30 --> 01:14:33
But you'd be going
oh, [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1238
01:14:33 --> 01:14:34
and football.
 

1239
01:14:34 --> 01:14:36
You know, I have a really
interesting math problem I'd

1240
01:14:36 --> 01:14:40
like to tell you about.
 

1241
01:14:40 --> 01:14:41
Yeah, OK?
 

1242
01:14:41 --> 01:14:42
Tell me.
 

1243
01:14:42 --> 01:14:47
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]
 

1244
01:14:47 --> 01:14:50
And all of a sudden you're
going that way and now

1245
01:14:50 --> 01:14:53
you've reversed completely.
 

1246
01:14:53 --> 01:14:55
What Freud was doing was
listening for places

1247
01:14:55 --> 01:14:59
where you ran into a
barrier of some sort.

1248
01:14:59 --> 01:15:02
Could be a jump in the
logic of the talk.

1249
01:15:02 --> 01:15:06
It could be sort of a reversal
in direction, if you like.

1250
01:15:06 --> 01:15:12
It could just be a pause.
 

1251
01:15:12 --> 01:15:15
That all of a sudden you
couldn't think of anything.

1252
01:15:15 --> 01:15:17
Why aren't you talking?
 

1253
01:15:17 --> 01:15:18
I got nothing to say.
 

1254
01:15:18 --> 01:15:22
Yeah, right.
 

1255
01:15:22 --> 01:15:26
Or it could be a speech error.
 

1256
01:15:26 --> 01:15:27
Another place where I think
Freud was wrong, I don't

1257
01:15:27 --> 01:15:30
remember if he actually ever
said what's attributed to him

1258
01:15:30 --> 01:15:34
in this case, but Freud
certainly believed that speech

1259
01:15:34 --> 01:15:35
errors were informative.
 

1260
01:15:35 --> 01:15:37
He may have said that
all speech errors

1261
01:15:37 --> 01:15:38
were Freudian slips.
 

1262
01:15:38 --> 01:15:41
I mean, he wouldn't have called
them Freudian slips, but

1263
01:15:41 --> 01:15:46
were the result of a
defense mechanism.

1264
01:15:46 --> 01:15:48
That's not right.
 

1265
01:15:48 --> 01:15:52
When your mother calls you by
the name of your sibling, it's

1266
01:15:52 --> 01:15:56
probably not that she loves
the sibling more than you,

1267
01:15:56 --> 01:15:58
or something like that.
 

1268
01:15:58 --> 01:16:03
It's probably just that they're
stored nearby and in the effort

1269
01:16:03 --> 01:16:06
to get speech out you
grab the wrong thing.

1270
01:16:06 --> 01:16:09
There are lots of speech errors
like that, but there's no

1271
01:16:09 --> 01:16:13
denying that there are
speech errors that seem

1272
01:16:13 --> 01:16:15
fraught with meaning.
 

1273
01:16:15 --> 01:16:22
So years ago there was a
faculty minicourse here given

1274
01:16:22 --> 01:16:25
by the course 21 folks
where faculty could go and

1275
01:16:25 --> 01:16:27
we could sit and read
Shakespeare together.

1276
01:16:27 --> 01:16:29
Lots of fun.
 

1277
01:16:29 --> 01:16:33
The then head of the literature
section of 21 was lecturing

1278
01:16:33 --> 01:16:34
about Measure For Measure.
 

1279
01:16:34 --> 01:16:36
Measure For Measure
has a duke in it.

1280
01:16:36 --> 01:16:40
He wanted to talk about the
evil duke and out of his

1281
01:16:40 --> 01:16:42
mouth came a sentence
about the evil dean.

1282
01:16:42 --> 01:16:45
 
 

1283
01:16:45 --> 01:16:49
This was a man who everyone in
the audience knew was fighting

1284
01:16:49 --> 01:16:55
tooth and nail with the then
dean of humanities and you

1285
01:16:55 --> 01:16:59
listen to that and you just say
Freud was on to something.

1286
01:16:59 --> 01:17:05
But at the same time, almost
exactly the same era, I'm

1287
01:17:05 --> 01:17:08
walking down the street with my
wife, I look off to one side, I

1288
01:17:08 --> 01:17:13
say to my wife, look at that
beautiful bunch of lenses.

1289
01:17:13 --> 01:17:20
And my wife looks at me like,
oh there he goes again, but

1290
01:17:20 --> 01:17:22
then looks over there and
realizes that what I had seen

1291
01:17:22 --> 01:17:28
was a collection of
irises, the flower.

1292
01:17:28 --> 01:17:34
If you are a vision
researcher-- lenses--

1293
01:17:34 --> 01:17:35
you got it.
 

1294
01:17:35 --> 01:17:40
Look it is unlikely that what
that was doing was reaching

1295
01:17:40 --> 01:17:44
some deep unconscious desire
of mine to poke out my

1296
01:17:44 --> 01:17:48
wife's eyes or something
unacceptable like that.

1297
01:17:48 --> 01:17:51
It with just a speech error.
 

1298
01:17:51 --> 01:17:54
And I suspect Freud knew that
at some level too, whatever

1299
01:17:54 --> 01:17:55
he may have written.
 

1300
01:17:55 --> 01:18:01
But what his job was as a
therapist was to slowly,

1301
01:18:01 --> 01:18:05
painstakingly listen to
his patient and see if

1302
01:18:05 --> 01:18:09
he could find the lump.
 

1303
01:18:09 --> 01:18:14
It's like those things you do
at Halloween haunted houses.

1304
01:18:14 --> 01:18:16
You know, you stick your hand
in some place where you

1305
01:18:16 --> 01:18:22
can't see, it's always
spaghetti or something.

1306
01:18:22 --> 01:18:24
No, it's not spaghetti?
 

1307
01:18:24 --> 01:18:26
It really is brains?
 

1308
01:18:26 --> 01:18:28
Well, anyway, so you
don't know what it is.

1309
01:18:28 --> 01:18:31
You're feeling around, that
it's sort of like that.

1310
01:18:31 --> 01:18:34
 
 

1311
01:18:34 --> 01:18:38
Oh, and last bit, since I know
the terms are on the handout.

1312
01:18:38 --> 01:18:43
Two other clues that Freud
believed were useful were

1313
01:18:43 --> 01:18:45
what he called transference
and countertransference.

1314
01:18:45 --> 01:18:54
In the protected environment of
the analytic session, analysts

1315
01:18:54 --> 01:18:57
train themselves-- Freud
trained himself to be as

1316
01:18:57 --> 01:18:59
emotionally neutral
as possible.

1317
01:18:59 --> 01:19:02
 
 

1318
01:19:02 --> 01:19:05
And have the setting as
neutral as possible.

1319
01:19:05 --> 01:19:08
And nevertheless he would hear
from time to time, with

1320
01:19:08 --> 01:19:13
actually some regularity,
accusations from his patient

1321
01:19:13 --> 01:19:18
like I'm having real trouble
dealing with the hostility that

1322
01:19:18 --> 01:19:22
I'm getting from you today
or something like that.

1323
01:19:22 --> 01:19:25
And he came to the conclusion
that what this was was a

1324
01:19:25 --> 01:19:29
transference of emotions from
the outside, from the

1325
01:19:29 --> 01:19:33
real problem onto the
protected setting of

1326
01:19:33 --> 01:19:35
the analytic session.
 

1327
01:19:35 --> 01:19:38
 
 

1328
01:19:38 --> 01:19:41
Anna O.'s hysterical pregnancy
could be seen as a sort

1329
01:19:41 --> 01:19:42
of transference here.
 

1330
01:19:42 --> 01:19:46
That a love or a romantic
attachment that might have been

1331
01:19:46 --> 01:19:53
appropriate out there somewhere
was being brought into

1332
01:19:53 --> 01:19:55
the analytic session.
 

1333
01:19:55 --> 01:20:00
Part of the idea of keeping
yourself emotionally neutral

1334
01:20:00 --> 01:20:05
was that you might catch
this feeling yourself.

1335
01:20:05 --> 01:20:08
Not hear it expressed directly
by the patient, but you might

1336
01:20:08 --> 01:20:12
find yourself feeling somehow
inexplicably hostile

1337
01:20:12 --> 01:20:13
to your patient.
 

1338
01:20:13 --> 01:20:15
That's countertransference.
 

1339
01:20:15 --> 01:20:19
You might think of it as a
sort of a form of empathy.

1340
01:20:19 --> 01:20:22
But it's sort of an odd form of
empathy where you're feeling

1341
01:20:22 --> 01:20:27
emotions that you don't think
are really yours

1342
01:20:27 --> 01:20:28
as the analyst.
 

1343
01:20:28 --> 01:20:31
It's not that you love your
patient or that you hate

1344
01:20:31 --> 01:20:34
your patient or that you
are actually anxious.

1345
01:20:34 --> 01:20:37
It's that you're picking up
this as though you were an

1346
01:20:37 --> 01:20:40
antenna for your patient.
 

1347
01:20:40 --> 01:20:44
Now of course the difficulty
is, do you really think it's

1348
01:20:44 --> 01:20:46
possible to keep completely
neutral about somebody

1349
01:20:46 --> 01:20:49
you're working with, maybe
several times a week?

1350
01:20:49 --> 01:20:52
 
 

1351
01:20:52 --> 01:20:57
How do you know when an emotion
that you're feeling is really a

1352
01:20:57 --> 01:21:00
countertransference, you the
analyst, or when it's

1353
01:21:00 --> 01:21:04
really just a lapse
in your own behavior?

1354
01:21:04 --> 01:21:09
These are the sorts of problems
that worried analysts in their

1355
01:21:09 --> 01:21:14
practice, but the broader goal
here is it's all

1356
01:21:14 --> 01:21:15
detective work.
 

1357
01:21:15 --> 01:21:19
You're looking for that lump so
you can bring it into the open,

1358
01:21:19 --> 01:21:23
diffuse it, and release it
so that it doesn't

1359
01:21:23 --> 01:21:25
trash the castle.
 

1360
01:21:25 --> 01:21:25
