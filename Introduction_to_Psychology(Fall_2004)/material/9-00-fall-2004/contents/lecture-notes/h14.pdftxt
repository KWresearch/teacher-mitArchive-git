Lecture 14  – Relationships and Social Exchange 
The Abstract:  In the last lecture, we looked at broad forces shaping the relationship 
between men and women. Today we look at the forces that shape individual 
relationships. What makes two people form a relationship? What keeps that relationship 
intact? Of course, there are many factors. We will look at some quasi-economic factors in 
the context of Social Exchange theory. The core of the theory is that people want to 
maximize their "profits" while, at the same time, they want their relationships to be fair 
and reciprocal. 

Your goal should be to understand how the various experiments described today support 
(or do not support) the theory. 

TWO NOTES ABOUT PAPER THREE: 
Note One: For paper three, you do NOT need to work from material on the 
website. Indeed, you will find that material to be absent. You need to find an 
interesting topic. You need to decide how it could fit into Gleitman. You need to 
write the new bit of Gleitman. 

Note Two: If you are revising a bit of Gleitman (e.g. adding some cool new 
references to a section), please be sure that your paper is not made up of large 
pieces of lightly rewritten Gleitman prose. You need to write your own stuff. 

Lecture Notes:

Psychopathological Theory of Love (well, not really a theory)


Back to Shakespeare 
"Lovers and madmen have such seething brains 
such shaping fantasies, that apprehend 
more than cool reason ever comprehends. 
The lunatic, the lover, and the poet 
Are of imagination all compact." 

MSND 5:1:4-8 

And a bit more Shakespeare 

Love is merely a madness and I tell you deserves a dark house and a whip 
as madmen do; and the reason they are not so punished and cured is that the 
lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too. 
(As You Like It, 3, 2, 391-395) 

Chemical Theory of Attraction (well, sort of chemical) 

The Proximity Effect or "You may have already met your life's partner"

Social Exchange and the Economics of Relationships 

Why does person A form a relationship with person B out of the set of all people? 

Evolutionary fitness? 

Why do some relationships never happen? (or what I did in High School). 

Why didn't my relationship happen? 

A different scenario


Why is there a problem in this case?


Can we identify an underlying principle here? 


___________ 

Well, yes, that is why I am asking.  The principle is 

The Rule of Reciprocity 

Reciprocity implies some form of economic valuation on our acts and attributes. 

Why? 

The analysis of the economics of social interaction is called Social Exchange Theory - Blau 

(1964) 

There are rewards:

There are costs

Profits are defined as Rewards – Costs


How precise are these calculations? 


Three tenets of social exchange theory 

1) people want to maximize profits 

2) Profits for A = Profits for B (approx) 

3) A relationship must be better than perceived alternatives in order to survive. 

Do people do this sort of math in the context of romantic relations?

How does that work in social exchange?

Are relationships really this mercantile and crass? 

Differences between economics and social exchange 

1)  Economic costs and benefits are more precise and calculable than social 

2)  The nature of negotiation is different. 

What about highly unequal exchanges?  Benefits that cannot be reciprocated 

Social exchange theory posses the problem but does not specify the solution
