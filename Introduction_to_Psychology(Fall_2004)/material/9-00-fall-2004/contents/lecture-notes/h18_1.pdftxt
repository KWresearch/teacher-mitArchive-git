Lecture 18  – Freud Goes Global: 

 From Little Red Riding Hood to the Roots of Civilization

The Abstract: In the last lecture, we considered the Freudian ideas of repression and
defense. In this lecture (and the next, perhaps), we will talk about two other sets of terms
that have entered our vocabulary. First is Freud’s “Structural Psychology” of Id, Ego, and
Superego. In talking about these, we will see how Freud saw the interaction of the person
drama and the larger dramas of civilization. In a nutshell, Freud thought that repression,
guilt, anxiety, and so forth were the price that had to be paid for civilization. In the second
part of the lecture, we will turn to Freud’s developmental theory of Oral, Anal, and Phallic
(or Oedipal) stages. Each of these is, in reality, less about bits of the body and more about
big issues facing a child (or adult). Is the world safe? Who controls me? What kind of
person am I? We will discuss this in the context of fairy tales because, among other
purposes, this will show how Freudian concepts can be used as a lens through which to see
literary texts. 

Lecture Notes 
PART ONE: Freud's Structural Psychology 
Ego, Id,  & Superego were part of the attempt to explain

how amoral babies grow into moral adults

Begin with an new born infant. 
From Tennyson’s poem, In Memoriam 
The baby new to earth and sky
What time his tender palm is pressed
Against the circle of the breast
Has never thought that "This is I?"
But as he grows he gathers much,
and learns the use of "I and me,"
And finds I am not what I see,
And other than the things I touch. 
Back to Freud

What does baby want? 

pleasure NOW

The ID = a collection of unbridled desires 
The initial state is of an infant is all ID. 
Where does pleasure come from (a glance ahead) 
Oral pleasures, oral issues 
Anal issues: Who is in control here? 
Phallic / oedipal issues  Am I a boy or a girl?

The oedipal conflict
