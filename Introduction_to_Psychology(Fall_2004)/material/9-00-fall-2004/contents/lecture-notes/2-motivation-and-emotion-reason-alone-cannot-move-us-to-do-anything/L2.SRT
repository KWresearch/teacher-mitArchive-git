1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:15
 
 

2
00:00:15 --> 00:00:20
PROFESSOR: OK what I want to do
for the first couple of minutes

3
00:00:20 --> 00:00:24
of today's lecture, well, I
guess looking at the hand-out

4
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
what I want to do is play fill-
in- the- blank with this

5
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
great picture of a neuron.
 

6
00:00:29 --> 00:00:32
I got to talk about the gross
structure of the brain last

7
00:00:32 --> 00:00:34
time, but I didn't get to say
anything about a neuron.

8
00:00:34 --> 00:00:42
Neurons are the,
are brain cells.

9
00:00:42 --> 00:00:44
Not all are brain cells, right?
 

10
00:00:44 --> 00:00:48
This is going to be a neuron.
 

11
00:00:48 --> 00:00:55
At least half the cells in the
brain would be in the category

12
00:00:55 --> 00:00:59
of glia, that's a word that
comes from the word for glue.

13
00:00:59 --> 00:01:01
And all the years I was
learning about this stuff,

14
00:01:01 --> 00:01:05
glia kind of got shoved
into the category of like

15
00:01:05 --> 00:01:07
support staff, right?
 

16
00:01:07 --> 00:01:10
These were the guys who cleaned
up after the neurons who were

17
00:01:10 --> 00:01:12
doing all the cool stuff.
 

18
00:01:12 --> 00:01:17
But it's becoming increasingly
clear that glia have many

19
00:01:17 --> 00:01:22
functions to play in brain
function beyond the merely

20
00:01:22 --> 00:01:26
vegetative, and if you go into
neuro-science, odds are that

21
00:01:26 --> 00:01:29
you'll end up learning a lot
more about glia than I did

22
00:01:29 --> 00:01:32
when I was taking the
equivalent of course.

23
00:01:32 --> 00:01:36
But the main units, if you like
computational units for the

24
00:01:36 --> 00:01:42
brain are neurons and so here's
a quick tour of a sort of a

25
00:01:42 --> 00:01:44
canonical typical neuron.
 

26
00:01:44 --> 00:01:47
A typical neuron would collect
information either from other

27
00:01:47 --> 00:01:53
neurons on from sense organs
through its dendrites, the word

28
00:01:53 --> 00:01:58
comes from tree-like, because
its branching structure.

29
00:01:58 --> 00:02:03
So all these little branches
making connections with lots of

30
00:02:03 --> 00:02:06
other neurons or with sense
organs in say the skin or

31
00:02:06 --> 00:02:12
something like that, and the
information that the dendrites

32
00:02:12 --> 00:02:15
collect you can think of as
being in the form of little

33
00:02:15 --> 00:02:19
pulses of excitation
or inhibition.

34
00:02:19 --> 00:02:23
They can be either positive
or negative in nature.

35
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
They flow down towards
the cell body here.

36
00:02:26 --> 00:02:28
The neuron is a cell
like other cells.

37
00:02:28 --> 00:02:32
It does all those good cellular
sorts of things, but for the

38
00:02:32 --> 00:02:37
purposes, for our purposes, its
big job is to act as a sort of

39
00:02:37 --> 00:02:41
a summator and to ask,
how excited am I?

40
00:02:41 --> 00:02:46
Am I, you know, if I sum up all
these pluses and minuses, am I

41
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
excited enough to want to
tell other neurons about my

42
00:02:49 --> 00:02:51
level of excitement here?
 

43
00:02:51 --> 00:02:58
If the excitement passes a
threshold, the neuron sends an

44
00:02:58 --> 00:03:08
action potential, a signal, an
action potential -- no, that

45
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
doesn't look right, does it?
 

46
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
Well, potential, there we go.
 

47
00:03:13 --> 00:03:18
This is why there's a handout,
right, because I can't spell

48
00:03:18 --> 00:03:21
under good circumstances, and
I can't spell online at all.

49
00:03:21 --> 00:03:24
Anyway, that should
say potential.

50
00:03:24 --> 00:03:28
It sends a signal down the
axon, the long wire of

51
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
the neuron is the axon.
 

52
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
 
 

53
00:03:34 --> 00:03:39
That action potential has a
couple of important properties.

54
00:03:39 --> 00:03:43
Property one is that it's
of a single polarity.

55
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
There aren't pluses and
minuses, there's just

56
00:03:45 --> 00:03:48
a single polarity.
 

57
00:03:48 --> 00:03:52
And it's a fixed size.
 

58
00:03:52 --> 00:03:55
A more excited neuron does
not produce bigger action

59
00:03:55 --> 00:03:58
potential, so how's a neuron
going to tell another neuron

60
00:03:58 --> 00:04:00
that it's more excited?
 

61
00:04:00 --> 00:04:01
Would you guess?
 

62
00:04:01 --> 00:04:05
It's going to say make
more action potential.

63
00:04:05 --> 00:04:12
So its frequency coating
it's level of excitement.

64
00:04:12 --> 00:04:17
But action potentials are fixed
size, and fixed sign electro

65
00:04:17 --> 00:04:21
chemical signals powering
their way down this axon.

66
00:04:21 --> 00:04:27
These bumps wrapping around
the axon are actually

67
00:04:27 --> 00:04:28
another cell type.
 

68
00:04:28 --> 00:04:35
They're a form of glia
known as myelin.

69
00:04:35 --> 00:04:40
They act as, it acts as
insulation, keeping the signal

70
00:04:40 --> 00:04:44
in one neuron separate from the
signal in others, and it also

71
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
acts to speed transmission.
 

72
00:04:46 --> 00:04:51
There are a number of
neurological diseases whose

73
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
cause is not a problem
with the neuron, but a

74
00:04:54 --> 00:04:55
problem with the myelin.
 

75
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
De-myelinating diseases, like
multiple sclerosis, for

76
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
example, have their affect
because the insulation is

77
00:05:02 --> 00:05:07
breaking down, not because the
nerve cells themselves

78
00:05:07 --> 00:05:08
are breaking down.
 

79
00:05:08 --> 00:05:14
That signal reaches the
arborization of the axon.

80
00:05:14 --> 00:05:16
It then goes off and talks to
a bunch of other neurons.

81
00:05:16 --> 00:05:22
Or if this was a motor neuron,
it would be talking to muscle.

82
00:05:22 --> 00:05:26
Typically it does not make a
direct electrical contact.

83
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
If you look at connections
between stuff in your

84
00:05:28 --> 00:05:31
computer, those are direct
electrical contacts.

85
00:05:31 --> 00:05:33
Not the way things work
in the nervous system.

86
00:05:33 --> 00:05:39
In the nervous system, there's
a small gap, called a synapse,

87
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
and to signal from one neuron
to another, an electrical

88
00:05:42 --> 00:05:47
signal coming down the axon
causes chemicals to be

89
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
released into the gap.
 

90
00:05:49 --> 00:05:55
They diffuse across the gap and
bind to receptors on the other

91
00:05:55 --> 00:06:01
side, and that binding either
produces a little plus or a

92
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
little minus, depending on the
nature of the chemical, the

93
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
nature of the receptor, and
then the whole process

94
00:06:06 --> 00:06:07
starts again.
 

95
00:06:07 --> 00:06:12
So you go from an essentially
electrical signal to a chemical

96
00:06:12 --> 00:06:18
signal then back to an
essentially electrical signal.

97
00:06:18 --> 00:06:22
These neuro trans, so called
neurotransmitter chemicals are

98
00:06:22 --> 00:06:30
the targets of lots of the
drugs that are used to modulate

99
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
mental states, like
antidepressant

100
00:06:33 --> 00:06:34
drugs, for example.
 

101
00:06:34 --> 00:06:38
And not just drugs over-
the- counter, or not

102
00:06:38 --> 00:06:39
just prescription drugs.
 

103
00:06:39 --> 00:06:40
Let's see, what are
you drinking there?

104
00:06:40 --> 00:06:44
Oh that's just tea, how boring.
 

105
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
Well, I wasn't actually
thinking she was probably

106
00:06:46 --> 00:06:50
putting away a margarita,
but that drug would be

107
00:06:50 --> 00:06:51
working on a synapse.
 

108
00:06:51 --> 00:06:56
The caffeine that you are
pouring into your brain is

109
00:06:56 --> 00:07:00
working on neurotransmitter
and synaptic properties.

110
00:07:00 --> 00:07:03
That where you get your chance
to affect large numbers

111
00:07:03 --> 00:07:06
of neurons at one time.
 

112
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
We'll talk more
about that later.

113
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
Now if I look at my cute little
diagram, yes you should have

114
00:07:12 --> 00:07:18
been able by now to fill in all
the -- I wonder what that

115
00:07:18 --> 00:07:20
interesting thing is at
the top, actually, the

116
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
middle one at the top.
 

117
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
What do you figure?
 

118
00:07:24 --> 00:07:26
Cell?
 

119
00:07:26 --> 00:07:28
It's not axon.
 

120
00:07:28 --> 00:07:28
It's not myelin.
 

121
00:07:28 --> 00:07:33
Those are the two at the
bottom right and center.

122
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
The one on the top right
is pointing to synapse.

123
00:07:36 --> 00:07:38
The one at the top left is
pointing to dendrites, and the

124
00:07:38 --> 00:07:43
one at the bottom left is
pointing to the cell body.

125
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
So --
 

126
00:07:45 --> 00:07:45
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

127
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
PROFESSOR: Well, the one on
the bottom left, I figure,

128
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
is pointing to the
soma, or cell body.

129
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
I think the one at the
top middle is pointing

130
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
to the whole thing.
 

131
00:07:54 --> 00:07:55
AUDIENCE: Neuron.
 

132
00:07:55 --> 00:07:56
PROFESSOR: Neuron, yeah.
 

133
00:07:56 --> 00:08:00
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

134
00:08:00 --> 00:08:02
PROFESSOR: Oh maybe,
ah, yes, thank you.

135
00:08:02 --> 00:08:05
Oh, somebody's been
doing their reading.

136
00:08:05 --> 00:08:08
Yes, OK, she, you are correct.
 

137
00:08:08 --> 00:08:10
So the top middle is almost
undoubtedly pointing to the

138
00:08:10 --> 00:08:12
axon, that whole long thing.
 

139
00:08:12 --> 00:08:19
And the bottom, what she's
pointing out is that the bottom

140
00:08:19 --> 00:08:27
middle one is pointing to the
valleys amongst the bumps, and

141
00:08:27 --> 00:08:36
those are called the
Nodes of Ranvier.

142
00:08:36 --> 00:08:40
Undoubtedly named after, you
know, Joe Ranvier, who I

143
00:08:40 --> 00:08:41
don't know anything about.
 

144
00:08:41 --> 00:08:48
But the way that myelin speeds
up transmission is it makes it

145
00:08:48 --> 00:08:51
possible for the action
potential, rather than just

146
00:08:51 --> 00:08:55
going down the axon in a nice
smooth fashion, it jumps

147
00:08:55 --> 00:08:58
from node to node.
 

148
00:08:58 --> 00:09:05
And so that's why the
nodes are interesting.

149
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
OK, I'm glad we've solved that.
 

150
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
You would have thought I would
have thought about that before

151
00:09:09 --> 00:09:12
putting the thing
on the handout.

152
00:09:12 --> 00:09:20
OK, any other questions about
neurons or things, yes --

153
00:09:20 --> 00:09:21
AUDIENCE: So, soma, is that
boring cell stuff happening

154
00:09:21 --> 00:09:22
all over the place?
 

155
00:09:22 --> 00:09:23
PROFESSOR: I mean, well,
there's boring cell stuff

156
00:09:23 --> 00:09:23
happening all over the place.
 

157
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
We shouldn't, of course call it
boring cell stuff, because then

158
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
guys in like, course seven come
in and, well, you know, put

159
00:09:28 --> 00:09:30
a hit on us and things.
 

160
00:09:30 --> 00:09:36
But yeah, neurons are cells
like other cells and they have

161
00:09:36 --> 00:09:39
to do all the, you know,
respiratory things that

162
00:09:39 --> 00:09:41
other cells have to do.
 

163
00:09:41 --> 00:09:45
But, you know, our interest
in them, of course, is as

164
00:09:45 --> 00:09:48
little communication and
computational units.

165
00:09:48 --> 00:09:48
Yes?
 

166
00:09:48 --> 00:09:51
AUDIENCE: What is the
myelin, exactly?

167
00:09:51 --> 00:09:54
PROFESSOR: It's another cell
type that wraps around the

168
00:09:54 --> 00:10:01
axon and acts as insulation
and speed bumps, I guess.

169
00:10:01 --> 00:10:03
You think of is these as the
speed bumps, except they

170
00:10:03 --> 00:10:07
speed things up rather
than slowing things down.

171
00:10:07 --> 00:10:11
Boy I bet that just
confused matters.

172
00:10:11 --> 00:10:21
OK that said, what I want
to today is to talk about

173
00:10:21 --> 00:10:24
why we do anything.
 

174
00:10:24 --> 00:10:29
It's the general
topic of motivation.

175
00:10:29 --> 00:10:35
But, you might, well, you
might ask a question

176
00:10:35 --> 00:10:37
like, why do you eat?
 

177
00:10:37 --> 00:10:40
And you say, well, you got to
eat because you need -- if

178
00:10:40 --> 00:10:43
you don't eat, you die.
 

179
00:10:43 --> 00:10:43
AUDIENCE: Prove it.
 

180
00:10:43 --> 00:10:45
PROFESSOR: Prove it, right.
 

181
00:10:45 --> 00:10:47
That's not a stupid point.
 

182
00:10:47 --> 00:10:50
He meant it as a stupid point,
but it's not a stupid point.

183
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
Does a rat -- why
does a rat eat?

184
00:10:52 --> 00:10:54
Does it know it's going to die?
 

185
00:10:54 --> 00:10:56
Is a rat sort of sitting there,
you know, with existential

186
00:10:56 --> 00:11:01
concerns about it's -- I don't
think so, particularly.

187
00:11:01 --> 00:11:05
And even if it were the
case, now, if you don't

188
00:11:05 --> 00:11:06
you you're going to die.
 

189
00:11:06 --> 00:11:09
Well, so what?
 

190
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
YOu've got to answer -- I mean
is it why you do anything is

191
00:11:12 --> 00:11:15
a question that requires
some sort of an answer.

192
00:11:15 --> 00:11:19
And I will give a
three- part answer.

193
00:11:19 --> 00:11:25
Part one of the answer will be
that you are a slave to, you

194
00:11:25 --> 00:11:28
do things as a slave
to the environment.

195
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
Part two will be that you do
things, as a slave, in fact, to

196
00:11:31 --> 00:11:37
your own brain, and part three
will be to say well, parts one

197
00:11:37 --> 00:11:39
and two seemed a little simple-
minded, we'd better try and get

198
00:11:39 --> 00:11:43
to a somewhat richer
explanation that might explain

199
00:11:43 --> 00:11:49
why you're sitting here in a
classroom doing this rather

200
00:11:49 --> 00:11:53
complicated activity, since
what we'll be talking about is

201
00:11:53 --> 00:11:56
-- oh, one of the things will
be talking about is the reason

202
00:11:56 --> 00:12:00
that -- is the obvious fact
that I'm a psych professor

203
00:12:00 --> 00:12:02
and not an artist.
 

204
00:12:02 --> 00:12:06
So you will have to bear with
the fact that, for present

205
00:12:06 --> 00:12:13
purposes, that is a cat,
and that is a rat.

206
00:12:13 --> 00:12:17
 
 

207
00:12:17 --> 00:12:20
You are neither, are the third
part of the lecture will be

208
00:12:20 --> 00:12:27
devoted to trying to talk up
about the richer set of

209
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
motivations that you might
have, and that even

210
00:12:29 --> 00:12:32
animals might have.
 

211
00:12:32 --> 00:12:35
Well, a good starting place,
even if it's a bad bit of

212
00:12:35 --> 00:12:40
art, would be -- this is an
unusually pathetic

213
00:12:40 --> 00:12:42
cat, even for me.
 

214
00:12:42 --> 00:12:52
Back in the -- shortly before
the turn of the last century,

215
00:12:52 --> 00:12:56
Thorndike, Edward Thorndike up
at Harvard was doing

216
00:12:56 --> 00:13:00
experiments of the following
form: he would take cats, who

217
00:13:00 --> 00:13:06
were hungry cats, and he would
throw them in a box that looked

218
00:13:06 --> 00:13:11
sort of like a packing crate
kind of thing, you know, slats

219
00:13:11 --> 00:13:17
all the place, and outside of
the box is fish, well, bit of

220
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
fish, but if I drew a bit of
fish, you'd never

221
00:13:19 --> 00:13:20
know what it was.
 

222
00:13:20 --> 00:13:21
This at least looks
sort of like a fish.

223
00:13:21 --> 00:13:23
So there's a bit of fish.
 

224
00:13:23 --> 00:13:24
You got a hungry cat.
 

225
00:13:24 --> 00:13:25
You got the fish.
 

226
00:13:25 --> 00:13:28
Cat wants fish.
 

227
00:13:28 --> 00:13:29
What's the cat going to do?
 

228
00:13:29 --> 00:13:36
Well, the cat is of bouncing
off the walls being annoyed and

229
00:13:36 --> 00:13:42
agitated and the way this box
is set up is, well, they're

230
00:13:42 --> 00:13:47
called puzzle boxes, because
in effect, er there's a

231
00:13:47 --> 00:13:48
trick to getting out.
 

232
00:13:48 --> 00:13:53
It might be that there's a
lever back here that's attached

233
00:13:53 --> 00:13:58
to some string and pulley
arrangement that lifts a gate

234
00:13:58 --> 00:14:03
over here, and if the cat
happens to bounce into this

235
00:14:03 --> 00:14:08
lever, the gate goes up, the
cat goes out, gets the fish.

236
00:14:08 --> 00:14:11
Great, well it's a little piece
of fish, and he's a hungry cat.

237
00:14:11 --> 00:14:14
And what happens to the cat
immediately thereafter, is

238
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
Thorndike grabs the cat again,
throws him back in the box.

239
00:14:18 --> 00:14:19
What's the cat do?
 

240
00:14:19 --> 00:14:26
Well, whatever the cat is
doing, what Thorndike is doing

241
00:14:26 --> 00:14:33
is measuring the amount of time
that it takes for the cat

242
00:14:33 --> 00:14:36
to get out of the box.
 

243
00:14:36 --> 00:14:41
As a function of the number of
times that the cat has been

244
00:14:41 --> 00:14:42
chucked back in the box.
 

245
00:14:42 --> 00:14:49
So you've got time as a
function of -- we can call them

246
00:14:49 --> 00:14:52
trials, the number of times the
cat has been in the box.

247
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
It initially takes the
cat some amount of time.

248
00:14:54 --> 00:14:57
The next time maybe it's a
little quicker, and you got

249
00:14:57 --> 00:15:02
some sort of a function that
eventually gets to some sort

250
00:15:02 --> 00:15:05
of asymptote where you
chuck the cat in the box.

251
00:15:05 --> 00:15:07
The cat looks at you in a
disgusted kind of way.

252
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
Goes over to level, says
"plahtttt", eats the

253
00:15:10 --> 00:15:14
fish, says, OK, we gotta
do this again, fine.

254
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
This is a learning curve.
 

255
00:15:16 --> 00:15:20
In fact, this is the original
use of the term learning curve,

256
00:15:20 --> 00:15:22
when you talk about going up
the learning curve and

257
00:15:22 --> 00:15:26
stuff like that, you
are invoking Thorndike.

258
00:15:26 --> 00:15:31
What is the cat learning?
 

259
00:15:31 --> 00:15:34
In the 19th century, and even
today if you go to, you know,

260
00:15:34 --> 00:15:37
the animal section of Borders
or something like that, there

261
00:15:37 --> 00:15:39
are lots of books that will
tell you about the, you know,

262
00:15:39 --> 00:15:44
the rich mental life of
your cat, and so on.

263
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
Thorndike wasn't buying it.
 

264
00:15:46 --> 00:15:54
What Thorndike said was
that there are good

265
00:15:54 --> 00:15:56
things in the world.
 

266
00:15:56 --> 00:15:59
We'll call those reinforcers.
 

267
00:15:59 --> 00:16:06
 
 

268
00:16:06 --> 00:16:08
They come in two forms.
 

269
00:16:08 --> 00:16:10
There are positive reinforcers.
 

270
00:16:10 --> 00:16:16
 
 

271
00:16:16 --> 00:16:21
Well here, as an example, if
you tell a joke and people

272
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
laugh, that's a positive
reinforcer. you did something.

273
00:16:24 --> 00:16:26
Something good happened.
 

274
00:16:26 --> 00:16:29
There are also
negative reinforcers.

275
00:16:29 --> 00:16:33
 
 

276
00:16:33 --> 00:16:34
Those are also good things.
 

277
00:16:34 --> 00:16:38
The jargon IS unfortunate,
but a negative reinforcer

278
00:16:38 --> 00:16:39
is a good thing.
 

279
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
Focus on the reinforcement
part not the negative part.

280
00:16:42 --> 00:16:49
A negative reinforcer is the
car alarm is going off, right?

281
00:16:49 --> 00:16:54
You do something that
makes that noise stop.

282
00:16:54 --> 00:16:56
Right, that's a good thing.
 

283
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
The sensation of something
unpleasant, like hunger,

284
00:16:59 --> 00:17:02
for example, is a
negative reinforcer.

285
00:17:02 --> 00:17:03
It's also a good thing.
 

286
00:17:03 --> 00:17:07
A bad thing in this jargon
is punishment, is called

287
00:17:07 --> 00:17:09
punishment, right?
 

288
00:17:09 --> 00:17:11
You tell a joke.
 

289
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
The person you're telling
the joke to take

290
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
offense and smacks you.
 

291
00:17:15 --> 00:17:17
That's punishment.
 

292
00:17:17 --> 00:17:21
What Thorndike said, what
Thorndike formulated, which is

293
00:17:21 --> 00:17:28
undoubtedly on the handout
somewhere, is th law of effect.

294
00:17:28 --> 00:17:30
Yes, top of the second page.
 

295
00:17:30 --> 00:17:33
He proposed what he called
the law of effect.

296
00:17:33 --> 00:17:38
And he said that something
that's followed by a

297
00:17:38 --> 00:17:42
reinforcer, a behavior that's
followed by a reinforcer, is

298
00:17:42 --> 00:17:44
more likely to recur.
 

299
00:17:44 --> 00:17:45
Take the job example.
 

300
00:17:45 --> 00:17:49
If you tell a joke and
somebody, and people laugh, the

301
00:17:49 --> 00:17:52
next time the opportunity
presents itself, you are more

302
00:17:52 --> 00:17:54
likely to tell that joke.
 

303
00:17:54 --> 00:17:59
The negative law of effect
is or is not on the

304
00:17:59 --> 00:18:00
handout somewhere.
 

305
00:18:00 --> 00:18:02
Well, yes, there it is, a
little further down under where

306
00:18:02 --> 00:18:05
it says punishment, the
negative law of effect says

307
00:18:05 --> 00:18:07
that you do something, and
something bad happens, you're

308
00:18:07 --> 00:18:09
less likely to do it again.
 

309
00:18:09 --> 00:18:10
You tell a joke.
 

310
00:18:10 --> 00:18:13
Somebody smacks you, the next
time the opportunity presents

311
00:18:13 --> 00:18:17
itself, unless you're a teenage
male, odds are that you

312
00:18:17 --> 00:18:20
won't tell that joke again.
 

313
00:18:20 --> 00:18:24
Well, it is a separate problem.
 

314
00:18:24 --> 00:18:28
This is the burping
problem, right?

315
00:18:28 --> 00:18:34
When you were like 12 maybe,
you discovered you could burp

316
00:18:34 --> 00:18:38
the alphabet or something, and
your twelve- year- old guy

317
00:18:38 --> 00:18:40
friends thought it
was really great.

318
00:18:40 --> 00:18:44
So the behavior got reinforced,
and unfortunately it takes a

319
00:18:44 --> 00:18:47
lot of smacks before you
unlearn that, but that's

320
00:18:47 --> 00:18:48
actually the next lecture.
 

321
00:18:48 --> 00:18:50
We'll talk about
that next week.

322
00:18:50 --> 00:18:53
 
 

323
00:18:53 --> 00:18:57
I'm looking at the handout and
realizing that I failed to give

324
00:18:57 --> 00:19:01
you the great bunny example.
 

325
00:19:01 --> 00:19:04
And you're going to look
at your notes later and

326
00:19:04 --> 00:19:06
wonder what this is.
 

327
00:19:06 --> 00:19:09
But I can use that to
illustrate this same point.

328
00:19:09 --> 00:19:10
I have a rabbit.
 

329
00:19:10 --> 00:19:11
Anybody want a rabbit?
 

330
00:19:11 --> 00:19:12
We have a rabbit.
 

331
00:19:12 --> 00:19:13
It's an accident.
 

332
00:19:13 --> 00:19:14
You can have him.
 

333
00:19:14 --> 00:19:18
But anyway, this rabbit, when
I go down into the kitchen in

334
00:19:18 --> 00:19:20
the morning, goes berserk.
 

335
00:19:20 --> 00:19:23
He's thumping up and
down in his cage.

336
00:19:23 --> 00:19:24
Why is he?
 

337
00:19:24 --> 00:19:25
Well, what's he doing?
 

338
00:19:25 --> 00:19:31
Well basically, he's signaling
that it's time for breakfast.

339
00:19:31 --> 00:19:32
Not just any breakfast.
 

340
00:19:32 --> 00:19:35
If you give him rabbit
chow, he keeps thumping.

341
00:19:35 --> 00:19:38
He's addicted to Reese's
pieces, not Reese's pieces,

342
00:19:38 --> 00:19:40
the Reese's cereal.
 

343
00:19:40 --> 00:19:43
It's very sad.
 

344
00:19:43 --> 00:19:46
He's a sugar cereal junkie.
 

345
00:19:46 --> 00:19:53
And in these terms, what's
happened, the way, where his

346
00:19:53 --> 00:19:56
behavior is coming from, what's
driving his behavior, is he was

347
00:19:56 --> 00:20:00
making some sort of arbitrary
noise at some point when we fed

348
00:20:00 --> 00:20:03
him, and perhaps when we fed
him Reese's cereal

349
00:20:03 --> 00:20:05
the first time.
 

350
00:20:05 --> 00:20:07
It was really good.
 

351
00:20:07 --> 00:20:09
It was a positive reinforcer.
 

352
00:20:09 --> 00:20:12
It made more likely the
behavior that he had

353
00:20:12 --> 00:20:13
just been doing.
 

354
00:20:13 --> 00:20:17
So the next time the
opportunity presented himself

355
00:20:17 --> 00:20:19
you went thump, thump, thump,
being the right time of day

356
00:20:19 --> 00:20:22
anyway he got more
Reese's stuff.

357
00:20:22 --> 00:20:29
And now, by this law of effect
kind of training, he has

358
00:20:29 --> 00:20:34
learned that if he goes thump,
thump, thump, we'll remember

359
00:20:34 --> 00:20:36
that it's time for
the sweet cereal.

360
00:20:36 --> 00:20:39
And he gets very disappointed
when it turns out that, you

361
00:20:39 --> 00:20:42
know, that the sweet cereal
supply has run out and we're

362
00:20:42 --> 00:20:45
trying to feed him like
some health food stuff.

363
00:20:45 --> 00:20:48
He's not interested.
 

364
00:20:48 --> 00:20:52
Carrots are OK,
but only barely.

365
00:20:52 --> 00:20:57
So why is it that animals
-- well, how many of

366
00:20:57 --> 00:20:59
you have cats and dogs?
 

367
00:20:59 --> 00:21:02
Cats or dogs, one or the other,
you don't have to have both.

368
00:21:02 --> 00:21:04
Almost all of you can probably
tell me something about the

369
00:21:04 --> 00:21:08
brilliant, intelligent behavior
of this dog that doesn't sound,

370
00:21:08 --> 00:21:11
or cat, that doesn't sound like
this sort of accidental

371
00:21:11 --> 00:21:14
learning of an association
between a behavior and

372
00:21:14 --> 00:21:15
it's consequences.
 

373
00:21:15 --> 00:21:18
This sort of association
learning, by the way, is what

374
00:21:18 --> 00:21:20
I'll talk about, the rules
of it I'll talk about

375
00:21:20 --> 00:21:22
extensively next week.
 

376
00:21:22 --> 00:21:26
But why is it that we're so
convinced that animals have a

377
00:21:26 --> 00:21:28
much richer intellectual life?
 

378
00:21:28 --> 00:21:30
Well, one possibility is
that they do have a richer

379
00:21:30 --> 00:21:32
intellectual life than this.
 

380
00:21:32 --> 00:21:36
The other, the one that
Thorndike thought he was

381
00:21:36 --> 00:21:40
seeing, was what really boils
down to selective reporting.

382
00:21:40 --> 00:21:42
Did I put the whole
quote on the handout?

383
00:21:42 --> 00:21:44
No.
 

384
00:21:44 --> 00:21:50
What Thorndike said is dogs get
lost hundreds of times, and

385
00:21:50 --> 00:21:54
nobody ever notices it or sends
an account to a scientific

386
00:21:54 --> 00:21:59
magazine, but let one dog find
his way from Brooklyn to

387
00:21:59 --> 00:22:02
Yonkers, and that fact
immediately becomes a

388
00:22:02 --> 00:22:04
circulating anecdote.
 

389
00:22:04 --> 00:22:10
Thousands of cats, he says, sit
on thousands of occasions

390
00:22:10 --> 00:22:14
helplessly yowling, and nobody
ever writes to his friend,

391
00:22:14 --> 00:22:16
the professor, about it.
 

392
00:22:16 --> 00:22:23
But let one cat claw at the
knob, seemingly in, supposedly

393
00:22:23 --> 00:22:28
as a signal to be let out, and
straight away, that cat becomes

394
00:22:28 --> 00:22:30
the representative
of the cat mind.

395
00:22:30 --> 00:22:34
What Thorndike thought was,
that you are, well at least the

396
00:22:34 --> 00:22:38
cat, and by extension, you are,
a slave to your environment.

397
00:22:38 --> 00:22:42
The contingencies in your
environment shape what you do.

398
00:22:42 --> 00:22:46
If the environment rewards
you for pushing this lever,

399
00:22:46 --> 00:22:48
you'll push this lever.
 

400
00:22:48 --> 00:22:53
And the cleverness, and the
content of that, the seeming

401
00:22:53 --> 00:22:57
content of that, is
imposed from the outside.

402
00:22:57 --> 00:22:57
It's not there.
 

403
00:22:57 --> 00:22:59
It's not necessary.
 

404
00:22:59 --> 00:23:02
You can explain it all, you can
explain why you do things

405
00:23:02 --> 00:23:08
purely in terms of these,
of this law of effect.

406
00:23:08 --> 00:23:09
Suitably elaborated.
 

407
00:23:09 --> 00:23:13
And as I say, the suitable
elaboration on that will

408
00:23:13 --> 00:23:19
come, will come next week.
 

409
00:23:19 --> 00:23:21
The elaboration, by the way, is
known as behaviorism and the

410
00:23:21 --> 00:23:24
school of scientific, of
psychological thought, that

411
00:23:24 --> 00:23:33
says that the explanation for
your behavior can be found in

412
00:23:33 --> 00:23:40
the contingencies that relate
your actions to their

413
00:23:40 --> 00:23:43
consequences in the world and
that relates, the relationships

414
00:23:43 --> 00:23:47
between stimulae in the world.
 

415
00:23:47 --> 00:23:51
That gets you some distance,
but what is it that actually

416
00:23:51 --> 00:23:54
makes something reinforcing?
 

417
00:23:54 --> 00:23:58
Why should something be
reinforcing at all?

418
00:23:58 --> 00:24:03
What is it about say food that,
you know, why does the cat

419
00:24:03 --> 00:24:08
care that he gets out and
satisfies his hunger?

420
00:24:08 --> 00:24:14
For that, you want to switch to
the second form of slavery,

421
00:24:14 --> 00:24:20
which is this notion that you
are slave to your own

422
00:24:20 --> 00:24:21
brain in a sense.
 

423
00:24:21 --> 00:24:28
And the emblematic experiment
for that is done some 50 years

424
00:24:28 --> 00:24:31
after Thorndike is working
with his puzzle box.

425
00:24:31 --> 00:24:35
And that comes from an
experiment done by [? Olton ?]

426
00:24:35 --> 00:24:35
[? Milner ?].
 

427
00:24:35 --> 00:24:38
It actually started as a
mistake done by [? Olton ?]

428
00:24:38 --> 00:24:38
[? Milner ?].
 

429
00:24:38 --> 00:24:42
Here's what they were doing.
 

430
00:24:42 --> 00:24:45
They were sticking electrodes
it's into the brain of rats,

431
00:24:45 --> 00:24:52
into the brains of rats, down
into the brain stem, because

432
00:24:52 --> 00:24:55
what they wanted to do
was to study arousal.

433
00:24:55 --> 00:24:59
Centers down in the brain stem,
I mentioned last time, are

434
00:24:59 --> 00:25:03
intimately involved in things
like sleep and wake, so a

435
00:25:03 --> 00:25:04
general level of arousal.
 

436
00:25:04 --> 00:25:08
How do you know if a
rat is aroused or not?

437
00:25:08 --> 00:25:12
Well, one of the ways to
measure arousal in a rat is

438
00:25:12 --> 00:25:14
just to look at the amount
of activity that that

439
00:25:14 --> 00:25:16
rat is emitting.
 

440
00:25:16 --> 00:25:19
A rat that's just sort of
sitting there is not very

441
00:25:19 --> 00:25:20
aroused, and a rat that's
running around is

442
00:25:20 --> 00:25:22
presumably aroused.
 

443
00:25:22 --> 00:25:24
Great, so they're going to
stick an electrode into a rat's

444
00:25:24 --> 00:25:28
brain and look at general
levels of activity.

445
00:25:28 --> 00:25:33
There's a problem that requires
a control experiment first.

446
00:25:33 --> 00:25:37
What other than sort of
generalized arousal might

447
00:25:37 --> 00:25:41
get a rat to run around,
would you think?

448
00:25:41 --> 00:25:42
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

449
00:25:42 --> 00:25:44
PROFESSOR: Sticking an
electrode into their brain.

450
00:25:44 --> 00:25:49
Yeah, well, why might sticking
an elecrode in their brain

451
00:25:49 --> 00:25:50
make them run around?
 

452
00:25:50 --> 00:25:54
AUDIENCE: Pain.
 

453
00:25:54 --> 00:25:55
PROFESSOR: Pain, it
might hurt, right?

454
00:25:55 --> 00:26:03
You know, so suppose all that
happens when you turn on the

455
00:26:03 --> 00:26:05
electricity, you know, to
stimulate the brain of

456
00:26:05 --> 00:26:07
the rat is it hurts.
 

457
00:26:07 --> 00:26:10
The rat is going to run around,
but you wouldn't want to argue

458
00:26:10 --> 00:26:14
that this is a center for
generalized arousal.

459
00:26:14 --> 00:26:16
Plus, you might not really
want to be, you know,

460
00:26:16 --> 00:26:17
hurting your poor rat.
 

461
00:26:17 --> 00:26:20
So anyway, here's the
experiment that they did.

462
00:26:20 --> 00:26:25
What they did was they watched
the electrodes in the rat, and

463
00:26:25 --> 00:26:29
they're looking at the rat, and
they only turn the electricity

464
00:26:29 --> 00:26:33
on when the rat is over in
this part of the cage.

465
00:26:33 --> 00:26:35
So, turn on the electricity.
 

466
00:26:35 --> 00:26:39
If it hurts, what
does the rat do?

467
00:26:39 --> 00:26:41
AUDIENCE: Runs around.
 

468
00:26:41 --> 00:26:41
PROFESSOR: Runs around, but...
 

469
00:26:41 --> 00:26:42
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].
 

470
00:26:42 --> 00:26:45
PROFESSOR: To the other,
but hey, ooh, it stopped.

471
00:26:45 --> 00:26:50
Now wander back over
here, oh, no, OK, right?

472
00:26:50 --> 00:26:52
Everybody knows
rats learn this.

473
00:26:52 --> 00:26:55
They knew that nobody
had done this with

474
00:26:55 --> 00:26:57
stimulation of the brain.
 

475
00:26:57 --> 00:27:02
This is so-called
aversive learning.

476
00:27:02 --> 00:27:04
One of the typical ways of
doing it is you electrify the

477
00:27:04 --> 00:27:07
floor of the cage, right?
 

478
00:27:07 --> 00:27:11
So, the rat goes over here,
discovers that when he puts his

479
00:27:11 --> 00:27:14
little rat toes on the cage
floor over here, there's

480
00:27:14 --> 00:27:18
electric current running
through it and phew,

481
00:27:18 --> 00:27:19
he's over here.
 

482
00:27:19 --> 00:27:22
OK, so that's what they did,
and so the rat goes over here,

483
00:27:22 --> 00:27:28
and on comes the juice for a
little bit, and the rat doesn't

484
00:27:28 --> 00:27:30
go anywhere, and then the juice
goes off, and the rat is

485
00:27:30 --> 00:27:34
wandering around and then the
rat comes back over here, juice

486
00:27:34 --> 00:27:36
comes on for a little bit.
 

487
00:27:36 --> 00:27:39
Rat doesn't go anywhere.
 

488
00:27:39 --> 00:27:42
In fact, the rat comes
back over here.

489
00:27:42 --> 00:27:46
The rat is sort of hanging
around over here, yeah,

490
00:27:46 --> 00:27:48
let's do that again.
 

491
00:27:48 --> 00:27:57
Turns out that the rat was
behaving as though the

492
00:27:57 --> 00:27:59
stimulation was reinforcing.
 

493
00:27:59 --> 00:28:05
We could say as though he
wanted to be stimulated, but

494
00:28:05 --> 00:28:08
it's a little dicey to talk
about what a rat wants

495
00:28:08 --> 00:28:09
or doesn't want.
 

496
00:28:09 --> 00:28:10
So you can use this
more neutral language

497
00:28:10 --> 00:28:11
of reinforcement.
 

498
00:28:11 --> 00:28:16
The rat was behaving as
though stimulation of the

499
00:28:16 --> 00:28:17
brain was reinforcing.
 

500
00:28:17 --> 00:28:19
This was a surprise
to [? Olton ?]

501
00:28:19 --> 00:28:20
[? Milner. ?]
 

502
00:28:20 --> 00:28:24
The next surprise came when
they actually looked at where

503
00:28:24 --> 00:28:28
the electrode had gone in
this particular rat's brain.

504
00:28:28 --> 00:28:29
That's the mistake part.
 

505
00:28:29 --> 00:28:34
It turns out the electrode had
bent, and instead of being

506
00:28:34 --> 00:28:38
where they wanted it in the
brain stem, it was in the chunk

507
00:28:38 --> 00:28:40
of brain known as the
lateral hypothalamus.

508
00:28:40 --> 00:28:43
At least we think it was in
the lateral hypothalamus.

509
00:28:43 --> 00:28:46
Don't actually know, because
not only did the electrode

510
00:28:46 --> 00:28:50
bend, but then they
lost the brain.

511
00:28:50 --> 00:28:54
Subsequently, they did
very well for all the

512
00:28:54 --> 00:28:55
mistakes they made here.
 

513
00:28:55 --> 00:28:56
Hypothalamus.
 

514
00:28:56 --> 00:29:00
 
 

515
00:29:00 --> 00:29:07
So, what they did that was to
deliberately stick electrodes

516
00:29:07 --> 00:29:11
into the hypothalamus and to
set the experiment up in a more

517
00:29:11 --> 00:29:15
formal fashion, beautifully
illustrated here by my rat,

518
00:29:15 --> 00:29:17
who's got an electrode in his
brain, and that's a

519
00:29:17 --> 00:29:19
battery up there.
 

520
00:29:19 --> 00:29:20
And that's a lever.
 

521
00:29:20 --> 00:29:24
Now the rat can go off
and self- stimulate.

522
00:29:24 --> 00:29:29
He can go and choose, if he
pushes on this lever, he

523
00:29:29 --> 00:29:33
gets a little pulse of
electricity to his brain.

524
00:29:33 --> 00:29:34
And what does he do?
 

525
00:29:34 --> 00:29:38
Indeed, rats with electrodes
implanted in the right bits of

526
00:29:38 --> 00:29:41
the lateral hypothalamus will
sit there and work for brain

527
00:29:41 --> 00:29:45
stimulation, the way another
rat might work for rat pellets

528
00:29:45 --> 00:29:49
water if it's thirsty or
something like that.

529
00:29:49 --> 00:29:51
And they'll work hard.
 

530
00:29:51 --> 00:29:56
The most dramatic version I can
recall reading is a rat that

531
00:29:56 --> 00:30:03
will work bar pressing 7,000
times an hour, I think, for

532
00:30:03 --> 00:30:08
to keep the brain
stimulated there.

533
00:30:08 --> 00:30:11
So this is apparently
good stuff.

534
00:30:11 --> 00:30:12
Not everything there
is good stuff.

535
00:30:12 --> 00:30:16
There are chunks of brain where
the rat will work actively

536
00:30:16 --> 00:30:18
to turn off the stimulation.
 

537
00:30:18 --> 00:30:22
So again, so turning on the
stimulation would be a

538
00:30:22 --> 00:30:23
positive reinforcer.
 

539
00:30:23 --> 00:30:26
Turning off an aversive
stimulation, whether it's

540
00:30:26 --> 00:30:29
electricity to your feet or
electricity to the wrong

541
00:30:29 --> 00:30:33
part of your brain, that's
a negative reinforcer.

542
00:30:33 --> 00:30:35
So you know, there's current.
 

543
00:30:35 --> 00:30:38
If you push the button
the current stops.

544
00:30:38 --> 00:30:42
That's good from the
rat's point of view.

545
00:30:42 --> 00:30:45
In various surveys of rat
brain, it turns out there

546
00:30:45 --> 00:30:48
are more positive locations
than negative locations.

547
00:30:48 --> 00:30:49
I don't know.
 

548
00:30:49 --> 00:30:51
You know, we don't know if
that's true of humans, and we

549
00:30:51 --> 00:30:55
don't know if that means
anything -- actually the study,

550
00:30:55 --> 00:31:00
the study that I noticed this
morning that I was thinking of

551
00:31:00 --> 00:31:03
here says that they're 60
percent, in this one study, 60

552
00:31:03 --> 00:31:07
percent neutral locations,
30 percent rewarding

553
00:31:07 --> 00:31:10
locations, and 5 percent
aversive locations.

554
00:31:10 --> 00:31:13
Now the mathematically
sophisticated among you

555
00:31:13 --> 00:31:16
will notice that adds
up to 95 percent.

556
00:31:16 --> 00:31:18
And neutral rewarding and
aversive would kind of seem to

557
00:31:18 --> 00:31:21
cover all the possibilities
here, so I have no idea what

558
00:31:21 --> 00:31:23
the other 5 percent of
neurons we're doing.

559
00:31:23 --> 00:31:26
That seems a lot for rounding
error or something.

560
00:31:26 --> 00:31:32
Anyway more pleasant locations
then unpleasant locations.

561
00:31:32 --> 00:31:38
Now, around this time, somebody
who is a science fiction buff

562
00:31:38 --> 00:31:42
should say, I've heard this
before, it shows up in one of

563
00:31:42 --> 00:31:47
several classic science
fiction stories.

564
00:31:47 --> 00:31:49
The world is full of science
fiction stories written by

565
00:31:49 --> 00:31:53
people just like you, which is
to say people who heard an

566
00:31:53 --> 00:31:57
introductory psych lecture and
thought I can make a

567
00:31:57 --> 00:31:58
story out of this.
 

568
00:31:58 --> 00:32:02
Memento, is perhaps the most
recent movie example of that.

569
00:32:02 --> 00:32:06
We'll get to that lecture
later on in the term.

570
00:32:06 --> 00:32:10
Anybody familiar with
the sci fi story that's

571
00:32:10 --> 00:32:13
related to the rats here?
 

572
00:32:13 --> 00:32:15
Any of the various
sci fi stories?

573
00:32:15 --> 00:32:16
AUDIENCE: Mrs. Frisbee?
 

574
00:32:16 --> 00:32:16
Is
 

575
00:32:16 --> 00:32:17
PROFESSOR: Oh, no.
 

576
00:32:17 --> 00:32:20
Mrs. Frisbee and
the rats of NIMH.

577
00:32:20 --> 00:32:26
What's -- no, apart from the
fact that NIMH is short for the

578
00:32:26 --> 00:32:31
National Institute of Mental
Health and they don't

579
00:32:31 --> 00:32:33
much care for that.
 

580
00:32:33 --> 00:32:36
But what are the
rats of NIMH doing?

581
00:32:36 --> 00:32:39
Oh no, they're busy taking
drugs and getting smart, right?

582
00:32:39 --> 00:32:41
Na, Na. they're not sitting
there stimulating their

583
00:32:41 --> 00:32:44
little selves, yeah.
 

584
00:32:44 --> 00:32:44
AUDIENCE: Terminal Man?
 

585
00:32:44 --> 00:32:46
PROFESSOR: Yeah, Terminal
Man, that sounds right.

586
00:32:46 --> 00:32:47
What's Terminal Man's issue?
 

587
00:32:47 --> 00:32:54
AUDIENCE: He has epileptic
fits, [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

588
00:32:54 --> 00:32:55
PROFESSOR: And it does
give him pleasure, yes.

589
00:32:55 --> 00:32:56
OK that's -- yeah.
 

590
00:32:56 --> 00:33:00
AUDIENCE: Flowers for Algernon?
 

591
00:33:00 --> 00:33:01
PROFESSOR: Flowers
for Algernon?

592
00:33:01 --> 00:33:03
No, what's he doing?
 

593
00:33:03 --> 00:33:04
Is he being stimulated?
 

594
00:33:04 --> 00:33:08
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

595
00:33:08 --> 00:33:12
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah, but he just
becomes a super smart rat

596
00:33:12 --> 00:33:15
like the rats of NIMH one.
 

597
00:33:15 --> 00:33:18
He's got a different -- we
don't know how to make super

598
00:33:18 --> 00:33:21
smart rats, we just know how
to make rats who will work

599
00:33:21 --> 00:33:23
hard on pushing levers.
 

600
00:33:23 --> 00:33:27
The Terminal Man one is one
of the sci fi examples

601
00:33:27 --> 00:33:28
that I know about.
 

602
00:33:28 --> 00:33:31
Anyway, look, the critical
issue that gets people writing

603
00:33:31 --> 00:33:34
science fiction stories is,
suppose we did this to a human,

604
00:33:34 --> 00:33:39
would that human, could you
killed somebody by hooking them

605
00:33:39 --> 00:33:44
up to self- stimulate their
pleasure center, and they

606
00:33:44 --> 00:33:45
would kill themselves.
 

607
00:33:45 --> 00:33:47
How would they kill themselves?
 

608
00:33:47 --> 00:33:49
By, you know, sitting
there, oh, oh, oh, and

609
00:33:49 --> 00:33:53
forgetting to eat, right?
 

610
00:33:53 --> 00:33:54
Well nobody's ever done
this in humans of course.

611
00:33:54 --> 00:33:58
It's been done in rats.
 

612
00:33:58 --> 00:34:09
And if you put a lever a lever
that gives food next to a lever

613
00:34:09 --> 00:34:14
the gives stimulation in a good
spot in the rat's brain, the

614
00:34:14 --> 00:34:21
rat will sit there and
work away on the self-

615
00:34:21 --> 00:34:23
stimulation lever.
 

616
00:34:23 --> 00:34:28
And at least in some of these
studies, well, every now and

617
00:34:28 --> 00:34:34
then, sort of, say oh, get a
little food, OK, back over

618
00:34:34 --> 00:34:35
here to the video game stuff.
 

619
00:34:35 --> 00:34:38
This is really good.
 

620
00:34:38 --> 00:34:40
This is what your parents
thought you were doing, right?

621
00:34:40 --> 00:34:42
Yeah, come on down
and eat dinner.

622
00:34:42 --> 00:34:45
Oh, Mom, I can't put
it on pause, yeah.

623
00:34:45 --> 00:34:53
Anyway, the -- would an
animal actually kill itself?

624
00:34:53 --> 00:34:58
Gleitman says that hungry rats
will opt for self- stimulation

625
00:34:58 --> 00:35:00
even though it literally
brings starvation.

626
00:35:00 --> 00:35:06
And then he sites an article
that I went back and read, and

627
00:35:06 --> 00:35:09
the rats in that study didn't
starve themselves to death,

628
00:35:09 --> 00:35:12
because the researchers
wouldn't do it, presumably

629
00:35:12 --> 00:35:15
because it seemed unethical
to actually let a rat

630
00:35:15 --> 00:35:18
starve itself to death.
 

631
00:35:18 --> 00:35:21
But they will certainly reduce,
you know, they'll certainly get

632
00:35:21 --> 00:35:26
themselves pretty hungry while
amusing themselves with the,

633
00:35:26 --> 00:35:27
by stimulating their brain.
 

634
00:35:27 --> 00:35:28
There was a hand up, oh
there still is a hand

635
00:35:28 --> 00:35:29
up there, look at that.
 

636
00:35:29 --> 00:35:37
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].
 

637
00:35:37 --> 00:35:43
PROFESSOR: I don't know that
the truth or falsity -- so the

638
00:35:43 --> 00:35:47
story is a guy played video
games for, what was it, 74

639
00:35:47 --> 00:35:50
straight hours, 74
straight hours in Korea,

640
00:35:50 --> 00:35:52
and then he died.
 

641
00:35:52 --> 00:35:58
Actually the Korea part is
good here, because I have no

642
00:35:58 --> 00:36:00
idea whether this is true
one way or the other.

643
00:36:00 --> 00:36:07
It has all the Hallmarks of
a so- called urban legend.

644
00:36:07 --> 00:36:11
It has a grain of plausability,
and is just sort of one step

645
00:36:11 --> 00:36:13
removed from checkability.
 

646
00:36:13 --> 00:36:18
It's like the Kentucky
Fried breaded rat, right?

647
00:36:18 --> 00:36:22
Everybody knows somebody else
who knows that their cousin

648
00:36:22 --> 00:36:25
got a breaded rat once.
 

649
00:36:25 --> 00:36:27
There are whole books of
these things, they're great.

650
00:36:27 --> 00:36:30
I don't know, maybe somebody
managed to play video

651
00:36:30 --> 00:36:30
games until they died.
 

652
00:36:30 --> 00:36:34
People do all sorts
of stupid things.

653
00:36:34 --> 00:36:38
I don't recommend
trying this yourself.

654
00:36:38 --> 00:36:44
In any case, rats will work
very hard in order to stimulate

655
00:36:44 --> 00:36:45
different parts of their brain.
 

656
00:36:45 --> 00:36:50
What is it that
they're working for?

657
00:36:50 --> 00:36:53
The evidence suggests that
they're not just working for

658
00:36:53 --> 00:36:57
some sort of disembodied
pleasure, but that they're

659
00:36:57 --> 00:37:01
working for the reward
associated with one or the

660
00:37:01 --> 00:37:09
other of sort of basic hard-
wired, innate reward systems,

661
00:37:09 --> 00:37:13
that you come with, but that
the rat comes with too.

662
00:37:13 --> 00:37:20
The reason that in this aspect
of the slavery story, that

663
00:37:20 --> 00:37:27
you'll work to get the fish if
you're the cat is that you came

664
00:37:27 --> 00:37:32
predisposed to think that
hunger is bad and food is good.

665
00:37:32 --> 00:37:34
This, yeah, look, it doesn't
take very sophisticated

666
00:37:34 --> 00:37:36
evolutionary psychological
theory to think this

667
00:37:36 --> 00:37:37
might be a good idea.
 

668
00:37:37 --> 00:37:41
Organisms that went into the
world thinking that hunger is

669
00:37:41 --> 00:37:45
good and food is bad had many
fewer progeny than the ones

670
00:37:45 --> 00:37:48
who thought that hunger
was bad and food was good.

671
00:37:48 --> 00:37:53
So it's not that surprising
that you've got circuitry that

672
00:37:53 --> 00:37:57
says if you're hungry you want
to go and eat something.

673
00:37:57 --> 00:38:01
And the centers that are being
stimulated are in chunks of

674
00:38:01 --> 00:38:05
brain that if you mess with
them, mess with the rat's

675
00:38:05 --> 00:38:08
ability to regulate its eating.
 

676
00:38:08 --> 00:38:11
So there's a wonderful picture
in Gleitman of a rat with a

677
00:38:11 --> 00:38:16
hypothalamic lesion, a lesions
in this sort of chunk of brain.

678
00:38:16 --> 00:38:18
The specific lesion in this
particular rat is in a chunk

679
00:38:18 --> 00:38:20
of brains that seems to
be important in telling

680
00:38:20 --> 00:38:21
you when you're full.
 

681
00:38:21 --> 00:38:23
So this rat never
knows that he's full.

682
00:38:23 --> 00:38:25
With the result, he
just keeps eating.

683
00:38:25 --> 00:38:30
And so there's this picture in
chapter three of a rat on a --

684
00:38:30 --> 00:38:33
some of you may already have
seen it, of a rat on one

685
00:38:33 --> 00:38:35
of those diets scales.
 

686
00:38:35 --> 00:38:37
You know, and he looks
like a fury football.

687
00:38:37 --> 00:38:39
He's just sort of overflowing.
 

688
00:38:39 --> 00:38:43
that's And that's because he's
got a specific lesion in this

689
00:38:43 --> 00:38:45
little specific chunk of brain.
 

690
00:38:45 --> 00:38:47
How do we know that's
what's going on here?

691
00:38:47 --> 00:38:51
Well, you got a rat who's
working a way to be stimulated

692
00:38:51 --> 00:38:53
in this little particular
chunk of brain.

693
00:38:53 --> 00:38:58
And if he, so let's take this
little chunk of brain, if he's

694
00:38:58 --> 00:39:01
a full rat, if you feed him
up, he doesn't work as hard.

695
00:39:01 --> 00:39:03
It's just not as interesting.
 

696
00:39:03 --> 00:39:08
You know this, in your own --
so, you like M&Ms let's say.

697
00:39:08 --> 00:39:11
You're willing to put,
you know, you're willing

698
00:39:11 --> 00:39:13
to push the lever to
get the M&Ms, right?

699
00:39:13 --> 00:39:15
You're willing to put the
quarters in the machine.

700
00:39:15 --> 00:39:17
Would you do that forever?
 

701
00:39:17 --> 00:39:20
No, because eventually you
get full and the M&Ms

702
00:39:20 --> 00:39:22
kind of look disgusting.
 

703
00:39:22 --> 00:39:25
So the same thing happens here.
 

704
00:39:25 --> 00:39:32
So the pleasure that the rat is
getting is modulated by

705
00:39:32 --> 00:39:36
satisfying, you know, the thing
about direct electrical

706
00:39:36 --> 00:39:39
stimulation is it gives the
sensation of the satisfaction

707
00:39:39 --> 00:39:41
without actually
satisfying anything.

708
00:39:41 --> 00:39:44
So, if you're getting the oh,
the M&M is good thing without

709
00:39:44 --> 00:39:47
getting the M&M, you can sit
there, oh the M&M is good

710
00:39:47 --> 00:39:50
forever and ever, and
keep working on it.

711
00:39:50 --> 00:39:52
Okay, so that's this
little chunk of brain.

712
00:39:52 --> 00:39:54
You go over to this other chunk
of brain where the rat will

713
00:39:54 --> 00:39:59
also work hard, and that rat
doesn't care if he's full,

714
00:39:59 --> 00:40:03
that rat cares whether
he's mated recently.

715
00:40:03 --> 00:40:07
So you know, this one is part,
you know, this little chunk of

716
00:40:07 --> 00:40:12
brain is presumably related
to the reward systems having

717
00:40:12 --> 00:40:14
to do with sex and mating.
 

718
00:40:14 --> 00:40:17
Again, it doesn't take an
evolutionary psych genius to

719
00:40:17 --> 00:40:22
figure out that this would be
sensible stuff for a

720
00:40:22 --> 00:40:25
brain to come with.
 

721
00:40:25 --> 00:40:30
Organisms that didn't find
mating rewarding didn't

722
00:40:30 --> 00:40:31
leave many offspring.
 

723
00:40:31 --> 00:40:34
Yeah, just didn't work
out that well for them.

724
00:40:34 --> 00:40:36
And so, you know, there's
another reward system.

725
00:40:36 --> 00:40:42
Similarly, for thirst there
are separate reward systems.

726
00:40:42 --> 00:40:48
OK, so, in some sense you
end up doing stuff in order

727
00:40:48 --> 00:40:51
to light up little pieces
of brain or to turn off

728
00:40:51 --> 00:40:52
little pieces of brain.
 

729
00:40:52 --> 00:40:58
That's the sense in which you
are a slave to your brain.

730
00:40:58 --> 00:41:03
Now, you, know that only
gets you so far, because

731
00:41:03 --> 00:41:04
that's fairly simple.
 

732
00:41:04 --> 00:41:08
You know, eat food, little hunk
of brain says you're happy.

733
00:41:08 --> 00:41:14
Your behavior is somewhat
more complicated than that.

734
00:41:14 --> 00:41:17
How do we get to that more
complicated behavior?

735
00:41:17 --> 00:41:19
Well, let's stick with
the M&M example.

736
00:41:19 --> 00:41:22
How did you get to the M&Ms?
 

737
00:41:22 --> 00:41:26
Well, you got to go down
to the vending machine

738
00:41:26 --> 00:41:27
and put the money in.
 

739
00:41:27 --> 00:41:29
And how do you
learn to do that?

740
00:41:29 --> 00:41:33
Well, maybe you learn to do
that by a chain of associations

741
00:41:33 --> 00:41:34
back to the M&Ms.
 

742
00:41:34 --> 00:41:37
M&Ms, oh, they're good.
 

743
00:41:37 --> 00:41:40
Getting M&Ms becomes
good in its own right.

744
00:41:40 --> 00:41:44
Somebody gives me M&Ms,
that becomes rewarding by

745
00:41:44 --> 00:41:47
association, with the fact that
I will now get to eat the M&Ms.

746
00:41:47 --> 00:41:51
This machine will give me M&Ms,
but only if I give it quarters.

747
00:41:51 --> 00:41:53
So, I learn to
give it quarters.

748
00:41:53 --> 00:41:54
That's an interesting ring.
 

749
00:41:54 --> 00:41:56
It sounded like a
regular old phone.

750
00:41:56 --> 00:41:59
 
 

751
00:41:59 --> 00:42:00
Put them on vibrate.
 

752
00:42:00 --> 00:42:03
That's what I do, because let's
see, well, yeah, it's just

753
00:42:03 --> 00:42:04
about the right time.
 

754
00:42:04 --> 00:42:07
I should be vibrating any
time, woops, not that one.

755
00:42:07 --> 00:42:14
My tenth grader tends to phone
in after school which is great,

756
00:42:14 --> 00:42:16
the only thing is that after
school two days a week turns

757
00:42:16 --> 00:42:22
out to be here, and it's not
a good time to take a call.

758
00:42:22 --> 00:42:26
Anyway so ah well, so the
tenth grader, he likes M&Ms.

759
00:42:26 --> 00:42:28
He needs quarters.
 

760
00:42:28 --> 00:42:33
So, he's got to emit behavior
that I like so I'll give

761
00:42:33 --> 00:42:35
him quarters right?
 

762
00:42:35 --> 00:42:38
And so you can see how you
could build back from a primary

763
00:42:38 --> 00:42:44
sort of reinforcer, like food
is good to something much more

764
00:42:44 --> 00:42:48
remote like cleaning
my room is good.

765
00:42:48 --> 00:42:51
Why is cleaning my room
-- if I clean my room,

766
00:42:51 --> 00:42:52
daddy gives me quarters.
 

767
00:42:52 --> 00:42:54
If daddy give me quarters,
me I take quarters.

768
00:42:54 --> 00:42:55
I put them in machine.
 

769
00:42:55 --> 00:42:58
Machine gives me M&Ms
and all is good.

770
00:42:58 --> 00:43:01
 
 

771
00:43:01 --> 00:43:06
That's OK, but it probably
doesn't do quite well.

772
00:43:06 --> 00:43:11
The brain suggests to us that
that isn't quite enough, for

773
00:43:11 --> 00:43:15
organizing even the feeding
behavior of a complex

774
00:43:15 --> 00:43:17
organism like us.
 

775
00:43:17 --> 00:43:22
Suppose that you are doing --
that what gets you to do your

776
00:43:22 --> 00:43:27
complicated sort of behavior
around feeding is the fact that

777
00:43:27 --> 00:43:29
you're hungry -- oh, chapter
three will tell you all about

778
00:43:29 --> 00:43:32
how you know that
you're hungry.

779
00:43:32 --> 00:43:34
It's lovely sort of
engineering work.

780
00:43:34 --> 00:43:38
You've got little detectors,
receptor is in the blood.

781
00:43:38 --> 00:43:40
They're doing things
like keeping track of

782
00:43:40 --> 00:43:41
blood sugar levels.
 

783
00:43:41 --> 00:43:44
When those levels drop, chunks
of brain become active.

784
00:43:44 --> 00:43:48
Activity there is apparently
aversive, probably

785
00:43:48 --> 00:43:52
corresponding to what you and
I think is hunger.

786
00:43:52 --> 00:43:54
When you get sugar in,
activity there drops.

787
00:43:54 --> 00:43:57
Lovely, beautiful sort
of control systems.

788
00:43:57 --> 00:44:00
Stuff worked out in great
detail and discussed in

789
00:44:00 --> 00:44:07
considerabe detail in chapter
three, but suppose you're not

790
00:44:07 --> 00:44:10
living in your food, right?
 

791
00:44:10 --> 00:44:14
Suppose you're, well suppose
you're like out on the plains

792
00:44:14 --> 00:44:19
of Africa somewhere, and the
M&Ms aren't just sitting over

793
00:44:19 --> 00:44:20
there in the vending machine.
 

794
00:44:20 --> 00:44:22
They're running around, and
you're going to have to

795
00:44:22 --> 00:44:27
hunt them down, right?
 

796
00:44:27 --> 00:44:32
If you are sitting around until
the blood sugar level gets low

797
00:44:32 --> 00:44:35
enough for unpleasant things to
happen in these hard-wired

798
00:44:35 --> 00:44:41
chunks of brain, to make you
think, OK, all right, I'll

799
00:44:41 --> 00:44:44
remember this, M&Ms or
wildebeest s, whichever

800
00:44:44 --> 00:44:46
it was, they're good.
 

801
00:44:46 --> 00:44:48
I can eat them.
 

802
00:44:48 --> 00:44:51
To get to wildebeest , I got to
go clean my room -- anyway,

803
00:44:51 --> 00:44:53
there's some complicated
thing that you gotta do.

804
00:44:53 --> 00:44:58
But if you wait long enough
before starting, you may not

805
00:44:58 --> 00:45:01
get it, the job done
in time, right?

806
00:45:01 --> 00:45:04
It's going to take you a while
to hunt down the wildebeest .

807
00:45:04 --> 00:45:08
If you wait till the gas tank
is almost empty, yeah you may

808
00:45:08 --> 00:45:13
find yourself flat out on the
plains with, you know, no food.

809
00:45:13 --> 00:45:19
So it would be useful if
something got you up and

810
00:45:19 --> 00:45:25
mobilized for activity before
you were actually hungry,

811
00:45:25 --> 00:45:28
before you actually were in
some sort of desperate need.

812
00:45:28 --> 00:45:34
And the distinction that gets
made, and I trust is bolded at

813
00:45:34 --> 00:45:40
the, yes, it's down there at
the bottom of page 2, is

814
00:45:40 --> 00:45:45
the distinction between
consummatory and appetitive

815
00:45:45 --> 00:45:48
behaviors, or consummatory and
appetitive pet motivations.

816
00:45:48 --> 00:45:51
consummatory ones, are the ones
we've been talking about so

817
00:45:51 --> 00:45:53
far, eating M&Ms, that's good.
 

818
00:45:53 --> 00:45:59
Appetitive ones are ones where
the act of looking, if you'd

819
00:45:59 --> 00:46:03
like, or getting yourself in
a position to consume

820
00:46:03 --> 00:46:04
is itself rewarding.
 

821
00:46:04 --> 00:46:08
In that case of food, that
might be sort of the thrill

822
00:46:08 --> 00:46:11
of the hunt kind of thing.
 

823
00:46:11 --> 00:46:14
Think about cat, right, your
cat that likes to jump

824
00:46:14 --> 00:46:15
on anything that moves.
 

825
00:46:15 --> 00:46:16
Why is that?
 

826
00:46:16 --> 00:46:22
It's because the cat is hard
wired to like hunting stuff.

827
00:46:22 --> 00:46:25
It's just fun to grab
stuff and kill it.

828
00:46:25 --> 00:46:31
Now that's a useful thing to do
if you are a cat-like animal

829
00:46:31 --> 00:46:33
because then there's going to
be something around to eat when

830
00:46:33 --> 00:46:36
those blood sugar levels drop
and you need to, you know, chew

831
00:46:36 --> 00:46:37
on a wildebeest for a while.
 

832
00:46:37 --> 00:46:41
And it's pretty clear that we
have similar, actually,

833
00:46:41 --> 00:46:44
it's pretty clear that in
yesterday's political news that

834
00:46:44 --> 00:46:53
we have similar sorts of
circuitry in ourselves.

835
00:46:53 --> 00:46:58
Yesterday the assault rifle,
the assault weapon ban expired.

836
00:46:58 --> 00:47:01
Bush spent a lot of time
not talking about it.

837
00:47:01 --> 00:47:03
Kerry spent a lot of times
saying I'm a hunter.

838
00:47:03 --> 00:47:04
I love to hunt.
 

839
00:47:04 --> 00:47:07
I love to jump on moving things
and stuff like that, but I've

840
00:47:07 --> 00:47:08
never done it with
an assault weapon.

841
00:47:08 --> 00:47:13
You don't need to use an -- he
was on the -- but he was very

842
00:47:13 --> 00:47:17
big on pointing out that he
loves to hunt, because

843
00:47:17 --> 00:47:19
apparently there's lots of
people who love to hunt and go

844
00:47:19 --> 00:47:24
out and you know, shoot things
and sometimes eat things.

845
00:47:24 --> 00:47:29
This is presumably related to,
this is presumably a form of

846
00:47:29 --> 00:47:32
appetitive behavior in humans.
 

847
00:47:32 --> 00:47:34
If you don't happen to love
to hunt it doesn't mean

848
00:47:34 --> 00:47:37
that you're missing a
piece of your brain.

849
00:47:37 --> 00:47:44
Another realm where appetitive
behavior is important is in

850
00:47:44 --> 00:47:48
the sex and romance
department, right?

851
00:47:48 --> 00:47:56
If it were not the case that
the act of looking up for a

852
00:47:56 --> 00:48:03
mate is motivating in its own
right, well, what are you going

853
00:48:03 --> 00:48:06
to do, you know, wait around
until all of a sudden, I don't

854
00:48:06 --> 00:48:08
know, whatever levels it is
drops low enough, ugh,

855
00:48:08 --> 00:48:12
it's time to mate?
 

856
00:48:12 --> 00:48:15
It's just not the way we
organize our, it's not the way

857
00:48:15 --> 00:48:19
we organize our behavior.
 

858
00:48:19 --> 00:48:24
Our social lives suggest that
we find a degree of pleasure

859
00:48:24 --> 00:48:30
in the appetitive aspects of
seeking a mate, not merely in

860
00:48:30 --> 00:48:33
the consummatory parts of it.
 

861
00:48:33 --> 00:48:43
So you come with a set of
motivations that get you

862
00:48:43 --> 00:48:47
motivation, in the sense of
getting you to move, that seem

863
00:48:47 --> 00:48:49
to come with the systems.
 

864
00:48:49 --> 00:48:55
These can be quite specific --
by the way, that's the notion

865
00:48:55 --> 00:48:58
of preparedness that I see,
what is related to this notion

866
00:48:58 --> 00:49:00
of preparedness that I see is
actually above where it says

867
00:49:00 --> 00:49:09
consummatory and appetitive
behaviors on the handout.

868
00:49:09 --> 00:49:18
you are surprisingly fine
tuned by, presumably by the

869
00:49:18 --> 00:49:20
history of the species.
 

870
00:49:20 --> 00:49:28
So for instance, you are built
to get away from scary things

871
00:49:28 --> 00:49:33
that are going to hurt you and
that seems reasonable enough.

872
00:49:33 --> 00:49:36
And that can be specific enough
to the point that it's easier

873
00:49:36 --> 00:49:40
to get you to be scared of
spiders and snakes than it

874
00:49:40 --> 00:49:44
is to get you to be scared
of bunnies and chickens.

875
00:49:44 --> 00:49:46
That sounds kind of obvious,
but there's no obvious reason

876
00:49:46 --> 00:49:49
why, in fact, one of the famous
experiments in the sort of

877
00:49:49 --> 00:49:53
behaviorists tradition has a
little baby known to history as

878
00:49:53 --> 00:49:56
Little Albert -- there's a
great film from the 20's of

879
00:49:56 --> 00:49:58
this Little Albert is sitting
there, he's playing with

880
00:49:58 --> 00:50:00
a little white bunny.
 

881
00:50:00 --> 00:50:03
John Watson, founder of
American behaviors, then sneaks

882
00:50:03 --> 00:50:09
up behind Little Albert with a
gong and pow, rings the gong.

883
00:50:09 --> 00:50:12
Little Albert goes, if it was a
cartoon, would go straight up

884
00:50:12 --> 00:50:15
in the air, and is you know,
scared out of his Little Albert

885
00:50:15 --> 00:50:21
gourd and is screaming and
crying and stuff like that, and

886
00:50:21 --> 00:50:25
you know, it's kind of harsh
for Little Albert, but then you

887
00:50:25 --> 00:50:28
bring Albert back and show
him the bunny again.

888
00:50:28 --> 00:50:30
Does he want to play
with the bunny?

889
00:50:30 --> 00:50:31
No.
 

890
00:50:31 --> 00:50:33
Does he want to play with
anything that's white and

891
00:50:33 --> 00:50:36
furry, including Santa Claus,
apparently, I seem to recall.

892
00:50:36 --> 00:50:39
Guys with bushy white beards
-- he recovered by the way.

893
00:50:39 --> 00:50:43
He didn't grow up to be a
psycho or anything, but you can

894
00:50:43 --> 00:50:46
train, so you can you can train
somebody to be scared of

895
00:50:46 --> 00:50:50
rabbits, but it's easier to
train them to be scared of

896
00:50:50 --> 00:50:54
snakes, at if they were
prepared by the history of the

897
00:50:54 --> 00:51:05
species to be scared of things
like snakes and spiders.

898
00:51:05 --> 00:51:11
OK, so you're a slave to the
environment because your brain

899
00:51:11 --> 00:51:16
responds in rather specific
ways to the environment but you

900
00:51:16 --> 00:51:24
are a lot more complicated than
that, or at least you feel like

901
00:51:24 --> 00:51:27
you're a lot more complicated
than something that's just a

902
00:51:27 --> 00:51:31
bundle of sort of engineering
responses to glucose level

903
00:51:31 --> 00:51:35
low, must go find wildebeest.
 

904
00:51:35 --> 00:51:38
And I want to spend the
remainder of the lecture

905
00:51:38 --> 00:51:42
talking about some of those
complexities, but first I want

906
00:51:42 --> 00:51:47
to give everybody a chance at
least to stand up and stretch a

907
00:51:47 --> 00:51:49
little bit and fan themselves
because it's warm in here.

908
00:51:49 --> 00:51:57
 
 

909
00:51:57 --> 00:52:32
I Oh, yes, yes you want your
little form right now?

910
00:52:32 --> 00:52:33
AUDIENCE: Sure.
 

911
00:52:33 --> 00:52:37
PROFESSOR: Ok send this form
back, and I trust that means

912
00:52:37 --> 00:52:40
that you can be here at
like five of two --

913
00:52:40 --> 00:52:40
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

914
00:52:40 --> 00:52:44
PROFESSOR: Yes, well, it's
not useful after class.

915
00:52:44 --> 00:52:46
OK this is all the
information I have.

916
00:52:46 --> 00:52:48
If there's a problem
let me know.

917
00:52:48 --> 00:52:50
And your name is?
 

918
00:52:50 --> 00:52:51
AUDIENCE: Jean.
 

919
00:52:51 --> 00:52:52
PROFESSOR: Jean, nice to meet
you, and I trust that you'll

920
00:52:52 --> 00:52:57
see happily erasing my boards.
 

921
00:52:57 --> 00:53:01
OK, let us reconvene here.
 

922
00:53:01 --> 00:53:07
Here's the deal.
 

923
00:53:07 --> 00:53:17
I will typically try to be good
and remember to give you a

924
00:53:17 --> 00:53:22
chance to sort of stretch your
limbs a little bit, and, but

925
00:53:22 --> 00:53:24
it'll be a short stretch.
 

926
00:53:24 --> 00:53:27
So, you know, but why
am I telling you this?

927
00:53:27 --> 00:53:29
It's the guys who thought they
were off for ten minutes who

928
00:53:29 --> 00:53:31
are now halfway down the hall
to get the M&Ms who had

929
00:53:31 --> 00:53:34
the problem, but anyway.
 

930
00:53:34 --> 00:53:36
Or the ones who are out
looking for wildebeest

931
00:53:36 --> 00:53:37
are really in trouble.
 

932
00:53:37 --> 00:53:40
 
 

933
00:53:40 --> 00:53:44
You might wonder what
the role of the emotion

934
00:53:44 --> 00:53:45
is in all of this.
 

935
00:53:45 --> 00:53:48
Clearly, motivation and
emotion are closely related.

936
00:53:48 --> 00:53:52
They both talk about feeling a
lot, you know, that there's

937
00:53:52 --> 00:54:03
this feeling of hunger, but the
emotion part is well, one way

938
00:54:03 --> 00:54:07
to think of it would be as a
sort of a language, a symbol

939
00:54:07 --> 00:54:14
system, that's a short hand
that helps you mobilize you, a

940
00:54:14 --> 00:54:18
way of talking to yourself
about what resources you

941
00:54:18 --> 00:54:18
might want to mobilize.
 

942
00:54:18 --> 00:54:21
Oh, I feel fear.
 

943
00:54:21 --> 00:54:27
That means I should do the
following sorts of things.

944
00:54:27 --> 00:54:30
And it helps you generalize
from event to event.

945
00:54:30 --> 00:54:32
I feel fear now.
 

946
00:54:32 --> 00:54:34
I felt fear before.
 

947
00:54:34 --> 00:54:36
You know, maybe there's some
sort of relationship that

948
00:54:36 --> 00:54:41
I ought to be noticing.
 

949
00:54:41 --> 00:54:46
And perhaps, one of its most
important uses is as a form of

950
00:54:46 --> 00:54:52
communication between people or
between animals more generally.

951
00:54:52 --> 00:54:54
If I am afraid, let's go let's
go back to the plains of

952
00:54:54 --> 00:54:57
Africa and switch sides.
 

953
00:54:57 --> 00:55:02
If I'm a wildebeest, and I
see the leopard over there,

954
00:55:02 --> 00:55:07
stalking through the under
brush, I should be afraid.

955
00:55:07 --> 00:55:09
If you're not seeing the
leopard, but you're seeing me,

956
00:55:09 --> 00:55:12
I look afraid, and you're the
rest of the wildebeests,

957
00:55:12 --> 00:55:14
you should be afraid too.
 

958
00:55:14 --> 00:55:19
It's a good idea if you pick
up on the way that I feel.

959
00:55:19 --> 00:55:26
Now we tend to devalue that a
bit because we tend to use

960
00:55:26 --> 00:55:31
verbal communication a lot to
convey information back and

961
00:55:31 --> 00:55:33
forth, and for some things
it's obviously a much

962
00:55:33 --> 00:55:36
more useful technique.
 

963
00:55:36 --> 00:55:39
I mean trying to teach
psychology by a set of

964
00:55:39 --> 00:55:44
emotional expressions would not
-- I can't even conceive of how

965
00:55:44 --> 00:55:46
I would go about doing that.
 

966
00:55:46 --> 00:55:52
However, we probably over value
the straight, this sort of

967
00:55:52 --> 00:55:55
straight verbal nature of
communications, even

968
00:55:55 --> 00:55:55
between humans.
 

969
00:55:55 --> 00:55:58
Obviously, non-verbal animals
are going to have to use some

970
00:55:58 --> 00:56:02
other form of communication,
but even among humans, we

971
00:56:02 --> 00:56:08
underrate the value of
this current of emotion

972
00:56:08 --> 00:56:10
information transmission.
 

973
00:56:10 --> 00:56:19
Perhaps the clearest example of
this is email, where, how many

974
00:56:19 --> 00:56:24
of you at some point have
gotten into trouble on email,

975
00:56:24 --> 00:56:29
because email has the
characteristics of conversation

976
00:56:29 --> 00:56:33
without the tone of voice.
 

977
00:56:33 --> 00:56:37
You said something that you
thought, that you meant

978
00:56:37 --> 00:56:41
sarcastically, or you thought
was funny, and somebody else

979
00:56:41 --> 00:56:46
read it as flat prose, and
they were not amused at all.

980
00:56:46 --> 00:56:53
And then you got -- actually
that's the root of all these

981
00:56:53 --> 00:56:55
little smiley faces and
all these symbols that I

982
00:56:55 --> 00:56:58
don't know from nothing.
 

983
00:56:58 --> 00:56:59
You all know this.
 

984
00:56:59 --> 00:57:01
There's some very elaborate
vocabulary of basically

985
00:57:01 --> 00:57:09
emotional tokens for instant
messaging or for email because

986
00:57:09 --> 00:57:13
it lacks that emotional tone of
voice, and without that,

987
00:57:13 --> 00:57:18
the quality of the
communication goes down.

988
00:57:18 --> 00:57:21
 
 

989
00:57:21 --> 00:57:28
So you've got emotions at sort
of a super ordinate language

990
00:57:28 --> 00:57:32
that allows you to talk about
motivational states, even in

991
00:57:32 --> 00:57:34
the absence of any sort
of verbal language.

992
00:57:34 --> 00:57:38
I think you could probably make
a convincing argument that

993
00:57:38 --> 00:57:44
basic motivational states exist
in very, very simple organisms.

994
00:57:44 --> 00:57:49
I mean any organism has to
figure out, has to have in some

995
00:57:49 --> 00:57:53
sense the motivation to feed
itself and to reproduce.

996
00:57:53 --> 00:57:56
It's only when you get to more
elaborate organisms do you get

997
00:57:56 --> 00:58:00
something that looks like the
sort of emotional life that you

998
00:58:00 --> 00:58:04
and I might have, where it's
being used, as a sense, a

999
00:58:04 --> 00:58:05
form of communication.
 

1000
00:58:05 --> 00:58:12
But look, so far, we're still
in pretty simple terms here.

1001
00:58:12 --> 00:58:15
You know, we've got, sex
and reproduction is good.

1002
00:58:15 --> 00:58:19
Getting eaten by the leopard,
that's bad, and so on.

1003
00:58:19 --> 00:58:24
Where we want to get, and where
the chapter on motivation, for

1004
00:58:24 --> 00:58:29
instance, never gets, is you
know, sex and reproduction,

1005
00:58:29 --> 00:58:32
good, eternal damnation, bad.
 

1006
00:58:32 --> 00:58:33
Or something like that.
 

1007
00:58:33 --> 00:58:36
Or how do you get from, you
know, hunger drives and sex

1008
00:58:36 --> 00:58:41
drives to thou shall not murder
and you know, I want to grow up

1009
00:58:41 --> 00:58:46
to be a chemical engineer,
or something like that.

1010
00:58:46 --> 00:58:51
It's those rather more
complicated motivations that

1011
00:58:51 --> 00:58:58
require more than just feedback
loops and the lateral

1012
00:58:58 --> 00:59:02
hypothalamus to
make a good story.

1013
00:59:02 --> 00:59:10
Now, one step to a richer
account of why we do

1014
00:59:10 --> 00:59:14
anything is to broaden
the set of motivations.

1015
00:59:14 --> 00:59:23
I have pointed already in the
direction of one act of

1016
00:59:23 --> 00:59:29
broadening that set, and that
is this notion that if I'm a

1017
00:59:29 --> 00:59:31
frightened wildebeest, you
should be a frightened

1018
00:59:31 --> 00:59:32
wildebeest.
 

1019
00:59:32 --> 00:59:35
This is the notion that
emotions are catching

1020
00:59:35 --> 00:59:37
across individuals.
 

1021
00:59:37 --> 00:59:42
We talk about, on the handout I
put it as empathy and described

1022
00:59:42 --> 00:59:53
it as a social emotion, and
it's a social emotion in the

1023
00:59:53 --> 00:59:59
sense that it helps to organize
social behavior, interactions

1024
00:59:59 --> 01:00:01
between people.
 

1025
01:00:01 --> 01:00:07
So, for example, well let's
start with a bit of evidence

1026
01:00:07 --> 01:00:10
that this comes with the
system, that it's not

1027
01:00:10 --> 01:00:13
something, I mean you spend a
fair amount of time trying to

1028
01:00:13 --> 01:00:16
teach people to be more
empathic, but the core of it

1029
01:00:16 --> 01:00:17
is there from the start.
 

1030
01:00:17 --> 01:00:19
So, how do you know it's
there from the start?

1031
01:00:19 --> 01:00:23
You take a baby, here's a baby,
here's a bunch of other babies.

1032
01:00:23 --> 01:00:24
Poke this baby.
 

1033
01:00:24 --> 01:00:26
What's this baby do?
 

1034
01:00:26 --> 01:00:27
AUDIENCE: Cry.
 

1035
01:00:27 --> 01:00:27
PROFESSOR: Cry.
 

1036
01:00:27 --> 01:00:29
What do these babies do?
 

1037
01:00:29 --> 01:00:31
They also cry.
 

1038
01:00:31 --> 01:00:31
Why?
 

1039
01:00:31 --> 01:00:34
You haven't hurt those babies,
but those babies have, in a

1040
01:00:34 --> 01:00:41
sense, caught the emotional
state of the other baby.

1041
01:00:41 --> 01:00:45
Not only do babies catch their
emotional, each other's

1042
01:00:45 --> 01:00:55
emotional states, but you are
all here today because of the

1043
01:00:55 --> 01:00:57
same sort of empathic reaction.
 

1044
01:00:57 --> 01:01:03
When you were a little
pre-verbal slug, and you were

1045
01:01:03 --> 01:01:07
hungry, what did you do?
 

1046
01:01:07 --> 01:01:07
AUDIENCE: Cried.
 

1047
01:01:07 --> 01:01:09
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right,
you cried, right, is

1048
01:01:09 --> 01:01:11
all you could do.
 

1049
01:01:11 --> 01:01:14
And how did that make
your parents feel?

1050
01:01:14 --> 01:01:17
 
 

1051
01:01:17 --> 01:01:20
Well, some of you are here
today because you were lucky

1052
01:01:20 --> 01:01:24
because apparently it made your
parents feel angry, and then --

1053
01:01:24 --> 01:01:28
which it probably did,
particularly at weird hours --

1054
01:01:28 --> 01:01:30
Mara is looking at me.
 

1055
01:01:30 --> 01:01:31
How old is the kid?
 

1056
01:01:31 --> 01:01:33
AUDIENCE:
Four-and-a-half months.

1057
01:01:33 --> 01:01:33
PROFESSOR:
Four-and-a-half months.

1058
01:01:33 --> 01:01:37
We can check out -- if you
haven't met Mara, she's the

1059
01:01:37 --> 01:01:40
head TA, so she knows
everything about the course and

1060
01:01:40 --> 01:01:44
what recitation you're in, and
we can also use her all-term as

1061
01:01:44 --> 01:01:48
the official parent person, or
at least parent of young

1062
01:01:48 --> 01:01:52
child type person.
 

1063
01:01:52 --> 01:01:56
She will confirm that when
you're baby cries, you want to

1064
01:01:56 --> 01:01:58
make that baby stop crying.
 

1065
01:01:58 --> 01:02:02
Fortunately, most parents, the
ones who want their genes to

1066
01:02:02 --> 01:02:06
make it into the next m make
the baby stop crying by doing

1067
01:02:06 --> 01:02:09
things like feeding it
and changing it and

1068
01:02:09 --> 01:02:10
stuff like that.
 

1069
01:02:10 --> 01:02:15
If it didn't make you feel bad,
if the crying baby wasn't

1070
01:02:15 --> 01:02:20
the car alarm of the
developmental world.

1071
01:02:20 --> 01:02:21
Hey, the baby is crying.
 

1072
01:02:21 --> 01:02:24
Oh, that's cool, you know?
 

1073
01:02:24 --> 01:02:26
Didn't know the baby
could make that noise.

1074
01:02:26 --> 01:02:30
Wonder what happens in a
little -- the baby cries,

1075
01:02:30 --> 01:02:34
you feel bad, and you
doing something about it.

1076
01:02:34 --> 01:02:41
And, you know, that's how you
end up getting there, getting

1077
01:02:41 --> 01:02:46
to the point where you can take
care of yourself, because

1078
01:02:46 --> 01:02:50
somebody else was willing to
take care of you at that point.

1079
01:02:50 --> 01:02:54
And obviously, again, in
non-verbal animals, like the

1080
01:02:54 --> 01:03:01
rest of them, it's really
useful if, when your infant

1081
01:03:01 --> 01:03:04
animal is feeling
uncomfortable, you recognize

1082
01:03:04 --> 01:03:07
the need in some fashion
and you and you do

1083
01:03:07 --> 01:03:07
something about it.
 

1084
01:03:07 --> 01:03:10
So in a sense, emphathy is
sort of a prerequisite

1085
01:03:10 --> 01:03:15
for successful parenting.
 

1086
01:03:15 --> 01:03:20
And this empathic catching
of fear is a useful way

1087
01:03:20 --> 01:03:21
to keep yourself alive.
 

1088
01:03:21 --> 01:03:25
If you don't see the danger,
but somebody else does, that's

1089
01:03:25 --> 01:03:30
-- oh, and it's a good,
it's good for keeping you

1090
01:03:30 --> 01:03:32
alive in other ways too.
 

1091
01:03:32 --> 01:03:38
I won't do it, but if I were to
suddenly decide to make myself

1092
01:03:38 --> 01:03:43
throw-up, a bunch of you would
feel really lousy, right?

1093
01:03:43 --> 01:03:44
You know this.
 

1094
01:03:44 --> 01:03:46
By the way, this is one
that goes away when

1095
01:03:46 --> 01:03:47
you become a parent.
 

1096
01:03:47 --> 01:03:50
You can modulate these
things over -- if you felt

1097
01:03:50 --> 01:03:54
incapacitatedly nauseous every
time your child threw-up, your

1098
01:03:54 --> 01:03:57
child would never make it,
because -- you just got

1099
01:03:57 --> 01:03:59
to deal and clean up.
 

1100
01:03:59 --> 01:04:03
But at this point, if I throw
up, you're going to feel sick.

1101
01:04:03 --> 01:04:04
Some of you will throw up.
 

1102
01:04:04 --> 01:04:06
I shouldn't keep talking about
it because some of you will

1103
01:04:06 --> 01:04:09
start feeling gross just
thinking about it.

1104
01:04:09 --> 01:04:10
That's also useful.
 

1105
01:04:10 --> 01:04:11
Why?
 

1106
01:04:11 --> 01:04:14
Because if I ate the
wildebeest, and it was a bad

1107
01:04:14 --> 01:04:18
wildebeest, you know, and we're
all vultures on the same

1108
01:04:18 --> 01:04:22
wildebeest here, if I'm looking
kind of sick, you might as well

1109
01:04:22 --> 01:04:24
get rid of wildebeest now,
because it's just not going to

1110
01:04:24 --> 01:04:26
be doing you any good.
 

1111
01:04:26 --> 01:04:32
So this catching businesses
has its utility.

1112
01:04:32 --> 01:04:35
Now it's not uniformly a good
thing, because you can catch

1113
01:04:35 --> 01:04:38
anti- social emotions just
the way you can catch

1114
01:04:38 --> 01:04:40
pro- social emotions.
 

1115
01:04:40 --> 01:04:44
So when you see seemingly
incomprehensible events, like

1116
01:04:44 --> 01:04:48
how in the world can you
explain something like gang

1117
01:04:48 --> 01:04:54
rape or a massacre
in a war zone?

1118
01:04:54 --> 01:04:59
Part of what's going on
there is the same sort

1119
01:04:59 --> 01:05:00
of emotional contagion.
 

1120
01:05:00 --> 01:05:07
If one person is in a murderous
rage, people around them,

1121
01:05:07 --> 01:05:09
around that person, can catch
the murderous rage, just

1122
01:05:09 --> 01:05:14
the way they can catch the
fear or catch the nausea.

1123
01:05:14 --> 01:05:23
It's not just sort of a pro
social motivation, but empathy

1124
01:05:23 --> 01:05:27
does serve the function of
organizing larger scale

1125
01:05:27 --> 01:05:30
sorts of behavior.
 

1126
01:05:30 --> 01:05:33
Oh, now, how does this
contagion actually work?

1127
01:05:33 --> 01:05:35
How does emotional
contagion actually work?

1128
01:05:35 --> 01:05:39
Interestingly, part of, the
sort of reflexive mechanism

1129
01:05:39 --> 01:05:44
of it seems to be that when
you read my emotion, you

1130
01:05:44 --> 01:05:47
also mimic my emotion.
 

1131
01:05:47 --> 01:05:49
It is most clearly seen
with facial expression.

1132
01:05:49 --> 01:05:53
If I smile at you,
you will smile.

1133
01:05:53 --> 01:05:56
You may not smile much, but I'd
be able to pick up, if I was

1134
01:05:56 --> 01:06:00
recording from your facial
muscles, I would be able to

1135
01:06:00 --> 01:06:06
pick up a transient smile
flitting across your face.

1136
01:06:06 --> 01:06:07
Why is that important?
 

1137
01:06:07 --> 01:06:12
Well how do you know
if you are happy?

1138
01:06:12 --> 01:06:17
Well, it turns out -- and this
is, one of the senses in which

1139
01:06:17 --> 01:06:21
feelings, emotions our feelings
is that you go out and

1140
01:06:21 --> 01:06:27
you feel yourself and ask
yourself, how do I feel?

1141
01:06:27 --> 01:06:30
Part of that is to feel
your face, in effect.

1142
01:06:30 --> 01:06:32
You know, how does
my face feel?

1143
01:06:32 --> 01:06:34
Well, I seem to be smiling.
 

1144
01:06:34 --> 01:06:35
Why would I be smiling?
 

1145
01:06:35 --> 01:06:39
I must be smiling because I
feel good because only dumb

1146
01:06:39 --> 01:06:41
people smile when they're
miserable, right.

1147
01:06:41 --> 01:06:44
You know, well, there are
various social circumstances

1148
01:06:44 --> 01:06:48
when you might do that, but
anyway, it's useful

1149
01:06:48 --> 01:06:49
information.
 

1150
01:06:49 --> 01:06:52
You can actually try to
demonstrate this -- here's an

1151
01:06:52 --> 01:06:57
exercise for the reader if you
like, I've done it as one of

1152
01:06:57 --> 01:07:00
the writing assignments for the
course in various years.

1153
01:07:00 --> 01:07:01
It's sort of fun.
 

1154
01:07:01 --> 01:07:05
Take say ten events of about
the same duration, say an hour,

1155
01:07:05 --> 01:07:10
because that works for a
lecture, for example, now a

1156
01:07:10 --> 01:07:15
lecture, recitation, dinner, a
few events, study break,

1157
01:07:15 --> 01:07:17
events that are going
to take about an hour.

1158
01:07:17 --> 01:07:18
Take ten of them.
 

1159
01:07:18 --> 01:07:19
Shuffle them around.
 

1160
01:07:19 --> 01:07:21
Put five of them in one
pile randomly, put five

1161
01:07:21 --> 01:07:23
in the other pile.
 

1162
01:07:23 --> 01:07:28
Then deliberately either try to
smile or frown through, you

1163
01:07:28 --> 01:07:32
know, smile through pile A
and frown through pile B.

1164
01:07:32 --> 01:07:35
And ask yourself, you can
ask yourself a variety of

1165
01:07:35 --> 01:07:39
questions, the most obvious
being, how do I feel, and

1166
01:07:39 --> 01:07:42
what's the effect on
people around me?

1167
01:07:42 --> 01:07:50
If you frown like an idiot, the
effect may be to make people

1168
01:07:50 --> 01:07:54
smile, but if you, but you know
what you, you've done

1169
01:07:54 --> 01:07:55
the experiment.
 

1170
01:07:55 --> 01:07:58
You were doing it like when you
were early adolescences is one

1171
01:07:58 --> 01:08:00
of the best times to do this
particular experiment.

1172
01:08:00 --> 01:08:02
You show up at the
dinner table.

1173
01:08:02 --> 01:08:07
Everybody's in a pretty
good mood, but you're not.

1174
01:08:07 --> 01:08:11
By the end of the meal, you
know that nobody's in a

1175
01:08:11 --> 01:08:13
good mood anymore, right?
 

1176
01:08:13 --> 01:08:15
Well, you can still do this.
 

1177
01:08:15 --> 01:08:17
I mean I'm not sure how ethical
it is as an experiment to try

1178
01:08:17 --> 01:08:21
out on your friends at dinner
tonight, but it you go to

1179
01:08:21 --> 01:08:26
dinner feeling like junk and
acting that way, you can make

1180
01:08:26 --> 01:08:29
everybody else miserable
too, and isn't that great?

1181
01:08:29 --> 01:08:33
But more to the point, for the
present point, you can make

1182
01:08:33 --> 01:08:37
your -- all that's sappy
garbage about a smile is your

1183
01:08:37 --> 01:08:40
umbrella turn out to
be sort of true.

1184
01:08:40 --> 01:08:43
And it doesn't even have
to be a real smile.

1185
01:08:43 --> 01:08:45
If you take, no that's
somebody else's pen.

1186
01:08:45 --> 01:08:47
I'm not going to do it
with somebody else's pen.

1187
01:08:47 --> 01:08:49
If you take a pen, this is an
experiment that was published a

1188
01:08:49 --> 01:08:55
few years ago, take a pen and
hold it like this, that forces

1189
01:08:55 --> 01:09:02
your face into sort of an idiot
smile, whereas holding a

1190
01:09:02 --> 01:09:04
pen like this does not.
 

1191
01:09:04 --> 01:09:07
It forces, it actually forces
into a bit of a frown.

1192
01:09:07 --> 01:09:10
If you do this, and don't --
I'm already spoiling the

1193
01:09:10 --> 01:09:11
control aspect of
the experiment.

1194
01:09:11 --> 01:09:14
You don't tell people
why they're doing this.

1195
01:09:14 --> 01:09:16
You just make them
do it for awhile.

1196
01:09:16 --> 01:09:23
The people who do this feel
better than the people who do

1197
01:09:23 --> 01:09:25
this, because the chunks of
your brain that are saying, how

1198
01:09:25 --> 01:09:30
do I feel, are rolled up and
encapsulated enough that they

1199
01:09:30 --> 01:09:33
don't know, he's smiling,
he must feel good.

1200
01:09:33 --> 01:09:36
The fact that he's smiling
because he's got a pen in his

1201
01:09:36 --> 01:09:39
mouth turns out -- not that it
matters, but it doesn't

1202
01:09:39 --> 01:09:40
matter that much.
 

1203
01:09:40 --> 01:09:42
So if you're feeling down,
bit on a pen, you'll feel

1204
01:09:42 --> 01:09:43
much better about it.
 

1205
01:09:43 --> 01:09:47
 
 

1206
01:09:47 --> 01:09:52
OK, well look, so you can get a
certain amount of work done by

1207
01:09:52 --> 01:09:58
broadening the set of available
emotions, available motivations

1208
01:09:58 --> 01:10:01
that you want to talk about.
 

1209
01:10:01 --> 01:10:04
Why isn't the world
a better place?

1210
01:10:04 --> 01:10:07
You've got this empathy
thing going on.

1211
01:10:07 --> 01:10:09
You've got this beautifully
wired up brain that you're a

1212
01:10:09 --> 01:10:13
slave to that's designed to
make you eat and mate and do

1213
01:10:13 --> 01:10:14
all those sort of good things.
 

1214
01:10:14 --> 01:10:16
Why isn't the world
a better place?

1215
01:10:16 --> 01:10:19
Why doesn't it work better?
 

1216
01:10:19 --> 01:10:21
I point, look, I can't solve
that in the remaining

1217
01:10:21 --> 01:10:22
12 minutes or so.
 

1218
01:10:22 --> 01:10:26
I pointed to part of the answer
just because you catch emotions

1219
01:10:26 --> 01:10:28
doesn't necessarily mean
you catch good ones.

1220
01:10:28 --> 01:10:32
It is also the case that not
all of your motivations

1221
01:10:32 --> 01:10:34
may be entirely benign.
 

1222
01:10:34 --> 01:10:37
So, for example, what's
it got on the handout?

1223
01:10:37 --> 01:10:45
It doesn't have on the handout,
but aggression seems to be,

1224
01:10:45 --> 01:10:49
there seems to have deep
biological roots to it.

1225
01:10:49 --> 01:10:55
It is a not unreasonable
reaction to a world

1226
01:10:55 --> 01:10:57
of limited resources.
 

1227
01:10:57 --> 01:10:59
It's not necessarily a nice
reaction to a world of limited

1228
01:10:59 --> 01:11:06
resources, but, you know, if
you are, if there's a limited

1229
01:11:06 --> 01:11:13
number of mates out there, and
you can punch out all the other

1230
01:11:13 --> 01:11:20
guys and grab all the women,
well, then you get the have

1231
01:11:20 --> 01:11:24
more progney than the
guys you punched out.

1232
01:11:24 --> 01:11:26
Fortunately human society
is not organized

1233
01:11:26 --> 01:11:27
particularly that way.
 

1234
01:11:27 --> 01:11:30
But there are plenty of animal
societies that seem to be,

1235
01:11:30 --> 01:11:35
elephant seals, you've seen
these guys on, you know, your

1236
01:11:35 --> 01:11:37
favorite cable channel, right?
 

1237
01:11:37 --> 01:11:42
They come up in thousands on
the beaches near Antarctica and

1238
01:11:42 --> 01:11:45
stuff, and, you know, these
huge male guy elephant seals

1239
01:11:45 --> 01:11:50
have like a thousand women --
what is a woman elephant seal?

1240
01:11:50 --> 01:11:50
I don't know.
 

1241
01:11:50 --> 01:11:54
Anyway, a thousand female
elephant seals in their harem,

1242
01:11:54 --> 01:11:57
and they have these huge fights
over who gets to have a --

1243
01:11:57 --> 01:11:59
you know, they can't share.
 

1244
01:11:59 --> 01:12:00
They just never went to
preschool and learned

1245
01:12:00 --> 01:12:02
how to share properly.
 

1246
01:12:02 --> 01:12:06
But part of, there is certainly
enough aggression in human

1247
01:12:06 --> 01:12:10
behavior to make it clear that
that sort of a motivational

1248
01:12:10 --> 01:12:14
system is going to lead to a
certain amount of conflict in

1249
01:12:14 --> 01:12:16
the world, and it's not all
going to work out as

1250
01:12:16 --> 01:12:18
sweetness and light.
 

1251
01:12:18 --> 01:12:21
People like Freud proposed that
there was actually a death

1252
01:12:21 --> 01:12:23
wish motivation out there.
 

1253
01:12:23 --> 01:12:29
Thanatos Freud's term.
 

1254
01:12:29 --> 01:12:33
I might talk about that
more later in the term.

1255
01:12:33 --> 01:12:37
So that's, the possibility that
there are motivations that

1256
01:12:37 --> 01:12:41
themselves are not particularly
nice, if you like, is one

1257
01:12:41 --> 01:12:46
possible reason that the world
is not a perfect place.

1258
01:12:46 --> 01:12:51
But perhaps the most useful way
of understanding why the world

1259
01:12:51 --> 01:12:55
doesn't work out so well,
necessarily, given all this

1260
01:12:55 --> 01:13:02
marvelous motivational hardware
if you like that you've got is

1261
01:13:02 --> 01:13:06
that, look, most of the time
when we study these things, we

1262
01:13:06 --> 01:13:08
study a motivation
in isolation.

1263
01:13:08 --> 01:13:11
You want to study this cat's
ability to learn about the

1264
01:13:11 --> 01:13:15
puzzle box and the relation
to the motivation of hunger,

1265
01:13:15 --> 01:13:17
you take a hungry cat.
 

1266
01:13:17 --> 01:13:18
You put it in a box.
 

1267
01:13:18 --> 01:13:20
The only thing of any interest
here is how to get out of

1268
01:13:20 --> 01:13:22
the box and get to the fish.
 

1269
01:13:22 --> 01:13:26
You know, the only thing of
interest here is, you know,

1270
01:13:26 --> 01:13:28
there's a rat who is
maybe a hungry rat.

1271
01:13:28 --> 01:13:30
In this case, he's got an
electrode now in the feeding

1272
01:13:30 --> 01:13:32
centers of his brain.
 

1273
01:13:32 --> 01:13:35
And all the other things that
a rat might do are just

1274
01:13:35 --> 01:13:37
not relevant here.
 

1275
01:13:37 --> 01:13:39
You don't operate in
the world like that.

1276
01:13:39 --> 01:13:43
You operate in a much
more complicated space.

1277
01:13:43 --> 01:13:46
I mean we can
cartoon that here.

1278
01:13:46 --> 01:13:48
Here's you.
 

1279
01:13:48 --> 01:13:53
You know, if we got in the lab,
maybe we can just do an

1280
01:13:53 --> 01:13:57
experiment on when you do or do
not eat, but that's not what

1281
01:13:57 --> 01:14:00
you're dealing with out in --
well, alright, here is a way

1282
01:14:00 --> 01:14:02
to get to this question.
 

1283
01:14:02 --> 01:14:07
How many of you have ever
eaten something when

1284
01:14:07 --> 01:14:10
you weren't hungry.
 

1285
01:14:10 --> 01:14:12
Well what's the matter
with you, right?

1286
01:14:12 --> 01:14:14
You know, I just told you,
you've got this elaborate

1287
01:14:14 --> 01:14:16
stuff I've already erased
the lateral hypothalamus.

1288
01:14:16 --> 01:14:20
You've got a brain full of
circuitry designed to make you

1289
01:14:20 --> 01:14:24
eat when you're hungry, and not
to eat when you're not hungry.

1290
01:14:24 --> 01:14:28
And you don't look like
that fury football with

1291
01:14:28 --> 01:14:30
a lesion in your brain.
 

1292
01:14:30 --> 01:14:33
So what's your problem
that you're eating when

1293
01:14:33 --> 01:14:36
you're not hungry?
 

1294
01:14:36 --> 01:14:39
Well all right, let think
about this is sort of

1295
01:14:39 --> 01:14:40
metaphorical terms.
 

1296
01:14:40 --> 01:14:44
Let's imagine a situation where
there are lots of different

1297
01:14:44 --> 01:14:45
possibilities pulling on you.
 

1298
01:14:45 --> 01:14:49
Suppose you're at some sort of
a social gathering of some

1299
01:14:49 --> 01:14:51
sort, there are lots of
possible things, lots of

1300
01:14:51 --> 01:14:55
motivational systems at
work at any one time.

1301
01:14:55 --> 01:14:59
I mean one of the things you
could probably do is eat.

1302
01:14:59 --> 01:15:09
Maybe there's the possibility
for fighting, mating,

1303
01:15:09 --> 01:15:14
sleep, study.
 

1304
01:15:14 --> 01:15:22
You know, you could do all
sorts of, you know, run.

1305
01:15:22 --> 01:15:25
You could do all
sorts of stuff.

1306
01:15:25 --> 01:15:28
And all of these things, each
of which may have it's own

1307
01:15:28 --> 01:15:34
beautiful hard- wired core and
it's an elaboration of a

1308
01:15:34 --> 01:15:37
lifetime of learning, all of
these things are pulling

1309
01:15:37 --> 01:15:40
on you at once.
 

1310
01:15:40 --> 01:15:42
And, well, you know, all right,
so maybe the sleep motivation

1311
01:15:42 --> 01:15:46
and the study motivation are
pretty weak at any given

1312
01:15:46 --> 01:15:48
moment, but you know, let's
suppose that there's pretty

1313
01:15:48 --> 01:15:54
strong drives in
this direction.

1314
01:15:54 --> 01:15:58
OK, so if you're sitting in
this exciting vector field,

1315
01:15:58 --> 01:15:59
where the resultant?
 

1316
01:15:59 --> 01:16:00
Right?
 

1317
01:16:00 --> 01:16:01
Right.
 

1318
01:16:01 --> 01:16:06
AUDIENCE: [Laughter]
 

1319
01:16:06 --> 01:16:10
PROFESSOR: Now, I'm not
proposing this as a serious

1320
01:16:10 --> 01:16:17
model of why you might eat
when, well I am proposing it as

1321
01:16:17 --> 01:16:21
-- I'm not proposing it as a
serious mathematical model of

1322
01:16:21 --> 01:16:24
why you might eat, but I'm
supposing it has a serious

1323
01:16:24 --> 01:16:29
metaphor, that you might
engage, and it's going to be

1324
01:16:29 --> 01:16:34
much more complicated than
this, right, I mean part of the

1325
01:16:34 --> 01:16:37
reason, it's not just that
there's, you know, want to eat?

1326
01:16:37 --> 01:16:38
Want to fight?
 

1327
01:16:38 --> 01:16:41
Oh think I'll go eat instead.
 

1328
01:16:41 --> 01:16:44
But, want to mate,
you know, here?

1329
01:16:44 --> 01:16:46
Now?
 

1330
01:16:46 --> 01:16:50
Can't do that, but they're, you
know, there those brain stem

1331
01:16:50 --> 01:16:53
chunks of general arousal, oh
yeah, well, I've sort of got a

1332
01:16:53 --> 01:16:56
lot of activity here that
I gotta do something.

1333
01:16:56 --> 01:16:58
So you end up with sort of
displacement activity.

1334
01:16:58 --> 01:17:07
The problem is that the world
is a complicated place, and if

1335
01:17:07 --> 01:17:10
you were ever going to reduce
this to map, it's going to

1336
01:17:10 --> 01:17:12
have a lot of variables.
 

1337
01:17:12 --> 01:17:16
It's going to end up with a lot
of variables in the equation.

1338
01:17:16 --> 01:17:18
Most of us manage to do OK.
 

1339
01:17:18 --> 01:17:23
We eat when we don't want,
but that's all right.

1340
01:17:23 --> 01:17:26
Later on in the course, you end
up talking about, you know,

1341
01:17:26 --> 01:17:30
perhaps the people where you
find that they're fighting too

1342
01:17:30 --> 01:17:32
much or something like that.
 

1343
01:17:32 --> 01:17:35
 
 

1344
01:17:35 --> 01:17:38
No lecture Thursday, just to
reiterate, I will sign all

1345
01:17:38 --> 01:17:40
those lovely add drop cards.
 

1346
01:17:40 --> 01:17:41
I'll see you next week.
 

1347
01:17:41 --> 01:17:43
