7
00:00:14 --> 00:00:15
PROFESSOR:
 

8
00:00:15 --> 00:00:19
Good afternoon.
 

9
00:00:19 --> 00:00:26
 
 

10
00:00:26 --> 00:00:30
Now that all you turkeys are
back from Thanksgiving.

11
00:00:30 --> 00:00:31
I shouldn't have said that.
 

12
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
How was Thanksgiving?
 

13
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
Good.
 

14
00:00:37 --> 00:00:41
As I'm wrapping up the sleep
and dreams thing, I should look

15
00:00:41 --> 00:00:45
around and see whether people
look like they're awake.

16
00:00:45 --> 00:00:48
How many people discharged a
substantial amount of their

17
00:00:48 --> 00:00:53
sleep debt over the
last few days?

18
00:00:53 --> 00:00:53
Good.
 

19
00:00:53 --> 00:00:58
The rest of you are
still rolling around.

20
00:00:58 --> 00:01:03
I am going -- I'm going,
but I'm coming back.

21
00:01:03 --> 00:01:07
 
 

22
00:01:07 --> 00:01:13
I think I'm going to depart a
little from the organization of

23
00:01:13 --> 00:01:18
the lecture that's on the
lecture notes, and I will trust

24
00:01:18 --> 00:01:23
on your talents to figure out
where -- I might even point out

25
00:01:23 --> 00:01:27
where I've gone to -- but I'm
going to re-organize things a

26
00:01:27 --> 00:01:32
bit, because it occurred to me
that I can organize at least

27
00:01:32 --> 00:01:42
the first part of the lecture
in the form of a sort of a

28
00:01:42 --> 00:01:46
summary statement about Freud,
who I'm going to abandon

29
00:01:46 --> 00:01:48
fairly shortly here.
 

30
00:01:48 --> 00:01:53
And I can work two examples --
one of them about dreams and

31
00:01:53 --> 00:02:02
one of them about abnormal
psych, where Freud or Freud's

32
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
followers are wrong
in both cases.

33
00:02:04 --> 00:02:09
But in one case, we can do this
business that I've been doing

34
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
for the last few lectures of
saying look, we can salvage

35
00:02:11 --> 00:02:16
something important out of
Freud's ideas, and in the other

36
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
case, which will turn out to be
the abnormal psych case, we'll

37
00:02:19 --> 00:02:23
say that, in this case, Freud's
followers are simply wrong.

38
00:02:23 --> 00:02:31
And have been superceded
by later work.

39
00:02:31 --> 00:02:36
So let me start by picking
up in sleep and dreamland

40
00:02:36 --> 00:02:42
talking about dreams.
 

41
00:02:42 --> 00:02:45
Well, I won't ask if anybody
had any good dreams over the

42
00:02:45 --> 00:02:49
course of their catching up
on sleep over Thanksgiving.

43
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
 
 

44
00:02:52 --> 00:02:53
I know what I'll ask.
 

45
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
I will ask how many people
did sleep and dream

46
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
stuff in recitation?
 

47
00:02:58 --> 00:02:59
Not many.
 

48
00:02:59 --> 00:02:59
OK.
 

49
00:02:59 --> 00:03:02
How many people can remember?
 

50
00:03:02 --> 00:03:03
Not many.
 

51
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
Oh, good, good,
that's encouraging.

52
00:03:05 --> 00:03:08
 
 

53
00:03:08 --> 00:03:14
All right, that allows me to
ask one of the things that

54
00:03:14 --> 00:03:17
tends to surprise people
sometimes is that there's a

55
00:03:17 --> 00:03:21
fair degree of commonality
in at least some of the

56
00:03:21 --> 00:03:23
dreams that people have.
 

57
00:03:23 --> 00:03:28
They seem like such
idiosyncratic personalized

58
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
stories, that it's surprising
to discover that some of the

59
00:03:31 --> 00:03:37
plot lines go across
individuals.

60
00:03:37 --> 00:03:38
It's a weird state, right.
 

61
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
I mean it's clear there
are weird aspects of

62
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
the sleeping state.
 

63
00:03:43 --> 00:03:50
The normal laws of physics seem
to be suspendable -- you can

64
00:03:50 --> 00:03:54
fly sometimes, do
things like that.

65
00:03:54 --> 00:04:00
You can fall for hours and
hours and never hit the ground.

66
00:04:00 --> 00:04:04
The normal laws of reality
testing or the awake state of

67
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
reality testing seems to be up,
because you can fly and it

68
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
doesn't strike you as weird.
 

69
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
When you wake up you say that
was weird, but if you think

70
00:04:11 --> 00:04:15
about it, while you were flying
around or doing whatever other

71
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
video game kind of thing you
were doing in your dreams,

72
00:04:17 --> 00:04:20
yeah, that was just
the way things were.

73
00:04:20 --> 00:04:24
If you have the same problem
with reality testing, when

74
00:04:24 --> 00:04:32
you're awake you end up in the
part of the course on abnormal

75
00:04:32 --> 00:04:33
psych that we'll get
to in a minute.

76
00:04:33 --> 00:04:38
It's diagnostic of having a
variety of forms of mental

77
00:04:38 --> 00:04:43
illness if you cannot tell
the difference between dream

78
00:04:43 --> 00:04:46
state and awake state,
that's not healthy.

79
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
When you're dreaming you
can't tell, but you're

80
00:04:48 --> 00:04:50
not clinically insane.
 

81
00:04:50 --> 00:04:55
 
 

82
00:04:55 --> 00:04:59
There was one other sense in
which it was different from the

83
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
awake state that I wanted to
make sure that I mentioned, but

84
00:05:02 --> 00:05:04
now I don't remember
what it is.

85
00:05:04 --> 00:05:10
Oh, yes, just to point out that
the transfer from experience to

86
00:05:10 --> 00:05:14
episodic memory does not
work well for dreaming.

87
00:05:14 --> 00:05:17
This is why you forget your
dreams so readily is that you

88
00:05:17 --> 00:05:20
know when you wake up that
dream is just sort of there

89
00:05:20 --> 00:05:22
sitting around in some sort of
short-term buffer, and if you

90
00:05:22 --> 00:05:25
don't do something like write
it down or repeat it yourself

91
00:05:25 --> 00:05:31
you discover that those normal
mechanisms that take your

92
00:05:31 --> 00:05:34
experiences and transfer them
into some sort of

93
00:05:34 --> 00:05:39
long-term memory, they're
just not working.

94
00:05:39 --> 00:05:44
So, that said, let's see if
we can conjure up--yup?

95
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
AUDIENCE: Especially when
people say they know

96
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
they're dreaming.
 

97
00:05:49 --> 00:05:55
PROFESSOR: All the stuff about
different states of sleep and

98
00:05:55 --> 00:06:00
awakeness should be seen as
not absolutely categorical.

99
00:06:00 --> 00:06:03
So there are these borderline
states -- the sort of jargony

100
00:06:03 --> 00:06:08
term is liminal states where
you're in between being

101
00:06:08 --> 00:06:12
asleep and awake.
 

102
00:06:12 --> 00:06:14
In the course of a normal
night's sleep, you'd probably

103
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
wake up out of REM sleep and
different bits of you are

104
00:06:17 --> 00:06:21
coming online at different
times, and you may be aware,

105
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
still asleep, but I'm
not quite asleep.

106
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
How many people have had the
experience of saying I'm waking

107
00:06:26 --> 00:06:32
up here and I want to know
how the story comes out?

108
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
Yeah, yeah.
 

109
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
It's always cause you're
waking up at the good parts.

110
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
Or how many of you have the
other experience, which I think

111
00:06:39 --> 00:06:43
maybe what you're getting to
which is I'm asleep here and

112
00:06:43 --> 00:06:46
this dream is not a good dream
and it's time to wake

113
00:06:46 --> 00:06:47
up out of this dream.
 

114
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
I'm going to wake myself up.
 

115
00:06:49 --> 00:06:50
Fewer.
 

116
00:06:50 --> 00:06:54
Now, are there people here
who are experts at what's

117
00:06:54 --> 00:06:56
known as lucid dreaming?
 

118
00:06:56 --> 00:07:00
Lucid dreaming is a sort of a
halfway state where people

119
00:07:00 --> 00:07:09
claim to be able to control the
plot line of their dreams.

120
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
There are books in the
bookstore that will both claim

121
00:07:12 --> 00:07:14
that they can train you to do
this, and maybe you

122
00:07:14 --> 00:07:15
can, I don't know.
 

123
00:07:15 --> 00:07:16
It sounds good.
 

124
00:07:16 --> 00:07:20
I mean all those people who
said, oh man, I woke up and

125
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
I wanted to hear out
the thing came out.

126
00:07:22 --> 00:07:25
If you'd go and train yourself
to be a lucid dreamer maybe

127
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
you can go and keep it going.
 

128
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
 
 

129
00:07:30 --> 00:07:34
I have these extremely
frustrating dreams that I'm

130
00:07:34 --> 00:07:39
sure a good analyst would have
a field day with, but I choose

131
00:07:39 --> 00:07:42
to think that they are
basically nice, simple,

132
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
transparent dreams.
 

133
00:07:45 --> 00:07:49
I like to ski, I dream about
skiing, but in my dreams I

134
00:07:49 --> 00:07:53
spend a great deal of time
getting up the mountain

135
00:07:53 --> 00:07:57
and I never get to ski.
 

136
00:07:57 --> 00:08:01
I get to the top and the snow
melts or something like that.

137
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
No, I don't want to hear your
interpretation of what this is

138
00:08:04 --> 00:08:08
all really about or anything --
I can do that, too, and make

139
00:08:08 --> 00:08:09
up all those good stories.
 

140
00:08:09 --> 00:08:13
But in any case, I sometimes
think I'm going to get one of

141
00:08:13 --> 00:08:17
these lucid dreaming books
because dammit, before I die

142
00:08:17 --> 00:08:20
I'm going to get to ski
down that mountain.

143
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
The conditions are always a
great, look a lot better than

144
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
they do in the northeast when
you actually go skiing.

145
00:08:25 --> 00:08:29
 
 

146
00:08:29 --> 00:08:35
So, let us consider a
couple of plot lines.

147
00:08:35 --> 00:08:37
Some of the things, there's
a sort of element that show

148
00:08:37 --> 00:08:38
up in people's dreams.
 

149
00:08:38 --> 00:08:42
How many people have
had falling dreams?

150
00:08:42 --> 00:08:45
How how many people have
ever hit the ground?

151
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
Usually you don't hit the
ground, right -- you wake up

152
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
just before you hit the ground.
 

153
00:08:50 --> 00:08:55
Oh, there's a whole raft of
sort of pseudo-scientific

154
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
nonsense about--.
 

155
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
How many people have ever
been killed in their dreams?

156
00:09:00 --> 00:09:01
A fair number.
 

157
00:09:01 --> 00:09:04
Well, that's presumably a
counter examples to the theory

158
00:09:04 --> 00:09:08
that if you die you in your
dreams you die for real.

159
00:09:08 --> 00:09:09
It's one of those
great assertions.

160
00:09:09 --> 00:09:12
How would you know
that was true?

161
00:09:12 --> 00:09:13
Right.
 

162
00:09:13 --> 00:09:15
What were your dreaming about?
 

163
00:09:15 --> 00:09:16
I don't know, I'm dead.
 

164
00:09:16 --> 00:09:18
 
 

165
00:09:18 --> 00:09:24
But typically, typically people
report that you wake up just

166
00:09:24 --> 00:09:29
before you get killed by the
whatever it is that's

167
00:09:29 --> 00:09:30
going to kill you.
 

168
00:09:30 --> 00:09:33
But the plot lines get
more elaborate than that.

169
00:09:33 --> 00:09:38
How many people have had dreams
-- this is typically a dream of

170
00:09:38 --> 00:09:43
grade school, the grade school
era where you show up in school

171
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47
inappropriately dressed
in some fashion.

172
00:09:47 --> 00:09:53
All right, anybody care to
describe one of those?

173
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
Sorry, I heard a--.
 

174
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
Somebody wave a hand if you
want to actually tell us the

175
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
-- you don't have to
tell us your dream.

176
00:10:00 --> 00:10:02
It's fine.
 

177
00:10:02 --> 00:10:06
Nobody wants to-- How
inappropriate was it?

178
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
I mean it doesn't get much more
inappropriate than I was buck

179
00:10:09 --> 00:10:12
naked, I suppose, which is the
stand-- My version of it

180
00:10:12 --> 00:10:15
happened to be that -- I still
vividly remember what must have

181
00:10:15 --> 00:10:18
been a kindergarten dream
because I ended up in my

182
00:10:18 --> 00:10:22
kindergarten classroom of
driving down the street from my

183
00:10:22 --> 00:10:28
house to my school in my crib,
which presumably, by the time I

184
00:10:28 --> 00:10:32
was in kindergarten I was long
out, and I ended up in school

185
00:10:32 --> 00:10:36
in my crib in my pj's.
 

186
00:10:36 --> 00:10:38
All right, so you don't
have to tell us what

187
00:10:38 --> 00:10:41
you weren't wearing.
 

188
00:10:41 --> 00:10:47
There is a characteristic of
this dream which is that once

189
00:10:47 --> 00:10:53
you get there, once you end
up in class, what happens?

190
00:10:53 --> 00:10:57
Anybody got any intuition about
the common plot line here?

191
00:10:57 --> 00:11:03
 
 

192
00:11:03 --> 00:11:04
AUDIENCE: People
point and laugh.

193
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
PROFESSOR: Oh, people
point and laugh.

194
00:11:07 --> 00:11:07
Do you believe it?
 

195
00:11:07 --> 00:11:12
 
 

196
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
Where's the inappropriately
dressed crowd?

197
00:11:14 --> 00:11:15
Raise your hand if you were
in the inappropriately

198
00:11:15 --> 00:11:16
dressed class.
 

199
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
It's dropped, the
numbers are dropping.

200
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
OK, not inappropriately
dressed right now, this

201
00:11:21 --> 00:11:22
is in your dreams.
 

202
00:11:22 --> 00:11:23
Inappropriately dressed.
 

203
00:11:23 --> 00:11:26
How many people agreed that
what happened was they

204
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
pointed and laughed?
 

205
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
No, it's only in Russia.
 

206
00:11:31 --> 00:11:37
The characteristic form of this
dream is that nobody notices.

207
00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
I mean that's not to say that
you're weird for having the

208
00:11:40 --> 00:11:41
variant -- either that
or you're making it

209
00:11:41 --> 00:11:42
up, I don't know.
 

210
00:11:42 --> 00:11:47
But that you would think, I
would think if I showed up,

211
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
if I drove my crib in here,
everybody's going to point

212
00:11:50 --> 00:11:52
and they're going to laugh.
 

213
00:11:52 --> 00:11:53
But they don't.
 

214
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57
This is assumed to be some sort
of a school anxiety dream.

215
00:11:57 --> 00:12:00
School anxiety dreams of
some sort are quite common.

216
00:12:00 --> 00:12:02
They also morph as
you get older.

217
00:12:02 --> 00:12:10
So, how many people have had
a dream of the form where

218
00:12:10 --> 00:12:13
-- well, all right,
let's rephrase this.

219
00:12:13 --> 00:12:15
We'll get the form out of you.
 

220
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17
Has anybody had what they
would consider to be

221
00:12:17 --> 00:12:22
an exam anxiety dream?
 

222
00:12:22 --> 00:12:23
Anybody willing to
describe that?

223
00:12:23 --> 00:12:26
I don't think they mostly
involve being grossly

224
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
inappropriately dressed.
 

225
00:12:28 --> 00:12:29
Yeah, OK.
 

226
00:12:29 --> 00:12:33
AUDIENCE: Before the psych
mid-term I started [INAUDIBLE]

227
00:12:33 --> 00:12:37
psychological theories that
don't actually exist.

228
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
PROFESSOR: Psychological
-- that's a novel

229
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
form of the dream.
 

230
00:12:42 --> 00:12:43
Any good ones?
 

231
00:12:43 --> 00:12:45
Well, I won't ask you that.
 

232
00:12:45 --> 00:12:47
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
 

233
00:12:47 --> 00:12:51
AUDIENCE: OK, so one version
is the I overslept and

234
00:12:51 --> 00:12:53
you missed the exam.
 

235
00:12:53 --> 00:12:55
Variance thereon?
 

236
00:12:55 --> 00:12:55
Yeah.
 

237
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
AUDIENCE: I slept until about
an hour before the exam.

238
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
Woke up and didn't
study [INAUDIBLE].

239
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
PROFESSOR: OK, I haven't
studied enough for the exam,

240
00:13:03 --> 00:13:06
and perhaps because --
something is going

241
00:13:06 --> 00:13:07
to make it uh-oh.
 

242
00:13:07 --> 00:13:08
Yeah.
 

243
00:13:08 --> 00:13:10
They all pointed at you and
laughed at you, right.

244
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
AUDIENCE: The exam was
in some other language.

245
00:13:13 --> 00:13:16
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
well that happens.

246
00:13:16 --> 00:13:18
Yeah, the exam was in
another language.

247
00:13:18 --> 00:13:23
How many people have had the
version where you realize in

248
00:13:23 --> 00:13:27
your dream that you have an
exam in this course and you've

249
00:13:27 --> 00:13:30
never been to the course?
 

250
00:13:30 --> 00:13:35
Medieval French -- I've got the
Medieval French exam, I've

251
00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
never taken Medieval French.
 

252
00:13:37 --> 00:13:44
Or there are also versions of
this where you get to the exam

253
00:13:44 --> 00:13:46
and you realize that there's
something about the exam -- the

254
00:13:46 --> 00:13:49
different language thing is a
good example of this where you

255
00:13:49 --> 00:13:50
look at the exam and you
realize there's no way

256
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
I'm passing this exam.
 

257
00:13:52 --> 00:13:55
Not because you didn't make up
the right psych theory, but

258
00:13:55 --> 00:14:04
because I can't see the page in
some weird way, or sometimes --

259
00:14:04 --> 00:14:06
oh, somebody was telling me
this morning of a great version

260
00:14:06 --> 00:14:10
where I realize I'm going to be
late to the exam and it's down

261
00:14:10 --> 00:14:13
the other end of the infinite
corridor, and the infinite

262
00:14:13 --> 00:14:17
corridor really is infinite.
 

263
00:14:17 --> 00:14:19
You're just going
down it forever.

264
00:14:19 --> 00:14:25
Anyway, if you haven't had that
dream don't worry, you will.

265
00:14:25 --> 00:14:28
When I was an undergrad
at Princeton, somebody

266
00:14:28 --> 00:14:29
did a study of this.
 

267
00:14:29 --> 00:14:36
25% of the freshman class, 50%
of the sophomore class, 75% of

268
00:14:36 --> 00:14:39
the junior class, and you
can see where this goes.

269
00:14:39 --> 00:14:44
It's an extremely common
college era type dream.

270
00:14:44 --> 00:14:45
And it doesn't get
better after that.

271
00:14:45 --> 00:14:49
All that happens is that,
if you stay in academia,

272
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
is that the form moves.
 

273
00:14:51 --> 00:14:57
Any number of my colleagues
have reported dreams where the

274
00:14:57 --> 00:15:03
-- this is the grad school
version coming up here -- the

275
00:15:03 --> 00:15:07
dream where your thesis
committee comes to you and says

276
00:15:07 --> 00:15:11
it was a big mistake, we're
taking the PhD back, or that

277
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
you have to take your oral
exams over again -- the thing

278
00:15:14 --> 00:15:18
you crammed for months and then
forgot all of it the next week,

279
00:15:18 --> 00:15:19
or something like that.
 

280
00:15:19 --> 00:15:23
And then if you end up in my
position actually teaching, it

281
00:15:23 --> 00:15:30
just flips around the exam
anxiety dream where you have

282
00:15:30 --> 00:15:33
dreams where you get up in
front of the class and you

283
00:15:33 --> 00:15:36
realize Medieval French, I
don't know anything about

284
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
Medieval French, what do you
mean I'm supposed to talk

285
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
about Medieval French
for the next hour?

286
00:15:41 --> 00:15:45
Now you may think that having
anxiety dreams about not

287
00:15:45 --> 00:15:48
knowing what you're talking
about is not that far from

288
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
reality in the case of some
of us who -- I won't say

289
00:15:52 --> 00:15:55
more about that anymore.
 

290
00:15:55 --> 00:15:59
But there are these sort
of common themes that

291
00:15:59 --> 00:16:00
run through dreams.
 

292
00:16:00 --> 00:16:03
People have known this forever,
and people have attempted to

293
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
interpret dreams forever.
 

294
00:16:05 --> 00:16:09
So there's dream
interpretation in the Bible.

295
00:16:09 --> 00:16:12
I'm sure in whatever culture
you or your ancestors came

296
00:16:12 --> 00:16:17
from there's a canon of
dream interpretation.

297
00:16:17 --> 00:16:23
Have I mentioned Lucretius's
great book De Rerum Natura,

298
00:16:23 --> 00:16:26
On the Nature of Things?
 

299
00:16:26 --> 00:16:26
Yeah.
 

300
00:16:26 --> 00:16:27
Maybe.
 

301
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
Some people think so, some
people don't think so.

302
00:16:29 --> 00:16:32
Oh well, what you gonna do?
 

303
00:16:32 --> 00:16:36
Roman author, and it really is
about the nature of things.

304
00:16:36 --> 00:16:40
It's everything, you know, it's
1801 and 801 and 900, and it's

305
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
all rolled in one
great big book.

306
00:16:43 --> 00:16:46
But he's got a nice dream
theory in there in which he

307
00:16:46 --> 00:16:51
says that lawyers dream of
court cases and sailors are

308
00:16:51 --> 00:16:54
wrestling with the winds and
things of that sort suggesting,

309
00:16:54 --> 00:16:57
as Freud would later suggest
that every dream reflects

310
00:16:57 --> 00:17:01
something about the
preceding day.

311
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
Oh, let me say
something about that.

312
00:17:04 --> 00:17:06
I think I'm jumping ahead
in my handout again.

313
00:17:06 --> 00:17:08
Oh well.
 

314
00:17:08 --> 00:17:12
This was always assumed
anecdotally to be true.

315
00:17:12 --> 00:17:15
 
 

316
00:17:15 --> 00:17:16
You may have had
this experience.

317
00:17:16 --> 00:17:21
You do something all day and
you dream about it all night.

318
00:17:21 --> 00:17:24
 
 

319
00:17:24 --> 00:17:26
There wasn't much data on this.
 

320
00:17:26 --> 00:17:31
Bob Stickgold at Harvard Med
has now gone off and collected

321
00:17:31 --> 00:17:32
some beautiful data on this.
 

322
00:17:32 --> 00:17:38
What he did was he got people
to play Tetris, a lot Tetris.

323
00:17:38 --> 00:17:43
Then he sent them to bed with
little wires on their head and

324
00:17:43 --> 00:17:45
when they went into REM sleep
he kicked them -- pow -- what

325
00:17:45 --> 00:17:46
are you dreaming about?
 

326
00:17:46 --> 00:17:49
Oh man, bricks,
they're falling, man.

327
00:17:49 --> 00:17:52
 
 

328
00:17:52 --> 00:17:55
Nice clear evidence --
of course, there's a

329
00:17:55 --> 00:17:57
non-Tetris control group.
 

330
00:17:57 --> 00:17:59
You kick them, oh I'm flying
down the infinite corridor.

331
00:17:59 --> 00:18:00
You know, something else.
 

332
00:18:00 --> 00:18:03
The Tetris group
dreamed about Tetris.

333
00:18:03 --> 00:18:08
The coolest thing about
Stickgold's experiment is that

334
00:18:08 --> 00:18:12
he tested a population of
amnesics -- patients with the

335
00:18:12 --> 00:18:15
same basic problem as HM.
 

336
00:18:15 --> 00:18:18
Remember HM, no new
long-term memories.

337
00:18:18 --> 00:18:19
Learn how to play Tetris?
 

338
00:18:19 --> 00:18:20
Grr.
 

339
00:18:20 --> 00:18:20
What are you doing?
 

340
00:18:20 --> 00:18:21
I'm playing Tetris.
 

341
00:18:21 --> 00:18:22
Five minutes later.
 

342
00:18:22 --> 00:18:23
What were you doing?
 

343
00:18:23 --> 00:18:24
I don't know.
 

344
00:18:24 --> 00:18:25
Right, doesn't
remember any of this.

345
00:18:25 --> 00:18:29
So he takes these amnesics,
they play Tetris for a while,

346
00:18:29 --> 00:18:30
they're having a great time.
 

347
00:18:30 --> 00:18:32
You send them to bed,
you kick them in the

348
00:18:32 --> 00:18:33
middle of the night.
 

349
00:18:33 --> 00:18:34
What are you dreaming about?
 

350
00:18:34 --> 00:18:36
Oh, bricks, bricks, the
bricks are falling.

351
00:18:36 --> 00:18:39
They were dreaming about Tetris
even though they didn't

352
00:18:39 --> 00:18:42
remember ever having
played Tetris.

353
00:18:42 --> 00:18:43
That was pretty cool.
 

354
00:18:43 --> 00:18:45
Anyway, there's now
experimental evidence for this

355
00:18:45 --> 00:18:50
notion that your dreams
incorporate material from

356
00:18:50 --> 00:18:51
the preceding days.
 

357
00:18:51 --> 00:18:54
Freud asserted that all dreams
incorporated something

358
00:18:54 --> 00:18:55
from the preceding day.
 

359
00:18:55 --> 00:18:56
Is that absolutely true?
 

360
00:18:56 --> 00:19:02
Well, that's one of those
assertions like all snowflakes

361
00:19:02 --> 00:19:05
are different, that's
kind of hard to prove.

362
00:19:05 --> 00:19:08
But certainly material
from the preceding day

363
00:19:08 --> 00:19:09
gets incorporated.
 

364
00:19:09 --> 00:19:10
Is that a hand?
 

365
00:19:10 --> 00:19:10
That is a hand.
 

366
00:19:10 --> 00:19:14
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering,
so there an experiment done

367
00:19:14 --> 00:19:17
where they had these
animals running through

368
00:19:17 --> 00:19:18
the [INAUDIBLE].
 

369
00:19:18 --> 00:19:21
PROFESSOR: Oh, yes, thank
you for reminding me.

370
00:19:21 --> 00:19:24
AUDIENCE: I was just
wondering that [INAUDIBLE],

371
00:19:24 --> 00:19:26
when they were in,
 

372
00:19:26 --> 00:19:32
when the [UNINTELLIGIBLE],
their brains, I mean is a fMRI

373
00:19:32 --> 00:19:35
where it's showing activity--
 

374
00:19:35 --> 00:19:37
PROFESSOR: Answer's pretty
good, she's going to give

375
00:19:37 --> 00:19:39
the rest of the story here.
 

376
00:19:39 --> 00:19:42
None of you guys are
from that lab, right?

377
00:19:42 --> 00:19:44
It's done here.
 

378
00:19:44 --> 00:19:51
So, if you look in the brain
of, in the hippocampus of a

379
00:19:51 --> 00:19:55
rat, what you discover is the
hippocampus not only is there

380
00:19:55 --> 00:19:58
encoding the rat's episodic
memories in some sense maybe

381
00:19:58 --> 00:20:01
but, it's also serving
as a spatial map.

382
00:20:01 --> 00:20:08
So when a rat learns a maze, it
develops a map of that maze, in

383
00:20:08 --> 00:20:11
effect, in its hippocampus, and
it develops cells that are

384
00:20:11 --> 00:20:14
so-called place -- it's got
place cells and the place cells

385
00:20:14 --> 00:20:17
develop responses that are
specific to a specific place.

386
00:20:17 --> 00:20:21
So, the rat's running around in
a maze, and this cell goes off

387
00:20:21 --> 00:20:24
right here -- nananana -- go
over here, different cell goes

388
00:20:24 --> 00:20:27
off -- nananana -- go over
here, different cell goes off.

389
00:20:27 --> 00:20:30
And as the rat learns the maze,
you, the experimenter, can

390
00:20:30 --> 00:20:34
watch the rat learning this
because you can watch cells in

391
00:20:34 --> 00:20:38
the hippocampus lighting
up in order, in effect.

392
00:20:38 --> 00:20:40
So now the rat does this
all day -- nananana.

393
00:20:40 --> 00:20:43
OK, the rat goes to sleep,
the rat goes into REM sleep.

394
00:20:43 --> 00:20:47
All mammalian species, except
for the spiny anteater -- don't

395
00:20:47 --> 00:20:50
ask me why I know that -- all
mammalian species

396
00:20:50 --> 00:20:51
have REM sleep.
 

397
00:20:51 --> 00:20:53
So you kick the rat, you
ask the rat what he

398
00:20:53 --> 00:20:55
was dreaming about.
 

399
00:20:55 --> 00:20:58
Rat doesn't say nothing.
 

400
00:20:58 --> 00:21:01
But, if you're recording from
his hippocampus while he's

401
00:21:01 --> 00:21:04
asleep, what you see is the
same cells lighting

402
00:21:04 --> 00:21:06
up in order again.
 

403
00:21:06 --> 00:21:09
Who knows what the rat's
actually experiencing, but

404
00:21:09 --> 00:21:13
what the rat's hippocampus is
doing is running the maze.

405
00:21:13 --> 00:21:18
This is, first of all, part of
the argument for sleep having

406
00:21:18 --> 00:21:20
something to do with
consolidation of memory and

407
00:21:20 --> 00:21:26
learning, and it's also an
argument for the possibility at

408
00:21:26 --> 00:21:33
least that the rats are
dreaming away there, too.

409
00:21:33 --> 00:21:41
Well now, arguably Freud's
greatest work is Interpretation

410
00:21:41 --> 00:21:43
of Dreams -- that's the name of
the book -- big, fat book.

411
00:21:43 --> 00:21:48
Still kind of fun to read but
it's kind of long -- from 1900.

412
00:21:48 --> 00:21:51
Remember that Freud was writing
before we knew any of this

413
00:21:51 --> 00:21:55
stuff about REM sleep or
anything of that sort.

414
00:21:55 --> 00:22:03
And what Freud thought was
happening was that pressure

415
00:22:03 --> 00:22:06
was building up in
your unconscious.

416
00:22:06 --> 00:22:09
So let's switch from sort of
it dungeon model to sort

417
00:22:09 --> 00:22:10
of a plumbing model.
 

418
00:22:10 --> 00:22:13
Well, we've got the boiler
down in the dungeon and it's

419
00:22:13 --> 00:22:16
building up pressure -- this
repressed material that

420
00:22:16 --> 00:22:17
we've been talking about.
 

421
00:22:17 --> 00:22:20
It's building up pressure and
it's going to blow the roof off

422
00:22:20 --> 00:22:23
the whole building unless we
vent some of the pressure.

423
00:22:23 --> 00:22:26
And so you've got to be able
to -- whoosh -- get some

424
00:22:26 --> 00:22:27
of that out of there.
 

425
00:22:27 --> 00:22:34
One of the ways to do it is
dreams -- to release this

426
00:22:34 --> 00:22:36
while you're asleep.
 

427
00:22:36 --> 00:22:44
Now what Freud said was that
dreams start when some hunk of

428
00:22:44 --> 00:22:50
the preceding day, that he
called the day residue, some

429
00:22:50 --> 00:22:55
idea, some activity, some
something made an association

430
00:22:55 --> 00:23:00
with something down in
your repressed -- in

431
00:23:00 --> 00:23:02
your unconscious.
 

432
00:23:02 --> 00:23:04
And that allowed this
unconscious prisoner to try

433
00:23:04 --> 00:23:06
and make a break for freedom.
 

434
00:23:06 --> 00:23:09
 
 

435
00:23:09 --> 00:23:15
The form of that break would be
an effort to fulfill this

436
00:23:15 --> 00:23:18
repressed wish, if you like --
that's why it was called wish

437
00:23:18 --> 00:23:31
fulfillment -- meant that you
were going to try to fulfill

438
00:23:31 --> 00:23:36
one of these repressed wishes
while you were asleep.

439
00:23:36 --> 00:23:42
There's a problem with that,
said Freud, which is if you

440
00:23:42 --> 00:23:46
take the materials out -- the
repressed material to be this

441
00:23:46 --> 00:23:50
stuff that's repressed because
it's unacceptable to you, to

442
00:23:50 --> 00:23:53
the conscious you, to the ego,
what's going to happen if you

443
00:23:53 --> 00:23:54
start dreaming about it?
 

444
00:23:54 --> 00:23:56
Well, we've already gotten
part of the answer here.

445
00:23:56 --> 00:24:00
Many people here have had
dreams so awful that

446
00:24:00 --> 00:24:04
they've deliberately woken
themselves up out of them.

447
00:24:04 --> 00:24:09
Now most of those dreams, I
would imagine, were dreams

448
00:24:09 --> 00:24:11
where the monster's about to
put the bite on you or

449
00:24:11 --> 00:24:13
something like that.
 

450
00:24:13 --> 00:24:16
What Freud said is that look,
if you were going to start

451
00:24:16 --> 00:24:19
dreaming about, oh, let's
dismember my little brother

452
00:24:19 --> 00:24:22
-- oh, look at his little guts.
 

453
00:24:22 --> 00:24:25
Stuff like that, that would
be really gross and really

454
00:24:25 --> 00:24:28
disturbing and you would say
to yourself, I don't want

455
00:24:28 --> 00:24:29
to be having this dream.
 

456
00:24:29 --> 00:24:30
And you would wake up.
 

457
00:24:30 --> 00:24:34
So what you need to do
is to disguise the

458
00:24:34 --> 00:24:36
material in the dream.
 

459
00:24:36 --> 00:24:41
So you've got, said Freud, the
latent content of the dream

460
00:24:41 --> 00:24:44
that you don't know about.
 

461
00:24:44 --> 00:24:51
The latent content is the
repressed material that's

462
00:24:51 --> 00:24:53
trying to be vented out.
 

463
00:24:53 --> 00:25:03
What you see is the manifest
content, which is the

464
00:25:03 --> 00:25:06
storyline of the dream.
 

465
00:25:06 --> 00:25:11
It's hidden material -- it is
hiding the latent content from

466
00:25:11 --> 00:25:13
you so that you can sleep.
 

467
00:25:13 --> 00:25:17
Freud argued that the primary
role of the sort of sleep

468
00:25:17 --> 00:25:21
mechanism was to protect the
sleeper, to keep you asleep and

469
00:25:21 --> 00:25:25
allow you to sleep, and allow
this sort of venting of

470
00:25:25 --> 00:25:32
repressed steam to take place.
 

471
00:25:32 --> 00:25:36
Were you to show up in analysis
the reason your dreams would

472
00:25:36 --> 00:25:39
be, what Freud called the royal
road to the unconscious, was if

473
00:25:39 --> 00:25:42
you could work back from the
manifest content to the latent

474
00:25:42 --> 00:25:46
content, which was a job of
analysis, not a job of picking

475
00:25:46 --> 00:25:49
up some supermarket guide to
your dreams, but a job of

476
00:25:49 --> 00:25:51
working with you
and an analyst.

477
00:25:51 --> 00:25:53
But if you could go back from
the manifest content to the

478
00:25:53 --> 00:25:56
latent content, you'd know
something about what it

479
00:25:56 --> 00:25:58
was that was bugging you.
 

480
00:25:58 --> 00:26:01
Now the fact that, like
repression as a whole, the fact

481
00:26:01 --> 00:26:05
that you have these disguised
dreams all the time doesn't

482
00:26:05 --> 00:26:08
mean that you're somehow
sick and diseased.

483
00:26:08 --> 00:26:10
It means that's part,
again, of what it means

484
00:26:10 --> 00:26:12
to be human for Freud.
 

485
00:26:12 --> 00:26:13
You're going to need
repression, you're going to

486
00:26:13 --> 00:26:17
need to be able to bubble off
some of this repressed energy,

487
00:26:17 --> 00:26:22
and dreams are a nice
safe way to do it.

488
00:26:22 --> 00:26:26
That's an interesting theory,
but it runs into some major

489
00:26:26 --> 00:26:28
problems, which, of course,
Freud didn't know about because

490
00:26:28 --> 00:26:32
he died in 1939 and REM
wasn't discovered for another

491
00:26:32 --> 00:26:33
couple of decades or so.
 

492
00:26:33 --> 00:26:38
When REM is discovered it
becomes a lot harder to believe

493
00:26:38 --> 00:26:44
that you are boiling up this
little poof of repressed energy

494
00:26:44 --> 00:26:49
every ninety minutes
like clockwork.

495
00:26:49 --> 00:26:51
That's a bit surprising.
 

496
00:26:51 --> 00:26:53
Well, that's a bit surprising.
 

497
00:26:53 --> 00:26:58
More surprising is if you look
at babies, a one month old is

498
00:26:58 --> 00:27:01
REMing a great deal more
than you're REMing.

499
00:27:01 --> 00:27:03
How much repressed stuff
does a one month old

500
00:27:03 --> 00:27:05
baby have to deal with?
 

501
00:27:05 --> 00:27:05
Not much.
 

502
00:27:05 --> 00:27:07
How about a lion?
 

503
00:27:07 --> 00:27:09
Lions, they REM all the time.
 

504
00:27:09 --> 00:27:12
Apparently predators show more
REM than prey, as I recall.

505
00:27:12 --> 00:27:16
So yeah, all the mammals are
sitting there doing this REM

506
00:27:16 --> 00:27:21
thing, right, you know lions,
except for like Scar in the

507
00:27:21 --> 00:27:23
Lion King and stuff like that.
 

508
00:27:23 --> 00:27:27
There's not a lot of repressed
work that a lion presumably

509
00:27:27 --> 00:27:28
has to deal with.
 

510
00:27:28 --> 00:27:33
Or a cow -- cows don't REM that
much, but you know, ah, I

511
00:27:33 --> 00:27:35
really wanted to
hurt the grass.

512
00:27:35 --> 00:27:39
I feel bad about the
-- I don't know.

513
00:27:39 --> 00:27:52
So presumably, now what's going
on when you dream and when you

514
00:27:52 --> 00:27:55
go into REM is that there are
centers down in your brain stem

515
00:27:55 --> 00:28:03
that spray of vast amount of
activity up into cortex and

516
00:28:03 --> 00:28:06
light it up as though you were
awake -- that's what you

517
00:28:06 --> 00:28:07
end up seeing in REM.
 

518
00:28:07 --> 00:28:11
 
 

519
00:28:11 --> 00:28:15
One of the senses in which
Freud was right is the sense

520
00:28:15 --> 00:28:21
in which dreaming does
protect the sleeper.

521
00:28:21 --> 00:28:25
If you light up -- you're
trying to go to sleep, right,

522
00:28:25 --> 00:28:28
and I light up cortex by coming
into your room, turning on all

523
00:28:28 --> 00:28:31
the lights and turning the
stereo way up, you have

524
00:28:31 --> 00:28:33
trouble sleeping.
 

525
00:28:33 --> 00:28:35
Well your brain's doing the
same kind of thing when you go

526
00:28:35 --> 00:28:39
into REM sleep, but you've got
to do something with all that

527
00:28:39 --> 00:28:42
cortical activity or you're
just going to wake up.

528
00:28:42 --> 00:28:45
So you turn it into this
storyline for who knows who

529
00:28:45 --> 00:28:50
to watch on the big wide
screen TV in your brain.

530
00:28:50 --> 00:28:57
In that sense you do
end up protecting your

531
00:28:57 --> 00:28:59
sleep by dreaming.
 

532
00:28:59 --> 00:29:04
In fact, many -- Freud wasn't
thinking about alarm clocks,

533
00:29:04 --> 00:29:06
but an example of this would
be how many of you have

534
00:29:06 --> 00:29:11
incorporated your alarm clock
into a dream and managed to

535
00:29:11 --> 00:29:15
successfully stay asleep?
 

536
00:29:15 --> 00:29:18
Well that's sort of a
non-Freudian sense in

537
00:29:18 --> 00:29:23
which the dream engine is
protecting your sleep.

538
00:29:23 --> 00:29:25
I want to stay asleep here,
there's a loud noise, well I

539
00:29:25 --> 00:29:27
don't know where this loud
noise is coming from, my brain

540
00:29:27 --> 00:29:31
stem's making these loud noises
all the time, so let's just

541
00:29:31 --> 00:29:35
pretend it's from the inside
and not the outside and we can

542
00:29:35 --> 00:29:37
dream that we're getting up.
 

543
00:29:37 --> 00:29:38
Right, dream that
we're getting up.

544
00:29:38 --> 00:29:41
We'll dream that we're going to
class and taking the exam and

545
00:29:41 --> 00:29:44
then we wake up and it really
is halfway through -- don't do

546
00:29:44 --> 00:29:46
this at the final, please.
 

547
00:29:46 --> 00:29:48
It's so lame.
 

548
00:29:48 --> 00:29:51
Particularly since the
exam's at -- the 900

549
00:29:51 --> 00:29:52
final's 1:30, right?
 

550
00:29:52 --> 00:29:54
Got plenty of time
to wake up by 1:30.

551
00:29:54 --> 00:30:00
But every year somebody wanders
in at like 2:30, 3:00 o'clock

552
00:30:00 --> 00:30:02
with the big bags under
the eyes, right.

553
00:30:02 --> 00:30:06
So you do sort of believe
them -- I just woke up.

554
00:30:06 --> 00:30:11
Well, good, sit down, see
if you can see the exam.

555
00:30:11 --> 00:30:17
Anyway, so there's that sense
in which Freud had a point that

556
00:30:17 --> 00:30:19
sleep was protecting the
dreamer. but is there

557
00:30:19 --> 00:30:21
any meaning to it?
 

558
00:30:21 --> 00:30:24
Is there any sense in which
there there's meaning

559
00:30:24 --> 00:30:26
in your dreams.
 

560
00:30:26 --> 00:30:29
I mean after all you are
dreaming because your brain

561
00:30:29 --> 00:30:34
stem decided to throw all the
switches in your visual cortex

562
00:30:34 --> 00:30:37
or something and you're
busy trying to stay asleep.

563
00:30:37 --> 00:30:40
I think there is a sense in
which you might be able to

564
00:30:40 --> 00:30:43
argue that you could get
something meaningful at a dream

565
00:30:43 --> 00:30:46
-- you're not just looking
at static on the brain.

566
00:30:46 --> 00:30:49
Actually, I thought of a way to
demo this, but I didn't bring

567
00:30:49 --> 00:30:52
any of the props because I only
saw it when I saw this thing.

568
00:30:52 --> 00:30:56
So, a piece of paper -- I've
probably got a piece of paper.

569
00:30:56 --> 00:30:58
Who's got a coin on them?
 

570
00:30:58 --> 00:31:00
Somebody have a coin?
 

571
00:31:00 --> 00:31:02
Let's see if I can
make this work.

572
00:31:02 --> 00:31:05
 
 

573
00:31:05 --> 00:31:08
That looks pretty so far.
 

574
00:31:08 --> 00:31:09
And I also need a pencil.
 

575
00:31:09 --> 00:31:11
Somebody have a pencil --
it works better with a

576
00:31:11 --> 00:31:12
pencil than with a pen.
 

577
00:31:12 --> 00:31:14
Oh my goodness, it's coming all
the way from the cheap seats.

578
00:31:14 --> 00:31:18
 
 

579
00:31:18 --> 00:31:21
Visual search.
 

580
00:31:21 --> 00:31:23
Oh, you wanted to do
this because -- he's

581
00:31:23 --> 00:31:24
got a fancy coin.
 

582
00:31:24 --> 00:31:26
This is very cool here.
 

583
00:31:26 --> 00:31:29
 
 

584
00:31:29 --> 00:31:31
All right, pencil,
got a pencil?

585
00:31:31 --> 00:31:32
Here we go.
 

586
00:31:32 --> 00:31:35
OK, this is my brain.
 

587
00:31:35 --> 00:31:40
 
 

588
00:31:40 --> 00:31:43
Thank you.
 

589
00:31:43 --> 00:31:47
Didn't you have something
else you needed to do today?

590
00:31:47 --> 00:31:49
Well actually, it's just
my cortex -- it can

591
00:31:49 --> 00:31:49
just be my cortex.
 

592
00:31:49 --> 00:31:55
 
 

593
00:31:55 --> 00:31:56
Well that's my
cortex under there.

594
00:31:56 --> 00:31:58
This is my brain stem.
 

595
00:31:58 --> 00:32:02
So now I will spray activity
across my cortex here, and

596
00:32:02 --> 00:32:03
let's see if this
sort of works.

597
00:32:03 --> 00:32:11
 
 

598
00:32:11 --> 00:32:14
It looks like
squat, doesn't it?

599
00:32:14 --> 00:32:16
Well you know what?
 

600
00:32:16 --> 00:32:18
That's a really
boring dorkey demo.

601
00:32:18 --> 00:32:21
 
 

602
00:32:21 --> 00:32:22
It's a fidelity issue.
 

603
00:32:22 --> 00:32:27
I can see what-- Use
a different pencil?

604
00:32:27 --> 00:32:28
A wooden pencil.
 

605
00:32:28 --> 00:32:29
No, no, no, no.
 

606
00:32:29 --> 00:32:31
It looks just fine from here.
 

607
00:32:31 --> 00:32:34
Here, we'll try the other side
up, see if that works any

608
00:32:34 --> 00:32:37
better but I don't
think it will.

609
00:32:37 --> 00:32:39
Do it at more of an angle?
 

610
00:32:39 --> 00:32:41
Hold the pencil up
more of an angle.

611
00:32:41 --> 00:32:43
All right, we'll try
this one more time.

612
00:32:43 --> 00:32:46
Oh look, maybe we're
getting -- I don't know,

613
00:32:46 --> 00:32:47
what are we getting?
 

614
00:32:47 --> 00:32:51
We're getting nothing.
 

615
00:32:51 --> 00:32:52
We're getting nothing that
you're going to see.

616
00:32:52 --> 00:32:54
Oh yeah, no, you can sort
of see something but

617
00:32:54 --> 00:32:55
it's really boring.
 

618
00:32:55 --> 00:32:56
Well that was lovely.
 

619
00:32:56 --> 00:32:56
Here we go.
 

620
00:32:56 --> 00:33:10
 
 

621
00:33:10 --> 00:33:14
Here's what I was doing that
didn't work but makes a

622
00:33:14 --> 00:33:17
brilliant model anyway.
 

623
00:33:17 --> 00:33:19
You can try this for yourself.
 

624
00:33:19 --> 00:33:23
If you stick a coin under a
piece of paper and rub a pencil

625
00:33:23 --> 00:33:26
over it, you can actually
see the shape of the

626
00:33:26 --> 00:33:28
pattern on the coin.
 

627
00:33:28 --> 00:33:31
Anybody here ever done brass
rubbing or greystone rubbing

628
00:33:31 --> 00:33:33
or any of that sort of--?
 

629
00:33:33 --> 00:33:34
No.
 

630
00:33:34 --> 00:33:34
A few people.
 

631
00:33:34 --> 00:33:35
All right.
 

632
00:33:35 --> 00:33:40
Look, the point is that by
spraying random noise across a

633
00:33:40 --> 00:33:43
structured object, in effect, I
can see something

634
00:33:43 --> 00:33:45
of the structure.
 

635
00:33:45 --> 00:33:49
Boy, this took more minutes
than it should have.

636
00:33:49 --> 00:33:53
By spraying random noise from
your brain stem, across your

637
00:33:53 --> 00:33:57
particular brain, the
particular dreams that you get

638
00:33:57 --> 00:33:59
are going to say something
about that underlying

639
00:33:59 --> 00:34:00
structure.
 

640
00:34:00 --> 00:34:12
So, Attila the Hun, when he was
dreaming was not dreaming about

641
00:34:12 --> 00:34:16
trains going into tunnels or
stuff like that, because

642
00:34:16 --> 00:34:19
Attila the Hun didn't know
anything about trains.

643
00:34:19 --> 00:34:22
You dream about trains, they
may or may not -- trains going

644
00:34:22 --> 00:34:25
into tunnels, you know it's
sort of a classic supermarket

645
00:34:25 --> 00:34:28
dream analysis image
of a sexual dream or

646
00:34:28 --> 00:34:29
something like that.
 

647
00:34:29 --> 00:34:32
It may or may not be a sexual
dream, but the content of that

648
00:34:32 --> 00:34:37
dream, that set of imagery, is
a function of your

649
00:34:37 --> 00:34:38
particular brain.
 

650
00:34:38 --> 00:34:41
If your dream about Tetris
after playing Tetris all day,

651
00:34:41 --> 00:34:43
it's because you were playing
the Tetris, not because

652
00:34:43 --> 00:34:44
somebody else was
playing Tetris.

653
00:34:44 --> 00:34:49
So it could well be if you
thought you had a process for

654
00:34:49 --> 00:34:54
going back from the storyline
that's there to protect you

655
00:34:54 --> 00:34:58
from waking up with all that
noise in your head to the

656
00:34:58 --> 00:35:02
underlying structure of your
mind, if you had a process that

657
00:35:02 --> 00:35:05
you thought worked, then it
follows that you might actually

658
00:35:05 --> 00:35:08
get some sort of interesting
meaning out of your dreams.

659
00:35:08 --> 00:35:10
Now it's quite a leap to
decide that you actually

660
00:35:10 --> 00:35:11
know how to do this.
 

661
00:35:11 --> 00:35:13
Analysts think they do.
 

662
00:35:13 --> 00:35:16
People who write guides
to dream interpretation

663
00:35:16 --> 00:35:19
think they do.
 

664
00:35:19 --> 00:35:23
I think I'll just leave it at
that as an exercise for the

665
00:35:23 --> 00:35:26
reader to go and decide whether
or not they've got deep

666
00:35:26 --> 00:35:30
meaning in their dreams.
 

667
00:35:30 --> 00:35:36
So that's an example where
Freud didn't know the

668
00:35:36 --> 00:35:41
subsequent hundred years of
sleep research, so if you

669
00:35:41 --> 00:35:44
actually read Interpretation of
Dreams, a lot of it would sound

670
00:35:44 --> 00:35:45
kind of odd at this point.
 

671
00:35:45 --> 00:35:51
But the core ideas that sleep
needs to protect you, keep you

672
00:35:51 --> 00:35:58
asleep and that it's sort of a
re-packaging of this activity

673
00:35:58 --> 00:36:04
of your mind, those seem to be
core ideas that can still do a

674
00:36:04 --> 00:36:06
certain amount of work for us.
 

675
00:36:06 --> 00:36:11
Now a place where the effort to
apply Freudian ideas did not

676
00:36:11 --> 00:36:17
pan out is in the treatment
of schizophrenia.

677
00:36:17 --> 00:36:20
So I'm going to jump to talking
about that, and I may or may

678
00:36:20 --> 00:36:22
not manage to jump back to the
other things that I claimed I

679
00:36:22 --> 00:36:24
was going to jump back to.
 

680
00:36:24 --> 00:36:26
But I might.
 

681
00:36:26 --> 00:36:30
 
 

682
00:36:30 --> 00:36:42
So, in the middle part of 20th
century, mental hospitals in

683
00:36:42 --> 00:36:48
the U.S. were filled with
chronic schizophrenics.

684
00:36:48 --> 00:36:53
Schizophrenia is an extremely
disabling disease when

685
00:36:53 --> 00:36:56
it's in its florid state.
 

686
00:36:56 --> 00:37:01
So, schizophrenia, the word
comes from split mind.

687
00:37:01 --> 00:37:06
As it says on the handout, for
five points free on the final

688
00:37:06 --> 00:37:11
exam probably, not the
same thing as a multiple

689
00:37:11 --> 00:37:13
personality disorder.
 

690
00:37:13 --> 00:37:18
The split in the mind is a
split that 19th century

691
00:37:18 --> 00:37:22
psychiatry saw between
emotional life and

692
00:37:22 --> 00:37:23
cognitive life.
 

693
00:37:23 --> 00:37:26
It is, in fact, sort of an
unfortunate term because it

694
00:37:26 --> 00:37:30
does make people think that
it's the same thing as multiple

695
00:37:30 --> 00:37:31
personality disorder.
 

696
00:37:31 --> 00:37:34
It's not.
 

697
00:37:34 --> 00:37:39
Multiple personality patients
can actually function at least

698
00:37:39 --> 00:37:43
somewhat in the world
reasonably well.

699
00:37:43 --> 00:37:48
Floridly schizophrenic patients
do not work well out there in

700
00:37:48 --> 00:37:51
the world, that's why they
end up hospitalized.

701
00:37:51 --> 00:37:58
The sorts of symptoms that you
get are hallucinations, hearing

702
00:37:58 --> 00:38:04
voices, paranoid delusions
often of vast conspiracies

703
00:38:04 --> 00:38:06
to control your mind.
 

704
00:38:06 --> 00:38:08
You can see this as sort of
an adaptive response, right.

705
00:38:08 --> 00:38:13
If your mind, if some chunk of
you, in a sense, knows that

706
00:38:13 --> 00:38:18
your mind is out of control,
it's not an unreasonable

707
00:38:18 --> 00:38:21
irrational thought to believe
that somebody else is

708
00:38:21 --> 00:38:24
doing this to you.
 

709
00:38:24 --> 00:38:28
So it may, in some sense, be
reasonable to think, to imagine

710
00:38:28 --> 00:38:30
how people could come to
believe that their mind

711
00:38:30 --> 00:38:33
is being controlled
by somebody else.

712
00:38:33 --> 00:38:38
The sorts of things that led to
the notion of a dissocation --

713
00:38:38 --> 00:38:41
I shouldn't say dissociation --
of a split between cognition

714
00:38:41 --> 00:38:44
and emotion, another
characteristic of

715
00:38:44 --> 00:38:47
schizophrenia is so-called
inappropriate affect.

716
00:38:47 --> 00:38:51
That's just jargon for
showing the wrong emotions

717
00:38:51 --> 00:38:52
at the wrong time.
 

718
00:38:52 --> 00:38:57
The sort of classic symptom
is laughing at the funeral.

719
00:38:57 --> 00:39:01
You know, if you're just
yucking it up at graveside or

720
00:39:01 --> 00:39:06
something like that, people
will think that that is not

721
00:39:06 --> 00:39:11
normal, and it is, in fact,
one of the characteristics

722
00:39:11 --> 00:39:13
of schizophrenia.
 

723
00:39:13 --> 00:39:16
And that schizophrenia's sort
of a messy diagnosis -- not

724
00:39:16 --> 00:39:21
every schizophrenic has every
one of these symptoms.

725
00:39:21 --> 00:39:28
But you can imagine that by
the time you're gripped by

726
00:39:28 --> 00:39:32
fantastical thoughts and
conspiracy theories and you're

727
00:39:32 --> 00:39:35
hearing voices and seeing
things that aren't there, that

728
00:39:35 --> 00:39:41
this is pretty disabling stuff.
 

729
00:39:41 --> 00:39:48
 
 

730
00:39:48 --> 00:39:50
It's not so disabling that
you can't be out there in

731
00:39:50 --> 00:39:51
the world, by the way.
 

732
00:39:51 --> 00:39:55
When I was a graduate student,
the MIT Department was

733
00:39:55 --> 00:39:56
called psychology.
 

734
00:39:56 --> 00:40:00
One of the reasons, though
perhaps not one of the more

735
00:40:00 --> 00:40:05
serious reasons, for changing
the name was that my doctoral

736
00:40:05 --> 00:40:07
advisor who was chair of the
department got tired of getting

737
00:40:07 --> 00:40:12
phone calls from people who
wanted to know about stuff like

738
00:40:12 --> 00:40:15
abnormal psychology, which
nobody at the MIT Department

739
00:40:15 --> 00:40:16
ever did anything with.
 

740
00:40:16 --> 00:40:19
So he would always get the
phone call or his secretary

741
00:40:19 --> 00:40:22
would get the phone call and
she was instructed to say,

742
00:40:22 --> 00:40:27
don't call us, they do
that stuff at Harvard.

743
00:40:27 --> 00:40:32
I remember one time when I was
a grad student that rather than

744
00:40:32 --> 00:40:35
phoning up, one of these people
came to the lab and he wandered

745
00:40:35 --> 00:40:40
into the lab and said that he
knew that we were controlling

746
00:40:40 --> 00:40:45
his mind with microwaves beamed
from this location and he

747
00:40:45 --> 00:40:49
wanted us to stop right now.
 

748
00:40:49 --> 00:40:52
I'm there sort of uh-oh.
 

749
00:40:52 --> 00:40:59
But my advisor with great
presence of mind I thought,

750
00:40:59 --> 00:41:02
walked over to the biggest rack
of equipment in the lab, threw

751
00:41:02 --> 00:41:06
the biggest switch he could
find, said there, does

752
00:41:06 --> 00:41:07
that feel better?
 

753
00:41:07 --> 00:41:12
The guy said yes and left.
 

754
00:41:12 --> 00:41:16
I'm not sure I recommend this
as a treatment for delusional

755
00:41:16 --> 00:41:19
patients, but it worked in this
-- and then we changed the

756
00:41:19 --> 00:41:20
name of the department.
 

757
00:41:20 --> 00:41:23
 
 

758
00:41:23 --> 00:41:30
In any case, it can be very
disabling and it often can

759
00:41:30 --> 00:41:33
lead to hospitalization.
 

760
00:41:33 --> 00:41:34
What would Freud
have said about it?

761
00:41:34 --> 00:41:38
What Freud said about it was
these are not patients that I

762
00:41:38 --> 00:41:39
want to deal with, basically.
 

763
00:41:39 --> 00:41:45
He doesn't write extensively
about schizophrenia and says in

764
00:41:45 --> 00:41:47
various places that look,
if you're going to do

765
00:41:47 --> 00:41:50
psychoanalysis, the first thing
you need is a patient that

766
00:41:50 --> 00:41:51
you can at least talk to.
 

767
00:41:51 --> 00:41:53
Anna O.
 

768
00:41:53 --> 00:41:55
With her collection of
hysterical symptoms may have

769
00:41:55 --> 00:42:02
been in psychiatric trouble
some variety, but you could

770
00:42:02 --> 00:42:03
talk to her about it.
 

771
00:42:03 --> 00:42:06
You could engage
in this dialogue.

772
00:42:06 --> 00:42:13
If you've got a patient who is
delusional and hallucinating

773
00:42:13 --> 00:42:16
there's not much Freud thought
you could do with them.

774
00:42:16 --> 00:42:23
However, his followers thought
you could and developed a

775
00:42:23 --> 00:42:30
theory growing out of Freudian
psychodynamic ideas of where

776
00:42:30 --> 00:42:32
schizophrenia came from.
 

777
00:42:32 --> 00:42:37
So in the mid-20th century,
psychiatric hospitals were

778
00:42:37 --> 00:42:41
filled with schizophrenics and
filled with good Freudianly

779
00:42:41 --> 00:42:45
trained analysts
attempting to treat them.

780
00:42:45 --> 00:42:50
What they thought the cause was
the so-called schizophrenogenic

781
00:42:50 --> 00:42:53
parent, typically Mother.
 

782
00:42:53 --> 00:42:58
Schizophrenogenic
is a great word.

783
00:42:58 --> 00:43:02
It's somebody who
generates schizophrenia.

784
00:43:02 --> 00:43:06
Anyway, a schizophrenogenic
mother, what was the problem

785
00:43:06 --> 00:43:12
here, the problem was what the
therapists perceived as a

786
00:43:12 --> 00:43:16
double-bind situation that
the mother was somehow

787
00:43:16 --> 00:43:17
putting the child in.
 

788
00:43:17 --> 00:43:20
The mother was saying come
here, come here, come here, go

789
00:43:20 --> 00:43:21
away, go away, go away, I love
you, I love you, I love you,

790
00:43:21 --> 00:43:23
get away, get away, get away.
 

791
00:43:23 --> 00:43:27
Somehow both saying come near
me and get away from me at one

792
00:43:27 --> 00:43:30
and the same time, and
that this was literally

793
00:43:30 --> 00:43:32
driving the child mad.
 

794
00:43:32 --> 00:43:34
Now why would they have come
up with such a theory?

795
00:43:34 --> 00:43:42
One of the reasons was that
onset of schizophrenia is quite

796
00:43:42 --> 00:43:45
typically late adolescence,
early adulthood.

797
00:43:45 --> 00:43:49
Oh, that reminds me to
reiterate or iterate for the

798
00:43:49 --> 00:43:51
first time, if I haven't
mentioned it yet -- no, I

799
00:43:51 --> 00:43:53
think I did mention it.
 

800
00:43:53 --> 00:43:57
Remember what I was saying
about psychiatric hypochondria

801
00:43:57 --> 00:44:03
-- the notion that if I sit
around and lecture about

802
00:44:03 --> 00:44:08
psychiatric disorders, you
shouldn't go and be feeling

803
00:44:08 --> 00:44:12
your brain for the rest of the
term saying oh man, I'm going

804
00:44:12 --> 00:44:14
to wake up with a dissociative
disorder tomorrow and that's

805
00:44:14 --> 00:44:16
going to progress to
schizophrenia and dimentia and

806
00:44:16 --> 00:44:19
I'm going to be dead.
 

807
00:44:19 --> 00:44:26
The fact that schizophrenia has
a typical onset in a population

808
00:44:26 --> 00:44:29
of about your age doesn't mean
that tomorrow we're going

809
00:44:29 --> 00:44:33
to have 300 schizophrenic
students in this class.

810
00:44:33 --> 00:44:34
It does happen.
 

811
00:44:34 --> 00:44:37
 
 

812
00:44:37 --> 00:44:44
What convinced me
-- a small aside.

813
00:44:44 --> 00:44:48
When you're discussing abnormal
behavior, which we are now,

814
00:44:48 --> 00:44:52
there are two senses of that.
 

815
00:44:52 --> 00:44:55
One sense of that is all
behaviors that you care

816
00:44:55 --> 00:44:58
to measure have some
variability in them.

817
00:44:58 --> 00:45:03
You can simply assert
that everybody above two

818
00:45:03 --> 00:45:06
standard deviations or
something is abnormal.

819
00:45:06 --> 00:45:13
 
 

820
00:45:13 --> 00:45:15
We'll see as we go along that
there are times when that is

821
00:45:15 --> 00:45:19
not an unreasonable
thing to do.

822
00:45:19 --> 00:45:23
There are other times when
it's a whacky thing to do.

823
00:45:23 --> 00:45:27
All right, for a wacky example,
virtually everybody here is

824
00:45:27 --> 00:45:29
abnormal in that sense,
but then the axis is

825
00:45:29 --> 00:45:31
SAT score, right.
 

826
00:45:31 --> 00:45:34
Most of you are up here in the
upper tail of the distribution.

827
00:45:34 --> 00:45:36
Sure it's abnormal but
we don't consider it as

828
00:45:36 --> 00:45:38
pathological, right?
 

829
00:45:38 --> 00:45:40
At least not in this community.
 

830
00:45:40 --> 00:45:43
 
 

831
00:45:43 --> 00:45:47
So the other possibility is
that sure, the normal

832
00:45:47 --> 00:45:52
population is distributed like
this, but there is a disease

833
00:45:52 --> 00:45:55
state of some sort that looks
like this that's essentially

834
00:45:55 --> 00:45:59
discontinuous with
the normal state.

835
00:45:59 --> 00:46:05
Arguments have been made,
notably by a psychiatrist in

836
00:46:05 --> 00:46:09
the '60s whose name is probably
pronounced something like

837
00:46:09 --> 00:46:11
Shosh -- a Hungarian name.
 

838
00:46:11 --> 00:46:14
Anybody happen to know
the right answer?

839
00:46:14 --> 00:46:19
Anyway, Thomas Szasz will
do or Shosh or something.

840
00:46:19 --> 00:46:23
In any case, he made the
argument that in a book

841
00:46:23 --> 00:46:26
entitled Being Sane in an
Insane World, that

842
00:46:26 --> 00:46:29
schizophrenia was simply a way
to adapt to the fact that the

843
00:46:29 --> 00:46:32
Russians had lots of bombs and
we had lots of bombs and we

844
00:46:32 --> 00:46:34
were all going to blow each
other up, and that it was

845
00:46:34 --> 00:46:39
just one position on
this normal curve.

846
00:46:39 --> 00:46:41
It's an interesting argument.
 

847
00:46:41 --> 00:46:46
But if you actually see
somebody in the midst of a

848
00:46:46 --> 00:46:53
florid schizophrenic break from
reality, it's hard to believe.

849
00:46:53 --> 00:46:56
I had, when I was an
undergraduate, the roommate

850
00:46:56 --> 00:47:00
of a close friend of
mine had such a break.

851
00:47:00 --> 00:47:04
It's unmistakable -- it's
at once fascinating and

852
00:47:04 --> 00:47:06
deeply frightening.
 

853
00:47:06 --> 00:47:10
This was a friend of ours who
became delusional -- she was

854
00:47:10 --> 00:47:16
hallucinating, she absolutely
couldn't function, and was

855
00:47:16 --> 00:47:19
scaring the heck out of her
roommate and she eventually

856
00:47:19 --> 00:47:24
-- actually, she
eventually did fine.

857
00:47:24 --> 00:47:28
We caught up with her like
twenty years later, and people

858
00:47:28 --> 00:47:31
do recover from schizophrenia
and she was doing quite

859
00:47:31 --> 00:47:31
well, thank you.
 

860
00:47:31 --> 00:47:35
But in any case, she was the
data point, that at least

861
00:47:35 --> 00:47:39
for me, argued strongly for
the notion that this is a

862
00:47:39 --> 00:47:48
different state, not just
a position on a continuum.

863
00:47:48 --> 00:47:52
In any case, the psychiatrists
were busy trying to treat

864
00:47:52 --> 00:47:58
this with sor of Freudian
psychotherapeutic techniques.

865
00:47:58 --> 00:48:00
It wasn't working.
 

866
00:48:00 --> 00:48:02
This wasn't because they were
bad people -- these were

867
00:48:02 --> 00:48:07
well-intentioned people doing
the best by their lights that

868
00:48:07 --> 00:48:08
they could, it just
wasn't working.

869
00:48:08 --> 00:48:11
It was a case where the
theory was just wrong.

870
00:48:11 --> 00:48:15
Oh, one of the engines that
moved theory away from this,

871
00:48:15 --> 00:48:20
by the way, were parent
advocacy groups.

872
00:48:20 --> 00:48:27
You've got to imagine that
having a seriously ill child,

873
00:48:27 --> 00:48:29
whether that's a physical
illness or a mental

874
00:48:29 --> 00:48:34
illness, is very traumatic
for parents, period.

875
00:48:34 --> 00:48:40
But imagine how you would feel
if the leading theory was that

876
00:48:40 --> 00:48:45
this was your fault, that you
had done this to your child.

877
00:48:45 --> 00:48:49
Not intentionally, of course,
but it was you who had done it.

878
00:48:49 --> 00:48:51
Parents simply
didn't believe it.

879
00:48:51 --> 00:48:54
And as science started to
emerge suggesting that in

880
00:48:54 --> 00:48:57
schizophrenia's case it was
much more like a brain disease

881
00:48:57 --> 00:49:05
than like the product of bad
mothering, that groups, funding

882
00:49:05 --> 00:49:08
groups -- you know, the guys
who send you lots of mail at

883
00:49:08 --> 00:49:11
this time of year saying send
us your check and we'll support

884
00:49:11 --> 00:49:16
good research on this disease
that disease or whatever, a

885
00:49:16 --> 00:49:20
number of these groups powered
by parents of schizophrenics

886
00:49:20 --> 00:49:23
were helping to move the
research away from the notion

887
00:49:23 --> 00:49:25
of a schizophrenogenic mother.
 

888
00:49:25 --> 00:49:27
But what really did it
was it just didn't work.

889
00:49:27 --> 00:49:31
Nobody could make
this story work.

890
00:49:31 --> 00:49:38
The psychiatric hospitals are
no longer filled with

891
00:49:38 --> 00:49:42
schizophrenic patients, and
that's not because of a great

892
00:49:42 --> 00:49:45
breakthrough in Freudian
psychotherapy, it's

893
00:49:45 --> 00:49:47
because of drugs.
 

894
00:49:47 --> 00:49:51
In the '50s drugs like
Thorazine, Chlorpromazine

895
00:49:51 --> 00:49:56
is the technical name,
came on the market.

896
00:49:56 --> 00:50:02
In this particular case these
are drugs that block dopamine

897
00:50:02 --> 00:50:05
receptors -- dopamine's a neuro
transmitter, the receptor on

898
00:50:05 --> 00:50:07
the other side of the synapse.
 

899
00:50:07 --> 00:50:17
Thorazine decreased the uptake
of dopamine, and that served to

900
00:50:17 --> 00:50:21
ameliorate the florid symptoms
of schizophrenia,

901
00:50:21 --> 00:50:22
in particular.
 

902
00:50:22 --> 00:50:25
You put somebody on Thorazine
and they didn't hallucinate

903
00:50:25 --> 00:50:30
anymore, and their paranoid
dilusions slipped away.

904
00:50:30 --> 00:50:35
Oh, let me tell you another
anecdote about schizophrenics.

905
00:50:35 --> 00:50:37
Schizophrenics I have known.
 

906
00:50:37 --> 00:50:42
We had a very interesting woman
who was the librarian in the

907
00:50:42 --> 00:50:52
department here some years ago
-- PhD Classicist and also, she

908
00:50:52 --> 00:50:58
was schizophrenic and
successfully medicated and

909
00:50:58 --> 00:51:03
functioned well as the psych
department librarian

910
00:51:03 --> 00:51:06
when on medication.
 

911
00:51:06 --> 00:51:09
Anytime I tell you the root of
something like schizophrenia,

912
00:51:09 --> 00:51:12
the Latin and Greek roots of
these words, it's because I'm

913
00:51:12 --> 00:51:15
remembering what she taught me.
 

914
00:51:15 --> 00:51:19
But she would slip off
of her medication.

915
00:51:19 --> 00:51:22
You could tell when she was
slipping off her medication

916
00:51:22 --> 00:51:25
because her handwriting, her
handwritten notes would start

917
00:51:25 --> 00:51:27
getting smaller and smaller
and longer and longer.

918
00:51:27 --> 00:51:31
She developed this
micro-writing and very

919
00:51:31 --> 00:51:33
extensive writing, and
then the content would

920
00:51:33 --> 00:51:35
start to slip, too.
 

921
00:51:35 --> 00:51:39
And she would also start -- if
it got dim in the library you

922
00:51:39 --> 00:51:43
knew you were in for trouble
because she became photophobic.

923
00:51:43 --> 00:51:46
One of the interesting problems
here and one of the problems in

924
00:51:46 --> 00:51:49
treatment was that as she fell
off her medicine she

925
00:51:49 --> 00:51:50
became paranoid.
 

926
00:51:50 --> 00:51:52
What was the nature
of her paranoia?

927
00:51:52 --> 00:51:55
The nature of her paranoia was
that people wanted to control

928
00:51:55 --> 00:51:56
her brain using chemicals.
 

929
00:51:56 --> 00:51:58
Well that was exactly true.
 

930
00:51:58 --> 00:52:01
But if we would tell her, you
gotta start taking your

931
00:52:01 --> 00:52:04
medicine, that was just
evidence for her that we

932
00:52:04 --> 00:52:07
were trying to control her
brain, which was true.

933
00:52:07 --> 00:52:11
So it wasn't even really --
it's very tricky stuff.

934
00:52:11 --> 00:52:14
I mean it's funny and
sad at the same time.

935
00:52:14 --> 00:52:18
Eventually, she was no longer
able to control this and

936
00:52:18 --> 00:52:24
was no longer able to hold
the job, which was sad.

937
00:52:24 --> 00:52:29
But it's also a real issue, a
real medical ethics issue.

938
00:52:29 --> 00:52:35
When the hospitals were emptied
by these drugs, the promise was

939
00:52:35 --> 00:52:38
that supports would be placed
in the community that would it

940
00:52:38 --> 00:52:45
make it possible for medicated
schizophrenics to function.

941
00:52:45 --> 00:52:47
It's not a cure because the
medicines are imperfect.

942
00:52:47 --> 00:52:51
For instance, it's not the case
that dopamine -- the problem in

943
00:52:51 --> 00:52:54
schizophrenia isn't that
dopamine is bad stuff and if

944
00:52:54 --> 00:52:56
you have lots of it
you're in trouble.

945
00:52:56 --> 00:52:59
It is clear that in
schizophrenia, bits of the

946
00:52:59 --> 00:53:03
brain are awash in too much
dopamine, but if you wipe out

947
00:53:03 --> 00:53:06
-- if you just blanket, push
down dopamine, other bits of

948
00:53:06 --> 00:53:10
the brain which really like
dopamine are starved for it.

949
00:53:10 --> 00:53:14
The sorts of symptoms that you
get when dopamine is removed

950
00:53:14 --> 00:53:16
from these chunks of the brain
are the symptoms of Parkinson's

951
00:53:16 --> 00:53:20
disease -- muscle tremors, an
inability to initiate

952
00:53:20 --> 00:53:22
voluntary activity.
 

953
00:53:22 --> 00:53:27
So a patient overmedicated on
Thorazine isn't hallucinating

954
00:53:27 --> 00:53:30
anymore, but is also
sort of inert.

955
00:53:30 --> 00:53:33
So it's not trivial to
just say take this pill,

956
00:53:33 --> 00:53:34
great you're cured.
 

957
00:53:34 --> 00:53:37
It was clear that management
was going to be needed.

958
00:53:37 --> 00:53:39
It was clear in many cases that
people were going to need

959
00:53:39 --> 00:53:43
housing that was like sort of
halfway housing, not complete

960
00:53:43 --> 00:53:48
independence, but you could be
out in the world and you

961
00:53:48 --> 00:53:50
wouldn't need to be
hospitalized anymore but you'd

962
00:53:50 --> 00:53:52
need some sort of
continuing care.

963
00:53:52 --> 00:53:57
The problem is that we've
systematically not given

964
00:53:57 --> 00:54:01
enough, basically money
and resources to that.

965
00:54:01 --> 00:54:09
The result is there are numbers
of imperfectly -- perfect

966
00:54:09 --> 00:54:16
medication isn't out there yet
-- but inadequately medicated,

967
00:54:16 --> 00:54:19
unsuccessfully medicated
patients who ought to be cared

968
00:54:19 --> 00:54:24
for, but who are not being
cared for for by the system.

969
00:54:24 --> 00:54:28
 
 

970
00:54:28 --> 00:54:30
Schizophrenics are
over-represented in the

971
00:54:30 --> 00:54:35
homeless population because if
you are not successfully

972
00:54:35 --> 00:54:40
medicated it's hard to hold a
job, it's hard to keep an

973
00:54:40 --> 00:54:43
apartment or something
like that and you end

974
00:54:43 --> 00:54:44
up on the street.
 

975
00:54:44 --> 00:54:47
That loops back to this issue
about your paranoid delusion

976
00:54:47 --> 00:54:50
about somebody trying
to control your mind.

977
00:54:50 --> 00:54:54
When is it OK then, now that
you're on the street, now that

978
00:54:54 --> 00:54:58
you're floridly schizophrenic
again, when is it OK for us as

979
00:54:58 --> 00:55:01
a society to come in and say
guess what, we don't care that

980
00:55:01 --> 00:55:03
you think we're trying to
control your mind, we're going

981
00:55:03 --> 00:55:06
to medicate you whether you
want to or not because

982
00:55:06 --> 00:55:08
it's for your own good.
 

983
00:55:08 --> 00:55:11
You can argue yeah, it's for
your own good, but there's lots

984
00:55:11 --> 00:55:14
of things that -- you know, I
might decide it's for your own

985
00:55:14 --> 00:55:16
good that you should sleep
eight hours a night.

986
00:55:16 --> 00:55:18
Do I get to enforce that?
 

987
00:55:18 --> 00:55:20
No, I don't.
 

988
00:55:20 --> 00:55:24
If I decide that it's good for
you to take a drug that is

989
00:55:24 --> 00:55:28
going to, in fact, control your
mind, when do I get to do that,

990
00:55:28 --> 00:55:31
and this ends up in court
regularly, and it ends up on

991
00:55:31 --> 00:55:34
talk radio all the time, right,
because it's a sort of thing

992
00:55:34 --> 00:55:37
that yakking head talk radio
loves to get excited about.

993
00:55:37 --> 00:55:43
You know some judge declares
that some clearly schizophrenic

994
00:55:43 --> 00:55:48
individual has a constitutional
right to live under a bridge

995
00:55:48 --> 00:55:55
yelling obscenities at you,
and talk radio goes nuts.

996
00:55:55 --> 00:55:57
It's an interesting question.
 

997
00:55:57 --> 00:56:00
It's not a question
with an easy answer.

998
00:56:00 --> 00:56:04
When do you get to decide that
you're allowed to take control

999
00:56:04 --> 00:56:10
over somebody else's
mental life?

1000
00:56:10 --> 00:56:19
At the present, the view of
schizophrenia is, as I say,

1001
00:56:19 --> 00:56:21
much more that it's a
distinct state of brain

1002
00:56:21 --> 00:56:22
disease of some sort.
 

1003
00:56:22 --> 00:56:23
What might cause it?
 

1004
00:56:23 --> 00:56:30
Well, the fact that a pill that
reduces the effects of dopamine

1005
00:56:30 --> 00:56:32
does something tends to suggest
to people that there's a

1006
00:56:32 --> 00:56:35
biological cause there.
 

1007
00:56:35 --> 00:56:37
In the case of schizophrenia
that well maybe true, but it's

1008
00:56:37 --> 00:56:40
important to note that that
doesn't need to be true.

1009
00:56:40 --> 00:56:44
Things that are cured or
symptoms that are cured by

1010
00:56:44 --> 00:56:48
pills aren't necessarily
symptoms that are caused by bad

1011
00:56:48 --> 00:56:53
genes or bacteria or some
biological story like that.

1012
00:56:53 --> 00:56:56
A perfectly nice example
is motion sickness.

1013
00:56:56 --> 00:56:59
You go on an airplane, you get
bounced around, you throw up.

1014
00:56:59 --> 00:57:01
What are you going
to do about this?

1015
00:57:01 --> 00:57:05
Well, you can take scopolamine
or meclizine that's Bonine --

1016
00:57:05 --> 00:57:09
Bonine is meclizine and
dramamine is scopolamine -- two

1017
00:57:09 --> 00:57:13
perfectly nice drugs that
affect your vestibular system,

1018
00:57:13 --> 00:57:16
and they will keep you
from getting motion sick.

1019
00:57:16 --> 00:57:19
That's not because you've got
bad motion sickness genes or

1020
00:57:19 --> 00:57:22
you got the motion
sickness bacteria.

1021
00:57:22 --> 00:57:25
It's a biological treatment,
if you like, for

1022
00:57:25 --> 00:57:29
an environmentally
caused disorder.

1023
00:57:29 --> 00:57:35
I point that out only to make
the point that what cures or

1024
00:57:35 --> 00:57:38
treats a disorder doesn't
necessarily tell you

1025
00:57:38 --> 00:57:40
what the cause is.
 

1026
00:57:40 --> 00:57:44
There's not one-to-one mapping
there -- that's important

1027
00:57:44 --> 00:57:46
to keep in mind.
 

1028
00:57:46 --> 00:57:48
But the drugs certainly do
help with the symptoms.

1029
00:57:48 --> 00:57:54
What psychopharmacologists
work on a lot now is getting

1030
00:57:54 --> 00:57:56
drugs that work better.
 

1031
00:57:56 --> 00:57:59
All right, we want to reduce
dopamine here but not here.

1032
00:57:59 --> 00:58:02
Well it turns out that there's
a bunch of different dopamine

1033
00:58:02 --> 00:58:05
receptors -- let's make a drug
that only acts at this location

1034
00:58:05 --> 00:58:07
and not at this location.
 

1035
00:58:07 --> 00:58:12
That's a sort of project that
psychopharmacology works

1036
00:58:12 --> 00:58:14
on at the present time.
 

1037
00:58:14 --> 00:58:20
But I want to go back and talk
about the possible causes of

1038
00:58:20 --> 00:58:24
mental illness, but I'll do
that after we take a

1039
00:58:24 --> 00:58:25
brief break here.
 

1040
00:58:25 --> 01:00:09
 
 

1041
01:00:09 --> 01:00:10
OK.
 

1042
01:00:10 --> 01:00:16
What I want to do with the
remaining portion, probably all

1043
01:00:16 --> 01:00:21
of the remaining portion, of
today's lecture is to make two

1044
01:00:21 --> 01:00:25
points, which I have
already alluded to.

1045
01:00:25 --> 01:00:29
One of them is that there are
multiple roots into mental

1046
01:00:29 --> 01:00:33
illness, not just any sort of
single root, and you're going

1047
01:00:33 --> 01:00:36
to need to work this out
on a case-by-case basis.

1048
01:00:36 --> 01:00:42
The other related point is that
the border between normal and

1049
01:00:42 --> 01:00:46
abnormal is not necessarily
a sharp clearly marked one.

1050
01:00:46 --> 01:00:50
Oh, by the way, if you're
interested in this latter

1051
01:00:50 --> 01:00:54
point, there's an article in
today's New York Times science

1052
01:00:54 --> 01:00:58
section about really exactly
this point in the context of

1053
01:00:58 --> 01:01:01
eating disorders -- a topic
that I hope to get to before

1054
01:01:01 --> 01:01:07
the end of the course -- where
it's very important to be

1055
01:01:07 --> 01:01:13
able to give a label to
psychiatric conditions.

1056
01:01:13 --> 01:01:15
Why is that important?
 

1057
01:01:15 --> 01:01:20
In part it's important because
third party payers will pay if

1058
01:01:20 --> 01:01:23
you have a disorder, but they
won't pay if you're

1059
01:01:23 --> 01:01:26
just feeling a little
screwed up, right.

1060
01:01:26 --> 01:01:28
So you gotta have a
labeled disorder.

1061
01:01:28 --> 01:01:33
So, there's been a big movement
within the American Psychiatric

1062
01:01:33 --> 01:01:37
establishment to come up with
clear diagnostic criteria.

1063
01:01:37 --> 01:01:40
The nice thing about, you know
you go into your pediatrician

1064
01:01:40 --> 01:01:45
and getting a throat culture
for strep is that I can grow it

1065
01:01:45 --> 01:01:49
in the lab, and if you got
strep you got strep, and I'd

1066
01:01:49 --> 01:01:51
give you something for strep.
 

1067
01:01:51 --> 01:01:55
Mental illness is almost
never like that.

1068
01:01:55 --> 01:01:58
You got some collection of
symptoms, are they adequate

1069
01:01:58 --> 01:02:03
to get you the definition
of this disease?

1070
01:02:03 --> 01:02:09
The Times article is pointing
out that therapists are having

1071
01:02:09 --> 01:02:14
a real problems with people who
any idiot can see has, let's

1072
01:02:14 --> 01:02:18
say, an eating disorder, but
the official criteria for

1073
01:02:18 --> 01:02:24
anorexia nervosa, the eating
disorder of self-starvation,

1074
01:02:24 --> 01:02:27
are you have to have boom,
boom, boom, boom and boom.

1075
01:02:27 --> 01:02:30
Well, if you're missing
that boom, you can't

1076
01:02:30 --> 01:02:32
make the diagnosis.
 

1077
01:02:32 --> 01:02:34
What do you call them now?
 

1078
01:02:34 --> 01:02:36
Anyway, so today's New York
Times science section,

1079
01:02:36 --> 01:02:38
go check it out.
 

1080
01:02:38 --> 01:02:43
In the meantime, let us return
to 1900 to talk a bit about

1081
01:02:43 --> 01:02:47
possible causes of
mental illness.

1082
01:02:47 --> 01:02:54
In 1900 half the patients in
American mental hospitals

1083
01:02:54 --> 01:02:57
had a disorder known as
dementia paralytica.

1084
01:02:57 --> 01:02:59
This is the bad stuff.
 

1085
01:02:59 --> 01:03:04
It's a disorder that starts
with mania and grandiosity

1086
01:03:04 --> 01:03:05
as its symptoms.
 

1087
01:03:05 --> 01:03:09
 
 

1088
01:03:09 --> 01:03:15
If you think that you are Jesus
and that you can turn water

1089
01:03:15 --> 01:03:19
into wine and stuff like that,
except in the rare case where

1090
01:03:19 --> 01:03:25
that turns out to be true or
something, it's a psychiatric

1091
01:03:25 --> 01:03:32
symptom and it would be a
manic symptom of some sort.

1092
01:03:32 --> 01:03:35
If you think you're the
reincarnation of Napoleon and

1093
01:03:35 --> 01:03:39
this time you're going to get
the invasion of Russia right or

1094
01:03:39 --> 01:03:41
something like that, you know,
that's the sort of thing that

1095
01:03:41 --> 01:03:44
gets you into psychiatric care.
 

1096
01:03:44 --> 01:03:49
In the case of dimentia
paralytica, it then

1097
01:03:49 --> 01:03:51
proceeded to the other
two bits of the name.

1098
01:03:51 --> 01:03:55
Dementia, people became
demented, they then became

1099
01:03:55 --> 01:03:58
paralyzed, lost control their
muscles and then they died.

1100
01:03:58 --> 01:04:02
This is not a good disorder.
 

1101
01:04:02 --> 01:04:04
It has disappeared essentially.
 

1102
01:04:04 --> 01:04:07
Why?
 

1103
01:04:07 --> 01:04:11
Does anybody happen
to know the answer?

1104
01:04:11 --> 01:04:12
Yes.
 

1105
01:04:12 --> 01:04:14
Which person?
 

1106
01:04:14 --> 01:04:16
What are you looking
behind you for?

1107
01:04:16 --> 01:04:19
How many people are
wearing witchy hats?

1108
01:04:19 --> 01:04:22
 
 

1109
01:04:22 --> 01:04:27
How long have you thought
you were a witch?

1110
01:04:27 --> 01:04:29
Anyway, you were saying.
 

1111
01:04:29 --> 01:04:35
AUDIENCE: This is caused by
bacteria I think, or something

1112
01:04:35 --> 01:04:37
that they like [INAUDIBLE].
 

1113
01:04:37 --> 01:04:39
PROFESSOR: Well, all right.
 

1114
01:04:39 --> 01:04:42
The problem is people know
too much around here.

1115
01:04:42 --> 01:04:45
You can fish around for all
sorts of interesting answers,

1116
01:04:45 --> 01:04:47
like one of the possible
reasons for a diagnosis to

1117
01:04:47 --> 01:04:50
disappear is you fractionate
the disorder into a bunch of

1118
01:04:50 --> 01:04:53
other stuff and we've now
renamed it and this is now

1119
01:04:53 --> 01:04:55
called Alzheimers and
a few other things.

1120
01:04:55 --> 01:04:57
But no, in fact, this is
an outside pathogen.

1121
01:04:57 --> 01:05:03
In this case, dementia
paralytica was the result of

1122
01:05:03 --> 01:05:06
tertiary third stage syphilis.
 

1123
01:05:06 --> 01:05:09
The reason you don't see it
anymore is that nobody gets to

1124
01:05:09 --> 01:05:11
third stage syphilis anymore.
 

1125
01:05:11 --> 01:05:15
If you show up with symptoms of
syphilis somebody treats you.

1126
01:05:15 --> 01:05:18
This was the result, by
the time the organism had

1127
01:05:18 --> 01:05:21
gotten to your brain and
chewed up your brain.

1128
01:05:21 --> 01:05:23
 
 

1129
01:05:23 --> 01:05:26
So it disappeared
with treatment.

1130
01:05:26 --> 01:05:31
But it points out is that one
of the roots to mental illness

1131
01:05:31 --> 01:05:37
is an assault, a biological
assault from the outside.

1132
01:05:37 --> 01:05:41
 
 

1133
01:05:41 --> 01:05:48
So there are theories, unproven
theories that a rise in autism,

1134
01:05:48 --> 01:05:51
that's been seen in this
country over the last couple of

1135
01:05:51 --> 01:05:55
generations, is due to some
sort of external insult to the

1136
01:05:55 --> 01:06:00
nervous system, not clear what
it is, but there are proposals

1137
01:06:00 --> 01:06:01
out there that something
that we're doing to the

1138
01:06:01 --> 01:06:06
environment is causing
more autism, for example.

1139
01:06:06 --> 01:06:08
 
 

1140
01:06:08 --> 01:06:11
But this is an example of
a clearly biologically

1141
01:06:11 --> 01:06:16
rooted mental illness.
 

1142
01:06:16 --> 01:06:18
 
 

1143
01:06:18 --> 01:06:25
Perhaps the extreme other end
of the scale would be -- well,

1144
01:06:25 --> 01:06:26
it's more like a triangle.
 

1145
01:06:26 --> 01:06:37
We could have biology, we could
have an environmental disorder,

1146
01:06:37 --> 01:06:40
and we could have what you
might consider to be a

1147
01:06:40 --> 01:06:43
societally defined disorder.
 

1148
01:06:43 --> 01:06:48
The distinction here is this is
a case where the environment

1149
01:06:48 --> 01:06:52
somehow really does make you
insane, and this is a case

1150
01:06:52 --> 01:06:56
where we take the normal
distribution and declare the

1151
01:06:56 --> 01:07:00
upper tail of the distribution
to be a psychopathology

1152
01:07:00 --> 01:07:02
of some sort.
 

1153
01:07:02 --> 01:07:05
So let's look for examples
of both of these.

1154
01:07:05 --> 01:07:08
A perfectly nice example -- not
nice -- an example of an

1155
01:07:08 --> 01:07:15
environmental disorder would be
what was called shell-shock in

1156
01:07:15 --> 01:07:19
World War I and would now
probably be more generally

1157
01:07:19 --> 01:07:23
lumped under the category of
traumatic stress disorder.

1158
01:07:23 --> 01:07:35
Exposure to extreme stress and
being shot at can produce

1159
01:07:35 --> 01:07:39
a range of disabling
psychiatric symptoms.

1160
01:07:39 --> 01:07:45
So, in World War I when people
were fighting this insane

1161
01:07:45 --> 01:07:50
warfare of having vast numbers
of people in entrenched

1162
01:07:50 --> 01:07:55
positions shelling each other
and just charging at each

1163
01:07:55 --> 01:08:00
other, some fraction
of the population of

1164
01:08:00 --> 01:08:02
soldiers cracked up.
 

1165
01:08:02 --> 01:08:04
They just couldn't function.
 

1166
01:08:04 --> 01:08:07
They would cry hysterically,
they would just lie there

1167
01:08:07 --> 01:08:10
and not do anything.
 

1168
01:08:10 --> 01:08:15
The first reaction of the
military to such things is

1169
01:08:15 --> 01:08:18
to decide that this is
insubordination and to shoot

1170
01:08:18 --> 01:08:22
you or something of that sort
for failing to obey orders.

1171
01:08:22 --> 01:08:28
But it became clear to medical
folks during World War I that

1172
01:08:28 --> 01:08:33
this was not a voluntary act,
this was a psychiatric problem.

1173
01:08:33 --> 01:08:38
 
 

1174
01:08:38 --> 01:08:42
They went and pulled people
back behind the lines, worked

1175
01:08:42 --> 01:08:45
very hard to treat them so that
they could return them to the

1176
01:08:45 --> 01:08:49
war in a sort of a sick irony.
 

1177
01:08:49 --> 01:08:56
But this is a disorder that
is clearly environmental.

1178
01:08:56 --> 01:09:00
Now there's probably some --
not everybody who's placed

1179
01:09:00 --> 01:09:05
under stress produces a post
traumatic stress disorder, so

1180
01:09:05 --> 01:09:09
it's clear that there's some
underlying variation of unknown

1181
01:09:09 --> 01:09:12
nature that makes some people
vulnerable to it and

1182
01:09:12 --> 01:09:13
some people not.
 

1183
01:09:13 --> 01:09:17
But the precipitating cause
here is environmental.

1184
01:09:17 --> 01:09:21
Now this is something that's
a topic of a lot of current

1185
01:09:21 --> 01:09:27
interest in psychiatry and
in clinical psychology.

1186
01:09:27 --> 01:09:31
Because as it's been
appreciated that this sort of

1187
01:09:31 --> 01:09:39
trauma does produce psychiatric
symptoms, efforts are made to

1188
01:09:39 --> 01:09:42
prevent this when it's clear
it's going to happen.

1189
01:09:42 --> 01:09:48
So, first responders, the
police and firemen who are

1190
01:09:48 --> 01:09:51
going to be the first guys that
crash scenes or into burning

1191
01:09:51 --> 01:09:56
buildings, are going to see
really terrible stuff, and it's

1192
01:09:56 --> 01:10:01
known that that's going to
produce a collection of

1193
01:10:01 --> 01:10:02
psychiatric symptoms.
 

1194
01:10:02 --> 01:10:07
So, an interesting question is
well if you know that, what

1195
01:10:07 --> 01:10:11
could you do perhaps to
ameliorate the situation?

1196
01:10:11 --> 01:10:16
One very popular idea has been
that after a crisis -- I mean

1197
01:10:16 --> 01:10:23
you hear this all the time when
something really bad happens

1198
01:10:23 --> 01:10:26
like a school shooting or
something, one of the things

1199
01:10:26 --> 01:10:28
you do is you immediately pour
in a bunch of therapists, and

1200
01:10:28 --> 01:10:32
the idea is is you get people
together to talk about it.

1201
01:10:32 --> 01:10:35
One particular modality of
therapy is you basically get

1202
01:10:35 --> 01:10:40
all your firefighters who were
at this scene into a room

1203
01:10:40 --> 01:10:45
together to talk it through,
and that this has been proposed

1204
01:10:45 --> 01:10:49
as a mechanism for preventing
these stress disorders.

1205
01:10:49 --> 01:10:53
Unfortunately, a big study
came out last year suggesting

1206
01:10:53 --> 01:10:56
sounds lovely, doesn't work.
 

1207
01:10:56 --> 01:10:59
Not that it does anything
particularly bad or anything,

1208
01:10:59 --> 01:11:01
it just doesn't work.
 

1209
01:11:01 --> 01:11:05
 
 

1210
01:11:05 --> 01:11:10
What it points out is that the
state of the art is a little

1211
01:11:10 --> 01:11:12
like the problem I was talking
about with Freudian attempts

1212
01:11:12 --> 01:11:16
to explain schizophrenia.
 

1213
01:11:16 --> 01:11:21
These are difficult problems
where good well-meaning

1214
01:11:21 --> 01:11:25
clinicians try stuff out that
doesn't necessarily work.

1215
01:11:25 --> 01:11:28
Very hard to get a clear
feeling from this, from reading

1216
01:11:28 --> 01:11:32
the popular press where you get
one miracle cure after the

1217
01:11:32 --> 01:11:36
other and then the miracle cure
fades away, but it fades away

1218
01:11:36 --> 01:11:38
in the literature somewhere --
you don't get to see this very

1219
01:11:38 --> 01:11:43
clearly if you just sit there
reading the science section

1220
01:11:43 --> 01:11:48
of Time magazine or
something of that sort.

1221
01:11:48 --> 01:11:55
Anyway, so third stage syphilis
munches up your mind, trench

1222
01:11:55 --> 01:11:58
warfare munches up your mind.
 

1223
01:11:58 --> 01:12:05
Are there diseases that are
defined purely by society

1224
01:12:05 --> 01:12:08
and what does that mean?
 

1225
01:12:08 --> 01:12:09
Are those legitimate?
 

1226
01:12:09 --> 01:12:12
Well, let's talk about one
that's not terribly legitimate.

1227
01:12:12 --> 01:12:16
I don't think anybody here is
deeply familiar with the

1228
01:12:16 --> 01:12:19
disorder called drapetomania.
 

1229
01:12:19 --> 01:12:22
Any drapetomania experts?
 

1230
01:12:22 --> 01:12:23
No.
 

1231
01:12:23 --> 01:12:25
OK.
 

1232
01:12:25 --> 01:12:28
Any Greek scholars?
 

1233
01:12:28 --> 01:12:28
No.
 

1234
01:12:28 --> 01:12:30
So we're not going to
get anybody to tell

1235
01:12:30 --> 01:12:31
us what the root is.
 

1236
01:12:31 --> 01:12:35
So, it's not a manic
desire to put up drapes.

1237
01:12:35 --> 01:12:40
It's drapeto comes from a
Greek root having to do

1238
01:12:40 --> 01:12:45
with wandering off, and the
mania's the mania part.

1239
01:12:45 --> 01:12:48
So it's an insane
desire to wander away.

1240
01:12:48 --> 01:12:51
All right, that sounds
like it could be insane.

1241
01:12:51 --> 01:12:57
This is a disorder discovered
by a doctor named Cartwright

1242
01:12:57 --> 01:13:02
in Louisiana in the 1840s.
 

1243
01:13:02 --> 01:13:06
He writes about it in a
book endearingly titled,

1244
01:13:06 --> 01:13:09
Peculiarities of
the Negro Race.

1245
01:13:09 --> 01:13:13
So you need to think --
all right, time to review

1246
01:13:13 --> 01:13:15
your AP American history.
 

1247
01:13:15 --> 01:13:18
Right, 1840s, Louisiana.
 

1248
01:13:18 --> 01:13:23
If you are a member of the
negro race you are what?

1249
01:13:23 --> 01:13:24
A slave.
 

1250
01:13:24 --> 01:13:26
If you are a slave
you might do what?

1251
01:13:26 --> 01:13:30
 
 

1252
01:13:30 --> 01:13:36
Well you might wander
off or run away.

1253
01:13:36 --> 01:13:38
It wasn't that Cartwright
discovered this.

1254
01:13:38 --> 01:13:40
People knew that
slaves ran away.

1255
01:13:40 --> 01:13:44
But rather like earlier
attitudes towards people

1256
01:13:44 --> 01:13:47
cracking up on the battlefield,
the standard attitude towards

1257
01:13:47 --> 01:13:52
the slave that ran away
was that's a bad slave.

1258
01:13:52 --> 01:13:57
Right, he's just bad, and what
we should do is catch him

1259
01:13:57 --> 01:14:00
and beat him and put
him back to work.

1260
01:14:00 --> 01:14:05
Cartwright was an odd sort of
liberal from the sound of it in

1261
01:14:05 --> 01:14:09
the sense that he said, no,
no, no, no, no -- they're

1262
01:14:09 --> 01:14:11
not bad, they're sick.
 

1263
01:14:11 --> 01:14:16
Because after all, as he
understood it, the proper place

1264
01:14:16 --> 01:14:21
for a slave for an African
American was to be

1265
01:14:21 --> 01:14:22
a slave, right?
 

1266
01:14:22 --> 01:14:28
So if you wandered off,
you weren't being a

1267
01:14:28 --> 01:14:29
healthy, normal slave.
 

1268
01:14:29 --> 01:14:33
You'd gone up here somewhere
and you were being abnormal.

1269
01:14:33 --> 01:14:36
He also, by the way, had a
lovely biological theory about

1270
01:14:36 --> 01:14:41
the cause of this, which
was decarbonized blood.

1271
01:14:41 --> 01:14:44
I don't know, it sounds like it
would do something bad to me.

1272
01:14:44 --> 01:14:48
 
 

1273
01:14:48 --> 01:14:50
And he had a treatment regimen.
 

1274
01:14:50 --> 01:14:53
Remember that the standard
treatment for a slave who ran

1275
01:14:53 --> 01:14:59
away was catch him, beat him
and put him back to work.

1276
01:14:59 --> 01:15:05
Cartwright said, when you catch
him, what you need to do is

1277
01:15:05 --> 01:15:09
slap some oil in with a broad
leather strap and

1278
01:15:09 --> 01:15:10
put him to work.
 

1279
01:15:10 --> 01:15:12
All right, so the treatment
didn't sound all

1280
01:15:12 --> 01:15:13
that different.
 

1281
01:15:13 --> 01:15:20
In any case, it's a pretty
clear case of a disorder

1282
01:15:20 --> 01:15:24
defined entirely by society.
 

1283
01:15:24 --> 01:15:26
There's not a -- I don't
know, decarbonized

1284
01:15:26 --> 01:15:27
blood not withstanding.
 

1285
01:15:27 --> 01:15:31
There's not an organism there.
 

1286
01:15:31 --> 01:15:34
There's not -- well, you can
think of the environment as

1287
01:15:34 --> 01:15:37
causing the slave to run
away, but not in the sense

1288
01:15:37 --> 01:15:39
of causing a disorder.
 

1289
01:15:39 --> 01:15:43
We would consider this to be
essentially a normal -- we'd be

1290
01:15:43 --> 01:15:45
with Thomas Szasz on that,
that's a sane reaction to an

1291
01:15:45 --> 01:15:52
insane world, perhaps, to be
a slave and to run away.

1292
01:15:52 --> 01:15:57
Now, you might argue that we
don't do that anymore, but

1293
01:15:57 --> 01:16:02
if you were to, say, OK,
what this is, is weight.

1294
01:16:02 --> 01:16:06
Let's make this normal
distribution weight.

1295
01:16:06 --> 01:16:11
The Surgeon General is
perfectly happy and all sorts

1296
01:16:11 --> 01:16:14
of outfits are perfectly happy
to declare that if you're above

1297
01:16:14 --> 01:16:17
this level whatever it
is, you're abnormal,

1298
01:16:17 --> 01:16:20
you're overweight.
 

1299
01:16:20 --> 01:16:24
And there are plenty of
theories, folks psychological

1300
01:16:24 --> 01:16:28
and otherwise, that basically
give a psychiatric spin to

1301
01:16:28 --> 01:16:30
what's going on there, right.
 

1302
01:16:30 --> 01:16:36
If you've heard theories of
obesity being -- there are pop

1303
01:16:36 --> 01:16:39
theories that oh, they're
overcompensating -- that

1304
01:16:39 --> 01:16:41
they're eating to substitute
for the lack of love in their

1305
01:16:41 --> 01:16:46
life, or it's a lack of
self-control, or it's because

1306
01:16:46 --> 01:16:50
they have gene for fatness.
 

1307
01:16:50 --> 01:16:52
All of this might be
true at some level.

1308
01:16:52 --> 01:16:58
I'm not casting any doubt
on the particular theory,

1309
01:16:58 --> 01:17:00
that's a separate topic.
 

1310
01:17:00 --> 01:17:03
But you gotta realize that what
you're doing is taking an

1311
01:17:03 --> 01:17:07
essentially normal distribution
with the exception of some very

1312
01:17:07 --> 01:17:11
few -- there are a small
number of clear pathologies

1313
01:17:11 --> 01:17:12
of weight regulation.
 

1314
01:17:12 --> 01:17:15
Mostly what you're doing is
taking one tail of the

1315
01:17:15 --> 01:17:18
distribution, declaring it
to be abnormal, and putting

1316
01:17:18 --> 01:17:21
an explanation on it.
 

1317
01:17:21 --> 01:17:28
How you understand that
is culturally dependent.

1318
01:17:28 --> 01:17:31
How we talk about obesity
is in part defined by how

1319
01:17:31 --> 01:17:33
we talk about beauty.
 

1320
01:17:33 --> 01:17:38
In cultures where obesity is
considered beautiful, you don't

1321
01:17:38 --> 01:17:42
get theories that say it's
an abnormality, right?

1322
01:17:42 --> 01:17:47
So in some fashion we
do this all the time.

1323
01:17:47 --> 01:17:51
 
 

1324
01:17:51 --> 01:17:55
In the remaining time, what I
want to do, and then I'll loop

1325
01:17:55 --> 01:18:02
back to this point, is look on
your handout on page three.

1326
01:18:02 --> 01:18:07
Let's do a little bit of
armchair diagnosis here.

1327
01:18:07 --> 01:18:08
We don't have much time.
 

1328
01:18:08 --> 01:18:13
Quickly read these three
vignettes and quickly decide

1329
01:18:13 --> 01:18:18
where they lie on the scale
from fine to very weird.

1330
01:18:18 --> 01:18:22
I'm deliberately using very
casual language there in order

1331
01:18:22 --> 01:18:26
to suggest that you not think
deeply about whether or not

1332
01:18:26 --> 01:18:28
you're giving them a
psychiatric diagnosis

1333
01:18:28 --> 01:18:30
here, I just want to know
whether they're nuts.

1334
01:18:30 --> 01:18:36
 
 

1335
01:18:36 --> 01:18:37
We'll collect a little data.
 

1336
01:18:37 --> 01:18:39
How are we going to
collect this data?

1337
01:18:39 --> 01:19:04
 
 

1338
01:19:04 --> 01:19:07
Don't cheat off your neighbors,
please, and [? wavel ?]

1339
01:19:07 --> 01:19:08
in when you're done.
 

1340
01:19:08 --> 01:19:11
How many people are done?
 

1341
01:19:11 --> 01:19:11
Most people are done.
 

1342
01:19:11 --> 01:19:14
OK, good enough.
 

1343
01:19:14 --> 01:19:17
In the interest of getting some
data relatively quickly, let's

1344
01:19:17 --> 01:19:30
group between -- let's do
aluminum hat boy, Jim.

1345
01:19:30 --> 01:19:35
How many people gave him a
sort of 1-3, he's fine?

1346
01:19:35 --> 01:19:38
4-7 he's a little weird.
 

1347
01:19:38 --> 01:19:41
I take it we got a lot of
population-- All right.

1348
01:19:41 --> 01:19:45
 
 

1349
01:19:45 --> 01:19:46
So Jim's here.
 

1350
01:19:46 --> 01:19:49
 
 

1351
01:19:49 --> 01:19:52
How about Jack there at
the bottom -- we'll

1352
01:19:52 --> 01:19:53
come back to Sam.
 

1353
01:19:53 --> 01:19:55
How many people thought
Jack was in the 1-3

1354
01:19:55 --> 01:19:57
he's fine category?
 

1355
01:19:57 --> 01:20:00
 
 

1356
01:20:00 --> 01:20:00
A bunch of people.
 

1357
01:20:00 --> 01:20:04
How many people thought
he's in the 4-7 category?

1358
01:20:04 --> 01:20:06
A bunch more people.
 

1359
01:20:06 --> 01:20:08
Let's give him some hash
marks here so we can

1360
01:20:08 --> 01:20:11
tell the difference.
 

1361
01:20:11 --> 01:20:12
So this is -- what is his name?
 

1362
01:20:12 --> 01:20:13
Jack.
 

1363
01:20:13 --> 01:20:17
 
 

1364
01:20:17 --> 01:20:19
How many people thought
he was very weird?

1365
01:20:19 --> 01:20:21
So only a very few.
 

1366
01:20:21 --> 01:20:25
So, you can, in fact -- so Jim
is sort of the guy who came to

1367
01:20:25 --> 01:20:28
my lab all those years ago, and
Jack can be found in Harvard

1368
01:20:28 --> 01:20:32
Square any time selling some
far left newspaper and yelling

1369
01:20:32 --> 01:20:35
at you about the fact that
we're all controlled by

1370
01:20:35 --> 01:20:38
something, and we just consider
them to be sort of weird but

1371
01:20:38 --> 01:20:41
kind of -- this is in the
realm of free speech.

1372
01:20:41 --> 01:20:44
All right, let's
take a look at Sam.

1373
01:20:44 --> 01:20:49
How many people thought
Sam's just fine?

1374
01:20:49 --> 01:20:50
OK.
 

1375
01:20:50 --> 01:20:53
How many thought Sam was
just in the middle?

1376
01:20:53 --> 01:20:54
OK.
 

1377
01:20:54 --> 01:20:57
How many thought that
Sam was pretty weird?

1378
01:20:57 --> 01:21:02
All right, so that looks--
I need some space here.

1379
01:21:02 --> 01:21:10
 
 

1380
01:21:10 --> 01:21:13
Well actually, lots of fines,
a few less in the middles,

1381
01:21:13 --> 01:21:17
and almost as many weird.
 

1382
01:21:17 --> 01:21:19
Pretty wide
distribution, right.

1383
01:21:19 --> 01:21:22
The other two are
very heavily skewed.

1384
01:21:22 --> 01:21:26
Could somebody in
the fine department

1385
01:21:26 --> 01:21:29
explain why he's fine?
 

1386
01:21:29 --> 01:21:30
Yes, find person.
 

1387
01:21:30 --> 01:21:33
AUDIENCE: I think he's weird, I
just don't think he's disabled.

1388
01:21:33 --> 01:21:36
PROFESSOR: I need somebody
who thinks he's fine, fine.

1389
01:21:36 --> 01:21:38
Yes.
 

1390
01:21:38 --> 01:21:39
Yes, you pink person.
 

1391
01:21:39 --> 01:21:42
 
 

1392
01:21:42 --> 01:21:45
AUDIENCE: He's just a stamp
collector -- he sounds fine.

1393
01:21:45 --> 01:21:47
PROFESSOR: A stamp collector.
 

1394
01:21:47 --> 01:21:49
All right.
 

1395
01:21:49 --> 01:21:55
The trick here is there is a
two-word variation between what

1396
01:21:55 --> 01:21:58
half of you have and what
the other half of you have.

1397
01:21:58 --> 01:22:03
Let's see if that
makes a difference.

1398
01:22:03 --> 01:22:06
The people who don't have the
stamp collector one know the

1399
01:22:06 --> 01:22:13
difference, which is that one
half of you have his major

1400
01:22:13 --> 01:22:17
passion is collecting stamps,
and the other have his major

1401
01:22:17 --> 01:22:18
passion is collecting
women's undergarments.

1402
01:22:18 --> 01:22:22
 
 

1403
01:22:22 --> 01:22:24
Right.
 

1404
01:22:24 --> 01:22:26
That is the only
difference here.

1405
01:22:26 --> 01:22:27
Yes?
 

1406
01:22:27 --> 01:22:37
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
 

1407
01:22:37 --> 01:22:39
PROFESSOR: You know, actually
that's lovely because I

1408
01:22:39 --> 01:22:45
could probably expand
the description.

1409
01:22:45 --> 01:22:49
If I said he used to write all
of his relatives and asked them

1410
01:22:49 --> 01:22:54
to send him used stamps, nobody
would think that was weird.

1411
01:22:54 --> 01:22:57
If I said he used to write to
all his relatives and asked

1412
01:22:57 --> 01:23:02
them to send used underwear,
that's really weird, right?

1413
01:23:02 --> 01:23:05
 
 

1414
01:23:05 --> 01:23:09
If I changed it a little more
to say -- what is his name?

1415
01:23:09 --> 01:23:14
Sam was a shy, withdrawn man,
the president of the Haines

1416
01:23:14 --> 01:23:19
underwear company and at the
corporate headquarters he had

1417
01:23:19 --> 01:23:22
the big underwear exhibit
or something, then he

1418
01:23:22 --> 01:23:24
becomes less weird.
 

1419
01:23:24 --> 01:23:29
Given the time, let me just
reiterate the point that what

1420
01:23:29 --> 01:23:33
this is intended to illustrate
is that the border between what

1421
01:23:33 --> 01:23:38
makes you weird and what
makes you just a little

1422
01:23:38 --> 01:23:42
different is not clear.
 

1423
01:23:42 --> 01:23:44
It's not something that we
can define nice and sharply.

1424
01:23:44 --> 01:23:47
See you Thursday.
 

1425
01:23:47 --> 01:23:47
