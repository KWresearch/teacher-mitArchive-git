6
00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
PROFESSOR: The topic for
lecture for the next couple of

7
00:00:18 --> 00:00:25
days is going to be romantic
love or mating behavior or the

8
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
interaction thereof or
something like that.

9
00:00:28 --> 00:00:32
And I just learned the
Shakespeare Ensemble is

10
00:00:32 --> 00:00:36
doing Taming of the Shrew.
 

11
00:00:36 --> 00:00:37
When?
 

12
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
AUDIENCE: The nights of
Friday, Saturday and

13
00:00:40 --> 00:00:42
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]
 

14
00:00:42 --> 00:00:44
PROFESSOR: Tonight, tomorrow
night, and Saturday at?

15
00:00:44 --> 00:00:45
AUDIENCE: 8 o'clock.
 

16
00:00:45 --> 00:00:45
PROFESSOR: 8 o'clock.
 

17
00:00:45 --> 00:00:46
Where?
 

18
00:00:46 --> 00:00:47
AUDIENCE: Little
Kresge Theater.

19
00:00:47 --> 00:00:48
PROFESSOR: Little
Kresge Theater.

20
00:00:48 --> 00:00:51
We should probably assign
it like as homework or

21
00:00:51 --> 00:00:53
something like that.
 

22
00:00:53 --> 00:00:56
But you can go after
today's lecture.

23
00:00:56 --> 00:00:59
You can go and try to apply
evolutionary psychological

24
00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
theory to Taming of the
Shrew if you like.

25
00:01:02 --> 00:01:06
And you can tell Bianca
how you liked it.

26
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
All right, enough Shakespeare.
 

27
00:01:09 --> 00:01:12
Shakespeare shows up
again maybe later today.

28
00:01:12 --> 00:01:16
 
 

29
00:01:16 --> 00:01:16
Shhh.
 

30
00:01:16 --> 00:01:23
 
 

31
00:01:23 --> 00:01:26
Let me tell you about Chris
and Terry here who are

32
00:01:26 --> 00:01:28
having an argument.
 

33
00:01:28 --> 00:01:31
I realize this is sort of a
working memory exercise, too.

34
00:01:31 --> 00:01:35
So you have to pay attention to
the particular details here.

35
00:01:35 --> 00:01:39
So Chris and Terry are
having an argument.

36
00:01:39 --> 00:01:43
They've been going together
for about a year.

37
00:01:43 --> 00:01:47
They don't live together,
they do sleep together.

38
00:01:47 --> 00:01:52
Chris accuses Terry-- so Chris
accuses Terry-- of seeing

39
00:01:52 --> 00:01:54
someone else on the side.
 

40
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
Terry doesn't want
to talk about it.

41
00:01:56 --> 00:02:01
Chris says that Terry never
wants to talk about anything.

42
00:02:01 --> 00:02:06
Terry shouts that well, maybe
there is somebody else on the

43
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
side and says, well it's not
like there's been much

44
00:02:10 --> 00:02:13
activity in this
relationship lately anyway.

45
00:02:13 --> 00:02:20
And Chris snorts that there's
more to a relationship

46
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
than just sex.
 

47
00:02:22 --> 00:02:24
All right, you got that?
 

48
00:02:24 --> 00:02:29
And you will have noticed, even
Kristen-- who stayed up all

49
00:02:29 --> 00:02:33
night cheering the Red Sox--
will have noticed that Chris

50
00:02:33 --> 00:02:38
and Terry are deliberately
ambiguous as to the

51
00:02:38 --> 00:02:41
sex of who is who.
 

52
00:02:41 --> 00:02:44
They could of course
be the same sex.

53
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
And that reminds me to say
ahead a time, I'm going to talk

54
00:02:47 --> 00:02:51
almost exclusively for the next
two days, next two lectures

55
00:02:51 --> 00:02:55
about heterosexual
relationships.

56
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
Lots of fascinating stuff
to say about same sex

57
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
relationships, like so many
topics in introductory

58
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
psych, it's just one I'm
not going to get to.

59
00:03:04 --> 00:03:13
So if we assume that Chris and
Terry are male and female, one

60
00:03:13 --> 00:03:16
of them is male and one
of them is female.

61
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
And I don't remember which side
I was gestering too, so I don't

62
00:03:19 --> 00:03:20
remember-- was this
Chris or Terry?

63
00:03:20 --> 00:03:21
AUDIENCE: Terry.
 

64
00:03:21 --> 00:03:22
PROFESSOR: That was Terry.
 

65
00:03:22 --> 00:03:23
This was Chris.
 

66
00:03:23 --> 00:03:31
OK, so how many people vote
that Terry is the male person?

67
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
How many vote that Chris
is the male person?

68
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
How many vote that I got
lost in the details?

69
00:03:37 --> 00:03:38
I can't remember
who's who anymore?

70
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
All right, well quick review.
 

71
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
Chris accuses Terry of
seeing someone on the side.

72
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
Terry doesn't want
to talk about it.

73
00:03:45 --> 00:03:47
Chris says Terry
never wants to talk.

74
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
Terry shouts that there may be
somebody on the side and there

75
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
hasn't been much activity and
Chris says there's more to

76
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
a relationship than sex.
 

77
00:03:54 --> 00:03:56
How many vote Terry is male?
 

78
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
How many vote Chris is male?
 

79
00:03:59 --> 00:04:03
Gee, there seems to be a fairly
strong asymmetry there, which

80
00:04:03 --> 00:04:11
is capturing something of the
cliche that man are just

81
00:04:11 --> 00:04:15
interested in sex and women are
interested in commitment

82
00:04:15 --> 00:04:16
or something like that.
 

83
00:04:16 --> 00:04:22
This is sort of a cartoon
version recognizing that--

84
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
actually, we sort of backed off
what I was saying last time

85
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
about talking about individual
differences and now we're

86
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
talking about on average.
 

87
00:04:28 --> 00:04:34
Again, recognizing that
there's vast variations

88
00:04:34 --> 00:04:37
in relationships
between men and women.

89
00:04:37 --> 00:04:41
Is there any truth to
this sort of asymmetry?

90
00:04:41 --> 00:04:45
If there is, how in the
world would you explain it?

91
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
That's the job for
today's lecture.

92
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
Well, I mean, there's lots
of anecdotal evidence.

93
00:04:51 --> 00:04:57
How about a little bit of data
evidence from one of my

94
00:04:57 --> 00:05:03
favorite experiments in the
annals of experiments that you

95
00:05:03 --> 00:05:06
can't see how they ever got it
passed-- oh, does it say

96
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
IRB on the handout?
 

97
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
IRB stands for Institutional
Review Board.

98
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
You don't have to worry about
that bit of jargon, but those

99
00:05:13 --> 00:05:17
are the people who look at
experimental protocols

100
00:05:17 --> 00:05:21
and decide whether it's
permissible to do this.

101
00:05:21 --> 00:05:25
So if you volunteered to be a
subject in our lab-- please do,

102
00:05:25 --> 00:05:29
we need subjects, talk to
Kristen-- anyway, if you do

103
00:05:29 --> 00:05:35
we'll have you sign a 7 page
consent form because they're

104
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
really worried about the damage
we can do to you looking at

105
00:05:38 --> 00:05:41
little red and green bars
on a computer screen.

106
00:05:41 --> 00:05:46
So you have to imagine how this
experiment ever got passed the

107
00:05:46 --> 00:05:49
IRB, though it does seem like a
good one for reality

108
00:05:49 --> 00:05:50
TV perhaps.
 

109
00:05:50 --> 00:05:54
Anyway, so here you are, you're
wandering around on campus, and

110
00:05:54 --> 00:06:00
an attractive member of the
opposite sex approaches you

111
00:06:00 --> 00:06:03
and asks you one of
these 3 questions.

112
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
I should note that I was
explaining this to my wife this

113
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
morning and she got confused
and thought this was a

114
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
multiple choice test.
 

115
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
It's not a multiple
choice test, which

116
00:06:12 --> 00:06:16
would be even weirder.
 

117
00:06:16 --> 00:06:20
So the percentages don't
need to add up to 100.

118
00:06:20 --> 00:06:21
That's important.
 

119
00:06:21 --> 00:06:25
But this person comes up to you
and asks you either-- says

120
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
something to the effect of,
I've seen you around campus

121
00:06:28 --> 00:06:33
and you're really an
attractive person.

122
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
Would you go on a date with me?
 

123
00:06:35 --> 00:06:36
That's question 1.
 

124
00:06:36 --> 00:06:40
Would you come back to my
apartment with me or would

125
00:06:40 --> 00:06:41
you have sex with me?
 

126
00:06:41 --> 00:06:45
 
 

127
00:06:45 --> 00:06:51
What I can't find out is what
happens after the subject

128
00:06:51 --> 00:06:54
gives an answer, right?
 

129
00:06:54 --> 00:06:57
 
 

130
00:06:57 --> 00:07:00
This is a quite famous
experiment, but the original

131
00:07:00 --> 00:07:03
experiment is published in a
very obscure journal and I

132
00:07:03 --> 00:07:07
don't actually have a
copy of the article.

133
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
So we've got these 3 questions.
 

134
00:07:10 --> 00:07:14
There's the date question,
the apartment question,

135
00:07:14 --> 00:07:20
and the sex question.
 

136
00:07:20 --> 00:07:25
And so we'll plot
percent yes here.

137
00:07:25 --> 00:07:30
OK, if you are a woman person,
what do you think, what

138
00:07:30 --> 00:07:34
percentage of women said, yes,
I'll go on a date with

139
00:07:34 --> 00:07:35
you would you think?
 

140
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
AUDIENCE: 50%.
 

141
00:07:37 --> 00:07:38
PROFESSOR: What?
 

142
00:07:38 --> 00:07:39
PROFESSOR: 50%
 

143
00:07:39 --> 00:07:40
PROFESSOR: 50%.
 

144
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
That sounded terribly
authoritative.

145
00:07:42 --> 00:07:46
Is that because it's written
down in the book or something?

146
00:07:46 --> 00:07:47
AUDIENCE: I read it.
 

147
00:07:47 --> 00:07:49
PROFESSOR: You read it.
 

148
00:07:49 --> 00:07:50
It's not in [? Blightman ?]
 

149
00:07:50 --> 00:07:50
is it?
 

150
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
AUDIENCE: No, it's
on the website.

151
00:07:52 --> 00:07:53
PROFESSOR: It's on the website.
 

152
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
Oh, the articles
on the website?

153
00:07:55 --> 00:07:57
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
 

154
00:07:57 --> 00:07:57
PROFESSOR: Wait a second.
 

155
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
I thought I didn't find
the original article.

156
00:07:59 --> 00:08:00
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

157
00:08:00 --> 00:08:01
PROFESSOR: What?
 

158
00:08:01 --> 00:08:02
AUDIENCE: An article
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

159
00:08:02 --> 00:08:03
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.
 

160
00:08:03 --> 00:08:05
Well 50%.
 

161
00:08:05 --> 00:08:07
Thank you.
 

162
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
 
 

163
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
This-- whoops 50% doesn't
go all the way up.

164
00:08:12 --> 00:08:13
OK, 50%.
 

165
00:08:13 --> 00:08:17
This kind of takes the guess
work out of it a bit.

166
00:08:17 --> 00:08:20
AUDIENCE: I won't
answer anymore.

167
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
PROFESSOR: I thought we could
find out if you memorized

168
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
all the percentages.
 

169
00:08:24 --> 00:08:29
So all right, if you're not a
good person who went and read

170
00:08:29 --> 00:08:33
everything on the website-- all
right, how many women do you

171
00:08:33 --> 00:08:36
think were willing to go back
to the guy's apartment?

172
00:08:36 --> 00:08:38
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
 

173
00:08:38 --> 00:08:39
PROFESSOR: 2, 9 sounds great.
 

174
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
The average is about 6.
 

175
00:08:42 --> 00:08:45
So 50, 6.
 

176
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
Number or percentage of
women who said sure, I

177
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
will have sex with you?
 

178
00:08:50 --> 00:08:50
AUDIENCE: 1.
 

179
00:08:50 --> 00:08:52
AUDIENCE: Zero.
 

180
00:08:52 --> 00:08:54
PROFESSOR: Zero would
be a good, kshht.

181
00:08:54 --> 00:08:58
 
 

182
00:08:58 --> 00:09:05
Now the IRB or sort of the
sequel issue here that you'd

183
00:09:05 --> 00:09:08
love to know the answer to is,
how many times the guy got like

184
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
punched or reported to the
campus police or something.

185
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
But now, look.
 

186
00:09:13 --> 00:09:14
Do I have any color chalk?
 

187
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
No, we'll just have to go
for hatched bars today.

188
00:09:17 --> 00:09:18
So that's the female data.
 

189
00:09:18 --> 00:09:23
 
 

190
00:09:23 --> 00:09:25
Let's start at the
other end here.

191
00:09:25 --> 00:09:29
What percentage of guys
approached by a woman who said,

192
00:09:29 --> 00:09:30
I think you're attractive.
 

193
00:09:30 --> 00:09:33
Would you like to
have sex, said yes?

194
00:09:33 --> 00:09:35
AUDIENCE: 75.
 

195
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
PROFESSOR: She said she wasn't
going to be answering anymore.

196
00:09:38 --> 00:09:39
Yeah, OK.
 

197
00:09:39 --> 00:09:39
It's 75%.
 

198
00:09:39 --> 00:09:53
 
 

199
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
It's also interesting to
see what happens with the

200
00:09:56 --> 00:09:57
rest of the questions.
 

201
00:09:57 --> 00:10:02
If you ask, would you go back
to the apartment with me that

202
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
drops to about, I think, 67%.
 

203
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
 
 

204
00:10:07 --> 00:10:13
And if you ask, would you go on
a date with me it drops to 50.

205
00:10:13 --> 00:10:17
So, now look the world
is full of interesting

206
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
asymmetries in data.
 

207
00:10:20 --> 00:10:24
Even sex differences in say
mathematical ability or

208
00:10:24 --> 00:10:25
something like that.
 

209
00:10:25 --> 00:10:30
Sex differences in most
stuff look like this.

210
00:10:30 --> 00:10:34
There's a data point with an
error bar and there's another

211
00:10:34 --> 00:10:38
data point with an error bar
and you say, oh yeah, look.

212
00:10:38 --> 00:10:40
There's a significant sex
difference if we run

213
00:10:40 --> 00:10:43
8.5 million subjects.
 

214
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
You don't get data like
this most of the time.

215
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
This is like a huge asymmetry.
 

216
00:10:49 --> 00:10:53
So one interesting question
is, why is this huge?

217
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
And another interesting
question is this apparently

218
00:10:56 --> 00:11:01
counter intuitive slope to
the male data where you're

219
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
more likely if you're
a guy to say, oh sure.

220
00:11:03 --> 00:11:09
I'll have sex with you right
now, but I don't actually want

221
00:11:09 --> 00:11:11
to go on a date with you.
 

222
00:11:11 --> 00:11:15
Which is on the face of
it, perhaps a little odd.

223
00:11:15 --> 00:11:18
But we'll come back to
try to explain that.

224
00:11:18 --> 00:11:21
There are multiple ways.
 

225
00:11:21 --> 00:11:25
So this is not some weird
isolated data point where

226
00:11:25 --> 00:11:28
people just did a very odd--
it's an odd experiment.

227
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
Here, this is the one that you
really wonder about what the

228
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
next sentence was,
you know, hi.

229
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36
You're very attractive,
would you have sex with me?

230
00:11:36 --> 00:11:37
Oh yes, sure.
 

231
00:11:37 --> 00:11:39
Just kidding.
 

232
00:11:39 --> 00:11:44
 
 

233
00:11:44 --> 00:11:49
It's a very odd experiment,
but a very interesting one.

234
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
Yes, Mara knows the
answer to the rest of--

235
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
AUDIENCE: We have a question.
 

236
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
Did they control for
the attractiveness

237
00:11:55 --> 00:11:55
of the questioner?
 

238
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
I mean, what if--
 

239
00:11:57 --> 00:12:00
PROFESSOR: Well, the
description-- my expert witness

240
00:12:00 --> 00:12:02
can probably tell me better
because she's read this more

241
00:12:02 --> 00:12:05
recently apparently, the
description I think is simply

242
00:12:05 --> 00:12:08
that the experimenter -- this
experimenter's confederate is

243
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
described as being attractive.
 

244
00:12:10 --> 00:12:11
AUDIENCE: Well,
I'm just saying--

245
00:12:11 --> 00:12:12
pROFESSOR: But look.
 

246
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
Do the intuition.
 

247
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
You can only do the real
intuition for the sex that

248
00:12:16 --> 00:12:17
you happen to belong to.
 

249
00:12:17 --> 00:12:22
But ask yourself, really
attractive guy comes up and

250
00:12:22 --> 00:12:24
says, would you like to have
sex with me right now, do you

251
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
think the point moves
a lot off zero?

252
00:12:27 --> 00:12:37
And short of-- I don't know--
nonhuman woman, it's not clear

253
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
how much that point
moves either.

254
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
 
 

255
00:12:42 --> 00:12:43
I don't know.
 

256
00:12:43 --> 00:12:45
And it's not one
of these things.

257
00:12:45 --> 00:12:50
Also, by the way, I do not
recommend you know when you go

258
00:12:50 --> 00:12:53
off into-- course 15 seems to
be the place where they like to

259
00:12:53 --> 00:12:55
do survey experiments
and stuff like that.

260
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
I don't recommend this one as
one to try because I really do

261
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
think that it's hard to imagine
how to do this without

262
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
getting into serious trouble.
 

263
00:13:03 --> 00:13:05
Fascinating as the
experiment is.

264
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
Other efforts to get it the
same point have been done in

265
00:13:09 --> 00:13:12
sort of more indirect fashion,
so you can be your subject in

266
00:13:12 --> 00:13:17
this one, which was one where
you were asked to rate a

267
00:13:17 --> 00:13:24
variety of events as being
positive or negative--

268
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
effectively positive or
negative-- if this happened.

269
00:13:26 --> 00:13:31
And the most salient one seems
to me to be one where the

270
00:13:31 --> 00:13:36
description was you're on a
crowded subway car, an

271
00:13:36 --> 00:13:42
attractive member of the sex to
which you are attracted begins

272
00:13:42 --> 00:13:46
to surreptitiuosly touch
you on the subway car.

273
00:13:46 --> 00:13:50
Is this a positive or
a negative event?

274
00:13:50 --> 00:13:56
The answer in the data is women
overwhelmingly say eww, that's

275
00:13:56 --> 00:13:58
kind of creepy and negative.
 

276
00:13:58 --> 00:14:00
This is not good.
 

277
00:14:00 --> 00:14:05
And guys fairly
overwhelmingly say, yeah.

278
00:14:05 --> 00:14:09
What's the problem here?
 

279
00:14:09 --> 00:14:14
Again, you get a hugely
asymmetrical result and what

280
00:14:14 --> 00:14:18
we want to do is try to
account for that asymmetry.

281
00:14:18 --> 00:14:22
Now assuming that you have not
been entirely comatose for the

282
00:14:22 --> 00:14:25
first half of the course you
will recognize that the broad

283
00:14:25 --> 00:14:31
classes of explanation are
going to be nature nurture

284
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
kinds of things and of course,
it's always a combination.

285
00:14:34 --> 00:14:39
In particular, today what I'm
going to talk about is a

286
00:14:39 --> 00:14:43
biological account and that's
the account coming out of

287
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
evolutionary psychology.
 

288
00:14:45 --> 00:14:48
Evolutionary psychology, the
application of evolutionary

289
00:14:48 --> 00:14:54
theory to the topics in
psychology is very prevalent,

290
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
very important these days.
 

291
00:14:56 --> 00:15:01
It gets applied to a huge range
of topics, some of which it

292
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
probably doesn't have
much to say about.

293
00:15:04 --> 00:15:07
But if there's anything that
it's got a lot to say about

294
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
it's probably human
mating behavior.

295
00:15:10 --> 00:15:12
 
 

296
00:15:12 --> 00:15:15
And so that's why I'll talk
about evolutionary psychology

297
00:15:15 --> 00:15:18
in this particular context.
 

298
00:15:18 --> 00:15:20
This is not to say it's the
only way of accounting for

299
00:15:20 --> 00:15:23
mating behavior, but it's a
particularly-- I think, it's

300
00:15:23 --> 00:15:27
very hard to argue that these
sort of biological forces don't

301
00:15:27 --> 00:15:33
have some shaping influence on
the way that we select mates

302
00:15:33 --> 00:15:36
and I want to try cashing
out that argument today.

303
00:15:36 --> 00:15:43
If you want to read more about
it there are several-- I

304
00:15:43 --> 00:15:47
put reference to several
books on the handout.

305
00:15:47 --> 00:15:51
All of which I put on there
because they talk about the

306
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
topic, but they're
all good reads.

307
00:15:53 --> 00:15:56
My current favorite actually
is the [? Bowmeister ?]

308
00:15:56 --> 00:15:57
and [? Tyce ?]
 

309
00:15:57 --> 00:15:57
one.
 

310
00:15:57 --> 00:16:00
It's less of one of the ones
that's sort of been on the

311
00:16:00 --> 00:16:03
bestseller list, but it's a
beautifully written

312
00:16:03 --> 00:16:09
book on this topic if
you're interested.

313
00:16:09 --> 00:16:13
All right, so let's run down
the basic evolutionary psych

314
00:16:13 --> 00:16:18
argument and then attempts to
see how it might account for

315
00:16:18 --> 00:16:23
the sort of data that
we see in this area.

316
00:16:23 --> 00:16:29
If you are operating within
this sort of evolutionary

317
00:16:29 --> 00:16:32
framework your goal as an
organism is to do what?

318
00:16:32 --> 00:16:34
AUDIENCE: Pass on the genes.
 

319
00:16:34 --> 00:16:35
PROFESSOR: Pass on your genes.
 

320
00:16:35 --> 00:16:37
You've got to propagate your
genes in some fashion.

321
00:16:37 --> 00:16:40
 
 

322
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
You want to get that
genetic material into

323
00:16:43 --> 00:16:45
future generations.
 

324
00:16:45 --> 00:16:46
And how you going to do that?
 

325
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
 
 

326
00:16:49 --> 00:16:53
Weren't you paying
attention in high school?

327
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56
There are several ways, but
sexual reproduction is

328
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
considered perhaps the
most direct of these.

329
00:16:59 --> 00:17:01
It's not the only
one, by the way.

330
00:17:01 --> 00:17:08
It's important to point out
that if you think that again,

331
00:17:08 --> 00:17:10
by the way, all of this stuff
is presumably operating

332
00:17:10 --> 00:17:13
at a very unconscious
implicit kind of level.

333
00:17:13 --> 00:17:19
Nobody assums that people are
wandering around the dating

334
00:17:19 --> 00:17:21
scene saying, got to
pass on my genes.

335
00:17:21 --> 00:17:23
How am I going to do that?
 

336
00:17:23 --> 00:17:30
But the forces, the forces that
are shaping that behavior are

337
00:17:30 --> 00:17:37
within this viewpoint shaped by
this drive to pass on genetic

338
00:17:37 --> 00:17:39
material into the
next generation.

339
00:17:39 --> 00:17:42
You can also propagate
your genes by taking

340
00:17:42 --> 00:17:46
care of your relations.
 

341
00:17:46 --> 00:17:53
So if you've got a brother or
sister with kids, those kids

342
00:17:53 --> 00:17:57
are genetically related to you
and if you nurture them, if you

343
00:17:57 --> 00:18:00
pay for their college education
or something, they're not as

344
00:18:00 --> 00:18:02
genetically related to you as
your own children, but they're

345
00:18:02 --> 00:18:04
genetically related to you.
 

346
00:18:04 --> 00:18:07
And so you can do the
propagation thing indirectly

347
00:18:07 --> 00:18:11
rather than through just
regular old-fashioned

348
00:18:11 --> 00:18:13
sexual reproduction.
 

349
00:18:13 --> 00:18:17
This, by the way, is one of the
arguments offered by

350
00:18:17 --> 00:18:22
evolutionary psychologists for
the persistence of same

351
00:18:22 --> 00:18:24
sex relationships.
 

352
00:18:24 --> 00:18:28
Same sex relationships are a
problem from this evolutionary

353
00:18:28 --> 00:18:32
point of view because they
don't lead to offspring, right?

354
00:18:32 --> 00:18:37
Whatever else is going on,
they don't lead to offspring.

355
00:18:37 --> 00:18:40
I don't know if there's any
data for it, perhaps because I

356
00:18:40 --> 00:18:45
haven't looked, but one of the
arguments that has been put

357
00:18:45 --> 00:18:49
forward from time to time are
things like oh, gay men

358
00:18:49 --> 00:18:52
make great uncles.
 

359
00:18:52 --> 00:18:54
They're not going to have kids
of their own, but they take

360
00:18:54 --> 00:18:59
care of their sister's kids and
that's why it's not selected

361
00:18:59 --> 00:19:05
out-- it's not selected
against by evolution.

362
00:19:05 --> 00:19:11
In any case, sticking with this
sort of mainline tail, you

363
00:19:11 --> 00:19:13
want to propagate your genes.
 

364
00:19:13 --> 00:19:17
Sexual reproduction is
a good way to do it.

365
00:19:17 --> 00:19:22
Now the thing about sex
is you get pregnant.

366
00:19:22 --> 00:19:26
Actually only 1/2 of
you get pregnant.

367
00:19:26 --> 00:19:28
It was sort of an
ambiguous sentence.

368
00:19:28 --> 00:19:31
This is 1/2 of you,
plural, get pregnant.

369
00:19:31 --> 00:19:36
Not 1/2 of you as an
individual get pregnant.

370
00:19:36 --> 00:19:39
You never know what people
learn in high school.

371
00:19:39 --> 00:19:46
In any case, it is that fact,
that's the key fact this story

372
00:19:46 --> 00:19:48
that produces the asymmetry.
 

373
00:19:48 --> 00:19:51
Women get pregnant, men
don't get pregnant.

374
00:19:51 --> 00:19:52
Why is that important?
 

375
00:19:52 --> 00:19:58
Well, that's important because
being pregnant ties you up for

376
00:19:58 --> 00:20:05
9 months, being pregnant for 9
months at a time greatly is a

377
00:20:05 --> 00:20:10
profound rate-limiting step on
how many kids you can have.

378
00:20:10 --> 00:20:17
And then if you're a human
and not a spider or

379
00:20:17 --> 00:20:18
something like that.
 

380
00:20:18 --> 00:20:22
Once the kid is born or
hatched or whatever you

381
00:20:22 --> 00:20:23
still got a problem here.
 

382
00:20:23 --> 00:20:26
You want this little bundle of
genes to do something for you

383
00:20:26 --> 00:20:28
in evolutionary terms, you
got to keep it alive.

384
00:20:28 --> 00:20:30
So it's not just the 9 months.
 

385
00:20:30 --> 00:20:35
There's a long time, long term
commitment to this little

386
00:20:35 --> 00:20:38
evolutionary project that
you've gotten into.

387
00:20:38 --> 00:20:42
The same constraints do not
necessarily apply to men.

388
00:20:42 --> 00:20:45
Certainly the rate-limiting
step does not apply because in

389
00:20:45 --> 00:20:49
principle guys can go off and
have a gazillion babies--

390
00:20:49 --> 00:20:53
that's a technical term-- as
long as they can find the

391
00:20:53 --> 00:20:55
requisite gazillion women.
 

392
00:20:55 --> 00:20:59
The rate-limiting step for man
is just how many women can

393
00:20:59 --> 00:21:01
you successfully impregnate?
 

394
00:21:01 --> 00:21:03
 
 

395
00:21:03 --> 00:21:08
We're not talking in what is
right in social, civilized

396
00:21:08 --> 00:21:10
world or something
like that, right?

397
00:21:10 --> 00:21:11
But we're just talking
about the biology of

398
00:21:11 --> 00:21:13
the situation here.
 

399
00:21:13 --> 00:21:16
The men don't get pregnant.
 

400
00:21:16 --> 00:21:20
If you get woman 1 pregnant
today you can get woman 2

401
00:21:20 --> 00:21:22
pregnant tomorrow in principle.
 

402
00:21:22 --> 00:21:23
That's not true for the woman.
 

403
00:21:23 --> 00:21:26
If you are a woman and you get
pregnant today you don't get to

404
00:21:26 --> 00:21:29
get pregnant again tomorrow.
 

405
00:21:29 --> 00:21:30
That doesn't work.
 

406
00:21:30 --> 00:21:35
So fundamental difference, the
evolutionary psych argument is

407
00:21:35 --> 00:21:37
that this should produce
fundamental differences

408
00:21:37 --> 00:21:38
in behavior.
 

409
00:21:38 --> 00:21:42
In particular, if your goal is
to get as many successful

410
00:21:42 --> 00:21:46
bundles of genes into the next
generation as possible guys

411
00:21:46 --> 00:21:49
should be inclined to have sex
early and often with as many

412
00:21:49 --> 00:21:52
partners as possible because
that's going to produce

413
00:21:52 --> 00:21:53
lots and lots of babies.
 

414
00:21:53 --> 00:21:57
Women should be looking for
something more like a

415
00:21:57 --> 00:22:03
commitment because it's a lot
easier to take care of this

416
00:22:03 --> 00:22:06
little bundle of joy if
somebody else's helping out.

417
00:22:06 --> 00:22:10
Either helping take care of the
kid or at the very least,

418
00:22:10 --> 00:22:13
providing resources for this.
 

419
00:22:13 --> 00:22:16
It's an expensive business
raising a kid, not just an

420
00:22:16 --> 00:22:19
expensive business if your a
nice middle class kid and

421
00:22:19 --> 00:22:22
you're expecting to go to
MIT or something like that.

422
00:22:22 --> 00:22:23
It's an expensive
business period.

423
00:22:23 --> 00:22:26
You gotta feed the kid, you
gotta keep it warm, and so on.

424
00:22:26 --> 00:22:28
Resources are required.
 

425
00:22:28 --> 00:22:37
And it is in your interest as
the woman to have guys around,

426
00:22:37 --> 00:22:41
at least a guy around who's
going to provide resources.

427
00:22:41 --> 00:22:43
Now, you can make
up other stories.

428
00:22:43 --> 00:22:47
You could make up a story that
says it would be in the woman's

429
00:22:47 --> 00:22:51
interest to have multiple mates
who are kept in some doubts

430
00:22:51 --> 00:22:58
about who the father is so that
they all provide resource.

431
00:22:58 --> 00:23:01
That sounds funny, but there's
no reason why that story and

432
00:23:01 --> 00:23:05
there are species where that
seems to-- you can almost

433
00:23:05 --> 00:23:07
always find an animal
where it works out.

434
00:23:07 --> 00:23:13
If humans were a polyandrous
species, a species where

435
00:23:13 --> 00:23:19
females had multiple mates at
the same time that would

436
00:23:19 --> 00:23:22
require explanation and you
could try explaining

437
00:23:22 --> 00:23:23
it the same terms.
 

438
00:23:23 --> 00:23:31
As it turns out across cultures
the pattern is either one male,

439
00:23:31 --> 00:23:35
one female or one male,
several females.

440
00:23:35 --> 00:23:41
That there are much rarer
instances of one female, many

441
00:23:41 --> 00:23:45
males in human populations.
 

442
00:23:45 --> 00:23:52
So the mainline story is that
the constraints of biology are

443
00:23:52 --> 00:23:57
going to incline the population
to a population of males who

444
00:23:57 --> 00:24:05
are interested in frequent
sex and whenever.

445
00:24:05 --> 00:24:10
And women who are going to be
looking for a mate who's

446
00:24:10 --> 00:24:12
willing to make some
sort of commitment.

447
00:24:12 --> 00:24:18
Now is there any evidence for
evolutionary forces, biological

448
00:24:18 --> 00:24:22
constraints on mate
selection in humans?

449
00:24:22 --> 00:24:25
Quite apart from these
questions about who

450
00:24:25 --> 00:24:26
wants sex and when.
 

451
00:24:26 --> 00:24:30
Is there any evidence
for this at all?

452
00:24:30 --> 00:24:33
The answer is yes.
 

453
00:24:33 --> 00:24:37
If I give some examples it's
sort of surprising that this

454
00:24:37 --> 00:24:41
was ever controversial.
 

455
00:24:41 --> 00:24:42
Well, let's give an example.
 

456
00:24:42 --> 00:24:46
For example, if you're looking
for evidence that something has

457
00:24:46 --> 00:24:49
these sort of biological,
evolutionary roots what you're

458
00:24:49 --> 00:24:53
looking for is something that
is ubiquitous in

459
00:24:53 --> 00:24:55
human societies.
 

460
00:24:55 --> 00:25:02
You don't want something where
it's deemed attractive in one

461
00:25:02 --> 00:25:05
population or desirable in one
population and not in

462
00:25:05 --> 00:25:05
another population.
 

463
00:25:05 --> 00:25:08
That can be very
culturally determined.

464
00:25:08 --> 00:25:12
So I don't know of much in the
way of great evolutionary psych

465
00:25:12 --> 00:25:14
arguments in favor of
which bits of your body

466
00:25:14 --> 00:25:17
should be pierced.
 

467
00:25:17 --> 00:25:20
That seems to be the sort of
thing that some groups think

468
00:25:20 --> 00:25:23
this is attractive and some
groups think that is attractive

469
00:25:23 --> 00:25:28
and yeah-- but across human
cultures there is a consistent

470
00:25:28 --> 00:25:34
preference for mates who are
young and healthy as opposed to

471
00:25:34 --> 00:25:36
mates who are old and sick.
 

472
00:25:36 --> 00:25:44
There is no place where the
ideal of attractiveness is an

473
00:25:44 --> 00:25:46
old person with a disease.
 

474
00:25:46 --> 00:25:48
It just isn't the case.
 

475
00:25:48 --> 00:25:56
Now it almost sounds funny,
but-- I got a house

476
00:25:56 --> 00:25:56
full of books.
 

477
00:25:56 --> 00:25:58
I like to collect books.
 

478
00:25:58 --> 00:26:02
It turns out that the books I
like best are pretty old and

479
00:26:02 --> 00:26:06
diseased and that's not weird.
 

480
00:26:06 --> 00:26:09
That doesn't strike
people as odd.

481
00:26:09 --> 00:26:12
You do need to explain, it
doesn't take much work to

482
00:26:12 --> 00:26:15
explain why there's a
preference for young, healthy

483
00:26:15 --> 00:26:17
mates over old diseased mates.
 

484
00:26:17 --> 00:26:19
If you think that this has
something to do with a drive

485
00:26:19 --> 00:26:22
towards reproduction you're
much more likely to reproduce

486
00:26:22 --> 00:26:24
successfully with a
young, healthy make.

487
00:26:24 --> 00:26:27
 
 

488
00:26:27 --> 00:26:34
The reason that these topics
have been controversial has

489
00:26:34 --> 00:26:37
less to do with the science of
the situation or it has had

490
00:26:37 --> 00:26:40
less to do with the science of
the situation than with the

491
00:26:40 --> 00:26:41
politics of the situation.
 

492
00:26:41 --> 00:26:48
It is possible, as in the IQ
case to go from uncontroversial

493
00:26:48 --> 00:26:55
or fairly straightforward bits
of science to undesirable or at

494
00:26:55 --> 00:26:59
least controversial conclusions
in a more political realm.

495
00:26:59 --> 00:27:05
So the sorts of things if you
agree, if you are forced by the

496
00:27:05 --> 00:27:09
data to say look, there's a
whopping asymmetry between

497
00:27:09 --> 00:27:13
males and females in this area.
 

498
00:27:13 --> 00:27:18
It is perhaps-- the concern
is-- that it's a slippery slope

499
00:27:18 --> 00:27:24
from here to saying well, it's
OK to pay women less than men.

500
00:27:24 --> 00:27:27
The actual causal chain between
this particular factoid in

501
00:27:27 --> 00:27:30
paying women less than men is
not immediately obvious to me

502
00:27:30 --> 00:27:31
as I'm saying it right here.
 

503
00:27:31 --> 00:27:37
But the reason that this is
politically controversial is

504
00:27:37 --> 00:27:41
because anything that
acknowledges a difference, some

505
00:27:41 --> 00:27:45
sort of biological difference
between say men and women can

506
00:27:45 --> 00:27:50
in principle be used as a
defense for social inequalities

507
00:27:50 --> 00:27:54
that you may not
find desirable.

508
00:27:54 --> 00:27:57
But that's really a
separate question.

509
00:27:57 --> 00:28:00
The scientific question or the
psychological question is

510
00:28:00 --> 00:28:00
are there differences?
 

511
00:28:00 --> 00:28:05
There certainly seem to
be data differences and

512
00:28:05 --> 00:28:07
where did they come from?
 

513
00:28:07 --> 00:28:10
 
 

514
00:28:10 --> 00:28:13
There are other sort of
universal preferences that seem

515
00:28:13 --> 00:28:22
to reflect this desire for a
mate who is likely to be a good

516
00:28:22 --> 00:28:26
partner in reproduction.
 

517
00:28:26 --> 00:28:29
What is it that makes
a face attractive?

518
00:28:29 --> 00:28:35
Well, one of the things that is
attractive is facial symmetry.

519
00:28:35 --> 00:28:42
That all else being equal it's
considered to be better--

520
00:28:42 --> 00:28:44
you're consider to be more
attractive-- a face is rated as

521
00:28:44 --> 00:28:46
more attractive if it's
symmetrical than if

522
00:28:46 --> 00:28:47
it's asymmetrical.
 

523
00:28:47 --> 00:28:49
Why is that?
 

524
00:28:49 --> 00:28:53
Most of the things that are
likely to produce noticeable

525
00:28:53 --> 00:29:02
asymmetries in the face are
things that suggest either a

526
00:29:02 --> 00:29:06
genetic deformity of some
sort or an accident.

527
00:29:06 --> 00:29:10
 
 

528
00:29:10 --> 00:29:12
Neither of them are going
to be great advertisements

529
00:29:12 --> 00:29:16
for reproductive success.
 

530
00:29:16 --> 00:29:21
Imagine somebody with half a
face, you know intuitively that

531
00:29:21 --> 00:29:24
either you're watching a sci-fi
movie or there's something

532
00:29:24 --> 00:29:27
fundamentally wrong here.
 

533
00:29:27 --> 00:29:31
Oh, what is an attractive face
in general is an interesting--

534
00:29:31 --> 00:29:33
I didn't put all those
references on the handout.

535
00:29:33 --> 00:29:35
There's an interesting
literature on what makes an

536
00:29:35 --> 00:29:40
attractive face that is
worth a little side note.

537
00:29:40 --> 00:29:49
 
 

538
00:29:49 --> 00:29:50
You could have two theories.
 

539
00:29:50 --> 00:29:53
One theory would be attractive
is one end of a scale that

540
00:29:53 --> 00:29:56
runs from ugly to gorgeous.
 

541
00:29:56 --> 00:29:59
That all those hollywood actors
and actresses are pegged out

542
00:29:59 --> 00:30:01
here on the gorgeous
end of some scale.

543
00:30:01 --> 00:30:04
 
 

544
00:30:04 --> 00:30:12
The alternative theory is that
it is average faces-- that an

545
00:30:12 --> 00:30:16
average face is what's normal,
is what's deemed attractive.

546
00:30:16 --> 00:30:19
 
 

547
00:30:19 --> 00:30:21
The original evidence for this
comes from a photographic

548
00:30:21 --> 00:30:24
technique where what you did
was you took a whole bunch of

549
00:30:24 --> 00:30:29
photographs and superimposed
them to make a composite face

550
00:30:29 --> 00:30:31
and you found that those were
rated as more attractive than

551
00:30:31 --> 00:30:35
individual faces as a whole.
 

552
00:30:35 --> 00:30:39
And this was being done by
clever techniques back--

553
00:30:39 --> 00:30:43
oh, I think in early part
of the 20th century.

554
00:30:43 --> 00:30:46
And it's gotten a lot easier
now that we've got computers

555
00:30:46 --> 00:30:48
to do these sort of things.
 

556
00:30:48 --> 00:30:52
The difficulty, one of the
things that made this research

557
00:30:52 --> 00:30:55
a little tricky is that one
thing that averaging faces

558
00:30:55 --> 00:30:58
does is it does wonders
for your complexion.

559
00:30:58 --> 00:31:03
 
 

560
00:31:03 --> 00:31:06
Everybody's nose is in more
or less the same place, but

561
00:31:06 --> 00:31:07
everybody's zit is not.
 

562
00:31:07 --> 00:31:11
And so if you average 100 faces
you get people with gorgeous

563
00:31:11 --> 00:31:14
complexions and there's some
part of that effect that just

564
00:31:14 --> 00:31:17
comes from the fact that
they look like they had

565
00:31:17 --> 00:31:19
really healthy skin.
 

566
00:31:19 --> 00:31:22
It's a debate that jumps back
and forth, if you turn out to

567
00:31:22 --> 00:31:25
be deeply interested in what
makes a face attractive send

568
00:31:25 --> 00:31:27
me a note, I'll send you the
reference since I see I didn't

569
00:31:27 --> 00:31:30
put them on the handout.
 

570
00:31:30 --> 00:31:33
We can ask for a couple of
other things that suggests

571
00:31:33 --> 00:31:36
these universals across
human populations.

572
00:31:36 --> 00:31:43
 
 

573
00:31:43 --> 00:31:45
What's more desirable
in a mate?

574
00:31:45 --> 00:31:48
Richer or poorer?
 

575
00:31:48 --> 00:31:49
AUDIENCE: Richer.
 

576
00:31:49 --> 00:31:52
PROFESSOR: Richer,
that's easy enough.

577
00:31:52 --> 00:31:56
Is that preference the
same for men and women?

578
00:31:56 --> 00:31:59
Who's more interested in
finding-- I'll tell you the

579
00:31:59 --> 00:32:03
answer-- it's not the same,
how many vote that it's men

580
00:32:03 --> 00:32:06
who are more interested in
finding a wealthy mate?

581
00:32:06 --> 00:32:08
How many vote that it's women?
 

582
00:32:08 --> 00:32:13
You got the right intuition and
the evolutionary psych story

583
00:32:13 --> 00:32:15
there is the resource story.
 

584
00:32:15 --> 00:32:22
That what you're looking for
is evidence of resource.

585
00:32:22 --> 00:32:27
Is this guy going to help me
feed all those hundreds of

586
00:32:27 --> 00:32:31
babies that he thinks
we're going to have?

587
00:32:31 --> 00:32:39
And this is also presumed to
be-- why is it that driving,

588
00:32:39 --> 00:32:43
cruising around town in the
fancy car, you know

589
00:32:43 --> 00:32:44
what's that about?
 

590
00:32:44 --> 00:32:47
That's a peacock tail effect.
 

591
00:32:47 --> 00:32:50
I think I already described
the peacock tail effect

592
00:32:50 --> 00:32:51
earlier in the course.
 

593
00:32:51 --> 00:32:56
The idea is I'm showing off my
resources, I've got so much

594
00:32:56 --> 00:32:58
money that I can buy
this stupid car.

595
00:32:58 --> 00:33:05
My hubcaps cost more than
your house, which is why

596
00:33:05 --> 00:33:08
you want to mate with me.
 

597
00:33:08 --> 00:33:11
This is presumed to be the
way that they-- OK, how

598
00:33:11 --> 00:33:14
about age of spouse?
 

599
00:33:14 --> 00:33:17
Or age of mate?
 

600
00:33:17 --> 00:33:23
On average, if you are a male,
you want a-- and this is very

601
00:33:23 --> 00:33:27
importantly on average, because
it's not to say, well, let's

602
00:33:27 --> 00:33:29
get the data point first.
 

603
00:33:29 --> 00:33:33
If you're a male, on average
how many people vote that you

604
00:33:33 --> 00:33:37
were looking for a mate who
is-- well, this is a 3

605
00:33:37 --> 00:33:39
alternative forced choice, you
got to vote for one of them:

606
00:33:39 --> 00:33:41
little older, exactly the
same age, little younger.

607
00:33:41 --> 00:33:44
How many vote for little older?
 

608
00:33:44 --> 00:33:47
How many vote for
just the same age?

609
00:33:47 --> 00:33:50
How many vote for
a little younger?

610
00:33:50 --> 00:33:54
OK, got that intuition right.
 

611
00:33:54 --> 00:34:00
So males on average, in culture
after culture seek mates

612
00:34:00 --> 00:34:01
who are a little younger.
 

613
00:34:01 --> 00:34:03
The amount varies culturally.
 

614
00:34:03 --> 00:34:06
In some cultures it's
significantly younger.

615
00:34:06 --> 00:34:10
In some cultures it only a
couple of years, but it is

616
00:34:10 --> 00:34:15
across cultures younger.
 

617
00:34:15 --> 00:34:18
OK, so the point I was going to
make before is you're sitting

618
00:34:18 --> 00:34:25
there saying, my girlfriend is
like 2 years older than me.

619
00:34:25 --> 00:34:28
This does not mean that you are
some sort of genetic misfit.

620
00:34:28 --> 00:34:33
It means that we're back to
talking about the mean value

621
00:34:33 --> 00:34:39
and all of these things have
a distribution around them.

622
00:34:39 --> 00:34:46
It would be considered odd if
your choice in mates was, I

623
00:34:46 --> 00:34:50
only date women who are
60 years older than me.

624
00:34:50 --> 00:34:54
That would be considered
unusual, but that should be

625
00:34:54 --> 00:34:56
way, way out on one tail of it.
 

626
00:34:56 --> 00:34:59
But typically, the mean of
that distribution lies

627
00:34:59 --> 00:35:00
a little younger.
 

628
00:35:00 --> 00:35:03
OK, why is that the case?
 

629
00:35:03 --> 00:35:05
If you're following this
evolutionary psych story, why

630
00:35:05 --> 00:35:10
do males seek females who
are slightly younger?

631
00:35:10 --> 00:35:11
AUDIENCE: They can
have more babies.

632
00:35:11 --> 00:35:15
PROFESSOR: More babies, right.
 

633
00:35:15 --> 00:35:18
The males may not be limited
in principle by the same

634
00:35:18 --> 00:35:20
rate-limiting step, but if
you're in a culture that's

635
00:35:20 --> 00:35:25
going to limit you to 1 woman
you better get 1 woman

636
00:35:25 --> 00:35:29
who's going to produced the
maximum number of babies.

637
00:35:29 --> 00:35:32
So you better start young.
 

638
00:35:32 --> 00:35:37
So, if you are a woman,
same multiple choice.

639
00:35:37 --> 00:35:41
If you are a women, the
average-- across cultures women

640
00:35:41 --> 00:35:44
prefer-- how many vote that
women prefer males who

641
00:35:44 --> 00:35:46
are slightly older?
 

642
00:35:46 --> 00:35:49
Exactly the same age?
 

643
00:35:49 --> 00:35:51
Slightly younger?
 

644
00:35:51 --> 00:35:52
You got the right intuition.
 

645
00:35:52 --> 00:35:54
Again, it's very convenient
that this is the

646
00:35:54 --> 00:35:54
way it works out.
 

647
00:35:54 --> 00:36:00
It's really bad news if
everybody wants younger mates.

648
00:36:00 --> 00:36:02
That doesn't work well.
 

649
00:36:02 --> 00:36:06
But actually, we'll come back
to that in the next lecture.

650
00:36:06 --> 00:36:10
I'll just put that out there
as a problem to solve.

651
00:36:10 --> 00:36:17
Everybody does want to max
out on the attractive, rich

652
00:36:17 --> 00:36:22
gorgeous thing, but most of
us aren't going to get that.

653
00:36:22 --> 00:36:24
 
 

654
00:36:24 --> 00:36:28
It's one male to one
female roughly speaking.

655
00:36:28 --> 00:36:32
We can't all have that
person, it just isn't

656
00:36:32 --> 00:36:33
going to work well.
 

657
00:36:33 --> 00:36:36
So we'll have to solve
that next week.

658
00:36:36 --> 00:36:41
OK, why do females want males
who are slightly older?

659
00:36:41 --> 00:36:43
AUDIENCE: Maturity.
 

660
00:36:43 --> 00:36:44
PROFESSOR: Maturity--
good luck.

661
00:36:44 --> 00:36:51
 
 

662
00:36:51 --> 00:36:56
The evolutionary psych argument
is the resource argument.

663
00:36:56 --> 00:36:59
I'm sure maturity doesn't
hurt either, but it's

664
00:36:59 --> 00:37:01
the resource argument.
 

665
00:37:01 --> 00:37:05
A guy has had a chance to
accumulate more resource

666
00:37:05 --> 00:37:08
if he's a little older.
 

667
00:37:08 --> 00:37:11
And so you've got these
endless-- sometimes, literally

668
00:37:11 --> 00:37:16
endless-- big, thick 19th
century romance novels that you

669
00:37:16 --> 00:37:21
read in English lit at some
point where he loves her but

670
00:37:21 --> 00:37:24
they can't get together for 800
pages because he's got to go

671
00:37:24 --> 00:37:27
out and collect resource in
some fashion until he can come

672
00:37:27 --> 00:37:35
back and show daddy that he
can support the daughter.

673
00:37:35 --> 00:37:37
The alternative version of the
19th century romance is the

674
00:37:37 --> 00:37:43
interview where daddy asks, how
much money your daddy left you.

675
00:37:43 --> 00:37:47
Oh, yes, I have a
thousand pounds.

676
00:37:47 --> 00:37:49
They're all English novels.
 

677
00:37:49 --> 00:37:52
A thousand pounds a year in the
funds or something like that.

678
00:37:52 --> 00:37:53
That's resource, that's good.
 

679
00:37:53 --> 00:37:56
 
 

680
00:37:56 --> 00:37:58
Oh, there's one exception.
 

681
00:37:58 --> 00:38:05
There is a population of males
who seeks slightly older women.

682
00:38:05 --> 00:38:07
Who is that population?
 

683
00:38:07 --> 00:38:08
[?___AUDIENCE:__
_Teenagers.___?]

684
00:38:08 --> 00:38:12
PROFESSOR: Exactly.
 

685
00:38:12 --> 00:38:16
There's this cruel sick chortle
that we just got from-- all

686
00:38:16 --> 00:38:18
the answers given to
that were by women.

687
00:38:18 --> 00:38:24
All of whom were snickering
about it, which is harsh.

688
00:38:24 --> 00:38:27
But it's teenage males,
particularly young teenage

689
00:38:27 --> 00:38:33
males who develop crushes
on slightly older or maybe

690
00:38:33 --> 00:38:35
quite a bit older women.
 

691
00:38:35 --> 00:38:36
Why?
 

692
00:38:36 --> 00:38:38
What's that about?
 

693
00:38:38 --> 00:38:39
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

694
00:38:39 --> 00:38:40
AUDIENCE: They're fertile.
 

695
00:38:40 --> 00:38:42
PROFESSOR: They're
fertile, exactly.

696
00:38:42 --> 00:38:47
Now, I mean, the kid
doesn't know this.

697
00:38:47 --> 00:38:49
Oh, I think I'd better fall
in love with somebody

698
00:38:49 --> 00:38:50
who's fertile.
 

699
00:38:50 --> 00:38:53
 
 

700
00:38:53 --> 00:38:55
That's presumably not what's
operating at any sort of

701
00:38:55 --> 00:39:02
conscious level here, but if
evolutionary forces drive you

702
00:39:02 --> 00:39:08
to look for a mate who's going
to be fertile and you're an

703
00:39:08 --> 00:39:13
early adolescent male,
9-year-old girls are not

704
00:39:13 --> 00:39:16
the population of choice.
 

705
00:39:16 --> 00:39:22
And you may notice that even
the example gives you a sort

706
00:39:22 --> 00:39:24
of a eww kind of feeling.
 

707
00:39:24 --> 00:39:27
We have a sort of a gut, built
in reaction that there are some

708
00:39:27 --> 00:39:31
relationships that are OK and
some relationships

709
00:39:31 --> 00:39:32
that are odd.
 

710
00:39:32 --> 00:39:40
And so relationships and in
particular, relationships--

711
00:39:40 --> 00:39:43
guys can go and pursue
fertile females.

712
00:39:43 --> 00:39:44
That's OK.
 

713
00:39:44 --> 00:39:47
That can be shown in
the airline movie.

714
00:39:47 --> 00:39:50
Again, we don't have the
airline movie, the headline

715
00:39:50 --> 00:39:56
comes up the search for the
fertile woman, but ask yourself

716
00:39:56 --> 00:39:59
who it is-- who romantic
comedies are about?

717
00:39:59 --> 00:40:04
You wouldn't put a movie on the
airlines for family consumption

718
00:40:04 --> 00:40:08
about some guys unrequited
passion for a 9-year-old girl.

719
00:40:08 --> 00:40:10
It would seem icky.
 

720
00:40:10 --> 00:40:12
That there's something
wrong there.

721
00:40:12 --> 00:40:16
 
 

722
00:40:16 --> 00:40:17
Why?
 

723
00:40:17 --> 00:40:20
Presumably this has something
to do with the same

724
00:40:20 --> 00:40:23
sort of forces.
 

725
00:40:23 --> 00:40:33
OK, so let's move on a bit
to this, elaborate on this

726
00:40:33 --> 00:40:37
issue a bit, who should
be faithful in relations?

727
00:40:37 --> 00:40:39
Who should cheat?
 

728
00:40:39 --> 00:40:42
So let's start with guys.
 

729
00:40:42 --> 00:40:46
Now recognize here, by the way,
that we are talking again,

730
00:40:46 --> 00:40:50
within the context of this
evolutionary psych viewpoint.

731
00:40:50 --> 00:40:55
We are not saying who should
cheat in your relationship

732
00:40:55 --> 00:40:58
right now with the person
sitting next to you or

733
00:40:58 --> 00:40:58
something like that.
 

734
00:40:58 --> 00:41:01
Or who does society say
it's OK to cheat with.

735
00:41:01 --> 00:41:05
But in terms of this theory
about evolutionary forces

736
00:41:05 --> 00:41:09
working on mate selection, who
should have an evolutionary

737
00:41:09 --> 00:41:10
drive to cheat?
 

738
00:41:10 --> 00:41:11
Should guys?
 

739
00:41:11 --> 00:41:12
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
 

740
00:41:12 --> 00:41:13
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.
 

741
00:41:13 --> 00:41:16
That's a pretty
straightforward argument.

742
00:41:16 --> 00:41:20
That if you can get away with
it, if you can have a few no

743
00:41:20 --> 00:41:24
cost babies somewhere-- great.
 

744
00:41:24 --> 00:41:27
You've done your
evolutionary work.

745
00:41:27 --> 00:41:30
Look if we switched to a
different context of cultural,

746
00:41:30 --> 00:41:35
civilized world kind of you may
be a jerk, but you're an

747
00:41:35 --> 00:41:39
evolutionary successful jerk.
 

748
00:41:39 --> 00:41:42
OK, how about women?
 

749
00:41:42 --> 00:41:47
Should women be unfaithful
and play around?

750
00:41:47 --> 00:41:49
AUDIENCE: Yes.
 

751
00:41:49 --> 00:41:51
PROFESSOR: OK, yes argument.
 

752
00:41:51 --> 00:41:52
What's the yes argument?
 

753
00:41:52 --> 00:41:55
Again, from an evolutionary
point of view.

754
00:41:55 --> 00:41:57
AUDIENCE: Like a stronger mate.
 

755
00:41:57 --> 00:41:58
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you might
get a stronger mate.

756
00:41:58 --> 00:42:02
You're hedging your
genetic bets.

757
00:42:02 --> 00:42:09
If you are going to link up
with this guy, maybe he turns

758
00:42:09 --> 00:42:11
out to be a genetic dud.
 

759
00:42:11 --> 00:42:15
If you just have your
18 babies with him you

760
00:42:15 --> 00:42:18
know, how good is that?
 

761
00:42:18 --> 00:42:23
But if you spread it around a
bit, your genes are the same

762
00:42:23 --> 00:42:25
in all cases, who cares?
 

763
00:42:25 --> 00:42:27
You're always get your
half of the package.

764
00:42:27 --> 00:42:30
And so you might as well
mix it up a bit and so

765
00:42:30 --> 00:42:32
that's the yes argument.
 

766
00:42:32 --> 00:42:39
 
 

767
00:42:39 --> 00:42:41
Any other yes arguments?
 

768
00:42:41 --> 00:42:43
Yep?
 

769
00:42:43 --> 00:42:46
AUDIENCE: You could have sex
with a guy with better genes,

770
00:42:46 --> 00:42:50
but remain more faithful to
the guy with more resource.

771
00:42:50 --> 00:42:50
PROFESSOR: Yes, OK.
 

772
00:42:50 --> 00:42:53
This is a particular version
of the more general argument.

773
00:42:53 --> 00:42:55
There's a resource
argument here.

774
00:42:55 --> 00:42:59
He's giving a particular
version, which is go have sex

775
00:42:59 --> 00:43:03
with the guy with the good
genes and snooker the guy with

776
00:43:03 --> 00:43:07
the good resources and convince
him that it's his kid.

777
00:43:07 --> 00:43:11
So he devotes the resources
to raise his genes.

778
00:43:11 --> 00:43:19
More generally, you might
just play around, just shop

779
00:43:19 --> 00:43:22
around because you get
more resources in general.

780
00:43:22 --> 00:43:26
Guys will give you stuff
in some fashion or other.

781
00:43:26 --> 00:43:29
So there might be sort of a
quasi economic-- go out and get

782
00:43:29 --> 00:43:33
the goodies kind of bargain.
 

783
00:43:33 --> 00:43:35
OK, those are good
yes arguments.

784
00:43:35 --> 00:43:37
How about no arguments?
 

785
00:43:37 --> 00:43:41
Against the notion of-- yeah?
 

786
00:43:41 --> 00:43:43
AUDIENCE: You could
lose the resources.

787
00:43:43 --> 00:43:44
PROFESSOR: You could
lose the resources.

788
00:43:44 --> 00:43:46
Why would you lose
the resources?

789
00:43:46 --> 00:43:47
What's the guy's problem?
 

790
00:43:47 --> 00:43:49
AUDIENCE: Not his kid.
 

791
00:43:49 --> 00:43:51
PROFESSOR: It's not his kid.
 

792
00:43:51 --> 00:43:55
And this is a crucial issue.
 

793
00:43:55 --> 00:43:58
Again, another part of this
fundamental asymmetry.

794
00:43:58 --> 00:44:02
Because it's the woman who
gets pres-- president right.

795
00:44:02 --> 00:44:07
The woman who gets
pregnant, she always

796
00:44:07 --> 00:44:10
knows who the mother is.
 

797
00:44:10 --> 00:44:11
Actually, he knows who
the mother is, too.

798
00:44:11 --> 00:44:13
There's no doubt about
who the mother is.

799
00:44:13 --> 00:44:18
 
 

800
00:44:18 --> 00:44:22
The maternal genes are not
an issue here, paternal

801
00:44:22 --> 00:44:24
genes are an issue.
 

802
00:44:24 --> 00:44:27
 
 

803
00:44:27 --> 00:44:34
And doubts about paternity have
a variety of consequences.

804
00:44:34 --> 00:44:39
Male sexual jealousy is
a real and potentially

805
00:44:39 --> 00:44:41
dangerous phenomenon.
 

806
00:44:41 --> 00:44:47
In fact, I don't think there
are any states where it's still

807
00:44:47 --> 00:44:52
the case-- there were states
where it was the case that

808
00:44:52 --> 00:44:58
killing an unfaithful
wife was not murder.

809
00:44:58 --> 00:45:00
I don't think it was ever
the other way around.

810
00:45:00 --> 00:45:03
You couldn't kill your
unfaithful husband, but killing

811
00:45:03 --> 00:45:09
the unfaithful wife wasn't
necessarily a laudable act, but

812
00:45:09 --> 00:45:13
it wasn't murder in the way
that killing somebody else was.

813
00:45:13 --> 00:45:15
I don't believe that-- anybody
happen to know that they come

814
00:45:15 --> 00:45:18
from a state where you can
still do that with impunity?

815
00:45:18 --> 00:45:21
 
 

816
00:45:21 --> 00:45:23
I think Louisiana was the last.
 

817
00:45:23 --> 00:45:28
 
 

818
00:45:28 --> 00:45:32
Oh, and there are interesting
wrinkles on this.

819
00:45:32 --> 00:45:36
 
 

820
00:45:36 --> 00:45:41
When a baby is born the
first question anybody asks

821
00:45:41 --> 00:45:42
is, is it a boy or girl?
 

822
00:45:42 --> 00:45:47
Which is an interesting factoid
in its own right, but sort of

823
00:45:47 --> 00:45:49
the second topic of
conversation is, who

824
00:45:49 --> 00:45:51
does the kid look like?
 

825
00:45:51 --> 00:45:54
And what's the answer?
 

826
00:45:54 --> 00:45:59
The answer is a bias towards
saying that the kid

827
00:45:59 --> 00:46:02
looks like the father.
 

828
00:46:02 --> 00:46:05
Now why should
that be the case?

829
00:46:05 --> 00:46:07
And it turns out that the
bias is strong-- it depends

830
00:46:07 --> 00:46:08
who's giving the answer.
 

831
00:46:08 --> 00:46:12
The answer by the wife's
family-- by the mother's

832
00:46:12 --> 00:46:16
family-- is more skewed
towards saying it

833
00:46:16 --> 00:46:19
looks like the father.
 

834
00:46:19 --> 00:46:22
And there are at least two
reasons why this is the case.

835
00:46:22 --> 00:46:25
One of them seems to be an
effort-- again, quite

836
00:46:25 --> 00:46:29
unconscious to prove to the dad
you don't have to say it looks

837
00:46:29 --> 00:46:32
like the mother, we know
who the mother is.

838
00:46:32 --> 00:46:35
Saying it looks like the father
is reassuring to the father who

839
00:46:35 --> 00:46:39
might otherwise deny resource
to this kid or go out and kill

840
00:46:39 --> 00:46:42
the mother-- something
inconvenient like that.

841
00:46:42 --> 00:46:44
So it's important to
believe that this is

842
00:46:44 --> 00:46:46
your bundle of genes.
 

843
00:46:46 --> 00:46:50
The guy is in theoretical
doubt, the woman

844
00:46:50 --> 00:46:51
is not in doubt.
 

845
00:46:51 --> 00:46:55
The other reason why it may be
true is there is some evidence

846
00:46:55 --> 00:47:00
that babies actually look more
like their fathers when they're

847
00:47:00 --> 00:47:04
young and that this
wears off with age.

848
00:47:04 --> 00:47:07
If this is true it would be an
interesting argument for this

849
00:47:07 --> 00:47:12
evolutionary pressure because
babies who looked clearly like

850
00:47:12 --> 00:47:18
dad probably had a little edge
because dad looked at this

851
00:47:18 --> 00:47:21
little bundle of joy
and said, it's mine.

852
00:47:21 --> 00:47:28
And if the kid looked like the
milkman or something, the kid

853
00:47:28 --> 00:47:31
may not have-- actually, can
you even use that as

854
00:47:31 --> 00:47:32
an example anymore?
 

855
00:47:32 --> 00:47:35
Are there still
milkmen out there?

856
00:47:35 --> 00:47:38
It used to be.
 

857
00:47:38 --> 00:47:40
It's a sort of an anachronism,
like talking about

858
00:47:40 --> 00:47:44
dialing the phone.
 

859
00:47:44 --> 00:47:49
This is a very mid 50s kind of
anachronistic sort of cliche

860
00:47:49 --> 00:47:54
about the woman who would be at
home, the milkman, who would be

861
00:47:54 --> 00:47:57
the man who delivered the milk
since you didn't go to the

862
00:47:57 --> 00:48:02
supermarket to buy milk-- it
came to your house and then

863
00:48:02 --> 00:48:05
various other things
happened and anyway.

864
00:48:05 --> 00:48:10
So much for cultural
enlightenment here.

865
00:48:10 --> 00:48:17
So in any case, there's a
pressure for women to be

866
00:48:17 --> 00:48:23
faithful because of basically,
in some fashion because of the

867
00:48:23 --> 00:48:33
danger of alienating the
male in some way or other.

868
00:48:33 --> 00:48:37
There's a problem here,
sort of a problem.

869
00:48:37 --> 00:48:40
There's a potential
problem with this.

870
00:48:40 --> 00:48:43
If you think about it we've
just come up with a theory that

871
00:48:43 --> 00:48:47
explains why women should be
faithful and shouldn't

872
00:48:47 --> 00:48:48
be faithful.
 

873
00:48:48 --> 00:48:53
And in fact, we could elaborate
on this and say that the

874
00:48:53 --> 00:49:00
evolutionary pressures should
cause-- you could argue that

875
00:49:00 --> 00:49:03
the evolutionary pressures
could push women to have less

876
00:49:03 --> 00:49:06
of a sex drive therefore,
making them more likely to

877
00:49:06 --> 00:49:09
remain faithful or you could
have it explain that they have

878
00:49:09 --> 00:49:11
just the same sex drive, but
they're supposed to

879
00:49:11 --> 00:49:12
deny the existence.
 

880
00:49:12 --> 00:49:14
You can have a lot of
different explanations.

881
00:49:14 --> 00:49:17
 
 

882
00:49:17 --> 00:49:21
This is a problem with the
theory, a theory that explains

883
00:49:21 --> 00:49:25
all possible outcomes
isn't a great theory.

884
00:49:25 --> 00:49:29
On the other hand, in human
mating behavior all the

885
00:49:29 --> 00:49:32
possible outcomes
are out there.

886
00:49:32 --> 00:49:34
So you don't want to have a
theory that just explains one

887
00:49:34 --> 00:49:37
thing because that wouldn't be
an adequate theory here either.

888
00:49:37 --> 00:49:41
I think the fairer thing to say
about evolutionary theory is

889
00:49:41 --> 00:49:46
that it hasn't reached a degree
of sophistication where it can

890
00:49:46 --> 00:49:51
explain in detail when a woman
should or should

891
00:49:51 --> 00:49:53
not be faithful.
 

892
00:49:53 --> 00:49:56
There are examples elsewhere
of these sort of trade-off

893
00:49:56 --> 00:50:00
situations that evolutionary
sorts of theories

894
00:50:00 --> 00:50:01
explain rather well.
 

895
00:50:01 --> 00:50:06
So an example, sort of
in the same ballpark,

896
00:50:06 --> 00:50:07
comes from cuckoos.
 

897
00:50:07 --> 00:50:09
You know about cuckoos?
 

898
00:50:09 --> 00:50:11
Cuckoos are nasty birds.
 

899
00:50:11 --> 00:50:17
Cuckoos like to lay their eggs
in somebody else's nest because

900
00:50:17 --> 00:50:20
this business of raising kids
is resource intensive and

901
00:50:20 --> 00:50:24
if you can get somebody
else to do it, great.

902
00:50:24 --> 00:50:28
So cuckoos lay their eggs in
somebody else's nest and it

903
00:50:28 --> 00:50:36
gets better from there because
the cuckoo egg hatches early

904
00:50:36 --> 00:50:40
and the cuckoo chick has this
lovely reflex where what it

905
00:50:40 --> 00:50:43
does is it arches its little
cuckoo back and kicks

906
00:50:43 --> 00:50:45
the other eggs out.
 

907
00:50:45 --> 00:50:51
So it kills off its adopted
siblings and then it sits there

908
00:50:51 --> 00:50:56
making I'm hungry noises and
gets fed by genetically

909
00:50:56 --> 00:50:57
unrelated birds.
 

910
00:50:57 --> 00:51:00
 
 

911
00:51:00 --> 00:51:03
There's an obvious
problem here.

912
00:51:03 --> 00:51:06
It's in the cuckoos interest
to do this, but you can't

913
00:51:06 --> 00:51:08
have too many cuckoos.
 

914
00:51:08 --> 00:51:12
If cuckoos do this to every
nest then there's no next

915
00:51:12 --> 00:51:14
generation because there's
nobody left dumb enough

916
00:51:14 --> 00:51:18
to raise your kids in
the next generation.

917
00:51:18 --> 00:51:22
So there's an equilibrium, you
can write down equations for

918
00:51:22 --> 00:51:28
this that say a healthy
population can tolerate this

919
00:51:28 --> 00:51:31
many cuckoos; this
many cheaters.

920
00:51:31 --> 00:51:36
You might ask by the way, why
the stupid bird-- the stupid

921
00:51:36 --> 00:51:42
sparrow or whatever who's got
a cuckoo in her nest doesn't

922
00:51:42 --> 00:51:44
say, get out of here.
 

923
00:51:44 --> 00:51:52
And the problem seems to be
that the cuckoo behaves as a

924
00:51:52 --> 00:51:57
sort of a supernormal
baby stimulus.

925
00:51:57 --> 00:52:03
You as a mommy sparrow or
daddy sparrow-- you are built

926
00:52:03 --> 00:52:05
to say, oh, look at that.
 

927
00:52:05 --> 00:52:08
It's cute, it's a baby,
I want to feed it.

928
00:52:08 --> 00:52:11
And your success is whether
this thing is growing.

929
00:52:11 --> 00:52:14
And here's this honking,
huge cuckoo baby.

930
00:52:14 --> 00:52:16
Wow, I hit the jackpot.
 

931
00:52:16 --> 00:52:18
I got the greatest
baby in the world.

932
00:52:18 --> 00:52:21
Doesn't happen to be
genetically related to me,

933
00:52:21 --> 00:52:23
but it's a great baby.
 

934
00:52:23 --> 00:52:26
And so I stuff it
full of worms.

935
00:52:26 --> 00:52:29
Last year there was an article
about a species of I don't

936
00:52:29 --> 00:52:32
remember what, but some other
non cuckoo bird that has

937
00:52:32 --> 00:52:36
learned now how to recognize or
has evolved the ability to

938
00:52:36 --> 00:52:41
recognize the cuckoos and you
can't lay your cuckoo eggs in

939
00:52:41 --> 00:52:45
those nests because that
species will get rid of you

940
00:52:45 --> 00:52:46
and preserve their own.
 

941
00:52:46 --> 00:52:49
But anyway, there's an
equilibrium state here.

942
00:52:49 --> 00:52:52
You have a balance that
tolerates a certain

943
00:52:52 --> 00:52:54
amount of cheating.
 

944
00:52:54 --> 00:53:01
The same thing happens in human
relationships though the

945
00:53:01 --> 00:53:03
details are much more
complicated to work out.

946
00:53:03 --> 00:53:05
But do people lie?
 

947
00:53:05 --> 00:53:07
AUDIENCE: Yes.
 

948
00:53:07 --> 00:53:08
PROFESSOR: Yeah, sure.
 

949
00:53:08 --> 00:53:10
Do people lie all the time?
 

950
00:53:10 --> 00:53:12
No, you can't do that.
 

951
00:53:12 --> 00:53:17
You can't have an arbitrary
relationship between truth and

952
00:53:17 --> 00:53:21
udderances cannot have
arbitrary truth value because

953
00:53:21 --> 00:53:23
then there wouldn't be any
point to communication.

954
00:53:23 --> 00:53:29
So on average people as a
whole have to tell the truth.

955
00:53:29 --> 00:53:31
Does everybody have to tell
the same amount of truth?

956
00:53:31 --> 00:53:36
No, the population can
tolerate some amount

957
00:53:36 --> 00:53:39
of real liars, right?
 

958
00:53:39 --> 00:53:43
Pathological, lying through
their teeth all the time.

959
00:53:43 --> 00:53:45
Oh yes, I love you baby.
 

960
00:53:45 --> 00:53:47
I will devote all my
resources to you.

961
00:53:47 --> 00:53:52
Liars, or whatever realm it is,
but again, there's going to be

962
00:53:52 --> 00:53:56
an equilibrium equation
there somewhere.

963
00:53:56 --> 00:53:59
Not as well worked out as with
cuckoos that says, we can

964
00:53:59 --> 00:54:02
only tolerate so many liars.
 

965
00:54:02 --> 00:54:06
So you could ask the question,
is there motivation for guys

966
00:54:06 --> 00:54:10
to lie in relationships?
 

967
00:54:10 --> 00:54:11
Are you seeing anybody else?
 

968
00:54:11 --> 00:54:14
Oh no, not me.
 

969
00:54:14 --> 00:54:20
If everybody lies about
that the game falls apart.

970
00:54:20 --> 00:54:24
If some people lie about
it they get away with it.

971
00:54:24 --> 00:54:27
So the population as a
whole will tolerate some

972
00:54:27 --> 00:54:30
subset of cheaters.
 

973
00:54:30 --> 00:54:33
 
 

974
00:54:33 --> 00:54:38
One can have the hope-- the
theoretical hope that another

975
00:54:38 --> 00:54:40
few generations of work in the
area and you'd be able

976
00:54:40 --> 00:54:42
to write the equation.
 

977
00:54:42 --> 00:54:47
You'll be able to say, look,
a population like an

978
00:54:47 --> 00:54:53
undergraduate population can
tolerate 10% cheaters.

979
00:54:53 --> 00:54:56
If we've got 11% cheaters we
have to invoke the dean's

980
00:54:56 --> 00:55:00
office or something and throw
them out because the population

981
00:55:00 --> 00:55:01
will crash otherwise
or something.

982
00:55:01 --> 00:55:03
Anyway, we're nowhere
near that point.

983
00:55:03 --> 00:55:06
At this point we can't
write the equations.

984
00:55:06 --> 00:55:08
But that seems to be the way
you get to the solution

985
00:55:08 --> 00:55:11
to the problem.
 

986
00:55:11 --> 00:55:15
That the theory at the moment
predicts kind of everything.

987
00:55:15 --> 00:55:17
The theory also doesn't predict
the full range of behavior.

988
00:55:17 --> 00:55:22
I see I've got these problems
listed on the handout.

989
00:55:22 --> 00:55:26
In particular, it's explaining
group behavior, explaining the

990
00:55:26 --> 00:55:28
behavior of individuals is
something that I'll get

991
00:55:28 --> 00:55:29
to in the next lecture.
 

992
00:55:29 --> 00:55:31
Actually, I'll get to
some of it later in

993
00:55:31 --> 00:55:33
the present lecture.
 

994
00:55:33 --> 00:55:35
And the third problem, let
me say a bit about that

995
00:55:35 --> 00:55:38
before we take a break.
 

996
00:55:38 --> 00:55:41
Is that civilization may
have changed the rules.

997
00:55:41 --> 00:55:45
One of the most striking--
there's several

998
00:55:45 --> 00:55:46
examples of this.
 

999
00:55:46 --> 00:55:50
One of them is if you were
operating in a sort of a purely

1000
00:55:50 --> 00:55:55
Darwinian kind of a world that
would be very difficult

1001
00:55:55 --> 00:55:59
probably, but very different
than operating in a world where

1002
00:55:59 --> 00:56:03
you are being told explicitly
what is and is not

1003
00:56:03 --> 00:56:04
appropriate sexual behavior.
 

1004
00:56:04 --> 00:56:11
You're being told explicitly
that your genes, your

1005
00:56:11 --> 00:56:13
evolutionary history if you're
a male may be saying go off and

1006
00:56:13 --> 00:56:15
mate with everybody
under the sun.

1007
00:56:15 --> 00:56:19
But there are societal
strictures that

1008
00:56:19 --> 00:56:21
say, not really.
 

1009
00:56:21 --> 00:56:24
That's just not
quite really right.

1010
00:56:24 --> 00:56:28
So that complicates things, but
a more interesting complication

1011
00:56:28 --> 00:56:33
arises more recently in
history with the advent of

1012
00:56:33 --> 00:56:36
artificial contraception.
 

1013
00:56:36 --> 00:56:44
If the fundamental route to
these asymmetries is that women

1014
00:56:44 --> 00:56:48
get pregnant-- that sex makes
you pregnant and it's only

1015
00:56:48 --> 00:56:51
women that get pregnant, what
happens if you decouple

1016
00:56:51 --> 00:56:54
sex from pregnancy?
 

1017
00:56:54 --> 00:56:57
Does it change the game?
 

1018
00:56:57 --> 00:56:59
Well, potentially yes.
 

1019
00:56:59 --> 00:57:04
It has not made these
asymmetries disappear.

1020
00:57:04 --> 00:57:07
That's a topic that I
will actually return

1021
00:57:07 --> 00:57:09
to in a later lecture.
 

1022
00:57:09 --> 00:57:13
It's not made these asymmetries
disappear and that suggests

1023
00:57:13 --> 00:57:19
that forces that shaped our
brains, the evolutionary forces

1024
00:57:19 --> 00:57:24
that shaped our brains over
long periods of time still

1025
00:57:24 --> 00:57:28
operate even though the
rules of the game have

1026
00:57:28 --> 00:57:29
changed somewhat.
 

1027
00:57:29 --> 00:57:33
You can get an intuitive
feeling for this-- let's

1028
00:57:33 --> 00:57:36
return to the question
of female fidelity.

1029
00:57:36 --> 00:57:37
Should a woman cheat?
 

1030
00:57:37 --> 00:57:42
Well, part of the answer to why
a female might be inclined not

1031
00:57:42 --> 00:57:46
to cheat in a relationship was
that the male might be jealous

1032
00:57:46 --> 00:57:49
and that would have a variety
of possible bad consequences;

1033
00:57:49 --> 00:57:53
withdrawal of resources or
potentially violence in some

1034
00:57:53 --> 00:57:55
fashion, something
bad might happen.

1035
00:57:55 --> 00:58:00
OK, how much do you think
that those bad consequences

1036
00:58:00 --> 00:58:01
are ameliorated.
 

1037
00:58:01 --> 00:58:05
If when she's confronted, you
know, did you cheat on me?

1038
00:58:05 --> 00:58:11
Yes, I cheated on you, but it's
OK because we took precautions.

1039
00:58:11 --> 00:58:14
Do you think that makes a
difference in the argument?

1040
00:58:14 --> 00:58:15
AUDIENCE: No.
 

1041
00:58:15 --> 00:58:19
PROFESSOR: No, intuitively
it doesn't seem likely that

1042
00:58:19 --> 00:58:21
it makes a difference.
 

1043
00:58:21 --> 00:58:31
Suggesting that the forces that
are driving these questions of

1044
00:58:31 --> 00:58:35
who should cheat and who
shouldn't cheat are walled

1045
00:58:35 --> 00:58:38
off from knowledge about
modern contraception.

1046
00:58:38 --> 00:58:43
In sort of the way that the
forces that are driving taste

1047
00:58:43 --> 00:58:45
aversions are walled off of
what you know about what

1048
00:58:45 --> 00:58:46
it is that made you sick.
 

1049
00:58:46 --> 00:58:49
Remember from earlier in the
course, you got sick because

1050
00:58:49 --> 00:58:52
you got the flu, but you ate a
tuna fish sandwich the day

1051
00:58:52 --> 00:58:55
before you got the flu and now
you can't eat tuna fish anymore

1052
00:58:55 --> 00:58:58
because this little chunk of
brain said, tuna fish poisoned

1053
00:58:58 --> 00:59:01
us, we never eat it again.
 

1054
00:59:01 --> 00:59:03
Same sort of story.
 

1055
00:59:03 --> 00:59:07
Somewhere in the brain is a
chunk of brain that is saying--

1056
00:59:07 --> 00:59:10
chunk of guy brain that is
saying, need to know

1057
00:59:10 --> 00:59:13
woman is faithful.
 

1058
00:59:13 --> 00:59:13
Why?
 

1059
00:59:13 --> 00:59:16
Well, because I need to
know whose genes they are.

1060
00:59:16 --> 00:59:17
Woman isn't pregnant.
 

1061
00:59:17 --> 00:59:20
I don't care.
 

1062
00:59:20 --> 00:59:24
I'm a very simple little chunk
of brain, I just need to know

1063
00:59:24 --> 00:59:32
woman is faithful or I have
unhappy things happen in me.

1064
00:59:32 --> 00:59:37
So the persistence of these
sorts of asymmetries and these

1065
00:59:37 --> 00:59:41
sorts of behaviors is another
argument that can be used to

1066
00:59:41 --> 00:59:47
argue that these are deep
seated behaviors

1067
00:59:47 --> 00:59:48
with evolution.
 

1068
00:59:48 --> 00:59:53
Oh, I should say, by the way,
that these are explanations

1069
00:59:53 --> 00:59:56
not excuses in any
way shape or form.

1070
00:59:56 --> 01:00:01
Coming home and flipping to
the other side of this right?

1071
01:00:01 --> 01:00:02
You're the guy this time.
 

1072
01:00:02 --> 01:00:03
Did your cheat?
 

1073
01:00:03 --> 01:00:06
Yes, but that's OK because I
have deep seated evolutionary

1074
01:00:06 --> 01:00:10
forces within me that make it
necessary for me to cheat.

1075
01:00:10 --> 01:00:12
That's an interesting
explanation, but it's not an

1076
01:00:12 --> 01:00:18
excuse in a relationship any
more than it's an excuse.

1077
01:00:18 --> 01:00:24
Yes, I hit my girlfriend
because I was jealous.

1078
01:00:24 --> 01:00:28
You know, great, lovely, we
have these great evolutionary

1079
01:00:28 --> 01:00:28
arguments for it.
 

1080
01:00:28 --> 01:00:30
That's not an excuse.
 

1081
01:00:30 --> 01:00:33
That's where you get into
again, why these things are

1082
01:00:33 --> 01:00:39
politically controversial, is
the possibility of turning

1083
01:00:39 --> 01:00:42
explanation into excuse.
 

1084
01:00:42 --> 01:00:46
You can decide well, to use an
example that I will probably

1085
01:00:46 --> 01:00:52
use again, it's a little like
saying, look gravity

1086
01:00:52 --> 01:00:53
is a force.
 

1087
01:00:53 --> 01:00:56
You can't thwart gravity,
so I'm just going to

1088
01:00:56 --> 01:00:59
lie here forever.
 

1089
01:00:59 --> 01:01:00
Oops, lost the glasses.
 

1090
01:01:00 --> 01:01:01
Where'd the glasses go?
 

1091
01:01:01 --> 01:01:05
That's a really stupid argument
and it's similarly stupid to

1092
01:01:05 --> 01:01:08
say biology is a powerful
force, therefore I

1093
01:01:08 --> 01:01:11
had to do whatever.
 

1094
01:01:11 --> 01:01:14
There are other powerful forces
out there in civilization:

1095
01:01:14 --> 01:01:17
morality, culture, whatever are
powerful forces and if they say

1096
01:01:17 --> 01:01:21
don't do it, it may be hard
work not to do it, but that

1097
01:01:21 --> 01:01:22
doesn't mean you
shouldn't do it.

1098
01:01:22 --> 01:01:25
Or you should do-- whatever,
you got the basic idea.

1099
01:01:25 --> 01:01:28
Well on that sentence with way
too many double negatives in

1100
01:01:28 --> 01:01:33
it, let us take a brief break
and then I'll turn

1101
01:01:33 --> 01:01:35
to the question of
individual behavior.

1102
01:01:35 --> 01:01:38
 
 

1103
01:01:38 --> 01:02:11
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
 

1104
01:02:11 --> 01:02:12
PROFESSOR: Oh, thank you.
 

1105
01:02:12 --> 01:02:37
 
 

1106
01:02:37 --> 01:02:39
AUDIENCE: Should we do it
before-- I mean, after they

1107
01:02:39 --> 01:02:40
come back from the break maybe?
 

1108
01:02:40 --> 01:02:43
Or would you prefer at the end?
 

1109
01:02:43 --> 01:02:45
 
 

1110
01:02:45 --> 01:02:46
PROFESSOR: We [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

1111
01:02:46 --> 01:02:48
AUDIENCE: Basically what it is
we're doing the comedy passes,

1112
01:02:48 --> 01:02:50
whoever wants one we just
have to pass them out.

1113
01:02:50 --> 01:02:53
PROFESSOR: Oh no, if you're
going to pass stuff out,

1114
01:02:53 --> 01:02:54
be here at the end.
 

1115
01:02:54 --> 01:02:57
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
 

1116
01:02:57 --> 01:03:02
PROFESSOR: Yep,
I'll do my best.

1117
01:03:02 --> 01:03:03
Will it be funny?
 

1118
01:03:03 --> 01:03:05
 
 

1119
01:03:05 --> 01:03:08
Quick, funny announcement.
 

1120
01:03:08 --> 01:03:10
All right, so be here
in about 20 minutes.

1121
01:03:10 --> 01:03:12
AUDIENCE: Yeah, no problem.
 

1122
01:03:12 --> 01:03:15
 
 

1123
01:03:15 --> 01:03:18
PROFESSOR: So, let
me elaborate.

1124
01:03:18 --> 01:03:20
I realized looking at the
handout that I didn't elaborate

1125
01:03:20 --> 01:03:26
particularly well on this
problem 2 part about these

1126
01:03:26 --> 01:03:30
evolutionary theories
not explaining the full

1127
01:03:30 --> 01:03:33
range of behavior well.
 

1128
01:03:33 --> 01:03:41
So it explains perhaps-- the
theory as elaborated thus far

1129
01:03:41 --> 01:03:45
explains for instance, why you
might be attracted to one

1130
01:03:45 --> 01:03:47
person or another, but it
doesn't explain what you

1131
01:03:47 --> 01:03:50
do in any particular way.
 

1132
01:03:50 --> 01:03:56
So you see an attractive,
potential mate, if you're birds

1133
01:03:56 --> 01:03:58
you might do some sort of
weird mating dance or

1134
01:03:58 --> 01:04:00
something like that.
 

1135
01:04:00 --> 01:04:03
If you're a human you might
do some weird mating dance

1136
01:04:03 --> 01:04:05
or something like that.
 

1137
01:04:05 --> 01:04:09
You can ask yourself about
what do you do if there's an

1138
01:04:09 --> 01:04:12
attractive mate possibility?
 

1139
01:04:12 --> 01:04:17
You could dance, you could hang
around, you could act pathetic,

1140
01:04:17 --> 01:04:20
you could act non-pathetic.
 

1141
01:04:20 --> 01:04:25
You could get person A to talk
to person B and who knows C,

1142
01:04:25 --> 01:04:28
who's the uncle of D or
something like that.

1143
01:04:28 --> 01:04:31
 
 

1144
01:04:31 --> 01:04:33
Just knowing that there was
evolutionary pressure here

1145
01:04:33 --> 01:04:37
isn't really a full story about
human mating behavior by any

1146
01:04:37 --> 01:04:39
stretch of the imagination.
 

1147
01:04:39 --> 01:04:43
What's going to elaborate on
it, you can probably get a good

1148
01:04:43 --> 01:04:47
piece of mileage from asking
about law of effect

1149
01:04:47 --> 01:04:49
kinds of things.
 

1150
01:04:49 --> 01:04:53
What you do in mating
situations or courtship

1151
01:04:53 --> 01:04:57
situations is going to be
shaped, at least in part, by

1152
01:04:57 --> 01:05:01
the schedule of reinforcement.
 

1153
01:05:01 --> 01:05:08
You do a mating dance and the
potential mate responds, you're

1154
01:05:08 --> 01:05:10
going to be inclined to do that
dance more-- it's not

1155
01:05:10 --> 01:05:11
why birds do it.
 

1156
01:05:11 --> 01:05:14
Birds are wired typically to do
the dance, but if you go off

1157
01:05:14 --> 01:05:19
and do some weird dance and he
or she says, hey, this is good.

1158
01:05:19 --> 01:05:20
You'll do it again.
 

1159
01:05:20 --> 01:05:25
 
 

1160
01:05:25 --> 01:05:27
The whole ritual, I don't know
what you want to call-- who

1161
01:05:27 --> 01:05:32
touches who when, where, and
how is also heavily shaped by

1162
01:05:32 --> 01:05:35
law of effect sorts of things.
 

1163
01:05:35 --> 01:05:38
If it's rewarded
it happens again.

1164
01:05:38 --> 01:05:41
If it's not rewarded it
doesn't happen again.

1165
01:05:41 --> 01:05:45
More on this later, but I did
want to just say that there's

1166
01:05:45 --> 01:05:48
nothing in these sort of
evolutionary psych theory

1167
01:05:48 --> 01:05:52
that really talks to that.
 

1168
01:05:52 --> 01:06:05
Now let me go onto try to say
what does talk about individual

1169
01:06:05 --> 01:06:10
behavior in romantic
relationships.

1170
01:06:10 --> 01:06:16
You know, to get beyond this
notion of what average

1171
01:06:16 --> 01:06:20
populations do in a world full
of potential mates, why are you

1172
01:06:20 --> 01:06:24
attracted to this one now?
 

1173
01:06:24 --> 01:06:28
What can we say about that?
 

1174
01:06:28 --> 01:06:30
There certainly seems to
be something to explain.

1175
01:06:30 --> 01:06:31
There are a variety of
candidate sorts of

1176
01:06:31 --> 01:06:33
theories out there.
 

1177
01:06:33 --> 01:06:39
One of them is nicely
encapsulated in shakes-- oh I

1178
01:06:39 --> 01:06:44
realized I didn't put the most
clear cut piece of citation on

1179
01:06:44 --> 01:06:46
that quote at the bottom of
page 3-- That's Midsummer

1180
01:06:46 --> 01:06:47
Night's Dream.
 

1181
01:06:47 --> 01:06:51
Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's
Dream and Shakespeare has

1182
01:06:51 --> 01:06:55
Theseus, Duke of Athens say,
that lovers and madmen have

1183
01:06:55 --> 01:07:00
such seething brains, such
shaping fantasies that

1184
01:07:00 --> 01:07:03
apprehend more than cool
reason ever comprehends.

1185
01:07:03 --> 01:07:06
The lunatic, the lover,
and the poet are of

1186
01:07:06 --> 01:07:08
imagination all compact.
 

1187
01:07:08 --> 01:07:12
This is a theory of romantic
behavior that says you're

1188
01:07:12 --> 01:07:15
attracted to whom you're
attracted to at the moment and

1189
01:07:15 --> 01:07:19
you're doing what you're doing
in response to that now

1190
01:07:19 --> 01:07:21
because you're nuts.
 

1191
01:07:21 --> 01:07:27
I mean, basically it's a form
of insanity, and not uncommon

1192
01:07:27 --> 01:07:31
theory that shows up
in literary circles.

1193
01:07:31 --> 01:07:33
 
 

1194
01:07:33 --> 01:07:38
The place to get some intuitive
feeling for that is to remember

1195
01:07:38 --> 01:07:42
what it felt like if you were
ever completely infatuated

1196
01:07:42 --> 01:07:44
with somebody.
 

1197
01:07:44 --> 01:07:46
Preferably somebody who
didn't know you were

1198
01:07:46 --> 01:07:49
infatuated with them.
 

1199
01:07:49 --> 01:07:55
Some random other person across
the crowded room kind of thing.

1200
01:07:55 --> 01:07:59
That has the feeling of being
more or less, out of your mind.

1201
01:07:59 --> 01:08:05
But you don't realize at the
time and reams of bad high

1202
01:08:05 --> 01:08:09
school poetry are written
unders those conditions.

1203
01:08:09 --> 01:08:13
And if you're very lucky
nobody else gets to see

1204
01:08:13 --> 01:08:15
that stuff, mostly.
 

1205
01:08:15 --> 01:08:18
 
 

1206
01:08:18 --> 01:08:21
In my experience, back when I
was in high school-- how many

1207
01:08:21 --> 01:08:23
people have ever seen a
book called Jonathan

1208
01:08:23 --> 01:08:25
Livingston Seagull?
 

1209
01:08:25 --> 01:08:27
Oh, it's still out there.
 

1210
01:08:27 --> 01:08:29
It's very sappy.
 

1211
01:08:29 --> 01:08:33
And it was this sort of thing
you gave to somebody who you

1212
01:08:33 --> 01:08:38
were deeply in love with,
preferably in high school.

1213
01:08:38 --> 01:08:43
And it turns out that both my
wife and I have copies of this

1214
01:08:43 --> 01:08:48
book given to us by people
other than each other because

1215
01:08:48 --> 01:08:50
we didn't know each other in
high school-- both with

1216
01:08:50 --> 01:08:58
inscriptions so florid that
you just can't read them.

1217
01:08:58 --> 01:09:00
One of these I mean, why
haven't we destroyed them?

1218
01:09:00 --> 01:09:03
Well, there's a certain
nostalgia there of some sort

1219
01:09:03 --> 01:09:06
and you gotta save these
things for your children.

1220
01:09:06 --> 01:09:12
One day one of my kids is going
to be up in the attic and find

1221
01:09:12 --> 01:09:19
this thing and read it and
fall down dead laughing.

1222
01:09:19 --> 01:09:24
All right, the relevant
question here is that's not a

1223
01:09:24 --> 01:09:30
bad theory, why isn't this the
abnormal psych part

1224
01:09:30 --> 01:09:31
of the course?
 

1225
01:09:31 --> 01:09:34
Why aren't we talking
about love in the context

1226
01:09:34 --> 01:09:35
of psychopathology?
 

1227
01:09:35 --> 01:09:38
 
 

1228
01:09:38 --> 01:09:41
What's the answer?
 

1229
01:09:41 --> 01:09:43
Nobody knows what
the answer is.

1230
01:09:43 --> 01:09:43
Yep?
 

1231
01:09:43 --> 01:09:45
AUDIENCE: Psychopathology
generally deals with things

1232
01:09:45 --> 01:09:48
that are [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

1233
01:09:48 --> 01:09:51
PROFESSOR: Yeah, there's a
reason it's called abnormal

1234
01:09:51 --> 01:09:53
psychology as a
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

1235
01:09:53 --> 01:09:58
Now look, I don't know quite
what would happen if bad people

1236
01:09:58 --> 01:10:02
found a way to put something
in the water that made us

1237
01:10:02 --> 01:10:04
floridly schizophrenic.
 

1238
01:10:04 --> 01:10:08
If it became the majority state
it would still be

1239
01:10:08 --> 01:10:11
psychopathological probably,
but by and large what we talk

1240
01:10:11 --> 01:10:18
about in abnormal psychology is
abnormal and being in love may

1241
01:10:18 --> 01:10:20
be a sort of insanity, but it's
a very-- well look,

1242
01:10:20 --> 01:10:22
Shakespeare knew this too.
 

1243
01:10:22 --> 01:10:25
So if we borrow from As You
Like It, we have the

1244
01:10:25 --> 01:10:33
explanation of this given in
this case by Rosalind in As You

1245
01:10:33 --> 01:10:36
Like It saying that love is
merely madness, merely a

1246
01:10:36 --> 01:10:39
madness and I tell you,
deserves a dark house and

1247
01:10:39 --> 01:10:41
a whip as madman do.
 

1248
01:10:41 --> 01:10:45
Which tells you something about
Elizabethan psychotherapy.

1249
01:10:45 --> 01:10:49
The reason they are not so
punished and cured, which also

1250
01:10:49 --> 01:10:52
tells you something about
Elizabethan psychotherapy; the

1251
01:10:52 --> 01:10:55
notion was not that you were
just being nasty to crazy

1252
01:10:55 --> 01:10:58
people, but that being
nasty was curative.

1253
01:10:58 --> 01:11:01
The reason they are not so
punished and cured is that the

1254
01:11:01 --> 01:11:06
lunacy is so ordinary that the
whippers are in love too.

1255
01:11:06 --> 01:11:10
It doesn't make any real sense,
it's not a useful theory to say

1256
01:11:10 --> 01:11:14
that being in love is a form of
insanity because it's

1257
01:11:14 --> 01:11:17
essentially a universal
form of insanity.

1258
01:11:17 --> 01:11:23
You might think that there's
nothing much to say in an intro

1259
01:11:23 --> 01:11:26
psych class about this at all
and that the whole topic is

1260
01:11:26 --> 01:11:30
kind of best left to
Shakespeare and other

1261
01:11:30 --> 01:11:31
literary sources.
 

1262
01:11:31 --> 01:11:35
That's actually not a bad
argument, but I think there is

1263
01:11:35 --> 01:11:41
something useful to be said in
the context of psychology.

1264
01:11:41 --> 01:11:44
We can switch back to
Shakespeare and ask-- wait,

1265
01:11:44 --> 01:11:46
first we have to check on
how high school education

1266
01:11:46 --> 01:11:47
is going these days.
 

1267
01:11:47 --> 01:11:49
How many people have to
read Romeo and Juliet in

1268
01:11:49 --> 01:11:50
high school somewhere?
 

1269
01:11:50 --> 01:11:51
OK, good.
 

1270
01:11:51 --> 01:11:52
Just checking.
 

1271
01:11:52 --> 01:11:55
 
 

1272
01:11:55 --> 01:12:01
Romeo is looking across a
crowded dancehall here and he

1273
01:12:01 --> 01:12:07
sees Juliet and he's supposed
to be in love with?

1274
01:12:07 --> 01:12:08
AUDIENCE: Rosaline.
 

1275
01:12:08 --> 01:12:09
PROFESSOR: Rosaline.
 

1276
01:12:09 --> 01:12:12
Good, you got that question
right on the test.

1277
01:12:12 --> 01:12:14
He's been mooning around
about this woman Rosaline.

1278
01:12:14 --> 01:12:18
He walks in, he sees Juliet and
it's oh, she doth make the

1279
01:12:18 --> 01:12:20
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].
 

1280
01:12:20 --> 01:12:23
You can see why I'm not
a Shakespearian actor.

1281
01:12:23 --> 01:12:27
She doth teach the torches
to burn bright and

1282
01:12:27 --> 01:12:28
all that good stuff.
 

1283
01:12:28 --> 01:12:32
 
 

1284
01:12:32 --> 01:12:33
Why?
 

1285
01:12:33 --> 01:12:35
What can you say about it?
 

1286
01:12:35 --> 01:12:36
There are a variety of things.
 

1287
01:12:36 --> 01:12:38
Well, we can develop what
we can call the chemical

1288
01:12:38 --> 01:12:39
theory of love here.
 

1289
01:12:39 --> 01:12:42
We passed through the insanity
theory, let's work on the

1290
01:12:42 --> 01:12:45
chemical theory a little bit.
 

1291
01:12:45 --> 01:12:48
Chemical theory gets you
a certain distance.

1292
01:12:48 --> 01:12:49
Oh, I didn't put this on
the handout yet because

1293
01:12:49 --> 01:12:53
I wasn't convinced I
was going to get here.

1294
01:12:53 --> 01:12:55
I'll put a few of these terms
on there next time, but

1295
01:12:55 --> 01:12:57
you could write on the
back of the handout.

1296
01:12:57 --> 01:13:02
So chemical aspects.
 

1297
01:13:02 --> 01:13:06
One thing that's related
to chemical aspects is

1298
01:13:06 --> 01:13:08
the proximity factor.
 

1299
01:13:08 --> 01:13:15
You want to get two things to
interact and make heat, you

1300
01:13:15 --> 01:13:17
gotta bring them together.
 

1301
01:13:17 --> 01:13:25
It sounds trivial, but the
scary version of this is that

1302
01:13:25 --> 01:13:30
a not insignificant number
of you will meet your

1303
01:13:30 --> 01:13:32
eventual mate here.
 

1304
01:13:32 --> 01:13:36
Not here like in 10-250
right now, but during your

1305
01:13:36 --> 01:13:40
undergraduate years at MIT.
 

1306
01:13:40 --> 01:13:45
So you know, somebody in this
room may be that person

1307
01:13:45 --> 01:13:46
or something like that.
 

1308
01:13:46 --> 01:13:49
One of the reasons is it's a
great deal easier to fall

1309
01:13:49 --> 01:13:53
in love with somebody you
actually interact with.

1310
01:13:53 --> 01:14:04
There are lovely people at Cal
Tech I'm told, but mostly-- no?

1311
01:14:04 --> 01:14:08
Well, there are bitter,
jealous, disappointed people

1312
01:14:08 --> 01:14:09
at Cal Tech I'm told.
 

1313
01:14:09 --> 01:14:14
All of whom actually wanted
to go to MIT, but anyway,

1314
01:14:14 --> 01:14:17
you see the point.
 

1315
01:14:17 --> 01:14:18
So proximity helps.
 

1316
01:14:18 --> 01:14:26
Now another chemical aspect of
this romantic love business is

1317
01:14:26 --> 01:14:30
that if you want a chemical
reaction to speed up one of

1318
01:14:30 --> 01:14:33
the things that's useful to
do is to add heat, right?

1319
01:14:33 --> 01:14:36
 
 

1320
01:14:36 --> 01:14:38
That works, too.
 

1321
01:14:38 --> 01:14:45
And it works in not just like
turning up the thermostat, but

1322
01:14:45 --> 01:14:52
you are more likely to fall in
love with somebody if your

1323
01:14:52 --> 01:14:55
arousal level is up.
 

1324
01:14:55 --> 01:14:57
That seems pretty obvious.
 

1325
01:14:57 --> 01:15:02
The non-obvious piece of it is
that you're pretty stupid about

1326
01:15:02 --> 01:15:05
this and you don't care
too much where the

1327
01:15:05 --> 01:15:06
arousal comes from.
 

1328
01:15:06 --> 01:15:10
The Romeo and Juliet thing
is not a bad example.

1329
01:15:10 --> 01:15:14
Romeo is which family?
 

1330
01:15:14 --> 01:15:15
AUDIENCE: Montague.
 

1331
01:15:15 --> 01:15:16
PROFESSOR: Montague.
 

1332
01:15:16 --> 01:15:17
That sounds right.
 

1333
01:15:17 --> 01:15:22
OK, Romeo is at who's party?
 

1334
01:15:22 --> 01:15:22
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

1335
01:15:22 --> 01:15:25
PROFESSOR: Do they want
him at this party?

1336
01:15:25 --> 01:15:27
What are they going to
do if they find him?

1337
01:15:27 --> 01:15:27
AUDIENCE: Kill him.
 

1338
01:15:27 --> 01:15:30
PROFESSOR: So how does
that make him feel?

1339
01:15:30 --> 01:15:31
AUDIENCE: Aroused.
 

1340
01:15:31 --> 01:15:35
 
 

1341
01:15:35 --> 01:15:41
PROFESSOR: His little heart
is going pitter pat, right?

1342
01:15:41 --> 01:15:49
There is some sense in which
that contributes to-- that

1343
01:15:49 --> 01:15:52
modulates how attractive you
think somebody else is.

1344
01:15:52 --> 01:15:57
 
 

1345
01:15:57 --> 01:16:00
The clearest pop culture
example of this is ask

1346
01:16:00 --> 01:16:06
yourself about the standard
adventure movie paradigm.

1347
01:16:06 --> 01:16:08
It's got a guy, it's
got a girl, right?

1348
01:16:08 --> 01:16:11
Do they like each other at
the beginning of the movie?

1349
01:16:11 --> 01:16:12
AUDIENCE: No.
 

1350
01:16:12 --> 01:16:14
PROFESSOR: What do they do for
the duration of the movie?

1351
01:16:14 --> 01:16:17
They find themselves in
disasterous situations after

1352
01:16:17 --> 01:16:19
disasterous situation.
 

1353
01:16:19 --> 01:16:20
Do they like each other during?
 

1354
01:16:20 --> 01:16:24
No, no, they spend the whole
movie sniping each other and

1355
01:16:24 --> 01:16:26
double crosssing each other
and stuff like that.

1356
01:16:26 --> 01:16:29
The end of the movie they're
both hanging by one fingernail

1357
01:16:29 --> 01:16:33
from the helicopter over the
volcano or something like that

1358
01:16:33 --> 01:16:35
and what do they realize?
 

1359
01:16:35 --> 01:16:37
We're in love.
 

1360
01:16:37 --> 01:16:38
This is great.
 

1361
01:16:38 --> 01:16:41
 
 

1362
01:16:41 --> 01:16:44
It sounds silly, but the fact
that we have been willing to

1363
01:16:44 --> 01:16:48
tolerate that plot line
forever suggests that

1364
01:16:48 --> 01:16:51
there's something to it.
 

1365
01:16:51 --> 01:16:54
OK, I got enough time to tell
you about what is arguably one

1366
01:16:54 --> 01:16:58
of the great experiments in
experimental psychology.

1367
01:16:58 --> 01:17:00
Did I already tell you about
the shaky bridge experiment?

1368
01:17:00 --> 01:17:00
AUDIENCE: No.
 

1369
01:17:00 --> 01:17:03
PROFESSOR: No, good.
 

1370
01:17:03 --> 01:17:07
This is an experiment so good
that I did a pilgrimage to the

1371
01:17:07 --> 01:17:12
place where it was done, which
turns out to be in Vancouver.

1372
01:17:12 --> 01:17:17
Vancouver has a park with a
deep gorge and a Raiders of

1373
01:17:17 --> 01:17:21
the Lost Ark style suspension
bridge going across it.

1374
01:17:21 --> 01:17:25
Or Shrek, you know with
the donkey going across--

1375
01:17:25 --> 01:17:26
you know the bridge.
 

1376
01:17:26 --> 01:17:28
No volcanoes or dragons
and anything, but

1377
01:17:28 --> 01:17:30
it's a shaky bridge.
 

1378
01:17:30 --> 01:17:32
Here's what they did.
 

1379
01:17:32 --> 01:17:34
You're a guy for
this experiment.

1380
01:17:34 --> 01:17:40
You're a guy and you are
walking across this shaky

1381
01:17:40 --> 01:17:46
bridge and in the middle of
the bridge you meet a woman.

1382
01:17:46 --> 01:17:51
And she says, I'm doing a study
for psychology, would you fill

1383
01:17:51 --> 01:17:54
out my little questionnaire?
 

1384
01:17:54 --> 01:17:57
Well, OK.
 

1385
01:17:57 --> 01:17:59
As part of process says,
there's [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

1386
01:17:59 --> 01:18:03
if you want to know more about
this experiment once we've

1387
01:18:03 --> 01:18:07
collected the data, you
can phone me at this

1388
01:18:07 --> 01:18:08
number at the lab.
 

1389
01:18:08 --> 01:18:11
My name is Sarah.
 

1390
01:18:11 --> 01:18:14
OK, so that's group 1.
 

1391
01:18:14 --> 01:18:17
Group 2 turns out round the
corner from this shaky bridge,

1392
01:18:17 --> 01:18:19
there's another bridge over the
same river, it's a

1393
01:18:19 --> 01:18:21
big concrete slab.
 

1394
01:18:21 --> 01:18:23
It don't shake at all.
 

1395
01:18:23 --> 01:18:25
You're a different white guy.
 

1396
01:18:25 --> 01:18:26
White guy?
 

1397
01:18:26 --> 01:18:27
I don't remember if
you're a white guy.

1398
01:18:27 --> 01:18:28
You're a guy.
 

1399
01:18:28 --> 01:18:32
You're walking across the
bridge and you meet a

1400
01:18:32 --> 01:18:35
woman and same story.
 

1401
01:18:35 --> 01:18:39
If you're interested in the
results of this experiment

1402
01:18:39 --> 01:18:42
phone this number and
ask for Rebecca.

1403
01:18:42 --> 01:18:47
Needless to say, Rebecca and
Sarah are the same person.

1404
01:18:47 --> 01:18:51
The only thing that differs is
whether you met her on the

1405
01:18:51 --> 01:18:54
shaky bridge on the
nonshaky bridge.

1406
01:18:54 --> 01:18:58
That data are, who calls?
 

1407
01:18:58 --> 01:19:02
So your call up the number,
some guy answers, you

1408
01:19:02 --> 01:19:05
say is Rebecca there?
 

1409
01:19:05 --> 01:19:09
And he says, no, no I'll take a
message and hangs up the phone.

1410
01:19:09 --> 01:19:12
Another one for Rebecca.
 

1411
01:19:12 --> 01:19:18
It turns out that more guys who
met Sarah on the shaky bridge

1412
01:19:18 --> 01:19:22
phone in than who met Rebecca
on the solid bridge.

1413
01:19:22 --> 01:19:24
Why is that?
 

1414
01:19:24 --> 01:19:29
The argument-- this arousal
heat argument is, it's

1415
01:19:29 --> 01:19:32
known in the trade as
misattribution of arousal.

1416
01:19:32 --> 01:19:38
You walk across the bridge, you
meet a woman person, you ask

1417
01:19:38 --> 01:19:41
yourself, how do I feel?
 

1418
01:19:41 --> 01:19:43
My heart is beating.
 

1419
01:19:43 --> 01:19:45
My palms are sweaty.
 

1420
01:19:45 --> 01:19:47
It must be love.
 

1421
01:19:47 --> 01:19:49
 
 

1422
01:19:49 --> 01:19:52
And it's enough of an effect to
change whether or not you'll

1423
01:19:52 --> 01:19:57
phone up to get the results
of the experiment.

1424
01:19:57 --> 01:20:01
Look, you shouldn't
overstress the result.

1425
01:20:01 --> 01:20:03
Nobody's done this particular
experiment, but if you meet a

1426
01:20:03 --> 01:20:07
chicken in the middle of the
bridge you don't say,

1427
01:20:07 --> 01:20:08
my heart is beating.
 

1428
01:20:08 --> 01:20:09
My palm's are sweaty.
 

1429
01:20:09 --> 01:20:12
I love the chicken.
 

1430
01:20:12 --> 01:20:14
But it does modulate things.
 

1431
01:20:14 --> 01:20:15
