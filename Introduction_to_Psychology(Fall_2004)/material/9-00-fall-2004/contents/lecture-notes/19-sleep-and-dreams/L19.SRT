7
00:00:15 --> 00:00:23
PROFESSOR: This is the lecture
on sleep and dreams, and you

8
00:00:23 --> 00:00:28
want to know about this because
it's -- well, at MIT, sleep and

9
00:00:28 --> 00:00:31
dreams is a topic that falls
under the heading of

10
00:00:31 --> 00:00:35
abnormal psychology.
 

11
00:00:35 --> 00:00:40
All right, let us ask to begin,
how many people here got

12
00:00:40 --> 00:00:44
some sleep last night?
 

13
00:00:44 --> 00:00:45
OK.
 

14
00:00:45 --> 00:00:51
Of those people, how many
people went to sleep, even

15
00:00:51 --> 00:00:57
though they knew they still had
stuff they wanted to get done?

16
00:00:57 --> 00:00:57
All right.
 

17
00:00:57 --> 00:01:01
So, what's your problem?
 

18
00:01:01 --> 00:01:05
Well, the typical MIT
answer to that is sort

19
00:01:05 --> 00:01:07
of a moral argument.
 

20
00:01:07 --> 00:01:09
I'm weak.
 

21
00:01:09 --> 00:01:13
I'm a miserable human being.
 

22
00:01:13 --> 00:01:18
If I was a good, strong human
being, I would not have gotten

23
00:01:18 --> 00:01:22
sleep, I would have done
that problem set and so on.

24
00:01:22 --> 00:01:28
 
 

25
00:01:28 --> 00:01:37
If you were not at MIT -- MIT
is merely at one extreme here.

26
00:01:37 --> 00:01:42
Western civilization in general
increasingly, since the

27
00:01:42 --> 00:01:47
invention of the lightbulb, has
been an increasingly

28
00:01:47 --> 00:01:53
sleep-abusing,
mechanism-abusing culture.

29
00:01:53 --> 00:01:56
But if you were left to your
own devices or to what nature

30
00:01:56 --> 00:02:00
had intended, you'd be sleeping
about eight hours a night, and

31
00:02:00 --> 00:02:05
you would be doing this across
your life span with the result

32
00:02:05 --> 00:02:10
that you would spend about a
third of your life asleep in

33
00:02:10 --> 00:02:13
this altered state of
consciousness or

34
00:02:13 --> 00:02:13
unconsciousness.
 

35
00:02:13 --> 00:02:16
 
 

36
00:02:16 --> 00:02:21
That, if you're teaching a
course on human behavior and

37
00:02:21 --> 00:02:26
human mental life, that
requires some explanation.

38
00:02:26 --> 00:02:28
Why do people sleep?
 

39
00:02:28 --> 00:02:35
What is the nature of
that behavior left

40
00:02:35 --> 00:02:36
to its normal state?
 

41
00:02:36 --> 00:02:39
What happens when you abuse it?
 

42
00:02:39 --> 00:02:43
Why do people dream, which is
psychologically, perhaps, the

43
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
most interesting
piece of sleep.

44
00:02:46 --> 00:02:50
Is it possible to get any -- do
those dreams, do those weird

45
00:02:50 --> 00:02:52
stories have any meaning?
 

46
00:02:52 --> 00:02:54
Those are the questions
that I'll talk about.

47
00:02:54 --> 00:02:58
I don't know if I'll get to end
of it today, otherwise I'll

48
00:02:58 --> 00:03:02
pick up after Thanksgiving.
 

49
00:03:02 --> 00:03:08
Let's talk initially about
why and how you sleep.

50
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
Well, look, I mean one level of
answer would be you sleep

51
00:03:11 --> 00:03:18
because every so often nuclei,
collections of nerve cells deep

52
00:03:18 --> 00:03:24
down in your brain stem send
volleys of signals up to the

53
00:03:24 --> 00:03:26
rest of your brain that
basically make like a

54
00:03:26 --> 00:03:28
hammer and knock you out.
 

55
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
But that's not a deeply
satisfying answer.

56
00:03:31 --> 00:03:37
It does point to the fact that
it's a very basic drive, and

57
00:03:37 --> 00:03:38
it's a very powerful drive.
 

58
00:03:38 --> 00:03:45
Look, if you wanted to you
could, for example, as a

59
00:03:45 --> 00:03:52
statement of extreme political
conviction, sit right here and

60
00:03:52 --> 00:03:55
starve yourself to death.
 

61
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
Hunger is an important drive.
 

62
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
There are several people
illustrating that at

63
00:03:59 --> 00:04:03
this very moment.
 

64
00:04:03 --> 00:04:08
If you wanted, you could
override that and not eat,

65
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
even to the point of
killing yourself.

66
00:04:11 --> 00:04:16
That's not true, for example,
about your breathing.

67
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
If you wanted to sit here and
hold your breath until you

68
00:04:19 --> 00:04:23
died, it wouldn't work.
 

69
00:04:23 --> 00:04:27
You may have tried this
when you were little.

70
00:04:27 --> 00:04:30
One of my two sisters used
to be a fan of this.

71
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
If we were teasing her and
chasing her she would just hold

72
00:04:33 --> 00:04:38
her breath until she keeled
over, which was very dramatic,

73
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
but not, in fact, life
threatening, except in indirect

74
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44
sense that my mother was not
thrilled with us making my

75
00:04:44 --> 00:04:46
little sister pass out.
 

76
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
 
 

77
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
You could ask her, she'll
be here tomorrow, but

78
00:04:51 --> 00:04:52
you'll all be leaving.
 

79
00:04:52 --> 00:05:03
Anyway, this drive to sleep
is more like the need

80
00:05:03 --> 00:05:06
to breath than the need
to eat in that sense.

81
00:05:06 --> 00:05:10
If you were to sit here and by
an act of will declare I will

82
00:05:10 --> 00:05:14
not fall asleep -- and look, as
you well know, there's a

83
00:05:14 --> 00:05:17
substantial number of you who
can't manage to do that

84
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
for an hour and a half.
 

85
00:05:19 --> 00:05:22
That has to do with how you're
abusing the normal mechanism on

86
00:05:22 --> 00:05:30
-- when I first was teaching, I
used to look out at 10250 full

87
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
of intro psych students
in they're ahh.

88
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
I'm thinking I'm not being
lively enough here.

89
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
I realize at this point, I
could be setting off large

90
00:05:38 --> 00:05:41
explosions on a regular basis
and it wouldn't matter

91
00:05:41 --> 00:05:43
for some people.
 

92
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
We'll get to that in a minute.
 

93
00:05:45 --> 00:05:51
But even those of you who are
well-rested, you could not

94
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
sit here and not sleep.
 

95
00:05:53 --> 00:05:56
Probably you couldn't make
it for twenty-four hours.

96
00:05:56 --> 00:05:59
Absolutely you could not make
it for forty-eight hours

97
00:05:59 --> 00:06:05
without external help, either
from drugs, like caffeine, or

98
00:06:05 --> 00:06:07
more particularly from
somebody smacking you

99
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
around to keep you awake.
 

100
00:06:09 --> 00:06:13
If you're in a sleep lab and
you want to keep somebody awake

101
00:06:13 --> 00:06:20
for thirty-six hours or
something to see what happens,

102
00:06:20 --> 00:06:23
you sure don't say, I'll give
you ten bucks if you can

103
00:06:23 --> 00:06:24
stay awake all night.
 

104
00:06:24 --> 00:06:28
You need somebody there to slap
them around and keep them

105
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
moving or they'll be out.
 

106
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
There's just no way
to suppress that.

107
00:06:33 --> 00:06:37
It's a very, very
powerful drive.

108
00:06:37 --> 00:06:40
So, how come?
 

109
00:06:40 --> 00:06:42
What's doing this?
 

110
00:06:42 --> 00:06:49
Your need to sleep is driven
by two primary factors.

111
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
One of them is a so-called
circadian rhythm.

112
00:06:51 --> 00:06:55
The term comes from --
circadian is about a day,

113
00:06:55 --> 00:06:58
because it's a rhythm with
a periodicity of about

114
00:06:58 --> 00:07:01
twenty-four hours.
 

115
00:07:01 --> 00:07:06
If you manage to measure it in
isolation, and you were to

116
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
measure something like
alertness, it would have a

117
00:07:09 --> 00:07:13
roughly sinusoidal shape to it,
this particular drive.

118
00:07:13 --> 00:07:18
When you wake up, it's actually
at a relative low point.

119
00:07:18 --> 00:07:19
Yeah, right.
 

120
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
At six a.m. on this chart,
is it a relative low point?

121
00:07:23 --> 00:07:29
It rises your alertness driven
by the circadian clock, rises

122
00:07:29 --> 00:07:33
systematically during the
course of the day till early

123
00:07:33 --> 00:07:37
evening, and then declines to a
nadir around four or

124
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
five in the morning.
 

125
00:07:39 --> 00:07:43
When you're trying to stay up
all night, that time in the wee

126
00:07:43 --> 00:07:46
hours of the morning when it's
just really, really tough and

127
00:07:46 --> 00:07:53
you're getting the shakes and
all, is when this circadian

128
00:07:53 --> 00:07:57
clock is crashing, is
hitting its minimum.

129
00:07:57 --> 00:07:58
How do we measure this?
 

130
00:07:58 --> 00:08:00
How do we measure
circadian cycles?

131
00:08:00 --> 00:08:04
Well, if you're a mouse it's
actually relatively easy.

132
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
Stick a mouse in a cage with
one of those little running

133
00:08:06 --> 00:08:12
wheels and put a sensor on the
running wheel, and you'll get

134
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
out a graph that looks like the
graph that I put

135
00:08:15 --> 00:08:16
on the handout.
 

136
00:08:16 --> 00:08:21
Each of the lines on that graph
is one day, so you've got a day

137
00:08:21 --> 00:08:26
here, and the mouse is
doing nothing much.

138
00:08:26 --> 00:08:29
Then at a certain point,
the mouse jumps on the

139
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
wheel and does stuff.
 

140
00:08:31 --> 00:08:36
Now, the convention of the
circadian trade is to

141
00:08:36 --> 00:08:37
double-plot their data.
 

142
00:08:37 --> 00:08:42
So the line is the same
data plotted twice.

143
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
It's just makes it easier to
see trends over the day.

144
00:08:44 --> 00:08:48
So this is inactivity,
activity, same day.

145
00:08:48 --> 00:08:51
 
 

146
00:08:51 --> 00:08:55
This is twenty-four hours.
 

147
00:08:55 --> 00:09:06
You can see that the mouse does
this every day, for day after

148
00:09:06 --> 00:09:10
day, like clockwork, as it
were, because the mouse

149
00:09:10 --> 00:09:12
has this little clock
that's telling it.

150
00:09:12 --> 00:09:18
Now, the point at which the
mouse is firing things up,

151
00:09:18 --> 00:09:24
right about here, is the mouse
was on a twelve hour light/dark

152
00:09:24 --> 00:09:26
schedule, and when the lights
go out, the mouse turns on.

153
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
It's a nocturnal beastie.
 

154
00:09:28 --> 00:09:32
When the lights go out he jumps
on the wheel and goes berserk.

155
00:09:32 --> 00:09:37
Now, what happens halfway down
that graph where there's an

156
00:09:37 --> 00:09:41
arrow pointing at the side of
the data, at that point you

157
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
leave the lights
on continuously.

158
00:09:44 --> 00:09:50
What you discover is the mouse
still behaves in a very

159
00:09:50 --> 00:09:51
systematic fashion.
 

160
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
I'm not going to bother
double-plotting my

161
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
data anymore here.
 

162
00:09:55 --> 00:10:02
But now the period is
starting to drift.

163
00:10:02 --> 00:10:06
The mouse is now doing what's
known as free-running, and this

164
00:10:06 --> 00:10:13
is a way that you can take a
look at the circadian cycle in

165
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
this beastie because he's now
no longer got the light signal

166
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
telling him what time it is.
 

167
00:10:19 --> 00:10:22
What you discover is that it's
advancing by about thirty

168
00:10:22 --> 00:10:28
minutes a day, because the
mouse clock has a period, a

169
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
circadian period of about
twenty-three and a half hours

170
00:10:31 --> 00:10:35
-- not quite twenty-four hours.
 

171
00:10:35 --> 00:10:38
If you were in the same
experiment and you were

172
00:10:38 --> 00:10:42
inclined to run around in a
wheel, the day would actually

173
00:10:42 --> 00:10:46
go this way a little bit,
because the human clock has a

174
00:10:46 --> 00:10:50
period of about twenty-four and
a quarter to twenty-four and a

175
00:10:50 --> 00:10:51
half hours, some variation.
 

176
00:10:51 --> 00:10:55
It's again, around a day.
 

177
00:10:55 --> 00:11:01
It gets synchronized
to the real day by

178
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
light most strongly.
 

179
00:11:03 --> 00:11:06
So you know when it's
morning because that's

180
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
when the sun comes up.
 

181
00:11:08 --> 00:11:11
If you never get outside and
you live in constant light,

182
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
your clock may be drifting
too in something fashion.

183
00:11:14 --> 00:11:18
But given a normal exposure
to light/dark cycles,

184
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
that sets the clock.
 

185
00:11:20 --> 00:11:23
How many people are flying
across time zones to

186
00:11:23 --> 00:11:25
the next few days?
 

187
00:11:25 --> 00:11:29
So you guys are all going to be
jet lagged in some fashion,

188
00:11:29 --> 00:11:33
because your clock is set for
East coast, U.S., you'll

189
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
go someplace else.
 

190
00:11:35 --> 00:11:38
Get outside because it's
exposure to the sun

191
00:11:38 --> 00:11:40
that will reset you.
 

192
00:11:40 --> 00:11:42
Exposure to these sort of
lights will reset you too,

193
00:11:42 --> 00:11:46
but the sun is sufficiently
brighter that it makes

194
00:11:46 --> 00:11:49
a bigger difference.
 

195
00:11:49 --> 00:11:52
This clock, by the
way, has a home.

196
00:11:52 --> 00:12:05
It's located in the
suprachiasmatic nucleus.

197
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
Looks more complicated
than it is.

198
00:12:07 --> 00:12:10
Supra for above.
 

199
00:12:10 --> 00:12:16
Chiasmatic for the optic
chiasm, that x where the optic

200
00:12:16 --> 00:12:21
nerves cross on the way
from the eyes to the brain.

201
00:12:21 --> 00:12:24
This sits right on top
of that and gets direct

202
00:12:24 --> 00:12:25
input from the retina.
 

203
00:12:25 --> 00:12:29
It's got its own visual
system in a sense.

204
00:12:29 --> 00:12:33
How do we know that this
is where the clock lives?

205
00:12:33 --> 00:12:34
There are a number of ways.
 

206
00:12:34 --> 00:12:37
But the coolest way that we
know that this is where the

207
00:12:37 --> 00:12:43
clock lives is that there are
clock mutants out there,

208
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
probably some human, but
certainly mouse mutants.

209
00:12:46 --> 00:12:50
Suppose you got a mouse mutant
who, let's say, has a clock

210
00:12:50 --> 00:12:55
running at, say, twenty-two
hours or something like that.

211
00:12:55 --> 00:12:59
You can go in, take out the
suprachiasmatic nucleus from

212
00:12:59 --> 00:13:04
that mouse, put it into another
mouse -- and this is a case

213
00:13:04 --> 00:13:06
where a brain transplant
will actually work.

214
00:13:06 --> 00:13:11
The recipient mouse will now
start running with the clock

215
00:13:11 --> 00:13:15
timing of the donor mouse.
 

216
00:13:15 --> 00:13:19
If you want a new clock, you
can actually go and get -- I

217
00:13:19 --> 00:13:23
don't know if you go and get
one from a mouse, and probably

218
00:13:23 --> 00:13:24
your neighbor doesn't
want to donate.

219
00:13:24 --> 00:13:28
 
 

220
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
There are also other clocks, by
the way, that live in places

221
00:13:30 --> 00:13:37
like your liver, but the main
clock running your behavior is

222
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
sitting up there in your brain
and reset by light, and in

223
00:13:40 --> 00:13:45
fact, can be transplanted,
apparently.

224
00:13:45 --> 00:13:51
Now, humans don't tend
to run in little mouse

225
00:13:51 --> 00:13:54
wheels very much.
 

226
00:13:54 --> 00:13:59
If you want to measure this in
a human, if you stick a human

227
00:13:59 --> 00:14:06
in continuous light, and cut
them off from the external

228
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
world, which you can get
yourself paid to

229
00:14:08 --> 00:14:09
do if you want.
 

230
00:14:09 --> 00:14:13
One of the leading sleep labs
in the world, actually,

231
00:14:13 --> 00:14:17
is across the river at
Brigham and Women's.

232
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
My lab actually does some
collaborating with them.

233
00:14:20 --> 00:14:22
So if you're interested
talk to me.

234
00:14:22 --> 00:14:23
People do this as a summer job.
 

235
00:14:23 --> 00:14:28
You get locked in the
lab for the summer.

236
00:14:28 --> 00:14:30
People think oh, I'm going to
write the great American novel

237
00:14:30 --> 00:14:34
or something like that while I
stay up all night or something.

238
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
But you get paid a
decent rate for this.

239
00:14:36 --> 00:14:42
 
 

240
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
Now we're going to want to
keep track of what your

241
00:14:44 --> 00:14:47
circadian clock is doing.
 

242
00:14:47 --> 00:14:50
The sorts of things that vary
with your clock are, for

243
00:14:50 --> 00:14:53
example, body temperature.
 

244
00:14:53 --> 00:14:58
Your body temperature has about
a one degree plus and minus

245
00:14:58 --> 00:15:01
swing with the circadian clock.
 

246
00:15:01 --> 00:15:05
So, if you've got a fever, for
example, you'd probably

247
00:15:05 --> 00:15:07
remember from when you were a
little kid that your fever

248
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
would peak in the
early evening.

249
00:15:10 --> 00:15:12
If you stay up all night it's
four in the morning where

250
00:15:12 --> 00:15:14
you suddenly feel chilled.
 

251
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
That's because your body
temperature is actually

252
00:15:16 --> 00:15:19
varying as a function
of the circadian cycle.

253
00:15:19 --> 00:15:23
There are lots of circulating
hormones, like melatonin and

254
00:15:23 --> 00:15:27
others, in the blood that also
track the circadian clock.

255
00:15:27 --> 00:15:32
So, if you're in the lab,
somebody is going to be

256
00:15:32 --> 00:15:36
monitoring these various
aspects of your physiology in

257
00:15:36 --> 00:15:39
an effort to take a look at
where your circadian clock is.

258
00:15:39 --> 00:15:41
This is one of the things that
sort of discourages people from

259
00:15:41 --> 00:15:45
immediately signing up, because
well, for instance, if you're

260
00:15:45 --> 00:15:48
going to be taking continuous
measures of body temperature,

261
00:15:48 --> 00:15:50
the thermometer is not
under your tongue.

262
00:15:50 --> 00:15:54
 
 

263
00:15:54 --> 00:15:59
It's a slow group.
 

264
00:15:59 --> 00:16:10
Anyway, so you got the
circadian clock that's

265
00:16:10 --> 00:16:13
driving your alertness.
 

266
00:16:13 --> 00:16:17
The other piece that's driving
you're alertness, or inversely

267
00:16:17 --> 00:16:23
this powerful drive to sleep,
is sometimes called the

268
00:16:23 --> 00:16:23
sleep homeostatic.
 

269
00:16:23 --> 00:16:26
It's simply a homeostatic
mechanism that says the

270
00:16:26 --> 00:16:31
longer you're awake,
the more tired you get.

271
00:16:31 --> 00:16:34
This is not a huge surprise.
 

272
00:16:34 --> 00:16:35
So we can graph that here.
 

273
00:16:35 --> 00:16:37
So this again, alertness.
 

274
00:16:37 --> 00:16:40
Let's say this is 6:00 a.m.
again, now let's say that you

275
00:16:40 --> 00:16:44
wake up at something like 8:00,
and basically it's a roughly

276
00:16:44 --> 00:16:49
linear function of during the
day you get sleepier and

277
00:16:49 --> 00:16:50
sleepier and sleepier and
sleepier, and sleepier,

278
00:16:50 --> 00:16:51
and sleepier.
 

279
00:16:51 --> 00:16:53
This thing builds up
pressure to sleep.

280
00:16:53 --> 00:16:57
If you now go to sleep at let's
say 11:00, that recovers.

281
00:16:57 --> 00:17:01
It recovers at least initially
rather steeply, and

282
00:17:01 --> 00:17:03
then probably has
 

283
00:17:03 --> 00:17:04
a sort of an exponential tail.
 

284
00:17:04 --> 00:17:09
It's not absolutely clear.
 

285
00:17:09 --> 00:17:15
But if you combine these two,
well, if you were to combine

286
00:17:15 --> 00:17:20
these two in the way that
nature intended, what you get

287
00:17:20 --> 00:17:26
is a sustained period of
-- let's look at the

288
00:17:26 --> 00:17:27
course of the day.
 

289
00:17:27 --> 00:17:33
Suppose you wake up in the
relatively early morning, your

290
00:17:33 --> 00:17:39
circadian clock is relatively
depressed, so it's still

291
00:17:39 --> 00:17:41
feeling kind of sleepy.
 

292
00:17:41 --> 00:17:46
But you're homeostat is fully
refreshed, so you're up here,

293
00:17:46 --> 00:17:49
let's say, in alertness land.
 

294
00:17:49 --> 00:17:53
Now as the homeostat
is going down, the

295
00:17:53 --> 00:17:56
circadian chunk is going up.
 

296
00:17:56 --> 00:17:59
So for a sustained period of
the day, say till early

297
00:17:59 --> 00:18:04
evening, you have roughly
level alertness.

298
00:18:04 --> 00:18:07
Believe it or not, that's what
really happens to people

299
00:18:07 --> 00:18:08
who are well-rested.
 

300
00:18:08 --> 00:18:11
They are awake during the day.
 

301
00:18:11 --> 00:18:13
 
 

302
00:18:13 --> 00:18:24
Some time in early evening when
the circadian clock turns

303
00:18:24 --> 00:18:28
downward, things start going
downhill for you and

304
00:18:28 --> 00:18:32
your alertness starts
steadily dropping.

305
00:18:32 --> 00:18:38
At some point it drops enough
that you -- well, that people

306
00:18:38 --> 00:18:43
who are not abusing the
system -- go to sleep.

307
00:18:43 --> 00:18:47
 
 

308
00:18:47 --> 00:18:52
So now, you're asleep so
you're not terribly alert.

309
00:18:52 --> 00:18:56
So what's happening now is, so
you're down here in asleep land

310
00:18:56 --> 00:19:01
somewhere, now your homeostat
is recovering, right?

311
00:19:01 --> 00:19:05
But in the early portions of
your sleep, or during the

312
00:19:05 --> 00:19:06
course of the night,
this circadian thing is

313
00:19:06 --> 00:19:08
still crashing down.
 

314
00:19:08 --> 00:19:12
So even though you may have
climbed up here already on the

315
00:19:12 --> 00:19:17
homeostat, you're crashing down
to here and the circadian thing

316
00:19:17 --> 00:19:21
is saying stay asleep, stay
asleep, it's good for you.

317
00:19:21 --> 00:19:26
You should be asleep for
this sustained eight hours.

318
00:19:26 --> 00:19:32
Then it turns around in the
early morning hours and

319
00:19:32 --> 00:19:33
4:00, 5:00, 6:00 a.m.
 

320
00:19:33 --> 00:19:36
you wake with the chickens and
you're bright and perky and

321
00:19:36 --> 00:19:40
alert, like you are
every morning.

322
00:19:40 --> 00:19:41
You're back.
 

323
00:19:41 --> 00:19:44
So what you get out of this
system, if it's being allowed

324
00:19:44 --> 00:19:49
to work properly, is a
sustained period of alertness

325
00:19:49 --> 00:19:52
during the day, and the
sustained bout of sleep

326
00:19:52 --> 00:19:53
during the night.
 

327
00:19:53 --> 00:19:59
If you crash the circadian
system, for instance, you

328
00:19:59 --> 00:20:03
end up with broken sleep.
 

329
00:20:03 --> 00:20:10
So, you blow up a mouse's
circadian clock, and what you

330
00:20:10 --> 00:20:13
get is a mouse who runs and
naps, and runs and naps, and

331
00:20:13 --> 00:20:19
runs and naps -- doesn't have
this organized pattern to it.

332
00:20:19 --> 00:20:24
Now, the great tragedy, of
course, is that you guys who

333
00:20:24 --> 00:20:31
are in the peak of your ability
to do this aren't doing it.

334
00:20:31 --> 00:20:34
You're abusing the
pants off it.

335
00:20:34 --> 00:20:38
The structure of sleep
changes over the course

336
00:20:38 --> 00:20:40
of the lifespan.
 

337
00:20:40 --> 00:20:45
Babies sleep for a lot
longer than adults do.

338
00:20:45 --> 00:20:50
After early childhood, people
have a fairly constant

339
00:20:50 --> 00:20:52
requirement for
about eight hours.

340
00:20:52 --> 00:20:55
The range is really about
seven to nine hours.

341
00:20:55 --> 00:21:01
People who say they require
only four hours of sleep or

342
00:21:01 --> 00:21:04
something like that are
basically lying to you.

343
00:21:04 --> 00:21:06
 
 

344
00:21:06 --> 00:21:09
Thomas Edison, right,
he's always trotted out

345
00:21:09 --> 00:21:10
as the example here.
 

346
00:21:10 --> 00:21:12
I don't remember what he
needed, two hours a night,

347
00:21:12 --> 00:21:13
four hours a night.
 

348
00:21:13 --> 00:21:17
Well, there was a reason the
man had a cot in is office.

349
00:21:17 --> 00:21:20
The people who don't sleep
eight hours at night are

350
00:21:20 --> 00:21:22
catching naps when they can and
they're building up a sleep

351
00:21:22 --> 00:21:26
debt the rest of the time.
 

352
00:21:26 --> 00:21:36
The sleep debt is -- if you
are Dement, William Dement,

353
00:21:36 --> 00:21:40
Stanford sleep researcher
coined the term sleep debt, I

354
00:21:40 --> 00:21:43
think, argues that it may be
the biggest health problem

355
00:21:43 --> 00:21:44
in the U.S. Why is that?
 

356
00:21:44 --> 00:21:48
Well because all sorts of stuff
from traffic accidents to

357
00:21:48 --> 00:21:54
industrial accidents and so on,
occur basically in the wee

358
00:21:54 --> 00:21:57
hours of the morning when the
circadian clock is busy

359
00:21:57 --> 00:22:03
crashing, because sleepiness is
not good for behavior, as

360
00:22:03 --> 00:22:07
you may have noticed in
various and sundry ways.

361
00:22:07 --> 00:22:11
When you get older, it turns
out to get harder -- for

362
00:22:11 --> 00:22:13
reasons we don't really
understand -- to maintain this

363
00:22:13 --> 00:22:16
consolidated period of sleep.
 

364
00:22:16 --> 00:22:22
So, it is a sad fact that I,
for instance, do not typically

365
00:22:22 --> 00:22:26
manage to sleep eight hours
solidly, anything like eight

366
00:22:26 --> 00:22:31
hours solidly, at a stretch
anymore, even though I have

367
00:22:31 --> 00:22:35
long ago abandoned my various
efforts to abuse the system.

368
00:22:35 --> 00:22:37
I'd love to sleep a solid
 

369
00:22:37 --> 00:22:39
twelve, seven would
be happy enough.

370
00:22:39 --> 00:22:42
But as you get older it's
harder to maintain it.

371
00:22:42 --> 00:22:44
You can do it now and
you're not doing it.

372
00:22:44 --> 00:22:46
It's so sad.
 

373
00:22:46 --> 00:22:49
So, what are you doing and
why are you so deluded?

374
00:22:49 --> 00:22:54
Well, in part you're being
deluded by this circadian

375
00:22:54 --> 00:22:57
clock, because what happens?
 

376
00:22:57 --> 00:23:00
You stay up all night, right.
 

377
00:23:00 --> 00:23:02
So, where should we plot this?
 

378
00:23:02 --> 00:23:03
What we don't have any colors.
 

379
00:23:03 --> 00:23:08
 
 

380
00:23:08 --> 00:23:12
Let's assume that you were once
well-rested like before you

381
00:23:12 --> 00:23:19
arrived at MIT or something,
and you stay up all night.

382
00:23:19 --> 00:23:21
So you were doing fine
till here and now you're

383
00:23:21 --> 00:23:24
going to stay up.
 

384
00:23:24 --> 00:23:26
I'm getting sleepier here.
 

385
00:23:26 --> 00:23:30
Well, there's the coffee
and the Jolt cola.

386
00:23:30 --> 00:23:34
 
 

387
00:23:34 --> 00:23:36
Who knows what else
smacking you around.

388
00:23:36 --> 00:23:38
Stuff happens.
 

389
00:23:38 --> 00:23:42
But you know, you're fighting
a losing battle here.

390
00:23:42 --> 00:23:46
At 4:00 in the morning and
you're barely holding on, and

391
00:23:46 --> 00:23:49
let me tell you that psych
paper that you're writing at

392
00:23:49 --> 00:23:51
that point is not
your best work.

393
00:23:51 --> 00:23:54
 
 

394
00:23:54 --> 00:23:55
So there goes 4:00
in the morning.

395
00:23:55 --> 00:23:59
But 6:00, 7:00 in the morning,
you've been up all night.

396
00:23:59 --> 00:24:00
What happens?
 

397
00:24:00 --> 00:24:04
The circadian clock
turns around.

398
00:24:04 --> 00:24:11
I did it, I did it, I don't
need your sleep, I'm so good.

399
00:24:11 --> 00:24:13
I'm a real MIT student!
 

400
00:24:13 --> 00:24:19
This is great, but
it's all fake.

401
00:24:19 --> 00:24:21
You think you're getting
back up here, forget it.

402
00:24:21 --> 00:24:22
You're in here somewhere.
 

403
00:24:22 --> 00:24:24
Klunk, like that.
 

404
00:24:24 --> 00:24:27
 
 

405
00:24:27 --> 00:24:31
So you're ambling around
in this business.

406
00:24:31 --> 00:24:37
If you think that this is great
evidence that I'm superman

407
00:24:37 --> 00:24:41
and I don't need to sleep,
try it the second night.

408
00:24:41 --> 00:24:43
I don't know how many of you
have ever tried staying

409
00:24:43 --> 00:24:44
awake two nights.
 

410
00:24:44 --> 00:24:49
The way to stay awake two
nights in a row is to have

411
00:24:49 --> 00:24:53
somebody shooting at you.
 

412
00:24:53 --> 00:24:59
Leading funders of sleep
research are Army and Airforce,

413
00:24:59 --> 00:25:01
and they have a very
particular interest.

414
00:25:01 --> 00:25:04
Their interest is -- well, they
have sort of two interests.

415
00:25:04 --> 00:25:08
One of the army interests is
we're going to take over this

416
00:25:08 --> 00:25:11
country in a hundred hours
straight and our boys ain't

417
00:25:11 --> 00:25:14
going to sleep until it's
done, and we don't want

418
00:25:14 --> 00:25:18
any ill effects of this.
 

419
00:25:18 --> 00:25:21
Got some good drugs for us, we
need drugs, we want good drugs.

420
00:25:21 --> 00:25:23
That's for the Army
research program.

421
00:25:23 --> 00:25:27
The Airforce says, we can fly
at night, this is cool, we've

422
00:25:27 --> 00:25:30
got really cool toys,
we can fly at night.

423
00:25:30 --> 00:25:33
It's really bad when the
helicopter guy falls

424
00:25:33 --> 00:25:39
asleep, so we need him to
stay awake at bad times.

425
00:25:39 --> 00:25:43
So they're big time funders
of this kind of stuff.

426
00:25:43 --> 00:25:49
It is the fact that the sort of
thing -- your general level of

427
00:25:49 --> 00:25:53
arousal will keep you up, and
so the panicked sense that

428
00:25:53 --> 00:25:55
you're going to flunk psych
if you don't finish the

429
00:25:55 --> 00:25:57
paper will do some good.
 

430
00:25:57 --> 00:25:59
The panicked sense that if you
fall asleep somebody's going to

431
00:25:59 --> 00:26:03
shoot you does a lot of good.
 

432
00:26:03 --> 00:26:08
You can stay awake for a
long time under that basis.

433
00:26:08 --> 00:26:12
But it's not that you
miraculously if you just

434
00:26:12 --> 00:26:15
can make it past here
you get back up here.

435
00:26:15 --> 00:26:17
 
 

436
00:26:17 --> 00:26:20
This thing, if you don't
keep recovering, it

437
00:26:20 --> 00:26:21
just keeps going.
 

438
00:26:21 --> 00:26:25
 
 

439
00:26:25 --> 00:26:27
Eventually you're
going to fall asleep.

440
00:26:27 --> 00:26:33
It's just going to
happen to you.

441
00:26:33 --> 00:26:39
So that's the broad sort
of twenty-four hour

442
00:26:39 --> 00:26:41
scale of sleep.
 

443
00:26:41 --> 00:26:48
Within that, there's a
structure on top of that.

444
00:26:48 --> 00:26:55
This is sort of a ninety minute
ripple sitting on top of this

445
00:26:55 --> 00:27:02
circadian clock that runs all
day and while you're asleep.

446
00:27:02 --> 00:27:07
You know this during the day by
the variations -- what would

447
00:27:07 --> 00:27:10
you may have noticed were
reliable fluctuations in your

448
00:27:10 --> 00:27:13
own alertness during the day.
 

449
00:27:13 --> 00:27:18
In fact, you can probably do
this -- I should collect

450
00:27:18 --> 00:27:20
data on this some year.
 

451
00:27:20 --> 00:27:23
I'll have to make up a
little questionnaire.

452
00:27:23 --> 00:27:25
The clock is about ninety
minutes, this lecture's

453
00:27:25 --> 00:27:27
about ninety minutes.
 

454
00:27:27 --> 00:27:34
So sometime during this
lecture, you'll hit the nadir

455
00:27:34 --> 00:27:37
of that ninety minute cycle.
 

456
00:27:37 --> 00:27:41
Actually, I can at least
ask a general question.

457
00:27:41 --> 00:27:45
How many people think they
could identify within plus or

458
00:27:45 --> 00:27:49
minus fifteen minutes the point
during an average intro psych

459
00:27:49 --> 00:27:53
lecture where they're going, if
they're going to lose is, where

460
00:27:53 --> 00:27:54
are they going to lose it?
 

461
00:27:54 --> 00:27:57
 
 

462
00:27:57 --> 00:28:01
Many of us know that
there are just chunks

463
00:28:01 --> 00:28:03
of time that are bad.
 

464
00:28:03 --> 00:28:06
You might notice, if you
check out, if you were to

465
00:28:06 --> 00:28:08
systematically survey those
during the course of the day,

466
00:28:08 --> 00:28:10
of course, it interacts with
things like when you eat your

467
00:28:10 --> 00:28:13
meals, when you get up, whether
you ever got to sleep last

468
00:28:13 --> 00:28:17
night and things like that, but
you may be able to peg a series

469
00:28:17 --> 00:28:20
of these spaced out at ninety
minutes or maybe 180 minutes

470
00:28:20 --> 00:28:24
during the course of the day.
 

471
00:28:24 --> 00:28:26
You see these at night, too.
 

472
00:28:26 --> 00:28:36
 
 

473
00:28:36 --> 00:28:38
To talk about that let's
fill out this cute little

474
00:28:38 --> 00:28:41
chart on the handout.
 

475
00:28:41 --> 00:28:44
 
 

476
00:28:44 --> 00:28:47
If I just stick a bunch of
electrodes on your head and

477
00:28:47 --> 00:28:55
record the electroencephalogram
the mass potentials off of

478
00:28:55 --> 00:29:01
billions of neurons in your
brain, what I will see grossly

479
00:29:01 --> 00:29:06
is high frequency, low
amplitude stuff while

480
00:29:06 --> 00:29:07
you are awake.
 

481
00:29:07 --> 00:29:12
So this is EEG.
 

482
00:29:12 --> 00:29:16
Depending on where I put my
electrode in the brain -- on

483
00:29:16 --> 00:29:18
the scalp, rather, I can get
a lot of other interesting

484
00:29:18 --> 00:29:19
information out of it.
 

485
00:29:19 --> 00:29:21
But for present purposes the
important thing is that the

486
00:29:21 --> 00:29:25
mass activity of the brain is
relatively high frequency,

487
00:29:25 --> 00:29:28
low amplitude stuff.
 

488
00:29:28 --> 00:29:35
If I now take a look at you
when you are deeply asleep,

489
00:29:35 --> 00:29:42
what I will find is low
frequency, high amplitude

490
00:29:42 --> 00:29:52
waves, roughly corresponding to
-- what's going on is in deep

491
00:29:52 --> 00:29:56
sleep, large bodies of neurons
are firing together --

492
00:29:56 --> 00:29:59
everybody's on then
everybody's off.

493
00:29:59 --> 00:30:04
If you're woken up out of that
state, that's the I don't know

494
00:30:04 --> 00:30:08
where I am kind of state.
 

495
00:30:08 --> 00:30:12
You're deeply asleep here.
 

496
00:30:12 --> 00:30:15
The interesting thing,
discovered now about fifty

497
00:30:15 --> 00:30:24
years ago, is that every ninety
minutes or so you'll go into

498
00:30:24 --> 00:30:27
what we will call Rapid Eye
Movement sleep for reasons that

499
00:30:27 --> 00:30:31
will be apparently in the next
line of this table, where all

500
00:30:31 --> 00:30:37
of a sudden the brain goes back
to this high frequency, low

501
00:30:37 --> 00:30:41
amplitude kind of signal.
 

502
00:30:41 --> 00:30:44
Now, research over the course
of the fifty years makes it

503
00:30:44 --> 00:30:47
clear this is not exactly
the same as this, but it

504
00:30:47 --> 00:30:50
certainly looks awake-like.
 

505
00:30:50 --> 00:30:52
So the person is still
clearly asleep.

506
00:30:52 --> 00:30:55
The interesting thing is if you
wake somebody up out of this

507
00:30:55 --> 00:30:58
state, they will reliably
report that they are dreaming.

508
00:30:58 --> 00:31:00
Not all the time.
 

509
00:31:00 --> 00:31:02
If you wake people up out
of this state, they will

510
00:31:02 --> 00:31:05
reliably report that
they are not dreaming.

511
00:31:05 --> 00:31:07
Again, not all the time.
 

512
00:31:07 --> 00:31:09
It's not a perfect divide.
 

513
00:31:09 --> 00:31:12
But lots of narrative
dreaming here.

514
00:31:12 --> 00:31:15
Here you tend to get if you
wake people up and say what was

515
00:31:15 --> 00:31:19
going on, you might get an
isolated thought or some idea

516
00:31:19 --> 00:31:22
that was rattling around, but
you won't get that I was flying

517
00:31:22 --> 00:31:25
naked through the infinite
corridor with a panda on

518
00:31:25 --> 00:31:27
my back or something.
 

519
00:31:27 --> 00:31:29
We'll talk about that later.
 

520
00:31:29 --> 00:31:34
 
 

521
00:31:34 --> 00:31:42
This is the nighttime
manifestation of that ninety

522
00:31:42 --> 00:31:46
minute cycle that you also
see running during the

523
00:31:46 --> 00:31:47
course of the day.
 

524
00:31:47 --> 00:31:50
You can pick that up in the
movements of the eyes, too.

525
00:31:50 --> 00:31:52
That's the electro-oculogram.
 

526
00:31:52 --> 00:32:03
While you are awake, your eyes
move ballistically to the

527
00:32:03 --> 00:32:05
left and to the right.
 

528
00:32:05 --> 00:32:09
Your eyes are sitting in one
place then jumping someplace

529
00:32:09 --> 00:32:11
else and moving around like so.
 

530
00:32:11 --> 00:32:14
The two eyes are moving
together, so-called

531
00:32:14 --> 00:32:17
consensual eye movement.
 

532
00:32:17 --> 00:32:23
In deep sleep, those ballistic
movements, called saccades,

533
00:32:23 --> 00:32:28
disappear and the consensual
movements are damped down to so

534
00:32:28 --> 00:32:33
the eyes are kind of rolling
around in your head and they're

535
00:32:33 --> 00:32:35
not necessarily rolling
in that same place.

536
00:32:35 --> 00:32:38
 
 

537
00:32:38 --> 00:32:42
When you go into Rapid Eye
Movement sleep, the reason it

538
00:32:42 --> 00:32:44
was called Rapid Eye Movement
sleep, it's the eyes look

539
00:32:44 --> 00:32:46
like they're awake again.
 

540
00:32:46 --> 00:32:54
So again, ballistically jumping
around and jumping together.

541
00:32:54 --> 00:32:58
Is the pattern of eye movements
related to what's going

542
00:32:58 --> 00:33:00
on in your dream?
 

543
00:33:00 --> 00:33:02
Well, there's anecdotal
evidence for it, but if you

544
00:33:02 --> 00:33:05
think about it it's very
difficult to do the experiment

545
00:33:05 --> 00:33:08
in any terribly meaningful --
actually there's some

546
00:33:08 --> 00:33:13
interesting data in
animals at this point.

547
00:33:13 --> 00:33:17
In any case, the eyes look
like they're awake here.

548
00:33:17 --> 00:33:20
The eyes, they're doing the
same thing that they were

549
00:33:20 --> 00:33:22
doing when they were awake.
 

550
00:33:22 --> 00:33:28
You can see this in your
roommate, particularly

551
00:33:28 --> 00:33:32
if your roommate has
relatively thin lids.

552
00:33:32 --> 00:33:36
You can often see the eyes
moving around under the lids,

553
00:33:36 --> 00:33:40
and if you watch your sleeping
roommate, your sleeping

554
00:33:40 --> 00:33:43
roommate may think you're a
weirdo when he or she wakes up.

555
00:33:43 --> 00:33:46
But you can actually
see the eyes jerking

556
00:33:46 --> 00:33:50
around under the lids.
 

557
00:33:50 --> 00:33:54
 
 

558
00:33:54 --> 00:33:58
If you have an unusual roommate
who sleeps with the eyes open

559
00:33:58 --> 00:34:01
-- this actually happens.
 

560
00:34:01 --> 00:34:05
The reason for sleeping with
your eyes closed has less to

561
00:34:05 --> 00:34:08
do with -- it presumably has
something to do with cutting

562
00:34:08 --> 00:34:11
the light out, but it had
mostly to do with keeping the

563
00:34:11 --> 00:34:15
cornea hydrated, keeping it
moist while you're asleep.

564
00:34:15 --> 00:34:19
If you sleep with your eyes
open, you wake up with nasty,

565
00:34:19 --> 00:34:21
scratchy, itchy eyeballs.
 

566
00:34:21 --> 00:34:23
Because if you think about
it, you don't sleep

567
00:34:23 --> 00:34:25
with your ears closed.
 

568
00:34:25 --> 00:34:29
It's perfectly possible to use
your brain in some fashion to

569
00:34:29 --> 00:34:33
shut off enough of the ambient
outside stimulus to go

570
00:34:33 --> 00:34:36
to sleep to get rid of
the auditory stimulus.

571
00:34:36 --> 00:34:39
So, in principle, you can do
that with your eyes too.

572
00:34:39 --> 00:34:42
But you close your eyes to
keep them nice and moist.

573
00:34:42 --> 00:34:44
So some people that doesn't
work terribly -- I traveled

574
00:34:44 --> 00:34:51
across France in a train with a
guy who fell asleep but his

575
00:34:51 --> 00:34:55
eyes were open, and it's like
traveling across France

576
00:34:55 --> 00:34:58
with the undead.
 

577
00:34:58 --> 00:35:02
Because at some point he went
into REM sleep and his eyes

578
00:35:02 --> 00:35:06
were going all over the place,
but he ain't looking at

579
00:35:06 --> 00:35:09
nothing that's there.
 

580
00:35:09 --> 00:35:12
It was a little strange.
 

581
00:35:12 --> 00:35:17
So, so far, awake and dreaming
sleep look the same.

582
00:35:17 --> 00:35:21
 
 

583
00:35:21 --> 00:35:24
If you think you're having
trouble telling whether your

584
00:35:24 --> 00:35:27
roommate's actually asleep,
here's how you can tell.

585
00:35:27 --> 00:35:32
You measure muscle
tone, electromyogram.

586
00:35:32 --> 00:35:36
When you are awake, your
muscles are on, right.

587
00:35:36 --> 00:35:36
You have good muscle tone.
 

588
00:35:36 --> 00:35:39
That's why your head doesn't
fall off of your shoulders

589
00:35:39 --> 00:35:43
and I can stand upright
and stuff like that.

590
00:35:43 --> 00:35:49
When you are in deep
sleep, actually your

591
00:35:49 --> 00:35:51
muscles remain on.
 

592
00:35:51 --> 00:35:52
The muscle tone remains high.
 

593
00:35:52 --> 00:35:58
It's when you go into REM sleep
that you lose muscle tone.

594
00:35:58 --> 00:36:04
You can see this in your
friendly neighborhood cat,

595
00:36:04 --> 00:36:08
because all this stuff shows up
widely in mammalian species.

596
00:36:08 --> 00:36:12
So, your cat who's sleeping
like this, that's a deeply

597
00:36:12 --> 00:36:16
sleeping cat whose muscle tone
is doing just fine, thank you.

598
00:36:16 --> 00:36:20
Your cat who's sleeping like
that is a cat who is in REM

599
00:36:20 --> 00:36:26
sleep and has lost muscle tone.
 

600
00:36:26 --> 00:36:32
Now, why would you turn the
muscles off in REM sleep?

601
00:36:32 --> 00:36:35
 
 

602
00:36:35 --> 00:36:36
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].
 

603
00:36:36 --> 00:36:44
 
 

604
00:36:44 --> 00:36:44
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
 

605
00:36:44 --> 00:36:48
If you're busy being Superman
and leaping tall buildings in a

606
00:36:48 --> 00:36:51
single bound in your dreams,
it's a really good idea if you

607
00:36:51 --> 00:36:56
don't actually try that out.
 

608
00:36:56 --> 00:37:00
Not only are you protecting
yourself, you're protecting

609
00:37:00 --> 00:37:03
anybody else you happen
to be sleeping with.

610
00:37:03 --> 00:37:10
A known sleep disorder in older
men is that this blockade of

611
00:37:10 --> 00:37:16
voluntary muscles fades off,
and the result -- and this is a

612
00:37:16 --> 00:37:20
known disorder because older
women bring the older men to

613
00:37:20 --> 00:37:24
the doctor, because their
husband is thrashing around in

614
00:37:24 --> 00:37:28
the middle of the night
and whacking her.

615
00:37:28 --> 00:37:31
This is a real problem,
people get hurt.

616
00:37:31 --> 00:37:35
So, you want the
muscles to go off.

617
00:37:35 --> 00:37:36
There are a number of
corollaries here.

618
00:37:36 --> 00:37:43
It turns out that sleep walking
-- Shakespeare has it wrong.

619
00:37:43 --> 00:37:47
Lady Macbeth is clearly
dreaming about having murdered

620
00:37:47 --> 00:37:50
Duncan and all that when
she's sleep walking.

621
00:37:50 --> 00:37:54
Typically, sleep walking is
not acting out your dreams.

622
00:37:54 --> 00:38:01
It is a version of non-REM
sleep, and it's much more

623
00:38:01 --> 00:38:04
typical in children
than in adults.

624
00:38:04 --> 00:38:06
How many of you know that
used to walk around at

625
00:38:06 --> 00:38:09
night when you were--?
 

626
00:38:09 --> 00:38:12
Little kids wandering around,
their eyes are open,

627
00:38:12 --> 00:38:15
but nobody's home here.
 

628
00:38:15 --> 00:38:20
 
 

629
00:38:20 --> 00:38:22
I don't actually know
that much about it.

630
00:38:22 --> 00:38:27
My theory is that part of
what's doing this is it's your

631
00:38:27 --> 00:38:32
bladder telling you to get up
and the rest of your brain's

632
00:38:32 --> 00:38:34
saying we want to
stay asleep here.

633
00:38:34 --> 00:38:37
My theory is based on one
of the great moments of

634
00:38:37 --> 00:38:44
child-rearing in my household,
which was one of my children.

635
00:38:44 --> 00:38:48
We were awakened in the middle
of the night, my wife and I, by

636
00:38:48 --> 00:38:56
one of my son's yelling "No,
not here!" to the other son

637
00:38:56 --> 00:39:00
who was about to use a trash
can for the wrong purpose.

638
00:39:00 --> 00:39:07
 
 

639
00:39:07 --> 00:39:09
Anyway, it all worked
out in the end.

640
00:39:09 --> 00:39:11
 
 

641
00:39:11 --> 00:39:14
But this is a deep
sleep phenomenon.

642
00:39:14 --> 00:39:24
Talking in your sleep is often,
apparently, talking out of --

643
00:39:24 --> 00:39:30
you're not going to hurt
yourself too much if you don't

644
00:39:30 --> 00:39:35
blockade your jaw, right?
 

645
00:39:35 --> 00:39:39
It's the main body muscles
that are the real threat.

646
00:39:39 --> 00:39:43
So sometimes people will end up
talking in their sleep, often

647
00:39:43 --> 00:39:50
to the amusement of other
people in the room, or to the

648
00:39:50 --> 00:39:54
inconvenience of other people,
or of your own relationships,

649
00:39:54 --> 00:39:58
if what you're talking about is
somebody else other than the

650
00:39:58 --> 00:40:01
person who's currently
present with you.

651
00:40:01 --> 00:40:05
Anyway, it's not clear -- when
we get to meaning of dreams

652
00:40:05 --> 00:40:06
we can talk about this.
 

653
00:40:06 --> 00:40:13
Anyway, so this is the sort
of within the circadian

654
00:40:13 --> 00:40:19
cycle, this is the sort of
structure you get in sleep.

655
00:40:19 --> 00:40:22
 
 

656
00:40:22 --> 00:40:26
Oh, now there's much more to
this than what I'm telling you.

657
00:40:26 --> 00:40:31
Deep sleep can be subdivided
into multiple stages that

658
00:40:31 --> 00:40:33
differ in the activity
of different parts of

659
00:40:33 --> 00:40:37
your brain and so on.
 

660
00:40:37 --> 00:40:41
 
 

661
00:40:41 --> 00:40:46
So now between that twenty-four
hour cycle and this ninety

662
00:40:46 --> 00:40:50
minute cycle, there is yet
another level of structure to a

663
00:40:50 --> 00:40:56
night's sleep where there's
more non-REM, slow wave, deep

664
00:40:56 --> 00:40:58
sleep early in the night.
 

665
00:40:58 --> 00:41:02
If you have a consolidated bout
of eight hours of sleep, a

666
00:41:02 --> 00:41:06
normal night's sleep, what you
will see is more of this stuff

667
00:41:06 --> 00:41:11
early in the night and more of
this stuff later in the night.

668
00:41:11 --> 00:41:14
This is accompanied by
systematic changes in the

669
00:41:14 --> 00:41:19
neurochemistry of the
sleeping brain and so on.

670
00:41:19 --> 00:41:23
There's an intermediate level
of structure to sleep also.

671
00:41:23 --> 00:41:30
The impression one gets is of a
beautifully structured system

672
00:41:30 --> 00:41:35
that is designed
to do something.

673
00:41:35 --> 00:41:40
So, I mean apart from the
obvious, it's designed to keep

674
00:41:40 --> 00:41:44
you from feeling sleepy.
 

675
00:41:44 --> 00:41:52
One wants to know, well,
what is sleep for?

676
00:41:52 --> 00:41:56
You'd be surprised if a third
of your life is spent in this

677
00:41:56 --> 00:41:58
state for no good reason.
 

678
00:41:58 --> 00:42:04
Oh, look at that, it says
Part Two: Why do we sleep?

679
00:42:04 --> 00:42:08
It suggests that there are
several possible reasons here.

680
00:42:08 --> 00:42:11
Anybody care to offer
any possible series

681
00:42:11 --> 00:42:13
of why we sleep?
 

682
00:42:13 --> 00:42:17
 
 

683
00:42:17 --> 00:42:18
Nobody's got a clue.
 

684
00:42:18 --> 00:42:20
Yes?
 

685
00:42:20 --> 00:42:28
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
 

686
00:42:28 --> 00:42:31
PROFESSOR: So there's a
sort of a basic rest and

687
00:42:31 --> 00:42:33
regeneration notion.
 

688
00:42:33 --> 00:42:37
That you use your muscles all
day, it builds up all those

689
00:42:37 --> 00:42:41
metabolic byproducts in muscles
that you learned about

690
00:42:41 --> 00:42:42
once upon a time.
 

691
00:42:42 --> 00:42:47
Sleep/rest will give you a
chance to clear that out.

692
00:42:47 --> 00:42:50
So certainly, one possibility
is it's an enforced

693
00:42:50 --> 00:42:50
rest period.
 

694
00:42:50 --> 00:42:54
You could enforce rest some
other way, presumably.

695
00:42:54 --> 00:42:58
Well, it could be good for
you to rest, period -- just

696
00:42:58 --> 00:42:59
lie around and do nothing.
 

697
00:42:59 --> 00:43:02
But sleep kind of
enforces that.

698
00:43:02 --> 00:43:03
Yes, there was a hand
over there somewhere.

699
00:43:03 --> 00:43:07
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
 

700
00:43:07 --> 00:43:10
PROFESSOR: So, there's a whole
class of theories, and these

701
00:43:10 --> 00:43:15
are actually the ones where
there's, I suppose, the most

702
00:43:15 --> 00:43:18
current interest that has to
do with learning and memory.

703
00:43:18 --> 00:43:25
That somehow what sleep is
about is tuning up your

704
00:43:25 --> 00:43:29
memories and you're
consolidating memories,

705
00:43:29 --> 00:43:32
improving learning or
something like that.

706
00:43:32 --> 00:43:33
Let's talk more about
that in a minute.

707
00:43:33 --> 00:43:36
But if you're sitting there
saying, I'm a real MIT student,

708
00:43:36 --> 00:43:37
I don't need to sleep.
 

709
00:43:37 --> 00:43:41
You might worry about theories
that say sleep is vital to

710
00:43:41 --> 00:43:44
the consolidation of memory.
 

711
00:43:44 --> 00:43:44
Yeah?
 

712
00:43:44 --> 00:43:45
AUDIENCE: It's
 

713
00:43:45 --> 00:43:48
a lot easier to rest during
the day so we don't need

714
00:43:48 --> 00:43:50
to waste all the energy
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

715
00:43:50 --> 00:43:52
PROFESSOR: So another
possibility is energy

716
00:43:52 --> 00:43:55
conservation.
 

717
00:43:55 --> 00:44:02
You could be awake all of the
time, but if you can't hunt

718
00:44:02 --> 00:44:11
when it's dark, you might as
well go and power down the disk

719
00:44:11 --> 00:44:16
drive or something like that
and not use as much energy.

720
00:44:16 --> 00:44:19
Your brain's pretty active
while you're asleep, as you may

721
00:44:19 --> 00:44:21
gather from this, but the rest
of you, of course, is

722
00:44:21 --> 00:44:23
getting some rest.
 

723
00:44:23 --> 00:44:25
Anything else?
 

724
00:44:25 --> 00:44:28
Any other good possibilities?
 

725
00:44:28 --> 00:44:38
Along with that energy saving
one -- we can motivate this one

726
00:44:38 --> 00:44:42
related to energy saving by
asking where do you sleep

727
00:44:42 --> 00:44:43
when it gets dark?
 

728
00:44:43 --> 00:44:46
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
 

729
00:44:46 --> 00:44:47
PROFESSOR: In bed.
 

730
00:44:47 --> 00:44:47
That's seems like a good place.
 

731
00:44:47 --> 00:44:49
Where did you put your bed?
 

732
00:44:49 --> 00:44:55
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
 

733
00:44:55 --> 00:45:00
PROFESSOR: Anybody big on
sleeping on, like putting their

734
00:45:00 --> 00:45:02
bed out on the sidewalk?
 

735
00:45:02 --> 00:45:06
Those of you who are
hunter/gatherers, when you're

736
00:45:06 --> 00:45:10
tired you just lie down in the
middle of the field?

737
00:45:10 --> 00:45:11
No.
 

738
00:45:11 --> 00:45:14
Because it's not
really very safe.

739
00:45:14 --> 00:45:21
So another possibility is that
you want to sleep for purposes

740
00:45:21 --> 00:45:27
of protecting yourself at times
that are-- as a corollary of

741
00:45:27 --> 00:45:29
this you can't hunt
all day thing.

742
00:45:29 --> 00:45:33
There are other things out
there that have adapted

743
00:45:33 --> 00:45:36
themselves to the niche
that you are not in.

744
00:45:36 --> 00:45:39
Like take hunt at night, so if
you're not going to hunt at

745
00:45:39 --> 00:45:43
night, not only do you want to
be calm and quiet, you want to

746
00:45:43 --> 00:45:47
be out of the way, because
otherwise oh, look, he's

747
00:45:47 --> 00:45:50
asleep, let's eat him.
 

748
00:45:50 --> 00:45:52
So there's a sort of a
safety aspect to it.

749
00:45:52 --> 00:45:54
The other part of the safety
aspect is that not only don't

750
00:45:54 --> 00:45:57
you want to hunt at night, if
you just go down wandering

751
00:45:57 --> 00:45:58
around aimlessly at night,
you're going to falli in a

752
00:45:58 --> 00:45:59
hole and hurt yourself.
 

753
00:45:59 --> 00:46:04
So, you've got to get in the
hole first and go to sleep.

754
00:46:04 --> 00:46:06
Do I have any other brilliant
theories here that I

755
00:46:06 --> 00:46:07
wanted to mention?
 

756
00:46:07 --> 00:46:08
That's pretty good.
 

757
00:46:08 --> 00:46:14
You guys managed to do a quick
survey of the leading theories.

758
00:46:14 --> 00:46:21
As I say, a lot of the cool,
current data centers around

759
00:46:21 --> 00:46:25
this idea of sleep having
a role in learning.

760
00:46:25 --> 00:46:28
 
 

761
00:46:28 --> 00:46:30
Let me tell you a
little bit about that.

762
00:46:30 --> 00:46:34
The picture that's on the
handout is an illustration

763
00:46:34 --> 00:46:40
of what looks like a
really trivial task.

764
00:46:40 --> 00:46:45
The question is, is there a
little vertical region in

765
00:46:45 --> 00:46:47
that display somewhere?
 

766
00:46:47 --> 00:46:51
The answer is well, yeah.
 

767
00:46:51 --> 00:46:59
Now I can make that task
arbitrarily difficult by

768
00:46:59 --> 00:47:02
flashing the stimulus very
briefly and following it

769
00:47:02 --> 00:47:04
with a mask of some sort.
 

770
00:47:04 --> 00:47:08
So I can make it hard.
 

771
00:47:08 --> 00:47:11
I can make it as
hard as I like.

772
00:47:11 --> 00:47:22
If I do that, what I can
do is measure, let's call

773
00:47:22 --> 00:47:29
it a threshold time.
 

774
00:47:29 --> 00:47:34
So maybe in order for you to
get this task correct 70% of

775
00:47:34 --> 00:47:37
the time, I initially need
to have the stimulus on

776
00:47:37 --> 00:47:38
for 200 milliseconds.
 

777
00:47:38 --> 00:47:41
 
 

778
00:47:41 --> 00:47:51
If you practice it for a while,
you'll get better and that'll

779
00:47:51 --> 00:47:53
level off at some point.
 

780
00:47:53 --> 00:47:57
What a number of people
have -- well, is it

781
00:47:57 --> 00:47:58
Carney and Sagi I think?
 

782
00:47:58 --> 00:48:02
Doug Sagi is the guy I know.
 

783
00:48:02 --> 00:48:04
What a number of people found,
starting I think with Carney

784
00:48:04 --> 00:48:12
and Sagi, is that if you let
people sleep, in particular if

785
00:48:12 --> 00:48:17
they are allowed to have REM
sleep, that performance gets --

786
00:48:17 --> 00:48:19
well, here's let's have him
sleep for eight hours here.

787
00:48:19 --> 00:48:22
 
 

788
00:48:22 --> 00:48:28
That performance gets better,
as if something happened

789
00:48:28 --> 00:48:29
while they were asleep.
 

790
00:48:29 --> 00:48:33
If they don't sleep during this
period they don't get better.

791
00:48:33 --> 00:48:37
So it's a sleep dependent
improvement in behavior.

792
00:48:37 --> 00:48:41
This is a very specific
little bit of learning.

793
00:48:41 --> 00:48:43
This isn't just a general
overall improvement

794
00:48:43 --> 00:48:45
in behavior.
 

795
00:48:45 --> 00:48:45
If
 

796
00:48:45 --> 00:48:49
you trained people with that
little vertical task, that

797
00:48:49 --> 00:48:52
you're doing a task, is that
region vertical or

798
00:48:52 --> 00:48:53
horizontal, right.
 

799
00:48:53 --> 00:48:54
That the three thing is
vertical or the three thing is

800
00:48:54 --> 00:48:58
horizontal right It's always
I'm looking here and it's

801
00:48:58 --> 00:49:00
always down and to my left.
 

802
00:49:00 --> 00:49:04
I learn to be faster here.
 

803
00:49:04 --> 00:49:07
I don't learn to
be faster here.

804
00:49:07 --> 00:49:11
The improvement in learning is
specific to the little piece of

805
00:49:11 --> 00:49:14
retina that I have trained.
 

806
00:49:14 --> 00:49:20
So it's very specific sort of
learning that seems to be

807
00:49:20 --> 00:49:25
dependent on getting a
decent night's sleep.

808
00:49:25 --> 00:49:31
Now, interestingly, there
is evidence -- how many

809
00:49:31 --> 00:49:32
people here are nappers?
 

810
00:49:32 --> 00:49:35
 
 

811
00:49:35 --> 00:49:38
How many people are nappers
just because it happens?

812
00:49:38 --> 00:49:42
 
 

813
00:49:42 --> 00:49:43
We can do it this way.
 

814
00:49:43 --> 00:49:47
How many people here think that
if they take a nap in the

815
00:49:47 --> 00:49:50
middle of the day, they wake up
feeling better for

816
00:49:50 --> 00:49:52
the experience?
 

817
00:49:52 --> 00:49:57
How many people think if they
have a nap they wake up feeling

818
00:49:57 --> 00:49:59
cruddy for the rest of the day?
 

819
00:49:59 --> 00:50:02
 
 

820
00:50:02 --> 00:50:06
There are people who find naps
to be refreshing and useful,

821
00:50:06 --> 00:50:09
and there are people who
find it being disruptive.

822
00:50:09 --> 00:50:13
It was certainly a big
improvement in my professional

823
00:50:13 --> 00:50:15
life when I reached the
level where I had an

824
00:50:15 --> 00:50:18
office of my own.
 

825
00:50:18 --> 00:50:21
The biggest part of that was
it made napping a great

826
00:50:21 --> 00:50:24
deal more graceful.
 

827
00:50:24 --> 00:50:30
After lunch I could take the
latest issue of Vision Research

828
00:50:30 --> 00:50:34
and prop it up and stare at the
same two sentences for like

829
00:50:34 --> 00:50:37
fifteen minutes and I feel
much better thereafter.

830
00:50:37 --> 00:50:41
 
 

831
00:50:41 --> 00:50:47
There is evidence that a
properly timed nap is just

832
00:50:47 --> 00:50:51
about as good as a night's
sleep for this sort of

833
00:50:51 --> 00:50:52
perceptual learning.
 

834
00:50:52 --> 00:50:54
This is work done by Sara
Mednick originally,

835
00:50:54 --> 00:50:58
up at Harvard.
 

836
00:50:58 --> 00:50:59
This is new stuff.
 

837
00:50:59 --> 00:51:04
We don't really quite
understand fully how

838
00:51:04 --> 00:51:05
far we can take this.
 

839
00:51:05 --> 00:51:10
It's the sort of thing that
your average MIT student is

840
00:51:10 --> 00:51:13
tempted to take and
run with, right.

841
00:51:13 --> 00:51:17
Oh man, I can get the whole
benefit of eight hours of sleep

842
00:51:17 --> 00:51:22
if I just go for -- I think
it's ninety minutes between

843
00:51:22 --> 00:51:24
like 2:00 or 3:00
in the afternoon.

844
00:51:24 --> 00:51:25
That works.
 

845
00:51:25 --> 00:51:26
Great.
 

846
00:51:26 --> 00:51:28
Now I can stay up all night.
 

847
00:51:28 --> 00:51:30
Anyway, we don't know that yet.
 

848
00:51:30 --> 00:51:34
But Mednick's study is an
interesting suggestion that

849
00:51:34 --> 00:51:39
sleep during-- napping sleep
can serve as a same sort of

850
00:51:39 --> 00:51:42
perceptual learning
kind of role.

851
00:51:42 --> 00:51:50
But look, one might actually
wonder whether anybody other

852
00:51:50 --> 00:51:55
than vision researchers cares
about whether or not you can

853
00:51:55 --> 00:51:59
find little briefly flashed
lines in one corner of

854
00:51:59 --> 00:52:00
your visual field.
 

855
00:52:00 --> 00:52:03
That's not what you want to
know about learning and memory.

856
00:52:03 --> 00:52:06
What you want to know is is
anything really useful

857
00:52:06 --> 00:52:08
happening while you're asleep.
 

858
00:52:08 --> 00:52:12
In particular, one of the
things that people want to

859
00:52:12 --> 00:52:18
know is, can you do serious
thinking in your sleep?

860
00:52:18 --> 00:52:25
One thing you can't do
is study in your sleep.

861
00:52:25 --> 00:52:29
There have been endless efforts
because people smelled money at

862
00:52:29 --> 00:52:33
the far end of this to produce
like tapes that you could

863
00:52:33 --> 00:52:36
stick under the pillow.
 

864
00:52:36 --> 00:52:41
Record Gleitman and why
waste precious waking

865
00:52:41 --> 00:52:43
hours reading Gleitman?
 

866
00:52:43 --> 00:52:47
I'll just have somebody else
read it to me while I'm asleep.

867
00:52:47 --> 00:52:51
Sorry, the overwhelming
evidence is that

868
00:52:51 --> 00:52:53
nothing happens.
 

869
00:52:53 --> 00:52:59
The mild effects that are
sporadically shown here come

870
00:52:59 --> 00:53:02
from periodic awakenings
during the night.

871
00:53:02 --> 00:53:06
That also goes for sleeping
through the lecture.

872
00:53:06 --> 00:53:08
If you're sound asleep during
the lecture it's lovely that

873
00:53:08 --> 00:53:12
you were here, but you'll
have to ask somebody else

874
00:53:12 --> 00:53:15
what actually happened.
 

875
00:53:15 --> 00:53:16
So that doesn't work.
 

876
00:53:16 --> 00:53:22
But can you have insights, or
can you do your problem sets

877
00:53:22 --> 00:53:26
during your sleep
in some sense?

878
00:53:26 --> 00:53:29
How many people have had the
experience of being sort of

879
00:53:29 --> 00:53:35
dead-ended on a problem, it's
time to just give it up, you go

880
00:53:35 --> 00:53:38
to sleep and you wake up and
somehow the answer kind

881
00:53:38 --> 00:53:40
of seems to be there?
 

882
00:53:40 --> 00:53:44
It's a not uncommon experienc
and there are lots of anecdotes

883
00:53:44 --> 00:53:46
in the literature about this.
 

884
00:53:46 --> 00:53:52
One of the famous ones is the
guy who first described the

885
00:53:52 --> 00:53:56
ring structure of benzene,
claims that he had a dream of a

886
00:53:56 --> 00:53:59
snake biting his tail and he
woke up knowing that benzene

887
00:53:59 --> 00:54:01
was a ring or something.
 

888
00:54:01 --> 00:54:02
It doesn't always
work, by the way.

889
00:54:02 --> 00:54:10
My father spent his career
as a physicist and had

890
00:54:10 --> 00:54:11
the same experience.
 

891
00:54:11 --> 00:54:14
He's working on a problem,
not getting anywhere.

892
00:54:14 --> 00:54:17
Goes to sleep, wakes up in the
middle of the night, he knows

893
00:54:17 --> 00:54:22
the answer, and he knows you
don't remember stuff from the

894
00:54:22 --> 00:54:24
middle of the night, so he
writes it down fast and

895
00:54:24 --> 00:54:26
goes back to sleep.
 

896
00:54:26 --> 00:54:29
Gets up the next morning as
predicted, has no recollection

897
00:54:29 --> 00:54:32
of what the great answer was,
but he doesn't remember writing

898
00:54:32 --> 00:54:34
it down, which is good.
 

899
00:54:34 --> 00:54:37
So he looks at it and he sees
that the answer is, "All the

900
00:54:37 --> 00:54:46
world is fused with the smell
of cinnamon," which I'm sure

901
00:54:46 --> 00:54:51
was an answer, but was it
necessarily the answer

902
00:54:51 --> 00:54:54
he was looking for.
 

903
00:54:54 --> 00:55:00
So this notion that you could
actually be doing something

904
00:55:00 --> 00:55:07
productive in that sense during
sleep was really in the realm

905
00:55:07 --> 00:55:12
of anecdote until this year.
 

906
00:55:12 --> 00:55:17
I put the reference on the
paper by this group in Germany

907
00:55:17 --> 00:55:19
led by -- I suppose since he's
in Germany, he must

908
00:55:19 --> 00:55:22
be Wagner et al.
 

909
00:55:22 --> 00:55:23
Beautiful experiment.
 

910
00:55:23 --> 00:55:29
You know these number games
where you get a string of

911
00:55:29 --> 00:55:33
numbers and you have to predict
the next number in the series?

912
00:55:33 --> 00:55:37
Well, I can't remember the
particular one here, which is

913
00:55:37 --> 00:55:40
just as well because at MIT all
that would happen is if I

914
00:55:40 --> 00:55:42
presented it, you'd be sitting
there for the rest of the

915
00:55:42 --> 00:55:44
lecture trying to work out
what's the rule here.

916
00:55:44 --> 00:55:47
Anyway, it's a clever --
go look at the paper.

917
00:55:47 --> 00:55:50
It's a beautiful paper.
 

918
00:55:50 --> 00:55:53
But they picked one of these
things where there were

919
00:55:53 --> 00:55:55
two ways to solve it.
 

920
00:55:55 --> 00:55:59
There is a sort of a
laborious multi-step thing.

921
00:55:59 --> 00:56:01
You add the last two
numbers and then divide

922
00:56:01 --> 00:56:04
by the third fac number.
 

923
00:56:04 --> 00:56:05
It's some weird thing.
 

924
00:56:05 --> 00:56:08
You can do it, but it
takes a long time.

925
00:56:08 --> 00:56:14
So, if you measure the amount
of time for -- so this is

926
00:56:14 --> 00:56:17
going to be time again.
 

927
00:56:17 --> 00:56:21
Measure the amount of
time to get the answer.

928
00:56:21 --> 00:56:25
People are initially very long
and then they get better and to

929
00:56:25 --> 00:56:27
get to some sort of stable.
 

930
00:56:27 --> 00:56:30
But there's a trick.
 

931
00:56:30 --> 00:56:34
If you have this flash of
insight, you realize I don't

932
00:56:34 --> 00:56:37
remember what, but there's some
trivial way of knowing what the

933
00:56:37 --> 00:56:42
number is, and if you get it,
it's trivial to see in the data

934
00:56:42 --> 00:56:48
because your time drops like
a rock and it stays there.

935
00:56:48 --> 00:56:53
So now what you do is you take
people, you train them on this.

936
00:56:53 --> 00:57:01
They're at this the high
asymptote here, and

937
00:57:01 --> 00:57:02
you send them away.
 

938
00:57:02 --> 00:57:07
You either send them away
for eight hours of daytime

939
00:57:07 --> 00:57:10
stuff -- come back tonight
we'll test you again.

940
00:57:10 --> 00:57:13
You send them away -- I don't
remember, do they actually

941
00:57:13 --> 00:57:14
keep them in the lab?
 

942
00:57:14 --> 00:57:16
You can keep them in the
lab and keep them awake.

943
00:57:16 --> 00:57:18
Anyway, you send them away at
night because you want to make

944
00:57:18 --> 00:57:20
sure that it's not a day/night
thing, but don't

945
00:57:20 --> 00:57:21
let them sleep.
 

946
00:57:21 --> 00:57:26
Or you have people who go
to sleep and have eight

947
00:57:26 --> 00:57:28
hours worth of sleep.
 

948
00:57:28 --> 00:57:34
The finding is that the next
day -- eight hours later rather

949
00:57:34 --> 00:57:42
-- some people are here, some
people are here or rapidly get

950
00:57:42 --> 00:57:48
here, and 50% more of the
people who had a night's

951
00:57:48 --> 00:57:51
sleep got here.
 

952
00:57:51 --> 00:57:53
It's not that everybody
went to sleep and had

953
00:57:53 --> 00:57:54
this kaboom of insight.
 

954
00:57:54 --> 00:58:02
But seemingly something about
that night sleep produced this

955
00:58:02 --> 00:58:10
rapid burst of insight in many
more people in the sleep group

956
00:58:10 --> 00:58:13
than in the two other groups.
 

957
00:58:13 --> 00:58:17
It's I think the first really
good evidence, experimental

958
00:58:17 --> 00:58:28
evidence, for an ability to get
something more like higher

959
00:58:28 --> 00:58:32
level cognitive thought
happening while you're asleep,

960
00:58:32 --> 00:58:35
Not just these relatively low
level perceptual learning

961
00:58:35 --> 00:58:37
kinds of things.
 

962
00:58:37 --> 00:58:44
So, the general evidence
suggests that sleep has an

963
00:58:44 --> 00:58:49
important role to play in
managing your cognitive

964
00:58:49 --> 00:58:52
light in some fashion.
 

965
00:58:52 --> 00:58:56
It probably serves a role
in consolidating memory.

966
00:58:56 --> 00:59:02
It probably serves a role
in problem solving.

967
00:59:02 --> 00:59:06
It certainly is the sort of
thing that one might think

968
00:59:06 --> 00:59:10
about as one is saying I'm
going to stay up all night

969
00:59:10 --> 00:59:15
reading Gleitman because
tomorrow's the final exam.

970
00:59:15 --> 00:59:17
Well, if you haven't read
Gleitman before the final exam

971
00:59:17 --> 00:59:21
it's probably true that reading
Gleitman all night is better

972
00:59:21 --> 00:59:24
than hoping that eight hours of
sleep will produce a flash of

973
00:59:24 --> 00:59:27
insight about the imagined
contents of Gleitman.

974
00:59:27 --> 00:59:31
 
 

975
00:59:31 --> 00:59:36
All right, let us discuss --
I'm supposed to tell you what's

976
00:59:36 --> 00:59:39
going to happen when you're
sleep deprived I see, but let's

977
00:59:39 --> 00:59:43
do that in a minute after you
wake up the person next

978
00:59:43 --> 00:59:46
to you who's dozed off.
 

979
00:59:46 --> 00:59:47
Because they want to
hear this piece.

980
00:59:47 --> 01:03:05
[INTERMISSION IN LECTURE]
 

981
01:03:05 --> 01:03:05
All right.
 

982
01:03:05 --> 01:03:10
So what happens to you, you
were clearly built to sleep.

983
01:03:10 --> 01:03:15
What happens if you abuse
the privilege and you're

984
01:03:15 --> 01:03:17
running a sleep debt?
 

985
01:03:17 --> 01:03:22
And the answer is most people
here, in fact, most people in

986
01:03:22 --> 01:03:25
America are running some
sort of a sleep debt.

987
01:03:25 --> 01:03:30
What is the cost?
 

988
01:03:30 --> 01:03:35
Well, you can measure cost in
a variety of different ways.

989
01:03:35 --> 01:03:45
You can certainly measure cost
in terms of things like

990
01:03:45 --> 01:03:48
industrial accidents, car
crashes and stuff like that.

991
01:03:48 --> 01:03:56
The classic sleep deprivation
car crash is a crash on a clear

992
01:03:56 --> 01:04:01
straight road on a moonlit
night -- you're a nice long

993
01:04:01 --> 01:04:04
distance trucker who's abusing
the rules about how long you're

994
01:04:04 --> 01:04:06
supposed to be able
to drive at once.

995
01:04:06 --> 01:04:09
You're out, there's no car in
the vicinity, the road is

996
01:04:09 --> 01:04:13
straight, it's not bright
light, but you can

997
01:04:13 --> 01:04:14
see everything.
 

998
01:04:14 --> 01:04:17
The road turns a few degrees
and you go straight

999
01:04:17 --> 01:04:19
out into the cactus or
something like that.

1000
01:04:19 --> 01:04:23
Because when you get really
sleepy, if you take a look at

1001
01:04:23 --> 01:04:26
people's brain waves, you can
watch them flipping into these

1002
01:04:26 --> 01:04:31
little micro sleeps that don't
necessarily last very long, but

1003
01:04:31 --> 01:04:34
at sixty miles an hour, eighty
miles an hour, ninety miles an

1004
01:04:34 --> 01:04:36
hour, they don't need to
last very long for you

1005
01:04:36 --> 01:04:41
to end up in sage brush.
 

1006
01:04:41 --> 01:04:44
There are plenty of ways to
measure it in the lab too.

1007
01:04:44 --> 01:04:51
If you sit somebody in the lab
and tell them all I want you to

1008
01:04:51 --> 01:04:58
do is push a button when I
turn on this little light.

1009
01:04:58 --> 01:05:00
The only thing you need to do.
 

1010
01:05:00 --> 01:05:05
What you discover is that
people are about 200

1011
01:05:05 --> 01:05:11
milliseconds slower at adverse
circadian phase, at the bottom

1012
01:05:11 --> 01:05:17
of that circadian trough than
they are at the top of it.

1013
01:05:17 --> 01:05:19
And on top that just
general slowing.

1014
01:05:19 --> 01:05:21
There are also a whole bunch
of times when they'll just

1015
01:05:21 --> 01:05:23
miss the light altogether.
 

1016
01:05:23 --> 01:05:31
The light will come on and the
subject will be just ah and

1017
01:05:31 --> 01:05:32
not do anything about it.
 

1018
01:05:32 --> 01:05:37
Now, 200 milliseconds,
what's the big deal there?

1019
01:05:37 --> 01:05:39
It's only a fifth of a second.
 

1020
01:05:39 --> 01:05:42
Well, again, at ninety miles an
hour it makes a difference

1021
01:05:42 --> 01:05:47
and if you're flying your
supersonic jet around the skies

1022
01:05:47 --> 01:05:50
of Iraq or something it makes
even more of a difference.

1023
01:05:50 --> 01:05:54
So there's a
generalized slowing.

1024
01:05:54 --> 01:06:02
There is a tendency to
trade-off speed and accuracy

1025
01:06:02 --> 01:06:06
more than usual in
favor of speed.

1026
01:06:06 --> 01:06:11
So people tend, when they're
sleepy -- we've actually

1027
01:06:11 --> 01:06:12
done this in our lab.
 

1028
01:06:12 --> 01:06:15
So if you're doing one of these
visual search kinds of things

1029
01:06:15 --> 01:06:17
where you're looking for
something exciting like where's

1030
01:06:17 --> 01:06:22
the red vertical line, people,
if you go too fast

1031
01:06:22 --> 01:06:23
you make mistakes.
 

1032
01:06:23 --> 01:06:27
People when they're sleepy tend
to be willing to tolerate

1033
01:06:27 --> 01:06:28
higher error rates.
 

1034
01:06:28 --> 01:06:32
Again, that's the sort of thing
that is brought out into the

1035
01:06:32 --> 01:06:38
real world if your error rate
goes up by two or three times,

1036
01:06:38 --> 01:06:42
that could be a real problem
in doing real world tasks.

1037
01:06:42 --> 01:06:46
It is harder to prove but
pretty clear, perhaps

1038
01:06:46 --> 01:06:51
introspectively, that being
sleepy makes you stupid.

1039
01:06:51 --> 01:06:54
You just don't think as well.
 

1040
01:06:54 --> 01:06:57
For a long time it was kind of
hard to show any effects of

1041
01:06:57 --> 01:07:01
sleep deprivation because
people tended to do things like

1042
01:07:01 --> 01:07:05
ask you to add up columns of
numbers, and as long as I smack

1043
01:07:05 --> 01:07:08
you around enough to keep you
awake during the task,

1044
01:07:08 --> 01:07:10
you can do that.
 

1045
01:07:10 --> 01:07:14
But if I ask you to do, I don't
know, your problem set when

1046
01:07:14 --> 01:07:17
you're really sleepy, it turns
out that the throughput on more

1047
01:07:17 --> 01:07:23
complicated cognitive
tasks goes downhill.

1048
01:07:23 --> 01:07:25
You're just not as good at it.
 

1049
01:07:25 --> 01:07:28
Will it kill you?
 

1050
01:07:28 --> 01:07:29
How bad can it be?
 

1051
01:07:29 --> 01:07:32
The answer is probably yes.
 

1052
01:07:32 --> 01:07:39
Not obviously at the level that
people inflict on themselves,

1053
01:07:39 --> 01:07:42
but prolonged sleep deprivation
will kill you if you

1054
01:07:42 --> 01:07:45
are a rat, at least.
 

1055
01:07:45 --> 01:07:49
What kills you is not that you
just get so sleepy that you

1056
01:07:49 --> 01:07:55
fall over dead, but that
staying awake, or more to the

1057
01:07:55 --> 01:08:00
point being kept awake, which
is what's required if you're

1058
01:08:00 --> 01:08:03
going to go any extended period
of sleep deprivation, is highly

1059
01:08:03 --> 01:08:08
stressful, and stress
will kill you.

1060
01:08:08 --> 01:08:11
The rats who die in sleep
deprivation studies

1061
01:08:11 --> 01:08:12
die of things like
 

1062
01:08:12 --> 01:08:16
bleeding ulcers and
stuff like that.

1063
01:08:16 --> 01:08:19
Symptoms that look for
all the world like the

1064
01:08:19 --> 01:08:24
effects of severe stress.
 

1065
01:08:24 --> 01:08:29
You can also ask whether
or not deprivation of

1066
01:08:29 --> 01:08:34
particular kinds of sleep
is particularly damaging.

1067
01:08:34 --> 01:08:39
So, for example, it's
relatively easy to deprive

1068
01:08:39 --> 01:08:41
somebody of REM sleep.
 

1069
01:08:41 --> 01:08:47
You can just monitor their eye
movements or their brain waves

1070
01:08:47 --> 01:08:51
and wake them up every time
they go into REM sleep.

1071
01:08:51 --> 01:08:56
They will sleep for most of the
night that way, but they'll

1072
01:08:56 --> 01:08:58
have little or no REM.
 

1073
01:08:58 --> 01:09:01
You do get effects of that on
these perceptual learning

1074
01:09:01 --> 01:09:05
tasks -- REM seems to
be important in that.

1075
01:09:05 --> 01:09:08
But you can be REM deprived for
an extended period of time

1076
01:09:08 --> 01:09:14
without collapsing in a heap.
 

1077
01:09:14 --> 01:09:15
There are two reasons
we know that.

1078
01:09:15 --> 01:09:17
One of them is that people
have done experimental

1079
01:09:17 --> 01:09:18
studies of this.
 

1080
01:09:18 --> 01:09:21
The other is that one class
of antidepressants known as

1081
01:09:21 --> 01:09:29
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors,
MAOIs, systematically suppress

1082
01:09:29 --> 01:09:34
REM sleep, and these patients
report that they don't dream.

1083
01:09:34 --> 01:09:37
But they don't have obvious
evil side effects.

1084
01:09:37 --> 01:09:41
We don't quite understand how
that relates to these theories.

1085
01:09:41 --> 01:09:43
People on these things don't
say oh my goodness, I

1086
01:09:43 --> 01:09:44
can't learn anymore.
 

1087
01:09:44 --> 01:09:47
So there's something we don't
understand about the

1088
01:09:47 --> 01:09:50
relationship between REM and
learning there, because

1089
01:09:50 --> 01:09:53
otherwise these antidepressants
would have a powerful side

1090
01:09:53 --> 01:09:56
effect, cognitive side
effect that we don't see.

1091
01:09:56 --> 01:10:00
The other way to do this in
animal studies is to keep an

1092
01:10:00 --> 01:10:05
animal REM deprived for a month
at a time and see if the animal

1093
01:10:05 --> 01:10:11
show these sort of stress
symptoms, and the answer seems

1094
01:10:11 --> 01:10:13
to be, well, no, not really.
 

1095
01:10:13 --> 01:10:16
If you get sleep, even without
REM sleep, the stress

1096
01:10:16 --> 01:10:18
part can not be there.
 

1097
01:10:18 --> 01:10:23
Oh, my favorite technique for
REM depriving a cat in this

1098
01:10:23 --> 01:10:26
case, this is a low REM -- if
you want to REM deprive your

1099
01:10:26 --> 01:10:29
cat, here's how you do it.
 

1100
01:10:29 --> 01:10:34
You put the cat -- take a
flower pot, turn the flower pot

1101
01:10:34 --> 01:10:37
upside-down, put the cat on the
flower pot in the middle of

1102
01:10:37 --> 01:10:40
a little artificial lake.
 

1103
01:10:40 --> 01:10:45
Eventually the cat
goes to sleep, right.

1104
01:10:45 --> 01:10:49
Then the cat falls
into REM sleep.

1105
01:10:49 --> 01:10:52
Falls off into the water.
 

1106
01:10:52 --> 01:10:54
Cat doesn't like to
fall into the water.

1107
01:10:54 --> 01:10:57
Cat wakes up.
 

1108
01:10:57 --> 01:11:05
And the cats learns the
not go into REM sleep.

1109
01:11:05 --> 01:11:09
In some sense, trains itself
not to fall into REM sleep,

1110
01:11:09 --> 01:11:12
with the result that you can
REM deprive the cat for an

1111
01:11:12 --> 01:11:14
extended period of time.
 

1112
01:11:14 --> 01:11:15
This is a very weird study.
 

1113
01:11:15 --> 01:11:18
I don't where they
got their measures.

1114
01:11:18 --> 01:11:20
The only thing I can remember
that the only thing they found

1115
01:11:20 --> 01:11:25
that was unusual about this cat
is that a normal cat, you got

1116
01:11:25 --> 01:11:30
the cat food, if you put a July
the 4th kind of sparkler in the

1117
01:11:30 --> 01:11:34
cat food, a normal cat will not
eat the the cat food, but

1118
01:11:34 --> 01:11:36
a REM deprived cat will.
 

1119
01:11:36 --> 01:11:39
Why?
 

1120
01:11:39 --> 01:11:39
I don't know.
 

1121
01:11:39 --> 01:11:41
I don't know nothing
about this.

1122
01:11:41 --> 01:11:46
I only know what I read
in the literature.

1123
01:11:46 --> 01:11:49
Which reminds me, however
-- actually, this should

1124
01:11:49 --> 01:11:51
have reminded me.
 

1125
01:11:51 --> 01:11:53
That the most practical piece
of advice, apart from the

1126
01:11:53 --> 01:11:57
fact you should get eight
hours of sleep at night.

1127
01:11:57 --> 01:12:01
Since you won't get eight hours
of sleep a night, I notice,

1128
01:12:01 --> 01:12:04
I've been lecturing to this
course for twenty plus years,

1129
01:12:04 --> 01:12:10
and in spite of my exortations
that your physical and

1130
01:12:10 --> 01:12:13
cognitive well-being really
relies on you going to sleep at

1131
01:12:13 --> 01:12:15
night, none of you are going to
pay the slightest bit

1132
01:12:15 --> 01:12:16
of attention to that.
 

1133
01:12:16 --> 01:12:18
So the more practical piece
of advice I can give you

1134
01:12:18 --> 01:12:20
is how to sleep in class.
 

1135
01:12:20 --> 01:12:22
 
 

1136
01:12:22 --> 01:12:26
The trick is -- I mean
obviously what you want to do

1137
01:12:26 --> 01:12:33
is you want to sleep in a way
that kind of masks that fact.

1138
01:12:33 --> 01:12:36
The difficulty is this
REM sleep business.

1139
01:12:36 --> 01:12:39
 
 

1140
01:12:39 --> 01:12:47
The problem is the muscle tone
thing and it's the head bob

1141
01:12:47 --> 01:12:55
portion of the-- So I can look
out there and watch the

1142
01:12:55 --> 01:13:03
whiplash and that's
not going to work.

1143
01:13:03 --> 01:13:09
So, what people figure out on
their own is that what you want

1144
01:13:09 --> 01:13:14
to do is you want to give the
illusion that what I or

1145
01:13:14 --> 01:13:19
somebody else is saying is so
deep that you had to close your

1146
01:13:19 --> 01:13:21
eyes to think about it.
 

1147
01:13:21 --> 01:13:25
Now, there are a couple of
important principles here.

1148
01:13:25 --> 01:13:32
One of them is that it's
less convincing that you're

1149
01:13:32 --> 01:13:37
thinking deeply about this
if your mouth falls open.

1150
01:13:37 --> 01:13:41
If you're drooling
it's really bad.

1151
01:13:41 --> 01:13:45
This is good.
 

1152
01:13:45 --> 01:13:47
Support for the chin is good.
 

1153
01:13:47 --> 01:13:53
The other thing that you
learned in like 801 was that

1154
01:13:53 --> 01:13:55
three-legged stools stand
better than two-legged

1155
01:13:55 --> 01:13:56
ones, right?
 

1156
01:13:56 --> 01:13:57
So, I favor these.
 

1157
01:13:57 --> 01:14:01
 
 

1158
01:14:01 --> 01:14:06
I'm really thinking very hard
about what you're saying.

1159
01:14:06 --> 01:14:07
That can actually be
quite -- in fact, you're

1160
01:14:07 --> 01:14:08
not fooling anybody.
 

1161
01:14:08 --> 01:14:11
You know perfectly well
you're sound asleep.

1162
01:14:11 --> 01:14:12
What?
 

1163
01:14:12 --> 01:14:14
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
 

1164
01:14:14 --> 01:14:16
PROFESSOR: Oh, keeping
the airway open is good.

1165
01:14:16 --> 01:14:23
That was the winner of the most
embarrassing moment in Intro

1166
01:14:23 --> 01:14:27
Psych Student Experience.
 

1167
01:14:27 --> 01:14:30
This was actually the first
year I was teaching the course.

1168
01:14:30 --> 01:14:35
I was co-teaching it with
another guy in course nine at

1169
01:14:35 --> 01:14:39
the time and he was lecturing.
 

1170
01:14:39 --> 01:14:41
I've long ago stopped figuring
that this was an editorial

1171
01:14:41 --> 01:14:42
comment when people
fall asleep.

1172
01:14:42 --> 01:14:45
But anyway, somebody sitting
right about over there

1173
01:14:45 --> 01:14:48
fell sound asleep.
 

1174
01:14:48 --> 01:14:52
But nobody was sitting
next to them.

1175
01:14:52 --> 01:14:56
They fell sound asleep and
they started to snore.

1176
01:14:56 --> 01:15:02
Eventually this got like loud
enough that my colleague had

1177
01:15:02 --> 01:15:04
to say somebody's going.
 

1178
01:15:04 --> 01:15:07
If you want the definition of
embarrassed -- the definition

1179
01:15:07 --> 01:15:10
of embarrassed is you're
sitting in lecture, everybody's

1180
01:15:10 --> 01:15:18
looking at you and
you have no idea why.

1181
01:15:18 --> 01:15:21
So, sitting next to somebody's
another good strategy if you're

1182
01:15:21 --> 01:15:22
actually trying to stay
more or less alert.

1183
01:15:22 --> 01:15:28
My old doctoral advisor and I
had this as a pact when I was

1184
01:15:28 --> 01:15:32
in graduate school during the
Friday afternoon, terrible

1185
01:15:32 --> 01:15:34
time, departmental colloquia.
 

1186
01:15:34 --> 01:15:37
We would sit next to each other
and if it was actually talk

1187
01:15:37 --> 01:15:42
that we cared about, we had an
agreement, if I go out, poke

1188
01:15:42 --> 01:15:43
me, because I kind of want to
know what this guy

1189
01:15:43 --> 01:15:44
is talking about.
 

1190
01:15:44 --> 01:15:47
He was department chair.
 

1191
01:15:47 --> 01:15:49
Turns out to be very important,
because one of the rules of

1192
01:15:49 --> 01:15:53
you're department chair is you
have to be able to ask an

1193
01:15:53 --> 01:15:55
intelligent question at
the end of the talk.

1194
01:15:55 --> 01:15:57
Really good department chairs
can do that after sleeping

1195
01:15:57 --> 01:15:59
through the talk.
 

1196
01:15:59 --> 01:16:03
My advisor, who was otherwise
an exemplary department chair,

1197
01:16:03 --> 01:16:08
was caught up short on this at
one talk where he asked a very

1198
01:16:08 --> 01:16:11
good question, but one that he
wouldn't have asked had he been

1199
01:16:11 --> 01:16:14
awake for those twenty
minutes of the talk.

1200
01:16:14 --> 01:16:17
Because the guy had discussed
this matter extensively.

1201
01:16:17 --> 01:16:21
So if we would poke each
other to stay awake.

1202
01:16:21 --> 01:16:25
The guy joined our lab and he
sat two seats away from me.

1203
01:16:25 --> 01:16:27
He went out cold.
 

1204
01:16:27 --> 01:16:29
That's OK.
 

1205
01:16:29 --> 01:16:30
But he started shouting.
 

1206
01:16:30 --> 01:16:35
In Japanese.
 

1207
01:16:35 --> 01:16:36
Actually, it was probably a
 

1208
01:16:36 --> 01:16:38
bonus that it was in Japanese
because whatever he was

1209
01:16:38 --> 01:16:42
shouting was incomprehensible
to anybody else.

1210
01:16:42 --> 01:16:46
I made this sort of dramatic
lunge to get to him before

1211
01:16:46 --> 01:16:48
he could manage to
get out too much.

1212
01:16:48 --> 01:16:53
 
 

1213
01:16:53 --> 01:16:56
So now if you're worried about
that, you kind of want to be

1214
01:16:56 --> 01:16:59
sitting with your friends here
so that when you start talking

1215
01:16:59 --> 01:17:03
in your sleep, somebody can
get to you before it becomes

1216
01:17:03 --> 01:17:05
really desperately obvious.
 

1217
01:17:05 --> 01:17:06
All right.
 

1218
01:17:06 --> 01:17:13
I suppose the bottom line is
that sleep deprivation will

1219
01:17:13 --> 01:17:18
not kill you, but it won't
do anything good for you,

1220
01:17:18 --> 01:17:21
except perhaps getting you
through the your work.

1221
01:17:21 --> 01:17:28
Now, let's see do I want to --
you know this looks like a

1222
01:17:28 --> 01:17:33
pretty good place to entertain
questions and we'll go on to

1223
01:17:33 --> 01:17:36
dreaming after Thanksgiving.
 

1224
01:17:36 --> 01:17:39
Any sleep questions
while we're here?

1225
01:17:39 --> 01:17:42
 
 

1226
01:17:42 --> 01:17:44
We got a question, then
you can run for it.

1227
01:17:44 --> 01:17:52
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
 

1228
01:17:52 --> 01:17:56
PROFESSOR: Well, the piece
of that is right -- so the

1229
01:17:56 --> 01:17:59
question is do you want to
sleeps in cycles of

1230
01:17:59 --> 01:18:00
ninety minutes?
 

1231
01:18:00 --> 01:18:02
Ideally, you want to
wake up on your own.

1232
01:18:02 --> 01:18:06
Typically out of the end
of a REM stage is what

1233
01:18:06 --> 01:18:09
would normally happen.
 

1234
01:18:09 --> 01:18:11
Yes, you will tend to feel
more refreshed there than

1235
01:18:11 --> 01:18:13
if you wake up out of this.
 

1236
01:18:13 --> 01:18:20
But most of us wake up when the
alarm clock goes off and sorry.

1237
01:18:20 --> 01:18:20
But if
 

1238
01:18:20 --> 01:18:23
you can manage to adjust that
to wake you up -- even if you

1239
01:18:23 --> 01:18:25
have to move it a little
earlier, you may feel better

1240
01:18:25 --> 01:18:29
if you're waking yourself
up out of a REM state.

1241
01:18:29 --> 01:18:29
Yup?
 

1242
01:18:29 --> 01:18:32
 
 

1243
01:18:32 --> 01:18:35
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
 

1244
01:18:35 --> 01:18:39
PROFESSOR: Oh, that's
the neck floppy thing.

1245
01:18:39 --> 01:18:43
When your muscles are going,
when you're losing muscle tone

1246
01:18:43 --> 01:18:48
and drifting off into a REM
state, bits of you are kind of

1247
01:18:48 --> 01:18:52
going where gravity wants to go
and that can feel like a

1248
01:18:52 --> 01:18:55
falling sensation, which
inconveniently can sometimes

1249
01:18:55 --> 01:18:57
lurch you back awake, or
conveniently if you happen to

1250
01:18:57 --> 01:19:00
be going out during class.
 

1251
01:19:00 --> 01:19:04
But I think that's typically
an effect of the losing

1252
01:19:04 --> 01:19:05
muscle tone part.
 

1253
01:19:05 --> 01:19:08
 
 

1254
01:19:08 --> 01:19:09
Last chance, here we go.
 

1255
01:19:09 --> 01:19:16
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
 

1256
01:19:16 --> 01:19:18
PROFESSOR: Oh, if you really
live in really, really northern

1257
01:19:18 --> 01:19:23
-- sleep disorders go up as
latitude goes up or way down.

1258
01:19:23 --> 01:19:27
But as long as you're living
someplace where the sun comes

1259
01:19:27 --> 01:19:29
up every day, that's
not an issue.

1260
01:19:29 --> 01:19:32
But yes, absolutely, if you go
and live someplace where it's

1261
01:19:32 --> 01:19:37
dark for six months of the
year, people have disruptions

1262
01:19:37 --> 01:19:41
of their circadian clock and
they start free-running.

1263
01:19:41 --> 01:19:42
All right.
 

1264
01:19:42 --> 01:19:43
Drive carefully.
 

1265
01:19:43 --> 01:19:45
Have a good vacation.
 

1266
01:19:45 --> 01:19:47
