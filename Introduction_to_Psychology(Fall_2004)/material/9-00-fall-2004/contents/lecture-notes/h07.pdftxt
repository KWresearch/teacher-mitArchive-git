Lecture 7 - Memory 
The Abstract: The first part of this lecture will deal with encoding. How do we get material into

memory? The problem, as will be demonstrated, is that there are severe bottlenecks between the

outside world and your long-term memory (sound familiar from attention?). In the second part of

the lecture, we will consider some of the physiology and neuropsychology of memory encoding. 

In particular, we will talk about the role of the hippocampus in the consolidation of memory.

Finally, we will talk a bit about the problems of recall or retrieval from memory. This topic will

carry over into the next lecture.

Lecture Notes:

Why don't you have as much memory as you would like?


Capacity limitations on encoding 
Example from last Tues: Visual Short Term Memory 

Visual Short Term memory – sounds like parking meters 
Visual Working memory – like  your computer desktop 
Are they really different? (Not for our purposes) 

Another Example: "Digit span" (but we will do it with color names, why?) 

Miller, G. A. (1956). The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity 
for processing information. Psychological Review, 63, 81-97. 

7+/- 2 what? 

What is "chunking" (yeah, really) 
Counter-example: Picture memory - Why is it a counter-example? 

Ebbinghaus (Germany, 1885) introduces nonsense into the study of memory 

What nonsense gets into long-term memory? 

For acquisition of new memory, STM (or WM) can be thought of as another bottleneck. How 
much information can get through per unit time?

STM or working memory: the core ideas are 

1)  bottlenecks 
2)  meaning 

Why is meaning important? 

Semantic network as an organizing principle for LTM 

Evidence from priming 

Mnemonics: Using the network 

What part of the brain handles encoding from STM to LTM? 

The neuropsych evidence (see Memento…even if I haven’t) 
Patient HM (Corkin S (1984), Seminars in Neurology, 4, 249-259) 

Lesion of hippocampus & amygdala (why?) 

HM has a severe anterograde amnesia 
Encoding into implicit memory is better than into explicit memory 
(what is that distinction about?) 

See also Declarative vs procedural 

So: Hippocampus is vital to the consolidation of STM to LTM.

Evidence from electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in humans 

Finally, let's begin talking about retrieval from memory 

Memory is not a library or archive - at least, not like any library you know about.

presented in lists. J. Experimental Psychology: Leanring, Memory, and Cognition, 21(4), 803-

Questions to answer from Chapter Seven:


The memory chapter notes that the problem of memory can be divided in the three broad topics

of getting into memory (acquisition or encoding), the mode of storage, and getting material out

of memory (retrieval and forgetting).


P245 You will want to be able to discuss that model in Fig 7.1. Can you muster evidence for all

the parts?


P245 What are primacy and recency effects? 


P247 What is chunking? 


P249 Of course, what people really want to know about memory is how they can get more of it.

So, what does "depth of processing", "understanding", and "mnemonics" are all ways to get more

into memory. How do they differ? How are they similar?


P255 What is implicit memory and how can you measure it or demonstrate its existence? 


P256 The book makes the good point that "forgetting" is a term that covers a large number of 
distinguishable phenomena. What, for example, is the difference between "decay" and 
"interference" as causes of forgetting? How could you tell these apart with an experiment? 

P262 Memory distortion is one of the most important "real world" topics in the study of memory. 
How can memories be distorted? What does this mean for eye witness testimony? 

P266 What is a repressed memory? Why is the concept problematic? 

P268ff You will want to know the difference between anterograde and retrograde amnesia. 

P269 and you will want to be able say something about some of the specific cases discussed 
here.

This is a ref for the idea that when a memory is reactivated, it becomes plastic again 
and needs to be reconsolidated. Very interesting and very new. Also very technical.

And this is a ref that says that there may be a neural signal that can tell true form false 
memory. If you write about this, consider the social/political implications if this proved to 
the basis for a test that could be used in criminal (or other) investigations. Good idea? 
Unconstitutional? You decide.
