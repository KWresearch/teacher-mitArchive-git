Cognition:  Using  the Mind	

Fall  '04 

Lecture 8 - Cognition 
The Abstract:  This lecture will focus on are some of the ways that our thought processes diverge
from the "thought processes" of a computer might "think". There are two main points (each with
implications) 
1)  A computer, if asked nicely, retrieves exactly what was stored. You do not. 
a.	 This has very important implications, for example, in the sphere of criminal justice.
2)  A computer, if programmed correctly, will do very precise calculations of things like

conditional probabilities. You, typically, do not.

a.	 This has important implications, for example, in the spheres of public policy debates
and consumer behavior. 
The general conclusion is that human cognition is a mix of rational, logical processes and emotional
response. For the present (and perhaps to our surprise) that works better than the cold logic of the
computer in running the world. 
Lecture Notes: 

A  lot of thinking involves bringing things back from LTM and moving the bits around in Working
memory but there are real limits to the computer desktop metaphors. 
Point 1: Recall  is not  just  taking stuff out of storage. 
What can influence retrieval? (You want to know an example for each of these)

OLD 1. The Context of remembering:

OLD 2. The retriever's bias can provide context

NEW 3. Failures of source monitoring

"Man's most valuable trait is a judicious sense of what not to believe"
from Helen - Euripides (412 BCE) 
Can you comprehend without belief? 
cryptomnesia .- a special case of a failure of source monitoring 
NEW 4. False Memories 
Loftus, E. F. (1992). When a lie becomes memory's truth: Memory distortion after exposure to
misinformation. Current directions in Psychological Science., 1(4), 121-123. 
NEW 5. Becoming plastic, again (a topic to write about, perhaps) 
MAYBE: What is the distinction between narrative and propositional thought?

Point Two: We are not  little  logic engines 
LET'S TALK ABOUT RISK 
Risk assessment is based more on narrative than on propositional thought.

Examples might include….

--------------------------------- FRAMING DEMO --------------------------------------

Suppose that the US is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual flu. It is expected to kill 600

people. Here are two things that we can do.

If Program A is adopted, 400 people will die.

If Program B is adopted, there is a 1/3 chance that that no one will die and a 2/3 chance that 600

people will be die.

--------------------------------- End --------------------------------------

The way a problem is framed is important (say Kahneman and Tversky) 
LET'S TALK ABOUT STEREOTYPING (SORT OF) 
--------------------------------- BASE RATE DEMO --------------------------------------
Henry is a short, slim man. He likes to read poetry. He has been active in environmental and

feminist causes. Henry is a _________________.

Here are some possibilities:

Rank order these candidate answers from most probable to least probable:

MOST PROBABLE  _____  _____  _____  _____  _____  _____ LEAST PROBABLE

A. A truck driver
B. Ivy League Classics Professor
C. A course XXI major (humanities)  or 
D. A course VI major (EE&CS)
E. A truck driver who is a member of the Audubon Society & Mensa
--------------------------------- END --------------------------------------
People aren't good at base rates. What does that mean? 
Given a question that asks "Is it probable?"
People hear "Is it typical?". 
Why do we do this?? Is it an "adaptive" berhavior? 
What should you do if you see a a big hulking guy with what looks like a bat coming your
way on a dark night? 

LET'S TALK ABOUT MONEY 
That sounds like a realm where logic and math should rule. 
Danny Kahneman (now at Princeton) won a Nobel prize for elaborating on the (apparently)
odd rules that actually govern our economic behavior.
See Kahnemen and Tversky, 1979, Econometrica, 47, 263-292

FOR EXAMPLE: How much is a dollar worth? 

This works starts with Bernoulli (18th cent)

U (utility of the money) ~= log($) 
Some illustrative "gambles" 
($100, .5, -$100)
The notation means that you win $100 with probability = 0.5. Otherwise you loose $100.
Would you play? 
Expected  value  (E)= Σ(Payoff * Prob) = (100 * 0.5) + (-100 * 0.5) = 0 
How about ($100, .5, -$98)? etc 
LET'S TALK ABOUT LOGIC 
The Wason Selection Task 

E 

S

Each card has a letter on the front and a number on the back.

If the card has a vowel on the front, then it has an odd number on the back.

Which card(s) do you need to check to confirm if this rule is valid for these cards? 

Some versions of this task are easier than others. 
1) Why?
2) Why do we care? Is this a real problem?

Thoughts about Chapter Eight: 
P278ff - Lecture is not going to cover the material on mental imagery even though this is an
interesting topic. Look at Fig 8.1 to get a feeling for your own ability to rotate an image in your
mind. 
While you are at it, think about how you would answer the question "How many windows are there
in your parents' home?" I bet there was some imagery involved. 
P283 Fig 8.5 is a classic of Psychology for social gatherings. You can win money getting people to
bet on the Reno - San Diego thing. 
P284 discusses the idea of a semantic network…which we will have mentioned earlier, I think. 
P287-298 Problem Solving: I hate to admit it, but I have never much cared for the problem solving
literature - at least not as it gets played out in Intro Psych texts. Still, you can have fun solving the
various puzzles presented here. I think that the ideas are largely descriptive. Maybe I am being
unfair. You decide. 
P300-1 Discusses the Wason selection task, overlapping with lecture. Why is this interesting? 
P302-309 Discusses more of the Kahneman and Tversky-style work on heuristics in reasoning.
You want to be able to define some of the various heuristics or short-cuts that we seem to use in our 
reasoning. 
P311 If you are interested in the Neural Correlates of Consciousness (the NCC as Christof Koch
labels it), you could read his book or you could read my review of his book: Wolfe, J. M. (2004).

Something  to write  about  #8: Daniel Wegner's  disturbing  thoughts  about  thought. 

We are inclined to think that we are in control of what we do. However, there is a lot of 
recent work  that  calls  this  into question. Daniel Wegner  (Harvard) has done  some of 
the most  interesting  that  I know about  (and seems  to have written a great deal on  the 
topic (http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~wegner/pubs.htm). I have put a couple of papers 
that I like in Folder #8. They make a good starting place for a paper.
