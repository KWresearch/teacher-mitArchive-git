Lecture 20: The nature and treatment of mental illness 
The Abstract: Ideology has not served us well in the realm of mental illness. Efforts to 
squeeze all mental illness into a single framework - from Freudian to Behaviorist to 
Neurochemical – do not work. There are lots of ways for the brain/mind to run off the 
rails and each needs to be examined for its own particular combination of causes and 
handled with its own particular mix of treatments. Some "disorders" don't seem to be 
mental illnesses at all (Example 1: Suicide terrorism). Some probably have a "brain 
disease" at root (Ex 2 – Schizophrenia). Others are predominantly environmental in cause 
(Ex. 3 – Posttraumatic stress disorder). Almost no mental disorder is purely one or the 
other (Ex 4 – depression) and treatment can often be approached via the "brain" or the 
"mind" (Ex 5 – Obsessive-compulsive disorder). 
Lecture Notes 
Three misguided theories: 
a. 
that all psychiatric problems are psychodynamic in nature, 
b.  That all psychiatric problems are the product of a disordered brain 
c.  That all psychiatric problems are essentially character flaws 

These come with ideas about treatment, too. 

Example 1: Are suicide terrorists insane? 

The Genesis of Suicide Terrorism. Scott Atran, Science. Mar 7, 2003 v299, pp1534-1539 

A bit of history 

How does this come to pass? NOTE: As ever to explain is not to condone 

Do they show evidence of mental illness? 

What other theories might we have 

Theory 1: Personality attributes 

The “fundamental attribution error” revisited


Theory 2: Deprivation theories 


Theory 3: Sociopathaology


Are they like members of violent racist groups?

Theory 4: fictive kin 

Example 2: Schizophrenia 
= Split mind (but NOT like multiple personality disorder) 

A division between intellectual and affective parts of personality. 

What did Freud say? 

What did later Freudians say? 

the schizophrenogenic parent (mother) & the double bind 

Drugs emptied the hospitals of schizo. patients were drugs like 
e.g. Chlorpromazine (=thorazine) blocks dopamine receptors

Some interesting history:Hobson, J. A., & Leonard, J. A. (2001). Out of its mind: Psychiatry in 
crisis. Cambridge, MA: Perseus. 

Not simply a brain awash in dopamine. 

Reducing function of all dopamine receptors can have nasty side effects 
(Parkinsons disease is the result of too little dopamine) 

Thinking about the roots of mental illness. 

In 1900, about half of the patients in mental hospitals had a disorder called dementia paralytica 

This is no longer true. What happened? 

Example 3: Shell shock -> post-traumatic stress disorder 

A mental illness with a clear psychological cause 

A bit more history: Ever heard of "Drapetomania"? 

Does this still happen?

Let's collect some data 


Jim wears an aluminum foil hat on his head at all time. This, he says, is to keep the microwaves

out of his brain. He believes that doctors in a big Boston hospital are controlling his brain as part

of a conspiracy to take over the country. He says that he hears their voices broadcast directly into

his head.


How weird is Jim?

Sam is a shy, almost withdrawn man. His major passion is collecting women’s undergarments.

He doesn't DO anything with them. He just arranges them by age and country of

origin. He lives alone and does not socialize much.


How weird is Sam?

Jack believes that the US is controlled by a small group of capitalists. He advocates a workers 
revolution. He gives long speeches on the subject to anyone who will listen in Harvard Square. 
He also "publishes" a photocopied "newspaper" devoted to his views.

The Points: 
1)  The border between the odd and the abnormal is not sharp. 
2)  Type treatment is not perfectly correlated with cause of disease. 

What are the causes of mental illness? Back to schizophrenia

Is there evidence for a genetic component?


Concordance rates in twins (remember IQ?) 


MZ twins ... concordance about  50% 

DZ twins ...  concordance about  15%

DZ who think they are MZ 
<  50% 

Is there evidence for environmental contributions? 

The mind like the body can be "sick" or abnormal in a number of ways. 

Example 4: Depression 

Some invented patients 

Sarah has had a bad day and she is depressed. She bombed an exam. Her boyfriend just

announced that he is leaving her because he is in love with her best friend, and it is

raining.


Should we give her medication?

Sam is depressed. There is no particular reason for this. It just happens to Sam. He 

oscillates between manic days when he is so up that it hard to concentrate on anything

and depressed days when he is, well, depressed. Lately, these cycles of mania and

depression have been getting faster.


Should we give him medication?

Emma is not particularly depressed. She is what we would call dysphoric (opposite of 
euphoric). She just doesn't seem to be able to enjoy herself. Things are just kind of flat. 
This isn't new. This is pretty much the way she has always been. 

VOTE: If we assume that it would change matters, should we give her medication?

Depression is not one thing and that is certainly true.


Unipolar vs bipolar


If time (maybe) typical vs atypical depression


Do anti-depressants work? 

Maybe 

Why don't they work right away?  Here is one interesting thought 

Jacobs, B. L., Praag, H., & Gage, F. H. (2000). Adult brain neurogenesis and psychiatry: 
a novel theory of depression. Mol Psychiatry, 5(3), 262-269. 

Drugs are slow because they promote neurogenesis….ma 

Does psychotherapy work? 

Maybe 

The mind is what the brain does: A specific example 
Baxter, Lewis R. (1992) Caudate glucose metabolic rate changes with both drug and 
behavior therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Archives of General Psychiatry 
49(9) 681-689 

Example 5 – Obsessive-compulsive  disorder 

Does Prozac work? 

Does behavior therapy work? 

What happens when drugs make us better than we ever were?
