Lecture 22: Eating Disorders 
The Abstract: In the next two lectures, I am going to talk about eating disorders and date rape.
This sounds like an odd pair but there are some interesting similarities: 
1)  Both are problems with biological, psychological, and social components.

2)  Each is a sex-specific pathology (more prevalent in one sex)

3)  Neither is well explained or treated by a pure medical / pharmaceutical account

4)  Each can be seen as successful goal directed behavior

5)  Each is clearly not really a success.

These are successful disasters. Starting with eating disorders: Anorexia Nervosa is a disorder
characterized by self-starvation. It may have roots in a child's desire to control a life that seems out of
control. Single modality treatments have not been a great success. A mixture of approaches –
pharmacology,  behavior modification, & talk therapy – seems to be the best bet. Bulimia is a disorder
characterized by a binge/purge eating pattern. The core issues may still have to do with control and a
mixed treatment may, again be the best bet. (We will call date rape "lecture 23" and give it an abstract of
its own. 
Lecture Notes 
Anorexia Nervosa 
The clinical criteria for a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa are: 
Refusal to maintain body weight normal for age and height. 
An intense fear of becoming overweight. 
A distortion of body image 
In women, a cessation of menstrual cycles for at least 3 months. 
Incidence rates 
My most recent source is:
P. J. Hay, "Integrating Treatment in Eating Disorders," Psychiatric Times, vol. 19, 2002. 
An estimated point prevalence of 0.5% in young women

" point prevalence" is the rate right now, at this point

That is just anorexia. A patient might have

An  "eating disorder not otherwise specified" (EDNOS) 

That is more common 2-5% of young women

At least 5% mortality rate 
Rates have risen over the last 40 years.

Etiology (What are the causes?) 
TWO  CAUTIONS 
1.  We are not talking about you (etc)
2.  Contributing factors are not the same as flawless predictions of disease. 
Characteristics of the girl (recall that the typical patient is female): 

Characteristics of the family: 

Societal pressures:

A society obsessed with eating and with thinness.

Barbie, Miss America, and James Bond's girlfriends

magic cures for imperfections

The superwoman myth

Biological factors


How might all of this conspire to produce anorexia? 
Perhaps as a trap that the girl falls into. 

Treatment 
"simple" stories have not worked well.

1)  Psychoanalytic (and other talk therapies)

2)  Behavior Modification

3)  It is all society's fault.

4)  Have a pill


Hybrid approaches 

Is there a role for the family? 

Prognosis:

Bulimia  Nervosa 
Incidence rates 
10-20% of college age women have some experience with bulimia.

About 30:1 female

1% point incidence

Lecture 23: Date Rape 
The Abstract: In this lecture, we look at date rape (also called acquaintance rape). It is distinct from what
is sometimes called "blitz rape" – the stranger in the bushes variety of sexual assault. A distinguishing
characteristic of date rape is that it is a behavior that we consider pathological (and/or criminal) committed
by people who do not appear to be psychopathological. Here we want to know how abnormal behavior
can arise from the normal mind. In this case, I will propose a story that combines 1) the power of
narrative thought – the stories we tell ourselves, 2) aspects of operant conditioning, and 3) a bit  of 
evolutionary psychology into another "successful disaster". 
Lecture Notes 
Hippolyta, I wooed the with my sword,

And won thy love doing thee injuries 

But I will wed the in another key,

with pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.

Shakespeare, Midsummers Night's Dream 1:1:16-19 

A case literally ripped from the headlines 
What are the chances that she is thinking:

I think I will get drunk out of my mind and engage in a variety of

sexual acts with six guys while I slip in and out of consciousness.

What are the chance that he is thinking

I will take her home and force or coerce her into having sex with

all my roommates.

Lots of questions – most of which we cannot address 
Today's basic question 
Given that this isn't the way she, he, or we want things to work out

HOW does it happen that the guy next door finds himself accused of sexual assault?

gender-specific: 95% of cases involve male assaults on females.

There are biological, psychopathological, and sociological accounts.

Surprise: None of them work by themselves 
NOTE (again): Explaining a behavior is not the same as condoning a behavior. 
Incidence 
From Koss et al (1987)

25% of women report intercourse because "they were overwhelmed by a man's

continual arguments and pressure"

Think about being "overwhelmed by a man's continual arguments and pressure"
 sexual relations are different from other relations 

Etiology 
A bit of evolutionary psych review
What do men want? What do women want? And when? 

risk factors

who pays (really?)

who drives (really?)

What is a risk factor anyway.


heavy drinking (The Risk Factor)
(50-75% incidence in various studies) 
"The superego is soluble in alcohol" 
says  Franz Alexander (early US Freudian) 
"Better" living through chemistry
now we can improve on merely getting drunk 
flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) =The date-rape drug (there are others) 
Alcoholic beverages potentiate the drug effects. 
What you do at time A is a risk factor for time B 
Miscommunication (The Other Really Big Risk Factor)

Theories 
Psychopathology: These guys are sick. 

Evolutionary Psych: All guys are sick (a gender-wide pathology?) 
Thornhill, R., & Thornhill, N. W. (1992). The evolutionary Psychology of men's coercive
sexuality. Brain and Behavioral Sciences, 15(2), 363-421. 
The argument 
Is there any evidence for this? 

Feminist accounts. 
A way to induct younger men into masculine roles? 
The role  of pornography (see Katherine McKinnon) 
A "male confidence racket" where "good males" protect women from "bad males". 
A hybrid theory (and review for the final) 
Sexual behavior is about narrative thought

Where does the script come from?

How is the dialog?


The power of conditioning

The evolutionary psych backdrop


Consider the ambiguous "no". 

Remember variable ratio schedules  of reinforcement 

Remember shaping? 

A route to another successful disaster 

And then?
