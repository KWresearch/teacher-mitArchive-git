#13 The Battle of the Sexes

Lecture 13  – The Battle of the Sexes 
The Abstract:  Men and women appear to have different goals and desires when it 
comes to sexual / romantic relationships? Why is that? In this lecture,  I will present the 
view of Evolutionary Psychology. In brief, the argument is that differences in biology 
(e.g. who get pregnant) lead to differences in psychology. We will look at the
evolutionary explanations for the cliché's about men wanting sex and women wanting 
commitment. 

Lecture Notes:

Chris and Terry are having an argument.


Are there differences between men and women in matters of sex, love, & romance? 


The Clarke & Hatfield, (1989) – How did they get this past the IRB?!


Men and women experimenters approached total strangers on a college campus, and said

Hi, I’ve been noticing you around campus, and I find you very attractive


Then they asked one of three questions:

Would you go out on a date with me? 
Would you go back to my apartment with me? 
Would you have sex with me? 

So….what do the data look like? 

Where would results like this come from? 

Today: An Evolutionary Perspective 
Good general sources 
RichardWright: The Moral Animal 
Buss, The Evolution of Desire 
Pinker, How the Mind Works 
Baumeister & Tice D. The Social Dimension of Sex 

(Next time: An Economic approach) 

The Basic Story: 

What is your goal (from an evolutionary point of view)? 

How you going to do that?

What does sex do? 

You get pregnant….but only if you are a woman 

The instant battle. 
What does he want? 

What does she want? 

NOTE: You can make up other stories....and find animals to back them up. 

Is there any evidence for innate, evolutionary forces in mate selection in humans? 

What would that evidence look like? 

Example: young healthy people (women, especially) are 
considered more attractive than old and or sick. 

Why isn't that trivial? 

Example: What is "attractive"? 

Age:  Women prefer men who are slightly ____________ 

Men prefer  women who are slightly ____________ 

Teenage males? 

Fidelity in relationships: Who should cheat? 

Guys? 

Women? 

Spiders (if we have time…otherwise ask me sometime) 

Who should care? 


Guys?

Women? 

A problem? Are women inclined to be unfaithful? 

yes...it has an evolutionary advantage 

but... 

advantage 

so maybe women should be faithful...it has an evolutionary 

maybe they should be uninterested in sex 

maybe they should pretend to be uninterested in sex 

so…what is the problem? 

Civilization meets evolution 

pregnancy 

For example: effective contraception decouples sex from 

There are at least two ways to think about this 

A list of problems (You supply the examples and/or solutions) 

Problem 1: The theory is not well specified enough 

Problem 2: The theory does not explain the full range of behavior 

Problem 3: Civilization may have changed the rules 

Problem 4: The theory says lots about you as a group and little about
you as an individual. 

Next time: Individuals 
"Lovers and madmen have such seething brains 
such shaping fantasies, that apprehend 
more than cool reason ever comprehends. 
The lunatic, the lover, and the poet 
Are of imagination all compact."
