Lecture 3 - Learning 
Lecture Three: Association Learning and Behaviorism 
The abstract: In this lecture, I will make four main points.
1)  Classical conditioning (learning of stimulus-stimulus associations) is a very rule-
governed phenomenon.
2)  Operant (or instrumental) conditioning (learning the consequences of your actions)
has many fundamental similarities with classical conditioning.
3)  Association learning exerts an important influence on human as well as animal
behavior. 
4)  However, Behaviorism, the effort to build a complete psychology out of association
learning, went too far and is an interesting and important failure. 
The  outline:

POINT 1: CLASSICAL (PAVLOVIAN) CONDITIONING

unconditioned 
stimulus (US) 

unconditioned 
response (UR) 
conditioned 
response (CR) 

conditioned

stimulus (CS) 


What is being learned here? 
A word about consciousness 
Several words about constraints on learning 
1.	 What is a stimulus? This sounds trivial but isn't. 
2.	 Overshadowing shows that you need to notice the stimulus - stimulus
connection: What is the paradigm? 
3.	 Contingency: Relationships must be predictive. Mere contiguity is not enough, 
3.5 Extinction (of a response, not the organism):
Why is extinction a subhead under contingency? 
4.  Preparedness shows that we are not just general purpose association learners. 
5. Timing is critical - specifically, the CS->US interval. 
6. Sensory Pre-conditioning points the way to more complex learning. 
POINT 2: OPERANT CONDITIONING 
Point 2: OPERANT CONDITIONING 
Remember the cat in the puzzle box? 

Let's do this again with a pigeon (rats are good, too)

Lecture 3 - Learning 
We use the Law of Effect to shape the animal. 
Now we can use reinforcement to control the behavior of the organism
"The Behavior of Organisms" B F Skinner (1938)

In fact, contingencies of reinforcement rule the pigeon's behavior

"Contingencies of Reinforcement" B F Skinner (1969)

You should be able to describe the effects of

Fixed and Variable Ratio (FR, VR)schedules of reinforcement 
Fixed and Variable Interval (FI, BI) schedules of reinforcement 
and 
Extinction in operant conditioning 
POINT 3: YOU ARE A SLAVE TO THESE RULES, TOO. 
Example 1: Food aversion

Garcia, J., & Koelling, R. A. (1966). Relation of cue to consequence in avoidance learning.

Psychonomic Science, 20, 313-314.

Example 2: Superstitious Behavior

Example 3: Parents and Children - who is conditioning whom?

Extinction & schedules of reinforcement revisited 
Example 4: "Getting to yes"
schedules of reinforcement in sexual behavior 
POINT 4: BEHAVIORISM 
John Watson: "founder" of Behaviorism 
"I believe that we can write a Psychology; define it as...the science of behavior... and never
go back upon our definition: never use the terms consciousness, mental states, mind,
content, introspectively verifiable, imagery, and the like... It can be done in terms of habit
formation, habit integration, and the like."  {Psych Rev., 1913, 20, 158-77} 
A sketch of radical (Watsonian?) behaviorism. 
1. RULES
2. AUTOMATIC RULES (and a note about consciousness)
3. ENVIRONMENTALLY-DRIVEN RULES
4.  GENERAL RULES - Of course, there are some biological constraints butâ€¦ 
Today, Evolutionary Psychology begs to differ 
Why aren't we all Behaviorists?
