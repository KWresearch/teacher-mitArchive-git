Lecture Four: Sensation and Signal Detection Theory 
The abstract: This lecture will have three (or four) parts
1)  We will discuss the general problem of using the senses to understand the world. 
2)  We will trace the visual pathway from eye to brain. 
3)  We will consider the most basic sorts of perceptual decisions in the context of Signal
Detection Theory and we will discuss some of the broader applications of the theory.�
4)  We might get on to color vision….but history suggests that I may get side tracked long�
before that.�
The  outline: 
POINT 1: THE BIG QUESTIONS: How do we see? How hard can that be to understand? 
A three-part answer 
Sensation - Getting data in to the system from the world�
Attention - Selecting some of the data�
Perception - Interpreting the data
POINT 2: From eye to brain

This is the Hermann (or Hering) grid….why is it interesting?�
There is an endless amount of fascinating material to discuss�
here. I am a vision researcher so we might get stuck here�
forever…�
And we are ignoring the other senses…which is heartbreaking.�
Ah….well�

POINT THREE: Signal Detection Theory 
Just about the simplest possible perceptual question: Did you see that spot of light in the dark? 
What is an absolute threshold? 
How sensitive are you to light?

Questions to answer from Chapter Five:�

P171 Can you describe Weber's Law and Fechner's law. Can you say a word about why they are
of any interest? 
P173 Signal detection theory will get discussed in lecture. It tends to confuse people. But,
especially for the mathematically inclined, it is an interesting and important piece of the study of the 
senses. 
P177 Can you describe the transduction of auditory stimuli from pressure waves in the air to a
neural signal? You will want to be able to say something about the ossicles, cochlea, basilar
membrane, & hair cells. 
P184 The structure of the eye will get covered in lecture and I won't repeat the terminology here. 
P184 What does brightness contrast tell you about the way we see the world? 
P189 What does  lateral  inhibition do  for us? 
P190 Color vision….oy, color vision. People ask more questions and get more confused about
color vision than about any other topic in the course. So, here are the important points 
1)  Light is the portion of the EM spectrum containing wavelengths between about 400 and 700
nanometers (nm). Sunlight includes all of these wavelengths. 
2)  Physical objects differ in the percentages of different wavelengths reflected from their
surfaces. 
3)  You have three types of cone photoreceptors. Each is broadly sensitive to a wide range of
wavelengths. However, they differ in their sensitivities as shown in this picture. 
4)  This means that a single wavelength at a single�
intensity will produce three different responses:�
from the long- (L), medium- (M), and short-
wavelength sensitive cones (S).�
5)  In fact, any combination of wavelengths, no�
matter how complicated, will produce three�
responses; one each from the L, M, & S cones.� S
This is the heart of Trichromatic theory
500 
700 
600 
(=Young-Helmholtz theory – p192). 
Wavelength (nm ) 
6)  SO if two very different physical stimuli produce�
the same three responses, they will appear identical. They are metamers.�
7)  In determining the hue (p190) of a surface or a light, it is the ratio of the L, M, & S cone
responses that is important. Specifically, the L/M ratio tells you how red or green a surface
appears and the (L+M)/S ratio tells you how yellow (L+M) or blue it is. This is the heart of
opponent process theory (194). Trichromacy is step one. Opponent processes are step 2. 
8)  Color mixing confuses the pants off people but it is not that complicated. It is just about
determining what stimulus reaches the eye.

9)�In additive color mixture, two or more lights are combined so that the union of the two 
sets of wavelengths reach the eye. So if light one is the set {400 & 500 nm} and light two is
the set {600 & 650 nm},  light one plus light two will be the set {400, 500, 600, 650}. 
10) In subtractive color mixture, filters remove light and you see the intersection of the filter 
properties. Paint, for example, is a filter. It sucks up one set of wavelengths and reflects
back the remaining subset. Suppose you start with sunlight containing wavelengths from
400 to 700 nm. Now, let's pass that light through filter one. Let's suppose it pass
wavelengths between 500 and 600 nm. Let's pass that remaining light through filter two,
suppose it only passes light between 400 and 550nm. The resulting subtraction will leave
you with light between 500 and 550 nm – the only wavelengths passed by both filters. 
Hope that helps….. 
P197 and you should be able to define the term "receptive field". 

Something to write about, #4: Kitaoka's Snakes 

Akiyoshi Kitaoka makes  some of  the best  visual  illusions  in  the world. You will  find his 
snakes on the course web page in the KITAOKA'S SNAKES file. You can also visit his 
web page.  It has all sorts of gorgeous  things on  it. 
http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/index-e.html 
His explanation is posted in the same file on our webpage

Do you have a theory?�
