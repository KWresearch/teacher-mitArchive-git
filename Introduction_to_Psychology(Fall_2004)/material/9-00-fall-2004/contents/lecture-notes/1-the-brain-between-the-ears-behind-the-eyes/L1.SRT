6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
PROFESSOR: Handout
for today's lecture.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And you'll get a sheet that
asks you about your preferences

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
for recitation time.
 

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
For the moment, that's the
critical piece of paper.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What you want to do is, if you
are -- well whoever you are,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
get your name on their, your ID
number, I don't remember,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
it probably asks for
your email address.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It does not ask for your year.
 

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Please put that, and also
put down if you're a

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
BCS Course Nine major.
 

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We will attempt to lottery
into the class as many

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
of you as we can.
 

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And we will do that,
basically, today.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And you'll get an email from
us telling you whether you

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
are in the class or not.
 

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I will take care of all those
add-drop cards then next

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Tuesday when we meet again.
 

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
How many people here are here
without being lotteried in,

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
just to give me a feeling for?
 

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 
 

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Well, all right how many
people are lotteried in?

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
How many people don't think
they know what that means?

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
OK, good.
 

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 
 

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Well, we'll see what we can do.
 

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We will try to squeeze as
many of you in as we can.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Those of you who are not
lotteried in, do not check

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
the little box that says,
I was lotteried in.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Because we can check and if you
a nasty lying person, we don't

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
want you in this class and we
will do bad things to

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
you or something.
 

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 
 

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let me see.
 

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What, yes --
 

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
PROFESSOR: OK.
 

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Let's do it that way.
 

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Who still needs a syllabus?
 

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 
 

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
OK.
 

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 
 

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Oh, I see we have a new
improvement this year.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Last year they didn't have a
cool digital clock there.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 
 

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
OK.
 

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Who still needs a
writing assignment?

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 
 

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm just trying to see
which, who still needs

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
a writing assignment?
 

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's the one that says
writing assignments on it.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
All right.
 

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So they're scattered
around randomly, too.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't understand
how this is working.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But I'm sure it's
working somehow.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 
 

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I need a Handout 1 by the way,
when somebody has a Handout 1.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No, I've read the syllabus.
 

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 
 

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Well, here, you just
got deputized.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Who still needs the cool
TA signup, recitation

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
signup sheet?
 

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This lovely person
will help you.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Up there somewhere.
 

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 
 

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If you're just coming in, come
down here and collect handouts.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Somebody please deliver me
enough handouts so we can

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
give people handouts.
 

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
There's the handout
for today's lecture.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 
 

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
There are four things
altogether, sit around until

77
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
the other two show up.
 

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 
 

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
All right, these
are the other two.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 
 

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
All right let's try
this game again.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Who's still looking
for a syllabus.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
A couple of syllabi, out in
the cheap seats back there.

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And a few over there.
 

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
OK, who still needs the
writing assignments?

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We need some writing
assignments down front.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 
 

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
And who still needs the
recitation signup sheet?

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's the critical one.
 

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Recitation signup sheet,
who's got those?

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 
 

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,000
OK.
 

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Once you've got
stuff, you can go.

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 
 

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Leave me all the extras.
 

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
At this point, if you don't
have one of the handouts,

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
pick it up later.
 

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Unless you're still missing
the recitation signup sheet.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:18,000
None of the other stuff
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,000
OK.
 

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Is there anybody who still
needs the recitation sheet?

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No, OK, good.
 

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
So, name, ID, email, year.
 

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Whether or not
you're a BCS major.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Pick your top four choices.
 

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Number them one, two, three,
and four, because we'll try to

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
put you in your first choice.
 

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 
 

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And tell us whether you're a
winner in the Haas lottery.

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 
 

111
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
There will be handouts,
typically, in each lecture.

112
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Typically they will be there
and there when you come in.

113
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And, remember the there part.
 

114
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Because when 300 people
all try to get it there,

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
it's kind of a pain.
 

116
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So either side in the front.
 

117
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
How many people need more
time with this exciting

118
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
recitation sheet?
 

119
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 
 

120
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
We want it now.
 

121
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We want it instantly, because
we're going to solve the

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
problem of recitations.
 

123
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Actually, I suppose we don't
have to solve it before the

124
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
end of class this way, do we?
 

125
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But we might as well, while
we've got everybody here.

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So do that now.
 

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And while people are playing
with that, I will entertain any

128
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
other entertaining questions
about the course that

129
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
are on people's minds.
 

130
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes?
 

131
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

132
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
PROFESSOR: Is the fifth
edition book OK?

133
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You can use the fifth edition.
 

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
We're on to the sixth edition.
 

135
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You can use the fifth edition
as long as you don't come and

136
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
complain if you get the
question wrong on the final

137
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
because the info happens to
have been in the sixth edition.

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Basically, you're not
going to flunk the course

139
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
using the fifth edition.
 

140
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's not going to
be a big issue.

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But it's a dealer's choice.
 

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You do it at your own risk.
 

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The risk is smallish.
 

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You can decide if it trades
off sufficiently with

145
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
the money involved.
 

146
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I like the first
edition best, myself.

147
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I think it's all been
downhill since then.

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
But I wouldn't use the first
edition at this point.

149
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Anything else that I should
be answering about the

150
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
course while people are
playing with forms?

151
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yes.
 

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

153
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
PROFESSOR: It's an hour.
 

154
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 
 

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Once a week.
 

156
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
At a time that you are
currently determining

157
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
for yourself with luck.
 

158
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
OK.
 

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Time for another round
of polling here.

160
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
How many people still would
like more time to play

161
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
with this exciting form?
 

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 
 

163
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I will take the opportunity, at
least I will try to take the

164
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
opportunity, depends if I can
find the opportunity This

165
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
is a Hass-D course.
 

166
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Your writing papers.
 

167
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Some of you know that
that's hard work for you.

168
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Some of you will discover that
you and your TA disagree about

169
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
your talents in writing.
 

170
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
In either case, you may want to
avail yourself of the fact that

171
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
we have three writing tutors
attached to this course.

172
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
They're good, they
do great stuff.

173
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
At least your predecessors
have told me so.

174
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And it is my belief that
two of them were going

175
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
to be here today.
 

176
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Oh yes, look at that.
 

177
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There they are.
 

178
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I couldn't tell, they looked
so young like undergraduates.

179
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Why don't you
introduce yourselves?

180
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:34,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

181
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
PROFESSOR: When you read the
syllabus, you will discover

182
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
useful things like their
names, again, and

183
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
their email contacts.
 

184
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
And also useful thoughts like,
3 am the day before it's due is

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
not the time you want to send a
panicked note saying, I can't

186
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
get started on my paper.
 

187
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Think about it ahead of time
and they will be useful.

188
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Also useful to you will be, we
will have a series of workshops

189
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
in the library for how to do
research for these

190
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
sorts of papers.
 

191
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And details about that will
emerge later on in the term.

192
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But I would strongly encourage
people to go to one

193
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
of those sessions.
 

194
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Because doing research for
college-level papers in a

195
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
course like this is different
than what you did in high

196
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
school, probably, and it's
certainly different than

197
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
feeding the keywords for
whatever topic you're writing

198
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
about into Google and
calling it a day.

199
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You laugh, but some people
did that last year.

200
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It was not a pleasant sight.
 

201
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,000
OK.
 

202
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I think that people are
done with this exciting

203
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
form, don't you?
 

204
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 
 

205
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
She wants them passed
to the center aisle.

206
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 
 

207
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's very bad form to
rip up the paper of

208
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
the guy next to you.
 

209
00:12:57,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 
 

210
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
OK, are there any of those
forms still out there?

211
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 
 

212
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,000
All right.
 

213
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Now that we've done the really
exciting part, let's try

214
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
saying something about
what this course is about.

215
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And why you bothered to try to
get yourself lotteried in.

216
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Many, many, many many
-- any other forms?

217
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Last chance.
 

218
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Many many, many many MIT
courses are of the form, so

219
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
when you go to the first
class you get the syllabus.

220
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You look at the list of topics.
 

221
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You say, I don't know anything
about these topics but I sure

222
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
hope that by the end of the
course I know something

223
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
about these topics.
 

224
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And Intro Psych class is
different from that.

225
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Because if you take a look at
the list of topics in the

226
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
course, which you can find by
the way on the back page of the

227
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
syllabus but you don't need to
go looking for it right now,

228
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,000
you will discover memory,
learning, cognition, emotion,

229
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
personality, intelligence, a
whole set of topics that you

230
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
already have some notion about.
 

231
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
They're terms that you
use in everyday speech.

232
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That you can converse
about perfectly happily.

233
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The job of this course is to
dig behind the, what you

234
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
would know in what's
known as folk psychology.

235
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Folk psychology is a term
coined in the 19th century

236
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
to refer to the psychology
that folk know.

237
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
As opposed to the psychology
that one would learn in the

238
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
academy, like you are here.
 

239
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
What we used to say, actually,
when the term was defined for

240
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
me in graduate school, I think
somebody said, folk psychology,

241
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
that's the psychology that
your grandmother knows.

242
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That doesn't work so well.
 

243
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Because your grandmother
may well have a Ph.D in

244
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
psychology these days.
 

245
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Folk psychology is what the
psychology that you would

246
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
know without bothering to
take a course like this.

247
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The psychology you just
pick up on the street.

248
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
This course is designed
to go beyond that.

249
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Well, let me dig up an example.
 

250
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Let me close the door.
 

251
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And so, as an example, I
could assert oh, let's

252
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
see, I need a person.
 

253
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Well, this is why one
sits in the front.

254
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're a person.
 

255
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's very good.
 

256
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What's your name?
 

257
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

258
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,000
PROFESSOR: You're Mark.
 

259
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
OK.
 

260
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Who is that woman
sitting next to you?

261
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
This is Laura.
 

262
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
OK.
 

263
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I could say that
Mark loves Laura.

264
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It may or may not be true.
 

265
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
For all I know,
Mark, it is true.

266
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 
 

267
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Well, this is going to
be a more interesting

268
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
example then sometimes.
 

269
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But, all right.
 

270
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
If I assert that Mark loves
Laura without much knowledge of

271
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
either Mark or Laura here, you
had -- that's not a sentence

272
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
that's hard for you
to understand.

273
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
But what is it that we're
actually talking about?

274
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So, all right, what's love?
 

275
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I think, I didn't check, I was
going to check this morning

276
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
but I didn't check.
 

277
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I think that probably the line
you would get in a dictionary

278
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
would assert that love is an
emotion, and then it would go

279
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
on to describe what kind
of an emotion it is.

280
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But it's an odd emotion
if it is an emotion.

281
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
If you think about other
emotions that are pretty

282
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
straightforward.
 

283
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Let's say, sadness or
happiness to give two

284
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
straightforward examples.
 

285
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You know what sadness and
happiness feel like.

286
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
They have a distinctive
feeling to them

287
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
There is a distinctive
feeling to being in love.

288
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
There's no doubt that
there's a feeling.

289
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's actually an interesting
question why we use the same

290
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
word feeling to talk about
feeling in love, and

291
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
feeling the table.
 

292
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What's the commonality there?
 

293
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But the feeling of being in
love is not simple in the same

294
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
way that the feeling of sadness
of the feeling of happiness is.

295
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
For instance, you can be
sad or happy in love.

296
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You can be in love and the
experience of that could

297
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
be either sad or happy.
 

298
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The experience of being
sad cannot be either

299
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
sad or -- sad is sad.
 

300
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's, in some sense, an atomic
sensation in a way that

301
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
love does not appear to be.
 

302
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You can wake up in the
morning feeling sad.

303
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Disembodied sort of sadness.
 

304
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Or disembodied sort
of happiness.

305
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You can't really, it's hard to
imagine what it would be to

306
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
wake up and say I feel love.
 

307
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's not clear that that makes
sort of a quasi-religious sense

308
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
that you could get to it.
 

309
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I feel love for the
whole universe, or

310
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
something like that.
 

311
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's lovely, but, you
see the distinction.

312
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So maybe it's not an emotion
in the simple sense that

313
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
sadness or happiness is.
 

314
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Maybe it's a way of thinking
about your current state.

315
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You know, I feel happy and my
heart is pounding and I'm

316
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
sitting next to, oh God I've
forgotten her name already.

317
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Laura.
 

318
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Lara.
 

319
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
No U.
 

320
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
L-A-R-A Lara.
 

321
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And Mark.
 

322
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
They both have two
letters in common.

323
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That's the basis for
this relationship.

324
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 
 

325
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Anyway, where was I?
 

326
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You're not going to wake
up feeling a disembodied

327
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
sense of love.
 

328
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Maybe maybe what it is is
a thought the state that

329
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
you are currently in.
 

330
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
So maybe it's a cognition
rather than an emotion.

331
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But if it's a cognition it's a
different kind of combination

332
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
from what you might think
of as, sort of, an

333
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
atomic cognition.
 

334
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Because it has this
aspect of feeling to it.

335
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That that cognitions don't,
what's the, capital

336
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
of Equatorial Guinea.
 

337
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I have no idea.
 

338
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
But it's a thought that, I
can think about that fact.

339
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It doesn't carry with it any
deep feeling unless it turns

340
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
out to be a question
on the final exam.

341
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But you can have thoughts
that aren't colored in this

342
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
emotional kind of a way.
 

343
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So it's not a simple cognition.
 

344
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It might be more useful to
call it a motivation than

345
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
to call it an emotion.
 

346
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Motivations are like emotions
in the sense that having this

347
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
affective, affect is the sort
of jargony term for feeling,

348
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
this affective component to it.
 

349
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
But the sorts of things that
get talked about as motivations

350
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
are things like thirst.
 

351
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So, it being warm, I'm thirsty.
 

352
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
That's a faintly unpleasant
state and a motivation is

353
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
something that motivates me
to do something to

354
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
change my state.
 

355
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And hunger is another
good example.

356
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So what kind of motivation
would love be?

357
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Love might be a motivation
that it's directed to

358
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
an object of some sort.
 

359
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And, I probably shouldn't have
caught that cold from the

360
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
third-grader in my house.
 

361
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 
 

362
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
That's better.
 

363
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's a motivation that, if love
is a motivation, what it's

364
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
motivating you to do is to
perhaps get closer, to possess

365
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
the object of desire.
 

366
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Now Mark and Lara are busy
sitting there saying, oh boy,

367
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
that doesn't sound so good.
 

368
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
But love, of course, can
be used not just in the

369
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Mark and Lara sense.
 

370
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
But you can love your laptop
or something like that.

371
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And have, we won't go
there, Mark, it's OK.

372
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
But those are two clearly
different senses of love.

373
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Or, at least your chortling
suggests that you think of

374
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
them in different senses.
 

375
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You might ask what love is for.
 

376
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
And the motive, if thirst is
a motivation, it's because

377
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
you need liquid in
order to be alive.

378
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
If you don't drink stuff
you're going to be dead.

379
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What's love for?
 

380
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Well, the usual answers to
that, these days in psychology,

381
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
would come out of the chunk of
psychology that's called

382
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
evolutionary psychology.
 

383
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
That sees these core
motivations, if you like, as

384
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
things that evolved over the
history of the species and of

385
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
life in general, to
serve useful purposes

386
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
for the organism.
 

387
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
In this case, love is
presumably in service of that

388
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
great evolutionary good which
is to get your genes into

389
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
the next generation.
 

390
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
That your goal, if you're a
thoroughgoing evolutionary

391
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
psychologist, your goal in life
basically is to get genes into

392
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
the next generation to
perpetuate your genes.

393
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And the sex and reproduction
thing is a good way to do that.

394
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It's not the only way to do
that, it's important to note.

395
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
How many of you are
only children?

396
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Well, actually, let's go
at it the other way.

397
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
How many of you have siblings?
 

398
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
OK.
 

399
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
One way for you to gain this
sort of evolutionary

400
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
immortality of getting your
genes into the next

401
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
generation is to be a really
good aunt or uncle.

402
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You protect and preserve that
little niece or nephew of

403
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
yours, and they're carrying a
bundle of your genes, too.

404
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
So it's not that having and
raising children is the only

405
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,000
evolutionary route
to the future.

406
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But it is a good one.
 

407
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
And the love of business would
seem to be related to that.

408
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
But it's not necessary.
 

409
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
If you think about it,
well, all right spider.

410
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Let's think of spiders.
 

411
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Spiders, the reproduction thing
works fine with spiders.

412
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
It's not clear how much
love and romance there

413
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
is involved here.
 

414
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
It's not clear for a
couple of reasons.

415
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
One of them is, it's very
unclear what's going on in the

416
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
mind of an animal in general.
 

417
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
You just don't have any access.
 

418
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
In fact, or at least, you
have only the barest

419
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
of influential access.
 

420
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
In fact, I don't have any
access to what's going

421
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
on inside your mind.
 

422
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
It is an assumption on my
part that you guys have

423
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
mental lives like mine.
 

424
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You could be what the
philosophers, what is, in

425
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
philosopher jargon, you
could all be zombies.

426
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Which, if you're doing
philosophy means, you're things

427
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
that look human, behave like
they're human, but aren't human

428
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
because there's nothing
happening in there.

429
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
There's no, you could be
cunningly designed machines.

430
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I don't know that, but it's
a useful assumption that

431
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
your mental life and my
mental are the similar.

432
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It is not a terribly useful
assumption that my mental

433
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
life and a spider's
mental life are similar.

434
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And in any case, if you look at
spider behavior, it doesn't

435
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
look much like romantic love.
 

436
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I mean, the guy spends most of
his time trying to avoid being

437
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
killed by the female spider,
who is typically much bigger.

438
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
He does a variety of
courtships, we'll talk about

439
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
this later in the term, but I
cannot resist, there are

440
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
variety of spider species where
the spider does engage in a lot

441
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
of courtship behavior.
 

442
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
The male spider, he
brings her presents.

443
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Like, he brings her a dead fly.
 

444
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,000
The reason he brings her a dead
fly is that she's busy chowing

445
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
down on the dead fly, she
doesn't bite his

446
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
little head off.
 

447
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And it's not
desperately romantic.

448
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
But, in any case, it does
work perfectly well

449
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
for reproduction.
 

450
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
It suggests that there might
be, even when you're talking

451
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
about love between potential
mates, that there might be a

452
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
distinction to be made between
love and, well, lust or some

453
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
sort of sex drive or
something like that.

454
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
There is evidence at a
neurochemical level that

455
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
these are distinct.
 

456
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
The chemical pathways in the
brain that are involved in

457
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
romantic love seem to be those
that are also involved in

458
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
parent-child bonds
of attachment.

459
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
They involve chemicals like,
well, your brain generates

460
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
opioid chemicals, which are
like opium, which is why opium

461
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
is a powerful drug when taken
externally, taken from

462
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
the from the outside.
 

463
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But in any case, the bonds of
love involve those chemicals.

464
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The bonds of lust involve
things like testosterone and

465
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
other androgens and estrogens
that they may have talked

466
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
about in endless length
in high school biology or

467
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
something of that sort.
 

468
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
But there's evidence that
these are separate.

469
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
How did they come together?
 

470
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Well, evolutionary
psychologists suggested the

471
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:03,000
link might be that if you bring
love to bear, this romantic

472
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:10,000
bonding, this attachment to
bear, then you've got pairs of

473
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
people who stick around.
 

474
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Stick to each other in ways
that are good for the begetting

475
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
and raising of children.
 

476
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,000
And that maybe this bonding
between parent and child got

477
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
co-opted into being
romantic love.

478
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Between potential mates.
 

479
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Another way of putting it would
be to say, well, maybe romantic

480
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,000
love exists because
straight-out, just regular old

481
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
lust, is not compatible
with civilization.

482
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,000
If people are just simply
acting on their evolutionarily

483
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
based desire to mate, it's
hard to run a civilization.

484
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It's hard to run a university,
for instance, because

485
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
people are busy.
 

486
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:02,000
So what you've got to do, what
you've got to do, is, if you're

487
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
going to run a civilization you
have to find some way to

488
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
channel that sex drive into
other activities so that the

489
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
rest of civilization
can keep going.

490
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Now, if you start talking in
those terms, you're talking in

491
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,000
terms that you will see are
very much like what Freud said.

492
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Freud argued that things like
romantic love are necessary in

493
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
order to have a civilization.
 

494
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
In the absence of, if
you're a spider you don't

495
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
need romantic love.
 

496
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
But you're also not going to
have, spider civilization

497
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
is somewhat more limited.
 

498
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Now, how does Lara know
that Mark loves her?

499
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Well, he said so.
 

500
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Right?
 

501
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Well, that's cool.
 

502
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
I can say so, too.
 

503
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Right?
 

504
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I love you.
 

505
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 
 

506
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I might even sort of, kind
of, mean it in this sort

507
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
of generic, I love all of
humanity kind of sense.

508
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
But it's obviously different.
 

509
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Now, there are various other
ways that he can be indicating

510
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
the fact that he is
in love with her.

511
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
But she's got to
figure this out.

512
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Is he really in love with me,
or is he just kind of, actually

513
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
he's got to figure it out too.
 

514
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Am I really in love with her?
 

515
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Her active perception is, it
would be perfectly possible

516
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
for her to be wrong.
 

517
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
She looks at him, she thinks,
he's in love with me.

518
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
And he's thinking, I'm not in
love with her, I'm just faking.

519
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Could be.
 

520
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Now, could it go the other way?
 

521
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Could he be thinking,
I'm in love with her,

522
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
and it not be true?
 

523
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Is that logically possible?
 

524
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Now, and who can tell you
that it wasn't true?

525
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Your mother?
 

526
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You don't really love her.
 

527
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Well, you probably wouldn't
buy that any more.

528
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
But you would have once.
 

529
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:11,000
If you plot, let's see, how
are we going to do this?

530
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,000
All right.
 

531
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Well, this is age.
 

532
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I know this axis is age.
 

533
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
So if you plot the percentage
of people who say, you

534
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
ask kids, who knows your
inner emotions the best?

535
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
You or, give an open-ended
question but the real

536
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
categories are you
or Mom and Dad.

537
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:40,000
It turns out, so, if this is
you and this is Mom and Dad,

538
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:49,000
that function crosses the 50%
point at the surprisingly late

539
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
age of early adolescence.
 

540
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Before that, the majority of
kids will assert that Mom and

541
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Dad know their emotions better
than they themselves know it.

542
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
How could that be the case?
 

543
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Well, it's hard to get yourself
back into that mental

544
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
state at this point.
 

545
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,000
It gets easier again once you
have kids of your own, because

546
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
you're looking at your kid.
 

547
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And you're, like, your
four year old kid.

548
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And your kids doing, and you
say, gotta go to the bathroom.

549
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
No, I don't gotta go
to the bathroom.

550
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
You gotta go to the bathroom.
 

551
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Nuh-uh, I don't have to
go to the bathroom.

552
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
You sure you don't have
to go to the bathroom?

553
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
No, no, OK, I guess you don't
have to go to the bathroom,

554
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,000
let's all get in the car.
 

555
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I've got to go to the bathroom.
 

556
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And so, if the kid is a little
self-reflective he thinks, hey,

557
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
wait a minute, first of all not
only do I have to go to the

558
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
bathroom, but you know Mom and
Dad, they, like, knew

559
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
that before I did.
 

560
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
That's cool.
 

561
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,000
That's also a little scary
because I thought a whole

562
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
bunch of other things.
 

563
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I wonder if they know
those things too.

564
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Eventually, you figure out, no,
they didn't know that stuff.

565
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Which is just as well
for all concerned.

566
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:07,000
But returning to the love
example the point is

567
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
that you need to know.
 

568
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
You need to perform an
active perception to decide

569
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
somebody else loves you.
 

570
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,000
And you need to do an active
sort of self-perception to

571
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
decide that you love
somebody else.

572
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You might also ask yourself
at that point, well, what

573
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
is it that you love?
 

574
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Physical attributes?
 

575
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
That's considered
sort of crass.

576
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
And even worse would be to
say, I love her for her

577
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
money and possessions.
 

578
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
That sounds terrible.
 

579
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,000
But if you ask yourself, what
are you watching on TV, there's

580
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,000
a continuous pairing of love,
sex, and cars, soda,

581
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
anything, right?
 

582
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 
 

583
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Well, I can't think of any
particular ads at the

584
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
moment because I don't
watch enough TV.

585
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I'll ask my kids if there
are any good sex and soda

586
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
ads on at the moment.
 

587
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
But there certainly have been.
 

588
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
In any case, typically,
we say things like, I

589
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
love her for her mind.
 

590
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Or something like that.
 

591
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Now, you could love your
laptop for its mind, too.

592
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It doesn't seem to be
quite the same thing.

593
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Now, all right.
 

594
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
So, the question of what it
is that you might love.

595
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Where is that love, if in you?
 

596
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Does that question make
any sort of sense?

597
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Well, there's a traditional
answer to that.

598
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:39,000
If you asked where love lives,
the sort of conventional,

599
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
out-there in several hundred
years ago, probably

600
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
would be simpler.
 

601
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Kind of answer would be, heart?
 

602
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Well, yeah.
 

603
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Liver is good too but that's
only if you're, the cool white

604
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
virgin snows upon my heart have
abated the ardor of my liver,

605
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
says the prince guy in
Shakespeare's Tempest.

606
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
There's this notion, very
much a folk psychological

607
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
notion, that emotions are
resident in the viscera.

608
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And that makes a
degree of sense.

609
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Because, when you see the
object of your heart's desire,

610
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
you know it's your heart's
desire because your heart

611
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
goes thump, thump, thump.
 

612
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Right?
 

613
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Now, you think that if love is
localized, if there is some

614
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,000
chunk of you that is your love
for whoever this significant

615
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
other might be, where's
that likely to be?

616
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Brain, somebody
muttered up there.

617
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Yeah, it's probably
in your brain.

618
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
You can imagine why that was
a hard notion to come by.

619
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Because you look at the object
of your desire and you don't

620
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
suddenly say, aah, my head.
 

621
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And you probably won't
be sending brain-shaped

622
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
chocolates to anybody at
Valentine's Day either.

623
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 
 

624
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
But it is an interesting
question to ask, whether or

625
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
not, all right brain maybe.
 

626
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Is it localized enough that
there's some little piece of

627
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
brain that we could go to
and say, Mark's love

628
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
for Lara is there.
 

629
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,000
And if we went in and pulled
that board out of his computer,

630
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
that he'd know who Lara was, he
knew everything else, they just

631
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
wouldn't be in love any more.
 

632
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Is that level of
localization plausible?

633
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Is the love normal?
 

634
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Is his love, Mark loves
Lara for her mind.

635
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Is that normal?
 

636
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Suppose he loved
her for her foot?

637
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Would that be normal?
 

638
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,000
What's the difference?
 

639
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Why would one be -- and if it
wasn't normal, who gets to

640
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
decide that it's normal?
 

641
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Do we, as a community,
get to decide?

642
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Does the family get to decide?
 

643
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Is there some objective way
to decide whether something

644
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
is or is not normal?
 

645
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And if it's not normal, what
do we get to do about it?

646
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Do we get to, if it's not
normal, would drugs fix it?

647
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Would surgery fix it?
 

648
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Would some sort of
therapy fix it?

649
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
You can see what's
going on here.

650
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
From a simple sort of statement
like, you know, Mark loves

651
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Lara, we can get to,
essentially, any of the topics

652
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
that will show up in
a course like this.

653
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And you could have done, we
wouldn't have had to use love

654
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
as the particular example.
 

655
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Behind any of these things that
we use perfectly comfortably in

656
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,000
everyday life is a large set of
very interesting questions,

657
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
only a very few of which, of
course, I can manage to address

658
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
in an introductory-level
course.

659
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:01,000
But the goal here would be to
give you some sort of overview

660
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,000
of the sorts of topics and the
sorts of answers that modern

661
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,000
academic psychology
has come up with.

662
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:16,000
The way that we do that
is through lectures.

663
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Through recitations,
which should not be

664
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
treated as optional.
 

665
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
We expect you to be there.
 

666
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
They're not just like reviews
for the exam, or there are no

667
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
problems in an introductory
psych class the way there would

668
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
be in chemistry or something.
 

669
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
you're expected to be there.
 

670
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
They're an integral
part of the course.

671
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
And there's the textbook.
 

672
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
It's a good idea to look at it.
 

673
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I won't go into a lot
more detail about the

674
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
mechanics of the course.
 

675
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
The syllabus will tell you most
of what you want to know.

676
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And it's a really good idea to
actually take a look at the

677
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
syllabus and to take a look
at the writing assignments.

678
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Because they have due dates
attached to them, and

679
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,000
things like that.
 

680
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I will answer any blazingly
mechanical questions about the

681
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
course, if they have occurred
to anybody at the moment.

682
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Otherwise I will plunge into
the brain in a moment.

683
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
 
 

684
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
After satisfying my first
motivation yet more.

685
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
 
 

686
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:29,000
OK, let me say that the sort of
ideological grounding of this

687
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,000
course is that the course, like
academic psychology generally,

688
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
is materialist in its ideology.
 

689
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
What does that mean?
 

690
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,000
What that means is that the
mind is what the brain does.

691
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,000
And that if you have thoughts,
if you have feelings.

692
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
If you have memories,
that these things arise

693
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
out of the brain.
 

694
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
This is not to say they're
necessarily, if we wanted to

695
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
teach a straight neuroscience
course we'd just teach

696
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
you about the brain.
 

697
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:14,000
But it is to say that it is in
distinction to another old

698
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
philosophical position.
 

699
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Which is dualism.
 

700
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Which says that the mind
is somehow an immaterial

701
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
something that is
separate from the brain.

702
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It interacts with you, it
interacts with your body,

703
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
but it is separate.
 

704
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
The reason for talking about
the brain for this lecture and

705
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
a chunk of the next lecture is
this notion that the mind

706
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
is what the brain does.
 

707
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
And, well, if we want
to find out what the

708
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
brain does, let's see.
 

709
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
We could make a little
bit of a list here.

710
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
You go up.
 

711
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Gotta get rid of a little
more of whatever that was.

712
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
 
 

713
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
So, do I have a copy of the
handout here somewhere?

714
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Yes.
 

715
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,000
OK.
 

716
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
So I can ask because it just
has for broad classes of

717
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,000
methods on the handout,
without describing them.

718
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
How might we go about finding
out what the brain does?

719
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Oh, this reminds me to say,
anytime during the course of

720
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
the term, if you've got a
question, comment, or whatever,

721
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
feel free to raise your hand.
 

722
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,000
And I will attempt
to answer it.

723
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
If I think we're being
hopelessly you diverted from

724
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
where I think we need to get
in the lecture, I may have

725
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
to cut off discussion.
 

726
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
But I'm more than happy
to have the opportunity.

727
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
So don't, just because it's a
great big lecture, don't feel

728
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,000
that you've just got to sit
there and not do anything

729
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
interactive like
raise your hand.

730
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Of course, if you raise your
hand you might end up exposing

731
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
the details of your romantic
engagements with the person

732
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
sitting next to you, but that's
a risk you have to take.

733
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Anyway.
 

734
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
If you wanted to find out how
the brain worked, what the

735
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
brain did, how could we
go about doing that?

736
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
Anybody got -- Yes?
 

737
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

738
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
PROFESSOR: You could cut the
brain open and look at it.

739
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
OK, that's Option 0
on my list of 1-4.

740
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:20,000
 
 

741
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Not because it's trivial in any
sense, but I'm looking for

742
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
techniques that get more at the
function than at the structure.

743
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
But there is a certain amount
that you do learn from just

744
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
looking at the structure.
 

745
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
In, fact, Descartes, one of the
founders of the dualist view,

746
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
looked at the anatomy of the
brain, thought, if the

747
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
immaterial mind and soul are
interacting with the brain,

748
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
well, the brain is a
double structure, right?

749
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,000
It's got these two, sort of,
symmetrical hemispheres.

750
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,000
That interaction between the
immaterial soul and the

751
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
body must be at one point.
 

752
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
He looked at the anatomy, saw
the pineal gland, which is a

753
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
piece of brain lying on the
mid-line and thought, because

754
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
there's only one of those,
that must be the point.

755
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
So, you can make inferences
from structure alone.

756
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
That particular inference is
wrong, but you could do it.

757
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Yes, the person in front there.
 

758
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Yes, you.
 

759
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

760
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,000
PROFESSOR: OK, MRI.
 

761
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
We will make that into
the larger category of

762
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,000
imaging techniques.
 

763
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 
 

764
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,000
For psych purposes, the most
dramatic version of this is

765
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
so-called FMRI, for Functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

766
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,000
This is the new entry
on the list, really.

767
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Remarkable breakthrough in the
time that I've been teaching

768
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
this course is the ability to
now look at the structure and

769
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
some aspects of the function of
the brain in intact, you know,

770
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
a wide awake human beings.
 

771
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
You simply couldn't
do that any more.

772
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
And that's a remarkable --
well, it's a remarkable boom

773
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:04,000
for psychology and a huge
advance for medicine.

774
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
So, for instance, if
you had a brain tumor.

775
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,000
There are symptoms of
having a brain tumor.

776
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
But the only way to find out
if you actually had a tumor,

777
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,000
because you want to take this
tumor out if you could, the

778
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:21,000
only way to find out, a
generation ago was to do

779
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
exploratory surgery.
 

780
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
And open up the brain and
see where the thing was.

781
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Now you'd be in an MR scanner
by the end of the day.

782
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
And we'd know.
 

783
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,000
So, yes, very useful technique.
 

784
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
You're going to offer
me another one?

785
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

786
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:41,000
PROFESSOR: OK.
 

787
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,000
So we'll put this under
the category of lesions.

788
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Brain damage.
 

789
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
If this is the newest, this
is probably the oldest

790
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
of the basic techniques.
 

791
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:01,000
If you damage brains in
the same way, you end up

792
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,000
getting symptoms that are
similar across people.

793
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,000
And even across species,
in many cases.

794
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
And that is a tipoff that,
first of all, the brain

795
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
has something to do
with mental life.

796
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And that specific bits of brain
have specific things to do with

797
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
specific aspects
of mental life.

798
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:28,000
The real advances in this sort
of research, and this sort of

799
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
understanding of the brain,
came, I guess, mid- to late

800
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,000
nineteenth century, with
advances both in medicine and

801
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,000
in, I suppose, what you could
call military technology.

802
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,000
In earlier times, if you got a
penetrating wound to the brain,

803
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
odds were that you were
simply going to be dead.

804
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
But by the mid- to late
nineteenth century, people were

805
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
surviving with penetrating
brain injuries.

806
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:06,000
And it became clear -- and
bullets could be leaving

807
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,000
comparatively small lesions.
 

808
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
And so it became increasingly
clear that different bits

809
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
of brain damage did
different things.

810
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Let me find myself a place to
draw another picture here.

811
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I need a brain.
 

812
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
 
 

813
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
So, here we go.
 

814
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,000
One quick, this is your brain.
 

815
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Just to orient things here.
 

816
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
 
 

817
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
OK, so.
 

818
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Front, back, bottom, top.
 

819
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
If I'm facing that way, this
would be looking at the outside

820
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
surface of the left hemisphere.
 

821
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
You've got two cerebral
hemispheres, about this size,

822
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
stuck inside your head.
 

823
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
 
 

824
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
The brain's got
lots of wrinkles.

825
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
There are a couple of large
ones that I'm drawing

826
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
here for my purposes.
 

827
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Because the cerebral
hemispheres are conventionally

828
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,000
divided up into four lobes.
 

829
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
The terms for which are written
on the handouts, so I will just

830
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
give you the initials rather
than writing out

831
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
the whole thing.
 

832
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Conveniently, the frontal
lobe is at the front.

833
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
After that, you just simply
have to learn them.

834
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Temporal lobe down
at the bottom.

835
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Occipital lobe at the back.
 

836
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And the parietal lobe on the
other side of this big central

837
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
sulcus that divides the frontal
from the parietal lobe.

838
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
What was found, I think
originally in the

839
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Franco-Prussian War,
if memory serves.

840
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:47,000
1870s, was that if you got
lesions to the back of the

841
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
brain here, to the cortex,
the wrinkled outside

842
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
surface is known as cortex.
 

843
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
That's from the Latin
word for cork.

844
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Which is what anatomists
thought it looked like.

845
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
If you get lesions back
here, you get problems

846
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
with your vision.
 

847
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Very specifically.
 

848
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
And, if you got a great big
lesion that took out the entire

849
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
occipital cortex on both sides,
you'd be functionally blind.

850
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
But if you got a small lesion,
let's say in the left

851
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
hemisphere, you would have a
small region of blindness.

852
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,000
And it would always be on the
right side of the visual world.

853
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,000
And that's relative to where
you're actually looking.

854
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Fixating at the moment.
 

855
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:37,000
So, if I fixate on this guy
there, who I'm now staring at,

856
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
then if I had a lesion in my
left hemisphere some region

857
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
out here, I would be blind.
 

858
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
If the lesion was in my right
hemisphere the blind region

859
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,000
would be on the opposite
side, on the left.

860
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
That's the sort of thing
that you could discover

861
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
from lesion studies.
 

862
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And so, lesions happen when you
get brain injury from a bullet.

863
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Lesions happen from strokes.
 

864
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:09,000
One of the great advantages to
imaging technologies is that in

865
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
the 1870s, or even until quite
recently, the only way you knew

866
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
about where the lesion exactly
was, was if the patient

867
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
died and came to autopsy.
 

868
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
You could look at the brain,
and look at what was damaged.

869
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Now you can look at that brain
in an intact individual and see

870
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:32,000
where the damage might be.
 

871
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
So, damage to the brain can
tell you something about.

872
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
It's got the drawback that
you're trying to infer normal

873
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
function from an abnormal
brain at that point.

874
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,000
And that's not perfectly
straightforward.

875
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
But it does provide, and is
perhaps the oldest technique

876
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
for providing lots
of information.

877
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Yes, you were about to
give me another method?

878
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

879
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
PROFESSOR: OK, behavior
is item, that's 0, than

880
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,000
behavior is going to be 5.
 

881
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
And we'll spend an awful
lot of the course talking

882
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
about behavioral measures.
 

883
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,000
But in behavior, without going
in and doing something with the

884
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
tissue of the brain, you're
essentially treating the

885
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
brain as a black box.
 

886
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,000
At that point.
 

887
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
It may tell you something
about the brain in connection

888
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:23,000
with the rest of this.
 

889
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
But we're looking for
techniques that are

890
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
specifically about
studying brain itself.

891
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Yes?
 

892
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

893
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
PROFESSOR: [? Wake ?]
 

894
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
surgery?
 

895
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

896
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
PROFESSOR: This
just sounds cool.

897
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
 
 

898
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Keep going on.
 

899
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
What did you have in --
 

900
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:57,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

901
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
PROFESSOR: What's
the surgery part?

902
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

903
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
PROFESSOR: I'm just trying to
see if there's a 6 here that

904
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I'm just not thinking of.
 

905
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
That would be cool.
 

906
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Otherwise I can sort of --
 

907
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

908
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah, actually.
 

909
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
That's one I didn't
put in, typically.

910
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Which is that you can go and
start infusing stuff into,

911
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,000
chemicals into, the brain.
 

912
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,000
And changing behavior.
 

913
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Do I want to say anything more
about that at the moment?

914
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Good, I'll use that one.
 

915
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Thank you.
 

916
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
We'll call this
stimulation in general.

917
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Stimulation.
 

918
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
 
 

919
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,000
You can go in and
stimulate brain.

920
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
So, I was going to do that
and segue from the chemical

921
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
stimulation to electrical
stimulation, but you

922
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
got there for me.
 

923
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
You can go in and stimulate the
brain electrically in rats.

924
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
But you can also do
this in humans.

925
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:13,000
In fact, so back in the 1950s,
Wilder Penfield, psychologist

926
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
who's working with some
neurosurgeons up in Montreal.

927
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:24,000
And what they were doing was,
they were doing neurosurgery

928
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
on patients with
intractable epilepsy.

929
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Epilepsy is an electrical storm
in the brain, basically.

930
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:42,000
And often is started by a piece
of abnormal or damaged tissue

931
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
that acts as a generator.
 

932
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
And then what happens is a sort
of an abnormal electrical

933
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
activity spreads from that
point of generation across the

934
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
brain or across some
chunk of the brain.

935
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And causes a seizure or
lapse of awareness.

936
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
The sort of symptoms that
you get in epilepsy.

937
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Often, this is
controllable by drugs.

938
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
But in some cases it's not.
 

939
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,000
And one of the treatments that
can be tried is to go in

940
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
and try to lesion this
little chunk of brain.

941
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:14,000
If you take out the generator
you can often reduce the

942
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,000
severity or eliminate
the seizures.

943
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
But if you're going to take
brain tissue out, you

944
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
gotta be really careful.
 

945
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Because, well, actually
where I put this is a

946
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
pretty good example.
 

947
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
We knew from lesion studies
going back, again, into the

948
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:39,000
nineteenth century, that areas
around here that go by names

949
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,000
like Broca and Wernicke's area,
which are the names of 19th

950
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
century neurologists, actually.
 

951
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Vitally important in
the production and

952
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
understanding of language.
 

953
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,000
If you are right-handed, those
areas exist in the left

954
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
hemisphere of the brain.
 

955
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,000
So this is a left
hemisphere the brain.

956
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
That'll work fine.
 

957
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
And if they're damaged by
stroke, you will have trouble

958
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
with understanding language or
producing language, or both.

959
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Depends on the exact
nature of the.

960
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Stroke But very bad
lesions to have.

961
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:24,000
So, if you were to discover
that the epileptogenic focus,

962
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:28,000
the piece of bad tissue, was
sitting in there, you would

963
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
say, look, I'm sorry.
 

964
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
We don't want to
do this surgery.

965
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Because while I could perhaps
reduce the frequency of your

966
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,000
seizures, it's going to
mean that you've got real

967
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
problems with language.
 

968
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
And that tradeoff
is not worth it.

969
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,000
On the other hand, if the
generator was here, I can

970
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
reduce the frequency
of your seizures.

971
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
And you'll have a relatively
small area of blindness out

972
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
in the right visual
field somewhere.

973
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Say, look, I'm not thrilled
about being blind in some

974
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
part of my visual field.
 

975
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
But that tradeoff is worth it.
 

976
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
So you need to know where you
are in the brain in order

977
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
to do this sort of surgery.
 

978
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And what Penfield did was
to stimulate the brain

979
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
of awake individuals.
 

980
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
In effect, to ask, what's
this bit of brain doing.

981
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Now, how can you do that?
 

982
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Doesn't that kind
of hurt a lot?

983
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,000
The answer is that they're
under local anesthetic to get

984
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
through the skull and the outer
surface, the membranes across

985
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
the surface of the brain.
 

986
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Because, in case you hadn't
noticed, digging holes with

987
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,000
a sharp stick in your
skull really hurts.

988
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
But once you get to brain,
there are no pain receptors

989
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
in the brain itself.
 

990
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
There's nothing.
 

991
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Once you've got the brain
exposed, you can do anything

992
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
you want to the brain.
 

993
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And the brain won't
particularly complain.

994
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
I don't suggest you try this.
 

995
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
But you could.
 

996
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Now, let's step back.
 

997
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Why have pain receptors at all?
 

998
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
What's pain good for?
 

999
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Yeah.
 

1000
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:22,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

1001
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
PROFESSOR: Pain's there to keep
you from hurting yourself.

1002
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
If you don't have pain, and
your hand's on the hot stove,

1003
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
you say, oh, I'm cooking my
hand that's no big deal.

1004
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
In fact, there rare cases of
people who are congenitally

1005
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
insensitive to pain.
 

1006
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
And it's bad news.
 

1007
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
They end up injuring
themselves.

1008
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
That being the case, why
not have pain receptors

1009
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
in your Brain Yeah.
 

1010
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

1011
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
PROFESSOR: Yeah by the time
-- if you're thinking in

1012
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
evolutionary terms, by the time
the bear is chewing on your

1013
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,000
brain, you might as well just
kind of go with the experience.

1014
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Because it's not going
to matter much.

1015
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
So, the advantage here is
that you can go in and

1016
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
stimulate brain tissue.
 

1017
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
And it's a somewhat, from
the sound of it, somewhat

1018
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,000
uncanny experience.
 

1019
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
But it's not an
unpleasant experience.

1020
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
And so, all right, so what
Penfield did, stick a little

1021
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
electrode, say, here.
 

1022
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
And put a little
electrical current there.

1023
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
And what the patient would
report, if it was here, this

1024
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
is to the parietal side of
this big central sulcus.

1025
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:34,000
What the patient would
report is is, it feels like

1026
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
you're touching my foot.
 

1027
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,000
OK.
 

1028
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Move the electrode
a little bit.

1029
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
OK, now it feels like you're
sort of touching me in

1030
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,000
the middle of my back.
 

1031
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Now it feels like you're
touching my hand.

1032
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
It's the end of my nose.
 

1033
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,000
And what Penfield found was
that the surface of the body

1034
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
was laid out across the
surface of the brain.

1035
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
And the left hemisphere would
actually be the surface of

1036
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
the right side of the body.
 

1037
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,000
 
 

1038
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I don't know what that is
And it is feet up, head

1039
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
down, as I recall.
 

1040
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
But that chunk of brain which
is called somatosensory cortex,

1041
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:22,000
the term's on the handout
somewhere, represents the

1042
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
sensations coming
from the skin.

1043
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Now, I haven't drawn a terribly
realistic picture here.

1044
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,000
But the actual map is
hugely distorted.

1045
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
yes?
 

1046
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Is something -- OK.
 

1047
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I'll do that.
 

1048
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Pay no attention to the
man behind the curtain.

1049
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Anyway.
 

1050
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
So this map, known as
the homunculus, for the

1051
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
little man in the head.
 

1052
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,000
The sensory homunculus,
specifically.

1053
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
It's massively distorted.
 

1054
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Some chunks of your skin are
heavily over-represented

1055
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
in the brain.
 

1056
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Some are heavily
underrepresented.

1057
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
So what's over-represented?
 

1058
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
 
 

1059
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Hands.
 

1060
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
And?
 

1061
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Face.
 

1062
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
And on the face.
 

1063
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Lips.
 

1064
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Lips and tongue and
things like that.

1065
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:16,000
So, somewhere in Gleitman, a
chapter you'll read tonight

1066
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
with luck, there's a picture.
 

1067
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
People love making little
models of the homunculus.

1068
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
So you project it back out into
the world, and what would

1069
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,000
it look like if this
was a 1:1 mapping.

1070
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:32,000
And you get this guy with you
huge lips and huge hands,

1071
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,000
and a little tiny back.
 

1072
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
And the way to get a feeling
for this is to ask yourself, if

1073
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:42,000
you were trying to figure out
what something felt like, how

1074
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
would you go about doing that?
 

1075
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Well, you would go and
explore it with your hands.

1076
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
A little kid, less restrained
than you, would also probably

1077
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
put it in its mouth
and feel it that way.

1078
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
What would you wouldn't do is
rub it against your back,

1079
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
or something like that.
 

1080
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Because it's the hands and the
lips and stuff that have the

1081
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,000
very dense sensory
skin receptors.

1082
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
And it's sparser on your back.
 

1083
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Now, you will also, you can
test the prudery already of

1084
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,000
your introductory psych text
by checking out whether the

1085
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,000
homunculus is anatomically lee.
 

1086
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Correct The genitalia are
well represented in the

1087
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
sensory homunculus also.
 

1088
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
My recollection is that they
are well represented in

1089
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,000
Gleitman there are texts where
it's kind of -- Actually,

1090
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:36,000
there's one great version where
the homunculus is wearing,

1091
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
like, a little towel.
 

1092
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I've seen that once.
 

1093
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
That was cute.
 

1094
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:48,000
So stimulate here and the
person feels like you're

1095
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,000
touching them on their skin.
 

1096
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
If you go around to the right
hemisphere, they'd feel

1097
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
the stimulation down the
left side of the body.

1098
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Go to the other side of this,
into the frontal lobe, and

1099
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,000
instead of saying, oh, I feel
like you're touching my

1100
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:07,000
leg, the leg would twitch.
 

1101
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Left hemisphere, right leg.
 

1102
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
You move a little further
the arm would twitch.

1103
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Or just one muscle in the
arm, or something like that.

1104
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Here you've got a motor
homunculus, laid out

1105
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,000
across the motor cortex.
 

1106
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
And this chunk of the brain is
important in the generation

1107
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
of voluntary movements.
 

1108
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Again, it's a distorted map.
 

1109
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Hands, very over-represented.
 

1110
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
If you're a monkey, feet
are very over-represented.

1111
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
But you, who cannot hang upside
down from a tree by your feet

1112
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:39,000
or your tail or whatever, your
feet are comparatively

1113
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
impoverished in their
representation.

1114
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Tongue and vocal apparatus,
heavily over-represented.

1115
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
So, same sort of story.
 

1116
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Sensory and motor.
 

1117
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Now, these days, you don't even
need to go and cut open the

1118
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
skull to do this sort of thing.
 

1119
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
 
 

1120
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Transcranial magnetic
stimulation, or TMS, for short,

1121
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
involves generating a large
magnetic field close

1122
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
to the skull.
 

1123
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
As your physics background
will tell you, that generates

1124
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
an electrical field.
 

1125
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
If you shape the magnetic field
right, you can generate an

1126
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
electrical field in
the brain tissue.

1127
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
And, basically, produce the
same sort of brain stimulation

1128
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:29,000
that Penfield was producing
in an open skull.

1129
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:30,000
With the same results.
 

1130
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Nancy Kanwisher, who's a
professor in the department

1131
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
here, used to be up at Harvard.
 

1132
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Got on the front of the Harvard
Gazette for teaching her intro

1133
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:47,000
class with a TMS simulator in
hand and say, want to see

1134
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:51,000
where my motor cortex is?
 

1135
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Pow.
 

1136
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Pow.
 

1137
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
No, I'm not going
to do that, sorry.

1138
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
The reason I'm not going
to do that, by the

1139
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
way, is I'm a chicken.
 

1140
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
TMS is almost undoubtedly safe.
 

1141
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Lots of people do it.
 

1142
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,000
But it sounds too much like
things that I learned about

1143
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,000
when I was taking intro psych,
that were used to generate

1144
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,000
epileptic foci in rats.
 

1145
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Let's stimulate, pow, pow,
pow, pow, and now the

1146
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
rat's got epilepsy.
 

1147
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
It doesn't seem to happen
in TMS, but I'm a chicken.

1148
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
When it comes to my brain.
 

1149
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Yes?
 

1150
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:40,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

1151
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
PROFESSOR: Well, we'll find out
if I can spell homunculus.

1152
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
 
 

1153
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Paul, is it a U or an O?
 

1154
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
U?
 

1155
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Ho-munc-u-lus.
 

1156
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,000
One of the reasons for
handouts, by the way, is so

1157
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,000
that when people ask me can
I please spell it, it's on

1158
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
the handout somewhere.
 

1159
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Because the answer's
no I can't.

1160
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
So the homunculus, probably
derived from the Latin for a

1161
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
little man in the head, and
I apologize to the women.

1162
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I was trying to figure out
today what the little woman

1163
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
in the head would be.
 

1164
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:17,000
But my Latin has waned since
I took it in college.

1165
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Maybe it's the femunculus,
I'm not sure.

1166
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,000
But, in any case,
that's the homunculus.

1167
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
 
 

1168
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:35,000
So, that's stimulation
techniques.

1169
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I'm shopping for one more
useful technique here.

1170
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Anybody care to offer me
another technique for

1171
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
figuring out what's
going on in the brain?

1172
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

1173
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
PROFESSOR: Case studies are
typically these lesion studies.

1174
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Somebody has something
wrong with them.

1175
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
And we try to figure out
what's wrong with them.

1176
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
That goes way back, by the way.
 

1177
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:05,000
The early efforts to figure out
what bits of brain did come

1178
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:11,000
from the phrenologists,
early 19th century.

1179
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Phrenology.
 

1180
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
 
 

1181
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
If you know anything about
phrenology, you learned it

1182
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
from the Cartoon Network.
 

1183
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Because you watched Bugs Bunny
beat Elmer Fudd over the head.

1184
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:29,000
And then the bumps showed
up and you felt the bumps.

1185
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Looking at me like,
what's he talking about.

1186
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Or you know it because there's
a wide, any of these umpteen

1187
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
cartoons or sculptures where
you have a head that's got

1188
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
little functions all over it.
 

1189
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Good, somebody remembers it.
 

1190
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:51,000
I'm not just making
up weird stuff.

1191
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
The phrenologists believed that
the shape of the skull

1192
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:00,000
reflected the underlying shape
of the brain, that bigger

1193
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
meant more of that
particular function.

1194
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Which is rather like this.
 

1195
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I mean, it's not a completely
wacko assumption.

1196
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,000
And they then used a case study
system to try to figure out

1197
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
what different parts
of the brain did.

1198
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,000
So if you wanted to know where
criminality was in the brain,

1199
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
you go and find yourself
some criminals.

1200
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
And check where they got
big chunks of their brain.

1201
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
And that's where those
sort of maps came from.

1202
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,000
It's a rather ad hoc sounding
kind of process, now.

1203
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,000
So, amativeness, lust, is
typically located back here.

1204
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
The reason it's located back
here is because Spurzheim, one

1205
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:44,000
of the founders of phrenology,
had in his care a, how did he

1206
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
describe it, I think
she's described as

1207
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
a passionate widow.
 

1208
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,000
And every time Spurzheim put
her his hand on the back of

1209
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
her neck, it became
red and inflamed.

1210
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
And he therefore concluded
that that's where lust lived.

1211
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Erm.
 

1212
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
It turns out, though, that if
you read old phrenology texts,

1213
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:07,000
the original phrenology texts,
they read not unlike

1214
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
introductory psych texts, or
introductory brain science

1215
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
texts, with a few
unfortunate assumptions.

1216
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Like the notion that they skull
shape reflects underlying brain

1217
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
shape, which it does
not very well.

1218
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
There was -- yes, pink person.
 

1219
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:27,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

1220
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
PROFESSOR: OK well that's --
so, we'll put the, looking

1221
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
at the cells part in
under the anatomy.

1222
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
My wife would hate this.
 

1223
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,000
My wife is a neuroanatomist.
 

1224
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
That's what she
does for a living.

1225
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
She would want many
categories for that.

1226
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
All by itself.
 

1227
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,000
But, yeah, so you can go
look at, certainly as,

1228
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
well you can use this in
a number of contexts.

1229
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
If you're going to go
stimulate, these days, if

1230
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
you're going to go stimulate
brain cells, you might be

1231
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
doing it on a slice
of brain in a dish.

1232
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
To see how it's connected
to the next one.

1233
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
And you would be looking
at the individual cells

1234
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
under a microscope while
you were doing that.

1235
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Yes.
 

1236
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

1237
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah, that's
a, genetics is another

1238
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
candidate for 5.
 

1239
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:18,000
But I will, actually if you
take a look at, that allows

1240
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
me to make a somewhat
different point.

1241
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
On the handouts, the writing
assignments that you get in

1242
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:30,000
this course this year will
have as their starting point

1243
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
readings that live on the
stellar website for the course.

1244
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Or they particularly will if
I ever give Mara the disk

1245
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
to put them up there.
 

1246
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I'll have to remember that.
 

1247
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:45,000
The one that's on for this
lecture, if one wanted to write

1248
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:48,000
based starting from this
lecture, is actually

1249
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
a genetic study.
 

1250
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Turns out that there are two
flavors of vole out there.

1251
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
A little rodent-like animal.
 

1252
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Some voles are promiscuous.
 

1253
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Some voles are not promiscuous.
 

1254
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
They just hang out with one,
I guess lady voles, that's a

1255
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
basketball team, isn't it?
 

1256
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Anyway, the, I guess
they're [? valls, ?]

1257
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
not voles.
 

1258
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Anyway, the claim of a new
paper this year is that

1259
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:22,000
manipulation of a single gene
is able to turn promiscuous

1260
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
voles into faithful voles.
 

1261
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
So in that sense, yes,
absolutely genetics are a new

1262
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
tool for getting to this.
 

1263
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
It's not what I'm pushing for.
 

1264
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I'll take one more bit of
fishing expedition and then

1265
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I'll just -- all right,
that'll be, that's fine, too.

1266
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

1267
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
PROFESSOR: In vole land yes?
 

1268
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
It's, the male voles
who are promiscuous.

1269
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
 
 

1270
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
And they're manipulating
the sexual behavior

1271
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
of the male voles.
 

1272
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
The female voles don't have the
big asymmetry, the two species

1273
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
of voles don't have the big
asymmetry in their behavior

1274
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
to start with, apparently.
 

1275
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
So yeah, I think
it's a guy thing.

1276
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,000
More on that later in the term.
 

1277
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Yes.
 

1278
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:11,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

1279
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
PROFESSOR: Reading
brain signals.

1280
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
We'll call that recording.
 

1281
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
In some fashion or other.
 

1282
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
If you can stick an electrode
into the brain and stimulate,

1283
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,000
you can also stick an electrode
into the brain and record

1284
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
from brain tissue.
 

1285
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:32,000
And ask what a particular cell
or bunch of cells are doing.

1286
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,000
You can do this at a large
scale level in walking around

1287
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
human beings or animals, by
putting electrodes

1288
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:41,000
on the skull.
 

1289
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
You can read massed activities
of large numbers of neurons

1290
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
off the surface of the skull.
 

1291
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:54,000
And that's so-called electoral
encephalogram, EEG.

1292
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
But that's very useful, for
instance, in telling the

1293
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,000
difference between different
wake and sleep states.

1294
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
If you are deeply asleep,
the sort of sleep that when

1295
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
the alarm clock goes off
you're uh, where am I.

1296
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
If you look at the EEG,
you find big, slow waves.

1297
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
All the cells are active.
 

1298
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And then all the
cells are quiet.

1299
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
And they're all
firing together.

1300
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:25,000
When you're looking at an awake
individual, the waveform is

1301
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
much smaller amplitude
and higher frequency.

1302
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Because the calculus
piece of your brain

1303
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
is currently napping.
 

1304
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
And the psychology
piece is wide awake.

1305
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
And various bits are
doing things out of

1306
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
sync with each other.
 

1307
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
So you can see that from
massed recordings.

1308
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
But if you now go
stick an electrode.

1309
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Let's suppose we go and stick
an electrode into, well,

1310
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:54,000
let's take the same cell
that I stimulate here.

1311
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,000
And if the patient said, I feel
that in my toe, if instead of

1312
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:03,000
stimulating, you record, you
find out that that cell doesn't

1313
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
change its behavior at all over
a huge range of possible things

1314
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
that the organism
could be doing.

1315
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:15,000
But if you poke the toe, that
cell says, here I am, I'm

1316
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
interested in that
and exactly that.

1317
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
You go poke the armpit
or something, the

1318
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,000
cell doesn't care.
 

1319
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,000
You poke the other, the next to
over, the cell doesn't care.

1320
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
You poke one particular
toe, let us say,

1321
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
that cell will care.
 

1322
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Take a cell out here somewhere,
and that cell will care only if

1323
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
you put visual stimuli in a
particular little spot in the

1324
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:40,000
right side of the visual
space, in a very particular

1325
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
part of visual space.
 

1326
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Move over a little bit, and
it'll want stimulation in

1327
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
a different piece
of visual space.

1328
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Move elsewhere in the brain,
and now rather than liking,

1329
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
say, just something simple like
a line moving around, a cell

1330
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,000
down here, this is typically
done in things like monkeys and

1331
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,000
so, that cell might be very
interested if you show it

1332
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
the hand of a monkey.
 

1333
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
The cell's thrilled.
 

1334
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Show it a hunk of
chalk, I don't care.

1335
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
A nearby one might like
the face of a monkey.

1336
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
And so on.
 

1337
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
So you can find out what
individual cells are

1338
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,000
interested in, by
recording their activity.

1339
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,000
There are some significant
drawbacks to this.

1340
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
One of them is that you can
only sample from a tiny

1341
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:33,000
fraction of the cells, even
in an area that you

1342
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,000
are interested in.
 

1343
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
How many cells do you think
there are, how many neurons

1344
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
do you think there
are, in the brain?

1345
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
So, the answer's -- yes,
a lot is a good answer.

1346
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
But the answer's going to
be expressed in terms

1347
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
of 10 to the X.
 

1348
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
What's X, would you guess?
 

1349
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,000
 
 

1350
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
 

1351
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
PROFESSOR: The 24's are
a little high and the

1352
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
9's are a little low.
 

1353
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,000
When I asked this question when
I was in graduate school, I got

1354
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:07,000
the answer that there are
approximately, nobody knows

1355
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,000
the answer for sure, because
who's going to go and count.

1356
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
That there are 10 to the
12 neurons in the brain.

1357
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
And of these, I didn't even
tell you on this picture,

1358
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
but we can draw a
tail on this thing.

1359
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Hanging off the back of the
brain, sort of underneath the

1360
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,000
back, is the cerebellum.
 

1361
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
It means little brain.
 

1362
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
It's important in learning and
motor control sorts of things.

1363
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
We're not going to say much
about it here, sadly.

1364
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,000
But what my professor said
was, there are, 10 to the

1365
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
12 neurons in the brain.
 

1366
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Of these, 10 to the 13th
are in the cerebellum.

1367
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,000
 
 

1368
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,000
The quick on the uptake crowd
picked up that there's

1369
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,000
a problem here.
 

1370
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
What he was trying to
tell me was not that he

1371
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,000
didn't understand math.
 

1372
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
But that, look, we don't even
really know to an order of

1373
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,000
magnitude how many cells
there are in the brain.

1374
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:02,000
But, lots.
 

1375
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,000
On this order.
 

1376
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:09,000
How many cells can you record
from in a study of some

1377
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
function in the brain?
 

1378
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Heroic single-unit, single-cell
recording studies might have on

1379
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,000
the order of 10 to the 2nd,
100 cells recorded from.

1380
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
Moreover, if you're going to
stick an electrode in the

1381
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,000
brain, the cells that it
encounters are going to be

1382
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
biased by things like size.
 

1383
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
You're more likely to get big
cells than little cells.

1384
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
And big cells do things that
are different than little

1385
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
cells do in the brain.
 

1386
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
So, you can imagine that it
would be difficult to figure

1387
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:47,000
out what your laptop did
by recording from single

1388
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
components on the motherboard.
 

1389
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
That wouldn't be
particularly easy.

1390
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:56,000
It gets significantly worse
when you try to do that

1391
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
in the brain as a whole.
 

1392
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:03,000
 
 

1393
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:07,000
The things we know best about
in the brain are things where

1394
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:13,000
we can bring all of these
techniques to bear, and get

1395
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
what would be called converging
evidence, converging

1396
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
data, on it.
 

1397
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Evidence from multiple
different sources, and then

1398
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:25,000
corroborate that by looking
at behavioral measures.

1399
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Oh, let me say, all right.
 

1400
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
This is the moments in the
lecture where I really feel my

1401
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
wife looking over my shoulder.
 

1402
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:39,000
In two minutes I will polish
off the rest of the brain.

1403
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:43,000
So that's just the
surface of the brain.

1404
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,000
The brain is a 3-D structure.
 

1405
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,000
One way to very grossly think
about the overall structure of

1406
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:57,000
the brain is that if this
cortex, lying underneath cortex

1407
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
is what, are a bunch of
structures that often get

1408
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
called limbic structures.
 

1409
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
This is really an
outdated term.

1410
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
It comes from the word for
ring, and it was the notion

1411
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,000
that there was a circuit
of structures lying

1412
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
under the cortex.
 

1413
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
But there's a collection of
structures who will show up

1414
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:20,000
later in the term, with names
like the amygdala, from

1415
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
the Latin for almond.
 

1416
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
Hippocampus, Latin for almond
or Greek for almond, I'm

1417
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
not sure at the moment.
 

1418
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Hippocampus, from the
word for seahorse.

1419
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Not because you have almonds or
seahorses in your brain, but

1420
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
because the shapes of these
things are faintly reminiscent

1421
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
of such things out
in the real world.

1422
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:46,000
And other structures that turn
out to be vitally important in

1423
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
your emotional life
and in memory.

1424
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Hippocampus will show up
later as critical in memory.

1425
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Lying underneath there, and
heading on down into the spinal

1426
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,000
cord, oh I don't know, let's
call it the core today, or

1427
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:11,000
something, are a set of
structures that, well, we tend

1428
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,000
to spend a lot of time in
psychology talking about the

1429
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
cool stuff happening up in the
cortex and stuff like that.

1430
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:21,000
But the stuff you really don't
want to lose, the stuff we

1431
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
don't know about from lesion
studies, is down here.

1432
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:31,000
Because something in your brain
has to say to your heart, beat.

1433
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Beat.
 

1434
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Beat.
 

1435
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
That piece of brain goes,
you've got really big trouble.

1436
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
There's another piece
down there that says,

1437
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
time to breathe.
 

1438
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Time to breathe again.
 

1439
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I mean, it's not
glamorous work.

1440
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,000
But, yeah, somebody, so there's
a whole set of stuff here

1441
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
running vegetative processes.
 

1442
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:56,000
And also important, not just
for pacemaker kinds of things.

1443
01:18:56,000 --> 01:19:02,000
But also for general issues
of arousal, and sleep and

1444
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
wakefulness, those
sort of things.

1445
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
So that is an embarrassingly
brief tour of, you can spend

1446
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
your life on neuroanatomy.
 

1447
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Trust me, my wife does.
 

1448
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:16,000
We'll come back and talk about
single cells on Tuesday.

1449
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:16,000
