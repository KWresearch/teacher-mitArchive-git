00:00:13 --> 00:00:18
PROFESSOR: What I'm going to do
for the next three lectures

7
00:00:18 --> 00:00:23
is to talk about how we see.
 

8
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
What I'm going to do today
is talk about how we

9
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
take information in.
 

10
00:00:29 --> 00:00:33
Next Tuesday, I'll talk about
the fact that we take in too

11
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
much information -- more
information than we can

12
00:00:35 --> 00:00:40
use and we have to select
amongst that information.

13
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
 
 

14
00:00:43 --> 00:00:48
On Thursday of next week, what
I'll talk about is the fact

15
00:00:48 --> 00:00:55
that perception is never just a
direct, somehow registration

16
00:00:55 --> 00:00:56
of the outside world.
 

17
00:00:56 --> 00:00:59
It's always an active
interpretation of the world,

18
00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
and I'll talk about how we go
about interpreting the

19
00:01:02 --> 00:01:06
information that we've
gotten from the outside.

20
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
I will be barely
able to scratch the

21
00:01:09 --> 00:01:11
surface of the topic.
 

22
00:01:11 --> 00:01:14
I will abandon all discussion
of the other senses,

23
00:01:14 --> 00:01:16
for instance, which
is a great pity.

24
00:01:16 --> 00:01:19
Now, it's true that I can
barely scratch the surface of

25
00:01:19 --> 00:01:23
almost any topic in this
course, but here the danger is

26
00:01:23 --> 00:01:25
greater because this
is actually what I

27
00:01:25 --> 00:01:27
do for a living.
 

28
00:01:27 --> 00:01:35
So, on any little bit of
this, I can talk forever.

29
00:01:35 --> 00:01:39
So, exactly how much of the
surface I scratch will

30
00:01:39 --> 00:01:43
be determined by how far
afield I end up going.

31
00:01:43 --> 00:01:49
This slide is up there
to illustrate, in some

32
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
sense, those three bits.
 

33
00:01:51 --> 00:01:56
Let's see, if I take the stage,
chalkboard light off -- there

34
00:01:56 --> 00:01:59
we go, you want to go off?
 

35
00:01:59 --> 00:02:00
Then you can see a
little bit better.

36
00:02:00 --> 00:02:04
 
 

37
00:02:04 --> 00:02:05
You can sort of see stuff.
 

38
00:02:05 --> 00:02:09
 
 

39
00:02:09 --> 00:02:16
That's this Bruegel's painting
of the battle between the good

40
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
angels and the bad angels.
 

41
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
For me, the purpose is to say
look, it's clear that you see

42
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
something, it's clear that
what you are seeing is an

43
00:02:26 --> 00:02:28
active interpretation.
 

44
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
In fact, you may not have
particularly known that it was

45
00:02:30 --> 00:02:34
a battle between good angels
and bad angels before

46
00:02:34 --> 00:02:35
you look at it.
 

47
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
It's also clear that even
though you, in some sense, see

48
00:02:39 --> 00:02:42
the whole thing, you're not
processing it fully, at

49
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
least not all at once.
 

50
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
So, for instance, you may not
have particularly noticed -- I

51
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
don't know what he is, he's a
really cool beast -- I'm not

52
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
sure if that's a bad angel
falling or something.

53
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
But you probably hadn't
particularly noticed

54
00:02:55 --> 00:02:56
this fish guy.
 

55
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
Actually, in this picture
you're probably still not

56
00:02:59 --> 00:03:02
noticing the fish guy -- he
just looks like a blob.

57
00:03:02 --> 00:03:06
It's a great picture,
look at it sometime.

58
00:03:06 --> 00:03:10
And this guy's got very
bad stomach problems,

59
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
whatever he's doing.
 

60
00:03:12 --> 00:03:14
OK.
 

61
00:03:14 --> 00:03:18
Rather than continuing to try
to look at a murky picture,

62
00:03:18 --> 00:03:22
let's go to a less murky
picture and let's start by

63
00:03:22 --> 00:03:27
talking about how you actually
get information in from the

64
00:03:27 --> 00:03:36
visual system, which obviously
involves going through the eye.

65
00:03:36 --> 00:03:39
On the handout, which
-- do I have a copy

66
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
of it here, yes, OK.
 

67
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
A lot of terminology.
 

68
00:03:44 --> 00:03:46
Are you responsible for it?
 

69
00:03:46 --> 00:03:47
Yes, of course.
 

70
00:03:47 --> 00:03:51
If you miss some little bit of
terminology, that's not going

71
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
to sink you in the course,
either on this topic or

72
00:03:54 --> 00:03:56
on any other topic.
 

73
00:03:56 --> 00:04:01
You want to put your effort
into thinking about the broader

74
00:04:01 --> 00:04:05
topic, but it's useful in being
able to talk intelligently

75
00:04:05 --> 00:04:09
about it to get a grip on some
of this terminology, and hence,

76
00:04:09 --> 00:04:13
the tour of the visual system
that I will now embark on.

77
00:04:13 --> 00:04:19
From the outside-in, the
purpose of the eye, or at least

78
00:04:19 --> 00:04:23
the front half of the eye is
to form an image on the

79
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
back half of the eye.
 

80
00:04:25 --> 00:04:29
So all of this, sometimes
called the anterior segment of

81
00:04:29 --> 00:04:33
the eye, is there to form an
image, like a camera would, on

82
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
the back surface of the eye.
 

83
00:04:36 --> 00:04:40
Most of the optical power
of the eye is at the very

84
00:04:40 --> 00:04:41
front surface of it.
 

85
00:04:41 --> 00:04:45
That front surface is
called the cornea.

86
00:04:45 --> 00:04:51
It has, apart from its virtues
as a lens focusing light, it

87
00:04:51 --> 00:04:55
is also one of the two
surfaces in the body

88
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
most sensitive to pain.
 

89
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
You may try this out
if you want at home.

90
00:05:02 --> 00:05:06
I don't recommend it, but
if you scratch your cornea

91
00:05:06 --> 00:05:09
you will know it and
you will be happy.

92
00:05:09 --> 00:05:11
What's the other one?
 

93
00:05:11 --> 00:05:15
What's the other
surface, do you think?

94
00:05:15 --> 00:05:19
Anybody care to
venture a guess?

95
00:05:19 --> 00:05:19
Thumbs?
 

96
00:05:19 --> 00:05:23
 
 

97
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
No, that's a novel thought.
 

98
00:05:26 --> 00:05:30
No, look -- he's thinking like
the cartoons, right, you hit

99
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
the thumb with the hammer
and ow, it hurts.

100
00:05:32 --> 00:05:34
Let me tell you, if you hit
your cornea with the hammer

101
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
it hurts a lot more.
 

102
00:05:36 --> 00:05:37
Yes?
 

103
00:05:37 --> 00:05:38
AUDIENCE: Some place
inside the mouth?

104
00:05:38 --> 00:05:40
PROFESSOR: Some place
inside the mouth.

105
00:05:40 --> 00:05:40
No.
 

106
00:05:40 --> 00:05:44
Again, you think about that
inside the mouth is a place

107
00:05:44 --> 00:05:48
where pain happens, but that's
because you do stupid things

108
00:05:48 --> 00:05:52
with your mouth, like hey,
that pizza looks good.

109
00:05:52 --> 00:05:52
Ow.
 

110
00:05:52 --> 00:05:56
You would never stick the
pizza on your eyeball.

111
00:05:56 --> 00:05:59
 
 

112
00:05:59 --> 00:06:05
So, again, nicely innervated
for pain but not particularly.

113
00:06:05 --> 00:06:07
Not the other great location.
 

114
00:06:07 --> 00:06:08
I'll take one more here.
 

115
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
 

116
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
at the bottom of your foot?
 

117
00:06:12 --> 00:06:14
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah, same
sort of thing, right.

118
00:06:14 --> 00:06:16
You step on nails or something.
 

119
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
The bottom of your
foot's a good place.

120
00:06:18 --> 00:06:21
 
 

121
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
There's two people here, I've
just gotta take their answers

122
00:06:23 --> 00:06:24
because they're so eager.
 

123
00:06:24 --> 00:06:26
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's
what I was going to say,

124
00:06:26 --> 00:06:27
somewhere inside your ear.
 

125
00:06:27 --> 00:06:31
PROFESSOR: Somewhere inside
your ear is the point, not the

126
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
chunk that so many people
are thrilled with.

127
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
Oh, let's put a hole in
this -- oh, that was

128
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
fun, let's do it again.
 

129
00:06:37 --> 00:06:40
That obviously hurts, I guess.
 

130
00:06:40 --> 00:06:41
I've never gone in
for this myself.

131
00:06:41 --> 00:06:45
 
 

132
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
One of the reasons your mother
said don't put anything inside

133
00:06:48 --> 00:06:52
your ear that's bigger than
your elbow is because if you

134
00:06:52 --> 00:06:55
put something small and pointy
in there, it eventually reaches

135
00:06:55 --> 00:06:58
your eardrum and that's
the other surface.

136
00:06:58 --> 00:07:05
When you had an ear infection
as a kid and the pressure from

137
00:07:05 --> 00:07:09
your middle ear, the fluid in
your ear, stretched that, it

138
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
hurt, and that hurts a lot.
 

139
00:07:11 --> 00:07:16
So, don't put the hot
pizza in your ear either.

140
00:07:16 --> 00:07:16
OK.
 

141
00:07:16 --> 00:07:20
The cornea is just a
relatively thin layer.

142
00:07:20 --> 00:07:25
It's held in shape by fluid, a
watery-like fluid, which is

143
00:07:25 --> 00:07:28
known technically as the
aqueous humor -- humor in

144
00:07:28 --> 00:07:30
this case has nothing
to do with being funny.

145
00:07:30 --> 00:07:38
It's an old word for a fluid,
It forms a space that separates

146
00:07:38 --> 00:07:41
the cornea from the iris.
 

147
00:07:41 --> 00:07:46
The iris is the bit that gives
your eye its color, but it's

148
00:07:46 --> 00:07:50
basically a sphincter of muscle
with a hole in it, and that

149
00:07:50 --> 00:07:55
hold is the pupil of the eye,
which is the aperture

150
00:07:55 --> 00:07:56
of the camera.
 

151
00:07:56 --> 00:08:03
That's where light's getting
in from the outside into the

152
00:08:03 --> 00:08:06
inner portions of the eye.
 

153
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
OK.
 

154
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
The pupil changes size, because
you've got this sphincter

155
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14
of muscle that either
relaxes or contracts.

156
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
What makes it change size?
 

157
00:08:16 --> 00:08:17
AUDIENCE: Light.
 

158
00:08:17 --> 00:08:18
PROFESSOR: Light.
 

159
00:08:18 --> 00:08:18
We know that.
 

160
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
More light makes it do what?
 

161
00:08:20 --> 00:08:21
AUDIENCE: Get smaller.
 

162
00:08:21 --> 00:08:22
PROFESSOR: Get smaller.
 

163
00:08:22 --> 00:08:23
Why?
 

164
00:08:23 --> 00:08:25
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
 

165
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
there's less light.

166
00:08:27 --> 00:08:29
Sure, it's going to be
less light, but why

167
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
do you have this?
 

168
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
What did they teach
you in 3rd grade?

169
00:08:33 --> 00:08:34
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
 

170
00:08:34 --> 00:08:36
PROFESSOR: Never stick
your elbow in your eye.

171
00:08:36 --> 00:08:38
Yes, I know that.
 

172
00:08:38 --> 00:08:39
No, I need a hand here.
 

173
00:08:39 --> 00:08:41
There's too many mutterings.
 

174
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
There's a hand.
 

175
00:08:44 --> 00:08:44
AUDIENCE: Because you
don't want to go blind.

176
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
PROFESSOR: Because you
don't want to go blind.

177
00:08:46 --> 00:08:47
Why would you go blind?
 

178
00:08:47 --> 00:08:48
AUDIENCE: There's
too much light.

179
00:08:48 --> 00:08:49
PROFESSOR: There's
too much light.

180
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
See, that's what they
teach you in 3rd grade.

181
00:08:51 --> 00:08:53
It's bogus.
 

182
00:08:53 --> 00:09:01
It sounds good and it seems to
make sense, but ask yourself

183
00:09:01 --> 00:09:06
what level of protection
that pupil can give you.

184
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
Right, so how much light
is it going to cut out?

185
00:09:09 --> 00:09:14
The answer is it cuts out a
bit more than a factor of 10.

186
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
From the largest it can be to
the smallest it'll be if you

187
00:09:17 --> 00:09:20
stare at -- you know, if you're
out in really bright light.

188
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
So it can take it can change
light levels by about

189
00:09:23 --> 00:09:24
a factor of 10.
 

190
00:09:24 --> 00:09:27
If you go from in here right
now -- actually, it's fairly

191
00:09:27 --> 00:09:32
dim in here -- but if you go
from here to just go outside

192
00:09:32 --> 00:09:37
into the courtyard, the change
in light level is going to be

193
00:09:37 --> 00:09:40
on the order of a factor
of 1,000 right there.

194
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
The change in light level that
your visual system can deal

195
00:09:43 --> 00:09:49
with from, say, a moonlit night
to bright sun on a snow field

196
00:09:49 --> 00:09:52
is on the order of 10 to the
twelfth or 10 to

197
00:09:52 --> 00:09:53
the thirteenth.
 

198
00:09:53 --> 00:09:59
So there's no way that the need
to protect yourself is going

199
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02
to be taken care of by
the pupil of the eye.

200
00:10:02 --> 00:10:05
There's just not
enough range there.

201
00:10:05 --> 00:10:09
The pupillary constriction,
what it's probably doing for

202
00:10:09 --> 00:10:13
you, those of you who are
photographers, is it's

203
00:10:13 --> 00:10:15
increasing the depth of
field on your camera.

204
00:10:15 --> 00:10:19
A pinhole camera will
focus many different

205
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
distances at once.
 

206
00:10:21 --> 00:10:26
A larger aperature will only
focus one plane at one time.

207
00:10:26 --> 00:10:30
And so if you've got lots of
light, you crank down the pupil

208
00:10:30 --> 00:10:33
in order to be able to focus --
in order to get better

209
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
focus, basically.
 

210
00:10:35 --> 00:10:39
But the protection thing just
doesn't -- it's not a stupid

211
00:10:39 --> 00:10:43
answer because it's what
everybody believes, but

212
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
it doesn't turn out to
be a correct answer.

213
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
Oh, now there's several other
things that will change the

214
00:10:49 --> 00:10:52
size of your pupil, but one
other of interest, what else

215
00:10:52 --> 00:10:53
changes the size of your pupil?
 

216
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
Anybody know anything else that
they can change the size--?

217
00:10:56 --> 00:10:56
Yup?
 

218
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
AUDIENCE: Looking all the
way down there at you.

219
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
PROFESSOR: Looking all the
way down there at me.

220
00:11:01 --> 00:11:07
Well, yes, but for
reasons that are--.

221
00:11:07 --> 00:11:07
Why?
 

222
00:11:07 --> 00:11:12
 
 

223
00:11:12 --> 00:11:15
Well, no, well you're changing
-- sorry, that's the

224
00:11:15 --> 00:11:16
next bullet here.
 

225
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
What you're changing when you
change focus of the eye is

226
00:11:19 --> 00:11:22
you're changing the shape of
the lens -- at least you are.

227
00:11:22 --> 00:11:28
I'm not because at my age the
lens has basically become a

228
00:11:28 --> 00:11:34
rigid lump, and so when I want
to look from there to here,

229
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36
I use an external lens.
 

230
00:11:36 --> 00:11:37
Yes, back to the pupil.
 

231
00:11:37 --> 00:11:38
AUDIENCE: When you lie.
 

232
00:11:38 --> 00:11:39
PROFESSOR: When you lie.
 

233
00:11:39 --> 00:11:44
Yes, that will work a little
bit maybe, not reliably enough

234
00:11:44 --> 00:11:47
to -- you know, the CIA or
something every now and then

235
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
gets the idea that
that really works.

236
00:11:50 --> 00:11:52
It's on the right
general track.

237
00:11:52 --> 00:11:52
Yeah?
 

238
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
AUDIENCE: Some drugs do that?
 

239
00:11:55 --> 00:11:55
PROFESSOR: Yup.
 

240
00:11:55 --> 00:12:02
Some drugs will
certainly modulate it.

241
00:12:02 --> 00:12:03
All right, [UNINTELLIGIBLE].
 

242
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
AUDIENCE: When you look at the
object of your affection.

243
00:12:05 --> 00:12:06
PROFESSOR: There you go.
 

244
00:12:06 --> 00:12:11
That's particularly the
one I was fishing for.

245
00:12:11 --> 00:12:16
Your level of arousal will
change the size of your pupil.

246
00:12:16 --> 00:12:20
Notably, if you look at
something that you like or

247
00:12:20 --> 00:12:25
someone that you like,
your pupils get bigger.

248
00:12:25 --> 00:12:28
Obviously, not everybody here
knew that explicitly, but you

249
00:12:28 --> 00:12:32
sort of knew that implicitly,
because the result of that is

250
00:12:32 --> 00:12:36
that you think that things with
big pupils are cuter than

251
00:12:36 --> 00:12:39
things a little pinhole
pupils, right.

252
00:12:39 --> 00:12:44
That's why sappy cartoons
or cards have big pupils.

253
00:12:44 --> 00:12:50
It is also why in years gone
by, women would put a drug

254
00:12:50 --> 00:12:54
known as atropine or known as
a cosmetic as belladonna for

255
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
pretty woman, pretty girl.
 

256
00:12:57 --> 00:13:01
In their eyes what it did was
it paralyzed and relaxed the

257
00:13:01 --> 00:13:04
muscles of the irish and
made a great big pupil.

258
00:13:04 --> 00:13:06
It didn't do anything good
for their vision because it

259
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
made things kind of blurry.
 

260
00:13:08 --> 00:13:10
It also paralyzing the lens.
 

261
00:13:10 --> 00:13:14
But it gave them great big
pupils, and so they're looking

262
00:13:14 --> 00:13:18
at the guy who may or may not
be the object of their desire

263
00:13:18 --> 00:13:23
-- they're looking at some guy,
they can't see him so well,

264
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
which who knows, that
may have helped.

265
00:13:25 --> 00:13:29
But he's looking at her
thinking implicitly her

266
00:13:29 --> 00:13:33
pupils are really big,
I know what that means.

267
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
Well, it turns out, following
up on whoever it was

268
00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
over there, it actually
means she's on drugs.

269
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
 
 

270
00:13:40 --> 00:13:47
In any case, pupil size is
modulated by emotional state

271
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
and it's one of these things
that we sort of knew

272
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
implicitly, people know
implicitly, and think big

273
00:13:53 --> 00:13:57
pupils are attractive
for that reason.

274
00:13:57 --> 00:13:58
It's only when you show up
here you find out these

275
00:13:58 --> 00:14:00
things explicitly.
 

276
00:14:00 --> 00:14:03
All right, I've already said
something about the lens.

277
00:14:03 --> 00:14:06
The most notable thing about
the lens is it gets harder

278
00:14:06 --> 00:14:09
with age and -- you
could try this out.

279
00:14:09 --> 00:14:15
In fact, it's a good time
in your life to start

280
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
this experiment.
 

281
00:14:17 --> 00:14:21
Take something like the handout
and ask yourself how close you

282
00:14:21 --> 00:14:26
can get and have the letters
still be in sharp focus.

283
00:14:26 --> 00:14:29
This is so sad it
like makes me weep.

284
00:14:29 --> 00:14:32
But I know you're
getting there, too.

285
00:14:32 --> 00:14:35
Now what you can do -- you
could actually, if you're

286
00:14:35 --> 00:14:38
compulsive about these sort of
things, write it down somewhere

287
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
and just check every year.
 

288
00:14:40 --> 00:14:43
This is one of those things
where the signs of aging

289
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46
start showing up now.
 

290
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
You will be able to see, even
during the course of your

291
00:14:49 --> 00:14:52
twenties that that so-called
near point is moving

292
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
further out.
 

293
00:14:54 --> 00:14:59
For me without my glasses
we're out here somewhere.

294
00:14:59 --> 00:15:03
And eventually you're locked
at one plane of focus, and

295
00:15:03 --> 00:15:06
depending on where that is,
determines which particular

296
00:15:06 --> 00:15:07
set of glasses you need --
 

297
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
do you need glasses to read, do
you need bifocals, whatever.

298
00:15:10 --> 00:15:12
It's because you've
lost the ability to

299
00:15:12 --> 00:15:15
fine-tune that focus.
 

300
00:15:15 --> 00:15:20
Now, you need something to hold
the rest of the eye in shape.

301
00:15:20 --> 00:15:26
What you've got in there is
it's really a jelly called

302
00:15:26 --> 00:15:31
the vitreous humor for
the glass-like substance.

303
00:15:31 --> 00:15:34
For our purposes it's not
desperately interesting, it's

304
00:15:34 --> 00:15:38
there to hold your eye out so
that the front end of the eye

305
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
can make an image on
this back surface.

306
00:15:40 --> 00:15:49
The back surface of the eye
where the transduction from

307
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
photons, the light energy, into
signals in the nervous system

308
00:15:52 --> 00:15:55
where that takes place, that
tissue is known as the retina

309
00:15:55 --> 00:15:58
-- the word comes from
the word for a net.

310
00:15:58 --> 00:16:04
 
 

311
00:16:04 --> 00:16:10
The fovea is the point -- fovea
comes the word for pit -- it's

312
00:16:10 --> 00:16:16
the point on the retina where
you have the highest visual

313
00:16:16 --> 00:16:22
aquity, the greatest ability
to resolve small details.

314
00:16:22 --> 00:16:28
You don't particularly realize
in the course of your normal

315
00:16:28 --> 00:16:32
day-to-day existence just how
bad vision gets away

316
00:16:32 --> 00:16:36
from the fovea.
 

317
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
You have this notion of a
highly detailed world that's

318
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
in focus all over the place.
 

319
00:16:42 --> 00:16:44
But that, to jump ahead to
the third lecture in this

320
00:16:44 --> 00:16:46
series, is a construction.
 

321
00:16:46 --> 00:16:47
It's not reality.
 

322
00:16:47 --> 00:16:49
And that you can
prove to yourself.

323
00:16:49 --> 00:16:53
Take the handout again, hold it
at some comfortable reading

324
00:16:53 --> 00:16:58
distance, fixate on the l
on that second line there

325
00:16:58 --> 00:17:01
where it says Lecture 4.
 

326
00:17:01 --> 00:17:05
If you're fixating on the
l, the l is forming an

327
00:17:05 --> 00:17:06
image on your fovea.
 

328
00:17:06 --> 00:17:10
Ask yourself while you're
fixated on the l, how many

329
00:17:10 --> 00:17:13
letters off to the right
you can actually read.

330
00:17:13 --> 00:17:18
And the answer is
going to be not many.

331
00:17:18 --> 00:17:20
If you think you can read to
the end of line it's because

332
00:17:20 --> 00:17:24
you're not fixating -- you're
moving your eyes around.

333
00:17:24 --> 00:17:26
Again, like the pupil
thing, this is something

334
00:17:26 --> 00:17:27
you knew implicitly.
 

335
00:17:27 --> 00:17:33
Nobody sits there and says I'm
going to read this handout.

336
00:17:33 --> 00:17:38
I can see it, it's there, but I
can't read it because the

337
00:17:38 --> 00:17:43
outside of the fovea, I simply
don't have the resolving

338
00:17:43 --> 00:17:47
ability to do it.
 

339
00:17:47 --> 00:17:48
Why not?
 

340
00:17:48 --> 00:17:50
Well, I can give you
at least one reason.

341
00:17:50 --> 00:17:53
You have about a hundred
million photoreceptors

342
00:17:53 --> 00:17:55
in your retina.
 

343
00:17:55 --> 00:18:00
Photoreceptors are the cells
that convert light energy

344
00:18:00 --> 00:18:01
into a signal in the
nervous system, they're the

345
00:18:01 --> 00:18:04
transduction elements.
 

346
00:18:04 --> 00:18:10
You have only about a quarter
of a million to a million

347
00:18:10 --> 00:18:16
axons, nerve fibers running
from the eye to the brain.

348
00:18:16 --> 00:18:21
So that hundred million has got
to get boiled down to the much

349
00:18:21 --> 00:18:25
smaller number that you've
got available to you.

350
00:18:25 --> 00:18:46
So that means you can't treat
each photoreceptor as a pixel

351
00:18:46 --> 00:18:49
with a private line
to the brain.

352
00:18:49 --> 00:18:52
You do have something
approximating this in the

353
00:18:52 --> 00:18:56
fovea where you have fine
detailed resolution.

354
00:18:56 --> 00:19:01
But in the periphery, away from
the fovea, what you have is

355
00:19:01 --> 00:19:06
many, many, many, many
photoreceptors that are all

356
00:19:06 --> 00:19:10
ganged together to send
their signal off to the

357
00:19:10 --> 00:19:11
central nervous system.
 

358
00:19:11 --> 00:19:20
So you lose resolution out
there in the periphery.

359
00:19:20 --> 00:19:22
Let's say a little more about
the details of that retina.

360
00:19:22 --> 00:19:27
Oh, the optic nerve is the
bundle of fibers going off

361
00:19:27 --> 00:19:31
from the eye to the brain.
 

362
00:19:31 --> 00:19:34
I'll say a bit more about
that in a minute or so.

363
00:19:34 --> 00:19:39
A quick tour of the
retina itself.

364
00:19:39 --> 00:19:43
Up at the top there you've got
the photoreceptors, these

365
00:19:43 --> 00:19:45
transduction elements.
 

366
00:19:45 --> 00:19:49
There are two flavors of them
called rods and cones -- named

367
00:19:49 --> 00:19:52
rods and cones because under
the microscope rods are

368
00:19:52 --> 00:19:53
rod-shaped and cones
are cone-shaped.

369
00:19:53 --> 00:19:56
 
 

370
00:19:56 --> 00:20:01
They are different in their
functions and capabilities.

371
00:20:01 --> 00:20:06
Cones operate in bright
light at daylight levels.

372
00:20:06 --> 00:20:11
They do mediate color vision
and they are concentrated

373
00:20:11 --> 00:20:13
at the fovea.
 

374
00:20:13 --> 00:20:18
They are most densely
represented at the fovea.

375
00:20:18 --> 00:20:22
Rods work in dim light levels.
 

376
00:20:22 --> 00:20:29
They are not able to mediate
color vision, which is why on a

377
00:20:29 --> 00:20:31
moonlit night you don't see
colors -- it's not because

378
00:20:31 --> 00:20:33
color's somehow drained
out of the world.

379
00:20:33 --> 00:20:36
It's because the visual system
that's looking at that world

380
00:20:36 --> 00:20:42
can no longer analyze the input
for color information, but only

381
00:20:42 --> 00:20:46
for grey scaled information.
 

382
00:20:46 --> 00:20:49
Rod photoreceptors are
concentrated away from

383
00:20:49 --> 00:20:53
the retina -- I'm sorry,
away from the fovea.

384
00:20:53 --> 00:20:57
They are, in fact, absent
from the central fovea.

385
00:20:57 --> 00:21:00
 
 

386
00:21:00 --> 00:21:04
The best place to see this
actually is if your room gets

387
00:21:04 --> 00:21:11
dim enough at night that you
can't see color, you're working

388
00:21:11 --> 00:21:15
in the rod realm, and then you
will discover that if you

389
00:21:15 --> 00:21:18
fixate on a dim spot of
light you can't see it.

390
00:21:18 --> 00:21:20
That there might be something
out here -- you notice it and

391
00:21:20 --> 00:21:23
then you move your eye to look
at it and it'll disappear,

392
00:21:23 --> 00:21:26
because the image, if it's
small enough, will now fall

393
00:21:26 --> 00:21:33
into the fovea and there are no
rods there, you can't see it.

394
00:21:33 --> 00:21:36
This is why if you're a star
gazer and you're looking at a

395
00:21:36 --> 00:21:40
dim star, you want to look at
that star out of the so-called

396
00:21:40 --> 00:21:41
corner of your eye.
 

397
00:21:41 --> 00:21:45
The corner of your eye is about
20 degrees away from straight

398
00:21:45 --> 00:21:48
ahead because that's where the
density of rod photoreceptors

399
00:21:48 --> 00:21:50
turns out to be greatest.
 

400
00:21:50 --> 00:21:54
 
 

401
00:21:54 --> 00:21:57
I was going to say something
else about rod photoreceptors,

402
00:21:57 --> 00:21:59
but that has disappeared
from my mind.

403
00:21:59 --> 00:22:06
So I will say that the rest
of this is a collection of

404
00:22:06 --> 00:22:08
nerve cells, of neurons.
 

405
00:22:08 --> 00:22:10
It's really a little
chunk of brain.

406
00:22:10 --> 00:22:13
Developmentally the retina is a
chunk of brain that's pushed

407
00:22:13 --> 00:22:18
out into the eye, and this is
the start of the visual

408
00:22:18 --> 00:22:20
nervous system.
 

409
00:22:20 --> 00:22:25
For present purposes it's worth
thinking about two aspects

410
00:22:25 --> 00:22:28
of this organization.
 

411
00:22:28 --> 00:22:38
One is a through path that runs
from the photoreceptors through

412
00:22:38 --> 00:22:42
so-called bipolar cells
to ganglion cells.

413
00:22:42 --> 00:22:46
There's sort of a vertical path
in this picture heading from

414
00:22:46 --> 00:22:49
the photoreceptors
out to the brain.

415
00:22:49 --> 00:22:55
Then there are cells whose
processes are sitting here and

416
00:22:55 --> 00:22:59
here making horizontal
connections so that

417
00:22:59 --> 00:23:03
photoreceptors don't behave
like isolated pixels so that

418
00:23:03 --> 00:23:06
they can talk to each other,
and so you can start doing some

419
00:23:06 --> 00:23:09
sort calculations, if you like.
 

420
00:23:09 --> 00:23:12
Those are cells like horizontal
cells that have their processes

421
00:23:12 --> 00:23:15
up here, and amacrine
cells that have their

422
00:23:15 --> 00:23:16
processes down here.
 

423
00:23:16 --> 00:23:19
So those are things making
horizontal connections

424
00:23:19 --> 00:23:20
across the retina.
 

425
00:23:20 --> 00:23:24
Photoreceptors, bipolar cells,
ganglion cells are forming this

426
00:23:24 --> 00:23:29
through pathway going
from eye to brain.

427
00:23:29 --> 00:23:35
Now, if you were to look at
this and I was to say where is

428
00:23:35 --> 00:23:39
light coming from in this
picture, the reasonable

429
00:23:39 --> 00:23:41
answer would be?
 

430
00:23:41 --> 00:23:42
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
 

431
00:23:42 --> 00:23:49
 
 

432
00:23:49 --> 00:23:51
PROFESSOR: It would seem like a
reasonable answer would be like

433
00:23:51 --> 00:23:53
it's coming from the top hit in
the photoreceptors and heading

434
00:23:53 --> 00:23:54
off to the brain and
out the bottom.

435
00:23:54 --> 00:23:57
But in fact, light's
coming from there.

436
00:23:57 --> 00:24:00
The retina is put on backwards
in an interesting kind of a

437
00:24:00 --> 00:24:05
way, or intuitively backwards
at least, so that light shines

438
00:24:05 --> 00:24:11
through all of this stuff
before actually getting

439
00:24:11 --> 00:24:13
to the photoreceptors.
 

440
00:24:13 --> 00:24:15
Why is that?
 

441
00:24:15 --> 00:24:17
Well, there are a variety
of possible answers.

442
00:24:17 --> 00:24:22
One of the answers is -- let's
see, the remaining term on the

443
00:24:22 --> 00:24:28
list that I haven't mentioned
in that retina list, which is

444
00:24:28 --> 00:24:30
actually at the top
ofo the list, it says

445
00:24:30 --> 00:24:30
pigment epithelium.
 

446
00:24:30 --> 00:24:36
 
 

447
00:24:36 --> 00:24:42
Up here there would be a layer
of what boils down to black

448
00:24:42 --> 00:24:46
gunk coating the back surface
of the eye, and the

449
00:24:46 --> 00:24:49
photoreceptors are
stuck into that.

450
00:24:49 --> 00:24:51
That's the pigment epithelium.
 

451
00:24:51 --> 00:24:57
What it's there for is -- well,
let's suppose that all of you

452
00:24:57 --> 00:25:05
guys are photoreceptors and
here I am, I'm a photon and I'm

453
00:25:05 --> 00:25:08
part of this image of the world
on the outside and I'm coming

454
00:25:08 --> 00:25:12
flying in, and with luck I'll
be absorbed by Mr.

455
00:25:12 --> 00:25:15
Photoreceptor here.
 

456
00:25:15 --> 00:25:16
But suppose I don't?
 

457
00:25:16 --> 00:25:18
Suppose I hit over here.
 

458
00:25:18 --> 00:25:24
Well, photons don't have
much conscious life

459
00:25:24 --> 00:25:25
as far as we know.
 

460
00:25:25 --> 00:25:28
You, the owner of this visual
system, don't want that photon

461
00:25:28 --> 00:25:30
bouncing around anywhere else.
 

462
00:25:30 --> 00:25:33
You want it either to be
absorbed by a photographers

463
00:25:33 --> 00:25:34
or to be gone.
 

464
00:25:34 --> 00:25:37
Because if it bounces and hits
up there somewhere it's going

465
00:25:37 --> 00:25:38
to degrade the image, right.
 

466
00:25:38 --> 00:25:41
It's going to be like haze
across the image if it's not

467
00:25:41 --> 00:25:47
landing where it should to
make a nice starp image.

468
00:25:47 --> 00:25:55
So this black gunk is there to
soak up extra photoreceptors.

469
00:25:55 --> 00:26:00
A very good idea if you are a
diurnal animal, an animal who

470
00:26:00 --> 00:26:02
works out in bright light.
 

471
00:26:02 --> 00:26:07
Not such a good idea if you're
an animal who is nocturnal or

472
00:26:07 --> 00:26:09
running around in dim light.
 

473
00:26:09 --> 00:26:12
There what you want to do
is catch every photon that

474
00:26:12 --> 00:26:14
you can possibly catch.
 

475
00:26:14 --> 00:26:17
So if you're a cat,
for example, you do

476
00:26:17 --> 00:26:18
this differently.
 

477
00:26:18 --> 00:26:21
Instead of a pigment epithelium
at the back of your eye, you

478
00:26:21 --> 00:26:29
have a structure known as the
tapetum -- it's actually very

479
00:26:29 --> 00:26:31
beautiful, it looks like Mother
of Pearl, but you only get to

480
00:26:31 --> 00:26:36
see that if you take it out of
the cat, which makes the

481
00:26:36 --> 00:26:39
cat less beautiful.
 

482
00:26:39 --> 00:26:41
But it's a reflective surface.
 

483
00:26:41 --> 00:26:48
This is why if you get a cat in
your flashlight beam, its eyes

484
00:26:48 --> 00:26:53
seem to glow at you, because
the light comes in -- if it

485
00:26:53 --> 00:26:56
doesn't get absorbed by, say,
the photoreceptors, it can

486
00:26:56 --> 00:26:59
bounce and an amount of
it will bounce back out.

487
00:26:59 --> 00:27:02
Some amount of light will
bounce back out of your eyes.

488
00:27:02 --> 00:27:07
That's what you see as
red eye in an unlucky

489
00:27:07 --> 00:27:09
photograph, for example.
 

490
00:27:09 --> 00:27:10
Is that a hand?
 

491
00:27:10 --> 00:27:15
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't that
distort the image?

492
00:27:15 --> 00:27:17
PROFESSOR: To the cat.
 

493
00:27:17 --> 00:27:17
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
 

494
00:27:17 --> 00:27:18
PROFESSOR: Yeah, absolutely.
 

495
00:27:18 --> 00:27:21
That's why you almost
never see cats reading

496
00:27:21 --> 00:27:23
The New York Times.
 

497
00:27:23 --> 00:27:27
No, cat visual aquity
is pretty lousy.

498
00:27:27 --> 00:27:33
A cat has different visual
desires than you and I do.

499
00:27:33 --> 00:27:38
The cat's not big on sweating
the visual aquity thing.

500
00:27:38 --> 00:27:40
The cat wants to
know, did it move?

501
00:27:40 --> 00:27:41
Can I jump on it?
 

502
00:27:41 --> 00:27:43
Can I bite it?
 

503
00:27:43 --> 00:27:44
Is it another cat?
 

504
00:27:44 --> 00:27:46
Can we do stuff?
 

505
00:27:46 --> 00:27:47
All this sort of stuff.
 

506
00:27:47 --> 00:27:50
This sort of thing doesn't
require a lot of visual aquity

507
00:27:50 --> 00:27:54
and the cat wants to be
able to do it in dim light.

508
00:27:54 --> 00:27:59
So, we have this notion that
cats can see in the dark,

509
00:27:59 --> 00:28:04
which, of course, is not really
true -- no light, no vision.

510
00:28:04 --> 00:28:07
People think cats can see in
the dark because cats can see

511
00:28:07 --> 00:28:10
stuff in dim light that you and
I can't, and part of the reason

512
00:28:10 --> 00:28:15
for that is that they are
willing to let stray photons

513
00:28:15 --> 00:28:16
go where they will.
 

514
00:28:16 --> 00:28:20
Because, in fact, I gave a
sort of a radical example.

515
00:28:20 --> 00:28:25
If my hypothetical photon
missed my hypothetical

516
00:28:25 --> 00:28:29
photoreceptor here, odds are
it's not going to go out to

517
00:28:29 --> 00:28:32
outer Mongolia, it's going to
get absorbed someplace nearby,

518
00:28:32 --> 00:28:35
and so the effect will be a
blurring, not a complete

519
00:28:35 --> 00:28:37
degradation of the image.
 

520
00:28:37 --> 00:28:39
I think the cat can cope.
 

521
00:28:39 --> 00:28:42
The cat doesn't mind too much.
 

522
00:28:42 --> 00:28:51
By the way, if you're
interested in design, taking a

523
00:28:51 --> 00:28:58
look at the design of eyes
across the animal kingdom

524
00:28:58 --> 00:29:01
is a beautiful--.
 

525
00:29:01 --> 00:29:06
The number of different ways
that evolution or the hand of

526
00:29:06 --> 00:29:09
God, you can take your pick,
has chosen to solve the problem

527
00:29:09 --> 00:29:14
of collecting light, an amazing
array of possibilities.

528
00:29:14 --> 00:29:17
Once you start -- cats are
one thing, but you go off

529
00:29:17 --> 00:29:24
into insects and other
beasties and it's great.

530
00:29:24 --> 00:29:25
Wonderful stuff.
 

531
00:29:25 --> 00:29:31
If you want to be an engineer,
probably lots of good

532
00:29:31 --> 00:29:33
industrial design there.
 

533
00:29:33 --> 00:29:37
All right, let me take a quick
trip up into the rest of

534
00:29:37 --> 00:29:40
the visual system here.
 

535
00:29:40 --> 00:29:45
This picture that's up on the
screen now is mimicking the

536
00:29:45 --> 00:29:49
picture on the upper left of
the second page of the handout.

537
00:29:49 --> 00:29:53
It's showing the connections
-- oh, I just remembered.

538
00:29:53 --> 00:29:55
I want to do a quick demo
here before I do that.

539
00:29:55 --> 00:29:56
Let's go back and do that.
 

540
00:29:56 --> 00:29:59
 
 

541
00:29:59 --> 00:30:03
If the retina is on
backwards, you got this

542
00:30:03 --> 00:30:07
interesting problem.
 

543
00:30:07 --> 00:30:12
So, there are those nerve
fibers to the optic nerve.

544
00:30:12 --> 00:30:15
How are they going to get
out of the eye if light

545
00:30:15 --> 00:30:18
is coming from there?
 

546
00:30:18 --> 00:30:27
What they do is they run across
the surface of the retina until

547
00:30:27 --> 00:30:29
they reach the optic nerve and
then they go out

548
00:30:29 --> 00:30:31
up to the brain.
 

549
00:30:31 --> 00:30:34
Where are the photoreceptors
at the optic nerve?

550
00:30:34 --> 00:30:36
The answer is there aren't
any photo receptors

551
00:30:36 --> 00:30:37
at the optic nerve.
 

552
00:30:37 --> 00:30:39
If there aren't any
photoreceptors at the optic

553
00:30:39 --> 00:30:42
nerve, what do you see there?
 

554
00:30:42 --> 00:30:46
The answer isn't nothing
because you're not aware of the

555
00:30:46 --> 00:30:50
fact that there's some big
hole in your visual field.

556
00:30:50 --> 00:30:53
But there is.
 

557
00:30:53 --> 00:30:57
You will automatically fill it
in because if it's green here

558
00:30:57 --> 00:31:00
and green here and there's no
information there, it's a good

559
00:31:00 --> 00:31:02
bet that it's probably green
all the way across and your

560
00:31:02 --> 00:31:04
visual system can
figure this out.

561
00:31:04 --> 00:31:07
But it's worth it to prove
it to yourself that there

562
00:31:07 --> 00:31:09
is a blind spot there.
 

563
00:31:09 --> 00:31:11
Let's see, on the handout --
well, flip to the back of the

564
00:31:11 --> 00:31:19
handout where you got a little
extra white space, and put an x

565
00:31:19 --> 00:31:25
on handout here like this, and
a little ways away like about

566
00:31:25 --> 00:31:27
like that, put a little black
dot or a little dot -- I

567
00:31:27 --> 00:31:28
don't care if it's black.
 

568
00:31:28 --> 00:31:32
 
 

569
00:31:32 --> 00:31:37
So the dot is to the
right of the x.

570
00:31:37 --> 00:31:40
Close the left eye,
cover your left eye.

571
00:31:40 --> 00:31:44
Look at the x, hold it so that
the dot is straight out to the

572
00:31:44 --> 00:31:49
right and then move the paper
back and forth and you will

573
00:31:49 --> 00:31:53
find that there's a spot where
the dot completely disappears.

574
00:31:53 --> 00:31:59
What you've done at that point
is move the dot into the optic

575
00:31:59 --> 00:32:01
nerve head -- the place where
the optic nerve is

576
00:32:01 --> 00:32:02
leaving the eye.
 

577
00:32:02 --> 00:32:07
 
 

578
00:32:07 --> 00:32:11
If you're saying I can't do
this, I don't see a blind spot,

579
00:32:11 --> 00:32:15
it's not because you're special
and don't have one, it's

580
00:32:15 --> 00:32:16
because you're doing it wrong.
 

581
00:32:16 --> 00:32:19
 
 

582
00:32:19 --> 00:32:22
Well, there is an alternative.
 

583
00:32:22 --> 00:32:25
I'm given to understand that
the octopus retina is not put

584
00:32:25 --> 00:32:28
on backwards in this way and
so perhaps you're an octopus.

585
00:32:28 --> 00:32:33
 
 

586
00:32:33 --> 00:32:38
OK, let's go back to this
wiring diagram here.

587
00:32:38 --> 00:32:46
 
 

588
00:32:46 --> 00:32:49
You can play with this later.
 

589
00:32:49 --> 00:32:50
It's cool.
 

590
00:32:50 --> 00:32:53
Do things like -- well, if you
flip it around you can find

591
00:32:53 --> 00:32:55
that you got one in
the other eye, too.

592
00:32:55 --> 00:32:59
You can also do things like
draw a line with a hole in it.

593
00:32:59 --> 00:33:01
If you draw a line with a gap
in it and put the gap in the

594
00:33:01 --> 00:33:04
hole, the line will
appear to complete.

595
00:33:04 --> 00:33:07
If you get really adept at this
you can do what King Charles

596
00:33:07 --> 00:33:10
the Second of England was
reputed to have liked to do,

597
00:33:10 --> 00:33:14
which is you can look at your
friends and put their heads

598
00:33:14 --> 00:33:19
in blind spots and watch
their heads disappear.

599
00:33:19 --> 00:33:23
Charles the Second didn't get
to chop off as many heads as

600
00:33:23 --> 00:33:25
his predecessors had, so
this was the best he

601
00:33:25 --> 00:33:26
could do I guess.
 

602
00:33:26 --> 00:33:28
All right.
 

603
00:33:28 --> 00:33:36
How do the axons from the
optic nerve feed the visual

604
00:33:36 --> 00:33:39
centers of the brain?
 

605
00:33:39 --> 00:33:43
You will recall, from the first
lecture perhaps, that

606
00:33:43 --> 00:33:51
everything from the right side
of my body on the skin senses

607
00:33:51 --> 00:33:55
gets represented in the sensory
homunculus on the left, and

608
00:33:55 --> 00:33:57
everything from the left in the
sensory homunculus

609
00:33:57 --> 00:34:00
on the right.
 

610
00:34:00 --> 00:34:04
The way to not do this
individual system would be to

611
00:34:04 --> 00:34:08
have let's have everything from
the right, that's my right eye,

612
00:34:08 --> 00:34:10
my right eye go to my left
hemisphere, and everything from

613
00:34:10 --> 00:34:12
the left eye go to the
right hemisphere.

614
00:34:12 --> 00:34:14
That wouldn't be any good.
 

615
00:34:14 --> 00:34:17
Isaac Newton figured out
without bothering to do

616
00:34:17 --> 00:34:19
any anatomy, Isaac Newton
figured out that that

617
00:34:19 --> 00:34:20
wouldn't be any good.
 

618
00:34:20 --> 00:34:24
Because I want to look out at
the world with two eyes and

619
00:34:24 --> 00:34:25
I want to see one world.
 

620
00:34:25 --> 00:34:28
So I'm going to have to do
something that brings the

621
00:34:28 --> 00:34:31
information from the
two eyes together.

622
00:34:31 --> 00:34:36
What you actually do
is the following.

623
00:34:36 --> 00:34:41
Everything from the left side
of each retina ends up in the

624
00:34:41 --> 00:34:44
left hemisphere, and everything
from the right side of each

625
00:34:44 --> 00:34:48
retina ends up in the
right hemisphere.

626
00:34:48 --> 00:34:56
The image on eye is flipped --
simple lenses do that, right.

627
00:34:56 --> 00:35:00
So I've got a simple
lens in that anterior

628
00:35:00 --> 00:35:01
portion of my eye.
 

629
00:35:01 --> 00:35:06
That means that the image of
you guys landing on my retain

630
00:35:06 --> 00:35:09
has your feet up, your head
down and left and

631
00:35:09 --> 00:35:10
right reversed.
 

632
00:35:10 --> 00:35:19
So what that means here is if I
stare at the person wearing

633
00:35:19 --> 00:35:23
yellow here -- if I stare at
the person wearing yellow

634
00:35:23 --> 00:35:25
she'll look embarrassed.
 

635
00:35:25 --> 00:35:27
It always works but that's
a different phenomenon.

636
00:35:27 --> 00:35:29
All right, but I'm staring
at you but I'm not actually

637
00:35:29 --> 00:35:30
paying any attention to you.
 

638
00:35:30 --> 00:35:33
What I'm actually doing is
looking at -- my aquity's

639
00:35:33 --> 00:35:37
so bad, it's a black
blob right about there.

640
00:35:37 --> 00:35:42
I assume she's a person --
yeah, she's a person, OK.

641
00:35:42 --> 00:35:44
Anyway, acquity's very bad.
 

642
00:35:44 --> 00:35:47
 
 

643
00:35:47 --> 00:35:52
If you're on my fovea, the
woman to the right is in the

644
00:35:52 --> 00:35:55
right half of my visual field
landing on the left

645
00:35:55 --> 00:35:57
side of my retina.
 

646
00:35:57 --> 00:36:00
She lands on the left side in
both eyes, and as a result,

647
00:36:00 --> 00:36:02
she's landing in my
left hemisphere.

648
00:36:02 --> 00:36:05
If I'm looking at you,
some arbitrary blob --

649
00:36:05 --> 00:36:07
there's a blob that
just moved over there.

650
00:36:07 --> 00:36:10
Oh, she's a person, too.
 

651
00:36:10 --> 00:36:13
This person in the left visual
field ends up on the right

652
00:36:13 --> 00:36:17
retain in each eye and in
the right hemisphere.

653
00:36:17 --> 00:36:20
So there's only one of her, in
a sense, up in my brain, and

654
00:36:20 --> 00:36:26
only one of her up in my brain
and they're getting

655
00:36:26 --> 00:36:27
together in that--.
 

656
00:36:27 --> 00:36:30
And the result is that half the
fibers from each retina have

657
00:36:30 --> 00:36:32
to cross to the other side.
 

658
00:36:32 --> 00:36:40
That's what this cute little
map on page 2 is telling you.

659
00:36:40 --> 00:36:44
But the important thing not to
get confused about is don't

660
00:36:44 --> 00:36:48
tell us on some exam that your
left eye goes to your right

661
00:36:48 --> 00:36:50
hemisphere or something.
 

662
00:36:50 --> 00:36:56
It's left half of each retina
goes to left hemisphere, right

663
00:36:56 --> 00:36:59
half of each retina goes
to the right hemisphere.

664
00:36:59 --> 00:37:09
What it does once it gets there
is -- this is a monkey brain,

665
00:37:09 --> 00:37:15
and what you're looking at is
the cortical surface here.

666
00:37:15 --> 00:37:17
That must be the outside
surface and this is the inner

667
00:37:17 --> 00:37:21
surface of the hemisphere, if
there are two hemispheres.

668
00:37:21 --> 00:37:23
The one on the bottom is
looking at the inside surface.

669
00:37:23 --> 00:37:26
The colored areas are ones
that are important in vision.

670
00:37:26 --> 00:37:30
I talked at the beginning about
the fact that primary visual

671
00:37:30 --> 00:37:32
cortex is right here at the
back of the brain, but it's

672
00:37:32 --> 00:37:38
amazing how much of the
brain is devoted to vision.

673
00:37:38 --> 00:37:40
It's very hard to look at
in a picture -- well, it's

674
00:37:40 --> 00:37:42
very hard look at, period.
 

675
00:37:42 --> 00:37:46
What vision researchers like to
do is to make maps like this

676
00:37:46 --> 00:37:52
where you take the cortical
surface and flatten it -- it's

677
00:37:52 --> 00:37:59
all this wrinkley involuted
structure -- use a variety of

678
00:37:59 --> 00:38:01
techniques to flatten
it out like a map.

679
00:38:01 --> 00:38:04
Then you see that this is the
piece that's at the back

680
00:38:04 --> 00:38:06
of the head, the one
primary visual cortex.

681
00:38:06 --> 00:38:11
Then you've got all these
gazillion other regions that

682
00:38:11 --> 00:38:16
are important in visual
processing, some of them for

683
00:38:16 --> 00:38:17
rather precise sort of things.
 

684
00:38:17 --> 00:38:19
Where did mt go?
 

685
00:38:19 --> 00:38:23
 
 

686
00:38:23 --> 00:38:28
I think right there is mt, for
example, which is important

687
00:38:28 --> 00:38:30
in motion processing.
 

688
00:38:30 --> 00:38:32
Lots of work being done
trying to figure out what

689
00:38:32 --> 00:38:34
different bits of it do.
 

690
00:38:34 --> 00:38:38
Look, let me give you a
broad organizing scheme for

691
00:38:38 --> 00:38:41
how to think about this.
 

692
00:38:41 --> 00:38:44
It's not perfect
but it ain't bad.

693
00:38:44 --> 00:38:48
From primary visual cortex
where very basic information

694
00:38:48 --> 00:38:53
about spots and lines and
primitive bits of motion gets

695
00:38:53 --> 00:38:59
pulled out, more advanced
processing can be thought of

696
00:38:59 --> 00:39:01
as in two large streams.
 

697
00:39:01 --> 00:39:07
One large stream going up
towards the parietal lobe is

698
00:39:07 --> 00:39:12
telling you things about
where stuff is in the world.

699
00:39:12 --> 00:39:14
How is the world laid out?
 

700
00:39:14 --> 00:39:20
So, my notion that this space
is laid out as a big slanted

701
00:39:20 --> 00:39:27
plane in front of me is
probably a product of

702
00:39:27 --> 00:39:30
this sort of a pathway.
 

703
00:39:30 --> 00:39:37
A second pathway going down
into the temporal lobe is

704
00:39:37 --> 00:39:42
very concerned with what
stimuli it might be.

705
00:39:42 --> 00:39:48
So there, if you're a monkey
and I spear individual cells,

706
00:39:48 --> 00:39:50
it might be where I would find
a cell that was particularly

707
00:39:50 --> 00:39:56
interested in a hand, a monkey
hand, or a hairy leg or

708
00:39:56 --> 00:39:58
something like that.
 

709
00:39:58 --> 00:40:01
It turns out that the hairy
part can be important.

710
00:40:01 --> 00:40:03
 
 

711
00:40:03 --> 00:40:07
Some of the work on things like
monkey hand detectors was being

712
00:40:07 --> 00:40:14
done by one of my professors at
Princeton, and actually my TA

713
00:40:14 --> 00:40:18
in intro psych, when I was an
undergrad, was a grad student

714
00:40:18 --> 00:40:21
who was working on this, and he
reported to us that he was

715
00:40:21 --> 00:40:24
recording -- you
go spear a cell.

716
00:40:24 --> 00:40:26
It's one thing if you're just
trying to figure out if it

717
00:40:26 --> 00:40:30
likes spots of light, but how
do you figure out if the cell

718
00:40:30 --> 00:40:32
likes something like a hand.
 

719
00:40:32 --> 00:40:37
Well, they had in those days
drawers full of stuff and you

720
00:40:37 --> 00:40:40
waved all this stuff in
front of the monkey and see

721
00:40:40 --> 00:40:43
what makes the cell go.
 

722
00:40:43 --> 00:40:46
These experiments in the good
old days tended to run for very

723
00:40:46 --> 00:40:50
long time, because this was an
anesthetized monkey and the

724
00:40:50 --> 00:40:52
monkey wasn't going to wake up
from this particular operation.

725
00:40:52 --> 00:40:56
You ran the experiment for days
and days and days and you

726
00:40:56 --> 00:40:58
stayed up the whole time.
 

727
00:40:58 --> 00:41:03
So, Bob Desimone, now a famous
visual neuroscientist is up

728
00:41:03 --> 00:41:08
late at night with this stupid
monkey with his stupid cell and

729
00:41:08 --> 00:41:10
the cell isn't doing anything.
 

730
00:41:10 --> 00:41:11
He's waving everything at it.
 

731
00:41:11 --> 00:41:16
So finally, he took off his
pants, wrapped a towel around

732
00:41:16 --> 00:41:20
his waist and did a little
dance in front of the monkey.

733
00:41:20 --> 00:41:21
The cell went nuts.
 

734
00:41:21 --> 00:41:25
 
 

735
00:41:25 --> 00:41:29
Being a good scientist, he then
narrowed this down to the

736
00:41:29 --> 00:41:31
notion that this was a cell
that actually seem to be

737
00:41:31 --> 00:41:36
interested in hairy legs, and
the hairy part turned

738
00:41:36 --> 00:41:38
out to be important.
 

739
00:41:38 --> 00:41:43
I feel free to tell this story
about Bob Desimone because Bob

740
00:41:43 --> 00:41:47
Desimone is running around the
country with a talk at the

741
00:41:47 --> 00:41:50
moment that has a picture of
me in it kissing a wombat.

742
00:41:50 --> 00:41:53
 
 

743
00:41:53 --> 00:41:55
Don't ask.
 

744
00:41:55 --> 00:41:58
It all seems fair to me.
 

745
00:41:58 --> 00:42:03
All right, so if you go up
into, way down here in the

746
00:42:03 --> 00:42:09
temporal lobe, you might find
cells that respond only to

747
00:42:09 --> 00:42:11
something like a hairy
leg or a monkey hand or

748
00:42:11 --> 00:42:12
something like that.
 

749
00:42:12 --> 00:42:19
If you're hanging out back here
in primary visual cortex --

750
00:42:19 --> 00:42:22
well, actually let's
go back and hang out

751
00:42:22 --> 00:42:24
in the retina even.
 

752
00:42:24 --> 00:42:26
Look at that, we'll
hang out right there.

753
00:42:26 --> 00:42:33
If you're hanging out in the
retina, if you like much

754
00:42:33 --> 00:42:38
simpler needs than this hairy
leg detector somewhere up in

755
00:42:38 --> 00:42:46
the temporal lobe, I mentioned
before that you might be

756
00:42:46 --> 00:42:53
bringing together a whole bunch
of photoreceptors through, say,

757
00:42:53 --> 00:42:59
a bipolar cell to a ganglion
cell, to bring together a

758
00:42:59 --> 00:43:03
whole bunch of them to send a
signal off to the brain.

759
00:43:03 --> 00:43:06
But what I didn't mention is
that not all the photoreceptors

760
00:43:06 --> 00:43:09
that are hooked up to
stimulated ganglion cell are

761
00:43:09 --> 00:43:11
going to excite that cell.
 

762
00:43:11 --> 00:43:15
Let's draw some
pictures over here.

763
00:43:15 --> 00:43:21
What actually happens, and I'm
just going to mimic this over

764
00:43:21 --> 00:43:30
here, is that you'd have some
photoreceptors who are set up

765
00:43:30 --> 00:43:35
to excite a ganglion cell.
 

766
00:43:35 --> 00:43:39
Then some other guys around
them who would be set

767
00:43:39 --> 00:43:45
up to inhibit it.
 

768
00:43:45 --> 00:43:52
 
 

769
00:43:52 --> 00:43:56
The result is that what
this cell -- that's a

770
00:43:56 --> 00:43:59
one-dimensional slice and this
would be a two-dimensional

771
00:43:59 --> 00:44:02
picture -- the retina's after
all a two-dimensional surface.

772
00:44:02 --> 00:44:12
So what you'd really get is
some region of photoreceptors

773
00:44:12 --> 00:44:17
that excite the cell, and some
surrounding region where light

774
00:44:17 --> 00:44:21
inhibits the subsequent
ganglion cell.

775
00:44:21 --> 00:44:27
Then light out here
does nothing.

776
00:44:27 --> 00:44:30
So this is the receptive field
of this cell -- this is the

777
00:44:30 --> 00:44:33
only part of the retina
that this cell over

778
00:44:33 --> 00:44:37
here cares about.
 

779
00:44:37 --> 00:44:41
It's going to send its
signal off to the brain.

780
00:44:41 --> 00:44:42
What does this cell do?
 

781
00:44:42 --> 00:44:45
Well, among the things that
this cell can do is it can tell

782
00:44:45 --> 00:44:52
you I am most excited by a
spot that's exacty this size.

783
00:44:52 --> 00:44:55
If the spot gets any bigger
it's going to encroach on

784
00:44:55 --> 00:44:58
this inhibitory stuff and
reduce my excitation.

785
00:44:58 --> 00:45:04
If the spot's any smaller, I'm
not going to get all of my

786
00:45:04 --> 00:45:08
excitatory guys excited, and
the response will get smaller.

787
00:45:08 --> 00:45:12
So I'm most excited by a
spot of exactly this size.

788
00:45:12 --> 00:45:17
If I build receptors with
different size centers, this

789
00:45:17 --> 00:45:20
guy's only going to be excited
by a little spot and I could

790
00:45:20 --> 00:45:23
make one that would be
excited by a bigger spot.

791
00:45:23 --> 00:45:27
So, even at the level of the
retina, you can start to get

792
00:45:27 --> 00:45:31
cells that are telling you more
than just light on, light off,

793
00:45:31 --> 00:45:34
they're starting to tell you
something about the size of

794
00:45:34 --> 00:45:39
things in the visual field.
 

795
00:45:39 --> 00:45:46
When you get up to the cortex,
you find that now cells come to

796
00:45:46 --> 00:45:51
be interested in things like
lines -- not just a

797
00:45:51 --> 00:45:53
spot but a line.
 

798
00:45:53 --> 00:45:58
And this cell will way, I like
lines in this orientation.

799
00:45:58 --> 00:46:01
I don't like lines in
this orientation.

800
00:46:01 --> 00:46:03
In fact, I like lines in this
orientation only if they

801
00:46:03 --> 00:46:05
move this direction.
 

802
00:46:05 --> 00:46:08
So you can imagine that what
you start to do early in the

803
00:46:08 --> 00:46:16
visual system is to pull out a
whole bunch of little features,

804
00:46:16 --> 00:46:21
if you like, that you can then
use subsequently to try to

805
00:46:21 --> 00:46:25
figure out is there
a monkey hand here.

806
00:46:25 --> 00:46:31
Is there a laptop computer
or something like that.

807
00:46:31 --> 00:46:37
Early in the system you've
got basic features being

808
00:46:37 --> 00:46:38
pulled out of the image.
 

809
00:46:38 --> 00:46:41
Now, this presents a problem.
 

810
00:46:41 --> 00:46:45
Suppose that what you want
to do -- Let's start

811
00:46:45 --> 00:46:46
with orientation.
 

812
00:46:46 --> 00:46:49
Suppose you want to
decide that a line is a

813
00:46:49 --> 00:46:50
particular orientation.
 

814
00:46:50 --> 00:46:52
How good are you at that?
 

815
00:46:52 --> 00:46:58
The answer turns out to be that
you are good enough to be

816
00:46:58 --> 00:47:03
able to tell roughly
1 degree increments.

817
00:47:03 --> 00:47:04
How are you going to do that?
 

818
00:47:04 --> 00:47:07
Well you could have a cell
specifically designed to look

819
00:47:07 --> 00:47:11
for zero degrees vertical, 1
degree, 2 degree, 3 degree, 4

820
00:47:11 --> 00:47:14
degree, and you need one of
those everywhere in the visual

821
00:47:14 --> 00:47:18
field, and at all different
sizes -- a little line that's

822
00:47:18 --> 00:47:19
vertical, a big line
that's vertical.

823
00:47:19 --> 00:47:22
You're going to need an
awful lot of cells then.

824
00:47:22 --> 00:47:25
That's not what we do.
 

825
00:47:25 --> 00:47:29
What we seem to do all over the
place in the visual system, and

826
00:47:29 --> 00:47:35
in sensory systems in general,
is to make comparisons.

827
00:47:35 --> 00:47:40
That comparisons are very
powerful in this game.

828
00:47:40 --> 00:47:43
So how do you decide that
something's vertical?

829
00:47:43 --> 00:47:46
To a first approximation what
you do is you look at whether

830
00:47:46 --> 00:47:49
or not the lift-tilted guys and
the right-tilted guys, the

831
00:47:49 --> 00:47:54
cells that like stuff -- the
cells that look for something

832
00:47:54 --> 00:47:56
that's tilted a little to
the right, cells that are

833
00:47:56 --> 00:47:58
interested in stuff that
are tilted to the left.

834
00:47:58 --> 00:48:01
Are they roughly
equally excited?

835
00:48:01 --> 00:48:04
If they're roughly equally
excited in balance one with the

836
00:48:04 --> 00:48:14
other, then odds are that
you're looking at a

837
00:48:14 --> 00:48:16
vertical stimulus.
 

838
00:48:16 --> 00:48:18
OK?
 

839
00:48:18 --> 00:48:22
If the right-tilted stuff is
stronger than the left-tilted

840
00:48:22 --> 00:48:24
stuff, so that balance gets
tiled, you're going to say

841
00:48:24 --> 00:48:27
that the stimulus is tilted.
 

842
00:48:27 --> 00:48:36
It turns out that if you do
something to make -- let's say

843
00:48:36 --> 00:48:42
you go off and you make the
left-tilted stuff weak by

844
00:48:42 --> 00:48:44
tiring it out -- how do you
tire it out, you show it a

845
00:48:44 --> 00:48:47
bunch of left, show it a bunch
of left lines, that

846
00:48:47 --> 00:48:48
makes this weaker.
 

847
00:48:48 --> 00:48:50
Then something that's
vertical's going to turn out to

848
00:48:50 --> 00:48:53
look tilted to the -- you're
not going to believe that.

849
00:48:53 --> 00:48:55
Let me show this to you.
 

850
00:48:55 --> 00:49:01
I'll show it to you in --
I'm going to jump to here.

851
00:49:01 --> 00:49:05
Well, we'll jump here first.
 

852
00:49:05 --> 00:49:05
OK.
 

853
00:49:05 --> 00:49:11
Here are a very boring picture.
 

854
00:49:11 --> 00:49:13
It will be even more boring
if I turn out a little

855
00:49:13 --> 00:49:15
more of the lights here.
 

856
00:49:15 --> 00:49:18
 
 

857
00:49:18 --> 00:49:20
OK.
 

858
00:49:20 --> 00:49:24
How you know that something's
white or grey or achromatic?

859
00:49:24 --> 00:49:27
Again, in this case you've got
color mechanisms that say

860
00:49:27 --> 00:49:33
how red or green is this?
 

861
00:49:33 --> 00:49:36
If the answer is well, it's
balanced between red and

862
00:49:36 --> 00:49:44
green, and you also ask how
blue or yellow is this?

863
00:49:44 --> 00:49:46
If it's not blue and it's not
yellow and it's not red and

864
00:49:46 --> 00:49:50
it's not green, well, you know
what it's probably white.

865
00:49:50 --> 00:49:53
OK, well, so here let's take
this red/green thing and

866
00:49:53 --> 00:49:59
let's make the green side
weak by wearing it out.

867
00:49:59 --> 00:50:02
We'll show you some green.
 

868
00:50:02 --> 00:50:04
Now I'm going to show you
something white -- the green is

869
00:50:04 --> 00:50:08
weak, the red is strong, the
balance goes this way, and you

870
00:50:08 --> 00:50:11
think that something that was
once white now looks

871
00:50:11 --> 00:50:14
kind of green.
 

872
00:50:14 --> 00:50:17
There, see, isn't that amazing?
 

873
00:50:17 --> 00:50:19
They're not convinced.
 

874
00:50:19 --> 00:50:22
The ones who are
convinced are confused.

875
00:50:22 --> 00:50:26
Stare at the black dot
at the center here.

876
00:50:26 --> 00:50:30
You just want to stare at the
black dot and think about, say,

877
00:50:30 --> 00:50:32
that red dot up at 12 o'clock.
 

878
00:50:32 --> 00:50:35
What you're doing is you're
tiring out the red side of this

879
00:50:35 --> 00:50:38
red/green equation in this
particular case, and just keep

880
00:50:38 --> 00:50:43
staring there, and then
I'm going to go boink.

881
00:50:43 --> 00:50:51
 
 

882
00:50:51 --> 00:50:56
So, the people who went "oh,"
presumably saw colors.

883
00:50:56 --> 00:50:59
Let's do that again, here.
 

884
00:50:59 --> 00:51:10
What you want to notice is that
the color is this opposite

885
00:51:10 --> 00:51:11
color, it's going the
other direction.

886
00:51:11 --> 00:51:14
So the red one will turn green,
the yellow one will turn

887
00:51:14 --> 00:51:16
bluish, the green one will
turn reddish, right.

888
00:51:16 --> 00:51:18
So stare at the center, boink.
 

889
00:51:18 --> 00:51:21
 
 

890
00:51:21 --> 00:51:23
It works.
 

891
00:51:23 --> 00:51:26
 
 

892
00:51:26 --> 00:51:29
That's what's known as a
negative after image.

893
00:51:29 --> 00:51:31
 
 

894
00:51:31 --> 00:51:33
You can just toggle
back and forth.

895
00:51:33 --> 00:51:41
If you look at the black dot on
the right and then move your

896
00:51:41 --> 00:51:44
eyes to the left, you'll see
the colors show up in the left

897
00:51:44 --> 00:51:47
hand circles, because that
after image is essentially

898
00:51:47 --> 00:51:50
cooked onto your retina -- it's
there in retinal coordinates

899
00:51:50 --> 00:51:54
and moves with your eyes.
 

900
00:51:54 --> 00:51:58
Alright, now let me illustrate
to you that this is a

901
00:51:58 --> 00:52:02
ubiquitous phenomenon that
shows up for basic phenomena

902
00:52:02 --> 00:52:08
all over the place by
turning this back on.

903
00:52:08 --> 00:52:09
Is that going to be
enough light for this?

904
00:52:09 --> 00:52:12
 
 

905
00:52:12 --> 00:52:15
So, I won't show you the
orientation one, even though I

906
00:52:15 --> 00:52:19
managed to get a PhD studying
it, but I'll show you the

907
00:52:19 --> 00:52:22
motion equivalent of it.
 

908
00:52:22 --> 00:52:23
Here's what you want to do.
 

909
00:52:23 --> 00:52:26
 
 

910
00:52:26 --> 00:52:28
You'll still see it over there,
except for the guy who's

911
00:52:28 --> 00:52:30
asleep behind the pillar,
that's his tough luck.

912
00:52:30 --> 00:52:38
 
 

913
00:52:38 --> 00:52:42
So, look at this, and we're
doing the same game.

914
00:52:42 --> 00:52:45
We're just taking the game and
transferring from the color

915
00:52:45 --> 00:52:47
realm, or the orientation
realm, down to the

916
00:52:47 --> 00:52:48
motion realm.
 

917
00:52:48 --> 00:52:51
So this is contracting, right?
 

918
00:52:51 --> 00:52:53
Stare at the center,
that's important.

919
00:52:53 --> 00:52:54
So stare at the center.
 

920
00:52:54 --> 00:52:57
Again, think about 12 o'clock.
 

921
00:52:57 --> 00:52:59
All the contours
are moving down.

922
00:52:59 --> 00:53:02
You know that something's
stationary because it's not

923
00:53:02 --> 00:53:04
moving up, down, left or right.
 

924
00:53:04 --> 00:53:07
But at 12 o'clock I'm wearing
out your down detectors, and

925
00:53:07 --> 00:53:11
at 6 o'clock I'm wearing out
your up detectors and so on.

926
00:53:11 --> 00:53:17
The consequences of this evil
act of mine will be seen

927
00:53:17 --> 00:53:20
vividly if, when I take it
away, what you do is

928
00:53:20 --> 00:53:22
look at my nose.
 

929
00:53:22 --> 00:53:41
 
 

930
00:53:41 --> 00:53:47
Of course, what really worries
me here is several people's

931
00:53:47 --> 00:53:48
pupils got much larger,
which means they think

932
00:53:48 --> 00:53:51
I look better that way.
 

933
00:53:51 --> 00:53:53
 
 

934
00:53:53 --> 00:53:57
Now, a word of warning.
 

935
00:53:57 --> 00:53:58
Two words of warning.
 

936
00:53:58 --> 00:54:00
This is the best demo
in the whole class.

937
00:54:00 --> 00:54:02
It's all downhill from here.
 

938
00:54:02 --> 00:54:06
The other word of warning is
it's a very salient demo, but

939
00:54:06 --> 00:54:10
it's there for a purpose.
 

940
00:54:10 --> 00:54:14
It's really lame on the
mid-term or the final when some

941
00:54:14 --> 00:54:16
motion -- this is called a
motion after effect -- when a

942
00:54:16 --> 00:54:20
motion after effect question
shows up to say oh, that was

943
00:54:20 --> 00:54:24
cool, man, his head was
shrinking and stuff.

944
00:54:24 --> 00:54:26
Because you don't get
much points for that.

945
00:54:26 --> 00:54:30
What you want to know is why
this is actually interesting,

946
00:54:30 --> 00:54:33
which I will reiterate by going
the other direction since it

947
00:54:33 --> 00:54:36
seems a pity not to, right?
 

948
00:54:36 --> 00:54:40
OK, so again, the way you
figure out that something is,

949
00:54:40 --> 00:54:43
in this case, stationary is by
making a set of comparisons,

950
00:54:43 --> 00:54:48
and Iam using this clever
little tool to systematically

951
00:54:48 --> 00:54:51
distort the comparisons
that you're making.

952
00:54:51 --> 00:54:53
By the way, I'm also causing
you to make one of these

953
00:54:53 --> 00:54:57
inferences that we'll
talk about next week.

954
00:54:57 --> 00:55:00
By seeing all these various
bits of odd motion, you are

955
00:55:00 --> 00:55:03
making the conclusion that my
head is shrinking or growing

956
00:55:03 --> 00:55:04
or something like that.
 

957
00:55:04 --> 00:55:07
So this is expanding, right,
so this is the amazing

958
00:55:07 --> 00:55:08
pinhead version.
 

959
00:55:08 --> 00:55:09
Ready?
 

960
00:55:09 --> 00:55:19
 
 

961
00:55:19 --> 00:55:25
The original version of this,
by the way, is known in the

962
00:55:25 --> 00:55:29
literature as sometimes it's
the waterfall illusion, because

963
00:55:29 --> 00:55:33
it gets described multiple
times in the literature, but

964
00:55:33 --> 00:55:40
one of them is by a Scotsman
named Adams who was staring at

965
00:55:40 --> 00:55:44
a waterfall and then noticed
that the rocks on the side of

966
00:55:44 --> 00:55:46
the waterfall seem
to be drifting up.

967
00:55:46 --> 00:55:50
This is a known waterfall in a
known spot in Scotland and

968
00:55:50 --> 00:55:52
there's a group of vision
researchers who meet there

969
00:55:52 --> 00:55:57
every year and the entry
requirement for joining this

970
00:55:57 --> 00:56:01
particular elite group is a
bottle of scotch of a variety

971
00:56:01 --> 00:56:04
that they have not tried
before, which I think helps

972
00:56:04 --> 00:56:08
make the rocks move in all
sorts of interesting ways.

973
00:56:08 --> 00:56:13
They've never invited me
so how would I know.

974
00:56:13 --> 00:56:15
OK, this is what
I'm going to do.

975
00:56:15 --> 00:56:17
Let me follow up.
 

976
00:56:17 --> 00:56:21
So you've seen a negative
color after image.

977
00:56:21 --> 00:56:25
You've seen a negative
motion after effect.

978
00:56:25 --> 00:56:29
I've asserted that these
exist in orientation.

979
00:56:29 --> 00:56:32
You can show this often -- you
show somebody big stuff and

980
00:56:32 --> 00:56:33
then medium stuff looks small.
 

981
00:56:33 --> 00:56:34
It's ubiquitous.
 

982
00:56:34 --> 00:56:36
It shows up all over the place.
 

983
00:56:36 --> 00:56:39
I want to show you one more
version of this kind of a

984
00:56:39 --> 00:56:42
effect, and that's going to
take a certain amount

985
00:56:42 --> 00:56:45
of build-up here.
 

986
00:56:45 --> 00:56:48
So the first thing to do is say
the vertical and horizontal

987
00:56:48 --> 00:56:52
stripes, do they look
different to you?

988
00:56:52 --> 00:56:54
If they look different somebody
raise their hand and tell

989
00:56:54 --> 00:56:55
me what the difference is.
 

990
00:56:55 --> 00:56:56
What's the difference?
 

991
00:56:56 --> 00:56:56
AUDIENCE: The
 

992
00:56:56 --> 00:56:57
horizontal ones are horizontal.
 

993
00:56:57 --> 00:57:02
PROFESSOR: Yeah, alright.
 

994
00:57:02 --> 00:57:05
In their color or shading
in some fashion.

995
00:57:05 --> 00:57:05
Yeah?
 

996
00:57:05 --> 00:57:07
AUDIENCE: The vertical
ones look blurry.

997
00:57:07 --> 00:57:09
PROFESSOR: The vertical ones
look a little -- they do

998
00:57:09 --> 00:57:12
look a little blurry.
 

999
00:57:12 --> 00:57:12
Yeah?
 

1000
00:57:12 --> 00:57:15
AUDIENCE: The vertical ones
-- the black lines look

1001
00:57:15 --> 00:57:16
like they're thicker
than the ones--.

1002
00:57:16 --> 00:57:18
PROFESSOR: Well, we're not
getting a lot of vivid

1003
00:57:18 --> 00:57:19
color reports here.
 

1004
00:57:19 --> 00:57:22
AUDIENCE: The horizontal
lines look brighter.

1005
00:57:22 --> 00:57:23
PROFESSOR: Brighter?
 

1006
00:57:23 --> 00:57:26
Nobody knows what the
word color means.

1007
00:57:26 --> 00:57:27
Last try.
 

1008
00:57:27 --> 00:57:33
AUDIENCE: The horizontal
lines are greyer and the

1009
00:57:33 --> 00:57:34
vertical lines are black.
 

1010
00:57:34 --> 00:57:38
PROFESSOR: OK, look, this
makes the point just fine.

1011
00:57:38 --> 00:57:40
Never mind guys.
 

1012
00:57:40 --> 00:57:42
There is no in general
consensus here.

1013
00:57:42 --> 00:57:45
I'm about to produce
a general consensus.

1014
00:57:45 --> 00:57:49
 
 

1015
00:57:49 --> 00:57:51
That's the motivational
part of today's lecture.

1016
00:57:51 --> 00:57:57
No, actually what I have to do
now is for the next few minutes

1017
00:57:57 --> 00:57:59
what you want to do is
keep your head upright.

1018
00:57:59 --> 00:58:02
You don't have to stare
at any one spot.

1019
00:58:02 --> 00:58:03
You don't even have to your
head upright, just keep it

1020
00:58:03 --> 00:58:05
in the same orientation.
 

1021
00:58:05 --> 00:58:08
If you flop all over the
place and fall asleep

1022
00:58:08 --> 00:58:10
nothing good happens.
 

1023
00:58:10 --> 00:58:12
So you're going to look at
these green vertical lines and

1024
00:58:12 --> 00:58:14
these red horizontal lines.
 

1025
00:58:14 --> 00:58:20
 
 

1026
00:58:20 --> 00:58:25
All I need to do here is toggle
back and forth between them.

1027
00:58:25 --> 00:58:28
Now you can see the
negative after image here.

1028
00:58:28 --> 00:58:30
If you stare at this green
-- oh, I should have done

1029
00:58:30 --> 00:58:32
that quickly before.
 

1030
00:58:32 --> 00:58:34
So stare at this green
thing for a while.

1031
00:58:34 --> 00:58:38
You get an nice
purply red thing?

1032
00:58:38 --> 00:58:39
OK.
 

1033
00:58:39 --> 00:58:42
So that's just the
negative after image.

1034
00:58:42 --> 00:58:48
But we're not interested in the
negative after image anymore.

1035
00:58:48 --> 00:58:50
Actually, we are.
 

1036
00:58:50 --> 00:58:53
There's an aspect of the
negative after image that's

1037
00:58:53 --> 00:59:01
really cool here, which you
may start to notice shortly.

1038
00:59:01 --> 00:59:05
During the blank period,
shout out the orientation

1039
00:59:05 --> 00:59:06
that you see.
 

1040
00:59:06 --> 00:59:14
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]
 

1041
00:59:14 --> 00:59:18
PROFESSOR: That's
a little weird.

1042
00:59:18 --> 00:59:20
Wouldn't you think?
 

1043
00:59:20 --> 00:59:26
Now that's a little weird
because if you stare at these

1044
00:59:26 --> 00:59:28
horizontal stripes -- in fact,
I should be able to get you

1045
00:59:28 --> 00:59:29
back to seeing horizontal.
 

1046
00:59:29 --> 00:59:32
So, stare at these -- fixate,
don't move your eyes around

1047
00:59:32 --> 00:59:37
and we'll just stare at
that for a minute or so.

1048
00:59:37 --> 00:59:40
 
 

1049
00:59:40 --> 00:59:43
Has it been long enough?
 

1050
00:59:43 --> 00:59:44
Yeah.
 

1051
00:59:44 --> 00:59:46
Does it look horizontal?
 

1052
00:59:46 --> 00:59:49
Still looks vertical, oh boy.
 

1053
00:59:49 --> 00:59:58
Well, here's the get rich quick
part of this lecture, assuming

1054
00:59:58 --> 01:00:02
that you're unscrupulous, you
can use this to make your

1055
01:00:02 --> 01:00:05
fortune claiming that you can
teach people to be

1056
01:00:05 --> 01:00:07
psychic, right.
 

1057
01:00:07 --> 01:00:10
What's the next orientation
I'm going to show?

1058
01:00:10 --> 01:00:12
What's the next orientation
I'm going to show?

1059
01:00:12 --> 01:00:16
 
 

1060
01:00:16 --> 01:00:21
If you can make your fortune
out of that, just send me 10%.

1061
01:00:21 --> 01:00:27
But what's really going on
here, what this is actually

1062
01:00:27 --> 01:00:31
illustrating, this aspect of it
is illustrating, is that you're

1063
01:00:31 --> 01:00:34
seeing with your whole visual
system, not with your

1064
01:00:34 --> 01:00:37
retina all by itself or
something like that.

1065
01:00:37 --> 01:00:41
So, each time you look, say,
the red horizontal, you're

1066
01:00:41 --> 01:00:44
building up a green horizontal
negative after image

1067
01:00:44 --> 01:00:46
on your retina, right?
 

1068
01:00:46 --> 01:00:49
And this is building up a
red vertical kind of after

1069
01:00:49 --> 01:00:50
image on your retina.
 

1070
01:00:50 --> 01:00:58
If you go back and forth, you
build up sort of a plaid.

1071
01:00:58 --> 01:01:02
So think about your retina
as having a plaid on it.

1072
01:01:02 --> 01:01:07
Now you don't see it here, but
the plaid is -- when you're

1073
01:01:07 --> 01:01:09
looking at a blank screen, it's
just that plaid that's getting

1074
01:01:09 --> 01:01:12
shipped up to your
brain, basically.

1075
01:01:12 --> 01:01:14
OK, well what else
is happening?

1076
01:01:14 --> 01:01:17
Well, when you're staring at
this green vertical thing, up

1077
01:01:17 --> 01:01:20
in your brain the cells that
are interested in vertical are

1078
01:01:20 --> 01:01:22
saying we're getting tired.
 

1079
01:01:22 --> 01:01:26
Go to the blank part, tired
vertical guys and more awake

1080
01:01:26 --> 01:01:29
horizontal guys are looking
at this weak plaid and

1081
01:01:29 --> 01:01:30
they're only seeing
the horizontal part.

1082
01:01:30 --> 01:01:33
Now you look at the horizontal,
the horizontal guys get tired

1083
01:01:33 --> 01:01:36
out -- oh, we can only see
the vertical, and so on.

1084
01:01:36 --> 01:01:39
 
 

1085
01:01:39 --> 01:01:42
You may ask isn't it about
time we saw something

1086
01:01:42 --> 01:01:45
interesting here?
 

1087
01:01:45 --> 01:01:48
The answer is undoubtedly so,
but this particular effect

1088
01:01:48 --> 01:01:55
takes a few minutes to
build up, and so you gotta

1089
01:01:55 --> 01:01:59
keep looking at this.
 

1090
01:01:59 --> 01:02:06
Oh, you've got to ask yourself
what the effects ought to be.

1091
01:02:06 --> 01:02:08
What I'm building up here is an
effect called the McCullough

1092
01:02:08 --> 01:02:13
Effect, named after Celeste
McCullough, who unlike most

1093
01:02:13 --> 01:02:18
people who discover visual
effects, was actually

1094
01:02:18 --> 01:02:21
looking for this.
 

1095
01:02:21 --> 01:02:23
She knew what she was
looking for and she knew

1096
01:02:23 --> 01:02:24
what she could find.
 

1097
01:02:24 --> 01:02:26
Now I already showed you that
the pattern you're going to

1098
01:02:26 --> 01:02:28
look at again, right, it was
that black and white pattern of

1099
01:02:28 --> 01:02:31
vertical and horizontal lines.
 

1100
01:02:31 --> 01:02:34
What do you think the
vertical lines should look

1101
01:02:34 --> 01:02:37
like when we're done?
 

1102
01:02:37 --> 01:02:38
They should look kind
of reddish maybe.

1103
01:02:38 --> 01:02:40
The horizontal should look?
 

1104
01:02:40 --> 01:02:41
AUDIENCE: Green.
 

1105
01:02:41 --> 01:02:41
PROFESSOR: Green.
 

1106
01:02:41 --> 01:02:43
Let's see, well we might
have done this long enough.

1107
01:02:43 --> 01:02:46
This is one of these things
where if I do it long enough I

1108
01:02:46 --> 01:02:51
can hit absolutely everybody,
and if I quit too soon not

1109
01:02:51 --> 01:02:52
everybody will see the effect.
 

1110
01:02:52 --> 01:02:58
 
 

1111
01:02:58 --> 01:02:59
All right, here we go.
 

1112
01:02:59 --> 01:03:02
So, close your eyes, because
that will let me get to the

1113
01:03:02 --> 01:03:05
right slide, but it will also
let you perhaps see that

1114
01:03:05 --> 01:03:08
checkerboard floating
there in the dark?

1115
01:03:08 --> 01:03:09
Murmur if you can see a
checkerboard floating

1116
01:03:09 --> 01:03:11
in the dark.
 

1117
01:03:11 --> 01:03:11
OK, good.
 

1118
01:03:11 --> 01:03:13
That's that's the negative
after image thing.

1119
01:03:13 --> 01:03:16
OK, now take a look at
this test pattern again.

1120
01:03:16 --> 01:03:20
 
 

1121
01:03:20 --> 01:03:22
How many people think that the
vertical and horizontal look

1122
01:03:22 --> 01:03:27
different now in terms
of their color?

1123
01:03:27 --> 01:03:30
How many people think it might
look a little sort of maybe

1124
01:03:30 --> 01:03:32
kind of different, but it's not
exactly biting me

1125
01:03:32 --> 01:03:35
on the posterier?
 

1126
01:03:35 --> 01:03:37
Alright, that's a better test.
 

1127
01:03:37 --> 01:03:39
Now, the way to find out
whether you've actually got

1128
01:03:39 --> 01:03:43
the right effect is without
knocking out your neighbor,

1129
01:03:43 --> 01:03:45
tilt your head 90 degrees.
 

1130
01:03:45 --> 01:03:50
 
 

1131
01:03:50 --> 01:03:51
So that's cooler.
 

1132
01:03:51 --> 01:04:10
 
 

1133
01:04:10 --> 01:04:13
I'll say a word more about
this, but I won't say a word

1134
01:04:13 --> 01:04:17
more about this until you've
had a chance to get up and

1135
01:04:17 --> 01:04:18
stretch for a second.
 

1136
01:04:18 --> 01:05:11
 
 

1137
01:05:11 --> 01:05:16
OK.
 

1138
01:05:16 --> 01:05:28
 
 

1139
01:05:28 --> 01:05:37
How many people when they look
at these dots still see

1140
01:05:37 --> 01:05:38
reasonably compelling colors?
 

1141
01:05:38 --> 01:05:42
 
 

1142
01:05:42 --> 01:05:43
Not many.
 

1143
01:05:43 --> 01:05:46
How many people when they
look at my head still

1144
01:05:46 --> 01:05:47
see it shrinking?
 

1145
01:05:47 --> 01:05:50
 
 

1146
01:05:50 --> 01:05:52
Yeah, except for
the weird people.

1147
01:05:52 --> 01:05:55
 
 

1148
01:05:55 --> 01:06:03
That's because your visual
system is continuously

1149
01:06:03 --> 01:06:05
re-generating itself.
 

1150
01:06:05 --> 01:06:10
You go stare at the red thing,
you wear out, in a sense, the

1151
01:06:10 --> 01:06:14
red detecting chunk of your
visual system, and then if you

1152
01:06:14 --> 01:06:16
flip your eyes over you
find out that you see a

1153
01:06:16 --> 01:06:17
white thing is green.
 

1154
01:06:17 --> 01:06:19
But then you recover
from it, right?

1155
01:06:19 --> 01:06:21
Good.
 

1156
01:06:21 --> 01:06:22
How many people still
see this effect?

1157
01:06:22 --> 01:06:26
 
 

1158
01:06:26 --> 01:06:29
Tilt your head just to make
sure if you think it's there.

1159
01:06:29 --> 01:06:31
A little weak today.
 

1160
01:06:31 --> 01:06:34
We probably should have
gone a little bit longer.

1161
01:06:34 --> 01:06:36
Those of you who are seeing it,
and perhaps even those of you

1162
01:06:36 --> 01:06:39
who are not -- did I put a
test pattern on the

1163
01:06:39 --> 01:06:41
handout, I forget?
 

1164
01:06:41 --> 01:06:42
No, OK.
 

1165
01:06:42 --> 01:06:45
I'll just bring the
Powerpoint back next week.

1166
01:06:45 --> 01:06:49
Not only are you still seeing
this some minutes afterwards,

1167
01:06:49 --> 01:06:51
but particularly if I don't
show you the test pattern

1168
01:06:51 --> 01:06:57
a lot you may see it
for days and weeks.

1169
01:06:57 --> 01:07:00
The longest report in the
literature for the McCullough

1170
01:07:00 --> 01:07:04
effect is three months.
 

1171
01:07:04 --> 01:07:10
The only reason it's only three
months is because at that point

1172
01:07:10 --> 01:07:13
the undergraduates, who, of
course, were the subjects,

1173
01:07:13 --> 01:07:17
went away on vacation and
the experiment ended.

1174
01:07:17 --> 01:07:21
The evidence suggests that if
we locked you in the dark that

1175
01:07:21 --> 01:07:24
the McCullough effect
would last forever.

1176
01:07:24 --> 01:07:26
We won't lock you in the dark.
 

1177
01:07:26 --> 01:07:30
 
 

1178
01:07:30 --> 01:07:32
I teach this up at Harvard
where there are many more

1179
01:07:32 --> 01:07:35
pre-law students, and the
immediate reaction to this

1180
01:07:35 --> 01:07:38
news is half of them
consider filing suit.

1181
01:07:38 --> 01:07:41
 
 

1182
01:07:41 --> 01:07:43
This will not, in fact, ruin
your life in any fashion.

1183
01:07:43 --> 01:07:47
In fact, it'll only be
noticeable if you happen to end

1184
01:07:47 --> 01:07:49
up looking at a test pattern
like this or perhaps serving

1185
01:07:49 --> 01:07:55
time in the near future.
 

1186
01:07:55 --> 01:07:58
But this was something that
McCullough was not expecting.

1187
01:07:58 --> 01:08:03
McCullough thought that what
she had done here was, OK, you

1188
01:08:03 --> 01:08:06
can fatigue color, you can
fatigue orientation, well I'll

1189
01:08:06 --> 01:08:08
fatigue the cells in the brain
and there are cells in the

1190
01:08:08 --> 01:08:12
brain that are interested
in red vertical lines.

1191
01:08:12 --> 01:08:15
They'll get tired, I'll see
white vertical as green,

1192
01:08:15 --> 01:08:18
they'll recover, I'll see
white vertical as white.

1193
01:08:18 --> 01:08:21
But what happened was you
looked at red vertical lines

1194
01:08:21 --> 01:08:24
for a while, white vertical
looked green and white vertical

1195
01:08:24 --> 01:08:29
looked green for like a really,
really long time thereafter.

1196
01:08:29 --> 01:08:34
What seems to be going on
here is something like this.

1197
01:08:34 --> 01:08:38
 
 

1198
01:08:38 --> 01:09:03
Let's suppose that the way you
decide that something is white

1199
01:09:03 --> 01:09:10
vertical is by looking at the
balance of -- well here,

1200
01:09:10 --> 01:09:11
let's draw it this way.
 

1201
01:09:11 --> 01:09:15
 
 

1202
01:09:15 --> 01:09:19
You've got red vertical input
and you've got green vertical

1203
01:09:19 --> 01:09:28
input, and they're being like
let's put a little dial here.

1204
01:09:28 --> 01:09:31
If they're roughly equal you
decide something looks white.

1205
01:09:31 --> 01:09:34
So I show you red vertical for
a while and this thing gets

1206
01:09:34 --> 01:09:37
weak and cruddy, and now
something that should be

1207
01:09:37 --> 01:09:40
producing equal input gets more
from there and it ends up

1208
01:09:40 --> 01:09:42
looking a little green.
 

1209
01:09:42 --> 01:09:45
Alright, that's fine.
 

1210
01:09:45 --> 01:09:53
What happens if this cell gets
sick -- it's not going to be

1211
01:09:53 --> 01:09:57
one cell, but suppose that this
process gets weak in some

1212
01:09:57 --> 01:10:02
fashion, not because you were
looking at some stimulus, but

1213
01:10:02 --> 01:10:09
because you went out and ate
the mushroom that you shouldn't

1214
01:10:09 --> 01:10:13
have eaten or whatever and
this cell just took a hit.

1215
01:10:13 --> 01:10:16
And so now this is kind
of a cruddy cell.

1216
01:10:16 --> 01:10:19
 
 

1217
01:10:19 --> 01:10:21
Well, there are a couple
of possibilities.

1218
01:10:21 --> 01:10:26
One of them is that for the
rest of time you're going

1219
01:10:26 --> 01:10:31
to end up seeing white
things as looking green.

1220
01:10:31 --> 01:10:33
That's not going
to be good right.

1221
01:10:33 --> 01:10:38
You don't want that happen.
 

1222
01:10:38 --> 01:10:45
So if you decided that this was
the situation, what you would

1223
01:10:45 --> 01:10:50
want to do is change
the gain on here.

1224
01:10:50 --> 01:10:55
So if this was previously just
equal gain, let's crank this up

1225
01:10:55 --> 01:10:59
a little bit so that we can
drag that back up

1226
01:10:59 --> 01:11:03
to being equal.
 

1227
01:11:03 --> 01:11:05
That sounds OK.
 

1228
01:11:05 --> 01:11:06
That seems like a clever
enough thing to do.

1229
01:11:06 --> 01:11:09
But how are you gonna do that?
 

1230
01:11:09 --> 01:11:16
How are you going to figure
out that you're broken.

1231
01:11:16 --> 01:11:20
How would you know that
your visual system was not

1232
01:11:20 --> 01:11:22
reporting the truth to you.
 

1233
01:11:22 --> 01:11:25
Well, I mean one way would be
you're saying hey, that looks

1234
01:11:25 --> 01:11:27
white to me, and somebody else
says that looks green and they

1235
01:11:27 --> 01:11:29
laugh at you or something.
 

1236
01:11:29 --> 01:11:31
Nah, it doesn't work.
 

1237
01:11:31 --> 01:11:33
No evidence that that works.
 

1238
01:11:33 --> 01:11:41
What you do is that you seem to
have some sort of notion of the

1239
01:11:41 --> 01:11:46
statistics of the world, the
way the world ought to be.

1240
01:11:46 --> 01:11:52
If the world is systematically
different from that, you draw

1241
01:11:52 --> 01:11:58
the conclusion that you've got
trouble here of some

1242
01:11:58 --> 01:11:59
variety or other.
 

1243
01:11:59 --> 01:12:02
Well not necessary, you don't
necessarily draw the -- let me

1244
01:12:02 --> 01:12:04
give you a non-troubled
version of this.

1245
01:12:04 --> 01:12:06
How many people have been
to one of these omni

1246
01:12:06 --> 01:12:09
theater kind of movies?
 

1247
01:12:09 --> 01:12:14
The main reason for going to an
omni theater movie is what?

1248
01:12:14 --> 01:12:17
You want to feel like
you're moving, right,

1249
01:12:17 --> 01:12:19
when you're not moving.
 

1250
01:12:19 --> 01:12:21
Because all the movies that
they ever show you at the

1251
01:12:21 --> 01:12:26
science museum are things where
you go driving around in

1252
01:12:26 --> 01:12:31
race cars, stuff like that.
 

1253
01:12:31 --> 01:12:33
Why does this work?
 

1254
01:12:33 --> 01:12:41
You're sitting at this huge
screen, and everything

1255
01:12:41 --> 01:12:45
in your visual field is
moving in the same way.

1256
01:12:45 --> 01:12:47
You know something
about the world.

1257
01:12:47 --> 01:12:52
The world on average
is stationary.

1258
01:12:52 --> 01:12:57
If the whole world is moving
there's a good explanation

1259
01:12:57 --> 01:12:58
for that typically.
 

1260
01:12:58 --> 01:13:02
The answer is not the
world, it's you.

1261
01:13:02 --> 01:13:04
What is it that causes
the whole world to slide

1262
01:13:04 --> 01:13:05
across your retina?
 

1263
01:13:05 --> 01:13:07
This is what causes the
whole world to slide

1264
01:13:07 --> 01:13:09
across the retina.
 

1265
01:13:09 --> 01:13:13
Sit in the omni and the world
is sliding across your retina.

1266
01:13:13 --> 01:13:16
Your brain says uh-huh, the
world isn't moving, I'm moving,

1267
01:13:16 --> 01:13:18
and I think I'll throw
up now for a while or

1268
01:13:18 --> 01:13:19
something like that.
 

1269
01:13:19 --> 01:13:23
That's a separate
interesting question.

1270
01:13:23 --> 01:13:27
What is it here that could tell
you that you're out of whack?

1271
01:13:27 --> 01:13:31
Well, what is the normal
relationship between color and

1272
01:13:31 --> 01:13:32
orientation in the world?
 

1273
01:13:32 --> 01:13:36
 
 

1274
01:13:36 --> 01:13:40
Typically in the world if you
see something that's vertical,

1275
01:13:40 --> 01:13:43
what do you know
about its color?

1276
01:13:43 --> 01:13:45
That's right, nothing.
 

1277
01:13:45 --> 01:13:49
So what's going on here?
 

1278
01:13:49 --> 01:13:50
It's vertical.
 

1279
01:13:50 --> 01:13:51
It's green.
 

1280
01:13:51 --> 01:13:54
If it's horizontal it's red.
 

1281
01:13:54 --> 01:13:56
If it's vertical, it's green.
 

1282
01:13:56 --> 01:13:58
If it's horizontal, it's red.
 

1283
01:13:58 --> 01:14:01
You do this for long enough and
a little chunk of your brain,

1284
01:14:01 --> 01:14:04
rather like the little chunk of
your brain that's saying I ate

1285
01:14:04 --> 01:14:08
the cupcakes, I threw up, I'd
better do something about this.

1286
01:14:08 --> 01:14:11
This little chunk of your
brain is saying, oh, there's

1287
01:14:11 --> 01:14:14
a correlation between
color and orientation.

1288
01:14:14 --> 01:14:21
The only way that happens is if
I'm broken, and the only thing

1289
01:14:21 --> 01:14:25
to do about that is to adjust
the gain on chunks of

1290
01:14:25 --> 01:14:27
my visual system.
 

1291
01:14:27 --> 01:14:33
So, everything looks green.
 

1292
01:14:33 --> 01:14:34
All the vertical
things look green.

1293
01:14:34 --> 01:14:36
Oh my goodness, what
am I going to do?

1294
01:14:36 --> 01:14:40
Well I better crank down the
gain on the green side, it's

1295
01:14:40 --> 01:14:43
obviously too high, and
I'm want to crank up the

1296
01:14:43 --> 01:14:45
gain on the red side.
 

1297
01:14:45 --> 01:14:49
Unfortunately, that was a goof.
 

1298
01:14:49 --> 01:14:52
And it was wrong, so then when
you look at a white thing it

1299
01:14:52 --> 01:14:54
now looks red because you
cranked the gain up

1300
01:14:54 --> 01:14:56
too much over here.
 

1301
01:14:56 --> 01:14:58
How do you recover from this?
 

1302
01:14:58 --> 01:15:03
Well, if I now show you
the opposite one -- what

1303
01:15:03 --> 01:15:04
were we doing before?
 

1304
01:15:04 --> 01:15:05
What was it, green vertical?
 

1305
01:15:05 --> 01:15:08
If I show you red verticals and
green horizontals for a while,

1306
01:15:08 --> 01:15:09
that'll push it back
the other way.

1307
01:15:09 --> 01:15:12
But that doesn't typically
happen in the world.

1308
01:15:12 --> 01:15:15
Simply being exposed to a world
where there's no correlation

1309
01:15:15 --> 01:15:17
will slowly push you back.
 

1310
01:15:17 --> 01:15:23
But the reason the effect lasts
so long is that the evidence

1311
01:15:23 --> 01:15:26
from the real world is kind a
weak compared to this

1312
01:15:26 --> 01:15:30
artificial situation
that I cooked up.

1313
01:15:30 --> 01:15:32
The way I'm thinking about this
is like -- here's another

1314
01:15:32 --> 01:15:33
way of thinking about this.
 

1315
01:15:33 --> 01:15:45
Suppose you're measuring
average weight of people.

1316
01:15:45 --> 01:15:51
I'm just going to keep weighing
people and what's the

1317
01:15:51 --> 01:15:52
average weight of people.
 

1318
01:15:52 --> 01:15:54
It'll bounce around
a little bit.

1319
01:15:54 --> 01:15:55
Alright.
 

1320
01:15:55 --> 01:15:58
This is how much people
on average weigh.

1321
01:15:58 --> 01:16:02
Now what happens is the
amazing 1,000 pound guy

1322
01:16:02 --> 01:16:04
comes into my experiment.
 

1323
01:16:04 --> 01:16:06
What happens to the average?
 

1324
01:16:06 --> 01:16:09
 
 

1325
01:16:09 --> 01:16:12
Now I start weighing
normal people again.

1326
01:16:12 --> 01:16:16
Does it just go -- no.
 

1327
01:16:16 --> 01:16:19
Weighing regular people it'll
take a comparatively long time

1328
01:16:19 --> 01:16:21
for me to get back to normal.
 

1329
01:16:21 --> 01:16:23
So that's what's going on here.
 

1330
01:16:23 --> 01:16:26
The McCullough effect adapting
stimulus is the 1,000 pound guy

1331
01:16:26 --> 01:16:29
that's causing you to think
that your brain is broken.

1332
01:16:29 --> 01:16:34
You go and re-adjust your
brain and now slowly

1333
01:16:34 --> 01:16:37
it will get better.
 

1334
01:16:37 --> 01:16:40
How's it look there?
 

1335
01:16:40 --> 01:16:41
Not better yet.
 

1336
01:16:41 --> 01:16:43
How many people have
a nice after effect?

1337
01:16:43 --> 01:16:46
Still, nice McCullough effect?
 

1338
01:16:46 --> 01:16:50
Celeste McCullough
would be so proud.

1339
01:16:50 --> 01:16:53
You will notice that I have
not said a word about

1340
01:16:53 --> 01:16:55
signal detection theory.
 

1341
01:16:55 --> 01:16:58
I noticed that, too.
 

1342
01:16:58 --> 01:16:59
There is a chunk in
[? Gleichman ?]

1343
01:16:59 --> 01:16:59
about it.
 

1344
01:16:59 --> 01:17:02
I might decide to talk
about it on Thursday.

1345
01:17:02 --> 01:17:05
Oh, you may also notice that
you have lost your cell phone.

1346
01:17:05 --> 01:17:07
If that is true come and
talk to me about it

1347
01:17:07 --> 01:17:09
because we found it.
 

1348
01:17:09 --> 01:17:11
One last thing.
 

1349
01:17:11 --> 01:17:13
How many people
know what that is?

1350
01:17:13 --> 01:17:16
 
 

1351
01:17:16 --> 01:17:18
I didn't ask you what it was,
I just wanted to know if

1352
01:17:18 --> 01:17:19
you knew what it was.
 

1353
01:17:19 --> 01:17:23
How many people recognize this?
 

1354
01:17:23 --> 01:17:24
Only a few.
 

1355
01:17:24 --> 01:17:26
OK, now you can shout out.
 

1356
01:17:26 --> 01:17:27
AUDIENCE: It's a dog.
 

1357
01:17:27 --> 01:17:28
PROFESSOR: It's a dog.
 

1358
01:17:28 --> 01:17:29
How many people does that help?
 

1359
01:17:29 --> 01:17:35
 
 

1360
01:17:35 --> 01:17:38
It's head is -- well,
wait a second.

1361
01:17:38 --> 01:17:44
There's its head, foot, back
paw, it's back, it's sort

1362
01:17:44 --> 01:17:47
of sniffing at a ground
plane that's like here.

1363
01:17:47 --> 01:17:55
 
 

1364
01:17:55 --> 01:17:58
You can store that one
away till next week and

1365
01:17:58 --> 01:18:00
we'll talk about it.
 

1366
01:18:00 --> 01:18:01
