***** Course Description *****
This course surveys questions about human behavior and mental life ranging from
how you see to why you fall in love. The great controversies: nature and
nurture, free will, consciousness, human differences, self and society.
Students are exposed to the range of theoretical perspectives including
biological, evolutionary, cognitive, and psychoanalytic. One of the best
aspects of Psychology is that you are the subject matter. This makes it
possible to do many demonstrations in lecture that allow you to experience the
topic under study. Lectures work in tandem with the textbook. The course breaks
into small recitations sections to allow discussion, oral presentations, and
individual contact with instructors.
***** OCW Scholar Version *****
OCW Scholar courses are designed for self-paced study with no registration
required. They are substantially more complete than typical OCW courses,
blending new online content with material used in MIT classes.
