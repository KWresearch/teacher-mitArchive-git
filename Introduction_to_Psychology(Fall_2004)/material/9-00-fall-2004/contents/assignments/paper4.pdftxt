Paper Four: Revision
DUE TO YOUR TA BY 9AM ON FRI, DEC 3 

If you write a newspaper story, a grant proposal, or a piece of prose for a textbook, it is very 
likely that the first draft will not be the last. Your deathless prose will go to an editor/reviewer 
who will declare that the work is not acceptable until you do X, Y, and Z. You can moan about 
the stupidity of your reader. However, if you want the money, the fame, or whatever, you will 
need to make that specific person happy. It is a very useful skill. 

This paper will be somewhat longer than the others because there will be some new material. 
However, it is OK if substantial chunks come from the original paper (as long as you fix those 
typos, etc) 

Step 1: What does your TA want? 

Your TA will hand back your papers marked up with various comments  and there may be a section 
containing clear instructions for revision. Those instructions would include 
1)  One specific question about content, asking for more information. 
2)  Some  general  comments  about  stylistic  changes  (e.g.  is  the  organization  clear? How 
is the grammar, etc?) 

If you want to revise a paper that does not have these instructions for whatever reason, you need to 
get instruction from your TA before you revise. 

At least ten days in advance of the due date for the paper, you must give your TA a sentence or two 
describing your plans for revision. Your TA must agree with the general plan. 

Step 2: Add new material 

The revised paper must make use of at least two scholarly sources beyond what you used in the 
original paper. You may already have some extra sources in hand or you may need to go back to the 
real or virtual library. 

Step 3: Write the revised paper 

Here are the requirements for this paper:
1.  Length is probably about 8 pages.
2.  In the revised paper, be sure to correct the problems that your TA identified. 

3.	 You must answer the question posed by your TA (If that looks to be impossible, talk to your 
TA and maybe the question could change.)
4.	 You  must  also  expand  the  paper  to  include  material  from  two  primary  sources  beyond  the 
source  of  the  original  article.  This  new material might  answer  your  TA’s  question  it might 
bolster your existing points. 

NOTE: If you want help with the revision of this paper you can talk to your TA and/or to the 
Writing  Center. To request an appointment with one of the tutors, send an email at  least 
48 hours  in advance of your desired meeting-time. If your TA seems significantly unhappy 
with the writing of the first version of the paper it would be A Really Good Idea to seek 
some help. That  is  the purpose of an assignment that  can  be  revised.  IN  FACT….You 
can  ask  the  writing  tutors  for  help  with  any  of  your papers. That might be A Good Idea. 

Step 4: Write the “cover letter” 

As  noted  above,  to  get  your  paper  published  or  your  grant  funded,  you  must  satisfy  the 
reader/editor/reviewer.  So,  you  revise  the work AND,  typically,  you write  a  letter  explaining  your 
revisions. The  last part of  this assignment  is  to write  that  letter. Describe what you have changed  in 
the  revised  paper. Briefly  explain  how  you  have  answered  the  questions  raised  by  your TA.  If  you 
disagreed  with  a  suggestion,  you  can  say  that  too  (with  an  intelligent  explanation)  but  remember, 
here and in your later life, that your job, in this case, is to make the reviewer/editor/TA happy. 

Your cover letter should be about a page long (unless you made lots of changes.) It does not need 
to be in a very formal style. It just needs to guide the reader and persuade the reader that you 
were listening to the prior round of comments.
