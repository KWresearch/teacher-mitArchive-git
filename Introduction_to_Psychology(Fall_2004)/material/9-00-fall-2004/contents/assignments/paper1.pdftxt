Paper One: Writing for the public
DUE TO YOUR TA BY 9AM ON FRI, SEPT 24 
Topics: Note: You can write about a topic before you have heard the lecture on the topic 
The Paper One topic must be drawn from the materials relating to Lectures 1-6 / Chapters 1-6 

For this paper, you need to imagine that you are writing a science news or feature article for 
publication in the science section of the newspaper. If you want to see a model, find the New York 
Times or the Boston Globe on any Tuesday and look at the science section. 

NOTE: The one BIG difference between your paper and a real article in the newspaper is that 
newspaper articles do not use bibliographic citation. You do, please. 

Step 1: Convince your "editor" 

If you were going to write an article for the newspaper, you would need to convince your editor that 
this was an article that he/she might want to publish. In this case, your TA is your editor. At least ten 
days in advance of the due date for the paper, you must give your TA a topic (just a sentence or two) 
and at least one source beyond what we give you on the server. You can probably email this but 
that is up to your TA. 

Step 2: Fill in the background 

You may not know much about your topic (reporters often do not). Reading broadly will help. You 
can fish around on the web. You might do better to go to the library and look in some general 
sources like textbooks, handbooks, etc. As ever, the librarians can help. Again, this is a good reason 
to sign up for a library workshop. 

Step 3: Write an interesting and readable six-page paper. 

The paper needs to have the following components (organization is up to you). 

a.�A good "lead": You need to draw your readers into the article. Why should they read about this 
topic? There are lots of other articles in the paper. 

b.�Background: There is no guarantee that your readers (well, your TA) will know anything about 
this topic. Be sure to educate the reader. 

c.�News: What is the news here? What specific nugget of information makes this worth space in the 
paper? NOTE: That might come from some article other than the article that got you started. You 
might  have  gotten  into  the  topic  from whatever  is  on  the website  but  your  research might  have 
uncovered The Really Interesting Stuff elsewhere. 

d.�Bibliography: The listing of the works that you used.
