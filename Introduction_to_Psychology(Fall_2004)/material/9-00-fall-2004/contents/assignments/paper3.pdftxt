Paper Three: Rewriting the textbook
DUE TO YOUR TA BY 9AM ON FRI, NOV 5 
Paper Three must be drawn from the materials relating to Lectures 17-24 / Chapters 13, 15-17 

For this paper, you goal is to draft a new piece for the Gleitman et al. textbook. The centerpiece 
of this paper will be a piece of textbook prose. Aim for a piece that would be like one of the 
sections with a reddish-brown title in the text. If that makes no sense, open to page 384 (to pick a 
random page). You want to write something that could be like the "Attribution as a rational 
process" section or the "Errors in the attribution process" section. Note that these are very 
different in length. Notice that different topics require different lengths of text. Pick a topic that 
will give you 6 manuscript (not 6 textbook) pages of material. 

Your paper should have the following parts. 

a.	 Rationale: Why is this topic something that really should be in an introductory text? 
NOTE: In coming up with an answer to this question, you may find that you need to 
broaden your topic. A cool experiment, no matter how cool, is likely to get a line or two 
in a textbook. The articles posted in the folders on the server are, for the most 
part, pretty specific. You will need to read enough to generate a textbook section â€“ not a 
textbook sentence. This section is NOT what you would put in the textbook. It is your 
short justification for the inclusion of this topic. It might be a cover letter to the editor. 

b.	 The textbook bit: In writing this, pay attention to textbook style. If you introduce an 
important new term, you should put it in boldface and, more importantly, you should be 
sure to define it in the text. Think about level of detail. There are not a lot of 
methodological details in the typical bit of textbook prose. Don't forget to cite your 
sources in the text. Look at the rate of citation in Gleitman. Can't have a citation on every 
line but you can have quite a few in a section. 

c.	 Placement: Tell us where this would go in Gleitman. Now, if your TA were a real 
textbook editor, he/she would tell you that you can't make your book any fatter or the 
students will scream. So a clever version of this section will describe what will be 
removed to make room for your brilliant piece of prose. 
d.	 Summary: Look at page 411 of Gleitman. Summary point #9 covers the two sections 
mentioned above from page 384. You should write the very brief summary that would go 
at the end of the chapter. What critical bits do the students have to get into their heads in 
order to pass the exam? 

e.	 Bibliography: As ever, the listing of the works that you used.
