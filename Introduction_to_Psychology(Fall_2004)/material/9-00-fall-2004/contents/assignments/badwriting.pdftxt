Examples of Bad Writing 

Within our society, it has been shown that there is an individual. An individual with individual thoughts 
and actions. But who determines whether or not he is correct in their choices? Are our thoughts brain 
washed through the media with it’s hellish ideas or our closet friends that try to direct us in the right 
direction? No one may ever know what is right or wrong.  So what is ethical relativism anyway? And 
who is behind all of the madness of ethical relativism? It has been said that relativist’s are believed to 
think that relativism is true.  Ethical Relativism is of a mind to say that whatever one’s culture says is 
right is the right thing for him or her to do. One might conclude that the world we human beings live in 
is not without a variety of many different and diverse cultures with different cultural practices and 
hence different moralities. Studying ethics from a philosophical point of view, ethical relativist’s might 
conclude that your wasting your time just like philosophers have always wasted they’re time. 
This change will allow us to better leverage our talent base in an area where developmental roles are 
under way and strategically focuses us toward the upcoming Business System transition where 
Systems literacy and accuracy will be essential to maintain and to further improve service levels to 
our customer base going forward. 
If the theories of science were the laws of origin how is it said that people have such strong emotions 
from a science experiment? Freud speaks of a child that is lost, but love created this child and God 
gave him a soul to love back. He thought religion fulfilled the gap for new adults who had no parents 
but there seems to be a lot of children with parents that give them love, security, and their needs and 
they still believe highly in God and the scriptures. This proves that religion does not fill the gap of a 
parent which has been lost.

In June immense schools of small, silvery fish called capelin enter the hundreds of bays that dot the 
eastern coast of Newfoundland to perform a fascinating ceremony. The males and females 
separately approach the gravel beaches and are borne ashore in waves so laden with their bodies as 
to be virtual walls of fish. There, on the gravel, the females lay their eggs and the males fertilize them; 
then most of the fish die.  - “The Spawning of the Capelin,” Scientific American 

“Colors,” said Leigh Hunt, a 19th-century poet, "are the smiles of Nature." Just how does an observer 
distinguish one smile from another? To a great extent the answer lies in the three classes of cone-
shaped, color-sensing cells in the retina of the eye. Each class responds differently to light reflected 
from a colored object, depending on whether the cells have within them red, green, or blue 
pigments.”  - “The Genes for Color Vision,” Scientific American 
Can a machine think? Can a machine have conscious thoughts in exactly the same sense that you 
and I have? If by "machine" one means a physical system capable of performing certain functions 
(and what else can one mean?), then humans are machines of a special biological kind, and humans 
can think, and so of course machines can think. And, for all we know, it might be possible to produce 
a thinking machine out of different materials altogether--say, out of silicon chips or vacuum tubes. In 
recent decades, however, the question of whether a machine can think has been given a different 
interpretation entirely. The question that has been posed in its place is, Could a machine think just by
virtue of implementing a computer program?  - “Is the Brain's Mind a Computer Program?”  Scientific 
American
