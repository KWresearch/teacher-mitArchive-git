Problem Set 5 
Due: March 12 

Reading: Ch. 9.1.4, Derived Variables; Ch. 9.2, Stable Marriage; Ch. 10.1, Graph Isomorphism 

Problem 1. 
The following procedure can be applied to any digraph, G: 

1.  Delete an edge that is traversed by a directed cycle. 
→ 

v  if there is a directed path from vertex u to vertex v  that does not traverse 

2.  Delete edge u
v .→ 
u
3.  Add edge u
v . 

→ 

v  if there is no directed path in either direction between vertex u and vertex 

Repeat these operations until none of them are applicable. 
This  procedure  can  be  modeled  as  a  state  machine.  The  start  state  is  G,  and  the  states  are  all 
possible digraphs with the same vertices as G. 
(a)	 Let G be the graph with vertices {1, 2, 3, 4} and edges 
{1
→ → → → → 
2, 1
4, 3
3, 3
2, 2

4}

What are the possible ﬁnal states reachable from G? 

A  line  graph  is  a  graph whose  edges  can  all  be  traversed  by  a directed  simple path.  All  the ﬁnal 
graphs in part (a) are line graphs. 

(b)  Prove that if the procedure terminates with a digraph, H , then H  is a line graph with the same 
vertices as G.

Hint:  Show that if H  is not a line graph, then some operation must be applicable.


(c)  Prove that being a DAG is a preserved invariant of the procedure. 

(d)  Prove that if G is a DAG and the procedure terminates, then the path relation of the ﬁnal line 
graph is a topological sort of G. 
Hint: Verify that the predicate 

P (u, v) ::= there is a directed path from u to v 

is a preserved invariant of the procedure, for any two vertices u, v of a DAG.

Problem Set 5 

(e)  Prove that if G is ﬁnite, then the procedure terminates. 
Hint: Let s be the number of simple cycles, e be the number of edges, and p be the number of pairs 
of vertices with a directed path (in either direction) between them. Note that p ≤ n2  where n is the 
number of vertices of G.  Find coefﬁcients a, b, c such  that as + bp + e + c  is a strictly decreasing, 
N-valued variable. 

Problem 2. 
Give an example of a stable matching between 3 boys and 3 girls where no person gets their ﬁrst 
choice. Brieﬂy explain why your matching is stable. 

Problem 3. 
In a stable matching between n boys and girls produced by the Mating Ritual, call a person lucky 
if they are matched up with one of their �n/2� top choices. We will prove: 
Theorem.  There must be at least one lucky person. 

To prove this, deﬁne the following derived variables for the Mating Ritual: 

q(B ) =  j , where  j  is  the  rank  of  the  girl  that  boy B  is  courting.  That  is  to  say,  boy B  is  always 
courting the j th girl on his list. 

(a)	 Let 

r(G) is the number of boys that girl G has rejected. 
�
� 
q(B ) − 
S  ::= 
r(G). 
B∈Boys 
G∈Girls 
Show that S  remains the same from one day to the next in the Mating Ritual. 

(b)  Prove the Theorem above.  (You may assume for simplicity that n is even.) 
Hint: A girl is sure to be lucky if she has rejected half the boys.

Problem 4. 
Determine which  among  the  four graphs pictured  in  the Figures are  isomorphic.  If  two of  these 
graphs  are  isomorphic,  describe  an  isomorphism between  them.  If  they  are not,  give  a property 
that is preserved under isomorphism such that one graph has the property, but the other does not. 
For at least one of the properties you choose, prove that it is indeed preserved under isomorphism 
(you only need prove one of them).
