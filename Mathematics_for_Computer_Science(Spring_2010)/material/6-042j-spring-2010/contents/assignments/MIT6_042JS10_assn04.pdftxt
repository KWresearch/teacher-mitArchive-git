Problem Set 4 
Due: March 5 

Reading: Chapter 7, Partial Orders, §§4–6; Ch. 8, Digraphs; Ch. 9, State Machines, §9.1–§9.1.3 

Problem 1. 
Let � be a partial order on a set, A, and let 
Ak  ::= {a  | depth (a) = k} 

where k ∈ N. 
(a)  Prove that A0 , A1 , . . .  is a parallel schedule for � according to Deﬁnition 7.5.5. 
(b)  Prove that Ak  is an antichain. 

Problem 2. 
In a  round-robin  tournament,  every pair of distinct players play against each other  just once.  For 
a round-robin tournament with with no tied games, a record of who beat whom can be described 
y  if x→
with a tournament digraph, where the vertices correspond to players and there is an edge x
beat y  in their game.

A ranking is a directed simple path that includes all the players.


(a)  Give an example of a tournament digraph with more than one ranking. 

(b)  If a tournament digraph is a DAG, then it has a unique ranking. Explain. 

(c)  Prove that every tournament digraph has a ranking.  Hint:  Induction on the size of the tour­
nament. 

Problem 3. 
A  robot  named  Wall-E  wanders  around  a  two-dimensional  grid.  He  starts  out  at  (0, 0)  and  is 
allowed to take four different types of step: 

1.  (+2, −1) 
2.  (+1, −2) 
3.  (+1, +1)

Problem Set 4 

Thus,  for  example,  Wall-E  might  walk  as  follows.  The  types  of  his  steps  are  listed  above  the 
arrows. 

(0, 0)  1  (2, −1)  3  (3, 0)  2  (4, −2)  4  (1, −2) → . . .

Wall-E’s true love, the fashionable and high-powered robot, Eve, awaits at (0, 2). 

(a)  Describe a state machine model of this problem. 

(b)  Will Wall-E ever ﬁnd his true love? Either ﬁnd a path from Wall-E to Eve or use the Invariant 
Principle to prove that no such path exists. 

Problem 4. 
In  the  late  1960s,  the military  junta  that  ousted  the  government  of  the  small  republic  of  Nerdia

completely outlawed built-in multiplication operations, and also forbade division by any number

other than 3. Fortunately, a young dissident found a way to help the population multiply any two

nonnegative integers without risking persecution by the junta. The procedure he taught people is:


procedure multiply(x, y :  nonnegative integers)

r  := x;

s  := y ;

a := 0;

while s = 0 do

|
if 3  s then

r  := r + r + r ;

s  := s/3;

else if 3 | (s − 1) then

a := a + r ;

r  := r + r + r ;

s  := (s − 1)/3;

else 
a := a + r + r ;

r  := r + r + r ;

s  := (s − 2)/3;

return a; 

We  can model  the  algorithm  as  a  state machine whose  states  are  triples  of  nonnegative  integers 
⎧ ⎪⎨ ⎪⎩

(r, s, a). The initial state is (x, y , 0). The transitions are given by the rule that for s > 0: 
if 3 | s 
(3r, s/3, a) 
if 3 | (s − 1) 
(3r, (s − 1)/3, a + r) 
(3r, (s − 2)/3, a + 2r)  otherwise. 

(r, s, a) →

(a)  List the sequence of steps that appears in the execution of the algorithm for inputs x = 5 and 
y = 10. 

(b)  Use  the  Invariant Method  to  prove  that  the  algorithm  is  partially  correct —that  is,  if  s  = 0, 
then a = xy . 

(c)  Prove that the algorithm terminates after at most 1 + log3 y  executions of the body of the do 
statement.
