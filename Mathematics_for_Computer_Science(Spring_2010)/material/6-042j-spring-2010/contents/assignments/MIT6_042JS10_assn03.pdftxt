Problem Set 3 
Due:  February 26 

Reading: Chapter 6, Induction; Chapter 7, Partial Orders, §§1–3. 

Problem 1.

empty and B has more than one element, then NO T(A surj [A
Hint:  Suppose there is a function, σ , that maps each element a ∈ A to a function σa  : A → B .  Pick

any two elements of B ; call them 0 and 1. Then deﬁne 
0 if σa (a) = 1,
diag(a) ::= 
1 otherwise. 

Problem 2. 
Fibonacci numbers are deﬁned as follows: 

F (0) ::= 0, 
F (1) ::= 1, 
F (n) ::= F (n − 1) + F (n − 2) 

(for n ≥ 2). 

(1) 

Thus, the ﬁrst few Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and 21.  Prove by induction that for 
all n ≥ 1, 
F (n − 1)  F (n + 1) − F (n)2  = (−1)n .

Problem 3. 
For  any binary  string,  α,  let num (α) be  the nonnegative  integer  it  represents  in binary notation. 
For example, num (10) = 2, and num (0101) = 5. 
An n + 1-bit adder adds two n + 1-bit binary numbers. More precisely, an n + 1-bit adder takes two 
length n + 1 binary strings 

αn  ::= an  . . . a1a0 , 
βn  ::= bn  . . . b1 b0 , 

and a binary digit, c0 , as inputs, and produces a length n + 1 binary string

and a binary digit, cn+1 , as outputs, and satisﬁes the speciﬁcation: 

num (αn ) + num (βn ) + c0  = 2n+1 cn+1  + num (σn ) . 

(3) 

There  is  a  straighforward way  to  implement  an  n + 1-bit  adder  as  a  digital  circuit:  an  n + 1-bit 
ripple-carry circuit has 1 + 2(n + 1) binary inputs 

an , . . . , a1 , a0 , bn , . . . , b1 , b0 , c0 , 

and n + 2 binary outputs, 

cn+1 , sn , . . . , s1 , s0 . 
As in Problem 3.5, the ripple-carry circuit is speciﬁed by the following formulas: 

si  ::= ai  XOR  bi  XOR  ci 
ci+1  ::= (ai  AND  bi ) OR  (ai  AND  ci ) OR  (bi  AND  ci ), . 

for 0 ≤ i ≤ n. 
(a)  Verify that deﬁnitions (4) and (5) imply that 

an  + bn  + cn  = 2cn+1  + sn . 

(4) 
(5) 

(6) 

for all n ∈ N. 
(b)  Prove by induction on n that an n + 1-bit ripple-carry circuit really is an n + 1-bit adder, that 
is, its outputs satisfy (3).

Hint: You may assume that, by deﬁnition of binary representation of integers,


num (αn+1 ) = an+12n+1  + num (αn ) . 

(7) 

Problem 4. 
Let R and S  be transitive relations on a set, A.  For each of the relations below, either prove that it 
is transitive, or give a counter-example showing that it may not be transitive. 

•  R−1

•
 R ∩ S 
•  R ∪ S 
•  R S◦
