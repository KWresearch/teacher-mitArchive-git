Problem Set 1 
Due:  February 12 

Reading: Chapters 1, What is a Proof?; 2, The Well Ordering Principle; 3, Propositional Formulas. 
These assigned  readings do not  include  the Problem  sections.  (Many of  the problems  in  the  text 
will appear as class or homework problems.) 
Reminder:  Comments on  the  reading using  the NB  online  annotation  system  are due  at  times  indi­
cated in the online tutor problem set TP.2. Reading Comments count for 5% of the ﬁnal grade. 

Problem 1. 
A  recent  class  problem  proved  that  there were  irrational  numbers  a, b  such  that  ab  was  rational. 
√
Unfortunately,  that proof was nonconstructive:  it didn’t  reveal a  speciﬁc pair,  a, b, with  this prop­
2 and b ::= 2 log2 3. 
erty. But in fact, it’s easy to do this:  let a ::= 
√
2  is  irrational,  and  obviously  a = 3.  Finish  the  proof  that  this  a, b  pair  works,  by 
b
We  know 
showing that 2 log2 3 is irrational. 

Problem 2. 
For  n  =  40,  the  value  of  polynomial  p(n)  ::=  n2  +  n +  41  is  not  prime,  as  noted  in  Chapter  1 
of the Course Text.  But we could have predicted based on general principles that no nonconstant 
polynomial, q(n), with integer coefﬁcients can map each nonnegative integer into a prime number. 
Prove it. 
Hint: Let c ::= q(0) be the constant term of q . Consider two cases:  c is not prime, and c is prime.  In 
the second case, note that q(cn)  is a multiple of c for all n  ∈  Z.  You may assume the familiar fact 
that the magnitude (absolute value) of any nonconstant polynomial, q(n), grows unboundedly as 
n grows. 

Problem 3. 
Describe  a  simple  recursive  procedure  which,  given  a  positive  integer  argument,  n,  produces  a 
truth  table whose  rows  are  all  the  assignments  of  truth  values  to  n  propositional  variables.  For 
example, for n = 2, the table might look like:

Problem Set 1 

Your description  can be  in English,  or  a  simple program  in  some  familiar  language  (say Scheme 
or Java), but if you do write a program, be sure to include some sample output. 

Problem 4. 
Prove that the propositional formulas 

P  OR Q OR R 

and 

(P  AND  NOT Q) OR  (Q AND  NO T R) OR  (R AND  NOT P ) OR  (P  AND Q AND R). 

are equivalent. 

Problem 5. 
Use the Well Ordering Principle to prove that 
n ≤ 3n/3 

for every nonnegative integer, n.

Hint: Verify (1) for n ≤ 4 by explicit calculation.
