Problem Set 10 
Due: April 23 

Reading:  Notes Ch. 16.10–16.12 

Problem 1. 
Let’s develop a proof of the Inclusion-Exclusion formula using high school algebra. 

(a)  Most high school students will get freaked by the following formula, even though they actu­
ally know the rule it expresses. How would you explain it to them?

(−1)|I | 
xj .

I⊆{1,...,n} 
i=1 
� 
For any set, S , let MS  be the membership function of S : 
if x ∈ S , 
1 
if x /∈ S . 
0 

Hint:  Show them an example. 

MS (x) = 

(1) 

Let S1 , . . . , Sn  be a sequence of ﬁnite sets, and abbreviate MSi  as Mi .  Let the domain of discourse, 
n
 
D , be the union of the Si ’s. That is, we let 
D ::= 
Si , 
i=1 
and take complements with respect to D , that is, 
T  ::= D − T , 

for T  ⊆ D . 
(b)  Verify that for T  ⊆ D and I  ⊆ {1, . . . n}, 
� 
MT  = 1 − MT , 
M(T 
i∈I  � 
Si ) =  MSi , 
i∈I 
M(S 
Si ) = 1 − 
(1 − Mi ). 
i∈I 
i∈I 
(Note that (3) holds when I  is empty because, by convention, an empty product equals 1, and an 
empty intersection equals the domain of discourse, D .)

Problem 2. 
Give combinatorial proofs of the identities below. Use the following structure for each proof. First, 
deﬁne  an  appropriate  set  S .  Next,  show  that  the  left  side  of  the  equation  counts  the  number  of 
elements in S . Then show that, from another perspective, the right side of the equation also counts 
the number of elements in set S .  Conclude that the left side must be equal to the right, since both 
are equal to |S |.

Hint:  consider  a  set  of  binary  strings  that  could be  counted using  the  right  side  of  the  equation, 
then try partitioning them into subsets countable by the elements of the sum on the left. 

Problem 3.

According to the Multinomial Theorem 16.11.3, (x1  + x2  + ... + xk )n  can be expressed as a sum of 
terms of the form

n 
rk
r1  r2 
x1  x2  ...xk  . 
r1 , r2 , ..., rk 
(a)  How many terms are there in the sum?

(9) 

Give a combinatorial proof of this identity.

Hint: How many terms are there when (x1 + x2 + ... + xk )n  is expressed as a sum of monomials in

xi  before terms with like powers of these variables are collected together under a single coefﬁcient?
