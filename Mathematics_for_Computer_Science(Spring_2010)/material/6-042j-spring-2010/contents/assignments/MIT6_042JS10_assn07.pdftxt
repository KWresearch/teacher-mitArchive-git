Problem Set 7 
Due: April 2 

Reading:  Notes Ch. 12; Ch. 14 

Problem 1. 
A simple graph is sevenish when it has no simple cycles of length less than seven. A map is a planar 
graph whose faces are all simple cycles (no dongles or bridges).  Let M  be a sevenish, connected, 
map with v > 2 vertices, e edges and f  faces. 

(a)	 Prove that 

e ≤ (7v − 14)/5. 
Hint:  Similar to the proof of Corollary 12.6.3, that e ≤ 3v − 6 in planar graphs. 
(b)  Show that M  has a vertex of degree at most two. 

(1) 

(c)  Part  (b)  can  be  used  to  prove  that M  is  3-colorable  by  induction  on  v .  The  proof  is  slightly 
complicated by  the  fact  that subgraphs of M  may not be sevenish,  connected, maps.  For each of 
the following properties, brieﬂy explain why all connected subgraphs of M  have the property, or 
give an example of a connected subgraph of an M  that does not have the property. 

1.  map 
2.  planar 
3.  sevenish 
4.  connected 
5.  3-colorable 

Problem 2. 
Prove  that  the  greatest  common  divisor  of  three  integers  a,  b,  and  c  is  equal  to  their  smallest 
positive  linear  combination;  that  is,  the  smallest positive value of  sa + tb + uc, where  s,  t,  and u 
are integers. 

Problem 3. 
Two  nonparallel  lines  in  the  real  plane  intersect  at  a  point.  Algebraically,  this  means  that  the 
equations 

y = m1x + b1 
y = m2x + b2

have a unique solution (x, y), provided m1  =� m2 .  This statement would be false if we restricted x 
and y  to the integers, since the two lines could cross at a noninteger point: 

However,  an  analogous  statement  holds  if  we  work  over  the  integers  modulo  a  prime,  p.  Find  a 
solution to the congruences 

y ≡ m1x + b1 
(mod  p) 
y ≡ m2x + b2 
(mod  p) 
when  m1  �≡  m2  (mod  p).  Express  your  solution  in  the  form  x  ≡?  (mod  p)  and  y  ≡?  (mod  p) 
where the ?’s denote expressions involving m1 , m2 , b1 , and b2 . You may ﬁnd it helpful to solve the 
original equations over the reals ﬁrst. 

Problem 4. 
Let Sk  = 1k + 2k + . . . + (p − 1)k , where p is an odd prime and k is a positive multiple of p − 1. Use 
Fermat’s theorem to prove that Sk  ≡ −1  (mod  p).
