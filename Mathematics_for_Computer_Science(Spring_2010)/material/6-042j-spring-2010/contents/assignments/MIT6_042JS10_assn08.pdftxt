Problem Set 8 

Due: April 9 

Reading:  Notes Ch. 14; Ch. 15 

Problem 1. 
Suppose  m, n  are  relatively  prime.  In  the  problem  you  will  prove  the  key  property  of  Euler ’s 
function that φ(mn) = φ(m)φ(n). 

(a)  Prove that for any a, b, there is an x such that 
x ≡ a  (mod m), 
x ≡ b  (mod  n). 

Hint: Congruence (1) holds iff 

x = jm + a. 

for some j .  So there is such an x only if 
jm + a ≡ b  (mod  n). 

(1) 
(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

Solve (4) for j . 
(b)  Prove that there is an x satisfying the congruences (1) and (2) such that 0 ≤ x < mn. 
(c)  Prove that the x satisfying part (b) is unique. 
(d)  For  an  integer  k ,  let  k∗  be  the  integers  between  1  and  k  −  1  that  are  relatively  prime  to  k . 
Conclude from part (c) that the function 
f  : (mn)∗  → m∗  × n∗ 

deﬁned by 

is a bijection. 

f (x) ::= (rem(x, m), rem(x, n)) 

(e)  Conclude from the preceding parts of this problem that 

φ(mn) = φ(m)φ(n).

Problem 2 (4). 

Use  integration  to ﬁnd upper and  lower bounds  that differ by at most 0.1 for  the  following sum.

(You may need to add the ﬁrst few terms explicitly and then use integrals to bound the sum of the

� 
remaining terms.)

Problem 3. 
Indicate  which  of  the  following  holds  for  each  pair  of  functions  (f (n), g(n))  in  the  table  below. 
Assume k  ≥  1,  � >  0,  and  c >  1 are  constants.  Pick  the  four  table entries you  consider  to be  the 
most challenging or interesting and justify your answers to these. 

f  = O(g)  f  = o(g)  g = O(f )  g = o(f )  f  = Θ(g)  f  ∼ g
