Problem Set 11 
Due: April 30 

Reading: Redeﬁne the \reading command to get this week’s reading assignment here! 

Problem 1. 
Let x0  ::= 0, x1  ::= 1 and for n ≥ 2, let xn  be deﬁned by the linear recurrence: 

xn  = 3xn−1  − 2xn−2  + n. 
Find a closed form expression for xn . 

Problem 2.

[The Four-Door Deal]

Let’s see what happens when Let’s Make a Deal is played with four doors. A prize is hidden behind 
one of  the  four doors.  Then  the  contestant picks  a door.  Next,  the host opens  an unpicked door 
that has no prize behind it. The contestant is allowed to stick with their original door or to switch 
to one of the two unopened, unpicked doors.  The contestant wins if their ﬁnal choice is the door 
hiding the prize. 
Use  The  Four  Step Method  of  Section  18.1  to  ﬁnd  the  following  probabilities.  The  tree  diagram 
may become awkwardly large, in which case just draw enough of it to make its structure clear. 

(a)  Contestant Stu, a sanitation engineer from Trenton, New Jersey, stays with his original door. 
What is the probability that Stu wins the prize? 

(b)  Contestant Zelda, an alien abduction researcher from Helena, Montana, switches to one of the 
remaining two doors with equal probability. What is the probability that Zelda wins the prize? 

Problem 3. 
Suppose  Pr {}  :  S →  [0, 1]  is  a  probability  function  on  a  sample  space,  S ,  and  let B  be  an  event 
� 
such that Pr {B } > 0. Deﬁne a function PrB  {·} on events outcomes w ∈ S  by the rule: 
if w ∈ B , 
Pr {w} / Pr {B } 
PrB  {w} ::= 
if w /∈ B .	
0 
(a)	 Prove that PrB  {·} is also a probability function on S  according to Deﬁnition 18.2.2.

(b)  Prove that 

for all A ⊆ S . 

PrB  {A} = 

Pr {A ∩ B }
Pr {B }

Problem 4. 
Taking derivatives of generating functions is another useful operation. This is done termwise, that 
is, if 
F (x) = f0  + f1x + f2x 2  + f3x 3  + · · ·  , 

then 

so 

H (x) ::= 

1
(1 − x)2 

= 

For example, 

F � (x) ::= f1  + 2f2x + 3f3x 2  + · · ·  .

1 
(1 − x) 
x 
(1 − x)2 
is the generating function for the sequence of nonegative integers. Therefore 
1 + x 
(1 − x)3  = H � (x) = 1 + 22 x + 32 x 2  + 42 x 3  + · · ·  , 

= 0 + 1x + 2x 2  + 3x 3  +

= 1 + 2x + 3x 2  +

· · · 

· · · 

so 

x2  + x 
(1 − x)3  = xH � (x) = 0 + 1x + 22 x 2  + 32 x 3  + · · · + n 2 x n  + · · · 
is the generating function for the nonegative integer squares. 
(a)  Prove  that  for all k  ∈  N,  the generating  function  for  the nonnegative  integer kth powers  is a 
�
� 
quotient  of  polynomials  in  x.  That  is,  for  all  k  ∈  N  there  are  polynomials Rk (x)  and Sk (x)  such 
that 
(
)  = n k . 
x
R
k
[x n ] 
(

Sk

(2) 

Hint: Observe that the derivative of a quotient of polynomials is also a quotient of polynomials.  It 
is not necessary work out explicit formulas for Rk  and Sk  to prove this part. 

(b)  Conclude that if f (n) is a function on the nonnegative integers deﬁned recursively in the form 
f (n) = af (n − 1) + bf (n − 2) + cf (n − 3) + p(n)αn 
where the a, b, c, α ∈ C and p is a polynomial with complex coefﬁcients, then the generating func­
tion for the sequence f (0), f (1), f (2), . . .  will be a quotient of polynomials in x, and hence there is 
a closed form expression for f (n). 
Hint: Consider 

Rk (αx) 
Sk (αx)
