Problem Set 9 
Due: April 16 

Reading:  Notes Ch.16.1–16.9 

Problem 1. 
Show that for any set of 201 positive integers less than 300, there must be two whose quotient is a 
power of three (with no remainder). 

Problem 2. 
Answer the following questions with a number or a simple formula involving factorials and bino­
mial coefﬁcients. Brieﬂy explain your answers. 

(a)  How many ways are there to order the 26 letters of the alphabet so that no two of the vowels 
a, e, i, o, u appear consecutively and the last letter in the ordering is not a vowel? 
Hint: Every vowel appears to the left of a consonant. 

(b)  How many ways are there to order the 26  letters of the alphabet so that there are at  least two 
consonants immediately following each vowel? 

(c)  In how many different ways can 2n students be paired up? 

(d)  Two n-digit sequences of digits 0,1,. . . ,9 are said to be of the same type if the digits of one are 
a  permutation  of  the  digits  of  the  other.  For  n  = 8,  for  example,  the  sequences  03088929  and 
00238899 are the same type. How many types of n-digit integers are there? 

Problem 3. 
Section  16.8.3  explained why  it  is not possible  to perform  a  four-card variant of  the hidden-card 
magic  trick  with  one  card  hidden.  But  the  Magician  and  her  Assistant  are  determined  to  ﬁnd 
a  way  to  make  a  trick  like  this  work.  They  decide  to  change  the  rules  slightly:  instead  of  the 
Assistant lining up the three unhidden cards for the Magician to see, he will line up all four cards 
with one card face down and the other three visible. We’ll call this the face-down four-card trick. 
For  example,  suppose  the  audience members had  selected  the  cards  9♥,  10♦, A♣,  5♣.  Then  the 
Assistant  could  choose  to  arrange  the  4  cards  in  any  order  so  long  as  one  is  face  down  and  the 
others are visible. Two possibilities are: 

A♣ 

?

10♦

5♣

(a)  Explain why there must be a bipartite matching which will in theory allow the Magician and 
Assistant to perform the face-down four-card trick. 

(b)  There is actually a simple way to perform the face-down four-card trick. 

Case 1.  there are two cards with the same suit:  Say there are two ♠ cards.  The Assistant proceeds as 
in the original card trick: he puts one of the ♠ cards face up as the ﬁrst card. He will place the second 
♠ card  face down.  He  then uses a permutation of  the  face down card and  the remaining  two  face 
up cards to code the offset of the face down card from the ﬁrst card. 
Case 2.  all  four cards have different suits:  Assign numbers 0, 1, 2, 3  to  the  four suits  in some agreed 
upon  way.  The  Assistant  computes,  s,  the  sum  modulo  4  of  the  ranks  of  the  four  cards,  and 
chooses the card with suit s to be placed face down as the ﬁrst card.  He then uses a permutation of 
the remaining three face-up cards to code the rank of the face down card.a 

aThis elegant method was devised in Fall ’09 by student Katie E Everett. 

Explain how in Case 2. the Magician can determine the face down card from the cards the Assistant 
shows her. 

(c)  Explain  how  any  method  for  performing  the  face-down  four-card  trick  can  be  adapted  to 
perform  the  regular  (5-card  hand,  show  4  cards)  with  a  53-card  deck  consisting  of  the  usual  53 
cards along with a 53rd card call the joker. 

Problem 4. 
The  degree  sequence  of  a  simple  graph  is  the  weakly  decreasing  sequence  of  degrees  of  its  ver­
tices.  For example, the degree sequence for the 5-vertex numbered tree pictured in the Figure 1 is 
(2, 2, 2, 1, 1) and for the 7-vertex tree it is (3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1). 
We’re  interested  in  counting how many numbered  trees  there are with a given degree  sequence. 
We’ll  do  this  using  the  bijection  deﬁned  in  Problem  16.5  between  n-vertex  numbered  trees  and 
length n − 2 code words whose characters are integers between 1 and n. 
The occurrence number for a character in a word is the number of times that the character occurs in 
the word. For example, in the word 65622, the occurrence number for 6 is two, and the occurrence 
number  for  5  is  one.  The  occurrence  sequence  of  a  word  is  the  weakly  decreasing  sequence  of 
occurrence numbers of  characters  in  the word.  The occurrence  sequence  for  this word  is  (2, 2, 1) 
because it has two occurrences of each of the characters 6 and 2, and one occurrence of 5. 

(a)  There  is simple relationship between the degree sequence of an n-vertex numbered tree and 
the occurrence sequence of its code. Describe this relationship and explain why it holds. Conclude 
that counting n-vertex numbered trees with a given degree sequence  is the same as counting the 
number of length n − 2 code words with a given occurrence sequence. 
Hint: How many times does a vertex of degree, d, occur in the code?

For simplicity,  let’s focus on counting 9-vertex numbered trees with a given degree sequence.  By 
part (a),  this  is the same as counting the number of  length 7 code words with a given occurrence 
sequence. 
Any length 7 code word has a pattern, which is another length 7 word over the alphabet a,b,c,d,e,f,g 
that has the same occurrence sequence. 
(b)  How many length 7 patterns are there with three occurrences of a, two occurrences of b, and 
one occurrence of c and d? 
(c)  How many ways are there to assign occurrence numbers to integers 1, 2, . . . , 9 so that a code 
word with those occurrence numbers would have the occurrence sequence 3, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0? 
In  general,  to  ﬁnd  the  pattern  of  a  code  word,  list  its  characters  in  decreasing  order  by  num­
ber  of  occurrences,  and  list  characters  with  the  same  number  of  occurrences  in  decreasing  order. 
Then  replace  successive  characters  in  the  list  by  successive  letters  a,b,c,d,e,f,g.  The  code 
word  2468751,  for  example,  has  the  pattern  fecabdg, which  is  obtained  by  replacing  its  char­
acters 8,7,6,5,4,2,1 by a,b,c,d,e,f,g, respectively.  The code word 2449249 has pattern 
caabcab, which is obtained by replacing its characters 4,9,2 by a,b,c, respectively. 
(d)  What  length  7  code word  has  three  occurrences  of  7,  two  occurrences  of  8,  one  occurrence 
each of 2 and 9, and pattern abacbad? 

(e)  Explain why the number of 9-vertex numbered trees with degree sequence (4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) 
is the product of the answers to parts (b) and (c).
