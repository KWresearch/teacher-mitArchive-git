Problem Set 2 
Due:  February 19 

Reading:  Chapter 4, Mathematical Data Types; Chapter 5, First-Order Logic.  (Assigned readings do 
not include the Problem sections.) 
Reminder:  Comments on  the  reading using  the NB  online  annotation  system  are due  at  times  indi­
cated in the online tutor problem set TP.3. Reading Comments count for 5% of the ﬁnal grade. 

Problem 1. 
Let f  : A  �→ B  and g  : B  �→ C  be functions. 
◦ 
(a)  Prove that if the composition g
f  is a bijection, then f  is an injection and g  is a surjection. 
◦ 
f  necessarily a bijection? 

(b)  If f  is an injection and g  is a surjection, then is g

Problem 2. 
There  is a simple and useful way to extend composition of functions to composition of relations. 
→
→
C  and  S  :  A
Namely,  let  R  :  B
B  be  relations.  Then  the  composition  of  R  with  S  is  the 
→ 
◦
binary relation (R S ) : A
C  deﬁned by the rule 
a (R ◦ S ) c ::=  ∃b ∈ B . (b R c) AND  (a S b). 

This agrees with the Deﬁnition 4.3.1 of composition in the special case when R and S are functions. 
We  can  represent  a  relation,  S ,  between  two  sets  A  =  {a1 , . . . , an}  and  B  =  {b1 , . . . , bm}  as  an 
n × m matrix, MS , of zeroes and ones, with the elements of MS  deﬁned by the rule 
MS (i, j ) = 1 

I FF  ai  S bj . 

If  we  represent  relations  as  matrices  in  this  fashion,  then  we  can  compute  the  composition  of 
two relations R and S  by a “boolean” matrix multiplication, ⊗, of their matrices.  Boolean matrix 
multiplication  is  the  same  as  matrix  multiplication  except  that  addition  is  replaced  by  OR  and 
→ 
multiplication  is  replaced  by  AND .  Namely,  suppose  R  :  B
C  is  a  binary  relation with  C  = 
{c1 , . . . , cp}.  So MR  is an m × p matrix. Then MS  ⊗ MR  is an n × p matrix deﬁned by the rule: 
[MS  ⊗ MR ](i, j ) ::= ORm 
k=1
Prove that the matrix representation, MR◦S , of R ◦ S  equals MS  ⊗ MR  (note the reversal of R and 
S ). 

[MS (i, k) AND MR (k , j )].

Problem Set 2 

Problem 3. 
The standard notation for the proposition that a set, x, is a member of a set, y , is 
x ∈ y . 

Formulas built up from membership formulas of this form using  logical connectives and quanti­
ﬁers  are  called  the  logical  formulas  of  set  theory.  For  example,  to  say  x  =�
y  with  a  formula  of  set 
theory, we could write 
∃z  (z  ∈ x) XOR  (z  ∈ y). 

(2) 

(a)  Write a formula of set theory that means that x is the empty set. 
(b)  Write a formula of set theory that means that x ⊆ y , that is, x is a subset of y . 
(c)  Write a formula of set theory that means that x ⊂ y , that is, x is a proper subset of y . 
(d)  Write a formula of set theory that means that y  is the powerset of x. 

(e)  Write a formula, Three(y), of set theory that means that y has at least three elements. 

(f)  Write a formula of set theory that means that y has exactly two elements. 

(g)  A set, x, is member-minimal in a set y iff x is a member of y and no element of y is a member of 
x. Write a formula, MM(x, y), of set theory that means that x is member-minimal in y . 

(h)  The Foundation Axiom of Zermelo-Fraenkel  set  theory  asserts  that  every nonempty  set has  a 
member-minimal  element.  Express  the  Foundation Axiom  as  a  formula  of  set  theory.  (You may 
use the formula MM(x, y) of part (g) as an abbreviation in your formula). 

Problem 4. 
Prove  that  for any sets A, B , C , and D ,  if A × B  and C × D  are disjoint,  then either A and C  are 
disjoint or B  and D are disjoint.
