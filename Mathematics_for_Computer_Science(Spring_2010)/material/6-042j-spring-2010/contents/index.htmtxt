***** Course Description *****
This subject offers an introduction to Discrete Mathematics oriented toward
Computer Science and Engineering. The subject coverage divides roughly into
thirds:
   1. Fundamental concepts of mathematics: definitions, proofs, sets,
      functions, relations.
   2. Discrete structures: graphs, state machines, modular arithmetic,
      counting.
   3. Discrete probability theory.
On completion of 6.042, students will be able to explain and apply the basic
methods of discrete (noncontinuous) mathematics in Computer Science. They will
be able to use these methods in subsequent courses in the design and analysis
of algorithms, computability theory, software engineering, and computer
systems.
