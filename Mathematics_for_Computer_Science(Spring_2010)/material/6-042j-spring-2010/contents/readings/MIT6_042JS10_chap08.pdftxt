Directed graphs 

8.1  Digraphs 

A directed graph (digraph for short)  is formally  the same as a binary relation, R, on 
a set, A —that is, a relation whose domain and codomain are the same set, A.  But 
we describe digraphs as though they were diagrams, with elements of A pictured 
as  points  on  the  plane  and  arrows  drawn  between  related  points.  The  elements 
of A are  referred  to as  the vertices of  the digraph,  and  the pairs  (a, b)  ∈  graph (R) 
→
b is a more suggestive alternative for the pair (a, b).
are directed edges. Writing a
Directed edges are also called arrows. 
For  example,  the  divisibility  relation  on  {1, 2, . . . , 12}  is  could  be  pictured  by 
the digraph:

CHAPTER 8.  DIRECTED GRAPHS 

8.1.1  Paths in Digraphs 
Picturing digraphs with points and arrows makes it natural to talk about following 
a path of successive edges  through  the graph.  For example,  in  the digraph of Fig­
ure 8.1, a path might start at vertex 1, successively follow the edges from vertex 1 
to vertex 2, from 2 to 4, from 4 to 12, and then from 12 to 12 twice (or as many times 
as you  like).  We  can  represent  the path with  the  sequence of  sucessive vertices  it 
went through, in this case: 

1, 2, 4, 12, 12, 12. 
So a path is  just a sequence of vertices, with consecutive vertices on the path con­
nected by directed edges. Here is a formal deﬁnition: 
Deﬁnition 8.1.1.  A path in a digraph is a sequence of vertices a0 , . . . , ak  with k  ≥  0 
such that ai  → ai+1  is an edge of the digraph for i = 0, 1, . . . , k − 1. The path is said 
to start at a0 , to end at ak , and the length of the path is deﬁned to be k .  The path is 
j , then ai  =� aj . 
simple iff all the ai ’s are different, that is, if i =�
Note  that  a  single  vertex  counts  as  length  zero  path  that  begins  and  ends  at 
itself. 
It’s pretty natural to talk about the edges  in a path, but technically, paths only 
→ 
have points, not edges. So to instead, we’ll say a path traverses an edge a
b when 
a and b are consecutive vertices in the path. 
For  any  digraph,  R,  we  can  deﬁne  some  new  relations  on  vertices  based  on 
paths, namely, the path relation, R∗ , and the positive-length path relation, R+ : 
a R∗  b ::= there is a path in R from a to b,

a R+  b ::= there is a positive length path in R from a to b.

By  the deﬁnition of path, both R∗  and R+  are  transitive.  Since edges count as 
length  one paths,  the  edges  of R+  include  all  the  edges  of R.  The  edges  of R∗  in 
turn include all the edges of R+  and,  in addition include an edge (self-loop) from 
each vertex to itself.  The self-loops get included in R∗  because of the a length zero 
paths in R.  So R∗  is reﬂexive.  1 

8.2  Picturing Relational Properties 

Many  of  the  relational  properties  we’ve  discussed  have  natural  descriptions  in 
terms of paths.  For example: 

Reﬂexivity:  All  vertices  have  self-loops  (a  self-loop  at  a  vertex  is  an  arrow  going 
from the vertex back to itself). 

Irreﬂexivity:  No vertices have self-loops. 

Antisymmetry:  At most one (directed) edge between different vertices. 
1 In many texts, R+  is called the transitive closure and R∗  is called the reﬂexive transitive closure of R. 

8.3.  COMPOSITION OF RELATIONS 

131 

Asymmetry:  No self-loops and at most one (directed) edge between different ver­
tices. 

Transitivity:  Short-circuits—for  any  path  through  the  graph,  there  is  an  arrow 
from the ﬁrst vertex to the last vertex on the path. 

Symmetry:  A binary  relation R  is  symmetric  iff aRb  implies  bRa  for  all a, b  in  the 
domain of R.  That  is,  if  there  is an edge  from a  to  b,  there  is also one  in  the 
reverse direction. 

8.3  Composition of Relations 

There  is  a  simple way  to  extend  composition  of  functions  to  composition  of  rela­
tions, and this gives another way to talk about paths in digraphs. 
→
→
C  and S  : A
Let R  : B
B  be relations.  Then the composition of R with S
◦
→ 
is the binary relation (R S ) : A
C  deﬁned by the rule 
a (R ◦ S ) c ::=  ∃b ∈ B . (b R c) AND  (a S b). 

This agrees with the Deﬁnition 4.3.1 of composition in the special case when R and 
S  are functions. 
Now when R is a digraph, it makes sense to compose R with itself.  Then if we 
let Rn  denote the composition of R with itself n times, it’s easy to check that Rn  is 
the length-n path relation: 

a Rn  b 

iff 

there is a length n path in R from a to b. 

This  even  works  for  n  = 0,  if  we  adopt  the  convention  that  R0  is  the  identity 
relation IdA  on the set, A, of vertices. That is, (a IdA  b) iff a = b. 

8.4  Directed Acyclic Graphs 

Deﬁnition 8.4.1.  A cycle in a digraph is deﬁned by a path that begins and ends at 
the same vertex.  This includes the cycle of length zero that begins and ends at the 
vertex.  A  directed  acyclic  graph  (DAG)  is  a  directed  graph  with  no  positive  length 
cycles. 
A  simple  cycle  in a digraph  is  a  cycle whose vertices are distinct  except  for  the 
beginning and end vertices. 

DAG’s can be an economical way to represent partial orders.  For example, the 
direct prerequisite relation between MIT subjects in Chapter 7 was used to determine 
the  partial  order  of  indirect  prerequisites  on  subjects.  This  indirect  prerequisite 
partial order is precisely the positive length path relation of the direct prerequisites. 

Lemma 8.4.2.  If D  is a DAG, then D+  is a strict partial order. 

132 

CHAPTER 8.  DIRECTED GRAPHS 

Proof.  We know that D+  is transitive. Also, a positive length path from a vertex to 
itself would  be  a  cycle,  so  there  are  no  such  paths.  This means D+  is  irreﬂexive, 
� 
which implies it is a strict partial order (see problem 7.8). 

It’s easy to check that conversely, the graph of any strict partial order is a DAG. 
The divisibility partial order can also be more economically represented by the 
path relation in a DAG. A DAG whose path relation is divisibility on {1, 2, . . . , 12}

is  shown  in  Figure  8.2;  the  arrowheads  are  omitted  in  the  Figure,  and  edges  are 
understood to point upwards.

Figure 8.2: A DAG whose Path Relation is Divisibility on {1, 2, . . . , 12}. 

If we’re using a DAG  to  represent a partial order —so all we care about  is  the 
the  path  relation  of  the  DAG —we  could  replace  the  DAG  with  any  other  DAG 
with  the  same  path  relation.  This  raises  the  question  of  ﬁnding  a  DAG with  the 
same  path  relation  but  the  smallest  number  of  edges.  This  DAG  turns  out  to  be 
unique and easy to ﬁnd (see problem 8.2).

from a  to  b and every path  from a  to  b  traverses  this edge.  If a  covers  b,  the edge 
from a to b is called a covering edge. 
(a)	 What are the covering edges in the following DAG? 

(b)  Let covering (D) be the subgraph of D  consisting of only the covering edges. 
Suppose D  is a ﬁnite DAG. Explain why covering (D) has  the same positive path 
relation as D . 
Hint: Consider longest paths between a pair of vertices. 

(c)  Show that if two DAG’s have the same positive path relation,  then they have 
the same set of covering edges. 

(d)  Conclude  that  covering (D)  is  the  unique  DAG  with  the  smallest  number  of 
edges among all digraphs with the same positive path relation as D . 
The following examples show that the above results don’t work in general for 
digraphs with cycles.

edges, but not the same positive path relation (Hint:  Self-loops.)
