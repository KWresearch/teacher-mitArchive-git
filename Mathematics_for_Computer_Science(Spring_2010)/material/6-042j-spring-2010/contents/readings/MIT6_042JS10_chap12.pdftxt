CHAPTER 12.  PLANAR GRAPHS 

Can  each  quadapus  simultaneously  shake  hands  with  every  other  in  such  a 
way that no arms cross? 
Informally,  a planar graph  is a graph  that  can be drawn  in  the plane  so  that no 
edges cross, as in a map of showing the borders of countries or states.  Thus, these 
two puzzles are asking whether the graphs below are planar; that is, whether they 
can be redrawn so that no edges cross. The ﬁrst graph is called the complete bipartite 
graph, K3,3 , and the second is K5 .

In each case, the answer is, “No— but almost!”  In fact, each drawing would be 
possible if any single edge were removed. 
Planar  graphs  have  applications  in  circuit  layout  and  are  helpful  in  display­
ing  graphical  data,  for  example,  program  ﬂow  charts,  organizational  charts,  and 
scheduling conﬂicts. We will treat them as a recursive data type and use structural 
induction to establish their basic properties. Then we’ll be able to describe a simple 
recursive procedure to color any planar graph with ﬁve colors, and also prove that 
there is no uniform way to place n satellites around the globe unless n = 4, 6, 8, 12, 
or 20. 

12.2.  CONTINUOUS & DISCRETE FACES 

235 

When wires are arranged on a surface, like a circuit board or microchip, crossings 
require troublesome three-dimensional structures. When Steve Wozniak designed 
the disk drive  for  the  early Apple  II  computer,  he  struggled mightly  to  achieve  a 
nearly planar design: 

For two weeks, he worked late each night to make a satisfactory design. 
When he was ﬁnished, he found that if he moved a connector he could 
cut down  on  feedthroughs, making  the  board more  reliable.  To make 
that move, however, he had to start over in his design. This time it only 
took  twenty  hours.  He  then  saw  another  feedthrough  that  could  be 
eliminated, and again started over on his design. ”The ﬁnal design was 
generally recognized by computer engineers as brilliant and was by en­
gineering aesthetics beautiful.  Woz  later  said,  ’It’s  something you  can 
only do if you’re the engineer and the PC board layout person yourself. 
That was an artistic layout. The board has virtually no feedthroughs.’”a

12.2  Continuous & Discrete Faces 

Planar  graphs  are  graphs  that  can  be  drawn  in  the  plane —like  familiar maps  of 
countries  or  states.  “Drawing”  the  graph  means  that  each  vertex  of  the  graph 
corresponds to a distinct point  in the plane, and  if two vertices are adjacent,  their 
vertices are connected by a smooth, non-self-intersecting curve. None of the curves 
may  “cross” —the  only  points  that  may  appear  on  more  than  one  curve  are  the 
vertex points.  These  curves  are  the boundaries of  connected  regions of  the plane 
called the continuous faces of the drawing. 
For  example,  the  drawing  in  Figure  12.1  has  four  continuous  faces.  Face  IV, 
which extends off to inﬁnity in all directions, is called the outside face. 
This  deﬁnition  of  planar  graphs  is  perfectly  precise,  but  completely  unsatis­
fying:  it  invokes  smooth  curves  and  continuous  regions  of  the  plane  to  deﬁne  a 
property  of  a  discrete  data  type.  So  the  ﬁrst  thing  we’d  like  to  ﬁnd  is  a  discrete 
data type that represents planar drawings. 
The  clue  to  how  to  do  this  is  to  notice  that  the  vertices  along  the  boundary 
of  each  of  the  faces  in  Figure  12.1  form  a  simple  cycle.  For  example,  labeling  the 
vertices as in Figure 12.2, the simple cycles for the face boundaries are 

abca 

abda 

bcdb 

acda. 

Since every edge in the drawing appears on the boundaries of exactly two contin­
uous  faces,  every  edge  of  the  simple  graph  appears  on  exactly  two  of  the  simple 
cycles. 
Vertices around the boundaries of states and countries in an ordinary map are

always simple cycles, but oceans are slightly messier. The ocean boundary is the set 
of all boundaries of islands and continents in the ocean;  it is a set of simple cycles 
(this  can  happen  for  countries  too —like  Bangladesh).  But  this  happens  because 
islands  (and  the  two parts of Bangladesh) are not connected  to each other.  So we 
can dispose of this complication by treating each connected component separately. 
But  general  planar  graphs,  even when  they  are  connected, may  be  a  bit more 
complicated  than maps.  For  example  a  planar  graph may  have  a  “bridge,”  as  in 
Figure 12.3. Now the cycle around the outer face is 

abcefgecda. 

This is not a simple cycle, since it has to traverse the bridge c—e twice. 
Planar  graphs  may  also  have  “dongles,”  as  in  Figure  12.4.  Now  the  cycle 
around the inner face is

Figure 12.4: A Planar Drawing with a Dongle. 

because it has to traverse every edge of the dongle twice —once “coming” and once 
“going.” 
But  bridges  and  dongles  are  really  the  only  complications,  which  leads  us  to 
the discrete data  type of planar  embeddings  that we can use  in place of continuous 
planar drawings.  Namely, we’ll deﬁne  a planar  embedding  recursively  to  be  the 
set of boundary-tracing cycles we could get drawing one edge after another. 

12.3  Planar Embeddings 

By thinking of the process of drawing a planar graph edge by edge, we can give a 
useful recursive deﬁnition of planar embeddings. 

Deﬁnition 12.3.1.  A planar embedding of a connected graph consists of a nonempty 
set of cycles of the graph called the discrete faces of the embedding.  Planar embed­

adbcgfertsuyxwv238 

CHAPTER 12.  PLANAR GRAPHS 

dings are deﬁned recursively as follows: 
•	 Base case:  If G  is a graph consisting of a single vertex,  v ,  then a planar em­
bedding of G has one discrete face, namely the length zero cycle, v . 
•	 Constructor Case:  (split a face) Suppose G is a connected graph with a planar 
embedding, and suppose a and b are distinct, nonadjacent vertices of G that 
appear on some discrete face, γ , of the planar embedding. That is, γ is a cycle 
of the form 
· · · 
a . . . b 
a.
Then  the  graph  obtained  by  adding  the  edge  a—b  to  the  edges  of  G  has  a 
planar  embedding  with  the  same  discrete  faces  as  G,  except  that  face  γ  is 
replaced by the two discrete faces1 
a . . . ba  and  ab · · · a, 
as illustrated in Figure 12.5. 

Figure 12.5: The Split a Face Case. 

•	 Constructor  Case:  (add  a  bridge)  Suppose  G  and  H  are  connected  graphs 
with planar embeddings and disjoint sets of vertices.  Let a be a vertex on a 
discrete face, γ , in the embedding of G. That is, γ  is of the form 

a . . . a. 
1  There  is one exception  to  this rule.  If G  is a  line graph beginning with a and ending with b,  then 
the cycles  into which γ  splits are actually the same.  That’s because adding edge a—b creates a simple 
cycle graph, Cn , that divides the plane into an “inner ” and an “outer ” region with the same border.  In 
order  to maintain  the  correspondence  between  continuous  faces  and  discrete  faces, we  have  to  allow 
two “copies” of  this same cycle  to count as discrete  faces.  But since  this  is  the only situation  in which 
two  faces  are  actually  the  same  cycle,  this  exception  is  better  explained  in  a  footnote  than mentioned 
explicitly in the deﬁnition.

239 

Similarly, let b be a vertex on a discrete face, δ , in the embedding of H , so δ is 
of the form 

· · · 
b 
b.

Then the graph obtained by connecting G and H  with a new edge, a—b, has 
a planar embedding whose discrete  faces are  the union of  the discrete  faces 
of G and H , except that faces γ  and δ are replaced by one new face 
· · · 
a . . . ab 
ba.

This is illustrated in Figure 12.6, where the faces of G and H  are: 
G : {axyza,  axya,  ayza} 
H  : {btuvwb,  btvwb,  tuvt} , 

and after adding the bridge a—b, there is a single connected graph with faces 
{axyzabtuvwba,  axya,  ayza,  btvwb,  tuvt} . 

Figure 12.6: The Add Bridge Case. 

An arbitrary graph  is planar  iff each of  its connected components has a planar 
embedding.

CHAPTER 12.  PLANAR GRAPHS 

12.4  What outer face? 

Notice  that  the  deﬁnition  of  planar  embedding  does  not  distinguish  an  “outer ” 
face. There really isn’t any need to distinguish one. 
In fact, a planar embedding could be drawn with any given face on the outside. 
An  intuitive explanation of  this  is  to  think of drawing  the embedding on a  sphere 
instead of the plane.  Then any face can be made the outside face by “puncturing” 
that  face  of  the  sphere,  stretching  the  puncture  hole  to  a  circle  around  the  rest  of 
the faces, and ﬂattening the circular drawing onto the plane. 
So pictures  that show different “outside” boundaries may actually be  illustra­
tions of the same planar embedding. 
This  is what  justiﬁes  the  “add  bridge”  case  in  a planar  embedding:  whatever 
face is chosen in the embeddings of each of the disjoint planar graphs, we can draw 
a bridge between  them without needing  to cross any other edges  in  the drawing, 
because we can assume the bridge connects two “outer ” faces. 

12.5  Euler ’s Formula 

The  value  of  the  recursive  deﬁnition  is  that  it  provides  a  powerful  technique  for 
proving properties of planar graphs, namely, structural induction. 
One  of  the most  basic properties  of  a  connected planar  graph  is  that  its  num­
ber of vertices and edges determines the number of faces in every possible planar 
embedding: 

Theorem 12.5.1 (Euler ’s Formula).  If a connected graph has a planar embedding, then 
v − e + f  = 2 

where v  is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f  is the number of faces. 
For example, in Figure 12.1, |V | = 4, |E | = 6, and f  = 4. Sure enough, 4−6+4 = 
2, as Euler ’s Formula claims. 

Proof.  The proof is by structural induction on the deﬁnition of planar embeddings. 
Let P (E ) be the proposition that v − e + f  = 2 for an embedding, E . 
Base case:  (E  is the one vertex planar embedding).  By deﬁnition, v  = 1, e = 0, 
and f  = 1, so P (E ) indeed holds. 
Constructor  case:  (split a  face) Suppose G  is a  connected graph with a planar 
embedding, and suppose a and b are distinct, nonadjacent vertices of G that appear 
· · · 
on some discrete face, γ  = a . . . b 
a, of the planar embedding. 
Then the graph obtained by adding the edge a—b to the edges of G has a planar 
embedding with  one more  face  and  one more  edge  than  G.  So  the  quantity  v − 
e + f  will remain the same for both graphs, and since by structural induction this 
quantity is 2 for G’s embedding, it’s also 2 for the embedding of G with the added 
edge.  So P  holds for the constructed embedding. 

12.6.  NUMBER OF EDGES VERSUS VERTICES 

241 

Constructor  case:  (add  bridge)  Suppose G  and H  are  connected  graphs with 
planar embeddings and disjoint sets of vertices. Then connecting these two graphs 
with a bridge merges the two bridged faces into a single face, and leaves all other 
faces  unchanged.  So  the  bridge  operation  yields  a  planar  embedding  of  a  con­
nected  graph  with  vG  + vH  vertices,  eG  + eH  + 1  edges,  and  fG  + fH  − 1  faces. 
But 
(vG  + vH ) − (eG  + eH  + 1) + (fG  + fH  − 1) 
= (vG  − eG  + fG ) + (vH  − eH  + fH ) − 2 
= (2) + (2) − 2 
= 2. 
So v − e + f  remains equal to 2 for the constructed embedding. That is, P  also holds 
in this case. 
This completes  the proof of  the constructor cases,  and  the  theorem  follows by 
� 
structural induction. 

(by structural induction hypothesis) 

12.6  Number of Edges versus Vertices 

Like Euler ’s formula, the following lemmas follow by structural induction directly 
from the deﬁnition of planar embedding. 
Lemma 12.6.1.  In a planar embedding of a connected graph,  each edge  is  traversed once 
by each of two different faces, or is traversed exactly twice by one face. 
Lemma  12.6.2.  In  a  planar  embedding  of  a  connected  graph with  at  least  three  vertices, 
each face is of length at least three. 
Corollary 12.6.3.  Suppose a connected planar graph has v ≥ 3 vertices and e edges. Then 
e ≤ 3v − 6. 
Proof.  By deﬁnition, a connected graph is planar iff it has a planar embedding.  So 
suppose  a  connected  graph with  v  vertices  and  e  edges  has  a  planar  embedding 
with  f  faces.  By  Lemma  12.6.1,  every  edge  is  traversed  exactly  twice  by  the  face 
boundaries.  So the sum of the lengths of the face boundaries is exactly 2e. Also by 
Lemma  12.6.2, when  v  ≥  3,  each  face boundary  is of  length  at  least  three,  so  this 
sum is at least 3f . This implies that 

3f  ≤ 2e. 
But f  = e − v + 2 by Euler ’s formula, and substituting into (12.1) gives 
3(e − v + 2) ≤ 2e 
e − 3v + 6 ≤ 0 
e ≤ 3v − 6

CHAPTER 12.  PLANAR GRAPHS 

Corollary  12.6.3  lets  us  prove  that  the  quadapi  can’t  all  shake  hands  with­
out crossing.  Representing quadapi by vertices and  the necessary handshakes by 
edges, we get  the  complete graph, K5 .  Shaking hands without  crossing amounts 
to showing that K5  is planar. But K5  is connected, has 5 vertices and 10 edges, and 
10 >  3 5 − 6.  This violates the condition of Corollary 12.6.3 required for K5  to be 
· 
planar, which proves 

Lemma 12.6.4.  K5  is not planar. 

Another consequence is 

Lemma 12.6.5.  Every planar graph has a vertex of degree at most ﬁve. 

Proof.  If  every  vertex  had degree  at  least  6,  then  the  sum  of  the  vertex degrees  is 
at least 6v , but since the sum equals 2e, we have e ≥  3v  contradicting the fact that 
e ≤ 3v − 6 < 3v by Corollary 12.6.3.

12.7  Planar Subgraphs 

If you draw a graph in the plane by repeatedly adding edges that don’t cross, you 
clearly  could  add  the  edges  in  any  other  order  and  still  wind  up  with  the  same 
drawing.  This is so basic that we might presume that our recursively deﬁned pla­
nar  embeddings  have  this  property.  But  that wouldn’t  be  fair:  we  really  need  to 
prove it. After all, the recursive deﬁnition of planar embedding was pretty techni­
cal —maybe we got it a little bit wrong, with the result that our embeddings don’t 
have this basic draw-in-any-order property. 
Now  any  ordering  of  edges  can  be  obtained  just  by  repeatedly  switching  the 
order  of  successive  edges,  and  if  you  think  about  the  recursive  deﬁnition  of  em­
bedding  for  a minute,  you  should  realize  that  you  can  switch  any  pair  of  succes­
sive edges if you can just switch the last two.  So it all comes down to the following 
lemma. 

Lemma 12.7.1.  Suppose that, starting  from some embeddings of planar graphs with dis­
joint sets of vertices, it is possible by two successive applications of constructor operations 
to add edges e and  then f  to obtain a planar embedding, F .  Then starting  from  the same 
embeddings,  it  is  also  possible  to  obtain  F  by  adding  f  and  then  e  with  two  successive 
applications of constructor operations. 

We’ll leave the proof of Lemma 12.7.1 to Problem 12.6. 

Corollary  12.7.2.  Suppose  that,  starting  from  some  embeddings  of  planar  graphs  with 
disjoint sets of vertices, it is possible to add a sequence of edges e0 , e1 , . . . , en  by successive 
applications  of  constructor  operations  to  obtain  a  planar  embedding,  F .  Then  starting 
from  the  same  embeddings,  it  is  also  possible  to  obtain  F  by  applications  of  constructor 
operations that successively add any permutation2  of the edges e0 , e1 , . . . , en . 
2 If π  : {0, 1, . . . , n} → {0, 1, . . . , n} is a bijection, then the sequence eπ(0) , eπ(1) , . . . , eπ(n)  is called 
a permutation of the sequence e0 , e1 , . . . , en . 

12.8.  PLANAR 5-COLORABILITY 

243 

Corollary 12.7.3.  Deleting an edge from a planar graph leaves a planar graph. 

Proof.  By Corollary 12.7.2, we may assume the deleted edge was the last one added 
in  constructing  an  embedding  of  the  graph.  So  the  embedding  to which  this  last 
� 
edge was added must be an embedding of the graph without that edge. 
Since we can delete a vertex by deleting all its incident edges, Corollary 12.7.3 
immediately implies 

Corollary 12.7.4.  Deleting a vertex from a planar graph, along with all its incident edges 
of course, leaves another planar graph. 

A  subgraph of  a graph, G,  is  any graph whose  set of vertices  is  a  subset of  the 
vertices of G and whose set of edges is a subset of the set of edges of G.  So we can 
summarize Corollaries 12.7.3 and 12.7.4 and their consequences in a Theorem. 

Theorem 12.7.5.  Any subgraph of a planar graph is planar. 

12.8  Planar 5-Colorability 

We need to know one more property of planar graphs in order to prove that planar 
graphs are 5-colorable. 

Lemma  12.8.1.  Merging  two  adjacent  vertices  of  a  planar  graph  leaves  another  planar 
graph. 

Here merging  two  adjacent  vertices,  n1  and n2  of  a  graph means deleting  the 
two vertices and then replacing them by a new “merged” vertex, m, adjacent to all 
the vertices that were adjacent to either of n1  or n2 , as illustrated in Figure 12.7. 
Lemma  12.8.1  can  be  proved  by  structural  induction,  but  the  proof  is  kind  of 
boring,  and we hope  you’ll  be  relieved  that we’re  going  to  omit  it.  (If  you  insist, 
we can add it to the next problem set.) 
Now we’ve got all the simple facts we need to prove 5-colorability. 

Theorem 12.8.2.  Every planar graph is ﬁve-colorable. 

Proof.  The  proof  will  be  by  strong  induction  on  the  number,  v ,  of  vertices,  with 
induction hypothesis: 

Every planar graph with v vertices is ﬁve-colorable. 
Base cases (v ≤ 5):  immediate. 
Inductive  case:  Suppose G  is  a planar  graph with  v + 1  vertices.  We will de­
scribe a ﬁve-coloring of G. 
First, choose a vertex, g , of G with degree at most 5; Lemma 12.6.5 guarantees 
there will be such a vertex. 
Case  1  (deg (g)  <  5):  Deleting  g  from  G  leaves  a  graph,  H ,  that  is  planar  by 
Lemma 12.7.4, and, since H  has v vertices, it is ﬁve-colorable by induction hypoth­
esis.  Now deﬁne a ﬁve coloring of G as follows:  use the ﬁve-coloring of H  for all

the vertices besides g , and assign one of the ﬁve colors to g  that is not the same as 
the color assigned to any of its neighbors.  Since there are fewer than 5 neighbors, 
there will always be such a color available for g . 
Case  2  (deg (g) = 5):  If  the  ﬁve  neighbors  of  g  in G were  all  adjacent  to  each 
other, then these ﬁve vertices would form a nonplanar subgraph isomorphic to K5 , 
contradicting Theorem 12.7.5.  So there must be two neighbors, n1  and n2 , of g that 
are not adjacent.  Now merge n1  and g  into a new vertex, m,  as  in Figure 12.7.  In 
this new graph, n2  is adjacent  to m, and  the graph  is planar by Lemma 12.8.1.  So 
we  can  then  merge  m  and  n2  into  a  another  new  vertex,  m� ,  resulting  in  a  new 
graph, G� , which by Lemma 12.8.1 is also planar. Now G�  has v − 1 vertices and so 
is ﬁve-colorable by the induction hypothesis. 
Now  deﬁne  a  ﬁve  coloring  of G  as  follows:  use  the  ﬁve-coloring  of G�  for  all 
the vertices besides g , n1  and n2 .  Next assign  the color of m�  in G�  to be  the color 
of  the  neighbors  n1  and  n2 .  Since  n1  and  n2  are  not  adjacent  in G,  this  deﬁnes  a 
proper  ﬁve-coloring  of G  except  for  vertex  g .  But  since  these  two  neighbors  of  g 
have  the  same  color,  the  neighbors  of  g  have  been  colored  using  fewer  than  ﬁve 
colors  altogether.  So  complete  the ﬁve-coloring  of G  by  assigning  one  of  the ﬁve 
colors to g  that is not the same as any of the colors assigned to its neighbors. 
� 

A  graph  obtained  from  a  graph,  G,  be  repeatedly  deleting  vertices,  deleting 
edges, and merging adjacent vertices is called a minor of G.  Since K5  and K3,3  are 
not planar, Lemmas 12.7.3, 12.7.4, and 12.8.1 immediately imply: 

Corollary 12.8.3.  A graph which has K5  or K3,3  as a minor is not planar. 

We don’t have time to prove it, but the converse of Corollary 12.8.3 is also true. 
This gives the following famous, very elegant, and purely discrete characterization 
of planar graphs: 

Theorem 12.8.4 (Kuratowksi).  A graph is not planar iff it has K5  or K3,3  as a minor. 

12.9  Classifying Polyhedra 

The Pythagoreans had two great mathematical secrets, the irrationality of 
a geometric construct that we’re about to rediscover! 
A polyhedron is a convex, three-dimensional region bounded by a ﬁnite number 
of polygonal faces.  If the faces are identical regular polygons and an equal number 
of polygons meet at each corner, then the polyhedron is regular. Three examples of 
regular polyhedra are shown below: the tetrahedron, the cube, and the octahedron.

246 

CHAPTER 12.  PLANAR GRAPHS 

We  can  determine  how  many  more  regular  polyhedra  there  are  by  thinking 
about  planarity.  Suppose  we  took  any  polyhedron  and  placed  a  sphere  inside 
it.  Then we could project  the polyhedron  face boundaries onto  the sphere, which 
would give  an  image  that was  a planar graph  embedded on  the  sphere, with  the 
images  of  the  corners  of  the  polyhedron  corresponding  to  vertices  of  the  graph. 
But we’ve already observed that embeddings on a sphere are the same as embed-
dings on the plane, so Euler ’s formula for planar graphs can help guide our search 
for regular polyhedra. 
For example, planar embeddings of the three polyhedra above look like this:

Let m be the number of faces that meet at each corner of a polyhedron, and let 
n  be  the  number  of  sides  on  each  face.  In  the  corresponding  planar  graph,  there 
are m  edges  incident  to  each  of  the  v  vertices.  Since  each  edge  is  incident  to  two 
vertices, we know: 

mv = 2e 
Also, each face is bounded by n edges.  Since each edge is on the boundary of two 
faces, we have: 

nf  = 2e 
Solving  for v  and f  in  these equations and  then substituting  into Euler ’s  formula 
gives: 

2e

− e +  = 2 
n 

which simpliﬁes to

This last equation (12.2) places strong restrictions on the structure of a polyhedron. 
Every nondegenerate polygon has at least 3 sides, so n ≥ 3. And at least 3 polygons 
must meet  to  form a corner, so m  ≥  3.  On  the other hand,  if either n or m were 6 
or more, then the left side of the equation could be at most 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2, which

is  less  than  the  right  side.  Checking  the ﬁnitely-many  cases  that  remain  turns up 
only ﬁve  solutions.  For  each  valid  combination  of n  and m, we  can  compute  the 
associated number  of  vertices  v ,  edges  e,  and  faces  f .  And polyhedra with  these 
properties do actually exist:

The last polyhedron in this list, the dodecahedron, was the other great mathemat­
ical  secret of  the Pythagorean  sect.  These ﬁve,  then,  are  the only possible  regular 
polyhedra. 
So  if  you  want  to  put  more  than  20  geocentric  satellites  in  orbit  so  that  they 
uniformly blanket the globe —tough luck!

Problem 12.1. 

(a)  Describe  an  isomorphism  between  graphs  G1  and  G2 ,  and  another  isomor­
phism between G2  and G3 . 

(b)  Why does part (a) imply that there is an isomorphism between graphs G1  and 
G3 ?

Let G and H be planar graphs. An embedding EG  of G is isomorphic to an embed­

ding EH  of H  iff there is an isomorphism from G to H  that also maps each face of

EG  to a face of EH .

(c)  Describe a way to construct the embedding in Figure 4 according to the recur­
sive Deﬁnition  12.3.1 of planar  embedding.  For  each  application of  a  constructor 
rule,  be  sure  to  indicate  the  faces  (cycles)  to which  the  rule was  applied  and  the 
cycles which result from the application.

tices is bipartite, then 
e ≤ 2v − 4. 
(12.3) 
Hint:  Similar to the proof of Corollary 12.6.3 that for planar graphs e ≤ 3v − 6. 
(b)  Conclude that that K3,3  is not planar.  (K3,3  is the graph with six vertices and 
an edge from each of the ﬁrst three vertices to each of the last three.) 

Problem 12.4. 
Prove  the  following assertions by  structural  induction on  the deﬁnition of planar 
embedding. 
(a)  In a planar embedding of a graph, each edge is traversed a total of two times 
by the faces of the embedding. 

(b)  In a planar embedding of a connected graph with at least three vertices, each 
face is of length at least three.
