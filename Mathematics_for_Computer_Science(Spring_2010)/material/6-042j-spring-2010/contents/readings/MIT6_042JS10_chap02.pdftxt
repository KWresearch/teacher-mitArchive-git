The Well Ordering Principle 

Every nonempty set of nonnegative integers has a smallest element. 

This  statement  is  known  as  The  Well  Ordering  Principle.  Do  you  believe  it? 
Seems  sort  of  obvious,  right?  But  notice  how  tight  it  is:  it  requires  a  nonempty 
set —it’s  false  for  the  empty  set which  has  no  smallest  element  because  it  has  no 
elements  at  all!  And  it  requires  a  set  of  nonnegative  integers  —it’s  false  for  the 
set  of  negative  integers  and  also  false  for  some  sets  of  nonnegative  rationals —for 
example,  the  set  of  positive  rationals.  So,  the  Well  Ordering  Principle  captures 
something special about the nonnegative integers. 

2.1  Well Ordering Proofs 

While the Well Ordering Principle may seem obvious, it’s hard to see offhand why 
it is useful. But in fact, it provides one of the most important proof rules in discrete 
mathematics.

In fact, looking back, we took the Well Ordering Principle for granted in prov­
2 is irrational.  That proof assumed that for any positive integers m and 
ing that 
n, the fraction m/n can be written in lowest terms, that is, in the form m�/n�  where 
m�  and n�  are positive integers with no common factors.  How do we know this is 
always possible? 
Suppose  to  the contrary  that  there were m, n  ∈  Z+  such  that  the  fraction m/n 
cannot be written in lowest terms. Now let C be the set of positive integers that are 
numerators of such  fractions.  Then m  ∈  C ,  so C  is nonempty.  Therefore, by Well 
Ordering, there must be a smallest integer, m0  ∈ C .  So by deﬁnition of C , there is 
an integer n0  > 0 such that 

the fraction 

m0  cannot be written in lowest terms. 
n0

CHAPTER 2.  THE WELL ORDERING PRINCIPLE 

This means that m0  and n0  must have a common factor, p > 1. But 

m0/p  m0 
= 
, 
n0/p 
n0 

so  any way  of  expressing  the  left hand  fraction  in  lowest  terms would  also work 
for m0 /n0 , which implies 

the fraction 

m0 /p
n0/p 

cannot be in written in lowest terms either. 

So by deﬁnition of C , the numerator, m0/p, is in C .  But m0 /p < m0 , which contra­
dicts the fact that m0  is the smallest element of C . 
Since  the  assumption  that  C  is  nonempty  leads  to  a  contradiction,  it  follows 
that C  must be empty.  That is, that there are no numerators of fractions that can’t 
be written in lowest terms, and hence there are no such fractions at all. 
We’ve been using the Well Ordering Principle on the sly from early on! 

2.2  Template for Well Ordering Proofs 

More  generally,  there  is  a  standard way  to use Well Ordering  to prove  that  some 
property, P (n) holds  for  every nonnegative  integer, n.  Here  is a  standard way  to 
organize such a well ordering proof: 

To prove that “P (n) is true for all n ∈ N” using the Well Ordering Principle: 

•	 Deﬁne the set, C , of counterexamples to P  being true. Namely, deﬁnea 
C  ::= {n ∈ N | P (n) is false} . 

•	 Assume for proof by contradiction that C  is nonempty. 

•	 By the Well Ordering Principle, there will be a smallest element, n, in C . 

•	 Reach  a  contradiction  (somehow) —often  by  showing  how  to  use  n  to  ﬁnd 
another member of C  that is smaller than n.  (This is the open-ended part of 
the proof task.) 

•	 Conclude that C must be empty, that is, no counterexamples exist. QED 

a The notation {n  | P (n)} means “the set of all elements n, for which P (n) is true.

The  proof  below  uses  the Well Ordering  Principle  to  prove  that  every  amount  of 
postage that can be paid exactly using only 6 cent and 15 cent stamps, is divisible 
by  3.  Let  the notation  “j  |  k”  indicate  that  integer  j  is  a divisor  of  integer  k ,  and 
let  S (n) mean  that  exactly  n  cents  postage  can  be  paid  using  only  6  and  15  cent 
stamps. Then the proof shows that

Let C  be the set of counterexamples to (*), namely1

Assume for the purpose of obtaining a contradiction that C is nonempty.

Next  suppose S (m − 15) holds.  Then  the proof  for m − 6 carries over

directly for m − 15 to yield a contradiction in this case as well. Since we

get a contradiction in both cases, we conclude that. . .

Problem 2.2. 
Euler ’s  Conjecture  in  1769  was  that  there  are  no  positive  integer  solutions  to  the 
equation 

a 4  + b4  + c 4  = d4 . 
Integer  values  for  a, b, c, d  that  do  satisfy  this  equation,  were  ﬁrst  discovered  in 
1986.  So Euler guessed wrong, but it took more two hundred years to prove it. 
Now let’s consider Lehman’s2  equation, similar to Euler ’s but with some coef­
ﬁcients: 

8a 4  + 4b4  + 2c 4  = d4

Problem 2.3. 
Use the Well Ordering Principle to prove that any integer greater than or equal to 
8 can be represented as the sum of integer multiples of 3 and 5. 

2.3  Summing the Integers 

Let’s use this this template to prove 

Theorem. 

· · · 
1 + 2 + 3 +  + n = n(n + 1)/2	

(2.2)

for all nonnegative integers, n. 

First, we better address of a couple of ambiguous special cases before they trip 
us up: 

· · ·
•	 If n = 1, then there is only one term in the summation, and so 1+ 2+ 3+ +n
is  just  the  term  1.  Don’t  be  misled  by  the  appearance  of  2  and  3  and  the 
suggestion that 1 and n are distinct terms! 
•	 If n ≤  0, then there are no terms at all in the summation.  By convention, the 
sum in this case is 0. 

So while  the dots notation  is  convenient,  you have  to watch  out  for  these  special 
cases where  the  notation  is misleading!  (In  fact, whenever  you  see  the  dots,  you 
should be on the lookout to be sure you understand the pattern, watching out for 
the beginning and the end.) 
We could have eliminated the need for guessing by rewriting the left side of (2.2) 
� 
� 
with summation notation: 
n
i. 
i 
1≤i≤n 
i=1 

or 

Both of  these expressions denote  the sum of all values  taken by  the expression  to 
the right of the sigma as the variable, i, ranges from 1 to n. Both expressions make 
it  clear what  (2.2) means when  n  = 1.  The  second  expression makes  it  clear  that 
when  n  = 0,  there  are  no  terms  in  the  sum,  though  you  still  have  to  know  the 
convention that a sum of no numbers equals 0 (the product of no numbers is 1, by 
the way). 
OK, back to the proof: 

2.4.  FACTORING INTO PRIMES

Proof.  By contradiction. Assume that the theorem is false. Then, some nonnegative

integers serve as counterexamples to it. Let’s collect them in a set: 
C  ::=  n ∈ N  | 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n =� n(n 
+ 1) 
.

By our assumption that the theorem admits counterexamples, C  is a nonempty set 
of  nonnegative  integers.  So,  by  the  Well  Ordering  Principle,  C  has  a  minimum 
element, call it c. That is, c is the smallest counterexample to the theorem. 
Since c is the smallest counterexample, we know that (2.2) is false for n = c but 
true  for all nonnegative  integers n < c.  But  (2.2)  is  true  for n  = 0,  so  c >  0.  This 
means c − 1 is a nonnegative integer, and since it is less than c, equation (2.2) is true 
for c − 1. That is, 
(c − 1)c

1 + 2 + 3 +  + (c − 1) =

.

1 + 2 + 3 +  + (c − 1) + c =

c2  − c + 2c  = 
(c − 1)c  + c = 
c(c + 1)

which means that (2.2) does hold for c, after all! This is a contradiction, and we are

2.4  Factoring into Primes 

(2.3)

We’ve previously taken for granted the Prime Factorization Theorem that every inte­
ger greater than one has a unique3  expression as a product of prime numbers. This 
is another of those familiar mathematical facts which are not really obvious. We’ll 
prove  the  uniqueness  of  prime  factorization  in  a  later  chapter,  but well  ordering 
gives  an  easy  proof  that  every  integer  greater  than  one  can  be  expressed  as  some 
product of primes. 

Theorem 2.4.1.  Every natural number can be factored as a product of primes.

CHAPTER 2.  THE WELL ORDERING PRINCIPLE 

Proof.  The proof is by Well Ordering. 
Let  C  be  the  set  of  all  integers  greater  than  one  that  cannot  be  factored  as  a 
product of primes. We assume C  is not empty and derive a contradiction. 
If C  is not empty, there is a least element, n ∈ C , by Well Ordering.  The n can’t 
be prime, because a prime by itself is considered a (length one) product of primes 
and no such products are in C . 
So n must be a product of two integers a and b where 1 < a, b < n. Since a and b 
are smaller than the smallest element in C , we know that a, b  /∈ C .  In other words, 
a  can  be  written  as  a  product  of  primes  p1p2  · · · pk  and  b  as  a  product  of  primes 
q1  · · · ql .  Therefore,  n  =  p1  · · · pk q1  · · · ql  can  be  written  as  a  product  of  primes, 
∅ must therefore be 
contradicting the claim that n  ∈ C .  Our assumption that C  =�
� 
false.
