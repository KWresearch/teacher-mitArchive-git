What is a Proof? 

1.1  Mathematical Proofs 

A proof is a method of establishing truth.  What constitutes a proof differs among 
ﬁelds. 

•	 Legal  truth  is  decided  by  a  jury  based  on  allowable  evidence  presented  at 
trial. 

•	 Authoritative truth is speciﬁed by a trusted person or organization. 

•	 Scientiﬁc truth1  is conﬁrmed by experiment. 

•	 Probable truth is established by statistical analysis of sample data. 

•	 Philosophical proof involves careful exposition and persuasion typically based 
on  a  series  of  small,  plausible  arguments.  The  best  example  begins  with 
“Cogito  ergo  sum,”  a  Latin  sentence  that  translates  as  “I  think,  therefore  I 
am.”  It comes from the beginning of a 17th century essay by the mathemati­
cian/philospher, Ren ´e Descartes, and it is one of the most famous quotes in 
the world: do a web search on the phrase and you will be ﬂooded with hits. 
Deducing your existence from the fact that you’re thinking about your exis­
tence  is  a  pretty  cool  and  persuasive-sounding  ﬁrst  axiom.  However,  with 
just a few more lines of argument in this vein, Descartes goes on to conclude 
that  there  is  an  inﬁnitely  beneﬁcent  God.  Whether  or  not  you  believe  in  a 
beneﬁcent God, you’ll probably agree that any very short proof of God’s ex­
istence is bound to be far-fetched.  So even in masterful hands, this approach 
is not reliable. 
1Actually,  only  scientiﬁc  falsehood  can  be  demonstrated  by  an  experiment —when  the  experiment 
fails to behave as predicted.  But no amount of experiment can conﬁrm that the next experiment won’t 
fail.  For  this  reason,  scientists  rarely  speak of  truth,  but  rather of  theories  that  accurately predict past, 
and anticipated future, experiments.

CHAPTER 1.  WHAT IS A PROOF? 

Mathematics also has a speciﬁc notion of “proof.” 

Deﬁnition.  A formal proof  of a proposition is a chain of logical deductions leading to 
the proposition from a base set of axioms. 

The  three  key  ideas  in  this deﬁnition  are  highlighted:  proposition,  logical de­
duction, and axiom.  In the next sections, we’ll discuss these three ideas along with 
some basic ways of organizing proofs. 

1.1.1  Problems

Problem 1.1. 
Identify exactly where the bugs are in each of the following bogus proofs.2 
(a)  Bogus Claim:  1/8 > 1/4. 

Bogus proof. 

3 > 2

3 log10 (1/2) > 2 log10 (1/2)

log10 (1/2)3  >  log10 (1/2)2

(1/2)3  > (1/2)2 ,


and the claim now follows by the rules for multiplying fractions. 

(b)  Bogus proof :  1¢ = $0.01 = ($0.1)2  = (10¢)2  = 100¢ = $1.  � 
(c)  Bogus Claim:  If a and b are two equal real numbers, then a = 0. 

Bogus proof. 

a  =  b

a 2  =  ab

a 2  − b2  =  ab − b2

(a − b)(a + b) = (a − b)b 
a + b  =  b 
a  = 0.

Problem 1.2. 
It’s a fact that the Arithmetic Mean is at least as large the Geometric Mean, namely, 
a + b  √

ab

for  all  nonnegative  real  numbers  a  and  b.  But  there’s  something  objectionable 
about  the  following proof  of  this  fact.  What’s  the  objection,  and  how would  you 
ﬁx it? 

Bogus proof.

a 2  − 2ab + b2  ≥ 0, 
? 
so 
(a − b)2  ≥ 0 
which we know is true. 
The last statement is true because a − b is a real number, and the square of a real

number is never negative. This proves the claim.

Problem 1.3. 
Albert announces that he plans a surprise 6.042 quiz next week. His students won­
der if the quiz could be next Friday.  The students realize that it obviously cannot, 
because if it hadn’t been given before Friday, everyone would know that there was 
only Friday left on which to give it, so it wouldn’t be a surprise any more. 
So  the  students  ask  whether  Albert  could  give  the  surprise  quiz  Thursday? 
They  observe  that  if  the  quiz  wasn’t  given  before  Thursday,  it  would  have  to  be 
given  on  the  Thursday,  since  they  already  know  it  can’t  be  given  on  Friday.  But 
having  ﬁgured  that  out,  it  wouldn’t  be  a  surprise  if  the  quiz  was  on  Thursday 
either. Similarly, the students reason that the quiz can’t be on Wednesday, Tuesday, 
or Monday.  Namely,  it’s  impossible  for Albert  to give  a  surprise quiz next week. 
All the students now relax, having concluded that Albert must have been blufﬁng. 
And since no one expects the quiz, that’s why, when Albert gives it on Tuesday 
next week, it really is a surprise! 
What do you think is wrong with the students’ reasoning? 

1.2  Propositions 

Deﬁnition.  A proposition is a statement that is either true or false. 

16 

CHAPTER 1.  WHAT IS A PROOF? 

This  deﬁnition  sounds  very  general,  but  it  does  exclude  sentences  such  as, 
“Wherefore art  thou Romeo?”  and “Give me an A!”.  But not all propositions are 
mathematical.  For example, “Albert’s wife’s name  is  ‘Irene’ ” happens  to be  true, 
and could be proved with legal documents and testimony of their children, but it’s 
not a mathematical statement. 
Mathematically  meaningful  propositions  must  be  about  well-deﬁned  mathe­
matical objects like numbers, sets, functions, relations, etc., and they must be stated 
using mathematically precise language. We can illustrate this with a few examples. 
Proposition 1.2.1.  2 + 3 = 5. 

This proposition is true. 
A prime is an integer greater than one that is not divisible by any integer greater 
than 1 besides itself, for example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, . . . . 
Proposition 1.2.2.  For every nonnegative integer, n, the value of n2  + n + 41 is prime. 
Let’s try some numerical experimentation to check this proposition. Let 3 

p(n) ::= n 2  + n + 41. 

(1.1) 

We  begin  with  p(0)  =  41  which  is  prime.  p(1)  =  43  which  is  prime.  p(2)  =  47 
which is prime.  p(3) = 53 which is prime.  . . . p(20) = 461 which is prime. Hmmm, 
starts  to  look  like a plausible claim.  In fact we can keep checking  through n  =  39 
and conﬁrm that p(39) = 1601 is prime. 
· 
But p(40) = 402  + 40 + 41 = 41  41, which is not prime.  So it’s not true that the 
expression  is prime  for all nonnegative  integers.  In fact,  it’s not hard to show that 
no nonconstant polynomial with  integer coefﬁcients can map all natural numbers 
into prime numbers.  The point is that in general you can’t check a claim about an 
inﬁnite  set  by  checking  a  ﬁnite  set  of  its  elements,  no matter  how  large  the  ﬁnite 
set. 
By the way, propositions like this about all numbers or other things are so com­
mon  that  there  is  a  special  notation  for  it.  With  this  notation,  Proposition  1.2.2 
would be 
∀n ∈ N. p(n) is prime. 
(1.2) 
Here the symbol ∀ is read “for all”.  The symbol N stands for the set of nonnegative 
integers, namely,  0,  1,  2,  3,  . . . (ask your TA  for  the complete  list).  The symbol “∈ ” 
is  read  as  “is  a member  of ”  or  simply  as  “is  in”.  The  period  after  the  N  is  just  a 
separator between phrases. 
Here are two even more extreme examples: 
Proposition 1.2.3.  a4 + b4 + c4  = d4  has no solution when a, b, c, d are positive integers. 

Euler  (pronounced  “oiler ”)  conjectured  this  in  1769.  But  the  proposition was 
proven  false 218 years  later by Noam Elkies at  a  liberal arts  school up Mass Ave. 
The solution he found was a = 95800, b = 217519, c = 414560, d = 422481. 
3 The symbol ::= means “equal by deﬁnition.”  It’s always ok to simply write “=” instead of ::=, but 
reminding the reader that an equality holds by deﬁnition can be helpful. 

1.2.  PROPOSITIONS 

17 

In logical notation, Proposition 1.2.3 could be written, 
∀a ∈ Z+ ∀b ∈ Z+ ∀c ∈ Z+ ∀d ∈ Z+ 4  + b4  + c 4  = d4 
. a 
. 
Here,  Z+  is  a  symbol  for  the  positive  integers.  Strings  of  ∀’s  like  this  are usually 
abbreviated for easier reading: 
∀a, b, c, d ∈ Z+ . a 4  + b4  + c 4  =�
d4 . 
Proposition 1.2.4.  313(x3  + y3 ) = z 3  has no solution when x, y , z  ∈ Z+ . 
This  proposition  is  also  false,  but  the  smallest  counterexample  has more  than 
1000 digits! 
Proposition 1.2.5.  Every map can be colored with 4 colors so that adjacent4  regions have 
different colors. 
This  proposition  is  true  and  is  known  as  the  “Four-Color  Theorem”.  However, 
there have been many incorrect proofs, including one that stood for 10 years in the 
late 19th century before the mistake was found. An extremely laborious proof was 
ﬁnally  found  in  1976 by mathematicians Appel  and Haken, who used  a  complex 
computer program to categorize the four-colorable maps; the program left a couple 
of thousand maps uncategorized, and these were checked by hand by Haken and 
his assistants—including his 15-year-old daughter. There was a lot of debate about 
whether this was a legitimate proof:  the proof was too big to be checked without a 
computer, and no one could guarantee that the computer calculated correctly, nor 
did  anyone  have  the  energy  to  recheck  the  four-colorings  of  thousands  of  maps 
that were done by hand.  Finally,  about ﬁve years  ago,  a mostly  intelligible proof 
of the Four-Color Theorem was found, though a computer is still needed to check 
colorability of several hundred special maps (see 
http://www.math.gatech.edu/˜thomas/FC/fourcolor.html).  5 
Proposition  1.2.6  (Goldbach).  Every  even  integer  greater  than  2  is  the  sum  of  two 
primes. 
No one knows whether this proposition is true or false.  It is known as Goldbach’s 
Conjecture, and dates back to 1742. 
For  a  computer  scientist,  some  of  the most  important  things  to  prove  are  the 
“correctness”  programs  and  systems —whether  a  program  or  system  does  what 
it’s supposed to.  Programs are notoriously buggy, and there’s a growing commu­
nity of researchers and practitioners trying to ﬁnd ways to prove program correct­
ness. These efforts have been successful enough in the case of CPU chips that they 
are  now  routinely  used  by  leading  chip manufacturers  to  prove  chip  correctness 
and avoid mistakes like the notorious Intel division bug in the 1990’s. 
Developing mathematical methods to verify programs and systems remains an 
active research area. We’ll consider some of these methods later in the course. 
4 Two  regions  are  adjacent  only when  they  share  a  boundary  segment  of positive  length.  They  are 
not considered to be adjacent if their boundaries meet only at a few points.

Colors Sufﬁce.  How the Map Problem was Solved.”  Robin Wilson.  Princeton Univ.  Press, 2003, 276pp.

CHAPTER 1.  WHAT IS A PROOF? 

1.3  Predicates 

A predicate is a proposition whose truth depends on the value of one or more vari­
ables.  Most  of  the  propostions  above  were  deﬁned  in  terms  of  predicates.  For 
example, 

“n is a perfect square” 

is  a  predicate  whose  truth  depends  on  the  value  of  n.  The  predicate  is  true  for 
n  = 4  since  four  is  a perfect  square,  but  false  for n  = 5  since ﬁve  is not  a perfect 
square. 
Like other propositions, predicates are often named with a letter.  Furthermore, 
a  function-like notation  is used  to denote  a predicate  supplied with  speciﬁc vari­
able values.  For example, we might name our earlier predicate P : 

P (n) ::= “n is a perfect square” 

Now P (4) is true, and P (5) is false. 
This  notation  for  predicates  is  confusingly  similar  to  ordinary  function  nota­
tion.  If  P  is  a  predicate,  then  P (n)  is  either  true  or  false,  depending  on  the  value 
of  n.  On  the  other  hand,  if  p  is  an  ordinary  function,  like  n2  + 1,  then  p(n)  is  a 
numerical quantity. Don’t confuse these two! 

1.4  The Axiomatic Method 

The standard procedure for establishing truth in mathematics was invented by Eu­
clid, a mathematician working in Alexandria, Egypt around 300 BC. His idea was 
to begin with ﬁve assumptions about geometry, which seemed undeniable based on 
direct  experience.  (For  example,  “There  is  a  straight  line  segment  between  every 
pair of points.)  Propositions  like  these  that are simply accepted as  true are called 
axioms. 
Starting  from  these  axioms,  Euclid  established  the  truth  of  many  additional 
propositions  by  providing  “proofs”.  A  proof  is  a  sequence  of  logical  deductions 
from  axioms  and  previously-proved  statements  that  concludes with  the  proposi­
tion  in question.  You probably wrote many proofs  in high school geometry class, 
and you’ll see a lot more in this course. 
There  are  several  common  terms  for  a proposition  that  has  been proved.  The 
different terms hint at the role of the proposition within a larger body of work. 

•	 Important propositions are called theorems. 

•	 A lemma is a preliminary proposition useful for proving later propositions. 

•	 A  corollary  is  a  proposition  that  follows  in  just  a  few  logical  steps  from  a 
theorem. 

1.5.  OUR AXIOMS 

19 

The deﬁnitions  are  not  precise.  In  fact,  sometimes  a  good  lemma  turns  out  to  be 
far more important than the theorem it was originally used to prove. 
Euclid’s  axiom-and-proof  approach,  now  called  the  axiomatic  method,  is  the 
foundation  for  mathematics  today.  In  fact,  just  a  handful  of  axioms,  called  the 
axioms Zermelo-Frankel with Choice (ZFC), together with a few logical deduction 
rules, appear to be sufﬁcient to derive essentially all of mathematics. We’ll examine 
these in Chapter 4. 

1.5  Our Axioms 

The ZFC axioms are important in studying and justifying the foundations of math­
ematics, but for practical purposes, they are much too primitive. Proving theorems 
in ZFC  is a  little  like writing programs  in byte  code  instead of a  full-ﬂedged pro­
gramming  language  —by  one  reckoning,  a  formal  proof  in  ZFC  that  2 + 2  =  4 
requires more  than  20,000  steps!  So  instead  of  starting with  ZFC, we’re  going  to 
take a huge set of axioms as our foundation: we’ll accept all familiar facts from high 
school math! 
This will give us a quick launch, but you may ﬁnd this imprecise speciﬁcation 
of  the  axioms  troubling  at  times.  For  example,  in  the midst  of  a  proof,  you may 
ﬁnd yourself wondering, “Must I prove this little fact or can I take it as an axiom?” 
Feel  free  to  ask  for  guidance,  but  really  there  is  no  absolute  answer.  Just  be  up 
front  about  what  you’re  assuming,  and  don’t  try  to  evade  homework  and  exam 
problems by declaring everything an axiom! 

1.5.1  Logical Deductions 
Logical deductions or inference rules are used to prove new propositions using pre­
viously proved ones. 
A fundamental inference rule is modus ponens.  This rule says that a proof of P 
together with a proof that P  IM P L I E S Q is a proof of Q. 
Inference rules are sometimes written in a funny notation.  For example, modus 
ponens is written: 

Rule. 

P ,  P  IM P L I E S Q

Q


When the statements above the line, called the antecedents, are proved, then we 
can  consider  the  statement  below  the  line,  called  the  conclusion  or  consequent,  to 
also be proved. 
A key requirement of an inference rule is that it must be sound:  any assignment 
of truth values that makes all the antecedents true must also make the consequent 
true.  So  if we  start  off with  true  axioms  and  apply  sound  inference  rules,  every­
thing we prove will also be true. 
There are many other natural, sound inference rules, for example: 

20

CHAPTER 1.  WHAT IS A PROOF? 

P  IM P L I E S Q,  Q IM P L I E S R 
P  IM P L I E S R 

NO T(P ) IM P L I E S  NOT(Q) 
Q IM P L I E S P 

NO T(P ) IM P L I E S  NOT(Q) 
P  IM P L I E S Q 

is  not  sound:  if P  is  assigned T  and Q  is  assigned F,  then  the  antecedent  is  true 
and the consequent is not. 
Note  that  a  propositional  inference  rule  is  sound  precisely when  the  conjunc­
tion (AND) of all its antecedents implies its consequent. 
As with axioms, we will not be too formal about the set of legal inference rules. 
Each step  in a proof should be clear and “logical”;  in particular, you should state 
what previously proved facts are used to derive each new conclusion. 

1.5.2  Patterns of Proof 

In  principle,  a  proof  can  be  any  sequence  of  logical  deductions  from  axioms  and 
previously  proved  statements  that  concludes  with  the  proposition  in  question. 
This  freedom  in  constructing  a  proof  can  seem  overwhelming  at  ﬁrst.  How  do 
you even start a proof? 
Here’s  the good news:  many proofs  follow one of  a handful of  standard  tem­
plates. Each proof has it own details, of course, but these templates at least provide 
you with an outline to ﬁll in.  We’ll go through several of these standard patterns, 
pointing out the basic idea and common pitfalls and giving some examples. Many 
of  these  templates ﬁt  together;  one may give you a  top-level outline while others 
help you at the next level of detail.  And we’ll show you other, more sophisticated 
proof techniques later on. 
The recipes below are very speciﬁc at times, telling you exactly which words to 
write down  on  your piece  of paper.  You’re  certainly  free  to  say  things  your  own 
way instead; we’re just giving you something you could say so that you’re never at 
a complete loss. 

1.6  Proving an Implication 

Propositions of  the  form “If P ,  then Q” are called  implications.  This  implication  is 
often rephrased as “P  IM P L I E S Q.” 
Here are some examples: 

21

, then 
b2  − 4ac  /2a. 
x =  −b ± 
•	 (Goldbach’s Conjecture) If n is an even integer greater than 2, then n is a sum 
of two primes. 
•	 If 0 ≤ x ≤ 2, then −x3  + 4x + 1 > 0. 
There are a couple of standard methods for proving an implication. 

1.6.1  Method #1 
In order to prove that P  IM P L I E S Q: 
1.  Write, “Assume P .” 

2.  Show that Q logically follows. 

Example 
Theorem 1.6.1.  If 0 ≤ x ≤ 2, then −x3  + 4x + 1 > 0. 
Before  we  write  a  proof  of  this  theorem,  we  have  to  do  some  scratchwork  to 
ﬁgure out why it is true. 
The  inequality  certainly  holds  for  x  = 0;  then  the  left  side  is  equal  to  1  and 
1  >  0.  As x grows,  the 4x  term  (which  is positive)  initially seems  to have greater 
magnitude  than  −x3  (which  is  negative).  For  example,  when  x  = 1,  we  have 
4x  = 4,  but −x3  =  −1  only.  In  fact,  it  looks  like −x3  doesn’t  begin  to  dominate 
until x > 2.  So it seems the −x3  + 4x part should be nonnegative for all x between 
0 and 2, which would imply that −x3  + 4x + 1 is positive. 
So far, so good.  But we still have to replace all those “seems like” phrases with 
solid,  logical arguments.  We can get a better handle on  the critical −x3  + 4x part 
by factoring it, which is not too hard: 
−x 3  + 4x = x(2 − x)(2 + x) 
Aha! For x between 0 and 2, all of the terms on the right side are nonnegative. And 
a product of nonnegative terms is also nonnegative. Let’s organize this blizzard of 
observations into a clean proof. 
Proof.  Assume 0 ≤ x ≤ 2.  Then x, 2 − x, and 2 + x are all nonnegative.  Therefore, 
the  product  of  these  terms  is  also  nonnegative.  Adding  1  to  this  product  gives  a 
positive number, so: 
x(2 − x)(2 + x) + 1 > 0 
Multiplying out on the left side proves that 
−x 3  + 4x + 1 > 0 

as claimed.

22	

CHAPTER 1.  WHAT IS A PROOF? 

There are a couple points here that apply to all proofs: 

•	 You’ll  often  need  to  do  some  scratchwork while  you’re  trying  to  ﬁgure  out 
the logical steps of a proof.  Your scratchwork can be as disorganized as you 
like—  full  of  dead-ends,  strange  diagrams,  obscene  words,  whatever.  But 
keep your scratchwork separate from your ﬁnal proof, which should be clear 
and concise. 

•	 Proofs  typically  begin  with  the  word  “Proof ”  and  end  with  some  sort  of 
doohickey  like  �  or  “q.e.d”.  The  only  purpose  for  these  conventions  is  to 
clarify where proofs begin and end. 

1.6.2  Method #2 - Prove the Contrapositive 
An implication (“P  IM P L I E S Q”) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive 

NOT(Q) IM P L I E S  NOT(P ) 

Proving  one  is  as  good  as  proving  the  other,  and  proving  the  contrapositive  is 
sometimes easier than proving the original statement.  If so, then you can proceed 
as follows: 

1.  Write, “We prove the contrapositive:”  and then state the contrapositive. 

2.  Proceed as in Method #1. 

Example

√
Theorem 1.6.2.  If r is irrational, then 
r is also irrational.


√
Recall that rational numbers are equal to a ratio of integers and irrational num­
r is also not 
bers are not.  So we must show that if r is not a ratio of integers, then 
a ratio of integers. That’s pretty convoluted! We can eliminate both not’s and make 
the proof straightforward by considering the contrapositive instead.

Proof.  We prove the contrapositive:  if 
r is rational, then r is rational.

Use  whatever  familiar  facts  about  integers  and  primes  you  need,  but  explicitly 
state such facts.  (This problem will be graded on the clarity and simplicity of your 
proof.  If you can’t ﬁgure out how to prove it, ask the staff for help and they’ll tell 
you how.) 

1.7  Proving an “If and Only If” 

Many mathematical  theorems assert  that  two  statements are  logically equivalent; 
that  is,  one holds  if  and  only  if  the  other does.  Here  is  an  example  that has  been 
known for several thousand years: 

Two triangles have the same side lengths if and only if two side lengths 
and the angle between those sides are the same. 

The phrase “if and only if ” comes up so often that it is often abbreviated “iff ”. 

1.7.1  Method #1: Prove Each Statement Implies the Other 
The  statement  “P  I FF  Q”  is  equivalent  to  the  two  statements  “P  IM P L I E S  Q”  and 
“Q IM P L I E S P ”.  So you can prove an “iff ” by proving two implications: 

1.  Write, “We prove P  implies Q and vice-versa.” 

2.  Write, “First, we show P  implies Q.”  Do  this by one of  the methods  in Sec­
tion 1.6. 

3.  Write,  “Now, we show Q  implies P .”  Again, do  this by one of  the methods 
in Section 1.6. 

1.7.2  Method #2: Construct a Chain of Iffs 
In order to prove that P  is true iff Q is true: 

1.  Write, “We construct a chain of if-and-only-if implications.” 

2.  Prove  P  is  equivalent  to  a  second  statement  which  is  equivalent  to  a  third 
statement and so forth until you reach Q. 

This method  sometimes  requires more  ingenuity  than  the ﬁrst,  but  the  result  can 
be a short, elegant proof.

� 
The standard deviation of a sequence of values x1 , x2 , . . . , xn  is deﬁned to be: 
(x1  − µ)2  + (x2  − µ)2  + · · · + (xn  − µ)2 
n 

(1.3) 

where µ is the mean of the values: 

µ ::= 

x1  + x2  + · · · + xn 
n 

Theorem  1.7.1.  The  standard  deviation  of  a  sequence  of  values x1 , . . . , xn  is  zero  iff  all 
the values are equal to the mean. 

For example, the standard deviation of test scores is zero if and only if everyone 
scored exactly the class average. 
Proof.  We  construct  a  chain  of  “iff ”  implications,  starting with  the  statement  that 
� 
the standard deviation (1.3) is zero: 
(x1  − µ)2  + (x2  − µ)2  + · · · + (xn  − µ)2 
n 

(1.4) 

= 0. 

Now since zero is the only number whose square root is zero, equation (1.4) holds 
iff 
(x1  − µ)2  + (x2  − µ)2  +  + (xn  − µ)2  = 0. 
· · · 
(1.5)
Now  squares  of  real  numbers  are  always  nonnegative,  so  every  term  on  the  left 
hand side of equation (1.5) is nonnegative. This means that (1.5) holds iff 

Every term on the left hand side of (1.5) is zero. 
But a term (xi  − µ)2  is zero iff xi  = µ, so (1.6) is true iff 

Every xi  equals the mean.

1.8  Proof by Cases 

Breaking a complicated proof into cases and proving each case separately is a use­
ful, common proof strategy. Here’s an amusing example. 
Let’s agree that given any two people, either they have met or not.  If every pair 
of people in a group has met, we’ll call the group a club.  If every pair of people in 
a group has not met, we’ll call it a group of strangers. 

Theorem.  Every collection of 6 people includes a club of 3 people or a group of 3 strangers. 

1.8.  PROOF BY CASES 

25 

Proof.  The proof is by case analysis6 .  Let x denote one of the six people.  There are 
two cases: 

1.  Among 5 other people besides x, at least 3 have met x. 

2.  Among the 5 other people, at least 3 have not met x. 

Now  we  have  to  be  sure  that  at  least  one  of  these  two  cases  must  hold,7  but 
that’s easy: we’ve split the 5 people into two groups, those who have shaken hands 
with  x  and  those  who  have  not,  so  one  the  groups  must  have  at  least  half  the 
people. 
Case 1:  Suppose that at least 3 people did meet x.

This case splits into two subcases:


Case 1.1: No pair among those people met each other.  Then these peo­
ple  are  a  group  of  at  least  3  strangers.  So  the  Theorem  holds  in  this 
subcase. 
Case  1.2:  Some  pair  among  those  people  have  met  each  other.  Then 
that  pair,  together  with  x,  form  a  club  of  3  people.  So  the  Theorem 
holds in this subcase. 

This implies that the Theorem holds in Case 1. 
Case 2:  Suppose that at least 3 people did not meet x. 
This case also splits into two subcases: 

Case  2.1:  Every  pair  among  those  people met  each  other.  Then  these 
people  are  a  club  of  at  least  3  people.  So  the  Theorem  holds  in  this 
subcase. 
Case 2.2: Some pair among those people have not met each other. Then 
that pair,  together with  x,  form  a  group  of  at  least  3  strangers.  So  the 
Theorem holds in this subcase. 

This implies that the Theorem also holds in Case 2, and therefore holds in all cases.

Problem 1.6. 
For  n  =  40,  the  value  of  polynomial  p(n)  ::= n2  + n + 41  is  not  prime,  as  noted 
in  Chapter  1  of  the  Course  Text.  But  we  could  have  predicted  based  on  general 
principles that no nonconstant polynomial, q(n), with integer coefﬁcients can map 
each nonnegative integer into a prime number. Prove it. 
Hint:  Let  c  ::=  q(0)  be  the  constant  term  of  q .  Consider  two  cases:  c  is  not 
prime,  and c  is prime.  In  the second case, note  that q(cn)  is a multiple of c  for all 
n  ∈  Z.  You may  assume  the  familiar  fact  that  the magnitude  (absolute  value)  of 
any nonconstant polynomial, q(n), grows unboundedly as n grows. 

1.9  Proof by Contradiction 

In a proof by contradiction or indirect proof, you show that if a proposition were false, 
then some false fact would be true.  Since a false fact can’t be true, the proposition 
had better not be false. That is, the proposition really must be true. 
Proof by contradiction is always a viable approach.  However, as the name sug­
gests,  indirect  proofs  can  be  a  little  convoluted.  So  direct  proofs  are  generally 
preferable as a matter of clarity. 
Method:  In order to prove a proposition P  by contradiction: 

1.  Write, “We use proof by contradiction.” 

2.  Write, “Suppose P  is false.” 

3.  Deduce something known to be false (a logical contradiction). 

4.  Write, “This is a contradiction. Therefore, P  must be true.”

This  italicized  comment on  the  implication of  the  contradic­
tion normally  goes without  saying,  but  since  this  is  the ﬁrst 
6.042 exercise about proof by contradiction, we’ve said it. 

To prove that n and d have 2 as a common factor, we start by squaring 
both sides of (1.7) and get 2 = n2 /d2 , so 

2d2  = n 2 . 

(1.8) 

So 2 is a factor of n2 , which is only possible if 2 is in fact a factor of n. 
This means that n = 2k for some integer, k , so 

n 2  = (2k)2  = 4k2 . 

Combining (1.8) and (1.9) gives 2d2  = 4k2 , so 

d2  = 2k2 . 

(1.9) 

(1.10) 

So  2 is  a factor of  d2 , which  again  is  only  possible  if  2  is  in  fact  also  a

1.10  Good Proofs in Practice 

One purpose of a proof  is  to  establish  the  truth of an assertion with absolute  cer­
tainty.  Mechanically  checkable  proofs  of  enormous  length  or  complexity  can  ac­
complish this. But humanly intelligible proofs are the only ones that help someone 
understand the subject. Mathematicians generally agree that important mathemat­
ical results can’t be fully understood until their proofs are understood. That is why 
proofs are an important part of the curriculum. 
To be understandable and helpful, more is required of a proof than just logical 
correctness:  a  good  proof must  also  be  clear.  Correctness  and  clarity  usually  go 
together;  a well-written  proof  is more  likely  to  be  a  correct  proof,  since mistakes 
are harder to hide. 
In  practice,  the  notion  of  proof  is  a  moving  target.  Proofs  in  a  professional 
research  journal  are  generally  unintelligible  to  all  but  a  few  experts  who  know 
all  the  terminology  and prior  results used  in  the proof.  Conversely,  proofs  in  the 
ﬁrst weeks of a beginning course  like 6.042 would be regarded as  tediously  long-
winded by a professional mathematician.  In fact, what we accept as a good proof 
later  in  the  term will  be  different  from what we  consider  good  proofs  in  the  ﬁrst 
couple of weeks of  6.042.  But  even  so, we  can offer  some general  tips on writing 
good proofs: 

State your game plan.  A good proof begins by explaining the general line of rea­
soning, for example, “We use case analysis” or “We argue by contradiction.” 

Keep a linear ﬂow.  Sometimes proofs are written like mathematical mosaics, with 
juicy  tidbits  of  independent  reasoning  sprinkled  throughout.  This  is  not 
good.  The  steps  of  an  argument  should  follow  one  another  in  an  intellig­
ble order. 

A proof is an essay, not a calculation.  Many students initially write proofs the way 
they compute integrals. The result is a long sequence of expressions without 
explanation, making it very hard to follow. This is bad. A good proof usually 
looks like an essay with some equations thrown in. Use complete sentences. 

Avoid excessive symbolism.  Your reader is probably good at understanding words, 
but much less skilled at reading arcane mathematical symbols.  So use words 
where you reasonably can. 

Revise and simplify.  Your readers will be grateful. 

Introduce notation thoughtfully.  Sometimes  an  argument  can  be  greatly  simpli­
ﬁed by introducing a variable, devising a special notation, or deﬁning a new 
term. But do this sparingly since you’re requiring the reader to remember all 
that  new  stuff.  And  remember  to  actually  deﬁne  the meanings  of  new  vari­
ables, terms, or notations; don’t just start using them! 

Structure long proofs.  Long programs are usually broken into a hierarchy of smaller 
procedures. Long proofs are much the same. Facts needed in your proof that 

30 

CHAPTER 1.  WHAT IS A PROOF? 

are  easily  stated,  but  not  readily  proved  are  best  pulled  out  and  proved  in 
preliminary  lemmas.  Also,  if  you  are  repeating  essentially  the  same  argu­
ment over and over, try to capture that argument in a general lemma, which 
you can cite repeatedly instead. 

Be wary of the “obvious”.  When  familiar  or  truly  obvious  facts  are  needed  in  a 
proof,  it’s OK  to  label  them  as  such  and  to  not  prove  them.  But  remember 
that what’s  obvious  to  you, may  not  be —and  typically  is  not —obvious  to 
your reader. 
Most especially, don’t use phrases like “clearly” or “obviously” in an attempt 
to bully the reader into accepting something you’re having trouble proving. 
Also, go on the alert whenever you see one of these phrases in someone else’s 
proof. 

Finish.  At  some  point  in  a  proof,  you’ll  have  established  all  the  essential  facts 
you  need.  Resist  the  temptation  to  quit  and  leave  the  reader  to  draw  the 
“obvious” conclusion.  Instead,  tie everything  together yourself and explain 
why the original claim follows. 

The  analogy  between  good  proofs  and  good  programs  extends  beyond  struc­
ture.  The  same  rigorous  thinking  needed  for  proofs  is  essential  in  the  design  of 
critical  computer  systems.  When  algorithms  and  protocols  only  “mostly  work” 
due  to  reliance  on  hand-waving  arguments,  the  results  can  range  from  problem­
atic to catastrophic. An early example was the Therac 25, a machine that provided 
radiation  therapy  to  cancer  victims,  but  occasionally  killed  them  with  massive 
overdoses  due  to  a  software  race  condition.  A more  recent  (August  2004)  exam­
ple  involved  a  single  faulty  command  to  a  computer  system used by United  and 
American Airlines that grounded the entire ﬂeet of both companies— and all their 
passengers! 
It  is a  certainty  that we’ll all one day be at  the mercy of  critical  computer  sys­
tems designed by you and your classmates.  So we really hope that you’ll develop 
the  ability  to  formulate  rock-solid  logical  arguments  that  a  system  actually  does 
what you think it does!
