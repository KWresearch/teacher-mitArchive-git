Problem 1. 
The proof below uses the Well Ordering Principle to prove that every amount of postage that can 
be  paid  exactly  using  only  6  cent  and  15  cent  stamps,  is  divisible  by  3.  Let  the  notation  “j  |  k” 
indicate that integer j  is a divisor of integer k , and let S (n) mean that exactly n cents postage can 
be paid using only 6 and 15 cent stamps. Then the proof shows that 
S (n)  IM P L I E S  3 | n, 

for all nonnegative integers n. 

(*) 

Fill in the missing portions (indicated by “. . . ”)  of the following proof of (*). 

Let C  be the set of counterexamples to (*), namely1 

C  ::= {n  | . . . } 

Assume for the purpose of obtaining a contradiction that C  is nonempty.  Then by the 
WOP, there is a smallest number, m ∈ C . This m must be positive because. . . . 
But if S (m) holds and m is positive, then S (m − 6) or S (m − 15) must hold, because. . . . 
So suppose S (m − 6) holds. Then 3 | (m − 6), because. . . 
But if 3 | (m − 6), then obviously 3 | m, contradicting the fact that m is a counterexam­
ple. 
Next suppose S (m − 15) holds. Then the proof for m − 6 carries over directly for m − 15 
to yield a contradiction in this case as well.  Since we get a contradiction in both cases, 
we conclude that. . . 
which proves that (*) holds.

Problem 3. 
Euler ’s Conjecture in 1769 was that there are no positive integer solutions to the equation 

a 4  + b4  + c 4  = d4 . 

Integer  values  for  a, b, c, d  that  do  satisfy  this  equation,  were  ﬁrst  discovered  in  1986.  So  Euler 
guessed wrong, but it took more two hundred years to prove it. 
Now let’s consider Lehman’s2  equation, similar to Euler ’s but with some coefﬁcients: 

8a 4  + 4b4  + 2c 4  = d4 

(2) 

Prove that Lehman’s equation (2) really does not have any positive integer solutions. 
Hint: Consider the minimum value of a among all possible solutions to (2).
