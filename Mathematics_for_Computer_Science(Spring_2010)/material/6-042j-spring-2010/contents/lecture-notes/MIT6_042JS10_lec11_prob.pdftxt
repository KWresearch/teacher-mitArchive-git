Problem 1. 
The table below lists some prerequisite information for some subjects in the MIT Computer Science 
program (in 2006).  This deﬁnes an indirect prerequisite relation, �, that is a strict partial order on 
these subjects.

(a)  Explain why exactly six terms are required to ﬁnish all these subjects, if you can take as many 
subjects as you want per term.  Using a greedy subject selection strategy, you should take as many 
subjects  as  possible  each  term.  Exhibit  your  complete  class  schedule  each  term  using  a  greedy 
strategy. 

(b)  In the second term of the greedy schedule, you took ﬁve subjects  including 18.03.  Identify a 
set of ﬁve subjects not including 18.03 such that it would be possible to take them in any one term 
(using some nongreedy schedule). Can you ﬁgure out how many such sets there are? 

(c)  Exhibit a schedule for taking all the courses —but only one per term. 

(d)  Suppose that you want to take all of the subjects, but can handle only two per term.  Exactly 
how many terms are required to graduate? Explain why. 

(e)  What if you could take three subjects per term? 

Problem 2. 
A  pair  of  6.042  TAs,  Liz  and  Oscar,  have  decided  to  devote  some  of  their  spare  time  this  term 
to  establishing  dominion  over  the  entire  galaxy.  Recognizing  this  as  an  ambitious  project,  they 
worked out the following table of tasks on the back of Oscar ’s copy of the lecture notes. 

1.	 Devise a logo and cool imperial theme music - 8 days. 

2.	 Build a ﬂeet of Hyperwarp Stardestroyers out of eating paraphernalia swiped from Lobdell 
- 18 days.

3.	 Seize control of the United Nations - 9 days, after task #1. 

4.	 Get shots for Liz’s cat, Tailspin - 11 days, after task #1. 

5.	 Open a Starbucks chain for the army to get their caffeine - 10 days, after task #3. 

6.	 Train  an  army  of  elite  interstellar warriors  by  dragging  people  to  see  The  Phantom Menace 
dozens of times - 4 days, after tasks #3, #4, and #5. 

7.	 Launch  the ﬂeet  of  Stardestroyers,  crush  all  sentient  alien  species,  and  establish  a Galactic 
Empire - 6 days, after tasks #2 and #6. 

8.	 Defeat Microsoft - 8 days, after tasks #2 and #6. 

We  picture  this  information  in  Figure  1  below  by  drawing  a  point  for  each  task,  and  labelling  it 
with the name and weight of the task.  An edge between two points indicates that the task for the 
higher point must be completed before beginning the task for the lower one.

Figure 1: Graph representing the task precedence constraints. 

(a)  Give some valid order in which the tasks might be completed. 

Liz and Oscar want to complete all these tasks in the shortest possible time.  However, they have 
agreed on some constraining work rules. 

•	 Only one person can be assigned to a particular task; they can not work together on a single 
task.

•	 Once  a  person  is  assigned  to  a  task,  that  person must work  exclusively  on  the  assignment 
until it is completed. So, for example, Liz cannot work on building a ﬂeet for a few days, run 
to get shots for Tailspin, and then return to building the ﬂeet. 

(b)  Liz  and Oscar want  to  know  how  long  conquering  the  galaxy will  take.  Oscar  suggests  di­
viding  the  total  number  of  days  of work  by  the  number  of workers,  which  is  two.  What  lower 
bound on the time to conquer the galaxy does this give, and why might the actual time required 
be greater? 

(c)  Liz  proposes  a  different method  for  determining  the  duration  of  their  project.  He  suggests 
looking  at  the  duration  of  the  “critical  path”,  the  most  time-consuming  sequence  of  tasks  such 
that each depends on the one before.  What lower bound does this give, and why might it also be 
too low? 

(d)  What  is  the minimum  number  of  days  that  Liz  and Oscar  need  to  conquer  the  galaxy?  No 
proof is required. 

Problem 3.  (a)  What are the maximal and minimal elements, if any, of the power set P ({1, . . . , n}), 
where n is a positive integer, under the empty relation? 
(b)  What are the maximal and minimal elements, if any, of the set, N, of all nonnegative integers 
under divisibility?  Is there a minimum or maximum element? 

(c)  What are the minimal and maximal elements, if any, of the set of integers greater than 1 under 
divisibility? 

(d)  Describe a partially ordered set that has no minimal or maximal elements. 

(e)  Describe a partially ordered set that has a unique minimal element, but no minimum element. 
Hint:  It will have to be inﬁnite.
