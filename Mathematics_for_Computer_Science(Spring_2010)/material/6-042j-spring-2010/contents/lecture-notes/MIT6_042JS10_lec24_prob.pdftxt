Problem 1. 
An  explorer  is  trying  to  reach  the  Holy  Grail,  which  she  believes  is  located  in  a  desert  shrine  d 
days walk  from  the  nearest  oasis.  In  the  desert  heat,  the  explorer must  drink  continuously.  She 
can  carry  at  most  1  gallon  of  water,  which  is  enough  for  1  day.  However,  she  is  free  to  make 
multiple trips carrying up to a gallon each time to create water caches out in the desert. 
For  example,  if  the  shrine  were  2/3  of  a  day’s  walk  into  the  desert,  then  she  could  recover  the 
Holy Grail after two days using the following strategy.  She leaves the oasis with 1 gallon of water, 
travels 1/3 day into the desert, caches 1/3 gallon, and then walks back to the oasis— arriving just 
as her water  supply  runs out.  Then  she picks up  another gallon of water  at  the oasis, walks  1/3 
day  into  the  desert,  tops  off  her  water  supply  by  taking  the  1/3  gallon  in  her  cache,  walks  the 
remaining 1/3 day to the shrine, grabs the Holy Grail, and then walks for 2/3 of a day back to the 
oasis— again arriving with no water to spare. 
But what if the shrine were located farther away? 

(a)  What  is  the most distant point  that  the explorer can reach and  then return  to  the oasis  if she 
takes a total of only 1 gallon from the oasis? 

(b)  What is the most distant point the explorer can reach and still return to the oasis if she takes 
a total of only 2 gallons from the oasis? No proof is required; just do the best you can. 

(c)  The explorer will travel using a recursive strategy to go far into the desert and back drawing 
a  total  of n  gallons  of water  from  the  oasis.  Her  strategy  is  to  build up  a  cache  of n − 1  gallons, 
plus enough to get home, a certain fraction of a day’s distance into the desert. On the last delivery 
to the cache, instead of returning home, she proceeds recursively with her n − 1 gallon strategy to 
go  farther  into  the desert and  return  to  the cache.  At  this point,  the cache has  just enough water 
left to get her home. 
Prove  that with n gallons of water,  this strategy will get her Hn/2 days  into  the desert and back, 
where Hn  is the nth Harmonic number:

Conclude that she can reach the shrine, however far it is from the oasis. 

(d)  Suppose that the shrine is d = 10 days walk into the desert. Use the asymptotic approximation 
Hn  ∼  ln n to show that it will take more than a million years for the explorer to recover the Holy 
Grail.
