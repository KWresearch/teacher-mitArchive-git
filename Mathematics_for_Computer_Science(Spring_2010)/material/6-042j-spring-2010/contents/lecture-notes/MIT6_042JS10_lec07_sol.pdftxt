Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 3, Wed. 

Problem 1. 
For each of  the  logical  formulas,  indicate whether or not  it  is  true when  the domain of discourse 
is N (the nonnegative integers 0, 1, 2, . . . ), Z (the integers), Q (the rationals), R (the real numbers), 
and C (the complex numbers). 

∃x 
(x2  =  2) 
∀x  ∃y 
(x2  =  y) 
∀y  ∃x 
(x2  =  y) 
∀x = 0 
∃y 
(xy  =  1) 
∃x  ∃y  (x + 2y  =  2) ∧ (2x + 4y = 5)

Problem 2. 
The  goal  of  this  problem  is  to  translate  some  assertions  about  binary  strings  into  logic  notation. 
The domain of discourse is the set of all ﬁnite-length binary strings:  λ, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, 001, 
. . . .  (Here  λ  denotes  the  empty  string.)  In  your  translations,  you may  use  all  the  ordinary  logic 
symbols (including =), variables, and the binary symbols 0, 1 denoting 0, 1. 
A string like 01x0y  of binary symbols and variables denotes the concatenation of the symbols and 
the binary strings represented by the variables. For example, if the value of x is 011 and the value 
of y  is 1111, then the value of 01x0y  is the binary string 0101101111. 
Here are some examples of formulas and their English translations. Names for these predicates are 
listed in the third column so that you can reuse them in your solutions (as we do in the deﬁnition 
of the predicate NO -1 S  below). 

Meaning 
x is a preﬁx of y 
x is a substring of y 
x is empty or a string of 0’s 

Formula 
∃z  (xz = y) 
∃u∃v (uxv = y) 
NOT(SU B S TR ING(1, x)) 

Name 
PR E FIX (x, y ) 
SU B S TR ING (x, y ) 
NO -1 S (x)

Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 3, Wed. 

(a)  x consists of three copies of some string. 
Solution.  ∃y (x = yyy) 

(b)  x is an even-length string of 0’s. 
Solution.  NO -1 S(x) ∧ ∃y (x = yy) 

(c)  x does not contain both a 0 and a 1. 

Solution.  NOT[SU B S TR ING(0, x) AND  SU B S TR ING(1, x)] 

(d)  x is the binary representation of 2k  + 1 for some integer k ≥ 0. 
Solution.  (x = 10) OR  (∃y (x = 1y1 AND  NO -1 S(y))) 

(e)  An elegant, slightly trickier way to deﬁne NO -1 S(x) is: 

Explain why (*) is true only when x is a string of 0’s. 

PR E FIX(x, 0x).

(*) 

Solution.  Preﬁxing x with 0 rightshifts all the bits.  So the nth symbol of x shifts into the (n + 1)st 
symbol of 0x.  Now  for x  to be a preﬁx of  0x,  the n + 1st  symbol of  0x must match  the  (n + 1)st 
symbol of x.  So if x satisﬁes (*), the nth and (n + 1)st symbols of x must match.  This holds for all 
n >  0 up to the length of x, that is, all the symbols of x must be the same.  In addition, if x =� λ, it 
must start with 0. Therefore, if x satisﬁes (*), all its symbols must be 0’s. 
Note that it’s easy to see, conversely, that if x = λ or x is all 0’s, then of course it satisﬁes (*).  �
