Problem 1.

2 is irrational, for example, how about 
Generalize the proof from lecture (reproduced below) that 
2?  Remember that an  irrational number  is a number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two

integers. 

Theorem. 

√
2 is an irrational number. 

√
2 is rational, that is, 

Proof.  The proof is by contradiction:  assume that 
√
n
, 
d 
where n and d are  integers.  Now consider  the smallest such positive  integer denomi­
nator, d. We will prove in a moment that the numerator, n, and the denominator, d, are 
both even. This implies that 

2 = 

(1)

is a fraction equal to 

n/2

d/2

√
2 with a smaller positive integer denominator, a contradiction.

√
√
2 is rational leads to this contradiction, the assumption 
Since the assumption that 
2  is  indeed  irrational.  This  italicized  comment  on  the 
must  be  false.  That  is, 
implication of the contradiction normally goes without saying, but since this 
is the ﬁrst 6.042 exercise about proof by contradiction, we’ve said it. 

To prove that n and d have 2 as a common factor, we start by squaring both sides of (1) 
and get 2 = n2/d2 , so 

2d2  = n 2 . 
So 2 is a factor of n2 , which is only possible if 2 is in fact a factor of n.

This means that n = 2k for some integer, k , so


n 2  = (2k)2  = 4k2 . 

Combining (2) and (3) gives 2d2  = 4k2 , so 

d2  = 2k2 . 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

So  2  is  a  factor  of  d2 ,  which  again  is  only  possible  if  2  is  in  fact  also  a  factor  of  d,  as 
� 
claimed.

Problem 2. 
Here is a generalization of Problem 1 that you may not have thought of: 
· · · 
+ an−1xm−1  + xm  be integers. 

Lemma 2.1.  Let the coefﬁcients of the polynomial a0  + a1x + a2x2  +
Then any real root of the polynomial is either integral or irrational. 
√
m

(a)  Explain why Lemma 2.1 immediately implies that 
power of some integer. 

k  is irrational whenever k  is not an mth 

(b)  Collaborate  with  your  tablemates  to  write  a  clear,  textbook  quality  proof  of  Lemma  2.1  on 
your  whiteboard.  (Besides  clarity  and  correctness,  textbook  quality  requires  good  English  with 
proper  punctuation.  When  a  real  textbook  writer  does  this,  it  usually  takes  multiple  revisions; 
if  you’re  satisﬁed with  your  ﬁrst  draft,  you’re  probably misjudging.)  You may  ﬁnd  it  helpful  to 
appeal to the following: 
Lemma 2.2.  If a prime, p, is a factor of some power of an integer, then it is a factor of that integer. 
You may assume Lemma 2.2 without writing down its proof, but see if you can explain why it is 
true. 

Problem 3. 
If we raise an irrational number to an irrational power, can the result be rational?  Show that it can

√
Problem 4. 
2  is  irrational,  taken  from  the  American Mathematical Monthly, 
Here  is  a  different  proof  that 
v.116, #1, Jan.  2009, p.69: 
q  is  a  nonnegative  integer.  Let  q �  ::= �√
such  that  �√

easy computation shows that �√
2 − 1 � 
2 is rational, and choose the least integer, q > 0, 
Proof.  Suppose for the sake of contradiction that 
q .  Clearly  0  < q �  < q .  But  an 
q �  is a nonnegative integer, contradicting the minimality of 
� 
q . 
(a)  This  proof was written  for  an  audience  of  college  teachers,  and  is  a  little more  concise  than 
desirable at this point in 6.042. Write out a more complete version which includes an explanation 
of each step. 

(b)  Now that you have justiﬁed the steps in this proof, do you have a preference for one of these 
proofs over the other? Why? Discuss these questions with your teammates for a few minutes and 
summarize your team’s answers on your whiteboard.
