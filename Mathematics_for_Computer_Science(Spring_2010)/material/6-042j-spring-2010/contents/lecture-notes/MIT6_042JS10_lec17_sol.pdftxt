Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 6, Fri. 

Problem 1. 
Prove that a graph is a tree iff it has a unique simple path between any two vertices. 

Solution.  Theorem  10.3.1  shows  that  in  a  tree  there  are  unique  simple  paths  between  any  two 
vertices. 
Conversely,  suppose we have a graph, G, with unique paths.  Now G  is  connected  since  there  is 
a path between any two vertices.  So we need only show that G has no simple cycles.  But if there 
was a simple cycle in G, there are two paths between any two vertices on the cycle (going one way 
around the cycle or the other way around), a violation of uniqueness.  So G must cannot have any 
� 
simple cycles. 

Problem 2. 
The  n-dimensional  hypercube,  Hn ,  is  a  graph whose  vertices  are  the  binary  strings  of  length  n. 
Two vertices are adjacent if and only if they differ in exactly 1 bit. For example, in H3 , vertices 111 
and 011 are adjacent because  they differ only  in  the ﬁrst bit, while vertices 101 and 011 are not 
adjacent because they differ at both the ﬁrst and second bits. 

(a)  Prove that it is impossible to ﬁnd two spanning trees of H3  that do not share some edge. 

Solution.  H3  has 8 vertices so every spanning tree has 7 edges.  But H3  has only 12 edges, so any 
two sets of 7 edges must overlap.

(b)  Verify  that  for  any  two  vertices  x  =�
y  of H3 ,  there  are  3  paths  from  x  to  y  in H3 ,  such  that, 
besides x and y , no two of those paths have a vertex in common. 

Solution.  Deﬁne the distance between two binary strings of length n to be the number of positions 
at which they differ (this is known as the Hamming distance between the strings).

To  show  that  there  are  3  paths  between  any  two  distance  1  strings,  we  can,  by  symmetry,  just

consider paths between the vertices 000 and 001.

Paths from 000 to 001: 

000, 001 
000, 010, 011, 001 
000, 100, 101, 001

Likewise for distance 2, it is enough to ﬁnd paths between 000 and 011: 

000, 010, 011 
000, 001, 011 
000, 100, 110, 111, 011 

Finally, for distance 3 from 000 to 111: 

000, 001, 011, 111 
000, 010, 110, 111 
000, 100, 101, 111

(c)  Conclude that the connectivity of H3  is 3. 

Solution.  Since  there  are  three  paths  from  x  to  y  in  H3  that  share  no  edges  with  one  another, 
removing  any  two  edges  will  leave  one  of  these  paths  intact,  so  x  and  y  remain  connected.  So 
removing two edges from H3  does not disconnect it. 
On the other hand, removing all 3 edges incident to any vertex, disconnects that vertex.  Thus the 
� 
minimum number of edges necessary to disconnect H3  is 3. 
(d)  Try extending your reasoning to H4 .  (In fact, the connectivity of Hn  is n for all n ≥ 1. A proof 
appears in the problem solution.) 

Solution.  Two paths  in a graph are said  to  cross when  they have a vertex  in common other  than 
their endpoints.  A set of paths in a graph don’t cross when no two paths in the set cross.  A graph 
is k-routed if between every pair of distinct vertices in the graph there is a set of k paths that don’t 
cross. 
We’ll show that 
Lemma 2.1. 

Hn  is n-routed for all n ≥ 1. 

Since Hn  can be disconnected by deleting the n edges incident to any vertex, this implies that Hn 
has connectivity n. 

Proof.  The proof is by induction on n with induction hypothesis, 

P (n) ::= Hn  is n-routed. 

Base case [n = 1]:  Since H1  consists of two vertices connected by an edge, P (1) is immediate. 
Base  case  [n  = 2]:  H2  is  a  square.  Vertices  on  opposite  corners  are  obviously  connected  by  two 
length 2 paths that don’t cross, and adjacent vertices are connected by a length 1 path and a length 
3 path.

Inductive  step:  We  prove  P (n +  1)  for  n  ≥  2  by  letting  v  and  w  be  two  vertices  of  Hn+1  and 
describing n + 1 paths between them that don’t cross. 
Let R by any positive length path in Hn , say 

For b ∈ {0, 1} deﬁne the Hn+1  path 

R = r0 , r1 , . . . , rk . 

bR ::= br0 , br1 , . . . , brk . 
Case  1:  The  distance  from  v  to w  is  d  ≤  n.  In  this  case,  the  (n + 1)-bit  strings  v  and w  agree  in 
one or more positions.  By symmetry, we can assume without loss of generality that v  and w both 
start with 0. That is v = 0v �  and w = 0w �  for some n-bit strings v � , w � . Now by induction, there are 
paths, Qi  for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, that don’t cross going between v �  and w �  in Hn . 
Deﬁne the ﬁrst n paths in Hn+1  between v and w to be 

πi  ::= 0Qi 
for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. These paths don’t cross since the Qi ’s don’t cross. 
Then deﬁne the n + 1st path 

πn+1  ::= v ,  1πv � ,w� , w 
where πv � ,w�  is any simple path from v �  to w �  in Hn . Then πn+1  obviously does not cross any of the

other paths since 1πv � ,w�  is vertex disjoint from 0Qi  for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

This proves that P (n + 1) hold in this case.

Case 2: The distance from v  to w is n + 1. By symmetry, we can assume without loss of generality

that v = 0n+1  and w = 1n+1 .

Now by  induction,  there are n paths  from 0n  to 1n  in Hn  that don’t  cross  in Hn .  We  can assume 
wlog1  that each of these paths is simple. 
Removing  the  shared  ﬁrst  vertex,  0n ,  of  these  paths  yields  paths  R1 , R2 , . . . , Rn .  Now  the  Ri ’s 
are  vertex  disjoint  except  for  their  common  endpoint,  1n .  Let  si  be  the  start  vertex  of  the Ri  for 
1 ≤ i ≤ n. 
We now deﬁne n + 1 paths in Hn+1  from 0n+1  to 1n+1  that don’t cross. 
The ﬁrst of these paths will be 

π1  ::= 0n+1 , 10n , 1R1 . 
For 2 ≤ i ≤ n, the ith of these paths will be 

πi  ::= 0n+1 , 0si , 1Ri . 

These paths don’t cross because 
•	 the  paths  1Ri  for  1  ≤  i  ≤  n  are  vertex  disjoint  except  for  their  common  endpoint,  1n+1 , 
because the Ri ’s are vertex disjoint except for their common endpoint, 1n , 

1without loss of generality

•	 a  vertex  0si  does  not  appear  on  πj  for  any  for  j  =�
sj  for  j  =�
i  because  the  si  =�
other vertices on the πj ’s start with 1, 
•	 the  vertex  10n  appears  only  on  π1 .  This  follows  because  if  it  appeared  on  πi  for  i  =�
1  it 
must appear on 1Ri .  That would imply that 0n  appears on Ri , contradicting the fact that the 
original path 0n , Ri  in Hn  is simple. 

i,  and  the 

Finally, the n + 1st path will be 

πn+1  ::= 0n+1 , 0R1 , 1n+1 . 
Note that, since all but the ﬁnal vertex on πn+1  start with 0, the only vertices besides the endpoints 
that πn+1  could share with another path would be 0si  for 2 ≤  i ≤  n.  But none of these appear on 
πn+1  because, except for their shared endpoint, R1  is vertex disjoint from all the other Ri ’s. 
This  proves  that  P (n + 1)  holds  in  case  2,  and  therefore  holds  in  all  cases,  which  completes  the 
� 
proof by induction. 

Note that this proof implicitly deﬁnes a recursive procedure that, for any two vertices in Hn , ﬁnds 
� 
between the two vertices n simple paths of length at most n + 1 that don’t cross.
