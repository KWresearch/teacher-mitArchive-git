Problem 1.

[A Baseball Series] 

The New  York  Yankees  and  the  Boston  Red  Sox  are  playing  a  two-out-of-three  series.  (In  other 
words, they play until one team has won two games. Then that team is declared the overall winner 
and the series ends.)  Assume that the Red Sox win each game with probability 3/5, regardless of 
the outcomes of previous games. 
Answer  the questions below using  the  four step method.  You can use  the same  tree diagram  for 
all three problems. 

(a)  What is the probability that a total of 3 games are played? 

(b)  What is the probability that the winner of the series loses the ﬁrst game? 

(c)  What is the probability that the correct team wins the series? 

Problem 2. 
To determine which of two people gets a prize, a coin is ﬂipped twice.  If the ﬂips are a Head and 
then  a Tail,  the ﬁrst player wins.  If  the ﬂips  are  a Tail  and  then  a Head,  the  second player wins. 
However, if both coins land the same way, the ﬂips don’t count and whole the process starts over. 
Assume  that  on  each ﬂip,  a Head  comes up with probability  p,  regardless  of what happened  on 
other  ﬂips.  Use  the  four  step  method  to  ﬁnd  a  simple  formula  for  the  probability  that  the  ﬁrst 
player wins. What is the probability that neither player wins? 
Suggestions: The tree diagram and sample space are inﬁnite, so you’re not going to ﬁnish drawing 
the tree.  Try drawing only enough to see a pattern.  Summing all the winning outcome probabil­
ities directly is difﬁcult.  However, a neat trick solves this problem and many others.  Let s be the 
sum of all winning outcome probabilities in the whole tree.  Notice that you can write the sum of all 
the winning probabilities in certain subtrees as a function of s. Use this observation to write an equation 
in s and then solve. 

Problem 3. 
Suppose there is a system with n components, and we know from past experience that any partic­
ular component will fail in a given year with probability p. That is, letting Fi  be the event that the 
ith component fails within one year, we have 
Pr {Fi} = p

for  1  ≤  i  ≤  n.  The  system will  fail  if  any  one of  its  components  fails.  What  can we  say  about  the 
probability that the system will fail within one year? 
Let  F  be  the  event  that  the  system  fails  within  one  year.  Without  any  additional  assumptions, 
we can’t get an exact answer  for Pr {F }.  However, we can give useful upper and  lower bounds, 
namely, 
p ≤ Pr {F } ≤ np. 
(1) 
We  may  as  well  assume  p <  1/n,  since  the  upper  bound  is  trivial  otherwise.  For  example,  if 
n  =  100  and  p  =  10−5 ,  we  conclude  that  there  is  at  most  one  chance  in  1000  of  system  failure 
within a year and at least one chance in 100,000. 
Let’s model this situation with the sample space S ::= P ({1, . . . , n}) whose outcomes are subsets of 
positive integers ≤ n, where s ∈ S  corresponds to the indices of exactly those components that fail 
within one year.  For  example,  {2, 5}  is  the  outcome  that  the  second  and ﬁfth  components  failed 
within  a  year  and  none  of  the  other  components  failed.  So  the  outcome  that  the  system did  not 
fail corresponds to the emptyset, ∅. 
(a)  Show that the probability that the system fails could be as small as p by describing appropriate 
probabilities for the outcomes.  Make sure to verify that the sum of your outcome probabilities is 
1. 

(b)  Show that the probability that the system fails could actually be as large as np by describing 
appropriate  probabilities  for  the  outcomes.  Make  sure  to  verify  that  the  sum  of  your  outcome 
probabilities is 1. 

(c)  Prove inequality (1). You may assume the Union Bound in the Appendix. 

Problem 4. 
Here are some handy rules for reasoning about probabilities that all follow directly from the Dis­
joint Sum Rule in the Appendix. Prove them. 

Pr {A − B } = Pr {A} − Pr {A ∩ B } 
�  � 
Pr  A  = 1 − Pr {A} 

(Difference Rule) 

(Complement Rule) 

Pr {A ∪ B } = Pr {A} + Pr {B } − Pr {A ∩ B } 

(Inclusion-Exclusion) 

Pr {A ∪ B } ≤ Pr {A} + Pr {B } . 

(2-event Union Bound) 

If A ⊆ B ,  then  Pr {A} ≤ Pr {B } . 

(Monotonicity)

The Four Step Method 

3 

This  is a good approach  to questions of  the  form, “What  is  the probability  that ——-?”  Intuition 
can be misleading, but this formal approach gives the right answer every time. 

1.  Find the sample space.  (Use a tree diagram.) 

2.  Deﬁne events of interest.  (Mark leaves corresponding to these events.) 

3.  Determine outcome probabilities: 

(a)  Assign edge probabilities. 
(b)  Compute outcome probabilities.  (Multiply along root-to-leaf paths.) 

4.  Compute event probabilities.  (Sum the probabilities of all outcomes in the event.) 

Probability Spaces 
A countable sample space, S ,  is a nonempty countable set.  An element w  ∈ S  is called an outcome. 
A subset of S  is called an event. 
A  probability  space  consists  of  a  sample  space,  S ,  and  a  function  Pr {}  :  S →  [0, 1],  called  the 
� 
probability function, such that 
Pr {w} = 1. 
w∈S 
� 
For  any  event,  E  ⊆ S ,  the  probability  of  E  is  deﬁned  to  be  the  sum  of  the  probabilities  of  the 
outcomes in E : 
Pr {E } ::= 
Pr {w} . 
w∈E 

Sum Rule & Union Bound 

Let  E0 , E1 , . . .  be  a  (possibly  inﬁnite)  sequence  of  events.  These  events  are  said  to  be  pairwise 
disjoint if Ei  ∩ Ej  = ∅ whenever i =�
j .
