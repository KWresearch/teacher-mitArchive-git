“Greedy” Coloring 

coloring arbitrary graphs 

…color vertices in any order. 
next vertex gets a color 
different from its neighbors. 
 k neighbors, so 
k+1 colors always work 

2-colorable? --easy to check 
3-colorable? --hard to check 
(even if planar) 
find (G)?   --theoretically 
  no harder than 3-color, but
  harder in practice

Bottleneck Lemma 

Hall’s Theorem 

If there is a bottleneck,
then no match is possible, 
obviously. 

Conversely, if there are
no bottlenecks, then 
there is a match.

Hall’s Theorem 
Hall’s condition 
If |S||N(S)| for all
sets of girls, S, then 
there is a match.

(proof in Notes) 

How to verify no bottlenecks? 
fairly efficient matching 
procedure is known 
(explained in algorithms 
 subjects) 
…but there is a special situation 
which ensures a match:

How to verify no bottlenecks? 
If every girl likes  d  boys, 
and every boy likes  d  girls, 
then no bottlenecks. 
proof: say set S of girls has 
e incident edges:
 d(cid:1)(cid:1)N(S)|
d(cid:1)(cid:1)|S|  e
      |S|  |N(S)|
so no bottleneck
