Problem 1.

[A Baseball Series] 

The New  York  Yankees  and  the  Boston  Red  Sox  are  playing  a  two-out-of-three  series.  (In  other 
words, they play until one team has won two games. Then that team is declared the overall winner 
and the series ends.)  Assume that the Red Sox win each game with probability 3/5, regardless of 
the outcomes of previous games. 
Answer  the questions below using  the  four step method.  You can use  the same  tree diagram  for 
all three problems. 

(a)  What is the probability that a total of 3 games are played? 

(b)  What is the probability that the winner of the series loses the ﬁrst game? 

(c)  What is the probability that the correct team wins the series? 

Solution.  A tree diagram is worked out below. 

From the tree diagram, we get:

Pr {3 games played} =
Pr {winner lost ﬁrst game} =
Pr {correct team wins} =

Problem 2. 
To determine which of two people gets a prize, a coin is ﬂipped twice.  If the ﬂips are a Head and 
then  a Tail,  the ﬁrst player wins.  If  the ﬂips  are  a Tail  and  then  a Head,  the  second player wins. 
However, if both coins land the same way, the ﬂips don’t count and whole the process starts over. 
Assume  that  on  each ﬂip,  a Head  comes up with probability  p,  regardless  of what happened  on 
other  ﬂips.  Use  the  four  step  method  to  ﬁnd  a  simple  formula  for  the  probability  that  the  ﬁrst 
player wins. What is the probability that neither player wins? 
Suggestions: The tree diagram and sample space are inﬁnite, so you’re not going to ﬁnish drawing 
the tree.  Try drawing only enough to see a pattern.  Summing all the winning outcome probabil­
ities directly is difﬁcult.  However, a neat trick solves this problem and many others.  Let s be the 
sum of all winning outcome probabilities in the whole tree.  Notice that you can write the sum of all 
the winning probabilities in certain subtrees as a function of s. Use this observation to write an equation 
in s and then solve. 

Solution.  In  the  tree  diagram  below,  the  small  triangles  represent  subtrees  that  are  themselves 
complete copies of the whole tree. 

Let  s  equal  the  sum  of  all  winning  probabilities  in  the  whole  tree.  There  are  two  extra  edges 
with probability p on the path to each outcome in the top subtree.  Therefore, the sum of winning 
probabilities  in  the  upper  tree  is  p2s.  Similarly,  the  sum  of  winning  probabilities  in  the  lower 
subtree is (1 − p)2s. This gives the equation: 

s = p 2 s + (1 − p)2 s + p(1 − p) 

The solution to this equation is s = 1/2, for all p between 0 and 1.

For any string s ∈ S , 

By symmetry, the probability that the ﬁrst player loses is 1/2. This means that the event, if any, of 
ﬂipping forever can only have probability zero. 
Formally, the sample space is the (inﬁnite) set of leaves of the tree, namely, 
S  ::= {TT, HH}∗  · {HT, TH} 
where  {TT, HH}∗  denotes  the  set of  strings  formed by  concatenating  a  sequence of HH’s  and TT’s. 
For example, 
TTTTHHHT, HHTTTH, HHHHHHHHHT, HT ∈ S .

Problem 3. 
Suppose there is a system with n components, and we know from past experience that any partic­
ular component will fail in a given year with probability p. That is, letting Fi  be the event that the 
ith component fails within one year, we have 
Pr {Fi} = p 
for  1  ≤  i  ≤  n.  The  system will  fail  if  any  one of  its  components  fails.  What  can we  say  about  the 
probability that the system will fail within one year? 
Let  F  be  the  event  that  the  system  fails  within  one  year.  Without  any  additional  assumptions, 
we can’t get an exact answer  for Pr {F }.  However, we can give useful upper and  lower bounds, 
namely, 
p ≤ Pr {F } ≤ np. 
(1) 
We  may  as  well  assume  p <  1/n,  since  the  upper  bound  is  trivial  otherwise.  For  example,  if 
n  =  100  and  p  =  10−5 ,  we  conclude  that  there  is  at  most  one  chance  in  1000  of  system  failure 
within a year and at least one chance in 100,000.

Let’s model this situation with the sample space S ::= P ({1, . . . , n}) whose outcomes are subsets of 
positive integers ≤ n, where s ∈ S  corresponds to the indices of exactly those components that fail 
within one year.  For  example,  {2, 5}  is  the  outcome  that  the  second  and ﬁfth  components  failed 
within  a  year  and  none  of  the  other  components  failed.  So  the  outcome  that  the  system did  not 
fail corresponds to the emptyset, ∅. 
(a)  Show that the probability that the system fails could be as small as p by describing appropriate 
probabilities for the outcomes.  Make sure to verify that the sum of your outcome probabilities is 
1. 

Solution.  There  could  be  a  probability  p  of  system  failure  if  all  the  individual  failures  occur  to­
gether. That is, let Pr {{1, . . . , n}} ::= p, Pr {∅} ::= 1 − p, and let the probability of all other outcomes 
be zero. So Fi  = {s ∈ S  | i ∈ s} and Pr {Fi} = 0 + 0 + · · · + 0 + Pr {{1, . . . , n}} = Pr {{1, . . . , n}} = p. 
Also, the only outcome with positive probability in F  is {1, . . . , n}, so Pr {F } = p, as required.  � 

(b)  Show that the probability that the system fails could actually be as large as np by describing 
appropriate  probabilities  for  the  outcomes.  Make  sure  to  verify  that  the  sum  of  your  outcome 
probabilities is 1. 

Solution.  F  = 

Solution.  Suppose at most one component ever fails at a time.  That is, Pr {{i}} = p for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 
Pr {∅}  = 1 − np, and probability of all other outcomes  is zero.  The sum of the probabilities of all 
the outcomes is one, so this is a well-deﬁned probability space. Also, the only outcome in Fi  with 
positive  probability  is  {i},  so  Pr {Fi}  =  Pr {{i}}  =  p  as  required.  Finally,  Pr {F }  =  np  because 
F  = {A ⊆ {1, . . . , n} | A =�
∅}, so F  in particular contains all the n outcomes of the form {i}.  �

Problem 4. 
Here are some handy rules for reasoning about probabilities that all follow directly from the Dis­
joint Sum Rule in the Appendix. Prove them. 

Pr {A − B } = Pr {A} − Pr {A ∩ B } 

(Difference Rule) 

Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 12, Wed. 
Solution.  Any set A is the disjoint union of A − B  and A ∩ B , so 
Pr {A} = Pr {A − B } + Pr {A ∩ B } 

by the Disjoint Sum Rule. 

�  � 
Pr  A  = 1 − Pr {A} 
�  � 
Solution.  A ::= S − A, so by the Difference Rule 
Pr  A  = Pr {S } − Pr {A} = 1 − Pr {A} . 

Pr {A ∪ B } = Pr {A} + Pr {B } − Pr {A ∩ B } 
Solution.  A ∪ B  is the disjoint union of A and B − A so 
Pr {A ∪ B } = Pr {A} + Pr {B − A} 
= Pr {A} + (Pr {B } − Pr {A ∩ B })

If A ⊆ B ,  then  Pr {A} ≤ Pr {B } . 

(Monotonicity) 

Solution. 

Pr {A} = Pr {B } − (Pr {B } − Pr {A})

= Pr {B } − Pr {B − A}
