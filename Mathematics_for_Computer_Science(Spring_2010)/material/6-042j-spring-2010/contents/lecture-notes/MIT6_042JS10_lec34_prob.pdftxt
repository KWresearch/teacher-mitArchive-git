In-Class Problems Week 12, Fri. 

Problem 1. 
There  are  two  decks  of  cards.  One  is  complete,  but  the  other  is missing  the  ace  of  spades.  Sup­
pose you pick one of  the  two decks with equal probability and  then  select a  card  from  that deck 
uniformly at random.  What  is the probability that you picked the complete deck, given that you 
selected the eight of hearts? Use the four-step method and a tree diagram. 

Problem 2. 
There  are  three  prisoners  in  a  maximum-security  prison  for  ﬁctional  villains:  the  Evil  Wizard 
Voldemort, the Dark Lord Sauron, and Little Bunny Foo-Foo.  The parole board has declared that 
it will release two of the three, chosen uniformly at random, but has not yet released their names. 
Naturally, Sauron ﬁgures  that he will be released  to his home  in Mordor, where  the shadows  lie, 
with probability 2/3. 
A guard offers  to  tell Sauron  the name of one of  the other prisoners who will be  released  (either 
Voldemort or Foo-Foo). Sauron knows the guard to be a truthful fellow. However, Sauron declines 
this offer. He reasons that if the guard says, for example, “Little Bunny Foo-Foo will be released”, 
then his own probability of release will drop to 1/2.  This is because he will then know that either 
he or Voldemort will also be released, and these two events are equally likely. 
Using a  tree diagram and  the  four-step method,  either prove  that  the Dark Lord Sauron has  rea­
soned correctly or prove that he is wrong. Assume that if the guard has a choice of naming either 
Voldemort or Foo-Foo (because both are to be released), then he names one of the two uniformly 
at random. 

Problem 3. 
Suppose that you ﬂip three fair, mutually independent coins. Deﬁne the following events: 

•  Let A be the event that the ﬁrst coin is heads. 

•  Let B be the event that the second coin is heads. 

•  Let C  be the event that the third coin is heads. 

•  Let D be the event that an even number of  coins are heads. 
(a)  Use  the  four  step  method  to  determine  the  probability  space  for  this  experiment  and  the 
probability of each of A, B , C, D . 

(b)  Show that these events are not mutually independent. 

(c)  Show that they are 3-way independent.

The Four Step Method 

In-Class Problems Week 12, Fri. 

This  is a good approach  to questions of  the  form, “What  is  the probability  that ——-?”  Intuition 
can be misleading, but this formal approach gives the right answer every time. 

1.  Find the sample space.  (Use a tree diagram.) 

2.  Deﬁne events of interest.  (Mark leaves corresponding to these events.) 

3.  Determine outcome probabilities: 

(a)  Assign edge probabilities. 
(b)  Compute outcome probabilities.  (Multiply along root-to-leaf paths.) 

4.  Compute event probabilities.  (Sum the probabilities of all outcomes in the event.) 

Conditional Probabilitiy 
For events E , F  such that Pr {F } = 0
, the conditional probability of E  given F  is: 
Pr {E ∩ F }
Pr {E  |  F } ::= 
Pr {F } 

Law of Total Probability 

Here is the Law stated for three sets:  suppose E , F , G are pairwise disjoint events, and 
A ⊆ E ∪ F  ∪ G. 

Then 

Pr {A} = Pr {A ∩ E } + Pr {A ∩ F } + Pr {A ∩ G} 
= Pr {A  |  E } · Pr {E } + Pr {A  |  F } · Pr {F } + Pr {A  |  G} · Pr {G} . 

Independence 

Events E , F  are independent iff 

Pr {E ∩ F } = Pr {E } · Pr {F } .

Events E1 , E2 , . . . , En  are mutually independent if and only if 
Pr {Ei}
Ei  = 
Pr 
i∈J 
i∈J

for all subsets J  ⊆ {1, . . . , n}.

Events E1 , E2 , . . . , are k-way independent iff every k of these events are mutually independent.
