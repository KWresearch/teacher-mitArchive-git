Problem 1. 
Let’s see what it takes to make Carnival Dice fair. Here’s the game with payoff parameter k : make 
three independent rolls of a fair die.  If you roll a six 

•  no times, then you lose 1 dollar. 

•  exactly once, then you win 1 dollar. 

•  exactly twice, then you win two dollars. 

•  all three times, then you win k dollars. 

For what value of k  is this game fair? 

Solution.  Let the random variable P  be your payoff. Then we can compute E [P ] as follows: 
� �3
� �2 � � 
� � � �2 
� �3 
E [P ] = −1  Pr {0 sixes} + 1  Pr {1 six} + 2  Pr {2 sixes} + k  Pr {3 sixes}

The game is fair when E [P ] = 0. This happens when k = 20.

Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 13, Wed. 

If  there  is  a  girl  in  front,  behind,  to  the  left,  or  to  the  right  of  a  boy,  then  the  two  of  them  ﬂirt. 
One  student may  be  in multiple  ﬂirting  couples;  for  example,  a  student  in  a  corner  of  the  class­
room can ﬂirt with up  to  two others, while a  student  in  the center can ﬂirt with as many as  four 
others.  Suppose  that  desks  are  occupied  by  boys  and  girls with  equal  probability  and mutually 
independently. What is the expected number of ﬂirting couples? Hint: Linearity. 

Solution.  First, let’s count the number of pairs of adjacent desks. There are three in each row and 
·
· 
three in each column.  Since there are four rows and four columns, there are 3  4 + 3  4 = 24 pairs
of adjacent desks. 
Number  these  pairs  of  adjacent  desks  from  1  to  24.  Let  Fi  be  an  indicator  for  the  event  that 
� 
� �  � 
occupants of the desks in the i-th pair are ﬂirting. The probability we want is then:

(Fi  is an indicator) 

The  occupants  of  adjacent  desks  are  ﬂirting  iff  they  are  of  opposite  sexes,  which  happens  with 
� 
� 
probability 1/2, that is, Pr {Fi  = 1} = 1/2. Plugging this into the previous expression gives:

Problem 3.  (a)  Suppose we ﬂip a fair coin until two Tails in a row come up. What is the expected 
number, NTT , of ﬂips we perform?  Hint:  Let D  be the tree diagram for this process.  Explain why 
· 
·
· 
D = H D + T  (H D + T ). Use the Law of Total Expectation 20.3.5

(b)  Suppose we ﬂip a fair coin until a Tail immediately followed by a Head come up. What is the 
expected number, NTH , of ﬂips we perform? 

Solution.  NTH  = 4.

·
· 
· 
This time the tree diagram C  = H C + T B where the subtree B = H + T B .

So

where NB  is the expected number of ﬂips in the B  subtree. But

which implies NTH  = 4.

(c)  Suppose we now play a game:  ﬂip a fair coin until either TT or TH ﬁrst occurs.  You win if TT 
comes up ﬁrst,  lose  if TH  comes up ﬁrst.  Since TT  takes  50%  longer on  average  to  turn up,  your 
opponent agrees that he has the advantage.  So you tell him you’re willing to play if you pay him 
$5 when he wins, but he merely pays you a 20% premium, that is, $6, when you win. 
If  you  do  this,  you’re  sneakily  taking  advantage  of  your  opponent’s  untrained  intuition,  since 
you’ve gotten him to agree to unfair odds. What is your expected proﬁt per game? 

Solution.  It’s  easy  to  see  that  both  TT  and  TH  are  equally  likely  to  show  up  ﬁrst.  (Every  game 
play  consists  of  a  sequence  of  H’s  followed  by  a  T,  after which  the  game  ends with  a  T  or  an  H, 
with equal probability.)  So your expected proﬁt is 

dollars, that is 50 cents per game.  So leap to play.
