Problem 1. 
An  explorer  is  trying  to  reach  the  Holy  Grail,  which  she  believes  is  located  in  a  desert  shrine  d 
days walk  from  the  nearest  oasis.  In  the  desert  heat,  the  explorer must  drink  continuously.  She 
can carry at most 1 gallon of water, which is enough for 1 day. However, she is free to create water 
caches out in the desert. 
For example, if the shrine were 2/3 of a day’s walk into the desert, then she could recover the Holy 
Grail with the following strategy.  She leaves the oasis with 1 gallon of water, travels 1/3 day into 
the desert, caches 1/3 gallon, and then walks back to the oasis— arriving just as her water supply 
runs  out.  Then  she  picks  up  another  gallon  of water  at  the  oasis, walks  1/3  day  into  the  desert, 
tops  off her water  supply  by  taking  the  1/3  gallon  in her  cache, walks  the  remaining  1/3 day  to 
the shine, grabs the Holy Grail, and then walks for 2/3 of a day back to the oasis— again arriving 
with no water to spare. 
But what if the shrine were located farther away? 

(a)  What  is  the most distant point  that  the explorer can reach and  then return  to  the oasis  if she 
takes only 1 gallon from the oasis? 

Solution.  At best she can walk 1/2 day into the desert and then walk back. 

� 

(b)  What is the most distant point the explorer can reach and still return to the oasis if she takes 
only 2 gallons from the oasis? No proof is required; just do the best you can. 

Solution.  The explorer walks 1/4 day  into  the desert, drops 1/2 gallon,  then walks home.  Next, 
she  walks  1/4  day  into  the  desert,  picks  up  1/4  gallon  from  her  cache,  walks  an  additional  1/2 
day  out  and  back,  then  picks  up  another  1/4  gallon  from  her  cache  and walks  home.  Thus,  her 
� 
maximum distance from the oasis is 3/4 of a day’s walk. 

(c)  The explorer will travel using a recursive strategy to go far into the desert and back drawing 
a  total  of n  gallons  of water  from  the  oasis.  Her  strategy  is  to  build up  a  cache  of n − 1  gallons, 
plus enough to get home, a certain fraction of a day’s distance into the desert. On the last delivery 
to the cache, instead of returning home, she proceeds recursively with her n − 1 gallon strategy to 
go  farther  into  the desert and  return  to  the cache.  At  this point,  the cache has  just enough water 
left to get her home. 
Prove  that with n gallons of water,  this strategy will get her Hn/2 days  into  the desert and back, 
where Hn  is the nth Harmonic number:

Solution.  To build up the ﬁrst cache of n − 1 gallons, she should make n trips 1/(2n) days into the 
desert, dropping off (n − 1)/n gallons each time.  Before she leaves the cache for the last time, she 
has n − 1 gallons plus enough  for  the walk home.  Then she applies her  (n − 1)-day strategy.  So 
letting Dn  be her maximum distance into the desert and back, we have

(d)  Suppose that the shrine is d = 10 days walk into the desert. Use the asymptotic approximation 
Hn  ∼  ln n to show that it will take more than a million years for the explorer to recover the Holy 
Grail.

Solution.  She obtains the Grail when:

Problem 2. 
There is a number a such that  ∞
i=1 ip  converges iff p < a. What is the value of a? Prove it. 
Solution.  a = −1. 
For p  =  −1,  the sum  is the harmonic series which we know does not converge.  Since the term ip

is increasing in p for i > 1, the sum will be larger, and hence also diverge for p > −1.

For p < −1 there exists an � > 0 such that p = −(1 + �). By the integral method,

Hence the sum is bounded above, and since it is increasing, it has a ﬁnite limit, that is, it converges.
