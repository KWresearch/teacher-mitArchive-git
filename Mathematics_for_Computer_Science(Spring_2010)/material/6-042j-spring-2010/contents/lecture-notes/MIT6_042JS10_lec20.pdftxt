Planar Graphs 

4 Continuous Faces here 

A graph is planar if there 
is a way to draw it in the 
plane without edges crossing.

Planar Embedding 
A planar embedding is a  
connected graph along with  
its face boundary cycles 
(same graph may have 
different embeddings) 

Same graph, different embeddings

length 3 face 
length 7 face

Recursive Def: Planar Embeddings 
Base: a graph consisting of  
•  single vertex, v,  
•  with a single face: 
      length 0 cycle from v to v, 
is a PE.

v

Adding an edge to an embedding 
Two constructor cases: 
1)  Add edge across a face 
(splits face in two) 
2) Add bridge between 
connected components 
(merges 2 outer faces)

Team Problem 

Euler's Formula 

Problem 1 

If a planar embedding has  
v vertices, e edges, and f 
faces, then 
v – e + f = 2

Euler's Formula 
Proof by structural 
induction on embeddings: 
base case: 1 vertex 
v = 1, e = 0, f = 1 
1 – 0 + 1 = 2 

Adding an edge to a drawing 
Constructor case (split face): 
v  stays the same 
e  increases by 1 
f  increases by 1 
so v – e + f stays the same

Adding an edge to a drawing 
Constructor case (add bridge):  
  v =   v1 + v2  
-(              ) 
  e =   e1 + e2 + 1 
- 
  f =   f1  + f2 – 1  
(two outer faces 
 merge into one) 
2 = 
2  +  2 - 2  

Planar Properties 
•  an edge appears twice on faces 
•  face length ≥ 3         (for v ≥ 3) 
  3(e-v+2) = 
so                  3f  ≤
    so total face length  = 2e 
combining with Euler 
e ≤ 3v-6

Planar Properties 
e ≤ 3v-6 
Cor:  K5 is not planar 
pf:  v = 5, e = 10 
      10  3·5 - 6 

Planar Properties 
e ≤ 3v-6 
Cor:  Every planar graph has 
a vertex of degree ≤ 5 
pf: suppose all degrees ≥ 6 
Then 
6v ≤ ∑ degrees = 2e 
≤ 6v-12 
contradiction!

Planar Properties 

Euler's Formula 

Cor:  Every planar graph has 
a vertex of degree ≤ 5 
Therefore, 
every planar graph 
is 6-colorable 

Cor: There are at most 
5 regular polyhedra
