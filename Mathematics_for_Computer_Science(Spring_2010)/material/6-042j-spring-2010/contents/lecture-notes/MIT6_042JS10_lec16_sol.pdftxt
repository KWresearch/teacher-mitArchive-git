Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 6, Wed. 

Problem 1. 
For each of  the  following pairs of graphs,  either deﬁne an  isomorphism between  them,  or prove 
that there is none.  (We write ab as shorthand for a—b.) 

(a) 

G1  with V1  = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} , E1  = {12, 23, 34, 14, 15, 35, 45}

G2  with V2  = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} , E2  = {12, 23, 34, 45, 51, 24, 25}

Solution.  Not isomorphic: G2  has a node, 2, of degree 4, but the maximum degree in G1  is 3.  � 

(b) 

G3  with V3  = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} , E3  = {12, 23, 34, 14, 45, 56, 26}

G4  with V4  = {a, b, c, d, e, f } , E4  = {ab, bc, cd, de, ae, ef , cf }


Solution.  Isomorphic (two isomorphisms) with the vertex correspondences: 
1f , 2c, 3d, 4e, 5a, 6b 
or 1f , 2e, 3d, 4c, 5b, 6a 

� 

(c) 

G5  with V5  = {a, b, c, d, e, f , g , h} , E5  = {ab, bc, cd, ad, ef , f g , gh, he, dh, bf }
G6  with V6  = {s, t, u, v , w, x, y , z} , E6  = {st, tu, uv , sv , wx, xy , yz , wz , sw, vz} 

Solution.  Not  isomorphic:  they  have  the  same  number  of  vertices,  edges,  and  set  of  vertex  de­
grees.  But the degree 2 vertices of G1  are all adjacent to two degree 3 vertices, while the degree 2 
vertices of G2  are all adjacent to one degree 2 vertex and one degree 3 vertex.

Problem 2.

Deﬁnition ??. A graph is connected iff there is a path between every pair of its vertices.


False Claim.  If every vertex in a graph has positive degree, then the graph is connected. 

(a)  Prove that this Claim is indeed false by providing a counterexample.

Solution.  There are many counterexamples; here is one: 

� 

(b)  Since  the Claim  is  false,  there must be an  logical mistake  in  the  following bogus proof.  Pin­
point the ﬁrst logical mistake (unjustiﬁed step) in the proof. 

Bogus proof.  We  prove  the  Claim  above  by  induction.  Let  P (n)  be  the  proposition  that  if  every

vertex in an n-vertex graph has positive degree, then the graph is connected.

Base  cases: (n  ≤  2).  In  a  graph with  1  vertex,  that  vertex  cannot  have  positive  degree,  so  P (1)

holds vacuously.

P (2) holds because there is only one graph with two vertices of positive degree, namely, the graph

with an edge between the vertices, and this graph is connected.

Inductive step: We must show that P (n) implies P (n+1) for all n ≥ 2. Consider an n-vertex graph

in which every vertex has positive degree.  By the assumption P (n), this graph is connected;  that

is,  there  is  a  path  between  every  pair  of  vertices.  Now  we  add  one  more  vertex  x  to  obtain  an

(n + 1)-vertex graph:


All that remains is to check that there is a path from x to every other vertex z .  Since x has positive 
degree, there is an edge from x to some other vertex, y .  Thus, we can obtain a path from x to z by 
going from x to y and then following the path from y  to z . This proves P (n + 1). 
By the principle of induction, P (n) is true for all n ≥ 0, which proves the Claim. 

� 

Solution.  This one  is  tricky:  the proof  is actually a good proof of something else.  The ﬁrst error 
in the proof is only in the ﬁnal statement of the inductive step:  “This proves P (n + 1)”. 
The issue is that to prove P (n + 1), every (n + 1)-vertex positive-degree graph must be shown to be 
connected.  But  the proof doesn’t show  this.  Instead,  it shows  that every  (n + 1)-vertex positive-
degree graph that can be built up by adding a vertex of positive degree to an n-vertex connected graph, is 
connected.

The problem is that not every (n + 1)-vertex positive-degree graph can be built up in this way. The 
counterexample above illustrates this:  there is no way to build that 4-vertex positive-degree graph 
from a 3-vertex positive-degree graph. 
More generally, this is an example of “buildup error ”.  This error arises from a faulty assumption 
that every size n + 1 graph with some property can be “built up”  in some particular way  from a 
size n graph with the same property.  (This assumption is correct for some properties, but incorrect 
for others— such as the one in the argument above.) 
One way  to  avoid  an  accidental  build-up  error  is  to  use  a  “shrink  down,  grow  back”  process  in 
the  inductive  step:  start with  a  size n + 1  graph,  remove  a  vertex  (or  edge),  apply  the  inductive 
hypothesis  P (n)  to  the  smaller  graph,  and  then  add  back  the  vertex  (or  edge)  and  argue  that 
P (n + 1)  holds.  Let’s  see what would  have  happened  if we’d  tried  to prove  the  claim  above  by 
this method: 
Inductive step: We must show that P (n) implies P (n + 1) for all n ≥ 1.  Consider an (n + 1)-vertex 
graph  G  in  which  every  vertex  has  degree  at  least  1.  Remove  an  arbitrary  vertex  v ,  leaving  an 
n-vertex graph G�  in which every vertex has degree... uh-oh! 
The reduced graph G�  might contain a vertex of degree 0, making the  inductive hypothesis P (n) 
� 
inapplicable! We are stuck— and properly so, since the claim is false! 

Problem 3.  (a)  Prove that in every graph, there are an even number of vertices of odd degree. 
Hint: The Handshaking Lemma ??. 
�
� 
� 
Solution.  Proof.  Partitioning  the vertices  into  those  of  even degree  and  those  of  odd degree, we 
know 
d(v) 
d(v) + 
v∈V
d(v)  is odd 
d(v)  is even 

d(v) = 

By the Handshaking Lemma, the value of the lefthand side of this equation equals twice the num­
ber  of  edges,  and  so  is  even.  The  ﬁrst  summand  on  the  righthand  side  is  even  since  it  is  a  sum 
of even values.  So  the  second summand on  the  righthand side must also be even.  But since  it  is 
entirely a sum of odd values,  it must must contain an even number of terms.  That  is,  there must 
� 
be an even number of vertices with odd degree. 

(b)  Conclude  that at a party where some people shake hands,  the number of people who shake 
hands an odd number of times is an even number. 

Solution.  We can represent the people at the party by the vertices of a graph.  If two people shake 
hands,  then  there  is an edge between the corresponding vertices.  So the degree of a vertex  is the 
number  of  handshakes  the  corresponding  person  performed.  The  result  in  the  ﬁrst  part  of  this 
problem now implies that there are an even number of odd-degree vertices, which translates into 
� 
an even number of people who shook an odd number of hands. 

(c)  Call  a  sequence  of  two  or more  different  people  at  the  party  a  handshake  sequence  if,  except 
for  the  last  person,  each  person  in  the  sequence  has  shaken  hands  with  the  next  person  in  the 
sequence.

Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 6, Wed. 

Suppose George was at  the party and has shaken hands with an odd number of people.  Explain 
why,  starting with George,  there must  be  a  handshake  sequence  ending with  a  different  person 
who has shaken an odd number of hands. 
Hint:  Just look at the people at the ends of handshake sequences that start with George. 

Solution.  The handshake graph between just the people at the ends of handshake sequences that 
start with George  is  a  graph,  so  by  part  (b),  it must  have  an  even  number  of  people who  shake 
an  odd  number  of  hands.  In  particular,  there must  be  at  least  one  other  person  besides George, 
call him Harry, who has also shaken an odd number of hands.  So  the handshake sequence  from 
� 
George that ends with Harry is what we were looking for.
