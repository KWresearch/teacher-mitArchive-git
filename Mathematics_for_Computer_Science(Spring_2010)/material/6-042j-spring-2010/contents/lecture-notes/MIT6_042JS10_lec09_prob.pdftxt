Problem 2.  (a)  Prove by induction that a 2n × 2n  courtyard with a 1 × 1 statue of Bill in a corner can 
be covered with L-shaped tiles.  (Do not assume or reprove the (stronger) result of Theorem 6.1.2 
that  Bill  can  be  placed  anywhere.  The  point  of  this  problem  is  to  show  a  different  induction 
hypothesis that works.) 

(b)  Use the result of part (a) to prove the original claim that there is a tiling with Bill in the middle. 

Problem 3. 
Find the ﬂaw in the following bogus proof that a = 1 for all nonnegative integers n, whenever a 
n
is a nonzero real number. 

Bogus proof.  The proof is by induction on n, with hypothesis 
P (n) ::= ∀k ≤ n. a k  = 1, 

where k  is a nonnegative integer valued variable. 
Base  Case:  P (0)  is  equivalent  to  a0  = 1,  which  is  true  by  deﬁnition  of  a0 .  (By  convention,  this 
holds even if a = 0.) 
Inductive Step: By induction hypothesis, ak  = 1 for all k ∈ N such that k ≤ n. But then

which  implies  that P (n + 1) holds.  It  follows by  induction  that P (n) holds  for all n  ∈  N,  and  in 
particular, an  = 1 holds for all n ∈ N.

Problem 4. 
Deﬁne the potential, p(S ), of a stack of blocks, S , to be k(k − 1)/2 where k  is the number of blocks 
in S . Deﬁne the potential, p(A), of a set of stacks, A, to be the sum of the potentials of the stacks in 
A. 
Generalize Theorem 6.2.2 about scores in the stacking game to show that for any set of stacks, A, 
if a sequence of moves starting with A leads to another set of stacks, B , then p(A) ≥ p(B ), and the 
score for this sequence of moves is p(A) − p(B ). 
Hint: Try induction on the number of moves to get from A to B .
