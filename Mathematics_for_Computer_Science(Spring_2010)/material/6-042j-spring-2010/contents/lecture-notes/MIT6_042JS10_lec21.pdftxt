Divisibility, GCD’s 

Arithmetic Assumptions 

assume usual rules for +,(cid:1)(cid:1), - :
a (b+c) = ab + ac, ab = ba,
(ab)c = a (bc),  a – a =0, 
a + 0 = a,  a+1 > a, ….

The Division Theorem 
    For b > 0 and any a, have 
q = quotient(a,b)
r = remainder(a,b)
 unique numbers q, r such that 
a = qb + r   and   0  r < b.
Take this for granted too!

Divisibility

c divides a (c|a) iff
a = k(cid:1)c  for some k!
5|15 because 15 = 3(cid:1)5
n|0   because  0 = 0(cid:1)n

GCD
gcd(a,b) ::= the greatest
common divisor of a and b
lemma: p prime implies 
gcd(p,a) = 1 or p
proof: The only divisors 
of p are ±1 & ±p.

gcd(a,b) = sa+tb
Proof: Show how to find 
coefficients s,t.
Method: apply Euclidean 
algorithm, finding 
coefficients as you go. 

Finding s and t

Example: a = 899, b=493
Example: a = 899, b=493
899 = 1·493 + 406    so 406 = 1·899 + -1·493 
899 = 1·493 + 406
493 = 1·406 + 87        so 87 = 493 – 1·406
493 = 1·406 + 87
                                           = -1·899 + 2·493 
406 = 4·87 + 58         so 58 = 406 - 4·87 
406 = 4·87 + 58
                                           = 5·899 + -9·493 
87   = 1·58 + 29          so 29 = 87 – 1·58 
87   = 1·58 + 29
                                           = -6·899 + 11·493 
58   = 2·29 + 0               done, gcd = 29 
58   = 2·29 + 0               done, gcd = 29

Finding s and t

Finding s > 0 and t

Example: a = 899, b=493
Example: a = 899, b=493
899 = 1·493 + 406    so 406 = 1·899 + -1·493 
899 = 1·493 + 406
493 = 1·406 + 87        so 87 = 493 – 1·406
493 = 1·406 + 87
                                           = -1·899 + 2·493 
406 = 4·87 + 58         so 58 = 406 - 4·87 
406 = 4·87 + 58
                                           = 5·899 + -9·493 
87   = 1·58 + 29          so 29 = 87 – 1·58 
87   = 1·58 + 29
                                           = -6·899 + 11·493
58   = 2·29 + 0               done, gcd = 29 
58   = 2·29 + 0               done, gcd = 29

 gcd(899,493) = -6·899 + 11·493
get positive coeff. for 899?: 
(-6+493k)·899 + (11-899k)·493
    = -6·899 + 11·493
so use k=1: 487·899 + -888·493
   = gcd(899,493)
