(b)  Give an example of a collection of sets partially ordered by the proper subset relation, ⊂, that 
is isomorphic to (“same shape as”) the prerequisite relation among MIT subjects from part (a). 
� 
� 
Solution.  For each subject, S , let 
preset(S ) ::=  S �  | S �  is an indirect prerequisite of S OR S �  = S . 

For example, 

preset 
subject 
{18.01, 18.02}
18.02 
{18.01, 18.03}
18.03 
{6.042, 18.01, 6.01, 8.01, 6.006} 
6.006 
Note  that  the  “ORS  =  S �”  clause  is necessary:  if we  let  the  set  representing  subject S  just be  the 
indirect prerequisites of S ,  then 18.02 and 18.03,  for example, would be  represented by  the same 
set,  {18.01}.  Then  the  correspondence between  subjects and  sets would no  longer be a bijection, 
which is a requirement for isomporphism.

(c)  Explain why  the empty  relation  is a  strict partial order and describe a collection of  sets par­
tially  ordered  by  the  proper  subset  relation  that  is  isomorphic  to  the  empty  relation  on  ﬁve  ele­
ments —that is, the relation under which none of the ﬁve elements is related to anything.

Solution.  An  empty  relation  is  always  a partial order:  it  is  vacuously  asymmetric  and  transitive. 
It’s not weak because it is not reﬂexive; in fact it’s irreﬂexive. 
Letting  the ﬁve elements be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,  the  recipe of mapping an element  to  its preimages under 
the relation, with the element itself thrown in, gives the ﬁve sets {1} , {2} , {3} , {4} , {5}. 
Of course any 5 sets none of which  is contained  in any of the others will also work,  for example, 
all the size 4 subsets of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

(d)  Describe a simple collection of sets partially ordered by the proper subset relation that is iso­
morphic to the ”properly contains” relation, ⊃, on P {1, 2, 3, 4}. 

Solution.  The  standard  inverse  image  solution  involves  sets  of  subsets.  A  more  elegant  corre­
spondence is to let each set A ⊆ {1, 2, 3, 4} correspond to its complement. That is, 
f (A) = A ::= {1, 2, 3, 4} − A. 
This works because A ⊃ B  iff A ⊂ B

Problem 2. 
A binary  relation, R,  on  a  set, A,  is  irreﬂexive  iff  NOT(a R a)  for all a  ∈  A.  Prove  that  if  a binary 
relation on a set is transitive and irreﬂexive, then it is strict partial order. 

Solution.  Proof.  Suppose  R  transitive  and  irreﬂexive.  Since  it  is  transitive,  to  check  that  it  is  a 
strict partial order, we need only verify that it is asymmetric. 
To prove that it is asymmetric, suppose a R b holds for some a, b ∈ A. We need to prove NO T(b R 
a). 
So  assume  to  the  contrary  that  b R  a  holds.  Then  a R b  and  b R  a,  so  by  transitivity,  a R a, 
� 
contradicting the fact that R is irreﬂexive.  So b R a does not hold, as claimed. 

Problem 3. 
How many binary relations are there on the set {0, 1}? 
How  many  are  there  that  are  transitive?,  . . . asymmetric?,  . . . reﬂexive?,  . . . irreﬂexive?,  . . . strict 
partial orders?, . . . weak partial orders? 
Hint: There are easier ways to ﬁnd these numbers than listing all the relations and checking which 
properties each one has. 

Solution.  There  are  24  =  16  such  relations,  since  in  any  such  relation  there  are  four  possible 
arrows between {0, 1} and itself, each of which may or may not be there. 
There are 3 intransitive transitive relations, because the only way transitivity can fail in a relation 
on  two  elements  is when  there  is  an  arrow  in  both  directions  between  the  elements,  but  one  or 
the other or both  the elements are missing a self-loop,  that  is, an arrow  that starts and ends at  the 
element.  So there are 13 = 16 − 3 transitive relations.

Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 4, Wed. 

There  are  3  asymmetric  relations.  Asymmetry  implies no  self-loops,  and  at most  one  of  the  two 
possible  arrows  between  0  and  1.  So  the  only  3  possibilities  are  no  arrows,  arrow  from  0  to  1, 
arrow from 1 to 0. 
There  are  4  reﬂexive  relations,  because  two  of  the  four  possible  arrows  (the  self-loops) must  be 
present, the remaining two arrows can be either present or not present, which yields 22  relations. 
There are 4 irreﬂexive relations for the same reason. 
There are 3 strict partial orders, because the 3 asymmetric relations are all transitive. 
There  are  3  weak  partial  orders,  because  the  3  strict  partial  orders  remain  distinct  after  adding 
self-loops to both elements.
