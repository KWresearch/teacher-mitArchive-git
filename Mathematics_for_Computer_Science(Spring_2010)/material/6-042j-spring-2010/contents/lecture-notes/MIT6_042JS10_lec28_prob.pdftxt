Problem 1. 
The Tao of BOOKKEEPER: we seek enlightenment through contemplation of the word BOOKKEEP ER. 

(a)  In how many ways can you arrange the letters in the word P OKE ? 

(b)  In how many ways can you arrange the letters in the word BO1O2K ?  Observe that we have 
subscripted the O’s to make them distinct symbols. 

(c)  Suppose  we  map  arrangements  of  the  letters  in  BO1O2K  to  arrangements  of  the  letters  in 
BOOK  by  erasing  the  subscripts.  Indicate  with  arrows  how  the  arrangements  on  the  left  are 
mapped to the arrangements on the right.

(d)  What kind of mapping is this, young grasshopper? 

(e)  In light of the Division Rule, how many arrangements are there of BOOK ? 

(f)  Very good, young master! How many arrangements are there of the letters in KE1E2P E3R? 

(g)  Suppose we map each arrangement of KE1E2P E3R to an arrangement of KEEP ER by eras­
ing subscripts.  List all the different arrangements of KE1E2P E3R that are mapped to REP EEK 
in this way. 

(h)  What kind of mapping is this? 

(i)  So how many arrangements are there of the letters in KEEP ER? 

(j)  Now you are ready to face the BOOKKEEPER! 
How many arrangements of BO1O2K1K2E1E2P E3R are there? 

(k)  How many arrangements of BOOK1K2E1E2P E3R are there? 

(l)  How many arrangements of BOOKKE1E2P E3R are there?

(m)  How many arrangements of BOOKKEEP ER are there? 

Remember well what you have learned:  subscripts on, subscripts off.

This is the Tao of Bookkeeper.


(n)  How many arrangements of V OODOODOLL are there? 

(o)  How many length 52 sequences of digits contain exactly 17 two’s, 23 ﬁves, and 12 nines? 

Problem 2.  (a)  Show  that  the  Magician  could  not  pull  off  the  trick  with  a  deck  larger  than  124

cards.

Hint: Compare the number of 5-card hands in an n-card deck with the number of 4-card sequences.


(b)  Show that, in principle, the Magician could pull off the Card Trick with a deck of 124 cards. 
Hint: Hall’s Theorem and degree-constrained (10.6.5) graphs. 

Problem 3. 
The Magician  can determine  the  5th  card  in  a poker  hand when  his Assisant  reveals  the  other  4 
cards.  Describe a similar method for determining 2 hidden cards in a hand of 9 cards when your 
Assisant reveals the other 7 cards. 

Problem 4. 
Solve  the  following  counting  problems.  Deﬁne  an  appropriate mapping  (bijective  or  k-to-1)  be­
tween a set whose size you know and the set in question. 

(a)  An independent living group is hosting nine new candidates for membership. Each candidate 
must be assigned a task:  1 must wash pots, 2 must clean the kitchen, 3 must clean the bathrooms, 
1 must  clean  the  common  area,  and  2 must  serve dinner.  Write  a multinomial  coefﬁcient  for  the 
number of ways this can be done. 

(b)  Write a multinomial coefﬁcient for the number of nonnegative integer solutions for the equa­
tion: 

x1  + x2  + x3  + x4  + x5  = 8. 

(1) 

(c)  How  many  nonnegative  integers  less  than  1,000,000  have  exactly  one  digit  equal  to  9  and 
have a sum of digits equal to 17?
