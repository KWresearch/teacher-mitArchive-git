Generalize the proof from lecture (reproduced below) that

Theorem.

2 is rational, that is, 

Proof.  The proof is by contradiction:  assume that

√
2 is rational leads to this contradiction, the assumption 
Since the assumption that 
2  is  indeed  irrational.  This  italicized  comment  on  the 
must  be  false.  That  is, 
implication of the contradiction normally goes without saying, but since this 
is the ﬁrst 6.042 exercise about proof by contradiction, we’ve said it. 

To prove that n and d have 2 as a common factor, we start by squaring both sides of (1) 
and get 2 = n2/d2 , so 

2d2  = n 2 . 
So 2 is a factor of n2 , which is only possible if 2 is in fact a factor of n.

This means that n = 2k for some integer, k , so


n 2  = (2k)2  = 4k2 . 

Combining (2) and (3) gives 2d2  = 4k2 , so 

d2  = 2k2 . 

(2) 

(3) 

(4) 

So  2  is  a  factor  of  d2 ,  which  again  is  only  possible  if  2  is  in  fact  also  a  factor  of  d,  as

2bn  =  a n . 

The lefthand side of the last equation is even, so an  is even. This implies that a is even as well (see 
below for justiﬁcation). 
In particular, a = 2c for some integer c. Thus, 

2bn  =  (2c)n  = 2n c n , 
bn  = 2n−1 c . 
n
Since n − 1 >  0, the righthand side of the last equation is an even number, so bn  is even.  But this 
� 
implies that b must be even as well, contradicting the fact that a/b is in lowest terms. 
Now we justify the claim that if an  is even, so is a. 
There is a simple proof by contradiction:  suppose to the contrary that a is odd.  It’s a familiar (and 
easily veriﬁed1 )  fact  that  the product of  two odd numbers  is odd,  from which  it  follows  that  the 
product of any ﬁnite number of odd numbers  is odd,  so a would also be odd,  contradicting  the 
n
fact that an  is even. 
More generally for any integers m, k  >  0, if mk  is divisible by a prime number, p, then m must be 
divisible by p.  This  follows  from  the  factorization of an  integer  into primes  (which we’ll discuss 
further  in a coming  lecture):  the primes  in  the  factorization of mk  are precisely  the primes  in  the 
factorization of m repeated k  times, so if there is a p in the factorization of mk  it must be one of k 
� 
copies of a p in the factorization of m.

Solution.  Saying that an integer, k , is not the nth power of an integer, is equivalent to saying that 
the  equation  xM  =  k  has  no  integer  solutions.  Another  way  to  say  this  is  that  the  polynomial 
x − k has no integer root. Lemma (2.1) therefore implies that any root of x − k is irrational. But

k  is, by deﬁnition, a root of this polynomial, so it is irrational. 

(b)  Collaborate  with  your  tablemates  to  write  a  clear,  textbook  quality  proof  of  Lemma  2.1  on 
your  whiteboard.  (Besides  clarity  and  correctness,  textbook  quality  requires  good  English  with 
proper  punctuation.  When  a  real  textbook  writer  does  this,  it  usually  takes  multiple  revisions; 
if  you’re  satisﬁed with  your  ﬁrst  draft,  you’re  probably misjudging.)  You may  ﬁnd  it  helpful  to 
appeal to the following: 
Lemma 2.2.  If a prime, p, is a factor of some power of an integer, then it is a factor of that integer. 
You may assume Lemma 2.2 without writing down its proof, but see if you can explain why it is 
true. 

Solution.  Proof.  Let r be a real root of the polynomial, so that 
· · · 
+ am−1 r m−1  + r m  = 0.

a0  + a1 r + a2 r 2  +

There are three cases:  either r  is an integer, or r  is irrational, or r  =  s/t for integers s and t which 
have no common factors and such that t > 1. We want to eliminate the last case, so assume for the 
sake of contradiction that it held for some r . 
Substituting s/t for r and multiplying both sides of the above equation by tm  yields: 
· · · 
a0 tm  + a1stm−1  + a2s 2 tm−2  +
+ am−1s m−1 t + s m  = 0, 
a0 tm  + a1stm−1  + a2s 2 tm−2  + · · · + s m−1 t  =  −s m . 

(5)
(6) 

Now since  t >  1,  it must have a prime  factor, p.  The prime, p,  therefore divides each  term of  the 
lefthand side of equation (6), so p also divides the righthand side, −sm .  This means that p divides 
sm ,  so by Lemma 2.2, p  is also a  factor of s.  So p  is a common  factor of s and t,  contradicting  the 
� 
fact that s and t have no common factors. 
Lemma 2.2 is a simple consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic which says that every 
integer > 1 factors into a product of primes that is unique except for the order in which the primes 
are multiplied. 
For example, here are some ways to express 140 as a product of primes: 
·
·
· 
·
·
· 
·
·
· 
· · ·  . 
140 = 2  2  5  7 = 2  5  7  2 = 7  5  2  2 = 

By the Fundamental Theorem, every such product will have exactly two occurrences of 2 and one 
each of 5 and 7.  Next, we can obviously get a product of primes equal to, say,  the third power of 
140 by taking a product that equals 140 and repeating it three times.  For example, 
· 
· 
·
·
·
·
· 
·
· 
·
· 
(140)3  = 2  2 5 7 
2 2 7 5.
2 2 7 5 

The Fundamental Theorem now says that every prime product equal to the third power of 60 must 
have the same primes as this repeated product, namely, six occurrences of 2 and three occurrences 
each of 5 and 7.  In particular,  the  only primes  that are  factors of  (140)3  are  the primes 2,  5 and  7 
that are  factors of 140.  This  reasoning applies equally well with any other  integer greater  than 1

in place of 140 and any power greater than 0 in place of 3, proving that if p is a prime factor of s , 
then p must have been a factor of s.

The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic  is also know as  the Unique Prime Factorization Theorem.

It is one of those familiar mathematical facts that is not exactly obvious. We’ll work out a proof of

Solution.  Both proofs seem about equally easy to understand. The previous problems shows that 
the ﬁrst proof  generalizes pretty directly  from  square  roots  to  kth  roots, which doesn’t  seems  as 
clear for the this second proof. On the other hand, the ﬁrst proof requires appeal to Unique Prime
