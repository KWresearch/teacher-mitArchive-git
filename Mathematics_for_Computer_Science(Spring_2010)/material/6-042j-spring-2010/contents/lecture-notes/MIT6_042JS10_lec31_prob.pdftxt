Problem 1. 
We  are  interested  in  generating  functions  for  the  number  of  different ways  to  compose  a  bag  of 
n donuts subject  to various restrictions.  For each of the restrictions  in (a)-(e) below, ﬁnd a closed 
form for the corresponding generating function. 

(a)  All the donuts are chocolate and there are at least 3. 

(b)  All the donuts are glazed and there are at most 2. 

(c)  All the donuts are coconut and there are exactly 2 or there are none. 

(d)  All the donuts are plain and their number is a multiple of 4. 

(e)  The donuts must be chocolate, glazed, coconut, or plain and: 

•  there must be at least 3 chocolate donuts, and 
•  there must be at most 2 glazed, and 
•  there must be exactly 0 or 2 coconut, and 
•  there must be a multiple of 4 plain. 

(f)  Find a closed form for the number of ways to select n donuts subject to the constraints of the 
previous part. 

Problem 2.  (a)  Let 

S (x) ::= 

x2  + x 
(1 − x)3 
.
What is the coefﬁcient of xn  in the generating function series for S (x)? 
� 
(b)  Explain  why  S (x)/(1 − x)  is  the  generating  function  for  the  sums  of  squares.  That  is,  the 
coefﬁcient of xn  in the series for S (x)/(1 − x) is 
n  k2 .
k=1 
(c)  Use the previous parts to prove that 
n� 
k2  = 
k=1 

n(n + 1)(2n + 1)

Partial Fractions 

Here’s a particular case of the Partial Fraction Rule that should be enough to illustrate the general 
Rule. Let 

p(x) 
(1 − αx)2 (1 − βx)(1 − γx)3 
where α, β , γ  are distinct  complex numbers,  and p(x)  is a polynomial of degree  less  than  the de­
moninator, namely, less than 6. Then there are unique numbers a1 , a2 , b, c1 , c2 , c3  ∈ C such that 
b  +
