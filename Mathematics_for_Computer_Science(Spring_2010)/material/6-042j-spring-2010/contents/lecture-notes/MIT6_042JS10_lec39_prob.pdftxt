Problem 1. 
A gambler  is placing  $1 bets  on  the  “1st dozen”  in  roulette.  This bet wins when  a number  from 
one to twelve comes in, and then the gambler gets his $1 back plus $3 more.  Recall that there are 
38 numbers on the roulette wheel. 
The  gambler ’s  initial  stake  in  $n  and  his  target  is  $T .  He will  keep  betting  until  he  runs  out  of 
money (“goes broke”) or reachs his target.  Let wn  be the probability of the gambler winning, that 
is, reaching target $T  before going broke. 

(a)  Write a linear recurrence for wn ; you need not solve the recurrence. 

(b)  Let en  be  the expected number of bets until  the game ends.  Write a  linear  recurrence  for en ; 
you need not solve the recurrence. 

Problem 2. 
Consider the following random-walk graph: 

(a)  Find a stationary distribution. 

(b)  If you  start at node x and  take a  (long)  random walk, does  the distribution over nodes ever 
get close to the stationary distribution? Explain. 

Consider the following random-walk graph: 

(c)	 Find a stationary distribution.

(d)  If you start at node w  and  take a  (long) random walk, does  the distribution over nodes ever 
get close to the stationary distribution?  We don’t want you to prove anything here, just write out 
a few steps and see what’s happening. 

Consider the following random-walk graph: 

(e)  Describe the stationary distributions for this graph. 

(f)  If you start at node b and take a long random walk, the probability you are at node d will be 
close to what fraction? Explain.

A random-walk graph is a digraph such that each edge, x
which will indicate the probability of following that edge starting at vertex x. Formally, we simply 
require that the sum of labels leaving each vertex is 1. That is, if we deﬁne for each vertex, x, 
out(x) ::= {y  | x
→ 
y  is an edge of the graph} ,
� 
p(x, y) = 1. 
y∈out(x) 
A distribution, d,  is a  labelling of each vertex, x, with a number, d(x)  ≥  0, which will  indicate  the 
� 
probability of being at x. Formally, we simply require that the sum of all the vertex labels is 1, that 
is, 
d(x) = 1, 
x∈V 
The distribution, d�, after a single step of a random walk from distribution, d, is given by 
where V  is the set of vertices. 
� 
d�(x) ::= 
· 
d(y)  p(y , x),
y∈in(x) 
where 
in(x) ::= {y  | y → x is an edge of the graph} . 
A distribution  d  is  stationary  if  d� =  d, where  d� is  the distribution  after  a  single  step  of  a  random 
� 
walk starting from d.  In other words, d stationary implies 
· 
d(y)  p(y , x).
d(x) ::= 
y∈in(x)
