Solution.  Proof.  (By Induction). The induction hypothesis is P (n) is the inequality (1). 
Base  Case: (n  = 2).  The  LHS  of(1)  in  this  case  is  1 + 1/4  and  the  RHS  is  2 −  1/2.  Since  LHS 
= 5/4 < 6/4 = 3/2 = RHS, inequality (1) holds, and P (2) is proved. 
Inductive Step:  Let n be any natural number greater  than 1,  and assume P (n)  in order  to prove 
P (n + 1). That is, we assume (1) Adding 1/(n + 1)2  to both sides of this inequality yields

Problem 2.  (a)  Prove by induction that a 2n × 2n  courtyard with a 1 × 1 statue of Bill in a corner can 
be covered with L-shaped tiles.  (Do not assume or reprove the (stronger) result of Theorem 6.1.2 
that  Bill  can  be  placed  anywhere.  The  point  of  this  problem  is  to  show  a  different  induction 
hypothesis that works.) 
Solution.  Let P (n) be the proposition Bill can be placed in a corner of a 2n  × 2n  courtyard with a 
proper tiling of the remainder with L-shaped tiles.

Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 4, Mon. 

Base case: P (0) is true because Bill ﬁlls the whole courtyard. 
Inductive step: Assume that P (n) is true for some n ≥ 0; that is, there exists a tiling of the 2n × 2n 
courtyard leaving Bill in a corner. 
To  prove,  P (n +  1),  Divide  the  2n+1  ×  2n+1  courtyard  into  four  quadrants,  each  2n  ×  2n .  One 
quadrant will contain the corner designated for Bill. By induction hypothesis, we can get Bill into 
some  corner  of  the  quadrant,  which  means  we  can  actually  get  him  into  any  desired  corner  of 
the  quadrant  by  rotating  the  tiling  of  the  quadrant.  So place Bill  in  the designated  corner  of  the 
quandrant, and tile the rest of the quadrant. 
Now tile the remaining three quadrants, leaving a tile space open in the quadrant corners that are 
in the middle of the whole 2n+1 × 2n+1  courtyard (as in the diagram in the proof of Theorem 6.1.2). 
These three spaces form an L-shape that that can be ﬁlled with a single L-shaped tile, completing 
the  full  courtyard  tiling.  This  proves P (n + 1),  completing  the  proof  by  induction  that  a  square 
courtyard with side length any power of 2 can be tiled with Bill in a corner. 

� 

(b)  Use the result of part (a) to prove the original claim that there is a tiling with Bill in the middle. 

Solution.  To put Bill  in  the middle,  tile  each  of  the  four  quadrants,  leaving  the  empty  corner  of 
the  quadrant  in  the middle  of  the  full  courtyard.  This  leaves  the  four  central  squares  of  the  full 
courtyard  empty,  so ﬁll  three of  these  squares with an L-shaped  tile.  This  leaves a  single  central 
� 
square untiled for Bill. 

Problem 3. 
Find the ﬂaw in the following bogus proof that a = 1 for all nonnegative integers n, whenever a 
n
is a nonzero real number. 

Bogus proof.  The proof is by induction on n, with hypothesis 
P (n) ::= ∀k ≤ n. a k  = 1, 
where k  is a nonnegative integer valued variable. 
Base  Case:  P (0)  is  equivalent  to  a0  = 1,  which  is  true  by  deﬁnition  of  a0 .  (By  convention,  this 
holds even if a = 0.) 
Inductive Step: By induction hypothesis, ak  = 1 for all k ∈ N such that k ≤ n. But then 
·  = 
·  = 1,

a n+1  =

which  implies  that P (n + 1) holds.  It  follows by  induction  that P (n) holds  for all n  ∈  N,  and  in 
particular, an  = 1 holds for all n ∈ N. 

� 
Solution.  The ﬂaw comes in the inductive step, where we implicitly assume n ≥ 1 in order to talk 
about an−1  in the denominator (otherwise the exponent is not a nonnegative integer, so we cannot 
apply the inductive hypothesis).  We checked the base case only for n = 0, so we are not  justiﬁed 
in assuming that n ≥ 1 when we try to prove the statement for n + 1 in the inductive step. And of 
� 
course the proposition ﬁrst breaks precisely at n = 1.

Problem 4. 
Deﬁne the potential, p(S ), of a stack of blocks, S , to be k(k − 1)/2 where k  is the number of blocks 
in S . Deﬁne the potential, p(A), of a set of stacks, A, to be the sum of the potentials of the stacks in 
A. 
Generalize Theorem 6.2.2 about scores in the stacking game to show that for any set of stacks, A, 
if a sequence of moves starting with A leads to another set of stacks, B , then p(A) ≥ p(B ), and the 
score for this sequence of moves is p(A) − p(B ). 
Hint: Try induction on the number of moves to get from A to B . 

Solution.  Proof.  The  proof  is  by  ordinary  induction  on  the  number  of moves,  n.  The  induction 
hypothesis will be 
P (n)::= If n moves from a set of stacks, A, leads to a set B  of stacks, then p(A) ≥ p(B ) 
and the score for these n moves is p(A) − p(B ). 

Base  case:  (n  =  0)  This means  no moves  have  been made  and  B  =  A,  so  it’s  obvious  that  P (0) 
holds. 
Inductive step: Assume that P (n) is true for some n ∈ N, and suppose A leads to B in n+ 1 moves. 
This means  that A  leads  to some set of stacks, A1 , and A1  leads  to B  in n steps.  So  the  inductive 
hypothesis P (n) implies that p(A1 ) ≥ p(B ) and the score for going from A1  to B  is p(A1 ) − p(B ). 
So all we have to do is show that the score for the single move from A to A1  is p(A) − p(A1 ) >  0. 
The only difference between A and A1  is that some stack S  ∈ A of size k > 1 splits into two stacks 
of sizes k1 , k2  ≥ 1 where k = k1  + k2 . The score for such a move is k1k2 . Also, 
2  + 2k1k2  + k2
(k1  + k2 )((k1  + k2 ) + 1) 
2 ) + (k1  + k2 ) 
(k1
,

p(S ) = 

= 

and the potential of the two stack sets is the sum of their potentials, namely, 

2  + k1  + k2 
2  + k2
k1 (k1  + 1) + k2 (k2  + 1) 
k1
,

2 
So the difference between these potentials equals k1k2  > 0, and this is indeed equal to the score of 
the move.
