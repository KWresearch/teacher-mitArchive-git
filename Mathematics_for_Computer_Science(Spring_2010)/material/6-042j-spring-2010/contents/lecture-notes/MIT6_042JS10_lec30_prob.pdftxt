Problem 1. 
Find the coefﬁcients of 

(a)  x5  in (1 + x)11 

(b)  x8y9  in (3x + 2y)17 

(c)  a6 b6  in (a2  + b3 )5 

Problem 2. 
You want to choose a team of m people for your startup company from a pool of n applicants, and 
�  ��  � 
from these m people you want to choose k to be the team managers. You took 6.042, so you know 
you can do this in 
n m 
m k

� 
ways. But your CFO, who went to Harvard Business School, comes up with the formula 
n − k
n
. 
k m − k 

Before doing the reasonable thing —dump on your CFO or Harvard Business School —you decide 
to check his answer against yours. 

(a)  Give a combinatorial proof  that your CFO’s formula agrees with yours. 

(b)  Verify this combinatorial proof by giving an algebraic proof of this same fact.

Problem 3.  (a)  Now give a combinatorial proof of the following, more interesting theorem: 
n

k 
k=1 

n2n−1  = 

(1)

Hint: Let S  be the set of all length-n sequences of 0’s, 1’s and a single *. 

(b)  Now prove (1) algebraically by applying the Binomial Theorem to (1 + x)n  and taking deriva­
tives.
