Problem 1. 
We  are  interested  in  generating  functions  for  the  number  of  different ways  to  compose  a  bag  of 
n donuts subject  to various restrictions.  For each of the restrictions  in (a)-(e) below, ﬁnd a closed 
form for the corresponding generating function. 

(a)  All the donuts are chocolate and there are at least 3. 

Solution. 

�0, 0, 0, 1, 1, . . . , 1, . . . �  ←→

1 − x 

(b)  All the donuts are glazed and there are at most 2. 

Solution. 

�1, 1, 1, 0, 0, . . . , 0, . . . �  ←→  1 + x + x 2 

(c)  All the donuts are coconut and there are exactly 2 or there are none. 

Solution. 

�1, 0, 1, 0, 0, . . . , 0, . . . �  ←→  1 + x 2 

(d)  All the donuts are plain and their number is a multiple of 4. 

Solution. 

�1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, . . . , 1, 0, 0, 0, . . . �  ←→

(e)  The donuts must be chocolate, glazed, coconut, or plain and: 

•  there must be at least 3 chocolate donuts, and 
•  there must be at most 2 glazed, and

(f)  Find a closed form for the number of ways to select n donuts subject to the constraints of the 
previous part.

Solution.  Let 

1 + x + x2 
(1 − x)2 (1 + x)
so the generating function for donut selections is x3G(x). By partial fractions

for some constants, A, B , C .  We know that the coefﬁcient of xn  in the series for (1 − x)2  is, by the 
Convolution Rule,  the number of ways  to  select n  items of  two different kinds,  namely,  n+1  = 
1 
n + 1, so we conclude that the nth coefﬁcient in the series for G(x) is 
A + B (n + 1) + C (−1)n . 

+ 

(2) 

To ﬁnd A, B , C , we multiply both sides of (1) by the denominator (1 − x)2 (1 + x) to obtain 
1 + x + x 2  = A(1 − x)(1 + x) + B (1 + x) + C (1 − x)2 . 
(3) 
Letting  x  = 1  in  (3), we  conclude  that  3 = 2B ,  so B  = 3/2.  Then,  letting  x  =  −1, we  conclude 
(−1)2  = C 22 , so C  = 1/4.  Finally, letting x = 0, we have

1 = A + B + C  = A + +

so A = −3/4. Then from (2), we conclude that the nth coefﬁcient in the series for G(x) is

So the nth coefﬁcient in the series for the generating function, x3G(x), for donut selections is zero 
for n < 3, and, for n ≥ 3, is the (n − 3)rd coefﬁcient of G, namely, 
6n − 15 + (−1)n−1 
6(n − 3) + 3 + (−1)n−3

Problem 2.  (a)  Let

What is the coefﬁcient of xn  in the generating function series for S (x)? 
Solution.  n2 . That is, S (x) =  ∞
n=1 n2xn . 
To see why, note that the coefﬁcient of xn  in 1/(1 − x)3  is, by the Convolution Rule, the number of

ways to select n items of three different kinds, namely, 
n + 2 
(n + 2)(n + 1)

Now the coefﬁcient of xn  in x2/(1 − x)3  is the same as the coefﬁcient of xn−2  in 1/(1 − x)3 , namely, 
((n − 2) + 2)((n − 2) + 1)/2 = n(n − 1)/2.  Similarly, the coefﬁcient of xn  in x/(1 − x)3  is the same 
as  the  coefﬁcient  of  xn−1  in  1/(1 − x)3 ,  namely,  ((n − 1) + 2)((n − 1) + 1)/2 = (n + 1)n/2.  The 
coefﬁcient of xn  in S (x) is the sum of these two coefﬁcients, namely, 
(n2  − n) + (n2  + n)

(b)  Explain  why  S (x)/(1 − x)  is  the  generating  function  for  the  sums  of  squares.  That  is,  the

(n − 1)n(n + 1)  = 
n(n + 1)(2n + 1)

Here’s a particular case of the Partial Fraction Rule that should be enough to illustrate the general 
Rule. Let

where α, β , γ  are distinct  complex numbers,  and p(x)  is a polynomial of degree  less  than  the de­
