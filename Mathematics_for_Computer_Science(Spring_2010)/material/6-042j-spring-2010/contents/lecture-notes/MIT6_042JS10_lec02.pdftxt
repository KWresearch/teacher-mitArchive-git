   Is 1332
≤ 11?
 1331
  If so, 1332 ≤ 113
That’s not true, so

Proof by Contradiction 
If an assertion implies 
something false, then 
the assertion itself 
must be false!

Proof by Contradiction 
Theorem:        is irrational. 
•  Suppose       was rational 
•  So have n, d integers without common 
   prime factors such that 

•  We will show that n & d are both even.  
  This contradicts no common factor.

Proof by Contradiction 
Theorem:        is irrational. 
so can assume 

So n is even 

So d is even 

Quickie 
Proof assumes that 
if n2  is even, then n is even. 
Why is this true?

Reasoning by cases can break a 
complicated problem into 
easier subproblems. 
Some philosophers* think 
reasoning this way is worrisome.
