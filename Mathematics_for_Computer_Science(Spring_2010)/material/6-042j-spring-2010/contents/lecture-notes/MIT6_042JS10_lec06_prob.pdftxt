Problem 1. 

Lemma 4.9.4. Let A be a set and b /∈ A.  If A is inﬁnite, then there is a bijection from A ∪ {b} to A. 

Proof.  Here’s how  to deﬁne  the bijection:  since A  is  inﬁnite,  it  certainly has at  least one element; 
call  it a0 .  But  since A  is  inﬁnite,  it has at  least  two  elements,  and one of  them must not be  equal 
to a0 ;  call this new element a1 .  But since A  is  inﬁnite,  it has at  least three elements, one of which 
must not equal a0  or a1 ; call this new element a2 . Continuing in the way, we conclude that there is 
an inﬁnite sequence a0 , a1 , a2 , . . . , an , . . .  of different elements of A. Now we can deﬁne a bijection 
f  : A ∪ {b} → A: 

f (b) ::= a0 , 
f (an ) ::= an+1 
f (a) ::= a 

for n ∈ N, 
for a ∈ A − {b, a0 , a1 , . . . } .

(a)  Several  students  felt  the proof of Lemma  4.9.4 was worrisome,  if not  circular.  What do you 
think? 

(b)  Use  the  proof  of  Lemma  4.9.4  to  show  that  if  A  is  an  inﬁnite  set,  then  there  is  surjective 
function from A to N, that is, every inﬁnite set is “as big as” the set of nonnegative integers. 

Problem 2. 
→
Let  R  :  A
B  be  a  binary  relation.  Use  an  arrow  counting  argument  to  prove  the  following 
generalization of the Mapping Rule: 
Lemma.  If R is a function, and X  ⊆ A, then 
|X | ≥ |X R| . 

Problem 3. 
Let A =  {a0 , a1 , . . . , an−1} be a set of size n, and B  =  {b0 , b1 , . . . , bm−1} a set of size m.  Prove that 
|A × B |  =  mn  by  deﬁning  a  simple  bijection  from  A × B  to  the  nonnegative  integers  from  0  to 
mn − 1.

Problem 4. 
The rational numbers ﬁll in all the spaces between the integers, so a ﬁrst thought is that there must 
be more of them than the integers, but it’s not true.  In this problem you’ll show that there are the 
same number of nonnegative rational as nonnegative integers.  In short, the nonnegative rationals 
are countable. 
(a)  Describe a bijection between all the integers, Z, and the nonnegative integers, N. 
(b)  Deﬁne a bijection between the nonnegative integers and the set, N × N, of all the ordered pairs 
of nonnegative integers: 

(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), . . . 
(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), . . . 
(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), . . . 
(3.0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), . . . 
. . . 
(c)  Conclude that N is the same size as the set, Q, of all nonnegative rational numbers.
