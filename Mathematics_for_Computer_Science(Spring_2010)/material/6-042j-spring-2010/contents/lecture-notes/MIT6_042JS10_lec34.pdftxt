Conditional Probability 

Pr{A|B} is the probability 
 of event A,given that
 event B has occurred:

Seems that the contestant may 
as well stick, since the probability
is 1/2 given what he knows  when 
he chooses. 
But wait, contestant knows more
than goat at door 2: he knows 
Carol opened door 2!

Independence
Definition 1: 
Events A and B are independent iff
Pr{A} = Pr{A | B}. 
Definition 2: 
Events A and B are independent iff
Pr{A}  Pr{B} = Pr{A  B}.

Independent Events?

B: Baby born at Mass General Hospital 
     between 1:00AM and 1:01AM. 
F: Jupiter’s moon IO is full.

Independent Events? 

Does event B (baby born) 
have anything to do with 
event F (IO is full)? 

Babies & Full Moons 
My sweet Aunt Daisy believed in 
Astrology.  She thought celestial
events could influence babies. 
We might say “nonsense,” there’s
no effect.
But Daisy might be right 
(for wrong reasons)

SUMMARY: Jupiter's HF emissions are 
…heard on earth when Jupiter's magnetic 
 field "sweeps" the earth every 9h55m27s
and at other times when Io's geometric 
position influences activity.

influence of IO’s magnetic
field changes with phases!
--might affect radios in
 ambulances, for example

So independence of B and F
is actually unclear.
  Deciding whether to treat 
them as independent is a 
matter of experiment, not 
Mathematics.
