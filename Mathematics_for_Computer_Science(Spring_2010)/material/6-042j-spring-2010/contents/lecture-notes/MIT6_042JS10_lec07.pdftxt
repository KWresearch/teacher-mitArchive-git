Predicates 

Predicate Logic 
Quantifiers ∀,∃

Propositions with variables 
Example: 
P(x,y) ::= 

[x + 2 = y]

Predicates 
[x + 2 = y] 
P(x,y) ::= 
 P(1,3) is true 
x = 1 and y = 3:  

x = 1 and y = 4:  P(1,4) is false 
      NOT(P(1,4)) is true 

Quantifiers 

For ALL x 

There EXISTS some y 

∀x 
∃y

∀ is like AND 
Let s range over 6.042 staff 
P(s) ::= [s is Pumped about 6.042] 
∀s. P(s) 
same as 
P(Stav) AND P(Rich) AND 
P(Megumi) AND…AND P(Oscar) 

∃ is like OR 
Let t range over 6.042 staff 
B(t) ::= [t took 6.042 Before] 
∃t. B(t) 
same as 
B(Stav) OR B(Rich) OR 
B(Megumi) OR…OR B(Oscar)

Existential Quantifier 
Let x, y range over  N 
         Q(y) ::= ∃x. x < y 
Q(3) is T ([x<3] is T for x=1) 
Q(1) is T  ([x<1] is T for x=0) 
Q(0) is F  ([x<0] is not T 
 
 
 
 for any x in N)

Universal Quantifier 
x, y range over N 
         R(y) ::= ∀x. x < y 
R(1) is F  ([x<1] is F for x=5) 
R(8) is F ([x<8] is F for x=12) 
R(10100) is F 
  ([x<10100] is F for x=10100)

virus attack, I: ∀∃ 

virus attack, II:∃∀ 

For every virus, I have a defense: 
against MYDOOM,      use Defender 
against ILOVEYOU,  use Norton 
against BABLAS,      use Zonealarm… 
∀∃ is expensive! 
Albert R Meyer,        February  17, 2010 

I have one defense good 
 That’s what we want!   
against every attack. 
Example: d is MITviruscan, 
protects against all viruses

Alternating Quantifiers 
G ::= ∀x∃y. x <  y 
x, y range over Domain of Discourse 
G is: 
Domain   
T
