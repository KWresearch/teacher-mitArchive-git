In-Class Problems Week 2, Fri. 

Problem 1. 
Set Formulas and Propositional Formulas. 
(a)  Verify that the propositional formula (P  AND  NOT(Q))  OR  (P  AND  Q) is equivalent to P . 

(b)  Use part (a) to prove that 

for any sets, A, B , where 

A = (A − B ) ∪ (A ∩ B ) 

A − B ::= {a ∈ A  | a ∈/  B } . 

Problem 2. 
Subset take-away1  is a two player game involving a ﬁxed ﬁnite set, A.  Players alternately choose 
nonempty subsets of A with the conditions that a player may not choose 

•  the whole set A, or 

•  any set containing a set that was named earlier. 

The ﬁrst player who is unable to move loses the game. 
For example,  if A is {1},  then there are no legal moves and the second player wins.  If A is {1, 2}, 
then the only legal moves are {1} and {2}. Each is a good reply to the other, and so once again the 
second player wins. 
The ﬁrst interesting case is when A has three elements.  This time, if the ﬁrst player picks a subset 
with  one  element,  the  second  player  picks  the  subset  with  the  other  two  elements.  If  the  ﬁrst 
player picks a  subset with  two elements,  the  second player picks  the  subset whose  sole member 
is the third element.  Both cases produce positions equivalent to the starting position when A has 
two elements, and thus leads to a win for the second player. 
Verify that when A has four elements, the second player still has a winning strategy.2 

Problem 3. 
Deﬁne a surjection relation, surj, on sets by the rule 

Deﬁnition.  A surj B  iff there is a surjective function from A to B .

2David Gale worked out some of the properties of this game and conjectured that the second player wins the game 
for any set A. This remains an open problem.

Deﬁne the injection relation, inj, on sets by the rule


Deﬁnition.  A  inj B  iff there is a total injective relation from A to B .


(a)  Prove that if A surj B  and B  surj C , then A surj C . 

(b)  Explain why A surj B  iff B  inj A. 

(c)  Conclude from (a) and (b) that if A  inj B  and B  inj C , then A  inj C .
