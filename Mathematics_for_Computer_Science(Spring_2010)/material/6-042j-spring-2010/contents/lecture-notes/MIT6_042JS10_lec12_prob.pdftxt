Problem 1. 
If a and b are distinct nodes of a digraph, then a is said to cover b if there is an edge from a to b and 
every path  from  a  to  b  traverses  this  edge.  If  a  covers  b,  the  edge  from  a  to  b  is  called  a  covering 
edge. 

(a)	 What are the covering edges in the following DAG? 

(b)	 Let covering (D) be the subgraph of D consisting of only the covering edges.  Suppose D  is a 
ﬁnite DAG. Explain why covering (D) has the same positive path relation as D . 
Hint: Consider longest paths between a pair of vertices. 

(c)  Show that if two DAG’s have the same positive path relation, then they have the same set of 
covering edges. 

(d)  Conclude that covering (D) is the unique DAG with the smallest number of edges among all 
digraphs with the same positive path relation as D . 

The  following examples show  that  the above results don’t work  in general  for digraphs with cy­
cles. 
(e)  Describe two graphs with vertices {1, 2} which have the same set of covering edges, but not 
the same positive path relation (Hint:  Self-loops.) 

(f)	

(i)  The  complete  digraph without  self-loops  on  vertices  1, 2, 3  has  edges  between  every  two 
distinct vertices. What are its covering edges?

(ii)  What are the covering edges of the graph with vertices 1, 2, 3 and edges 1
(iii)  What about their positive path relations?

Problem 2.  (a)  Give an example showing that two vertices in a digraph may be on the same cycle, 
but not necessarily on the same simple cycle. 

(b)  Prove  that  if  two  vertices  in  a  digraph  are  connected,  then  they  are  connected  by  a  simple 
path. Hint:  the shortest path. 

Problem 3. 
In  an  n-player  round-robin  tournament,  every  pair  of  distinct  players  compete  in  a  single  game. 
Assume  that  every game has a winner —there are no  ties.  The  results of  such a  tournament  can 
then be represented with a tournament digraph where the vertices correspond to players and there 
→
y  iff x beat y  in their game. 
is an edge x

(a)  Explain why a tournament digraph cannot have cycles of length 1 or 2. 

(b)  Is the “beats” relation for a tournament graph always/sometimes/never: 

•  asymmetric? 
•  reﬂexive? 
•  irreﬂexive? 
•  transitive? 

Explain. 

(c)  Show that a tournament graph represents a total order iff there are no cycles of length 3.
