Expectations

Carnival Dice 

choose a number from 1 to 6, 
then roll 3 fair dice: 
win $1 for each match
lose $1 if no match

Carnival Dice 

Example: choose 5, then
 roll 2,3,4: lose $1 
roll 5,4,6: win  $1 
 roll 5,4,5: win  $2 
 roll 5,5,5: win  $3

Carnival Dice 

So on average expect to win: 
NOT fair! 

You can “expect” to lose 8 cents
per play. 
               But you never actually 
lose 8 cents on any single play, 
this is just your average loss.

Expected Value 
The expected value of
random variable R is
the average value of R
--with values weighted 
by their probabilities 

Expected Value 
The expected value of
random variable R is
 E[R]::= vPr{R = v}

so E[$win in Carnival] =

Law of Total Expectation

conditional expectation: 

E[R] = E[R | A]  Pr{A}

good for reasoning by cases 

Let e(n) ::= expected #H’s in n flips. 
               = 1 + e(n-1)     if 1st flip H 
               = e(n-1)          if 1st flip T

be returned to their owners?
