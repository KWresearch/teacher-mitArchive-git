Well Ordering principle 
Every nonempty set of 
nonnegative integers 
has a  
least element. 
Familiar?   Now you mention it, Yes. 
Obvious?   Yes. 
Trivial?     Yes. But watch out:

Well Ordering principle

nonnegative integers 
has a  
least element. 
NO!

Well Ordering Principle Proofs 
  ∀n ∈N. P(n)
To prove                         using WOP:   
•  define set of counterexamples  
{
}
C ::= n ∈ N | NOT P(n)
  
•  assume C is not empty.  By WOP, 
 m ∈ C
have minimum element 
•  Reach a contradiction somehow … 
  usually by finding          with c < m 
 c ∈ C

Well Ordered Postage 

available stamps: 

3¢ 
5¢ 
Thm: Get any amount n ≥ 8¢ 
Prove by WOP.  Suppose not. 
Let m be least counterexample: 
if m > n ≥ 8, can get n¢.

Well Ordered Postage 
                 Now m > m-3 ≥ 8  
So m ≥ 11. 
But 
so can get m-3¢.

Geometric sums 
rn+1 − 1
1 + r + r2 + r3 +  + rn =
r − 1
   
Proof by WOP.  Let m be 
                             But = for 
smallest n with ≠. 
 n = 0, so m > 0, and 
1 + r + r2 + r3 +  + rm−1 =
   

rm − 1
r − 1

Lec 2M.15 

Geometric sums 
rm − 1
1 + r + r2 + r3 +  + rm−1 =
r − 1
   
add rm to both sides  
   LHS = 1 + r + r2 + r3 +  + rm−1 + rm
rm+1 − 1
rm − 1
rm+1 − rm
RHS =
+ rm
=
r − 1
r − 1
r − 1
  
  
  
so = at m, contradicting ≠:
there is no counterexample.
