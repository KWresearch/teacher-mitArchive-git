Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 10, Mon. 

Problem 1. 
Solve the following problems using the pigeonhole principle. For each problem, try to identify the 
pigeons, the pigeonholes, and a rule assigning each pigeon to a pigeonhole. 

(a)  Every MIT ID number starts with a 9 (we think). Suppose that each of the 75 students in 6.042 
sums  the  nine  digits  of  his  or  her  ID  number.  Explain why  two  people must  arrive  at  the  same 
sum. 

Solution.  The students are the pigeons, the possible sums are the pigeonholes, and we map each 
student  to  the  sum  of  the  digits  in  his  or  her  MIT  ID  number.  Every  sum  is  in  the  range  from 
·
· 
9 + 8  0 = 9  to  9 + 8  9 = 81, which means  that  there  are  73 pigeonholes.  Since  there  are more 
pigeons  than  pigeonholes,  there  must  be  two  pigeons  in  the  same  pigeonhole;  in  other  words, 
� 
there must be two students with the same sum. 

(b)  In every set of 100 integers, there exist two whose difference is a multiple of 37. 

Solution.  The pigeons are the 100 integers. The pigeonholes are the numbers 0 to 36. Map integer 
k  to rem(k , 37).  Since there are 100 pigeons and only 37 pigeonholes, two pigeons must go in the 
same pigeonhole.  This means rem(k1 , 37) =  rem(k2 , 37,), which implies that k1  − k2  is a multiple 
� 
of 37. 

√
(c)  For any ﬁve points inside a unit square (not on the boundary), there are two points at distance 
2. 
less than 1/

Solution.  The pigeons are the points. The pigeonholes are the four subsquares of the unit square, 
each of side length 1/2. 
Pigeons are assigned to the subsquare that contains them, except that if the pigeon is on a bound­
ary,  it  gets  assigned  to  the  leftmost  and  then  lowest  possible  subsquare  that  includes  it  (so  the 
point at (1/2, 1/2) is assigned to the lower left subsquare). 
√
There  are  ﬁve  pigeons  and  four  pigeonholes,  so more  than  one  point must  be  in  the  same  sub-
2,  so  two  pigeons  in  the  same  hole  are  at  most  this 
square.  The  diagonal  of  a  subsquare  is  1/
distance.  But  pigeons must  be  inside  the  unit  square,  so  two  pigeons  cannot  be  at  the  opposite 
ends  of  the  same  subsquare  diagonal.  So  at  least  one  of  them must  be  inside  the  subsquare,  so 
� 
their distance is less than the length of the diagonal. 
(d)  Show that if n + 1 numbers are selected from {1, 2, 3, . . . , 2n},  two must be consecutive,  that 
is, equal to k and k + 1 for some k .

Solution.  The  pigeonholes will  be  the  n  sets  {1, 2} , {3, 4} , {5, 6} , . . . , {2n − 1, 2n}.  The  pigeons 
will be the n + 1 selected numbers.  A pigeon is assigned to the unique pigeon hole of which it is 
a member.  By  the Pigeonhole Principle,  two pigeons must  assigned  to  some  hole,  and  these  are 
the two consecutive numbers required. Notice that we’ve actually shown a bit more:  there will be 
� 
two consecutive numbers with the smaller being odd. 

Problem 2. 
Answer the following quesions using the Generalized Product Rule. 

(a)  Next week, I’m going to get really ﬁt! On day 1, I’ll exercise for 5 minutes. On each subsequent 
day,  I’ll  exercise  0,  1,  2,  or  3  minutes  more  than  the  previous  day.  For  example,  the  number  of 
minutes  that  I  exercise  on  the  seven  days  of  next week might  be  5,  6,  9,  9,  9,  11,  12.  How many 
such sequences are possible? 

Solution.  The number of minutes on the ﬁrst day can be selected in 1 way. The number of minutes 
on each subsequent day can be selected in 4 ways.  Therefore, the number of exercise sequences is 
· 
�
1 46  by the extended product rule. 

(b)  An r-permutation of a set is a sequence of r distinct elements of that set.  For example, here are 
all the 2-permutations of {a, b, c, d}: 

(a, b)  (a, c)  (a, d) 
(b, a)  (b, c)  (b, d) 
(c, a)  (c, b)  (c, d) 
(d, a)  (d, b)  (d, c) 

How  many  r-permutations  of  an  n-element  set  are  there?  Express  your  answer  using  factorial 
notation. 
Solution.  There  are  n ways  to  choose  the  ﬁrst  element,  n − 1 ways  to  choose  the  second,  n − 2 
ways to choose the third, . . . , and n − r + 1 ways to choose the r-th element. Thus, there are: 
n! 
n · (n − 1) · (n − 2) · · · (n − r + 1) = 
(n − r)! 

� 
r-permutations of an n-element set. 
(c)  How many n × n matrices are there with distinct entries drawn from {1, . . . , p}, where p ≥ n2 ? 
Solution.  There are p ways to choose the ﬁrst entry, p − 1 ways to choose the second for each way 
of choosing the ﬁrst, p − 2 ways of choosing the third, and so forth.  In all there are 
p! 
(p − 
n2 )! 

p(p − 1)(p − 2) · · · (p − n 2  + 1) = 

such matrices.  Alternatively,  this  is  the  number  of  n2 -permutations  of  a  p  element  set,  which  is 
p!/(p − n2 )!.

Problem 3. 
Your 6.006 tutorial has 12 students, who are supposed to break up into 4 groups of 3 students each. 
Your TA has observed that the students waste too much time trying to form balanced groups, so 
he decided to pre-assign students to groups and email the group assignments to his students. 

(a)  Your  TA  has  a  list  of  the  12  students  in  front  of  him,  so  he  divides  the  list  into  consecutive 
groups of 3.  For example,  if  the  list  is ABCDEFGHIJKL,  the TA would deﬁne a sequence of  four 
groups  to  be  ({A, B , C } , {D , E , F } , {G, H, I } , {J, K, L}).  This way  of  forming  groups  deﬁnes  a 
mapping from a list of twelve students to a sequence of four groups.  This is a k-to-1 mapping for 
what k? 

Solution.  Two  lists map  to  the  same  sequence  of  groups  iff  the  ﬁrst  3  students  are  the  same  on 
both lists, and likewise for the second, third, and fourth consecutive sublists of 3 students.  So for 
a given sequence of 4 groups, the number of lists which map to it is 

(3!)4 

because there are 3! ways to order the students in each of the 4 consecutive sublists. 

� 

(b)  A  group  assignment  speciﬁes  which  students  are  in  the  same  group,  but  not  any  order  in 
which the groups should be listed.  If we map a sequence of 4 groups, 
({A, B , C } , {D , E , F } , {G, H, I } , {J, K, L}), 

into a group assignment 

{{A, B , C } , {D , E , F } , {G, H, I } , {J, K, L}} , 

this mapping is j -to-1 for what j ? 

Solution.  4!.

Each of the 4! sequences of a particular set of four groups maps to that set of groups. 

�


(c)  How many group assignments are possible? 

Solution. 

12!  = 15400 
· 
4!  (3!)4 

different assignments. 
There are 12! possible lists of students, and we can map each list to an assignment by ﬁrst mapping 
� 
� 
the list to a sequence of four groups, and then mapping the sequence to the assignment.  Since the 
· 
ﬁrst map is (3!)4 -to-1 and and the second is 4!-to-1, the composite map is (3!)4  4!-to-1.  So by the 
· 
�
Division Rule, 12! =  (3!)4  4!  A where A is the number of assignments. 

(d)  In how many ways can 3n students be broken up into n groups of 3?

Problem 4. 
A pizza house is having a promotional sale. Their commercial reads: 

We  offer  9  different  toppings  for  your  pizza!  Buy  3  large  pizzas  at  the  regular  price, 
and you can get each one with as many different toppings as you wish, absolutely free. 
That’s 22, 369, 621 different ways to choose your pizzas! 

The ad writer was a former Harvard student who had evaluated the formula (29 )3/3! on his calcu­
lator and gotten close to 22, 369, 621. Unfortunately, (29 )3/3! is obviously not an integer, so clearly 
something  is  wrong.  What  mistaken  reasoning  might  have  led  the  ad  writer  to  this  formula? 
Explain how to ﬁx the mistake and get a correct formula. 

Solution.  The  number  of  ways  to  choose  toppings  for  one  pizza  is  the  number  of  the  possible 
subsets of the set of 9 toppings, namely, 29 . The ad writer presumably then used the Product Rule 
to  conclude  that  there were  (29 )3  sequences  of  three  topping  choices.  Then he probably  reasoned 
that  each  way  of  making  three  topping  choices  arises  from  3!  sequences,  so  the  Division  Rule 
would imply that the number of ways to choose three pizzas is (29 )3/3!. 
It’s true that every set of three different topping choices arises from 3! different length-3 sequences 
of choices. The mistake is that if some of the three choices are the same, then the set of three choices 
arises from fewer than 3! sequences.  For example, if all three pizzas have the same toppings, there 
is only one sequence of topping choices for them. 
One  ﬁx  is  to  consider ways  to  choose  toppings with  1,  2  and  3  different  topping  choices.  There 
are 29 (29  − 1)(29  − 2)/3! ways to choose a set of 3 different choices, 29 (29  − 1) ways to choose one 
topping choice  to be used on  two pizzas and a  second choice  for  the  third pizza,  and 29  ways  to 
choose one topping for all three pizzas, giving 
29 (29  − 1)(29  − 2)  + 29 (29  − 1) + 29  = 22, 500, 864.
3! 

ways to choose three pizzas. 
Alternatively, we  can observe  that  this  is exactly  the problem of  selecting a dozen donuts of ﬁve 
possible different kinds – except now there are 3 donuts and 29  kinds.  Hence,  there  is a bijection 
�
� 
to the number of (29  + 2)-bit strings with exactly 29  − 1 ones and 3 zeros: 
29  + 2  = 22, 500, 864.
