Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 2, Mon. 

Problem 1. 
The proof below uses the Well Ordering Principle to prove that every amount of postage that can 
be  paid  exactly  using  only  6  cent  and  15  cent  stamps,  is  divisible  by  3.  Let  the  notation  “j  |  k” 
indicate that integer j  is a divisor of integer k , and let S (n) mean that exactly n cents postage can 
be paid using only 6 and 15 cent stamps. Then the proof shows that 
S (n)  IM P L I E S  3 | n, 

for all nonnegative integers n. 

(*) 

Fill in the missing portions (indicated by “. . . ”)  of the following proof of (*). 

Let C  be the set of counterexamples to (*), namely1 

C  ::= {n  | . . . } 

Solution.  n  is  a  counterexample  to  (*)  if  n  cents  postage  can  be  made  and  n  is  not 
divisible by 3, so the predicate 

S (n) and  NO T(3  | n) 

deﬁnes the set, C , of counterexamples.

Assume for the purpose of obtaining a contradiction that C  is nonempty.  Then by the 
WOP, there is a smallest number, m ∈ C . This m must be positive because. . . . 
Solution.  . . . 3 | 0, so 0 is not a counterexample. 
� 
But if S (m) holds and m is positive, then S (m − 6) or S (m − 15) must hold, because. . . . 

Solution.  . . . if m >  0  cents  postage  is made  from  6  and  15  cent  stamps,  at  least  one 
stamp  must  have  been  used,  so  removing  this  stamp  will  leave  another  amount  of 
� 
postage that can be made. 
So suppose S (m − 6) holds. Then 3 | (m − 6), because. . . 
Solution.  . . . if NOT(3  |  (m − 6)), then m − 6 would be a counterexample smaller than 
� 
m, contradicting the minimality of m.

But if 3 | (m − 6), then obviously 3 | m, contradicting the fact that m is a counterexam­
ple.

Next suppose S (m − 15) holds. Then the proof for m − 6 carries over directly for m − 15

to yield a contradiction in this case as well.  Since we get a contradiction in both cases,

we conclude that. . .

for all nonnegative integers, n. 

(1) 

Solution.  The proof is by contradiction. 
Suppose  to  the  contrary  that  equation  (1)  failed  for  some  n  ≥  0.  Then  by  the  WOP,  there  is  a 
smallest nonnegative integer, m, such that (1) does not hold when n = m. 
But (1) clearly holds when n = 0, which means that m ≥ 1.  So m − 1 is nonegative, and since it is 
smaller than m, equation (1) must be true for n = m − 1. That is, 
� 
m−1
(m − 1)((m − 1) + 1)(2(m − 1) + 1) 
.

Now add m2  to both sides of equation (2). Then the left hand side equals

k=0 

k2  =

(2)

and the right hand side equals 
(m − 1)((m − 1) + 1)(2(m − 1) + 1)  + m 2 
6 
Now a little algebra (given below) shows that the right hand side equals 
m(m + 1)(2m + 1) 
.

That is, 

m� 
k2  = 
k=0 
contradicting the fact that equation (1) does not hold for m.

It follows that there is no smallest nonnegative integer for which equation (1) fails. Hence (1) must

hold for all nonnegative integers.

Here’s the algebra:

Problem 3. 
Euler ’s Conjecture in 1769 was that there are no positive integer solutions to the equation 

4  + b4  + c 4  = d4 
. 
a

Integer  values  for  a, b, c, d  that  do  satisfy  this  equation,  were  ﬁrst  discovered  in  1986.  So  Euler 
guessed wrong, but it took more two hundred years to prove it. 
Now let’s consider Lehman’s2  equation, similar to Euler ’s but with some coefﬁcients: 

8a 4  + 4b4  + 2c 4  = d4 

(3) 

Prove that Lehman’s equation (3) really does not have any positive integer solutions. 
Hint: Consider the minimum value of a among all possible solutions to (3). 

Solution.  Suppose  that  there exists a solution.  Then  there must be a solution  in which a has  the 
smallest possible value.  We will show that,  in this solution, a, b, c, and d must all be even.  How­
ever, we can  then obtain another solution over the positive  integers with a smaller a by dividing 
a, b, c, and d in half. This is a contradiction, and so no solution exists. 
All that remains is to show that a, b, c, and d must all be even.  The left side of Lehman’s equation 
is even, so d4  is even, so d must be even.  Substituting d = 2d�  into Lehman’s equation gives: 

8a 4  + 4b4  + 2c 4  =  16d�4 

(4) 

Now 2c4  must be a multiple of 4, since every other term is a multiple of 4.  This implies that c4  is 
even and so c is also even.  Substituting c = 2c�  into the previous equation gives:

8a 4  + 4b4  + 32c�4  =  16d�4 

(5) 

Arguing  in  the  same way,  4b4  must be a mutliple of 8,  since  every other  term  is.  Therefore,  b4  is 
even and so b is even.  Substituting b = 2b�  gives: 

8a 4  + 64b�4  + 32c�4  =  16d�4 

(6) 

Finally, 8a4  must be a multiple of 16, a4  must be even, and so a must also be even.  Therefore, a, b, 
� 
c, and d must all be even, as claimed.
