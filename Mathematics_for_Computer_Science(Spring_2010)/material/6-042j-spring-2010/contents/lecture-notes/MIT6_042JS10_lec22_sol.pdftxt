Problem 1.  (a)  Use the Pulverizer to ﬁnd the inverse of 13 modulo 23 in the range {1, . . . , 22}. 

·
· 
Solution.  We ﬁrst use the Pulverizer to ﬁnd s, t such that gcd(23, 13) = s  23 + t  13, namely, 

1 = 4  23 − 7  13.
·
· 

This implies that −7 is an inverse of 13 modulo 23. 
Here is the Pulverizer calculation: 
rem(x, y) =  x − q y· 
10 = 23 − 13 
3 = 13 − 10 

=  13 − (23 − 13)

= (−1)  23 + 2  13

1 = 10 − 3 3· 
=  (23 − 13) − 3  ((−1)  23 + 2  13))

To get an inverse in the speciﬁed range, simply ﬁnd rem(−7, 23), namely 16.

(b)  Use Fermat’s theorem to ﬁnd the inverse of 13 modulo 23 in the range {1, . . . , 22}. 

Solution.  Since 23 is prime, Fermat’s theorem implies 1323−2  13 ≡ 1  (mod  23) and so rem(1323−2 , 23)
·
is the inverse of 13 in the range {1, . . . , 22}. Now using the method of repeated squaring, we have

Problem 2.  (a)  Why is a number written in decimal evenly divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of 
its digits is a multiple of 9? Hint:  10 ≡ 1  (mod  9). 
Solution.  Since 10 ≡ 1  (mod  9), so is 
10k  ≡ 1k  ≡ 1  (mod  9).	
Now a number in decimal has the form: 
dk  · 10k  + dk−1  · 10k−1  + . . . + d1  · 10 + d0 . 

(1) 

From (1), we have 
dk  · 10k  + dk−1  · 10k−1  + . . . + d1  · 10 + d0  ≡  dk  + dk−1  + . . . + d1  + d0 

(mod  9) 

This  shows  something  stronger  than what we were  asked  to  show,  namely,  it  shows  that  the  re­
mainder when the original number is divided by 9 is equal to the remainder when the sum of the 
� 
digits is divided by 9.  In particular, if one is zero, then so is the other. 

(b)  Take a big number, such as 37273761261.  Sum the digits, where every other one is negated: 
3 + (−7) + 2 + (−7) + 3 + (−7) + 6 + (−1) + 2 + (−6) + 1 = −11 
Explain why the original number is a multiple of 11 if and only if this sum is a multiple of 11.

Solution.  A number in decimal has the form: 
dk  · 10k  + dk−1  · 10k−1  + . . . + d1  · 10 + d0 
Observing that 10 ≡ −1  (mod  11), we know: 
dk  · 10k  + dk−1  · 10k−1  +
+ d1  · 10 + d0
· · · 
≡ dk  · (−1)k  + dk−1  · (−1)k−1  +

(mod  11) 

assuming k  is even. The case where k  is odd is the same with signs reversed. 
The procedure given  in  the problem computes ±  this alternating sum of digits, and hence yields 
a number divisible by 11 (≡ 0  (mod  11)) iff the original number was divisible by 11.

Problem 3. 
The following properties of equivalence mod n follow directly from its deﬁnition and simple prop­
erties of divisibility.  See if you can prove them without looking up the proofs in the text. 
(a)  If a ≡ b  (mod  n), then ac ≡ bc  (mod  n). 
Solution.  The condition a ≡ b  (mod  n) is equivalent to the assertion n | (a − b). This implies that 
n | (a − b)c, and so n | (ac − bc). This is equivalent to ac ≡ bc  (mod  n). 
� 
(b)  If a ≡ b  (mod  n) and b ≡ c  (mod  n), then a ≡ c  (mod  n). 
Solution.  Assume  a  ≡  b  (mod  n)  and  b  ≡  c  (mod  n),  that  is,  n  |  (a − b)  and  n  |  (b − c).  Then 
n | (a − b) + (b − c) = (a − c), so a ≡ c  (mod  n). 
� 
(c)  If a ≡ b  (mod  n) and c ≡ d  (mod  n), then ac ≡ bd  (mod  n). 
Solution.  a  ≡  b  (mod  n)  implies  ac  ≡  bc  (mod  n)  by  part  (a);  likewise,  c  ≡  d  (mod  n)  implies 
bc ≡ bd  (mod  n).  So ac ≡ bd  (mod  n) by part (b). 
� 
(d)  rem(a, n) ≡ a  (mod  n). 
Solution.  The remainder rem(a, n) is equal to a−qn for some integer q . However, for every integer 
q : 

n  | qn 

I FF  n  | ((a − qn) − a) 
IM P L I E S  n  | (rem(a, n) − a) 
rem(a, n) ≡ a  (mod  n).
