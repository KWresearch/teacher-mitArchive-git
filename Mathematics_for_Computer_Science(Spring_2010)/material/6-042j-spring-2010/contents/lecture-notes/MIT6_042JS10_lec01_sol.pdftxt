Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 1, Wed. 

Problem 1. 
Identify exactly where the bugs are in each of the following bogus proofs.1 
(a)  Bogus Claim:  1/8 > 1/4. 

Bogus proof. 

3 > 2

3 log10 (1/2) > 2 log10 (1/2)

log10 (1/2)3  >  log10 (1/2)2

(1/2)3  > (1/2)2 ,


and the claim now follows by the rules for multiplying fractions. 

� 

Solution.  log x <  0,  for  0  < x <  1,  so  since  both  sides  of  the  inequality  “3  >  2”  are  being 
multiplied by the negative quantity log10 (1/2), the “>” in the second line should have been “<.” 
� 

(b)  Bogus proof :  1¢ = $0.01 = ($0.1)2  = (10¢)2  = 100¢ = $1.  � 
Solution.  $0.01  =  $(0.1)2  �=  ($0.1)2  because  the  units  $2  and  $  don’t  match  (just  as  in  physics 
the  difference  between  sec2  and  sec  indicates  the  difference  between  acceleration  and  velocity). 
Similarly, (10¢)2  = 100
¢. 

� 

(c)  Bogus Claim:  If a and b are two equal real numbers, then a = 0. 

Bogus proof. 

a  =  b

a 2  =  ab

a 2  − b2  =  ab − b2

(a − b)(a + b) = (a − b)b 
a + b  =  b 
a  = 0.

Solution.  The bug is at the ﬁfth line:  one cannot cancel (a − b) from both sides of the equation on 
the fourth line because a − b = 0.

Problem 2. 
It’s a fact that the Arithmetic Mean is at least as large the Geometric Mean, namely, 
a + b  √
≥ 
2 
for all nonnegative real numbers a and b. But there’s something objectionable about the following 
proof of this fact. What’s the objection, and how would you ﬁx it? 

ab

Bogus proof. 

a + b  ?  √

a + b ≥

ab, 
a 2  + 2ab + b2  ≥ 4ab,

a 2  − 2ab + b2  ≥ 0, 
? 
so 
(a − b)2  ≥ 0 
which we know is true. 
The last statement is true because a − b is a real number, and the square of a real number is never

negative. This proves the claim.

Solution.  In  this  argument,  we  started with what we wanted  to  prove  and  then  reasoned  until 
we reached a statement that is surely true.  The little question marks presumably are supposed to 
indicate  that we’re  not  quite  certain  that  the  inequalities  are  valid  until we  get  down  to  the  last 
that  if  (a + b)/2  ≥ √
step.  At that step, the inequality checks out, but that doesn’t prove the claim.  All we have proved is 
ab,  then  (a − b)2  ≥  0, which  is not very  interesting,  since we already knew 
that the square of any nonnegative number is nonnegative. 
To  be  fair,  this  bogus  proof  is  pretty  good:  if  it  was  written  in  reverse  order  –  or  if  “is  implied 
by” was simply inserted after each line – it would actually prove the Arithmetic-Geometric Mean 
Inequality: 

Proof.

ab, 
a 2  + 2ab + b2  ≥ 4ab, 
a 2  − 2ab + b2  ≥ 0, 
(a − b)2  ≥ 0.

But  the problem with  the bogus proof as written  is  that  it  reasons backward, beginning with  the 
proposition in question and reasoning to a true conclusion.  This kind of backward reasoning can 
easily “prove” false statements. Here’s an example: 
Bogus Claim:  0 = 1. 

Bogus proof. 

?0 = 1, 
?1 = 0, 
?
0 + 1 = 1 + 0, 
1 = 1

which is trivially true, 

which proves 0 = 1.

We can also come up with very easy “proofs” of true theorems, for example, here’s an easy “proof ” 
of the Arithmetic-Geometric Mean Inequality: 

Bogus proof. 

a + b  ?  √

Problem 3. 
Albert announces that he plans a surprise 6.042 quiz next week.  His students wonder  if the quiz 
could be next Friday. The students realize that it obviously cannot, because if it hadn’t been given 
before  Friday,  everyone  would  know  that  there  was  only  Friday  left  on  which  to  give  it,  so  it 
wouldn’t be a surprise any more. 
So the students ask whether Albert could give the surprise quiz Thursday? They observe that if the 
quiz wasn’t given before Thursday,  it would have to be given on the Thursday, since they already 
know  it  can’t  be  given  on  Friday.  But  having  ﬁgured  that  out,  it  wouldn’t  be  a  surprise  if  the 
quiz was on Thursday either.  Similarly, the students reason that the quiz can’t be on Wednesday, 
Tuesday, or Monday.  Namely, it’s impossible for Albert to give a surprise quiz next week.  All the 
students now relax, having concluded that Albert must have been blufﬁng. 
And since no one expects the quiz, that’s why, when Albert gives it on Tuesday next week, it really 
is a surprise! 
What do you think is wrong with the students’ reasoning?

Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 1, Wed. 

Solution.  The  basic  problem  is  that  “surprise”  is  not  a  mathematical  concept,  nor  is  there  any 
generally  accepted  way  to  give  it  a  mathematical  deﬁnition.  The  “proof ”  above  assumes  some 
plausible axioms about surprise, without deﬁning it.  The paradox is that these axioms are incon­
sistent. But that’s no surprise :-), since —mathematically speaking —we don’t know what we’re 
talking about. 
Mathematicians and philosophers have had a lot more to say about what might be wrong with the 
students’ reasoning, (see Chow, Timothy Y. The surprise examination or unexpected hanging paradox,
