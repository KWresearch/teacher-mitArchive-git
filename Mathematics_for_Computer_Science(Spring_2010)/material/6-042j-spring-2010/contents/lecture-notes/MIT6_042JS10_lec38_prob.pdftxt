Problem 1. 
A recent Gallup poll found that 35% of the adult population of the United States believes that the 
theory of evolution  is “well-supported by  the evidence.”  Gallup polled 1928 Americans selected 
uniformly  and  independently  at  random.  Of  these,  675  asserted  belief  in  evolution,  leading  to 
Gallup’s  estimate  that  the  fraction  of  Americans  who  believe  in  evolution  is  675/1928  ≈  0.350. 
Gallup  claims a margin of error of 3 percentage points,  that  is, he  claims  to be  conﬁdent  that his 
estimate is within 0.03 of the actual percentage. 

(a)  What is the largest variance an indicator variable can have? 

(b)  Use the Pairwise Independent Sampling Theorem to determine a conﬁdence level with which 
Gallup can make his claim. 

(c)  Gallup  actually  claims greater  than  99%  conﬁdence  in his  estimate.  How might he have  ar­
rived at this conclusion?  (Just explain what quantity he could calculate; you do not need to carry 
out a calculation.) 

(d)  Accepting the accuracy of all of Gallup’s polling data and calculations, can you conclude that 
there is a high probability that the number of adult Americans who believe in evolution is 35 ± 3 
percent? 

Problem 2. 
Yesterday,  the programmers at a  local  company wrote a  large program.  To estimate  the  fraction, 
b,  of  lines  of  code  in  this program  that  are  buggy,  the QA  team will  take  a  small  sample  of  lines 
chosen randomly and independently (so it is possible, though unlikely, that the same line of code 
might be chosen more than once). For each line chosen, they can run tests that determine whether 
that  line of code  is buggy, after which they will use the fraction of buggy  lines  in their sample as 
their estimate of the fraction b. 

The company statistician can use estimates of a binomial distribution to calculate a value, s, for a 
number of lines of code to sample which ensures that with 97% conﬁdence, the fraction of buggy 
lines in the sample will be within 0.006 of the actual fraction, b, of buggy lines in the program. 
Mathematically, the program is an actual outcome that already happened.  The sample is a random 
variable deﬁned by the process for randomly choosing s lines from the program. The justiﬁcation 
for the statistician’s conﬁdence depends on some properties of the program and how the sample 
of  s  lines  of  code  from  the  program  are  chosen.  These  properties  are  described  in  some  of  the 
statements below.  Indicate which of these statements are true, and explain your answers.

•	 The probability that the ninth line of code in the program is buggy is b. 

•	 The probability that the ninth line of code chosen for the sample is defective, is b. 

•	 All lines of code in the program are equally likely to be the third line chosen in the sample. 

•	 Given  that  the ﬁrst  line  chosen  for  the  sample  is  buggy,  the probability  that  the  second  line 
chosen will also be buggy is greater than b. 

•	 Given that the last line in the program is buggy, the probability that the next-to-last line in the 
program will also be buggy is greater than b. 

•	 The expectation of the indicator variable for the last line in the sample being buggy is b. 

•	 Given  that  the  ﬁrst  two  lines  of  code  selected  in  the  sample  are  the  same  kind  of  statement 
—they might both be assignment statements, or both be conditional statements, or both loop 
statements,. . . —the probability that the ﬁrst line is buggy may be greater than b. 

•	 There is zero probability that all the lines in the sample will be different. 

Problem 3. 
A defendent in trafﬁc court is trying to beat a speeding ticket on the grounds that —since virtually 
everybody speeds on  the  turnpike —the police have unconstitutional discretion  in giving  tickets 
to anyone they choose.  (By the way, we don’t recommend this defense :-) ) 
To support his argument, the defendent arranged to get a random sample of trips by 3,125 cars on 
the turnpike and found that 94% of them broke the speed limit at some point during their trip. He 
says that as a consequence of sampling theory (in particular, the Pairwise Independent Sampling 
Theorem), the court can be 95% conﬁdent that the actual percentage of all cars that were speeding 
is 94 ± 4%. 
The  judge  observes  that  the  actual  number  of  car  trips  on  the  turnpike was  never  considered  in 
making this estimate. He is skeptical that, whether there were a thousand, a million, or 100,000,000 
car trips on the turnpike, sampling only 3,125 is sufﬁcient to be so conﬁdent. 
Suppose  you  were  were  the  defendent.  How  would  you  explain  to  the  judge  why  the  number 
of  randomly  selected  cars  that  have  to  be  checked  for  speeding  does  not  depend  on  the  number  of 
recorded  trips?  Remember  that  judges  are  not  trained  to  understand  formulas,  so  you  have  to 
provide an intuitive, nonquantitative explanation. 

Problem 4. 
An  International  Journal  of  Epidemiology  has  a  policy  that  they  will  only  publish  the  results  of  a 
drug trial when there were enough patients in the drug trial to be sure that the conclusions about

the  drug’s  effectiveness  hold  at  the  95%  conﬁdence  level.  The  editors  of  the  Journal  reason  that 
under  this policy,  their readership can be conﬁdent  that at most 5% of  the published studies will 
be mistaken. 
Later, the editors are astonished and embarrassed to learn that every one of the 20 drug trial results 
they published during the year was wrong. This happened even though the editors and reviewers 
had  carefully  checked  the  submitted  data,  and  every  one  of  the  trials was  properly  performed  and 
reported in the published paper. 
The  editors  thought  the  probability  of  this  was  negligible  (namely,  (1/20)20  <  10−25 ).  Explain 
what’s wrong with their reasoning and how it could be that all 20 published studies were wrong.
