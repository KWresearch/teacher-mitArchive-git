Problem 1. 
Find the coefﬁcients of 
(a)  x5  in (1 + x)11 

Solution. 

� �11  = 462

(b)  x8y9  in (3x + 2y)17 

� �17  3829 .
Solution.

When (3x + 2�y)� 
17  is expressed as a sum of powers of the summands 3x and 2y ,  the coefﬁcient of 
· 
�
(3x)8 (2y)9  is  17  , so the coefﬁcient of x8y9  is this binomial coefﬁcient times 38  29 .

(c)  a6 b6  in (a2  + b3 )5 

� � 
Solution.  a6 b6  = (a2 )3 (b3 )2 , so the coefﬁcient is 
5  = 10

Problem 2. 
You want to choose a team of m people for your startup company from a pool of n applicants, and 
�  ��  � 
from these m people you want to choose k to be the team managers. You took 6.042, so you know 
you can do this in 
n m 
m k 
�  �� 
� 
ways. But your CFO, who went to Harvard Business School, comes up with the formula 
n − k
n
. 
k m − k 
Before doing the reasonable thing —dump on your CFO or Harvard Business School —you decide 
to check his answer against yours.

Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 11, Wed. 

(a)  Give a combinatorial proof  that your CFO’s formula agrees with yours. 
�  �� 
� 
Solution.  Instead of choosing ﬁrst m from n and then k from the chosen m, you could alternately 
choose the k managers from the n people and then choose m − k people to ﬁll out the team from 
n − k 
the remaining n − k people.  This gives you 
n
ways of picking your team.  Since you 
k m − k 
� �� �  � �� 
� 
must have the same number of options regardless of the order in which you choose to pick team 
members and managers, 
n − k
n m  = 
n
. 
k m − k 
m k 
Formally,  in  the ﬁrst method we count  the number of pairs  (A, B ), where A  is a size m subset of 
�  �  �  � 
the pool of n applicants, and B  is a size k subset of A. By the Generalized Product Rule, there are 
m 
· 
n

m 

such pairs. 
In the second method, we count pairs (C, D), where C  is a size k subset of the applicant pool, and 
� � � 
� 
D  is  a  size  (m − k)  subset  of  the  pool  that  is  disjoint  from C .  By  the Generalized  Product Rule, 
there are 
n − k 
· 
n
m − k 
k 

such pairs. 
These  two  expressions  are  equal  because  there  is  an  obvious  bijection  between  the  two  kinds  of 
pairs, namely map (A, B ) to (B , A − B ).

Solution. 

(b)  Verify this combinatorial proof by giving an algebraic proof of this same fact.

Problem 3.  (a)  Now give a combinatorial proof of the following, more interesting theorem:

n2n−1  =

(1)

Hint: Let S  be the set of all length-n sequences of 0’s, 1’s and a single *. 
Solution.  Let P  ::= {0, . . . , n − 1} × {0, 1} n−1 . On the one hand, there is a bijection from P  to S by 
mapping (k , x) to the word obtained by inserting a * just after the kth bit in the length-n − 1 binary 
word, x.  So 
|S | = |P | = n2n−1 

(2) 

by the Product Rule. 
On  the  other  hand,  every  sequence  in  S  contains  between  1  and  n  nonzero  entries  since  the  ∗, 
�  � 
at  least,  is  nonzero.  The mapping  from  a  sequence  in  S  with  exactly  k  nonzero  entries  to  a  pair 
consisting  of  the  set  of  positions  of  the  nonzero  entries  and  the  position  of  the  *  among  these 
n � �� 
entries is a bijection, and the number of such pairs is  n
k  k by the Generalized Product Rule. Thus, 
by the Sum Rule: 
n 
k
k 
k=1 
Equating this expression and the expression (2) for |S | proves the theorem. 

|S | =

Solution.  By the Binomial Theorem 

(b)  Now prove (1) algebraically by applying the Binomial Theorem to (1 + x)n  and taking deriva­

Letting x = 1 in (3) yields (1).
