Problem 1. 
A certain company wants to have security for their computer systems.  So they have given every­
one a name and password. A length 10 word containing each of the characters: 

a, d, e, f, i, l, o, p, r, s, 

is called a cword. A password will be a cword which does not contain any of the subwords ”fails”, 
”failed”, or ”drop”. 
For example, the following two words are passwords: 

adeﬁloprs, srpolifeda, 

but the following three cwords are not: 

adropeﬂis, failedrops, dropefails. 

(a)  How many cwords contain the subword “drop”? 

(b)  How many cwords contain both “drop” and “fails”? 

(c)  Use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle to ﬁnd a simple formula for the number of passwords. 

Problem 2. 
Solve  the  following  counting  problems  by  deﬁning  an  appropriate mapping  (bijective  or  k-to-1) 
between a set whose size you know and the set in question. 

(a)  How many different ways are there to select a dozen donuts if four varieties are available? 

(b)  In  how many ways  can Mr.  and Mrs.  Grumperson  distribute  13  identical  pieces  of  coal  to 
their two —no, three! —children for Christmas? 

(c)  How many solutions over the nonnegative integers are there to the inequality: 

x1  + x2  + . . . + x10 

≤ 

100

(d)  We want  to  count  step-by-step  paths  between  points  in  the  plane with  integer  coordinates. 
Ony  two  kinds  of  step  are  allowed:  a  right-step which  increments  the  x  coordinate,  and  an  up-
step which increments the y coordinate.

(i)  How many paths are there from (0, 0) to (20, 30)? 
(ii)  How many paths are there from (0, 0) to (20, 30) that go through the point (10, 10)? 
(iii)  How many paths are  there  from  (0, 0)  to  (20, 30)  that do not go  through either of  the points 
(10, 10) and (15, 20)?

Hint:  Let  P  be  the  set  of  paths  from  (0, 0)  to  (20, 30),  N1  be  the  paths  in  P  that  go  through

(10, 10) and N2  be the paths in P  that go through (15, 20).

into n distinguishable urns with at most one ball in each urn?
