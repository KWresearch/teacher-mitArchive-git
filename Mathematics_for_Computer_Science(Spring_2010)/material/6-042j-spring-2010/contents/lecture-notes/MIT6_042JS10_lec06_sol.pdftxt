Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 3, Tue. 

Problem 1. 

Lemma 4.9.4. Let A be a set and b /∈ A.  If A is inﬁnite, then there is a bijection from A ∪ {b} to A. 

Proof.  Here’s how  to deﬁne  the bijection:  since A  is  inﬁnite,  it  certainly has at  least one element; 
call  it a0 .  But  since A  is  inﬁnite,  it has at  least  two  elements,  and one of  them must not be  equal 
to a0 ;  call this new element a1 .  But since A  is  inﬁnite,  it has at  least three elements, one of which 
must not equal a0  or a1 ; call this new element a2 . Continuing in the way, we conclude that there is 
an inﬁnite sequence a0 , a1 , a2 , . . . , an , . . .  of different elements of A. Now we can deﬁne a bijection 
f  : A ∪ {b} → A: 

f (b) ::= a0 , 
f (an ) ::= an+1 
f (a) ::= a 

for n ∈ N, 
for a ∈ A − {b, a0 , a1 , . . . } .

(a)  Several  students  felt  the proof of Lemma  4.9.4 was worrisome,  if not  circular.  What do you 
think? 

Solution.  There  is  no  “solution”  for  this  discussion  problem,  since  it  depends  on  what  seems

bothersome.

It may be bothersome that the proof asserts that f  is bijection without spelling out a proof. But the

bijection property really does follow directly from deﬁnition of f , so it shouldn’t be much burden

for a bothered reader to ﬁll in such a proof.

Another possibly bothersome point  is  that the proof assumes that  if a set  is  inﬁnite,  it must have

more than n elements, for every nonnegative integer n.  But really that’s the deﬁnition of inﬁnity:

a set  is ﬁnite  iff  it has n elements  for some nonnegative  integer, n,  and a set  is  inﬁnite  iff  it  is not

ﬁnite.

A  possibly worrisome  point  is  how  you  ﬁnd  an  element  an+1  ∈  A  given  a0 , a1 , . . . , an .  But  you

don’t  have  to  ﬁnd  a  speciﬁc  one:  there must  be  an  element  in A − {a0 , a1 , . . . , an} —so  just  pick

any one.  Actually,  the  justiﬁcation  for  this  step  is  the  set-theoretic Axiom of Choice described  in

�

the Notes chapter ﬁrst-order logic, and some logicians do consider it worrisome. 

(b)  Use  the  proof  of  Lemma  4.9.4  to  show  that  if  A  is  an  inﬁnite  set,  then  there  is  surjective 
function from A to N, that is, every inﬁnite set is “as big as” the set of nonnegative integers.

Solution.  By the proof of Lemma 4.9.4, there is an inﬁnite sequence a0 , a1 , a2 , . . . , an , . . .  of differ­

Problem 2. 
→
Let  R  :  A
B  be  a  binary  relation.  Use  an  arrow  counting  argument  to  prove  the  following 
generalization of the Mapping Rule: 
Lemma.  If R is a function, and X  ⊆ A, then 
|X | ≥ |X R| . 

Solution.  Proof.  The proof is virtually a repeat of the proof in the Appendix for the ﬁrst Mapping 
Rule. 
Since R is a function, the number of arrows whose starting point is an element of X  is at most the 
number of elements in X , That is, 

|X | ≥ #arrows from X . 

Also, each element of X R is, by deﬁnition, the endpoint of at least one arrow starting from X , so 
there must be at least as many arrows starting from X  as the number of elements of X R. That is, 
#arrows from X  ≥ |X R| . 
Combining these inequalities immediately implies that |X | ≥  |X R|. 
An alternative proof appeals to the original Mapping Rule: 
Proof.  Consider the relation R� whose domain is X , whose codomain is X R, and whose arrows are 
just the arrows of R that start from X .  (These arrows necessarily end in X R by deﬁnition of X R.) 
Since R  is  a  function, R�  will be one  too,  and by deﬁnition of X R,  the  relation R�  is  a  surjection. 
Hence the ﬁrst Mapping Rule implies that |X | ≥ |X R|.

Problem 3. 
Let A =  {a0 , a1 , . . . , an−1} be a set of size n, and B  =  {b0 , b1 , . . . , bm−1} a set of size m.  Prove that 
|A × B |  =  mn  by  deﬁning  a  simple  bijection  from  A × B  to  the  nonnegative  integers  from  0  to 
mn − 1. 

Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 3, Tue. 
Solution.  A bijection f  : A × B → {0, 1, . . . , mn − 1} can be deﬁned by the rule 
f (ak , bj ) ::= jn + k .

Problem 4. 
The rational numbers ﬁll in all the spaces between the integers, so a ﬁrst thought is that there must 
be more of them than the integers, but it’s not true.  In this problem you’ll show that there are the 
same number of nonnegative rational as nonnegative integers.  In short, the nonnegative rationals 
are countable. 
(a)  Describe a bijection between all the integers, Z, and the nonnegative integers, N. 

Solution.  One such bijection is deﬁned by lining up all the integers and the nonnegative integers 
as follows: 
0 1  −1 2  −2 3  −3 4 
. . . 
0 1

We can also deﬁne this bijection, f  : Z
Z+ , by a speciﬁcation rule 
−2n 
for n ≤ 0, 
f (n) =	
|n| − 1 
2 
for n > 0.

(b)  Deﬁne a bijection between the nonnegative integers and the set, N × N, of all the ordered pairs 
of nonnegative integers: 

(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), . . . 
(1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), . . . 
(2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), . . . 
(3.0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), . . . 
. . . 

Solution.  Line up all the pairs by following successive upper-right to lower-left diagonals along 
the top row. 
That  is,  start  with  (0,0)  which  counts  as  an  initial  diagonal  of  length  1.  Then  follow  the  length 
2  second diagonal  (0,1),  (1,0),  then  the  length  3  third diagonal  (0,2),  (1,1),  (2,0),  then  the  length  4 
fourth diagonal (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), (3,0), . . . .  So the line up would be 
(0, 0)  (0, 1)  (1, 0)  (0, 2)  (1, 1)  (2, 0)  (0, 3)  (1, 2)  (2, 1)  (3, 0) 
. . . 
0

2
3
4

. . . 
It’s interesting that this bijection from N × N to N has a simple formula:  the pair (k , m) is the kth 
element on the diagonal consisting of the pairs whose sum is k + m. The total number of elements 
in all the preceding diagonals is 
· · · 
0 + 1 + 2 +  + (k + m) = (k + m + 1)(k + m)/2
so the pair (k , m) appears as the (k + m + 1)(k + m)/2 + kth element in the line up.

(c)  Conclude that N is the same size as the set, Q, of all nonnegative rational numbers. 

Solution.  One way  to  line  up  the  nonnegative  rationals  is  to  take  the  list  of  all  pairs,  (k , m),  of 
integers  above  and  replace  each  remaining  pair  by  the  rational  number  k/m,  skipping  the  pairs 
where m = 0: 

0/1  0/2  1/1  1/2  0/3  1/2  2/1  0/3  1/2  2/1  . . . 

and, going from left to right, delete all the occurrences of numbers that are already in the list: 

0  1  1/2  2  3  1/3  1/4 . . . .
