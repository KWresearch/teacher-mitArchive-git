What is a Set? 
Informally:  
A set is a collection of mathematical 
objects, with the collection treated 
as a single mathematical object. 
(This is circular of course: 
           what’s a collection?)

Some sets 
{7, “Albert R.”, π/2, T} 
A set with 4 elements: two 
numbers, a string, and a Boolean. 
Same as 
      {T, “Albert R.”, 7, π/2} 
-- order doesn’t matter

Membership 
x ∈ A 
x is a member of A: 
  π/2 ∈ {7, “Albert R.”, π/2, T} 
  π/3 ∉ {7, “Albert R.”, π/2, T} 
14/2 ∈ {7, “Albert R.”, π/2, T} 

Synonyms for Membership 
x ∈ A 
x is an element of A 
x is in A 
Examples: 
7∈Z,  2/3 ∉ Z,  Z ∈pow(R)

In or Not In 

An element is in or not in a set: 
  {7, π/2, 7} is same as {7, π/2} 
(No notion of being in the set  
 more than once) 

Subset (⊆) 
A is a subset of B 
A⊆B 
A is contained in B 
Every element of A is also 
an element of B: 
∀x [x∈A  IMPLIES  x∈B]

A set-theoretic equality 
A(cid:747)(B(cid:748)C) = (A(cid:747)B)(cid:748)(A(cid:747)C) 
proof:  Show these have the same 
elements, namely, 
x∈ Left Hand Set  iff  x∈ RHS 
 for all x. 

A set-theoretic equality 
A(cid:747)(B(cid:748)C) = (A(cid:747)B)(cid:748)(A(cid:747)C) 
proof uses fact from last time: 
   P OR (Q AND R)  equiv 
     (P OR Q) AND (P OR R)

A set-theoretic equality

proof:  x∈A(cid:747)(B(cid:748)C)               iff 
x∈A OR x∈(B(cid:748)C)       (def of (cid:747)) iff 
x∈A OR (x∈B AND x∈C)  (def (cid:748)) iff
