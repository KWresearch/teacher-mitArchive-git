Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 2, Fri. 

Problem 1. 
Set Formulas and Propositional Formulas. 
(a)  Verify that the propositional formula (P  AND  NOT(Q))  OR  (P  AND  Q) is equivalent to P . 

Solution.  There is a simple veriﬁcation by truth table with 4 rows which we omit. 
There  is  also  a  simple  cases  argument:  if Q  is T,  then  the  formula  simpliﬁes  to  (P  AND  F)  OR 
(P  AND  T) which further simpliﬁes to (F  OR  P ) which is equivalent to P . 
Otherwise, if Q is F, then the formula simpliﬁes to (P  AND  T)  OR  (P  AND  F) which is likewise 
� 
equivalent to P . 

(b)  Use part (a) to prove that 

for any sets, A, B , where 

A = (A − B ) ∪ (A ∩ B ) 

A − B ::= {a ∈ A | a /∈ B } . 

Solution.  We need only show that the two sets have the same elements, that is x is in one set iff x 
is in the other set, for any x. 
Let P  be x ∈ A and Q be x ∈ B . Then 
x ∈ (A − B ) ∪ (A ∩ B ) 
iff  x ∈ (A − B )  OR  x ∈ (A ∩ B ) 
iff  (x ∈ A  AND  NOT(x ∈ B ))  OR  (x ∈ A  AND  x ∈ B ) 
iff  (P  AND  NOT(Q))  OR  (P  AND  Q) 
iff  P 
iff  x ∈ A 

(by def of ∪) 
(by def of ∩ and −) 
(by def of P  and Q) 
(by part (a))

Subset take-away1  is a two player game involving a ﬁxed ﬁnite set, A.  Players alternately choose 
nonempty subsets of A with the conditions that a player may not choose

•  any set containing a set that was named earlier. 

The ﬁrst player who is unable to move loses the game. 
For example,  if A is {1},  then there are no legal moves and the second player wins.  If A is {1, 2}, 
then the only legal moves are {1} and {2}. Each is a good reply to the other, and so once again the 
second player wins. 
The ﬁrst interesting case is when A has three elements.  This time, if the ﬁrst player picks a subset 
with  one  element,  the  second  player  picks  the  subset  with  the  other  two  elements.  If  the  ﬁrst 
player picks a  subset with  two elements,  the  second player picks  the  subset whose  sole member 
is the third element.  Both cases produce positions equivalent to the starting position when A has 
two elements, and thus leads to a win for the second player. 
Verify that when A has four elements, the second player still has a winning strategy.2 

Solution.  There are way too many cases to work out by hand if we tried to list all possible games. 
But the elements of A all behave the same, so we can cut to a small number of cases using the fact 
that permuting around  the  elements of A  in any game yields another possible game.  We  can do 
this by not mentioning speciﬁc elements of A, but instead using the variables a, b, c, d whose values 
will be the four elements of A. 
We consider two cases for the move of the Player 1 when the game starts: 

1.  Player 1 chooses a one element or a  three element subset.  Then Player 2 should choose  the 
complement of Player one’s choice.  The game then becomes the same as playing the n  = 3 
game  on  the  three  element  set  chosen  in  this  ﬁrst  round,  where  we  know  Player  2  has  a 
winning strategy. 

2.  Player 1 chooses a subset of 2 elements.  Let a, b be  these elements,  that  is,  the ﬁrst move  is 
{a, b}. Player 2 should choose the complement, {c, d}, of Player 1’s choice. We then have the 
following subcases: 
(a)  Player 1’s second move  is a one element subset,  {a}.  Player 2 should choose {b}.  The 
game is then reduced to the two element game on {c, d} where Player 2 has a winning 
strategy. 
(b)  Player 1’s second move is a two element subset, {a, c}. Player 2 should choose its com­
plement, {b, d}. This leads to two subsubcases: 
i.  Player 1’s third move is one of the remaining sets of size two, {a, d}. Player 2 should 
choose  its  complement,  {b, c}.  The  remaining  possible moves  are  the  four  sets  of 
size 1, where the Player 2 clearly wins after two more rounds. 
ii.  Player  1’s  third move  is  a  one  element  set,  {a}.  Player  2  should  choose  {b}.  The 
game is then reduced to the case two element game on {c, d} where Player 2 has a 
winning strategy. 

So in all cases, Player 2 has a winning strategy in the Gale game for n = 4.

2David Gale worked out some of the properties of this game and conjectured that the second player wins the game 
for any set A. This remains an open problem.

Problem 3. 
Deﬁne a surjection relation, surj, on sets by the rule


Deﬁnition.  A surj B  iff there is a surjective function from A to B .


Deﬁne the injection relation, inj, on sets by the rule


Deﬁnition.  A  inj B  iff there is a total injective relation from A to B .


(a)  Prove that if A surj B  and B  surj C , then A surj C .

B  and G  : B
Solution.  By deﬁnition of surj, there are surjective functions, F  : A
◦ 
Let H  ::= G F  be the function equal to the composition of G and F , that is

C .

H (a) ::= G(F (a)). 
We show  that H  is surjective, which will complete  the proof.  So suppose c  ∈  C .  Then since G  is 
a surjection, c = G(b) for some b  ∈ B .  Likewise, b =  F (a) for some a  ∈ A.  Hence c = G(F (a)) =

H (a), proving that c is in the range of H , as required. 

(b)  Explain why A surj B  iff B  inj A. 

Solution.  Proof.  (right  to  left):  By deﬁnition  of  inj,  there  is  a  total  injective  relation, R  :  B
But this implies that R−1  is a surjective function from A to B . 
(left to right):  By deﬁnition of surj, there is a surjective function, F  : A
F −1  is a total injective relation from A to B .

(c)  Conclude from (a) and (b) that if A  inj B  and B  inj C , then A  inj C . 

Solution.  From  (b) and  (a) we have  that  if C  inj  B  and B  inj  A,  then C  inj  A,  so  just  switch  the

names A and C .
