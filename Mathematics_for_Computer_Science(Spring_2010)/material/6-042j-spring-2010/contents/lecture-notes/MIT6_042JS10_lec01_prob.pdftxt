Problem 1. 
Identify exactly where the bugs are in each of the following bogus proofs.1 

(a)  Bogus Claim:  1/8 > 1/4. 

Bogus proof. 

3 > 2 
3 log10 (1/2) > 2 log10 (1/2) 
log10 (1/2)3  >  log10 (1/2)2 
(1/2)3  > (1/2)2 , 

and the claim now follows by the rules for multiplying fractions. 
(b)  Bogus proof :  1¢ = $0.01 = ($0.1)2  = (10¢)2  = 100¢ = $1.  � 
(c)  Bogus Claim:  If a and b are two equal real numbers, then a = 0. 

Bogus proof.

a 2 
a 2  − b2 
(a − b)(a + b) 
a + b

Problem 2. 
It’s a fact that the Arithmetic Mean is at least as large the Geometric Mean, namely, 
a + b  √
≥ 
2 

ab

for all nonnegative real numbers a and b. But there’s something objectionable about the following 
proof of this fact. What’s the objection, and how would you ﬁx it? 

Bogus proof. 

√
a + b 
? ≥ 
ab, 
2 
√
? ≥ 2
a + b 
ab, 
a 2  + 2ab + b2  ? ≥ 4ab, 
a 2  − 2ab + b2  ? ≥ 0, 
(a − b)2  ≥ 0 

so 

so 

so 

so 
which we know is true. 

The last statement is true because a − b is a real number, and the square of a real number is never 
� 
negative. This proves the claim. 

Problem 3. 
Albert announces that he plans a surprise 6.042 quiz next week.  His students wonder  if the quiz 
could be next Friday. The students realize that it obviously cannot, because if it hadn’t been given 
before  Friday,  everyone  would  know  that  there  was  only  Friday  left  on  which  to  give  it,  so  it 
wouldn’t be a surprise any more. 
So the students ask whether Albert could give the surprise quiz Thursday? They observe that if the 
quiz wasn’t given before Thursday,  it would have to be given on the Thursday, since they already 
know  it  can’t  be  given  on  Friday.  But  having  ﬁgured  that  out,  it  wouldn’t  be  a  surprise  if  the 
quiz was on Thursday either.  Similarly, the students reason that the quiz can’t be on Wednesday, 
Tuesday, or Monday.  Namely, it’s impossible for Albert to give a surprise quiz next week.  All the 
students now relax, having concluded that Albert must have been blufﬁng. 
And since no one expects the quiz, that’s why, when Albert gives it on Tuesday next week, it really 
is a surprise! 
What do you think is wrong with the students’ reasoning?
