Problem 1. 
Solve the following problems using the pigeonhole principle. For each problem, try to identify the 
pigeons, the pigeonholes, and a rule assigning each pigeon to a pigeonhole. 

(a)  Every MIT ID number starts with a 9 (we think). Suppose that each of the 75 students in 6.042 
sums  the  nine  digits  of  his  or  her  ID  number.  Explain why  two  people must  arrive  at  the  same 
sum. 

(b)  In every set of 100 integers, there exist two whose difference is a multiple of 37. 
√
(c)  For any ﬁve points inside a unit square (not on the boundary), there are two points at distance 
2. 
less than 1/
(d)  Show that if n + 1 numbers are selected from {1, 2, 3, . . . , 2n},  two must be consecutive,  that 
is, equal to k and k + 1 for some k . 

Problem 2. 
Answer the following quesions using the Generalized Product Rule. 

(a)  Next week, I’m going to get really ﬁt! On day 1, I’ll exercise for 5 minutes. On each subsequent 
day,  I’ll  exercise  0,  1,  2,  or  3  minutes  more  than  the  previous  day.  For  example,  the  number  of 
minutes  that  I  exercise  on  the  seven  days  of  next week might  be  5,  6,  9,  9,  9,  11,  12.  How many 
such sequences are possible? 

(b)  An r-permutation of a set is a sequence of r distinct elements of that set.  For example, here are 
all the 2-permutations of {a, b, c, d}: 

(a, b)
(b, a)
(c, a)
(d, a)

(a, c)
(b, c)
(c, b)
(d, b)

(a, d) 
(b, d) 
(c, d) 
(d, c) 

How  many  r-permutations  of  an  n-element  set  are  there?  Express  your  answer  using  factorial 
notation. 
(c)  How many n × n matrices are there with distinct entries drawn from {1, . . . , p}, where p ≥ n2 ?

Problem 3. 
Your 6.006 tutorial has 12 students, who are supposed to break up into 4 groups of 3 students each. 
Your TA has observed that the students waste too much time trying to form balanced groups, so 
he decided to pre-assign students to groups and email the group assignments to his students. 

(a)  Your  TA  has  a  list  of  the  12  students  in  front  of  him,  so  he  divides  the  list  into  consecutive 
groups of 3.  For example,  if  the  list  is ABCDEFGHIJKL,  the TA would deﬁne a sequence of  four 
groups  to  be  ({A, B , C } , {D , E , F } , {G, H, I } , {J, K, L}).  This way  of  forming  groups  deﬁnes  a 
mapping from a list of twelve students to a sequence of four groups.  This is a k-to-1 mapping for 
what k? 

(b)  A  group  assignment  speciﬁes  which  students  are  in  the  same  group,  but  not  any  order  in 
which the groups should be listed.  If we map a sequence of 4 groups, 
({A, B , C } , {D , E , F } , {G, H, I } , {J, K, L}), 

into a group assignment 

{{A, B , C } , {D , E , F } , {G, H, I } , {J, K, L}} , 

this mapping is j -to-1 for what j ? 

(c)  How many group assignments are possible? 

(d)  In how many ways can 3n students be broken up into n groups of 3? 

Problem 4. 
A pizza house is having a promotional sale. Their commercial reads: 

We  offer  9  different  toppings  for  your  pizza!  Buy  3  large  pizzas  at  the  regular  price, 
and you can get each one with as many different toppings as you wish, absolutely free. 
That’s 22, 369, 621 different ways to choose your pizzas! 

The ad writer was a former Harvard student who had evaluated the formula (29 )3/3! on his calcu­
lator and gotten close to 22, 369, 621. Unfortunately, (29 )3/3! is obviously not an integer, so clearly 
something  is  wrong.  What  mistaken  reasoning  might  have  led  the  ad  writer  to  this  formula? 
Explain how to ﬁx the mistake and get a correct formula.
