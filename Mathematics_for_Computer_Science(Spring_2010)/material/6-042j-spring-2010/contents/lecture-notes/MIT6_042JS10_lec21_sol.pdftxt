Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 8, Mon. 

Problem 1. 
A number is perfect if it is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, other than itself.  For example, 
6 is perfect, because 6 = 1 + 2 + 3.  Similarly, 28 is perfect, because 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. Explain 
why 2k−1 (2k  − 1) is perfect when 2k  − 1 is prime.1 

Solution.  If 2k  − 1 is prime, then the only divisors of 2k−1 (2k  − 1) are: 

1,  2,  4, 

. . . ,  2k−1 , 

and 

1  (2k  − 1),  2  (2k  − 1),  4  (2k  − 1), 
·
·
· 

. . . ,  2k−2  (2k  − 1). 
·

(2)

The  sequence  (1)  sums  to  2k  − 1  (using  the  formula  for  a  geometric  series,2  and  likewise  the  se­
quence (2) sums to (2k−1 − 1)  (2k − 1). Adding these two sums gives 2k−1 (2k − 1), so the number

is perfect. 

Problem 2.  (a)  Use the Pulverizer to ﬁnd integers x, y such that 

·
· 
x  50 + y  21 = gcd(50, 21).

1Euclid proved  this 2300 years ago.  About 250 years ago, Euler proved  the converse:  every even perfect number  is 
of this form (for a simple proof see http://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/EvenPerfect.html). As is typical 
in number theory, apparently simple results  lie at the brink of the unknown.  For example,  it  is not known  if there are 
an inﬁnite number of even perfect numbers or any odd perfect numbers at all. 
2 It’s fun to notice the “Computer Science” proof that (1) sums to 2k  − 1.  The binary binary representation of 2j  is a 
10j , so the sum is represented by 1k . This what you get by subtracting 1 from by 10k  which is the binary representation 
of 2k .

Solution.  since  (x, y)  =  (8, −19) works,  so  does  (8 − 21n, −19 + 50n)  for  any  n  ∈  Z,  so  letting 
n = 1, we have

Problem 3. 
For nonzero integers, a, b, prove the following properties of divisibility and GCD’S. (You may use 
the fact that gcd(a, b) is an integer linear combination of a and b. You may not appeal to uniqueness 
of prime factorization because the properties below are needed to prove unique factorization.) 

(a)  Every common divisor of a and b divides gcd(a, b). 

Solution.  For some s and t, gcd(a, b) =  sa + tb.  Let c be a common divisor of a and b.  Since c  |  a 
and c | b, we have a = kc, b = k � c so 
sa + tb = skc + tk � c = c(sk + tk � ) 

so c | sa + tb. 

(b)  If a | bc and gcd(a, b) = 1, then a  | c.

Solution.  Since gcd(a, b) = 1, we have sa + tb = 1 for some s, t. Multiplying by c, we have 

sac + tbc = c 
but a divides the second term of the sum since a  |  bc, and it obviously divides the ﬁrst term, and 
therefore it divides the sum, which equals c. 

� 

(c)  If p | ab for some prime, p, then p | a or p | b. 

Solution.  If p does not divide a, then since p is prime, gcd(p, a) = 1. By part (b), we conclude that 
p  | b. 
� 

(d)  Let m be  the  smallest  integer  linear  combination  of  a  and  b  that  is positive.  Show  that m  = 
gcd(a, b). 

Solution.  Since gcd(a, b) is positive and an integer linear common of a and b, we have 
m ≤ gcd(a, b). 

On  the  other  hand,  since m  is  a  linear  combination  of  a  and  b,  every  common  factor  of  a  and  b 
divides m.  So in particular, gcd(a, b) | m, which implies 
gcd(a, b) ≤ m.

Appendix: The Pulverizer 

Euclid’s algorithm for ﬁnding the GCD of two numbers relies on repeated application of the equa­
tion: 

gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, rem(a, b)) 

For example, we can compute the GCD of 259 and 70 as follows: 

gcd(259, 70)  =  gcd(70, 49) 
=  gcd(49, 21) 
=  gcd(21, 7) 
=  gcd(7, 0) 
= 7. 

since rem(259, 70) = 49 
since rem(70, 49) = 21 
since rem(49, 21) = 7 
since rem(21, 7) = 0 

The Pulverizer goes through the same steps, but requires some extra bookkeeping along the way: 
as we compute gcd(a, b), we keep track of how to write each of the remainders (49, 21, and 7, in the 
example) as a  linear combination of a and b  (this  is worthwhile, because our objective  is  to write 

4

the  last  nonzero  remainder,  which  is  the GCD,  as  such  a  linear  combination).  For  our  example, 
here is this extra bookkeeping:

21  =  70 − 1 · 49 
=  70 − 1 · (259 − 3 · 70) 
=  −1 · 259 + 4 · 70 
7  =  49 − 2 · 21 
=  (259 − 3 · 70) − 2 · (−1 · 259 + 4 · 70) 
=  3 · 259 − 11 · 70

We began by initializing two variables, x = a and y = b.  In the ﬁrst two columns above, we carried 
out  Euclid’s  algorithm.  At  each  step,  we  computed  rem(x, y),  which  can  be written  in  the  form 
x − q y .  (Remember that the Division Algorithm says x = q y + r , where r  is the remainder. We 
·
· 
get r = x − q y by rearranging terms.) Then we replaced x and y in this equation with equivalent 
· 
linear combinations of a and b, which we already had computed.  After simplifying, we were left 
with a linear combination of a and b that was equal to the remainder as desired. The ﬁnal solution 
is boxed.
