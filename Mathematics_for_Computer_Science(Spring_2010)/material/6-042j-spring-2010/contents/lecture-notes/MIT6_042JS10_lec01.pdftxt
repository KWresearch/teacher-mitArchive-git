1 = -1 ? 
pictures are not the only 
source of false proofs   

Moral:  
1.   Calculation is a risky substitute for    
 understanding.     
2.   Be sure you know the rules. 

Consequences of  1= -1 
½ = -½    (multiply by ½) 
 2 = 1          (add     ) 
“Since I and the Pope are clearly 2,    
  we conclude that I and the Pope are 1. 
  That is, I am the Pope.”
