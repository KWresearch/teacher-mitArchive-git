In-Class Problems Week 6, Fri. 

Problem 1. 
Prove that a graph is a tree iff it has a unique simple path between any two vertices. 

Problem 2. 
The  n-dimensional  hypercube,  Hn ,  is  a  graph whose  vertices  are  the  binary  strings  of  length  n. 
Two vertices are adjacent if and only if they differ in exactly 1 bit. For example, in H3 , vertices 111 
and 011 are adjacent because  they differ only  in  the ﬁrst bit, while vertices 101 and 011 are not 
adjacent because they differ at both the ﬁrst and second bits. 

(a)  Prove that it is impossible to ﬁnd two spanning trees of H3  that do not share some edge. 
(b)  Verify  that  for  any  two  vertices  x  =�
y  of H3 ,  there  are  3  paths  from  x  to  y  in H3 ,  such  that, 
besides x and y , no two of those paths have a vertex in common. 

(c)  Conclude that the connectivity of H3  is 3. 
(d)  Try extending your reasoning to H4 .  (In fact, the connectivity of Hn  is n for all n ≥ 1. A proof 
appears in the problem solution.)
