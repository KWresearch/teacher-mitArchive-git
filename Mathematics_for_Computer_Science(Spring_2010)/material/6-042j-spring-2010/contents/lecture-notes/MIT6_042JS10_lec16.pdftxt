A simple graph: 

A Simple Graph 

edge

Definition:
A simple graph G consists of 
•a nonempty set, V, of vertices
•a set, E, of edges
(edge = set of 2 vertices) 

vertices, V
undirected edges, E

::= { , }

“adjacent ”

Vertex degree 

Vertex degree 

degree of a vertex is 
# of incident edges 

deg( ) = 2 

degree of a vertex is 
# of incident edges 

deg( ) = 4

Is there a graph with 
vertex degrees 2,2,1? 

NO!

Handshaking Lemma
sum of degrees is 
twice # edges 

Proof: Each edge contributes 
          2 to the sum on the right

Handshaking Lemma
sum of degrees is 
twice # edges 

2+2+1 = odd, 
so impossible

Sex in America: Men more Promiscuous? 

Study claims: 
Men average many more
partners than women. 
Graph theory shows 
this is nonsense

Averages differ solely by 
ratio of females to males.
No big difference 
Nothing to do with promiscuity

The Graph Abstraction 
All that matters 
are the connections:
graphs with the 
same connections 
are isomorphic

Isomorphism
two graphs are isomorphic
 when there is an
edge-preserving
matching
of their vertices. 

Albert R Meyer, March 10, 2010

Are these isomorphic?

G1 isomorphic to G2 means
edge-preserving vertex matching:

 bijection f:V1 (cid:1) V2 with 
u—v in E1
iff f(u)—f(v) in E2

Nonisomorphism

Proving nonisomorphism

If some property preserved by
isomorphism differs for two
graphs, then they’re not isomorphic: 
•  # of nodes, 
•  # of edges, 
• degree distributions, ….

degree 2

all degree 3

Finding an isomorphism? 

Are these two graphs isomorphic? 

many possible mappings: large search 
can use properties preserved by
isomorphisms as a guide, for example: 
• a deg 4 vertex adjacent to a deg 3 
    can only match with 
• a deg 4 vertex also adjacent to a deg 3 
but even so… 

...nothing known is sure to be 
much faster than searching thru 
all bijections for an isomorphism

Connectedness
two vertices are connected
iff there is a path from one
to the other.
a graph is connected iff every 
two vertices are connected.
