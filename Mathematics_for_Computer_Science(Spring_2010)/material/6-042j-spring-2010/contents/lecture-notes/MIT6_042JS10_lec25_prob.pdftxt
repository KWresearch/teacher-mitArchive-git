Problem 1. 
Recall that for functions f , g on N, f  = O(g) iff 
∃c ∈ N ∃n0  ∈ N ∀n ≥ n0  c · g(n) ≥ |f (n)| . 

(1) 

For  each  pair  of  functions  below,  determine whether  f  =  O(g)  and whether  g  =  O(f ).  In  cases 
where one function is O() of the other, indicate the smallest nonegative integer, c, and for that small­
est c, the smallest corresponding nonegative integer n0  ensuring that condition (1) applies. 

(a)  f (n) = n2 , g(n) = 3n.

Problem 2. 

(a)  Deﬁne a function f (n) such that f  = Θ(n2 ) and NO T(f  ∼ n2 ). 
(b)  Deﬁne a function g(n) such that g = O(n2 ), g  �= Θ(n2 ) and g  �= o(n2 ). 

Problem 3. 

False Claim. 

2n  = O(1). 

(2) 

Explain why the claim is false. Then identify and explain the mistake in the following bogus proof.

Bogus proof.  The proof by induction on n where the induction hypothesis, P (n), is the assertion (2).

base case: P (0) holds trivially.

inductive step: We may assume P (n), so there is a constant c > 0 such that 2n  ≤ c  1. Therefore,

· 
2n+1  = 2  2n  ≤ (2c) 1,
·
· 

which implies that 2n+1  = O(1). That is, P (n+1) holds, which completes the proof of the inductive 
step. 
We  conclude by  induction  that 2n  =  O(1)  for all n.  That  is,  the exponential  function  is bounded 
by a constant.

Problem 4. 
Give an elementary proof (without appealing to Stirling’s formula) that log(n!) = Θ(n log n). 

Asymptotic Notations 

Let f , g be functions from R to R. 

iff 

limx→∞ f (x)/g(x) = 1. 

•	 f  is asymptotically equal to g :  f (x) ∼ g(x) 
limx→∞ f (x)/g(x) = 0. 
•	 f  is asymptotically smaller than g :  f (x) = o(g(x)) 
iff 
lim supx→∞ f (x)/g(x) < ∞, where

•	 for f , g nonnegative,  f  = O(g) 
iff 
lim supx→∞ h(x) ::= limx→∞  luby≥xh(y).

An alternative, equivalent, deﬁnition is

iff  ∃c, x0  ∈ R+ ∀x ≥ x0 . f (x) ≤ cg(x). 

f  = O(g) 

•	 Finally, f  = Θ(g) 

iff  f  = O(g) AND g = O(f ).
