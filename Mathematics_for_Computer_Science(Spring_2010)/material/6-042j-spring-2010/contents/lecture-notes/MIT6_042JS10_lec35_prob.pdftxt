Problem 1. 
Suppose there is a system with n components, and we know from past experience that any partic­
ular component will fail in a given year with probability p. That is, letting Fi  be the event that the 
ith component fails within one year, we have 
Pr {Fi} = p 
for  1  ≤  i  ≤  n.  The  system will  fail  if  any  one of  its  components  fails.  What  can we  say  about  the 
probability that the system will fail within one year? 

Let  F  be  the  event  that  the  system  fails  within  one  year.  Without  any  additional  assumptions, 
we can’t get an exact answer  for Pr {F }.  However, we can give useful upper and  lower bounds, 
namely, 

p ≤ Pr {F } ≤ np. 

(1) 

We  may  as  well  assume  p <  1/n,  since  the  upper  bound  is  trivial  otherwise.  For  example,  if 
n  =  100  and  p  =  10−5 ,  we  conclude  that  there  is  at  most  one  chance  in  1000  of  system  failure 
within a year and at least one chance in 100,000. 
Let’s model this situation with the sample space S ::= P ({1, . . . , n}) whose outcomes are subsets of 
positive integers ≤ n, where s ∈ S  corresponds to the indices of exactly those components that fail 
within one year.  For  example,  {2, 5}  is  the  outcome  that  the  second  and ﬁfth  components  failed 
within  a  year  and  none  of  the  other  components  failed.  So  the  outcome  that  the  system did  not 
fail corresponds to the emptyset, ∅. 

(a)  Show that the probability that the system fails could be as small as p by describing appropriate 
probabilities for the outcomes.  Make sure to verify that the sum of your outcome probabilities is 
1. 

(b)  Show that the probability that the system fails could actually be as large as np by describing 
appropriate  probabilities  for  the  outcomes.  Make  sure  to  verify  that  the  sum  of  your  outcome 
probabilities is 1. 

(c)  Prove inequality (1). 

(d)  Describe probabilities for the outcomes so that the component failures are mutually indepen­
dent.

Team 1: 

In-Class Problems Week 13, Mon. 

Guess the Bigger Number Game 

•  Write different integers between 0 and 7 on two pieces of paper. 

•  Put the papers face down on a table. 

Team 2: 

•  Turn over one paper and look at the number on it. 

•  Either stick with this number or switch to the unseen other number. 

Team 2 wins if it chooses the larger number. 

Problem 2. 
In  section  20.2.3,  Team  2 was  shown  to have  a  strategy  that wins  4/7 of  the  time no matter how 
Team  1  plays.  Can  Team  2  do  better?  The  answer  is  “no,”  because  Team  1  has  a  strategy  that 
guarantees  that  it  wins  at  least  3/7  of  the  time,  no  matter  how  Team  2  plays.  Describe  such  a 
strategy for Team 1 and explain why it works. 

Problem 3. 
Suppose X1 , X2 , and X3  are three mutually independent random variables, each having the uni­
form distribution 
Pr {Xi  = k}  equal to 1/3 for each of k = 1, 2, 3. 
Let M  be another random variable giving the maximum of these three random variables. What is 
the density function of M ? 

Problem 4. 
Suppose you have a biased coin  that has probability p of ﬂipping heads.  Let J  be  the number of 
�  � 
heads in n independent coin ﬂips.  So J  has the general binomial distribution: 
p k q n−k 
n
k 

PDFJ (k) = 

where q ::= 1 − p. 
(a)  Show that 

PDFJ (k) < PDFJ (k + 1) 
PDFJ (k) > PDFJ (k + 1) 

for k < np + p,

for k > np + p.

(b)  Conclude that the maximum value of PDFJ  is asymptotically equal to 
√

1 
.
2πnpq 
Hint:  For the asymptotic estimate,  it’s ok to assume that np  is an  integer, so by part (a) the maxi­
� �n √
mum value is PDFJ (np). Use Stirling’s formula 15.12: 
n 
n! ∼
