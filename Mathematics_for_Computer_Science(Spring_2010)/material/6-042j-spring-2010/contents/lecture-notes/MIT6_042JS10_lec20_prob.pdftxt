(a)  For each picture, describe its discrete faces (simple cycles that deﬁne the region borders). 

(b)  Which of the pictured graphs are  isomorphic?  Which pictures represent the same planar em­
bedding?  – that is, they have the same discrete faces. 

(c)  Describe  a  way  to  construct  the  embedding  in  Figure  4  according  to  the  recursive  Deﬁni­
tion 12.3.1 of planar embedding.  For each application of a constructor rule, be sure to indicate the 
faces (cycles) to which the rule was applied and the cycles which result from the application. 

Problem 2. 
Prove the following assertions by structural induction on the deﬁnition of planar embedding. 

(a)  In a planar embedding of a graph, each edge is traversed a total of two times by the faces of 
the embedding. 

(b)  In a planar embedding of a connected graph with at least three vertices, each face is of length 
at least three. 

Problem 3.  (a)  Show  that  if  a  connected  planar  graph  with  more  than  two  vertices  is  bipartite, 
then 
e ≤ 2v − 4.	
Hint:  Similar to the proof that e ≤ 3v − 6. Use Problem 2. 
(b)  Conclude  that  that K3,3  is not planar.  (K3,3  is  the  graph with  six  vertices  and  an  edge  from 
each of the ﬁrst three vertices to each of the last three.)

Deﬁnition 3.1.  A planar embedding of a connected graph consists of a nonempty set of cycles of the 
graph  called  the  discrete  faces  of  the  embedding.  Planar  embeddings  are  deﬁned  recursively  as 
follows: 

•	 Base case:  If G is a graph consisting of a single vertex, v , then a planar embedding of G has 
one discrete face, namely the length zero cycle, v . 

•	 Constructor Case:  (split a  face) Suppose G  is a connected graph with a planar embedding, 
and  suppose  a  and  b  are  distinct,  nonadjacent  vertices  of  G  that  appear  on  some  discrete 
face, γ , of the planar embedding. That is, γ  is a cycle of the form 
· · · 
a . . . b 
a.

Then the graph obtained by adding the edge a—b to the edges of G has a planar embedding 
with the same discrete faces as G, except that face γ  is replaced by the two discrete faces1

as illustrated in Figure 1. 

•	 Constructor Case:  (add a bridge) Suppose G and H  are connected graphs with planar em-
beddings and disjoint sets of vertices. Let a be a vertex on a discrete face, γ , in the embedding 
of G. That is, γ  is of the form 

a . . . a. 

Similarly, let b be a vertex on a discrete face, δ , in the embedding of H , so δ  is of the form 
· · · 
b 
b.

Then  the  graph  obtained  by  connecting G  and H  with  a  new  edge,  a—b,  has  a  planar  em­
bedding whose discrete faces are the union of the discrete faces of G and H , except that faces 
γ  and δ are replaced by one new face 

as illustrated in Figure 2.

An arbitrary graph is planar iff each of its connected components has a planar embedding. 

Theorem 3.2 (Euler ’s Formula).  If a connected graph has a planar embedding, then 
v − e + f  = 2 

where v  is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f  is the number of faces. 

1  There  is  one  exception  to  this  rule.  If G  is  a  line graph beginning with  a  and  ending with  b,  then  the  cycles  into 
which γ splits are actually the same. That’s because adding edge a—b creates a simple cycle graph, Cn , that divides the 
plane  into an “inner ” and an “outer ”  region with  the same border.  In order  to maintain  the correspondence between 
continuous  faces  and  discrete  faces,  we  have  to  allow  two  “copies”  of  this  same  cycle  to  count  as  discrete  faces.  But 
since  this  is  the  only  situation  in which  two  faces  are  actually  the  same  cycle,  this  exception  is  better  explained  in  a 
footnote than mentioned explicitly in the deﬁnition.

Figure 2: The Add Bridge Case. 

Corollary 3.3.  Suppose a connected planar graph has v ≥ 3 vertices and e edges. Then 
e ≤ 3v − 6. 

Proof.  By  deﬁnition,  a  connected  graph  is  planar  iff  it  has  a  planar  embedding.  So  suppose  a 
connected graph with v vertices and e edges has a planar embedding with f  faces. By Problem 2.a, 
every edge is traversed exactly twice by the face boundaries.  So the sum of the lengths of the face 
boundaries is exactly 2e. Also by Problem 2.b, when v ≥ 3, each face boundary is of length at least 
three, so this sum is at least 3f . This implies that 
3f  ≤ 2e. 
But f  = e − v + 2 by Euler ’s formula, and substituting into (2) gives 
3(e − v + 2) ≤ 2e 
e − 3v + 6 ≤ 0 
e ≤ 3v − 6

Corollary 3.4.  K5  is not planar. 

Proof. 

e = 10 > 9 = 3v − 6.
