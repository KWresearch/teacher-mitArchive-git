A Magic Trick 

Assistant’s Choices 

Let’s do it! 

Decide the order of the 4 cards: 
4! = 24 orderings 
-- but 48 cards remain
Decide which 4 cards to list

How will A & M
learn any matching this big? 
Here’s how:

lec 10W.13 

Among 5 cards chosen: 
at least 2 have the same suit
(Pigeonhole Principle)
A lists one of them 1st

Aha!  The first card has the 
same suit as the hidden card!

Magic Trick Revealed (II) 

How does M figure out the 
rank of the hidden card?

Aha!  Look at the order 
of the other 3 cards! 

Magic Trick Revealed (II) 
Fix ordering of the deck 
A(cid:3) < A(cid:5) < A(cid:4) < A(cid:2) < 
2(cid:3) < 2(cid:5) < 2(cid:4) < 2(cid:2) <

Possible orders for the 
    remaining 3 cards: 

{ SML, SLM, MSL, MLS, LSM, LMS } 

Wait! Only have 6 sequences 
  of the remaining 3 cards, 
  but 12 possible hidden cards 
  of the known suit! 
Oftwo cards with the same suit, 
choosingwhich to reveal can give 1
more bit of information!

• The first card determines the 
hidden suit ((cid:2) (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:3)) .
• Hidden rank (A … K) 
= first-card rank + offset ( 6).
• Offset given by order of 
remaining 3 cards: 

SML = 1, SLM = 2, MSL = 3, 
MLS = 4, LSM = 5, LMS = 6.
