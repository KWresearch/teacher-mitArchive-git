Problem 1. 
A certain company wants to have security for their computer systems.  So they have given every­
one a name and password. A length 10 word containing each of the characters: 

a, d, e, f, i, l, o, p, r, s, 

is called a cword. A password will be a cword which does not contain any of the subwords ”fails”, 
”failed”, or ”drop”. 
For example, the following two words are passwords: 

adeﬁloprs, srpolifeda, 

but the following three cwords are not: 

adropeﬂis, failedrops, dropefails. 
(a)  How many cwords contain the subword “drop”? 

Solution.  Such  cwords  are  obtainable  by  taking  the word  “drop”  and  the  remaining  6  letters  in 
� 
any order. There are 7! permutations of these 7 items. 

(b)  How many cwords contain both “drop” and “fails”? 

Solution.  Take  the words “drop” and “fails” and  the  remaining  letter “e”  in any order.  So  there 
are 3! such cwords. 

� 

(c)  Use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle to ﬁnd a simple formula for the number of passwords. 

Solution.  There  are  7!  cwords  that  contain  “drop”,  6!  that  contain  “fails”,  and  5!  that  contain 
“failed”.  There  are  3!  cwords  containing  both  “drop”  and  “fails”.  No  cword  can  contain  both 
“fails” and “failed”.  The cwords containing both “drop” and “failed” come from taking the sub-
word “failedrop” and the remaining letter “s” in any order, so there are 2! of them. So by Inclusion-
exclusion, we have the number of cwords containing at least one of the three forbidden subwords 
is 
(7! + 6! + 5!) − (3! + 0 + 2!) + 0 = 5!(49) − 8. 
Among the 10! cwords, the remaining ones are passwords, so the number of passwords is 
10! − 7! − 6! − 5! + 3! + 2! = 3, 622, 928.

Problem 2. 
Solve  the  following  counting  problems  by  deﬁning  an  appropriate mapping  (bijective  or  k-to-1) 
between a set whose size you know and the set in question. 

(a)  How many different ways are there to select a dozen donuts if four varieties are available? 

Solution.  There  is a bijection  from  selections of a dozen donuts  to 15-bit  sequences with exactly 
3  ones.  In particular,  suppose  that  the varieties  are  glazed,  chocolate,  lemon,  and Boston  creme. 
Then a selection of g glazed, c chocolate, l lemon, and b Boston creme maps to the sequence: 
(g 0�s) 1 (c 0�s) 1 (l 0�s) 1 (b 0�s) 
� �
Therefore, the number of selections is equal to the number of 15-bit sequences with exactly 3 ones, 
which is:

(b)  In  how many ways  can Mr.  and Mrs.  Grumperson  distribute  13  identical  pieces  of  coal  to 
their two —no, three! —children for Christmas? 
� � 
Solution.  There  is  a  bijection  from  15-bit  strings  with  two  ones.  In  particular,  the  bit  string 
0a10b10c  maps  to  the  assignment  of  a  coals  to  the  ﬁrst  child,  b  coals  to  the  second,  and  c  coals 
�
to the third. Therefore, there are  15  assignments.

(c)  How many solutions over the nonnegative integers are there to the inequality: 

x1  + x2  + . . . + x10 
�
� 
Solution.  There is a bijection from 110-bit sequences with 10 ones to solutions to this equation.  In 
particular, xi  is the number of zeros before the i-th one but after the (i − 1)-st one (or the beginning 
� 
110
of the sequence). Therefore, there are  10  solutions.

(d)  We want  to  count  step-by-step  paths  between  points  in  the  plane with  integer  coordinates. 
Ony  two  kinds  of  step  are  allowed:  a  right-step which  increments  the  x  coordinate,  and  an  up-
step which increments the y coordinate.

(i)  How many paths are there from (0, 0) to (20, 30)? 
Solution.  50  .

There is a bijection from 50-bit sequences with 20 zeros and 30 ones. The sequence (b1 , . . . , b30 ) 
maps to a path where the i-th step is right if bi  = 0 and up if bi  = 1. Therefore, the number of 
� 
50
paths is equal to  20  . 
(ii)  How many paths are there from (0, 0) to (20, 30) that go through the point (10, 10)?

There  is a bijection between  the paths  from  (20, 30)  that go  through  (10, 10) and set of pairs 
of paths  consisting of path  from  (0, 0)  to  (10, 10) and a path  from  (10, 10)  to  (20, 30).  So  the 
� 
number of paths through (10, 10) is the product of the sizes of these two sets of paths.

Solution. 

(iii)  How many paths are  there  from  (0, 0)  to  (20, 30)  that do not go  through either of  the points 
(10, 10) and (15, 20)?

Hint:  Let  P  be  the  set  of  paths  from  (0, 0)  to  (20, 30),  N1  be  the  paths  in  P  that  go  through

(10, 10) and N2  be the paths in P  that go through (15, 20).

N1  ∩ N2  is  the  set  of  paths  from  (0, 0)  to  (20, 30)  that  go  through  both  (10, 10)  and  (15, 20).  So 
P  − (N1  ∪ N2 ) is the set of paths to be counted. Now we have 
|P  − (N1  ∪ N2 )|
|P | − |N1  ∪ N2 | 
=
=  |P | − |N1 | − |N2 | + |N1  ∩ N2 | 
by Inclusion-Exclusion. 
Part (ii) shows how to calculate |Ni |. Also, there is a bijection between N1 ∩N2  and the set of triples 
consisting  of  a  path  (0, 0)  to  (10, 10),  a  path  from  (10, 10)  to  (15, 20),  and  a  path  from  (15, 20)  to 
(20, 30).  So the size of N1  ∩ N2  is the product of the sizes of these three sets of paths.

Solution. 

n! 
(n − m)! 
There are n choices for the ﬁrst letter, n − 1 choices for the second letter,  . . . n − m + 1 choices for 
the mth letter, so by the Generalized Product rule, the number of words is

The graph of a binary  relations  from A  to B  is a subset of A × B .  There are on 2mn  such subsets 
because |A × B | = mn.

Solution. 

m n 

There is a bijection between a placement of the balls and length m sequence whose ith element is 
the  urn where  the  ith  ball  is  placed.  So  the  number  of  placements  is  the  same  as  the  number  of

length m sequences of elements from a size-n set.

(h)	 How many ways are  there  to put a  total of m distinguishable balls 
into n distinguishable urns with at most one ball in each urn? 

Solution. 

n!

(n − m)!

There  is  a  bijection  between  a  placement  of  balls  and  a  length m  sequence whose  ith  element  is 
the urn containing the ith ball.  So the number of ball placements is the same as number of length
