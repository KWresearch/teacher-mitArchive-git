Problem 1. 
The table below lists some prerequisite information for some subjects in the MIT Computer Science 
program (in 2006).  This deﬁnes an indirect prerequisite relation, �, that is a strict partial order on 
these subjects.

(a)  Explain why exactly six terms are required to ﬁnish all these subjects, if you can take as many 
subjects as you want per term.  Using a greedy subject selection strategy, you should take as many 
subjects  as  possible  each  term.  Exhibit  your  complete  class  schedule  each  term  using  a  greedy 
strategy. 

Solution.  It helps to have a diagram of the direct prerequisite relation: 

There is a �-chain of length six: 
8.01 � 8.02 � 6.002 � 6.004 � 6.033 � 6.857

So six terms are necessary, because at most one of these subjects can be taken each term.

There is no longer chain, so with the greedy strategy you will take six terms. Here are the subjects

you take in successive terms.

(b)  In the second term of the greedy schedule, you took ﬁve subjects  including 18.03.  Identify a 
set of ﬁve subjects not including 18.03 such that it would be possible to take them in any one term 
(using some nongreedy schedule). Can you ﬁgure out how many such sets there are? 
Solution.  We’re looking for an antichain in the � relation that does not include 18.03. Every such 
antichain will have to include 18.02, 6.003, 6.034. Then a fourth subject could be any of 6.042, 6.046, 
and 6.840.  The ﬁfth subject could then be any of 6.004, 6.033, and 6.857.  This gives a total of nine 
� 
antichains of ﬁve subjects. 

(c)  Exhibit a schedule for taking all the courses —but only one per term. 
Solution.  We’re asking for a topological sort of �. There are many. One is 18.01, 8.01, 6.001, 18.02, 
� 
6.042, 18.03, 8.02, 6.034, 6.046, 6.002, 6.840, 6.004, 6.003, 6.033, 6.857. 

(d)  Suppose that you want to take all of the subjects, but can handle only two per term.  Exactly 
how many terms are required to graduate? Explain why. 
Solution.  There  are  �15/2�  = 8  terms  necessary.  The  schedule  below  shows  that  8  terms  are 
sufﬁcient as well: 

8.01 
1:  18.01 
2:  6.001  18.02 
3:  6.042  18.03 
4: 
8.02 
6.034 
5:  6.046  6.002 
6:  6.840  6.004 
7:  6.003  6.033 
8:  6.857 

(e)  What if you could take three subjects per term? 

Solution.  From part (a) we know six terms are required even if there is no limit on the number of 
subjects per term.  Six terms are also sufﬁcient, as the following schedule shows:

Problem 2. 
A  pair  of  6.042  TAs,  Liz  and  Oscar,  have  decided  to  devote  some  of  their  spare  time  this  term 
to  establishing  dominion  over  the  entire  galaxy.  Recognizing  this  as  an  ambitious  project,  they 
worked out the following table of tasks on the back of Oscar ’s copy of the lecture notes. 

1.	 Devise a logo and cool imperial theme music - 8 days. 

2.	 Build a ﬂeet of Hyperwarp Stardestroyers out of eating paraphernalia swiped from Lobdell 
- 18 days. 

3.	 Seize control of the United Nations - 9 days, after task #1. 

4.	 Get shots for Liz’s cat, Tailspin - 11 days, after task #1. 

5.	 Open a Starbucks chain for the army to get their caffeine - 10 days, after task #3. 

6.	 Train  an  army  of  elite  interstellar warriors  by  dragging  people  to  see  The  Phantom Menace 
dozens of times - 4 days, after tasks #3, #4, and #5. 

7.	 Launch  the ﬂeet  of  Stardestroyers,  crush  all  sentient  alien  species,  and  establish  a Galactic 
Empire - 6 days, after tasks #2 and #6. 

8.	 Defeat Microsoft - 8 days, after tasks #2 and #6. 

We  picture  this  information  in  Figure  1  below  by  drawing  a  point  for  each  task,  and  labelling  it 
with the name and weight of the task.  An edge between two points indicates that the task for the 
higher point must be completed before beginning the task for the lower one. 

(a)  Give some valid order in which the tasks might be completed. 

Solution.  We can easily ﬁnd several of them.  The most natural one is valid, too:  #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, 
#6, #7, #8. 

� 

Liz and Oscar want to complete all these tasks in the shortest possible time.  However, they have 
agreed on some constraining work rules. 

•	 Only one person can be assigned to a particular task; they can not work together on a single 
task.

•	 Once  a  person  is  assigned  to  a  task,  that  person must work  exclusively  on  the  assignment 
until it is completed. So, for example, Liz cannot work on building a ﬂeet for a few days, run 
to get shots for Tailspin, and then return to building the ﬂeet. 

(b)  Liz  and Oscar want  to  know  how  long  conquering  the  galaxy will  take.  Oscar  suggests  di­
viding  the  total  number  of  days  of work  by  the  number  of workers,  which  is  two.  What  lower 
bound on the time to conquer the galaxy does this give, and why might the actual time required 
be greater? 

Solution. 

8 + 18 + 9 + 11 + 10 + 4 + 6 + 8  =  37 days
2 

If  working  together  and  interrupting  work  on  a  task  were  permitted,  then  this  answer  would 
be  correct.  However,  the  rules may  prevent  Liz  and Oscar  from  both working  all  the  time.  For 
example,  suppose  the  only  task  was  building  the  ﬂeet.  It  will  take  18  days,  not  18/2  days,  to 
� 
complete, because only one person can work on it and the other must sit idle. 

(c)  Liz  proposes  a  different method  for  determining  the  duration  of  their  project.  He  suggests 
looking  at  the  duration  of  the  “critical  path”,  the  most  time-consuming  sequence  of  tasks  such 
that each depends on the one before.  What lower bound does this give, and why might it also be 
too low?

Solution.  The  longest  sequence  of  tasks  is  devising  a  logo  (8  days),  seizing  the  U.N.  (9  days), 
opening a Starbucks (10 days), training the army (4 days), and then defeating Microsoft (8 days). 
Since these tasks must be done sequentially, galactic conquest will require at least 39 days. 
If there were enough workers, this answer would be correct; however, with only two workers, Liz 
and Oscar may be unable to make progress on  the critical path every day.  For example, suppose 
there were only four tasks:  devise logo, build ﬂeet, seize control, get shots.  Now the critical path 
consists  of  two  critical  tasks:  devise  logo,  get  shots, which  take  19 days.  But  to  get  through  this 
path in 19 days, some worker must be working on a critical task at all times for the 19 days.  This 
leaves only one worker free to complete building the ﬂeet and seizing control, which will take at 
least  27  days.  So  in  fact,  27  days  is  the  minimum  time  for  two  workers  to  complete  these  four 
� 
tasks. 

(d)  What  is  the minimum  number  of  days  that  Liz  and Oscar  need  to  conquer  the  galaxy?  No 
proof is required. 

Solution.  40 days. Tasks could be divided as follows:

Oscar:  #1 (days 1-8), #3 (days 9-17), #4 (days 18-28), #8 (days 33-40).

Liz:  #2 (days 1-18), #5 (days 19-28), #6 (days 29-32), #7 (days 33-38).

It takes some care to verify that 40 days is the best you can do.  If someone comes up with a simple

proof of this, tell the course staff.

Problem 3.  (a)  What are the maximal and minimal elements, if any, of the power set P ({1, . . . , n}), 
where n is a positive integer, under the empty relation? 

Solution.  The  power  set  is  a  red  herring.  With  an  empty  relation  on  any  set,  every  element  is 
� 
maximal and minimal. 

(b)  What are the maximal and minimal elements, if any, of the set, N, of all nonnegative integers 
under divisibility?  Is there a minimum or maximum element? 

Solution.  The minimum  (and  therefore unique minimal)  element  is  1  since  1 divides  all natural 
numbers.  The maximum  (and  therefore  unique maximal)  element  is  0  since  all  numbers  divide 
� 
0. 

(c)  What are the minimal and maximal elements, if any, of the set of integers greater than 1 under 
divisibility? 

Solution.  All prime numbers are minimal elements, since no numbers divide them. 
There is no maximal element, because for any n >  1, there is a “larger ” number under the divisi­
� 
bility partial order, for example, 2n. 

(d)  Describe a partially ordered set that has no minimal or maximal elements. 

6 
Solution.  Z, R, etc.

(e)  Describe a partially ordered set that has a unique minimal element, but no minimum element. 
Hint:  It will have to be inﬁnite. 
Solution.  Z ∪ {i} where  i  is  a  root  of  −1,  under  the  usual  order  Z.  So  i  is  incomparable  to  ev­
erything but itself, and is therefore minimal —and maximal too.  The remaining elements are the 
integers, and none of them are minimal since n − 1 < n, which makes i unique.
