Problem 1. 
A license plate consists of either: 

•  3 letters followed by 3 digits (standard plate) 

•  5 letters (vanity plate) 

•  2 characters – letters or numbers (big shot plate) 

Let L be the set of all possible license plates. 

(a)  Express L in terms of 

A = {A, B , C, . . . , Z } 
D = {0, 1, 2, . . . , 9} 

using unions (∪) and set products (×). 
(b)  Compute |L|, the number of different license plates, using the sum and product rules. 

Problem 2. 
An n-vertex numbered tree is a tree whose vertex set is {1, 2, . . . , n} for some n >  2.  We deﬁne the 
code of the numbered tree to be a sequence of n − 2 integers from 1 to n obtained by the following 
recursive process: 

If  there  are more  than  two  vertices  left, write down  the  father  of  the  largest  leafa ,  delete  this  leaf, 
and continue this process on the resulting smaller tree. 
If there are only two vertices left, then stop —the code is complete. 

aThe necessarily unique node adjacent to a leaf is called its father. 

For example, the codes of a couple of numbered trees are shown in the Figure 1. 

(a)  Describe a procedure for reconstructing a numbered tree from its code.

Figure 1: 
(b)  Conclude  there  is  a  bijection  between  the  n-vertex  numbered  trees  and  {1, . . . , n} n−2 ,  and 
state how many n-vertex numbered trees there are. 

Problem 3.  (a)  How many of  the billion numbers  in  the  range  from  1  to  109  contain  the digit  1? 
(Hint: How many don’t?) 

(b)  There are 20 books arranged in a row on a shelf. Describe a bijection between ways of choos­
ing  6  of  these  books  so  that  no  two  adjacent  books  are  selected  and  15-bit  strings with  exactly  6 
ones. 

Problem 4. 

(a)  Let Sn,k  be the possible nonnegative integer solutions to the inequality 
· · · 
+ xk  ≤ n. 

x1  + x2  +

That is 

�
� 
Sn,k  ::=  (x1 , x2 , . . . , xk ) ∈ Nk  | (1) is true 
. 
Describe a bijection between Sn,k  and the set of binary strings with n zeroes and k ones.

(b)  Let Ln,k  be the length k weakly increasing sequences of nonnegative integers ≤ n. That is 
Ln,k  ::=  (y1 , y2 , . . . , yk ) ∈ Nk  | y1  ≤ y2  ≤  · · · ≤ yk  ≤ n . 
Describe a bijection between Ln,k  and Sn,k .
