Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 5, Mon. 

Problem 1. 
If a and b are distinct nodes of a digraph, then a is said to cover b if there is an edge from a to b and 
every path  from  a  to  b  traverses  this  edge.  If  a  covers  b,  the  edge  from  a  to  b  is  called  a  covering 
edge. 

(a)  What are the covering edges in the following DAG? 

Solution.  TBA

(b)  Let covering (D) be the subgraph of D consisting of only the covering edges.  Suppose D  is a 
ﬁnite DAG. Explain why covering (D) has the same positive path relation as D . 
Hint: Consider longest paths between a pair of vertices. 

Solution.  What we need to show is that if there is a path in D between vertices a =�
b, then there 
is a path consisting only of covering edges from a to b.  But since D  is a ﬁnite DAG, there must be 
a  longest  path  from  a  to  b.  Now  every  edge  on  this  path must  be  a  covering  edge  or  it  could  be 
� 
replaced by a path of length 2 or more, yielding a longer path from a to b. 

(c)  Show that if two DAG’s have the same positive path relation, then they have the same set of 
covering edges.

Solution.  Proof.  Suppose C  and D are DAG’s with the same positive path relation and that a
→ 
is a covering edge of C . We want to show that a
b must also be a covering edge of D .
→
Since a
b itself deﬁnes a (length one) positive length path in C , there must be a positive length 
path in D  from a to b.  If this positive length path in D  is of length greater than one, then the path 
must consist of a positive length path from a to c followed by a positive length path from c to b for 
some vertex, c. Also, since D is a DAG, c cannot be a or b. 
This means there must also be positive length paths in C  from a to c and from c to b, and neither 
→
b or  there would be a  cycle.  Hence  the path  from a  to  c  to  b  is a

to b in D , which proves that a

(d)  Conclude that covering (D) is the unique DAG with the smallest number of edges among all 
digraphs with the same positive path relation as D . 

Solution.  By  part  (c),  any  DAG  with  the  same  positive  path  relation  as  D  must  contain  all  the 
edges  of  covering (D).  By  part  (b),  covering (D)  has  this  same  positive  path  relation.  It  follows 
immediately  that  covering (D)  is  the  unique  minimum-size  DAG  with  the  same  positive  path 
� 
relation as D . 

The  following examples show  that  the above results don’t work  in general  for digraphs with cy­
cles. 
(e)  Describe two graphs with vertices {1, 2} which have the same set of covering edges, but not 
the same positive path relation (Hint:  Self-loops.) 

Solution.  Let  one  graph  have  edges  {(1, 2), (1, 1)}  and  the  other  {(1, 2), (2, 2)}.  They  have  the 
same set of covering edges, namely,  (1, 2).  But  in  the second  there  is a positive  length path  from 
2  to  2,  namely  a  path  of  length  one  but  there  is  no  positive  length  path  from  2  to  2  in  the  ﬁrst 
� 
graph. 

(f)	

(i)  The  complete  digraph without  self-loops  on  vertices  1, 2, 3  has  edges  between  every  two 
distinct vertices. What are its covering edges? 
(ii)  What are the covering edges of the graph with vertices 1, 2, 3 and edges 1
(iii)  What about their positive path relations?

Solution. 
(i)  There  are  no  covering  edges,  since  there  is  always  a  length  two  path  from  a  to  b 
b.→ 
that does not use the edge a
(ii)  All three edges are the covering edges. 
(iii)  They have the same positive path relation, namely, each vertex is connected to all the vertices, 
including itself, by positive length paths.

Problem 2.  (a)  Give an example showing that two vertices in a digraph may be on the same cycle, 
but not necessarily on the same simple cycle. 

Solution.  Let  the vertices be a, b, c and edges be  (a, b), (b, a), (b, c), (c, b).  Now a and  c are on  the 
cyle  a, b, c, b, a,  but  every  cycle  from  a  to  c  must  go  through  b  at  least  twice,  and  so  will  not  be 
� 
simple. 

(b)  Prove  that  if  two  vertices  in  a  digraph  are  connected,  then  they  are  connected  by  a  simple 
path. Hint:  the shortest path. 
Solution.  Consider a shortest path from a to b =� a: 

and suppose this path is not simple. That is, suppose ai  = aj  for some i, j . Then 

a = a0 , a1 , . . . , ai , . . . , aj , . . . , ak  = b, 

is a shorter path from a to b, a contradiction. 

a = a0 , a1 , . . . , ai , aj+1 , . . . , ak  = b.

Problem 3. 
In  an  n-player  round-robin  tournament,  every  pair  of  distinct  players  compete  in  a  single  game. 
Assume  that  every game has a winner —there are no  ties.  The  results of  such a  tournament  can 
then be represented with a tournament digraph where the vertices correspond to players and there

y  iff x beat y  in their game. 
is an edge x

(a)  Explain why a tournament digraph cannot have cycles of length 1 or 2. 

Solution.  There  are  no  self-loops  in  a  tournament  graph  since  no  player  plays  himself,  so  no 
length 1 cycles. Also, it cannot be that x beats y and y beats x for x =�
y , since every pair competes 
exactly once and there are no ties. This means there are no length 2 cycles. 

� 

(b)  Is the “beats” relation for a tournament graph always/sometimes/never: 

•  asymmetric? 
•  reﬂexive? 
•  irreﬂexive? 
•  transitive? 

Explain. 

Solution.  No self-loops implies the relation is irreﬂexive.  It is also asymmetric since it is irreﬂex­
ive and for every pair of distinct players, exactly one game is played and results in a win for one 
� 
of the players.  Some tournament graphs represent transitive relations and others don’t.

(c)  Show that a tournament graph represents a total order iff there are no cycles of length 3. 

Solution.  As observed  in  the previous part,  the “beats” relation whose graph  is a  tournament  is 
asymmetric and irreﬂexive.  Since every pair of players is comparable, the relation is a total order 
iff it is transitive. 
→

→
“Beats”  is  transitive  iff  for  any  players  x,  y  and  z ,  x
z  (and
z  implies  that  x
y  and  y

x).  Therefore, “beats” is transitive iff there are no cycles of 
consequently that there is no edge z
