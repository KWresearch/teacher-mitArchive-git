Sampling & 
Confidence

Sampling
Estimate % contaminated ﬁsh in 
Charles River?

Procedure: catch n fish, test each,
  use %contaminated in catch as 
estimate of %contaminated in 
whole river

Sampling Questions 

Model as Coin Tosses 

Catch 500 ﬁsh; what is
probability that estimate
is within 0.1 of the actual
fraction?

p ::= fraction contaminated in river 
 test a fish  toss bias p coin
 catch n fish  toss n coins 
 An ::= fraction contaminated
            in the sample of n

Confidence in our estimate

With probability 0.95 our
estimated fraction will be 
within 0.1 of the actual
fraction of contaminated 
fish in the whole river.

Confidence in our estimate
We can actually be 99%
confident that our 
estimated fraction is with 
0.06 of the true fraction 
of contaminated fish in the 
whole river. 

not Probable Reality 
Confidence
Now suppose we sample 500 fish and 
discover 230 are contaminated. 
So we estimate p is 230/500 = 0.46
It’s tempting to say 
“the probability that
p = 0.46± 0.06
is at least 0.99”
--technically wrong!

Confidence
p is the actual fraction of 
bad fish in the river. 
p is unknown,
but not a random variable! 

Confidence
The possible outcomes of our
sampling procedure is a random 
variable.  We can say that the
 “probability that our sampling
 process will yield a fraction
 that is ± 0.06 of the
 true fraction at least 0.99”

Albert R Meyer,            May 10, 2010 

lec 14M.17 

Confidence
for simplicity we say that 

p = 0.46 ± 0.06
  at the 
  99% confidence level 

Confidence
Moral: when you are told that  
some fact holds at a high
confidence level, remember
that a random experiment 
lies behind this claim. 
Ask
yourself “what experiment?”
