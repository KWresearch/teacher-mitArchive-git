Graph Connectivity 
Trees

Connected Components 

Every graph consists of 
 separate connected 
pieces (subgraphs) called 
connected components

Connected Components 

The connected component
of vertex v ::=

the more connected components,
the more “broken up" the graph is.

Connected Components 

So a graph is connected
iff  it has only 
1 connected component 

  Edge Connectedness 
Def: vertices v, w are 
k-edge connected 
if they remain connected 
whenever fewer than k
edges are deleted.

k-edge Connectedness

Def: A whole graph is k-
edge connected iff every 
two vertices are k-edge
connected.

  Edge Connectedness 

Connectivity measures fault  
tolerance of a network: 
how many connections can
fail without cutting off
communication?

Cut Edges 

Cut Edges 

An edge is a cut edge if
removing it from the graph
disconnects two vertices.

B

B is a cut edge

So a connected graph is

it has no cut edge.

A simple cycle is a cycle 
of length > 2 that doesn’t 
cross itself:

it is on a simple cycle.
