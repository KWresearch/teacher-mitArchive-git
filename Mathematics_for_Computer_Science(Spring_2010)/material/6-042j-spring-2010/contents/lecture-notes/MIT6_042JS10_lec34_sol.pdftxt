Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 12, Fri. 

Problem 1. 
There  are  two  decks  of  cards.  One  is  complete,  but  the  other  is missing  the  ace  of  spades.  Sup­
pose you pick one of  the  two decks with equal probability and  then  select a  card  from  that deck 
uniformly at random.  What  is the probability that you picked the complete deck, given that you 
selected the eight of hearts? Use the four-step method and a tree diagram. 

Solution.  Let  C  be  the  event  that  you  pick  the  complete  deck,  and  let  H  be  the  event  that  you 
select the eight of hearts.  In these terms, our aim is to compute: 

Pr {C  |  H } = 

Pr {C ∩ H }
Pr {H } 

A tree diagram is worked out below: 

Now we can compute the desired conditional probability as follows:

Thus, if you selected the eight of hearts, then the deck you picked is less likely to be the complete 
one.  It’s worth thinking about how you might have arrived at this ﬁnal conclusion without going 
through the detailed calculation.

Problem 2. 
There  are  three  prisoners  in  a  maximum-security  prison  for  ﬁctional  villains:  the  Evil  Wizard 
Voldemort, the Dark Lord Sauron, and Little Bunny Foo-Foo.  The parole board has declared that 
it will release two of the three, chosen uniformly at random, but has not yet released their names. 
Naturally, Sauron ﬁgures  that he will be released  to his home  in Mordor, where  the shadows  lie, 
with probability 2/3. 

A guard offers  to  tell Sauron  the name of one of  the other prisoners who will be  released  (either 
Voldemort or Foo-Foo). Sauron knows the guard to be a truthful fellow. However, Sauron declines 
this offer. He reasons that if the guard says, for example, “Little Bunny Foo-Foo will be released”, 
then his own probability of release will drop to 1/2.  This is because he will then know that either 
he or Voldemort will also be released, and these two events are equally likely. 

Using a  tree diagram and  the  four-step method,  either prove  that  the Dark Lord Sauron has  rea­
soned correctly or prove that he is wrong. Assume that if the guard has a choice of naming either 
Voldemort or Foo-Foo (because both are to be released), then he names one of the two uniformly 
at random. 

Solution.  Sauron has reasoned incorrectly.  In order to understand his error, let’s begin by working 
out the sample space, noting events of interest, and computing outcome probabilities:

Deﬁne the events S , F , and “F ” as follows: 

“F ” = Guard says Foo-Foo is released 
F  = Foo-Foo is released 
S  = Sauron is released 

The outcomes in each of these events are noted in the tree diagram. 
Sauron’s  error  is  in  failing  to  realize  that  the  event F  (Foo-foo will  be  released)  is different  from 
the event “F ” (the guard says Foo-foo will be released).  In particular,  the probability that Sauron 
is released, given that Foo-foo is released, is indeed 1/2: 
Pr {S ∩ F }
Pr {S F } =

Pr {F }

But the probability that Sauron is released given that the guard merely says so is still 2/3: 
Pr {S ∩ “F ” }

Pr {S

So Sauron’s probability of release is actually unchanged by the guard’s statement.

Problem 3. 
Suppose that you ﬂip three fair, mutually independent coins. Deﬁne the following events: 

•  Let A be the event that the ﬁrst coin is heads.

Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 12, Fri. 

•  Let B be the event that the second coin is heads. 

•  Let C  be the event that the third coin is heads. 

•  Let D be the event that an even number of  coins are heads. 

(a)  Use  the  four  step  method  to  determine  the  probability  space  for  this  experiment  and  the 
probability of each of A, B , C, D . 

Solution.  The  tree  is a binary  tree with depth 3 and 8  leaves.  The successive  levels branching  to 
show whether or not the successive events A, B , C occur. By deﬁnition of fair and independent, each 
branch out of a vertex  is  equally  likely  to be  followed.  So  the probability  space has as outcomes 
the eight length-3 strings of H’s and T’s, each of which has probability (1/2)3  = 1/8. 
Each  of  the  events  events  A, B , C, D  are  true  in  four  of  the  outcomes  and  hence  has  probability 
� 
1/2. 

(b)  Show that these events are not mutually independent. 

Solution. 

Pr {A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D} = 0 = (1
/2)4  = Pr {A} · Pr {B } · Pr {C } · Pr {D} . 

� 

(c)  Show that they are 3-way independent. 

Solution.  Because the coin tosses are mutually independent, we know: 
Pr {A ∩ B ∩ C } = Pr {A} · Pr {B } · Pr {C } . 
What  remains  is  to  check  that  equality  holds  for  the  other  subsets  of  three  events:  {A, B , D}, 
{A, C, D}, and {B , C, D}. By symmetry, again, we need only check one, say the ﬁrst one. 
1
Pr {A ∩ B ∩ D} = Pr {{HH T }} = 
.8
Since this is equal to Pr {A} · Pr {B } · Pr {D}, these three events are independent.

We conclude that all four events are three-way independent.
