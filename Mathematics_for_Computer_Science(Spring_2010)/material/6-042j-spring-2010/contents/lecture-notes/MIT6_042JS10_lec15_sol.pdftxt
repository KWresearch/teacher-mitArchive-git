Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 6, Mon. 

Solution.  See if the Mating Ritual with Boys as suitors yields the same solution as the algorithm 
with Girls as suitors. These two marriage assignments are boy-optimal and boy-pessimal, respec­
tive.  Obviously,  if every boy’s optimal and pessimal choices are the same,  then every boy has an 
unique choice. The solution is unique. 

� 

Problem 2. 
A preserved invariant of the Mating ritual is: 

For  every  girl,  G,  and  every  boy,  B ,  if G  is  crossed  off B ’s  list,  then G  has  a  favorite 
suitor and she prefers him over B . 

Use the  invariant to prove  that the Mating Algorithm produces stable marriages.  (Don’t  look up 
the proof in the Notes or slides.) 

Solution.  Proof.  Let Brad be some boy and Jen be any girl that he is not married to on the last day 
of the Mating Ritual. We claim that Brad and Jen are not a rogue couple.  Since Brad is an arbitrary 
boy, it follows that no boy is part of a rogue couple. Hence the marriages on the last day are stable. 
To prove the claim, we consider two cases: 
Case  1.  Jen  is  not  on  Brad’s  list.  Then  by  invariant  P ,  we  know  that  Jen  prefers  her  husband  to 
Brad.  So she’s not going to run off with Brad:  the claim holds in this case. 
Case 2.  Otherwise, Jen is on Brad’s list.  But since Brad is not married to Jen, he must be choosing 
to  serenade his wife  instead of  Jen,  so he must prefer his wife.  So he’s not going  to  run off with 
� 
Jen:  the claim also holds in this case. 

Problem 3. 
Suppose that Harry is one of the boys and Alice is one of the girls in the Mating Ritual.  Which of 
the properties below are preserved invariants? Why? 

a.  Alice is the only girl on Harry’s list. 

b.  There is a girl who does not have any boys serenading her. 

c.  If Alice is not on Harry’s list, then Alice has a suitor that she prefers to Harry. 

d.  Alice is crossed off Harry’s list and Harry prefers Alice to anyone he is serenading. 

e.  If Alice is on Harry’s list, then she prefers to Harry to any suitor she has. 

Solution.  The 1st, 3rd, and 4th are preserved invariants. 

a.  A  preserved  invariant;  no  girl will  be  added  to Harry’s  list.  If Alice  got  crossed  off,  there 
would  be  no  one  for  Harry  to  marry.  So  she  must  remain  as  the  sole  girl  on  his  list.  Re­
minder: A preserved invariant need not be true all the time, as in this example.  It only needs 
to stay true once it ﬁrst becomes true.

b.  Not  preserved;  a  girl may  not  have  a  suitor  on  the  ﬁrst  day, —if,  for  example,  she’s  not  at 
the  top of  any boy’s  list —but  every girl  is guaranteed  to have one  at  the  end,  namely,  her 
husband. 

c.  A preserved invariant; this is the basic invariant used to verify the Ritual. 

d.  A  preserved  invariant;  Harry  crosses  off  the  girls  in  his  order  of  preference,  so  if  Alice  is 
crossed off, Harry likes her better than anybody that’s left. 

e.  Not preserved.  Suppose the preferences among two couples and a third boy are: 
Harry:  Alice, 
Elvira, 
. . .

Elvira,  Alice, 
Billy: 
. . .

. . .

Wilfred:  Elvira, 
. . .

Alice: 
Billy, 
Harry, 
. . .

Elvira:  Wilfred,  Billy, 
The  alleged  invariant  is  true  on  the  ﬁrst  day  since Harry  is  Alice’s  only  suitor.  But  Elvira 
rejects Billy in favor of Wilfred on the ﬁrst afternoon, so on the second day, Billy and Harry 
are  serenading  Alice.  Since  Alice  prefers  Billy  to Harry,  the  alleged  invariant  is  no  longer 
true, so it was not preserved.

Problem 4. 
Consider a stable marriage problem with 4 boys and 4 girls and the following partial information 
about their preferences: 

– 
– 
B1:  G1  G2 
B2:  G2  G1 
– 
– 
–  G4  G3 
– 
B3: 
–  G3  G4 
B4: 
– 
G1:  B2  B1 
– 
– 
– 
G2:  B1  B2 
– 
B3  B4 
– 
– 
G3: 
G4: 
– 
– 
B4  B3 

(a)  Verify that 

will be a stable matching whatever the unspeciﬁed preferences may be. 

(B 1, G1), (B 2, G2), (B 3, G3), (B 4, G4) 

•  B 1 and B 2 get their 1st choice, so won’t be in a rogue couple. 
Solution. 
•	 G1 and G2 get their 2nd choices, so won’t be in a rogue couple with the other two boys, B 3 
or B 4.  So G1 and G2 won’t be in any rogue couple, either. 
•	 G3 and G4 get their best remaining choices, so will never be in a rogue couple.

•  This leaves no possible rogue partners for B3 and B 4. 
So the marriages are sure to be stable. 

� 

(b)  Explain why  the stable matching above  is neither boy-optimal nor boy-pessimal and so will 
not be an outcome of the Mating Ritual. 

Solution.  Notice that giving G1 and G2 their ﬁrst choices, that is, marrying (B 1, G2) and (B 2, G1) 
would  also  be  stable  for  the  same  reason.  But  with  this  switch,  B 1  does  worse.  So  the  stable 
matching above is not boy-pessimal. 
Likewise,  after marrying  off  the ﬁrst  two  boys  and  girls,  giving B 3  and B 4  their  best  remaining 
choices,  that  is,  marrying  (B 3, G4), (B 4, G3),  will  also  be  stable.  But  with  this  switch,  B 3  does 
better.  So the stable matching above is not boy-optimal. 
This implies that the stable matching above would not be produced by the Mating Ritual.

(c)  Describe how to deﬁne a set of marriage preferences among n boys and n girls which have at 
least 2n/2  stable assignments. 
Hint: Arrange the boys into a list of n/2 pairs, and likewise arrange the girls into a list of n/2 pairs 
of girls.  Choose preferences so  that  the kth pair of boys ranks  the kth pair of girls  just below  the 
previous pairs of girls, and likewise for the kth pair of girls. Within the kth pairs, make sure each 
boy’s ﬁrst choice girl in the pair prefers the other boy in the pair. 

Solution.  Suppose  a match  has  the  two  boys  in  the  kth  pair married  to  the  two  girls  in  the  kth 
pair,  for 1  ≤  k  ≤  n/2.  A boy  John,  in  the kth pair of boys will never be  in a rogue couple with a 
girl, Jill, who is in the j th pair of girls for j  =�
k , because if j > k , then Jill prefers her partner in the 
j th pair to John, and if j < k then John prefers his partner in the kth pair to Jill. 
A  rogue  couple  can  only  involve  a  boy,  John,  and  a  girl,  Mary,  in  the  same  pair,  but  this  is  im­
possible  since  (exactly)  one  of  John  and Mary must  be married  to  their  preferred  choice  in  their 
pair. 
Since each boy can be stably married to either of the girls in the kth pair, and there are n/2 pairs, 
� 
the total number of such stable matchings is 2n/2 .
