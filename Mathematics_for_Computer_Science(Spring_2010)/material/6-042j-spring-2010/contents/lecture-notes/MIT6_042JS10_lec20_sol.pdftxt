(a)  For each picture, describe its discrete faces (simple cycles that deﬁne the region borders). 

Solution.  Figs 1 & 2: abda, bcdb, abcda. Fig 3: abcdea, adea,abda,bcdb. Fig 4: abcda, abdea, bdcb,

(b)  Which of the pictured graphs are  isomorphic?  Which pictures represent the same planar em­
bedding?  – that is, they have the same discrete faces. 

Solution.  Figs 1 & 2 have the same faces, so are different pictures of the same planar drawing. Figs 
3 & 4 both have  four  faces, but  they are different,  for example, Fig 3 has a  face with 5 edges, but 
� 
the longest face in Fig 4 has 4 edges. 

(c)  Describe  a  way  to  construct  the  embedding  in  Figure  4  according  to  the  recursive  Deﬁni­
tion 12.3.1 of planar embedding.  For each application of a constructor rule, be sure to indicate the 
faces (cycles) to which the rule was applied and the cycles which result from the application. 

Solution.  Here’s one way.  (By Lemma 12.7.1, the constructor steps could be done in any order.)

Problem 2. 
Prove the following assertions by structural induction on the deﬁnition of planar embedding. 

(a)  In a planar embedding of a graph, each edge is traversed a total of two times by the faces of 
the embedding. 
Solution.  Proof.  The induction hypothesis is that if E  is a planar embedding of a graph, then each 
edge is traversed exactly twice by the faces of E . 
Base case: There is one vertex and no edges, so this case holds vacuously. 
Constructor case:  (face-splitting) The only change  is  that one  face of E  splits  into  two new  faces, 
each traversing the new edge once.

Constructor case:  (bridge between two connected graphs) The only change is that two faces merge 
into one face that makes two traversals of the new bridging edge.  So the traversals of other edges 
are unchanged, and the new edge is traversed twice by the new face. 
So in any case, all edges of E  are traversed exactly twice. This completes the proof of the Construc­
tor case. We conclude by structural induction that for all planar embeddings, E , then each edge is 
traversed exactly twice by the faces of E .

(b)  In a planar embedding of a connected graph with at least three vertices, each face is of length 
at least three. 

Solution.  Proof.  The  induction  hypothesis  is  that  if  E  is  a  planar  embedding  of  a  graph with  at 
least three vertices, then all faces in E  are of length at least three. 
Base case: There is one vertex, so this case holds vacuously. 
Constructor case:  (face-splitting) An edge a—b is added between nonadjacent vertices a, b on the 
same face. This face is replaced by two new faces of the form abc . . . a and abd . . . a where c =�
d are 
vertices different from a and b.  So both new faces are of length at least 3; no other faces change. 
Constructor case:  (bridge between two connected graphs) 
case 1:  (both graphs have one vertex).  Connecting these graphs with a bridge gives a graph with 
fewer than three vertices, so this case holds vacuously. 
case  2:  (one  graph  has  exactly  two  vertices  and  the  other  has  at most  two  vertices).  Connecting 
these graphs with a bridge yields a line graph of length two or three whose unique embedding is 
a  cycle of  length  four or  six going  from one end of  the graph  to  the other and back.  In any  case, 
the one face has length more than three. 
case 3:  (one graph has at most two vertices and the other has at  least three vertices).  Connecting 
replaces the face of the vertex graph with at most two vertices and a face of the other graph with 
a face of length at least 2 + 3 = 5, and leaves all other faces unchanged.  So all faces are indeed of 
length at least three. 
case 4:  (both graphs have at least three vertices).  Connecting replaces two faces of length at least 
three by a single face of length at least 2 + 3 + 3 = 7, and leaves all other faces unchanged.  So all 
faces are indeed of length at least three. 
So  in any case, all  faces of connected planar embedding of graphs with at  least  three vertices are 
indeed of length at least three. This completes the proof of the Constructor case and the structural 
induction.

Problem 3.  (a)  Show  that  if  a  connected  planar  graph  with  more  than  two  vertices  is  bipartite, 
then 
e ≤ 2v − 4. 
Hint:  Similar to the proof of Corollary 12.6.3 that for planar graphs e ≤ 3v − 6.

Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 7, Fri. 

Solution.  By Problem 2.b,  every  face  is of  length at  least 3.  But  in a bipartite graph  there are no 
cycles of odd length, so all must be of length at least 4.

Each edge is traversed by exactly two faces, so 
length(f ) ≥ 
4 = 4f .	
f ∈ faces 
f ∈ faces 
By Euler ’s formula, f  = e − v + 2, so substituting for f  in (2), yields 
2e ≥ 4(e − v + 2), 

2e =

(b)  Conclude  that  that K3,3  is not planar.  (K3,3  is  the  graph with  six  vertices  and  an  edge  from 
each of the ﬁrst three vertices to each of the last three.) 

Solution.  K3,3  is bipartite and connected.  Also,  it has 9 edges and 6 vertices,  and  since 9  >  8 = 
2 6 − 4, it does not satisfy (1), and so cannot be planar.

Appendix 

Deﬁnition 3.1.  A planar embedding of a connected graph consists of a nonempty set of cycles of the 
graph  called  the  discrete  faces  of  the  embedding.  Planar  embeddings  are  deﬁned  recursively  as 
follows: 

•	 Base case:  If G is a graph consisting of a single vertex, v , then a planar embedding of G has 
one discrete face, namely the length zero cycle, v . 

•	 Constructor Case:  (split a  face) Suppose G  is a connected graph with a planar embedding, 
and  suppose  a  and  b  are  distinct,  nonadjacent  vertices  of  G  that  appear  on  some  discrete 
face, γ , of the planar embedding. That is, γ  is a cycle of the form 
· · · 
a . . . b 
a.

Then the graph obtained by adding the edge a—b to the edges of G has a planar embedding 
with the same discrete faces as G, except that face γ  is replaced by the two discrete faces1 
· · · 
a . . . ba  and ab 
a,

as illustrated in Figure 1. 

1  There  is  one  exception  to  this  rule.  If G  is  a  line graph beginning with  a  and  ending with  b,  then  the  cycles  into 
which γ splits are actually the same. That’s because adding edge a—b creates a simple cycle graph, Cn , that divides the 
plane  into an “inner ” and an “outer ”  region with  the same border.  In order  to maintain  the correspondence between 
continuous  faces  and  discrete  faces,  we  have  to  allow  two  “copies”  of  this  same  cycle  to  count  as  discrete  faces.  But 
since  this  is  the  only  situation  in which  two  faces  are  actually  the  same  cycle,  this  exception  is  better  explained  in  a 
footnote than mentioned explicitly in the deﬁnition.

Figure 1: The Split a Face Case. 

•	 Constructor Case:  (add a bridge) Suppose G and H  are connected graphs with planar em-
beddings and disjoint sets of vertices. Let a be a vertex on a discrete face, γ , in the embedding 
of G. That is, γ  is of the form 

a . . . a. 

Similarly, let b be a vertex on a discrete face, δ , in the embedding of H , so δ  is of the form 
· · · 
b 
b.

Then  the  graph  obtained  by  connecting G  and H  with  a  new  edge,  a—b,  has  a  planar  em­
bedding whose discrete faces are the union of the discrete faces of G and H , except that faces 
γ  and δ are replaced by one new face 

as illustrated in Figure 2.

An arbitrary graph is planar iff each of its connected components has a planar embedding. 

Theorem 3.2 (Euler ’s Formula).  If a connected graph has a planar embedding, then 
v − e + f  = 2 

where v  is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f  is the number of faces. 
Corollary 3.3.  Suppose a connected planar graph has v ≥ 3 vertices and e edges. Then 
e ≤ 3v − 6. 

Proof.  By  deﬁnition,  a  connected  graph  is  planar  iff  it  has  a  planar  embedding.  So  suppose  a

connected graph with v vertices and e edges has a planar embedding with f  faces. By Problem 2.a,

every edge is traversed exactly twice by the face boundaries.  So the sum of the lengths of the face

boundaries is exactly 2e. Also by Problem 2.b, when v ≥ 3, each face boundary is of length at least

three, so this sum is at least 3f . This implies that 
3f  ≤ 2e. 
But f  = e − v + 2 by Euler ’s formula, and substituting into (3) gives 
3(e − v + 2) ≤ 2e 
e − 3v + 6 ≤ 0 
e ≤ 3v − 6 

(3) 

Corollary 3.4.  K5  is not planar. 

Proof. 

e = 10 > 9 = 3v − 6.
