Problem 1. 
The Massachusetts Turnpike Authority is concerned about the integrity of the new Zakim bridge. 
Their consulting architect has warned  that  the bridge may collapse  if more  than 1000 cars are on 
it at  the same  time.  The Authority has also been warned by  their  trafﬁc consultants  that  the  rate 
of accidents from cars speeding across bridges has been increasing. 
Both to lighten trafﬁc and to discourage speeding,  the Authority has decided to make the bridge 
one-way and to put tolls at both ends of the bridge (don’t laugh, this is Massachusetts).  So cars will 
pay  tolls  both  on  entering  and  exiting  the  bridge,  but  the  tolls will  be  different.  In  particular,  a 
car will pay $3 to enter onto the bridge and will pay $2 to exit.  To be sure that there are never too 
many cars on the bridge, the Authority will let a car onto the bridge only if the difference between 
the amount of money  currently at  the  entry  toll booth minus  the amount at  the  exit  toll booth  is 
strictly less than a certain threshold amount of $T0 . 
The consultants have decided to model this scenario with a state machine whose states are triples 
of natural numbers, (A, B , C ), where 

•  A is an amount of money at the entry booth, 

•  B  is an amount of money at the exit booth, and 

•  C  is a number of cars on the bridge. 

Any  state  with  C >  1000  is  called  a  collapsed  state,  which  the  Authority  dearly  hopes  to  avoid. 
There will be no transition out of a collapsed state. 
Since the toll booth collectors may need to start off with some amount of money in order to make 
change,  and  there  may  also  be  some  number  of  “ofﬁcial”  cars  already  on  the  bridge  when  it  is 
opened  to  the  public,  the  consultants must  be  ready  to  analyze  the  system  started  at  any  uncol­
lapsed  state.  So  let  A0  be  the  initial  number  of  dollars  at  the  entrance  toll  booth,  B0  the  initial 
number of dollars  at  the  exit  toll booth,  and C0  ≤  1000  the number of ofﬁcial  cars on  the bridge 
when  it  is opened.  You  should assume  that even ofﬁcial cars pay  tolls on exiting or entering  the 
bridge after the bridge is opened. 

(a)  Give a mathematical model of the Authority’s system for letting cars on and off the bridge by 
specifying a transition relation between states of the form (A, B , C ) above. 

Solution.  State (A, B , C ) goes to state 
(i)	 (A + 3, B , C + 1), provided that A − B < T0  and C  ≤  1000.  This  transition models  the case 
where a car enters the bridge.

(ii)	 (A, B + 2, C − 1), provided  that 0  < C  ≤  1000.  This  transition models  the case where a car 
leaves the bridge. 

Note that the condition for the ﬁrst transition has C  ≤  1000 instead of C <  1000.  A car can enter 
so  long  as  it  is not  in  the  collapsed  state  (C >  1000).  In  other words,  a  car may  still  enter when 
C  = 1000; and the next state will be a collapsed state with C  = 1001 > 1000.

(b)	 Characterize each of the following derived variables

constant 
SI 
strictly increasing 
strictly decreasing 
SD 
weakly increasing but not constant  WI 
weakly decreasing but not constant  WD 
N 
none of the above 

and brieﬂy explain your reasoning. 

Solution.  In every transition, at least one of A and B  increases.  So their sum is strictly increasing. 
2A − 3B  can ﬂuctuate, going up on (i) and down on (ii). 
The difference 3C − A doesn’t change under transitions of type (i), but decreases under transitions 
of type (ii); so is weakly decreasing. 

However, B +3C increases under transitions of type (i), but decreases under transitions of type (ii). 
On the other hand, 6C  and 2A − 3B  simultaneously increase by 6 under transition (i) or simulta­
neously decrease by 6 under transition (ii), which makes their difference constant. 
Finally,  under  (i),  2A  increases  by  6,  B  is  unchanged,  and  3C  increases  by  3,  so  2A − 2B  − 3C 
increases by 6 − 3 = 3.  However, under (ii), A is unchanged, 3C  decreases by 3 and 2B  increases 
by 4, so 2A − 2B − 3C  decreases by −(−4) − 3 = 1.

The Authority has asked their engineering consultants to determine T  and to verify that this policy 
will keep the number of cars from exceeding 1000. 
The  consultants  reason  that  if C0  is  the  number  of  ofﬁcial  cars  on  the  bridge when  it  is  opened, 
then  an  additional  1000 − C0  cars  can  be  allowed  on  the  bridge.  So  as  long  as  A − B  has  not 
increased by 3(1000 − C0 ), there shouldn’t more than 1000 cars on the bridge.  So they recommend 
deﬁning 
T0  ::= 3(1000 − C0 ) + (A0  − B0 ), 
(1) 
where  A0  is  the  initial  number  of  dollars  at  the  entrance  toll  booth,  B0  is  the  initial  number  of 
dollars at the exit toll booth. 

(c)  Use  the  results  of part  (b)  to deﬁne  a  simple predicate,  P ,  on  states  of  the  transition  system 
which  is  satisﬁed  by  the  start  state,  that  is  P (A0 , B0 , C0 )  holds,  is  not  satisﬁed  by  any  collapsed 
state, and is a preserved invariant of the system. Explain why your P  has these properties. 
Solution.  Let D0  ::= 2A0  − 3B0  − 6C0 . 
Preserved Invariant: 
P (A, B , C ) ::= [2A − 3B − 6C  = D0 ]  AND  [C  ≤ 1000]. 
Note that P (A0 , B0 , C0 ) is true because we know that C0  ≤ 1000, and it is not true in any collapsed 
state.  To  verify  that  P  is  preserved,  suppose  state  (A, B , C )  has  a  transition  to  (A� , B � , C � ),  and 
P (A, B , C ) is true. We verify that P (A� , B � , C � ) is true by considering the two kinds of transitions. 
Transition (i) (a car enters the bridge):  so 
6C �  = 6(C + 1) = 6C + 6 = (2A − 3B − D0 ) + 6 = 2(A + 3) − 3B − D0  = 2A�  − 3B �  − D0 ,

as required. 
Also, the transition is possible only if A − B < T0 . But this implies 
6C �  = 2A�  − 3B �  − D0 
= 2(A�  − B � ) − B �  − D0 
= 2((A + 3) − B ) − B − D0 
= 2(A − B ) − B − D0  + 6 
≤ 2(A − B ) − B0  − D0  + 6 
≤ 2(T0  − 1) − B0  − D0  + 6 
= 2[3(1000 − C0 ) + (A0  − B0 )] − B0  − D0  + 4(by (1)) 
= 6000 − 6C0  + 2A0  − 3B0  − D0  + 4 
= 6004, 
and so C �  ≤ �6004/6� = 1000, as required. 
Transition (ii) (a car leaves the bridge):  so 
6C �  = 6(C − 1) = 6C − 6 = 2A − 3B − 6 = 2A − 3(B + 2) = 2A�  − 3B � . 
In addition, C �  < C  ≤ 1000 so C �  ≤ 1000.

(d)  A  clever  MIT  intern  working  for  the  Turnpike  Authority  agrees  that  the  Turnpike’s  bridge 
management  policy  will  be  safe:  the  bridge  will  not  collapse.  But  she  warns  her  boss  that  the 
policy will  lead  to  deadlock—  a  situation where  trafﬁc  can’t move  on  the bridge  even  though  the 
bridge has not collapsed. 
Explain  more  precisely  in  terms  of  system  transitions  what  the  intern  means,  and  brieﬂy,  but 
clearly, justify her claim. 

Solution.  The intern means that any long enough sequence of transitions will arrive at a state in 
which no transition is possible, even though there are no cars on the bridge. This happens because 
every time a car enters and then exits the bridge the value of A − B  increases by 1.  So after 3000 
cars have crossed the bridge, no further car can enter the bridge because 
A − B  ≥ 3000 + A0  − B0  ≥ 3(1000 − C0 ) + (A0  − B0 ) = T0 . 

After that, cars can only exit the bridge.  So after at most 3000+1000 transitions,  the system dead­
locks with the bridge empty but no cars allowed onto the bridge.

Problem 2. 
In  some  terms  when  6.042  is  not  taught  in  a  TEAL  room,  students  sit  in  a  square  arrangement 
during recitations.  An outbreak of beaver ﬂu sometimes  infects students  in recitation; beaver ﬂu

is a rare variant of bird ﬂu that lasts forever, with symptoms including a yearning for more quizzes 
and the thrill of late night problem set sessions. 
Here is an example of a 6× 6 recitation arrangement with the locations of infected students marked 
with an asterisk.

Outbreaks of infection spread rapidly step by step. A student is infected after a step if either 

•  the student was infected at the previous step (since beaver ﬂu lasts forever), or 

•  the student was adjacent to at least two already-infected students at the previous step. 

Here adjacent means the students’ individual squares share an edge (front, back,  left or right, but 
not diagonal). Thus, each student is adjacent to 2, 3 or 4 others. 
In the example, the infection spreads as shown below.

In this example, over the next few time-steps, all the students in class become infected. 
Theorem.  If  fewer  than  n  students  among  those  in  an  n × n  arrangment  are  initially  infected  in  a  ﬂu 
outbreak,  then  there will  be  at  least  one  student who never  gets  infected  in  this  outbreak,  even  if  students 
attend all the lectures. 

Prove this theorem. 
Hint: Think of the state of an outbreak as an n× n square above, with asterisks indicating infection. 
The rules for the spread of infection then deﬁne the transitions of a state machine.  Try to derive a 
weakly decreasing state variable that leads to a proof of this theorem. 

Solution.  Proof.  Deﬁne the perimeter of an infected set of students to be the number of edges with 
infection on exactly one side. Let ν  be size (number of edges) in the perimeter. 
We claim that ν  is a weakly decreasing variable.  This follows because the perimeter changes after 
a  transition only because  some  squares became newly  infected.  By  the  rules  above,  each newly-
infected  square  is  adjacent  to  at  least  two  previously-infected  squares.  Thus,  for  each  newly-
infected square, at  least two edges are removed from the perimeter of the  infected region, and at 

6 

Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 5, Fri. 

most two edges are added to the perimeter. Therefore, the perimeter of the infected region cannot 
increase. 
Now if an n × n grid is completely infected, then the perimeter of the infected region is 4n.  Thus, 
the whole grid can become infected only if the perimeter is initially at least 4n.  Since each square 
has perimeter 4, at least n squares must be infected initially for the whole grid to become infected.

Problem 3. 
Start  with  102  coins  on  a  table,  98  showing  heads  and  4  showing  tails.  There  are  two  ways  to 
change the coins: 

(i)  ﬂip over any ten coins, or 

(ii)  let n be the number of heads showing. Place n + 1 additional coins, all showing tails, on the 
table. 

For example, you might begin by ﬂipping nine heads and one tail, yielding 90 heads and 12 tails, 
then add 91 tails, yielding 90 heads and 103 tails. 

(a)  Model this situation as a state machine, carefully deﬁning the set of states, the start state, and 
the possible state transitions. 
Solution.  This  can  be  modeled  by  a  state  machine.  The  state  of  the  machine  is  the  number  of 
� 
heads and tails. The start state is (98, 4), and the transitions are: 
(h − a + (10 − a), t + a − (10 − a)) 
for 10 ≤ h + t&0 ≤ a ≤ min (10, h). 
(h, t + h + 1).

(b)  Explain how to reach a state with exactly one tail showing. 

Solution.  One way is to: 

· 
1.  Do operation 2 three times, yielding (98, 4 + 3  99) = (98, 301).
2.  Repeat 30 times: Do operation 1 to ﬂip 10 tails into heads. This will result in the state (398, 1), 
which is the desired state.

(d)  Prove that it is not possible to reach a state in which there is exactly one head showing. 

Solution.  We claimed above that H2  is an  invariant value,  that  is,  it does not change under state 
transitions.  To prove this, let (h, t) be a state with h even.  For the next state, we have two cases to 
consider: 
1.  The ﬁrst operation  is  executed:  (h, t)  →  (h − 2a + 10, t + 2a − 10).  Since −2a + 10  is  even, 
H2 ((h, t)) = H2 (h − 2a + 10, t + 2a − 10).

2.  The  second  operation  is  executed:  (h, t)
change in this case, so H2  does not change.

Since  the  initial number of heads,  98,  is even,  that  is, H2 ((98, 4))  =  0,  the  Invariant Method now 
implies that the number of heads in a reachable state is always even. But since one is odd, it is not 
possible to reach a state in which there is exactly one head showing.
