Introduction to 
Random Variables

Guess the Bigger Number 
Team 1:
• Write different integers between 0 and
     7 on two pieces of paper 
• Show to Team 2 face down 
Team 2:
• Expose one paper and look at number 
• Either stick or switch to other number 

Team 2 wins if gets larger number

Strategy for Team 2 

Analysis of Team 2 Strategy 

• pick a paper to expose giving each 
paper equal probability. 
• if exposed number is “small” then 
switch, otherwise stick.  That is 
  switch if  threshold Z where
Z  is a random integer, 0  Z  6.

Case M: low  Z < high
Team 2 wins in this case, so 
Pr{Team 2 wins | M} = 1
 and Pr{M} =

Analysis of Team 2 Strategy 

Case H: high  Z
Team 2 will switch, so wins iff
low card gets exposed 

Pr{Team 2 wins | H} =

Case L: Z < low 
Team 2 will stick, so wins iff
high card gets exposed 

Pr{Team 2 wins | L} =

So 1/7 of time, sure win. 
Rest of time, win 1/2, so 
Pr{Team 2 wins} =

Random Variables 
Informally: an RV is a number 
produced by a random process:
• threshold variable Z
• number of larger card 
• number of smaller card 
• number of exposed card

Random Variables 
Informally: an RV is a number 
produced by a random process:
• #hours to next system crash 
• #faulty chips in production run 
• avg # faulty chips in many runs 
• #heads in n coin flips

Intro to Random Variables 

Example: Flip three fair coins 
C ::= # heads (Count)

Intro to Random Variables 
Specify events using values of variables 
•[C = 1] is event “exactly 1 head” 
Pr{C = 1} = 3/8 
•Pr{C  1} = 7/8 
•Pr{C·M > 0} = Pr{M>0 and C>0}
    = Pr{all heads} = 1/8

Independent Variables 
random variables R,S
are independent iff

 [R = a], [S = b]
are independent 
events for all a, b

Independent Variables 

alternate version: 
Pr{R = a AND S = b} =
Pr{R = a} · Pr{S = b}

Binomial Random Variable 
Bn,p::= # heads in n independent flips.
Coin may be biased.  So 2 parameters 
n ::= # flips,
p ::=  Pr{head}. 
C is binomial for 3 flips: C is B3,1/2
for n=5, p=2/3
Pr{HHTTH} =
Pr{H}(cid:1)Pr{H}(cid:1)Pr{T}(cid:1)Pr{T}(cid:1)Pr{H}
            (by independence)

Uniform Distribution 

Team Problems 

R is uniform iff  PDFR  is constant.
R ::= outcome of fair die roll. 
Pr{R=1} = Pr{R=2} = ··· = Pr{R=6} = 1/6
S ::= 4-digit lottery number 
Pr{S = 0000} = Pr{S = 0001} = ···
           = Pr{S = 9999} = 1/10000
