Russell’s Paradox 

Now let s be W, and 
reach a contradiction: 

Disaster: Math is broken! 
I am the Pope, 
Pigs fly, 
and verified programs  
crash...

...but paradox is buggy 
Assumes that W is a set!

      …can only substitute 
      W for s if W is a set

...but paradox is buggy 
Assumes that W is a set!  
We can avoid the paradox, 
if we deny that W is a set! 
…which raises the key question:   
 just which well-defined 
 collections are sets?

Zermelo-Frankel Set Theory 

Zermelo-Frankel Set Theory 

No simple answer, but the  
axioms of Zermelo-Frankel  
along with the Choice axiom  
(ZFC) do a pretty good job. 

According to ZF, the elements 
of a set have to be “simpler” 
than the set itself.  In 
particular, 
no set is a member of itself.

Zermelo-Frankel Set Theory 

This implies that 
(1) the collection of all sets is not 
a set, and 
(2) W equals the collection of all 
sets …which is why it’s not a set 

infinite sizes 
Are infinite sets the “same size”? 
NO, by Russell paradox variant: 
Theorem: No surjective function 
from A to pow(A),  
  even for infinite A

no surjection from A to pow(A) 
Pf by contradiction:  suppose 
surj fcn f:A(cid:736)pow(A).  Let 
W::= {a ∈A | a ∉ f(a)}, so 
a ∈W iff a ∉ f(a). 
f a surj, so W=f(a0), some a0 ∈A. 
So,    a0 ∈f(a0) iff a0 ∉ f(a0).

 {0,1}ω is uncountable 
  A is countable iff can be 
listed  a0,a1,a2,….   
 same as surj fcn: N(cid:736)A 
So {0,1}ω is uncountable, because 
   → pow(N)
N →  {0,1}ω
