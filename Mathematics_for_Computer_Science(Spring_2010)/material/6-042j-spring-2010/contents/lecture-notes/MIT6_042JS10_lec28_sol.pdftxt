Problem 2.  (a)  Show  that  the  Magician  could  not  pull  off  the  trick  with  a  deck  larger  than  124

cards.

�  � 
Hint: Compare the number of 5-card hands in an n-card deck with the number of 4-card sequences.

Solution.  For a match to be possible with a n-card deck, the number,  n 
5  , of 5-card hands must be 
�  � 
at most as large as the number, (n)4 , of 4-card sequences.  So 
n
5 

(n)4 (n − 4)/5! = 

≤ (n)4 , 

which implies 

and hence n ≤ 124. 

n − 4 ≤ 5!

(b)  Show that, in principle, the Magician could pull off the Card Trick with a deck of 124 cards. 
Hint: Hall’s Theorem and degree-constrained (10.6.5) graphs. 

Solution.  In  principle  the  trick  is  possible  iff  the  bipartite  graph  between  5-card  hands  and  4­
card sequences has a matching  for  the hands.  In  this graph,  the degree of each hand  is 5!  =  120, 
whatever the size of deck. The degree of each sequence of 4 will be the number of cards remaining 
in the deck. With a deck of 124, there will be 120 cards remaining, so the degree of each sequence 
of 4 will also be 120.  Hence, the graph is degree-constrained, and so satisﬁes Hall’s condition for 
� 
a matching. 

Problem 3. 
The Magician  can determine  the  5th  card  in  a poker  hand when  his Assisant  reveals  the  other  4 
cards.  Describe a similar method for determining 2 hidden cards in a hand of 9 cards when your 
Assisant reveals the other 7 cards. 
Solution.  Since  there  must  be  �9/4�  = 3  cards  with  the  same  suit,  our  collaborator  chooses  to 
hide two of them and then use the third one as the ﬁrst card to be revealed.  So this ﬁrst revealed 
card ﬁxes the suit of the two hidden cards; it will also be used as the origin for the offset position 
of  the ﬁrst hidden  card.  This ﬁrst hidden  card will  in  turn be used  as  the origin  for  the offset of 
the other hidden card.  There are six cards  to code  the  two offset positions.  These sufﬁce  to code 
two offsets of size from one to six.  That is, our collaborator can choose one of the 3! = 6 orders in 
which to reveal the ﬁrst three cards and thereby tell us the offset position of the ﬁrst hidden card. 
Our collaborator can  then choose  the order of  the ﬁnal  three cards  to describe  the offset position 
of the second hidden card from the ﬁrst.  Note that the ﬁrst revealed card must be chosen so that 

Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 10, Wed.

both offsets are ≤ 6; since the sum of the offsets between successive cards ordered in a cycle from 
Ace  to King  is  13,  it  is  not  possible  for more  than  one  offset  between  successive  cards  to  exceed 
seven, so this is always possible.

Problem 4. 
Solve  the  following  counting  problems.  Deﬁne  an  appropriate mapping  (bijective  or  k-to-1)  be­
tween a set whose size you know and the set in question. 

(a)  An independent living group is hosting nine new candidates for membership. Each candidate 
must be assigned a task:  1 must wash pots, 2 must clean the kitchen, 3 must clean the bathrooms, 
1 must  clean  the  common  area,  and  2 must  serve dinner.  Write  a multinomial  coefﬁcient  for  the 
number of ways this can be done. 

Solution.  There  is  a  bijection  from  sequences  containing  one  P ,  two  K ’s,  three  B ’s,  a  C ,  and 
two D ’s.  In any such sequence,  the  letter  in  the  ith position speciﬁes  the  task assigned  to  the  ith 
� 
� 
candidate. Therefore, the number of possible assignments is: 
9 
::=
1, 2, 3, 1, 2 

9! 
1! 2! 3! 1! 2! 

� 

(b)  Write a multinomial coefﬁcient for the number of nonnegative integer solutions for the equa­
tion: 

x1  + x2  + x3  + x4  + x5  = 8. 

(1) 

Solution.  There  is  a  bijection  from  solutions  over N  for  (1)  to  bit  strings with  eight 0’s  and  four 
1’s. Namely, letting 0x  represent a string of x zeroes, 
(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 ) ∈ N5  �→ 0x1 10x2 10x3 10x4 10x5 
� �12 
4 

Therefore, there are 

nonnegative integer solutions to (1). 

� 

(c)  How  many  nonnegative  integers  less  than  1,000,000  have  exactly  one  digit  equal  to  9  and 
have a sum of digits equal to 17? 

Solution.  We  identify  the  nonnegative  integers  less  than  1,000,000  with  the  length  6  strings  of 
decimal digits. Then there is a bijection with pairs: 

(position of the 9, successive values of other 5 digits) 

Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 10, Wed. 

� � 
The sum of the other 5 digits is equal to 8, so the number of ways to choose their values is equal to 
� �12
the number of solutions over the nonnegative integers to (1), namely,  12  .  So by the product rule 
4 
there are 
6 · 
4 

such integers.
