In-Class Problems Week 8, Wed. 

Problem 1.  (a)  Use the Pulverizer to ﬁnd the inverse of 13 modulo 23 in the range {1, . . . , 22}. 
(b)  Use Fermat’s theorem to ﬁnd the inverse of 13 modulo 23 in the range {1, . . . , 22}. 

Problem 2.  (a)  Why is a number written in decimal evenly divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of 
its digits is a multiple of 9? Hint:  10 ≡ 1  (mod  9). 
(b)  Take a big number, such as 37273761261.  Sum the digits, where every other one is negated: 
3 + (−7) + 2 + (−7) + 3 + (−7) + 6 + (−1) + 2 + (−6) + 1 = −11 

Explain why the original number is a multiple of 11 if and only if this sum is a multiple of 11. 

Problem 3. 
The following properties of equivalence mod n follow directly from its deﬁnition and simple prop­
erties of divisibility.  See if you can prove them without looking up the proofs in the text. 
(a)  If a ≡ b  (mod  n), then ac ≡ bc  (mod  n). 
(b)  If a ≡ b  (mod  n) and b ≡ c  (mod  n), then a ≡ c  (mod  n). 
(c)  If a ≡ b  (mod  n) and c ≡ d  (mod  n), then ac ≡ bd  (mod  n). 
(d)  rem(a, n) ≡ a  (mod  n).
