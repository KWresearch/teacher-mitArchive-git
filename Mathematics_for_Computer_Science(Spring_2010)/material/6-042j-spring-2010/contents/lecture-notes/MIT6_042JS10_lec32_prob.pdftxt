Problem 1. 
The famous mathematician, Fibonacci, has decided to start a rabbit farm to ﬁll up his time while 
he’s  not making  new  sequences  to  torment  future  college  students.  Fibonacci  starts  his  farm  on 
month  zero  (being  a  mathematician),  and  at  the  start  of  month  one  he  receives  his  ﬁrst  pair  of 
rabbits.  Each pair of  rabbits  takes  a month  to mature,  and  after  that breeds  to produce one new 
pair of rabbits each month.  Fibonacci decides  that  in order never  to run out of rabbits or money, 
every  time a batch of new  rabbits  is born, he’ll sell a number of newborn pairs equal  to  the  total 
number of pairs he had three months earlier.  Fibonacci is convinced that this way he’ll never run 
out of stock. 

(a)  Deﬁne  the number,  rn , of pairs of  rabbits Fibonacci has  in month n, using a  recurrence  rela­
tion. That is, deﬁne rn  in terms of various ri  where i < n. 

(b)  Let R(x) be the generating function for rabbit pairs, 
R(x) ::= r0  + r1x + r2x 2  + ·. 

Express R(x) as a quotient of polynomials. 

(c)  Find a partial fraction decomposition of the generating function R(x). 

(d)  Finally, use  the partial  fraction decomposition  to come up with a closed  form expression  for 
the number of pairs of rabbits Fibonacci has on his farm on month n. 

Problem 2. 
Less well-known than the Towers of Hanoi —but no less fascinating —are the Towers of Sheboy­
gan. As in Hanoi, the puzzle in Sheboygan involves 3 posts and n disks of different sizes.  Initially, 
all the disks are on post #1: 

Post #1 

Post #2 

Post #3

The  objective  is  to  transfer  all  n  disks  to  post  #2  via  a  sequence  of  moves.  A  move  consists  of 
removing the top disk from one post and dropping it onto another post with the restriction that a 
larger disk can never lie above a smaller disk.  Furthermore, a local ordinance requires that a disk 
can be moved only from a post to the next post on its right —or from post #3 to post #1. Thus, for example, 
moving a disk directly from post #1 to post #3 is not permitted. 
(a)  One  procedure  that  solves  the  Sheboygan  puzzle  is  deﬁned  recursively:  to  move  an  initial 
stack of n disks to the next post, move the top stack of n − 1 disks to the furthest post by moving 
it  to  the  next  post  two  times,  then move  the  big,  nth  disk  to  the  next  post,  and  ﬁnally move  the 
top stack another two times to land on top of the big disk. Let sn  be the number of moves that this 
procedure uses. Write a simple linear recurrence for sn . 
(b)  Let S (x) be the generating function for the sequence �s0 , s1 , s2 , . . . �.  Show that S (x) is a quo­
tient of polynomials. 

(c)  Give a simple formula for sn . 

(d)  A better (indeed optimal, but we won’t prove this) procedure to solve the Towers of Sheboy­
gan  puzzle  can  be  deﬁned  in  terms  of  two  mutually  recursive  procedures,  procedure  P1 (n)  for 
moving a stack of n disks 1 pole forward, and P2 (n) for moving a stack of n disks 2 poles forward. 
This is trivial for n = 0.  For n > 0, deﬁne: 
P1 (n): Apply P2 (n − 1) to move the top n − 1 disks two poles forward to the third pole. Then move 
the remaining big disk once to land on the second pole.  Then apply P2 (n − 1) again to move the 
stack of n − 1 disks two poles forward from the third pole to land on top of the big disk. 
P2 (n):  Apply P2 (n − 1) to move  the  top n − 1 disks  two poles forward to  land on  the third pole. 
Then move the remaining big disk to the second pole.  Then apply P1 (n − 1) to move the stack of 
n − 1 disks one pole forward to land on the ﬁrst pole. Now move the big disk 1 pole forward again 
to land on the third pole.  Finally, apply P2 (n − 1) again to move the stack of n − 1 disks two poles 
forward to land on the big disk. 
Let  tn  be  the  number  of  moves  needed  to  solve  the  Sheboygan  puzzle  using  procedure  P1 (n). 
Show that 

tn  = 2tn−1  + 2tn−2  + 3, 

(1) 

for n > 1. 
Hint: Let sn  be the number of moves used by procedure P2 (n). Express each of tn  and sn  as linear 
combinations of tn−1  and sn−1  and solve for tn . 

(e)  Derive values a, b, c, α, β  such that 
tn  = aαn  + bβ n  + c. 

Conclude that tn  = o(sn ).

Partial Fractions 

3 

Here’s a particular case of the Partial Fraction Rule that should be enough to illustrate the general 
Rule. Let 

p(x) 
(1 − αx)2 (1 − βx)(1 − γx)3 
where α, β , γ  are distinct  complex numbers,  and p(x)  is a polynomial of degree  less  than  the de­
moninator, namely, less than 6. Then there are unique numbers a1 , a2 , b, c1 , c2 , c3  ∈ C such that

Finding a Generating Function for Fibonacci Numbers 

The Fibonacci numbers are deﬁned by: 

f0  ::= 0 
f1  ::= 1 
fn  ::= fn−1  + fn−2 

(for n ≥ 2) 

Let F  be the generating function for the Fibonacci numbers, that is, 
F (x) ::= f0  + f1x + f2x 2  + f3x 3  + · · · 

Now we have 

f1x  +  f2x2  +  f3x3  + · · ·  . 
F (x) =  f0  + 
3  − · · ·  . 
f0x  −  f1x
2  −  f2x
−xF (x) = 
− 
−  f0x −  f1x − · · ·  . 
−x2F (x) =

F (x)(1 − x − x2 ) =  f0  + (f1  − f0 )x  + 0x2  + 0x3  + · · ·  .

so 

F (x) =
