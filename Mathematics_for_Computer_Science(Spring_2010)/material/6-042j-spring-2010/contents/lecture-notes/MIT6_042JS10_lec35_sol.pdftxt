Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 13, Mon. 

Problem 1. 
Suppose there is a system with n components, and we know from past experience that any partic­
ular component will fail in a given year with probability p. That is, letting Fi  be the event that the 
ith component fails within one year, we have 
Pr {Fi} = p 
for  1  ≤  i  ≤  n.  The  system will  fail  if  any  one of  its  components  fails.  What  can we  say  about  the 
probability that the system will fail within one year? 

Let  F  be  the  event  that  the  system  fails  within  one  year.  Without  any  additional  assumptions, 
we can’t get an exact answer  for Pr {F }.  However, we can give useful upper and  lower bounds, 
namely, 
p ≤ Pr {F } ≤ np. 
We  may  as  well  assume  p <  1/n,  since  the  upper  bound  is  trivial  otherwise.  For  example,  if 
n  =  100  and  p  =  10−5 ,  we  conclude  that  there  is  at  most  one  chance  in  1000  of  system  failure 
within a year and at least one chance in 100,000. 
Let’s model this situation with the sample space S ::= P ({1, . . . , n}) whose outcomes are subsets of 
positive integers ≤ n, where s ∈ S  corresponds to the indices of exactly those components that fail 
within one year.  For  example,  {2, 5}  is  the  outcome  that  the  second  and ﬁfth  components  failed 
within  a  year  and  none  of  the  other  components  failed.  So  the  outcome  that  the  system did  not 
fail corresponds to the emptyset, ∅. 

(1) 

(a)  Show that the probability that the system fails could be as small as p by describing appropriate 
probabilities for the outcomes.  Make sure to verify that the sum of your outcome probabilities is 
1. 

Solution.  There  could  be  a  probability  p  of  system  failure  if  all  the  individual  failures  occur  to­
gether. That is, let Pr {{1, . . . , n}} ::= p, Pr {∅} ::= 1 − p, and let the probability of all other outcomes 
be zero. So Fi  = {s ∈ S  | i ∈ s} and Pr {Fi} = 0 + 0 + · · · + 0 + Pr {{1, . . . , n}} = Pr {{1, . . . , n}} = p. 
Also, the only outcome with positive probability in F  is {1, . . . , n}, so Pr {F } = p, as required.  � 

(b)  Show that the probability that the system fails could actually be as large as np by describing 
appropriate  probabilities  for  the  outcomes.  Make  sure  to  verify  that  the  sum  of  your  outcome 
probabilities is 1.

Solution.  Suppose at most one component ever fails at a time.  That is, Pr {{i}} = p for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 
Pr {∅}  = 1 − np, and probability of all other outcomes  is zero.  The sum of the probabilities of all 
the outcomes is one, so this is a well-deﬁned probability space. Also, the only outcome in Fi  with 
positive  probability  is  {i},  so  Pr {Fi}  =
Pr {{i}}
=  p  as  required.  Finally,  Pr {F }  =  np  because

Guess the Bigger Number Game 

Team 1: 

•  Write different integers between 0 and 7 on two pieces of paper. 

•  Put the papers face down on a table. 

Team 2: 

•  Turn over one paper and look at the number on it. 

•  Either stick with this number or switch to the unseen other number. 

Team 2 wins if it chooses the larger number.

Problem 2. 
In  section  20.2.3,  Team  2 was  shown  to have  a  strategy  that wins  4/7 of  the  time no matter how 
Team  1  plays.  Can  Team  2  do  better?  The  answer  is  “no,”  because  Team  1  has  a  strategy  that 
guarantees  that  it  wins  at  least  3/7  of  the  time,  no  matter  how  Team  2  plays.  Describe  such  a 
strategy for Team 1 and explain why it works. 
Solution.  Team 1 should randomly choose a number Z  ∈ {0, . . . , 6} and write Z  and Z + 1 on the 
pieces of paper with all numbers equally likely. 
To see why this works, let N  be the number on the paper that Team 2 turns over, and let OK be the 
event that N  ∈ {1, . . . , 6}.  So given event OK, that is, given that N  ∈ {1, . . . , 6}, Team 1’s strategy 
ensures  that  half  the  time N  is  the  higher  number  and  half  the  time N  is  the  lower  number.  So 
given event OK, the probability that Team 1 wins is exactly 1/2 no matter how Team 2 chooses to play 
(stick or switch). 
Now we claim that 

6
Pr {OK} = 
7
which implies that the probability that Team 1 wins is indeed at least (1/2)(6/7) = 3/7. 
To prove Pr {OK}  = 6/7, we can  follow  the  four step method.  (Note  that we couldn’t apply  this 
method  to  model  the  behavior  of  Team  2,  since  we  don’t  know  how  they  may  play,  and  so  we 
can’t let our analysis depend on what they do.) 
The  ﬁrst  level  of  the  probability  tree  for  this  game will  describe  the  value  of  Z :  there  are  seven 
branches from the root with equal probability going to ﬁrst level nodes corresponding to the seven 
possible values of Z .  The second  level of  the  tree describes  the choice of  the number, N :  each of 
the  seven ﬁrst-level nodes has  two branches with  equal probability,  one branch  for  the  case  that 
N  =  Z  and  the  other  for  the  case  that  N  =  Z  + 1.  So  there  are  14  outcome  (leaf)  nodes  at  the 
second level of the tree, each with probability 1/14.

Now only two outcomes are not OK, namely, when Z  = 6 and N  = 7, and when Z  = 0 and N  = 0. 
Each of  the other  twelve outcomes  is OK,  and  since each has probability 1/14, we  conclude  that 
Pr {OK} = 12/14 = 6/7, as claimed.

Problem 3. 
Suppose X1 , X2 , and X3  are three mutually independent random variables, each having the uni­
form distribution 
Pr {Xi  = k}  equal to 1/3 for each of k = 1, 2, 3. 
Let M  be another random variable giving the maximum of these three random variables. What is 
the density function of M ?

This can be hashed out by counting the possible outcomes. Alternatively, we can reason as follows: 
The  event M  = 1  is  the  event  that all  three of  the variables  equal 1,  and  since  they are mutually 
� �31
independent, we have

Pr {M  = 1}  =  Pr {X1  = 1} · Pr {X2  = 1} · Pr {X3  = 1} =

.

To  compute Pr {M  = 2}, we ﬁrst  compute Pr {M  ≤ 2}.  Now  the  event  [M  ≤  2]  is  the  event  that 
all three of the variables is at most 2, so by mutual independence we have � �32
Pr {M  ≤ 2}  =  Pr {X1  ≤ 2} · Pr {X2  ≤ 2} · Pr {X3  ≤ 2} =

Therefore, 

Finally,

Problem 4. 
Suppose you have a biased coin  that has probability p of ﬂipping heads.  Let J  be  the number of 
heads in n independent coin ﬂips.  So J  has the general binomial distribution: 
�  � 
p k q n−k 
n
k 

PDFJ (k) = 

where q ::= 1 − p. 

(a)  Show that 

PDFJ (k) < PDFJ (k + 1) 
PDFJ (k) > PDFJ (k + 1) 

for k < np + p, 
for k > np + p. 

Solution.  Consider the ratio of the probability of k heads over the probability of k − 1 heads.

This fraction is greater than 1 precisely when (n − k + 1)p > kq = k(1 − p), that is when k < np + p. 
So  for  k  <  np + p,  the  probability  of  k  heads  increases  as  k  increases,  and  for  k  >  np + p,  the 
� 
probability decreases as k  increases. 

(b)  Conclude that the maximum value of PDFJ  is asymptotically equal to

Hint:  For the asymptotic estimate,  it’s ok to assume that np  is an  integer, so by part (a) the maxi­
mum value is PDFJ (np). Use Stirling’s formula 15.121 .
