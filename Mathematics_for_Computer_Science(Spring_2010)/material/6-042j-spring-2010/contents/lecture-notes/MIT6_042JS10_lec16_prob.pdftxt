Problem 1. 
For each of  the  following pairs of graphs,  either deﬁne an  isomorphism between  them,  or prove 
that there is none.  (We write ab as shorthand for a—b.) 

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

G1  with V1  = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} , E1  = {12, 23, 34, 14, 15, 35, 45}

G2  with V2  = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} , E2  = {12, 23, 34, 45, 51, 24, 25}


G3  with V3  = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} , E3  = {12, 23, 34, 14, 45, 56, 26}

G4  with V4  = {a, b, c, d, e, f } , E4  = {ab, bc, cd, de, ae, ef , cf }


G5  with V5  = {a, b, c, d, e, f , g , h} , E5  = {ab, bc, cd, ad, ef , f g , gh, he, dh, bf }
G6  with V6  = {s, t, u, v , w, x, y , z} , E6  = {st, tu, uv , sv , wx, xy , yz , wz , sw, vz} 

Problem 2. 
Deﬁnition 10.2.5. A graph is connected iff there is a path between every pair of its vertices. 

False Claim.  If every vertex in a graph has positive degree, then the graph is connected. 

(a)  Prove that this Claim is indeed false by providing a counterexample. 

(b)  Since  the Claim  is  false,  there must be an  logical mistake  in  the  following bogus proof.  Pin­
point the ﬁrst logical mistake (unjustiﬁed step) in the proof. 

Bogus proof.  We  prove  the  Claim  above  by  induction.  Let  P (n)  be  the  proposition  that  if  every

vertex in an n-vertex graph has positive degree, then the graph is connected.

Base  cases: (n  ≤  2).  In  a  graph with  1  vertex,  that  vertex  cannot  have  positive  degree,  so  P (1)

holds vacuously.

P (2) holds because there is only one graph with two vertices of positive degree, namely, the graph

with an edge between the vertices, and this graph is connected.

Inductive step: We must show that P (n) implies P (n+1) for all n ≥ 2. Consider an n-vertex graph

in which every vertex has positive degree.  By the assumption P (n), this graph is connected;  that

is,  there  is  a  path  between  every  pair  of  vertices.  Now  we  add  one  more  vertex  x  to  obtain  an 
(n + 1)-vertex graph: 

All that remains is to check that there is a path from x to every other vertex z .  Since x has positive 
degree, there is an edge from x to some other vertex, y .  Thus, we can obtain a path from x to z by 
going from x to y and then following the path from y  to z . This proves P (n + 1). 
By the principle of induction, P (n) is true for all n ≥ 0, which proves the Claim.

Problem 3.  (a)  Prove that in every graph, there are an even number of vertices of odd degree. 
Hint: The Handshaking Lemma 10.1.3. 

(b)  Conclude  that at a party where some people shake hands,  the number of people who shake 
hands an odd number of times is an even number. 

(c)  Call  a  sequence  of  two  or more  different  people  at  the  party  a  handshake  sequence  if,  except 
for  the  last  person,  each  person  in  the  sequence  has  shaken  hands  with  the  next  person  in  the 
sequence. 
Suppose George was at  the party and has shaken hands with an odd number of people.  Explain 
why,  starting with George,  there must  be  a  handshake  sequence  ending with  a  different  person 
who has shaken an odd number of hands. 
Hint:  Just look at the people at the ends of handshake sequences that start with George.
