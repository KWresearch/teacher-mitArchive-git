Problem 1 (5 points). 

Prove that log4 9 is irrational. Your proof should be clear and well-organized, and should explicitly

indicate where particular properties of primes are assumed.


Solution.  Proof.  Suppose to the contrary that log4 9 = m/n for some integers m and n. Since log4 9

is positive, we may assume that m and n are also positive.  So we have


log4 9 = m/n 
4log4 9  = 4m/n 
9 = (4m )1/n 
9n  = 4m 

But this is impossible, since left hand side of (1) is odd, but the right hand side is even. 

This contradiction implies that log4 9 must be irrational.

Problem 2 (10 points). 
Let A  be  the  set  of  ﬁve  propositional  formulas  shown  below  on  the  left,  and  let C  be  the  set  of 
three  propositional  formulas  on  the  right.  Let  R  be  the  “implies”  binary  relation  from  A  to  C 
which is deﬁned by the rule 

F  R G 

iff 

[the formula (F  IM P L I E S  G) is valid]. 

For example,  (P  AND Q)  R P , because  the  formula (P  AND Q) does  imply P .  Also,  it  is not  true 
that (P  OR Q) R P  since [(P  OR Q) does not imply P . 

(a)  Fill in the arrows so the following ﬁgure describes the graph of the relation, R:

The proof is by contradiction. 
Suppose  to  the  contrary  that  this  failed  for  some  n  ≥  0.  Then  by  the  WOP,  there  is  a  smallest 
nonnegative integer, m, such this formula does not hold when n = m. 
But it clearly holds when n  = 0, which means that m  ≥  1.  So m − 1 is nonegative, and since it is 
smaller than m, the formula must be true for n = m − 1. That is, 
� (m − 1)m �2
