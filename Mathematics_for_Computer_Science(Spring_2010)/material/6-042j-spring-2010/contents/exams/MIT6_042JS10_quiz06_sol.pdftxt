Solutions to Mini-Quiz May 5 

Problem 1 (6 points). 

You  would  like  to  give  a  bouquet  for  Mother ’s  Day.  You  ﬁnd  an  online  service  that  will  make

bouquets of lilies, roses and tulips, subject to the following constraints:


•  there must be at most 3 lilies, 

•  there can be any number of roses, 

•  there must be a multiple of four tulips. 

Example: A bouquet of 4 tulips, 5 roses and no lilies satisﬁes the constraints. 
Let fn  be the number of possible bouquets with n ﬂowers that ﬁt the service’s constraints. Express 
F (x),  the  generating  function  corresponding  to  �f0 , f1 , f2 , . . . �,  as  a  quotient  of  polynomials  (or 
products of polynomials). You do not need to simplify this expression. 

Solution.  Generating function for the number of ways to choose lilies: 
1 − x4 
1 − x 

FL (x) = 1 + x + x 2  + x 3  =

Generating function for the number of ways to choose roses: 
· · · 

FR (x) = 1 + x + x 2  + x 3  + x 4  +

1 − x 

Generating function for the number of ways to choose tulips: 
· · · 

FW (x) = 1 + x 3  + x 7  +

1 − x4 

By the Convolution Property, the generating function for fn  is therefore the product of these func­
tions, namely, 

= 

F (x) = FL (x)FR (x)FW (x) 
(1 + x + x2  + x3 )
(1 − x)(1 − x2 ) 
(1 − x4 )
(1 − x)2 (1 − x4 )

(1 − x)2

Problem 2 (8 points). 
[A Baseball Series] 
The New  York  Yankees  and  the  Boston  Red  Sox  are  playing  a  two-out-of-three  series.  (In  other 
words, they play until one team has won two games. Then that team is declared the overall winner 
and the series ends.)  Assume that the Red Sox win each game with probability 2/3, regardless of 
the outcomes of previous games. 

Answer  the questions below using  the  four step method.  You can use  the same  tree diagram  for 
all three problems. 

(a)  What is the probability that only 2 games are played? 

Solution.  This  means  that  either  the  Yankees  win  both  games,  which  occurs  with  probability 
(1/3)2  or the Red Sox win both games, which occurs with probability (2/3)2 . 
Summing these yields (1/3)2  + (2/3)2  = 5/9 

� 

(b)  What is the probability that the winner of the series loses the ﬁrst game? 

Solution.  We use the four step method with the graph below. 

� 

(c)  What is the probability that the Red Sox loses the series? 

Solution.  A tree diagram is worked out below. 

(cid:52)(cid:80)(cid:89)(cid:1)(cid:56)(cid:74)(cid:79)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:56)(cid:74)(cid:79)(cid:79)(cid:70)(cid:83)(cid:1)(cid:45)(cid:80)(cid:84)(cid:85)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:39)(cid:74)(cid:83)(cid:84)(cid:85)(cid:1)(cid:40)(cid:66)(cid:78)(cid:70)(cid:89)(cid:89)(cid:89)Solutions to Mini-Quiz May 5

Problem 3 (6 points).

The following combinational identity is known as Pascal’s Triangle:

n − 1
n − 1
n
+ 
= 
k − 1 
k
k

(a)  Give a combinatorial proof that for Pascal’s Triangle. 

Solution.  Both sides are equal to: 

n!

k ! (n − k)!

(b)  Verify this combinational proof by giving an algebraic proof of this same fact. 

Solution.  This is identical to problem 16.12.1 in the notes, reproduced below: 
Jay ﬁgures that n people (including himself) are competing for spots on a team and only k will be 
selected. As part of maneuvering for a spot on the team, he needs to work out how many different 
teams are possible. There are two cases to consider: 
•	 Jay is selected for the team, and his k − 1 teammates are selected from among the other n − 1 
� 
� 
competitors. The number of different teams that can be formed in this way is: 
n − 1 
k − 1 
•	 Jay  is not  selected  for  the  team,  and  all  k  team members  are  selected  from  among  the  other 
� 
� 
n − 1 competitors. The number of teams that can be formed this way is: 
n − 1 
k

Solutions to Mini-Quiz May 5 

All teams of the ﬁrst type contain Jay, and no team of the second type does; therefore, the two sets 
�  � 
� 
� 
of teams are disjoint. Thus, by the Sum Rule, the total number of teams is: 
n − 1
n − 1 
+ 
k − 1 
k

Another way  of  thinking  about  it  is  that  n  people  (including  himself)  are  trying  out  for  k  spots. 
�  � 
Thus, the number of ways to select the team is simply: 
n 
k 
� 
�  �  � 
�  � 
Each method correctly counts the number of teams, so the answers must be equal.  So we know: 
n − 1
n − 1

= 
k − 1
