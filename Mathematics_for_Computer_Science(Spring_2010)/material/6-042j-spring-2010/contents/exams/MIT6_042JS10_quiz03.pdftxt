Problem 1 (8 points). 

Starting with some number of 4-cent and 7-cent stamps on the table, there are two ways to change

the stamps:


(i)  Add one 4-cent stamp, or 

(ii)  remove two 4-cent AND two 7-cent stamps (when this is possible). 

(a)  Let A be the number of 4-cent stamps; and B be the number of 7-cent stamps. The chart below 
indicates properties of some derived variables; ﬁll it in. 
4A + 7B  rem(B , 2)  rem(4 ∗ A + 7 ∗ B , 2) 

B 

derived variables: 
weakly increasing 
strictly increasing 
weakly decreasing 
strictly increasing 
constant 

(b)  Circle the properties below that are preserved invariants: 

1.  The number of 7-cent stamps (B ) must be even. 
2.  The number of 7-cent stamps (B ) must be greater than 0. 
3.  The total cost of stamps (4 ∗ A + 7 ∗ B ) must be odd. 
4.  4A > 7B . 

(c)  Using the Invariant Principle, show that it is impossible to have stamps with a total value of 
exactly 90 cents on the table when we start with exactly 211 7-cent stamps.  (You may use without 
proof the preserved invariance of some of the properties from part (b).)

Problem 2 (6 points). 

Covering edges were introduced in class problem:  if a and b are distinct vertices of a digraph, then

a is said to cover b if there is an edge from a to b and every path from a to b traverses this edge.  If a

covers b, the edge from a to b is called a covering edge.

Let D be a ﬁnite directed acyclic graph (DAG).


(a)  If there is a path in D  from a vertex, u, to vertex, v , explain why there must be a longest path 
from u to v . 

(b)  Give a proof of the following claim from the class problem: 
Claim.  If  there  is  a  path  in  D  from  a  vertex,  u,  to  vertex,  v ,  then  there  is  a  path  from  u  to  v  that  only 
traverses covering edges. 

(c)  Show that the Claim fails for the ﬁnite digraph, F , with three vertices and edges from every 
vertex to every other vertex. Hint: What are the covering edges of F ?

Problem 3 (6 points). 
Let G be a connected simple graph. Prove that if an edge in a connected graph is not traversed by 
any simple cycle, then it is a cut edge.1 

1A simple cycle is a subgraph of G isomorphic to the cycle graph Cn  for n ≥ 3. An edge is a cut-edge when removing 
the edge disconnects the graph.
