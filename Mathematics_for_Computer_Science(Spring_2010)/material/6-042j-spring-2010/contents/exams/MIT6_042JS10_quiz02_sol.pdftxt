Solutions to Mini-Quiz Mar.  3 

Problem 1 (6 points). 

Each year, Santa’s reindeer hold “Reindeer Games,”  from which Rudolph  is pointedly excluded.

The Games consist of a sequence of matches between pairs of reindeer. Draws are not possible.

On  Christmas  Eve,  Santa  produces  a  rank  list  of  all  his  reindeer.  If  reindeer  p  lost  a  match  to 
reindeer q , then p appears below q in Santa’s ranking, but if he has any choice because of unplayed 
matches,  Santa  can  give  higher  rank  to  the  reindeer  he  likes  better.  To  prevent  confusion,  two 
reindeer may not play a match if either outcome would lead to a cycle of reindeer, where each lost 
to the next. 
Though  it  is  only  March,  the  2010  Reindeer  Games  have  already  begun  (punctuality  is  key  at 
the north pole). We can describe the results so far with a binary relation, L, on the set of reindeer, 
where pLq means that reindeer p lost in a match to reindeer q . Let � be the corresponding indirectly 
lost relation, where reindeer p  indirectly  lost  to reindeer q when p  lost a match with q , or when p 
lost  to a  reindeer who  lost  to q , or when p  lost  to a  reindeer who  lost  to a  reindeer who  lost  to q , 
etc. Note that the “indirectly lost” relation, �, is a partial order. 

On the following page you’ll ﬁnd a list of terms and a sequence of statements. Add the appropriate 
term to each statement.

Problem 2 (7 points). 
Prove by  induction  that every exact amount of postage of 12 cents or more can be  formed using 3 
and 7 cent stamps.  In particular, clearly identify 

•  the induction variable, 

•  the induction hypothesis, 

•  the base case(s), and 

•  the inductive step. 

Solution.  Proof.  The following proof is by strong induction on n with induction hypothesis 

S (n) ::= exactly n cents postage can be formed using 3 and 7 cent stamps. 

Base cases: S (12), S (13) and S (14) are shown to hold by explicit calculations: 

12 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3, 
13 = 3 + 3 + 7, 
14 = 7 + 7. 

Inductive  step:  By  strong  induction,  we may  assume  that  S (k)  holds  for  12  ≤  k  ≤  n  and must 
then prove that S (n + 1) is true. 
Now  if n + 1  ≤  14,  then S (n + 1)  follows  from  the base  case.  On  the  other hand,  if n + 1  >  14, 
then n − 2  ≥  12,  so S (n − 2)  is  true  by  induction hypothesis.  So  by  adding  one  3  cent  stamp  to 
the stamps that form n − 2 cents postage, we will have postage equal to n − 2 + 3 =  n + 1 cents, 
showing that S (n + 1) is true. 
It follows by strong induction that P (n) holds for all n ≥ 14.

Problem 3 (7 points). 

Let  [N  → {1, 2, 3}]  be  the  set  of  inﬁnite  sequences  containing  only  the  numbers  1,  2,  and  3.  For

example, some sequences of this kind are:


(1, 1, 1, 1...), 
(2, 2, 2, 2...), 
(3, 2, 1, 3...). 

Prove that [N → {1, 2, 3}] is uncountable.

Hint: One approach is to deﬁne a surjective function from [N → {1, 2, 3}] to the power set P (N).

Solution.  Proof.  We can deﬁne a surjective function from f  : [N → {1, 2, 3}] → P (N) as follows:

f (s) ::= {n ∈ N  | s[n] = 1} 

where s[n] is the nth element of sequence s.

[N → {1, 2, 3}], then the composition of f  and

→ 
Now if there was a surjective function from g  : N 
g would be a surjective function from N to P (N) contradicting Theorem 5.2.1 in the text. 
� 
Proof.  Alternatively,  to  show  that  [N  → {1, 2, 3}]  is  uncountable,  we  show  that  no  function,  σ  : 
[N → {1, 2, 3}] is a surjection.  In particular, we will describe a sequence diag ∈ [N → {1, 2, 3}]
→
N 
such that diag ∈/ range (σ). 
Let 

σ0 , σ1 , . . . 
be the sequences in the range of σ . Then we can deﬁne diag as follows: 

diag ::= r(σ0 [0]), r(σ1 [1]), r(σ2 [2]), . . . , 
where r  : {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3} is some function such that r(i) =�
Now by deﬁnition, 

diag[n] =� σn [n], 
for all n ∈ N, proving that diag is not in the range of σ , as claimed. 

i for i = 1, 2, 3.
