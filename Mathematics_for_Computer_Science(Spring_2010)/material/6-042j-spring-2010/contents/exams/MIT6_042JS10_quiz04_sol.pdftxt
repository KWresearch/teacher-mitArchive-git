Solutions to Mini-Quiz Apr.  7 

Problem 1 (8 points).  (a)  Use the Pulverizer to ﬁnd gcd(84, 108) 

Solution.  Here is the table produced by the Pulverizer: 
rem(x, y) =	 x − q y· 
24  =  1 108 − 1  84
·
· 
12 =  −3  108 + 4  84
·
· 
0

y

(b)	 Find integers x, y with 0 ≤ y < 84 such that 
·
· 
x  84 + y  108 = gcd(84, 108).

Solution.  From the table above, 

4  84 − 3  108 = gcd(84, 108).
·
· 

� 

Therefore, 

(4 − 108  k)  84 + (−3 + 84  k)  108 = gcd(84, 108).
·
· 
·
· 
So, letting k = 1, (x, y) = (4 − 108  1, −3 + 84  1) = (−104, 81) works.	
·
· 
(c)  Find  the multiplicative  inverse  of  84 modulo  108  in  the  range  {1,...,107}.  If  no  such  inverse 
can be found, brieﬂy explain why not. 

�

Solution.  There is no inverse of 84 modulo 108. The inverse of a modulo m exists iff gcd(a, m) = 1. 
� 
Clearly gcd(84, 108) = 12 = 1
, so there is no inverse of 84 modulo 108. 

Problem 2 (6 points).  (a)  For the planar embedding picture below, list all the discrete faces (sim­

(b)  Provide a drawing of a different planar embedding of the graph above.  Also list all the faces 
of the embedding. 

Solution.  The planar drawing below has the following faces: adea, abea, befb, bcgfb, cfgc, abcfeda

Problem 3 (6 points). 

Deﬁnition.  Consider  a  new  recursive  deﬁnition,  MB0 ,  of  the  same  set  of  “matching”  brackets 
strings as MB  (deﬁnition of MB  is provided in the Appendix): 
•  Base case:  λ ∈ MB0 . 
•  Constructor cases: 

(i)  If s is in MB0 , then [s] is in MB0 . 
(ii)  If s, t ∈ MB0 , s =� λ, and t =� λ, then st is in MB0 . 
(a)  Suppose structural induction was being used to prove that MB0  ⊆ MB .  Circle the one predi­
cate below that would ﬁt the format for a structural induction hypothesis in such a proof. 
•  P0 (n) ::= |s| ≤ n IM P L I E S  s ∈ MB . 
•  P1 (n) ::= |s| ≤ n IM P L I E S  s ∈ MB0 . 
•  P2 (s) ::= s ∈ MB . 
•  P3 (s) ::= s ∈ MB0 . 
•  P4 (s) ::=  (s ∈ MB  IM P L I E S  s ∈ MB0 ). 
Solution.  MB0  ⊆ MB means that ∀s ∈ MB0 . s ∈ MB . To prove this, the only hypothesis above that 
ﬁts the format for a structural induction would be P2  in a structural induction on the deﬁnition of 
� 
MB0 . 

(b)  The recursive deﬁnition MB0  is ambiguous.  Verify this by giving two different derivations for 
the string ”[ ][ ][ ]” according to MB0 . 
Solution.  MB0  is ambiguous because ”[ ][ ][ ]” ∈ MB0  can be derived from the second constructor 
� 
with s = [ ] and t =  [ ][ ], but also with s =  [ ][ ] and t = [ ].
