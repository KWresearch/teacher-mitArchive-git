Problem 1 (6 points). 

You  would  like  to  give  a  bouquet  for  Mother ’s  Day.  You  ﬁnd  an  online  service  that  will  make

bouquets of lilies, roses and tulips, subject to the following constraints:


•  there must be at most 3 lilies, 

•  there can be any number of roses, 

•  there must be a multiple of four tulips. 

Example: A bouquet of 4 tulips, 5 roses and no lilies satisﬁes the constraints. 
Let fn  be the number of possible bouquets with n ﬂowers that ﬁt the service’s constraints. Express 
F (x),  the  generating  function  corresponding  to  �f0 , f1 , f2 , . . . �,  as  a  quotient  of  polynomials  (or 
products of polynomials). You do not need to simplify this expression.

Problem 2 (8 points). 
[A Baseball Series] 
The New  York  Yankees  and  the  Boston  Red  Sox  are  playing  a  two-out-of-three  series.  (In  other 
words, they play until one team has won two games. Then that team is declared the overall winner 
and the series ends.)  Assume that the Red Sox win each game with probability 2/3, regardless of 
the outcomes of previous games. 
Answer  the questions below using  the  four step method.  You can use  the same  tree diagram  for 
all three problems. 

(a)  What is the probability that only 2 games are played? 

(b)  What is the probability that the winner of the series loses the ﬁrst game? 

(c)  What is the probability that the Red Sox loses the series?
