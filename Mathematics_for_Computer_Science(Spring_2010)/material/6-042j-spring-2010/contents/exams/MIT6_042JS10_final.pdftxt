Problem 1 (Probable Satisﬁability) (10 points).

A literal is a propositional variable or its negation. A k-clause is an OR of k literals, with no variable

occurring more than once in the clause.  For example,


is a 4-clause, but 

P  OR Q OR R OR V , 

V  OR Q OR X  OR V , 

is not, since V  appears twice. 
Let S be a set of n distinct k-clauses involving v variables. The variables in different k-clauses may 
overlap or be completely different, so k ≤ v ≤ nk . 
A random assignment of true/false values will be made independently to each of the v variables, 
with true and false assignments equally likely. Write formulas in n, k , and v  in answer to the ﬁrst 
two parts below. 
(a)  (2 points) What is the probability that the last k-clause in S  is true under the random assign­
ment? 

(b)  (3 points)  What is the expected number of true k-clauses in S ?

Problem 3 (Graph Coloring & Induction) (10 points).

Recall that a coloring of a graph is an assignment of a color to each vertex such that no two adjacent

vertices have the same color. A k-coloring is a coloring that uses at most k colors.

False Claim.  Let G be  a graph whose vertex degrees  are  all ≤  k .  If G has  a vertex  of degree  strictly  less 
than k , then G is k-colorable. 

(a)  (2 points)  Give a counterexample to the False Claim when k = 2. 

(b)  (4 points) Underline the exact sentence or part of a sentence that is the ﬁrst unjustiﬁed step in 
the following “proof ” of the False Claim. 

False proof.  Proof by induction on the number n of vertices: 
Induction hypothesis: 
P (n)::=  “Let G  be  an n-vertex graph whose vertex degrees  are  all ≤  k .  If G  also has  a vertex  of

degree strictly less than k , then G is k-colorable.”

Base case: (n = 1) G has one vertex, the degree of which is 0.  Since G is 1-colorable, P (1) holds.

Inductive step:

We may  assume P (n).  To prove P (n + 1),  let Gn+1  be  a graph with n + 1 vertices whose vertex

degrees are all k or less. Also, suppose Gn+1  has a vertex, v , of degree strictly less than k . Now we

only need to prove that Gn+1  is k-colorable.

To  do  this,  ﬁrst  remove  the  vertex  v  to  produce  a  graph,  Gn ,  with  n  vertices.  Let  u  be  a  vertex

that  is  adjacent  to  v  in  Gn+1 .  Removing  v  reduces  the  degree  of  u  by 1.  So in  Gn ,  vertex  u  has

degree  strictly  less  than  k .  Since  no  edges  were  added,  the  vertex  degrees  of  Gn  remain  ≤  k .

So Gn  satisﬁes  the  conditions  of  the  induction  hypothesis,  P (n),  and  so we  conclude  that Gn  is

k-colorable.

Now a k-coloring of Gn  gives a coloring of all the vertices of Gn+1 , except for v . Since v has degree

less than k , there will be fewer than k  colors assigned to the nodes adjacent to v .  So among the k

possible colors,  there will be a color not used to color these adjacent nodes, and this color can be

�

assigned to v  to form a k-coloring of Gn+1 .

(c)  (4 points) With a slightly strengthened condition, the preceding proof of the False Claim could 
be revised into a sound proof of the following Claim: 
Claim.  Let  G  be  a  graph  whose  vertex  degrees  are  all  ≤  k .  If  �statement inserted from below�  has  a 
vertex of degree strictly less than k , then G is k-colorable. 
Circle each of the statements below that could be inserted to make the Claim true. 

•  G is connected and 
•  G has no vertex of degree zero and 
•  G does not contain a complete graph on k vertices and 
•  every connected component of G 
•  some connected component of G

Problem 4 (Planar Embeddings) (10 points).

The planar graph embeddings in class (repeated in the Appendix) were only deﬁned for connected

planar graphs. The deﬁnition can be extended to planar graphs that are not necessarily connected

by adding the following additional constructor case to the deﬁnition:

•	 Constructor Case:  (collect disjoint graphs) Suppose E  and F  are planar embeddings with no 
vertices in common. Then E ∪ F  is a planar embedding. 

Euler ’s  Planar  Graph  Theorem  now  generalizes  to  unconnected  graphs  as  follows:  if  a  planar 
embedding, E , has v vertices, e edges, f  faces, and c connected components, then 
v − e + f  − 2c = 0.

This can be proved by structural induction on the deﬁnition of planar embedding. 

(a)  (4 points) State and prove the base case of the structural induction. 

(b)  (2  points) Carefully  state what must  be  proved  in  the  new  constructor  case  (collect  disjoint 
graphs) of the structural induction. 

(c)  (4 points) Prove the (collect disjoint graphs) case of the structural induction.

Problem 6 (Magic Trick Redux) (10 points).

In  this problem we  consider  the  famous 6.042 magic  trick.  Unlike  the one performed  in  class by

the TAs,  this time the Assistant will be choosing 4 cards and revealing 3 of them to the Magician

(in some particular order) instead of choosing 5 and revealing 4.


(a)  Show that the Magician could not pull off this trick with a deck larger than 27 cards. 

(b)  Show  that,  in principle,  the Magician could pull off  the Card Trick with a deck of exactly 27 
cards.  (You do not need to describe the actual method.)

subsets?

(b)  (4 points) 
n
Here is a combinatorial proof of an equation giving a closed form for a certain summation 
i=0 : 
There are n marbles, each of which is to be painted red, green, blue, or yellow. One way 
to assign colors is to choose red, green, blue, or yellow successively for each marble. 
An alternative way to assign colors to the marbles is to 
•	 choose a number, i, between 0 and n, 
•	 choose a set, S , of i marbles, 
•	 divide S  into two subsets; paint the ﬁrst subset red and the other subset green. 
•	 divide the set of all the marbles not in S  into two subsets; paint the ﬁrst subset blue 
and the other subset yellow. 

What is the equation? 

(c)  (4 points) Now use the binomial theorem to prove the same equation.

Problem 8 (Linear Recurrence) (10 points).

Less well-known than the Towers of Hanoi —but no less fascinating —are the Towers of Sheboy­

gan. As in Hanoi, the puzzle in Sheboygan involves 3 posts and n disks of different sizes.  Initially,

all the disks are on post #1:


Post #1 

Post #2 

Post #3 

The  objective  is  to  transfer  all  n  disks  to  post  #2  via  a  sequence  of  moves.  A  move  consists  of 
removing the top disk from one post and dropping it onto another post with the restriction that a 
larger disk can never lie above a smaller disk.  Furthermore, a local ordinance requires that a disk 
can be moved only from a post to the next post on its right —or from post #3 to post #1. Thus, for example, 
moving a disk directly from post #1 to post #3 is not permitted. 

(a)  (2  points) One  procedure  that  solves  the  Sheboygan  puzzle  is  deﬁned  recursively:  to move 
an initial stack of n disks to the next post, move the top stack of n − 1 disks to the furthest post by 
moving it to the next post two times, then move the big, nth disk to the next post, and ﬁnally move 
the top stack another two times to land on top of the big disk. Let sn  be the number of moves that 
this procedure uses. Write a simple linear recurrence for sn .

The hat-check staff has had a long day serving at a party, and at the end of the party they simply

return people’s hats at random. Assume that n people checked hats at the party.

Let Xi  be  the  indicator variable  for  the  ith person getting  their own hat back.  Let Sn  be  the  total

Problem 10 (Sampling & Conﬁdence) (10 points). 
Yesterday, the bakers at a local cake factory baked a huge number of cakes. To estimate the fraction, 
b, of cakes in this program that are improperly prefared, the cake-testers will take a small sample 
of cakes chosen randomly and independently (so it is possible, though unlikely, that the same cake 
might be chosen more than once). For each cake chosen, they perform a variety of non-destructive 
tests to determine if the cake is improperly prepared, after which they will use the fraction of bad 
cakes in their sample as their estimate of the fraction b. 
The  factory  statistician  can  use  estimates  of  a  binomial  distribution  to  calculate  a  value,  s,  for  a 
number of  cakes  to  sample which ensures  that with 97% conﬁdence,  the  fraction of bad  cakes  in 
the sample will be within 0.006 of the actual fraction, b, of bad cakes in the back. 
Mathematically,  the  batch  is  an  actual  outcome  that  already  happened.  The  sample  is  a  random 
variable  deﬁned  by  the  process  for  randomly  choosing  s  cakes  from  the  batch.  The  justiﬁcation 
for the statistician’s conﬁdence depends on some properties of the batch and how the sample of s 
cakes from the batch are chosen.  These properties are described in some of the statements below. 
Mark each of these statements as T (true) or F (false), and then brieﬂy explain your answer. 

1.  The probability that the ninth cake in the batch is bad is b. 

2.  All cakes in the batch are equally likely to be the third cake chosen in the sample. 

3.  The probability that the ninth cake chosen for the sample is bad, is b. 

4.  Given  that  the  ﬁrst  cake  chosen  for  the  sample  is  bad,  the  probability  that  the  second  cake 
chosen will also be bad is greater than b. 

5.  Given  that  the  last  cake  in  the  batch  is  bad,  the  probability  that  the  next-to-last  cake  in  the 
batch will also be bad is greater than b.

6.  Given that the ﬁrst two cakes selected in the sample are the same kind of cake —they might 
both be chocoloate, or both be angel food cakes,. . . —the probability that the ﬁrst cake is bad 
may be greater than b. 

7.  The expectation of the indicator variable for the last cake in the sample being bad is b. 

8.  There is zero probability that all the cakes in the sample will be different.
