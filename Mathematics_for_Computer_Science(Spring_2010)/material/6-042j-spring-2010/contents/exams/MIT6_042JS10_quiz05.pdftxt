Problem 1 (13 points).

The queen and king of hearts decide to host a poker game and invite their six fellow royals —the

queen and king of clubs, diamonds, and spades. The queen of hearts has a round table with eight

chairs P1 , P2 , . . . , P8  for these eight people:


You may answer each of the following questions with a numerical expression that uses factorials 
and arithmetic operations. 

(a)  In how many ways can the queen assign the eight people to different chairs? 

A seating is a circular arrangement of people around the table in which all that matters is who sits 
next to whom, not which chairs they are in.  In other words, two ways of assigning people to chairs 
deﬁne the same seating when one assignment is a rotation of the other.  For example, the following 
two assignments of people to chairs deﬁne the same seating: 

P8 
P6  P7 
P4  P5 
P2  P3 
P1 
K♠  Q♠  K♥  Q♥  K♦  Q♦  K♣  Q♣ 
K♦  Q♦  K♣  Q♣  K♠  Q♠  K♥  Q♥ 
(b)  How many different seatings are there?

(c)  How many distinct  seatings  are  there  if  the queen  and king of hearts must be  seated next  to 
each other?  Hint:  Think of the queen and king as one unit, but remember the king and queen can 
be in either order. 

(d)  How many distinct  seatings  are  there  if  the queen  and king of hearts must be  seated next  to 
each other, and the queen and king of spades must also be seated next to each other? 

(e)  How many distinct seatings are there where no one is seated next to their spouse? 
Hint: Let N1  be the answer to part (c), N2  the answer to part (d), N3  be the number of seatings with 
each  of  the ♠,  ♥,  and ♦  couples  seated  next  to  their  spouses,  and N4  be  the  number  of  seatings 
with everyone next to their spouse.  Use inclusion-exclusion and express your answer in terms of 
the Ni ’s.
