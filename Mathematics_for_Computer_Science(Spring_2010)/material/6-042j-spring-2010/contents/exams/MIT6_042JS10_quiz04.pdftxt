Problem 1 (8 points).  (a)  Use the Pulverizer to ﬁnd gcd(84, 108) 

(b)	 Find integers x, y with 0 ≤ y < 84 such that 
·
· 
x  84 + y  108 = gcd(84, 108).

(c)  Find  the multiplicative  inverse  of  84 modulo  108  in  the  range  {1,...,107}.  If  no  such  inverse 
can be found, brieﬂy explain why not.

Problem 2 (6 points).  (a)  For the planar embedding picture below, list all the discrete faces (sim­
ple cycles that deﬁne the region borders). 

(b)  Provide a drawing of a different planar embedding of the graph above.  Also list all the faces 
of the embedding.

Mini-Quiz Apr.  7 

Deﬁnition.  Consider  a  new  recursive  deﬁnition,  MB0 ,  of  the  same  set  of  “matching”  brackets 
strings as MB  (deﬁnition of MB  is provided in the Appendix): 

•  Base case:  λ ∈ MB0 . 
•  Constructor cases: 

(i)  If s is in MB0 , then [s] is in MB0 . 
(ii)  If s, t ∈ MB0 , s =� λ, and t =� λ, then st is in MB0 . 
(a)  Suppose structural induction was being used to prove that MB0  ⊆ MB .  Circle the one predi­
cate below that would ﬁt the format for a structural induction hypothesis in such a proof. 
•  P0 (n) ::= |s| ≤ n IM P L I E S  s ∈ MB . 
•  P1 (n) ::= |s| ≤ n IM P L I E S  s ∈ MB0 . 
•  P2 (s) ::= s ∈ MB . 
•  P3 (s) ::= s ∈ MB0 . 
•  P4 (s) ::=  (s ∈ MB  IM P L I E S  s ∈ MB0 ). 

(b)  The recursive deﬁnition MB0  is ambiguous.  Verify this by giving two different derivations for 
the string ”[ ][ ][ ]” according to MB0 .

Recursively deﬁne the set, MB, of strings of “matching” brackets as follows: 

•  Base case:  λ ∈ MB. 
•  Constructor case:  If s, t ∈ MB, then [s]t ∈ MB.
