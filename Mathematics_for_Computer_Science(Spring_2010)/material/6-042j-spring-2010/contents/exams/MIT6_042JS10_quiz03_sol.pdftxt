Problem 1 (8 points). 

Starting with some number of 4-cent and 7-cent stamps on the table, there are two ways to change

the stamps:


(i)  Add one 4-cent stamp, or 

(ii)  remove two 4-cent AND two 7-cent stamps (when this is possible). 

(a)  Let A be the number of 4-cent stamps; and B be the number of 7-cent stamps. The chart below 
indicates properties of some derived variables; ﬁll it in.

(b)  Circle the properties below that are preserved invariants: 

1.  The number of 7-cent stamps (B ) must be even. 
2.  The number of 7-cent stamps (B ) must be greater than 0. 
3.  The total postage (4A + 7B ) on the table must be odd. 
4.  4A > 7B .

(c)  Using the Invariant Principle, show that it is impossible to have stamps with a total value of 
exactly 90 cents on the table when we start with exactly 211 7-cent stamps.  (You may use without 
proof the preserved invariance of some of the properties from part (b).) 

Solution.  We will  show  that  the  predicate  (3) must  hold  for  all  reachable  states  of  the  state ma­

chine.

First, we check that the predicate holds for the start state:

·
· 
rem(211  7 + 0  4, 2) = rem(1477, 2) = 1 

So the total cost of stamps was clearly odd in the start state. 
Since (3) is a preserved invariant that holds for the start state, it must hold for all reachable states 
of the machine. 
However, since the predicate does not hold for the state of having exactly 90 cents, it is not a reach­
able state and it is therefore impossible to have exactly 90 cents on the table.

Problem 2 (6 points). 

Covering edges were introduced in class problem:  if a and b are distinct vertices of a digraph, then

a is said to cover b if there is an edge from a to b and every path from a to b traverses this edge.  If a

covers b, the edge from a to b is called a covering edge.

Let D be a ﬁnite directed acyclic graph (DAG).


(a)  If there is a path in D  from a vertex, u, to vertex, v , explain why there must be a longest path 
from u to v . 
Solution.  If D  has m  vertices,  then  no  path  can  be  longer m − 1 —otherwise  some  vertex must 
repeat on the path, which means there would be a cycle, contradicting the fact that D is a DAG. So 
there must be a longest path from u to v .  (Technically, this follows from the Well Ordering Principle 
applied to the set {v − n ∈ N  | there is a path of length n from u to v}.) 
� 

(b)  Give a proof of the following claim from the class problem: 
Claim.  If  there  is  a  path  in  D  from  a  vertex,  u,  to  vertex,  v ,  then  there  is  a  path  from  u  to  v  that  only 
traverses covering edges. 

Solution.  By  part  (a),  there  is  a  longest  path  from  u  to  v .  If  some  edge  on  this  path  was  not  a 
covering  edge,  then  by deﬁnition  there  is  a path  of  length  2  or more  between  its  endpoints,  and 
replacing this edge by the path would yield a  longer path from u to v , a contradiction.  Hence all 
� 
edges must be covering edges. 

(c)  Show that the Claim fails for the ﬁnite digraph, F , with three vertices and edges from every 
vertex to every other vertex. Hint: What are the covering edges of F ? 
→
Solution.  There are no covering edges in F , since for each edge u
v there is a length 2 path uwv 
through the remaining vertex, w , that does not traverse this edge.  So there is no path of covering 
� 
edges from any vertex to any other vertex.

Problem 3 (6 points). 
Let G be a connected simple graph. Prove that if an edge in a connected graph is not traversed by 
any simple cycle, then it is a cut edge.1 

Solution.  Proof.  Supppose  edge  u—v  is not  a  cut-edge.  We  show  that  it must  be  traversed  by  a 
simple cycle. 
Since the edge is not a cut-edge, the graph obtained by removing the edge is connected.  So there 
exists a path from u to v which does not traverse u—v . We proved in lecture that the shortest such 
path  from  u  to  v  must  be  simple.  But  this  simple  path  together with  u—v  is  a  simple  cycle  that 
traverses u—v . 

� 

1A simple cycle is a subgraph of G isomorphic to the cycle graph Cn  for n ≥ 3. An edge is a cut-edge when removing 
the edge disconnects the graph.
