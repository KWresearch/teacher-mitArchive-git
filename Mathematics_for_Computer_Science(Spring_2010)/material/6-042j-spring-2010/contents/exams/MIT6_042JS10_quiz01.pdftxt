Problem 2 (10 points). 
Let A  be  the  set  of  ﬁve  propositional  formulas  shown  below  on  the  left,  and  let C  be  the  set  of 
three  propositional  formulas  on  the  right.  Let  R  be  the  “implies”  binary  relation  from  A  to  C 
which is deﬁned by the rule 

F  R G 

iff 

[the formula (F  IM P L I E S  G) is valid]. 

For example,  (P  AND Q)  R P , because  the  formula (P  AND Q) does  imply P .  Also,  it  is not  true 
that (P  OR Q) R P  since (P  OR Q) does not imply P . 

(a)  Fill in the arrows so the following ﬁgure describes the graph of the relation, R:
