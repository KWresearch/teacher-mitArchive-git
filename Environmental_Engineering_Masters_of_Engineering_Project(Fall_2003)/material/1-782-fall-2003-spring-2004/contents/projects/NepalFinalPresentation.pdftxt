Lab Test Results

• The results from these tests support the 
hypothesis that colloidal silver helps to 
inactivate coliform bacteria – in the short 
term. 
• A lot more lab and field testing is required
– Long term testing
– Challenge testing
– Colloidal Silver effectiveness over time 

Product Marketing

• Partner with educators
• Develop a strong brand name
• Emphasize superior performance
• Marketing targeted towards women
• Seed product in schools and with persons of 
status
• Can a presence/absence test be used as a 
sales tool?

Safe Household Drinking Water via BioSand Filtration
Pilot Project Evaluation &
Feasibility Study of a BioSand Pitcher Filter
Melanie Pincus 

12

BioSand Filter Overview

- Designed by Dr. David Manz
at the University of Calgary, 
Alberta, Canada

- Specifically for use by poor
people in developing countries.

- Relies on natural biological,
chemical and physical
mechanisms to purify water.

Pilot Project Evaluation

- Evaluate performance of recently installed concrete 
BioSand filters.

13

Pilot Project Potential

- Communities interested in and accepting of BioSand technology.
- All filters had high turbidity removal.
- Flow rates varied from 1.0 – 37.5 L/hr.
- Results from microbial analyses mixed (n = 9).
- 2 filters at 99% E. coli removal from highly contaminated 
- raw water.
- 3 filters contaminating relatively clean source water.

- One day of testing insufficient to adequately characterize BioSand
-filter performance.  Regular, repeated samplings of source water, 
-filtered water and water in collection buckets should be performed on 
these household units. 

Feasibility Study of a 
BioSand Pitcher Filter
- Conceptualized as a smaller,
cheaper alternative to the 
concrete BioSand filters.
- A potential interim measure
as households mobilize funds
for a larger capacity water filter.

- Field and laboratory 
experiments
to evaluate pitcher filter viability 
by cross-checking performance
with concurrent performance of
commercially available filters.

14

Evaluation of Three Arsenic 
Removal Technologies in 
Nepal

16

Research Objectives

• Technical Evaluation: Arsenic removal 
and flow rate. 
• Social Evaluation: Survey Questionnaire 
to evaluate arsenic awareness and 
social acceptability of each filter
• Economic Evaluation: willingness-to-pay

Three-Kolshi Filter

• First studied in 
Nepal by Jessica 
Hurd in 2001

Arsenic-Biosand Filter

• Invented by Tommy 
Ngai (M.Eng.2002)
• Won Lemelson
International 
Technology Award 
(2002)
• Pilot Scale 
implementation in 
Fall 2002 

18

TECHNICAL EVALUATION

• All filters have good arsenic removal 
rates (>90%)
• Flow rates differ:
- Arsenic-Biosand: 10 to 20 L/hr
- 3-Kolshi: 0.5 to 3L/hr
• Confirmation of previous studies

SOCIAL EVALUATION

• Surveyed 54 families
• 3 Districts
• 3 Different Technologies
• Used a survey questionnaire of 10-20 
questions depending on technologies

CONCLUSIONS

• Good level of arsenic awareness
• Good social acceptability of each filter
• Arsenic-Biosand Filter is most appropriate.
• However, cost is above willingness-to-pay
– If filters distributed for free or subsidized: 
Arsenic-Biosand is best option
– If filters sold: 3-Kolshi for small families and 
Arsenic-Biosand for big families.

in water due to:
– UV-A radiation ( λ
from 315 to 400  η m) 
– Synergistic effect with temperature
• Variations:
– Exposure time 
– Clear, black or reflective surface

DIFFICULTIES FOUND
• Lack of E. coli due to extreme cold.
• Finding the “right” materials.
• Three week study -- limited data set and 
many variables:
– Solar radiation
– Flow rate
– Concentration of pollutants

28

CONCLUSIONS

• Technical: SC-SODIS is technically 
feasible in region studied based on data 
collected.
• Construction: Found local materials 
(Butwal and Lumbini). 
• Social: Preliminary feedback showed local 
people preferred SC-SODIS to SODIS.
• Economic: Construction costs below $0.50 
(NRs 300).

RECOMMENDATIONS

• Find a local manufacturer of SC-SODIS 
system to reduce construction time.
• Further study of flow rates.
• Study during monsoon season.

Water
Hillary Green

Carpet Industry in Nepal

• One of Kathmandu Valley’s largest 
industries (50 carpet manufacturers)
• Dye wastewater often sent directly to 
rivers
• Synthetic dyes are usually preferred over 
natural dyes
• Most synthetic carpet dyes contain 
chromium, copper or cobalt

35

Do Carpet Dyes Cause Significant 
Water Quality Deterioration of the 
Bagmati River ?

• Identify sites of carpet manufacturers 
along the Bagmati
• Test and collect relevant water quality data
– absorbance
– chromium
– COD
– DO

Sampling Points Along the Bagmati

• Decreasing dye waste to the Bagmati

• Further studies needed to determine

Effects of Detergent Use on Water 
Quality in Kathmandu, Nepal

Amanda Richards

Overview of Guheshwori WWTP
• Only operating municipal WWTP in Nepal
• Activated sludge process with 17.3 MLD 
capacity
• Foaming problem in aeration tanks, location 
of oxygen supply
• Possible culprits:
- Filamentous bacteria
- Anionic surfactants 
in synthetic detergents 

39

Surfactant Analysis
• Two classifications of anionic surfactants:
– Very slowly degraded, causes foaming 
problems (ABS)
– Easily biodegraded, no foaming problems (LAS)
• Surfactant Analysis
– 19 laundry detergents collected from Nepal
– Test for total anionic surfactants
– Monitor surfactant degradation with time
– Remaining surfactant considered to be ABS

Surfactant Analysis, Continued
• Estimate detergent effects:
• Instructions suggest 1 handful detergent/half-bucket 
water
• Approximately 25 g detergent/4 L water (6.25 g/L)
• With persistent surfactant levels of 5 mg/g detergent, 
estimate 32 mg ABS/L wash water
• ABS foaming limit is ~0.5 mg ABS/L water
• Difficult to estimate the frequency of household 
laundry washing (# loads/family-wk)
• Analysis done assuming 1 load/family-wk, 5 
loads/family-wk and 10 loads/family-wk

41

Surfactant Conclusions
• Laundry detergent not a likely major contributor to 
foaming at Guheshwori WWTP
– Probable dilution to concentrations below foaming limit
– Detergent biodegradability meets standards set by 
United States and European Governments
• Other possible causes of foaming for future study:
– Surfactants used in industrial detergents (textile and 
carpet industries)
– Filamentous bacteria

Phosphates Analysis
• Detergents analyzed for phosphates
– Evaluate contribution to eutrophication in the 
Bagmati River
• Average concentration of 402 mg PO4/kg 
detergent, or 2.5 mg PO4/L wash water
• PO4 levels from washing laundry are 
insignificant compared to Bagmati River 
concentrations (reach as high as 1.6 mg/L)
– Analyzed at 1, 5 and 10 loads/family-wk

• Reasons for failure of large treatment plants:
– High Cost
– Inefficient gov’t water/ WW bureaucracy
– Inappropriate transfer of 1st World technology 
to 3rd World conditions

• Small and decentralized treatment plants are 
high in demand 

• Constructed Wetlands introduced in Nepal in 
1997 by a local NGO research institute, ENPHO, 
as a cheap alternative (Laber, Haberl, Shrestha

Conclusions

• Treatment performance of CW is good

• More accurate determination of Kr value and 
detention time will enable even better 
performance and improved design in future

• CW has a high potential to address 
wastewater treatment needs in Nepal
