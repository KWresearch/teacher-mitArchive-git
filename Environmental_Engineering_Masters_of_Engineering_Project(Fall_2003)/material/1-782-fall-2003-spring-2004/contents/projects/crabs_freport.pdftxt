I. INTRODUCTION 

Christopher  Columbus  first  discovered  the  US  Virgin  Islands  in  1493  (Donahue  and  Johnston, 
1998).  During his second voyage to the Americas Columbus arrived at St Croix (formerly called 
Santa  Cruz).  Sailing  further  north,  he  found  endless  islands  and  christened  them  Las  Islas 
Virgenes,  The  Virgin  Islands.  In  the  1500’s,  resistance  to  outside  settlers  caused  war  and  the 
destruction  of  the  native  population.  Denmark  established  the  first  European  settlement  in  St. 
Thomas  in  671.    In  1733,  Denmark  purchased  St.  Croix  from  the  French  crown,  unifying  the 
three  Virgin  Islands.  From  1733  to  1750  sugar  cane  production,  rum  production,  and  the  slave 
industry  experienced  economic  prosperity.  As  a  result  of  water  scarcity  and  decreasing  soil 
fertility,  agriculture  production  began  to  decline  in  1750.  In  1750,  St.  Thomas  became  the 
marketplace  of  the  Caribbean  due  to  its  excellent  harbor.    1848  to  1878  were  a  time  of  turmoil 
and  economic  decline  plagued  with  illness  and  hurricanes.  In  order  to mitigate  harbor  pollution 
and  epidemics,  the  first  channel  was  built  in  Charlotte  Amalie,  St.  Thomas  to  increase  water 
movement. 

The  United  States  purchased  the  three  islands  of  St.  Croix,  St.  Thomas,  and  St.  John  from 
Denmark  for 25 million dollars  in 1917,  forming  the US Virgin  Islands  (Donahue  and  Johnston, 
1998).  Purchase  of  the  islands  was  part  of  a  military  strategy  to  stop  Germany  from  installing 
submarine  bases.  US  citizenship  was  granted  to  the  islanders  in  1927.  In  the  1950’s  tourism 
accounted  for  over  50  percent  of  the  island’s  economy.  The  1960’s  brought  about  various 
changes in the US Virgin Islands.  Hess Oil established a refinery on St. Croix, resulting in rapid 
economic growth.  Due  to  increased demand for clean water on  the  islands,  the first desalination 
plant  was  built  in  1962.  The  promulgation  of  the  Virgin  Islands  Safe  Drinking  Water  Act  in 
1975  brought  about  specific  monitoring  and  quality  requirements  for  the  island’s  water 
distribution.  Presently,  the  overall  water  demand  is  not  met  by  desalination.  The  use  of 
rainwater  cisterns  and  some  groundwater  wells  supplement  this  demand.    In  1996,  the  U.S. 
Virgin  Islands  government  signed  a  consent  decree  with  the  U.S.  Environmental  Protection 
Agency  in  order  to  increase  compliance  of  the  effluent  from  the  islands’  wastewater  treatment 
facilities with water quality standards. 

Per  our  proposal  dated  December  9,  2002,  the  Caribbean  Research  Association  for  the 
Betterment of Water reSources (CRABS) is submitting this report regarding water quality of salt 
ponds in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and water resources management in the U.S. Virgin Islands and 
Haiti.  After  reviewing  your  request,  CRABS  assembled  a  team  of  engineers  and  scientists  to 
address  your  concerns  regarding  the  water  quality  status  of  wetland  areas  and  watershed 
management  on  the  islands  of  St.  John,  St.  Thomas,  and Haiti  due  to  an  increased  need  for  this 
information  by  local  managers,  contractors,  and  planners.  Team  members  from  CRABS  have 
the experience necessary  to provide quality and comprehensive solutions for  the USVI Wetlands 
Association.  Our  experience  lies  in  water  quality  analysis,  watershed  modeling  and  analysis, 
groundwater  and  sediment  analysis,  geographic  information  systems  application,  and  water 
resources master planning. 

Knowing  that  wetlands  and  water  resources  are  precious  and  scarce  in  the  Caribbean,  CRABS 
developed the following mission statement. 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources 

11 

To  study  and  understand  the  water  resources  in  the  Caribbean  so  they  can  be 
maintained and preserved. 

During  the  course  of  this  project  CRABS  has  gathered  data  to  assess  the  present  conditions  of 
water quality, desalination, and water resources on St. John, St. Thomas, St. Croix and Haiti, and 
will develop strategies to address each of these areas. 

A description of  the study and  its results are described  in further detail  in  the following sections.  
Section  II  presents  the  results  of  our  evaluation  of  the  Safe  Water  System  for  point-of-use 
drinking  water  treatment  in  Haiti;  Section  III  presents  evaluations  of  water  resources 
management  on  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands;  and  Section  IV  describes  studies  of  the  water  quality, 
ecology,  and  hydrology  of  salt  ponds  on  St.  John  in  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands.  Further  detail  on 
these  studies  is  provided  in  the  following Master  of Engineering  theses:  Brin  (2003), Bossi  and 
Rose  (2003),  Buscemi  (2003),  Cheslek  (2003),  Gangemi  (2003),  Miilu  (2003),  and  Stevens

II.  WATER RESOURCES – HAITI 

WHY A SAFE WATER SYSTEM IN HAITI? 
CONTEXT 
Haiti  has  a  long  history  of  political  and  economic  instability.  Therefore,  few  international 
monetary aid agencies have been willing  to  invest  in Haiti.   As a result, access  to safe water and 
sanitation  is available  to only 50 percent of  the population.  Unsafe drinking water causes illness 
and  can  be  lethal  for  children. 
In  Haiti,  this  is  reflected  in  only  45  and  54  years  of  life 
expectancy  and  118  and  103  per  thousand  births  infant  mortality  rates  for  Haitian  males  and 
females, respectively (WHO, 2003). 

In reaction to the cholera epidemic that strangled South America in 1992, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention  (CDC) and  the Pan American Health Organization  (PAHO) developed a 
point-of-use water  treatment  called  the  Safe Water  System  (SWS)  (CDC,  2002).   The  SWS  is  a 
low cost solution using simple technology that provides clean drinking water, which could easily 
be  implemented  in  Haiti.    The  SWS  is  a  combination  of:  1)  water  treatment  with  locally 
produced  sodium  hypochlorite  disinfectant,  2)  safe  storage  of  the  drinking  water  in  adapted 
containers, and 3) community education. 

THE SAFE WATER SYSTEM IN JOLIVERT 
Missions  of  Love  Incorporated  (MOL)  is  a  not-for-profit  evangelical  Christian  mission  (MOL, 
2003).  Its  president,  Dr.  Robert  Johnson  (“Dr.  Bob”),  and  his  wife  Betty  Johnson,  have  been 
working in Northern Haiti for the past fifteen years.  Four years ago, MOL decided to build their 
own  clinic,  and  now  is  providing  health  care  for  Haitians  in  the  Jolivert  area.  William  Gallo, 
who  has  worked  with  water  projects  throughout  Haiti  for  more  than  five  years,  was  invited  by 
MOL  to  start  an  in-home  water  purification  program  in  Jolivert  and  the  surrounding 
communities, which would be based at the clinic. 

Jolivert  is  a  village  located  on  the  shore  of  the  Trois-Rivieres  River,  in  northwestern  Haiti  (see 
Figure  1).  The  river  provides  a  large  amount  of water  low  in  suspended  sediments,  a  condition 
necessary  for  optimizing  the  electrolysis  process.  Weekly  electrolytic  chlorine  solution 
production  under  such  conditions  could  easily  supply  2000  families.  Since  Jolivert  has  only 
about  300  households,  the  targeted  area  reaches  many  surrounding  villages  from  Bassin  Bleu 
(about 2 miles north of Jolivert) to Frage (about 2 miles south of Jolivert). 

The  Jolivert  Safe  Water  for  Families  (SWF)  project  began  in  January  2002  with  a  preliminary 
study  of  the  local  population.  After  locating  a  Haitian  supplier  for  buckets  to  adapt  as  SWS 
containers  and  importing  bottles  in  which  to  store  the  hypochlorite  solution  and  other  materials 
needed  in  order  to  start  the  project,  a  pilot  project  was  implemented  with  200  participating 
households in December 2002.

FIGURE 1 
MAP OF HAITI 
(World Bank, 2002) 

The project  is run by  local personnel.  Christophe Velcine, who works as a  laboratory  technician 
at  the  clinic,  directs  the  project  and  handles  the  administrative  and  material  management  work. 
Elédère  Odin  is  the  SWS  full-time  technician  who  prepares  and  sells  the  hypochlorite  solution. 
He  also  visits  the  homes  and  ensures  the  transmission  and  understanding  of  educational 
information throughout the community. 

In  April  2002,  an  initial  meeting  was  held  by  Dr.  Bob  Johnson  and  Bill  Gallo  with  community 
leaders  to  explain  the  project.  In  September  2002, Christophe  and  Elédère  explained  the  use  of 
the  buckets  and  associated  health  issues  with  the  first  twenty  people  to  receive  systems.    Then, 
Christophe  and Elédère  conducted  a  series  of meetings  and  distributed  the  remainder  of  the  200 
SWS  buckets  that  were  to  be  used  for  the  pilot  project.  Elédère  then  began  visits  to  the 
households  to  verify  that  the  system  was  being  used  properly  and  that  users  were  aware  of  the 
health implications of unsafe water. 

The  locally  generated  hypochlorite  solution  is  called  Dlowòks.  A  highly  concentrated  chlorine 
solution  currently  used  in  Haiti  is  called  Klowòks,  which  is  a  calcium  hypochlorite  solution. 
“Dlo” means “water” in Haitian Creole.  Dlowòks therefore suggests clean water through using a 
chlorine solution. 

The special SWS containers used in the pilot project are adapted from buckets similar to the ones 
Haitians normally use to store water.  They are standard plastic 5-gallon (20-liter) buckets.  They 
meet many of the CDC criteria, but not all.  The CDC recommends a translucent material for the 
bucket;  however,  the  bucket  used  in  Jolivert  is  opaque.  The CDC  also  recommends  an opening 
large enough to facilitate filling and cleaning though small enough to prevent even children from 
dipping  out water  out with  a  cup.  The  bucket  used  in  Jolivert  has  a wide  opening  that  does  not

meet  this  requirement.  Another  issue  is  that  the  lid needs holes drilled  in  it  to  let air enter since 
when  it  is  completely  closed,  suction  prevents  water  from  flowing  through  the  spigot.  The 
bucket and chlorine bottle used in Jolivert for the Safe Water System are presented in Figure 2. 

FIGURE 2 
JOLIVERT SWS MATERIAL 

JOLIVERT’S SOURCES OF DRINKING WATER 
As  mentioned  earlier,  Jolivert  and  the  nearby  communities  are  located  along  the  Trois-Rivieres 
River.  It is no surprise that the river constitutes the main source of water for the population. 

Most people harvest their drinking water from what they call “sous dlo”, the Haitian Creole word 
for  “spring  water.”  This  choice  of  wording  shows  that  the  Haitian  people  differentiate 
groundwater  and  surface  water.  However,  the  “sous  dlo”  is  not  a  groundwater  spring,  but  only 
river  water  filtered  by  the  soil.  People  dig  a  small  hole  in  a  dry  spot  in  the  riverbed  and  wait 
until  it  fills  with  water  (Figure  3).  They  then  harvest  it  with  a  bowl  or  a  glass  to  fill  their 
buckets. 

Groundwater  sources,  true  springs,  are  also  available  for  drinking  water.    Three  groundwater 
sources  were  mentioned  during  surveys:  De  Riyon,  La  Boule,  and  Tiboukan.  De  Riyon  is 
located near La Hatte, about a 20-minute walk  from  the clinic, but on  the other side of  the  river.   
La Boule  is on  Jolivert’s  side of  the  river, but  is  in  the hills above La Boule district, about a 30­
minute  walk  from  the  clinic.  Tiboukan  is  just  north  of  Bassin  Bleu,  but  we  did  not  have  the 
chance to visit it.

OBJECTIVES OF THE RESEARCH 
CRABS  proposed  to  evaluate  future  possibilities  for  the  Safe  Water  System  of  Jolivert.  The 
goals of the study are: 

1.  Evaluate the Safe Water System in Jolivert 
2.  Evaluate possibilities for growth of the project 

In  order  to  reach  these  goals,  CRABS  conducted  a  health  survey  by  interviewing  fifty-six 
households  that  use  the  Safe  Water  System  and  sixty-four  that  are  not  included  in  the  pilot 
project.  For each household, questions related to their water and sanitation practices were asked.  
Also,  two  samples  of  their  drinking  water  were  collected  to  run  membrane  filtration  tests  on 
later.  The  results  of  these  survey  and  bacteriological  analyses  guided  our  evaluation  and  helped 
us suggest adequate possibilities for the growth of the Safe Water System to a larger scale. 

SURVEY RESULTS 
This  section  summarizes  the  main  results  that  were  found  from  the  survey.  We  analyzed  the 
answers  in  a  way  to  point  out  the  positive  and  negative  outcomes  of  implementing  the  Safe 
Water  System  from  a  health  perspective.    Also,  we  identified  different  sanitary  practices  that 
improve health, regardless of the quality of drinking water consumed. 

DESCRIPTION OF THE SURVEYED POPULATION 
In  the  first  question  of  the  survey, we  asked  for  the  age  and  gender  of  the  people  residing  in  the 
household.  The total population surveyed was distributed as shown in Table 1.

It  seems  that  the  number  of  children  under  five  is  low  compared  to  the  other  age  categories.  In 
fact,  some  people  did  not  mention  their  presence  in  the  house  until  it  was  specifically  asked. 
Therefore,  some may  have  been  omitted.    This  omission may  be  a  sign  that  children  under  five 
are not considered since their survival is so uncertain, as previously mentioned. 

The  majority  (52  percent)  of  the  surveyed  people  reported  to  have  two  rooms  per  household. 
This  proportion  is  similar  for  those with  and without  the  system.  Also,  only  10  households  out 
of  120  had  electricity.  These  two  metrics  suggest  that  the  people  surveyed  had  the  about  the 
same socio-economic status.   

HEALTH 
Question 14 was one of the most important of the survey.  This question determined the diarrhea 
incidences by age group (Table 2).

Families  with  the  Safe  Water  System  had  40  percent  fewer  diarrhea  incidences  than  the 
population without  the system.  However, no  improvement  is seen  in  the main  target population, 
children  under  five  years  old.  Moreover,  these  children  do  not  see  significant  health  benefits 
even  when  the  system  is  used  correctly,  that  is  to  say  when  there  was  chlorine  residual  in  the 
water.  Our  hypothesis  regarding  the  issue  of  no  health  benefits  for  children  under  five  is  that 
children under five are exposed  to bacteriological contamination by means other  than water with 
or without  the  system.  Therefore,  a  Safe Water  System will  not  prevent  them  from  contracting 
diarrhea if no sanitary improvement is done.

DRINKING WATER 
From  the  total  120  homes we  visited,  109  (91  percent)  took  their  drinking water  from  the  “sous 
dlo.”  Six  were  taking  it  from  the  “sous”  plus  other  places  such  as  harvesting  rain  water, 
groundwater  or  directly  from  the  river.  Seven  people  (6  percent)  said  their  primary  source  of 
drinking water was  from  a  groundwater  source  and  three  (3  percent)  said  it was  their  secondary 
source  of  water.    Only  one  person  reported  getting  their  water  directly  from  the  river.  Two  (2 
percent)  said  rain was  their  primary  source  of water.  It  is  a  little  unfortunate  to  see  that  almost 
nobody harvests rainwater though this is surely due to the absence of inexpensive cisterns.  Also, 
only very few people use groundwater as their primary drinking water source. 

In  addition,  63  percent  of  the  total  population  (71  households)  thought  that  the  harvested  water 
was good for drinking.  Fifty percent of the people who do not have the system use an alternative 
way  to  treat  their  water.  Though,  even  if  some  of  this  50  percent  gave  answers  that  were  not 
true, it shows, at least, a certain degree of concern. 

STORAGE AND HANDLING 
Eighty  percent  of  the  people  without  the  system  and  without  diarrhea  say  they  use  a  specific 
container  for  their  drinking water,  compared  to  only  60  percent  for  the  ones without  the  system 
but with  diarrhea  incidences.  Since  people without  the  system  have  to  dip  into  the  container  to 
scoop out water, when water is used exclusively for drinking, there is less exposure to hands (and 
bacteria) and there is more attention to keeping the water clean.  Therefore, using this water only 
for drinking can prevent people  from contracting diarrhea.   However,  the  reverse happens  in  the 
“with the system” category.  The people with the system but without diarrhea use the clean water 
for more  purposes  than  the  ones with  diarrhea.  In  that  case,  due  to  the  presence  of  a  spigot,  the 
potential contamination due  to frequent handling of  the water  is reduced.   Therefore, using clean 
water for many purposes will help reduce diarrhea incidences. 

Moreover, it is noticed that there are fewer diarrhea incidences when people scoop their drinking 
water with a  tool  that has a handle.   The cup,  the pitcher,  the direct spill or  the mug, and  the use 
of  a  spigot  put  together  show  a  higher  rate  of  “no  diarrhea”  (55  percent)  compared  to  people 
using a tool without a handle (48 percent).  In fact, a scoop with a handle reduces the risk that the 
hand  touches and contaminates  the water.  By  the  same means,  it  reduces  the  risk of contracting 
diarrhea. 

Regardless  of  the  tool  used  to  scoop  out water  from  the  container, we  also  asked  people  if  they 
ever  touched  the  water  when  scooping  it  out.    From  that  question,  we  see  a  net  difference 
between  the ones who did and  the ones who did not have diarrhea  incidences.  That  is  to say, 85 
percent  of  those  who  did  not  have  diarrhea  did  not  touch  the  water  with  their  hands  while 
scooping  out  water,  compared  to  only  45  percent  for  the  ones  with  diarrhea.    This  is  evidence 
that hands transport bacteria and contaminate the drinking water. 

Education  towards  safe  sanitary  practices  could  help  increase  the  health  benefits  brought  by  a 
SWS.  People should be aware of safe storage and handling of the drinking water, such as using a 
tool  with  a  handle  to  scoop  water  out  of  the  container  and  not  touching  the  water  with  hands 
before drinking it.

QUESTIONS SPECIFIC TO THE HOUSEHOLDS WITH THE SAFE WATER SYSTEM 
The majority of  the households are using  the  system properly.  Only one person  reported adding 
2 caps full of Dlowòks per bucket and 95 percent (42 out of 44 households) add only one, which 
is  the  necessary  quantity.  The  12  for  whom  we  do  not  have  specifications  on  the  quantity  of 
Dlowòks they add to the water are the ones where the interviewee was not the one taking care of 
this duty. 

Another  interesting  fact  is  that  when  only  one  person  is  responsible  for  adding  the  Dlowòks, 
there  is  less  chance  to  develop  diarrhea.    Particularly  when  women  are  responsible,  there  are 
fewer  diarrhea  incidences  in  the  family.  In  fact,  for  the  category  of  people  without  diarrhea, 
females were  responsible  for  adding  the Dlowòks  in  94  percent  of  the  cases  (29  households out 
of 31) compared to only 72 percent in the category of people with diarrhea. 

CHLORINE RESIDUAL RESULTS 
The chlorine residual test verifies that there is a chlorine residual in the drinking water.  Chlorine 
reacts with the bacteria molecules and other oxidizable matter in the water until there is either no 
more chlorine to react or no more bacteria to inactivate.  If the chlorine residual test indicates the 
presence of  residual chlorine,  it means  that  there are no more bacteria.  On  the other hand,  if  the 
test shows no presence of free chlorine, there is a possibility that bacteria remain in the water. 

The  chlorine  residual  tests  were  conducted  with  a  colorimetric  swimming  pool  test  kit.  After 
adding one drop of the testing solution, a yellow color develops in the presence of chlorine.  Our 
analysis  relies  on  the  following  grading  of  color:  a)  no  coloration,  b)  pale  yellow,  c)  yellow,  d) 
dark  yellow,  and  e)  very  dark  yellow/orange.  The  plastic  vial  in  which  the  test  was  performed 
was rinsed with the household’s drinking water before performing the test. 

Fifty-five  percent  of  the  population  had  a  normal  level  of  chlorine  residual  in  their  drinking 
water, which includes level b) and c) as explained previously.  However, 33 percent did not have 
any chlorine  residual, and 7 percent had  too much chlorine  in  their water.  The  three households 
with no answers are the ones in which there was not enough water to do the chlorine residual test 
when we  visited  them.  It  is  interesting  to  point  out  that people with no  chlorine  residual have  a 
higher  rate  of  diarrhea  incidence  (60  percent  or  11/18)  than  those  with  chlorine  residual  (35 
percent or 12/35).  This shows the importance of the chlorine residual in the drinking water. 

BACTERIOLOGICAL RESULTS 
Almost  every  household  provided  a  sample  of  their  drinking  water.    Seven,  however,  did  not 
have drinking water at  the moment of  the  interview.  The samples were stored  in a cooler  for no 
longer  than  four  hours,  and  a membrane  filtration  test was  conducted  in  the  laboratory  set  up  in 
the clinic. 

This membrane filtration test consists of filtering a specific amount of water through a membrane 
filter  (pore  size  0.45mm), which  traps  the  bacteria  (Maier  et  al.,  2000).  The  filter  is  then  placed 
in  a  petri  dish  saturated  with  a  culture  medium,  which  enhances  the  growth  of  certain  bacteria. 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources 

19 

The  petri  dishes  are  then  incubated  for  18  to  24  hours  (24  hours  in  our  case)  at  35�C  to  let  the 
microbial  colonies  grow.  The  culture  medium  used  is  mColiBlue24  broth,  from  Millipore 
Corporation.  It grows E. coli colonies blue and the remaining total coliform colonies red. 

Table  3  shows  that  the  system  improves  the  quality  of  water.  In  fact,  the  mean  total  coliform 
forming  units  (cfu)  is  reduced  by  a  factor  of  10  while  the  E.  coli  forming  units  are  reduced  by 
factor  of  20.  Also,  if  one were  to  take  out  all  households where  there was  no  chlorine  residual, 
the mean drops to 35 cfu for total coliform and to ~0 cfu for E. coli (only one household had one 
cfu).  This shows that the Dlowòks is very efficient at killing bacteria.

The  answers  to  the  health  survey  are  not  significantly  different  for  those  who  have  no  chlorine 
residual  than  the  rest  of  the  population.  The  main  difference  is  that  this  category  of  the 
population  has  a  higher  rate  of  diarrhea  incidences  (65  percent)  compared  to  the  rest  of  the 
people  with  the  safe  water  system  (35  percent).  This  shows  the  importance  of  the  chlorine 
residual in the drinking water. 

CRABS also verified that the farthest people had no chlorine residual more often than the others.  
As  was  expected,  four  out  of  the  five  households  of  Bassin  Bleu  who  had  water  did  not  have 
chlorine residual.  However, the situation is not as bad in the other communities.  This is possibly 
because Bassin Bleu is more urban the other communities, and its residents do not tend to go out 
of town as often as people who live far from services.  The issue of providing Dlowòks to remote 
regions will be discussed in the next section. 

PROJECT GROWTH ANALYSIS 
After  we  compared  the  surveys  on  health  issues  and  analyzed  the  bacteriological  results,  we 
completed  a  preliminary  analysis  and  presented  some  early  results  of  our  study  to  the  Jolivert 
Safe  Water  System  staff.  After  hearing  our  report,  we  joined  the  staff  in  a  discussion  of  the 
issues  raised by  the  report.  The meeting  included Bill Gallo, Christophe Velcine, Eledere Odin, 
Madame Evelyn, Daniele Lantagne, and Genevieve Brin. 

One  of  the  main  issues  in  expanding  the  program  is  that  a  new  bucket  is  too  expensive  for  the 
majority  of  the  families.  Since  most  people  already  store  their  drinking  water  in  buckets, 
CRABS  recommends  that  it  be  possible  for  them  to  join  the  program  without  buying  another 
bucket.  Used buckets could be adapted for Safe Water System storage by adding taps and labels 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources 

20 

with directions for use.  However, for people who do not have buckets, it is our recommendation 
that they buy one to prevent the administrative complications of loaning buckets. 

Another  issue  is how  to make  it  easer  for people  some distance  from  the  clinic  to buy Dlowòks. 
Results  from  the  survey  showed  that  this  problem  is  especially  apparent  in  Bassin  Bleu,  where 
people  tend  to  refill  their  chlorine  bottles  less  often.  CRABS  suggests  that  small  shops  sell  the 
Dlowòks  solution,  and  supply  it  at  a  higher  price  to  provide  profit  for  the  kiosk  owner.  A 
permanent  provider  of  Dlowòks  in  regions  some  distance  from  the  clinic  will  enable  customers 
to obtain Dlowòks when they need it and possibly increase the proportion of people using it. 

Finally, another issue is whether or not schools should enter the program during the early stages. 
The consensus was  that  the educational benefits would be great, but  the health benefits might be 
minimal  since most of  the  students would not have  systems at home, at  least at  the beginning of 
the  project.  CRABS  recommends  that  schools  be  included  in  the  project  expansion  plan.  Their 
participation  in  the  SWS  project  would  be  mostly  educational,  and  students  should  be  involved 
in promoting the SWS along with sanitary practices. 

CONCLUSION 
From a health perspective, the use of the SWS reduces diarrhea incidence by 40 percent.  If there 
is  chlorine  residual  in  the  drinking  water,  diarrhea  incidences  are  reduced  by  60  percent. 
However,  it  does  not  reduce  diarrhea  incidences  for  children  under  five  years  old,  which  is  the 
main  target  age-category  population.    It  is  hypothesized  that  this  age  group  is  exposed  to 
pathogens via other mechanisms than drinking water.  The use of the system reduces the number 
of  total  coliform  colonies by  a  factor of 10  and  the number of E.  coli  colonies  by  a  factor  of  20. 
Moreover, if the water presents chlorine residual (indicating safe use of the system), the presence 
of total coliform units is lowered by a factor close to one hundred and the tests show no presence 
of E coli. 

The results show that the project is successful and should be expanded.  However, logistic issues 
need to be resolved.  First, a correct pricing needs to be chosen to ensure the project’s 
sustainability.  Second, the hypochlorite solution has to be easily available in remote regions. 
Third, schools should play a role in the expansion of the project as promoters and educators. 
Lastly, further research is recommended to determine why a health benefit was not seen for 
children under five years old.

III.  WATER RESOURCES – USVI 

According  to  the  United  States  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (USEPA),  the  average 
American  citizen  uses  approximately  150  gallons  (568  Liters)  of water  per  day  (1996).   Of  that 
amount  only  one-half  gallon  is  used  as  drinking  water  while  the  remaining  amount  is  used  for 
cooking, cleaning, flushing, irrigation, or non-consumptive uses.  

Water sources are scarce on the US Virgin Islands due to increased development, poor economic 
conditions,  geology,  and  climate.  Because  of  this, CRABS  has  analyzed  the US Virgin  Islands’ 
water  resources  and  desalination  process  both  from  an  economic  and  environmental  standpoint.  
Based on this analysis, strategies for water reuse, conservation, and watershed management have 
been  developed.  In  addition,  assessments  of  current  desalination  practices  and  processes  to 
maximize efficiency have been completed. 

INTEGRATING WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT - ANALYSIS OF THE 
ST. THOMAS, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS, WATER MARKET 
Water  scarcity  has  been  a  historical  problem  in  the US Virgin  Islands  (USVI). The  combination 
of extreme events such as hurricanes and floods and the lack of holistic planning in infrastructure 
have  conditioned  the  US  Virgin  Islands  population  to  a  state  of  constant  drought.  Because  of 
annual  rainfall  (102  centimeters  (40  inches)  annually  concentrated  between  July  and  November 
(Donahue  and  Johnston,  1998))  and  due  to  low  capture  and  storage  in  the  small  basins  and 
limited aquifers, water conservation is of critical concern for the population and requires constant 
attention  by  the  water  resources  managers  and  planners.  Available  water  supply  comes  from 
three systems: 
•	 Catchments of rainwater with cistern storage, 
•	 Saltwater conversion (desalination), and 
•	 Wells (mainly in St. Croix, because of contamination and different type of geology in 
the St. Thomas main aquifers). 

Due  to  the  high  cost  of water  from  desalination,  the  daily  average  per  capita water  consumption 
is  substantially  less  than  the  US  average,  totaling  190  L/day  per  capita  (OIA,  1999).  Because 
each  island  is  substantially different, analyzing  the  islands as a whole  is difficult.  St. Thomas  is 
the  center  of  tourism  and  commerce,  St.  Croix  is  the  industrial  center,  and  St.  John  is  mainly  a 
natural reserve with low population. 

The  scope  of  this  study  is  focused  on  the  island  of  St.  Thomas.  The  pressure  to  meet  tourism 
demand must be added to the overall local water demand on St. Thomas.  Some authors estimate 
the peak population of  this  island during high  tourism season  to be around 130,000, a figure  that 
almost  triples  the  permanent  population  (Donahue  and  Johnston,  1998).  On  St.  Thomas, 
research has been done in the following areas: 
•	 Available water supply. 
•	 Water demand by water use. 
•	 Evaluation  of  alternative  and  feasible water  supply  options  to  augment  current water 
resources. 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources

•	

Identification of the existing and alternative supplies, with the potential to provide the 
water quantity and quality required for St. Thomas. 
•	 Comparison  of  the  main  potential  supply  strategies  for  St.  Thomas,  taking  in 
consideration economic, environmental, and equity criteria. 
•	 Paths for future development and management of water resources in the island. 

The  stakeholders  in  the  water  market  are  WAPA  (Water  and  Power  Authority),  which  is 
responsible  for generating and  supplying electricity and desalinated water, DPW  (Department of 
Public  Works),  which  is  responsible  for  wastewater  collection,  treatment,  and  disposal,  and 
DPNR (Department of Planning and Natural Resources) which  is responsible for controlling and 
enforcing  potable water  and wastewater  permits,  codes,  and  regulations  through  the Division  of 
Environmental  Protection.  Understanding  the  position  and  interrelation  between  the  major 
stakeholders  regarding  water  resources  is  crucial  for  evaluating  the  particular  dynamics  of  the 
water market.  Representatives of all  these major  stakeholders have been  interviewed  in order  to 
establish a datum during the month of January of 2003. 

WHY INTEGRATING WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT? 
“Integrated  Water  Resources  Management  - IWRM  - is  a  process  which 
promotes  the  coordinated  development  and  management  of  water,  land  and 
related  resources,  in  order  to  maximize  the  resultant  economic  and  social 
welfare  in an equitable manner without compromising  the sustainability of vital 
ecosystems” (Global Water Partnership, 1996). 

To  take  into account  social, natural, and economic conditions  three criteria  should be addressed: 
economic  efficiency  in water  use,  environmental  and  ecological  sustainability,  and  equity  in  the 
access  to  water  for  the  population.  Three  fundamental  complementary  elements  should  be 
encouraged and developed as part of effective water resources management: 
•	 The enabling environment, as a framework. 
•	 The institutional roles at each level and representing every stakeholder. 
•	 The management  and  development  instruments,  as  a  useful  “tool-box”  for  implementing 
IWRM. 

Water  is  a  resource  that has no  frontiers,  and  there  are many neighboring  islands  that  can play  a 
complementary role in water augmentation. 

HISTORIC AND ECONOMIC BACKGROUND FOCUSED ON THE WATER SITUATION 
For a better understanding of  the actual water  situation  in  this U.S.  territory a chronology of key 
events  is  presented.  The  water  situation  is  embedded  in  the  greater  social,  economical,  and 
political  picture  of  the  islands  and  analysis  of  the  water  market  without  taking  into  account  all 
this information is not possible.  It is important to note that institutionally the islands are a young 
autonomous  territory.  Only since 1970, have  the citizens elected  their own governor.  Similar  to 
other institutions in the islands, the ones of the water sector are young. 

In  the  past  fifty  years  the  history  of  water  resources  development  in  the  islands  can  be 
summarized  as  follows.  Until  1960,  hillside  rainfall  catchments  and  dug  wells  composed  the 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources	

24 

major sources of water supply.  Rainwater harvesting was  the source of water for most rural and 
urban  domestic  supplies.  As  proof  of  the  importance  of  this  practice,  in  1964,  the  legislature  of 
the US Virgin  Islands  passed  a  law  that  required  all  new  residential,  commercial,  and  industrial 
buildings  to  have minimum  cistern  storage  proportional  to  roof  surface.    In  1955,  as  population 
started  to  grow,  water  was  barged  from  Puerto  Rico  as  a  supplemental  water  supply.  In  the 
1960’s  and  early  1970’s  population  grew  rapidly  (Figure  4)  as  a  consequence  of  the  shift  in  the 
economic  activity  of  the  island.   During  this  period  the  economy  that was  traditionally  based  in 
agricultural  production,  shifted  to  tourism  and  industry.  This  continuous  growth  in  population 
provoked  an  unprecedented  stress  on  the  available  water  resources.  The  population  rose  from 
32,100 in 1960 to 85,800 in 1975 (USGS, 1987). 

To  mitigate  water  scarcity  the  first  desalination  plant  was  implemented  in  1964.  The  Virgin 
Islands  Water  and  Power  Authority  (VIWAPA)  directed  its  operation.  The  initial  production 
doubled  the  capacity  of  the  existing  supply  system  consisting  of  rainwater  catchments  and 
groundwater extraction (USGS, 1987). 

In  the  1970’s, water  production  by  seawater  conversion  continued  to  expand.  But  at  the  end  of 
that  decade,  due  to  aging  equipment  and  lack  of  maintenance,  a  water  crisis  appeared  again  on 
the islands.  These problems, in addition to periods of drought, over-pumping of wells, failures in 
the distribution systems, and a  lack of adequate storage capacity resulted  in rationing of water  in 
order  to  mitigate  frequent  shortages.    In  1979,  barging  from  Puerto  Rico  started  again  (USGS, 
1987). 

From  1981  to  1982,  the VIWAPA  expanded  its  desalination  capacity  by  2.5 million  gallons  per 
day  (MGD)  on  St.  Thomas  and  by  1.25  MGD  on  St.  Croix,  ending  the  need  for  rationing.  
Although  supplies  were  improved,  water  demands  were  not  fully  satisfied  (USGS,  1987). 
During  the  last  two  decades,  population  growth  has  decreased  and  in  the  last  decade,  negative 
growth  has  been  registered.  Not much  has  been  invested  in  the  expansion  of  the water  system. 
All  the  efforts  made  were  directed  towards  more  efficient  operation  of  the  existing  system.  If 
population  forecasts  from  the  1980’s  (156,000  inhabitants  by  the  year  2000)  materialized,  a 
water  crisis  would  have  been  inevitable  today.    The  fact  that  the  actual  population  is  only 
108,000  (US Bureau of  the Census, 2000) has mitigated  the  failure  to meet  the planned goals  in 
the water resources sector.

WATER SUPPLY ON ST. THOMAS 
CONJUNCTIVE USE OF RAINWATER HARVESTED WATER AND DESALINATED WATER 
General  information  has  been  given  on  the  water  resources  of  the  three  main  islands  that 
compose  the US Virgin  Islands.   A more  thorough  description  of  the water  use  and  perspectives 
for water supply for St. Thomas will be analyzed. 

Many of  the practices described pertaining  to water use  are  common  to  the  three  islands  as well 
as some of their neighboring Caribbean islands. 
“In  most  of  the  smaller  islands  of  the  Caribbean,  there  is  no  single  natural  source  of 
water  that  may  be  used  to  satisfy  the  ever  rising  demand  for  consumption  and  sanitary 
purposes  brought  on  mainly  by  increasing  standards  of  living  and  visitors  arrival. 
Mountainous  terrain  makes  buildable  land  dear,  and  along  with  high  evaporation  rates 
make  larger  surface  water  impoundments  impractical.  Groundwater  supplies  are  limited 
due to high runoff rates and little opportunity for recharge” (Smith, 1987). 

As  of  2003,  the  only  reliable  and  available water  supply  for  all  the  population  in  St.  Thomas  is 
rainfall  water  catchments  (RWC).  Although  desalination  has  been  present  on  the  island  since 
1962,  it  is not distributed  throughout  the  island.  Desalinated seawater  is only allocated  in urban 
areas and  in places where population  is dense.  Groundwater  is used  throughout  the  island but  is 
only  privately  operated.  Because  of  groundwater  contamination,  the  use  of  groundwater  as  a 
water  source  is  considered  a  last  resort.    On  the  other  hand,  many  of  the  resorts  in  the  island 
utilize  privately  owned  reverse  osmosis  systems  (R/O)  to  meet  their  water  needs.  The  actual 
water  use  situation  depends  on  the  location  of  the  resorts  since  public  supply  is  not  available  in 
all areas of the island.  In some cases there total reliance on R/O system for all uses while others 
partially  use  privately  desalinated  water  for  irrigation.  Three  resorts  use  R/O  systems  with  an 
input  of  brackish  ground water,  and  the  remainder  (around  twenty-seven)  use  seawater  as  input 
(Simon, 2003).

As  shown  in  Table  4,  the  allocation  of  water  from  the  public  system  does  not  cover  most 
populated areas, leaving the rest of the population with no other option than to use RWC.  Of the 
permanent  residents  only  forty-five  percent  have  access  to  public  potable  water,  while  sixty 
percent of the population has access to public sewer system.  In an island of these geographic and 
topographic  characteristics,  it  is  far more  costly  to  develop  and maintain  a  sewer  system  than  to 
develop and maintain a water  supply  system,  taking  into account  that desalination plants already 
exist  and  are  in  operation.  Despite  this  fact  and  because  of  economic  considerations, WAPA  is 
not planning to extend its distribution throughout the island. On the other hand, DPW is working 
on extending the sewer system.

WATER DEMAND 
Water  is  allocated  only  for  residential  household  and  community  uses  (schools,  hospitals, 
government),  resorts,  and  commercial  demand.  Water  demands  for  irrigated  agriculture  and  for 
industry  are  negligible  on  the  island.  A  summary  of  the  total  estimated  water  demand  is 
presented in the following table:

SUPPLY AND DEMAND 
Calculations result in the following estimates of supply and demand: 
ESTIMATED AVAILABLE SUPPLY VS. PEAK DEMAND 
Supply = 22,800,000 lpd (6,020,000 gpd)

Demand = 28,000,000 lpd (7,400,000 gpd)

Demand-Supply = 5,20,000 lpd (1,370,000 gpd)  

This value represents the theoretical deficit in available supply during peak demand.


ESTIMATED AVAILABLE SUPPLY VS. LOCAL DEMAND 
This represents the low season on the island.

S = 22,800,000 lpd (6,020,000 gpd)

DNT = 15,800,000 lpd (4,170,000 gpd)

S -DNT = 7,000,000 lpd (1,850,000 gpd)  


This value represents the theoretical available base local supply surplus in tourism low season.  It  

is  clear  from  this  summary  that  in  order  to  provide  for  the  local  water  demand  and  continue

successful  operations  of  the  fundamental  tourism  industry  at  the  same  time,  freshwater

augmentation is a major concern.

EVALUATION  OF  ALTERNATIVE  AND  FEASIBLE  SUPPLY  OPTIONS  THAT  CAN  AUGMENT  THE 
ACTUAL WATER RESOURCES 
The main objective is to discuss the available alternative technologies based on the experience of 
volcanic  islands with  similar  characteristics  as St. Thomas.  The  purpose  of  this  evaluation  is  to 
provide  an  inventory  that  can  be  taken  into  account  by  the  different  actors  to  make  informed 
choices in maximizing the resources of the island.

Some  of  the  technologies  enumerated  in Table  7  have  been  applied  previously  in  the USVI,  the 
rest  of  them  should  be  considered  as  part  of  an  evaluation  of  the  overall  water  resources 
strategies to be discussed between actors of this particular market. 

COMPARISON  OF  THE  THREE  POTENTIAL  STRATEGIES  FOR  FRESHWATER  SUPPLY  AND 
AUGMENTATION 
Of  all  the  sources  of  augmentation  available,  only  distillation,  reverse  osmosis  desalination, and 
submarine piping can provide water  in  the quantity and quality needed on a continuous basis.  In 
an  IWRM  framework,  the  analysis  of  these  options  should  take  into  account  three  different 
elements:  1)  economic  efficiency  in  water  use,  2)  environmental  and  ecological  sustainability, 
and  3)  equity  in  the  access  to  water  for  all  people.  An  evaluation  of  these  three  principles 
follows. 

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE MAIN SUPPLY ALTERNATIVES 
This  analysis  has  been  done,  for  the  purpose  of  fair  comparison,  with  the  operation  data  of 
WAPA for the year 1995.  The cost of alternatives of R/O and submarine piping, were calculated 
for supplying the peak supply of distillation water that WAPA’s plant in Krum Bay, St. Thomas. 
The  alternatives  were  run  for  a  period  of  50  years  of  operation  of  each  of  the  different  supply 
strategies. Detailed calculations are provided by Buscemi (2003).

SUBMARINE PIPING BENEFIT/COST ANALYSIS 
Four different alternatives were run.

First  Alternative:  WAPA  operates  the  pipe  and  fully  finances  the  construction  of  dual  parallel

flexible pipe of 10-inch diameter (2x10”).

Second  Alternative:  WAPA  operates  the  pipe  and  fully  finances  the  construction  of  a  dual

parallel flexible pipe of 8-inch diameter (2x8”).


Third  alternative:  The  water  seller  in  Puerto  Rico,  and/or  possible  users  in  Isla  de  Culebra  and

Vieques  pays  for  half  of  the  cost  of  the  works.  Work  consists  of  a  10-inch  diameter  dual  pipe

alternative.


Fourth  alternative:  The water  seller  in  Puerto Rico,  and/or  possible  users  in  Isla  de Culebra and  

Vieques  pay  for  half  of  the  cost  of  the  works  Work  consists  of  an  8–inch  diameter  dual  pipe 

alternative.


DESALINATION BY DISTILLATION BENEFIT/COST ANALYSIS 
The  actual  data  published  by  WAPA  for  the  year  1995,  was  projected  from  year  1  to  50,  to 
compare it with the other alternatives. 

DESALINATION BY REVERSE OSMOSIS BENEFIT/COST ANALYSIS 
Two different alternatives have been run.  

First Alternative: WAPA operates the RO plants.


Second  Alternative:  A  private  operator  is  contracted  by  WAPA  and  sells  water  produced  at  a

fixed value of $3/m³.

Detailed calculations are provided by Buscemi (2003).


PROJECT COMPARISON 
The  alternatives  developed  are  ranked  according  to  the  PVBREV/PVCOS  ratio,  or  benefit–cost 
ratio  in  Table  8.  As  all  the  alternative  projects  have  a  cost  constraint,  the  benefit-cost  ratio  is  a 
good indicator of the choice of project from a purely economic point of view.  These projects are 
not  considered  as  mutually  exclusive,  because  they  are  part  of  an  augmentation  strategy.  The 
proper combination of different alternatives can be  suitable  for  the objectives of water  resources 
planning.

EQUITY IN THE ACCESS TO WATER FOR ALL PEOPLE 
Regarding  the  distribution  of  the  public  water  system,  it  has  been  noted  that  the  main  problem 
lies  in  the  centralized  distribution  of water.  As  system  expansion  has  not  been  accomplished  as 
planned  in  the  last  two  decades,  55%  of  the  permanent  population  does  not  have  access  to  the 
public  distribution  system.  It  is  also  to  be  highlighted  that,  lack  of  access  to  the  public  system 
does  not  depend,  as  in  many  other  cases,  on  the  income  composition  of  the  population.    This 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources

adds  to  the  challenge  of  extending  the  distribution  in  a  hilly  terrain  of  volcanic  soils,  the 
opportunity of the willingness, and ability to pay of the potential new customers. 

ANSWERS TOWARDS INTEGRATING WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT 
There are several water resources management issues that are crucial for facing the challenges of 
the constrained St. Thomas water market. 

Returning  to  the main  questions  about  the  key  issues  on water  resources management described 
earlier in this section, and after careful analysis of the actual situation it is possible to discuss the 
answers to them. 

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES OF SEPARATE OPERATION OF WATER SUPPLY AND WASTEWATER 
Is  it  desirable  to  have  two  different  entities  operating  water  supply  and  water  disposal?    By 
understanding  that  water  is  a  renewable  and  reusable  resource,  a  recommended  practice  is  to 
integrate  the management and operation of  these  two  services  in order  to ensure  that wastewater 
flows  can  be  an  effective  addition  to  resource  flows  of water  supply.   Although  in  the  case  of  a 
water-limited  economy  as  the  one  under  consideration,  it  does  not  seem  rational  to  operate with 
different  companies  water  supply  and  sewage  collection.  Given  the  extreme  necessity  on 
considering ways of  reusing water,  it will be highly  recommendable  to operate and design water 
supply and wastewater collection and reuse conjunctively.  Today two different agencies with no 
points in common are operating separately these two services, and until now, the government has 
implemented  no  significant water  reuse  policies.  Some  resorts  have  been  applying  the  principle 
of water  reuse  in  the  island  by  recycling  treated water  for  irrigation  uses.  This  is  a  direction  to 
which to point in the near future. 

RELIABILITY OF PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM BASED IN DESALINATION. FREQUENCY OF EXTREME EVENTS 
Is  it  possible  to  operate  a  reliable water  system  based  only  in  one  supply  strategy  (desalination) 
in a place where the occurrence of extreme events is of high frequency? 
After  the analysis of  the water  sector  situation  in  the  island  it  is clear  that desalination, although 
having  played  an  important  role  in  the  island  development  in  the  decade  of  the  sixties  and 
seventies,  could  never  give  a  full  response  to  water  needs  of  the  island.  At  present,  although  a 
valuable and secure supply for freshwater, and after beginning to charge full price from the water 
they are selling, WAPA still faces operational problems, and has to think about future alternative 
technologies  that can be more  suitable  to  the St. Thomas needs. Careful consideration  should be 
given to the alternatives that have been developed in this work. 
It is possible to apply more cost-effective alternatives as the main supply strategy to the island. It 
has been proven in this work that importing water from Puerto Rico through submarine pipelines 
is a feasible alternative. Moreover, in the long term it will allow WAPA to focus in the extension 
of the system. 

On  the  other  hand,  private  resorts  have  been  successful  in  incorporating  R/O  plants with  up-to-
date  technologies.  In  addition,  they  are  reporting  huge  savings  over  water  bought  from WAPA. 
Two  years  ago  an  attempt  to  privatize  part  of WAPA  as  a  concession  failed.  The  legislature  of 
the Virgin  Islands  did  not  approve  the  arrangement  between WAPA  and Southern Waters.   Still 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources 

32 

today,  all  the  major  services  are  in  government  hands  and  although  improvements  have  been 
made  in  the water  sector,  privatization  can  be  a  possibility  that  ought  to  be  analyzed  in  the  near 
future.  All the facilities operated by resorts and other private owners report better yields than the 
government-owned WAPA. 

It  is  also  important  to  note  that  the  actual  institutions  have  been  going  through  great  changes  in 
the  last  three  decades.    In  1971,  the  first  elected  governor  assumed  office  in  the  islands,  before 
that  the  U.S.  federal  government  designated  the  governor. 
Institutions  are  not  yet  mature, 
although they have many of the requirements that the continental states have, but lack the proper 
solid institutional background needed for the task.  That is why enforcement of EPA regulations, 
for instance, is slow and has fewer results than expected. 

WATER COSTS AND PRICES IN THIS MARKET 
How can proper prices on water be managed  in a market with  these characteristics?   The  idea of 
equitable prices has been undergoing drastic changes in the last decade.  Full pricing of water has 
become  a  necessity  because  of  the  large  debt  that  the  VI  government  has  contracted  with  the 
federal  government.    But  there  are  some  gray  areas  that  need  to  be  defined  and  clarified.  For 
instance  the  housing  projects  managed  by  VIHA  (Virgin  Island  Housing  Authority)  as  well  as 
other territorial government agencies remain the main clients of WAPA and rarely pay their bills.  
This sort of cross-subsidy should be corrected, but it seems to be a long road yet to be taken. 

HEALTH  CONSEQUENCES  AND  WATER  QUALITY: RAINFALL  HARVESTING  AS  MAIN  SOURCE  OF  WATER 
SUPPLY 
How  can  overall water  quality  be  assured when  catchments  of  rainfall  is  the main water  supply 
for more  than  70%  of  the  population?  Water  quality  for  human  consumption  is  still  an  issue  to 
be solved in the islands. Because 70% of the population relies on water catchments for their daily 
water consumption, a strict control of water quality should be  implemented  in households.   This 
task  can  be  done  by  DPNR  and  the  Department  of  Public  Health.  Public  campaigns  for 
instructing  the  population  on  a  regular  basis  are  sporadic  and  only  applied when  an  outbreak  of 
waterborne  disease  appears  on  the  horizon.  No  up-to-date  studies  founded  on  statistical  data 
have examined waterborne diseases linked with the exposure of the majority of the population to 
water related health risks.

ASSESSMENT 

ISLANDS  DESALINATION  SUSTAINABILITY 

It  has  traditionally  been  thought  that  the  cost  per  unit  volume  of  potable  water  supplied  by  a 
desalination  plant  is  much  greater  than  from  other  traditional  drinking  water  treatment.  While 
that  statement  has  historically  been  true,  the  gap  in  costs  between  desalination  and  traditional 
water  sources  per  unit  volume  of  potable  water  is  narrowing  rapidly  (Angelo,  2000;  Kufahl, 
2002). 

This narrowing is largely due to improvements and research in desalination technology that have 
drastically  driven  down  costs.  Main  factors  have  been  improvements  in  the  reverse  osmosis 
process (Fong, 2001).  Increases in the costs of drinking water from traditional sources caused by 
increased  treatment  standards  and  requirements  as  well  as  ever-increasing  water  shortages  also 
support this narrowing trend (Kufahl, 2002; Tsiourtis, 2001). 

Although  many  different  types  of  desalination  plants  exist,  the  two  most  prevalent  desalination 
systems  are  distillation  and  reverse  osmosis  (Hanson  et  al.,  2002).    Three  types  of  distillation 
processes  exist:  multi-state  flash,  multi-effect  flash,  and  vapor  compression.    Distillation 
typically  involves  a  series  of  these  heating/condensing  stages,  each  of  which  is  performed  at 
lower  pressures  using  recycled  heat  and water  from  the  last  stage  to  increase  overall  efficiency. 
The  process  simply  heats  water  and  lowers  the  ambient  air  pressure  until  water  “flashes”  into 
vapor phase which is then condensed so that it can be collected, treated if necessary, and used for 
drinking.  In  reverse  osmosis  the water  that  is  to  be  treated  is  pumped  at  high  pressures,  against 
the  natural  osmotic  gradient,  through  a  semi-permeable  membrane  that  allows  smaller  water 
molecules  to  pass  through  but  not  larger  salt  ions.  Water  that  goes  through  the  reverse  osmosis 
process  is  pretreated  to  remove  contaminants  that  would  clog  the  membranes  and  reduce 
efficiency.  Typically, one membrane will treat water to recommended standards, but two may be 
used to improve water quality. 

SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT OF THE DESALINATION INDUSTRY 
INTRODUCTION 
The  concept  of  a  sustainability  assessment  stems  from  the  emerging  concept  in  the 
environmental  field  of  sustainable  development.  Sustainable  development  can  be  defined  as 
“development  that  meets  the  needs  of  the  present  without  compromising  the  ability  of  future 
generations  to  meet  their  own  needs”  (IISD,  2002).  Sustainability  assessments  are  empirical 
methods used  to quantify and assess how well a particular project, area, or  industry meets needs 
of the current generation while maintaining the ability of future generations to meet their needs. 

Numerous  studies have been conducted  to evaluate  the  relative advantages and disadvantages of 
each  desalination  treatment  process  (Al-Mataz,  1996;  Darwish  and  Jawad,  1989;  Kamal,  1995; 
Madani,  1990).  Very  few  studies  have  been  conducted  to  examine  the  complex  interactions  of 
sustainability  indicators;  none  have  incorporated  social,  economical,  and  environmental  factors 
into the study.  An evenly weighted numerical scoring system will be used in order to assure that

each  indicator  will  equally  affect  the  assessment’s  results.  This  scoring  system  produces  clear 
and interpretable results that can easily be relayed to stakeholders. 
SCOPE 
The  scope  of  this  study  focuses  entirely  on  desalination  treatment  processes.   The  sustainability 
assessment  aims  to  determine  whether  trends  in  the  processes  currently  used  are  more 
sustainable  than  previous  processes.  Specifically,  this  study  attempts  to  determine  if  the 
industry’s  shift  from  distillation  desalination  techniques  to  reverse  osmosis  desalination 
techniques has moved the industry towards sustainable operation. 

No  consideration  will  be  given  to  factors  outside  of  actual  treatment  processes  performance. 
This approach allows  for a narrowly  focused  study where  reliable data can be  found and applied 
to the entire industry from an engineering perspective. 

Desalination  plants  in  operation  on  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands  are  used  in  the  study.  Specifically, 
the Water  and  Power  Authority  Plants  on  both  St.  Thomas  and  St.  John,  as  well  as  an  old  and 
new plant in operation at Caneel Bay, operated by Aqua Design, are used.  These plants are used 
to  represent  the  desalination  industry worldwide.  The  plants  located  on  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands 
can be considered as a representative sample of plants worldwide for many reasons. 

•	 There are many desalination plants located on the islands that can be analyzed, providing 
a large set of consistent, reliable data. 
•	 The data are reliable and easy to obtain.  
•	 Desalination plants on the islands range from very large to very small. 
•	 The  islands’ desalination facilities, along with  those  in  the Middle East, have become  the 
standard for desalination research. 

Because  of  their  long,  well-recorded  history  and  operational  performance,  as  well  as  the  other 
factors  outlined  above,  desalination  plants  on  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands  are  very  well  suited  for  a 
sustainability  assessment  aimed  at  determining  a  trend  toward  or  away  from  sustainable 
operation of the desalination treatment process. 
SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS 
The  sustainability  indicators  chosen  for  the  sustainability  assessment  represent  essential  factors 
related  to  the  desalination  treatment  process.  The  indicators  were  also  chosen  based  on  their 
relative  importance  to  the  desalination  industry.  To  examine  only  the  treatment  process  it  is 
important  that  the  sustainability  indicators  are  only  affected  if  factors  related  to  the  treatment 
process change. 

The chosen sustainability indicators are as follows. 

•	 Cost required to produce 1000 gallons of potable water 
•	 Fuel required to produce 1000 gallons of potable water 
•	 Effluent brine water temperature 
•	 Effluent brine maximum and minimum pH 
•	 Effluent brine flow rates per amount of potable water produced

The most important factors that can vary between the plants in the study that would change these 
indicators  and  that  are  a  part  of  the  treatment  process  are  size  of  plant;  type  and  cost  of 
desalination process in operation; and energy required by the chosen desalination process. 

PLANT DESCRIPTIONS 
The  sustainability  assessment  focuses  on  the  desalination  plants  operated  by  either  the  U.S. 
Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority or by Aqua Design Incorporated.  The plants operated 
by  the  U.S.V.I.  Water  and  Power  Authority  represent  older  distillation  processes.    The  plants 
operated  by  Aqua  Design  at  Caneel  Bay  represent  both  older  and  newer  reverse  osmosis 
technology.

METHODS 
To  assess  whether  or  not  the  desalination  treatment  process  is  moving  towards  sustainable 
operation,  each  desalination  plant  is  compared  to  the  others  through  the  use  of  the  five  chosen 
sustainability indicators.  For the Water and Power Authority Plants, data were obtained from the 
December 2002 and July 1998 operating months.  For the Caneel Bay plants, data were obtained 
from  the  January  2003  operating  month  from  Aqua  Design  district  supervisor  Ron  Di  Cola. 
Each plant was then compared to all of the other plants for each indicator.

After  the  raw  data  were  obtained,  the  data  were  converted  to  consistent  units  and  compiled. 
Charts  were  created  for  each  sustainability  indicator  for  analysis.  Then  sustainability  scores 
from  one  to  four,  four  being  the  most  favorable  condition  for  that  indicator,  were  assigned  to 
each  plant  for  each  indicator.  These  scores were  then  summed  for  two  different  assessments  to 
obtain  a  sustainability  score.  The  first  assessment  (SS  #1)  used  all  five  indicators  while  the 
second assessment (SS #2) used only the fuel and cost indicators.  
RESULTS 
To  more  effectively  display  the  results,  each  desalination  plant  was  assigned  a  number.  These 
are shown in Table 11. 

The results for each sustainability indicator are shown in Table 12.

sustainability.

RESULTS OF SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT #2 

DISCUSSION 
The  results  above  show  that  the  desalination  treatment  process  is  moving  towards  sustainable 
operation.  The  new  reverse  osmosis  plant  in  Caneel  Bay  scores  higher  than  either  of  the  two 
older distillation plants  in both  sustainability assessments.  In addition,  the older plant  in Caneel 
Bay  scored  higher  than  the  better  of  the  two  distillation  plants,  St.  Thomas,  in  the  first 
sustainability  assessment  and  had  the  same  score  in  the  second  assessment.    These  results 
indicate  that  the  worst-case  scenario  for  reverse  osmosis,  the  older  plant  at  Caneel  Bay,  is  at 
worst  operating  at  the  same  sustainability  level  as  the  best-case  scenario  for  distillation

processes.  The  results  also  show  that  the  best-case  scenario  for  distillation  operates  at  a 
significantly  lower  sustainability  level  than  the  new  Caneel  Bay  plant,  which  represents  a 
middle-of-the-road reverse osmosis scenario.  

The new Caneel Bay  treatment process operates at a more  sustainable  level  than  the other plants 
because  it  incorporates  the  newest  research  and  technological  advancements  made  in  the 
desalination  treatment  process.  These  advancements  allow  the  process  to  use  less  fuel  and 
decrease operational costs. 

The  old  Caneel  Bay  treatment  process  and  the  St.  Thomas  treatment  process  operate  at  a  lower 
level of  sustainability.  The old Caneel Bay process has  low operational costs  similar  to  the new 
Caneel  Bay  plant  but  requires  a  greater  amount  of  fuel.  The  St.  Thomas  process  has  high 
operational costs compared to the new Caneel Bay plant and requires about same amount of fuel. 
The  St.  Thomas  process  has  a  higher  operational  cost  than  the  new Caneel Bay  plant  because  it 
operates  at  higher  pressures  and  because  the multi-effect  distillation  process,  like  all  distillation 
processes, is less efficient than the reverse osmosis process and can not produce as much potable 
water  per  unit  of  energy  added  to  the  process.  The  larger  process  creates  economies  of  scale  to 
create  this  effect  but  the  larger  size  also  increases  system  inefficiencies  which  increase  overall 
operational costs. 

The  St.  John  plant,  which  represents  the  worst-case  scenario  for  distillation  treatment  methods, 
operates  on  the  least  sustainable  level.  This  result  is  consistent  with  expectations  because  the 
plant’s  treatment  process  costs  the  most  to  operate  and  consumes  the  most  fuel.  Process 
inefficiencies  cause  the  treatment  process  to  use  significantly  more  energy  than  would  be 
required by other distillation  techniques.    In  addition,  high  operating  pressures  and  temperatures 
significantly increase energy requirements and thus increase operational cost. 

The  first  sustainability  assessment,  in  which  all  five  indicators  are  used,  is  the  most 
comprehensive  model,  but  the  second  sustainability  assessment  model  is  a  more  discriminating 
model.  Scoring  the  environmental  indicators  produced  very  similar  results  for  all  four  plants. 
Because of  this, determining values for each plant based on  the ranking system was difficult and 
subject  to ranking bias.  To negate  this effect,  the second sustainability assessment only factored 
into  the model  those  indicators,  cost  and  fuel,  that  had  clear  divisions  in  values  between  plants. 
Neither of the reverse osmosis plants scored less than the best value of four in any environmental 
indicator’s  sustainability  scoring.  Thus,  it  could  be  argued  that  reverse  osmosis  treatment 
processes  produce  less  environmentally  harmful  effects.  The  data  used  in  this  assessment were 
too  inconclusive  to make  such  a  claim.    It  is  difficult  to  be  certain  that  the  elevated  temperature 
at the St. Thomas plant or the increased effluent flow at the St. John plant causes more harm than 
the levels measured at the other three plants. 

The  fuel  and  cost  indicators  produced  the  most  significant,  interpretable  results  while  the  three 
environmental  indicators  produced  inconclusive  results.  All  four  plants  are  subject  to  this  Act 
and are regulated to the same levels of effluent emissions.  None of the four plants seems to have 
made  any  attempt  to  reduce  these  emissions  to  any  point  below  the  regulated  level  because  of  a 
lack of economic incentives.

Weaknesses in the sustainability assessment are associated with the data used and the linearity of 
the  ranking  system.    The  model  relies  on  raw  data  that  were  obtained  from  a  wide  variety  of 
sources.  Operators  and  plant  officials  provided  cost  data  that  could  have  been  intentionally  or 
unintentionally  misrepresented.  The  model  also  relied  on  an  evenly  weighted  linear  ranking 
system.  This  system  appropriated  even  weight  to  each  indicator,  which  may  not  be  the  best 
approach  because  one  indicator  may  be  more  important  to  the  assessment.  Also,  the  ranking 
system could have been subject to bias as a result of how the ranking values were assigned.    

To  improve  the model,  adjustments  in how  the data were obtained  and  analyzed  could be made. 
The data could be obtained from documented data, which was not available for  this study, rather 
than  personal  interviews.    This  would  provide  the  model  with  solid,  documented  data  that  are 
more convincing than abstract data collected from interviews.

ST.  JOHN  DESALINATION  PLANT  RENEWABLE  ENERGY 
UTILIZATION ASSESSMENT 

Although  it  is a  relatively energy  intensive process, desalinating water  is and will continue  to be 
a  necessary  source  of  potable water.  Currently  desalination  is  heavily  dependant  on  fossil  fuels 
to meet  its energy  requirements.  However,  fossil  fuel use  for desalination  is not sustainable and 
may  not  be  necessary.   One method  of  increasing  existing  desalination  processes  is  through  the 
use  of  renewable  energy.  Specific  proposals  were  therefore  examined  for  increasing  the 
sustainability  of  desalination  for  the  existing  mechanical  vapor  compression  plant  on  St.  John, 
USVI.  These include proposals for use of solar thermal, photovoltaic, and wind energy. 

BACKGROUND 
Sustainability  is  commonly  defined  as  meeting,  “Meeting  the  needs  of  the  present  without 
compromising  the  ability  of  future  generations  to  meet  their  needs  (WCED,  1987).”    Although 
progress  towards  sustainability  is helpful,  true  sustainability would  require maintaining  constant 
equilibrium, or a net gain, with the earth’s resources.  For example, using energy only at the rate, 
or  more  slowly,  at  which  it  can  be  provided  by  the  environment.    By  definition,  renewable 
energy meets this goal. 

Unlike  fossil  fuels,  renewable  energy  is  constantly  being  replenished.  The  use  of  renewable 
energy  not  only  lessens,  or  even  eliminates,  the  unsustainable  use  of  fossil  fuels,  but  also  the 
pollutants  they  produce.  These  pollutants  include  sulfur  dioxide,  particulates,  and  an  annual 
global  discharge  of  over  20  billion  tons  of  greenhouse  gas  carbon  dioxide  (Cassedy,  2000). 
Pocesses  for  the  production  of  renewable  energy  are  continuously  increasing  and  more 
economical with  the  vast majority  of  renewable  energy  sources  having  their  basis  from  the  sun. 
These solar sources include direct solar power from photovoltaics or solar thermal energy as well 
as power derived from wind, biomass, and ocean thermal sources.  

Since desalination is a particularly energy intensive process and globally the vast majority of this 
energy  is  derived  from  fossil  fuels,  there  is  great  room  for  improvement  in  desalination 
sustainability.   Most  efforts which  increase  desalination  sustainability  currently  consist  of  using 
direct thermal energy for distillation.  Due to the high energy requirement for desalinating water, 
it is often economically beneficial to site distillation desalination plants with cogeneration power 
plants.  By  this  pairing,  not  only  is  it  possible  to  avoid  any  significant  electricity  transmission 
losses,  but  waste  heat  produced  by  the  cogeneration  plant  can  be  used  to  heat  influent  water. 
However,  only  thermal  distillation  processes  can  make  use  of  heat  in  desalting  water.    Other 
methods  are  limited  to  the  use  of  higher  grades  of  energy, mechanical  or  electrical.  The Water 
and  Power  Authority  (WAPA)  desalination  plant  on  St.  John  is  one  such  plant  which  requires 
one of these higher grades of energy.

ST. JOHN, USVI PAST AND PRESENT 
DESALINATION 
The  public water  utility  provider,  the Water  and Power Authority  (WAPA),  currently  operates  a 
155,000  gallon/day-maximum  capacity mechanical  vapor  compression  desalination  plant  on  the 
island of St.  John.  This plant  supplies piped water  to  the  city of Cruz Bay  and  trucked water  as 
needed  to  the  rest  of  the  island.  During  the  winter  months  of  the  tourist  season  and  during 
Carnival  (late  June/early  July),  demand  exceeds  the  supply  capacity  of  this  plant.    Therefore, 
WAPA  is  also  subcontracting  a  reverse osmosis plant of  equal  size  to meet  the  remainder of  the 
water  demand  until  construction  of  a  potable  water  pipeline  from  St.  Thomas  is  completed  in 
2004  (Rothgeb,  2003)  or  until  desalination  capacity  can  be  permanently  expanded  on  St.  John 
(Chung, 2003).

ENERGY 
There is a 2.5 MW diesel power plant in proximity to the St. John desalination facility, but due to 
the  expense  of  operating  it,  the  entire  island  power  demand  of  up  to  11  MW  at  average  peak 
times  and  15  MW  during  Carnival  (late  June/early  July)  is  imported  from  St.  Thomas  (Chung, 
2003).  There  are,  however,  significant  issues  concerning  the  reliability  of  electricity  imported 
from  St.  Thomas.  Outages  and  surges  are  fairly  common  for  St.  John,  occurring  at  least  every 
two weeks  and  sometimes multiple  times  in  one  day  (Hendrickson,  2003).  Although  this  is  not 
as  damaging  to mechanical  vapor  compression  equipment  as  it would  be  for  reverse  osmosis,  it 
still  sometimes  requires  over  an  hour  to  start  equipment  back  up  after  having  been  down.  All 
together,  the  island  of  St.  John  experiences  approximately  100  hours/year  of  outages  (USDOE, 
2001).  In  addition,  electricity  production  on  St.  Thomas  comes  almost  entirely  from  number  2 
and  6  fuel  oils.  As  the  USVI  has  no  petroleum  resource  of  its  own,  the  cost  of  importing  fuel 
makes  electricity  very  expensive.  The  current  cost  of  electricity  production  is  $0.09/kWh, 
excluding  distribution  losses  and  administrative  costs,  with  retail  rates  at  approximately 
$0.14/kWh  for  large  commercial  customers  and  $0.17/kWh  for  residential  customers  (Rothgeb, 
2003).  Distributed  renewable  energy  would  not  only  move  the WAPA  desalination  facility  on 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources 

43 

St.  John  toward  sustainability,  but  could  also  provide  the  benefit  of  increased  reliability  and 
reduced cost. 

ST. JOHN RENEWABLE ENERGY ANALYSIS 
In  an  effort  to  move  St.  John  desalination  towards  sustainability  and  increase  the  reliability  of 
energy  resources,  three  renewable  energy  sources  were  analyzed.    Analysis  was  made  of  the 
potential  for  solar  thermal,  photovoltaic,  and  wind  energies  to  be  paired  with  the  existing 
mechanical  vapor  compression  distillation  plant  on  St.  John.  Solar  thermal  energy  through  use 
of solar ponds has the advantage of being relatively low cost and having energy storage capacity.  
Photovoltaic  and  wind  energy,  on  the  other  hand,  have  no  inherent  storage  capacity,  but  are 
considered  particularly  well  suited  to  use  with  mechanical  vapor  compression  (Delyannis  and 
Belessiotis,  1995).  All  systems  were  designed  to  be  grid-connected  and  do  not  use  batteries 
since batteries are problematic, particularly in warm climates.  Plant data indicate that in the time 
from July 1998 to December 2002, WAPA’s fuel costs increased from $15.56/bbl and $15.37/bbl 
for  numbers  6  and  2  fuel  oil  respectively  to  $29.52/bbl  and  $29.18/bbl.  Therefore  benefits  are 
based  on  about  half  this  rate  of  increase  and  a  cost  of  $0.09/kWh  to  produce  electricity.  Costs 
assume 3 percent  inflation.  And present value analysis is based on WAPA’s current loan rate of 
5.25 percent (Rothgeb, 2003).

SOLAR POND 
Solar ponds are a type of thermal solar technology where thermal energy is stored at the bed of a 
pond  by  suppression  of  convection  by  a  salinity  density  gradient.    An  analysis  of  the  potential 
for  use  of  solar  pond  technology  found  that,  economically,  this  is  a  fairly  beneficial  project 
(Table 14).  As  the  local utility  is hesitant about using unproven  technologies, another benefit of 
this  project  is  that  it  is well  established.   Although,  solar ponds  are not  common  in  the US,  they 
have  been  used  widely  in  Israel  for  over  40  years.  The  greatest  advantages,  however,  are  its 
storage capacity and reliability for consistent energy output.  This is particularly important as the 
desalination  facility  operates  24  hr/day.  Literature  recommends  that  solar  ponds  be  designed  to 
meet  average  annual  energy  requirements.  As  such,  although  average  energy  needs  can  be met 
by  a  solar  pond,  additional  energy  will  be  needed  from  grid-supplied  energy  though  the  pond 
would  be  able  to  sustain  the  desalination  process  during  power  outages.  A  disadvantage  of  a 
solar  pond,  however,  is  that  it  is  an  extremely  diffuse  resource.  Therefore,  approximately  19.5 
acres of  land would be  required  for  the 18 acre  solar pond  to meet a design capacity of 254 kW. 
Also,  as  long  as  5 months  can  be  expected  for  establishing  a  high  enough  LCZ  temperature  for 
energy use.  As a result, no cost savings is expected in the first 6-8 months of the project.  

PHOTOVOLTAICS 
As  seen  in  Table  14,  supplying  power  to  desalination  by  photovoltaics  is  not  financially 
beneficial,  although  only  marginally  so.  The  main  reason  for  this  is  that  photovoltaics  exhibit 
minimal  economies  of  scale.  Where  rebates  are  available,  though,  small  photovoltaic  systems 
(since rebate programs tend to have a ceiling payment) are particularly beneficial in areas of high 
solar  insolation.  Although  St.  John  has  significant  insolation,  the  project  is  not  economically 
feasible.    Furthermore,  since  no  batteries  were  factored  into  the  design,  photovoltaic  energy 
would not be available  for 24-hour plant operation.   Therefore, at  least half of  the energy  in  this 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources 

44 

situation would need to come from grid-supplied electricity.  In addition, approximately 1 acre of 
land would be required for this project. 

WIND 
As indicated in Table 14, wind energy is the most economically beneficial project for moving St. 
John’s  vapor  compression  desalination  toward  sustainability.  In  this  design,  a  900  kW  wind 
turbine  is  proposed.  Although wind  speed will  depend  to  a  great  extent  on  the  turbine  location, 
class 3 areas are present  in  the  immediate vicinity of  the desalination plant.  St.  John  is a  former 
volcanic  island  and,  as  a  result,  is  quite  hilly.   Nearby  ridge-tops  are  classified  as  class  3, while 
only  class  1  winds  exist  along  the  coast.  Although  there  is  no  inherent  storage  capacity  with 
wind energy, wind  is available  throughout  the day and so storage  is not necessarily needed.  It  is 
expected  that  some  grid  energy  will  be  required.    Wind  energy  also  has  the  benefit  of  not 
requiring  significant  expanses  of  land.  It  is  expected  that  proposed  turbine  could  be  located  on 
existing WAPA property.  For  this project, 2002 wind speed data were used  to  estimate both  the 
electricity  savings  for desalination  and  the  amount  saved by  supplying  excess  electricity back  to 
the grid.

Despite St. John’s significant solar resources and only fair wind resources, wind energy has been 
found  the most  promising  renewable  energy  to move  St.  John’s  vapor  compression  desalination 
plant  toward  sustainability.  Not  only  is  the  proposed wind  energy  design  able  to meet  a  greater 
proportion  of  the  energy  needs  of  desalination,  but  it  also  has  a  relatively  low  land  area 
requirement,  compared  to  solar  thermal  and  even  photovoltaics,  and  is  available  throughout  the 
day  for 24 hour/day desalination plant operation.  Furthermore, as  it  is a well established energy 
source,  used  in  small  scale  by  others  on  the  islands,  it  is  likely  to  be  well  accepted  by  WAPA 
officials as well.

WATER REUSE AND CONSERVATION 
WATER REUSE OVERVIEW 
The  initial  guidelines  developed  in  1980  by  the  USEPA  included  information  on  proven 
technologies  in  the  area  of  water  reuse  (Ammerman  and  McCullen,  2002).  In  1992,  through 
funding  from  the  USEPA  and  the  US  Agency  for  International  Development’s  (USAID) Water 
and  Sanitation  for  Health  (WASH)  program,  these  guidelines  were  updated  to  reflect 
technological  advances  in  water  reuse  practices.  In  2002,  the  USEPA  decided  to  update  the 
water  reuse  guidelines  due  to  significant  technological  advancements  since  the  last  update  in 
1992.  These updates are planned to be completed and published by the USEPA in 2004. 

As was described in the proposal dated December 9, 2002, various types of reuse projects can be 
applied  in a community.  All of  the  reuse categories described  in  the proposal were evaluated as 
possible reuse, conservation, and disposal alternatives for St. Thomas and St. Croix. 
WATER CONSERVATION OVERVIEW 
The USEPA has published guidelines regarding conservation practices that can be undertaken by 
all  water  users  and  suggests  changing  a  few  personal  habits  to  effectively  conserve  water 
(USEPA,  2002c).  In  the  home,  the most water  is  used  in  the  bathroom.  Turning  off  the  faucet 
while  brushing  teeth  and  taking  a  three  to  five  minute  shower  instead  of  a  bath  can  conserve 
approximately  35  gallons  of  water  per  day.  Flushing  the  toilet  also  uses  a  large  percentage  of 
water.  Installing  products  from water  conservation  equipment  vendors  helps  to  conserve water. 
Operators  of  residential  and  commercial  irrigation  systems  can  also  conserve  water  by 
implementing the more efficient Xeriscaping concept (USEPA, 2000b). 

USVI WATER REUSE AND CONSERVATION SURVEY AND INTERVIEW RESULTS 
In  order  to  assess  the  current  water  reuse  and  conservation  practices  in  the  US  Virgin  Islands, 
surveys  were  distributed  and  interviews  were  conducted  with  facility  managers.    Of  the  79 
potential  survey  participants  identified  as  TPDES  permit  holders,  68  surveys  were  mailed  to 
businesses  in  the  Virgin  Islands  since  address  information  was  not  available  for  11  businesses. 
Fifty-four of those surveys were presumed to have reached the intended business or municipality 
and  ten  completed  surveys  were  returned.  Nine  out  of  ten  of  the  surveys  completed  showed 
reuse  programs  consisting  of  irrigation;  only  one  facility  discharged  their  treated wastewater  via 
an  ocean  outfall.    Six  of  these  ten  facilities  use  primary  treatment  with  chlorine  disinfection, 
three  utilize  secondary  treatment  with  chlorine  disinfection,  and  one  sends  wastewater  to  the 
local  municipal  plant  for  treatment.  Five  of  the  ten  surveys  indicated  conservation  practices 
were  in  place.  Notices  indicating  the  importance  of  conserving  water  are  posted  at  three 
facilities,  1.6-gallon  toilets  were  installed  at  two  facilities,  and  2.5-gallon  per  minute 
showerheads were installed in each of the 290 rooms of a local resort.  

Of the ten facilities that completed and returned the survey discussed in the previous section, the 
managers  of  six  agreed  to  be  interviewed.  Many  businesses  in  the  US  Virgin  Islands  have 
implemented  various  levels  of  water  reuse  and  conservation  practices  in  order  to  decrease 
operating  cost  and  the  amount  of  potable water  needed  and  to  avoid  filing  a wastewater  permit. 
The information gained from the six interviews is summarized in the following paragraphs. 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources 

46 

INTERVIEW 1: BEST WESTERN EMERALD BEACH RESORT 
The  Best Western  Emerald  Beach  Resort  is  located  in  Lindbergh  Bay  in  St.  Thomas.  This  90­
room  resort  averages  between  60  and  80  percent  occupancy  throughout  the  year  and  uses 
between 14,000 and 17,000 gallons per day (gpd) of water.  Since 1999, a reverse osmosis (R/O) 
desalination  plant  is  permitted  under  the  TPDES  program  and  treats  water  extracted  from  a 
brackish well  located on  the resort’s property.  When demand exceeds output of  the desalination 
plant,  supplemental  water  is  purchased  from  the  Virgin  Islands  Water  and  Power  Authority 
(WAPA).  The brine discharge  from  the R/O process  is  sent  to an on-site 100,000-gallon cistern 
to be utilized for irrigation and toilet flushing. 

The  Emerald  Beach  Resort  sends  wastewater  to  the  municipal  treatment  plant  located  at  the 
airport.  At  the  time  of  this  interview,  all  wastewater  flows  to  the  airport  treatment  plant  were 
being  sent  without  treatment  to  an  ocean  outfall  until  upgrades  to  the  treatment  plant  are 
completed.  Conservation  practices  at  the  hotel were  few.    In  each  room  a  card  is  present  on  the 
wall  that  gives  hotel  guests  the  choice  of  having  their  towels  and  bedding  washed  and  changed 
every day.  Beyond this there are no other conservation practices in place.  Unfortunately, when I 
stayed  at  the  hotel,  staff  disregarded  the  card  in  my  room  and  changed  the  bedding  and  towels 
even  though  I  had  chosen  the water  conservation  option.  Thus,  currently,  no  reuse  and minimal 
conservation measures are utilized at this hotel. 

In  order  to  decrease  operating  costs,  the manager  of  the Emerald Beach Resort  and Carib Beach 
Resort asked CRABS to determine if a well of sufficient yields could be drilled on the site of the 
Carib  Beach  Resort.  By  looking  at  USGS  maps  showing  the  geological  makeup  of  the  area  in 
question  as  well  as  performing  a  site  walk-through,  a  well  would  result  in  low  yields  (5  to  10 
gpm) due to the igneous rock formation on which the Carib Resort is built. 
INTERVIEW 2: ANCHORAGE CONDOMINIUMS 
Located in Cowpet Bay the east end the island of St. Thomas, this condominium complex has 50 
2-bedroom units and 25 3-bedroom units.  On average, the complex is 35% occupied mid-May to 
mid-November  (off-peak  season)  and  70%  occupied mid-November  to mid-May  (peak  season). 
This causes water usage to increase from an average of 4,000 to 8,000 gpd and wastewater flows 
to increase from 4,000 to as much as 10,000 gpd.  Currently, WAPA drinking water service lines 
do  not  extend  to  this  complex.  Therefore,  desalination  is  used  for  drinking  water  production 
since  rainwater  cisterns  cannot meet  the  demand  of  the  residents.  This  complex  is  permitted  to 
utilize  R/O  technology,  but  unlike  the  Emerald  Beach  Resort  this  facility  treats  seawater 
withdrawn  from  an  intake  located  in  Cowpet  Bay  and  discharges  waste  brine  into  the  ocean. 
Rainwater is collected and utilized to backwash the filter used after withdrawal from the bay. 

Built  in  1978,  the  on-site  wastewater  facility  utilizes  a  primary  clarifier  with  extended  aeration, 
chlorine  tablets  for  disinfection,  and  a  sand  filter.    Treated  wastewater  effluent  is  sent  to  a 
25,000-gallon  cistern  prior  to  being  reused  as  irrigation  supply.    If  irrigation  cannot  be  carried 
out  each  night  the  cistern  has  capacity  for  approximately  two  and  a  half  days  of  average  flow.  
According  to  the  manager,  the  complex  does  not  have  a  permit  for  an  ocean  discharge. 
Therefore, discharge through the irrigation system is the only option.  Since no samples of either 
the  raw  influent  or  treated  effluent  are  analyzed  by  a  laboratory,  there  is  no  indication  of 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources 

47 

treatment efficiency.  In addition  to reuse practices, water conservation such as 1.6-gallon toilets 
were installed in each of the condominium units. 
INTERVIEW 3: SAPPHIRE VILLAGE CONDOMINIUMS 
Overlooking St. John Bay on St. Thomas, this condominium complex has 135 studio apartments 
and  90  one-bedroom  apartments,  which  are  occupied  by  70  permanent  and  approximately  145 
temporary  residents.  Utilizing  R/O  technology  due  to  lack  of  WAPA  service  in  the  area,  the 
facility  is  permitted  to  treat  and  deliver  an  average  of  8,000  gpd  during  peak  season  and  5,000 
gpd during off-peak season. 

The wastewater  treatment  facility  is approximately 20 years old and currently utilizes  secondary 
treatment  processes  without  first  going  through  primary  treatment.    After  passing  through 
secondary treatment, the wastewater is disinfected using chlorine tablets.  Treated effluent is then 
stored  in  a  27,000-gallon  cistern  and  used  for  irrigation.    Because  of  the  inefficient  treatment 
scheme  and  clogging  of  sprinkler  heads,  the  manager  is  working  on  improving  the  treatment 
process with the addition of minimal infrastructure. 

A  24,000-gallon  cistern  is  located  underneath  one  of  the  condominium  units.    This  L-shaped 
cistern  is  currently  not  being  utilized  and would  be  a  convenient  place  for  the  raw  sewage  from 
the  complex  to  collect  and  settle  before  being  pumped  up  to  the  current  secondary  treatment 
tank.  My  recommendation  is  to  utilize  the  24,000  gallon  cistern  tank  as  a  primary  settling  tank. 
Doing  so  will  increase  TSS  and  BOD  removal  as  well  as  possibly  decrease  the  amount  of 
chlorine  necessary  to  disinfect.  I  recommend  that  a  lab  analysis  of  the  effluent  from  the  current 
treatment  scheme  be  performed  as  well  as  after  the  primary  treatment  process  is  put  online  in 
order to determine the efficiency and benefits of this process. 
INTERVIEW 4: COMPASS POINT MARINA 
Compass  Point  Marina,  a  complex  consisting  of  a  marina,  commercial  offices,  restaurants,  and 
apartments,  is  located  near  Benner  Bay  on  St.  Thomas.    Compass  Point  also  utilizes  R/O 
technology  to  generate  its  drinking  water.  This  facility  is  permitted  for  and  produces 
approximately  2,500  gallons  of  drinking  water  per  day  by  utilizing  a  seawater  intake.  The 
manager of Compass Point Marina would be very interested in connecting to a water main along 
route 30 to the Red Hook area if and when WAPA installs this line. 

Wastewater at Compass Point Marina is treated at an on-site treatment plant that utilizes primary 
treatment.  Raw  sewage  enters  the  treatment  system  into  a  2,500-gallon  tank  and  is  then  sent  to 
one of  two clarifying  tanks  that aerate  the  sewage.  Treated water  is  then disinfected by chlorine 
tablets  prior  to  being  stored  for  use  in  irrigation  and  toilet  flushing.  Approximately  750  gpd  is 
utilized for  irrigation and 1000 gpd for  toilet flushing since  the marina does not have a permit  to 
discharge  treated effluent  to  the ocean.  Unfortunately, no  testing of effluent has been performed 
so  no  indication  of  treatment  efficiency  and  effluent  quality  is  known.    Currently,  this  complex 
has not implemented water conservation practices. 
INTERVIEW 5: POINT PLEASANT RESORT 
Point  Pleasant  Resort  is  located  in  Smith  Bay  on  the  eastern  end  of  St.  Thomas.  There  are  125 
permanent  residents  that  utilize  approximately  10,000  gpd  of  drinking  water  and  send 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources 

48 

approximately  10,000  gpd  to  an  on-site wastewater  treatment  plant.   Drinking water  is  obtained 
by extracting brackish water from an on-site well and treated using R/O technology.  

The wastewater treatment plant at Point Pleasant Resort was upgraded in 2001 with aeration and 
ultra-filtration membrane  technology.   As  indicated by an  increase  in  removal  levels of TSS and 
BOD,  this  technology  seems  to be a good  investment  for  the  resort.  The only problem  to  report 
is that the system can become fouled if the grease trap is not working properly.  Once wastewater 
travels  through  the  filtration  system,  it  passes  through  an  automated  chlorine  disinfection  unit 
and  then  is  stored  in  one  of  two  25,000  gallon  cisterns.   All  treated  grey  water  is  used  for 
irrigation  and  toilet  flushing.  Currently,  no  water  conservation  practices,  other  than  reuse  of 
wastewater effluent, or equipment have been put into place at this complex. 
INTERVIEW 6: CORAL WORLD 
Located  on  the  point  of Coki Bay  in St. Thomas, Coral World  is  a well-known  aquarium whose 
livelihood depends on the state of the environment.  Coral World has a drinking water demand of 
3,000 to 3,500 gpd and a large amount of waste to treat and dispose of.  In order to meet drinking 
water  demand,  water  is  not  only  generated  using  the  permitted  R/O  desalination  plant,  but 
rainwater  cisterns  and  tanker  trucks  also  provide  water  for  the  complex  since  Coral  World’s 
location prohibits  the use of WAPA  service.  Unfortunately,  the R/O  facility  is not obtaining  the 
yield that is typical for the rest of the facilities on the island that were toured.  Currently, the R/O 
plant produces 2 gallons per minute (gpm) of drinking water and 12 gpm of waste brine. 

Along  with  drinking  water,  Coral  World  also  must  also  treat  its  own  wastewater.    Traditional 
treatment  processes  consisting  of  extended  aeration  and  chlorine  disinfection  are  utilized.  The 
wastewater  treatment  plant  has  a  capacity  of  20,000  gpd.  Treated  effluent  is  then  stored  in  a  
4,200-gallon  holding  tank  before  being  used  for  irrigation  around  the  park.    Early  in  2002, 
several  ducks  at  the  park  showed  signs  of  illness  and  eventually  perished.  In  July,  a  sample  of 
effluent was  sent  to  the Ocean  Systems  Laboratory  on  St. Croix  for  analysis  of  TSS, BOD,  and 
fecal  coliforms.  The  analysis  showed  a  very  high  fecal  coliform  level.  The  manager  believes 
that the treated effluent/irrigation water was the most likely cause of the illness amongst the duck 
population at  the park.  Grey water  is no  longer used  to  irrigate around  the duck pond but  is  still 
used for irrigation at other locations around the park and the disinfection unit was adjusted to add 
more chlorine to the primary effluent. 

Coral  World  had  problems  with  its  irrigation  sys tem:  disinfection  of  gray  water  as  well  as 
clogging of the irrigation system.  After looking at the setup of the grey water irrigation system, I 
recommend  that  Coral  World  purchase  and  install  a  typical  pool  filter  of  the  appropriate  size 
similar  to  decrease  the  total  suspended  solids  in  the  grey  water  prior  to  being  sent  through  the 
irrigation  system. 
In  order  to  make  sure  that  the  grey  water  is  being  disinfected  to  the 
appropriate level, a litmus test to detect the total free chlorine in the system is recommended. 

REUSE, CONSERVATION, AND DISPOSAL ALTERNATIVES 
Because  the  two  large  municipal  wastewater  plants,  the  St.  Thomas  Mangrove  Lagoon 
Wastewater  Treatment  Plant  (MLWWTP)  and  the  St.  Croix  Wastewater  Treatment  Plant 
(SCWWTP), in the US Virgin Islands have not developed comprehensive reuse and conservation 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources 

49 

programs,  preliminary  plans  and  costs  for  eight  potential  reuse  and  conservation  alternatives 
have been developed. 
BASIS FOR COST ESTIMATING 
In  order  to  provide  analysis  of  the  various  alternatives,  the  costs  of  standard  activities  for  all 
projects  were  estimated.  These  costs  are  then  used  on  a  per-alternative  basis.    All  total  costs 
include  a  25%  factor  to  cover  contingency,  engineering,  and  startup.  Table  18  summarizes  the 
unit costs that will be used to evaluate each reuse alternative. 

A unit cost  for  residential  irrigation  systems was determined using data given by Sheikh, Castle, 
Kasper  and  Roxon  (2002).  This  unit  cost  includes  materials,  permit  fees,  installation, 
maintenance, and annual  inspections.   Using Engineering News Record  (ENR) construction cost 
indexes  of  6283  and  6627,  a  cost  per  typical  residential  irrigation  system  of  $3375  in December 
2000 was increased to $3560 in March 2003.  Operation and maintenance cost were not included 
since individual residences are responsible for those costs.    

A  distribution  network  is  needed  to  transport  the  reclaimed  water  to  its  intended  use.  The  cost 
per foot of polyvinylchloride (PVC) pipe was determined using unit costs from the CostWorks © 
program  developed  by  R.S.  Means  Company  (2003).    Unit  costs  include  materials,  labor,  and 
equipment to install a distribution network in San Juan, Puerto Rico since cost information is not 
available for the US Virgin Islands.  Annual operation and maintenance cost was estimated to be 
10%  of  the  construction  cost.  Excavation  and  backfilling  of  the  ditches  are  not  included  in  the 
unit  cost  per  linear  foot.  Therefore,  a  unit  cost  of  $37.20  per  cubic  yard  of  excavated  soil  was 
determined. 

The EPA Manual for Constructed Wetlands Treatment of Municipal Wastewaters includes a case 
study  of  nine  constructed wetland  systems  throughout  the United  States  used  to meet  secondary 
effluent standards (USEPA, 2000a).  The study examined both free water surface wetland (FWS) 
systems  and  vegetated  submerged  bed  (VSB)  systems.  For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  FWS 
systems will be examined.  Utilizing ENR  indexes of 5854 and 6627, a unit construction cost of 
$52,700  per  acre  in  August  1997  was  increased  to  $59,650  per  acre  in  March  2003.    It  was 
assumed  that  the US Virgin  Islands Government already owns  the  land needed  for each wetland 
system.  Annual operation and maintenance cost will also be included using a factor of 7%. 

There  are  currently  many  water  and  energy  conservation  vendors  that  supply  products  and 
information  to  promote  conservation  of  water  and  energy  resources.  AM  Conservation  Group 
Inc.  offers  the  E’Town  Water  Conservation  Kit  that  includes  a  2.5-gallons  per  minute  (gpm) 
showerhead, 1.5-gpm bath aerator, toilet tummy, dye tablet and instructions (2003).

REUSE, CONSERVATION, AND DISPOSAL ON ST. THOMAS 
In August of 2002,  construction of  the MLWWTP was  completed.   Currently,  the MLWWTP  is 
operating  in  conjunction with  a  subset  of  the  seven  original wastewater  treatment  plants.  As  of 
January 2003, only 130,000 gpd is being treated by the MLWWTP plant, but the average flow is 
expected  to  reach  750,000  gpd  by  2005  with  a  maximum  flow  of  1.25  million  gallons  per  day 
(MGD)  after  all  of  the  other  treatment  plants  are  taken  off-line  (DeRossett  and  Senn,  2003).   A 
majority  of  secondary  effluent  from  the MLWWTP  is  discharged  into  Stalley  Bay  with  a  small 
portion of the flow used for irrigation on the grounds of the treatment plant. 

Three  alternatives  were  examined  for  the  MLWWTP.  Combinations  of  irrigation  to  nearby 
residential customers and wetland augmentation reuse with and without conservation prove to be 
viable reuse options for the MLWWTP.  Preliminary design options for residential irrigation and 
wetland  augmentation were  developed  and  are  presented  in  the  following  paragraphs.  Financial 
information for all alternatives is presented in Table 16. 
Residential Irrigation 
Many  residential  units  are  located  near  the MLWWTP.  Through  the  use  of  a  7.5-minute  series 
topographic  map  updated  by  the  United  States  Geological  Survey  (USGS)  in  1982  it  was 
estimated  that  reclaimed  water  for  irrigation  could  be  provided  to  approximately  260  housing 
units along Route 30 with the installation of approximately 17,000 feet of piping. 

A 1996 USGS report dealing with the use of reclaimed water for golf course irrigation in Florida, 
reported  that  297  MGD  were  utilized  to  irrigate  65%  of  Florida’s  1448  golf  courses  (USGS, 
1996).  As  a  result,  an  average  of  2303  gpd  is  used  for  irrigation.  Using  this  irrigation  rate  and 
the  approximate  acres  requiring  irrigation  from  topographic  maps,  an  estimated  average  of 
200,000 gallons per day  is  required.  For design purposes a peaking  factor of  three was used.  A 
design flow of 595,000 gallons per day can be fed via one 8-inch PVC pipe. 
Habitat Restoration Utilizing Wetlands 
Based  on  the  USEPA  case  study  described  previously  and  utilizing  land  owned  by  the  Virgin 
Islands  Government,  wetlands  can  be  constructed  to  supply  additional  treatment,  provide  a 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources

habitat  for  various  plant  and  animal  species,  and  provide  an  educational  tool  for  St.  Thomas 
residents and visitors.   Using design principles and examples presented  in Chapter 4 of  the EPA 
Manual  for  Constructed  Wetlands  (USEPA,  2000a)  and  assuming  the  entire  flow  of  750,000 
gallons per day flows through the wetland, 5 acres are needed. 
Community-wide Conservation and Habitat Restoration 
Distributing  water  conservation  kits  and  information  throughout  the  St.  Thomas  community 
could  potentially  reduce  the  amount  of  wastewater  needing  treatment  by  the  MLWWTP. 
Utilizing  the conservation estimates cited previously, a household could conserve approximately 
35 gpd by implementing the kits distributed.  Based on the 2000 US Census, an estimated 24,030 
households  on  St.  Thomas  could  receive  water  conservation  kits  (2002).  The  reduced 
wastewater  flow  from  13,748  households  having  connections  to  the  municipal  sewer  system 
results  in  a  flow  of  269,000  gallons  per  day  requiring  treatment.  Assuming  that  100  percent  of 
the flow is treated by the wetland, 1.75 acres are needed. 

Reuse, Conservation, and Disposal on St. Croix 
The SCWWTP discharges  treated  effluent via  an ocean outfall.  Since  the  early 1970’s, primary 
treatment  with  chlorine  disinfection  has  been  utilized  treating  an  average  of  2.5  MGD.  The 
current  TPDES  permit  for  this  facility  allows  a maximum  effluent  discharge  of  4 MGD.    In  the 
past, the St. Croix WWTP has had problems meeting their TPDES permit limits and was covered 
under  a  consent  decree  with  the  USEPA  in  1984  that  was  also  placed  on  the  St.  Thomas 
wastewater  treatment  plants. 
In  January  2003,  the  St.  Croix  Department  of  Public  Works 
published  a  Request  for  Proposals  (RFP)  for  the  design  of  secondary  treatment  facilities  for  the 
SCWWTP.  As a  result of  this RFP and growing community awareness of water  scarcity  issues, 
a group called  the Coalition for Comprehensive Development has been advocating reuse options 
(Glogger, 2003). 

Five alternatives were examined for the SCWWTP.  Preliminary design options these options are 
presented in the following paragraphs.  Financial information is presented in Table 19. 
Airport Irrigation 
Due  to  the proximity of  the St. Croix wastewater facility  to  the airport, reclaimed water could be 
distributed  via  a  new  distribution  network  for  irrigation  needs  with  little  to  no  disruption  to  the 
surrounding  businesses.  Through  the  use  of  USGS  7.5-minute  topographic  maps  (Topozone, 
2003),  it was  determined  that  approximately  7.5  acres would  require  irrigation  and  4800  feet  of 
piping  would  be  necessary  to  distribute  irrigation  water  from  the  SCWWTP  along  Route  64  to 
the  Airport  main  entrance.    Using  the  irrigation  rate  used  previously  and  the  area  requiring 
irrigation  at  the  airport,  an  estimated  17,000  gpd  is  required.  For  design  purposes  a  peaking 
factor of three was used.  The peak flow rate of 51,000 gpd can be fed via 6-inch PVC pipe. 
Commercial Irrigation and Industrial Process/Cooling Water 
A  local  developer  is  looking  to  renovate  the  former ALCOA  facility  into  an  eco-industrial  park 
that  would  include  facilities  for  commercial,  industrial,  and  retail  clients  as  well  as  recreational 
parks and wetlands  (York, 2003).  Utilizing  the same  irrigation  rate used previously and a  rough 
estimate  of  the  acres  requiring  irrigation  at  the  new  industrial  area,  the  total  flow  needed  was 
estimated as 276,000 gpd.  Utilizing a peaking  factor of  three,  irrigation  flow can be  transported 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources 

52 

to  the  site  via  one  10-inch  diameter  PVC  pipe  with  approximately  2000  feet  of  new  piping. 
Industrial  tenants  have  not  been  identified  as  of  January  2003.  Therefore,  water  demand  and 
required  water  quality  are  not  known.    Because  of  this,  a  cost  estimate  for  this  portion  of  the 
alternative was not developed. 
Agricultural Irrigation 
Approximately  700  acres  of  agricultural  land  is  productive  (James,  2003).  According  to  the 
Virgin  Islands  Department  of  Agriculture,  a  new  marketing  campaign  is  being  implemented  to 
increase  the  amount  of  productive  land  used  for  agriculture.  Based  on  a  projected  increase  in 
demand  and  the  fact  that water  is  supplied  to  these  areas via  a  combination of wells,  ponds,  and 
trucked water  from WAPA,  an  alternative  source  of  irrigation water may  be  supported  by  local 
advocacy groups such as the St. Croix Farmers in Action for economical reasons. 

Based on GIS information (USVI CDC, 2001), it was estimated that approximately two-thirds of 
the  700  acres  of  productive  agricultural  land  is  both  relatively  close  to  the  SCWWTP  and 
grouped  together.  Using  the  previously  mentioned  irrigation  rate,  the  average  demand  was 
estimated  to  be  1,080,000  gpd.  Utilizing  a  peaking  factor  of  two,  the  distribution  system  was 
designed to transport 2,160,000 gpd via 27,000 feet of 16-inch diameter PVC pipe. 
Habitat Restoration Utilizing Wetlands 
Utilizing  a  combination  of  land  owned  by  the  Virgin  Islands  Government,  wetlands  could  be 
constructed to supply additional treatment, provide a habitat for various plant and animal species, 
and provide an educational  tool for St. Croix residents and visitors.  Currently,  this alternative  is 
being  proposed  by  one  group  of  engineers  in  answer  to  the  January  2003  RFP  administered  by 
the  US  Virgin  Islands  DPW.  Using  design  principles  and  examples  presented  Chapter  4  of  the 
EPA  Manual  for  Constructed  Wetlands  (USEPA,  2000a)  and  assuming  the  maximum  design 
flow of 4 MGD flows through the wetland, 71 acres are needed. 
Community-wide Conservation and Habitat Restoration 
A  water  conservation  program  implemented  throughout  the  St.  Croix  community  involving  the 
distribution  of  water  conservation  kits  and  information  could  potentially  reduce  the  amount  of 
wastewater  needing  treatment  by  the  SCWWTP.    Using  the  water  savings  described  previously 
and  the  2000  US  Census  information,  an  estimated  23,782  households  on  St.  Croix  would 
receive  water  conservation  kits  (2002).  The  reduced  wastewater  flow  from  11,758  households 
having connections  to  the municipal  sewer  system  results  in a  flow of 3,590,000 gallons per day 
requiring treatment.  Using this flow, 65.5 acres are needed. 
RECOMMENDED REUSE, CONSERVATION, AND DISPOSAL ALTERNATIVES 
The  previous paragraphs  presented  information  leading  to  construction  cost  for  each  alternative. 
Table  19  summarizes  those  costs.  Determining  the  net  present  cost  of  a  project  allows  for  a 
comparison  of  alternatives  on  a  similar  financial  basis.  The  net  present  cost  was  calculated 
assuming  a  3% discount  rate  over  a  20-year useful  life of  the project.   The  total net present  cost 
for a project equals the sum of the net present cost for each year (Brealey and Myers, 2000).

USVI WATER RESOURCES CONCLUSIONS 
The  future  of  water  resources  in  the US Virgin  Islands  lies  in  the  implementation  of  innovative 
water  resources  management  and  planning.  As  has  been  discussed  throughout  the  CRABS 
project  and  in  more  detail  in  individual  theses,  the  combination  and  improvement  of  different 
augmentation strategies are possible in the islands.  CRABS has developed ten recommendations 
for water resources strategies in the US Virgin Islands that are presented below. 

1)  Desalination  plants  by  distillation  should  be  gradually  phased  out  as  the  only  source  of 
public  water.  The  options  that  should  be  analyzed  have  been  discussed  in  this  report. 
Technologies such as  reverse osmosis  (RO) desalination and submarine piping should be 
considered as future options.  These alternatives are preferred based on both cost analysis 
and  sustainability  considerations.  Submarine  piping  from  Puerto  Rico  can  be  combined 
with  strategically  distributed  smaller  RO  plants,  to  achieve what  has  been  postponed  for 
many years in the islands, an equitable distribution of the available water resources. 

2)  The  desalination  industry  is  making  progress  toward  sustainable  operation.    The  new 
Caneel  Bay  plant,  which  represents  the  newest  technological  advances  and  incorporates 
the  newest  research,  had  the  best  score  for  each  of  the  social,  economic,  and 
environmental  indicators.  For  a  few  individual  indicators  other  plants  had  similar 
sustainability  scores, but when  the  scores  for  all  five  indicators were  summed  in  the  first 
sustainability  assessment  and  when  the  scores  for  the  fuel  and  cost  indicators  were 
summed  in  the  second  sustainability  assessment,  the  new  Cannel  Bay  plant  clearly  was 
operating  at  a  more  sustainable  level.  The  fact  that  the  newest  desalination  plant  in 
operation  in  the U.S. Virgin  Islands  had  the  highest  sustainability  score  is clear evidence 
that  the  treatment  processes  in  the  desalination  industry  are  moving  towards  sustainable 
operation.  Because  of  this  trend  in  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands,  in  which  processes  are 
moving  towards  sustainable  operation,  this  study  can  conclude  that  the  desalination 
industry  worldwide  is  moving  towards  sustainable  operation.  Due  to  decreasing  costs 
and  fuel  consumption,  desalination  treatment  processes  are  making  less  of  a  social, 
economical,  and  environmental  impact  on  the  ability  of  future  generations  to  meet  their 
own needs. 

Continued progress towards sustainability is expected as the desalination field gains more 
acceptance  as  a  public  water  supply  source  due  to  falling  costs  in  its  operation  and 
increasing  costs  associated  with  traditional  water  sources.    Continued  research  and 
technological  developments  will  drive  economic  forces  to  reduce  operational  costs  and 
will drive the industry’s progress towards sustainable operation. 

3)  Despite  St.  John’s  significant  solar  resources  and  only  fair  wind  resources,  wind  energy 
has  been  found  the  most  promising  renewable  energy  to  move  St.  John’s  vapor 
compression  desalination  plant  toward  sustainability.  Not  only  is  the  proposed  wind 
energy design able to meet a greater proportion of the energy needs of desalination, but it 
also  has  a  relatively  low  land  area  requirement,  compared  to  solar  thermal  and  even 
photovoltaics,  and  is  available  throughout  the  day  for  24  hour/day  desalination  plant

operation.  Furthermore,  as  it  is  a well  established  energy  source,  used  in  small  scale  by 
others on the islands, it is likely to be well accepted by WAPA officials as well. 

4)  Water reuse, conservation and disposal should be the other fundamental component of an 
integrated  water  resources  innovative  management  and  planning  policy.    CRABS 
presents an assessment of water reuse and conservation practices in the US Virgin Islands 
and  identifies  eight  reuse  alternatives  that  could  be  implemented  by  local municipalities. 
Out  of  those  eight  alternatives,  habitat  restoration  on  both  St.  Thomas  and  St.  Croix, 
community-wide  conservation  and  habitat  restoration  on  both  St.  Thomas  and  St.  Croix, 
and agricultural  irrigation on St. Croix, are  the most economical based on  the normalized 
cost per gallon of reclaimed and conserved water.  However, agricultural irrigation on St. 
Croix  and  community-wide  conservation  and  habitat  restoration  on  St.  Thomas  and  St. 
Croix  provide  the  most  benefit  to  the  community.  Agricultural  irrigation  provides 
farmers  a  low-cost  option  to  meet  water  demand  and  production  requirements. 
Community-wide conservation and habitat restoration alternatives provide an educational 
environment and promote conservation practices thus reducing water consumption, water 
cost, and wastewater production. 

5)	 From  the  assessment  it  is  apparent  that  reclaiming  wastewater  effluent  results  in  a 
reduction  of  nutrient-rich  effluent  discharged  to  the  ocean,  conservation  of  fresh-water 
sources,  reduction  of  energy  and  pollution  due  to  lower  production  needed  by  WAPA, 
and  avoidance or delay  in WAPA  expansion  to meet non-potable water  needs.   The  next 
step  before  undertaking  design  of  a  reuse  project  is  to  incorporate  several  components 
prior to ensure success.  Those components include: 
a)  Public information and participation,

b)  Public health impact identification, and

 Local and federal government participation.

c)

6)  Another  issue  is  the  necessity  to  monitor  the  water  quality  of  rainwater  catchments 
(RWC)  and  groundwater  sources.  RWC  and  groundwater  are  fundamental  sources  of 
water  in  the  islands  and  should  be  treated  as  other  water  supplies,  investing  in  new 
technologies for proper conservation of the resource as well as its augmentation. 
7)  It  is  also  fundamental  that  innovative  technological  change be backed with  legal  reforms 
that  will  enable  water  trading.    These  policies,  combined  with  a  higher  level  of 
interconnectivity,  will  enable  the  gradual  development  of  a  regional  water  market. 
Voluntary  water  transfers  are  a  good  response  of  the  government’s  legal  authority  that 
and  serve  as  a  complementary  mechanism  of  water  augmentation  and  demand– 
management  policies.  If  properly  implemented  from  both  the  operational  and water  use 
regulation  perspectives,  water  trading  can  bring  greater  economic  efficiency  to  the 
market.  Water  transfers  represent  an  efficient  economic  alternative  in  response  to  the 
combination of increasing water demands, environmental concerns, and exhaustion of the 
most economic water sources over the last several decades (Mays, 2002). 
8)  By applying in whole or in part the technologies and guidelines of CRABS recommended 
by CRABS,  funds will be  saved as  the  result of more cost effective alternatives.  In  turn, 
these  funds  should  be  applied  to  expand  the  public  system.  This  can  result  in  a  positive 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources	

56 

cyclical  pattern.  Incorporating  54%  (in  the  case  of  St.  Thomas)  of  the  population  to  the 
system will  increase  in  time  the  revenues generated by  the water  sector and will  result  in 
a benefit  to  the community.  This cycle will make more funds available over  time, which 
can be applied in turn to face the future challenges of the water resources sector. 
9)  Interconnectivity  within  and  between  islands  for  allocating  water  from  different  sources 
should be encouraged.  In addition, the interconnection between islands has the advantage 
of  expanding  the  economy  of  scale  of  a  reduced  island  market,  which  will  generate  the 
beneficial  economic  effect  of  market  expansion.  Another  strong  reason  for 
interconnection of available regional resources has to do with the pattern of occurrence of 
extreme events  like hurricanes.   Hurricanes  take different paths  in different years, and do 
does not always hit twice in the same island.  In the event of a given hurricane that affects 
any  of  the  interconnected  islands,  the  rest  of  them  that  have  not  suffered  the  hurricane’s 
full rigor will be readily able to supply water until damages can be corrected. 
10) Water  scarcity  is  not  only  the  result  of  climatic  and  geographical  conditions,  but  it  also 
depends on adequate management and planning of  the present and  future  resources.   The 
inventory of  the  available water  resources mentioned  throughout  this work  in  addition  to 
an  adequate  conjunctive  use  strategy  and  a  planned  augmentation  of  sources  will  make 
water scarcity past history.

IV.  ST. JOHN SALT POND WATER QUALITY 

The  climate  of  St.  John  is  classified  as  subtropical  with  the  winters  being  mild  and  dry,  and 
summers warm and humid.  Precipitation increases with altitude due to the moist air being forced 
up the slopes into the cooler air of the higher altitudes.  Since the mountains are not very high as 
compared  to  other  larger Caribbean  islands, most of  the precipitation  falls  in  the Caribbean Sea. 
Annual rainfall ranges from 40  to 60  inches (Colon-Dieppa et al., 1989).   February or March are 
the  driest  months  and  September,  October,  or  November  are  the  wettest  (see  Figure  11  below). 
High evapotranspiration  rates  reduce  the quantity of  surface water available  (Jordan and Cosner, 
1973).

FIGURE 10 
AVERAGE ANNUAL RAINFALL FOR ST. JOHN, USVI 
Soil Survey of the United States Virgin Islands (USDA, 1998) 

The  islands  are  composed  of  volcanic  rock  and  have  steep  slopes  and  irregular  coastlines. 
Groundwater  on  the  islands  is  scarce.    Surface  runoff  and  groundwater  recharge  are  low  due  to 
high rates of evapotranspiration.  Runoff ranges from 2  to 8 percent of annual rainfall (Santiago-
Rivera and Colon-Dieppa, 1986). 

Formed by  the gradual closing of sheltered bays as neighboring reefs grow upwards and create a 
berm,  salt  ponds  are  eventually  closed  off  from  the  neighboring  seawater.  While  exceptions  do 
exist in the USVI (as some ponds have been opened to the ocean to allow for intertidal flushing), 
the  hydrology  of  salt  ponds  is  dominated  by  inflows  from  groundwater  seepage,  surface  runoff, 
coastal  wave  overwash,  and  precipitation,  and  outflows  from  evapotranspiration  and 
groundwater seepage. 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources

Salt  ponds  serve  several  valuable  ecological  functions  in  the USVI,  two  of which  are  especially 
relevant  to  this  report.  First,  salt  ponds  serve  as  a  habitat  for  many  indigenous  as  well  as 
migratory  species,  some  of  which  are  endangered  or  threatened  under  the  classifications 
developed  in  the  Endangered  Species  Act  (ESA).  Second,  salt  ponds  act  as  a  buffer  between 
areas of human development and the sensitive reef ecosystems, as sediment and pollution carried 
by groundwater flow and surface runoff is filtered by salt ponds before they reach the reefs. 

As  human  development  increases  in  the  USVI,  protection  of  salt  ponds  is  becoming  a  major 
concern.  Due  to  their  proximity  to  beaches,  many  salt  ponds  have  been  destroyed  for  the 
construction of beachfront property or marinas.  Population growth has not been accompanied by 
improvements in the sewage infrastructure, so salt ponds are bearing a greater nutrient load from 
the  greater  number  of  septic  tanks  in  use.  In  addition,  increases  in  deforestation  and  the  use  of 
unpaved roads are leading to heightened erosion, which results in sedimentation in salt ponds. 

In order to understand how human development is affecting salt ponds, CRABS focused on three 
specific areas of investigation.  First, we attempted to develop a hydrologic model to characterize 
the  inputs  to  salt  ponds.  Second,  we  analyzed  the  water  quality  of  salt  ponds  with  respect  to 
nutrients and  sedimentation  to quantify human  impact.  Third, we analyzed  salt pond ecology  to 
determine how this impact is affecting the ecosystems of the ponds. 

WATER QUALITY ANALYSIS 
As  mentioned  above,  salt  ponds  on  St.  John  are  experiencing  increased  threats  as  human 
development  expands  on  the  island  without  adequate  infrastructure  upgrades.  The  most  direct 
and  pervasive  threat  is,  of  course,  deliberate  destruction.  Many  salt  ponds  have  been  opened  to 
the  sea, made  into marinas,  or  deliberately  filled  in  order  to meet  the  demands  of  an  expanding 
population.  Specifically,  residents  have  complained  about  the  smell  of  salt  ponds,  their  indirect 
roles  as  waste  disposal  sites,  and  the  desire  to  create  space,  both  on  land  and  at  sea,  for 
development  of  the  island.  However,  the  increase  in  development  may  also  have  a  significant, 
though  less  intentional,  impact  on  the  chemistry  of  salt  ponds.  The  two  primary  threats  to  salt 
pond chemistry are nutrient loading and excess sedimentation. 

Nutrient loading occurs when groundwater or surface runoff passes through an area where septic 
tanks  are used  and  carries with  it  compounds  that have diffused  away  from  the  tank.  This  leads 
to  nitrogen  and  phosphorus  enriched water  flowing  down  the  hydraulic  gradient,  and  eventually 
entering  salt  ponds.  While  these  nutrients  are  necessary  for  life  in  water  bodies,  when  excess 
nutrients  enter  the  water,  algal  growth  is  stimulated,  leading  to  a  process  known  as 
eutrophication.  Eutrophication has two notably deleterious effects on pond life.  First, algal mats 
that  may  develop  can  block  sunlight  from  entering  the  pond  and  being  used  photosynthetically 
by other plants.  Second, eutrophication  results  in oxygen depletion  in water, which can kill  fish 
or other species that need dissolved oxygen to survive.  As septic tanks are the primary source of 
sewage  treatment  on  St.  John,  and  since  their  usage  is  increasing  as  the  population  of  St.  John 
continues  to  grow  without  significant  developments  in  infrastructure,  the  problem  of  nutrient 
loading  may  escalate. 
In  addition,  the  geology  of  St.  John  renders  traditional  septic  tank 
technology  less efficient.  As  topsoil  is  rarely greater  than  two  feet deep, and  in  some places not 
present, leach fields are often impossible to implement as part of sewage treatment.

Sedimentation  is  also  increasing  on  St.  John  due  to  increased  population  and  little  concern  for 
erosion  control.  As  more  unpaved  roads  are  built,  more  trees  are  cut  down,  and  more  people 
walk  around,  erosion  occurs  at  a  greater  rate.  This  erosion  results  in  high  levels  of  sediments 
being carried by surface water runoff, which can eventually end up  in coastal waters such as salt 
ponds.  Sedimentation can also impact photosynthetic plant life, as sediment particles can lead to 
light  scattering  in water.  In extreme cases, a condition known as  siltation may occur.  Common 
in  coral  reefs,  siltation  results  in  a  plant  species  being  covered  in  sediments  and  thus  starved  of 
light and oxygen.    In addition,  sedimentation  rates may play a  role  in  the decomposition of dead 
plant life. 

A  common  tool  used  by  engineers  to  understand  the  processes  that  lead  to  sedimentation  is 
hydrologic modeling.  Hydrologic models  are  tools  used,  among  other  things,  to predict  the  rate 
and  volume  of  runoff  that  will  occur  under  a  given  set  of  conditions.  These  conditions  include 
rainfall, soil types, coverage types, slope of land, and watershed area.  In this project, hydrologic 
models were used to determine  the  inflows  to  the pond by overland flow from rainfall runoff.   It 
was  theorized prior  to arrival on St. John  that a correlation existed between  the characteristics of 
runoff and the general health of the pond. 

The  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  assess  the  impact  of  human  development  on  salt  ponds  by 
investigating  the  relationships  between  the  chemistry  of  salt  ponds  and  the  hydrology  of  the 
surrounding  area.  Therefore,  aspects  of  pond  health  such  as  nutrient  levels,  sedimentation 
parameters, and water quality indicators were analyzed in conjunction with development metrics, 
watershed  descriptions,  and  runoff  characteristics.  In  addition,  the  feasibility  of  groundwater 
seepage measurement was  investigated,  as  this  seepage  could  play  a  key  role  in  determining the 
role that human development may play in salt pond chemistry. 

PROJECT METHODS 
WATERSHED MODELING 
A  GIS  dataset  for  the  island  of  St.  John,  which  provided  a  background  for  the  hydrologic 
analysis  of  St.  John,  was  collected.  It  includes  a  soil  survey,  hydrologic  unit  code  (HUC)  14 
watershed  boundaries,  subwatershed  boundaries  of  the  HUC  14  watersheds,  and  an  aerial 
photograph  of  St.  John.  Following  the  assembly  of  the  GIS  dataset,  hydrologic  watershed 
modeling  was  implemented  to  determine  the  watersheds  tributary  to  the  ponds  being  studied. 
Several methods were  used  to  determine  the  size  of  the watersheds  hydrologically  connected  to 
each  pond.  First,  the watershed  tool  imbedded  in  the  Spatial Analyst  extension  of ArcView  3.2 
software  was  used.  Second,  since  some  of  the  smaller  ponds  are  actually  smaller  than  the  30­
meter  cell  size  of  the  DEM,  the  watershed  tool  could  not  be  used.  For  these  ponds,  ArcView 
drawing  tools were used  to virtually  trace  the watershed boundaries and measure  the  traced area. 
Finally, some areas were measured using a planimeter, a drafting instrument used to measure the 
area of a graphically represented planar region. 

The  calculations  performed  by  HydroCAD  were  the  primary  descriptor  of  runoff  used  in  this 
study,  and  provided  valuable  information  regarding  the  relationships  between  nutrient  loading, 
sedimentation, and runoff.  These calculations used  inputs of watershed area, soil  type, coverage 
type,  and  curve  number  to  generate  outputs  describing  the  rate  and  volume  of  runoff.    Detailed

HydroCAD implementation is presented in Rose and Bossi (2003). 
ANALYSIS OF AMBIENT CONCENTRATIONS OF NUTRIENT LEVELS 
As  the  equipment  and  chemicals  used  in  this  study  had  to  be  transported  on  passenger  aircraft, 
the  resources  available  to  CRABS  determined  that  the  following  nutrients  could  be  analyzed  in 
-
-
+],  and  reactive 
samples  taken  from  salt  ponds:  nitrate  [NO3  ],  nitrite  [NO2  ],  ammonia  [NH4
-],  which  is  also  known  as  orthophosphate.  These  compounds  represent  the 
phosphate  [PO4
inorganic  nutrients  which  are  available  for  consumption  by  biological  processes.  All  four  of 
these  nutrients  were  analyzed  using  a  Hach  DR2010  Portable  Spectrophotometer  and  the  Hach 
reagents appropriate for each parameter. 

Water samples were collected from salt ponds and kept on  ice pending analysis.  Pursuant  to  the 
protocol  suggested  by  Hach,  all  samples  were  allowed  to  return  to  room  temperature  before 
reaction  with  Hach  reagents.    All  samples  were  filtered  to  remove  particles  which  may  have 
scattered  light,  thus  interfering  with  the  constant  absorption  path  length  necessary  to  obtain 
consistent results.  In addition, all samples were diluted to 35‰ salinity to mitigate the  effects of 
salt interference.  All calibration curves were also established for this salinity level. 

ANALYSIS OF SEDIMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS 
The  two  primary  characteristics  associated with  sedimentation  are  turbidity  and  total  suspended 
solids  (TSS).  Turbidity  is  a  parameter  used  to  describe  the  level  of  light  scattering  that  results 
from  particles  suspended  in  the water.  Scattering  results  in  a  lower  portion  of  the  incident  light 
being able  to penetrate  to  the deeper portions of a body of water, and high  levels of  turbidity are 
associated with poor pond health.  Measurement of turbidity levels was performed on site at each 
salt  pond  studied  by  means  of  a  Hach  Turbidimeter,  an  instrument  that  shines  light  at  a  known 
wavelength  through  a  sample  cell  of  known  length  and  measures  the  incident  and  resultant 
strength of the light beam to determine how much has been scattered. 

Total suspended solids reflect the amount of suspended particles in a given volume of water.  By 
using  a Millipore  filtration  device,  a  known  volume  of water  collected  from  each  salt  pond was 
filtered  through pre-tared (pre-weighed) filters,  thus  trapping all solids present  in  the water.   The 
filters  were  then  dried  overnight  in  an  oven,  allowed  to  cool  in  a  dessicator,  and  then  weighed. 
The  difference  in  mass  before  and  after  filtration,  when  combined  with  the  volume  of  water 
filtered, yields the concentration of suspended solids. 

ANALYSIS OF CHEMICAL HEALTH INDICATORS 
The  appropriate  indicators  for  judging  the  chemical  health  of  salt  ponds  were  determined  to  be 
temperature,  salinity,  dissolved  oxygen,  and  pH, which  are  important  indicators  for  pond  health 
for the following reasons: 
•	 Temperature – Biological activity and growth are extremely dependent on temperature, as 
are  aquatic  chemical processes.   As  temperature  increases, water becomes  saturated with 
oxygen at a lower concentration, which may be insufficient to sustain life. 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources	

62 

•	 Salinity  – The  speciation  of  the  ecosystems  present  in  salt  ponds  is  highly  dependent  on 
salinity.  Salinity  shows  a  high  degree  of  natural  variation,  as  the  salt  concentration  is 
dependent on evaporation and precipitation. 
•	 Dissolved  Oxygen  –  The  organisms  present  in  salt  ponds  depend  on  the  oxygen  that  is 
dissolved  in  the water  surrounding  them.  The  concentration  of  dissolved  oxygen  is  also 
susceptible to human activity by a number of mechanisms.  Especially relevant in the salt 
ponds  of  St.  John  are  inputs  of  nutrients,  which  lead  to  increased  biological  growth  and 
oxygen  consumption,  and  the  deposition  of  organic  matter  such  as  tree  leaves  which, 
when decomposing, take up oxygen. 
pH – While extreme levels of pH will obviously render life difficult for the ecosystems of 
salt  ponds, minor  fluctuations  can  also  impact  the  aquatic  chemical  processes  occurring. 
For  example,  the  form  that  nutrients  take  upon  entering  a  pond  and  their  subsequent 
availability for life is highly dependent on the pH of the pond water. 

•	

These parameters were measured using a submersible YSI-600XLM sonde with a digital display.  
Due  to  the  threshold  of  85‰  salinity  associated  with  the  YSI  equipment,  salinity  readings  for 
ponds with salinity levels greater than 85‰ were also taken using a handheld refractometer. 

FEASIBILITY OF GROUNDWATER MEASUREMENT AND COLLECTION METHODS 
Two  methods  of  measuring  and  collecting  groundwater  flow  were  evaluated  to  determine  their 
applicability  for  larger  scale  experiments  on  St.  John.  Seepage  meters  were  deployed  in 
Southside  Pond  and  functioned  well,  but  were  unable  to  be  used  in  any  other  pond  due  to 
incompatible  sediment  conditions.    Piezometers  were  also  used  at  Southside  Pond,  but  issues 
arose quickly due to the soil conditions and the lack of well development equipment. 
RESULTS 
The initial proposal of extensively sampling two to four ponds at extreme ranges of development 
was  expanded  to  include  ten  ponds  of  varying  development  levels.  Sampling  for  temperature, 
salinity,  pH,  DO,  turbidity,  TSS,  and  nitrates  was  carried  out  at  all  ponds.  Initially,  levels  of 
nitrite  and  ammonia were  also measured,  but  analysis  of  these  nutrients  consistently  resulted  in 
levels  lower  than  the  tolerances  associated  with  the  tests.  Hence,  sampling  for  nitrite  and 
ammonia  was  discontinued,  and  testing  for  phosphates  was  added  as  the  study  proceeded.  In 
addition, GIS and HydroCAD models were developed for the watersheds surrounding each of the 
ponds sampled. 

In order  to quantify  the  level of development  surrounding each pond, a development matrix was 
created by visually  surveying  the area near  the pond and determining  its  relative development in 
the following areas: 
•	 Number of surrounding houses 
•	 Proximity of surrounding houses 
•	 Slope of surrounding land 
•	 Predominant sewage treatment methods 
•	 Number of surrounding roads and paths 
•	 Proximity of surrounding roads and paths 
•	 Condition of roads and paths (dirt or paved)

•  Presence of agriculture or livestock 

The  ten  ponds  sampled  represent  a  range  of  development,  from  the  pristine  pond  adjoining 
Hanson Bay to Frank Bay pond in the heavily developed Cruz Bay area. 

The  data  collected  from  sampling  salt  pond  water  were  combined  with  the  outputs  of  the 
hydrologic  modeling  (which  included  runoff  characteristics  and  watershed  descriptions)  and  of 
the  development  matrix.  Multivariate  regressions  were  run  on  this  data  set  to  find  the 
relationships  between  the  chemistry  of  salt  ponds  and  the  hydrology  of  the  surrounding  area. 
The data set can is presented in Table 17.

Little  correlation  was  seen  between  nutrient  levels  and  any  aspect  of  development  or  runoff. 
However, a  significant correlation was  found  to exist between nitrate  levels and  salinity, as  seen 
in the Figure 11.

FIGURE 11 
SALINITY VS. NITRATE LEVEL 

The  linear  relationship  between  nitrate  and  salinity  levels  suggests  that  concentration  by 
evaporation  is  the  main  mechanism  leading  to  elevated  nutrient  concentrations.  In  order  to 
verify  this  suggestion,  a  plot was  constructed  by  calculating  the  nitrate  concentration  that would 
result  from  evaporation.  Chocolate  Hole  East,  which  is  a  pond  that  has  been  opened  to  the 
surrounding  bay  to  allow  for  flushing,  showed  salinity  readings  (average  33.58‰)  which  were 
extremely  close  to  the  surrounding  bay  water  (34.52‰).  The  close  salinity  values  suggest  that 
the  bay  water  has  thoroughly  mixed  into  the  pond.    If  the  average  nitrate  concentration  in  the 
pond  is  assumed  to  be  the  same  as  that  in  the  bay,  the  same  evaporation  calculations  can  be  run 
to  generate  a  range  of  nitrate  concentrations  at  differing  salinities  corresponding  to  those  that 
would  be  found  if  evaporation  took  place.  These  calculations were  performed,  and  a  graph was 
generated.  Figure  12  shows  that  the  measured  values  of  nitrate  correspond  very  closely  with 
those values expected at varying salinity levels, as their slopes only differ by 0.001.  Despite this 
minimal  difference,  the  deviations  from  expected  values  were  still  analyzed  to  search  for 
possible  relationships  with  development.  No  significant  correlations  were  found,  as  all 
regression  runs  resulted  in  F-tests  and  R2  values  that  were  insignificant.  The  results  of  all 
regressions run with Stata are provided by Bossi and Rose (2003).

The  groundwater  measurement  feasibility  study  also  produced  interesting  results.  Results  were 
obtained  from  the  seepage  meter  implementation  at  two  separate  locations  in  Southside  Pond. 
The  location  for  January  14th  and  15th was on  the  far  end of  the pond  from  the berm  (see Figure 
13).  The  slope  of  the  land  near  this  deployment  location  was  less  steep  than  the  other  sides 
(excluding  the  berm),  but  grew  steeper  near  the  northern  side  of  the  deployment.  At  this 
location, a pattern of groundwater flow was seen.  While almost all of  the meters at  this  location 
lost  water  from  their  bags,  a  behavior  known  as  downwelling,  those  closest  to  the  steeper 
northern  slope  showed  higher  rates  of  downwelling.  The  location  for  January  16th  and  17th (see 
Figure  X)  in  contrast,  showed  more  consistent  evidence  of  flow  into  the  seepage  meter  bags, 
otherwise  known  as  upwelling.  Downwelling  did  occur  in  those meters  furthest  from  the  berm, 
but  it  appeared  that  there  was  a  hinge  point  around  the  third  column.  Thus,  the  closer  to  the 
berm,  the  greater  the  upwelling  of  the  seepage  meter  (see  Bossi  and  Rose  (2003)  for  further 
analysis).

RECOMMENDATIONS & AREAS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH 
Several recommendations can be made that would improve the conclusions reached in this study. 
The  first  is  an  improvement  in  the  development matrix  to more  accurately  quantify  the  level  of 
development  surrounding  each  pond.  While  a  cursory  inspection  was  able  to  estimate  the 
number  of  homes  and  their  apparent  sewage  treatment  methods,  a  more  rigorous  examination 
could  determine  which  homes  are  hydrologically  connected  to  the  salt  ponds.    In  addition,  a 
survey  could  be  made  to  determine  the  actual  treatment  methods  in  place  and  a  better  sense  of 
the seasonal variations, if any, exist in the activity around each pond. 

In  addition,  coordination  with  other  scientific  bodies  interested  in  researching  salt  ponds  could 
improve  the  difficulties  faced  with  inadequate  resources.  Specifically,  the  chemicals  and 
apparatus  needed  to  analyze  the  levels  of  total  nitrogen  and  total  phosphorus  could  significantly 
advance the understanding of nutrient inputs to salt ponds. 

A  lack  of  confidence  exists  in  those  measurements  taken  with  the  YSI  in  ponds  with  salinities 
higher than 85‰.  Other methods of measuring dissolved oxygen and pH should be implemented 
in  these  ponds.    Similarly,  the  high  levels  of  salinity  encountered  resulted  in  corrosion  of  the 
packaging  of  the  TSS  filters,  resulting  in  a  lack  of  confidence.  Employing  other  methods  of 
packaging  or  transportation,  or  finding  the  laboratory  equipment  necessary  to  analyze  the 
samples on site, would result in higher levels of confidence.

ECOLOGICAL ANALYSIS 
OVERVIEW 
As  previously  discussed,  salt  ponds  serve  several  valuable  ecological  functions  in  the  United 
States  Virgin  Islands  (USVI),  although  they  have  traditionally  been  undervalued  and  poorly 
understood.  Although  species  diversity  may  be  lower  than  in  other  systems  (Montgomery, 
1966),  salt ponds are  some of  the most biologically productive ecosystems  in  the world.  So  far, 
however,  only  preliminary  research  has  been  performed  to  document  ecosystems  living  in  and 
depending on USVI salt ponds. 

Salt  ponds  are  considered  “unfriendly”  places  to  live  because  their  ambient  conditions  can 
change drastically  in  short periods of  time.  Although  they are quite  important  in  the ecosystem, 
it  is  extremely  difficult  to  live  permanently  in  a  salt  pond  because  of  the  large  range  and 
sometimes  rapid  changeability  of  the  conditions.  Because  of  the  difficulty  associated  with 
surviving  in  the  variability  of  salt  ponds,  only  the  hardiest  species  are  able  to  live  there.    The 
organisms  that  are  able  to  survive  in  the  ponds  are  various  species  of  macroinvertebrates, 
bacteria, and phytoplankton (Maho, undated). 

Four  types of mangroves exist on St. John and were  identified during  this study.   “Mangrove”  is 
a  term  used  to  characterize  a  group  of water-  and  salt-tolerant  plants  typically  found  in warmer 
climates  (Burke,  2001).  Over  50%  of  all  mangroves  in  the  USVI  have  been  destroyed  due  to 
anthropogenic  and  natural  sources  (particularly  hurricanes)  in  the  last  50  years.  Due  to  their 
thick  and  complex  root  networks,  mangroves  are  believed  to  provide  highly  effective  sediment 
filtration  for  runoff  that  would  otherwise  adversely  affect  the  marine  environment.    These  root 
networks  also  serve  to  prevent  bank  erosion  of  the  ponds  and  shore  erosion where  the  trees  are 
found  on  the  seashore.  Mangroves  are  particularly  susceptible  to  damage  via  trampling  and 
branch  breaking,  as  well  as  anchoring  practices,  ropes,  or  other  gear.    Therefore,  mangrove 
population characteristics may signal magnitude and types of disturbances at the ponds. 

The purpose of  this project  is  to gather and analyze  information on  salt ponds  to allow  informed 
decisions on how  to understand and  treat  them over  time.   This objective breaks down  into  three 
important pieces. 

1.  Provide a preliminary snapshot of the permanent ecosystem in the salt ponds 
Because of  the current  lack of knowledge about what organisms  live  in  the ponds, sampling was 
performed  to  determine  characteristics  of  each  pond.  Quantitative  measurements  included 
(among  others)  macroinvertebrate  identification,  chlorophyll  levels,  housing  density,  salinity, 
nitrates, dissolved oxygen, temperature, berm characteristics, and pH.  Qualitative measurements 
included  (among  others)  fringing  mangrove  community  characteristics,  sediment  descriptions, 
conversations with  landowners,  and  items  of  interest  specific  to  each  pond.  This  information  is 
meant  to  create  a  baseline  for  decision  making,  as  well  as  to  provide  a  basis  for  additional 
research and monitoring of salt ponds. 

2.  Recommend a range of indicators to determine the water quality of a salt pond 
Although  salt  ponds  on  St.  John  demonstrate  a wide  range  of  conditions  both  compared  to  each 
other and over time, relationships between different variables are evident and are analyzed in this 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources 

69 

study.  The  water  quality  of  a  pond  may  be  determined  using  a  subset  of  these  indicators,  and 
management strategies can then be implemented for each individual pond.  

3.  Suggest areas for further research 
After the establishment of baseline data on the salt ponds, additional research areas are suggested 
to  further knowledge of  the ponds.  Additional  field  research and ongoing monitoring can refine 
the pond characteristics and quality indicators to improve long-term oversight strategies.  
RESULTS 
A summary of all measurements taken can be found in Table 19. 
MANGROVES 
Mangroves  were  discovered  at  all  except  one  pond  in  the  study  (93%).    Red  mangroves  were 
observed at three ponds (20%), black mangroves at three ponds (20%), white mangroves at eight 
ponds (53%), and gray mangroves at nine ponds (60%).  The four species were found co-existing 
at  only  one  of  the  ponds  observed  (Elk  Bay  East  Pond).    Mangrove  occurrences  as  related  to 
pond salinity  levels were consistent with  the  literature (Nellis, 1994).  In general, red mangroves 
were  found  at  lower  salinity  ranges  (31-63‰),  black  mangroves  at  slightly  higher  ranges  (59­
69‰),  and  gray  (45-262‰)  and  white  (59-136‰)  mangroves  had  large  ranges  reaching  higher 
salinities. 
SALINITY 
For  the  fifteen  ponds  sampled,  salinity  ranged  from more  than  8  times  that  of  seawater  (262‰) 
to slightly below that of seawater (31‰) with an average of 93‰. 
HOUSING DENSITY 
Housing  density  data  varied  from  zero  houses  per  square  kilometer  in  more  remote  sections  of 
the island to just over 400 houses per square kilometer in  the most densely populated areas.  The 
wide range of values indicates a range of pond conditions from pristine to strongly influenced by 
human  development.   Higher  housing  density  probably  indicates more  runoff  into  the  pond  due 
to construction and traffic, and may also indicate increased nutrient influx from residential septic 
systems. 
NITRATE LEVELS 
In  this  study  nitrate  as  nitrogen was measured  for  eight  ponds.    “Nitrogen  compounds  enter  the 
environment  as  nitrates  or  are  converted  to  nitrates.  The  nitrates  come  from  many  sources 
including  agriculture,  fertilizers,  sewage,  and  drainage  from  livestock”  (Coulston  and 
Mussington, 1987).  Elevated nitrogen levels often signal current or impending algal blooms in a 
body of water, which may be harmful for other pond inhabitants. 
DISSOLVED OXYGEN 
Oxygen  in  the  water  enables  oxygen-dependant  organisms  to  live  in  it.    EPA  states  “waters 
classified  for  the  protection  of  fish  and  wildlife  must  contain  sufficient  dissolved  oxygen  to 
support aquatic  life”  (EPA, 1988).  Dissolved oxygen  levels  fluctuate over  the course of  the day 
as  well  as  seasonally,  but  very  low  levels  of  dissolved  oxygen  in  a  pond  indicate  ecological 
problems.  According  to EPA,  invertebrates experience some production  impairment at  levels of 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources 

70 

5  mg/L,  and  reach  an  acute  mortality  limit  at  4  mg/L  (EPA,  1999).    The  average  level  of 
dissolved oxygen measured in the ponds is 3.95 mg/L.

MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION RESULTS 
Multivariate  regression  analysis  determines  the  strength  of  correlation  among  an  independent 
variable and one or more dependent variables.  This analysis was performed on an iterative basis 
in  Microsoft  Excel  until  all  dependent  variable  p-values  are  less  than  0.05,  indicating  a 
confidence  level  of  greater  than  or  equal  to  95%  that  the  variables  are  correlated.   Multivariate 
regression results are presented for species richness, chlorophyll a, and dissolved oxygen.  

SPECIES RICHNESS 
In  the  multivariate  regression  analysis  of  species  richness,  the  most  significantly  correlated 
factors were berm height, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate levels.  

Species Richness = 0.70*Berm Height (m) – 0.60*Temperature (�C) – 1.66*pH + 0.94*Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L)  – 
0.19*Nitrate (mg/L as N) + 30.98 

With p-values of: 

R2 = 0.9944 

Variable 
Berm Height (m) 
Temperature (Degrees C) 
pH 
Dissolved oxygen (mg/L) 
Nitrate (mg/L as N) 

P-value 
0.0081 
0.0020 
0.0057 
0.0021 
0.0127 

Berm height may be an  indicator  for  the age of  the pond.  Since salt ponds are born as bays  that 
close  over  because  of  coral  growth,  a  higher  berm  probably  indicates  the  maturity  of  a  pond. 
Ponds that have been well established are also expected to have a well-developed ecosystem due 
to lessened variability of pond conditions.  Newer ponds may be subject to more ocean influence 
and  their  ecosystems may  be  in  the  process  of  evolving  from  the  original  to  a more  sustainable 
one. 

Temperature  and  pH  are  also  indicators  of  the  health  of  a  pond,  although  these  factors  do  not 
vary  widely  amongst  the  ponds  measured.  Variability  of  these  two  factors  should  be  assessed 
during  ongoing  pond  monitoring  to  determine  whether  fluctuations  in  temperature  or  pH  are 
something to be concerned about as opposed to “normal” seasonal fluctuations. 

It  is  no  surprise  that  dissolved  oxygen  is  so  closely  related  to  species  richness  because  of  the 
ecosystem’s dependence on oxygen.  The solubility of oxygen  in water decreases as  temperature 
and  salinity  increase,  which  affects  DO  levels  in  ponds  on  St.  John.  Many  of  the  types  of 
invertebrates  found  in  the  ponds  are  able  to  sustain  periods  of  depleted  oxygen  by  forming 
protective barriers or modifying other activities, so ponds with  lower oxygen  levels would  likely 
be capable of sustaining larger communities if the DO levels were allowed to increase (Guenther, 
undated).

Elevated  nitrates  are  usually  considered  to  be  indicative  of  current  or  future  problems  with 
macroinvertebrate  populations.    Algal  blooms  may  be  caused  by  an  overabundance  of  nitrates; 
when  this  occurs,  the  algae  eventually  blocks  the  light  and  chokes  the  pond,  subsequently  dying 
and  decaying  which  leads  to  hypoxic  conditions  (Thomann  and  Mueller,  1987).  Even  if  the 
nitrates are not leading to these eutrophic conditions, they indicate an external source of nutrients 
in the pond that will likely result in unfavorable conditions for the pond invertebrates.  

CHLOROPHYLL A 
In  the multivariate  regression  analysis,  chlorophyll was  significantly  related  to  temperature,  pH, 
dissolved oxygen, nitrate levels, and salinity levels.  

Chlorophyll  a  (µg/L)  =  –  1318.2*Temperature  (�C)  –  15125.5*  pH  +  1889.0*Dissolved  Oxygen  (mg/L)  + 
15368.8*Nitrate (mg/L as N) – 666.7*Salinity (‰) + 173000.69 

With p-values of: 

R2 = 0.955 

Variable 
Temperature (Deg C) 
pH 
Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L) 
Nitrates (mg/L as N) 
Salinity (‰) 

P-value 
0.0442 
0.0134 
0.0372 
0.0236 
0.0211 

Chlorophyll  a  levels  have  a  measured  correlation  with  all  the  elements  that  enhance  or  hinder 
phytoplankton  growth.  First,  chlorophyll  levels  in  the  ponds  are  correlated  with  dissolved 
oxygen  levels.  Oxygen  is generated by photosynthesis  by phytoplankton at the base of the pond 
food  chain  (Grove,  1998),  and  this  is  evident  in  the  positive  correlation  between  the  two  data 
sets.  Nitrates are positively correlated with chlorophyll levels due to the nitrogen-dependence of 
the plants growing in the ponds.  Increased nitrate levels lead to increased phytoplankton growth, 
which can be detrimental to other pond biota. 

Consistent  with  the  literature,  salinity  is  negatively  correlated  with  chlorophyll  a  levels 
(Bayrakdar,  1994).    Even  if  a  species  is  highly  tolerant  of  salinity  levels,  that  species  will 
generally do better in the lower part of its salinity range.  This is because less energy needs to be 
devoted  to  osmoregulation  of  the  organism  and  can  be  devoted  to  growth  (Swanson,  1998).  
Also, less oxygen is able to be dissolved in ponds with higher salinity levels. 

Again,  correlation  with  temperature  and  pH  should  be  further  measured  to  determine  the 
variability  in  these  two  factors  in  an  average  year  in  the  ponds,  and whether  greater  fluctuations 
have any significant effects.

DISSOLVED OXYGEN 
Dissolved oxygen  levels were also measured  for a pond  subset, and  these data may also be used 
to indicate or explore ecosystem “friendliness.”  In the multivariate analysis of dissolved oxygen, 
there was significant correlation determined with depth, berm height, temperature, and pH. 

Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L) = -0.24*Depth (ft) – 1.4*Berm height (m) + 0.37*Temperature (�C) + 1.85* pH – 17.98 

With p-values of: 

R2 = 0.9041 

Variable

Berm Height (m) 
Temperature (Deg C) 
pH 

P-value 
0.0151 
0.0059 
0.0294 
0.0259 

Dissolved  oxygen  is  inversely  correlated  with  berm  height.  This  correlation  may  be  explained 
by  the  amount  of  shelter  from  wind  that  the  berm  provides.  Higher  wind  speed  increases  the 
amount  of  oxygen  that  can  diffuse  into  a water  body  from  the  atmosphere;  a  lower  berm would 
provide less shelter from the wind and therefore more oxygen could dissolve into the water from 
the air (WOW, undated).  Inverse correlation with water depth may simply be a result of the ratio 
changes as a result of more water volume in deeper ponds. 

Temperature  and  pH  are  also  related  to  dissolved  oxygen  levels  although  these  values  are  fairly 
constant across the range of ponds sampled.   Again, measurement of fluctuations in these values 
would help to determine the extent and significance of the correlation. 
RECOMMENDATIONS & AREAS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH 
To  date,  few  data  have  existed  about  the  species  living  in  the  salt  ponds,  their  relationships  to 
each  other  and  the  ponds,  and  the  external  factors  that  affect  them.  To  fully  understand  and 
preserve the ecological value of these salt ponds, several actions are recommended as next steps. 

1.  Monitor sentinel species and metrics 
This  thesis  concludes  that  several  habitat  characteristics  and  species  may  be  considered 
“sentinels” for the relative health of a salt pond.  These parameters are easily monitored and may 
be  observed  on  an  ongoing  basis  by  trained  volunteers.    Changes  in  mangrove  community 
composition  or  distribution may  signal  important  changes  in  the  ponds.    Presence  or  absence  of 
fiddler crabs  is also easy  to monitor  in ponds.  Disappearance of  fiddler crabs  in ponds  indicates 
a  “red  flag”  that  a  pond  is  having  problems  sustaining  its  ecosystem.  Trash  levels  in  salt  ponds 
are  also  an  obvious  signal  that  ponds  may  be  in  danger.  Additional  study  will  suggest  other 
sentinel metrics available for monitoring. 

2.  Begin an ongoing salt pond measurement program 
Although  fifteen  ponds were  sampled  during  this  research  trip,  there  are more  than  thirty  ponds 
on  the  island.  Accessibility  issues,  time  constraints,  and  pond  dryness  all  contributed  to  the 
choice  of  ponds  for  this  study.  A  larger  sample  size  of  ponds  will  extend  the  data  sets  and 

CRABS  Caribbean Research Association for the Betterment of water resources 

74 

increase the statistical accuracy of the results.  Due to the lack of seasonal data, variations due to 
migratory  patterns,  rainfall,  and  other  seasonal  changes  will  not  be  adequately  represented  by 
this  study.  Seasonal  pond  measurements  will  provide  a  more  complete  picture  of  pond 
conditions and responses to external factors. 

3.  Perform nitrogen balance for ponds 
Although  the  nitrate  levels  seem  to  indicate  that  more  nitrates  are  present  in  the  ponds  than 
would occur simply from seawater evaporation,  there are not enough data at present  to speculate 
about additional sources of nitrogen in the ponds. There are many nitrogen sources and sinks that 
are  unaccounted  for  in  this  study.  For  example,  the  microbial  mats  common  in  hypersaline, 
evaporative environments act as a nitrogen sink for the water column (Stal and Caumette, 1994), 
but may  also  block  nitrogen  from  entering  through  the  groundwater.  Use  of  the  pond  basins  by 
livestock  and  domestic  and  feral  animals  is  a  source  of  nitrogen,  and  phosphorus  levels  may 
impact nitrogen cycling  in  the salt ponds.  Pond usage by birds may also affect nutrient  levels  in 
the  salt  ponds.  Additional  processes  including  denitrification,  sorption,  bacterial  fixation,  and 
atmospheric deposits should be considered.  A detailed nitrogen balance would help to determine 
sources, sinks, and impacts of nitrogen levels on the salt ponds. 

4.  Conduct sediment studies for ponds 
Salt  ponds  serve  as  sediment  filters  for  runoff on St.  John.    Increased  sedimentation  rates due  to 
the  construction  practices  and  lack  of  erosion  control  pose  a  serious  risk  to  macroinvertebrate 
communities  as  well  as  the  ponds  in  general.  Sediment  composition  and  history  may  provide 
some  insight  on  the  ecological  development  of  the  salt  pond  as well  as  the  chemical makeup  of 
each  salt  pond  environment.  Sedimentation  rates  and  content  should  be  studied  to  determine 
whether  this  is  a  significant  source  of  nutrients  in  the  ponds,  as  well  as  whether  and  to  what 
extent human activities are affecting the ponds. 

5.  Consider implementation of buffer zones 
An  adequate  buffer  is  crucial  to  preserving  salt  ponds.  Implementing  a  buffer will  be  easier  for 
some  ponds  than  others,  but  this  practice  may  be  best  suited  to  pond  basins  where  new  home 
construction is light or has not been started.  Buffered ponds may be used as controls for ongoing 
monitoring  as  well.  Buffering  ponds  may  consider  more  than  just  construction  practices. 
Limiting  foot  traffic  within  several  meters  of  the  pond  and/or  installing  fences  to  keep  goats, 
donkeys, and domestic animals away from the ponds should also be considered.

SALT POND CONCLUSIONS 
SENTINEL SPECIES 
Conclusions can be drawn about some of the taxa observed in the salt ponds in this study and the 
range of conditions  in which  they were observed.  Based on  the data collected  in  this  study,  it  is 
possible  to  identify  species  that  can  be  viewed  as  “sentinels”  for  conditions  in  the  pond.  One 
suggested  organism  is  ocypodidae,  which  is  present  in  a  wide  range  of  ponds  over  a  range  of 
salinities (31  to 192‰) and are  less  tolerant of other conditions  that are correlated with a decline 
in  species  richness.  These  macroinvertebrates,  commonly  known  as  fiddler  crabs,  are  easy  to 
identify  because  of  their  relatively  large  size  and  their  burrows  around  the  shallow  edges  of  the 
pond.  Presence of  ocypodidae  is a useful and  relatively easy  factor  to monitor during  long-term 
oversight  of  the  salt  ponds  as  a  high-level  indicator  of  other  factors  at  work  in  the  pond.    In 
addition to their range of presence and tolerance to environmental factors measured in this study, 
crabs are viewed by the literature as a sign of ecosystem health.  “Crabs are currently regarded as 
a  key  ecological  element  in  mangrove  forests”  (Drude  de  Lacerda,  2002).    Also,  “fiddler  crabs 
are  perhaps  the  most  common  macrospecies  in  the  mangrove  and  are  an  important  indicator 
species of changes  in hydrology and water quality;  they are among  the first organisms to leave a 
disturbed system” (Fifth, 1999). 

NITRATE SOURCES 
Nitrate  levels  are  shown  above  to  be  correlated  strongly  with  salinity,  which  suggests  that  the 
water  in  salt  ponds  may  be  composed  primarily  of  evaporated  seawater.  This  suggestion  is 
reinforced  by  the  lack  of  appreciable  runoff  (as  predicted  by  hydrologic  models)  and  the 
downwelling  seen  in  the  seepage meters  at  Southside  Pond.  In  addition,  nitrate  levels  and  their 
deviations  from expected  levels were not  found  to be correlated with any aspect of development 
or runoff used in this study. 

Thus,  the  results  of  this  study  seem  to  contradict  the  original  hypothesis  that  salt  pond  health  is 
adversely  affected  by  human  development. 
In  addition,  since  species  richness,  chlorophyll, 
nitrate,  and  dissolved  oxygen  measurements  are  not  significantly  correlated  with  housing 
density,  it  appears  that  human  population  density measured  in  houses  per  square  kilometer  does 
not  currently  cause  eutrophic  conditions  in  salt  ponds,  algal  blooms,  hypoxia,  or  decreased 
number  of  species.    These  results  do  not  suggest  that  if  land  development  continues  unchecked 
there  will  be  no  impact  on  salt  ponds,  but  rather  that  more  research  is  needed  to  determine  the 
extent that other human activities have on salt ponds.  As the human population density increases 
on  St.  John,  human  contributions  to  nutrient  loading  in  the  ponds  is  an  issue  with  which  to  be 
concerned. 

It  is  also  possible  that  the  full  extent  of  human  development  is  not  accurately  measured  by  the 
“housing density” metric or the “development matrix” metric.  Other factors may come into play 
including  runoff  from  different  types  of  roads  and  the  amount  of  travel  they  receive,  livestock 
contributions  to  nutrient  levels,  or  other  non-residential  land  uses.    Further  pond  study will  help 
to resolve these and other questions.
