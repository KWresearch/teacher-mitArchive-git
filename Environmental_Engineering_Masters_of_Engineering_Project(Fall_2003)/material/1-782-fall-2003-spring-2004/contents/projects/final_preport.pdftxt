1  Executive Summary 

The  Drugstore  Cowboys  Inc.  explored  the  fate  and  transport  tributyl  phosphate  (TBP), 
tri(2-chloroethyl)  phosphate  (TCEP),  and  tri(2-butoxyethyl)  phosphate  (TBEP)  in  the 
Chattahoochee  River  and  Chattahoochee  Water  Treatment  Plant  in  Atlanta,  GA.  These 
three  organophosphate  triesters  are  commonly  used  as  flame  retardants  and  plasticizers. 
Through  disposal  to  the  sewage  system,  these  xenobiotic  chemicals  enter  the 
environment, posing health risks to humans and biota. 

Mr.  Andrews  explored  natural  attenuation  within  the  Chattahoochee  River.    Samples 
were  collected  at  four  different  locations  along  the  river  and  analyzed  for  TBP,  TCEP, 
and TBEP  concentration.   These  values were  implemented  in  the  construction  of  several 
mass  balances  seeking  to  identify  the  presence  of  a  natural  sink.    A  separate  study  was 
completed  specifically  targeting  biodegradation  within  the  Chattahoochee.    Two 
additional  sets  of  samples were  analyzed  at  various  times  over  a  24-hour  period,  leading 
to  the  calculation  of  a  biodegradation  rate  for  each  compound.  The  results  indicate  that 
for  the  conditions  present  along  the  particular  reach  of  the  Chattahoochee  River  no 
removal mechanism exists.  

Mr.  Haffey  developed  a  numerical  model  of  the  reach  of  the  Chattahoochee  River 
extending downstream from Buford Dam to the GA 280 highway crossing in North West 
Atlanta.    The  aim  of  the  model  was  to  evaluate  the  magnitude  of  potential  sinks  within 
the  modeled  reach  and  to  make  predictions  of  the  concentration  distribution  of  all  three 
organophosphoric acid triesters.  The model was developed using WASP5 and supporting 
software  packages.  Model  predictions  showed  considerable  agreement  with 
concentration  observations  made  by  Mr.  Andrews  and  Mr.  Lin  in  the  January  sampling 
survey. The model predicted the phosphate ester concentration patterns in time and space 
and  showed  how  they  varied  with  the  diurnal  flow  variations  imposed  by  hydroelectric 
dams  located  within  the  reach.    These  predictions  were  then  used  to  predict  the  weekly 
cycle  of  concentration  levels  at  the  Atlanta  Water  Works  intake.    The  model  also 
predicted  that  TBEP  is  the  most  susceptible  to  natural  attenuation  processes  and  that 

- 3 - 


sorption  to  settling  solids  and  biodegradation  are  the  most  likely  processes  to  reduce 
TBEP concentrations.  TCEP was shown to be the most resistant to natural attenuation. 

Mr.  Lin  focused  on  drinking  water  treatment  processes,  and  whether  or  not  these 
processes  were  effective  in  removing  the  phosphate  triesters.  Specifically,  he  took 
samples  after  major  processes  at  the  Chattahoochee  Water  Treatment  Plant  in  Atlanta, 
GA. His  findings  suggested  that  removal  of  the  phosphate  triesters might  occur  after  the 
pre-treatment  chemical  addition  of  sodium  hypochlorite.  In  addition,  large  amounts  of 
TCEP  were  detected  after  the  filtration  and  post-treatment  chemical  addition  stage. 
Contamination  from  the  plant  itself  was  the  chief  potential  reason  for  the  addition  of 
TCEP. 

Mr.  Machairas  focused  on  the  issue  of  how  to  remove  phosphate  esters  from  drinking 
water.  From  the  various  treatment  processes  available,  the  oxidation  of  phosphate  esters 
through hydroxyl radical generated by the UV/H2O2 process applied at a UV disinfection 
unit was selected for evaluation. 
The  second-order 
two  phosphate  esters, 
reactions  of 
the 
rate  constants  of 
Tri(2-butoxyethyl)  phosphate  (TBEP)  and  Tri-2-chloroethyl  phosphate  (TCEP)  ,  with 
hydroxyl  radical  were  estimated  from  our  experimental  data  to  be  2·1010 
M-1  -1 
and
s
P 
P 
2·109  M s   respectively  A  comprehensive  kinetic  model  of  the  oxidation  process  was 
-1  -1 
P 
P 
derived. Finally computer simulations were used  to exhibit  the potential of  this  treatment 
process  and  to  examine  the  effects  of  pH,  total  carbonate  species  concentration,  initial 
hydrogen peroxide dose, and light intensity on its efficiency. 
The  results  are  not  very  encouraging  when  a  UV  unit  designed  for  disinfection  is  used. 
For typical values of pH and total carbonate species (pH=8 and CT=5·10-4 M) the 1  order
st 
P

rate  coefficients  for  removal  of  the  phosphate  esters  are  6.3·10-4  (s )  for  TBEP  and

If  higher  light  intensity  is  applied  in  the  reactor  (50  times  higher),  and  initial  hydrogen

become 2.9·10-2  (s ) and 2.9·10-3  (s ) for TBEP and TCEP respectively.

2  Background Information 

2.1  September 2003 Presentation 
In  September  2003,  Peter  Shanahan  made  a  presentation  concerning  PPCPs  in  the 
environment. This presentation focused on two specific studies conducted by the USGS.  

2.1.1  New Jersey Study 

Figure 2-1 Sampling sites investigated in Stackelberg and Lippincott (undated). 

The first of two studies examined was a joint study conducted by the USGS and the New 
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection  (Stackelberg and Lippincott, undated).  It 
focused  on  the  state  of  New  Jersey  where  samples  were  taken  from  treated  municipal 
sewage  discharging  to  river  systems..  Error!  Reference  source  not  found.  shows  the 
sampling  locations.  Ninety  percent  of  samples  tested  positive  for  at  least  one  of  the

OWCs  being  screened  for.  In  addition,  all  types  of  PPCPs  were  present,  with  varying 
concentrations (Figure 2-2Error! Reference source not found.). 

Figure 2-2 Average, minimum, maximum, 25th percentile and 75 percentile concentrations found in 
Stackelberg and Lippincott (undated). 

2.1.2  Summary of Previous USGS Studies Done on the Chattahoochee River Basin 

Second,  Frick  and  Zaugg  (2003)  compiled  data  of  OWCs  measured  in  Kolpin  et  al. 
(2002),  Frick  et  al.  (2001),  and  Henderson  et  al.  (2001),  and  Gregory  and  Frick  (2001). 
All data focused on the Chattahoochee River basin (Error! Reference source not found.). 

- 7 - 


Figure 2-3 Sampling sites from Frick and Zaugg (2003). 25 of 26 sampling sites were in the upper 
Chattahoochee River basin. 
All of the sampling was conducted between 1999 and 2002. Sampling was done along the 
river, in tributaries of the river, at WWTP intakes and effluents, and at DWTP intakes and 
effluents. 

2.1.2.1  Description of Frick et al. (2001) and Henderson et al. (2001) 

Study  3  from  Figure  2  comprises  the  sampling  sites  taken  in  Frick  et  al.  (2001)  and 
Henderson  et  al.  (2001).  These  studies  were  done  simultaneously,  and  were  jointly 
sponsored  by  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  (CDC)  and  the  USGS.  Sampling methods 
were  the  same as Kolpin et al.  (2002), and all  sampling was completed  in  the  summer of 
1999. The findings were quite similar to Stackelberg and Lippincott (undated) and Kolpin 
et al., where detectable concentrations of many OWCs were found in most sampling sites. 
Every  type  of  OWC  (e.g.  detergents,  plasticizers,  pharmaceuticals,  etc.)  had  similar 
detection frequencies, and were found at levels ranging from 10 to 2000 parts per trillion. 
Numbers  of  some  of  the  detections  are  in  the  next  sections.  In  addition,  the  specific 
sampling  times,  sampling  points,  and  concentrations  measured  at  each  site  were  also 
available from the authors.

2.1.3  The Formation of the Drugstore Cowboys 

The  proposal  presented  by  Dr.  Shanahan  was  to  get  an  engineer’s  view  of  the  survey 
done  in  Atlanta,  as  described  in  the  previous  section.  Through  Alden  Henderson,  who 
was one of the people in charge of the Chattahoochee River study, Dr. Shanahan obtained 
the  full data of  the  samples and  its  subsequent concentrations of PPCPs. Four Masters of 
Engineering students at MIT, Matthew Andrews, Samuel Haffey, Alexandros Machairas, 
and  Joseph  C.  Lin,  made  a  request  for  proposal  on  this  project.  Advising  them  in  the 
proposal  was  Peter  Shanahan,  Prof.  Phil  Gschwend,  Prof.  Tina  Voelker,  and  Dr.  John 
Macfarlane, who are all current  faculty  at MIT. The  four group members  also picked  the 
name Drugstore Cowboys, Inc., for their project name. 

The resumes of the four primary engineers are attached in the Appendix. 

2.2  Focusing on a Location to Do Field Work 

After  determining  that  more  work  must  be  done  than  just  interpreting  the  USGS/CDC 
data, the group decided that they needed a location to focus their work on. Some location 
ideas  presented  were  the  Assabet  River  in Massachusetts,  the  Chattahoochee  River,  and 
surface waters  in  Switzerland. The  group  chose  to  focus  on  the Chattahoochee River  for 
the following reasons: 

- All the work would be a good supplement to already-collected data. 
- Because of time constraints, choosing multiple areas to conduct field research 
would not be possible. 
Peter Shanahan had connections in Atlanta that would be useful in obtaining 
more information about the area, such as Alden Henderson and Daniele 
Lantagne, a former MIT Masters of Engineering student who now works at 
the CDC.

2.3  The Selected Family of Chemical Compounds – Organophosphate Triesters 

The  three  chemicals  picked  for  the  study  reported  in  this  thesis  were  tributyl  phosphate 
(TBP),  tri(2-chloroethyl)  phosphate  (TCEP),  and  tri(2-butoxyethyl)  phosphate  (TBEP). 
These chemicals were chosen because: 

- Due to time constraints of this group project, multiple families could not be 
chosen. 
- These three organophosphates were frequently detected in previous USGS 
studies. From Stackelberg and Lippincott (undated), TCEP was detected in 
50% of all samples, and TBEP was in 38%. Within the WWTP intake water, 
TCEP were detected in 12 of 12 samples, and TBP and TBEP was detected in 
10 of 12 samples. From Kolpin et al. (2002), TCEP was detected in 57.6% of 
85 samples, and TBEP was detected in 45.9% of 85 samples. From Frick and 
Zaugg (2003), TCEP and TBP were detected in 100% of 13 WWTP effluent 
samples and TBEP was detected in 38% of the 13 samples.. In addition, for 
the DWTP samples taken in Frick and Zaugg, the percentage of detections for 
all three phosphate triesters actually increased from raw water to finished 
water! (Table 1) 
- The three chemicals have similar structure. This study focuses only on 
phosphate triesters. A phosphate triester is comprised of a phosphorus atom, 
with four oxygen atoms bonded to the atom: one doubly-bonded, and the other 
three singly-bonded. Each of the three singly-bonded oxygen atoms has an 
organic group attached to it. Specifically, the phosphate triesters studied in 
this paper are phosphotriesters, where the functional group is identical for 
each three oxygen atoms.  
- The chemicals are widely used as flame-retardants, plasticizers, in floor 
polishes, and for many other purposes. Thus, there was good reason to believe 
that these compounds will be in the Chattahoochee River when the sampling 
was done in January 2004.

Organophosphate  flame-retardants  represent  20%  of  worldwide  production  of  flame-
retardants  (World  Health  Organization,  1997). When  the  flame-retardants  are  put  into  a 
fire,  they  break  down  into  phosphoric  acid  and  other  components  upon  heating.  The 
resulting  phosphoric  acid  forms  a  char  on  the  burning  surface,  resulting  in  less  surface 
area  available  as  fuel;  this  acid  also  reduces  the  release  of  volatiles.  Both  of  these 
phenomena reduce the intensity of the flame. 

The problem with these flame-retardants is not when they are used, but when they are not 
used.  For  example,  the  organophosphates  may  be  in  very  small  concentrations  in  a 
person’s clothing. Through washing of  the clothes,  the organophosphates go  into a waste 
stream,  thus  starting  the possible  chemical  transport  into  the  environment. Other uses,  as 
described  in  the  following  sections,  also  cause  the  phosphate  triesters  to  get  into  the 
environment. 

2.3.2  Tributyl Phosphate 
TBP has an n-butyl group attached to each of the single-bonded oxygen atoms.  

- 11 -

Figure 2-4 Chemical Structure of TBP. 
Some  of  the  important  chemical  properties  are  (Syracuse  Research  Corporation  (2003), 
Risk Assessment Information System (2004), and World Health Organization (2001): 

- Liquid at room temperature, miscible with water and chloroform. 
- Boiling point: 289 °C. Melting point: -79 °C. 
- Log Kow = 4. 
- Koc = 1900 L/kg. 
-
Solubility in water at 20 °C: 280 mg/L 
- Henry’s Law constant: 6.13 x 10-6  (dimensionless) 
- Density: 0.973 – 0.983 mg/L at 25 °C 
- Vapor pressure: 0.00349 mm Hg 20 °C 

TBP  is made  through  the  reaction  of  phosphorus  oxychloride  (POCl3)  and  butyl  alcohol
(World Health Organization, 1991). There  is  little  information on  the production of TBP. 
The  Environmental  Protection  Agency  requires  any  company  producing  at  least  10,000 
pounds  of  a  chemical  to  report  to  them  through  the  Inventory Update  Rule  (IUR).  From 
the 2002  IUR,  the production of TBP  in  the United States was between 1  and 10 million 
pounds.  Three  companies  (Akzo  Nobel  Functional  Chemicals,  LLC;  Ferro  Corporation; 
Great  Lakes  Chemical  Corp.)  produced  at  least  10,000  pounds  of  TBP  that  year  (US 
EPA, 2002). Chemical Sources International, Inc. (2004) lists 21 companies in the United 
States  that produce TBP, but only Akzo Nobel was  listed  in  this website among  the  three

companies that produced more than 10,000 pounds in 2002. Thus, the production volume 
within the United States may be significantly more than the reported volume. 

The  major  use  (forty  to  sixty  percent)  of  TBP  is  in  fire  resistant  hydraulic  fluid  for 
aircraft. (World Health Organization, 1991) 

The  second most prevalent use of TBP  is  as  a plasticizer  for plastics  and vinyl  resins.    It 
is  a  preferred  plasticizer  due  to  its  dual  capability  as  a  plasticizer  and  flame  retardant  in 
plastics. 

An  interesting,  emerging  use  of  TBP  is  in  the  recovery  of  uranium  ores  from  reactor 
products.  This  use  of  TBP  has  become  increasingly  significant  in  recent  years  (Thomas 
et al., 1998; World Health Organization, 1991). 

The estimated oral lethal dose of TBP is between one ounce and one pint for a 150 pound 
person.  Most  direct  encounters with  significant  quantities  of  TBP  occur  through  dermal 
contact  by  airline  mechanics  or  workers  in  TBP  production  plants.    Skin  irritation  is 
reported  in most  cases  and  headaches  and  dizziness  have  been  reported  due  to  exposure 
to TBP vapor (National Library of Medicine, 2004). 

Although  there  have  been  no  fatal  effects  to  humans,  animals  with  TBP  in  their  system 
have  displayed  neurological  effects  such  as  weakness  and  dyspnea  (difficulty  in 
breathing).  TBP’s  most  dramatic  effects  are  to  plant  life.    TBP  has  been  shown  to 
increase  the  drying  rate  of  leaves  and  plants  exposed  to  TBP  stopped  respiring  (World 
Health Organization, 1991). 

2.3.3  Tri(2-butoxyethyl) Phosphate 

TBEP  has  a  2-butoxyethyl  group  attached  to  the  single-bonded  oxygen  atoms  (Error! 
Reference source not found.). 

- 13 - 


Figure 2-5 Chemical Structure of TBEP. 

Major chemical properties: 

- Liquid at room temperature, miscible with water and chloroform. 
- Boiling point: 200-230 °C. Melting point: -70 °C. 
- Log Kow = 4.38. 
- Koc = 24000. 

-
Solubility in water at 20 °C: 1100-1300 mg/L.  

- Henry’s law constant: 1.20 x 10-6  (dimensionless). 
- Density: 1.02 mg/L at 20 °C. 
- Vapor pressure: 2.8 x 10-8  mm Hg at 20 °C 

TBEP  is  made  through  the  reaction  of  phosphorus  oxychloride  with  butoxyethanol 
(World  Health  Organization,  2000).  The  World  Health  Organization  estimated 
production  to  be  between 11-13 million pounds, but no year was  cited.  In  the 2002  IUR, 
the  production  volume  was  10-50  million  pounds,  reported  by  two  companies  (Akzo 
Nobel  and  Great  Lakes  Chemical).  The  1994  and  1998  IUR  also  report  a  10-50  million 
pound  range  (US EPA, 2002). This  range  is  larger  than  the 1-10 million pound  range  for

TBP  and  TCEP;  therefore,  the  loading  into  the  surface water  environment may  be much 
larger than the loadings for TBP and TCEP 

The  most  likely  pathway  TBEP  takes  into  the  wastewater  system  is  through  its  use  in 
floor  polishes  (NIH,  2003).  TBEP  adds  elasticity  and  gloss  to  floor  polishes.  The 
increased  elasticity  increases  the  leveling  and  spreading  properties  of  the  polish.    It  is  a 
component of  several household  floor polishes,  including such  familiar names as Mop & 
Glo  and  Brilliance,  in  concentrations  as  high  as  eight  percent.    Disposal  of  wastewater 
after floor polishing is an obvious pathway to municipal wastewater systems.  

TBEP is also used as an antifoam agent and solvent for complex organic compounds such 
as  resins,  waxes,  poly  acrylites,  and  acrylic  co-polymers.  (World  Health  Organization, 
2000) 

TBEP  was  found  to  be  a  mild  skin  irritant  (National  Library  of  Medicine,  2004). 
Significant  testing  has  been  done  to  determine  its  non-human  toxicity.    Among  other 
effects  it has been  found  to  reduce  the production of  red blood cells  in  rats and chickens. 
(World Health Organization, 2000) 

2.3.4  Tri-(2-chloroethyl) Phosphate 

TCEP  has  a  2-chloroethyl  group  attached  to  each  of  the  single-bonded  oxygen  atoms. 
TCEP  has  different  chemical  properties  because  of  the  chlorine  atom  end  group,  as 
shown in Error! Reference source not found..

TCEP  is  made  through  the  reaction  of  phosphorus  oxychloride  and  ethylene  oxide, 
followed  by  subsequent  purification  (World  Health  Organization,  1998).  Brown  et  al. 
(1975)  indicated  that  the United States produced 29.4 million pounds and consumed 25.5 
million  pounds  of  TCEP.  Twelve  million  of  the  25.5  million  consumed  was  used  as  a 
flame retardant, and  the other 13.5 million was used  in synthetic  lubricants and hydraulic 
fluids.  In  1997,  the  estimated  demand was  9 million  pounds,  a  significant  decline  in  use 
compared  to Brown et al.  In  the 2002  IUR, TCEP production  in  the United States was 1 ­
10  million  pounds.  This  production  volume  is  based  on  the  reports  of  two  companies, 
Akzo  Nobel  and  Great  Lakes  Chemical  (US  EPA,  2002).  TCEP  is  also  used  as  a 
plasticizer in PVC and resins.

TCEP is known to be a carcinogen (recognized in 1992 by California through Proposition 
65  (2004)),  and  is  suspected  to be  a  reproductive, kidney,  and  liver  toxicant. The  current 
chronic dermal RfD is 0.15 mg/kg-day. 

TCEP  has  several  uses  that  provide  ready  pathways  into  the  municipal  wastewater 
stream.    TCEP  is  used  as  fire  retardant  in  liquid  unsaturated  polyester  resins  (World 
Health  Organization,  1998).  The  normal  concentration  is  five  to  two  percent  in  these 
resins.  (Jiangdu Dajian Chemical  Factory web  site)  The  resins  are  used  in  the  casting  of 
bathtubs, spas, and pipes.  It is possible that leaching from these surfaces could provide a 
pathway into the environment. 

An  even more  likely pathway  into  the  environment  is  the use of TCEP  as  a back  coating 
for  textiles  used  in  furniture  and  protective  clothing.   Maintenance  and  cleaning  of  these 
products  and  subsequent  disposal  of  the  wastewater  used  in  the  process  could  provide  a 
pathway to the WWTP (World Health Organization, 1998) 

In  tests  regarding  bioconcentration, TCEP was  found  to  accumulate  in  the  brains  of  rats, 
and  with  repeated  exposure  was  found  to  have  adverse  effects  on  the  brain,  liver,  and 
kidneys.  It  is  also  known  to  adversely  affect  the  reproduction  rates  of  rats  and  mice

3  Natural Attenuation 

An  exploration  into  the  fate  and  transport  of  these  three  phosphate  triesters  is  an 
important  component  of  an  overall  assessment  of  the Chattahoochee River.    Few  studies 
have  explored  the  natural  removal  of  organophosphate  triesters  in  surface  waters  (Fries 
and  Puttman,  2001, Kawagoshi  et  al.,  2002).    The  goal  of  this  study was  to  determine  if 
natural  attenuation  of  these  compounds  exists within  the Chattahoochee River.    Samples 
were  collected  at  four  sites  along  the  Chattahoochee  and  analyzed  for  the  presence  of 
each phosphate triester.  Coupling these concentrations with flow rate along the river and 
source inputs from several sewage treatment plants (STPs) on the Chattahoochee, several 
mass  balances  were  completed.    The  intent  was  to  reveal  a)  whether  significant  sinks 
exist and b) which portions of the river are likely to contain a phosphate triester sink. 

Upon  consideration  of  the  physical  and  chemical  properties  of  these  compounds,  the 
Drugstore  Cowboys  reasoned  that  biodegradation  was  a  likely  removal  mechanism  over 
the time period of flow down the Chattahoochee (Drugstore Cowboys, 2003).  To test for 
the presence of biodegradation, a second set of samples was collected and incubated prior 
to  analysis  at  various  times  over  a  24-hr  period.    These  results  were  then  analyzed  in 
order to obtain a decay rate for each compound.   

In this chapter a brief explanation of the sampling and analysis methods will be presented 
(refer to Andrews (2004) for a detailed description).  Results will be then be reported and 
discussed, drawing conclusions regarding natural attenuation in the Chattahoochee as 
well as identifying potential follow-up studies.   

3.1  Experiment Summary 

In  order  to  facilitate  a  comparison  of  results,  the  same  50-mile  stretch  of  the 
Chattahoochee used during the USGS surveys was implemented in determining sampling 
sites for this study.  Four locations along this stretch were chosen for sampling, beginning 
at Buford Dam and ending downstream of the Atlanta Water Treatment Plant

Figure 3-1: Chattahoochee River Sampling Sites 

in northwest Atlanta.  Two intermediate sampling sites were chosen, one behind the 
Morgan Falls Dam in Bull Sluice Lake and another located further upstream near the 
town of Roswell (Figure 3-1).  The specific sampling locations were chosen based on 
accessibility to the river and a desire to sample downstream of STP outfalls.  The goal 
was to be far enough downstream of the outfalls that it can be reasonably assumed that 
the phosphate triesters were well mixed within the river and no attention need be paid to 
transverse concentration variations.

The sampling sites divide the 50-mile stretch into three sections, Buford Dam to Roswell, 
Roswell to Morgan Falls, and Morgan Falls to Atlanta, each containing two STP sources. 
The  sites  serve  as  end  points  for  three  separate  mass  balances  on  the  river.    Combining 
the  concentrations measured  at  each  site with  flow  rate data  for  the Chattahoochee River 
yields  input  and  output mass  rates  for  each mass  balance.   By  combining  concentrations 
from  the  STPs  discharges  (Frick  and  Zaugg,  2003)  with  their  typical  effluent  flow  rates 
(Haffey,  2004),  the  source  term  for  each  mass  balance  can  be  constructed.    Although 
other  sources  of  phosphate  triesters  exist  (e.g.  atmospheric  deposition,  groundwater 
infiltration,  land  runoff)  it  is  assumed  that  these  inputs  are  negligible  compared  to  STP 
effluent.  The  only  remaining  variable  is  the  sink  term,  which  is  a  simple  mathematical 
exercise  to  evaluate.    A  positive  sink  term  indicates  the  likely  presence  of  removal 
mechanism within the river.  

During the second experiment, two separate sets of samples were collected at each site in 
order  to  specifically  target  biodegradation  as  a  removal  process.    These  samples  were 
stored in a water bath full of river water for either 5 or 24 hours, allowing biodegradation 
to  proceed.    At  the  allotted  time  following  collection  from  the  river,  the  samples  were 
removed  from  the  bath  and  analyzed  for  phosphate  triester  content.    Coupling  these 
results  with  the  samples  collected  for  the  mass  balance  (0-hour),  phosphate  triester 
concentration was  analyzed with  respect  to  time, yielding  a biodegradation  removal  rate. 
Triplicates  of  each  sample were  collected  for  a  total  of  nine  at  each  site.   The  reason  for 
additional  samples  was  to  increase  the  likelihood  of  reliable  results  and  allow  for  the 
prospect of ruined samples. 

Every  river  sample  was  tested  for  phosphate  triester  content  through  a  combination  of 
liquid-liquid extraction and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).   A  total of 
400  mL  of  chloroform  was  introduced  to  each  3.8-L  river  sample,  extracting  the 
phosphate  triesters  from  the  water.    The  chloroform  was  allowed  to  settle,  then  pipetted 
out  of  the  river  sample.    The  volume  of  chloroform  was  then  reduced  through  roto-
evaporation  and  N2  blow-down  processes.  Once  the  samples  had  been  sufficiently

condensed, an injection standard was supplied just before analysis on a JEOL GC/MS.  A 
short  calculation,  utilizing  this  injection  standard,  converted  the  GC/MS  signal  to  the 
original  river  concentration.  For  a  more  detailed  description  of  the  sampling  procedure 
and lab analysis, refer to Andrews (2004). 

Data Analysis / Results 

3.1.1  Data Validation 

The  preliminary  component  of  the  data  analysis  was  to  validate  the  results  utilizing 
several  mechanisms.    The  analytical  methods  used  to  derive  the  data  were  validated 
through  a  comparison  with  blank  solutions,  standards  containing  a  known  quantity  of 
each  phosphate  triester,  and  a  comparison  to  other  data  extracted  from  the  same 
equipment.    The  lowest  concentration  standard  tested  was  500  µg/L  of  chloroform. 
Given  that  each  river  sample was  condensed  by  a  factor  of  approximately  40,000  (3.8  L 
reduced  to  0.1  mL)  the  concentration  of  500  µg/L  of  chloroform  in  the  GC  vial 
corresponds  to a river water sample of approximately 0.01 µg/L.   Therefore,  the best  that 
can  be  stated  with  assurance  is  that  the  detection  limit  of  the  GC/MS  is  0.01  µg/L,  or 
lower. 

Blank  solutions,  containing  only  chloroform  from  the  same  source  as  each  sample, were 
interwoven  into  sample  runs  in  order  to  check  for  interference  from  the  GC/MS.    At  no 
time  did  blank  solutions  yield  discernable  peaks  at  any  of  the  four  output  times,  an 
indication  that  the  chloroform  contributed  less  than  0.01  µg/L  of  phosphate  triesters 
(Figure  3-2).   This  is  relative  assurance  that  neither  the  chloroform  used  nor  the GC/MS 
supplied more than 0.01 µg/L to the results.

Figure 3-2: Blank chloroform GC/MS output 

An  inspection  of  previous work  performed  on  the  same GC/MS  equipment  revealed  that 
a  similar  count  per  mass  ratio  of  injection  standard  was  observed,  indicating  that  the 
equipment had remained relatively consistent.   

Data  published  from  the  USGS/CDC  study  was  used  to  give  a  sense  of  the  expected 
concentration and a degree of confirmation.   The  flow  in  the Chattahoochee  is extremely 
variable,  fluctuating  by  as  much  as  a  factor  of  ten  on  a  particular  day.    Therefore, 
depending  on  the  precise  time  that  samples  were  taken  by  the  USGS,  results  may  vary 
from  the  results  of  this  study  due  to  dilution  [Haffey,  2004,  USGS  Real-Time,  2004). 
Differences  in  sampling  and  analysis  procedure  could  also  lead  to  variations  in  results. 
An  order  of  magnitude  difference,  therefore,  is  deemed  sufficient  for  an  agreeable 
comparison of the two studies.   

As  mentioned  previously,  the  USGS/CDC  study  detected  these  three  phosphate  triesters 
at  concentrations  typically  observed  throughout  the  world  (Fries  and  Puttman,  2001, 
Frick and Zaugg, 2003).   The only samples  representative of  the Chattahoochee River by 
the  USGS/CDC  were  the  three  drinking  water  intakes.    Fortunately,  these  sites  align 
reasonably  well  with  the  Roswell, Morgan  Falls,  and  Atlanta  sampling  sites,  allowing  a 
comparison  to  be  made  (Figure  3-3).  However,  no  detections  were  observed  for  TBP  at 
the any of the drinking water intakes.  Because the USGS/CDC’s detection limit was 0.06 
µg/L, concentrations were at least below this threshold.  For general comparison purposes
