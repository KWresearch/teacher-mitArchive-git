Introduction 
Clean  Water  for  Nepal  (CWN)  is  excited  to  be  teaming  up  with  the  Environment  and 
Public Health Organization  (ENPHO),  among  a  host  of  other  colleagues,  to  help  deliver 
solutions  to  the  pressing  water  and  wastewater  issues  that  face  Nepal.  We  have  been 
asked  to complete seven projects:  four  related  to water and  three  related  to wastewater. 
The four related to water are the subject of this report as follows: 
1.  Biosand Filter 
2.  Ceramic Water Filters 
3.  Semi Continuous Solar Disinfection 
4.  Arsenic Technologies 

 
Many of  these projects continue  the work done by past MIT Nepal Teams; some  involve 
new  approaches  that  have  yet  to  be  investigated  in  the  four  years  that  MIT  has  been 
working  in Nepal.  This  proposal  outlines  both  our  intended  plan  of  action  and  proposed 
deliverables  as  per  the  requirements  defined  in  the  initial  Request  for  Proposal  and 
refined since then through weekly group meetings at MIT.  
CWN  is committed  to sustainability and specifically,  to  the goal of contributing  to human 
and ecosystem well being both now and  into the future. We seek solutions that meet the 
needs  of  our  clients  as  well  as  those  of  society  and  the  environment;  recognizing  the 
essential  interdependencies  that  exist  between  people  and  the  environment.  While  our 
skills  are  strongly  rooted  in  technology  and  engineering,  we  are  keenly  aware  of  how 
vital  it  is  to  ensure  that  our  designs  are  practical  and  that  they meet  the  needs  of  those 
who will ultimately be making use of them.  
The first part of this proposal presents some facts concerning global water and sanitation 
problems  to  highlight  the  relevance  of  our  projects  not  only  in  Nepal  but  from  a  global 
perspective  as  well.  The  second  and  main  part  of  the  proposal,  Chapters  2  and  3, 
summarize the seven proposed projects. 
1.1  Nepal 
The Kingdom of Nepal  is  located on  the  southern  slopes of  the Himalayan Mountains  in 
South Central Asia  (Figure 1).  It  is bound by China  to  the north and surrounded by  India 
to  the  east,  west  and  south.    The  total  land  area,  approximately  145,391  km2  (5,6136 
mi2)  in  size,  is  comprised  of  three  major  topographical  regions:  the  Mountains  of  the 
main Himalayan Range,  the Hills  or  Katmandu  Valley,  and  the  Terai, which  is  a  narrow 
flat  belt  of  alluvial  land  that  extends  along  the  southern  border  with  India.  The  total 
estimated population is 23.6 million people (WHO/UNICEF, 2000).

The climate in Nepal ranges from sub-tropic summers to mild winters in the southern 
lowlands and cool summers to severe winters in the higher alpine and mountain regions. 
The average annual precipitation decreases from 1,778 mm (70 inches) in the east to 
899 mm (35 inches) in the west. Average temperature ranges in Kathmandu are from 2 
to 20 degrees Celsius (36 to 73 degrees Fahrenheit) in January to 20 to 29 degrees 
Celsius (68 to 84 degrees Fahrenheit) in July. 

 

 
The Gross National Income for Nepal is $5.9 billion, representing approximately $250 
income per capita (World Bank Data, 2001). 81% of the total population is reported to 
have access to improved water sources and 75% of the urban population has access to 
proper sanitation. Note that only 12.2% of the total population is urban and the rural 
population has access to improved water supply and sanitation services. The lack of 
clean water and proper sanitation has led to many health problems that are related in 
one way or another to a relatively high infant mortality rate (104.7 per 1000 die before 
the age of 5) and short life expectancy (58.9 years). It has been reported that some of 
the most chronic widespread and chronic health problems are due to waterborne 
diseases such as intestinal parasites, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal disorders (Matles, 
1991)i. Other factors that may influence these numbers are poor nutrition and sanitation, 
the general absence of medical care and other social services which are particularly 
necessary in rural areas. 
Some of the main environmental issues that Nepal faces include deforestation due to the 
overuse of wood for fuel; water contamination, mainly due to human and animal wastes, 
agricultural runoff, and industrial effluents; wildlife conservation; and vehicular 
emissionsi.

1.2  MIT Nepal Water Project  
The MIT Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) has been working in 
Nepal since 1999 to help provide clean drinking water and improved sanitation to those 
in need. Our projects have evolved from monitoring and assessing water quality at 
project sites to researching, testing, and developing low-cost point-of-use household 
water treatment technologies.  
1.3  Project Schedule  
Clean Water for Nepal divided the proposed project work in three phases. The first 
phase consisted on the work done during the Fall Semester at MIT. The second phase 
consisted of a field research phase in different study regions in Nepal. The third and final 
phase consisted in the synthesis of the first and second phases, results and conclusions.  

1.3.1  Phase 1 
Clean Water for Nepal Inc. was assembled in the beginning of Fall Semester of 2002. At 
this stage, the planning phase of the project, letter of intent, and proposal were 
presented. During this phase, the team met every Friday to discuss different issues 
concerning the proposed work, such as: water, political economical and social situations 
in Nepal, advances of each one of the team members in their specific study field, study 
of field testing and water quality parameters, and traveling issues.  

1.3.2  Phase 2 
Clean Water for Nepal Inc. traveled to Kathmandu, Nepal during the first week of 
January. Each member of the Clean Water for Nepal, Inc. was then situated in a 
geographical region based on the specific field study needs, and in order to have a 
broader view and understanding of the water situation in Nepal. From then on, the 
following three weeks of January, the team members were engaged on a full-time basis 
in the collection of field data needed for the completion of the investigation and proposed 
project. Clean Water for Nepal rejoined in the city of Kathmandu at the end of the month 
and presented to our local partners, Environmental and Public Health Organization 
(ENPHO, an environmental laboratory and research institute) some preliminary results 
based on field data collected. Clean Water for Nepal returned to its headquarters at MIT 
February 3rd 2003. 

1.3.3  Phase 3 
Back at MIT, Clean Water for Nepal synthesized bibliographic and laboratory research 
with field data collected during January in Nepal. Final results and conclusions were 
obtained and presented in an oral presentation on April 18th 2003 and the present final 
group report was made.

2  Water Projects 
2.1  Global Need for Clean Drinking Water 
Water is essential for life: both in terms of quantity and quality. As of the year 2000, one 
sixth of the world’s population, roughly 1.1 billion people, lacked access to improved 
water supply, and two fifths, or 2.4 billion people, lacked access to improved sanitation. 
Every year, approximately 3.4 million people die due to water-related diseases with the 
majority being young children under the age of five. Diarrheal diseases alone account for 
2.1 million deaths per year. Other types of diseases associated with poor water quality 
include cholera, typhoid, arsenic poisoning, schistosomiasis or “snail fever”, and 
trachoma, which causes blindness. The risks of contacting these diseases can be 
considerably minimized with access to clean drinking water, adequate sanitation 
facilities, and proper hygiene practices.  
The link between health, water quality and water quantity is an important relationship 
that was intuitively understood by ancient civilizations as indicated in this Sanskrit quote 
from the second millennium B.C.:  
“it is directed to heat foul water by boiling and exposing to sunlight and by dipping 
a piece of hot copper into water seven times, then to filter and cool in an earthen 
vessel.”  
It was not until the mid 1800’s that people began to fully understand the scientific link 
between water quality and health. Epidemiologist Dr. John Snow proved in 1855 that a 
cholera epidemic in London was attributed to a public well contaminated by sewage. The 
germ theory of disease later emerged from Louis Pasteur’s research into fermentation. 
Soon chlorine was being used as a disinfectant in water supply systems to kill potential 
pathogens or microorganisms that cause disease and illness. Industrialized countries 
moved forward with the development of rather large centralized water supply and 
treatment systems, which, to this date, have performed relatively well in comparison to 
the water supply systems that exist in many developing countries.  
So why not transfer the technology and knowledge that exists in industrialized countries 
to developing countries to help solve the mounting water crisis? This may work in theory 
and in some specific cases, but in reality there are too many political, economic and 
geographic issues – not to mention issues of population increase – to realistically expect 
that the one billion plus who lack access to safe drinking water will receive clean potable 
water from a household tap by 2015 vis-à-vis the Millennium Development Goal for 
clean water.  
2.2  Regional Needs for Clean Drinking Water in Nepal 
Administratively, the country is divided into 5 development regions and 75 districts 
(Figure 2). The Department of Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) has representatives in 
each of these districts and is the government agency responsible for the development of 
rural water supply and sanitation services throughout the Kingdom. Other government 
agencies active in water supply and sanitation projects include the Nepal Water Supply 
Corporation (NWSC), District Development Committees and Village Development 
Committees. In addition to these government agencies, there are many non-
governmental organizations working within Nepal including the Nepal Red Cross,

The population of Nepal as of 2001 was 23,592,000 with an annual growth rate of 2.4%. 
Approximately 88.2% of the population lives in rural villages and towns loosely scattered 
throughout the Hills and Terai regions. A 1991 survey of population density by district 
shows the highest population density in southeastern Terai (Figure 3). Population growth 
from 1981 to 1991 occurred mostly within the Terai region as well. (Figure 4) and this 
trend has likely continued through to the present time.

The United Nations Development Programme Human Development Index (HDI) for 
Nepal is 0.49, ranking Nepal 142nd out of 173 countries. The HDI is a composite index 
that is used to measure human development and to compare human development 
between countries.  
Nepal’s relatively poor ranking in comparison to the other 173 countries is reflected in 
the following statistics:  
58.6 years 
 
•  Life expectancy at birth  
•  GDP per capita ($PPP)1 
$1,224   
 
•  Literacy Rate2 
41.8% 
 
•  Population below income poverty line $2/day3 
82.5% 
•  Children under height for age4 
54% 
91/1000 
•  Child under-five mortality rate 
The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMD) has also 
developed their own set of 39 development indicators for Nepal and ranked the 75 
districts in order of the Composite Index of Development (1 being least developed and 
75 being most developed) (Figure 5).  The least developed districts, according to the 
ICIMD report, are located within the northwestern region of the country as well as some 
areas just east of Kathmandu.

According to the World Health Organization’s 2000 “Global Water Supply and Sanitation 
Assessment Report”, nearly five million people in Nepal lack access to safe drinking 
water and nearly eighteen million lack access to improved sanitation. The ICIMD also 
prepared a map showing the drinking water coverage by district based on information 
provided by the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (Figure 6). According to the 
map in, the eastern Hills districts have the worst coverage.  

 

Figure 6: Drinking Water Coverage 
Picture Source: ICIMOD (www.icimod-gis.net) 

When visiting and talking with many individuals and organizations in Nepal, however, it 
is readily apparent that more than five million people are vulnerable to problems with 
drinking water quality since the majority lack access to adequately treated water. There 
is virtually no monitoring of rural water supplies and the integrity of the urban systems in 
places like Kathmandu is often questioned by the general public and media. In May of 
1995, for example, ENPHO found that 39 of 42 drinking water samples taken from the 
Kathmandu municipal water supply system were contaminated with fecal coliform 
bacteria and that 98% of the samples had no free residual chlorine. A more recent 
sample taken from a tap on the roof of ENPHO, supplied by the municipality, in January 
2003 showed a total coliform concentration of 1550 cfu/100 mL. This sample was, 
however, taken the day after the water storage tank on the roof had been filled – the day 
previous to refilling the tank showed a total coliform concentration of 3 cfu/100mL. 
Nevertheless, this demonstrates some of the problems associated with the municipal 
water supply system as a whole – even if the water coming directly from the municipal 
system is clean, many citizens use storage tanks to store this water and these tanks in 
turn add another level of risk of water contamination.   
Essentially, the infrastructure for supplying clean water across Nepal – both rural and 
urban areas – is minimal compared to that in industrialized countries, leaving citizens to

treat their own water if they realize the need to do so and can afford to. Most of the 
population relies on decentralized water supply systems such as tube wells, open wells, 
springs, and stone taps connected to local reservoirs. While some of these water 
sources may be relatively clean, many are not, and those that may be now are still quite 
vulnerable to contamination in the future as development proceeds and stress on the 
environment and water resources persists. Springs, as an example, are perceived by 
many to be a relatively clean source of water; however, a survey of the percentage 
distribution by mode of drinking water (piped water, handpump/tap, well, spring, and 
other) of children under five years of age with diarrhea showed that 23% of the cases 
originated from springs – the second highest percentage behind “other” at 24%, 
suggesting that springs are more vulnerable to contamination than is commonly 
perceived. A random test of two hitigah or dhungedhara5 wells used for both drinking 
water and cleaning in the Naikap district near Kathmandu in January 2003 showed total 
coliform concentrations of 1,660 and 2,130 cfu/100mL and E.coli concentrations of 5 and

2.3  Point-of-Use Household Water Treatment Technology  
In countries like Nepal, most people – predominately women – spend a portion of their day 
collecting, carrying and storing water for drinking. The water that ends up in the house does 
not originate from a typical water treatment plant and supply system, but comes to them from 
a variety of sources including local dug wells, tube wells, springs and stone taps (Figure 7). If 
the water is not already contaminated at the source, it often becomes contaminated at some 
point during transport and/or during handling storage before it is consumed.   
Considering the reality in many developing countries like Nepal, where individuals are 
responsible for ensuring they have safe drinking water, it seems reasonable to focus on 
household water treatment technology as a means to providing clean drinking water. In fact, 
household water treatment appears to be gaining recognition within international 
development organizations such as the World Health Organization which recently published 
a report on Managing Water in the Home and UNICEF which sponsored an online virtual 
forum on Household Water Security in cooperation with WHO and the Network for Cost-
effective Technologies in Water Supply and Sanitation (HTN).  A recent statement issued by 
the United Nations Committee on Economic, Cultural, and Social Rights goes one step 
further by declaring water as a human right6, which, taken into the context of the Millennium 
Development Goal, puts pressure on governments to live up to their commitment to halve the 
number of people without access to improved water supply and sanitation services by the 
year 2015.

2.4  BioSand Filtration 
Project Coordinator: Melanie Pincus 

 

 

2.4.1  BioSand Filtration Overview 
The BioSand Filter is an intermittently operated slow sand filter specifically designed for use 
by poor people in developing countries.  Developed by Dr. David Manz of the University of 
Calgary, Alberta, the BioSand filter (see Figure 8) is a scaled-down version of a municipal 
slow sand filter, and optimized for intermittent, household use (as opposed to continuous, 
community-scale use).   
BioSand filter design incorporates two key modifications to traditional slow sand filtration 
technology.  The first is a faster loading rate of 0.6 m/hr (flow rate of 20-40 L/hr for a 0.3 m x 
0.3 m concrete unit) as compared to traditional slow sand filtration loading rates of 0.1 to 0.2 
m/hr.  The second key design parameter is a 5 cm layer of standing water, sufficient to allow 
adequate oxygen diffusion to the biological layer during pause periods7 (0.7 – 1.5 m for 
traditional slow sand filters; AWWARF, 1991). 
 

 
Figure 8: Cross-section of a concrete BioSand filter (Ritenour, 1998) 

 
2.4.2  Particle Removal Mechanisms 
Predation by protozoa in the supernatant (standing water layer) as well as the biofilm has 
been identified as the principle biological removal mechanism of harmful bacteria in source 

                                                 
7 Dr. Manz’s patent is for a “Slow Sand Filter for use with Intermittently Flowing Water Supply and Method of use 
thereof.” Supernatant depth is specified at 1 – 8 cm above the top of the surface sand layer (Manz, 1993).

water.8  Physical-chemical removal processes include straining (of particles greater than 
about 2 µm in diameter) and attachment via intermolecular forces between the sand grain 
surfaces and dissolved and/or suspended particles. 
2.4.3  Biofilm Maturation 
Newly installed or recently cleaned BioSand filters do not effectively remove bacteria.  
Bacterial removal efficiency depends on biolayer "ripeness."  Ripening refers to the time 
necessary for the biological community or biofilm to mature such that optimal bacterial and 
particle removal is attained.  Specifically, filter ripening is defined in this context as an 
improvement in the ability of a filter to remove Escherichia coli (E. coli).  E. coli were chosen 
as test particles because they were not expected to multiply in the filter columns (due to low 
temperatures and insufficient oxygen levels) and thus could be used as tracer particles 
(Weber-Shirk and Dick, 1997).   
2.4.4  BioSand Filter Field Site and Methods 
The author traveled to the Lumbini district of Nepal’s southern Terai region to assess the 
technical performance of 10 recently installed concrete BioSand filters.  Filter performance 
and source water quality were evaluated using membrane filtration for enumeration of E. coli 
and total coliform bacteria, presence/absence tests for hydrogen sulfide (H2S) producing 
bacteria, turbidity and flow rate measurements.  E. Coli and H2S test results were compared 
to assess the validity of the H2S method for detecting fecal contamination in drinking water in 
colder climates (temperatures at or below 10oC [50oF]). 
Field and laboratory experiments on concrete CAWST (2003) and plastic Davnor (2003) 
BioSand filters (see Figure 9) were performed to elucidate biofilm maturation rates and 
bacterial removal efficiencies.

8 Weber-Shirk and Dick (1997) studied particle and E. coli removal mechanisms in slow sand filters.  Introduction 
of sodium azide (an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation) was found to cause appreciable reduction in particle 
and E. coli removal, indicating biological removal mechanisms to be significant.  Bacterivory was identified as 
the biological mechanism principally responsible for bacteria removal.

The BioSand pitcher filter (see Figure 10) was conceptualized during field investigations as a 
smaller, cheaper alternative to the concrete BioSand filters.  Pitcher filters might also 
potentially serve as bench-scale models of the larger BioSand filters, or as backups to the 
full-size units during filter cleaning and subsequent biofilm re-maturation.

Field and laboratory experiments were performed to conduct a preliminary evaluation of 
pitcher filter viability by cross-checking their performance with the concurrent performance of 
concrete and plastic Davnor BioSand filters.   

2.4.5  Discussion of Results 

2.4.5.1  Lumbini Household BioSand Filter Survey 
Ten concrete BioSand filters in 6 villages were visited.  Filter flow rates varied from 1.0 to 
37.5 L/hr (see Table 1); improper sand preparation and filter commissioning for some units 
may be responsible for the variation observed.  Turbidity removal was high for all systems; 
filters treating highly turbid source water (ground water of 176.0 – 360.0 NTU) were observed 
to remove between 98.7 and 99.8% of turbidity.

Results from microbial analyses were mixed (see Table 2).  Whereas two BioSand filters 
were removing 99% of E. coli from highly contaminated influent water, three were found to be 
sources of E. coli contamination for relatively clean source water.

While field and laboratory experiments on full-size BioSand filters strongly suggest that fully 
ripened BioSand filters will significantly improve the quality of influent water, further testing of 
the Lumbini household filters is appropriate.  One day of testing for each filter, which was all 
the time afforded for that activity, is insufficient to adequately characterize BioSand filter 
performance.  Regular, repeated samplings of source water, filtered water and water in 
collection buckets still needs to be performed on these pilot household units.   
Sampling programs should also include consistent sterilization protocol.  For example, if 
users are suspected of introducing contamination at the source, triplicate water samples 
should be obtained (a) as collected by the users, (b) by a trained monitor or technician

at the point of withdrawal, e.g., after flaming the spout and collecting into a sterilized 
container (Carter, 2003). 

2.4.5.2  BioSand Filter Bacterial Removal Efficiencies 
Results from field and laboratory experiments on concrete and plastic BioSand filters support 
the use of this technology to provide households with safe drinking water.  Data suggest that 
fully ripened BioSand filters are capable of significantly improving the quality of influent 
water, reducing turbidity by at least 90% (to less than 5.0 NTU9) and influent E. coli 
concentrations by at least 95%.  In addition, a strong correlation was observed between 
biofilm maturation periods and source water quality; lower quality influent water (high 
turbidity, high levels of nutrients and bacteria, etc.) facilitated biofilm ripening (see Table 3).

2.4.5.3  Agreement between H2S and Membrane Filtration Test Results 
Very poor agreement (38% false negative rate) was observed between H2S and membrane 
filtration test results, even in samples with >1000 cfu E. coli/100 mL.  Winter temperatures of 
approximately 10oC (50oF) and lower (to approximately 4oC or 40oF) were thought to 
significantly decrease the accuracy of H2S tests as detectors of fecal contamination in 
drinking water.   
Even so, numerous studies have found good agreement between H2S tests and enumerative 
bacterial analyses under warmer conditions (see Ratto et al., 1989; Kromoredjo and Fujioka, 
1991; Kaspar et al., 1992; Castillo et al., 1994; Venkobachar et al., 1994; Martins et al., 
1997; Rijal and Fujioka, 1998; Genthe and Franck, 1999; Pillai et al., 1999; and Sullivan, 
2002), and many researchers recommend the H2S method as a reasonable approach for 
detecting fecal contamination in drinking water.   

                                                 
9 WHO guideline for turbidity in drinking water is less than or equal to 5.0 NTU (WHO, 2002a).

In addition, the tests may be ideal for facilitating community involvement in the monitoring 
and management of drinking water supplies and treatment systems because of their 
simplicity and ease of interpretation.  Because test results are based simply on the 
observable formation (or lack thereof) of a black precipitate, even poorly educated (e.g., 
illiterate) individuals may learn to successfully use and interpret the results of H2S analyses.   

2.4.5.4  BioSand Pitcher Filter Viability 
Comparable microbial and turbidity removal performance between pitcher filters and 
concrete CAWST and plastic Davnor filters support the use of a pitcher system testing 
platform to model the commercially available BioSand technology.  Pitcher filters might also 
be used as an interim measure until a household mobilizes funds for a larger capacity water 
filter (e.g., a concrete BioSand filter), or as backups to the full-size units during cleaning and 
subsequent biofilm re-maturation.   
Microbial removal performance of experimental pitcher filters was comparable to the existing 
BioSand filters.  E. coli removal efficiencies of two field pitcher filters (averaged over 3 days) 
were 80 and 86%, as compared to 81 and 87% for concrete BioSand filters.  Laboratory 
pitcher filters ripened with E. coli spiked Charles River water for 28 days, then challenged 
with dilute wastewater, showed removal efficiencies of 97%, as compared to 95% for a 
plastic BioSand filter (see Figure 11).

Limitations of the BioSand pitcher filter system also deserve consideration.  Due to its small 
size, the pitcher filter biofilm may be at a greater risk of disturbance (i.e., from jostling) than 
the heavier concrete or plastic BioSand filter.  Disturbances to the supernatant may decrease 
microbial and turbidity removal effectiveness.  Secondly, holding capacity of the pitcher filter 
(approximately 0.5 L as currently designed) is approximately twenty times less than that of 
the concrete BioSand filter.  Filtration times for larger volumes of water will thus be 
increased.

2.5  Ceramic Water Filters 
Project Coordinator: Rob Dies 
Ceramic water filters have been used in various places around the world as a means of 
treating drinking water at the household level. The fact that ceramic filters can be 
manufactured and produced by local ceramists with local materials makes them particularly 
attractive as a point-of-use treatment technology that is affordable, appropriate, and 
sustainable. Some examples include the Potters for Peace10 Filtron (Nicaragua), the 
TERAFIL terracotta filter (India), and the candle filter (India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Brazil, etc) 
(Figure 12).

Figure 12: Types of Ceramic Water Filter 
Although the use of ceramic water collection and storage vessels goes back centuries, there 
is little documentation and testing of the effectiveness of low-cost ceramic water filters both in 
the laboratory and especially in the field in developing countries.  
What research has been done suggests that the commercially available ceramic water filter 
systems in places such as India, Nepal, Nicaragua, and Brazil are a step in the right

direction, but could be improved to better meet the safe drinking water needs of citizens. In 
particular, many commercially available filter systems are too expensive for the poor who are 
suffering the most from waterborne diseases.  
Several organizations, including MIT, are currently pursuing laboratory and field research on 
the effectiveness of ceramic water filters. This year, the MIT Nepal Water Project continued 
research on the feasibility of developing a new disk-filter prototype that could potentially 
eliminate some of the problems associated with existing filters, at a retail price that is 
affordable to the poor.  

2.5.1  Previous Work 
MIT engineering student Junko Sagara was the first student to study ceramic water filters in 
Nepal in 1999/2000 as part of her Master of Engineering thesis (Sagara, 2000). C.S. Low 
continued research on ceramic water filters in 2001/2002 as part of his thesis on “Appropriate 
Microbial Indicator Tests for Drinking Water in Developing Countries and Assessment of 
Ceramic Water Filters” (Low, 2002). Low worked closely with ceramist Mr. Hari Govinda 
Prajapati of Madhyapur Clay Crafts in Thimi Nepal, who had originally been located and 
contacted by Junko Sagara, to develop the first version of a ceramic disk filter.  
A number of engineering students have also carried out research on ceramic water filters in 
Nicaragua. In particular, Daniele Lantagne conducted an in-depth study of the Potters for 
Peace (PFP) Filtron filter in 2001 (Lantagne, 2001) and Rebeca Hwang recently carried out 
research on evaluating the effectiveness of a monitoring program in conjunction with the PFP 
Filtron (Hwang, 2003).  
As part of the ongoing effort to understand and improve ceramic water filters in Nepal, 
Nicaragua and elsewhere, a team of engineering and business students (named CeraMIT) 
was formed this year to continue working on developing a ceramic water filter for Nepal.  
Four students formed the CeraMIT Nepal Team:  
•  Rob Dies, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, MEng Candidate 
•  Steve Perreault, Sloan School of Management, MBA Candidate 
•  Bobby Wilson, Sloan School of Management, MBA Candidate 
•  Laura Ann Jones, Sloan School of Management, MBA/TPP Candidate 
CeraMIT conducted a three-week-long field study in Nepal during January 2003. This 
research culminated in several recommendations for the development of a grassroots 
ceramic water filter business in Nepal (CeraMIT, 2003; Dies, 2003)  
On return from Nepal, mechanical engineering senior student Lily Cheung joined the 
CeraMIT team to develop one of the prototype designs that was recommended by CeraMIT, 
as part of her senior thesis (Cheung, 2003).   

2.5.2  Overview of Ceramic Water Filters  
Ceramic water filters can be categorized according to various key parameters:  
1.  Shape (e.g.: candle element, disk, pot) (Figure 12); 
2.  Type of clay (e.g.: white kaolin, red terracotta, black clay…);  
3.  Combustible material (e.g.: sawdust, flour, risk husk…). 

Ceramic water filters can also be described by their function(s):  

 

23

1.  Microbial removal (e.g.: Potters for Peace Filtron); 
2.  Chemical contaminant removal such as arsenic and iron (e.g.: 3 Kolshi filter for 
arsenic) (Hurd, 2001; Tabbal, 2003);  
3.  Secondary contaminant removal like taste and odor (e.g.: Katadyn®11Gravidyn 
ceramic candle filter with activated carbon). 

Other key variables that influence the properties of ceramic water filters include:  
1.  Use of additional materials in production (e.g.: grog, sand, combustible materials…); 
2.  Firing temperature;  
3.  Mode of production (e.g.: hand mold, wheel, mechanical press).  

The entire filter unit is often defined in terms of two components: the filter element or media 
through which water passes and the filter system which houses the media, usually consisting 
of an upper and lower storage vessel for holding water (Figure 13).

2.5.3  Production Process 
The ceramic water filter production process follows some common steps regardless of the 
type of filter being manufactured. The process typically begins with material selection and 
processing; followed by shaping and pressing the filter element into a mold; firing; drying and 
then potentially treating the filter with a disinfectant such as colloidal silver (Figure 14).

2.5.4  Laboratory Testing 
Laboratory tests of twelve disk filters (three types) and five candle filters were carried out by 
engineering student Rob Dies at the Environment and Public Health Organization (ENPHO) 
in January 2003 (Dies, 2003). The purpose of the laboratory testing of various ceramic filter 
element shapes and media was to do a preliminary comparison of filter shapes (candle 
versus disk); filter media (white clay versus red clay versus black clay); filter flow rates; 
production methodology; and to evaluate the effectiveness of colloidal silver at removing 
microbial contamination across a fairly broad range of materials and products. This testing 
distinguishes the testing from previous years where only one type of ceramic filter (e.g.: Hari 
Govinda candle filter, Potters for Peace Filtron, TERAFIL disk filter) was tested.  
Based on microbial removal efficiency and flow rate, the most promising filter elements that 
were tested were the Katadyn® drip filters (Ceradyn and Gravidyn); the modified-Hari 
Govinda candle filter coated with colloidal silver; and the Reid Harvey red-clay grog disk filter 
coated with colloidal silver. All four filters had comparable flow rates ranging from 650 to 800 
mL/hr/filter. The microbial log-reduction value (LRV) for all three candle filters was 1.9 for 
total coliform and 1.7 for E.coli, given a raw water total coliform concentration of 89 cfu/100 
mL and E.coli concentration of 56 cfu/100 mL. The LRV for Harvey’s disk filter was 2.6 for 
total coliform and 2.9 for E.coli, given a raw water total coliform concentration of 2,500 
cfu/100 mL and E.coli concentration of 1,561 cfu/100 mL.  
No conclusions can be drawn comparing the three candle filters to the one disk filter since 
different raw-water microbial concentrations were used for the testing of each group; 
however, these four filters offer a starting point for future product development and research.  
The results also support the hypothesis that colloidal silver acts as a bactericide and aids in 
the inactivation of indicator microorganisms such as total coliform and E.coli bacteria; 
however, more testing is required to determine the effectiveness of colloidal silver over 
longer periods of time (greater than one day) and after repeated usage of the filter system.  

2.5.5  Prototype Development 
Based on the research conducted over the past eight months and field work in Nepal, the 
CeraMIT team formulated a number of important product attributes or performance goals for 
the design of a ceramic water filter system (Table 5) (CeraMIT, 2003).

one bucket should fit into the other); 
•  Lid to cover the top bucket; 
•  Optional stand. 

•  Disk element should be replaceable 
just like the candle filters; 
•  Coated with colloidal silver. 

 
Mechanical engineering student Lily Cheung took these design recommendations and 
developed the first working prototype called the “Lily Filter” as part of her senior thesis 
(Figure 15) (Cheung, 2003).  
The Lily Filter consists of three components: an upper container for holding raw water, a 
lower container for holding filtered water, and a cartridge, which connects the upper and 
lower containers. The cartridge holds the disk filter, which is cemented into place using white 
cement. The cartridge rests on top of the lower storage container and the upper container fits 
into the top of the cartridge as shown in the figures below.  
Note that the prototype shown in is constructed of PVC. The final version will be constructed 
of HDPE or PET plastic material as shown in Figure 16.

2.5.6  Lab Certification  
Field and laboratory testing are indispensable components of product development; 
especially for a product such as a ceramic water filter where there are human health 
ramifications. Testing serves the purpose of providing feedback to designers who can then in 
turn improve product design and performance. At this time, there is no universal standard or 
certification process for evaluating the technical performance of low-cost point-of-use water 
treatment technologies such as ceramic water filters. Furthermore, field study methodologies 
are evolving to include a broader spectrum of performance parameters including the 
evaluation of health-based indicators, social acceptability, willingness to pay, and technical 
performance. Thus, the overall performance of a ceramic water filter can, and should, be 
certified under laboratory conditions as well as verified and evaluated under actual conditions 
in user households.  
In terms of certification, there is an emerging need for an international organization such as 
the WHO or the National Sanitation Foundation International (NSF)12 to define POU 
treatment technology standards for removing microbial contamination that are relevant to the 
circumstances under which these products are being developed. As a starting point, the 
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed a “Guide Standard and 
Protocol for Testing Microbial Water Purifiers” in 1987 (US EPA, 1987). NSF International 
has also developed two standards for drinking water treatment units that are potentially 
relevant to the certification of ceramic water filters, and new microbiological treatment 
standards for drinking water treatment units are being developed this year (NSFreMarks, 

                                                 
12 NSF International, The Public Health and Safety Company™ is a not-for-profit NGO that develops health and 
safety standards for product certification. Companies who sell products that meet NSF certification can then 
market their products as NSF certified. This in turn provides valuable information to consumers who make 
decisions between purchasing different products. NSF is widely recognized worldwide and is therefore a 
potential candidate for proposing health-based standards for certifying POU water treatment technologies.

2003). Furthermore, First Water® Ltd.13 has developed a grading system based on the log-
reduction value of microbiological organisms (Table 6) (Clasen, 2003).

These standards and guidelines provide a basis for developing a set of laboratory 
procedures for systematically evaluating filter performance, and possibly certifying a filter in 
the future. Ideally, the next step would be for an international organization such as the WHO, 
NSF International, or the emerging Household Water Treatment System Network14, or some 
sub-committee thereof, to agree upon appropriate standards for certification. The standards 
should be strict, but not too strict to impede people from developing POU technologies. 
Consistency in terms of evaluating performance is more important than having to necessarily 
meet strict drinking water quality guidelines or standards. The US EPA's required LRV values 
presented in their suggested guide are justifiably strict, but possibly too strict for some of the 
POU treatment technologies being developed for developing countries. Thus, a grading 
system such as that proposed by First Water(r) Ltd in Table 6 is a possible remedy to 
relaxing the guidelines slightly and to encourage the development of POU treatment 
technologies. 

2.5.7  Field Testing 
There is an important distinction to make between technical performance of a filter system 
under laboratory conditions and actual performance in the field. Aside from evaluating the 
technical performance of filters subjected to normal day-to-day use, field testing can also 
reveal many non-technical behavior-based issues that are arguably just as important in terms 
of measuring “performance” of a filter system, or, more specifically, finding the root causes 
for why the filter system is or is not performing to the standards that were achieved during 
certification under controlled laboratory conditions. This is particularly relevant for the 
developing country context since users are so intimately involved in the treatment of their 
water. The success of a ceramic water filter in the home, for example, depends on the user’s 
acceptance of the technology as well as behavior with respect to maintenance and general 
hygiene around the filter system.  
Thus, field testing requires more than just measuring the technical performance of a filter 
system if the root causes for the filter performance results are desired. It is useful to consider

both technical performance of the filter system and user behavior as separate, yet 
interdependent, factors that lead to an improvement or deterioration of human health, as 
affected by the quality of the drinking water.  The interconnections between human health, 
technical performance, and user behavior are demonstrated in Figure 17 as performance 
gaps. The technical and behavior gaps are defined in terms of the difference between an 
ideal state, or goal, and the actual state that is measured. A gap then leads to action, which 
is directed at changing the actual state to meet the intended goal and to eventually close the 
gap. Some factors that can affect user behavior, like education/awareness, product 
performance, and product design, are listed in Figure 17. Monitoring and evaluation are the 
activities that drive this process of improving overall product performance and, more 
importantly, human health over time.

2.5.8  Conclusion and Recommendations for Future Work 
Countries like Nepal face tough challenges in terms of providing safe, clean drinking water 
for their citizens. Centralized water supply systems may be a solution in the long-term, but 
the immediate need for clean drinking water necessitates new approaches that can provide 
solutions and solve the crisis now. Household water treatment technologies, such as ceramic 
water filters, offer a potentially viable solution to providing clean drinking water by treating 
water at the point-of-use. Advancements in low-cost ceramic water filter technology coupled 
with the pressing need for clean drinking water offers an attractive business opportunity for 
local Nepali entrepreneurs – especially local ceramists who have the resources and 
capability to manufacture ceramic water filters.  
The following recommendations are intended to help guide future work on the development 
of a ceramic water filter for Nepal.  
1.  Colloidal Silver Research. To determine the effectiveness of CS over time.  

 

30

2.  Colloidal Silver Production Process. To our knowledge, CS is not commercially 
available in Nepal and thus, research into methods of production or importing a product 
will be required, if the final ceramic filter is to use CS.  
3.  Ceramic Media/Material Research. To understand how the filter works on a microscopic 
level. 
4.  Hydraulic Studies. To compare theoretical equations of flow rate for a candle filter and a 
disk filter (Dies, 2003) to observed flow rates. Furthermore, to compare results with 
previous studies on the hydraulics of the Potters for Peace Filtron filter (Lantagne, 2001; 
Fahlin, 2003).  
5.  Product Certification. To develop a set of appropriate standards for certifying low-cost 
point-of-use water treatment technologies such as ceramic water filters.  
6.  Field Testing. To test effectiveness (i.e. technical performance (microbial removal 
efficiency, flow rate), social acceptability, health-based performance indicators, and 
willingness to pay) of the current prototype in the field.  
7.  Prototype Development. To continue testing the current prototype and to make 
improvements as necessary before brining it to Nepal next January.  
8.  Ceramic Filter Element/Media. To develop or choose a ceramic filter element to go with 
the complete filter prototype.  
2.6  Solar Disinfection 
Project Coordinator: Xanat Flores 
There have been many studies done around the world with a type of solar disinfection of 
drinking water usually with plastic PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottles known as Solar 
Disinfection SODIS. This technology is based on the fact that UV light in a range of 315 to 
400 ηm , also known as UVA, is able to cause DNA damage in living cells, and create highly 
destructive oxygen species (if sufficient amounts of oxygen are present), thus inactivating the 
pathogen cell. These oxygen species are enhanced by oxygenation (Oates, 2001; Reed, 
1996). 
It has been known that water also absorbs red and infrared light creating heat, which could 
lead to pasteurization if it reaches a certain temperature.  The combined effects of radiation 
and heating to temperatures of 50 or 60 °C turn into a combined synergistic germicidal effect 
against viruses, bacteria and parasites, more powerful than each (Sobsey, 2002).  
SODIS consists on putting plastic (PET) bottles filled with water and exposing them to the 
sun. Studies around the world have shown SODIS to be efficient in the inactivation and 
destruction of pathogen bacteria. Most of these studies have been made for household level 
and small water quantities, showing an economical application due to its low cost. 
Most of the tests that have been performed to evaluate SODIS effectiveness have used 
indicators of Total Coliforms (Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Serratia) and 
Escherichia Coli. The primary reason to use these organisms is due to the fact that 95% of 
these are present in fecal materials, and fecal contamination is the main cause of deadly 
waterborne diseases in developing countries (Martin, 2000).  
Earlier studies have been done in Nepal by M.I.T. Master of Engineering students Amer 
Khayyat (2000), Megan Smith (2001), and Harvard School of Public Health doctoral student

Cathy Pham (Smith, 2001) concerning SODIS, finding satisfactory physical conditions for 
solar disinfection implementation, and recommending a two-day exposure time. Solar 
radiation has been found to meet the 500W/m2 threshold through most of the year (Smith, 
2001). This is verified by the fact that Nepal is located within the 15N and 35N latitude area, 
that is known to be one the most favorable areas for solar radiation (Acra Aftim, et al, 1984). 
However, informal surveys of users in Lumbini, Nepal, who has been taught to use this 
system, expressed concern about the amount of work needed to be performed every day in 
order to achieve sufficient radiation exposure, and did not continue with this practice over the 
medium or long term. 
Some of the research done in many places around the world, as well as the research done 
by previous M. Eng. students, have shown that the key variables are: sun radiation levels, 
temperature and turbidity in the water, exposure times and type of recipients. The limitations 
of the SODIS system are: 
It takes two days for SODIS to produce safe drinking water under challenging climate 
• 
conditions of winter and monsoon in Nepal. 
It’s not suitable to disinfect large quantities of water. 
• 
•  SODIS cannot assure protection against recontamination 
•  PET bottles might not be available or might create disposal pollution problems. 
It requires comprehensive training and coaching to correctly apply SODIS. 
• 
Another approach that has not been as broadly studied is the continuous solar disinfection 
system. This system usually consists of a tank, a heat exchanger and a reactor of direct solar 
exposition. The purpose of this approach is to be able to supply water at any given time 
continuously, without having to wait for two days to have safe drinking water. However this 
system has not been so popular due to its complexity and the costs (increased due to the 
necessity of more sophisticated equipment). Thus, continuous systems have not been 
implemented at a household level in low-income countries. 

2.6.1  SODIS Study Objective. 
The invention of a semi-continuous solar disinfection system (SC-SODIS) is an innovation 
that overcomes limitations and disadvantages of previous point-of-use systems (specifically 
solar disinfections systems; i.e. SODIS). SC-SODIS promises to become a widely accepted 
(technologically, economic, and socio-culturally) system. 
The  purpose  of  the  present  SODIS  study  is  to  review  different  SODIS  experiments  and 
findings 
from  developing  countries  with  similar  social,  environmental  and  political 
characteristics  as  the  ones  seen  in  Nepal,  and  to  contribute  new  SC-SODIS  field  work  by 
performing innovative experiments.  
Some of the essential factors to consider in a semi-continuous SODIS system are: 
•  Environmental and site  factors: solar  radiation on average guarantees 5 hour 500W/m2 
most of the time throughout the year.  
•  Characteristics  of  the  water:  type  and  concentration  of  pollutants  (chemical  or 
biological), flux to be treated. 
•  WHO guidelines for E. Coli and hazardous chemicals.

•  Social:  research  done  by  M.I.T.  Master  of  Engineering  student  Xanat  Flores  on  the 
need  to  educate  people  in  Nepal  to  learn  about  the  project,  how  it  works  and 
maintenance requirements. 
•  Selection  of  the  optimal  process:  the  final  prototype  selected  after  research  and 
experimentation. 
•  The project has to be economically viable: this will depend on the process selection 
and the materials used, trying to get to the most saving solution possible. We have 
tried to design a system that requires low-tech approaches. For example, in Nepal 
sometimes there is no electrical power available, so we would like the system to 
operate independent of electrical power. 

2.6.2  Prototype System 
This  system  (Figure 18)  consists of arranged PET bottles  in parallel  fixed  together  in  such a 
way that water will pass through the bottles with a flow that will allow an exposure time of two 
days  (exposure  time  recommended  to  obtain  0  CFU  E.  Coli  as  recommended  by  WHO 
Guidelines  (1997))  through each one of  the bottles. This  system  can work by gravity, placed 
on  the  roof of  the houses where polluted water with  turbidity of  less  than 30 NTU will be  fed. 
There  will  also  be  a  valve  that  will  be  set  to  a  certain  flux  to  assure  complete  water 
disinfection;  (see Figure 18), and a second valve  to close  the  flow when  the system  is not  in 
use  (i.e.  during  the  night)  and  is  controlled  by  the  householders.  As  part  of  the  overall 
system,  there  will  be  a  need  for  a  storage  tank  in  order  to  be  able  to  store  the  water  as  it 
becomes purified. However, it is not recommended to have long storage times, since there is 
the possibility of microbial  regrowth and  recontamination. Thus a daily average  consumption 
equal  to  the  amount  of  water  produced  by  the  solar  disinfection  system  is  recommended.  
The system (Figure 19) requires the use of a holding tank on a roof or another high elevation 
spot that can be filled manually or by electric pump.

Within the system other variables can be studied, including the size of the containers,

or residence times, temperature effects, etc.. Due to the short time available for experimental 
work, only exposure or residence time variables have been studied so far.

2.6.3  SC-SODIS feasibility assessment 
Data collected during the month of January 2003 in Lumbini, Nepal, forms the basis for the 
feasibility assessment of SC-SODIS. The overall purpose of this study was to assess the 
sustainability of the SC-SODIS system. To that end, the data collected can be divided into 
three different categories:  
1)  Technical Feasibility: 
a.  Is a disinfection system needed? 
b.  Is solar disinfection (based on radiation data) applicable in the area? 
Is this system able to kill fecal bacteria effectively in order to reduce the 
c. 
incidence of waterborne related diseases? 
d.  What is the minimum residence time necessary to obtain safe drinking water? 
e.  How many liters of pure drinking water can be produced a day? 
2)  Social Feasibility 
a.  Is it easy to build, use and maintain? 
b.  Can it be locally operated and maintained? 
c.  How understandable is the system in order to be used properly? 
d.  What other water purification options are there in the area?

3)  Economical Feasibility 
a.  How much are people willing to pay for disinfection systems? 
b.  How much does the building of the system cost? 
c.  Operation and maintenance costs? 

• 

 
In order to address these questions, the following studies were made of the SC-SODIS 
system prototype built in Lumbini, Nepal during the month of January: 
•  Well measurement of fecal contamination; need of a disinfection technology 
for Nepal 
•  Solar radiation measurement to assess feasibility of reaching 500W/m2 for 5 
hours in a normal summer day  
Informal survey to get a preliminary sense of the social acceptability of SC-
SODIS 
•  Cost of operation and maintenance. 
2.6.4  Results and conclusions 
The laboratory and field tests made in Lumbini during the month of January were carried out 
to address the feasibility of the Semi-Continuous Solar Disinfection System (SC-SODIS) as a 
sustainable technology. The tests and data collected allow us to draw the following 
conclusions:  
a) Data collected from a well survey indicates the presence of E. Coli in 86% of the 
wells sampled in the 17 villages monitored by IBS and Buddhanagar village, using 
the membrane filtration bacteriological test (Standard Methods, 1998). However, the 
concentrations were very low, and may not represent a big threat to villagers. Local 
people, and some limited data collected in Lumbini, suggest that the number of 
contaminated wells, as well as the concentration of microbial contamination 
increases dramatically during the monsoon season, inferring the need of a water 
disinfection system technology. 
b) In what turned out to be one of the coldest months of January that local people 
could recall, data obtained from solar radiation didn’t reach the 500W/m2 for five 
hours threshold in any of the days in which the author took measurements in 
Lumbini during January 2003. This suggests that solar disinfection is not a feasible 
disinfection technology for Lumbini in the month of January for exposure times of 
less than one day. In some cases the integrated solar radiation reached 
2500Wh/m2 after two days. In other cases, this threshold was not reached even 
after two days of exposure. These conditions may serve as a lower limit of 
effectiveness of the system.  
d) In spite of the cold January weather, removal efficiencies obtained by SC-SODIS in 
the month of January in Lumbini suggest that even under bad weather, SC-SODIS 
can be a feasible solution if flow rates are adjusted to weather conditions (reduced 
flow rates have a tendency to increase removal efficiency). However, this 
preliminary result can be considered just that, and further studies should be made in

the winter season at this site in order to assess the efficiency of the system under 
“worst case” scenarios. 
e) Preliminary feedback from local people indicated they would prefer SC-SODIS to 
SODIS. SC-SODIS reduced laboriousness of solar disinfection and the number of 
PET bottles required (as well as disposed). 
f) SC-SODIS was constructed from 100% readily available materials found in Nepal 
(Lumbini and Butwal). 
g) Construction cost of the SC-SODIS system is below U.S.$0.50 (NRs 300).

2.7  Arsenic Study 
Project Coordinator: Georges Tabbal 

 

 

2.7.1  Arsenic Situation in Nepal  
The first arsenic testing campaign was conducted in 1999-2000 by the Department of Water 
Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) of the Government of Nepal in cooperation with members of 
the MIT Nepal Water Project team of 2000. In one of its 1999-2000 studies conducted in the 
districts of Jhapa, Morang and Sunsari, DWSS found that 9% of the 268 tube well water 
samples contained arsenic above the WHO standard (Nepal Red Cross Society, 2000).  An 
MIT study conducted by Patricia Halsey found that 18% of the tube wells tested in two 
districts of the Terai region of Nepal contained arsenic over 10 µg/L (Halsey, 2000).   
Since then, at least three organizations, Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Support Program 
(RWSSSP), Environment and Public Health Organization (ENPHO) and the Japan/Nepal 
Red Cross have been deeply involved in issues related to the arsenic problem in Nepal. The 
rural population of Nepal started switching their drinking water supply from surface water to 
groundwater in the early 1980’s. RWSSSP and the Japan/Nepal Red Cross installed a big 
portion of the tubewells that are currently being used by the population to pump groundwater. 
As such, when arsenic was discovered in the water pumped from these wells, these two 
organizations felt responsible for ensuring that it is safe to drink. They each engaged in a 
campaign to test their wells for arsenic content and to distribute arsenic filters to the 
households using their wells. ENPHO’s role has been as the lead water testing lab for 
arsenic analysis.  

2.7.2  Arsenic Removal Technologies  
Three types of arsenic removal technologies are currently in use in Nepal. These 
technologies are: the Three-Kolshi, the Two-Kolshi and the Arsenic-Biosand filter. 

THREE-KOLSHI 
A "kolshi" is the clay water pitcher used for collecting water throughout Bangladesh, Nepal 
and much of South Asia. The Three-Kolshi filter consists of three kolshis stacked on top of 
the other. The top two kolshis are perforated at the bottom to allow water to pass through 
them. Each kolshi contains different materials with a specific function that allows for arsenic 
removal:  
The top kolshi contains 3 Kg of iron fillings (representing about 1/6 of the total kolshi volume) 
and 2 Kg of coarse sand. About one third of the kolshi contains materials while the rest of the 
volume is occupied by raw water. 
The middle kolshi contains 2 kg of fine sand and 1kg of wood charcoal of a consistent size, 
avoiding fine wood ash, which dissolves and produces an undesirable basic water solution. 
Materials occupy about one sixth of the kolshi. 
The bottom kolshi is simply a collection container. Filtered water collects in this recipient and 
is directly decanted from it for use. 
The arsenic removal process associated with this filter is fairly simple. The raw water causes 
the iron filings to rust thus creating ferric oxide. The arsenic will sorb onto the ferric oxide 
particles and then percolate down the system with the water. The sand contained in the top 

 

37

 
 
 

Clean Water for Nepal, Inc.  
77 Massachusetts Avenue, 1-143 
Cambridge, MA 02139 

 

 

two kolshis will trap these particles, along with the arsenic sorbed onto them. The arsenic 
content of the water collected in the bottom kolshi should then be a tiny fraction of the 
arsenic content of the original raw water (Murcott, 2000). 

TWO-KOLSHI 
The system consists of a 20-liter plastic mixing bucket and a filtration unit consisting of two 
Kolshis placed one on top of the other. In order to operate, the filter requires a regular source 
of a chemical packet manufactured by ENPHO and distributed by both ENPHO and 
RWSSSP. In this process arsenic is removed by coagulation and co-precipitation followed by 
filtration. ENPHO’s procedure for training households in the use of this system is as follows: 
1.  Collect approximately 20 liters of water in a bucket. 
2.  Pour the contents of 1 packet of chemicals into the collected water. 
3.  Stir  vigorously  using  a  wooden  stirring  rod  for  approximately  1  minute  to  achieve 
thorough mixing. 
4.  Allow  settling  for  30  minutes  and  then  stir  again  in  a  similar  manner  for  1  minute. 
Repeat  the  same  procedure  every  30  minutes  until  2  hours  have  passed  since  the 
initial mixing. However, do not stir at the 2 hours mark. 
5.  Pour  the  supernatant  water  into  the  filtration  unit  and  dispose  of  the  sludge  into  cow 
dung. 
6.  Collect  the  treated  water  from  the  spigot  of  the  collection  unit  and  use  this  water  for 
drinking and cooking. 
Each chemical packet weighs 4 grams and is used to treat 20 liters of contaminated water.  
The packet contains a 1:1 ratio, by weight, of ferric chloride and charcoal powder and 800 
milliliters of 8% sodium hypochlorite solution. In this process the ferric chloride coagulates 
and adsorbs arsenic in co-precipitation. The precipitate is then filtered by the Two-Kolshi unit. 
Hypochlorite is used as an oxidant to facilitate the oxidation of arsenite to arsenate as 
arsenate is more effectively removed than arsenite.  In addition, hypochlorite significantly 
reduces the microbial contamination of treated water. The charcoal powder is used as an 
adsorbent.  It removes residual chlorine resulting from the use of hypochlorite and helps 
reduce other contaminants in the water (Hwang, 2002). 

ARSENIC-BIOSAND FILTER (ABF) 
An M.Eng alumnus, Tommy Ngai designed this filter. He won a research prize, the Lemelson 
International Award, at the 2002 MIT IDEAS competition for his design of the Arsenic-
Biosand filter. The prize allowed him to conduct two other field visits to Nepal in September 
2002 and in January 2003. His design combines two existing technologies: the Three-Kolshi 
system used for arsenic removal and the Biosand filter used for bacterial removal.  
The combined-filter design consists of a concrete BioSand filter. The construction of the 
combined-filter is simple.  First, a concrete mold is built, with a plastic pipe connected to the 
bottom.  Gravel, coarse sand and fine sand are placed in the concrete mold.  Then, a square 
metal diffuser is constructed.  About 5 Kg of iron nails are then added on top of the diffuser.  
Finally, the filter is capped with a metallic cover to avoid the introduction of any outside 
contamination into the filter. In about two weeks, a biofilm layer will be fully grown on top of 
the fine sand layer. This biofilm will kill any pathogens that are present in the raw water that 
is poured in the filter. The filter is very easy to operate. The raw water is poured into the filter

from the top and allowed to percolate through it. The treated water will then come out from 
the plastic pipe at the bottom. It can be collected by any recipient placed under the pipe. 
The arsenic removal process associated with this filter is similar to the Three-Kolshi one. The 
raw water causes the iron nails to rust thus creating ferric oxide. The arsenic will sorb onto 
the ferric oxide particles and then percolate down the system with the water. The sand 
contained in the filter will trap these particles, along with the arsenic sorbed onto them. The 
arsenic content of the water collected from the plastic pipe should then be a tiny fraction of 
the arsenic content of the original raw water. 

2.6.5  Study Design 
Three types of arsenic removal technologies have been distributed so far: Arsenic-Biosand, 
Three-Kolshi and Two-Kolshi. These filters are currently being tested extensively on a 
technical level by the various organizations on the ground. However, no comprehensive 
social acceptability study had been done of these three filters. Georges Tabbal traveled to 
Nepal in January 2003 as part of the Nepal Water Project team to do such a social 
acceptability study. His study tried to answer the following two questions:  
-  What is the level of arsenic awareness of the affected population? 
 
-  What is the social acceptability of each of the three types of filters? 
In order to answer these questions Tabbal conducted a survey at the household level in 
three of the affected districts of Nepal: Nawalparasi, Rupandehi and Kapilvastu. The survey 
instrument was drafted in Cambridge in the fall of 2002 using a combination of a 
questionnaire style and an interview style methodology.  
With the interest of making the study more complete, he also conducted a technical 
evaluation of the filters, namely measuring their arsenic removal rates and their flow rates. In 
addition he assembled as much as possible previous technical results of the various NGO’s 
on the ground.  

2.6.6  Technical Evaluation 

2.6.6.1  Arsenic Removal Rates 
The arsenic removal performance of the three filters was measured by four different sources: 
the author, Tommy Ngai, RWSSSP and ENPHO. The first three sources measured arsenic 
concentrations by using the Arsenic Check Field Test Kit by Industrial Test Systems Inc. 
(ITS), whereas ENPHO used a laboratory method called hybrid generation atomic 
spectrometry (HGAAS). 
The author conducted his tests in the month of January 2003 when he visited Nepal with the 
MIT Nepal Water Project team. Tommy Ngai and his IDEAS competition teammate from 
Stanford University, Sophie Walewijk, undertook their tests in Nepal in December 2002 while 
they were conducting a study on the ABF with RWSSSP. Their results come from a report 
they jointly wrote for RWSSSP: “The ABF Project (Ngai, T and Walewijk, S, 2003)”.  
RWSSSP conducted its tests in the fall of 2002 and the results were given to Georges 
Tabbal by Kalawati Pokharel, the senior arsenic technician at RWSSSP. The ENPHO test 
results were taken from Soon Kyu Hwang’s thesis, a previous M.Eng student who conducted 
a study on the Two-Kolshi filter, and were conducted in the fall of 2001 (Hwang, 2002).

One of the two methods, ITS test kit or HGAAS was used to evaluate the arsenic content of 
the influent and effluent water. The removal rate was obtained by subtracting the ratio of the 
effluent concentration by the influent concentration from 1.

2.6.6.2  Flow Rates  
The flow rate of the Three-Kolshi was measured extensively by ENPHO over the past two 
years as part of their pilot study to determine the effectiveness of this filer. The flow rate of 
the Arsenic-Biosand filter was measured by Tommy Ngai during his January 2003 trip to 
Nepal. No information is currently available on the flow rate of the Two-Kolshi at this time. 
The flow rate results of the various filters is shown in Table 8.

2.6.7  Social Evaluation  
A survey instrument was devised to try to answer the two social acceptability questions 
described in section 2.6.5.   

2.6.7.1  Background Research  
The background research that was conducted to create the survey instrument used in this 
study involved four components: 
•  A review of Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) surveys; 
•  A review of Rapid Assessment (RA) surveys;  
•  A review of three previous M.Eng Theses: Nathaniel Paynter (2000), Hannah Sullivan 
(2002) and Arun Varghese (2002); 
•  A review of the research plan of a current project: “Evaluation of Ceramic Microfilter in 
Bolivia” conducted by Tom Clasen, affiliated with the London School of Hygiene and 
Tropical Medicine, with input from the Center for Disease Control and the Pan-
American Health Organization. 
After conducting the background research, Tabbal concluded that two types of survey 
instrument are usually used: The questionnaire type and the interview type.  

Questionnaire Surveys 
This type of survey is always rigidly constructed with little or no room for interpretation. Each 
question is strictly close-ended, and the responses are either in a multiple-choice format or 
scaled. The different responses are then compiled into statistical charts to provide accurate 
information on trends in health and population. 

Interview-Based Surveys 
An interview-based survey has a less rigid format then the questionnaire-based survey. 
Although the surveyor starts the survey with a set of fixed questions, he is free to add, 
remove or change questions during the survey to accommodate the specificities of the 
respondent. Unlike the questionnaire survey, it gives the interviewer room for interpreting 
people’s answers. 
Tabbal decided to create a survey instrument that would combine the two types of surveys. 
The original survey instrument that he devised prior to his trip to Nepal was strictly a 
questionnaire type of survey. As he conducted his survey in the field, he altered his survey to 
reflect some characteristics of the surveyed population that he did not foresee prior to his 
arrival to Nepal. This modification of the survey instrument is not allowed in a questionnaire 
survey and is a characteristic of an interview survey. As such, his survey instrument evolved 
into something he called a questionnaire/interview hybrid as he kept some questions from 
the original instrument and modified others during the course of his site visit. This 
unconventional type of survey instrument was attractive to Tabbal prior to his site visit to 
Nepal. It allows the surveyor of devising an original survey instrument by using the limited 
knowledge that he has about the surveyed population prior to his site visit. As he conducts 
his survey in the field, his knowledge of the population increases, and as such he is free to 
alter this survey instrument to reflect this new knowledge

2.6.7.2  Conclusions of Social Study  

 

ARSENIC AWARENESS 
Sixty-three percent of the 45 respondents asked to define arsenic associated arsenic with a 
health hazard. These respondents defined arsenic as being a “poison”, a “disease” or a 
“danger”. Sixty-six percent of the 54 respondents asked if they saw a correlation between 
removing arsenic from water and protecting their health answered by “Yes”. It is therefore 
safe to assert that about two thirds of the surveyed respondents consider arsenic to be a 
health hazard.  
Since arsenic was discovered in Nepal recently, these results seem to indicate a relatively 
high level of arsenic awareness in Nepal. It should be remembered that the first discovery of 
an arsenic contaminated well in Nepal was in 1999. The filters were first distributed to the 
affected villagers in 2002, or about three years after the discovery of arsenic in the 
groundwater supply of Nepal. This study was conducted in January 2003, four years after the 
first arsenic discovery and only a few months after the initiation of the filter distribution. In 
light of these considerations, the statistics revealed by this portion of the survey are 
extremely encouraging, and demonstrate a relative high level of arsenic awareness that will 
presumably only increase in the coming years, or even months. 

SOC IAL ACCEPTABILITY OF EACH TYPE OF FILTER 
Some of the survey results related to the social acceptability results of each type of filter 
appeared counter-intuitive. The social acceptability results of the flow rate of each type of 
filter is a good example of such counter-intuitive results.    
Seventy-five percent of the respondents said that they were satisfied with the flow rate of the 
Arsenic-Biosand filter. This proportion seems to be quite low considering that the Biosand 
filter has a flow rate sufficient to accommodate a normal size Nepali family (10-20 L/hr). This 
is especially striking when one compares it with the similar acceptance rate of the Tree-
Kolshi (75 %), which has a much lower flow rate (0.5-3 L/hr).   
Because of these counter-intuitive results, no conclusions on the social acceptability of the 
filters will be included in this report.

Clean  Water  for  Nepal  consists  of  seven  Master  of  Engineering  Students,  in  the 
Environmental and Water Quality specialty, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Its 
headquarters  are  located  at  77 Massachusetts  Avenue,  1-143,  Cambridge, Ma,  02139.  The 
team  members  are  Rob  Dies,  Xanat  Flores,  Melanie  Pincus,  and  Georges  Tabbal.  Each 
team member has focused on a specific area of study as described below.  
Rob Dies  . He  investigated  the  strengths  and weaknesses of  various  ceramic  filters  as  they 
apply to point-of-use water treatment in Nepal. He obtained his bachelor’s in Applied Science 
in  Civil  Engineering  (Environmental  Option)  with  a  minor  in  commerce  degree  at  the 
University  of  British  Columbia.  Some  of  the  courses  of  interest  he  took  as  part  of  his 
undergraduate  studies  were:  courses  in  hydrology,  open  channel  hydraulics,  geology, 
aquatic  chemistry, microbiology,  ecology,  sustainability,  statistics,  economics,  and  business.  
He  also  did  a  third  year  exchange  program  to  the  University  of Western  Australia  where  he 
completed  courses  offered  in  the  Civil  Engineering  Department  and  the  Centre  for  Water 
Research. He  has  had  a  broad work  experience: Association  of Professional Engineers  and 
Geoscientists  of  British  Columbia  as  a  sustainability  researcher;  WaterTrax,  Inc.  as  a 
Consultant;  Charles  Howard  &  Associates  Ltd  as  a  Junior  Engineer;  Greater  Vancouver 
Regional  District  (GVRD),  Sewerage  &  Drainage  Department  as  an  Engineer  Research 
Assistant;  and  at  the  GVRD,  Solid  Waste  Department  as  an  Engineer  Assistant.  He 
completed  the  following  subjects  while  at  MIT:  groundwater  hydrology,  water  resources 
systems,  coastal  engineering,  water  quality  modeling,  GIS,  system  dynamics,  and 
information  technology.  His  broad  experience,  combines  different  areas  of  study  and 
application  that  will  be  very  helpful  for  the  technical  expertise  that  will  be  provided  for  the 
ceramics water filter evaluation.  
Xanat  Flores  developed  and  evaluated  the  effectiveness,  performance,  and  feasibility  of  a 
solar  disinfection  system  that  combines  the  advantages  of  SODIS  and  continuous  solar 
disinfection  systems.  She  did  the  first  part  of  her  undergraduate  studies  in  Chemical 
Engineering  at  the  Universidad  Nacional  Autonoma  de  Mexico  in  Mexico  City.  She  finished 
her  undergraduate  studies  in  the  Universidad  de  las  Americas-  Puebla,  in  Puebla,  Mexico. 
Some  of  her  undergraduate  related  courses  were  Advanced  Biological  Processes  for 
Wastewater  Treatment  and Kinetics  of Biotechnological Processes. She  did  a  social  service 
work at the Regional Studies Center in Cholula, Puebla, Mexico, where she sampled water in 
several  rural  areas,  analyzed  water  to  meet  different  water  quality  standards  (pH,  turbidity, 
nitrogen  and  phosphorous  compounds,  total  coliforms,  chlorine,  electric  conductivity),  and 
co-wrote  a  proposal  for  governmental  actions  steps  to  improve  water  quality  in  rural  areas 
(including water  treatment plant proposal  that  involved solar disinfection). She completed  the 
following  subjects  while  at  MIT:  Groundwater  Hydrology,  Design  of  Water  Resources 
Systems, Environmental Engineering Applications of GIS, Environmental Organic Chemistry, 
and  Aquatic  Chemistry.  Her  experience  in  rural  communities  in  Mexico,  as  well  and  water 
treatment  and  purification  techniques  will  be  of  great  help  for  the  development  of  the 
proposed work. 
Melanie Pincus performed  laboratory and  field experiments  to quantify  the effects of source 
water  quality,  variable  ripening  periods  and  pause  times  on  Biosand  Filter  efficiency.  She 
obtained  her  bachelor’s  of  Science  degree  in  Civil  and  Environmental  Engineering  with  a 
focus  on  Environmental  Chemistry  at  the  MIT,  minoring  in  Literature.    Her  areas  of 
knowledge  include  Chemistry  (aquatic,  atmospheric,  biological,  environmental,  inorganic,

environmental  education,  environmental  law,  fluid  mechanics,  fluid  transport  processes, 
groundwater  hydrology,  hazardous  waste  remediation,  limnology,  toxicology  and  public 
health);  and  Laboratory  Techniques  (quantitative  and  qualitative  chemical  analysis,  pH, 
kinetics, visible/UV/IR spectroscopy, gas and  liquid chromatography, microbial measurement 
including  membrane  filtration  and  H2S  tests).  Her  work  experience  includes  environmental 
consulting for the John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, U.S. DOT and GEI 
Consultants,  Inc;  teaching  recitations  in  Biochemistry  and  Organic  Chemistry  at  the 
Massachusetts  Institute  of  Technology;  and  research  at  the  Harvard  Graduate  School  of 
Education  in  their Cognitive Skills Group.   Her  broad  experience  in  environmental  chemistry 
and laboratory techniques will be of much help towards development of the proposed work. 
Georges  Tabbal  completed  a  technical,  social  and  economical  evaluation  of  some  of  the 
existing arsenic removal technologies. He obtained his bachelor’s in Civil Engineering degree 
at  McGill  University.  He  has  worked  for  Peter  Kiewit  Sons  Co.  Ltd  as  a  project  engineer; 
Camp Dresser and McKee as part of a  final year project  that consisted of a water  resources 
design plan; and Inspec-Sol as an assistant engineer in the environmental department.
