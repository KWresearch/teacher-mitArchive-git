Existing Studies
(cid:122) USGS National Reconnaissance (1999-2000)
(cid:122) CDC study at Chattahoochee River (summer 
1999)

DRUGSTORE COWBOYS INC.

USGS study
(cid:122) Sampled 139 streams in 30 states
(cid:122) Sampled for 95 Organic Wastewater Contaminants
(cid:122) OCWs present at ~80% of streams sampled
(cid:122) Very low concentrations (order of ng/l) but 
surprisingly high because most are man made 
compounds
(cid:122) Persistence in natural environment

DRUGSTORE COWBOYS INC.

CDC study
(cid:122) Concentrations collected for over 100 compounds along 
50 mile stretch of Chattahoochee River Basin, from 
Buford, GA to Atlanta, GA

(cid:122) Measurements taken for WWTP discharge and both 
intake and outflow at drinking water treatment plants 
(DWTP)
(cid:122) Revealed Significant Presence of OCWs

Magnitude of problem
(cid:122) OCWs are currently present at low concentrations 
but their release in the environment is expected to 
continue
(cid:122) Unknown effects in human health, potential risk of 
long term exposure
(cid:122) Pharmaceutical compounds and their metabolites 
gravest fear
(cid:122) Hot current scientific problem
(cid:122) On going research Through-out the world

approach to the problem

(cid:122) Create a “black box” mass balance model

Chattahoochee River 
Characteristics

(cid:122) General Description:
(cid:122) Length of 48 miles from Buford to Atlanta, GA
(cid:122) Landscape predominantly forestland
(cid:122) Flow oscillates with power generation schedule at Buford Dam 
(550 to 7500 cfs, average 2100 cfs)
(cid:122) Flow Characteristics
(cid:122) Flow rates determined from USGS stream gages stationed 
along Chattahoochee and several tributaries
(cid:122) WWTP and DWTP flows based on average operation

DRUGSTORE COWBOYS INC.

Black Box Model
(cid:122) Wastewater discharge only phosphate source 
considered

(cid:122) Flows based on average January stream gage 
readings

(cid:122) Average CDC concentrations combined with river 
flow to determine concentration in river 

(cid:122) Allows for estimation of rate of removal from natural 
sinks

DRUGSTORE COWBOYS INC.

Estimation of annual loading
(cid:122) Approximate loading into Chattahoochee River:
(cid:122) TBP and TCEP in USA: 2000 m3/year
(cid:122) TBEP in USA: 3000 m3/year
(cid:122) Population of Atlanta area: 2.8 million
(cid:122) Population of United States: 280 million
(cid:122) Thus, 20 - 30 m3/year produced of each chemical

(cid:122) Average volumetric flow of Chattahoochee River:                20 x 108
m3/year
(cid:122) Conclusion: ~10 - 15 ppb in river
(cid:122) Actual concentrations are .1 – 2 ppb
(cid:122) Overestimation due to all production going into streams

Estimates of influence of each 
process
(cid:122) Our simple calculations provide insight in the removal 
magnitude

DRUGSTORE COWBOYS INC.

Discussion of Estimates:
What they reveal
(cid:122) The only processes that seem to affect the 
phosphate esters are biodegradation and 
sorption to sediments
(cid:122) Especially for biodegradation great 
uncertainty exists and further sampling is 
needed. But it is the most promising one

DRUGSTORE COWBOYS INC.

In situ investigation
(cid:122) A visit to Chattahoochee river was decided that is 
needed
(cid:122) Provide Additional sampling tailored to exploring role 
of major degradation processes in phosphate 
removal
(cid:122) Drinking water treatment plant exploration
(cid:122) Meet with CDC staff to discuss data collection 
methods and results from their testing

Valuable Experiences
(cid:122) Nobody realized at first the problems associated 
with field work and sampling
(cid:122) Great logistical problems 
(cid:122) Countless possible sources of experimental error 
(cid:122) The most sophisticated sampling project undertaken 
up to now from MEng

(cid:122) Without Pete Shanahan’s help it couldn’t have been 
done
