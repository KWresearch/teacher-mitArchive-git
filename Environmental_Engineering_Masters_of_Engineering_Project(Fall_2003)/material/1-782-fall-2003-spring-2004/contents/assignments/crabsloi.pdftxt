Dear Dr. Shanahan and Ms. Lantagne; 

Caribbean  Research  Association  for  the  Betterment  of  water  reSources  (CRABS)  is 
writing  in  response  to  your  request  for  proposal  dated  September  2002  regarding  water 
quality  of  salt  ponds  and  watershed  management  in  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands.    After 
reviewing  your  request,  CRABS  has  assembled  a  team  of  engineers  and  scientists  to 
address  your  concerns  regarding  the water  quality  status  of wetland  areas  and watershed 
management  on  the  islands  of  St.  John,  St.  Thomas,  and  Haiti  due  to  an  increased  need 
for  this  information  by  local  managers,  contractors,  and  planners.    Team  members  from 
CRABS  have  the  experience  necessary  to  provide  quality  and  comprehensive  solutions 
for  the  USVI  Wetlands  Association.    Our  experience  lies  in  water  quality  analysis, 
watershed  modeling  and  analysis,  groundwater  and  sediment  analysis,  geographic 
information systems application, and water resources master planning. 

Knowing  that  wetlands  and  water  resources  are  precious  and  scarce  on  the  U.S.  Virgin 
Islands,  CRABS  will  not  only  gather  data  to  assess  the  present  conditions,  CRABS  will 
also  address  the  salt  ponds water  quality,  the  St.  John  desalination  plant,  and  the  overall 
water  resources  strategy  for  the  US  Virgin  Islands  and  Haiti.    A  description  of  the 
proposed  study  is outlined  in  the  subsequent paragraphs.   We  look  forward  to  submitting 
our full proposal by December 6, 2002. 

 WATER QUALITY  

Salt ponds in the U.S. Virgin Islands are a valuable resource, serving as a vital ecosystem 
between  the  sea  and  the  freshwater  on  the  island.   Threats  due  to  increased  development 
and  tourism  in  the  form of nutrient deposition,  increased  traffic,  and waste disposal have 

had  increasing  effects  on  these  wetlands  over  the  past  century.    Key  stakeholders  have 
identified  a  need  to  quantify  the  impacts  of  economic  growth  on  the  natural  balance  of 
the  islands  and  the National  Park.  CRABS  proposes  to  send  a  skilled  team  of  engineers 
to focus specifically on Salt Pond preservation.   

The team will first perform sampling and conduct an in-depth inventory of salt ponds and 
their  characteristics.    The  sampling  will  investigate  water,  sediment,  and  biota  in  salt 
ponds  on  the  island  of  St.  John.    Detailed  watershed  modeling  will  provide  additional 
insight into the current state of the Salt Ponds.   

After  the  current  state  of  the  Salt  Ponds  has  been  thoroughly  analyzed,  the  team  will 
quantify  the  various  impacts  of  factors  affecting  the  wetlands.    A  detailed  review  of 
ecological impacts of salt ponds in their current state, as well as the development of goals 
for  the  future,  will  provide  stakeholders  with  vital  information  on  preserving  ecological 
balance  on  the  islands.    Finally,  the  team will  provide  recommendations  to  optimize  the 
water quality of the Salt Ponds, thereby preserving natural plant, animal, and aquatic life.   

Don  Rose  is  a  hydrologist  with  over  two  years  of  experience  modeling  watersheds, 
performing  detailed  sampling  and  analysis  procedures,  and  developing  mitigation 
strategies.  Mr. Rose has extensive experience dealing with the specific  issues of concern 
in watersheds of tropical climates.  Mr. Rose has a BS in Civil Engineering Systems from 
the University of Pennsylvania, and  is currently a candidate for a Masters of Engineering 
in  Environmental  Engineering  from  MIT.    Mr.  Rose  will  be  focusing  on  detailed 
watershed modeling and analysis, as well as future impact assessment.   

Liam  Bossi,  an  environmental  engineer  and  conservationist  with  a  background  in 
chemical  engineering  and organic  chemistry, will work  to  assess  the water  quality  of  the 
salt  ponds  and  investigate  the  influence  of  the  island’s  burgeoning  development  on  the 
salt ponds.  While his focus will be on chemical analysis, the ecological aspect of the salt 
pond  will  also  be  given  considerable  attention.    Mr.  Bossi  has  a  degree  in  Chemical 
Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and is currently a candidate 
for a Masters of Engineering in Environmental Engineering from MIT.   

Alexa  Gangemi  will  serve  as  the  project  manager  overseeing  the  engineering  efforts  of 
the  CRABS  team  on  the  Salt  Ponds  project.    Ms.  Gangemi  will  be  specializing  in 
wetlands  ecology  and  species  preservation;  her  participation  in  the  project  will  focus  on 
the  ecological  impacts  of  Salt  Ponds  as well  as mitigation  strategies.   Ms. Gangemi will 
conduct  an  assessment  of  current  ecological  impacts  and  develop  long-term  plans  to 
sustain  vital  ecosystems.    Ms.  Gangemi  has  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  Mathematics  from 
Cornell  University  and  is  also  a  candidate  for  a  Masters  of  Engineering  degree  in 
Environmental Engineering from MIT.   

DESALINATION 

The  process  of  desalination  in  the US Virgin  Islands  provides  a  large  portion  of  potable 
drinking  water  to  the  islands’  citizens.    Desalination  is  usually  a  last  resort  for  drinking 

water  treatment  because  of  the  high  cost  per  unit water  produced  by  the  process.    These 
costs  often  can  contribute  substantial  annual  costs  to  a  government’s  total  budget.   
CRABS  proposes  to  send  a  skilled  water  resources  engineer  to  help  the  US  Virgin 
Island’s  governments  evaluate 
their  current  desalination  process  and  suggest 
improvements to reduce overall costs and maximize plant efficiency. 

The engineer will first perform an in-depth analysis of the current desalination techniques 
through  a  literature  review  and  then  examine  the  current  processes  in  use  in  the  US 
Virgin  Islands.    After  this  preliminary  assessment  a  detailed  examination  of  the  overall 
operational process will be conducted.  This will possibly  include water  sample analysis, 
energy cost analysis, and operational procedures. 

After  the  current  state  of  the  desalination  processes  has  been  thoroughly  analyzed,  the 
engineer will  summarize  the various  impacts of  factors  affecting  the process.   A detailed 
report will  help  plant  engineers  and management  understand  the  engineer’s  findings  and 
recommendations.   This analysis will provide CRABS with valuable  research  that can be 
applied  to  further  research  aimed  at  maximizing  the  efficiency  of  other  desalination 
plants. 

Chad  Stevens  will  serve  as  the  lead  engineer  in  the  effort  to  optimize  the  U.S.  Virgin 
Islands  desalination  process.  Mr.  Stevens  is  a  water  resources  engineer  specializing  in 
the  desalination  processes  used  for  drinking  water  treatment.    He  has  had  extensive 
experience  examining,  inspecting,  and  analyzing  numerous  types  and  sizes  of  drinking 
water  treatment  processes.  Mr.  Stevens  has  a  BS  in  Environmental  Resource 
Management  with  a  minor  in  Environmental  Engineering  from  Pennsylvania  State 
University,  and  is  also  a  candidate  for  a  Masters  of  Engineering  in  Environmental 
Engineering from MIT.   

Michelle Miilu will  study  the possibility of making desalination viable  for Haiti.   Due  to 
lack  of  infrastructure  in Haiti,  small-scale  solar  power  is  a  growing  source  of  energy  for 
Haitians.   Currently,  individual-use  solar  powered  desalination  exists  and Ms. Miilu will 
investigate  the  physical  and  economic  feasibility  of  upscaling  this  design  to  meet  water 
supply  needs  in  Haiti.  Ms.  Miilu  is  currently  a  Masters  of  Engineering  student  at  MIT 
with a Bachelor of Science degree in Natural Resources and Environmental Science from 
Purdue University.  She has 4 years of  experience  in  environmental  compliance working 
for the Alabama Department of Environmental Management. 

WATER RESOURCES EVALUATION 

Water  sources  are  scarce  on  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands  and  Haiti  due  to  increased 
development,  poor  economic  conditions,  and  the  natural  geology  and  climate.    Because 
of  this,  CRABS  intends  to  analyze  St.  John’s,  St.  Thomas’,  and  Haiti’s  water  resources 
both from an economic and environmental standpoint.  Based on this analysis, we plan to 
develop  strategies  for  water  reuse  and  watershed  management.    The  engineers  will  first 
examine  the current  status of water  resources on  the  islands by gathering data  from  local 

government  agencies  and  local  industry.  Then,  we  will  develop  alternatives  for  each  of 
these islands. 

Genevieve  Brin  will  investigate  water  resources  management  in  Haiti.    She  will  use  the 
Integrated Water  Resources Management  (IWRM)  technique  to  evaluate  the  present  the 
efficiency  of  present  water  uses  and  potential  developments.    She  will  analyze  past 
projects  to understand  their  successes or  failures.  Based on  these  analyses,  she will  look 
at a particular project in the Jolivert area.  She will develop a strategic plan for the growth 
of a chlorine generator project into the surrounding communities.  Ms. Brin is presently a 
Master  of  Engineering  student,  with  special  interest  in  water  resources  management  in 
developing countries.  She has international cooperation experience and she holds a Civil 
Engineering Bachelor degree from Polytechnique of Montreal University, Canada. 

Pablo  E.  Buscemi  will  conduct  research  on  “benchmarking”  of  Integrated  Water 
Resource Management (IWRM) on  the U.S. Virgin Islands.   By analyzing characteristics 
of  overall  water  supplies,  overall  water  demand,  and  present  water  resources 
management,  and  identifying  stakeholders  in  the  water  market,  he  intends  to  propose  a 
framework  for  action  towards  sustainability  of water  resources  on  the  islands.   Having  a 
clear  idea  on where water  resources  elements  stand  today will  allow  a  forecast  of  future 
path  of  water  resources  development.    His  intent  thus  will  be  to  achieve  a  view  that, 
considering  the  island’s  socioeconomic  and  cultural  characteristics,  can  provide 
innovative  solutions  for  the  future,  as  well  as  adapt  traditional  solutions  to  manage  the 
water  resources  in  this  particular  case.  He  will  try  to  reach  to  conclusions  that  could  be 
applied  to  a  typical  Caribbean  island’s  water  resource  management.  Another  important 
issue that will be developed jointly with other team members is to unify modeling criteria 
for  enabling  a  comparison  between  water  resources  management  in  a  developed  society 
and  its  counterpart  in  the  most  underdeveloped  country  in  the  Caribbean,  Haiti.    Mr. 
Buscemi  is  currently  a  candidate  for  a  Master  of  Engineering  in  Environmental 
Engineering  degree  at  MIT  and  graduated  as  a  Civil  Engineer  from  the  Universidad 
Catolica Argentina de Buenos Aires.  In addition, he has thirteen years of experience as a 
designer and contractor of water resource systems.   

Heather Cheslek  is  an  environmental  engineer with  over  three  years  of  experience  in  the 
water  resources  area  performing  various  watershed  analyses  throughout  the  United 
States.  She  has  a Bachelor  of  Science  degree  in Civil  Engineering  from Michigan  State 
University  and  is  a  candidate  for  a Master  of Engineering  in Environmental Engineering 
degree  from MIT. Ms. Cheslek will  focus her  efforts on determining  and quantifying  the 
water  use  on  both  the  St.  John  and  St.  Thomas  islands  by  analyzing  past  water  records 
from  the  Department  of  Public Works  and  major  stakeholders  in  order  to  provide  water 
reuse  strategies  specifically  to  minimize  the  need  for  desalination  and  to  identify  lavish 
water use practices.  

The project will require 3200 hours of professional staff  time  to complete.   Copies of  the 
team  members  resumes  are  attached  highlighting  the  relevant  qualifications  of  each 
member.    Should  you  have  further  questions  regarding  the  tasks  described  in  this  letter, 
please  do  not  hesitate  to  contact  us.  A  website  will  be  developed  and  maintained 

throughout  the project  duration  in order  to maintain  an open  relationship with  concerned 
citizens.    This  website  will  have  information  regarding  data,  relevant  documents,  and 
project  progress  updates.    By  utilizing  information    from  the  U.S.  Virgin  Islands  and 
Haiti to assist us in fulfilling the project goals, our hope is that this project contributes, at 
least  to  some  extent,  to  the  betterment  of  environmental  conditions  not  only  for  our  own 
time, but also for generations to come. 

Thank  you  for  your  time  and  consideration.    We  look  forward  to  submitting  our  full 
proposal by the December 6, 2002 deadline and working with you in the near future. 

Sincerely, 

Genevieve Brin
