Introduction 

During  the  summer  of  1999  the  U.S.  Center  for  Disease  Control  (CDC),  in  cooperation 
with  the  United  States  Geological  Survey  (USGS),  performed  an  extensive  sampling 
study  of  the  Chattahoochee  River  Basin  along  a  fifty-mile  stretch  just  north  of  Atlanta, 
Georgia.  The  purpose  of  the  study  was  to  measure  concentrations  of  several 
pharmaceuticals,  personal  care  products  (PPCPs),  and  organic  wastewater  compounds 
(OWCs)  at  several  sites  within  the  basin.    In  particular,  the  focus  was  on  major  point 
sources  to  the  river,  namely  wastewater  treatment  plant  effluents,  along  with 
concentrations  both  within  the  river  at  the  point  of  intake  for  drinking  water  treatment 
and  post-wastewater  treatment  discharge.    The  CDC  performed  a  preliminary  statistical 
analysis  of  the  data  resulting  from  the  study,  and  is  now  seeking  an  environmental 
engineering  firm  to  complement  this  work  by  lending  their  unique  perspective  and 
carrying out  their own study of  the data.   The CDC has expressed  interest  in having  their 
data  evaluated  from  an  engineering  point  of  view  in  hopes  of  drawing  sound,  well-
supported  conclusions.  One  especially  desired  result  is  to  have  a  surface  water  quality 
model developed that accurately depicts the fate and transport of PPCPs and OWCs in the 
Chattahoochee River. 

A  Request  for  Proposal  was  released  by  the  CDC  in  early  September,  2003  with  a 
December  5,  2003  response  deadline.    Drugstore  Cowboys,  Inc.  is  pleased  to  submit  a 
proposal  for  the  investigatory  analysis  of  pollutant  loading  and  transport  in  the 
Chattahoochee  River.    In  conjunction  with  the  submitted  written  proposal  a  regularly 
updated  website  outlining  Drugstore  Cowboys,  Inc.’s  efforts  thus  far  can  be  found  at 
http://web.mit.edu/andrewsm/www/DrugstoreCowboys.htm.

The Selected Family of Chemical Compounds – Phosphate Esters 

After  careful  consideration  of  the  available  data,  extensive  literature  review,  and 
deliberation  over  maximizing  the  possible  positive  impact  of  our  findings,  Drugstore 
Cowboys, Inc. proposes to investigate the fate of a group of phosphate esters.  

This  group  is  comprised of  three phosphate  esters:  tributyl phosphate  (TBP, CAS  #  126-
73-8),  tri(2-chloroethyl)  phosphate  (TCEP,  CAS  #  115-96-8),  and  tri(2-butoxyethyl) 
phosphate (TBEP, CAS # 78-51-3). Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. has chosen these phosphate 
esters based on the following reasons: 

Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. 

3 

•  The CDC-USGS study detected these compounds in most of the samples. 
•  Many  other  studies  report  the  presence  of  these  compounds  in  surface 
water and drinking water. 
•  The  phosphate  esters  exhibit  some  similar  chemical  characteristics, where 
other  chemicals  in  the  CDC-USGS  study  having  a  high  percentage  of 
detection did not exhibit similar properties. 
•  They  are  widely  used  as  flame-retardants,  plasticizers,  and  other  various 
products. 
•  They exhibit significant presence in the environment. 
•  To  our  knowledge,  there  has  not  been  any  prior  research  on  their  fate  in 
the aquatic environment.  

Analytical  methods  with  high  accuracy  are  available  for  measuring  their  concentration 
even in the order of parts per trillion. 

The Objective of the Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. Group Study 

The main objective of  the proposed  study  is  to  identify  the natural degradation processes 
that  most  greatly  affect  the  selected  phosphate  esters  in  the  aquatic  environment  and  to 
confirm  this  identification  with  analysis  of  the  known  data  and  the  Drugstore  Cowboys 
Inc.’s own data (to be collected in January 2004). Our first objective has been completed, 
with  a  thorough  analysis  located  later  in  this  report.  Ultimately  the  completion  of  the 
main  objective  will  lead  to  the  development  of  a  water  quality  model  for  the 
Chattahoochee  River  that  can  possibly  be  developed  and  generalized  for  other 
watersheds. 

Another  objective  of  this  study  is  to  investigate  the  fate  of  the  phosphate  esters  in 
drinking  water  treatment  plants  (DWTPs).  Specifically,  the  Drugstore  Cowboys  took 
samples  within  the  Chattahoochee Water  Treatment  Plant  in  Atlanta,  GA.  The  presence 
of the phosphate esters after each major process will be studied. In addition, the intake of 

Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. 

4 

the  plant  comes  from  the  Chattahoochee  River,  which  also  adds  to  the  surface  water 
analysis noted above. 

Finally,  the  last  objective  set  forth  by  Drugstore  Cowboys,  Inc.  is  to  investigate  the 
possibility  of  substantial  removal  of  the  selected  phosphate  esters  in  DWTPs  by  minor 
alterations  to  the  existing  treatment  process.  Advanced  Oxidation  Processes  will  be 
tested,  and  if  effective,  discussion  of  implementation  through  traditional  disinfection 
schemes like ozonation or UV disinfection will follow.

Background  

Emergence of Pharmaceuticals & Personal Care Compounds as Potential 
Environmental Contaminants 

One  of  the  main  current  concerns  is  the  increasing  occurrence  of  pharmaceuticals  and 
personal  care  compounds  in  the  natural  water  environment.  The  problem  was  first 
identified  in  the  late  seventies,  and  throughout  the  last  twenty  years,  there  have  been  an 
increased  number  of  reported  occurrences  of  these  chemical  compounds  in  natural water 
systems. 

The concentrations measured  range  from being on  the order of a  few nanograms per  liter 
in  surface  waters  to  a  few  micrograms  per  liter  in  wastewater  effluents.  These 
concentrations do not pose an  immediate  threat  to  the environment and human health but 
are alarming. The reason why pharmaceuticals have been a major concern is that they are 
highly  active  compounds  that  are  engineered  to  be  persistent  and  that  the  effects  of  long 
exposure  to  them  are  not  understood.  Besides  pharmaceuticals,  other  major  groups  of 
anthropogenic organic chemical compounds have been detected in the water environment 
in comparable concentrations.   

One  of  these  groups  is  the  phosphate  esters  that  are  primarily  used  as  flame-retardants 
and  plasticizers.  Even  though  their  nature  and  use  suggest  that  they  would  be  mainly 
found  in  industrial  effluents,  they  have  been  reported  in  a  wide  range  of  water  systems 
and even in drinking water distribution networks.  

History of Extensive Research to Identify the Occurrence of Man-Made Chemicals 

Since  the  early  eighties,  studies  reporting  the  occurrence  of  anthropogenic  organic 
chemicals  in  the  water  environment  were  made  in  Europe.  They  mainly  focused  on 
identifying  the  occurrence  of  pharmaceuticals  and  their  metabolites  in  river  and  lake 

Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. 

6 

systems.  Around  the  same  time,  studies  in  Japan  revealed  the  presence  of  industrial 
organic  chemicals  in  surface  waters  and  in  municipal  and  industrial  wastewaters.  In 
Canada  studies  as  early  as  1979  identified  anthropogenic  organic  chemicals  in  drinking 
water. 

In  response  to  the  emerging  environmental  concerns  regarding  OWCs,  the  U.S 
Geological  Survey  conducted  in  1999-2000  the  first  nationwide  reconnaissance  of  the 
occurrence of these chemical compounds in U.S. streams and rivers (Kolpin et al., 2002). 
The results were alarming since OWCs were found in 80% of the streams sampled.  

Following  the  findings of  the USGS  reconnaissance,  the Centers  for Disease Control and 
the  USGS 
initiated  a  study 
to  determine 
the  occurrence  of  commonly  used 
pharmaceuticals  and  OWCs  in  surface  and  drinking  waters  of  a  large  metropolitan  city. 
The  selected  study  site was a portion of  the Chattahoochee River  and one of  its  tributary 
streams, Big Creek, located north of Atlanta, Georgia. 

To  the best of our knowledge,  this  is currently  the most extensive study conducted  in  the 
United  States  and  the  only  one  that  provides  information  on  the  occurrence  of  the 
selected  chemicals  in  a  river  system  and  in  the  treatment  processes.  Again  the  findings 
are  alarming  since  a  substantial  number  of OWCs  and  pharmaceuticals were  detected  in 
finished  drinking  water  at  comparable  concentrations  to  those  found  in  the  river  system 
before drinking water treatment plant uptakes. 

Reported Occurrences of the Selected Organophosphates 

Drinking Water 

Reports  of  occurrence  of  the  selected  organophosphates  exist  from  as  early  as  1979  in  a 
national  survey  of  Canadian  drinking  water.  The  concentrations  reported  were  0.2  to  62 
ng/L  for  TBP,  1.1  to  560  ng/L  for  TBEP  and  0.3  to  13.8  ng/L  for  TCEP  (HSDB 
Database, 2003). 

Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. 

7 

All three of the selected organophosphates have been identified as present in the drinking 
water at the CDC survey. 

Surface Waters 

TBP  has  been  reported  in  surface  waters  in  the  U.S.  (CDC,  2000),  Japan,  Spain,  Italy, 
Germany,  Switzerland,  and  the  U.K.  (HSDB  Database,  2003).  Reported  concentrations 
are below the level of 1 µg/L. 

TBEP  has  been  reported  in  surface  waters  in  the  U.S.  (Kolpin  et  al.,  2002).  Reported 
concentrations are up to a few micrograms per liter. 

TCEP has been reported in surface waters in the U.S. (Kolpin et al., 2002). 

Treatment Plant Effluents 

In  a  comprehensive  survey  of  wastewater  from  4000  industrial  and  publicly  owned 
treatment  works  (POTWs)  sponsored  by  the  Effluent  Guidelines  Division  of  the  U.S. 
EPA,  TBP  was  identified  in  various  types  of  industrial  discharge.  The  maximum 
industrial effluent concentrations were 13.5 ppm in the organics and plastics industry and 
10.0 ppm in the paint and ink industry (HSDB Database, 2003). 

Groundwater 

TBP  and  TCEP  have  been  reported  present  in  the  groundwater  at  concentrations  up  to 
200 ng/L in the U.S, Spain, and the Netherlands (HSDB Database, 2003).

Detailed Description of Selected Phosphate Esters 

An  extensive  knowledge  of  the  properties,  manufacture,  and  uses  of  the  compounds  is 
essential  to  developing  an  understanding  of  their  presence  in  the  environment.   With  an 
in-depth understanding of the physical and chemical properties, analysis of possible sinks 
in  the  environment  becomes  possible.    Insight  into  the  manufacture  and  use  of  the 
compounds is necessary to evaluate the loads on the environment. 

The  three  compounds  being  studied  are  tributyl  phosphate,  tri(2-butoxyethyl)  phosphate 
and  tri(2-chloroethyl)  phosphate.  They  are  members  of  the  phosphate  ester  family  of 
chemicals, which are the most predominant phosphate-containing flame retardants in use. 
Organophosphate  flame  retardants  represent  twenty  percent  of  the worldwide  production 
of  flame  retardants  (Environmental  Health  Criteria-192,  1997). 
In  general,  the 
organophosphate flame retardants work by breaking down into phosphoric acid and other 
components  upon  heating.    The  phosphoric  acid  forms  a  char  on  the  surface  of  the 
material  being  burned,  thus  shielding  the  substance  from  being  burned  by  the  heat  and 
stopping  the  release  of  volatiles  being  combusted.    In  addition,  free  radicals  are  formed 
and  released  into  the  vapor  phase.    The  free  radicals  compete  for  the  materials  being 
oxidized  in  the  combustion  reaction,  thereby  reducing  the  intensity  of  the  flame 
(Environmental Health Criteria-192, 1997). 

In addition  to  its  flame  retarding capabilities,  these phosphate esters are used  in a variety 
of other distinct ways as described in the following.

Tributyl Phosphate 

Physical Properties 

The  chemical  formula  for  TBP  is  C12H27O4P,  and  its  structure  is  shown  in  Figure  1.  At 
room  temperatures,  TBP  is  a  colorless  and  odorless  liquid.  It  is  non-explosive  and  non­
flammable,  but  rather  breaks  down  before  reaching  its  boiling  point  (Environmental 
Health Criteria–112,  1991). Since we  are primarily  concerned with  the  presence  of  these 
organophosphates  in  water,  a  useful  property  is  maximum  solubility,  which  for  TBP  is 
280  mg/L  A  Henry’s  Law  constant,  defined  as  a  ratio  of  a  chemical’s  equilibrium 
concentration  in  air  and  water  ,  is  used  to  quantify  a  chemical’s  tendency  to  partition 
between  the  two media.   A  low Henry’s Law constant  indicates a strong desire  to remain 
in  the  water  while  a  large  value  would  be  associated  with  highly  volatile  compounds. 
TBP, with  a  vapor  pressure  of  0.00113 mmHg  and Henry’s  Law  constant  of  1.41  x  10-6 
atm-m3/mole  (both  at  20oC)  indicates  that  partitioning  to  the  air  is  not  a  significant 
removal mechanism (SRC, 2003). 

Figure 1  Chemical structure of TBP 

Manufacture and Uses 
TBP is manufactured for use in plastics, floor finishes, hydraulic fluids and ore extraction 
processes,  primarily  for  its  flame  resistant  properties.  TBP  is  manufactured  through  the 
reaction  of  butyl  alcohol  and  phosphorous  oxychloride  (HSDB  Database,  2003).    It  is 
manufactured  under  the  brand  names  Phosflex  4,  Skydrol  LD-4,  Celluphos  4,  and 
Disphamol 1 TBP (Environmental Health Criteria-112, 1991).

Nippon  Chemical  Ind.  Co.  Ltd.  (Chem  Sources,  2003;  Environmental  Health  Criteria– 
112, 1991). 

Our  best  data  concerning  the  amount  manufactured  is  that  in  1985  approximately  2700 ­
4000  tonnes were  produced worldwide  (Environmental Health Criteria–112,  1991). Data 
regarding  the  production  of  phosphorous  oxychloride  states  that  approximately  40,000 
tonnes of phosphorous oxychloride were produced in 2001 (The Innovation Group, Chem 
Profiles, 2003). Since the largest consumers of phosphorous oxychloride are producers of 
phosphate  esters  for  the  plastics  industry,  we  estimate  that  at  least  as  much  as  the  1985 
estimate is in production today (The Innovation Group, 2003).   Therefore we will use the 
1985  production  figure  as  a  lower  bound  for  the  yearly worldwide  production  of TBP  in 
2003. 

TBP  has many  uses,  and we  feel  that  it  is  important  to  have  an  understanding  of  each  of 
these  uses  in  order  to  adequately  evaluate  the  pathways  TBP  takes  before  entering  the 
Chattahoochee River. The majority of TBP (forty to sixty percent) is used in fire-resistant 
hydraulic  fluid  for  aircraft  (Environmental  Health  Criteria–112,  1991).    A  1988  study 
estimated  that  approximately  45,000  aircraft  industry  workers  were  exposed  to  TBP  for 
an  average  of  30  minutes  to  two  hours  per  week  (Environmental  Health  Criteria–112, 
1991).  The  presence  of  several  airports  in  the  Atlanta  vicinity  makes  this  a  probable 
pathway for TBP to enter the wastewater stream. 

The  second most prevalent use of TBP  is  as  a plasticizer  for plastics  and vinyl  resins.    It 
is  a  preferred  plasticizer  due  to  its  dual  capability  as  a  plasticizer  and  flame  retardant  in 
plastics.  Use  in  plastics  is  a  possible  pathway  into  the  environment  as  TBP  can  leach 

Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. 

11 

from  plastics  into  water,  although  this  seems  more  likely  to  occur  through  landfill 
leachate than through wastewater treatment plant outfalls. 

TBP  is  also  used  as  an  antifoaming  agent  in  paper  coatings,  lithographic  inks,  rubber-
based  paint,  and  floor  polishes  (Environmental  Health  Criteria–112,  1991).  Its  use  in 
floor polishes indicates another possible pathway into the water system.  TBP is used less 
predominantly  as  a  solvent  for  cellulose  esters,  lacquers,  and  natural  gums.  It  is  used  in 
the  blending  of material  that  is  difficult  to  dissolve  such  as  lithographic  inks  and  is  used 
in  the  preparation  of  agricultural  herbicides  and  fungicides  (Environmental  Health 
Criteria–112,  1991).  An  interesting,  emerging  use  of TBP  is  in  the  recovery  of  uranium 
ores  from  reactor  products.    This  use  of  TBP  has  become  increasingly  significant  in 
recent years (Thomas et al., 1998; Environmental Health Criteria–112, 1991).   

Health Effects & Toxicity 

The estimated oral lethal dose of TBP is between one ounce and one pint for a 150 pound 
person  (HSDB  Database,  2003).    Most  direct  encounters  with  significant  quantities  of 
TBP  occur  through  dermal  contact  by  airline  mechanics  or  workers  in  TBP  production 
plants.  Skin  irritation  is  reported  in  most  cases  and  headaches  and  dizziness  have  been 
reported due to exposure to TBP vapor  (HSDB Database, 2003). 

Although  there  have  been  no  fatal  effects  to  humans,  animals  poisoned  with  TBP  have 
displayed  neurological  effects  such  as  weakness  and  dyspnea  (difficulty  in  breathing). 
Poisoning  of  rats  with  TBP  resulted  in  pulmonary  edema  (fluid  entering  the  lungs) 
(HSDB Database, 2003). 

TBP’s most dramatic effects are to plant life.  TBP has been shown to increase the drying 
rate  of  leaves  and  plants  exposed  to  TBP  stopped  respiring  (Environmental  Health 
Criteria–112, 1991). 

Drugstore Cowboys, Inc.

The  above  studies  deal  with  levels  of  TBP  far  greater  than  those  identified  in  the  water 
concentrations in the Chattahoochee River.  No data were found concerning the effects of 
prolonged exposure at the levels encountered in the Chattahoochee. 

Tri(2-butoxyethyl) Phosphate 

Physical Properties 

The chemical formula for TBEP  is C18H39O7P, and  its structure  is shown  in Figure 2.   At 
room  temperatures  it  is  a  light-colored,  viscous  fluid with  an  odor  of  butyl.    It  is  a  high-
boiling and non-flammable substance (Environmental Health Criteria–218, 2000). TBEP, 
with  a  vapor  pressure  of  2.5  x  10-8 mmHg  and Henry’s Law  constant  of  1.2  x  10-11  atm-
m3/mole  (both  at  20oC)  would  indicate  that  partitioning  to  the  air  is  not  a  significant 
removal  mechanism.  This  is  further  evidenced  by  TBEP’s  relatively  large  solubility  in 
water,  1100  mg/L  (SRC,  2003)  TBEP  has  the  potential  for  a  high  level  of  sorption  to 
suspended  sediment  in  the  river  system  due  to  its  high  organic  carbon  partition 
coefficient,  which  is  reported  as  a  log  Koc  of  4.38  (Environmental  Health  Criteria–218, 
2000).

Manufacture and Uses 

Tri(2-butoxyethyl)  phosphate  is  manufactured  for  use  in  floor  polishes  and  as  a 
plasticizer  in  rubbers  and  plastics,  primarily  for  its  flame  resistant  properties.    TBEP  is 
manufactured  through  the  reaction  of  butoxyethanol  and  phosphorous  oxychloride  and 
stripping  hydrochloric  acid  in  excess  of  butoxyethanol  (Environmental  Health  Criteria– 
218,  2000).  It  is  manufactured  under  the  brand  names  Kronitex  KP-140,  KP-140, 
Phosflex  T-BEP,  Phosflex  176C,  and  Amgard  TBEP  (Environmental  Health  Criteria– 
218, 2000). 

Manufacturers  include  City  Chemical  LLC,  Pfletz  &  Bauer  Inc.,  Akzo  Nobel,  Acros

Akulu  Marchon  Ltd,  Blagden  Chemical  Specialties  Ltd.,  and  NBS  Biologicals  Ltd. 
(Chem Sources, 2003). 

Our  best  data  concerning  the  amount  manufactured  is  that  in  2000  approximately  6000 
tonnes were produced worldwide  (Environmental Health Criteria–218, 2000). These data 
are recent enough that we will use it as our estimate for the yearly environmental load. 

TBEP  has  many  particular  uses  and  we  feel  it  is  important  to  have  an  understanding  of 
each  of  these  in  order  to  adequately  evaluate  the  pathways  TBEP  takes  to  enter  the 
Chattahoochee River. The most likely pathway TBEP takes into the wastewater system is 
through  its  use  in  floor  polishes.  TBEP  adds  elasticity  and  gloss  to  floor  polishes.  The 
increased  elasticity  increases  the  leveling  and  spreading  properties  of  the  polish.    It  is  a 
component of  several household  floor polishes,  including such  familiar names as Mop & 
Glo  and  Brilliance,  in  concentrations  as  high  as  eight  percent  (Household  Products 
Database,  2003).  Disposal  of  wastewater  after  floor  polishing  is  an  obvious  pathway  to 
municipal wastewater systems.

TBEP is also used as an antifoam agent and solvent for complex organic compounds such 
as  resins,  waxes,  poly  acrylites,  and  acrylic  copopolymers  (Environmental  Health 
Criteria–218,  2000).  However  these  are  highly  specialized  functions  and  probably 
represent an insignificant amount of the TBEP that escapes to the river system. 

TBEP  is  used  as  a  plasticizer  in  specialty  rubber  used  in  seals,  gaskets,  hoses,  and  shoe 
laces.  Leaching  of  TBEP  from  these  items,  especially  hoses,  could  present  a  significant 
pathway  into  the  river  system.    Its  use  as  a  plasticizer  in  rubber  seals  has  resulted  in  the 
previous contamination of blood samples  (HSDB Database, 2003) and  is worth noting  in 
order to avoid contamination of proposed river water samples. 

TBEP  has  been  detected  in  dust  in  offices  in  the  United  States  at  concentrations  of 
approximately 15 ng/m3. It is estimated that as many as 200,000 office workers have been 
exposed  to  TBEP  through  the  inhalation  of  office  dust  (Environmental  Health  Criteria– 
218, 2000). 

Health Effects & Toxicity 

The  effect  of  TBEP  on  humans  has  been  only  sparsely  examined,  with  very  few  studies 
dedicated  to  long  term  exposure.   One  dermatology  study  did  demonstrate TBEP  to  be  a 
mild  skin  irritant  (HSDB Database,  2003). However  significant  testing  has  been  done  to 
determine  its  non-human  toxicity.    Among  other  effects  it  has  been  found  to  reduce  the 
production  of  red  blood  cells  in  rats  and  chickens  (Environmental  Health  Criteria–218, 
2000).  No  studies  have  been  performed  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  chronic  exposure,  long 
term toxicity, or carcinogenetity.  Considering this it is possible that the chronic exposure 
through drinking water could have detrimental effects.

Tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate 

Physical Properties 

The  chemical  formula  for  TCEP  is  C6H12Cl3O4P  and  its  structure  is  shown  in  Figure  3. 
At  room  temperatures  it  is  a  clear,  colorless  liquid  with  a  slight  odor.    It  decomposes  at 
temperatures  above  220oC.  (Environmental  Health  Criteria–209,  1998)  TCEP  has  a 
maximum  solubility  in  water  of  8000  mg/L.    In  order  to  analyze  the  magnitude  of  loss 
from the river system to the atmosphere we note the vapor pressure of .0613 mmHg and a 
Henry’s  Law  constant  of  3.29  x  10-6  atm-m3/mole  (SRC,  2003).  TCEP,  with  a  vapor 
pressure of 0.0613 mmHg and Henry’s Law constant of 3.29 x 10-6 atm-m3/mole (both at 
20oC) would  indicate  that  partitioning  to  the  air  is  not  a  significant  removal mechanism. 
This is further evidenced by TCEP’s large solubility in water, 8000 mg/L (SRC, 2003).

Manufacture and Uses 

Tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate  is manufactured  for use as a  fire  retardant and plasticizer  in 
liquid  unsaturated  polyester  resins  and  PVC  and  as  a  fire  resistant  back  coating  for

TCEP  production  was  at  its  height  in  the  late  1980’s,  peaking  at  9000  tonnes  a  year  in 
1989.  However,  since  then  its  demand  has  steadily  declined  due  to  its  propensity  to 
decompose  and  it  has  been  replaced  with  other  phosphate  ester  flame  retardants 
(Environmental  Health  Criteria–209,  1998).    The  latest  figures  we  were  able  to  obtain 
regarding  its  current  production  is  below  4000  tonnes  in  1997  (Environmental  Health 
Criteria–209, 1998).  However even with declining use it is still the most prevalent of the 
flame retardants being studied here. 

TCEP  has  many  uses  and  we  feel  it  is  important  to  have  an  understanding  of  each  of 
these  in  order  to  adequately  evaluate  the  pathways  TCEP  takes  to  enter  the 
Chattahoochee  River.  TCEP  has  several  uses  that  provide  ready  pathways  into  the 
municipal  wastewater  stream.    TCEP  is  used  as  fire  retardant  in  liquid  unsaturated 
polyester resins (Environmental Health Criteria–209, 1998).  The normal concentration is 
two  to  five  percent  in  these  resins.  (Jiangdu  Dajian  Chemical  Factory,  2003)  The  resins 
are used in the casting of bathtubs, spas, and pipes.  It is possible that leaching from these 
surfaces could provide a pathway into the environment. 

An  even  more  likely  source  is  the  use  of  TCEP  as  a  back-coating  for  textiles  used  in 
(Environmental  Health  Criteria–209,  1998). 
furniture  and  protective  clothing 

Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. 

17 

Maintenance  and  cleaning  of  these  products  and  subsequent  disposal  of  the  wastewater 
used in the process could provide a pathway to the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).   

TCEP  is  also  used  in  cellulose  ester  compounds  and  coatings  (Environmental  Health 
Criteria–209,  1998)  that  are  used  for  sampling  filters  and  photographic  film.    However, 
we  estimate  that  this  represents  an  insignificant  percentage  of  the  TCEP  that  ends  up  in 
the wastewater stream. 

Historical use of TCEP was  as  a  flame-retarding  component of  rigid polyurethane  foams 
(Environmental  Health  Criteria–209,  1998).    The  decomposition  of  TCEP  caused  the 
discontinuation of this chemical as a flame-retardant.  The use of rigid polyurethane foam 
in  insulation  for  refrigerators  and  houses  requires  that  it  be  rather  long  lived.   Drugstore 
Cowboys,  Inc.  estimates  that  its  use  in  these  products  began  to  decline  after  1989  as 
represented  by  it  falling  off  its  peak  in  that  year.    It  is  quite  feasible  that  a  substantial 
amount of this foam is still in use and this could be a major source to the river system.  In 
fact,  similar  to TBEP, TCEP has been detected  in household dust  (Environmental Health 
Criteria–209, 1998).  This could likely be from the decomposition of these foams.  

Health Effects & Toxicity 

In  tests  regarding  bioconcentration, TCEP was  found  to  accumulate  in  the  brains  of  rats, 
and  with  repeated  exposure  was  found  to  have  adverse  effects  on  the  brain,  liver,  and 
kidneys.  It  is  also  known  to  adversely  affect  the  reproduction  rates  of  rats  and  mice 
(HSDB Database, 2003). 

As with TBEP, few studies have been conducted to identify health effects to humans as a 
result of TCEP exposure. Given that there is no toxicological data for the effects of TCEP 
on humans, TCEP is not classified a carcinogen.  The fact that it is not classified does not 
clear us of danger and  in our opinion  the fate and  transport of TCEP should be studied  in 
order to have the maximum information on it in the event that future toxicological studies 
reveal detrimental health effects as the result of TCEP exposure.

Chattahoochee River Characteristics 

The  Chattahoochee  River  originates  in  Union  County,  Georgia,  just  south  of  the 
Tennessee  border.  The  river  traverses  Georgia  in  a  southwestwardly  direction,  passing 
the  city  of Atlanta,  comprising  a  portion  of  the Alabama-Georgia  border,  and  eventually 
terminating  in  Lake  Seminole  along  the  Georgia-Florida  border.    The  Chattahoochee 
River extends a  total of 698 kilometers, draining a basin of 22,714. square kilometers, 70 
percent of which lies in the state of Georgia (GDNR, 1997).   

The basin climate is typical for its latitude and longitude, with temperatures ranging from 
4oC  in  the  winter  to  27oC  in  the  summer,  and  an  average  annual  precipitation  of  138 
centimeters  (Stamey, 1998).   A majority of  the Chattahoochee River Basin  is covered by 
forestland,  with  the  exception  of  the  more  urbanized  landscape  as  the  river  passes  the 
metropolitan area of Atlanta.   

The  reach  of  river  upon which  the Centers  for Disease Control  chose  to  focus  lies  in  the 
Upper  Chattahoochee  River  Basin,  originating  at  Buford  Dam  and  meandering 
approximately 77 kilometers south to the City of Atlanta water works facility, located just 
north  of  downtown  Atlanta,  at  the  mouth  of  Peachtree  Creek  (see  Figure  4).    Two 
hydroelectric dams are located within this reach.  The first, Buford Dam, is located at the 
most  upstream  boundary  of  the  reach  and  creates  Lake  Sydney  Lanier.  Lake  Lanier  is 
over  190  square  kilometers  and  stores  close  to  3  cubic  kilometers  of  water  (GDNR, 
1998).  The  Morgan  Falls  Dam  is  located  approximately  56  kilometers  down  stream  of 
Buford  Dam.  Morgan  Falls  dam  creates  the  smaller,  Bull  Sluice  Lake  reservoir,  which 
covers  an  area  of  around  2.4  square  kilometers  and  has  no  significant  storage  (GDNR, 
1998). 
In  addition  the  reach  contains  a  designated  national  recreation  area, 
Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area, which  is a popular  trout fishing hole and 
water sport destination.

In  addition  to  a  source  of  hydroelectric  energy,  The  Chattahoochee  River  serves  as  the 
main  source  of municipal  drinking water  for more  than  2 million  people  in metropolitan 
Atlanta.    The  river  and  its  tributaries  also  receive  treated  sewage  effluent  from  local 
wastewater  treatment  plants.   Thirteen municipal drinking water  treatment  plants  use  the 
river  or  its  tributaries  as  source  water,  and  seventeen  municipal  wastewater  treatment 
plants  discharge  effluent  into  one  of  the  rivers  in  the  watershed.  Four  drinking  water 
intakes  lie  downstream  of  a  wastewater  outfall  with  the  result  that  a  substantial 
percentage of  the drinking water originates  from wastewater  (CDC, 2000).    It  is  this  fact 
that makes this reach of the Chattahoochee River suitable for this examination.   

To  produce  the  data  set  that  was  the  impetus  for  this  study,  the  CDC  collected  water 
samples  in  this  reach  of  the  Chattahoochee.    The  sample  set  was  made  up  of  samples 
taken  in  the  effluent  streams  of  four wastewater  treatment  plants,  downstream  of  a  fifth, 
at  the  intakes  of  three  drinking  water  treatment  plants,  and  of  finished  water  from  these 
same  three  plants.    Each  sampling  location  was  sampled  three  separate  times  and  each 
sample  was  analyzed  for  the  three  phosphate  esters  being  studied  here.    The  results, 
although indicating the consistent presence of the selected organophosphate esters, varied 
greatly  in  magnitude.    Still  the  data  was  used  to  construct  a  first  approximation  mass 
balance. 

A “black box” mass balance must be constructed before  the natural attenuation processes 
can be considered as a means of determining  the fate of  the  three phosphate esters  in  this 
stretch  of  the  Chattahoochee  River.  The  initial  “black  box”  mass  balance  is  only 
concerned  with  bookkeeping  the  major  sources  (wastewater  treatment  plant  discharges) 
and  sinks  (water  treatment  plant  intakes)  of  the  organophosphate  pollutants.  Missing 
mass identified in this accounting indicates the possible location and magnitude of natural 
organophosphate  sinks.    The  information  will  be  used  to  focus  later  research  on  only 
those mechanisms likely to cause the observed discrepancies.  Four features must be well 
understood in order to create this balance: the flow rates of the river, its tributary inflows, 
the 
location  of  wastewater  discharges  and 
the  concentration  of 
the 
three 
organophosphates in the discharges

Figure 4: CDC test sites along Chattahoochee River (CDC, 2000) 

Flow exiting Buford Dam averages about 57 cubic meters per second, but  the  fluctuation 
is  considerable,  owing  to  the  hydropower  production  schedule.    Figure  5  highlights  the 
typical oscillation experienced in daily discharge from Buford Dam. 

Flow  data  were  collected  at  all  points  along  the  Chattahoochee  River  and  its  tributaries 
where  the  USGS  has  stream  gages  set  up  and  monitored  (See  Appendix  A  for  map). 
Most  of  these  stream  gages  are well  established;  flow  records  date  back  several  decades 
in  some  instances.    To  complete  the  mass  balance,  the  average  flow  for  the  month  of 
January  was  recorded,  as  this  is  the  best  estimate  of  flow  rates  to  be  expected  when 
experiments are to be conducted in January 2004.

Figure 5: Typical discharge profile for Buford Dam (USGS, 12/03/2003) 

An  average  concentration  for  each  organophosphate,  in  each  treated  effluent  stream 
entering  the  river,  was  computed  from  the  concentrations  detected  in  the  three  samples 
taken  in  the effluent  stream.    The average effluent concentration was  then coupled with 
typical  discharge  rates  for  each  of 
the  wastewater 
treatment  plants 
to  yield 
approximations  of  the  amount  of  each  compound  entering  the  Chattahoochee  River. 
Drinking  water  treatment  plant  intake  concentrations  were  determined  within  the  river 
itself,  allowing  downstream  concentrations  to  be  compared  with  loadings  from WWTPs 
upstream.    The  comparison  resulted  in  estimates  of  compound  mass  removed  between 
recording  stations  (See  Appendix  A  for  a  chart  depicting  concentration  approximations 
within  the Chattahoochee River).   Knowing  the  approximate  amount missing  enables  an 
analysis of which degradation processes are capable of such removal. 

Further  analysis  will  seek  to  enhance  the  “black  box”  model,  attempting  to  prepare  a 
more  complete  water  balance  in  conjunction  with  the  organophosphate  balance  so  as  to 
better  understand  the  organophosphate  concentrations  downstream  of  the  wastewater 
treatment  plants  and  throughout  the  test  section  of  river.    This  will  involve  the 
incorporation  of  rainfall,  evaporation,  land  runoff,  and  groundwater  flux  models.  This 
will allow a more precise estimate of  the magnitude of  the organophosphate sinks, which 
will  presumably  be  identified  through  our  study  of  the  natural  degradation  mechanisms 
undergoing organophosphate removal in the Chattahoochee River.

Presence of Phosphate Esters in Chattahoochee River 
System 

The  CDC-USGS  survey  of  the  treatment  plants  along  the  Chattahoochee  River  revealed 
the  significant  presence  of  phosphate  esters.    Tributyl  phosphate,  tri(2-butoxyethyl) 
phosphate,  and  tri(2-chloroethyl)  phosphate  were  consistently  present  in  detectable 
concentrations.  A summary of the detections in this data set is displayed in Figure 6.

Although  it  is clear  from  the histogram  that  the number of detections  is  reduced between 
the  wastewater  effluent  and  the  drinking  water  intakes,  the  data  suggest  that 
contamination  by  these  phosphate  esters  is  not  completely  removed  by  drinking  water 
treatment.  For  this  reason we  feel  it  is  important  to  understand more  thoroughly  the  fate 
and transport of these compounds.

Major Point Sources 

The  CDC  survey  tested  for  concentrations  of  various  compounds  contained  in 
pharmaceuticals  and  household  products.  The  tests  were  conducted  at  the  outfalls  of 
wastewater  treatment  plants,  at  the  intakes  of  drinking  water  treatment  plants,  and  in 
samples of  the  finished drinking water  from DWTP.   The municipal water  system  plants 
are  set up along  the  river  in  such a way  that  the DWTP  intakes are downstream  from  the 
WWTP outfalls.  See Figure 4 for locations. 

The  data  suggest  that  detectable  concentrations  of  the  three  phosphate  esters  are making 
it  through  the WWTP  treatment  and  being  discharged  into  the Chattahoochee River.   To 
some  extent,  the  compounds  are  surviving  the  stretch  of  the  river  between  the  WWTP 
outfalls  and  the DWTP  intakes  and  are  detectable  in  the  drinking water.   Although  non-
point  sources  are  a  possibility,  we  feel  that  the  most  appropriate  way  to  approach  the 
problem is by assuming that the concentrations being provided by the major point sources 
indicated above will be orders of magnitude  larger  than any non-point  source. Therefore, 
the  fate  and  transport  of  the  three  phosphate  esters  can  be  modeled  as  originating  from 
major point sources. 

Recently,  non-point  sources  have  been  suggested  to  be  important  (Frick  and  Zaugg, 
2003).  This  in  the  end  may  prove  to  be  useful,  as  possible  high  concentrations  of  the 
phosphate esters without a major point source can be accounted for. 

Estimated Annual Loads 

Given the significant presence of the three phosphate esters, it  is important to estimate an 
annual  load  to  the  Chattahoochee  River  system  of  each  chemical.    Drugstore  Cowboys, 
Inc.  used  an  estimated  annual  production  of  6000  tonnes/year  for  TBEP  and 
approximately  4000  tonnes/year  for  both  TCEP  and  TBP.  Given  an  approximate 
population  for  the  area  being  studied  of  2.8  million  (US  Census  Bureau,  2003)  and 
assuming  that  the  majority  of  the  compounds  are  used  in  the  United  States  (population 

Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. 

24 

approximately  280  million)  Drugstore  Cowboys,  Inc.  can  come  up  with  an  approximate 
annual  load  for  each  of  the  compounds  on  the  Chattahoochee  River  system.    For  these 
calculations, Drugstore Cowboys,  Inc. assumed  that 50% of  the worldwide production of 
these  compounds  is  used  in  the  United  States.  An  example  of  the  calculations  done  to 
estimate the annual load is displayed here 

•  TBEP: ((3000 tonnes/year) / 280,000,000 persons)  * 2,800,000 persons in 
area = 30 tonnes / year 

With  these  calculations,  Drugstore  Cowboys,  Inc.  determined  an  estimated  annual  load 
for  the  other  two  compounds  being  studied  of  20  tonnes/year  for  TBP  and  TCEP.    The 
annual  average  daily  flow  of  the  Chattahoochee  River  at  (gaging  station)  is  (value)  cfs 
(USGS,  2003).  Thus,  a  rough  estimate  of  the volumetric  flow  rate of  the Chattahoochee 
River is 20 x 108 cubic meters per year with a mass of 20 x 108 tonnes per year. Thus, the 
approximate  concentration  of  TBP  and  TCEP 
in 
the  Chattahoochee  River 
is 
approximately  1  part  per  108,  or  10  parts  per  billion.  Even  though  the  concentrations 
measured  by  the  CDC  ranged  from  approximately  100  parts  per  trillion  to  two  parts  per 
billion,  the  above  analysis  overestimates  the  actual  values  because  it  assumes  that  all 
phosphate  ester  produced  that  year  also  became  waste  in  the  same  year.  If  only  five 
percent  of  the  phosphate  ester  produced went  into waste,  then  this  analysis would match 
up well with the actual concentrations. 

In  addition,  we  expect  that  the  concentration  of  TBEP  will  be  relatively  higher  than 
predicted  because  its  use  in  household  cleaners  provides  an  easy  access  pathway  to  the 
municipal WWTP.  We expect  the TCEP  loads  to be somewhat higher due  to  its past use 
in  polyurethane  foams  that  are  probably  still  in  use  today.    TCEP  should  also  display 
higher  relative  concentrations  due  to  its  past  production  peak  of  9000  tonnes/year, 
leading  us  to  believe  that  there  is  a  more  substantial  amount  of  it  still  present  in  the 
population. 

Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. 

25 

The  CDC  data  seem  to  agree  with  our  predicted  annual  loads.    The  graph  in  Figure  7 
displays  the  average  of  the  detected  concentrations  for  the  three  compounds.    As 
expected,  TBEP  concentrations  were  the  highest  followed  by  TCEP.    TBP  displays  the 
lowest  concentration  due  to  its  use  in  specialized  industry. However,  it  is  still  likely  that 
some  will  be  disposed  of  improperly;  this  is  represented  by  the  concentrations  we 
observe.

Missing Mass 

From  the  histogram  above,  it  is  apparent  that  a  sink  exists  between  the  WWTP  outfalls 
and the DWTP intakes.  Identification of this sink is of major importance to determine the 
fate  of  the  missing  mass  in  the  environment.    Determining  the  nature  of  the  sink  in  the 
Chattahoochee  River  system  could  also  lead  us  to  identify  a  drinking  water  treatment 
process  most  effective  in  removing  phosphate  esters.    Since  drinking  water  treatment 
processes tend to mimic natural attenuation processes, we feel this is of major importance 
considering that drinking water treatment appears ineffective at removing the compounds 
at the concentrations present in the Chattahoochee River.

Possible Fates of the Phosphate Esters 

There are many possible ways that the phosphate esters can disappear in the aquatic 
environment. These include: 

- Volatization

-
Sorption to sediment 

-
Photodegradation 

- Hydrolysis 

- Bioaccumulation 

- Biodegradation 


Whether  any  of  these  ways  can  affect  the  disappearance  rate  of  the  phosphate  esters  is 
discussed below. 

Volatization 

From (SRC, 2003), the Henry’s Law constant for TBP is 1.5 x 10-7 atm-m3/mol, and 1.2 x 
10-11
  atm-m3/mol  for  TBEP.  This  corresponds  to  negligible  amounts  of  loss  to  the 
atmosphere  from surface waters.   However, for TCEP,  the Henry’s Law constant  is 3.3 x 
10-6 atm-m3/mol, which can result in an appreciable amount of volatilization.  SRC states 
that  the  half-life  of  TCEP  in  a  model  river  (1  meter  deep,  flowing  1  m3/sec  with  a 
velocity of 3 meter/second) is approximately 20 days.  Since this is an order of magnitude 
greater  than  the  residence  time  in  the  river  between  the WWTP  outfalls  and  the  DWTP 
intakes  we  will  assume  that  we  can  neglect  as  a  significant  sink  of  TCEP.  (NOTE:  this 
assumes  the  residence  time  in  Bull  Sluice  Lake  (at  Morgan  Falls)  is  also  <<  than  20 
days).

Sorption 

Chemicals dissolved in water may partition to solid surfaces encountered during transport 
in  the  fluid  system.    Organic  compounds  tend  to  have  an  affinity  to  partition  to  organic 
carbon.  The  ratio  according  to  which  the  chemical  partitions  between  the  solid  and 
aqueous phase is described by a partition coefficient. 

In  addition  to  dissolved  compounds,  rivers  tend  to  carry  solids  suspended  in  water. 
Suspended  solid  particles  may  contain  organic  carbon  and  dissolved  organics  can 
partition  onto  the  organic  carbon.    Once  sorbed  to  the  surface  of  these  particles  the 
particles  can  become  a  sink  for  the  compound  by  settling  out  of  the  flow  and  depositing 
the chemicals on the riverbed. 

The partition coefficient for phosphate esters to organic carbon, Koc, can be approximated 
using  their  partition  coefficient  between  octanol  and  water,  Kow,  and  the  following 
equation (Hemond and Fechner-Levy, 2000): 

 

Log K oc = 0.544 log Kow + 1.377 

The  organic  carbon  partition  coefficients  for  TBP,  TBEP,  and  TCEP  are  listed  below, 
where  only  an  octanol-water  coefficient was  available  (TBP, TCEP),  the  above  equation 
was used to approximate K oc. 

•  Log Koc, TBP  = 3.55 (Environmental Health Criteria, 112) 
•  Log Koc, TBEP = 4.38 (Environmental Health Criteria, 218) 
•  Log Koc, TCEP = 2.30 (Environmental Health Criteria, 209)


.  

The  amount  of  each  compound  that  partitions  to  the  organic  carbon  is  given  by  the  

equation 

Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. 

28 

Cwater * foc* Koc = Cs 

Where Cwater is the concentration in water, foc is the percentage by mass of organic carbon 
in  the  suspended  particles,  and  Cs  is  the  concentration  of  phosphate  ester  sorbed  to 
suspended solids.  A fair estimate of the amount of organic carbon in particles suspended 
in the Chattahoochee is 1% (Hemond and Fechner-Levy, 2000).   

To calculate  the  sorbed concentration  for  each  compound,  the  assumption of  equilibrium 
is  used.  Using  this  value  we  will  estimate  the  annual  sorbed  mass  of  the  compound  by 
multiplying  this  value  by  the  annual  sediment  load  in  the  river.   We  assume  this  process 
does  not  reach  equilibrium  due  to  constant  fluctuation  in  stream  flow  and  WWTP 
discharge  rate;  this  estimated  value  most  likely  overestimates  the  sorbed  mass. 
Therefore, we will regard this value to be an order of magnitude estimate (e.g. a factor of 
ten). 

Two USGS stream gages measure  turbidity  in  the Chattahoochee River system above  the 
DWTP  intakes  at  Atlanta:  one  at  Norcross  upstream  from  the  confluence  of  the 
Chattahoochee  and  the Crooked Creek,  and  one  at Crooked Creek where  it  runs  into  the 
Chattahoochee  at  Norcross.  The  USGS  records  turbidity  in  NTU,  and  we  used  the 
approximate  conversion  1  NTU  =  1  mg/L  suspended  solid  to  convert  from  turbidity  to 
suspended solid. 

The  Chattahoochee  gage  at  Norcross  recorded  a  mean  of  178  mg/L  suspended  solid  in 
2002,  and  the  Crooked  Creek  gage  recorded  a  mean  of  261  mg/L  of  suspended  solid. 
Taking  into  account  the  average  flows  recorded  at  these  gages,  a  total  of  181  mg/L  of 
solids  are  suspended  in  the  Chattahoochee  below  the  confluence  with  Crooked  Creek. 
An  average  streamflow  at  the  Roswell  gage  downstream  from  the  confluence  of  the 
Chattahoochee  and  Crooked  Creek  is  58,000  Liters  per  second.  Therefore  according  to 
the  average measurements  listed  above,  4  x  108  kg  of  suspended  solid  per  year  pass  this 
point  in  the  river. This, multiplied by  the  sorbed  concentration, gives  an  estimate of how 
much of each phosphate ester is lost to the suspended sediment.

The  Chattahoochee’s  River  regime  is  controlled  by  the  upstream  hydroelectric  plant  at 
Burford  Dam.  The  power  plant  is  operated  for  a  few  hours  per  day,  leading  to  artificial 
flooding  events  in  the  river.  The  flow  is  therefore  controlled  by  the  propagation  of  this 
diurnal flood events cycle. Consequently, the concentration of contaminants in the river is 
unsteady  spatially  and  temporarily  due  to  the  above  flood  events.  All  of  the  existing 
measurements were taken at low-flow season, and at times that wastewater accounted for 
a  large  percent  (~50%)  of  the  total  flow.  These  concentrations  cannot  be  readily 
transformed  to  an  equivalent  average  concentration  due  to  the  lack  of  knowledge  of  the 
input  loads  for  every  WWTP.  In  our  calculations  we  will  use  an  estimated  effective 
average  concentration  of  the  order  of  0.5  µg/l  because  the  sediment  suspension  and 
transport probably occurs when the flood waves are propagated downstream. 

Therefore,  according  to  these  assumptions,  7.2  tonnes  TBP/year,  48  tonnes  TBEP/year, 
and  that 0.4  tonnes TCEP/year  are  lost  to  sorption  in  the Chattahoochee River. As  stated 
above,  the  assumptions  lead  to  overestimation  of  sorbed mass.   We  can  assume  that  this 
estimation  is  at  least  an  order  of  magnitude  too  large.    Extensive  experimental 
measurements  must  be  made  to  more  accurately  quantify  this  sink,  but  our  analysis 
clearly shows that sorption is a major potential sink for the phosphate esters. 

Photodegradation 

Direct Photodegradation 

Direct  photodegradation  is  the  process  where  chemical  compounds  absorb  light  and 
undergo transformations.  

For  the phosphate esters of  interest, Drugstore Cowboys,  Inc. has not been  able  to  locate 
any  published  information  for  the  UV/visible  absorption  spectrum.  Extensive  literature 
review  has  been  made  on  this  subject,  including  searching  through  MIT’s  organic 
compounds  reference  books,  but  no  absorption  spectrum  has  been  found.  The  only 

Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. 

30 

relevant  information  that  we  were  able  to  find  is  a  summary  of  the  UV  spectrum 
absorption for TBP. 

Due  to  their  structure,  phosphate  esters  are  not  expected  to  absorb  light  in  the  visible 
spectrum,  therefore  direct  photodegradation  as  a  sink  will  not  be  accounted  for  in  our 
overall analysis of the fate of the selected phosphate esters in the Chattahoochee River. 

To verify this decision, a simple calculation for the absorbance of light for TBP follows. 
For  wavelength  of  200  nm,  TBP  has  a  molar  extinction  coefficient  of    3.4  x  10-20 
cm2/molecule (Rewick et al. 1986). Beer’s law gives light absorbance:

~1µg/L), we have: A (200 nm)  = 2.31
 
10−

× 

In  addition,  because  the  wavelength  used  above  is  in  the  UV  spectrum  (where  organic 
compounds  typically  exhibit  stronger  absorbance,  it  can  be  argued  that  direct 
photodegradation is not a major sink for the selected phosphate esters. 

Indirect Photodegradation 

Indirect  photodegradation  occurs  in  natural  surface waters  due  to  the  existence  of  highly 
reactive  species  that  are  formed  photochemically  and  go  on  to  degrade  chemical 
compounds.  The  most  important  species  in  indirect  photodegradation  is  the  hydroxyl 
radical,  OH·.  Hydroxyl  radical  is  formed  by  many  processes,  amongst  which  are 
photochemical  production  of  hydrogen  peroxide  H  O 2  and  consequently  disassociation
2 
in two hydroxyl radicals, and the Fenton Reaction. 

Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. 

31 

The highly  reactive hydroxyl  radical  is present  in  surface waters  at  levels of  the order of 
10−16 M ~ 10 -17M   (Hemond  and  Fechner-Levy,  2000;  Schwarzenbach  et  al.,  2003).  Even 
though  these  concentrations  are  very  small  due  to  its  significant  reactivity  it  is  a  major 
source of degradation of chemical compounds in surface waters. 

A  rough  estimation  of  the  half-lives  of  the  selected  phosphate  esters  due  to  degradation 
by  hydroxyl  radical  attack will  be  calculated. All  the  assumptions made  in  the  following 
lead to an underestimation half-lives.  

TBP 

For  the  reaction  of  TBP  with  hydroxyl  radical  there  is  a  known  reaction  rate  of 
k  = 1010  M  sec    (Notre  Dame  Radiation  Laboratory,  2003).    The  reaction  rate  comes 
-1 
-1 
from  the  Radiation  Chemical  Data  Center  at  Notre  Dame  University  and  has  been 
obtained  for pH = 1.2.  It  is known  that hydroxyl  radical has  a  stronger  reaction potential 
in  strongly  acidic  aqueous  solutions  so  any  half-life  calculated  with  this  rate  is  shorter 
than the actual one.

TCEP & TBEP 

To our knowledge  there  is no tabulated reaction rate with hydroxyl radical for TCEP and 
TBEP. In order to estimate a half-life for these compounds, Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. will 
regard  the  reactions  with  hydroxyl  radicals  as  diffusion-limited  reactions  because  the 
eventual half-life found will be the lower bound.

Hydrolysis 

Two  classes  of  pollutants  in  surface waters  are most  likely  to  undergo  hydrolysis. These 
are  the  esters  and  the  alkyl  halides  (Hemond  and  Fechner-Levy,  2000).  In  saturated 
phosphorus  atoms  (ones  without  a  hydrogen  atom  directly  connected  to  the  phosphorus 
atom),  such  as  the  phosphate  esters  Drugstore  Cowboys,  Inc.  is  examining,  the  ester  is 
attacked  by  SN2  nucleophilic  substitution.  This  changes  the  phosphotriester  into  a 
phosphodiester,  and  so  on,  until  the  molecule  turns  back  into  a  phosphate  ion  (Thomas, 
1998).  Alkyl  halides  also  have  SN2  substitution,  where  the  alkyl  halide  turns  into  an 
alcohol.  Alkyl  halides  are  a  much  better  leaving  group  than  the  esters  because  of  the 
stability of the halide ion. Virtually all ester and alkyl halide substitution is caused by the 
hydroxyl  ion  because  it  is  a  much  better  substitution-catalyzer  for  saturated  phosphorus 
atoms  than  H2O.  Thus,  phosphate  ester  hydrolysis  is  usually  characterized  as  a  base-
catalyzed reaction (Schwarzenbach, 2003). 

Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. 

33 

Overall,  hydrolysis  does  not  seem  to  be  a  significant  factor  over  the  time  scales  and  pH 
values for the Chattahoochee River. In Ishikawa and Baba (1988), hydrolysis of TBP and 
TCEP was measured for a range of pH from 2 to 12 and at a reactant concentration of 0.1 
mg/L.  For  TBP,  100%  of  the  chemical  remained  after  one  day  for  all  range  of  pH.  For 
TCEP,  100%  of  the  chemical  remained  after  one  day  for  pH  2  to  8.  At  pH  10,  ~95% 
remained,  and  at  pH  12,  ~40%  remained.  But,  because  the  time  scale  of  river  flow  is 
approximately  one  to  one  and  a  half  days,  and  because  the  pH  of  river  water  seldom 
approaches  basic  values,  hydrolysis  is  not  a  factor  in  the  Chattahoochee  River  for  either 
TBP or TCEP. 

In  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  chemical  testing  of  TBP  (U.S.  EPA,  1989), 
hydrolysis  was  specifically  tested  for  a  period  of  30  days  at  pH  3,  7,  and  11,  using  a 
concentration of 10 mg/L. The average amount remaining was 85.6%, which would mean 
a  half-life  of  approximately  130  days.  In  Brown  et  al.  (1975),  the  estimated  half-life  of 
TCEP  is  100  days,  and  “the  chlorine may  hydrolyze moderately  rapid with  a  half-life  of 
38 days based on  the half-life of ethyl chloride.” This  idea goes back  to  the possible SN2 
nucleophilic  substitution  of  the  ester  group  or  only  substitution  of  the  halogen  group, 
which is in general a better leaving group. No pH values were indicated in this test. 

No  specific  data  could  be  found  for  TBEP,  but  Muir  (1984)  indicates  that  phosphate 
esters  do  not  hydrolyze  at  pH  5-7,  but  are  more  likely  to  degrade  under  more  alkaline 
conditions; therefore, TBEP will most likely follow the same trends discussed above. 

Bioaccumulation 

Bioaccumulation,  or  the  accumulation  of  pollutant  chemicals  in  aquatic  organisms  from 
both  water  and  food,  is  another  potential  sink  for  the  three  organophosphates.    This  can 
present a  serious  risk  to humans and other higher-order organisms  if  substantial amounts 
of  a  harmful  compound  are  ingested  by  a  particular  organism  and  rather  than 
metabolized,  are  concentrated  within  the  organism’s  tissue  lining  or  blood.    A 

Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. 

34 

bioconcentration  factor  (BCF)  is  usually  used  as  a means  of measuring  chemical  uptake 
by  an  organism,  and  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  a  chemical’s  concentration  in  an  organism 
to 
the  chemical’s  aqueous  concentration  (Hemond  and  Fechner-Levy,  2000). 
Considering  only  a  partitioning  model  is  particularly  useful  for  hydrophobic  chemicals 
that  readily  migrate  between  animal  tissue  and  water,  and  is  a  function  of  both  the 
chemical’s octanol-water partitioning coefficient, Kow, and  the fish’s  lipid content.   More 
detailed  kinetic models  are  sometimes  implemented  that  take  into  account  the  dynamics 
of  ingestion,  excretion,  and  other  processes  associated with metabolism  by  the  organism 
(Hemond and Fechner-Levy, 2000). 

 In the Chattahoochee River Basin, a diverse collection of fish fauna exists, with over 104 
species  representing  22  families  observed  (Couch,  1996).  The  largest  number  of  species 
(31)  is  from  the  minnow  family  Cyprinidae,  with  large  numbers  of  sunfishes,  catfishes, 
and  suckers  present  as  well  (Georgia  DNR,  1997).    The  Georgia  Department  of  Natural 
Resources  also  stocks  trout  in  this  section  of  the  Chattahoochee  River  in  support  of 
recreational opportunities in the metropolitan Atlanta area.   

A  small  number  of  experiments  have  been  conducted  to  assess  the  bioconcentration  of 
the  three  phosphate  chemicals  in  various  fish  species.   Killifish  and  goldfish were  tested 
under  TCEP  concentrations  of  a  few  parts  per  million  for  several  days  of  continuous 
exposure  (Sasaki,  1981).  Another  test was  conducted with  killifish  using  concentrations 
on  the  order  of  tens  of  micrograms  per  liter  (CITI,  1992).    Both  tests  resulted  in  a  low 
BCF,  leading  to  the  conclusion  that  the  likelihood  of  bioaccumulation  of  TCEP  is  low. 
Similar results were found for TBEP using a carp species (CITI, 1992).  For TBP, a BCF 
of 190 was determined from an empirical correlation with log Kow, which has a published 
value  of  approximately  4.00.    This  leads  to  a  moderate  potential  for  bioconcentration  in 
aquatic  organisms  (Saeger,  1979).    A  similar  conclusion  was  found  while  studying 
bioconcentration  in  killifish  and  goldfish,  in  which  half-lives  of  58  and  100  hours, 
respectively,  were  observed  (Sasaki,  1981).    Both  of  these  species  metabolize  and 
eliminate  the  phosphate  ester  from  their  systems,  so  observed  BCFs  are  lower  than 
predicted.  In a separate test conducted with carp, high amounts of TBP uptake were also 

Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. 

35 

observed  (CITI,  1992).  From  these  results,  it  can  be  concluded  that  only  TBP  has  the 
potential  for  substantial  removal  from  the  water  column  via  uptake  and  subsequent 
breakdown and/or bioaccumulation. 

Biodegradation 

Biodegradation  involves  the  biological  transformation  of  pollutant  chemicals  into  other, 
usually  less  toxic compounds.   Through successive breakdown, most organic compounds 
are  eventually  reduced  to  water,  inorganic  salts,  and  carbon  dioxide  in  a  process  known 
as  mineralization  (Hemond  and  Fechner-Levy,  2000).    When  supplied  with  appropriate 
nutrients  and  oxygen,  specialized  aerobic  bacteria  can  consume  and  degrade  pollutant 
chemicals as their primary food source.   

Biodegradation  of  TBP  is  believed  to  follow  the  same  intermediate  transformation 
pathway  as  when  chemically  hydrolyzed,  moving  first  to  dibutyl  then  monobutyl 
phosphate  before  converting  into  butanol  and  finally  phosphoric  acid  (Macaskie  and 
Rosenberg,  1991).  A  separate  study  also  determined  that  the  degradation  pathway  for 
phosphate  esters most  likely  includes  a  stepwise  enzymatic hydrolysis  to orthophosphate 
and  the  phenolic  or  alcohol  moieties,  which  themselves  undergo  further  degradation 
(Barret et al., 1969). 

One particular study conducted at the University of Birmingham explored the breakdown 
of  TBP  in  hopes  of  harnessing  the  resultant  enzymatically  liberated  phosphate  as  a 
mechanism  for  precipitating  uranyl  ions  from  aqueous  solution.  (Thomas  and Macaskie, 
1996).  In this experiment, river water taken from the Mersey River at Warrington (U.K.) 
was  diluted with  a  feed  solution  to  eight  percent  by  volume  then  supplied with TBP  at  a 
solution  concentration  of  0.53  g/L  (overall  concentration  of  2  mM)  to  serve  as  the  sole 
carbon and phosphorous source.  The aqueous solution was  then  inoculated with bacteria 
Pseudomonas  and  allowed  to  adjust  to  the  new  medium.    A  moderate  length  lag  phase 
(~2 weeks) was followed by steady TBP consumption of 37 µmol hr-1 mL-1.  Hence, TBP 
was  utilized  for  growth  by  TBP-supplemented  pseudomonad  cultures  (see  Figure  1D  – 
Thomas and Macaskie, 1996).   

Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. 

36 

Pseudomonads were  found  to  be  the most  persistent  bacteria  species when  TBP was  the 
sole  phosphorous  source  (Rosenberg  and Alexander,  1979).   Acinetobacter was  found  to 
respond  in  a  similar  fashion,  although  at  a  slower  rate  (150  µg/mL  TBP  over  28  days) 
(Stoner and Tien, 1995). 

In  a  separate publication,  the  effect of different parameters on TBP biodegradation,  such 
as  temperature,  pH,  and  metal  and  ion  addition,  was  identified  (Thomas  and  Macaskie, 
1997).  Acid-mine drainage water was  treated with  the  same  feed  solution  and presented 
with TBP at  the same concentration as  the previous experiments  (Thomas and Macaskie, 
1996).  Optimal  results  were  found  at  a  temperature  of  30oC  and  pH  of  7,  with  0.48  + 
0.03 mM residual TBP after 50 hours, corresponding to roughly 75 percent TBP removal. 
The presence of sulfate  ions and specific metals such as copper, cadmium, nickel, cobalt, 
and  manganese  either  reduced  or  completely  inhibited  biodegradation.    Also,  the 
introduction of a competing carbon source, such as kerosene (tested because of its role as 
a  diluent  in  nuclear  fuel  processing),  can  severely  reduce  TBP  biodegradation  by 
inhibiting  oxygen  intake  or  trapping  TBP,  thereby  removing  it  as  a  site  for  bacterial 
growth. 

solubility,  octanol-water  partition  coefficient,  and 
in-depth  analysis  of 
An 
biodegradability  was  conducted  for  11  phosphate  esters,  including  TBP  (Saeger,  1979). 
The  study  found  that  five  of  these  compounds,  including  TBP,  underwent  complete 
primary  biodegradation  in  river  die-away  tests  in  less  than  seven  days.    Two  separate 
semi-continuous  activated  sludge  (SCAS)  tests  were  conducted  for  TBP.    In  one  test, 
TBP was added at a rate of 3 mg L-1 24hr-1, with 96 percent biodegradation over 13 days. 
A  second  study,  using  a  feed  rate  of  13  mg  L-1  24hr-1,  yielded  56  +  21  percent 
degradation  over  a  3-week  period,  demonstrating  that  TBP  biodegradation may  increase 
with  decreased  loading.  A  follow-up  CO2  evolution  study  was  undertaken  to  determine 
the  extent  of  biodegradability,  with  almost  all  phosphate  esters  essentially  undergoing 
complete mineralization.    The  study  concluded  that  naturally  occurring mixed microbial 

Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. 

37 

populations  in  surface  waters  will  degrade  commercial  phosphate  esters  such  as  TBP 
(Saeger, 1979).   

Further  studies  by Thomas, Macaskie,  and Dick,  to  be  researched  shortly, will  hopefully 
add  insight  into  the  biodegradability  of  TBP  as  well  as  TBEP  and  TCEP.    A  report 
completed  for  the  time  period  of  spring  1999  to  spring  2000  analyzed  indicator  bacteria 
such  as  Escherichia  coli  (E.  coli)  and  enterococci  in  the  tributary  streams  of  the  Upper 
Chattahoochee  River  and  could  possibly  give  insight  into  bacterial  loading  within  this 
region  (Gregory  and  Frick,  2001).  Given  the  results  of  these  past  toxicological 
experiments,  biodegradation 
is  a  potentially  significant  mechanism  for  natural 
degradation of organophosphates  in  surface waters  and will be one of our  focal points  in 
future studies on the Chattahoochee.

section  area.  The  volumetric  flow  rate  is  2000-3000  cubic  feet  per  second.  The  distance 
traveled  from Buford Dam  to Atlanta  is  48 miles,  and  the  hydraulic  cross-section  area  is 
approximately 1000 square feet. This leads to a residence time of 1-1.5 days. 

Thus,  biodegradation  and  bioaccumulation  seem  to  be  the  major  potential  sinks  in  the 
Chattahoochee  River,  since  the  other  processes  have  considerably  longer  half-lives  than 
the residence time of the river. 

Further  research  that  Drugstore  Cowboys,  Inc.  will  perform  includes  considering  the 
effects  from other minor  sinks,  such  as  recharge  from or discharge  to groundwater. Plus, 
dilution  factors must  be  considered when  sampling  directly  from  the  river  as  opposed  to 
the outfalls of a WWTP.

In Situ Investigation at the Chattahoochee River 

To  examine  more  closely  the  life  cycle  of  the  phosphate  esters,  the  Drugstore  Cowboys 
will  travel  to  Atlanta  in  order  to  supplement  the  CDC-USGS  data  from  the  summer  of 
1999. 

Sampling  sites  will  include  areas  where  the  original  data  were  taken,  but  will  also  have 
sites  that  correspond  to  the  major  potential  natural  sinks  in  the  process.  This  will  most 
likely  include  sites  in  the  Chattahoochee  River  itself,  as  opposed  to  the  outfalls  at 
WWTPs and intakes and finished samples at the DWTPs. Other sites will come within an 
actual DWTP, with  the  intention  of  examining  how DWTP  processes  affect  the  removal 
of  the  phosphate  esters.  Plus,  since  the  CDC-USGS  data  only  took  samples  upstream  of 
Atlanta,  valuable  information  may  also  lie  downstream  of  Atlanta.  These  potential  sites 
are being discussed among the clients and Drugstore Cowboys Inc., in hopes of gathering 
the best data to complement the natural and treatment processes being analyzed. 

Sampling  styles  are  still  being  hashed  out  among  Drugstore  Cowboys  Inc.,  but  will  suit 
the  analytical  method(s)  that  will  detect  the  concentrations  of  phosphate  esters  in  the 
waters.  The  preferred  method  comes  from  (Kolpin  et  al.,  2002),  using  a  whole-water 
continuous liquid-liquid extraction with capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry 
analysis. One major  note  is  that  the method  requires  at  least  one  liter  of  sample  for  each 
analysis, since the concentrations of the phosphate esters are in the order of ng/L. 

Most  costs  of  the  project  will  come  from  the  large  amount  of  sampling  bottles,  the 
analysis  costs,  the  possible  use  of  a  craft  to  move  along  the  Chattahoochee  River,  and 
hotel  fees. Assuming a stay of  two weeks,  the  total cost will most  likely be under $5,000 
for  these  four  items.  Other  fees  will  come  from  travel  expenses,  such  as  transportation 
and food.

Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. Proposed Further Investigation 

Natural Attenuation Processes 

Mathew  Andrews  will  focus  on  the  natural  attenuation  processes  driving  the  removal  of 
the  three  phosphates  in  the  river.    Utilizing  his  expertise  in  environmental  transport 
processes, Mr. Andrews will analyze  the factors  that contribute  to natural degradation. In 
particular,  he  will  focus  on  the  mechanisms  of  sediment  sorption,  bioaccumulation  and 
biodegradation, previously noted to be potential major sinks for phosphate compounds  in 
surface  waters.  Field  testing  along  the  Chattahoochee  River  will  be  conducted  to 
augment his ongoing literature research.   

A  thorough  understanding  of  the  factors  involved  in  the  fate  of  these  compounds  in  the 
surface  water  environment  can  be  incorporated  into  the  modeling  work  of  Mr.  Haffey. 
Additionally, the concepts derived from the natural environment may be applicable in the 
manufactured  water  treatment  system,  which  will  be  the  focus  of  Mr.  Lin’s  work. 
Parallels may  be  drawn  between  the  natural  system  and  the manufactured  water  system, 
which ultimately lead to improvements in water treatment efficiency.   

By  developing  a  logical  justification  for  the  observed  fate  of  flame  retardant  compounds 
in the environment, recommendations can perhaps be made for chemicals which are more 
readily degraded in the surface water environment while maintaining the necessary flame 
retarding capability.

Investigation into a Drinking Water Treatment Plant 

In  addition  to  taking  samples  along  the  Chattahoochee  River,  Joseph  Lin  plans  to  take 
samples in a DWTP or a WWTP. Each of the processes within the plant will be examined 
from  a  chemical  perspective.  For  example,  disinfection  in  a  chemical  plant  involves  the 
use  of  chlorine;  is  there  any  form  of  hydrolysis  within  disinfection  that  may  affect  the 
removal of the phosphate esters? 

Depending on the DWTP that Mr. Lin will have access to, he will examine the chemistry 
of (Adams et al., 2002; Paune et al., 1998): 

- Metal  Salt  Coagulation:  The  use  of  aluminum  sulfate  and  ferric  sulfate  is 
intended  to  coagulate  particles,  but  may  have  different  effects  on  the 
phosphate esters. 
- Lime Softening: The use of soda ash to lower the hardness due to calcium and 
magnesium. Do the extra carbonate molecules promote hydrolysis? 
- Granulated Activated Carbon  and Powdered Activated Carbon Sorption: This 
method is very useful in removal of hydrophobic organic chemicals. 
- Ozonation:  Diffusing  ozone  into  the  waters,  usually  done  as  a  substitution  to 
chlorination. 
Ion exchange: Although used rarely in practice, strong-acid cation and strong-
base anion resins are used. 
- Other processes that may involve chemical removal of the phosphate esters. 

-

Plus, WWTP chemistry involves: 

- Aeration:  Diffusion  of  oxygen,  usually  done  after  the  primary  sedimentation 
stage.  In  some  instances,  phosphate  removal  occurs  depending  on  the  type  of 
bacteria.

-

Polymer/ferric chloride addition: Promotes coagulation. The question is where 
the phosphate esters end up, whether  it  is hydrolyzed, goes  into  the sludge, or 
stays in the water. 
- Chlorination 
- Other processes that may involve chemical removal of the phosphate esters-. 

The samples will most likely be taken at low-flow periods, which depend on the flow 
from the dams upstream of the Chattahoochee River. As noted in the in situ investigation 
section, one-liter samples will be necessary for each analysis. Details of the methodology 
for collecting samples will be determined by the time Mr. Lin travels to Atlanta in 
January 2004.

Computer Model of Phosphate Ester Fate and Transport 

Samuel Haffey will  develop  a  computer model  that  strives  to  predict  the  behavior  of  the 
selected  phosphate  esters  within  the  Chattahoochee  River.    Mr.  Haffey’s  background  in 
computer science makes him the most suitable choice for this portion of the project.  The 
computer model will combine data on specific characteristics of the Chattahoochee River 
with properties of the compounds to predict their behavior.   

A  computer  simulation  modeling  the  fate  and  transport  of  the  phosphate  esters  in  the 
Chattahoochee River  can help describe present water quality  conditions.   The  current  set 
of data gathered by  the CDC  in addition  to data  that will be gathered by  the project  team 
provides  information  on  concentrations  at  specific  points  in  the  system.    The  computer 
simulation  can  help  to  interpolate  between  these  sample  points  and  give  a  greater 
understanding  of  the  concentrations  that  can  be  encountered  at  any  point  along  the  river 
system. 

The model  can  also  serve  to  provide  site-specific  predictions.    The  projected  increase  in 
the production and use of at  least  two of  the phosphate esters being studied  indicates  that 
concentrations may  increase over  the coming years.   A model  is useful  for predicting  the 
effect  that  increased  loads  will  have  on  the  Chattahoochee  River  and  where  we  can 
expect  the  accumulation  of  the  phosphate  esters.  Furthermore,  the  predictions  provided 
by  the model  can  be  extrapolated  to  provide  predictions  on  the  effect  of  phosphate  ester 
loads  on  other  river  systems.    Given  the  pervasive  presence  of  phosphate  esters  in  the 
environment, these extrapolated predictions could prove very useful for further studies.   

Mr. Haffey proposes using the Environmental Protection Agency’s water quality analysis 
code, Water Quality Analysis Simulation Program  (WASP5)  (Ambrose, Wool & Martin, 
1993), to construct the model for the fate and transport of the phosphate ester compounds 
in the Chattahoochee River.  Data from the CDC-USGS survey as well as data the project 
team will collect during January will be used to calibrate the model. 

Drugstore Cowboys, Inc. 

44 

The  WASP5  code  models  the  hydraulic  system  as  a  series  of  control  volumes  linked 
together  through  mixing  processes.    Each  control  volume  represents  a  segment  of  the 
river with  defined  transport,  loading  and  transformation  processes.   The  control  volumes 
are linked together to form a model of the river system. (Ambrose, Wool & Martin, 1993) 

Figure 8 
Graphic Representation of WASP5 Model (Ambrose, Wool & Martin, 1993) 

Using  the  same  kinetic  model  of  the  phosphate  esters  used  in  the  model  of  the 
Chattahoochee  River  discussed  above,  we  propose  to  further  use  the  WASP5  code  to 
model  the  drinking  water  treatment  processes  being  performed  at  the  DWTPs  drawing 
water  from  the  Chattahoochee  River.  This  will  be  achieved  by  defining  the  tanks  in  the 
drinking  water  treatment  process  as  control  volumes  with  no  mixing.    This  model  will 
provide  insight  into ways  of  improving  the  treatment  process  to more  efficiently  remove 
the phosphate esters as well as provide predictions as to how the process will behave with 
varying concentration levels.

Engineering a Viable solution for removal of phosphate esters at DWTPs 

Alexandros  Machairas  will  investigate  the  possibility  of  removal  of  the  selected 
phosphate  esters  at  traditional Drinking Water Treatment Plants with  small alterations of 
existing treatment processes.  

The focus of his research will be on  identifying possible ways of altering existing widely 
used  treatment  processes  with  a  feasible  cost  that  will  provide  substantial  results. 
His preliminary considerations target the chemical degradation of the phosphate esters by 
hydroxyl  radical  attack.  These  considerations  rise  from  the  fact  that  some  of  the 
traditional  disinfection  processes,  like  ozonation  or  ultraviolet  irradiation  can  be  easily 
altered to produce a significant amount of hydroxyl radicals. 

In  order  to  investigate  the  above  possibility,  funding  will  be  required  so  that  necessary 
experiments are performed that will tabulate the reaction rate of hydroxyl radical with the 
phosphate esters of  interest at  relevant pH  levels. The experiments most probably will be 
performed  in a batch  reactor with a known hydroxyl  radical concentration. The hydroxyl 
radical  will  be  produced  through  a  Fenton  reaction,  and  the  phosphate  esters  will  be 
introduced at spiked concentrations. 

The production of hydroxyl  radicals  in  the previously mentioned  treatment processes can 
be  increased  in  many  ways.  For  UV  disinfection,  one  approach  could  be  to  introduce 
H  O 2    that  breaks  down  to  produce  hydroxyl  radicals.  At  ozonation  tanks,  the 
2 
introduction  of  H  O 2    can  increase  the  naturally  occurring  hydroxyl  radicals  and 
2 
therefore  enhance  the  degradation  processes.  Another  solution  is  the  irradiation  of 
ozonation tanks with UV light to enhance the production of hydroxyl radicals. 

In  addition,  Mr.  Machairas  will  do  an  extensive  literature  review  that  will  provide 
necessary  information  for  the  estimation  of  the  degradation  potential  for  the  above 
processes.  For  example,  a  necessary  value  is  the  average  irradiation  intensity  at  UV 
disinfection tanks.

The  goal  of  his  research  will  be  to  explore  the  potential  of  the  above  mentioned 
engineering  solutions  at  addressing  the  emerging  concerns  relating  to  the  occurrence  of 
xenobiotic organic compounds in surface waters and their mitigation to drinking water.
