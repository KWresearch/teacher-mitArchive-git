NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS 
 

The Environment and Public Health Organization (ENPHO), a research institute and 
laboratory located in Kathmandu, Nepal has obtained funding from the United Nations 
Development Program (UNDP) and is seeking a research partner.  During the summer of 2002, 
Environment and Public Health Organization (ENPHO) prepared a document describing specific 
research topic areas and has requested proposals from interested parties to assist in conducting 
drinking water and wastewater treatment technology design and implementation studies during 
2003-2003. The anticipated effort will require up to 3200 hours of technical effort up to 8 
M.Eng. students), leading to a draft final report on March 21, 2003.  Assuming a one-week 
review by sponsors, a final report is due on Friday, May 2, 2003.  In addition, the successful 
team will be expected to make one or more oral presentations to the client and the public. 
To be considered, prospective bidders are asked to forward a letter of intent (LOI) with 
team qualifications to the above address by COB, October 4, 2002. The LOI should be no longer 
than 2 pages, exclusive of resumes, and should outline the team’s preliminary plans for the 
project.  Bidders will be notified by October 11 if they have made the short list, and successful 
bidders will be asked to submit a full technical plus cost proposal by December 6, 2002.  Details 
of the proposal follow. 
 
 
BACKGROUND 
 

Although Nepal is a country rich in fresh water resources, these resources are unevenly 
distributed and water quality is poor.  Water supply coverage is officially 70% in Nepal, 
however, microbial water quality of various supplies – piped, tubewell, stone spouts -- is suspect, 
based on investigations of ENPHO (2000), the MIT Nepal Water Project and others.  Also, for 
many people, getting water year-round is a problem. There is either too much water in the 
monsoon season or too little water during the rest of the year.

Nepal has a serious public health problem on account of poor water quality. 
According to the UNICEF statistics (2000): 
 
•  1 in 10 children in Nepal die before the age of 5. Diarrheal illness causes 44,000 
childhood deaths/year in Nepal making waterborne diseases the leading cause of 
childhood death. 
Infant mortality is 75 per 1,000 live births.  
• 
•  54% of children in Nepal are stunted on account of waterborne diseases. Diarrhea and 
other waterborne diseases mean that children cannot retain nutrients essential to growth.   
•  Life expectancy is 58 years. 
•  Water pollution and scarcity have a particularly strong impact on women’s lives. On 
account of their responsibility caring for sick children and carrying water from distant 
sources, women are prevented from attaining education or economic opportunities.   
 
 
 
PROPOSED WORK 
 
1.  DRINKING WATER SUPPLY 
 
1.1 Rainwater Harvesting 
(Location: Butwal)  
Comparison of Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (RWSSSP) and IDE rainwater 
harvesting systems for rainwater sufficiency (relative to supplying minimum needs) and 
for microbial safety. Consider chlorination or other means of disinfection. (RWSSSP is 
the NGO working in Butwal and environs. They were an excellent host last year, the first 
year we worked with them. They do not have a Web site, but a general introduction to 
RWSSSP can be found in the M.Eng thesis of Yongxuan Gao (2002).) For information 
on IDE’s rainwater harvesting system, see: http://www.ide-
international.org/whatsnew/Newsletter/newsletpg2.htm and http://www.ide-
international.org/whatsnew/Newsletter/newsletpg4.htm 
  
 
1.2. Tubewell Protection and Maintenance 
(Location: Butwal) 
Dye test to assess the disintegration of cow-dung under tubewell platforms. These tests 
might make use of bacteriophages as hygiene indicators, available from the ENPHO 
laboratory in Kathmandu, and following procedures developed by the Swedish Institute 
for Infectious Disease Control. This project would also build on the work of 2001-2002 
M.Eng student, Yongxuan Gao (2002), who determined that the use of cow dung as an 
aid in drilling tubewells was statistically correlated with well contamination. Tubewells 
are the most common means of accessing groundwater supplies in southern Nepal (and 
many other parts of the developing world).  This project would also deepen our  
knowledge and the practical application of the best approaches to tubewell protection and 
maintenance.

1.3 The Bottled Water Industry and Water Vending in Nepal 
(Location: Kathmandu) 
 
One response to polluted and/or scarce water supplies is the development of a bottled 
water and water vending industry. Whereas bottled water is typically sold in 1-3 ml 
polyethylene terephthlate  (PET) plastic bottles, water vending is the sale and distribution 
of water by larger containers, ranging from delivery by tank truck to carrying containers 
by individuals. Bottled water is widely available in Nepal and water vending is present in 
urban areas. This study would involve one M.Eng student, and possible collaboration 
with a Sloan School Global Entrepreneurship-lab student team. The M.Eng project would 
study the bottled water industry/water vending in Nepal.  What is the quality of the 
bottled/vended water? Does it meet World Health Organization guidelines and/or Nepali 
water standards? How much bottled/vended water is being consumed in Nepal and how 
much is exported to other countries? How much are people willing to pay for 
bottled/vended water in Nepal? Who is buying it?  (The American Water Works 
Association (AWWA) says that for the price of one bottle of "boutique" designer water, 
1,000 gallons (3,800 L) could be delivered to homes in the U.S. The National Resources 
Defense Council (NRDC) reports that some people spend up to 10,000 times more per 
gallon for bottled water in the U.S. then they do for tap water. How does this compare 
with Nepal?) 
 
There are a number of bottled water companies in Nepal – Bailley, Thirst-Pi, 
YES, Bisleri.  One company we already have contact with is Himalayan Nara, Natural 
Spring Water.  Himalayan Nara is a Nepali joint venture with 90% ownership by a 
Korean company that produces bottled water for export to countries throughout Asia.  
Nepal provides access to the water in the Himalayas and the employees to operate the 
manufacturing facility.  The Korean company built the manufacturing facility and 
handles facility operations and engineering.  Atul Lal Shrestha indicates that the business 
is well funded and organized.  He continues to search new markets for the water and has 
extensive cost data to make carefully considered decisions on which markets to enter.

1.4 Dug well Improvement Methods and Shock Chlorination  
(Location: Butwal and/or Rautahat) 
Dug wells are the traditional wells in Nepal (and throughout the world), predating the 
now widely used tubewells. Use of dug wells has fallen off sharply where tubewells are 
available. Yet dug wells are being reconsidered as one of the drinking water options for 
people in the Terai region, especially in arsenic-affected areas. Thus many dug wells 
have been rehabilitated by various organizations like the Nepal Red Cross Society, the 
Finnish Aid Organization  (FINNIDA) etc. This project would involve water quality 
testing of dug wells, experiments with shock chlorination, and result in recommendations 
for future maintenance and use.

2. FILTRATION 
 
2.1 *** Priority Project ***  Ceramic Filter Design 
 
A grant has been given by a U.S. family foundation to support the ceramic candle filter 
industry in Nepal. Building on the work of M.Eng student Jason Low (2002), this project 
would work with Hari Govinida of Madyapur Clay Crafts and other colleagues in Nepal 
to come up with an improved ceramic filter design then test that design.  
 
2.2 *** Priority Project *** Biosand Pilot Project 
(Location: Lumbini) 
 
In January 2002, a biosand pilot project was initiated by Lee Hersh and Susan Murcott 
and studied by M.Eng student Heather Lukacs (2002). Currently, about two dozen 
biosand filters are located in households in villages associated with the International 
Buddhist Society programs. This project would test these filters and develop a monitoring 
program. (This project could be linked with topics 2.3 and 2.4) 
 
2.3 Design and Evaluation of a Bench-top Biosand Filter 
 
Using the bench-top filters constructed at a workshop in our M.Eng lab 1-047 in May 
2002, this study would first develop a breakthrough curve of start-up time and determine 
the effect of pause time on filter performance. Subsequently, this project would 
investigate one of the following topics: 
•  Variability between filters using different source water  (Charles River water vs. other 
surfaces waters) 
•  Variety of sand sources; 
•  Variety of head spaces (2 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm) 
 
2.4 Biosand Filter Performance Testing Protocol and Training Manual  
 
A performance testing protocol is needed for the biosand filters in Lumbini, Nepal. In 
collaboration with Center for Appropriate Water and Sanitation Technology (CAWST), 
this project would also develop a training manual presenting "Best Practices for BioSand 
Filters Use in Nepal." (This project might be linked to other biosand topics listed). 
http://www.cawst.org 
  
2.5 Biosand Filter Testing for Cryptosporidium and/or Giardia 
 
A possible project, under the guidance of Prof. H. Hemond, and in collaboration of 
doctoral student Kristen Jellison,  to investigate cryptosporidium and/or giardia in Nepal.  
Background and Study Objective: Samaritan’s Purse, in conjunction with the Canadian 
International Development Assistance (CIDA) has built and distributed 14,000 biosand 
filters in 24 countries. In 2001, an internal report,  “Biosand Household Water Filter 
Evaluation 2001,” evaluated 100 filters in each of 6 countries (Mozambique, Kenya, 
Cambodia, Vietnam, Honduras, Nicaragua) in 3 regions – Africa, South Asia, Central

America. This  report and others shows consistency in the health benefits reported from 
the filter users, which is not generally reflected in the consistency of the bacterial 
removal data. The reason CAWST hypothesizes that this may be the case is that the 
organisms that are making people sick are primarily the parasites or cysts and not 
bacteria. Yet, the WHO microbial guidelines are defined in terms of indicator bacteria -- 
fecal coliform and E.coli. Researching this contradiction would be at the central goal of 
this study.  
 
 
3. CHLORINATION / SOLAR DISINFECTION 
 
3.1 *** Priority Project***  Chlorine Solution Decay Study 
(Location: Kathmandu) 
Last year M.Eng student, Luca Morganti, in collaboration with colleagues from ENPHO, 
installed and evaluated a SANILEC-6 sodium hypochloride generator (Morganti 2002).  
The new sodium hypochlorite (“Piyush”) product manufactured by ENPHO with this 
generator is decaying at a more rapid rate than the old calcium hypochlorite (“Piyush”) 
product manufactured from imported bleaching powder. We have isolated certain causes 
(e.g. iron spigot, use of municipal piped water supply instead of distilled water) but the 
rate of chlorine decay rate is still unacceptable. Therefore, it is essential that we know 
why this is occurring.  (This study might be combined with another chlorination study, 
such as 3.2) 
 
3.2 *** Priority Project*** Chlorine(Piyush)  Demand Study of Various Source Waters 
(Location: Kathmandu,  one site in the Terai and possibly the Annapurna Circuit) 
Currently, 3 drops of 0.5% chlorine solution per liter of water  is the generalized method 
for chlorination of water recommended by ENPHO for different water sources in Nepal  
The chlorine solution available in Nepal is marketed under the brand name, “Piyush,” and 
may be either the old formulation from bleaching powder or the new formulation of from 
the chlorine generator. In her thesis study, MIT Nepal Water Project team member 
Hannah Sullivan (2002) found that 29% of households in Lumbini maintained proper 
chlorine residual levels between 0.2 mg/l and 1.0 mg/l.  She performed limited chlorine 
dosage testing and found “the low measured chlorine residuals in stored household water 
do not appear to be the result of improper dosage instructions… it may be possible to 
increase the dosage recommendation to 4 drops per liter without exceeding proper free 
chlorine residual levels” (page 80).  Whether the 3 drops per liter dosing regime is 
appropriate for all types of water sources in Nepal is an important question for ENPHO, 
the manufacturer of Piyush and for the MIT Nepal Water Project team.   This research 
project would focus on dosing of Piyush in different water sources including the piped 
water supply in Kathmandu, tube wells, stone spouts, dug wells etc. to determine chlorine 
demand.   If appropriate, a part of this chlorine demand survey could include chlorine 
testing along the Annapurna circuit during the winter (dry) season. This would fill out the 
data set of the chlorine demand survey conducted by Luca Morganti in July 2002 during 
the monsoon season.

3.3 Expansion of SWS Program in Nepal 
(Location: Kathmandu, one or two sites in the Terai, such as Lumbini or Butwal).  
This project would be a collaborative effort with the Center for Disease Control/Safe 
Water System and potentially with PSI, an NGO that is working in several countries to 
socially market the chlorine disinfectant solution.  It could be combined with the Chlorine 
Demand study (2.2 above) and might involve 2 people: 1 M.Eng student, who would 
work with CDC to develop a countrywide program for disseminating the Safe Water 
System program and 1 Sloan School student who would investigate willingness-to-
pay/marketing/promotion of chlorination for widespread adoption. If several students 
were interested in willingness-to-pay, this study could expand to include all the 
household treatment options now available in Nepal. The M.Eng student would prepare 
the country –wide plan and participate in developing a funding proposal for this program.  
 
3.4 UV Disinfection 
 
WaterHealth International has designed and is marketing a community-scale UV 
disinfection unit appropriate for developing countries. However, it is somewhat costly. 
Searching for a  cheaper solutioin, M.Eng. students at the University of California, 
Berkeley have designed a prototype UV tube. This project would investigate these and 
possible other UV drinking water disinfection options. http://www.waterhealth.com 
 
 
 
4. ARSENIC 
 
4.1 *** Priority Project ***  ENPHO Arsenic Removal Filter – Technical Performance 
and Social Acceptability Evaluation  
(Location: Rautahat)  
As a preliminary pilot project, ENPHO and the Nepal Red Cross Society have distributed 
more than 120 household arsenic removal filters in Rautahat district in arsenic affected 
areas. A preliminary study of the performance of these filters has been performed by Jeff 
Hwang (2002).  However, the filter element has been modified since Jeff Hwang’s study, 
and his study occurred in only one site. This new work would evaluate the success of the 
pilot study where the new filter is being deployed in arsenic-affected households. This 
project could involve 1-2 researchers to conduct 1) technical and 2) social evaluation of a 
subset of the ENPHO arsenic removal filters distributed in these arsenic affected areas of 
Rautahat .  
 
4.2 *** Priority Project *** Arsenic-contaminated Sludge  
This project would involve study of the sludge characteristics and disposal issues of 2-3 
promising arsenic remediation technologies already investigated by the MIT Nepal 
Project team to date. It would build on the work of Cambridge University engineering 
graduate,  Reuben Mann (2002), and might involve collaboration with a new student at 
Cambridge University.

4.3 Arsenic Bio-sand Filter  
(Location: Nawalparasi) 
Tommy Ngai, of the 2001-2002 MIT Nepal Water Project team, has come up with  
several innovations to the biosand filter, adapting it to remove arsenic. In April, 2002, he 
was awarded a $10,000 prize by the Lemelson Foundation for this work.  He is currently 
in Nepal until October 15 to test these ideas, and will then return to MIT to assist with the 
2002-2003 M.Eng program. This work requires follow-up in a new M.Eng project --
tracking the pilot study Ngai has established and further development of the technology. 
This project might link up with 4.1 or 4.2. Moreover, it might involve a team of Sloan 
School students who would concurrently be determining the marketing possibilities for 
this technology.  
 
4.4 Arsenic Contamination and Treatment in Salem New Hampshire  
2001-2002 M.Eng Nepal team members found and tested a household in Salem, New 
Hampshire supplied with groundwater from a well contaminated with > 1,000 ug/L 
arsenic. We hypothesize that other households in the same neighborhood, also supplied 
by well water, might also be affected. This project would entail a study comparing 
arsenic contamination and treatment in Salem New Hampshire with arsenic in Nepal. 
This work could be linked with one or several of the other arsenic projects.  
 
4.5 Evaluation of International Development Enterprise’s Shapla Filter 
The Shapla filter is being promoted in Nepal and throughout south Asia by UNICEF and 
International Development Enterprises (IDE), Nepal. IDE performs the marketing 
function for appropriate, low-cost,  rural technologies it believes are solid bets for 
eradication of poverty.  IDE’s most popular product is a foot-operated treadle water pump 
for village tubewells.  These pumps are capable of pumping enough water to irrigate one 
acre of land per day.  So far, more than 40,000 pumps have been sold and installed in 
Nepal and millions throughout the developing world. The Shapla filter is IDE’s best bet 
on a viable, low-cost arsenic remediation filter.   Contact:  Radhe Shyam Bista (Nepal 
Country Director) 
 
 
5. WASTEWATER 
 
5.1 Monitoring of Wetland System (Reed Bed System) at ENPHO 
(Location: Kathmandu) 
ENPHO is pioneering the introduction of wastewater treatment through a reed bed system 
in Nepal.  ENPHO has constructed several such systems in Kathmandu. With the 
increasing demand and curiosity of the people,  ENPHO has built a wastewater treatment 
system on its premises. As this system treats water coming from ENPHO’s daily 
activities which also includes waste water from its Laboratory, it is important to monitor 
the system and to gain information on the capacity of the system while dosing with 
different types of waste water.
