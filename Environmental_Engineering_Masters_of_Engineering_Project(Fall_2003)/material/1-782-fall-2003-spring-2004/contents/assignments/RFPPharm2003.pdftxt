Notice to Prospective Bidders 
 
Recent studies by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) (Kolpin et al., 2002; Barber et al., 
1995) and others (Daughton and Jones-Lepp, 2001; K ümmerer, 2001) have indicated that 
chemicals associated with pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are 
widely present at low concentrations in the surface waters of the United States and 
Europe.  In addition, recent sampling studies by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control 
(CDC) have shown a subset of these and similar chemicals present in source waters 
survive drinking-water treatment processes and remain present in delivered drinking 
water. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the presence and behavior of these 
compounds in drinking water treatment, riverine systems, and ground water. 
 
The anticipated effort will require 800 to 2000 hours of technical effort (2 to 5 MEng 
students), leading to a draft final report on April 19, 2004.  Assuming a one-week review 
by sponsors, a final report is due on Friday, May 7, 2004.  In addition, the successful 
team will be expected to make one or more oral presentations to the client and the public. 
 
To be considered, prospective bidders are asked to forward a letter of intent (LOI) with 
team qualifications to the above address by 5:00 pm, October 2003. The LOI should be 
no longer than 2 pages, exclusive of resumes, and should outline the team ’s preliminary 
plans for the project.  Bidders will be notified by October 10 if they have made the short 
list, and successful bidders will be asked to submit a full technical plus cost proposal by 
December 5, 2003. 
 
Background 
 
An increasing number of published reports are documenting the widespread presence in 
surface water of organic chemicals originating from municipal wastewater.  Chemicals 
commonly found in the surface waters of the U.S. include caffeine, estrogen derivatives, 

1 

antibiotics, antibacterials, fragrances, detergents, and pharmaceuticals.  Environmental 
engineers and scientists are just beginning to evaluate the implications of these findings.  
Although the chemicals are present at low levels, the effects to aquatic organisms of 
constant exposure, long-term exposure, and exposure to a mix of chemicals are unknown.  
Also troubling is the discovery that many of these chemicals are not removed by 
conventional drinking-water treatment and are present in the drinking water supplied to 
some communities. 
 
This study, conducted in cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in 
Atlanta, Georgia, seeks to evaluate the behavior of such chemicals as revealed by an 
extensive data collected by the CDC.  The CDC has collected water samples of source 
water and at several points in a water treatment plant and analyzed those samples for an 
extensive set of organic chemicals.  They have requested additional analysis of these data 
sets from an environmental engineering perspective to understand better the determinants 
of chemical behavior during wastewater treatment.  CDC has also collected an extensive 
set of chemical analyses of private drinking-water wells in the Midwestern United States.  
They have requested additional analysis of this dataset in light of land use and other 
environmental factors using GIS or related analytical tools.  An additional potential 
component of this project is an evaluation of the prevalence and concentration levels of 
these types of organic chemicals in Massachusetts in two river systems of similar size but 
differing character.  The Assabet River, particularly at low flow, is an effluent-dominated 
stream.  At the once-in-ten-years seven-day-average low flow (7Q10), 80 percent of the 
river flow originates from wastewater discharged by four municipal wastewater treatment 
plants along the river.  In contrast, the Ipswich River receives no major municipal 
wastewater discharges and most wastewater is either disposed to ground water via on-site 
septic systems or exported from the basin.  The degree to which organic chemicals in 
wastewaters from on-site systems can migrate via ground water to the river system is 
unknown.  The comparison of the two rivers is expected to shed light on this question. 
 
Proposed Study 
 
The specific topics to be addressed in this study are flexible and should reflect the 
interests and talents of the project team. 
 
One potential component of the study is the analysis of the CDC drinking-water 
treatment data set.  A variety of analytical approaches are viable for this part of the study 
including: 
• 
statistical analysis of the data to identify significant trends and correlations 
between chemical response to water treatment and chemical properties (e.g., by 
principal component analysis) 
•  development of a simulation model of organic chemical fate in one or more 
water-treatment unit processes. 

 
Other analytical techniques are applicable to the CDC ground-water quality data.  
Specifically, land-use and other geographically-based factors are expected to be an 
important determinant of the presence of certain organic chemicals in well water but have 

2 

not yet been analyzed.  GIS data for land use, geology, hydrogeology, soils, and other 
physiographic features are available for at least a subset of the study area.  Analysis of 
relationships between these geographic features and the observed presence and 
concentrations of well-water contaminants is desired, with the goal to determine land-use 
and other factors that indicate a likelihood of ground-water contamination. 
 
Some of the data provided by CDC may be confidential and will require special 
consideration.  These data should not be distributed without written permission by the 
CDC and publication of the data must be cleared by CDC. 
 
The Massachusetts river component of this study requires at least one and preferably two 
participants with a background in chemistry.  The study will entail the analysis of low 
concentrations of organic chemicals in river water samples using novel analytical 
techniques and equipment (liquid chromatography to identify the compounds coupled 
with UV fluorescence and/or mass spectrometry in order to quantify the concentrations —
LC/UV/MS).  Another essential part of the proposed study is field data collection.  The 
team will need to monitor streamflow to identify periods of low flow and then mobilize 
to collect river water-quality samples during low flow.  Proper sample collection 
techniques and sample preservation procedures should be researched prior to the 
sampling program and followed during the program.  The project sponsors also welcome 
proposals for analysis and assessment of the field and laboratory data that result from this 
project.  Possible activities may include: 
• 
statistical analyses of field data and comparison with data from other studies 
including the USGS national reconnaissance (Kolpin et al., 2002); 
•  analysis of field data for selected chemicals to determine fate and transport rate 
constants; and 
•  development of stream water-quality models to predict the fate and transport of 
PPCPs in the Assabet River.   
Information for modeling the Assabet River is available in a prior M.Eng. project report 
(Savineau et al., 1999).
