Consider  the  following  economy.  There  is  continuum  of  workers  with  mass 
1,  each  endowed  with  L  units  of  labor,  and  a  continuum  of  goods  of  mass  N . 
They  have  the  same  utility  given  by �  N  1 − e−bci 
U  = 
b
0 
where N  is the number of goods, which is endogenous.  Each diﬀerentiated good 
is  produced  by  a  monopoly.  There  is  a  ﬁxed  overhead  cost  equal  to  ¯ l  units  of 
labor.  There  is  no  variable  cost  (an  arbitary  large  quantity  of  the  good  can  be 
produced:  these  goods  are  like  software, music,  etc). 
1.  Show  that  if  the  price  of  good  i  is  pi ,  then  the  demand  for  good  i  by  a 
consumer  with  income  R  is 

di,

c¯ = 

where

ci  = ¯c − 
ln pi ,
R +  1  � N  pi  ln pidi
b

b  0

2.  Show  that  each  ﬁrm will  charge  a price  pi  = p = e c−1 , where  ¯
c  is deﬁned 
b¯
as  above  and  common  to  all  workers. 
N  is  endogenously  determined  by  the  free  entry  condition.  We  normalize 
the  common  price  level  to  p = 1. 
3.  Compute  the  wage  level  w  (as  deﬁned  by  the  wage  of  1  unit  of  labor,  so 
that  a  worker’s  income  is  wL).  How  does  it  depend  on  the  overhead  labor  cost 
¯ l?  Explain  why. 
4.  Compute  the  utility  of  a  worker.  How  is  it  aﬀected  by  total  productivity 
(as measured  by  L)  and  overhead  costs? 
We  now  modify  the  model  and  assume  that  each  worker  is  also  endowed 
with  q  units  of  managerial  quality.  A  ﬁrm  employing  a  manager  of  quality  q 
has  a  total  overhead  cost  now  equal  to  ¯ l/q  (instead  of  just  ¯ l).  q  is  uniformly 
q−qmin
distributed  in  the  population  over  [qmin , qmax ],  i.e.  with  c.d.f.  F (q) =  qmax −qmin 
and  density  f (q) =  F � (q)  = 
.  Each  worker  has  to  work  either  as 
1
qmax −qmin 
a  worker  or  a  manager,  and  can’t  do  both.  There  is  free  entry  of  ﬁrms  which 
compete to hire managers.  Let ω(q) be the wage paid to a manager with quality 
q  in  equilibrium. 
5.  Show  that  (with  the  same  price  normalization  as  before),  one must  have 
ω(q) = 1/b − wl/q

6.  Show  that  all  workers  with  managerial  quality  q  >  q∗  become  managers 
in  equilibrium,  where 
f (q)dq 
q 
q∗ 
7.  Show  that  this  condition  deﬁnes  a  unique  q∗  such  that  both  q∗  and  ¯ l/q∗ 
go  up  when  ¯ l  rises. 
8.  Show  that  the  equilibrium  wage  is 

LF (q∗ ) = 

w = 

1 
b(L + l/q∗ ) 
¯ 
9.  How  does  an  increase  in  overhead  costs  ¯ l  aﬀect 
(i)  The  absolute  income  level  for  production  workers  wL? 
(ii)  Their  utility 
(iii)  The  number  of  managers? 
(iii)  Inequality  (as  measured  by  income  ratios)  between  production  workers 
and  low-quality managers? 
(iv)  Inequality  between  production  workers  and  high-quality managers? 
(v)  Inequality  between  two  managers  who  remain  in  that  activity  after  the 
increase  in  ¯ l 

10.  Same  questions  for  a  change  in  productivity  L.
