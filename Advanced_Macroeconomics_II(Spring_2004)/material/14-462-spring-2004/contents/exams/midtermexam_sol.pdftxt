1.  The  ﬁrst  order  condition  for  consumption  is 
e−bci  = µpi 

and  solving  for  consumption  yields

ci  = 

[log(pi ) + log(µ)] .

Substituting  into  the  budget  constraint  yields

The  ﬁrst  order  condition  is

and  so  the  ﬁrm  will  charge  pi  = eb¯ 1−c

b 

. 

3.  Using  the  normalization,  proﬁts  are  given  by  ¯c,  and  due  to  free  entry  proﬁts  must 
¯
go  to  workers.  A  ﬁrm  employs  l  units  of  labor,  so  w  =
 ¯c 
¯l .
 The  price  normalization

also  implies  ¯c =

From  labor market  clearing N

and  falls  with

proﬁts  have  to  be  distributed  among more  workers.

6.  The  left  hand  side  is  the  supply  of  workers,  the  right  hand  side  is  the  demand  for 
� qmax  f (q) dq

workers.  Again  only  the  ratio  λ =  L  matters,  and  diﬀerentiating  this  yields

Using  the  equation  implicitly  deﬁning  q ∗  one  can  also  write 
∂ q ∗  λ
F (q ∗ ) 
f (q ∗ ) [q ∗  + λ] 
∂λ  q ∗ 
Substituting  the  assumed  distribution  function  and  density  yields 
q ∗  − qmin 
∂ q ∗  λ
∂λ  q ∗ 
q∗  + λ

which  insures  that  l  is  increasing  in  l. 
q∗ 
7.  The  manager  with  ability  q∗  must  be  indiﬀerent  between  managing  and  working,  so 
we must  have 

wL = 

− w

1 
b 

¯
l 
q ∗ 

and  so 

We  can  write 

w =

wL =

b 
1 +  λ 
q∗ 

8.  The  absolute  wage  level  clearly  falls.	 The  number  of  ﬁrms  and  thus  the  number  of 
managers  is N  = 1 − F (q ∗ )  and  falls.  If  income  is  R,  then  utility  is 
1 − e−b 
R 
N 
U (R, N ) = N 
b 
We  already  know  that  the  income  of  a  worker  wL  falls,  which  reduces  utility.  We 
�
� 
also know  that N  falls.  It  remains  to  show  that  the  fall  in N  also  reduces utility.  We 
have 
R 
b 
N

where 

g(x) = 1 − e−x  − xe−x . 
We  have  g(0) = 0  and  g � (x) = 1 + xe−x ,  so  utility  is  increasing  in N . 
We  have

so  inequality  between  workers  and  low-quality managers  falls.  Now

∂ q ∗  λ

so  inequality  between  production  workers  and  high-quality  managers  increases  (al­
though  qmax  may  not  be  high  enough  to  have  an  increase  in  inequality).
