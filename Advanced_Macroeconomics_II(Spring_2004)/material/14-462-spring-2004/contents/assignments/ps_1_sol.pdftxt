The  case  α  =  β  is  not  interesting,  so  assume  β  >  α.  Let  r  and  w  be  the  (shadow) 
prices  of  capital  and  labor.  The  cost  functions  corresponding  to  the  two  technologies  are

and

β−α .  If  labor  is  relatively  cheap,  it  is  cheaper 
ω  <  ¯

to  use  the  labor  intensive  technology.  The  capital-labor  ratios  used  as  a  function  of  the 
relative  price  of  labor  are  given  by  κ1 (ω) =  1−α ω  and  κ2 (ω) =  β  ω ,  respectively.  We 
α
1−β 
have  k1  =  κ1 ( ¯
ω)  and  k2  =  κ2 ( ¯
ω).  These  are  the  capital-labor  ratios  employed  if  both 
technologies  are  used. 
Now  there  are  three  regions  for  the  capital-labor  ratio.  If  k  ∈  [0, k1 ),  then  κ−1 (k) ≤  ¯ω

and  it  is  an  equilibrium  if  only  technology  one  is  used:  if  technology  one  operates  with 
capital-labor  ratio  k ,  this  induces  a  relative  price  of  labor  given  which  it  is  cheaper  to  use 
technology  one.  Clearly  it  is  not  an  equilibrium  for  both  technologies  to  be  used  since  the 
capital-labor  ratios  k1  and  k2  are  too  large  to  be  consistent  with  an  aggregate  ratio  of  k . 
Similarly,  if  k  ∈  [k2 , +∞),  then  κ−1 (k)  ≥  ω  and  the  only  equilibrium  is  that  only 
¯
2 
technology  two  is  used. 
Finally,  if  k  ∈  (k1 , k2 ),  then  both  technologies  must  be  used  in  equilibrium.  If  only 
technology  one  is  used,  then  κ−1 (k)  >  ¯ω  and  technology  two  is  cheaper,  a  contradiction. 
1 
If  only  technology  two  is  used,  then  κ−1 (k) <  ¯ω  and  technology  one  is  cheaper.  There  is  a 
2 
unique equilibrium in which both technologies are used:  the two equations k1L1 +k2L2  = kL 
and  L1  + L2  = L  have  a  unique  solution  and  this  solution  has  k1 , L1 , k2 , L2  > 0. 
We  have  determined  the  allocation  of  capital  and  labor  for  all  three  regions,  which  in 
turn  pins  down marginal  products  and  factor  prices.
