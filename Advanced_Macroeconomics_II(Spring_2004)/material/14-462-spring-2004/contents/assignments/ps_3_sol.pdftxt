1.  The  diﬀerential  equation  in  the  case  of  one  good  is  Q˙
1  = Φ1 (Q1 )  where 
Φ1 (Q1 ) = δ1  [1 − F (a0  + A(Q1 )) − Q1 ] .

Here  we  are  given  a  speciﬁc  distribution:

F (x) = min  max

and  so  the  condition  for  the  steady  state  is

a0  + A(Q1 ) − ( ¯
y − σ) 
Q1  = 1 − min  max 
, 0 , 1
2σ 
If  a0  + A(1)  < y¯ − σ ,  then  Q1  =  1  is  a  steady  state:  if  cumulative  output  is  equal 
to  one,  then  productivity  is  suﬃciently  high  such  that  everybody  can  aﬀord  to  buy 
the  good.  This  steady  state  is  also  stable:  for  Q1  slightly  below  1,  we  have  Q˙
1  >  0. 
If  a0  + A(0)  > y¯ − σ ,  then  Q1  =  0  is  a  steady  state:  with  no  cumulative  output, 
productivity  is  so  low  that  nobody  can  aﬀord  to  buy  the  good.  If  a0  + A(Q1 )  ∈
[y¯ − σ, y¯ + σ ],  then Q1  is  a  steady  state  if

2.  We  already  discussed  stability  for  the  corner-solutions,  so  let’s  focus  on  the  stability 
of  possible  steady  states  with  a0  + A(Q1 )  ∈  [ ¯y − σ, y¯ + σ ].  Stability  requires  that 
a  small  increase  in  Q1  makes  Φ(Q1 )  negative  and  that  a  small  decrease  makes  it 
positive.  This  leads  to  the  condition: 
A� (Q1 ) > −2σ. 
It  is  clear  that  the  condition  A� (Q1 )  <  0  is  a  typo,  both  in  terms  of  the  sign  of 
the  inequality  and  the  right  hand  side.  The  destabilizing  force  is  that  an  increase 
in  cumulative  output  increases  productivity  which  increases  demand  which  in  turn 
increases  cumulative  output.  For  a  steady  state  to  be  stable,  this  force  cannot  be  to 
strong.  This  force  is weaker  if A� (Q1 )  is not too negative, because then an  increase  in 
cumulative  output  does  not  reduce  productivity  that much.  The  force  is  also weaker 
if σ  is large, because then a given reduction in productivity does not increase demand 
very much.

3.  From  now  on  let’s  focus  on  the  interesting  case  in which  a0  + A(Q1 ) ∈ ( ¯y − σ, y¯ + σ) 
and  in  which  the  stability  condition  is  satisﬁed.  Implicit  diﬀerentiation  yields

Making food more diﬃcult to produce reduces steady state cumulative output of good 
one.

2σ + A (Q1 )

Thus  an  increase  in  inequality  will  increase  steady  state  cumulative  output  if  y  < 
¯
a0  + A(Q1 ),  that  is  if  the  average  agent  cannot  aﬀord  the  industrial  good.  In  this 
case only the upper tail can aﬀord the  industrial good, and  increasing  inequality puts 
more  mass  into  the  upper  tail.  If  instead  y  >  a0  + A(Q1 ),  then  only  the  lower  tail 
¯
cannot aﬀord  the  industrial good.  Now  increasing  inequality  increases  the number  of 
people  unable  to  aﬀord  the  industrial  good  by  putting more mass  in  the  lower  tail. 

5.  I  guess  here	 one  may  want  to  distinguish  between  cumulative  output  and  output 
(in  steady  state  they  are  the  same,  but  they  can  be  diﬀerent  during  the  transition), 
and  the  path  of  output  is  perhaps more  interesting.  Suppose  we  are  in  the  situation 
where  an  increase  in  inequality  increases  the  steady  state  level  of  cumulative  output. 
Of  course  cumulative  output  cannot  jump  and  will  converge  gradually  to  the  new 
steady  state.  However,  output will  jump up  immediately as more people  can buy  the 
industrial  good,  and  it  continues  to  increase  during  the  transition  as  the  production 
of  the  industrial  good  becomes  cheaper  as  time  passes.

6.  The  analogous  steady  state  condition  for  the  second  industrial  good  is 
a0  + A1 (Q1 ) + A2 (Q2 ) − y¯

and  implicit  diﬀerentiation  yields

If  ¯y  ≤  a0  + A1 (Q1 ),  then  inequality  clearly  increases  output  of  the  second  industrial 
good.  Holding  Q1  constant  the  same  logic  as  in  the  previous  part  applies,  and  the 

a0 +A1 (Q1 )−y¯

increase  in Q1  goes  in the same direction (the  logic  is the same as that of a  fall  in a0 ). 
If  y¯ ≥  a0  + A1 (Q1 ) + A(Q2 ),  inequality  clearly  reduces  output,  as  now  both  eﬀects 
are  reversed.  But  the  eﬀect  is  ambiguous  for  intermediate  values  of  y¯.  The  direct 
eﬀect of  the  increase  in  inequality  is positive, but  the  fall  in Q1  works  in  the opposite 
direction.  It  could  happen  that  Q2  increases  while  Q1  falls.  So  it  need  not  be  the 
case  that  all  industrial  goods move  in  the  same  direction.
