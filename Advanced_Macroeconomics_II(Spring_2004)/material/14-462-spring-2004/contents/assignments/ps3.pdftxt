Problem  set  3 

We take the Matsuyama model and want to compute the eﬀect of  inequality. 
We  assume  labor  endowment  y  is  distributed  uniformly  over  [y¯ −  σ, y¯ +  σ ]. 
Unit  labor  requirement  in  the  food  sector  is  a0 .  Unit  labor  requirement  in  the 
industrial  sector  (good  1)  is A(Q1 ), A�  < 0, where Q1  is  total  output  of  good  1. 

1.  Show  that  the  equilibrium  steady  state  level  of  Q1  must  satisfy 
a0  − y¯ + A(Q1 ) 
Q1  = 1/2 − 
. 
2σ
2.  Show  that  an  equilibrium  is  stable  if  and  only  if  A� (Q1 ) < 0  locally. 
3.  What  is  the  eﬀect  of  a0  and  ¯y  on  Q1 ?  Explain. 
4.  Show  that  an  increase  in  income  dispersion  σ  may  increase  or  reduce 
output depending on whether  or not  the  average agent  can aﬀord  the  industrial 
good. 
5.  What  is  the  typical  path  followed  by  output  as  σ  increases? 
6.  Assume  now  that  there  is  a  second  industrial  good,  good  2,  with  the 
same  hierarchical  preferences  as  in  the  Matsuyama  paper.  How  is  its  output 
determined  in  steady  state?  How  does  inequality  aﬀect  it?  Does  inequality 
always  aﬀect  the  output  of  each  industrial  good  in  the  same  way?
