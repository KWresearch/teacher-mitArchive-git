1.  First  let’s  ignore  that  some  goods  are  non-traded. 	 The  ﬁrst  order  condition  of  the 
consumer  problem  is 
α −1

where  λ  is  the  multiplier  on  the  budget  constraint.  Solving  for  ck  and  substituting 
into  the  budget  constraint  to  solve  for  λ,  we  get  the  demand  functions

4.  There  is  symmetry  among  exporting  ﬁrms  in	 country  i.  Thus  diﬀerent  types  of 
managerial  quality  used  in  equilibrium must  give  rise  to  the  same  proﬁts.  The  same 
is  true  for  non-exporting  ﬁrms. 
5.  Suppose  to  the contrary  that a manager with q �  > q is hired by a non-exporting ﬁrm. 
Then  we  get 

πP i (q � ) − ωi (q � ) ≥ πP i (q) − ωi (q) 
πN i (q) − ωi (q) ≥ πN i (q � ) − ωi (q � ) 

The ﬁrst inequality states that non-exporting ﬁrms do at least as well with a manager 
of  ability  q �  as  with  a  manager  of  ability  q .  The  second  inequality  states  that  the 
reverse  is  true  for  exporting  ﬁrms.  Combining  these  inequalities  yields 
πP i (q � ) − πP i (q) ≥ πN i (q � ) − πN i (q). 

This  is  a  contradiction:  since  exporting  ﬁrms  have  a  larger  market,  an  increase  in 
managerial ability is associated with a larger increase in proﬁts than for non-exporting 
ﬁrms. 
6.  Each  exporting  ﬁrm  needs  a manager,  so  the  upper  critical  value  qN i  satisﬁes  Li (1 −
� 
�
F (qN i )) = Ni ,  which  implies 
qN i  = F −1  1 − 
Ni 
Li 
Each non-exporting ﬁrm also needs a manager,  so the  lower critical value qP i  satisﬁes 
�
� 
Li (1 − F (qP i )) = Ni  + Pi .  Thus 
Ni  + Pi 
qP i  = F −1  1 − 
Li

To  see  how  this  result  is  obtained,  consider  the  ﬁrst  term  of  ¯p 1−σ , which  corresponds 
1 
to  the  P1  non-exporting  ﬁrms  in  country  1.  All  managers  in  the  range  [qP 1 , qN 1 ] 
�1−σ 
�
will  be  assigned  to  this  ﬁrms,  and  since  ﬁrms  are  identical  it  does  not  matter  which 
manager  is  assigned  to which ﬁrm,  so we  can  think  of  assigning  them  randomly.  The

Of  course  by  construction 
,  so  the  term  reduces  to  the  one  in  the 
qP 1 
formula  above.  Another  way  of  deriving  this  term  is  to  think  of  managers  not  as 
� 
�
assigned  randomly  but  instead  in  ascending  order  as  a  function  of  the  index  of  the 
good.  Then  the  quality  of  the manger  assigned  to  good  k  in  country  1  is  given  by

7.  It  does  not  really  matter  how  the  schedule  looks  to  the  left  of	 qP i ,  as  long  at  it  is 
below  wi .  Part  4  pins  down  the  shape  on  the  intervals  [qP i , qN i ]  and  [qN i , q¯i ].  We 
only  need  to  determine what  happens  at  the  critical  values.  Clearly  it must  be  equal 
to  wi  at  qP i .  If  it  is  below  wi  the  agent  would  rather  be  a  worker,  if  it  is  above 
wi ,  then  ﬁrms  in  the  non-exporting  sector  would  rather  hire  a  manager  with  ability 
slightly  less  that  qP i .  The  schedule  must  also  be  continuous  at  qN i .  If  it  jumps  up,

exporting  ﬁrms  would  rather  hire  a  manager  with  ability  slightly  less  than  qN i .  If

it  jumps  down,  non-exporting  ﬁrms  would  rather  hire  a manager  with  ability  slighty

above  qN i .  Continuity  in  combination  with  the  result  from  part  4.  implies  the  wage

Thus  σ > 2  implies  that  the  return  to  managerial  quality  is  increasing  as  one  moves

up  the  quality  ladder,  with  an  upward  jump  at  qN i .

10.  As N1 + P1  remains unchanged,  there  is no change  in  ¯qP 1 .  Thus the only eﬀect comes

through a decrease  in  qN 1 .  As  the highest wage depends negatively on  qN 1 ,  this  leads

to  an  increase  in  inequality.  What  happens  is  that  the  returns  to managerial  quality

increase  over  the  range  [qN1 , qN1 +dN1 ]. 


11.  You  could  go  through  a  nightmare  of  algebra  if  you  wanted  to.
