There  are  two  countries,  denoted  by  i  = 1, 2.  Each  country  produces  a 
mass  (continuum)  of  traded  goods  Ni  and  of  non-traded  goods  Pi .  Each  good 
is  produced  by  an  individual  monopolist.  There  is  no  overlap  between  the 
goods  produced  by  one  country  and  those  produced  by  the  other  country.  All

consumers  have  a  utility  given  by

where  α ∈  (0, 1),  and  N  = N1  + P1  + N2  + P2  is  the  total  (maximum)  number 
of  goods.  The  goods  are  ordered  as  follows: 
•
⇒ 
k ∈ [0, P1 ] =  Non  traded  good  produced  by  country  1 
•  k ∈

[P1 , N1  + P1 ] =  Traded  good  produced  by  country  1 
•  k ∈
⇒ 
[N1  + P1 , N1  + P1  + N2 ] =  Traded  good  produced  by  country  2 
⇒ 
•  k ∈
[N1  + P1  + N2 , N ] =  Traded  good  produced  by  country  2

The  price  charged  by  producer  of  good  k  is  denoted  by  pk .  One  will  denote 
σ = 1/(1 − α)  and  µ = σ/(σ − 1). 
1.  Compute  the  demand  function  for  each  of  the  four  types  of  goods,  as 
a  function  of  its  price,  the  aggregate  nominal  national  income  of  each  country 
Yi ,  and  other  producers’  prices.  Show  that  the  contribution  of  other  producers’

The  production  function  for  any  good  k  is  given  by 

yk  = qk lk , 

where  qk  is  the  quality  of  the manager hired by  the ﬁrm  (each ﬁrm uses  exactly 
1 manager),  and  lk  is  its  labor  input.  wi  is  the  wage  of  raw  labor  in  country  i. 

2.  Show  that  the  price  charged  by  a  ﬁrm  with  managerial  quality  qk  in 
country  i  is

Compute the output and employment of a ﬁrm as a function of its managerial 
quality,  wages,  aggregate  income  and  price  indices,  in  the  four  cases.

3.  Compute  the  proﬁt  of  a  ﬁrm  in  the  four  cases,  denoted  as  functions 
πP 1 (q), πN 1 (q), πN 2 (q), πP 2 (q). 

We now try to characterize the wage schedule ωi (q), which tells us how much 
a manager  of  quality  q  earns  in  country  i.  Firms  chose  their managerial  quality 
by  maximizing  π(q) − ω(q),  where  π(.)  is  the  relevant  proﬁt  function  for  the 
type  of  ﬁrm  being  considered. 
4.  Show  that  if  two  types  q , q �  are  both  employed  by  exporting  ﬁrms  in 
country  i,  then  it  must  be  that 
ωi (q) − ωi (q � ) = πN i (q) − πN i (q � ), 
and  that  a  similar  equality  holds  if  they  are  both  employed  by  non-exporting 
ﬁrms. 

We  assume  each  individual  is  endowed  with  one  unit  of  labor  exactly,  and 
q  units  of  managerial  quality.  In  country  i,  managerial  quality  is  distributed 
� (q) = fi (q). Furthermore,  total  labor 
over  [0, q¯i ], with  c.d.f Fi (q),  and density Fi
force  in  country  i  Li  is  such  that  Li  > Ni  + Pi .  People  have  to  fully  specialize 
between  being  a  manager  or  a  worker. 

5.  Show  that  in equilibrium  if a manager  type  q  is employed  in an exporting 
ﬁrm  then  any manager  with  q �  > q  is  also  hired  by  an  exporting  ﬁrm. 

We  thus  look  for  an  equilibrium  such  that  in  country  i,  there  exists  two 
critical  values  qP i , qN i  such  that  qP i  < qN i  and 
-if  q ∈  [0, qP i ] ,  the  worker  supplies  labor 
-if  q ∈  [qP i , qN i ] ,  the  worker  becomes  a  manager  in  the  non-traded  sector 
-if  q ∈  [qN i , q¯i ],  the  worker  becomes  a manager  in  the  traded  sector 

6.  What  are  the  values  of  qP i  and  qN i ?  What  are  the  values  of  the  price 
indices  ¯pi  as  a  function  of  the  wages wi ,  the  critical  levels  qP i  and  qN i ,  and  the 
distributions  of  managerial  quality? 

7.  So  that  the  wage  schedule  for managers  is  given  by 
ω(qP i ) =	 wi  + πP 1 (q) − πP 1 (qP i ),  q ∈  [qP i , qN i ] 
wi  + πP 1 (qN i ) − πP 1 (qP i ) + πN 1 (q) − πN 1 (qN i ) 

How  does  the  return  to  managerial  quality  evolve  when  one  moves  up  the 
quality  ladder,  if  σ > 2? 

8.  Show  that  Yi  = µwiLiF (qP i )  and  that  the model  can  be  closed  either  by 
–Writing  one  of  two  (redundant)  labor market  clearing  conditions  and  pick­
ing  a  price  normalization

10.  We  now  look  at  the  eﬀect  of  increases  in  international  trade  in  country 
one,  by  assuming  a  marginal  increase  in  N1 ,  dN1  >  0,  compensated  by  a  fall 
in  P1 ,  dP1  =  −dN1 ,  so  that  the  total  number  of  goods  in  country  1  remains 
constant.  We  measure  inequality  by  the  ration  between  the  highest  and  the 
lowest  wage. 
Show  that,  holding  Yi  and  p¯i  constant,  this  shift  increases  inequality.  Why? 

11.  How  would  you  go  about  evaluating  the  indirect  contribution  of  the 
induced  changes  in  Yi  and  ¯pi  in  country  1?
