Problem  1 

1.  The  guess


Problem  Set  6  Solution 

ki  = βxi  + (1 − β )y .


implies


K  = β θ + (1 − β )y .

Combining  this  with  the  relationship  y = K + σy u  yields

y = θ +  σuu 
β


Thus  as  a  signal  of  θ  the  precision  is  β 2πy .  Deﬁne


Then  we  have 

φ =

πx  + β 2πy 

E[θ xi , y ] = φxi  + (1 − φ)y .

Optimal  investment  is  given  by

|
|
=  [(1 − α) + αβ ]E[θ xi , y ] + α(1 − β )y

Substituting  for  E[θ xi , z , y ]  we  have 
ki  =  [(1 − α) + αβ ]φxi  + [[(1 − α) + αβ ](1 − φ) + α(1 − β − γ )] y 

Matching  coeﬃcients  we  get 

or  equivalently

in  πx  and  decreasing  in  πy .  It  follows  that  β  is  increasing  in  πx  and  decreasing  in  πy ,

with  Bα  <  0,  Bπx  >  0  and  Bπy  <  0.  For  future  purposes  it  is  useful  to  compute  the

What  is  the  intuition  for  these  results.  If  α  increases,  then  complementarities  are 
stronger,  and  agents put more weight on  the public  signal  since  it helps predict what 
others will do.  Higher precision of the private signal induces agents to put more weight 
on  the  private  signal  and  higher  precision  of  the  signal  about  K  induces  agents  to 
put  more  weight  on  this  public  signal.  However,  notice  one  diﬀerence  to  the  paper 
by  Angeletos  and  Pavan.  If  you  increases  α,  this  makes  it  more  attractive  to  put 
more weight on  the public  signal.  But  if agents put more weight on  the public  signal, 
this  makes  the  public  signal  less  informative  about  θ ,  which  makes  it  less  attractive 
to  put  weight  on  the  public  signal,  partially  oﬀsetting  the  initial  eﬀect.  Thus  all  the 
eﬀects  on  β  are  muted  in  comparison  to  Angeletos  and  Pavan.  Why  is  the  elasticity 
with  respect  to  πx  and  πy  less  than  1  in  absolute  value.  Suppose  we  increase  πx  by 
2 
one  percent  and  β  increases  by more  that  0.5  percent.  Then  relative  precision  of  the 
public  signal y  actually  increases,  in which case agents would not have wanted  to put 
more weight on  the private  signal  in  the ﬁrst place.  Similarly,  suppose we  increase πy 
by  one  percent.  If  β  decreases  by  more  than  0.5  percent,  than  relative  precision  of 
the  public  signal  actually  decreases,  but  in  this  case  agents  would  not  have  wanted 
to  put more  weight  on  the  public  signal  in  the  ﬁrst  place. 
It  is  also  instructive  to  consider  how  φ  depends  on  the  parameters.  We  have

Again  there  is  a  unique  solution 

φ = Φ(α, πx , πy ) 

with  Φα  > 0,  Φπx  > 0  and  Φπy  < 0.  Equation  (1)  implies 
B (α, πx , πy ) ≤ Φ(α, πx , πy ) 

with  strict  inequality  if  α > 0  and  clearly  the  wedge  is  increasing  in  α. 

2.  We  have 

Var(ki θ, y) = Var(βxi  + (1 − β )y θ, y) =

β 2 
πx 

so  heterogeneity  as  a  function  of  parameters  is  given  by 

H (α, πx , πy ) = 

B (α, πx , πy )2 
πx 

It  is  decreasing  in  α  and  πy .  Both  higher  α  and  higher  πy  induce  agents  to  put  less 
weight  on  the  private  signal,  and  less weight  on  the  private  signal  translates  into  less 
heterogeneity.  If  πx  increases,  this  directly  reduces  heterogeneity.  But  agents  also 
become more  responsive  to  the  private  signal,  which  tends  to  increase  heterogeneity. 
But  since  the  elasticity  is  less  than  1 
2 , we know  that  this does not  overturn  the direct 
eﬀect,  and  so  heterogeneity  falls.  This  diﬀers  from  Angeletos  and  Pavan,  where  the

Thus  volatility  as  a  function  of  the  parameters  is  given  by 
1 − B (α, πx , πy ) 
B (α, πx , πy ) 
πy 
Clearly  volatility  is  increasing  in  α  and  decreasing  in  πx .  Higher  α  induces  agents 
to  put  more  weight  on  the  public  signal,  increasing  volatility.  Higher  precision  of 
the  private  signal  does  the  opposite.  The  eﬀect  of  an  increase  in  the  precision  πy  is 
more  complicated.  The  direct  eﬀect  is  to  reduce  volatility.  There  are  two  indirect 
eﬀects, both related to the fact that agents become more responsive to the public and 
thus  less  responsive  to  the  private  signal.  Higher  responsiveness  to  the  public  signal 
increases  volatility.  This  eﬀect  is  also  present  in  Angeletos  and  Pavan.  In  addition, 
less  responsiveness  to  the  private  signal  reduces  the  precision  of  y  as  a  signal  about 
θ ,  partially  oﬀsetting  the  increase  in  πy  and  thus  increasing  in  volatility.  Volatility

as  a  function  of  πy  is  analyzed  in  ﬁgure  1.  Only  the  ratio  of  πx  and  πy  matters  for 
the  shape,  so  I  restrict  attention  to  the  case  πx  = 1.  Thus  the  ﬁgure  shows  volatility 
as  function  of  πy  given  πx  =  1,  and  the  graph  is  plotted  for  diﬀerent  values  of  α. 
Of  course  one  ﬁnds  that  higher  α  is  associated  with  higher  volatility.  Volatility  is

So  we  can  analyze  welfare  by  looking  at 
Ω(α, πx , πy ) = (1 − 2α)V (α, πx , πy ) + H (α, πx , πy ). 

Since  both  volatility  and  heterogeneity  are  decreasing  in  πx ,  we  immediately  get 
that  Ω(α, πx , πy )  is  decreasing  in  πx .  Thus  making  private  information  more  precise 
is  unambiguously  good  for  welfare.  This  is  diﬀerent  from  Angeletos  and  Pavan. 
There more precise private information meant less uncertainty at the expense of lower 
coordination,  with  ambiguous  overall  eﬀects  on  welfare.  But  here  precise  private

⇐⇒ 

information  is  also  vital  for  the  informativeness  of  the  public  signal  and  thus  for 
coordination.  So  it makes  sense  that  here  the  eﬀect  is  unambiguous.

The  condition  α  <  1  is  suﬃcient  for  Ω(α, πx , πy )  to  be  positive.  Thus  the  last  rela­
2 
tionship implies that Ω(α, πx , πy ) is increasing in β  for given πx .  Since β  is decreasing 
in  πy ,  it  follows  that  making  public  information  more  precise  also  increases  welfare. 
Also  notice  that  the  right  hand  side  is  decreasing  in  α  for  given  β  and  πx .  Since 
β  is  decreasing  in  α,  it  follows  that  Ω(α, πx , πy )  is  also  decreasing  in  α.  Making 
complementarities  stronger  improves  welfare. 

4.  For this part I will not try to sign derivatives analytically. 	 Instead I derive the relevant 
formulas  and  perform  a  limited  numerical  evaluation. 
Now  start  with  the  guess 

This  implies


ki  = βxi  + γ z + (1 − β − γ )y . 

K  = β θ + γ z + (1 − β − γ )y .

Eliminating  φ,  we  now  get  the  following  equation  for  β

Again  there  is  a  unique  solution 

= 

πx 
πx  + πz  + β 2πy 

with  Bα  < 0,  Bπx  > 0,  Bπz  < 0,  Bπy  < 0. 
From  the  condition  deﬁning  γ  we  get 

β  = B (α, πx , πz , πy )

I will not try to sign the derivatives but instead do some limited numerical evaluation. 
This  is  done  in  Figure  2,  and  the  results  contain  nothing  unexpected.  An  increase 
in  the  degree  of  complementarity  leads  to  an  increase  in  the  weight  on  z ,  as  does  an 
increase  in  its  own  precision,  while  higher  precision  of  the  other  signals  reduces  the 
weight  on  z .  Finally  the  coeﬃcient  on  y  is  given  by 
1 − β − γ  = D(α, πx , πy , πz ) ≡= 1 − B (α, πx , πy , πz ) − C (α, πx , πy , πz ) 

Figure  3  provides  a  limited  numerical  evaluation  of  the  properties  of  D.  Notice  that 
more  complementarity  does  not  necessarily  lead  to  an  increase  in  the  weight  on  y . 
This  makes  sense,  since  now  there  is  an  alternative  public  signal  available.  As  α 
increases,  more  weight  is  put  on  public  information,  but  as  the  weight  on  private 
information  shrinks,  y  becomes  less  and  less  precise  as  a  signal  about  θ,  and  thus  at 
high  levels  of  α  the  signal  z  is  the more  attractive  public  signal. 
Heterogeneity  is  once  again

Again  we  can  analyze  welfare  by  looking  at

Ω(α, πx , πy , πz ) = (1 − 2α)V (α, πx , πy , πz ) + H (α, πx , πy , πz ). 
Figure  5  provides  a  limited  numerical  evaluation.  Notice  that  an  increase  in  πz  can 
reduce  welfare.

4.  With  Rβ  = 1  the  Euler  equation  becomes

and  as marginal  utility  is  strictly  convex  and  endowment  shocks  are  nondegenerate 
Et [ct+1 ] > ct . 
Thus  Rβ  < 1  is  needed  to  obtain  zero  expected  consumption  growth. 

5.  The  way  the  budget  constraints  are  written  the  price  of  the  asset  is  normalized  to 
one.  Then  it  is  more  convenient  to  write  wt  =  ct  + pt bt+1  and  wt  =  et  + dt bt  where 
now  dt  ≥  0  is  a  given  i.i.d.  dividend  and  the  price  pt  has  to  adjust  in  equilbrium. 
The  Euler  equation  is  then 

e−γ p = βE[d� (e� )−γ ]

and  so  the  price  is  a  function  of  the  current  endowment:

p(e) = e γ βE[d� (e� )−γ ] 
A  high  endowment  today  implies  low  expected  consumption  growth,  which  makes 
transferring  resources  into  the  future  attractive,  so  the  price  of  the  asset  has  to  be 
high  for  no  trade  to  be  an  equilibrium. 
If  there  is  only  idiosyncratic  risk,  then  we  have  an  endowment  economy  version  of 
Aiyagari.  No  trade  is  then  of  course  not  an  equilibrium  and  the  interest  rate  will 
depend  on  the  wealth  distribution.  In  steady  state  we  of  course must  have  Rβ  < 1. 
6.  Here  we  have  a  special  case  of  part  3.  If  βR1−γ  < 1,  then
