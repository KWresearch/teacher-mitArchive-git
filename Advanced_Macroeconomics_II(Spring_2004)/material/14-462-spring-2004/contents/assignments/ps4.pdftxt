Problem  set  4


Consider  the  following model 

pt  = αp e  + εt
t+1 
Where pt  is the endogenous variable (say an asset price), pt+1  its expected value, 
e
and εt  an iid shock with zero mean and variance σ2 , which is not known a period 
ahead. 
1.  What  is  the  rational  expectations  equilibrium  (REE)? 
Assume  that  instead  of  rational  expectations,  we  have  a  learning  process 
deﬁned  by 

1
p  = p e  + (pt− 1  − pt ),
e 
e
t+1 
t 
gt 
where  gt  is  a  deterministic  sequence  of  strictly  positive  numbers/ 
We  will  say  that  the  learning  process  converges  to  the  REE  if 
lim  E (pt+1  − Et,REE pt+1 )2  = 0, 
e
t→ +∞ 

where E  is the unconditional expectations operator, and Et,REE pt+1  is the value 
of  pt+1  in  the  rational  expectations  equilibrium,  given  the  history  of  shocks. 
e
2.  Show  that  a  necessary  and  suﬃcient  condition  for  convergence  to  the 
REE  is

where

and 

ht  = 1 + (α − 1)/gt . 

3.  Show  that mt  satisﬁes

5.  Show  that  the  latter  condition  is  asymptotically  equivalent  to 
1/gt  = +∞.

6.  Does  the  learning  process  converge  to  the  REE  is  gt  is  a  constant?  If 
gt  = 1/(t + 1)2 ? 
7.  Assume  gt  = 1/(t + 1).  Show  that  (1)  is  satisﬁed  (hint:  use  (2)  and  look 
for  β  >  0  such  that  one  can  show  by  induction  that  mt  <  At−β  for  t  large 
enough). 
8.  Intuitively,  what  are  the  problems  if  gt  converges  ”too  fast”  or  ”too 
slowly”  to  inﬁnity?
