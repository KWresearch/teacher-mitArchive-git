By  induction  one  obtain 

1.  It is easy to check that pt  = εt  is the (bubbleless) REE equilibrium.  Next consider the 
learning  process.  Substituting  the model  equation  into  the  learning  equation  yields

by Apostol,  pp.  206–209.  One  direction  is  not  so  diﬃcult:  as  1 − an  ≤ e−an , we  have 
n=0 (1 − an ) ≤  e− 
n=0 an .  At  least  to  me  it  seems  that  the  other  direction  is  a  bit 
more  involved,  but  perhaps  you  found  an  easy  proof.  Otherwise  take  a  look  at  the
