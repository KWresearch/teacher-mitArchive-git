Problem  1   (Human  Capital  and  Incomplete  Markets) 
We  introduce   human  capital  in   the  model  of  Angeletos  and  Calvet  (2002)  that  we   discussed 
in  class.  Households  can   now  invest  in  two  types  of  capital:  Physical  capital,  denoted   by 
k  at  the  individual  level  and  K  at  the  aggregate;  and  human  capital,  denoted  by  h  at 
the  individual  level  and  H  at  the  aggregate.  For  simplity,  we  assume  that  the  are  no 
ﬁnancial   assets  other  than  the  riskless  bond;  that  there  is  no   exogenous  endowment;  and 
that   preferences  have  expected­utility  representation.  There  are  a  continuum  of  households.

1.  Solve   the   consumers  problem.   How  does  investment  in  physical  and  human  capital 
depend  on  the   variance  and  covariance  of  the  shocks? 

2.  In  the   special  case  that  σAB  = 0  and  α =  γ  = 1/2,  solve  explicitly   for  the  optimal  k 
and  h  as  functions  of   R  and  σA , σB . 

3.  Assume  σAB  =  0.  Does  the   optimal  k  depends  on  σB ?  Why,  or  why  not?

4.  Assume   σAB  =  0,  σA  = 0,  σB  >  0. What  is  the  eﬀect  of  a   higher   σB  on  the  optimal 
k  and  h,  given   R?  Consider  next   the  general  equilibrium,  where  we  endogenize  R 
through  the   Euler  condition   and  let  K  =  k , H  =  h.  Discuss  what  is  the   general 
equilibrium  eﬀect  of   σB  on  steady­state  K, H,  and  R.  (For  this  question,   intuition   is 
enough,  no  maths  are  necessary.) 

5.  Assume   again  σAB  =  0,  σA  = 0,  σB  >  0,  but  now  let  the  cash  on  hand  every  period  
be:

where   Ht  denotes  the  aggregate  human  capital  stock. 
Interpret  this  new  set­up. 
Characterize   the   optimal  k  and  h  as  functions  of  σB ,  R,  and  H.  How  does  σB  aﬀect 
the  choice  of  k  and  h,  given   R  and  H ?  Consider  next  the  general  equilibrium,  where 
we  endogenize  R  through   the   Euler  condition  and  let  K  =  k , H  =  h  in  equilibrium. 
Discuss  what  is  the  general  equilibrium  eﬀect  of  a   higher  σB  on  H  and  K .  (For  this 
question,  intuition  is  enough,  no   maths  are  necessariry.)

6.  In  the  light  of   the  above  results,  what  is  likely  to  be  the   eﬀect  of  higher  labor­income  
risks  on  physical­capital  accumulation  in  the  presence  of  human­capital  externalities? 

Problem   2  (based  on   Kiyotaki  and  Moore  (1997),  Midterm  Exam  2000)

Consider  an  economy   with   an   inﬁnity  of  time  periods  and  two  types  of  continuum  of  agents:

farmers  and  gatherers.  The  population  of  farmers  is  equal  to  unity.  There   are   also   two

goods:  an  ordinary  nondurable  product,  fruit,  and  a  durable  productive  asset,  land.  The 

¯
total  supply  of   land  is  equal  to  K .  The   farmer  has  a   constant   returns  to   scale  technology: 
he  uses   kt  units  of   date  t  land  to  produce  at+1kt  units  of  date  t +  1  fruit.  Each  farmer 
is  always   eager  to  expand   (due  to  their  great  enjoyment  of  farming),  but  faces  the  credit 
constraint,  which   implies  the  repayment  of  today’s  debt  (bt )  does  not  exceed  the  value  of 
land  tomorrow: 
Rbt  ≤ qt+1kt , 
(1) 
where  R  is  one  plus  real  interest  rate,  and  qt  is  land  price   in  terms  of  fruit.  The  farmer 
is  also  sub ject  to  the  ﬂow  of   funds  constraint,  which  implies  his  investment  expenditure   is 
ﬁnanced  by  his  output  and   net  borrowing: 
qt (kt  − kt−1 ) =  atkt−1  +  bt  − Rbt−1 . 
(2) 
The  gatherer’s  production  displays  decreasing  returns  to  scale;  they  use  k � units  of  date  
t 
� )  units  of  date  t +  1  fruit.  The   gatherer  maximizes  the  expected  
t  land  to  produce  G(kt
discounted   consumption   of  fruit  with  discount  factor   R−1  <  1.   This  together  with  land 
market  equilibrium,  implies  that  the  residual  supply  of  land  to   the  farmers  satisﬁes: 
qt  − 
qt+1  =  G� (K − kt ) =  αk t  ,

where  η > 0  is  the   elasticity  of  the  residual   supply  of  land  with  respect  to   the  opportunity 
cost  of   holding  land,  and   α is  a  positive  parameter. 

1.  Describe  the   steady  state   equilibrium  of  the  above  economy  for  at  =  a. 
2.  Suppose   that  the  economy   is  at  the  steady  state  at  date  t − 1  for  some  value   of  a, 
say  a1 .  Suppose  that  the   value  of  a unanticipatedly   increases  to  a2  > a1  permanently 
from  date  t.  Describ e  the  equilibrium   path   of  the   economy. 

Problem   3  (Savings  with  Incomplete  Markets,  General   Exam  2001)

Consider  the   following  OLG   economy  with  incomplete  markets.  Each  individual  lives  for

two  periods.  Population   is  constant.   Each  generation  consists  of  a  continuum  of  individuals.

y
o 
Individuals  within  a   generation   t  are   indexed  by  h.  Let  ct (h)  and 
ct+1 (h
)  denote  the
consumption  of  an   individual  h born  in  period  t,  when  she   is  young  and  when   she  is  old, 
respectively.  Preferences  are  given  by: 
EtUt (h) =  log  ct (h) +   βEt [log   c 
y
o
)], 
t+1 (h
(1)
where  β > 0  and  Et  denotes  expectations.  During  her  youth,  an  individual  receives  a  ﬁxed 
y (h)  =  1.  Part  of  this  endowment   is  consumed  and  part  is  saved  for  the  next 
endowment:  yt
period.   Let  kt (h)  denote   savings.  Therefore,  the  budget  of  an  individual  during  youth  is: 

yct (h) +  kt (h)  = 1. 

(2) 

Each  individual  invests  her  savings  either  in  a   safe  storage   technology,   or  in  a   risky  en­
trepreneurial  pro ject.  If  the  individual  specializes  in  the  storage  technology,  her   consump­
tion  during  retirement  is: 

o ct+1 (h) =  δkt (h) 
where  δ  >  0  is  constant.  If  instead  the  individual  chooses  to  specialize  in  the  risky  en­
trepreneurial  pro ject,  her  consumption  during  retirement  is:  

(3) 

o ct+1 (h) =  A˜
t+1 (h)kt (h).

˜
The  return  At+1 (h)  is  speciﬁc   to  individual   h.   It  is  i.i.d.  across  individuals,   i.i.d.   across 
time,  and  distributed  as  follows: 

1 
A +  σ  with  probability   2 
A − σ  with  probability  1

where  A =  E[A]  > δ > 0;  and   σ ≥  0.   Finally,  deﬁne  gt  as  the  (gross)  growth  rate  in  the
