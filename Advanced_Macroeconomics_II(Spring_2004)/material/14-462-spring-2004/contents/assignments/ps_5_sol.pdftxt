We  have  θ  =  log 
and  θ  =  log(c).  If  θ  <  θ ,  then  it  is  best  not  to  invest  even  if

everybody  else  does.  If  θ ≥ θ ,  then  it  is  optimal  to  invest  even  if  nobody  else  does.

In  a monotone  equilibrium  for  each  value  of  z  there  is  a  threshold x∗ (z )  such  that  an 
agent  invests  if  and  only  if  x  ≥ x∗ (z ).  For  a  given  value  of  θ  and  z ,  the  fraction  of 
agents  investing  is  then  given  by

be  the expected utility  from  investing conditional on having observed  signals x and z 
if  the  threshold  of  other  agents  for  investing  is  x∗ .  To  be  an  equilibrium,  x∗ (z ) must 
satisfy H (x∗ (z ), x∗ (z ), z ) = 0.  Since

2.  Now we’re looking for monotone equilibria of the second stage.  This problem is almost 
the  problem  considered  in  class  with  one  complication:  agents  that  have  decided  to 
attack  in  the  ﬁrst  stage  cannot  reverse  their  decision.  There  are  now  two  situations 
that can occur in the second stage.  Either some agents joint the attack,  in which case 
all agents with private signal below some threshold x∗
I ( ˜z ) participate in the attack and 
the  agent  with  signal  x∗
I ( ˜z )  is  indiﬀerent.  Or  nobody  joins  the  attack,  so  everybody 
below  x∗
1  participates  in  the  attack  but  an  agent with  signal  x∗
1  is  not  indiﬀerent  but 
would  rather  not  attack  but  cannot  reverse  his  decision.  In  either  case  there  is  a 
threshold  x∗ z )  below  which  agents  participate  in  the  attack.  Then  the  overall  size 
p ( ˜

of  the  attack  is  given  by


A(θ, z˜) = Φ(

The  function X  is strictly  increasing.  Let θ∗ z ) be the  level of  fundamentals at which 
p ( ˜
the  inequality  above  holds  with  equality,  that  is  X (θ∗ z ))  =  x∗ z ).  Then  regime 
p ( ˜
p ( ˜
change  occurs  if  and  only  if  θ  ≤  θ∗ z ).  Let’s  write  Θ  =  X −1 ,  then  we  can  write 
p ( ˜
θ∗ z ) = Θ(x∗ z )).  That  is,  for  a  given  participation  threshold  x∗ z ),  the  function  Θ 
p ( ˜
p ( ˜
p ( ˜
will  give  us  the  threshold  of  fundamentals  below  which  regime  change  occurs. 
Now  let H (x∗ z ), x, z˜)  be  the  expected  utility  from  attacking  of  an  agent  conditional 
p ( ˜
on  having  observed  a  private  signal  x  and  a  public  signal  ˜z  if  all  other  agents  below 
the  participation  threshold  x∗ z )  participate  in  the  attack.  So 
p ( ˜
H (x∗ z ), x, z˜) ≡ bP [θ ≤ Θ(x∗ z )) x, z˜] − c.

In  the  standard  Morris-Shin  model  the  set  of  equilibria  is  given  by  the  solutions  to 
the  equation 

H (x, x, z˜) = 0 

Here  things  are  a  bit  more  involved  due  to  irreversibility.  First  suppose  there  is  a 
αx  ≤ √

unique  solution  to  this  equation.  Here  the  condition  that  insures  uniqueness  for  all

2π , which can be written as αz

precise private signal now also helps to generate multiplicity, because this means that 
the public  signal  is more precise.  If  this condition  fails  there  is a  range of values  [z , z¯] 
for  ˜z  over which  there  is multiplicity.  For now we have assumed  that we’re outside of

which  turn  out  to  be  the  the  same  in  this  case.  First  there  is  the  threshold  below 
which  agents  participate  in  the  attack,  denoted  as  x∗ z )  which  is  equal  to  x∗ z )  in 
p ( ˜

Now  suppose  we  are  in  the  case  of  multiplicity.  I  will  focus  on  the  typical  case  with

three  solutions  to  the  equation  H (x, x, z˜) =  0,  the  extension  to  the  borderline  cases

We  have  determined  all  the  pieces  in  this  equation  and  can  now  compute  equilibria 
numerically.  I  haven’t  attempted  to  prove whether  the  solution  for  x∗

given  selection  of  second  stage  equilibria,  but  in my  numerical  examples  it  is. 
First  I  compute  some  equilibria  for  the  parameter  values  αx  =  1,  αz  =  3  (so  the 
condition  for  multiplicity  is  satisﬁed),  β  = 0.8,  b  =  1  and  c  = 0.5.  I  compute  two 
equilibria.  In  the  ﬁrst  I  select  the  lowest  second  stage  equilibrium  for  all  values  of  ˜z , 
in  the  second  I  always  select  the  highest  second  stage  equilibrium.  Figures  3  and  4

people  would  be more  willing  to  join  the  attack  in  the  second  stage.
