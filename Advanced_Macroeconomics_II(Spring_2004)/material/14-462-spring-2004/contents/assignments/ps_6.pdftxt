Problem  1 
The  economy  is  populated  by  a  continuum  of  measure  one  of  agents,  indexed  by  i  and 
uniformly  distributed  over  the  [0, 1]  interval.  Agents  are  risk  neutral  with  utility

� 
where  ki  is  the  individual  investment  of  agent  i,  A  is  the  return  to  investment,  and 
the  cost  of  investment.  Let 
0 
denote  the  aggregate  level  of  investment.  The  return  to  investment  is  given  by

A = (1 − α)θ + αK 
where α ∈

2 The random variable θ parametrizes the fundamentals of the economy.  If

α > 0  there  is  a  complementarity  in  that  the  return  to  individual  investment  is  increasing 
in  the  aggregate  level  of  investment,  and  the  parameter  α  captures  the  degree  of  comple­ 

mentarity. 

The  fundamentals  θ  are  not  known  at  the  time  investment  decisions  are  made.  Further­ 

more,  agents  have  heterogeneous  beliefs  about  θ .  The  common  prior  is  uniform  over  R.

Agent  i  has  private  information


K  =

and  there  is  public  information 

xi  = θ + σxξi 

y = K + σy u. 
The  random  variables  ξi ,  i ∈  [0, 1]  and  u  are  standard  normal  and  independent  as  well  as 
independent of θ.  The precisions of the two sources of information are denoted as πx  = σ−2 ,

1.  Check  that  it  is  an  equilibrium  for  investment  to  takes  the  form 
ki  = βxi  + (1 − β )y . 

Determine the coeﬃcient β  and describe how  it varies with the degree of complemen­
tarity  α  and  the  two  precisions  πx  and  πy .  Provide  an  intuitive  explanation  of  your 
ﬁndings.

2.  How do heterogeneity Var(ki θ, y) and volatility Var(K θ) vary with the three param­
eters  α,  πx  and  πy .  Provide  intuition.

3.  Show  that  social  welfare  conditional  on  fundamentals  E[w θ ]  is  a  linear  function  of 
heterogeneity  and  volatility.  Use  your  previous  results  to  discuss  how  social  welfare 
varies  with  the  parameters  and  provide  intuition  for  your  results. 

4.  Now  suppose  there  is  a  second  source  of  public  information


z = θ + σz ε

where  ε  is  standard  normal  and  independent  of  θ ,  u  and  the  ξi ,  i  ∈  [0, 1].  How  are 
the  answers  to  parts  1.-3.  aﬀected? 

Problem  2  (A  simple Model  of  Savings)

∞� 
Consider  the  problem  of  a  consumer  who  wants  to maximize  the  following  program:

β t  c 1−γ 
t 
E 
max 
1 − γ 
{ct }∞
t=0 
t=0 
s.t.  (i)  wt  =  et  + Rtbt 
wt  =  ct  + bt+1 
(ii)  wo  >  0 

(1) 

(2) 

The  endowment  shock  et  and  the  interest  rate  Rt  are  i.i.d.  Don’t  worry  about  the  non-
negativity  constraint  on  consumption. 

1.  Rewrite  the  problem  in  recursive  form. 

2.  Without  solving  for  the  value  function,  derive  the  ﬁrst  order  condition  (FOC)  and 
the  envelope  condition  (EC).  Combine  the  two  to  obtain  the  Euler  Equation  (EE). 

3.  Assume  in  this  section  that  the  endowment  shock  is  0  in  all  periods.  Make  a  guess 
for  a  value  function.  Using  this  guess,  derive  the  consumption  function.  Using  the 
EE,  solve  for  the  constant.  Then  replace  back  into  the  Bellman  equation,  and  verify 
that  you  indeed  found  the  value  function.

4.  Assume  now  that  the  endowment  shock  is  stochastic,  and  that  the  interest  rate  is 
deterministic  and  Rt  =  R.  Use  the  EE  to  analyze  consumption  growth.  What 
happens  if  Rβ  =  1?  What  is  the  R  that  makes  expected  consumption  growth  zero? 
Discuss  the  implications  of  uninsurable  risk. 

5.  Assume  that  Rt  is  stochastic,  and  that  the  consumer  is  the  representative  agent  of 
the  economy.  Assume  that  endowment  is  stochastic,  and  that  the  asset  is  in  zero net 
supply.  Use  the EE  to price  the asset when  there  is only aggregate  risk.  Discuss  (but 
do  not  solve)  the  case  with  only  idiosyncratic  risk. 

6.  Now  assume  that  there  is  no  uncertainty,  that  the  interest  rate  is  constant,  and  the 
endowment  shock  0.  Solve  for  the  value  function,  and  the  optimal  consumption  and 
wealth  path  as  a  function  of  initial  wealth.  Using  the  optimal  consumption  path 
that  you  derived  from  the  recursive  approach,  derive  the  value  function  by  replacing 
consumption  in  expected utility.  What  condition  in  γ  do you need  to make  sure  that 
the  solution  is  indeed  optimal?  Discuss.
