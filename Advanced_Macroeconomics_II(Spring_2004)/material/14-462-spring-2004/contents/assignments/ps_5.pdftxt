(due  April  12) 

Problem  1 
There  is  a  measure-one  continuum  of  agents,  indexed  by  i ∈ [0, 1].  Each  agent  can  choose 
between two actions.  The action of agent i is denoted as ki  ∈ {0, 1}, where ki  = 0 represents 
“not  invest”  and  ki  =  1  represents  “invest”.  All  agents  move  simultaneously.  The  utility 
� 
of  agent  i  is  given  by 
ui  = U (ki , K, θ) = e θ ki (1 + K γ ) − cki 
kidi  denotes  the mass  of  agents  investing. 
where  θ  reﬂects  “fundamentals”  and K  = 
1.  Suppose  that  θ  is  commonly  known  by  all  agents.  What  is  the  best  response  g(K, θ) 
(agents  are  assumed  not  invest  in  case  of  indiﬀerence)?  Derive  the  thresholds  θ  and 
¯θ  such  that:  (i)  all  agents  not  investing  is  the  unique  equilibrium  for  θ  <  θ ;  (ii)  all 
agents  investing  is  the  unique  equilibrium  for  θ ≥ θ  and  (iii)  for  intermediate  values

[θ , θ)  there  are multiple  equilibria. 

From  now  on  assume  that  agent  i  observes  a  private  signal 

with  ξi  ∼ N (0, σ 2 
x ).  All  agents  also  observes  an  exogenous  public  signal 

xi  = θ + ξi 

z = θ + ε 
where  ε ∼ N (0, σz 
2 ).  Let  αx  =  σ−2  and  αz  =  σ−2 .  Agents  have  a  common  prior  about  θ ,
z 
x
which  is uniform  over  the  entire  real  line.  Equilibrium  is deﬁned  as  follows:  a  strategy  k(·) 
and  an  aggregate  investment K (·)  constitute  an  equilibrium  if

The  remainder  of  the  exercise  asks  you  to  numerically  compute  monotone  equilibria,  that 
is,  equilibria  in  which  k(x, z )  is  monotone  in  x.  In  a  monotone  equilibrium,  for  any  real­
ization  of  z ,  there  is  a  threshold  x∗ (z )  such  that  an  agent  invests  if  and  only  if  x ≥ x∗ (z ). 
Throughout,  set  γ  = 0.8  and  c = 2.

2.  Set αx  = 10 and αz  = 1.  Over a range of values for z (somewhat wider than [θ , θ ]) plot 
the  equilibrium  thresholds  x∗ (z ).  Are  there  values  of  z  for  which  there  are  multiple 
equilibrium  thresholds? 

3.  Repeat part 2.  for the values αx  = 1 and αz  = 10.  Compute the range  [z , z¯) of values 
of  z  for  which  there  is multiplicity. 

4.  Fix  αx  at  one.  What  happens  to  the  range  [z , z¯)  as  αz  becomes  large? 

Problem  2 
Consider  the  following  two  stage  version  of Morris-Shin.  The  utility  of  agent  i  is  given  by 
ui  = a1,i (Rb − c) + β a2,i (Rb − c) 
Here  a1,i  ∈ {0, 1} is  the  action  of  agent  i  in  the  ﬁrst  stage  and  a2,i  ∈ {0, 1} is  the  action  of 
agent  i  in  the  second  stage.  For  both  actions,  a  value  of  one  represents  “attack”  while  a 
� 
value  of  zero  represents  “not  attack”.  The  regime  outcome  is  denoted  as  R,  where  R =  0 
� 
represents  survival  of  the  status quo  and R = 1  represents  collapse.  The decision  to  attack 
is  irreversible:  a1,i  =  1  implies  a2,i  =  1.  Let  A1  = 
a1,idi  be  mass  of  agents  attacking  in 
a2,i (1 − a1,i )di  be  the mass  of  agents  that  did  not  attack  in  the 
the  ﬁrst  stage.  Let  A2  = 
ﬁrst  stage  but  join  the  attack  in  the  second  stage.  The  timing  is  as  follows.  First  agent 
i  observes  a  private  signal  xi  =  θ + ξi  where  ξi  ∼  N (0, σ 2 
x )  and  αx  =  σ−2 .  Then  agents 
x 
simultaneously  choose  their  ﬁrst  stage  actions  a1,i .  Then  agents  observe  the  public  signal 
z  = Φ−1 (A1 ) + v  where  v  ∼ N (0, σz 
2 )  and  αz  =  σ−2 .  The  status  quo  collapses  (R  =  1)  if 
z 
A1  + A2  ≥ θ .  The  goal  is  to  characterize  the monotone  equilibria  of  this model. 
1.  First note  that agent  i will attack  in  the ﬁrst period  if xi  ≤ x∗ for  some  threshold x∗
1 . 
1 
What  is  the  mass  of  agents  choosing  to  attack  in  the  ﬁrst  period  as  a  function  of  θ , 
denoted  as  A1 (θ)?  Plug  the  function  A1 (θ)  into  the  expression  for  the  public  signal 
z .  What  are  the  properties  of  z  as  a  signal  about  θ? 
2.  Given a ﬁrst period threshold x∗
1 , characterize the second stage equilibrium thresholds 
x∗
2 (z ).  Under  what  condition  on  αz  and  αx  is  their multiplicity? 

3.  Now move  back  to  the  ﬁrst  stage  and  analyze  the monotone  equilibria  of  the model. 
Discuss multiplicity  and  how  it  is  related  to  the  precision  parameters  αz  and  αx  and 
the  discount  rate  β .
