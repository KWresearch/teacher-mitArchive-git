Problem  set  1 

When  does  it  pay  to  use  two  technologies  at  the  same  time? 
Assume  that  output  can  be  produced  using  two  technologies,  labelled  by  1 
and  2.  The  production  functions  are  given  by 
αL1−α 
Y1  = K1

k2  =

Y2  = K2 L1−β

1.  Show  that  if  the  two  technologies  are  used,  the  capital  labor  ratio  in 
�	 1−α

technology  2  must  be  equal  to 
1 − α

Show  that  this  entirely  determines  factor  prices  and  the  allocation  of  labor 
and  capital  between  the  two  technologies. 
2.  Show  that  if  α  = 1/3,  β  = 2/3,  total  capital  is  K  and  total  labor  is  L, 
then

3.  Between  which  bounds must  the  aggregate K/L  lie  for  the  two  technolo­
gies  to  be  used  in  equilibrium? 
4.  Show  that  if  K/L  is  between  these  two  bounds,  then  they  will  actually 
be  used  in  equilibrium. 
5.  Can  you  explain  what  is  going  on  in  the  (K, L)  plane?
