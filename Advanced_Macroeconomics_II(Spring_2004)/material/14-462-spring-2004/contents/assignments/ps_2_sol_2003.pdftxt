Problem  1  (Human  Capital  and  Incomplete Markets) 

1.  The  Bellman  equation  is 
V (w) =  max  {U (c) + βE[V (w � )]}
� 
c,k,h,w
Bhγ  + R(w − c − k − h). 
s.t.  w �  = Akα  + ˜

Now


Notice that to simplify notation I do not give k  and h a prime although they are next 
period  variables.  A  natural  guess  for  the  value  function  is 
1 
V (w) = − 
exp(−Γ(aw + b)). 
aΓ 
In  order  to  perform  the  optimization  we  need  to  evaluate  E[V (w ]).  We  have 
E[w � ] = Akα  + Bhγ  + R(w − c − k − h),

Notice  that  the  level  of  wealth  does  not  appear  in  these  equations,  so  the  optimal 
� 
choice  of  k  and  h  is  independent  of  the  state  w .  Denote  the  solutions  to  this  system 
of  equations  as  k∗ (a)  and  h∗ (a).  Now  deﬁne  the  function 
� 
log(βR) − Γa[Ak∗ (a)α  + Bh∗ (a)γ  − R(k∗ (a) + h∗ (a))]

Then  the  ﬁrst  order  condition  for  consumption  can  be  rewritten  as

Note  that  the  consumption  function  can  now  be  written  as  c = aw + b. 
Now  let’s  analyze  how  investment  in  physical  and  human  captial  depends  on  the 
variance and covariance of  shocks.  Totally diﬀerentiating the ﬁrst order condition  for

σAB  > 0  and  negative  if  σAB  < 0.  If  human  capital  becomes more  risky  and  the  two 
returns  are  positively  correlated,  then  physical  capital  is  relatively  more  attractive 
and  investment  in  physical  capital  increases.  Now  suppose  that  the  correlation  of 
the  returns  is negative and human  capital becomes more  risky.  Investment  in human 
capital shrinks.  As human capital provides insurance for physical capital, the amount 
of  insurance  of  physical  capital  shrinks  and  so  physical  capital  investment  is  reduced 
as  well.

3.  When  σAB  = 0,  investment  in  the  two  diﬀerent  capital  stocks  is  independent. 

and  solving  for  k  we  obtain


and  by  symmetry 

R = 

k =

4.  From our previous calculations we know that  if σAB  = 0, σA  = 0 and σB  > 0,  then an 
increase in σB  leaves investment in physical capital unaﬀected and reduces investment 
in  human  capital. 
To  derive  the  Euler  equation,  ﬁrst  compute  the  envelope  condition  as  V � (w) = 
βRE[V � (w � )]  and  recall  that  the  ﬁrst  order  condition  for  consumption  is  U � (c) = 
βRE[V � (w � )].  Combining  these  two  equations  we  have  V � (w) = U � (c)  and  thus 
U � (c) = βRE[U � (c� )]. 

With  our  functional  form  for  U  this  becomes 
exp(−Γc) = βRE[exp(−Γc� )] 
� 
�
As  c�  = aw �  + b  it  is  normally  distributed  and  so 
1 
exp(−Γc) = βR exp  −ΓE[c� ] +  Γ2Var(c� )

Taking  logs  and  rearranging  yields

E[c� ] − c = 

Moreover Var(c� ) = Var(aw � + b) = a2Var(w � )  and with  σAB  = 0  and  σA  = 0 we  have

Var(w � ) = σ 2 h2γ .  Using  these  facts  the  Euler  equation  can  be  rewritten  as

determines R and H  in steady state.  We want to know how this depends on σ 2 
B .  Note 
that σ 2 
B  enters  these  equations  in  two places.  In  the Euler  equation  idiosyncratic  risk 
in human  capital  investment  creates  a precautionary  savings  eﬀect.  In  the ﬁrst  order 
condition  for  human  capital  in  exerts  a  direct  negative  investment  eﬀect. 
The  eﬀect  of  σ 2  on  R  and  H  is  ambiguous.  Let’s  consider  the  scenario  which  An-
B 
geletos  and  Calvet  would  consider  the  most  likely.  So  suppose  from  now  on  that  in 
the Euler  equation  the  direct  eﬀect  precautionary  savings  eﬀect  of  σ 2  on R  wins  out 
B 
and  R  is  decreasing  in  σ 2 
B .  From  the  ﬁrst  oder  equation  for  human  capital  we  can 
˜
write  H  = H (R, σ 2 
B ).  The  direct  investment  eﬀect  tends  to  reduce  investment.  But
through  the  precautionary  savings  eﬀect  σ 2  reduces  the  interest  rate  which  tends  to 
B 
increase  investment  in  human  capital.  Investment  in  human  capital  will  fall  if  the 
investment  eﬀect  dominates.  Investment  in  physical  captial  will  increase  with  the 
reduction  in  the  interest  rate  caused  by  the  precautionary  savings  eﬀect,  so  the  gen­
eral  equilbrium  eﬀect  of  an  increase  in  the  idiosyncratic  risk  in  human  capital  is  to 
increase  investment  in  physical  capital. 

5.  The human capital externality aﬀects the ﬁrst order condition  for capital  investment, 
which  now  becomes


R = αAH η kα−1 
¯

Maintaining  our  assumptions  about  which  eﬀects  dominate  from  the  previous  part, 
an  increase  in  σ 2  reduces  both  R  and  H .  Thus  we  have  two  opposing  eﬀects  on 
B 

5 

investment  in  physical  capital.  The  precautionary  savings  eﬀect  tends  to  increase 
investment  in  physical  capital,  but  the  reduction  in  human  capital  investment  tends 
to  reduce  physical  capital  investment  through  the  externality. 

6.  If  labor  income  risk  corresponds  to  riskiness  in  human  capital  investments,  and  if 
human capital externalities are strong,  then physical capital accumulation  is  likely to 
be  reduced. 

Problem  2  (based  on  Kiyotaki  and Moore  (1997), Midterm  Exam  2000) 

1.  Before  solving  the  problem  I’ll  discuss  where  equation  (3)  comes  from.  If  a  gatherer 
buys  a  unit  of  land,  he  pays  qt  today.  His  output  tomorrow  increases  by  G� (kt
� )  and 
the  unit  of  land  can  be  resold  for  qt+1 .  As  the  discount  factor  is  R−1 ,  we  get  the 
condition 
� ) + qt+1 
G� (kt
qt  = 
R 
Now  using  the  market  clearing  condition  kt  + k � =  K  to  replace  k � and  rearraning 
¯

slightly  yields  the  ﬁrst  equality  of  equation  (3).  The  second  equality  is  simply  a 
convenient  functional  form  assumption.  Farmers  are  always  eager  to  expand,  so  the 
borrowing  constraint  will  always  be  binding  unless  there  are  surprises.  In  particular 
the  borrowing  constraint  will  be  binding  in  steady  state.  The  steady  state  versions 
of  (1),(2)  and  (3)  are

so  the  steady  state  price  of  land  is  q∗  = a R−1 .  Substituting  this  result  into  the  third

Problem  3  (Savings  with  Incomplete Markets, General  Exam  2001) 

1.  If  individual  h  specializes  in  storage,  then 
EtUt (h) =  log(1 − kt (h)) + βEt [log(δkt (h))]

technology.  If  we  had  σ  =  σ ,  then  the  individual  would  be  indiﬀerent  between  the 
risky  pro ject  and  the  storage  technology.  So  ˆ

If  the  storage  technology  has  a  better  return,  then  the  risky  pro ject  must  become 
less  risky  to  keep  the  individual  indiﬀerent.  If  the  average  return  of  the  risky  pro ject

Now  consider  B  as  a  function  of  σ ,  writing  B (σ).  Then  B (0)  =  A,  B ( ˆ

being  indiﬀerent  if  σ  =  σ .  Let’s  assume  that  the  risky  pro ject  is  chosen  in  the  case 
of  indiﬀerence.


3.  I  think  that  the  idea  of  this question was  to  get  at what  the  risk  adjusted  real  return 
in  the  economy,  and  that  would  be 

R = max[B (σ), δ ], 

σ  and  R = δ  for  σ >  ˆ
so  R = B (σ)  for  σ <  ˆ
σ . 
But  if  we  really  allow  a  risk-free  bond  to  be  traded,  then  things  are  a  bit  more 
complicated.  While  it  was  impossible  to  invest  in  both  the  storage  technology  and 
the  risky  pro ject  at  the  same  time,  it  would  now  be  possible  to  invest  in  the  riskless 
asset  and  the  risky  pro ject  at  the  same  time. 
Let’s compute the equilibrium real interest rate under the assumption that individuals

invest  in  the  risky  pro ject  but  not  in  storage,  but  may  want  to  invest  in  the  riskless 
asset.  The  equilibrium  real  interest  rate must make  the demand  for  the  riskless asset 
equal  to  zero  because  the  asset  is  in  zero  net  supply. 
The problem of  the  individual  is  to choose  the  risky  investment kt (h) and  investment 
in  the  riskless  asset  bt (h)  to maximize

We  can  combine  them  to  obtain 
A + σ − R
A − σ − R 
(A − σ)kt (h) + Rbt (h) 
(A + σ)kt (h) + Rbt (h)
Now  in  equilibrium  it must  be  the  case  that  bt (h) = 0,  so  this  condition  reduces  to 
A + σ − R A − σ − R 
+ 
(A − σ) 
(A + σ)
Solving  this  for  R  and  expressing  the  result  as  a  function  of  σ  we  get 
(A + σ)(A − σ) 
. 
A 
Notice  that R(σ) < B (σ).  This makes  a  lot  of  sense.  If  the  interest  rate where B (σ), 
then  a  risk  adjusted  return  of  B (σ)  could  be  achieved  simply  by  putting  everything 
into  the  riskless  asset.  But  by  combining  the  risky  pro ject  with  some  of  the  riskless 
asset,  it would be possible  to do  strictly better  then B (σ).  But with  the  interest  rate 
R(σ) above,  it  is undesirable to put anything  into the riskless asset, and then the risk 
adjusted return is one again B (σ).  Once again this is an equilibrium only if B (σ) ≥ δ 
or  equivalently  σ  ≤  ˆσ ,  because  otherwise  given  the  interest  rate  R(σ)  it  would  be 
optimal  to  put  all  savings  into  the  storage  technology  (using  the  riskless  asset would 
be  inferior  as  B (σ) ≥ δ  implies  R(σ) < δ). 
Now  suppose  that  σ >  ˆσ .  Is  it  an  equilibrium  for  all  individuals  to  invest  in  storage? 
If  so,  then  the  interest  rate  must  be  R  =  δ .  But  if  the  interest  rate  is  δ ,  then  an 
individual  could  get  a  risk  adjusted  return  higher  then  δ  by  combining  the  riskless 
asset  and  a  little  bit  of  the  risky  pro ject.  So  investing  in  storage  can  never  be  an 
equilibrium,  and  consequently  an  equilibrium  does  not  exist  if  σ >  ˆσ . 
So  from  now  on  let’s  just  consider  R(σ) = max[B (σ), δ ]. 

R(σ) =

The  growth  rate  of  consumption  varies  with  σ  only  as  long  as  σ  <  ˆσ .  If  θ  <  1, 
then  an  increase  in  σ  will  reduce  R(σ)  and  thus  consumption  growth.  If  θ > 1, 
then  consumption  growth  is  increasing  in  σ .  Of  course  in  both  cases  there  is 
still  a  downward  jump  at  ˆ
σ .  An  increase  in  γ  shortens  the  intervall  [0, ˆ
σ ]  in 
which g(σ) varies with σ , and the counterpart of this is that within this intervall 
consumption  growth  becomes more  sensitive  to  changes  in  σ

τK  is  the  tax  rate  on  capital  income,  τL  the  tax  rate  on  labor  income,  and  v  a  lump-sum
