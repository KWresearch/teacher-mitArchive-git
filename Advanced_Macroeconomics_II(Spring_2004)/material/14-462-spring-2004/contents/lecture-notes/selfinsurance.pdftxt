1 Self Insurance

• Exogenous stochastic income stream yt . yt is i.i.d., with support [ymin , ymax ],
ymax > ymin ≥ 0, and c.d.f. Ψ.
• Preferences:

∞Xt=0
E0U = E0
where U 0 > 0 > U 00 ; and, unless otherwise stated, U 0 (0) = ∞, U 0 (∞) = 0.
• Budget and borrowing constraint:
ct + at = (1 + r)at−1 + yt

β tU (ct)

which implies

ct ≥ 0
at ≥ 0

ct ≤ (1 + r)at + yt+1
1

• Remark: We could relax borrowing constraint to
at ≥ −bt
where bt is the borrowing limit. Either exogenous to the economy; or endoge-
nous.

E.g.:

• Deﬁne cash in hand as

It follows that

and

bt = inf
{yt+j }∞j=0

ymin
r

∞Xj=0
(1 + r)−(j+1)yt+j =
zt ≡ (1 + r)at + yt

zt+1 = (1 + r)(zt − ct) + yt+1

0 ≤ ct ≤ zt
• We write the Belman equation as:

U (c) + β

V (z) = max
0≤c≤z
s.t.

EV ( ˜z)
z
{
}|
Z V ( ˜z) dΨ(y )
˜z = (1 + r)(z − c) + y
We denote by C (z ) the arg max of the above and A(z ) = z − C (z ).
• The value function V is the ﬁxed point of the corresponding operator. Obvi-
ously, V inherits the properties of U. That is, V 0 > 0 > V 00 , V 0 (0) = −∞,
V 0 (∞) = 0. Also, C (z) and A(z) are non-decreasing.
• The FOC:

U 0 (ct) ≥ β (1 + r)EtV 0 (zt+1), = if ct < zt

The Envelope Condition:

V 0 (zt ) = U 0 (ct )

Euler equation:

Alternatively

U 0 (ct ) ≥ β (1 + r)EtU 0 (ct+1), = if ct < zt

V 0 (zt ) ≥ β (1 + r)EtV 0 (zt+1), = if Etzt+1 > (1 + r)zt + Etyt+1
1.1 Random Walk and Precautionary Motive

• Consider β (1 + r) = 1, that is, that is, r = ρ ≡ β −1 − 1. If there were no
uncertainty (and eventually no binding borrowing constraint), then

U 0 (ct ) = U 0 (ct+1 )

or V 0 (zt ) = V 0 (zt+1 )

implying

ct+1 = ct = c∗

and zt+1 = zt = z ∗

• Suppose now that there is risk in consumption, but there is no borrowing con-
straint and r = ρ. Then, the Euler condition impies

EtU 0 (ct+1) = U 0 (ct )

and

EtV 0 (zt+1 ) = V 0 (zt)

If in addition utility is quadratic, implying that U 0 and V 0 are linear, then

Et ct+1 = ct

and

Etzt+1 = zt

That is, consumption and wealth follow a random walk.

• But if U 000 > 0 and Vart ct+1 > 0, then EtU 0 (ct+1) = U 0 (ct ) implies
Et ct+1 > ct

The precautionary motive for saving.

1.2 The Uc Supermartingale
• Consider again the general case. Deﬁne
Mt ≡ β t (1 + r)tU 0 (ct) = β t (1 + r)tV 0 (zt)
Then, by the Euler condition,

Et(Mt+1 − Mt) ≤ 0
That is, Mt is a supermartingale. Because Mt is non-negative (actually strictly
positive), the supermartingale convergence theorem applies. The latter states
that Mt converges almost surely to a non-negative random variable M∞ , Mt →a.s.
M∞ .
• Suppose β (1 + r) > 1, that is, r > ρ ≡ β −1 − 1. Then, the fact that Mt
converges a.s. while β t(1 + r)t diverges to +∞ implies that U 0 (ct) = V 0 (zt )
must a.s. converge to 0. That is, ct and zt diverge a.s. to +∞.
• Suppose next β (1 + r) = 1, that is, r = ρ ≡ β−1 − 1. We want to argue again
that ct and zt diverge a.s. to ∞. Suppose to the contrary that there is some
upper limmit zmax < ∞ such that zt+1 ≤ zmax = (1 + r)A(zmax ) + ymax . At
zt = zmax , then

V 0 (zt ) ≥ β (1 + r)EtV 0 (zt+1) ⇒
V 0 (zmax) ≥ EtV 0 ((1 + r)A(zmax ) + yt+1)
yt+1{V 0 ((1 + r)A(zmax) + yt+1 )} =
> inf
= V 0 ((1 + r)A(zmax ) + ymax ) = V 0 (zmax).

That is, V 0 (zmax ) > V 0 (zmax), which is a contradiction. The resolution is
VartV 0 (zt+1) = 0, which requires either the variance of yt+1 to vanish, or other-
wise zt+1 to diverge a.s. to +∞.

• Suppose ﬁnally β (1 + r) < 1, that is, r = ρ ≡ β−1 − 1. Then, as long as
VartV 0 (zt+1) = VartU 0 (ct+1) remains ﬁnite, then Mt will automatically converge
a.s. to zero, and we are ﬁne.

• We conclude that A(z0) = ∞ if r ≥ ρ, but A(z0) can be ﬁnite if r < ρ. With
CARA, there is a unique r < ρ for which A(z0) is ﬁnite. With deminishin ARA
(such as CRRA), A(z0) is ﬁnite for every r < ρ.

• For stochastic r, Chamberlain and Wilson (1984/2000) prove that z diverges to
inﬁnite as long as Er exceeds ρ.

2 CARA-Normal Example

2.1 Individual behavior

• Suppose β (1 + r) < 1.
• Suppose yt ∼ N (y , σ2).
• Suppose CARA preferences,
1
exp(−Γc)
U (c) = −
Γ
U 0 (c) = exp(−Γc)
• Show that there are a, b, ˆa, ˆb such that
V (z ) = − exp(−ˆaz − ˆb)
C (z ) = az + b

• Because c is normal and U 0 is exponential,
EtU 0 (ct+1 ) = U 0 (Et ct+1 − ΓVart (ct+1)/2)
5

• The Euler condition,

thus reduces to

U 0 (ct ) = β (1 + r)EtU 0 (ct+1 ),

Etct+1 − ct =

ln[β (1 + r)] +

Vart (ct+1 )

• Combining with C (z) = az + b and Vart (zt+1 ) = σ2 , we infer Vart (ct+1 ) = a2σ2
and thus

Etct+1 − ct =

• For a steady state, Et ct+1 − ct = 0, we thus need

ln[β (1 + r)] = −

a2σ2

that is

r = ρe−(Γaσ)2 /2 < ρ

• Hence, the resolution to the risk-free rate puzzle.

2.2 Moving from CARA to CRRA

• A disturbing property of our CARA speciﬁcation is that risk aversion is inde-
pendent of wealth. Indeed, absolute risk aversion is Γ, but relative risk aversion
is Γct . It is more reasonable to assume that relative rather than absolute risk
aversion is constant. Therefore, lets us ﬁx Γct = γ , that is, calibrate Γ as
Γ = γ /ct , where γ measures relative risk aversion.

• Then, the Euler condition becomes
Et ct+1

ln[β (1 + r)] +
ct − 1 =

• Note that Vart (ct+1) = a2σ2 , c2
t , and ln β (1+ r) ≈ r − ρ where
t = (azt + b)2 ≈ a2z 2
ρ ≡ 1/β − 1. Letting 1/γ = θ for the elasticity of intertemporal substitution,
we conclude
2 µ σ

That is, consumption growth (savings) are increasing in the diﬀerence between
the interest rate and the dicount rate and increasing in the income risk relative
to the level of wealth.

2.3 Towards General Equilibrium

• For consumption and wealth to be stationary, namely Et ct+1/ct = 1, we need
2 µ σ
zt ¶2
γ
,
θ(rt − ρ) = −
which requires rt < ρ. Equivalently,
zt = s σ2/γ
2θ(ρ − rt) ≡ Z (rt ).
• Z (r) corresponds to the aggregate supply of savings: It say what is the station-
ary level of wealth for any given interest rate. Note that Z (r) ∈ (0, ∞) and
Z 0 (r) > 0 for all r ∈ [0, ρ), with Z (0) < ∞ and Z (r) → ∞ as r → ρ.
• On the other hand, the optimal level of investment is pinned down by the
equality of the MPK with the interest rate:

rt = f 0 (Kt ).

Equivalently,

kt = (f 0 )−1(rt ) ≡ K (rt).
• K (r) corresponds to the aggregate demand for capital. Note that K (r) ∈ (0, ∞)
and K 0 (r) < 0 for all r ∈ (0, ρ], with K (r) → ∞ as r → 0 and K (ρ) < ∞.

• A steady state corresponds to an intersection of the curves Z (r) and K (r). That
is, the steady-state interest rate and capital stock are given by r∗ and k∗ such
that Z (r∗) = K (r∗) = k∗ .

• By the properties of Z and K, the steady state exists and is unique.
• Moreover, for any σ > 0, the steady state is r∗ < ρ and k∗ > K (ρ). That is, the
interest rate is lower and the capital stock is higher under incomplete markets
than under complete markets.

• Finally, an increase in σ (labor income risk) increases the supply of savings Z (r)
without aﬀecting the demand for investment K (r). Therefore, r∗ is decreasing
in σ , and k∗ is increasing in σ .

• The above analysis is a heuristic representation of the more formal and exact
analysis in Aiyagari (1994).
