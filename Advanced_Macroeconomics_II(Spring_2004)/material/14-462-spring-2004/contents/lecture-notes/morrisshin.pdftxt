1 Framework

Actions, Outcomes and Payoﬀs. There are two possible regimes, the status quo
and an alternative. There is a measure-one continuum of agents, indexed by i ∈ [0, 1].
Each agent can choose between an action that is favorable to the alternative regime
and an action is favorable to the status quo. We call these actions, respectively,
“attack” and “not attack”. All agents move simultaneously.
We denote the regime outcome with R ∈ {0, 1}, where R = 0 represents survival of
the status quo and R = 1 represents collapse. We similarly denote the action of an
agent with ai ∈ {0, 1}, where ai = 0 represents “not attack” and ai = 1 represents
“attack”.
The payoﬀ from not attacking is normalized to zero. The payoﬀ from attacking is
b > 0 if the status quo is abandoned and −c < 0 otherwise. Hence, the utility of
agent i is

ui = ai (bR − c).

1

Finally, the status quo is abandoned (R = 1) if and only if

if A ≥ θ
if A < θ

A ≥ θ ,
where A ≡ R aidi ∈ [0, 1] denotes the mass of agents attacking and θ ∈ R para-
meterizes the exogenous strength of the status quo (or the quality of the economic
fundamentals). Let θ ≡ 0 and θ ≡ 1.
Complementarity. Note that the actions of the agents are strategic complements,
since it pays for an individual to attack if and only if the status quo collapses and, in
turn, the status quo collapses if and only if a suﬃciently large fraction of the agents
attacks. This coordination problem is the heart of the model. To see this more clearly,
rewrite the payoﬀ of agent i as
ui = U (ai , A, θ) = ( ai (b − c)
−aic
Assuming θ is known, the best response is
U (ai , A, θ) = ( 1 if A ≥ θ
g(A, θ) = arg max
0 if A < θ
a∈{0,1}
Note that both U and g are increasing in A, so that we have both a positive externality
and a complementarity. In particular, the complementarity is of the “strong” form
we discussed in the ﬁrst lecture.
Interpretations. This simple model can capture the role of coordination and
multiplicity of equilibria in a variety of interesting applications. For instance, in
models of self-fulﬁlling currency crises (Obstfeld, 1986, 1996; Morris and Shin, 1998),
there is a central bank interested in maintaining a currency peg and a large number
of speculators, with ﬁnite wealth, deciding whether to attack the currency or not. In
this context, a “regime change” occurs when a suﬃciently large mass of speculators
attacks the currency, forcing the central bank to abandon the peg.
In models of self-fulling bank runs, a “regime change” occurs once a suﬃciently large
number of depositors decide to withdraw their deposits, relative to liquid resources

available to the system, forcing the bank to suspend its payments. Similarly, in
models of self-fulﬁlling debt crises (Calvo, 1988; Cole and Kehoe, 1996; Morris and
Shin; 2003), a “regime change” occurs when a lender fails to obtain reﬁnancing by a
suﬃciently large fraction of its creditors.
Finally, Atkeson (2000) interprets the model as describing riots. The potential
rioters may or may not overwhelm the police force in charge of containing social
unrest depending on the number of the rioters and the strength of the police force.
Information. Suppose for a moment that θ were commonly known by all agents.
For θ ≤ θ, the fundamentals are so weak that the regime is doomed with certainty
and the unique equilibrium is every agent attacking. For θ > θ, the fundamentals are
so strong that the regime can survive an attack of any size and the unique equilibrium
is every agent not attacking.
For intermediate values, θ ∈ (θ , θ ], the regime is sound but vulnerable to a suﬃ-
ciently large attack and there are multiple equilibria sustained by self-fulﬁlling ex-
pectations. In one equilibrium, individuals expect everyone else to attack, they then
ﬁnd it individually optimal to attack, the status quo is abandoned and expectations
are vindicated. In another, individuals expect no one else to attack, they then ﬁnd
it individually optimal not to attack, the status quo is spared and expectations are
again fulﬁlled. The interval (θ, θ] thus represents the set of “critical fundamentals”
for which multiple equilibria are possible under common knowledge.
Implicitly, each equilibrium is sustained by diﬀerent self-fulﬁlling expectations about
what other agents do. With common knowledge, in equilibrium individuals can per-
fectly forecast each other actions and coordinate on multiple courses of action. Fol-
lowing Morris and Shin (1998), we assume that θ is never common knowledge and
that individuals instead have private noisy information about θ. Private informa-
tion serves as an anchor for individual’s actions that may avoid the indeterminacy of
expectations about others actions.
Initially agents have a common prior about θ ; for simplicity, we let this prior be

3

(degenerate) uniform over the entire real line. Agent i then observes a private signal

xi = θ + ξ i ,

where the idiosyncratic noise ξ i is N (0, σ2
x) with σx > 0 and is independent of θ. The
signal xi is thus a suﬃcient statistic for the private information of an agent.
Note that because there is a continuum of agents the information contained by
the entire economy, (xi )i∈[0,1] , is enough to infer the fundamental θ. However, this
information is dispersed throughout the population, which is the key feature of the
Morris-Shin framework.
In particular,
Finally, agents may also have access to some public information.
agents observe an exogenous public signal z = θ + v , where v ∼ N (0, σ2
z ). The public
noise v is distributed independently of θ and the private noise ξ .
Equilibrium. An economy is parametrized by the standard deviations (σx , σ z ),
or equivalently the precisions (αx , αz ), where αx = σ−2
x and αz = σ−2
z . A symmetric
Bayesian equilibrium is deﬁned as follows

Deﬁnition 1 An equilibrium is a strategy a(.) and an aggregate attack A(.) such that:

a E [U (a, A(θ, z), θ) | x, z ]
a(x, z ) ∈ arg max
A(θ, z ) = Z a(x, z )√αxφ (√αx [x − θ ]) dx.
2 Monotone Equilibria

We start by considering monotone or threshold equilibria, that is, equilibria in which
a(x, z ) is monotonic in x.
In a monotone equilibrium, for any realization of z , there is a threshold x∗(z ) such
that an agent attacks if and only if x ≤ x∗ (z ). By implication, the aggregate size
of the attack is decreasing in θ, so that there is also a threshold θ∗ (z ) such that the
status quo is abandoned if and only if θ ≤ θ∗ (z). A monotone equilibrium is identiﬁed
4

by x∗ and θ∗ . In step 1, below, we characterize the equilibrium θ∗ for given x∗ . In
step 2, we characterize the equilibrium x∗ for given θ∗ . In step 3, we characterize both
conditions and examine equilibrium existence and uniqueness.
Step 1. For given realizations of θ and z , the aggregate size of the attack is given
by the mass of agents who receive signals x ≤ x∗(z ). That is,
A(θ, z ) = Φ (√αx (x∗(z ) − θ)) ,
where αx = σ−2
x is the precision of private information. Note that A(θ , z ) is decreasing
in θ , so that regime change occurs if and only if θ ≤ θ∗(z ), where θ∗(z ) is the unique
solution to

A(θ∗(z ), z ) = θ∗ (z ).

Rearranging we obtain:

1
√αx
Step 2. Given that regime change occurs if and only if θ ≤ θ∗ (z), the payoﬀ of an
agent is

x∗(z ) = θ∗ (z ) +

Φ−1 (θ∗(z )).

(1)

E [ U (a, A(θ, z ), θ) | x, z ] = a(b Pr [θ ≤ θ∗ (z ) | x, z ] − c).
Let αx = σ−2
x and αz = σ−2
z denote, respectively, the precision of private and public
information. The posterior of the agent is
θ | x, z ∼ N ¡ δx + (1 − δ)z , α−1 ¢ ,
where δ ≡ αx/(αx +αz ) is the relative precision of private information and α ≡ αx +αz
is the overall precision of information. Hence, the posterior probability of regime
change is

Pr [ θ ≤ θ∗(z ) | x, z ] = 1 − Φ ¡√α(δx + (1 − δ)z − θ∗(z ))¢ ,
which is monotonic in x. It follows that the agent attacks if and only if x ≤ x∗(z ),
where x∗ (z) solves the indiﬀerence condition
b Pr [ θ ≤ θ∗ (z ) | x∗ (z), z ] = c.
5

Substituting the expression for the posterior and the deﬁnition of δ and α, we obtain:
Φ µ√αx + αz µ αx
z − θ∗(z )¶¶ =
αx + αz
Step 3. Combining (1) and (2), we conclude that θ∗(z ) can be sustained in equi-
librium if and only if it solves

where g = p1 + αz /αxΦ−1 (1 − c/b) and

G(θ, z) ≡
With θ∗(z ) given by (3), x∗ (z) is then given by (1). We are now in a position to
establish existence and determinacy of the equilibrium by considering the properties
of the function G. Note that, for every z ∈ R, G(θ, z) is continuous in θ, with
G(θ, z ) = −∞ and G(θ, z ) = ∞, which implies that there necessarily exists a solution
and any solution satisﬁes θ∗(z ) ∈ (θ, θ). This establishes existence; we now turn to
uniqueness. Note that

φ(Φ−1 (θ)) −
∂ θ
Since maxw∈R φ(w) = 1/√2π then if αz /√αx ≤ √2π we have that G is strictly
increasing in θ, which implies a unique solution to (3). If instead αz /√αx > √2π ,
then G is non-monotonic in θ and there is an interval (z , z ) such that (1) admits
multiple solutions θ∗(z ) whenever z ∈ (z , z ) and a unique solution otherwise. We
conclude that monotone equilibrium is unique if and only if αz /√αx ≤ √2π .
We summarize these results in the following proposition.

Proposition 2 (Morris-Shin) Let σx and σ z denote the standard deviations of the
private and the public noise, respectively. There always exists a monotone equilibrium
z ≤ √2π .
and it is unique if and only if σx/σ 2
6

Finally, consider the limits as σx → 0 for given σ z , or σ z → ∞ for given σx . In
either case, αz /√αx → 0 and p(αx + αz ) /αx → 1. Condition (3) then implies that
θ∗ (z) → bθ = 1 − c/b, for all z . This proves the following result, which we refer to as
the Morris-Shin limit result :
Proposition 3 (Morris-Shin limit) In the limit as either σx → 0 for given σ z , or
σ z → ∞ for given σx , there is a unique monotone equilibrium in which the regime
changes if and only if θ ≤ bθ, where bθ = 1 − c/b ∈ (θ, θ).
3 Iterated Dominance Argument

The results above established that there exists a unique monotone equilibrium when-
ever the noise in private information is small enough. These results, however, left
open the possibility that there are other non-monotone equilibria. We now prove the
much stronger result that there is no other equilibrium and, what is more, that the
equilibrium is dominance solvable.
To simplify the exposition, consider the case that there is no public information:
σ z = ∞ (αz = 0), implying δ = 1 and α = αx . We can thus drop z and denote the
strategy by a(x) and the aggregate attack by A(θ).
For any bx ∈ [−∞, +∞], let Abx (θ) denote the size of aggregate attack when (almost
every) agent attacks if and only if x ≤ bx.Next, deﬁne the function
V (x, bx) = E [ U (1, Abx (θ), θ) − U (0, Abx (θ), θ) | x ] .
This is the utility diﬀerence between attacking and not attacking for an agent who
has private information x and expects the other agents to attack if and only if their
signals fall below bx. In our model,
Abx (θ) = Φ (√αx [bx − θ])
and
V (x, bx) = b − bΦ ³√αx [x − bθ]´ − c,
7

where bθ = bθ (bx) is the unique solution to Abx (bθ) = bθ, or equivalently the inverse of
1
Φ−1(bθ).
bx = bθ +
√αx
Note bθ is increasing in bx. It follows that V (x, bx) is increasing in bx : The more aggres-
sive the other agents are, the higher the expected payoﬀ from attacking. Moreover,
V (x, bx) is decreasing in x : The higher the private signal, the lower the expected
payoﬀ from attacking.
Next, note that V (x, bx) is continuous in x and satisﬁes V (x, bx) → b − c > 0 as
x → −∞ and V (x, bx) → −c < 0 as x → +∞. We can thus deﬁne a function h
such that x = h(bx) is the unique solution to V (x, bx) = 0 with respect to x. The
interpretation of h(bx) is simple: When agents j 6= i attack if and only if xj ≤ bx, agent
i ﬁnds it optimal to attack if and only if xi ≤ h(bx). Because V (x, bx) is continuous in
both arguments, decreasing in x, and increasing in bx, the function h(bx) is continuous
and increasing in bx. Finally, note that h has a unique ﬁxed point x∗ = h(x∗) and this
ﬁxed point is indeed the threshold of the unique monotone equilibrium we constructed
in the previous section.
Construct a sequence {xk }∞k=0 by x0 = −∞ and xk = h(xk−1) for all k ≥ 1. In
particular, letting θk−1 be the solution to

Hence, x0 = −∞, θ0 = 0, x1 = 1√αx
{xk }∞k=0 is increasing and bounded above by x∗ . Hence, the sequence {xk }∞k=0 converges
to some x. By continuity of h, the limit x must be a ﬁxed point of h. But we already
proved that h has a unique ﬁxed point. Hence, x = x∗ .

and thus

we have

8

Next, construct a sequence {xk }∞k=0 by x0 = −∞ and xk = h(xk−1) for all k ≥ 1.
Note that this sequence is decreasing and bounded below by x∗ . Hence, the sequence
{xk }∞k=0 converges to some x. By continuity of h, the limit x must be a ﬁxed point of
h. But we already proved that h has a unique ﬁxed point. Hence, x = x∗ .
But, what is the meaning of the sequences we constructed? Consider x1 . If nobody
else attacks, the agent ﬁnds it optimal to attack if and only if x ≤ x1 . By complemen-
tarity, if some people attack, the agent ﬁnds it optimal to attack at least for x ≤ x1 .
That is, for x ≤ x1 , attacking is dominant. Next, consider x2 . When other agents
attack if and only if it is dominant for them to do so, that is, if and only if x ≤ x1 ,
then it is optimal to attack if and only if x ≤ x2 . By complementarity, if other agents
attack at least for x ≤ x1 , then it is optimal to attack at least for x ≤ x2 . That is, for
x ≤ x2 , attacking becomes dominant after the ﬁrst round of deletion of dominated
strategies. Similarly, for x ≤ xk−1 , attacking becomes dominant after the k − 1 round
of deletion of dominated strategies. Hence, {xk }∞k=0 represents iterated deletion of
dominated strategies “from below”. Similarly, {xk }∞k=0 represents iterated deletion of
dominated strategies “from above”.
To recap, the only strategies that have survived k rounds of iterated deletion of
dominated strategies are functions a such that a(x) = 1 for all x ≤ xk and a(x) = 0
for x > xk ; for x ∈ (xk , xk ), the value of a(x) is still “free” at the k-th round. But we
proved that both xk and xk converge to x∗ as k → ∞. Hence, in the limit, the only
strategy that survives is the function a such that a(x) = 1 for x ≤ x∗ and a(x) = 0
for x > x∗ , which is precisely the strategy in the monotone equilibrium.
As long as αz /√αx ≤ √2π , the above result extends to the presence of public
information. (Do it as an exercise.) We conclude:
z ≤ √2π , there is a unique equilibrium. This equilibrium is
Proposition 4 If σx/σ2
the monotone equilibrium described before and it is solvable by iterated deletion of
dominated strategies.
When instead αz /√αx > √2π , the argument breaks in the following respect. For

some realizations of the public signal, the equation V (x, x) = 0 has three solutions
(equivalently, h has three ﬁxed points); this is what we showed in the previous section.
The sequences {xk }∞k=0 and {xk }∞k=0 are still well deﬁned as above. But now their
Instead, x is the lowest of the three solutions to
limits x and x do not coincide.
V (x, x) = 0 and x is the highest of the three. Hence, the two monotone equilibria
that we constructed in the previous section represent the least and most aggressive
equilibria of the game. It is unclear whether there are also other intermediate, non-
monotone equilibria.
