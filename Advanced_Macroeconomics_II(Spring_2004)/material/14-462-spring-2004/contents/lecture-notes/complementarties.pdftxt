1 Motivation

Why care?
A large number of economic interactions are characterized by strategic complemen-
tarities, can be modeled as coordination games, and often exhibit multiple equilibria
sustained by self-fulﬁlling expectations. Prominent examples of coordination games
in macroeconomics include:

• self-fulﬁlling bank runs (Diamond and Dybvig, 1983)
• currency crises (Obstfeld, 1986, 1996; Velasco, 1996)
• debt crises (Calvo, 1988; Cole and Kehoe, 1996)
• ﬁnancial crashes (Freixas and Rochet, 1997; Chari and Kehoe, 2003a,b)
• regime switches (Cooper and John, 1988; Chamley, 1999).
Strategic complementarities also arise in the following contexts:

1

• business cycles with production externalities or other complementarities (Bryant,
1983; Baxter and King, 1991; Benhabib and Farmer, 1994; Cooper and Johri,
1997; Shleifer, 1986)

• endogenous growth with spillovers (Romer, 1986; Lucas, 1988)
• network externalities, technology adoption (Katz and Shapiro, 1985, 1986; Farell
and Saloner, 1985)

• imperfect market competition (Milgrom and Roberts, 1990; Vives 1999; Kiy-
otaki, 1988)

• thick-market externalities (Diamond, 1982; Murphy, Shleifer and Vishny, 1989),
• restricted market participation (Azariadis, 1981)
• incomplete ﬁnancial markets (Bernanke and Gertler, 1989; Kiyotaki and Moore,
1997; Angeletos, 2003).

• lobbying, political reforms, revolutions, riots, and social change (Kuran, 1987;
Atkeson, 2000; Battaglini and Benabou, 2003).

And so? What do complementarities deliver?

• ampliﬁcation
• persistence
• commovement
• synchronization
• multiplicity
• animal spirits

2 Framework

We consider a simple canonical model of investment complementarity. The economy
is populated by a continuum of measure one of agents, indexed by i and uniformly
distributed over the [0, 1] interval. Each agent engages in some economic activity
(investment). Like in Bryant (1983), Cooper and John (1988), Acemoglu (1993), etc.,
the individual return to investment is increasing in the aggregate level of investment,
thus introducing strategic complementarity in agents’ investment choices.
Payoﬀ. The payoﬀ for agent i is given by

(1)
ui = U (ki , K, θ) = A(K, θ)ki − c(ki ),
where ki ∈ K ⊆ R is the action of agent i, K = R kidi is the corresponding aggregate,
θ ∈ R is an exogenous random variable, A : K ×R → R and c : K→ R. We interpret ki
as investment (or eﬀort, or other economic activity), A as the gross return to invest-
ment, c as the cost of investment, and θ as exogenous productivity (the underlying
economic fundamentals). It is then natural to assume that A is increasing in θ and c
is increasing in ki . We ﬁnally introduce an investment complementarity by assuming
that A is increasing in K.1
Best Response. We are interested in the case that agents have heterogeneous
information about θ. For a moment, however, suppose θ is common knowledge. The
best response of agent i is then given by2

ki = g(K, θ) ≡ arg max
k∈K
It follows that, if A increases with K, so does g . Hence, complementarity means
that the optimal investment for agent i increases with the aggregate investment in

U (ki , K, θ).

(2)

1 Provided diﬀerentiability, this is equivalent to imposing UkK > 0.
2 For expositional simplicity, it is useful to assume that c is strictly convext, so that the best
response is a continuous function. But similar arguments can be made when the best response is a
correspondance.

the economy, or equivalently that the best response function is positively sloped.
Without serious loss of generality, we can let c(k) = k2/2, in which case

ki = g(K, θ) = A(k , θ).

g thus inherits exactly the properties of A.
Equilibrium. A symmetric equilibrium is an equilibrium where all agents choose
the same action. The set of symmetric equilibrium thus coincides with the set of ﬁxed
of g . That is, in a symmetric equilibrium, aggregate investment solves

K = g(K, θ).

Complementarity and Multiplicity. The steepness of the best response repre-
sents the strength of the complementarity. Two possibilities then arise. Either the
slope of the best response function is always less than one, in which case the equilib-
rium is unique; or the slope is higher than one over some range, in which case multiple
equilibria are possible. It is in this sense that we draw a distinction between weak and
strong complementarity. The two cases are illustrated in Figure 1. The case of weak
complementarity corresponds to the black solid curve, which interests only once with
the 45-degree line; point A then gives the unique equilibrium of the economy. The
case of strong complementarity corresponds to the grey solid curve, which intersects
three times with the 45-degree line; points B and C then give the two stable equilibria
of the economy, whereas point A now represents an unstable equilibrium.
Ideally, one would like to allow for a general speciﬁcation of investment complemen-
tarities as described above. However, when agents have heterogeneous information
about θ, such level of generality makes the model totally intractable. For that reason,
in the lectures to follow, we restrict attention to two special speciﬁcations which turn
out to be tractable. The one speciﬁcation leads to a linear best response like the black
dashed line in Figure 1 and is meant to capture the case of weak complementarity
(unique equilibrium). The other speciﬁcation leads to a best response like the grey
dashed line in Figure 1 and is meant to capture the case of strong complementarity

(multiple equilibria). For the time being, however, we continue discussing some of
the generic properties of models with complementarities.
Pareto Ranking. In this framework, multiple equilibria can be Pareto ranked.
In particular, consider two equilibria, the ﬁrst associated with aggregate investment
K = K1 and the second with K = K2 > K1 ; the second equilibrium Pareto dominates
the ﬁrst. This ranking is because the complementarity is associated with a positive
externality. Indeed, in this framework, UkK > 0 if and only if UK > 0. See Cooper
and John (1988) for more discussion.
Ampliﬁcation. Let K solve K = g(K, θ) and suppose gK 6= 0. Then, by the IFT,
K is (locally) a function of θ, that is, K = K (θ). Moreover,

1 − gK
Suppose gθ > 0, so that we can interpret higher θ with higher productivity. In any
stable equilibrium, gK < 1, and because of the complementarity, gK > 0. Hence,
dθ > gθ , whereas in the absence of complementarities dK
dθ = gθ . The quantity

represents a (local) multiplier eﬀect.
Persistence. Suppose there are many periods and At = A(Kt , Kt−1 , θ t ), with all
derivatives of A positive. In equilibrium,

Kt = g(Kt , Kt−1 , θ t ),

so that

Kt = K (Kt−1 , θ t ),
Hence, a dynamic complementarity can give rise to endogenous persistence.
Commovement. Suppose productivity is idiosyncratic, so that

ki = g(K, θ i ),

where θ i is distributed with density f (θ). An equilibrium is now a rule k(θ) such that
k(θ) = g µZ k(z )f (z)dz , θ¶ .
In the absence of complementarity, k(θ i ) = g(θ i ) so that the investment of i depends
only his own productivity. If instead there are complementarities, the investment of
i depends also on the productivities of other agents. In particular, if θ increases for
a (non-zero-measure) subset of the agents, investment will increase for all agents.
Synchronization. If agents take discrete choices (lumpy investment, attack a peg,
etc.) and there are complementarities, then there is a incentive to synchronize actions.
