A large number of private agents play against a government.
The government solves

sub ject to the Philips curve

min L = ©(y − y∗ )2 + β π 2ª

y = y + α(π − π e ) − ε.
The shock ε is distributed uniform over [−e, +e]
The agents solve

min E (π e − π)2
The agents move ﬁrst, setting π e without observing ε. Nature then draws ε. The
government moves last, setting π after observing ε and taking π e as given.

The best response of the government is given by
α (y∗ − y + ε) + α2π e
α2 + β

π = g(π e , ε) =

.

Note that g(0, 0) > 0 and gπ (π , ε) = α2
α2+β ∈ (0, 1). The best response for the agents
is

Hence, in equilibrium,

π e = Eπ

π e = Eg(π e , ε) =

α (y∗ − y) + α2π e
≡ G(π e ).
α2 + β
By the properties of g , we have G(0) and G0 ∈ (0, 1). Hence, there is a unique ﬁxed
point with π e > 0. Indeed, this is given by
α (y∗ − y)
β

π e =

It follows that equilibrium inﬂation is

We now reinterpret π as the rate of devaluation. We also modify the preferences of
the government so that the government solves
min L = ©(y − y∗)2 + βπ 2 + θRª
sub ject to the Philips curve, where R is an indicator that takes the value 1 if π 6= 0
and 0 if π = 0. The variable θ represents the value of maintaining the peg.

The timing is the same. The government chooses π after observing ε and after
agents have set π e .
If the government sets π = g(π e , ε), then welfare losses are given by
β
(y∗ − y + ε + απ e )2 + θ.
α2 + β
If instead the government sets π = 0, then welfare losses are given by
L = Lf ixed(π e , ε) = (y∗ − y + ε + απ e)2
Deﬁne ε = ε (π e ) and ε = ε (π e ) as the lowest and highest solution to

L = Lf lex (π e , ε) =

Lf lex (πe , ε) = Lf ixed(π e , ε).
Whenever ε ∈ [ε, ε], the government ﬁnds it optimal to set π = 0 (ﬁxed). Whenever
ε /∈ [ε, ε], the government prefers to set π = g(π e ) (ﬂexibility).
Now consider the equilibrium. In equilibrium,

π e = Eπ = 0 · Pr (ε ∈ [ε, ε]) + Eg(π e , ε) · Pr (ε /∈ [ε, ε]) ≡ G(π e )
Note that as π e increases, the interval [ε, ε] shifts down. It can be shown that G(0) >
0, G0 > 0 and, over some range, G0 > 1. Hence, G may possibly have either a unique
of multiple ﬁxed points, depending on the value of θ.
The graph of G is illustrated in Figure 1. For θ either small enough or large enough,
the unique equilibrium is unique. But for intermediate value of θ, there are multiple
equilibria. In particular, for intermediate θ, there are three equilibria, represented by
points A, B , and C in the ﬁgure. In point C, the peg is always abandoned. In point
A, the peg is abandoned only for very extreme shocks. The equilibrium in C thus
represents an “expectations trap”. On the other hand, only the “bad” equilibrium
(C ) survives for θ small enough, whereas only the “good” equilibrium (A0 ) survives
for θ high enough.
