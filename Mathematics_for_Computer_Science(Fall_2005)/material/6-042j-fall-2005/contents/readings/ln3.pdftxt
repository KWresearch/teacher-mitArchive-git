Induction 

1  Induction 

A professor brings to class a bottomless bag of assorted miniature candy bars.  She offers to share 
in accordance with two rules. First, she numbers the students 0, 1, 2, 3, and so forth for convenient 
reference. Now here are the two rules: 

1.  Student 0 gets candy. 
2.  For all n  ∈ N, if student n  gets candy, then student n   +  1  also gets candy. 

You can think of the second rule as a compact way of writing a whole sequence of statements, one 
for each natural value of n: 

•  If student 0 gets candy, then student 1 also gets candy. 

•  If student 1 gets candy, then student 2 also gets candy. 

•  If student 2 gets candy, then student 3 also gets candy, and so forth. 

Now suppose you are student 17.  By these rules, are you entitled to a miniature candy bar? Well, 
student  0  gets  candy  by  the  ﬁrst  rule.  Therefore,  by  the  second  rule,  student  1  also  gets  candy, 
which means  student  2  gets  candy  as well, which means  student  3  get  candy,  and  so  on.  So  the 
professor ’s  two  rules  actually  guarantee  candy  for  every  student,  no matter  how  large  the  class. 
You win! 
This reasoning generalizes to a principle called induction: 

Principle of Induction. Let P (n) be a predicate.  If 

•  P (0)  is true, and 
•  for all n  ∈ N, P (n) implies P (n  +  1), 

then P (n) is true for all n  ∈ N.

Course Notes, Week 3:  Induction 

Here’s the correspondence between the induction principle and sharing candy bars.  Suppose that 
P (n) is  the  predicate,  “student  n  gets  candy”.  Then  the  professor ’s  ﬁrst  rule  asserts  that  P (0) 
is  true,  and  her  second  rule  is  that  for  all  n  ∈  N,  P (n) implies  P (n  + 1).  Given  these  facts,  the 
induction principle says that P (n) is true for all n  ∈ N.  In other words, everyone gets candy. 
The intuitive justiﬁcation for the general induction principle is the same as for everyone getting a 
candy bar under the professor ’s two rules.  So the Principle of Induction is universally accepted as 
an obvious, sound proof method. What’s not so obvious is how much mileage we get by using it. 

2  Using Induction 

Induction is by far the most powerful and commonly­used proof technique in Discrete Mathemat­
ics and Computer Science.  In fact,  the use of induction is a deﬁning characteristic of discrete —as 
opposed to continuous —Mathematics. 
Induction  often works directly  in proving  that  some  statement  about  natural  numbers  holds  for 
all of them.  For example, here is a classic formula: 
Theorem 2.1.  For all n   ∈ �, 

1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n  =	

n(n   + 1) 
2 

(1)

The left side of equation (1) represents the sum of all the numbers from 1 to n. You’re supposed to 
guess the pattern and mentally replace the dots (· · · ) with the other terms. We could eliminate the 
� 
�	
� 
need for guessing by rewriting the left side with summation notation: 
n
i 
i 
1≤i≤n
i∈{1,...,n} 
i=1  

or 

or 

i 

Each of these expressions denotes the sum of all values taken on by the expression to the right of 
the sigma as the variable, i, ranges from 1 to n.  The meaning of the sum in Theorem 2.1 is not so 
obvious in a couple of special cases: 

•	 If n  =  1, then there is only one term in the summation, and so 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n  =  1. Don’t 
be misled by the appearance of 2 and 3 and the suggestion that 1 and n  are distinct terms! 
•	 If n  ≤ 0, then there are no terms at all in the summation, and so 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n  =  0. 

The dots notation  is  convenient,  but watch out  for  these  special  cases where  the notation  is mis­
leading! 
Now  let’s  use  the  induction  principle  to  prove  Theorem  2.1.  Suppose  that  we  deﬁne  predicate 
P (n) to be “1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n  =  n(n  + 1)/2”. Recast in terms of this predicate, the theorem claims 
that P (n) is true for all n  ∈ N. This is great, because the induction principle lets us reach precisely 
that conclusion, provided we establish two simpler facts: 

•	 P (0) is true. 

Course Notes, Week 3:  Induction	
•	 For all n  ∈ N, P (n) implies P (n  + 1). 

3 

So now our  job is reduced to proving these two statements.  The ﬁrst is true because P (0) asserts 
that a sum of zero terms is equal to 0(0 + 1)/2 = 0. 
The second statement is more complicated.  But remember the basic plan for proving the validity 
of any  implication:  assume  the statement on  the  left and  then prove  the statement on  the right.  In 
this case, we assume P (n): 

1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n  = 

n(n   + 1) 
2 

in order to prove P (n  + 1): 

n  + 1)(n  + 2) 
(
2 
These two equations are quite similar; in fact, adding (n + 1) to both sides of the ﬁrst equation and 
simplifying the right side gives the second equation: 

1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n  + (n  + 1) =

1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + n  + (n  + 1) = 

n(n   + 1) 
+ (n   + 1) 
2 
(n  + 2)(n  + 1) 
2 
Thus,  if P (n) is  true,  then  so  is P (n  + 1).  This argument  is valid  for  every natural number n,  so 
this  establishes  the  second  fact  required  by  the  induction  principle.  In  effect,  we’ve  just  proved 
that P (0) implies P (1), P (1) implies P (2), P (2) implies P (3), etc.  all in one fell swoop. 
With  these  two  facts  in  hand,  the  induction  principle  says  that  the  predicate  P (n) is  true  for  all 
natural n. And so the theorem is proved!

2.1  A Template for Induction Proofs 

The proof  of Theorem  2.1 was  relatively  simple,  but  even  the most  complicated  induction proof 
follows exactly the same template. There are ﬁve components: 

1.	 State  that  the proof uses  induction.  This  immediately conveys  the overall structure of  the 
proof, which helps the reader understand your argument. 

2.	 Deﬁne an appropriate predicate P (n).  The eventual conclusion of the induction argument 
will  be  that  P (n) is  true  for  all  natural  n.  Thus,  you  should  deﬁne  the  predicate  P (n) so 
that your theorem is equivalent to (or follows from) this conclusion. Often the predicate can 
be  lifted  straight  from  the  claim,  as  in  the  example above.  The predicate P (n) is  called  the 
“induction hypothesis”.  Sometimes the induction hypothesis will involve several variables, 
in which case you should indicate which variable serves as n. 

3.	 Prove that P (0) is true.  This is usually easy, as in the example above.  This part of the proof 
is called the “base case” or “basis step”.  (Sometimes the base case will be n  =  1 or even some 
larger number, in which case the starting value of n   also should be stated.) 

4	

Course Notes, Week 3:  Induction 

4. 	 Prove that P (n) implies P (n  +  1)  for every natural number n.  This is called the “inductive 
step” or “induction step”.  The basic plan  is always  the same:  assume  that P (n) is  true and 
then  use  this  assumption  to  prove  that  P (n  +  1)  is  true.  These  two  statements  should  be 
fairly  similar,  but  bridging  the  gap may  require  some  ingenuity.  Whatever  argument  you 
give must  be  valid  for  every  natural  number  n,  since  the  goal  is  to  prove  the  implications 
P (0)   → P (1), P (1)  → P (2), P (2)  → P (3), etc.  all at once. 
5. 	 Invoke  induction.  Given  these  facts,  the  induction  principle  allows  you  to  conclude  that 
P (n) is  true for all natural n.  This  is  the  logical capstone  to  the whole argument, but many 
writers leave this step implicit. 

Explicitly labeling the base case and inductive step may make your proofs more clear. 

2.2  A Clean Writeup 

The proof of Theorem 2.1 given above  is perfectly valid;  however,  it contains a  lot of extraneous 
explanation  that you won’t usually see  in  induction proofs.  The writeup below  is closer  to what 
you might see in print and should be prepared to produce yourself. 

Proof.  We use induction. The induction hypothesis, P (n), will be equation (1). 
Base case: P (0)  is true, because both sides of equation (1) equal zero when n  = 0. 
Inductive step: Assume that P (n) is true, where n   is any natural number. Then 

1 +  2 +  3 + 

· · ·

+  n  +  (n  +  1) = 

=	

n(n   +  1) 
+  (n  +  1) 
2

(n  +  1)(n  +  2)

2 

by induction hypothesis 

by simple algebra 

which proves P (n  +  1). 
So it follows by induction that P (n) is true for all natural n. 

Induction  was  helpful  for  proving  the  correctness  of  this  summation  formula,  but  not  helpful  for 
discovering  the  formula  in  the ﬁrst place.  There are  some  tricks  for ﬁnding  such  formulas, which 
we’ll show you in a few weeks. 

2.3  A Fibonacci Identity 

For another simple example of the use of induction, we’ll consider the Fibonacci numbers1 . 

1Fibonacci was a thirteenth century mathematician who came up with his numbers in modelling growth of a rabbit 
population.  A simple model for rabbit population growth assumes that at the age of one month, a pair of rabbits will 
give birth to another pair of rabbits, and will continue producing a pair of rabbits every month after that. We let Fn  be 
the total number of rabbit pairs at the start of the nth month, and Bn  be the number of breeding pairs, that is, pairs that 
are  at  least  one month  old.  Now  the pairs  at  the nth month  are  the Fn−1  pairs we  had  the previous month,  plus  the 
Bn−1  newborn pairs produced by the previous month’s breeding pairs, so Fn  =  Fn−1  + Bn−1 . Also, the set of breeding 
pairs at the nth month is simply the set of all the pairs we had the previous month, so Bn  =  Fn−1 .  Replacing Bn−1  by 
Fn−2  yield (2). 

Course Notes, Week 3:  Induction

The ﬁrst  two Fibonacci numbers  are  0  and  1,  and  each  subsequent  Fibonacci number  is  the  sum 
of the two previous ones.  The nth Fibonacci number is denoted Fn .  In other words, the Fibonacci 
numbers are deﬁned recursively by the rules 

F0 
F1 
Fi 

::=  0,  
::=  1,  
::=  Fi−1  +  Fi−2 ,  for i ≥ 2.  

(2) 

The ﬁrst few Fibonacci numbers are 

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, . . . . 

Fibonacci numbers come up naturally in several ways, but they have captivated a continued math­
ematical following out of proportion to their importance in applications because they have a rich 
and  surprising collection of properties,  such as  the one expressed  in  the  following  theorem.  The 
theorem  is  a  good  thing  to  forget  if  you  run  low  on  brain  space,  its  proof  just  provides  a  nice 
illustration of induction. 
Theorem 2.2.  ∀n ≥ 0.  F 2  +  F 2  +
0

+  Fn 
2  =  FnFn+1 .

· · ·

·
For example, for n = 4  we have 02  +  12  +  12  +  22  +  32  = 15  = 3 5.
Let’s  look  for  a proof by  induction.  First,  the  theorem  statement  suggests  that  the  induction hy­

pothesis P (n) be 
n
F 2  =  FnFn+1 .

i=0 
Second, we want  to  identify  the  gap  between P (n) and P (n +  1).  The predicate P (n +  1)  states 
� 
that 
n+1
2  =  Fn+1Fn+2 . 
Fi 
i=0 
Now  the  plan  is  to  use  P (n) to  reduce  this  statement  to  a  simpler  assertion.  An  easy way  is  to 
subtract the equation (3) from (4). This gives: 
+1  =  Fn+1Fn+2  − FnFn+1 .

Fn

(4) 

This is the Fibonacci recurrence in disguise; dividing both sides of (5) by Fn+1  and moving a term 
gives Fn  +  Fn+1  =  Fn+2 .  This is the extra fact need to bridge the gap between P (n) and P (n +  1) 
in the inductive step. The full proof is written below. 

Proof.  The proof is by induction. Let P (n) be the equation (3). 
Base case: P (0)  is true because

Inductive  step:  We  assume  equation  (3)  holds  for  some  n  ≥  0,  and  prove  that  � n+1  F 2  =

Course Notes, Week 3:  Induction

For  all n  ≥  0,  the  equation Fn  + Fn+1  =  Fn+2  holds by  the deﬁnition of  the Fibonacci numbers. 
Multiplying both sides by Fn+1  and rearranging terms gives F 2  = Fn+1Fn+2  − FnFn+1 . Adding 
n+1 
this identity to equation (3) gives:

as required. 
So by induction, we conclude that equation (3) holds for all n  ∈ N. 

2.4  Courtyard Tiling 

Induction served purely as a proof technique in the preceding examples. But induction sometimes 
can serve as a more general reasoning tool. 

MIT recently constructed a new computer science building.  As  the project went  further and  fur­
ther over budget,  there were some radical fundraising ideas.  One plan was to install a big court­
yard with dimensions 2 × 2
n :
n

n2

n2

One of the central squares would be occupied by a statue of a wealthy potential donor.  Let’s call 
him  “Bill”.  (In  the  special  case  n  = 0,  the  whole  courtyard  consists  of  a  single  central  square; 
otherwise, there are four central squares.) A complication was that the building’s unconventional 
architect, Frank Gehry, insisted that only special L­shaped tiles be used: 

A courtyard meeting these constraints exists, at least for n   = 2:


Course Notes, Week 3:  Induction


7 

B


For larger values of n, is there a way to tile a 2n  × 2n  courtyard with L­shaped tiles and a statue in 
the center? Let’s try to prove that this is so. 
Theorem 2.3.  For all n  ≥ 0  there exists a tiling of a 2n  × 2n  courtyard with Bill in a central square. 

Proof.  (doomed  attempt) The proof  is by  induction.  Let P (n) be  the proposition  that  there  exists  a 
tiling of a 2n  × 2n  courtyard with Bill in the center. 
Base case: P (0)  is true because Bill ﬁlls the whole courtyard. 
Inductive step: Assume that there is a tiling of a 2n  × 2n  courtyard with Bill in the center for some 
n  ≥  0.  We must  prove  that  there  is  a way  to  tile  a  2n+1  × 2n+1  courtyard with  Bill  in  the  center 
. . . . 

Now we’re in trouble! The ability to tile a smaller courtyard with Bill in the center isn’t much help 
in  tiling a  larger courtyard with Bill  in  the center.  We haven’t ﬁgured out how  to bridge  the gap 
between P (n) and P (n  +  1). 

So  if we’re  going  to  prove  Theorem  2.3  by  induction,  we’re  going  to  need  some  other  induction 
hypothesis than simply the statement about n   that we’re trying to prove. 

When this happens, your ﬁrst fallback should be to look for a stronger induction hypothesis; that is, 
one which  implies your previous hypothesis.  For example, we could make P (n) the proposition 
that for every location of Bill in a 2n  × 2n  courtyard, there exists a tiling of the remainder. 
This  advice  may  sound  bizzare:  “If  you  can’t  prove  something,  try  to  prove  something  more 
grand!”  But for induction arguments, this makes sense.  In the inductive step, where you have to 
prove  P (n)  −→  P (n  +  1),  you’re  in  better  shape  because  you  can  assume  P (n),  which  is  now  a 
more general, more useful statement. Let’s see how this plays out in the case of courtyard tiling. 

Proof.  (successful  attempt)  The  proof  is  by  induction.  Let  P (n)  be  the  proposition  that  for  every 
location of Bill in a 2n  × 2n  courtyard, there exists a tiling of the remainder. 
Base case: P (0)  is true because Bill ﬁlls the whole courtyard. 
Inductive  step:  Asume  that  P (n)  is  true  for  some  n  ≥  0;  that  is,  for  every  location  of  Bill  in  a 
2n  × 2n  courtyard, there exists a tiling of the remainder. Divide the 2n+1  × 2n+1  courtyard into four 
quadrants, each 2n  × 2n .  One quadrant contains Bill (B in the diagram below).  Place a temporary 
Bill (X in the diagram) in each of the three central squares lying outside this quadrant: 

8

2n 

Now  we  can  tile  each  of  the  four  quadrants  by  the  induction  assumption.  Replacing  the  three 
temporary Bills with a single L­shaped tile completes the job. This proves that P (n) implies P (n + 
1)  for all n  ≥ 0. The theorem follows as a special case. 

This  proof  has  two  nice  properties.  First,  not  only  does  the  argument  guarantee  that  a  tiling 
exists, but also it gives a recursive procedure for ﬁnding such a tiling.  Second, we have a stronger 
result:  if  Bill  wanted  a  statue  on  the  edge  of  the  courtyard,  away  from  the  pigeons,  we  could 
accommodate him! 
Strengthening  the  induction hypothesis  is often a good move when an  induction proof won’t go 
through.  But keep in mind that the stronger assertion must actually be true; otherwise, there isn’t 
much hope of  constructing  a valid proof!  Sometimes ﬁnding  just  the  right  induction hypothesis 
requires trial, error, and insight. For example, mathematicians spent almost twenty years trying to 
prove or disprove the conjecture that “Every planar graph is 5­choosable”2 . Then, in 1994, Carsten 
Thomassen gave an induction proof simple enough to explain on a napkin. The key turned out to 
be ﬁnding an extremely clever induction hypothesis; with that in hand, completing the argument 
is easy! 

2.5  A Faulty Induction Proof 

False Theorem.  All horses are the same color. 

Notice  that no n  is mentioned  in  this assertion, so we’re going  to have  to reformulate  it  in a way 
that makes an n  explicit.  In particular, we’ll (falsely) prove that 
False Theorem 2.4.  In every set of n  ≥ 1  horses, all are the same color. 

This  a  statement  about  all  integers  n  ≥  1  rather  ≥  0,  so  it’s  natural  to  use  a  slight  variation  on 
induction:  prove P (1)  in the base case and then prove that P (n) implies P (n  +  1)  for all n  ≥  1  in 
the  inductive  step.  This  is  a perfectly valid variant  of  induction  and  is  not  the problem with  the 
proof below. 

2 5­choosability is a slight generalization of 5­colorability.  Although every planar graph is 4­colorable and therefore 
5­colorable, not every planar graph  is 4­choosable.  If  this all sounds  like nonsense, don’t panic.  We’ll discuss graphs, 
planarity, and coloring in two weeks. 

Course Notes, Week 3:  Induction 

Proof.  The proof is by induction. The induction hypothesis, P (n), will be 

In every set of n horses, all are the same color. 

9 

(6) 

Base case:  (n = 1). P (1)  is true, because in a set of horses of size 1, there’s only one horse, and this 
horse is deﬁnitely the same color as itself. 
Inductive  step:  Assume  that  P (n) is  true  for  some  n  ≥  1.  that  is,  assume  that  in  every  set  of  n 
horses, all are the same color. Now consider a set of n +  1  horses: 

h1 ,  h2 ,  . . . ,   hn ,  hn+1 
By our assumption, the ﬁrst n horses are the same color: 
�� 
� 
� 
h1 ,  h2 ,  . . . ,   hn , hn+1 
same color 
Also by our assumption, the last n horses are the same color: 
� 
� 
�� 
h1 ,  h2 ,  . . . ,  hn ,  hn+1 
same color 
Therefore, horses h1 , h2 , . . . , hn+1  must all be the same color, and so P (n +  1)  is true.  Thus, P (n) 
implies P (n +  1). 
By the principle of induction, P (n) is true for all n ≥ 1. 

We’ve proved something false!  Is Math broken?  Should we all become poets? 
The  error  in  this  argument  is  in  the  sentence  that begins,  “Therefore,  horses h1 ,  h2 ,  . . . ,  hn ,  hn+1 
must all be  the same color.”  The “. . . ” notation creates  the  impression  that  the sets h1 , h2 , . . . , hn 
and h2 , . . . , hn , hn+1  overlap. However, this is not true when n = 1.  In that case, the ﬁrst set is just 
h1  and the second is h2 , and these do not overlap at all! 
This mistake  knocks  a  critical  link  out  of  our  induction  argument.  We  proved  P (1)  and we  cor­
rectly  proved  P (2)  −→  P (3),  P (3)  −→  P (4),  etc.  But we  failed  to  prove  P (1)  −→  P (2),  and  so 
everything  falls  apart:  we  can  not  conclude  that P (2),  P (3),  etc.,  are  true.  And,  of  course,  these 
propositions are all false; there are horses of a different color. 
Students sometimes claim that the mistake in the proof is because P (n) is false for n ≥ 2, and the 
proof assumes something false, namely, P (n), in order to prove P (n + 1). You should think about 
how to explain to such a student why this claim would get no credit on a 6.042 exam. 

3  Strong Induction 

3.1  The Strong Induction Principle 

A useful variant of  induction  is called  strong  induction.  Strong  induction and ordinary  induction 
are used for exactly the same thing: proving that a predicate P (n) is true for all n ∈ N. 

10 

Course Notes, Week 3:  Induction


Principle of Strong Induction.  Let P (n) be a predicate.  If 

•  P (0)  is true, and 
•  for all n ∈ N, P (0), P (1), . . . , P (n) together imply P (n + 1), 

then P (n) is true for all n ∈ N. 

The  only  change  from  the  ordinary  induction  principle  is  that  strong  induction  allows  you  to 
assume more  stuff  in  the  inductive  step  of  your  proof!  In  an  ordinary  induction  argument,  you 
assume that P (n) is true and try to prove that P (n+ 1) is also true.  In a strong induction argument, 
you may assume that P (0), P (1), . . . , and P (n) are all true when you go to prove P (n + 1).  These 
extra assumptions can only make your job easier. 

3.2  Products of Primes 

As  a ﬁrst  example, we’ll use  strong  induction  to prove  one  of  those  familiar  facts  that  is  almost, 
but maybe not entirely, obvious: 

Lemma 3.1.  Every integer greater than 1 is a product of primes. 

Note that, by convention, any number is considered to be a product consisting of one term, namely 
itself.  In particular, every prime is considered to be a product whose terms are all primes. 

Proof.  We will prove Lemma 3.1 by strong induction, letting the induction hypothesis, P (n), be 

n + 2 is a product of primes. 
So Lemma 3.1 will follow if we prove that P (n) holds for all n ≥ 0. 
Base Case: P (0)  is true because 0 + 2 is prime, and so is a product of primes by convention. 
Inductive step:  Suppose that n ≥ 0 and that i + 2 is a product of primes for every natural number 
i < n + 1.  We must show that P (n + 1)  holds, namely, that n + 3 is also a product of primes.  We 
argue by cases: 
If n + 3 is itself prime, then it is a product of primes by convention, so P (n + 1)  holds in this case. 
Otherwise, n + 3 is not prime, which by deﬁnition means n + 3  =  km for some natural numbers 
k , m  such  that  2  ≤  k , m  <  n +  3.  So  k −  2  is  a  natural  number  less  than  n +  1,  which  means 
that (k − 2) + 2 is a product of primes by induction hypothesis.  That is, k is a product of primes. 
Likewise, m is a product of primes.  So km =  n + 3 is also a product of primes. Therefore, P (n + 1) 
holds in this case as well. 
So P (n + 1)  holds in any case, which completes the proof by strong induction that P (n) holds for 
all natural numbers, n. 

Course Notes, Week 3:  Induction

Despite the name, strong induction is actually no more powerful than ordinary induction.  In other 
words, any theorem that can be proved with strong induction could also be proved with ordinary 
induction  (using  a  slightly  more  complicated  indcution  hypothesis).  But  strong  induction  can 
make  some  proofs  a  bit  easier.  On  the  other  hand,  if P (n) is  easily  sufﬁcient  to  prove P (n +  1), 
then it’s better to use ordinary induction for simplicity. 

3.3  Making Change 

The  country  Inductia,  whose  unit  of  currency  is  the  Strong,  has  coins worth  6S  (6  Strongs),  10S 
and 15S. Although the Inductians have some trouble making small change like 11S or 29S, it turns 
out that they can collect coins to make change for any number of Strongs greater than 29S. 
Strong  induction makes  this  easy  to prove  for n +  1  > 35,  because  then  (n +  1)  − 6  > 29,  so  by 
strong induction the Inductians can make change for exactly ((n + 1) − 6)S, and then they can add 
a  6S  coin  to  get  (n +  1)S.  So  the  only  thing  to  do  is  check  that  they  can make  change  for  all  the 
amounts from 30 to 35, which is not too hard to do. 
Here’s a detailed writeup using the ofﬁcial format: 

Proof.  We  prove  the  Inductians  can make  change  for  any  amount  greater  than  29S  by  strong  in­
duction. The induction hypothesis, P (n) will be: 

If n > 29, then there is a collection of coins whose value is n Strongs. 

Notice  that P (n) is an  implication.  When  the hypothesis of an  implication  is  false, we know  the

whole  implication  is  true.  In  this  situation,  the  implication  is  said  to  be  vacuously  true.  So  P (n)

will be vacuously true whenever n ≤ 29.

We now proceed with the induction proof:

Base case: P (0)  is vacuously true.

Inductive step:  We assume P (i) holds for all i ≤  n, and prove that P (n +  1)  holds.  We argue by

cases:

Case (n +  1  ≤ 29): P (n +  1)  is vacuously true in this case.

Case (n +  1  = 30): P (30)  holds because the Inductians can use ﬁve 6S coins.

Case (n +  1  = 31): Use a 6S coin, a 10S coin and a 15S coin.

Case (n +  1  = 32): Use two 6S coins, and two 10S coins.

Case (n +  1  = 33): Use three 6S coin, and a 15S coin.

Case (n +  1  = 34): Use a four 6S coins, and a 10S coin.

Case (n +  1  = 35): Use a two 10S coins and a 15S coin.

Case (n + 1  > 35): Then n ≥ (n + 1) − 6  > 29, so by the strong induction hypothesis, the Inductians

can make change for ((n + 1)  − 6)S. Now by adding a 6S coin, they can make change for (n + 1)S.

So  in  any  case,  P (n +  1)  is  true,and  we  conclude  by  strong  induction  that  for  all  n  >  29,  the

Inductians can make change for nS.

Note  that,  as  with  tiling  with  L­shaped  pieces,  this  proof  also  yields  a  recursive  procedure  for 
making  change.  In  fact,  it  shows  even  more:  the  Inductians  can  make  change  for  any  amount 
greater than 29S using only one 15S coin, at most two 10S coins, and lots of 6S coins. 

3.4  Unstacking 

Here is another exciting 6.042 game that’s surely about to sweep the nation! 

You  begin  with  a  stack  of  n  boxes.  Then  you  make  a  sequence  of  moves.  In  each  move,  you 
divide one stack of boxes into two nonempty stacks. The game ends when you have n stacks, each 
containing  a  single  box.  You  earn points  for  each move;  in particular,  if  you divide  one  stack  of 
height  a + b into  two  stacks with  heights  a  and  b,  then  you  score  ab  points  for  that move.  Your 
overall score is the sum of the points that you earn for each move.  What strategy should you use 
to maximize your total score? 
As an example, suppose that we begin with a stack of n = 10 boxes. Then the game might proceed 
as follows:

3.4.1  Analyzing the Game 

Let’s use  strong  induction  to  analyze  the unstacking game.  We’ll prove  that your  score  is deter­
mined entirely by the number of boxes —your strategy is irrelevant! 
Theorem 3.2.  Every way of unstacking n blocks gives a score of n(n − 1)/2 points. 

There are a couple technical points to notice in the proof: 

•	 The template for a strong induction proof is exactly the same as for ordinary induction. 

•	 As with ordinary induction, we have some freedom to adjust indices.  In this case, we prove 
P (1) in  the  base  case  and  prove  that  P (1), . . . , P (n  −  1) imply  P (n) for  all  n  ≥  2 in  the 
inductive step.

Proof.  The proof is by strong induction. Let P (n) be the proposition that every way of unstacking 
n  blocks gives a score of n(n  − 1)/2. 
Base case:  If n  = 1, then there is only one block.  No moves are possible, and so the total score for 
the game is 1(1  − 1)/2  = 0. Therefore, P (1)  is true. 
Inductive  step:  Now we must  show  that P (1),  . . . ,  P (n  − 1)  imply P (n) for  all n  ≥  2.  So  assume 
that P (1), . . . , P (n  − 1)  are all true and that we have a stack of n   blocks. The ﬁrst move must split 
this stack into substacks with sizes k  and n  − k  for some k  strictly between 0 and n. Now the total 
score for the game is the sum of points for this ﬁrst move plus points obtained by unstacking the 
two resulting substacks: 

total score =  (score for 1st move) 
+  (score for unstacking k   blocks) 
+  (score for unstacking n   − k  blocks) 
=  k(n  − k) +  k(k  − 1)
(n  − k)(n  − k  − 1)

The second equation uses the assumptions P (k) and P (n  − k) and the rest is simpliﬁcation.  This 
shows that P (1), P (2), . . . , P (n) imply P (n  +  1). 
Therefore, the claim is true by strong induction.

4  The Well Ordering Principle 

Another proof method closely related to induction depends on the 

Well Ordering Principle.  Every nonempty subset of natural numbers 
has a smallest element. 

The Well Ordering Principle looks nothing like the induction axiom, and it may seem obvious but 
useless. 
But as for obvious, note that this axiom would be false if the set of non­negative integers, N, were 
replaced  by,  say,  the  set,  Z,  of  all  integers,  or  the  set,  Q+ ,  of  positive  rational  numbers.  Neither 
of  these  sets has  a  least  element.  So  the Well Ordering Principle does  capture  something  special 
about the natural numbers. 
As  for  useless,  it  turns  out  that  there’s  a  routine way  to  transform  any  proof  using  the Well Or­
dering Principle  into a proof using Strong  Induction,  and vice­versa.  (We won’t  take  the  time  to 
describe the transformations,  though they are not hard.)  So Well Ordering could have been used 
instead of induction in all the previous proofs.

√
In  fact,  looking  back, we  implicitly  relied  on  the Well Ordering  Principle  in  the  proof  in Week  2 
2  is  irrational.  That proof assumed  that any  rational number,  q ,  could be written as 
Notes  that 
a  fraction  in  lowest  terms,  that  is,  q  =  m/n  where m  and n  are  integers with no  common  factors. 
How do we know this is always possible? 
First, we can assume m  ≥ 0  (otherwise, replace m/n   by −m/(−n)), so the set of natural numbers, 
m,  such  that q  =  m/n  for some  integer, n,  is not empty.  Therefore, by Well Ordering,  there must 
be a  least natural number, m0 ,  such  that  q  =  m0/n0  for  some  integer, n0 .  Now  if m0  and n0  had 
a  common  factor,  p >  1,  then  (m0/p)/(n0/p) would be another way  to express  q  as a quotient of 
integers. But since 0  ≤ (m0/p) < m0 .  this contradicts the minimality of m0 . 
We’ve using the Well­ordering Principle on the sly from early on! 
Mathematicians  often use Well Ordering  because  it  often  leads  to  shorter proofs  than  induction. 
On the other hand, Well Ordering proofs typically involve proof by contradiction, so using it is not 
always the best approach. The choice of method is really a matter of style—but style does matter.
