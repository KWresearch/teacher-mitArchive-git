1  Counting Subsets 

How many k­elements  subsets of an n­element  set are  there?  This question arises all  the  time  in 
various guises: 

•  In how many ways can I select 5 books from my collection of 100 to bring on vacation? 

•  How many different 13­card Bridge hands can be dealt from a 52­card deck? 

•  In how many ways can I select 5 toppings for my pizza if there are 14 available? 
�  � 
This number comes up so often that there is a special notation for it: 
n 
::=  the number of k­element subsets of an n­element set.

The expression “ 
” is read “n­choose­k .”  Now we can immediately express the answers to all

1.1  The Subset Rule 

We  can  derive  a  simple  formula  for  n­choose­k number  using  the Division  Rule.  We  do  this  by 
mapping any permutation of an n­element set {a1 , . . . , an} into a k­element subset simply by tak­
ing the ﬁrst k elements of the permutation. That is, the permutation a1a2  . . . an  will map to the set 
{a1 , a2 , . . . , ak }. 
Notice  that  any  other  permutation with  the  same  ﬁrst  k elements  a1 , . . . , ak  in  any  order  and  the 
same remaining elements n − k elements in any order will also map to this set. What’s more, a per­
mutation can only map to {a1 , a2 , . . . , ak } if its ﬁrst k elements are the elements a1 , . . . , ak  in some

order. Since there are k ! possible permutations of the ﬁrst k elements and (n − k)!  permutations the 
remaining elements, we conclude from the Product Rule that exactly k !(n− k)!  permutations of the 
n­element set map to the the particular subset, S .  In other words, the mapping from permutations 
to k­element subsets is k !(n − k)!­to­1.

But we know there are n!  permutations of an n­element set, so by the Division Rule, we conclude 
that 
n! =  k !(n − k)!

Rule 1 (Subset Rule).  The number, 

which proves: 

of k­element subsets of an n­element set is 

n!  
k !  (n − k)! . 

Notice  that  this works  even  for  0­element  subsets:  n!/0!n!   = 1.  Here we  use  the  fact  that  0!  is  a 
product of 0 terms, which by convention equals 1.  (A sum of zero terms equals 0.) 

1.2  Bit Sequences 

How many n­bit sequences contain exactly k ones? We’ve already seen the straightforward bijec­
tion  between  subsets  of  an  n­element  set  and  n­bit  sequences.  For  example,  here  is  a  3­element 
subset of {x1 , x2 , . . . , x8} and the associated 8­bit sequence: 
{
( 

x4 , x5 
1, 
1, 

0,   0,   0 

x1 ,
1, 

0,  0, 

}
) 

Notice  that  this  sequence  has  exactly  3  ones,  each  corresponding  to  an  element  of  the  3­element 
subset. More generally, the n­bit sequences corresponding to a k­element subsets will have exactly 
�  � 
k ones.  So by the Bijection Rule, 
n
The number of n­bit sequences with exactly k ones is

2  Magic Trick 

There is a Magician and an Assistant. The Assistant goes into the audience with a deck of 52 cards 
while  the Magician  looks away.  Five audience members each select one card  from  the deck.  The 
Assistant then gathers up the ﬁve cards and holds up four of them so the Magician can see them. 
The Magician concentrates for a short time and then correctly names the secret, ﬁfth card! 
Since we don’t really believe the Magician can read minds, we know the Assistant has somehow 
communicated  the  secret  card  to  the  Magician.  Since  real  Magicians  and  Assistants  are  not  to 
be  trusted, we can expect  that  the Assistant would  illegitimately signal  the Magician with coded 

Course Notes, Week 10: Counting, II. 

3 

phrases or body language. But this need not happen.  In fact, the Magician and Assistant could be 
kept out of sight of each other with the Assistant designating some audience member to hold up 
the 4 cards he selects. 

But  there  is  an  obvious,  legitimate way  the Assistant  can  communicate  to  the Magician:  he  can 
choose any of the 4!  =  24   permutations of the 4 cards as the order in which to hold up the cards. 
However,  this alone won’t quite work:  there are 48 cards remaining  in  the deck, so  the Assistant 
doesn’t have enough choices of orders to indicate exactly what the secret card is (though he could 
narrow it down to two cards). 

2.1  The Secret 

The method  the  Assistant  can  use  to  communicate  the  ﬁfth  card  exactly  is  a  nice  application  of 
what we know about counting and matching. 

The  Assistant  really  has  two  legitimate  ways  to  communicate.  He  can  not  only  announce  the 
four  cards  in any order,  but he  can also  choose which  four  of  the ﬁve  cards  to  reveal.  Of  course,  the 
Magician can not determine which of these ﬁve possibilities the Assistant selected, since he does 
not know the secret card. 

Nevertheless,  these legitimate forms of communication allow the Assistant to covertly reveal the 
secret card to the Magician. 
Our counting tools give a lot of insight into the magic trick. Put all the sets of 5 cards in a collection 
X on the left. And put all the sequences of 4 distinct cards in a collection Y  on the right. 

X  = 
all sets of 
5 cards 

• 
• 
• 
• 
{8♥, K♠, Q♠, 2♦, 6♦} 
• 
• 
{8♥, K♠, Q♠, 9♣, 6♦} 
• 

• 
Y  =  all 
• 
sequences of 4 
• 
distinct cards 
(((((((((((((  (8♥, K♠, Q♠, 2♦) 
 
(K♠, 8♥, Q♠, 2♦) 
hhhhhhhhhhhhh 
PPPPPP 
(K♠, 8♥, 6♦, Q♠) 
• 
 
• 
• 

For example, {8♥, K♠, Q♠, 2♦, 6♦} is an element of X on the left.  If the audience selects this set 
of 5 cards,  then there are many different 4­card sequences on the right in set Y  that the Assistant 
could choose to reveal, including (8♥, K♠, Q♠, 2♦), (K♠, 8♥, Q♠, 2♦), and (K♠, 8♥, 6♦, Q♠). 
Let’s think about this problem in terms of graphs. Regard the elements of X and Y  as the vertices 
of a bipartite graph.  Put an edge between a set of 5 cards and a sequence of 4 if every card in the 
sequence is also in the set.  In other words, if the audience selects a set of cards, then the Assistant 
must reveal a sequence of cards  that  is adjacent  in  the bipartite graph.  Some edges are shown  in 
the diagram above. 

4	

Course Notes, Week 10: Counting, II. 

What  we  need  to  perform  the  trick  is  a  matching  for  the  X  vertices;  that  is,  we  need  a  subset 
of  edges  that  join  every  vertex  on  the  left  to  exactly  one,  distinct  vertex  on  the  right.  If  such 
a  matching  exists,  then  the  Assistant  and  Magician  can  agree  one  in  advance.  Then,  when  the 
audience  selects  a  set  of  5  cards,  the  Assistant  reveals  the  corresponding  sequence  of  4  cards. 
The Magician  translates back  to  the  corresponding  set of  5  cards  and names  the one not  already 
revealed. 
For  example,  suppose  the Assistant  and Magician  agree  on  a matching  containing  the  two  bold 
edges  in  the  diagram  above.  If  the  audience  selects  the  set  {8♥, K♠, Q♠, 9♣, 6♦},  then  the  As­
sistant reveals  the corresponding sequence (K♠, 8♥, 6♦, Q♠).  The Magician names  the one card 
in the corresponding set not already revealed, the 9♣.  Notice that the sets must be matched with 
distinct sequences;  if  the Assistant revealed  the same sequence when  the audience picked  the set 
{8♥, K♠, Q♠, 2♦, 6♦},  then  the Magician would  be unable  to determine whether  the  remaining 
card was the 9♣ or 2♦! 
The only remaining question is whether a matching for the X vertices exists.  This is precisely the 
subject of Hall’s Theorem. Regard the X vertices as girls, the Y  vertices as boys, and each edge as 
an indication that a girl likes a boy. Then a matching for the girls exists if and only if the marriage 
condition is satisﬁed: 

Every subset of girls likes at least as large a set of boys. 

Let’s  prove  that  the  marriage  condition  holds  for  the  magic  trick  graph.  We’ll  need  a  couple 
preliminary facts: 

· 
•	 Each  vertex  on  the  left  has  degree  5  4!  =  120,  since  there  are  ﬁve ways  to  select  the  card 
kept secret and there are 4!  permutations of the remaining 4 cards.  In terms of the marriage 
metaphor, every girl like 120 boys. 

•	 Each vertex on the right has degree 48, since there are 48 possibilities for the ﬁfth card. Thus, 
every boy is liked by 48 girls. 

Now  let  S  be  an  arbitrary  set  of  vertices  on  the  left,  which  we’re  regarding  as  girls.  There  are 
120  |S |  edges  incident  to  vertices  in  this  set.  Since  each  boy  is  liked  by  at most  48  girls,  this  set 
of  girls  likes  at  least  120  S /48  ≥  S different  boys.  Thus,  the marriage  condition  is  satisﬁed,  a

matching exists by Hall’s Theorem.  In fact, this reasoning show that the Magician could still pull 
off the trick if 120 cards were left instead of 48, that is the trick would work with a deck as large as 
124 different cards — without any magic! 

2.2  The Real Secret 

�	 � 
You  might  not  ﬁnd  the  preceding  answer  very  satisfying.  After  all,  as  a  practical  matter,  the 
Assistant  and  the  Magician  can  not  memorize  a  matching  containing  52  = 2, 598, 960  edges!
5 
The  remaining  challenge  is  to  choose  a matching  that  can  be  readily  computed  on  the  ﬂy.  We’ll 
describe one approach. As an running example, suppose that the audience selects: 
10♥  9♦  3♥  Q♠  J ♦ 

Course Notes, Week 10: Counting, II. 

5 

•	 The  Assistant  picks  out  two  cards  of  the  same  suit.  In  the  example,  the  assistant  might 
choose the 3♥ and 10♥. 
•	 The Assistant locates the values of these two cards on the cycle shown below: 

K 

A

2 

Q 

J	

10	

9

3 

4 

5 

6 

8 

7 

For any two distinct values on this cycle, one is always between 1 and 6 hops clockwise from 
the other.  For example, the 3♥ is 6 hops clockwise from the 10♥. 
•	 The more  counterclockwise  of  these  two  cards  is  revealed  ﬁrst,  and  the  other  becomes  the 
secret  card.  Thus,  in  our  example,  the  10♥  would  be  revealed,  and  the  3♥  would  be  the 
secret card. Therefore: 

–	 The suit of the secret card is the same as the suit of the ﬁrst card revealed. 
–	 The  value  of  the  secret  card  is  between  1  and  6  hops  clockwise  from  the  value  of  the 
ﬁrst card revealed. 

•	 All that remains is to communicate a number between 1 and 6.  The Magician and Assistant 
agree beforehand on an ordering of all the cards in the deck from smallest to largest such as: 
A♣ 2♣  . . .  K♣ A♦ 2♦  . . .  Q♦ A♥ 2♥  . . .  Q♥ A♠ 2♠  . . .  Q♠ 

The order in which the last three cards are revealed communicates the number according to 
the following scheme: 

) = 1 
( 
small,  medium,  
large 
large,  medium  ) = 2 
( 
small, 
( medium, 
) = 3 
small,  
large 
( medium, 
) = 4 
large, 
small 
small,   medium  ) = 5 
( 
large,  
( 
) = 6 
large,   medium, 
small 

In  the  example,  the  Assistant wants  to  send  6  and  so  reveals  the  remaining  three  cards  in 
large, medium, small order. Here is the complete sequence that the Magician sees: 
♥
Q♠  J ♦  9
♦ 
10

•	 The Magician starts with the ﬁrst card, 10♥, and hops 6 values clockwise to reach 3♥, which 
is the secret card!

2.3  Same Trick with Four Cards? 

Suppose that the audience selects only four cards and the Assistant reviews a sequence of three to 
the Magician. Can the Magician determine the fourth card? 
Let X be all the sets of four cards that the audience might select, and let Y  be all the sequences of 
� � 
three cards that the Assistant might reveal. Now, one on hand, we have 
52 
X | = 
|
4 

=  270, 725

by the Subset Rule. On the other hand, we have 
|Y | = 52  51  50  = 132, 600
·
·

by the Generalized Product Rule. Thus, by the Pigeonhole Principle, the Assistant must reveal the 
same sequence of three cards for some two different sets of four. This is bad news for the Magician: 
if he hears that sequence of three, then there are at least two possibilities for the fourth card which 
he cannot distinguish. So there is no legitimate way for the Assistant to communicate exactly what 
the fourth card is! 

3  The Bookkeeper Rule 

3.1  Sequences of Subsets 

Choosing a k­element subset of an n­element is the same as splitting the set into a pair of subsets: 
the  ﬁrst  subset  of  size  k  and  the  second  subset  consisting  of  the  remaining  n − k  elements.  So 
the  Subset Rule  can be understood  as  a  rule  for  counting  the number  of  such  splits  into pairs  of 
subsets. 
We can generalize this to splits into m subsets. Namely, let A be an n­element set and k1 , k2 , . . . , km 
be nonnegative integers whose sum is n. A (k1 , k2 , . . . , km )­split of A is a sequence 

(A1 , A2 , . . . , Am ) 
where the Ai  are pairwise disjoint subsets of A and  Ai | =  ki  for i = 1, . . . , m.
|
The  same  reasoning  used  to  explain  the  Subset  Rule  extends  directly  to  a  rule  for  counting  the 
number of splits into subsets of given sizes. 
� 
� 
Rule 2 (Subset Split Rule).  The number of (k1 , k2 , . . . , km )­splits of an n­element set is 
n!  
n
::= 
· · ·
k1 ! k2 ! 
k1 , . . . , km 

km !

The proof of this Rule is essentially the same as for the Subset Rule. Namely, we map any permu­
tation a1a2  . . . an  of an n­element set, A, into a (k1 , k2 , . . . , km )­split by letting the 1st subset in the 
split be the ﬁrst k1  elements of the permutation, the 2nd subset of the split be the next k1  elements, 
. . . ,  and  the  mth  subset  of  the  split  be  the  ﬁnal  km  elements  of  the  permutation.  This  map  is  a 
· · · 
k1 ! k2 ! 
kk !­to­1 from the n! permutations to the (k1 , k2 , . . . , km )­splits of A, and the Subset Split 
Rule now follows from the Division Rule. 

Course Notes, Week 10: Counting, II. 

3.2  Sequences over an alphabet 

7 

We  can  also generalize our  count of n­bit  sequences with  k­ones  to  counting  length n sequences 
of letters over an alphabet with more than two letters.  For example, how many sequences can be 
formed by permuting the letters in the 10­letter word BOOKKEEPER? 
Notice that there are 1 B, 2 O’s, 2 K’s, 3 E’s, 1 P, and 1 R in BOOKKEEPER. This leads to a straight­
forward  bijection  between  permutations  of  BOOKKEEPER  and  (1,2,2,3,1,1)­splits  of  {1, . . . , n}. 
Namely, map a permutation to the sequence of sets of positions where each of the different letters 
occur. 
For example, in the permutation BOOKKEEPER itself, the B is in the 1st position, the O’s occur in 
the 2nd and 3rd positions, K’s in 4th and 5th, the E’s in the 6th, 7th and 9th, P in the 8th, and R is 
in the 10th position, so BOOKKEEPER maps to 
({1} , {2, 3} , {4, 5} , {6, 7, 9} , {8} , {10}). 

From  this bijection and  the Subset Split Rule, we conclude  that  the number of ways  to rearrange 
the letters in the word BOOKKEEPER is: 
���� 
total letters 
���� ���� ���� ���� ���� ���� 
10!  
1!
1!
1!
2!
2!
3!
B’s  O’s  K’s  E’s  P’s  R’s 
This example generalizes directly to an exceptionally useful counting principle which we will call 
the 

Rule 3 (Bookkeeper Rule).  Let l1 , . . . , lm  be distinct elements.  The number of sequences with k1  occur­
rences of l1 , and k2  occurrences of l2 , . . . , and km  occurrences of lm  is 

(k1  +  k2  +  . . . +  km )! 
k1 !  k2 !  . . .  km ! 

Example.  20­Mile Walks. 
I’m planning a 20­mile walk, which should include 5 northward miles, 5 eastward miles, 5 south­
ward miles, and 5 westward miles. How many different walks are possible? 
There  is a bijection between such walks and sequences with 5 N’s, 5 E’s, 5 S’s, and 5 W’s.  By the 
Bookkeeper Rule, the number of such sequences is: 

20!  
5!4 

3.3  A Word about Words 

Someday  you might  refer  to  the  Subset  Split  Rule  or  the  Bookkeeper  Rule  in  front  of  a  roomful 
of colleagues and discover that they’re all staring back at you blankly.  This is not because they’re 
dumb, but rather because we made up the name “Bookkeeper Rule”.  However,  the rule is excel­
lent and the name is apt, so we suggest that you play through: “You know? The Bookkeeper Rule? 
Don’t you guys know anything???” 

8 

Course Notes, Week 10: Counting, II. 

The  Bookkeeper  Rule  is  sometimes  called  the  “formula  for  permutations with  indistinguishable 
objects.”  The  size  k subsets  of  an  n­element  set  are  sometimes  called  k­combinations.  Other 
similar­sounding  descriptions  are  “combinations  with  repetition,  permutations  with  repetition, 
r­permutations, permutations with indistinguishable objects,” and so on.  However, the counting 
rules  we’ve  taught  you  are  sufﬁcient  to  solve  all  these  sorts  of  problems  without  knowing  this 
jargon, so we’ll skip it. 

4  Poker Hands 

There are 52 cards in a deck. Each card has a suit and a value. There are four suits: 

spades 
♠ 

hearts 
♥ 

clubs 
♣ 

diamonds 
♦ 

And there are 13 values: 

jack  queen  king  ace 
2  , 3  , 4 , 5  , 6  , 7 , 8  , 9  , J ,  Q 
, K , A 
Thus, for example, 8♥ is the 8 of hearts and A♠ is the ace of spades.  Values farther to the right in 
this list are considered “higher ” and values to the left are “lower ”. 
Five­Card Draw  is a card game  in which each player  is  initially dealt a hand,  a  subset of 5 cards. 
(Then the game gets complicated, but let’s not worry about that.)  The number of different hands 
� � 
in Five­Card Draw is the number of 5­element subsets of a 52­element set, which is 52 choose 5: 
52
5 

total # of hands = 

= 2, 598, 960

Let’s get some counting practice by working out the number of hands with various special prop­
erties. 

4.1  Hands with a Four­of­a­Kind 

A Four­of­a­Kind  is a set of  four cards with  the same value.  How many different hands contain a 
Four­of­a­Kind? Here a couple examples: 
8♦,  Q♥,  8♥, 
{ 
8♠, 
8♣
2♦,  2♠∗} 
A♣,  2♣, 
2♥,
{ 

} 

As  usual,  the  ﬁrst  step  is  to map  this  question  to  a  sequence­counting  problem.  A  hand with  a 
Four­of­a­Kind is completely described by a sequence specifying: 

1.  The value of the four cards. 

2.  The value of the extra card. 

3.  The suit of the extra card. 

Course Notes, Week 10: Counting, II. 

9 

Thus,  there  is  a  bijection  between  hands with  a  Four­of­a­Kind  and  sequences  consisting  of  two 
distinct  values  followed  by  a  suit.  For  example,  the  three  hands  above  are  associated  with  the 
following sequences: 

(8, Q, ♥)  ↔ 
(2, A, ♣)  ↔

8♠, 8♦, 8♥, 8♣, Q
♥ }
{ 
2♣, 2♥, 2♦, 2♠, A
♣ } 
{ 
Now we need only  count  the  sequences.  There are 13 ways  to  choose  the ﬁrst value,  12 ways  to 
choose  the  second value,  and 4 ways  to  choose  the  suit.  Thus,  by  the Generalized Product Rule, 
·
· 
there are 13   12 4  = 624  hands with a Four­of­a­Kind. This means that only 1 hand in about 4165 
has a Four­of­a­Kind; not surprisingly, this is considered a very good poker hand! 

4.2  Hands with a Full House 

A  Full  House  is  a  hand  with  three  cards  of  one  value  and  two  cards  of  another  value.  Here  are 
some examples: 
♦ }
{ 
2♠, 2♣, 2♦, J ♣, J
{
} 
7♣ 
5♦, 5♣, 5♥, 7♥, 
Again,  we  shift  to  a  problem  about  sequences.  There  is  a  bijection  between  Full  Houses  and 
sequences specifying: 
� � 
1.  The value of the triple, which can be chosen in 13 ways. 
2.  The suits of the triple, which can be selected in  4
3 ways. 
� � 
3.  The value of the pair, which can be chosen in 12 ways.

4.  The suits of the pair, which can be selected in  4
2 ways. 
The example hands correspond to sequences as shown below: 
♦ }
{♣, ♦})  ↔ { 
2♠, 2♣, 2♦, J ♣, J
{♠, ♣, ♦} ,
(2,
7♣
5♦, 5♣, 5♥, 7♥, 
{♥, ♣})  ↔ { 
(5, {♦, ♣, ♥} ,
} 
� � 
� � 
By the Generalized Product Rule, the number of Full Houses is:

4.3  Hands with Two Pairs 

How many hands have Two Pairs; that is, two cards of one value, two cards of another value, and 
one card of a third value? Here are examples: 
3♦, 3♠, Q♦, Q♥, A
{ 
♣ }
♠ } 
{ 
5♣, K
5♥, 
9♥, 9♦, 
Each hand with Two Pairs is described by a sequence consisting of: 

10

1.  The value of the ﬁrst pair, which can be chosen in 13 ways.

2.  The suits of the ﬁrst pair, which can be selected  ways.

3.  The value of the second pair, which can be chosen in 12 ways.

4.  The suits of the second pair, which can be selected in  4

5.  The value of the extra card, which can be chosen in 11 ways.

6.  The suit of the extra card, which can be selected in  4

Thus, it might appear that the number of hands with Two Pairs is:

Wrong answer! The problem is that there is not a bijection from such sequences to hands with Two 
Pairs.  This is actually a 2­to­1 mapping.  For example, here are the pairs of sequences that map to 
the hands given above: 
(3,  {♦,  ♠} ,  Q,  {♦,  ♥} ,  A,   ♣)  � 
(Q,  {♦,  ♥} ,  3,  {♦,  ♠} ,  A,  ♣)  �
(9,  {♥,  ♦} ,  5,  {♥,  ♣} ,  K,   ♠)  � 
(5,  {♥,  ♣} ,  9,  {♥,  ♦} ,  K,   ♠)  �
The problem is that nothing distinguishes the ﬁrst pair from the second. A pair of 5’s and a pair of 
9’s is the same as a pair of 9’s and a pair of 5’s. We avoided this difﬁculty in counting Full Houses 
because, for example, a pair of 6’s and a triple of kings is different from a pair of kings and a triple 
of 6’s. 
We ran into precisely this difﬁculty last time, when we went from counting arrangements of differ­
ent pieces on a chessboard to counting arrangements of two identical rooks. The solution then was 
to apply the Division Rule, and we can do the same here.  In this case, the Division rule says there

Another Approach 

The preceding example was disturbing!  One could easily overlook the fact that the mapping was 
2­to­1 on an exam, fail the course, and turn to a life of crime. You can make the world a safer place 
in two ways: 

→
:  A
B  to  translate  one  counting  problem  to  another, 
1.  Whenever  you  use  a  mapping  f 
check the number elements in A  that are mapped to each element in B .  This determines the 
size of A  relative to B . You can then apply the Division Rule with the appropriate correction 
factor.

2.  As an extra check, try solving the same problem in a different way. Multiple approaches are 
often available— and all had better give the same answer!  (Sometimes different approaches 
give answers that look different, but turn out to be the same after some algebra.) 
We already used the ﬁrst method; let’s try the second. There is a bijection between hands with two 
� �  � � � � 
pairs and sequences that specify: 
1.  The values of the two pairs, which can be chosen in  13 
2 ways. 
2.  The suits of the lower­value pair, which can be selected in  4
2 ways. 
3.  The suits of the higher­value pair, which can be selected in  4
2 ways. 
� � 
4.  The value of the extra card, which can be chosen in 11  ways. 
5.  The suit of the extra card, which can be selected in  4
1  =  4 ways. 

For example, the following sequences and hands correspond: 
3♠, 
3♦, 
{
({3, Q} , {♦, ♠} , {♦, ♥} , A, ♣)  ↔
({9, 5} , {♥, ♣} , {♥, ♦} , K, ♠)  ↔ 
{ 
9♥, 
9♦,

Thus, the number of hands with two pairs is:

This is the same answer we got before, though in a slightly different form. 

4.4  Hands with Every Suit 

How many hands contain at least one card from every suit? Here is an example of such a hand: 
} 
{
7♦, K♣,  3♦, A♥,  2♠

Each such hand is described by a sequence that speciﬁes: 

1.  The  values  of  the  diamond,  the  club,  the  heart,  and  the  spade,  which  can  be  selected  in 
·
·
· 
13   13  13  13 = 134  ways.

2.  The suit of the extra card, which can be selected in 4 ways. 

3.  The value of the extra card, which can be selected in 12 ways. 

For example, the hand above is described by the sequence: 
(7, K, A, 2, ♦, 3) 
7♦, K♣, A♥,  2♠,  3♦
↔ { 

} 

12 

Course Notes, Week 10: Counting, II. 

Are there other sequences that correspond to the same hand? There is one more! We could equally 
well regard either the 3♦ or the 7♦ as the extra card, so this is actually a 2­to­1 mapping. Here are 
the two sequences corresponding to the example hand: 
(7,  K,  A,  2,  ♦,  3)  � 
(3,  K,  A,  2,  ♦,  7)  � 

7♦, K♣, A♥,  2♠,  3♦

Therefore, the number of hands with every suit is:

5  Binomial Theorem 

Counting  gives  insight  into  one  of  the  basic  theorems  of  algebra.  A  binomial  is  a  sum  of  two 
terms, such as a  +  b. Now consider its 4th power, (a   +  b)4  . 
If we multiply out this 4th power expression completely, we get 

(a  +  b)4  = 

aaaa  +  aaab  +  aaba  +  aabb 
+  abaa  +  abab  +  abba  +  abbb 
+ 
baaa  + 
baab  + 
baba  + 
babb 
bbba  + 
bbab  + 
bbaa  + 
+ 
bbbb  
Notice  that  there  is  one  term  for  every  sequence  of  a’s  and  b’s.  So  there  are  24  terms,  and  the 
�  � 
number of terms with k  copies of b   and n   − k  copies of a  is: 
n!  
n 
k ! (n  − k)! 
k 
�  � 
by the Bookkeeper Rule.  Now let’s group equivalent terms, such as aaab  =  aaba  =  abaa  =  baaa. 
� � 
� � 
� � 
� � 
� � 
Then the coefﬁcient of an−k bk  is 
n
.  So for n   = 4, this means: 
k

in the expansion of (b + o + k + e + p + r)10 . Each term in this expansion is a product of 10 variables 
where  each  variable  is  one  of  b,  o,  k ,  e,  p,  or  r .  Now,  the  coefﬁcient  of  bo2k2e3pr  is  the  number 
of  those  terms with  exactly  1  b,  2  o’s,  2  k ’s,  3  e’s,  1  p,  and  1  r .  And  the  number  of  such  terms  is

The expression on the left is called a “multinomial coefﬁcient.” This reasoning extends to a general

You’ll be better off remembering the reasoning behind the Multinomial Theorem rather than this 
ugly formal statement. 

6  Combinatorial Proof 

Suppose  you  have  n  different  T­shirts  only want  to  keep  k .  You  could  equally well  select  the  k 
shirts  you want  to  keep  or  select  the  complementary  set  of  n − k  shirts  you want  to  throw  out. 
Thus, the number of ways to select k shirts from among n must be equal to the number of ways to 
�  �  � 
� 
select n − k shirts from among n. Therefore: 
n
n  
= 
n − k 
k

This is easy to prove algebraically, since both sides are equal to: 

But we didn’t really have to resort to algebra; we just used counting principles. 

n!  
k !  (n − k)! 

Hmm. 

6.1  Boxing 

Ishan,  famed  6.042  TA,  has  decided  to  try  out  for  the  US  Olympic  boxing  team.  After  all,  he’s 
watched  all  of  the  Rocky movies  and  spent  hours  in  front  of  a mirror  sneering,  “Yo,  you wanna 
piece a’ me?!”  Ishan ﬁgures that n people (including himself) are competing for spots on the team 
and only k will be selected.  As part of maneuvering  for a spot on  the  team, he need  to work out 
how many different teams are possible. There are two cases to consider: 

14 	

Course Notes, Week 10: Counting, II. 
•	 Ishan  is  selected  for  the  team,  and  his  k  − 1  teammates  are  selected  from  among  the  other 
� 
� 
n  − 1  competitors. The number of different teams that be formed in this way is: 
n  − 1 
k  − 1 
•	 Ishan is not selected for the team, and all k  team members are selected from among the other 
� 
� 
n  − 1  competitors. The number of teams that can be formed this way is: 
n  − 1 
k 
All teams of the ﬁrst type contain Ishan, and no team of the second type does;  therefore,  the two 
� � 
� 
� 
sets  of  teams  are  disjoint.  Thus,  by  the  Sum  Rule,  the  total  number  of  possible Olympic  boxing 
teams is: 
n  − 1 
n  − 1 
+ 
k  − 1 
k

Sayan,  equally­famed  6.042 TA,  thinks  Ishan  isn’t  so  tough  and  so he might  as well  try out  also. 
� � 
He reasons that n  people (including himself) are trying out for k  spots. Thus, the number of ways 
to select the team is simply: 
n 
k 
� � � 
� �

Sayan and Ishan each correctly counted the number of possible boxing teams; thus, their answers 
must be equal.  So we know: 
n  − 1 
n  − 1

= 
k  − 1

This  is  called Pascal’s  Identity.  And we proved  it without  any  algebra!  Instead, we  relied purely 
on counting techniques. 

6.2  Combinatorial Proof 

A  combinatorial  proof  is  an  argument  that  establishes  an  algebraic  fact  by  relying  on  counting 
principles. Many such proofs follow the same basic outline: 

1.  Deﬁne a set S . 
2.  Show that |S | =  n  by counting one way. 
3.  Show that |S | =  m  by counting another way. 
4.  Conclude that n   =  m. 
� 
�  � 
�	
�

In  the  preceding  example,  S  was  the  set  of  all  possible Olympic  boxing  teams.  Ishan  computed 
|S |  =  n−1  +  n−1  by  counting  one way,  and  Sayan  computed  |S |  = 
n
by  counting  another. 
k−1 
k	
k
Equating these two expressions gave Pascal’s Identity. 
More  typically,  the  set S  is deﬁned  in  terms of  simple  sequences or  sets  rather  than an  elaborate 
story. Here is less­colorful example of a combinatorial argument.

Proof.  We  give  a  combinatorial  proof.  Let  S  be  all  n­card  hands  that  can  be  dealt  from  a  deck 
� �3n  
containing  n  red  cards  (numbered  1, . . . , n)  and  2n   black  cards  (numbered  1, . . . , 2n).  First,  note 
that every 3n­element set has

From another perspective, the number of hands with exactly r red cards is

Combinatorial proofs are almost magical. Theorem 6.1 looks pretty scary, but we proved it without 
� � 
any algebraic manipulations at all.  The key to constructing a combinatorial proof is choosing the 
set  S  properly,  which  can  be  tricky.  Generally,  the  simpler  side  of  the  equation  should  provide 
some guidance.  For example, the right side of Theorem 6.1 is  3
n  , which suggests choosing S to 
n
be all n­element subsets of some 3n­element set.
