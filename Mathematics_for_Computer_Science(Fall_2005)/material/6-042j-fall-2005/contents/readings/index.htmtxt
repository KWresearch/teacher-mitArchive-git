The course notes below form the "textbook" for the course. Each week, students
are required to read the relevant notes, answer questions about these notes
assigned on an Online Tutor, and email to the instructor comments on a passage
from the reading that was difficult, surprising, or should be more thoroughly
explained. Prof. Albert Meyer attempts to adapt lectures in response to student
email on the reading.
