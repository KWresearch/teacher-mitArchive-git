Fallacies  with  Inﬁnity 

­David  Shin 

Consider  the  following  claim: 

Claim  1.  There  exists  an  inﬁnite  decreasing  sequence  of  natural  numbers. 

Proof.  Assume  for  sake  of  contradiction  that  the  longest  decreasing  sequence  of  natural  numbers  is  ﬁnite. 
Let  S  =  {a1 , a2 , . . . , an }  be  such  a  sequence.  Then,  choose  some  a0  larger  than  maxi ai ,  and  note  that 
S �  =  {a0 , a1 , a2 , . . . , an }  forms  a  length­(n + 1)  decreasing  sequence.  This  contradicts  the  maximality  of  S , 
and  hence  completes  the  proof. 

Clearly,  there  must  be  something  wrong  with  this  proof,  since  there  is  no  inﬁnite  decreasing  sequence  of 
natural  numbers !  What  is  the  error? 

The  error  lies  in  the  ﬁrst  sentence  of  the  proof:  one  is  not  allowed  to  assume  that  a  longest  decreasing 
sequence  exists.  In  fact,  in  this  case,  a  longest  decreasing  sequence  does  not  exist.  The  Well  Ordering 
Principle  only  allows  us  to  assume  that  a  shortest  decreasing  sequence  exists. 

A  few  students  attempted  proofs  similar  to  this  one  for  parts  (a)  and  (b)  of  problem  3  of  Problem  Set  3. 
These  solutions  were  not  valid. 

For  completeness,  let  us  look  at  another  common  error  with  inﬁnity.  We  give  another  “proof ”  of  Claim  1. 

Proof.  Let  P (n)  be  the  statement,  “There  exists  a  decreasing  length­n  sequence  of  natural  numbers.” 

We prove  that P (n) holds  for all n by  induction.  The base  case P (1),  is  clear,  as we  can  just  take  the  single­
element  sequence  {1}.  For  the  inductive  step,  suppose  that  P (n)  holds,  and  let  {a1 , a2 , . . . , an }  be  a  corre­
sponding  decreasing  sequence.  Then,  choose  some  a0  larger  than  maxi ai ,  and  note  that  {a0 , a1 , a2 , . . . , an }
forms  a  length­(n + 1)  decreasing  sequence.  This  demonstrates P (n + 1)  and  hence  completes  the  proof. 

What  is  wrong  with  this  proof ?  This  proof  demonstrates  the  common  error  of  “inﬁnite  induction”.  It  is 
tempting  to  say  that  if  P (1)  holds  and  if  P (n) →  P (n + 1)  for  all  n  ∈  N,  then  P (∞)  holds.  However,  the 
principle  of  induction  does  not  guarantee  this.  It  only  guarantees  that  P (n)  holds  for  all  n ∈ N.  In  fact,  the 
statement  P (∞)  is  not  always  well­deﬁned! 

Moral  of  the  story:  Be  very  careful  when  dealing  with  inﬁnity!  When  in  doubt,  run  the  proof  by  a 
TA  or  by  your  friend  that  has  taken  18.100B.
