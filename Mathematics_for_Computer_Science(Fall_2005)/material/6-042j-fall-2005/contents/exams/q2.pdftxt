Problem 6 (25 points).  We will describe a process that operates on sequences of numbers. 
The process will start with a sequence that is some permutation of the length 4n sequence 

(1, 2, . . . , n, 1, 2, . . . , n, 1, 2, . . . , 2n). 

(a)  (7 points) Write a simple formula for the number of possible starting sequences. 

If (s1 , . . . , sk ) is a sequence of numbers, then the i and j th elements of the sequence are out 
of order if the number on the left is strictly larger the number on the right, that is, if i < j 
and si  > sj .  Otherwise,  the ith and j th elements are  in order.  Deﬁne p(S )::=  the number 
of “out­of­order ” pairs of elements in a sequence, S . 
For example, if S is the sequence 

(3, 4, 2, 1, 7, 3), 
then the 1st and 3rd elements of S , (namely, 3 and 2), are out of order, but the 3rd and 6th 
elements (2 and 3) are in order. The 1st and 6th elements of S are also in order, since they 
are both 3.  In this case, p(S )  = 7. 
The reversal of (s1 , . . . , sk ) is (sk , . . . , s1 ).  So the reversal of the sequence S is 

(3, 7, 1, 2, 4, 3). 

From the starting sequence, we carry out the following process:

(*) Pick two consecutive elements in the current sequence, say the ith and (i +  1)st.


I.  If  the  elements  are not  in order,  then  switch  them  in  the  sequence  and  repeat  step 
(*). 

II.  If  the  elements  are  in  order,  remove  both,  resulting  in  a  sequence  that  is  shorter 
by  two.  If  the  length  of  the  resulting  sequence  is  zero  or  one,  the  process  is  over. 
Otherwise, reverse the sequence and repeat step (*). 

This process can be modelled as a state machine where  the  states are  the sequences  that 
appear at step (*). We then consider the derived variables on the following page:

i.  p(S ) 

ii.  length  (S )  rem  2  

iii.  length  (S ) +  p(S ) 

iv.  max  (p(S ),  8n ) 
2
v.  4n2  · length  (S ) +  p(S ) 

(b)  (14  points)  Indicate  next  to  each  of  the  derived  variables  above which  one  of  these 
properties it has: 

C 
constant 
SI 
strictly increasing 
strictly decreasing 
SD 
weakly increasing but not constant  WI 
weakly decreasing but not constant  WD 
N 
none of the above 

(c)  (2 points) Which of the variable behaviors in i.–v. above immediately implies that the 
process will deﬁnitely terminate? 

(d)  (2  points) Which  of  the  variable  behaviors  in  i.–v.  above  immediately  implies  that, 
starting  from any of  the possible starting states  from part  (a),  the process will not  termi­
nate with a length 1 sequence?
