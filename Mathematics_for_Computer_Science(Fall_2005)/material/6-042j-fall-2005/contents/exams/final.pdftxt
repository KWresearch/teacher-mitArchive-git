Problem 2 (20 points).  State Machines 
We will describe a process that operates on sequences of numbers.  The process will start 
with a sequence that is some permutation of the length 6n sequence 

(1, 2, . . . , n, 1, 2, . . . , 2n, 1, 2, . . . , 3n). 

(a)  (5 points) Write a simple formula for the number of possible starting sequences. 

If (s1 , . . . , sk ) is a sequence of numbers, then the i and j th elements of the sequence are out 
of order if the number on the left is strictly larger the number on the right, that is, if i < j 
and si  > sj .  Otherwise,  the ith and j th elements are  in order.  Deﬁne p(S )::=  the number 
of “out­of­order ” pairs of elements in a sequence, S . 
From the starting sequence, we carry out the following process: 
(*) Pick two consecutive elements in the current sequence, say the ith and (i +  1)st. 

I.  If  the  elements  are not  in order,  then  switch  them  in  the  sequence  and  repeat  step 
(*). 

II.  If the elements are in order, remove both, resulting in a sequence that is shorter by 
two.  Then pick another element and remove it as well.  If the length of the resulting 
sequence  is  less  than  three,  the  process  is  over.  Otherwise,  reverse  the  sequence 
and repeat step (*). 

This process can be modelled as a state machine where  the  states are  the sequences  that 
appear at step (*).

(b)  (5 points) Describe a  simple  state  invariant predicate  that  immediately  implies  that 
if  this  process  halts,  then  the  ﬁnal  state  is  the  sequence  of  length  zero.  (Just  deﬁne  the 
invariant; you need not prove it has the requisite properties.) 

(c)  (10 points) Prove that this process always terminates by deﬁning a nonnegative inte­
ger valued derived variable that is strictly decreasing.  (Just deﬁne the variable, you need 
not prove it has these properties.)

Problem 5 (15 points).  Inclusion­exclusion 
A certain company wants to have security for their computer systems. So they have given 
everyone a name and password. A length 10 word containing each of the characters: 

a, d, e, f, i, l, o, p, r, s, 

is called a cword. A password will be a cword which does not contain any of the subwords 
”fails”, ”failed”, or ”drop”. 
Use  the  Inclusion­exclusion  Principle  to  ﬁnd  a  simple  formula  for  the  number  of  pass­
words.

(a)  (5  points)  Seashells  are  used  for  currency  on  a  remote  island.  However,  there  are 
only huge shells worth 210   dollars and gigantic shells worth 312  dollars.  Suppose islander 
A owes  m > 0  dollars  to  islander  B .  Explain  why  the  debt  can  be  repaid  through  an 
exchange of shells provided A and B both have enough of each kind.

Problem 9 (15 points).  Conditional Probability 
There are 3 children of different ages.  What  is  the probability  that at  least  two are boys, 
given that at least one of the two youngest children is a boy? 
Assume  that  each  child  is  equally  likely  to  be  a  boy  or  a  girl  and  that  their  genders  are 
mutually  independent.  A  correct  answer  alone  is  sufﬁcient.  However,  to  be  eligible  for 
partial credit, you must include a clearly­labeled tree diagram.

Problem 10 (15 points).  Probability and Expectation 
A box initially contains n  balls, all colored black. A ball is drawn from the box at random. 

•	 If  the  drawn  ball  is  black,  then  a  biased  coin  with  probability,  p  >  0,  of  coming 
up  heads  is  ﬂipped.  If  the  coin  comes  up  heads,  a  white  ball  is  put  into  the  box; 
otherwise the black ball is returned to the box. 

•	 If the drawn ball is white, then it is returned to the box. 

This process is repeated until the box contains n  white balls. 
Let D  be the number of balls drawn until the process ends with the box full of white balls. 
Prove that E [D] =  nHn/p, where Hn  is the nth Harmonic number. 
Hint:  Let  Di  be  the  number  of  draws  after  the  ith  white  ball  until  the  draw  when  the 
(i  +  1)st white ball is put into the box.

Problem 11 (15 points).  Deviation from the Mean 
I  have  a  randomized  algorithm  for  calculating  6.042  grades  that  seems  to  have  very 
strange  behavior.  For  example,  if  I  run  it  more  than  once  on  the  same  data,  it  has  dif­
ferent running times. However, one thing I know for sure is that its expected running time 
is 10  seconds. 

(a)  (5 points) What does Markov’s bound tell us about the probablity that my algorithm 
takes longer than 1 minute (=  60  seconds)? 

(b)  (5  points)  Suppose  I  decide  to  run  the  algorithm  for  1 minute  and  if  I  don’t  get  an 
answer by  that  time,  I  stop what  I  am doing,  and  completely  restart  from  scratch.  Each 
time that I stop and restart the algorithm gives me an independent run of the algorithm. 
So,  what  is  an  upper  bound  on  the  probability  that  my  algorithm  takes  longer  than  5 
minutes to get an answer? 

(c)  (5 points) Suppose some 6.042 student  tells me  that  they determined  the variance of 
the running time of my algorithm, and it is 25. What is an upper bound on the probability 
that my algorithm takes longer than 1 minute?

Problem 12 (20 points).  Estimation and Conﬁdence 
On December 20, 2005, the MIT fabrication facility produced a long run of silicon wafers. 
To  estimate  the  fraction,  d,  of  defective  wafers  in  this  run,  we  will  take  a  sample  of  n 
independent random choices of wafers  from  the run,  test  them  for defects, and estimate 
that d is approximately the same as the fraction of defective wafers in the sample. 
A calculation based on  the Binomial Sampling Theorem  (given below) will yield a near­
minimal number,  n0 ,  and  such  that with  a  sample of  size n  =  n0 ,  the  estimated  fraction 
will be within 0.006 of the actual fraction, d, with 97% conﬁdence.

(b)  (10 points) The calculations in part (a) depend on some facts about the run and how 
the  n wafers  in  the  sample  are  chosen.  Write  T  or  F  next  to  each  of  the  following  state­

The probability that the ninth wafer in the sample is defective is d. 
The probability that the ninth wafer in the run is defective is d. 
All wafers in the run are equally likely to be selected as the third wafer in the 
sample. 
The expectation of the indicator variable for the last wafer in the sample being 
defective is d. 
Given  that  the  ﬁrst wafer  in  the  sample  is  defective,  the  probability  that  the 
second wafer will also be defective is less than than d. 
Given that the last wafer in the run is defective, the probability that the next­
to­last wafer in the run will also be defective is less than than d. 
It turns out that there are several different colors of wafer. Given that the ﬁrst 
two  wafers  in  the  sample  are  the  same  color,  the  probability  that  the  ﬁrst  wafer  is 
defective may be < d. 
The probability that all the wafers in the sample will be different is nonzero. 
The probability  that all  choices of wafers  in  the  sample will be different de­
pends on the length of the run. 
The  probability  that  all  choices  of  wafers  in  the  sample  will  be  different  is
