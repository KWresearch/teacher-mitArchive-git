•	 This quiz  is  closed book.  There  is  an Appendix giving  the deﬁnitions of  standard 
properties of relations. 
•	 There  are  four  (4)  problems  totaling  100  points.  Problems  are  labeled  with  their 
point values. 
•	 Put your name on the top of every page – these pages may be separated for grading. 
•	 Write  your  solutions  in  the  space  provided.  If  you  need more  space,  write  on  the 
back of the sheet containing the problem. Please keep your entire answer to a prob­
lem on that problem’s page. 
•	 You may assume any of the results presented in class or in the lecture notes. 
•	 Be neat and write  legibly.  You will be graded not only on  the correctness of your 
answer, but also on the clarity with which you express it.

GOOD LUCK!

Problem 1 (25 points).  Consider the following system speciﬁcations1 . 

1.  The system is in multiuser state iff it is operating normally. 

2.  If the system is operating normally, then the kernel is functioning. 

3.  The kernel is not functioning or the system is in interrupt mode. 

4.  If the system is not in multiuser state, then it is in interrupt mode. 

5.  The system is not in interrupt mode. 

(a)  (0 points)  To make sense of these confusing conditions, let’s introduce four Boolean 
variables. 

(1) 
in Multiuser state 
::= 
M 
(2) 
::=  operating Normally 
N 
(3) 
::=  Kernel is functioning 
K 
(4) 
in Interrupt mode 
::= 
I 
Translate the ﬁve statements in the speciﬁcation into propositional logic notation: ∧ , ∨ , ¬ , −→

Problem 2 (20 points).  For  each  of  the  following  logical  formulas  with  domain  of  dis­
course the natural numbers, N, indicate whether it is a possible formulation of 

I:  the Induction Axiom, 

S:  the Strong Induction Axiom, 

L:  the Least Number Principle (also known as Well­ordering), or 

N:  None of these. 

For example, the ordinary Induction Axiom could be expressed by the following formula, 
so it gets labelled “I”. 
(P (0) ∧ [∀ k P (k) −→ P (k + 1)]) −→ ∀ k P (k)

This is a multiple choice problem: do not explain your answer. 
(a)  (0 points)  (P (b) ∧ [∀ k ≥ b P (k) −→ P (k + 1)]) −→ ∀ k ≥ b P (k) 
(b)  (0 points)  (P (b) ∧ [∀ k ≤ b P (k) −→ P (k + 1)]) −→ ∀ k ≤ b P (k) 
[∀ b (∀ k < b P (k)) −→ P (b)] −→ ∀ k P (k) 
(c)  (0 points) 
(d)  (0 points)  (∃ n P (n)) −→ ∃ n ∀ k < n P (k) 
(e)  (0 points)  ∀ n [P (n) −→ (∃ n P (n) ∧ ∀ k < n P (k))] 

Problem 3 (20 points).  Classify each of the following binary relations as 

E:  An equivalence relation. 

T:  A Total order, 

P:  A Partial order that is not total. 

S:  A Symmetric relation that is not transitive. 

N:  None of the above. 

This is a multiple choice problem: do not explain your answer. 

(a)  (0  points)  The  relation  xRy  between  times  of  day  such  that  x and  y  are  at  most 
twenty minutes apart.

(b)  (0 points)  The relation xRy  between times of day such that x  is more than twenty 
minutes later than y . 

(c)  (0  points)  The  relation  xRy  over  all  words  in  this  sentence  such  that  x  does  not 
appear after y .  (Consider “x”, “y”, and “xRy” to be words.) 

(d)  (0 points)  The  relation xRy  over all words  in  this  sentence such  that word x does 
not appear after word y . 

(e)  (0 points)  The  relation xRy  over  all words  in  this  sentence  such  that  the ﬁnal  ap­
pearance of y occurs after x. 

Problem 4 (35 points).  To  encourage  collaborative  study,  the  6.042  staff  is  considering 
assigning each student  to a study group with  two or  three other students.  Prove  that as 
long  as  the  enrollment  is  large  enough,  the  class  can  always  be divided  into  such  study 
groups.

A binary relation, R, on a set A is 
•  reﬂexive iff xRx, 
•  symmetric iff xRy −→ yRx, 
•  anti­symmetric iff xRy ∧ yRx −→ x = y , 
•  transitive iff xRy ∧ yRz  −→ xRz , 
for all x, y , z  ∈ A. 
•  R is an equivalence relation iff it is reﬂexive, symmetric and transitive. 
•  R is a partial order iff it is transitive and anti­symmetric. 
•  R is a total order iff it is a partial order and for all x = y ∈ A either xRy or yRx.
