Problem  1  (15  points).  Let  G  be  an  undirected  graph.  Let  P (x,  y)  mean  that  there  is  a 
path  from  vertex  x  to  vertex  y .  Express  each  of  the  following  sentences  in  terms  of  P , 
quantiﬁers, logical connectives, and equality, using variables that range over the vertices 
of G.  (Reminder:  there is a zero­length path from any vertex to itself.) 

(a)  (3 points) Vertices x  and y  are in the same connected component. 

(b)  (3  points) G  has  a  vertex  of  degree  zero.  (Reminder:  undirected  graphs  only  have 
edges between distinct vertices, that is, no self­loops.) 

(c)  (4 points) G  has at least three connected components. 

(d)  (5 points) There is a positive­length simple path from x  to y .

Problem 2 (10 points).  Classify each of the following binary relations as 

E:  An equivalence relation. 

T:  A Total order, 

P:  A Partial order that is not total. 

S:  A Symmetric relation that is not transitive. 

N:  None of the above. 

(a)  (2 points) The relation between times during a single day: x  and y  are at most twenty 
minutes apart. 

(b)  (2  points)  The  relation  between  times  during  a  single  day:  x  is  more  than  twenty 
minutes later than y . 

(c)  (2 points) The relation between vertices in an arbitrary digraph:  there is a path from 
v  to w . 

(d)  (2 points) The relation between vertices in an undirected graph:  there is a path from 
v  to w . 

(e)  (2  points)  The  relation  between  Fall  ’05  6.042  students:  student  s  is  older  but  also 
shorter than t.

Problem  4  (20  points).  An  intersection  graph  is  an  undirected  graph  whose  vertices  are 
sets  and whose  edges  are  speciﬁed  by  the  rule  that  there  is  an  edge  between  vertices A 
and B  iff A  =  B  and A  ∩ B  =  ∅. 

(a)  (1 point) Draw the intersection graph whose vertices are the sets 
{1,   2,   3} ,  {1,   9,   10} ,  {2,  4,  6,  8,  10} ,  {3,  4,  5} ,  {5,  6,  7} ,  {7,  8,  9} 

(b)  (3 points) What is the chromatic number of the graph in part (a)? 

(c)  (3 points) What is the largest k  such that the graph in part (a) is k ­connected? 

We now consider an arbitrary undirected graph, G.  For any vertex, v , of G, let I (v) be the 
set of edges incident to v . 

(d)  (3  points)  Explain  how  to  uniquely  determine  the  vertex  v  given  any  two  edges  in 
I (v).

(e)  (10 points) An  incidence­set  is  the  set  of  edges  incident  to  some  vertex,  that  is,  a  set 
equal  to  I (v)  for  some  vertex  v  of G.  Prove  that  if G  is  a  graph whose  vertices  all  have 
degree greater  than  1,  then  the  function,  I ,  is  an  isomorphism between G  and  the  inter­
section graph whose vertices are the incidence­sets of G.

Problem 5 (10 points).  Two banks only allow transactions that are multiples of 39  dollars 
or  57  dollars.  Is  there  a  series  of  transactions  whose  net  result  is  a  payment  of  1  dollar 
from the ﬁrst bank to the second bank? Brieﬂy explain why or why not. 

Problem 6  (15 points).  Each year,  Santa’s  reindeer hold “Reindeer Games”,  from which 
Rudolph is pointedly excluded.  The Games consist of a sequence of matches, where one 
reindeer competes against another. Draws are not possible. 
On Christmas Eve, Santa produces a rank list of all his reindeer.  If reindeer p  lost a match 
to reindeer q , then p  appears below q  in Santa’s ranking, but if he has any choice because 
of unplayed matches, Santa can give higher rank to the reindeer he likes better. To prevent 
confusion, two reindeer may not play a match if either outcome would lead to a cycle of 
reindeer, where each lost to the next. 
Though it is only October, the 2004 Reindeer Games have already begun. We can describe 
the  results  so  far with  a binary  relation,  L,  on  the  set of  reindeer, where  pLq  means  that 
reindeer  p  lost  a match  to  reindeer  q .  Let  L+  be  the  corresponding  positive­length  path 
relation1 . Note that L+  is a partial order, so we can regard a match loser as “smaller ” than 
the winner. 

On  the  following page you’ll ﬁnd a  list of  terms and a  sequence of  statements.  Add  the 
appropriate term to each statement. 

1Thus, reindeer p  is related to reindeer q  by L+  if p  lost to q  or if p  lost to a reindeer who lost to q  or if p 
lost to a reindeer who lost to a reindeer who lost to q , etc.

Problem 7 (10 points).  A map is a connected planar graph with a planar drawing whose 
face boundaries are simple cycles. 

(a)  (7 points) Prove that if a map has no simple cycle of length 3, then
