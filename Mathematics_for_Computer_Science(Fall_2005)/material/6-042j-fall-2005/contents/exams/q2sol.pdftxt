(e)  (2 points) The  security  of RSA  relies  on  the  assumption  that  the  ability  to decipher 
RSA­encrypted messages efﬁciently would imply the ability to factor key­sized numbers 
efﬁciently. 

True 

False 

Solution.  The correct answer is F. The security of RSA is shakier than the presumed dif­
ﬁcultly of factoring, as noted in a pset. Very few students got this right, and since we did 
not adequately deﬁne what security formally means, we awarded 2 points to everyone.� 

Problem 2 (20 points).  (a)  (10 points) Using the Pulverizer, ﬁnd an x in the range [0  . . . 99] 
such that x is an inverse of 19 modulo 100. 

Solution.  There are two valid approaches. Solution 1: Use the Pulverizer to ﬁnd integers 
s, t such that s19   + t100   = 1. Then s  rem  100  will be 19−1 .  In this case the Pulverizer yields 
21  ≡ 79  (mod  100).  Solution 2:  Find k =  φ(100), so by 
−21  · 19  +   4   · 100  = 1, so 19−1 
≡ −
Euler ’s Theorem,  19−1  ≡ 19k−1  (mod   100).  Then 19k−1  rem  100  will be 19−1  .  This can be 
computed by at most �log  100� = 6  squarings modulo 100.

Solution.  Note that 360   = 23  32  5.  It follows that φ(360)  = 4  6  4  = 96. 

�

(c)  (5 points) What is the value of 798  rem  360? 
Solution.  Since 7 and 360 are relatively prime, we have by Euler ’s Theorem that 796  ≡ 1 
(mod  360), and so 
798   =  796   · 72  ≡ 1  · 49  ≡ 49 

(mod  360).

f6 (n)  = 2   +  sin   n

f1 (n) =  log(n!) 
f5 (n) =  log(nn )

(a)  (6 points) The number of rearrangements of the word BAZOOKA  in which the two 
O’s do not appear next to each other.

Solution.  Total number of arrangements is: 
7 
2, 2, 1, 1, 1 
The  number  of  arrangements  in  which  the  two  O’s  do  appear  next  to  each  other  is  the

number of rearrangements of BAZOKA since we can treat the double­O as though it was

=  1260.  

(b)  (6 points) The number of rearrangements of the word BAZOOKA  in which the two 
O’s do not appear next to each other and that do not start with B .

Solution.  Total number of arrangements that do start with B is the number of rearrange­
ments of AZOOKA:

6! 
= 
2, 2, 1, 1 
2!  2! 
Number of arrangements starting with B and with two O’s next to each other is the num­

ber of arrangements of AZOKA:

2, 1, 1, 1 

5! 
=  = 60. 
2! 

=  180.  

By  inclusion­exclusion  it  follows  that  the number of arrangements  in which  the  two O’s 
appear  together  or  that  start  with  B  is  the  number  that  have  two  O’s  together  plus  the 
number that start with B, minus the number that do both: 
360  +  180  − 60  =  480. 

(2) 

So the number that neither have two O’s next to each other nor start with B is the total (1) 
minus those that do one or the other  (2), namely 
1260  − 480  = 780.

(d)  (6 points) The number of positive integer solutions to the inequality: 
x1  +  x2  +  .  .  .  +  x10  ≤ 100. 
Solution.  There is an immediate bijection between the number of positive solutions to the 
above inequality: 
x1  +  x2  +  .  .  .  +  x10  ≤ 100, 
and the number of solutions to the equality

Problem 5 (10 points).  To prove that n =  O( 
i3 ) we can use the integral method to

i=1 
bound the sum.  In particular, we should obtain a(n)

(CIRCLE THE RIGHT CHOICE) 
bound on the sum that is equal to the value of  a  (x +  c)ddx where 

upper

a is 

, 

b is 

, 

c is 

, and 

d is 

. 

Solution.  The  sum  must  be  greater  than  �n4  for  some  positive  �  in  order  for  n4  to  be 
O(the  sum).  That  is,  we  need  such  a  lower  bound  on  the  sum.  To  do  this,  we  choose 
the  constants  so  that  integral  is  ≤  the  sum,  and  is  also  >  �n4  .  Choosing  d  = 3,  and 
a = 0, b =  n, c = 0, for example, will do the job.  It would also be OK to increase this value 
for  a  by  a  constant  (say  a  = 1),  and  decrease  c  by  the  same  constant  (say  c  =  −1),  and 
decrease the value of b by a constant (say b =  n − 2).

Problem 6 (25 points).  We will describe a process that operates on sequences of numbers. 
The process will start with a sequence that is some permutation of the length 4n sequence 

(1, 2, . . . , n, 1, 2, . . . , n, 1, 2, . . . , 2n).

Solution.  Using  the  Bookkeeper  rule:  4n  digits  can  be  arranged  in  4n!  ways;  each  digit 
from  1  to  n  appears  3  times.  Therefore,  we  have  to  divide  4n!  by  3!  . . . 3!,  n  times.  The 
answer is: 

(4n)!  
(3!)n

If (s1 , . . . , sk ) is a sequence of numbers, then the i and j th elements of the sequence are out 
of order if the number on the left is strictly larger the number on the right, that is, if i < j 
and si  > sj .  Otherwise,  the ith and j th elements are  in order.  Deﬁne p(S )::=  the number 
of “out­of­order ” pairs of elements in a sequence, S .  For example, if S is the sequence 

(3, 4, 2, 1, 7, 3), 

then the 1st and 3rd elements of S , (namely, 3 and 2), are out of order, but the 3rd and 6th 
elements (2 and 3) are in order. The 1st and 6th elements of S are also in order, since they 
are both 3.  In this case, p(S )  = 7.  The reversal of (s1 , . . . , sk ) is (sk , . . . , s1 ).  So the reversal 
of the sequence S is 

(3, 7, 1, 2, 4, 3). 
From the starting sequence, we carry out the following process:  (*) Pick two consecutive 
elements in the current sequence, say the ith and (i +  1)st. 

I.  If  the  elements  are not  in order,  then  switch  them  in  the  sequence  and  repeat  step 
(*). 

II.  If  the  elements  are  in  order,  remove  both,  resulting  in  a  sequence  that  is  shorter 
by  two.  If  the  length  of  the  resulting  sequence  is  zero  or  one,  the  process  is  over. 
Otherwise, reverse the sequence and repeat step (*). 

This process can be modelled as a state machine where  the  states are  the sequences  that 
appear at step (*). We then consider the derived variables on the following page: 

i.  p(S ) 

Solution.  None  of  the Above.  (2  pts)  Reversing  a  sequence maps  an  out­of­order 
pairs  of  elements  into  an  in  order  pair  of  elements  with  different  values.  Pairs  of 
elements with  the  same  values  stay  in  order.  So  the  number  of  out  of  order  pairs 
can  increase  or decrease depending on whether  there were more out­of­order  than 
� 
strictly in order pairs. 

ii.  length  (S )  rem  2  

Solution.  Constant.  (2 pts)  length  (S )  changes by 0 or 2 at each transition,  it parity

is unchanged.

iv.  max  (p(S ), 8n2 ) 

Solution.  None  of  the  Above.  (3  pts)  While  length  (S )  decreases  by  2  or  is  un­
� 
changed, p(S ) may go up or down by more than 2. 
� � 
4n 
Solution.  Constant.  (3 pts) Since there are only

< 8n2  pairs of distinct positions 
2
in a length 4n sequence, at most this many can be out of order (even fewer because 
there will be 3  pairs of elements with the same value for each of the values 1, . . . , n) 
and p(n) ≤ the total number of such pairs. 
� 
v.  4n2  · length  (S ) +  p(S ) 
Solution.  Strictly  Decreasing.  (4  pts)  In  the  ﬁrst  transition,  p(S )  decreases  and 
� � 
length  (S )  stays  the  same.  The  quantity  decreases.  In  the  second  transition,  the 
4n2  length  (S )  decreases  by  8n .  But  p(S )  can’t  change  by more  than  its maximum 
2
value, which by the previous part is ≤
n

< 8n2 .  So the quantity decreases in this

case too.

nate with a length 1 sequence? 

Solution.  ii.  Since  every  possible  start  state  has  length  4n,  Fact  ii.  implies  that  every
