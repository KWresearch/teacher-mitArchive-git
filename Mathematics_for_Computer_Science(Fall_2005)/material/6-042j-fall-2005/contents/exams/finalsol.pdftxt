Solutions to the Final Examination 

Problem 1 (15 points).  Induction 
Suppose S (n) is a predicate on natural numbers, n, and suppose 
∀ k ∈ N S (k)  −→ S (k +  2). 

(1) 

If  (1)  holds,  some  of  the  assertions  below  must  always  (A)  hold,  some  can  (C)  hold  but 
not  always,  and  some  can  never  (N)  hold.  Indicate  which  case  applies  for  each  of  the 
assertions by circling the correct letter. 

(a)  (3 points)  A  N  C 

(∀ n ≤ 100  S (n))  ∧ (∀ n > 100  ¬ S (n)) 
Solution.  N. In this case, S is true for n up to 100 and false from 101 on.  So S (99)  is true, 
�−→ S (k +  2)   for k = 99.  This case is impossible. 
but S (101)  is false.  That means that S (k)

(b)  (3 points)  A  N  C 

S (1)  −→ ∀ n S (2n +  1)  
Solution.  A. This assertion says that if S (1) holds, then S (n) holds for all odd n. This case 
� 
is always true. 

(c)  (3 points)  A  N  C 

[∃ n S (2n)]   −→ ∀ n S (2n +  2)  
Solution.  C. If S (n) is always true, this assertion holds.  So 
this  case  is  possible.  If  S (n)  is  true  only  for  even  n greater  than  4,  (1)  holds,  but  this 
� 
assertion is false.  So this case does not always hold.

Solution.  N. This assertion says that S holds for some even number ,2n, but not for some 
other larger even number, 2m.  However, if S (2n) holds, we can apply (1) n − m times to 
� 
conclude S (2m) also holds. This case is impossible. 

(e)  (3 points)  A  N  C 

[∃ n S (n)]  −→ ∀ n ∃ m > n S (m) 
Solution.  A. This assertion says that if S holds for some n,  then for every number,  there 
is a  larger number, m,  for which S also holds.  Since  (1)  implies  that  if  there  is one n for 
which S (n)  holds,  there are an  inﬁnite,  increasing chain of k ’s for which S (k)  holds,  this 
� 
case is always true. 

Problem 2 (20 points).  State Machines 
We will describe a process that operates on sequences of numbers.  The process will start 
with a sequence that is some permutation of the length 6n sequence 

(1, 2, . . . , n, 1, 2, . . . , 2n, 1, 2, . . . , 3n). 

(a)  (5 points) Write a simple formula for the number of possible starting sequences. 

Solution.  Using the Bookkeeper rule: There are 6n occurrences of digits, where each digit 
from 1  to n appears 3 times, and each digit from n +  1  to 2n appears twice, and each digit 
from 2n +  1   to 3n appears once, so the number of possible starting sequences is 

(6n)!  
(3!)n (2!)n 

= 

(6n)! 
12n 

. 

� 

If (s1 , . . . , sk ) is a sequence of numbers, then the i and j th elements of the sequence are out 
of order if the number on the left is strictly larger the number on the right, that is, if i < j 
and si  > sj .  Otherwise,  the ith and j th elements are  in order.  Deﬁne p(S )::=  the number 
of “out­of­order ” pairs of elements in a sequence, S . 
From the starting sequence, we carry out the following process: 
(*) Pick two consecutive elements in the current sequence, say the ith and (i +  1)st. 

I.  If  the  elements  are not  in order,  then  switch  them  in  the  sequence  and  repeat  step 
(*).

II.  If the elements are in order, remove both, resulting in a sequence that is shorter by

two.  Then pick another element and remove it as well.  If the length of the resulting

sequence  is  less  than  three,  the  process  is  over.  Otherwise,  reverse  the  sequence 

and repeat step (*).


This process can be modelled as a state machine where  the  states are  the sequences  that 
appear at step (*). 

(b)  (5 points) Describe a  simple  state  invariant predicate  that  immediately  implies  that 
if  this  process  halts,  then  the  ﬁnal  state  is  the  sequence  of  length  zero.  (Just  deﬁne  the 
invariant; you need not prove it has the requisite properties.) 
Solution.  The predicate 3  |  length  (S )  is an  invariant of  states, S ,  and  is  true of  the  start 
state, so is also true of the ﬁnal state, so the length of the ﬁnal state cannot be 1 or 2.  � 

(c)  (10 points) Prove that this process always terminates by deﬁning a nonnegative inte­
ger valued derived variable that is strictly decreasing.  (Just deﬁne the variable, you need 
not prove it has these properties.) 
Solution.  6n · length  (S ) +  p(S ) as in the solution to Quiz 2, Problem 4.

Problem 3 (15 points).  Equivalence Relations and Random Variables 
A random variable, X  is said to match a random variable, Y  , iff X  and Y  are on the same 
sample space and Pr {X  =  Y  } = 0. Prove that “matches” is an equivalence relation. Hint: 
Note that Pr {X  =  Z } =  Pr {[X  =  Z ]
[X  =  Y  ]} +  Pr {[X  =  Z ]
∩
[X  =  Y  ]}.
∩
Solution.  Since Pr {X  =  X } = 0, “matches” is reﬂexive. Also, since Pr {X  =  Y  } =  Pr {Y  =  X }, 
“matches” is symmetric.

To prove transitivity suppose X  matches Y  and Y  matches Z .

Now we use  the hint.  (The hint  itself  follows  from  the  fact  that  the  event  [X  =�
disjoint union of the events [X   =  Z ] ∩ [X  =  Y  ] and [X  =  Z ] ∩ [X  =  Y  ].) Also, 

⊆
∩

z ]  is  the


[X  =  Y  ],

[X  =  Z ]

[X  =  Y  ]

and 

so 

[X  =  Z ]

∩

[X  =  Y  ]

⊆

[Y   =  Z ],

Pr {[X  =  Z ]} ≤ Pr {[X  =  Y  ]} +  Pr {[Y  =  Z ]} .

So if X  matches Y  and Y  matches Z , then the righthand side of (2) is 0, and so X  matches 
Z , which proves transivity. 
An alternative proof of  transitivity  (not using  the hint), uses  the  fact  that  if X (s) =� Z (s) 
at some sample point, s, then either X (s) =� Y  (s) or Y  (s) =  Z (s). But if X (s) =  Y  (s), then 
� 
�� 
Pr {s} = 0, since X  matches Y  .  Similarly, if Y  (s) =  Z (s), then Pr {s} = 0, since Y  matches 
Z .  So in any case, Pr {s} = 0.  So Pr {X  =  Z } = 
Pr {s} = 
0 = 0, that is, 
s∈[X=Z ] 
s∈[X=Z ]

X  matches Z . 

Problem 4 (15 points).  Planarity. 

(a)  (8 points) Exhibit two planar drawings of the same 5­vertex graph in which a face in 
one drawing has more edges than any face in the other drawing. 

Solution.  One  drawing  is  a  triangle  with  external  triangles  sitting  on  two  of  its  edges; 
the four faces are of sizes 3,3,3,5.  The other drawing is gotten ﬂipping one of the external 
� 
triangles to be internal; the four faces are now of sizes 3,3,4,4. 

(b)  (7 points) Prove  that all planar drawings of  the  same graph have  the  same number 
of faces. 
Solution.  We know that for any connected graph, f  =  e  +  v  − 2  by Euler ’s formula.  Since 
e  and v  are uniquely determined by the graph, f  must also be determined. 
For a general graph, we use the generalization of Euler ’s formula: f  + c  =  e + v  − 1, where 
c  is the number of connected components of the graph. An analogous argument works. 
� 
No points were deducted for neglecting the general case. 

Problem 5 (15 points).  Inclusion­exclusion 
A certain company wants to have security for their computer systems. So they have given 
everyone a name and password. A length 10 word containing each of the characters: 

a, d, e, f, i, l, o, p, r, s,

is called a cword. A password will be a cword which does not contain any of the subwords 
”fails”, ”failed”, or ”drop”. 
Use  the  Inclusion­exclusion  Principle  to  ﬁnd  a  simple  formula  for  the  number  of  pass­
words. 
Solution.  There  are  7!   cwords  that  contain  “drop”,  6!  that  contain  “fails”,  and  5!  that 
contain “failed”.  There are 3!   cwords containing both “drop” and “fails”.  No cword can 
contain both “fails” and “failed”.  The cwords containing both “drop” and “failed” come 
from  taking  the  subword “failedrop” and  the  remaining  letter “s”  in any order,  so  there 
are  2!  of  them.  So  by  Inclusion­exclusion, we  have  the  number  of  cwords  containing  at 
least one of the three forbidden subwords is 
(7!   +  6!  +  5!)  − (3!  +  0  +  2!)  +  0  =  5!(48)   − 8. 
Among the 10!  cwords, the remaining ones are passwords, so the number of passwords is 
10!  − 5!(48)  +  8  = 3,  623,  048.

Problem 6 (15 points).  Number Theory and Induction 

(a)  (5  points)  Seashells  are  used  for  currency  on  a  remote  island.  However,  there  are 
only huge shells worth 210   dollars and gigantic shells worth 312  dollars.  Suppose islander 
A  owes  m  >  0  dollars  to  islander  B .  Explain  why  the  debt  can  be  repaid  through  an 
exchange of shells provided A  and B  both have enough of each kind. 
Solution.  The greatest common divisor of 210  and 312  is 1, so there exist integers x  and y 
such that: 
·
· 
x  210  +  y 
312 
Multiplying both sides by m   gives: 
mx  · 210  +  my  ·  =  m 
312 
Thus,  islander  A  can  repay  the  debt  with  mx  huge  shells  and  my  gigantic  shells.  (A 
positive quantity indicates that A  gives shells to B  and a negative quantity indicates that 
� 
B  gives shells to A.)

Fn  =  Fn−1  +  Fn−2 
F1  = 1,
F0  = 0,

Solutions to the Final Examination 

6 

Solution.  We use  induction on n.  Let P (n)   be  the proposition  that Fn  and Fn+1  are rela­
tively prime. 
Base case: P (0) is true because F0  = 0  and F1  = 1  are relatively prime. 
Inductive  step:  Assume  that P (n)  is  true where  n  ≥  0;  that  is,  Fn  and Fn+1  are  relatively 
prime. We must show that Fn+1  and Fn+2  are relatively prime as well.  If Fn+1  and Fn+2  had 
a common divisor d >  1, then d  would also divide the linear combination Fn+2  − Fn+1  = 
Fn , contradicting the assumption that Fn  and Fn+1  are relatively prime.  So Fn+1  and Fn+2 
are relatively prime. 
The theorem follows by induction.

Solution.  Consider  all  the  teams  of  one  or more  people  along with  a  designated  team­
leader from among a group of n  people.  There are n  ways to pick the leader directly and 
2n−1  ways  to  pick  the  remaining members  of  the  team,  for  a  total  of  n2n−1  teams­with­
�  � 
leader. 
Alternatively, we  could pick a positive  integer  i  ≤  n,  then a  team of  i  ≥  1  people  (there

are  ways to do this), and then pick a leader of the team (there are i  ways to do that). So

the  total number of ways  to pick a  team­with­leader  in  this way  is

is the total number of 1’s in all 
of 1’s in all n­bit strings with i  1’s in them.  Then

at  least  one  of  the  two  youngest  children  is  a  boy.  In  the  tree  diagram  below,  all  edge

Problem 10 (15 points).  Probability and Expectation 
A box initially contains n  balls, all colored black. A ball is drawn from the box at random. 

•	 If  the  drawn  ball  is  black,  then  a  biased  coin  with  probability,  p  >  0,  of  coming 
up  heads  is  ﬂipped.  If  the  coin  comes  up  heads,  a  white  ball  is  put  into  the  box; 
otherwise the black ball is returned to the box. 

•	 If the drawn ball is white, then it is returned to the box. 

This process is repeated until the box contains n  white balls. 
Let D  be the number of balls drawn until the process ends with the box full of white balls. 
Prove that E [D] =  nHn/p, where Hn  is the nth Harmonic number. 
Hint:  Let  Di  be  the  number  of  draws  after  the  ith  white  ball  until  the  draw  when  the 
(i  +  1)st white ball is put into the box.

E [D] = 

Solution.  Suppose that the box contains k  white balls. The probability that a black ball is 
drawn and replaced by a white ball is p  · (n  − k)/n.  Taking the placement of a white ball 
into the box as a “failure,” we know the mean time to failure is 1/(p(n−k)/n) =  n/p(n−k). 
So E [Di ],  expected number of draws  to  introduce one more white ball  is n/p(n  − k).  By

Problem 12 (20 points).  Estimation and Conﬁdence 
On December 20, 2005, the MIT fabrication facility produced a long run of silicon wafers. 
To  estimate  the  fraction,  d,  of  defective  wafers  in  this  run,  we  will  take  a  sample  of  n 
independent random choices of wafers  from  the run,  test  them  for defects, and estimate 
that d is approximately the same as the fraction of defective wafers in the sample. 
A calculation based on  the Binomial Sampling Theorem  (given below) will yield a near­
minimal number,  n0 ,  and  such  that with  a  sample of  size n  =  n0 ,  the  estimated  fraction 
will be within 0.006 of the actual fraction, d, with 97% conﬁdence.

(b)  (10 points) The calculations in part (a) depend on some facts about the run and how 
the  n wafers  in  the  sample  are  chosen.  Write  T  or  F  next  to  each  of  the  following  state­
ments to indicate whether it is True or False. 

•	 T The probability that the ninth wafer in the sample is defective is d. 
Solution.  The ninth wafer in the sample is equally likely to be any wafer in the run, 
so  the probability  it  is defective  is  the same as  the  fraction, d, of defective wafers  in 
� 
the fabrication run. 
•	 F The probability that the ninth wafer in the run is defective is d. 
Solution.  The  fabrication  run  was  completed  yesterday,  so  there’s  nothing  proba­
bilistic about the defectiveness of the ninth (or any other) wafer in the run:  either it 
is or it isn’t defective, though we don’t know which. You could argue that this means 
it is defective with probability zero or one (we don’t know which), but in any case, it 
� 
certainly isn’t d. 
•	 T  All  wafers  in  the  run  are  equally  likely  to  be  selected  as  the  third  wafer  in  the 
sample. 
Solution.  The meaning of “random choices of wafers from the run” is precisely that 
at each of the n choices in the sample, in particular at the third choice, each wafer in 
� 
the run is equally likely to be chosen. 
•	 T  The  expectation  of  the  indicator  variable  for  the  last  wafer  in  the  sample  being 
defective is d. 
Solution.  The expectation of the indicator variable is the same as the probability that 
it  is 1, namely,  it  is  the probability  that  the nth wafer chosen  is defective, which we 
� 
observed in the ﬁrst part of this question is d. 
•	 F Given that the ﬁrst wafer in the sample is defective, the probability that the second 
wafer will also be defective is less than than d. 
Solution.  The meaning  of  “independent  random  choices  of wafers  from  the  run”  is 
precisely that at each of the n choices in the sample, in particular at the second choice, 
each wafer in the run is equally likely to be chosen, independent of what the ﬁrst or

any other choice happened to be. 
•	 F Given that the last wafer in the run is defective, the probability that the next­to­last 
wafer in the run will also be defective is less than than d.

Solution.  As noted above, it’s zero or one.	
•	 T  It  turns  out  that  there  are  several  different  colors  of  wafer.  Given  that  the  ﬁrst 
two  wafers  in  the  sample  are  the  same  color,  the  probability  that  the  ﬁrst  wafer  is 
defective may be < d. 
Solution.  We don’t know how color correlates to defectiveness.  It could be for exam­
ple,  that most wafers  in the run are white, and no white wafers are defective.  Then 
given that two randomly chosen wafers in the sample are the same color, their most

likely color  is white.  This makes  them  less  likely  to be defective  than usual,  that  is, 
� 
the conditional probability that they will be defective would be less than d. 
•	 T The probability that all the wafers in the sample will be different is nonzero. 
Solution.  We can assume the length, r , of the fabrication run is larger than the sam­
ple, in which case the probability that all the wafers in the sample are different is
