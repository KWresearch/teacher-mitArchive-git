Problem 1 (25 points).  Consider the following system speciﬁcations1 . 

1.  The system is in multiuser state iff it is operating normally. 

2.  If the system is operating normally, then the kernel is functioning. 

3.  The kernel is not functioning or the system is in interrupt mode. 

4.  If the system is not in multiuser state, then it is in interrupt mode. 

5.  The system is not in interrupt mode.

variables.

(b)  (0 points)  Are these system speciﬁcations consistent? 

. Prove it! 

Solution.  There  are  several ways  to  approach  this  problem.  One  is  to  construct  a  truth 
table with sixteen lines—one for each way of assigning truth values to the four variables 
M , N , K , and I . 
We  can  avoid  the  cumbersome  truthtable  if we  reason  by  cases.  Case  1:  I  is  true.  Then 
the  last  formula  (9)  is  false,  and  the whole  speciﬁcation  is  false.  Case  2:  I  is  false.  Now 
formula (8) can be true only if ¬ M is false, that is, only if M is true. Likewise, formula (7) 
can be true only if ¬ K is true, that is, K is false. 
Since K is false, formula (6) can be true only if N  is false.  Thus, we have deduced that in 
order to be consistent in this case, we must have 

I  =  false 
M  =  true 
K  =  false 
N  =  false. 

But now formula (5) is false, so it is impossible for all the formulas to be true:  the system 
� 
is inconsistent. 

Problem 2 (20 points).  For  each  of  the  following  logical  formulas  with  domain  of  dis­
course the natural numbers, N, indicate whether it is a possible formulation of 

I:  the Induction Axiom, 

S:  the Strong Induction Axiom, 

L:  the Least Number Principle (also known as Well­ordering), or 

N:  None of these. 

For example, the ordinary Induction Axiom could be expressed by the following formula, 
so it gets labelled “I”. 
(P (0) ∧ [∀ k P (k) −→ P (k + 1)]) −→ ∀ k P (k)

Solution.  I. This  is  a perfect  formulation of  the  Induction Axiom.  b is used  for  the base 
case; P (k) −→ P (k + 1) is the inductive case. 
� 

(b)  (0 points)  (P (b) ∧ [∀ k ≤ b P (k) −→ P (k + 1)]) −→ ∀ k ≤ b P (k) 
Solution.  N. The two occurences of k <= b should have been k >= b 

(c)  (0 points) 

[∀ b (∀ k < b P (k)) −→ P (b)] −→ ∀ k P (k) 
Solution.  S. Since you are assuming P (k) for all k < b, this is strong induction.

(d)  (0 points)  (∃ n P (n)) −→ ∃ n ∀ k < n P (k) 
Solution.  N. This statement is in fact always true; when n = 0, ∀ k < n P (k).  It should say 
P (n) ∧ ∀ k < n; P (k) 
� 

(e)  (0 points)  ∀ n [P (n) −→ (∃ n P (n) ∧ ∀ k < n P (k))] 
Solution.  L. This is a valid formulation; it does not have that problem in (2d).

Problem 3 (20 points).  Classify each of the following binary relations as 

E:  An equivalence relation. 

T:  A Total order, 

P:  A Partial order that is not total. 

S:  A Symmetric relation that is not transitive. 

N:  None of the above. 

This is a multiple choice problem: do not explain your answer. 

(a)  (0  points)  The  relation  xRy  between  times  of  day  such  that  x and  y  are  at  most 
twenty minutes apart.

Solution.  S:  This  relation  is  reﬂexive  and  symmetric.  It  is  not  transitive;  Consider  the 
counter­example:  1:00R 1:15, 1:15R 1:22 but ¬1:00R 1:22. 
� 

(b)  (0 points)  The relation xRy  between times of day such that x  is more than twenty 
minutes later than y . 
Solution.  P: This  relation  is antisymmetric and  transitive but not  reﬂexive  (since a  time 
isn’t 20 minutes after itself). This is not a total ordering because some times are incompa­
rable to each other.  For example, 1:15  is incomparable to 1:22. 
Note:  This  answer  assumes  that  the  question  was  referring  to  the  moments  in  time  in 
a  single  day.  Otherwise,  one  could  argue  that  1:00  precedes  1:22  on  tuesday,  but  1:22  on 
tuesday precedes 1:00 on wednesday, and then the relation would not be antisymmetric.� 

(c)  (0  points)  The  relation  xRy  over  all  words  in  this  sentence  such  that  x  does  not 
appear after y .  (Consider “x”, “y”, and “xRy” to be words.) 
Solution.  T: Because all  the words  in  the sentence are unique,  this  relation  is  transitive, 
antisymmetric, and reﬂexive.  This makes the relation a partial order.  However,  the rela­
� 
tion is also a total order, because any two elements are comparable. 

(d)  (0 points)  The  relation xRy  over all words  in  this  sentence such  that word x does 
not appear after word y . 
Solution.  P:  This  is  the  same  as  saying  that  all  appearances  of  a  word  x  occur  before 
all  appearances  of  a  word  y .  While  apparently  very  similar  to  part  c,  this  relation  is 
not  reﬂexive  because  the  word  word  appears  twice  in  the  sentence.  It  is  transitive  and 
antisymmetric,  but not a  total order because all  the words between  the  two occurrences 
� 
of word are incomparable to word. 

(e)  (0 points)  The  relation xRy  over  all words  in  this  sentence  such  that  the ﬁnal  ap­
pearance of y occurs after x. 
Solution.  N: This relation  is not reﬂexive and  transitive.  It  is neither symmetric nor an­
tisymmetric;  the  word  the  occurs  twice,  all  the  others  once.  All  words  w ,  between  the 
two  occurrences  of  the  satisfy  wR the  and  theRw .  So R  is  not  anti­symmetric.  But  “x”  is 
� 
maximal, so it’s not symmetric either.

Problem 4 (35 points).  To  encourage  collaborative  study,  the  6.042  staff  is  considering 
assigning each student  to a study group with  two or  three other students.  Prove  that as 
long  as  the  enrollment  is  large  enough,  the  class  can  always  be divided  into  such  study 
groups. 

Solution.  Proof.  The proof is by strong induction. The induction hypothesis is that a class 
with n ≥ 6 students can be divided into teams of 3 or 4. More precisely 
P (n) ::=  n ≥ 6 −→ ∃ x, y ∈ N 3x + 4y = n. 
For any n ≥ 0, we may assume P (6), . . . , P (n − 1) to prove P (n). 
Case 1:  (n < 6). P (n) holds because the hypothesis n ≥ 6 is false. 
Case  2:  (n  = 6, 7,  or 8)  P (6)  is  true  because  there  could  be  two  teams  of  3,  P (7)  is  true 
because  there could be a  team of 3 and a team of 4, and P (8)  is  true because  there could 
be two teams of 4. 
Case 3:  (n ≥ 9). Of course n > n − 3 so P (n − 3) holds by the strong induction hypothesis. 
But  n − 3  ≥  6,  so  P (n − 3)  implies  3x
