Solutions to Quiz 1 

Problem  1  (15  points).  Let  G  be  an  undirected  graph.  Let  P (x,  y)  mean  that  there  is  a 
path  from  vertex  x  to  vertex  y .  Express  each  of  the  following  sentences  in  terms  of  P , 
quantiﬁers, logical connectives, and equality, using variables that range over the vertices 
of G.  (Reminder:  there is a zero­length path from any vertex to itself.) 

(a)  (3 points) Vertices x  and y  are in the same connected component. 

Solution.  P (x,   y) 

� 

(b)  (3  points) G  has  a  vertex  of  degree  zero.  (Reminder:  undirected  graphs  only  have 
edges between distinct vertices, that is, no self­loops.) 
Solution.  ∃x∀y .  P (x,   y)  −→ x  =  y . 

� 

(c)  (4 points) G  has at least three connected components. 

Solution. 

∃x,  y , z .   ¬P (x,  y) ∧ ¬P (x,  z ) ∧ ¬P (y , z ).  

� 

(d)  (5 points) There is a positive­length simple path from x   to y . 

Solution.  There is a positive length simple path between two vertices iff the vertices are 
distinct and there is a path between them, so we can express this as 
x  =  y ∧ P (x,  y).

Problem 2 (10 points).  Classify each of the following binary relations as 

E:  An equivalence relation. 

T:  A Total order, 

P:  A Partial order that is not total. 

S:  A Symmetric relation that is not transitive. 

N:  None of the above. 

(a)  (2 points) The relation between times during a single day: x  and y  are at most twenty 
minutes apart. 

Solution.  S:  This  relation  is  obviously  symmetric.  It  is  not  transitive:  1:00R 1:15,  and 
1:15R 1:22, but ¬ (1:00R 1:22). 
� 

(b)  (2  points)  The  relation  between  times  during  a  single  day:  x  is  more  than  twenty 
minutes later than y . 

Solution.  P: This relation is asymmetric and transitive.  It is not a total ordering because 
some times are incomparable to each other.  For example, 1:15  is incomparable to 1:22.  � 

(c)  (2 points) The relation between vertices in an arbitrary digraph:  there is a path from 
v  to w . 

Solution.  N:  This  relation  is  transitive  but  won’t  be  a  partial  order  unless  the  graph  is 
� 
acyclic. 

(d)  (2 points) The relation between vertices in an undirected graph:  there is a path from 
v  to w . 

Solution.  E:  In  fact,  the  connected  components  of  the graph  are  the  equivalence  classes 
� 
of this relation. 

(e)  (2  points)  The  relation  between  Fall  ’05  6.042  students:  student  s  is  older  but  also 
shorter than t. 

Solution.  P: This relation is the product of the “older than” and the “shorter than” orders, 
and  so  is  a  partial  order.  It  is  not  total  because  there  is  a  younger  student who  is  taller 
� 
than an older student.

Problem 3 (20 points).  Let G0  = 1, G1  = 2, G2  = 4, and deﬁne 

Gn  ::=  Gn−1  +  2Gn−2  +  Gn−3 
for n   ≥ 3.  Show by induction that Gn  ≤ (2.2)n  for all n  ≥ 0.

Solution.  The proof is by strong induction with hypothesis P (n)   :=  Gn  ≤ (2.2)n  .


Proof.  Base Cases 
n  = 0: G0  ::=  1  = (2.2)0  .

n  = 1: G1  ::=  2  <  2.2  = (2.2)1  .

n  = 2: G2  ::=  4   <  4.84   = (2.2)2  .

Inductive Step: Assume n  ≥ 2  and P (k) for all k  such that 0  ≤ k  ≤ n.

Problem  4  (20  points).  An  intersection  graph  is  an  undirected  graph  whose  vertices  are 
sets  and whose  edges  are  speciﬁed  by  the  rule  that  there  is  an  edge  between  vertices A 
and B  iff A  =  B  and A  ∩ B  =  ∅. 

(a)  (1 point) Draw the intersection graph whose vertices are the sets 
{1,   2,   3} ,  {1,   9,   10} ,  {2,  4,  6,  8,  10} ,  {3,  4,  5} ,  {5,  6,  7} ,  {7,  8,  9}

(b)  (3 points) What is the chromatic number of the graph in part (a)? 
Solution.  4.  The  graph  is  isomorphic  to  the wheel, W5 .  All wheels with  an  odd­length

rim have chromatic number 4, as explained in lecture.

We now consider an arbitrary undirected graph, G.  For any vertex, v , of G, let I (v) be the 
set of edges incident to v . 

(d)  (3  points)  Explain  how  to  uniquely  determine  the  vertex  v  given  any  two  edges  in 
I (v). 
Solution.  Just ﬁnd a vertex that the two edges have in common. This must be v . 

� 

(e)  (10 points) An  incidence­set  is  the  set  of  edges  incident  to  some  vertex,  that  is,  a  set 
equal  to  I (v)  for  some  vertex  v  of G.  Prove  that  if G  is  a  graph whose  vertices  all  have 
degree greater  than  1,  then  the  function,  I ,  is  an  isomorphism between G  and  the  inter­
section graph whose vertices are the incidence­sets of G. 
Solution.  Let H  be the intersection graph whose vertices are the incidence­sets of G.  By 
deﬁnition of H , the function, I , is a surjection onto the vertices of H . Moreover, since each 
incidence­set contains at least two edges, part (d) implies that given I (v), we can uniquely 
determine  v .  This means  I  is  also  an  injection  into  the  vertices  of H ,  and  therefore  is  a 
bijection from the vertices of G  to the vertices of H . Also 
[v—w   ∈ I (v) and v—w   ∈ I (w)]  
iff 
�=  w  and I (v) ∩ I (w) �=  ∅ 
iff  v 
iff  I (v)—I (w) is an edge of H, 

v—w  is an edge of G

which proves that I  is an isomorphism. 
Incidentally,  if  G  happens  to  have  any  vertices  of  degree  <  2,  then  it’s  easy  to  assign 
special sets to these vertices in such a way that these special sets, along with the incidence 
sets of vertices of degree ≥  2, are the vertices of an intersection graph that is isomorphic 
to G. This shows that every undirected graph is isomorphic to an intersection graph.  � 

Problem 5 (10 points).  Two banks only allow transactions that are multiples of 39  dollars 
or  57  dollars.  Is  there  a  series  of  transactions  whose  net  result  is  a  payment  of  1  dollar 
from the ﬁrst bank to the second bank? Brieﬂy explain why or why not. 

Solution.  Yes.  Since 39  and 57  have no common prime factors, their gcd is 1, and so there 
are  positive  integers  s,  t  such  that  s  (39 )  −  t  (57 )  = 1.  So  the  ﬁrst  bank  should  pay  the 
second bank 39  dollars s  times, and accept payment of 57  dollars form the second bank t 
� 
times for a net transfer of 1 dollar to the second bank. 

Problem 6  (15 points).  Each year,  Santa’s  reindeer hold “Reindeer Games”,  from which 
Rudolph is pointedly excluded.  The Games consist of a sequence of matches, where one 
reindeer competes against another. Draws are not possible. 
On Christmas Eve, Santa produces a rank list of all his reindeer.  If reindeer p  lost a match 
to reindeer q , then p  appears below q  in Santa’s ranking, but if he has any choice because 
of unplayed matches, Santa can give higher rank to the reindeer he likes better. To prevent 
confusion, two reindeer may not play a match if either outcome would lead to a cycle of 
reindeer, where each lost to the next. 
Though it is only October, the 2004 Reindeer Games have already begun. We can describe 
the  results  so  far with  a binary  relation,  L,  on  the  set of  reindeer, where  pLq  means  that 
reindeer  p  lost  a match  to  reindeer  q .  Let  L+  be  the  corresponding  positive­length  path 
relation1 . Note that L+  is a partial order, so we can regard a match loser as “smaller ” than 
the winner. 

On  the  following page you’ll ﬁnd a  list of  terms and a  sequence of  statements.  Add  the 
appropriate term to each statement. 

1Thus, reindeer p  is related to reindeer q  by L+  if p  lost to q  or if p  lost to a reindeer who lost to q  or if p 
lost to a reindeer who lost to a reindeer who lost to q , etc.

(j)  (2  points)  Suppose  that  Santa  has  11  reindeer.  If  no  more  matches  can  be  played, 
what is the smallest possible number of matches already played? 

Solution.  10. 
Call  the  reindeer  r1 , . . . , r11 .  Then  no more matches  can  be played  if  r1  lost  to  r2 ,  r2  lost 
to r3 , etc.  If only ten matches have been played, then the corresponding digraph will not 
even be connected  if we  regard  the edges as undirected.  So  there would be  two disjoint 
sets of reindeer, S and T , such that no reindeer in S has played a match against a reindeer 
in  T .  Therefore,  more matches  can  be  played;  in  particular,  any  reindeer  in  S  can  play 
� 
against any reindeer in T . 

Problem 7 (10 points).  A map is a connected planar graph with a planar drawing whose 
face boundaries are simple cycles. 

(a)  (7 points) Prove that if a map has no simple cycle of length 3, then 
e ≤ 2v − 4, 
where v is the number of vertices and e is the number of edges in the graph.

Solution.  Since there is no simple cycle of length 3 and face boundaries are simple cycles, 
every  face must  be  of  length  4  or more.  We  know  that  in  a  planar  drawing,  each  edge

appears twice on the face boundaries, so 
4  = 4f , 
b∈ boundaries 
b∈ boundaries 
where f  is  the number of  faces.  By Euler ’s  formula,  f  =  e  − v  +  2,  so  substituting  for f 
in (3), yields 
2e  ≥ 4(e  − v  +  2),

(b)  (3  points)  Prove  that K3,3  is  not  a map.  (K3,3  is  the  graph with  six  vertices  and  an 
edge from each of the ﬁrst three vertices to each of the last three.) 

Solution.  K3,3  is by deﬁnition bipartite,  and hence has no odd­length  simple  cycle,  and 
in particular, no length 3 cycle.  (This could also be checked exhaustively.) 
However, it has 9 edges and 6 vertices, and since 9  >  8  = 2 6  − 4, it does not satisfy (2),
· 
and so cannot be a map. 
Incidentally,  this  implies  that  K3,3  is  not  planar.  The  reason  is  that  connected  planar 
graphs which  are  not maps  are  the  ones with  “dongles”  or  “crossbars,”  as  explained  in 
lecture.  But all edges  in dongles and  crossbars are  cut edges.  So a  connected graph  like 
� 
K3,3   with no cut edges is planar iff it is a map.
