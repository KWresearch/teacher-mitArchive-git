Problem Set 8 
Due: November 21 

Reading: Counting Notes, II.§4–5; Notes on Generating Functions 

Problem 1.  Find the coefﬁcients of 

(a)  x10  in (x  +  (1/x))100  
(b)  xk  in (x − (1/x))n  .

Problem  2.  Suppose  a  generalized World  Series  between  the  Sox  and  the  Cardinals  in­
volved 2n  +  1  games.  As usual,  the generalized Series will stop as soon as one team has 
won more than half the possible games. 

(a)  Suppose that when the Sox ﬁnally win the GSeries, the Cards have managed to win 
exactly r  games (so r  ≤ n).  How many possible win­loss patterns are possible for the Sox 
to win the GSeries in this way? Express your answer as a binomial coefﬁcient. 

(b)  How  many  possible  win­loss  patterns  are  possible  for  the  Sox  to  win  the  GSeries 
when the Cards win at most r  games? Express your answer as a binomial coefﬁcient.

Problem 3.  (a)  1  Let an  be the number of length n ternary strings (strings of the digits 0, 
1, and 2) that contain two consecutive digits that are the same.  For example, a2  = 3  since 
the only ternary strings of length 2 with matching consecutive digits are 11, 22, and 33. 
Also, a0  =  a1  = 0, since in order to have consecutive matching digits, a string must be of 
length at least two. 
Find a recurrence formula for an . 

(b)  Show that

x
(1  − 3x)(1  − 2x)

(d)  Use the previous results to write a closed form for the nth term in the sequence. 

Problem  4.  Suppose  there  are  four  kinds  of  doughnuts:  plain,  chocolate,  glazed,  and 
butterscotch. Write generating functions for the number of ways to select the ﬂavors of n 
doughnuts, subject to the following different constraints. 

(a)  Each ﬂavor occurs an odd number of times. 

(b)  Each ﬂavor occurs a multiple of 3 times. 

(c)  There are no chocolate doughnuts and at most one glazed doughnut. 

(d)  There are 1, 3, or 11 chocolate doughnuts, and 2, 4, or 5 glazed. 

(e)  Each ﬂavor occurs at least 10 times.
