Solutions to Problem Set 5


Problem  1.  Suppose  that  one  domino  can  cover  exactly  two  squares  on  a  chessboard, 
either vertically or horizontally. 
(a)  Can you tile an 8  × 8  chessboard with 32 dominos? 

Solution.  Yes. Place 4 vertical dominos in each column. 

� 

(b)  Can you tile an 8  × 8  chessboard with 31 dominos if opposite corners are removed? 

Solution.  No!  Opposing  corners  are  the  same  color.  Therefore,  removing  opposite  cor­
ners  leaves  an unequal number  of white  and  black  squares.  Since  every domino  covers 
� 
one black square and one white square, no tiling is possible.

(c)  Now  suppose  that  an  assortment  of  squares  are  removed  from  a  chessboard.  An 
example is shown below. 

Given a truncated chessboard, show how to construct a bipartite graph G  that has a per­
fect matching if and only if the chessboard can be tiled with dominos. 
Solution.  Create a vertex for every white square and a vertex for every black square. Put 
an edge between squares that share an edge.  (This graph is bipartite, since the coloring of 
the squares deﬁnes a valid 2­coloring of the vertices.) 
If a perfect matching exists in this graph, then a tiling exists: put a domino over each pair 
of matched vertices.  On  the other hand,  if a  tiling exists,  then a perfect matching exists: 
� 
match squares covered by the same domino. 

(d)  Based  on  this  construction  and Hall’s  theorem,  can you  state  a necessary  and  sufﬁ­
cient condition for a truncated chessboard to be tilable with dominos? Try not to mention 
graphs or matchings! 
Solution.  A board can be  tiled with dominos  if and only  if every set of white squares  is 
� 
adjacent to at least as many black squares and vice versa. 

Problem 2.  Prove that gcd(ka,  kb) =  k  · gcd(a,  b) for all k >  0. 
Solution.  The smallest positive value of: 

·
· 
k  · 
(s a  +  t b)
(which is equal to s(ka) +  t(kb) =  gcd(ka,  kb)) must be k  times the smallest positive value 
of: 

(which is equal to gcd(a,  b)).

Problem  3.  Suppose  that  a  ≡  b  (mod   n)  and  n  >  0.  Prove  or  disprove  the  following 
assertions: 

(a)  a ≡ bc  (mod  n) where c  ≥ 0 
c
Solution.  The  proof  is  by  induction  on  c  with  the  hypothesis  that  a ≡  bc  (mod  n).  If 
c
c  = 0, then the claim holds, because 1  ≡ 1  (mod   n). Now suppose that: 

a  ≡ 
c 

bc 

(mod  n)

Multiplying both sides by a  gives: 

≡ 
abc 
(mod   n)
a 
Since a  ≡ b  (mod  n), we can replaced the a  on the right side by b: 

c+1 

c+1 

a 

≡  bc+1 

(mod   n) 

Therefore, the claim holds by induction. 

(b)  ca  ≡ cb  (mod  n) where a,  b,  ≥ 0 
Solution.  The claim is false.  For example:

Problem 4.  An inverse of k  modulo n  >  1  is an integer, k−1 , such that 
k k−1  ≡ 1 
· 

(mod  n).

Show that k  has an inverse iff gcd(k , n)  = 1.  Hint:  We saw how to prove the above when n  is 
prime.

Solution.  If gcd(k , n)  = 1, then there exist integers x and y such that kx +  yn  = 1.  There­
fore, yn = 1   − kx, which means n (1  − kx) and so kx ≡ 1  (mod   n). Let k−1  be x.

Problem 5.  Here is a long run of composite numbers: 

114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126 

Prove  that  there  exist  arbitrarily  long  runs  of  composite  numbers.  Consider  numbers  a 
little bigger than n!  where n! =  n · (n − 1) 
· · ·
·
·
3 2 1.
Solution.  Let k be some natural number such that 1  < k ≤ n. We know k (n! + k) because
|
k | n!  and k k .  Thus, the numbers n!  +  2, n!  +  3, n!  +  4, . . . , n!  +  n must all be composite. 
|
This is a run of n − 1  consecutive composite numbers.  Because we can arbitrarily choose 
� 
n, we know arbitrarily long runs of compisite numbers exist. 

Problem 6.  Take a big number,  such as 37273761261.  Sum  the digits, where every other 
one is negated: 

3  +  (−7)  +  2   +  (−7)  +  3  +  (−7)  +  6  +  (−1)  +  2  +  (−6)  +  1  =  −11 

As it turns out, the original number is a multiple of 11 if and only if this sum is a multiple 
of 11. 
(a)  Use a result from elsewhere on this problem set to show that 10k  ≡ −1k  (mod  11). 
Solution.  We know 10  ≡ −1  (mod  11).  From 2a, we conclude 10k  ≡ (−1)k  (mod  11).

(b)  Using this fact, explain why the procedure above works. 

Solution.  A number in decimal has the form: 

dk  · 10k  +  dk−1  10k−1  +  . . . +  d1  10  +  d0

Note  that  the  above  assumes  k  is  even.  The  case  where  k  is  odd  is  analogous.  Also, 
the procedure given  in  the problem may have us  reverse  all  signs.  Because we  are only 
� 
checking for divisibility, this does not matter. 

Problem 7.  Let Sk  = 1k  +  2k  +  . . . +  (p − 1)k , where p is an odd prime and k is a positive 
multiple of p − 1. Use Fermat’s theorem to prove that Sk  ≡ −1  (mod   p). 
Solution.  Fermat’s theorem says that xp−1  ≡ 1  (mod   p) when 1  ≤ x  ≤ p − 1.  Since k is a 
multiple of p − 1, raising each side to a suitable power proves that xk  ≡ 1  (mod   p). Thus:
