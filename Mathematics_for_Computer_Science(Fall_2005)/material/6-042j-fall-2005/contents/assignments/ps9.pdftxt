Problem Set 9 
Due: December 2 

Reading:  Week  12 Notes.  Week  13 Notes,  Sections  1  and  2  (Random  Variables  and  the 
Birthday Principle). 

Problem 1.  Professor Plum, Mr.  Green, and Miss Scarlet are all plotting to shoot Colonel 
Mustard.  If one of  these  three has both  an  opportunity  and  the  revolver,  then  that person 
shoots Colonel Mustard.  Otherwise,  Colonel Mustard  escapes.  Exactly  one  of  the  three 
has an opportunity with the following probabilities: 
Pr {Plum has opportunity} = 1/6 
Pr {Green has opportunity} = 2/6 
Pr {Scarlet has opportunity} = 3/6 

Exactly  one  has  the  revolver  with  the  following  probabilities,  regardless  of  who  has  an 
opportuntity: 

Pr {Plum has revolver} = 4/8 
Pr {Green has revolver} = 3/8 
Pr {Scarlet has revolver} = 1/8 

(a)  Draw a tree diagram for this problem.  Indicate edge and outcome probabilities. 

(b)  What is the probability that Colonel Mustard is shot? 

(c)  What is the probability that Colonel Mustard is shot, given that Miss Scarlet does not 
have the revolver? 

(d)  What is the probability that Mr.  Green had an opportunity, given that Colonel Mus­
tard was shot?

Problem Set 9 

Problem 2.  There are three prisoners in a maximum­security prison for ﬁctional villains: 
the Evil Wizard Voldemort, the Dark Lord Sauron, and Little Bunny Foo­Foo.  The parole 
board has declared that it will release two of the three, chosen uniformly at random, but 
has not yet released their names.  Naturally, Sauron ﬁgures that he will be released to his 
home in Mordor, where the shadows lie, with probability 2/3. 
A guard offers to tell Sauron the name of one of the other prisoners who will be released 
(either  Voldemort  or  Foo­Foo).  However,  Sauron  declines  this  offer.  He  reasons  that 
if  the  guard  says,  for  example,  “Little  Bunny  Foo­Foo  will  be  released”,  then  his  own 
probability of release will drop to 1/2. This is because he will then know that either he or 
Voldemort will also be released, and these two events are equally likely. 
Using a  tree diagram and  the  four­step method,  either prove  that  the Dark Lord Sauron 
has  reasoned correctly or prove  that he  is wrong.  Assume  that  if  the guard has a choice 
of naming either Voldemort or Foo­Foo (because both are to be released), then he names 
one of the two uniformly at random. 

Problem 3.  You shufﬂe a deck of cards and deal your friend a 5­card hand. 

(a)  Suppose your friend says, “I have the ace of spades.” What is the probablity that she 
has another ace? 

(b)  Suppose your  friend  says,  “I have an ace.”  What  is  the probability  that  she has an­
other ace? 

(c)  Are your answers to (a) and (b) the same? Explain why. 

Problem  4.  Finalphobia  is  a  rare  disease  in which  the  victim  has  the  delusion  that  he  or 
she is being subjected to an intense mathematical examination. 

•  A person selected uniformly at random has ﬁnalphobia with probability 1/100. 

•  A person with ﬁnalphobia has shaky hands with probability 9/10. 

•  A person without ﬁnalphobia has shaky hands with probability 1/20. 

What is the probablility that a person selected uniformly at random has ﬁnalphobia, given 
that he or she has shaky hands?

Problem  5.  Outside  of  their  hum­drum  duties  as  6.042  TAs,  Sayan  is  trying  to  learn  to 
levitate  using  only  intense  concentration  and  Jelani  is  launching  a  “Nelson  2008”  presi­
dential campaign.  Suppose that Sayan’s probability of levitating is 1/6, Jelani’s chance of 
becoming president is 1/4, and the success of one does not alter the other ’s chances. 

(a)  If at least one of them succeeds, what is the probability that Sayan learns to levitate? 

(b)  If at most one of them succeeds, what is the probability that Jelani becomes the pres­
ident of the United States? 

(c)  If exactly one of them succeeds, what is the probability that it is Sayan? 

Problem 6.  Suppose n balls are thrown randomly into n boxes, so each ball lands in each 
box with uniform probability.  Also,  suppose  the outcome of  each  throw  is  independent 
of all the other throws. 

(a)  Let  Xi  be  an  indicator  random  variable  whose  value  is  1  if  box  i  is  empty  and  0 
otherwise.  Write  a  simple  closed  form  expression  for  the  probability  distribution  of Xi . 
Are X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn  independent random variables?

Problem  7.  (An  open­ended  discussion  question.)  Consider  a  set,  S ,  consisting  of  77 
twenty­one digit numbers. We can use the pigeonhole principle to prove that two distinct 
subsets  of  the  numbers  in  S  have  the  same  sum,  but  actually  ﬁnding  two  such  sets  is 
can be difﬁcult.  Naively, we could sum  the elements  in all 277  subsets and ﬁnd  two  that 
match, but this is a huge computational task.

√
Recall the birthday principle:  If there are d days in a year and 
2d people in a room, then 
the probability that two share a birthday is about 1  − 1/e = 0.632 . . .. 
How could  the birthday principle help you ﬁnd  two distinct subsets of S with  the same 
sum using signiﬁcantly fewer than 277  operations —say only a trillion operations?  What 
assumptions must you make?
