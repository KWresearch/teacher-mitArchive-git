Problem 2.  The proof of  the Handshake Theorem  in Week 5 Notes  is a  little more  infor­
mal  than  is  desirable  in  the  beginning  of  6.042.  Rewrite  the  proof more  carefully  as  an 
induction on the number of edges in a graph. 

Problem  3.  The  distance  between  two  vertices  in  a  graph  is  the  length  of  the  shortest 
path between them.  For example, the distance between two vertices in a graph of airline 
connections is the minimum number of ﬂights required to travel between two cities.  The 
diameter of a graph is the distance between the two vertices that are farthest apart.

(a)  What is the diameter of the following graph? Brieﬂy explain your answer. 

Solution.  The diameter of  the graph  above  is  5.  The most­distant vertices  are A  and G, 
� 
which are at distance 5 from one another. 

(b)  What is the chromatic number of this graph? Prove it. 

Solution.  It’s  easy  to  ﬁnd  a  3­coloring,  for  example,  let  C, D, E  be  colored  c,  d, e,  then 
color  B ,  H  and  F  with  color  d,  and  G  and H  with  e.  The  chromatic  number  cannot  be 
less than 3, because vertices C, D, E  are all connected and therefore must receive distinct 
� 
colors. Consequently, the chromatic number of the graph is exactly 3. 

(c)  Suppose  every  vertex  in  a  graph  is within  distance  n  of  a  vertex,  v .  Prove  that  the 
diameter of the graph is at most 2n. 

Solution.  Let x  and y  be arbitrary vertices in the graph. Then there exists a path of length 
at most d  from x  to v , and there exists a path of length at most d  from v  to y . 

Let  z  be  the  vertex  that  lies  on  both  the  x­to­v  and  v ­to­y  paths  and  is  closest  to  x.  (We 
know that such a vertex exists, since z  could be v , at least.)  Joining the x­to­z  segment to 
the z ­to­y  segment gives a path from x  to y  of length at most 2n.  Therefore, every vertex 
� 
is within distance 2n  of every other.

Problem  4.  If  a  graph  is  connected,  then  every  vertex  must  be  adjacent  to  some  other 
vertex.  Is  the  converse  of  this  statement  true?  If  every  vertex  is  adjacent  to  some  other 
vertex, then is the graph connected? The answer is no. 

(a)  Give a minimal example of a graph  in which every vertex  is adjacent to at  least one 
other vertex, but the graph is not connected. 

(b)  So  something  is wrong with  the  following proof.  Exactly where  is  the ﬁrst mistake 
in the proof? 

False  Theorem  4.1.  If  every  vertex  in  a  graph  is  adjacent  to  another  vertex,  then  the  graph  is 
connected. 

Nothing helps a false proof like a good picture; see Figure 1. 

Figure 1:  This picture  accompanies  the  false proof.  Two  situations  are depicted.  In  one,  vertices 
x1  and x2  both are among the vertices of G, and so there is a connecting path by induction.  In the 
second, v  =  x1  and x2  is a vertex of G.  In this case there is a connecting path because there is an 
edge from v  to u  and a path in G  from u  to x2  by induction. 

Proof.  The  proof  is  by  induction.  Let  P (n)  be  the  predicate  that  if  every  vertex  in  an  n­
vertex graph is adjacent to another vertex,  then the graph is connected.  In the base case, 
P (1) is trivially true because there is only one vertex. 
In the inductive step, we assume P (n) to prove P (n  + 1). Start with an n + 1­vertex graph, 
G� ,  in  which  every  vertex  is  adjacent  to  another  vertex.  Now  take  some  vertex  v  away 
from  the graph and  let  the G  be  the  remaining graph.  By assumption v  is adjacent  in G� 
to one of the n  vertices of G; call that one u. 
Now we must show that for every pair of distinct vertices x1  and x2  in G� , there is a path 
between  them.  If  both  x1  and  x2  are  vertices  of G,  then  since G  has  n  vertices,  we may 
assume by induction it is connected. So there is a path between x1  and x2 . Otherwise, one 
of the vertices is v  (say x1 ) and the other, x2  is in G. But x2  is connected to u  by induction, 
so there is a path from x1  to u  to x2  as shown in the ﬁgure.

Solution.  The error is in the statement “since G has n vertices, we may assume by  induction 
it  is  connected.”  The  induction hypothesis does not  say  that every n­vertex graph  is con­
nected,  but  only,  “if  every  vertex  in  an  n­vertex  graph  is  adjacent  to  another  vertex,  then  the 
graph  is  connected”.  For  example,  if  G�  is  the  graph  with  vertices  1,  2,  3,  4  and  edges 
{1, 2}  and  {3, 4},  then  removing  vertex  1  to  form G leaves  vertex  2 without  an  adjacent 
vertex  in G,  and we  can’t  conclude by  induction  that G is  connected  (which of  course  it 
� 
isn’t). 

Problem 5.  (a)  Show that every planar graph has a node of degree at most 5.  Hint:  Use 
the 3v − 6 inequality. 
Solution.  Consider  some planar graph G.  Take any connected component H of G.  If H 
has  at most  2  vertices,  then  every  vertex  in H has  degree  at most  1.  Otherwise,  for  the 
� 
� 
sake of contradiction suppose that every vertex in H has degree at least 6. Then 
deg(n) ≥ 
6 =  6v > 6v − 12, 
n∈V
n∈V 
contradicting  the  fact  that  e ≤  3v − 6 in  any  connected  planar  graph with more  than  2 
� 
vertices.

(b)  Conclude that any planar graph can be colored with six colors. 

Solution.  The  proof  is  almost  identical  to  the  proof  in Week  5 Notes  that  a  graph with 
maximum degree d is d + 1 colorable. 
The proof is by strong induction on the number, v , of vertices.  The induction hypothesis 
is 

P (v) : A planar graph with v vertices can be colored with at most 6 colors. 
Base cases (v ≤ 6): P (v) is true because each vertex can be assigned a different color. 
Inductive step: Assume P (v) is true for some v ≥ 6 and show that P (v + 1) is true. 
Let G be a planar graph with v + 1 vertices.  By part (a), there is a node, n, of degree ≤  5. 
Let G�  be the subgraph of G obtained by removing node n and all edges incident to it. 
Now G�  has  v ­vertices  and  is  also  planar,  so  by  induction  hypothesis, G�  can  be  colored 
with 6 colors. Now re­attach n. Since n is adjacent to at most 5 vertices, there is a 6th color 
for n different from colors of its adjacent vertices. This yields a 6­coloring of G. 
We have shown that P (v) → P (v + 1), so the proof is complete.
