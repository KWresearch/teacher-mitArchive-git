Problem Set 3 
Due: October 3 

Reading: Week 4 Notes. 

Problem 1.  (a)  List all the different binary relations on the set {0, 1}. 
(b)  Over the domain {0, 1}, which of these relations are weak partial orders?  strict partial 
orders?  equivalence relations? 

Problem 2.  We partially order the power set, P ({1, 2, . . . , n}), by the subset relation, ⊆. 
(a)  Describe a maximum length chain in P ({1, 2, . . . , n}). Brieﬂy explain why there can’t 
be a longer chain than the one you described. 
(b)  Describe a topological sort of P ({1, 2, . . . , n}), with a brief justiﬁcation that your sort 
is correct. 
(c)  Use Dilworth’s Lemma to show that there must be an antichain of size ≥ 2n/(n +  1). 
Describe the biggest antichain that you can ﬁnd. 

Problem 3.  Consider the natural numbers partially ordered by divisibility. 

(a)  Prove that this partial order has an inﬁnite chain. 

(b)  Prove that this partial order has an inﬁnite antichain. 
(c)  Now restrict the domain to the natural numbers ≤  n.  Consider the chain 1  �R  2  �R 
4  �R  . . .  �R  2�log2  n� . Prove that it is maximal. 
(d)  Let c be the length of the power of 2 chain. By Dilworth’s Lemma there is an antichain 
of length n/c. Describe one.

Problem 4.  We  consider DAG’s where  each vertex  represents a  task  to be  completed.  If 
there is a path from one vertex, v , to another vertex, w , then the v  task must be completed 
before the w  task. Assuming all tasks take unit time to complete, we showed in the Notes 
that the minimum time schedule to complete all the tasks is the size (number of vertices), 
t, of the longest path (chain) in the DAG. 
Formally,  a  schedule  for  a DAG  is  a  partition  of  the  vertices.  Each  block  of  the  partition 
is supposed to correspond to a set of tasks that are to be performed simultaneously.  The 
number of processors required by a schedule is the maximum number of tasks that are sched­
uled to be performed simultaneously. 

(a)  Describe purely in terms of graph, partition, and partial order properties (no informal 
descriptions in terms of “jobs,” “parallel processing,” etc.): 

•	 exactly the properties a vertex partition of a DAG must satisfy in order to represent 
a possible schedule for the vertex tasks, 
•	 the total time required to complete a schedule, 
•	 the number of processors required by a schedule. 

(b)  Give a small example of a DAG with more than one minimum time schedule. 

(c)  Explain why any schedule  that  requires only p  processors  to complete n  tasks must 
take time at least �n/p�. 
(d)  Let Dn,t  be  the DAG with n  vertices  that consists of a directed path of  t  − 1  vertices 
ending  with  edges  from  the  ﬁnal,  (t  −  1)st,  vertex  on  the  path  directly  to  each  of  the 
remaining n  − (t  − 1)  vertices, as in the following ﬁgure: 

What  is  the  minimum  time  schedule  for  Dn,t?  Explain  why  it  is  unique.  How  many 
processors does it require? 

. . .. . .t - 1n - (t - 1)Problem Set 3

(e)  Describe a minimum time p­processor schedule for Dn,t .  Write a simple formula for 
this minimum time, M (n,  t,   p). 

(f)  Show  that  every DAG with n  vertices and maximum chain  size,  t, has a p­processor 
schedule that runs in time M (n,  t,   p). 
Hint:  Induction – you decide on what variable. You may ﬁnd it helpful to use the fact that 
if a  ≥ b  ≥ 0, then 
a� − �b�

a  − b� ≤ 1 + �
