Problem 1.  A real number r  is called sensible  if  there exist positive  integers a  and b  such 
√
2  is sensible. Prove that 
that  a/b  =  r .  For example, setting a  = 2  and b  = 1  shows that 
2  is not sensible.  (Consider only positive real roots in this problem)

Problem 2.  Translate the following sentence into a predicate formula: 

There  is  a  student  who  has  e­mailed  exactly  two  other  people  in  the  class, 
besides possibly herself. 

The domain of discourse  should be  the  set of  students  in  the  class;  in addition,  the only 
predicates that you may use are equality and E (x,  y), meaning that “x  has sent e­mail to 
y .” 

Problem  3.  Express  each  of  the  following  predicates  and  propositions  in  formal  logic 
notation. The domain of discourse is the nonnegative integers, N. 
In addition to the propositional operators, variables and quantiﬁers, you may deﬁne pred­
icates using addition, multiplication, and equality symbols, but no constants (like 0, 1, . . . ). 
For example, the proposition “n is an even number ” could be written 
∃m.  (m   +  m  =  n). 

(a)  n  is the sum of three perfect squares.

Since  the  constant  0  is  not  allowed  to  appear  explicitly,  the  predicate  “x  = 0”  can’t  be 
written directly, but note that it could be expressed in a simple way as: 

x +  x =  x. 

Then the predicate x > y could be expressed 
∃w
. (y +  w =  x) ∧ (w = 0).

Note  that we’ve used “w =�
0”  in  this  formula,  even  though  it’s  technically not allowed. 
0”  is  equivalent  to  the  allowed  formula  “ ¬(w +  w  =  w),”  we  can  use 
But  since  “w  =�
“w =�
0” with  the understanding  that  it  abbreviates  the  real  thing.  And now  that we’ve 
shown how to express “x > y”, it’s ok to use it too. 

(b)  x > 1. 

(c)  n is a prime number. 

(d)  n is a product of two distinct primes. 

(e)  There is no largest prime number. 

(f)  (Goldbach  Conjecture)  Every  even  natural  number  n  >  2  can  be  expressed  as  the 
sum of two primes. 

(g)  (Bertrand’s  Postulate)  If  n  >  1,  then  there  is  always  at  least  one  prime  p such  that 
n < p < 2n. 

Problem 4.  If a set, A, is ﬁnite, then |A < 2|A|  = 
|P (A)|
| 
, and so there is no surjection from 
set A to its powerset.  Show that this is still true if A is inﬁnite.  Hint:  Remember Russell’s 
paradox and consider {x ∈ A x /∈ f (x)} where f is such a surjection.

Problem 5.  (a)  Prove that 
∃z . [P (z ) ∧ Q(z )]   −→  [∃x. P (x

) ∧ ∃y . Q(y)]  

(1)

is valid.  (Use the proof in the subsection on Validity in Week 2 Notes as a guide to writing 
your own proof here.) 

(b)  Prove that the converse of (1) is not valid by describing a counter model as in Week 
2 Notes.

Problem 6.  (a)  Give an example where the following result fails: 

False Theorem.  For sets A, B , C , and D , let 
L  ::=  (A  ∪ C ) × (B  ∪ D),  
R  ::=  (A  × B ) ∪ (C   × D).  

Then L  =  R. 

(b)  Identify the mistake in the following proof of the False Theorem. 
Bogus proof.  Since L  and R  are both sets of pairs, it’s sufﬁcient to prove that (x,  y) ∈ L 
(x,  y)  ∈ R  for all x,  y . 
The proof will be a chain of iff implications: 
(x,  y)  ∈ L 
x  ∈ A  ∪ C  and y  ∈ B  ∪ D , 
either x   ∈ A  or x  ∈ C , and either y   ∈ B  or y  ∈ D , 
(x  ∈ A  and y  ∈ B ) or else (x  ∈ C  and y  ∈ D), 
(x,  y)  ∈ A  × B , or (x,  y)  ∈ C  × D , 
(x,  y)  ∈ (A  × B ) ∪ (C  × D) =  R.
