Solutions to Problem Set 2 

Problem  1.  Use  induction  to  prove  that  the  following  inequality  holds  for  all  integers 
n  ≥ 1. 

1 3 5 · · · (2n  +  1)  
·
·
2 4 6 · · · (2n  +  2)  
·
·

≥ 

1
2n  +  2 

Solution.  We use induction. Let P (n) be the proposition that: 

1 3 5 · · · (2n  +  1)  
·
·
2 4 6 · · · (2n  +  2)  
·
·

≥ 

1
2n  +  2 

First, we prove P (0).  In this case, both side of the inequality are equal to 1/2, and so the 
inequality holds. Next, for each n  ≥ 0, we must show that P (n) implies P (n + 1). Assume 
that P (n) is true. Then we can reason as follows: 

1 3 5 · · · (2n  +  1)(2n  +  3)  
·
·
2 4 6 · · · (2n  +  2)(2n  +  4)

· 

2n  +  3 
2n  +  4

>

2n  +  2 
1 
2n  +  4 

The  ﬁrst  step  uses  the  induction  hypothesis,  P (n).  The  second  step  uses  the  fact  that 
(2n  +  3)/(2n  +  2)  >  1  for all n  ≥  1.  Therefore, by induction,  the proposition P (n) is true 
for all n   ≥ 1, and the claim is proved.

Problem 2.  This term in 6.042, we’re constantly trying to divide a class of n students into 
groups of either 4 or 5 students. 

(a)  Let’s try to use strong induction prove that a class with n ≥ 8  students can be divided 
into groups of 4 or 5. 

Proof.  The proof is by strong induction. Let P (n) be the proposition that a recitation with 
n students can be divided into teams of 4 or 5. 
First, we  prove  that  P (n)  is  true  for  n  = 8,  9,  or  10  by  showing  how  to  break  classes  of 
these sizes into groups of 4 or 5 students: 

8  =  4  +  4 
9  =  4  +  5 
10  = 5  +  5 
Next, we must show that P (8), . . . , P (n) imply P (n +  1)  for all n  ≥  10.  Thus, we assume 
that P (8), . . . , P (n)  are all  true and show how  to divide up a class of n +  1  students  into 
groups of 4 or 5. We ﬁrst form one group of 4 students. Then we can divide the remaining 
n − 3  students into groups of 4 or 5 by the assumption P (n − 3). This proves P (n + 1), and 
so the claim holds by induction. 

This  proof  contains  a  critical  logical  error.  (In  fact,  the  claim  is  false!)  Identify  the  ﬁrst 
sentence in the proof that does not follow and explain what went wrong. 

Solution.  The ﬁrst error is in the sentence: 
Then we  can divide  the  remaining  n − 3  students  into  groups  of  4  or  5  by  the 
assumption P (n − 3). 
If n  =  10, then P (n − 3)  =  P (7), which is not among our assumptions P (8), . . . , P (n).  In 
� 
this case, P (n +  1)  =  P (11)  is actually false. 

(b)  Provide  a  correct  strong  induction  proof  that  a  class  with  n  ≥  12  students  can  be 
divided into groups of 4 or 5. 

Solution.  The proof  is by strong  induction.  Let P (n)   be  the proposition  that a recitation 
with n students can be divided into teams of 4 or 5. 
First, we prove that P (n) is true for n =  12, 13, 14, and 15 by showing how to break classes 
of these sizes into groups of 4 or 5 students:

12  =  4 + 4 + 4 
13  =  4 + 4 + 5 
14  =  4 + 5 + 5 
15  =  5 + 5 + 5 
Next, we must show that P (12), . . . , P (n) imply P (n + 1) for all n ≥ 15. Thus, we assume 
that P (12), . . . , P (n) are all true and show how to divide up a class of n + 1 students. We 
ﬁrst form one group of 4 students.  Then we can divide the remaining n − 3 students into 
groups of 4 or 5 by the assumption P (n − 3).  (Note that n  ≥  15  and so n − 3 ≥  12;  thus, 
P (n − 3)  is  among  our  assumptions  P (12), . . . , P (n).)  This  proves  P (n + 1),  and  so  the 
� 
claim holds by induction. 

Problem 3.  The game of Mini­nim  is deﬁned as  follows:  Some positive number of sticks 
are placed on the ground. Two players take turns removing one, two, or three sticks. The 
player to remove the last one loses. 
Use strong induction to show that: 
The second player has a winning strategy  if  the number of sticks,  equals 4k + 1 for some k  ∈  N; 
otherwise, the ﬁrst player has a winning strategy. 
Solution.  The induction hypothesis, P (n), is: 
If n  =  4k + 1, for some k ∈  N,  then the second player has a winning strategy; 
otherwise, the ﬁrst player has a winning strategy. 

We proceed by strong induction, starting from 1. 
Base case:  n  =  1.  The ﬁrst player has no choice but  to remove 1 stick and  lose, which  is

what the theorem says for this case.

Strong  inductive  step:  Suppose  the  theorem  is  true  for numbers  1 through n and  show

that it is true for n + 1.  For the inductive step, there are four cases: 

•  n + 1 =  4k + 1:  show that the ﬁrst player loses. We’ve already handled the base case 
(1) so we can assume n + 1 ≥  5.  Consider what the ﬁrst player might do to win:  he 
can choose to remove 1, 2 or 3 sticks.  If he removes one stick, the remaining number 
of  sticks  is  n  = 4k .  By  strong  induction,  the  player  who  plays  at  this  point  has  a 
winning strategy.  So the player who played ﬁrst will lose. 
Similarly, if the ﬁrst player removes two sticks, the remaining number is 4(k − 1) + 3. 
Again, he loses, by the same reasoning.  Similarly, by removing 3 sticks, he loses. So, 
however the ﬁrst player moves, he loses.

•  n  + 1 =  4k :  show that the ﬁrst player can win. 
Have the ﬁrst player remove 3 sticks:  the second player then sees 4(k − 1) + 1 sticks, 
and loses, by the strong inductive hypothesis. 

•  n  + 1 =  4k  + 2:  show that the ﬁrst player can win. 
Have the ﬁrst player remove 1 stick:  the second player then sees 4k  + 1 sticks, and 
loses as in the previous case. 

•  n  + 1 =  4k  + 3:  show that the ﬁrst player can win. 
Have the ﬁrst player remove 2 sticks:  again, the second player sees 4k + 1 sticks and 
loses. 

So in any case, P (n  + 1) is true, and by strong induction, we conclude that P (n) holds for 
all n  ≥ 1.

Problem 4.  Consider the following equivalent way of viewing the subset take­away game 
from the in­class problem on Friday, Week 2:  for a ﬁxed, ﬁnite set, A, let S initially be all 
the  proper  subsets  of  A.  Players  alternately  choose  a  set  B  ∈ S and  remove  B  and  all 
sets that contain B  from S ; they then continue playing on the updated S .  The player that 
chooses the last set in S wins. 

(a)  Use  the well­ordering property  to  show  that,  in  any  game,  one  of  the players must 
have a winning strategy. Hint: Consider games whose initial set, S , is an arbitrary collec­
tion of subsets of, A, not necessarily all the proper subsets of A.  Reach a contradiction by 
considering a minimum size game with no winning strategy for either player.  What is a 
useful measure of size of a game? 

Solution.  Let S  be the smallest collection such that neither player has a winning strategy. 
Consider the state after each possible ﬁrst move by player 1. No such state can correspond 
to a winning position for player 1 since that would mean a winning strategy for player 1 
on S .  Nor can every such state be a winning position for player 2 since that would mean 
player 2 has a winning strategy on S . Hence, at least one such state must have no winning 
strategies  for  both  players.  But  this  state  is  a  smaller  collection  than  S ,  contradiction. 
Thus, by the W.O.P, some player must have a winning strategy for any collection S , and 
� 
for the proper subsets of A  in particular. 

(b)  If the whole set A  is a possible move in a game, explain why the 1st player must have 
a winning strategy.

Solution.  We reason by cases to show that player 1 has a winning strategy. Suppose game 
G  includes A  as a possible move.  Let G�  be the same game as G  except that A  is removed 
from the set of possible moves. 
Case 1:  Player 1 has a winning strategy in the game G� .  Then the ﬁrst move of Player 1’s 
winning strategy will also be a legal move in game G. Moreover, after this move in game 
G, the set A  will no longer be a possible move, so the move will lead to the same winning 
situation for Player 1 as in game G� .  So Player 1 has a winning strategy in this case. 
Case 2: Player 2 has a winning strategy in game G� . Then player 1 should choose A  as his 
ﬁrst move  in  game G.  This  puts  him  in  the  position  of  the  Player  2  in  game G� ,  and  so 
Player 1 will have a winning strategy in this case as well. 
So in any case, we conclude that Player 1 has a winning strategy —even though we don’t 
� 
have a clue what it is.
