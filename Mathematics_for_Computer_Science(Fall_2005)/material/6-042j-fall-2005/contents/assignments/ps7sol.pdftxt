Solutions to Problem Set 7 

Problem 1.  There are 20 books arranged in a row on a shelf. 

(a)  Describe a bijection between ways of choosing 6 of these books so that no two adja­
cent books are selected and 15­bit sequences with exactly 6 ones. 
Solution.  There  is  a  bijection  from  15­bit  sequences  with  exactly  six  1’s  to  valid  book 
selections:  given such a sequence, map each zero  to a non­chosen book,  each of  the ﬁrst 
ﬁve 1’s to a chosen book followed by a non­chosen book, and the last 1 to a chosen book. 
For example, here is a conﬁguration of books and the corresponding binary sequence:

Selected  books  are  darkened.  Notice  that  the  ﬁrst  ﬁves  ones  are  mapped  to  a  chosen 
book and an non­chosen book in order to ensure that the binary sequence maps to a valid 
� 
selection of books. 

(b)  How  many  ways  are  there  to  select  6  books  so  that  no  two  adjacent  books  are  se­
lected?

Solution.  By  the Bijection Rule,  this  is equal  to  the number of 15­bit  sequences with ex­
actly 6 ones, which is equal to

Problem  2.  Answer  the  following  questions  and  provide  brief  justiﬁcations.  Not  every 
problem  can be  solved with  a  cute  formula;  you may have  to  fall back on  case  analysis, 
explicit enumeration, or ad hoc methods. 
You may leave factorials and binomial coefﬁcients in your answers. 

(a)  In how many different ways  can  the  letters  in  the name of  the popular  1980’s band 
BAN  AN ARAM   A  be arranged? 

Solution.  There  are  5 A’s,  2 N ’s,  1 B ,  1 R,  and  1 M .  Therefore,  the  number  of  arrange­
ments is 

by the Bookkeeper Rule.

(b)  How many  different  paths  are  there  from  point  (0,  0,  0)  to  point  (12,  24,  36)   if  every 
step increments one coordinate and leaves the other two unchanged? 

Solution.  There  is  a  bijection  between  the  set  of  all  such  paths  and  the  set  of  strings 
containing 12 X’s, 24 Y’s, and 36 Z’s.  In particular, we obtain a path by working through a 
string from left to right.  An X  corresponds to a step that increments the ﬁrst coordinate, 
a Y  increments the second coordinate, and a Z  increments the third.  The number of such 
strings is: 

72!  
12!   24!  36!  
Therefore, this is also the number of paths. 

(c)  In how many different ways can 2n  students be paired up? 

Solution.  Pair up students by the following procedure. Line up the students and pair the 
ﬁrst and  second,  the  third and  fourth,  the ﬁfth and  sixth,  etc.  The  students  can be  lined 
up  in  (2n)!  ways.  However,  this overcounts by a  factor of 2n ,  because we would get  the 
same  pairing  if  the  ﬁrst  and  second  students were  swapped,  the  third  and  fourth were 
swapped, etc.  Furthermore, we are still overcounting by a factor of n!, because we would 
get  the  same  pairing  even  if  pairs  of  students were  permuted,  e.g.  the  ﬁrst  and  second 
were swapped with the ninth and tenth. Therefore, the number of pairings is: 

(2n)!

(d)  How many  different  solutions  over  the  natural  numbers  are  there  to  the  following 
equation? 

x1  +  x2  +  x3  +  . . . +  x8  =  100 
A solution is a speciﬁcation of the value of each variable xi . Two solutions are different if 
different values are speciﬁed for some variable xi . 

Solution.  There is a bijection between sequences containing 100 zeros and 7 ones.  Specif­
ically,  the  7  ones  divide  the  zeros  into  8  segments.  Let  xi  be  the  number  of  zeros  in  the 
�

i­th segment. Therefore, the number of solutions is: 
100  +  7

(e)  In how many different ways  can one  choose n out of  2n objects,  given  that n of  the 
2n objects are identical and the other n are all unique? 

Solution.  We  can  select  n  objects  as  follows.  First,  take  a  subset  of  the  unique  objects. 
Then  take however many  identical elements are needed  to bring  the  total  to n.  The ﬁrst 
step can be done in 2n  ways, and the second can be done in only 1 way.  Therefore, there

are 2n  ways to choose n objects. 

(f)  How  many  undirected  graphs  are  there  with  vertices  v1 , v2 , . . . , vn  if  self­loops  are

(h)  The working days in the next year can be numbered 1, 2, 3, . . . , 300.  I’d like to avoid 
as many as possible. 

•  On even­numbered days, I’ll say I’m sick. 
•  On days that are a multiple of 3, I’ll say I was stuck in trafﬁc. 
•  On days that are a multiple of 5, I’ll refuse to come out from under the blankets. 

In total, how many work days will I avoid in the coming year? 

Solution.  Let D2  be the set of even­numbered days, D3  be the days that are a multiple of 
3, and D5  be days that are a multiple of 5.  The set of days I can avoid is D2  ∪ D3  ∪ D5 .  By 
the Inclusion­Exclusion Rule, the size of this set is:

Problem 3.  Use the pigeonhole principle to solve the following problems. 

(a)  Prove that among any n2 + 1  points within an n× n  square there must exist two points 
√
whose distance is at most 
2. 
Solution.  Partition  the  n  × n  into  n2  unit  squares.  Each  of  the  n2  +  1  points  lies  in  one 
of  these n2  unit  squares.  (If a point  lies on  the boundary between  squares,  assign  it  to a 
√
square  arbitrarily.)  Therefore,  by  the  pigeonhole  principle,  there  exist  two  points  in  the 
� 
same unit square. And the distance between those two points can be at most 
2.

(b)  Jellybeans  of  6  different  ﬂavors  are  stored  in  5  jars.  There  are  11  jellybeans  of  each 
ﬂavor. Prove that some jar contains at least three jellybeans of one ﬂavor and also at least 
three jellybeans of some other ﬂavor. 
Solution. We use the pigeonhole principle twice. Since there are 11 beans of a given ﬂavor 
and  there are only 5  jars,  some  jar must get at  least �11/5�= 3  beans of  that ﬂavor.  Since 
there are 6 ﬂavors and only 5 jars, some jar must get two pairs of same­ﬂavored beans. � 

(c)  Prove that among every set of 30 integers, there exist two whose difference or sum is 
a multiple of 51. 
Solution.  Regard  the 30  integers as pigeons.  Regard  the 26  sets {0},  {1, 50},  {2, 49},  . . ., 
{25, 26} as pigeonholes.  Map integer n to the set containing n  rem  51.  By the pigeonhole 
principle, some two pigeons (integers a and b) are mapped to the same pigeonhole. Thus, 
either: 

•  a  rem  51   =  b rem  51   and so the difference of a and b is a multiple of 51. 
•  a  rem  51   +  b rem  51  is either 0 or 51 and so the sum of a and b is a multiple of 51.

Problem 4.  Suppose you have seven dice— each a different color of  the rainbow; other­
wise the dice are standard, with six faces numbered 1 to 6. A roll is a sequence specifying 
a value for each die in rainbow (ROYGBIV) order. For example, one roll is (3, 1, 6, 1, 4, 5, 2)  
indicating  that  the red die showed a 3,  the orange die showed 1,  the yellow 6,  the green 
1, the blue 4, the indigo 5, and the violet 2. 
For the problems below, describe a bijection between the speciﬁed set of rolls and another 
set that is easily counted using the Product, Generalized Product, and similar rules. Then 
write  a  simple  numerical  expression  for  the  size  of  the  set  of  rolls.  You  do  not  need  to 
prove  that  the  correspondence  between  sets  you  describe  is  a  bijection,  and  you  do  not 
need to simplify the expression you come up with. 
For  example,  let  A be  the  set  of  rolls where  4  dice  come  up  showing  the  same  number, 
and the other 3 dice also come up the same, but with a different number.  Let R to be the 
set of seven rainbow colors and S be the set {1, . . . , 6} of dice values. 
Deﬁne B ::=  S2  × {3, 4} × R3 , where S2  is  the set of size 2 subsets of S , and R3  is  the set 
of size 3 subsets of R.  Then deﬁne a bijection  from A to B by mapping a roll  in A to  the 
sequence in B whose ﬁrst element is the set of two numbers that came up, whose second 
element  is  the number of  times  the  smaller of  the  two numbers came up  in  the  roll,  and 
whose third element is the set of colors of the three matching dice. 

Solutions to Problem Set 7 

For example, the roll 

(4, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4)  ∈ A 

maps to the triple 

({2, 4} , 3, {yellow,green,indigo}) ∈ B .

(a)  For how many rolls is the value on every die different? 

Solution.  None, by the Pigeonhole Principle. 

6 

� 

(b)  For how many rolls do two dice have the value 6 and the remaining ﬁve dice all have 
different values? 
Example:  (6, 2, 6, 1, 3, 4, 5)  is  a  roll  of  this  type,  but  (1, 1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 5)  and  (6, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 4)  
are not. 
Solution.  As  in  the  example,  map  a  roll  into  an  element  of  B ::=  R2  × P5  where  P5  is 
the  set  of  permutations  of  {1, . . . , 5}.  A  roll maps  to  the  pair whose  ﬁrst  element  is  the 
set  of  colors  of  the  two  dice  with  value  6,  and  whose  second  element  is  the  sequence 
of  values  of  the  remaining  dice  (in  rainbow  order).  So  (6, 2, 6, 1, 3, 4, 5)  above  maps  to 
�  � 
({red,yellow} , (2, 1, 3, 4, 5)). By the Product rule,

7 
5!.

B | =

(c)  For how many rolls do two dice have the same value and the remaining ﬁve dice all 
have different values? 
Example:  (4, 2, 4, 1, 3, 6, 5)  is  a  roll  of  this  type,  but  (1, 1, 2, 6, 1, 4, 5)  and  (6, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 4)  
are not. 

Solution.  Map a roll  into a  triple whose ﬁrst element  is  in S ,  indicating  the value of  the 
pair of matching dice, whose second element is set of colors of the two matching dice, and 
whose third element is the sequence of the remaining ﬁve dice values (in rainbow order). 
So (4, 2, 4, 1, 3, 6, 5)  above maps to (4, {red,yellow} , (2, 1, 3, 6, 5)).  Notice that the number 
of choices for the third element of a triple is the number of permutations of the remaining 

Solutions to Problem Set 7

ﬁve values, namely, 5!. This mapping is a bijection, so the number of such rolls equals the 
�  � 
number of such triples. By the Generalized Product rule, the number of such triples is

· 
7 
5!.

6 

Alternatively, we  can deﬁne  a map  from  this  rolls  in  this part  to  the  rolls  in part  (b),  by 
replacing the value of the duplicated values with 6’s and replacing any 6 in the remaining 
values by  the value of  the duplicated pair.  So  the roll (4, 2, 4, 1, 3, 6, 5)  would map  to  the 
role  (6, 2, 6, 1, 3, 4, 5).  Now  a  type  b  role,  r ,  is mapped  to  by  exactly  the  rolls  obtainable 
from r by exchanging occurrences of 6’s and i’s, for i = 1, . . . , 6.  So this map is 6­to­1, and 
by the Division Rule, the number of rolls here is 6 times the number of rolls in part (b). 
� 

(d)  For  how many  rolls  do  two  dice  have  one  value,  two  different  dice  have  a  second 
value, and the remaining three dice a third value? 
Example:  (6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 6, 6)  is  a  roll  of  this  type,  but  (4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 5)  and  (5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 1, 2)  
are not. 

Solution.  Map a roll of this kind into a 4­tuple whose ﬁrst element is the set of two num­
bers  of  the  two  pairs  of  matching  dice,  whose  second  element  is  the  set  of  two  colors 
of  the  pair  of matching  dice with  the  smaller  number,  whose  third  element  is  the  set  of 
two  colors  of  the  larger  of  the  matching  pairs,  and  whose  fourth  element  is  the  value 
� � 
� � 
� � 
of  the  remaining  three  dice.  For  example,  the  roll  (6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 6, 6)  maps  to  the  triple

Problem 5.  A derangement is a permutation (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) of the set {1, 2, . . . , n} such that 
xi  =�
i for all i.  For example, (2, 3, 4, 5, 1)  is a derangement, but (2, 1, 3, 5, 4)  is not because 
3 appears in the third position. The objective of this problem is to count derangements.

It turns out to be easier to start by counting the permutations that are not derangements. 
Let  Si  be  the  set  of  all  permutations  (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )  that  are  not  derangements  because 
n
 
xi  =  i.  So the set of non­derangements is 
Si . 
i=1 

(a)  What is |Si ?|
Solution.  There is a bijection between permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n} with i in the i­th po­
sition and unrestricted permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n} − i. Therefore,  Si = (n − 1)!.

(b)  What is  Si  ∩ Sj where i =  j ? 
|
Solution.  The set Si  ∩ Sj  consists of all permutations with  i in  the  i­th position and  j in 
the j ­th position. Thus, there is a bijection with permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n} − {i, j }, and 
so  Si  ∩ Sj = (n − 2)!.
