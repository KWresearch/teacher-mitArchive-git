Solutions to Problem Set 6


Problem  1.  You’ve  seen  how  the  RSA  encryption  scheme  works,  but  why  is  it  hard  to 
break?  In  this  problem,  you  will  see  that  ﬁnding  secret  keys  is  as  hard  as  ﬁnding  the 
prime factorizations of integers.  Since there is a general consensus in the crypto commu­
nity  (enough  to  persuade  many  large  ﬁnancial  institutions,  for  example)  that  factoring 
numbers with  a  few hundred digits  requires  astronomical  computing  resources, we  can 
therefore be sure it will take the same kind of overwhelming effort to ﬁnd RSA secret keys 
of  a  few  hundred  digits.  This means we  can  be  conﬁdent  the  private  RSA  keys  are  not 
somehow revealed by the public keys 1 
For  this  problem,  assume  that  n  =  p  · q  where  p,  q  are  both  odd  primes  and  that  e  is  the 
public  key  and  d  the  secret  key  of  the  RSA  protocol  as  described  in Week  6 Notes.  Let 
x  ::=   e d   − 1.

(a)  Show that φ(n) divides x. 
Solution.  ed  ≡  1  (mod  φ)(n) by deﬁnition of d, so φ(n) divides x  by deﬁnition of ≡ mod

φ(n). 

(b)  Conclude that 4 divides x. 
Solution.  Since p,   q   are odd, both p − 1  and q − 1  are even. Thus 4  divides (p − 1)(q − 1)   =

φ(n), so by part (a), 4 also divides x.

1This is a very weak kind of “security” property, because it doesn’t even rule out the possibility of deci­
phering RSA encoded messages by some method that did not require knowing the secret key. Nevertheless, 
oveer twenty years experience supports the security of RSA in practice.

A  square  root  of m modulo  n is  a  nonnegative  integer  s < n such  that  s ≡  m (mod  n). 
2
Here  is a nice  fact  to know:  when n is a product of  two odd primes,  then every number 
m such that gcd(m, n)  = 1   has 4 square roots modulo n. 
In particular, the number 1 has four square roots modulo n. The two trivial ones are 1 and 
n − 1  (which is ≡ −1  (mod  n)). The other two are called the nontrivial square roots of 1. 

(d)	 Since you know x, then for any integer, r , you can also compute the remainder, y , of 
2  ≡ rx
rx/2  divided by n.  So y
(mod  n).  Now  if r is relatively prime to n,  then y will be a 
square root of 1 modulo n by part (c). 
Show that if y turns out to be a nontrivial root of 1 modulo n, then you can factor n.  Hint: 
From the fact that y − 1  = (y +  1)(y − 1), show that y +  1  must be divisible by exactly one 
2
of q and p. 
Solution.  Since  y is a  square  root of 1 modulo n, we know  that n divides  y − 1  = (y + 
2
1)(y − 1).  So p must divide either y +  1  or y − 1, and likewise q must divide either y +  1   or 
y − 1.

But  if  y is  nontrivial,  then  y +  1   and  y − 1  are positive  and  smaller  than  n,  so  if  y +  1  is

divisible by p it can’t also be divisible by q , and likewise, if it is divisible by q it can’t also 

be  divisible  by  p.  So  y +  1  must  be  divisible  by  exactly  one  of  p and  q .  So  gcd(y +  1, n)

must equal p or q . 

(e)  It  turns  out  that  at  least half  the positive  integers  r < n that  are  relatively prime  to 
n will yield y ’s in part (d) that are nontrivial roots of 1.  Conclude that if, in addition to n 
and the public key, e, you also knew  the secret key d,  then you can be sure of being able 
to factor n. 

Solution.  Keep choosing r’s at random. Most r’s wil be relatively prime to n and at least 
half of these will yield nontrivial y ’s in part (d), so you can be sure to turn up the needed 
� 
nontrivial y in not very many tries. 

Problem 2.  The Massachusetts Turnpike Authority is concerned about the integrity of the 
new Zakim bridge.  Their consulting architect has warned that the bridge may collapse if 
more  than  1000  cars  are on  it  at  the  same  time.  The Authority has  also been warned by 
their  trafﬁc  consultants  that  the  rate  of  accidents  from  cars  speeding  across  bridges  has 
been increasing. 
Both  to  lighten  trafﬁc  and  to  discourage  speeding,  the  Authority  has  decided  to  make 
the  bridge  one­way  and  to  put  tolls  at  both  ends  of  the  bridge  (don’t  laugh,  this  is Mas­
sachusetts).  So  cars will  pay  tolls  both  on  entering  and  exiting  the  bridge,  but  the  tolls 

Solutions to Problem Set 6 

3 

will be different.  In particular, a car will pay $3  to enter onto  the bridge and will pay $2 
to  exit.  To  be  sure  that  there  are  never  too many  cars  on  the  bridge,  the Authority will 
let a car onto the bridge only if the difference between the amount of money currently at 
the  entry  toll booth minus  the amount at  the  exit  toll booth  is  strictly  less  than a  certain 
threshold amount of $T0 . 
The  consultants  have  decided  to model  this  scenario with  a  state machine whose  states 
are triples of natural numbers, (A, B , C ), where 

•  A is an amount of money at the entry booth, 

•  B is an amount of money at the exit booth, and 

•  C is a number of cars on the bridge. 

Any  state with C >  1000   is  called  a  collapsed  state, which  the Authority dearly hopes  to 
avoid. There will be no transition out of a collapsed state. 
Since the toll booth collectors may need to start off with some amount of money in order 
to  make  change,  and  there  may  also  be  some  number  of  “ofﬁcial”  cars  already  on  the 
bridge  when  it  is  opened  to  the  public,  the  consultants  must  be  ready  to  analyze  the 
system  started at  any  state.  So  let A0  be  the  initial number of dollars at  the entrance  toll 
booth, B0  the initial number of dollars at the exit toll booth, and C0  the number of ofﬁcial 
cars  on  the  bridge when  it  is  opened.  The Authority will  be  careful  to  ensure  that C0  is 
not large enough to cause a collapse.  You should assume that even ofﬁcial cars pay tolls 
on exiting or entering the bridge after the bridge is opened. 

(a)  Give a mathematical model of the Authority’s system for  letting cars on and off  the 
bridge by specifying a transition relation between states of the form (A, B , C ) above. 

Solution.  State (A, B , C ) goes to state 
(i)	 (A + 3, B , C + 1), provided that A − B < T0  and C < 1000. This transition models the 
case where a car enters the bridge. 
(ii)	 (A, B +  2, C − 1), provided that 0  < C ≤ 1000. This transition models the case where 
a car leaves the bridge.

(b)	 Characterize each of the following derived variables 
A, B , A +  B , A − B , 3C − A, 2A − 3B , B +  3C, 2A − 3B − 6C, 2A − 2B − 3C

and brieﬂy explain your reasoning. 

Solution.  In  every  transition,  at  least  one  of A and B  increases.  So  their  sum  is  strictly 
increasing.  2A − 3B can ﬂuctuate, going up on (i) and down on (ii). 
The difference  3C  − A doesn’t  change under  transitions of  type  (i),  but decreases under 
transitions of  type  (ii);  so  is weakly decreasing.  Likewise, B + 3C  doesn’t change under 
transitions of type (ii), but increases under transitions of type (i); so is weakly increasing. 
On  the other hand, 6C  and 2A − 3B  simultaneously  increase by 6 under  transition  (i) or 
simultaneously decrease by 6 under transition (ii), which makes their difference constant. 
Finally, under (i), 2A increases by 6, B is unchanged, and 3C increases by 3, so 2A−2B−3C  
increases by 6 − 3 =  3.  However, under  (ii), A is unchanged,  3C  decreases by 3 and 2B  
increases by 4, so 2A − 2B − 3C decreases by −(−4) − 3 =  1.

The Authority has asked their engineering consultants to determine T  and to verify that 
this policy will keep the number of cars from exceeding 1000.

The consultants reason that if A0  is the initial number of dollars at the entrance toll booth, 
B0  is  the  initial number  of dollars  at  the  exit  toll  booth,  and C0  is  the number  of  ofﬁcial 
cars on the bridge when it is opened, then an additional 1000  − C0  cars can be allowed on 
the  bridge,  so  as  long  as A − B has  not  increased  by  3(1000  − C0 )  there  shouldn’t more 
than 1000 cars on the bridge.  So they recommend deﬁning 
T0  ::=  3(1000  − C0 ) +  (A0  − B0 ).  

(c)  Use  the results of part  (b)  to deﬁne a simple predicate, P , on states of  the  transition 
system which  is satisﬁed by  the start state,  that  is P (A0 , B0 , C0 )  holds,  is not satisﬁed by 
any  collapsed  state,  and  is  an  invariant  of  the  system.  Verify  that  the  P  you  deﬁne  has 
these properties. 
Solution.  Let D0  ::=  2A0  − 3B0  − 6C0 . 
Invariant:  [2A − 3B − 6C =  D0 ]
∧
[C ≤ 1000].
The  invariant obviously holds at  the state  (A0 , B0 , C0 )  because we know  that C0  ≤ 1000. 
It does not hold in any collapsed state.  To verify the Invariant, assume (A, B , C ) satisﬁes 
the  Invariant  and  has  a  transition  to  (A� , B � , C � ).  We  check  that  (A� , B � , C � )  satisﬁes  the 
Invariant by considering the two kinds of transitions. 
Transition (i) (a car enters the bridge):  so 
6C �  = 6(C +  1)  = 6C +  6  = (2A − 3B − D0 ) +  6  = 2(A +  3) − 3B − D0  = 2A�  − 3B �  − D0 , 
which implies that 

2A�  − 3B �  − 6C �  =  D0 , 

(1) 

(by (1)) 

as required. 
Also, the transition is possible only if A − B < T0 . But this implies 
6C �  = 2A�  − 3B �  − D0 
= 2(A�  − B � ) − B �  − D0 
=  2((A +  3) − B ) − B − D0 
= 2(A − B ) − B − D0  +  6 
≤ 2(A − B ) − B0  − D0  +  6 
≤ 2(T0  − 1)  − B0  − D0  +  6 
=  2[3(1000   − C0 ) +  (A0  − B0 )]   − B0  − D0  +  4 
=  6000  − 6C0  +  2A0  − 3B0  − D0  +  4 
=  6004, 
and so C �  ≤ �6004/6� =  1000, as required. 
Transition (ii) (a car leaves the bridge):  so 
6C �  = 6(C − 1)  = 6C − 6  = 2A − 3B − 6  = 2A − 3(B +  3)   = 2A�  − 3B � . 
In addition, C �  < C ≤ 1000   so C �  ≤ 1000.

(d)  A  clever MIT  intern working  for  the Turnpike Authority  agrees  that  the Turnpike’s 
bridge management  policy will  be  safe:  the  bridge will  not  collapse.  But  she warns  her 
boss  that  the  policy  will  lead  to  deadlock—  a  situation  where  trafﬁc  can’t  move  on  the 
bridge even though the bridge has not collapsed. 
Explain more precisely in terms of system transitions what the intern means, and brieﬂy, 
but clearly, justify her claim. 

Solution.  The intern means that any sequence of transitions will arrive at a state in which 
no  transition  is possible,  even  though  there  are no  cars on  the bridge.  This happens be­
cause every time a car enters and then exits the bridge the value of A  − B  increases by 1. 
So after 3000 cars have crossed the bridge, no further car can enter the bridge because 
A  − B  ≥ 3000   +  A0  − B0  ≥ 3(1000  − C0 ) +  (A0  − B0 ) =  T0 . 

After that, cars can only exit the bridge. So after at most 3000+1000 transitions, the system 
� 
deadlocks with the bridge empty but no cars allowed onto the bridge. 

Problem  3.  Vertices  u,  v  in  a  digraph  are  said  to  be  unconnected  when  there  is  no  path 
either from u  to v  or from v  to u. The following procedure can be applied to any digraph, 
G:

Pick two vertices u,   v  such that either


1.  there is an edge (u,   v) of G  and there is also a path from u  to v  which does not include 
this edge; in this case, delete the edge (u,  v), or 

2.  u  and v  are unconnected; in this case, add the edge (u,  v). 

Repeat  these  operations  until  it  is  no  longer  possible  to  ﬁnd  vertices  u,  v  to  which  an 
operation applies. 
This  procedure  can  be modelled  as  a  state machine.  The  start  state  is  G,  and  the  states 
are all possible digraphs with the same vertices as G.  The ﬁnal states are the digraphs on 
which no operation is possible. 

(a)  For any state, G, let e  be its number of edges, and p its number of pairs of unconnected 
vertices. Deﬁne a decreasing natural number valued derived variable that is a function of 
e  and p. Conclude that the procedure terminates started on any ﬁnite digraph, G. 
Solution.  Let G  be  a  state  and G�  be  the  resulting  state  after  a  transition.  We  show  this 
derived variable is strictly decreasing by showing 2p  +  e  of G�  is less than 2p  +  e  of G. 

Solutions to Problem Set 6 
7 
Suppose G�  is the result of the ﬁrst transition. Clearly, e  decreases by 1. Thus, all we need 
to show is that p  never increases (we do not care if it decreases or remains the same). We 
show this by showing  if two arbitrary vertices u  and v  are connected  in G,  then they are 
connected  in  G� .  Consider  the  connected  vertices  u  and  v .  Call  the  deleted  edge  x  − y 
going from some vertex x  to some vertex y . The only way for u  and v  to not be connected 
in G�  is  if all paths between  the vertices contain  the edge x  − y .  However,  this cannot be 
because for each path containing x  − y ,  there is also a path containing the alternate path 
from x  to y  that we know must exist (by the condition which we deleted x  − y ). 
Now  suppose  G�  is  the  result  of  the  second  transition.  Clearly,  adding  an  edge  cannot 
cause  two vertices  that were previously  connected  to become unconnected.  By  the  con­
dition  stated  in  the  transition,  we  know we  have  connected  two  vertices  that were  pre­
viously unconnected.  Thus,  because no pairs of  connected vertices may become uncon­
nected,  and  because we  know  of  a  pair  of  vertices  that were  unconnected  are  becoming 
connected, we can conclude p  decreases by at least one, so 2p  decreases by at least 2.  Yet, 
� 
e  only increases by exactly 1. Thus, in this case, 2p  +  e  is decreasing as well. 

(b)  Prove that the set of ﬁnal states reachable from DAG start states are the line graphs. 

Solution.  First, we observe every line graph is a ﬁnal state. This follows because there are 
no pairs of unconnected vertices and there is some path between every pair of vertices. 
Second,  we  show  that  if  a  digraph  is  not  a  line  graph,  there  must  be  some  transition 
possible.  If  some  pair  of  vertices  are  not  connected,  then  a  transition  is  possible,  so we 
may assume all are connected.  Suppose there is a vertex, u, with out­degree at least two. 
So u  has edges going to v  =� w .  But v  and w  are connected, so without  loss of generality, 
we may  assume  a  path  goes  from  w  to  v .  But  then  a  transition  removing  edge  (u,  v)  is 
possible.  A  similar argument  shows  that a  transition  is possible  if  there  is a vertex with 
in­degree at least two.  So every vertex has out­degree and in­degree at most 1 and every 
pair  of  vertices  is  connected.  This  implies  the  graph  is  a  line  graph,  as  the  reader may 
� 
verify. 

(c)  Prove that the property of being a DAG is an invariant of this procedure. 

Solution.  To show the property of being a DAG is invariant, we show if G  is a DAG, and 
G�  is the result of applying one of the two operations 1 and 2 described above to G, then 
G�  is a DAG. 
So suppose G�  is the result of applying operation 1.  Since removing an edge cannot create 
a cycle, G�  remains a DAG. 
Next,  suppose G�  is  the result of applying operation 2.  We prove G�  is acyclic by contra­
diction. Assume some cycle exists. The edge (u,  v) must be an edge in the cycle, otherwise 
the  cycle would have  existed  in G  as well.  Let u  be  the  start vertex of  the  cycle  (we  can 
pick the start vertex arbitrarily from any vertices in the cycle).  Let the ﬁrst edge be (u,  v). 

Solutions to Problem Set 6 

8 

Note  there must be  a path  from  v  to u  to  complete  the  cycle,  thus  there must have been 
a path from v  to u in the graph G.  This contradicts the condition on which we added an 
� 
edge from u to v . 

(d)  Prove  that  if  G is  a  DAG,  the  procedure  terminates  with  a  line  graph  whose  path 
relation is a topological sort of the partial order deﬁned by G.  Hint:  Strengthen the DAG 
invariant in the previous part. 

Solution.  The  invariant  is  that  the  current  DAG  is  a  reﬁnement  of  the  starting  DAG, 
where relation R2  is a reﬁnement of relation R1  iff they have the same domain and codomain, 
� 
and xR1y implies xR2y for all x, y . 

Problem 4.  (a)  Give an example of a stable match between 3 boys and 3 girls where no 
person gets their ﬁrst choice. 

Solution.  Call the boys 1, 2, 3  and the girls a, b, c. Consider the following preference list: 

choice  1st  2nd  3rd 
1 
a 
b 
c 
a 
c 
b 
2 
3 
c

a

3 
1 
2 
1 
3 
b 
c 
1 
2 
3 

The matching (1, b), (2, c), (3, a) is stable even though no person gets their ﬁrst choice. 
To  see  the  intuition  behind  this  solution,  notice  ﬁrst  that  the  ﬁrst  choice  of  any  boy  has 
that boy as her last choice and vice versa. Second, notice that everyone ends up with their 
second choice. 
Since we show a pairing where everyone has their second choice, this is stable because the 
only way to have a rogue pair is for a boy or girl to want their ﬁrst choice, but their ﬁrst 
choice always likes them least so will never want to leave their current partner. Therefore, 
� 
we end up with a stable pairing where no one gets their ﬁrst choice. 

(b)  Describe a simple procedure to determine whether or not a stable marriage problem 
has a unique solution, that is, only one possible stable marriage assignment. 

Solution.  See  if  the Mating  algorithm  with  Boys  as  suitors  yields  the  same  solution  as 
the algorithm with Girls as suitors. These two marriage assignments are boy­optimal and 
� 
girl­optimal, respectively, so they agree iff there is a unique solution.

Problem  5.  A Harvard  BS  graduates  and  starts with  an  annual  salary  of  $140,000, with 
a $25,000  raise guaranteed  every year.  An MIT SB graduate  starts with $100,000, with a 
guaranteed 15% raise every year. Assume the bankrate is a ﬁxed 3%  per year. That is, the 
bank will pay $1.03 a year from now if you deposit $1.00 today. 

(a)  Suppose  both  graduates  retire  after  the  same  number  of  years.  Use  the  fact  that 
x  =  o((1  +  �)x ) to explain why the MIT SB must come out ahead if they work for enough 
years.  (You should not make use of closed forms for various sums in your explanation.) 
Solution.  The  Harvard  graduate  only  gets  a  ﬁxed  annual  income  raise,  so  his  income 
grows  linearly,  i.e.,  Θ(n)  where  n  is  the  number  of  years  worked.  The  MIT  graduate’s 
raise is based on a certain percentage of his annual income.  Therefore, his income grows 
exponentially,  i.e.,  Θ(1.15n ).  Since  n  =  o(1.15n ), we  conclude  that  the MIT  grad’s  salary 
will  eventually  grow  and  stay  larger  than  the  Harvard  grad’s  by  more  than  any  ﬁxed 
constant factor. But anyway, once we realize his salary stays larger, it’s clear he will even­
tually catch up and then exceed the total salary paid the Harvard grad. The main question 
is whether this will occur in their lifetimes! 
We have not considered the diminished present value of salary paid years from now.  As 
long  the  bankrate,  b,  remains  lower  than  the  1.15  factor  by which  the MIT  grad’s  salary 
increases  annually,  then  the present  value  of  the  year  n  salary  still  grows  exponentially, 
though more slowly than Θ(1.15n ). Namely its growth is Θ((1 + �)n ) where 1 + � ::=  1.15/b. 
So  the  argument  of  the  preceding  paragraph  still  holds.  We  can  safely  assume  the MIT 
grad  is savvy enough not  to accept a  job whose annual percent  increase was  lower  than 
� 
the bankrate. 

(b)  Suppose both graduates retire after n years.  For which values of n is the MIT gradu­
ate’s salary package better that the Harvard grad’s? 
Solution.  One dollar after year i is worth r i  in today’s currency, where

Problem  6.  Books  Books  and  more  Books!  If  the  6.042  staff  is  to  stand  a  chance  at  the 
Book Extension Stacking Challenge, we have to consider all the angles! 
Recall the basic book stacking challenge from the course notes where you have an unlim­
ited supply of books to stack that are all the same weight. 

(a)  What if instead of all books weighing the same, you have a book that weighs 1 pound, 
a book that weighs  1
4  pounds, where each successive book 
2  pounds, a book that weighs  1 
weighs half as much as  the previous book.  Say you had n  such books,  and also  that  the 
you have a duplicate of the lightest book. How far out can you stack the books? Note that 
all books  are  still  the  same  size,  just different weights.  Hint:  Where  should  the heaviest 
books be? 

Solutions to Problem Set 6 

11 

Solution.  The  lightest  books  will  be  on  top.  Notice  that  every  time  you  add  a  heavier 
book to the bottom, it’s weight will equal the weight of all the books already in the stack. 
Thus, you can model this problem as stacking two books of equal weight. 
Every  time  you  add  a  heavier  book  to  the  bottom,  you  can  extend  the  stack  out  by  the 
same constant amount.  The top of the stack will have  its center of gravity at the edge of 
the  new  bottom  book,  and  the whole  stack will  have  its  center  of  gravity  at  the  edge  of 
the table. Thus, the bottom book will stick out 1/4 of its length past the edge of the table. 
� 
Every book you add will add 1/4 of a book length to the extension of the stack! 

(b)  What if you had to stack such that the lightest books were on the bottom of the stack 
and  the  heaviest  books were  on  top  of  the  stack.  How  far  out  can  you  stack  an  inﬁnite 
number of books where each book  is  twice as heavy as  the book below  it (we’re  looking 
for either inﬁnitely far or ﬁnitely far)?  Justify your answer. 

Solution.  Books can only be stacked ﬁnitely far.  Start with the original book of weight 1. 
Note that this book weighs as much as the rest of the books combined.  For contradiction, 
assume that its center of gravity could be more than a half a book length past the edge of 
the table. We know that the center of gravity of the whole system must be before the edge 
of the table, so we know that at  least as much weight must be strictly half a book  length 
behind the edge of the table (since the total weight available is only equal to the weight of 
the ﬁrst book). However, that would require that all the other books are fully on the table 
� 
without overhang, and the top book can’t possibly be on top of another book.

(c)  What  if  the  books  were  Harmonically  weighted:  1,

book had  to  be  on  top.  Would  it  be possible  for  the  top  of  the  stack  to  be  arbitrarily  far 
past the edge of the table? 

Solution.  Yes. 
We know  that  if all books weighed  the same  that  it would be possible  to stack  inﬁnitely 
far past  the end of  the  table.  We also know  that we can  stack books on  top of eachother 
until they way an arbitrary amount because the Harmonic Series diverges. Therefore, we 
can stack enough books together such that each stack weighs at least twice as much as the 
previous stack. Treating each stack like a book, part a of this problem illustrates how you 
� 
can stack arbitrarily far out from the edge of the table.

Problem 8.  (a)  Given that f (x) =  O(g(x)), prove that f (x)2  =  O(g(x)2 ) 

Solution.  Since f (x) =  O(g(x)), 
∃x0 , c ∀x ≥ x0 , f (x)

So, ∀x  ≥  x0  [f (x)2  ≤  c2g(x)2 ].  Therefore,  there exist x0

(b)  Let  f (x)  ::=  2x  and  g(x)  ::=  x,  so  f (x) =  O(g(x)).  Prove  that  2g(x)   =  o(2f (x) ),  so 
2f (x)  =  O(2g(x) ). 
Solution.  Now 2f (x)  = 22x  = 4x , and 2g(x)   = 2x .  So 2g(x)/2f (x)   = 2x/4x  = 2−x , so the ratio 
goes  to  zero  as  x  goes  to  inﬁnity,  proving  that  2g(x)   =  o(2f (x) ).  But  h1  =  o(h2 )  implies 
h2  =� O(h1 ) for any functions h1 , h2 , so 2f (x)   =  O(2g(x) ).
