Problem Set 7 
Due: November 9 

Reading: Counting, Notes I. & II.§1–3. 

Problem 1.  There are 20 books arranged in a row on a shelf. 

(a)  Describe a bijection between ways of choosing 6 of these books so that no two adja­
cent books are selected and 15­bit sequences with exactly 6 ones. 

(b)  How  many  ways  are  there  to  select  6  books  so  that  no  two  adjacent  books  are  se­
lected? 

Problem  2.  Answer  the  following  questions  and  provide  brief  justiﬁcations.  Not  every 
problem  can be  solved with  a  cute  formula;  you may have  to  fall back on  case  analysis, 
explicit enumeration, or ad hoc methods. 
You may leave factorials and binomial coefﬁcients in your answers. 

(a)  In how many different ways  can  the  letters  in  the name of  the popular  1980’s band 
BAN AN ARAM A  be arranged? 

(b)  How many  different  paths  are  there  from  point  (0, 0, 0)  to  point  (12, 24, 36)   if  every 
step increments one coordinate and leaves the other two unchanged? 

(c)  In how many different ways can 2n  students be paired up? 

(d)  How many  different  solutions  over  the  natural  numbers  are  there  to  the  following 
equation? 

x1  +  x2  +  x3  +  .  .  .  +  x8  =  100 
A solution is a speciﬁcation of the value of each variable xi . Two solutions are different if 
different values are speciﬁed for some variable xi .

(e)  In how many different ways  can one  choose n out of  2n objects,  given  that n of  the 
2n objects are identical and the other n are all unique? 

(f)  How  many  undirected  graphs  are  there  with  vertices  v1 , v2 , . . . , vn  if  self­loops  are 
permitted? 

(g)  There  are  15  sidewalk  squares  in  a  row.  Suppose  that  a  ball  can  be  thrown  so  that 
it bounces on 0,  1,  2, or 3 distinct sidewalk squares.  Assume  that  the ball always moves 
from left to right. How many different throws are possible? As an example, a two­bounce 
throw is illustrated below.

(h)  The working days in the next year can be numbered 1, 2, 3, . . . , 300.  I’d like to avoid 
as many as possible. 

•  On even­numbered days, I’ll say I’m sick. 
•  On days that are a multiple of 3, I’ll say I was stuck in trafﬁc. 
•  On days that are a multiple of 5, I’ll refuse to come out from under the blankets. 

In total, how many work days will I avoid in the coming year? 

Problem 3.  Use the pigeonhole principle to solve the following problems. 
(a)  Prove that among any n2 + 1  points within an n× n square there must exist two points 
√
whose distance is at most 
2. 

(b)  Jellybeans  of  6  different  ﬂavors  are  stored  in  5  jars.  There  are  11  jellybeans  of  each 
ﬂavor. Prove that some jar contains at least three jellybeans of one ﬂavor and also at least 
three jellybeans of some other ﬂavor. 

(c)  Prove that among every set of 30 integers, there exist two whose difference or sum is 
a multiple of 51. 

Problem 4.  Suppose you have seven dice— each a different color of  the rainbow; other­
wise the dice are standard, with six faces numbered 1 to 6. A roll is a sequence specifying 
a value for each die in rainbow (ROYGBIV) order. For example, one roll is (3, 1, 6, 1, 4, 5, 2)  
indicating  that  the red die showed a 3,  the orange die showed 1,  the yellow 6,  the green 
1, the blue 4, the indigo 5, and the violet 2. 

Problem Set 7

For the problems below, describe a bijection between the speciﬁed set of rolls and another 
set that is easily counted using the Product, Generalized Product, and similar rules. Then 
write  a  simple  numerical  expression  for  the  size  of  the  set  of  rolls.  You  do  not  need  to 
prove  that  the  correspondence  between  sets  you  describe  is  a  bijection,  and  you  do  not 
need to simplify the expression you come up with. 
For  example,  let  A be  the  set  of  rolls where  4  dice  come  up  showing  the  same  number, 
and the other 3 dice also come up the same, but with a different number.  Let R to be the 
set of seven rainbow colors and S be the set {1, . . . , 6} of dice values. 
Deﬁne B ::=  S2  × {3, 4} × R3 , where S2  is  the set of size 2 subsets of S , and R3  is  the set 
of size 3 subsets of R.  Then deﬁne a bijection  from A to B by mapping a roll  in A to  the 
sequence in B whose ﬁrst element is the set of two numbers that came up, whose second 
element  is  the number of  times  the  smaller of  the  two numbers came up  in  the  roll,  and 
whose third element is the set of colors of the three matching dice. 
For example, the roll 

(4, 4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4)  ∈ A 

maps to the triple 

({2, 4} , 3, {yellow,green,indigo}) ∈ B .

(a)  For how many rolls is the value on every die different? 

(b)  For how many rolls do two dice have the value 6 and the remaining ﬁve dice all have 
different values? 
Example:  (6, 2, 6, 1, 3, 4, 5)  is  a  roll  of  this  type,  but  (1, 1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 5)  and  (6, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 4)  
are not. 

(c)  For how many rolls do two dice have the same value and the remaining ﬁve dice all 
have different values? 
Example:  (4, 2, 4, 1, 3, 6, 5)  is  a  roll  of  this  type,  but  (1, 1, 2, 6, 1, 4, 5)  and  (6, 6, 1, 2, 4, 3, 4)  
are not. 

(d)  For  how many  rolls  do  two  dice  have  one  value,  two  different  dice  have  a  second 
value, and the remaining three dice a third value? 
Example:  (6, 1, 2, 1, 2, 6, 6)  is  a  roll  of  this  type,  but  (4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 5)  and  (5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 1, 2)  
are not.

Problem 5.  A derangement is a permutation (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) of the set {1, 2, . . . , n} such that 
xi  =�
i for all i.  For example, (2, 3, 4, 5, 1)  is a derangement, but (2, 1, 3, 5, 4)  is not because 
3 appears in the third position. The objective of this problem is to count derangements. 
It turns out to be easier to start by counting the permutations that are not derangements. 
Let  Si  be  the  set  of  all  permutations  (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn )  that  are  not  derangements  because 
n
 
xi  =  i.  So the set of non­derangements is 
Si . 
i=1 

(a)  What is |Si ?|
|
(b)  What is  Si  ∩ Sj where i =  j ? 
|
(c)  What is |Si1  ∩ Si2  ∩ · · · ∩ Sik | where i1 , i2 , . . . , ik  are all distinct? 
(d)  Use the inclusion­exclusion formula to express the number of non­derangements  in 
terms of sizes of possible intersections of the sets S1 , . . . , Sn . 
(e)  How many terms in the expression in part (d) have the form |Si1  ∩ Si2  ∩ · · · ∩ Sik |? 
�

(f)  Combine your answers to the preceding parts to prove the number of non­derangements 
is:

all permutations. What is that constant? Hint:
