Problem Set 5 
Due: October 21 

Reading: Course notes on number theory. 

Problem  1.  Suppose  that  one  domino  can  cover  exactly  two  squares  on  a  chessboard, 
either vertically or horizontally. 

(a)  Can you tile an 8  × 8  chessboard with 32 dominos? 

(b)  Can you tile an 8  × 8  chessboard with 31 dominos if opposite corners are removed?


(c)  Now  suppose  that  an  assortment  of  squares  are  removed  from  a  chessboard.  An 
example is shown below.

2 

Given a truncated chessboard, show how to construct a bipartite graph G  that has a per­
fect matching if and only if the chessboard can be tiled with dominos. 

(d)  Based  on  this  construction  and Hall’s  theorem,  can you  state  a necessary  and  sufﬁ­
cient condition for a truncated chessboard to be tilable with dominos? Try not to mention 
graphs or matchings! 

Problem 2.  Prove that gcd(ka,  kb) =  k  · gcd(a,  b) for all k >  0. 

Problem  3.  Suppose  that  a  ≡  b  (mod  n)   and  n  >  0.  Prove  or  disprove  the  following 
assertions: 
(a)  a ≡ bc  (mod  n) where c  ≥ 0 
c
(b)  ca  ≡ cb  (mod  n) where a,  b,  ≥ 0 

Problem 4.  An inverse of k  modulo n  >  1  is an integer, k−1 , such that 
k k−1  ≡ 1 
·
(mod   n).
Show that k  has an inverse iff gcd(k , n)  = 1.  Hint:  We saw how to prove the above when n  is 
prime. 

Problem 5.  Here is a long run of composite numbers: 

114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126 

Prove  that  there  exist  arbitrarily  long  runs  of  composite  numbers.  Consider  numbers  a 
little bigger than n!  where n! =  n  · (n   − 1)

Problem 6.  Take a big number,  such as 37273761261.  Sum  the digits, where every other 
one is negated: 

3 + (−7) + 2 + (−7) + 3 + (−7) + 6 + (−1) + 2 + (−6) + 1  =  −11 

As it turns out, the original number is a multiple of 11 if and only if this sum is a multiple 
of 11. 

(a)  Use a result from elsewhere on this problem set to show that 10 ≡ −1k  (mod 11). 
k
(b)  Using this fact, explain why the procedure above works. 

Problem 7.  Let Sk  =  1k  + 2 + . . . + (p − 1)k , where p is an odd prime and k is a positive 
k
multiple of p − 1. Use Fermat’s theorem to prove that Sk  ≡ −1  (mod p).
