Problem Set 6 
Due: October 26 

Reading: Notes 7 on State Machines & Notes 8 on Series and Asymptotics. 

Problem  1.  You’ve  seen  how  the  RSA  encryption  scheme  works,  but  why  is  it  hard  to 
break?  In  this  problem,  you  will  see  that  ﬁnding  secret  keys  is  as  hard  as  ﬁnding  the 
prime factorizations of integers.  Since there is a general consensus in the crypto commu­
nity  (enough  to  persuade  many  large  ﬁnancial  institutions,  for  example)  that  factoring 
numbers with  a  few hundred digits  requires  astronomical  computing  resources, we  can 
therefore be sure it will take the same kind of overwhelming effort to ﬁnd RSA secret keys 
of  a  few  hundred  digits.  This means we  can  be  conﬁdent  the  private  RSA  keys  are  not 
somehow revealed by the public keys 1 
For  this  problem,  assume  that  n  =  p · q where  p, q are  both  odd  primes  and  that  e  is  the 
public  key  and  d the  secret  key  of  the  RSA  protocol  as  described  in Week  6 Notes.  Let 
x ::=   e · d − 1. 

(a)  Show that φ(n) divides x. 

(b)  Conclude that 4 divides x. 
(c)  Show that if gcd(r, n)  = 1, then r ≡ 1  (mod   n). 
x
A  square  root  of m  modulo  n  is  a  nonnegative  integer  s  < n  such  that  s ≡  m  (mod  n). 
2
Here  is a nice  fact  to know:  when n is a product of  two odd primes,  then every number 
m such that gcd(m, n)  = 1   has 4 square roots modulo n. 
In particular, the number 1 has four square roots modulo n. The two trivial ones are 1 and 
n − 1  (which is ≡ −1  (mod  n)). The other two are called the nontrivial square roots of 1. 

(d)	 Since you know x, then for any integer, r , you can also compute the remainder, y , of 
2  ≡ rx
rx/2  divided by n.  So y
(mod  n).  Now  if r  is relatively prime to n,  then y will be a 
square root of 1 modulo n by part (c).

1This is a very weak kind of “security” property, because it doesn’t even rule out the possibility of deci­
phering RSA encoded messages by some method that did not require knowing the secret key. Nevertheless, 
oveer twenty years experience supports the security of RSA in practice. 

Problem Set 6 

2 

Show that if y turns out to be a nontrivial root of 1 modulo n, then you can factor n.  Hint: 
From the fact that y − 1  = (y +  1)(y − 1), show that y +  1  must be divisible by exactly one 
2
of q and p. 

(e)  It  turns  out  that  at  least half  the positive  integers  r  < n  that  are  relatively prime  to 
n will yield y ’s in part (d) that are nontrivial roots of 1.  Conclude that if, in addition to n 
and the public key, e, you also knew  the secret key d,  then you can be sure of being able 
to factor n. 

Problem 2.  The Massachusetts Turnpike Authority is concerned about the integrity of the 
new Zakim bridge.  Their consulting architect has warned that the bridge may collapse if 
more  than  1000  cars  are on  it  at  the  same  time.  The Authority has  also been warned by 
their  trafﬁc  consultants  that  the  rate  of  accidents  from  cars  speeding  across  bridges  has 
been increasing. 
Both  to  lighten  trafﬁc  and  to  discourage  speeding,  the  Authority  has  decided  to  make 
the  bridge  one­way  and  to  put  tolls  at  both  ends  of  the  bridge  (don’t  laugh,  this  is Mas­
sachusetts).  So  cars will  pay  tolls  both  on  entering  and  exiting  the  bridge,  but  the  tolls 
will be different.  In particular, a car will pay $3  to enter onto  the bridge and will pay $2 
to  exit.  To  be  sure  that  there  are  never  too many  cars  on  the  bridge,  the Authority will 
let a car onto the bridge only if the difference between the amount of money currently at 
the  entry  toll booth minus  the amount at  the  exit  toll booth  is  strictly  less  than a  certain 
threshold amount of $T0 . 
The  consultants  have  decided  to model  this  scenario with  a  state machine whose  states 
are triples of natural numbers, (A, B , C ), where 

•  A is an amount of money at the entry booth, 

•  B is an amount of money at the exit booth, and 

•  C is a number of cars on the bridge. 

Any  state with C >  1000   is  called  a  collapsed  state, which  the Authority dearly hopes  to 
avoid. There will be no transition out of a collapsed state. 
Since the toll booth collectors may need to start off with some amount of money in order 
to  make  change,  and  there  may  also  be  some  number  of  “ofﬁcial”  cars  already  on  the 
bridge  when  it  is  opened  to  the  public,  the  consultants  must  be  ready  to  analyze  the 
system  started at  any  state.  So  let A0  be  the  initial number of dollars at  the entrance  toll 
booth, B0  the initial number of dollars at the exit toll booth, and C0  the number of ofﬁcial 
cars  on  the  bridge when  it  is  opened.  The Authority will  be  careful  to  ensure  that C0  is 
not large enough to cause a collapse.  You should assume that even ofﬁcial cars pay tolls 
on exiting or entering the bridge after the bridge is opened. 

Problem Set 6 

3 

(a)  Give a mathematical model of the Authority’s system for  letting cars on and off  the 
bridge by specifying a transition relation between states of the form (A, B , C ) above. 

(b)  Characterize each of the following derived variables 
A, B , A +  B , A − B , 3C  − A, 2A − 3B , B  +  3C, 2A − 3B  − 6C, 2A − 2B  − 3C 

as one of the following 

C 
constant 
SI 
strictly increasing 
strictly decreasing 
SD 
weakly increasing but not constant  WI 
weakly decreasing but not constant  WD 
N 
none of the above 

and brieﬂy explain your reasoning. 

The Authority has asked their engineering consultants to determine T  and to verify that 
this policy will keep the number of cars from exceeding 1000. 
The consultants reason that if A0  is the initial number of dollars at the entrance toll booth, 
B0  is  the  initial number  of dollars  at  the  exit  toll  booth,  and C0  is  the number  of  ofﬁcial 
cars on the bridge when it is opened, then an additional 1000  − C0  cars can be allowed on 
the  bridge,  so  as  long  as A  − B  has  not  increased  by  3(1000  − C0 )  there  shouldn’t more 
than 1000 cars on the bridge.  So they recommend deﬁning 
T0  ::=  3(1000  − C0 ) +  (A0  − B0 ).  

(c)  Use  the results of part  (b)  to deﬁne a simple predicate, P , on states of  the  transition 
system which  is satisﬁed by  the start state,  that  is P (A0 , B0 , C0 )  holds,  is not satisﬁed by 
any  collapsed  state,  and  is  an  invariant  of  the  system.  Verify  that  the  P  you  deﬁne  has 
these properties. 

(d)  A  clever MIT  intern working  for  the Turnpike Authority  agrees  that  the Turnpike’s 
bridge management  policy will  be  safe:  the  bridge will  not  collapse.  But  she warns  her 
boss  that  the  policy  will  lead  to  deadlock—  a  situation  where  trafﬁc  can’t  move  on  the 
bridge even though the bridge has not collapsed. 
Explain more precisely in terms of system transitions what the intern means, and brieﬂy, 
but clearly, justify her claim.

Problem  3.  Vertices  u,  v  in  a  digraph  are  said  to  be  unconnected  when  there  is  no  path 
either from u  to v  or from v  to u. The following procedure can be applied to any digraph, 
G:

Pick two vertices u,   v  such that either


1.  there is an edge (u,   v) of G  and there is also a path from u  to v  which does not include 
this edge; in this case, delete the edge (u,  v), or 

2.  u  and v  are unconnected; in this case, add the edge (u,  v). 

Repeat  these  operations  until  it  is  no  longer  possible  to  ﬁnd  vertices  u,  v  to  which  an 
operation applies. 
This  procedure  can  be modelled  as  a  state machine.  The  start  state  is  G,  and  the  states 
are all possible digraphs with the same vertices as G.  The ﬁnal states are the digraphs on 
which no operation is possible. 

(a)  For any state, G, let e  be its number of edges, and p its number of pairs of unconnected 
vertices. Deﬁne a decreasing natural number valued derived variable that is a function of 
e  and p. Conclude that the procedure terminates started on any ﬁnite digraph, G. 

(b)  Prove that the set of ﬁnal states reachable from DAG start states are the line graphs. 

(c)  Prove that the property of being a DAG is an invariant of this procedure. 

(d)  Prove  that  if  G  is  a  DAG,  the  procedure  terminates  with  a  line  graph  whose  path 
relation is a topological sort of the partial order deﬁned by G.  Hint:  Strengthen the DAG 
invariant in the previous part. 

Problem 4.  (a)  Give an example of a stable match between 3 boys and 3 girls where no 
person gets their ﬁrst choice. 

(b)  Describe a simple procedure to determine whether or not a stable marriage problem 
has a unique solution, that is, only one possible stable marriage assignment. 

Problem  5.  A Harvard  BS  graduates  and  starts with  an  annual  salary  of  $140,000, with 
a $25,000  raise guaranteed  every year.  An MIT SB graduate  starts with $100,000, with a 
guaranteed 15% raise every year. Assume the bankrate is a ﬁxed 3%  per year. That is, the 
bank will pay $1.03 a year from now if you deposit $1.00 today. 

Problem Set 6

(a)  Suppose  both  graduates  retire  after  the  same  number  of  years.  Use  the  fact  that 
x  =  o((1  +  �)x ) to explain why the MIT SB must come out ahead if they work for enough 
years.  (You should not make use of closed forms for various sums in your explanation.) 

(b)  Suppose both graduates retire after n  years.  For which values of n  is the MIT gradu­
ate’s salary package better that the Harvard grad’s? 

Problem  6.  Books  Books  and  more  Books!  If  the  6.042  staff  is  to  stand  a  chance  at  the

Book Extension Stacking Challenge, we have to consider all the angles!

Recall the basic book stacking challenge from the course notes where you have an unlim­

ited supply of books to stack that are all the same weight. 


(a)  What if instead of all books weighing the same, you have a book that weighs 1 pound, 
a book that weighs  1
4  pounds, where each successive book 
2  pounds, a book that weighs  1 
weighs half as much as  the previous book.  Say you had n  such books,  and also  that  the 
you have a duplicate of the lightest book. How far out can you stack the books? Note that 
all books  are  still  the  same  size,  just different weights.  Hint:  Where  should  the heaviest 
books be? 

(b)  What if you had to stack such that the lightest books were on the bottom of the stack 
and  the  heaviest  books were  on  top  of  the  stack.  How  far  out  can  you  stack  an  inﬁnite 
number of books where each book  is  twice as heavy as  the book below  it (we’re  looking 
for either inﬁnitely far or ﬁnitely far)?  Justify your answer. 
(c)  What  if  the  books  were  Harmonically  weighted:  1,  2 ,  3 ,  etc.,  etc.,  and  the  heaviest 
1
1
book had  to  be  on  top.  Would  it  be possible  for  the  top  of  the  stack  to  be  arbitrarily  far 
past the edge of the table? 

Problem  7.  Use  the  integral method  to  ﬁnd  upper  and  lower  bounds  for  the  following 
summation that differ by at most 0.05.  �  1
∞
i3 
i=1 
Hint: Try adding the ﬁrst few terms explicitly and then use integrals to bound the sum of 
the remaining terms. 

Problem 8.  (a)  Given that f (x) =  O(g(x)), prove that f (x)2  =  O(g(x)2 ) 

(b)  Let  f (x)  ::=  2x  and  g(x)  ::=  x,  so  f (x) =  O(g(x)).  Prove  that  2g(x)   =  o(2f (x) ),  so 
2f (x)  =  O(2g(x) ).
