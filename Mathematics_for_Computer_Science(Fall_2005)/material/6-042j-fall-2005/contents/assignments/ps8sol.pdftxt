Problem  2.  Suppose  a  generalized World  Series  between  the  Sox  and  the  Cardinals  in­
volved 2n  +  1  games.  As usual,  the generalized Series will stop as soon as one team has 
won more than half the possible games. 

(a)  Suppose that when the Sox ﬁnally win the GSeries, the Cards have managed to win 
exactly r  games (so r  ≤ n).  How many possible win­loss patterns are possible for the Sox 
to win the GSeries in this way? Express your answer as a binomial coefﬁcient.

(1) 

Stars and bars, or better “S”’s and “C”’s: we can represent a win­loss pattern as a sequence 
of  r  C’s  and  n  + 1 S’s,  where  an  S  in  the  ith  position  indicates  that  the  Sox won  the  ith 
game.  However,  the  sequence must  end with  an S ,  so  the number  of  such  sequences  is 
� 
the same as the number of sequences of r  C’s and n  S’s, namely (1). 

(b)  How  many  possible  win­loss  patterns  are  possible  for  the  Sox  to  win  the  GSeries 
when the Cards win at most r  games? Express your answer as a binomial coefﬁcient.

Solution. 

(2) 

We can represent a win­loss pattern as a sequence of r  C’s and n  + 1 S’s, as in part (a). The 
number of C’s which occur before  the n  + 1st  (last) S  is  the number of games  the Cards

won when the GSeries ends.

(3)

Solution.  The  righthand  side  of  (3)  is  the  number  of  patterns  where  the  Cards  win  at 
most r  games.  But they can at most r  by winning exactly i  games, where 0 ≤ i  ≤ r .  So by 
part  (a),  the number  of win­loss patterns  is  given  by  the  expression  of  the  lefthand  side 
� 
of (3). 

(d)  Verify equation (3) by induction using algebra. 
Solution.  By induction on r , taking (3) as P (r).

Problem 3.  (a)  1  Let an  be the number of length n ternary strings (strings of the digits 0, 
1, and 2) that contain two consecutive digits that are the same.  For example, a2  =  3 since 
the only ternary strings of length 2 with matching consecutive digits are 11, 22, and 33. 
Also, a0  =  a1  =  0, since in order to have consecutive matching digits, a string must be of 
length at least two. 
Find a recurrence formula for an . 

Solution.  Call a ternary string with at least two consecutive matching digits a good string. 
Let an  be the number of good strings of length n.  Call the other 3n  − an  strings of length 
n the bad strings. 
Now  for  n  ≥  2,  a  good  string  of  length  n  consists  of  (1)  a  good  string  of  length  n  − 1 
followed  by  any  digit,  or  else  (2)  a  bad  string  of  length  n  −  1 followed  by  a  digit  that 
matches the last symbol of the bad string.  (Note that there is such a last symbol because 
n − 1 ≥ 1.) There are 3an−1  strings of type (1) and 3n−1  − an−1  strings of type (2), and these 
two types of strings are disjoint.  So 
an  =  3an−1  + 3n−1  − an−1  =  2an−1  + 3n−1  . 
Also, a good string must have at least two digits, so a0  =  a1  =  0.

Solution.  For n  ≥  1,  the coefﬁcient of xn  in  the series expansion of 2xA(x)  is 2an−1 ,  and 
the coefﬁcient of xn  in

is obviously 3n−1 .  So in the series for A(x) − 2xA(x) − x/(1  − 3x), all the coefﬁcients of x
for n   ≥ 2  are zero. This leaves 
A(x) − 2xA(x) −

(c)	 Find real numbers r   and s  such that

(1  − 2x)(1  − 3x)
Solution.  Expressing the righthand side of this equation as 
r(1  − 3x) +  s(1  − 2x) 
(1  − 2x)(1  − 3x) 
we need r,  s  so the numerators of the left and righthand expressions are equal, namely, so 
that 
1 =  r(1  − 3x) +  s(1  − 2x).  
So  letting  x  = 1/2,  we  conclude  that  1 =  r(−1/2)   so  r  =  −2,  and  letting  x  = 1/3,  we 
� 
conclude that 1 =  s(1/3), so s  = 3.

So for n  ≥ 2, the coefﬁcient of xn  in the generating function is 3 · (−2)  times the coefﬁcient 
of xn−2  in 1/(1   − 2x), plus 3 3   times the coefﬁcient of xn−2  in 1/(1  − 3x). Namely,

an  = (−3  · 2)2n−2  +  323n−2  =  3(3n−1  − 2n−1 ).

Problem  4.  Suppose  there  are  four  kinds  of  doughnuts:  plain,  chocolate,  glazed,  and 
butterscotch. Write generating functions for the number of ways to select the ﬂavors of n 
doughnuts, subject to the following different constraints. 

(a)  Each ﬂavor occurs an odd number of times. 
Solution.  Generating function for picking chocolate doughnuts is x/(1  − x2 ), so for all 4

doughnuts it is

(b)  Each ﬂavor occurs a multiple of 3 times.

for all 4 kinds. 

(c)  There are no chocolate doughnuts and at most one glazed doughnut. 
Solution.  GF for chocolate is 1, for glazed 1  +  x, for others 1/(1  − x), so for all 4 it is 
1  +  x 
(1  − x)2 

�

(d)  There are 1, 3, or 11 chocolate doughnuts, and 2, 4, or 5 glazed. 
Solution.  GF  for chocolate  is x  +  x3  +  x11 ,  for glazed x2  +  x4  +  x5 , and 1/(1  − x)   for  the 
others, so 

(x  +  x3  +  x11 )(x2  +  x4  +  x5 ) 
(1  − x)2 

for all. 

(e)  Each ﬂavor occurs at least 10 times. 
Solution.  GF for chocolate is x10/(1  − x), so 
40x
(1  − x)4 

for all 4.
