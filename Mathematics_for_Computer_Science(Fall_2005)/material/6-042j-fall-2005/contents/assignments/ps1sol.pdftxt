Problem 1.  A real number r  is called sensible  if  there exist positive  integers a  and b  such 
√
that  a/b  =  r .  For example, setting a  = 2  and b  = 1  shows that 
2  is sensible. Prove that 
2  is not sensible.  (Consider only positive real roots in this problem)

Solution.  The proof is by contradiction. Assume for the purpose of contradiction that

is sensible. Then there exist positive integers a  and b  such that  a/b  = 
2. Squaring both

sides of this equation gives a/b  =

4, which implies that

√
Since 
4  is rational, we can write it as a fraction x/y  in lowest­terms, where x  is an integer 
3
and y  is a positive integer. Therefore, we have: 

√

4  =  x/y 
4  =  x 3/y 3 
4y  3  =  x 3 

In  the  last  equation,  the  left  side  is  even,  and  so  the  right  side must be  even.  Since x3  is 
even, x  itself must be even.  This implies that the right side is actually divisible by 8, and 
so  the  left  side must also be divisible by 8.  Therefore,  y 3  is even,  and  so y  itself must be 
even. 
√
The  fact  that  both  x  and  y  are  even  contradicts  the  fact  that  x/y  is  a  fraction  in  lowest 
� 
terms. Therefore, 
2  is not sensible.

Problem 2.  Translate the following sentence into a predicate formula: 

There  is  a  student  who  has  e­mailed  exactly  two  other  people  in  the  class, 
besides possibly herself.

The domain of discourse  should be  the  set of  students  in  the  class;  in addition,  the only 
predicates that you may use are equality and E (x,  y), meaning that “x  has sent e­mail to 
y .” 

Solution.  A good way to begin tackling this problem is by trying to translate parts of the 
sentance. Begin by trying to assert that student x  has emailed students y  and z : 
E (x,  y) ∧ E (x,  z ).  

Now we want to say that y  and z  not the same student, and neither of them is x  either: 
x  =  y ∧ x  =  z  ∧ y  =  z , 
� 
� 
� 
� 
where x   =�  y  abbreviates = (x  =  y). 
Now, we must think of a way to say that the only people x  might have e­mailed are x, y 
and z : 
∀ s,  E (x,   s) −→ s  =  x  ∨ s  =  y ∨ s  =  z . 

Finally, we can say there is some student who emailed exactly two other two students by 
existentially quantifying x,   y  and z .  So the complete translation is 
∃ x∃ y∃ z .   E (x,  y) ∧ E (x,  z )∧

x  =  y ∧ x  =  z  ∧ y  =  z∧ 
∀ s,  E (x,   s) −→ s  =  x  ∨ s  =  y ∨ s  =  z .

Problem  3.  Express  each  of  the  following  predicates  and  propositions  in  formal  logic 
notation. The domain of discourse is the nonnegative integers, N. 
In addition to the propositional operators, variables and quantiﬁers, you may deﬁne pred­
icates using addition, multiplication, and equality symbols, but no constants (like 0, 1, . . . ). 
For example, the proposition “n is an even number ” could be written 
∃ m.  (m   +  m  =  n). 

(a)  n  is the sum of three perfect squares. 

Solution. 

∃ x∃ y∃ z .  (x x  +  y · y +  z z  =  n)

Since  the  constant  0  is  not  allowed  to  appear  explicitly,  the  predicate  “x  = 0”  can’t  be 
written directly, but note that it could be expressed in a simple way as: 

x +  x =  x. 

Then the predicate x > y could be expressed 
∃ w
. (y +  w =  x) ∧ (w = 0).
� 
Note  that we’ve used “w =�  0”  in  this  formula,  even  though  it’s  technically not allowed. 
But  since  “w  =� 
0”  is  equivalent  to  the  allowed  formula  “ ¬ (w +  w  =  w),”  we  can  use 
“w =�  0” with  the understanding  that  it  abbreviates  the  real  thing.  And now  that we’ve 
shown how to express “x > y”, it’s ok to use it too. 

(b)  x > 1. 
Solution.  The straightforward approach is to deﬁne x = 1  as ∀ y . xy =  y and then express 
x > 1  as ∃ y . (y = 1)  ∧ (x > y).

(c)  n is a prime number.

(d)  n is a product of two distinct primes. 

Solution. 

∃ x∃ y . ¬ (x =

(e)  There is no largest prime number. 

Solution.  Of  course  this  is  a  true  statement,  so  it  could  be  expressed  by  the  logically 
equivalent  formula  “1   = 1,”  but  even  if  we  didn’t  know  this,  we  could  transcribe  the 
statement directly as: 
¬ (∃ p. I S ­ PR IME(p) ∧ (∀ q . I S ­ PR IM E(q)  −→ p ≥ q))

(f)  (Goldbach  Conjecture)  Every  even  natural  number  n  >  2  can  be  expressed  as  the 
sum of two primes. 
Solution.  We  can  deﬁne  n  >  2  with  the  formula  ∃ y .  (y =  1)  ∧ (x   >  y +  y).  Likewise, 
n = 2k can be expressed as n =  k +  k . Then we can express the Conjecture with: 
∀ n.  ((n > 2  ∧ ∃ k
2k) −→ ∃ p∃ q

Problem 4.  If a set, A, is ﬁnite, then | A < 2|A|  = 
|P (A)|

, and so there is no surjection from 
set A to its powerset.  Show that this is still true if A is inﬁnite.  Hint:  Remember Russell’s 
paradox and consider { x ∈ A x /∈ f (x)} where f is such a surjection. 
| 
Solution. We prove there is no surjection by contradiction: suppose there was a surjection 
f :  A → P (A) for some set A. Let W ::=  { x ∈ A x /∈ f (x)} .  So by deﬁnition, 
| 
(x ∈ W ) ←→ (x /
∈ f (x))  
(4)
for  all  x  ∈  A.  But  W  ⊆  A by  deﬁnition  and  hence  is  a  member  of  P (A).  This  means 
W =  f (a) for some a ∈ A, since f is a surjection to P (A).  So we have from (4), that 
(x ∈ f (a))   ←→ (x /
∈ f (x))  
(5)
for all x ∈  A.  Substituting a for x in (5) yields a contradiction, proving that there cannot 
� 
be such an f . 

Problem 5.  (a)  Prove that 
∃ z . [P (z ) ∧ Q(z )]   −→  [∃ x. P (x
) ∧ ∃ y . Q(y)]  
is valid.  (Use the proof in the subsection on Validity in Week 2 Notes as a guide to writing 
your own proof here.)

Solution.  Proof.  Assume 

z . [P (z ) ∧ Q(z )]. 
∃
(7)
That is, P (z ) ∧ Q(z ) holds for some element, z , of the domain.  Let c be this element; that 
is, we have P (c) ∧ Q(c). 
In particular, P (c) holds by itself.  So we conclude (by Existential Generalization)∃x P (x). 
We conclude ∃y Q(y) similarly. Hence, 
∃x. P (x

) ∧ ∃y . Q(y) 

(8)

holds. 
This  shows  that  (8)  holds  in  any  interpretation  in  which  (7)  holds.  Therefore,  (7)  im­
plies (8) in all interpretations, that is, (6) is valid. 

� 

(b)  Prove that the converse of (6) is not valid by describing a counter model as in Week 
2 Notes. 
Solution.  Proof.  We describe a counter model in which, (8) is true and (7) is false. Namely, 
let the domain, D , be {π , e}, P (x) mean “x =  π ,” and Q(y) mean “y =  e.”  Then, ∃x. P (x)  
is true (let x be π ) and likewise ∃y . Q(y) is true (let y be e), so (8) holds. 
On the other hand, Q(π) is not true, so P (π) ∧ Q(π) is not true. Likewise P (e) ∧ Q(e) is not 
true.  Since these are the only elements of D , it is not true that there is an element, z , of D , 
such that P (z ) ∧ Q(z ), That is, (7) is not true.

Problem 6.  (a)  Give an example where the following result fails: 
False Theorem.  For sets A, B , C , and D , let 
L ::=  (A ∪ C ) × (B ∪ D),  
R ::=  (A × B ) ∪ (C × D).  

Then L =  R. 
Solution.  If A =  D =  ∅ and B and C are both nonempty, then L =  C × B =  ∅, but R =

Bogus proof.  Since L and R are both sets of pairs, it’s sufﬁcient to prove that (x, y) ∈ L
(x, y)  ∈ R for all x, y . 
The proof will be a chain of iff implications: 
(x, y)  ∈ L 
x ∈ A ∪ C and y ∈ B ∪ D , 
either x ∈ A or x ∈ C , and either y ∈ B or y ∈ D , 
(x ∈ A and y ∈ B ) or else (x ∈ C and y ∈ D), 
(x, y)  ∈ A × B , or (x, y)  ∈ C × D , 
(x, y)  ∈ (A × B ) ∪ (C × D) =  R.

Solution.  The mistake is in the third “iff.”  If [x ∈ A or x ∈ C , and either y ∈ B or y ∈ D], 
it does not necessarily follow that (x, y)  ∈  (A × B ) ∪ (C × D).  It might be that (x, y) is in 
A × D instead.  This happens,  for example,  if A =  {1} , B  =  {2} , C  =  {3} , D  =  {4}, and

(x, y)  = (1, 4). 

(c)  Fix the proof to show that R ⊆ L. 
Solution.  Replacing  the  third “iff ” by “which will be  true when,”  yields a  correct proof 
that (x, y) ∈ L will be true when (x, y)  ∈ R, which implies that R ⊆ L.
