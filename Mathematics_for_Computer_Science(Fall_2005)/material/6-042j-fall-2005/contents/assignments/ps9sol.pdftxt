Solutions to Problem Set 9 

Problem 1.  Professor Plum, Mr.  Green, and Miss Scarlet are all plotting to shoot Colonel 
Mustard.  If one of  these  three has both  an  opportunity  and  the  revolver,  then  that person 
shoots Colonel Mustard.  Otherwise,  Colonel Mustard  escapes.  Exactly  one  of  the  three 
has an opportunity with the following probabilities: 

Pr {Plum has opportunity} = 1/6 
Pr {Green has opportunity} = 2/6 
Pr {Scarlet has opportunity} = 3/6 

Exactly  one  has  the  revolver  with  the  following  probabilities,  regardless  of  who  has  an 
opportuntity: 

Pr {Plum has revolver} = 4/8 
Pr {Green has revolver} = 3/8 
Pr {Scarlet has revolver} = 1/8 

(a)  Draw a tree diagram for this problem.  Indicate edge and outcome probabilities.

(b)  What is the probability that Colonel Mustard is shot? 

Solution.  Denote each outcome with a pair indicating who has the opportunity and who 
has  the  revolver.  In  this  notation,  the  event  that  Colonel Mustard  is  shot  consists  of  all 
outcomes where a single person has both: 
{(P, P ), (G,  G), (S, S )} 

The probability of this event is the sum of the outcome probabilities: 
Pr {{(P, P ), (G,   G), (S, S )}} =  Pr {(P, P )} +  Pr {(G, G)} +  Pr {(S, S )} 
= 4/48  +  6/48  +   3/48 
=  13/48

(c)  What is the probability that Colonel Mustard is shot, given that Miss Scarlet does not 
have the revolver? 

Solution.  Let  S  be  the  event  that  Colonel Mustard  is  shot,  and  let  N  be  the  event  that

Problem 2.  There are three prisoners in a maximum­security prison for ﬁctional villains: 
the Evil Wizard Voldemort, the Dark Lord Sauron, and Little Bunny Foo­Foo.  The parole 
board has declared that it will release two of the three, chosen uniformly at random, but 
has not yet released their names.  Naturally, Sauron ﬁgures that he will be released to his 
home in Mordor, where the shadows lie, with probability 2/3. 
A guard offers to tell Sauron the name of one of the other prisoners who will be released 
(either  Voldemort  or  Foo­Foo).  However,  Sauron  declines  this  offer.  He  reasons  that 
if  the  guard  says,  for  example,  “Little  Bunny  Foo­Foo  will  be  released”,  then  his  own 

4 

Solutions to Problem Set 9 

probability of release will drop to 1/2. This is because he will then know that either he or 
Voldemort will also be released, and these two events are equally likely. 

Using a  tree diagram and  the  four­step method,  either prove  that  the Dark Lord Sauron 
has  reasoned correctly or prove  that he  is wrong.  Assume  that  if  the guard has a choice 
of naming either Voldemort or Foo­Foo (because both are to be released), then he names 
one of the two uniformly at random. 

Solution.  Sauron has reasoned incorrectly.  In order to understand his error, let’s begin by 
working out the sample space, noting events of interest, and computing outcome proba­
bilities:

Deﬁne the events S , F , and “F ” as follows: 

“F ” =  Guard says Foo­Foo is released 
F  =  Foo­Foo is released 
S  =  Sauron is released 

The outcomes in each of these events are noted in the tree diagram. 

Sauron’s error is in failing to realize that the event F  (Foo­foo will be released) is different 
from the event “F ” (the guard says Foo­foo will be released).  In particular, the probability 
that Sauron is released, given that Foo­foo is released, is indeed 1/2: 
Pr {S  ∩ F }
Pr {F }

But the probability that Sauron is released given that the guard merely says so is still 2/3:

Pr {S

Pr { “F

So Sauron’s probability of release is actually unchanged by the guard’s statement.

Problem 3.  You shufﬂe a deck of cards and deal your friend a 5­card hand. 

(a)  Suppose your friend says, “I have the ace of spades.” What is the probablity that she 
has another ace?

Solution.  The sample space for this experient is the set of all 5­card hands. All outcomes

your friend has the ace of spades, and let A  be the event that your friend has another ace. 
Our objective is to compute: 

Pr {A S } = 
| 

Pr {A  ∩ S }
Pr {S } 
The number of hands containing the ace of spades is equal to the number of ways to select

4 of the remaining 51 cards. Therefore:

(c)  Are your answers to (a) and (b) the same? Explain why. 

Solution.  The  answers  are  different.  There  are  four  aces,  so  there  are  sixteen  different 
subsets of aces that your friend could have. 

•	 If your  friend  says,  “I have  the ace of  spades”,  then  eight of  these  subsets  are  ruled 
out:  those not containing the ace of spades.

•	 However,  if your friend says, “I have an ace”,  then only one subset is ruled out:  the 
subset containing no aces. 

Thus,  the  probability  that  your  friend  has  a  second  ace  is  different  in  these  two  cases, 
� 
because we are conditioning on two very different events! 

Problem  4.  Finalphobia  is  a  rare  disease  in which  the  victim  has  the  delusion  that  he  or 
she is being subjected to an intense mathematical examination. 

•	 A person selected uniformly at random has ﬁnalphobia with probability 1/100. 

•	 A person with ﬁnalphobia has shaky hands with probability 9/10. 

•	 A person without ﬁnalphobia has shaky hands with probability 1/20. 

What is the probablility that a person selected uniformly at random has ﬁnalphobia, given 
that he or she has shaky hands? 

Solution.  Let F  be  the event  that  the  randomly­selected person has ﬁnalphobia,  and  let 
S  be the event that he or she has shaky hands. A tree diagram is worked out below: 

has shakyhands?noyesyesnoyesno99/1001/1009/101/101/2019/20has finalphobia?FSXX9/10001801/200099/20001/1000ProbabilityXX8

So,  while  it’s  true  that  someone  with  shaky  hands  is  ﬁve  times  more  likely  to  have  ﬁ­
nalphobia  than  someone  with  steady  hands,  it  remains  a  poor  bet  –about  1  in  5  –that

Problem  5.  Outside  of  their  hum­drum  duties  as  6.042  TAs,  Sayan  is  trying  to  learn  to 
levitate  using  only  intense  concentration  and  Jelani  is  launching  a  “Nelson  2008”  presi­
dential campaign.  Suppose that Sayan’s probability of levitating is 1/6, Jelani’s chance of 
becoming president is 1/4, and the success of one does not alter the other ’s chances. 

(a)  If at least one of them succeeds, what is the probability that Sayan learns to levitate? 
Solution.  Let L  be the event that Sayan learns to levitate, and let P  be the event that Jelani 
becomes president. We can work out the desired probability as follows: 
Pr {L  ∩ (L  ∪ P )}

(L  ∪ P )} =

The ﬁrst step uses the deﬁnition of conditional probability.  In the second step, we rewrite 
both  the  top  and  bottom  of  the  fraction  using  set  identities.  Then  we  substitute  in  the 
� 
given probability and simplify.

Problem 6.  Suppose n balls are thrown randomly into n boxes, so each ball lands in each 
box with uniform probability.  Also,  suppose  the outcome of  each  throw  is  independent 
of all the other throws. 

(a)  Let  Xi  be  an  indicator  random  variable  whose  value  is  1  if  box  i  is  empty  and  0 
otherwise.  Write  a  simple  closed  form  expression  for  the  probability  distribution  of Xi . 
Are X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn  independent random variables? 
Solution.  Box i is empty iff all n balls land in other boxes. The probability that a ball will

land in another box in (n − 1)/n = 1 − (1/n), and since the balls are thrown independently, 
we have

on the probability of at least k  balls in the ﬁrst box applies just as well to any box, we can 
apply the Union Bound to having at least k  balls in at least one of the n  boxes:

Problem  7.  (An  open­ended  discussion  question.)  Consider  a  set,  S ,  consisting  of  77 
twenty­one digit numbers. We can use the pigeonhole principle to prove that two distinct 
subsets  of  the  numbers  in  S  have  the  same  sum,  but  actually  ﬁnding  two  such  sets  is 
can be difﬁcult.  Naively, we could sum  the elements  in all 277  subsets and ﬁnd  two  that 
match, but this is a huge computational task. 
√
Recall the birthday principle:  If there are d  days in a year and 
2d  people in a room, then 
the probability that two share a birthday is about 1  − 1/e  = 0.632 .  .  .. 

12 

Solutions to Problem Set 9 

How could  the birthday principle help you ﬁnd  two distinct subsets of S with  the same 
sum using signiﬁcantly fewer than 277  operations —say only a trillion operations?  What 
assumptions must you make? 

Solution.  Assume  that  the  sums  are  uniformly  distributed,  mutually  independent  ran­
· 
dom variables taking on values in the range [0, . . . , 77  1021 ]. Then we have a good chance 
of ﬁnding two subsets with the same sum if the number of subsets we consider is about: 
√
2  77  · 1021  ≈ 4  1011 
·
· 

Of course, the sums are not uniformly distributed; in fact, the sum of a random subset is 
likely to be close to the expected value.  This nonuniformity only improves the computa­
tional picture,  however.  (If  almost  everyone were  born  in  July,  then ﬁnding  two people 
with the same birthday would be easier.) 
The sums are also not mutually independent. However, if we sum a few hundred billion 
selected  at  random,  then  the  sets  are  likely  to  be  different  enough  that  their  sums  are 
“mostly kinda” independent. 
Overall,  it  seems  that  several  billion  sums  should  sufﬁce  to  ﬁnd  two  subsets  with  the 
� 
same sum.
