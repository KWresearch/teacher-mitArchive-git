Problem Set 10 
Due: December 9 

Reading: Lecture notes for weeks 13 and 14. 

Problem 1.  MIT  students  sometimes delay  laundry  for a  few days.  Assume all  random 
values described below are mutually independent. 

(a)  A  busy  student must  complete  3 problem  sets before doing  laundry.  Each problem 
set  requires  1  day  with  probability  2/3  and  2  days  with  probability  1/3.  Let  B  be  the 
number of days a busy student delays laundry. What is E [B ]? 
Example:  If  the  ﬁrst  problem  set  requires  1  day  and  the  second  and  third  problem  sets 
each require 2 days, then the student delays for B  = 5  days. 

(b)  A relaxed student rolls a fair, 6­sided die in the morning.  If he rolls a 1, then he does 
his laundry immediately (with zero days of delay). Otherwise, he delays for one day and 
repeats  the  experiment  the  following  morning.  Let  R  be  the  number  of  days  a  relaxed 
student delays laundry. What is E [R]? 
Example:  If  the  student  rolls  a  2  the  ﬁrst morning,  a  5  the  second morning,  and  a  1  the 
third morning, then he delays for R  = 2  days. 

(c)  Before doing laundry, an unlucky student must recover from illness for a number of 
days  equal  to  the  product  of  the  numbers  rolled  on  two  fair,  6­sided  dice.  Let  U  be  the 
expected number of days an unlucky student delays laundry. What is E [U ]? 
Example:  If the rolls are 5 and 3, then the student delays for U  =  15  days. 

(d)  A  student  is  busy  with  probability  1/2,  relaxed  with  probability  1/3,  and  unlucky 
with probability  1/6.  Let D  be  the number  of days  the  student delays  laundry.  What  is 
E [D]?

Problem  2.  There  are  about  250,000,000  people  in  the  United  States  who  might  use  a 
phone.  Assume that each person is on the phone during each minute mutually indepen­
dently with probability p  = 0.01. 
(To keep  the problem simple, we are putting aside  the  fact  that people are on  the phone 
more often at certain times of day and on certain days of the year.) 

(a)  What is the expected number of people on the phone at a given moment? 

(b)  Suppose  that we  construct  a  phone  network whose  capacity  is  a mere  one  percent 
above  the  expectation.  Upper  bound  the  probability  that  the  network  is  overloaded  in 
a  given  minute.  (Use  the  approximation  formula  given  in  the  notes.  You  may  need  to 
evaluate  this  expression  in  a  clever  way  because  of  the  size  of  numbers  involved.  For 
example, you could ﬁrst evaluate the logarithm of the given expression.) 

(c)  What  is  the  expected  number  of minutes  (approximately)  until  the  system  is  over­
loaded for the ﬁrst time? 

Problem  3.  We  are  given  a  set  of  n  distinct  positive  integers.  We  then  determine  the 
maximum of these numbers by the following procedure: 
Randomly arrange the numbers in a sequence. 
Let the “current maximum” initially be the ﬁrst number in the sequence and the “current 
element”  be  the  second  element  of  the  sequence.  If  the  current  element  is  greater  than 
the current maximum, perform an “update”:  that  is, change the current maximum to be 
the current element.  Either way, change the current element to be the next element of the 
sequence. Repeat this process until there is no next element. 
Prove that the expected number of updates is ∼  ln   n. 
Hint:  Let Mi  be the indicator variable for the event that the ith element of the sequence is 
bigger than all the previous elements in the sequence. 

Problem 4.  In a certain card game, each card has a point value. 

•	 Numbered cards in the range 2 to 9 are worth ﬁve points each. 

•	 The  card  numbered  10  and  the  face  cards  (jack,  queen,  king)  are worth  ten  points 
each. 

•	 Aces are worth ﬁfteen points each.

(a)  Suppose that you thoroughly shufﬂe a 52­card deck. What is the expected total point 
value of the three cards on the top of the deck after the shufﬂe? 

(b)  Suppose that you throw out all the red cards and shufﬂe the remaining 26­card, all­
black deck. Now what is the expected total point value of the top three cards?  (Note that 
drawing three aces, for example, is now impossible!) 

Problem 5.  A true story from World War II: 
The  army  needs  to  identify  soldiers with  a disease  called  “klep”.  There  is  a way  to  test 
blood  to  determine whether  it  came  from  someone with  klep.  The  straightforward  ap­
proach is to test each soldier individually.  This requires n  tests, where n  is the number of 
soldiers.  A better  approach  is  the  following:  group  the  soldiers  into groups of  k .  Blend 
the blood  samples of each group and apply  the  test once  to each blended  sample.  If  the 
group­blend doesn’t have klep, we are done with that group after one test.  If the group­
blend  fails  the  test,  then someone  in  the group has klep, and we  individually  test all  the 
soldiers in the group. 
Assume each soldier has klep with probability, p, independently of all the other soldiers. 

(a)  What  is the expected number of tests as a function of n, p, and k?  (Assume for sim­
plicity that n  is divisible by k .) 

(b)  How  should  k  be  chosen  to minimize  the  expected  number  of  test  performed,  and 
what is the resulting expectation? 

(c)  What fraction of the work does the grouping method expect to save over the straight­
forward approach in a million­strong army where 1%  have klep? 

Problem 6.  The hat­check staff has had a long day, and at the end of the party they decide 
to  return  people’s  hats  at  random.  Suppose  that  n  people  have  their  hats  returned  at 
random.  We previously  showed  that  the expected number of people who get  their own 
hat back is 1, irrespective of the total number of people.  In this problem we will calculate 
� 
the variance in the number of people who get their hat back. 
Let  Xi  = 1  if  the  ith  person  gets  his  or  her  own  hat  back  and  0  otherwise.  Let  Sn  ::=  
n  Xi , so Sn  is the total number of people who get their own hat back.  Show that 
i=1 

(a)  E [Xi 
2 ] = 1/n. 
(b)  E [XiXj ]  = 1/n(n  − 1)  for i  =  j .

(c)  E [S 2 ]  = 2. Hint: Use (a) and (b).

(d)  Var [Sn ]  = 1.

(e)  Explain why you cannot use the variance of sums formula to calculate Var [Sn ]. 
(f)  Using Chebyshev’s Inequality, show that Pr {Sn  ≥ 11} ≤ .01  for any n ≥ 11. 

Problem 7.  Let R1  and R2  be independent random variables, and f1  and f2  be any func­
tions such that domain (fi ) =  codomain (Ri ) for i = 1, 2.  Prove that f1 (R1 ) and f2 (R2 ) are 
independent random variables. 

Problem  8.  Let A, B , C  be  events,  and  let  IA , IB , IC  be  the  corresponding  indicator vari­
ables. Prove that A, B , C are mutually independent iff the random variables IA , IB , IC  are 
mutually independent.
