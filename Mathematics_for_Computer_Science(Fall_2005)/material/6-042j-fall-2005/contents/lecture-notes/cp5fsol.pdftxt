Solutions to In-Class Problems Week 5, Fri. 

Problem 1.  Figures 1–4 show different pictures of planar graphs. 

(a)  For each picture, describe its faces by listing the cycles that form their boundaries. 
Solution.  Figs 1 & 2: abda, bcdb, abcda. Fig 3: abcdea, adea,abda,bcdb. Fig 4: abcda, abdea, abda, 
� 
adea. 

(b)  Which of  the pictured graphs are  isomorphic?  Which pictures  represent  the  same  (abstract) 
planar drawing? 
Solution.  Figs  1 &  2  have  the  same  face  boundaries,  so  are  different  pictures  of  the  same  planar 
drawing. Figs 3 & 4 both have four faces, but they are different, for example, Figs 3 has a face with 
� 
5 edges, but the longest boundary in Fig 4 has 4 edges. 

Problem 2.  Prove that in a drawing of a connected planar graph 

(a)  every edge is traversed exactly twice by the face boundaries. 
Solution.  By  induction  on  the  number,  n,  of  edges  in  a  planar  drawing.  Base  case  n  = 0  holds 
vacuously.  The  inductive  case  works  because  rule  (1)  adds  one  new  edge  which  is  traversed 
twice by the face in which it is drawn, and all other faces are unchanged, and rule (2) divides the 
boundary of one  face  into  two parts,  leaving  the number of edge  traversals on  them unchanged, 
� 
adds a traversal of a new edge to each part, and leaves all other faces unchanged. 

(b)  if the graph has 3 or more vertices, then every face has length at least 3 (more precisely, every 
face traverses edges at least 3 times).

Solution.  By induction on the number, n, of edges in a planar drawing. A connected graph with 3 
vertices must have at least 2 edges, so we begin with base case n = 2.  In this case the graph must 
be a 2 edge line graph; if its successive vertices are a, b, c, then it has a unique planar drawing with 
one face with boundary abcba which traverses each edge twice and so has length 4. 
The  inductive  case works because  rule  (1)  adds  2  to  the  length  of  one  face  and  leaves  the  others 
unchanged, and an edge added by rule (2) can only connect nonadjacent edges on a face bound-
ary.  This means  the  face across which  the  edge  is drawn must have had  length at  least 4 and  its 
boundary splits  into  into  two paths of  length at  least 2.  These paths each becomes  the boundary 
of a new  face by making one additional  traversal of  the new  edge,  ensuring  that both new  faces 
� 
have length at least 3. All other faces are unchanged by rule (2). 

Problem 3.  Suppose we consider planar graphs that may not be connected.  So in addition to the 
parameters v , e, f  of Euler ’s formula, we also have the number, c, of connected components in the 
graph.  In  this  case  a  face may  have  a  boundary  consisting  of  several  unconnected  cycles,  as  in 
Figure 5. 

(a)  Use the additional parameter, c, to state a generalized version of Euler ’s Formula that applies 
to possibly unconnected planar graphs. 
Solution. 

v − e + f  − c = 1.

(b)  Drawings  of  unconnected  graphs  use  two  additional  rules:  rule  (3):  add  a  new  vertex  of 
degree 0, and rule (4) add an edge between vertices on two different connected components. Using 
these rules, explain how to modify the inductive proof of Euler ’s formula to prove the generalized 
version. 
Solution.  By induction on the sum n = e + v .  The base case is n = 1, which means v  = 1,l e = 0, 
f  = 1 (just  the outer  face),  and  c  = 1,  and 1 − 0 + 1−  1 = 1 as  required.  The  inductive  case  for 
rules (1) and (2) is the same since they do not change c. Rule (3) increase c and v by 1 and leaves f 
and e unchanged, so v − e + f − c is unchanged. Rule (4) increases e by 1 and decreases c by 1 and 
leaves v and f  unchanged, so v − e + f  − c is again unchanged.
