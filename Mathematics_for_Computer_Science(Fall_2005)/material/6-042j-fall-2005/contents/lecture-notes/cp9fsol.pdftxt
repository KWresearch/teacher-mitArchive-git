Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 9, Fri.


Problem 1.  Solve  the  following problems using  the Pigeonhole Principle.  For  each problem,  try 
to identify the pigeons, the pigeonholes, and a rule assigning each pigeon to a pigeonhole. 

(a)  In a room of 500 people, there exist two who share a birthday. 

Solution.  The pigeons are the 500 people.  The pigeonholes are 366 possible birthdays. Map each 
person  to  his  or  her  own  birthday.  Since  there  500  people  and  366  birthdays,  some  two  people 
� 
must have the same birthday by the Pigeonhole Principle. 

(b)  Every MIT  ID  number  starts with  a  9  (we  think).  Suppose  that  each  of  the  101  students  in 
6.042  sums  the  nine  digits  of  his  or  her  ID  number  and  doubles  the  result.  Explain  why  two 
students’ results must be the same. 

Solution.  The students are the pigeons, the possible results are the pigeonholes, and we map each 
student to the result calculated from his or her MIT ID number.  Every sum is in the range from 9 
· 
to 9 +   8 9  = 81, and since results are obtained by doubling these sums, there are also 81 possible 
pigeonholes.  Since  there  are  more  pigeons  than  pigeonholes,  there  must  be  two  pigeons  in  the 
� 
same pigeonhole; in other words, there must be two students with the same result. 

(c)  In every set of 100 integers, there exist two whose difference is a multiple of 37. 

Solution.  The pigeons are the 100 integers. The pigeonholes are the numbers 0 to 36. Map integer 
k  to  k  rem  37.  Since  there  are  100 pigeons  and only  37 pigeonholes,  two pigeons must go  in  the 
same pigeonhole.  This means k1  rem  37  =  k2  rem  37, which  implies  that k1  − k2  is a multiple of 
� 
37. 

(d)  For any ﬁve points inside a unit square, there are two points at distance less than 

.√
1
2 
Solution.  The pigeons are the points. The pigeonholes are the four subsquares of the unit square, 
1
each  of  side  length  2 .  There  are  ﬁve  pigeons  and  four  pigeonholes,  and  a  pigeon  maps  to  the 
subsquare  it  is  in  (points  on  a  boundary  get  assigned  to  the  leftmost  lowest possible  subsquare)

√
so more  than one point must be  in  the  same  subsquare.  The points  in  the  same  subsquare are at 
distance less than 1/
2, because the most distant points in the quadrant are at opposite corners at 
√
exactly this distance, but only one of these corners can be inside the square (not on the boundary), 
� 
so the distance between the points in the quadrant must actually be less than 1/
2. 

(e)  For  any  ﬁve  points  inside  an  equilateral  triangle  of  side  length  2,  there  are  two  points  at 
distance less than 1. 

Solution.  The  pigeons  are  the  points.  The  pigeonholes  are  the  four  sub­equilateral  triangles  of 
side length 1.  There are ﬁve pigeons and four pigeonholes, so more than one point must be in the 
same  sub­equilateral  triangle.  Points  inside  the  same  sub­equilateral  triangle are at distance  less 
� 
than 1. 

(f)  Prove  that  every  ﬁnite  undirected  graph  with  two  or  more  vertices  has  two  vertices  of  the 
same degree. 
Solution.  Suppose a graph has n  ≥  2  vertices.  Hence, the vertex degrees must be between 0 and 
n  − 1,  inclusive.  However,  both  0  and n  − 1  cannot both occur:  if  there  is  an  isolated  (degree  0) 
vertex,  then  the  remaining vertices can have degree at most n  − 2.  So  in no graph are  there ever 
more than n  − 1  possible degree values.  Since there are n  vertices, and at most n  − 1  degrees, the 
� 
Pigeonhole Principle implies there must be two vertices with the same degree. 

Problem  2.  Your  6.001  tutorial  has  12  students,  who  are  supposed  to  break  up  into  4  groups  of 
3  students  each.  Your  TA  has  observed  that  the  students  waste  too  much  time  trying  to  form 
balanced groups, so he decided to pre­assign students to groups and email the group assignments 
to his students. 

(a)  Your  TA  has  a  list  of  the  12  students  in  front  of  him,  so  he  divides  the  list  into  consecutive 
groups of 3.  For example,  if  the  list  is ABCDEFGHIJKL,  the TA would deﬁne a sequence of  four 
groups  to  be  ({A, B , C } , {D , E , F } , {G, H, I } , {J, K, L}).  This way  of  forming  groups  deﬁnes  a 
mapping from a list of twelve students to a sequence of four groups.  This is a k­to­1 mapping for 
what k? 

Solution.  Two  lists map  to  the  same  sequence  of  groups  iff  the  ﬁrst  3  students  are  the  same  on 
both lists, and likewise for the second, third, and fourth consecutive sublists of 3 students.  So for 
a given sequence of 4 groups, the number of lists which map to it is 

because there are 3!  ways to order the students in each of the 4 consecutive sublists.

(b)  A  group  assignment  speciﬁes  which  students  are  in  the  same  group,  but  not  any  order  in 
which the groups should be listed.  If we map a sequence of 4 groups, 
({A, B , C } , {D , E , F } , {G, H, I } , {J, K, L}), 

into a group assignment 

{{A, B , C } , {D , E , F } , {G, H, I } , {J, K, L}} , 

this mapping is j ­to­1 for what j ? 

Solution.  4!.

(c)  How many group assignments are possible? 

Solution. 

12!  
4!   · (3!)4 

=  15400

different assignments. 
There are 12!  possible lists of students, and we can map each list to an assignment by ﬁrst mapping 
� 
� 
the list to a sequence of four groups, and then mapping the sequence to the assignment.  Since the 
· 
ﬁrst map is (3!)4 ­to­1 and and the second is 4!­to­1, the composite map is (3!)4  4!­to­1.  So by the 
· 
�
Division Rule, 12!  =  (3!)4  4!  A  where A  is the number of assignments. 

(d)  In how many ways can 3n  students be broken up into n  groups of 3? 

Solution. 

(3n)! 
.
(3!)nn!
This follows simply but replacing “12” by “3n” in the solution to the previous problem parts.  � 

Problem 3.  Answer the following quesions using the Generalized Product Rule. 

(a)  Next week, I’m going to get really ﬁt! On day 1, I’ll exercise for 5 minutes. On each subsequent 
day,  I’ll  exercise  0,  1,  2,  or  3  minutes  more  than  the  previous  day.  For  example,  the  number  of 
minutes  that  I  exercise  on  the  seven  days  of  next week might  be  5,  6,  9,  9,  9,  11,  12.  How many 
such sequences are possible? 

Solution.  The number of minutes on the ﬁrst day can be selected in 1 way. The number of minutes 
on each subsequent day can be selected in 4 ways.  Therefore, the number of exercise sequences is 
· 
�
1 46  by the extended product rule.

(b)  An r­permutation of a set  is a sequence of r  distinct elements of  that set.  For example, here 
are all the 2­permutations of {a, b, c, d}: 

(a, b) 
(b, a) 
(c, a) 
(d, a) 

(a, c) 
(b, c) 
(c, b) 
(d, b) 

(a, d) 
(b, d) 
(c, d) 
(d, c) 

How  many  r­permutations  of  an  n­element  set  are  there?  Express  your  answer  using  factorial 
notation. 
Solution.  There  are  n  ways  to  choose  the  ﬁrst  element,  n − 1 ways  to  choose  the  second,  n − 2 
ways to choose the third, . . . , and n − r + 1 ways to choose the r­th element. Thus, there are: 
n!  
(n − r)! 

n · (n − 1) · (n − 2) · · · (n − r + 1) =

r­permutations of an n­element set. 

� 

(c)  How many n × n matrices are there with distinct entries drawn from {1, . . . , p}, where p ≥ n
2 ?
Solution.  There are p ways to choose the ﬁrst entry, p − 1 ways to choose the second for each way 
of choosing the ﬁrst, p − 2 ways of choosing the third, and so forth.  In all there are 
p! 
(p − n2 )! 

p(p − 1)(p − 2) · · · (p − n 2  + 1) =

such matrices.  Alternatively,  this  is  the  number  of  n2 ­permutations  of  a  p element  set,  which  is 
p!/(p − n2 )!.

Problem 4.  A certain company wants  to have security  for  their computer systems.  So  they have 
given everyone a name and password. A length 10 word containing each of the characters: 

a, d, e, f, i, l, o, p, r, s, 

is called a cword. A password will be a cword which does not contain any of the subwords ”fails”, 
”failed”, or ”drop”. 
For example, the following two words are passwords: 

adeﬁloprs, srpolifeda, 

but the following three cwords are not: 

Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 9, Fri. 

adropeﬂrs, failedrops, dropefails. 

(a)  How many cwords contain the subword “drop”? 

5 

Solution.  Such  cwords  are  obtainable  by  taking  the word  “drop”  and  the  remaining  6  letters  in 
� 
any order. There are 7!  permutations of these 7 items. 

(b)  How many cwords contain both “drop” and “fails”? 

Solution.  Take  the words “drop” and “fails” and  the  remaining  letter “e”  in any order.  So  there 
� 
are 3!  such cwords. 

(c)  Use the Inclusion­exclusion Principle to ﬁnd a simple formula for the number of passwords. 

Solution.  There  are  7!  cwords  that  contain  “drop”,  6!   that  contain  “fails”,  and  5!  that  contain 
“failed”.  There  are  3!  cwords  containing  both  “drop”  and  “fails”.  No  cword  can  contain  both 
“fails” and “failed”.  The cwords containing both “drop” and “failed” come from taking the sub­
word “failedrop” and the remaining letter “s” in any order, so there are 2!  of them. So by Inclusion­
exclusion, we have the number of cwords containing at least one of the three forbidden subwords 
is 
(7!  +  6!  +   5!)  − (3!  +  0 +  2!)  +  0  =  5!(48)  − 8. 
Among the 10!  cwords, the remaining ones are passwords, so the number of passwords is 
10!  − 5!(48)  +  8  = 3,  623,  048.
