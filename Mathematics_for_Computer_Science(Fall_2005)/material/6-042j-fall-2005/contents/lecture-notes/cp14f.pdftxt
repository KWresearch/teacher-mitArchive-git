Problem  1.  A  prison  warden  has  two  holding  cells,  Cell  1  and  Cell  2,  for  his  prison­
ers. Unfortunately, many pairs of these prisoners are incompatible, and there will be some 
trouble  if an  incompatible pair are  in  the same cell.  The warden would  like  to minimize 
trouble  by  not  having  too many  incompatible  pairs  in  the  same  cell.  Unfortunately,  the 
warden has no idea how to split the up prisoners, and so he decides to go with a random 
assignment:  he will assign prisoners to one cell or the other by successive (independent) 
ﬂips of a fair coin. 
For any two incompatible prisoners, a,  b, let Ta,b  be 1  if a  and b  are placed in the same cell, 
and 0  otherwise. 

(a)  What is the expected value of Ta,b? 

Suppose there are n  incompatible sets of prisoners, a,  b. The total trouble, T , of an assign­
ment of prisoners to cells is the sum of Ta,b  where the sum is over the n  sets of incompatible 
prisoners a  =�
b.  So T  is the total number of incompatible sets of two prisoners that are in 
the same cell. The warden hopes to minimize the total trouble, T . 

(b)  What is the expected value of T ? 

(c)  Explain  why  there  must  be  a  split  of  the  prisoners  between  cells  that  separates  at 
least half the incompatible pairs. 

(d)  Suppose  a,  b,  c  are  different  prisoners,  where  a  and  b  are  incompatible,  and  a  and  c 
are also incompatible. Explain why Ta,b  is independent of Ta,c . Conclude that set of all the 
Ta,b ’s is pairwise independent. 

(e)  Are the Ta,b ’s mutually independent? 

(f)  What is the variance of T ? 

(g)  Suppose among 1000 prisoners, about a ﬁfth of the pairs, say 100,000 pairs, turn out 
to  be  incompatible.  Show  that  there  is  at most  a  10%  chance  that  the warden’s  random 
assignment differs by more  than 1%  from  the expected number of  incompatible pairs  in 
the same cell. Hint: Chebyshev.

Problem 2.  Now we look at the situation in the previous problem in more detail. Suppose 
there are levels of conﬂict between incompatible prisoners, where the conﬂict level of two 
prisoners who may hate each other ’s guts is 1 if they wouldn’t actually touch each other, 
2  if  they might hurt each other but wouldn’t cause a  trip  to  the hospital, and 3  if having 
them  in  the same cell would be really bad.  Suppose we model  the situation by assuming 
that a  random  conﬂict  level wa,b  equal  to 1,2,  or 3  is assigned  to every  two  incompatible 
prisoners, a,  b, uniformly and independently of all other conﬂict levels. 
� 
So  Ta,bwa,b  is  0  if  a,  b   are  placed  in  different  cells  and  is  wa,b  otherwise.  Deﬁne  the  total 
conﬂict to be 
Ta,bwa,b , 
a,b  incompatible 
that is, the sum of the levels of conﬂicting pairs in which the members are assigned to the 
same cell. We would like the total conﬂict to be small. 

C  ::= 

(a)  What is the expected value of wa,b  and Ta,bwa.b? 

(b)  What is the variance of wa,b  and Ta,bwa,b? 

(c)  What is the expected value of C ? 

(d)  Are the Ta,bwa,b ’s pairwise independent?  . . . mutually independent? 

(e)  What is the variance of C ? 
(f)  What does Chebyshev’s inequality give for a bound on Pr {|C  − E [C ]|} > n/4? 
(g)  Suppose someone complains about our modeling the situation as choosing a random 
conﬂict  level  of  1,2,  or  3,  and  agrees  only  that  conﬂict  levels  range  between  1  and  3.  So 
then the w’s for different incompatible pairs may have different distributions, but we still 
assume  they  are  independent.  Could  we  still  use  Chebyshev’s  inequality  to  say  some­
thing  about  the  probability  of  deviating  from  the mean?  Hint:  :  What  is  the maximum 
possible variance for a random variable with values between 0 and 3?

Problem  3.  A  recent  Gallup  poll  found  that  35%  of  the  adult  population  of  the  United 
States believes  that  the  theory of evolution  is “well­supported by  the evidence”.  Gallup 
polled 1928 people and claims a margin of error of 3 percentage points. 
Let’s  check Gallup’s  claim.  Suppose  that  there are m  adult Americans,  of whom pm  be­
lieve in evolution; this means that (1 − p)m  Americans do not believe in evolution. Gallup 
polls 1928  Americans selected uniformly and independently at random. Of these, 675  be­
lieve in evolution, leading to Gallup’s estimate that the fraction of Americans who believe 
in evolution is within 0.03 of 675/1928  ≈ 0.350. 

(a)  Explain how  to use  the Binomial Sampling Theorem  (available  in  the Appendix)  to 
determine the conﬁdence level with which Gallup can make his claim. You do not actually 
have to do the calculation, but are welcome to if you have the means. 

(b)  If we accept all of Gallup’s polling data and calculations, can we conclude that there 
is a high probability that the number of adult Americans who believe in evolution is 35± 3 
percent? 

(c)  Explaining Sampling to a Jury The calculation above revealed that, based on a poll 
of  1928  people,  we  can  be  highly  conﬁdent  that  the  per  cent  of  people  in  the  U.S.  who 
believe  in  evolution  is  35%  ± 3%.  Note  that  the  actual population of  the U.S. was never 
considered, because it did not matter! 
Suppose you were going to serve as an expert witness in a trial. How would you explain 
to a jury why the number of people necessary to poll does not depend on the population size? 
(Begin  by  explaining  why  it  is  reasonable  to model  polling  as  independent  coin  tosses. 
Remember  that  juries do not understand  algebra or  equations;  you might be ok using  a 
little arithmetic.)
