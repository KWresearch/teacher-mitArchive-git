In-Class Problems Week 5, Fri. 

Problem 1.  Figures 1–4 show different pictures of planar graphs. 

(a)  For each picture, describe its faces by listing the cycles that form their boundaries. 
(b)  Which of  the pictured graphs are  isomorphic?  Which pictures  represent  the  same  (abstract) 
planar drawing? 

Problem 2.  Prove that in a drawing of a connected planar graph 

(a)  every edge is traversed exactly twice by the face boundaries. 
(b)  if the graph has 3 or more vertices, then every face has length at least 3 (more precisely, every 
face traverses edges at least 3 times). 

Problem 3.  Suppose we consider planar graphs that may not be connected.  So in addition to the 
parameters v , e, f  of Euler ’s formula, we also have the number, c, of connected components in the 
graph.  In  this  case  a  face may  have  a  boundary  consisting  of  several  unconnected  cycles,  as  in 
Figure 5. 

(a)  Use the additional parameter, c, to state a generalized version of Euler ’s Formula that applies 
to possibly unconnected planar graphs. 
(b)  Drawings  of  unconnected  graphs  use  two  additional  rules:  rule  (3):  add  a  new  vertex  of 
degree 0, and rule (4) add an edge between vertices on two different connected components. Using 
these rules, explain how to modify the inductive proof of Euler ’s formula to prove the generalized 
version.
