Problem 1.  A couple decides  to have children until  they have both a boy and a girl.  What  is  the 
expected number of children that they’ll end up with?  Assume that each child is equally likely to 
be a boy or a girl and genders are mutually independent. 

Problem  2.  There  is  a  nice  formula  for  the  expected  value  of  a  random  variable R that  takes  on 
� 
only nonnegative integer values: 
∞
Pr {R > k}
k=0 

E [R] = 

Suppose  we  roll  6  fair,  independent  dice.  Let  R be  the  largest  number  that  comes  up.  Use  the 
formula above to compute E [R].

Problem 3.  A classroom has sixteen desks arranged as shown below. 

If  there  is  a  girl  in  front,  behind,  to  the  left,  or  to  the  right  of  a  boy,  then  the  two  of  them  ﬂirt. 
One  student may  be  in multiple  ﬂirting  couples;  for  example,  a  student  in  a  corner  of  the  class­
room can ﬂirt with up  to  two others, while a  student  in  the center can ﬂirt with as many as  four 
others.  Suppose  that  desks  are  occupied  by  boys  and  girls with  equal  probability  and mutually 
independently. What is the expected number of ﬂirting couples?
