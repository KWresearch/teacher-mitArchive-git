Problem 1.  Given an unlimited  supply of 3  cent and 5 cent  stamps, what postages are possible? 
Prove it using Strong Induction.  Hint:  Try some examples!  Which postage values between 1 and 
25 cents can you construct from 3 cent and 5 cent stamps? 
Solution.  Let’s  use  our  examples  to  ﬁrst  try  to  guess  the  answer  and  then  try  to  prove  it.  Let’s 
begin ﬁlling  in a  table  that shows  the values of all possible combinations of 3 and 5 cent stamps. 
The column heading is the number of 5 cent stamps and the row heading is the number of 3 cent 
stamps.

Looking  at  the  table,  a  reasonable guess  is  that  the possible postages  are  0,  3,  5,  and  6  cents  and 
every value of 8 or more cents. Let’s try to prove this last part using strong induction. 
Claim 1.1.  For all n ≥ 8, it is possible to produce n cents of postage from 3¢ and 5¢ stamps. 

Now let’s preview the proof. The induction hypothesis will be 
if n ≥ 8,  then n¢ postage can be produced using 3¢ and 5¢ stamps 
::= 
P (n) 

(1) 

A proof by strong induction will have the same ﬁve­part structure as an ordinary induction proof. 
The base case, P (0), won’t be interesting because P (n) is vacuously true for all n < 8. 
In the inductive step we have to show how to produce n + 1 cents of postage, assuming the strong 
induction  hypothesis  that we  know  how  to  produce  k¢  of  postage  for  all  values  of  k between  8 
and n. A simple way to do this is to let k =  n − 2  and produce k¢ of postage; then add a 3¢ stamp 
to get n +  1 cents. 
But we have  to be  careful;  there  is a pitfall  in  this method.  If n +  1  is 8,  9 or 10,  then we  can not 
use the trick of creating n + 1 cents of postage from n − 2 cents and a 3 cent stamp.  In these cases, 
n − 2  is less than 8. None of the strong induction assumptions help us make less than 8¢ postage. 
Fortunately, making n +  1  cents of postage in these three cases can be easily done directly.

Proof.  The proof is by strong induction. The induction hypothesis, P (n), is given by (1).

Base case: n = 0: P (0) is true vacuously.

Inductive  step:  In  the  inductive  step,  we  assume  that  it  is  possible  to  produce  postage  worth 

8, 9, . . . , n cents in order to prove that it is possible to produce postage worth n + 1 cents. 
There are four cases: 

1. 	 n + 1 < 8:  So P (n + 1) holds vacuously. 

2. 	 n + 1 =  8: P (n + 1) holds because we produce 8¢ postage using one 3¢ and one 5¢ stamp. 

3. 	 n + 1 =  9: P (n + 1) holds by using three 3¢ stamps. 

4. 	 n + 1 =  10: P (n + 1) holds by using two 5¢ stamps. 
5. 	 n + 1 >  10:  We  have  n  ≥  10,  so  n − 2 ≥  8 and  by  strong  induction  we  may  assume  we 
can  produce  exactly  n − 2 cents  of  postage.  With  an  additional  3¢  stamp we  can  therefore 
produce n + 1 cents of postage. 

So  in  every  case,  P (0) ∧ P (1) ∧ . . . P (
n) −→  P (
n + 1).  By  strong  induction, we have  concluded 
that P (n) is true for all n ∈ N.

Problem  2.  Use  the Well­ordering  Principle  to  prove  that  there  is  no  solution  over  the  positive 
integers to the equation: 

4a 3  + 2b3  =  c .  
3

Solution.  We  use  contradiction  and  the well­ordering  principle.  Let  S  be  the  set  of  all  positive 
integers, a, such that there exist positive integers, b, and, c, that satisfy the equation. 
Assume for the purpose of obtaining a contradiction that S is nonempty. Then S contains a small­
est  element,  a0 ,  by  the well­ordering principle.  By  the deﬁnition  of S ,  there  exist  corresponding 
positive integers, b0 , and, c0 , such that: 

4a0  + 2b3  = c0

The left side of this equation is even, so c0  is even, and therefore c0  is also even.  Thus, there exists 
an integer, c1 , such that c0  = 2c1 .  Substituting into the preceding equation and then dividing both 
sides by 2 gives: 

2a0  + b3  = 4c1

0  must be even, so b0  is even.  Thus, there exists an integer, b1 , such that b0  =  2b1 .  Substitut­
Now b3 
ing into the preceding equation and dividing both sides by 2 again gives: 

a0  + 4b3  = 2c1

From  this equation, we know  that a0  is even,  so a0  is also even.  Thus,  there exists an  integer, a1 , 
such  that  a0  =  2a1 .  Substituting  into  the previous  equation  one  last  time  and dividing by  2  one 
last time gives: 

4a1  + 2b3  = c1

Evidently, a  =  a1 ,  b  =  b1 ,  and c  =  c1  is another solution  to  the original equation,  and so a1  is an 
element  of S .  But  this  is  a  contradiction,  because  a1  <  a0  and  a0  was deﬁned  to  be  the  smallest 
element of S .  Therefore,  our assumption was wrong,  and  the original  equation has no  solutions 
over the positive integers.

This argument is quite similar to the proof that
