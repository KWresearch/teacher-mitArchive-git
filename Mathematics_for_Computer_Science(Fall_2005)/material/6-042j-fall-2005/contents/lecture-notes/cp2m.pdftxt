2 is an irrational number.

Proof.  The  proof  is  by  contradiction.  Assume  for purpose  of  contradiction  that

2 =   m/n  where m  and n  are integers and the fraction is in lowest 
Then we can write 
terms. Squaring both sides gives 2 =  m2/n2 , so 2n2  =  m2 . This implies that m2  is even, 
and hence that m  is even;  that is, m  is a multiple of 2.  But that means m2  is actually a 
multiple of 4, say m2  = 4k . 
Now we have 2n2  =  m2  = 4k , so n2  = 2k .  So n2  is even, and hence n  is even. But since 
m  and n  are both even, the fraction m/n  is not in lowest terms, a contradiction.

Problem 2.  1  A set of propositions is consistent if there is a possible situation in which they are all 
true. This problem examines whether the following speciﬁcations are consistent. 

1.  If the ﬁle system is not locked, then 

(a)  new messages will be queued. 
(b)  new messages will be sent to the messages buffer. 
(c)  the  system  is  functioning  normally,  and  conversely,  if  the  system  is  functioning  nor­
mally, then the ﬁle system is not locked. 

2.  If new messages are not queued, then they will be sent to the messages buffer. 

3.  New messages will not be sent to the message buffer. 

(a)  Begin  by  translating  the  parts  of  the  speciﬁcation  into  propositional  formulas  using  four 
propositional variables: 

L 

Q 

B 

N 

::=  ﬁle system locked,

::=  new messages are queued,

::=  new messages are sent to the message buffer,

::= 
system functioning normally.


(b)  To  be precise,  the  speciﬁcation  is  consistent  if  there  is  a  single  choice  of  truth  values  for  the 
variables L, Q, B , N , so that every one the propositional formulas from the previous part are true. 
Explain how to use a truth table to determine whether the speciﬁcation is consistent. 

(c)  Use simple reasoning by cases to ﬁnd a truth assignment that conﬁrms that this system speciﬁ­
cation is consistent. Explain why there is only one such assignment. 

Problem  3.  If  we  raise  an  irrational  number  to  an  irrational  power,  can  the  result  be  rational?
