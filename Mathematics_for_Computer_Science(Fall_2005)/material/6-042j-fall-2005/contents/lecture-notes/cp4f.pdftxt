In­Class Problems Week 4, Fri. 
Problem 1.  (a)  For any vertex, v , in a graph, let v� be the set of vertices adjacent to v , that is, 
� 
� 
�
v  ::=  v �  | v—v �  is an edge of the graph  . 
�
Suppose f  is an isomorphism from graph G  to graph H . Carefully prove that f (v�) =  f (v). 
(b)  Conclude  that  if G  and H  are  isomorphic  graphs,  then  for  each  k  ∈  N,  they  have  the  same 
number of degree k  vertices. 

Problem  2.  For  each of  the  following pairs of graphs,  either deﬁne  an  isomomorphism between 
them, or prove that there is none.  (We write ab  as shorthand for a—b.)

Problem 3.  Extra Problem. 

(a)  Exhibit three nonisomorphic, connected graphs with ﬁve vertices and four edges. 

(b)  Argue that every connected graph with ﬁve vertices and four edges  is  isomomorphic to one 
of the three in part (a).
