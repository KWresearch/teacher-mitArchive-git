Problem  1.  Suppose  you  have  learned  that  the  average  graduating MIT  student’s  total 
number of credits is 200. 

(a)  Knowing  only  this  average,  use  Markov’s  inequality  to  ﬁnd  a  best  possible  upper 
bound for the fraction of MIT students graduating with at least 235 credits.  1 

(b)  Demonstrate that this is a best possible bound by giving a distribution for which this 
bound holds with equality. 

(c)  Suppose  you  are now  told  that  no  student  can  graduate with  fewer  than  170 units. 
How does  this allow you  to  improve your previous bound?  As before,  show  that  this  is 
the best possible bound. 

(d)  Now  suppose  you  further  learn  that  the  standard  deviation  of  the  total  credits  per 
graduating  student  is  7.  What  is  the Chebyshev  bound  on  the  fraction  of  students who 
can graduate with at least 235 credits? 

Problem 2.  (a)  Show that Markov’s Theorem only applies to nonnegative random vari­
ables.  That is, give an example of a random variable to which Markov’s Theorem gives a 
wrong answer. 
(b)  Suppose  R  is  a  random  variable  that  is  always  at  least  −10  and  has  expectation  0. 
Since R  may be negative, Markov’s  theorem does not apply directly.  Still, use Markov’s 
theorem to show that the probability that R  is ≥ 5  is at most 2/3.

1 Ignore the fact that there are practical limits to the amount of time a student can stay at MIT and remain 
sane; That is, assume that there is no bound on the number of credits a student may earn.

Problem  3.  There  are  n  people  at  a  circular  table  in  a Chinese  restaurant.  On  the  table, 
there are n different appetizers arranged on a big Lazy Susan. Each person starts munch­
ing on  the appetizer directly  in  front of him or her.  Then someone spins  the Lazy Susan 
so  that  everyone  is  faced  with  a  random  appetizer.  In  class,  we  saw  that  the  expected 
� 
number of people that end up with the appetizer that they had originally is 1. 
Let Xi  be  the  indicator variable  for  the  ith person getting  their own  appetizer back.  Let 
n
Sn  be the total number of people who get their own appetizer back, so Sn  = 
Xi .

(a)  What is E [X 2 ]?i 
(b)  For i =�
(c)  What is E [S 2 ]?n
(d)  What is Var [Sn ]? 

(e)  Discuss  the accuracy of  the Chebyshev Bound on  the probability  that Sn  is distance 
x from its expectation as x ranges over integers between 1 and n. 

Problem 4.  For any random variable, R, with E [R] =  µ and Var [R] =  v ,  the Chebyshev 
Bound says that for any real number x > 0, 
Pr {|R − µ| ≥ x} ≤ 

v 
. 2 
x
Show that for any real number, µ, and real numbers v , x  >  0,  there is an R for which the 
Chebyshev Bound is tight, that is, 

Pr {|R| ≥ x} 
v 
= 
.

Hint: Assume µ =  0 and let R be three valued with values 0, −x, and x.

Problem 5.  The covariance, Cov [X, Y ], of two random variables, X and Y ,  is deﬁned to 
be  E [X Y ] − E [X ] E [Y ].  Note  that  if  two  random  variables  are  independent,  then  their 
covariance is zero. 

(a)  Give an example to show that having Cov [X, Y ] =  0 does not necessarily mean that 
X and Y  are independent.
