Problem 1.  Prove that asymptotic equality (∼) is an equivalence relation. 

Problem 2.  Recall that for functions f , g on the natural numbers, N, f  = O(g) iff 
∃c ∈ N ∃n0  ∈ N ∀n ≥ n0  c · g(n) ≥ |f (n) .

For  each  pair  of  functions  below,  determine whether  f  =  O(g)  and whether  g  =  O(f ).  In  cases 
where one function is O() of the other, indicate the smallest natural number, c, and for that smallest 
c, the smallest corresponding natural number n0  ensuring that condition (1) applies.

Problem  3.  Indicate  which  of  the  following  holds  for  each  pair  of  functions  (f (n), g(n))  in  the 
table below. Assume k ≥ 1, � > 0, and c > 1 are constants. Be prepared to justify your answers. 
f  = O(g)  f  = o(g)  g = O(f )  g = o(f )  f  = Θ(g)  f  ∼ g

Problem 4.  It is a standard fallacy to think that given n quantities each of which is O(1), their sum 
would have to be O(n). 
Namely, let f1 , f2 , . . .  be a sequence of functions from N to N, and let 
� 
n
S (n) ::= 
fi (n). 
i=1 

� 
� 
Then given that fi  = O(1) for every fi  in the sequence, we can try to argue as follows: 
n
n
O(1) = n · O(1) = O(n). 
fi (n) = 
i=1 
i=1 

S (n) = 

This informal argument may seem plausible, but is fundamentally ﬂawed because it treats O(1) as 
some kind numerical quantity.  In fact, we ask you to show that there is no way to determine how 
fast the sum, S (n), may grow. 
Namely, let g be any function on N.  Explain how to deﬁne a sequence of functions f1 , f2 , . . .  such 
that each fi  = O(1), but S  is not O(g). Hint: Let fi (n) ::= 1 + ig(i).

Asymptotic Notations

For functions f , g  : R

→ 

R, we say f  is asymptotically equal to g , in symbols, 
f (x) ∼ g(x) 

iff 

For functions f , g  : R

→ 

lim  f (x)/g(x) = 1. 
x→∞ 
R, we say f  is asymptotically smaller than g , in symbols, 

f (x) = o(g(x)), 

iff 

lim  f (x)/g(x) = 0. 
x→∞ 
Given functions f , g  : R  �→ R, with g nonnegative, we say that1 

iff 

f  = O(g) 

lim sup  f (x) /g(x) < ∞.
|

x→∞ 

An alternative, equivalent, deﬁnition is 

f  = O(g) 
iff there exists a constant c ≥ 0 and an x0  such that for all x ≥ x0 ,  f (x) ≤ cg(x).
|
| 
Finally, we say 

f  = Θ(g) 

iff  f  = O(g) ∧ g = O(f ).
