Problem 1.  Identify exactly where the bugs are in each of the following bogus proofs.1 

(a)  1/8 > 1/4. 

Bogus proof. 

3 > 2 
3 log10 (1/2) > 2 log10 (1/2) 
log10 (1/2)3  > log10 (1/2)2 
(1/2)3  > (1/2)2 , 

and the claim now follows by the rules for multiplying fractions. 

(b)  1¢ = $0.01 = ($0.1)2  = (10¢)2  = 100¢ = $1.

Problem 2.


In­Class Problems Week 1, Wed. 

Proposition (Arithmetic­Geometric Mean Inequality).  For all nonnegative real numbers a and b

a + b  √
≥ 
2 

ab.

What is wrong with the following proof of this proposition? 

Bogus proof. 

a + b  √
≥ 
?
ab
2 
√
a + b ≥ 2
? 
ab 
a 2  + 2ab + b2  ≥ 4ab 
? 
2 a  − 2ab + b2  ≥ 0 
? 
(a − b) ≥ 0 
2

The last statement is true because a − b is a real number, and the square of a real number is never 
negative. This proves the claim.
