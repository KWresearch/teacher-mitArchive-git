• Start:  n boxes in one stack 
n=a+b 
•  Move: pick any stack, divide into two 
nonempty stacks
•	 Scoring: if chosen stack is of size a+b 
and you divide into two stacks of size a 
and b, you get ab points 
•	 Overall score:  total sum of scores for 
each move

Ordinary Induction 
Ordinary induction allows proving

Why? 
Seems unfair, since started at 0, 
then showed 
0 → 1, 1 → 2, 2 → 3, …, n-1 → n. 
So by the time we got to  +1,already 
n
know all of 
P(0), P(1), …, P(n) 
.

Strong vs. Ordinary 
Induction 
MetaTheorem: Can transform any Strong 
Induction proof into Ordinary Induction. 
Reprove by ordinary induction using 
induction hypothesis:  Q(n) ::=  ∀k ≤ n P(k) 

Earlier Strong Induction now goes 
through by Ordinary Induction.

Well-ordering principle

Every nonempty set of 
nonnegative integers 
has a 
least element. 
Now you mention it, Yes.

Yes.

Yes. But watch out:

Proof using well-order principle 

Proof using well-order principle 

Theorem:  2 
is irrational.

Proof (by contradiction):  


• Suppose  2  was rational. 
• Choose m, n integers without common   
prime factors (always possible) such that 
m 
2 = 
n 
• Show that m & n are both even, 

a contradiction!

•  Choose m, n integers without common   
prime factors (always possible) 
•  WHY IS IT ALWAYS POSSIBLE? 
First:  can assume m≥0 
Next:  by WOP, pick minimum m0  such 
that q=m0/n0  for some n0 
If m0  and n0  had common factor p then 
could write q=(m0/p)/(n0/p) 
Contradicts minimality of m0!

Well-ordering principle
Theorem: Every integer > 1 is a product 

of primes.


Proof:   (by contradiction) Suppose not. 

Then set of nonproducts is nonempty.

By WOP, there is a least n > 1 that is not

a product of primes. 

In particular, n is not prime.


Well-ordering principle
Theorem: Every integer > 1 is a product 
of primes. 
Proof: …So n = k·m for integers k, m

where n > k,m >1.

Since k,m smaller than the least 

nonproduct, both are prime products, eg.,

k = p1 ⋅p2 ⋅⋅⋅p94 
m = q1 ⋅q2 ⋅⋅⋅ q214

Well-ordering principle 
Theorem: Every integer > 1 is a product 
of primes. 

…So 
n = k⋅m = p1 ⋅p2 ⋅⋅⋅p94 ⋅q1 ⋅q2 ⋅⋅⋅q214 
is a prime product, a contradiction. 
∴  The set of nonproducts > 1 
must be empty.
