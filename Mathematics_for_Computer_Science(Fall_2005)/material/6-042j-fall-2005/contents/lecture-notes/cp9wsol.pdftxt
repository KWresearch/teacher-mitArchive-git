Problem 1.  A license plate consists of either: 

•  3 letters followed by 3 digits (standard plate) 

•  5 letters (vanity plate) 

•  2 characters – letters or numbers (big shot plate) 

Let L be the set of all possible license plates. 

(a)  Express L in terms of 

A =  {A, B , C, . . . , Z } 
D =  {0, 1, 2, . . . , 9} 

using unions (∪) and set products (×). 
Solution. 

L = (A3  × D3 ) ∪ A5  ∪ (A ∪ D)2

Problem 2.  Let p be a prime and k a positive integer. 

(a)  How many positive integers less than pk  are divisible by p? 
Solution.  Every  pth  integer  is  divisible  by  p,  namely  p, 2p, 3p, . . . (pk−1  −  1)p,  so  the  answer  is 
pk−1  − 1. 
� 

(b)  What is the value, φ(pk ), of the Euler function at pk ? 
Solution.  There are pk  − 1  positive  integers  less  than pk ,  of which pk−1  − 1  are divisible by p by 
part  (a),  and  φ(pk ) are  relatively  prime  to  pk  by  deﬁnition  of  Euler ’s  function.  But  a  number  is 
relatively prime to pk  iff it is not divisible by p, so 
(p k−1  − 1)  +  φ(p k ) =  p  − 1 
k

by the Sum Rule. Therefore, 

φ(p k ) =  p

k  − p k−1

Problem  3.  For  each part below,  describe  a bijection between  the  two  sets mentioned.  The  exis­
tence of such a bijection proves that the two sets are the same size. 
A  good  approach  is  to  describe  an  element  of  the  ﬁrst  set  using  variables  and  then  describe  the 
corresponding  element of  the  second  set  in  terms of  those variables.  For example, we might de­
scribe  a  bijecton  from ways  of  selecting  a  dozen  doughnuts  from  ﬁve  varieties  to  a  16­bit  string 
with four 1’s as follows: 

Map a dozen doughnuts consisting of: 

c chocolate, l lemon­ﬁlled, s sugar, g glazed, and p plain 
to the sequence:

Everyone in your group should write out complete answers— you’ll all beneﬁt from the practice! 

(a)  Describe a bijection between the set of 30­bit sequences with 10 zeros and 20 ones and paths

(b)  Find a bijection between the set of n­bit sequences and the set of all subsets of {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn}. 
Solution.  Map the n­bit sequence b1 b2  . . . bn  to a subset that contains xi  if and only if bi  = 1.  � 

(c)  Mr.  and Mrs.  Grumperson  have  collected  13  identical  pieces  of  coal  as  Christmas  presents 
for  their  beloved  children,  Lucy  and  Spud.  Describe  a  bijection  between  the  set  of  all  ways  of 
distributing  the  13  coal  pieces  to  the  two  children  and  the  set  of  14­bit  sequences with  exactly  1 
one. 
Solution.  Map a distribution in which Lucy get l pieces and Spud gets s pieces to a 14­bit sequence 
� 
with l zeros, a one, and then s zeros. 

(d)  On Christmas Eve, Mr.  and Mrs.  Grumperson  remember  that  they have  a  third  child,  little 
Bottlecap, locked in the attic. Describe a bijection between the set of all ways of distributing the 13 
coal pieces to the three children and the set of 15­bit sequences with exactly 2 ones. 
Solution.  Map a distribution in which Lucy gets l pieces, Spud gets s pieces, and Bottlecap gets b 
� 
pieces to a 15­bit sequence with l zeros, a one, s zeros, a one, and b zeros. 

(e)  On  reﬂection,  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Grumperson  decide  that  each  of  their  three  children  should 
receive at least two pieces of coal for Christmas. Describe a bijection between the set of all ways of 
distributing the 13 coal pieces to the three Grumperson children given this constraint and the set 
of 9­bit sequences with exactly 2 ones. 
Solution.  Map a distribution in which Lucy gets l ≥ 2  pieces, Spud gets s ≥ 2  pieces, and Bottle­
cap gets b ≥ 2 pieces to a 9­bit sequence with exactly l − 2 zeros, a one, s − 2 zeros, a one, and b − 2 
� 
zeros. 

(f)  Describe a bijection between  the  set of 110­bit  sequences with  exactly 10 ones and  solutions 
over the natural numbers to the equation: 

x1  +  x2  +

· · ·
+  x10  ≤  100
Solution.  Let x1  be the number of zeros before the ﬁrst 1, x2 , be the number of zeros between the 
ﬁrst  and  second  1,  etc.  Note  that  zeros  after  the  tenth  1 do  not  contribute  to  the  value  of  any  of 
the variables x1 , . . . , x10 ; this allows us to count solutions to the inequality (≤ 100) rather than the 
� 
equality (=   100). 

(g)  Describe  a  bijection  between  solutions  to  the  inequality  in  the  preceding  problem  part  and 
sequences (y1 , y2 , . . . , y10 ) such that: 
0  ≤ y1  ≤ y2  ≤  · · · ≤ y10  ≤ 100

Solution.  Let yi  =  x1  +

Problem 4.  A numbered tree is a tree whose vertex set is {1, 2, . . . , n} for some n ≥ 2. We deﬁne the 
code of the numbered tree to be a sequence of n − 2  integers from 1 to n obtained by the following 
recursive process: 

If n = 2, stop—the code is the empty sequence. Otherwise, write down the father of 
the largest leaf1 , delete this leaf, and continue the process on the resulting smaller tree. 

For example, the codes of a couple of numbered trees are shown in the Figure 1. 

Figure 1: 

(a)  Describe a procedure for reconstructing a numbered tree from its code. 
Solution.  The key observation  is  that, given a code of  length n − 2,  the numbers between 1 and 
n  which  do  not  appear  in  the  code must  be  leaves  of  the  tree.  Hence,  the  largest missing number 
is  a  leaf  attached  to  the  ﬁrst  number  of  the  code.  The  rest  of  the  tree  can  now  be  reconstructed 
by  deleting  the  ﬁrst  number  in  the  code,  henceforth  ignoring  the  largest  leaf,  and  proceeding

recursively on  the  rest of  the  code.  (We’re using  the obvious  fact  that what’s  left after deleting a 
leaf from a tree is another tree.) 
More precisely,  the  reconstruction procedure applies  to any ﬁnite  tree whose vertex  set  is  totally 
ordered.  The  procedure  takes  two  parameters:  the  vertex  set,  V  ,  and  a  length  |V  − 2  “code”
|
sequence,  S ,  of  elements  in  V  .  If  l  is  the  largest  element  in  V  which  does  not  appear  in  S ,  and 
f  is  the  ﬁrst  element  of  S ,  then  the  reconstructed  tree  is  obtained  by  adding  edge  (l,  f )  to  the 
tree  reconstructed  by  calling  the  procedure  recursively with  ﬁrst  argument  V  − {l} and  second 
argument  equal  to  the  code  obtained  by  erasing  the  initial  f  from  S .  The  procedure  terminates 
when |V  = 2, returning the edge between the two numbers in V  .
|
To justify the key observation, note that any vertex that gets deleted by the process and was not a 
leaf  to begin with, must have been  the  father of a previously deleted  leaf, which means  it would 
appear in the code.  So the missing integers must have been leaves to begin with or must be one of 
the two undeleted vertices left when the coding process terminates.  But by the end of the process 
the  two  remaining  vertices  are  leaves,  and  if  they weren’t  leaves  to  begin with,  they must  have 
become leaves by having their sons deleted, which means they would not have been missing from 
the code.  So the two vertices remaining at the end must also have been leaves of the original tree. 
� 

(b)  How many numbered trees with n  vertices are there?  Justify your answer assuming the result 
of the previous problem part. 

Solution.  There  are  exactly  as  many  n­vertex  numbered  trees  as  the  number  of  possible  code 
words, that is, the number of length n  − 2  sequences integers between 1 and n.  So there are nn−2 
numbered trees. 
The reason  is  that  the map  from  trees  to codes  is a bijection.  To see  this, note  that  the  tree recon­
struction procedure ﬁnds the only possible tree with that code.  So there can’t be two trees with the 
same  code,  i.e.,  the map  from  a  tree  to  its  code  is  an  injection.  But  since  the  reconstruction  pro­
cedure ﬁnds a  tree  for every possible codeword,  the map  from  trees  to codes  is also a surjection.
