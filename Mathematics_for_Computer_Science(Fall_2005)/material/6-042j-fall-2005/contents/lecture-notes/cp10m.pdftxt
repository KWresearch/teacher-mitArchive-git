Problem 1.  A bipartite graph is regular if every vertex on the left has the same degree, c, and every 
vertex on the right has the same degree, d. 

(a)  Prove the following: 
Corollary.  A regular bipartite graph has a matching for the vertices on the left iff c   ≥ d >  0. 

Hint:  Consider  the set of edges between any set, L, on  the  left and  its set of neighbors, N (L), on 
the right. 

(b)  Conclude that the Magician could pull off the Card Trick with a deck of 124 cards. 

Problem  2.  We  have  just  demonstrated  how  to  determine  the  5th  card  in  a  poker  hand when  a 
collaborator reveals the other 4 cards.  Describe a similar method for determining 2 hidden cards 
in a hand of 9 cards when your collaborator reveals the other 7 cards.

Problem 3.  The Tao of BOOKKEEPER: we seek enlightenment through contemplation of the word 
BOOKKEEP ER. 

(a)  In how many ways can you arrange the letters in the word P OKE ? 

(b)  In how many ways can you arrange the letters in the word BO1O2K ?  Observe that we have 
subscripted the O’s to make them distinct symbols. 

(c)  Suppose  we  map  arrangements  of  the  letters  in  BO1O2K  to  arrangements  of  the  letters  in 
BOOK  by  erasing  the  subscripts.  Indicate  with  arrows  how  the  arrangements  on  the  left  are 
mapped to the arrangements on the right.

(d)  What kind of mapping is this, young grasshopper? 

(e)  In light of the Division Rule, how many arrangements are there of BOOK ? 

(f)  Very good, young master! How many arrangements are there of the letters in KE1E2P E3R? 

(g)  Suppose we map each arrangement of KE1E2P E3R to an arrangement of KEEP ER by eras­
ing subscripts.  List all the different arrangements of KE1E2P E3R  that are mapped to REP EEK 
in this way. 

(h)  What kind of mapping is this? 

(i)  So how many arrangements are there of the letters in KEEP ER? 

(j)  Now you are ready to face the BOOKKEEPER! 
How many arrangements of BO1O2K1K2E1E2P E3R  are there? 

(k)  How many arrangements of BOOK1K2E1E2P E3R  are there? 

(l)  How many arrangements of BOOKKE1E2P E3R  are there? 

(m)  How many arrangements of BOOKKEEP ER  are there? 

(n)  How many arrangements of V OODOODOLL are there? 
(o)  (IMPORTANT)  How many n­bit sequences contain k  zeros and (n  − k) ones? 

Remember well what you have learned:  subscripts on, subscripts off. 
This is the Tao of Bookkeeper.

Problem 4.  Solve the following counting problems.  Deﬁne an appropriate mapping (bijective or 
k­to­1) between a set whose size you know and the set in question. 

(a)  How many different ways are there to select a dozen donuts if four varieties are available? 

(b)  How many  paths  are  there  from  (0, 0)  to  (10, 20)  consisting  of  right­steps  (which  increment 
the ﬁrst coordinate) and up­steps (which increment the second coordinate)? 

(c)  An independent living group is hosting nine new candidates for membership. Each candidate 
must be assigned a task:  1 must wash pots, 2 must clean the kitchen, 3 must clean the bathrooms, 
1 must clean the common area, and 2 must serve dinner.  In how many ways this be done? 

(d)  In  how many ways  can Mr.  and Mrs.  Grumperson  distribute  13  identical  pieces  of  coal  to 
their two— no, three!— children for Christmas? 

(e)  How many solutions over the natural numbers are there to the equation: 

x1  +  x2  +  . . . +  x10  ≤  100 

(f)  (Quiz 2, Fall ’03) Suppose that two identical 52­card decks are mixed together.  In how many 
ways can the cards in this double­size deck be arranged?
