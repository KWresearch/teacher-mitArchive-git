Problem 1.  There is a bug on the edge of a 1­meter rug. The bug wants to cross to the other side of 
the rug.  It crawls at 1 cm per second. However, at the end of each second, a malicious ﬁrst­grader 
named Mildred Anderson  stretches  the  rug  by  1 meter.  Assume  that  her  action  is  instantaneous 
and the rug stretches uniformly. Thus, here’s what happens in the ﬁrst few seconds: 

•	 The bug walks 1 cm in the ﬁrst second, so 99 cm remain ahead. 

•	 Mildred stretches the rug by 1 meter, which doubles its length. So now there are 2 cm behind 
the bug and 198 cm ahead. 

•	 The bug walks another 1 cm in the next second, leaving 3 cm behind and 197 cm ahead. 
•	 Then  Mildred  strikes,  stretching  the  rug  from  2  meters  to  3  meters.  So  there  are  now  3  · 
(3/2) = 4.5 cm behind the bug and 197 · (3/2) = 295.5 cm ahead. 
•	 The bug walks another 1 cm in the third second, and so on. 

Your job is to determine this poor bug’s fate. 

(a)  During second i, what fraction of the rug does the bug cross? 

Solution.  During second i,  the  length of  the rug  is 100i cm and  the bug crosses 1 cm.  Therefore, 
� 
the fraction that the bug crosses is 1/100i. 

(b)  Over the ﬁrst n seconds, what fraction of the rug does the bug cross altogether? Express your 
answer in terms of the Harmonic number Hn . 
Solution.  The bug  crosses  1/100 of  the  rug  in  the ﬁrst  second,  1/200  in  the  second,  1/300  in  the 
n�  1  = Hn/100
third, and so forth. Thus, over the ﬁrst n seconds, the fraction crossed by the bug is: 
100k 
k=1 
(This formula is valid only until the bug reaches the far side of the rug.)

(c)  Approximately how many seconds does the bug need to cross the entire rug? 

Solution.  The bug  arrives  at  the  far  side when  the  fraction  it has  crossed  reaches  1.  This occurs 
when n, the number of seconds elapsed, is sufﬁciently large that Hn/100 ≥ 1. Now Hn  is approx­
imately ln n, so the bug arrives about when: 
ln n 
≥ 1 
100 
ln n ≥ 100 
n ≥ e  ≈ 1043  seconds

Problem 2.  Using the method described in lecture, a truck can travel across any size desert if there 
is  a  large  enough  supply  of  gas  at  the  border  of  the  desert.  Show  that  if  there  is  a  large  enough 
supply of gas at the border, a truck can also make a round trip across any size desert. 

Solution.  Given that it can make a one­way trip across any desert, it can make a two­way trip by 
executing the one­way strategy for twice the desert width, but turning around when it gets to the 
desert edge instead of continuing. 
A considerably more efﬁcient approach uses ideas similar to the one­way crossing strategy:  let Rn 
be the distance a truck can travel into the desert and return on n tanks of gas. Clearly, R1  = 1/2. 
On  n + 1  tanks,  the  strategy  is  to  have  truck  travel  distance  x and  back  n times,  leaving  1 − 2x 
tanks of gas at distance x into the desert on each trip.  It then makes one more one­way trip to x. 
This leaves it with n(1 − 2x) + 1 − x tanks of gas at position x.  Leaving an xth of a tank so it can 
get back, if the remaining (n(1 − 2x) + 1 − x) − x =  (n + 1)(1 − 2x) tanks equal n, it can execute 
the n­tank round trip strategy from position x and still return to the desert border.  So, letting 
(n + 1)(1 − 2x) =  n 
x  = 1/2(n + 1) 
Rn+1  =  Rn  + x = Rn  + 1/2(n + 1).

Therefore, 

Rn  = 1/2(1 + 1/2 + 1/

Problem  3.  There  is  a  number  a such  that  ∞
i=1 
Prove it. 

ip  converges  iff  p < a.  What  is  the  value  of  a?

Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 8, Fri. 
Solution.  a = −1. 
For p =  −1,  the sum  is the harmonic series which we know does not converge.  Since the term i
p
is increasing in p for i > 1, the sum will be larger, and hence also diverge for p > −1. 
By the integral method, the sum is Θ of the integral from 1 to ∞ of xp .  For p < −1, the indeﬁnite 
integral is xp+1/(p + 1) = Θ(1/x� ) for � = −1 − p > 0, so the integral evaluates to a constant. Hence 
� 
the sum is bounded above, and since it is increasing, it has a ﬁnite limit, i.e., it converges.
