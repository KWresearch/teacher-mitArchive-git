Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 2, Fri. 


Problem  1.  Subset  take­away1  is  a  two  player  game  involving  a  ﬁxed  ﬁnite  set,  A.  Players  al­
ternately  choose proper,  nonempty  subsets of A  with  the  condition  that one may not name a  set 
containing a set that was named earlier. A  player who is unable to move loses. 
For example,  if A  is {1},  then there are no legal moves and the second player wins.  If A  is {1,  2}, 
then the only legal moves are {1} and {2}. Each is a good reply to the other, and so once again the 
second player wins. 
The ﬁrst interesting case is when A  has three elements.  This time, if the ﬁrst player picks a subset 
with  one  element,  the  second  player  picks  the  subset  with  the  other  two  elements.  If  the  ﬁrst 
player picks a  subset with  two elements,  the  second player picks  the  subset whose  sole member 
is the third element.  Both cases produce positions equivalent to the starting position when A  has 
two elements, and thus leads to a win for the second player. 
Verify that when A  has four elements, the second player still has a winning strategy.2 

Solution.  Case  1:[1st  player  chooses  a  size  1  subset]  Then  2nd  player  should  choose  the  size  3 
subset consisting of the other 3 elements. This results in a position corresponding to a size 3 game, 
and is therefore a win for the 2nd player. 
Case  2:[1st player  chooses  a  size  3  subset] Then  2nd player  should  choose  the  size  1  subset  con­
taining  the  remaining  element.  This  results  in  a  position  corresponding  to  a  size  3  game,  and  is 
therefore a win for the 2nd player. 
Case 3:[1st player chooses a size 2 subset {a,  b}] Then 2nd player should choose the complemen­
tary  size  2  subset  {c,  d}.  Here  a,  b,  c,  d  are  the  numbers  1,2,3,4  in  some  order.  So  the  possible 
remaining moves are the four other subsets of size 2 and the four subsets of size 1. 
Subcase 3.1:  At some point in further play, Player 1 picks a size 2 subset, {a,  c}.  Then 
its complement,  {b,  d}, will also be available as a possible move,  and Player 2  should 
choose the complement. This leaves a situation in which one of the Subcases 3.1–3 will 
again apply. 
Subcase 3.2: At some point in further play, Player 1 picks a size 1 subset, {x}, and this 
leaves a size 2 subset available as a legal move. Then a size 2 subset, {x,  y}, must have

2David Gale worked out some of the properties of this game and conjectured that the second player wins the game 
for any set A. This remains an open problem.

been  chosen  previously,  and  the  size  1  set  {y}  will  be  available  as  a  possible  move. 
Player 2 should choose {y}. This leaves a situation that is the same as the game on the 
complement of {x, y}, which Player 2 can win. 
Subcase 3.3: At some point in further play, Player 1 picks a size 1 subset and no size 2 
subset remains as a legal move.  Then some other size 1 subset will also available as a 
possible move,  and Player 2  should  choose any  such  size 1  subset.  This either  leaves 
no more moves, or the situation of a game of size 2, which Player 2 will win  in either 
case. 

We  leave  it  to  the  reader  to check  that  the moves prescribed  in  the  subcases 3.1–3 will  indeed be 
possible. Granting this, it follows that these subcases exhaust the possible plays, which shows that 
� 
Player 2 wins in any of the subcases. Hence Player 2 has a winning strategy in all cases. 

Solution.  One such bijection is

if n is even,
if n is odd.

(b)  Deﬁne a bijection between N and N × N (the ordered pairs (0,0),(0,1),(1,2),. . . of natural num­
bers). 

Solution.  Let Lk  be the  list of pairs whose sum is k in the  increasing order of ﬁrst coordinate, so 
Lk  = (0, k), (1, k − 1), (2, k − 2), . . . , (k , 0).  Then form the inﬁnite list consisting of the elements of 
L0  then the elements of L1 , then the elements of L2 , . . . : 

(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, 2)(1, 1)(2, 0), (0, 3) . . . 
Deﬁne f (n) to be the n − 1st pair in the list (so f (0)  = (0, 0)).
