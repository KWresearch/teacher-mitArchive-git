Gamblers Ruin 

A  gambler  aims  to  gamble  until  he  reaches  a  goal  of  T  dollars  or  until  he  runs  out  of 
money,  in which  case he  is  said  to  be  “ruined.”  He  gambles  by making  a  sequence  of  1 
dollar bets.  If he wins an individual bet, his stake increases by one dollar.  If he loses, his 
stake decreases by one dollar.  In each bet, he wins with probability p >  0  and loses with 
probability q  ::=  1   − p >  0.  He is an overall winner if he reaches his goal and is an overall 
loser if he gets ruined. 
In a fair game, p  =  q  = 1/2.  The gambler is more likely to win if p >  1/2  and less likely to 
win if p <  1/2. 
With  T  and  p  ﬁxed,  the  gambler ’s  probability  of  winning  will  depend  on  how  much 
money he starts with.  Let wn  be the probability that he is a winner when his initial stake 
in n  dollars. 

Problem 1.  (a)  What are w0  and wT ?

Solution.  w0  = 0   and wT  = 1.

(1) 
wn+1  =  awn  +  bwn−1 
for some constants a,  b  and 0  < n  <  T . Write simple expressions for a  and b  in terms of p. 
Solution.  By Total Probability 
wn  =  Pr {win game  |  win the ﬁrst bet} Pr {win the ﬁrst bet} + 
Pr {win game  |  lose the ﬁrst bet} Pr {lose the ﬁrst bet}

Solution.  Given (4), we want c,   d  such that

Hint: Use equation (4) again.

Solution.  This time p  =  q  =  1/2 so from (4),


Now we need a,   b  such that 

so we will have 

g(x) = 

w1x

(1 − x)2  , 

wn  =  a  + b(n  + 1). 

Solving for a,   b, we have from (10) 

w1x  =  a(1 − x) + b. 
Letting x   =  0 yields a  =  −b  and x  =  1 yields b   =  w1 , so 
wn  =  −w1  + w1 (n  + 1) =  w1n. 

Also,

Problem  3.  Now  suppose T  =  ∞,  that  is,  the gambler keeps playing until he  is  ruined. 
(Now  there  may  be  a  positive  probability  that  he  actually  plays  forever.)  Let  r  be  the 
probability  that  starting  with  n  >  0 dollars,  the  gambler ’s  stake  ever  gets  reduced  to 
n  − 1
.

(a)  Explain why 

2 
r  = q + pr  . 

Solution.  By Total Probability 
r  = Pr {ever down $1 
lose the ﬁrst bet} Pr {lose the ﬁrst bet} +
|
Pr {ever down $1  win the ﬁrst bet} Pr {win the ﬁrst bet}
| 
= q + p Pr {ever down $1  win the ﬁrst bet}
| 

But 

Pr {ever down $1  win the ﬁrst bet}
| 
= Pr {ever down $2} 
= Pr {being down the ﬁrst $1} Pr {being down another $1}
2 = r .  

� 

(b)  Conclude that if p  ≤ 1/2, then r  = 1. 
Solution.  pr2  − r  + q  has roots q/p  and 1.  So r  =  1 or r  =  q/p.  But 1 ≤  r , which  implies 
r  = 1 when q/p   ≥ 1, that is, when p  ≤ 1/2. 
In  fact  r  =  q/p  when  q/p  <  1,  namely,  when  p  >  1/2,  but  this  requires  an  additional 
� 
argument that we omit. 

(c)  Conclude  that  even  in  a  fair  game,  the  gambler  is  sure  to  get  ruined  no  matter  how 
much money he starts with! 

Solution.  The gambler gets ruined starting with initial stake n  =  1 precisely if his initial 
stake goes down by 1 dollar, so his probability of ruin is r , which equals 1 in the fair case. 
The recurrence (1) will also hold  in this T  =  ∞ case  if we  interpret wn  as the probability 
of not being ruined, that is, the gambler wins if he can gamble forever.  So w1  is the prob­
ability he is not getting ruined starting with a 1 dollar stake, that is w1  = 1 − r  = 0.  Since 
w0  = 0 = w1 , the recurrence implies that wn  = 0 for all n  ≥ 0.

(d)  Let t  be the expected time for the gambler ’s stake to go down by 1 dollar. Verify that 

t  =  q  + p(1 + 2t).


Conclude that starting with a 1 dollar stake in a fair game, the gambler can expect to play 
forever! 

Solution.  By Total Expectation 

|
lose the ﬁrst bet] Pr {lose the ﬁrst bet} +
t  =  E [#steps to be down $1 
E [#steps to be down $1  win the ﬁrst bet] Pr {win the ﬁrst bet}
| 
=  q  + p E [1 + #steps to be down $1  | win the ﬁrst bet] . 

But 

E [#steps to be down $1  | win the ﬁrst bet] 
=  E [#steps to be down $2] 
=  E [#steps to be down the ﬁrst $1] + E [#steps to be down another $1]  
=  2t. 

This implies the required formula t  =  q  + p(1 + 2t).  If p  =  1/2 we conclude that t  =  1 + t, 
� 
which means t   must be inﬁnite.
