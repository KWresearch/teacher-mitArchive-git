Problem  1.  A  prison  warden  has  two  holding  cells,  Cell  1  and  Cell  2,  for  his  prison­
ers. Unfortunately, many pairs of these prisoners are incompatible, and there will be some 
trouble  if an  incompatible pair are  in  the same cell.  The warden would  like  to minimize 
trouble  by  not  having  too many  incompatible  pairs  in  the  same  cell.  Unfortunately,  the 
warden has no idea how to split the up prisoners, and so he decides to go with a random 
assignment:  he will assign prisoners to one cell or the other by successive (independent) 
ﬂips of a fair coin. 
For any two incompatible prisoners, a,  b, let Ta,b  be 1  if a  and b  are placed in the same cell, 
and 0  otherwise. 

(a)  What is the expected value of Ta,b? 
Solution.  1/2 

� 

Suppose there are n  incompatible sets of prisoners, a,  b. The total trouble, T , of an assign­
ment of prisoners to cells is the sum of Ta,b  where the sum is over the n  sets of incompatible 
prisoners a  =�
b.  So T  is the total number of incompatible sets of two prisoners that are in 
the same cell. The warden hopes to minimize the total trouble, T . 

(b)  What is the expected value of T ? 
Solution.  E [T ] =  n  E [Ta,b ] =  n/2. 

� 

(c)  Explain  why  there  must  be  a  split  of  the  prisoners  between  cells  that  separates  at 
least half the incompatible pairs. 
Solution.  There must be a way of splitting up the prisoners so that the total trouble is at 
most the expected trouble for a random split.  That is, there is an assignment of prisoners 
to cells that causes no more trouble than the average n/2. 
This  is  a  probabilistic  proof  of  the  existence  of  a  pretty  good  (no worse  than  average)  as­
signment  to  cells.  We  used  a  similar  argument  to  prove  there was  a  satisfying  truth  as­
� 
signment for some Boolean formulas in a previous class problem.

(d)  Suppose  a,  b,  c  are  different  prisoners,  where  a  and  b  are  incompatible,  and  a  and  c 
are also incompatible. Explain why Ta,b  is independent of Ta,c . Conclude that set of all the 
Ta,b ’s is pairwise independent. 
Solution.  For incompatible prisoners a,  b  and i,  j  ∈ {1,  2}, let S (a,  b,  i) be the event that a 
and b  are both in cell i. 
Pr {Ta,b  =  1  and Ta,c  =  1} 
=  Pr {S (a,  b,  1)  ∩ S (a,  c,  1)} +  Pr {S (a,  b,  2)  ∩ S (a,  c,  2)} 
=  Pr {a,  b,  c  in cell 1} +  Pr {a,   b,  c  in cell 2} 
=  (1/2)3  +  (1/2)3 
=  (1/2)  · (1/2) 
=  Pr {Ta,b  =  1} · Pr {Ta,c  =  1} , 

(Pr {disjoint events}) 

(the cells of a,   b,   c  are independent) 

which proves that [Ta,b  = 1]   and [Ta,c  = 1]  are independent events. But indicator variables 
are independent iff the events they indicate are independent, so the random variables Ta,b 
and Ta,c  are independent. 
Also,  it’s obvious  that Ta,b  and Tc,d  are  independent  if a,  b  and  c,  d  don’t overlap.  So any 
� 
two Ta,b ’s are independent. 

(e)  Are the Ta,b ’s mutually independent? 

Solution.  No:  if a,  b   are in opposite cells and b,  c  are in opposite cells, then a,  c  are in the 
� 
same cell. 

(f)  What is the variance of T ? 
Solution.  The variance of Ta,b  is 1/2  − 1/4  = 1/4  since it is a Bernoulli variable with bias 
� 
1/2.  Since the Ta,b ’s are pairwise independent, the variance of T  is 
a,b  incompatible 

1/4 =  n/4. 

� 

(g)  Suppose among 1000 prisoners, about a ﬁfth of the pairs, say 100,000 pairs, turn out 
to  be  incompatible.  Show  that  there  is  at most  a  10%  chance  that  the warden’s  random 
assignment differs by more  than 1%  from  the expected number of  incompatible pairs  in 
the same cell. Hint: Chebyshev.

Solution.  Letting µ  =  E [T ], Chebyshev says 
>  �µ} ≤ 
Pr {|T  − µ| 

Var [T ]
(�µ)2 

For �µ  to be 1% of µ we have �  = 0.01. Using the facts that µ  =  50,  000 and Var [T ]  = 25,  000, 
we  conclude  that  the probability  that  the  total  trouble differs by more  than 1%  from  the 
expected 50,000 incompatible pairs is at most 

Var [T ]

. 

So  there  is  at most  a  10%  chance  the warden’s  split will  cause  1% more  (or  less)  trouble 
� 
than expected. 

Problem 2.  Now we look at the situation in the previous problem in more detail. Suppose 
there are levels of conﬂict between incompatible prisoners, where the conﬂict level of two 
prisoners who may hate each other ’s guts is 1 if they wouldn’t actually touch each other, 
2  if  they might hurt each other but wouldn’t cause a  trip  to  the hospital, and 3  if having 
them  in  the same cell would be really bad.  Suppose we model  the situation by assuming 
that a  random  conﬂict  level wa,b  equal  to 1,2,  or 3  is assigned  to every  two  incompatible 
prisoners, a,  b, uniformly and independently of all other conﬂict levels. 
� 
So  Ta,bwa,b  is  0  if  a,  b   are  placed  in  different  cells  and  is  wa,b  otherwise.  Deﬁne  the  total 
conﬂict to be 
Ta,bwa,b , 
a,b  incompatible 
that is, the sum of the levels of conﬂicting pairs in which the members are assigned to the 
same cell. We would like the total conﬂict to be small. 

C  ::= 

(a)  What is the expected value of wa,b  and Ta,bwa.b? 

Solution. 

E [wa,b ] = 1/3  +  2/3  +  3/3  = 2. 
Also, since wa,b  and Ta,b  are obviously independent, 

E [Ta,bwa,b ] =  E [Ta,b ] E [wa,b ] = (1/2)2  = 1. 

� 

(b)  What is the variance of wa,b  and Ta,bwa,b? 

Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 14, Fri. 
Solution.  Var [wa,b ]  = (12  +  22  +  32 )/3  − 22  = 2/3, and Var [Ta,bwa,b ]  = 4/3  similarly. 

(c)  What is the expected value of C ? 

Solution.  n  E [Ta,bwa,b ] =  n. 

(d)  Are the Ta,bwa,b ’s pairwise independent?  . . . mutually independent? 

Solution.  Yes. No. As in the previous problem.

(e)  What is the variance of C ? 

Solution.  Since the Ta,bwa.b ’s are pairwise independent, the variance of C  is n  Var [Ta,bwa.b ] =  
� 
4n/3. 

(f)  What does Chebyshev’s inequality give for a bound on Pr {|C  − E [C ]|} > n/4? 
Solution.  64/3n. 

� 

(g)  Suppose someone complains about our modeling the situation as choosing a random 
conﬂict  level  of  1,2,  or  3,  and  agrees  only  that  conﬂict  levels  range  between  1  and  3.  So 
then the w’s for different incompatible pairs may have different distributions, but we still 
assume  they  are  independent.  Could  we  still  use  Chebyshev’s  inequality  to  say  some­
thing  about  the  probability  of  deviating  from  the mean?  Hint:  :  What  is  the maximum 
possible variance for a random variable with values between 0 and 3? 
� 
� 
|
Solution.  Since 0   ≤ Ta,bwa,b  ≤ 3, it follows that  E [Ta,bwa,b ] − Ta,bwa,b ≤ 3  and so 
| 
Var [Ta,bwa,b ] =  E  (Ta,bwa,b  − Ta,bwa,b )2  ≤ 9. 
The variance of C  is then at most 9n.  Then Pr {|C  − E [C ] > n/4} is at most 9n/(n/4)2  =
|
� 
144/n.  So as long as n  >  144, we can say something nontrivial. 

Problem  3.  A  recent  Gallup  poll  found  that  35%  of  the  adult  population  of  the  United 
States believes  that  the  theory of evolution  is “well­supported by  the evidence”.  Gallup 
polled 1928 people and claims a margin of error of 3 percentage points. 

Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 14, Fri.

Let’s  check Gallup’s  claim.  Suppose  that  there are m  adult Americans,  of whom pm  be­
lieve in evolution; this means that (1 − p)m  Americans do not believe in evolution. Gallup 
polls 1928  Americans selected uniformly and independently at random. Of these, 675  be­
lieve in evolution, leading to Gallup’s estimate that the fraction of Americans who believe 
in evolution is within 0.03 of 675/1928  ≈ 0.350. 

(a)  Explain how  to use  the Binomial Sampling Theorem  (available  in  the Appendix)  to 
determine the conﬁdence level with which Gallup can make his claim. You do not actually 
have to do the calculation, but are welcome to if you have the means. 

Solution.  We  let  �  = 0.03  and  n  =  1928  in  the  expression  on  the  righthand  side  of 
equation  (1)  in  the  Binomial  Sampling  Theorem.  Evaluating  the  expression  in  Scheme 
(see  Appendix),  we  see  that  the  probability  that  the  error  is  0.03  or  more  is  less  than 
0.009983  <  0.01, which means that 99% of the time1  the fraction p  will lie within the spec­
iﬁed range 0.35   ± 0.03. 
� 

(b)  If we accept all of Gallup’s polling data and calculations, can we conclude that there 
is a high probability that the number of adult Americans who believe in evolution is 35± 3 
percent? 

Solution.  No.  As  explained  in  Notes  and  a  class  problem  last  week,  the  assertion  that 
fraction p  is in the range 0.35   ± 0.03  is an assertion of fact that is either true or false.  The 
number p  is an constant whose value we don’t know, so we don’t know if the asserted fact 
is true or false, but there is nothing probabilistic about its truth or falsehood. 
We  can  say  that  either  the  assertion  is  true  or  else  a  1­in­100  event  occurred  during  the 
poll.  Speciﬁcally,  the  unlikely  event  is  that Gallup’s  random  sample was  unrepresenta­
tive. This may convince you that p  is “probably” in the range 0.35  ± 0.03, but this informal 
� 
“probably” is not a mathematical probability. 

(c)  Explaining Sampling to a Jury The calculation above revealed that, based on a poll 
of  1928  people,  we  can  be  highly  conﬁdent  that  the  per  cent  of  people  in  the  U.S.  who 
believe  in  evolution  is  35%  ± 3%.  Note  that  the  actual population of  the U.S. was never 
considered, because it did not matter! 
Suppose you were going to serve as an expert witness in a trial. How would you explain 
to a jury why the number of people necessary to poll does not depend on the population size? 
(Begin  by  explaining  why  it  is  reasonable  to model  polling  as  independent  coin  tosses. 
Remember  that  juries do not understand  algebra or  equations;  you might be ok using  a 
little arithmetic.) 

1An  exact  calculation  shows  that  the  99%  conﬁdence  level  could  have  been  achieved  by  polling  only 
n  =  1863 people. With 1928 people, the estimate actually holds at the 99.17%   level.

Solution.  This  was  intended  to  be  a  thought­provoking,  conceptual  question.  In  past 
terms, although most of the class could crank through the formulas for poll size and con­
ﬁdence  levels,  they couldn’t articulate,  and  indeed didn’t  really believe  that  the derived 
sample sizes were actually adequate to produce reliable estimates. 
Here’s a way to explain why we model polling people about evolution (or anything else) 
as independent coin tosses that a jury might be able to follow: 

Of  the  approximately  250,000,000  people  in  the  US,  there  are  some  unknown 
number,  say  87,000,000,  who  believe  evolution  is  well­supported.  So  in  this 
case, the fraction of people believing in evolution would be 

87,  000,  000/250,  000,  000  = 0.35. 

To  estimate  this  unknown  fraction,  we  randomly  select  one  person  from  the 
250,000,000 in such a way that everyone has an equal chance of being picked. For ex­
ample, we might get computer ﬁles from the Census Bureau listing all 250,000,000 
people in the US. Then we would generate a number between 1 and 250,000,000 
by  some  physical  or  computational  process  that  generated  each  number  with 
equal probability, and then we would interview the person whose number came 
up.  In  this way, we can be sure  that  the probability  that a person we select be­
lieves in evolution is exactly the unknown fraction who believe in evolution. 
After we have picked a person and learned their beliefs, we perform the proce­
dure again, making sure that everyone is equally likely to be picked the second 
time, and so on, for picking a third, fourth, etc. person.  On each pick the prob­
ability  of  getting  a  person  who  believes  in  evolution  is  the  same  fraction,  so 
we describe picking a person in this way as “ﬂipping a coin” that has this frac­
tion  as  probability  of  coming  up  “Heads”—meaning  that  the  person  selected 
believes in evolution. 
Now we all understand that if we keep ﬂipping a coin with a certain probability 
of  coming  up  Heads,  then  the  more  we  ﬂip,  the  closer  the  fraction  of  Heads 
ﬂipped will be to that probability. Mathematical theory lets us calculate us how 
many  time  to  ﬂip  coins  to make  the  fraction  of Heads  very  likely  close  to  the 
right fraction, but we won’t go into those details. 
It’s also clear, that if two different coins have the same probability of coming up 
Heads, it makes no difference in our experiments which coin we use:  the num­
ber of ﬂips we need for the fraction of Heads ﬂipped to be very likely to be close 
to the probability of a Head will be the same for either coin. So whether the coin 
had probability of heads, say, 0.35, because 87,000,000 out of 250,000,000 people 
believe  in evolution,  or 700 out of 2000,  or 35 out of 100—the  same number of 
ﬂips will  allow  us  to  estimate  the  probability  of Heads,  and  hence  to  estimate 
the fraction of the population believing in evolution.  So the number of people we 
need  to  poll  is  the  same,  whether  we  are  selecting  from  a  large  population  or  a 
small  population,  as  long  as  the  fraction  believing  in  evolution  is  the  same  in 
the small population as in the large one.
