In­Class Problems Week 2, Fri. 

Problem  1.  Subset  take­away1  is  a  two  player  game  involving  a  ﬁxed  ﬁnite  set,  A.  Players  al­
ternately  choose proper,  nonempty  subsets of A  with  the  condition  that one may not name a  set 
containing a set that was named earlier. A  player who is unable to move loses. 
For example,  if A  is {1},  then there are no legal moves and the second player wins.  If A  is {1,  2}, 
then the only legal moves are {1} and {2}. Each is a good reply to the other, and so once again the 
second player wins. 
The ﬁrst interesting case is when A  has three elements.  This time, if the ﬁrst player picks a subset 
with  one  element,  the  second  player  picks  the  subset  with  the  other  two  elements.  If  the  ﬁrst 
player picks a  subset with  two elements,  the  second player picks  the  subset whose  sole member 
is the third element.  Both cases produce positions equivalent to the starting position when A  has 
two elements, and thus leads to a win for the second player. 
Verify that when A  has four elements, the second player still has a winning strategy.2 

Problem 2.  (a)  Deﬁne a bijection between N and Z. 
(b)  Deﬁne a bijection between N and N × N (the ordered pairs (0,0),(0,1),(1,2),. . . of natural num­
bers).

2David Gale worked out some of the propeeties of this game and made conjectured that the second player wins the 
game for any set A. This remains an open problem.
