Sum for Children 

Nine-year old Gauss saw 
30 numbers each 13 greater 

than the previous one.

(So the story goes.)

Sum for Children 
1st  + 30th  = 89+466 
2nd + 29th  = 
(1st+13) + (30th−13) 
3rd + 28th = 
(2nd+13) + (29th−13) 

= 555 

= 555 

= 555 

Sum for Children 
Sum of kth  term and (31−k)th  term 
is invariant! 
Total = 555 ⋅ 15 
= (1st  + last) ⋅ (# terms/2) 
= ((1st +last)/2) ⋅ (# terms)

The future value of $$ 

I will promise to pay you $100 
in exactly one year, 
if you will pay me $X now. 

The future value of $$ 
My bank will pay me 3% interest. 
Define bankrate: 
b ::= 1.03 
-- the factor by which bank will 
increase my holdings in 1 year.

The future value of $$ 
If I deposit your $X for a year, 

I will have $(b⋅X).

So I won’t lose money as long as

bX ≥ 100.

X  ≥ $100/1.03 ≈ $97.09


The future value of $$ 
• $1 in a year is worth $ 0.9709 today 
• $n is worth $nr a year earlier, 
where r ::= 1/b. 
• So $n paid in two years is worth 
$nr paid in one year, and is worth 
$nr2  today.
