Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 4, Mon. 

Problem 1.  In each case, say whether or not R is a equivalence relation on A.  If it is an equivalence 
relation, what are the equivalence classes and how many equivalence classes are there? 

(a)  R  ::=  {(x,  y) ∈ W  × W 
|
the words x  and y  start with the same letter} where W  is  the  set  of 
all words in the 2001 edition of the Oxford English dictionary. 

Solution.  R  is an equivalence relation since it is reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive.  The equiva­
lence class of x  with respect to R  is the set [x]R  =  the set of words y , such that y  has the same ﬁrst 
� 
letter as x. There are 26 equivalence classes, one for each letter of the English alphabet. 

(b)  R ::=  {(x,  y) ∈ W  × W 

| 

the words x  and y  have at least one letter in common}.

Solution.  S  is reﬂexive and symmetric, but it is not transitive.  Therefore, S  is not an equivalence 
relation.  For  example,  let w1  be  the word  “scream,”  let w2  be  the word  “and,”  and  let w3  be  the 
� 
word “shout.” Then w3Sw1 , and w1Sw2 , but it is not the case that w3Sw2 . 

(c)  R  =  {(x, y) ∈ W  × W  and the word x  comes before the word y  alphabetically}. 

Solution.  R is not reﬂexive but it is transitive and antisymmetric.  It is not an equivalence relation, 
� 
but it is a partial order. 

(d)  R  =  {(x, y) ∈ R × R and  x|
| ≤ |y |}. 

Solution.  R  is  reﬂexive  and  transitive.  It  is  not  symmetric.  It  is  not  antisymmetric  either.  As  a 
counterexample, | − 3| ≤ | | | | ≤ | − 3|
, but 3 =  −3.

Solution.  R  is reﬂexive, symmetric and transitive, and therefore an equivalence relation. There is 
an equivalence class for each natural number corresponding to bit strings with that number of 1s.

Problem 2. 

False Claim.  Suppose R  is a relation on A.  If R  is symmetric and transitive, then R  is reﬂexive. 

(a)  Give a counter­example to the claim. 

Solution.  The simplest counterexample is to let R  be the empty relation on some nonempty set A. 
This R  is vacuously symmetric and transitive, but obviously not reﬂexive. 
A slightly less trivial example is 

R  ::=  {(a,   a),  (a,  b),  (b,  a),  (b,  b)} 
on the set A  ::=  {a,  b,  c}.  It is not reﬂexive because (c,  c) is not in R. 

� 

(b)  Find the ﬂaw in the following proof of the claim: 

False proof.  Let x  be an arbitrary element of A.  Let y  be any element of A  such  that xRy .  Since R 
is symmetric, it follows that yRx.  Then since xRy  and yRx, we conclude by transitivity that xRx. 
Since x  was arbitrary, we have shown that ∀x  ∈ A  (xRx), so R  is reﬂexive. 
Solution.  The ﬂaw is assuming that y  exists.  It is possible that there is an x  ∈ A  that is not related 
by R  to anything. No such R  will be reﬂexive. 
Note that the theorem can be ﬁxed:  R  restricted to its domain of deﬁnition is reﬂexive, and hence 
� 
an equivalence relation. 

Problem 3.  Verify  that each of  the  following relations  is a partial order by describing a  function, 
g , such that the relation is deﬁned by g  according to the Deﬁnition 4.2 in the Appendix.  For each, 
is it a total order? 

(a)  The relation, <, on R. 

Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 4, Mon. 
Solution.  Deﬁne g(r) ::=  {t  ∈ R  t  < r}.  It follows that 
|
iff  g(r1 ) ⊂ g(r2 ) 
r1  < r2 
so  <  satisﬁes  the  condition  (3)  on  R  that  deﬁnes  partial  orders.  Likewise,  the  relation,  ≤,  is  a 
partial order because 
r1  ≤ r2 

iff  r1  < r2 ,

for all reals r1  =  r2 . 

(b)  The superset relation, ⊇, on P (B ) for a set, B . 
Solution.  Deﬁne g(a) ::=   a  ::=  B  − {a}, and note that for a1  =� a2  ∈ P (B ), 
iff  a1  ⊃ a2 
�=  a2 ) 
a1  ⊇ a2 
(since a1 
iff  a1  ⊂ a2 
(basic set theory) 
iff  g(a1 ) ⊂ g(a2 ) 
(def of g ). 

(c)  The “divides” relation on natural numbers.


Solution.  Let g(a) ::=   the set of natural number that divide a.

Problem  4.  Suppose  you  are  given  the  description  of  an  equivalence  relation  and  want  to  cut 
down on  the number of pairs  that are  stored without  losing any  information.  For example, here 
are the pairs of an equivalence relation on a set of integers: 
G ::=  {11, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 13, 31, 45, 54, 47, 74, 57, 75} . 

where for readability, we’ve written ”mk” to designate the pair (m,  k). 
To start, we know that if we have mk , then we necessarily also have km, so there’s no need to keep 
both. This lets us cut down to: 

{11, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 13, 45, 47, 57} . 
Also, if we have 45 and 57, we don’t need 47, since that will necessarily be there (by transitivity), 
so we can further cut down to 

{11, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 13, 45, 57}

In addition, as long as we keep some pair in which k appears, we don’t need the pair kk . This lets 
us cut down to the pairs 
{66, 13, 45, 57} . 
These pairs are all that are needed to determine the entire original equivalence relation, G. More­
over, the set (1) of these pairs is minimal with this property; this means that if any pair was removed 
from the set, it wouldn’t determine the relation any more. 

(1) 

(a)  Describe another couple of minimal sets of pairs that determine the relation. 

Solution. 

{66, 31, 45, 57} , {66, 13, 47, 57} ,  and lots more . . . .  

� 

(b)  Here  are  the  pairs  that  are  left  after  some  unnecessary  pairs  have  been  removed  from  the 
description  of  an  equivalence  relation,  E .  What  is  the  domain  of  E ?  What  are  the  equivalence 
classes of E ? 

15, 20, 40, 57, 68, 79, 9a, bb, c3 

Solution. 

domain of E =  {0123456789abc}

equivalence classes of E =  {024} {1579a} {3c} {68} {b} .


� 

(c)  On  a  domain  of  n  elements,  what  is  the  smallest  number  of  pairs  that  could  determine  an 
equivalence relation? 
Solution.  �n/2� by having all blocks of size 2, except for one block of size 1 if n is odd. 

� 

(d)  Suppose you have an equivalence relation on a domain of size n with k equivalence classes, 
with no  classes  of  just  one  element.  Then  every minimal  set  of pairs has  the  same  size.  What  is 
that size? Explain. 
Solution.  It takes n − k pairs.  We’ll let you convince yourself that c − 1  is the minimum number 
of pairs to “connect up” all the elements and thereby determine an equivalence class of size c > 1. 
(We’ll  prove  this  carefully  in  couple  of  weeks  when  we  study  tree  structures.)  So  if  there  are  k 
classes of sizes c1 , . . . , ck , you need 
(c1  − 1)  +  (c2  − 1)  +  · · · +  (ck  − 1)  = (c1  +  c2  +

+  ck ) − k =  n − k

Equivalence 

5 

Deﬁnition 4.1.  A binary relation, R, on a set, A,  is an equivalence relation iff there is a function, f , 
with domain A, such that 

a1  R a2 

iff  f (a1 ) =  f (a2 ) 

(2) 

for all a1 ,  a2  ∈ A. 
Theorem.  A relation is an equivalence iff it is reﬂexive, symmetric and transitive. 

Partial Order 

Deﬁnition 4.2.  A relation, R, on a set, A, is a partial order providing there is a function, g , from A 
to some collection of sets such that 

a1  R a2 

iff  g(a1 ) ⊂ g(a2 ), 

(3) 

for all a1  =  a2  ∈ A. 
Theorem.  A relation is a partial order iff it is transitive and antisymmetric. 

Relational Properties 

A binary relation, R, on a set, A, is 
•  reﬂexive if aRa  for every a  ∈ A, 
•  irreﬂexive if aRa   holds for no a  ∈ A, 
•  symmetric if for every a,  b   ∈ A, aRb   implies bRa, 
•  antisymmetric if for every a  =  b  ∈ A, aRb  implies ¬(bRa), 
•  asymmetric if for every a,  b   ∈ A, aRb  implies ¬(bRa), 
•  transitive if for every a,   b,  c  ∈ A, aRb  and bRc  implies aRc.
