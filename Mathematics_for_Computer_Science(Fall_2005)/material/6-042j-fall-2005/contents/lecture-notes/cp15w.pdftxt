Gamblers Ruin 

A  gambler  aims  to  gamble  until  he  reaches  a  goal  of  T  dollars  or  until  he  runs  out  of 
money,  in which  case he  is  said  to  be  “ruined.”  He  gambles  by making  a  sequence  of  1 
dollar bets.  If he wins an individual bet, his stake increases by one dollar.  If he loses, his 
stake decreases by one dollar.  In each bet, he wins with probability p > 0  and loses with 
probability q ::=  1   − p > 0.  He is an overall winner if he reaches his goal and is an overall 
loser if he gets ruined. 
In a fair game, p =  q = 1/2.  The gambler is more likely to win if p > 1/2  and less likely to 
win if p < 1/2. 
With  T  and  p  ﬁxed,  the  gambler ’s  probability  of  winning  will  depend  on  how  much 
money he starts with.  Let wn  be the probability that he is a winner when his initial stake 
in n dollars. 

Problem 1.  (a)  What are w0  and wT ? 

(b)  Note that wn  satisﬁes a linear recurrence 

wn+1  =  awn  +  bwn−1

for some constants a, b and 0  < n < T . Write simple expressions for a and b in terms of p. 
∞  wnxn  be the

(c)  For n  > T , let wn  be deﬁned by the recurrence (1), and let g(x) ::= 
generating function for the sequence w0 , w1 , . . . . Verify that

Problem  3.  Now  suppose T  =  ∞,  that  is,  the gambler keeps playing until he  is  ruined. 
(Now  there  may  be  a  positive  probability  that  he  actually  plays  forever.)  Let  r  be  the 
probability  that  starting  with  n  >  0 dollars,  the  gambler ’s  stake  ever  gets  reduced  to 
n  − 1
.

(a)  Explain why 

2 
r  =  q + pr  . 
(b)  Conclude that if p  ≤ 1/2, then r  =  1. 
(c)  Conclude  that  even  in  a  fair  game,  the  gambler  is  sure  to  get  ruined  no  matter  how 
much money he starts with! 

(d)  Let t  be the expected time for the gambler ’s stake to go down by 1 dollar. Verify that 

t  =  q + p(1 + 2t). 

Conclude that starting with a 1 dollar stake in a fair game, the gambler can expect to play 
forever!
