Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 13, Mon. 

Problem 1.  Suppose that you ﬂip three fair, mutually independent coins.  Deﬁne the fol­
lowing events: 

•  Let A be the event that the ﬁrst coin is heads. 

•  Let B  be the event that the second coin is heads. 

•  Let C  be the event that the third coin is heads. 

•  Let D be the event that an even number of  coins are heads. 

(a)  Are these events pairwise independent? 

Solution.  The sample space consists of eight, equiprobable outcomes: 
{H, T }
 =
 {HHH, HH T , H T H, H T T , T HH, T H T , T T H, T T T } 
3 

Each sequence of three symbols speciﬁes the outcomes of the three coin tosses. 
The  ﬁrst  three  events  (A,  B ,  and  C )  are  pairwise  independent,  since  they  are  mutually 
independent.  All  that  remains  is  to  check  that  each  of  these  is  independent  of  D .  By 
symmetry, we need only check just one of the three, say A: 
Pr {A} =

Pr {D} =  Pr {{HH T , H T H, T HH, T T T }} =

(b)	 Are these events three­way independent? That is, does 
Pr {X  ∩ Y  ∩ Z } =  Pr {X } · Pr {Y } · Pr {Z } 
always hold when X , Y , and Z  are distinct events drawn from the set {A, B , C, D}? 
Solution.  Because the coin tosses are mutually independent, we know: 
Pr {A ∩ B ∩ C } =  Pr {A} · Pr {B } · Pr {C } . 
What remains is to check that equality holds for the other subsets of three events: {A, B , D}, 
{A, C, D}, and {B , C, D}. By symmetry, again, we need only check one, say the ﬁrst one. 
Pr {A ∩ B ∩ D} =  Pr {{HH T }} = 
1
.

Since this is equal to Pr {A} · Pr {B } · Pr {D}, these three events are independent.

We conclude that all four events are three­way independent.

(c)  Are these events mutually independent? 

Solution.  No, because: 
Pr {A ∩ B ∩ C  ∩ D} =  Pr {A} · Pr {B } · Pr {C } · Pr {D} 

The probability on the left is zero, but the product on the right is equal to 1/16.

Problem 2.  There is a set of 1000 people. 

•  The favorite color of 20% of these people is blue. 

•  The favorite color of 30% is green. 

•  The favorite color of 50% is red. 

(a)  Suppose we select a sequence of two distinct people (p1 , p2 ) by selecting p1  uniformly 
at random, and then selecting p2  uniformly at random among the remaining 999 people. 
Let the random variable Ci  be the favorite color of person pi . Are C1  and C2  independent? 
Justify your answer.

Solution.  No.  For example, 
Pr {C1  =  blue} Pr {C2  =  blue} = 

200 
1000 

. 

However, 

Pr {C2  =  blue  C1  =  blue} =

since 199 of the remaining 999 people like blue after one person who likes blue is selected.

.

(b)  Suppose we  select  a  sequence  of  two  people  (q1 , q2 )  uniformly  at  random.  (Now  it 
may be  that q1  =  q2 .)  Let  the random variable Di  be  the  favorite color of qi .  Now are D1 
and D2  independent?  Justify your answer. 

Solution.  Yes. Let c(p) be the color that person p likes. The random variables q1  and q2  are 
independent. Functions of independent random variables are independent, so C1  ::=   c(q1 ) 
� 
and C2  ::=  c(q2 ) are independent. 

Problem 3.  Suppose that we create a national database of DNA proﬁles. Let’s make some 
simplifying  assumptions  (for  the  purposes  of  this  problem,  don’t worry  about whether 
these assumptions are reasonable): 

•	 Each  person  can  be  classiﬁed  into  one  of  20 billion  different  “DNA  types”.  (For 
example,  you might  be  type  #13,646,572,661  and  the  person  next  to  you might  be 
type #2,785,466,098.) 

•	 Each DNA type is equally probable. 

•	 The DNA types of Americans are mutually independent. 

(a)  A  congressman  argues  that  there  are  only  about  250 million  Americans,  so  even  if 
a  proﬁle  for  every  American  were  stored  in  the  database,  the  probability  of  even  one 
coincidental match would be very small.  How many proﬁles must the database actually 
contain in order for the probability of at least one coincidental match be about 1/2? 
� 
Solution.  By  the  birthday principle,  the probability  of  a match  is  around half when  the 
number of entries is: 
· 
2 ln  2  20, 000, 000, 000  =  166, 511.

(b)  Person  x  is  arrested  for  a  crime  that  was  committed  by  person  y .  At  trial,  jurors 
must  determine whether  x  =  y .  The  crime  lab  says  x  and  y  have  the  same  DNA  type. 
The  prosecutor  argues  that  the  probability  that  x  and  y  are  different  people  is  only  1  in 
20  billion.  Let  T (x)  denote  the DNA  type  of  person  x.  Using  T ,  write  the  prosecutor ’s 
assertion in mathematical notation, and explain her error. 

Solution.  The prosecutor is asserting that: 
Pr {x  and y  are different people  T (x) =  T (y)} = 2  10−10  .
|
· 

This assertion is false using the probability model that is implicitly being assumed. Namely, 
we associate each person with a DNA­type­valued random variable with uniform distri­
· 
bution  over  the  2  10−10  types,  and  we  assume  all  these  variables  are  mutually  inde­
pendent.  We  also  consider  x  and  y  to  be  distinct  people­valued  independent  random 
· 
variables with uniform distribution over the 2.5  10−8  people in the US. 
With this model, the actual probability is 
Pr {x  =  y T (x) =  T (y)} =

, 

as we show below.

The prosecutor ’s argument sounds confusingly similar to a correct assertion:

Pr {T (x) =  T (y)  x  =  y} = 2  10−10  .
|
· 

The  prosecutor  can  validly  argue  that  either  an  amazing  1­in­20  billion  coincidence  in­
volving DNA has occurred or else x  and y  are the same person. On this basis, a jury might 
conclude that x  is guilty. 
On the other hand, the defense attorney could argue from (1) that, given the DNA match, 
· 
the  probability  that  x  is  not  guilty  is  much  greater  2  10−10 ,  but  is  in  fact  1/126.  He
could then argue to the jury that 125/126 does not meet the legal standard of being guilty 
“beyond reasonable doubt,” and so the jury should not convict x. 
To prove (1), note that 
Pr {x  =  y T (x) =  T (y)} = 1  − Pr {x  =  y T (x) =  T (y)} .

Problem  4.  Suppose  there  are  100  people  in  a  room.  Assume  that  their  birthdays  are 
independent and uniformly distributed. As stated in lecture: 

If there are N  days in a year and m  people in a room, then the probability that 
no two people in the room have the same birthday is very close to: 
e−m2 /(2N ) 

It follows that with probability >  99%  there will be two people with the same birthday. 
Now suppose you  learn  the birthdays of all  the people  in  the room except one—call her 
“Jane”—and ﬁnd all 99 dates to be different. 

(a)  What’s wrong with the following argument: 

With  probability  greater  than  99%,  some  pair  of  people  in  the  room  have 
the same birthday.  Since  the 99 people we asked all had different birthdays,  it 
follows  that  with  probability  greater  than  99%  Jane  has  the  same  birthday  as 
some other person in the room. 

Solution.  Here’s the problem with the argument: Let A  be the event that some two people 
in  the  room have  the  same birthday.  Let B  be  the  event  that  the  99 people we  asked  all 
have different birthdays.

It  is  true  that  Pr {A}  >  0.99   (that  is  indeed  the  probability  spoken  about  in  the  lecture 
notes).  However,  that  is  the  a  priori  probability,  that  is,  assuming  all  the  birthdays  are 
uniform  and  independent,  with  no  other  constraints.  The  argument  above  makes  the 
erroneous  assumption  that  event  A  has  probability  of  at  least  99%  even  once  we  know 
that  event  B  holds.  But  once we  know  that  event  B  holds,  the  birthdays  are  no  longer 
independent.  Thus  Pr {A B }  is  not  necessarily  equal  to  Pr {A}  (in  our  case,  they  are 
|
� 
actually quite different, as will be computed in part (b)). 

(b)  What is the actual probability that Jane has the same birthday as some other person 
in the room? 

Solution.  Let S  be  the  set of birthdays of  the 99 people  in  the  room other  than  Jane.  By 
assumption, |S | =  99. Let b  be the date of Jane’s birthday.  Since b  is uniformly distributed 
over a set of size 365, and b   is independent of all the birthdays in S , we have

where B  is the event that the 99 people we asked all have different birthdays.
