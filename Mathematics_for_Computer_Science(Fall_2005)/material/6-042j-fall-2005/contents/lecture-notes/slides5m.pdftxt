Connectedness 
Vertices v, w are connected iff 
there is a path starting at v and 
ending at w. 
A graph is connected iff every two

Cut Edges 

Cut Edges 

An edge is a cut edge if removing it 
from the graph disconnects two 
vertices.

Cut Edges and Cycles 
Lemma: An edge is a cut edge iff 
it is not part of a simple cycle. 

Proof: Class problem. 

Cut Edges 

Fault-tolerant design:

In a tree, every edge is a cut edge 

(bad)

In a mesh, no edge is a cut edge 

(good)

Tradeoff edges for failure tolerance

Other Tree Deﬁnitions 
Lemma: A tree is a connected graph 

with n vertices and n – 1  edges. 

Lemma:  A tree is an edge-minimal 

connected graph on a set of vertices.

Lemma:  A tree is a graph with a 

unique path between any 2 vertices.


Be careful with these deﬁnitions 

A tree is a graph with n vertices 

and n – 1 edges??

NO:
