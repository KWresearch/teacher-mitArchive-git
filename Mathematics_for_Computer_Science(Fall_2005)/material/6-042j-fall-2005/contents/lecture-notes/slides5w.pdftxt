order to accommodate them?

Final Exam Time Slots 
Two subjects conflict if a student 
is taking both. Assign conflicting 
subjects to different time slots, 
keeping exam period short.

Four Color Theorem 
Any planar map is 4-colorable. 
False proof published 1850’s

(was correct for 5 colors).

Proof with computer 

calculations: 1970’s.

Much improved: 1990’s
