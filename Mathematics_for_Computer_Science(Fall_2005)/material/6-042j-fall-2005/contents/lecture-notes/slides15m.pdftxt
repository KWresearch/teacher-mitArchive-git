Jacob D. Bernoulli (1659 – 1705) 
Even the stupidest man---by some instinct of 
nature per se and by no previous instruction 
(this is truly amazing) -- knows for sure that 
the more observations ...that are taken, the 
less the danger will be of straying from the 
mark.

Jacob D. Bernoulli (1659 – 1705) 
It certainly remains to be inquired whether 
after the number of observations has been 
increased, the probability…of obtaining the 
true ratio…finally exceeds any given 
degree of certainty; or whether the problem 
has, so to speak, its own asymptote---that 
is, whether some degree of certainty is 
given which one can never exceed.

Deviation from the Mean 
Pr{observed value far from 
expected value} 
is SMALL 
How small? 

Deviation from the Mean 
Observed value means

random variable, R.

far from may mean:

• distance or 
• amount above (or below)

Jacob D. Bernoulli (1659 – 1705) 
Therefore, this is the problem which I 
now set forth and make known after I 
twenty years
have pondered over it for 
. 
Both its novelty and its very great 
usefulness, coupled with its just as 
great difficulty, can exceed in 
weight and value all the remaining 
chapters of this thesis. 

The Principle Behind: 

• Estimation (polling) 
• Algorithm analysis 
• Design against failure 
• Communication thru noise 
• Gambling
