Gambler’s Ruin 
Parameters: 
n ::= initial capital (stake) 
T ::= gambler’s Target 
p ::= Pr{win $1 bet} 
q ::=1– p 
m ::= intended profit = T – n 

Gambler’s Ruin 
Three general cases: 
• Biased against 
• Biased in favor 
• Unbiased (Fair) 

p < 1/2 
p > 1/2 
p = 1/2

n=500, T=600 
Pr{win $100} = 500/600 ≈ 0.83

Astonishing Fact! 
Pr{win $100 starting with $500}

< 1/37,000 !

(was 5/6 in the unbiased case.)


Biased Against: p < 1/2 < q 
More amazing still! 
Pr{win $100 starting with $1M}

< 1/37,000 

Pr{win $100 starting w/ any $n stake}

< 1/37,000

So if the gambler keeps betting, 
he is sure to go broke.

Return to the origin. 

If you start at the origin and  

move left or right with equal  

probability, and keep moving in  

this way,  

Pr{return to origin} = 1 

How Many Bets? 
What is the expected number of

bets for the game to end?

– either by winning $(T-n) or  

by going broke  (losing $n).

How Many Bets?  Fair Case 
E[# bets] =  n(T−n) = 
(initial stake)⋅(intended profit) 
proof by solving linear recurrence: 
en  =  p(1 + en+1) +  q(1 + en-1) 

Fair Case for T  = ∞ 
Likewise, 
E[#bets for T = ∞] 
≥ E[#bets for T < ∞] 
= n(T-n) → ∞  (as T → ∞) 
So the expected #bets to go broke is 
infinite!
