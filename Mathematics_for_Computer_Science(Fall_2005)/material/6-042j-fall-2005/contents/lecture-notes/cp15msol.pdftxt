Problem 1.  The Pairwise Independent Sampling Theorem generalizes easily to sequences 
of pairwise  independent  random variables, possibly with different means and variances, 
as long as their variances are bounded by some constant: 
Theorem (Generalized Pairwise Independent Sampling).  Let X1 , X2 , . . .  be a sequence of 
pairwise independent random variables such that Var [Xi ] ≤ b for some b ≥ 0  and all i ≥ 1.  Let 
· · · +  Xn  ,

(a)  Prove the Generalized Pairwise Independent Sampling Theorem.  Hint:  The proof of 
the Pairwise Independent Sampling Theorem from the Notes is repeated in the Appendix. 
Solution.  Essentially identical to the proof attached, except that Var [Gi ] gets replaced by 
b, and the equality becomes ≤ where the b is ﬁrst used.

Solution.  For any ﬁxed �, the righthand side of (1) approaches 0 as n approaches inﬁnity.

Problem 2.  Write out a proof that 

Var [aR] =  a 2  Var [R] . 

Problem 3.  Finish discussing the “Explain sampling to a jury question” from last Friday.
