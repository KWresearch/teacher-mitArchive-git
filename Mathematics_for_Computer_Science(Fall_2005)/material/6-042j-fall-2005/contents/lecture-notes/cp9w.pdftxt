Problem 1.  A license plate consists of either: 

•  3 letters followed by 3 digits (standard plate) 

•  5 letters (vanity plate) 

•  2 characters – letters or numbers (big shot plate) 

Let L be the set of all possible license plates. 

(a)  Express L in terms of 

A =  {A, B , C, . . . , Z } 
D =  {0, 1, 2, . . . , 9} 

using unions (∪) and set products (×). 
(b)  Compute |L , the number of different license plates, using the sum and product rules.

Problem 2.  Let p be a prime and k a positive integer. 

(a)  How many positive integers less than pk  are divisible by p? 

(b)  What is the value, φ(pk ), of the Euler function at pk ? 

Problem  3.  For  each part below,  describe  a bijection between  the  two  sets mentioned.  The  exis­
tence of such a bijection proves that the two sets are the same size. 
A  good  approach  is  to  describe  an  element  of  the  ﬁrst  set  using  variables  and  then  describe  the 
corresponding  element of  the  second  set  in  terms of  those variables.  For example, we might de­
scribe  a  bijecton  from ways  of  selecting  a  dozen  doughnuts  from  ﬁve  varieties  to  a  16­bit  string 
with four 1’s as follows:

Everyone in your group should write out complete answers— you’ll all beneﬁt from the practice! 

(a)  Describe a bijection between the set of 30­bit sequences with 10 zeros and 20 ones and paths 
from (0, 0)   to (10, 20)  consisting of right­steps (which increment the ﬁrst coordinate) and up­steps 
(which increment the second coordinate). 

(b)  Find a bijection between the set of n­bit sequences and the set of all subsets of {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn}. 

(c)  Mr.  and Mrs.  Grumperson  have  collected  13  identical  pieces  of  coal  as  Christmas  presents 
for  their  beloved  children,  Lucy  and  Spud.  Describe  a  bijection  between  the  set  of  all  ways  of 
distributing  the  13  coal  pieces  to  the  two  children  and  the  set  of  14­bit  sequences with  exactly  1 
one.

(d)  On Christmas Eve, Mr.  and Mrs.  Grumperson  remember  that  they have  a  third  child,  little 
Bottlecap, locked in the attic. Describe a bijection between the set of all ways of distributing the 13 
coal pieces to the three children and the set of 15­bit sequences with exactly 2 ones. 

(e)  On  reﬂection,  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Grumperson  decide  that  each  of  their  three  children  should 
receive at least two pieces of coal for Christmas. Describe a bijection between the set of all ways of 
distributing the 13 coal pieces to the three Grumperson children given this constraint and the set 
of 9­bit sequences with exactly 2 ones. 

(f)  Describe a bijection between  the  set of 110­bit  sequences with  exactly 10 ones and  solutions 
over the natural numbers to the equation: 

x1  +  x2  +

+  x10  ≤  100

(g)  Describe  a  bijection  between  solutions  to  the  inequality  in  the  preceding  problem  part  and 
sequences (y1 , y2 , . . . , y10 ) such that: 
0  ≤ y1  ≤ y2  ≤  · · · ≤ y10  ≤ 100 

Problem 4.  A numbered tree is a tree whose vertex set is {1, 2, . . . , n} for some n ≥ 2. We deﬁne the 
code of the numbered tree to be a sequence of n − 2  integers from 1 to n obtained by the following 
recursive process: 

If n = 2, stop—the code is the empty sequence. Otherwise, write down the father of 
the largest leaf1 , delete this leaf, and continue the process on the resulting smaller tree. 

For example, the codes of a couple of numbered trees are shown in the Figure 1. 

Figure 1: 

(a)  Describe a procedure for reconstructing a numbered tree from its code. 

(b)  How many numbered trees with n vertices are there?  Justify your answer assuming the result 
of the previous problem part. 

1The necessarily unique node adjacent to a leaf is called its father
