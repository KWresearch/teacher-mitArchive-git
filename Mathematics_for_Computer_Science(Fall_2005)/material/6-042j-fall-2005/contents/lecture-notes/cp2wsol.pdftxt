Problem  1.  For  each of  the  logical  formulas,  indicate whether or not  it  is  true when  the domain 
of discourse  is N  (the  natural  numbers  0,  1,  2,  . . . ),  Z  (the  integers), Q  (the  rationals),  R  (the  real 
numbers), and C (the complex numbers).

Problem 2.  The goal of this problem is to translate some assertions about binary strings into logic 
notation. The domain of discourse is the set of all ﬁnite­length binary strings: λ, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 
000, 001, . . . .  (Here λ  denotes the empty string.)  In your translations, you may use all the ordinary 
logic symbols (including =), variables, and the binary symbols 0, 1 denoting 0, 1. 
A string like 01x0y  of binary symbols and variables denotes the concatenation of the symbols and 
the binary strings represented by the variables. For example, if the value of x  is 011 and the value 
of y  is 1111, then the value of 01x0y  is the binary string 0101101111. 
Here are some examples of formulas and their English translations. Names for these predicates are 
listed in the third column so that you can reuse them in your solutions (as we do in the deﬁnition 
of the predicate NO ­1 S  below).

Meaning 
x  is a preﬁx of y  
x  is a substring of y
x  is empty or a string of 0’s

Name 
PR E FIX (x,  y ) 
SU B S TR ING (x,  y )
NO ­1 S (x)

(a)  x  consists of three copies of some string. 
Solution.  ∃y  (x  =  yyy) 

(b)  x  is an even­length string of 0’s. 
Solution.  NO ­1 S(x) ∧ ∃y  (x  =  yy) 

(c)  x  does not contain both a 0 and a 1. 
[SU B S TR ING(0, x) ∧ SU B S TR ING(1, x)]
¬

Solution. 

(d)  x  is the binary representation of 2k  +  1 for some integer k  ≥ 0. 
Solution.  (x  =  10) ∨ (∃y  (x  =  1y1  ∧ NO ­1 S(y))) 

(e)  An elegant, slightly trickier way to deﬁne NO ­1 S(x) is: 

PR E FIX(x,  0x). 

Explain why (*) is true only when x  is a string of 0’s.

(*) 

Solution.  Preﬁxing x  with 0 rightshifts all the bits.  So the nth symbol of x  shifts into the (n  +  1)st 
symbol of  0x.  Now  for x  to be  a preﬁx of  0x,  the n  +  1st  symbol of  0x  must match  the  (n  +  1)st 
symbol of x.  So if x  satisﬁes (*), the nth and (n  +  1)st symbols of x  must match.  This holds for all 
n  >  0  up to the length of x, that is, all the symbols of x  must be the same.  In addition, if x  =� λ, it 
must start with 0. Therefore, if x  satisﬁes (*), all its symbols must be 0’s. 
Note that it’s easy to see, conversely, that if x  =  λ  or x  is all 0’s, then of course it satisﬁes (*).  � 

Problem 3.  A media tycoon has an idea for an all­news television network called LNN: The Logic 
News Network.  Each segment will begin with a deﬁnition of the domain of discourse and a few 
predicates.  The  day’s  happenings  can  then  be  communicated  concisely  in  logic  notation.  For 
example, a broadcast might begin as follows: 

Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 2, Wed. 
“THIS IS LNN. The domain of discourse is {Bill,  Monica,  Ken,   Linda,  Betty}.  Let D(x)  
be a predicate that is true if x  is deceitful. Let L(x,  y) be a predicate that is true if x  likes 
y . Let G(x,  y) be a predicate that is true if x  gave gifts to y .” 

3 

Complete the broadcast by translating the following statements into logic notation. 

(a)  If neither Monica nor Linda is deceitful, then Bill and Monica like each other. 

Solution. 

(¬(D(Monica) ∨ D(Linda)))  −→ (L(Bill,  Monica) ∧ L(Monica,   Bill)) 

(b)  Everyone except for Ken likes Betty, and no one except Linda likes Ken. 

Solution. 

x  (x  =  Ken ∧ ¬L(x,  Betty))  ∨ (x  =  Ken ∧ L(x,  Betty))  ∧
∀
x  (x  =  Linda ∧ L(x,   Ken))  ∨ (x  =  Linda ∧ ¬L(x,  Ken))
∀

(c)  If Ken is not deceitful, then Bill gave gifts to Monica, and Monica gave gifts to someone. 

Solution. 

¬D(Ken) −→ (G(Bill,  Monica) ∧ ∃ xG(Monica,  x)) 

(d)  Everyone likes someone and dislikes someone else. 

Solution. 

x∃y∃z  (y  =  z ) ∧ L(x,   y) ∧ ¬L(x,  z )
∀

(e)  How  could you express “Everyone except  for Ken  likes Betty” using  just propositional  con­
nectives without using  any  quantiﬁers  (∀,  ∃)?  Can  you  generalize  to  explain how  any  logical  for­
mula  over  this  domain  of  discourse  can  be  expressed  without  quantiﬁers?  How  big  would  the 
formula in the previous part be if it was expressed this way? 

Solution. 
L(Bill,  Betty) ∧ L(Monica,  Betty) ∧ L(Linda,  Betty) ∧ L(Betty,   Betty) ∧ ¬L(Ken,   Betty)

In general, quantiﬁers can be eliminated by treating ∀x P (x) as an abbreviation for 
P (Bill) ∧ P (Monica) ∧ P (Ken) ∧ P (Linda) ∧ P (Betty),  
and ∃x P (x) as an abbreviation for 
P (Bill) ∨ P (Monica) ∨ P (Ken) ∨ P (Linda) ∨ P (Betty). 

Expanded this way, the three­quantiﬁer formula of the previous part would expand by a factor of 
5 × 5 × 5  =   125.  So using quantiﬁers can pay off even when they are not strictly necessary.

Problem 4.  (a)  Explain why 

is valid. 

(∀z .  P (z , z ))  −→ ∀x∃y .  P (x, y) 

Solution.  Proof.  Assume 

∀z .  P (z , z ) 
is true for some domain and interpretation of the predicate P . We want to show that 
x∃y .  P (x, y) 
∀

(1) 

(2) 

(3)

also holds. 
So let c be an element of the domain. Then P (c, c) holds by assumption (2).  So there is a y , namely 
y =  c such that P (c, y) holds.  That is, ∃y .  P (c, y) is true.  But c could have been any element in the 
domain, so (by Universal Generalization), we conclude that (3) holds.

(b)  Describe a counter­model demonstrating that 
(∀x∃y .   P (x, y))  −→ ∀z .  P (z , z ) 

is not valid.

Solution.  Let  P (x, y)  mean  x  =  y .  Then  the  conclusion  ∀z .  z  =  z  is  always  false,  but  in  any

� 
domain with two or more elements, the hypothesis is true.
