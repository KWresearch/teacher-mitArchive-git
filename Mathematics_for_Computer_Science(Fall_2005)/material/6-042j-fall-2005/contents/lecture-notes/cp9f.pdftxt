Problem 1.  Solve  the  following problems using  the Pigeonhole Principle.  For  each problem,  try 
to identify the pigeons, the pigeonholes, and a rule assigning each pigeon to a pigeonhole. 

(a)  In a room of 500 people, there exist two who share a birthday. 

(b)  Every MIT  ID  number  starts with  a  9  (we  think).  Suppose  that  each  of  the  101  students  in 
6.042  sums  the  nine  digits  of  his  or  her  ID  number  and  doubles  the  result.  Explain  why  two 
students’ results must be the same. 

(c)  In every set of 100 integers, there exist two whose difference is a multiple of 37. 

(d)  For any ﬁve points inside a unit square, there are two points at distance less than 

.√
1
2 
(e)  For  any  ﬁve  points  inside  an  equilateral  triangle  of  side  length  2,  there  are  two  points  at 
distance less than 1. 

(f)  Prove  that  every  ﬁnite  undirected  graph  with  two  or  more  vertices  has  two  vertices  of  the 
same degree. 

Problem  2.  Your  6.001  tutorial  has  12  students,  who  are  supposed  to  break  up  into  4  groups  of 
3  students  each.  Your  TA  has  observed  that  the  students  waste  too  much  time  trying  to  form 
balanced groups, so he decided to pre­assign students to groups and email the group assignments 
to his students. 

(a)  Your  TA  has  a  list  of  the  12  students  in  front  of  him,  so  he  divides  the  list  into  consecutive 
groups of 3.  For example,  if  the  list  is ABCDEFGHIJKL,  the TA would deﬁne a sequence of  four 
groups  to  be  ({A,  B ,  C } ,  {D ,   E ,  F } ,  {G,  H,  I } ,  {J,   K,  L}).  This way  of  forming  groups  deﬁnes  a 
mapping from a list of twelve students to a sequence of four groups.  This is a k­to­1 mapping for 
what k? 

(b)  A  group  assignment  speciﬁes  which  students  are  in  the  same  group,  but  not  any  order  in 
which the groups should be listed.  If we map a sequence of 4 groups, 
({A,  B ,  C } ,  {D ,  E ,  F } ,  {G,  H,  I } ,  {J,   K,  L}), 

into a group assignment 

{{A,  B ,  C } ,  {D ,   E ,  F } ,  {G,  H,   I } ,  {J,  K,  L}} , 
this mapping is j ­to­1 for what j ?

(c)  How many group assignments are possible? 

(d)  In how many ways can 3n students be broken up into n groups of 3? 

Problem 3.  Answer the following quesions using the Generalized Product Rule. 

(a)  Next week, I’m going to get really ﬁt! On day 1, I’ll exercise for 5 minutes. On each subsequent 
day,  I’ll  exercise  0,  1,  2,  or  3  minutes  more  than  the  previous  day.  For  example,  the  number  of 
minutes  that  I  exercise  on  the  seven  days  of  next week might  be  5,  6,  9,  9,  9,  11,  12.  How many 
such sequences are possible? 

(b)  An r­permutation of a set  is a sequence of r  distinct elements of  that set.  For example, here 
are all the 2­permutations of {a, b, c, d}: 
(a, b)
(b, a)
(c, a)
(d, a)

(a, d) 
(b, d) 
(c, d) 
(d, c) 

(a, c)
(b, c)
(c, b)
(d, b)

How  many  r­permutations  of  an  n­element  set  are  there?  Express  your  answer  using  factorial 
notation. 
(c)  How many n × n matrices are there with distinct entries drawn from {1, . . . , p}, where p ≥ n

2 ?

Problem 4.  A certain company wants  to have security  for  their computer systems.  So  they have 
given everyone a name and password. A length 10 word containing each of the characters: 

a, d, e, f, i, l, o, p, r, s, 

is called a cword. A password will be a cword which does not contain any of the subwords ”fails”, 
”failed”, or ”drop”. 
For example, the following two words are passwords: 

adeﬁloprs, srpolifeda, 

but the following three cwords are not: 

adropeﬂrs, failedrops, dropefails. 

(a)  How many cwords contain the subword “drop”? 

(b)  How many cwords contain both “drop” and “fails”? 

(c)  Use the Inclusion­exclusion Principle to ﬁnd a simple formula for the number of passwords.

A  k­to­1  function  maps  exactly  k  elements  of  the  domain  to  every  element  of  the  range.  For 
example, the function mapping ears of 6.042 students to their owners is 2­to­1.

•  n3  possible third entries for each combination of ﬁrst and second entries,.
