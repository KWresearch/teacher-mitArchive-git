Planar Graphs


A graph is planar if there 
is a way to draw it in the plane 
without edges crossing.

Recursive Definition of Faces


Start with a vertex 
There is one face, whose boundary 
is the 0-length cycle consisting of 
this vertex.

Recursively adding an edge to a drawing

Two cases for connected graph: 
1) Attach edge from vertex on a 
face to a new vertex. 
2) Attach edge between 
nonadjacent vertices on a face.

Recursive Definition of Faces


Every connected planar 
drawing is obtained by 
starting with a single vertex, 
and repeatedly applying 
Rules 1 & 2.

Induction on Drawings


Properties of planar drawings 
like Euler’s formula can be 
proved by induction on the 
number of rule applications 
used to create a drawing.
