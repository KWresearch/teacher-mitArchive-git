Namely, let domain ::= { π}, 
Q(z) ::= [z = e], 
P(z) ::= [z = π]. 

Validities 
∀z [Q(z)∧P(z)] → [∀xQ(x) ∧ ∀yP(y)] 

Proof strategy:  We assume 
∀z [Q(z) ∧ P(z)] 
to prove
∀xQ(x) ∧∀yP(y).

Validities 
∀z [Q(z)∧P(z)] → [∀xQ(x) ∧ ∀yP(y)] 
∀z [Q(z)∧P(z)]. 
Proof: 
Assume 
So Q(z)∧P(z) holds for all z 
in the domain. 
c 
Now let  be some domain element. So 
Q(c)∧P(c) 
Q(c) by itself holds.

But c

So we conclude

We conclude ∀yP(y)
similarly. Therefore,
