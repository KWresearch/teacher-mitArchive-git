Number Theory III 

Permutation of a list 

A permutation of a list is just 
some reordering of it, e.g. 
4,1,3,2 Æ 1,2,3,4

10,2,14,2Æ 14,2,10,2

Some interesting permutations 
•  Backwards reordering 
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8  Æ  8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1

1,3,5,7,2,4,6,8  Æ  8,6,4,2,7,5,3,1

•  Sorting 
5,3,1,8,2,4,7,6 Æ 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 
•  Card shuffling 
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8  Æ 
(cut the deck) 1,2,3,4  5,6,7,8 Æ 
(combine) 1,5,2,6,3,7,4,8 

Last lecture’s lemmas 
Assume p prime, k ≠0 not a multiple of p then 
1. k has a multiplicative inverse mod p 
2. ak ≡bk (mod p)  ⇒a ≡b (mod p) 
3. (0⋅k) rem p, (1⋅k) rem p, …, ((p-1)⋅k) 
rem p  is a permutation of the sequence 
0,1,…,p-1 
4. Fermat’s theorem: kp-1 ≡1 (mod p)

Relatively Prime Numbers 

Do we have inverses?  Cancellation? 
Analogue of Fermat’s theorem?

L7-1.5 

•  a,b are relatively prime if gcd(a,b)=1 

• Examples:  
– Not relatively prime: 
• 2,4 
– Relatively prime: 
• 9,10 
• p,k if p is a prime and k not a multiple of p

Inverses mod n 

Cancellation 

Thm.  If k relatively prime to n then 
k has an inverse k-1 such that 
kk-1 ≡1 (mod n) 

Corr: If k relatively prime to n then 
ak ≡bk (mod n)  ⇒ 
a ≡b (mod n)

Permutations 

If k relatively prime to n  and k1…kr  are all

integers relatively prime to n for which   

0 <ki  < n then 

(k1 ⋅k)rem n, (k2 ⋅k)rem n, …,(kr ⋅k)rem n

is a permutation of the sequence k1,…,kr


Euler φfunction 
φ(n) = |{ j | 1 ≤j < n  gcd(j,n) =1}| 

Examples: 
φ(7) = 6 
1,2,3,4,5,6 
φ(49) = 42 
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,… 
φ(12) = 4 
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11

Euler φfunction

φ(n) = |{ j | 1 ≤j < n  gcd(j,n) ≡1}|


Theorem: 
1.  a,b relatively prime ⇒ φ(ab)= φ(a)φ(b) 
2.  p prime ⇒ φ(pk)= pk  – pk-1 for k ≥1 

Examples: 
φ(7) = 7-1=6 
1,2,3,4,5,6 
φ(49) = 49-7=42 
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,… 
φ(12) = φ(22) ⋅φ(3) = 2 ⋅2 = 4

Euler’s Theorem 

If k relatively prime to n then

kφ(n) ≡1 (mod n)


Note: If k relatively prime to n 
(n)-1 is k-1
then kφ

RSA Public Key Encryption 

Beforehand 

• 
• 
• 

• 

Receiver generates primes p,q 
n=pq (so φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1)) 
Selects e such that gcd(e,(p-1)(q-1))=1 
–  e is public key,  distributes e and n widely 
Computes d such that 
de ≡1 (mod (p-1)(q-1)) 
–  d is secret key,  keeps it hidden

RSA 

Why does this work? 

•  Encoding:  sender sends m’ = me  rem n 

•  Decoding:  receiver decrypts as                    
m=(m’)d  rem n 

•  Why is (m’)d  rem n = (me  rem n)d  rem n the 
same as the original message? 
– Will see why in class problem 2

Is it secure? 

•	 What notion of security? Against which 
kinds of attacks? 

•	 Can we at least show that deciphering the 
message implies the ability to factor n? 
– We don’t know how…
