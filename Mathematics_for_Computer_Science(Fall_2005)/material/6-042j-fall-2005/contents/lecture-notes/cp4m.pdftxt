Problem 1.  In each case, say whether or not R  is a equivalence relation on A.  If it is an equivalence 
relation, what are the equivalence classes and how many equivalence classes are there? 

(a)  R  ::=  {(x,  y) ∈ W  × W 
|
the words x  and y  start with the same letter} where W  is  the  set  of 
all words in the 2001 edition of the Oxford English dictionary. 
(b)  R  ::=  {(x,  y) ∈ W  × W 
| 
the words x  and y  have at least one letter in common}.
(c)  R  =  {(x,  y) ∈ W  × W  and the word x  comes before the word y  alphabetically}. 
(d)  R  =  {(x,  y) ∈ R × R and  x|
| ≤ |y |}. 
(e)  R  =  {(x,  y) ∈ B  × B , where B is the set of all bit strings and x and y have the same number of 
1s.} 

Problem 2. 

False Claim.  Suppose R  is a relation on A.  If R  is symmetric and transitive, then R  is reﬂexive. 

(a)  Give a counter­example to the claim. 

(b)  Find the ﬂaw in the following proof of the claim: 

False proof.  Let x  be an arbitrary element of A.  Let y  be any element of A  such  that xRy .  Since R 
is symmetric, it follows that yRx.  Then since xRy  and yRx, we conclude by transitivity that xRx. 
Since x  was arbitrary, we have shown that ∀x  ∈ A  (xRx), so R  is reﬂexive.

Problem 3.  Verify  that each of  the  following relations  is a partial order by describing a  function, 
g , such that the relation is deﬁned by g  according to the Deﬁnition 4.2 in the Appendix.  For each, 
is it a total order? 
(a)  The relation, <, on R. 
(b)  The superset relation, ⊇, on P (B ) for a set, B . 
(c)  The “divides” relation on natural numbers. 

Problem  4.  Suppose  you  are  given  the  description  of  an  equivalence  relation  and  want  to  cut 
down on  the number of pairs  that are  stored without  losing any  information.  For example, here 
are the pairs of an equivalence relation on a set of integers: 
G  ::=  {11,  33,  44,  55,  66,   77,  13,   31,  45,   54,  47,   74,  57,   75} . 
where for readability, we’ve written ”mk” to designate the pair (m,  k). 
To start, we know that if we have mk , then we necessarily also have km, so there’s no need to keep 
both. This lets us cut down to: 

{11,  33,  44,   55,  66,   77,  13,   45,   47,  57} . 
Also, if we have 45 and 57, we don’t need 47, since that will necessarily be there (by transitivity), 
so we can further cut down to 

{11,  33,  44,   55,  66,   77,  13,   45,   57} 
In addition, as long as we keep some pair in which k  appears, we don’t need the pair kk . This lets 
us cut down to the pairs 
{66,  13,   45,  57} . 
(1) 
These pairs are all that are needed to determine the entire original equivalence relation, G. More­
over, the set (1) of these pairs is minimal with this property; this means that if any pair was removed 
from the set, it wouldn’t determine the relation any more. 

(a)  Describe another couple of minimal sets of pairs that determine the relation. 

(b)  Here  are  the  pairs  that  are  left  after  some  unnecessary  pairs  have  been  removed  from  the 
description  of  an  equivalence  relation,  E .  What  is  the  domain  of  E ?  What  are  the  equivalence 
classes of E ? 

15,  20,  40,   57,  68,   79,  9a,  bb,  c3 

(c)  On  a  domain  of  n  elements,  what  is  the  smallest  number  of  pairs  that  could  determine  an 
equivalence relation? 

(d)  Suppose you have an equivalence relation on a domain of size n  with k  equivalence classes, 
with no  classes  of  just  one  element.  Then  every minimal  set  of pairs has  the  same  size.  What  is 
that size? Explain.

Equivalence 

3 

Deﬁnition 4.1.  A binary relation, R, on a set, A,  is an equivalence relation iff there is a function, f , 
with domain A, such that 

a1  R a2 

iff  f (a1 ) =  f (a2 ) 

(2) 

for all a1 ,  a2  ∈ A. 
Theorem.  A relation is an equivalence iff it is reﬂexive, symmetric and transitive. 

Partial Order 

Deﬁnition 4.2.  A relation, R, on a set, A, is a partial order providing there is a function, g , from A 
to some collection of sets such that 

a1  R a2 

iff  g(a1 ) ⊂ g(a2 ), 

(3) 

for all a1  =  a2  ∈ A. 
Theorem.  A relation is a partial order iff it is transitive and antisymmetric. 

Relational Properties 

A binary relation, R, on a set, A, is 
•  reﬂexive if aRa  for every a  ∈ A, 
•  irreﬂexive if aRa   holds for no a  ∈ A, 
•  symmetric if for every a,  b   ∈ A, aRb   implies bRa, 
•  antisymmetric if for every a  =  b  ∈ A, aRb  implies ¬(bRa), 
•  asymmetric if for every a,  b   ∈ A, aRb  implies ¬(bRa), 
•  transitive if for every a,   b,  c  ∈ A, aRb  and bRc  implies aRc.
