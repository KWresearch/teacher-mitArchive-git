Definition 
An Undirected Graph is a set of 

vertices V and a set of edges E

where each edge is an unordered 

pair of distinct vertices a and b.

a—b (edge ab) = {a,b} 
Degree of a vertex v is the number 

of edges it connects to.

deg(a) = 2 

deg(b) = 4

“same” graph, different labels 

Graphs G1  and G2  are isomorphic if 
there exists a bijection  f: V1 → V2  such that 
for all u,v in V1 
u—v is in E1 
f(u)—f(v) is in E2 
iff 
There is a one-to-one correspondence 
between the nodes of G1  and G2  that 
preserves all edge connections.

Finding the Mapping 

•  Not easy, can try all possible mappings 
– Roughly n! possibilities 

•  Can test for Invariants 
– Same number of nodes, edges 
– Same degree distributions 
– Preserves cycles, longest path, etc
