Problem 1.  Here are seven propositions: 
∨ ¬x7 
x1  ∨ 
x3
¬x5  ∨ 
x6  ∨ 
x7
∨ ¬x4  ∨ 
x2 
x6
¬x4  ∨ 
∨ ¬x7 
x5
x3  ∨ ¬x5  ∨ ¬x8 
∨ ¬x8  ∨ 
x9 
x2
x9  ∨ 
¬x3  ∨ 
x4

Note that: 

1.  Each proposition is the OR of three terms of the form xi  or the form ¬xi . 
2.  The variables in the three terms in each proposition are all different. 

Suppose  that  we  assign  true/false  values  to  the  variables  x1 , . . . , x9  independently  and 
with equal probability. 

(a)  What is the probability that a single proposition is true? 

(b)  What is the expected number of true propositions? 

(c)  Use your answer to prove that there exists an assignment to the variables that makes 
all of the propositions true.

Problem 2.  Final exams in 6.042 are graded according to a rigorous procedure: 

•	 With  probability  4/7  the  exam  is  graded  by  a  recitation  instructor,  with  probability 
2/7  it  is  graded  by  a  lecturer,  and  with  probability  1/7,  it  is  accidentally  dropped 
behind the radiator and arbitrarily given a score of 84. 

•	 Recitation  instructors score an exam by scoring each problem  individually and  then 
taking the sum. 

–	 There are  ten  true/false questions worth 2 points each.  For each,  full credit  is 
given with probability 3/4, and no credit is given with probability 1/4. 
–	 There  are  four  questions  worth  15  points  each.  For  each,  the  score  is  deter­
mined by rolling two fair dice, summing the results, and adding 3. 
–	 The single 20 point question is awarded either 12 or 18 points with equal prob­
ability. 

•	 Lecturers score an exam by rolling a fair die twice, multiplying the results, and then 
adding a “general impression” score. 

–	 With probability 4/10, the general impression score is 40. 
–	 With probability 3/10, the general impression score is 50. 
–	 With probability 3/10, the general impression score is 60. 

Assume all random choices during the grading process are mutually independent. 

(a)  What is the expected score on an exam graded by a recitation instructor? 

(b)  What is the expected score on an exam graded by a lecturer? 

(c)  What is the expected score on a 6.042 exam? 

Problem 3.  The number of squares that a piece advances in one turn of the game Monopoly 
is determined as follows: 

•	 Roll two dice, take the sum of the numbers that come up, and advance that number 
of squares. 

•	 If you roll doubles (that is, the same number comes up on both dice), then you roll a 
second time, take the sum, and advance that number of additional squares. 

•	 If  you  roll  doubles  a  second  time,  then  you  roll  a  third  time,  take  the  sum,  and 
advance that number of additional squares.

•	 However,  as  a  special  case,  if  you  roll  doubles  a  third  time,  then  you  go  to  jail. 
Regard this as advancing zero squares overall for the turn. 

(a)  What  is  the  expected  sum  of  two  dice,  given  that  the  same  number  comes  up  on 
both? 

(b)  What  is  the expected sum of  two dice, given  that different numbers come up?  (Use 
your previous answer and the Total Expectation Theorem.) 

(c)  To  simplify  the  analysis,  suppose  that we  always  roll  the dice  three  times,  but may 
ignore the second or third rolls if we didn’t previously get doubles.  Let the random vari­
able Xi  be  the sum of  the dice on  the  i­th  roll, and  let Ei  be  the event  that  the  i­th  roll  is 
doubles. Write the expected number of squares a piece advances in these terms. 

(d)  What is the expected number of squares that a piece advances in Monopoly?
