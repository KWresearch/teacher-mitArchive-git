Problem 1.  This problem lets you practice proving simple facts about divisibility. 
(a)  Prove:  If a b  and a  | c, then a   sb   +  tc  for all s,  t.
|
| 
Solution.  Suppose  that a  |  b  and a c.  Then  there exist  integers k1  and k2  such  that ak1  =  b  and
|
ak2  =  c. Thus, sb  +  tc  =  s(ak1 ) +  t(ak2 ) =  a(sk1  +  tk2 ), which implies that a  | sb  +  tc.

(b)  A  number  is  perfect  if  it  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  its  positive  divisors,  other  than  itself.  For 
example, 6 is perfect, because 6  = 1 + 2 + 3.  Similarly, 28 is perfect, because 28  = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. 
Explain why 2k−1 (2k  − 1)  is perfect if 2k  − 1  is prime. 
Solution.  If 2k  − 1  is prime, then the only divisors of 2k−1 (2k  − 1)  are:

Problem 2.  Suppose that we have water jugs with capacities a  and b. Use induction to prove that 
the amount of water  in each  jug  is always a  linear  combination of a  and  b  and at  least one  jug  is 
either empty or full.  Recall  that  the allowable operations are  to ﬁll a  jug with water, empty a  jug 
onto the sidewalk, or to transfer water from one jug to another until one the ﬁrst one is empty or 
the second one is full. 
In Die Hard  6,  the water  jugs have  capacities  3  and  6  gallons,  and Bruce must  form  4  gallons  of 
water. As a corollary to the above, prove that Bruce dies.

Solution.  To prove the ﬁrst part, we use induction. Let P (n) be the proposition that after n   steps, 
the amount of water in each jug is a linear combination of a  and b. 
·
· 
Base case. P (0)  is true, because both jugs are initially empty, and 0 a  +  0 b  = 0.
Inductive  step.  Now we must  show  that P (n) implies P (n  +  1)  for n  ≥  0.  So assume  that after n 
steps the amount of water in each jug is a linear combination of a  and b. There are two cases: 

•	 If we ﬁll a  jug from the fountain or empty a  jug  into the fountain,  then that  jug  is empty or 
full. The amount in the other jug remains a linear combination of a  and b.  So P (n  + 1)  holds. 

•	 Otherwise, we pour water from one jug to another until one is empty or the other is full.  By 
our assumption,  the amount  in each  jug  is a  linear combination of a  and b  before we begin 
pouring: 

·
· 
j1  =  s1  a  +  t1  b
·
· 
j2  =  s2  a  +  t2  b

After pouring,  one  jug  is  either  empty  (contains  0  gallons)  or  full  (contains  a  or  b  gallons). 
Thus,  the other  jug  contains  either  j1  +  j2  gallons,  j1  +  j2  − a,  or  j1  +  j2  − b  gallons,  all of 
which are linear combinations of a  and b. 

The lemma follows by the principle of induction. 
We now show that Bruce dies.  The amount in each jug is always of the form 3s  +  6t  by the above 
� 
lemma. This is always a multiple of 3 by Problem 1.a, so he can not measure out 4 gallons. 

Problem 3.  Prove: Every common divisor of a  and b  divides gcd(a,  b). 

|
Solution.  For some s  and t, gcd(a,  b) =  sa  +  tb.  Let c  be a common divisor of a  and b.  Since c a  
and c  | b, we know that c  divides sa  +  tb  =  gcd(a,  b) by part (a) of problem 1.

Problem  4.  There  is  a  pond.  Inside  the  pond  there  are  n  pebbles,  arranged  in  a  cycle.  A  frog  is 
sitting on one of the pebbles. Whenever he jumps, he lands exactly k  pebbles away in the clockwise 
direction, where 0  <  k < n. The frog’s meal, a delicious worm, lies on the pebble right next to his, 
in the clockwise direction. 
(a) Describe a situation where the frog can’t reach the worm. 
Solution.  If k  | n  (say k  = 3  and n  = 6), then no number of jumps will lead the frog to the worm, 
� 
as the frog will be returning to his original pebble ad inﬁnitum.

(b)  In a  situation where  the  frog  can actually  reach  the worm,  explain how  to use  the Pulverizer 
(see the appendix of this handout for a description of the Pulverizer) to ﬁnd how many jumps the 
frog will need. 

Solution.  Suppose  the  frog  can  reach  the worm.  When  he  actually  reaches  it,  he  has  jumped  a 
number of  times,  say  j ,  and he has  travelled around  the  cycle a number of  times,  call  it  c.  Then, 
·
· 
the distance that the frog has covered is both j k  and c n  +  1, so that 

j k  =  cn   +  1.  

But this means that 1  can be written as a linear combination of n   and k : 

(−c)n   +  j k  = 1.  

Since 1  is positive, we conclude that it is a positive linear combination of n  and k . And since it is the 
smallest positive integer, we also conclude that it is the smallest positive linear combination of n  and 
k . But we have seen in lecture that the smallest positive linear combination of two integers is their 
GCD. So, the GCD of n  and k  is 1: 

gcd(n,   k) = 1 

and we can use the Pulverizer to ﬁnd −c  and j . 

� 

(c) Compute the number of jumps if n  = 50  and k  = 21. Anything strange? 

Solution.  We go through the steps as described in the appendix to get that 1  = 8 50  − 19  21, or 
·
· 
1 =  −(−8)   · 50  +  (−19)  · 21.  Hence, c  =  −8  and j  =  −19, which makes  little sense.  What does  it 
mean for the frog to make −19  jumps? 

The point is that the Pulverizer is guaranteed to give us the integers coefﬁcients of a linear combi­
nation that equals the GCD, but it promises nothing about the signs of those coefﬁcients —which, 
in  this  case we  wanted  them  to  be  −  and  +.  To  get  coefﬁcients  of  the  desired  sign,  we  have  to 
think more. 
So, we know 1  = 8 50  − 19  21. Or, to obtain meaningful signs for the numbers, 19  21  = 8 50  − 1.
·
· 
·
· 
That  is,  after  19  jumps  the  frog will  have  covered  8  full  cycles  but  1  pebble.  So,  he will  be  right 
next  to his original pebble,  but  in  the  counter­clockwise direction.  Given  this,  how  can he  reach 
the pebble he is after? 

Well,  if  he makes  19  more  jumps,  he  will  land  2  pebbles  away  from  his  original  position  in  the 
counter­clockwise direction.  Another 19  jumps will  lead him 3 pebbles away,  and so on.  After a 
total of  49   sets of  19  jumps,  he will be  49  pebbles  away  from  its original position  in  the  counter­
clockwise direction, which is of course the worm’s pebble. Then, the frog will have made 49 ∗ 19  = 
931  jumps.

A  Appendix: The Pulverizer 

� 

Euclid’s algorithm for ﬁnding the GCD of two numbers relies on repeated application of the equa­
tion: 

gcd(a,  b) =  gcd(b,  a  rem b) 
For example, we can compute the GCD of 259 and 70 as follows: 
since 259   rem 70   = 49 
since 70  rem 49  = 21 
since 49  rem 21  = 7 
since 21  rem 7   = 0 

gcd(259,   70)	 =  gcd(70,  49) 
=  gcd(49,  21) 
=  gcd(21,  7) 
=  gcd(7,  0) 
= 7. 

The Pulverizer goes through the same steps, but requires some extra bookkeeping along the way: 
as we compute gcd(a,  b), we keep track of how to write each of the remainders (49, 21, and 7, in the 
example) as a  linear combination of a  and b  (this  is worthwhile, because our objective  is  to write 
the  last  nonzero  remainder,  which  is  the GCD,  as  such  a  linear  combination).  For  our  example, 
here is this extra bookkeeping:

We  began  by  initializing  two  variables,  x  =  a  and  y  =  b.  In  the  ﬁrst  two  columns  above,  we 
carried  out Euclid’s  algorithm.  At  each  step, we  computed x  rem y , which  can be written  in  the 
form x  − q · y .  (Remember that the Division Algorithm says x  =  q · y + r , where r  is the remainder. 
We  get  r  =  x  −  q  ·  y  by  rearranging  terms.)  Then  we  replaced  x  and  y  in  this  equation  with 
equivalent  linear  combinations  of  a  and  b,  which we  already  had  computed.  After  simplifying, 
we were left with a linear combination of a  and b  that was equal to the remainder as desired.  The 
ﬁnal solution is boxed.
