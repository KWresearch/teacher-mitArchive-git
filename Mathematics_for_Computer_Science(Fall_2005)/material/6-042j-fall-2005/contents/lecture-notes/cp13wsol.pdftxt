Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 13, Wed.


Problem 1.  The  following  two parts are not related.  Try  them,  to make sure you understand  the 
jargon of  random variables, distributions, probability density  functions,  etc.  Ask your TA  if you 
don’t understand/remember what some phrase means. 

(a)  Suppose X1 , X2 , and X3  are three mutually independent random variables, each having the 
uniform distribution 
Pr {Xi  =  k}  equal to 1/3  for each of k  = 1,   2,   3. 
Let M  be another random variable giving the maximum of these three random variables. What is 
the density function of M ? 
Solution.  This can be hashed out by counting the possible outcomes. Alternatively, we can reason

as follows:

The  event M  = 1   is  the  event  that  all  three of  the variables  equal 1,  and  since  they are mutually 

� �31
independent, we have

To  compute Pr {M  = 2}, we ﬁrst  compute Pr {M  ≤ 2}.  Now  the  event  [M  ≤  2]  is  the  event  that 
all three of the variables is at most 2, so by mutual independence we have � �3

Pr {M  ≤ 2}  =  Pr {X1  ≤ 2} · Pr {X2  ≤ 2} · Pr {X3  ≤ 2} =

(m,  p), respectively. What is Pr {X  +  Y  =  k}?

Solution.  The  PDF  of  X  is  the  probability  of  tossing  k  Heads  out  of  n  independent  ﬂips  of  a 
coin with bias p.  Likewise for Y  and m  ﬂips.  Since, X  and Y  are independent, the PDF of X  +  Y 
�

corresponds to n+m  independent ﬂips, i.e., X +Y  is a Binomial variable with parameters (n+m,  p). 
Hence,

Problem  2.  I know  everything.  Seriously.  So,  I know  everything  that  everybody  thinks.  In par­
ticular,  I  know  who  each  one  of  the  750  billion  members  of  the  galaxy  want  to  vote  for  in  the 
upcoming elections for the Intergalactic president.  I know that a fraction p  = 0.52  of them want to 
vote for the current president. 
You  are mortal.  An  insigniﬁcant dot  in  space­time.  But  a quite  signiﬁcant dot  among dots.  You 
work closely to the current Intergalactic president and, within a week, you must answer his ago­
nizing question:  “Am I winning?” Or, in math jargon (but with the same agony):  “Is p >  1/2?” 
Your ﬁrst  idea  is to ask me (I know everything).  But you haven’t talked to me for a  long time, so 
you know  I won’t  tell you.  Your  second  idea  is  to  call  every person  in  the galaxy,  ask  them,  then 
divide the yes’s by 750 billion.  But you soon realize there is not enough time (there is a reason for 
representative democracy).  Your  third  idea. . .  You have no  third  idea!  In your panic as  the week 
is almost over, you start picking galaxy members at random, call them, and ask! 
Amazingly,  that’s  the  correct  approach.  But  you  should  be  careful what  you  are  going  to  say  to 
the president! Let’s see. 

(a)  In  your  ﬁrst  phone  call,  you  pick  one  galaxy  member  uniformly  at  random,  call,  and  ask 
whether  he/she will  vote  for  the  president.  What  is  the  probability  that  the  answer  is  going  to 
be  “yes”. . .  (i)  from my  perspective?  (ii)  from  your  perspective?  How would  you model  this  in 
terms of coin ﬂips? 

Solution.  From my perspective, it’s 0.52.  From your perspective, it is also 0.52. The only problem 
is that you don’t know that, so you just call it p. Clearly, from your perspective, the ﬁrst phone call 
� 
is the same as ﬂipping a coin with an unknown bias, which you call p  (and I know is 0.52). 

(b)  In your second phone call, you again pick a galaxy member uniformly at random, call, and ask 
whether he/she will vote for the president.  But wait!  When selecting the second voter, shouldn’t 
you exclude the guy that you asked in the ﬁrst phone call?  Maybe, but what complication comes 
from excluding him/her? 

Solution.  If you do this, you alter the coin that you are ﬂipping. The bias will decrease or increase, 
depending on whether  the ﬁrst guy said “yes” or “no”,  respectively.  The analysis gets messy,  so 
� 
you don’t want to do this.

(c)  So, in each one of n  phone calls, you pick a galaxy member uniformly at random and ask. Your 
plan is to eventually divide the number, Y  , of “yes” answers by n  to get P  ::=  Y /n. An MIT friend 
tells you that, as the numerical outcome of a random experiment, this P  is a random variable, and 
that, according to his calculations, 
Pr {|P  − p| 
When  you  are  done  calling  people,  you  divide  to  get  P ,  and  it’s  0.53.  You  call  the  president  up 
and. . .  what do you say? 
(1)  Mr. President, p  = 0.53! 
(2)  Mr. President, with probability at least 95%, p  is within 0.03 of 0.53! 
(3)  Mr. President, either p  is within 0.03 of 0.53 or something very strange (less than 5­in­100) has 
happened. 

≤ 0.03} ≥  0.95.

For each statement answer:  (i) Are you justiﬁed to claim it?  (ii) Is it true? 
Solution.  Statement (1) is clearly off the mark. 

(i)  Since  you  haven’t  asked  all  galaxy  members,  you  can  only  make  probabilistic  statements 
about p. 
(ii)  Statement (1) is also false, since p  = 0.52. However, with a different choice of voters, it could 
have been true. Of course, even in that case, you wouldn’t be justiﬁed in making it. 

It would be wrong for you to make statement (2). 

(i)  The unknown fraction, p,  is a constant, not a random variable.  It  is either within 0.03 of 0.53, 
or more than 0.03 away of 0.53.  It doesn’t make much sense to talk about the probability that 
it has this, or any other, property:  it does or it doesn’t. And since you don’t know which case 
holds, it would be wrong for you to make statement (2) about p. 
(ii)  Now you could argue  that statement  (2)  is actually  true  in  this case.  Namely,  since  the con­
stant  p  is  0.52,  it  is  indeed  within  0.03  of  0.53.  So  you  might  claim  that  the  probability  in 
question is actually 1, and therefore is indeed at least 95%. But introducing probability in this 
way is misleading, at best. 

Statement (3) is the correct one. 

(i)  You are justiﬁed in making statement (3). To see why, start with the statement 
0.53  − p >  0.03.
0.53  − p ≤ 0.03 
|

or 
either 
which  is  clearly  true.  Now  read  it  as  follows:  Either  p  is within  0.03  of  0.53  or  it  is  not  and 
therefore my random random variable, P ,  took a value  from a set  that  is hit only 5  times  in 
100.  So, clearly either p  is within 0.03 of 0.53, or something strange has happened. 
(ii)  Statement  (3)  is  true.  In  this particular  case,  it  is  true because  the ﬁrst half of  it  is  true.  But 
it would still be true even if p  was not within 0.03 of 0.53.  That’s because statement (3) is an 
assertion about the behavior of the random variable, P , that is true no matter what the value 
of p  is, so you can legitimately make the statement without knowing what p  really is.

A  third  problem  that  originally  appeared  here  has  been  deleted.  Few,  if  any,  teams  got  to  this 
problem; it will be postponed for a later class problem session.
