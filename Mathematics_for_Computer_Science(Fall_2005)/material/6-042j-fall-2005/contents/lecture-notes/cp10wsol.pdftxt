Solution.  The sum is over all 4­tuples of nonnegative integers (r1 , r2 , r3 , r4 ) such that 

r1  + r2  + r3  + r4  = n.

Combinatorial proofs of identities 
Recall the basic plan for a combinatorial proof of an identity x = y : 

1.  Deﬁne a set S . 
2.  Show that |S | = x by counting one way. 
3.  Show that |S | = y by counting another way. 
4.  Conclude that x = y . 

Problem  3.  You  want  to  choose  a  team  of  m  people  from  a  pool  of  n  people  for  your  startup

company,  and  from  these  m  people  you  want  to  choose  k  to  be  the  team  managers.  You  took

Before doing the reasonable thing —dump on your CFO or Harvard Business School— you decide 
to check his answer against yours.

k managers from the n people and then choose m− k people to ﬁll out the team from the remaining

Hint: Let S be the set of all length­n sequences of 0’s, 1’s and a single *. 
Solution.  Let P ::=  {0, . . . , n − 1} × {0, 1} n−1 . On the one hand, there is a bijection from P  to S by 
mapping (k , x) to the word obtained by inserting a * just after the kth bit in the length­n − 1 binary 
word, x.  So

Learning to count takes practice! The following problems offer some. 

Problem 5.  A pizza house is having a promotional sale. Their commercial reads: 

We  offer  9  different  toppings  for  your  pizza!  Buy  3  large  pizzas  at  the  regular  price, 
and you can get each one with as many different toppings as you wish, absolutely free. 
That’s 22,  369,   621  different ways to choose your pizzas! 

The ad writer was a former Harvard student who had evaluated the formula (29 )3/3!   on his calcu­
lator and gotten close to 22,  369,   621. Unfortunately, (29 )3/3!   is obviously not an integer, so clearly 
something  is  wrong.  What  mistaken  reasoning  might  have  led  the  ad  writer  to  this  formula? 
Explain how to ﬁx the mistake and get a correct formula. 

Solution.  The  number  of  ways  to  choose  toppings  for  one  pizza  is  the  number  of  the  possible 
subsets of the set of 9 toppings, namely, 29 . The ad writer presumably then used the Product Rule 
to  conclude  that  there were  (29 )3  sequences of  three  topping  choices.  Then he probably  reasoned 
that  each  way  of  making  three  topping  choices  arises  from  3!  sequences,  so  the  Division  Rule 
would imply that the number of ways to choose three pizzas is (29 )3/3!. 
It’s true that every set of three different topping choices arises from 3!  different length­3 sequences 
of choices. The mistake is that if some of the three choices are the same, then the set of three choices 
arises from fewer than 3!  sequences.  For example, if all three pizzas have the same toppings, there 
is only one sequence of topping choices for them. 
One ﬁx is to consider ways to choose toppings with 1,2 and 3 different topping choices.  There are 
29 (29  − 1)(29  − 2)/3!  ways  to  choose  a  set  of  3  different  choices,  29 (29  − 1)  ways  to  choose  one 
topping choice  to be used on  two pizzas and a second choice  for  the  third pizza,  and 29  ways  to 
choose one topping for all three pizzas, giving 
29 (29  − 1)(29  − 2)
3! 

+  29 (29  − 1)  +  29  = 22,  500,  864.

ways to choose three pizzas. 
Alternatively, we  can observe  that  this  is exactly  the problem of  selecting a dozen donuts of ﬁve 
possible different kinds – except now there are 3 donuts and 29  kinds.  Hence,  there  is a bijection

Problem 6.  (a)  In how many different ways can Blockbuster arrange 64 copies of 13 conversations 
about one thing, 96 copies of L’Auberge Espagnole and 1 copy of Matrix Revolutions on a shelf? What 
if they are to be arranged in 5 shelves? 

Solution.  For  1  shelf,  this  is  the  number  of  ways  to  arrange  64  C ’s,  96  A’s,  and  1  M .  By  the 
bookeeper rule: 

(64  +  96  +  1)! 
64!  96!  1!  
For 5 shelves, we can do the simple trick of introducing the dividers between the shelves as new 
objects.  That is, we want the number of ways to arrange 64 C ’s, 96 A’s, 1 M , and 4 X ’s (dividers). 
By the bookeeper theorem, again: 

(64  +  96  +  1 +  4)!  
64!  96!  1!   4!

(b)  Set A has r  elements and set B has n elements.  How many functions are there from A to B ? 
How many of them are injective (one­to­one)? How many of them are bijective? 
Solution.  Say A =  {a1 , . . . , ar } and B  =  {b1 , . . . , bn} and consider the mapping that sends every 
→
function f  :  A
B to the sequence (f (a1 ), . . . , f (ar )). This is a bijection between functions from A
to B and r­long sequences of elements from B . By the product rule, the number of such sequences

is 
n · · ·
n =  n .
r 
r  times 
For  injections, ﬁrst note  that  (by  the pigeonhole principle)  there  is no way  to  inject A into B if B 
has  fewer  elements  than A.  That  is:  if  r  > n,  then  the  number  of  injections  from A to B  is  0.  If 
r  ≤ n, though, the same mapping as previously becomes a bijection between injections from A to 
B and r­long sequences of distinct elements from B .  By the generalized product rule, the number 
of such sequences is 

n · (n − 1)  · (n − 2) · · · (n − r +  1)  =

n! 
(n − r)! , 

that is, the number of r­permutations of n elements. 
For  bijections,  we  similarly  note  that  in  the  case  r  =�
n  the  number  of  bijections  from  A  to  B 
is  0.  If  r  =  n,  then  a  function  from  A  to  B  is  a  bijection  iff  it  is  an  injection.  So  the  number 

Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 10, Wed. 
6 
of  bijections  equals  the  number  of  injections:  n!/(n  − n)!  =  n!,  which  is  exactly  the  number  of 
different permutations of n  elements.

Notice how functions, injections, and bijections correspond respectively to sequences, r­permutations,

and permutations. 

(c)  Find the number of 5­card hands in which every suit appears at most twice.

Solution.  There are  two cases.  Either one suit appears  twice or else  two suits appear  twice.  The 
·

number of hands in which one suit appears twice is  13

the doubly­represented suit,  13   ways to choose two values from this suit, and 133  ways to choose

values  for  cards  in  the  three  remaining  suits.  Similarly,  the number of hands  in which  two  suits

(d)  How many paths are there from point (0,  0)  to (50,  50)  if every step increments one coordinate 
and  leaves  the  other  unchanged?  if  there  are  impassable  boulders  sitting  at  points  (10,  10)  and 
(20,  20)?  Hint:  Count  the  number  of  paths  going  through  (10,  10),  the  number  through  (20,   20),
