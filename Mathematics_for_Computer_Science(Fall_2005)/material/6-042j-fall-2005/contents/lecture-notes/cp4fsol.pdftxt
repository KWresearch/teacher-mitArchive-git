Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 4, Fri. 

Problem 1.  (a)  For any vertex, v , in a graph, let v� be the set of vertices adjacent to v , that is, 
� 
� 
�
v  ::=  v �  | v—v �  is an edge of the graph  . 
Suppose f   is an isomorphism from graph G  to graph H . Carefully prove that f (v�) =  f�(v). 
Solution.  We ﬁrst show that f�(v) ⊆ f (v�) by showing that if w  ∈ f�(v), then w   ∈ f (v�). 
Now  w  ∈  f�(v)  means  that  w—f (v)  is  an  edge  of  H .  Since  f  is  an  isomorphism,  there must  be 
by  deﬁnition  of  isomorphism.  This means  v �  ∈  v�,  and  so  f (v � )  ∈  f (v�) by  deﬁnition  of  f (v�).  So 
some v �  such  that w  =  f (v � ).  So f (v � )—f (v) is an edge of H , and  therefore v �—v  is an edge of G, 
w  =  f (v � ) ∈ f (v�), as required. 
Conversely, we show that f (v�) ⊆ f�(v) by showing that if w  ∈ f (v�), then w   ∈ f�(v). 
But w  ∈  f (v�) means that w  =  f (v � ) for some v �  adjacent to v  in G.  This means v—v �  is an edge of 
f (v); in other words, w  ∈ f�(v), as required. 
G,  and  so  f (v)—f (v � ) is an  edge of H  by deﬁnition of  isomorphism.  So w  =  f (v � ) is adjacent  to 
� 

(b)  Conclude  that  if G  and H  are  isomorphic  graphs,  then  for  each  k  ∈  N,  they  have  the  same 
Solution.  By  deﬁnition,  deg(v) =  |v�|.  Since  an  isomorphism  is  a  bijection,  a  set  and  its  image 
number of degree k  vertices. 
will be the same size (by the Mapping Rule from Week 2 Notes), so the Lemma of part (a) implies 
that  an  isomorphism,  f , maps degree  k  vertices  to degree  k  vertices.  This means  that  the  image 
under f  of the set of degree k  vertices of G  is precisely the set of degree k  vertices of H .  So by the 
� 
Mapping Rule again, there are the same number of degree k  vertices in G  and H . 

Problem  2.  For  each of  the  following pairs of graphs,  either deﬁne  an  isomomorphism between 
them, or prove that there is none.  (We write ab  as shorthand for a—b.)

(a) 

Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 4, Fri. 

G1  with V1  =  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ,  E1  =  {12, 23, 34, 14, 15, 35, 45}
G2  with V2  =  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ,  E2  =  {12, 23, 34, 45, 51, 24, 25} 
Solution.  Not isomorphic: G2  has a node, 2, of degree 4, but the maximum degree in G1  is 3.  � 

(b) 

G1  with V1  =  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} ,  E1  =  {12, 23, 34, 14, 45, 56, 26}
G2  with V2  =  {a,  b,  c, d,  e, f } ,  E2  =  {ab,  bc,   cd, de, ae,  ef , cf } 

Solution.  Isomorphic with the vertex correspondence:  1f , 2c,   3d, 4e,  5a,  6b 

� 

(c) 

G1  with V1  =  {a,  b,  c, d,  e, f , g , h} ,  E1  =  {ab,  bc,   cd, ad,   ef , f g , gh,  he, dh,  bf }
G2  with V2  =  {s,  t,  u,  v , w, x,  y , z} ,  E2  =  {st,  tu, uv , sv , wx,   xy , yz , wz , sw, vz} 

Solution.  Not  isomorphic:  they  have  the  same  number  of  vertices,  edges,  and  set  of  vertex  de­
grees.  But the degree 2 vertices of G1  are all adjacent to two degree 3 vertices, while the degree 2 
� 
vertices of G2  are all adjacent to one degree 2 vertex and one degree 3 vertex. 

Problem 3.  Extra Problem. 

(a)  Exhibit three nonisomorphic, connected graphs with ﬁve vertices and four edges. 

(b)  Argue that every connected graph with ﬁve vertices and four edges  is  isomomorphic to one 
of the three in part (a).
