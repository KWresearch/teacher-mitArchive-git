Problem  1.  This  problem  gives  you  practice  with  modular  arithmetic.  If  you  wish  to  shout 
“Woohoo!”, go ahead— we understand. 
(a)  Prove:  If a  ≡ b  (mod  n), then ac  ≡ bc  (mod  n). 
Solution.  The condition a  ≡ b  (mod  n) is equivalent to the assertion n 
|
(a  − b).  This implies that 
(ac   − bc). This is equivalent to ac   ≡ bc  (mod  n).  �
(a  − b)c  by part (a) of Problem 1, and so n

| 
n 

(b)  Prove:  (a  rem n) ≡ a  (mod  n) 
Solution.  The remainder a  rem n  is equal to a − qn   for some integer q . However, for every integer 
q : 

n  | qn  
⇒  n 
(a  − qn) − a 
| 
(a  rem n) − a 
⇒  n  |
The last statement is equivalent to (a   rem n) ≡ a  (mod  n).

(c)  Sketch  an  induction  proof  that  10k  ≡  1  (mod  9)  for  all  k  ≥  0.  Why  is  a  number written  in 
decimal evenly divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9? 
Solution.  The  claim  holds  for  k  = 0,  since  100  ≡  1  (mod  9).  Suppose  the  claim  holds  for  some 
k  ≥  0;  that  is,  10k  ≡  1  (mod  9).  Multiplying both sides by 10 gives 10k+1  ≡  10  ≡  1  (mod  9).  So 
the claim holds for k   +  1 as well. 
A number in decimal has the form: 

dk  · 10k  +  dk−1  10k−1  +  .  .   .  +  d1  10  +  d0
·
· 
From the observation above, we know: 

·
· 
·
dk  10k  +  dk−1  10k−1  +  .  .  .  +  d1  10  +  d0 

≡ 

dk  +  dk−1  +  .  .   .  +  d1  +  d0 

(mod  9)

This shows something stronger:  the remainder when the original number is divided by 9 is equal 
to the remainder when the sum of the digits is divided by 9.  In particular, if one is zero, then so is 
� 
the other. 

Problem 2.  Two nonparallel  lines  in  the real plane  intersect at a point.  Algebraically,  this means 
that the equations 

y  =  m1x  +  b1 
y  =  m2x  +  b2 
have a unique solution (x,  y), provided m1  =� m2 .  This statement would be false if we restricted x 
and y  to the integers, since the two lines could cross at a noninteger point: 

However,  an  analogous  statement  holds  if  we  work  over  the  integers  modulo  a  prime  p.  Find  a 
solution to the congruences 

y  ≡  m1x  +  b1 
(mod  p) 
y  ≡  m2x  +  b2 
(mod  p) 
of  the  form x  ≡?  (mod  p) and y  ≡?  (mod  p) where  the ?’s denote expressions  involving m1 , m2 , 
b1 , and b2 . You may ﬁnd it helpful to solve the original equations over the reals ﬁrst. 

Solution.  Subtracting the second congruence from the ﬁrst, we have: 

0  ≡  m1x  +  b1  − (m2x  +  b2 ) 
(m1  − m2 )x
≡ 
b2  − b1 
(mod  p)
x  ≡  (m1  − m2 )−1  · (b2  − b1 ) 

(mod  p) 

(mod  p) 

Substituting this value of x  into the ﬁrst congruence, we have 

y  ≡  m1  · (m1  − m2 )−1  · (b2  − b1 ) +  b1 

(mod  p)

Problem 3.  Suppose that p  is a prime.

(a)  An integer k  is self­inverse if k k  ≡ 1  (mod  p).  Find all integers that are self­inverse mod p.
·
Solution.  The congruence holds if and only if p  | k2  − 1  which is equivalent to p 
(k  +  1)(k  − 1). 
|
This holds if and only if either p k  +  1  or p k   − 1. Thus, k  ≡ ±1  (mod  p).

(b)  Wilson’s Theorem says that (p − 1)!  ≡ −1  (mod  p). The English mathematician Edward Waring 
said that this statement would probably be extremely difﬁcult to prove because no one had even 
devised  an  adequate  notation  for  dealing with  primes.  (Gauss  proved  it while  standing.)  Your 
turn! Try cancelling terms of (p   − 1)!  in pairs.  See if you can do it while standing on one leg. 
Solution.  If p  = 2, then the theorem holds, because 1!  ≡ −1  (mod  2).  If p >  2, then p − 1 and 1 are 
distinct terms in the product 1 2 · · · · (p  − 1), and these are the only self­inverses.  Consequently, 
·
we  can  pair  each  of  the  remaining  terms  with  its multiplicative  inverse.  Since  the  product  of  a 
number and its inverse is congruent to 1, all of these remaining terms cancel. Therefore, we have: 

(p  − 1)! 

1 · (p  − 1) 
≡ 
(mod  p)
≡  −1 
(mod  p)
