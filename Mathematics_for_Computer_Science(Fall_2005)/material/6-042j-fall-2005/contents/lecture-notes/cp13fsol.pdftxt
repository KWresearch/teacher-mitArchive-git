Problem 1.  A couple decides  to have children until  they have both a boy and a girl.  What  is  the 
expected number of children that they’ll end up with?  Assume that each child is equally likely to 
be a boy or a girl and genders are mutually independent. 

Solution.  There are many ways to solve this problem. We’ll do it from ﬁrst principles. 
Suppose that a couple has children until they have both a boy and a girl.  A tree diagram for this 
experiment is shown below. 

E [R] = 

Let  the  random  variable  R  be  the  number  of  children  the  couple  has.  From  the  deﬁnition  of

The only difﬁculty is evaluating the sum. We can use the general formula 
1
(1 − r)
2
which is obtained by differentiating the formula for the sum of an inﬁnite geometric series. Setting 
r = 1/2 gives: 

1 + 2r + 3r 2  + 4r 3  + . . .  =

We have to tweak this a little to get the sum we’re interested in.  Subtracting 1 from each side and 
then dividing both sides by 2 does the trick:

A much simpler approach uses the fact that the “mean time to failure” is 1/p where p is the prob­
ability of failure in one step.  If we consider having a child of opposite sex to the ﬁrst a “failure” of 
that child, then the mean time to failure is the expected number of children after the ﬁrst until the 
couple has both  a boy  and a girl.  But  the probability of a  failure at  the kth  child after  the ﬁrst  is 
1/2 for all k ≥ 1. So the expected number of children after the ﬁrst is 1/(1/2) = 2, and the expected 
� 
number of children including the ﬁrst is 1+2 =3. 

Problem  2.  There  is  a  nice  formula  for  the  expected  value  of  a  random  variable R that  takes  on

Suppose  we  roll  6  fair,  independent  dice.  Let  R  be  the  largest  number  that  comes  up.  Use  the 
formula above to compute E [R]. 
Solution.  The ﬁrst  task  is  to  compute Pr {R > k};  that  is,  the probability  that  some die  is greater 
than k . Let’s switch to computing the probability of the complementary event: 
Pr {R > k} = 1 − Pr {R ≤ k} 
Now  Pr {R ≤ k}  is  the  probability  that  all  the  dice  show  numbers  in  the  set  {1, . . . k}.  If  k  ≥  6, 
then this probability is 1.  For smaller k , the probability that one die shows a value in this range is 
k/6.  Since the dice are independent, the probability that all 6 dice are in this range is (k/6)6 . Thus,

Problem 3.  A classroom has sixteen desks arranged as shown below. 

If  there  is  a  girl  in  front,  behind,  to  the  left,  or  to  the  right  of  a  boy,  then  the  two  of  them  ﬂirt. 
One  student may  be  in multiple  ﬂirting  couples;  for  example,  a  student  in  a  corner  of  the  class­
room can ﬂirt with up  to  two others, while a  student  in  the center can ﬂirt with as many as  four 
others.  Suppose  that  desks  are  occupied  by  boys  and  girls with  equal  probability  and mutually 
independently. What is the expected number of ﬂirting couples?

Solution.  First, let’s count the number of pairs of adjacent desks. There are three in each row and 
three in each column.  Since there are four rows and four columns, there are 3 · 4 + 3 · 4 = 24 pairs 
of adjacent desks. 
Number  these  pairs  of  adjacent  desks  from  1  to  24.  Let  Fi  be  an  indicator  for  the  event  that 
� 
� 
occupants of the desks in the i­th pair are ﬂirting. The probability we want is then: 
24� 
24� 
E [Fi ] 
Fi  = 
E 
24� 
i=1 
i=1 
Pr {Fi  = 1} 
i=1 

= 

The ﬁrst step uses linearity of expectation, and the second uses the fact that the expectation of an 
indicator is equal to the probability that it is 1. 
The  occupants  of  adjacent  desks  are  ﬂirting  if  the  ﬁrst  holds  a  girl  and  the  second  a  boy  or  vice 
versa.  Each of these events happens with probability 1/2 · 1/2 =  1/4, and so the probability that 
the occupants ﬂirt is
