Combinatorial proofs of identities 
Recall the basic plan for a combinatorial proof of an identity x  =  y : 

1.  Deﬁne a set S . 
2.  Show that |S | =  x  by counting one way. 
3.  Show that |S | =  y  by counting another way. 
4.  Conclude that x  =  y . 

Problem  3.  You  want  to  choose  a  team  of  m  people  from  a  pool  of  n  people  for  your  startup 
�  ��  � 
company,  and  from  these  m  people  you  want  to  choose  k  to  be  the  team  managers.  You  took 
6.042, so you know you can do this in

ways. But your CFO, who went to Harvard Business School, comes up with the formula 
n   − k 
n
k m  − k 
. 

Before doing the reasonable thing —dump on your CFO or Harvard Business School— you decide 
to check his answer against yours. 

(a)  Start by giving an algebraic proof  that your CFO’s formula agrees with yours. 

(b)  Now give a combinatorial argument proving this same fact.

Learning to count takes practice! The following problems offer some. 

Problem 5.  A pizza house is having a promotional sale. Their commercial reads: 

We  offer  9  different  toppings  for  your  pizza!  Buy  3  large  pizzas  at  the  regular  price, 
and you can get each one with as many different toppings as you wish, absolutely free. 
That’s 22,  369,   621  different ways to choose your pizzas! 

The ad writer was a former Harvard student who had evaluated the formula (29 )3/3!   on his calcu­
lator and gotten close to 22,  369,   621. Unfortunately, (29 )3/3!   is obviously not an integer, so clearly 
something  is  wrong.  What  mistaken  reasoning  might  have  led  the  ad  writer  to  this  formula? 
Explain how to ﬁx the mistake and get a correct formula. 

Problem 6.  (a)  In how many different ways can Blockbuster arrange 64 copies of 13 conversations 
about one thing, 96 copies of L’Auberge Espagnole and 1 copy of Matrix Revolutions on a shelf? What 
if they are to be arranged in 5 shelves? 

(b)  Set A  has r  elements and set B  has n  elements.  How many functions are there from A  to B ? 
How many of them are injective (one­to­one)? How many of them are bijective? 

(c)  Find the number of 5­card hands in which every suit appears at most twice. 

(d)  How many paths are there from point (0,  0)  to (50,  50)  if every step increments one coordinate 
and  leaves  the  other  unchanged?  if  there  are  impassable  boulders  sitting  at  points  (10,  10)  and 
(20,  20)?  Hint:  Count  the  number  of  paths  going  through  (10,  10),  the  number  through  (20,   20), 
and use Inclusion­Exclusion.
