Problem  1.  Given  a  simple  graph  G,  we  apply  the  following  operation  to  the  graph:  pick  two 
vertices u = v such that either 

1.  there  is  an  edge  of G between  u  and  v  and  there  is  also  a  path  from  u  to  v  which  does  not 
include this edge; in this case, delete the edge {u, v}. 
2.  or, there is no path from u to v ; in which case, add the edge {u, v}. 
We  keep  repeating  these  operations  until  it  is  no  longer  possible  to  ﬁnd  two  vertices  u  =�
which an operation applies. 
Assume the vertices of G are the integers 1, 2, . . . , n for some n  ≥  2.  This procedure can be mod­
elled as a state machine whose states are all possible simple graphs with vertices 1, 2, . . . , n.  The 
start state is G, and the ﬁnal states are the graphs on which no operation is possible. 

v  to 

(a)  Let G be the graph with vertices {1, 2, 3, 4} and edges 
, 2} , {3
{{1
, 4}} 

What are the possible ﬁnal states reachable from start state G? Draw them. 
(b)  For any state, G� , let e be the number of edges in G� , c be the number of connected components 
it has, and s be the number of simple cycles.  For each of the derived variables below, indicate the 
strongest  of  the  properties  that  it  is  guaranteed  to  satisfy,  no  matter  what  the  starting  graph  G 
is.  The  choices  for properties  are:  constant,  strictly  increasing,  strictly  decreasing,  weakly  increasing, 
weakly decreasing, none of these. The derived variables are 
(i)  e − s 
(ii)  c + e 
(iii)  3c + 2e 
(iv)  c + s 
(v)  (c, e), partially ordered coordinatewise (the product partial order). 

(c)  Choose  a  derived  variable  from  above  and  prove  that  it  is  strictly  decreasing  in  some well­
founded partial order. Conclude that the procedure terminates. 

(d)  Prove that any ﬁnal state must be a tree on the vertices.

Problem.  See  if you can  come up with a  stable marriage assignment given  the  following prefer­
ences.  You are not expected to know/remember the Dating Protocol that solves this problem and 
which  is about  to be covered  in  lecture.  (And  if you do  remember  the protocol, don’t  spoil your 
teammates’ fun by telling them.)

(a)  Use the Mating Algorithm to ﬁnd two stable assignments of Students to Companies. 

Problem 3.  Prove that the Mating Algorithm produces stable marriages.  (Don’t look up the proof 
in the Course Notes.)
