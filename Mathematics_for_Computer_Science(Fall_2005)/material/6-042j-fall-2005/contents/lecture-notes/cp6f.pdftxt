Problem  1.  This  problem  gives  you  practice  with  modular  arithmetic.  If  you  wish  to  shout 
“Woohoo!”, go ahead— we understand. 

(a)  Prove:  If a  ≡ b  (mod  n), then ac  ≡ bc  (mod  n). 

(b)  Prove:  (a  rem n) ≡ a  (mod  n) 

(c)  Sketch  an  induction  proof  that  10k  ≡  1  (mod  9)  for  all  k  ≥  0.  Why  is  a  number written  in 
decimal evenly divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9? 

Problem 2.  Two nonparallel  lines  in  the real plane  intersect at a point.  Algebraically,  this means 
that the equations 

y  =  m1x  +  b1 
y  =  m2x  +  b2 
have a unique solution (x,  y), provided m1  =� m2 .  This statement would be false if we restricted x 
and y  to the integers, since the two lines could cross at a noninteger point:

However,  an  analogous  statement  holds  if  we  work  over  the  integers  modulo  a  prime  p.  Find  a 
solution to the congruences 

y  ≡  m1x  +  b1 
(mod  p) 
y  ≡  m2x  +  b2 
(mod  p) 
of  the  form x  ≡?  (mod  p) and y  ≡?  (mod  p) where  the ?’s denote expressions  involving m1 , m2 , 
b1 , and b2 . You may ﬁnd it helpful to solve the original equations over the reals ﬁrst.

Problem 3.  Suppose that p  is a prime.

(a)  An integer k  is self­inverse if k k  ≡ 1  (mod  p).  Find all integers that are self­inverse mod p.

(b)  Wilson’s Theorem says that (p − 1)!  ≡ −1  (mod  p). The English mathematician Edward Waring 
said that this statement would probably be extremely difﬁcult to prove because no one had even 
devised  an  adequate  notation  for  dealing with  primes.  (Gauss  proved  it while  standing.)  Your 
turn! Try cancelling terms of (p   − 1)!  in pairs.  See if you can do it while standing on one leg.
