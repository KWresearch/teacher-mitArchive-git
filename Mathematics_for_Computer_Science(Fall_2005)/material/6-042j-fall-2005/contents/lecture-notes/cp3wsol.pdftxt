for all n ≥ 1. 
Remember to formally 

1.  Declare proof by induction. 
2.  Identify the induction hypothesis P (n). 

3.  Establish the base case. 
4.  Prove that P (n) ⇒ P (n +  1). 
5.  Conclude that P (n) holds for all n ≥ 1. 

as in the ﬁve part template. 

Solution.  We proceed by induction. The induction hypothesis, P (n), will be the equation (1).

Base case:  First, we must show that P (1)  is true. This is immediate, since:

� 
1(1  +  1)  �2 
2 
Inductive step: Next, we must show that P (n) implies P (n + 1)  for all n ≥ 1. Assuming that P (n) 
is true, we can reason as follows: 
� 
n(n +  1)  �2 
(n +  1)(n +  2)  �2 
� 
+  (n +  1)3
2 
2 

13  +  23  +  . . . +  n 3  +  (n +  1)3  = 

13  = 

= 

The ﬁrst step uses the assumption P (n), and the second uses only algebra. This shows that P (n+1) 
is true. Therefore, P (n) is true for all n ≥ 1  by induction.

Problem 2.  (a)  Prove by induction that a 2n  ×2n  courtyard with a 1×1 statue of Bill in any position 
can be covered with L­shaped tiles. 
Solution.  Let P (n) be the proposition that for every  location of Bill  in a 2n  × 2n  courtyard,  there 
exists a tiling of the remainder. 
Base case: P (0)  is true because Bill ﬁlls the whole courtyard. 
Inductive  step:  Asume  that  P (n)  is  true  for  some  n  ≥  0;  that  is,  for  every  location  of  Bill  in  a 
2n  × 2n  courtyard, there exists a tiling of the remainder. Divide the 2n+1  × 2n+1  courtyard into four 
quadrants, each 2n  × 2n .  One quadrant contains Bill (B in the diagram below).  Place a temporary 
Bill (X in the diagram) in each of the three central squares lying outside this quadrant: 

2n 

2n 

B

X 
X  X 

2n 

2n 

Now  we  can  tile  each  of  the  four  quadrants  by  the  induction  assumption.  Replacing  the  three 
temporary Bills with a single L­shaped tile completes the job. This proves that P (n) implies P (n + 
1)   for all n  ≥ 0. The theorem follows as a special case. 
This  proof  has  two  nice  properties.  First,  not  only  does  the  argument  guarantee  that  a  tiling 
exists, but also it gives a recursive procedure for ﬁnding such a tiling.  Second, we have a stronger 
result:  if  Bill  wanted  a  statue  on  the  edge  of  the  courtyard,  away  from  the  pigeons,  we  could 
� 
accommodate him! 

(b)  (Discussion Question) In part (a) we saw that it can be easier to prove a stronger theorem. Does 
this surprise you? How would you explain this phenomenon? 

Solution.  It might  seem  that  it  ought  to  be  harder  to  prove  a more  general  theorem  than  a  less 
general  one,  but  sometimes  not.  For  example,  the  more  general  result  might  actually  be  easier 
because it involves fewer assumptions, and this can help in avoiding the complications of unnece­
sary hypotheses. 
But for an induction proof in particular, using a more general induction hypothesis means we can 
make a stronger assumption in the induction step (namely, we can assume a stronger P (n)), which 
� 
can make it easier to prove the conclusion of the induction step (namely, P (n  +  1)).
