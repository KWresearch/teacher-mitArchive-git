Problem 1.  A bipartite graph is regular if every vertex on the left has the same degree, c, and every 
vertex on the right has the same degree, d. 

(a)  Prove the following: 
Corollary.  A regular bipartite graph has a matching for the vertices on the left iff c   ≥ d >  0. 
Hint:  Consider  the set of edges between any set, L, on  the  left and  its set of neighbors, N (L), on 
the right. 
Solution.  We ﬁrst show that if c  ≥ d >  0, then for every set of vertices, L, on the left 
L ≤ N (L). 
|
| 
Hall’s Theorem will then imply that there is a matching.

To prove (1), let F  be the set of edges incident to some set L  on the left. Now |F is the sum of the

|
degrees of the vertices of L, so 
F =  c  |L| .
|
| 
On the other hand, F   is a subset of the edges incident to N (L), so 
|
| ≤ d |
N (L)| .

Hence,

since d/c  ≤ 1. This proves (1). 

Conversely, suppose c  <  d.  Consider the previous argument where L  is the set of all left vertices.

Now the set of edges incident to N (L) actually is the same as the edges incident to L, so

L =  d  · |N (L) ,
c  · |
| 
| 

and therefore 

· |N (L) > N (L) .

L =

So L  violates the condition of Hall’s Theorem necessary for a matching, and no matching is possi­

(b)  Conclude that the Magician could pull off the Card Trick with a deck of 124 cards. 
Solution.  By the ﬁrst part, the Magician can determine the 5th card as long as the degree of each 
hand  is  at most  the degree  of  each  sequence  of  4.  Whatever  the  size  of deck,  the degree  of  each 
hand  is 5!  =  120.  The degree of each sequence of 4 will be  the number of cards remaining  in  the 
deck.  With  a deck of  124,  there will be  120  cards  remaining,  so  the degree of  each  sequence of  4 
will still be leq   the degree of each hand. 
Note that by part (a), the trick could not be done with any deck larger than 124.

Problem  2.  We  have  just  demonstrated  how  to  determine  the  5th  card  in  a  poker  hand when  a 
collaborator reveals the other 4 cards.  Describe a similar method for determining 2 hidden cards 
in a hand of 9 cards when your collaborator reveals the other 7 cards. 
Solution.  Since there must be �9/4� = 3 cards with the same suit, our collaborator chooses to hide 
two of them and then use the third one as the ﬁrst card to be revealed.  So this ﬁrst revealed card 
ﬁxes the suit of the two hidden cards; it will also be used as the origin for the offset position of the 
ﬁrst hidden card. This ﬁrst hidden card will in turn be used as the origin for the offset of the other 
hidden card.  There are six cards to code the two offset positions.  These sufﬁce to code two offsets 
of  size  from  one  to  six.  That  is,  our  collaborator  can  choose  one  of  the  3!   = 6  orders  in  which 
to  reveal  the ﬁrst  three  cards  and  thereby  tell us  the offset position of  the ﬁrst hidden  card.  Our 
collaborator can then choose the order of the ﬁnal three cards to describe the offset position of the 
second hidden  card  from  the ﬁrst.  Note  that  the ﬁrst  revealed  card must  be  chosen  so  that  both 
offsets are less ≤  6; since the sum of the offsets between successive cards ordered in a cycle from 
Ace  to King  is  13,  it  is  not  possible  for more  than  one  offset  between  successive  cards  to  exceed 
� 
seven, so this is always possible. 

Problem 3.  The Tao of BOOKKEEPER: we seek enlightenment through contemplation of the word

Problem 4.  Solve the following counting problems.  Deﬁne an appropriate mapping (bijective or 
k­to­1) between a set whose size you know and the set in question. 

(a)  How many different ways are there to select a dozen donuts if four varieties are available? 

Solution.  There  is a bijection  from  selections of a dozen donuts  to 15­bit  sequences with exactly 
3  ones.  In particular,  suppose  that  the varieties  are  glazed,  chocolate,  lemon,  and Boston  creme. 
Then a selection of g  glazed, c  chocolate, l  lemon, and b   Boston creme maps to the sequence: 
(g  0�s) 1 (c  0�s) 1 (l  0�s) 1  (b  0�s)

(b)  How many  paths  are  there  from  (0, 0)  to  (10, 20)  consisting  of  right­steps  (which  increment 
the ﬁrst coordinate) and up­steps (which increment the second coordinate)? 
� � 
Solution.  There  is  a  bijection  from  30­bit  sequences  with  10  zeros  and  20  ones.  The  sequence 
(b1 , . . . , b30 ) maps  to  a path where  the  i­th  step  is  right  if  bi  = 0  and up  if  bi  = 1.  Therefore,  the

number of paths is equal to  30   .

(c)  An independent living group is hosting nine new candidates for membership. Each candidate 
must be assigned a task:  1 must wash pots, 2 must clean the kitchen, 3 must clean the bathrooms, 
1 must clean the common area, and 2 must serve dinner.  In how many ways this be done? 
Solution.  There  is  a  bijection  from  sequences  containing  one  P ’s,  two  K ’s,  three  B ’s,  a  C ,  and 
two D’s.  In any such sequence,  the  letter  in  the  ith position speciﬁes  the  task assigned  to  the  ith 
candidate. Therefore, the number of possible assignments is: 
8! 

1!   2!  3!   1!  2!

(d)  In  how many ways  can Mr.  and Mrs.  Grumperson  distribute  13  identical  pieces  of  coal  to 
their two— no, three!— children for Christmas? 
� � 
Solution.  There  is  a  bijection  from  15­bit  strings  with  two  ones.  In  particular,  the  bit  string 
0a10b10c  maps  to  the  assignment  of  a  coals  to  the  ﬁrst  child,  b  coals  to  the  second,  and  c  coals 
�
to the third. Therefore, there are  15  assignments.

(e)  How many solutions over the natural numbers are there to the equation:

� 
�
Solution.  There is a bijection from 110­bit sequences with 10 ones to solutions to this equation.  In 
particular, xi  is the number of zeros before the i­th one but after the (i − 1)­st one (or the beginning 
�
of the sequence). Therefore, there are  110  solutions.
