Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 8, Wed. 


Problem  1.  We  begin  with  two  large  glasses.  The  ﬁrst  glass  contains  a  pint  of  water,  and  the 
second contains a pint of wine.  We pour 1/3 of a pint from the ﬁrst glass into the second, stir up 
the wine/water mixture in the second glass, and then pour 1/3 of a pint of the mix back into the 
ﬁrst glass and repeat this pouring back­and­forth process a total of n times. 

(a)  Describe a closed form formula for the amount of wine in the ﬁrst glass after n back­and­forth 
pourings. 

Solution.  The state of  the system of glasses/wine/water at  the beginning of a round of pouring 
and  pouring  back  is  determined  by  the  total  amount  of  wine  in  the  ﬁrst  glass.  Suppose  at  the 
beginning of  some  round,  the ﬁrst glass  contains w  pints of wine,  0  ≤  w  ≤  1 and 1 − w  pints of 
water. The second glass contains the rest of the wine and water. 
Pouring 1/3 pint from ﬁrst glass to second leaves 2/3 pints of liquid and (2/3)w wine in the ﬁrst 
glass, and 4/3 pints of liquid and 1 − (2/3)w wine in the second glass. Pouring 1/3 pint back from 
second into ﬁrst transfers a proportion of (1/3)/(4/3) of the wine in the second glass into the ﬁrst. 
So the round completes with both glasses containing a pint of liquid, and the ﬁrst glass containing 
(2/3)w + (1/4)(1 − (2/3)w) = 1/4 + w/2 

pints of wine. After one more round, the ﬁrst glass contains 

1/4 + (1/4 + w/2)/2 = 1/4 + 1/8 + w/22 

pints of wine, and after n more rounds 

i=1 (1/2)i+1  = w/2n  + (1/2)Σi
w/2n  + Σn
=1 (1/2)i 
n 
= w/2n  + (1/2)(−1 + Σn
i=0 (1/2)i ) 
= w/2n  + (1/2)(−1 + (1 − (1/2)n+1 )/(1 − 1/2)) 
= w/2n  − 1/2 + 1 − (1/2)n+1 
= w/2n  + 1/2 − (1/2)n+1 . 

Since w = 0 initially, the pints of wine in the ﬁrst glass after n rounds is 
1/2 − (1/2)n+1 .

(b)  What is the limit of the amount of wine in each glass as n approaches inﬁnity? 

Solution.  The  limiting  amount  of  wine  in  the  ﬁrst  glass  approaches  1/2  from  below  as  n  ap­
proaches inﬁnity.  In fact, it approaches 1/2 no matter how the wine was initially distributed. This 
of course is what you would expect: after a thorough mixing the glasses should contain essentially 
� 
the same amount of wine. 

Problem 2.  Suppose you were about to enter college today and a college loan ofﬁcer offered you 
the  following deal:  $25,000 at  the  start of each year  for  four years  to pay  for your  college  tuition 
and an option of choosing one of the following repayment plans: 

Plan A:  Wait four years, then repay $20,000 at the start of each year for the next ten years. 

Plan B:  Wait ﬁve years, then repay $30,000 at the start of each year for the next ﬁve years. 

Suppose the annual interest rate paid by banks is 7% and does not change in the future. 

(a)  Assuming  that  it’s no hardship  for you  to meet  the  terms of either payback plan, which one 
is a better deal?  (You will need a calculator.) 

Solution.  $1  today will  be  worth  $1.07  next  year,  and  $1.072  the  year  after,  etc.  So  set  r  =
