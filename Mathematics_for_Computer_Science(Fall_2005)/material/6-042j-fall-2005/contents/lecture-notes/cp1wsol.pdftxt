Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 1, Wed. 

Problem 1.  Identify exactly where the bugs are in each of the following bogus proofs.1 

(a)  1/8 > 1/4. 

Bogus proof. 

3 > 2 
3 log10 (1/2) > 2 log10 (1/2) 
log10 (1/2)3  > log10 (1/2)2 
(1/2)3  > (1/2)2 , 

and the claim now follows by the rules for multiplying fractions. 

Solution.  log x <  0,  for  0  < x <  1,  so  since  both  sides  of  the  inequality  “3  >  2”  are  being 
multiplied by the negative quantity log10 (1/2), the “>” in the second line should have been “<.”

(b)  1¢ = $0.01 = ($0.1)2  = (10¢)2  = 100¢ = $1. 
Solution.  $0.01  =  $(0.1)2  =�
($0.1)2  because  the  units  $2  and  $  don’t  match  (just  as  in  physics 
the  difference  between  sec2  and  sec  indicates  the  difference  between  acceleration  and  velocity).

Similarly, (10¢)2  = 100
¢. 

Problem 2.

Proposition (Arithmetic­Geometric Mean Inequality).  For all nonnegative real numbers a and b

a + b  √
≥ 
2 

ab.

What is wrong with the following proof of this proposition?

The last statement is true because a − b is a real number, and the square of a real number is never 
negative. This proves the claim. 

Solution.  In  this  argument,  we  started with what we wanted  to  prove  and  then  reasoned  until 
we reached a statement that is surely true.  The little question marks presumably are supposed to 
indicate  that we’re  not  quite  certain  that  the  inequalities  are  valid  until we  get  down  to  the  last 
that  if  (a + b)/2  ≥ √
step.  At that step, the inequality checks out, but that doesn’t prove the claim.  All we have proved is 
ab,  then  (a − b)2  ≥  0, which  is not very  interesting,  since we already knew 
that the square of any nonnegative number is nonnegative. 

To  be  fair,  this  bogus  proof  is  pretty  good:  if  it  was  written  in  reverse  order  –  or  if  “is  implied 
by” was simply inserted after each line – it would actually prove the Arithmetic­Geometric Mean 
Inequality: 

Proof.

a 2  + 2ab + b2  ≥ 4ab, 
a 2  − 2ab + b2  ≥ 0, 
(a − b)2  ≥ 0. 

is implied by 

which is implied by 
which is implied by 
which is implied by 

The last statement is true because a − b is a real number, and the square of a real number is never 
negative. This proves the claim. 

But  the problem with  the bogus proof as written  is  that  it  reasons backward, beginning with  the 
proposition in question and reasoning to a true conclusion.  This kind of backward reasoning can 
easily “prove” false statements. Here’s an example: 

False Claim. 

0 = 1.

Bogus proof. 

0  ?= 1 
1  ?= 0 
0 + 1  ?= 1 + 0 
1 = 1 

and the last equality is trivially true. 

We can also come up with very easy “proofs” of true theorems, for example, here’s an easy “proof ” 
of the Arithmetic­Geometric Mean Inequality: 

Bogus proof. 

a + b  √

So watch out for backward proofs!
