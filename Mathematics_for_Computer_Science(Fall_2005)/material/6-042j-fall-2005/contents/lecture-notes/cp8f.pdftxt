Problem 1.  There is a bug on the edge of a 1­meter rug. The bug wants to cross to the other side of 
the rug.  It crawls at 1 cm per second. However, at the end of each second, a malicious ﬁrst­grader 
named Mildred Anderson  stretches  the  rug  by  1 meter.  Assume  that  her  action  is  instantaneous 
and the rug stretches uniformly. Thus, here’s what happens in the ﬁrst few seconds: 

•	 The bug walks 1 cm in the ﬁrst second, so 99 cm remain ahead. 

•	 Mildred stretches the rug by 1 meter, which doubles its length. So now there are 2 cm behind 
the bug and 198 cm ahead. 

•	 The bug walks another 1 cm in the next second, leaving 3 cm behind and 197 cm ahead. 
•	 Then  Mildred  strikes,  stretching  the  rug  from  2  meters  to  3  meters.  So  there  are  now  3  · 
(3/2) = 4.5 cm behind the bug and 197 · (3/2) = 295.5 cm ahead. 
•	 The bug walks another 1 cm in the third second, and so on. 

Your job is to determine this poor bug’s fate. 

(a)  During second i, what fraction of the rug does the bug cross? 

(b)  Over the ﬁrst n seconds, what fraction of the rug does the bug cross altogether? Express your 
answer in terms of the Harmonic number Hn . 

(c)  Approximately how many seconds does the bug need to cross the entire rug? 

Problem 2.  Using the method described in lecture, a truck can travel across any size desert if there 
is  a  large  enough  supply  of  gas  at  the  border  of  the  desert.  Show  that  if  there  is  a  large  enough 
supply of gas at the border, a truck can also make a round trip across any size desert.

Problem  3.  There  is  a  number  a such  that  ∞
i=1 
Prove it. 

ip  converges  iff  p < a.  What  is  the  value  of  a?
