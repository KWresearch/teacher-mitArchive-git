The Four­Step Method 

This  is  a  good  approach  to  questions  of  the  form,  “What  is  the  probability  that ——­?” 
Intuition will mislead you, but this formal approach gives the right answer every time. 

1.  Find the sample space.  (Use a tree diagram.) 

2.  Deﬁne events of interest.  (Mark leaves corresponding to these events.) 

3.  Determine outcome probabilities: 

(a)  Assign edge probabilities. 
(b)  Compute outcome probabilities.  (Multiply along root­to­leaf paths.) 

4.  Compute event probabilities.  (Sum the probabilities of all outcomes in the event.) 

Problem 1.  [A Baseball Series] The New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox are play­
ing  a  two­out­of­three  series.  (In  other  words,  they  play  until  one  team  has  won  two 
games.  Then that team  is declared the overall winner and the series ends.)  Assume that 
the Red Sox win each game with probability 3/5, regardless of the outcomes of previous 
games. 
Answer the questions below using the four­step method.  You can use the same tree dia­
gram for all three problems. 

(a)  What is the probability that a total of 3 games are played? 

(b)  What is the probability that the winner of the series loses the ﬁrst game? 

(c)  What is the probability that the correct team wins the series?

Problem 2.  [The Four­Door Deal] Suppose  that Let’s Make a Deal  is played according  to 
different  rules.  Now  there are  four doors, with a prize hidden behind one of  them.  The 
contestant is allowed to pick a door. The host must then reveal a different door that has no 
prize behind it.  The contestant is allowed to stay with his or her original door or to pick 
one of the other two that are still closed.  If the contestant chooses the door concealing the 
prize in this second stage, then he or she wins. 

(a)  Contestant Stu, a sanitation engineer from Trenton, New Jersey, stays with his origi­
nal door. What is the probability that he wins the prize? 
The  tree diagram  is  awkwardly  large.  This  often  happens;  in  fact,  sometimes  you’ll  en­
counter inﬁnite tree diagrams! Try to draw enough of the diagram so that you understand 
the structure of the remainder. 

(b)  Contestant Zelda, an alien abduction researcher from Helena, Montana, switches  to 
one of  the  remaining  two doors with  equal probability.  What  is  the probability  that  she 
wins the prize? 

Problem 3.  [Simulating a fair coin] Suppose you need a fair coin to decide which door to 
choose in the 6.042 Monty Hall game.  After making everyone in your group empty their 
pockets, all you managed to turn up is some crumpled bubble gum wrappers, a few used 
tissues,  and one penny.  However,  the penny was  from Prof.  Rubinfeld’s pocket,  so  it  is 
not safe to assume that it is a fair coin. 
How can we use a coin of unknown bias to get the same effect as a fair coin of bias 1/2? 
Draw the tree diagram for your solution, but since it is inﬁnite, draw only enough to see 
a pattern. 
Suggestion:  A neat  trick allows you  to  sum all  the outcome probabilities  that  cause you 
to say ”Heads”:  Let s  be the sum of all ”Heads” outcome probabilities in the whole tree. 
Notice that you can write the sum of all the ”Heads” outcome probabilities in certain subtrees as 
a function of s. Use this observation to write an equation in s  and then solve.
