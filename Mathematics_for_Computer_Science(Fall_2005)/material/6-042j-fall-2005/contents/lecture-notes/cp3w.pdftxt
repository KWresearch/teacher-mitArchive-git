for all n ≥ 1. 
Remember to formally 

1.  Declare proof by induction. 

2.  Identify the induction hypothesis P (n). 

3.  Establish the base case. 
4.  Prove that P (n) ⇒ P (n + 1). 
5.  Conclude that P (n) holds for all n ≥ 1.

Problem 2.  (a)  Prove by induction that a 2n  ×2n  courtyard with a 1×1 statue of Bill in any position 
can be covered with L­shaped tiles. 

(b)  (Discussion Question) In part (a) we saw that it can be easier to prove a stronger theorem. Does 
this surprise you? How would you explain this phenomenon?
