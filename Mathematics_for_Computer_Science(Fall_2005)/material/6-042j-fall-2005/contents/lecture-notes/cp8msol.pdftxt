Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 8, Mon.


Problem  1.  Given  a  simple  graph  G,  we  apply  the  following  operation  to  the  graph:  pick  two 
vertices u =  v such that either 

1.  there  is  an  edge  of G between  u  and  v  and  there  is  also  a  path  from  u  to  v  which  does  not 
include this edge; in this case, delete the edge {u, v}. 
2.  or, there is no path from u to v ; in which case, add the edge {u, v}. 
We  keep  repeating  these  operations  until  it  is  no  longer  possible  to  ﬁnd  two  vertices  u  =�
which an operation applies. 
Assume the vertices of G are the integers 1, 2, . . . , n for some n  ≥  2.  This procedure can be mod­
elled as a state machine whose states are all possible simple graphs with vertices 1, 2, . . . , n.  The 
start state is G, and the ﬁnal states are the graphs on which no operation is possible.

(a)	 Let G be the graph with vertices {1, 2, 3, 4} and edges 
{{1, 2} , {3, 4}} 

What are the possible ﬁnal states reachable from start state G? Draw them. 

Solution.  It’s  not  possible  to  delete  any  edge.  The  procedure  can  only  add  an  edge  connecting 
exactly one of vertices 1 or 2 to exactly one of vertices 3 or 4, and then terminate.  So there are four 
� 
possible ﬁnal states 

(b)  For any state, G� , let e be the number of edges in G� , c be the number of connected components 
it has, and s be the number of simple cycles.  For each of the derived variables below, indicate the 
strongest  of  the  properties  that  it  is  guaranteed  to  satisfy,  no  matter  what  the  starting  graph  G 
is.  The  choices  for properties  are:  constant,  strictly  increasing,  strictly  decreasing,  weakly  increasing, 
weakly decreasing, none of these. The derived variables are 
(i) 	 e − s 
Solution.  weakly increasing

(c)  Choose  a  derived  variable  from  above  and  prove  that  it  is  strictly  decreasing  in  some well­
founded partial order. Conclude that the procedure terminates. 

Solution.  To show  that  the variable  (ii)  strictly decreases, note  that  the  rule  for deleting an edge 
ensures that the connectedness relation does not change, so neither does the number of connected 
components c. Meanwhile the number of edges e  decreases by one when an edge is deleted. There­
fore  the variable 3c  + 2e  decreases by 2.  The rule  for adding an edge ensures  that  the number of 
connected components c  decreases by one and the number of edges e  increases by one.  Therefore 
the variable 3c  + 2e  decreases by 1. 
To  show  that  the  variable  (iii)  strictly  decreases,  note  that  the  rule  for  deleting  an  edge  ensures 
that  the number  of  connected  components  c  does not  change  and  the number  of  simple  cycles  s 
decreases  by  n,  where  n  ≥  1.  Therefore  the  variable  c  + s  decreases  by  n.  The  rule  for  adding 
an edge ensures that the number of connected components c  decreases by one and the number of 
simple cycles s   does not change. Therefore the variable c  + s  decreases by one. 
To show that the  lexicographically ordered (c,   e) strictly decreases, note that the rule for deleting 
an  edge  ensures  that  the  number  of  connected  components  c  does  not  change  and  the  number 
of  edges  e  decreases  by  one.  The  rule  for  adding  an  edge  ensures  that  the number  of  connected 
� 
components c  decreases by one. 

(d)	 Prove that any ﬁnal state must be a tree on the vertices. 

Solution.  We use the characterization of a tree as a cycle­free, connected, simple graph.

A ﬁnal state must be connected, because otherwise there would be two vertices with no path be­

tween them, and then a transition adding the edge between them would be possible, contradicting

ﬁnality of the state.

A ﬁnal state can’t have a cycle, because deleting any edge on the cycle would be a possible transi­

Problem.  See  if you can  come up with a  stable marriage assignment given  the  following prefer­
ences.  You are not expected to know/remember the Dating Protocol that solves this problem and 
which  is about  to be covered  in  lecture.  (And  if you do  remember  the protocol, don’t  spoil your 
teammates’ fun by telling them.)

Problem 3.  Prove that the Mating Algorithm produces stable marriages.  (Don’t look up the proof 
in the Course Notes.) 

Solution.  Proof.  We have that the following predicate, P , is an invariant of the Mating ritual: 

For  every  girl,  G,  and  every  boy,  B ,  if G  is  crossed  off B ’s  list,  then G  has  a  favorite 
suitor and she prefers him over B . 

Now  let  Bob  be  some  boy  and  Carole  be  any  girl  that  he  is  not  married  to  on  the  last  day  of 
the Mating  ritual.  We will  prove  that  Bob  and Carole  are  not  a  rogue  couple.  Since  Bob was  an 
arbitrary boy, it follows that no boy is part of a rogue couple. Hence the marriages on the last day 
are stable. 
To prove the claim, we consider two cases: 
Case 1.  Carole is not on Bob’s list.  Then since invariant P  holds, we know that Carole prefers her 
husband to Bob.  So she’s not going to run off with Bob:  the claim holds in this case. 
Case  2.  Otherwise,  Carole  is  on  Bob’s  list.  But  since  Bob  is  not married  to Carole,  he must  have 
chosen to serenade his wife instead of Carole, so he must prefer his wife.  So he’s not going to run 
off with Carole:  the claim also holds in this case.
