Problem 1.  The  following  two parts are not related.  Try  them,  to make sure you understand  the 
jargon of  random variables, distributions, probability density  functions,  etc.  Ask your TA  if you 
don’t understand/remember what some phrase means. 

(a)  Suppose X1 , X2 , and X3  are three mutually independent random variables, each having the 
uniform distribution 
Pr {Xi  =  k}  equal to 1/3  for each of k  = 1,  2,  3. 
Let M  be another random variable giving the maximum of these three random variables. What is 
the density function of M ? 

(b)  Suppose X ,  Y  are  two  independent  binomial  random  variables with  parameters  (n,   p) and 
(m,  p), respectively. What is Pr {X  +  Y  =  k}?

Problem  2.  I know  everything.  Seriously.  So,  I know  everything  that  everybody  thinks.  In par­
ticular,  I  know  who  each  one  of  the  750  billion  members  of  the  galaxy  want  to  vote  for  in  the 
upcoming elections for the Intergalactic president.  I know that a fraction p  = 0.52  of them want to 
vote for the current president. 
You  are mortal.  An  insigniﬁcant dot  in  space­time.  But  a quite  signiﬁcant dot  among dots.  You 
work closely to the current Intergalactic president and, within a week, you must answer his ago­
nizing question:  “Am I winning?” Or, in math jargon (but with the same agony):  “Is p >  1/2?” 
Your ﬁrst  idea  is to ask me (I know everything).  But you haven’t talked to me for a  long time, so 
you know  I won’t  tell you.  Your  second  idea  is  to  call  every person  in  the galaxy,  ask  them,  then 
divide the yes’s by 750 billion.  But you soon realize there is not enough time (there is a reason for 
representative democracy).  Your  third  idea. . .  You have no  third  idea!  In your panic as  the week 
is almost over, you start picking galaxy members at random, call them, and ask! 
Amazingly,  that’s  the  correct  approach.  But  you  should  be  careful what  you  are  going  to  say  to 
the president! Let’s see. 

(a)  In  your  ﬁrst  phone  call,  you  pick  one  galaxy  member  uniformly  at  random,  call,  and  ask 
whether  he/she will  vote  for  the  president.  What  is  the  probability  that  the  answer  is  going  to 
be  “yes”. . .  (i)  from my  perspective?  (ii)  from  your  perspective?  How would  you model  this  in 
terms of coin ﬂips? 

(b)  In your second phone call, you again pick a galaxy member uniformly at random, call, and ask 
whether he/she will vote for the president.  But wait!  When selecting the second voter, shouldn’t 
you exclude the guy that you asked in the ﬁrst phone call?  Maybe, but what complication comes 
from excluding him/her? 

(c)  So, in each one of n  phone calls, you pick a galaxy member uniformly at random and ask. Your 
plan is to eventually divide the number, Y  , of “yes” answers by n  to get P  ::=  Y /n. An MIT friend 
tells you that, as the numerical outcome of a random experiment, this P  is a random variable, and 
that, according to his calculations, 
Pr {|P  − p| 

≤ 0.03} ≥  0.95.

When  you  are  done  calling  people,  you  divide  to  get  P ,  and  it’s  0.53.  You  call  the  president  up 
and. . .  what do you say? 

(1)  Mr. President, p  = 0.53! 
(2)  Mr. President, with probability at least 95%, p  is within 0.03 of 0.53! 
(3)  Mr. President, either p  is within 0.03 of 0.53 or something very strange (less than 5­in­100) has 
happened. 

For each statement answer:  (i) Are you justiﬁed to claim it?  (ii) Is it true? 

A  third  problem  that  originally  appeared  here  has  been  deleted.  Few,  if  any,  teams  got  to  this 
problem; it will be postponed for a later class problem session.
