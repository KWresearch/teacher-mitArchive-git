Finding a Generating Function for Fibonacci Numbers 

The Fibonacci numbers are deﬁned by: 

f0  ::=  0 
f1  ::=  1 
fn  ::=  fn−1  +  fn−2 

(for n ≥ 2) 

Let F  be the generating function for the Fibonacci numbers, that is, 
F (x) ::=  f0  +  f1x +  f2x 2  +  f3x 3  +  f4x 4  +  · · · 
So we need to derive a generating function whose series has coefﬁcients: 
�0,	 1,  f1  +  f0 ,  f2  +  f1 ,  f3  +  f2 ,  . . . � 

Now we observe that

This sequence is almost identical to the right sides of the Fibonacci equations.  The one blemish is 
that the second term is 1 +   f0  instead of simply 1. But since f0  = 0, the second term is ok. 
So we have 

F (x) =  x  +  xF  (x) +  x 2F (x).

which satisfy: 

Now  we  expand  the  righthand  side  of  (1)  into  partial  fractions.  To  do  this,  we  ﬁrst  factor  the 
denominator 
1 − x  − x  = (1 − α1x)(1  − α2x)

Now the coefﬁcient of xn  in F (x) will be A1  times the coefﬁcient of xn  in 1/(1 − α1x) plus A2  times 
the coefﬁcient of xn  in 1/(1  − α2x).  The coefﬁcients of these fractions will simply be the terms αn

and αn  because

by the formula for geometric series. 
So we  just need  to ﬁnd ﬁnd A1  and A2 .  We do  this by plugging values of x  into  (2)  to generate 
linear equations in A1  and A2 .  It helps to note that from (2), we have 
x  =  A1 (1  − α2x) +  A2 (1  − α1x), 
so simple values to use are x  = 0  and x  = 1/α2 . We can then ﬁnd A1  and A2  by solving the linear 
equations. This gives: 

A1  =
