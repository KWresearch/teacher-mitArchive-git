Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 4, Wed.


Problem 1.  Recently MIT students have been taking a hard look at the haphazard building layout, 
and  have  been  asking  some  hard  questions.  As  always  they  know  they  can  use  their  superior 
mathematical skills to get some real answers to those hard questions. 

They  decide  to  express  the  MIT  building  layout  as  a  relation.  Let  C  be  the  set  of  all  building 
numbers  and  let R  be  the  relation  on  the  set C  such  that  (a,  b)  ∈  R  if  building  a  and  building  b 
are physically adjacent and  there  is a door between a  and b  (more  importantly, one doesn’t have 
to go outside to get from a  to b). Note that if (a,   b) ∈ R, then (b,  a) is also in R, so R  is a symmetric 
relation.  For convenience, they also deﬁne a building to be related to itself, so (a,  a) ∈ R. 

(a)  For this part only, let C  be the set of MIT buildings 10,13,12,4,8,26. Then R  looks like this: 

•	 R2  consists of all pairs of buildings that are connected by traversing exactly 2 edges. Compute 
R2  . 
•	 R≤2  consists of all pairs of buildings that are connected by traversing at most 2 edges.  Com­
pute R≤2  . 
•	 R3  consists of all pairs of buildings that are connected by traversing exactly 3 edges. Compute 
R3  . 
•	 If all self­loops were removed (i.e., all edges of the form (a,  a)), would R2  =  R≤2 ? 

Solution.  Since there are self­loops in the connectivity graph (each building is connected to itself), 
R2  includes everything which is in R  as well.  For example, (13,  10)  which is in R  must also be in

R2  because you can go from building 13  to building 10  “via 2 edges” by just going around building 
� 
� 
13   once and then moving on to building 10. That said, we conclude that 
R2  =  R  ∪  (13,  4),  (4,  13),  (10,  12),  (12,  10),  (10,  8),  (8,  10),  (12,  8),  (8,  12),  (4,  26),  (26,  4) 
R≤2  =  R2  . 
Similarly, R3  contains everything which is in R2  (because of the self­loops), plus all the extra pairs 
� 
� 
that we get by allowing connections via three edges.  So we have: 
R3  =  R2  ∪  (13,  12),  (12,  13),  (10,  26),  (26,  10),  (13,  8),  (8,  13),  (26,  12),  (12,  26) 
If the self­loops were removed, R2  would not contain (13,  13)  but R≤2  would. 

� 

(b)  We would like to connect the buildings so that for any pair of buildings (a,  b), either one can 
reach  b  from  a  or  one  can  reach  a  from  b.  The MIT  administration wants  to  keep  the  number  of 
connections between buildings as small as possible.  In other words, MIT wants the size, |R , of R
|
to be as small as possible. What is the smallest R  that will satisfy the MIT students?  Is the smallest 
R  unique? 
Solution.  The smallest graph such that all the buildings are connected would be to connect them 
in  a  straight  line.  The number of  edges  in  that graph  is n  − 1.  How do we know  that  this  is  the 
smallest  number  of  edges?  We will  learn  a  theorem  that  says  that  the  smallest  connected  graph 
with vertices n  has at least n  − 1  edges. Each edge contributes two pairs therefore  R = 2(n  − 1).
|
|
The smallest graph is not unique, for starters we can connect the buildings in a different order in 
the line. But there are many other connected graphs with n  vertices and n  − 1 edges (any tree with 
� 
n  nodes in fact satisﬁes this constraint, as we shall soon see). 

Problem 2.  (a)  What  are  the maximal  and minimal  elements,  if  any,  of  the  set,  N,  of  all  natural 
numbers under divisibility?  Is there a minimum or maximum element? 
Solution.  The minimum  (and  therefore unique minimal)  element  is  1  since  1 divides  all natural 
numbers.  The maximum (and therefore unique maximal) element is 0 since all numbers divide 0. 
� 

(b)  What are the minimal and maximal elements, if any, of the set of integers ≥ 2 under divisibil­
ity? 
Solution.  All prime numbers are minimal elements, since no numbers divide them.  Since there is 
more than one minimal element, there can’t be a minimum element. 
There is no maximal element, because for any n  ≥  2, there is a “larger ” number under the divisi­
� 
bility partial order, namely, mn, for any m  >  1.

Problem 3.  (a)  Describe a sequence consisting of  the  integers  from 1  to 10,000  in some order so 
that there is no increasing or decreasing subsequence of size 101. 

Solution. 

[100  → 1][200  → 101][300   → 201]...[10,  000  → 9901]  

� 

(b)  What is the size of the longest chain that is guaranteed to exist in any partially ordered set of 
n  elements? What about the largest antichain? 

Solution.  Chain size  is 1  in  the “discrete” partial order  in which every  two distinct elements are 
� 
incomparable. Antichain size is 1 if the partial order is total. 

(c)  Describe a partially ordered set that has no minimal or maximal elements. 
Solution.  Z, R, etc. 

� 

(d)  Describe a partially ordered set that has a unique minimal element, but no minimum element. 
Solution.  Z ∪ i  where i  is a root of −1, under the usual order Z. So i  is incomparable to everything 
� 
but itself, and is therefore minimal. 

Problem 4.  A pair of 6.042 TAs, Zardosht and Ching, have decided to devote some of their spare 
time  this  term  to establishing dominion over  the entire galaxy.  Recognizing  this as an ambitious 
project,  they worked  out  the  following  table  of  tasks  on  the  back  of  Ching’s  copy  of  the  lecture 
notes. 

1.	 Devise a logo and cool imperial theme music ­ 8 days. 

2.	 Build a ﬂeet of Hyperwarp Stardestroyers out of eating paraphernalia swiped from Lobdell 
­ 18 days. 

3.	 Seize control of the United Nations ­ 9 days, after task #1. 

4.	 Get shots for Zardosht’s cat, Emilios ­ 11 days, after task #1. 

5.	 Open a Starbucks chain for the army to get their caffeine ­ 10 days, after task #3 

6.	 Train  an  army  of  elite  interstellar warriors  by  dragging  people  to  see  The  Phantom Menace 
dozens of times ­ 4 days, after tasks #3, #4, and #5.

7. 	 Launch  the ﬂeet of  Stardestroyers,  crush  all  sentient  alien  species,  and  establish  a Galactic 
Empire ­ 6 days, after tasks #2 and #6. 

8. 	 Defeat Microsoft ­ 8 days, after tasks #2 and #6. 

(a)  Express the information in the task list using some type of graph (label the vertices to reﬂect 
task lengths). 
Solution.  The  information  in  the  table  is  represented  in  the  Figure  ??  in  the  form  of  a  directed 
acyclic  graph.  Each  vertex  represents  a  task,  and  the weight  of  a  vertex  is  the  completion  time. 
Each directed edge represents a dependency between tasks.

(b)  Give some valid order in which the tasks might be completed. 
Solution.  We can easily ﬁnd several of them.  The most natural one is valid, too:  #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, 
� 
#6, #7, #8. 

Zardosht and Ching want to complete all these tasks in the shortest possible time. However, they 
have agreed on some constraining work rules. 

•	 Only one person can be assigned to a particular task; they can not work together on a single 
task. 

Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 4, Wed.

•	 Once  a  person  is  assigned  to  a  task,  that  person must  work  exclusively  on  the  assignment 
until  it  is  completed.  So,  for  example,  Zardosht  cannot  work  on  building  a  ﬂeet  for  a  few 
days, run get shots for Emilios, and then return to building the ﬂeet. 

(c)  Zardosht and Ching want to know how long conquering the galaxy will take. Ching suggests 
dividing  the  total number of days of work by  the number of workers, which  is  two.  What  lower 
bound on the time to conquer the galaxy does this give, and why might the actual time required 
be greater? 

Solution. 

8 + 18 + 9 + 11 + 10 + 4 + 6 + 8  
2 

=  37 days

If working  together and  interrupting work on a  task were permitted,  then  this answer would be 
correct. However, the rules may prevent Zardosht and Ching from both working all the time.  � 

(d)  Zardosht proposes a different method for determining the duration of their project.  He sug­
gests  looking  at  the  duration  of  the  “critical  path”,  the  most  time­consuming  sequence  of  tasks 
such  that  each  depends  on  the  one  before.  What  lower  bound  does  this  give,  and why might  it 
also be too low? 

Solution.  The  longest  sequence  of  tasks  is  devising  a  logo  (8  days),  seizing  the  U.  N.  (9  days), 
opening a Starbucks (10 days), training the army (4 days), and then defeating Microsoft (8 days). 
Since these tasks must be done sequentially, galactic conquest will require at least 39 days. 
If  there  were  enough  workers,  this  answer  would  be  correct;  however,  with  only  two  workers, 
� 
Zardosht and Ching may be unable to make progress on the critical path every day. 

(e)  What is the minimum number of days that Zardosht and Ching need to conquer the galaxy? 
No proof is required. 

Solution.  40 days. Tasks could be divided as follows:

Ching:  #1 (days 1­8), #3 (days 9­17), #4 (days 18­28), #8 (days 33­40).

Zardosht:  #2 (days 1­18), #5 (days 19­28), #6 (days 29­32), #7 (days 33­38).

Appendix 
Deﬁnition.  Let � be a weak (reﬂexive) partial order on a set, A. 
•	 An element a  ∈ A  is a lower bound for a subset, S  ⊆ A  iff a  � s  for every s  ∈ S .  Similarly, an 
element a   ∈ A  is an upper bound for a subset, S  ⊆ A  iff s  � a  for every s  ∈ S . 
•	 An element a  ∈ A  is the minimum element iff a  is a lower bound on A.  Similarly, an element 
a  ∈ A  is the maximum element iff a  is an upper bound on A.

•	 An element a  ∈ A  is the greatest lower bound (glb) of a subset, S  ⊆ A  iff a  is a lower bound for 
S , and if b  ∈ A  is also a lower bound for S , then b   � a.  Similarly for least upper bound (lub). 
•	 An element a  ∈ A  is minimal iff there is no element in A  that is � a  except a  itself.  Similarly, 
an element a  ∈ A  is maximal iff there is no element in A  that is � a  except a  itself. 
•	 Elements a,  b  ∈  A  are comparable  iff either a  �  b  or b  �  a.  Two elements are  incomparable  iff 
they are not comparable. 
•	 A subset, S  ⊆ A  is totally ordered iff every two distinct elements in S   are comparable. 
•	 A chain is a totally ordered subset of A. 

•	 An antichain is a subset of A, such that no two elements in it are comparable.
