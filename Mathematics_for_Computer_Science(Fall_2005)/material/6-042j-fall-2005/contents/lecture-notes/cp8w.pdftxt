Problem  1.  We  begin  with  two  large  glasses.  The  ﬁrst  glass  contains  a  pint  of  water,  and  the 
second contains a pint of wine.  We pour 1/3 of a pint from the ﬁrst glass into the second, stir up 
the wine/water mixture in the second glass, and then pour 1/3 of a pint of the mix back into the 
ﬁrst glass and repeat this pouring back­and­forth process a total of n times. 

(a)  Describe a closed form formula for the amount of wine in the ﬁrst glass after n back­and­forth 
pourings. 

(b)  What is the limit of the amount of wine in each glass as n approaches inﬁnity? 

Problem 2.  Suppose you were about to enter college today and a college loan ofﬁcer offered you 
the  following deal:  $25,000 at  the  start of each year  for  four years  to pay  for your  college  tuition 
and an option of choosing one of the following repayment plans: 

Plan A:  Wait four years, then repay $20,000 at the start of each year for the next ten years. 

Plan B:  Wait ﬁve years, then repay $30,000 at the start of each year for the next ﬁve years. 

Suppose the annual interest rate paid by banks is 7% and does not change in the future. 

(a)  Assuming  that  it’s no hardship  for you  to meet  the  terms of either payback plan, which one 
is a better deal?  (You will need a calculator.) 

(b)  What is the loan ofﬁcer ’s effective proﬁt (in today’s dollars) on the loan?

Justify each line of the proof.  (P.S. The purpose of this exercise is to highlight some of the rules for 
manipulating series. Don’t worry about the signiﬁcance of this identity.)
