Problem 1.  Suppose that you ﬂip three fair, mutually independent coins.  Deﬁne the fol­
lowing events: 

•  Let A be the event that the ﬁrst coin is heads. 

•  Let B be the event that the second coin is heads. 

•  Let C be the event that the third coin is heads. 

•  Let D be the event that an even number of  coins are heads. 

(a)  Are these events pairwise independent? 

(b)  Are these events three­way independent? That is, does 
Pr {X ∩ Y  ∩ Z } =  Pr {X } · Pr {Y } · Pr {Z } 
always hold when X , Y , and Z are distinct events drawn from the set {A, B , C, D}? 
(c)  Are these events mutually independent? 

Problem 2.  There is a set of 1000 people. 

•  The favorite color of 20% of these people is blue. 

•  The favorite color of 30% is green. 

•  The favorite color of 50% is red. 

(a)  Suppose we select a sequence of two distinct people (p1 , p2 ) by selecting p1  uniformly 
at random, and then selecting p2  uniformly at random among the remaining 999 people. 
Let the random variable Ci  be the favorite color of person pi . Are C1  and C2  independent? 
Justify your answer. 

(b)  Suppose we  select  a  sequence  of  two  people  (q1 , q2 )  uniformly  at  random.  (Now  it 
may be  that q1  =  q2 .)  Let  the random variable Di  be  the  favorite color of qi .  Now are D1 
and D2  independent?  Justify your answer.

Problem 3.  Suppose that we create a national database of DNA proﬁles. Let’s make some 
simplifying  assumptions  (for  the  purposes  of  this  problem,  don’t worry  about whether 
these assumptions are reasonable): 

•	 Each  person  can  be  classiﬁed  into  one  of  20 billion  different  “DNA  types”.  (For 
example,  you might  be  type  #13,646,572,661  and  the  person  next  to  you might  be 
type #2,785,466,098.) 

•	 Each DNA type is equally probable. 

•	 The DNA types of Americans are mutually independent. 

(a)  A  congressman  argues  that  there  are  only  about  250 million  Americans,  so  even  if 
a  proﬁle  for  every  American  were  stored  in  the  database,  the  probability  of  even  one 
coincidental match would be very small.  How many proﬁles must the database actually 
contain in order for the probability of at least one coincidental match be about 1/2? 

(b)  Person  x  is  arrested  for  a  crime  that  was  committed  by  person  y .  At  trial,  jurors 
must  determine whether  x  =  y .  The  crime  lab  says  x  and  y  have  the  same  DNA  type. 
The  prosecutor  argues  that  the  probability  that  x  and  y  are  different  people  is  only  1  in 
20  billion.  Let  T (x)  denote  the DNA  type  of  person  x.  Using  T ,  write  the  prosecutor ’s 
assertion in mathematical notation, and explain her error. 

Problem  4.  Suppose  there  are  100  people  in  a  room.  Assume  that  their  birthdays  are 
independent and uniformly distributed. As stated in lecture: 

If there are N  days in a year and m  people in a room, then the probability that 
no two people in the room have the same birthday is very close to: 
e−m2 /(2N ) 

It follows that with probability >  99%  there will be two people with the same birthday. 
Now suppose you  learn  the birthdays of all  the people  in  the room except one—call her 
“Jane”—and ﬁnd all 99 dates to be different. 

(a)  What’s wrong with the following argument: 

With  probability  greater  than  99%,  some  pair  of  people  in  the  room  have 
the same birthday.  Since  the 99 people we asked all had different birthdays,  it 
follows  that  with  probability  greater  than  99%  Jane  has  the  same  birthday  as 
some other person in the room. 

(b)  What is the actual probability that Jane has the same birthday as some other person 
in the room?
