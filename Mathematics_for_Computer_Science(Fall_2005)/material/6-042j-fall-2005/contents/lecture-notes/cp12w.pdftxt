Problem 1.  A Barglesnort makes its lair in one of three caves: 

The  Barglesnort  inhabits  cave  1  with  probability  1/2,  cave  2  with  probability  1/4,  and 
cave 3 with probability 1/4. A rabbit subsequently moves into one of the two unoccupied 
caves,  selected  with  equal  probability.  With  probability  1/3,  the  rabbit  leaves  tracks  at 
the  entrance  to  its  cave.  (Barglesnorts  are much  too  clever  to  leave  tracks.)  What  is  the 
probability  that  the Barglesnort  lives  in  cave  3,  given  that  there  are no  tracks  in  front  of 
cave 2? 
Use a tree diagram and the four­step method. 

Problem 2.  There is a rare and deadly disease called Nerditosis which afﬂicts about 1 per­
son in 1000. One symptom is a compulsion to refer to everything— ﬁelds of study, classes, 
buildings,  etc.—  using  numbers.  It’s  horrible.  As  victims  enter  their  ﬁnal,  downward 
spiral,  they’re  awarded  a  degree  from  MIT.  Two  doctors  claim  that  they  can  diagnose 
Nerditosis. 

(a)  Doctor  X  received  his  degree  from  Harvard Medical  School.  He  practices  at Mas­
sachusetts General Hospital and has access to the latest scanners, lab tests, and research. 
Suppose you ask Doctor X  whether you have the disease. 

•  If you have Nerditosis, he says “yes” with probability 0.99. 
•  If you don’t have it, he says “no” with probability 0.97.

Let D be the event that you have the disease, and let E be the event that the diagnosis is 
erroneous.  Use the Total Probability Law to compute Pr {E }, the probability that Doctor 
X makes a mistake.

(b)  “Doctor ” Y  received his genuine degree from a fully­accredited university for $49.95 
via a special internet offer. He knows that Nerditosis stikes 1 person in 1000, but is a little 
shakey  on  how  to  interpret  this.  So  if  you  ask  him whether  you  have  the  disease,  he’ll 
helpfully  say  “yes” with  probability  1  in  1000  regardless  of whether  you  actually  do  or 
not. 
Let D  be  the  event  that  you  have  the  disease,  and  let  F  be  the  event  that  the  diagnosis 
is faulty.  Use the Total Probability Law to compute Pr {F }, the probability that Doctor Y 
made a mistake. 

(c)  Which doctor is more reliable? 

Problem 3.  Suppose there is a system with n components, and we know from past expe­
rience that any particular component will fail in a given year with probability p.  That is, 
letting Fi  be the event that the ith component fails within one year, we have 
Pr {Fi} =  p 
for  1  ≤  i  ≤  n.  The  system will  fail  if  any  one  of  its  components  fails.  What  can we  say 
about the probability that the system will fail within one year? 
Let F  be the event that the system fails within one year. Without any additional assump­
tions, we  can’t get  an  exact  answer  for Pr {F }.  However, we  can give useful upper  and 
lower bounds, namely, 
p ≤ Pr {F } ≤ np. 
(1) 
So for example,  if n  = 100   and p = 10−5 , we conclude that there is at most one chance in 
1000 of system failure within a year and at least one chance in 100,000. 
Let’s model this situation with the sample space S ::=  P ({1, . . . , n}) of subsets of positive 
integers ≤ n, where s ∈ S corresponds to the indices of the components which fail within 
one year.  For example, {2, 5} is the outcome that the second and ﬁfth components failed 
within  a year  and none of  the other  components  failed.  So  the outcome  that  the  system 
did not fail corresponds to the emptyset, ∅. 

(a)  Show  that  the probability  that  the  system  fails  could be  as  small  as  p by describing 
appropriate probabilities for the sample points.

(b)  Show that the probability that the system fails could actually could be as large as np 
by describing appropriate probabilities for the sample points. 

(c)  Prove the inequality (1). 

Problem 4.  There were n  Immortal Warriors born into our world, but in the end there can 
be only one. The Immortals’ original plan was to stalk the world for centuries, dueling one 
another  with  ancient  swords  in  dramatic  landscapes  until  only  one  survivor  remained. 
However,  after  a  thought­provoking  discussion  of  probabilistic  independence,  they  opt 
to give the following protocol a try: 

1.  The Immortals forge a coin that comes up heads with probability p. 

2.  Each Immortal ﬂips the coin once. 

3.  If  exactly one  Immortal ﬂips heads,  then he or  she  is declared The One.  Otherwise, 
the protocol is declared a failure, and they all go back to hacking each other up with 
swords. 

(a)  One of the Immortals (Kurgan from the Russian steppe) argues that as n  grows large, 
the  probability  that  this  protocol  succeeds  must  tend  to  zero.  Another  (McLeod  from 
the  Scottish  highlands)  argues  that  this  need  not  be  the  case,  provided  p  is  chosen  very 
carefully. What does your intuition tell you? 

(b)  What is the probability that the experiment succeeds as a function of p  and n? 

(c)  How  should  p,  the  bias  of  the  coin,  be  chosen  in  order  to maximize  the  probability 
that the experiment succeeds?  (You’re going to have to compute a derivative!) 

(d)  What is the probability of success if p  is chosen in this way? What quantity does this 
approach when n, the number of Immortal Warriors, grows large?
