Theorem. 

2 is an irrational number.

Proof.  The  proof  is  by  contradiction.  Assume  for purpose  of  contradiction  that 
rational. 
√
2 =   m/n  where m  and n  are integers and the fraction is in lowest 
Then we can write 
terms. Squaring both sides gives 2 =  m2/n2 , so 2n2  =  m2 . This implies that m2  is even, 
and hence that m  is even;  that is, m  is a multiple of 2.  But that means m2  is actually a 
multiple of 4, say m2  = 4k . 
Now we have 2n2  =  m2  = 4k , so n2  = 2k .  So n2  is even, and hence n  is even. But since 
m  and n  are both even, the fraction m/n  is not in lowest terms, a contradiction.

Solution.  We prove that for any n  >   1, 
2  is irrational by contradiction.

where a  and b  have no common factors (so that the fraction a/b  is in lowest terms). Now we prove 
that a  and b  are both even, which contradicts the existence of a,  b.

The lefthand side of the last equation is even, so an  is even. This implies that a  is even as well (see 
below for justiﬁcation). 
In particular, a  = 2c  for some integer c. Thus,

Since n  − 1  >  0, the righthand side of the last equation is an even number, so bn  is even.  But this 
implies that b  must be even as well, contradicting the fact that m/n   is in lowest terms. 

Now we justify the claim that if an  is even, so is a. 
There is a simple proof by contradiction:  suppose a  was not even, i.e., a  is odd.  It’s a familiar (and 
easily veriﬁed)  fact  that  the product  of  any number  of  odd numbers  is  odd,  so  an  would  also be 
odd, contradicting the fact that an  is even. 
But more generally for any integers m,  k >  0, if mk  is divisible by a prime number, p, then m  must 
be divisible by p. This follows from the factorization of an integer into primes (which we’ll discuss 
further  in a coming  lecture):  the primes  in  the  factorization of mk  are precisely  the primes  in  the 
factorization of m  repeated k  times, so if there is a p  in the factorization of mk  it must be one of k 
copies of a p  in the factorization of m.

Here’s a somewhat broader generalization of the proof that

Lemma.  Let the coefﬁcients of the polynomial a0  +  a1x  +  a2x 2  +
polynomial is either integral or irrational. 

√
2  is irrational: x  − 2  has no integer root because 2 is not a perfect square, 
so the real roots, namely, ±√
2
Notice that this Lemma directly implies that 
2, must be  irrational.  Similarly,  if m  ∈  N  is not the kth power of an  integer,  then x  − m

has no integer roots, so 
m  will be irrational.

a0  +  a1 r  +  a2 r  +

n 

There are three cases for r :  it  is either  integral,  irrational, or the ratio of two  integers with no common divisors where 
the denominator is greater than one. We want to eliminate the last case. 

So assume to the contrary that r  =  s/t  for integers s  and t  which have no common divisors and such that t  >  1. Now t 
must have a prime divisor, p. 

Substituting s/t  for r  and multiplying both sides of the above equation by tn  yields:

(2) 
Then p divides each term of the lefthand side of equation (2), and therefore also divides the righthand side, viz., p  | −s 
n
But this means that p  must also divide s.  So p  is a common divisor of s  and t, contradicting our choice of s  and t.

Problem 2.  1  A set of propositions is consistent if there is a possible situation in which they are all 
true. This problem examines whether the following speciﬁcations are consistent. 

1From Rosen, 5th edition, Exercise 1.1.36 

Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 2, Mon. 

1.  If the ﬁle system is not locked, then 

3 

(a)  new messages will be queued. 
(b)  new messages will be sent to the messages buffer. 
(c)  the  system  is  functioning  normally,  and  conversely,  if  the  system  is  functioning  nor­
mally, then the ﬁle system is not locked. 

2.  If new messages are not queued, then they will be sent to the messages buffer. 

3.  New messages will not be sent to the message buffer. 

(a)  Begin  by  translating  the  parts  of  the  speciﬁcation  into  propositional  formulas  using  four 
propositional variables: 

L 

Q 

B 

N 

::=  ﬁle system locked, 
::=  new messages are queued,  
::=  new messages are sent to the message buffer, 
::= 
system functioning normally.  

Solution.  The translations of the speciﬁcations are: 
¬ L  −→ Q 
¬ L  −→ B 
¬  ←→ 
L
N 
¬ Q −→ B 
¬ B 

(Spec. 1.(a)) 
(Spec. 1.(b)) 
(Spec. 1.(c)) 
(Spec. 2.) 
(Spec. 3.) 
� 

(b)  To  be precise,  the  speciﬁcation  is  consistent  if  there  is  a  single  choice  of  truth  values  for  the 
variables L, Q, B , N , so that every one the propositional formulas from the previous part are true. 
Explain how to use a truth table to determine whether the speciﬁcation is consistent. 

Solution.  We can construct a  truth  table with sixteen  lines—one  for each way of assigning  truth 
values  to  the  four  variables  L,  N ,  Q,  and  B .  For  each  line,  we  could  record  the  truth  values  of 
these ﬁve statements above. 
If all ﬁve statements are true for some assignment of truth values to the variables, then the system 
is  consistent.  If  for  every  one  of  the  sixteen  possible  truth  assignments,  at  least  one  of  the  ﬁve 
statements is false,  then the system is inconsistent.  Carrying out the calculation shows that there 
is  a  unique  assignment  of  True/False  values  to  L,  N ,  Q,  and  B  (see  below)  that  satisﬁes  all  the 
� 
speciﬁcations. 

(c)  Use simple reasoning by cases to ﬁnd a truth assignment that conﬁrms that this system speciﬁ­
cation is consistent. Explain why there is only one such assignment.

Solutions to In­Class Problems Week 2, Mon. 

Solution.  We can avoid the full truthtable calculation if we reason by cases.

Case 1 (B  is True): Then the last formula, (Spec. 3.), is false, and the whole speciﬁcation is false. 

Case  2  (B  is  False):  Now  (Spec.  2.)  and  (Spec.  1.(b))  can  be  true  only  if Q  and L  are  true.  Since

L  is  true,  (Spec.  1.(c))  can  be  true  only  if N  is  false.  Thus,  we  have  deduced  that  in  order  to  be

consistent, we must have 

L  =  True 
N  =  False 
Q  =  True 
B  =  False. 

From  the  way  this  assignment  was  constructed,  we  know  it  ensures  that  formulas  from  (Spec. 
1.(b))  on  are  true.  So  all  that  remains  is  to  check  formula  (Spec.  1.(a)),  and  indeed  it  is  also  true 
under this assignment. 
So the system is consistent, and this is the only assignment that will satisfy it.
