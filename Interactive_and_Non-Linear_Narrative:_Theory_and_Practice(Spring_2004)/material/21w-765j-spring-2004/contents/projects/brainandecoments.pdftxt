1) On the process of anticipation and retrospection, it has usually been the case that the author plays with 
our anticipation to keep a story interesting and has certain events occur or says something that makes the 
reader re-evaluate a certain previous point or event in a different frame of mind that is often set up by 
the author.  Often times playing with our anticipation causes retrospection, which has happend to me 
often such as when there is an unexpected death of a major character. 

Another aspect of retrospection that Iser's "The Reading Process" may not have touched on is what a 
reader gets by applying what he reads to his own life.  For example, a thought provoking quote can have 
different meanings to different people, or even to the same person at different times when they try to 
apply it to their life.  This occurs to a lot of people when they read the bible - I often hear people say that 
they always get something different from rereading a passage at different points in their life as if it's 
meaning has totally changed. 

I can't really think of any specific examples, but that is probably because I havn't read very many books 
lately.
