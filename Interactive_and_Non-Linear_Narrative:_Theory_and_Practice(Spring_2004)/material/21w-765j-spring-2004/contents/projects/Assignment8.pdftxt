Assignment 8:

1) For Monday:

Finish your audio project and – if possible – post it to our shared site.
Class presentations will be held Monday and Wednesday. Please post a
short description of your project that includes the overall concept,
questions of narrative that you tried to address, and the envisioned user
experience.

2) For Wednesday:

Get in conversation with two of the following ELIZAs. Capture your
conversation and post an electronic version to BSCW; bring also a printout
to class. Which characters/versions did you find easiest to converse with?
What increased the sense of verisimilitude? Which interchanges were
believable or amusing and which seemed as if there was comprehension
between the two characters?

3) For Wednesday:

Please read the two articles by Joseph Weizenbaum: “ELIZA – A Computer

the Association for Computing Machinery, 8 (1967). Be prepared to discuss
them in light of your own experience with ELIZA.
