Databasical Laughter 

 
Overall Concept 
Like our previous project, “A Phone Survey Saga,” this piece utilizes the database format 
to organize various portrayals of laughter and the definition thereof. We also integrated 
some of the associative ideas from our first project, “HEXAGON.” However, instead of 
associating different parts of grammatical structure, we juxtaposed different media: 
audio, text, images, and video. 
 
The database, as discussed in Lev Manovich's paper, has been a very useful 
organizational tool in collecting and displaying a collection of a myriad of narratives. 
Here, we have two types of audio: one is a conglomeration of laughs, whereas the other 
probes into people’s answers to the question, “What is laughter?” In text, we see the 
definition of laughter from dictionaries and medical sources, going a bit deeper into 
hysteria. As a source of laughter, we can read random jokes, from a plethora of sources. 
The video continuously plays a laughing reaction of several everyday people. On the 
bottom of the screen, the images depict different forms of the laugh, from caricatures and 
stick figures to photographs and a diagram of the mental mechanism behind this physical 
function. The juxtaposition of the media explorations create a dynamic environment for 
the users to explore the basics and elaborations upon the simple “ha ha ha.”  
 
Development and Implementation of Project 
The user interface was created using Adobe Photoshop and Macromedia Flash. First, the 
background image was generated with Adobe Photoshop. Due to our desire to create a 
very easy explorative piece, we made the image very simple, with a few painted 
adornments to enhance the labeling of the media. The bulk of the project then emphasizes 
the elucidation of laughter through text, audio, images, and video.  
 
For the image portion of the interface, various visual photographs and pictures were taken 
from a Google search. One audio track is spliced and mixed from the audio for the 
current video. This video was primarily filmed for a friend’s birthday party; a picture of 
him making an odd face was shown to various strangers, whose responses ranged from 
pure confusion to embarrassed titters to outlandish guffaws. A bit of maniacal laughter is 
also thrown in there from a friend reflecting on a tissue box.  
 
Intending to make two videos, we interviewed several people, asking “What is laughter?” 
However, we were not able to edit or implant the video for this series of interviews, and 
therefore included it solely on the audio track. The video portion of the interface also 
does not have any sound; however, we feel that the animated images contribute to the  
piece in a wholly separate manner than the pure audio. 
 

We used Flash to put all of these elements together.   Two videos were inserted so that 
they loop as the interface is displayed.  The texts are scrollable so that the user can have 
control over what he/she sees.  The audio tracks can be heard by clicking on buttons on 
the interface. These buttons change color as the mouse hovers over them.  Images can be 
seen when the user moves his mouse over the image area.  
 
Envisioned User Experience 
This project depicts the various layers associated with the idea of laughter, from its 
definition and the act of laughing to facial expressions and medical terms associated with 
laughter. The connotations and portrayals are fun to play around with and explore, 
whether the user prefers pictures, sound, words, or movies. 
 
Each audio track, image, text or video can interpreted in various ways, and all of them 
have a story behind them.  We hope that, as users play with our project, they can come up 
with their own interpretation of these individual elements and their own stories of how 
each of them relate to one another.  In addition, users are free to construct narratives 
using these depictions by either sequentially connecting the four elements or freely 
associating within one category.  
 
Improvements and Technical Set-backs 
The project itself was severely limited in terms of time and technical knowledge; if 
creating a more polished interface, we would probably have organized the text so that the 
scrolling option is more apparent. We would have tweaked the video file so it could be 
played backwards or forwards, and enable the users to stop or start the video and audio 
components as desired. The images and text would probably have been more interesting 
if randomly generated. We also wanted to enable the users to add to our database with 
their own narratives or interpretations of laughter; however, this would require some 
intense technical maneuvering. Any ideas or input would be much appreciated; however, 
in the meantime, feel free to check out what we do have.  
 
Questions of Narrative Addressed 
This piece is more of a conglomeration of narratives than a set, linear story. People’s 
interpretations of the piece and of laughter itself will occur through physical and mental 
associations. The juxtaposition of the various media, combined with each user’s 
individual memories and experiences, will create an overall story of exploration. The 
users will then go on to explore the presence, definition, and varieties of laughter in their 
own lives. The basics of the happiest human physical action are portrayed in this piece of 
databasical laughter. The real narrative occurs when our users compile their own 
narratives based on their experiences, utilizing these pieces to define their own instances 
of laughing thoughts. As Jean Houston stated, “At the height of laughter, the universe is 
flung into a kaleidoscope of new possibilities.”
