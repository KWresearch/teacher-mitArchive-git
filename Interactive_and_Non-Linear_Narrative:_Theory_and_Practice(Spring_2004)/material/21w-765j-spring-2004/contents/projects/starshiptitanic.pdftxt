Starship Titanic

Known mainly for his highly popular 
series Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, 
Douglas Adams was really interested in 
technology.  The game Starship Titanic 
was supposed to be a new wave in 
interactive gaming.  Due to some final-
final deadlines and an original 
underestimation of the technical 
complexity involved, what was 
promised wasn’t quite achieved, but 
what resulted is still pretty cool.

How Much will That Cost?

As the game opens, a spaceship crashes into your home.  You can 
stick around Earth and call the carpenters, or go aboard. 

Unfortunately, the ship is the Starship Titanic, the newest and 
brightest, and something has gone horribly wrong. 

Now, all you have to 
do is figure out what 
happened, fix it, and 
ask the robots in 
control to drop you 
back off on Earth.

Where Am I?
Criticism of the game include 
comments such as: it’s too 
slow, nothing’s going on, and 
what am I supposed to do and 
why should I care?  In-game 
help is limited- Information 
comes from robots and a 
parrot, the parrot wants a 
cracker and the robots are…  
malfunctioning.

Interestingly, these are also the aspects that can make it rather fun.  The 
game is directed almost entirely by the user.  Completion of certain tasks 
leads to new tasks, access to new spaces, and more information, as 
expected.  But guidance is limited.  Nothing happens unless the user tries to 
make something happen (such as calling a robot.)  In this way the user is a 
confused, lost Earthman, stuck on a broken spaceship until he can figure it out 
and get home.

And in the End, There Was…
Breaking it down, the game itself isn’t exactly edge-of-your-seat cool.

What is cool is the narrative.  While communicating with characters in 
the game can be frustrating, much effort was spent in recording some 
16 hours of possible dialogue,  and some big names were roped in.

So it’s funny.  The ship is 
filled with characters, albeit 
the only human (besides you) 
is dead.  Prodding them to 
discover what possibilities 
Adams et al. thought of often 
overshadows the objective.

Easy to see how this system, 
with a more developed set 
story (book illustration?) is a 
great medium for Adams’ 
work.
