Tess Diduch 
11.2.04 
Talmud 
 
Reflection of oral roots? 
 
The written Talmud looks very much like an onion.  The oral traditions 
themselves built on previous discussion, integrating the whole body of knowledge 
through human minds.  As a result, many discussions revolve about each small 
segment of the original texts.  Since these overlap and self-refer, it is 
natural to think of a cloud of text, with the older, more complrehensive at the 
center, and newer and more specific layered around the outside.  This is pretty 
much what they have done, although the format of a managably sized book forced 
page divisions.  On the other hand, the book format also allows the venerated 
(Rashi) to symbolically be at the heart of the book.  The format also allows the 
reader to follow the discussion over the years and by topic, simply by reading 
the passages in a certain order, though this order is not mandated, like it 
would be in a straight linear format.   
 
consequences for reading talmud? 
 
Because of the layered format, the reader is encouraged to integrate knowledge 
of these seperate thinkers in much the same way as the original participants in 
discussion did.  In the linear format, it is easy to accept each passage as it 
comes, and not differentiate.  Even by placement on page, it is reinforced that 
each of these passages are thoughts on one idea, not existing seperate from 
other writings, but overlapping and interacting with them.  Thus there is 
probably a spiriturality imparted simply by the reading of the Talmud.  The 
reader feels like a part of the text, submerged in the results of generations of 
earnest discussion on holy text.  It is history, depth and breadth weighted with 
figures of importance in the religion.
