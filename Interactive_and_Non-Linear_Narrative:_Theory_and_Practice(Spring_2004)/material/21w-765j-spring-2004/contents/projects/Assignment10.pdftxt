21W.765J, 21L.489J, CMS.845

Assignment 10:

Watch one of the following films:

• Groundhog Day (Harold Ramis – 1993)
• Rashomon (Akira Kurasawa – 1950))
• Sliding Doors (Peter Howitt – 1998)
• Memento (Christopher Nolan – 2000)
• Time Code (Mike Figgis - 2000)
• The Limey (Stephen Soderberg – 1999)

Make notes of how the film constructs its non-linear and/or parallel
narrative.

What are the techniques employed in this film that divert from a more
traditional linear story telling?

What effect does this have on the evolvement of the story?

What are the “pleasures” (Janet Murray) that arise from the film’s non-
linear and/or parallel narrative?

Post a brief comment (1 page) on BSCW and be prepared to present
your film in class.
