21W.765J, 21L.489J, CMS.845

Assignment 4:

1) Read Wolfgang Iser’s “The Reading Process” from his book The Implied
Reader. In analyzing the reading process, Iser identifies three aspects that
define the relationship between the reader and the text:
a) The process of anticipation and retrospection
b) The unfolding of the text as a living event
c) The impression of life-likeness

Take one of these aspects and post a brief comment on BSCW about your
own experience as a reader as it relates to this aspect. Use a text or texts
that you have read as an example.

2) Read Paul Fournel’s Suburbia and observe your own reading process as
you try to fill in the ‘gaps’ (Iser). What is the text about that you are trying
to construct as a reader? Are the references helpful or distracting? How is the
author playing with us as readers? Take some notes and bring them to next
class for discussion.
