Interactive and Non-Linear Narrative: Theory and Practice
21W.765J, 21L.489J, CMS.845

Project I: Visual Narrative

The first project explores notions of non-/multi-linear and/or interactive
narratives such as reader involvement, evolving narrative structure, role
of the author(s), etc.

To make things a little more complex, the first project needs to be based
on two forms of media: image and text; with the additional twist that
should be a discrepancy in obvious meaning of the text-based and the
image-based narrative (c.f Story Art).

You are free to pick the narrative; you can base your projects narrative on
an existing narrative (e.g. in a book) or you can invent a new one.

There are three phases to the project:
1) Presentation of idea to the class on February 18
2) Presentation of beta-version on February 25
3) Presentation of final project on March 3

This first project as well as the remaining two other projects is a group
project. Please work with others in the class who have the
technical/artistic/writing skills that you need for your project.

Each project needs to be accompanied by a design document that
describes in detail the concept, the implementation, and the achieved
result/lessons learned. This design document as well as a compressed
archive of your project should be posted onto the Student project folder in
BSCW.
