Groundhog Day Harold Ramis -1993 

 
The film Groundhog Day diverts from traditionally linear films for many 
 
reasons.  First, the story takes on a repetitive nature that would normally be 
considered annoying and uneventful, but the reason for this repetition is the 
heart of the story and becomes the framework in which events unfold 
throughout the film.  
 
The film stars Bill Murray as Phil Conners, an ego-centric weatherman on 
assignment in Punxatony Pennsylvania for the big Groundhog Day celebration 
on February second.  The conceited, cynical protagonist begins to reassess his 
values when he miraculously wakes up day after day on February second and 
relives the same day’s events over and over again.  Incredulous, he goes to a 
psychiatrist and a doctor to seek help but the phenomenon continues to occur.  
He experiments with this miracle and learns that there would be no long-term 
consequences to his actions.  He goes through stages of recklessness, followed 
by several suicide attempts, endeavors to woo women, and finally the 
realization that he could do a lot of good by knowing what will happen that 
day.  
 
Therefore, because of its fantastical nature, the repetition of the same 
day’s overall dialogue and sequence of events adds another dimension to the 
film.  It creates what Janet Murray terms a “procedural” framework.  It is a 
film that has a procedural set of rules that resets the same day’s events over 
and over.  However, Phil’s actions each time create the variation within the 
framework that defines the film.  In addition, his experimentation tests the 
limits of the films structure.  Janet Murray mentions that one of the pleasures 
of a computational medium is testing the limits of what it can do.  Similarly, 
the film’s limits are tested by Phil’s actions.   
 
In addition, as a member of the audience, you are also trying figure out 
what he has to do to make the repetition of the same day stop.  The structure 
of the film becomes so second nature to the audience that when the 
repetitious sequence is finally broken, we are startled (as is Phil).  Therefore 
this framework was also powerful in that it brings the audience into the plight 
of the protagonist and makes us feel like him.  
 
I feel that the parallel, or repetitious nature of the film, while at first 
annoying, created a wonderful set of limitations with which to play with 
throughout the narrative and thus enriched the message of the film.
