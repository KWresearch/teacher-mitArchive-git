The Reading Process, Wolfgang Iser 
 
 
The one text that has overwhelmed me the most emotionally is, by far, 
Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell, which I read at age 15. Because I was 
so engrossed in the 1037 page novel, I barely slept and finished reading it in 
almost 4 days. I had read several books set at the time of the Civil War and 
expected this book to be another romance story. However, all of my expectations 
were absolutely wrong. For example, I remember the shock when, upon reading 
page 100, Scarlet accepts Charles Hamilton’s marriage proposal. What on earth 
would happen in the rest of the book if she’s already gotten married? While 
reading this novel, I felt a complete loss of control as each successive event 
contradicted my expectations or renewed them. 
 
Iser explains the idea of anticipation and retrospection and the emotional 
involvement necessary for the reader to become involved in the narrative. He 
mentions that only when characters and places become a creation, or illusion, in 
our own minds do we experience the imaginative unfolding of the text. In my 
case, the historical setting of the story supported the realism of the characters 
and events. In addition, I could not understand why other readers saw Scarlett as 
a selfish, spoiled brat. I felt that I could relate to her and so I justified her actions 
and feelings in my mind. Naturally I did not see myself as spoiled or treacherous 
and, therefore, I didn’t see her as such. Therefore, the interpretation of the 
characters is also dependent on the attitude of the reader and the level of 
sympathy s/he has. 
 
Iser also describes the importance of retrospection in reformulating 
expectations. Naturally, we tend to pick out patterns in the text and might thus fall 
into the trap of expecting similar events to unfold. However, in Gone With the 
Wind I fell into the trap of thinking that Scarlett would remarry n number of times 
until the very end, when she and Rhett would marry and live happily ever after. 
Sadly, the story does not develop that way and even the characters do not 
behave as expected. Moreover, when I reread the novel at age 18 I discovered 
that knowing what was going to happen at the end of the book did not destroy the 
power of the narrative.  On the contrary, I began to see so many new 
connections at different levels in the story, that I enjoyed it even more in the 
second reading. 
 
The notion of anticipation and retrospection in a narrative text or film is an 
abstraction of the process of understanding our own story, events and emotions. 
We hold certain expectations of ourselves and reassess our goals based on the 
events of the past. In addition, we are constantly discovering ourselves and why 
we act and react to things as individuals. Therefore, the act of reading is an 
exercise in our ability to expect the future by assessing events of the past.
