Pick one of the four digital properties she defines 
and write a brief comment, using one of the media works 
(digital/film/audio) we have used in class as an example. 
 
The digital interface that we played with in class of a coal mine illustrates 
the participatory digital properties.  When the user places his mouse over 
certain objects in the scene, he hears a sound clip.  It isn't until the user 
has heard several of these clips (order doesn't really matter) before he 
realizes that what he's hearing are conversations spoken by the miners.  Thus, 
the story develops as the user interacts with the scene.  However, the program 
isn't as participatory as it can be because the audio clips are static and the 
scene is static.  Nothing changes about the program after the user listens to a 
clip or navigates around the scene.  This perhaps makes for a less effective 
game interface, but it wasn't necessary for what the creators were trying to 
achieve. 
 
What makes the project highly effective is that the user is placed in a setting 
that has no identity, so that a variety of possible stories can take place.  But 
by hearing the audio, the user is able to narrow down those choices.  The user 
is brought in context.
