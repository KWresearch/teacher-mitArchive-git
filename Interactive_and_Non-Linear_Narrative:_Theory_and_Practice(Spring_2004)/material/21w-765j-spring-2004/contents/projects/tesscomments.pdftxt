There seems to be a significant overlap between Hamlet's ideas of Participitory and 
Spacial.  ELIZA is not spacial, but most examples, especially more recent ones, involve 
some kind of environment, probably due to the convienence of a monitor.   
 
“Weekend” offers an interesting look at the Spacial compontent.  It is very similar to the 
“movie map” of Aspen that Hamlet describes, except that it is sound instead of visual, 
and attention is on one person moving through the space rather than the person at the 
computer choosing a path by clicking.  It is easy to imagine “Weekend” as an early 
exploration into a form, and a forerunner to interactive spacial auditory environments.  It 
would be fairly trivial to set up a database such that a listener can make ambulatory 
decisions for themselves, rather than relying on the static recording.  They then can create 
their own weekend, while still following the artistic vision of the creators. 
 
What is unclear is whether visual description, whether text or picture based, would be 
necessary.  Most people don't have a highly developed sense of auditory space, and so 
could get muddled easily.  Skipping ahead to surround sound would help.  Visuals have 
been stuck in the 2D environment, which works because actual immersion is not 
necessary.  Some system with headphones and good stereo, with a controller that lets a 
person 'walk' in a direction, might be ideal, or at least one way to go about it.   
 
“Weekend” also has hints of the Participitory, through imaginationa nd interpretation of 
sounds, which begs the question: since images associated on a computer are static, at 
some level, can it ever be as satisfying as what we imagine when reading literature or 
listening to certain genres?
