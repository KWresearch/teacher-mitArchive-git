 
Rashomon investigates the method of narrating a story from different viewpoints.  
The same story is told from the perspective of the four different characters who are 
involved.  Through each retelling, the viewer notices how the story is biased towards the 
narrator.   
 
The premise of the story is that of a woman who gets raped by a crook.  What 
happens next is the narrative that is in question.  What is clear is that her husband gets 
killed, but how he gets killed is unclear.  Each of the characters tells a different story 
about how he dies.  The crook explains that he killed the husband.  The woman says she 
kills him.  The husband’s spirit tells through a medium that he committed suicide.  A 
witness to the scene finally reveals the truth. 
 
As each version of the story unfolds, it becomes clear that it is very difficult to 
define what the objective truth is.  Each character has a personal stake in the story and 
bends it to his or her interest.  In the end, it is revealed that even the witness (who 
watched the incident from afar) hid a detail of the story because he too becomes involved 
in it. 
 
The pleasures that arise from this structure is that the viewer is constantly trying 
to figure out what really happened.  It’s a mystery but instead of revealing clues, the 
entire story is revealed.  The complication is that the stories involves more fictional 
elements than truths.
