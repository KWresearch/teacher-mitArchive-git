This is not for you. 
-dedication, House of Leaves 

 
   I was immediately drawn into the rest of the book before even beginning to read the 

body of the novel.  As I read on, I questioned the nature of this mysterious dedication.  

Who wrote it—the true author of the book, Mark Danielewski; Johnny Truant, the author 

of the forward; or the omnipresent editors, who never fully step into the story, but are 

always around for a side comment or two?     

    The central narrative of House of Leaves, is conveyed through many layers of 

storytelling.  Like the Talmud, there is a core of information surrounded by multiple 

layers of commentary.  At the heart of it is the spurious film The Navidson Record, a 

documentary supposedly created by the notoriously gifted cinematographer Will 

Navidson.  Commenting on this film is Zampanò, a man who is dead before we know 

him.  He has left behind a number of fictional works as well as several commentaries on 

the phony film.   

  Through the Introduction I was immediately immersed in the life of Johnny Truant.  In 

this introduction we also learn of his connection to Zampanò.  While examining the crime 

scene surrounding Zampanò’s mysterious death, Johnny and his friend Lude uncover 

Zampanò’s life’s work and decide to publish it.  In essence, House of Leaves is that 

publication.  Throughout this documentation are footnotes made by both Johnny and the 

Editors.  Through these footnotes we learn more Zampanò, Navidson and Johnny.  We 

also learn that the Editors are not actually the true editors of the book, but that they are 

also creations spawned from Danielewski’s mind.    

     The physical format and placement of the text within the page break down the 

conventions of a typical narrative.  The novel is at first familiarly book-like, that is, the 

body of the text contains the main narrative and the footnotes briefly comment where 

they are appropriate.   As the reader becomes more immersed in the text, however, 

predictable structure begins to break down.  Footnotes being to invade body, body fades, 

and text becomes melded.  As the footnotes begin to physically merge, certain concepts 

touched on in Zampanò’s text become the subject of Truant’s jaded ramblings.  For 

example, Zampanò mentions a broken water heater that Navidson deals with in one of his 

films.  In the footnotes of that page, Truant tells us that his water heater is also broken.  

At this point, it may strike the reader as an eerie coincidence, but later Truant confesses 

to have added the “water” to the original writing.  This calls into question the reader’s 

confidence in Truant to maintain the integrity of Zampanò’s work.  Soon, however, it 

becomes apparent that not only is Truant overstepping into the space reserved for the 

actual text, but Zampanò’s ideas also begin to seep into his space.  For example, Truant 

mentions that he feels “a bit like a broken thermos—fine on the outside, but on the inside 

nothing but busted glass.”  Later in the text, Zampanò describes a scenario where 

Navidson’s abusive father batters the family car with a thermos, another coincidence that 

the reader can hardly ignore.  Truant and Zampanò’s text space aren’t the only ones 

violated in this book, however.  Supposedly Navidson’s first film centered around an 

illusion in which he films a house and a hallway inside of it that is clearly longer than the 

external structure would permit. 

  With this constantly twisting narration, Danielewski involves and toys with his reader.  

House of Leaves keeps the reader guessing who is telling the truth and who to believe.
