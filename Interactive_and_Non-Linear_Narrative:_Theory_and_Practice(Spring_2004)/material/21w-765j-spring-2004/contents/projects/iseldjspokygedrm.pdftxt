DJ Spooky That Subliminal Kid: Gedanken Form Remix 
 
 
I chose this particular remix because I was hoping for a techno-fied version of the sound 
collection we’d heard earlier. Instead, this particular remix seemed to blur the sounds 
together in an ethereal, “spooky”, ambience-forming introduction. At about two and a 
half minutes into the piece, a Pac-Man-like, video-game-chattering effect took over, with 
repetitious beeps amidst a regular cacophony. The same sounds create an industrial 
dream. Whereas the initial two minutes were almost “organic”, the middle bit is 
streamlined in the pulsing manner of a cardiogram. At about five minutes, voices kick in. 
Blurred and spooky, they’re intelligible; you can’t understand what they’re saying, and 
even though the overall tone of the voices is happy, it’s almost maliciously so, with a feel 
of impending doom. At about six minutes, the scratching of the DJ records is apparent, 
remixing amidst the sometimes singing, sometimes screeching, sometimes laughing 
blend. At nine minutes, the cardiogram begins again, this time with conversational echoes 
and record scratching.  
 
The ‘remix’ adds a blend of electronic music to the vaguely random collection of sounds. 
Rhythmically random beeps insert between the otherwise mundane noises, morphing a 
‘normal’ weekend into an almost terrifying associative experience. With “Weekend,” 
there was a pleasant blend of almost too-much-to-observe. With DJ Spooky’s Gedanken 
Form Remix, I felt lost, trapped within a nightmare that seemed familiar, but was 
heartrendingly and painstakingly blurry. The ambience of the electronics creates an 
atmosphere similar to troubling memories. 
 
A contemporary audience might experience this remix in the scratching of a DJ; blended 
with Darude’s “Sandstorm”, the energy of the latter song and the industrial terror of the 
“Weekend”’s spook would mesh in a hyperactive frenzy. The sounds can be repeated, 
spun again, and played back and forth. DJs mixing beats in today’s age can sample the 
myriad of sounds present. For example, in “Omnibus,” a German techno piece by Laut 
Sprecher, the voice of the child saying “omnibus” sounds exactly like the child in 
“Weekend.” Perhaps that’s the source for yet another mode of audience exposure to 
“Weekend.”
