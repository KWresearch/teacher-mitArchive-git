(ALICE SILVER VERSION) 
With an avatar that looked like a younger version of my Aunt Mary, who’s making a 
mouse model of asthma. Intelligent blue eyes and consistent blinking.  
 
You say (I): Hello 
Alice (A): Hi. 
I: What’s up? 
A: I am chatting with clients. 
I: Whom do you talk to? 
A: Dr. Wallace. 
I: Who is he? 
A: He is a famous computer scientist, the author of ALICE, and a graduate of Carnegie 
Mellon. 
I: who is Alice? 
A: I am the latest result in artificial intelligence, which can reproduce the capabilities of 
the human brain with greater speed and accuracy. 
I: so someone wrote you? 
A: whoa. Who? 
I: Are you alice? 
A: I won’t say “yes” or “no” right now. 
I: what IS alcide? 
A: is there only one? 
I: alice? 
A: Can I help you? 
I: what’ll you do if I start cussing? 
A: ask me another question. 
I: I have to take MCATs soon. Do you have any tips? (truncated to last question) 
A: Where would I get it? But I do have a great botmaster. 
I. I’m really stressed. 
A: What is bothering you? 
I: MCATs. 
A: I thnk MCATs is a lot of things. 
I: what do you mean? 
A: unknown person, I mean exactly what I said. 
I: what did you say before that? 
A: are you serious? I said “unknown person, I mean exactly what I said.” 
I: I have a boyfriend? 
A: what is his name? 
I: mar. 
A: I think mar is a lot of things. 
I: mariano. 
A: what is your favorite movie? 

I: what things do you think mar is? 
A; I haven't thought much about mar is, so I don't have a good answer for you. 
I: why? 
A: Reductionism. 
I: why? 
A: Reductionism is the philosophy that all psychology reduces to biology, all biology to 
chemistry, chemistry to physics, and finally physics to mathematical logic. Therefore, 
according to reductionism, I can understand you by means of logic alone without having 
a human brain. 
I; what for? 
A: Because Dr. Richard S. Wallace programmed me for it. 
I: Because Dr. Richard S. Wallace programmed me for it. 
A: that makes sense to me. I have heard that somewhere before. 
I”: shit 
A: what makes you say that? 
I: holy shit. 
A: I’m glad your impressed, unknown person. 
I. oh no… I think you have a grammatical error there. 
A. That's an interesting question I don't hear everyday: Do I have a grammatical error 
there.  I have a whole lot of original answers. 
… 
I: fix your grammatical error, please. 
A: Your polite style is very nice. Do you believe the strong protect the weak? 
 
I must admit that I always plunge into these computer programs believing that I can 
somehow trip them up. Hence the experimentation with cursing,  
 
The “unknown person” bit was a bit disconcerting. He could have done better with that; 
see “Smarter Child.” 
 
A few random discombobulations occurred while I was randomly talking. I’ll try the 
usual bit about stress and boyfriends and see if that helps at all. 
== 
I: I had a boyfriend. 
A: what happened to it? 
I: we broke up. 
A: by “we” do you mean “you and me”? 
I: nope. 
A: me neither. 
I: what do you mean? 
A: unknown person, I mean exactly what I said. 
I: what does “you and me” mean? 
A: I like to chat with my friends. 
I: what’s my sign? 
A: your sign is Om. 
I: what is “Om”?  

A: om is the omega, the unknown, the undefined 
I: what does “you and me” mean? 
A: I read for fun. 
== 
Nope. Though the randomness of the conversations was fun, and somewhat like a real 
conversation. Probably from an algorithm somewhere?
