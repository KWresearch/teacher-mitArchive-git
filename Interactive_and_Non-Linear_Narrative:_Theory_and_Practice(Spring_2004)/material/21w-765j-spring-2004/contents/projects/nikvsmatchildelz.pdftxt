Tokyo: 

The capital and largest city of Japan, in east-central Honshu on Tokyo Bay, an inlet of the Pacific Ocean. �
Founded in the 12th century as Edo, Tokyo became the imperial capital in 1868. Much of the city was �
destroyed by an earthquake in 1923 and by bombing raids during World War II. Population: 8,080,286.�
Word history�
The names of Japan's first and current capitals, Kyoto and Tokyo, appear to us to be made up of the �
same two elements reversed, but in fact they have only one element in common. The elements of T*-ky* �
are old borrowings from Middle Chinese: t* means "east" and ky* means "capital," so together they �
mean "east(ern) capital." Chinese has another word for "capital," pronounced d*, whose Middle Chinese �
ancestor was borrowed into Japanese as to,"capital, large city." This is found in the name Kyoto, which �
was Japan's capital from 794 to 1192. The first part of Ky*to, ky*, is in fact the same word for "capital" �
found in Tokyo. Ky*to thus means "capital city." �

Next time, just type "define tokyo."�

Hunter at MIT: define kyoto�

Kyoto:�

A city of west-central Honshu, Japan, north-northeast of Osaka. Founded in the eighth century, it has �
long been a cultural, artistic, and religious center. Kyoto was Japan's capital from 794 until 1869, �
although its political importance declined after the rise of the shoguns (1192). Population: 1,452,240.�

Hunter at MIT: define okinawa�
SmarterChild: Definition provided by The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, �
Fourth Edition. Copyright © 2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Other important copyright �
information here.�

Okinawa:�

An island group of the central Ryukyu Islands in the western Pacific Ocean southwest of Japan. In �
World War II Okinawa, the largest island in the group, was the scene of fierce combat between the �
Japanese and U.S. Army and Marine forces (April 1-June 21, 1945). The islands were returned to the �
Japanese in 1972.�

Hunter at MIT: do you know about something positive?�
SmarterChild: Gosh, I dunno... I don't think I know about something positive.�
