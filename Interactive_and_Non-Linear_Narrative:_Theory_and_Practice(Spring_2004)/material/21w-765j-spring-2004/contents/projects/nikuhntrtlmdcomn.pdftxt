From what I can discern from Goldenberg’s diagram, the roots in oral tradition 
of the Talmud makes presenting it as a standard written text, that is, one with 
a linear progression of thoughts and ideas that are developed in some sort of 
logical progression, is near impossible to do.  What the written Talmud then 
becomes is a work that one can not fully comprehend without knowing it in its 
entirety.  This is not to say that wisdom cannot be gleaned from particular 
passages, but one cannot understand the all of the connections without knowing 
where they all lead.  
The consequences of reading the Talmud then might be an increased ability to 
retain information for referencing purposes, as it becomes always necessary to 
know where you are and where the place that you are is referenced.  In standard 
texts, as defined above, it is easy enough to forget where you came from because 
by that point, it is presumed that you have gleaned the logic of whatever 
universe the text presents.  By contrast, the Talmud’s interconnectedness makes 
it much more difficult to draw a straight path between all the things you know.  
And thus, since you are unable to string all those things together in a neat 
line, it forces you to retain more of it in order to maintain your fully 
understanding.
