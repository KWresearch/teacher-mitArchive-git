Interactive and Non-Linear Narrative: Theory and Practice
21W.765J, 21L.489J, CMS.845

Assignment 1:

1) Read Vannevar Bush’s “As we may think” in the Atlantic Monthly, July
1945. On-line version can be found at:
http://www.isg.sfu.ca/~duchier/misc/vbush/

Write a brief comment on Bush’s article by addressing the following
questions:
• Bush is considered the ‘father’ of hypertext although he did not coin the
term. To what extend can we see his concept implemented in the
WorldWideWeb that for many people now defines their notion of hypertext?
What are the differences? Compared to the WWW, which aspects in Bush’s
concept are more far reaching, where does he fall short?
• What would be your vision for dealing with complex content?

2) Analyze the linear and circular narrative structure of L’île aux fleurs in
conjunction with the translated transcript. How does the filmmaker use
images to evoke associations that lie outside the film’s narrative? How does
the ending fit the narrative structure of the rest of the film? You can either
write a brief comment or make a drawing of the structure.

3) Read Jorge Luis Borges: “The Garden of the Forking Paths” and “The
Library of Babel.” Come prepared to class to discuss the multiple
perspectives in Borges’s stories.
