• Metamorphoses
– Ovid’s Metamorphoses is a collection of stories 
from ancient Roman mythology where characters 
have morphed into different beings
– Gods, goddesses and nymphs are responsible for 
these abnormal changes
– Stories are in chronological order
– Individual gods and goddesses are involved in 
several disconnected episodes

• Game Idea
– Avatar: god/goddess
– Object: explore worlds, pick up clues, and interact with other 
characters to perform tasks (morphing a person into something 
else); overall goal is to perform all tasks in all stories/episodes
– Nonlinear aspect: each god/goddess has tasks to perform, but 
they are not dependent on each other, therefore they may be 
performed in any order
– After you have completed tasks for given god, you take on 
identity of another god and continue playing
– Sequence of episodes is connected to previous character 
played, but is not predetermined -> multiple/parallel 
narratives
