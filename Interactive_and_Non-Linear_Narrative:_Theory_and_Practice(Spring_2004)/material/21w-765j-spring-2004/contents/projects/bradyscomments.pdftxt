Janet Murray discusses digital narrative as being “spatial.” She uses the text based game 
Zork as an example of how the user can navigate around a virtual space by typing go 
North, go South, and so on. 
 
She points out that this “spatial” property is not due to the computer’s ability to process 
and display three-dimensional models.  Zork didn’t even have graphics.  The spatial 
quality of the game arises from the user’s interaction with the interface and painting their 
own environment from the clues the computer feeds them.  The Zork code never held any 
actual model of what the environment looked like or how it worked, it only had blocks of 
text (“you are in a dungeon”)that were connected a system of textual commands (“go 
north”.) 
 
On a lower level, this illustrates the same process that occurs with soundscapes such as 
Ruttmann’s “Weekend.”  The work is a series of sounds spliced together, which does not 
hold a model or map of a city.  Through the listener’s interaction and imagination with 
the track, an entire city can be illustrated.
