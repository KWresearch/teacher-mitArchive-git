I spent awhile trying to figure out what the difference was.  I was very tired, so I'm going 
to try again.  For a while I was thinking it might be material that was from the same 
source, but just not used in the original piece.  Before that I was tryingto come up with a 
tone difference.  Part of the problem as well is that I never understood a narrative from 
the original.  Will try again.
