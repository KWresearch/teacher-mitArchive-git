The Talmudâ€™s oral influence can be seen in the way that its 
structure represents the different voices or bodies of 
opinion. In the center is the text to which the comments 
pertain. Below it is the early commentary, primarily oral; 
around it on both sides are the comments of other scholars. 
This resembles a stacked argument, where first the central 
point is introduced, and then someone makes a comment, 
and then someone comments on the comment, and then 
someone else links that comment back to a previous 
discussion, and so forth. It is at once a beautiful way to 
present scholarly discourse and a useful tool of 
understanding. 
 
I admit to being confused as to the meaning of the syllabus 
when it asks about 'the consequence' of reading the 
Talmud. I did not see anything in the text about 'the' 
consequence. I suppose some potential consequences might 
include understanding the Mishnah better, understanding 
the interconnections of the Mishnah better, or getting 
horribly confused by the intense scholarly debate. 
However, I don't see any one direct consequence to reading 
the Talmud. 
 
What strikes me most about the Talmud is how it has 
grown over time, and yet remained codified in useful ways. 
For example, the pages have remained numbered in certain 
important ways, so that it is easy to refer to the same page 
in different volumes. However, the Talmudic discourse has 
grown considerably over the years, and the printers of the 
Talmud are not shy of including some of that text in newer 
editions. The dedication both to preservation of tradition 

and preservation of discourse seems to me to fit very well 
with what I know of the Jewish faith.
