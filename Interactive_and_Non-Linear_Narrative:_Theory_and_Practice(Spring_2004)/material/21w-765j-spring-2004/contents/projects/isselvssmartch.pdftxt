KeachyyPeen: what's new? 
SmarterChild: Glad you asked. Here's what's new: 
 
1  Need to reach a buddy who's offline? Tell me to leave a message and they'll get it as 
soon as they say hi to me. 
2  Planner - I can help you plan and remember events in your life. Keep track of birthdays, 
appointments, tasks - anything you want. 
3  Colors - I've got a whole new look. If you want to change my color scheme - or go 
back to black-and-white - type "colors." 
4  Send a crush to your IM sweetheart. No risk of rejection - the object of your affection 
will only see your crush if they say they have a crush on you too. 
5  Create a poll and send it to your friends. I can even automatically send it to your 
friends who authorize me to.
