Reading the Classic Jewish Texts, Barry Holtz 
 
 
It strikes me that the Talmud, in both its structure and its content, is a web of 
intertwined and sometimes contradictory opinions all tied together. This may be a result 
of the seemingly pressing need to include every opinion of well-known Rabbis of the 
past and to capture the traditions of Jewish ancestors.  
Because the Talmud is a collection of commentaries about previous 
commentaries about previous commentaries etc., it clearly is a result of a very strong 
oral tradition. I ask myself what the original scripture was that set this chain of 
commentaries going. Was it the Holy Bible? Looking at the sample page of the Talmud, 
given in the reading, I realize that the Bible takes up the least amount of space on the 
page.  

Yet there is much to learn about the values and traditions of the Jewish religion 
by the structure of the Talmud. The mishnah and gemara lie on the center of the page 
with a series of commentaries such as Tosafot and Rashi framing the central text. This 
framing, or nesting, of ideas seems to clutter the page, suggesting that in the oral 
tradition of the religion, there have been many different figures who have interpreted the 
scriptures in differing, maybe even opposing, ways. It is interesting that all of these 
figures in history have been given a place in the Talmud, even if their opinions may have 
contradicted other leaders’ opinions. This brings up the question of hierarchy. I admit 
that as I read the glossary, which is usually a good tool for clarifying different ideas, I 
was finding it difficult to differentiate different texts. Many of the texts were defined as 
very important or widely respected and it was difficult to follow which ones are more 
important to whom and why. For example, the Rashi is described as the “’heart’ of the 
study of the Talmud”(139). However, on the page, it is not the central text and is only 
one of the framing commentaries. In reality, there is probably no definite hierarchy 
among the texts because, as in many religions, there are different branches within the 
Jewish tradition that believe slightly different things. Therefore, because of the oral 
tradition and the mix of several ideas, the Talmud may be the only uniting piece among 
sects in the Jewish religion. 
 
In addition to the structure of the Talmud, its content also is evidence of its strong 
oral tradition. Certain texts not only contradict each other but go off on tangents. The 
Tosefta is described as commentaries that are “unpredictable in sequence”(137). 
Because several of these texts were not recorded through writing, it is probably true that 
they were modified, expanded and branched off from the original works through the oral 
tradition. Consequently, the many texts in the Talmud sometimes contradict each other 
and there may be many versions of similar core ideas. Ultimately, the Talmud is 
structured for deep study and provides a way for the user to read several interpretations 
at once of similar topics. However, I worry that the user may depend so much on the 
material and be intimidated by the amount and content of the text, that s/he may be 
dissuaded to pursue study of the Talmud. In fact, I fear that s/he may depend so much 
on other interpretations of the scriptures that s/he may not have the capacity to interpret 
them him/herself.
