L’île aux fleurs uses a repetitive, looping structure to expose his points.  The filmmaker 
repeatedly returns to the same concepts, but each time strikes out from those concepts 
along a new path of meaning.  Having explored the concepts from many angles, he 
finishes with the angle of freedom.  It fits his previous narrative structure in its free-
associative feel, even though the film has not explored freedom explicitly before.
