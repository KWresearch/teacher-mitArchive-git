Issel’s Comments on Janet Murray’s article 
 
Janet Murray claims that four properties belong to modern-day media narratives: they are 
procedural, participatory, spatial, and encyclopedic.  
 
In Jorge Furtado’s “Ilha das Flores,” the narrative explores various connections by 
providing a vast spatial forum. The movie runs from trivial associations with a tomato to 
the garbage produced by interacting with a tomato, eventually leading us to the Island of 
the Flowers. 
 
The flurried juxtaposition of random images maximizes the spatial realm covered by the 
movie. Though intrinsically leading us to the island and “freedom” as the final physical 
and mental destinations, the movie covers a vast amount of space. We, as the audience, 
journey from a tomato field to ancient history to a perfume factory, and eventually end up 
at a pig farm on a little-known island. The format of nonlinear narrative, especially that 
which is present in modern-day media, allows viewers or users to navigate successfully 
through the artist’s thoughts and patterns. The juxtapositions create a new dimension, a 
mental space that forms a level of associations, leading to deeper meanings that hone the 
artwork into viewers’ hearts.
