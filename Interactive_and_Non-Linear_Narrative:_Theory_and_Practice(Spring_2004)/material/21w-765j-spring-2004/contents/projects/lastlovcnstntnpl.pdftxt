Last Love in Constantinople by Milorad Pavic is a nonlinear novel whose 

structure revolves around the reading of tarot cards.  There are 21 tarot cards and 21 

corresponding chapters in addition to a special card and chapter.  The book comes with 

instructions for 3 different tarot card reading methods to read a person's past present and 

future: The Magic Cross which focuses on the present, The Celtic Cross which focuses 

on the past and future, and The Great Triad which equally balances all three.  The 22 

cards are to be shuffled every which way, cut, and put into a layout specified by the 

specific reading method.  Afterwards, the cards are turned over in a specified order one 

by one.  Every card has a short meaning attached to it, and if the card comes up upside-

down it means approximately the opposite of what it means right side up.  After reading 

the description, the reader can read the corresponding chapter that provides a short story 

with which the reader can associate.  At the same time, a story outside of the tarot reading 

begins to form, since the chapters are all snippets in the lives of the same few characters. 

Last Love in Constantinople’s structure provides an innovative way of story 

telling that engages the reader.  Since the reader is expecting the tarot cards to reveal 

something about their past, present, and/or future, he looks especially hard for details of 

the story that he can associate with.  For example, one of the main characters, Lieutenant 

Sofronije Opujic, is one of power and is often involved in some kind of love or 

relationship.  When looking for something in their past present and future, these two 

topics are usually thought about and it is likely that the author writes about these often for 

that very reason. 

When I read the book, I attempted to read my fortune using The Great Triad 

layout.  It’s funny how much my attitude about my fortune affected how much I would 

relate to the story.  Often times the fortunes are vague enough that they can apply to 

anyone, which is one of the keys to pulling the reader into the story, however I think 

being aware of this fact detracted from my experience in reading the book.  It was fun to 

think that it could reveal something about my life though, as there was no harm in trying 

to apply it to my past and present – however I tend to take the future cards less seriously, 

because it is stupid to expect things to happen. 

Most of the chapters seemed to build on each other very well, however some of 

them seemed to be very disconnected.  If the book is read the way it is supposed to be, 

then most readers will only get parts of the entire book, which would leave it up to the 

reader to extrapolate and assume things outside of the story.  The order the cards are read 

in also adds an extra dimension to the story; are you introduced to Sofronije Opujic when 

he is already married?... or when he is in his fiery days of youth.  It is likely that the 

different first impressions readers get of each character greatly affect the readers 

disposition to that character. 

Last Love in Constantinople is a unique novel with multiple layers of story 

building and association in both the novel and the reader and is a more entertaining and 

engaging way of telling a story than most linear novels.  It is a great example of the way a 

nonlinear narrative can engage the reader, and I had a good time experiencing this book.
