Commentary on Iser 
 
Anticipation and retrospection often happens when I read some piece more than 
once.  It mainly comes from the fact that upon second reading, I'm already 
familiar with the plot and am able to focus on other aspects of the novel.  For 
instance, the first time I read "Portrait of a Lady," I was shocked by the twist 
in the book (when it was revealed that Osmond's daughter was actually Madame 
Merle's).  I was right there with the main character (Isabel) was.  Upon a 
second read a few years later, I read the book again.  On second reading, I 
picked up on hints in the novel that foreshadowed the twist.  So when the twist 
occurred, I was no longer surprised by it, and at the same time, I felt less 
sorry for Isabel.  It also made me reflect more on the motivation behind Madame 
Merle and Osmond Gilbert's behavior.  In some ways, I was able to understand 
their motivations a lot more than before.  In addition, I always get advanced 
retrospection, maybe even on a first read.  Since I'm a very visual person, I 
always like to form vague ideas about what the characters look like.  But 
whenever I see a movie version of that book, I'm always shocked by how different 
the character is from the one I had imagined.
