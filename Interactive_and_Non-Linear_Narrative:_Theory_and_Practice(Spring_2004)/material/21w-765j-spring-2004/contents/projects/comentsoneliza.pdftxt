Comment: 
The manifestation version was easier to converse with.  When Eliza was able to 
rephrase my  
 
questions in a different way, it increased the sense of verisimilitude. 
 
What was believable was when Eliza asked me whether I wished I was so 
understanding.  It would  
 
be something that a sarcastic friend might say to me.  It was amusing when Eliza 
called me  
 

negative whenever I said no.  There was not a lot of comprehension, but there 
seemed to be a  
 
little with manifestation.  The discussion with Eliza about being my new best 
friend had some  
 
level of comprehension to it.
