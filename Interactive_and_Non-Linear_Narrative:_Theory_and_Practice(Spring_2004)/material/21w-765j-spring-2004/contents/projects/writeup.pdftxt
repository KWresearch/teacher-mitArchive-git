Final Project 
 
 
Imagine the world of the “Hitchhiker's Guide” crossed with “Men in Black.”  You 
are an agent on Earth charged with keeping alien emigrants in line, and after an incident 
with a quantum-polarized-ray, have just been assigned to police Russia.  Only problem: 
you lost your issued babel fish and your ID upon arrival, and Quargons are threatening 
war, effectively shutting down borders and communication.  You are stranded, you can't 
speak or understand the language, and just to spice things up, there are a lot of people 
(and aliens) who would be delighted to kill you, if they find out who and where you are. 
 
The user of the game will be able to move around the environment, which 
depending on complexity would include 3D representations of one or more cities in 
Russia, and likely parts of the countryside.  Items can be found or purchased, but many of 
these will have a repeated and incidental purpose.  That is, if you don't pick up that can of 
Coke, it won't prevent the game from going on, but you also won't have the opportunity 
to throw it at Begure, who deserves it ;>  The user can talk to anyone, though whether 
they can gain useful information is up for grabs.  Some natives will only speak Russian, 
some will speak English as well, some aliens will be very friendly and help translate, 
some aliens will not be friendly and try to deceive the user.  On the whole, the point of 
the game is to immerse the user in a world with multiple objectives (capture some aliens, 
give information to others, find a babel fish, get in communication with headquarters... 
etc)  Few are dependant on others.  Thus, you don't need to get a babel fish, but certainly 
life would be easier if you do. 
 
Detailed conception would need to be additive, so we'll start at the core: 
The game opens as the user gets off the plane.  A sketchy individual bumps into the main 
character, and he/she discovers that his/her identification, babel fish, and much weaponry 
is now gone.  Ouch.  There's a bookseller nearby, so picking up a Russian/English 
dictionary is possible.  The user can then try and find someone who speaks English, or try 
to communicate in Russian, or just leave and hope for better times ahead outside of the 
airport.  The main character, who for brevity will be known as Bob, has a list of stated 
objectives.  There are some individuals in hiding he needs to check in with, some 
criminals who need to be captured (or vaporized), some humans who might have 
information for you...  There is a retired agent, and Bob has his number and address, so 
that might be a good place to start, though certainly isn't necessary.  There will be 
multiple ways to end (besides dying or going insane) without having completed all the 
objectives.  For example, you can go through without a babel fish, especially if the user 
does speak Russian, but for an English speaker the babel fish might be almost necessary 
to avoid hideous confusion, so that would be one of the first tasks tackled.  It's also 
possible to forget the objectives all together, and just try and get home, in which case a 
'criminal' or two might be helpful, so long as you agree to get them cleared of all charges. 
 
Characters in the game will have specific objectives, contrary or complementary 
to Bob's.  Some are human, some are aliens, some don't even know aliens are on the 
planet.  There are a couple characters who might want to be recruited into the agency, or 
who might follow around Bob under the misconception that he is looking for a  wife.  
They will help in many ways (navigation, translation) but also hinder Bob regarding 
speed, trust of certain other individuals... 
 
The game is ambitious, but serves many purposes.  On the one hand it can be 

played as a highly interactive game in the vein of what Douglas Adams originally 
wanted.  Random small plots provide entertainment and immersion within the game, so 
the user is encouraged to explore the full range of what the game designers came up with.  
It thus also replicates what it would be like to be in this situation, rather than having a 
game where the environment is there simply to hold the series of events and puzzles that 
need to be solved to complete the game.  On the other hand, this is a tool to learn 
Russian.  A translation book would be a tool that can be pulled up, (though of course any 
translation materials in the real world can also be used), which is good perhaps for mid-
competence speakers.  All conversations will be spoken as well as textually recorded.  
Characters will answer questions about what certain things mean.  One character is even 
an English teacher and can help explain the grammar.  Basically, there will be numerous 
tools for learning Russian, such that the user can figure out what's going on and keep 
going through the game, learning bits as they go along, rather than having to know 
Russian from the get-go.  But it is also easy to play the game without learning any 
Russian at all, so frustration levels should be very low.  Instead, it provides a fun way to 
learn Russian if the user so desires, as well as a fun game.
