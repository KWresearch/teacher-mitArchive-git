We see in hypertext the ability to aggregate data much as Mr. Bush suggests.  The “trails” of which he 
speaks don’t quite match up to the links and bookmarks of our World Wide Web, but the intent is similar: 
to provide a means of navigating through the vast body of material in a meaningful way.  In our World 
Wide Web, we send each other meaningful URLs instead of photographs of our trails.  Also, rather than 
each of us having our own set of trails which we must exchange by means of duplication and re-entering of 
the data, we all refer to a common set of trails, to which we cam add at any time. 
 
Unfortunately, unlike Mr. Bush’s vision, trails do degrade and fail over time.  Pages move, accounts are 
disabled, ISPs go under, and over time, what was a vibrant trail of information becomes a ghostly land of 
“this page has moved” and “404: Document Not Found”.  It is a sad thing, this loss of information, and one 
that Mr. Bush’s vision explicitly prevented. 
 
My vision for complex content is much more like the Wikis and blogs of today.  They would use the World 
Wide Web format so familiar to us, but would be editable by anyone.  Anyone could add a link from one 
page to another, or pride comments on the posted material.
