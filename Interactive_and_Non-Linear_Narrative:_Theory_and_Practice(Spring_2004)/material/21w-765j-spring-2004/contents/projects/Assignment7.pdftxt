Assignment 7:

1) 

2) 

3) 

Compare Walter Ruttmann’s original radio play “Weekend” with one of the
Remixes on our shared site. All of the Remixes relate to the original in
different ways and put their sound material into a different context while
maintaining the overall narrative structure that spans one weekend.
Attach your short comments directly to the remix file on the shared site.
In your comments, please include the following aspects:
• Does the Remix add a new dimension to the narrative structure and the
soundscape of the original? If so in what way?
• To what extent makes the Remix Ruttmann’s piece more accessible to a
contemporary audience?

Come to class with ideas for an audio project that either:
• uses original sounds to form a narrative or a soundscape (see also the
Metropolis projects about Vienna, Munich, and Cologne/Kyoto on our
shared site)
• explores spoken non-linear narratives in a shared environment
• combines written and spoken narratives to form a coherent experience

For next class:
Read Lev Manovich’s essay on the database in the Forms chapter of “The
Language of New Media”, page 213-243 (on our shared site)
Come prepared to class to discuss his approach in relationship to the
literary works and films that we have discussed in class so far and, of
course, your first group projects.
