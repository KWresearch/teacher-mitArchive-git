Metamorphoses game 
 
 
For my final project, I decided to take one of my favorite ancient texts, 
Ovid’s Metamorphoses, and adapt it to a video game format.  The main 
challenges in creating a video game from a work such as this are interpreting 
the author’s metaphorical language, selecting which myths/episodes to 
include, and deciding how these episodes can be related to create a narrative. 
 
 
The proposed game has six different avatars: Apollo, Jove, Hermes, 
Minerva, Juno and Diana.  Each avatar has different episodes to play out and 
worlds to explore.  A player may choose which god/goddess to play at first and 
may go on to another avatar without completing all of his/her tasks.  However, 
in order to win the game, the player must play out all episodes for all six 
different avatars.  In addition, the episodes are played out in no particular 
order.  And therefore, the nonlinearity of the episodes mimics the timelessness 
of the myths themselves. 
 
 
There are several functions/tools that the interface provides in order to 
help the player complete his/her tasks.  There is a map tool, which allows the 
player to find out information about different places and be able to 
instantaneously travel to new destinations.  The powers tool, tells the player 
what powers that particular god has and allows him/her to try them out.  The 
talking tool allows the player to communicate with several other characters in 
the game, and finally the archive/help tool gives the player access to a 
collection of texts, artwork, Latin vocabulary and help from Ovid himself.  
These resources are meant to enhance the gaming experience and motivate 
players to explore their worlds.  In addition, they serve and educational 
purpose by teaching players about history, art, mythology, Latin, and many 
other things. 
 
 
After rereading the majority of the book, I was able to select the myths 
that I wanted to include in the game.  However, this was the most challenging 
aspect of the game design because I had to find a correlation between the 
myths and they had to be engaging enough to adapt to a video game.  Although 
the details of the game-play and inter-character interaction are not complete, 
I believe that the structure in the screenshots I created demonstrate the 
flexibility and depth that these categories could have.  In addition, the colors, 
menus, and narration details that are illustrated in the screenshots are quite 
accurate with what I had in mind. 
 
 
Finally, I think that this game has a great deal of potential as an indirect 
educational tool.  The different gods’ powers’ and the idea of exploration are 

consistent with the arguments of Jenkins and Murray in the reading.  Jenkins 
argues that the richness of the environments creates the motivation to play.  
Murray emphasizes that the “pleasure factor” of games is the spatial aspect of 
the game.  The strength of Metamorphoses is that game-play is dependent on 
thorough exploration of microworlds and given resources.  Therefore, it is 
consistent with their arguments and I am confident that the proposed game 
would be both exciting and educational for an audience of high schoolers and 
up. 
 
My work in the screenshots was on the interface design and elements, and 
image editing.
