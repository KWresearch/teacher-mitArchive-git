L’île aux fleurs, Jorge Furtado 
 
 
The film, L’île aux fleurs can be considered both a linear and a circular 
narrative. As the film develops, new characters/objects are introduced that are 
immediately described in a straightforward manner and are thus put into context. 
In this way, the film could be considered linear because each new idea is 
introduced and explained in order to present and describe the final idea, 
freedom. 
 
However, this form of narrative can also be considered circular because 
one idea is not necessarily dependant on the other. The idea of freedom is in no 
obvious way dependant on a tomato. 
 
The film builds up on previous ideas quite nicely. One example is in the 
description of a human being. Initially human beings are described as 
“mammals…with highly developed encephalon and the opposing thumb”(slide 5). 
Later on a human being is described as having “a highly developed encephalon, 
an opposing thumb and money”(slide 53). When women and children are 
introduced, they are described as having “no money”(slide 64). Finally human 
beings are “distinguished from other animals for the highly developed 
encephalon, the opposing thumb and the fact of being free”(slide 74). This 
example builds up on ideas that are fully described throughout the film. However, 
there are some ideas that are brought up, but because they are not pertinent to 
the goal of describing freedom, are not included in the film. One example is 
gravy. Although the narrator describes pork and tomatoes quite vividly, he does 
not explain gravy.  
It is interesting to see what he does and does not choose to describe. For 
instance, what does knowing the difference between a Japanese person, a Jew 
and a Christian have to do with freedom? I would argue that the film is making a 
statement about man’s enslavement and therefore his lack of freedom. He is 
showing that man is bound to certain needs such as money that are man-made. 
He is also bound to his origins, race, sex, age, family and society. The images 
chosen for the film are especially powerful in this aspect. When describing Jews, 
images of the holocaust appear on the screen, juxtaposed with cute images of 
hens and whales on a scale in the following slide. There are also some very 
powerful sentences that stand out in the midst of the countless simplified 
descriptions of objects and people. “To remember is to live”(slide 61) and “The 
profit…today is FREE for all human beings”(slide 30) are two examples.  
Therefore, because the filmmaker chose very precise ideas to describe 
and included several hints about freedom, I would consider the film a circular 
narrative. Although the ultimate goal of the film may be to describe freedom, it 
does so in a non-linear manner by describing the opposite of freedom.
