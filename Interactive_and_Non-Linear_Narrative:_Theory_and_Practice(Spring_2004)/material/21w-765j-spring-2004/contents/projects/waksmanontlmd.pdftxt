I find it very amusing that in being presented with the Talmud 
we are given a 10 page (9 if you don't count the cover) document 
an only a small fraction of one page is actually a readable form 
of the Talmud. The hebrew page from the Talmud is not being 
 
presented for the purposes of reading, but simply to illustrate 
the page layout. In fact, the vast majority of the document that 
we have is an explanation and description of the Talmud. 
 
That we are provided with an explanation instead of the core 
document itself might initially seem a little odd, but in 
understanding the essence of the Talmud it becomes clear. As it 
is described, the Talmud is an ever changing, evolving document 
that consists of a core text surrounded by many layers of 
analysis and description. If we then take the view that the 
document we are provided with is not just a description of the 
Talmud but rather an expansion on it, then we see that the 9 
pages we are provided with are in fact all a part of the Talmud. 
 
In being a separate and distint document, the description of the 
Talmud has become one and the same as the Talmud itself. For 
that matter, it becomes impossible for any idea that relates to 
the Talmud to not be considered a part of it.
