***** Course Description *****
This course explores the properties of non-linear, multi-linear, and
interactive forms of narratives as they have evolved from print to digital
media. Works covered in this course range from the Talmud, classics of non-
linear novels, experimental literature, early sound and film experiments to
recent multi-linear and interactive films and games. The study of the
structural properties of narratives that experiment with digression, multiple
points of view, disruptions of time, space, and of storyline is complemented by
theoretical texts about authorship/readership, plot/story, properties of
digital media and hypertext. Questions that will be addressed in this course
include: How can we define 'non-linearity/multi-linearity', 'interactivity',
'narrative'. To what extend are these aspects determined by the text, the
reader, the digital format? What kinds of narratives are especially suited for
a nonlinear/ interactive format? Are there stories that can only be told in a
digital format? What can we learn from early non-digital examples of non-linear
and interactive story telling?
