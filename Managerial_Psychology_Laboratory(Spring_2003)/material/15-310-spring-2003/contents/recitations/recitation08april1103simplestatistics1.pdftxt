Describing a state

– Descriptive statistics 
– Capturing a picture of the 
data)
– This was the origin of statistics
– Started for gambling

Central tendencies
• Representing central 
tendencies of distributions is a 
very efﬁcient way to 
understand something about it.
• Mode
• Median
• Mean

The Mode

• The most “popular” frequent occurring 
instance in the sample.
– This is the only central tendency that can 
be used with a nominal scale
• The mode is sensitive to aggregation of 
categories
– Age 18 vs age 18-21
• Sometimes there are multiple modes
– Bimodal distributions

The Median

• The median is a value which 1/2 of the values 
are above it and 1/2 below
• After sorting the values by magnitude, the 
mode is at the (n+1)/2 location
• 123, 85, 34, 20, 18, 15, 14 ‹ 20
• 123, 85, 34, 20, 18, 15 ‹ (20 + 34)/2 = 27
• When data is grouped, calculating the mode is 
a bit more complex

The Mean

• Mean = (∑Xi) /n
• The most important statistic
• Used for many other computations
• Stable
– Smallest mean square deviations from it
• Sensitive to extreme values
• Not “well behaved’ in non-standard 
distributions

Distribution descriptors

• The Range
– The range is (Max - Min)
• Interquartile range
– Calculating is similar to median 
– Q3-Q1 (1/2 of the observations)

Variation I

• Variance (s^2)
– ∑(Xi-m)^2/(n) 
– ∑(Xi-m)^2/(n-1)
• Standard deviation (s)
– Square root of variance
– Standard deviation is in the same units 
as the distribution

Variation II

• Variance (s ^2) is:
• insensitive to transformations 
consisting of adding a constant.
• sensitive to transformations consisting 
of multiplying by a constant.

Describing scores:

Z scores
z = (r-m) / s
m = 0 , s = 1
T scores
m = 50 , s = 10
SAT, GRE etc.

Conﬁdence in estimates?

• How sure can we be that we know the 
mean of the distribution, for example?
• Standard error of the mean
– m^2 / Square root of N

The Correlation

• The relationship between 2 variables 
does not have to be linear
– But in many cases they are
• Positive and negative correlations

• What is the correlation here?

The correlations were:

• 1 ¯ 0.1
• 2 ¯ 0.3
• 3 ¯ 0.5
• 4 ¯ 0.7
• 5 ¯ 0.9
• 6 ¯ 0.99
• 7 ¯ 01

What is a correlation?

• What line to pick?
– Sum of all deviations from the line is 0
– The sum of square deviations of the points from the 
line is minimal.
• R = Sxy / Sx * Sy
– The relationship of their joint standard deviation 
to their individual standard deviation 
• R^2 is the amount of explained variance

Summary

One of the main usages of statistics is to 
describe data
Central tendencies: Mean, Mode, 
Median
Distribution tendencies: Variance, IQR, 
Correlations
