Probability theory presents a systematic 
way to think about such issues

Examples

Probability of:
A newborn will be male?
Getting HH in a coin toss?
Getting a particular face on a die?
In a bag with 1 red, 1 green and 3 blue 
balls. What is the probability to draw a red 
ball, a red or a blue ball?

Compound Probabilities

draw a red or a green ball?

• A dramatic disease causes death in 60% 
of the cases. Only 40% people survive.
• What is the likelihood that 10 out of 10 
people survive?

• Only one possible way to get 10 / 10…

of the cases. Only 40% people survive.
• What is the likelihood that (at least) 7 out 
of 10 people survive?

A bit more complex ...

Calculating bonomial probabilities
P(r out of n) = number of possible ways X 
Probability of each way
Number of possible ways = n!/[r!(n-r)!]
P(7 out of 10) = 
0.4^(r) x 0.6^(n-r) = 0.4^7 x 0.6^3 = 
0.00035389
10!/7!3!=120
P(7 out of 10) = 0.0425

7 or more out of 10?

7 out of 10 + 8 out of 10 + 9 out of 10 + 
10 out of 10

When we calculate the probability of an 
outcome (7), most times we calculate the 
probaility of the outcome or a more 
extreme outcome

Binomial summary

By using the binomial distribution we  
can directly calculate the probability of 
en event (or a more extreme event).

We can compare this probability to 0.05 
and decide if it is signiﬁcant or not.

Calculating distributions:

6 coins tossed:
 n = 6;   p = .5;   q = .5
Theoretical mean (m) = np = 6 * .5 = 3
central tendency of distribution
Variance (s^2) = n *p*q
Standard deviation = s
z = (r-m) / s

Z scores

z = (r-m) / s
Probability of 6 Heads:
z = (6-3) / 1.225 = 2.45

Look for  z = 2.45 in the Normal 
distribution table
