Inferential statistics, Why?

• Our measurements have error
– Random error
– Measurement error
– Intervening variables
– Etc.

Inferential statistics, Why?
• We want to make inferences beyond our 
sample
• Statistics organizes & set the “rules” by 
which we can draw conclusions
• We usually test things we think will 
“work”
– Statistics help protect us against 
ourselves

Going beyond descriptions

• The main issue is variance!
• The question we ask is how 
large or likely is the effect 
relative to the variance we 
have.  

Sampling & probability

• In Binomial distributions there are 
two possible outcomes.
– What is the probability for 5 boys
– What is the probability for 4 out 
of 5 being boys?
• P(r successes) = (n!/r!) * pr * qn-r

Hypothesis testing #1

• Using the binomial distribution
• If a family has 4 boys, are they 
likely to have a boy or girl next 
time?
• What about 5 or 6 boys? 

From binomial to normal

As N increases and p = q, 
the binomial becomes close 
to the normal

Another test

Usually 6% of MIT  students pass 
15.301.
At Sloan (out of 400 students) 42 
have passed 15.301.
Is this random?  Are the Sloan 
students better?

What do we need for an answer:

Expected mean (µ)= np
Variance (σ2) = npq
Z = (xi - µ) / σ
µ = 400*6/100 = 24; σ = 4.8
Z (41.5)  = (41.5 - 24)/4.8 = 3.64
Using the normal table, z = 3.64 = p 0.0001

Statistical tests

• T-test
• ANOVA
• Linear Regression
• Non-parametric tests

One sample t test
Mean diff
t = 
µ - M
√ ∑(xi - µ)2
n-1
Standard deviation

√ n 

What do you do with “t”

Compare it to the “t table”

When there is more data, the 
t distribution gets closer to 
normal

two samples t test

Test for independent samples
t = 
(µ1 - µ2) - (M1 - M2)
n1 σ12 + n2 σ22 ( n1 x  n2)
√
n1 +  n2
n1 + n2 -2

Example

Who eats more lollipops males of females?
7 females; 5 males followed for a month
Females: µ = 27, σ2 = 29.2
Males: µ = 19, σ2 = 24.57

Is there a difference?

Calculating ...

t = 
√

(27 - 19) - (0)
5 x 24.57 + 7 x 29.2 ( 5 x  7 )
5 +  7
5 + 7 -2
= 2.42

two samples t test

Test for dependent samples
t = (within diﬀ) - (expected diﬀ)
√n 
sd of diﬀ

Example

Does the sun creates freckles?
Each ss has one side of the body in the sun

H0 sun side ≤ non-sun side
H1 sun side > non-sun side
