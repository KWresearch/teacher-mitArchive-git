Experimental design 1

Experiments are the most common and

useful way to determine causality.


What is a good experiment?


Hard to say...

 Experiments are an art form!


But in general it is an experiment that control 
for everything else and tests just what you 
want it to test. 
Planned well in advance 
Controlling for other plausible hypotheses 

The ﬁrst experiment

An Early Experimental Design: “Dew it both ways” Judges (Shoftim) Chapter 6 

And Gideon said to G-d: 

“If You will save Israel by my hand, as You have said, look, I will put a ﬂeece of wool 
on the threshing-ﬂoor ; if there be dew on the ﬂeece only, and it be dry upon all 
the ground, then shall I know that You will save Israel by my hand, as You have 
said.” 

And it was so; for he rose up early on the next day, and pressed the ﬂeece 
together, and wrung dew out of the ﬂeece, a bowlful of water. 

And Gideon said to G-d: “Do not be angry with me, and I will speak just this once: 
let me try just once more, I ask You, with the ﬂeece; let it now be dry only upon 
the ﬂeece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.” 

And G-d did so that night; for it was dry upon the ﬂeece only, and there was dew 
on all the ground. 

An experiment vs. experiments 


Any experiment is a step in a dialog 
Experiments build on each other 
No experiment is the ultimate one 

The art of setting experiments


Industry standards 

Elegance 

Symmetry

Many ways to measure the same idea


What is convincing evidence?


Single cell designs 


Not an experiment -- a study 
Parameter estimations 
Theory test 
Examples econ, physics 
Creating a control group from the single cell 
Ordering simulation in seeking variety 

Random assignment


Random assignment is the central aspect of 
experiments 
By randomly assigning subjects to groups we 
can assume no systematic differences between 
groups 
Assume they are the same on everything but 
the manipulation. 

The importance of

manipulations 

By using a manipulation you can determine the 
direction of causality 

Based also on random assignment we can link 
the outcome to our manipulation
