Hypotheses testing I


Different things are different ! 
Why test them?  Can’t we just show mean 
difference? 
• No, because of randomness / chance 

Can we test that things are different? 
• Logically it is very hard -- because they are 

Variance 

Within vs. between

subject designs 

Which is better?  Why 
What are the advantages of each? 
What are the disadvantages of each? 

Hypotheses testing II


H0 (the null hypothesis)

H1(the real hypothesis) 


H0- No difference  Group 1 = Group 2

• [=, ≤, ≥] 

H1-Difference  Group 1 ≠ Group 2

• [≠, >, <] 

Hypotheses testing III

H0 & H1-- Examples: 
Is a coin fair 
Gender and grades 
Healing with a new medication 
Ability to cheat 
Marriage over time 

For each please write H0 & H1


Hypothesis testing IV 
Why do we test a hypothesis we don’t 
believe in? 

What does it mean to reject H0? 

If H0 is correct, the probability of getting this 
result (or a more extreme result) is very low 
-- thus we reject H0 and accept H1 

Hypothesis testing IV

Probailities


The meaning of p


What does p means? 
What is the difference between 
p = 0.03, p = 0.001, & p = 0.11 
What is the relationship between p and conﬁdence? 
What is the relationship between p and effect size? 
What is the relationship between p and number of 
subjects? 

2 types of errors 
Not conservative and liberal just balancing 2 
types of error 

H0 is 
wrong 

H0 is 
correct 

Correct 

Type I error  Reject H0 

Type 2 error  Correct  Accept H0 

The importance of

effect size 

Always give effect size measures 
Mean difference 
Quartile differences 
etc.
