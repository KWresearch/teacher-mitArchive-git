Critical thinking

• Religious survey

• Sexual behavior examples as teaching 
material

 Critical thinking
• Observing and recording data is the central 
aspect of social science

•
• Sometimes, the data at hand is not ideal…
•
• The question we will start addressing today is 
what can we learn from different types of 
data. 

Correlation & causation
• Every day we see in the news claims such as:
• People are happier in better weather
• Boys who mature later suffer from depression
• Runners outlive other athletes
• Kids who breast feed have a higher IQ
• There is a negative correlation between # of hours 
watching TV and grades in school
• These are reliable statistical relationships, but are 
they causal?
• For each write down the cause for the effect

Examples:
• Women who exercise regularly have less 
natural miscarriages. 
• Can you deduce that exercise help reduce risk of 
natural miscarriages?  Why
• Famous conductors in the US live about 7 
years longer than the average
• Students who come to all the classes do 
better
• Why? What is the story?

Correlation & causation
• Famous conductors in the US live 
about 7 years longer than the average.

Interpreting correlations
• Sometime we have a very strong causal 
model
• Good weather causes happiness…
• Sometime strong models can be wrong
• Running prevents heart attacks 
• Making people run can cause heart attacks...
• The “hot hand”

So???
• The only way to draw valid conclusions is to 
have a control group!
• In the Uri Geller case we should have tested how 
many clocks were observed to start working by 
someone else..

•
• In most cases, the only way to have a good 
control group is to conduct an experiment

Self-selection!
• Runners select themselves
• Famous conductors
• Berkeley….

5 year cholesterol experiment
• P(death|no treatment) = 21%
• P(death|treatment) = 21%
• What about regularity?
• P(death|regularity) = 15%
• P(death|non regularity) = 24.6%
• But now we have self selection again
• For regulars P(D|T)= P(D|no T) ~ 15%
• For non regulars P(D|T)= P(D|no T) ~ 26%

Experiments
• Are not a perfect method
• They are also susceptible to some problems
• Placebo
• The Hawthorne effect
• Self fulﬁlling prophecies
• Desire to cooperate

Placebo I
• In 1794 Gerbi discovered that by squeezing a 
certain worm between the thumb and the 
ﬁnger of the right hand, and placing the 
ﬁngers on a painful tooth, the pain went away 
for a year.
• Hundreds of patients were tested and 68% 
reported no pain for a year!

Placebo II
• In a study on the effects of birth control, three 
groups were used
• The pill with warning of side effects
• Placebo without warning of side effects
• Placebo with warning of side effects
• Group #2 reported 6% side effects
• Groups #1 & #3 reported 20% side effects

Placebo III
• Old French medical book suggest to use new 
medicines as fast, when its healing power is 
the strongest
• Probably when the physician believes in it the 
most 

Placebo IV
• Study on the ability of vitamin C to prevent the 
common cold
• 2 Groups randomly assigned
• But it turns out that by opening the capsules the subjects 
could see if they were in the control or placebo group (the 
hint was people who dropped out).
• When testing only SS who did not know which group 
they were in, the treatment was not effective.
• When testing only SS who did know which group 
they were in, the treatment was effective

Placebo V
• The Hawthorne effect
• In 1924 a study was done on effectiveness at 
work
• The recommendation was to improve lighting 
condition
• This helped for a while but not long term
• Other changes had the same effect …. 

Placebo -- summary
• Placebo strong effects 
• Threatens the conclusions from many experiments
Important to have a good control condition
•
•
• Placebo is real
• Opiods
• Sensitivity
• Attention

Self fulfilling prophecies
• Teachers who are told that some kids are 
very smart, ﬁnd that these kids get better 
grades 
•
• Researchers who believed that they have 
genetically inferior rats found them to have a 
lower performances
•
• Smart Hans …

Desire to cooperate
• In many cases subjects want to help the 
experimenter.
• If you tell subjects what is your hypothesis they 
will help you ﬁnd it..
• This is why we prefer blind experiment
• Even better are double blind experiments
• Computer controlled experiments are another 
approach.

Summary
• People are bad measurement devices
• We observe and infer “rules” where there are 
non!
• Correlations / causation
• Self-selection
• Placebo
• Self fulﬁlling prophecies
• Statistics and research methods are here to 
protect us against ourselves
