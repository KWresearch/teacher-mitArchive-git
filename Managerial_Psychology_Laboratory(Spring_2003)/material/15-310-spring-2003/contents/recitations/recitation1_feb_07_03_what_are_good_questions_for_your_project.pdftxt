What are good questions

for your project?


 What are good questions? 

•  Applied or theory ? 
–  Applied meaning you are trying to estimate 
particular parameters 
•  Examples:  Politeness, opening doors, etc. 
–  Theory meaning you are trying to understand 
a directional effect 
•  Examples: Politeness, opening doors, etc. 

 What are good questions? 

•  Applied or theory? 
–  Applied is more specific, theory is more general 
•  Engineering vs. Science 
–  “There is nothing more practical than a good 
theory” 
•  Kurt Levin 
» 

•  At what stage of product development is each more appropriate? 
•  When is represented sampling more important? 
•  When is exact implementation more important? 

What are good questions? 

•  Relevant is a good criteria 
–  But relevant to who? 
– 
•  “Big” is a good criteria 
• 
•  More general (theoretical) questions are 
likely to be “larger” & more relevant 

Ethnics in research 

•  There have been a lot of cases of abuse 
–  Medical cases where they gave people different 
diseases. 
–  Shaking basic beliefs 
–  Philip Zimbardo’s jail experiment 
–  Stanley Milgram’s Electrical shocking experiment 
•  The Human subject review board COUHES is the 
local branch that is in charge of ethical behavior 
toward subjects 

Exercise in generating ideas 

•  In small groups propose questions you are 
interested in finding the answers for. 
– 
•  Practice “armchair” psychology 
–  Think of your own weird behavior (and on 
that of the people around you). 
–  Observe, introspect 
•  Also name 3 “bad” (useless) thins to test 

A few interesting projects III 

•  Example: 
Surveys (SWB) 
–  How happy are you with 
your life? 
•  One year after winning a lottery 
•  One year after a bad injury 
•  Control group 
–  People expect large differences but the 
differences are small 

A few interesting projects IV 
•  Example: inferences 
–  How often do you masturbate? 
– 
– 
–  A day / A year 
•  After that, how happy are you with your love 
life? 
–  measurement problems

SWB 

•  SWB = Subjective Well Being 
•  This is a measure of psychological “happiness.” 
–  Has many important policy implications (how 
to invest in environment, education, etc) 
–  And also many measurement problems 
• 
•  Together we will do a cross-religion research 
on SWB 

Task #1

• Across different relegious 
organisations
