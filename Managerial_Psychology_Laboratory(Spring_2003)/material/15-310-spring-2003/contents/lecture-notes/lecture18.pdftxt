Management of Transitions


•	 The critical points of vulnerability in the life of 
a project are the points of transition. 
–  Transitions can involve many parameters, for example: 
•	 People 
•	 Management 
•	 Leadership & leadership style. 
•	 Primary organizational responsibility and reporting 
relationships. 
•	 Nature of the work. 
•	 Types of knowledge required. 
•	 Physical location. 
•	 To change all of these simultaneously is to 
court disaster.

Management of Transitions  IV


•	 Projects must be protected through 
transitions. 
–	 There must be areas of continuity to offset the areas of 
change. 
–	 Team size must grow in a gradual fashion. 
•	 This has implications for both organizational structure and 
physical architecture. 
•	 Both must be very flexible to allow this to happen along with a 
gradual transition in reporting relationship. 
–	 There should be an extra effort to retain a sense of

‘ownership’ among team members.

•	 Avoid ‘runway management’.
