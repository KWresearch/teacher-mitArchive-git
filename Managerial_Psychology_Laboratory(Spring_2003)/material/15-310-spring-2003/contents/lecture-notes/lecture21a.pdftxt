We Shape Our Buildings
"We Shape Our Buildings" 

 
"On the night of May 10, 1941, with one of the last bombs of the last 
serious raid, our House of Commons was destroyed by the violence of the 
enemy, and we have now to consider whether we should build it up 
again,and how, and when. We shape our buildings, and afterwards our 
buildings shape us. Having dwelt and served for more than forty years in 
the late Chamber, and having derived very great pleasure and advantage 
therefrom, I, naturally, should like to see it restored in all essentials to its 
old form, convenience and dignity." 
 
-WSC, 28 October 1943 to the House of Commons (meeting in the House 
of Lords). 
 
Notes: The old House of Commons was rebuilt in 1950 in its old form, 
remaining insufficient to seat all its members. Churchill was against "giving 
each member a desk to sit at and a lid to bang" because, he explained, the 
House would be mostly empty most of the time; whereas, at critical votes and 
moments, it would fill beyond capacity, with members spilling out into the 
aisles, in his view a suitable "sense of crowd and urgency."
