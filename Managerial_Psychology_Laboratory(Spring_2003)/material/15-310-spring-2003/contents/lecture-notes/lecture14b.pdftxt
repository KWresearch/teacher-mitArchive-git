What do we know about technology transfer?

It is a 'people process'.
•
• Transferring documentation is, at best, an auxiliary process.
• People must be in direct contact and understand each other to
transfer knowledge.
• The best 'package' for knowledge is the human mind.
• Moving people is the most effective way to move knowledge
• This can imply either organizational or geographical movement.
• Organizational boundaries impose a serious barrier to the
transfer of technology
• This is due to the development of different organizational
cultures.
