The Basic Tradeoff and Dilemma in Product
Development Organization

•

• Departmental Organization
• Departmental structure is more
closely mapped to the structure
of the supporting technologies
It thereby provides a better
connection to those
technologies and better
ongoing technical support to
the project effort.
• This is, however, accomplished
at the cost of much greater
difficulty in coordination of the
project tasks and less
responsiveness to market
change.

•

• Project Team Organization
• Project Team structure groups
people from different disciplines
together in a single team all
reporting to a common manager.
It thereby provides better
coordination of the project tasks
and increased sensitivity to
market dynamics.
• This is, however, accomplished
at the cost of a separation from
the disciplinary knowledge
underlying the project effort.
When this is carried to an
extreme, it will gradually erode
the technology base of the
organization.

Structuring the Organization

• Standard Industrial Practice
– Ignores the rate at which technologies are
developing (despite the fact that this can
often be measured).
– Usually ignores the interdependencies in
project work (seasoned project managers
are an exception).
– Focuses on project duration (and usually
makes the wrong decision on this
parameter).
