INSTRUCTIONS

Approach people by explaining that you are an MIT student doing a class project, and were wondering if they

had a minute to answer a few questions – people are generally more responsive if you make it clear you’re not

trying to sell them anything, or get them to sign a petition.

For each respondent, mark whether the survey was done before or after the service, and write down the time of

the survey.  Then ask each person the six questions on the other page, starting with “How do you feel right

now?” and ending with “How old are you?”  Some people may not want to give their age (people can be

sensitive!). Finally, mark down their gender before they leave. Remember to thank them for their time!

It is very important that you ask the exact same questions, in the exact same order, using the exact same

wording, to each respondent.

Remember to mark whether the respondent was surveyed BEFORE or AFTER the service!
