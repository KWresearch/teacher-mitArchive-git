Spring 2003 

15.301 - WRITING REQUIREMENT ASSIGNMENT 

Topic: 
Despite the fact that we live in an increasingly technology-based world, there has 
been a decrease in the proportion of students in the United States (and many other 
countries) majoring in science and engineering.  From what you have learned about 
attitudes and attitude change, discuss what the underlying reasons for this change 
in attitudes might be and design a national program to attract more young people 
into studying engineering and science. 

General Format: 
•	 8-10-page paper, double spaced, 1-inch margins, and 12-point standard font 
(times or times new roman) 
•  Use at least 2 sources outside of course material (library research). 
•  Include a bibliography/reference list. 

Submission instructions: 
•	 The assignment requires two submissions: a draft mid-semester and a final 
version near end of semester (specific dates are listed in the syllabus). 
•	 Your specific TA will instruct you regarding the place to hand in both 
submissions. 
•	 You should hand in two copies of each submission (i.e. two copies of the draft 
and two copies of the final version.  One copy will be used by the Writing TA 
and the other by your 15.301 TA.  You will therefore receive comments from 
both TAs and both will be involved in the grading process. 

Grading Composition: 
•	 This assignment comprises 10% of your overall grade in the course.  5% comes 
from your 15.301 TA grading the content of your paper, and 5% from the 
Writing TA grading your writing style.  For content, you will receive a grade on 
your 1st draft and another on your final version, and they will be averaged.  For 
writing style, you will receive comments on your 1st draft and a grade on your 
final version. 

Grading Criteria: 
•  The paper contains a descriptive and concise title. 
•  The paper contains a concise (150-200 words) Executive Summary/Abstract. 
•	 The introduction provides context for the problem being examined, justifies the 
author’s approach to the problem, and specifically describes the paper’s focus.
