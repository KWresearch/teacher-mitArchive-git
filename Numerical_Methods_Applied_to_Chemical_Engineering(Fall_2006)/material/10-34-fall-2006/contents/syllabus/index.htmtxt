Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session
A list of topics by lecture is available in the calendar listed below.
***** Purpose *****
    * To ensure you are aware of the wide range of easily accessible numerical
      methods that will be useful in your thesis research, at practice school,
      and in your career.
    * To make you confident to look up additional methods when you need them.
    * To help you become familiar with MATLABÂ® and other convenient numerical
      software, and with simple programming/debugging techniques.
    * To give you some understanding of how the algorithms work and to help you
      understand why numerical algorithms sometimes give unexpected results.
***** Topics *****
This course focuses on the use of modern computational and mathematical
techniques in chemical engineering. Starting from a discussion of linear
systems as the basic computational unit in scientific computing, methods for
solving sets of nonlinear algebraic equations, ordinary differential equations,
and differential-algebraic (DAE) systems are presented. Probability theory and
its use in physical modeling is covered, as is the statistical analysis of data
and parameter estimation. The finite difference and finite element techniques
are presented for converting the partial differential equations obtained from
transport phenomena to DAE systems. The use of these techniques will be
demonstrated throughout the course in the MATLABÂ® computing environment.
***** Prerequisite *****
Solid undergraduate preparation including but not limited to Calculus (18.01,
18.02), Differential Equations (18.03), Linear Algebra (18.06), Thermodynamics
(5.60, 10.213), Fluid Mechanics (10.301), Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design
(10.37).

**** Recommended Texts ****
Other easier-to-read but less comprehensive texts that are helpful:

Comes in various editions.

MATLABÂ®: Implementations and Applications. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-
Hall, 2000. ISBN: 9780201308600.

***** Homework Guidelines *****
You will submit your solution electronically. The due date is 9am on Wednesday,
although submissions after that time will be marked as late and (at least for
this first homework) accepted on the same day. If you have difficulty working
with the computer systems, please consult the TAs.
Write a MicrosoftÂ® WordÂ® document with the title username_HW1.doc, where
username is your MIT e-mail name (for example, for
sample_email_address_ihtfp@mit.edu, it would be
sample_email_address_ihtfp_HW1.doc). In this document, describe how you solved
each problem, and include as figures any graphs that you wish to present. Like
any piece of technical writing, you must find a balance between being concise
and providing sufficient detail that an educated reader can follow your
reasoning and methods. The MicrosoftÂ® equation editor is available for typing
any equations.
If in a particular problem you are asked to write a MATLABÂ® program, gather
all necessary code into a single .m file and submit it electronically as well
(we may wish to run it). Use the file name username_HW1_PX.m for the program
for problem X. In your MicrosoftÂ® WordÂ® document, clearly note the name of
any program that you submit, and describe how it may be used to perform the
calculation for the problem; for example, describe what you should provide as
input, how the results are stored, etc.
Do all analysis and data visualization within your MATLABÂ® program - do not
export your results to another program such as MicrosoftÂ® ExcelÂ® for
plotting. It is not necessary and makes it difficult for us to reproduce (and
assess) your results.
You are free to discuss and consult with your colleagues, but everyone must
submit his or her own programs and solution. You may not simply copy the
program of another, or jointly write the same program. This would defeat the
purpose of the class, which is to provide you with personal experience in
scientific computing.
