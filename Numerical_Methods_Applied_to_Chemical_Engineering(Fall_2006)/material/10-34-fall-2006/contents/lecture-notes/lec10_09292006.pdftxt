1) We chose a basis {φn(x)} and an inner product 
 
orthonormal: <φm|φn> = δmn 
 
2) We’re trying to solve Ôf(x) = q(x)

unknown 

given    

but that looks too scary to start with”)

Must evaluate integrals Hmn: difficult to evaluate, quantum mechanics requires 6-
dimensional integrals. H becomes a large matrix when n gets large. 
 
Also have Boundary Conditions:  f(x = 0) = f0

Adds another equation:

v·c = f0
How to solve? Can try to fit by least squares and just fit all the equations approximately. 
Can drop larger n terms to leave space for boundary conditions. Another way would be to 
not consider the boundary conditions and then craftily choose Φn so that they solve the 
boundary conditions. 
 
To check if answer makes sense:  write out the series and see if cn converges 

Evaluate Residuals 
R = Ôf – q  

 

max(R) < tol?                                                                  
||R(xi)|| < tol? 
we will evaluate this later
