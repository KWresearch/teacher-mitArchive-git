Lecture #35: Problem Solving Summary and Review. 
Problem Solving 
Well-Posed Problems 
• 

In reality, you define the problem 

 

Example: At Exxon, Professor Green was told that the “lubricant gums up in the engine.” 

Had to take ill-posed problem and transform to a well-posed problem. 
•  Could solve kinetics 
•  Could solve thermodynamics 

 

RECOGNIZE WHAT TYPE OF PROBLEM  (cid:198) Rewrite equations in standard form 
•  Algebraic equations 
o  Linear 
o  Non-linear 
•  Differential eq uations 
o  ODE 
(cid:131) 
Initial Value Problems 
(cid:131)  Boundary Value Problems 
o  PDE 
•  Optimization 
•  Stochastic Simulations 
Estimate SOLUTION 
•  REALITY CHECK! 
•  Set constraints for optimization (i.e. least-squares) 
•  Good initial guess 
•  At least think about UNITS! 

 

(OR) Error or warning message 

Write some MATLAB (cid:198) Run Computer (cid:198)  SOLUTION 
• 
Check if solution works!! 
• 

is reasonable to spend as much time checking solution as obtaining it 
o  e.g. have two different programs written by two different people 
•  How important is it that you are right?

•  Even if solution works, does not guarantee solution will happen 

 

Sensitivity Analyses – check for ill-conditioning 
•  Numbers from numerical solution will not match experiment because input 
parameters have uncertainty 
•  Usually at least 1% error in measurements

parameters
)

 sensitive to 1% error, ill-conditioning 

If 

• 

∂

M·x ≈ b  (cid:198) use SVD 
•  once you get a solution, do Taylor expansion, linear equations, check condition 
number cond(M)

Start with messy equations……… differential equations 
1)  Discretize (cid:198) F(x) = 0 
2)  Taylor series (cid:198) Linearize

Solve linear equations.  Then may discretize a different way to 

see whether we get the same answer.  

Newton’s method has best convergence close to minimum. 

Computer Programming (Key to MATLAB) 
•  Reusability (avoid writing too much code) 
•  HEADER to function/program: inputs/outputs/function description (what it does)
