Homework  
1)  For those who haven’t programmed before – expect it to take time 
2)  If you get stuck and are beyond the point of learning, stop and move on.  The 
homework is a learning activity.

if A = AT  ‘symmetric’  
if A = AH  ‘Hermitian’  
if A·AH = AH·A  ‘normal’ 
if AT = A-1  ‘orthogonal’ 
if AH = A-1  ‘unitary’   
If a real matrix is symmetric, it is also Hermitian.

Hermitian matrices come up in quantum mechanics.  All steady states in quantum 

mechanics are hermitian eigenvalue problems.  Unitary matrices also come up in quantum 

mechanics and are basis transformations.

. Always symmetric, because of the equality of mixed partials. 

Because they are symmetric, they are also ‘normal’. 
Similarity Transform   
A·wi = λiwi   B(S-1wi) = S-1A(S·S-1)w = S-1A·w = S-1λiwi = λi(S-1wi) 
B = S-1A S  
 ‘B is similar to A” 
A & B have the same eigenvalues 
This is used in practice to calculate eigenvalues. 

   identity matrix 

 

 
How to find S?   
if you’re GOOD – find perfect S  such that S·A·S = Λ 
very difficult to find this S unless someone tells you the  
 
eigenvector 

Find a diagonal matrix similar to A to find eigenvalues of A. 
-1… S1
-1A S1…S2
 (cid:198) (cid:198) Λ 
 
S2
continue to add S and S-1 
 
on each side and eventually  
you will get at the eingenvalues 
 
In quantum mechanics people use matrices of 109 x 109
“You have to be very crafty to find the S of such a matrix.” 
B = Q-1A·Q   (B is similar to A) 
  = (Q-1Q)R·Q = R·Q = B   (QR Algorithm is found in textbook 
and is very complex) 
 
 
 
 

A = Q·R  

 

 

 
 

orthogonal     upper 
(Q-1 = QT)      triangular 
 
A(c·wi) = λi(c·wi) 
eig(A) gives eigenvalues/vectors   (see help eig) 

does not matter how you scale, still get the same eigenvalue 

*Uses EISPACK, which is available from netlib 

Why is this useful? 
singular matrix (cid:198) λi = 0  
cond(A) = |λ|max/|λ|min    trace: tr(A) – sum of λi  (Σ(λi) = Σaii) 
 
Example Problem 
dy/dt = A·y 
 
 
if A is normal 
multiply both sides by WH   WH dy/dt = WHWΛWhy  
dy/dt = WΛWHy  
d/dt(q1) = λ1q1  
d/dt(WHy) = Λ(WHy)  q(t) = WHy(t)  
q1 = q1,0eλ1t 
dq/dt = Λq 
d/dt(q2) = λ2q2  
q0 = WHy0 
look at initial conditions 

Initial Conditions 

y(t=0) = y0

 

 

 

Schur Decomposition 
y(t) = W·q(t)

Sometimes things are asymmetrical so ‘eig’ function will give you a matrix.  However, you 
can always do Schur decomposition:  A = URUH
If you do Schur you get: d/dt(WHy) = λ(WHy) 
If A were not normal, use Schur:  A = URUH
