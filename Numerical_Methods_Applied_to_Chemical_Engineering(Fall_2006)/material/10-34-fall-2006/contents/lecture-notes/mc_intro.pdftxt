Basic Aspects of MC Applications

• Stochastic – i.e., some element of 
randomness.
• Contrast with standard integration 
algorithms.
• When is MC useful?

Problem from Friday Class
• Compute an integral of
p(q)f(q)dq where p(q) is a probability 
distribution.
• You could do it by sampling 
{q1,q2,q3,...} from the distribution p(q), and then 
just averaging
<f> ~ {f(q1)+f(q2)+...+f(q3)}/N
and that as N gets large this average will 
approach the value of the desired integral.

Comparisons of accuracy

• MC – accuracy ~ N-0.5
• Other methods – accuracy ~ N-1/d

Problem with Random States

• Ex: calculation for area of 
hyper-sphere for calculation of 
Pi.  Chance of ‘hit’->0.

• Importance Sampling –
concentrates sampling in 
regions of higher probability

Idea of Phase Space

• Represents the entire set of states that 
can be occupied by the ‘system’.
• Ex: all values for which p(x) is not 0.
• What if phase space represents a very 
small portion of the randomly generated 
possibilities?: ex. Bonded molecule.

Ergodicity

• MC often used to simulate time-dependent 
processes, although there is no ‘time’ in 
MC simulations.
• Ergodic Theorem:  Phase space average 
is identical to the time average.

Metropolis Method

• If the attempted move lowers the energy, it 
is automatically accepted.
• If the attempted move increases the 
energy, it is accepted with probability 
p(x)=exp(ΔE/kT)
• Only need RELATIVE probabilities

Metropolis Method (cont.)

• The attempted configuration represents a 
deviation from a previous configuration.
• Important:  If a move is rejected the ‘old’
state is counted again.
• Does this make sense?

MC vs. MD

• Equilibrium vs. Dynamics

Orientation of Polymers using MC

• MD cannot typically probe large (ms) time 
scales
• MC can find equilibrium sets of 
configurations – typically shorter 
correlations because of the possibility of 
unphysical moves.

using MC
