Lecture #28: Guest lecture on Monte Carlo / MD. 
 
Intro to MC Methods   
• 
stochastic – element of randomness 
• 
contrast with standard integration algorithms 
•  when is MC useful?

Comparison of Accuracy 
MC – accuracy ~ N-0.5 
 
Other methods – accuracy ~ N~1/d

on accuracy 

Random States 
• 
calculation of area of hyper-sphere for calculation of Pi 
o  chance of hit (cid:198) 0 
Importance sampling – concentrates sampling in regions of higher probability

Ergodicity 
•  MC often used to simulate time-dependent processes, although there is no “time” in 
MC simulations 
•  Ergodic Theorem: Phase space average is identical to the time average

Metropolis Method 
• 
if attempted move lowers the energy, it is automatically accepted 
• 

if attempted move increases the energy, it is accepted with: 
o  p(x) = exp(∆E/RT) 
•  Only need relative probabilities

equilibrium 

•  attempted configuration 
represents a deviation 
from previous 
configuration 
Important: If move is 
rejected, the “old” state 
is counted again

Orientation of Polymers using MC 

MD cannot probe large (ms) time scales 

MC can find equilibrium sets of configurations 
- 

typically shorter correlations because probability of impossible moves 

 

EXAMPLE – evolution of torsions 
• 

statistically sample phase space
