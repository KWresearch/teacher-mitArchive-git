Suppose one samples 106 points. To obtain an additional significant figure requires 108 
points, so it is difficult to acquire another significant figure. Often, only w(q) is known, not

The reason fluctuations do not have to be considered in many systems is N = 1020 or 
greater. Thus,  1020+ 1010 shows the fluctuations do not affect greatly the significant 
figures.  In nanoscale systems, biological systems, and ignition events, the volumes are 

 

small so then fluctuations are noticeable.

Stiff solvers (need Jacobian), number of variables less than 104. Cannot solve biological

Many problems use combined atoms (no hydrogens), remove bond stretches, keep bond 

torsions and bends. 

 

Be careful of error bars when using these methods.
