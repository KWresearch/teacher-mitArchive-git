You want eig(J) all < 0 
If this condition is true, you will find xsoln
If eig(J) is positive: unstable state, will go farther  
away from solution with time. 

 
It is always important to find the Jacobian.   
If the eigenvalue of the Jacobian is less than zero, you have found the stable steady state.

Stable system always has J < 0; however, there could be unsteady values outside the 

region analyzed. 

Physical Example: If you leave gas on in a room, the situation is metastable, but could blow 

up with a spark.  If the gas is burning, the situation is stable. 

 

There are 2 parts to stability: the equation system and the solver method. Both must be 
stable in order to find a useful solution. 
 
There are complex mathematical analysis techniques to determine stability that require 

more information about F(x), but in practice the Jacobian test is usually sufficient. 

Bifurcations 
In reaction problems, you can always get a steady state solution with a cold system and no 

conversion.  However, if you increase temperature, you can reach a steady state solution 

where everything reacts.  At intermediate temperatures, there is a parameter that governs 

x = 

the extent of reaction.

different directions, but once you go one 

direction, you can’t choose the other.

Figure 4. For small perturbations away from best fit you will get an ellipse.  As you get far 
outside best fit, you will not get ellipse. The shape is nonlinear and irregular.  
 

     

You can find equations for P1 and 
P2 from the eigenvalues.

On homework you did Finite Differences: 

Both methods give an approximate solution 
• 
• 
Best way to deal with Boundary Conditions: 

can make differences smaller and smaller with a finer mesh 

can make function space larger and larger with a bigger basis 

Set up basis so it is guaranteed to meet the boundary conditions. 

 

 

However, your solution may not fit ALL boundary condition because it is an approximation 

that neglected the higher order terms in the expansion (see pg. 1 of this lecture).
