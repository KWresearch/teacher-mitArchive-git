Homework  
•

•

• 
include any issues you had 
Factorization 
All NxN real matrices can be written: A (cid:198) PTLU  
(L: lower triangular, U: upper, P: permutation) 
 
MATLAB is an offshoot of LAPACK (linear algebra package) 
•  Can download LAPACK from netlib 

Linear algebra is a WELL-DEVELOPED 
area of study 

 
Ax = b  
in MATLAB:  x = A \ b 
‘\’ is an “amazing function” – very powerful 
 
 
 
        * WARNING: do not always know what it’s doing 
 
 
Uniqueness and Existence of Solution 
if rank(A) = N     NxN –- solution exists 
 
if rank(A) < N, det(A) = 0       --   singular, rank deficient 
at least one eigenvalue = 0 
 
*find additional equation* 
no inverse:  z ≠ A-1*0
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ax = b  
does rank(A) = rank([A b])? 
if yes, there is a solution  
if yes and rank(A)<N, there are an infinite number of solutions 
 
Symmetry
 AT = A 
Also called Hermitian Matrix if all coefficients are real 
General Hermitian matrix: transpose and complex-conjugate. 
positive definite: xTAx > 0 for all x ≠ 0   (all eigenvalues are positive) 
 
 
If symmetric and positive definite:  A = UTU; O(N2) operation (takes less memory) 
   L = UT    
Cholesky factorization:  U = chol(A) 
 
 
 
 
 if not symmetric/positive definite: ‘chol’ gives incomplete factorization 

Az = 0, where z ≠ 0

- but you don’t know xtrue

εmachine = usually 10-14

Even if matrix is N = 109, can still achieve an rtol of 10-5

Condition number of A (cid:198) cond(A) 

If the condition number is large, a small change in A or b leads to a large change in 

. xδ

If A is singular, there is no A-1 and cond(A) = ∞ 
 

 

 

Start next time:  how scaling affects the condition number
