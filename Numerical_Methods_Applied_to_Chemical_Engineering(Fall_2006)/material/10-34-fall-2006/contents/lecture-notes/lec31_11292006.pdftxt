Drag ~ Brownian motion (cid:198) Diffusion 

We say “flux” – But each particle is moving on its own. Only when we consider their 

movement over time can we consider there to be flux in a room. 

This applies in lots of other physical situations

not a good way to  

calculate viscosity 

because τ is small so 

shear rate is high,  

which results in 

shear thinning and 

an irrelevant 

viscosity calculation

Use fluctuation – dissipation on static system to calculate diffusivity and then use Stokes – 

Einstein to obtain viscosity. 

 

Use molecular dynamics for 10 ns or faster. Diffusion of orientation faster than diffusion of 

center of mass.
