Lecture #12: Ordinary Differential Equation Initial Value Problems (ODE-IVPs) and 
Numerical Integration. 
From Last Lecture: Singular Value Decomposition 
Sobserved(λn,tk) = Σxi(tk)Ai(λn) + noise

T(λn)                    Fixed in time. Amplitude changes with wavelength 
ΣσiUi(tk)Vi
    For a system where only one chemical absorbs light, expect one singular value to be 

bigger. The rest of the singular values relate to noise. Look in Beer’s textbook for exact 

notation.

Boundary Conditions: Initial Value Problems (IVPs) 
x(t0) = x0  
As you move away from x0, you are not sure whether you are correct. That is why the first 
step, if incorrect, can send you far away from the answer and errors can multiply. 
Boundary Conditions: Boundary Value Problems (BVPs) 
x(t0) = xi0 
xj(tf) = xjf

1) High order methods have much faster convergence as ∆t (cid:198) small 

numbers and small numbers: 

If too high order, we are fitting the noise to f(t), but if too small ∆t, we are adding big

2) Adaptive step sizing, adaptive meshing 

With adaptive step sizing, or adaptive meshing, the time step sizes are smaller close to the 
steep peak and larger along the tail where the function is not changing as quickly.

No way to guarantee global error 

With ODE’s, the error in each step accumulates in a nonlinear way. In integration, the errors 
are present for each step separately, additive. Computing the integral incorrectly for a 
previous step does not affect the step at hand.
