By looking at 2nd 
derivatives, find 
parabola that is 
lower than other 
minimum. 

 

Figure 2. Convex underestimator. 
 

Choose a f(x), upper bound. Divide domain. Underestimate the lower bound with a 

parabola. Find minimum of parabola. Bound again. If new upper bound is lower than lower 

bound in other region, can stop considering that section.

To converge – lower bound rises at a certain rate; upper bound decreases at a certain rate. 
Going several zones deep, creates many divisions: 2Ndivisions(1-D) 
Proteins: 100 dimensional space or more: 100N or more 
Current papers: can solve 4-5 dimensions 

Method guarantees global optimum (if you care about the global optimum) 

 

If you have 20 variables, use heuristics that often find the global optimum, but there is no 

guarantee.

In low dimension, draw map. One method, do different starts. Run a local minimization on 

each, then compare values. With enough points, can make a space. Can use mesh. Can use 
Monte Carlo – random guess. If there are 100 points and 6 variables, 1006 calculations.

Figure 4. The molecule is heated and then cooled slowly so that conformational changes taking 
  place will lead to a local minimum. This process is repeated many times until several closely 
  related, low energy, conformations are obtained.
