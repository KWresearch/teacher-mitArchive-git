10.34 – Fall 2006 
HW Set #2 
Solutions 

Problem #1: 

This was a straightforward linear regression problem that was well-outlined in the problem 
statement in the textbook.  The regression fits the data almost exactly.  All of the rate data should 
have been fit to only two parameters, as you would not expect the values of k2 and Km to change 
if the initial enzyme concentration were to change. 
k2  =  104.5041  g_S/min/g_E
  
g_S/L 
Km  =  8.5924

Problem #2: 

Part A: 
This was a simple program writing exercise with no results needed for part A.  A simple 
algorithm for this task would look like this if Ndata = Nparam: 

function a_vec = calc_poly_coeff(x,f) 
for i=1:length(x)

for j=1:length(x)

X_mat(j,i) = x(j)^(i-1);

end


end 

a_vec = X_mat\f; 

Part B: 
The purpose of this part was to write a program that utilizes the result in part A that fit a set of 
Cv data.  The best fit parameters for the 3rd order polynomial and the condition number of the 
polynomial system matrix are: 
The condition number is:  1.568e+010 
Polynomial coefficient values: 

a0 = 2.96  cal mole-1 K-1

 a1 = 0.016278  cal mole-1 K-2 

 a2 = -1.1278e-005  cal mole-1 K-3 

 a3 = 3.0247e-009  cal mole-1 K-4 


Part C: 
This part was about comparing the results of the polynomial form and the Pade form, and 
determining which had more accurate interpolation/extrapolation abilities.  Linearized form:

 a2 = 1.3466e-006  K-2

 a3 = 0.0014574  K-1


The first figure shows the interpolation ability of the two.  Both will produce essentially the same 
quality of interpolation (although this will not always be the case… especially since polynomials

can often “snake” through the points instead of having a nice, monotonic increase as in the above 
case.). 

However, when one looks to extrapolate the data to high temperatures, the results are wildly 
different.  The polynomial case diverges quickly after the last data point and predicts an 
unphysical Cv value above ~1700 K.  The Pade form proves to be well-behaved over range 
plotted, mainly due to the formulation of the equation such that the correct asymptote is reached 
at high temperatures (it can be readily seen that Cv(TÆinf) = Cv,inf. 

Part D: 
This part is dealing with the same problem, but using a scale variable in the polynomial 
(τ = T/1000K).  The polynomial coefficients in this case are: 
The condition number is:  2.774e+002 
Polynomial coefficient values:
a0 = 2.96  cal mole-1 K-1
 a1 = 16.2778  cal mole-1 K-2
 a2 = -11.2778  cal mole-1 K-3
 a3 = 3.0247  cal mole-1 K-4 

These coefficient values are exactly what you would expect, since they should all be scale 
(multiplied) by 103n, where “n” is the order of the T/1000 term.   

You will notice a sharp decrease in the condition number, when compared to the previous case… 
a decrease of 8 orders-of-magnitude.  This implies that the problem was perfectly well-structured 
and has a unique solution, but the scaling is poor.  This problem would be exacerbated even 
more if the polynomial was of higher order.   

Part E: 
In this case, neither of the forms fit very well (the polynomial is no longer monotonic), but the 
Pade is so bad that it has a singularity in the interpolation.  The bad (and potentially dangerous) 
thing with a case like this is that the function still fits the data exactly but until you more fully 
examine the behavior of the equation, you cannot really know how good it is at estimating data. 
(units are the same as above)
Polynomial coefficient values:
a0 = 3.1614 
a1 = 0.015047 
a2 = -9.0398e-006 
a3 = 1.7814e-009 

Pade coefficient values: 
a0 = -2.3819 
a1 = 0.06721 
a2 = -4.2846e-006 
a3 = 0.004127

Analysis of the System: 
The total number of flow rates in the system is 20, the above 18 unknowns and Ac1 and Al1. We 
can draw 3 independent control volumes on the system to do the mass balance. The three control 
volumes are 
1.	 Balance over the junction of stream1, stream 2 and stream4. This balance gives us 4 
equations, one for each species flow rate. 
2.	 The balance around reactor and this equation gives us 3 equations. We don’t get 4 
equations from this mass balance because there is a reaction happening in the reactor.

3.  The balance around separator. This balance gives us 4 equations. 

Thus there are in all 11 equations inherent in the system. To define the system completely we 
need another 9 constraints. In part 1 of the problem we are given 7 measurements and 2 other 
constraints (acid mass fraction is 10% of the recycle and separator puts 90% of the ester coming 
from stream 3 into stream 6. Thus we must be able to solve the system of equations.

Ac4/176 + Ac1/176 - Ac3/176 = E3/190 – E4/190 (moles of ester formed equals the  
moles of acid lost) 

Rearranging the terms, 
E3/190 – E4/190 + Ac3/176 - Ac4/176= Ac1/176 

E3/190 – E4/190 = W3/18 + W5/18 - W1/18 - W4/18 (moles of ester  
formed equals the moles of water formed) 

Rearranging the therms, 
E3/190 – E4/190 – W3/18 – W5/18  + W4/18+ W1/18 = 0

Ac3  - Ac4 - Ac6 = 0 (Acid Mass Balance)

Since no reactions take place in separator we can do species balance across it. 

Species Mass Balance: 
W2 + Al2 + Ac2 + E2 – W4 – Al4 – Ac4 – E4 – W1 = Al1 + Ac1 
Al2 – Al4 = Al1 
Ac2 – Ac4 = Ac1 
W2 – W4 – W1 = 0 

Equation 15 

Total Molar Flow rate of 6: 
W6/18 + E6/190 + Ac6/176 = F6 

Equation 16 

Ac4 = 0.1(Ac4 + Al4 + E4 + W4) 

Rearranging the terms: 
0.9 Ac4 – 0.1 Al4 – 0.1 E4 – 0.1 W4 = 0 

Equation 17 

Ac4 – r4 * Al4 = 0 

Equation 18 

Ac3 – r3 * Al3 = 0 

The above set of equations give us 18 unknowns for 18 equations. If this problem is well posed 
then it should be solvable.

The output1 is a vector of size 18 and contains the flow rates of all the components in all the 
streams.  

Part 2: 

In this problem again we have 11 inherent equations due to system configuration and 20 
unkowns. Here we are given 8 measured quantities and another constraint, namely acid flow rate 
is 10% on the total mass flow rate in the recycle stream. Thus at first look it seems that the 
system should be solvable. But let us analyze it more closely by taking the control volume shown 
below.

 Ester is coming out only in stream 6 with a known flowrate E6. This ester is being formed in the 
reactor. Also the Acid is going into the system with a known flow rate Ac1 and is coming out 
with a known flow rate Ac6. The difference between the inflow rate and the outflow rate of acid 
is the amount of acid that is getting reacted in the reactor. Thus due to the stoichiometry of the 
reaction taking place in the system we realize. 

E6/190 = (Ac1 – Ac6)/176 

Thus some of the specified quantities are related by an inherent constraint of the system, which 
implies that there are really only 5 independent quantities that are specified. Further analysis will 
show that specifying the input and output flow rate of alcohol is also redundant. Thus on 
formulation of the problem the overall system will be rank deficient by 2. Thus the system of 
equation will not have a unique solution if at all it has a solution.

Problem #4: 

Modeling equations: 
There are two equations that one needs to solve the problem: an energy balance and an extent of 
reaction equation.  You could also formulate the problem using the atom conservation or explicit 
equations for each specie and the extent of reaction, but this would lead to more equations, which 
can make non-linear problems more difficult to solve… less variables is better.  The fact that the 
reaction is equimolar and the heat capacities of the products and reactants are equal simplifies 
the problems. 

As given in the problem, the rate expression is: 
⎡ P P   − P P  exp ( ∆G   RT  ) ⎤
− E A  ⎞
⎛

⎥
⎜

⎝  RT  ⎠ ⎣ 
atm 
 
⎦ 

The energy balance is as follows.  The term n/t is the number of moles in the reactor divided by 
the residence time, which also equals the flow rate into the system.  This could get much more 
complicated if heat capacities vary 
Heat Generated by Rxn = Energy to Heat Inlet to Reactor Temp + Heat Loss

The other equation keeps track of the reaction extent, and says the number of moles of CO 
consumed in the reactor (z) is equal to product of the rate and residence time: 
(  , 
)
 T  
z
t=  res  ⋅
rate
 z
Rxtr 

We want to reduce the rate equation to be only a function of T and the progress variable, z, so we 
have 2 equations.  A balance could be written out in terms of each species/atom, but this case is 
simple enough to simplify without that.  The equations we need are:

Now the two balances now have rate(z,TRxtr) and can be solved for these variables.
