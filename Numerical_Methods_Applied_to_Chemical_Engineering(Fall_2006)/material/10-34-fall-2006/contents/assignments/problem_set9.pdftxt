Homework: Models vs. Data 
Due Monday November 13, 2005, 9 am. 

Your task is to analyze the dataset Signal(λ,t) presented in the SVD homework. Each 
point in this dataset is an average of 100 repeated experiments, so you expect the 
uncertainties in these data to be approximately given by a Gaussian distribution. 
Unfortunately, the individual points from each repeat were not stored, only the average 
value, so you do not know the standard deviation corresponding to each point, and you do 
not know the expected variance in the averaged data.  

Before beginning, you are 100% certain that the data is of the form 

Signal(λ,t) = Σ ci(t) Ai(λ) + noise 

  Also because of their physical meanings, concentrations c and absorption strengths A 
can never be negative. You are 99.9% sure the volume change during the reaction is 
negligible, i.e. dci/dt = (1/V) dni/dt is accurate to as many digits as you can measure, and 
you are 99.9% sure that the noise level in the instrument is the same at every wavelength 
and time point to the accuracy with which you can determine it. 

Based on the SVD analysis (see solution to homework 5), you believe that there are only 
two absorbing species contributing to the signal, call them B (which decays away, related 
to species 2 in homework 5 posted solution) and C (which is formed, related to species 1 
in homework 5 posted solution).  

The SVD analysis appears to show two different time constants. This suggests two 
different very simple kinetic models, either sequential reaction (where C is formed from 
B) or independent reaction (where C is not formed from B): 

Sequential reaction model:  B Æ X  rate constant k1
 
  
rate constant k2 
 XÆ C 
initially no X or C in the mixture, just B. 
According to this model, B drops off as a single exponential, time constant 1/k1. C 
rises as a double exponential, with time constants 1/k1 and 1/k2. 

   
rate constant k1
Independent reaction model:  BÆX 
rate constant k3 
 YÆC 
Initially no X or C in the mixture, just B and Y. 
According to this model, B drops off as a single exponential time constant 1/k1, 
and C rises as a single exponential, time constant 1/k3. 

The SVD analysis also suggests that the absorption spectra of B and C can be modeled as 
a sum of one or two Gaussian Peaks, i.e. 
AB(λ) = Σ ApeakB,n exp((λ-λB,n)/wB,n)2) 
AC(λ) = Σ ApeakC,n exp((λ-λC,n)/wC,n)2)

Your assignment is to: 
1) Write out the analytical expression for Smodel(λ,t,θ) for each of the competing 
models. Observe that some of the physically-meaningful parameters in the models are not 
separable, e.g. cB(to) always appears multiplied by an Absorbance, so you might be able 
to determine the product of cB(to) and an Absorbance, but you will not be able to 
determine cB(to) separately. (You could get an equally good fit by cutting cB(to) in half 
and doubling all the AB’s.)  Rewrite each Smodel(λ,t,θ) in terms of a smaller set of 
parameters that you think you can determine from the data. 
2) Based on what you know from the beginning and from the SVD analysis, come 
up with an initial estimate of the noise level σ, and a prior distribution p(θ) expressing 
what you think you know about the likely values of the parameters and their uncertainty 
ranges. 
3) Determine a set of best-fit parameters for each of the two kinetic models. 
Compare the deviations between the data and the best-fit model with your expected noise 
level. Are the deviations centered about zero? Does their distribution look normal (i.e. 
Gaussian)? 
Note: The parameters you would like to determine are the An’s, λB,n’s, and wn’s in 
the Gaussian model for the absorbance, the initial conditions in the kinetic models, and 
the rate constants. Since you will definitely not be able to determine all these parameters 
independently, you will probably have to fix some parameters or impose some constraint, 
or in some other way reduce the number of parameters θ being adjusted. Explain clearly 
how you do this, and whether or not you think it reduces the ability of the fit to match the 
data. 

Hint: Do some simple fits first, holding some parameters fixed at values estimated 
from the SVD analysis. Then use these refined values as initial guesses when you allow 
other parameters to float. You will probably need quite a good initial guess to solve the 
nonlinear least-squares problem if you allow more than 10 parameters to float 
simultaneously! 
3) Determine if either of the kinetic models is plausibly consistent with the 
experimental data, based on a quantitative χ2 test. 
4) For the independent-reaction model, make a contour plot of χ2 vs. (k1,k3) 
holding all the other parameters at their best-fit values. From this plot estimate the 
uncertainties in k1 and k3, and explain how you made the estimate. Compare this to the 
numbers you obtain from the covariance matrix (including all the parameters). These are 
both conventional approaches to estimate uncertainties, and to see correlations in 
uncertainties between two parameters.  
5) Make a contour plot of pModel(Ydata|k1,k3)*pPrior(k1,k3) vs. (k1,k3) holding all the 
other parameters at their best-fit values. From this Bayesian estimate of the shape of the 
new probability distribution p(k1,k3) make an estimate of the uncertainties in k1 and k3. 
Explain. 

Write a summary paragraph giving your conclusions about which model(s) can be made 
to fit the data, the corresponding best-fit values of the parameters, and your best estimate 
of the uncertainties in the parameters you obtained.
