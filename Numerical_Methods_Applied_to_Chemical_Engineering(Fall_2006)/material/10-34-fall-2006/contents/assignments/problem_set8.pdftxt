Solve  6.B.1  in  Beers’  (pg.  432)  by  GMRES,  using  sparse  representation  of  the  large 
matrix. Note  that  you may  have  to  restart GMRES  after  a  few  iterations,  and  also  things 
may work better if you pre-condition the matrix. Your Matlab program should take T0,T1, 
lambda,  rho, CP, Re, mu,  and R  as  inputs.  Please  run your program  for  the  case  (you do 
not need to answer specific questions ask in Beers’ book, only the ones asked here): 
 
T0 = 300 K 
CP = 4 J/g-K 
 
Generate following plots (over a range that shows all dynamics):   
-  A 3-D surface plot and 2-D contour/pcolor plot of the velocity field 
-  A plot showing the T(z) for r = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 cm (all on the same figure) 

λ = 0.6 W/m-K 
 
 
μ = 0.5 cP = 0.5 x 10-3 N-s/m2 

ρ = 1 g/cm3  
R = 5 cm 

 
 

T1 = 400 K 
Re = 100  

 
Hints  and  notes:    The  flow  in  the  problem  and  the  ambiguous  boundary  conditions  in  the  z-
direction  create  a  problem:  how  can  we  define  the  axial  boundary  conditions?    This  is  a  place 
where  the  scaling  analysis  you  have  learned  in  transport  can  be  important.    We  know  that  at  -
infinity  the  temperature  is T0,  and  it  is T1  at +infinity, but what  are  reasonable  approximations  to 
these infinite boundaries.  One can define a characteristic time for thermal diffusion/conduction in 
an analogous way to species diffusion:

This  would  be  an  estimate  of  the  time  to  conduct  heat  over  the  radius  of  the  tube.   We  also  can 
estimate  the maximum velocity of  the  flow based on  a given Re.   We want  to make  sure  that we 
have enough length (z-direction) to our mesh so that the heat conduction will have enough time to 
saturate  the  flow  at  the  center,  and  the  entire  cross-section of  the  tube will have  a  temperature of 
T1  at  the  end  of  this  length.   As  an  initial  starting  point, we  recommend  that  the  length  be  set  to 
allow for 10 characteristic conduction times based upon the centerline velocity in the tube.  If you 
find  the  to  be  insufficient  to warrant  a  constant-T  boundary  condition,  then  the  length may  need 
to be increased further. 
 
Also  note  that  starting  at  z  =  0  and  saying  T(z=0,r)  =  T0  is  not  valid,  since  there  will  be  some 
back-diffusion  against  the  flow  (especially  near  the wall).   A  good  starting  point may  be  to  start 
the grid a length equivalent to 1 or 2 characteristic times upstream (i.e. T(z= -2vcenterline*tcond) = T0)

Solve  6.B.2  except  do  not  neglect  external  mass  transfer  resistance.  Instead,  have  your

transfer  situation  as  an  input.  The  bulk  substrate  concentration  is  1 M  in  the  main  flow, 
but  lower  at  the  surface  of  the  bead.  The  diffusivity  of  S  in  the  liquid  is  7.0x10-6  cm2/s.  
You  can  assume  that  the partitioning  coefficient between  the  liquid and gel phases  is 1.0 
(i.e. Sliq = Sgel @ interface).  Please generate a solution for the cases R = 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 
mm (again, you do not need to answer the questions in the original problem).   
 

-  Plot  the  concentration profiles within  the bead  for each case  in a  single  figure  for 
a Sherwood Number of 10.   
-  Once  you  find  the  concentration  profile  within  the  bead,  determine  the  total 
consumption rate of S (moles/s) in each case.   
-  Assuming  that  the  enzyme  is  very  expensive, which  bead  size would  you  choose 
to run the reactor? 

 
Problem 3:   
Solve 6.C.5 using  the method of  lines  to  cope with  the  stiffness  in  the y direction. There 
is a misprint in the problem statement; the correct conditions to assume are:  
 

-  CA = CAB = 0 and CB = 1 mole/liter at the top of the slope 
-  assume  mass-transfer  in  the  gas  phase  is  fast,  so  pA=1x10-4  atm  at  the  gas-liquid 
interface.  
-  Assume the vapor pressures of the solvent, B and AB are negligible (in reality the 
vapor pressure of the solvent would probably not be negligible).  

 
We suggest you start with a very coarse discretization in the z direction.
