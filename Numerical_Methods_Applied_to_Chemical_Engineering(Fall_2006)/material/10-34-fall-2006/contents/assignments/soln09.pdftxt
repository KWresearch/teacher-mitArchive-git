Problem1 

1.  Let  us ﬁrst  derive  an  analytical  espression  for Smodel (λ, t, θ) using both 
the models  mentioned  in  the  problem  statement. 
•  Model 1:  Sequential Reaction Model 
According this model C is formed from B through an intermediate 
species  X,  we  can  write  the  rate  of  formation  of  B,  X  and  C  as 
shown  in Equation(1).  In writing the  rate rules  in Equation(1) we 
have  made  use  of  the  fact  that  the  volume  is  constant.

=  k1 [B ] − k2 [X ]

=  k2 [X ]

We  can  solve  the  equations  simultaneously  to  get  the  expressions 
for  the  concentrations  of  [B ],  [X ] and  [C ]  shown  in  Equation(2).

If  we  look  at  the  absoption  spectra  of  B  and  C  in  Figure  1  as 
given  by  SVD we  realise  that B  has  two  distinct  peaks  and C  has

two diﬀerent  gaussians and C can be written  as a sum  of only one 
gaussian  as  shown  in  Equation(3).

are  k1 ,  k2 , KB ,1 , KB ,2 , KC,1 ,  λB ,1 ,  λB ,2 ,  λC,1 ,  wB ,1 ,  wB ,2  and wC,1 .

•  Model  2:  Independent  Reaction  Model 
In  this  reaction model  the  rate of  change  of B  and C are  indepen­

dent  of each  other.  The ﬁnal expressions  for the  concentrations  of

B  and  C  at  any  given  time  t  is  given  in  Equation(6).

where  xi  and  ai  are  respectively  the  concentration  and  absoptions  of 
the  species.  We  are  told  that  the  noise  at  each  wavelength  and  each 
time  comes  from  the  same  normal  distribution.  Thus  we  can  calculate 
the  standard  deviation  of  the  noise  using  the  values  obtained  from  the 
noise  matix. 
Since we  dont  know  anything  about  the  reactions  taking place  and  the 
abosorption  spectrum  of  the  species  we  will  just  assume  that  all  the 
parameters  are  uniformly  distributed  in  some  arbitrarily  large  range 
of  values  chosen.  For  example  the  values  of  the  rate  constant  will  be 
positive  and  have  values  less  than  1015  which  is  the  range  of  the  rate 
constant  for a unimolecular  reaction.  Also since we assume  that all  the 
parameters  are  independent  of  each  other

•	 Model 1:  Sequential Reaction Model 
At  t=0  we  are  told  that  the  concentration  of  C  is  0.  Thus  all 
the  absoption  signal  that  we  observe  is  due  to  species  B.  Using 
Equation(5)  we  realise  that  the  absoption  at  t=0  can  be  used  to 
determine  the  value  of KB ,1 , KB ,2 ,  λB ,1 ,  λB ,2 , wB ,1  and wB ,2 . The 
matlab code to do the above ﬁtting is provided in ﬁle fitAbsForB.m 
and  the  parameters  that  it  calculates  are  KB ,1  = 0.3000,  KB ,2  = 
0.0501,  λB ,1  =  450.6204,  λB ,1  =  469.2274,wB ,1  = 3.1041  and 
wB ,2  = 9.7590.  The  comparison  of  the  Best  Fit  Absorption  and 
the  Signal  Strength  at  t=0  are  provided  in  Figure  2. 
Also  if  compare  the  absoption  spectrum  of  B  and  C  using  Figure 
1,  we  realise  that  the  absorption  signal  at  wavelength  470  nm 
is  solely  due  to  B.  Thus  we  can  calculate  the  rate  constant  k1 
using  the  absoption  signal  at  470  nm  and  using  the  parameters 
KB ,1 ,  KB ,2 ,  λB ,1 ,  λB ,2 ,  wB ,1  and  wB ,2  which  we  have  calculated 
previously.  The  matlab  code  bestfitk1.m  is  used  to  get  a  best 
ﬁt value of k1 .  The best ﬁt  value of k1  = 0.0497 and  the graphical 
comparison  of  the model  vs  data  is  shown  in  Figure  3. 
From Figure 3 it is apparent that the concentration of B is close to 
zero at time t=100 s.  Thus the at t=100, all the absoption is due to 
species C. We dont know the concentration  of C and  so we will be 
able to calculate the absoption proﬁle of C to within a constant fac­
tor.  This ﬁtting is performed using the matlab ﬁle fitAbsForC.m.

The  parameter  values  are  KC,1  = 0.7339,  λC,1  =  439.844  and 
wC,1  = 6.94.  The comaprison of ﬁtted value of absoption of C and

Finally  we  see  that  C  has  a  absorption  maximum  at  439.844  nm 
and  B  does  not  absorb  at  that  concentration.  Thus  we  can  use 
the signal  strength at 439.844 nm to calculate the best ﬁt value of 
k2 .  This  is  done  in matalb  ﬁle  bestfitk2  model1.m.  The  best  ﬁt 
value  of  k2  = 0.0889  and  the  graphical  comparison  of  normalized 
concentration  of B with  the  signal  at  440 nm  is  given  in Figure 5. 
We can now use all the values, estimated so far, as the initial guess 
for a routine which tries to ﬁt the entire matrix of signal.  The mat-
lab function that accomplishes this task is p3  model1  error  bestfit.m. 
The  deviation  between model prediction  and  the data  and  the  er­
ror  is  plotted  in Figure  6.  The  best  ﬁt  values  of  the  parameters  is 
given  in Table  1.

•  Model  2:  Independent  Reaction  Model 
For  this  model  the  initial  guesses  for  all  the  parameters  besides 
k3  is  calculated  in  exactly  the  same  way  as  the  previous  Model. 
For  calculating  the  value  of  k3 ,  we  take  the  wavelength  440  nm 
and  ﬁt  the  concentration  of  C  to  the  analytical  formula  given 
in  Equation(6).  This  ﬁt  is  performed  using  the  matlab  function 
given in command  bestfitk2  model2.m.  The  comparison  of  the 
ﬁt with  the Signal strength at 440 nm  is given  in Figure 7 and  the 
value  of  k3  = 0.0303.  Again  we  use  the  values,  calculated  so  far, 
as  the  initial  guesses  and  perform  a  full  ﬂedged  optimization  to 
calculate  the  values  of  all  the  parameters  using  the  matlab  func­
tion  p3  model2  error  bestfit.m.  The  values  of  the  parameters 
calculated  are  given  in  Table  2.  The  distribution  of  the  error  is 
shown  in  Figure  8.

4.  To	 apply  the  χ2  test  we  assume  that  the  underlying  distribution  of 
errors  is  a  normal  distribution.  Then  we  calculate  the  χ2  value  of  the 
distribution  using  the  Equation(9) �  δ 2 
i 
χ2  = 
σi 
In the above equation δi  are the  individual errors and σ  is the standard 
deviation  of  the  error  around  0  that  we  have  calculated  in  part  2  of 
the  problem.  The  value  χ2  will  be  distributed  according  to  the  χ2 ­
distribution  if  the  number  of  sample  points  in  large.  In  our  case  the 
number  of  sample  points  are  large  (5151 points).  The  number  of ﬁtted 
parameters are 11 and thus the degree of freedom of the χ2 -distribution 
is  5140  (=5151-11). 
•	 Model 1:  Sequential Reaction Model 
The χ2  value of model 1 = 1.3 × 106 .  The p-value  is 0.  Thus there 
is  100%  probability  that  the model  is  incorrect. 
•	 Model 1:  Sequential Reaction Model 
The  χ2  value  of  model  1  =  5.480 × 103 .  The  p-value  is  0.0005. 
Thus  there  is  99.95%  probability  that  the model  is  incorrect.

The  values  of  χ2  of  model  1  ad model  2  are  calculated  using  the  func­
tions  p3  model1  error  bestfit.m  and  p3  model2  error  bestfit.m 
respectively. 

5.  For  Model  2  we  have  made  an  array  of  k1  and  k3  and  calculated  χ2 
values  for all the combinations of k1  and k3 .  The graph is plotted using 
the  matlab  function  p5  contourplots.m  and  the  graph  is  shown  in 
Figure  9.

Figure  9:  χ2  with  diﬀerent  values  of  kf  and  kr 

To  convert  the  χ2  plot  to  a  plot  of  probability  we  just  calculate  the 
value  of  Δχ2  =  χ2(k1 , k3) − χ2 
and  this  value  of  Δχ2  is  distributed 
min 
with a χ2  distribution of 2 degrees of freedom.  The contour plot of 95% 
and  90%  conﬁdence  interval  of  k1  and  k2  are  plotted  in  Figure  10. 
From  Figure  10  we  can  read  oﬀ  the  95%  conﬁdence  interval  for k1  and 
k2  as  0.04998  ≤  k1  ≤  0.050065  and  0.024995  ≤  k3  ≤  0.025008.  Both 
the  ﬁgures  are  generated  using  the matlab  code  p5  countourplots.m. 
We  can  also  use  the  built-in  matlab  functions  nlinfit  and  nlparci 
to  calculate  the  conﬁdence  intervals  on  k1  and  k2  and  the  conﬁdence 
intervals  given  by  these  functions  are  0.049968  ≤  k1  ≤  0.050074  and 
0.024993 ≤ k3  ≤ 0.025014.  The matlab  function which  generates  these 
conﬁdence  inervals  is  p5  model2  param  est.m.  The  conﬁdence  inter­
vals  provided  by  the matlab  function  are  very  close  to  the  values  given

Figure  10:  90%  and  95%  conﬁdence  contours 

by  plotting  the  graph.  Due  to  the  large  number  of  data  points  (5151 
data points) and relatively fewer ﬁtted parameters, the conﬁdence inter­
vals of all the parameters are small.  The matlab functions approximate 
the  bottom of  the well  of  the χ2  distribution  as a  parabola.  If  the  con­
ﬁdence  intervals  are  small  then  the  parabola  approximation  is  usually 
very  good. 

6.  In  part  2  of  the  problem  we  assumed  that  the  distribution  of	 θ  was 
uniform.  Speciﬁcally  for  k1  and  k2  we  assumed  the  probability  distri­
bution  was  uniform  between  0  and  1014 .  If  one  were  to  normalize  the 
probability  distribution  the  constant multiplying  factor of pprior (k1 , k2) 
will  get  eliminated.  Thus  for  a  uniform  prior  probability  distribution 
the answer  to this part will  look exactly  like Figure 10.  The conﬁdence 
intervals  calculated  will  also  remain  unchanged.  The  values  of  k1  and 
k2  will  be  eﬀected  only  if  we  have  speciﬁc  prior  information  about  the 
probability  distribution  of  k1  and  k2 .
