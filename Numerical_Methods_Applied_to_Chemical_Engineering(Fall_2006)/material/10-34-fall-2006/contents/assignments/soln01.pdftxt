Problem 1: 

1) Copy the code in a matlab file called plot_bessel_usinig_ode.m and run it on the 
command prompt. The sample command line input and the graph obtained are as follows. 

>> plot_bessel_using_ode(10)

2) I have made a matlab file plot_bessel_using_besselj which contains the function 
of the same name. We can run the command on matlab window. 
>> plot_bessel_using_besselj(10);
>> 
The output plot obtained is as follows.

The plot appears to show that fzero does not perform as robustly as fsolve and 
fminsearch, which both yield the correct root over the entire range of guesses.  In this 
case we are not concerned with the numerical noise in the solution near the root, as this 
can be reduced by changing the tolerances of the solver.  Adjusting the tolerances may 
also help fzero find the correct root more robustly.
