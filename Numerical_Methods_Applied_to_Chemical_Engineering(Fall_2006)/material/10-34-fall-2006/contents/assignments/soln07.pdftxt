There  are  a  few  ways  to  solve  this  problem,  one  could  formulate  it  as  a 
ODE  or  as  a  DAE  (We  are  going  to  formulate  the  problem  as  a ODE).  The

In this formulation we evaluate the value of vp  using equation (1) in terms

and  dh .  Ofcourse  none  of  this  needs  to  be  done  analytically.  Everything  is

functions  of  h  and  dh ,  we  can  get  one  single  equation  which  can  be  written

as  g (h, dh ) = 0.  This  equation  can  be  solved  to  obtain  a  value  of  dh  for  any

the  ode  from  integrating  on  after  the  height  has  reached  0,  we  use  events

10.34 – Fall 2006 
Homework #7 - Solutions 

Problem 2 – CSTR Optimization (Beers’ text 5.B.4) 

In  this  problem,  we  wished  to  find  the  optimal  operating  condition  for  a  CSTR  in  order  to 
produce  the maximum  amount  of  [C].   We were  given  a  reaction mechanism  and  the  necessary 
rate constants, and we asked to vary the initial concentrations of A and B, the reactor temperature 
between 298 K and 335 K, and the reactor volume from 10 L to 10000 L.   

The  solution  procedure  involves  using  a  constrained  optimization  program  (fmincon  in Matlab) 
to  solve  the problem.   The other potential difficulty  in  the problem  is  that  the we do not have an 
explicit  cost  function,  but must  solve  for  the  steady-state  concentrations  in  the CSTR.   This  can 
be  done  using  fsolve  to  solve  the  nonlinear  equations,  or  using  an  ODE  solver  to  integrate  to  a 
long time so that the reactor is at a steady state.  The general reactor equations are:

in

where

) 
] 

 

] 

In  the above expression, vX,n  is  the stoichiometric coefficient of species X  in  reaction n, Rn  is  the 
rate  of  reaction  n.  At  steady-state,  the  time  derivative  will  be  equal  to  zero,  yielding  a  set  of 
nonlinear equations. 

One  notable  problem  encountered  in  this  problem  was  that  fmincon  would  not  vary  the  reactor 
volume  variable  when  trying  to  perform  the  optimization.    This  problem  could  be  remedied  in 
several  ways.  Perhaps  the  best  way  was  to  scale  this  variable,  one  possibility  was  to  make  the 
optimization  variable  LN(V_rxtr).    What  this  does  is  to  effectively  make  the  variable  smaller, 
and a unit change  in  the scaled variable will make a much  larger change  in  the cost function  that 
a unit change in the unscaled variable.  Another way to improve the optimizer performance when 
using  unscaled  variables  was  to  increase  the  tolerances  (TolFun,  TolX,  and  TolCon).    Making 
these  small  helped  to  gain  a  true  solution  for  a wide  range  of  initial  guesses.   Matlab  codes  that 
solve  the  problem  using  scaling  and  an  ODE  solver,  and  well  as  solving  the  unscaled  problem 
using an ODE solver and fsolve are included. 

The optimal reactor operating conditions are: 
Inlet [A] = 1.3515 M
Inlet [B] = 0.64845 M
Reactor Temperature = 298 K
Reactor Volume = 478.896 L 
Outlet [C] = 0.24913 M

This plot simply serves to show that 
the fitted value of A and EA for the rate 
constant are correct and fit the data 

In the cases where an ODE solver is 
used to estimate the SS condition of the 
reactor, it is useful to run the time-
dependence to convince yourself that 
you integrating to a large enough time 
to ensure that a SS is achieved.  This is 
not a guarantee that all parameters sets 
encountered during the optimization 
yield a SS at this length of time. 

Since the reactor volume was giving us 
problems, it is useful to see how the cost 
function varies with V_rxtr at the 
“optimal” solution returned by fmincon.  
In this case, you can see that the fmincon 
solution appears to be correct.  If the 
volume was not adjusted to its optimum 
value by fmincon, the open circle would 
not be at the minimum of the cost 
function.

Problem 3 – Chemical Equilibria 

This  problem  with  chemical  equilibria  in  a  system  where  the  reactions  are  not  known,  and  the 
assumption  is  that  there  are  enough  reactions  that  connect  the  species  that  there  are  no 
stoichiometric  constraints  imposed  by  reactions.    This  could  also  be  considered  the  “absolute” 
equilibrium  condition  of  the  system  for  a  given  initial  condition  (meaning  that  this  will  be  the 
absolute lowest Gibbs free energy obtainable for the given conditions).   

The  cost  function  was  set  up  in  the  problem  for  you,  and  essentially  was  minimizing  the  total 
Gibbs free energy of the system.

What  you  end  up  with  is  an  optimization  problem  based  on  the  number  of  moles  each  species. 
The constraints on the system are two-fold.  The first is obvious and is that all species must have 
a number of moles that is greater than zero (in this problem, the lower bound actually needs to be 
set  to  a  number  greater  than  zero,  if  not,  the  natural  log  term  will  cause  problems).    The  other 
constraint  is  based  on  the  atom  balances,  saying  that  the  total moles  of  H,  C,  and  O  initially  in 
the  system  must  be  equal  to  the  number  of  moles  of  H,  C,  and  O  at  equilibrium.    This  type  of 
constraint can be written as follows: 

A n
⋅
jk
eq 

=  A n
 
⋅ 
jk 
0 

where the elements of Ajk are number of j atoms in species k.   We can then use fmincon to solve 
this optimization problem. 

Part A: 

Consider  a  constant  T  and  P  equilibrium  reactor,  with  T  =  1000  K  and  P  =  1  atm.    The  initial  

charge  of  reactants  is:  2  moles  CH4,  3  moles  H2O,  0.5  moles  CO,  and  1  mole  of  H2.   Give  the  

number of moles of each species at equilibrium, as well as the corresponding mole fraction.   

Total moles initially:  6.5 

Initial Volume (L):  533.39 

Total moles at equilibrium:  10.0216 

Final Volume (L):  822.3757

Part B: 

The species HO2 is a radical species and would typically be found in very small quantities.  What  

would  be  the  approximate  number  of  moles  at  equilibrium  for  HO2  estimated  using  the  

concentrations  of  the major  species?   Does  the  value  found  using  the minimization make  sense,  

explain? 


The idea of this part was to show that you cannot always trust the numerical estimates when you 
have many orders of magnitudes between variables.  If you played with the tolerances in 
fmincon, you may have found that the number of moles of HO2 found using fmincon typically be 
at the lower bound set for the solver, even if it is set at 1e-14.   

However, there is a manual technique that can be used to estimate the concentration of a minor 
species in equilibrium with other major species.  The inherent assumption is that the major 
species’ concentrations are constant and unaffected by changes in the minor species 
concentration.  First, you have to think of an arbitrary reaction that relates the major species the 
minor species.  This reaction can be anything you want and does not have to be physical in any 
way.  Two such reactions for this system could be: 

4H O U 3H  + 2HO 
2 
2
2 

or 

2HOOH U H  + 2HO 
2
2 

Then you can write an equilibrium expression for this reaction in terms of the Gibbs free 
energies of the species: 

⎛ −∆G 
⎞ 
K A  = exp ⎜

RT 
⎝ 
⎠

and 

⎞νi

⎛φˆ y P
K A  = ∏ ⎜ i

⎝ P 
⎠


 

If you assume that the system behave ideally, then phi = 1 and the following holds: 

∏ i

⎯⎯ ⎯ K  =

We will take the 2nd reaction listed above:  2HOOH Ù H2 + 2HO2.  The delta G of reaction for 
this can be calculated to be 284120 J/mole.

2  ⇒ 

The approximate number of moles should be 7.61x10-10 .  This shows that the value calculated by 
fmincon is incorrect, and even inconsistent with the given data.  For numerical reason, this very 
small number cannot be calculated accurately, and changes depending on the tolerances given.
