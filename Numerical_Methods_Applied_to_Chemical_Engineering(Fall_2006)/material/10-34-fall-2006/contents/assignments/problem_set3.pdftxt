Problem 1: Peak Temperature 

For safety reasons, it is useful to be able to bound the peak temperature which could be 
realized in an exothermic reaction. An overestimate can be computed by assuming the 
limiting reactant is 100% converted to products, and the process is adiabatic (no heat 
losses). A more accurate bound can be computed by considering the fact that the reaction 
will reach equilibrium before the limiting reactants is 100% consumed.  

In an adiabatic process, enthalpy is conserved, so for an ideal mixture 

∑ i
(
m H T  
i

  ∑ k
) =  m H   (

)

 

 

For many common molecules, expressions for H(T) are presented in the NIST Webbook 
http://webbook.nist.gov. Usually these are given as coefficients for a Shomate functional 
form. A program Shomate.m is provided on the 10.34 Web page which can read these 
coefficients and compute H(T) (and other thermodynamic properties) for these 
molecules.  Note that Shomate.m only takes in coefficients A – G, Tmin, and Tmax; you 
will need to read the file to determine the format for the inputs. 

In this problem, we will investigate the peak temperature which could be reached in an 
adiabatic reactor for the Water-Gas Shift reaction.  In this case, the flow rates (in 
millimoles/second) into the reactor are:  
[H2] = 2, [H2O] = 5, [CO] = 1, and [CO2] = 0.1. 

Part A: 
Generate a plot showing the temperature dependence of the ∆Hrxn, T*∆Srxn, and ∆Grxn 
over the range of 500 – 1500 K. 

Part B: 
For the worst case scenario (100% conversion), generate a plot showing the peak 
temperatures as a function of the inlet temperature to the system over the range.

Part C: 
You know that the system cannot proceed beyond equilibrium under steady state 
conditions; therefore, solve for the realistic outlet temperature and CO conversion for the 
given range of inlet temperatures, and plot the results.   

Part D: 
You found the equilibrium boundary in the previous part, but this does not represent the 
entire range of accessible operating conditions.  Generate a surface or mesh plot of the 
reactor temperature using Matlab that displays ONLY the valid parameter space which is 
accessible experimentally.  (i.e. do not plot any points that are non-feasible based on 
equilibrium considerations).  The figure should have x- and y-axes as the conversion and 
inlet temperature, and the z-axis should be the reactor temperature.  You may find it 
useful that if a “NaN” appears in a vector or matrix being plotted, those points are 
ignored. 

Inlet temperature should span 500 K – 1500 K and conversion should span 0 – 100 %.  
Use 25 K increments for inlet temperature and 5% increments for CO conversion. 

As a 2-D example of what we are looking for in this problem, assume you we asked to 
plot the y(x) = sin(x), but do not show the points where y > 0.5 for x = 0 – 10.  The result 
would be this:

Problem 2: Finite Differences (Many variable problem) 

Consider the plug flow of water in a thin channel with optically clear walls. A laser beam 
is expanded and used to heat the water as shown in the figure below.  The light is uniform 
on the left wall, and may or may not exit the channel depending on the absorbance. 

Light

y 

If the region that is being heated by the laser is long enough we can assume that the 
temperature is independent of x and it is only a function of y. If heat provided by the laser 
is uniform across all y in the channel, then equation for variation of temperature with y 
becomes.

2d T
2  + H  = 0
dy 

Here H is the heat delivered to the water by the laser. If the walls of the channel are 
perfectly conducting, then the temperature of the water at the channel wall is equal to the 
ambient temperature. Thus the boundary conditions for this problem can be written as 

T 

= T  and  T

y w

y =0 

where Ta  is the ambient temperature 

This problem is a second-order differential equation in temperature and has two boundary 
conditions, and can be solved to calculate the temperature profile along the y axis. 

To do this, we discretize the problem using the formula: 

2d T  
dy 2 

yi 

= 

Ti −1  − 2Ti  + Ti +1
( ∆y ) 2 

If we divide the y axis into n intervals then we have n+1 points on the y axis, namely, 
y1, y2, y3,…….., yn+1  having temperatures T1, T2, T3,…….., Tn+1  respectively, we will get 
n-1 equations with n+1 variables.

In addition to the equations we obtain by discretization, we also have the two boundary 
equations, which can be written as 

T1 = Ta  and  Tn+1 = Ta 
 

Putting all the equations together we get the system of equations described below.

These equations constitute n+1 equations with n+1 temperature variables, and in this 
case, the system of equations are linear and so we can just use a linear solver to solve the 
system of equations.  

a)	 Formulate the problem to form a system of 101 equations (n=100) and solve the 
101 values of temperature. It is given that the width of the channel is 1 cm, the 
intensity of light is 0.3 MW/m2, the ambient temperature is 300 K. Assume 10% 
of photons are absorbed uniformly over the width of the channel.  Plot the 
resulting temperature profile and state the maximum temperature and the y-value 
at which it occurs. 

b)	

In reality, the intensity of light absorbed is proportional to the intensity of light, 
the concentration of the solution, and the absorption cross-section of the 
absorbing molecule. This causes the intensity of the light to decrease as it passes 
through the channel, also varying the heating rate across the channel.  The 
appropriate differential equation for intensity is: 
dI	 = ε(
dy 

)T I

In the above equation c is the concentration of the absorbing species. In our 
problem the concentration is constant and is absorbed in the temperature-
 .ε T 
dependent absorption cross-section,  (
)

The intensity absorbed is converted into heat in the system, and the rate of change 
of temperature along the y direction is given as:

Problem 3: Options for Broyden’s method 

In Broyden’s method, the procedure is similar to Newton’s method, but an approximate 
Jacobian, B(xn+1), is used instead of the true Jacobian, J(xn+1). It is obtained by the update 
formula 

B (

)

(
= B x 
n

) + χF (

 ) ( x  −
x 
⋅ 
n +1 
n +1 

T 
x  ) 
n 

Eq.(1)

Note F and x are vectors and B is a matrix.  F(xn+1)*(xn+1 – xn)T is a matrix (this is the 
outer product). χ is a scalar: 

χ= 

1 
x n +1  − x n

Eq.(2)  


Once one has B(xn+1), one then has to solve: 

) = F 
 ) ⋅ ( x 
(
− ( x n +1 ) 
n + 2  − x n +1 
B x n +1 

Eq.(3)

In some implementations of Broyden’s method, it is desired to update B-1 instead of 
updating B, this avoids the need to solve Eq.(3) – instead you would just use 

( x n + 2  − x  + ) = − B −1  x n  1  ⋅ F  x n +1

n  1

Eq.(4)

 One possibility is to use the Sherman-Morrison formula: 
= A−1  −γ( A−1 uv T  A−1 ) 
( A + uv T  )−1 

Eq.(5) 

where u*vT is a matrix (the outer product of the two vectors) and γ is a scalar: 

1 
γ = 
T
−1 
1 + v A u


 

 

 

Eq.(6)


Someone else suggests that if you had already LU factorized B(xn), then you could 
update this factorized form instead of LU factorizing B(xn+1), this way: 

Given:  L(xn) U(xn) = B(xn) 

Solve:  L(xn) U(xn) w = -F(xn+1) 
for w 
Eq.(7) 
  
(of course you would solve this in two steps:  solve L p =-F for p, 
then solve U w = p to get w) 
 

 

 

set: 

L(xn+1) = λL(xn) 

Eq.(8)

where λ is a scalar. 


Solve L(xn+1)*b = -F(xn+1) for b 

Eq.(9) 


Solve U*(xn+2 - xn+1) = b  for newest ∆x 

Eq.(10) 


Your friend says only L needs to be updated by multiplication by a scalar, and U can 
remain the same throughout. 

(a)  Show that Equation (5) is correct. 

(b)  If you already had computed the inverse B-1(xn), how would you update it to get 
B-1(xn+1) given by Eq. (1)? 

(c)  Give the algebraic expression for the value of λ would make the procedure 
recommended in Eqs. (7) - (10) work, so that the ∆x obtained in Eq.(10) would 
solve Eq.(3)? 
[Hint:   write (xn+2 - xn+1) = -B-1(xn+1)*F(xn+1) and expand out the inverse using 
Eq. 5, then multiply both sides by B(xn)] 

N.B. There are very frequently numerous methods for computing the same thing, but 
often some approaches are a lot better than others. Which of these three methods for 
computing ∆x take O(N2) operations, and which take O(N3) operations?
