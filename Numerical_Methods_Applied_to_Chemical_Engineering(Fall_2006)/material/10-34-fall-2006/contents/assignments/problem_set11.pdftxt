Kinetic Monte Carlo 

The  oxidation  of  an  organic  droplet  of  diameter  D  in  air-saturated  water  containing  an 
antioxidant can be modeled with these reactions: 

( ) 
1
( ) 
2 
( ) 
3 

ROOH  + 2RH  +  O2  → 2	
ROO + ROH  + H O

2 
2
ROO + RH  + O2  → ROOH  + ROO 

2ROO → ROH  + O2  + aldehyde 

If  the  radical  site  on  the  ROO  reaches  at  the  surface  of  the  droplet,  it  can  react  with  the 
aqueous antioxidant: 

( ) 
4 

( 
aq ) 
( 
aq )
ROO  + X  → ROOH  + X i

Note  that  the  second  reaction  is  the  radical-catalyzed  oxidation  of  the  organic,  and  the 
other  reactions  create  or  destroy  the  catalyst  ROO.  The  back  reactions  are  negligible 
under the reaction conditions of interest. 

These  equations  are  good  models  for  the  unhealthful  oxidation  of  lipoprotein  leading  to 
arteriosclerosis, for reactions important in emulsion polymerization, and for the oxidative 
degradation of several commercial products. For initial conditions, take [ROOH]=10-6 M. 
[RH]=10 M essentially constant, and due  to rapid mixing, [O2]  is constant at 10-4 M. T  is 
fixed at 40 C. Stop  the simulations  if  [ROOH]  reaches 10-2 M: by  that  time  the patient  is 
in  big  trouble,  or  the  product will  be  unacceptable. We  call  the  time  it  takes  [ROOH]  to 
climb  to  10-2  M  the  time-to-failure,  and  we  call  the  reciprocal  of  the  time-to-failure  the 
“rate-of-failure”. 

The average rate expressions (accurate for continuum kinetics) are (units are moles/L-s): 

⎛ −15000 
⎞ [ ROOH ]

Where k (nm/sec) depends on the concentration and activity of the aqueous antioxidant.

1)  Solve  the  kinetic  equation  using  the  continuum  approximation,  for  D  values  of 
30 nm, 50 nm, 100 nm, 250 nm, 500 nm, 1.0 µm, and 2.5 µm, and for k = 1.0, 10, 
and 100. Plot the computed rate-of-failure as a function of D and k. 

2) 	 Now  repeat  the  solutions  for  the  D  =  100,  500,  1000,  and  2500  nm  and  k  =  10 
cases  keeping  track  of  the  number  of  ROO  and  ROOH  molecules,  e.g.  by  using 
Gillespie’s  algorithm.  Make  histograms  of  the  probability  of  observing  a  certain 
“rate-of-failure”.  How  big  does  the  droplet  diameter  D  have  to  be  before  the 
average value of the rate-of-failure computed using Gillespie’s algorithm matches 
the  value  computed  by  the  continuum  approximation  to  within  10%? When  they 
disagree,  which  computation  is  more  accurate?  Comment  on  the  width  of  the 
distribution,  and  how  many  trajectories  need  to  be  run  to  achieve  good  statistics 
on both the average and the width of the distribution. 

3) 	 For D = 250 nm, do  simulations using Gillespie’s algorithm  for various values of 
k. Comment on the observed dependence on k. Physically, what is going on?
