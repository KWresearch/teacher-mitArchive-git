HW Set #11 Solution 
Kinetic Monte Carlo 

Notes: 
The  code  p1_main  will  not  generate  all  of  the  output  for  the  problem,  but  enough  for  parts  1  and  2. 
The  remaining  part  can  be  done  with  p1_main_part3.  However,  once  these  are  run  (or  if  you 
download  the  *.mat  files  posted),  you  can  simply  use  the  p1_postprocessing  file  to  generate  all 
the plots  and output.  If you  change  the name of  the  saved *.mat  files, you will need  to  also  change  the 
“load” commands. 

Algorithm (Gillespie): 
The  way  to  perform  kinetic  MC  is  relatively  simple  in  theory.    The  idea  is  that  you  calculate  a 
characteristic  time  for a  reaction  to occur based on  the  rates of all possible  reaction.   This characteristic 
time is defined as: 

−1 
⎛  ∑  rate i  ⎟
⎞ 
τ = ⎜
⎝ reactions  i 
⎠


units  of  time  ( per  reaction  event )


It is of the utmost importance to have the correct units on tau, otherwise the results will be meaningless. 
Tau  turns  out  to  be  an  extensive  property  and will  ultimately  depend  on  the  system  size,  as well  as  the 
other  parameters  that  determine  the  rate  of  a  reaction  (T,  Ci’s,  parameters).    You  can  rationalize  this 
because  if you have a  larger volume  (more molecules),  the  time between  reaction events should be  less. 
This  is  why  you  never  want  volume  terms  in  you  rates  when  computing  tau.    The  units  on  the  rates 
should be in terms of reactions events per time for the entire system. 

Once tau is calculated, you estimate the time until the next reaction event by using a random number: 

trxn  = tcurrent  −τ ⋅ ln ( rand [0,1 ]) 

Now,  you  must  determine  which  reaction  will  occur  when  trxn  is  reached.  At  this  time,  you  have 
determined  that  some  reaction will  occur,  and  the  probability  of which  reaction  it  is will  be  determined 
by the relative rates.  A reaction with a fast rate will have a higher probability of occurring than one with 
a  low  rate.  This  is  typically  done  by  using  another  random  number  between  0  and  1,  and  giving  each 
reaction  a  chunk  of  the  interval  [0,1]  based  on  the  value  of  rate i  ⋅τ .  Taking  all  reactions will  span  the 
entire interval, and reactions with larger rate will happen more often.   

After this is done, it is simply a matter of keeping track of all of the appropriate variables and optimizing 
your code to run in an efficient manner, which is not necessarily a trivial task.

Major Issues: 
There  are  some  issues  that  should  have  been  dealt  with  the  two  major  ones  being  how  to  round  the 
fractional molecules per droplet and the correct way to compute the rates.  A  fractional molecule should 
have rounded  in a probabilistically-correct way depending on  the fraction.   If  there were 0.25 molecules 
per droplet, you should have 0 ROOH’s 75% of the time and 1 ROOH 25% of the time.  A more correct 
way  to  deal  with  this  (and  droplets  that  had  >  1  molecules)  would  be  to  use  a  probability  distribution 
(e.g. Poisson distribution)  for  the number of molecules per droplet.   Since  this was not given, simple up 
and down rounding was acceptable.  See the code for how this was done (it is easy).   

The  correct way/unit  to  compute  the  rate was  important.   The  rates  needed  to  be  used with  the  units  of 
reaction_events/(sec*droplet).    This  was  accomplished  by  computing  the  rate  in  terms  of  #  per  second 
per  volume,  and  then  multiplying  by  the  droplet  volume.    This  will  result  in  units  of  seconds  for  tau, 
which is what you want.  Doing this will ensure you get the correct characteristic time.  One other minor 
point was  in  dealing with  the  recombination  rate, which was  dependence  on  [ROO]^2.   At  the  discrete 
2.  This  accounts  for  the  fact  that  if  one 
level,  you  should  actually  use  NROO*(NROO-1)  instead  of  NROO
molecule  is  present,  the  reaction  cannot  happen.    The  average  time  between  recombination  events  is 
1/k*N*(N-1)*Vdrop; each time a recombination event occurs N is reduced by 2. 

A bit of interesting (though not required) information: 
This was  not  required,  but  this  shows  the  time  progression  of  one  trajectory  for D  =  250  nm.   You  can 
see  the  piecewise  increase  of  ROOH  (which  happens  in  bursts  with  lags  in  between).    The  lags  occur 
when 2 ROO recombine and another initiation event must happen to get things going again.  In this case, 
you never have more than 5 ROO molecules present at any one time, and many times there are zero.

Part 1: 

The  following  plots  show  the  continuous  solution  to  the  problem.   The  three  small  plots  show  the  time 
dependence of  the concentration of ROOH, while  the  large figure shows  the rate of failure as a function 
of diameter and k-value.   It  is easy  to see  that the small droplets have much more dependence on k over 
the  ranges  studied.  This  is  due  to  their  small  size,  making  characteristic  diffusion  time  to  the  droplet 
edge implied by k larger.  For example, the rate of reaction 4 will change as follows for a small and large 
droplet for k from 1Æ 100: 
For D = 50: 
1/50 = 0.02  Î  100/50 = 2.0 
For D = 5000:  1/5000 = 0.0002  Î  100/5000 = 0.02 
Since  the  rates 1  and 2  are not dependent on  the droplet  size,  it  is  likely  that  the  small diameter droplet 
will be affected more, since the absolute rate will be larger.

Part 2: MC solution for D = 100, 500, 1000, and 2500 nm 

In  this  part,  the  solutions  for  all  diameters  are  shown,  even  though  only  several  diameters  were  asked 
for.  The histogram of the time to failure and rate of failure are both shown, with the mean value and +/- 
one standard deviation shown.  The mean and standard deviation only take into account the droplets that 
reached the critical concentration, and this will be discussed next.   

When  dealing  with  a  problem  like  this,  there  is  usually  some  degree  of  ambiguity  in  what  are  the 
appropriate  quantities  to  measure/report.    We  suggested  that  the  average  rate  of  failure  and  the  peak 
widths  may  give  a  reasonable  description  of  the  system  behavior.    However,  even  this  is  somewhat 
ambiguous, given  that  there  are  a number of ways  to describe  the average of  something.   There are  two 
logical averages that one would think about: 
1⎛
1
1 
1.	 Normal arithmetic average:    r N  = ∑ ri  =  ∑ ⎜
N i =1.. N 
N i =1.. N 
ti
⎝

⎞
⎟

⎠ 

2.	 Log-based average: 

( ) N 
ln  r 

= 

1  ∑ 
(
ln  ri

N i =1.. N


) 

Since  the reaction  times are distributed on a  log scale,  it seems  logical  that  the  log-based average would 
be  more  important  from  a  statistical  perspective.    However,  the  arithmetic  average  is  a  reasonable 
description  of  the  entire  system,  and  does  not  run  into  problems  when  the  rate  of  failure  is  zero.    One 
other  (likely  industrially  significant)  way  of  looking  at  the  problem  would  be  to  examine  the  point  in 
time  when  the  overall  concentration  of  ROOH  in  the  system  was  above  some  threshold  value.   In  this 
case,  the  total  system volume  is defined by:   Ndrop*Vdrop.  The  time  to  reach  the  threshold  concentration 
could be determined by solving this implicit equation for Tthreshold: 

[ ROOH ]threshold  = 

1 
N V  
⋅  droplet 

N  ⎪⎧Tthreshold 
⎪⎫

⋅ ∑ ⎨  ∫  N ROOH  i ,  ( )t  dt ⎬

⎭⎪ 
i =1  ⎪⎩ 
0	

This  would  require  keeping  track  of  number  of  ROOH’s  as  a  function  of  time,  which  would  be 
computationally  intensive.    If  one  stored  1x106  reaction  events  per  droplet  for  1x103  trajectories,  one 
would  require  on  the  order  of  10  GB  of  memory.    This  limits  the  scale  of  the  simulation,  and  nothing 
like this was expected in this homework assignment. 

There  are  two  general  cases  that  we  need  to  be  concerned  about.    The  first  is  when  some  droplets  will 
have  zero  ROOH’s  to  begin  with  (or  start  with  some  ROOH  and  reach  a  condition  where  there  is  no 
ROOH  or  ROO  at  some  time  >  0),  and  the  second  is  when  all  droplets  start  with  some  ROOH  and  all 
reach the critical concentraiton.  The latter is more straightforward and will be discussed first.   

All droplets have ROOH and reach the critical concentration 
It  should  have  been  clear  that  the  way  to  compute  statistics  (particularly  distribution  widths)  of  these 
cases was to use the log-scale averages and standard deviations.  This can be easily seen if a histogram is 
generated  in  log-space  and not  linear  space.   The  linear histograms will be greatly  skewed, whereas  the 
log histograms will be nearly normally distributed (as you will see in the ones below).  This implies that

Chemical Engineering, Fall 2006. MIT OpenCourseWare (http://ocw.mit.edu),

the mean and standard deviation should be computed  in  log-space, and  then converted  to a  real  time.    If 
the  linear  average  was  taken,  the  higher  time  and  rate  values  would  be  unfairly  weighted,  and  the 
standard deviation of the unscaled points would be meaningless since the distribution is heavily skewed. 
The procedure to calculate the “correct” mean, standard deviation, and confidence interval are: 

( )  =

⎤
 

These  averages  are  for  the N  droplets  that  reached  the  final  critical  concentration.   As  assumed  here, N 
and the number of droplets probed are the same, but won’t be below. 

Some droplet start without ROOH and/or reach a condition where ROOH + ROO = 0 
It  should  be  clear  in  this  case,  the  log-scale  approach  doesn’t  work,  since  the  rate  will  be  zero  for 
droplets that have no ROOH (completely stable) or reach the condition where ROOH and ROO are zero 
(the  ROOH  breaks  into  2  ROO,  and  then  2  ROO  recombine  before  they  can  produce  more  ROOH). 
There  is  not  a  good  universal  way  to  deal  with  this  case,  where  you  will  have  a  distribution  like 
described  above  for  the  reacting  droplets,  and  then  a  delta  function  at  zero  rate  for  the  stable  droplets. 
The  best  way  to  convey  the  information  would  likely  be  to  analyze  the  non-zero  rates  as  done  above, 
and  then  state  the  fraction  of  droplets  of  that  were/became  stable.    In  this  manner,  you  will  know  how 
many  droplets  would  become  contaminated  in  a  certain  amount  of  time,  and  can  find  some  ensemble 
average  rate  of  failure  if  desired  (where  as  an  average  alone would  not  give  you  as much  information). 
There  seem  to  be  two  reasonable ways  to  compute  the  ensemble  average  rate  of  failure.    The  first,  and 
most straightforward, would be to take a simple arithmetic average of the rates for all droplets (including 
the stable droplets).  The other, and more appropriate, way to compute the average would be to combine 
the log-average and the stable droplets: 

r 

0 
α
= ⋅ 
ensemble  α+ N 

+ N

⋅


r 
N
α+ N


In  this  formulation  r 
,  as  shown  above  is  the  log-calculated  average,  α  is  the  number  of  stable 
N 
droplets,  and  N  is  the  number  of  droplets  that  reached  the  critical  concentration.   The  benefit  of  this 
approach  is  that  the  ensemble  average  approaches  the  “correct”  average  as αÆ  0.  In  these  cases,  the 
standard  deviation/confidence  interval  is  not  particularly  meaningful  if  the  stable  droplets  are  being 
considered.  They are still calculated for the reacting droplets in the solution below, since it does provide 
some information on the width of the distribution.

The “mean” values and other  statistics are only  for  the droplets  that  reacted, denoted by  the  first  line of 
output  (737  droplets  in  this  case).    An  upper  limit  of  1x108  seconds  was  also  put  on  the  simulation, 
which is denoted by “Went too long”.  The next two lines should be self explanatory.  

This  first  point  is  that  the  continuum  rate  of  failure  is  much  too  large  when  compare  to  the  either  the 
mean  value  or  the  ensemble  average.   The  ensemble  average  is much  lower  due  to  the massive  number 
of  droplets  that  died  (only  737  out  of  2x108  droplets  reached  the  critical  concentration).    Due  to  the 
relatively  small  number  of  points,  the  CI  in  the mean  of  737  points  is  somewhat  large,  on  the  order  of 
10%.  The standard deviation is very significant as well.  A histogram for the time and rate of failure are 
shown below (and for all diameters).   The blue solid  line  is  the  log-scale mean,  the dotted blue  lines are 
the  +/-  one  standard  deviation,  and  the  dashed  yellow  line  is  the  arithmetic  mean  of  the  points  (which 
happens to overlap with the std. dev. line in this case).  You can see that the arithmetic average deviates 
significantly  from  the  log  average  (half  an  order  of  magnitude).    The  lines  will  be  the  same  for  all 
diameters.

The analysis of this is basically the same as 30 nm, since the number of droplets starting with an ROOH 
in  it  is small.   The statistics are much better  for  this case, since we have 7x105 droplets  that  reached  the 
critical concentration. 

In  this  figure,  the  axes  are  slightly  narrowed  to  show  the  histogram  better.    In  this  case,  there  are  still 
values  of  the  rate  near  1x10-3  s-1,  there  are  just  very  few  of  them.  Again,  you  can  see  that  the  linear 
average deviates from the true mean.

For  this  case,  you  can  see  that  the  ensemble  average  is  beginning  to  coincide with  the  averages  for  the 
reacting droplets because there are many droplets that started with some ROOH.  This case has the most 
“normal”  distribution  (more  correctly  log-normal).   This  is  likely  due  to  the  physics  that  arise  from  the 
problem.    There  seems  to  be  two  “hard”  walls  at  times  of  ~1x107  (upper)  and  3x103  (lower)  seconds. 
This  droplet  size  is  such  that  both  tails  of  the  distribution  are  relatively  far  from  these  limits  and  can 
assume  a  nearly  log-normal  distribution.    In  this  case,  the mean  and  standard  deviation  do  a  very  good 
job at describing the distribution of times and rate, where as the linear average would do a poor job. 

The  lower hard wall occurs when  the  initiation  reaction happen very quickly, and  this  lower  limit  is  the 
time  it  takes  for  the  propagation  reaction  to  generate  enough  ROOH  molecules.    This  lower  limit 
appears  to be approximately  the continuum  time  to  failure.   The upper  limit  is not a strict  limit, but  it  is 
very  rare  for  an  initiation  reaction  to  take  longer  that  ~1x107  seconds.    Once  the  initiation  happens,  it 
takes a relatively short time (relative to 107 seconds) to reach the critical concentration.

For  this  diameter, we  have  finally moved  into  the  regime where  all  droplets  react  and  reach  the  critical 
concentration.    You  will  also  see  that  the  ensemble  average  has  converged  to  the  mean  value,  and  the 
statistics are valid for  the standard deviation and CI’s  in  the mean.   However, we are still quite  far  from 
the continuum value of ~1 hr for the time to failure, with the MC value estimated to be ~30 times longer, 
+/- about 1%. 

The  histogram  story  is much  the  same, with  the  linear mean  doing  a  poor  job  at  predicting  the  peak  in 
the distribution.

We have now nearly converged to the continuum value, being only about 50% too large in terms of time 
to  critical  concentration.    The  distribution  has  also  become  narrower  and more  skewed,  since  it  is  now 
abutting  the  “hard”  lower  limit  of  ~3000  seconds  for  time.    The  linear  average  has  also  started  to

For this large diameter (and many ROOH’s per droplet), we have achieved about 97% of the continuum 
value, with the confidence interval for the mean lying well within the 10% error that we desire.  This set 
of  data  points  (although  small,  40),  has  a  very  narrow  distribution,  and  the  arithmetic  average  is 
equivalent to the log-scale average.   

Summary of Part 2: 

When the continuum and Monte Carlo solution disagree, which is more accurate? 
In  general,  the MC  simulations will  give  you  a much  better  idea  of what  is  going  on  in  the  system  and 
yields  a  more  accurate  characteristic  time  to  failure  than  a  continuum  method,  when  the  number  of 
molecules  per  droplet  is  small.    They  should  converge  (as was  seen)  when  the  number  of  ROOH’s  get 
large.  This  is  especially  true  when  you  have  fractional  numbers  of  molecules  per  droplet,  and  the 
continuum  method  will  have  reaction  occurring,  even  when  there  should  be  zero  molecules  in  some 
droplets base on probabilities. 

Comment on the width of the distributions, and on how many trajectories need to be run to achieve good 
statistics on the mean and width of the distribution.   
There is not one correct answer for this question… 
The  widths  (on  a  log  scale…  it  doesn’t  make  sense  to  take  about  them  on  a  linear  scale)  depended 
mainly  on  how  close  the  mean  was  to  the  “hard”  walls  at  3x103  and  1x107  seconds.    If  the  mean  was 
close  to  one  of  these  walls  (especially  the  lower  wall),  the  distribution  would  tend  to  be  relatively 
narrow and be skewed away from the “wall.”  When the mean was near the upper “wall,” the tail tended

to  be  longer, making  the  distribution  wider.   When  the mean  value  was  located  away  from  both  walls, 
the width of the distribution tended to be about 2 orders-of-magnitude.   

The number of trajectories needed to achieve good statistics on the mean can be fairly well determine by 
using  the  confidence  interval  discussed  earlier.    There  are  certain  assumptions  about  the  distribution 
being Gaussian (which are not strictly  true for  this system), but for a first-order estimate, it is sufficient. 
You  can  see  that  for  all  cases  (expect  for  D  =  30  nm),  the  confidence  interval  in  the  mean  value  was 
relatively  small  (less  than  5%).    This  indicates  that  the  number  of  steps  run  was  sufficient  to  achieve 
good statistics on the mean.  The width is somewhat more difficult to characterize.  One simple way is to 
examine the distribution graphically, and if it looks relatively smooth, then you can be confident that the 
width is pretty well converged.  A more rigorous way would be try to find the confidence interval for the 
standard deviation using higher-order moments of the distribution.   

How large does the diameter need to be in order to reach within 10% of the continuum solution? 
The  figure  below  shows  the  convergence  of  the  MC  simulation  with  the  continuum  value  for  varying 
diameters.  Although data for diameters of 1500 and 2000 nm would be useful, we can fairly confidently 
say  that  the  MC  solution  will  reach  within  10%  of  the  continuum  somewhere  between  1250  and 
2000 nm.  Given the shape of the curve, it is likely that the value is closer to 1250 nm.

Part 3: 250 nm droplet – dependence on k 

The  figure  below  shows  the  dependence  of  the mean  rate  of  failure  (dots)  on  k,  for  k  =  1Æ1000.  The 
99%  confidence  intervals  on  the  mean  values  are  shown  as  well  with  triangles.    It  shows  a  pretty 
interesting  trend,  with  an  increase  in  the  rate  from  small  to  intermediate  values  of  k,  and  then  a  sharp 
decrease as k increases further.   

The  sharp  decrease  at  large  values  is  easy  to  explain.    The  k-value  can  essentially  be  thought  of  as  the 
diffusivity  of  the  ROO  molecule,  and  as  it  increases,  the  molecule  has  a  large  chance  of  reaching  the 
edge  of  the  droplet  and  reacting  via  reaction  4  (ROO  Æ  ROOH).  When  ROO  get  to  the  edge  and 
converts  to  ROOH,  then  the  very  slow  initiation  reaction must  happen  again  to  regenerate  the  catalyst. 
For  a  droplet  that  only  has  a  few molecules  in  it,  this  is  important  and  can  significantly  affect  the  rate. 
This  serves  to  slow  the propagation  reaction  (ROO Æ ROO + ROOH) by  taking  some ROO molecules 
out of circulation.  This, on average, slows the rate of failure. 

The  initial  increase  is  likely  due  to  a  more  subtle  effect  cause  by  the  edge.    This  may  be  due  to  the 
competition  between  the  recombination  pathway  (2  ROO Æ  inert)  and  the  edge  pathway.    Essentially, 
increasing  the  likelihood  of  having  the  edge  reaction  occur  will  decrease  the  likelihood  of  the 
recombination  happening.    Since  the  recombination  is  relatively  worse  (since  it  eliminates  2  ROO’s 
instead of 1), the net result is a benefit.  The easiest way to understand this is with an example: 

Assume  you  have  a  droplet with  4 ROO’s,  and  k  is  such  that:  rprop =  0.989,  rrecomb =  0.01,  redge =  0.001. 
In this case, you have a 1% chance of killing 2 ROO’s, and a 0.1% chance of converting 1 ROO into an 
ROOH.  If  one  of  these  undesirable  side  reactions  happens,  it  will  likely  be  the  recombination.    The 
result will be 2 ROO’s left in the droplet.  Suppose k increases by a factor of 10, so that now redge = 0.01. 
Now  you  have  an  equal  chance  of  killing  2  ROO’s,  or  convert  1  into  an  ROOH.    The  latter  is  a  much 
better result since you only  lose 1 ROO and add  to  the pool of ROOH as well (it will also create an odd 
number of ROO’s in the droplet, which may be beneficial, as discussed below).  Also, with this increase 
in k, you have only had a minor effect  the propagation  rate.    If k  increases by another  factor of 10,  then 
nearly 10% of  the  time  the edge  reaction will happen, which will  results  in a  significant decrease  in  the 
overall production of ROOH (i.e. the beginning of the sharp decrease at large k-values). 

Another  reason  for  the  initial  increase  could  have  to  do with  the  differences  created when  you  have  an 
odd or  even number of ROO’s  in  the droplet.   Since ROO’s  are  always  created  in  pairs,  and  pairs must 
be present  to convert 2 ROO’s  into an  inert,  it would be beneficial  to have  an odd number of ROO’s  to 
ensure all ROO’s cannot be converted into inerts.  When diffusion is slow, it is difficult to reach the odd 
ROO state, since you would more often have two ROO recombine than have one reach the edge.  When 
two  are  present,  you  have  the  benefit  of  having  2x  the  propagation  rate,  but  face  the  chance  of 
recombining  and  having  to  undergo  the  slow  initiation  reaction  again.    If  you  have  one  diffuse  to  the 
edge,  you  have  only  one  ROO  left  to  run  the  propagation  reaction,  but  it  can  work  carefree  without 
worrying about being annihilated.  However, if the diffusion gets too fast, then the last ROO can diffuse 
to the edge and the chain reaction will be quenched (causing the sharp decline at large values of k). 

Both of these scenarios will contribute to the behavior seen in the plot below.
