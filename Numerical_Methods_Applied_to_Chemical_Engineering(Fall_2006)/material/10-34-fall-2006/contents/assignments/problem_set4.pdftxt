Homework #4

(Turn in hard copies in class or at the TA help session Monday evening.) 

Problem 1: 
Do problem 3.A.3 in Beers’s textbook. 

Problem 2: 
The heat capacity of many organic molecules is dominated by the torsions or 
internal-rotations about C-C single bonds, but unfortunately this is a bit 
tricky to calculate. Often a good approach is to first find the eigenvalues {E} 
of this 1-D Schrödinger equation: 
−h 2 
d 2Ψ 
( )   ( )  φ = E 
( )  
+ V  φ Ψ 
Ψ φ
⋅ 
8π2 I d φ2 

Eq.(1)

where φ, which runs from 0 to 2π, is the dihedral angle between substituents 
on the two carbon atoms making the single bond, V(φ) is the potential energy 
associated with this torsional motion, and I is its effective reduced moment 
of inertia. With the {E}, one can then compute the heat capacity using the 
statistical-mechanics formula

which you will see soon in 10.40 and again in the Spring in 10.65.  The 
potential energy function V(φ) is typically obtained by computing V at a 
half-dozen values of φ using quantum chemistry techniques, e.g. 

φ  0

For the case of Nmax = 4, a least-squares fitting yields the following: 
y4  = 0.678) × 10−20  Joules 
( y0  = 2.067 
y3  = −1.767 
y2  = 1.056 
y1  = −2.033 

It is very convenient to convert the Schrödinger equation from a differential 
equation into a linear algebra equation by searching for solutions where  

Ψ ( )φ  ∼ ∑ xm exp ( i m⋅  φ) 

( M  − 1 , ) M  Eq.(4) 
m = −M , − ( M  − 1  , ..., 
)

(a) Write the linear algebra equation that corresponds to Equation 1. 
[Hint: multiply through by exp(-ipφ) and integrate over φ].  Give an 
algebraic expression for the (m,n)th element in the matrix, assuming 
V(φ) is given exactly by Eq.(3). 
(b) Write a Matlab function that makes use of your answer in part A to 
compute the energy values E corresponding to Eqn. 1, taking in the 
moment of inertia, I, and the number of basis functions, M.  For the 
case of I = 3x10-45 kg-m2 and M = 50, calculate the zero point energy 
of the system (you do not need to show all of the eigenvalues).  Make 
a plot showing V(φ) from 0 to 2π, with a horizontal line shown on the 
plot for each eigenvalue of the system. 
(c) Write a set of Matlab functions which cumulatively compute C(T,M) 
using expansions Eq.(4) for the case I = 3x10-45 kg-m2.  Calculate the 
value of the heat capacity for M = 100 at 300 K (in J/mol-K). 
(d) Make a plot of C(T) from T = 100 K to T = 2000 K for a series of M’s 
to show how the calculation converges as M is increased.  Use the 
following values of M: 20, 50, 100, 300, and 500.  Plot the curves. 

N.B. The smallest E value you obtain is called the “zero-point energy”. 
Quantum mechanically it is impossible to remove the zero-point energy 
from the torsional degree of freedom, so even at T = 0 K the atoms in the 
molecule are not quite stationary.  The zero-point energy depends on the 
value of “I”, and hence on the masses of the atoms in the molecule.  This 
mass-dependence leads to small differences between the enthalpies and 
hence chemistry of different isotopes of the same molecule.  Also note that 
for a given M and I, the energy values do not change, meaning that the 
eigenvalue problem only needs to solved once to calculate an entire C(T) 
curve.  It may be useful to recall that: 
e i nφ + e − i nφ 
cos (
)φ =
