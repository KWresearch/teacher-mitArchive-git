Homework #10 
Due Date: Friday, December 1st, 2006 – 9 AM 

**  Note:  Please  read  the  entire  problem  set  before  starting,  there  is  important 
information  throughout,  even  at  the  very  end.  For  this  problem,  you  do  NOT  need  to 
have  the  Matlab  code  generate  all  of  the  results  for  part  A-E  by  running  it  once. 
However,  it  should  be  able  to  take  a  temperature  and  number  of  points  and  generate  all 
of the desired plots for that set of inputs.   

The most popular way  to experimentally  test a proposed geometrical  structure  for a  large 
molecule  (such  as  a  protein)  is  by  X-ray  crystallography.  However,  some  proteins  are 
hard to crystallize; for these proteins, proposed geometrical structures can be tested using 
nuclear  magnetic  resonance  (NMR).  NMR  measures  the  through-space  magnetic 
coupling  between  two  atoms  which  are  not  directly  bonded  to  each  other;  this  magnetic 
coupling  is  proportional  to  <1/R6>, where R  is  the  distance  between  the  two  atoms.  The 
symbol < > means  the Boltzmann  average  over  all  the  possible molecular  geometries;  in 
the  classical  limit  and  neglecting  some  minor  complications  due  to  the  integral  over  the 
kinetic energy we can write:

This  high-dimensional  integral  can  be  computed  for  a  proposed  structure  using  Monte 
Carlo techniques. Of course for a molecule with a large number of atoms this can be quite 
challenging. Here we instead ask you to compute this integral for a small molecule. 

Note  that  it  is  very  easy  to  figure  out  the  equilibrium  geometry  from  this  analytical 
expression  for  V  (note  V = 0  at  the  equilibrium  geometry).  We  suggest  you  use 
Metropolis’s method, and start your Monte Carlo steps from the equilibrium geometry. 

6> 
Write a  set of Matlab  functions which use Monte Carlo  integration  to compute <1/RHH
at a given Temperature, where RHH is the distance between the two H atoms in HOOH.  

A.  Determine  the  equilibrium  structure  at  0  K  of  HOOH  by  minimizing  the 
potential  energy  of  HOOH.    Plot  the  structure  of  the  molecule  in  3-D  using 
the  plot3  command  in  Matlab.    State  the  0  K  equilibrium  values  for 
6> and <RHH>  in Angstroms.   Do you expect  the value of <RHH>  to be 
<1/RHH
different for T = 300 K, why?

B.  Use  your  code  to  solve  for  the  value  of <1/RHH
6>,  the  value  of  <RHH>,  and  the  number  of Monte Carlo 
obtained  for  <1/RHH
steps attempted and accepted. 

C.  Plot the 3-D location of all of the MC points obtained in the above simulation 
using  the  plot3  command  again.  It  may  also  be  instructive  to  plot  the 
equilibrium  structure  underneath  the  MC  points.    This  can  be  done  with 
something like (obviously, this syntax will need to be modified to your problem): 
plot3(equil,’-‘,’linewidth’,4.0); 

hold on;

plot3(MC_points,’.’);

hold off; 


D.  Repeat this to generate plots for temperatures of 600 K, 1000 K, and 5000 K. 
Generate  these  plots  with  a  minimum  of  10000  MC  steps.    Generate  a 
histogram  of  the  <RHH>  values  for  each  temperature,  using  the  same  x-axis 
scale  for  all  figures.    Also  create  a  histogram  (50  bins)  showing  the 
distribution  of  potential  energies  that  the  molecule  adopts  for  each 
temperature  (you don’t need  to use  the same x-axis scale).   Find  the bin with 
the largest frequency and compare this energy value with the value of kBT. 

6>  as  the 
E.  Generate  a  plot  for  each  T  showing  the  evolution  of  the  <1/RHH
number of MC points increases (ideally this curve will converge to the actual 
value of as N Æ ∞ ). 

F.  For  your  answer  in  part  B,  give  your  best  guess  at  the  uncertainty  in  your

The  R’s  are  Cartesian  distances  between  the  atoms.  θHOO  is  the  angle  defined  by 
H1-O1-O2  and θOOH  is  the  angle  defined  by O1-O2-H2  (you  can  compute  these  using  law 
of cosines). An expression for the dihedral angle φis given below.

Hint: Molecule fixed axes 
Molecular potentials V do not depend on the position of the molecule in space, nor on its 
orientation,  but  only  on  the  relative  position  of  the  atoms.  Hence  one  can  usually  cut  6 
degrees  of  freedom  (corresponding  to  the  position  of  the  molecule  and  its  angular 
orientation  (Euler  angles))  out  of  molecular  problems.  In  this  particular  problem,  we 
suggest using molecule-fixed axes where the position of atom O1 sets the origin, atom O2 
lies on the x axis, and atom H1 lies in the x-y plane. Then one can remove these 6 degrees 
of  freedom  from  the  problem:    (xO1,yO1,zO1,yO2,zO2,zH1).  (You  can  set  them  all  equal  to 
zero). When you remove the orientational degrees of freedom you pick up some Jacobian 
volume  elements; 
including 
these 
the  new  expression  for 
the 
integral  (again 
approximating away some minor terms related to rotational kinetic energy) is:

One  other  point  of  interest  how  to  move  around  this  multi-dimensional  space,  and  the 
step sizes to take.  When you are moving atoms around in 3-D Cartesian space (not using 
internal  coordinates),  you  are  not  very  well  constrained  along  the  normal  modes  of  the 
atom,  i.e. you have a small chance of making a  large  jump  from one  low energy position 
to another.  For example, consider a water molecule with  the O centered at  (0,0), one H1 
at  (0,y1),  and  H2  at  (x2,y2).  A  reasonable  structure  would  have  H1  at  (0,1)  and  H2  at 
(0.95,-0.3).  However, an equally plausible structure would have H2 at (-0.95,-0.3).  So if 
one  was  doing  a  MC  simulation,  with  a  random  step  of  <  2  in  x  and  y,  then  you  could 
imagine  that  you  may  “hop”  from  one  node  to  the  other,  since  they  are  energetically 
equivalent.  However,  this  is  rare  because  all  3  variables  must  step  the  appropriate 
amounts:  y1  step must  be  small,  y2  step must  be  small,  and  x2 must  be  about  -1.9.   The 
odds  of  all  of  these  conditions  happening  during  the  same  step  are  low,  so  many  MC 
steps  may  be  needed  to  “hop”  between  nodes.   You  will  also  have  to  reject  a  large 
number of steps because many steps would lead to very large energy values.   

This leaves two options for Cartesian simulations: 
1.	 Take  small  steps  which  will  be  accepted  more  often,  and  will  give  reliable 
information about  the areas of  similar energy  that are not separated by significant 
barriers.  This will not allow you to probe multiple low energy wells separated by 
large barriers.

2.	 Take  large  steps  that  will  be  rejected  most  of  the  time  (thus  not  give  you  very 
good  statistics),  but  will  allow  for  the  possibility  of  finding  other  low-energy 
features  that are far away or separated by  large barriers.   This can be useful when 
trying to minimize a function with many local minima. 

A  better  method  for  molecules  would  be  to  take  steps  in  internal  coordinates  (bond 
lengths,  bond  angles,  and  dihedral  angles),  so  that  you  can  better  probe  the  feasible 
positions  of  the  atoms  because  realistic  step  constraints  can  be more  easily  defined  than 
with  Cartesian  coordinates.  It  is NOT  necessary  to  solve  this  problem  using  internal 
coordinates.  We  suggest  taking  small  random  steps with  a maximum  displacement 
in each direction of 0.10 Å.  If you use another method  to probe phase  space, please 
state it explicitly.
