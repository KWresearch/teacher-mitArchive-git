Monte Carlo Sampling within a molecular potential 

The purpose of this problem was to take a representative sampling of molecular configurations at 
a  given  temperature  for  the  given molecular  potential.    Proper  sampling  from  the  probability  of 
the molecule having a certain amount of energy will allow for average quantities to be estimated, 
6> and <RHH> asked for in the problem statement. 
such as the <1/RHH

This could be done using  internal coordinates of  the molecules, but was essentially given  to you 
in  terms  of  Cartesian  coordinates  in  the  problem.    The  pertinent  equation  for  the  average  of 
interest was  given  by  the  following  equation.    In  this  equation,  several  degrees  of  freedom  have 
been  removed  by  assuming  a  fixed  position  of  one  oxygen  atom  (O1),  the  other  oxygen  (O2) 
only  moves  along  one  dimension,  and  that  one  H  atom  (H1)  is  confined  to  a  2-D  plane.    This 
leaves  a  6-D  phase  space  to  be  probed,  which  in  Cartesian  coordinates  can  be  written  as  the 
following variables: xO2, xH1, yH1, xH2, yH2, and zH2.

It  is  easy  to  see  that  the  weighting  function  in  this  case  is  a  modified  Boltzmann  distribution, 
which was modified because the degrees of freedom were reduced.  This weighting function will 
then  be  used  in  the Metropolis  algorithm  to  accept  or  reject  steps.   The  acceptance  criterion  for 
an uphill step in energy is given by:

Generally, a downhill step in energy is always accepted and this formula is not used (you can see 
that  for  a  pure  Boltzmann  factor,  a  downhill  step  will  always  be  accepted  with  the  above 
formula).  However, this criterion could also be used in this case for a downhill step, and for very 
small  downhill  steps  in  energy,  there  could  be  a  small  chance  of  rejecting  the  step  based  the 
geometry ratio pre-factor.   

Now  that  the  acceptance  criterion  is  defined,  we  can  begin  to  take  steps.    In  this  problem,  each 
coordinate could be changed independently by +/- 0.10 Å.

Part A: 
Equilibrium value at 0 K:
<R_HH> = 2.5836 (Angstroms)
<1/R_HH^6> = 0.0033623 (1/A^6) 

Number of MC steps taken: 100000 

One  would  expect  that  the  equilibrium  0  K 
distance  and  the  <distance>  at  elevated  are 
different,  though  the  difference may  be  small. 
The main  reason  why  this  would  be  the  case  is 
due  to  asymmetries  in  the  potentials  within  the 
molecule.  As  the  temperature  increases,  the atoms can move  to  locations of higher energy, with 
a  probability  that  depends  on  T.  A  very  much  simplified  (an  rigorously  incorrect)  way  of 
envisioning this would be to assume that the molecule can exist on a single iso-energy contour at 
a  given  temperature.  Only  if  this  iso-energy  contour  was  symmetric  about  the  0  K  minimum, 
would  you  expect  the  average  value  to  be  centered  on  the  0 K  position  for  Npoints  Æ  large.  A 
simple  example  is  shown  below.  If  you  have  a  circular  contour  around  (0,0)  and  could  sample 
anywhere  along  the  circle,  you  would  find  that  the  <(x,y)>=  (0,0).  However,  if  the  shape  is 
asymmetric  (as  are  the  potentials  in  this  problem),  you  will  find  some  other  value  for  <(x,y)>, 
denoted by the “X” in the images below, even if the true minimum lies at (0,0).  The value would 
lie at the average position of all points along the contour (in this simple case).

an estimate of the uncertainty in the average value, though they differ by significant amounts.

At 300 K,  the atoms are confined  to a  rather  limited energy and physical  space.   This  is because 
the small thermal energy available makes significant uphill steps very unlikely.  You should also 
be  able  to  see  that  the  <RHH>  value  is  slightly  larger  that  at  0  K  due  to  the  asymmetry  in  the 
dihedral  potential.  The  barrier  at  the  “trans”  configuration  is  smaller  than  the  “cis”  barrier, 
making the potential less steep for H atoms moving away from each other.  This is similar to the 
simple example shown above.   

The  H-H  distance  is  fairly  sharply  peaked,  as  would  be  expected  for  a  low  temperature.    The 
most  frequently  seen  value  of  the  potential  is  found  to  be  near  the  thermal  energy  of  the  system 
(kBT),  as  would  be  expected.    It  is  not  exactly  the  same,  but  we  are  not  sampling  from  a  pure 
Boltzmann  distribution,  we  have  discrete  bin  sizes,  and  cannot  do  an  infinite  number  of  points. 
Generally, one would expect these values to be close to each other.

At  600  K,  the  trends  are  the  same  as  what  was  said  for  the  300  K  case.    However,  now  the  H 
atoms can sample a  larger energy and physical space.   The <RHH> value at 600 K  is even  larger, 
as would be expected. 

The distribution is slightly broader, as would be expected with the higher temperature.

Again,  in  this  case  the  <RHH>  is  even  larger  and  the  asymmetry  in  the  dihedral  potential  can  be 
seen  easily.  At  1000  K,  there  was  enough  energy  available  to  traverse  the  “trans”  barrier  and 
create the mirror-image molecule with the H2 atom on the opposite side of the x-y plane.   

The distribution has become slightly broader for the H-H distance.

At  5000  K,  things  become  strange  because  there  is  enough  energy  available  to  break,  or  nearly 
break, the O-H bonds.  In the figures below, you can see that the bonds break, but the atoms find 
their ways back into the wells again.  The energy is also high enough that nearly all values of the 
dihedral angle can be sampled equally well (this would essentially act like a free rotor).   

This distribution in this case is very wide, since such a large range of energies and geometries are 
accessible with a reasonably high probability.

This  is  an  example  at  5000 K where  the O-H  bond was  essentially  broken,  and  the H  atom was 
free  to  roam  around  on  a  nearly  flat  energy  surface.    It  does  not  appear  to  have  found  its  way 
back into the minimum energy well at the end of 100000 steps.  This obviously will not give you 
any meaningful information, other than the fact that the molecule is unstable at such high T’s.

The  distributions  are  interesting  in  this  case  because  of  the  strange  behavior.    There  is  still  a 
sharp peak in H-H between 2 and 3 Å, but there are also a large range of distances present due to 
the  broken  bond.  You  can  also  see  the  bimodal  energy  distribution.    The  lower  energy  peak 
corresponds  to  the distribution  for a molecule confined within  the molecular potential, while  the 
higher energy peak corresponds  to  the molecule after  the O-H bond has been broken.    In  reality, 
once  the  bond  has  been  broken,  the  supplied  potential  is  no  longer  valid,  since  the  angular  and 
dihedral potentials given would only be valid  for  tightly bound  atoms  in covalent bonds, but  the 
behavior is interesting nonetheless.

6> as the number of points increases for a single MC “trajectory” 
Results for <RHH

These  results  are  for  the  average  value  along  the  entire  MC  sampling  “trajectory.”    The  word 
trajectory  is used very  loosely here since MC does not attempt  to  trace a  true dynamic  trajectory 
in time, but only samples randomly in space. 

You  can  see  that  the  behavior  at  300  K,  600  K,  and  1000  K  is  relatively  well-confined  to  a 
narrow  region.  This  is  because  the  atoms  are  confined  to  a  relatively  narrow  range  of  the 
physical  space  defined  the  molecular  potential.    You  can  also  see  that  the  high  temperatures 
6>.  This is somewhat counter-intuitive because we also 
typically result in larger values of <1/RHH
think  that  the  <RHH>  should  increase  with  temperature.    However,  the  larger  values  of  the  H-H 
6> because they are raise to the 6th power. 
distance contribute much less to <1/RHH

What  is  happening  is  that  at  higher  temperatures,  you  can  have  H-H  values  that  are  both  larger 
and  smaller  that  the  equilibrium  distance  (or  at  a  smaller  temperature).    Due  to  the  asymmetric 
potential  you  can  go  farther  to  increase  H-H  than  you  can  to  decrease  H-H  (e.g.  if  the 
equilibrium  H-H  is  2.6  Å,  then  at  600  K,  maybe  you  can  range  from  2.4  to  3.0  Å).    This  will 
definitely  increase  the  value  of  <RHH>  with  increasing  temperature.    However,  since  the  small 
6> value, the ability to add some smaller H-H 
values of H-H will count much more in the <1/RHH
values  is much more  important  to  the average value  than adding  larger values  (even  if  the  larger 
H-H values correspond to a larger displacement than the smaller ones).   

The behavior at 5000 K shown here  is strange, as expected.   The molecule must have seen some 
very  small  H-H  distances  at  the  beginning  that  made  the  function  average  large,  and  then 
returned to more normal behavior as the number of points increased.   

As a side note and along the same lines, you should also realize that:
