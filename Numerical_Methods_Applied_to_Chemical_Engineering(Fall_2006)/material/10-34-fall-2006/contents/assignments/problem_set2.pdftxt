Due Date: Wednesday, Sept. 20th, 2006 – 9 AM 
 
Problem 1:  Linear Regression 
Complete problem 1.B.2 in Beers’ textbook (page 82).  Submit a graph with the rate 
data and fitted expression on the same plot, along with the values of the parameters 
determined by the linear regression. 

 
Problem 2:  Fitting heat capacity data sets using various functional forms 
Part A:  
Complete problem 1.A.3 in Beers’ textbook. 
       
Part B:  
Apply your function calc_poly_coeff.m to interpolate between the following 
data for the heat capacity (CV [=] cal/mole-K) of CO2 using the following polynomial 
form:

CV
i.e. write a function Cv = Cv_CO2_poly(T,T_data,Cv_data) that takes in a 
vector of T values and returns estimates of the corresponding CV(T) vector, given the 
data vectors for temperature and CV.  Note that in this special case, Ndata = Nparam, so 
the parameters are determined by solving a linear system (not regression). 
 
These sorts of interpolations are needed for estimating the thermodynamic properties 
of gases. (In fact, often we need to extrapolate to predict the behavior of gases at very 
high T, where it is difficult or impossible to measure the properties directly.)   Report 
the parameter values determined for the polynomial.  Also report the condition 
X in

Part C: 
As T gets very high, it is known that molecular heat capacities are asymptote to 
values predicted by classical mechanics.  For CO2, the asymptotic value is CV = 6.5R.  
Also, for CO2, the heat capacity is expected to be a monotonically increasing function 
of T.  Does your program Cv_CO2_poly.m give reasonable estimates?  Does it 
give accurate extrapolations at high temperature?

Write a program calc_Pade_coeff.m that determines a0, a1, a2, and a3 and a 
program Cv_CO2_Pade(T,T_data,Cv_data) that estimates the CV(T) of CO2 
using the Pade form. (Note that the Pade form can be posed as linear in the 
parameters, so a nonlinear solver is not needed)  Report the parameter values 
determined for the Pade form. Compare the two interpolations graphically, and make 
some comments regarding the accuracy of their interpolations and extrapolations.  
 
Part D: 
Suppose that the problem is posed in a slightly different way, such that the variable is 
converted from T (cid:198) T/1000.  The polynomial would be:

Using the previously written calc_poly_coeff.m, calculate the parameter values 
for this new scaled variable.  Are these the expected values given the previous 
solution with the variable T?  Calculate the condition number of the new linear 
system matrix.  Typically a very large condition number implies the problem is near-
singular and/or poorly scaled, which do you think is the problem in this case, and 
why? 
 
Part E: 
Suppose the CV data for CO2 were actually the following: 
Temp (K) 
300 
600 
900 
2200 
CV
6.91 
9.32 
10.68 
11.48 
Compare the interpolation and extrapolation abilities for this set of CV data by 
providing a plot comparing the polynomial and Pade forms.  Comment on the results 
in this case.

Problem 3:  Solving Linear Systems for “Real” System Problems 
 
Consider the reactor-separator esterification system discussed in class:

Reactor

Separator

6

 
Contrary to the idealized assumptions made in class, the separators are not perfect. The 
product stream 6 is actually a mixture of ester, acid, and acid. The steam stream 5 is 
actually a mixture of H2O and alcohol. There is some ester in the recycle stream. The 
input stream is a mix of H2O, alcohol and acid.  
 
The molecular weight of the alcohol is 32 g/mole. The molecular weight of the acid is 
176 g/mol. The reaction is acid + alcohol = H2O + ester. The symbols used for this 
problem are explained below. 
 
The symbols: 
Wi :   water mass flow rate in stream i. 
Aci:      Acid mass flow rate in stream i. 
Ali:      Alcohol mass flow rate in stream i. 
Ei:        Ester mass flow rate in stream i. 
Mi:      Total mass flow rate in stream i. 
Fi:      Total molar flow rate in stream i. 
 
 
The measurements available to you are: 
 

1)  The mass flow rates of Alcohol and Acid in the input stream. (Ac1, Al1) 
2)  The total molar flow rate of stream 3, stream 5 and stream 6. (F3, F5, F6) 
3)  Performing an IR spectroscopy gives the ratio of Acid and Alcohol in stream 4 
and stream 3. (r3, r4) 

 
All the measurements are good to 3 significant figures.

To ensure material compatibility, the system is always adjusted to maintain the 
concentration of acid in the recycle stream at 10.00 mass%. Also the separator extracts 
90% of ester from stream 3 into stream 6. 
 
Write a Matlab function which takes as its input a vector containing the 7 measured 
numbers (in order Ac1, Al1, F3, F5, F6, r3, r4) and constructs and solves the linear 
system of equations to compute the composition of all the streams. 
 

1.  Use your function to compute the composition of the recycle stream for the 
following cases: 
a)  Ac1 = 50.0 Kg/sec, Al1 = 10.0 Kg/sec, F3 = 1.20 Kmol/sec, F5 = 0.212 
Kmol/sec, F6 = 0.662 Kmol/sec, r3 = 1.93 and r4 = 0.157. 

 

 

 
 

Is there a unique solution to the problem?  

Also estimate the uncertainty in your answers due to the conditioning of the 
system of equations and the uncertainty in the measurements. 
 
2.  Now instead of the above measurements suppose someone made measurements of 
Mass flow rate of all the components in stream 1 and stream 6 (Ac1, Al1, W1, E6, 
Ac6, W6). The total mass flow rate of the recycle stream is provided (M4). The 
total molar flow rate of stream 5 is given F5.  
 
To ensure material compatibility, the system is always adjusted to maintain the 
concentration of acid in the recycle stream at 10.00 mass%.  
 
For these given inputs form the system of equations to solve for the composition 
of all the streams. Is there a unique solution to the problem? If so calculate the 
flow rates in the recycle stream for these sets of inputs. If not, why not? 
 
a)  Ac1 = 50.0 Kg/sec, Al1 = 10.0 Kg/sec, W1 = 5.00 Kg/sec, E6 = 29.7 Kg/mol, 
W6 = 6.81 Kg/mol, Ac6 = 22.5 Kg/sec, M4 = 20 Kg/sec and 
F5 = 0.212 Kmol/sec.

Problem 4:  Non-linear Reactor Design Problem 
Hydrogen is often produced from syngas (mixture of CO & H2) by the water gas shift 
reaction: 
 

CO + H2O (cid:217) H2 + CO2

 
in a catalytic reactor that can be modeled as a constant pressure, constant volume 
CSTR. The rate of the reaction in this reactor is given by this expression:

When doing the energy balance, you will need to consider the energy required to raise 
the temperature of the inlet to the reactor temperature.  For this purpose, estimate the 
heat capacity of the gaseous mixture using ideal-mixing:

and set the heat capacities of  CO and H2 to CP = 3.5R and H2O and CO2 to CP = 4R. 
Later we’ll discuss how to handle the fact that CP is actually a function of T. 
 
Write a Matlab function that takes as input the system pressure (in atm), the inlet gas 
temperature, and the mole fractions of the four gases in the inlet, and returns as output 
the reactor temperature and the product stream composition (use fsolve in your 
program): 
 
[xout,Treactor] = WaterGasShift(P,Tinlet,xinlet)

Test your function for the case: P = 10 atm, Tinlet = 700 K, xinlet, H2O = 0.8, 
xinlet, CO = 0.2.  Report the outlet mole fractions and the reactor temperature. 
 
Additionally, if you were designing this reactor for industrial use, you would be 
interested to know what operating conditions produced the most hydrogen.  You 
believe that your CrMoV-Steel vessel (and catalyst) can withstand inlet temperatures 
of up to 1500 K, which represents the physically-realizable operating conditions of 
the reactor.   
 
Using your function, determine the CO conversion as a function of Tinlet (use a vector 
of T’s from 500 K (cid:198) 1500 K in 25 K increments).   Plot the CO conversion vs. Tinlet 
and state maximum conversion and the corresponding Tinlet and Treactor values.  
Explain the low temperature and high temperature behaviors seen in the plot.  The 
pressure and inlet stream are the same as before. 
 
Comment on the stability of nonlinear problems/solvers and on the importance of the 
initial guess.  In your write-up for this problem, be sure to give the equations you 
solved and how you arrived at them.
