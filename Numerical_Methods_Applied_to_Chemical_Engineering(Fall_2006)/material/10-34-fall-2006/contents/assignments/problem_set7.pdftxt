Problem 1: 
Do problem 4.B.1 in Beers’ textbook (pg. 294). 
 
Problem 2: 
Do problem 5.B.4 in Beers’ textbook (pg. 357). 
 
Problem 3:  Equilibrium on a mixture of gases 
In  this  problem,  we  want  to  find  the  equilibrium  composition  of  a  mixture  of  gases  at 
constant T = 1000 K and P = 1 atm in the steam reforming of methane: 
 
 
 
If  you wanted  to  know  the  best  you  can  do  for  hydrogen  production,  you would  need  to 
know  the  equilibrium  composition  at  the  temperature  of  interest.    The  typical  solution 
procedure  to  this  type of problem  involves minimizing  the  total Gibbs  free  energy of  the 
system  by  changing  the  number  of  moles  of  the  species  in  the  system,  subject  to  the 
conservation of atoms. 
 
We  can  write  that  the  Gibbs  free  energy  of  the  system  is  a  function  of  T,  P,  and  the 
number of moles of the species, then differentiate to get the following:

Question: 
In  this  problem, we want  to  find  the  equilibrium  number  of moles  and mole  fraction  for 
the  following  species  in  the  steam  reforming  system: CH4, H2O, CO, CO2, HO2, H2,  and 
HOOH.  The Gibbs free energy values at 1000 K and 1 atm are (in J/mole): 
 
G
CH
G
CO
 
Part A: 
Consider  a  constant  T  and  P  equilibrium  reactor,  with  T  =  1000  K  and  P  =  1  atm.    The 
initial charge of reactants is: 2 moles CH4, 3 moles H2O, 0.5 moles CO, and 1 mole of H2.  
Give  the  number  of  moles  of  each  species  at  equilibrium,  as  well  as  the  corresponding 
mole fraction.   
 
Part B: 
The  species  HO2  is  a  radical  species  and  would  typically  be  found  in  very  small 
quantities.    What  would  be  the  approximate  number  of  moles  at  equilibrium  for  HO2 
estimated using  the concentrations of  the major species?   Does  the value  found using  the 
minimization make sense, explain?
