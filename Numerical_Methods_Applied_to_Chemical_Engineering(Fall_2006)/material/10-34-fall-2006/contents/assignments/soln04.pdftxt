Homework #4 - Solutions 

Problem 1:  Problem 3.A.3 in Beers’ textbook – Eigenvalue/vectors 

Part A:  (see page 150-151 in Beers) 

We  are  asked  is  any  of  the matrices  are  known  to  have  all  real  eigenvalues.   Matrices A  

can  be  visually  seen  to  have  only  real  eigenvalues,  this  is  because  it  is  a  real  symmetric  

matrix.  Matrix C can also be determined to have only real eigenvalues because: 

Trace(C) – 4*det(C) = 24 > 0 

This requires a small calculation, but not the actual calculation of the eigenvalues.   


Part B:  (see page 156-157 in Beers) 

The bounding of  the eigenvalues  involves  the use of Gershgorin’s Theorem, which states

that the eigenvalues of a matrix must lie within some range around the diagonal elements  

of the matrix.  More specifically: 

 ≤ ∑ 
λi  − akk
ak
= Γ k
 
elements  j ≠k

The summation is the sum of the modulus of all the off-diagonal elements for row k. 

j


Matrix A: 
Doing  this  analysis  for matrix A, we  find  that  the Gamma value  for  rows 1 – 4  are: 4, 5, 
2, and 5, respectively.  This results in the following bounds:

eigenvalue space, but the problem asked for an upper and lower bound.

Part C: 
For a unitary matrix, D-1 = DT.  So  if we can calculate  the  inverse and  show  it equals  the 
transpose,  then  D  is  unitary.    In  order  to  determine  the  inverse,  we  can  make  an 
augmented  matrix  to  solve  D*D-1  =  I.  Similar  to  the  idea  of  Gaussian  elimination,  we 
want to do row operations to turn D into I, and the matrix that was formerly I, will be the 
inverse of D.  To accomplish this, we only need to do two things: exchange rows 1 and 2; 
then multiply row 2 by -1.  The results are shown below.

By visual inspection, you can see that D-1 does equal DT. 

Part D:  (see page 149 in Beers) 

For  this  part,  we  are  asked  to  calculate  the  eigenvalue  and  unit  eigenvector  by  hand  (a  

very useful skill to have in the day and age).   


To  solve  this,  we  can  use  the  determinant  of  (C  – λI).  The  following  expression  will  

allow for the eigenvalues to be determined: 

c11  − λ  c12
det (C − λI ) = 0 = 
= ( c11  − λ) ( c22  − λ) − c21 c12
c21 
c22  − λ 
We  can  expand  to  get  the  following  quadratic,  and  the  resulting  use  of  the  quadratic 
formula will yield: 
(  11 
22 )
(  11 22

λ1,2  = 
2 
Plugging into the matrix elements, we find that the eigenvalues are: 
λ1  = 3.4495 
λ2  = − 1.4495 
To  solve  for  the  unit  eigenvector,  you  can  solve  the  following  equations  with  the 
constraint of unit length: 
⎤ ⎡ w1, j  ⎤
c12 
⎡c11  − λj

⎥ ⎢ 
⎥ 
⎢ 
c22  − λj ⎦ ⎣ w2 , j ⎦ 
⎣  c21

Since  the  two  equations  are  dependent  (the  matrix  is  singular),  you  can  only  use  one 
equation, and then an arbitrary equation to determine the vector length (unit in our case). 
( c11  − λj ) w1, j  + c12 w2 , j  = 0 
and  w1, j  + w2 , j  = 1 
2

To  solve  this,  solve  the  first  equation  for  w2,j,  and  insert  in  the  second  equation.  The 
following are the solutions:

1 Problem  2 

(a) To solve the schrodinger equation we use the basis set bm (φ) = exp(imφ). 
For  our  particular  case  we  can  convert  the  operator  Hˆ from  function 
�  2π 
space  into  an matrix H  by  using  the  formula 
1 
∗  H bl (φ)dφ

Hk ,l  = 

Here  Hk ,l  is  the  k ,  l  element  of  the  matrix  H  and  the  operator  Hˆ is 
given  by  the  equation 

Hˆ = − 
h2  d2

8π 2 I dφ2

Lets  ﬁrst  calculate  the matrix  elements  of  the  diﬀerential  operator

In the above equation δlk  is the kronecker-delta function which is 1 when 
l  = 
k  or  0  when  l  = 
k .  This  kronecker-delta  function  ensures  that  for 
the  diﬀerntial  operator  only  the  diagonal  elements  are  non-zero,  the 
rest  of  the  elements  are  0.

V (φ) =

Now let us calculate the matrix elements of V (φ) part of the Hˆ operator. 
But  before  we  do  that  we  will  ﬁrst  write  V (φ)  in  a  more  convenient 
� 
form

This  form  of  writing  the  potential  function  is  much  more  convenient 
when  we  are  integrating  it  between  the  basis  functions  to  calculate 
the  matrix  elements.  Now  let  us  proceed  to  calculation  of  the  matrix 
elements  of  the  potential  V (φ).

Again  the  kronecker-delta  function  appears  in  the  expression.  The  po­
tential  function  populates  the  non-diagonal  elements  and  the  diagonal 
elements  of  the matrix H . 
Based on the values of k , l element of the diﬀerential and the V  operator 
we  realize  can  write  the  the  elements  of H  matrix  as  follows

The  overall  size  of  the  matrix  H  is  dependent  on  the  number  of  basis 
functions  used.  For  2M  + 1  basis  functions  the  size  of  the  matrix  will 
be  2M  + 1 × 2M  + 1.  The  accuracy  of  the  solution  will  improve  with 
the  increase  in  the  basis  functions.  The  solution  will  be  perfect  when 
M  becomes  inﬁnity. 
In the matrix space the schrodinger equation just boils down to solving 
the  eigenvalue  problem  of  the  system.  Each  eigenvalue  of  the  system 
corresponds  to  a  energy  state  of  the  system.

(b)	 Using  the  above  derived  rule  to  calculate  the  elements  of  the  matix

(c)   In  this  problem  we  make  use  of  the  code

energy  states  of  the  system.  Once  the  energies  of  the  system  are  eval­
uated we  can  calculate  the heat  capacity without much  diﬃculty  using

(c) Once we have written the program that calculates the heat capacities of 
the  system,  we  can  loop  over  the  program  to  calculate  the  heat  capac­
ities  for  at  various  temperatures  and  values  of  M.  (Please  note,  for  a 
given value of M the energy states of the system do not change.  Thus to 
calculate the heat capacities at diﬀerent  temperatures  for a given value 
of  M,  we  only  need  to  solve  the  eigenvalue  problem  once.  Calculating 
the  eigenvalues  of  the  H  matrix  is  the  slowest  step  of  the  system  and 
should  be  avoided  as  much  as  possible).  Look  at  the  implementation 
of  code problem3d.  A  sample  input  and output  is  given  below  and  the 
graph  is  also  presented  at  the  end  of  the  solution.
