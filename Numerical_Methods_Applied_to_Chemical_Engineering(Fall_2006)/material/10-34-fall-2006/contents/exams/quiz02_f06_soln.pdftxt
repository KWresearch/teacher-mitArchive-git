10.34 Quiz 2 
November 15, 2006 

An isomerase (an enzyme that catalyzes an isomerization reaction) is used to convert a 
cheap unpalatable substrate S into its isomer, a delicious high-value product P called 
fructose (used to make soft drinks and candy). 

The enzyme reaction is expected to follow the Michaelis-Menton rate law:

Eq.(1)


where Vm and Km depend on the enzyme, and Keq is for the equilibrium S=P, and nE is 
the moles of enzyme in the reactor. 

Note that throughout the isomerization process [S]+[P] = constant. We therefore suggest 
you use the dimensionless concentration C = [Substrate]/[Substrate]o rather than 
tracking S and P separately. 

1) Simulate the batch conversion of S into P by writing a couple of short Matlab 
functions. Your Matlab functions should take [S]o, nE, V, Km, and Keq as inputs. Feel 
free to call any built-in Matlab functions.  

A microreactor for accomplishing this process continuously is constructed this way: 
a coating of the isomerase is chemically bonded to two flat plates. The coating density is 
10-11 moles enzyme/cm2. The two plates are then bonded to a thin spacer, to create a very 
thin channel (gap between the plates Y=0.01 cm (0.005 cm from the centerline to the 
wall), length X=5 cm, width of channel Z=2 cm), see figure. Inside the channel, flow can 
be accurately modeled as being laminar and two-dimensional, i.e. we only need to be 
concerned about gradients in x and y directions, not z, don’t worry about what happens 
close to z=0 or z=Z.  The enzyme’s substrate, initial concentration [S]o is flowed at a rate 
of 0.1 ml/second through the channel from x=0, and the output stream (hopefully rich in 
product P) exits at x=X. 

2) Write the finite difference equations that can be solved to compute Ci = C(xi,yi) at a set 
of Nx*Ny mesh points (xi,yi) inside the channel when the system is running in steady 
state, in the limit where the enzyme reaction is so fast that the Substrate and Product are 
in equilibrium at the walls. That is, at the inlet C=1, and along the walls C = (1+Keq)-1. At 
the outlet assume von Neumann boundary conditions. What is the boundary condition 
along the centerline of the channel Y=0 cm? Write the special equations that apply for the 
mesh points at or near the boundaries (the centerline is one of the boundaries).

3) Is the system of equations you wrote in part 2 linear or nonlinear in the unknowns? 
What Matlab function would you use to solve this system of equations?  

4) It would be interesting to compute values of X,Y,Z which would maximize the yield, 
i.e. the moles of P made per second, subject of course to a couple of practical constraints: 
a)  safety: the total pressure drop cannot exceed some maximum set by our pump 
and the materials used to construct the microreactor. 
b) product specifications: the [P] in the output stream must be at least [P]min 

Explain whether or not one should expect this maximum productivity to occur at the 
point where: 

∂(yield)/∂X = 0 

and 

∂(yield)/∂Y = 0 

and 

∂(yield)/∂Z = 0 

Note no computations are required, just a sentence or two. 

5) In reality, the enzymatic reaction will not be fast enough to achieve perfect equilibrium 
at the walls. Instead, the rate of conversion per unit area at the walls will be (with nE now 
being in moles Enzyme/cm2) 

(moles converted /second/ cm2) = R 

Eq.(3) 

Write the new boundary condition at the walls that replaces C=(1+Keq)-1 and the 
corresponding finite difference equation for a point (xn,yn) near the wall.  

6) If you were solving the BVP problem using non-uniform grid points, where would you 
want to make the density of grid points the largest?  Explain with a sentence or to why 
that is the case.

1.  Let  us  assume  that  the  volume  of  the  reactor  is  VR .  Then  the  rate  of 
the  reaction,  R  is  given  in  Equation(1). 
⎛
⎞ 
R = nE Vm ⎝

(1) 

But the rate of the reaction is also equal to the rate of change of concen­
tration  of  the  substrate  (the  volume  of  the  reactor  remains  constant). 
Thus  the  diﬀerential  equation  that  we  have  to  solve  for  this  problem 
is  given  in  Equation(2).  For  the  given  diﬀerential  equation,  the  initial 
condition  is;  at  t = 0,  C  = 1.

2.  The diﬀerential equation governing the concentration of substrate in the 
microreactor  is  given  by  Equation(2).  The  term  on  the  left  hand  side 
of  the  equation  is  the  convective  term  and  the  term  on  the  right  hand 
side  is the diﬀusive term.  The reaction term  in not present because the 
reaction  is  instantaneous on the boundary and  in  incorporated  into the 
boundary  conditions.

U0	 = 7.5  cm/s.  At  the  centerline  we  apply  the  symmetry  condition, 
∂C 
which  tells  us  that  ∂ y  =  0.  The  discretized  analog  of  this  equation  is 
given  in  Equation(6).  The  boundary  conditions  at  x  =  0  is  that  all 
the  dimensionless  variable  C  =  1  (see  Equation(7))  and  at  x  = 5  cm 
∂C  =	 0  (see  Equation(8)).  Also  according  to  the  problem  statement

4.  This  is a constrained minimization problem and hence the minimum of 
the problem will in general not lie at a point where  ∂ yield  = 0,  ∂ yield  = 0 
∂x 
∂ y 
and  ∂ yield  = 0.  Instead  the  gradient  yield  will  be  normal  to  one  of  the 
∂ z 
inequality  constraints  if  the  constraint  is  active.  Thus  there  wont  be 
any  decrease  in  the  yield  if  we  have  to  satisfy  the  constraints.  Only  in 
the  scenario  that  none  of  the  inequlity  constraints  are  active  will  the 
partial  derivative  of  yield  be  0. 

5.  If  the  reaction  is  not  instantaneous  then  instead  of  having  a  diriclet 
boundary condition at  the wall we will have a neumann boundary con­
dition,  the  ﬂux  towards  the  wall  will  be  equal  to  the  rate  of  reaction 
on  the  surface  of  the  wall.  The  boundary  condition  is  expressed  in 
Equation(11).
