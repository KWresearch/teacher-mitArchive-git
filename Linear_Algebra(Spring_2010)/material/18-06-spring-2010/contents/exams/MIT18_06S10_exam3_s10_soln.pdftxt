1.  (40  points)  Suppose  u  is  a  unit  vector  in  Rn ,  so  uT u  = 1.  This  problem  is  about  the  n  by  n 
symmetric matrix  H  = I − 2u u T . 

(a)	 Show  directly  that  H 2  = I .  Since  H  = H T ,  we  now  know  that  H  is  not  only 

symmetric  but  also	
. 
Solution  Explicitly,  we  ﬁnd  H 2  = (I − 2uuT )2  =  I 2  − 4uuT  + 4uuuT uuT  (2  points): 

since  uT u =  1,  H 2  =  I  (3  points).  Since  H  = H T ,  we  also  have  H T H  =  1,  implying 

that H  is  an  orthogonal  (or  unitary) matrix. 

(b)	 One  eigenvector  of  H  is  u  itself.  Find  the  corresponding  eigenvalue.

Solution
 Since H u = (I − 2uuT )u = u − 2uuT u = u − 2u = −u,  λ = −1. 

(c)	 If  v  is  any  vector  perpendicular  to  u,  show  that  v  is  an  eigenvector  of  H  and  ﬁnd  the 

eigenvalue.  With  all  these  eigenvectors  v ,  that  eigenvalue  must  be  repeated  how  many 

times?  Is H  diagonalizable?  Why  or  why  not? 
Solution  For any vector v orthogonal to u (i.e.  uT v = 0), we have H v = (I −2uuT )v = 
v − 2uuT v  =  v ,  so  the  associated  λ  is  1.  The  orthogonal  complement  to  the  space 
spanned by u has dimension n−1, so there is a basis of (n−1) orthonormal eigenvectors 

with  this  eigenvalue.  Adding  in  the  eigenvector  u,  we  ﬁnd  that H  is  diagonalizable. 

(d)	 Find  the  diagonal  entries  H11  and  Hii  in  terms  of  u1 , . . . , un .  Add  up  H11  + . . . + Hnn  and 

separately  add  up  the  eigenvalues  of  H.

2.  (30  points)  Suppose  A  is  a  positive  deﬁnite  symmetric  n  by  n  matrix. 

(a)  How  do  you  know  that  A−1  is  also  positive  deﬁnite?  (We  know  A−1  is  symmetric.  I  just 

had  an  e-mail  from  the  International Monetary  Fund  with  this  question.) 

Solution  Since a matrix is positive-deﬁnite if and only if all its eigenvalues are positive 
(5  points),  and  since  the  eigenvalues  of A−1  are  simply  the  inverses  of  the  eigenvalues 
of  A,  A−1  is  also  positive  deﬁnite  (the  inverse  of  a  positive  number  is  positive)  (5 

points). 

(b)  Suppose  Q  is  any  orthogonal  n  by  n  matrix.  How  do  you  know  that  Q A QT  = Q A Q−1 

is  positive  deﬁnite?  Write  down  which  test  you  are  using. 

Solution  Using  the  energy  text  (xT Ax > 0  for nonzero x), we ﬁnd  that xT QAQT x = 

(QT x)T A(QT x) > 0 for all nonzero x as well (since Q is invertible).  Using the positive 
eigenvalue  test,  since  A  is  similar  to  QAQ−1  and  similar  matrices  have  the  same 
eigenvalues,  QAQ−1  also  has  all  positive  eigenvalues.  (5  points  for  test,  5  points  for 

application) 

(c)  Show  that  the  block matrix

A A 
is  positive  semideﬁnite.  How  do  you  know  B  is  not  positive  deﬁnite? 

A A


B =


Solution  First,  since  B  is  singular,  it  cannot  be  positive  deﬁnite  (it  has  eigenvalues 

of  0).  However,  the  pivots  of  B  are  the  pivots  of  A  in  the  ﬁrst  n  rows  followed  by  0s 

in  the  remaining  rows,  so by  the pivot  test, B  is  still  semi-deﬁnite.  Similarly,  the ﬁrst 

n  upper-left  determinants  of  B  are  the  same  as  those  of  A,  while  the  remaining  ones

are  0s,  giving  another  proof.  Finally,  given  a  nonzero  vector

associated  eigenvectors  are  [1  − 2i]T , [1  2i]T ,  though  there  are many  other  choices

(4  points).  u(0)  is  just  the  sum  of  these  two  vectors  (2  points).

–First,  compute  V  and  Σ  using  the matrix  AT A.


–Second,  ﬁnd  the  (orthonormal)  columns  of  U.
