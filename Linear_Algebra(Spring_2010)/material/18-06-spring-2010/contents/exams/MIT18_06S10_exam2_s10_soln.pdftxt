(a)  Find  the  matrix  P  that  pro jects  every  vector  b  in  R3  onto  the  line  in  the  direction  of 

a = (2, 1, 3). 

Solution
 The  general  formula  for  the  orthogonal  pro jection  onto  the  column  space  of  a


matrix A  is 

Here,


P  = A(AT A)−1AT .

Remarks: 
•  Since  we’re  pro jecting  onto  a  one-dimensional  space,  AT A  is  just  a  number  and  we 
can  write  things  like  P  = (AAT )/(AT A).  This  won’t  work  in  general. 
•  You  don’t  have  to  know  the  formula  to  do  this.  The  ith  column  of P  is,  pretty much 
by  deﬁnition,  the  pro jection  of  ei  (e1  = (1, 0, 0),  e2  = (0, 1, 0),  e3  = (0, 0, 1))  onto  the 

line  in  the  direction  of  a.  And  this  is  something  you  should  know  how  to  do without 

a  formula. 

RUBRIC: There was  some  leniency  for  computational  errors,  but  otherwise  there weren’t 

many  opportunities  for  partial  credit.

ular  to  a  and  not  in  the  same  line  will  work). 

RUBRIC: 6 points for giving a correct basis, and 4 points for giving the complete geometric 

description.  Note that it is not correct to say e.g., N (P) = R2 .  It is correct to say that N (P) 

is  a  (2-dimensional) plane  in R3 ,  but  this  is not  a  complete  geometric description unless you 

say  (geometrically)  which  plane  it  is:  the  one  perpendicular  to  a/to  the  line  through  a. 

(c)  What  are  al l  the  eigenvectors  of  P  and  their  corresponding  eigenvalues?  (You  can  use 

the  geometry  of  pro jections,  not  a messy  calculation.)  The  diagonal  entries  of P  add  up 

to 

. 

Solution  The  diagonal  entries  of  P  add  up  to  1  =  the  sum  of  the  eigenvalues 

Since P  is a pro jection,  it’s only possible  eigenvalues are λ = 0  (with multiplicity  equal  to 

the  dimension  of  the  nullspace,  here  2)  and  λ = 1  (with multiplicity  equal  to  the  dimension 
of  the  column  space,  here  1).  So,  a  complete  list  of  eigenvectors  and  eigenvalues  is: 
�T 
�
�T 
�
•	
λ = 0 with multiplicity  2.  The  eigenvectors  for λ = 0  are  precisely  the  vectors  in  the 
null  space.  That  is,  all  linear  combinations  of  3  0  −2 
and  −1 2 0 
. 
�T 
�
λ = 1 with multiplicity  1.  The  eigenvectors  for λ = 1  are  precisely  the  vectors  in  the 
column  space.  That  is,  all multiples  of  2  1  3 
.

RUBRIC:  2  points  for  the  sum  of  eigenvalues,  4  points  for  a  full  list  (with  multiplicities) 

of  eigenvalues,  and  4  points  for  a  complete  description  of  all  eigenvectors.  In  light  of  the 

emphasized  “al l,”  you’d  lose  1  point  if  you  gave  two  eigenvectors  for  λ  =  0  and  didn’t  say 

that  all  (at  least  non-zero)  linear  combinations  were  also  eigenvectors  for  λ = 0. 

(a)	 p = Ax� is  the  vector  in C (A)  nearest  to  a  given  vector  b.  If A  has  independent  columns, 
2.	 (34  points) 
what  equation  determines  x� ?  What  are  all  the  vectors  perpendicular  to  the  error 
e = b − Ax� ?  What  goes  wrong  if  the  columns  of  A  are  dependent? 
Solution  x� is  determined  by  the  equation  x� = (AT A)−1AT b  (since  A  has  independent 
columns,  AT A  is  invertible  whether  or  not  A  is  square).  The  vectors  perpendicular  to  an 

arbitrary  error  vector  are  the  elements  of  the  column  space  of  A.  If  the  columns  of  A  are 

dependent, AT A  is  no  longer  invertible,  and  there  is  no  unique  nearest  vector  (i.e.  there  are 

multiple  solutions). 

RUBRIC:  4  points  for  the  determining  equation  (1  point  oﬀ  for  actually  inverting  AT A 

or  saying  that  it was  invertible),  3  points  for  identifying  the  column  space,  and  three  points 

for  identifying  the multiple  solutions  (1  point  oﬀ  if  you  just  say  that AT A  is  not  invertible). 
Note  that  you  cannot write A−1B  as  A :  this  only works  for  numbers  because multiplication 
B
and  division  are  commutative,  which  is  not  true  for matrices. 
Find  x� and  p  in  terms  of Q  and  R  and  b  (not  A). 
(b)  Suppose A = QR where Q has orthonormal columns and R is upper triangular invertible. 
Solution  Since QT Q = I  and  R  is  invertible,  we  obtain

x� = (AT A)−1AT b = ((QR)T (QR))−1 (QR)T b

= (RT QT QR)−1RT QT b = R−1 (RT )−1RT QT b = R−1QT b 
p = (QR)x� = QQT b 
Note  that QQT  is  not  the  identity matrix  in  general. 
RUBIC: 6 points  for ﬁnding x�,  4 points  for p.  One point oﬀ  from  each  if  the equations are 
not  simpliﬁed, more  points  oﬀ  for  bad  form,  having  variables  other  than Q, R  and  b,  etc. 

(c)  If q1  and q2  are any orthonormal vectors  in R5 , give a  formula  for  the pro jection p of any 

vector  b  onto  the  plane  spanned  by  q1  and  q2  (write  p  as  a  combination  of  q1  and  q2 ).

RUBRIC:  little partial credit.  If you  identiﬁed the diﬀerence between b and p  instead, you 

may  have  gotten  some  points. 

3.	 (33  points)  This  problem  is  about  the  n  by  n  matrix  An  that  has  zeros  on  its  main 
diagonal  and  all  other  entries  equal  to −1.  In MATLAB  An  = eye (n) − ones (n). 
(a)  Find  the  determinant  of  An .  Here  is  a  suggested  approach:

Start  by  adding  all  rows  (except  the  last)  to  the  last  row,  and  then  factoring  out  a 
constant.  (You  could  check  n = 3  to  have  a  start  on  part  b.) 
Solution  Following  the  hint,  add  all  of  the  rows  to  the  last  row  (which  does  not  change  the 
⎡ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣

determinant).  Thus  the matrix  becomes

Next,  pull  out  the  factor  of  −(n − 1)  from  the  last  row.  As  the  determinant  is  linear  in

This  matrix  is  lower  triangular.  So  its  determinant  is  the  product  of  the  entries  on  its 
diagonal.  Thus  the  above  quantity  is  (1 − n).

Alternately,  one  can  ﬁnd  the  determinant  of  the  matrix  by  ﬁnding  all  its  eigenvalues. 
As  An  =  I  − ones(n),  we  know  that  N (An  −  I ) =  N (− ones(n)).  The  latter  nullspace 
has  dimension  n − 1.  Thus  1  is  an  eigenvalue  of  multiplicity  n − 1,  and  the  corresponding 
eigenvectors  are  all  the  nonzero  vectors  whose  entries  add  up  to  0. 
In addition, all of the rows of An  add up to 1− n.  So 1− n is an eigenvalue with eigenvector 
(1, 1, . . . , 1).  Thus  we  have  found  all  of  the  eigenvectors  and  eigenvalues.  The  determinant 
is  the  product  of  the  eigenvalues,  so  it  is  1n−1  (1 − n)  or  1 − n.

RUBRIC:  2  points  for  following  the  hint,  2  points  for  pulling  out  the  factor  of  (1 − n) 
correctly,  2  points  for  adding  the  last  row  to  the  other  rows,  2  points  for  the  correct  answer. 
(b)  For  any  invertible matrix  A,  the  (1, 1)  entry  of  A−1  is  the  ratio  of 
So  the  (1, 1)  entry  of  A−
1  is

. 

Solution  Cramer’s rule gives A−1  =  1  C T  where C  is the cofactor matrix, whose (i, j ) entry 
|A| 
is  (−1)i+j |Mij |  where Mij  is  the  submatrix  obtained  by  deleting  row  i  and  column  j  of  the 
(arbitrary)  invertible matrix  A.  Thus  the  entry  with  i = j  = 1  is  |M11 |/|A|. 
In the case where A = An , the submatrix M11  is An−1 ; so the desired formula is |An−1 |/|An |. 
Now,  |An | = 1 − n  by  part  (a).  So  |A4 | = −3  and  |A3 | = −2.  Thus  the  (1, 1)  entry  of  A−1 
4 
is  2/3. 

RUBRIC:  5 points for the correct ratio, 5 points for the correct application to the current 

problem.  If  the  wrong  ratio  was  given,  then  no  credit  was  given  for  applying  it. 

(c)  Find  two  orthogonal  eigenvectors  with  A3 x = x.  (So  λ = 1  is  a  double  eigenvalue.) 

Solution  In  solution  2  of  part  (a)  above,  we  saw  that  the  eigenvectors  are  all  the  nonzero 
vectors  whose  entries  add  up  to  0.  Two  obvious  such  vectors  are  (1, −1, 0)  and  (0, 1, −1), 
but  there  are many more  linearly  independent  pairs. 
However,  (1, −1, 0)  and  (0, 1, −1)  are  not  orthogonal!  So  we  must  ﬁnd  another  pair.  We 
can use the Gram–Schmidt process to get orthogonal vectors, or we can just try to guess two 
orthogonal  vectors  whose  entries  add  up  to  1.  For  example,  (1, −1, 0)  and  (1, 1, −2)  work. 
(Note  that  the  vectors  are  not  required  to  have  unit  length.) 

RUBRIC:  up  to  5  points  for  a  correct  method,  2  points  for  ﬁnding  linearly  independent 

vectors,  3  points  for  orthogonality. 

(d)  What  is  the  third  eigenvalue  of  A3  and  a  corresponding  eigenvector? 

Solution  In  solution  2  of  part  (a)  above,  we  saw  that  the  third  eigenvalue  is  −2  and  a 
corresponding  eigenvector  is  (1, 1, 1). 

Another  way  to  proceed  is  to  notice  that  the  trace  of  A3  is  0.  However,  the  trace  is  the 
sum  of  the  eigenvalues,  and  two  of  them  are  1.  So  the  third  must  be  −2.  Alternatively,  in 
part (a), we saw that |A3 | = −2.  However, the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues, 
and  two  of  them  are  1.  So  the  third must  be −2. 
A third way to proceed  is to ﬁnd the characteristic polynomial of A3 , which  is λ3 − 3λ + 2. 
Since  1  is  a  double  root,  we  can  ﬁnd  the  third  root  by  dividing  twice  by  λ − 1. 

RUBRIC:  5  points  for  the  eigenvalue,  5  points  for  a  corresponding  eigenvector.
