1.  (30  points) 

(a)  Find  the  matrix  P  that  pro jects  every  vector  b  in  R3  onto  the  line  in  the  direction  of 

a = (2, 1, 3). 

(b)  What  are  the  column  space  and  nullspace  of  P  ?  Describe  them  geometrically  and  also 

give  a  basis  for  each  space. 

(c)  What  are  al l  the  eigenvectors  of  P  and  their  corresponding  eigenvalues?  (You  can  use 

the  geometry  of  pro jections,  not  a messy  calculation.)  The  diagonal  entries  of P  add  up 

to

(a)	 p = Ax� is  the  vector  in C (A)  nearest  to  a  given  vector  b.  If A  has  independent  columns, 
2.	 (30  points) 
what  equation  determines  x� ?  What  are  all  the  vectors  perpendicular  to  the  error 
e = b − Ax� ?  What  goes  wrong  if  the  columns  of  A  are  dependent? 

Find  x� and  p  in  terms  of Q  and  R  and  b  (not  A). 
(b)  Suppose A = QR where Q has orthonormal columns and R is upper triangular invertible. 

(c)  (Separate question) If q1  and q2  are any orthonormal vectors in R5 , give a formula for the 

pro jection p of any vector b onto the plane spanned by q1  and q2  (write p as a combination 

of  q1  and  q2 ). 

3.	 (40  points)  This  problem  is  about  the  n  by  n  matrix  An  that  has  zeros  on  its  main 
diagonal  and  all  other  entries  equal  to −1.  In MATLAB  An  = eye (n) − ones (n). 

(a)  Find  the  determinant  of  An .  Here  is  a  suggested  approach: 

Start  by  adding  all  rows  (except  the  last)  to  the  last  row,  and  then  factoring  out  a 

constant.  (You  could  check  n = 3  to  have  a  start  on  part  b.) 

(b)  For  any  invertible matrix  A,  the  (1, 1)  entry  of  A−1  is  the  ratio  of 
So  the  (1, 1)  entry  of  A−
1  is

. 

(c)  Find  two  orthogonal  eigenvectors  with  A3 x = x.  (So  λ = 1  is  a  double  eigenvalue.) 

(d)  What  is  the  third  eigenvalue  of  A3  and  a  corresponding  eigenvector?
