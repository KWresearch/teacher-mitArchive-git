1.  (40  points)  Suppose  u  is  a  unit  vector  in  Rn ,  so  uT u  = 1.  This  problem  is  about  the  n  by  n 
symmetric matrix  H  = I − 2u u T . 

(a)	 Show  directly  that  H 2  = I .  Since  H  = H T ,  we  now  know  that  H  is  not  only 

symmetric  but  also	

. 

(b)	 One  eigenvector  of  H  is  u  itself.  Find  the  corresponding  eigenvalue. 

(c)	 If  v  is  any  vector  perpendicular  to  u,  show  that  v  is  an  eigenvector  of  H  and  ﬁnd  the 

eigenvalue.  With  all  these  eigenvectors  v ,  that  eigenvalue  must  be  repeated  how  many 

times?  Is H  diagonalizable?  Why  or  why  not? 

(d)	 Find  the  diagonal  entries  H11  and  Hii  in  terms  of  u1 , . . . , un .  Add  up  H11  + . . . + Hnn  and 

separately  add  up  the  eigenvalues  of  H.

2.  (30  points)  Suppose  A  is  a  positive  deﬁnite  symmetric  n  by  n  matrix. 

(a)  How  do  you  know  that  A−1  is  also  positive  deﬁnite?  (We  know  A−1  is  symmetric.  I  just 

had  an  e-mail  from  the  International Monetary  Fund  with  this  question.) 

(b)  Suppose  Q  is  any  orthogonal  n  by  n  matrix.  How  do  you  know  that  Q A QT  = Q A Q−1 

is  positive  deﬁnite?  Write  down  which  test  you  are  using. 

(c)  Show  that  the  block matrix


B =

A A

is  positive  semideﬁnite.  How  do  you  know  B  is  not  positive  deﬁnite?

(b)  Solve  the  equation 

du

In  other  words:  the  solution  u(t)  is  what  combination  of  the  eigenvectors  of  A? 

= Au  starting  with  the  same  vector  u(0)  at  time  t = 0. 

(c)  Find  the  3 matrices  in  the  Singular  Value  Decomposition  A = U Σ V T  in  two  steps. 

–First,  compute  V  and  Σ  using  the matrix  AT A.


–Second,  ﬁnd  the  (orthonormal)  columns  of  U.
