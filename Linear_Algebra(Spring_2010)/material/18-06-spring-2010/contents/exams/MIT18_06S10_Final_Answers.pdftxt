(c)  What  values  should  y  have  at  times  t = 0, 1, 2  so  that  the  best  curve  is  y = 0?

The  pro jection  is  p = (0, 0, 0)  if AT b = 0.  In  this  case,  b =  values  of  y = c(2, −3, 1).

The  initial  vector  (x(0), y (0)) = (1, 0)  is  x1  − x2 .

So  the  solution  is  (x(t), y (t)) = et (2, 1) + e−t (1, 1).

(b) 	 Find  the  matrix  A  that  produces  this  rotation  (so  Av  is  the  rotation  of  v).  Explain  why 
A3  = I . What  are  the  eigenvalues  of  A? 

Answer: 

A3  = I  because  this  is  three  120�  rotations  (so  360� ).  The  eigenvalues  satisfy  �3  = 1 
so  � = 1, e2�i/3 , e−2�i/3  = e4�i/3 .

and  three  independent  eigenvectors  of  P .  No  need  to  compute  P . 

Answer:  The  plane  is  perpendicular  to  the  vector  (1, 2, 1).  This  is  an  eigenvector  of 
P  with  � = 0.  The  vectors  (−2, 1, 0)  and  (1, −1, 1)  are  eigenvectors  with  � = 0.

(c)  If  A  is  any  m  by  n  matrix  with  m  >  n,  tell  me  why  AAT  cannot  be  positive  deﬁnite.  Is  AT A 
always  positive  deﬁnite?  (If  not,  what  is  the  test  on  A?) 

Answer 

AAT  is m  by  m  but  its  rank  is  not  greater  than  n  (all  columns  of  AAT  are  combinations  of

columns  of A).  Since  n < m,  AAT  is  singular.

AT A  is  positive  deﬁnite  if  A  has  full  colum  rank  n.  (Not  always  true,  A  can  even  be  a  zero

matrix.)

(a)  Find  det A  and  give  a  reason. 

Answer: 
det A = 0  because  two  rows  are  equal. 

(b)  Find  the  cofactor  C11  and  then  ﬁnd  det B .  This  is  the  volume  of  what  region  in  R 4? 

Answer: 
The  cofactor  C11  = −1.  Then  det B  =  det A − C11  = 1.  This  is  the  volume  of  a  box 
in R4  with  edges  =  rows  of B . 

(c)  Find  det C  for  any  value  of  x.  You  could  use  linearity  in  row  1. 

Answer: 
det C  = xC11  + det B  = −x + 1.  Check  this  answer  (zero),  for  x = 1  when  C  = A.

(a)	 When  A  is  similar  to  B  = M −1AM ,  prove  this  statement:

If Ak  � 0  when  k � �,  then  also  B k  � 0.

Answer: 
A  and  B  have  the  same  eigenvalues.  If  Ak  � 0  then  all  |�| < 1.  Therefore  B k  � 0.

S−1AS  is  diagonal.  Show  that  these matrices  A  form  a  subspace  of


3  by  3 matrix  space.  (Test  the  requirements  for  a  subspace.)


Answer: 
If  A1  and  A2  are  in  the  space,  they  are  diagonalized  by  S.  Then  S −1 (cA1  + dA2 )S  is 
diagonal +  diagonal =  diagonal.

(c)	 Suppose v1  = 1 and v4  = 0. If each edge contains a unit resistor, the currents (w 1 , w2 , w3 , w4 , w5 , w6 ) 
on  the  6  edges  will  be  w = −Av  by  Ohm’s  Law.  Then  Kirchhoﬀ ’s  Current  Law  (ﬂow  in  = 
ﬂow  out  at  every  node)  gives  AT w  =  0  which  means  AT Av  = 0.  Solve  AT Av  =  0  for  the 

unknown  voltages  v2  and  v3 .  Find  all  6  currents  w1  to  w6 .  How  much  current  enters  node 
4? 

Answer: 

Note:  As  stated  there  is  no  solution  (my  apologies!).  All  solutions  to  AT Av  =  0  are

multiples  of  (1, 1, 1, 1) which  rules  out  v1  = 1  and  v4  = 0.

Intended  problem:  I  meant  to  solve  the  reduced  equations  using KC L  only  at  nodes

2  and  3.  In  fact  symmetry  gives  v2  = v3  =  1
2 .  Then  the  currents  are  w1  = w2  = w5  =

1  around  the  sides  and w3  = 1  and w4  = 0  (symmetry).  So w3 + w5 + w6  =  2
1  is 
w6  =  2
the  total  current  into  node  4.
