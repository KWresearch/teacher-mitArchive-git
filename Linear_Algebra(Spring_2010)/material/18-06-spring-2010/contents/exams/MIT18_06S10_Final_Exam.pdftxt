2.  (11  points)  This  problem  ﬁnds  the  curve  y  = C + D 2 t  which  gives  the  best  least  squares  ﬁt 
to  the  points  (t, y) = (0, 6), (1, 4), (2, 0). 

(a)  Write  down  the  3  equations  that  would  be  satisﬁed  if  the  curve  went  through  all  3  points.


(b)  Find  the  coeﬃcients  C  and D  of  the  best  curve  y = C + D2 t . 

(c)  What  values  should  y  have  at  times  t = 0, 1, 2  so  that  the  best  curve  is  y = 0? 

3.  (11  points)  Suppose Avi  = bi  for  the  vectors  v1 , . . . , vn  and  b1 , . . . , bn  in  Rn .  Put  the  v ’s  into 
the  columns  of  V  and  put  the  b’s  into  the  columns  of  B . 

(a)	 Write  those  equations  Avi  =  bi  in  matrix  form.  What  condition  on  which  vectors  allows  A 
to  be  determined  uniquely?  Assuming  this  condition,  ﬁnd  A  from  V  and  B . 

(b) 	 Describe  the  column  space  of  that  matrix  A  in  terms  of  the  given  vectors. 

(c)	 What  additional  condition  on  which  vectors  makes  A  an  invertible  matrix?  Assuming  this, 
ﬁnd A−1  from  V  and B . 

4.  (11  points) 

(a)	 Suppose  xk  is  the  fraction  of  MIT  students  who  prefer  calculus  to  linear  algebra  at  year  k . 
The  remaining  fraction  yk  = 1 − xk  prefers  linear  algebra. 

At  year  k + 1,  1/5  of  those  who  prefer  calculus  change  their  mind  (possibly  after  taking 
18.03).  Also  at  year  k  + 1,  1/10  of  those  who  prefer  linear  algebra  change  their  mind 
(possibly  because  of  this  exam).

(a)	 Consider  a  120�  rotation  around  the  axis  x  =  y  =  z .  Show  that  the  vector  i  =  (1, 0, 0)  is 
rotated  to  the  vector  j  = (0, 1, 0).  (Similarly  j  is  rotated  to  k = (0, 0, 1)  and  k  is  rotated  to 

i.)  How  is  j − i  related  to  the  vector  (1, 1, 1)  along  the  axis? 

(b) 	 Find  the  matrix  A  that  produces  this  rotation  (so  Av  is  the  rotation  of  v).  Explain  why 
A3  = I . What  are  the  eigenvalues  of  A? 

(c)	 If a 3 by 3 matrix P  pro jects every vector onto the plane x+ 2y + z = 0, ﬁnd three eigenvalues 
and  three  independent  eigenvectors  of  P .  No  need  to  compute  P .

(a)	 Find  the  eigenvalues  of  AT A  and  also  of  AAT .  For  both  matrices  ﬁnd  a  complete  set  of 
orthonormal  eigenvectors. 

(b) 	 If  you  apply  the  Gram-Schmidt  process  (orthonormalization)  to  the  columns  of  this matrix 
A,  what  is  the  resulting  output? 

(c)	 If  A  is  any  m  by  n  matrix  with  m  >  n,  tell  me  why  AAT  cannot  be  positive  deﬁnite.  Is 
AT A  always  positive  deﬁnite?  (If  not,  what  is  the  test  on  A?)

(a)  Find  det A  and  give  a  reason. 

(b)  Find  the  cofactor  C11  and  then  ﬁnd  det B .  This  is  the  volume  of  what  region  in  R 4? 

(c)  Find  det C  for  any  value  of  x.  You  could  use  linearity  in  row  1. 

8.  (11  points) 

(a)	 When  A  is  similar  to  B  = M −1AM ,  prove  this  statement:

If Ak  � 0  when  k � �,  then  also  B k  � 0.


(b) 	 Suppose S  is  a  ﬁxed  invertible  3  by  3  matrix.

This  question  is  about  all  the matrices  A  that  are  diagonalized  by  S ,  so  that


S−1AS  is  diagonal.  Show  that  these matrices  A  form  a  subspace  of


3  by  3 matrix  space.  (Test  the  requirements  for  a  subspace.)


(c)	 Give  a  basis  for  the  space  of  3 by  3 diagonal  matrices.  Find a  basis  for  the  space  in  part  (b) 
—  all  the  matrices  A  that  are  diagonalized  by  S . 

9.	 (11  points)  This  square  network  has  4  nodes  and  6  edges.  On  each  edge,  the  direction  of 
positive  current wi  > 0  is  from  lower  node  number  to  higher  node  number.  The  voltages  at  the 
nodes  are  (v1 , v2 , v3 , v4 .) 

(a)	 Write down the incidence matrix A for this network (so that Av gives the 6 voltage diﬀerences 
like v2−v1  across the 6 edges).  What is the rank of A?  What is the dimension of the nullspace 
of  AT ? 

(b)	 Compute  the  matrix  AT A. What  is  its  rank?  What  is  its  nullspace? 

(c)	 Suppose v1  = 1 and v4  = 0. If each edge contains a unit resistor, the currents (w 1 , w2 , w3 , w4 , w5 , w6 ) 
on  the  6  edges  will  be  w = −Av  by  Ohm’s  Law.  Then  Kirchhoﬀ ’s  Current  Law  (ﬂow  in  = 
ﬂow  out  at  every  node)  gives  AT w  =  0  which  means  AT Av  = 0.  Solve  AT Av  =  0  for  the 
unknown  voltages  v2  and  v3 .  Find  all  6  currents  w1  to  w6 .  How  much  current  enters  node 
4?
