(a)	 (14  points) What  is  the  3  by  3  reduced  row  echelon matrix  R  and  what  is  d? 
Solution:  First,  since  R  is  in  reduced  row  echelon  form,  we must  have

d =  4 0 0 
The  other  two  vectors  provide  special  solutions  for  R,  showing  that  R  has  rank  1:

then  5  times  row  1  from  row  3,  what matrix  connects  R  and  d  to  the  original  A  and 
b?  Use  this matrix  to  ﬁnd  A  and  b.

3.  (16  points)  Circle  the  words  that  correctly  complete  the  following  sentence: 

(a)  Suppose  a  3  by  5 matrix  A  has  rank  r = 3.  Then  the  equation  Ax = b 

(  always  /  sometimes  but  not  always  ) 

has  (  a  unique  solution  / many  solutions  /  no  solution  ). 

Solution:  the  equation  Ax = b
 always
 has
 many  solutions  .


(b)  What  is  the  column  space  of  A?  Describe  the  nullspace  of  A.


Solution:
 The  column  space  is  a  3-dimensional  space  inside  a  3-dimensional  space  , i.e.

it  contains  all  the  vectors,  and
 the  nullspace  has  dimension  5 − 3 = 2 > 0  inside  R5 .

(a)	 (10  points)  Explain  in words  how  knowing  all  solutions  to Ax = b  decides  if  a  given

.


vector  b  is  in  the  column  space  of  A. 

Solution:  The  column  space  of  A  contains  all  linear  combinations  of  the  columns  of 
A,  which  are  precisely  vectors  of  the  form  Ax  for  an  arbitrary  vector  x.  Thus, 
⎤

Ax = b  has  a  solution  if  and  only  if  b  is  in  the  column  space  of  A  .
