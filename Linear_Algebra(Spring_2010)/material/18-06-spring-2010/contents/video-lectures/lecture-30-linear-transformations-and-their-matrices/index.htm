<p></p> <p>OK, this is the lecture on linear transformations. Actually, linear  algebra courses used to begin with this lecture, so you could say I'm  beginning this course again by talking about linear transformations.</p> <p>In  a lot of courses, those come first before matrices. The idea of a  linear transformation makes sense without a matrix, and physicists and  other -- some people like it better that way. They don't like  coordinates.</p> <p>They don't want those numbers. They want to see  what's going on with the whole space. But, for most of us, in the end,  if we're going to compute anything, we introduce coordinates, and then  every linear transformation will lead us to a matrix.</p> <p>And then,  to all the things that we've done about null space and row space, and  determinant, and eigenvalues -- all will come from the matrix.</p> <p>But,  behind it -- in other words, behind this is the idea of a linear  transformation. Let me give an example of a linear transformation. So,  example.</p> <p>Example one. A projection. I can describe a projection  without telling you any matrix, anything about any matrix. I can  describe a projection, say, this will be a linear transformation that  takes, say, all of R^2, every vector in the plane, into a vector in the  plane. And this is the way people describe, a mapping. It takes every  vector, and so, by what rule? So, what's the rule, is, I take a -- so  here's the plane, this is going to be my line, my line through my line,  and I'm going to project every vector onto that line. So if I take a  vector like b -- or let me call the vector v for the moment -- the  projection -- the linear transformation is going to produce this vector  as T(v). So T -- it's like a function.</p> <p>Exactly like a function. You give me an input, the transformation produces the output.</p> <p>So  transformation, sometimes the word map, or mapping is used. A map  between inputs and outputs. So this is one particular map, this is one  example, a projection that takes every vector -- here, let me do another  vector v, or let me do this vector w, what is T(w)? You see? There are  no coordinates here.</p> <p>I've drawn those axes, but I'm sorry I drew  them, I'm going to remove them, that's the whole point, is that we don't  need axes, we just need -- so guts -- get it out of there, I'm not a  physicist, so I draw those axes. So the input is w, the output of the  projection is, project on that line, T(w). OK.</p> <p>Now, I could think of a lot of transformations T.</p> <p>But,  in this linear algebra course, I want it to be a linear transformation.  So here are the rules for a linear transformation. Here, see, exactly,  the two operations that we can do on vectors, adding and multiplying by  scalars, the transformation does something special with respect to those  operations.</p> <p>So, for example, the projection is a linear  transformation because -- for example, if I wanted to check that one, if  I took v to be twice as long, the projection would be twice as long.</p> <p>If I took v to be minus -- if I changed from v to minus v, the projection would change to a minus.</p> <p>So  c equal to two, c equal minus one, any c is OK. So you see that  actually, those combine, I can combine those into one statement. What  the transformation does to any linear combination, it must produce the  same combination of T(v) and T(w). Let's think about some -- I mean,  it's like, not hard to decide, is a transformation linear or is it not.</p> <p>Let me give you an example so you can tell me the answer. Suppose my transformation is -- here's another example two.</p> <p>Shift  the whole plane. So here are all my vectors, my plane, and every vector  v in the plane, I shift it over by, let's say, three by some vector v0.</p> <p>Shift whole plane by v0. So every vector in the plane -- this was v, T(v) will be v+v0. There's T(v).</p> <p>Here's v0. There's the typical v.</p> <p>And there's T(v). You see what this transformation does? Takes this vector and adds to it. Adds a fixed vector to it.</p> <p>Well, that seems like a pretty reasonable, simple transformation, but is it linear? The answer is no, it's not linear.</p> <p>Which law is broken? Maybe both laws are broken.</p> <p>Let's see. If I double the length of v, does the transformation produce something double -- do I double T(v)? No.</p> <p>If  I double the length of v, in this transformation, I'm just adding on  the same one -- same v0, not two v0s, but only one v0 for every vector,  so I don't get two times the transform. Do you see what I'm saying? That  if I double this, then the transformation starts there and only goes  one v0 out and doesn't double T(v). In fact, a linear transformation --  what is T of zero? That's just like a special case, but really worth  noticing. The zero vector in a linear transformation must get  transformed to zero.</p> <p>It can't move, because, take any vector V  here -- well, so you can see why T of zero is zero. Take v to be the  zero vector, take c to be three. Then we'd have T of zero vector  equaling three T of zero vector, the T of zero has to be zero.</p> <p>OK.  So, this example is really a non-example. Shifting the whole plane is  not a linear transformation. Or if I cooked up some formula that  involved squaring, or the transformation that, also non-example, how  about the transformation that, takes any vector and produces its length?  So there's a transformation that takes any vector, say, any vector in  R^3, let me just -- I'll just get a chance to use this notation again.</p> <p>Suppose I think of the transformation that takes any vector in R^3 and produces this number.</p> <p>So that, I could say, is a member of R^1, for example, if I wanted.</p> <p>Or just real numbers. That's certainly not linear.</p> <p>It's true that the zero vector goes to zero.</p> <p>But  if I double a vector, it does double the length, that's true. But  suppose I multiply a vector by minus two. What happens to its length? It  just doubles. It doesn't get multiplied by minus two. So when c is  minus two in my requirement, I'm not satisfying that requirement.</p> <p>So  T of minus v is not minus v -- minus, the length, it's just the length.  OK, so that's another non-example. Projection was an example, let me  give you another example.</p> <p>I can stay here and have a -- this will be an example that is a linear transformation, a rotation.</p> <p>Rotation  by -- what shall we say? By 45 degrees. OK? So again, let me choose  this, this will be a mapping, from the whole plane of vectors, into the  whole plane of vectors, and it just -- here is the input vector v, and  the output vector foam this 45 degree rotation is just rotate that thing  by 45 degrees, T(v).</p> <p>So every vector got rotated. You see that I can describe this without any coordinates. And see that it's linear.</p> <p>If  I doubled v, the rotation would just be twice as far out. If I had v+w,  and if I rotated each of them and added, the answer's the same as if I  add and then rotate. That's what the linear transformation is. OK, so  those are two examples.</p> <p>Two examples, projection and rotation,  and I could invent more that are linear transformations where I haven't  told you a matrix yet. Actually, the book has a picture of the action of  linear transformations -- actually, the cover of the book has it. So,  in this section seven point one, we can think of a -- actually, here  let's take this linear transformation, rotation, suppose I have, as the  cover of the book has, a house in R^2.</p> <p>So instead of this, let me  take a small house in R^2. So that's a whole lot of points. The idea  is, with this linear transformation, that I can see what it does to  everything at once.</p> <p>I don't have to just take one vector at a  time and see what T of V is, I can take all the vectors on the outline  of the house, and see where they all go.</p> <p>In fact, that will show me where the whole house goes.</p> <p>So  what will happen with this particular linear transformation? The whole  house will rotate, so the result, if I can draw it, will be, the house  will be sitting there.</p> <p>OK. And, but suppose I give some other  examples. Oh, let me give some examples that involve a matrix. Example  three -- and this is important -- coming from a matrix at -- we always  call A.</p> <p>So the transformation will be, multiply by A.</p> <p>There  is a linear transformation. And a whole family of them, because every  matrix produces a transformation by this simple rule, just multiply  every vector by that matrix, and it's linear, right? Linear, I have to  check that A(v) -- A times v plus w equals Av plus A w, which is fine,  and I have to check that A times vc equals c A(v).</p> <p>Check. Those are fine.</p> <p>So  there is a linear transformation. And if I take my favorite matrix A,  and I apply it to all vectors in the plane, it will produce a bunch of  outputs. See, the idea is now worth thinking of, like, the big picture.</p> <p>The whole plane is transformed by matrix multiplication.</p> <p>Every vector in the plane gets multiplied by A.</p> <p>Let's  take an example, and see what happens to the vectors of the house. So  this is still a transformation from plane to plane, and let me take a  particular matrix A -- well, if I cooked up a rotation matrix, this  would be the right picture.</p> <p>If I cooked up a projection matrix,  the projection would be the picture. Let me just take some other matrix.  Let me take the matrix one zero zero minus one. What happens to the  house, to all vectors, and in particular, we can sort of visualize it if  we look at the house -- so the house is not rotated any more, what do I  get? What happens to all the vectors if I do this transformation? I  multiply by this matrix. Well, of course, it's an easy matrix, it's  diagonal.</p> <p>The x component stays the same, the y component  reverses sign, so that like the roof of that house, the point, the tip  of the roof, has an x component which stays the same, but its y  component reverses, and it's down here.</p> <p>And, of course, what we get is, the house is, like, upside down.</p> <p>Now,  I have to put -- where does the door go? I guess the door goes upside  down there, right? So here's the input, here's the input house, and this  is the output. OK.</p> <p>This idea of a linear transformation is like kind of the abstract description of matrix multiplication.</p> <p>And  what's our goal here? Our goal is to understand linear transformations,  and the way to understand them is to find the matrix that lies behind  them.</p> <p>That's really the idea. Find the matrix that lies behind them. Um, and to do that, we have to bring in coordinates.</p> <p>We  have to choose a basis. So let me point out what's the story -- if we  have a linear transformation -- so start with -- start. Suppose we have a  linear transformation. Let -- from now on, let T stand for linear  transformations.</p> <p>I won't be interested in the nonlinear ones.</p> <p>Only linear transformations I'm interested in.</p> <p>OK.  I start with a linear transformation T. Let's suppose its inputs are  vectors in R^3. OK? And suppose its outputs are vectors in R^2, for  example. OK.</p> <p>What's an example of such a transformation, just  before I go any further? Any matrix of the right size will do this. So  what would be the right shape of a matrix? So, for example -- I'm  wanting to give you an example, just because, here, I'm thinking of  transformations that take three-dimensional space to two-dimensional  space. And I want them to be linear, and the easy way to invent them is a  matrix multiplication. So example, T of v should be any A v. Those  transformations are linear, that's what 18.06 is about. And A should be  what size, what shape of matrix should that be? I want V to have three  components, because this is what the inputs have -- so here's the input  in R^3, and here's the output in R^2.</p> <p>So what shape of matrix? So  this should be, I guess, a two by three matrix? Right? A two by three  matrix. A two by three matrix, we'll multiply a vector in R^3 -- you see  I'm moving to coordinates so quickly, I'm not a true physicist here. A  two by three matrix, we'll multiply a vector in R^3 an produce an output  in R^2, and it will be a linear transformation, and OK.</p> <p>So  there's a whole lot of examples, every two by three matrix give me an  example, and basically, I want to show you that there are no other  examples.</p> <p>Every linear transformation is associated with a matrix.</p> <p>Now, let me come back to the idea of linear transformation.</p> <p>Suppose I've got this linear transformation in my mind, and I want to tell you what it is.</p> <p>Suppose I tell you what the transformation does to one vector. OK.</p> <p>You  know one thing, then. All right. So this is like the -- what I'm  speaking about now is, how much information is needed to know the  transformation? By knowing T, I -- to know T of v for all v. All inputs.</p> <p>How  much information do I have to give you so that you know what the  transformation does to every vector? OK, I could tell you what the  transformation -- so I could take a vector v1, one particular vector,  tell you what the transformation does to it -- fine. But now you only  know what the transformation does to one vector.</p> <p>So you say, OK, that's not enough, tell me what it does to another vector.</p> <p>So  I say, OK, give me a vector, you give me a vector v2, and we see, what  does the transformation do to v2? Now, you only know -- or do you only  know what the transformation does to two vectors? Have I got to ask you  -- answer you about every vector in the whole input space, or can you,  knowing what it does to v1 and v2, how much do you now know about the  transformation? You know what the transformation does to a larger bunch  of vectors than just these two, because you know what it does to every  linear combination. You know what it does, now, to the whole plane of  vectors, with bases v1 and v2. I'm assuming v1 and v2 were independent.  If they were dependent, if v2 was six times v1, then I didn't give you  any new information in T of v2, you already knew it would be six times T  of v1. So you can see what I'd headed for. If I know what the  transformation does to every vector in a basis, then I know everything.  So the information needed to know T of v for all inputs is T of v1, T of  v2, up to T of vm, let's say, or vn, for any basis -- for a basis v1 up  to vn. This is a base for any -- can I call it an input basis? It's a  basis for the space of inputs.</p> <p>The things that T is acting on.  You see this point, that if I have a basis for the input space, and I  tell you what the transformation does to every one of those basis  vectors, that is all I'm allowed to tell you, and it's enough to know T  of v for all v-s, because why? Because every v is some combination of  these basis vectors, c1v1+...+cnvn, that's what a basis is, right? It  spans the space.</p> <p>And if I know what T does to this, and what T does to v2, and what T does to vn, then I know what T does to V.</p> <p>By this linearity, it has to be c1 T of v1 plus O one plus cn T of vn. There's no choice.</p> <p>So,  the point of this comment is that if I know what T does to a basis, to  each vector in a basis, then I know the linear transformation. The  property of linearity tells me all the other vectors. All the other  outputs.</p> <p>OK. So now, we got -- so that light we now see, what do  we really need in a linear transformation, and we're ready to go to a  matrix.</p> <p>OK. What's the step now that takes us from a linear  transformation that's free of coordinates to a matrix that's been  created with respect to coordinates? The matrix is going to come from  the coordinate system.</p> <p>These are the coordinates. Coordinates  mean a basis is decided. Once you decide on a basis -- this is where  coordinates come from.</p> <p>You decide on a basis, then every vector,  these are the coordinates in that basis. There is one and only one way  to express v as a combination of the basis vectors, and the numbers you  need in that combination are the coordinates.</p> <p>Let me write that down. So what are coordinates? Coordinates come from a basis. Coordinates come from a basis.</p> <p>The coordinates of v, the coordinates of v are these numbers that tell you how much of each basis vector is in v.</p> <p>If  I change the basis, I change the coordinates, right? Now, we have  always been assuming that were working with a standard basis, right? The  basis we don't even think about this stuff, because if I give you the  vector v equals three two four, you have been assuming completely -- and  probably rightly -- that I had in mind the standard basis, that this  vector was three times the first coordinate vector, and two times the  second, and four times the third.</p> <p>But you're not entitled -- I  might have had some other basis in mind. This is like the standard  basis. And then the coordinates are sitting right there in the vector.</p> <p>But  I could have chosen a different basis, like I might have had  eigenvectors of a matrix, and I might have said, OK, that's a great  basis, I'll use the eigenvectors of this matrix as my basis vectors.</p> <p>Which are not necessarily these three, but some other basis.</p> <p>So  that was an example, this is the real thing, the coordinates are these  numbers, I'll circle them again, the amounts of each basis. OK.</p> <p>So,  if I want to create a matrix that describes a linear transformation,  now I'm ready to do that. OK, OK. So now what I plan to do is construct  the matrix A that represents, or tells me about, a linear  transformation, linear transformation T.</p> <p>OK. So I really start  with the transformation -- whether it's a projection or a rotation, or  some strange movement of this house in the plane, or some transformation  from n-dimensional space to -- or m-dimensional space to n-dimensional  space.</p> <p>n to m, I guess. Usually, we'll have T, we'll somehow  transform n-dimensional space to m-dimensional space, and the whole  point is that if I have a basis for n-dimensional space -- I guess I  need two bases, really. I need an input basis to describe the inputs,  and I need an output basis to give me coordinates -- to give me some  numbers for the output.</p> <p>So I've got to choose two bases.</p> <p>Choose  a basis v1 up to vn for the inputs, for the inputs in -- they came from  R^n. So the transformation is taking every n-dimensional vector into  some m-dimensional vector.</p> <p>And I have to choose a basis, and I'll call them w1 up to wn, for the outputs. Those are guys in R^m.</p> <p>Once  I've chosen the basis, that settles the matrix -- I now working with  coordinates. Every vector in R^n, every input vector has some  coordinates.</p> <p>So here's what I do, here's what I do.</p> <p>Can I say it in words? I take a vector v.</p> <p>I  express it in its basis, in the basis, so I get its coordinates. Then  I'm going to multiply those coordinates by the right matrix A, and that  will give me the coordinates of the output in the output basis.</p> <p>I'd better write that down, that was a mouthful.</p> <p>What  I want -- I want a matrix A that does what the linear transformation  does. And it does it with respecting these bases. So I want the matrix  to be -- well, let's suppose -- look, let me take an example. Let me  take the projection example.</p> <p>The projection example. Suppose I  take -- because we've got that -- we've got that projection in mind -- I  can fit in here. Here's the projection example.</p> <p>So the projection example, I'm thinking of n and m as two.</p> <p>The  transformation takes the plane, takes every vector in the plane, and,  let me draw the plane, just so we remember it's a plane -- and there's  the thing that I'm projecting onto, that's the line I'm projecting onto  -- so the transformation takes every vector in the plane and projects it  onto that line. So this is projection, so I'm going to do projection.</p> <p>OK.  But, I'm going to choose a basis that I like better than the standard  basis. My basis -- in fact, I'll choose the same basis for inputs and  for outputs, and the basis will be -- my first basis vector will be  right on the line.</p> <p>There's my first basis vector. Say, a unit  vector, on the line. And my second basis vector will be a unit vector  perpendicular to that line.</p> <p>And I'm going to choose that as the  output basis, also. And I'm going to ask you, what's the matrix? What's  the matrix? How do I describe this transformation of projection with  respect to this basis? OK? So what's the rule? I take any vector v, it's  some combination of the first basis ve- vector, and the second basis  vector. Now, what is T of v? Suppose the input is -- well, suppose the  input is v1.</p> <p>What's the output? v1, right? The projection leaves this one alone.</p> <p>So  we know what the projection does to this first basis vector, this guy,  it leaves it. What does the projection do to the second basis vector? It  kills it, sends it to zero. So what does the projection do to a  combination? It kills this part, and this part, it leaves alone.</p> <p>Now, all I want to do is find the matrix.</p> <p>I  now want to find the matrix that takes an input, c1 c2, the  coordinates, and gives me the output, c1 0. You see that in this basis,  the coordinates of the input were c1, c2, and the coordinates of the  output are c1, 0.</p> <p>And of course, not hard to find a matrix that will do that. The matrix that will do that is the matrix one, zero, zero, zero.</p> <p>Because  if I multiply input by that matrix A -- this is A times input  coordinates -- and I'm hoping to get the output coordinates. And what do  I get from that multiplication? I get the right answer, c1 and zero. So  what's the point? So the first point is, there's a matrix that does the  job. If there's a linear transformation out there, coordinate-free, no  coordinates, and then I choose a basis for the inputs, and I choose a  basis for the outputs, then there's a matrix that does the job.</p> <p>And what's the job? It multiplies the input coordinates and produces the output coordinates.</p> <p>Now, in this example -- let me repeat, I chose the input basis was the same as the output basis.</p> <p>The  input basis and output basis were both along the line, and  perpendicular to the line. They're actually the eigenvectors of the  projection. And, as a result, the matrix came out diagonal. In fact, it  came out to be lambda. This is like, the good basis. So the good -- the  eigenvector basis is the good basis, it leads to the matrix -- the  diagonal matrix of eigenvalues lambda, and just as in this example, the  eigenvectors and eigenvalues of this linear transformation were along  the line, and perpendicular. The eigenvalues were one and zero, and  that's the matrix that we got.</p> <p>OK. So that's a, like, the great  choice of matrix, that's the choice a physicist would do when he had to  finally -- he or she had to finally bring coordinates in unwillingly,  the coordinates to be chosen, the good coordinates are the eigenvectors,  because, if I did this projection in the standard basis -- which I  could do, right? I could do the whole thing in the standard basis -- I  better try, if I can do that. What are we calling -- so I'll have to  tell you now which line we're projecting on.</p> <p>Say, the 45 degree  line. So say we're projecting onto 45 degree line, and we use not the  eigenvector basis, but the standard basis. The standard basis, v1, is  one, zero, and v2 is zero, one. And again, I'll use the same basis for  the outputs. Then I have to do this -- I can find a matrix, it will be  the matrix that we would always think of, it would be the projection  matrix. It will be, actually, it's the matrix that we learned about in  chapter four, it's what I call the matrix -- do you remember, P was A, A  transpose over A transpose A? And I think, in this example, it will  come out, one-half, one-half, one-half, one-half. I believe that's the  matrix that comes from our formula. And that's the matrix that will do  the job. If I give you this input, one, zero, what's the output? The  output is one-half, one-half. And that should be the right projection.  And if I give you the input zero, one, the output is, again, one-half,  one-half, again the projection. So that's the matrix, but not diagonal  of course, because we didn't choose a great basis, we just chose the  handiest basis.</p> <p>Well, so the course has practically been about  the handiest basis, and just dealing with the matrix that we got. And  it's not that bad a matrix, it's symmetric, and it has this P squared  equal P property, all those things are good.</p> <p>But in the best basis, it's easy to see that P squared equals P, and it's symmetric, and it's diagonal.</p> <p>So  that's the idea then, is, do you see now how I'm associating a matrix  to the transformation? I'd better write the rule down, I'd better write  the rule down.</p> <p>The rule to find the matrix A. All right, first column.</p> <p>So, a rule to find A, we're given the bases.</p> <p>Of course, we don't -- because there's no way we could construct the matrix until we're told what the bases are.</p> <p>So we're given the input basis, and the output basis, v1 to vn, w1 to wm. Those are given.</p> <p>Now,  in the first column of A, how do I find that column? The first column  of the matrix. So that should tell me what happens to the first basis  vector.</p> <p>So the rule is, apply the linear transformation to v1. To the first basis vector.</p> <p>And  then, I'll write it -- so that's the output, right? The input is v1,  what's the output? The output is in the output space, it's some  combination of these guys, and it's that combination that goes into the  first column -- so, let me -- I'll put this word -- right, I'll say it  in words again. How to find this matrix. Take the first basis vector.  Apply the transformation, then it's in the output space, T of v1, so  it's some combination of these outputs, this output basis.</p> <p>So that combination, the coefficients in that combination will be the first column -- so a1, a row 2, column 1, w2, am1, wm.</p> <p>There are the numbers in the first column of the matrix.</p> <p>Let me make the point by doing the second column.</p> <p>Second  column of A. What's the idea, now? I take the second basis vector, I  apply the transformation to it, that's in -- now I get an output, so  it's some combination in the output basis -- and that combination is the  bunch of numbers that should go in the second column of the matrix.</p> <p>OK. And so forth.</p> <p>So  I get a matrix, and the matrix I get does the right job. Now, the  matrix constructed that way, and following the rules of matrix  multiplication.</p> <p>The result will be that if I give you the input  coordinates, and I multiply by the matrix, so the outcome of all this is  A times the input coordinates correctly reproduces the output  coordinates. Why is this right? Let me just check the first column.</p> <p>Suppose the input coordinates are one and all zeros.</p> <p>What  does that mean? What's the input? If the input coordinates are one and  other -- and the rest zeros, then the input is v1, right? That's the  vector that has coordinates one and all zeros.</p> <p>OK? When I  multiply A by the one and all zeros, I'll get the first column of A,  I'll get these numbers. And, sure enough, those are the output  coordinates for T of v1. So we made it right on the first column, we  made it right on the second column, we made it right on all the basis  vectors, and then it has to be right on every vector. OK.</p> <p>So  there is a picture of the matrix for a linear transformation. Finally,  let me give you another -- a different linear transformation.</p> <p>The linear transformation that takes the derivative.</p> <p>That's a linear transformation. Suppose the input space is all combination c1 plus c2x plus c3 x squared.</p> <p>So the basis is these simple functions.</p> <p>Then what's the output? Is the derivative.</p> <p>The output is the derivative, so the output is c2+2c3 x.</p> <p>And let's take as output basis, the vectors one and x.</p> <p>So  we're going from a three-dimensional space of inputs to a  two-dimensional space of outputs by the derivative. And I don't know if  you ever thought that the derivative is linear.</p> <p>But if it weren't  linear, taking derivatives would take forever, right? We are able to  compute derivatives of functions exactly because we know it's a linear  transformation, so that if we learn the derivatives of a few functions,  like sine x and cos x and e to the x, and another little short list,  then we can take all their combinations and we can do all the  derivatives.</p> <p>OK, now what's the matrix? What's the matrix? So I  want the matrix to multiply these input vectors -- input coordinates,  and give these output coordinates. So I just think, OK, what's the  matrix that does it? I can follow my rule of construction, or I can see  what the matrix is.</p> <p>It should be a two by three matrix, right?  And the matrix -- so I'm just figuring out, what do I want? No, I'll --  let me write it here. What do I want from my matrix? What should that  matrix do? Well, I want to get c2 in the first output, so zero, one,  zero will do it. I want to get two c3, so zero, zero, two will do it.  That's the matrix for this linear transformation with those bases and  those coordinates. You see, it just clicks, and the whole point is that  the inverse matrix gives the inverse to the linear transformation, that  the product of two matrices gives the right matrix for the product of  two transformations -- matrix multiplication really came from linear  transformations.</p> <p>I'd better pick up on that theme Monday after Thanksgiving.</p> <p>And I hope you have a great holiday.</p> <p>I hope Indian summer keeps going.</p> <p>OK, see you on Monday.</p>
