18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2010 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 6 

Okay. This is lecture six in linear algebra, and we're at the start of this new chapter, 
chapter three in the text, which is rea lly getting to the center of linear a lgebra. And I 
had time to make a first start on it at the end of lecture five. 

But now is lecture six is officially the lecture on vector spaces and subspaces. And 
then especially -- there are two subspaces that we're specially  interested in. One is 
the column space of a matrix, the other is the null space of the matrix. So, I got to 
tell you what those are. Okay. 

So, first to remember from lecture five, what is a vector space? It's a bunch of 
vectors that -- where I'm allowed -- where I can add -- I can add any two vectors in 
the space and the answer stays in the space. Or I can multiply any vector in the 
space by any constant and the result stays in the space. So that's -- in fact if I 
combine those two into one, you can see that -- if I can add and I can multiply by 
numbers, that really means that I can take linear combinations. So  the quick way to 
say it is that a ll linear combinations, C -- any multiple of V p lus any multip le of W 
stay in the space. 

So, can I g ive you examples that are vector spaces and also some examples that are 
not, to make that point clear? So, suppose I'm in three dimensions. 

Then one way to get us one space is the whole three d imensiona l space. So the 
whole space R^3, three dimensional space, would be a vector space, because if I 
have a couple of vectors I can add them and I'm certa inly okay and they follow all 
the rules. 

So R^3 is easy. Now I'm interested also in subspaces. So there's this key word, 
subspaces. That's a space -- that's some vectors inside the g iven space,  inside R 
three that still make up a vector space of their own. It's a vector space inside a 
vector space. And the simplest example was a p lane. So, like, can I just sketch it --
there is a p lane. It's got to go through the origin, and of course it goes infinitely far. 

That's of that's a subspace now. 

Do you see that if I have two vectors on the p lane and I add them, the result stays 
in the plane. 

If I take a vector in the p lane and I multiply by minus two, I'm still in the p lane. So 
that plane  is a subspace. 

So let me just make that point. P lane through zero, through that zero zero zero is a 
subspace. 

Okay. And a lso, another subspace would be a line. A line through zero zero zero --
yeah, the line has to go through the orig in. 

All subspaces have got to contain the origin, contain zero -- the zero vector. 

So this line is a subspace. Really, if I want to say it rea lly correctly, I should say a 
subspace of R^3. 

That of R^3 was, like, understood there. 

Now -- so let me ca ll this p lane P. 

And let me ca ll this line L. And let me ask you about other sets of vectors. Suppose I 
took -- yeah -- so here's a first question. 

Suppose I take two subspaces,  like P and L. 

And I just put them together, take their union, take a ll the vectors -- so now you've 
got P and L in mind, here. So I have two subspaces. 

I have two subspaces and, for examp le, P -- a p lane and L a line. Okay. 

Now I want to ask you about the union of those. 

So P union L. This is a ll vectors in P or L or both. Is that a subspace? Is this a 
subspace? This is or is not a subspace? Because we're -- I just want to be sure that 
I've got the centra l idea. Suppose I take the vectors in the plane and also the 
vectors on that line, put them together, so I've got a bunch of vectors,  is it a 
subspace? Can you give me, like, so the camera can hear it or maybe the tape. 

Can you say yes or no? Do I have a subspace if I put -- if I take all the vectors on 
the p lane p lus all -- and all the ones on the line and just join them together -- but 
I'm not taking  this guy that's -- actually, I'm not taking most of them, because most 
vectors are not on the line or the p lane, they're off somewhere else. 

Do I have a subspace? STUDENTS: No. 

STRANG: Right. Thank you. 

No. Because -- why not? Because I can't add. Because  if I that requirement isn't 
satisfied. If I take one vector like this guy and another vector that happens to come 
from L and add, I'm off somewhere else. You see that I've gone outside the union if I 
just add something from P and something from L, then normally what'll happen is 
I'm outside the union -- and I don't have a subspace. So the correct answer is -- is 
not. Okay. 

Now let me ask you about -- the other thing we do is take the intersection. So what 
does intersection mean? Intersection means all vectors that are  in both P and L. 

Is this a subspace. Yeah, so I guess I want to go back up to the same question. This 
is or is not a subspace? And you can answer me -- answer the question first for this 
particular example, this p icture I drew. 

What is P intersect L  for this case? STUDENT: It's only zero. STRANG: It's only zero. 

At least, sort of this was the artist's idea as he drew it that, that that line L was not 
in the plane and, went off somewhere else -- and then the only point that was in 
common was the zero vector. 

Is the zero vector by  itself a subspace? STUDENT: Yes. STRANG: Yes, absolutely. 
And what about, if I don't have this plane and this line but any subspace and any 
other subspace? So now -- can I ask that question for any two subspaces? So maybe 
I'll write it up here. If I'm strong enough. Okay. So this is the general question. 

I have subspaces, say S and T. And I want to ask you about their intersection S 
intersect T and I want -- it  is a subspace. Do you see why? Do you see why if I take 
the vectors that are in both one- th- that are in both of the subspaces -- so that's 
like a smaller set of vectors, probab ly, because it's -- we've added  requirements. It 
has to be in S and in T. How do I know that's a subspace? Can we just think through 
that abstract stuff and then I get to the examp les. Okay. 

So why? Suppose I take a couple of vectors that are in the intersection. 

Why is the sum a lso in the intersection? Okay, so let me g ive a name to  these 
vectors, say V and W. They're in the intersection. 

So that means they're both in S. 

Also means they're both in T. So what can I say about V plus W? Is it in S? Yes. 
Right? If I take two vectors, V and W that are both in S, then the sum is in S, 
because S was a subspace. 

And if they're both in T and I add them, then the result is a lso in T, because T was a 
subspace. 

So the result V plus W is in the intersection. 

It's in both and requirement one is satisfied. 

Requirement two's the same. If I take a vector that's in both, I multiply by seven. 
Seven times that vector is in S, because the vector was in S. Seven times that 
vector's in T because the origina l one was in T. 

So seven times that vector is in the intersection. 

In other words, when you take the intersection of two subspaces, you get probably a 
sma ller subspace, but it is a subspace. Okay. 

So that's like sort of just emphasizing what these two requirements mean. Aga in --
Let me circle those, because those are so  important. 

The sum and the sca le of multiplication which combines into linear combinations. 
That's what you have to do inside the subspace. Okay. 

On to the column space. Okay. 

So my lecture last time started that and I want to continue it. 

Okay. Column space of a matrix. 

Of A. Okay. 

Can I take an example? Say one two three four. 

One one one one. Two three four five. 

Okay. That's my matrix A. 

So, it's got columns, three columns. 

Those columns are vectors, so the column space of this A, of this A -- let's stay with 
this example for a while. 

The column space of this matrix is a subspace of R -- R what? So what space are we 
in if I'm looking at the columns of this matrix? R^4 , right? These are vectors in 
R^4, they're four dimensional vectors. So it's this column space of A is a subspace of 
R^4 here, because A was four by -- A is a four by three matrix. This tells me how 
many rows there are, how many components in a column, and so we're  in R^4. 
Okay, now what's in that subspace? So the column space of A, it's a subspace of 
R^4. I ca ll it the column space of A, like that. So that's my little symbol for some 
subspace of R^4. What's in that subspace? Well, that column certainly is. One two 
three four. This column is in. This column is  in, and what else? So  it's got the 
columns of A in it, but that's not enough, certa inly. Right? I don't have a subspace if 
I just put in three vectors. So how do I fill that out to be a subspace? I take their 
linear combinations. So the column space of A is all linear comb inations --
combinations of the columns. 

And that does give me a subspace. 

It does give me a vector space, because if I have one linear combination and I 
multip ly by eleven, I've got another linear combination. If I have a linear 
combination, I add to another linear comb ination I get a third combination. So that -
- this  is like the sma llest space -- like, it's got to have those three columns in it, and 
it has to have their combinations and that's where we stop. 

Okay. Now  I'm going to be interested in that space. So I,  like -- get some idea of 
what's in that space. How big is that space? Is that space the whole four dimensional 
space? Or is it a subspace inside? Can you -- let me just see  if we can get a yes or 
no answer sometimes without being  ready for the complete proof. What do you 
think? Is the subspace that I'm talking about here, the comb inations of those three 
guys, does that fill the full four dimensional space? Maybe yes or no on that one. 

No. No. 

Somehow our feeling is, and it happens to be right, that if we start with three 
vectors and take their combinations, we can't get the whole four dimensional space. 
Now -- so somehow we get a sma ller space. But how much smaller? That's going to 
come up here. That's not so immed iate. 

Let me first make this critica l connection with -- with,  linear equations, because 
behind our abstract definition, we have a purpose. And that is to understand Ax=b. 

So suppose I make the connection -- w- w- does A x=b always have a solution for 
every b? Have a solution for every right-hand side? I guess that's going to be a yes 
or no question. 

And then I'm going to ask which right-hand sides are okay? That's rea lly the 
question I'm after, is which right-hand sides (b) do make up -- you can see from the 
way I'm speaking what the question -- As it is. 

The answer is no. A x=b does not have a solution for every b. Why do I say no? 
Because A x=b is -- like, this  is four equations, and only three unknowns. R ight? X is 
-- let me right out that whole -- what the whole thing looks like. Yeah. 

Let me write out A x=b. A x is -- these columns are one two three four. One one one 
one and  two three four five. Then x, of course, has three components, x1, x2, x3. 

And I'm trying to get the -- hit the right-hand side, b1,b2,b3 and b4. So my first 
point  is, I can't always do it. In a way, that just says again what you told me five 
minutes ago -- that the comb inations of these columns don't fill the whole four 
dimensional space. There's going to be some vectors b, a lot of vectors b, that are 
not comb inations of these three columns, because the combinations of those 
columns are, like, going to be just a  little plane or something inside -- inside R^4. 

Now, so and you see that I do have four equations and only three unknowns. So, like 
anybody is going to say, no you dope, you can't usua lly solve four equations with 
only three unknowns. 

But now I want to say sometimes you can. 

For some right-hand sides, I can solve this. 

So that's the bunch of right-hand sides that I'm  interested in right now. Which right-
hand sides allow me to solve this? This is the question for today. 

It's going to have,  like, a nice clear answer. 

So my question is -- is which bs, which vectors b, allow this system to be solved? 
And I want to ask you -- so that's, like, gets two question marks to indicate that's --
this is the important question. Okay, first, before we give a tota l answer, give me 
just a partial answer. Tell me one right-hand side that I know I can solve this thing 
for. 

So -- all zeroes. Okay. 

That's the, like, guaranteed. 

If these were all zero, then I know I can solve  it, let the x-s a ll be zero, no problem. 
Okay. So that's a lways a -- okay. 

A x=0 I can always solve. Now tell me another right-hand side, just a specific set of 
numbers for which I can solve these three -- these four equations with only three 
unknowns, but if you give me a good right-hand side, I can do it. 

So tell me one? STUDENT:1 2 3 4. 

STRANG: 1 2 3 4? If I -- can I solve -- is that a good right-hand side? Can you solve 
-- can you find a solution that -- X one p lus X two plus two X three is one, two X one 
plus X two plus three X three is two and two more equations -- so I'm asking you to 
solve in your head in -- within five seconds, four equations and three unknowns, but 
you can do it, because the right-hand side is, like, showing up here is -- it's one of 
the columns. So tell me what's the X that does solve it? One zero zero. 

One zero zero solves it, because -- well, so you can multiply this out by rows, but oh 
God, it's much nicer to say -- okay, this is one of this column, zero of this, zero of 
this, so it's one of that column, which is exactly what we wanted. Okay. 

So there is a b that's okay. Now tell me another B that's okay, another right-hand 
side that would be all right? Well -- a ll ones? Actually -- and then what's the solution 
in that case? 0 1 0, thanks. 

And, in  fact, it's much e- like, one way to do it is think of a solution first, right, and 
then just see what b turns out to be. 

What b turns out to be, right. Okay. So I think of a solution -- so I think of an x, I 
think of any -- x1, x2, x3, I do this multip lication and what have I got? Now I'm 
ready to answer the big question. I can solve A x=b exactly when the right-hand side 
B is a vector in the column space. 

Good. I can solve A x=b when b is a comb ination of the columns, when it's in the 
column space -- so let me write that answer down. 

I can solve Ax=b exactly when B  is in the column space. 

Let me just say again why that is. Because it -- the column space by its definition 
contains all the comb inations. It conta ins all the Ax-s. 

The column space rea lly consists of all vectors A times any X. So those are the bs 
that I can deal with. If b is a comb ination of the columns, then that comb ination tells 
me what X should be. 

If b is not a combination of the columns, then there is no x. 

There's no way to solve A x equa l b. 

Okay. So the column space -- that's really why we're interested in this column space, 
because it's the central guy. It says when we can solve, and that -- we got to 
understand this column space better. Let's see. 

Do I want to  think -- yeah, somehow -- oh, well, let's just -- as long as we've got it 
here, what do I get for this particular examp le? If I take combinations of this and 
this and this, I'll tell you the question that's in my mind. 

It's not even proper to use this word yet, but you'll know what it means. Are those 
three columns independent? If I take the combinations of the three columns -- does 
each column contribute something new or now? So that if I take the comb inations of 
those three columns, do I, like, get some three dimensional subspace -- do I have 

three vectors that are,  like, you know, independent, whatever that means? Or do I --
is one of those columns, like, contributing nothing new -- So that actua lly only two of 
the columns would have given the same column space? Yeah -- that's a good way to 
ask the question. F ina lly I think of it. Can I throw away any columns -- and have the 
same column space? STUDENT: Yes. 

STRANG: Yes. And which one do you suggest I throw away? STUDENT: Column three 
-- three. 

STRANG: Well, three  is the natura l, like, guy to target. So if I -- and why? Because -
- what's so bad about three here? Column three? It's the sum of these, right? So it's 
not -- if I'm taking -- if I have combinations of these two and I put in this one, 
actually, I don't get anything more. So later on I will ca ll these pivot columns. 

And the third guy will not be a pivot column in this -- with those numbers. Now 
actually -- honesty makes me ask you this question. Could  I have thrown away 
column one? Yes, I could. 

I could. So when I say pivot columns, my convention is, okay, I'll keep the first ones 
as long as they're not dependent. 

So I keep this guy, he's fine, he's a line. 

I keep the second guy. It's in a second direction. 

But the third one, which is in the same plane as the first two g ives me nothing new. 
It's dependent in the language that we w ill use and I don't need it. Okay. 

So I would describe the column space of this matrix as a two d imensiona l subspace 
of R^4. A two d imensiona l subspace of R^4. Okay. 

So you're seeing how these vector spaces work and you -- you're seeing that we --
some idea of dependence or independence is  in our future. Okay. 

Now I want to speak about another vector space, the null space. So again I'm 
getting a little ahead because  it's in section three point two, but that's okay. All right. 

Now I'm ready for the null space. 

Let me keep the same matrix. And this is going  to be a d ifferent -- totally different 
subspace. 

Tota lly different. Okay. 

Now -- so let me make space for it. 

Now -- here comes a completely d ifferent subspace, the null space of A. 

What's in it? It contains not right-hand sides b. It contains x-s. 

It conta ins all x-s that solve -- this word null is going to -- I mean, that's the key 
word here, meaning zero. 

So this contains -- this is all solutions x, and of course x is our vectors, x1, x2 and 
x3, to the equation A x=0. Well, four equations, because we've got -- so, do you see 
what I'm doing? I'm now saying, okay, columns were great, the column space we 
understood. Now I'm interested in x-s. 

I'm not -- the only b I'm interested in now is the b of all zeroes. The right-hand side 
is now zeroes. And I'm interested in solutions. x-s. 

So t- where is this null space for this examp le? These x-s are -- have three 
components. 

So the null space is a subspace -- we still have to show it is a subspace -- of R^3. So 
this is -- and we w ill show -- these vectors x, this is  in R^3, where the column space 
was in R^4  in our example. 

For an m by n matrix, this is m and this is n, because the number of columns, n, tells 
me how many unknowns, how many x-s multip ly those columns, so it tells me the 
big space, in this case R three that I'm  in. 

Now tell me -- why don't we figure out what the null space is for this examp le, just 
by looking at it. 

I mean, that's the beauty of sma ll examples, that my officia l way to  find null spaces 
and column spaces and get all the facts straight would be elimination, and we'll do 
that. But w ith a small examp le, we can see that -- see what's going on without going 
through the mechanics of elimination. 

So this null space -- so I'm talking about -- aga in, the null space, and let me copy 
again the matrix. One two three four, one one one one and two three four five. 

What's in the null space? So I'm taking A times x, so  let me right it aga in, and  I want 
you to solve those four equations. In fact, I want you to find a ll solutions to those 
four equations. 

Well, actua lly, just first of a ll find one. 

Why should I ask you for a ll of them? Tell me one -- well, tell me one solution that y-
you don't even have to look at the matrix to know one solution to  this set of 
equations. It is zero vector. 

Whatever that matrix is, its null space contains zero -- because A times the zero 
vector sure gives the zero right-hand side. So the null space certa inly contains zero. 
A- so it's got a chance to be a vector space now, and it w ill turn out it is. 

Okay. Tell me another solution. 

So this particular null space -- and of course I'm going to ca ll it N(A) for null space --
this conta ins-- well we've already located the zero vector, and now you're going to 
tell me another vector that's in the null space, another solution, another x, another -
- you see what I'm asking you for is a combination of those columns. 

That's what I'm a lways looking at combinations of columns, but now I'm looking at 
the weights, the coefficients in the combination. So tell me a good set of numbers to 
put in there. One one -- STUDENTS: M inus one. STRANG: One one minus one. 

Thanks. One one minus one. 

So there's a vector that's in it. 

Okay. But have I got a subspace at this point? Certainly not, right? I've got just a 
coup le of vectors. No way they make a subspace. 

Tell me -- actually, why don't I jump the whole way now? Tell me -- well, tell me one 
more solution, one more X that would work. 

Student: 2 2 -2. STRANG: 2 2 -2? Oh, well, tell me all of them, that would have been 
easier. 

Tell me the whole lot, now. 

What is the null space for this matrix? It's a ll vectors of the form -- what could this 
be? It could be one one minus one, it could be it could be any number C, any 
number -- the same number aga in and -- STUDENTS: M inus. STRANG: Minus C. 

In other words -- actua lly, any multip le of this guy. 

Oh, that's the perfect description, because now  the zero vector's automatically 
included because C could be zero. The vector I had is included, because C could be 
one. But now any vector. 

And that's actually it. And do I have a subspace? And what does it look like? It's in --
how would you describe this, the null space,  this -- a ll these vectors of this form C C 
minus C, like, seven seven minus seven. 

Minus eleven minus eleven plus eleven. 

What have I got here? If -- describe that whole null space of -- what -- if I drew it, 
what do I draw? A line, right? The null space is a line. 

It's the line through -- in R^3 and the vector one one negative one maybe goes 
down here, I don't know where it goes, say, down here. There's the vector one one 
negative one that you gave me. And where is the vector C C negative C? It's on this 
line. 

Of course, there's zero zero zero that we had. 

And what we've got is that whole -- oops -- that whole line, going both ways, 
through the origin. 

The null space is a line in R^3. 

Okay. For that examp le, we could find a ll the combinations of the columns that gave 
zero at sight. Now, can I just take one more time, to go back to the definition of 
subspace, vector space, and ask you -- how do I know that the null space is a vector 

space? How I entitled to use this word space? I'll never use that word space w ithout 
meaning that the two requirements are satisfied. Can we just check that they are? 
So I'm going to check that -- can I just continue here? Check that -- that the 
solutions to A x=0 always give a subspace. 

And, of course, the key word is that= "Space." So what do I have to check? I have to 
show  that if I have one solution, ca ll it x, and another solution, ca ll it x*, that their 
sum is also a solution, right? That's a  requirement. To use that word space, I have to 
say -- I have to convince myself that if A x is zero and also -- and A x* is zero, or 
maybe I should have said if A v is zero and A w  is zero, then what about v p lus w? 
Shall I -- let me use those  letters. 

If A v is zero and A w is zero, then what -- if that and that, then what's my point 
here? That A times (v+w) must be zero. 

That says that if v is in the null space and w 's in the null space,  then their sum v+w 
is in the null space. And of course, now that I've written it down, it's tota lly absurd, 
rid iculously simple -- because matrix multiplication a llows me to separate that out 
into A v plus A w. I shouldn't say absurd ly simple. That was a dumb thing to say. 

Could -- we've used, here, a basic law of matrix multip lication. Actually, we've used 
it without proving it, but that's okay. We only live so  long, we just skip that proof. I 
think it's called the distributive law that I can sp lit these -- split this into two pieces. 
But now you see the point, that A v  is zero and A w is zero so I have zero plus zero 
and I do get zero. It checks. 

And, similarly, I have to show that if A v is zero, then A times any multiple, say 12v 
is also zero. And how do I know that? Because I'm a llowed to s- bring that twelve 
outside. A number, a scaler can move outside, so I have twelve A vs, twelve zeroes -
- I have zero. Okay. 

Just to -- it's really critical to understand the -- oh yeah. 

Here -- I was going to say, understand what's the point of a vector space? Let me 
make that point by chang ing the right-hand side. Oops. 

Okay. Let me change the right-hand side to one two  three four. Oh, okay. 

Why don't we do a ll of linear algebra in one lecture, then we -- okay. I would like to 
know the solutions to this equation. For those four equations. 

So I have four equations. I have only three unknowns, so if I don't have a pretty 
special right-hand side there won't be any solution at a ll. But that is a very special 
right-hand side. And we know that there is a solution, one zero zero. Were there any 
more solutions? And did they form a vector space? Okay. So I'm asking two 
questions there. One is, do -- so my right-hand side now is not zero anymore. I'm 
not looking at the null space because I changed from zeroes. 

So my first question is, do the solutions, if there are any and there are, do they form 
a subspace? Let's answer that question first. 

Yes or no. Do I get a subspace if I look at the solutions to -- let me go back to x1 x2 
x3. 

I'm looking at all the x-s, at all those vectors in R^3 that solve A x -b. The only thing 
I've changed is b isn't zero anymore. Do the x-s, the solutions, form a vector space? 
The solutions to this do not form a subspace. The solutions don't, because -- how 
sha ll I see that? The zero vector is not a solution, so I never even got started. The 
zero vector doesn't solve this system. I can't -- solutions can't be a vector space. 
Now what are they like? Well, we'll see this, but  let's do  it for this example. So one 
zero zero was a solution. You saw that right away. 

Are there any other solutions? Can you tell me a second solution to this system of 
equations? STUDENTS: 0 -1 1 STRANG: 0 -1 1. 

Boy, that's -- 0 -1 1. Yes. 

Because that says I take minus this column plus this one and sure enough. That's 
right. 

So there are -- there's a bunch of solutions here. But they're not a subspace. 

I'll tell you what it's like. It's like a p lane that doesn't go through the origin, or a line 
that doesn't go  through the origin. Maybe in this case it's a line that doesn't go 
through the origin, if I graft the solutions to A x equa l B. So you -- I think you've got 
the idea. Subspaces have to go through the orig in. If I'm looking at x-s, then they'd 
better solve Ax=0. In a way I've got -- my two subspaces that I -- talking about 
today are kind of the two ways I can tell you what a -- about subspace. If I want to 
tell you about the column space, I tell you a few columns and I say take their 
combinations. 

Like I build up this subspace. I put in a  few vectors, their combinations make a 
subspace. 

Now, when I went to -- let me come back to the one that is a subspace here. Here, 
when I talked about the null space, I didn't tell you what's in it. 

We had to  figure out what was in it. 

What I told you was the equations that I'm -- that has to be satisfied. You see those 
-- like, those are the two natural ways to tell you what's in a subspace. I can either 
give you a  few vectors and say fill it out, take combinations -- or I can g ive you a 
system of equations, the requirements that the x-s have to satisfy. And both of those 
ways produce subspaces and they're the  important ways to construct subspaces. 
Okay, so today's lecture actually got, the essentials of three point two, the idea of 
the null space. Now we have to tackle, Wednesday, the job of how do we actually get 
hold of that subspace in an examp le that's bigger and we can't see it just by eye. 
Okay. 

See you Wednesday. Thanks.
