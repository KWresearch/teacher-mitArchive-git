18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2010 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 19 

OK, this is the second lecture on determinants. 

There are only three. With determinants it's a  fascinating, sma ll topic inside linear 
algebra. 

Used to be determinants were the big thing, and linear a lgebra was the little thing, 
but they -- those changed, that situation changed. Now determinants is one specific 
part, very neat little part. 

And my goal today is to find a formula  for the determinant. 

It'll be a messy formula. So that's why you d idn't see it right away. But if I'm g iven 
this n by n matrix then I use those entries to create this number, the determinant. 

So there's a formula for it. In  fact, there's another formula, a second formula using 
something ca lled cofactors. 

So you'll -- you have to know what cofactors are. 

And then I'll app ly those formulas for some, some matrices that have a lot of zeros 
away from the three d iagona ls. OK. 

So I'm shooting now  for a formula for the determinant. 

You remember we started with these three properties, three simp le properties, but 
out of that we got all these amazing facts, like the determinant of A B equa ls 
determinant of A times determinant of B. 

But the three facts were -- oh, how about I just take two by twos. I know, because 
everybody here knows, the determinant of a two by two matrix, but let's get it out of 
these three formulas. 

OK, so here's my, my two by two matrix. 

I'm looking  for a  formula for this determinant. a b c d, OK. So property one, I know 
what to do with the identity. 

Right? Property two a llows me to exchange rows, and I know what to do then. So I 
know that that determinant is one. Property two allows me to exchange rows and 
know that this determinant is minus one. 

And now I want to use property three to get everybody,  to get everybody. And how 
will I do  that? OK. So remember that  if I keep the second row  the same, I'm a llowed 
to use linearity in the first row. And I'll just use it in a simple way. I'll write this 
vector a b as a 0 + 0 b. So that's one step using property three, linearity in the first 

row when the second  row's the same. OK. But now you can guess what I'm going to 
do next. I'll -- because I'd like to -- if I can make the matrices diagonal, then I'm 
clearly there. 

So I'll take this one. Now I'll keep the first row  fixed and split the second row, so 
that'll be an a 0 and I'll split that into a c 0 and, keep ing that first row the same, a 0 
d. I used, for this part, linearity. And now I'll -- whoops, that's p lus because I've got 
more coming. 

This one I'll do the same. I'll keep this first row the same and I'll split c d into c 0 
and 0 d. OK. 

Now I've got four easy determinants, and two of them are -- well, all four are 
extremely easy. 

Two of them are so easy as to turn into zero, right? Which two of these determinants 
are zero right away? The first guy is zero. 

Why is he zero? Why is that determinant nothing, forget him? Well, it has a column 
of zeros. 

And by the -- well, so one way to think is, well, it's a singular matrix. Oh,  for, for like 
forty-eight d ifferent reasons, that determinant is zero. It's a singular matrix that has 
a column of zeros. It's, it's dead. 

And this one  is about as dead too. Column of zeros. OK. 

So that's leaving us w ith this one. 

Now what do I -- how do I know its determinant, following the rules? Well, I guess 
one of the properties that we actua lly got to was the determinant of that -- d iagona l 
matrix, then -- so I, I'm finally getting to that determinant is the a d. 

And this determinant is what? What's this one? Minus -- because I would use 
property two to do a flip to make it c b, then property three to factor out the b, 
property c to  factor out the c -- the property again to factor out the c, and that 
minus, and of course finally I got the answer that we knew we would get. 

But you see the method. You see the method, because  it's method I'm looking for 
here, not just a two by two answer but the method of doing -- now I can do  three by 
threes and four by fours and any size. So if you can see the method of taking each 
row at a time -- so let's -- what would happen w ith three by threes? Can we mentally 
do it rather than I write everything on the board for three by threes? So what would 
we do if I had three by threes? I would keep rows two and three the same and I 
would sp lit the first row into how many pieces? Three pieces. 

I'd have an A zero zero and a zero B zero and a zero zero C or something for the first 
row. 

So I would instead of going  from one piece to two pieces to four pieces, I would go 
from one piece to three pieces to -- what would  it be? Each of those three, would, 
would it be nine? Or twenty-seven? Oh yeah, I've actually got more steps, right. I'd 
go to nine but then I'd have another row to stra ighten out, twenty-seven. 

Yes, oh God. OK, let me say this again then. 

If I -- if it was three by three, I would -- separating out one row into three pieces 
would give me three, separating out the second  row into three pieces, then I'd be up 
to nine, separating out the third  row into its three p ieces, I'd be up to twenty-seven, 
three cubed, p ieces. 

But a lot of them would be zero. 

So now when would they not be zero? Tell me the pieces that would not be zero. 
Now I w ill write the non-zero ones. OK, so I have this matrix. I think I have to use 
these, start using these double symbols here because otherwise I could never do n 
by n. OK. 

OK. So I split this up like crazy. 

A bunch of pieces are zero. Whenever I have a column of zeros, I know I've got zero. 
When do I not have zero? When do I have -- what is it that's  like these guys? These 
are the survivors, two survivors there. 

So my question for three by three is going to be what are the survivors? How many 
survivors are there? What are they? And when do I get a survivor. 

Well, I would get a survivor -- for examp le, one survivor w ill be that one times that 
one times that one, with all zeros everywhere else. That would be one survivor. 

A one one zero zero zero a two two zero zero zero a three three. That's like the a d 
survivor. 

Tell me another survivor. What other thing -- oh, now here you see the clue. Now 
can -- sha ll I just say the whole clue? That I'm having -- the survivors have one 
entry from each row and each column. One entry from each row and column. 

Because if some column is missing, then I get a singular matrix. And that, that's one 
of these guys. See, you see what happened w ith -- this guy? Column one never got 
used in 0 b 0 d. So its determinant was zero and I forget it. So I'm going to forget 
those and just put -- so tell me one more that would be a survivor? Well -- well, 
here's another one. a one one zero zero -- now OK, that's used up row -- row one is 
used. 

Column one is already used so it better be zero. 

What else could I have? Where could I pick the guy -- which column sha ll I use in 
row two? Use column three, because here if I use column -- here I used column one 
and row one. 

This was like the column -- numbers were one two three, right in order. Now the 
column numbers are going to be one three, column three, and column two. 

So the row numbers are one two three, of course. 

The column numbers are some -- OK, some permutation of one two three, and here 
they come in the order one three two. 

It's just like having a permutation matrix with, instead of the ones, with numbers. 

And actually, it's very close to having a permutation matrix, because I, what I do 
eventua lly is I factor out these numbers and then I have got. 

So what is that determinant equa l? I factor those numbers out and I've got a one 
one times a two two times a three three. 

And what does this determinant equal? Yeah, now tell me the, this -- I mean, we're 
really getting to  the heart of these formulas now. 

What is that determinant? By the laws of -- by, by our three properties, I can factor 
these out, I can factor out the a one one, the a two three, and the a three two. 
They're in separate rows. 

I can do each row separately. And then I just have to decide is that p lus sign or is 
that a minus sign? And the answer is it's a minus. Why minus? Because these is one 
row exchange to get it back to the identity. So  that's a minus. 

Now I through? No, because there are other ways. What I'm rea lly through with, 
what I've done, what I've, what I've completed is only the part where the a one one 
is there. 

But now I've got parts where it's a one two. 

And now if it's a one two that row is used, that column is used. You see that idea? I 
could use this row and column. 

Now that column is used, that column is used, and this guy has to be here, a three 
three. 

And what's that determinant? That's an a one two times an a two one times an a 
three three, and does it have a plus or a minus? A minus is right. 

It has a minus. Because it's one flip away from an id- from the, regular, the right 
order, the diagonal order. And now what's the other guy with a -- with, a one two up 
there? I could have used this row. I could have put this guy here and this guy here. 
Right? You see the whole dea l? Now that's an a one two, a two three, a three one, 
and does that go w ith a plus or a minus? Yeah, now that takes a minute of thinking, 
doesn't it, because one row exchange doesn't get it in line. 

So what is the answer for this? P lus or minus? Plus, because it takes two exchanges. 

I could exchange rows one and three and then two and three. 

Two exchanges makes this thing a plus. OK. And then finally we have -- we're going 
to have two more. Zero zero a one three, a two one zero zero, zero a three two zero. 

And one more guy. Zero zero a one three, zero a two  two zero, A three one zero 
zero. 

And let's put down what we get from those. 

An a one three, an a two one, and an a three two, and  I think that one  is a plus. 

And this guys is a minus because one exchange would put it -- would order it. And 
that's a minus. 

All right, that has taken one whole board just to do the three by three. But do you 
agree that we now have a  formula for the determinant which came from the three 
properties? And it must be it. 

And I'm going to keep that formula. 

That's a famous -- that three by three formula is one that if, if the cameras w ill 
follow me back to  the beg inning here, I, I get the ones w ith the p lus sign are the 
ones that go down like down this way. And the ones with the minus signs are sort of 
the ones that go this way. 

I won't make that precise. For two reasons, one, it would clutter up the board, and 
second reason, it wouldn't be right for four by fours. 

For four by four, let me just say right away, four by four matrix -- the, the cross 
diagonal, the wrong diagonal happens to come out with a plus sign. 

Why is that? If I have a four by four matrix with ones coming on the counter 
diagonal, that determinant is p lus. Why? Why p lus for that guy? Because if I 
exchange rows one and  four and then I exchange rows two and three, I've got the 
identity, and I d id two exchanges. 

So this down to this, like, you know, down toward M iami and down toward LA stuff 
is, like, three by three only. OK. 

But I do want to get now -- I don't want to go through this for a four by four. I do 
want to get now  the genera l formula. So this is what I refer to in the book as the big 
formula. So now this is the b ig formula  for the determinant. I'm asking you to make 
a jump from two by two and three by three to n by n. 

OK, so  this will be the b ig formula. 

That the determinant of A is the sum of a whole  lot of terms. And what are those 
terms? And, and is it a p lus or a minus sign, and I have to tell you which, which it is, 
because this came in -- in the three by three case, I had how many terms? Six. And 
half were p lus and half were minus. How many terms are you figuring for four by 
four? If I get two terms in the two by two case, three -- six terms in the three by 
three case, what's that pattern? How many terms in the four by four case? Twenty-
four. 

Four factoria l. Why four factoria l? This w ill be a sum of n factoria l terms. Twenty-
four, a hundred and twenty, seven hundred and twenty, whatever's after that. 

OK. Half plus and half minus. 

And where do those n  factoria l -- terms come from? This is the moment to listen to 
this lecture. Where do those n factorial terms come from? They come because the 
first, the guy in the first row can be chosen n ways. 

And after he's chosen, that's used up that, that column. So the one in the second 
row can be chosen n minus one ways. And after she's chosen, that second column 
has been used. 

And then the one in the third row can be chosen n minus two ways, and after it's 
chosen -- notice how I'm getting these personal pronouns. But I've run out. 

And I'm not w illing to stop w ith three by three, so I'm just going to write the formula 
down. 

So the one in the first row comes from some column alpha. I don't know what a lpha 
is. And the one in the -- I multip ly that by somebody in the second row that comes 
from some different column. And I multiply that by somebody  in the third row who 
comes from some yet different column. 

And then in the n-th row, I don't know what -- I don't know how to draw. Maybe 
omega, for last. And the whole point is then that -- that those column numbers are 
different, that alpha, beta, gamma, omega, that set of column numbers is some 
permutation, permutation of one to n. It,  it, the n column numbers are each used 
once. And that g ives us n factorial terms. And when I choose a term, that means I'm 
choosing somebody from every row and column. And  then I just -- like the way I had 
this from row and column one, row and column two, row and column three, so that -
- what was the alpha beta stuff in that,  for that term here? Alpha was one, beta was 
two, gamma was three. The permutation was, was the trivia l permutation, one two 
three, everybody in the right order. You see that formula? It's -- do you see why I 
didn't want to start with that the first day, Friday? I'd rather we understood the 
properties. Because out of this formula, presumably I could figure out all these 
properties. How would I know that the determinant of the identity matrix was one, 
for examp le, out of this formula? Why is -- if A is the identity matrix, how does this 
formula give me a plus one? You see it, right? Because, because a lmost a ll the terms 
are zeros. Which term isn't zero, if, if A is the identity matrix? Almost a ll the terms 
are zero because almost all the As are zero. It's only, the only time I'll get something 
is if it's a one one times a two two times a three three. Only, only the, only the 
permutation that's in the right order w ill, will give me something. It'll come with a 
plus sign. 

And the determinant of the identity is one. So, so we could go back from this formula 
and prove everything. We could even try to prove that the determinant of A B was 
the determinant of A times the determinant of B. 

But like next week we would still be working on it, because it's not -- clear from -- if 
I took A B, my God. You know --. 

The entries of A B would be all these pieces. 

Well, probably, it's probably -- historica lly it's been done, but it won't be repeated in 
eighteen oh six. OK. 

It would be possible probably to see, why the determinant of A equals the

determinant of A transpose.


That was another, like, miracle property at the end. That would, that would, that's an

easier one, which we could  find.


OK. Is that a ll right for the big  formula? I could  take you then a, a typical -- let me

do an example.


Which I'll just create. I'll take a four by four matrix. I'll put some, I'll put some ones

in and some zeros in.


OK. Let me -- I don't know how many to put in,  to tell the truth.


I've never done this before. I don't know the determinant of that matrix. So like

mathematics is being done for the first time in, in front of your eyes.


What's the determinant? Well, a lot of -- there are twenty-four terms, because it's

four by four.


Many of them w ill be zero, because I've got a ll those zeros there. Maybe the whole

determinant is zero. I mean, I -- is that a singular matrix? That possibility definitely

exists. I could, I could, So one way to do  it would be elimination.


Actually, that would probably be a fa irly reasonable way.


I could use elimination, so I could use -- go back to those properties, that -- and use

elimination, get down, eliminate it down, do I have a  row of zeros at the end of

elimination? The answer is zero.


I was thinking, shall I try this b ig formula? OK. Let's try the big formula.


How -- tell me one way I can go down the matrix, taking a one, taking a one from

every row and column, and make it to  the end? So it's -- I get something that isn't

zero.


Well, one way to do it, I could take that times that times that times that times that. 

That would be one and, and, and I just said, that comes in w ith what sign? Plus. 

That comes with a p lus sign. Because, because that permutation -- I've just written 
the permutation about four three two one, and one exchange and a second 
exchange, two exchanges puts  it in the correct order. 

Keep wa lking away, don't....


OK, we're executing a determinant formula here. Uh as long as it's not periodic, of

course. If he comes back I'm in -- no.


All right, all right. OK, so  that would give me a p lus one. All right.


Are there any others? Well, of course we see another one here. This times this times

this times this strikes us right away.


So that's the order three, the order -- let me make a little d ifferent mark here. Three

two one four.


And is that a plus or a minus, three two one four? Is that, is that permutation a p lus

or a minus permutation? It's a minus.


How do you see that? What exchange shall I do to get it in the right order? If I 
exchange the one and the three I'm in the right orders,  took one exchange to do  it, 
so that would be a p lus -- that would be a minus one. 

And now I don't know if there're any more here. 

Let's see. Let me try again starting with this. Now I've got to p ick somebody from --

oh yeah, see, you see what's happening.


If I I start there, OK, column three is used.


So then when I go to next row, I can't use that, I must use that. Now columns two

and three are used. When I come to this row  I must use that. And then I must use 
that. 

So if I start there, this is the only one I get.


And similarly, if I start there, that's the only one I get. So what's the determinant?

What's the determinant? Zero.


The determinant is zero for that case.


Because we, we were able to check the twenty-four terms. Twenty-two of them were

zero. One of them was plus one. One of them was minus one.


Add up the twenty-four terms, zero  is the answer.


OK. Well, I d idn't know it would be zero, I -- because I wasn't, like, thinking ahead.


I was a little scared, actua lly.


I said,  that, apparition went by.


So and I don't know if the camera caught that.


So whether the rest of the world w ill realize that I was in danger or not, we don't

know.


But anyway, I guess he just wanted to be sure that we got the right answer, which is

determinant zero.


And then that makes me think, OK, the matrix must be, the matrix must be singular.

And then if the matrix is singular, maybe there's another way to see that it's

singular, like find something in its null space.


Or find a comb ination of the rows that gives zero.


And like what d- what, what comb ination of those rows does g ive zero. Suppose I 
add rows one and rows three. If I add rows one and rows three, what do I get? I get 
a row of all ones. 

Then if I add rows two and rows four I get a row of a ll ones. 

So row one minus row two plus row three minus row four is probably the zero row. 
It's a singular matrix. 

And I could  find something in its null space the same way. 

That would be a comb ination of columns that gives zero. 

OK, there's an examp le. All right. So that's, well, that shows two things. 

That shows how we get the twenty-four terms and it shows the great advantage of 
having a  lot of zeros in there. 

OK. So we'll use this big formula, but I want to pick -- I want to go onward now to 
cofactors. 

Onward to cofactors. Cofactors is a way of breaking up this big  formula that connects 
this n by n -- this is an n by n determinant that we've just have a  formula for, the 
big formula. So cofactors is a way to connect this n by n determinant to, 
determinants one smaller. One smaller. 

And the way we want to do it is actua lly going to show up in this. Since the three by 
three is the one that we wrote out  in full, let's, let me do this three by -- so I'm 
talking about cofactors, and I'm going to start again with three by three. And I'm 
going to take the, the exact formula, and I'm just going to write it as a one one --
this is the determinant I'm writing. 

I'm just going to say a one one times what? A one one times what? And it's a one 
one times a two two a three three minus a two three a  three two. 

Then I've got the a one two stuff times something. 

And I've got the a one three stuff times something. 

Do you see what I'm doing? I'm taking our b ig formula and  I'm saying, OK, choose 
column -- out of the first row, choose column one. 

And take all the possibilities. And those extra factors will be what we'll call the 
cofactor, co meaning going w ith a one one. So this  in parenthesis are, these are in, 
the cofactors are in parens. A one one times something. And I figured out what that 
something was by just looking back -- if I can walk back here to the, to the a one 
one, the one that comes down the diagonal minus the one that comes that way. 

That's, those are the two, only two that used a one one. So there they are, one w ith 
a plus and one with a minus. And now I can write in the -- I could look back and see 
what used a one two and I can see what used a one three, and  those w ill g ive me 
the cofactors of a one two and a one three. 

Before I do that, what's this number, what is this cofactor? What is it there that's 
multip lying a one one? Tell me what a two two a three three minus a two three a 
three two is, for this -- do you recognize that? Do you recognize -- let's see, I can --
and I'll put it here. There's the a one one. 

That's used column one. Then there's -- the other factors involved these other 
columns. 

This row is used. This column is used. 

So this the only things left to use are these. 

And this formula uses them, and what's the, what's the cofactor? Tell me what it is 
because you see it, and then -- I'll be happy you see what the idea of cofactors. It's 
the determinant of this sma ller guy. A one one multip lies the determinant of this 
sma ller guy. That g ives me a ll the a one one part of the big  formula. You see that? 
This, the determinant of this sma ller guy is a two two a three three minus a two 
three a three two. 

In other words, once I've used column one and  row one, what's left is a ll the ways to 
use the other n-1 columns and n-1 rows, one of each. 

All the other -- and that's the determinant of the smaller guy of size n-1. So that's 
the whole idea of cofactors. And we just have to remember that w ith determinants 
we've got pluses and minus signs to keep stra ight. Can we keep this next one 
straight? Let's do the next one. 

OK, the next one will be when I use a one two. 

I'll have left -- so I can't use that column any more, but I can use a two one and a 
two three and I can use a three one and a three three. So this one gave me a one 
times that determinant. This will give me a one two times this determinant, a two 
one a three three minus a two three a  three one. So that's all the stuff involving a 
one two. But have I got the sign right? Is the determinant of that correctly g iven by 
that or is there a minus sign? There is a minus sign. I can follow one of these. If I do 
that times that times that, that was one that's showing up here, but it should have 
showed -- it should have been a minus. 

So I'm going to build that minus sign into the cofactor. So, so the cofactor -- so I'll 
put, put that minus sign in here. So because the cofactor is going to be strictly the 
thing that multip lies the, the factor. The factor is a one two, the cofactor is this, is 
the parens, the stuff in parentheses. So it's got the minus sign built in. And if I did --
if I went on to the third guy, there w- there'll be this and this, this and this. And it 
would take its determinant. It would come out p lus the determinant. So now I'm 
ready to say what cofactors are. So this would be a p lus and a one three times its 
cofactor. And over here we had p lus a one one times this determinant. But and there 
we had the a one two times its cofactor, but the -- so the point  is the cofactor is 
either p lus or minus the determinant. 

So let me write that underneath them. 

What is the, what are cofactors? The cofactor if any number a ij, let's say. 

This is, this is a ll the terms in the, in the b ig formula that involve a ij. 

We're especially interested in a1j, the first row,  that's what I've been ta lking about, 
but any row would be a ll right. All right, so -- what terms involve aij? So -- it's the 
determinant of the n minus one matrix -- with row i, column j erased. So it's the, it's 
a matrix of size n-1 with -- of course, because I can't use this row or this column 
again. 

So I have the matrix all there. But now it's multiplied by a p lus or a minus. This is 
the cofactor, and I'm going to ca ll that cij. Cap ital, I use capital c just to, just to 
emphasize that these are important and emphasize that they're, they're, they're 
different from the (a)s. OK. 

So now is it a plus or is it a minus? Because we see that in this case,  for a one one  it 
was a p lus, for a one two I -- this is ij -- it was a minus. 

For this ij it was a p lus. So any any guess on the rule for plus or minus when we see 
those examp les, ij equal one one or one three was a plus? It sounds very like i+j odd 
or even. 

That, that's doesn't surprise us, and that's the right answer. 

So it's a p lus if i+j is even and it's a minus if i+ j is odd. 

So if I go a long  row one and look at the cofactors, I just take those determinants, 
those one smaller determinants, and  they come  in order plus minus plus minus plus 
minus. But if I go along row two and, and, and take the cofactors of sub-
determinants, they would start w ith a minus, because the two one entry, two p lus 
one  is odd, so the -- like there's a pattern plus minus plus minus p lus if it was five by 
five, but then if I was doing a cofactor then this sign would be minus p lus minus p lus 
minus, p lus minus p lus -- it's sort of checkerboard. OK. 

OK. Those are the signs that, that are g iven by this rule, i+j even or odd. 

And those are built into the cofactors. 

The thing is ca lled a minor w ithout th- before you've built in the sign, but I don't care 
about those. 

Build in that sign and call it a cofactor. OK. So what's the cofactor formula? What's 
the cofactor formula then? Let me come back to this board and say, what's the 
cofactor formula? Determinant of A is -- let's go along the first row. 

It's a one one times its cofactor, and then the second guy is a one two times its 
cofactor, and you just keep going to the end of the row, a1n times its cofactor. 

So that's cofactor for -- along row one. 

And if I went along row I, I would -- those ones would be Is. That's worth putting a 
box over. That's the cofactor formula. 

Do you see that -- actually, this would g ive me another way I could have started the 
whole top ic of determinants. 

And some, some people might do it this -- choose to do it this way. 

Because the cofactor formula would allow me to build up an n by n determinant out 
of n-1 sized determinants, build those out of n-2, and so on. 

I could boil a ll the way down to one by ones. So what's the cofactor formula for two 
by two matrices? Yeah,  tell me that. 

What's the cofactor for us? Here is the, here is the world 's sma llest example, 
practically, of a cofactor formula. OK. 

Let's go along row one. I take this first guy times its cofactor. What's the cofactor of 
the one one entry? d, because you strike out the one one row and column and you're 
left with d. 

Then I take this guy, b, times its cofactor. 

What's the cofactor of b? Is it c or it's -- minus c, because I strike out this guy, I 
take that determinant, and then I follow the i+ j rule and  I get a minus, I get an odd. 
So it's b times minus c. 

OK, it worked. Of course it, it worked. And the three by three works. 

So that's the cofactor formula, and that is, that's an -- that's a good formula  to 
know, and now I'm feeling like, wow, I'm giving you a lot of algebra to swallow here. 
Last lecture gave you ten properties. Now I'm giving you -- and by the way, those 
ten properties led us to a formula  for the determinant which was very important, and 
I haven't repeated it till now. 

What was that? The, the determinant  is the product of the pivots. So the pivot 
formula is, is very important. The p ivots have all this complicated mess already built 
in. 

As you did elimination to get the p ivots, you built in all this horrib le stuff, quite 
efficiently. 

Then the big  formula with the n  factoria l terms, that's got a ll the horrib le stuff spread 
out. 

And the cofactor formula is like in between. 

It's got easy stuff times horrib le stuff, basically. But it's, it shows you, how to get 
determinants from sma ller determinants, and that's the app lication that I now want 
to make. 

So may I do one more examp le? So I remember the general idea. 

But I'm going to use this cofactor formula  for a matrix -- so here is going to be my 
example. 

It's -- I promised in the,  in the lecture, outline at the very beginning to do an 
example. 

And let me do -- I'm going to pick tri-diagonal matrix of ones. I could, I'm draw ing 
here the four by four. So this will be the matrix. 

I could ca ll that A4. But my real idea is to do n by n. To do them all. 

So A -- I could -- everybody understands what A1 and A2 are. 

Yeah. Maybe we should just do A1 and A2 and A3 just for -- so this is A4. 

What's the determinant of A1? What's the determinant of A1? So, so what's the 
matrix A1  in this formula? It's just got that. So the determinant is one. 

What's the determinant of A2? So it's just got this two by two, and its determinant is 
-- zero. 

And then the three by three. Can we see its determinant? Can you take the 
determinant of that three by three? Well, that's not quite so obvious, at least not to 
me. 

Being three by three, I don't know -- so here's a, here's a good example. How would 
you do that three by three determinant? We've got, like, n factorial different ways. 
Well, three factorial. 

So we've got six ways. OK. 

I mean, one way to do it -- actually the way I would probably do it, being three by 
three, I would use the comp lete the big formula. 

I would say, I've got a one from that, I've got a zero from that, I've got a zero from 
that, a zero  from that, and this direction is a minus one, that d irection's a minus one. 
I believe the answer is minus one. 

Would you do it another way? Here's another way to do it, look. Subtract row three 
from -- I'm just looking at this three by three. 

Everybody's looking at the three by three. 

Subtract row three from row  two. 

Determinant doesn't change. So those become zeros. OK, now use the cofactor 
formula. 

How's that? How can, how -- if this was now zeros and I'm looking at this three by 
three, use the cofactor formula. Why not use the cofactor formula along that row? 
Because then I take that number times its cofactor, so I take this number -- let me 
put a box around it -- times its cofactor, which is the determinant of that and that, 
which is what? That two by two matrix has determinant one. 

So what's the cofactor? What's the cofactor of this guy here? Looking just at this 
three by three. The cofactor of that one is this determinant, which is one times 
negative. 

So that's why the answer came out minus one. 

OK. So I did the three by three. 

I don't know  if we want to try the four by four. 

Yeah, let's -- I guess that was the point of my examp le, of course, so I have to try it. 
Sorry, I'm in a good mood today, so you have to stand  for a ll the bad jokes. OK. OK. 

So what was the matrix? Ah. 

OK, now I'm ready for four by four. 

Who wants to -- who wants to guess the,  the -- I don't know, frankly, this four by 
four, what's, what's the determinant. 

I p lan to use cofactors. OK, let's use cofactors. 

The determinant of A4 is -- OK, let's use cofactors on the first row. Those are easy. 
So I multiply this number, which is a convenient one, times this determinant. So  it's, 
it's one times the, this three by three determinant. 

Now what is -- do you recognize that matrix? It's A3. So it's one times the 
determinant of A3. Coming a long this row is a one times this determinant, and it 
goes with a plus, right? And then we have this one. 

And what is its cofactor? Now I'm looking at, now I'm looking at this three by three, 
this three by three, so I'm looking at the three by three that I haven't X-ed out. 

What is that -- oh, now it, we did a p lus or a -- is it plus this determinant, this three 
by three determinant, or minus it? It's minus it, right, because this is -- I'm starting 
in a one two position, and that's a minus. So I want minus this determinant. But 
these guys are X-ed out. 

OK. So I've got a three by three. 

Well, let's use cofactors again. 

Use cofactors of the column, because actually we could use cofactors of columns just 
as well as rows, because, because the transpose rule. So I'll take this one, which is 
now sitting in the p lus position, times its determinant -- oh! Oh, hell. What -- oh 
yeah, I shouldn't have said hell, because it's a ll right. 

OK. One times the determinant. 

What is that matrix now  that I'm taking the, this smaller one of? Oh, but there's a 
minus, right? The minus came from, from the fact that this was in the one two 
position and that's odd. So this is a minus one times -- and what's -- and then this 
one  is the upper left, that's the one one position in  its matrix, so plus. 

And what's this matrix here? Do you recognize that? That matrix is -- yes, please say 
it -- A2. 

And we -- that's our formula  for any case. 

A of any size n is equal to the determinant of A n minus one, that's what came from 
taking the one in the upper corner, the first cofactor, minus the determinant of A n 
minus two. What we discovered there is true for all n. I didn't even mention it, but I 
stopped taking cofactors when I got this one. 

Why did I stop? Why didn't I take the cofactor of this guy? Because he's going to get 
multip lied by zero, and no, no use wasting time. 

Or this one too. The cofactor, her cofactor will be whatever that determinant is, but 
it'll be multip lied by zero, so I won't bother. 

OK, there is the formula. And that now tells us -- I could figure out what A4 is now. 
Oh yeah, finally I can get A4. 

Because it's A3, which is minus one, minus A2, which is zero, so it's minus one. 

You see how we're getting kind of numbers that you might not have guessed. So our 
sequence right now is one zero minus one minus one. What's the next one in the 
sequence, A5? A5 is this minus this, so it is zero. What's A6? A6 is this minus this, 
which is one. 

What's A7? I'm, I'm going to be stopped by either the time runs out or the board 
runs out. 

OK, A7 is this minus this, which is one. 

I'll stop here, because time is out, but let me tell you what we've got. What -- these 
determinants have this series, one zero minus one minus one zero one, and then it 
starts repeating. 

It's pretty fantastic. These determinants have period six. So the determinant of A 
sixty-one would be the determinant of A1, which would be one. OK. 

I hope you liked that example. A non-trivial example of a tri-d iagona l determinant. 
Thanks. 

See you on Wednesday.
