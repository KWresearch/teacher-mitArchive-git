18.06 Linear Algebra, Spring 2010 
Transcript â€“ Lecture 13 

OK. Uh this is the review lecture for the first part of the course, the Ax=b part of the 
course. And the exam will emphasize chapter three. Because those are the --0 
chapter three was about the rectangular matrices where we had null spaces and null 
spaces of A transpose, and  ranks, and a ll the things that are so clear when the 
matrix is square and invertib le, they became things to think about for rectangular 
matrices. So, and vector spaces and subspaces and above a ll those four subspaces. 
OK, I'm thinking to start at least I'll just  look at old exams, read out questions, write 
on the board what I need to and we can see what the answers are. 

The first one I see is one I can just read out. 

Well, I'll write a little. Suppose u, v and w are nonzero vectors  in R^7. What are the 
possible -- they span a -- a vector space. They span a subspace of R^7, and what 
are the possible d imensions? So that's a stra ightforward question, what are the 
possible dimensions of the subspace spanned by u, v and w? OK, one, two, or three, 
right. One, two or three. 

Couldn't be more because we've only got three vectors, and couldn't be zero because 
-- because I told you the vectors were nonzero. Otherw ise if I allowed the possibility 
that those were a ll the zero vector -- then the zero-dimensional subspace would 
have been  in there. OK. 

Now can I jump to a more serious question? OK. We have a five by three matrix. 

And I'm calling it U. I'm saying it's in echelon  form. And it has three pivots, r=3. 
Three pivots. 

OK. F irst question, what's the null space? What's the null space of this matrix U, so 
this matrix is five by three, and I find it helpful to just see visually what five by three 
means, what that shape  is. Three columns. 

Three columns  in U then, five rows, three p ivots, and what's the null space? The null 
space of U is -- and it asks for a spec-of course I'm looking  for an answer that isn't 
just the definition of the null space, but is the null space of this matrix, with this 
information. And what is  it? It's only the zero vector. 

Because we're told that the rank is three, so those three columns must be 
independent, no combination -- of those columns is the zero vector except -- so the 
only thing in this null space is the zero vector, and I -- I could even say what that 
vector is, zero, zero, zero. That's OK. 

So that's what's in the null space. 

All right? let me go on with -- this question has multip le parts. What's the -- oh now 
it asks you about a ten by three matrix, B, which is the matrix U and two U. It 

actually -- I would probab ly be writing R -- and maybe I should be writing R here 
now. 

This exam goes back a few years when I emphasized U more than R . 

Now, what's the echelon form for that matrix? So the echelon form, what's the rank, 
and what's the echelon  form? Let's suppose this is in reduced echelon form, so that I 
could be using the letter R. So I'll ask for the reduced row echelon form so imag ine 
that these are -- U is in reduced  row echelon  form but now I've doub led the height of 
the matrix, what w ill happen when we do row  reduction? What row reduction w ill 
take us to what matrix here? So you start doing elimination. 

You're doing elimination on sing le rows. 

But of course we're a llowed to think of blocks. 

So what, well, what's the answer look  like? U and z- or R -- let's -- I'll stay w ith this 
letter U but I'm rea lly thinking it's in reduced  form, and zero. 

OK. F ine. 

Then it asks oh, further, it asks about this matrix. U, U, U, and zero. 

OK, what's the echelon form of this? So it's just  like practice in thinking through 
what would row elimination, what would  row reduction do. 

Have I thought this through, so what -- what are we -- if we start doing elimination, 
basically we're going to subtract these rows from these -- so it's going to take us to 
U, U, zero, and minus U, I guess, right? Take the thing all the way to R -- let's 
suppose U is really R. Suppose that we're really going for the reduced row echelon 
form. Then would we stop there? No. We would clean out, we would -- we could use 
this to -- is that right, can I so I took this row -- these rows away from these to get 
there. 

Now I take these rows away from these, so that gives me zero. 

There. And now what more would I do if I'm rea lly shooting for R, the reduced  row 
echelon form? I would -- then I want plus ones in the p ivot, so I would multiply 
through by minus one to get plus there. 

So essentially I'm seeing reduced row echelon form there and there, and there's just 
one  little tw ist still to go. Do you see what that final tw ist might be? To have if -- if U 
is in reduced row echelon form and now I'm looking at U, U, there's one little step to 
take, this isn't like a big dea l at all, but -- but if I really want this to be in reduced 
form, what would I still -- might I still have to do? I might have some zero rows 
here, I might have some zero rows here that strictly should move to the bottom. 
Well, I'm not going to make a project out of that. OK. 

What's the rank of that matrix? What's the rank of this matrix C? G iven that I know 
that the origina l U has rank three, what's the rank of this guy? Six, right. That has 
rank six, I can tell. What was -- what's the rank of this B, while -- while we're at it? 
The rank of B, is that six or three? Three is right. Three is right. 

Because we actually got it to where we could just see three pivots. OK, and oh, now 
fina lly this easy one, what's the dimension of the null space -- of the null space of C 
transpose? Oh, boy. 

OK, so what do I -- if I want the dimension of a null space, I want to know the size 
of the matrix -- so what's the size of the matrix C? It looks like it's ten by six, is it? 
Ten by six, so C is ten by six, so m is ten, so C has ten rows, C transpose has ten 
columns, so there are ten columns there. So how many free variables have I got, 
once I -- if I start w ith the ten columns in C transpose, that's the m for the origina l 
C. And what do I subtract off? Six. Because we said that was the rank. So I'm left 
with  four. 

Thanks. OK. 

So I think that's the right answer -- the d imension of the null space of C transpose 
would be four. Right. OK. 

Yeah. OK. 

So that's one question, at least it brought in some -- some of the d imension counts. 
OK. 

Here's another type of question. 

I g ive you an equation, Ax equals two four two. 

And I give you the complete solution. 

But I don't give you the matrix. 

And another -- there's another vector, zero, zero, one. OK. 

All right. My first question is what's the d imension of the row space? Of the matrix A? 
So the ma in thing that you want to get from this question is that a question could 
start this way. 

Sort of backward way. By g iving you the answer and not telling you what the 
problem is. 

But we can get a lot of  information, and sometimes we can get comp lete information 
about that matrix A. 

OK. So what's the dimension of the row space of A? What's the rank? Tell me about 
what's the size of the matrix, yeah, just -- These are the things we want to think 
about, what's the -- what's the shape of the matrix, first of all? It certa inly has three 
rows. But is it a- is it three by three? So the (x)-s that  it multiplies have three 
components, so that --1 does the matrix have three columns a lso? Yes. 

So I'm seeing the same length in b, three, and a lso  in x. 

So A is a three by three matrix. 

And what's its rank? Its rank -- tell me something about its null space, I heard the 
right answer for the rank, the rank is one in this case. 

Why? Because the d imension of the null space, so the dimension of the null space of 
A is from know ing that that's the complete solution, it's two. 

I'm seeing two vectors here, and they're independent in the null space of A, because 
they have to be in the null space of A if I'm a llowed to throw into the solution any 
amount of those vectors, that tells me that's the null space part then. So the 
dimension of the null space is two, and then I -- of course I know the dimensions of 
all the -- four subspaces. 

Now actually it asks what's the matrix? Well, what's the matrix in this case? Do we 
want to -- sha ll I try to  figure that out? Sure. Let's -- you'd like me to do it, OK. So 
what about the matrix, or let me at least start it, OK. 

If A times this x g ives two, four, two, what does that tell me about the matrix A? If A 
times that x solves that equation then it tells me that the first column is -- the first 
column of A is -- one, two, one, right. 

The first column of A has to be one, two, one, because  if I multip ly by x, that's going 
to multiply just the first column, and give me two, four, two. And then I've got two 
more columns to find, and what  information have I got to find them w ith? I've got 
the null space. 

So the fact that this is in the null space, what does that tell me about the matrix? A 
matrix that has zero, zero, one in its null space? That tells me that the last column of 
the matrix is zeroes. Because this is in the null space, the last column has to be 
zeroes. 

And because this is in the null space, what's the second column? Well, this in the null 
space means that if I multiply A by that vector I must be getting zeroes, so I think 
that better be minus one, minus two, and minus one. 

OK. That's a  type of question that just brings out the information that's in that 
complete solution. OK. 

And then actually I go on to ask what vectors -- for what vectors B can Ax=b be 
solved? Ax=b can be solved if what -- so I'm looking  for a cond ition on b, if any. 

Can it be solved for every right-hand side b? No. Definitely not. 

When could it be solved? Well, what's the ---- I actually say in this in the exam, 
don't just tell me. 

If b is in the -- and what would -- what does the exam say there?1 In the column 
space, because I do know  that it can be solved exactly when B is in the column 
space, so I guess I'm asking you what is the column space for this matrix? So what 
is if b has the form -- so I guess I'm asking what's the column space of this matrix, 
and what is it? It's so the column space of that matrix is a ll multiples b -- b is a 
multip le of one, two, one. 

Right? I can solve the thing if  it's a multip le of one, two, one, and of course sure

enough -- yeah, that was a multiple of one, two, one, and so I had a solution.


So this is a case where we've got lots of null space.


Let me just recall rank is big, don't forget those cases, don't forget the other cases

when r is as big as it can be, r equal m or r equal n. Those are -- we had a full

lecture on that, the full rank, full lecture, and important -- important case. OK.


I'll just move on. I think this is the best type of review. It's just brings these ideas

out. Apolog ies to the camera while I recover g lasses and exam. OK.


How about a few true-false ones? Actually there won't be a true-false on the quiz.


But it g ives us a moment of quick review.


Here's one. If the null space -- I have a square matrix. If its null space is just the

zero vector, what about the null space of A transpose? If the null space of A is just

the zero vector, and  the matrix is square, what do I know about the null space of A

transpose? Also the zero vector.


Good. And that's a very very important fact. OK.


How about this? These -- look at the space of five by five matrices as a vector space.


So it's actua lly a twenty-five-d imensiona l vector space. All five by five matrices.


Look at the invertib le matrices.


Do they form a subspace? So I have this five by -- a space of a ll five by five

matrices.


I can add them, I can multip ly by numbers. But now I narrow down to the invertib le

ones. And I ask are they a subspace? And you -- your answer is -- quiet, but

nevertheless definite, no.


Right? No.


Because if I add two invertib le matrices I have no idea if the answer is invertible. If I

multip ly that invertible -- well, it doesn't even have the zero matrix in it, it couldn't 
be a subspace. I have to be able to multiply by zero -- and stay in my subspace, and 
the invertib le ones wouldn't work. 

Well, the singular ones wouldn't work either. 

They have zero -- the zero matrix is in the singular matrices, but if I add two

singular matrices I don't know if the answer is singular or not.


OK. So another true-false.


If b squared equals zero then b equa ls zero.


True or false? If b squared equals zero, true, false? b squared equals zero, b has to 
be a square -- square matrix, so that I can multiply it by itself, does that imply that 
B is zero? Are there matrices whose square could be the zero matrix? Yes or no? Yes 
there are. There are matrices whose square is the zero matrix. So this statement is 
false. 

If b squared is zero, we don't know that b is zero. 

For example -- the best example is that matrix. 

That matrix is a dangerous matrix. 

It will come up in later parts of this course as an example of what can go wrong. And 
here is a  rea l simp le -- so this -- so if I square that matrix, I do get the zero 
matrix,and it shows -- OK. 

A system of m equations in m unknowns is solvable for every right-hand side if the 
columns are independent. OK. So can I say that again, I'm -- I'll write it down then 
for short. m by m matrix independent columns then the question is does Ax=b, is it 
always solvable? And the answer is -- yes or no -- right. 

OK, which -- did you watch that quiz, there was a quiz program on TV  for a  few 
weeks, did you see that, what was the name of that --2 winning a million dollars or 
something? How to be a millionaire? It was some crazy guy, what was his name? It's 
-- Reg is, right. 

Regis. OK.2 If you saw this, like when you should have been doing linear algebra of 
course -- but I d idn't have to do the homework, so I was watching it, so there were 
three -- the interesting -- the novel point was there were three ways that you could 
get help, right -- but you could only use each way once, so you couldn't like use 
them all the time. So remember that? You could -- so you could poll the aud ience, 
and that was a very -- that was a hundred percent successful way, so I'll poll the 
audience on this. 

If the other possib ility -- another possibility you could ca ll your friend, right, or he's 
your friend until he gives you the wrong answer, which -- that turned out to be very 
unreliab le, you know, you'd ca ll up your brother or something and ask him for the 
capital of whatever, Bosnia. What does he know, he makes some guess, matrix, 
independent columns,  is Ax=b always solvab le? Maybe just hands up for that? A few. 
And who says no? Oh, gosh, this audience is not reliab le. 

Fifty fifty. I guess I'd say, I'd vote yes. Because  independent columns, that means 
that the rank is the full size m, I have a matrix of rank m. That means it's -- I mean 
it's square, so it's an invertible matrix, and nothing could go wrong. Yes. 

So that's the good case and we always expect it in chapter two, but of course 
chapter three is -- only one of the possib ilities. OK. 

Let me move on to another question from an old quiz. 

OK. OK. 

Let's see. OK. 

I'm going to give you a matrix, but I'm going to give it to you as a product of a 
coup le of matrices, one, one, zero, zero, one, zero, one, zero, one, times another 
matrix, one, zero, minus one, two, zero, one, one, minus one, and all zeroes. OK. 

I would like to ask you questions about that matrix without doing the multiplication 
and find ing the matrix b. 

Can you tell me something -- so I'll ask questions about this matrix b and I'll answer 
them without multiplying it out.2 For example, I'm going to ask you for a basis for 
the null space. A basis for the null space. So I'm going to solve Bx equa ls zero. 

So g ive me a basis for -- for the null space of B. 

Let's see, what dimension I in -- the null space of B is a subspace of R. What size 
vectors I looking for here? Because if we don't know the size, we aren't going to  find 
it, right? the null -- this matrix is three by four obviously. 

So if we're looking for the null space we're looking for those vectors x in R^4. OK. 

So the null space of B is certainly a subspace of R^4. 

What do you think its dimension  is? Of course once we find the basis we would know 
the d imension immediately, but let's stop first, what's the rank of this matrix B? Let's 
see, what -- is that matrix invertib le, that square one there? Let's say sure, I think it 
is, yes, that matrix B looks invertib le. Is that pretty clear? Yeah. Yeah. 

So I've gone wrong in this course already, but I'll still hope that that matrix is 
invertible. 

Yeah, yeah, because if I look for a combination of those three columns -- well, I 
couldn't use this midd le column because it would have a one and in a position that I 
-- column is otherw ise all zero, so a combination that gives zero can't g ive us that 
problem, and then the other two are clearly independent sets -- so that matrix  is 
invertible. 

Later we could take a determinant or other things. 

OK. What's the setup? If I have an invertib le matrix, a nice invertible square matrix, 
times this guy, times this second factor, and  I'm looking for the null space, does this 
have any effect? Is the null -- so what I'm asking is is the null space of B the same 
as the null space of just this part? I think so. 

I think so. If Bx is zero, then multiplying by that guy I'll still have zero. But also if 
this times some x g ive zero, I could always multiply on the left by the  inverse of 
that, because it is invertib le, and I would d iscover that this kind of Bx is zero. You 
want me to write some of that down -- if I have a product here, C  times -- times D, 
say, and if C is invertib le, the null space of CD, well, it w ill the same as the null 
space of D. If C is invertible. 

Multiplying by an invertib le matrix on the left can't change the null space. OK. 

So basica lly I'm asking you  for the null space of this. 

I don't have to do the multip lication because I have C is invertible. That first factor C 
is invertible. It's not going to change the null space. OK. So can we just write down a 
basis now for the null space? So what's the basis for the null space of -- of that? So 
basis for the null space I'm looking  for the two -- there are two pivot columns 
obviously. It clearly has rank two. I'm looking for the two special solutions. 

They'll come from the third and the fourth. 

The free variables. OK. 

so if the third free variable is a one, then I think probably I need a minus one there 
and a one there, it looks like. 

Do you agree that if I then do that multip lication I'll get zero? And if I have one in 
the fourth variable, then maybe I need a one in the second variable and maybe a 
minus two in the third. So I just reasoned that through and then if I look back I see 
sure enough that the free variable part that I sometimes call F, that up -- that two 
by two corner, is sitting here with all its signs reversed. So that's -- here I'm seeing 
minus F, and here I'm seeing the identity in the null space matrix. OK, so that's the 
null space. 

Another question  is solve Bx equa l one, zero, one. OK. 

So that's one question, now solve complete solutions. 

To Bx equal one, zero, one. 

OK. Yeah, so I guess I'm seeing if I wanted to get one, zero, one - What's our 
particular solution? So I'm looking for a particular solution and then the null space 
part. 

OK. I-- actually the first column of B, so what's the first column of our matrix B? It's 
the vector one, zero, one. The first column of our matrix agrees with the right-hand 
side. 

So I guess I'm thinking x particular p lus x null space w ill be the particular solution, 
since the first column of B is exactly right, that's great. And then I have C times that 
first null space vector and D times the other null space vector. 

Right? The two -- the null space part of the solution, as always has the arbitrary 
constants, the particular solution doesn't have any arb itrary constants, it's one 
particular solution, and in this case it'll -- that one would do. 

OK. F ine. 

so those are questions taken from old quizzes, any questions coming to mind? Yeah. 

Q: value. OK. 

Well, so that particular x particular, it says that let's see, when I multiply by this 
guy, I'm going to get the first column of B. That -- if that's a solution, I multiply B, B 
times this x w ill be the first column of B, and so I'm saying that the first column of 

this B agrees with the right-hand side. So I'm saying that look at the first column of 
that matrix B. If you do the multiplication, it's -- so what's the first column of that 
matrix? Is that how you do that multip lication? I multiply that matrix by that first 
column. 

And it picks out one, zero, one.


So the first column of B is exactly that.


And therefore a particular solution will be this guy.


Yeah. OK. Yes. Q: particular solution.


Any of the solutions can be the particular one that we pick out.


So like this plus -- plus this would be another particular solution. It would be another

solution.


The particular is just telling us only take one. But it's not telling us which one we

have to take.


We take the most convenient one.


I guess in this -- in this problem that was that one.


Good. Other questions? Yes. And this pattern of particular plus null space, of course,

that's going throughout mathematics of linear systems.


We're really doing mathematics of linear systems here.


Our systems are discrete and they're finite-dimensiona l -- and so it's linear a lgebra,

but this particular p lus null space goes -- that doesn't depend on having finite

matrices -- that spreads much -- that spreads everywhere.


OK, I'm going to just like to encourage you to take prob lems out of the book, let me

do the same myself.


OK well here's some easy true or fa lses.


I don't know why the author put these  in here.


OK. If m=n, then the row space equals the column space. So these are true or

falses. 

If m equa ls n, so that means the matrix is square, then the row space equa ls the 
column space? False, good. Good, what is equal there? What can I say  is equa l, if M 
-- well, yeah. Yeah it -- so that's definitely false -- the row space and the column 
space, and this matrix is like always a good example to consider. So there's a square 
matrix but it's row space is the multiples of zero, one, and its column space is the 
multip les of one, zero. Very different. 

The row space and the column space are totally different for that matrix. Now of 
course if the matrix was symmetric, well,  then clearly the row space equals the 
column space. OK. 

How about this question? The matrices A and minus A share the same four 
subspaces? Do the matrices A and minus A have the same column space, do they 
have the same null space, do they have the same row space? What's the answer on 
that? Yes or no. 

Yes. Good. 

OK. How about this? If A and B have the same four subspaces, then A is a multip le of 
B. If -- suppose those subspaces are the same. Then is A a multiple of B? OK. How 
how do you answer a question like that? Of course if you want to answer it yes, then 
I would -- then they'd have to think of a  reason why. If you want to answer no way, 
then you would -- and I would sort of like first I would try to think no, I would say 
can I come up with an example where it isn't true? Let me repeat the question. 

And then write the answer. OK. 

So I'll repeat that question. If -- so true or fa lse, if A and B have the same four 
subspaces, then A is some multip le of B. True or fa lse, how do you feel about it at 
this instant?3 There's quite a few trues, shall I take a poll, so how many think true? 
OK. 

I gave you every chance to think about that. 

Let's see. So what -- I would just take extreme cases if it was me, so when do I 
know -- well, I would say suppose the matrix is invertib le -- suppose A is an 
invertible matrix, then what -- suppose it's six by six invertible matrix,  then what's 
its row space, and its column space is a ll of R^6, and the null space, and the null 
space of A transpose would be the zero vector. So every invertible matrix is going to 
give that answer. If I have a six by six invertib le matrix, I know what those 
subspaces are. Heck, that was back in chapter two, when I didn't even know what 
subspaces were. 

The row space and column space are both a ll six-dimensional space -- the whole 
space, and the rank is six,  in other words, and the null spaces have zero dimension. 

So do you see now the answer? So A and B could be. 

So A and B could be for example any -- so I'm going to say false. Because A and B 
for examp le -- So an examp le: A and B any invertible six by six, six by six. So those 
would have the same four subspaces but they wouldn't be the same. 

Of course th- there should be something about those matrices that would be the 
same. It's sort of a natura l prob lem, so now actually we're getting to a math 
question. 

The answer is this is not true. One matrix doesn't have to be a multip le of the other. 
But there must be something that's true. And that would be sort of like a natura l 
question to ask. If they have the same subspaces, same four subspaces, then what -
- what could you -- instinct wasn't necessarily right. 

But I hope you now see that the correct answer is fa lse. 

And then you might think OK, well, they certainly do have the same rank. But do --
obviously if they have the same four subspaces, they have the same rank. 

I might say if they have the well, I could extend that question and think about other 
possibilities and finally come up with something that was true. But I won't press that 
one. 

Let me keep going with practice questions. 

And these practice questions are quite appropriate I think for the exam. OK. 

let's see. If I exchange two rows of A which subspaces stay the same? So I'm trying 
to take out questions that we can answer without you know we can answer quickly. 
If I have a matrix A, and I exchange two of its rows, which subspaces stay the 
same? The row space does stay the same. 

And the null space stays the same. 

Good. Good. 

Correct. Column space would be a wrong answer. OK. 

all right, here's a question. Oh, this leads into the next chapter. Why can the vector 
one, two, three not be a row and a lso in the null space? F itting we close with this 
question. 

Close is -- so V equa l this one, two, three can't be in the null space of a matrix and 
the row space. And my question is why not? Why not? So  this is a question that we 
can because it's sort of asked in a stra ightforward way, we can figure out an answer. 
Well, actua lly yeah -- I'll even pin it down, it can't be in the null space -- and be a 
row. I'll even p in it down further. 

Ask it to be a row of A. Why not? So I'm -- we know the dimensions of these spaces. 

But now I'm asking you sort of like the overlap between -- so the null space and the 
row space, those are in the same n-dimensional space. Those are -- well, those are 
both subspaces of n-dimensional space, and  I'm basica lly saying they can't overlap. 

I can't have a vector like this, a typ ical vector, that's in the null space and  it's also a 
row of the matrix. 

Why is that? So that's a new sort of idea. 

Let's just see what it would mean. 

I mean that A times this V, why can this A times this V it can't be zero. Oh well, if it's 
zero, so this is -- I'm getting it into the null space here. 

So this is -- now let's put that vector's in the null space, why can't the first row of a 
matrix be one, two, three? I can fill out the matrix as I like. Why is that impossible? 

Well, you're seeing it's impossible, right? That if that was a  row of the matrix and  in 
the null space, that number would not be zero, it would be fourteen. 

Right. So now we actually are beginning to get a more comp lete p icture of these four 
subspaces. 

The two that are over in n-dimensional space, they actually only share the zero 
vector. 

The intersection of the null space and the row space  is only the zero vector. And in 
fact the null space is perpend icular to the row space. That'll be the first top ic let's 
see, we have a holiday Monday -- and I'll see you Wednesday w ith perpendiculars. 
And I'll see you Friday. So good luck on the quiz.
