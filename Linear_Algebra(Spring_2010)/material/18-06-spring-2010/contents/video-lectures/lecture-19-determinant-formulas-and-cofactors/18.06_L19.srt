1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:05
OK, this is the second lecture
on determinants.

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:08
There are only three.

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:15
With determinants it's a
fascinating, small topic inside

4
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
linear algebra.

5
00:00:17 --> 00:00:23
Used to be determinants were
the big thing,

6
00:00:23 --> 00:00:28
and linear algebra was the
little thing,

7
00:00:28 --> 00:00:32
but they --
those changed,

8
00:00:32 --> 00:00:34
that situation changed.

9
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
Now determinants is one
specific part,

10
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
very neat little part.

11
00:00:39 --> 00:00:45
And my goal today is to find a
formula for the determinant.

12
00:00:45 --> 00:00:47
It'll be a messy formula.

13
00:00:47 --> 00:00:51
So that's why you didn't see it
right away.

14
00:00:51 --> 00:00:55
But if I'm given this n by n
matrix

15
00:00:55 --> 00:00:58
then I use those entries to
create this number,

16
00:00:58 --> 00:00:59
the determinant.

17
00:00:59 --> 00:01:01
So there's a formula for it.

18
00:01:01 --> 00:01:05
In fact, there's another
formula, a second formula using

19
00:01:05 --> 00:01:07
something called cofactors.

20
00:01:07 --> 00:01:10
So you'll -- you have to know
what cofactors are.

21
00:01:10 --> 00:01:13
And then I'll apply those
formulas for some,

22
00:01:13 --> 00:01:18
some matrices that have a
lot of zeros away from the

23
00:01:18 --> 00:01:20
three diagonals.

24
00:01:20 --> 00:01:20
OK.

25
00:01:20 --> 00:01:25
So I'm shooting now for a
formula for the determinant.

26
00:01:25 --> 00:01:30
You remember we started with
these three properties,

27
00:01:30 --> 00:01:35
three simple properties,
but out of that we got all

28
00:01:35 --> 00:01:40
these amazing facts,
like the determinant of A B

29
00:01:40 --> 00:01:44
equals determinant of A times
determinant of B.

30
00:01:44 --> 00:01:49
But the three facts were -- oh,
how about I just take two by

31
00:01:49 --> 00:01:50
twos.

32
00:01:50 --> 00:01:55.16
I know, because everybody here
knows, the determinant of a two

33
00:01:55.16 --> 00:01:59.11
by two matrix,
but let's get it out of

34
00:01:59.11 --> 00:02:01
these three formulas.

35
00:02:01 --> 00:02:05
OK, so here's my,
my two by two matrix.

36
00:02:05 --> 00:02:09.8
I'm looking for a formula for
this determinant.

37
00:02:09.8 --> 00:02:11
a b c d, OK.

38
00:02:11 --> 00:02:15
So property one,
I know what to do with the

39
00:02:15 --> 00:02:16
identity.

40
00:02:16 --> 00:02:16
Right?

41
00:02:16 --> 00:02:21
Property two allows me to
exchange

42
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
rows, and I know what to do
then.

43
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
So I know that that determinant
is one.

44
00:02:27 --> 00:02:32
Property two allows me to
exchange rows and know that this

45
00:02:32 --> 00:02:35
determinant is minus one.

46
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
And now I want to use property
three to get everybody,

47
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
to get everybody.

48
00:02:41 --> 00:02:43
And how will I do that?

49
00:02:43 --> 00:02:44
OK.

50
00:02:44 --> 00:02:50
So remember that if I keep the
second row the same,

51
00:02:50 --> 00:02:55
I'm allowed to use linearity in
the first row.

52
00:02:55 --> 00:02:59
And I'll just use it in a
simple way.

53
00:02:59 --> 00:03:04
I'll write this vector a b as a
0 + 0 b.

54
00:03:04 --> 00:03:08
So that's one step using
property three,

55
00:03:08 --> 00:03:15
linearity in the first row
when the second row's the same.

56
00:03:15 --> 00:03:15.59
OK.

57
00:03:15.59 --> 00:03:19.22
But now you can guess what I'm
going to do next.

58
00:03:19.22 --> 00:03:23
I'll -- because I'd like to --
if I can make the matrices

59
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
diagonal, then I'm clearly
there.

60
00:03:26 --> 00:03:27
So I'll take this one.

61
00:03:27 --> 00:03:33
Now I'll keep the first row
fixed and split the second row,

62
00:03:33 --> 00:03:38
so that'll be an a 0 and I'll
split that into a c 0 and,

63
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
keeping that first row the
same, a 0 d.

64
00:03:41 --> 00:03:44
I used, for this part,
linearity.

65
00:03:44 --> 00:03:49
And now I'll -- whoops,
that's plus because I've got

66
00:03:49 --> 00:03:50
more coming.

67
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
This one I'll do the same.

68
00:03:52 --> 00:03:56
I'll keep this first row the
same

69
00:03:56 --> 00:04:00
and I'll split c d into c 0 and
0 d.

70
00:04:00 --> 00:04:00
OK.

71
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
Now I've got four easy
determinants,

72
00:04:03 --> 00:04:09
and two of them are -- well,
all four are extremely easy.

73
00:04:09 --> 00:04:13
Two of them are so easy as to
turn into zero,

74
00:04:13 --> 00:04:14
right?

75
00:04:14 --> 00:04:20
Which two of these determinants
are zero right away?

76
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
The first guy is zero.

77
00:04:22 --> 00:04:23.54
Why is he zero?

78
00:04:23.54 --> 00:04:27
Why is that determinant
nothing, forget him?

79
00:04:27 --> 00:04:30
Well, it has a column of zeros.

80
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
And by the -- well,
so one way to think is,

81
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
well, it's a singular matrix.

82
00:04:36 --> 00:04:40
Oh, for, for like forty-eight
different reasons,

83
00:04:40 --> 00:04:43
that
determinant is zero.

84
00:04:43 --> 00:04:46
It's a singular matrix that has
a column of zeros.

85
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
It's, it's dead.

86
00:04:48 --> 00:04:50.51
And this one is about as dead
too.

87
00:04:50.51 --> 00:04:51
Column of zeros.

88
00:04:51 --> 00:04:51
OK.

89
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
So that's leaving us with this
one.

90
00:04:54 --> 00:04:58
Now what do I -- how do I know
its determinant,

91
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00.44
following the rules?

92
00:05:00.44 --> 00:05:05
Well, I guess one of the
properties that we actually got

93
00:05:05 --> 00:05:09
to was the determinant of that
-- diagonal matrix,

94
00:05:09 --> 00:05:13
then -- so I,
I'm finally getting to that

95
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
determinant is the a d.

96
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
And this determinant is what?

97
00:05:18 --> 00:05:19
What's this one?

98
00:05:19 --> 00:05:26
Minus -- because I would use
property two to do a flip to

99
00:05:26 --> 00:05:30
make it c b, then property three
to factor out the b,

100
00:05:30 --> 00:05:36
property c to factor out the c
-- the property again to factor

101
00:05:36 --> 00:05:41
out the c, and that minus,
and of course finally I got the

102
00:05:41 --> 00:05:44
answer that we knew we would
get.

103
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
But you see the method.

104
00:05:47 --> 00:05:51
You see the method,
because it's method I'm looking

105
00:05:51 --> 00:05:56
for here, not just a two by two
answer but the method of doing

106
00:05:56 --> 00:06:01
-- now I can do three by threes
and four by fours and any size.

107
00:06:01 --> 00:06:06.85
So if you can see the method of
taking each row at a time -- so

108
00:06:06.85 --> 00:06:11
let's -- what would happen with
three by threes?

109
00:06:11 --> 00:06:15
Can we mentally do it rather
than I write everything on the

110
00:06:15 --> 00:06:17
board for three by threes?

111
00:06:17 --> 00:06:21
So what would we do if I had
three by threes?

112
00:06:21 --> 00:06:25
I would keep rows two and three
the same and I would split the

113
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
first row into how many pieces?

114
00:06:28 --> 00:06:29
Three pieces.

115
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
I'd have an A zero zero and a
zero B

116
00:06:32 --> 00:06:38
zero and a zero zero C or
something for the first row.

117
00:06:38 --> 00:06:44
So I would instead of going
from one piece to two pieces to

118
00:06:44 --> 00:06:50
four pieces, I would go from one
piece to three pieces to -- what

119
00:06:50 --> 00:06:51
would it be?

120
00:06:51 --> 00:06:56
Each of those three,
would, would it be nine?

121
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58.09
Or twenty-seven?

122
00:06:58.09 --> 00:07:02
Oh yeah, I've actually
got more steps,

123
00:07:02 --> 00:07:02
right.

124
00:07:02 --> 00:07:06
I'd go to nine but then I'd
have another row to straighten

125
00:07:06 --> 00:07:07
out, twenty-seven.

126
00:07:07 --> 00:07:07
Yes, oh God.

127
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
OK, let me say this again then.

128
00:07:09 --> 00:07:13
If I -- if it was three by
three, I would -- separating out

129
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
one row into three pieces would
give me three,

130
00:07:15 --> 00:07:19
separating out the second row
into three pieces,

131
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
then I'd be up to nine,
separating out the third row

132
00:07:23 --> 00:07:27.57
into its three pieces,
I'd be up to twenty-seven,

133
00:07:27.57 --> 00:07:29
three cubed,
pieces.

134
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
But a lot of them would be
zero.

135
00:07:31 --> 00:07:34
So now when would they not be
zero?

136
00:07:34 --> 00:07:38.6
Tell me the pieces that would
not be zero.

137
00:07:38.6 --> 00:07:42.39
Now I will write the non-zero
ones.

138
00:07:42.39 --> 00:07:45
OK, so I have this matrix.

139
00:07:45 --> 00:07:51
I think I have to use these,
start using these double

140
00:07:51 --> 00:07:57
symbols here because otherwise I
could never do n by n.

141
00:07:57 --> 00:07:57
OK.

142
00:07:57 --> 00:07:57
OK.

143
00:07:57 --> 00:08:01
So I split this up like crazy.

144
00:08:01 --> 00:08:05
A bunch of pieces are zero.

145
00:08:05 --> 00:08:09
Whenever I have a column of
zeros, I know I've got zero.

146
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
When do I not have zero?

147
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14.97
When do I have -- what is it
that's like these guys?

148
00:08:14.97 --> 00:08:18
These are the survivors,
two survivors there.

149
00:08:18 --> 00:08:22
So my question for three by
three is going to be what are

150
00:08:22 --> 00:08:23
the survivors?

151
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
How many survivors are there?

152
00:08:26 --> 00:08:27
What are they?

153
00:08:27 --> 00:08:30
And when do I get a survivor.

154
00:08:30 --> 00:08:35
Well, I would get a survivor --
for example, one survivor will

155
00:08:35 --> 00:08:41
be that one times that one times
that one, with all zeros

156
00:08:41 --> 00:08:42
everywhere else.

157
00:08:42 --> 00:08:47.69
That would be one survivor.
a one one zero zero zero a two

158
00:08:47.69 --> 00:08:50.62
two zero zero zero a three
three.

159
00:08:50.62 --> 00:08:54
That's like the a d survivor.

160
00:08:54 --> 00:08:56
Tell me another survivor.

161
00:08:56 --> 00:09:01
What other thing -- oh,
now here you see the clue.

162
00:09:01 --> 00:09:05
Now can -- shall I just say the
whole clue?

163
00:09:05 --> 00:09:10
That I'm having -- the
survivors have one entry from

164
00:09:10 --> 00:09:12.91
each row and each column.

165
00:09:12.91 --> 00:09:16
One entry from each row and
column.

166
00:09:16 --> 00:09:20
Because if some column is
missing,

167
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
then I get a singular matrix.

168
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
And that, that's one of these
guys.

169
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
See, you see what happened with
-- this guy?

170
00:09:29 --> 00:09:32
Column one never got used in 0
b 0 d.

171
00:09:32 --> 00:09:36
So its determinant was zero and
I forget it.

172
00:09:36 --> 00:09:40.39
So I'm going to forget those
and

173
00:09:40.39 --> 00:09:45
just put -- so tell me one more
that would be a survivor?

174
00:09:45 --> 00:09:48.58
Well -- well,
here's another one.

175
00:09:48.58 --> 00:09:54
a one one zero zero -- now OK,
that's used up row -- row one

176
00:09:54 --> 00:09:54
is used.

177
00:09:54 --> 00:10:00
Column one is already used so
it better be zero.

178
00:10:00 --> 00:10:01
What else could I have?

179
00:10:01 --> 00:10:06
Where could I pick the guy --
which column shall I use in row

180
00:10:06 --> 00:10:06
two?

181
00:10:06 --> 00:10:10
Use column three,
because here if I use column --

182
00:10:10 --> 00:10:13
here I used column one and row
one.

183
00:10:13 --> 00:10:17
This was like the column --
numbers were one two three,

184
00:10:17 --> 00:10:19
right in order.

185
00:10:19 --> 00:10:22
Now the column numbers are
going to

186
00:10:22 --> 00:10:25
be one three,
column three,

187
00:10:25 --> 00:10:26
and column two.

188
00:10:26 --> 00:10:31
So the row numbers are one two
three, of course.

189
00:10:31 --> 00:10:36
The column numbers are some --
OK, some permutation of one two

190
00:10:36 --> 00:10:41
three, and here they come in the
order one three two.

191
00:10:41 --> 00:10:47.34
It's just like having a
permutation matrix with,

192
00:10:47.34 --> 00:10:49
instead of the ones,
with numbers.

193
00:10:49 --> 00:10:52
And actually,
it's very close to having a

194
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
permutation matrix,
because I, what I do eventually

195
00:10:55 --> 00:10:59
is I factor out these numbers
and then I have got.

196
00:10:59 --> 00:11:01
So what is that determinant
equal?

197
00:11:01 --> 00:11:04
I factor those numbers out and
I've

198
00:11:04 --> 00:11:08
got a one one times a two two
times a three three.

199
00:11:08 --> 00:11:11
And what does this determinant
equal?

200
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
Yeah, now tell me the,
this -- I mean,

201
00:11:14 --> 00:11:18
we're really getting to the
heart of these formulas now.

202
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
What is that determinant?

203
00:11:20 --> 00:11:24
By the laws of -- by,
by our three properties,

204
00:11:24 --> 00:11:28
I can factor these out,
I can factor out the a one one,

205
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
the a two three,
and the a three two.

206
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
They're in separate rows.

207
00:11:34 --> 00:11:36.54
I can do each row separately.

208
00:11:36.54 --> 00:11:41
And then I just have to decide
is that plus sign or is that a

209
00:11:41 --> 00:11:42.59
minus sign?

210
00:11:42.59 --> 00:11:45
And the answer is it's a minus.

211
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47.02
Why minus?

212
00:11:47.02 --> 00:11:52
Because these is one row
exchange to get it back to the

213
00:11:52 --> 00:11:53
identity.

214
00:11:53 --> 00:11:54
So that's a minus.

215
00:11:54 --> 00:11:56
Now I through?

216
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59.53
No, because there are other
ways.

217
00:11:59.53 --> 00:12:03
What I'm really through with,
what I've done,

218
00:12:03 --> 00:12:09
what I've, what I've completed
is only the part where the a one

219
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
one is there.

220
00:12:11 --> 00:12:16
But now I've got parts
where it's a one two.

221
00:12:16 --> 00:12:21
And now if it's a one two that
row is used, that column is

222
00:12:21 --> 00:12:21
used.

223
00:12:21 --> 00:12:23
You see that idea?

224
00:12:23 --> 00:12:26
I could use this row and
column.

225
00:12:26 --> 00:12:29
Now that column is used,
that column is used,

226
00:12:29 --> 00:12:33
and this guy has to be here,
a three three.

227
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
And what's that determinant?

228
00:12:36 --> 00:12:41
That's an a one two times an a
two one times an a three three,

229
00:12:41 --> 00:12:44
and does it have a plus or a
minus?

230
00:12:44 --> 00:12:45
A minus is right.

231
00:12:45 --> 00:12:46.68
It has a minus.

232
00:12:46.68 --> 00:12:50
Because it's one flip away from
an id- from the,

233
00:12:50 --> 00:12:53
regular, the right order,
the diagonal order.

234
00:12:53 --> 00:12:57
And now what's the other guy
with a --

235
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
with, a one two up there?

236
00:13:00 --> 00:13:02
I could have used this row.

237
00:13:02 --> 00:13:07
I could have put this guy here
and this guy here.

238
00:13:07 --> 00:13:08
Right?

239
00:13:08 --> 00:13:10
You see the whole deal?

240
00:13:10 --> 00:13:14
Now that's an a one two,
a two three,

241
00:13:14 --> 00:13:18
a three one,
and does that go with a plus or

242
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
a minus?

243
00:13:20 --> 00:13:24
Yeah, now that takes a minute
of thinking, doesn't it,

244
00:13:24 --> 00:13:28
because one row exchange
doesn't get it in line.

245
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
So what is the answer for this?

246
00:13:30 --> 00:13:31
Plus or minus?

247
00:13:31 --> 00:13:34
Plus, because it takes two
exchanges.

248
00:13:34 --> 00:13:39
I could exchange rows one and
three and then two and three.

249
00:13:39 --> 00:13:43.63
Two exchanges makes this thing
a plus.

250
00:13:43.63 --> 00:13:43
OK.

251
00:13:43 --> 00:13:50
And then finally we have --
we're going to have two more.

252
00:13:50 --> 00:13:54
Zero zero a one three,
a two one zero zero,

253
00:13:54 --> 00:13:57
zero a three two zero.

254
00:13:57 --> 00:13:59.32
And one more guy.

255
00:13:59.32 --> 00:14:04
Zero zero a one three,
zero a two two zero,

256
00:14:04 --> 00:14:07
A three one zero zero.

257
00:14:07 --> 00:14:11
And let's put down what we get
from those.

258
00:14:11 --> 00:14:13
An a one three,
an a two one,

259
00:14:13 --> 00:14:18
and an a three two,
and I think that one is a plus.

260
00:14:18 --> 00:14:24
And this guys is a minus
because one exchange would put

261
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
it -- would order it.

262
00:14:27 --> 00:14:29
And that's a minus.

263
00:14:29 --> 00:14:36
All right, that has taken one
whole board just to do the three

264
00:14:36 --> 00:14:37
by three.

265
00:14:37 --> 00:14:43
But do you agree that we now
have a formula for the

266
00:14:43 --> 00:14:49
determinant which came from the
three properties?

267
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
And it must be it.

268
00:14:51 --> 00:14:55
And I'm going to keep that
formula.

269
00:14:55 --> 00:15:01
That's a famous --
that three by three formula is

270
00:15:01 --> 00:15:05.86
one that if, if the cameras will
follow me back to the beginning

271
00:15:05.86 --> 00:15:10
here, I, I get the ones with the
plus sign are the ones that go

272
00:15:10 --> 00:15:12
down like down this way.

273
00:15:12 --> 00:15:16
And the ones with the minus
signs are sort of the ones that

274
00:15:16 --> 00:15:17
go this way.

275
00:15:17 --> 00:15:20
I won't make that precise.

276
00:15:20 --> 00:15:23
For two reasons,
one, it would clutter up the

277
00:15:23 --> 00:15:28
board, and second reason,
it wouldn't be right for four

278
00:15:28 --> 00:15:28
by fours.

279
00:15:28 --> 00:15:32
For four by four,
let me just say right away,

280
00:15:32 --> 00:15:35
four by four matrix -- the,
the cross diagonal,

281
00:15:35 --> 00:15:41
the wrong diagonal happens to
come out with a plus sign.

282
00:15:41 --> 00:15:42
Why is that?

283
00:15:42 --> 00:15:48
If I have a four by four matrix
with ones coming on the counter

284
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
diagonal, that determinant is
plus.

285
00:15:52 --> 00:15:52
Why?

286
00:15:52 --> 00:15:55
Why plus for that guy?

287
00:15:55 --> 00:16:01.08
Because if I exchange rows one
and four and then I exchange

288
00:16:01.08 --> 00:16:06
rows two and three,
I've got the identity,

289
00:16:06 --> 00:16:09
and I did two exchanges.

290
00:16:09 --> 00:16:13
So this down to this,
like, you know,

291
00:16:13 --> 00:16:18
down toward Miami and down
toward LA stuff is,

292
00:16:18 --> 00:16:22
like, three by three only.

293
00:16:22 --> 00:16:22
OK.

294
00:16:22 --> 00:16:29
But I do want to get now -- I
don't want to go through this

295
00:16:29 --> 00:16:31
for a four by four.

296
00:16:31 --> 00:16:37
I do want to get now
the general formula.

297
00:16:37 --> 00:16:43.79
So this is what I refer to in
the book as the big formula.

298
00:16:43.79 --> 00:16:49
So now this is the big formula
for the determinant.

299
00:16:49 --> 00:16:55.74
I'm asking you to make a jump
from two by two and three by

300
00:16:55.74 --> 00:16:57
three to n by n.

301
00:16:57 --> 00:17:01
OK, so this will be the big
formula.

302
00:17:01 --> 00:17:06
That the determinant of A is
the sum

303
00:17:06 --> 00:17:08.75
of a whole lot of terms.

304
00:17:08.75 --> 00:17:10.9
And what are those terms?

305
00:17:10.9 --> 00:17:15
And, and is it a plus or a
minus sign, and I have to tell

306
00:17:15 --> 00:17:20
you which, which it is,
because this came in -- in the

307
00:17:20 --> 00:17:23
three by three case,
I had how many terms?

308
00:17:23 --> 00:17:24
Six.

309
00:17:24 --> 00:17:28
And half were plus and half
were minus.

310
00:17:28 --> 00:17:33
How many terms are you figuring
for four by four?

311
00:17:33 --> 00:17:40
If I get two terms in the two
by two case, three -- six terms

312
00:17:40 --> 00:17:46
in the three by three case,
what's that pattern?

313
00:17:46 --> 00:17:50
How many terms in the four by
four case?

314
00:17:50 --> 00:17:51
Twenty-four.

315
00:17:51 --> 00:17:54
Four factorial.

316
00:17:54 --> 00:17:56
Why four factorial?

317
00:17:56 --> 00:18:00.79
This will be a sum of n
factorial terms.

318
00:18:00.79 --> 00:18:04
Twenty-four,
a hundred and twenty,

319
00:18:04 --> 00:18:09
seven hundred and twenty,
whatever's after that.

320
00:18:09 --> 00:18:09
OK.

321
00:18:09 --> 00:18:12
Half plus and half minus.

322
00:18:12 --> 00:18:16
And where do those n factorial
--

323
00:18:16 --> 00:18:17
terms come from?

324
00:18:17 --> 00:18:21
This is the moment to listen to
this lecture.

325
00:18:21 --> 00:18:24
Where do those n factorial
terms come from?

326
00:18:24 --> 00:18:29
They come because the first,
the guy in the first row can be

327
00:18:29 --> 00:18:31
chosen n ways.

328
00:18:31 --> 00:18:34
And after he's chosen,
that's used up that,

329
00:18:34 --> 00:18:36
that column.

330
00:18:36 --> 00:18:40
So the one in the second row
can be chosen n minus one ways.

331
00:18:40 --> 00:18:44
And after she's chosen,
that second column has been

332
00:18:44 --> 00:18:44
used.

333
00:18:44 --> 00:18:49.35
And then the one in the third
row can be chosen n minus two

334
00:18:49.35 --> 00:18:53
ways, and after it's chosen --
notice how I'm getting these

335
00:18:53 --> 00:18:55
personal pronouns.

336
00:18:55 --> 00:18:57
But I've run out.

337
00:18:57 --> 00:19:00
And I'm not willing to stop
with three by three,

338
00:19:00 --> 00:19:04
so I'm just going to write the
formula down.

339
00:19:04 --> 00:19:08.57
So the one in the first row
comes from some column alpha.

340
00:19:08.57 --> 00:19:10
I don't know what alpha is.

341
00:19:10 --> 00:19:14
And the one in the -- I
multiply that by somebody in the

342
00:19:14 --> 00:19:19.5
second row that comes from some
different column.

343
00:19:19.5 --> 00:19:24
And I multiply that by somebody
in the third row who comes from

344
00:19:24 --> 00:19:26
some yet different column.

345
00:19:26 --> 00:19:30
And then in the n-th row,
I don't know what -- I don't

346
00:19:30 --> 00:19:31
know how to draw.

347
00:19:31 --> 00:19:33
Maybe omega,
for last.

348
00:19:33 --> 00:19:38
And the whole point is then
that -- that those column

349
00:19:38 --> 00:19:42.14
numbers are different,
that alpha, beta,

350
00:19:42.14 --> 00:19:46
gamma, omega,
that set of column numbers is

351
00:19:46 --> 00:19:50
some permutation,
permutation of one to n.

352
00:19:50 --> 00:19:55
It, it, the n column numbers
are each used once.

353
00:19:55 --> 00:19:58
And that gives us n factorial
terms.

354
00:19:58 --> 00:20:03
And when I choose a term,
that means I'm choosing

355
00:20:03 --> 00:20:07
somebody
from every row and column.

356
00:20:07 --> 00:20:12
And then I just -- like the way
I had this from row and column

357
00:20:12 --> 00:20:16
one, row and column two,
row and column three,

358
00:20:16 --> 00:20:20
so that -- what was the alpha
beta stuff in that,

359
00:20:20 --> 00:20:21
for that term here?

360
00:20:21 --> 00:20:23
Alpha was one,
beta was two,

361
00:20:23 --> 00:20:25
gamma was three.

362
00:20:25 --> 00:20:30
The permutation was,
was the trivial permutation,

363
00:20:30 --> 00:20:33
one two three,
everybody in the right order.

364
00:20:33 --> 00:20:35.26
You see that formula?

365
00:20:35.26 --> 00:20:39
It's -- do you see why I didn't
want to start with that the

366
00:20:39 --> 00:20:41
first day, Friday?

367
00:20:41 --> 00:20:44
I'd rather we understood the
properties.

368
00:20:44 --> 00:20:50
Because out of this formula,
presumably I could figure out

369
00:20:50 --> 00:20:51.76
all these properties.

370
00:20:51.76 --> 00:20:56.03
How would I know that the
determinant of the identity

371
00:20:56.03 --> 00:20:58
matrix was one,
for example,

372
00:20:58 --> 00:20:59
out of this formula?

373
00:20:59 --> 00:21:04
Why is -- if A is the identity
matrix, how does this formula

374
00:21:04 --> 00:21:06
give me a plus one?

375
00:21:06 --> 00:21:08
You see it, right?

376
00:21:08 --> 00:21:12
Because, because almost all the
terms are zeros.

377
00:21:12 --> 00:21:15
Which term isn't zero,
if, if A is the identity

378
00:21:15 --> 00:21:16
matrix?

379
00:21:16 --> 00:21:20
Almost all the terms are zero
because almost all the As are

380
00:21:20 --> 00:21:20
zero.

381
00:21:20 --> 00:21:25
It's only, the only time I'll
get something is if it's a one

382
00:21:25 --> 00:21:28
one times a two two times a
three three.

383
00:21:28 --> 00:21:31
Only, only the,
only the permutation that's in

384
00:21:31 --> 00:21:34
the right order will,
will give me something.

385
00:21:34 --> 00:21:36
It'll come with a plus sign.

386
00:21:36 --> 00:21:39.7
And the determinant of the
identity is one.

387
00:21:39.7 --> 00:21:43
So, so we could go back from
this formula and prove

388
00:21:43 --> 00:21:43
everything.

389
00:21:43 --> 00:21:46
We could even try to prove that
the

390
00:21:46 --> 00:21:50
determinant of A B was the
determinant of A times the

391
00:21:50 --> 00:21:52
determinant of B.

392
00:21:52 --> 00:21:55
But like next week we would
still be working on it,

393
00:21:55 --> 00:21:59
because it's not -- clear from
-- if I took A B,

394
00:21:59 --> 00:21:59
my God.

395
00:21:59 --> 00:22:00
You know --.

396
00:22:00 --> 00:22:04
The entries of A B would
be all these pieces.

397
00:22:04 --> 00:22:08.25
Well, probably,
it's probably -- historically

398
00:22:08.25 --> 00:22:11.64
it's been done,
but it won't be repeated in

399
00:22:11.64 --> 00:22:12
eighteen oh six.

400
00:22:12 --> 00:22:13
OK.

401
00:22:13 --> 00:22:18
It would be possible probably
to see, why the determinant of A

402
00:22:18 --> 00:22:21
equals the
determinant of A transpose.

403
00:22:21 --> 00:22:24
That was another,
like, miracle property at the

404
00:22:24 --> 00:22:25
end.

405
00:22:25 --> 00:22:28
That would, that would,
that's an easier one,

406
00:22:28 --> 00:22:29
which we could find.

407
00:22:29 --> 00:22:29
OK.

408
00:22:29 --> 00:22:32
Is that all right for the big
formula?

409
00:22:32 --> 00:22:37.36
I could take you then a,
a typical -- let me do an

410
00:22:37.36 --> 00:22:38
example.

411
00:22:38 --> 00:22:40
Which I'll just create.

412
00:22:40 --> 00:22:43
I'll take a four by four
matrix.

413
00:22:43 --> 00:22:47
I'll put some,
I'll put some ones in and some

414
00:22:47 --> 00:22:48
zeros in.

415
00:22:48 --> 00:22:48
OK.

416
00:22:48 --> 00:22:53.13
Let me -- I don't know how many
to

417
00:22:53.13 --> 00:22:55
put in, to tell the truth.

418
00:22:55 --> 00:22:58
I've never done this before.

419
00:22:58 --> 00:23:02.93
I don't know the determinant of
that matrix.

420
00:23:02.93 --> 00:23:08
So like mathematics is being
done for the first time in,

421
00:23:08 --> 00:23:10
in front of your eyes.

422
00:23:10 --> 00:23:13
What's the determinant?

423
00:23:13 --> 00:23:18
Well, a lot of -- there are
twenty-four terms,

424
00:23:18 --> 00:23:20
because it's four by four.

425
00:23:20 --> 00:23:25
Many of them will be zero,
because I've got all those

426
00:23:25 --> 00:23:26
zeros there.

427
00:23:26 --> 00:23:29
Maybe the whole determinant is
zero.

428
00:23:29 --> 00:23:32
I mean, I -- is that a singular
matrix?

429
00:23:32 --> 00:23:35
That possibility definitely
exists.

430
00:23:35 --> 00:23:39
I could, I could,
So one way to do it would be

431
00:23:39 --> 00:23:40
elimination.

432
00:23:40 --> 00:23:44
Actually, that would probably
be a fairly reasonable way.

433
00:23:44 --> 00:23:47
I could use elimination,
so I could use -- go back to

434
00:23:47 --> 00:23:50
those properties,
that -- and use elimination,

435
00:23:50 --> 00:23:54
get down, eliminate it down,
do I have a row of zeros at the

436
00:23:54 --> 00:23:56.55
end of elimination?

437
00:23:56.55 --> 00:23:58
The answer is zero.

438
00:23:58 --> 00:24:01
I was thinking,
shall I try this big formula?

439
00:24:01 --> 00:24:02
OK.

440
00:24:02 --> 00:24:04
Let's try the big formula.

441
00:24:04 --> 00:24:08
How -- tell me one way I can go
down the matrix,

442
00:24:08 --> 00:24:11
taking a one,
taking a one from

443
00:24:11 --> 00:24:14
every row and column,
and make it to the end?

444
00:24:14 --> 00:24:17
So it's -- I get something that
isn't zero.

445
00:24:17 --> 00:24:21
Well, one way to do it,
I could take that times that

446
00:24:21 --> 00:24:23
times that times that times
that.

447
00:24:23 --> 00:24:26
That would be one and,
and, and I just said,

448
00:24:26 --> 00:24:29
that comes in with what sign?

449
00:24:29 --> 00:24:29
Plus.

450
00:24:29 --> 00:24:32
That comes with a plus sign.

451
00:24:32 --> 00:24:38
Because, because that
permutation -- I've just written

452
00:24:38 --> 00:24:44
the permutation about four three
two one, and one exchange and a

453
00:24:44 --> 00:24:49
second exchange,
two exchanges puts it in the

454
00:24:49 --> 00:24:50
correct order.

455
00:24:50 --> 00:24:53
Keep walking away,
don't....

456
00:24:53 --> 00:24:58
OK, we're executing a
determinant

457
00:24:58 --> 00:25:00
formula here.

458
00:25:00 --> 00:25:06
Uh as long as it's not
periodic, of course.

459
00:25:06 --> 00:25:11
If he comes back I'm in -- no.

460
00:25:11 --> 00:25:14
All right, all right.

461
00:25:14 --> 00:25:19
OK, so that would give me a
plus one.

462
00:25:19 --> 00:25:21
All right.

463
00:25:21 --> 00:25:24
Are there any others?

464
00:25:24 --> 00:25:30
Well, of course we see
another one here.

465
00:25:30 --> 00:25:35
This times this times this
times this strikes us right

466
00:25:35 --> 00:25:35
away.

467
00:25:35 --> 00:25:40.5
So that's the order three,
the order -- let me make a

468
00:25:40.5 --> 00:25:42
little different mark here.

469
00:25:42 --> 00:25:44
Three two one four.

470
00:25:44 --> 00:25:49
And is that a plus or a minus,
three two one four?

471
00:25:49 --> 00:25:53
Is that, is that permutation a
plus

472
00:25:53 --> 00:25:54.78
or a minus permutation?

473
00:25:54.78 --> 00:25:55
It's a minus.

474
00:25:55 --> 00:25:56
How do you see that?

475
00:25:56 --> 00:26:00
What exchange shall I do to get
it in the right order?

476
00:26:00 --> 00:26:04
If I exchange the one and the
three I'm in the right orders,

477
00:26:04 --> 00:26:08
took one exchange to do it,
so that would be a plus -- that

478
00:26:08 --> 00:26:10
would be a minus one.

479
00:26:10 --> 00:26:14
And now I don't know if
there're any more here.

480
00:26:14 --> 00:26:14
Let's see.

481
00:26:14 --> 00:26:17
Let me try again starting with
this.

482
00:26:17 --> 00:26:21
Now I've got to pick somebody
from -- oh yeah,

483
00:26:21 --> 00:26:24
see, you see what's happening.

484
00:26:24 --> 00:26:28
If I I start there,
OK, column three is used.

485
00:26:28 --> 00:26:31
So then when I go to next row,
I can't use that,

486
00:26:31 --> 00:26:31
I must use that.

487
00:26:31 --> 00:26:34
Now columns two and three are
used.

488
00:26:34 --> 00:26:36
When I come to this row I must
use that.

489
00:26:36 --> 00:26:37
And then I must use that.

490
00:26:37 --> 00:26:41
So if I start there,
this is the only one I get.

491
00:26:41 --> 00:26:44
And similarly,
if I start there,

492
00:26:44 --> 00:26:46.28
that's the only one I get.

493
00:26:46.28 --> 00:26:48
So what's the determinant?

494
00:26:48 --> 00:26:50
What's the determinant?

495
00:26:50 --> 00:26:50
Zero.

496
00:26:50 --> 00:26:53
The determinant is zero for
that case.

497
00:26:53 --> 00:26:57.76
Because we, we were able to
check the

498
00:26:57.76 --> 00:26:58
twenty-four terms.

499
00:26:58 --> 00:27:00.63
Twenty-two of them were zero.

500
00:27:00.63 --> 00:27:02
One of them was plus one.

501
00:27:02 --> 00:27:03
One of them was minus one.

502
00:27:03 --> 00:27:06
Add up the twenty-four terms,
zero is the answer.

503
00:27:06 --> 00:27:06
OK.

504
00:27:06 --> 00:27:10
Well, I didn't know it would be
zero, I -- because I wasn't,

505
00:27:10 --> 00:27:12
like, thinking ahead.

506
00:27:12 --> 00:27:15
I was a little scared,
actually.

507
00:27:15 --> 00:27:17
I said, that,
apparition went by.

508
00:27:17 --> 00:27:21
So and I don't know if the
camera caught that.

509
00:27:21 --> 00:27:26
So whether the rest of the
world will realize that I was in

510
00:27:26 --> 00:27:29
danger or not,
we don't know.

511
00:27:29 --> 00:27:33.82
But anyway, I guess he just
wanted to be sure

512
00:27:33.82 --> 00:27:37
that we got the right answer,
which is determinant zero.

513
00:27:37 --> 00:27:41
And then that makes me think,
OK, the matrix must be,

514
00:27:41 --> 00:27:43
the matrix must be singular.

515
00:27:43 --> 00:27:47
And then if the matrix is
singular, maybe there's another

516
00:27:47 --> 00:27:52
way to see that it's singular,
like find something in its null

517
00:27:52 --> 00:27:53
space.

518
00:27:53 --> 00:27:57
Or find a combination of the
rows that gives zero.

519
00:27:57 --> 00:28:02
And like what d- what,
what combination of those rows

520
00:28:02 --> 00:28:03
does give zero.

521
00:28:03 --> 00:28:06
Suppose I add rows one and rows
three.

522
00:28:06 --> 00:28:11
If I add rows one and rows
three, what do I get?

523
00:28:11 --> 00:28:14
I get a row of all ones.

524
00:28:14 --> 00:28:18
Then if I add rows two and rows
four I get a row of all ones.

525
00:28:18 --> 00:28:22
So row one minus row two plus
row three minus row four is

526
00:28:22 --> 00:28:23
probably the zero row.

527
00:28:23 --> 00:28:25
It's a singular matrix.

528
00:28:25 --> 00:28:28
And I could find something in
its null space the same way.

529
00:28:28 --> 00:28:33
That would be a combination of
columns that gives zero.

530
00:28:33 --> 00:28:35
OK, there's an example.

531
00:28:35 --> 00:28:35.93
All right.

532
00:28:35.93 --> 00:28:39
So that's, well,
that shows two things.

533
00:28:39 --> 00:28:43
That shows how we get the
twenty-four terms and it shows

534
00:28:43 --> 00:28:47
the great advantage of having a
lot of zeros in there.

535
00:28:47 --> 00:28:47.98
OK.

536
00:28:47.98 --> 00:28:54
So we'll use this big formula,
but I want to pick -- I want to

537
00:28:54 --> 00:28:57
go onward now to cofactors.

538
00:28:57 --> 00:28:59
Onward to cofactors.

539
00:28:59 --> 00:29:04.62
Cofactors is a way of breaking
up this big formula that

540
00:29:04.62 --> 00:29:11
connects this n by n -- this is
an n by n determinant that we've

541
00:29:11 --> 00:29:15.08
just have a formula for,
the big formula.

542
00:29:15.08 --> 00:29:20
So cofactors is a way to
connect this n by n determinant

543
00:29:20 --> 00:29:24
to,
determinants one smaller.

544
00:29:24 --> 00:29:25
One smaller.

545
00:29:25 --> 00:29:32
And the way we want to do it is
actually going to show up in

546
00:29:32 --> 00:29:32
this.

547
00:29:32 --> 00:29:38
Since the three by three is the
one that we wrote out in full,

548
00:29:38 --> 00:29:44
let's, let me do this three by
-- so I'm talking about

549
00:29:44 --> 00:29:51
cofactors, and I'm going to
start again with three by three.

550
00:29:51 --> 00:29:55
And I'm going to take the,
the exact formula,

551
00:29:55 --> 00:30:00
and I'm just going to write it
as a one one -- this is the

552
00:30:00 --> 00:30:02
determinant I'm writing.

553
00:30:02 --> 00:30:06
I'm just going to say a one one
times what?

554
00:30:06 --> 00:30:08
A one one times what?

555
00:30:08 --> 00:30:14
And it's a one one times a two
two a three three minus a two

556
00:30:14 --> 00:30:16
three a three two.

557
00:30:16 --> 00:30:22
Then I've got the a one two
stuff times something.

558
00:30:22 --> 00:30:28
And I've got the a one three
stuff times something.

559
00:30:28 --> 00:30:30
Do you see what I'm doing?

560
00:30:30 --> 00:30:36
I'm taking our big formula and
I'm saying, OK,

561
00:30:36 --> 00:30:41
choose column -- out of the
first row,

562
00:30:41 --> 00:30:43
choose column one.

563
00:30:43 --> 00:30:46
And take all the possibilities.

564
00:30:46 --> 00:30:53
And those extra factors will be
what we'll call the cofactor,

565
00:30:53 --> 00:30:56
co meaning going with a one
one.

566
00:30:56 --> 00:31:00
So this in parenthesis are,
these are in,

567
00:31:00 --> 00:31:03.81
the cofactors are in parens.

568
00:31:03.81 --> 00:31:06
A one one times something.

569
00:31:06 --> 00:31:12
And I figured out what that
something was by just looking

570
00:31:12 --> 00:31:17
back -- if I can walk back here
to the, to the a one one,

571
00:31:17 --> 00:31:21
the one that comes down the
diagonal minus the one that

572
00:31:21 --> 00:31:22
comes that way.

573
00:31:22 --> 00:31:26.76
That's, those are the two,
only two that used a one one.

574
00:31:26.76 --> 00:31:30
So there they are,
one with a plus and one with a

575
00:31:30 --> 00:31:30
minus.

576
00:31:30 --> 00:31:36
And now I can write in the --
I could look back and see what

577
00:31:36 --> 00:31:40
used a one two and I can see
what used a one three,

578
00:31:40 --> 00:31:45
and those will give me the
cofactors of a one two and a one

579
00:31:45 --> 00:31:45
three.

580
00:31:45 --> 00:31:48
Before I do that,
what's this number,

581
00:31:48 --> 00:31:50
what is this cofactor?

582
00:31:50 --> 00:31:55.13
What is it there that's
multiplying a one one?

583
00:31:55.13 --> 00:32:01
Tell me what a two two a three
three minus a two three a three

584
00:32:01 --> 00:32:05.57
two is, for this -- do you
recognize that?

585
00:32:05.57 --> 00:32:11
Do you recognize -- let's see,
I can -- and I'll put it here.

586
00:32:11 --> 00:32:13
There's the a one one.

587
00:32:13 --> 00:32:16
That's used column one.

588
00:32:16 --> 00:32:21.64
Then there's --
the other factors involved

589
00:32:21.64 --> 00:32:23
these other columns.

590
00:32:23 --> 00:32:25
This row is used.

591
00:32:25 --> 00:32:27
This column is used.

592
00:32:27 --> 00:32:32
So this the only things left to
use are these.

593
00:32:32 --> 00:32:37
And this formula uses them,
and what's the,

594
00:32:37 --> 00:32:39
what's the cofactor?

595
00:32:39 --> 00:32:46.33
Tell me what it is because you
see it, and then --

596
00:32:46.33 --> 00:32:50
I'll be happy you see what the
idea of cofactors.

597
00:32:50 --> 00:32:54.39
It's the determinant of this
smaller guy.

598
00:32:54.39 --> 00:32:59
A one one multiplies the
determinant of this smaller guy.

599
00:32:59 --> 00:33:04
That gives me all the a one one
part of the big formula.

600
00:33:04 --> 00:33:05
You see that?

601
00:33:05 --> 00:33:11
This, the determinant of this
smaller guy is a two two a

602
00:33:11 --> 00:33:15
three three minus a two three a
three two.

603
00:33:15 --> 00:33:19
In other words,
once I've used column one and

604
00:33:19 --> 00:33:24
row one, what's left is all the
ways to use the other n-1

605
00:33:24 --> 00:33:26
columns and n-1 rows,
one of each.

606
00:33:26 --> 00:33:32
All the other -- and that's the
determinant of the smaller guy

607
00:33:32 --> 00:33:34
of size n-1.

608
00:33:34 --> 00:33:37
So that's the whole idea of
cofactors.

609
00:33:37 --> 00:33:42
And we just have to remember
that with determinants we've got

610
00:33:42 --> 00:33:46
pluses and minus signs to keep
straight.

611
00:33:46 --> 00:33:49
Can we keep this next one
straight?

612
00:33:49 --> 00:33:51
Let's do the next one.

613
00:33:51 --> 00:33:54
OK, the next one will be when I
use a one two.

614
00:33:54 --> 00:34:00
I'll have left --
so I can't use that column any

615
00:34:00 --> 00:34:07
more, but I can use a two one
and a two three and I can use a

616
00:34:07 --> 00:34:10
three one and a three three.

617
00:34:10 --> 00:34:15
So this one gave me a one times
that determinant.

618
00:34:15 --> 00:34:20
This will give me a one two
times this determinant,

619
00:34:20 --> 00:34:27
a two one a three three minus a
two three a three one.

620
00:34:27 --> 00:34:30
So that's all the stuff
involving a one two.

621
00:34:30 --> 00:34:33.46
But have I got the sign right?

622
00:34:33.46 --> 00:34:38
Is the determinant of that
correctly given by that or is

623
00:34:38 --> 00:34:39
there a minus sign?

624
00:34:39 --> 00:34:41.54
There is a minus sign.

625
00:34:41.54 --> 00:34:43
I can follow one of these.

626
00:34:43 --> 00:34:48
If I do that times that times
that, that was one that's

627
00:34:48 --> 00:34:52
showing up
here, but it should have showed

628
00:34:52 --> 00:34:55
-- it should have been a minus.

629
00:34:55 --> 00:34:59.91
So I'm going to build that
minus sign into the cofactor.

630
00:34:59.91 --> 00:35:04
So, so the cofactor -- so I'll
put, put that minus sign in

631
00:35:04 --> 00:35:05.14
here.

632
00:35:05.14 --> 00:35:09
So because the cofactor is
going to be strictly the thing

633
00:35:09 --> 00:35:13
that multiplies the,
the factor.

634
00:35:13 --> 00:35:16
The factor is a one two,
the cofactor is this,

635
00:35:16 --> 00:35:19.43
is the parens,
the stuff in parentheses.

636
00:35:19.43 --> 00:35:21
So it's got the minus sign
built in.

637
00:35:21 --> 00:35:25
And if I did -- if I went on to
the third guy,

638
00:35:25 --> 00:35:28
there w- there'll be this and
this, this and this.

639
00:35:28 --> 00:35:31
And it would take its
determinant.

640
00:35:31 --> 00:35:34
It would come out plus
the determinant.

641
00:35:34 --> 00:35:38
So now I'm ready to say what
cofactors are.

642
00:35:38 --> 00:35:42
So this would be a plus and a
one three times its cofactor.

643
00:35:42 --> 00:35:47
And over here we had plus a one
one times this determinant.

644
00:35:47 --> 00:35:51
But and there we had the a one
two times its cofactor,

645
00:35:51 --> 00:35:58
but the -- so the point is the
cofactor is either plus or

646
00:35:58 --> 00:36:00
minus the determinant.

647
00:36:00 --> 00:36:05
So let me write that underneath
them.

648
00:36:05 --> 00:36:09
What is the,
what are cofactors?

649
00:36:09 --> 00:36:14
The cofactor if any number aij,
let's say.

650
00:36:14 --> 00:36:19
This is, this is all the terms
in the,

651
00:36:19 --> 00:36:23
in the big formula that involve
aij.

652
00:36:23 --> 00:36:29
We're especially interested in
a1j, the first row,

653
00:36:29 --> 00:36:35
that's what I've been talking
about, but any row would be all

654
00:36:35 --> 00:36:36
right.

655
00:36:36 --> 00:36:40
All right, so -- what terms
involve aij?

656
00:36:40 --> 00:36:45
So --
it's the determinant of the n

657
00:36:45 --> 00:36:51
minus one matrix -- with row i,
column j erased.

658
00:36:51 --> 00:36:57.23
So it's the,
it's a matrix of size n-1 with

659
00:36:57.23 --> 00:37:02.86
-- of course,
because I can't use this row or

660
00:37:02.86 --> 00:37:05
this column again.

661
00:37:05 --> 00:37:09
So I have the matrix all there.

662
00:37:09 --> 00:37:15
But now it's multiplied
by a plus or a minus.

663
00:37:15 --> 00:37:19
This is the cofactor,
and I'm going to call that cij.

664
00:37:19 --> 00:37:25
Capital, I use capital c just
to, just to emphasize that these

665
00:37:25 --> 00:37:29
are important and emphasize that
they're, they're,

666
00:37:29 --> 00:37:32
they're different from the
(a)s.

667
00:37:32 --> 00:37:32
OK.

668
00:37:32 --> 00:37:36
So now is it a plus
or is it a minus?

669
00:37:36 --> 00:37:42
Because we see that in this
case, for a one one it was a

670
00:37:42 --> 00:37:46
plus, for a one two I -- this is
ij -- it was a minus.

671
00:37:46 --> 00:37:49
For this ij it was a plus.

672
00:37:49 --> 00:37:54
So any any guess on the rule
for plus or minus when we see

673
00:37:54 --> 00:37:58
those examples,
ij equal one one or one three

674
00:37:58 --> 00:38:00
was a plus?

675
00:38:00 --> 00:38:05
It sounds very like i+j odd or
even.

676
00:38:05 --> 00:38:12
That, that's doesn't surprise
us, and that's the right answer.

677
00:38:12 --> 00:38:20
So it's a plus if i+j is even
and it's a minus if i+j is odd.

678
00:38:20 --> 00:38:26
So if I go along row one and
look at the cofactors,

679
00:38:26 --> 00:38:34
I just take those determinants,
those one smaller determinants,

680
00:38:34 --> 00:38:38
and
they come in order plus minus

681
00:38:38 --> 00:38:40
plus minus plus minus.

682
00:38:40 --> 00:38:45
But if I go along row two and,
and, and take the cofactors of

683
00:38:45 --> 00:38:49
sub-determinants,
they would start with a minus,

684
00:38:49 --> 00:38:53
because the two one entry,
two plus one is odd,

685
00:38:53 --> 00:38:58
so the -- like there's a
pattern plus minus plus minus

686
00:38:58 --> 00:39:05
plus if it was five by
five, but then if I was doing a

687
00:39:05 --> 00:39:12
cofactor then this sign would be
minus plus minus plus minus,

688
00:39:12 --> 00:39:17
plus minus plus -- it's sort of
checkerboard.

689
00:39:17 --> 00:39:17
OK.

690
00:39:17 --> 00:39:17
OK.

691
00:39:17 --> 00:39:24.13
Those are the signs that,
that are given by this rule,

692
00:39:24.13 --> 00:39:25
i+j even or odd.

693
00:39:25 --> 00:39:31
And those are built
into the cofactors.

694
00:39:31 --> 00:39:36
The thing is called a minor
without th- before you've built

695
00:39:36 --> 00:39:40
in the sign, but I don't care
about those.

696
00:39:40 --> 00:39:44.02
Build in that sign and call it
a cofactor.

697
00:39:44.02 --> 00:39:44
OK.

698
00:39:44 --> 00:39:47
So what's the cofactor formula?

699
00:39:47 --> 00:39:50
What's the cofactor formula
then?

700
00:39:50 --> 00:39:54
Let me come back to this board
and

701
00:39:54 --> 00:39:58
say, what's the cofactor
formula?

702
00:39:58 --> 00:40:04
Determinant of A is -- let's go
along the first row.

703
00:40:04 --> 00:40:11
It's a one one times its
cofactor, and then the second

704
00:40:11 --> 00:40:18
guy is a one two times its
cofactor, and you just keep

705
00:40:18 --> 00:40:25
going to the end of the row,
a1n times its cofactor.

706
00:40:25 --> 00:40:31
So that's cofactor for --
along row one.

707
00:40:31 --> 00:40:38
And if I went along row I,
I would -- those ones would be

708
00:40:38 --> 00:40:38
Is.

709
00:40:38 --> 00:40:42
That's worth putting a box
over.

710
00:40:42 --> 00:40:46
That's the cofactor formula.

711
00:40:46 --> 00:40:53
Do you see that -- actually,
this would give me another way

712
00:40:53 --> 00:40:59
I could have started the whole
topic of determinants.

713
00:40:59 --> 00:41:05
And some, some people might do
it

714
00:41:05 --> 00:41:07
this -- choose to do it this
way.

715
00:41:07 --> 00:41:11
Because the cofactor formula
would allow me to build up an n

716
00:41:11 --> 00:41:14
by n determinant out of n-1
sized determinants,

717
00:41:14 --> 00:41:17
build those out of n-2,
and so on.

718
00:41:17 --> 00:41:19.99
I could boil all the way down
to one by ones.

719
00:41:19.99 --> 00:41:23
So what's the cofactor formula
for

720
00:41:23 --> 00:41:24
two by two matrices?

721
00:41:24 --> 00:41:26
Yeah, tell me that.

722
00:41:26 --> 00:41:28
What's the cofactor for us?

723
00:41:28 --> 00:41:32
Here is the,
here is the world's smallest

724
00:41:32 --> 00:41:35
example, practically,
of a cofactor formula.

725
00:41:35 --> 00:41:36
OK.

726
00:41:36 --> 00:41:38
Let's go along row one.

727
00:41:38 --> 00:41:42
I take this first guy
times its cofactor.

728
00:41:42 --> 00:41:46
What's the cofactor of the one
one entry?

729
00:41:46 --> 00:41:51
d, because you strike out the
one one row and column and

730
00:41:51 --> 00:41:53
you're left with d.

731
00:41:53 --> 00:41:57
Then I take this guy,
b, times its cofactor.

732
00:41:57 --> 00:42:00
What's the cofactor of b?

733
00:42:00 --> 00:42:05
Is it c or it's --
minus c, because I strike out

734
00:42:05 --> 00:42:10
this guy, I take that
determinant, and then I follow

735
00:42:10 --> 00:42:15
the i+j rule and I get a minus,
I get an odd.

736
00:42:15 --> 00:42:17
So it's b times minus c.

737
00:42:17 --> 00:42:19
OK, it worked.

738
00:42:19 --> 00:42:21
Of course it,
it worked.

739
00:42:21 --> 00:42:24
And the three by three works.

740
00:42:24 --> 00:42:29
So that's the cofactor formula,
and that is,

741
00:42:29 --> 00:42:33
that's an -- that's a good
formula to know,

742
00:42:33 --> 00:42:39
and now I'm feeling like,
wow, I'm giving you a lot of

743
00:42:39 --> 00:42:41
algebra to swallow here.

744
00:42:41 --> 00:42:45
Last lecture gave you ten
properties.

745
00:42:45 --> 00:42:51
Now I'm giving you -- and by
the way, those ten

746
00:42:51 --> 00:42:55
properties led us to a formula
for the determinant which was

747
00:42:55 --> 00:42:58
very important,
and I haven't repeated it till

748
00:42:58 --> 00:42:59
now.

749
00:42:59 --> 00:43:00
What was that?

750
00:43:00 --> 00:43:03
The, the determinant is the
product of the pivots.

751
00:43:03 --> 00:43:06
So the pivot formula is,
is very important.

752
00:43:06 --> 00:43:09
The pivots have all this
complicated

753
00:43:09 --> 00:43:11
mess already built in.

754
00:43:11 --> 00:43:16
As you did elimination to get
the pivots, you built in all

755
00:43:16 --> 00:43:19
this horrible stuff,
quite efficiently.

756
00:43:19 --> 00:43:23
Then the big formula with the n
factorial terms,

757
00:43:23 --> 00:43:27
that's got all the horrible
stuff spread out.

758
00:43:27 --> 00:43:32
And the cofactor formula is
like in between.

759
00:43:32 --> 00:43:36
It's got easy stuff times
horrible stuff,

760
00:43:36 --> 00:43:37
basically.

761
00:43:37 --> 00:43:42
But it's, it shows you,
how to get determinants from

762
00:43:42 --> 00:43:47
smaller determinants,
and that's the application that

763
00:43:47 --> 00:43:49
I now want to make.

764
00:43:49 --> 00:43:52.7
So may I do one more example?

765
00:43:52.7 --> 00:43:55
So I remember the general idea.

766
00:43:55 --> 00:44:00
But I'm going to use this
cofactor

767
00:44:00 --> 00:44:06
formula for a matrix -- so here
is going to be my example.

768
00:44:06 --> 00:44:11.4
It's -- I promised in the,
in the lecture,

769
00:44:11.4 --> 00:44:16
outline at the very beginning
to do an example.

770
00:44:16 --> 00:44:22
And let me do -- I'm going to
pick tri-diagonal matrix of

771
00:44:22 --> 00:44:24
ones.

772
00:44:24 --> 00:44:30.01
I could, I'm drawing here the
four by four.

773
00:44:30.01 --> 00:44:33
So this will be the matrix.

774
00:44:33 --> 00:44:36
I could call that A4.

775
00:44:36 --> 00:44:40.93
But my real idea is to do n by
n.

776
00:44:40.93 --> 00:44:42
To do them all.

777
00:44:42 --> 00:44:51
So A -- I could -- everybody
understands what A1 and A2 are.

778
00:44:51 --> 00:44:53
Yeah.

779
00:44:53 --> 00:44:58.63
Maybe we should just do A1 and
A2 and A3 just for -- so this is

780
00:44:58.63 --> 00:44:58
A4.

781
00:44:58 --> 00:45:01
What's the determinant of A1?

782
00:45:01 --> 00:45:04.09
What's the determinant of A1?

783
00:45:04.09 --> 00:45:07
So, so what's the matrix A1 in
this formula?

784
00:45:07 --> 00:45:09.64
It's just got that.

785
00:45:09.64 --> 00:45:11
So the determinant is one.

786
00:45:11 --> 00:45:14
What's the determinant of A2?

787
00:45:14 --> 00:45:18
So it's just got this two by
two,

788
00:45:18 --> 00:45:20
and its determinant is -- zero.

789
00:45:20 --> 00:45:23
And then the three by three.

790
00:45:23 --> 00:45:25
Can we see its determinant?

791
00:45:25 --> 00:45:29
Can you take the determinant of
that three by three?

792
00:45:29 --> 00:45:33
Well, that's not quite so
obvious, at least not to me.

793
00:45:33 --> 00:45:37
Being three by three,
I don't know -- so here's a,

794
00:45:37 --> 00:45:40
here's a good example.

795
00:45:40 --> 00:45:43
How would you do that three by
three determinant?

796
00:45:43 --> 00:45:46
We've got, like,
n factorial different ways.

797
00:45:46 --> 00:45:47
Well, three factorial.

798
00:45:47 --> 00:45:49
So we've got six ways.

799
00:45:49 --> 00:45:49
OK.

800
00:45:49 --> 00:45:53
I mean, one way to do it --
actually the way I would

801
00:45:53 --> 00:45:55
probably do it,
being three by three,

802
00:45:55 --> 00:45:58
I would use the complete the
big formula.

803
00:45:58 --> 00:46:00
I would say,
I've got a one from that,

804
00:46:00 --> 00:46:03
I've got a zero from that,
I've got a zero from that,

805
00:46:03 --> 00:46:05
a zero from that,
and this direction is a minus

806
00:46:05 --> 00:46:09.01
one,
that direction's a minus one.

807
00:46:09.01 --> 00:46:11
I believe the answer is minus
one.

808
00:46:11 --> 00:46:13
Would you do it another way?

809
00:46:13 --> 00:46:16
Here's another way to do it,
look.

810
00:46:16 --> 00:46:21
Subtract row three from -- I'm
just looking at this three by

811
00:46:21 --> 00:46:21
three.

812
00:46:21 --> 00:46:25
Everybody's looking at the
three by three.

813
00:46:25 --> 00:46:28
Subtract row three from row
two.

814
00:46:28 --> 00:46:30
Determinant doesn't change.

815
00:46:30 --> 00:46:32.44
So those become zeros.

816
00:46:32.44 --> 00:46:34
OK, now use the cofactor
formula.

817
00:46:34 --> 00:46:35
How's that?

818
00:46:35 --> 00:46:40
How can, how -- if this was now
zeros and I'm looking at this

819
00:46:40 --> 00:46:43
three by three,
use the cofactor formula.

820
00:46:43 --> 00:46:48
Why not use the cofactor
formula along that row?

821
00:46:48 --> 00:46:53
Because then I take that number
times its cofactor,

822
00:46:53 --> 00:46:59
so I take this number -- let me
put a box around it -- times its

823
00:46:59 --> 00:47:04.97
cofactor, which is the
determinant of that and that,

824
00:47:04.97 --> 00:47:06
which is what?

825
00:47:06 --> 00:47:10
That two by two matrix has
determinant one.

826
00:47:10 --> 00:47:13
So what's the cofactor?

827
00:47:13 --> 00:47:17
What's the cofactor of this guy
here?

828
00:47:17 --> 00:47:21
Looking just at this three by
three.

829
00:47:21 --> 00:47:25
The cofactor of that one is
this determinant,

830
00:47:25 --> 00:47:28
which is one times negative.

831
00:47:28 --> 00:47:33
So that's why the answer came
out minus one.

832
00:47:33 --> 00:47:34.59
OK.

833
00:47:34.59 --> 00:47:36
So I did the three by three.

834
00:47:36 --> 00:47:39
I don't know if we want to try
the four by four.

835
00:47:39 --> 00:47:42
Yeah, let's -- I guess that was
the point of my example,

836
00:47:42 --> 00:47:44
of course, so I have to try it.

837
00:47:44 --> 00:47:47
Sorry, I'm in a good mood
today, so you have to stand for

838
00:47:47 --> 00:47:49.59
all the bad jokes.

839
00:47:49.59 --> 00:47:49
OK.

840
00:47:49 --> 00:47:50
OK.

841
00:47:50 --> 00:47:52.95
So what was the matrix?

842
00:47:52.95 --> 00:47:53
Ah.

843
00:47:53 --> 00:47:57
OK, now I'm ready for four by
four.

844
00:47:57 --> 00:48:04
Who wants to -- who wants to
guess the, the -- I don't know,

845
00:48:04 --> 00:48:10
frankly, this four by four,
what's, what's the determinant.

846
00:48:10 --> 00:48:14
I plan to use cofactors.

847
00:48:14 --> 00:48:16
OK, let's use cofactors.

848
00:48:16 --> 00:48:21
The determinant of A4 is -- OK,
let's use cofactors on the

849
00:48:21 --> 00:48:22
first row.

850
00:48:22 --> 00:48:23.77
Those are easy.

851
00:48:23.77 --> 00:48:28
So I multiply this number,
which is a convenient one,

852
00:48:28 --> 00:48:30
times this determinant.

853
00:48:30 --> 00:48:34
So it's, it's one times the,
this three by three

854
00:48:34 --> 00:48:35
determinant.

855
00:48:35 --> 00:48:40
Now what is -- do you recognize
that matrix?

856
00:48:40 --> 00:48:40
It's A3.

857
00:48:40 --> 00:48:44
So it's one times the
determinant of A3.

858
00:48:44 --> 00:48:49
Coming along this row is a one
times this determinant,

859
00:48:49 --> 00:48:52
and it goes with a plus,
right?

860
00:48:52 --> 00:48:55
And then we have this one.

861
00:48:55 --> 00:48:58
And what is its cofactor?

862
00:48:58 --> 00:49:01
Now I'm looking at,
now I'm looking at this three

863
00:49:01 --> 00:49:05
by three, this three by three,
so I'm looking at the three by

864
00:49:05 --> 00:49:07
three that I haven't X-ed out.

865
00:49:07 --> 00:49:11.12
What is that -- oh,
now it, we did a plus or a --

866
00:49:11.12 --> 00:49:14
is it plus this determinant,
this three by three

867
00:49:14 --> 00:49:16
determinant, or minus it?

868
00:49:16 --> 00:49:19
It's minus it,
right, because this is -- I'm

869
00:49:19 --> 00:49:23
starting in a one two position,
and that's a minus.

870
00:49:23 --> 00:49:26
So I want minus this
determinant.

871
00:49:26 --> 00:49:28
But these guys are X-ed out.

872
00:49:28 --> 00:49:28
OK.

873
00:49:28 --> 00:49:30
So I've got a three by three.

874
00:49:30 --> 00:49:32
Well, let's use cofactors
again.

875
00:49:32 --> 00:49:38
Use cofactors of the column,
because actually we could use

876
00:49:38 --> 00:49:41
cofactors of columns just as
well as rows,

877
00:49:41 --> 00:49:44.64
because, because the transpose
rule.

878
00:49:44.64 --> 00:49:48
So I'll take this one,
which is now sitting in the

879
00:49:48 --> 00:49:52
plus position,
times its determinant -- oh!

880
00:49:52 --> 00:49:52
Oh, hell.

881
00:49:52 --> 00:49:57
What -- oh yeah,
I shouldn't have said hell,

882
00:49:57 --> 00:49:58
because it's all right.

883
00:49:58 --> 00:49:58
OK.

884
00:49:58 --> 00:50:00
One times the determinant.

885
00:50:00 --> 00:50:03
What is that matrix now that
I'm taking the,

886
00:50:03 --> 00:50:04
this smaller one of?

887
00:50:04 --> 00:50:06
Oh, but there's a minus,
right?

888
00:50:06 --> 00:50:10.4
The minus came from,
from the fact that this was in

889
00:50:10.4 --> 00:50:13
the one two position and that's
odd.

890
00:50:13 --> 00:50:20
So this is a minus one times --
and what's -- and then this one

891
00:50:20 --> 00:50:25
is the upper left,
that's the one one position in

892
00:50:25 --> 00:50:27
its matrix, so plus.

893
00:50:27 --> 00:50:30
And what's this matrix here?

894
00:50:30 --> 00:50:32
Do you recognize that?

895
00:50:32 --> 00:50:36
That matrix is -- yes,
please say it -- A2.

896
00:50:36 --> 00:50:41
And we -- that's our formula
for any case.

897
00:50:41 --> 00:50:47.81
A of any size n is equal to the
determinant of A n minus one,

898
00:50:47.81 --> 00:50:53
that's what came from taking
the one in the upper corner,

899
00:50:53 --> 00:50:57
the first cofactor,
minus the determinant of A n

900
00:50:57 --> 00:50:58
minus two.

901
00:50:58 --> 00:51:02
What we discovered there is
true for all n.

902
00:51:02 --> 00:51:08
I didn't even mention it,
but I stopped taking cofactors

903
00:51:08 --> 00:51:10
when I got this one.

904
00:51:10 --> 00:51:11
Why did I stop?

905
00:51:11 --> 00:51:15
Why didn't I take the cofactor
of this guy?

906
00:51:15 --> 00:51:19
Because he's going to get
multiplied by zero,

907
00:51:19 --> 00:51:21
and no, no use wasting time.

908
00:51:21 --> 00:51:22
Or this one too.

909
00:51:22 --> 00:51:27
The cofactor,
her cofactor will be whatever

910
00:51:27 --> 00:51:30
that determinant is,
but it'll be multiplied by

911
00:51:30 --> 00:51:32
zero, so I won't bother.

912
00:51:32 --> 00:51:34
OK, there is the formula.

913
00:51:34 --> 00:51:39
And that now tells us -- I
could figure out what A4 is now.

914
00:51:39 --> 00:51:42
Oh yeah, finally I can get A4.

915
00:51:42 --> 00:51:45
Because it's A3,
which is minus one,

916
00:51:45 --> 00:51:49
minus A2, which is zero,
so it's minus one.

917
00:51:49 --> 00:51:54
You see how we're getting kind
of numbers that you might not

918
00:51:54 --> 00:51:55
have guessed.

919
00:51:55 --> 00:52:00
So our sequence right now is
one zero minus one minus one.

920
00:52:00 --> 00:52:03.71
What's the next one in the
sequence, A5?

921
00:52:03.71 --> 00:52:08
A5 is this minus this,
so it is zero.

922
00:52:08 --> 00:52:09
What's A6?

923
00:52:09 --> 00:52:13
A6 is this minus this,
which is one.

924
00:52:13 --> 00:52:14
What's A7?

925
00:52:14 --> 00:52:22
I'm, I'm going to be stopped by
either the time runs out or the

926
00:52:22 --> 00:52:24
board runs out.

927
00:52:24 --> 00:52:28
OK, A7 is this minus this,
which is one.

928
00:52:28 --> 00:52:33
I'll stop here,
because time is out,

929
00:52:33 --> 00:52:36.61
but let me tell you what we've
got.

930
00:52:36.61 --> 00:52:41
What -- these determinants have
this series, one zero minus one

931
00:52:41 --> 00:52:45
minus one zero one,
and then it starts repeating.

932
00:52:45 --> 00:52:47
It's pretty fantastic.

933
00:52:47 --> 00:52:50.41
These determinants have period
six.

934
00:52:50.41 --> 00:52:54
So the determinant of A
sixty-one

935
00:52:54 --> 00:52:58
would be the determinant of A1,
which would be one.

936
00:52:58 --> 00:52:58
OK.

937
00:52:58 --> 00:53:01
I hope you liked that example.

938
00:53:01 --> 00:53:05
A non-trivial example of a
tri-diagonal determinant.

939
00:53:05 --> 00:53:05
Thanks.

940
00:53:05 --> 00:53:08
See you on Wednesday.
