<p></p> <p>Yes, OK, four, three, two, one, OK, I see you guys are in a happy mood.</p> <p>I  don't know if that means 18.06 is ending, or, the quiz was good. Uh, my  birthday conference was going on at the time of the quiz, and in the  conference, of course, everybody had to say nice things, but I was  wondering, what would my 18.06 class be saying, because it was at the  exactly the same time.</p> <p>But, what I know from the grades so far,  they're basically close to, and maybe slightly above the grades that you  got on quiz two. So, very satisfactory.</p> <p>And, then we have a  final exam coming up, and today's lecture, as I told you by email, will  be a first step in the review, and then on Wednesday I'll do all I can  in reviewing the whole course. So my topic today is -- actually, this is  a lecture I have never given before in this way, and it will -- well,  four subspaces, that's certainly fundamental, and you know that, so I  want to speak about left-inverses and right-inverses and then something  called pseudo-inverses.</p> <p>And pseudo-inverses, let me say right  away, that comes in near the end of chapter seven, and that would not be  expected on the final.</p> <p>But you'll see that what I'm talking  about is really the basic stuff that, for an m-by-n matrix of rank r,  we're going back to the most fundamental picture in linear algebra.  Nobody could forget that picture, right? When you're my age, even,  you'll remember the row space, and the null space.</p> <p>Orthogonal  complements over there, the column space and the null space of A  transpose column, orthogonal complements over here. And I want to speak  about inverses. OK.</p> <p>And I want to identify the different possibilities.</p> <p>So  first of all, when does a matrix have a just a perfect inverse,  two-sided, you know, so the two-sided inverse is what we just call  inverse, right? And, so that means that there's a matrix that produces  the identity, whether we write it on the left or on the right. And just  tell me, how are the numbers r, the rank, n the number of columns, m the  number of rows, how are those numbers related when we have an  invertible matrix? So this is the matrix which was -- chapter two was  all about matrices like this, the beginning of the course, what was the  relation of th- of r, m, and n, for the nice case? They're all the same,  all equal.</p> <p>So thisisthecasewhenr=m=n. Square matrix, full rank,  period, just -- so I'll use the words full rank. OK, good. Everybody  knows that. OK.</p> <p>Then chapter three. We began to deal with  matrices that were not of full rank, and they could have any rank, and  we learned what the rank was.</p> <p>And then we focused, if you  remember on some cases like full column rank. Now, can you remember what  was the deal with full column rank? So, now, I think this is the case  in which we have a left-inverse, and I'll try to find it. So we have a  -- what was the situation there? It's the case of full column rank, and  that means -- what does that mean about r? It equals, what's the deal  with r, now, if we have full column rank, I mean the columns are  independent, but maybe not the rows. So what is r equal to in this case?  n.</p> <p>Thanks. n.</p> <p>r=n. The n columns are independent, but probably, we have more rows.</p> <p>What's  the picture, and then what's the null space for this? So the n columns  are independent, what's the null space in this case? So of course, you  know what I'm asking.</p> <p>You're saying, why is this guy asking  something, I know that-- I think about it in my sleep, right? So the  null space of this matrix if the rank is n, the null space is what  vectors are in the null space? Just the zero vector.</p> <p>Right? The columns are independent.</p> <p>Independent  columns. No combination of the columns gives zero except that one. And  what's my picture over, -- let me redraw my picture -- the row space is  everything.</p> <p>No. Is that right? Let's see, I often get these  turned around, right? So what's the deal? The columns are independent,  right? So the rank should be the full number of columns, so what does  that tell us? There's no null space, right. OK. The row space is the  whole thing.</p> <p>Yes, I won't even draw the picture.</p> <p>And what  was the deal with -- and these were very important in least squares  problems because -- So, what more is true here? If we have full column  rank, the null space is zero, we have independent columns, the unique --  so we have zero or one solutions to Ax=b. There may not be any  solutions, but if there's a solution, there's only one solution because  other solutions are found by adding on stuff from the null space, and  there's nobody there to add on. So the particular solution is the  solution, if there is a particular solution. But of course, the rows  might not be - are probably not independent -- and therefore, so  right-hand sides won't end up with a zero equal zero after elimination,  so sometimes we may have no solution, or one solution.</p> <p>OK. And  what I want to say is that for this matrix A -- oh, yes, tell me  something about A transpose A in this case. So this whole part of the  board, now, is devoted to this case.</p> <p>What's the deal with A  transpose A? I've emphasized over and over how important that  combination is, for a rectangular matrix, A transpose A is the good  thing to look at, and if the rank is n, if the null space has only zero  in it, then the same is true of A transpose A.</p> <p>That's the  beautiful fact, that if the rank of A is n, well, we know this will be  an n by n symmetric matrix, and it will be full rank. So this is  invertible.</p> <p>This matrix is invertible. That matrix is invertible.</p> <p>And now I want to show you that A itself has a one-sided inverse. Here it is.</p> <p>The  inverse of that, which exists, times A transpose, there is a one-sided  -- shall I call it A inverse? -- left of the matrix A.</p> <p>Why do I  say that? Because if I multiply this guy by A, what do I get? What does  that multiplication give? Of course, you know it instantly, because I  just put the parentheses there, I have A transpose A inverse times A  transpose A so, of course, it's the identity. So it's a left inverse.</p> <p>And  this was the totally crucial case for least squares, because you  remember that least squares, the central equation of least squares had  this matrix, A transpose A, as its coefficient matrix. And in the case  of full column rank, that matrix is invertible, and we're go.</p> <p>So  that's the case where there is a left-inverse. So A does whatever it  does, we can find a matrix that brings it back to the identity. Now, is  it true that, in the other order -- so A inverse left times A is the  identity. Right? This matrix is m by n. This matrix is n by m. The  identity matrix is n by n. All good.</p> <p>All good if you're n. But if you try to put that matrix on the other side, it would fail.</p> <p>If  the full column rank -- if this is smaller than m, the case where  they're equals is the beautiful case, but that's all set. Now, we're  looking at the case where the columns are independent but the rows are  not. So this is invertible, but what matrix is not invertible? A A  transpose is bad for this case. A transpose A is good. So we can  multiply on the left, everything good, we get the left inverse.</p> <p>But it would not be a two-sided inverse.</p> <p>A  rectangular matrix can't have a two-sided inverse, because there's got  to be some null space, right? If I have a matrix that's rectangular,  then either that matrix or its transpose has some null space, because if  n and m are different, then there's going to be some free variables  around, and we'll have some null space in that direction. OK, tell me  the corresponding picture for the opposite case. So now I'm going to ask  you about right-inverses. A right-inverse.</p> <p>And you can fill this  all out, this is going to be the case of full row rank. And then r is  equal to m, now, the m rows are independent, but the columns are not. So  what's the deal on that? Well, just exactly the flip of this one.</p> <p>The  null space of A transpose contains only zero, because there are no  combinations of the rows that give the zero row. We have independent  rows. And in a minute, I'll give an example of all these. So, how many  solutions to Ax=b in this case? The rows are independent. So we can  always solve Ax=b. Whenever elimination never produces a zero row, so we  never get into that zero equal one problem, so Ax=b always has a  solution, but too many. So there will be some null space, the null space  of A -- what will be the dimension of A's null space? How many free  variables have we got? How many special solutions in that null space  have we got? So how many free variables in this setup? We've got n  columns, so n variables, and this tells us how many are pivot variables,  that tells us how many pivots there are, so there are n-m free  variables.</p> <p>So there are infinitely many solutions to Ax=b.</p> <p>We have n-m free variables in this case.</p> <p>OK.  Now I wanted to ask about this idea of a right-inverse. OK. So I'm  going to have a matrix A, my matrix A, and now there's going to be some  inverse on the right that will give the identity matrix. So it will be A  times A inverse on the right, will be I.</p> <p>And can you tell me  what, just by comparing with what we had up there, what will be the  right-inverse, we even have a formula for it. There will be other --  actually, there are other left-inverses, that's our favorite. There will  be other right-inverses, but tell me our favorite here, what's the nice  right-inverse? The nice right-inverse will be, well, there we had A  transpose A was good, now it will be A A transpose that's good. The good  matrix, the good right -- the thing we can invert is A A transpose, so  now if I just do it that way, there sits the right-inverse. You see how  completely parallel it is to the one above? Right.</p> <p>So that's the  right-inverse. So that's the case when there is -- In terms of this  picture, tell me what the null spaces are like so far for these three  cases. What about case one, where we had a two-sided inverse, full rank,  everything great.</p> <p>The null spaces were, like, gone, right? The null spaces were just the zero vectors.</p> <p>Then I took case two, this null space was gone.</p> <p>Case  three, this null space was gone, and then case four is, like, the most  general case when this picture is all there -- when all the null spaces  -- this has dimension r, of course, this has dimension n-r, this has  dimension r, this has dimension m-r, and the final case will be when r  is smaller than m and n. But can I just, before I leave here look a  little more at this one? At this case of full column rank? So A inverse  on the left, it has this left-inverse to give the identity. I said if we  multiply it in the other order, we wouldn't get the identity.</p> <p>But  then I just realized that I should ask you, what do we get? So if I put  them in the other order -- if I continue this down below, but I write A  times A inverse left -- so there's A times the left-inverse, but it's  not on the left any more.</p> <p>So it's not going to come out  perfectly. But everybody in this room ought to recognize that matrix,  right? Let's see, is that the guy we know? Am I OK, here? What is that  matrix? P.</p> <p>Thanks. P.</p> <p>That matrix -- it's a projection.</p> <p>It's the projection onto the column space.</p> <p>It's  trying to be the identity matrix, right? A projection matrix tries to  be the identity matrix, but you've given it, an impossible job.</p> <p>So it's the identity matrix where it can be, and elsewhere, it's the zero matrix.</p> <p>So this is P, right.</p> <p>A  projection onto the column space. OK. And if I asked you this one, and  put these in the opposite order -- so this came from up here. And  similarly, if I try to put the right inverse on the left -- so that,  like, came from above. This, coming from this side, what happens if I  try to put the right inverse on the left? Then I would have A transpose  A, A transpose inverse A, if this matrix is now on the left, what do you  figure that matrix is? It's going to be a projection, too, right? It  looks very much like this guy, except the only difference is, A and A  transpose have been reversed. So this is a projection, this is another  projection, onto the row space.</p> <p>Again, it's trying to be the  identity, but there's only so much the matrix can do. And this is the  projection onto the column space. So let me now go back to the main  picture and tell you about the general case, the pseudo-inverse. These  are cases we know.</p> <p>So this was important review. You've got to  know the business about these ranks, and the free variables -- really,  this is linear algebra coming together.</p> <p>And, you know, one nice thing about teaching 18.06, It's not trivial.</p> <p>But  it's -- I don't know, somehow, it's nice when it comes out right. I  mean -- well, I shouldn't say anything bad about calculus, but I will. I  mean, like, you know, you have formulas for surface area, and other  awful things and, you know, they do their best in calculus, but it's not  elegant. And, linear algebra just is -- well, you know, linear algebra  is about the nice part of calculus, where everything's, like, flat, and,  the formulas come out right. And you can go into high dimensions where,  in calculus, you're trying to visualize these things, well, two or  three dimensions is kind of the limit. But here, we don't -- you know,  I've stopped doing two-by-twos, I'm just talking about the general case.  OK, now I really will speak about the general case here. What could be  the inverse -- what's a kind of reasonable inverse for a matrix for the  completely general matrix where there's a rank r, but it's smaller than  n, so there's some null space left, and it's smaller than m, so a  transpose has some null space, and it's those null spaces that are  screwing up inverses, right? Because if a matrix takes a vector to zero,  well, there's no way an inverse can, like, bring it back to life.</p> <p>My  topic is now the pseudo-inverse, and let's just by a picture, see  what's the best inverse we could have? So, here's a vector x in the row  space. I multiply by A.</p> <p>Now, the one thing everybody knows is you  take a vector, you multiply by A, and you get an output, and where is  that output? Where is Ax? Always in the column space, right? Ax is a  combination of the columns.</p> <p>So Ax is somewhere here. So I could take all the vectors in the row space. I could multiply them all by A.</p> <p>I  would get a bunch of vectors in the column space and what I think is,  I'd get all the vectors in the column space just right. I think that  this connection between an x in the row space and an Ax in the column  space, this is one-to-one. We got a chance, because they have the same  dimension.</p> <p>That's an r-dimensional space, and that's an  r-dimensional space. And somehow, the matrix A -- it's got these null  spaces hanging around, where it's knocking vectors to zero.</p> <p>And  then it's got all the vectors in between, which is almost all vectors.  Almost all vectors have a row space component and a null space  component.</p> <p>And it's killing the null space component.</p> <p>But  if I look at the vectors that are in the row space, with no null space  component, just in the row space, then they all go into the column  space, so if I put another vector, let's say, y, in the row space, I  positive that wherever Ay is, it won't hit Ax. Do you see what I'm  saying? Let's see why. All right.</p> <p>So here's what I said. If x and y are in the row space, then A x is not the same as A y.</p> <p>They're  both in the column space, of course, but they're different. That would  be a perfect question on a final exam, because that's what I'm teaching  you in that material of chapter three and chapter four, especially  chapter three. If x and y are in the row space, then Ax is different  from Ay.</p> <p>So what this means -- and we'll see why -- is that, in  words, from the row space to the column space, A is perfect, it's an  invertible matrix.</p> <p>If we, like, limited it to those spaces.</p> <p>And  then, its inverse will be what I'll call the pseudo-inverse. So that's  that the pseudo-inverse is. It's the inverse -- so A goes this way, from  x to y -- sorry, x to A x, from y to A y, that's A, going that way.  Then in the other direction, anything in the column space comes from  somebody in the row space, and the reverse there is what I'll call the  pseudo-inverse, and the accepted notation is A plus. So y will be A plus  x.</p> <p>I'm sorry. No, y will be A plus times whatever it started with, A y.</p> <p>Do  you see my picture there? Same, of course, for x and A x. This way, A  does it, the other way is the pseudo-inverse, and the pseudo-inverse  just kills this stuff, and the matrix just kills this stuff.</p> <p>So  everything that's really serious here is going on in the row space and  the column space, and now, tell me -- this is the fundamental fact, that  between those two r-dimensional spaces, our matrix is perfect.</p> <p>Why? Suppose they weren't.</p> <p>Why do I get into trouble? Suppose -- so, proof. I haven't written down proof very much, but I'm going to use that word once.</p> <p>Suppose  they were the same. Suppose these are supposed to be two different  vectors. Maybe I'd better make the statement correctly. If x and y are  different vectors in the row space -- maybe I'll better put if x is  different from y, both in the row space -- so I'm starting with two  different vectors in the row space, I'm multiplying by A -- so these  guys are in the column space, everybody knows that, and the point is,  they're different over there. So, suppose they weren't.</p> <p>Suppose A x=A y. Suppose, well, that's the same as saying A(x-y) is zero.</p> <p>So  what? So, what do I know now about (x-y), what do I know about this  vector? Well, I can see right away, what space is it in? It's sitting in  the null space, right? So it's in the null space. But what else do I  know about it? Here it was x in the row space, y in the row space, what  about x-y? It's also in the row space, right? Heck, that thing is a  vector space, and if the vector space is anything at all, if x is in the  row space, and y is in the row space, then the difference is also, so  it's also in the row space. So what? Now I've got a vector x-y that's in  the null space, and that's also in the row space, so what vector is it?  It's the zero vector. So I would conclude from that that x-y had to be  the zero vector, x-y, so, in other words, if I start from two different  vectors, I get two different vectors.</p> <p>If these vectors are the  same, then those vectors had to be the same. That's like the algebra  proof, which we understand completely because we really understand these  subspaces of what I said in words, that a matrix A is really a nice,  invertible mapping from row space to columns pace. If the null spaces  keep out of the way, then we have an inverse.</p> <p>And that inverse is  called the pseudo inverse, and it's a very, very, useful in  application. Statisticians discovered, oh boy, this is the thing that we  needed all our lives, and here it finally showed up, the pseudo-inverse  is the right thing. Why do statisticians need it? And because  statisticians are like least-squares-happy. I mean they're always doing  least squares. And so this is their central linear regression.  Statisticians who may watch this on video, please forgive that  description of your interests. One of your interests is linear  regression and this problem. But this problem is only OK provided we  have full column rank.</p> <p>And statisticians have to worry all the time about, oh, God, maybe we just repeated an experiment.</p> <p>You know, you're taking all these measurements, maybe you just repeat them a few times. You know, maybe they're not independent.</p> <p>Well,  in that case, that A transpose A matrix that they depend on becomes  singular. So then that's when they needed the pseudo-inverse, it just  arrived at the right moment, and it's the right quantity.</p> <p>OK. So now that you know what the pseudo-inverse should do, let me see what it is.</p> <p>Can we find it? So this is my -- to complete the lecture is -- how do I find this pseudo-inverse A plus? OK. OK.</p> <p>Well,  here's one way. Everything I do today is to try to review stuff. One  way would be to start from the SVD. The Singular Value Decomposition.  And you remember that that factored A into an orthogonal matrix times  this diagonal matrix times this orthogonal matrix.</p> <p>But what did  that diagonal guy look like? This diagonal guy, sigma, has some  non-zeroes, and you remember, they came from A transpose A, and A A  transpose, these are the good guys, and then some more zeroes, and all  zeroes there, and all zeroes there. So you can guess what the  pseudo-inverse is, I just invert stuff that's nice to invert -- well,  what's the pseudo-inverse of this? That's what the problem comes down  to. What's the pseudo-inverse of this beautiful diagonal matrix? But  it's got a null space, right? What's the rank of this matrix? What's the  rank of this diagonal matrix? r, of course. It's got r non-zeroes, and  then it's otherwise, zip.</p> <p>So it's got n columns, it's got m rows,  and it's got rank r. It's the best example, the simplest example we  could ever have of our general setup.</p> <p>OK? So what's the  pseudo-inverse? What's the matrix -- so I'll erase our columns, because  right below it, I want to write the pseudo-inverse. OK, you can make a  pretty darn good guess. If it was a proper diagonal matrix, invertible,  if there weren't any zeroes down here, if it was sigma one to sigma n,  then everybody knows what the inverse would be, the inverse would be one  over sigma one, down to one over s- but of course, I'll have to stop at  sigma r. And, it will be the rest, zeroes again, of course.</p> <p>And  now this one was m by n, and this one is meant to have a slightly  different, you know, transpose shape, n by m. They both have that rank  r.</p> <p>My idea is that the pseudo-inverse is the best -- is the closest I can come to an inverse.</p> <p>So  what is sigma times its pseudo-inverse? Can you multiply sigma by its  pseudo-inverse? Multiply that by that? What matrix do you get? They're  diagonal. Rectangular, of course. But of course, we're going to get  ones, R ones, and all the rest, zeroes. And the shape of that, this  whole matrix will be m by m.</p> <p>And suppose I did it in the other  order. Suppose I did sigma plus sigma. Why don't I do it right  underneath? in the opposite order? See, this matrix hasn't got a  left-inverse, it hasn't got a right-inverse, but every matrix has got a  pseudo-inverse. If I do it in the order sigma plus sigma, what do I get?  Square matrix, this is m by n, this is m by m, my result is going to m  by m -- is going to be n by n, and what is it? Those are diagonal  matrices, it's going to be ones, and then zeroes. It's not the same as  that, it's a different size -- it's a projection. One is a projection  matrix onto the column space, and this one is the projection matrix onto  the row space. That's the best that pseudo-inverse can do. So what the  pseudo-inverse does is, if you multiply on the left, you don't get the  identity, if you multiply on the right, you don't get the identity, what  you get is the projection. It brings you into the two good spaces, the  row space and column space.</p> <p>And it just wipes out the null space.</p> <p>So  that's what the pseudo-inverse of this diagonal one is, and then the  pseudo-inverse of A itself -- this is perfectly invertible. What's the  inverse of V transpose? Just another tiny bit of review. That's an  orthogonal matrix, and its inverse is V, good.</p> <p>This guy has got  all the trouble in it, all the null space is responsible for, so it  doesn't have a true inverse, it has a pseudo-inverse, and then the  inverse of U is U transpose, thanks. Or, of course, I could write U  inverse. So, that's the question of, how do you find the pseudo-inverse  -- so what statisticians do when they're in this -- so this is like the  case of where least squares breaks down because the rank is -- you don't  have full rank, and the beauty of the singular value decomposition is,  it puts all the problems into this diagonal matrix where it's clear what  to do.</p> <p>It's the best inverse you could think of is clear.</p> <p>You see there could be other -- I mean, we could put some stuff down here, it would multiply these zeroes.</p> <p>It  wouldn't have any effect, but then the good pseudo-inverse is the one  with no extra stuff, it's sort of, like, as small as possible.</p> <p>It has to have those to produce the ones.</p> <p>If  it had other stuff, it would just be a larger matrix, so this  pseudo-inverse is kind of the minimal matrix that gives the best result.  Sigma sigma plus being r ones.</p> <p>SK. so I guess I'm hoping --  pseudo-inverse, again, let me repeat what I said at the very beginning.  This pseudo-inverse, which appears at the end, which is in section seven  point four, and probably I did more with it here than I did in the  book. The word pseudo-inverse will not appear on an exam in this course,  but I think if you see this all will appear, because this is all what  the course was about, chapters one, two, three, four -- but if you see  all that, then you probably see, well, OK, the general case had both  null spaces around, and this is the natural thing to do. Yes.</p> <p>So, this is one way to find the pseudo-inverse.</p> <p>The  point of a pseudo-inverse, of computing a pseudo-inverse is to get some  factors where you can find the pseudo-inverse quickly. And this is,  like, the champion, because this is where we can invert those, and those  two, easily, just by transposing, and we know what to do with a  diagonal. OK, that's as much review, maybe -- let's have a five-minute  holiday in 18.06 and, I'll see you Wednesday, then, for the rest of this  course.</p>
