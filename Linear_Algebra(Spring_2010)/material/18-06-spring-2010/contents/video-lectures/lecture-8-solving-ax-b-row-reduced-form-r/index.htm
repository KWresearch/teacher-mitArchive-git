<p></p> <p>OK, when the camera says, we'll start.</p> <p>You want to give me a  signal? OK, this is lecture eight in linear algebra, and this is the  lecture where we completely solve linear equations.</p> <p>So Ax=b.  That's our goal. If it has a solution. It certainly can happen that  there is no solution. We have to identify that possibility by  elimination. And then if there is a solution we want to find out is  there only one solution or are -- is there a whole family of solutions,  and then find them all. OK. Can I use as an example the same matrix that  I had last time when we were looking for the null space.</p> <p>So the,  the matrix has rows 1 2 2 2, 2 4 6 8, and the third row -- you remember  the main point was the third row, 3 6 8 10, is the sum of row one plus  row two. In other words, if I add those left-hand sides, I get the third  left-hand side. So you can tell me right away what elimination is going  to discover about the right-hand sides. What's -- there is a condition  on b1, b2, and b3 for this system to have a solution. Most cases -- if I  took these numbers to be one -- 5, and 17, there would not be a  solution. In fact, if I took those first numbers to be 1 and 5, what is  the only b3 that would be OK? Six.</p> <p>If the left-hand -- if these left-hand sides add up to that, then B -- I need b1 plus b2 to equal b3.</p> <p>Let's just see how elimination discovers that.</p> <p>But we can see it coming, right? That if -- let me say it in other words.</p> <p>If some combination on the left-hand side gives all 0s then the same combination on the right-hand side must give 0.</p> <p>OK.  So let me take that example and write down instead of copying out all  the plus signs, let me write down the matrix. 1 2 2 2, 2 4 6 8, and that  6 3 8 10, where the third row is the sum of the first two rows. Now how  do we deal with the right-hand side? That's -- we want to do the same  thing to the right-hand side that we're doing to these rows on the left  side, so we just tack on the right-hand side as another vector, another  column.</p> <p>So this is the augmented matrix.</p> <p>It's, it's the matrix A with the vector b tacked on.</p> <p>In Matlab, that's all you would need to type. OK. So we do elimination on that.</p> <p>Can  we just do elimination quickly? The first pivot is fine, I subtract two  of this away from this, three of this away from this, so I have 1 2 2 2  b1.</p> <p>Two of those away will give me 0 0 2 and 4, and that was b2  minus two b1. I, I have to do the same thing to that third, that last  column.</p> <p>And then three of these away from this gave me 0 0 2 4 b3  minus three b1s. So that's the, that's elimination with the first  column completed.</p> <p>We move on. There's the first pivot still.</p> <p>Here is the second pivot. We're always remembering, now, these are then going to be the pivot columns.</p> <p>And  let me get the final result -- well, let me -- can I do it by eraser?  We're capable of subtracting this row from this row, just by -- that'll  knock this out completely and give me the row of 0s, and on the  right-hand side, when I subtract this away from this, what do I have? I  think I have b3 minus a b2, and I had minus three b1s.</p> <p>This is going to, it's going to be a minus a b1.</p> <p>Oh yeah that's exactly what I expect.</p> <p>So  now the -- what's the last equation? The last equation, this  represented by this zero row, that last equation is, says 0 equals b3  minus b2 minus b1. So that's the condition for solvability. That's the  condition on the right-hand side that we expected.</p> <p>It says that  b1+b2 has to match b3, and if our numbers happen to have been 1, 5, and 6  -- so let me take, suppose b is 1 5 6. That's an OK b.</p> <p>And when I  do this elimination, what will I have? The b1 will still be a 1. b2  would be 5 minus 2, this would be a 3. 5 -- my 6 minus 5 minus 1, this  will be -- this is the main point -- this will be a 0, thanks. OK.</p> <p>So the last equation is OK now. And I can proceed to solve the two equations that are really there with four unknowns.</p> <p>OK, I, I, I want to do that, so this, this b is OK.</p> <p>It  allows a solution. We're going to be, naturally, interested to keep  track what are the conditions on b that make the equation solvable. So  let me write down what we already see before I continue to solve it. Let  me first -- solvability, solvability. So which -- so this is the  condition on the right-hand sides.</p> <p>And what is that condition?  This is solvability always of Ax=b. So Ax=b is solvable -- well,  actually, we had an answer in the language of the column space. Can you  remind me what that answer is? That, that was like our answer from  earlier lecture. b had to be in the column space. Solvable if -- when --  exactly when b is in the column space of A.</p> <p>Right? That just  says that b has to be a combination of the columns, and of course that's  exactly what the equation is looking for.</p> <p>So that -- now I want  to answer it -- the same answer but in different language. Another way  to answer this -- if a combination of the rows of A gives the zero row,  and this was an example where it happened, some combination of the rows  of A produced the zero row -- then what's the requirement on b? Since  we're going to do the same thing to both sides of all equations -- the  same combination of the components of b has to give 0. Right? That's --  so if there's a combination of the rows that gives the zero row, then  the same combination of the entries of b must give 0.</p> <p>And this  isn't the zero row, that's the zero number. OK. Tthis is another way of  saying -- and it is not immediate, right, that these two statements are  equivalent. But somehow they must be, because they're both equivalent to  the solvability of the system. OK.</p> <p>So we've got this, this sort  of -- like question zero is, does the system have a solution? OK, I'll  come back to discuss that further.</p> <p>Let's go forward when it does. When there is a solution.</p> <p>And so what's our job now? Abstractly we sit back and we say, OK, there's a solution, finished.</p> <p>It exists. But we want to construct it.</p> <p>So  what's the algorithm, the sequence of steps to find the solution?  That's what I -- and of course the quiz and the final, I'm going to give  you a system Ax=b and I'm going to ask you for the solution, if there  is one. And so this algorithm that you want to follow. OK, let's see.</p> <p>So what's the -- so now to find the complete solution to Ax=b.</p> <p>OK. Let me start by finding one solution, one particular solution.</p> <p>I'm expecting that I can, because my system of equations now, that last equation is zero equals zero, so that's all fine.</p> <p>I  really have two equations -- actually I've got four unknowns, so I'm  expecting to find not only a solution but a whole bunch of them. But  let's just find one.</p> <p>So step one, a particular solution, x  particular. How do I find one particular solution? Well, let me tell you  how I, how I find it. So this is -- since there are lots of solutions,  you could have your own way to find a particular one. But this is a  pretty natural way. Set all free variables to zero.</p> <p>Since those free variables are the guys that can be anything, the most convenient choice is zero.</p> <p>And then solve Ax=b for the pivot variables.</p> <p>So  what does that mean in this example? Which are the free variables?  Which, which are the variables that we can assign freely and then  there's one and only one way to find the pivot variables? They're x2 and  -- so x2 is zero, because that's in a column without a pivot, the  second column has no pivot. And the -- what's the other one? The fourth,  x4 is zero.</p> <p>Because that, those are the, the free ones. Those  are in the columns with no pivots. So you see what my -- so when I knock  -- when x2 and x4 are zero, I'm left with the -- what I left with here?  I'm just left with -- see, now I'm not using the two free columns.</p> <p>I'm only using the pivot columns.</p> <p>So  I'm really left with x1 -- the first equation is just x1 and two x3s  should be the right-hand side, which we picked to be a one. And the  second equation is two x3s, as it happened, turned out to be, three. I  just write it again here with the x2 and the x4 knocked out, since we're  set them to zero. And you see that we're back in the normal case of  having back -- where back substitution will do it.</p> <p>So x3 is three halves, and then we go back up and x1 is one minus two x3. That's probably minus two.</p> <p>Good. So now we have the solution, x particular is the vector minus two zero three halves zero. OK, good.</p> <p>That's  one particular solution, and we should and could plug it into the  original system. Really if -- on the quiz, please, it's a good thing to  do. So we did all this, these, row operations, but this is supposed to  solve the original system, and I think it does. OK.</p> <p>So that's x particular which we've got.</p> <p>So that's like what's new today.</p> <p>The  particular solution comes -- first you check that you have zero equals  zero, so you're OK on the last equations. And then you set the free  variables to zero, solve for the pivot variables, and you've got a  particular solution, the particular solution that has zero free  variables.</p> <p>OK. Now -- but that's only one solution, and now I'm looking for all.</p> <p>So  how do I find the rest? The point is I can add on x -- anything out of  the null space. We know how to find the vectors in the null space --  because we did it last time, but I'll remind you what we got.</p> <p>And  then I'll add. So the final result will be that the complete solution  -- this is now the complete guy -- the complete solution is this one  particular solution plus any, any vector, all different vectors out of  the null space. xn, OK.</p> <p>Well why, why this pattern, because this  pattern shows up through all of mathematics, because it shows up  everywhere we have linear equations. Let me just put here the, the  reason. A xp, so that's x particular, so what does Ax particular give?  That gives the correct right-hand side b. And what does A times an x in  the null space give? Zero. So I add, and I put in parentheses. So xp  plus xn is b plus zero, which is b. So -- oh, what I saying? Let me just  say it in words. If I have one solution, I can add on anything in the  null space, because anything in the null space has a zero right-hand  side, and I still have the correct right-hand side B.</p> <p>So that's my system. That's my complete solution.</p> <p>Now let me write out what that will be for this example.</p> <p>So  in this example, x general, x complete, the complete solution, is x  particular, which is minus two zero three halves zero, with those zeroes  in the free variable, plus -- you remember there were the special  solutions in the null space that had a one in the free variables -- or  one and zero in the free variables, and then we filled in to find the  others? I've forgotten what they were, but maybe it was that. That was a  special solution, and then there was another special solution that had  that free variable zero and this free variable equal one, and I have to  fill those in. Let's see, can I remember how those fill in? Maybe this  was a minus two and this was a two, possibly? I think probably that's  right. I'm not -- yeah.</p> <p>Does that look write to you? I would have  to remember what are my equations. Can I, rather than go way back to  that board, let me remember the first equation was two x3 plus two x4  equaling zero now, because I'm looking for the guys in the null space.</p> <p>So  I set x4 to be one and the second equation, that I didn't copy again,  gave me minus two for this and then -- yeah, so I think that's right.</p> <p>Two minus four and two gives zero, check.</p> <p>OK.  Those were the special solutions. What do we do to get the complete  solution? How do I get the complete solution now? I multiply this by  anything, c1, say, and I multiply this by anything -- I take any  combination. Remember that's how we described the null space? The null  space consists of all combinations of -- so this is xn -- all  combinations of the special solutions.</p> <p>There were two special  solutions because there were two free variables. And we want to make  that count -- carefully now. Just while I'm up here.</p> <p>So there's,  that's what the -- that's the kind of answer I'm looking for. Is there a  constant multiplying this guy? Is there a free constant that multiplies  x particular? No way.</p> <p>Right? x particular solves A xp=b.</p> <p>I'm not allowed to multiply that by three.</p> <p>But Axn, I'm allowed to multiply xn by three, or add to another xn, because I keep getting zero on the right. OK.</p> <p>So, so again, xp is one particular guy.</p> <p>xn is a whole subspace. Right? It's one guy plus, plus anything from a subspace.</p> <p>Let me draw it. Let me try to -- oh. I want to draw, I want to graph all this -- I want to, I want to plot all solutions.</p> <p>Now x. So what dimension I in? This is a unfortunate point. How many components does x have? Four.</p> <p>There are four unknowns. So I have to draw a four dimensional picture on this MIT cheap blackboard.</p> <p>OK. So here we go.</p> <p>x1  -- Einstein could do it, but, this, this is -- those are four  perpendicular axes in -- representing four dimensional space. OK.</p> <p>Where are my solutions? Do my solutions form a subspace? Does the set of solutions to Ax=b form a subspace? No way.</p> <p>What  does it actually look like, though? A subspace is in this picture. This  part is a subspace, right? That part is some, like, two dimensional,  because I've got two parameters, so it's -- I'm thinking of this null  space as a two dimensional subspace inside R^4. Now I have to tell you  and will tell you next time, what does it mean to say a subspace, what's  the dimension of a subspace. But you see what it's going to be. It's  the number of free independent constants that we can choose.</p> <p>So  somehow there'll be a two dimensional subspace, not a line, and not a  three dimensional plane, but only a two dimensional guy. But it's  doesn't go through the origin because it goes through this point.</p> <p>So there's x particular. x particular is somewhere here.</p> <p>x  particular. So it's somehow a subspace -- can I try to draw it that  way? It's a two dimensional subspace that goes through x particular and  then onwards by -- so there's x particular, and I added on xn, and  there's x. There's x=xp+xn. But the xn was anywhere in this subspace, so  that filled out a plane. It's a subspace -- it's not a subspace, what I  saying? It's like a flat thing, it's like a subspace, but it's been  shifted, away from the origin. It doesn't contain zero. OK. Thanks.</p> <p>That's the picture, and that's the algorithm.</p> <p>So  the algorithm is just go through elimination and, find the particular  solution, and then find those special solutions. You can do that. Let me  take our time here in the lecture to think, about the bigger picture.  So let me think about -- so this is my pattern. Now I want to think -- I  want to ask you about a question -- I want to ask you some questions.</p> <p>So when I mean think bigger, I mean I'll think about an m by n matrix A of rank r. OK.</p> <p>What's our definition of rank? Our current definition of rank is number of pivots. OK.</p> <p>First  of all, how are these numbers related? Can you tell me a relation  between r and m? If I have m rows in the matrix and R pivots, -- then I  certainly know, always -- what relation do I know between r and m? r is  less or equal, right? Because I've got m rows, I can't have more than m  pivots, I might have m and I might have fewer.</p> <p>Also, I've got n  columns. So what's the relation between r and n? It's the same, less or  equal, because a column can't have more than one pivot. So I can't have  more than n pivots altogether. OK, OK.</p> <p>So I have an m by n matrix of rank r.</p> <p>And  I always know r less than or equal to m, r less than or equal to n. Now  I'm specially interested in the case of full rank, when the rank r is  as big as it can be. Well, I guess I've got two separate possibilities  here, depending on what these numbers m and n are. So let me talk about  the case of full column rank. And by that I mean r=n.</p> <p>And I want  to ask you, what does that imply about our solutions? What does that  tell us about the null space? What does that tell us about, the complete  solution? OK, so what does that mean? So I want to ask you, well, OK,  if the rank is n, what does that mean? That means there's a pivot in  every column. So how many pivot variables are there? n.</p> <p>All the  columns have pivots in this case. So how many free variables are there?  None at all. So no free variables. r=n, no free variables. So what does  that tell us about what's going to happen then in our, in our little  algorithms? What will be in the null space? The null space of A has got  what in it? Only the zero vector.</p> <p>There are no free variables to give other values to.</p> <p>So the null space is only the zero vector.</p> <p>And  what about our solution to Ax=b? Solution to Ax=b? What, what's the  story on that one? So now that's coming from today's lecture. The  solution x is -- what's the complete solution? It's just x particular,  right? If, if, if there is an x, if there is a solution. It's x equal x  particular.</p> <p>There's nothing -- you know, there's just one solution.</p> <p>If  there's one at all. So it's unique solution -- unique means only one --  unique solution if it exists, if it exists. In other words, I would say  -- let me put it a different way.</p> <p>There're either zero or one solutions.</p> <p>This  is all in this case r=n. So I'm -- because many, many applications in  reality, the columns will be what I'll later call independent. And we'll  have, nothing to look for in the null space, and we'll only have  particular solutions. OK.</p> <p>Everybody see that possibility? But I need an example, right? So let me create an example.</p> <p>What  sort of a matrix -- what's the shape of a matrix that has full column  rank? So can I squeeze in an, an example here? If it exists.</p> <p>Let  me put in an example, and it's just the right space to put in an  example. Because the example will be like tall and thin. It will have --  well, I mean, here's an example, one two six five, three one one one.  Brilliant example.</p> <p>OK. So there's a matrix A, and what's its  rank? What's the rank of that matrix? How many pivots will I find if I  do elimination? Two, right? Two. I see a pivot there -- oh certainly  those two columns are headed off in different directions.</p> <p>When I  do elimination, I'll certainly get another pivot here, fine, and I can  use those to clean out below and above. So the -- actually, tell me what  its row reduced row echelon form would be.</p> <p>Can you carry that,  that elimination process to the bitter end? So what do, what does that  mean? I subtract a multiple of this row from these rows. So I clean up,  all zeros there. Then I've got some pivot here.</p> <p>What do I do with  that? I go subtract it below and above, and then I divide through, and  what's R for that example? Maybe I can -- you'll allow me to put that  just here in the next board.</p> <p>What's the row reduced echelon form, just out of practice, for that matrix? It's got ones in the pivots.</p> <p>It's  got the identity matrix, a little two by two identity matrix, and below  it all zeros. That's a matrix that really has two independent rows, and  they're the first two, actually. The first two rows are independent.  They're not in the same direction. But the other rows are combinations  of the first two, so -- is there always a solution to Ax=b? Tell me  what's the picture here? For this matrix A, this is a case of full  column rank.</p> <p>The two columns are -- give two pivots.</p> <p>There's nothing in the null space.</p> <p>There's no combination of those columns that gives the zero column except the zero zero combination.</p> <p>So there's nothing in the null space.</p> <p>But is there always a solution to A X equal B? What's up with A X equal B? I've got four, four equations here, and only two Xs.</p> <p>So the answer is certainly no. There's not always a solution.</p> <p>I  may have zero solutions, and if I make a random choice, I'll have zero  solutions. Or if I make a great particular choice of the right-hand  side, which just happens to be a combination of those two guys -- like  tell me one right-hand side that would have a solution. Tell me a  right-hand side that would have a solution. Well, 0 0 0 0, OK. No prize  for that one.</p> <p>Tell me another one. Another right-hand side that  has a solution would be 4 3 7 6. I could add the two columns. Right?  What would be the total complete solution if the right-hand side was 4 3  7 6? There would be the particular solution one one, one of that column  plus one of that, and that would be the only solution. So there would  be -- x particular would be one one in the case when the right side is  the sum of those two columns, and that's it.</p> <p>So that would be a case with one solution.</p> <p>OK. That, this is the typical setup with full column rank. Now I go to full row rank.</p> <p>You see the sort of natural symmetry of this discussion.</p> <p>Full row rank means r=m. So this is what I'm interested in now, r=m. OK, what's up with that? How many pivots? m.</p> <p>So  what happens when we do elimination in that case? I'm going to get m  pivots. So every row has a pivot, right? Every row has a pivot.</p> <p>Then  what about solvability? What about this business of -- for which  right-hand sides can I solve it? So that's my question. I can solve Ax=b  for which right-hand sides? Do you see what's coming? I do elimination,  I don't get any zero rows.</p> <p>So there aren't any requirements on b.</p> <p>I  can solve Ax=b for every b. I can solve Ax=b for every right-hand side.  So this is the existence, exists a solution. Now tell me, so the, u- u-  so every row has a pivot in it.</p> <p>So how many free variables are  there? How many free variables in this case? If I had n variables to  start with, how many are used up by pivot variables? r, which is m. So  I'm left with, left with n-r free variables.</p> <p>OK. So this case of  full row rank I can always solve, and then this tells me how many  variables are free, and this is of course n-m. This is n-m free  variables. Can I do an example? You know, the best way for me to do an  example is just to transpose that example. So let me take, let me take  that matrix that had column one two six five and make it a row. And let  me take three one one one as the second row. And let me ask you, this is  my matrix A, what's its rank? What's the rank of that matrix? Sorry to  ask, but not sorry really, because we're just getting the idea of rank.  What's the rank of that matrix? Two, exactly, two.</p> <p>There will be  two pivots. What will the row reduced echelon form be? Anybody know that  one? Actually, tell me not only -- you have to tell me not only the,  there'll be two pivots but which will be the pivot columns.</p> <p>Which  columns of this matrix will be pivot columns? So the first column is  fine, and then I go on to the next column, and what do I get? Do I get a  second pivot out of -- will I get a second pivot in this position? Yes.</p> <p>So the pivots, when I get all the way to R, will be there. And here will be some numbers.</p> <p>This  is the part that I previously called F. This is the part that -- the  pivot columns in R will be the identity matrix. There are no zero rows,  no zero rows, because the rank is two.</p> <p>But there'll be stuff over here.</p> <p>And that will, enter the special solutions and the null space. OK.</p> <p>So this is a typical matrix with r=m smaller than n.</p> <p>Now finally I'vegotaspacehereforr=m=n.</p> <p>I'm off in the corner here with the most important case of all.</p> <p>So what's up with this matrix? So let me give an example.</p> <p>OK, brilliant example, 1 2 3 1.</p> <p>Tell  me what -- how do I describeamatrixthathasrankr=m=n? So the matrix is  square, right, it's a square matrix. And if I know its rank is -- it's  full rank, now.</p> <p>I don't have to say full column rank or full row  rank -- I just say full rank, because the count, column count and the  row count are the same, and the rank is as big as it can be.</p> <p>And  what kind of a matrix have I got? It's invertible.  Sothat'sexactlytheinvertiblematrices.r=m=n means the -- what's the row  echelon form, the reduced row echelon form, for an invertible matrix?  For a square, nice, square, invertible matrix? It's I. Right.</p> <p>So  you see that the, the good matrices are the ones that kind of come out  trivially in R. You reduce them all the way to the identity matrix.  What's the null space for this, for this matrix? Can I just hammer away  with questions? What's the null space for this matrix? The null space of  that matrix is the zero vector only.</p> <p>The zero vector only. What  are the conditions to solve Ax=b? Which right-hand sides b are OK? If I  want to solve Ax=b for this example, so A is this, b is b1 b2, what are  the conditions on b1 and b2? None at all, right.</p> <p>So this is the  case, this is the case where I can solve -- so I've coming back here, I  can -- since the rank equals m, I can solve for every b.</p> <p>And since the rank is also n, there's a unique solution.</p> <p>Let me summarize the whole picture here.</p> <p>Here's thewholepicture.Icouldhaver=m=n.</p> <p>This is the case where this is the identity matrix. And this is the case where there is one solution.</p> <p>That's  the square invertible chapter two case. Now we're into chapter three.  We could have r=m smaller than n. Now that's what we had over there, and  the row echelon form looked like the identity with some zero rows. And  that was the case where there are zero or one solution. When I say  solution I mean to Ax=b. So this case, there's always one. This case  there's zero or one.</p> <p>And now let me take the case of full column  rank, but some, extra rows. So now R has -- well, the identity -- I'm  almost tempted to write the identity matrix and then F, but that isn't  necessarily right. I have -- is that right? Am I getting this correct  here? Oh, I'm not! My God! This is the case R equals n, the columns, the  columns are, are OK. That's the case that was on that board, r=n, full  column rank.</p> <p>Now I want the case where m is smaller than n and I've got extra columns. OK.</p> <p>There  we go. So this is now the case of full row rank, and it looks like I F  except that I can't be sure that the pivot columns are the first  columns.</p> <p>So the I and the F, could be partly mixed into the I.  Can I write that with just like that? So the F could be sort of partly  into the I if the first columns weren't the pivot columns. Now how many  solutions in this case? There's always a solution.</p> <p>This is the existence case. There's always a solution. We're not getting any zero rows.</p> <p>There are no zero rows here. So there's always either one or infinitely many solutions. OK.</p> <p>Actually, I guess there's always an infinite number, because we always have some null space to deal with.</p> <p>Then the final case is where r is smaller than m and smaller than n. OK.</p> <p>Now that's the case where R is the identity with some free stuff but with some zero rows too.</p> <p>And  that's the case where there's either no solution -- because we didn't  get a zero equals zero for some bs, or infinitely many solutions. OK.</p> <p>Do you -- this board really summarizes the lecture, and this sentence summarizes the lecture.</p> <p>The rank tells you everything about the number of solutions.</p> <p>That number, the rank r, tells you all the information except the exact entries in the solutions.</p> <p>For that you go to the matrix. OK, good.</p> <p>Have a great weekend, and I'll see you on Monday.</p>
