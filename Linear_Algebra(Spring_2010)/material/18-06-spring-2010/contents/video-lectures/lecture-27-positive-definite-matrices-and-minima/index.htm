<p></p> <p>OK, this is the lecture on positive definite matrices.</p> <p>I made a start on those briefly in a previous lecture.</p> <p>One  point I wanted to make was the way that this topic brings the whole  course together, pivots, determinants, eigenvalues, and something new-  four plot instability and then something new in this expression, x  transpose Ax, actually that's the guy to watch in this lecture.</p> <p>So,  so the topic is positive definite matrix, and what's my goal? First,  first goal is, how can I tell if a matrix is positive definite? So I  would like to have tests to see if you give me a, a five by five matrix,  how do I tell if it's positive definite? More important is, what does  it mean? Why are we so interested in this property of positive  definiteness? And then, at the end comes some geometry. Ellipses are  connected with positive definite things. Hyperbolas are not connected  with positive definite things, so we- it's this, we, there's a geometry  too, but mostly it's linear algebra and -- this application of how do  you recognize 'em when you have a minim is pretty neat. OK. I'm gonna  begin with two by two.</p> <p>All matrices are symmetric, right? That's  understood; the matrix is symmetric, now my question is, is it positive  definite? Now, here are some -- each one of these is a complete test for  positive definiteness. If I know the eigenvalues, my test is are they  positive? Are they all positive? If I know these -- so, A is really -- I  look at that number A, here, as the, as the one by one determinant, and  here's the two by two determinant.</p> <p>So this is the determinant test.</p> <p>This  is the eigenvalue test, this is the determinant test. Are the  determinants growing in s- of all, of all end, sort of, can I call them  leading submatrices, they're the first ones the northwest, Seattle  submatrices coming down from from there, they all, all those  determinants have to be positive, and then another test is the pivots.</p> <p>The  pivots of a two by two matrix are the number A for sure, and, since the  product is the determinant, the second pivot must be the determinant  divided by A.</p> <p>And then in here is gonna come my favorite and my  new idea, the, the, the the one to catch, about x transpose Ax being  positive. But we'll have to look at this guy. This gets, like a star,  because for most, presentations, the definition of positive definiteness  would be this number four and these numbers one two three would be test  four. OK.</p> <p>Maybe I'll tuck this, where, you know, OK. So I'll  have to look at this x transpose Ax. Can you, can we just be sure, how  do we know that the eigenvalue test and the determinant test, pick out  the same matrices, and let me, let's just do a few examples.</p> <p>Some  examples. Let me pick the matrix two, six, six, tell me, what number do  I have to put there for the matrix to be positive definite? Tell me a  sufficiently large number that would make it positive definite? Let's  just practice with these conditions in the two by two case.</p> <p>Now,  when I ask you that, you don't wanna find the eigenvalues, you would use  the determinant test for that, so, the first or the pivot test, that,  that guy is certainly positive, that had to happen, and it's OK. How  large a number here -- the number had better be more than what? More  than eighteen, right, because if it's eight -- no. More than what?  Nineteen, is it? If I have a nineteen here, is that positive definite? I  get thirty eight minus thirty six, that's OK. If I had an eighteen, let  me play it really close. If I have an eighteen there, then I positive  definite? Not quite. I would call this guy positive, so it's useful just  to see that this the borderline. That matrix is on the borderline, I  would call that matrix positive semi-definite.</p> <p>And what are the  eigenvalues of that matrix, just since we're given eigenvalues of two by  twos, when it's semi-definite, but not definite, then the -- I'm  squeezing this eigenvalue test down, -- what's the eigenvalue that I  know this matrix has? What kind of a matrix have I got here? It's a  singular matrix, one of its eigenvalues is zero. That has an eigenvalue  zero, and the other eigenvalue is -- from the trace, twenty. OK.</p> <p>So  that, that matrix has eigenvalues greater than or equal to zero, and  it's that "equal to" that brought this word "semi-definite" in.</p> <p>And,  the what are the pivots of that matrix? So the pivots, so the  eigenvalues are zero and twenty, the pivots are, well, the pivot is two,  and what's the next pivot? There isn't one.</p> <p>We got a singular matrix here, it'll only have one pivot.</p> <p>You  see that that's a rank one matrix, two six is a -- six eighteen is a  multiple of two six, the matrix is singular it only has one pivot, so  the pivot test doesn't quite pass. The -- let me do the x transpose Ax.  Now this is -- the novelty now.</p> <p>OK. What I looking at when I look at this new combination, x transpose Ax.</p> <p>x is any vector now, so lemme compute, so any vector, lemme call its components x1 and x2, so that's x. And I put in here A.</p> <p>Let's, let's use this example two six, six eighteen, and here's x transposed, so x1 x2.</p> <p>We're  back to real matrices, after that last lecture that- that said what to  do in the complex case, let's come back to real matrices.</p> <p>So  here's x transpose Ax, and what I'm interested in is, what do I get if I  multiply those together? I get some function of x1 and x2, and what is  it? Let's see, if I do this multiplication, so I do it, lemme, just,  I'll just do it slowly, x1, x2, if I multiply that matrix, this is 2x1,  and 6x2s, and the next row is 6x1s and 18x2s, and now I do this final  step and what do I have? I've got 2x1 squareds, got 2X1 squareds is  coming from this two, I've got this one gives me eighteen, well, shall I  do the ones in the middle? How many x1 x2s do I have? Let's see, x1  times that 6x2 would be six of 'em, and then x2 times this one will be  six more, I get twelve.</p> <p>So, in here is going, this is the number  a, this is the number 2b, and in here is -- x2 times eighteen x2 will be  eighteen x2 squareds and this is the number c. So it's ax1 -- it's like  ax squared. 2bxy and cy squared. For my first point that I wanted to  make by just doing out a multiplication is, that is as soon as you give  me the matrix, as soon as you give me the matrix, I can -- those are the  numbers that appear in -- I'll call this thing a quadratic, you see,  it's not linear anymore.</p> <p>Ax is linear, but now I've got an x  transpose coming in, I'm up to degree two, up to degree two, maybe  quadratic is the -- use the word.</p> <p>A quadratic form. It's purely  degree two, there's no linear part, there's no constant part, there  certainly no cubes or fourth powers, it's all second degree. And my  question is -- is that quantity positive or not? That's -- for every x1  and x2, that is my new definition -- that's my definition of a positive  definite matrix. If this quantity is positive, if, if, if, it's positive  for all x's and y's, all x1 x2s, then I call them -- then that's the  matrix is positive definite. Now, is this guy passing our test? Well we  have, we anticipated the answer here by, by asking first about  eigenvalues and pivots, and what happened? It failed. It barely failed.</p> <p>If  I had made this eighteen down to a seven, it would've totally failed. I  do that with the eraser, and then I'll put back eighteen, because,  seven is such a total disaster, but if -- I'll keep seven for a second.  Is that thing in any way positive definite? No, absolutely not.</p> <p>I  don't know its eigenvalues, but I know for sure one of them is  negative. Its pivots are two and then the next pivot would be the  determinant over two, and the determinant is -- what, what's the  determinant of this thing? Fourteen minus thirty six, I've got a  determinant minus twenty two.</p> <p>The next pivot will be -- the pivots now, of this thing are two and minus eleven or something.</p> <p>Their product being minus twenty two the determinant.</p> <p>This thing is not positive definite.</p> <p>What would be -- let me look at the x transpose Ax for this guy.</p> <p>What's  -- if I do out this multiplication, this eighteen is temporarily  changing to a seven. This eighteen is temporarily changing to a seven,  and I know that there's some numbers x1 and x2 for which that thing,  that function, is negative.</p> <p>And I'm desperately trying to think what they are.</p> <p>Maybe  you can see. Can you tell me a value of x1 and x2 that makes this  quantity negative? Oh, maybe one and minus one? Yes, that's -- in this  case, that, will work, right, if I took x1 to be one, and x2 to be minus  one, then I always get something positive, the two, and the seven minus  one squared, but this would be minus twelve and the whole thing would  be negative; I would have two minus twelve plus seven, a negative. If I  drew the graph, can I get the little picture in here? If I draw the  graph of this thing? So, graphs, of the function f(x,y), or f(x), so I  say here f(x,y) equal this -- x transpose Ax, this, this this ax  squared, 2bxy, and cy squared.</p> <p>And, let's take the example, with these numbers.</p> <p>OK, so here's the x axis, here's the y axis, and here's -- up is the function.</p> <p>z,  if you like, or f. I apologize, and let me, just once in my life here,  put an arrow over these, these, axes so you see them. That's the vector  and I just, see, instead of x1 and x2, I made them x- the components x  and y. OK.</p> <p>So, so, what's a graph of 2x squared, twelve xy, and  seven y squared? I'd like to see -- I not the greatest artist, but let's  -- tell me something about this graph of this function. Whoa, tell me  one point that it goes through.</p> <p>The origin. Right? Even this  artist can get this thing to go through the origin, when these are zero,  I, I certainly get zero. OK.</p> <p>Some more points. If x is one and y  is zero, then I'm going upwards, so I'm going up this way, and I'm, I'm  going up, like, two x squared in that direction. So -- that's meant to  be a parabola. And, suppose x stays zero and y increases. Well, y could  be positive or negative; it's seven y squared. Is this function going  upward? In the x direction it's going upward, and in the y direction  it's going upwards, and if x equals y then the forty-five degree  direction is certainly going upwards; because then we'd have what,  about, everything would be positive, but what? This function -- what's  the graph of this function? Look like? Tell me the word that describes  the graph of this function. This is the non-positive definite here,  everybody's with me here, for some reason got started in a negative  direction, your case that isn't positive definite.</p> <p>And what's the  graph look like that goes up, but does it -- do we have a minimum here,  does it go from, from the origin? Completely? No, because we just  checked that this thing failed. It failed along the direction when x was  minus y -- we have a saddle point, let me put myself, let me, to the  least, tell you the word. This thing, goes up in some directions, but  down in other directions, and if we actually knew what a saddle looked  like or thinks saddles do that -- the way your legs go is, like, down,  up, the way, you, looking like, forward, and, the, and drawing the thing  is even worse than describing -- I'm just going to say in some  directions we go up and in other directions, there is, a saddle -- Now  I'm sorry I put that on the front board, you have no way to cover it,  but it's a saddle.</p> <p>OK. And, and this is a saddle point, it's the,  it's the point that's at the maximum in some directions and at the  minimum in other directions. And actually, the perfect directions to  look are the eigenvector directions.</p> <p>We'll see that. So this is, not a positive definite matrix. OK.</p> <p>Now I'm coming back to this example, getting rid of this seven, let's move it up to twenty.</p> <p>Let's, let's let's make the thing really positive definite.</p> <p>OK. So this is, this number's now twenty. c is now twenty.</p> <p>OK.  Now that passes the test, which I haven't proved, of course, it passes  the test for positive pivots. It passes the test for positive  eigenvalues. How can you tell that the eigenvalues of that matrix are  positive without actually finding them? Of course, two by two I could  find them, but can you see -- how do I know they're positive? I know  that their product is -- I know that lambda one times lambda two is  positive, why? Because that's the determinant, right, lambda one times  lambda two is the determinant, which is forty minus thirty-six is four.  So the determinant is four.</p> <p>And the trace, the sum down the diagonal, is twenty-two. So, they multiply to give four.</p> <p>So  that leaves the possibility they're either both positive or both  negative. But if they're both negative, the trace couldn't be  twenty-two.</p> <p>So they're both positive. So both of the eigenvalues  that are positive, both of the pivots are positive -- the determinants  are positive, and I believe that this function is positive everywhere  except at zero, zero, of course. When I write down this condition, So I  believe that x transposed, let me copy, x transpose Ax is positive,  except, of course, at the minimum point, at zero, of course, I don't  expect miracles.</p> <p>So what does its graph look like, and how do I  check, and how do I check that this really is positive? So we take it's  graph for a minute.</p> <p>What would be the graph of that function --  it does not have a saddle point. Let me -- I'll raise the board, here,  and stay with this example for a while.</p> <p>So I want to do the graph  of -- here's my function, two x squared, twelve xy-s, that could be  positive or negative, and twenty y squared. But my point is, so you're  seeing the underlying point is, that, the things are positive definite  when in some way, these, these pure squares, squares we know to be  positive, and when those kind of overwhelm this guy, who could be m-  positive or negative, because some like or have same or have same or  different signs, when these are big enough they overwhelm this guy and  make the total thing positive, and what would the graph now look like?  Let me draw the x - well, let me draw the x direction, the y direction,  and the origin, at zero, zero, I'm there, where do I go as I move away  from the origin? Where do I go as I move away from the origin? I'm sure  that I go up.</p> <p>The origin, the center point here, is a minim  because this thing I believe, and we better see why, it's, the graph is  like a bowl, the graph is like a bowl shape, it's -- here's the minimum.</p> <p>And  because we've got a pure quadratic, we know it sits at the origin, we  know it's tangent plane, the first derivatives are zero, so, we know,  first derivatives, First derivatives are all zero, but that's not enough  for a minimum. It's first derivatives were zero here. So, the partial  derivatives, the first derivatives, are zero.</p> <p>Again, because first derivatives are gonna have an x or an a y, or a y in them, they'll be zero at the origin.</p> <p>It's  the second derivatives that control everything. It's the second  derivatives that this matrix is telling us, and somehow -- here's my  point.</p> <p>You remember in Calculus, how did you decide on a minimum? First requirement was, that the derivative had to be zero.</p> <p>But  then you didn't know if you had a minimum or a maximum. To know that  you had a minimum, you had to look at the second derivative. The second  derivative had to be positive, the slope had to be increasing as you  went through the minimum point.</p> <p>The curvature had to go upwards,  and that's what we're doing now in two dimensions, and in n dimensions.  So we're doing what we did in Calculus. Second derivative positive, m-  will now become that the matrix of second derivatives is positive  definite. Can I just -- like a translation of -- this is how minimum are  coming in, ithe beginning of Calculus -- we had a minimum was  associated with second derivative, being positive.</p> <p>And first derivative zero, of course.</p> <p>Derivative, first derivative, but it was the second derivative that told us we had a minimum.</p> <p>And  now, in 18.06, in linear algebra, we'll have a minim for our function  now, our function will have, for your function be a function not of just  x but several variables, the way functions really are in real life, the  minimum will be when the matrix of second derivatives, the matrix here  was one by one, there was just one second derivative, now we've got  lots. Is positive definite. So positive for a number translates into  positive definite for a matrix.</p> <p>And it this brings everything you  check pivots, you check determinants, you check all your values, or you  check this minimum stuff.</p> <p>OK. Let me come back to this graph.</p> <p>That graph goes upwards. And I'll have to see why.</p> <p>How  do I know that this, that this function is always positive? Can you  look at that and tell that it's always positive? Maybe two by two, you  could feel pretty sure, but what's the good way to show that this thing  is always positive? If we can express it, as, in terms of squares,  because that's what we know for any x and y, whatever, if we're squaring  something we certainly are not negative.</p> <p>So I believe that this  expression, this function, could be written as a sum of squares. Can you  tell me -- see, because all the problems, the headaches are coming from  this xy term.</p> <p>If we can get expressions -- if we can get that  inside a square, so actually, what we're doing is something called, that  you've seen called completing the square.</p> <p>Let me start the square and you complete it.</p> <p>OK,  I think we have two of x plus, now I don't remember how many y-s we  need, but you'll figure it out, squared. How many y-s should I put in  here, to make -- what do I want to do, the two x squared-s will be  correct, right? What I want to do is put in the right number of y-s to  get the twelve xy correct. And what is that number of y-s? Let's see,  I've got two times, and so I really want six xy-s to come out of here, I  think maybe if I put three there, does that look right to you? I have  two- this is, we can mentally, multiply out, that's X squared, that's  right, that's six X Y, times the two gives from, right, and how many Y  squareds have I now got? How many Y squareds have I now got from this  term? Eighteen. Eighteen was the key number, remember? Now if I want to  make it twenty, then I've got two left.</p> <p>Two y squared-s. That's  completing the square, and it's, now I can see that that function is  positive, because it's all squares. I've got two squares, added  together, I couldn't go negative. What if I went back to that seven? If  instead of twenty that number was a seven, then what would happen? This  would still be correct, I'd still have this square, to get the two x  squared and the twelve xy, and I'd have eighteen y squared and then what  would I do here? I'd have to remove eleven y squared-s, right, if I  only had a seven here, then instead of -- when I had a twenty I had two  more to put in, when I had an eighteen, which was the marginal case, I  had no more to put in.</p> <p>When I had a seven, which was the case  below zero, the indefinite case, I had minus eleven. OK. Now, so, you  can see now, that this thing is a bowl. It's going upwards, if I cut it  at a plane, z equal to one, say, I would get, I would get a curve, what  would be the equation for that curve? If I cut it at height one, the  equation would be this thing equal to one. And that curve would be an  ellipse. So actually, already, I've blocked into the lecture, the  different pieces that we're aiming for. We're aiming for the tests,  which this passed; we're aiming for the connection to a minimum, which  this -- which we see in the graph, and if we chop it up, if we set this  thing equal to one, if I set that thing equal to one, that -- what that  gives me is, the cross-section.</p> <p>It gives me this, this curve, and its equation is this thing equals one, and that's an ellipse.</p> <p>Whereas if I cut through a saddle point, I get a hyperbola. OK.</p> <p>But this minimum stuff is really what I'm most interested in. OK.</p> <p>By  -- I just have to ask, do you recognize, I mean, these numbers here,  the two that appeared outside, the three that appeared inside, the two  that appeared there -- actually, those numbers come from elimination.</p> <p>Completing the square is our good old method of Gaussian elimination, in expressed in terms of these squares.</p> <p>The -- let me show you what I mean.</p> <p>I  just think those numbers are no accident, If I take my matrix two, six,  six, and twenty, and I do elimination, then the pivot is two and I take  three, what's the multiplier? How much of row one do I take away from  row two? Three. So what you're seeing in this, completing the square, is  the pivots outside and the multiplier inside. Just do that again? The  pivot is two, three -- three of those away from that gives me two, six,  zero, and what's the second pivot? Three of this away from this, three  sixes'll be eighteen, and the second pivot will also be a two.</p> <p>So  that's the U, this is the A, and of course the L was one, zero, one,  and the multiplier was three. So, completing the square is elimination.  Why I happy to see, happy to see that coming together? Because I know  about elimination for m by m matrices. I just started talking about  completing the square, here, for two by twos.</p> <p>But now I see  what's going on. Completing the square really amounts to splitting this  thing into a sum of squares, so what's the critical thing -- I have a  lot of squares, and inside those squares are multipliers but they're  squares, and the question is, what's outside these squares? When I  complete the square, what are the numbers that go outside? They're the  pivots.</p> <p>They're the pivots, and that's why positive pivots give  me sum of squares. Positive pivots, those pivots are the numbers that go  outside the squares, so positive pivots, sum of squares, everything  positive, graph goes up, a minimum at the origin, it's all connected  together; all connected together. And in the two by two case, you can  see those connections, but linear algebra now can go up to three by  three, m by m. Let's do that next.</p> <p>Can I just, before I leave two  by two, I've written this expression "matrix of second derivatives."  What's the matrix of second derivatives? That's one second derivative  now, but if I'm in two dimensions, I have a two by two matrix, it's the  second x derivative, the second x derivative goes there -- shall I write  it -- fxx, if you like, fxx, that means the second derivative of f in  the x direction.</p> <p>fyy, second derivative in the y direction.</p> <p>Those are the pure derivatives, second derivatives.</p> <p>They have to be positive. For a minimum.</p> <p>This number has to be positive for a minimum.</p> <p>That  number has to be positive for a minimum. But, that's not enough. Those  numbers have to somehow be big enough to overcome this cross-derivative,  Why is the matrix symmetric? Because the second derivative f with  respect to x and y is equal to -- I can, that's the beautiful fact about  second derivatives, is I can do those in either order and I get the  same thing.</p> <p>So this is the same as that, and so, that's the  matrix of second derivatives. And the test is, it has to be positive  definite. You might remember, from, tucked in somewhere near the end of  eighteen o' two or at least in the book, was the condition for a  minimum, For a function of two variables. Let's -- when do you have a  minimum? For a function of two variables, believe me, that's what  Calculus is for. The condition is first derivatives have to be zero. And  the matrix of second derivatives has to be positive definite.</p> <p>So  you maybe remember there was an fxx times an fyy that had to be bigger  than an an fxy squared, that's just our determinant, two by two.</p> <p>But  now, we now know the answer for three by three, m by m, because we can  do elimination by m by m matrices, we can connect eigenvalues of m by m  matrices, we can do sum of squares, sum of m squares instead of only two  squares; and so let's take a, let me go over here to do a three by  three example.</p> <p>So, three by three example. OK.</p> <p>Oh, let me  -- shall I use my favorite matrix? You've seen this matrix before. Yes,  let's use the good matrix, four by one, oops, open.</p> <p>Is that  matrix positive definite? What's -- so I'm going to ask questions about  this matrix, is it positive definite, first of all? What's the function  associated with that matrix, what's the x transpose Ax? Is -- do we have  a minimum for that function, at zero? And then even what's the  geometry? OK. First of all, is the matrix positive definite, now I've  given you the numbers there so you can take the determinants, maybe  that's the quickest, is that what you would do mentally, if I give you  all a matrix on a quiz and say is it positive definite or not? I would  take that determinant and I'd give the answer two.</p> <p>I would take  that determinant and I would give the answer for that two by two  determinant, I'd give the answer three, and anybody remember the answer  for the three by three determinant? It was four, you remember for these  special matrices, when we do determinants, they went up two, three,  four, five, six, they just went up linearly. So that matrix has -- the  determinants are two, three, and four.</p> <p>Pivots. What are the  pivots for that matrix? I'll tell you, they're -- the first pivot is  two, the next pivot is three over two, the next pivot is four over  three.</p> <p>Because, the product of the pivots has to give me those  determinants. The product of these two pivots gives me that determinant;  the product of all the pivots gives me that determinant.</p> <p>What are the eigenvalues? Oh, I don't know.</p> <p>The  eigenvalues I've got, what do I have a cubic equation -- a degree three  equation? There are three eigenvalues to find. If I believe what I've  said today, what do I know about these eigenvalues, even though I don't  know the exact numbers. I -- I remember the numbers.</p> <p>Because  these matrices are so important that people figure them. But -- what do  you believe to be true about these three eigenvalues -- you believe that  they are all positive. They're all positive.</p> <p>I think that they are two minus square root of two, two, and two plus the square root of two.</p> <p>I  think. Let me just -- I can't write those numbers down without checking  the simple checks, what the first simple check is the trace, so if I  add those numbers I get six and if I add those numbers I get six. The  other simple test is the determinant, if I -- can you do this, can you  multiply those numbers together? I guess we can multiply by two out  there. What's two minus square root of two times two plus square root of  two, that'll be four minus two, that'll be two, yeah, two times two,  that's got the determinant, right, so it's got, it's got a chance of  being correct and I think it is. Now, what's the x transpose Ax? I  better give myself enough room for that. x transpose Ax for this guy.</p> <p>It's  two x1 squareds, and two x2 squareds, and two x3 squareds. Those come  from the diagonal, those were easy. Now off the diagonal there's a minus  and a minus, they come together there'll be a minus two minus two  whats? Are coming from this one two and two one position, is the x1 x2.  I'm doing mentally a multiplication of this matrix times a row vector on  the left times a column vector on the right, and I know that these  numbers show up in the answer. The diagonal is the perfect square, this  off diagonal is a minus two x1 x2, and there are no x1 x3-s, and  there're minus two x2 x3-s.</p> <p>And I believe that that expression is  always positive. I believe that that curve, that graph, really, of that  function, this is my function f, and I'm in more dimensions now than I  can draw, it -- but the graph of that function goes upwards.</p> <p>It's  a bowl. Or maybe the right word is -- just forgot, what's a long word  for bowl? Hm, maybe paraboloid, I think, paraboloid comes in.</p> <p>I'll edit the tape and get that word in.</p> <p>Bowl,  let's say, is, that, so that, and if I can -- I could complete the  squares, I could write that as the sum of three squares, and those three  squares would get multiplied by the three pivots. And the pivots are  all positive. So I would have positive pivots times squares, the net  result would be a positive function and a bowl which goes upwards.</p> <p>And  then, finally, if I cut -- if I slice through this bowl, if I -- now  I'm asking you to stretch your visualization here, because I'm in four  dimensions, I've got x1 x2 x3 in the base, and this function is z, or f,  or something. And its graph is going up. But I'm in four dimensions,  because I've got three in the base and then the upward direction, but  now if I cut through this four-dimensional picture, at level one, so,  suppose I cut through this thing at height one.</p> <p>So I take all the points that are at height one.</p> <p>That  gives me -- it gave me an ellipse over there, in that two by two case,  in this case, this will be the equation of an ellipsoid, a football in  other words. Well, not quite a football.</p> <p>A lopsided football.  What would be, can I try to describe to you what the ellipsoid will look  like, this ellipsoid, I'm sorry that the, that I've ended the matrix  right -- at the point, let's -- let me be sure you've seen the equation.</p> <p>Two  x1 squared, two x2 squared, two x3 squared, minus two of the cross  parts, equal what? That is the equation of a football, so what do I mean  by a football or an ellipsoid? I mean that, well, I'll draw a few.</p> <p>It's like that, it's got a center, and it's got it's got three principal directions.</p> <p>This ellipsoid. So -- you see what I'm saying, if we have a sphere then all directions would be the same.</p> <p>If  we had a true football, or it's closer to a rugby ball, really, because  it's more curved than a football, it would have one long direction and  the other two would be equal. That would be like having a matrix that  had one eigenvalue repeated.</p> <p>And then one other different. So this sphere comes from, like, the identity matrix, all eigenvalues the same.</p> <p>Our  rugby ball comes from a case where -- three, the three, two of the  three eigenvalues are the same. But we know how the case where -- the  typical case, where the three eigenvalues were all different. So this  will have -- How do I say it, if I look at this ellipsoid correctly,  it'll have a major axis, it'll have a middle axis, and it'll have a  minor axis. And those three axes will be in the direction of the  eigenvectors. And the lengths of those axes will be determined by the  eigenvalues. I can get -- turn this all into linear algebra, because we  have -- the right thing we know about eigenvectors and eigenvalues, for  that matrix is what? Of -- let me just tell you that, repeat the main  linear algebra point.</p> <p>How could we turn what I said into algebra;  we would write this A as Q, the eigenvector matrix, times lambda, the  eigenvalue matrix times Q transposed. The principal axis theorem, we'll  call it, now.</p> <p>The eigenvectors tell us the directions of the  principal axes. The eigenvalues tell us the lengths of those axes,  actually the lengths, or the half-lengths, or one over the eigenvalues,  it turns out. And that is the matrix factorization which is the most  important matrix factorization in our eigenvalue material so far.</p> <p>That's diagonalization for a symmetric matrix, so instead of the inverse I can write the transposed.</p> <p>OK.  I've -- so what I've tried today is to tell you the -- what's going on  with positive definite matrices. Ah, you see all how all these pieces  are there and linear algebra connects them.</p> <p>OK. See you on Friday.</p>
