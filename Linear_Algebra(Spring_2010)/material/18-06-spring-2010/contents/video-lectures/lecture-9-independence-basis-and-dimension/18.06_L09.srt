1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:05
OK, this is linear algebra
lecture nine.

2
00:00:05 --> 00:00:11
And this is a key lecture,
this is where we get these

3
00:00:11 --> 00:00:18
ideas of linear independence,
when a bunch of vectors are

4
00:00:18 --> 00:00:24
independent -- or dependent,
that's the opposite.

5
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
The space they span.

6
00:00:27 --> 00:00:33.65
A basis for a subspace or a
basis for a vector space,

7
00:00:33.65 --> 00:00:37.85
that's a central idea.

8
00:00:37.85 --> 00:00:42
And then the dimension of that
subspace.

9
00:00:42 --> 00:00:47
So this is the day that those
words get assigned clear

10
00:00:47 --> 00:00:48
meanings.

11
00:00:48 --> 00:00:54.91
And emphasize that we talk
about a bunch of vectors being

12
00:00:54.91 --> 00:00:56
independent.

13
00:00:56 --> 00:01:02
Wouldn't talk about a matrix
being independent.

14
00:01:02 --> 00:01:05
A bunch of vectors being
independent.

15
00:01:05 --> 00:01:08
A bunch of vectors spanning a
space.

16
00:01:08 --> 00:01:11
A bunch of vectors being a
basis.

17
00:01:11 --> 00:01:14
And the dimension is some
number.

18
00:01:14 --> 00:01:17
OK, so what are the
definitions?

19
00:01:17 --> 00:01:21
Can I begin with a fact,
a highly important fact,

20
00:01:21 --> 00:01:27
that, I didn't call directly
attention to earlier.

21
00:01:27 --> 00:01:32
Suppose I have a matrix and I
look at Ax equals zero.

22
00:01:32 --> 00:01:38
Suppose the matrix has a lot of
columns, so that n is bigger

23
00:01:38 --> 00:01:39
than m.

24
00:01:39 --> 00:01:43
So I'm looking at n equations
-- I mean, sorry,

25
00:01:43 --> 00:01:47
m equations,
a small number of equations m,

26
00:01:47 --> 00:01:49
and more unknowns.

27
00:01:49 --> 00:01:53
I have more unknowns than
equations.

28
00:01:53 --> 00:01:56
Let me write that down.

29
00:01:56 --> 00:02:00
More unknowns than equations.

30
00:02:00 --> 00:02:03
More unknown x-s than
equations.

31
00:02:03 --> 00:02:10
Then the conclusion is that
there's something in the null

32
00:02:10 --> 00:02:16
space of A, other than just the
zero vector.

33
00:02:16 --> 00:02:23
The conclusion is there are
some non-zero x-s such that Ax

34
00:02:23 --> 00:02:24
is zero.

35
00:02:24 --> 00:02:28.26
There are some special
solutions.

36
00:02:28.26 --> 00:02:29.25
And why?

37
00:02:29.25 --> 00:02:32.47
We know why.

38
00:02:32.47 --> 00:02:36
I mean, it sort of like seems
like a reasonable thing,

39
00:02:36 --> 00:02:41
more unknowns than equations,
then it seems reasonable that

40
00:02:41 --> 00:02:43
we can solve them.

41
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
But we have a,
a clear algorithm which starts

42
00:02:46 --> 00:02:51
with a system and does
elimination, gets the thing into

43
00:02:51 --> 00:02:55.62
an echelon form with some pivots
and pivot columns,

44
00:02:55.62 --> 00:03:01
and possibly some free columns
that don't have pivots.

45
00:03:01 --> 00:03:09
And the point is here there
will be some free columns.

46
00:03:09 --> 00:03:17
The reason, so the reason is
there must -- there will be free

47
00:03:17 --> 00:03:21
variables, at least one.

48
00:03:21 --> 00:03:24
That's the reason.

49
00:03:24 --> 00:03:30
That we now have this --
a complete, algorithm,

50
00:03:30 --> 00:03:36
a complete systematic way to
say, OK, we take the system Ax

51
00:03:36 --> 00:03:41
equals zero, we row reduce,
we identify the free variables,

52
00:03:41 --> 00:03:46
and, since there are n
variables and at most m pivots,

53
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
there will be some free
variables, at least one,

54
00:03:50 --> 00:03:54
at least n-m in fact,
left over.

55
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
And those variables I can
assign non-zero values to.

56
00:03:57 --> 00:04:00
I don't have to set those to
zero.

57
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
I can take them to be one or
whatever I like,

58
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
and then I can solve for the
pivot variables.

59
00:04:06 --> 00:04:09
So then it gives me a solution
to Ax equals zero.

60
00:04:09 --> 00:04:12
And it's a solution that isn't
all zeros.

61
00:04:12 --> 00:04:19
So, that's an important point
that we'll use now in this

62
00:04:19 --> 00:04:20
lecture.

63
00:04:20 --> 00:04:27
So now I want to say what does
it mean for a bunch of vectors

64
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
to be independent.

65
00:04:29 --> 00:04:29
OK.

66
00:04:29 --> 00:04:35
So this is like the background
that we know.

67
00:04:35 --> 00:04:42
Now I want to speak about
independence.

68
00:04:42 --> 00:04:42
OK.

69
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
Let's see.

70
00:04:44 --> 00:04:53
I can give you the abstract
definition, and I will,

71
00:04:53 --> 00:05:02
but I would also like to give
you the direct meaning.

72
00:05:02 --> 00:05:08.86
So the question is,
when vectors x1,

73
00:05:08.86 --> 00:05:15
x2 up to --
Suppose I have n vectors are

74
00:05:15 --> 00:05:16
independent if.

75
00:05:16 --> 00:05:22.5
Now I have to give you -- or
linearly independent -- I'll

76
00:05:22.5 --> 00:05:27
often just say and write
independent for short.

77
00:05:27 --> 00:05:27
OK.

78
00:05:27 --> 00:05:30
I'll give you the full
definition.

79
00:05:30 --> 00:05:35
These are just vectors in some
vector space.

80
00:05:35 --> 00:05:39
I can take combinations of
them.

81
00:05:39 --> 00:05:45
The question is,
do any combinations give zero?

82
00:05:45 --> 00:05:52
If some combination of those
vectors gives the zero vector,

83
00:05:52 --> 00:05:58
other than the combination of
all zeros, then they're

84
00:05:58 --> 00:05:59
dependent.

85
00:05:59 --> 00:06:06
They're independent if no
combination gives the zero

86
00:06:06 --> 00:06:14
vector -- and then I have,
I'll have to put in an except

87
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
the zero combination.

88
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
So what do I mean by that?

89
00:06:20 --> 00:06:25
No combination gives the zero
vector.

90
00:06:25 --> 00:06:33
Any combination c1 x1+c2 x2
plus, plus cn xn is not zero

91
00:06:33 --> 00:06:37
except for the zero combination.

92
00:06:37 --> 00:06:44
This is when all the c-s,
all the c-s are zero.

93
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
Then of course.

94
00:06:46 --> 00:06:49
That combination -- I know I'll
get zero.

95
00:06:49 --> 00:06:53
But the question is,
does any other combination give

96
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
zero?

97
00:06:54 --> 00:06:57.57
If not, then the vectors are
independent.

98
00:06:57.57 --> 00:07:02
If some other combination does
give zero, the vectors are

99
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
dependent.

100
00:07:04 --> 00:07:04.33
OK.

101
00:07:04.33 --> 00:07:06
Let's just take examples.

102
00:07:06 --> 00:07:11
Suppose I'm in,
say, in two dimensional space.

103
00:07:11 --> 00:07:12
OK.

104
00:07:12 --> 00:07:18
I give you -- I'd like to first
take an example -- let me take

105
00:07:18 --> 00:07:25
an example where I have a vector
and twice that vector.

106
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
So that's two vectors,
V and 2V.

107
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
Are those dependent or
independent?

108
00:07:30 --> 00:07:34
Those are dependent for sure,
right, because there's one

109
00:07:34 --> 00:07:36
vector is twice the other.

110
00:07:36 --> 00:07:41.15
One vector is twice as long as
the other, so if the word

111
00:07:41.15 --> 00:07:45
dependent means anything,
these should be dependent.

112
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
And they are.

113
00:07:47 --> 00:07:51
And in fact,
I would take two of the first

114
00:07:51 --> 00:07:54
-- so here's,
here is a vector V and the

115
00:07:54 --> 00:07:59
other guy is a vector 2V,
that's my -- so there's a

116
00:07:59 --> 00:08:03
vector V1 and my next vector V2
is 2V1.

117
00:08:03 --> 00:08:08.42
Of course those are dependent,
because two of these first

118
00:08:08.42 --> 00:08:13
vectors minus the second vector
is zero.

119
00:08:13 --> 00:08:18
That's a combination of these
two vectors that gives the zero

120
00:08:18 --> 00:08:18
vector.

121
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20.12
OK, that was clear.

122
00:08:20.12 --> 00:08:24
Suppose, suppose I have a
vector -- here's another

123
00:08:24 --> 00:08:24
example.

124
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
It's easy example.

125
00:08:26 --> 00:08:30
Suppose I have a vector and the
other guy is the zero vector.

126
00:08:30 --> 00:08:36
Suppose I have a vector V1 and
V2 is the zero vector.

127
00:08:36 --> 00:08:40
Then are those vectors
dependent or independent?

128
00:08:40 --> 00:08:42
They're dependent again.

129
00:08:42 --> 00:08:46
You could say,
well, this guy is zero times

130
00:08:46 --> 00:08:47
that one.

131
00:08:47 --> 00:08:51
This one is some combination of
those.

132
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
But let me write it the other
way.

133
00:08:54 --> 00:08:58
Let me say --
what combination,

134
00:08:58 --> 00:09:03
how many V1s and how many V2s
shall I take to get the zero

135
00:09:03 --> 00:09:03
vector?

136
00:09:03 --> 00:09:08
If, if V1 is like the vector
two one and V2 is the zero

137
00:09:08 --> 00:09:12
vector, zero zero,
then I would like to show that

138
00:09:12 --> 00:09:16
some combination of those gives
the zero vector.

139
00:09:16 --> 00:09:18
What shall I take?

140
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
How many V1s shall I take?

141
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
Zero of them.

142
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
Yeah, no, take no V1s.

143
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
But how many V2s?

144
00:09:28 --> 00:09:29
Six.

145
00:09:29 --> 00:09:29
OK.

146
00:09:29 --> 00:09:30
Or five.

147
00:09:30 --> 00:09:36
Then -- in other words,
the point is if the zero

148
00:09:36 --> 00:09:42
vector's in there,
if the zero --

149
00:09:42 --> 00:09:46
if one of these vectors is the
zero vector, independence is

150
00:09:46 --> 00:09:47
dead, right?

151
00:09:47 --> 00:09:51
If one of those vectors is the
zero vector then I could always

152
00:09:51 --> 00:09:54
take -- include that one and
none of the others,

153
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57
and I would get the zero
answer, and I would show

154
00:09:57 --> 00:09:58
dependence.

155
00:09:58 --> 00:09:58.32
OK.

156
00:09:58.32 --> 00:10:01
Now, let me,
let me finally draw an example

157
00:10:01 --> 00:10:04
where they will be independent.

158
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
Suppose that's V1 and that's
V2.

159
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
Those are surely independent,
right?

160
00:10:10 --> 00:10:15
Any combination of V1 and V2,
will not be zero except,

161
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17.85
the zero combination.

162
00:10:17.85 --> 00:10:20
So those would be independent.

163
00:10:20 --> 00:10:25
But now let me,
let me stick in a third vector,

164
00:10:25 --> 00:10:25
V3.

165
00:10:25 --> 00:10:31
Independent or dependent now,
those three vectors?

166
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
So now n is three here.

167
00:10:33 --> 00:10:39
I'm in two dimensional space,
whatever, I'm in the plane.

168
00:10:39 --> 00:10:43
I have three vectors that I
didn't draw so carefully.

169
00:10:43 --> 00:10:47
I didn't even tell you what
exactly they were.

170
00:10:47 --> 00:10:53
But what's this answer on
dependent or independent?

171
00:10:53 --> 00:10:54
Dependent.

172
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
How do I know those are
dependent?

173
00:10:57 --> 00:11:02
How do I know that some
combination of V1,

174
00:11:02 --> 00:11:05
V2, and V3 gives me the zero
vector?

175
00:11:05 --> 00:11:08
I know because of that.

176
00:11:08 --> 00:11:14
That's the key fact that tells
me that three vectors in the

177
00:11:14 --> 00:11:18
plane have to be dependent.

178
00:11:18 --> 00:11:19
Why's that?

179
00:11:19 --> 00:11:24
What's the connection between
the dependence of these three

180
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
vectors and that fact?

181
00:11:26 --> 00:11:26
OK.

182
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
So here's the connection.

183
00:11:29 --> 00:11:33
I take the matrix A that has V1
in its first column,

184
00:11:33 --> 00:11:39
V2 in its second column,
V3 in its third column.

185
00:11:39 --> 00:11:42
So it's got three columns.

186
00:11:42 --> 00:11:48
And V1 -- I don't know,
that looks like about two one

187
00:11:48 --> 00:11:48
to me.

188
00:11:48 --> 00:11:52
V2 looks like it might be one
two.

189
00:11:52 --> 00:11:59
V3 looks like it might be maybe
two, maybe two and a half,

190
00:11:59 --> 00:12:00
minus one.

191
00:12:00 --> 00:12:00
OK.

192
00:12:00 --> 00:12:07
Those are my three vectors,
and I put them in the columns

193
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
of A.

194
00:12:09 --> 00:12:13
Now that matrix A is two by
three.

195
00:12:13 --> 00:12:20.26
It fits this pattern,
that where we know we've got

196
00:12:20.26 --> 00:12:25
extra variables,
we know we have some free

197
00:12:25 --> 00:12:33
variables, we know that there's
some combination --

198
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
and let me instead of x-s,
let me call them c1,

199
00:12:36 --> 00:12:39
c2, and c3 -- that gives the
zero vector.

200
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
Sorry that my little bit of art
got in the way.

201
00:12:42 --> 00:12:43
Do you see the point?

202
00:12:43 --> 00:12:47
When I have a matrix,
I'm interested in whether its

203
00:12:47 --> 00:12:49
columns are dependent or
independent.

204
00:12:49 --> 00:12:53
The columns are dependent if
there is something in the null

205
00:12:53 --> 00:12:55.23
space.

206
00:12:55.23 --> 00:12:59.31
The columns are dependent
because this,

207
00:12:59.31 --> 00:13:05
this thing in the null space
says that c1 of that plus c2 of

208
00:13:05 --> 00:13:08.76
that plus c3 of this is zero.

209
00:13:08.76 --> 00:13:12
So in other words,
I can go out some V1,

210
00:13:12 --> 00:13:17.78
out some more V2,
back on V3, and end up zero.

211
00:13:17.78 --> 00:13:19
OK.

212
00:13:19 --> 00:13:27
So let -- here I've give the
general, abstract definition,

213
00:13:27 --> 00:13:35
but let me repeat that
definition -- this is like

214
00:13:35 --> 00:13:40
repeat -- let me call them Vs
now.

215
00:13:40 --> 00:13:47
V1 up to Vn are the columns of
a matrix A.

216
00:13:47 --> 00:13:53
In other words,
this is telling me that if I'm

217
00:13:53 --> 00:14:00
in m dimensional space,
like two dimensional space in

218
00:14:00 --> 00:14:07
the example, I can answer the
dependence-independence question

219
00:14:07 --> 00:14:14.7
directly by putting those
vectors in the columns of a

220
00:14:14.7 --> 00:14:16
matrix.

221
00:14:16 --> 00:14:22
They are independent if the
null space of A,

222
00:14:22 --> 00:14:24
of A, is what?

223
00:14:24 --> 00:14:32
If I have a bunch of columns in
a matrix, I'm looking at their

224
00:14:32 --> 00:14:38
combinations,
but that's just A times the

225
00:14:38 --> 00:14:39
vector of c-s.

226
00:14:39 --> 00:14:47
And these columns will be
independent if the null space of

227
00:14:47 --> 00:14:51
A is the zero vector.

228
00:14:51 --> 00:15:02
They are dependent if there's
something else in there.

229
00:15:02 --> 00:15:11
If there's something else in
the null space,

230
00:15:11 --> 00:15:23
if A times c gives the zero
vector for some non-zero vector

231
00:15:23 --> 00:15:29
c in the null space.

232
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
Then they're dependent,
because that's telling me a

233
00:15:32 --> 00:15:36
combination of the columns gives
the zero column.

234
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38.96
I think you're with be,
because we've seen,

235
00:15:38.96 --> 00:15:42
like, lecture after lecture,
we're looking at the

236
00:15:42 --> 00:15:46
combinations of the columns and
asking, do we get zero or don't

237
00:15:46 --> 00:15:47.62
we?

238
00:15:47.62 --> 00:15:50
And now we're giving the
official name,

239
00:15:50 --> 00:15:54
dependent if we do,
independent if we don't.

240
00:15:54 --> 00:15:57
So I could express this in
other words now.

241
00:15:57 --> 00:16:02
I could say the rank -- what's
the rank in this independent

242
00:16:02 --> 00:16:03
case?

243
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
The rank r of the,
of the matrix,

244
00:16:05 --> 00:16:10
in the case of independent
columns, is?

245
00:16:10 --> 00:16:12
So the columns are independent.

246
00:16:12 --> 00:16:16
So how many pivot columns have
I got.

247
00:16:16 --> 00:16:16
All n.

248
00:16:16 --> 00:16:21
All the columns would be pivot
columns, because free columns

249
00:16:21 --> 00:16:27
are telling me that they're a
combination of earlier columns.

250
00:16:27 --> 00:16:32.24
So this would be the case where
the rank is n.

251
00:16:32.24 --> 00:16:38
This would be the case where
the rank is smaller than n.

252
00:16:38 --> 00:16:45
So in this case the rank is n
and the null space of A is only

253
00:16:45 --> 00:16:47
the zero vector.

254
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
And no free variables.

255
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
No free variables.

256
00:16:52 --> 00:16:57
And this is the case yes free
variables.

257
00:16:57 --> 00:17:05
If you'll allow me to stretch
the English language that far.

258
00:17:05 --> 00:17:11
That's the case where we have,
a combination that gives the

259
00:17:11 --> 00:17:12
zero column.

260
00:17:12 --> 00:17:19
I'm often interested in the
case when my vectors are popped

261
00:17:19 --> 00:17:20
into a matrix.

262
00:17:20 --> 00:17:26
So the, the definition over
there of independence didn't

263
00:17:26 --> 00:17:30
talk about any matrix.

264
00:17:30 --> 00:17:35
The vectors didn't have to be
vectors in N dimensional space.

265
00:17:35 --> 00:17:40
And I want to give you some
examples of vectors that aren't

266
00:17:40 --> 00:17:44
what you think of immediately as
vectors.

267
00:17:44 --> 00:17:48
But most of the time,
this is -- the vectors we think

268
00:17:48 --> 00:17:50
of are columns.

269
00:17:50 --> 00:17:53
And we can put them in a
matrix.

270
00:17:53 --> 00:17:59
And then independence or
dependence comes back to the

271
00:17:59 --> 00:18:00
null space.

272
00:18:00 --> 00:18:00
OK.

273
00:18:00 --> 00:18:04
So that's the idea of
independence.

274
00:18:04 --> 00:18:09.15
Can I just, yeah,
let me go on to spanning a

275
00:18:09.15 --> 00:18:09
space.

276
00:18:09 --> 00:18:15
What does it mean for a bunch
of vectors to span a space?

277
00:18:15 --> 00:18:21
Well, actually,
we've seen it already.

278
00:18:21 --> 00:18:25
You remember,
if we had a columns in a

279
00:18:25 --> 00:18:32
matrix, we took all their
combinations and that gave us

280
00:18:32 --> 00:18:34
the column space.

281
00:18:34 --> 00:18:41
Those vectors that we started
with span that column space.

282
00:18:41 --> 00:18:49
So spanning a space means -- so
let me move that important stuff

283
00:18:49 --> 00:18:51
right up.

284
00:18:51 --> 00:18:52
OK.

285
00:18:52 --> 00:19:02
So vectors -- let me call them,
say, V1 up to -- call you some

286
00:19:02 --> 00:19:10
different letter,
say Vl -- span a space,

287
00:19:10 --> 00:19:18
a subspace, or just a vector
space I could say,

288
00:19:18 --> 00:19:26
span a space means,
means the space consists of all

289
00:19:26 --> 00:19:34
combinations of those vectors.

290
00:19:34 --> 00:19:39
That's exactly what we did with
the column space.

291
00:19:39 --> 00:19:46
So now I could say in shorthand
the columns of a matrix span the

292
00:19:46 --> 00:19:48
column space.

293
00:19:48 --> 00:19:55
So you remember it's a bunch of
vectors that have this property

294
00:19:55 --> 00:20:01
that they span a space,
and actually if I give you a

295
00:20:01 --> 00:20:07.72
bunch of vectors and say --
OK, let S be the space that

296
00:20:07.72 --> 00:20:13
they span, in other words let S
contain all their combinations,

297
00:20:13 --> 00:20:17
that space S will be the
smallest space with those

298
00:20:17 --> 00:20:18
vectors in it,
right?

299
00:20:18 --> 00:20:24
Because any space with those
vectors in it must have all the

300
00:20:24 --> 00:20:27
combinations of those vectors in
it.

301
00:20:27 --> 00:20:32
And if I stop there,
then I've got the smallest

302
00:20:32 --> 00:20:37
space, and that's the space that
they span.

303
00:20:37 --> 00:20:37
OK.

304
00:20:37 --> 00:20:41
So I'm just -- rather than,
needing to say,

305
00:20:41 --> 00:20:47.25
take all linear combinations
and put them in a space,

306
00:20:47.25 --> 00:20:51
I'm compressing that into the
word span.

307
00:20:51 --> 00:20:54.24
Straightforward.

308
00:20:54.24 --> 00:20:54
OK.

309
00:20:54 --> 00:20:58.78
So if I think of a,
of the column space of a

310
00:20:58.78 --> 00:20:59
matrix.

311
00:20:59 --> 00:21:03
I've got their -- so I start
with the columns.

312
00:21:03 --> 00:21:06
I take all their combinations.

313
00:21:06 --> 00:21:09
That gives me the columns
space.

314
00:21:09 --> 00:21:12
They span the column space.

315
00:21:12 --> 00:21:15
Now are they independent?

316
00:21:15 --> 00:21:18
Maybe yes, maybe no.

317
00:21:18 --> 00:21:23
It depends on the particular
columns that went into that

318
00:21:23 --> 00:21:23
matrix.

319
00:21:23 --> 00:21:28
But obviously I'm highly
interested in a set of vectors

320
00:21:28 --> 00:21:31
that spans a space and is
independent.

321
00:21:31 --> 00:21:37.29
That's, that means like I've
got the right number of vectors.

322
00:21:37.29 --> 00:21:42
If I didn't have all of them,
I wouldn't have my whole space.

323
00:21:42 --> 00:21:48
If I had more than that,
they probably wouldn't --

324
00:21:48 --> 00:21:52
they wouldn't be independent.

325
00:21:52 --> 00:22:00
So, like, basis -- and that's
the word that's coming -- is

326
00:22:00 --> 00:22:02
just right.

327
00:22:02 --> 00:22:08
So here let me put what that
word means.

328
00:22:08 --> 00:22:16
A basis for a vector space is,
is a, is a sequence of vectors

329
00:22:16 --> 00:22:20
--
shall I call them V1,

330
00:22:20 --> 00:22:26
V2, up to let me say Vd now,
I'll stop with that letters --

331
00:22:26 --> 00:22:28
that has two properties.

332
00:22:28 --> 00:22:32
I've got enough vectors and not
too many.

333
00:22:32 --> 00:22:36
It's a natural idea of a basis.

334
00:22:36 --> 00:22:41
So a basis is a bunch of
vectors in the space and it's a

335
00:22:41 --> 00:22:46
so it's a sequence of vectors
with two properties,

336
00:22:46 --> 00:22:49
with two properties.

337
00:22:49 --> 00:22:55
One, they are independent.

338
00:22:55 --> 00:23:02
And two -- you know what's
coming?

339
00:23:02 --> 00:23:07
-- they span the space.

340
00:23:07 --> 00:23:07
OK.

341
00:23:07 --> 00:23:17
Let me take -- so time for
examples, of course.

342
00:23:17 --> 00:23:26
So I'm asking you now to put
definition one,

343
00:23:26 --> 00:23:37
the definition of independence,
together with definition two,

344
00:23:37 --> 00:23:41
and let's look at examples,
because this is -- this

345
00:23:41 --> 00:23:45
combination means the set I've
-- of vectors I have is just

346
00:23:45 --> 00:23:50
right, and the -- so that this
idea of a basis will be central.

347
00:23:50 --> 00:23:54
I'll always be asking you now
for a basis.

348
00:23:54 --> 00:23:58
Whenever I look at a subspace,
if I ask you for -- if you give

349
00:23:58 --> 00:24:02
me a basis for that subspace,
you've told me what it is.

350
00:24:02 --> 00:24:05
You've told me everything I
need to know about that

351
00:24:05 --> 00:24:06
subspace.

352
00:24:06 --> 00:24:09
Those -- I take their
combinations and I know that I

353
00:24:09 --> 00:24:11
need all the combinations.

354
00:24:11 --> 00:24:12
OK.

355
00:24:12 --> 00:24:13
Examples.

356
00:24:13 --> 00:24:17
OK, so examples of a basis.

357
00:24:17 --> 00:24:23.02
Let me start with two
dimensional space.

358
00:24:23.02 --> 00:24:27
Suppose the space -- say
example.

359
00:24:27 --> 00:24:32.44
The space is,
oh, let's make it R^3.

360
00:24:32.44 --> 00:24:36
Real three dimensional space.

361
00:24:36 --> 00:24:39
Give me one basis.

362
00:24:39 --> 00:24:42
One basis is?

363
00:24:42 --> 00:24:47
So I want some vectors,
because if I ask you for a

364
00:24:47 --> 00:24:52
basis, I'm asking you for
vectors, a little list of

365
00:24:52 --> 00:24:53
vectors.

366
00:24:53 --> 00:24:56
And it should be just right.

367
00:24:56 --> 00:25:01
So what would be a basis for
three dimensional space?

368
00:25:01 --> 00:25:05
Well, the first basis that
comes to mind,

369
00:25:05 --> 00:25:10
why don't we write that down.

370
00:25:10 --> 00:25:15
The first basis that comes to
mind is this vector,

371
00:25:15 --> 00:25:18
this vector,
and this vector.

372
00:25:18 --> 00:25:18
OK.

373
00:25:18 --> 00:25:20
That's one basis.

374
00:25:20 --> 00:25:25
Not the only basis,
that's going to be my point.

375
00:25:25 --> 00:25:29
But let's just see -- yes,
that's a basis.

376
00:25:29 --> 00:25:34
Are, are those vectors
independent?

377
00:25:34 --> 00:25:38
So that's the like the x,
y, z axes, so if those are not

378
00:25:38 --> 00:25:40
independent, we're in trouble.

379
00:25:40 --> 00:25:42
Certainly, they are.

380
00:25:42 --> 00:25:46
Take a combination c1 of this
vector plus c2 of this vector

381
00:25:46 --> 00:25:50
plus c3 of that vector and try
to make it give the zero vector.

382
00:25:50 --> 00:25:52
What are the c-s?

383
00:25:52 --> 00:25:56
If c1 of that plus c2 of that
plus c3 of that gives me 0 0 0,

384
00:25:56 --> 00:25:59
then the c-s are all -- 0,
right.

385
00:25:59 --> 00:26:03
So that's the test for
independence.

386
00:26:03 --> 00:26:09
In the language of matrices,
which was under that board,

387
00:26:09 --> 00:26:13
I could make those the columns
of a matrix.

388
00:26:13 --> 00:26:17
Well, it would be the identity
matrix.

389
00:26:17 --> 00:26:21
Then I would ask,
what's the null space of the

390
00:26:21 --> 00:26:24
identity matrix?

391
00:26:24 --> 00:26:27
And you would say it's only the
zero vector.

392
00:26:27 --> 00:26:31
And I would say,
fine, then the columns are

393
00:26:31 --> 00:26:32.19
independent.

394
00:26:32.19 --> 00:26:36
The only thing -- the identity
times a vector giving zero,

395
00:26:36 --> 00:26:40
the only vector that does that
is zero.

396
00:26:40 --> 00:26:40
OK.

397
00:26:40 --> 00:26:45
Now that's not the only basis.

398
00:26:45 --> 00:26:47
Far from it.

399
00:26:47 --> 00:26:53
Tell me another basis,
a second basis,

400
00:26:53 --> 00:26:55
another basis.

401
00:26:55 --> 00:27:02
So, give me -- well,
I'll just start it out.

402
00:27:02 --> 00:27:04
One one two.

403
00:27:04 --> 00:27:06
Two two five.

404
00:27:06 --> 00:27:12.69
Suppose I stopped there.

405
00:27:12.69 --> 00:27:18
Has that little bunch of
vectors got the properties that

406
00:27:18 --> 00:27:21
I'm asking for in a basis for
R^3?

407
00:27:21 --> 00:27:25
We're looking for a basis for
R^3.

408
00:27:25 --> 00:27:29
Are they independent,
those two column vectors?

409
00:27:29 --> 00:27:30
Yes.

410
00:27:30 --> 00:27:33
Do they span R^3?

411
00:27:33 --> 00:27:33.35
No.

412
00:27:33.35 --> 00:27:34
Our feeling is no.

413
00:27:34 --> 00:27:36
Our feeling is no.

414
00:27:36 --> 00:27:41
Our feeling is that there're
some vectors in R3 that are not

415
00:27:41 --> 00:27:43
combinations of those.

416
00:27:43 --> 00:27:43.29
OK.

417
00:27:43.29 --> 00:27:47
So suppose I add in -- I need
another vector then,

418
00:27:47 --> 00:27:51
because these two don't span
the space.

419
00:27:51 --> 00:27:51
OK.

420
00:27:51 --> 00:27:56
Now it would be foolish for me
to put in three three seven,

421
00:27:56 --> 00:27:58
right, as the third vector.

422
00:27:58 --> 00:28:00
That would be a goof.

423
00:28:00 --> 00:28:04
Because that,
if I put in three three seven,

424
00:28:04 --> 00:28:08.65
those vectors would be
dependent, right?

425
00:28:08.65 --> 00:28:12
If I put in three three seven,
it would be the sum of those

426
00:28:12 --> 00:28:16
two, it would lie in the same
plane as those.

427
00:28:16 --> 00:28:18
It wouldn't be independent.

428
00:28:18 --> 00:28:21.31
My attempt to create a basis
would be dead.

429
00:28:21.31 --> 00:28:25
But if I take -- so what vector
can I take?

430
00:28:25 --> 00:28:29
I can take any vector that's
not in that plane.

431
00:28:29 --> 00:28:33
Let me try -- I hope that 3 3 8
would do it.

432
00:28:33 --> 00:28:37
At least it's not the sum of
those two vectors.

433
00:28:37 --> 00:28:40
But I believe that's a basis.

434
00:28:40 --> 00:28:45
And what's the test then,
for that to be a basis?

435
00:28:45 --> 00:28:51.57
Because I just picked those
numbers, and if I had picked,

436
00:28:51.57 --> 00:28:57
5 7 -14 how would we know do we
have a basis or don't we?

437
00:28:57 --> 00:29:02
You would put them in the
columns of a matrix,

438
00:29:02 --> 00:29:08
and you would do elimination,
row reduction --

439
00:29:08 --> 00:29:15
and you would see do you get
any free variables or are all

440
00:29:15 --> 00:29:18
the columns pivot columns.

441
00:29:18 --> 00:29:25
Well now actually we have a
square -- the matrix would be

442
00:29:25 --> 00:29:27
three by three.

443
00:29:27 --> 00:29:33
So, what's the test on the
matrix then?

444
00:29:33 --> 00:29:42
The matrix -- so in this case,
when my space is R^3 and I have

445
00:29:42 --> 00:29:48
three vectors,
my matrix is square and what I

446
00:29:48 --> 00:29:57
asking about that matrix in
order for those columns to be a

447
00:29:57 --> 00:29:58.34
basis?

448
00:29:58.34 --> 00:30:05
So in this -- for R^n,
if I have -- n vectors give a

449
00:30:05 --> 00:30:12
basis if the n by n matrix with
those columns,

450
00:30:12 --> 00:30:18
with those columns,
is what?

451
00:30:18 --> 00:30:21
What's the requirement on that
matrix?

452
00:30:21 --> 00:30:24
Invertible, right,
right.

453
00:30:24 --> 00:30:27
The matrix should be
invertible.

454
00:30:27 --> 00:30:32
For a square matrix,
that's the, that's the perfect

455
00:30:32 --> 00:30:33
answer.

456
00:30:33 --> 00:30:34
Is invertible.

457
00:30:34 --> 00:30:39
So that's when,
that's when the space is the

458
00:30:39 --> 00:30:42
whole space R^n.

459
00:30:42 --> 00:30:46
Let me, let me be sure you're
with me here.

460
00:30:46 --> 00:30:48
Let me remove that.

461
00:30:48 --> 00:30:54
Are those two vectors a basis
for any space at all?

462
00:30:54 --> 00:31:00
Is there a vector space that
those really are a basis for,

463
00:31:00 --> 00:31:06
those, that pair of vectors,
this guy and this 1,

464
00:31:06 --> 00:31:08
1 1 2 and 2 2 5?

465
00:31:08 --> 00:31:12
Is there a space for which
that's a basis?

466
00:31:12 --> 00:31:12
Sure.

467
00:31:12 --> 00:31:16
They're independent,
so they satisfy the first

468
00:31:16 --> 00:31:22
requirement, so what space shall
I take for them to be a basis

469
00:31:22 --> 00:31:22
of?

470
00:31:22 --> 00:31:26
What spaces will they be a
basis for?

471
00:31:26 --> 00:31:28
The one they span.

472
00:31:28 --> 00:31:30
Their combinations.

473
00:31:30 --> 00:31:31
It's a plane,
right?

474
00:31:31 --> 00:31:34
It'll be a plane inside R^3.

475
00:31:34 --> 00:31:39
So if I take this vector 1 1 2,
say it goes there,

476
00:31:39 --> 00:31:43
and this vector 2 2 5,
say it goes there,

477
00:31:43 --> 00:31:49
those are a basis for --
because they span a plane.

478
00:31:49 --> 00:31:52
And they're a basis for the
plane, because they're

479
00:31:52 --> 00:31:52
independent.

480
00:31:52 --> 00:31:56
If I stick in some third guy,
like 3 3 7, which is in the

481
00:31:56 --> 00:31:58
plane -- suppose I put in,
try to put in 3 3 7,

482
00:31:58 --> 00:32:01.45
then the three vectors would
still span the plane,

483
00:32:01.45 --> 00:32:04
but they wouldn't be a basis
anymore because they're not

484
00:32:04 --> 00:32:06.32
independent anymore.

485
00:32:06.32 --> 00:32:06
OK.

486
00:32:06 --> 00:32:15
So, we're looking at the
question of -- again,

487
00:32:15 --> 00:32:24.81
the case with independent
columns is the case where the

488
00:32:24.81 --> 00:32:32
column vectors span the column
space.

489
00:32:32 --> 00:32:36.93
They're independent,
so they're a basis for the

490
00:32:36.93 --> 00:32:38
column space.

491
00:32:38 --> 00:32:38
OK.

492
00:32:38 --> 00:32:41
So now there's one bit of
intuition.

493
00:32:41 --> 00:32:44
Let me go back to all of R^n.

494
00:32:44 --> 00:32:46
So I -- where I put 3 3 8.

495
00:32:46 --> 00:32:47.18
OK.

496
00:32:47.18 --> 00:32:51
The first message is that the
basis is not unique,

497
00:32:51 --> 00:32:53.48
right.

498
00:32:53.48 --> 00:32:56
There's zillions of bases.

499
00:32:56 --> 00:33:00
I take any invertible three by
three matrix,

500
00:33:00 --> 00:33:03
its columns are a basis for
R^3.

501
00:33:03 --> 00:33:07
The column space is R^3,
and if those,

502
00:33:07 --> 00:33:13
if that matrix is invertible,
those columns are independent,

503
00:33:13 --> 00:33:16
I've got a basis for R^3.

504
00:33:16 --> 00:33:19
So there're many,
many bases.

505
00:33:19 --> 00:33:24
But there is something in
common for all those bases.

506
00:33:24 --> 00:33:31
There's something that this
basis shares with that basis and

507
00:33:31 --> 00:33:33.87
every other basis for R^3.

508
00:33:33.87 --> 00:33:35
And what's that?

509
00:33:35 --> 00:33:41
Well, you saw it coming,
because when I stopped here and

510
00:33:41 --> 00:33:47
asked if that was a basis for
R^3, you said no.

511
00:33:47 --> 00:33:53
And I know that you said no
because you knew there weren't

512
00:33:53 --> 00:33:55
enough vectors there.

513
00:33:55 --> 00:33:59
And the great fact is that
there're many,

514
00:33:59 --> 00:34:04
many bases, but -- let me put
in somebody else,

515
00:34:04 --> 00:34:06
just for variety.

516
00:34:06 --> 00:34:11
There are many,
many bases, but they all have

517
00:34:11 --> 00:34:15
the same number of vectors.

518
00:34:15 --> 00:34:20
If we're talking about the
space R^3, then that number of

519
00:34:20 --> 00:34:22
vectors is three.

520
00:34:22 --> 00:34:28
If we're talking about the
space R^n, then that number of

521
00:34:28 --> 00:34:29
vectors is n.

522
00:34:29 --> 00:34:35
If we're talking about some
other space, the column space of

523
00:34:35 --> 00:34:40
some matrix, or the null space
of some matrix,

524
00:34:40 --> 00:34:47
or some other space that we
haven't even thought of,

525
00:34:47 --> 00:34:52
then that still is true that
every basis -- that there're

526
00:34:52 --> 00:34:58.51
lots of bases but every basis
has the same number of vectors.

527
00:34:58.51 --> 00:35:01.77
Let me write that great fact
down.

528
00:35:01.77 --> 00:35:05
Every basis -- we're given a
space.

529
00:35:05 --> 00:35:06
Given a space.

530
00:35:06 --> 00:35:12
R^3 or R^n or some other column
space of a matrix or the null

531
00:35:12 --> 00:35:18.07
space of a matrix or some other
vector space.

532
00:35:18.07 --> 00:35:26
Then the great fact is that
every basis for this,

533
00:35:26 --> 00:35:33
for the space has the same
number of vectors.

534
00:35:33 --> 00:35:43
If one basis has six vectors,
then every other basis has six

535
00:35:43 --> 00:35:44
vectors.

536
00:35:44 --> 00:35:54
So that number six is telling
me like it's telling me how big

537
00:35:54 --> 00:35:58
is the space.

538
00:35:58 --> 00:36:02
It's telling me how many
vectors do I have to have to

539
00:36:02 --> 00:36:03
have a basis.

540
00:36:03 --> 00:36:05
And of course we're seeing it
this way.

541
00:36:05 --> 00:36:08
That number six,
if we had seven vectors,

542
00:36:08 --> 00:36:10
then we've got too many.

543
00:36:10 --> 00:36:13
If we have five vectors we
haven't got enough.

544
00:36:13 --> 00:36:18
Sixes are like just right for
whatever space that is.

545
00:36:18 --> 00:36:21.47
And what do we call that
number?

546
00:36:21.47 --> 00:36:27
That number is -- now I'm ready
for the last definition today.

547
00:36:27 --> 00:36:30
It's the dimension of that
space.

548
00:36:30 --> 00:36:36
So every basis for a space has
the same number of vectors in

549
00:36:36 --> 00:36:36
it.

550
00:36:36 --> 00:36:42
Not the same vectors,
all sorts of bases --

551
00:36:42 --> 00:36:47.68
but the same number of vectors
is always the same,

552
00:36:47.68 --> 00:36:51
and that number is the
dimension.

553
00:36:51 --> 00:36:53
This is definitional.

554
00:36:53 --> 00:36:58
This number is the dimension of
the space.

555
00:36:58 --> 00:36:58
OK.

556
00:36:58 --> 00:36:59
OK.

557
00:36:59 --> 00:37:01
Let's do some examples.

558
00:37:01 --> 00:37:05.71
Because now we've got
definitions.

559
00:37:05.71 --> 00:37:12
Let me repeat the four things,
the four words that have now

560
00:37:12 --> 00:37:15
got defined.

561
00:37:15 --> 00:37:19
Independence,
that looks at combinations not

562
00:37:19 --> 00:37:19
being zero.

563
00:37:19 --> 00:37:23
Spanning, that looks at all the
combinations.

564
00:37:23 --> 00:37:27
Basis, that's the one that
combines independence and

565
00:37:27 --> 00:37:28
spanning.

566
00:37:28 --> 00:37:33
And now we've got the idea of
the dimension of a space.

567
00:37:33 --> 00:37:40
It's the number of vectors in
any basis, because all bases

568
00:37:40 --> 00:37:42.79
have the same number.

569
00:37:42.79 --> 00:37:43
OK.

570
00:37:43 --> 00:37:45.47
Let's take examples.

571
00:37:45.47 --> 00:37:50
Suppose I take,
my space is -- examples now --

572
00:37:50 --> 00:37:55
space is the,
say, the column space of this

573
00:37:55 --> 00:37:57
matrix.

574
00:37:57 --> 00:38:01
Let me write down a matrix.
1 1 1, 2 1 2,

575
00:38:01 --> 00:38:07
and I'll -- just to make it
clear, I'll take the sum there,

576
00:38:07 --> 00:38:12
3 2 3, and let me take the sum
of all -- oh,

577
00:38:12 --> 00:38:17
let me put in one -- yeah,
I'll put in one one one again.

578
00:38:17 --> 00:38:19
OK.

579
00:38:19 --> 00:38:21
So that's four vectors.

580
00:38:21 --> 00:38:25.74
OK, do they span the column
space of that matrix?

581
00:38:25.74 --> 00:38:29
Let me repeat,
do they span the column space

582
00:38:29 --> 00:38:31.15
of that matrix?

583
00:38:31.15 --> 00:38:31
Yes.

584
00:38:31 --> 00:38:35.72
By definition,
that's what the column space --

585
00:38:35.72 --> 00:38:38
where it comes from.

586
00:38:38 --> 00:38:41
Are they a basis for the column
space?

587
00:38:41 --> 00:38:42
Are they independent?

588
00:38:42 --> 00:38:44
No, they're not independent.

589
00:38:44 --> 00:38:47
There's something in that null
space.

590
00:38:47 --> 00:38:51
Maybe we can -- so let's look
at the null space of the matrix.

591
00:38:51 --> 00:38:56
Tell me a vector that's in the
null space of that matrix.

592
00:38:56 --> 00:39:03
So I'm looking for some vector
that combines those columns and

593
00:39:03 --> 00:39:05
produces the zero column.

594
00:39:05 --> 00:39:11
Or in other words,
I'm looking for solutions to A

595
00:39:11 --> 00:39:12
X equals zero.

596
00:39:12 --> 00:39:17
So tell me a vector in the null
space.

597
00:39:17 --> 00:39:20
Maybe -- well,
this was, this column was that

598
00:39:20 --> 00:39:24
one plus that one,
so maybe if I have one of those

599
00:39:24 --> 00:39:28
and minus one of those that
would be a vector in the null

600
00:39:28 --> 00:39:28
space.

601
00:39:28 --> 00:39:32
So, you've already told me now,
are those vectors independent,

602
00:39:32 --> 00:39:37
the answer is -- those column
vectors, the answer is -- no.

603
00:39:37 --> 00:39:38
Right?

604
00:39:38 --> 00:39:40
They're not independent.

605
00:39:40 --> 00:39:43.33
Because -- you knew they
weren't independent.

606
00:39:43.33 --> 00:39:47
Anyway, minus one of this minus
one of this plus one of this

607
00:39:47 --> 00:39:50.03
zero of that is the zero vector.

608
00:39:50.03 --> 00:39:50
OK.

609
00:39:50 --> 00:39:52
OK, so they're not independent.

610
00:39:52 --> 00:39:56
They span, but they're not
independent.

611
00:39:56 --> 00:39:59
Tell me a basis for that column
space.

612
00:39:59 --> 00:40:02.73
What's a basis for the column
space?

613
00:40:02.73 --> 00:40:07
These are all the questions
that the homework asks,

614
00:40:07 --> 00:40:10
the quizzes ask,
the final exam will ask.

615
00:40:10 --> 00:40:16
Find a basis for the column
space of this matrix.

616
00:40:16 --> 00:40:16
OK.

617
00:40:16 --> 00:40:21
Now there's many answers,
but give me the most natural

618
00:40:21 --> 00:40:21.67
answer.

619
00:40:21.67 --> 00:40:23
Columns one and two.

620
00:40:23 --> 00:40:25
Columns one and two.

621
00:40:25 --> 00:40:27
That's the natural answer.

622
00:40:27 --> 00:40:31
Those are the pivot columns,
because, I mean,

623
00:40:31 --> 00:40:33
we s- we begin systematically.

624
00:40:33 --> 00:40:37
We look at the first column,
it's OK.

625
00:40:37 --> 00:40:40
We can put that in the basis.

626
00:40:40 --> 00:40:43
We look at the second column,
it's OK.

627
00:40:43 --> 00:40:46
We can put that in the basis.

628
00:40:46 --> 00:40:49
The third column we can't put
in the basis.

629
00:40:49 --> 00:40:52
The fourth column we can't,
again.

630
00:40:52 --> 00:40:58
So the rank of the matrix is --
what's the rank of our matrix?

631
00:40:58 --> 00:40:59
Two.

632
00:40:59 --> 00:41:00.03
Two.

633
00:41:00.03 --> 00:41:08
And, and now that rank is also
-- we also have another word.

634
00:41:08 --> 00:41:12
We, we have a great theorem
here.

635
00:41:12 --> 00:41:15
The rank of A,
that rank r,

636
00:41:15 --> 00:41:22
is the number of pivot columns
and it's also -- well,

637
00:41:22 --> 00:41:27
so now please use my new word.

638
00:41:27 --> 00:41:34
This, it's the number two,
of course, two is the rank of

639
00:41:34 --> 00:41:41.13
my matrix,
it's the number of pivot

640
00:41:41.13 --> 00:41:46.9
columns, those pivot columns
form a basis,

641
00:41:46.9 --> 00:41:50
of course, so what's two?

642
00:41:50 --> 00:41:53
It's the dimension.

643
00:41:53 --> 00:41:59
The rank of A,
the number of pivot columns,

644
00:41:59 --> 00:42:04.07
is the dimension of the column
space.

645
00:42:04.07 --> 00:42:06
Of course, you say.

646
00:42:06 --> 00:42:08
It had to be.

647
00:42:08 --> 00:42:11
Right.

648
00:42:11 --> 00:42:15
But just watch,
look for one moment at the,

649
00:42:15 --> 00:42:19
the language,
the way the English words get

650
00:42:19 --> 00:42:20
involved here.

651
00:42:20 --> 00:42:25
I take the rank of a matrix,
the rank of a matrix.

652
00:42:25 --> 00:42:31
It's a number of columns and
it's the dimension of -- not the

653
00:42:31 --> 00:42:37
dimension of the matrix,
that's what I want to say.

654
00:42:37 --> 00:42:41
It's the dimension of a space,
a subspace, the column space.

655
00:42:41 --> 00:42:45
Do you see, I don't take the
dimension of A.

656
00:42:45 --> 00:42:47
That's not what I want.

657
00:42:47 --> 00:42:51.56
I'm looking for the dimension
of the column space of A.

658
00:42:51.56 --> 00:42:56
If you use those words right,
it shows you've got the idea

659
00:42:56 --> 00:42:56
right.

660
00:42:56 --> 00:42:58
Similarly here.

661
00:42:58 --> 00:43:01
I don't talk about the rank of
a subspace.

662
00:43:01 --> 00:43:03
It's a matrix that has a rank.

663
00:43:03 --> 00:43:05
I talk about the rank of a
matrix.

664
00:43:05 --> 00:43:09
And the beauty is that these
definitions just merge so that

665
00:43:09 --> 00:43:13.76
the rank of a matrix is the
dimension of its column space.

666
00:43:13.76 --> 00:43:15
And in this example it's two.

667
00:43:15 --> 00:43:19
And then the further question
is, what's a basis?

668
00:43:19 --> 00:43:22
And the first two columns are a
basis.

669
00:43:22 --> 00:43:24.14
Tell me another basis.

670
00:43:24.14 --> 00:43:26
Another basis for the columns
space.

671
00:43:26 --> 00:43:29
You see I just keep hammering
away.

672
00:43:29 --> 00:43:32
I apologize,
but it's, I have to be sure you

673
00:43:32 --> 00:43:33
have the idea of basis.

674
00:43:33 --> 00:43:37
Tell me another basis for the
column space.

675
00:43:37 --> 00:43:42
Well, you could take columns
one and three.

676
00:43:42 --> 00:43:46
That would be a basis for the
column space.

677
00:43:46 --> 00:43:50
Or columns two and three would
be a basis.

678
00:43:50 --> 00:43:53
Or columns two and four.

679
00:43:53 --> 00:44:00
Or tell me another basis that's
not made out of those columns at

680
00:44:00 --> 00:44:01
all?

681
00:44:01 --> 00:44:05
So -- I guess I'm giving you
infinitely many possibilities,

682
00:44:05 --> 00:44:07
so I can't expect a unanimous
answer here.

683
00:44:07 --> 00:44:10
I'll tell you -- but let's look
at another basis,

684
00:44:10 --> 00:44:11
though.

685
00:44:11 --> 00:44:14
I'll just -- because it's only
one out of zillions,

686
00:44:14 --> 00:44:18
I'm going to put it down and
I'm going to erase it.

687
00:44:18 --> 00:44:23
Another basis for the column
space would be -- let's see.

688
00:44:23 --> 00:44:27
I'll put in some things that
are not there.

689
00:44:27 --> 00:44:31
Say, oh well,
just to make it -- my life

690
00:44:31 --> 00:44:33
easy, 2 2 2.

691
00:44:33 --> 00:44:35
That's in the column space.

692
00:44:35 --> 00:44:39
And, that was sort of obvious.

693
00:44:39 --> 00:44:43
Let me take the sum of those,
say 6 4 6.

694
00:44:43 --> 00:44:47.45
Or the sum of all of the
columns, 7 5 7,

695
00:44:47.45 --> 00:44:48
why not.

696
00:44:48 --> 00:44:50
That's in the column space.

697
00:44:50 --> 00:44:55
Those are independent and I've
got the number right,

698
00:44:55 --> 00:44:57
I've got two.

699
00:44:57 --> 00:45:00
Actually, this is a key point.

700
00:45:00 --> 00:45:06.04
If you know the dimension of
the space you're working with,

701
00:45:06.04 --> 00:45:13
and we know that this column --
we know that the dimension,

702
00:45:13 --> 00:45:18
DIM, the dimension of the
column space is two.

703
00:45:18 --> 00:45:25.55
If you know the dimension,
then -- and we have a couple of

704
00:45:25.55 --> 00:45:32
vectors that are independent,
they'll automatically be a

705
00:45:32 --> 00:45:32
basis.

706
00:45:32 --> 00:45:38
If we've got the number of
vectors right,

707
00:45:38 --> 00:45:42
two vectors in this case,
then if they're independent,

708
00:45:42 --> 00:45:45
they can't help but span the
space.

709
00:45:45 --> 00:45:50.38
Because if they didn't span the
space, there'd be a third guy to

710
00:45:50.38 --> 00:45:54
help span the space,
but it couldn't be independent.

711
00:45:54 --> 00:45:58.25
So, it just has to be
independent if we've got the

712
00:45:58.25 --> 00:46:00
numbers right.

713
00:46:00 --> 00:46:01
And they span.

714
00:46:01 --> 00:46:01
OK.

715
00:46:01 --> 00:46:02
Very good.

716
00:46:02 --> 00:46:05
So you got the dimension of a
space.

717
00:46:05 --> 00:46:09
So this was another basis that
I just invented.

718
00:46:09 --> 00:46:09
OK.

719
00:46:09 --> 00:46:13
Now, now I get to ask about the
null space.

720
00:46:13 --> 00:46:17.82
What's the dimension of the
null space?

721
00:46:17.82 --> 00:46:22
So we, we got a great fact
there, the dimension of the

722
00:46:22 --> 00:46:25
column space is the rank.

723
00:46:25 --> 00:46:29.34
Now I want to ask you about the
null space.

724
00:46:29.34 --> 00:46:35
That's the other part of the
lecture, and it'll go on to the

725
00:46:35 --> 00:46:36
next lecture.

726
00:46:36 --> 00:46:36.54
OK.

727
00:46:36.54 --> 00:46:41
So we know the dimension of the
column space is two,

728
00:46:41 --> 00:46:43
the rank.

729
00:46:43 --> 00:46:45
What about the null space?

730
00:46:45 --> 00:46:48
This is a vector in the null
space.

731
00:46:48 --> 00:46:51
Are there other vectors in the
null space?

732
00:46:51 --> 00:46:51
Yes or no?

733
00:46:51 --> 00:46:52
Yes.

734
00:46:52 --> 00:46:55
So this isn't a basis because
it's doesn't span,

735
00:46:55 --> 00:46:56
right?

736
00:46:56 --> 00:47:01
There's more in the null space
than we've got so far.

737
00:47:01 --> 00:47:03
I need another vector at least.

738
00:47:03 --> 00:47:06
So tell me another vector in
the null space.

739
00:47:06 --> 00:47:10
Well, the natural choice,
the choice you naturally think

740
00:47:10 --> 00:47:14
of is I'm going on to the fourth
column, I'm letting that free

741
00:47:14 --> 00:47:18
variable be a one,
and that free variable be a

742
00:47:18 --> 00:47:22
zero, and I'm asking is that
fourth column a combination of

743
00:47:22 --> 00:47:24
my pivot columns?

744
00:47:24 --> 00:47:25
Yes, it is.

745
00:47:25 --> 00:47:28
And it's -- that will do.

746
00:47:28 --> 00:47:34
So what I've written there are
actually the two special

747
00:47:34 --> 00:47:36
solutions, right?

748
00:47:36 --> 00:47:42
I took the two free variables,
free and free.

749
00:47:42 --> 1.
I gave them the values 1 0 or 0

750
1. --> 00:47:46


751
00:47:46 --> 00:47:48
I figured out the rest.

752
00:47:48 --> 00:47:52
So do you see,
let me just say it in words.

753
00:47:52 --> 00:47:55
This vector,
these vectors in the null space

754
00:47:55 --> 00:47:58
are telling me,
they're telling me the

755
00:47:58 --> 00:48:01
combinations of the columns that
give zero.

756
00:48:01 --> 00:48:07
They're telling me in what way
the, the columns are dependent.

757
00:48:07 --> 00:48:10
That's what the null space is
doing.

758
00:48:10 --> 00:48:11
Have I got enough now?

759
00:48:11 --> 00:48:13
And what's the null space now?

760
00:48:13 --> 00:48:16.35
We have to think about the null
space.

761
00:48:16.35 --> 00:48:19
These are two vectors in the
null space.

762
00:48:19 --> 00:48:20.46
They're independent.

763
00:48:20.46 --> 00:48:23
Are they a basis for the null
space?

764
00:48:23 --> 00:48:26.35
What's the dimension of the
null space?

765
00:48:26.35 --> 00:48:30
You see that those questions
just keep coming up all the

766
00:48:30 --> 00:48:30
time.

767
00:48:30 --> 00:48:33
Are they a basis for the null
space?

768
00:48:33 --> 00:48:37
You can tell me the answer even
though we haven't written out a

769
00:48:37 --> 00:48:38
proof of that.

770
00:48:38 --> 00:48:39
Can you?

771
00:48:39 --> 00:48:40
Yes or no?

772
00:48:40 --> 00:48:45
Do these two special solutions
form a basis for the null space?

773
00:48:45 --> 00:48:48
In other words,
does the null space consist of

774
00:48:48 --> 00:48:50
all combinations of those two
guys?

775
00:48:50 --> 00:48:51
Yes or no?

776
00:48:51 --> 00:48:51.87
Yes.

777
00:48:51.87 --> 00:48:52
Yes.

778
00:48:52 --> 00:48:54.57
The null space is two
dimensional.

779
00:48:54.57 --> 00:48:57
The null space,
the dimension of the null

780
00:48:57 --> 00:49:01
space, is the number of free
variables.

781
00:49:01 --> 00:49:08
So the dimension of the null
space is the number of free

782
00:49:08 --> 00:49:09
variables.

783
00:49:09 --> 00:49:15
And at the last second,
give me the formula.

784
00:49:15 --> 00:49:20
This is then the key formula
that we know.

785
00:49:20 --> 00:49:26
How many free variables are
there in terms of R,

786
00:49:26 --> 00:49:31
the rank, m --
the number of rows,

787
00:49:31 --> 00:49:34
n, the number of columns?

788
00:49:34 --> 00:49:36.09
What do we get?

789
00:49:36.09 --> 00:49:40
We have n columns,
r of them are pivot columns,

790
00:49:40 --> 00:49:46
so n-r is the number of free
columns, free variables.

791
00:49:46 --> 00:49:50
And now it's the dimension of
the null space.

792
00:49:50 --> 00:49:52
OK.

793
00:49:52 --> 00:49:53.6
That's great.

794
00:49:53.6 --> 00:49:57
That's the key spaces,
their bases,

795
00:49:57 --> 00:49:59
and their dimensions.

796
00:49:59 --> 00:50:02
Thanks.
