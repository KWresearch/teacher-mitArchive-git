<p></p> <p>OK. This is lecture twelve.</p> <p>We've reached twelve lectures. And this one is more than the others about applications of linear algebra.</p> <p>And  I'll confess. When I'm giving you examples of the null space and the  row space, I create a little matrix. You probably see that I just invent  that matrix as I'm going.</p> <p>And I feel a little guilty about it,  because the truth is that real linear algebra uses matrices that come  from somewhere. They're not just, like, randomly invented by the  instructor.</p> <p>They come from applications. They have a definite structure.</p> <p>And anybody who works with them gets, uses that structure.</p> <p>I'll  just report, like, this weekend I was at an event with chemistry  professors. OK, those guys are row reducing matrices, and what matrices  are they working with? Well, their little matrices tell them how much of  each element goes into the -- or each molecule, how many molecules of  each go into a reaction and what comes out.</p> <p>And by row reduction  they get a clearer picture of a complicated reaction. And this weekend  I'm going to -- to a sort of birthday party at Mathworks. So Mathworks  is out Route 9 in Natick.</p> <p>That's where Matlab is created. It's a  very, very successful, software, tremendously successful. And the  conference will be about how linear algebra is used. And so I feel  better today to talk about what I think is the most important model in  applied math.</p> <p>And the discrete version is a graph. So can I draw a  graph? Write down the matrix that's associated with it, and that's a  great source of matrices. You'll see. So a graph is just, so a graph --  to repeat -- has nodes and edges. OK.</p> <p>And I'm going to write down the graph, a graph, so I'm just creating a small graph here.</p> <p>As I mentioned last time, we would be very interested in the graph of all, websites.</p> <p>Or  the graph of all telephones. I mean -- or the graph of all people in  the world. Here let me take just, maybe nodes one two three -- well, I  better put in an -- I'll put in that edge and maybe an edge to, to a  node four, and another edge to node four. How's that? So there's a graph  with four nodes.</p> <p>So n will be four in my -- n equal four nodes.</p> <p>And  the matrix will have m equal the number -- there'll be a row for every  edge, so I've got one two three four five edges. So that will be the  number of rows. And I have to to write down the matrix that I want to, I  want to study, I need to give a direction to every edge, so I know a  plus and a minus direction. So I'll just do that with an arrow. Say from  one to two, one to three, two to three, one to four, three to four.</p> <p>That  just tells me, if I have current flowing on these edges then I know  whether it's -- to count it as positive or negative according as whether  it's with the arrow or against the arrow. But I just drew those arrows  arbitrarily. OK.</p> <p>Because I -- my example is going to come -- the  example I'll -- the words that I will use will be words like potential,  potential difference, currents. In other words, I'm thinking of an  electrical network.</p> <p>But that's just one possibility.</p> <p>My applied math class builds on this example.</p> <p>It could be a hydraulic network, so we could be doing, flow of water, flow of oil.</p> <p>Other examples, this could be a structure.</p> <p>Like  the -- a design for a bridge or a design for a Buckminster Fuller dome.  Or many other possibilities, so many. So l- but let's take potentials  and currents as, as a basic example, and let me create the matrix that  tells you exactly what the graph tells you. So now I'll call it the  incidence matrix, incidence matrix. OK. So let me write it down, and  you'll see, what its properties are.</p> <p>So every row corresponds to an edge.</p> <p>I have five rows from five edges, and let me write down again what this graph looks like.</p> <p>OK,  the first edge, edge one, goes from node one to two. So I'm going to  put in a minus one and a plus one in th- this corresponds to node one  two three and four, the four columns. The five rows correspond -- the  first row corresponds to edge one. Edge one leaves node one and goes  into node two, and that -- and it doesn't touch three and four.</p> <p>Edge two, edge two goes -- oh, I haven't numbered these edges.</p> <p>I  just figured that was probably edge one, but I didn't say so. Let me  take that to be edge one. Let me take this to be edge two. Let me take  this to be edge three. This is edge four. Ho, I'm discovering -- no,  wait a minute.</p> <p>Did I number that twice? Here's edge four. And  here's edge five. OK? All right. So, so edge one, as I said, goes from  node one to two.</p> <p>Edge two goes from two to three, node two to three, so minus one and one in the second and third columns.</p> <p>Edge three goes from one to three.</p> <p>I'm, I'm tempted to stop for a moment with those three edges.</p> <p>Edges  one two three, those form what would we, what do you call the, the  little, the little, the subgraph formed by edges one, two, and three?  That's a loop. And the number of loops and the position of the loops  will be crucial.</p> <p>OK. Actually, here's a interesting point about  loops. If I look at those rows, corresponding to edges one two three,  and these guys made a loop. You want to tell me -- if I just looked at  that much of the matrix it would be natural for me to ask, are those  rows independent? Are the rows independent? And can you tell from  looking at that if they are or are not independent? Do you see a, a  relation between those three rows? Yes.</p> <p>If I add that row to that row, I get this row.</p> <p>So,  so that's like a hint here that loops correspond to dependent, linearly  dependent column -- linearly dependent rows. OK, let me complete the  incidence matrix. Number four, edge four is going from node one to node  four.</p> <p>And the fifth edge is going from node three to node four.</p> <p>OK. There's my matrix.</p> <p>It came from the five edges and the four nodes.</p> <p>And if I had a big graph, I'd have a big matrix.</p> <p>And what questions do I ask about matrices? Can I ask -- here's the review now.</p> <p>There's a matrix that comes from somewhere.</p> <p>If, if it was a big graph, it would be a large matrix, but a lot of zeros, right? Because every row only has two non-zeros.</p> <p>So the number of -- it's a very sparse matrix.</p> <p>The  number of non-zeros is exactly two times five, it's two m. Every row  only has two non-zeros. And that's with a lot of structure. And -- that  was the point I wanted to begin with, that graphs, that real graphs from  real -- real matrices from genuine problems have structure. OK.</p> <p>We can ask, and because of the structure, we can answer, the, the main questions about matrices.</p> <p>So  first question, what about the null space? So what I asking if I ask  you for the null space of that matrix? I'm asking you if I'm looking at  the columns of the matrix, four columns, and I'm asking you, are those  columns independent? If the columns are independent, then what's in the  null space? Only the zero vector, right? The null space contains --  tells us what combinations of the columns -- it tells us how to combine  columns to get zero.</p> <p>Can -- and is there anything in the null  space of this matrix other than just the zero vector? In other words,  are those four columns independent or dependent? OK. That's our  question.</p> <p>Let me, I don't know if you see the answer.</p> <p>Whether there's -- so let's see.</p> <p>I guess we could do it properly. We could solve Ax=0. So let me solve Ax=0 to find the null space. OK.</p> <p>What's Ax? Can I put x in here in, in little letters? x1, x2, x3, x4, that's -- it's got four columns.</p> <p>Ax  now is that matrix times x. And what do I get for Ax? If the camera can  keep that matrix multiplication there, I'll put the answer here. Ax  equal -- what's the first component of Ax? Can you take that first row,  minus one one zero zero, and multiply by the x, and of course you get  x2-x1. The second row, I get x3-x2. From the third row, I get x3-x1.  From the fourth row, I get x4-x1. And from the fifth row, I get x4-x3.  And I want to know when is the thing zero. This is my equation, Ax=0.  Notice what that matrix A is doing, what we've created a matrix that  computes the differences across every edge, the differences in  potential.</p> <p>Let me even begin to give this interpretation.</p> <p>I'm  going to think of this vector x, which is x1 x2 x3 x4, as the  potentials at the nodes. So I'm introducing a word, potentials at the  nodes. And now if I multiply by A, I get these -- I get these five  components, x2-x1, et cetera. And what are they? They're potential  differences. That's what A computes.</p> <p>If I have potentials at the  nodes and I multiply by A, it gives me the potential differences, the  differences in potential, across the edges. OK.</p> <p>When are those differences all zero? So I'm looking for the null space.</p> <p>Of course, if all the (x)s are zero then I get zero.</p> <p>That,  that just tells me, of course, the zero vector is in the null space.  But w- there's more in the null space. Those columns are -- of A are  dependent, right -- because I can find solutions to that equation. Tell  me -- the null space.</p> <p>Tell me one vector in the null space, so tell me an x, it's got four components, and it makes that thing zero.</p> <p>So  what's a good x to do that? One one one one, constant potential. If the  potentials are constant, then all the potential differences are zero,  and that x is in the null space.</p> <p>What else is in the null space?  If it -- yeah, let me ask you just always, give me a basis for the null  space. A basis for the null space will be just that.1 That's --, that's  it.</p> <p>That's a basis for the null space.</p> <p>The null space is  actually one dimensional, and it's the line of all vectors through that  one. So there's a basis for it, and here is the whole null space.</p> <p>Any  multiple of one one one one, it's the whole line in four dimensional  space. Do you see that that's the null space? So the, so the dimension  of the null space of A is one. And there's a basis for it, and there's  everything that's in it.</p> <p>Good. And what does that mean physically? I mean, what does that mean in the application? That guy in the null space.</p> <p>It  means that the potentials can only be determined up to a constant.  Potential differences are what make current flow. That's what makes  things happen. It's these potential differences that will make something  move in the, in our network, between x2- between node two and node one.  Nothing will move if all potentials are the same. If all potentials are  c, c, c, and c, then nothing will move. So we're, we have this one  parameter, this arbitrary constant that raises or drops all the  potentials.</p> <p>It's like ranking football teams, whatever.</p> <p>We  have a, there's a, there's a constant -- or looking at temperatures,  you know, there's a flow of heat from higher temperature to lower  temperature. If temperatures are equal there's no flow, and therefore we  can measure -- we can measure temperatures by, Celsius or we can start  at absolute zero.</p> <p>And that arbitrary -- it's the same arbitrary  constant that, that was there in calculus. In calculus, right, when you  took the integral, the indefinite integral, there was a plus c, and you  had to set a starting point to know what that c was. So here what often  happens is we fix one of the potentials, like the last one.</p> <p>So a typical thing would be to ground that node.</p> <p>To  set its potential at zero. And if we do that, if we fix that potential  so it's not unknown anymore, then that column disappears and we have  three columns, and those three columns are independent.</p> <p>So I'll leave the column in there, but we'll remember that grounding a node is the way to get it out.</p> <p>And  grounding a node is the way to -- setting a node -- setting a potential  to zero tells us the, the base for all potentials. Then we can compute  the others. OK. But what's the -- now I've talked enough to ask what the  rank of the matrix is? What's the rank then? The rank of the matrix.</p> <p>So we have a five by four matrix.</p> <p>We've located its null space, one dimensional.</p> <p>How many independent columns do we have? What's the rank? It's three.</p> <p>And  the first three columns, or actually any three columns, will be  independent. Any three potentials are independent, good variables. The  fourth potential is not, we need to set, and typically we ground that  node. OK.</p> <p>Rank is three. Rank equals three.</p> <p>OK. Let's see,  do I want to ask you about the column space? The column space is all  combinations of those columns. I could say more about it and I will. Let  me go to the null space of A transpose, because the equation A  transpose y equals zero is probably the most fundamental equation of  applied mathematics. All right, let's talk about that. That deserves our  attention. A transpose y equals zero. Let's -- let me put it on here.  OK. So A transpose y equals zero.</p> <p>So now I'm finding the null space of A transpose.</p> <p>Oh,  and if I ask you its dimension, you could tell me what it is. What's  the dimension of the null space of A transpose? We now know enough to  answer that question. What's the general formula for the dimension of  the null space of A transpose? A transpose, let me even write out A  transpose. This A transpose will be n by m, right? n by m.</p> <p>In this case, it'll be four by five.</p> <p>Those  columns will become rows. Minus one zero minus one minus one zero is  now the first row. The second row of the matrix, one minus one and three  zeros. The third column now becomes the third row, zero one one zero  minus one. And the fourth column becomes the fourth row.</p> <p>OK, good. There's A transpose.</p> <p>That multiplies y, y1 y2 y3 y4 and y5.</p> <p>OK. Now you've had time to think about this question. What's the dimension of the null space, if I set all those -- wow.</p> <p>Usually -- sometime during this semester, I'll drop one of these erasers behind there. That's a great moment.</p> <p>There's  no recovery. There's -- centuries of erasers are back there. OK. OK,  what's the dimension of the null space? Give me the general formula  first in terms of r and m and n.</p> <p>This is like crucial, you -- we  struggled to, to decide what dimension meant, and then we figured out  what it equaled for an m by n matrix of rank r, and the answer was m-r,  right? There are m=5 components, m=5 columns of A transpose. And r of  those columns are pivot columns, because it'll have r pivots.</p> <p>It  has rank r. And m-r are the free ones now for A transpose, so that's  five minus three, so that's two. And I would like to find this null  space. I know its dimension.</p> <p>Now I want to find out a basis for it.</p> <p>And I want to understand what this equation is.</p> <p>So let me say what A transpose y actually represents, why I'm interested in that equation.</p> <p>I'll put it down with those old erasers and continue this.</p> <p>Here's the great picture of applied mathematics.</p> <p>So let me complete that. There's a matrix that I'll call C that connects potential differences to currents.</p> <p>So  I'll call these -- these are currents on the edges, y1 y2 y3 y4 and y5.  Those are currents on the edges. And this relation between current and  potential difference is Ohm's Law.</p> <p>This here is Ohm's Law. Ohm's  Law says that the current on an edge is some number times the potential  drop. That's -- and that number is the conductance of the edge, one over  the resistance. This is the old current is, is, the relation of  current, resistance, and change in potential. So it's a change in  potential that makes some current happen, and it's Ohm's Law that says  how much current happens. OK.</p> <p>And then the final step of this  framework is the equation A transpose y equals zero. And that's -- what  is that saying? It has a famous name.</p> <p>It's Kirchoff's Current  Law, KCL, Kirchoff's Current Law, A transpose y equals zero. So that  when I'm solving, and when I go back up with this blackboard and solve A  transpose y equals zero, it's this pattern of -- that I want you to  see. That we had rectangular matrices, but -- and real applications, but  in those real applications comes A and A transpose.</p> <p>So our four subspaces are exactly the right things to know about. All right.</p> <p>Let's know about that null space of A transpose.</p> <p>Wait a minute, where'd it go? There it is. OK.</p> <p>OK. Null space of A transpose.</p> <p>We know what its dimension should be.</p> <p>Let's find out -- tell me a vector in it.</p> <p>Tell  me -- now, so what I asking you? I'm asking you for five currents that  satisfy Kirchoff's Current Law. So we better understand what that law  says. That, that law, A transpose y equals zero, what does that say, say  in the first row of A transpose? That says -- the so the first row of A  transpose says minus y1 minus y3 minus y4 is zero. Where did that  equation come from? Let me -- I'll redraw the graph. Can I redraw the  graph here, so that we -- maybe here, so that we see again -- there was  node one, node two, node three, node four was off here. That was, that  was our graph.</p> <p>We had currents on those. We had a current y1  going there. We had a current y -- what were the other, what are those  edge numbers? y4 here and y3 here. And then a y2 and a y5.</p> <p>I'm,  I'm just copying what was on the other board so it's ea- convenient to  see it. What is this equation telling me, this first equation of  Kirchoff's Current Law? What does that mean for that graph? Well, I see  y1, y3, and y4 as the currents leaving node one. So sure enough, the  first equation refers to node one, and what does it say? It says that  the net flow is zero.</p> <p>That, that equation A transpose y, Kirchoff's Current Law, is a balance equation, a conservation law.</p> <p>Physicists, be overjoyed, right, by this stuff.</p> <p>It,  it says that in equals out. And in this case, the three arrows are all  going out, so it says y1, y3, and y4 add to zero. Let's take the next  one.</p> <p>The second row is y1-y2, and that's all that's in that row.  And that must have something to do with node two. And sure enough, it  says y1=y2, current in equals current out. The third one, y2 plus y3  minus y5 equals zero. That certainly will be what's up at the third  node. y2 coming in, y3 coming in, y5 going out has to balance.</p> <p>And  finally, y4 plus y5 equals zero says that at this node, y4 plus y5, the  total flow, is zero. We don't -- you know, charge doesn't accumulate at  the nodes.</p> <p>It travels around. OK.</p> <p>Now give me -- I come back now to the linear algebra question.</p> <p>What's  a vector y that solves these equations? Can I figure out what the null  space is for this matrix, A transpose, by looking at the graph? I'm  happy if I don't have to do elimination. I can do elimination, we know  how to do, we know how to find the null space basis.</p> <p>We can do  elimination on this matrix, and we'll get it into a good reduced row  echelon form, and the special solutions will pop right out. But I would  like to -- even to do it without that. Let me just ask you first, if I  did elimination on that, on that, matrix, what would the last row  become? What would the last row -- if I do elimination on that matrix,  the last row of R will be all zeros, right? Why? Because the rank is  three. We only going to have three pivots. And the fourth row will be  all zeros when we eliminate. So elimination will tell us what, what we  spotted earlier, what's the null space -- all the, all the information,  what are the dependencies. We'll find those by elimination, but here in a  real example, we can find them by thinking.</p> <p>OK. Again, my  question is, what is a solution y? How could current travel around this  network without collecting any charge at the nodes? Tell me a y. OK.</p> <p>So a basis for the null space of A transpose.</p> <p>How many vectors I looking for? Two.</p> <p>It's a two dimensional space. My basis should have two vectors in it. Give me one.</p> <p>One set of currents. Suppose, let me start it.</p> <p>Let me start with y1 as one. OK.</p> <p>So  one unit of -- one amp travels on edge one with the arrow. OK, then  what? What is y2? It's one also, right? And of course what you did was  solve Kirchoff's Current Law quickly in the second equation.</p> <p>OK. Now we've got one amp leaving node one, coming around to node three.</p> <p>What  shall we do now? Well, what shall I take for y3 in other words? Oh,  I've got a choice, but why not make it what you said, negative one.</p> <p>So I have just sent current, one amp, around that loop.</p> <p>What  shall y4 and y5 be in this case? We could take them to be zero. This  satisfies Kirchoff's Current Law. We could check it patiently, that  minus y1 minus y3 gives zero.</p> <p>We know y1 is y2. The others, y4  plus y5 is certainly zero. Any current around a loop satisfies --  satisfies the Current Law. OK. Now you know how to get another one. Take  current around this loop. So now let y3 be one, y5 be one, and y4 be  minus one.</p> <p>And so, so we have the first basis vector sent current  around that loop, the second basis vector sends current around that  loop. And I've -- and those are independent, and I've got two solutions  -- two vectors in the null space of A transpose, two solutions to  Kirchoff's Current Law.</p> <p>Of course you would say what about  sending current around the big loop. What about that vector? One for y1,  one for y2, nothing f- on y3, one for y5, and minus one for y4. What  about that? Is that, is that in the null space of A transpose? Sure.</p> <p>So  why don't we now have a third vector in the basis? Because it's not  independent, right? It's not independent. This vector is the sum of  those two. If I send current around that and around that -- then on this  edge y3 it's going to cancel out and I'll have altogether current  around the whole, the outside loop. That's what this one is, but it's a  combination of those two.</p> <p>Do you see that I've now, I've  identified the null space of A transpose -- but more than that, we've  solved Kirchoff's Current Law.</p> <p>And understood it in terms of the network.</p> <p>OK.  So that's the null space of A transpose. I guess I -- there's always  one more space to ask you about. Let's see, I guess I need the row space  of A, the column space of A transpose. So what's N, what's its  dimension? Yup? What's the dimension of the row space of A? If I look at  the original A, it had five rows.</p> <p>How many were independent? Oh,  I guess I'm asking you the rank again, right? And the answer is three,  right? Three independent rows. When I transpose it, there's three  independent columns. Are those columns independent, those three? The  first three columns, are they the pivot columns of the matrix? No. Those  three columns are not independent. There's a in fact, this tells me a  relation between them. There's a vector in the null space that says the  first column plus the second column equals the third column.</p> <p>They're  not independent because they come from a loop. So the pivot columns,  the pivot columns of this matrix will be the first, the second, not the  third, but the fourth. One, columns one, two, and four are OK. Where are  they -- those are the columns of A transpose, those correspond to  edges.</p> <p>So there's edge one, there's edge two, and there's edge four. So there's a -- that's like -- is a, smaller graph.</p> <p>If  I just look at the part of the graph that I've, that I've, thick --  used with thick edges, it has the same four nodes. It only has three  edges.</p> <p>And the, those edges correspond to the independent guys.  And in the graph there -- those three edges have no loop, right? The  independent ones are the ones that don't have a loop. All the --  dependencies came from loops. They were the things in the null space of A  transpose. If I take three pivot columns, there are no dependencies  among them, and they form a graph without a loop, and I just want to ask  you what's the name for a graph without a loop? So a graph without a  loop is -- has got not very many edges, right? I've got four nodes and  it only has three edges, and if I put another edge in, I would have a  loop. So it's this graph with no loops, and it's the one where the rows  of A are independent.</p> <p>And what's a graph called that has no  loops? It's called a tree. So a tree is the name for a graph with no  loops. And just to take one last step here. Using our formula for  dimension. Using our formula for dimension, let's look -- once at this  formula.</p> <p>The dimension of the null space of A transpose is m-r.</p> <p>OK. This is the number of loops, number of independent loops. m is the number of edges.</p> <p>And  what is r? What is r for our -- we'll have to remember way back. The  rank came -- from looking at the columns of our matrix. So what's the  rank? Let's just remember. Rank was -- you remember there was one -- we  had a one dimensional -- rank was n minus one, that's what I'm  struggling to say. Because there were n columns coming from the n nodes,  so it's minus, the number of nodes minus one, because of that C, that  one one one one vector in the null space.</p> <p>The columns were not independent.</p> <p>There was one dependency, so we needed n minus one.</p> <p>This  is a great formula. This is like the first shall I, -- write it  slightly differently? The number of edges -- let me put things -- have I  got it right? Number of edges is m, the number -- r- is m-r, OK. So, so  I'm getting -- let me put the number of nodes on the other side. So I  -- the number of nodes -- I'll move that to the other side -- minus the  number of edges plus the number of loops is -- I have minus, minus one  is one.</p> <p>The number of nodes minus the number of edges plus the  number of loops is one. These are like zero dimensional guys. They're  the points on the graph. The edges are like one dimensional things,  they're, they connect nodes. The loops are like two dimensional things.  They have, like, an area. And this count works for every graph.</p> <p>And it's known as Euler's Formula.</p> <p>We see Euler again, that guy never stopped.</p> <p>OK.  And can we just check -- so what I saying? I'm saying that linear  algebra proves Euler's Formula. Euler's Formula is this great topology  fact about any graph. I'll draw, let me draw another graph, let me draw a  graph with more edges and loops. Let me put in lots of -- OK. I just  drew a graph there.</p> <p>So what are the, what are the quantities in  that formula? How many nodes have I got? Looks like five. How many edges  have I got? One two three four five six seven.</p> <p>How many loops have I got? One two three.</p> <p>And Euler's right, I always get one.</p> <p>That,  this formula, is extremely useful in understanding the relation of  these quantities -- the number of nodes, the number of edges, and the  number of loops. OK.</p> <p>Just complete this lecture by completing  this picture, this cycle. So let me come to the -- so this expresses the  equations of applied math. This, let me call these potential  differences, say, E. So E is A x.</p> <p>That's the equation for this step.</p> <p>The  currents come from the potential differences. y is C E. The potential  -- the currents satisfy Kirchoff's Current Law. Those are the equations  of -- with no source terms. Those are the equations of electrical  circuits of many -- those are like the, the most basic three equations.  Applied math comes in this structure. The only thing I haven't got yet  in the picture is an outside source to make something happen.</p> <p>I could add a current source here, I could, I could add external currents going in and out of nodes.</p> <p>I could add batteries in the edges.</p> <p>Those are two ways. If I add batteries in the edges, they, they come into here.</p> <p>Let  me add current sources. If I add current sources, those come in here.  So there's a, there's where current sources go, because the F is a like a  current coming from outside. So we have our edges, we have our graph,  and then I send one amp into this node and out of this node -- and that  gives me, a right-hand side in Kirchoff's Current Law. And can I -- to  complete the lecture, I'm just going to put these three equations  together.</p> <p>So I start with x, my unknown.</p> <p>I multiply by A.  That gives me the potential differences. That was our matrix A that the  whole thing started with. I multiply by C.</p> <p>Those are the physical constants in Ohm's Law.</p> <p>Now I have y. I multiply y by A transpose, and now I have F. So there is the whole thing.</p> <p>There's the basic equation of applied math.</p> <p>Coming  from these three steps, in which the last step is this balance  equation. There's always a balance equation to look for. These are the  -- when I say the most basic equations of applied mathematics -- I  should say, in equilibrium.</p> <p>Time isn't in this problem. I'm not  -- and Newton's Law isn't acting here. I'm, I'm looking at the --  equations when everything has settled down, how do the currents  distribute in the network.</p> <p>And of course there are big codes to  solve the -- this is the basic problem of numerical linear algebra for  systems of equations, because that's how they come. And my final  question. What can you tell me about this matrix A transpose C A? Or  even A transpose A? I'll just close with that question.</p> <p>What do you know about the matrix A transpose A? It is always symmetric, right.</p> <p>OK, thank. So I'll see you Wednesday for a full review of these chapters, and Friday you get to tell me.</p> <p>Thanks.</p>
