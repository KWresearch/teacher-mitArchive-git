<p></p> <p> </p> <p>OK, guys the -- we're almost ready to make this lecture immortal. OK.</p> <p>Are we on? All right.</p> <p>This is an important lecture. It's about projections.</p> <p>Let me start by just projecting a vector b down on a vector a.</p> <p>So  just to so you see what the geometry looks like in when I'm in -- in  just two dimensions, I'd like to find the point along this line so that  line through a is a one-dimensional subspace, so I'm starting with one  dimension. I'd like to find the point on that line closest to a. Can I  just take that problem first and then I'll explain why I want to do it  and why I want to project on other subspaces. So where's the point  closest to b that's on that line? It's somewhere there. And let me  connect that and -- and what's the whole point of my picture now? What's  the -- where does orthogonality come into this picture? The whole point  is that this best point, that's the projection, P, of b onto the line,  where's orthogonality? It's the fact that that's a right angle. That  this -- the error -- this is like how much I'm wrong by -- this is the  difference between b and P, the whole point is -- that's perpendicular  to a.</p> <p>That's got to give us the equation.</p> <p>That's got to tell us -- that's the one fact we know, that's got to tell us where that projection is.</p> <p>Let  me also say, look -- I've drawn a triangle there. So if we were doing  trigonometry we would do like we would have angles theta and distances  that would involve sine theta and cos theta that leads to lousy formulas  compared to linear algebra.</p> <p>The formula that we want comes out  nicely and what's the -- what do we know? We know that P, this  projection, is some multiple of a, right? It's on that line.</p> <p>So we  know it's in that one-dimensional subspace, it's some multiple, let me  call that multiple x, of a. So really it's that number x I'd like to  find. So this is going to be simple in 1-D, so let's just carry it  through, and then see how it goes in high dimensions. OK.</p> <p>The key fact is -- the key to everything is that perpendicular. The fact that a is perpendicular to a is perpendicular to e.</p> <p>Which is (b-ax), xa.</p> <p>I don't care what -- xa. That that equals zero.</p> <p>Do  you see that as the central equation, that's saying that this a is  perpendicular to this -- correction, that's going to tell us what x is.</p> <p>Let me just raise the board and simplify that and out will come x. OK.</p> <p>So  if I simplify that, let's see, I'll move one to -- one term to one  side, the other term will be on the other side, it looks to me like x  times a transpose a is equal to a transpose b. Right? I have a transpose  b as one f- one term, a transpose a as the other, so right away here's  my a transpose a.</p> <p>But it's just a number now. And I divide by it.</p> <p>And I get the answer. x is a transpose b over a transpose a. And P, the projection I wanted, is -- that's the right multiple.</p> <p>That's got a cosine theta built in.</p> <p>But we don't need to look at angles.</p> <p>It's -- we've just got vectors here.</p> <p>And the projection is P is a times that x.</p> <p>Or  x times that a. But I'm really going to -- eventually I'm going to want  that x coming on the right-hand side. So do you see that I've got two  of the three formulas already, right here, I've got the -- that's the  equation -- that leads me to the answer, here's the answer for x, and  here's the projection.</p> <p>OK. can I do add just one more thing to  this one-dimensional problem? One more like lift it up into linear  algebra, into matrices. Here's the last thing I want to do -- but don't  forget those formulas.</p> <p>a transpose b over a transpose a.</p> <p>Actually let's look at that for a moment first.</p> <p>Suppose -- Let me take this next step.</p> <p>So  P is a times x. So can I write that then? P is a times this neat  number, a transpose b over a transpose a. That's our projection. Can I  ask a couple of questions about it, just while we look, get that digest  that formula. Suppose b is doubled.</p> <p>Suppose I change b to two b.  What happens to the projection? So suppose I instead of that vector b  that I drew on the board make it two b, twice as long -- what's the  projection now? It's doubled too, right? It's going to be twice as far,  if b goes twice as far, the projection will go twice as far. And you see  it there.</p> <p>If I put in an extra factor two, then P's got that  factor too. Now what about if I double a? What if I double the vector a  that I'm projecting onto? What changes? The projection doesn't change at  all. Right? Because I'm just -- the line didn't change.</p> <p>If I double a or I take minus a.</p> <p>It's  still that same line. The projection's still in the same place. And of  course if I double a I get a four up above, and I get a four -- an extra  four below, they cancel out, and the projection is the same. OK.</p> <p>So  really, this -- I want to look at this as the projection -- there's a  matrix here. The projection is carried out by some matrix that I'm going  to call the projection matrix. And in other words the projection is  some matrix that acts on this guy b and produces the projection. The  projection P is the projection matrix acting on whatever the input is.  The input is b, the projection matrix is P. OK.</p> <p>Actually you can  tell me right away what this projection matrix is. So this is a pretty  interesting matrix. What matrix is multiplying b? I'm just -- just from  my formula -- I see what P is.</p> <p>P, this projection matrix, is -- what is it? I see a a transpose above, and I see a transpose a below.</p> <p>And those don't cancel. That's not one.</p> <p>Right? That's a matrix.</p> <p>Because  down here, the a transpose a, that's just a number, a transpose a,  that's the length of a squared, and up above is a column times a row.  Column times a row is a matrix. So this is a full-scale n by n matrix,  if I -- if I'm in n dimensions. And it's kind of an interesting one. And  it's the one which if I multiply by b then I get this, you see once  again I'm putting parentheses in different places. I'm putting the  parentheses right there. I'm saying OK, that's really the matrix that  produces this projection.</p> <p>OK. Now, tell me -- all right, what are  the properties of that matrix? I'm just using letters here, a and b, I  could put in numbers, but I think it's -- for once, it's clearer with  letters, because all formulas are simple, a transpose b over a transpose  a -- that's the number that multiplies the a, and then I see wait a  minute, there's a matrix here and what's the rank of that matrix, by the  way? What's the rank of that matrix, yeah -- let me just ask you about  that matrix.</p> <p>Which looks a little strange, a a transpose over this number.</p> <p>But well, I could ask you its column space.</p> <p>Yeah, let me ask you its column space.</p> <p>So  what's the column space of a matrix? If you multiply that matrix by  anything you always get in the column space, right? The column space of a  matrix is when you multiply any vector by that matrix -- any vector b,  by the matrix, you always land in the column space. That's what column  spaces work.</p> <p>Now what space do we always land in? What's the  column space of -- what's the result when I multiply this any vector b  by my matrix? So I have P times b, where I? I'm on that line, right? The  column space, so here are facts about this matrix. The column space of  P, of this projection matrix, is the line through a.</p> <p>And the rank of this matrix is you can all say it at once one.</p> <p>Right. The rank is one. This is a rank one matrix. Actually it's exactly the form that we're familiar with a rank one matrix.</p> <p>A column times a row, that's a rank one matrix, that column is the basis for the column space.</p> <p>Just one dimension. OK.</p> <p>So I know that much about the matrix.</p> <p>But  now there are two more facts about the matrix that I want to notice.  First of all is the matrix symmetric? That's a natural question for  matrices. And the answer is yes.</p> <p>If I take the transpose of this  -- there's a number down there, the transpose of a a transpose is a a  transpose. So P is symmetric.</p> <p>P transpose equals P. So this is a key property.</p> <p>That the projection matrix is symmetric.</p> <p>One more property now and this is the real one.</p> <p>What  happens if I do the projection twice? So I'm looking for something,  some information about P squared. But just give me in terms of that  picture, in terms my picture, I take any vector b, I multiply it by my  projection matrix, and that puts me there, so this is Pb.</p> <p>And now I  project again. What happens now? What happens when I apply the  projection matrix a second time? To this, so I'm applying it once brings  me here and the second time brings me I stay put.</p> <p>Right? The projection for a point on this line the projection is right where it is.</p> <p>The projection is the same point.</p> <p>So  that means that if I project twice, I get the same answer as I did in  the first projection. So those are the two properties that tell me I'm  looking at a projection matrix.</p> <p>It's symmetric and it's square is itself.</p> <p>Because  if I project a second time, it's the same result as the first result.  OK. So that's -- and then here's the exact formula when I know what I'm  projecting onto, that line through a, then I know what P is. So do you  see that I have all the pieces here for projection on a line? Now, and  those -- please remember those.</p> <p>So there are three formulas to remember.</p> <p>The formula for x, the formula for P, which is just ax, and then the formula for capital P, which is the matrix. Good.</p> <p>Good. OK.</p> <p>Now I want to move to more dimensions.</p> <p>So  we're going to have three formulas again but you'll have to -- they'll  be a little different because we won't have a single line but -- a plane  or three-dimensional or a n-dimensional subspace.</p> <p>OK. So now I'll  move to the next question. Maybe -- let me say first why I want this  projection, and then we'll figure out what it is, we'll go completely in  parallel there, and then we'll use it. OK, why do I want this  projection? Well, so why project? It's because I'm as I mentioned last  time this new chapter deals with equations Ax=b may have no solution.</p> <p>So  that's really my problem, that I'm given a bunch of equations probably  too many equations, more equations than unknowns, and I can't solve  them. OK. So what do I do? I solve the closest problem that I can solve.</p> <p>And what's the closest one? Well, ax will always be in the column space of a. That's my problem.</p> <p>My problem is ax has to be in the column space and b is probably not in the column space.</p> <p>So I change b to what? I choose the closest vector in the column space, so I'll solve Ax equal P instead. That one I can do.</p> <p>Where  P is this is the projection of b onto the column space. That's why I  want to be able to do this. Because I have to find a solution here, and  I'm going to put a little hat there to indicate that it's not the x,  it's not the x that doesn't exist, it's the x hat that's best possible.  So I must be able to figure out what's the good projection there.</p> <p>What's  the good right-hand side that is in the column space that's as close as  possible to b and then I'm -- then I know what to do. OK.</p> <p>So now  I've got that problem. So that's why I have the problem again but now  let me say I'm in three dimensions, so I have a plane maybe for example,  and I have a vector b that's not in the plane. And I want to project b  down into the plane. OK.</p> <p>So there's my question. How do I project a  vector and I'm -- what I'm looking for is a nice formula, and I'm  counting on linear algebra to just come out right, a nice formula for  the projection of b into the plane.</p> <p>The nearest point. So this again a right angle is going to be crucial. OK.</p> <p>Now  so what's -- first of all I've got to say what is that plane. To get a  formula I have to tell you what the plane is. How I going to tell you a  plane? I'll tell you a basis for the plane, I'll tell you two vectors a  one and a two that give you a basis for the plane, so that -- let us say  -- say there's an a one and here's an a -- a vector a two.</p> <p>They don't have to be perpendicular.</p> <p>But  they better be independent, because then that tells me the plane. The  plane is the -- is the plane of a one and a two. And actually going back  to my -- to this connection, this plane is a column space, it's the  column space of what matrix? What matrix, so how do I connect the two  questions? I'm thinking how do I project onto a plane and I want to get a  matrix in here.</p> <p>Everything's cleaner if I write it in terms of a matrix.</p> <p>So  what matrix has these -- has that column space? Well of course it's  just the matrix that has a one in the first column and a two in the  second column.</p> <p>Right, just just let's be sure we've got the  question before we get to the answer. So I'm looking for again I'm given  a matrix a with two columns.</p> <p>And really I'm ready once I get to two I'm ready for n.</p> <p>So it could be two columns, it could be n columns.</p> <p>I'll write the answer in terms of the matrix a.</p> <p>And the point will be those two columns describe the plane, they describe the column space, and I want to project.</p> <p>OK. And I'm given a vector b that's probably not in the column space.</p> <p>Of course, if b is in the column space, my projection is simple, it's just b.</p> <p>But  most likely I have an error e, this b minus P part, which is probably  not zero. OK. But the beauty is that I know -- from geometry or I could  get it from calculus or I could get it from linear algebra that that  this this vector -- this is the part of b that's that's perpendicular to  the plane.</p> <p>That e is perpendicular is perpendicular to the plane.</p> <p>If your intuition is saying that that's the crucial fact.</p> <p>That's going to give us the answer.</p> <p>OK. So let me, that's the problem.</p> <p>Now  for the answer. So this is a lecture that's really like moving along.  Because I'm just plotting that problem up there and asking you what  combination -- now, yeah, so what is it? P.</p> <p>What is this  projection P? This is projection P, is some multiple of these basis  guys, right, some multiple of the columns. But I don't like writing out x  one a one plus x two a two, I would rather right that as ax. Well,  actually I should put if I'm really doing everything right, I should put  a little hat on it -- to remember that this x -- that those are the  numbers and I could have a put a hat way back there is right, so this is  this is the projection, P. P is ax bar.</p> <p>And I'm looking for x  bar. So that's what I want an equation for. So now I've got hold of the  problem. The problem is find the right combination of the columns so  that the error vector is perpendicular to the plane. Now let me turn  that into an equation. So I'll raise the board and just turn that --  what we've just done into an equation.</p> <p>So let me I'll write again the main point.</p> <p>The projection is ax b- x hat. And our problem is find x hat.</p> <p>And the key is that b minus ax hat, that's the error.</p> <p>This is the e. Is perpendicular to the plane.</p> <p>That's  got to give me well what I looking for, I'm looking for two equations  now because I've got an x one and an x two. And I'll get two equations  because so this thing e is perpendicular to the plane.</p> <p>So what does that mean? I guess it means it's perpendicular to a one and also to a two.</p> <p>Right,  those are two vectors in the plane and the things that are  perpendicular to the plane are perpendicular to a one and a two. Let me  just repeat.</p> <p>This this guy then is perpendicular to the plane so it's perpendicular to that vector and that vector.</p> <p>Not -- it's perpendicular to that of course.</p> <p>But it's perpendicular to everything I the plane.</p> <p>And the plane is really told me by a one and a two.</p> <p>So  really I have the equations a one transpose b minus ax is zero. And  also a two transpose b minus ax is zero. Those are my two equations.</p> <p>But I want those in matrix form.</p> <p>I want to put those two equations together as a matrix equation and it's just comes out right.</p> <p>Look  at the matrix a transpose. Put a one a one transpose is its first row, a  two transpose is its second row, that multiplies this b-ax, and gives  me the zero and the zero. I'm you see the -- this is one way -- to come  up with this equation. So the equation I'm coming up with is a transpose  b-ax hat is zero. OK.</p> <p>That's my equation. All right.</p> <p>Now I  want to stop for a moment before I solve it and just think about it.  First of all do you see that that equation back in the very first  problem I solved on a line, what was -- what was on a line the matrix a  only had one column, it was just little a.</p> <p>So in the first problem  I solved, projecting on a line, this for capital a you just change that  to little a and you have the same equation that we solved before. a  transpose e equals zero. OK.</p> <p>Now a second thing, second comment.</p> <p>I would like to since I know about these four subspaces, I would like to get them into this picture.</p> <p>So  let me ask the question, what subspace is this thing in? Which of the  four subspaces is that error vector e, this is this is nothing but e --  this is this guy, coming in down perpendicular to the plane. What  subspace is e in? From this equation. Well the equation is saying a  transpose e is zero. So I'm learning here that e is in the null space of  a transpose.</p> <p>Right? That's my equation.</p> <p>And now I just want to see hey of course that that was right.</p> <p>Because  things that are in the null space of a transpose, what do we know about  the null space of a transpose? So that last lecture gave us the sort of  the geometry of these subspaces. And the orthogonality of them.</p> <p>And  do you remember what it was? What on the right side of our big figure  we always have the null space of a transpose and the column space of a,  and they're orthogonal. So e in the null space of a transpose is saying e  is perpendicular to the column space of a. Yes.</p> <p>I just feel OK, the damn thing came out right.</p> <p>The  equation for the equation that I struggled to find for e really said  what I wanted, that the error e is perpendicular to the column space of  a, just right.</p> <p>And from our four fundamental subspaces we knew  that that is the same as that. To say e is in the null space of a  transpose says e's perpendicular to the column space. OK.</p> <p>So we've  got this equation. Now let's just solve it. All right. Let me just  rewrite it as a transpose a x hat equals a transpose b.</p> <p>That's our equation. That gives us x.</p> <p>And  -- allow me to keep remembering the one-dimensional case. The  one-dimensional case, this was little a. So this was just a number,  little a transpose, a transpose a was just a vector row times a column, a  number.</p> <p>And this was a number. And x was the ratio of those  numbers. But now we've got matrices, this one is n by n. a transpose a  is an n by n matrix. OK.</p> <p>So can I move to the next board for the  solution? OK. This is the -- the key equation. Now I'm ready for the  formulas that we have to remember. What's x hat? What's the projection,  what's the projection matrix, those are my three questions. That we  answered in the 1-D case and now we're ready for in the n-dimensional  case.</p> <p>So what is x hat? Well, what can I say but a transpose a  inverse, a transpose b. OK. That's the solution to -- to our equation.  What's the projection? That's more interesting. What's the projection?  The projection is a x hat. That's how x hat got into the picture in the  first place. x hat was the was the combination of columns in the I had  to look for those numbers and now I found them. Was the combination of  the columns of a that gave me the projection.</p> <p>OK. So now I know what this guy is.</p> <p>So  it's just I multiply by a. a a transpose a inverse a transpose b.  That's looking a little messy but it's not bad. That that combination is  is our like magic combination. This is the thing which is which use  which is like what's it like, what was it in one dimension? What was  that we had this we must have had this thing way back at the beginning  of the lecture. What did we -- oh that a was just a column so it was  little a, little a transpose over a transpose a, right, that's what it  was in 1-D.</p> <p>You see what's happened in more dimensions, I -- I'm  not allowed to to just divide because because I don't have a number, I  have to put inverse, because I have an n by n matrix.</p> <p>But same  formula. And now tell me what's the projection matrix? What matrix is  multiplying b to give the projection? Right there.</p> <p>Because there  it -- I even already underlined it by accident. The projection matrix  which I use capital P is this, it's it's that thing, shall I write it  again, a times a transpose a inverse times a transpose. Now if you'll  bear with me I'll think about what have I done here.</p> <p>I've got this  formula. Now the first thing that occurs to me is something bad. Look  why don't I just you know here's a product of two matrices and I want  its inverse, why don't I just use the formula I know for the inverse of a  product and say OK, that's a inverse times a transpose inverse, what  will happen if I do that? What will happen if I say hey this is a  inverse times a transpose inverse, then shall I do it? It's going to go  on videotape if I do it, and I don't -- all right, I'll put it there,  but just like don't take the videotape quite so carefully. OK.</p> <p>So  if I put that thing it -- it would be a a inverse a transpose inverse a  transpose and what's that? That's the identity. But what's going on? So  why -- you see my question is somehow I did something wrong. That that  wasn't allowed.</p> <p>And and and why is that? Because a is not a square  matrix. a is not a square matrix. It doesn't have an inverse. So I have  to leave it that way.</p> <p>This is not OK. If if a was a square invertible matrix, then then I couldn't complain.</p> <p>Yeah I think -- let me think about that case.</p> <p>But  you but my main case, the whole reason I'm doing all this, is that a is  this matrix that has x too many rows, it's just got a couple of  columns, like a one and a two, but lots of rows. Not square.</p> <p>And  if it's not square, this a transpose a is square but I can't pull it  apart like this -- I'm not allowed to do this pull apart, except if a  was square.</p> <p>Now if a is square what's what's going on if a is a square matrix? a nice square inv- invertible matrix. Think.</p> <p>What's up with that what's with that case.</p> <p>So this is that the formula ought to work then too.</p> <p>If  a is a nice square invertible matrix what's its column space, so it's a  nice n by n invertible everything great matrix, what's its column  space, the whole of R^n. So what's the projection matrix if I'm  projecting onto the whole space? It's the identity matrix right? If I'm  projecting b onto the whole space, not just onto a plane, but onto all  of 3-D, then b is already in the column space, the projection is the  identity, and this is gives me the correct formula, P is I. But if I'm  projecting onto a subspace then I can't split those apart and I have to  stay with that formula. OK.</p> <p>And what can I say if -- so I remember this formula for 1-D and that's what it looks like in n dimensions.</p> <p>And  what are the properties that I expected for any projection matrix? And I  still expect for this one? That matrix should be symmetric and it is. P  transpose is P. Because if I transpose this, this guy's symmetric, and  its inverse is symmetric, and if I transpose this one when I transpose  it will pop up there, become a, that a transpose will pop up here, and  I'm back to P again.</p> <p>And do we dare try the other property which is P squared equal P? It's got to be right.</p> <p>Because  we know geometrically that the first projection pops us onto the column  space and the second one leaves us where we are. So I expect that if I  multiply by let me do it -- if I multiply by another P, so there's  another a, another a transpose a inverse a transpose, can you -- eight  (a)-s in a row is quite obscene but -- do you see that it works? So I'm  squaring that so what do I do-- how do I see that multiplication? Well,  yeah, I just want to put parentheses in good places, so I see what's  happening, yeah, here's an a transpose a sitting together -- so when  that a transpose a multiplies its inverse, all that stuff goes, right.</p> <p>And leaves just the a transpose at the end, which is just what we want. So P squared equals P.</p> <p>So sure enough those two properties hold.</p> <p>OK. OK we really have got now all the formulas. x hat, the projection P, and the projection matrix capital P.</p> <p>And  now my job is to use them. OK. So when would I have a bunch of  equations, too many equations and yet I want the best answer and the --  the most important example, the most common example is if I have points  so here's the -- here's the application.</p> <p>v squared. Fitting by a line.</p> <p>OK.  So I'll start this application today and there's more in it than I can  do in this same lecture. So that'll give me a chance to recap the  formulas and there they are, and recap the ideas.</p> <p>So let me start the problem today.</p> <p>I'm given a bunch of data points.</p> <p>And they lie close to a line but not on a line.</p> <p>Let  me take that. Say a t equal to one, two and three, I have one, and two  and two again. So my data points are this is the like the time direction  and this is like well let me call that b or y or something. I'm given  these three points and I want to fit them by a line. By the best  straight line. So the problem is fit the points one, one is the first  point -- the second point is t equals two, b equal one, and the third  point is t equal three, b equal to two.</p> <p>So those are my three points, t equal sorry,that's two.</p> <p>Yeah, OK. So this is the point one, one. This is the point two, two, and that's the point three, two.</p> <p>And of course there isn't a -- a line that goes through them.</p> <p>So I'm looking for the best line.</p> <p>I'm  looking for a line that probably goes somewhere, do you think it goes  somewhere like that? I didn't mean to make it go through that point, it  won't. It'll kind of -- it'll go between so the error there and the  error there and the error there are as small as I can get them. OK, what  I'd like to do is find the matrix a.</p> <p>Because once I've found the matrix a the formulas take over.</p> <p>So what I'm looking for this line, b is C+Dt.</p> <p>So this is in the homework that I sent out for today.</p> <p>Find the best line. So I'm looking for these numbers. C and D.</p> <p>That tell me the line and I want them to be as close to going through those three points as I can get.</p> <p>I  can't get exactly so there are three equations to go through the three  points. It would it will go exactly through that point if let's see that  first point has t equal to one, so that would say C+D equaled 1.</p> <p>This  is the one, one. The second point t is two. So C+2D should come out to  equal 2. But I also want to get the third equation in and at that third  equation t is three so C+3D equals only 2. That's the key. Is to write  down what equations we would like to solve but can't. Reason we if we  could solve them that would mean that we could put a line through all  three points and of course if these numbers one, two, two were  different, we could do it.</p> <p>But with those numbers, one, two, two,  we can't. So what is our equation Ax equal Ax equal b that we can't  solve? I just want to say what's the matrix here, what's the unknown x,  and what's the right-hand side.</p> <p>So this is the matrix is one, one, one, one, two, three. The unknown is C and D.</p> <p>And the right-hand side if one, two, two.</p> <p>Right,  I've just taken my equations and I've said what is Ax and what is b.  Then there's no solution, this is the typical case where I have three  equations -- two unknowns, no solution, but I'm still looking for the  best solution.</p> <p>And the best solution is taken is is to solve not  this equation Ax equal b which has which has no solution but the  equation that does have a solution, which was this one.</p> <p>So that's the equation to solve.</p> <p>That's the central equation of the subject.</p> <p>I  can't solve Ax=b but magically when I multiply both sides by a  transpose I get an equation that I can solve and its solution gives me  x, the best x, the best projection, and I discover what's the matrix  that's behind it. OK.</p> <p>So next time I'll complete an example, numerical example.</p> <p>today was all letters, numbers next time.</p> <p>Thanks.</p>
