1
00:00:07 --> 00:00:07
Okay.

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:09.05
This is it.

3
00:00:09.05 --> 00:00:16
The second lecture in linear
algebra, and I've put below my

4
00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
main topics for today.

5
00:00:18 --> 00:00:25
I put right there a system of
equations that's going to be our

6
00:00:25 --> 00:00:29
example to work with.

7
00:00:29 --> 00:00:32
But what are we going to do
with it?

8
00:00:32 --> 00:00:33
We're going to solve it.

9
00:00:33 --> 00:00:37
And the method of solution will
not be determinants.

10
00:00:37 --> 00:00:41.28
Determinants are something that
will come later.

11
00:00:41.28 --> 00:00:44
The method we'll use is called
elimination.

12
00:00:44 --> 00:00:49
And it's the way every software
package solves equations.

13
00:00:49 --> 00:00:53.75
And elimination,
well, if it succeeds,

14
00:00:53.75 --> 00:00:55.93
it gets the answer.

15
00:00:55.93 --> 00:00:59
And normally it does succeed.

16
00:00:59 --> 00:01:05
If the matrix A that's coming
into that system is a good

17
00:01:05 --> 00:01:13
matrix, and I think this one is,
then elimination will work.

18
00:01:13 --> 00:01:15
We'll get the answer in an
efficient way.

19
00:01:15 --> 00:01:18
But why don't we,
as long as we're sort of seeing

20
00:01:18 --> 00:01:22
how elimination works -- it's
always good to ask how could it

21
00:01:22 --> 00:01:22
fail?

22
00:01:22 --> 00:01:25
So at the same time,
we'll see how elimination

23
00:01:25 --> 00:01:29
decides whether the matrix is a
good one or has problems.

24
00:01:29 --> 00:01:34
Then to complete the answer,
there's an obvious step of back

25
00:01:34 --> 00:01:36
substitution.

26
00:01:36 --> 00:01:40
In fact, the idea of
elimination is -- you would have

27
00:01:40 --> 00:01:42
thought of it,
right?

28
00:01:42 --> 00:01:45
I mean Gauss thought of it
before we did,

29
00:01:45 --> 00:01:50
but only because he was born
earlier.

30
00:01:50 --> 00:01:54
It's a natural idea...
and died earlier,

31
00:01:54 --> 00:01:55
too.

32
00:01:55 --> 00:01:58
Okay, and you've seen the idea.

33
00:01:58 --> 00:02:05
But now, the part that I want
to show you is elimination

34
00:02:05 --> 00:02:13
expressed in matrix language,
because the whole course --

35
00:02:13 --> 00:02:18
all the key ideas get expressed
as matrix operations,

36
00:02:18 --> 00:02:20
not as words.

37
00:02:20 --> 00:02:25
And one of the operations,
of course, that we'll meet is

38
00:02:25 --> 00:02:29
how do we multiply matrices and
why?

39
00:02:29 --> 00:02:33
Okay, so there's a system of
equations.

40
00:02:33 --> 00:02:38
Three equations and three
unknowns.

41
00:02:38 --> 00:02:42
And there's the matrix,
the three by three matrix -- so

42
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
this is the system Ax = b.

43
00:02:44 --> 00:02:49
This is our system to solve,
Ax equal -- and the right-hand

44
00:02:49 --> 00:02:51
side is that vector 2,
12, 2.

45
00:02:51 --> 00:02:52
Okay.

46
00:02:52 --> 00:02:56
Now, when I describe
elimination -- it gets to be a

47
00:02:56 --> 00:03:02
pain to keep writing the equal
signs and the pluses and so on.

48
00:03:02 --> 00:03:05
It's that matrix that totally
matters.

49
00:03:05 --> 00:03:08
Everything is in that matrix.

50
00:03:08 --> 00:03:12
But behind it is those
equations.

51
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15.12
So what does elimination do?

52
00:03:15.12 --> 00:03:18.86
What's the first step of
elimination?

53
00:03:18.86 --> 00:03:23
We accept the first equation,
it's okay.

54
00:03:23 --> 00:03:28
I'm going to multiply that
equation by the right number,

55
00:03:28 --> 00:03:32
the right multiplier and I'm
going to subtract it from the

56
00:03:32 --> 00:03:33.85
second equation.

57
00:03:33.85 --> 00:03:35
With what purpose?

58
00:03:35 --> 00:03:39
So that will decide what the
multiplier should be.

59
00:03:39 --> 00:03:43
Our purpose is to knock out the
x part of equation two.

60
00:03:43 --> 00:03:47.47
So our purpose is to eliminate
x.

61
00:03:47.47 --> 00:03:53
So what do I multiply -- and
again, I'll do it with this

62
00:03:53 --> 00:03:57
matrix, because I can do it
short.

63
00:03:57 --> 00:04:00
What's the multiplier here?

64
00:04:00 --> 00:04:06
What do I multiply -- equation
one and subtract.

65
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
Notice I'm saying that word
subtract.

66
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
I'd like to stick to that
convention.

67
00:04:10 --> 00:04:12
I'll do a subtraction.

68
00:04:12 --> 00:04:16
First of all this is the key
number that I'm starting with.

69
00:04:16 --> 00:04:18.04
And that's called the pivot.

70
00:04:18.04 --> 00:04:21
I'll put a box around it and
write its name down.

71
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
That's the first pivot.

72
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
The first pivot.

73
00:04:25 --> 00:04:25
Okay.

74
00:04:25 --> 00:04:31
So I'm going to use -- that's
sort of like the key number in

75
00:04:31 --> 00:04:32
that equation.

76
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
And now what's the multiplier?

77
00:04:35 --> 00:04:39.28
So I'm going to -- my first row
won't change,

78
00:04:39.28 --> 00:04:42
that's the pivot row.

79
00:04:42 --> 00:04:46
But I'm going to use it -- and
now, finally,

80
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
let me ask you what the
multiplier is.

81
00:04:49 --> 3.
Yes?

82
3. --> 00:04:50


83
00:04:50 --> 00:04:54
3 times that first equation
will knock out that 3.

84
00:04:54 --> 00:04:55
Okay.

85
00:04:55 --> 00:04:57
So what will it leave?

86
00:04:57 --> 00:05:02
So the multiplier is 3.
3 times that will make that 0.

87
00:05:02 --> 00:05:07.1
That was our purpose.
3 2s away from the 8 will leave

88
00:05:07.1 --> 00:05:11
a 2 and three 1s away from 1
will leave a minus 2.

89
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13.23
And this guy didn't change.

90
00:05:13.23 --> 00:05:13
Okay.

91
00:05:13 --> 00:05:18.15
Now the next step -- this is
forward elimination and that

92
00:05:18.15 --> 00:05:20
step's completed.

93
00:05:20 --> 00:05:24
Oh, well, you could say wait a
minute, what about the right

94
00:05:24 --> 00:05:24
hand side?

95
00:05:24 --> 00:05:28
Shall I carry -- the right-hand
side gets carried along.

96
00:05:28 --> 00:05:32
Actually MatLab finishes up
with the left side before -- and

97
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
then just goes back to do the
right side.

98
00:05:35 --> 00:05:39
Maybe I'll be MatLab for a
moment and do that.

99
00:05:39 --> 00:05:40
Okay.

100
00:05:40 --> 00:05:45
I'm leaving a room for a column
of b, the right-hand side.

101
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
But I'll fill it in later.

102
00:05:48 --> 00:05:48.52
Okay.

103
00:05:48.52 --> 00:05:53
Now the next step of
elimination is what?

104
00:05:53 --> 00:05:58
Well, strictly speaking...
this position that I cleaned up

105
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
was like the 2,
1 position, row 2,

106
00:06:01 --> 00:06:02
column 1.

107
00:06:02 --> 00:06:05
So I got a 0 in the 2,
1 position.

108
00:06:05 --> 00:06:10
I'll use 2,1 as the index of
that step.

109
00:06:10 --> 00:06:16
The next step should be to
finish the column and get a 0 in

110
00:06:16 --> 00:06:17
that position.

111
00:06:17 --> 00:06:23.06
So the next step is really the
3,1 step, row three,

112
00:06:23.06 --> 00:06:24
column one.

113
00:06:24 --> 00:06:27
But of course,
I already have 0.

114
00:06:27 --> 00:06:27
Okay.

115
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
So the multiplier is 0.

116
00:06:30 --> 00:06:37
I take 0 of this equation away
from this one and I'm all set.

117
00:06:37 --> 00:06:41
So I won't repeat that,
but there was a step there

118
00:06:41 --> 00:06:46
which, MatLab would have to look
-- it would look at this number

119
00:06:46 --> 00:06:50
and, do that step,
unless you told it in advance

120
00:06:50 --> 00:06:51
that it was 0.

121
00:06:51 --> 00:06:51
Okay.

122
00:06:51 --> 00:06:52
Now what?

123
00:06:52 --> 00:06:57
Now we can see the second
pivot, which is what?

124
00:06:57 --> 00:07:01
The second pivot -- see,
we've eliminated -- x is now

125
00:07:01 --> 00:07:04
gone from this equation,
right?

126
00:07:04 --> 00:07:07
We're down to two equations in
y and z.

127
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09.97
And so now I just do it again.

128
00:07:09.97 --> 00:07:15
Like, everything's very cursive
at this -- this is like --

129
00:07:15 --> 00:07:18
such a basic algorithm and
you've seen it,

130
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
but carry me through one last
step.

131
00:07:21 --> 00:07:24.11
So this is still the first
pivot.

132
00:07:24.11 --> 00:07:28
Now the second pivot is this
guy, who has appeared there.

133
00:07:28 --> 00:07:33
And what's the multiplier,
the appropriate multiplier now?

134
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
And what's my purpose?

135
00:07:36 --> 00:07:41
Is it to wipe out the 3,
2 position, right?

136
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
This was the 2,
1 step.

137
00:07:44 --> 00:07:49
And now I'm going to take the
3, 2 step.

138
00:07:49 --> 00:07:55.79
So this all stays the same,
1 2 1, 0 2 -1 and the pivots

139
00:07:55.79 --> 00:07:58
are there.

140
00:07:58 --> 00:08:04
Now I'm using this pivot,
so what's the multiplier?

141
00:08:04 --> 2.


142
2. --> 00:08:06
2 times this equation,

143
00:08:06 --> 00:08:13
this row, gets subtracted from
this row and makes that a 0.

144
00:08:13 --> 00:08:16
So it's 0, 0 and is it a 5?

145
00:08:16 --> 00:08:22
Yeah, I guess it's a 5,
is that right?

146
00:08:22 --> 00:08:28
Because I have a one there and
I'm subtracting twice of twice

147
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
this, so I think it's a 5 there.

148
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
There's the third pivot.

149
00:08:33 --> 00:08:37
So let me put a box around all
three pivots.

150
00:08:37 --> 00:08:42
Is there a -- oh,
did I just invent a negative

151
00:08:42 --> 00:08:42.83
one?

152
00:08:42.83 --> 00:08:48
I'm sorry that the tape can't,
correct that as easily as I

153
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
can.

154
00:08:50 --> 00:08:50
Okay.

155
00:08:50 --> 00:08:53
Thank you very much.

156
00:08:53 --> 00:08:58
You get an A in the course now.

157
00:08:58 --> 00:09:01.27
Is that correct?

158
00:09:01.27 --> 00:09:04
Is it correct now?

159
00:09:04 --> 00:09:04
Okay.

160
00:09:04 --> 00:09:14
So the three pivots are there
-- I know right away a lot about

161
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
this matrix.

162
00:09:17 --> 00:09:22
This elimination step from A --
this matrix I'm going to call U.

163
00:09:22 --> 00:09:23
U for upper triangular.

164
00:09:23 --> 00:09:27
So the whole purpose of
elimination was to get from A to

165
00:09:27 --> 00:09:28
U.

166
00:09:28 --> 00:09:30
And, literally,
that's the most common

167
00:09:30 --> 00:09:33.37
calculation in scientific
computing.

168
00:09:33.37 --> 00:09:37
And people think of how could I
do that faster?

169
00:09:37 --> 00:09:40
Because it's a major,
major thing.

170
00:09:40 --> 00:09:44
But we're doing it the
straightforward way.

171
00:09:44 --> 00:09:48.05
We found three pivots,
and by the way,

172
00:09:48.05 --> 00:09:51
I didn't say this,
pivots can't be 0.

173
00:09:51 --> 00:09:54
I don't accept 0 as a pivot.

174
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
And I didn't get 0.

175
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
So this matrix is great.

176
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
It gave me three pivots,
I didn't have to do anything

177
00:10:01 --> 00:10:05
special, I just followed the
rules and, and the pivots are 1,

178
00:10:05 --> 00:10:06.24
2 and 5.

179
00:10:06.24 --> 00:10:09
By the way, just because I
always anticipate stuff from a

180
00:10:09 --> 00:10:13
later day, if I wanted to know
the determinant of this matrix

181
00:10:13 --> 00:10:17
--
which I never do want to know,

182
00:10:17 --> 00:10:21.76
but I would just multiply the
pivots.

183
00:10:21.76 --> 00:10:24
The determinant is 10.

184
00:10:24 --> 00:10:28
So even things like the
determinant are here.

185
00:10:28 --> 00:10:29
Okay.

186
00:10:29 --> 00:10:34
Now -- oh, let me talk about
failure for a moment,

187
00:10:34 --> 00:10:40
and then --
and then come back to success.

188
00:10:40 --> 00:10:44
How could this have failed?

189
00:10:44 --> 00:10:51.45
How could -- by fail,
I mean to come up with three

190
00:10:51.45 --> 00:10:52
pivots.

191
00:10:52 --> 00:10:58
I mean, there are a couple of
points.

192
00:10:58 --> 00:11:02
I would have already been in
trouble if this very first

193
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
number here was 0.

194
00:11:04 --> 00:11:08
If it was a 0 there -- suppose
that had been a 0,

195
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12.74
there were no Xs in that
equation -- first equation.

196
00:11:12.74 --> 00:11:16
Does that mean I can't solve
the problem?

197
00:11:16 --> 00:11:17
Does that mean I quit?

198
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
No.

199
00:11:19 --> 00:11:19
What do I do?

200
00:11:19 --> 00:11:20
I switch rows.

201
00:11:20 --> 00:11:21
I exchange rows.

202
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
So in case of a 0,
I will not say 0 pivot.

203
00:11:24 --> 00:11:28
I will never be heard to utter
those words, 0 pivot.

204
00:11:28 --> 00:11:32
But if there's a 0 in the pivot
position, maybe I can say that,

205
00:11:32 --> 00:11:36
I would try to exchange for a
lower equation and get a proper

206
00:11:36 --> 00:11:37
pivot up there.

207
00:11:37 --> 00:11:38
Okay.

208
00:11:38 --> 00:11:43
Now, for example,
this second pivot came out two.

209
00:11:43 --> 00:11:46.04
Could it have come out 0?

210
00:11:46.04 --> 00:11:50.63
What -- actually,
if I change that 8 a little

211
00:11:50.63 --> 00:11:55
bit, I would have got a little
trouble.

212
00:11:55 --> 00:12:02
What should I change that 8 to
so that I run into trouble?

213
00:12:02 --> 00:12:02
A 6.

214
00:12:02 --> 00:12:08
If that had been a 6,
then this would have been 0 and

215
00:12:08 --> 00:12:13
I couldn't have used that as the
pivot.

216
00:12:13 --> 00:12:17
But I could have exchanged
again.

217
00:12:17 --> 00:12:19
In this case.

218
00:12:19 --> 00:12:23
In this case,
because when can I get out of

219
00:12:23 --> 00:12:24
trouble?

220
00:12:24 --> 00:12:29
I can get out of trouble if
there's a non-0 below this

221
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31.36
troublesome 0.

222
00:12:31.36 --> 00:12:33
And there is here.

223
00:12:33 --> 00:12:37
So I would be okay in this
case.

224
00:12:37 --> 00:12:40
If this was a 6,
I would survive by a row

225
00:12:40 --> 00:12:40
exchange.

226
00:12:40 --> 00:12:44
Now -- of course,
it might have happened that I

227
00:12:44 --> 00:12:47.96
couldn't do the row,
that -- that there was 0s below

228
00:12:47.96 --> 00:12:49
it, but here there wasn't.

229
00:12:49 --> 00:12:54
Now, I could also have got in
trouble if this number 1 was a

230
00:12:54 --> 00:12:55
little different.

231
00:12:55 --> 00:12:59
See, that 1 became a 5,
I guess, by the end.

232
00:12:59 --> 00:13:05
So can you see what number
there would have got me trouble

233
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
that I really couldn't get out
of?

234
00:13:09 --> 00:13:16
Trouble that I couldn't get out
of would mean if 0 is in the

235
00:13:16 --> 00:13:22
pivot position and I've got no
place to exchange.

236
00:13:22 --> 00:13:28
So there must be some number
which if I had had here it would

237
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
have meant failure.

238
00:13:30 --> 00:13:32
Negative 4, good.

239
00:13:32 --> 00:13:37
If it was a negative 4 here --
if it happened to be a negative

240
00:13:37 --> 00:13:41.89
4, I'll temporarily put it up
here.

241
00:13:41.89 --> 00:13:46
If this had been a negative 4
z, then I would have gone

242
00:13:46 --> 00:13:47
through the same steps.

243
00:13:47 --> 00:13:52
This would have been a minus 4,
it still would have been a

244
00:13:52 --> 00:13:52
minus 4.

245
00:13:52 --> 00:13:56
But at the last minute it would
have become 0.

246
00:13:56 --> 00:14:00
And there wouldn't have been a
third pivot.

247
00:14:00 --> 00:14:03
The matrix would have not been
invertible.

248
00:14:03 --> 00:14:06
Well, of course,
the inverse of a matrix is

249
00:14:06 --> 00:14:09
coming next week,
but, you've heard these words

250
00:14:09 --> 00:14:09
before.

251
00:14:09 --> 00:14:12
So, that's how we identify
failure.

252
00:14:12 --> 00:14:17
There's temporary failure when
we can do a row exchange --

253
00:14:17 --> 00:14:21.26
and get out of it,
or there's complete failure

254
00:14:21.26 --> 00:14:26
when we get a 0 and -- and
there's nothing below that we

255
00:14:26 --> 00:14:27
can use.

256
00:14:27 --> 00:14:27
Okay.

257
00:14:27 --> 00:14:31
Let's stay with -- back to
success now.

258
00:14:31 --> 00:14:36
In fact, I guess the next topic
is back substitution.

259
00:14:36 --> 00:14:39
So what's back substitution?

260
00:14:39 --> 00:14:44.57
Well, now I'd better bring the
right-hand side in.

261
00:14:44.57 --> 00:14:49
So what would MatLab do and
what should we do?

262
00:14:49 --> 00:14:54
Let me bring in the right-hand
side as an extra column.

263
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
So there comes B.

264
00:14:56 --> 2.
So it's 2, 12,

265
2. --> 00:14:58


266
00:14:58 --> 00:15:02
I would call this the augmented
matrix.

267
00:15:02 --> 00:15:06
"Augment" means you've tacked
something on.

268
00:15:06 --> 00:15:09
I've tacked on this extra
column.

269
00:15:09 --> 00:15:15
Because, when I'm working with
equations, I do the same thing

270
00:15:15 --> 00:15:17.76
to both sides.

271
00:15:17.76 --> 00:15:21
So, at this step,
I subtracted 2 of the first

272
00:15:21 --> 00:15:26
equation away from the second
equation so that this augmented

273
00:15:26 --> 00:15:32
-- I even brought some colored
chalk, but I don't know if it

274
00:15:32 --> 00:15:32
shows up.

275
00:15:32 --> 00:15:36
So this is like the augmented
-- no!

276
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
Damn, circled the wrong thing.

277
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
Okay.

278
00:15:40 --> 00:15:40.75
Here is b.

279
00:15:40.75 --> 00:15:42
Okay, that's the extra column.

280
00:15:42 --> 00:15:42
Okay.

281
00:15:42 --> 00:15:46
So what happened to that extra
column, the right-hand side of

282
00:15:46 --> 00:15:49
the equations,
when I did the first step?

283
00:15:49 --> 00:15:53
So that was 3 of this away from
this, so it took -- the 2 stayed

284
00:15:53 --> 00:15:56
the same, but three 2s got taken
away from 12,

285
00:15:56 --> 00:15:59
leaving 6, and that 2 stayed
the same.

286
00:15:59 --> 00:16:04
So this is how it's looking
halfway along.

287
00:16:04 --> 00:16:09
And let me just carry to the
end.

288
00:16:09 --> 00:16:16
The 2 and the 6 stay the same,
but -- what do I have here?

289
00:16:16 --> 00:16:17.86
Oh, gosh.

290
00:16:17.86 --> 00:16:19
Help me out,
now.

291
00:16:19 --> 00:16:25
What -- so now I'm --
This is still like forward

292
00:16:25 --> 00:16:26
elimination.

293
00:16:26 --> 00:16:29
I got to this point,
which I think is right,

294
00:16:29 --> 00:16:32.04
and now what did I do at this
step?

295
00:16:32.04 --> 00:16:36
I multiplied that pivot by 2 or
that whole equation by 2 and

296
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
subtracted from that,
so I think I take two 6s,

297
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42.07
which is 12,
away from the 2.

298
00:16:42.07 --> 00:16:47
Do you think minus 10 is my
final right-hand side -- the

299
00:16:47 --> 00:16:54.63
right-hand side that goes with
U, and let me call that once and

300
00:16:54.63 --> 00:16:56
forever the vector c.

301
00:16:56 --> 00:17:02
So c is what happens to b,
and U is what happens to A.

302
00:17:02 --> 00:17:03
Okay.

303
00:17:03 --> 00:17:06
There you've seen elimination
clean.

304
00:17:06 --> 00:17:07
Okay.

305
00:17:07 --> 00:17:11
Oh, what's back substitution?

306
00:17:11 --> 00:17:16
So what are my final equations,
then?

307
00:17:16 --> 00:17:23
Can I copy these equations?
x+2y+z=2 is still there and

308
00:17:23 --> 00:17:27
2y-2z=6 is there,
and 5z=-10.

309
00:17:27 --> 00:17:28
Okay.

310
00:17:28 --> 00:17:36
Those are the equations that
these numbers are telling me

311
00:17:36 --> 00:17:38
about.

312
00:17:38 --> 00:17:42
Those are the equations U x
equals c.

313
00:17:42 --> 00:17:45
Okay, how do I solve them?

314
00:17:45 --> 00:17:49
What one do I solve for first?
z.

315
00:17:49 --> 00:17:56
I see immediately that the
correct value of z is negative

316
00:17:56 --> 2.


317
2. --> 00:17:56


318
00:17:56 --> 00:17:59
And what do I do next?

319
00:17:59 --> 00:18:02
I go back upwards.

320
00:18:02 --> 00:18:04
I now know z here.

321
00:18:04 --> 00:18:08
So, if z is negative 2,
that's 4 there,

322
00:18:08 --> 00:18:10
is that right?

323
00:18:10 --> 00:18:14.63
And so 2 y plus a 4 is 6,
maybe y is 1.

324
00:18:14.63 --> 00:18:18
Going -- this is back
substitution.

325
00:18:18 --> 00:18:23.62
We're doing it on the fly
because it's so easy.

326
00:18:23.62 --> 00:18:29
And then x is --
so x -- 2y is 2 minus 2,

327
00:18:29 --> 00:18:30
maybe x is 2?

328
00:18:30 --> 00:18:34
So you see what back
substitution is.

329
00:18:34 --> 00:18:40
It's the simple step solving
the equations in reverse order

330
00:18:40 --> 00:18:43
because the system is
triangular.

331
00:18:43 --> 00:18:43
Okay.

332
00:18:43 --> 00:18:44
Good.

333
00:18:44 --> 00:18:48
So that's elimination and back
substitution,

334
00:18:48 --> 00:18:53
and I kept the right-hand side
along.

335
00:18:53 --> 00:19:00
Okay, now what do I -- that,
like, is first piece of the

336
00:19:00 --> 00:19:00
lecture.

337
00:19:00 --> 00:19:03.57
What's the second piece?

338
00:19:03.57 --> 00:19:06.8
Matrices are going to get in.

339
00:19:06.8 --> 00:19:11
So I wrote stuff with x,
y-s and z-s in there,

340
00:19:11 --> 00:19:17
then I really,
got the right shorthand,

341
00:19:17 --> 00:19:23
just writing the matrix
entries, and now I want to write

342
00:19:23 --> 00:19:28
the operations that I did in
matrices, right?

343
00:19:28 --> 00:19:34
I've carried the matrices
along, but I haven't said the

344
00:19:34 --> 00:19:41
operation those elimination
steps, I now want to express as

345
00:19:41 --> 00:19:43.67
matrices.

346
00:19:43.67 --> 00:19:44
Okay.

347
00:19:44 --> 00:19:46
Here they come.

348
00:19:46 --> 00:19:52
So now this is elimination
matrices.

349
00:19:52 --> 00:19:53
Okay.

350
00:19:53 --> 00:20:02
Let me take that first step,
which took me from 1 2 1 3 8 1

351
00:20:02 --> 00:20:03
0 4 1.

352
00:20:03 --> 00:20:14
I want to operate on that -- I
want to do elimination on that.

353
00:20:14 --> 00:20:14
Okay.

354
00:20:14 --> 00:20:20
Okay, now I'm remembering a
point I want to single out as

355
00:20:20 --> 00:20:23
especially important.

356
00:20:23 --> 00:20:26
Let me move the board up for
that.

357
00:20:26 --> 00:20:32
Because when we do matrix
operations, we've got to,

358
00:20:32 --> 00:20:37
like, be able to see the big
picture.

359
00:20:37 --> 00:20:37
Okay.

360
00:20:37 --> 00:20:43
Last time, I spoke about the
big picture of -- when I

361
00:20:43 --> 00:20:47
multiply a matrix by a
right-hand side.

362
00:20:47 --> 00:20:52
If I have some matrix there and
I multiply it by 3 4 5,

363
00:20:52 --> 00:20:57
let's say -- so here's a matrix
--

364
00:20:57 --> 00:21:01
what did I say -- well,
I guess I only said it on the

365
00:21:01 --> 00:21:06
videotape, but -- do you
remember how I look at that

366
00:21:06 --> 00:21:08
matrix multiplication?

367
00:21:08 --> 00:21:13
The result of multiplying a
matrix by some vector is a

368
00:21:13 --> 00:21:17
combination of the columns of
the matrix.

369
00:21:17 --> 00:21:19
It's 3 times the first column.

370
00:21:19 --> 00:21:25
It's 3 times column one plus 4
times column two plus 5 times

371
00:21:25 --> 00:21:27
column three.

372
00:21:27 --> 00:21:28
Okay.

373
00:21:28 --> 00:21:34
I'm going to come back to that
multiple times.

374
00:21:34 --> 00:21:43
What I wanted to do now was to
emphasize the parallel thing

375
00:21:43 --> 00:21:44
with rows.

376
00:21:44 --> 00:21:45
Why?

377
00:21:45 --> 00:21:54
Because all our operations here
for this two weeks of the course

378
00:21:54 --> 00:21:58
are row operations.

379
00:21:58 --> 00:22:04
So this isn't what I need for
row operations.

380
00:22:04 --> 00:22:08
Let me do a row operation.

381
00:22:08 --> 00:22:16
Suppose I have my matrix again
and suppose I multiply on the

382
00:22:16 --> 00:22:20
left by some -- let's say 1 2 7.

383
00:22:20 --> 00:22:27
Again, I'm just,
like, saying what the result

384
00:22:27 --> 00:22:28.78
is.

385
00:22:28.78 --> 00:22:35
And then we'll say how matrix
multiplication works and we'll

386
00:22:35 --> 00:22:37
see that it's true.

387
00:22:37 --> 00:22:37
Okay.

388
00:22:37 --> 00:22:44
But maybe already I'm making --
I'm sort of bringing up -- the

389
00:22:44 --> 00:22:50
central idea of linear algebra
is how these matrices work by

390
00:22:50 --> 00:22:54
rows as well as by columns.

391
00:22:54 --> 00:22:54
Okay.

392
00:22:54 --> 00:22:57
How does it work by rows?

393
00:22:57 --> 00:23:01
What -- so that's a row vector.

394
00:23:01 --> 00:23:06
I could say that's a one by
three matrix,

395
00:23:06 --> 00:23:12
a row vector multiplying a
three by three matrix.

396
00:23:12 --> 00:23:14.57
What's the output?

397
00:23:14.57 --> 00:23:20
What's the product of a row
times a matrix?

398
00:23:20 --> 00:23:23
And -- okay,
it's a row.

399
00:23:23 --> 00:23:26
A row -- a column -- I'm sorry.

400
00:23:26 --> 00:23:30
A matrix times a column is a
column.

401
00:23:30 --> 00:23:33
So matrix times a -- yeah.

402
00:23:33 --> 00:23:36
Matrix times a column is a
column.

403
00:23:36 --> 00:23:39
And we know what column it is.

404
00:23:39 --> 00:23:45
Over here, I'm doing a row
times a matrix.

405
00:23:45 --> 00:23:47
And what's the answer?

406
00:23:47 --> 00:23:54
It's one of that first row,
so it's 1 times -- 1 times row

407
00:23:54 --> 00:24:00
one, plus 2 times row two plus 7
times row three.

408
00:24:00 --> 00:24:04
When -- as we do matrix
multiplication,

409
00:24:04 --> 00:24:11
keep your eye on what it's
doing with whole vectors.

410
00:24:11 --> 00:24:17
And what it's doing -- what
it's doing in this case is it's

411
00:24:17 --> 00:24:19.38
combining the rows.

412
00:24:19.38 --> 00:24:24
And we have a combination,
a linear combination of the

413
00:24:24 --> 00:24:25
rows.

414
00:24:25 --> 00:24:27
Okay, I want to use that.

415
00:24:27 --> 00:24:33
Okay, so my question is what's
the matrix that does this first

416
00:24:33 --> 00:24:39
step, that takes -- subtracts 3
of equation one from equation

417
00:24:39 --> 00:24:40
two?

418
00:24:40 --> 00:24:44
That's what I want to do.

419
00:24:44 --> 00:24:52
So this is going to be a matrix
that's going to subtract 3 times

420
00:24:52 --> 00:24:59
row one from row two,
and leaves the other rows the

421
00:24:59 --> 00:24:59
same.

422
00:24:59 --> 00:25:07
Just in -- I mean,
the answer is going to be that.

423
00:25:07 --> 00:25:10
So whatever matrix this is --
and you're going to,

424
00:25:10 --> 00:25:15
like, tell me what matrix will
do it, it's the matrix that

425
00:25:15 --> 00:25:19
leaves the first row unchanged,
leaves the last row unchanged,

426
00:25:19 --> 00:25:23
but takes 3 of these away from
this so it puts a 0 there,

427
00:25:23 --> 00:25:25
a 2 there and a minus 2.

428
00:25:25 --> 00:25:26
Good.

429
00:25:26 --> 00:25:28.63
What matrix will do it?

430
00:25:28.63 --> 00:25:29
It's these.

431
00:25:29 --> 00:25:34.97
It should be a pretty simple
matrix, because we're doing a

432
00:25:34.97 --> 00:25:36
very simple step.

433
00:25:36 --> 00:25:40
We're just doing this step that
changes row two.

434
00:25:40 --> 00:25:44
So actually,
row one is not changing.

435
00:25:44 --> 00:25:48
So tell me how the matrix
should begin.

436
00:25:48 --> 00:25:54
One -- the first row of the
matrix will be 1 0 0,

437
00:25:54 --> 00:26:00
because that's just the right
thing that takes one of that row

438
00:26:00 --> 00:26:06
and none of the other rows,
and that's what we want.

439
00:26:06 --> 00:26:11
What's the last row of the
matrix?

440
00:26:11 --> 00:26:15
0 0 1, because that takes one
of the third row and none of the

441
00:26:15 --> 00:26:17
other rows, that's great.

442
00:26:17 --> 00:26:18
Okay.

443
00:26:18 --> 00:26:22
Now, suppose I didn't want to
do anything at all.

444
00:26:22 --> 00:26:26
Suppose my row -- well,
I guess maybe I had a case here

445
00:26:26 --> 00:26:31
when I already had a 0 and,
didn't have to do anything.

446
00:26:31 --> 00:26:36.94
What matrix does nothing,
like, just leaves you where you

447
00:26:36.94 --> 00:26:37
were?

448
00:26:37 --> 00:26:43
If I put in -- if I put in 0 1
0, that would be -- that would

449
00:26:43 --> 00:26:48
be -- that's the matrix --
what's the name of that matrix?

450
00:26:48 --> 00:26:52
The identity matrix,
right.

451
00:26:52 --> 00:26:54
So it does absolutely nothing.

452
00:26:54 --> 00:26:58
It just multiplies everything
and leaves it where it is.

453
00:26:58 --> 00:27:01
It's like a one,
like the number one,

454
00:27:01 --> 00:27:02.1
for matrices.

455
00:27:02.1 --> 00:27:06
But that's not what we want,
because we want to change this

456
00:27:06 --> 00:27:09
row to -- so what's the correct
--

457
00:27:09 --> 00:27:14
what should I put in here now
to do it right?

458
00:27:14 --> 00:27:17
I want to get -- what do I
want?

459
00:27:17 --> 00:27:23
What I -- I'm after -- I want 3
of row one to get subtracted

460
00:27:23 --> 00:27:23
off.

461
00:27:23 --> 00:27:29
So what's the right matrix,
finish that matrix for me.

462
00:27:29 --> 00:27:31
Negative 3 goes here?

463
00:27:31 --> 00:27:33
And what goes here?

464
00:27:33 --> 00:27:34
That 1.

465
00:27:34 --> 00:27:35
And what goes here?

466
00:27:35 --> 00:27:36
The 0.

467
00:27:36 --> 00:27:38
That's the good matrix.

468
00:27:38 --> 00:27:43
That's the matrix that takes
minus 3 of row one plus the row

469
00:27:43 --> 00:27:46
two and gives the new row 2.

470
00:27:46 --> 00:27:50
Should we just,
like, check some particular

471
00:27:50 --> 00:27:50
entry?

472
00:27:50 --> 00:27:55
How do I check a particular
entry of a matrix in matrix

473
00:27:55 --> 00:27:58
multiplication?

474
00:27:58 --> 00:28:05
Like, suppose I wanted to check
the entry here that's in row

475
00:28:05 --> 00:28:07
two, column three.

476
00:28:07 --> 00:28:14
So where does the entry in row
two, column three come from?

477
00:28:14 --> 00:28:21
I would look at row two of this
guy and column three of this one

478
00:28:21 --> 00:28:24
to get that number.

479
00:28:24 --> 00:28:29
That number comes from the
second row and the third column

480
00:28:29 --> 00:28:35
and I just take this dot product
minus 3 -- I'm multiplying --

481
00:28:35 --> 00:28:38
minus 3 plus 1 and 0 gives the
minus 2.

482
00:28:38 --> 00:28:39
Yeah.

483
00:28:39 --> 00:28:39
It works.

484
00:28:39 --> 00:28:44
So we got various ways to
multiply matrices now.

485
00:28:44 --> 00:28:47
We're sort of,
like -- informally.

486
00:28:47 --> 00:28:50
We've got by columns,
we've got -- well,

487
00:28:50 --> 00:28:55
we will have by columns,
by rows, by each entry at a

488
00:28:55 --> 00:28:55
time.

489
00:28:55 --> 00:28:59
But it's good to see that
matrix multiplication when one

490
00:28:59 --> 00:29:02
of the matrices is so simple.

491
00:29:02 --> 00:29:06
So this guy is our elementary
matrix.

492
00:29:06 --> 00:29:10
Let's call it E for elementary
or elimination.

493
00:29:10 --> 00:29:16.61
And let me put the indexes 2 1,
because it's the matrix that we

494
00:29:16.61 --> 00:29:19.59
needed to fix the 2 1 position.

495
00:29:19.59 --> 00:29:25
It's the matrix that we needed
to get this 2 1 position to be

496
00:29:25 --> 0.


497
0. --> 00:29:25


498
00:29:25 --> 00:29:26.03
Okay.

499
00:29:26.03 --> 00:29:28
Good enough.

500
00:29:28 --> 00:29:30
So what do I do next?

501
00:29:30 --> 00:29:33
I need another matrix,
right?

502
00:29:33 --> 00:29:37
I need to -- there's another
step here.

503
00:29:37 --> 00:29:44
And I want to express the whole
elimination process in matrix

504
00:29:44 --> 00:29:45
language.

505
00:29:45 --> 00:29:49
So tell me what -- so next
step, step two,

506
00:29:49 --> 00:29:52
which was what?

507
00:29:52 --> 00:29:59
Subtract -- what was -- what
was the actual step that we did?

508
00:29:59 --> 00:30:03
I think I subtracted -- do you
remember?

509
00:30:03 --> 00:30:10
I had a 2 in the pivot and a 4
below it, so I subtracted two

510
00:30:10 --> 00:30:14.52
times -- times row two from row
three.

511
00:30:14.52 --> 00:30:16.19
From row three.

512
00:30:16.19 --> 00:30:21
Tell me the matrix that will do
that.

513
00:30:21 --> 00:30:23.49
And tell me its name.

514
00:30:23.49 --> 00:30:28
Okay, it's going to be E,
for elementary or elimination

515
00:30:28 --> 00:30:34
matrix and what's the index
number that I used to tell me

516
00:30:34 --> 00:30:36
what E -- 3, 2,
right?

517
00:30:36 --> 00:30:40
Because it's fixing this 3 2
position.

518
00:30:40 --> 00:30:43.69
And what's the matrix,
now?

519
00:30:43.69 --> 00:30:48
Okay, you remember -- so E 3 2
is supposed to multiply my guy

520
00:30:48 --> 00:30:52
that I have and it's supposed to
produce the right result,

521
00:30:52 --> 00:30:57
which was -- it leaves -- it's
supposed to leave the first row,

522
00:30:57 --> 00:31:02
it's supposed to leave the
second row and it's supposed to

523
00:31:02 --> 00:31:05
straighten out that third row to
this.

524
00:31:05 --> 00:31:09
And what's the matrix that does
that?

525
00:31:09 --> 00:31:11
1 0 0, right?

526
00:31:11 --> 00:31:17
Because we don't change the
first row and the next row we

527
00:31:17 --> 00:31:23
don't change either,
and the last row is the one we

528
00:31:23 --> 00:31:24
do change.

529
00:31:24 --> 00:31:26
And what do I do?

530
00:31:26 --> 00:31:33
Let's see, I subtract two times
-- so what's this row?

531
00:31:33 --> 00:31:37
What's this here?
0, right, because the first

532
00:31:37 --> 00:31:39
row's not involved.

533
00:31:39 --> 00:31:42
It's just in the 3 2 position,
isn't it?

534
00:31:42 --> 00:31:47
This the key number is this
minus the multiplier that goes

535
00:31:47 --> 00:31:51
-- sitting there in that 3 2
position.

536
00:31:51 --> 00:31:58
Is it a minus 2 to subtract 2
and then this is a 1 so that --

537
00:31:58 --> 00:32:05
the overall effect is to take
minus 2 of this row plus 1 of

538
00:32:05 --> 00:32:05
that.

539
00:32:05 --> 00:32:06
Okay.

540
00:32:06 --> 00:32:11
So, I've now given you the
pieces, the elimination

541
00:32:11 --> 00:32:19
matrices, the elementary
matrices that take each step.

542
00:32:19 --> 00:32:20
So now what?

543
00:32:20 --> 00:32:25.91
Now the next point in the
lecture is to put those steps

544
00:32:25.91 --> 00:32:31
together into a matrix that does
it all and see how it all

545
00:32:31 --> 00:32:32
happens.

546
00:32:32 --> 00:32:39
So now I'm going to express the
whole -- everything we did today

547
00:32:39 --> 00:32:45
so far on A was to start with A,
we multiplied it by E 2 1,

548
00:32:45 --> 00:32:52
that was the first step --
and then we multiplied that

549
00:32:52 --> 00:33:00
result by E 3 2 and that led us
to this thing and what was that

550
00:33:00 --> 00:33:01
matrix?

551
00:33:01 --> 00:33:01.8
U.

552
00:33:01.8 --> 00:33:08.57
You see why I like matrix
notation, because there in,

553
00:33:08.57 --> 00:33:16
like, little space -- a few
bits when its compressed on the

554
00:33:16 --> 00:33:23
web -- is everything -- is this
whole lecture.

555
00:33:23 --> 00:33:23
Okay.

556
00:33:23 --> 00:33:28
Now there -- there are
important facts about matrix

557
00:33:28 --> 00:33:30
multiplication.

558
00:33:30 --> 00:33:34
And we're close to maybe the
most important.

559
00:33:34 --> 00:33:36
And that is this.

560
00:33:36 --> 00:33:39
Suppose I ask you this
question.

561
00:33:39 --> 00:33:45
Suppose I start with a matrix A
and I want to end with a matrix

562
00:33:45 --> 00:33:52
U and I want to say what matrix
does the whole job?

563
00:33:52 --> 00:33:59.12
What matrix takes me from A to
U, using the letters I've got?

564
00:33:59.12 --> 00:34:01
And the answer is simple.

565
00:34:01 --> 00:34:07
I'm not asking this as -- but
it's highly important.

566
00:34:07 --> 00:34:14
How would I create the matrix
that does the whole job at once,

567
00:34:14 --> 00:34:20
that does all of elimination in
one shot?

568
00:34:20 --> 00:34:24
It would be -- I would just put
these together,

569
00:34:24 --> 00:34:25
right?

570
00:34:25 --> 00:34:28
In other words,
this is the thing I'm

571
00:34:28 --> 00:34:30
struggling to say.

572
00:34:30 --> 00:34:32
I can move those parentheses.

573
00:34:32 --> 00:34:38
If I keep the matrices in order
-- I can't mess around with the

574
00:34:38 --> 00:34:44
order of the matrices,
but I can change the order that

575
00:34:44 --> 00:34:46
I do the multiplications.

576
00:34:46 --> 00:34:51
I can multiply these two first
-- in other words,

577
00:34:51 --> 00:34:55.64
you see what those parentheses
are doing?

578
00:34:55.64 --> 00:35:01
It's saying -- multiply the Es
first and that gives you the

579
00:35:01 --> 00:35:05
matrix that does everything at
once.

580
00:35:05 --> 00:35:06
Okay.

581
00:35:06 --> 00:35:09
So this fact,
that this is automatically the

582
00:35:09 --> 00:35:14
same as this -- for every matrix
multiplication,

583
00:35:14 --> 00:35:19
which I'm conscious of still
not telling you in every detail,

584
00:35:19 --> 00:35:24.42
but, like, you're seeing how it
works -- and this is highly

585
00:35:24.42 --> 00:35:28
important --
and maybe tell me the long word

586
00:35:28 --> 00:35:33
that describes this law for
matrices, that you can move the

587
00:35:33 --> 00:35:34
parentheses?

588
00:35:34 --> 00:35:37
It's called the associative
law.

589
00:35:37 --> 00:35:39
I think you can now forget
that.

590
00:35:39 --> 00:35:41
But don't forget the law.

591
00:35:41 --> 00:35:46
I mean, like,
forget the word associative.

592
00:35:46 --> 00:35:47
I don't know.

593
00:35:47 --> 00:35:50
But don't forget the law.

594
00:35:50 --> 00:35:56
Because actually,
we'll see so many steps in

595
00:35:56 --> 00:35:59
linear algebra,
so many proofs,

596
00:35:59 --> 00:36:07
even, of main fact come from
just moving the parentheses.

597
00:36:07 --> 00:36:12
And it's not that easy to prove
that this is correct,

598
00:36:12 --> 00:36:16
you have to go into the gory
details of matrix

599
00:36:16 --> 00:36:20
multiplication,
do it both ways and see that

600
00:36:20 --> 00:36:22
you come out the same.

601
00:36:22 --> 00:36:25
Maybe I'll leave the author to
do that.

602
00:36:25 --> 00:36:26
Okay.

603
00:36:26 --> 00:36:28
So there we go.

604
00:36:28 --> 00:36:34
So there's a single matrix,
I could call it E -- while

605
00:36:34 --> 00:36:40
we're talking about these
matrices, tell me one other --

606
00:36:40 --> 00:36:45
there's another type of
elementary matrix,

607
00:36:45 --> 00:36:50
and we already said why we
might need it.

608
00:36:50 --> 00:36:53
We didn't need it in this case.

609
00:36:53 --> 00:36:56
But it's the matrix that
exchanges two rows.

610
00:36:56 --> 00:36:59
It's called a permutation
matrix.

611
00:36:59 --> 00:37:02.55
Can you just,
like, tell me what that would

612
00:37:02.55 --> 00:37:02
be?

613
00:37:02 --> 00:37:06
So I'm just -- like,
this is a slight digression and

614
00:37:06 --> 00:37:11
we'll --
yes, so let me get some -- let

615
00:37:11 --> 00:37:17
me figure out where I'm going to
put a permutation matrix.

616
00:37:17 --> 00:37:21
You'll see I'm always squeezing
stuff in.

617
00:37:21 --> 00:37:23.44
So permutation.

618
00:37:23.44 --> 00:37:29
Or, in fact this one you'll,
like, exchange rows -- shall I

619
00:37:29 --> 00:37:35
exchange rows one and two,
just to make life easy?

620
00:37:35 --> 00:37:42
So if I had my matrix -- no,
let -- let me just do two by

621
00:37:42 --> 00:37:44
two.
|a b; c d|.

622
00:37:44 --> 00:37:50.04
Suppose I want to find the
matrix that exchanges those

623
00:37:50.04 --> 00:37:50.61
rows.

624
00:37:50.61 --> 00:37:51
What is it?

625
00:37:51 --> 00:37:58
So the matrix that exchanges
those rows -- the row I want is

626
00:37:58 --> 00:38:02
c d and it's there.

627
00:38:02 --> 00:38:04
So I better take one of it.

628
00:38:04 --> 00:38:09
And the row I want here is up
top, so I'll take one of that.

629
00:38:09 --> 00:38:12.43
So actually,
I'm just -- the easy way --

630
00:38:12.43 --> 00:38:16
this is my matrix that I'll call
P, for permutation.

631
00:38:16 --> 00:38:21
It's the matrix -- actually,
the easy way to find it is just

632
00:38:21 --> 00:38:25
do the thing to the identity
matrix.

633
00:38:25 --> 00:38:29
Exchange the rows of the
identity matrix and then that's

634
00:38:29 --> 00:38:33
the matrix that will do row
exchanges for you.

635
00:38:33 --> 00:38:36.99
Suppose I wanted to exchange
columns instead.

636
00:38:36.99 --> 00:38:40
Columns have hardly got into
today's lecture,

637
00:38:40 --> 00:38:44.61
but they certainly are going to
be around.

638
00:38:44.61 --> 00:38:49
How could I -- if I started
with this matrix |a b;

639
00:38:49 --> 00:38:55
c d| then I wouldn't -- I'm not
even going to write this down,

640
00:38:55 --> 00:39:00
I'm just going to ask you,
because in elimination,

641
00:39:00 --> 00:39:03
we're doing rows.

642
00:39:03 --> 00:39:07
But suppose we wanted to
exchange the columns of a

643
00:39:07 --> 00:39:08
matrix.

644
00:39:08 --> 00:39:10
How would I do that?

645
00:39:10 --> 00:39:14
What matrix multiplication
would do that job?

646
00:39:14 --> 00:39:16.23
Actually, why not?

647
00:39:16.23 --> 00:39:18
I'll write it down.

648
00:39:18 --> 00:39:23
So this is -- I'll write it
under here and then hide it

649
00:39:23 --> 00:39:24.71
again.

650
00:39:24.71 --> 00:39:25
Okay.

651
00:39:25 --> 00:39:32
Suppose I had my matrix |a b;
c d| and I want to get to a c

652
00:39:32 --> 00:39:35
over here and b d here.

653
00:39:35 --> 00:39:39
What matrix does that job?

654
00:39:39 --> 00:39:46
Can I multiply -- can I cook up
some matrix that produces that

655
00:39:46 --> 00:39:47
answer?

656
00:39:47 --> 00:39:55
You can see from where I put my
hand I was really asking can I

657
00:39:55 --> 00:40:04
put a matrix here on the left
that will exchange columns?

658
00:40:04 --> 00:40:06
And the answer is no.

659
00:40:06 --> 00:40:12
I'm just bringing out again
this point that when I multiply

660
00:40:12 --> 00:40:16
on the left, I'm doing row
operations.

661
00:40:16 --> 00:40:23
So if I want to do a column
operation, where do I put that

662
00:40:23 --> 00:40:26
permutation matrix?

663
00:40:26 --> 00:40:27
On the right.

664
00:40:27 --> 00:40:30
If I put it here,
where I just barely left room

665
00:40:30 --> 00:40:35
for it -- so I'll exchange the
two columns of the identity.

666
00:40:35 --> 00:40:39
Then it comes out right,
because now I'm multiplying a

667
00:40:39 --> 00:40:41
column at a time.

668
00:40:41 --> 00:40:45
This is the first column and
says take one --

669
00:40:45 --> 00:40:50
take none of that column,
one of this one and then you

670
00:40:50 --> 00:40:50
got it.

671
00:40:50 --> 00:40:55
Over here, take one of this
one, none of this one and you've

672
00:40:55 --> 00:40:56
got a c.

673
00:40:56 --> 00:40:58
So, in short,
to do column operations,

674
00:40:58 --> 00:41:02
the matrix multiplies on the
right.

675
00:41:02 --> 00:41:08
To do row operations,
it multiplies on the left.

676
00:41:08 --> 00:41:14
Okay, okay, and it's row
operations that we're really

677
00:41:14 --> 00:41:14
doing.

678
00:41:14 --> 00:41:15
Okay.

679
00:41:15 --> 00:41:19.99
And of course,
I mentioned in passing,

680
00:41:19.99 --> 00:41:26
but I better say it very
clearly that you can't exchange

681
00:41:26 --> 00:41:30
the orders of matrices.

682
00:41:30 --> 00:41:35
And that's just the point I was
making again here.

683
00:41:35 --> 00:41:39.75
A times B is not the same as B
times A.

684
00:41:39.75 --> 00:41:46
You have to keep these matrices
in their Gauss given order here,

685
00:41:46 --> 00:41:47
right?

686
00:41:47 --> 00:41:51
But you can move the
parentheses, so that,

687
00:41:51 --> 00:41:56
in other words,
the commutative law,

688
00:41:56 --> 00:42:03
which would allow you to take
it in the other order is false.

689
00:42:03 --> 00:42:08
So we have to keep it in that
order.

690
00:42:08 --> 00:42:08
Okay.

691
00:42:08 --> 00:42:10
So what next?

692
00:42:10 --> 00:42:14
I could do this multiplication.

693
00:42:14 --> 00:42:15
I could do E 32.

694
00:42:15 --> 00:42:22
So let me come back to see what
that was.

695
00:42:22 --> 00:42:24
Here was E 2 1.

696
00:42:24 --> 00:42:26
And here is E 3 2.

697
00:42:26 --> 00:42:35
And if I multiply those two
matrices together -- E 3 2 and

698
00:42:35 --> 00:42:43
then E 2 1, I'll get a single
matrix that does elimination.

699
00:42:43 --> 00:42:52
I don't want to do it that --
if I do that multiplication --

700
00:42:52 --> 00:42:57
there -- there's a better way
to do this.

701
00:42:57 --> 00:43:03
And so in this last few minutes
of today's lecture,

702
00:43:03 --> 00:43:06
can I anticipate that better
way?

703
00:43:06 --> 00:43:13
The better way is to think not
how do I get from A to U,

704
00:43:13 --> 00:43:16
but how do I get from U back to
A?

705
00:43:16 --> 00:43:22
So reversing steps is going to
come in.

706
00:43:22 --> 00:43:26
Inverse -- I'll use the word
inverse here.

707
00:43:26 --> 00:43:26.96
Okay.

708
00:43:26.96 --> 00:43:32
So let me make the first step
at what's the inverse matrix?

709
00:43:32 --> 00:43:37.55
All the matrices you've seen on
this board have inverses.

710
00:43:37.55 --> 00:43:40
I didn't write any bad matrices
down.

711
00:43:40 --> 00:43:45
We spoke about possible
failure, and for a moment,

712
00:43:45 --> 00:43:49
we put in a matrix that would
fail.

713
00:43:49 --> 00:43:53
But right now,
all these matrices are good,

714
00:43:53 --> 00:43:55
they're all invertible.

715
00:43:55 --> 00:44:00
And let's take the inverse --
well, let me say first what does

716
00:44:00 --> 00:44:03
the inverse mean and find it?

717
00:44:03 --> 00:44:03
Okay.

718
00:44:03 --> 00:44:07
So we're getting a little leg
up on inverses.

719
00:44:07 --> 00:44:12
Okay, so this is the final
moments of today.

720
00:44:12 --> 00:44:15
Sorry, he's still there.

721
00:44:15 --> 00:44:16
Okay.

722
00:44:16 --> 00:44:18
Inverses.

723
00:44:18 --> 00:44:27
Okay, and I'm just going to
take one example and then we're

724
00:44:27 --> 00:44:28
done.

725
00:44:28 --> 00:44:33
The example I'll take will be
that E.

726
00:44:33 --> 00:44:39
So my matrix is 1 0 0 minus 3 1
0 0 0 1.

727
00:44:39 --> 00:44:49
And I want to find the matrix
that undoes that step.

728
00:44:49 --> 00:44:52
So what was that step?

729
00:44:52 --> 00:44:58
The step was subtract 3 times
row one from row two.

730
00:44:58 --> 00:45:02
So what matrix will get me
back?

731
00:45:02 --> 00:45:09.73
What matrix will bring back --
you know, if I started with a 2

732
00:45:09.73 --> 00:45:16
12 2 and I changed it to a 2 6 2
because of this guy,

733
00:45:16 --> 2.
I want to get back to the 2 12

734
2. --> 00:45:21


735
00:45:21 --> 00:45:27
I want to find the matrix which
-- which undoes elimination,

736
00:45:27 --> 00:45:32
the matrix which multiplies
this to give the identity.

737
00:45:32 --> 00:45:37
And you can tell me what I
should do in words first,

738
00:45:37 --> 00:45:43
and then we'll write down the
matrix that does it.

739
00:45:43 --> 00:45:49
If this step subtracted 3 times
row 1 from row 2,

740
00:45:49 --> 00:45:52
what's the inverse step?

741
00:45:52 --> 00:45:56
I add 3 times row one to row
two, right?

742
00:45:56 --> 00:45:58
I add it back.

743
00:45:58 --> 00:46:03
The -- what I subtracted away,
I add back.

744
00:46:03 --> 00:46:08.94
So the inverse matrix in this
case is --

745
00:46:08.94 --> 00:46:13
I now want to add 3 times row
one to row two,

746
00:46:13 --> 00:46:20.17
so I won't change row one,
I won't change row three and

747
00:46:20.17 --> 00:46:24
I'll add 3 times row one to row
two.

748
00:46:24 --> 00:46:28
That's a case where the inverse
is clear.

749
00:46:28 --> 00:46:35
It's clear in words what to do,
because what this did was

750
00:46:35 --> 00:46:38
simple to express.

751
00:46:38 --> 00:46:42
It just changed row two by
subtracting 3 of row one.

752
00:46:42 --> 00:46:44
So to invert it,
I go that way.

753
00:46:44 --> 00:46:47
And if you -- if we do that
calculation, 3 times this row

754
00:46:47 --> 00:46:51
plus 1 times this row,
comes out the right row of the

755
00:46:51 --> 00:46:52
identity.

756
00:46:52 --> 00:46:56
Okay, so inverses are an -- so
if this matrix was E and this

757
00:46:56 --> 00:46:59.98
matrix is I for identity,
then what's the notation for

758
00:46:59.98 --> 00:47:01
this guy?

759
00:47:01 --> 00:47:02
E to the minus one.

760
00:47:02 --> 00:47:03
E inverse.

761
00:47:03 --> 00:47:03
Okay.

762
00:47:03 --> 00:47:05
Let's stop there for today.

763
00:47:05 --> 00:47:09
That's a little jump on what's
coming on Monday.

764
00:47:09 --> 00:47:12
So, see you Monday.
