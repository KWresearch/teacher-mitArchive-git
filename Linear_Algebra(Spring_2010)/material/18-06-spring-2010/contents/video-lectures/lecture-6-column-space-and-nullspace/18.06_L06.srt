1
00:00:06 --> 00:00:07
Okay.

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:13.85
This is lecture six in linear
algebra, and we're at the start

3
00:00:13.85 --> 00:00:18
of this new chapter,
chapter three in the text,

4
00:00:18 --> 00:00:24
which is really getting to the
center of linear algebra.

5
00:00:24 --> 00:00:30
And I had time to make a first
start on it at the end of

6
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
lecture five.

7
00:00:32 --> 00:00:37
But now is lecture six is
officially the lecture on vector

8
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39.62
spaces and subspaces.

9
00:00:39.62 --> 00:00:44
And then especially -- there
are two subspaces that we're

10
00:00:44 --> 00:00:46.54
specially interested in.

11
00:00:46.54 --> 00:00:51.47
One is the column space of a
matrix, the other is the null

12
00:00:51.47 --> 00:00:53.2
space of the matrix.

13
00:00:53.2 --> 00:00:57
So, I got to tell you what
those are.

14
00:00:57 --> 00:00:57
Okay.

15
00:00:57 --> 00:01:01
So, first to remember from
lecture five,

16
00:01:01 --> 00:01:03.77
what is a vector space?

17
00:01:03.77 --> 00:01:09
It's a bunch of vectors that --
where I'm allowed -- where I can

18
00:01:09 --> 00:01:15
add -- I can add any two vectors
in the space and the answer

19
00:01:15 --> 00:01:17.46
stays in the space.

20
00:01:17.46 --> 00:01:23
Or I can multiply any vector in
the space by any constant and

21
00:01:23 --> 00:01:27
the result stays in the space.

22
00:01:27 --> 00:01:31
So that's -- in fact if I
combine those two into one,

23
00:01:31 --> 00:01:35
you can see that -- if I can
add and I can multiply by

24
00:01:35 --> 00:01:40
numbers, that really means that
I can take linear combinations.

25
00:01:40 --> 00:01:45
So the quick way to say it is
that all linear combinations,

26
00:01:45 --> 00:01:49
C --
any multiple of V plus any

27
00:01:49 --> 00:01:52
multiple of W stay in the space.

28
00:01:52 --> 00:01:58
So, can I give you examples
that are vector spaces and also

29
00:01:58 --> 00:02:03
some examples that are not,
to make that point clear?

30
00:02:03 --> 00:02:06
So, suppose I'm in three
dimensions.

31
00:02:06 --> 00:02:11
Then one way to get us one
space is the whole three

32
00:02:11 --> 00:02:14
dimensional space.

33
00:02:14 --> 00:02:18
So the whole space R^3,
three dimensional space,

34
00:02:18 --> 00:02:23
would be a vector space,
because if I have a couple of

35
00:02:23 --> 00:02:29
vectors I can add them and I'm
certainly okay and they follow

36
00:02:29 --> 00:02:30
all the rules.

37
00:02:30 --> 00:02:31
So R^3 is easy.

38
00:02:31 --> 00:02:36
Now I'm interested also in
subspaces.

39
00:02:36 --> 00:02:39
So there's this key word,
subspaces.

40
00:02:39 --> 00:02:45
That's a space -- that's some
vectors inside the given space,

41
00:02:45 --> 00:02:51.66
inside R three that still make
up a vector space of their own.

42
00:02:51.66 --> 00:02:56
It's a vector space inside a
vector space.

43
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
And the simplest example was a
plane.

44
00:02:59 --> 00:03:04
So, like, can I just sketch it
-- there is a plane.

45
00:03:04 --> 00:03:08
It's got to go through the
origin, and of course it goes

46
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
infinitely far.

47
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
That's of that's a subspace
now.

48
00:03:12 --> 00:03:18.12
Do you see that if I have two
vectors on the plane and I add

49
00:03:18.12 --> 00:03:22
them, the result stays in the
plane.

50
00:03:22 --> 00:03:28
If I take a vector in the plane
and I multiply by minus two,

51
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
I'm still in the plane.

52
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
So that plane is a subspace.

53
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
So let me just make that point.

54
00:03:37 --> 00:03:43
Plane through zero,
through that zero zero zero is

55
00:03:43 --> 00:03:44
a subspace.

56
00:03:44 --> 00:03:44
Okay.

57
00:03:44 --> 00:03:50
And also, another subspace
would be a line.

58
00:03:50 --> 00:03:55
A line through zero zero zero
-- yeah, the line has to go

59
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
through the origin.

60
00:03:57 --> 00:04:01
All subspaces have got to
contain the origin,

61
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
contain zero -- the zero
vector.

62
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
So this line is a subspace.

63
00:04:07 --> 00:04:11
Really, if I want to say it
really correctly,

64
00:04:11 --> 00:04:15
I should say a subspace of R^3.

65
00:04:15 --> 00:04:21
That of R^3 was,
like, understood there.

66
00:04:21 --> 00:04:26
Now -- so let me call this
plane P.

67
00:04:26 --> 00:04:30
And let me call this line L.

68
00:04:30 --> 00:04:37
And let me ask you about other
sets of vectors.

69
00:04:37 --> 00:04:44
Suppose I took --
yeah -- so here's a first

70
00:04:44 --> 00:04:45
question.

71
00:04:45 --> 00:04:49
Suppose I take two subspaces,
like P and L.

72
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
And I just put them together,
take their union,

73
00:04:53 --> 00:04:59
take all the vectors -- so now
you've got P and L in mind,

74
00:04:59 --> 00:05:00
here.

75
00:05:00 --> 00:05:03
So I have two subspaces.

76
00:05:03 --> 00:05:09
I have two subspaces and,
for example,

77
00:05:09 --> 00:05:13
P -- a plane and L a line.

78
00:05:13 --> 00:05:14
Okay.

79
00:05:14 --> 00:05:21
Now I want to ask you about the
union of those.

80
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
So P union L.

81
00:05:23 --> 00:05:29
This is all vectors in P or L
or both.

82
00:05:29 --> 00:05:32
Is that a subspace?

83
00:05:32 --> 00:05:37.81
Is this a subspace?

84
00:05:37.81 --> 00:05:41
This is or is not a subspace?

85
00:05:41 --> 00:05:47
Because we're -- I just want to
be sure that I've got the

86
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
central idea.

87
00:05:49 --> 00:05:56
Suppose I take the vectors in
the plane and also the vectors

88
00:05:56 --> 00:06:00
on that line,
put them together,

89
00:06:00 --> 00:06:06
so I've got a bunch of vectors,
is it a subspace?

90
00:06:06 --> 00:06:10
Can you give me,
like, so the camera can hear it

91
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
or maybe the tape.

92
00:06:12 --> 00:06:14
Can you say yes or no?

93
00:06:14 --> 00:06:19
Do I have a subspace if I put
-- if I take all the vectors on

94
00:06:19 --> 00:06:24
the plane plus all -- and all
the ones on the line and just

95
00:06:24 --> 00:06:29.05
join them together --
but I'm not taking this guy

96
00:06:29.05 --> 00:06:32
that's -- actually,
I'm not taking most of them,

97
00:06:32 --> 00:06:36
because most vectors are not on
the line or the plane,

98
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
they're off somewhere else.

99
00:06:38 --> 00:06:39.65
Do I have a subspace?

100
00:06:39.65 --> 00:06:40
STUDENTS: No.

101
00:06:40 --> 00:06:41
STRANG: Right.

102
00:06:41 --> 00:06:42
Thank you.

103
00:06:42 --> 00:06:42
No.

104
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
Because -- why not?

105
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
Because I can't add.

106
00:06:46 --> 00:06:51
Because if I that requirement
isn't satisfied.

107
00:06:51 --> 00:06:57
If I take one vector like this
guy and another vector that

108
00:06:57 --> 00:07:03
happens to come from L and add,
I'm off somewhere else.

109
00:07:03 --> 00:07:07
You see that I've gone outside
the union if I just add

110
00:07:07 --> 00:07:11
something from P and something
from L, then normally what'll

111
00:07:11 --> 00:07:16
happen is I'm outside the union
-- and I don't have a subspace.

112
00:07:16 --> 00:07:18
So the correct answer is -- is
not.

113
00:07:18 --> 00:07:19
Okay.

114
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
Now let me ask you about -- the
other thing we do is take the

115
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25.24
intersection.

116
00:07:25.24 --> 00:07:28
So what does intersection mean?

117
00:07:28 --> 00:07:34
Intersection means all vectors
that are in both P and L.

118
00:07:34 --> 00:07:36
Is this a subspace.

119
00:07:36 --> 00:07:42
Yeah, so I guess I want to go
back up to the same question.

120
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
This is or is not a subspace?

121
00:07:45 --> 00:07:51
And you can answer me -- answer
the question first for this

122
00:07:51 --> 00:07:56
particular example,
this picture I drew.

123
00:07:56 --> 00:07:59
What is P intersect L for this
case?

124
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
STUDENT: It's only zero.

125
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
STRANG: It's only zero.

126
00:08:04 --> 00:08:09
At least, sort of this was the
artist's idea as he drew it

127
00:08:09 --> 00:08:13
that, that that line L was not
in the plane and,

128
00:08:13 --> 00:08:18
went off somewhere else --
and then the only point that

129
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
was in common was the zero
vector.

130
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
Is the zero vector by itself a
subspace?

131
00:08:23 --> 00:08:24
STUDENT: Yes.

132
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26.43
STRANG: Yes,
absolutely.

133
00:08:26.43 --> 00:08:29.54
And what about,
if I don't have this plane and

134
00:08:29.54 --> 00:08:33
this line but any subspace and
any other subspace?

135
00:08:33 --> 00:08:40
So now -- can I ask that
question for any two subspaces?

136
00:08:40 --> 00:08:44.54
So maybe I'll write it up here.

137
00:08:44.54 --> 00:08:47
If I'm strong enough.

138
00:08:47 --> 00:08:47.8
Okay.

139
00:08:47.8 --> 00:08:52
So this is the general
question.

140
00:08:52 --> 00:08:56.1
I have subspaces,
say S and T.

141
00:08:56.1 --> 00:09:03
And I want to ask you about
their intersection S intersect T

142
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07.07
and I want -- it is a subspace.

143
00:09:07.07 --> 00:09:08
Do you see why?

144
00:09:08 --> 00:09:15
Do you see why if I take the
vectors that are in both one-

145
00:09:15 --> 00:09:22
th- that are in both of the
subspaces -- so that's like a

146
00:09:22 --> 00:09:29
smaller set of vectors,
probably, because it's --

147
00:09:29 --> 00:09:32
we've added requirements.

148
00:09:32 --> 00:09:34.46
It has to be in S and in T.

149
00:09:34.46 --> 00:09:37
How do I know that's a
subspace?

150
00:09:37 --> 00:09:42
Can we just think through that
abstract stuff and then I get to

151
00:09:42 --> 00:09:43
the examples.

152
00:09:43 --> 00:09:44
Okay.

153
00:09:44 --> 00:09:44
So why?

154
00:09:44 --> 00:09:48
Suppose I take a couple of
vectors that are in the

155
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
intersection.

156
00:09:50 --> 00:09:55
Why is the sum also in the
intersection?

157
00:09:55 --> 00:09:59
Okay, so let me give a name to
these vectors,

158
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
say V and W.

159
00:10:01 --> 00:10:04
They're in the intersection.

160
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
So that means they're both in
S.

161
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
Also means they're both in T.

162
00:10:10 --> 00:10:14
So what can I say about V plus
W?

163
00:10:14 --> 00:10:15
Is it in S?

164
00:10:15 --> 00:10:15
Yes.

165
00:10:15 --> 00:10:18
Right?

166
00:10:18 --> 00:10:22
If I take two vectors,
V and W that are both in S,

167
00:10:22 --> 00:10:25
then the sum is in S,
because S was a subspace.

168
00:10:25 --> 00:10:30
And if they're both in T and I
add them, then the result is

169
00:10:30 --> 00:10:33
also in T, because T was a
subspace.

170
00:10:33 --> 00:10:37
So the result V plus W is in
the intersection.

171
00:10:37 --> 00:10:42
It's in both and requirement
one is satisfied.

172
00:10:42 --> 00:10:43
Requirement two's the same.

173
00:10:43 --> 00:10:47
If I take a vector that's in
both, I multiply by seven.

174
00:10:47 --> 00:10:52
Seven times that vector is in
S, because the vector was in S.

175
00:10:52 --> 00:10:56
Seven times that vector's in T
because the original one was in

176
00:10:56 --> 00:10:56
T.

177
00:10:56 --> 00:11:00
So seven times that vector is
in the intersection.

178
00:11:00 --> 00:11:05
In other words,
when you take the intersection

179
00:11:05 --> 00:11:09
of two subspaces,
you get probably a smaller

180
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
subspace, but it is a subspace.

181
00:11:12 --> 00:11:13
Okay.

182
00:11:13 --> 00:11:18
So that's like sort of just
emphasizing what these two

183
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
requirements mean.

184
00:11:20 --> 00:11:23
Again --
Let me circle those,

185
00:11:23 --> 00:11:26
because those are so important.

186
00:11:26 --> 00:11:30.5
The sum and the scale of
multiplication which combines

187
00:11:30.5 --> 00:11:32
into linear combinations.

188
00:11:32 --> 00:11:36
That's what you have to do
inside the subspace.

189
00:11:36 --> 00:11:36
Okay.

190
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
On to the column space.

191
00:11:38 --> 00:11:38
Okay.

192
00:11:38 --> 00:11:44
So my lecture last time started
that and I want to continue it.

193
00:11:44 --> 00:11:45
Okay.

194
00:11:45 --> 00:11:50
Column space of a matrix.

195
00:11:50 --> 00:11:51
Of A.

196
00:11:51 --> 00:11:52
Okay.

197
00:11:52 --> 00:11:56
Can I take an example?

198
00:11:56 --> 00:12:01
Say one two three four.

199
00:12:01 --> 00:12:04
One one one one.

200
00:12:04 --> 00:12:09
Two three four five.

201
00:12:09 --> 00:12:10
Okay.

202
00:12:10 --> 00:12:13
That's my matrix A.

203
00:12:13 --> 00:12:23
So, it's got columns,
three columns.

204
00:12:23 --> 00:12:28.35
Those columns are vectors,
so the column space of this A,

205
00:12:28.35 --> 00:12:32
of this A -- let's stay with
this example for a while.

206
00:12:32 --> 00:12:38
The column space of this matrix
is a subspace of R -- R what?

207
00:12:38 --> 00:12:43
So what space are we in if I'm
looking at the columns of this

208
00:12:43 --> 00:12:44
matrix?

209
00:12:44 --> 00:12:45.82
R^4 , right?

210
00:12:45.82 --> 00:12:50.54
These are vectors in R^4,
they're four dimensional

211
00:12:50.54 --> 00:12:51
vectors.

212
00:12:51 --> 00:12:56
So it's this column space of A
is a subspace of R^4 here,

213
00:12:56 --> 00:13:01
because A was four by -- A is a
four by three matrix.

214
00:13:01 --> 00:13:07
This tells me how many rows
there are, how many components

215
00:13:07 --> 00:13:11
in a column, and so we're in
R^4.

216
00:13:11 --> 00:13:15
Okay, now what's in that
subspace?

217
00:13:15 --> 00:13:21
So the column space of A,
it's a subspace of R^4.

218
00:13:21 --> 00:13:26
I call it the column space of
A, like that.

219
00:13:26 --> 00:13:34.21
So that's my little symbol for
some subspace of R^4.

220
00:13:34.21 --> 00:13:36
What's in that subspace?

221
00:13:36 --> 00:13:38
Well, that column certainly is.

222
00:13:38 --> 00:13:40.18
One two three four.

223
00:13:40.18 --> 00:13:41
This column is in.

224
00:13:41 --> 00:13:44
This column is in,
and what else?

225
00:13:44 --> 00:13:48
So it's got the columns of A in
it, but that's not enough,

226
00:13:48 --> 00:13:49.62
certainly.

227
00:13:49.62 --> 00:13:50
Right?

228
00:13:50 --> 00:13:55
I don't have a subspace if I
just put in three vectors.

229
00:13:55 --> 00:13:59
So how do I fill that out to be
a subspace?

230
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
I take their linear
combinations.

231
00:14:02 --> 00:14:06
So the column space of A is all
linear combinations --

232
00:14:06 --> 00:14:09
combinations of the columns.

233
00:14:09 --> 00:14:12
And that does give me a
subspace.

234
00:14:12 --> 00:14:17
It does give me a vector space,
because if I have one linear

235
00:14:17 --> 00:14:23
combination and I multiply by
eleven, I've got another linear

236
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
combination.

237
00:14:25 --> 00:14:29
If I have a linear combination,
I add to another linear

238
00:14:29 --> 00:14:32.66
combination I get a third
combination.

239
00:14:32.66 --> 00:14:36
So that -- this is like the
smallest space -- like,

240
00:14:36 --> 00:14:39
it's got to have those three
columns in it,

241
00:14:39 --> 00:14:44
and it has to have their
combinations and that's where we

242
00:14:44 --> 00:14:45
stop.

243
00:14:45 --> 00:14:45
Okay.

244
00:14:45 --> 00:14:49
Now I'm going to be interested
in that space.

245
00:14:49 --> 00:14:54
So I, like -- get some idea of
what's in that space.

246
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
How big is that space?

247
00:14:56 --> 00:15:02
Is that space the whole four
dimensional space?

248
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
Or is it a subspace inside?

249
00:15:04 --> 00:15:09
Can you -- let me just see if
we can get a yes or no answer

250
00:15:09 --> 00:15:13
sometimes without being ready
for the complete proof.

251
00:15:13 --> 00:15:15
What do you think?

252
00:15:15 --> 00:15:18
Is the subspace that I'm
talking about here,

253
00:15:18 --> 00:15:24
the combinations of those three
guys, does that fill the full

254
00:15:24 --> 00:15:26
four dimensional space?

255
00:15:26 --> 00:15:29
Maybe yes or no on that one.

256
00:15:29 --> 00:15:29
No.

257
00:15:29 --> 00:15:29
No.

258
00:15:29 --> 00:15:34
Somehow our feeling is,
and it happens to be right,

259
00:15:34 --> 00:15:38
that if we start with three
vectors and take their

260
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
combinations,
we can't get the whole four

261
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
dimensional space.

262
00:15:44 --> 00:15:48
Now -- so somehow we get a
smaller space.

263
00:15:48 --> 00:15:51
But how much smaller?

264
00:15:51 --> 00:15:54.62
That's going to come up here.

265
00:15:54.62 --> 00:15:57
That's not so immediate.

266
00:15:57 --> 00:16:03
Let me first make this critical
connection with --

267
00:16:03 --> 00:16:10.86
with, linear equations,
because behind our abstract

268
00:16:10.86 --> 00:16:15
definition, we have a purpose.

269
00:16:15 --> 00:16:19
And that is to understand Ax=b.

270
00:16:19 --> 00:16:26
So suppose I make the
connection -- w- w- does A x=b

271
00:16:26 --> 00:16:32.74
always have a solution for every
b?

272
00:16:32.74 --> 00:16:37
Have a solution for every
right-hand side?

273
00:16:37 --> 00:16:43
I guess that's going to be a
yes or no question.

274
00:16:43 --> 00:16:50
And then I'm going to ask which
right-hand sides are okay?

275
00:16:50 --> 00:16:58
That's really the question I'm
after, is which right-hand sides

276
00:16:58 --> 00:17:05
(b) do make up -- you can see
from the way I'm speaking what

277
00:17:05 --> 00:17:10
the question --
As it is.

278
00:17:10 --> 00:17:13
The answer is no.

279
00:17:13 --> 00:17:19
A x=b does not have a solution
for every b.

280
00:17:19 --> 00:17:22
Why do I say no?

281
00:17:22 --> 00:17:29
Because A x=b is -- like,
this is four equations,

282
00:17:29 --> 00:17:34
and only three unknowns.

283
00:17:34 --> 00:17:35
Right?

284
00:17:35 --> 00:17:44
X is -- let me right out that
whole -- what the whole thing

285
00:17:44 --> 00:17:46
looks like.

286
00:17:46 --> 00:17:46
Yeah.

287
00:17:46 --> 00:17:50
Let me write out A x=b.

288
00:17:50 --> 00:17:56
A x is -- these columns are one
two three four.

289
00:17:56 --> 00:18:04
One one one one and two three
four five.

290
00:18:04 --> 00:18:08
Then x, of course,
has three components,

291
00:18:08 --> 00:18:10
x1, x2, x3.

292
00:18:10 --> 00:18:16
And I'm trying to get the --
hit the right-hand side,

293
00:18:16 --> 00:18:18
b1,b2,b3 and b4.

294
00:18:18 --> 00:18:23
So my first point is,
I can't always do it.

295
00:18:23 --> 00:18:29
In a way, that just says again
what you told me five minutes

296
00:18:29 --> 00:18:34
ago --
that the combinations of these

297
00:18:34 --> 00:18:37
columns don't fill the whole
four dimensional space.

298
00:18:37 --> 00:18:41
There's going to be some
vectors b, a lot of vectors b,

299
00:18:41 --> 00:18:45
that are not combinations of
these three columns,

300
00:18:45 --> 00:18:48
because the combinations of
those columns are,

301
00:18:48 --> 00:18:53
like, going to be just a little
plane or something inside --

302
00:18:53 --> 00:18:54
inside R^4.

303
00:18:54 --> 00:19:00
Now, so and you see that I do
have four equations and only

304
00:19:00 --> 00:19:01
three unknowns.

305
00:19:01 --> 00:19:06
So, like anybody is going to
say, no you dope,

306
00:19:06 --> 00:19:11
you can't usually solve four
equations with only three

307
00:19:11 --> 00:19:13
unknowns.

308
00:19:13 --> 00:19:16
But now I want to say sometimes
you can.

309
00:19:16 --> 00:19:20
For some right-hand sides,
I can solve this.

310
00:19:20 --> 00:19:25
So that's the bunch of
right-hand sides that I'm

311
00:19:25 --> 00:19:27
interested in right now.

312
00:19:27 --> 00:19:31.45
Which right-hand sides allow me
to solve this?

313
00:19:31.45 --> 00:19:35
This is the question for today.

314
00:19:35 --> 00:19:41
It's going to have,
like, a nice clear answer.

315
00:19:41 --> 00:19:49
So my question is -- is which
bs, which vectors b,

316
00:19:49 --> 00:19:53.7
allow this system to be solved?

317
00:19:53.7 --> 00:19:59
And I want to ask you -- so
that's, like,

318
00:19:59 --> 00:20:07
gets two question marks to
indicate that's --

319
00:20:07 --> 00:20:10.23
this is the important question.

320
00:20:10.23 --> 00:20:14
Okay, first,
before we give a total answer,

321
00:20:14 --> 00:20:16
give me just a partial answer.

322
00:20:16 --> 00:20:21
Tell me one right-hand side
that I know I can solve this

323
00:20:21 --> 00:20:22
thing for.

324
00:20:22 --> 00:20:24
So -- all zeroes.

325
00:20:24 --> 00:20:24
Okay.

326
00:20:24 --> 00:20:28
That's the, like,
guaranteed.

327
00:20:28 --> 00:20:32
If these were all zero,
then I know I can solve it,

328
00:20:32 --> 00:20:36.43
let the x-s all be zero,
no problem.

329
00:20:36.43 --> 00:20:36
Okay.

330
00:20:36 --> 00:20:39
So that's always a -- okay.

331
00:20:39 --> 00:20:42
A x=0 I can always solve.

332
00:20:42 --> 00:20:47
Now tell me another right-hand
side, just a specific set of

333
00:20:47 --> 00:20:53
numbers for which I can solve
these three --

334
00:20:53 --> 00:20:57
these four equations with only
three unknowns,

335
00:20:57 --> 00:21:00
but if you give me a good
right-hand side,

336
00:21:00 --> 00:21:01
I can do it.

337
00:21:01 --> 00:21:03
So tell me one?

338
00:21:03 --> 00:21:04
STUDENT:1 2 3 4.

339
00:21:04 --> 00:21:06
STRANG: 1 2 3 4?

340
00:21:06 --> 00:21:10
If I -- can I solve -- is that
a good right-hand side?

341
00:21:10 --> 00:21:15
Can you solve --
can you find a solution that --

342
00:21:15 --> 00:21:18
X one plus X two plus two X
three is one,

343
00:21:18 --> 00:21:22.9
two X one plus X two plus three
X three is two and two more

344
00:21:22.9 --> 00:21:27.22
equations -- so I'm asking you
to solve in your head in --

345
00:21:27.22 --> 00:21:30
within five seconds,
four equations and three

346
00:21:30 --> 00:21:35
unknowns, but you can do it,
because the right-hand side is,

347
00:21:35 --> 00:21:40
like, showing up here is --
it's one of the columns.

348
00:21:40 --> 00:21:45
So tell me what's the X that
does solve it?

349
00:21:45 --> 00:21:47
One zero zero.

350
00:21:47 --> 00:21:51.89
One zero zero solves it,
because -- well,

351
00:21:51.89 --> 00:21:57
so you can multiply this out by
rows, but oh God,

352
00:21:57 --> 00:22:04
it's much nicer to say --
okay, this is one of this

353
00:22:04 --> 00:22:07
column, zero of this,
zero of this,

354
00:22:07 --> 00:22:12
so it's one of that column,
which is exactly what we

355
00:22:12 --> 00:22:13
wanted.

356
00:22:13 --> 00:22:14
Okay.

357
00:22:14 --> 00:22:17
So there is a b that's okay.

358
00:22:17 --> 00:22:23
Now tell me another B that's
okay, another right-hand side

359
00:22:23 --> 00:22:25
that would be all right?

360
00:22:25 --> 00:22:28
Well -- all ones?

361
00:22:28 --> 00:22:33
Actually -- and then what's the
solution in that case?

362
00:22:33 --> 00:22:34
0 1 0, thanks.

363
00:22:34 --> 00:22:37
And, in fact,
it's much e- like,

364
00:22:37 --> 00:22:42
one way to do it is think of a
solution first,

365
00:22:42 --> 00:22:47
right, and then just see what b
turns out to be.

366
00:22:47 --> 00:22:51.34
What b turns out to be,
right.

367
00:22:51.34 --> 00:22:52
Okay.

368
00:22:52 --> 00:22:58
So I think of a solution -- so
I think of an x,

369
00:22:58 --> 00:23:03
I think of any -- x1,
x2, x3, I do this

370
00:23:03 --> 00:23:09
multiplication and what have I
got?

371
00:23:09 --> 00:23:13
Now I'm ready to answer the big
question.

372
00:23:13 --> 00:23:19
I can solve A x=b exactly when
the right-hand side B is a

373
00:23:19 --> 00:23:22
vector in the column space.

374
00:23:22 --> 00:23:22
Good.

375
00:23:22 --> 00:23:28
I can solve A x=b when b is a
combination of the columns,

376
00:23:28 --> 00:23:34
when it's in the column space
-- so let me write that answer

377
00:23:34 --> 00:23:36
down.

378
00:23:36 --> 00:23:43
I can solve Ax=b exactly when B
is in the column space.

379
00:23:43 --> 00:23:48.67
Let me just say again why that
is.

380
00:23:48.67 --> 00:23:57.33
Because it -- the column space
by its definition contains all

381
00:23:57.33 --> 00:23:59
the combinations.

382
00:23:59 --> 00:24:03
It contains all the Ax-s.

383
00:24:03 --> 00:24:11
The column space really
consists of all vectors A times

384
00:24:11 --> 00:24:13.64
any X.

385
00:24:13.64 --> 00:24:17
So those are the bs that I can
deal with.

386
00:24:17 --> 00:24:23
If b is a combination of the
columns, then that combination

387
00:24:23 --> 00:24:26
tells me what X should be.

388
00:24:26 --> 00:24:32
If b is not a combination of
the columns, then there is no x.

389
00:24:32 --> 00:24:36
There's no way to solve A x
equal b.

390
00:24:36 --> 00:24:37
Okay.

391
00:24:37 --> 00:24:44
So the column space -- that's
really why we're interested in

392
00:24:44 --> 00:24:50
this column space,
because it's the central guy.

393
00:24:50 --> 00:24:56
It says when we can solve,
and that --

394
00:24:56 --> 00:24:59
we got to understand this
column space better.

395
00:24:59 --> 00:25:00
Let's see.

396
00:25:00 --> 00:25:03
Do I want to think -- yeah,
somehow -- oh,

397
00:25:03 --> 00:25:06
well, let's just -- as long as
we've got it here,

398
00:25:06 --> 00:25:10
what do I get for this
particular example?

399
00:25:10 --> 00:25:13.59
If I take combinations of this
and this and this,

400
00:25:13.59 --> 00:25:17
I'll tell you the question
that's in my mind.

401
00:25:17 --> 00:25:23
It's not even proper to use
this word yet,

402
00:25:23 --> 00:25:27
but you'll know what it means.

403
00:25:27 --> 00:25:32.41
Are those three columns
independent?

404
00:25:32.41 --> 00:25:40
If I take the combinations of
the three columns -- does each

405
00:25:40 --> 00:25:46
column contribute something new
or now?

406
00:25:46 --> 00:25:51
So that if I take the
combinations of those three

407
00:25:51 --> 00:25:53
columns, do I,
like, get some three

408
00:25:53 --> 00:25:58
dimensional subspace -- do I
have three vectors that are,

409
00:25:58 --> 00:26:00
like, you know,
independent,

410
00:26:00 --> 00:26:02.68
whatever that means?

411
00:26:02.68 --> 00:26:06
Or do I -- is one of those
columns, like,

412
00:26:06 --> 00:26:11
contributing nothing new --
So that actually only two of

413
00:26:11 --> 00:26:15
the columns would have given the
same column space?

414
00:26:15 --> 00:26:18.55
Yeah -- that's a good way to
ask the question.

415
00:26:18.55 --> 00:26:20
Finally I think of it.

416
00:26:20 --> 00:26:25
Can I throw away any columns --
and have the same column space?

417
00:26:25 --> 00:26:26
STUDENT: Yes.

418
00:26:26 --> 00:26:27
STRANG: Yes.

419
00:26:27 --> 00:26:31
And which one do you suggest I
throw away?

420
00:26:31 --> 00:26:33
STUDENT: Column three -- three.

421
00:26:33 --> 00:26:36.71
STRANG: Well,
three is the natural,

422
00:26:36.71 --> 00:26:38
like, guy to target.

423
00:26:38 --> 00:26:40
So if I -- and why?

424
00:26:40 --> 00:26:44
Because -- what's so bad about
three here?

425
00:26:44 --> 00:26:45
Column three?

426
00:26:45 --> 00:26:47
It's the sum of these,
right?

427
00:26:47 --> 00:26:51
So it's not -- if I'm taking --
if I have combinations of these

428
00:26:51 --> 00:26:55
two and I put in this one,
actually, I don't get anything

429
00:26:55 --> 00:26:55.57
more.

430
00:26:55.57 --> 00:26:59
So later on I will call these
pivot columns.

431
00:26:59 --> 00:27:05
And the third guy will not be a
pivot column in this -- with

432
00:27:05 --> 00:27:06
those numbers.

433
00:27:06 --> 00:27:12
Now actually -- honesty makes
me ask you this question.

434
00:27:12 --> 00:27:16
Could I have thrown away column
one?

435
00:27:16 --> 00:27:17
Yes, I could.

436
00:27:17 --> 00:27:19
I could.

437
00:27:19 --> 00:27:22
So when I say pivot columns,
my convention is,

438
00:27:22 --> 00:27:26
okay, I'll keep the first ones
as long as they're not

439
00:27:26 --> 00:27:26
dependent.

440
00:27:26 --> 00:27:29
So I keep this guy,
he's fine, he's a line.

441
00:27:29 --> 00:27:30
I keep the second guy.

442
00:27:30 --> 00:27:32
It's in a second direction.

443
00:27:32 --> 00:27:35
But the third one,
which is in the same plane as

444
00:27:35 --> 00:27:38.51
the first two gives me nothing
new.

445
00:27:38.51 --> 00:27:44
It's dependent in the language
that we will use and I don't

446
00:27:44 --> 00:27:45
need it.

447
00:27:45 --> 00:27:45
Okay.

448
00:27:45 --> 00:27:51
So I would describe the column
space of this matrix as a two

449
00:27:51 --> 00:27:54
dimensional subspace of R^4.

450
00:27:54 --> 00:27:58
A two dimensional subspace of
R^4.

451
00:27:58 --> 00:27:58
Okay.

452
00:27:58 --> 00:28:05
So you're seeing how these
vector spaces work and you --

453
00:28:05 --> 00:28:09
you're seeing that we -- some
idea of dependence or

454
00:28:09 --> 00:28:12
independence is in our future.

455
00:28:12 --> 00:28:13
Okay.

456
00:28:13 --> 00:28:17
Now I want to speak about
another vector space,

457
00:28:17 --> 00:28:18
the null space.

458
00:28:18 --> 00:28:24
So again I'm getting a little
ahead because it's in section

459
00:28:24 --> 00:28:26
three point two,
but that's okay.

460
00:28:26 --> 00:28:28
All right.

461
00:28:28 --> 00:28:32
Now I'm ready for the null
space.

462
00:28:32 --> 00:28:35
Let me keep the same matrix.

463
00:28:35 --> 00:28:41
And this is going to be a
different -- totally different

464
00:28:41 --> 00:28:42
subspace.

465
00:28:42 --> 00:28:44
Totally different.

466
00:28:44 --> 00:28:45
Okay.

467
00:28:45 --> 00:28:49
Now -- so let me make space for
it.

468
00:28:49 --> 00:28:54
Now --
here comes a completely

469
00:28:54 --> 00:28:59
different subspace,
the null space of A.

470
00:28:59 --> 00:29:00
What's in it?

471
00:29:00 --> 00:29:05
It contains not right-hand
sides b.

472
00:29:05 --> 00:29:07
It contains x-s.

473
00:29:07 --> 00:29:15
It contains all x-s that solve
-- this word null is going to --

474
00:29:15 --> 00:29:21
I mean, that's the key word
here, meaning zero.

475
00:29:21 --> 00:29:28
So this contains --
this is all solutions x,

476
00:29:28 --> 00:29:33
and of course x is our vectors,
x1, x2 and x3,

477
00:29:33 --> 00:29:36
to the equation A x=0.

478
00:29:36 --> 00:29:41
Well, four equations,
because we've got -- so,

479
00:29:41 --> 00:29:44
do you see what I'm doing?

480
00:29:44 --> 00:29:49
I'm now saying,
okay, columns were great,

481
00:29:49 --> 00:29:53
the column space we understood.

482
00:29:53 --> 00:29:56
Now I'm interested in x-s.

483
00:29:56 --> 00:30:02
I'm not -- the only b I'm
interested in now is the b of

484
00:30:02 --> 00:30:03
all zeroes.

485
00:30:03 --> 00:30:06
The right-hand side is now
zeroes.

486
00:30:06 --> 00:30:09
And I'm interested in
solutions.

487
00:30:09 --> 00:30:10
x-s.

488
00:30:10 --> 00:30:15
So t- where is this null space
for this example?

489
00:30:15 --> 00:30:20
These x-s are -- have three
components.

490
00:30:20 --> 00:30:29.58
So the null space is a subspace
-- we still have to show it is a

491
00:30:29.58 --> 00:30:32
subspace -- of R^3.

492
00:30:32 --> 00:30:39
So this is -- and we will show
-- these vectors x,

493
00:30:39 --> 00:30:45
this is in R^3,
where the column space was in

494
00:30:45 --> 00:30:49
R^4 in our example.

495
00:30:49 --> 00:30:54
For an m by n matrix,
this is m and this is n,

496
00:30:54 --> 00:31:00
because the number of columns,
n, tells me how many unknowns,

497
00:31:00 --> 00:31:06
how many x-s multiply those
columns, so it tells me the big

498
00:31:06 --> 00:31:10
space, in this case R three that
I'm in.

499
00:31:10 --> 00:31:15
Now tell me --
why don't we figure out what

500
00:31:15 --> 00:31:20
the null space is for this
example, just by looking at it.

501
00:31:20 --> 00:31:23
I mean, that's the beauty of
small examples,

502
00:31:23 --> 00:31:28.6
that my official way to find
null spaces and column spaces

503
00:31:28.6 --> 00:31:32
and get all the facts straight
would be elimination,

504
00:31:32 --> 00:31:34
and we'll do that.

505
00:31:34 --> 00:31:39
But with a small example,
we can see that --

506
00:31:39 --> 00:31:44
see what's going on without
going through the mechanics of

507
00:31:44 --> 00:31:46
elimination.

508
00:31:46 --> 00:31:51
So this null space -- so I'm
talking about -- again,

509
00:31:51 --> 00:31:55
the null space,
and let me copy again the

510
00:31:55 --> 00:31:56
matrix.

511
00:31:56 --> 00:32:01
One two three four,
one one one one and two three

512
00:32:01 --> 00:32:03
four five.

513
00:32:03 --> 00:32:05
What's in the null space?

514
00:32:05 --> 00:32:09
So I'm taking A times x,
so let me right it again,

515
00:32:09 --> 00:32:13
and I want you to solve those
four equations.

516
00:32:13 --> 00:32:18
In fact, I want you to find all
solutions to those four

517
00:32:18 --> 00:32:19
equations.

518
00:32:19 --> 00:32:23
Well, actually,
just first of all find one.

519
00:32:23 --> 00:32:27
Why should I ask you for all of
them?

520
00:32:27 --> 00:32:31
Tell me one -- well,
tell me one solution that y-

521
00:32:31 --> 00:32:35
you don't even have to look at
the matrix to know one solution

522
00:32:35 --> 00:32:37
to this set of equations.

523
00:32:37 --> 00:32:38
It is zero vector.

524
00:32:38 --> 00:32:43
Whatever that matrix is,
its null space contains zero --

525
00:32:43 --> 00:32:49
because A times the zero vector
sure gives the zero right-hand

526
00:32:49 --> 00:32:49
side.

527
00:32:49 --> 00:32:53
So the null space certainly
contains zero.

528
00:32:53 --> 00:32:57.78
A- so it's got a chance to be a
vector space now,

529
00:32:57.78 --> 00:33:00
and it will turn out it is.

530
00:33:00 --> 00:33:00
Okay.

531
00:33:00 --> 00:33:03
Tell me another solution.

532
00:33:03 --> 00:33:08
So this particular null space
-- and of course I'm going to

533
00:33:08 --> 00:33:13.63
call it N(A) for null space --
this contains-- well we've

534
00:33:13.63 --> 00:33:19
already located the zero vector,
and now you're going to tell me

535
00:33:19 --> 00:33:23
another vector that's in the
null space, another solution,

536
00:33:23 --> 00:33:28
another x, another --
you see what I'm asking you for

537
00:33:28 --> 00:33:31
is a combination of those
columns.

538
00:33:31 --> 00:33:35
That's what I'm always looking
at combinations of columns,

539
00:33:35 --> 00:33:40
but now I'm looking at the
weights, the coefficients in the

540
00:33:40 --> 00:33:41
combination.

541
00:33:41 --> 00:33:45
So tell me a good set of
numbers to put in there.

542
00:33:45 --> 00:33:48
One one -- STUDENTS:
Minus one.

543
00:33:48 --> 00:33:50
STRANG: One one minus one.

544
00:33:50 --> 00:33:51.22
Thanks.

545
00:33:51.22 --> 00:33:52
One one minus one.

546
00:33:52 --> 00:33:55
So there's a vector that's in
it.

547
00:33:55 --> 00:33:55.99
Okay.

548
00:33:55.99 --> 00:33:59
But have I got a subspace at
this point?

549
00:33:59 --> 00:34:01
Certainly not,
right?

550
00:34:01 --> 00:34:05
I've got just a couple of
vectors.

551
00:34:05 --> 00:34:07
No way they make a subspace.

552
00:34:07 --> 00:34:11
Tell me -- actually,
why don't I jump the whole way

553
00:34:11 --> 00:34:12
now?

554
00:34:12 --> 00:34:15
Tell me -- well,
tell me one more solution,

555
00:34:15 --> 00:34:18
one more X that would work.

556
00:34:18 --> 00:34:19
Student: 2 2 -2.

557
00:34:19 --> 00:34:20
STRANG: 2 2 -2?

558
00:34:20 --> 00:34:26
Oh, well, tell me all of them,
that would have been easier.

559
00:34:26 --> 00:34:29
Tell me the whole lot,
now.

560
00:34:29 --> 00:34:32
What is the null space for this
matrix?

561
00:34:32 --> 00:34:37
It's all vectors of the form --
what could this be?

562
00:34:37 --> 00:34:42
It could be one one minus one,
it could be it could be any

563
00:34:42 --> 00:34:48
number C, any number --
the same number again and --

564
00:34:48 --> 00:34:50
STUDENTS: Minus.

565
00:34:50 --> 00:34:51
STRANG: Minus C.

566
00:34:51 --> 00:34:57
In other words -- actually,
any multiple of this guy.

567
00:34:57 --> 00:35:02
Oh, that's the perfect
description, because now the

568
00:35:02 --> 00:35:08
zero vector's automatically
included because C could be

569
00:35:08 --> 00:35:09
zero.

570
00:35:09 --> 00:35:14
The vector I had is included,
because C could be one.

571
00:35:14 --> 00:35:16
But now any vector.

572
00:35:16 --> 00:35:18.69
And that's actually it.

573
00:35:18.69 --> 00:35:21.01
And do I have a subspace?

574
00:35:21.01 --> 00:35:23
And what does it look like?

575
00:35:23 --> 00:35:27
It's in -- how would you
describe this,

576
00:35:27 --> 00:35:30
the null space,
this --

577
00:35:30 --> 00:35:34
all these vectors of this form
C C minus C, like,

578
00:35:34 --> 00:35:36
seven seven minus seven.

579
00:35:36 --> 00:35:39
Minus eleven minus eleven plus
eleven.

580
00:35:39 --> 00:35:41
What have I got here?

581
00:35:41 --> 00:35:46
If -- describe that whole null
space of -- what -- if I drew

582
00:35:46 --> 00:35:47
it, what do I draw?

583
00:35:47 --> 00:35:48.95
A line, right?

584
00:35:48.95 --> 00:35:52
The null space is a line.

585
00:35:52 --> 00:35:57
It's the line through -- in R^3
and the vector one one negative

586
00:35:57 --> 00:36:02
one maybe goes down here,
I don't know where it goes,

587
00:36:02 --> 00:36:04
say, down here.

588
00:36:04 --> 00:36:09
There's the vector one one
negative one that you gave me.

589
00:36:09 --> 00:36:14
And where is the vector C C
negative C?

590
00:36:14 --> 00:36:16
It's on this line.

591
00:36:16 --> 00:36:20
Of course, there's zero zero
zero that we had.

592
00:36:20 --> 00:36:25.05
And what we've got is that
whole -- oops -- that whole

593
00:36:25.05 --> 00:36:28
line, going both ways,
through the origin.

594
00:36:28 --> 00:36:31
The null space is a line in
R^3.

595
00:36:31 --> 00:36:32
Okay.

596
00:36:32 --> 00:36:35
For that example,
we could find all the

597
00:36:35 --> 00:36:41
combinations of the columns that
gave zero at sight.

598
00:36:41 --> 00:36:48
Now, can I just take one more
time, to go back to the

599
00:36:48 --> 00:36:53
definition of subspace,
vector space,

600
00:36:53 --> 00:37:01
and ask you -- how do I know
that the null space is a vector

601
00:37:01 --> 00:37:02
space?

602
00:37:02 --> 00:37:08
How I entitled to use this word
space?

603
00:37:08 --> 00:37:15
I'll never use that word space
without meaning that the two

604
00:37:15 --> 00:37:19
requirements are satisfied.

605
00:37:19 --> 00:37:23
Can we just check that they
are?

606
00:37:23 --> 00:37:29
So I'm going to check that --
can I just continue here?

607
00:37:29 --> 00:37:36
Check that -- that the
solutions to A x=0 always give a

608
00:37:36 --> 00:37:37
subspace.

609
00:37:37 --> 00:37:45
And, of course,
the key word is that= "Space."

610
00:37:45 --> 00:37:48
So what do I have to check?

611
00:37:48 --> 00:37:53
I have to show that if I have
one solution,

612
00:37:53 --> 00:37:58
call it x, and another
solution, call it x*,

613
00:37:58 --> 00:38:02
that their sum is also a
solution, right?

614
00:38:02 --> 00:38:05.44
That's a requirement.

615
00:38:05.44 --> 00:38:11
To use that word space,
I have to say --

616
00:38:11 --> 00:38:18
I have to convince myself that
if A x is zero and also -- and A

617
00:38:18 --> 00:38:26
x* is zero, or maybe I should
have said if A v is zero and A w

618
00:38:26 --> 00:38:30
is zero, then what about v plus
w?

619
00:38:30 --> 00:38:34
Shall I -- let me use those
letters.

620
00:38:34 --> 00:38:41
If A v is zero and A w is zero,
then what --

621
00:38:41 --> 00:38:45
if that and that,
then what's my point here?

622
00:38:45 --> 00:38:48
That A times (v+w) must be
zero.

623
00:38:48 --> 00:38:53
That says that if v is in the
null space and w's in the null

624
00:38:53 --> 00:38:57.91
space, then their sum v+w is in
the null space.

625
00:38:57.91 --> 00:39:02
And of course,
now that I've written it down,

626
00:39:02 --> 00:39:07
it's totally absurd,
ridiculously simple --

627
00:39:07 --> 00:39:12
because matrix multiplication
allows me to separate that out

628
00:39:12 --> 00:39:14
into A v plus A w.

629
00:39:14 --> 00:39:17
I shouldn't say absurdly
simple.

630
00:39:17 --> 00:39:19
That was a dumb thing to say.

631
00:39:19 --> 00:39:24
Could -- we've used,
here, a basic law of matrix

632
00:39:24 --> 00:39:25
multiplication.

633
00:39:25 --> 00:39:32
Actually, we've used it without
proving it, but that's okay.

634
00:39:32 --> 00:39:36
We only live so long,
we just skip that proof.

635
00:39:36 --> 00:39:40.88
I think it's called the
distributive law that I can

636
00:39:40.88 --> 00:39:44
split these -- split this into
two pieces.

637
00:39:44 --> 00:39:49
But now you see the point,
that A v is zero and A w is

638
00:39:49 --> 00:39:54
zero so I have zero plus zero
and I do get zero.

639
00:39:54 --> 00:39:55
It checks.

640
00:39:55 --> 00:39:59
And, similarly,
I have to show that if A v is

641
00:39:59 --> 00:40:04.54
zero, then A times any multiple,
say 12v is also zero.

642
00:40:04.54 --> 00:40:06.67
And how do I know that?

643
00:40:06.67 --> 00:40:11
Because I'm allowed to s- bring
that twelve outside.

644
00:40:11 --> 00:40:16
A number, a scaler can move
outside, so I have twelve A vs,

645
00:40:16 --> 00:40:20
twelve zeroes --
I have zero.

646
00:40:20 --> 00:40:21
Okay.

647
00:40:21 --> 00:40:27
Just to -- it's really critical
to understand the -- oh yeah.

648
00:40:27 --> 00:40:34
Here -- I was going to say,
understand what's the point of

649
00:40:34 --> 00:40:35
a vector space?

650
00:40:35 --> 00:40:42
Let me make that point by
changing the right-hand side.

651
00:40:42 --> 00:40:43
Oops.

652
00:40:43 --> 00:40:43
Okay.

653
00:40:43 --> 00:40:48
Let me change the right-hand
side to one two three four.

654
00:40:48 --> 00:40:49
Oh, okay.

655
00:40:49 --> 00:40:54
Why don't we do all of linear
algebra in one lecture,

656
00:40:54 --> 00:40:56
then we -- okay.

657
00:40:56 --> 00:41:00
I would like to know the
solutions to this equation.

658
00:41:00 --> 00:41:03
For those four equations.

659
00:41:03 --> 00:41:06
So I have four equations.

660
00:41:06 --> 00:41:10
I have only three unknowns,
so if I don't have a pretty

661
00:41:10 --> 00:41:14
special right-hand side there
won't be any solution at all.

662
00:41:14 --> 00:41:17
But that is a very special
right-hand side.

663
00:41:17 --> 00:41:20
And we know that there is a
solution, one zero zero.

664
00:41:20 --> 00:41:22
Were there any more solutions?

665
00:41:22 --> 00:41:25
And did they form a vector
space?

666
00:41:25 --> 00:41:26
Okay.

667
00:41:26 --> 00:41:28
So I'm asking two questions
there.

668
00:41:28 --> 00:41:32
One is, do -- so my right-hand
side now is not zero anymore.

669
00:41:32 --> 00:41:36
I'm not looking at the null
space because I changed from

670
00:41:36 --> 00:41:37
zeroes.

671
00:41:37 --> 00:41:40
So my first question is,
do the solutions,

672
00:41:40 --> 00:41:44
if there are any and there are,
do they form a subspace?

673
00:41:44 --> 00:41:48
Let's answer that question
first.

674
00:41:48 --> 00:41:49
Yes or no.

675
00:41:49 --> 00:41:56.84
Do I get a subspace if I look
at the solutions to -- let me go

676
00:41:56.84 --> 00:41:58
back to x1 x2 x3.

677
00:41:58 --> 00:42:05
I'm looking at all the x-s,
at all those vectors in R^3

678
00:42:05 --> 00:42:08.11
that solve A x -b.

679
00:42:08.11 --> 00:42:18
The only thing I've changed is
b isn't zero anymore.

680
00:42:18 --> 00:42:28
Do the x-s, the solutions,
form a vector space?

681
00:42:28 --> 00:42:32
The solutions to this do not
form a subspace.

682
00:42:32 --> 00:42:35
The solutions don't,
because -- how shall I see

683
00:42:35 --> 00:42:36
that?

684
00:42:36 --> 00:42:40
The zero vector is not a
solution, so I never even got

685
00:42:40 --> 00:42:40
started.

686
00:42:40 --> 00:42:44
The zero vector doesn't solve
this system.

687
00:42:44 --> 00:42:48
I can't -- solutions can't be a
vector space.

688
00:42:48 --> 00:42:50
Now what are they like?

689
00:42:50 --> 00:42:54.82
Well, we'll see this,
but let's do it for this

690
00:42:54.82 --> 00:42:55
example.

691
00:42:55 --> 00:42:58
So one zero zero was a
solution.

692
00:42:58 --> 00:43:00
You saw that right away.

693
00:43:00 --> 00:43:03
Are there any other solutions?

694
00:43:03 --> 00:43:07
Can you tell me a second
solution to this system of

695
00:43:07 --> 00:43:09
equations?

696
00:43:09 --> 00:43:13
STUDENTS: 0 -1 1 STRANG:
0 -1 1.

697
00:43:13 --> 00:43:16
Boy, that's -- 0 -1 1.

698
00:43:16 --> 00:43:17
Yes.

699
00:43:17 --> 00:43:24
Because that says I take minus
this column plus this one and

700
00:43:24 --> 00:43:26
sure enough.

701
00:43:26 --> 00:43:28
That's right.

702
00:43:28 --> 00:43:32
So there are --
there's a bunch of solutions

703
00:43:32 --> 00:43:33
here.

704
00:43:33 --> 00:43:34
But they're not a subspace.

705
00:43:34 --> 00:43:36.35
I'll tell you what it's like.

706
00:43:36.35 --> 00:43:39
It's like a plane that doesn't
go through the origin,

707
00:43:39 --> 00:43:42
or a line that doesn't go
through the origin.

708
00:43:42 --> 00:43:45
Maybe in this case it's a line
that doesn't go through the

709
00:43:45 --> 00:43:48
origin, if I graft the solutions
to A x equal B.

710
00:43:48 --> 00:43:52.3
So you -- I think you've got
the idea.

711
00:43:52.3 --> 00:43:55
Subspaces have to go through
the origin.

712
00:43:55 --> 00:44:00
If I'm looking at x-s,
then they'd better solve Ax=0.

713
00:44:00 --> 00:44:05
In a way I've got -- my two
subspaces that I --

714
00:44:05 --> 00:44:10
talking about today are kind of
the two ways I can tell you what

715
00:44:10 --> 00:44:12.46
a -- about subspace.

716
00:44:12.46 --> 00:44:15
If I want to tell you about the
column space,

717
00:44:15 --> 00:44:20
I tell you a few columns and I
say take their combinations.

718
00:44:20 --> 00:44:22.91
Like I build up this subspace.

719
00:44:22.91 --> 00:44:26.71
I put in a few vectors,
their combinations make a

720
00:44:26.71 --> 00:44:28
subspace.

721
00:44:28 --> 00:44:33
Now, when I went to -- let me
come back to the one that is a

722
00:44:33 --> 00:44:34
subspace here.

723
00:44:34 --> 00:44:39
Here, when I talked about the
null space, I didn't tell you

724
00:44:39 --> 00:44:40
what's in it.

725
00:44:40 --> 00:44:43
We had to figure out what was
in it.

726
00:44:43 --> 00:44:48
What I told you was the
equations that I'm -- that has

727
00:44:48 --> 00:44:50
to be satisfied.

728
00:44:50 --> 00:44:56
You see those -- like,
those are the two natural ways

729
00:44:56 --> 00:44:59.99
to tell you what's in a
subspace.

730
00:44:59.99 --> 00:45:05.88
I can either give you a few
vectors and say fill it out,

731
00:45:05.88 --> 00:45:11
take combinations --
or I can give you a system of

732
00:45:11 --> 00:45:15
equations, the requirements that
the x-s have to satisfy.

733
00:45:15 --> 00:45:20
And both of those ways produce
subspaces and they're the

734
00:45:20 --> 00:45:23.54
important ways to construct
subspaces.

735
00:45:23.54 --> 00:45:26
Okay, so today's lecture
actually got,

736
00:45:26 --> 00:45:32
the essentials of three point
two, the idea of the null space.

737
00:45:32 --> 00:45:37
Now we have to tackle,
Wednesday, the job of how do we

738
00:45:37 --> 00:45:41
actually get hold of that
subspace in an example that's

739
00:45:41 --> 00:45:44
bigger and we can't see it just
by eye.

740
00:45:44 --> 00:45:45
Okay.

741
00:45:45 --> 00:45:46
See you Wednesday.

742
00:45:46 --> 00:45:49
Thanks.
