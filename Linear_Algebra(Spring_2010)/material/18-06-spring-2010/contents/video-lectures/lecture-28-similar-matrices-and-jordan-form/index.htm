<p></p> <p>Okay. This lecture is mostly about the idea of similar matrixes. I'm  going to tell you what that word similar means and in what way two  matrixes are called similar. But before I do that, I have a little more  to say about positive definite matrixes. You can tell this is a subject I  think is really important and I told you what positive definite meant  -- it means that this -- this expression, this quadratic form, x  transpose I x is always positive.</p> <p>But the direct way to test it  was with eigenvalues or pivots or determinants. So I -- we know what it  means, we know how to test it, but I didn't really say where positive  definite matrixes come from. And so one thing I want to say is that they  come from least squares in -- and all sorts of physical problems start  with a rectangular matrix -- well, you remember in least squares the  crucial combination was A transpose A.</p> <p>So I want to show that that's a positive definite matrix.</p> <p>Can -- so I -- I'm going to speak a little more about positive definite matrixes, just recapping -- so let me ask a question.</p> <p>It  may be on the homework. Suppose a matrix A is positive definite. I mean  by that it's all -- I'm assuming it's symmetric. That's always built  into the definition. So we have a symmetric positive definite matrix.  What about its inverse? Is the inverse of a symmetric positive definite  matrix also symmetric positive definite? So you quickly think, okay,  what do I know about the pivots of the inverse matrix? Not much. What do  I know about the eigenvalues of the inverse matrix? Everything, right?  The eigenvalues of the inverse are one over the eigenvalues of the  matrix.</p> <p>So if my matrix starts out positive definite, then right  away I know that its inverse is positive definite, because those  positive eigenvalues -- then one over the eigenvalue is also positive.</p> <p>What  if I know that A -- a matrix A and a matrix B are both positive  definite? But let me ask you this. Suppose if A and B are positive  definite, what about -- what about A plus B? In some way, you hope that  that would be true.</p> <p>It's -- positive definite for a matrix is  kind of like positive for a real number. But we don't know the  eigenvalues of A plus B. We don't know the pivots of A plus B. So we  just, like, have to go down this list of, all right, which approach to  positive definite can we get a handle on? And this is a good one. This  is a good one.</p> <p>Can we -- how would we decide that -- if A was  like this and if B was like this, then we would look at x transpose A  plus B x. I'm sure this is in the homework. Now -- so we have x  transpose A x bigger than zero, x transpose B x positive for all -- for  all x, so now I ask you about this guy.</p> <p>And of course, you just  add that and that and we get what we want. If A and B are positive  definites, so is A plus B. So that's what I've shown.</p> <p>So is A  plus B. Just -- be sort of ready for all the approaches through  eigenvalues and through this expression. And now, finally, one more  thought about positive definite is this combination that came up in  least squares. Can I do that? So now -- now suppose A is rectangular, m  by n.</p> <p>I -- so I'm sorry that I've used the same letter A for the  positive definite matrixes in the eigenvalue chapter that I used way  back in earlier chapters when the matrix was rectangular.</p> <p>Now, that matrix -- a rectangular matrix, no way its positive definite. It's not symmetric.</p> <p>It's not even square in general.</p> <p>But you remember that the key for these rectangular ones was A transpose A. That's square.</p> <p>That's  symmetric. Those are things we knew -- we knew back when we met this  thing in the least square stuff, in the projection stuff. But now we  know something more -- we can ask a more important question, a deeper  question -- is it positive definite? And we sort of hope so.</p> <p>Like,  we -- we might -- in analogy with numbers, this is like -- sort of like  the square of a number, and that's positive. So now I want to ask the  matrix question. Is A transpose A positive definite? Okay, now it's --  so again, it's a rectangular A that I'm starting with, but it's the  combination A transpose A that's the square, symmetric and hopefully  positive definite matrix.</p> <p>So how -- how do I see that it is  positive definite, or at least positive semi-definite? You'll see that.  Well, I don't know the eigenvalues of this product. I don't want to work  with the pivots. The right thing -- the right quantity to look at is  this, x transpose Ax -- A -- x transpose times my matrix times x.</p> <p>I'd  like to see that this thing -- that that expression is always positive.  I'm not doing it with numbers, I'm doing it with symbols. Do you see --  how do I see that that expression comes out positive? I'm taking a  rectangular matrix A and an A transpose -- that gives me something  square symmetric, but now I want to see that if I multiply -- that if I  do this -- I form this quadratic expression that I get this positive  thing that goes upwards when I graph it.</p> <p>How do I see that that's  positive, or absolutely it isn't negative anyway? We'll have to, like,  spend a minute on the question could it be zero, but it can't be  negative.</p> <p>Why can this never be negative? The argument is -- like  the one key idea in so many steps in linear algebra -- put those  parentheses in a good way.</p> <p>Put the parentheses around Ax and  what's the first part? What's this x transpose A transpose? That is Ax  transpose. So what do we have? We have the length squared of Ax.</p> <p>We  have -- that's the column vector Ax that's the row vector Ax, its  length squared, certainly greater than or possibly equal to zero. So we  have to deal with this little possibility. Could it be equal? Well, when  could the length squared be zero? Only if the vector is zero, right?  That's the only vector that has length squared zero.</p> <p>So we have  -- we would like to -- I would like to get that possibility out of  there. So I want to have Ax never -- never be zero, except of course for  the zero vector. How do I assure that Ax is never zero? The -- in other  words, how do I show that there's no null space of A? The rank should  be -- so now remember -- what's the rank when there's no null space? By  no null space, you know what I mean. Only the zero vector in the null  space. So if I have a -- if I have an 11 by 5 matrix -- so it's got 11  rows, 5 columns, when is there no null space? So the columns should be  independent -- what's the rank? n 5 -- rank n. Independent columns, when  -- so if I -- then I conclude yes, positive definite. And this was the  assumption -- then A transpose A is invertible -- the least squares  equations all work fine. And more than that -- the matrix is even  positive definite.</p> <p>And I just to say one comment about numerical things, with a positive definite matrix, you never have to do row exchanges.</p> <p>You  never run into unsuitably small numbers or zeroes in the pivot  position. They're the right -- they're the great matrixes to compute  with, and they're the great matrixes to study. So that's -- I wanted to  take this first ten minutes of grab the first ten minutes away from  similar matrixes and continue a -- this much more with positive  definite.</p> <p>I'm really at this point, now, coming close to the end  of the heart of linear algebra. The positive definiteness brought  everything together. Similar matrixes, which is coming the rest of this  hour is a key topic, and please come on Monday. Monday is about what's  called the SVD, singular values. It's the -- has become a central fact  in -- a central part of linear algebra.</p> <p>I mean, you can come  after Monday also, but -- Monday is, -- that singular value thing has  made it into this course. Ten years ago, five years ago it wasn't in the  course, now it has to be.</p> <p>Okay. So can I begin today's lecture proper with this idea of similar matrixes.</p> <p>This is what similar matrixes mean.</p> <p>So here -- let's start again. I'll write it again.</p> <p>So  A and B are similar. A and B are -- now I'm -- these matrixes -- I'm no  longer talking about symmetric matrixes, in -- at least no longer  expecting symmetric matrixes. I'm talking about two square matrixes n by  n. A and B, they're n by n matrixes. And I'm introducing this word  similar. So I'm going to say what does it mean? It means that they're  connected in the way -- well, in the way I've written here, so let me  rewrite it. That means that for some matrix M, which has to be  invertible, because you'll see that -- this one matrix is -- take the  other matrix, multiply on the right by M and on the left by M inverse.  So the question is, why that combination? But part of the answer you  know already. You remember -- we've done this -- we've taken a matrix A  -- so let's do an example of similar.</p> <p>Suppose A -- the matrix A  -- suppose it has a full set of eigenvectors. They go in this  eigenvector matrix S. Then what was the main point of the whole -- the  main calculation of the whole chapter was -- is -- use that eigenvector  matrix S and its inverse comes over there to produce the nicest possible  matrix lambda. Nicest possible because it's diagonal. So in our new  language, this is saying A is similar to lambda.</p> <p>A is similar to  lambda, because there is a matrix, and this particular -- there is an M  and this particular M is this important guy, this eigenvector matrix.  But if I take a different matrix M and I look at M inverse A M, the  result won't come out diagonal, but it will come out a matrix B that's  similar to A. Do you see that I'm -- what I'm doing is, like -- I'm  putting these matrixes into families. All the matrixes in one -- in the  family are similar to each other.</p> <p>They're all -- each one in this  family is connected to each other one by some matrix M and the -- like  the outstanding member of the family is the diagonal guy. I mean, that's  the simplest, neatest matrix in this family of all the matrixes that  are similar to A, the best one is lambda. But there are lots of others,  because I can take different -- instead of S, I can take any old matrix  M, any old invertible matrix and -- and do it. I'd better do an example.</p> <p>Okay. Suppose I take A as the matrix two one one two. Okay.</p> <p>Do you know the eigenvalue matrix for that? The eigenvalues of that matrix are -- well, three and one.</p> <p>So that -- and the eigenvectors would be easy to find.</p> <p>So this matrix is similar to this one.</p> <p>But  my point is -- but also, I can also take my matrix, two one one two, I  could multiply it by -- let's see, what -- I'm just going to cook up a  matrix M here.</p> <p>I'm -- I'll -- let me just invent -- one four one zero.</p> <p>And  over here I'll put M inverse, and because I happened to make that  triangular, I know that its inverse is that, right? So there's M inverse  A M, that's going to produce some matrix -- oh, well, I've got to do  the multiplication, so hang on a second, let -- I'll just copy that one  minus four zero one and multiply these guys so I'm getting two nine one  and six, I think.</p> <p>Can you check it as I go, because you -- see  I'm just -- so that's two minus four, I'm getting a minus two nine minus  24 is a minus 15, my God, how did I get this? And that's probably one  and six.</p> <p>So there's my matrix B. And there's my matrix lambda,  there's my matrix A and my point is these are all similar matrixes. They  all have something in common, besides being just two by two.</p> <p>They  have something in common. And that's -- and what is it? What's the  point about two matrixes that are built out of -- the B is built out of M  inverse A M. What is it that A and B have in common? That's the main --  now I'm telling you the main fact about similar matrixes. They have the  same eigenvalues.</p> <p>This is -- this chapter is about eigenvalues,  and that's why we're interested in this family of matrixes that have the  same eigenvalues. What are the eigenvalues in this example? Lambda.</p> <p>The eigenvalues of that I could compute.</p> <p>The eigenvalues of that I can compute really fast.</p> <p>So the eigenvalues are three and one -- for this for sure.</p> <p>Now  did we -- do you see why the eigenvalues are three and one for that  one? If I tell you the eigenvalues are three and one, you prick --  quickly process the trace, which is -- and four -- agrees with four and  you process the determinant, three times one -- the determinant is three  and you say yes, it's right.</p> <p>Now I'm hoping that the eigenvalues  of this thing are three and one. May I process the trace and the  determinant for that one? What's the trace here? The trace of this  matrix is four minus two and six, and that's what it should be. What's  the determinant minus twelve plus fifteen is three. The determinant is  three. The eigenvalues of that matrix are also three and one. And you  see I created this matrix just like -- I just took any M, like, one that  popped into my head and computed M inverse A M, got that matrix, it  didn't look anything special but it's -- like A itself, it has those  eigenvalues three and one.</p> <p>So that's the main fact and let me write it down.</p> <p>Similar matrixes have the same eigenvalues.</p> <p>So I'll just put that as an important point.</p> <p>And think why.</p> <p>Why  is that? So that's what that family of matrixes is. The matrixes that  are similar to this A here are all the matrixes with eigenvalues three  and one. Every matrix with eigenvalues three and one, there's some M  that connects this guy to the one you think of.</p> <p>And then of  course, the most special guy in the whole family is the diagonal one  with eigenvalues three and one sitting there on the diagonal. But also, I  could find -- I mean, tell me just a couple more members of the family.</p> <p>Another -- tell me another matrix that has eigenvalues three and one. Well, let's see, I -- oh, I'll just make it triangular.</p> <p>That's in the family. There is some M that -- that connects to this one. And -- and also this.</p> <p>There's  some matrix M -- so that M inverse A M comes out to be that. There's a  whole family here. And they all share the same eigenvalues.</p> <p>So why is that? Okay.</p> <p>I'm  going to start -- the only possibility is to start with Ax equal lambda  x. Okay, so suppose A has the eigenvalue lambda. Now I want to get B  into the picture here somehow. You remember B is M inverse A M. Let's  just remember that over here. B is M inverse A M.</p> <p>And I want to see its eigenvalues.</p> <p>How  I going to get M inverse A M into this equation? Let me just sort of do  it. I'll put an M times an M inverse in there, right? That was -- I  haven't changed the left-hand side, so I better not change the  right-hand side. So everybody's okay so far, I just put in there -- see,  I want to get a -- so now I'll multiply on the left by M inverse -- I  have to do the same to this side and that number lambda's just a number,  so it factors out in the front. So what I have here is this was safe. I  did the same thing to both sides. And now I've got B. There's B. That's  B times this vector M inverse x is equal to lambda times this vector M  inverse x.</p> <p>So what have I learned? I've learned that B times some vector is lambda times that vector.</p> <p>I've learned that lambda is an eigenvalue of B also.</p> <p>So  this is -- if -- so this is -- if lambda's an eigenvalue of A, then I  can write it this way and I discover that lambda's an eigenvalue of B.  That's the end of the proof.</p> <p>The eigenvector didn't stay the same.</p> <p>Of  course I don't expect the eigenvectors to stay the same. If all the  eigenvalues are the same and all the eigenvectors are the same, then  probably the matrix is the same. Here the eigenvector changes, so the  eigenvector -- so the point is then the eigenvector of B -- of B is M  inverse times the eigenvector of A. Okay.</p> <p>That's all that this  says here. The eigenvector of A was X, and so the M inverse -- similar  matrixes, then have the same eigenvalues and their eigenvectors are just  moved around. Of course, that's what we -- that's what happened way  back -- and the most important similar matrixes are to diagonalize.</p> <p>So what was the point when we diagonalized? The eigenvalues stayed the same, of course.</p> <p>Three  and one. What about the eigenvectors? The eigenvectors were whatever  they were for the matrix A, but then what were the eigenvectors for the  diagonal matrix? They're just -- what are the eigenvectors of a diagonal  matrix? They're just one zero and zero one.</p> <p>So this step made the eigenvectors nice, didn't change the eigenvalues, and every time we don't change the eigenvalues.</p> <p>Same eigenvalues. Okay.</p> <p>Now -- so I've got all these matrixes in -- I've got this family of matrixes with eigenvalues three and one.</p> <p>Fine. That's a nice family.</p> <p>It's nice because those two eigenvalues are different.</p> <p>I  now have to -- to get into that -- the -- into the less happy  possibility that the two eigenvalues could be the same. And then it's a  little trickier, because you remember when two eigenvalues are the same,  what's the bad possibility? That there might not be enough -- a full  set of eigenvectors and we might not be able to diagonalize. So I need  to discuss the bad case. So the bad -- can I just say bad? If lambda one  equals lambda two, then the matrix might not be diagonalizable.</p> <p>Suppose  lambda one equals lambda two equals four, say. Now if I look at the  family of matrixes with eigenvalues four and four, well, one possibility  occurs to me. One family with eigenvalues four and four has this matrix  in it, four times the identity.</p> <p>Then another -- but now I want  to ask also about the matrix four four one zero. And my point -- here's  the whole point of this -- of this bad stuff, is that this guy is not in  the same family with that one.</p> <p>The family of a -- of matrixes  that have eigenvalues four and four is two families. There's this total  loner here who's in a family off -- right? Just by himself.</p> <p>And all the others are in with this guy.</p> <p>So the big family includes this one.</p> <p>And  it includes a whole lot of other matrixes, all -- in fact, in this two  by two case, it -- you see where -- what do I mean -- so what I using,  this word family -- in a family, I mean they're similar. So my point is  that the only matrix that's similar to this is itself.</p> <p>The only matrix that's similar to four times the identity is four times the identity. It's off by itself.</p> <p>Why  is that? The -- if this is my matrix, four times the identity, and I  take it, I multiply on the right by any matrix M, I multiply on the left  by M inverse, what do I get? This is any M, but what's the result?  Well, factoring out a four, that's just the identity matrix in there. So  then the M inverse cancels the M, so I've just got this matrix back  again. So whatever the M is, I'm not getting any more members of the  family.</p> <p>So this is one small family, because it only has one person.</p> <p>One matrix, excuse me. I think of these matrixes as people by this point, in eighteen oh six.</p> <p>Okay, the other family includes all the rest -- all other matrixes that have eigenvalues four and four.</p> <p>This is somehow the best one in that family.</p> <p>See,  I can't make it diagonal. If I -- if it's diagonal, it's this one. It's  in its own, by itself. So I have to think, okay, what's the nearest I  can get to diagonal? But it will not be diagonalizable. That -- do you  know that that matrix is not diagonalizable? Of course, because if it  was diagonalizable, it would be similar to that, which it isn't. The  eigenvalues of this are four and four, but what's the catch with that  matrix? It's only got one eigenvector.</p> <p>That's a non-diagonalizable matrix.</p> <p>Only  one eigenvector. And somehow, if I made that one into a ten or to a  million, I could find an M, it's in the family, it's similar. But the  best -- so the best guy in this family is this one.</p> <p>And this is  called the Jordan -- so this guy Jordan picked out -- so he, like,  studied, these families of matrixes, and each family, he picked out the  nicest, most diagonal one. But not completely diagonal, because there's  nobody -- there isn't a diagonal matrix in this family, so there's a one  up there in the Jordan form.</p> <p>Okay. I think we've got to see some  more matrixes in that family. So, all right, let me -- let's just think  of some other matrixes whose eigenvalues are four and four but they're  not four times the identity. So -- and I believe that -- that this --  that all the examples we pick up will be similar to each other and -- do  you see why -- in this topic of similar matrixes, the climax is the  Jordan form.</p> <p>So it says that every matrix -- I'll write down what the Jordan form -- what Jordan discovered.</p> <p>He found the best looking matrix in each family.</p> <p>And that's -- then we've got -- then we've covered all matrixes including the non-diagonalizable one.</p> <p>That  -- that's the point, that in some way, Jordan completed the  diagonalization by coming as near as he could, which is his Jordan form.</p> <p>And therefore, if you want to cover all matrixes, you've got to get him in the picture.</p> <p>It used to be -- when I took eighteen oh six, that was the climax of the course, this Jordan form stuff.</p> <p>I  think it's not the climax of linear algebra anymore, because -- it's  not easy to find this Jordan form for a general matrix, because it  depends on these eigenvalues being exactly the same.</p> <p>You'd have  to know exactly the eigenvalues and it -- and you'd have to know exactly  the rank and the slightest change in numbers will change those  eigenvalues, change the rank and therefore the whole thing is  numerically not an -- a good thing. But for algebra, it's the right  thing to understand this family. So just tell me another matrix -- a few  more matrixes -- so more members of the family. Let me put down again  what the best one is. Okay.</p> <p>All right. Some more matrixes.</p> <p>Let's  see, what I looking for? I'm looking for matrixes whose trace is what?  So if I'm looking for more matrixes in the family, they'll all have the  same eigenvalues, four and four. So their trace will be eight.</p> <p>So  why don't I just take, like, five and three -- I've got the trace  right, now the determinant should be what? Sixteen. So I just fix this  up -- shall I put maybe a one and a minus one there? Okay.</p> <p>There's a matrix with eigenvalues four and four, because the trace is eight and the determinant is sixteen.</p> <p>And I don't think it's diagonalizable.</p> <p>Do you know why it's not diagonalizable? Because if it was diagonalizable, the diagonal form would have to be this.</p> <p>But I can't get to that form, because whatever I do with any M inverse and M I stay with that form.</p> <p>I could never get -- connect those.</p> <p>So  I can put down more members -- here -- here's another easy one. I could  put the four and the four and a seventeen down there. All these  matrixes are similar. If I'm -- I could find an M that would show that  that one is similar to that one. And in -- you can see the general  picture is I can take any a and any 8-a here and any -- oh, I don't  know, whatever you put it'd be -- anyway, you can see. I can fill this  in, fill this in to make the trace equal eight, the determinant equal  16, I get all that family of matrixes and they're all similar. So we see  what eigenvalues do.</p> <p>They're all similar and they all have only one eigenvector.</p> <p>So  I -- if I'm -- if you were going to -- allow me to add to this picture,  they have the same lambdas and they also have the same number of  independent eigenvectors.</p> <p>Because if I get an eigenvector for x I  get one for -- for A, I get one for B also. So -- and same number of  eigenvectors. But even more than that -- even more than that -- I mean,  it's not enough just to count eigenvectors. Yes, let me give you an  example why it's not even enough to count eigenvectors.</p> <p>So  another example. So here are some matrixes -- oh, let me make them four  by four -- okay, here -- here's a matrix. I mean, like if you want  nightmares, think about matrixes like these.</p> <p>Uh, so a one off the  diagonal -- say a one there, how many -- what are the eigenvalues of  that matrix? Oh, I mean -- okay. What are the eigenvalues of that  matrix? Please. Four 0s, right? So we're really getting bad matrixes  now.</p> <p>So I mean, this is, like -- Jordan was a good guy, but he  had to think about matrixes that all -- that had, like -- an eigenvalue  repeated four times.</p> <p>How many eigenvectors does that matrix have?  Well, I'm -- eigenvectors will be -- since the eigenvalue is zero,  eigenvectors will be in the null space, right? I'm -- eigenvectors have  got to be A x equal zero x.</p> <p>So what's the dimension of the null space? Two. Somebody said two.</p> <p>And  that's right. How -- why? Because you ask what's the rank of that  matrix, the rank is obviously two. The number of independent rows is  two, the number of independent columns is two, the rank is two so the  null -- the dimension of the null space is four minus two, so it's got  two eigenvectors. Two eigenvectors. Two independent eigenvectors. All  right.</p> <p>The dimension of the null space is two.</p> <p>Now, suppose I change this zero to a seven.</p> <p>The  eigenvalues are all still zero, how -- what about -- how many  eigenvectors? What's the dimension of the -- what's the rank of this  matrix now? Still two, right? So it's okay.</p> <p>And actually, this would be similar to the one that had a zero in there.</p> <p>But it's not as beautiful, Jordan picked this one.</p> <p>He  picked -- he put ones -- we have a one on the -- above the diagonal for  every missing eigenvector, and here we're missing two because we've got  two, so we've got two eigenvectors and two are missing, because it's a  four by four matrix.</p> <p>Okay, now -- but I was going to give you this second example.</p> <p>0 1 0 0, let me just move the one. Oop, not there. Off the diagonal and zero zero zero zero zero.</p> <p>Okay. So now tell me about this matrix. Its eigenvalues are four zeroes again. Its rank is two again.</p> <p>So it has two eigenvectors and two missing.</p> <p>But the darn thing is not similar to that one.</p> <p>A -- a count of eigenvectors looks like these could be similar, but they're not.</p> <p>Jordan -- see, this is like -- a little three by three block and a little one by one block.</p> <p>And this one is like a two by two block and a two by two block, and those blocks are called Jordan blocks.</p> <p>So  let me say what is a Jordan block? J block number I has -- so a Jordan  block has a repeated eigenvalue, lambda I, lambda I on the diagonal.</p> <p>Zeroes  below and ones above. So there's a block with this guy repeated, but it  only has one eigenvector. So a Jordan block has one eigenvector only.  This one has one eigenvector, this block has one eigenvector and we get  two.</p> <p>This block has one eigenvector and that block has one  eigenvector and we get two. So -- but the blocks are different sizes.  And that -- it turns out Jordan worked out -- then this is not similar,  not similar to this one. So the -- so I'm, like, giving you the whole  story -- well, not the whole story, but the main themes of the story --  is here's Jordan's theorem.</p> <p>Every square matrix A is similar to A Jordan matrix J.</p> <p>And  what's a Jordan matrix J? It's a matrix with these blocks, block --  Jordan block number one, Jordan block number two and so on.</p> <p>And let's say Jordan block number d.</p> <p>And  those Jordan blocks look like that, so the eigenvalues are sitting on  the diagonal, but we've got some of these ones above the diagonal. We've  got the number of -- so the number of blocks -- the number of blocks is  the number of eigenvectors, because we get one eigenvector per block.  So what I'm -- so if I summarize Jordan's idea -- start with any A.</p> <p>If its eigenvalues are distinct, then what's it similar to? This is the good case.</p> <p>if  I start with a matrix A and it has different eigenvalues -- it's n  eigenvalues, none of them are repeated, then that's a diagonal --  diagonalizable matrix -- the Jordan blocks is -- has -- the Jordan  matrix is diagonal.</p> <p>It's lambda. So the good case -- the good  case, J is lambda. All -- there are -- d=n. There are n eigenvectors, n  blocks, diagonal, everything great.</p> <p>But Jordan covered all cases by including these cases of repeated eigenvalues and missing eigenvectors.</p> <p>Okay. That's a description of Jordan.</p> <p>That -- that's -- I haven't told you how to compute this thing, and it isn't easy.</p> <p>Whereas  the good case is the -- the good case is what 18.06 is about. The --  this case is what 18.06 was about 20 years ago. So you can see you  probably won't have on the final exam the computation of a Jordan matrix  for some horrible thing with four repeated eigenvalues.</p> <p>I'm not that crazy about the Jordan form.</p> <p>But  I'm very positive about positive definite matrixes and about the idea  that's coming Monday, the singular value decomposition. So I'll see you  on Monday, and have a great weekend. Bye.</p>
