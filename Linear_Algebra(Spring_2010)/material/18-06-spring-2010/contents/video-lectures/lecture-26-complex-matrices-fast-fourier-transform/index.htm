<p></p> <p>Okay. This is a lecture where complex numbers come in. It's a --  complex numbers have slipped into this course because even a real matrix  can have complex eigenvalues. So we met complex numbers there as the  eigenvalues and complex eigenvectors.</p> <p>And we -- or -- this is  probably the last -- we have a lot of other things to do about  eigenvalues and eigenvectors. And that will be mostly real.</p> <p>But at one point somewhere, we have to see what you do when the numbers become complex numbers.</p> <p>What  happens when the vectors are complex, when the matrixes are complex,  when the -- what's the inner product of two, the dot product of two  complex vectors -- we just have to make the change, just see -- what is  the change when numbers become complex? Then, can I tell you about the  most important example of complex matrixes? It comes in the Fourier  matrix.</p> <p>So the Fourier matrix, which I'll describe, is a complex  matrix. It's certainly the most important complex matrix. It's the  matrix that we need in Fourier transform. And the -- really, the special  thing that I want to tell you about is what's called the fast Fourier  transform, and everybody refers to it as the FFT and it's in all  computer and it's used -- it's being used as we speak in a thousand  places, because it has, like, transformed whole industries to be able to  do the Fourier transform fast, which means multiplying -- how do I  multiply fast by that matrix -- by that n by n matrix? Normally,  multiplications by an n by n matrix -- would normally be n squared  multiplications, because I've got n squared entries and none of them is  zero.</p> <p>This is a full matrix. And it's a matrix with orthogonal  columns. I mean, it's just, like, the best matrix. And this fast Fourier  transform idea reduces this n squared, which was slowing up the  calculation of Fourier transforms down to n log(n). n log(n), log to the  base two, actually. And it's this -- when that hit -- when that  possibility hit, it made a big difference.</p> <p>Everybody realized  gradually what, -- that this simple idea -- you'll see it's just a  simple matrix factorization -- but it changed everything. Okay.</p> <p>So  I want to talk about complex vectors and matrixes in general, recap a  little bit from last time, and the Fourier matrix in particular. Okay.</p> <p>So what's the deal? All right.</p> <p>The main point is, what about length? I'm given a vector, I have a vector x.</p> <p>Or  let me call it z as a reminder that it's complex, for the moment. But I  can -- later I'll call the components x. They'll be complex numbers.</p> <p>But  it's a vector -- z1, z2 down to zn. So the only novelty is it's not in  R^n anymore. It's in complex n dimensional space. Each of those numbers  is a complex number. So this z,z1 is in C^n, n dimensional complex space  instead of R^n.</p> <p>So just a different letter there, but now the  point about its length is what? The point about its length is that z  transpose z is no good. z transpose z -- if I just put down z transpose  here, it would be z1, z2, to zn.</p> <p>Doing that multiplication doesn't give me the right thing.</p> <p>W-Why not? Because the length squared should be positive.</p> <p>And  if I multiply -- suppose this is, like, 1 and i. What's the length of  the vector with components 1 and i? What if I do this, so n is just two.  I'm in C^2, two dimensional space, complex space with the vector whose  components are 1 and i. All right.</p> <p>So if I took one times one and  i times i and added, z transpose z would be zero. But I don't -- that  vector is not -- doesn't have length zero -- the vector with the  components 1 and i -- this multiplication -- what I really want is z1  conjugate z1.</p> <p>You remember that z1 conjugate z1 is -- so you see  that first step will be z1 conjugate z1, which is the magnitude of z1  squared, which is what I want. That's, like, three squared or five  squared. Now, if it's -- if z1 is i, then I multiplied by minus i gives  one plus one, so the component of length -- the component i, its modulus  squared is plus one.</p> <p>That's great. So what I want to do then is do that -- I want z1 bar z1, z2 bar z2, zn bar zn.</p> <p>And remember that -- you remember this complex conjugate.</p> <p>So  -- so there's the point. Now I can erase the no good and put is good,  because that now gives the answer zero for the zero vector, of course,  but it gives a positive length squared for any other vector. So it's a  -- it's the right definition of length, and essentially the message is  that we're always going to be taking -- when we transpose, we also take  complex conjugate.</p> <p>So let's -- let's find the length of one -- so the vector one i, that's z, that's that vector z.</p> <p>Now I take the conjugate of one is one, the conjugate of i is minus i. I take this vector, I get one plus one -- I get two.</p> <p>So  that's a vector and that's a vector of length -- square root of two.  Square root of two is the length and not the zero that we would have got  from one minus i squared. Okay.</p> <p>So the message really is  whenever we transpose, we also take conjugates. So here's a symbol --  one symbol to do both. So that symbol H, it stands for a guy named  Hermite, who didn't actually pronounce the H, but let's pronounce it --  so I would call that z Hermitian z.</p> <p>I'll -- let me write that word, Herm- so his name was Hermite, and then we make it into an adjective, Hermitian.</p> <p>So z Hermitian z. z H z.</p> <p>Okay.  So, that's the -- that's the, length squared. Now what's the inner  product? Well, it should match. The inner product of two vectors -- so  inner product is no longer -- used to be y transpose x. That's for real  vectors.</p> <p>For complex vectors, whenever we transpose, we also take the conjugate. So it's y Hermitian x.</p> <p>Of course it's not real anymore, usually.</p> <p>That -- the inner product will usually be complex number.</p> <p>But  if y and x are the same, if they're the same z, then we have z -- z H  z, we have the length squared, and that's what we want, the inner  product of a vector with itself should be its length squared.</p> <p>So this is, like, forced on us because this is forced on us. So -- so this z -- this -- everybody's picking up what this equals.</p> <p>This is z1 squared plus zn squared.</p> <p>That's  the length squared. And that's the inner product that we have to go  with. So it could be a complex number now. One more change.</p> <p>Well,  two more changes. We've got to change the idea of a symmetric matrix.  So I'll just recap on symmetric matrixes. Symmetric means A transpose  equals A, but not -- no good if A is complex. So what do we instead --  that applies perfectly to real matrixes. But now if my matrixes were  complex, I want to take the transpose and the conjugate to equal A. So  there's -- that's the -- the right complex version of symmetry.</p> <p>The  com- the symmetry now means when I transpose it, flip across the  diagonal and take conjugates. So, for example -- here would be an  example. On the diagonal, it had better be real, because when I flip it,  the diagonal is still there and it has to -- and then when I take the  complex conjugate it has to be still there, so it better be a real  number, let me say two and five.</p> <p>What about entries off the  diagonal? If this entry is, say, three plus i, then this entry had  better be -- because I want whatever this -- when I transpose, it'll  show up here and i conjugate.</p> <p>So I need three minus I there. So there's a matrix with -- that corresponds to symmetry, but it's complex.</p> <p>And those matrixes are called Hermitian matrixes.</p> <p>Hermitian matrixes. A H equals A.</p> <p>Fine.  Okay, that's -- and those matrixes have real eigenvalues and they have  perpendicular eigenvectors. What does perpendicular mean? Perpendicular  means the inner product -- so let's go on to perpendicular. Well, when I  had perpendicular vectors, for example, they were like q1, q2 up to qn.  That's my -- q is my letter that I use for perpendicular. Actually, I  usually -- I also mean unit length. So those are perpendicular unit  vectors. But now what does -- so it's a -- orthonormal basis, I'll still  use those words, but how do I compute perpendicular? How do I check  perpendicular? This means that the inner product of qi with qj -- but  now I not only transpose, I must conjugate, right, to get zero if i is  not j and one if i is j.</p> <p>So it's a unit vector, meaning unit  length, orthogonal -- all the angles are right angles, but these are  angles in complex n dimensional space.</p> <p>So it's q1, q on- qi bar transpose.</p> <p>Or, for short, qi H qj.</p> <p>So  it will still be true -- so let me -- again I'll create a matrix out of  those guys. The matrix will have these q-s in its columns, q2 to qn.</p> <p>And  I want to turn that into matrix language, just like before. What does  that mean? That means I want all these inner products, so I take these  columns of Q, multiply by their rows -- so it was -- it used to be Q --  it used to be Q transpose Q equals I, right? This was an orthogonal  matrix.</p> <p>But what's changed? These are now complex vectors. Their  inner products are -- involve conjugating the first factor. So it's not  -- it's the conjugate of Q transpose.</p> <p>It's Q bar transpose Q. Q H.</p> <p>So  can I call this -- let me call it Q H Q, which is I. So that's our new  -- you -- you see I'm just translating, and the -- the book h- on one  page gives a little dictionary of the right words in the real case, R^n,  and the corresponding words in the complex case for the vector space  C^n.</p> <p>Of course, C^n is a vector space, the numbers we multiply  are now complex numbers -- we're just moving into complex n dimensional  space. Okay.</p> <p>Now -- actually, I have to say we changed the word  symmet- symmetric to Hermitian for those matrixes. People also change  this word orthogonal into another word that happens to be unitary, as a  word that applies -- that signals that we might be dealing with a  complex matrix here. So what's a unitary matrix? It's a -- it's just  like an orthogonal matrix.</p> <p>It's a square, n by n matrix with  orthonormal columns, perpendicular columns, unit vectors -- unit vectors  computed by -- and perpendicularity computed by remembering that  there's a conjugate as well as a transpose. Okay. So those are the  words. Now I'm ready to get into the substance of the lecture which is  the most famous complex matrix, which happens to be one of these guys.</p> <p>It  has orthogonal columns, and it's named after Fourier because it comes  into the Fourier transform, so it's the matrix that's all around us.</p> <p>Okay.  Let me tell you what it is first of all in the n by n case. Then often  I'll let n be four because four is a good size to work with.</p> <p>But here's the n by n Fourier matrix.</p> <p>Its  first column is the vector of ones. It's n by n, of course. Its second  column is the powers, the -- actually, better if I move from the math  department to EE for this one half hour and then, please, let me move  back again. Okay.</p> <p>What's the difference between those two  departments? It's just math starts counting with one and electrical  engineers start counting at zero. Actually, they're probably right.</p> <p>So anyway, we'll give them -- humor them.</p> <p>So this is really the zeroes column.</p> <p>And  the first column up to the n-1, that's the one inconvenient spot in  electrical engineering. All these expressions start at zero, no problem,  but they end at n-1.</p> <p>Well, that's -- that's the difficulty of  Course 6. So what's -- they're the powers of a number that I'm going to  call W -- W squared, W cubed, W to the -- now what is the W here? What's  the power? This was the zeroes power, first power, second power, this  will be n minus first power. That's the column.</p> <p>What's the next  column? It's the powers of W squared, W to the fourth, W to the sixth, W  to the two n-1. And then more columns and more columns and more columns  and what's the last column? It's the powers of -- let's see.</p> <p>We  -- actually, if we look around rows, w- this matrix is symmetric. It's  symmetric in the old not quite perfect way, not perfect because these  numbers are complex. And so it's -- that first row is all ones. One W W  squared up to W to the n-1. That's the last column is the powers of W to  the n-1, so this guy matches that, and finally we get W to something  here. I guess we could actually figure out what that something is.</p> <p>What  are the entries of this matrix? The i j entry of this matrix are -- I  going to -- are you going to allow me to let i go from zero to n minus  one? So i and g go from zero to n-1.</p> <p>So the one -- the zero zero entry is a one -- it's just this same W guy to the power i times j.</p> <p>Let's  see. I'm jumping into formulas here and I have to tell you what W is  and then you know everything about this matrix. So W is the -- well,  shall we finish here? What was this -- this is the (n-1) (n-1) entry.  This is W to the n-1 squared.</p> <p>Everything's looking like a mess here, because we have -- not too bad, because all the entries are powers of W.</p> <p>There -- none of them are zero. This is a full matrix.</p> <p>But  W is a very special number. W is the special number whose n-th power is  one. In fact -- well, actually, there are n numbers like that.</p> <p>One of them is one, of course.</p> <p>But the one we -- the W we want is -- the angle is two pi over n. Is that what I mean? n over two pi. No, two pi over n.</p> <p>W is E to the I and the angle is two pi over n.</p> <p>Right.  Where is this W in the complex plane? It's -- it's on the unit circle,  right? This is -- it's the cosine of two pi over n plus I times the sine  of two pi over n. But actually, forget this. It's never good to work  with the real and imaginary parts, the rectangular coordinates, when  we're taking powers. To take that to the tenth power, we can't see what  we're doing.</p> <p>To take this form to the tenth power, we see  immediately what we're doing. It would be e to the i 20 pi over n. So  when our matrix is full of powers -- so it's this formula, and where is  this on the complex plain? Here are the real numbers, here's the  imaginary axis, here's the unit circle of radius one, and this number is  on the unit circle at this angle, which is one n-th of the full way  round.</p> <p>So if I drew, for example, n equals six, this would be e  to the two pi, two pi over six, it would be one sixth of the way around,  it would be 60 degrees.</p> <p>And where is W squared? So I -- my W is e  to the two pi I over six in this case, in this six by -- for the six by  six Fourier transform, it's totally constructed out of this number and  its powers.</p> <p>So what are its powers? Well, its powers are on the  unit circle, right? Because when I square a number, a complex number, I  square its absolute value, which gives me one again. All the powers have  -- are on the unit circle. And the -- the angle gets doubled to a  hundred and twenty, so there's W squared, there's W cubed, there's W to  the fourth, there's W to the fifth and there is W to the sixth, as we  hoped, W to the sixth coming back to one. So those are the six -- can I  say this on TV? The six sixth roots of one, and it's this one, the  primitive one we say, the first one, which is W.</p> <p>Okay, so what --  let me change -- let me -- I said I would probably switch to n equal  four. What's W for that? It's the fourth root of one. W to the fourth  will be one.</p> <p>W will be e to the two pi i over four now. What's  that? This is e to the i pi over two. This is a quarter of the way  around the unit circle, and that's exactly i, a quarter of the way  around. And sure enough, the powers are i, i squared, which is minus  one, i cubed, which is minus i and finally i to the fourth which is one,  right.</p> <p>So there's W, W squared, W cubed, W to the fourth -- I'm  really ready to write down this Fourier matrix for the four by four  case, just so we see that clearly. Let me do it here.</p> <p>F4 is -- all right, one one one one one one one W -- it's I. I squared.</p> <p>That's minus one. i cubed is minus i.</p> <p>I'll -- I could write i squared and i cubed.</p> <p>Why  don't I, just so we see the pattern for sure. i squared, i cubed, i  squared, i cubed, i fourth, i sixth -- i fourth, i sixth and i ninth.</p> <p>You see the exponents fall in this nice -- the exponent is the row number times the column number, always starting at zero.</p> <p>Okay.  And now I can put in those numbers if you like -- one one one one, one i  minus one minus i, one minus one, one minus one and one minus i minus  one i.</p> <p>No. Yes.</p> <p>Right. What's -- why do I think that  matrix is so remarkable? It's the four by four matrix that comes into  the four point Fourier transform.</p> <p>When we want to find the  Fourier transform, the four point Fourier transform of a vector with  four components, we want to multiply by this F4 or we want to multiply  by F4 inverse.</p> <p>One way we're taking the transform, one way we're  taking the inverse transform. Actually, they're so close that it's easy  to confuse the two.</p> <p>The inverse of this matrix will be a nice  matrix also. So -- and that's, of course, what makes it -- that -- I  guess Fourier knew that.</p> <p>He knew the inverse of this matrix.</p> <p>A-  as you'll see, it just comes from the fact that the columns are  orthogonal -- from the fact that the columns are orthogonal, we will  quickly figure out what is the inverse. What Fourier didn't know --  didn't notice -- I think Gauss noticed it but didn't make a point of it  and then it turned out to be really important was the fact that this  matrix is so special that you can break it up into nice pieces with lots  of zeroes, factors that have lots of zeroes and multiply by it or by  its inverse very, very fast.</p> <p>Okay. But how did it get into this  lecture first? Because the columns are orthogonal. Can I just check that  the columns of this matrix are orthogonal? So the inner product of that  column with that column is zero.</p> <p>The inner product of column one with column three is zero.</p> <p>How  about the inner product of two and four? Can I take the inner product  of column two with column four? Or even the inner product of two with  three, let's -- let's see, does that -- let me do two and four.</p> <p>Okay. What -- oh, I see, yes, hmm. Hmm.</p> <p>Let's  see, I believe that those two columns are orthogonal. So let me take  their inner product and hope to get zero. Okay, now if you hadn't  listened to the first half of this lecture, when you took the inner  product of that with that, you would have multiplied one by one, i by  minus i, and that would have given you one, minus one by minus one would  have given you another one minus I by I would have been minus I  squared, that's another one.</p> <p>So do I conclude that the inner  product of columns -- I said columns two and four, that's because I  forgot those are columns one and three. I'm interested in their inner  product and I'm hoping it's zero, but it doesn't look like zero.  Nevertheless, it is zero. Those columns are perpendicular. Why? Because  the inner product -- we conjugate.</p> <p>Do you remember that the --  one of the vectors in the inner product has to get conjugated. So when I  conjugated, it changes that i to a minus i, changes this to a plus i,  changes those -- that second sine and that fourth sine and I do get  zero. So those columns are orthogonal. So columns are orthogonal.</p> <p>They're not quite orthonormal. But I could fix that easily. They -- all those columns have length two.</p> <p>Length  squared is four, like this -- the four I had there -- this length  squared, one plus -- one squared one squared one squared one squared is  four, square root is two -- so if I really wanted them -- suppose I  really wanted to fix life perfectly, I could divide by two, and now I  have columns that are actually orthonormal. So what? So I can invert  right away, right? O- orthonormal columns means -- now I'm keeping this  one half in here for the moment -- c- means F4 Hermitian, can I use  that, conjugate transpose times F4 is i.</p> <p>So I see what the inverse is. The inverse of F4 is -- it's just like an -- an orthogonal matrix.</p> <p>The inverse is the transpose -- here the inverse is the conjugate transpose. So, fine.</p> <p>That  -- that tells me that anything good that I learn about F4 I'll know the  same -- I'll know a similar fact about its inverse, because its inverse  is just its conjugate transpose.</p> <p>Okay, now -- so what's good?  Well, first, the columns are orthogonal. That's a key fact, then. That's  the thing that makes the inverse easy. But what property is it that  leads to the fast Fourier transform? So now I'm going to talk, in these  last minutes, about the fast Fourier transform.</p> <p>What -- here's  the idea. F6, our six by six matrix, will c- there's a neat connection  to F3, half as big. There's a connection of F8 to F4. There's a  connection of F(64) to F(32). Shall I write down what that connection  is? What's the connection of F(64) to F(32)? So F(64) is a 64 by 64  matrix whose W is the 64th root of one. So it's one 64th of the way  round in F(64). And it -- do- and F(32) is a 32 by 32 matrix. Remember,  they're different sizes. And the W in that 32 by 32 matrix is the 32nd  root of one, which is twice as far -- that -- you sh- see that key point  -- that's the -- that's how 32 and 64 are connected in the Ws.</p> <p>The  W for 64 is one 64th of the way -- so all I'm saying is that if I  square the W -- W(64), that's what I'm using for the one over -- the -- W  sixty f- this Wn is either the i two pi over n -- so W(64) is one 64th  of the way around it. When I square that, what do I get but W(32)?  Right? If I square this matrix, I double the angle -- if I square this  number, I double the angle, I get, the -- the W(32). So somehow there's a  little hope here to connect F(64) with F(32). And here's the  connection.</p> <p>Okay. Let me -- let me go back, -- yes, let me -- I'll do it here.</p> <p>Here's the connection. F(64).</p> <p>The  64 by 64 Fourier matrix is connected to two copies of F(32). Let me  leave a little space for the connection. So this is 64 by 64.</p> <p>Here's a matrix of that same size, because it's got two copies of F(32) and two zero matrixes.</p> <p>Those  zero matrixes are the key, because when I multiply by this matrix, just  as it is, regular multiplication, I would take -- need 64 -- I would --  I would have 64 squared little multiplications to do. But this matrix  is half zero.</p> <p>Well, of course, the two aren't equal.</p> <p>I'm going to put an equals sign, but there has to be some fix up factors -- one there and one there -- to make it true.</p> <p>The  beauty is that these fix up factors will be really -- almost all  zeroes. So that as soon as we get this formula right, we've got a great  idea for how to get from the sixty- from the 64 squared calculations --  so this original -- originally we have 64 squared calculations from  there, but this one will give us -- this is -- this will -- we don't  need that many -- we only need two times 32 squared, because we've got  that twice.</p> <p>And -- plus the fix-up. So I have to tell you what's  in this fix-up matrix. The one on the right is actually a permutation  matrix, a very simple odds and evens permutation matrix, the -- ones  show up -- I haven't put enough ones, I really need a -- 32 of these  guys at -- double space and then -- you see it's -- it's a permutation  matrix. What it does -- shall I call it P for permutation matrix? So  what that P does when it multiplies a vector, it takes the odd -- the  even numbered components first and then the odds.</p> <p>You see this --  this one skipping every time is going to pick out x0, x2, x4, x6 and  then below that will come -- will pick out x1, x3, x5. And of course,  that can be hard wired in the computer to be instantaneous.</p> <p>So  that says -- so far, what have we said? We're saying that the 64 by 64  Fourier matrix is really separated into -- separate your vector into the  odd -- into the even components and the odd components, then do a 32  size Fourier transform onto those separately, and then put the pieces  together again.</p> <p>So the pieces -- putting them together turns them  out to be I and a diagonal matrix and I and a minus, that same diagonal  matrix. So the fix-up cost is really the cost of multiplying by D, this  diagonal matrix, because there's essentially no cost in -- in the I  part or in the permutation part, so really it's -- the fix-up cost is  essentially because D is diagonal -- is 32 multiplications.</p> <p>That's  the -- there you're seeing -- of course we didn't check the formula or  we didn't even say what D is yet, but I will -- this diagonal matrix D  is powers of W -- one W W squared down to W to the 31st. So you see that  when I -- to do a multiplication by D, I need to do 32 multiplications.  There they are.</p> <p>Then -- but the other, the more serious work is  to do the F(32) twice on the -- separately on the even numbered and odd  numbered components, so twice 32 squared.</p> <p>So 64 squared is gone now. And that's the new count.</p> <p>Okay,  great, but what next? So that's -- I -- we now have the key idea -- we  would have to check the algebra, but it's just checking a lot of sums  that come out correctly. This is right -- the right way to see the fast  Fourier transform, or one right way to see it. Then you've got to see  what's the next idea. The next idea is to break the 32s down. Break  those 32s down.</p> <p>So we have this factor, and now we have the  F(32), but that breaks into some guy here -- F thirty- F six- F(16) --  F(16). Each -- each F(32) is breaking into two copies of F(16), and then  we have a permutation and then the -- so this is a -- like, this was a  64 size permutation, this is a 32 size permutation -- I guess I've got  it twice. So it's -- I'm -- I'm just using the same idea recursively --  recursion is the key word -- that on each of those F(32)s -- so here's  zero zero -- it's just -- to get F(32) -- this is the odd even  permutations -- so you see, we're -- the combination of those  permutations, what's it doing? This guy separates into odds -- in --  into evens and odds, and then this guy separates the evens into the ones  -- the numbers that are mult- the even evens, which means zero four  eight sixteen -- and even odds, which means two, six, ten, fourteen --  and then odd evens and odd odds. You see, together these permutations  then break it -- break our vector down into x, even even and three other  pieces.</p> <p>Those are the four pieces that separately get multiplied  by F(16) -- separately fixed up by these Is and Ds and Is and minus Ds  -- so this count is now reduced.</p> <p>This count is now -- what's it  reduced to? So that's going to be gone, because 32 squared -- that's --  that's the change I'm making, right? The 32 squared -- w- so -- so it's  this that's now reduced.</p> <p>So I still have two times it, but now what's 32 squared? It's gone in favor of two sixteen squareds plus sixteen.</p> <p>That's -- and then the original 32 to fix.</p> <p>Maybe  you see what's happening. Even easier than this formula is w- what's --  when I do the recursion more and more times, I get simpler and simpler  factors in the middle. Eventually I'll be down to two point or one point  Fourier transforms.</p> <p>But I get more and more factors piling up on the right and left.</p> <p>On  the right, I'm just getting permutation matrixes. On the left, I'm  getting these guys, these Is and Ds, so that there was a 32 there and --  each one of these is costing 32. Each one of those is costing 32. And  how many will there be? So you see the 32 for this original fix up,  because D had 32 numbers, 32 for this next fix up, because D has 16 and  16 more. I keep going. So the count in the middle goes down to zip, but  these fix up counts are all that I'm left with, and how many factors --  how many fix-ups have I got -- log in -- from 64, one step to 32, one  step to 16, one step to eight, four, two and one.</p> <p>Six steps. So I have six fix-up -- six fix up factors. Finally I get to six times the 32. That's my final count.</p> <p>Instead  of 64 squared, this is log to the base two of 64 times 64 -- actually,  half of 64. So actually, the final count is n log to the base two of n  -- that's the 32 -- a half.</p> <p>So can I put a box around that  wonderful, extremely important and satisfying conclusion -- that the  fast Fourier transform multiplies by an n by n matrix, but it does it  not in n squared steps, but in one half n log n steps.</p> <p>And if we  just -- complete by doing a count, let's suppose -- suppose -- a typical  case would be two to the tenth. Now n squared is bigger than a million.  So it's a thousand twenty four times a thousand twenty four. But what  is n -- what is one half -- what is the new count, done the right way?  It's n -- the thousand twenty four times one half, and what's the  logarithm? It's ten.</p> <p>So times ten over two. So it's five times --  it's five times a thousand twenty four, where this one was a thousand  twenty four times a thousand twenty four.</p> <p>We've reduced the calculation by a factor of 200 just by factoring the matrix properly.</p> <p>This was a thousand times n, we're now down to five times n.</p> <p>So  we can do 200 Fourier transforms, where before we could do one, and in  real scientific calculations where Fourier transforms are happening all  the time, we're saving a factor of 200 in one of the major steps of  modern scientific computing.</p> <p>So that's the idea of the fast  Fourier transform, and you see the whole thing hinged on being a special  matrix with orthonormal columns. Okay, that's actually it for complex  numbers. I'm back next time really to -- to real numbers, eigenvalues  and eigenvectors and the key idea of positive definite matrixes is going  to show up. What's a positive definite matrix? And it's terrific that  this course is going to reach positive definiteness, because those are  the matrixes that you see the most in applications. Okay, see you next  time.</p> <p>Thanks.</p>
