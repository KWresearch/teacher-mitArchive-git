<p></p> <p>-- and lift-off on differential equations.</p> <p>So, this section is  about how to solve a system of first order, first derivative, constant  coefficient linear equations. And if we do it right, it turns directly  into linear algebra. The key idea is the solutions to constant  coefficient linear equations are exponentials. So if you look for an  exponential, then all you have to find is what's up there in the  exponent and what multiplies the exponential and that's the linear  algebra. So -- and the result -- one thing we will fine -- it's  completely parallel to powers of a matrix. So the last lecture was about  how would you compute A to the K or A to the 100? How do you compute  high powers of a matrix? Now it's not powers anymore, but it's  exponentials.</p> <p>That's the natural thing for differential equation.</p> <p>Okay.  But can I begin with an example? And I'll just go through the  mechanics. How would I solve the differential -- two differential  equations? So I'm going to make it -- I'll have a two by two matrix and  the coefficients are minus one two, one minus two and I'd better give  you some initial condition. So suppose it starts u at times zero -- this  is u1, u2 -- let it -- let it -- suppose everything is in u1 at times  zero.</p> <p>So -- at -- at the start, it's all in u1.</p> <p>But what  happens as time goes on, du2/dt will -- will be positive, because of  that u1 term, so flow will move into the u2 component and it will go out  of the u1 component. So we'll just follow that movement as time goes  forward by looking at the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of that matrix.  That's a first job. Before you do anything else, find the -- find the  matrix and its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.</p> <p>So let me do that. Okay.</p> <p>So  here's our matrix. Maybe you can tell me right away what -- what are  the eigenvalues and -- eigenvalues anyway. And then we can check.</p> <p>But can you spot any of the eigenvalues of that matrix? We're looking for two eigenvalues.</p> <p>Do you see -- I mean, if I just wrote that matrix down, what -- what do you notice about it? It's singular, right.</p> <p>That -- that's a singular matrix.</p> <p>That  tells me right away that one of the eigenvalues is lambda equals zero. I  can -- that's a singular matrix, the second column is minus two times  the first column, the determinant is zero, it's -- it's singular, so  zero is an eigenvalue and the other eigenvalue will be -- from the  trace. I look at the trace, the sum down the diagonal is minus three.</p> <p>That  has to agree with the sum of the eigenvalue, so that second eigenvalue  better be minus three. I could, of course -- I could compute -- why  don't I over here -- compute the determinant of A minus lambda I, the  determinant of this minus one minus lambda two one minus two minus  lambda matrix. But we know what's coming.</p> <p>When I do that multiplication, I get a lambda squared.</p> <p>I  get a two lambda and a one lambda, that's a three lambda. And then --  now I'm going to get the determinant, which is two minus two which is  zero. So there's my characteristic polynomial, this determinant. And of  course I factor that into lambda times lambda plus three and I get the  two eigenvalues that we saw coming.</p> <p>What else do I need? The eigenvectors.</p> <p>So  before I even think about the differential equation or what -- how to  solve it, let me find the eigenvectors for this matrix. Okay.</p> <p>So  take lambda equals zero -- so that -- that's the first eigenvalue.  Lambda one equals zero and the second eigenvalue will be lambda two  equals minus three.</p> <p>By the way, I -- I already know something important about this.</p> <p>The  eigenvalues are telling me something. You'll see how it comes out, but  let me point to -- these numbers are -- this eigenvalue, a negative  eigenvalue, is going to disappear. There's going to be an e to the minus  three t in the answer. That e to the minus three t as times goes on is  going to be very, very small.</p> <p>The other part of the answer will  involve an e to the zero t. But e to the zero t is one and that's a  constant. So I'm expecting that this solution'll have two parts, an e to  the zero t part and an e to the minus three t part, and that -- and as  time goes on, the second part'll disappear and the first part will be a  steady state.</p> <p>It won't move. It will be -- at the end of -- as t  approaches infinity, this part disappears and this is the -- the e to  the zero t part is what I get.</p> <p>And I'm very interested in these steady states, so that's -- I get a steady state when I have a zero eigenvalue. Okay.</p> <p>What  about those eigenvectors? So what's the eigenvector that goes with  eigenvalue zero? Okay. The matrix is singular as it is, the eigenvector  is -- is the guy in the null space, so what vector is in the null space  of that matrix? Let's see. I guess I probably give the free variable the  value one and I realize that if I want to get zero I need a two up  here. Okay? So Ax1 is zero x1. A x1 is zero x1.</p> <p>Fine. Okay.</p> <p>What about the other eigenvalue? Lambda two is minus three. Okay.</p> <p>How  do I get the other eigenvalue, then? For the moment -- can I mentally  do it? I subtract minus three along the diagonal, which means I add  three -- can I -- I'll just do it with an erase -- erase for the moment.  So I'm going to add three to the diagonal. So this minus one will  become a two and -- I'll make it in big loopy letters -- and when I add  three to this guy, the minus two becomes -- well, I can't make one very  loopy, but how's that? Okay. Now that's A minus three I -- A plus three  I, sorry.</p> <p>That's A plus three I. It's supposed to be singular,  right? I-- if things -- if I did it right, this matrix should be  singular and the x2, the eigenvector should be in its null space.</p> <p>Okay.  What do I get for the null space of this? Maybe minus one one, or one  minus one. Doesn't matter. Those are both perfectly good. Right? Because  that's in the null space of this.</p> <p>Now I'll -- because A times that vector is three times that vector. Ax2 is minus three x2. Good.</p> <p>Okay. Can I get A again so we see that correctly? That was a minus one and that was a minus two. Good.</p> <p>Okay. That -- that's the first job.</p> <p>eigenvalues and eigenvectors. And already the eigenvalues are telling me the most important information about the answer.</p> <p>But  now, what is the answer? The answer is -- the solution will be U of T  -- okay. Now, wh- now I use those eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The  solution is some -- there are two eigenvalues. So I -- it -- so there're  going to be two special solutions here.</p> <p>Two pure exponential  solutions. The first one is going to be either the lambda one tx1 and  the -- so that solves the equation, and so does this one. They both are  solutions to the differential equation. That's the general solution.</p> <p>The general solution is a combination of that pure exponential solution and that pure exponential solution.</p> <p>Can  I just see that those guys do solve the equation? So let me just check  -- check on this one, for example. Check. I -- I want to check that the  -- my equation -- let's remember, the equation -- du/dt is Au. I plug in  e to the lambda one t x1 and let's just see that the equation's okay.</p> <p>I believe this is a solution to that equation.</p> <p>So  just plug it in. On the left-hand side, I take the time derivative --  so the left-hand side will be lambda one, e to the lambda one t x1,  right? The time derivative -- this is the term that depends on time,  it's just ordinary exponential, its derivative brings down a lambda one.</p> <p>On  the other side of the equation it's A times this thing. A times either  the lambda one t x one, and does that check out? Do we have equality  there? Yes, because either the lambda one t appears on both sides and  the other one is Ax1 equal lambda one x1 -- check. Do you -- so, the --  we've come to the first point to remember.</p> <p>These pure solutions.  Those pure solutions are the -- those pure exponentials are the  differential equations analogue of -- last time we had pure powers.</p> <p>Last  time -- so -- so last time, the analog was lambda -- lambda one to the  K-th power x1, some amount of that, plus some amount of lambda two to  the K-th power x2. That was our formula from last time. I put it up just  to -- so your eye compares those two formulas. Powers of lambda in the  -- in the difference equation -- that -- this was in the -- this was for  the equation uk plus one equals A uk.</p> <p>That was for the finite step -- stepping by one.</p> <p>And we got powers, now this is the one we're interested in, the exponentials.</p> <p>So  -- so that's -- that's the solution -- what are c1 and c2? Then we're  through. What are c1 and c2? Well, of course we know these actual  things. Let me just -- let me come back to this.</p> <p>c1 is -- we  haven't figured out yet, but e to the lambda one t, the lambda one is  zero so that's just a one times x1 which is two one. So it's c1 times  this one that's not moving times the vector, the eigenvector two one and  c2 times -- what's e to the lambda two t? Lambda two is minus three. So  this is the term that has the minus three t and its eigenvector is this  one minus one. So this vector solves the equation and any multiple of  it. This vector solves the equation if it's got that factor e to the  minus three t. We've got the answer except for c1 and c2. So -- so  everything I've done is immediate as soon as you know the eigenvalues  and eigenvectors. So how do we get c1 and c2? That has to come from the  initial condition.</p> <p>So now I -- now I use -- u of zero is given as one zero.</p> <p>So  this is the initial condition that will find c1 and c2. So let me do  that on the board underneath. At t equals zero, then -- I get c1 times  this guy plus c2 and now I'm at times zero. So that's a one and this is a  one minus one and that's supposed to agree with u of zero one zero.  Okay. That should be two equations. That should give me c1 and c2 and  then I'm through. So what are c1 and c2? Let's see.</p> <p>I guess we could actually spot them by eye or we could solve two equations in two unknowns. Let's see.</p> <p>If  these were both ones -- so I'm just adding -- then I would get three  zero. So what's the -- what's the solution, then? If -- if c1 and c2 are  both ones, I get three zero, so I want, like, one third of that,  because I want to get one zero.</p> <p>So I think it's c1 equals a third, c2 equals a third.</p> <p>So  finally I have the answer. Let me keep it in the -- in this board here.  Finally the answer is one third of this plus one third of this.</p> <p>Do you see what -- what's actually happening with this flow? This flow started out at -- the solution started out at one zero.</p> <p>Started at one zero. Then as time went on, people moved, essentially.</p> <p>Some fraction of this one moved here.</p> <p>And  -- and in the limit, there's -- there's the limit, as -- right? As t  goes to infinity, as t gets very large, this disappears and this is the  steady state. So the steady state is -- so the steady state -- u -- we  could call it u at infinity is one third of two and one. It's -- it's  two thirds of one third. So that's the -- we really -- I mean, you're  getting, like, total, insight into the behavior of the solution, what  the differential equation does.</p> <p>Of course, we don't -- wouldn't always have a steady state.</p> <p>Sometimes we would approach zero.</p> <p>Sometimes  we would blow up. Can we straighten out those cases? The eigenvalue  should tell us. So when do we get -- so -- so let me ask first, when do  we get stability? That's u of t going to zero.</p> <p>When would the solution go to zero no matter what the initial condition is? Negative eigenvalues, right. Negative eigenvalues.</p> <p>But now I have to -- I have to ask you for one more step.</p> <p>Suppose  the eigenvalues are complex numbers? Because we know they could be.  Then we want stability -- this -- this -- we want -- we need all these e  to the lambda t-s all going to zero and somehow that asks us to have  lambda negative. But suppose lambda is a complex number? Then what's the  test? What -- if lambda's a complex number like, oh, suppose lambda is  negative plus an imaginary part? Say lambda is minus three plus six i?  What -- what happens then? Can we just, like, do a -- a case here? If --  if this lambda is minus three plus six it, how big is that number? Does  this -- does this imaginary part play a -- play a -- play a role here  or not? Or how big is -- what's the absolute value of that -- of that  quantity? It's just e to the minus three t, right? Because this other  part, this -- the -- the magnitude -- the -- this -- e to the six it --  what -- that has absolute value one. Right? That's just this cosine of  six t plus i, sine of six t.</p> <p>And the absolute value squared will  be cos squared plus sine squared will be one. This is -- this complex  number is running around the unit circle.</p> <p>This com- this -- the -- it's the real part that matters.</p> <p>This  is what I'm trying to do. Real part of lambda has to be negative. If  lambda's a complex number, it's the real part, the minus three, that  either makes us go to zero or doesn't, or let -- or blows up. The  imaginary part won't -- will just, like, oscillate between the two  components. Okay.</p> <p>So that's stability. And what about -- what  about a steady state? When would we have, a steady state, always in the  same direction? So let me -- I'll take this part away -- when -- so that  was, like, checking that it's -- that it's the real part that we care  about. Now, we have a steady state when -- when lambda one is zero and  the other eigenvalues have what? So I'm looking -- like, that example  was, like, perfect for a steady state.</p> <p>We have a zero eigenvalue  and the other eigenvalues, we want those to disappear. So the other  eigenvalues have real part negative. And we blow up, for sure -- we blow  up if any real part of lambda is positive.</p> <p>So if I -- if I  reverse the sign of A -- of the matrix A -- suppose instead of the  matrix I had, the A that I had, I changed it -- I changed all its sines.</p> <p>What  would that do to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors? If I -- if -- if I  know the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A, tell me about minus A.</p> <p>What happens to the eigenvalues? For minus A, they'll all change sine.</p> <p>So  I'll have blow up. This -- instead of the e to the minus three t, if I  change that to minus -- if I change the sines in that matrix, I would  change the trace to plus three, I would have an e to the plus three t  and I would have blow up. Of course the zero eigenvalue would stay at  zero, but the other guy is taking off in -- if I reversed all the sines.  Okay.</p> <p>So this is -- this is the stability picture.</p> <p>And  for a two by two matrix, we can actually pin down even more closely what  that means. Can I -- let -- can I do that? Let me do that -- I want to  -- for a two by two matrix, I can tell whether the real part of the  eigenvalues is negative, I -- well, let me -- let me tell you what I  have in mind for that.</p> <p>So two by two stability -- let me -- this  is just a little comment. Two by two stability. So my matrix, now, is  just a b c d and I'm looking for the real parts of both eigenvalues to  be negative.</p> <p>Okay. What -- how can I tell from looking at the  matrix, without computing its eigenvalues, whether the two eigenvalues  are negative, or at least their real parts are negative? What would that  tell me about the trace? So -- so the trace -- that's this a plus d --  what can you tell me about the trace in the case of a two by two stable  matrix? That means the eigenvalues have -- are negative, or at least the  real parts of those eigenvalues are negative -- then, when I take the  -- when I look at the matrix and find its trace, what -- what do I know  about that? It's negative, right.</p> <p>This is the sum of the -- this  equals -- this equals lambda one plus lambda two, so it's negative. The  two eigenvalues, by the way, will have -- if they're complex -- will  have plus six i and minus six i. The complex parts will -- will be  conjugates of each other and disappear when we add and the trace will be  negative.</p> <p>Okay, the trace has to be negative.</p> <p>Is that  enough -- is a negative trace enough to make the matrix stable?  Shouldn't be enough, right? Can I -- can you make -- what's a matrix  that has a negative trace but still it's not stable? So it -- it has a  blow -- it still has a blow-up factor and a -- and a -- and a decaying  one. So what would be a -- so just -- just to see -- maybe I just put  that here.</p> <p>This -- now I'm looking for an example where the trace  could be negative but still blow up. Of course -- yeah, let's just take  one. Oh, look, let me -- let me make it minus two zero zero one. Okay.</p> <p>There's a case where that matrix has negative trace -- I know its eigenvalues of course.</p> <p>They're minus two and one and it blows up.</p> <p>It's  got -- it's got a plus one eigenvalue here, so there would be an e to  the plus t in the solution and it'll blow up if it has any second  component at all.</p> <p>I need another condition. And it's a condition  on the determinant. And what's that condition? If I know that the two  eigenvalues -- suppose I know they're negative, both negative.</p> <p>What  does that tell me about the determinant? Let me ask again. If I know  both the eigenvalues are negative, then I know the trace is negative but  the determinant is positive, because it's the product of the two  eigenvalues. So this determinant is lambda one times lambda two. This is  -- this is lambda one times lambda two and if they're both negative,  the product is positive. So positive determinant, negative trace. I can  easily track down the -- this condition also for the -- if -- if there's  an imaginary part hanging around. Okay.</p> <p>So that's a -- like a small but quite useful, because two by two is always important -- comment on stability. Okay.</p> <p>So let's just look at the picture again.</p> <p>Okay.  The main part of my lecture, the one thing you want to be able to,  like, just do automatically is this step of solving the system.</p> <p>Find  the eigenvalues, find the eigenvectors, find the coefficients. And  notice -- what's the matrix -- in this linear system here, I can't help  -- if I -- if I have equations like that -- that's my equations column  at a time -- what's the matrix form of that equation? So -- so this --  this system of equations is -- is some matrix multiplying c1, c2 to give  u of zero. One zero.</p> <p>What's the matrix? Well, it's obviously two  one, one minus one, but we have a name, or at least a letter --  actually a name for that matrix. Wh- what matrix are we s- are we -- are  we dealing with here in this step of finding the c-s? Its letter is S  -- it's the eigenvector matrix.</p> <p>Of course. These are the eigenvectors, there in the columns of our matrix.</p> <p>So  this is S c equals u of zero -- is the -- that step where you find the  actual coefficients, you find out how much of each pure exponential is  in the solution.</p> <p>By getting it right at the start, then it stays  right forever. I -- you're seeing this picture that each -- each pure  exponential goes on its own way once you start it from u of zero.</p> <p>So you start it by figuring out how much each one is present in u of zero and then off they go.</p> <p>Okay.  So -- so that's a system of two equations in two unknowns coupled --  the matrix sort of couples u1 and u2 and the eigenvalues and  eigenvectors uncouple it, diagonalize it. Actually -- okay, now can I --  can I think in terms of S and lambda? So I want to write the solution  down, again in terms of S and lambda. Okay.</p> <p>I'll do that on this far board. Okay.</p> <p>So I'm coming back to -- I'm coming back to our equation du/dt equals Au. Now this matrix A couples them.</p> <p>The whole point of eigenvectors is to uncouple.</p> <p>So  one way to see that is introduce set u equal A -- not A. It's S, the  eigenvector matrix that uncouples it. So I'm -- I'm taking this equation  as I'm given, coupled with -- with A has -- is probably full of  non-zeroes, but I'm -- by uncoupling it, I mean I'm diagonalizing it.</p> <p>If I can get a diagonal matrix, I'm -- I'm in.</p> <p>Okay. So I plug that in.</p> <p>This is A S v. And this is S dv/dt.</p> <p>S is a constant. It's -- this it the eigenvector matrix. This is the eigenvector matrix.</p> <p>Okay.  Now I'm going to bring S inverse over here. And what have I got? That  combination S inverse A S is lambda, the diagonal matrix.</p> <p>That's  -- that's the point, that in -- if I'm using the eigenvectors as my  basis, then my system of equations is just diagonal. I -- each --  there's no coupling anymore -- dv1/dt is lambda one v1.</p> <p>So let's  just write that down. dv1/ dt is lambda one v1 and so on for all n of  the equations. It's a system of equations but they're not connected, so  they're easy to solve and why don't I just write down the solution? v --  well, v is now some e to the lambda one t -- well, okay -- I guess my  idea here now is to use, the natural notation -- v of T is e to the  lambda tv of zero. And u of t will be Se to the lambda t S inverse, u of  zero.</p> <p>This is the -- this is the, formula I'm headed for.</p> <p>This  -- this matrix, S e to the lambda t S inverse, that's my exponential.  That's my e to the A t, is this S e to the lambda t S inverse. So my --  my job really now is to explain what's going on with this matrix up in  the exponential.</p> <p>What does that mean? What does it mean to say e  to a matrix? This ought to be easier because this is e to a diagonal  matrix, but still it's a matrix. What do we mean by e to the A t?  Because really e to the A t is my answer here. My -- my answer to this  equation is -- this u of t, this is my -- this is my e to the A t u of  zero. So it's -- my job is really now to say what's -- what does that  mean? What's the exponential of a matrix and why is that formula  correct? Okay. So I'll put that on the board underneath. What's the  exponential of a matrix? Let me come back here.</p> <p>So I'm talking about matrix exponentials.</p> <p>e to the At. Okay.</p> <p>How  are we going to define the exponential of a -- of something? The trick  -- the idea is -- the thing to go back to is exponential -- there's a  power series for exponentials. That's how you -- you -- the good way to  define e to the x is the power series one plus x plus one half x  squared, one six x cubed and we'll do it now when the -- when we have a  matrix. So the one becomes the identity, the x is At, the x squared is  At squared and I divide by two. The cube, the x cube is At cubed over  six, and what's the general term in here? At to the n-th power divided  by -- and it goes on.</p> <p>But what do I divide by? So, you see the  pattern -- here I divided by one, here I divided by one by two by six,  those are the factorials. It's n factorial.</p> <p>That was, like, the  one beautiful Taylor series. The one beautiful Taylor series -- well,  there are two -- there are two beautiful Taylor series in this world.  The Taylor series for e to the x is the s with x to the n-th over n  factorial.</p> <p>And all I'm doing is doing the same thing for matrixes.</p> <p>The other beautiful Taylor series is just the sum of x to the n-th not divided by n factorial.</p> <p>Can  you -- do you know what function that one is? So if I take -- this is  the series, all these sums are going from zero to infinity. What's --  what function have I got -- this is like a side comment -- this is one  plus x plus x squared plus x cubed plus x to the fourth not divided by  anything, what's -- what's that function? One plus x plus x squared plus  x cubed plus x fourth forever is one over one minus x.</p> <p>It's the geometric series, the nicest power series of all.</p> <p>So,  actually, of course, there would be a similar thing here. If -- if I  wanted, I minus A t inverse would be -- now I've got matrixes.</p> <p>I've got matrixes everywhere, but it's just like that series with -- and just like this one without the divisions.</p> <p>It's I plus At plus At squared plus At cubed and forever.</p> <p>So  that's actually a -- a reasonable way to find the inverse of a matrix.  If I chop it off -- well, it's reasonable if t is small. If t is a small  number, then -- then t squared is extremely small, t cubed is even  smaller, so approximately that inverse is I plus At. I can keep more  terms if I like. Do you see what I'm doing? I'm just saying we can do  the same thing for matrixes that we do for ordinary functions and the  good thing about the exponential series -- so in a way, this series is  better than this one. Why? Because this one always converges.</p> <p>I'm  dividing by these bigger and bigger numbers, so whatever matrix A and  however large t is, that series -- these terms go to zero.</p> <p>The series adds up to a finite sum, e to the At is a -- is -- is completely defined.</p> <p>Whereas  this second guy could fail, right? If At is big -- somehow if At has an  eigenvalue larger than one, then when I square it it'll have that  eigenvalue squared, when I cube it the eigenvalue will be cubed -- that  series will blow up unless the eigenvalues of At are smaller than one.  So when the eigenvalues of At are smaller than one -- so I'd better put  that in. The -- all eigenvalues of At below one -- then that series  converges and gives me the inverse.</p> <p>Okay. So this is the guy I'm  chiefly interested in, and I wanted to connect it to -- oh, okay. What's  -- how do I -- how do I get -- this is my, like, main thing now to do  -- how do I get e to the At -- how do I see that e to the At is the same  as this? In other words, I can find e to the At by finding S and  lambda, because now e to the lambda t is easy.</p> <p>Lambda's a diagonal matrix and we can write down either the lambda t -- and will right -- in a minute.</p> <p>But  how -- do you see what -- do you see that we're hoping for a -- we're  hoping that we can compute either the A T from S and lambda -- and I  have to look at that definition and say, okay, how do -- how do I get an  S and the lambda to come out of that? Okay, can -- do you see how I -- I  want to connect that to that, from that definition. So let me erase  this -- the geometric series, which isn't part of the differential  equations case and get the S and the lambda into this picture. Oh, okay.</p> <p>Here we go. So identity is fine.</p> <p>Now  -- all right, you -- you -- you'll see how I'm -- how I'm -- how I  going to get A replaced by S and S is in lambda's? Well I use the  fundamental formula of this whole chapter. A is S lambda S inverse and  then times t. That's At.</p> <p>Okay. What's A squared t? I can -- I've  got the divide by two, I've got the t squared and I've got an A squared.  All right, I -- so I've got a -- there's A -- there's A. Now square it.</p> <p>So  what happens when I square it? We've seen that before. When I square  it, I get S lambda squared S inverse, right? When I square that thing,  the -- there's an S and a -- an S cancels out an S inverse. I'm left  with the S on the left, the S inverse on the right and lambda squared in  the middle. And so on.</p> <p>The next one'll be S lambda cubed, S  inverse -- times t cubed over three factorial. And now -- what do I do  now? I want to pull an S out from everything.</p> <p>I want an S out of the whole thing.</p> <p>Well,  look, I'd better write the identity how? I -- I want to be able to pull  an S out and an S inverse out from the other side, so I just write the  identity as S times S inverse.</p> <p>So I have an S there and an S  inverse from this side and what have I got in the middle? If I pull out  an S and an S inverse, what have I got in the middle? I've got the  identity, a lambda t, a lambda squared t squared over two -- I've got e  to the lambda t.</p> <p>That's what's in the middle. That's my formula for e to the At. Oh, now I have to ask you.</p> <p>Does this formula always work? This formula always works -- well, except it's an infinite series.</p> <p>But  what do I mean by always work? And this one doesn't always work and I  just have to remind you of what assumption is built into this formula  that's not built into the original. The assumption that A can be  diagonalized. You'll remember that there are some small -- sm- some  subset of matrixes that don't have n independent eigenvectors, so we  don't have an S inverse for those matrixes and the whole diagonalization  breaks down.</p> <p>We could still make it triangular.</p> <p>I'll tell  you about that. But diagonal we can't do for those particular  degenerate matrixes that don't have enough independent eigenvectors. But  otherwise, this is golden. Okay. So that's the formula -- that's the  matrix exponential.</p> <p>Now it just remains for me to say what is e  to the lambda t? Can I just do that? Let me just put that in the corner  here. What is the exponential of a diagonal matrix? Remember lambda is  diagonal, lambda one down to lambda n. What's the exponential of that  diagonal matrix? Because our whole point is that this ought to be  simple. Our whole point is that to take the exponential of a diagonal  matrix ought to be completely decoupled -- it ought to be diagonal, in  other words, and it is. It's just e to the lambda one t, e to the lambda  two t, e to the lambda n t, all zeroes.</p> <p>So -- so if we have a  diagonal matrix and I plug it into this exponential formula,  everything's diagonal and the diagonal terms are just the ordinary  scaler exponentials e to the lambda one t. Okay, so that's -- that's --  in a sense, I'm doing here, on this board, with -- with, like, formulas  what I did on the -- in the first half of the lecture with specific  matrix A and specific eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The -- so let me  show you the formulas again. But the -- so you -- I guess -- what should  you know from this lecture? You should know what this matrix  exponential is and, like, when does it go to zero? Tell me again, now,  the answer to that.</p> <p>When does e to the At approach -- get smaller  and smaller as t increases? Well, the S and the S inverse aren't  moving. It's this one that has to get smaller and smaller and that one  has this simple diagonal form.</p> <p>And it goes to zero provided every  one of these lambdas -- I -- I need to have each one of these guys go  to zero, so I need every real part of every eigenvalue negative. Right?  If the real part is negative, that's -- that takes the exponential --  that forces -- the exponential goes to zero.</p> <p>Okay, so that -- that's really the difference.</p> <p>If I can just draw the -- here's a picture of the -- of the -- this is the complex plain.</p> <p>Here's  the real axis and here's the imaginary axis. And where do the  eigenvalues have to be for stability in differential equations? They  have to be over here, in the left half plain. So the left half plain is  this plain, real part of lambda, less than zero. Where do the ma- where  do the eigenvalues have to be for powers of the matrix to go to zero?  Powers of the matrix go to zero if the eigenvalues are in here.</p> <p>So  this is the stability region for powers -- this is the region --  absolute value of lambda, less than one. That's the stability for --  that tells us that the powers of A go to zero, this tells us that the  exponential of A goes to zero.</p> <p>Okay. One final example.</p> <p>Let me just write down how to deal with a final example.</p> <p>Let's see. So my final example will be a single equation, u''+bu'+Ku=0.</p> <p>One equation, second order.</p> <p>How  do I -- and maybe I should have used -- I'll use -- I prefer to use y  here, because that's what you see in differential equations. And I want u  to be a vector. So how do I change one second order equation into a two  by two first order system? Just the way I did for Fibonacci. I'll let u  be y prime and y.</p> <p>What I'm going to do is I'm going to add an  extra equation, y prime equals y prime. So I take this -- so by -- so  using this as the vector unknown, now my equation is u prime. My first  order system is u prime, that'll be y double prime y prime, the  derivative of u, okay, now the differential equation is telling me that y  double prime is m- so I'm just looking for -- what's this matrix? y  prime y. I'm looking for the matrix A. What's the matrix in case I have a  single first order equation and I want to make it into a two by two  system? Okay, simple.</p> <p>The first row of the matrix is given by the equation.</p> <p>So y''-by'-ky -- no problem.</p> <p>And  what's the second row on the matrix? Then we're done. The second row of  the matrix I want just to be the trivial equation y prime equals y  prime, so I need a one and a zero there.</p> <p>So matrixes like these,  the gen- the general case, if I had a five by five -- if I had a fifth  order equation and I wanted a five by five matrix, I would see the  coefficients of the equation up there and then my four trivial equations  would put ones here. This is the kind of matrix that goes from a fifth  order to a five by five first order.</p> <p>So the -- and the  eigenvalues will come out in a natural way connected to the differential  equation. Okay, that's differential equations. The -- a parallel  lecture compared to powers of a matrix we can now do exponentials.</p> <p>Thanks.</p>
