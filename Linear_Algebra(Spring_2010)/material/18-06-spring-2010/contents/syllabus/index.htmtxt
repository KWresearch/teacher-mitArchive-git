***** Course Meeting Times *****
Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session
Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session
***** Prerequisites *****
Multivariable Calculus (18.02)
***** Text *****
[Amazon_logo] Strang, Gilbert. Introduction_to_Linear_Algebra. 4th ed.
Wellesley, MA: Wellesley-Cambridge_Press, February 2009. ISBN: 9780980232714.
***** Goals *****
The goals for 18.06 are using matrices and also understanding them.
Here are key computations and some of the ideas behind them:
   1. Solving Ax = b for square systems by elimination (pivots, multipliers,
      back substitution, invertibility of A, factorization into A = LU)
   2. Complete solution to Ax = b (column space containing b, rank of A,
      nullspace of A and special solutions to Ax = 0 from row reduced R)
   3. Basis and dimension (bases for the four fundamental subspaces)
   4. Least squares solutions (closest line by understanding projections)
   5. Orthogonalization by Gram-Schmidt (factorization into A = QR)
   6. Properties of determinants (leading to the cofactor formula and the sum
      over all n! permutations, applications to inv(A) and volume)
   7. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors (diagonalizing A, computing powers A^k and
      matrix exponentials to solve difference and differential equations)
   8. Symmetric matrices and positive definite matrices (real eigenvalues and
      orthogonal eigenvectors, tests for x'Ax > 0, applications)
   9. Linear transformations and change of basis (connected to the Singular
      Value Decomposition - orthonormal bases that diagonalize A)
  10. Linear algebra in engineering (graphs and networks, Markov matrices,
      Fourier matrix, Fast Fourier Transform, linear programming)
***** Homework *****
The homeworks are essential in learning linear algebra. They are not a test and
you are encouraged to talk to other students about difficult problems-after you
have found them difficult. Talking about linear algebra is healthy. But you
must write your own solutions.
***** Exams *****
There will be three one-hour exams at class times and a final exam. The use of
calculators or notes is not permitted during the exams.
***** Grading *****
       Grading criteria.
ACTIVITIES           PERCENTAGES
Problem sets         15%
Three one-hour exams 45%
Final exam           40%
***** MATLABÂ® *****
Some homework problems will require you to use MATLAB, an important tool for
numerical linear algebra. No previous MATLAB experience is required in 18.06.
The related_resources section has links to information about MATLAB, including
a tutorial.
