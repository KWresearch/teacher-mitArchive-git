The  partial  derivatives  are

Thus, AT Ax = AT b yields the equations 4C + 8D = 36,  8C + 26D = 112.  Multiply­
ing by 2 and  looking back, we  see  that  these are precisely  the equations ∂E /∂C  = 0

Thus,  solving  AT Ax = AT b,  we  arrive  at

Note 

A = 

C  = 0, C + D + E  = 8, C + 3D + 9E  = 8, C + 4D + 16E  = 20. 

Take  the  sum  of  the  fourth  equation  and  twice  the  second  equation  and  subtract

the  sum  of  the  ﬁrst  equation  and  two  times  the  third  equation.  One  gets  0  =  20.

Hence,  these  equations  are  not  simultaneously  solvable.

The analogue of diagram 4.9(b) in this case would show three vectors a1  = (1, 1, 1, 1), 
a2  = (0, 1, 3, 4), a3  = (0, 1, 9, 16) spanning a three dimensional vector subspace of R4 . 
It would also show the vector b = (0, 8, 8, 20), and the pro jection p = C a1+Da2+E a3 
of  b  into  the  three  dimensional  subspace.

b  =  (0, 1, 3, 4)  at  the  corners  (1, 0)  and  (0, 1)  and  (−1, 0)  and  (0, −1)  of  a  square. 
The  equations  C  + Dx + E y  =  b  at  those  4  points  are  Ax  =  b  with  3  unknowns 
x = (C, D, E ).  What is A?  At the center (0, 0) of the square, show that C +Dx+E y

Computing,  we  ﬁnd  that  the  ﬁrst  entry  of  AT (Ax −  b)  is  4C  −  8.  This  is  zero 
when  C  =  2,  the  average  of  the  entries  of  b.  Plugging  in  the  point  (0, 0),  we  get 
C + D(0) + E (0) = C  = 2  as  desired. 

Section  4.3.  Problem  29:  Usually  there  will  be  exactly  one  hyperplane  in  Rn 
(Example  for  n=3:  There  will 
that  contains  the  n  given  points  x = 0, a1 , . . . , an−1 . 
be  exactly  one  plane  containing  0, a1 , a2  unless 
.)  What  is  the  test  to  have 
exactly  one  hyperplane  in  Rn? 

Solution  (12  points) 
The  sentence  in  paranthesis  can  be  completed  a  couple  of  diﬀerent  ways.  One 
could  write  “There  will  be  exactly  one  plane  containing  0, a1 , a2  unless  these  three 
points are  colinear”.  Another acceptable answer  is “There will be  exactly one plane 
containing  0, a1 , a2  unless  the  vectors  a1  and  a2  are  linearly  dependent”. 

In  general,  0, a1 , . . . , an−1  will  be  contained  in  an  unique  hyperplane  unless  all 
of  the  points  0, a1 , . . . , an−1  are  contained  in  an  n − 2  dimensional  subspace.  Said 
another  way,  0, a1 , . . . , an−1  will  be  contained  in  an  unique  hyperplane  unless  the 
vectors  a1 , . . . , an−1  are  linearly  dependent. 

Section  4.4.  Problem  10:  Orthonormal  vectors  are  automatically  linearly  inde­
pendent. 
(a)  Vector  proof:  When  c1q1  + c2q2  + c3q3  =  0,  what  dot  product  leads  to  c1  =  0? 
Similarly  c2  = 0  and  c3  = 0.  Thus,  the  q ’s  are  independent. 
(b)  Matrix  proof:  Show  that  Qx =  0  leads  to  x =  0.  Since  Q  may  be  rectangular, 
you  can  use QT  but  not Q−1 .

Solution  (4  points)  For  part  (a):  Dotting  the  expression  c1q1  + c2q2  + c3q3  with 
· 
·
· 
q1 ,  we  get  c1  =  0  since  q1  q1  =  1,  q1  q2  =  q1  q3  =  0.  Similarly,  dotting  the 
expression  with  q2  yields  c2  =  0  and  dotting  the  expression  with  q3  yields  c3  =  0. 
Thus,  {q1 , q2 , q3}  is  a  linearly  independent  set. 

For  part  (b):  Let  Q  be  the  matrix  whose  columns  are  q1 , q2 , q3 .  Since  Q  has 
orthonormal  columns, QT Q  is  the  three  by  three  identity matrix.  Now, multiplying 
the  equation Qx = 0  on  the  left by QT  yields x = 0.  Thus,  the nullspace  of Q  is  the 
zero  vector  and  its  columns  are  linearly  independent.

Section  4.4.  Problem  18:  Find  the  orthonormal  vectors  A, B , C  by  Gram-
Schmidt  from  a, b, c: 
a = (1, −1, 0, 0)  b = (0, 1, −1, 0)  c = (0, 0, 1, −1).

Note  that  {a, b, c}  is  a  linearly  independent  set.  Indeed, 
x1a + x2 b + x3c = (x1 , x2  − x1 , x3  − x2 , −x3 ) = (0, 0, 0, 0) 
·
·
·
implies that x1  = x2  = x3  = 0.  We check a (1, 1, 1, 1) = b (1, 1, 1, 1) = c (1, 1, 1, 1) = 
0.  Hence, all three vectors are in the nullspace of (1, 1, 1, 1).  Moreover, the dimension 
of  the  column  space  of  the  transpose  and  the dimension  of  the nullspace  sum  to  the 
dimension  of  R4 .  Thus,  the  space  of  vectors  perpendicular  to  (1, 1, 1, 1)  is  three 
dimensional.  Since  {a, b, c}  is  a  linearly  independent  set  in  this  space,  it  is  a  basis.

Since  {A, B , C }  is  an  orthonormal  set,  it  is  a  linearly  independent  set  by  problem 
10.  Thus,  it  must  also  span  the  space  of  vectors  perpendicular  to  (1, 1, 1, 1),  and  it 
is  also  a  basis  of  this  space. 

Section 4.4.  Problem 35:  Factor [Q, R] = qr(A) for A = eye(4)−diag([111], −1). 
You  are  orthogonalizing  the  columns  (1, −1, 0, 0),  (0, 1, −1, 0),  (0, 0, 1, −1),  and 
(0, 0, 0, 1)  of  A.  Can  you  scale  the  orthogonal  columns  of  Q  to  get  nice  integer 
components?

The  n  columns  of Q1  are  an  orthonormal  basis  for  which  fundamental  subspace? 
The m − n columns of Q2  are an orthonormal basis for which fundamental subspace? 

Solution  (12 points) The n columns of Q1  form an orthonormal basis for the column 
space of A.  The m−n columns of Q2  form an orthonormal basis for the left nullspace 
of  A. 

Section  5.1.  Problem  10:  If  the  entries  in  every  row  of  A  add  to  zero,  solve 
Ax =  0  to  prove  det A =  0.  If  those  entries  add  to  one,  show  that  det(A − I ) =  0. 
Does  this mean  det A = I ? 

Solution  (4 points)  If x = (1, 1, . . . , 1),  then  the  components  of Ax  are  the  sums  of 
the  rows  of  A.  Thus,  Ax  =  0.  Since  A  has  non-zero  nullspace,  it  is  not  invertible 
and det A = 0.  If  the  entries  in  every  row of A  sum  to one,  then  the  entries  in  every 
row of A − I  sum to zero.  Hence, A − I  has a non-zero nullspace and det(A − I ) = 0.

Hilbert matrices  are  hard  to  work  with!  What  are  the  pivots  of  hilb(5)? 

Solution  (12  points)  Here  is  the  relevant matlab  code. 

Note  that the determinants of the 4th through 10th Hilbert matrices diﬀer  from 
zero  by  less  than  one  ten  thousandth.  The  pivots  of  the  ﬁfth  Hilbert  matrix  are 
1, .0833, −.0056, .0007, .0000  up  to  four  signiﬁcant  ﬁgures.  Thus,  we  see  that  there 
is  even  a pivot  of  the ﬁfth Hilbert matrix  that diﬀers  from  zero by  less  than  one  ten 
thousandth.

“Inf ” mean  in MATLAB?) 

Solution  (12  points)  This matlab  code  computes  some  examples  for  rand. 

As  you  can  see,  rand(50)  is  around  105 ,  rand(100)  is  around  1025 ,  rand(200)  is

around  1079 ,  and  rand(400)  is  around  10219 .
