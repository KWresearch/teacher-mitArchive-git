Section  1.2.  Problem  23:  The  ﬁgure  shows  that  cos(α) =  v1/�v�  and  sin(α) = 
v2/�v�.  Similarly  cos(β )  is 
.  The  angle  θ  is  β  − α. 
and  sin(β )  is 
Substitute into the trigonometry formula cos(α) cos(β ) + sin(β ) sin(α) for cos(β − α) 
to  ﬁnd  cos(θ) = v  w/�v��w�.

Solution  (4  points) 
First  blank:  w1/�w�.  Second  blank:  w2/�w�.  Substituting  into  the  trigonome­
try  formula  yields 
cos(β − α) = (w1/�w�)(v1/�v�) + (w2/�w�)(v2/�v�) = v  w/�v��w�.

x2  = b1 ,  −x1  + x3  = b2 ,  −x2  + x4  = b3 ,  −x3  + x5  = b4 ,  −x4  = b5 . 

Observe  that  the  sum  of  the  ﬁrst,  third,  and  ﬁfth  equations  is  zero.  Similarly, 
b1  + b3  + b5  = 0.

Section  2.1.  Problem  30:  Continue  Problem  29  from  u0  =  (1, 0)  to  u7 ,  and  also 
from v0  = (0, 1) to v7 .  What do you notice about u7  and v7?  Here are two MATLAB 
codes,  with  while  and  for.  They  plot  u0  to  u7  and  v0  to  v7 . 
The  u’s  and  the  v ’s  are  approaching  a  steady  state  vector  s.  Guess  that  vector  and

Section  2.2.  Problem  20:  Three  planes  can  fail  to  have  an  intersection  point,

even  if  no  planes  are  parallel.  The  system  is  singular  if  row  3  of  A  is  a

of  the  ﬁrst  two  rows.  Find  a  third  equation  that  can’t  be  solved  together  with

x + y + z = 0  and  x − 2y − z = 1.


Solution
 (4  points) 
The  system  is  singular  if  row  3  of A  is  a  linear  combination  of  the  ﬁrst  two  rows. 
There  are many  possible  choices  of  a  third  equation  that  cannot  be  solved  together 
with  the  ones  given.  An  example  is  2x + 5y + 4z  = 1.  Note  that  the  left  hand  side 
of  the  third  equation  is  the  three  times  the  left hand  side  of  thte ﬁrst minus  the  left 
hand  side  of  the  second.  However,  the  right hand  side does not  satisfy  this  relation. 

Section  2.2.  Problem  32:  Start  with  100  equations  Ax  =  0  for  100  unknowns 
x = (x1 , . . . , x100 ).  Suppose  elimination  reduces  the  100th  equation  to  0 = 0,  so  the 
system  is  “singular”. 
(a)  Elimination  takes  linear  combinations  of  the  rows.  So  this  singular  system  has 
the  singular  property:  Some  linear  combination  of  the  100  rows  is 
. 
(b)  Singular  systems  Ax = 0  have  inﬁnitely many  solutions.  This means  that  some 
linear  combination  of  the  100  columns  is 
. 
(c)  Invent  a  100  by  100  singular matrix  with  no  zero  entries. 
(d)  For  your  matrix,  describe  in  words  the  row  picture  and  the  column  picture  of 
Ax = 0.  Not  necessary  to  draw  100-dimensional  space. 

Solution  (12  points) 
(a)  Zero.  (b)  Zero.  (c)  There  are  many  possible  answers.  For  instance,  the  matrix 
· · · 
for  which  every  row  is  (1  2  3 
100).  (d)  The  row  picture  is  100  copies  of  the 
hyperplane  in  100-space  deﬁned  by  the  equation 
· · · 
x1  + 2x2  + 3x3  +  + 100x100  = 0.

The  column  picture  is  the  100  vectors  proportional  to  (1  1  1

If  the  three  solutions  x1 ,  x2 ,  x3  are  the  columns  of  a matrix X , what  is A  times X ? 

Ax1  =

Solution  (4  points) 
The matrix  AX  has  columns  Ax1 ,  Ax2 ,  and  Ax3 .  Therefore,  AX  = I . 

Section  2.4.  Problem  36:  Suppose  A  is  m  by  n,  B  is  n  by  p,  and  C  is  p  by  q . 
Then  the  multiplication  count  for  (AB )C  is  mnp + mpq .  The  multiplication  count 
from  A  times  BC  with mnq + npq  separate multiplications. 
(a)  If  A  is  2  by  4,  B  is  4  by  7,  and  C  is  7  by  10,  do  you  prefer  (AB )C  or  A(BC )? 
(b) With N -component  vectors,  would  you  choose  (uT v)wT  or  uT (vwT )? 
(c)  Divide  by mnpq  to  show  that  (AB )C  is  faster  when  n−1  + q−1  < m−1  + p−1 . 

Solution  (12  points) 
·
· 
·
· 
(a)  Note  that  (AB )C  has  2  4  7 + 2  7  10 =  196  multiplications  and  A(BC )  has 
·
· 
·
· 
2  4  10 + 4  7  10 = 360. Hence, we prefer (AB )C .
(b)  We  prefer  (uT v)wT ;  it  requires  2N  multiplications.  On  the  other  hand,  the 
multiplication  count  for  uT (vwT )  is  2N 2 . 
(c)  Note  (AB )C  is  faster  when  mnp + mpq  <  mnq + npq .  Dividing  by  mnpq ,  we 
get  q−1  + n−1  < p−1  + m−1 . 

Section  2.5.  Problem  7:  If  A  has row 1  + row 2  = row 3,  show  that  A  is  not 
invertible: 
(a)  Explain  why  Ax = (1, 0, 0)  cannot  have  a  solution. 
(b) Which  right  sides  (b1 , b2 , b3 ) might  allow  a  solution  to  Ax = b? 
(c) What  happens  to  row  3  in  elimination? 

7 

Solution  (4  points) 
(a)  Suppose  A  has  row  vectors  A1 ,  A2 ,  A3 ,  and  x  is  a  solution  to  Ax  =  (1, 0, 0). 
·
· 
· 
Then  A1  x  =  1,  A2  x  =  0,  and  A3  x  =  0.  But  A1  + A2  =  A3  means  that 
A1  · x + A2  · x = A3  · x  and  1 + 0 = 0,  a  contradiction. 
(b)  If Ax = (b1 , b2 , b3 ),  then A1 · x = b1 , A2 · x = b2 , A3 · x = b3 .  Since A1 + A2  = A3 , 
we  deduce  b1  + b2  = b3 . 
(c)  In  the  eliminated matrix,  the  third  row  will  be  zero.
