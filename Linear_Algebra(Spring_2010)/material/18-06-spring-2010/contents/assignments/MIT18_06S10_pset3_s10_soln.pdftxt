Problem  1.  (§3.2, #18)  The plane  x − 3y − z  =  12  is  parallel  to  the  plane  x − 3y − z  = 0 in Problem 
17.  One particular point on this plane is (12, 0, 0).  All points on the plane have the form (ﬁll in the  ﬁrst 
components)

Problem  2.  (§3.2,  #24)  (If  possible.  .  . )  Construct  a  matrix  whose  column  space  contains  (1, 1, 0)  and 
(0, 1, 1)  and  whose  nullspace  contains (1, 0, 1)  and (0, 0, 1). 

Solution.  (4  points)  Not  possible  :  Such  a  matrix  A  must be 3  × 3.  Since  the  nullspace  is  supposed  to 
contain two independent vectors,  A can have at  most 3 − 2  = 1 pivots.  Since the column space is supposed  to 
contain  two  independent  vectors,  A  must  have  at  least  2  pivots.  These  conditions  cannot  both  be  met!  � 

Problem  3.  (§3.2,  #36)  How  is  the  nullspace  N(C ) related  to  the  spaces  N(A) and  N(B ), if C  =

A 
(cid:20)  (cid:21) 
B 

? 

Solution.  (12  points)  N(C ) =  N(A) ∩ N(B ) 

just  the  intersection:  Indeed, 
Ax 
(cid:20) 
(cid:21) 
Bx 
so that  C x =  0  if  and  only  if  Ax =  0  and  Bx =  0.  (...and as  a  nitpick,  it  wouldn’t  be  quite  sloppy  instead 
write  “if  and  only if  Ax =  Bx = 0”—those are zero vectors of potentially diﬀerent length, hardly  equal).  � 

C x = 

Problem  4.  (§3.2, #37) Kirchoﬀ ’s Law says that  current  in  =  current  out  at every  node.  This network has 
six  currents  y1 , . . . , y6  (the  arrows  show  the  positive  direction,  each yi  could  be  positive  or  negative).  Find 
the four equations  Ay = 0 for Kirchoﬀ ’s Law at the four  nodes.  Find  three  special  solutions in the  nullspace 
of  A. 

Solution.  (12  points)  The  four  equations  are,  in  order  by  node, 
y1  − y3  +  y4  = 0 
−y1  +  y2  +  y5  = 0 
−y2  +  y3  +  y6  = 0 
−y4  − y5  − y6  = 0

Adding  the  last  three  rows  to  the  ﬁrst  eliminates  it,  and  shows  that  we  have  three  “pivot  variables” 
y1 , y2 , y4  and  three  “free  variables”  y3 , y5 , y6 . 
We  ﬁnd  the  special  solutions  by  back-substitution  from 
(y3 , y5 , y6 ) = (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1):

Problem  5.  (§3.3, #19)  Suppose  A  and  B  are  n  by  n  matrices,  and  AB  =  I .  Prove  from  rank(AB )  ≤
rank(A)  that  the  rank  of  A  is  n.  So  A  is  invertible  and  B  must  be  its  two-sided  inverse  (Section  2.5). 
Therefore  BA =  I  (which  is  not  so  obvious!). 

� 

Solution.  (4  points)  Since  A  is  n  by  n,  rank(A) ≤ n  and  conversely 
n = rank(In ) =  rank(AB ) ≤ rank(A). 
The  rest  of  the  problem  statement  seems  to  be  “commentary,”  and  not  further  things  to  do.

Problem  6.  (§3.3,  #25)  Neat  fact  Every  m  by  n  matrix  of  rank  r  reduces  to  (m  by  r)  times 
(r  by  n): 
A = (pivot  columns  of A) (ﬁrst r  rows  of  R)) = (COL) (ROW) . 
Write  the  3  by  4  matrix  A  in  equation (1)  at  the  start  of  this  section  as  the product  of  the 3 by 2  matrix 
from  the  pivot  columns  and  the  2  by  4  matrix  from  R.

(a)  What  are  the  shapes  of  those  four  blocks? 
(b)  Find  a  right-inverse  B  with  RB =  I  if  r =  m. 
(c)  Find  a  left-inverse  C  with  CR =  I  if  r =  n. 
(d)  What  is  the  reduced  row  echelon  form  of  RT  (with shapes)? 
(e)  What  is  the  reduced  row  echelon  form  of  RT R  (with shapes)? 
Prove that  RT R  has  the  same  nullspace  as  R.  Later  we  show  that  AT A  always  has  the  same  nullspace  as  A 
(a  valuable  fact).

Problem  8.  (§3.3,  #28)  Suppose  you  allow  elementary  column  operations  on  A  as  well  as  elementary  row

operations (which get to  R).  What  is  the  “row-and-column  reduced  form”  for  an  m  by  n matrix  of  rank  r?


Solution.  (12  points) After getting  to  R  we  can  use  the  column  operations  to  get  rid  of  F ,  and  get  to

Problem  9.  (§3.3,  #17  –  Optional) 
(a)  Suppose  column  j  of  B  is  a  combination  of  previous  columns  of  B .  Show  that  column  j  of  AB  is 
the  same  combination  of  previous  columnd  of  AB .  Then  AB  cannot  have  new  pivot  columns,  so 
rank(AB ) ≤ rank(B ). 
(b)  Find  A1  and  A2  so  that  rank(A1B ) = 1  and  rank(A2B ) = 0 for  B =

Solution.  (Optional) 
(a)  That  column  j  of  B  is  a  combination  of  previous  columns  of  B  means  precisely  that  there  exist 
numbers  a1 , . . . , aj−1  so  that  each  row  vector  x = (xi ) of  B  satisﬁes  the  linear  relation 
j−1 
X 
· · · 
i=1 
The  rows  of  the  matrix  AB  are  all  linear  combinations  of  the  rows  of  B ,  and  so  also  satisfy  this 
linear  relation.  So,  column  j  is the  same  combination of previous columns of  AB ,  as  desired.  Since  a 
column  is  pivot  column  precisely  when  it  is  not  a  combination  of  previous  columns,  this  shows  that 
AB  cannot  have  previous  columns  and  the  rank  inequality.

Problem  10.  (§3.4,  #13)  Explain  why  these  are  all  false: 
(a)  The  complete  solution  is  any  linear  combination  of  xp  and  xn . 
(b)  A  system  Ax =  b  has  at  most  one  particular  solution. 
(c)  The  solution  xp  with  all free  variables  zero is the  shortest  solution (minimum length  kxk).  Find  a 2 
by  2  counterexample. 
(d)  If  A  is  invertible  there  is  no  solution  xn  in  the  nullspace.

Solution.  (4  points) 
(a)  The  coeﬃcient  of  xp  must  be  one. 
(b)  If  xn  N(A)  is  in  the  nullspace  of  A  and  xp  is  one  particular  solution,  then  xp  +  xn  is  also  a 
∈
particular  solution. 
(c)  Lots  of  counterexamples are possible.  Let’s talk  about the 2 by  2  case geometrically: If  A  is  a 2 by  2 
matrix  of  rank  1,  then  the  solutions  to  Ax =  b  form  a  line  parallel  to  the  line  that  is  the  nullspace. 
We’re  asking  that  this  line’s  closest  point  to  the  origin  be  somewhere  not  along  an  axis.  The  line 
x +  y = 1  gives  such  an  example.

Problem  11.  (§3.4,  #25)  Write  down  all  known  relations  between  r  and  m  and  n  if  Ax =  b  has 
(a)  no  solution  for  some  b 
(b)  inﬁnitely  many  solutions  for  every  b 
(c)  exactly  one  solution  for  some  b,  no  solution  for  other  b 
(d)  exactly  one  solution  for  every  b. 

Solution.  (4  points) 
(a)  The  system  has  less  than  full  row  rank:  r < m. 
(b)  The  system  has  full  row  rank,  and  less  than  full  column  rank:  m =  r < n. 
(c)  The  system  has  full  column  rank,  and  less  than  full  row  rank:  n =  r < m. 
(d)  The  system has full  row  and  column  rank (i.e., is invertible):  n =  r =  m.

the points 1, . . . , 9  on  the  x  axis,  I  think  the  nine  points  fall  on  a  parabola.

Problem  14.  (§3.4, #36)  Suppose  Ax =  b  and  C x =  b  have the  same (complete)  solutions for  every  b.  Is 
it true that  A =  C ? 

Solution.  (12  points)  Yes  .  In  order  to  check  that  A =  C  as  matrices,  it’s  enough  to  check  that  Ay =  C y 
for all  vectors  y of  the correct  size (or just for the standard basis vectors, since multiplication by  them  “picks 
out  the  columns”).  So  let  y  be  any  vector  of  the  correct  size,  and  set  b =  Ay.  Then  y  is  certainly  a  solution 
to  Ax =  b,  and  so  by  our  hypothesis  must  also  be  a  solution  to  C x =  b;  in  other  words,  C y =  b =  Ay.  �
