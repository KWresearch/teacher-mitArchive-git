linear  combination  of  the  columns  of  A  (with  the  components  of  x  as  combining  coeﬃcients);  so 
Ax  =  b  is  solvable  exactly  when  b  lies  in  the  column  space,  so  exactly  when  the  column  space 
doesn’t  get  larger. 

Section  3.1.  Problem  30:  Suppose  S  and  T  are  two  subspaces  of  a  vector  space V. 

(a)  Deﬁnition:  The  sum  S + T  contains  all  sums  s + t  of  a  vector  s  in  S  and  a  vector  t  in 
T.  Show  that  S + T  satisﬁes  the  requirements  (addition  and  scalar  multiplication)  for  a 
vector  space. 
(b)  If  S  and  T  are  lines  in Rm ,  what  is  the  diﬀerence  between  S + T  and  S ≤ T?  That  union 
contains  all  vectors  from  S  and  T  or  both.  Explain  this  statement:  The  span  of  S ≤ T  is 
S + T.  (Section  3.5  returns  to  this  word  “span.”) 
Solution  (12  points):  (a)  Let  s, s�  be  vectors  in  S,  let  t, t�  be  vectors  in  T,  and  let  c  be  a  scalar. 
Then 
�  + t
� ) = (s + s
� ) + (t + t
� )  and  c(s + t) = cs + ct. 
(s + t) + (s
Thus  S + T  is  closed  under  addition  and  scalar  multiplication;  in  other  words,  it  satisﬁes  the  two 
requirements  for  a  vector  space. 
(b)  If S and T are distinct  lines,  then S + T  is a plane, whereas S ≤ T  is not even closed under 
addition.  The  span  of S ≤ T  is  the  set  of  all  combinations  of  vectors  in  this  union.  In  particular,  it 
contains  all  sums  s + t  of  a  vector  s  in  S  and  a  vector  t  in T,  and  these  sums  form  S + T.  On  the 
other  hand,  S + T  contains  both  S  and  T;  so  it  contains  S ≤ T.  Further,  S + T  is  a  vector  space. 
So it contains all combinations of vectors in itself;  in particular,  it contains the span of S ≤ T.  Thus 
the  span  of  S ≤ T  is  S + T. 

Section  3.1.  Problem  32:  Show that  the matrices A and  [ A AB ] (with extra columns) have the 
same  column  space.  But  ﬁnd  a  square matrix  with C(A2 )  smaller  than C(A).  Important  point: 
An  n  by  n  matrix  has C(A) = Rn  exactly  when  A  is  an 
matrix. 

Solution  (12  points):  Each  column  of  AB  is  a  combination  of  the  columns  of  A  (the  combining 
coeﬃcients  are  the  entries  in  the  corresponding  column  of  B ).  So  any  combination  of  the  columns 
( 
( 
)
)
of  [ A AB ]  is a  combination of  the  columns of A alone.  Thus A and  [ A AB ] have  the  same  column 
space. 
Let  A = 
.  Then  A2  = 0,  so C(A2 ) = Z.  But  C(A)  is  the  line  through 
.

An  n  by  n  matrix  has  C(A) = Rn  exactly  when  A  is  an  invertible  matrix,  because  Ax =  b  is 
solvable  for  any  given  b  exactly  when  A  is  invertible.
