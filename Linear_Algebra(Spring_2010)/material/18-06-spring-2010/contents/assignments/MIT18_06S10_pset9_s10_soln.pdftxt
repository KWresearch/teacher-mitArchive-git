Solution  (4  points)  Evaluating  out  the  right  side  gives  ax2  + 2bxy + cy 2 ,  so  the 
entry  in  the  space  given  is  c −  a  ,  i.e.  the  second  pivot.  For  the  given  values,  we

H1  is  positive-deﬁnite  so  F1  is  concave  up  (=  convex).  Find  the  minimum  point  of 
F1  and  the  the  saddle  point  of  F2  (look  only  where  the  ﬁrst  derivatives  are  zero).

REMARK:  The  problem  for  F1  = x4/4 + x2y + y 2  as  originally  stated,  you  get 
a  curve  of minima  x2  + 2y = 0,  and H1  is  only  positive  semideﬁnite.

The  eigenvalues  of H2  at  (0, 1)  is  the  solution  to  det  (H2  − λI ) = λ2  − 1,  which  are 
λ1  = 1 and λ2  = −1.  They are with opposite signs and hence (0, 1)  is a saddle point 
of  F2 (x, y). 

Problem  6.5,  #32:  A  group  of  nonsingular  matrices  include  AB  and  A−1  if  it 
includes  A  and  B .  “Products  and  inverses  stay  in  the  group.”  Which  of  these  are 
groups  (as  in  2.7.37)?  Invent  a  “subgroup”  of  two  of  these  groups  (not  I  by  itself = 
the  smallest  group). 
(a)  Positive  deﬁnite  symmetric matrices  A. 
(b)  Orthogonal matrices Q. 
(c)  All  exponentials  etA  of  a  ﬁxed matrix  A. 
(d)  Matrices  P  with  positive  eigenvalues.

matrices ),  though  there  are many  others. 

are  both  positive  deﬁnite  and  symmetric,  but  their  product  is  not 

and 

Problem  6.5,  #33:  When  A  and  B  are  symmetric  positive  deﬁnite,  AB  might 
not  even  be  symmetric.  But  its  eigenvalues  are  still  positive.  Start  from ABx = λx 
and  take  dot  products  with  Bx.  Then  prove  λ > 0. 

Solution  (12  points)  Taking  dot  products,  we  get  (ABx)TBx  = (Bx)TA(Bx)  on 
the  left  and  (λx)TBx = λxTBx.  Since  B  is  positive  deﬁnite,  xTBx >  0,  and  since 
A  is positive deﬁnite,  (Bx)TA(Bx)  is too (Bx  is  just another vector).  Thus, λ must 
be  positive  as  well. 

Problem  6.5,  #34:  Write  down  the  5  by  5  sine  matrix  S  from Worked  Example 
6.5 D, containing  the  eigenvectors of K  when n = 5 and h = 1/6.  Multiply K  times 
S  to  see  the  ﬁve  positive  eigenvalues. 
Their  sum  should  equal  the  trace  10.  Their  product  should  be  det K  = 6.

Problem  6.5,  #35:  If  A  has  full  column  rank,  and  C  is  positive-deﬁnite,  show 
that  ATCA  is  positive  deﬁnite. 
Solution  (12  points)  Since  C  is  positive-deﬁnite,  yTC y  >  0  for  any  y  =�
0  in  Rn . 
Now,  we  need  to  show  that  zTATCAz  >  0  for  any  z  =�
0  in  Rn .  We  can  rewrite 
it  as  zTATCAz  = (Az )TC (Az ).  Since  A  has  full  column  rank,  N (A) =  {0}  and  in 
particular,  Az  �=  0  in  Rn .  Therefore,  we  have  (Az )TC (Az )  >  0.  This  implies  that 
ATCA  is  positive  deﬁnite. 

Problem  8.1,  #3:  In  the  free-free  case  when  ATCA  in  equation  (9)  is  singular, 
add  the  three  equations ATCAu = f  to  show  that we  need  f1 + f2 + f3  = 0.  Find  a 
solution  to  ATCAu = f  when  the  forces  f  = (−1, 0, 1)  balance  themselves.  Find  all 
solutions!
