Clearly det A  =  1:  it  is  the  product  of  two  matrices  that  are  triangular  with  ones  on  the  diagonal,  and  so 
 
each have determinant 1.

These numbers are actually pretty  special: Since  λ2  =  λ − 1, they  satisfy  λ3  =  λ2 − λ  =  −1 and  so  λ6  = 1. 
Since  λ1  =  λ2 , there is a basis  v1 , v2  consisting  of  eigenvectors for  A.  So  to  check  that  A6  =  I , it is enough 
to  check  this  on  the  basis  v1  and  v2 .  But,  A6 v1  = 
λ6

Problem  4.  (§6.3, #29)  The  centered  choice (leapfrog  method )  in  Problem  28  is  very  successful  for  small 
time  steps  Δt.  But  ﬁnd  the  eigenvalues  of  A  for Δt  =  √2  and  2:

Both  matrices  have  |λ| =  1.  Compute  A4  in  both  cases  and  ﬁnd  the  eigenvectors  of  A.  That  value  Δt  = 2 
is  at  the  border  of  instability.  Time  steps  Δt >  2  will  lead  to  λ >  1,  and  the  powers  in  Un  =  AnU0  will 
|
|
explode. 
Note  You might say that  nobody  would  compute with Δt >  2.  But if an atom vibrates with  y  =  −1000000y , 
′′ 
then  Δt >  .0002  will  give  instability.  Leapfrog  has  a  very  strict  stability  limit.  Yn+1  =  Yn  + 3Zn  and 
Zn+1  =  Zn  − 3Yn+1  will  explode  because  Δt  = 3 is too large. 
Solution.  (12  points)  For Δt  =  √2,  the  eigenvalues  are  the  roots  of  λ2  + 1  = 0, that is  ±i  .  For  Δt  = 2, 
the  eigenvalues  are  the  roots  of  λ2  + 2λ + 1  = 0, that is  −1  (with algebraic  multiplicity  two). 
In  the  ﬁrst  case,  A4  =  I  (for  the  same  reason  as in  the previous problem,  or just  multiply it  out).  The 
eigenvectors  of  A  (for i, −i  respectively)  are (multiples  of )

matrix if  BT  =  −B . 
(b)  (Optional  MATHLAB)  Take  32  steps  from  U0  = (1, 0)  to  U32  with Δt  = 2π/32.  Is  U32  =  U0 ? I

that  has  a  negative  eigenvalue. 

Solution.  (4  points) 
(a)  The eigenvalues of  that matrix are 1 ± b. So take any  b >  1 (or  b <  −1).  In this case, the determinant 
is 1 − b2  <  0. 
(b)  We  saw in the book  that the  signs  of  the pivots  coincide  with  the  signs  of  the  eigenvalues.  (Alterna­
tively,  the  product  of  the  pivots  is  the  determinant,  which  is  negative  in  this  case.  So,  precisely  one 
of  the  two  pivots  must  be  negative.) 
(c)  The  product  of  the  eigenvalues  equals  the  determinant,  which  is  negative  in  this  case.  Two  negative 
� 
numbers  cannot have  a  negative product!

is  real. 
xTx 
Find  the  ﬂaw in this reasoning—a hidden assumption that is not justiﬁed.  You could  test those steps on the 
90-degree  rotation  matrix [0, −1; 1, 0]  with  λ  =  i  and  x = (i, 1). 
Solution.  (4 points) The vector x doesn’t have real components.  So, xTx can be zero and  neither numerator

nor  denominator  is  obviously  real.  .  .

Solution.  (4  points) One  at  a  time: 
(a)  Matrix A is invertible, orthogonal, a permutation matrix, diagonalizable, and Markov! (So everything 
but  a  pro jection.  .  . ) 
Let’s  see  why:  A  satisﬁes  A2  =  I  and  A  =  AT ,  and  so  also  AAT  =  I .  This  means  it  is  invertible, 
symmetric,  and  orthogonal.  Since it is  symmetric, it is diagonalizable (with  real  eigenvalues!).  It is 
a permutation  matrix by just looking  at it.  It is Markov since the  columns  add  to 1 (just by  looking 
at it),  or  alternatively because  every permutation  matrix is.  It is  not  a pro jection  since  A2  =  I  =  A. 
All  of  the  factorizations  are  possible  for  it:  LU  and  QR  are  always  possible,  SΛS−1  is possible 
since  it  is  diagonalizable,  and  QΛQT  is  possible  since  it  is  symmetric. 
(b)  Matrix  B  is  a  pro jection,  diagonalizable,  and  Markov.  It  is  not  invertible,  not  orthogonal,  and  not  a 
permutation. 
Let’s  see  why:  B  is  a  pro jection  since  B 2  =  B ,  it  is  symmetric  and  thus  diagonalizable,  and 
it’s  Markov  since  the  columns  add  to  1.  It  is  not  invertible  since  the  columns  are  visibly  linearly 
dependent,  it  is  not  orthogonal  since  the  columns  are  far  from  orthonormal,  and  it’s  clearly  not  a 
permutation. 
All  the factorizations are possible for it:  LU  and  QR are  always possible,  SΛS−1  is possible  since 
it  is  diagonalizable,  and  QΛQT  is  possible  since  it  is  symmetric.

Solution.  (12  points) We  solve  λ2  − 4λ − 5  = 0 to  ﬁnd  λ  =  −1  or  λ  = 5. 
Now let’s do the proof: 
 
x TAx (cid:1)T 
=  x TAT x =  x TAx =  λx T x. 
λx T  x =  (cid:0)
 
But  now,  xTx  is  the  complex  conjugate  of  x T x.  Since  x T x = 
i  |xi |2  is  a  non-negative  real  number,  it  is  its 
P
own  complex  conjugate (and  non-zero).  Dividing  the previous displayed  equation by  this  non-zero  number,

we get  λ  =  λ.

When  eλ1 t  and  eλ2 t  multiply  x1  and  x2 ,  what  is  the  steady  state  as  t  → ∞? 
Solution.  (4  points)  The  eigenvalues  are  the  roots  of  λ2  + 1/2λ,  that  is  0, −1/2  .  This  has  λ  = 0  as  an 
eigenvalue  since  A  has  λ  = 1  as  an  eigenvalue (since it is Markov). 
For  λ1  = 0,  eλ1 tx1  =  x1  is  already  the  steady  state. 
For  λ2  =  −1/2,  eλ2 tx2  =  e−1/2tx2  goes to the  steady  state (0, 0)  as  t  → ∞.

Solution.  (12  points)  The  eigenvalues  are  the  roots  of  λ3  − 6/5λ2  + 1/5λ  = 0,  which  are  0, 1/5, 1 
We  can  ﬁnd  corresponding  eigenvectors: 
•  For  λ  = 0: (1, 1, −2). 
•  For  λ  = 1/5: (1, −1, 0). 
•  For  λ  = 1: (3, 3, 4) (for  λ  = 1). 
(And  in  fact,  we  only care  about  the  last  one  since  the  others  have  λ <  1)

So, limk→∞  Ak  is  a (non-orthogonal)  pro jection  onto the line  spanned by (3, 3, 4).  Since  A  is Markov, 
limk→∞  Ak  is  as  well  and its  columns  are  vectors parallel  to (3, 3, 4)  whose  components  sum  to  1.  This  tells
