Solution  (4  points):  Since  v4  =  v2  − v1 , v5  =  v3  − v1 ,  and  v6  =  v3  − v2 ,  there  are  at  most  three 
independent vectors among these:  furthermore, applying row reduction to the matrix  [v1v2v3 ] gives 
three  pivots,  showing  that  v1 , v2 ,  and  v3  are  independent.

Equating  them  gives  d =  g  =  h = 0, e =  i =  a, f  =  b,  i.e.  the  matrix  with  the  form  above.  Since 
there  are  three  free  variables,  the  subspace  of  these matrices  has  dimension  3. 

Section  3.5.  Problem  41:  Write  a  3  by  3  identity  matrix  as  a  combination  of  the  other  ﬁve 
permutation  matrices.  Then  show  that  those  ﬁve  matrices  are  linearly  indpendent.  (Assume  a

matrices  are  a  basis  for  the  subspace  of  3  by  3 matrices  with  row  and  column  sums  all  equal.

Since P21 + P31 + P32  is  the all 1s matrix and P32P21 + P21P32  is  the matrix with 0s on  the diagonal 
and  1s  elsewhere,  I  =  P21  + P31  + P32  − P32P21  − P21P32 .  For  the  second  part,  the  combination

Setting  each  element  equal  to  0  ﬁrst  gives  c1  = c2  = c3  = 0  along  the  diagonal,  then  c4  = c5  = 0  on 
the  oﬀ-diagonal  entries. 

Section  3.5.  Problem  44:  (An aside  in  the  text,  followed by) dimension  of  outputs  + dimension 
of  nul lspace  =  dimension  of  inputs.  For  an m  by n matrix  of  rank  r , what  are  those  3  dimensions? 
Outputs  =  column  space.  This  question  wil  be  answered  in  Section  3.6,  can  you  do  it  now? 

Solution  (12  points):  You  should  think  about  the  aside  in  the  text,  as  well  as  problem  43:  the 
actual question asked, here, however  is quite simple.  The dimension of  inputs  for an m by n matrix 
is  n  (the  matrix  takes  n-vectors  to  m-vectors),  while  the  dimension  of  the  nullspace  is  n − r  and 
the dimension  of  outputs = dimension  of  column  space  is  r .  Since n − r + r = n, we have  the  given 
relation. 

Section  3.6.  Problem  11:  A  is  an m  by  n matrix  of  rank  r .  Suppose  there  are  right  sides  b  for 
which  Ax = b  has  no  solution. 
(a) What  are  all  the  inequalities  (<  or  ≤)  that  must  be  true  between m,  n,  and  r? 
(b)  How  do  you  know  that  AT y = 0  has  solutions  other  than  y = 0? 

Solution  (4  points):  (a)  The  rank  of  a  matrix  is  always  less  than  or  equal  to  the  number  of  rows 
and  columns,  so  r ≤ m and  r ≤ n.  Moreover, by  the  second  statement,  the  column  space  is  smaller 
than  the  space  of  possible  output  matrices,  i.e.  r < m. 
(b)  These  solutions  make  up  the  left  nullspace,  which  has  dimension m − r > 0  (that  is,  there 
are  nonzero  vectors  in  it). 

Section  3.6.  Problem  24:  AT y = d  is  solvable  when  d  is  in  which  of  the  four  subspaces?  The 
solution  is  unique  when  the 
contains  only  the  zero  vector.

Solution  (4  points):  It  is  solvable  when  d  is  in  the  row  space,  which  consists  of  all  vectors  AT y, 
and  is  unique  when  the  left  nullspace  contains  only  the  zero  vector  (as  any  two  solutions  diﬀer  by 
an  element  in  the  left  nullspace).

Solution  (4  points):  In  both  cases,  elimination  kills  all  but  the  top  two  rows,  so,  if  p  =  0,  both 
matrices  have  rank  2  as  well  as  rowspace  bases  given  by  the  top  two  rows  (or  course,  if  p  =  0,  C

(a) Which  matrices X  lead  to  AX  = 0?

(a)  ﬁnds  the  “nullspace”  of  that  operation  AX  and  (b)  ﬁnds  the  “column  space”.  What  are 
the  dimensions  of  those  two  subspaces  of M?  Why  do  the  dimensions  add  to  (n − r) + r = 9?

(b)  On  the  other  hand,  the  columns  of  any  matrix  of  the  form  AX  are  linear  combinations  of 
the  columns  of  A.  That  is,  they  are  vectors  whose  components  all  sum  to  0,  so  a  matrix  has  the

The  dimension  of  the  “nullspace”  is  3,  while  the  dimension  of  the  “column  space”  is  6.  They 
add up to 9, which  is the dimension of the space of “inputs” of this matrix, when treated as a  linear 
map  on  matrices.
