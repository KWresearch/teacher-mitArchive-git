Expand  in  cofactors  to  show  that  Fn  =  Fn−1  + Fn−2 .  These  determinants  are  Fibonacci  numbers 
1,  2,  3,  5,  8,  13, . . . .  The  sequence  usually  starts  1,  1,  2,  3  (with  two  1’s)  so  our  Fn  is  the  usual 
Fn+1 . 
Solution  (see  pg. 535,  4  pts.):  The  1,  1  cofactor  of  the  n  by  n  matrix  is  Fn−1 .  The  1,  2  cofactor 
has  a  1  in  column  1,  with  cofactorFn−2 .  Multiply  by  (−1)1+2  and  also  (−1)  from  the  1,  2  entry  to 
ﬁnd  Fn  = Fn−1  + Fn−2  (so  these  determinants  are  Fibonacci  numbers).

Prob. 32,  Sec. 5.2,  Pg. 268:  Cofactors  of  the  1,  3,  1  matrices  in  Problem  21  give  a  recursion 
Sn  = 3Sn−1  − Sn−2 .  Amazingly  that  recursion  produces  every  second  Fibonacci  number.  Here  is 
the  challenge. 
Show  that  Sn  is  the  Fibonacci  number  F2n+2  by  proving  F2n+2  = 3F2n  − F2n−2 .  Keep  using  Fibo­
nacci’s  rule  Fk  = Fk−1  + Fk−2  starting  with  k = 2n + 2. 
Solution  (see  pg. 535,  12  pts.):  To  show  that  F2n+2  = 3F2n  − F2n−2 ,  keep  using  Fibonacci’s  rule: 
F2n+2  = F2n+1  + F2n  = F2n  + Fn−1  + F2n  = 2F2n  + (F2n  − F2n−2 ) = 3F2n  − F2n−2 .

Solution  (see  pg. 535,  12  pts.):  The  diﬀerence  from  20  to  19  multiplies  its  cofactor,  which  is  the 
determinant  of  the  3  by  3  Pascal matrix,  so  equal  to  1.  Thus  the  det  drops  by  1.

(d)  the  eigenvalues  of  (B 2  + I )−1 . 
Solution  (4  pts.):  (a)  The  rank  is  at most  2  since  B  is  singular  as  0  is  an  eigenvalue.  The  rank  is 
not  0  since  B  is  not  0  as  B  has  a  nonzero  eigenvalue.  The  rank  is  not  1  since  a  rank-1  matrix  has 
only  one  nonzero  eigenvalue  as  every  eigenvector  lies  in  the  column  space.  Thus  the  rank  is  2.

Solution  (4  pts.):  Since  the  eigenvalues  of  a  triangular  matrix  are  its  diagonal  entries,  the  eigen­

Challenge  problem:  in MATLAB  (and  in GNU Octave),  the  command  A=toepliz(v)  produces 
a  symmetric matrix  in which  each  descending  diagonal  (from  left  to  right)  is  constant  and  the  ﬁrst 
row  is  v .  For  instance,  if  v = [0  1  0  0  0  1],  then  toepliz(v)  is  the matrix  with  1s  on  both  sides  of 
the main  diagonal  and  on  the  far  corners,  and  0s  elsewhere.  More  generally,  let  v(n)  be  the  vector 
in Rn  with  a  1  in  the  second  and  last  places  and  0s  elsewhere,  and  let  A(n)=toepliz(v(n)). 
(a)  Experiment  with  n = 5, . . . , 12  in MATLAB  to  see  the  repeating  pattern  of  det A(n). 
(b) Expand  det A(n)  in  terms  of  cofactors  of  the  ﬁrst  row  and  in  terms  of  cofactors  of  the  ﬁrst 
column.  Use  the known determinant Cn  of problem 5.2.13  to  recover  the pattern  found  in part  (a).
