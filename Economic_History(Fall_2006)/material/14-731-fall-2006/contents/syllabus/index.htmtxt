***** Course Overview *****
We will endeavor to teach you about three things in the course:
   1. Economic History, in particular, processes like industrialization and
      demographic change that took a long time, and policies that affected
      them.
   2. Applied Economics, emphasizing the great variety of approaches that have
      been used to formulate and test hypotheses.
   3. Paper Writing, by examining critically the economic-history literature
      and giving you an opportunity to practice writing a paper suitable for a
      professional journal (as some term papers, after revision, have been).
***** Course Requirements *****
The assigned reading should be completed before the date noted on the syllabus.
Class discussion will be more productive and enjoyable if you have done the
reading. There will be a short final exam in the last scheduled class period
and a term paper that is due at the end of the semester. Additional details
about the paper can be found in the assignments section.
The term paper is the most important part of the written requirement for this
subject. Extensions will be given only for unanticipated events. Late papers
will receive lowered grades on a gradient that makes passing this course
problematical with a paper that is more than a few days late. Plan accordingly.
