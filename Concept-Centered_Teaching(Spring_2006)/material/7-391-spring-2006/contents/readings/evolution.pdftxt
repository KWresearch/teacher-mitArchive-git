Evolution 
 
I.  The Evolution Controversy 
 

•  Have the students design their own end-of-term evaluation sheet 
•  Have them copy the evaluation down and submit it after class.  Be sure to 
emphasize that all points of view are important and valid! 

1.  Should evolution be taught in public schools?  Should rationale design be taught? 
 
2.  In which grade should we begin teaching evolution?  At what age are students 
capable of understanding evolution? 

3.  Is biology the only subject that should address evolution?  If not, where else does 
it fit in a school curriculum? 

4.  Should students whose religious beliefs conflict with evolution be allowed to 
abstain from this portion of the curriculum? 

5.  When and where was evolution introduced to you?  Was a religious component 
included as well? 

6.  Should textbooks include chapters on evolution?  Discuss the disclaimer stickers 
being applied to books in some communities.   

7.  How has the media influenced the evolution argument?   

8.  What is the difference between a scientific theory and a normal “theory”?  How 
do we enforce the different meanings?
