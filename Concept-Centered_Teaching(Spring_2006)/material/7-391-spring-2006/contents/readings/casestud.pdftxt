Case Studies 
 
I.  Legistics 
 

1.  Should case studies be worked in or out of class? 
 
2.  Should students work together or alone?  Why? 

3.  How do you grade case studies? 

 
II.  Case Studies 
 

1.  Do certain topics in biology lend themselves to case studies?  If so which ones 
and why? 

 
2.  How effective is a case study module for teaching large courses? 

3.  Should lecture be used to supplement information presented in case studies?   

4.  Allowing studies to design their own experiments for the case study becomes very 
expensive.  Is there a way to do this and keep the cost down? 

5.  In high school, could a case study class take the place of multiple subjects?  A 
college nonmajors science class? 

6.  How often would a case study based class have to meet?  More or less often than 
a traditional lecture? 

7.  How can you use case studies in large lecture classes? 

8.  In what context do you use case studies?  To supplement lecture?  Instead of
