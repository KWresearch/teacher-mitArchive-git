I.  Predictors of Success in College  
 

•  Ask the class to brainstorm topics we covered in high school physics 
•  Discuss what we do and don’t remember and discuss if asking college students to 
remember high school is the best way to assess predictors of college success. 

1.  How important do you think race, ethnicity, gender, social economic class, etc. 
are in predicting someone’s success in biology?  What can teachers do to help 
students overcome these variables? 

 
2.  How do we retain minorities in science?  Are there programs specifically 
designed to do this? 

3.  Do you think particular textbooks are better or worse in preparing students for 
college biology or the faculty involved is more important?  

4.  The paper suggests changes in high school physics courses that could help better 
prepare students.  Could these changes be applied to college, too? 

5.  A movement has now been made to include TEAL-like classrooms or class talk in 
college physics classrooms.  Do you think these devices and methods are 
effective? 

6.  This paper uses college grades as a measure of success.  Are grades the only 
measure of success?  What about retention?  How do we assess these ideas? 

7.  Why does having a professor of the same gender as the student increase the 
student’s performance? 

8.  How can covering fewer topics help the students understanding and retention? 

9.  Why are homework problems negatively correlated with students’ grades?   

10. Why do demonstrations and demonstration discussions not help students learn 
physics? 

11. Are all of the correlations and regressions really useful values?
