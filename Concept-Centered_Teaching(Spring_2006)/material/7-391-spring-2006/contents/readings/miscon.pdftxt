Activity 
 

•  Ask the students to come up with a concept taught in introductory-level biology.   
•  Write the concept on the board and have the class break the statement down into 
individual concepts. 
•  Discuss how students in an intro class can get confused by complex ideas that we 
take for granted and the levels of understanding it takes to explain the original 
concept. 

 
Confronting Student Misconceptions 
 
I.  Background about misconceptions  
 

1.  At what age do students develop misconceptions? 
 
2.  How are these misconceptions seeded? 

 

 

 

 

 

3.  Is a student more likely to have misconceptions in science classes than in other 
subjects? 

4.  Do certain groups of students come into a class with different misconceptions 
based on race, gender, social status, etc.? 

 
II. What are misconceptions? 
 

1.  How can we identify what misconceptions our students have in a timely manner 
before the class begins? 

 
2.  How can we confront the misconceptions that our students have? 

3.  How can we make our students aware of their misconceptions? 

4.  How do we reinforce truths? 

5.  How can we design a curriculum that enforces concept-centered teaching?

6.  Does concept-centered teaching work for all ages?  

7.  If we make our students aware of their misconceptions, do we actually risk 
causing the misconception to take a greater hold? 

8.  How do we combat misconceptions, when those very same thoughts may be 
reinforced in other settings? 

 
III. Questions specific to the readings 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

1.  How are two-tiered questions used in these studies?  Do you feel these types of 
questions are effective means of assessing student misconceptions?  How do 
“strategic test-takers” fair in these assessments? 

 
2.  Did the teachers in these examples bias the results by his/her bias towards the 
effectiveness of concept-centered teaching?  Are the assessment methods 
appropriate? 

3.  How were the questions to test misconceptions formulated?  How do you pin-
point misconceptions if you do not know what your students do not understand? 

4.  Because different scientific disciplines teach the same processes, like diffusion 
and osmosis, from different angles, can we write exams that keep in mind all the 
different views of the same processes? 

5.   How could we apply the conceptual change method to larger classroom settings? 

6.  Is the conceptual change method a new way of teaching, or just a way of 
systematically doing what effective teachers do automatically?   

7.  Can such a method be used by high school teachers that were only forced to 
“know” material in college, and never really came to “understand” the material 
themselves?  

8.  How do you delineate between what people “know” and what they “understand”?
