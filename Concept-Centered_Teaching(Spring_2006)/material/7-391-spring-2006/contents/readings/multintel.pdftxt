7.391 Concept-Centered Teaching 
Semester I 
 
Discussion Day 4:  March 8, 2006 
 
Activity 
 
 
•  Go around the room and ask each student to decide which intelligence most 
accurately reflects them.  Encourage them to give multiple categories if they think 
their personality is reflected by more than one.  Write all the categories on the 
board. 
•  Discuss as a class any trends observed in the categories and whether or not they 
feel biology majors tend to be a particular intelligence. 

 
Multiple Intelligences 
 
I.  Multiple Intelligences 
 

 

 

 

 

 

1.  1. Does anyone really fall into one category or are we a combination of many 
types of intelligences of varying degree? 

 
2.  Who is Piaget and what were his theories on intelligence and development? 

3.  Is visual intelligence really separate from logical intelligence if it allows one to 
solve puzzles? 

4.  Are there other intelligence theories or is the Garner theory the most accepted? 

5.  When do people reach the peak end-state of these intelligences?  How do you 
assess the peak? 

 
 
II. MI and Biology 
 

1.  How can we determine at the beginning of a course in which intelligence our 
students excel? 

 
2.  What types of activities and exercises can be designed in biology for students of 
different intelligences? 

 
3.  Which intelligences are most developed in students who major in biology? 

4.  Do current methods of teaching biology cater and/or select for certain 
intelligences? 

5.  How can MI be used in concept-centered teaching?

6.  Can a teacher really teach in different ways to cater to all of his/her students’ 
different intelligences? 

7.  Should teachers try and develop weaker intelligences in their students?  How? 

8.  Does our society value some intelligences over others? 

9.  Should teachers try to teach to a student’s particular intelligence or should 
teachers try to help the student become more adept at their weaker intelligences? 

10. Is teaching to multiple intelligences realistic in large lecture classrooms?
