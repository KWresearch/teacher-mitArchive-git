7.391 Concept-Centered Teaching 
Semester I 
 
Discussion Day 5:  April 12, 2006 
 
Activity 
 

•  Ask the students to develop a crude concept map using the basic concepts of 
biology under the headings “Genetics”, “Biochemistry”, and “Molecular 
Biology.” 
•  Discuss the possible impact of such maps on student understand of the big picture 
in introductory biology. 

 
Concept Mapping 
 
I.  Group Dynamics  
 

 
II. Creating a concept map 
 

1.  For concept mapping is it better to have the students in the same groups all year or 
to mix the groups up? 

 
2.  Should concept-mapping be done alone or as a group? 

3.  How should groups be assigned for this type of activity? 

1.  Should you teach your students how to do a model concept map in class so they 
know how to do it before assigning the individual concept map? 

 
2.  Which students benefit the most by concept mapping?  The struggling students or 
the “smart” ones? 

 
3.  Would this approach work better or worse in a setting including a group of 
students with diverse science backgrounds? 

4.  Are there certain subjects in biology that lend themselves better to concept 
mapping than others?  Which ones?  Why? 

5.  Should the teacher periodically go over the maps with the students or allow them 
to work on their own? 

6.  Will the students benefit from trading maps? 

7.  How do you make sure all students are participating?

8.  How do you make sure that the concept map is not seeding misconceptions as 
opposed to reinforcing truths? 

9.  How do you grade a concept map? 

10. Is concept mapping or the group learning component that increases student 
learning?
