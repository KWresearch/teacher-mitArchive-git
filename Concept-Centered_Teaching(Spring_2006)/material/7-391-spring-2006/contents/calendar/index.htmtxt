SESÂ TOPICS                             In Class ActivitIES
1      Introduction - The Importance of
       Scientific Teaching and Mentoring
                                          Ask the students to brainstorm a list
                                          of individuals they would want
                                          included on an undergraduate biology
                                          curriculum panel.
2      Reforming Undergraduate Biology
       Education                          Compare and contrast their list and
                                          the panel involved in Bio2010.

                                          Discuss the pros and cons of each
                                          individual.
                                          Ask the students to come up with a
                                          concept taught in introductory-level
                                          biology.

                                          Write the concept on the board and
                                          have the class break the statement
3      Confronting Student Misconceptions down into individual concepts.

                                          Discuss how students in an intro
                                          class can get confused by complex
                                          ideas that we take for granted and
                                          the levels of understanding it takes
                                          to explain the original concept.
                                          Activity 1

                                          Ask the class to come up with a list
                                          of topics they feel are vital for
                                          students to learn in introductory
                                          biology.

                                          Write down all topics on the board
                                          whether or not everyone agrees.

4      Teaching Complex Material as a     Go through the list one by one and
       Series of Basic Concepts           discuss whether or not the entire
                                          class agrees on the inclusion of the
                                          topic.

                                          Discuss how this exercise represents
                                          the problems faced when establishing
                                          a national curriculum.

                                          Activity 2 (Time Permitting)

                                          The shape game.
                                          Go around the room and ask each
                                          student to decide which intelligence
                                          most accurately reflects them.
                                          Encourage them to give multiple
                                          categories if they think their
                                          personality is reflected by more than
5      Multiple Intelligences             one. Write all the categories on the
                                          board.

                                          Discuss as a class any trends
                                          observed in the categories and
                                          whether or not they feel biology
                                          majors tend to be a particular
                                          intelligence.
6      Usability Testing
                                          Ask the students to think of the
                                          different ways they were assigned to
                                          groups and write down the methods on
7      Cooperative Learning               the board.

                                          Discuss the pros and cons of each
                                          method and what their personal
                                          impressions were of each style.
                                          Have the students brainstorm possible
                                          topics in biology that would lend
                                          themselves to case study format.
8      Case Studies
                                          Make the students choose one topic
                                          and design a scenario for it in the
                                          classroom.
                                          Ask the students to develop a crude
                                          concept map using the basic concepts
                                          of biology under the headings
                                          "Genetics", "Biochemistry", and
9      Concept Mapping                    "Molecular Biology."

                                          Discuss the possible impact of such
                                          maps on student understand of the big
                                          picture in introductory biology.
                                          Ask the students to brainstorm the
                                          different ways in which a laboratory
                                          could be incorporated into a school
                                          curriculum as a stand alone class, in
                                          addition to lecture, as a project
10     Concept-based Laboratories and     lab, etc.
       Lecture Connections
                                          Discuss the pros and cons of each
                                          format.

                                          Ask the class to come to a consensus
                                          as to which is the best method.
                                          Ask the class to brainstorm topics we
                                          covered in high school physics.

11     Predictors of Success in College   Discuss what we do and don't remember
       Science                            and discuss if asking college
                                          students to remember high school is
                                          the best way to assess predictors of
                                          college success.
                                          Ask the students to brainstorm the
                                          different ways in which they have
                                          been graded in the past.
12     Assessment
                                          Discuss the type of class in which
                                          these methods were used and which
                                          method they feel was most effective
                                          in determining how much they learned.
                                          Have the students grade a mock exam
                                          of all types of questions including
                                          true/false, multiple choice, short
                                          answer, matching, fill in, etc.
13     Student Self-assessment
                                          Have the students evaluate each type
                                          of question for clarity, ease of
                                          grading, and assessment of concept
                                          knowledge.
                                          Have the students design their own
                                          end-of-term evaluation sheet.

14     Teaching Evolution                 Have them copy the evaluation down
                                          and submit it after class. Be sure to
                                          emphasize that all points of view are
                                          important and valid!
