(a) A point charge q above a flat dielectric boundary requires different sets of image charges to 
solve for the fields in each region.  (b) The field in region I is due to the original charge and the 
image charge q' while the field in region II is due only to image charge q". 
A point charge q is within a region of permittivity H1 and is a distance d above a planar boundary 
separating region I from region II, which has a permittivity H2G. There is no unpaired (free) surface 
charge on the interface at y=0. The tangential component of  E  and the normal component of  D 
must be continuous across the interface. 
Let us try to use the method of images by placing an image charge qc at y=-d so that the solution 
in region I is due to this image charge plus the original point charge q. The solution for the field 
in region II will be due to an image charge q" at y=d, the position of the original point charge. 
Note that the appropriate image charge is always outside the region where the solution is desired. 
At this point we do not know if it is possible to satisfy the boundary conditions with these image 
charges, but we will try to find values of qc and q" to do so. 
a)  What are the potential and electric field distributions in region I (y>0) and region II (y<0) 
in terms of q, qc, and q"? 
G
What equations relate q, qc, and q" to satisfy continuity of tangential  E 
 and normal  D ? 
Solve for qc and q" in terms of q, H1 and H2. 
What is the force on the point charge q?
