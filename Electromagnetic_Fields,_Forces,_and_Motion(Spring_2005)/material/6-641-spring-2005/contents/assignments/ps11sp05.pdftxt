Problem  11.1  (W&M  Prob  10.8) 

An  electromagnetic  wave  can  be  transmitted  through  or  reﬂected  by  a  plasma,  depending  on  the  frequency 
of  the wave relative to the plasma frequency  ωp .  This phenomenon,  which is fundamental  to the propagation 
of  radio  signals  in  the  ionosphere,  is  illustrated  by  the  following  simple  example  of  a  cutoﬀ  wave.  In  dealing 
with  electromagnetic  waves,  we  require  that  both  the  electric  displacement  current  in  Ampere’s  law  and 
the  magnetic induction in Faraday’s law (See Section B.2.1)  be  accounted for.  We  consider  one-dimensional 
plane  waves  in  which  E =  ixEx (z , t) and  H =  iyHy (z , t).

The  space  is  ﬁlled  with  plasma  composed  of  equal  numbers  of  ions  and  electrons.  Assume  that  the  more 
massive  ions  remain  ﬁxed  and  that  ne  is  the  electron  number  density,  whereas  e  and  m  are  the  electronic 
charge  and  mass.  Use  a  linearized  force  equation  to  relate  Ex  and  vx ,  where  vx  is  the  average  electron 
velocity  in the  x-direction.

Relate  vx  and  Jx  to linear terms.

Problem  11.2  (W&M  Prob  10.10) 

Figure  2:  A  charged  insulating  string  is  below  an   oppositely  charged  rigid  rod. 

A  rigid  straight  rod  supports  a  charge  Q  coulombs  per  unit  length  and  is  ﬁxed.  Just  below  this  rod 
an  insulating  string  is  stretched  between  ﬁxed  supports,  as  shown  in  Fig.  10P.10.  This  string,  which  has  a 
tension  f  and  mass  per  unit  length  m,  supports  a  charge  per  unit  length  −q ,  where  q  � Q and both  Q and 
q  are positive. 
A 

What  should  qQ  be  in  order  that  the  string  have  the  static  equilibrium  ξ  =  0  in  spite  of  the  gravitational 
acceleration  g? 
B 

What  is  the  largest  value  of  m  that is consistent  with the equilibrium  of part (a) being  stable? 

C 

How  would  you  alter  this  physical  situation  to  make  the  static  equilibrium  stable  even  with  m  larger  than 
given by (b)?

Problem  11.3  (W&M  Prob  10.13) 

A pair of perfectly conducting  membranes  are stretched between rigid  supports at  x  = 0  and  x  =  L,  as  shown 
in  FIg.   10P.13.  The  membranes  have  the  applied  voltage  Vθ  with  respect  to  each  other  and  with  respect  to 
plane-parallel  electrodes. 

Figure 3: A pair of perfectly  conducting  membranes  at voltage diﬀerences  V0  with  respect  to  each  other  and 
with  respect  to  plane-parallel  electrodes. 
A 

Write  a  pair  of  diﬀerential  equations  in  ξ1 (x, t) and  ξ2 (x, t) which  describe  the  membrane  motions.  Assume 
that  ξ1  and  ξ2  are  small  enough  to  warrant  linearization   and  that  the  wavelengths  are  long  enough   that   the 
membranes  appear  ﬂat  to  the  electric  ﬁeld  at  any  one  value  of  x. 
B 

Assume that 
ξ1  = Reξˆ 1 ej (ωt−kx) 
ξ2  = Reξˆ 2 ej (ωt−kx) 

and  ﬁnd  a  dispersion  equation  relating  ω  and  k. 

C 
Make  an  ω − k  plot showing  the  results of part (b), including imaginary values of  ω  for  real  values  of  k. (This 
equation  should  be  biquadratic  in  ω). 

D 

At  what potential  V0  will  the  static  equilibrium  ξ1  = 0  and  ξ2  = 0  ﬁrst  become  unstable?  Describe  the  mode 
of instability.

Problem  11.4  (W&M  Prob  10.23) 

A pair  of perfectly  conducting  membranes move in the  x-direction   with  the  velocity  U .  The  membranes  have 
the  applied  voltage  V0  with  respect  to  one  another  and  to  plane-parallel  electrodes.  They  enter  the  region 
between  the  plates  from  rollers  at  x  =  0.

Figure  4:  A  pair  of  perfectly  conducting  membranes  at  respective  voltages  V0  moving  with  velocity  U . 

A 

Write  a  pair  of  diﬀerential  equations  in  ξ1 (x, t)  and  ξ2 (x, t)  to  describe  the  membrane  motions.  Assume 
that  ξ1  and  ξ2  are  small  enough  to  warrant  linearization  and  that  the  wavelengths  are  long  enough  for  the 
membrane  to  appear  ﬂat  to  the  electric  ﬁeld  at  any  one  value  of  x. 

B 

Assume that 

ξ1  = Reξˆ 1 ej (ωt−kx) 
ξ2  = Reξˆ 2 ej (ωt−kx) 

and  ﬁnd  a  dispersion  equation  relating  ω  and  k. 

C 
Make  an  ω − k  plot to  show the  results  of part (b), including  complex  values  of  k  for  real  values  of  ω .  This 
 
�
equation  can  be  factored  into  two  quadratic  equations  for  k.  Assume  that  U  > 
S/σm . 

D 

One  of  the  quadratic  factors  in  part  (c)  describes  motions  in  which  ξ1 (x, t) =  ξ2 (x, t),  whereas  the  other 
describes  motions  in  which  ξ1 (x, t) =  −ξ2 (x, t).  Show  that  this  is  true  by  assuming  ﬁrst  that  ξ1  =  ξ2  and 
then that  ξ1  =  −ξ2  in parts (a)  and (b). 

E 
Now  suppose  that  the  rollers  at  x  =  0  are  given  the  sinusoidal  excitation  ξ1 (0, t)  = Re ˆ
ξejωt 
=  −ξ2 (0, t), 
where  ξˆ is  the  same  real  constant  for  each  excitation.  Also,  0  =  ∂x 
∂ ξ1  =  ∂ ξ2
∂x  at  x  =  0.  Find  ξ1 (x, t)  and 
ξ2 (x, t). 

F

Problem  11.5  (W&M  Prob  10.21) 

A  perfectly  conducting  membrane  with  the  tension   S  and  mass  per  unit  area  σm  is  ejected  from  a  nozzle 
along  the  x-axis  with  velocity  U .  Gravity  acts  as  shown  in  Fig.  10P.21. 

Figure  5:  A  perfectly  conducting  membrane  moving  at  velocity  U . 

A  planar  electrode  above  the  membrane  has  the  constant  potential  V0  relative  to  the  membrane. 

A 

What  value  of  V0  is  required  to  make  the  membrane  assume  an   equilibrium  parallel  to  the  electrode? 

B 

Now, under the conditions in (a), the membrane is excited  at  the frequency  ωd ;  what  is  the  lowest  frequency
