Problem  10.1  (W&M  Prob  9.1) 

A  long  thin  steel  cable  of  unstressed  length  l  is  hanging  from  a  ﬁxed  support,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  9P.1. 
Assume  that  the  origin  of  coordinates  is  at  the  support  and  that  x  measures positive  as shown.  Assume that  
the  steel  cable  has  the  following  constants. 

Cross-sectional  area 
Young’s  modulus 
Mass density 
Maximum  allowable  stress 

A  =  10−4m2 
E  = 2.0 ×  1011N/m2 
ρ  = 7.8 ×  103kg/m3 
Tmax  = 2 ×  109N/m2

Problem  10.2 

A  thin  elastic  rod  has  an  initial  velocity  and  stress  distribution:

T (x, t  = 0)  = 0

The  rod  has  Young’s  modulus  E ,  mass  density  ρ,  and  cross-sectional  area  A.

If  the  rod  is  of  inﬁnite  length,  −∞  < x <  ∞,  plot  the  time  and  space  solutions  of  v(x, t)  and  T (x, t) in  a 
similar  way  as  shown  in  Fig.  9.18  of  the  Woodson/Melcher  text.

If  the  rod  is  of  ﬁnite  length  a, 0  < x <  a,  with  ﬁxed  boundaries  at  x  =  0  and  x  =  a, plot  v(x, t) and  T (x, t). 

Problem  10.3  (W&M  Prob  9.6) 

Figure  3:  A  thin,  circular  magnetic  rod 

A  thin,  circular  magnetic  rod  is  ﬁxed  at  one  end  and  constrained  at  the  other  end  by  a  transducer 
(Fig  9P.6).  In  the  absence  of  an  excitation,  the  transducer  is  simply  biased  by  the  constant  current  source

I .  When  the  rod  is  in  static  equilibrium,  its  length  is  l  and  the  gap  spacing  is  d.  Compute  the  natural 
frequencies  of  the  system  under  the  assumption   that  the  magnetization   force  on   the  rod  acts  on   the  end 
surface.  A  graphical  representation  of  the  eigenfrequencies  is  an   adequate  solution.

Problem  10.4  (W&M  Prob  9.10) 

A  long  thin  rod  is  ﬁxed  at  x  = 0  and  driven  at  x  =  l,  as shown in Fig.  9P.10.  The driving  transducer consists 
of   a  rigid  plate  with  area  A  attached  to  the  end  of  the  rod,  where  it  undergoes  the  displacement  δ(l, t) from  
an equilibrium position exactly  between two ﬁxed plates.  These ﬁxed plates  are biased by potentials  V0  and 
driven  by  the  voltage  v  = Re(Vˆ ejωt ) as  shown.  (|Vˆ | � V0 )
