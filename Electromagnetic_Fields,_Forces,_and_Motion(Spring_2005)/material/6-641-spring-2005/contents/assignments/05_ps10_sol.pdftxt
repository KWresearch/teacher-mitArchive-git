Problem  10.1 

The  equation  of  motion  for  a  static  rod  is 

0 =  E 

∂ 2 δ 
∂x2 

+  Fx  where  Fx  =  ρg 

We  can  integrate  this  equation  directly  and  get 
ρg  �  x2 � 
δ(x) =  − E 
2
where  C  and  D  are  arbitrary  constants. 

+  C x +  D 

A 

The  stress  function  is  T (x) =  E dδ  ,  and  therefore 
dx

T (x) =  −ρgx +  C E 
We  have  a  free  end  at  x  =  l  and  this implies  T (x  =  l) = 0.  Now we can write the stress as 

T (x) =  −ρgx +  ρg l 
The  maximum  stress  occurs  at  x  = 0  and  is  Tmax  =  ρg l.  Equating  this  to  the  maximum  allowable  stress,  we 
have 

2 × 109  = (7.8 × 103 )(9.8)l 

l  = 2.6 × 104  meters 

hence 

B 

From part (a) 

T (x) =  −ρgx +  ρg l 
The  ﬁxed  end  at  x  = 0 implies that  D  = 0,  so  now  we  can  write  the  displacement

Problem  10.3 

First, we can calculate the force of  magnetic origin,  fx , on the rod.  If  we deﬁne  δ(l, t) to be the a.c.  deﬂection 
on the rod  at  x  =  l, then using Ampere’s law and  the Maxwell  stress tensor (Eq.  8.5.41 with  magnetostriction 
ignored)  we  ﬁnd

This  result  can  also be  obtained  using  the  energy  methods  of Chap.  3 (See Appendix  E, Table 3.1).  Since 
d  � δ(l, t),  we  may linearize  fx

fx  =
δ(l, t)

The  ﬁrst  term  represents  a  constant  force  which  is  balanced  by  a  static  deﬂection  on  the  rod.  If  we  assume 
that  this  static  deﬂection  is  included  in  the  equilibrium  length  l,  then  we  need  only  use  the  last  term  of  fx 
to  compute  the  dynamic  deﬂection  δ(l, t).  In  the  bulk  of  the  rod  we  have  the  wave  equation;  for  sinusoidal 
variations

δ(x, t) = Re  δˆ(x)ejωt 
we  can  write  the  complex  amplitude  δˆ(x) as 
δˆ(x) =  C1 sin  βx +  C2 cos βx 
ρ  .  At  x  = 0  we  have  a  ﬁxed  end,  so  δ(0)ˆ  = 0 and  C2  = 0.  At  x  =  l  the  boundary  condition  is

Our  solution  is  δˆ(x) =  C1 sin βx  and  for  a  non-trivial  solution  we  must  have  C1  = 0.  So, divide (1)  by  C1  to 
obtain  the  resonance  condition:

which,  when  solved  for  ω ,  yields  the  eigenfrequencies.  Graphically,  the  ﬁrst  two  eigenfrequencies  are  found 
from  the  sketch.  Notice  that  as  the  current  I  is  increased,  the  slope  of  the  straight  line  decreases  and  the 
ﬁrst  eigenfrequency  (denoted  by  ω1 )  goes  to  zero  and  then  seemingly  disappears  for  still  higher  currents. 
Actually  ω1  now  becomes  imaginary  and  can  be  found  from  the  equation

Just  as  there  are  negative  solutions  to  (2),  −ω1 , −ω2 , . . .  etc.,  so  there  are  now  solutions  ±j |ω1 |.  Thus, 
because  ω1  is imaginary, the  system is  unstable, (amplitude  of  one  solution growing  in time). 
Hence  when  the  slope  of  the  straight  line  becomes  less  than  unity,  the  system  is  unstable.  This  condition 
can  be  stated  as

Problem  10.4 

A 

At  the  outset,  we  can  write  the  equation  of  motion  for  the  massless  plate: 

f e (t) = 

∂ 2 δ 
−aT (l, t) + f e (t) =  M 
∂ t2  (l, t) ≈ 0 
Using  the  maxwell  stress  tensor  we  ﬁnd  the  force  of  electrical  origin  f e (t) to be 
ε0A  �  (V0  +  v(t))2 
(V0  − v(t))2  �

(d − δ(l, t))2  − (d − δ(l, t))2

Since  v(t) � V0  and  δ(l, t) � d,  we  can  linearize  f e (t):

Recognizing  that  T (l, t) =  E ∂x (l, t) we  can  write  our  boundary  condition  at  x  =  l  in the desired form

Longitudinal  displacements  in  the  rod  obey  the  wave  equation  and  for  an  assumed  form  of  δ(x, t) =

Re  δˆ(x)ejωt  we  can  write  δˆ(x) =  C1 sin βx  +  C2 cos βx,  where  β  =  ω �  E
ρ  .  At  x  =  0  we  have  a  ﬁxed 
end, thus  δˆ(x  = 0)  = 0 and  C2  = 0.  From part (a)  and  assuming  sinusoidal  time dependence,  we  can  write 
our  boundary  condition  at  x  =  l  as
