Problem  8.1 

A 

From  Fig.  6P.1  we  see  the  geometric  relations 

r  �  =  r, θ �  =  θ  − Ωt, z �  =  z , t�  =  t 

There  is  also  a  set  of  back  transformations 

r  =  r  � , θ  =  θ �  + Ωt, z  =  z  � , t  =  t�

Hence,

Equations (6)  and (2)  are identical.  Equations (8), (7), and (4)  are identical if  V (t) =  V0 .  Since  we  used (2) 
and (4)  to solve the  ﬁrst part we would get the same answer using (6)  and (7)  in the second part.

C 

As  the  current  becomes  large,  the  electrical  nonlinearity  of  the  magnetic  circuit  will  limit  the  exponential 
growth  and determine  a level  of  stable  steady  state  operation (see Fig.  6.4.12).
