We  want  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  to  remain  ﬁnite  at  r  = 0, hence  C2  = 0.

At  r  =  a 
B (a, t) =  µ0H0  − C1J0 (√µ0σαa) =  µ0H0 
Hence if  C1  = 0

over  surface (4)  H¯ = 0, and  over surface (2),  H¯ is in  the  ¯i1  direction,  where  ¯n  = ¯i2 .  Thus  over  surface (2),

The appropriate surface of integration, which is  ﬁxed  with  respect to the  ﬁxed frame, is shown in Figure (5). 
We  compute the time  average force,  and hence  contributions from  surfaces (1)  and (3)  cancel.  Fields go to 
zero on surface (2),  which is  at  y  → ∞.  Thus,  there  remains  the  stress  on  surface (4).  The  time  average 
value  of  the  surface  force  density  T¯ is  independent  of  x.  Hence,
