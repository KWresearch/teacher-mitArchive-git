Problem 3.2

When a bird perches on a dc high-voltage power line and then flies away, it does so carrying a 
net charge.  

(a)  Why? 
(b)  For the purpose of measuring this net charge Q carried by the bird, we have the apparatus 
pictured below.  Flush with the ground, a strip electrode having width w and length l is 
mounted so that it is insulated from ground.  The resistance, R, connecting the electrode 
to ground is small enough that the potential of the electrode (like that of the surrounding 
ground) can be approximated as zero.  The bird flies in the x direction at a height h above 
the ground with a velocity U.  Thus, its position is taken as y=h and x=Ut.  At time t, 
what is the effective charge distribution that will allow easy calculation of the electric 
scalar potential? 
(c)  The bird flies at an altitude h sufficiently large to make it appear as a point charge.  What 
is the potential distribution as a function of time and position (x, y, z)?

(e)  At time t, what is the net charge, q, on the electrode? (Assume that the width w is small 
compared to h so that in an integration over the electrode surface, the integration in the z 
direction is simply a multiplication by w.)
