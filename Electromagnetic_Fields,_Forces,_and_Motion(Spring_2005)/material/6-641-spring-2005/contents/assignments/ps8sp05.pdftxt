Problem  8.1  (W&M  Prob  6.1) 

Two  frames  of  reference  have  a  relative  angular  velocity  Ω,  as  shown  in  Fig.  6P.1.  In  the  ﬁxed  frame  a 
point in  space is designated by  the  cylindrical  coordinates (r, θ , z ).In  the  rotating  frame  the  same  point  is

Problem  8.2  (W&M  Prob  6.6) 

A  pair  of  cylinders  coaxial  with  the  z-axis,  as  shown  in  Fig.  6P.6,  forms  a  capacitor.  The  inner  and  outer 
surfaces have the potential diﬀerence  V  and  radii  a  and  b,  respectively.  The  cylinders  are  only  very  slightly 
conducting,  so  that  as  they  rotate  with  the  angular  velocity  ω  they  carry  along  the  charges  induced  on  their

surfaces.  As viewed from a frame rotating with  the cylinders, the charges are stationary.  We wish to compute  
the  resulting  ﬁelds. 
A 

Compute  the  electric  ﬁeld  between  the  cylinders  and  the  surface  charge  densities  σa  and  σb  on  the  inner   and 
outer  cylinders,  respectively. 

B 

Use the transformation for the  current density  to  compute the  current density  from the  results  of part (a). 

C 
In  turn,  use  the  current  density   to  compute  the  magnetic  ﬁeld   intensity  H  between  the  cylinders. 
D 

Now use the  ﬁeld transformation for the magnetic  ﬁeld intensity  to check  the result of part (c).

Problem  8.3  (W&M  Prob  6.12) 

The  system  shown  in  Fig.  6P.12  consists  of  two  parallel,  perfectly  conducting  plates  with  depth  D  and 
separation  W .  Between  these  plates  is  placed  a  perfectly  conducting  short-circuit  which  has  mass  M  and 
slides  with  viscous  coeﬃcient  of  friction  B .  You  may  assume  W  �  D  and  that  fringing  ﬁelds  may  be 
neglected.

Problem  8.4  (W&M  Prob  6.14) 

Figure 4 (6P.14)  shows  a   model for  a  self-excited dc  machine.  The  rotor is laminated in  such  a  way  that   i 
ﬂows  only  in  the  z  direction.  The  brushes  have  an  eﬀective  area  A,  hence  the  current  density   on   either   side 
i

brushes  compared  with   r .  The  far  end  of  the  rotor  is  assumed  to  be  inﬁnitely  conducting,   as  shown.  The  
rotor  is  driven  at   a  constant  angular   velocity  ω ;  Rint  does  not   include  the  eﬀect   of  the  conductivity  of  the 
rotor.

of  the  parameters  is  this  power  unbounded  as  t → ∞?
