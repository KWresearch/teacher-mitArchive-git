The mass spectrograph uses the circular motion to determine the masses of ions and to measure 
the relative proportions of isotopes. Charges enter between parallel plate electrodes with a y 
directed velocity distribution. Gravitational effects are negligible compared to the 
electric/magnetic forces since the ions have so little mass.

and magnetic fields are imposed so that the net force on a charge is

ii.	 Note that the charge circular path diameter d depends on the ion mass, and so can be used 
to detect different isotopes that have the same number of protons but a different number 
of neutrons. The isotopes thus have the same charge but different masses. Typically V=­
100 volts across a s=1 cm gap with a magnetic field of P o  H=1 tesla. The mass of a 
proton and neutron are each about m=1.67 x 10 27 kg. Consider the three isotopes of 
magnesium 12 Mg 24 ,  12Mg 25 , and 12 Mg 26  , each deficient of one electron. At what 
positions d will each isotope hit the photographic plate? 

b) 

A magnetron is essentially a parallel plate capacitor stressed 
by constant voltage Vo  where electrons of charge -e are 
emitted at x=0, y=0K  with zero initial velocity. A transverse 
magnetic field  H o i z  is applied. Neglect the electric and 
magnetic fields due to the electrons in comparison to the 
applied field. 

i.  What is the velocity and displacement of an 
electron, injected with zero initial velocity at t=0? 
ii.  What value of magnetic field will just prevent the 
electrons from reaching the other electrode? This 
is the cut-off magnetic field.

Two different blocks of material are placed within identical magnetic circuits with exciting 
currents  I o  sinZt .  Block A is described by a constant ohmic conductivity while Block B is a 
superconductor described by a plasma frequency Z p  .  Both blocks have constant magnetic 
permeability P and permittivity H .  The conduction constitutive laws for these blocks are:

a)  Use Ampere’s integral law to find the magnetic field  H y  in the free space region within the 
air-gap just to the left and right of the blocks. 
Hint:  There are  r z  directed current flows in the blocks but the net z directed current is zero.
