Problem  7.1  (W&M  Prob  3.3) 

A  slab  of  dielectric  slides  between  plane  parallel  electrodes  as  shown.  The  dielectric  obeys  the  constitutive 
law  D  =  α (E  · E ) E  +  ε0E ,  where  ε0  is  the  permittivity  of  free  space  and  α  is  a  constant.  Find  the  force  of 
electrical   origin  on  the  slab.  Your  answer  should  take  the  form  f =  f e (v , x).

Problem  7.2  (W&M  Prob.  3.16) 

A  plane  electrode  is  free  to  move  into  the  region   between  plane-parallel  electrodes,  as  shown  in  Fig.  3P.16. 
The  outer  electrodes  are  at  the  same  potential,  whereas  the  inner  electrode  is  at  a  potential  determined  by 
the  constant  voltage  source  V0  in  series  with  the  output  of  an   ampliﬁer  driven  by  a  signal  proportional  to 
the  displacement  of  the  movable  electrode  itself.  Hence  the  voltage  of  the  inner  electrode  relative  to  that   of 
the  outer  electrodes  is  v  =  −V0  +  Ax,  wehre  A  is  a  given  feedback  gain.  Find  the  force  of  electrical  origin 
f e (x).  (Note  that  this  force  is  only a  function   of  position,  since  the  voltage  is  a  known  function   of  x.)

Problem  7.3  (W&M  Prob.  3.4) 

A  magnetic  circuit,  including  a  movable  plunger,  is  shown  in  Fig.  3P.4.  The  circuit  is  excited  by  an  N -
turn  coil  and  consists  of  a  perfectly  permeable  yoke  and  plunger  with  a  variable  air  gap  x(t)  and  a  ﬁxed 
nonmagnetic  gap   d.  The  system,  with  the  cross  section   shown,  has  width  w  into  the  paper.  The  following 
parts  lead  to  a  mathematical  formulation  of  the  equations  of  motion   for  the  mass  M ,  given  the  excitation 
I (t). 

A 

Find  the  terminal  relation  for  the  ﬂux  λ(i, x)  linked  by  the  electrical  terminal  pair.  Ignore  fringing  in  the 
nonmagnetic  gaps.  Note  that  the  coil  links  the  ﬂux  through   the  magnetic  material  N  times. 

B 

Find  the  energy  Wm (λ, x) stored  in  the  electromechanical  coupling.  This  should  be  done  by  making  use  of 
part (a). 

C 

Use  the  energy  function  W m (λ, x) to  compute  the  force  of  electrical  origin  f acting  on   the  plunger. 
e

D 

Write  an electrical (circuit)  equation of motion involving  λ  and  x  as  the  only  dependent  variables  and  I (t) 
as  a  driving  function. 

D 

Write  the  mechanical  equation  of  motion  for  the  mass.  This  diﬀerential  equation   should  have  λ  and  x  as the 
only dependent variables, hence taken  with the  result  of (d)  should  constitute a mathematical formulation 
appropriate  for  analyzing  the  system  dynamics.

Problem  7.5  (W&M  Prob.  5.11) 

Figure 5P.11 shows a diagrammatic cross section of a two-phase, 
salient-pole  synchronous  machine.  The 
windings  in  an  actual  machine  are  distributed  in   many  slots  along   the  periphery  of  the  stator,  rather   than  
as  shown.  The  rotor  is  made  of  magnetically  soft   iron   which  has  no  residual  permanent   magnetism.  The 

Figure  5:  Cross  section  of  a  two-phase,  salient-pole  synchronous  machine 

electrical  terminal  relations  are 

λ1  = (L0  +  M  cos 2θ)i1  +  M  sin 2θi2 , 

λ2  =  M  sin 2θi1  + (L0  − M  cos 2θ)i2 . 

A 

Determine  the  torque  of  electrical  origin  T e (i1 , i2 , θ). 

B 

Assume  that  the  machine  is  excited  by  sources  such  that  i1  =  I cos ω s t,i2  =  I sin ω s t,  and  the  rotor  has  the 
constant  angular  velocity  ωm  such  that  θ  =  ωm t  +  γ .  Evaluate  the  instantaneous  torque  T .  Under  what 
e
conditions  is  it  constant? 

C 

The rotor is sub jected  to a mechanical  torque (acting  on it in the +θ-direction):  T  =  T0 + T � (t), where T0  is a 
constant.  The time-varying part  of  the torque perturbs the steady  rotation of (b) so that  θ  =  ω m t + γ0 + γ � (t).

6.641,  Spring  2005  

Assume that the  rotor has a moment of inertia J  but that there is no damping. Find  the possible equilibrium 
angles  γ0  between  the  rotor  and  the  stator  ﬁeld.  Then  write  a  diﬀerential  equation   for  γ � (t),  with T � (t) as a 
driving  function. 

D 

Consider  small  perturbations  of  the  rotation   γ � (t),  so  that  the  equation   of  motion   found  in  (c)  can  be 
linearized.  Find  the  response  to  an  impulse  of  torque  T � (t) =  I0µ0 (t),  assuming  that  before  the  impulse  in 
torque  the  rotation  velocity  is  constant. 

E 

Which  of   the  equilibrium  phase  angles  γ0  found in (c)  is  stable?
