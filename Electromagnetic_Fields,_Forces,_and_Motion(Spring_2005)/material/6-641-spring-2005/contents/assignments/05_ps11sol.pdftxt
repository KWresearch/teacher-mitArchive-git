Problem  11.1

The  given  equations  follow  by  writing  out  Maxwell’s  equations  and  assuming  E  and  H  have  the  given 
directions  and  dependences. 

B 

The  force  equation  for  an  incremental  volume  element  is 

∂ vx 
F¯ = ¯ixmne 
∂ t

where  F  is  the  force  density  due  to  electrical  forces  on  the  electrons 
F  = −ix eneEx

Thus,

We  have  a  dispersion  which  yields  evanescent  waves  below  the  plasma  (cutoﬀ )  frequency.  Below  this  fre­
quency,  the  electrons  respond  to  the  electric ﬁeld  associated with  the wave  in  such  a way  as  to  reﬂect  rather 
than  transmit  an  incident  electromagnetic wave. 

F 

Waves impinging on a boundary between free space and plasma will be totally reﬂected if the wave frequency 
ω < ωp .  The  plasma  frequency  for  the  ionosphere  is  typically  fp  ≈  10 MHz.  This  result  explains  why 
AM  broadcasts  (500 kHz  < f <  1500 kHz)  can  commonly  be  monitored  all  over  the  world,  whereas  FM 
(88 MHz < f  < 108 MHz)  has  a  range  limited  to “line-of-sight.”
