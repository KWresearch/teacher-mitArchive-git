Problem  9.1  (W&M  Prob  7.9)


Figure  1:  A  cylindrical  column  of  plasma  within  a  long  solenoid 

As  a possible plasma  containment  scheme, it has been proposed  to  create  a  cylindrical  column  of plasma 
within  a  long  solenoid.  The  plasma  is  created  by  use  of  an  arc  discharge  through  a  gas.  After  the  plasma 
is  formed  the  solenoid  is  excited  by  rapid  discharge  of  a  capacitor  bank  connected  to  the  terminals.  The 
magnetic  ﬁeld  of  the solenoid is initially  excluded from the interior of  the plasma column by  surface currents 
which  ﬂow in the theta direction on the plasma;  for this reason the device is called  a “Theta-pinch  machine.” 
Because  the  plasma  has  only  a  ﬁnite  conductivity,  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  diﬀuses  into  the  interior.  Therefore  to 
design  the  machine  it  is  necessary  to  determine  the  time  associated  with  this  ﬁeld  diﬀusion.  In  Fig.  7P.9a 
the plasma column is shown in the magnetic  ﬁeld.  Neglect end  eﬀects by  assuming  an inﬁnitely long  system. 
Furthermore,  assume  that  the  plasma  remains  stationary  during  the  diﬀusion  process. 

A 
Write  an  equation  governing  the  magnetic  ﬂux  density  B  inside the plasma. 

B 
Because  there  are  only  θ  currents  independent  of  θ ,  assume  that  B =  izB (r, t),  where B (r, t) has the form 
B (r, t) =  µ0H0  − Bˆ (r)e −αt  , 
which  satisﬁes  the  condition  that  B (r, t)
for  Bˆ (r). 

µ0H0  as  t  → ∞.  Using  the  results  of part (a),  write  an  equation 

α >  0 

→

C 
The  equation  obtained in part (b)  for  Bˆ (r)is  called “Bessel’s  equation  of  zeroth  order.”  The general  solution 
to  this  equation  is 
ˆB (r) =  C1J0 (√µ0σαr) + C2N0 (√µ0σαr),

where  J0  is  the  Bessel  function  of  zeroth  order  and  the  ﬁrst  kind  and  N0  is  the  Bessel  function  of  zeroth 
order and the second kind (sometimes called  a  “Neumann function”).  See Fig. 7P.9b.  Using  the boundary 
condition  at  r  = 0,  argue  that  C2  = 0, hence that  Bˆ (r) =  C1J0 (√µ0σαr).

Problem  9.5  (W&M  Prob  7.14) 

You  are working  on a transportation pro ject  and  are  asked  to make  an   analysis of the following basic method 
of   both  levitating  and  propelling  a  train.  The  train  rides  just  above  a  track  which  is  composed  of  a  slab

Figure  6:  Magnetic  levitation   and  propulsion  

with  conductivity  σ .  Superconducting  coils  within  the  train  are  arranged  to  produce  a  current  that  can  be 
represented  by  the  current  sheet  K  (see  Fig.  7P.14).  This  current  sheet  is  backed  by  a  highly  permeable 
magnetic  shield  (µ  → ∞)  which  is  also  attached  to  the  train.  (The  shield  prevents  magnetization   of  the 
passengers’  watches  and  the attendant possibility  that  t  =  t� .)  Here  x�  is  the  distance  measured  with  respect 
� 
to  the  moving  train.  Hence,  because  the  train  is  moving  in  the  x-direction   with  velocity  U ,  x  =  U t + x .  We 
wish  to compute the time average force per unit  area that presumably  holds the train a distance  s  (ks  � 1)  
above the track. 
A 

Express  the  surface  current  in  the  ﬁxed  frame  K(x, t). 
B 

Assume that the track is inﬁnitely thick in the  y -direction (under what conditions is this a good  assumption?) 
and  compute  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  and  current  in  the  conducting  track.  Assume  that  ∂  =  0.

C 
Compute the time average force per unit  area (in the  x  − z  plane)  that  holds  up  the  vehicle. 
D 
Compute the force per  unit (x  − z ) area  that  tends  to  propel  the  train  in  the  x− direction.  Do  you   see  any 
basic  problems  with  the  proposed  scheme  of  propulsion?

Problem  9.6  (W&M  Prob  8.21) 

In  problem  7.14  a  vehicle  system  was  proposed  in  which  a  magnetic  ﬁeld  provided  both  suspension  (i.e., 
levitation)  and  propulsion  forces.  There  it  was  assumed  that  the  condition   ks  � 1  is  valid  and,  to  calculate 
the  volume  force  density,  J × B  was  applied.  The  Maxwell  stress  tensor  provides  an   alternate  and  useful 
method for the calculation of the forces per unit  area (Fig. 8P.21).  The solution for the magnetic ﬁeld in the 
region  −∞ < y  <  0 is

B 
Using the stress tensor,  compute the time average force per unit  area (in the  x  − z  plane)  that  holds  the 
vehicle  up.  Take  advantage  of  the  periodic  variation   with  x  to  deﬁne  a  suitable  surface.

Again using  the stress tensor, compute the time average force per unit  area (x  − z ) that tends to propel  the 
train.

Problem  9.7 

The  ﬁgure  below  shows  a  magnetohydrodynamic  generator.  In   this  generator,  a  ﬂuid  having  conductivity 
σ  and  free-space  permeability  is  pumped  through   a  rectangular  channel  with  velocity  U  in  the ˆx  direction. 
The  width  and  height  of  the  channel  are  W  and  D  respectively.  The  channel  passes  through   the  gap  of  a 
perfectly-permeable  C-core  of  width  T  in  the  ˆx  direction.  The  C-core  is  excited  by  a  perfectly-conducting 
N-turn  ﬁeld  coil  that  carries  the  current  iF  and  has  a  terminal  voltage  vF .  The  two  side  walls  of  the  channel 
make  perfect  electrical  contact  with  the  ﬂuid  over  the  width  T  as  the  channel  passes  through   the  C-core. 
The  current  through  these  armature  contacts  is  iA  and  the  voltage  across  them  is  vA .  A  two-dimensional 
view  of   the  MHD  generator  is  shown  in  Figure  9.
