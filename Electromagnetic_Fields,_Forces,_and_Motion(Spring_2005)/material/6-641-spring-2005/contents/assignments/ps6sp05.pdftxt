Problem 6.3 

An electric dipole having a z-directed moment p(t) is situated at the origin and at the center of a 
spherical cavity of free space having a radius R in a material having uniform H and V . When t < 
0,  p = 0 and there is no free charge anywhere. The dipole is a step function of time, 
instantaneously assuming a moment p0 when t = 0.

the cavity?

is the distribution of  ) ?
