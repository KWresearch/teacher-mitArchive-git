Problem 1.1 
 In Demonstration 1.4.1 the magnetic field strength is measured by a Hall effect probe. This probe 
works by the principle that when charges flow perpendicular to a magnetic field, the transverse 
displacement due to the Lorentz force can give rise to an electric field.

Figure  5-6    A  magnetic  field  perpendicular  to  a  current  flow  deflects  the 
charges  transversely  giving  rise  to  an  electric  field  and  the  Hall  voltage.    The 
polarity of the voltage is the same as the sign of the charge carriers.

 is in the positive y direction, while for negative charges as typically 
occur in metals or in n-type semiconductors, the charge velocity vy is negative. In the 
steady state, the charge velocity vy does not vary with time so the net force on the charges 
must be zero. What is the electric field (magnitude and direction) in terms of vy and Bo?

surface charge density, while at r = a there is perfectly conducting sheet with surface charge 
density that assures E = 0 for r > a. 
(a)  Determine E in the two regions r < b and b < r < a. 
(b) What is the surface charge density at r = a? 
(c)  What is the total charge in the regions r < b and b < r < a?  Including the surface charge 
at r = a, what is the total charge in the system?
