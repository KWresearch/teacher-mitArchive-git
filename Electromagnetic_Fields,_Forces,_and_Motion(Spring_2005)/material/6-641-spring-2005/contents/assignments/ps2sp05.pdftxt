(a)  Two line currents of infinite extent in the z direction are a distance d apart along the y-
axis.  The current I1 is located at y=d/2 and the current I2 is located at y=-d/2.  Find the 
magnetic field (magnitude and direction) at any point in the y=0 plane when the currents 
are: 

i)  I1=I, I2=0 
ii)  both equal, I1=I2=I 
iii)  of opposite direction but equal magnitude, I1=-I2=I.  This configuration is called a 
current line dipole with moment mx=Id.

Problem 2.3 

The curl and divergence operations have a simple relationship that will be used throughout the 
subject. 

(a)  One might be tempted to apply the divergence theorem to the surface integral in Stokes’ 
theorem. However, the divergence theorem requires a closed surface while Stokes’ 
theorem is true in general for an open surface. Stokes’ theorem for a closed surface 
requires the contour to shrink to zero giving a zero result for the line integral. Use the
