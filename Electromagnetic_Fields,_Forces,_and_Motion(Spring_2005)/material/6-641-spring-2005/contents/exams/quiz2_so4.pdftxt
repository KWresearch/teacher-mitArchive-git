Problem 1 

April 21, 2004 

Two parallel perfect conductors of depth D and spacing s enclose a perfectly conducting 
(σ→ ∞ ) block of width a and mass M that is free to move with negligible friction force in the x 
direction.  The block distance from the left hand edge of the parallel conductors is ξ.  The block 
is also constrained by a linear spring with spring constant K.  The spring exerts no force when 
ξ= 0  so that the spring force in the x direction is  f  = −Kξ.

Problem 2 

A magnetic circuit of depth D contains a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator with material 
of ohmic conductivity σ, magnetic permeability µ, width w and height h.  The MHD 
conducting material is moving at velocity  v V i
 .  The electrical terminals of the MHD machine 
= 
z 
is connected in series with a capacitor of capacitance C and with an N turn coil.  The voltage 
across the MHD machine terminals is  vMHD  , across the capacitor is  vC , and across the N turn coil 
is  vL  with polarities defined as shown in the figure below.
