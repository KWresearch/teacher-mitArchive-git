Problem 2 (30 points) 

The structure shown below is often used to determine the bending stiffness of thin films deposited 
during the fabrication of a MEMS device.  The structure is a thin film cantilever supported above a 
silicon substrate by an insulator.  When a voltage is applied between the cantilever and the substrate, the 
cantilever is attracted to the substrate and deflects downward.  Eventually, at a critical voltage, the 
deflection becomes unstable and the cantilever snaps down.  The stiffness of the cantilever is determined 
from this voltage.

Substrate 

To understand the behavior of the stiffness tester, model it as shown below.  Let the cantilever and 
substrate be modeled as a free-space parallel-plate capacitor with cross sectional area A.  The upper 
electrode has mass M.  Let the stiffness of the cantilever be modeled as a spring with spring constant K. 
When the capacitor is unexcited, and the spring is unstretched, the capacitor gap is G.  When voltage is 
applied across the capacitor, its upper plate moves toward its lower plate with displacement x as it 
stretches the spring.

a)	 Determine the force of electric origin that acts on the upper capacitor plate in the direction of 
increasing x, as a function of the applied voltage V, the plate deflection x, and the parameters of 
the model. 
b)	 Determine a differential equation that describes the time response of the deflection x as the upper 
capacitor plate is deflected by the force of electric origin.  Neglect gravity. 
c)	 Assume that the deflection of the upper capacitor plate is in static equilibrium for a given voltage 
V.  Determine a relation between the equilibrium deflection x=X, the applied voltage V, and the 
parameters of the model.  You need not explicitly solve for X. 
d)	 We wish to determine the voltage at which the equilibrium found in Part c becomes unstable.  To 
do so, let  x X x c  and linearize the differential equation found in Part b for small 
displacements  xc  from the equilibrium X, where  xc   X  . 
e)	 Combine the answers to Parts c and d to show that the deflection of the upper plate becomes 
unstable (as determined by the dynamics of the linearized differential equation found in Part d) 
when the upper plate deflects a fraction of the gap G.  Also, determine this fraction. 
f)	 Determine the voltage in terms of the parameters of the model at the onset of instability 
determined in Part e.

Depth d 

The above magnetic circuit of depth d has an infinitely magnetically permeable core  (Po f)  with two 
gaps of height a and b.  The right gap of height b and width  sb  is filled with a non-moving and non¬≠
conducting magnetic material with magnetic permeability Pb  .  The left gap of height a and width  sa  is 
partially filled with a non-conducting movable block of mass M and magnetic permeability Pa  and with 
an air gap with magnetic permeability P0  .  The distance that the Pa   material penetrates into the left air-
gap is x.  The Pa   movable block is also connected on its left hand side with a spring with spring 
constant K, that is fixed at its left end.  The spring exerts no force on the Pa  block when x=0.  The 
magnetic circuit has an N turn coil on its middle leg excited by a constant current I. 

a)  Find the magnetic field  H  in each gap within the magnetic circuit.  Neglect fringing field 
effects. 
b)  Find the self-inductance L(x) of the coil as a function of block position x.
