E 

Question:  Combine  the  answers  to  Parts  c  and  d  to  show  that  the  deﬂection  of  the  upper 
plate becomes  unstable (as determined by  the dynamics  of  the linearized diﬀerential  equation 
found  in  Part  d)  when  the  upper  plate  deﬂects  a  fraction  of  the  gap  G.  Also,  determine  this 
fraction. 

Solution:  Unstable if  G −  3X <  0.  Incipience:  X  =  G
