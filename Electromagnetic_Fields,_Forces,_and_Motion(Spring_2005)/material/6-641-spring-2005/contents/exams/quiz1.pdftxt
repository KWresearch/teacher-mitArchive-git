Problem 3 (35 points) 

This problem is concerned with computing the magnetic fields in the two systems shown below. 


(a)  Consider first the system shown in Figure 3.1.  	In this system, a surface current exists only in the 
plane z=0 and is everywhere surrounded by free space.  For x>0, the surface current is given by 
.  For x<0, the surface current is given by  K = −K i
=K K i
 
 
.  Which components of the 
0  y	
0  y 
magnetic field  H  do you expect to be non-zero in this system?  On which coordinates (x and/or 
y and/or z) do you expect the non-zero components to depend?  Explain briefly.
