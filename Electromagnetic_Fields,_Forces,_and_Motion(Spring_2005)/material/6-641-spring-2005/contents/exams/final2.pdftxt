An electrical transmission line of length  A  has characteristic impedance  Z 0  .  Electromagnetic

A perfectly conducting membrane of depth D with mass per unit area σm  and tension S is a 
distance h above a rigid perfect conductor.  The membrane and rigid conductor are in free space 
x t  = 0 , the static uniform 
and support currents such that when the membrane is flat, ξ( , )  
magnetic field intensity is  H 0 .  As the membrane deforms, the flux through the region between 
membrane and rigid conductor is conserved.  The system is in a downward gravity field with 
gravitational acceleration  g = − g iz .  The membrane deflection has no dependence on y and is 
fixed at its two ends at x = 0 and  x = A .

displacement ξ( x, ) t  , what is the z directed magnetic force per unit area, Fz, on the 
membrane?

membrane at x = 0 and  x = A .  What are the allowed values for k?

are the natural frequencies and if unstable what are the growth rates of the instability?
