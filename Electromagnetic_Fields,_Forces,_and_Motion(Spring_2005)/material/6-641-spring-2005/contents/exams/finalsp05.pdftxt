A lossy dielectric cylinder of radius R1, dielectric permittivity H, and ohmic conductivity V is 
uniformly charged at time t=0 with free volume charge density Uf  (t  0)
 U0 .  The charged 
dielectric cylinder is surrounded by free space with permittivity H0  and zero conductivity, and 
the free space is surrounded by a grounded coaxial perfectly conducting cylinder of radius R2. 
The electric field for r>R2 is zero.  The depth d of the cylinder is very large so that fringing 
fields can be neglected. 

a)  What are the volume charge density and electric field within the inner cylinder as a 
function of time? 
b)  What is the electric field in the free space region, R1<r<R2, as a function of time? 
c)  What are the surface charge densities on the interfaces at r=R1 and r=R2 as a function of 
time?

Tall buildings with a steel structure often vibrate under wind loadings and means must be used to 
control the displacements in the structure. It is proposed to use an electromagnetic device to 
control these vibrations. 

A simple version of such a device is shown in the figure below. A highly permeable cylindrical 
magnetic structure with permeability Po f  has a coil of N 0   turns with a DC current  I 0  that 
produces a magnetic field in the gap of width g. A concentrated coil of N turns carrying a current 
i is mounted on a sliding mechanism that allows it to move with displacement G as shown.  For 
purposes of this analysis assume that the free-space gap is small,  g  R , and that the field in the 
gap is purely in the radial direction but does not significantly vary with the radial coordinate r.

A  perfectly  conducting  membrane  with  equilibrium  tension  per  unit  depth  S  and  mass  per  unit 
area V m  is  stretched  horizontally  and  fixed  at  two  rigid  supports  a  distance  L  apart.    The  
membrane is grounded so that its voltage is zero.  Parallel plate electrodes are placed a distance a 
above  and  below  the  membrane.    The  upper  electrode  is  put  at  voltage  –V1  and  the  lower 
electrode  is  put  at  voltage  +V0.  The  region  surrounding  the  membrane  is  free  space  with 
permittivity H0  .  Assume  that  transverse  displacements  of  the  membrane  only  depend  on  x  and 
not y.  Membrane displacements are in the “long-wave limit” so that the electric fields above and
