Problem 1 (20 points) 

The two figures shown below present two different views of a magnetohydrodynamic generator. 
In this generator, a fluid having conductivity σ and free-space permeability is pumped through a 
rectangular channel with velocity U in the  xˆ  direction. The width and height of the channel are 
W and D, respectively. The channel passes through the gap of a perfectly-permeable C-core of 
width T in the  xˆ  direction. The C-core is excited by a perfectly-conducting N-turn field coil that 
carries the current  iF  and has a terminal voltage  vF .  The two side walls of the channel make 
perfect electrical contact with the fluid over the width T as the channel passes through the C-
core. The current through these armature contacts is  iA  and the voltage across them is  vA  .

A fluid having conductivity σ and permittivity ε fills the space above a plane of electrodes to a 
depth  ∆  as shown above. The electrodes are excited so as to support a wave of potential that 
travels in the  zˆ  direction with amplitude Vˆ , temporal frequency ω and spatial wavenumber k. 
This electrical excitation pumps the fluid so that its interface with the free space at  x = ∆  travels 
with velocity U in the  zˆ  direction.  Assume that the system operates in the sinusoidal steady 
state so that the electric potential in the fluid and free space regions take the form

A string of mass m per unit length and uniform tension T has a uniformly distributed line 
charge λ Coulombs/meter over its length  A .  The charged string is placed a distance s below 
a perfectly conducting ground plane and is surrounded by free space.  The string supports 
small signal displacements ξ( x, t )  and is fixed at x=0.  At  x = −A  the string is tied to a linear 
spring with spring constant K.  The point where the string and spring are tied together can 
only move vertically.  The spring exerts no force when ξ( x = −A, t ) = 0  so that the force 
 = −A, t ) .  Gravity acts downwards. 
exerted by the spring is  − ξ(K x
