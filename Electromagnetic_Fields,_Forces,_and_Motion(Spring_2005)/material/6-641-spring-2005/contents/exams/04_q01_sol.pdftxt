Problem  1 

A 

Question:  What is the general form of  the solution for  χ(x, y) in the regions  x <  0  and  0  < x < d? 

Solution: 

χ(x, y) = 

� 
A cos(ay)e ax 
B cos(ay) cosh (a  (x  −  d)) 

x <  0 
0 < x < d 

B 

Question:  What  boundary  conditions  must  be  satisﬁed? 

Solution: 

Hy (x  = 0+ ) −  Hy (x  = 0 − ) =  Kz

µHx (x  = 0 − ) =  µ0Hx (x  = 0+ )

Hx (x  =  d) = 0


C 

Question:  Solve  χ(x, y)  for  x <  0  and  0  < x < d.

Hint:  To  minimize  algebraic  complexity,  think  about  the  best  way  to  write  the  general  form

of  the  solution  for  χ(x, y)  to  automatically  satisfy  one  of  the boundary  conditions for part (b).


Solution: 

Hy  =  −
