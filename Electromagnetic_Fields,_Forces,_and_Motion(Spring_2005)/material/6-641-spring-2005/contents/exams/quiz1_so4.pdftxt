A current sheet  K K 0  sin ay i
  is placed at x=0 between magnetic material with permeability µ and
=
z 
free space with magnetic permeability µ  where  a > 0 .  A perfectly conducting plane of infinite extent 
0
in the y and z directions is placed at x=d.  Because there are no volume currents for  x < 0  and  0 < x < d  , 
in these regions a scalar potential can be defined such that  H  = −∇χ.  Assume that there are no field 
dependencies on the z coordinate. 

a)  What is the general form of the solution for  χ x y )  in the regions  x < 0  and  0 < < d  .

b)  What boundary conditions must be satisfied? 
c)  Solve for  χ x y )  for  x < 0  and  0 < x < d  .

Hint: To minimize algebraic complexity, think about the best way to write the general form of the 
solution for  χ x y )  to automatically satisfy one of the boundary conditions for part (b).

d)  What is the surface current that flows on the x=d interface? 
e)  What is the force per unit y-z area on the x=d interface?
