Problem  1


Figure  1:  A  potential  sheet  between  two  lossless  dielectrics  with  a  perfect  conductor  placed  at  x  =  s. 

A  potential  sheet  of  inﬁnite  extent  in  the  y  and  z  directions  is  placed  at  x  =  0  and  has  potential 
distribution Φ(x  = 0, y) =  V0 cos(ky).  Free space with  no conductivity (σ  = 0)  and permittivity  �0  is present 
for  x <  0  while  for  0  < x < s  a perfectly insulating dielectric (σ  =  0)  with  permittivity  �  is  present.  The 
region for  x >  s  is  a  grounded  perfect  conductor  at  zero  potential.

Figure  2:  Parallel  plate  electrodes 

Parallel plate electrodes with  spacing  h  and depth  D  are excited by  a DC  current  source  I . An elastic rod 
surrounded  by  free  space  has  mass  density  ρ,  modulus  of  elasticity  E ,  equilibrium  length  l  and has inﬁnite 
ohmic  conductivity  σ .  The  elastic  rod  end  at  x  = 0  is  ﬁxed  while  the  deﬂections  of  the  rod  are  described  as 
δ(x, t) and  are  assumed  small  |δ(x, t)| � l.  The  rod  width  l − δ(−l, t) changes  as  I  is  changed  because  of  the 
magnetic  force.  The  DC  current  ﬂows  as  a  surface  current  on  the  x  =  −(l  − δ(−l, t))  end  of  the  perfectly 
conducting  rod.

Problem  3

Figure  3:  An  electrical  transmission  line 

An  electrical  transmission  line  of  length  l  has  characteristic  impedance  Z0 .  Electromagnetic  waves  can 
travel  on  the  line  at  speed  c,  so  that  the  time  to  travel  one-way  over  the  line  length  l  is  T  =  l
c  .  The line is 
matched  at  z  =  0  and  is  short  circuited  at  z  =  l.  At  time  t  =  0,  a  lightning  bolt  strikes  the  entire  line  so 
that  there  is  a  uniform  current  along  the  line  but  with  zero  voltage: 

i(z , t  = 0)  =  I0 
v(z , t  = 0)  = 0 

0  < z < l 
0  < z < l 

Since  the  voltage  and  current  obey  the  telegrapher’s  relations:

Problem  4 

6.641,  Spring  2005 

Figure  6:  A  perfectly  conducting  membrane  stressed  from  below  by  magnetic  ﬁeld  H0 ix 

A  perfectly  conducting  membrane  of  depth  D  with  mass  per  unit  area  σm  and tension  S  is  a  distance  h 
above  a  rigid  perfect  conductor.  The  membrane  and  rigid  conductor  are  in  free  space  and  support  currents 
such  that  when  the  membrane  is  ﬂat,  ξ (x, t) =  0,  the  static  uniform  magnetic  ﬁeld  intensity  is  H0 .  As  the 
membrane  deforms,  the  ﬂux  through  the  region  between  membrane  and  rigid  conductor  is  conserved.  The 
system  is  in  a  downward  gravity  ﬁeld  with  gravitational  acceleration  ¯g  =  −g i¯z .  The  membrane  deﬂection 
has  no  dependence  on  y  and  is  ﬁxed  at  its  two  ends  at  x  = 0  and  x  =  l. 

A 
Question:  Assuming  that  ξ (x, t) � h  and  that  the  only  signiﬁcant  magnetic  ﬁeld  component  is 
x  directed, how is  Hx (x, t)  approximately  related  to  ξ (x, t)  to  linear  terms  in  ξ (x, t)?
