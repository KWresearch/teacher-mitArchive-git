The figure illustrates a magnetic yoke with infinite permeability; and an air gap with 
magnetic permeability P0  , length g, and cross-sectional area  Dw . An incompressible block with 
length  l !! D , magnetic permeability P and cross-sectional area  wg can move in the x direction 
as shown. Both the magnetic block and the yoke can be assumed to have negligible electrical 
conductivity. There is an N turn winding around the magnetic yoke driven by a DC current 
source I0. Assume throughout that the position x of the moveable block is bounded as  0 d d  Dx
. 

(a)  Find the flux linkage (O) â€“ current (i) relationship for the winding in terms of x, P, P0 , N and 
the dimensions of the magnetic circuit. 
(b)  Find the force in the x direction on the incompressible block due to the current source I0.

(c)  If the magnetic block is forced to move with a displacement given by 	x

find the voltage developed across the current source. 
(d)  The current source and the block position are controlled to traverse the i â€“ x plane in a cycle 
as shown. Find the work done by the current source for each cycle.
