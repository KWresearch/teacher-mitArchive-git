***** Course Meeting Times *****
Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session
Recitations: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session
***** Course Staff *****
Lecturer: Prof. Markus Zahn
Recitation Instructor: Prof. Gerald L. Wilson
***** Description *****
6.641 examines electric and magnetic quasistatic forms of Maxwell's equations
applied to dielectric, conduction, and magnetization boundary value problems.
Topics covered include: electromagnetic forces, force densities, and stress
tensors, including magnetization and polarization; thermodynamics of
electromagnetic fields, equations of motion, and energy conservation;
applications to synchronous, induction, and commutator machines; sensors and
transducers; microelectromechanical systems; propagation and stability of
electromechanical waves; and charge transport phenomena.
***** Prerequisites *****
The prerequisite for the courseÂ is 6.013 Electromagnetics and Applications.
***** General Guidelines *****
**** Text ****
Lecture notes will present most of the course material. Required subject texts
are texts 1 and 2 below. Text 3 is not required but may be useful as a
supplementary text.

**** Homework ****
A homework set will generally be handed out in the first lecture each week and
is due in the second lecture of the following week (9 days later). No late
homeworks will be accepted. For extenuating circumstances contact Prof. Zahn.
**** Classes ****
Lectures will be twice weekly. Recitations are tentatively twice a week but may
be rescheduled to accommodate the schedules of all interested students. There
will also be scheduled a one-hour homework review session each week.
**** Exams ****
Two evening quizzes are scheduled for two hours each. There will also be a
Final Examination. A formula sheet that each student prepares will be allowed
during all quizzes and the Final Exam. A standard 6.641 formula sheet will also
be supplied. In compliance with Institute rules, on quiz days the recitation
will be cancelled, but an optional quiz review will be given during the class
time.
**** Grades ****
The grades in the course will be given with the following assigned weights:
        Grading criteria.
ACTIVITIES             PERCENTAGES
Two one-hour quizzes   40%
Final exam             35%
Homework and tutorials 25%
Total                  100%
Â 
**** Note ****
The homework is an extremely important part of the subject. Students are
allowed to work together on homework assignments but each person must do their
own thinking and prepare their own homework. Quiz and final exam problems will
be analogous to homework problems.
**** Demonstrations ****
The course will have many physical demonstrations that are shown in lectures
and recitations. For further study, many of the demonstrations are available in
Supplemental_Resources.
