***** Electromagnetic_Fields_and_Energy_with_Video_Demonstrations *****
This text is aimed at those who have seen Maxwell's equations in integral and
differential form and who have been exposed to some integral theorems and
differential operators. The accompanying video demonstrations help the student
connect what is analytically derived with what is observed.

and Energy. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1989. ISBN: 9780132490207.
***** Electromechanical_Dynamics *****
This text explains electromechanical dynamics, a subject that combines
classical mechanics with the fundamentals of electricity and magnetism. Some of
the examples include rotating machinery, plasma dynamics, electromechanics of
biological systems, and magnetoelasticity. The examples used are mathematically
lucid and physically demonstrable.

Electromechanical Dynamics. Malabar, FL: Krieger Pub. Co., 1985. ISBN:
9780898748475.
***** Electromagnetic_Field_Theory *****
This text is an introduction at the junior level to electromagnetic field
theory. The course starts with the Coulomb-Lorentz force law on a point charge.
The theory is extended by the continuous superposition of solutions from
previously developed simpler problems leading to the general integral and
differential field laws. This book features many worked examples emphasizing
physical processes, devices, and models.
