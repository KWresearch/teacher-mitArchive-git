1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,030

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:07,400
SPEAKER 1: Hi.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,000
Welcome back to recitation.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,310
In class, you've been learning
about convergence tests for

5
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,100
infinite series of constants.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,020
So I have here three examples
of infinite series--

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,476
SPEAKER 2: Cut.

8
00:00:19,476 --> 00:00:20,844
Can we just start that again?

9
00:00:20,844 --> 00:00:23,130
I didn't like the way
you hesitated.

10
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:23,561
SPEAKER 1: OK.

11
00:00:23,561 --> 00:00:25,720
SPEAKER 2: Minor point,
but [INAUDIBLE]

12
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,720
SPEAKER 1: Sure.

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,631
SPEAKER 2: I'll give you
another countdown.

14
00:00:28,631 --> 00:00:31,620
SPEAKER 3: Wait, infinite
series of constants?

15
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,030
SPEAKER 1: Yeah?

16
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,464
No?

17
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:38,670
SPEAKER 3: It makes me think
3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3.

18
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,810
SPEAKER 1: As opposed to
infinite series of functions.

19
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,010
I can just say infinite
series.

20
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,260
OK.

21
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:56,210

22
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:56,680
Hi.

23
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,220
Welcome back to recitation.

24
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,780
In class, you've been learning
about convergence tests for

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,800
infinite series.

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,050
I have here three examples of
series that I happen to like.

27
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,510
So the first one is the sum from
n equals 0 to infinity of

28
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,160
5n plus 2 divided by
n cubed plus 1.

29
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,550
The second one is the sum from
n equals 1 to infinity of the

30
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,590
quantity 1 plus the square root
of 5 over 2, all that to

31
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,630
the nth power.

32
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,590
And the third one is the sum
from n equals 1 to infinity of

33
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,290
the natural log of n divided
by n squared.

34
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,500
So what I'd like you to do for
each of these three series is

35
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,290
to figure out whether or
not they converge.

36
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:35,580
So whether they converge,
or whether they diverge.

37
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,620
So why don't you pause the
video, take some time to work

38
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,800
that out, come back, and we
can work on it together.

39
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:48,920

40
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,640
Welcome back.

41
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,130
Hopefully you had some luck
working on these series.

42
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,920
So let's talk about
how we do them.

43
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,970
So I'll start with the
first one here.

44
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,232
So this first one, the function
that we're, that

45
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:05,900
we're summing is this 5n plus
2 divided by n cubed plus 3.

46
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,450
And so you want to know, does
that sum of that expression,

47
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,410
of n goes from 1 to infinity,
does that converge?

48
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,900
Does it reach some
finite value?

49
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,380
Or does it diverge?

50
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,160
Does it either, you know,
oscillate, or go to infinity,

51
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,720
or something like that?

52
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,580
So for one thing you can always
do, is something like a

53
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,710
comparison test. And so what you
want to do there, is you

54
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,010
want to extract the information
from the

55
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,800
expression for the summand.

56
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,700
You want to figure out, you
know, about how big this is.

57
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,540
What are the important
parts of it?

58
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,250
So in this case, you
have a ratio.

59
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,850
And so when you have a ratio,
what you want to do, is you

60
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,820
want to look at what's the
magnitude of the top, and

61
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,410
what's the magnitude
of the bottom.

62
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,540
So roughly speaking, the
magnitude of the top is of the

63
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,000
order of n.

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,290
Right?

65
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,800
It's 5n.

66
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,750
The 5 is just a constant
multiple.

67
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,220
That's not going to make
a whole big difference.

68
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,190
And the plus 2 is just much,
much, much smaller than the n

69
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,080
when n gets very, very large.

70
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,680
So the, we can say that the
order of magnitude of the top

71
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,070
here is of the order of n, and
similarly, the order of

72
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,000
magnitude of the bottom is
of the order of n cubed.

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,240
Right?

74
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,210
The plus 1 is much, much, much
smaller than the n cubed, so

75
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,000
it's not, it's almost
insignificant.

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,580
So roughly speaking, we should
expect this to be of the same

77
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,760
behavior as if we just
had n over n cubed,

78
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,410
which is 1 over n squared.

79
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,850
And we know that 1 over n
squared, the series 1 over n

80
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,000
squared from n equals 1 to
infinity, converges.

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,340
So that's sort of just
a sort of a way of

82
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,080
thinking about this.

83
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,060
And we can formalize it using
the limit comparison test.

84
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:52,560
So the idea here for part A is
to use the limit comparison

85
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,070
test. So what we want
to compute--

86
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,820
so I'm going to put a 5 in.

87
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,190
So I'm going to make it 5 over
n squared, because we

88
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,940
had this 5 up here.

89
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:10,080
So we have an is equal to 5n
plus 2 over n cubed plus 1.

90
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,600
And I want to limit
compare it with--

91
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:24,350
I'm going to compare my series
with the series sum from n

92
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,460
equals 1 to infinity of
5 over n squared.

93
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,180
Now--

94
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,970
I'm talking about
this 5, right?

95
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,190
This 5 doesn't matter.

96
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,580
If this series-- if 1 over n
squared, that sum converges

97
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,350
then 5 over n squared, that
sum converges to exactly 5

98
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,130
times as much.

99
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,210
And if, you know, if I wrote a
divergent thing here, and then

100
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,530
multiplied it by 5, the
result multiplied by

101
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,730
5 would still diverge.

102
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,630
So this constant multiple
isn't going to matter.

103
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,150
And I'm just choosing, I'm just
putting the 5 in there

104
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,890
because of this 5 we
saw over here.

105
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,590
So OK.

106
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,700
So let's select work
it out, then.

107
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,810
So the limit comparison
test says--

108
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:07,240
so we look at the limit as n
goes to infinity of the ratio

109
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,250
of the two things that
we're interested in.

110
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,420
So in this case, this is 5n and
plus 2 over n cubed plus

111
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,950
1, divided by 5 over
n squared.

112
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:20,500
And you can--

113
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:20,680
OK.

114
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,660
So this is a ratio of two
ratios, so we can rewrite it

115
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,200
by multiplying upstairs, and we
get that this is equal to

116
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:37,670
the limit as n goes to infinity
of 5n cubed plus 2 n

117
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,620
squared over 5n cubed plus 5.

118
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,800
And so we've seen before, when
we were dealing with limits,

119
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,610
that when you have a ratio of
two polynomials, as the

120
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,560
variable goes to infinity, the
limit is what you get just by

121
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,340
comparing the leading terms. So
in this case, we just have

122
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,570
to look at 5n cubed over 5n
cubed, and that's indeed 1.

123
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,700
OK, so this is 1.

124
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:08,050
So by the limit comparison test,
our series, the sum of

125
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,230
this an, converges if and only
if this series converges.

126
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,340
And we already said
that we know sum 1

127
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,020
over n squared converges.

128
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,550
So by the limit comparison
test, since sum 1 over n

129
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,320
squared converges, our
series converges.

130
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,630

131
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,140
Great.

132
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:26,550
OK.

133
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,870
So that's the first one.

134
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,930
Let's look at the second one.

135
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,450
So the second one here is the
sum from n equals 1 to

136
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,520
infinity of 1 plus the square
root of 5 over 2.

137
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,720
That whole thing to
the nth power.

138
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,100
Now, if you look at this, the
thing you should recognize

139
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,450
this as, is just a particular
geometric series.

140
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:46,860
Right?

141
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,090
This is, if you were to replace
1 plus the square root

142
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,842
of 5 over 2 with x, this is just
x plus x squared plus x

143
00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:55,890
cubed plus dot dot
dot dot dot.

144
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,800
It's just a geometric series
with constant ratio--

145
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,620
well, x .

146
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,760
1 plus the square root
of 5 over 2.

147
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:07,510
So we know exactly when
geometric series converge.

148
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:13,400
They converge exactly when the
constant ratio is between

149
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,630
minus 1 and 1.

150
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,250
So bigger than minus
1 and less than 1.

151
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,570
So this series converges, then,
if and only if 1 plus

152
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,520
the square root of 5 over 2
is between minus 1 and 1.

153
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,300
So then we just have to think
about, is this number between

154
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,980
minus 1 and 1.

155
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,970
And OK.

156
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,400
So this is not that
hard to do.

157
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,520
Square root of 5 is bigger than
2, so 1 plus the square

158
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,100
root of 5 is bigger than 3, so
1 plus the square root of 5

159
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,460
over 2 is bigger than 3/2.

160
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,140
So 3/2 is bigger than 1.

161
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:45,590
So this common ratio in this
series is bigger than 1.

162
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,630
So the terms of this series
are blowing ip.

163
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:51,070
You know, when you, when n gets
bigger and bigger, you're

164
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,700
adding larger and larger
numbers here.

165
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,540
This is blowing up.

166
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,790
It's a divergent geometric
series.

167
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,175
So this series does
not converge.

168
00:07:57,175 --> 00:08:03,570
So b, I'll just write
that here.

169
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:16,430
B diverges, because it's
geometric with common ratio

170
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,480
bigger than 1.

171
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,890
So that's the reason that
part B diverges.

172
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,250
Finally, we're left
with question C.

173
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,330
So I'm going to come over and
write it over here again, so

174
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:27,850
we can see it.

175
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:38,390
So part C asks the sum for n
equals 1 to infinity of log n

176
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,640
over n squared.

177
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,360

178
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,270
So this one's a little trickier,
and it requires a

179
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:44,906
little bit more thought.

180
00:08:44,906 --> 00:08:46,156
The thing to-- do let's
start just by--

181
00:08:46,156 --> 00:08:51,490

182
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,440
it can't be solved just by a
straightforward application of

183
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,740
the limit comparison test
that we've learned.

184
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,870
So we need to think a little bit
more about what ways could

185
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:04,690
we solve it.

186
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,400
So one thing to remember here
is, is we should think about,

187
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,450
what are the magnitudes
of these things?

188
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,530
So we know that sum 1 over
n squared converges.

189
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,640
But log n is a function
that grows.

190
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,410
So this individual term is
bigger than 1 over n squared.

191
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,620
So we can't just compare
it to 1 over n squared.

192
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,010
But log n grows very,
very slowly.

193
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:27,880
How slowly?

194
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,910
Well, it grows more slowly
than any power of x.

195
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,440
Right?

196
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,200
So, or-- sorry-- any power of
n in this case, because the

197
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,720
variable is n.

198
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:46,750
So if you remember, we know,
we've shown, that the limit of

199
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:59,010
ln x over x to the p as x goes
to infinity is equal to 0 for

200
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,440
any positive p.

201
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:08,420
So ln, log n, ln n, is going to
infinity, but it's going to

202
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,540
infinity much slower than
any power of n.

203
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,390
In this case.

204
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,660
Or x, down here.

205
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,700
So OK.

206
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,860
So what does that mean?

207
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:21,070
Well, one thing you could do,
is you could say, oh, OK.

208
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,980
So ln n over n, that's
getting really small.

209
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,260
And then what we're left
with is 1 over n.

210
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,050
So you can say, OK.

211
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,030
So this is much smaller
than 1 over n.

212
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:34,480
The problem is that the
sum 1 over n diverges.

213
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:34,830
Yeah?

214
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,630
So that doesn't help
us, really, right?

215
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:41,620
So we've shown this is bigger
than the sum 1 over n squared,

216
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,430
which converges, and it's
smaller than the sum 1 over n,

217
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,570
which diverges.

218
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,160
But that still doesn't
tell us, you know?

219
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,590
It could be something that,
you know, there's a lot of

220
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,390
room bigger than a particular
convergent series, and smaller

221
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,130
than a particular divergent
series.

222
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,800
And in particular, there are
both convergent and divergent

223
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,950
series in between.

224
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,450
So we still need, we need
either something that

225
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,220
converges that our thing is
less than, or we need

226
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,560
something that diverges that
our thing is bigger than.

227
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:10,760
Right?

228
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,960
If we can bound our series above
by something convergent,

229
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,470
then our series converges.

230
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,250
Because [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

231
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,330
has positive terms.
This is important.

232
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,390
Or if we can bound it below by
something that diverges, then

233
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,830
we would know it diverges.

234
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,090
And so far, we haven't
been able to do that.

235
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:30,955
But maybe we can think of a-- so
I said we could write this,

236
00:11:30,955 --> 00:11:35,490
a second ago, I said we could
write ln n over n squared is

237
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:40,420
equal to ln n and over
n times 1 over n.

238
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:44,280
So that was what we just said
a minute ago, at which we

239
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:49,220
showed is eventually
less than 1 over n.

240
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,150
So this is true, but it wasn't
useful, because the sum 1 over

241
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,830
n diverges.

242
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,070
But maybe we can, we can
do something even

243
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:57,800
a little more tricky.

244
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,540
Because here we saw that x, we
could use it in the base, we

245
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,350
could use any power of the
variable, any positive power.

246
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,070
So here, we tried it with
the power n to the 1.

247
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,260
We tried to split this 2 as 1
plus 1, and we kept one of the

248
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,940
n's to knock out the log
n, and we kept the

249
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,620
other n over here.

250
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,060
But we don't need a whole
power of n to

251
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,210
knock out the log n.

252
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:24,180
Any positive power
of n would do.

253
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,760
So in particular, we could split
this using, say, just a

254
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,550
small power of n, even smaller
than the first power here, and

255
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,050
leave more of it over here.

256
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:43,260
So we also know, we also have
that ln n over n squared is

257
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:48,180
equal to, for example,
ln n over--

258
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:54,230
well, you know, for example,
n to the 1/2 times 1

259
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,180
over n to the 3/2.

260
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:03,980
And now we know that ln n over
n to the 1/2 goes to 0 as n

261
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,780
gets large.

262
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,610
So this is thing is
getting smaller

263
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,650
and smaller and smaller.

264
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:12,520
So as this gets smaller, we have
that this has to be less

265
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,130
than 1 over n to the 3/2.

266
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:20,240
So this thing that we're adding
up here is smaller than

267
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,150
1 over n to the 3/2.

268
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,550
Well, what's the significance
of that?

269
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,600
Well, we know 1 over n to the
3/2, that series converges.

270
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,330
Yeah?

271
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:35,990
We know the sum 1 over n to
the 3/2 from n equals 1 to

272
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:43,050
infinity converges, because
3/2 is bigger than 1.

273
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:43,620
OK?

274
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,370
So what does that mean?

275
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,130
Well, we have our series, and
we've shown that the terms of

276
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,660
our series are eventually
bounded below 1

277
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,290
over n to the 3/2.

278
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,150
And we know that the sum of 1
over n to the 3/2 converges,

279
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,000
so our series is bounded above
by a convergent series.

280
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,510
So whenever you have a series
bounded above, a series of

281
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,850
non-negative terms bounded
above, by a convergent series,

282
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,460
that means your series
also has to converge.

283
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,388
OK, so this converges.

284
00:14:13,388 --> 00:14:16,230
So it converges by a comparison

285
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,340
to this other series.

286
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,980
Using this cute trick that we
can replace a log with any

287
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,840
small positive power of n that
happens to be convenient.

288
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,290
And of course, if you wanted to,
maybe you could have made

289
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,540
this 1/2 a 1/10 and that would
have been fine, or you

290
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,720
could've even made it a 9/10,
and then you would here be

291
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,280
left with n to the 11/10, and
that would still be OK.

292
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:42,030
Because that would be 11/10, and
11/10, then it would still

293
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,540
be bigger than 1.

294
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,900
All right.

295
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,810
So this is a nice use of a, of
a comparison test. We didn't

296
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,300
use exactly the limit comparison
test as it was

297
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,220
described in lecture, but it's a
very closely related process

298
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,020
that we went through to show
that this second series--

299
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,540
sorry, this third series--

300
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,480
also converges.

301
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,330
So I'll end there.

302
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:04,571
