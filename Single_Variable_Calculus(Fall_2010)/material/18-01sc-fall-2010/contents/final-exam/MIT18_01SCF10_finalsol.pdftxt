1. (1a) By the product rule,
(x3ex )(cid:48) = 3x2ex + x3ex = ex (3x2 + x3 ).

(1b) If f (x) = sin(2x), then
f (7) (x) = −128 cos(2x)

since:

f (1) (x) = 2 cos(2x)

f (2) (x) = −4 sin(2x)

f (3) (x) = −8 cos(2x)

f (4) (x) = 16 sin(2x)

f (5) (x) = 32 cos(2x)

f (6) (x) = −64 sin(2x)

f (7) (x) = −128 cos(2x)
2. (2a) The line tangent to y = 3x2 − 5x + 2 at x = 2 has a slope equal
to that of the curve at x = 2 and passes through the point (2, 4).
The slope of the line at x = 2 is y (cid:48) (x = 2) = 6x − 5 = 6(2) − 5 = 7 = m.
The y-intercept of the line, b, is found by using the slope and the known
− b
⇒ b = −10.

The equation of the line is therefore
y = mx + b = 7x − 10.

point:

= 7

(2b) If the curve had a horizontal tangent, then at some point the ﬁrst
derivative of y with respect to x would be equal to zero.
The derivative of the equation xy 3 + x3y = 4 is

1

y 3 + x(3y 2 )y (cid:48) + 3x2y + y (cid:48)x3 = 0 ⇒ y (cid:48) (x3y 2 + x3 ) = −y 3 − 3x2y .
−y
− 3x2y
⇒ −y 3 − 3x2y = 0. This
If y (cid:48) were
to 0, then
equal
= 0
x3y 2 + x3
equation is valid when both x and y are zero or when y 3 = −3x2y for nonzero
x and y .
The ﬁrst case is not valid, because we are given that xy 3 + x3y = 4, which
would not be possible if x and y were both zero.
The second case is also impossible, because y 3 = −3x2y ⇒ y 2 = −3x2 (we
can divide by y because in this case it must be nonzero) and it is not possible
for the ratio of two squares (necessarily positive numbers) to be equal to a
negative number.
Therefore y (cid:48) can never be zero and so the curve deﬁned by xy 3 + x3y = 4
has no horizontal tangents.

5. The values x and y are deﬁned as in the ﬁgure below:

3

The area of printed type = 50 in2 , so xy = 50 and the total area of the
poster is (x + 4)(y + 8). To minimize the amount of paper used, we need to
minimize the total area of the poster.

(x + 4)(y + 8) = xy + 4y + 8x + 32 = 82 + 4y + 8x

since we know that xy = 50.
We can also substitute y = 50/x, so that we have an area equal to:

4(50)
x
To ﬁnd the minimum of this equation we set the ﬁrst derivative with
respect to x equal to zero:

+ 8x.

82 +

⇒

x = 5,

⇒

+ 8 = 0

x2 = 25

We can check that x = 5 corresponds to a minimum of the area by taking
the second derivative of − 200

3 . Since this is positive at x = 5,

x
the point does indeed correspond to a minimum.
If x = 5 then xy = 50 ⇒ y = 10. Thus the dimensions of the poster which
minimize the amount of paper used are a = x + 4 = 9 in and b = y + 8 = 18
in.

6. Let y be the total distance from the plane to the car, and let x be
the horizontal distance between the plane and the car. The question asks for
dc/dt, the car’s speed.

√
From the Pythagorean theorem, y = x2 + 1, because the plane is a
addition, since y = 3/2 at t = 0, we know that x = (cid:112)y 2 − 1 = 5 at t = 0.

be approximately as follows:

The areas of the regions are then:
Region I: (3 − 1)y(1) = 2y(1) = 2(2.7) = 5.4
Region II: (5 − 3)y(3) = 2y(3) = 2(6.7) = 13.4
Region III: (.5)(3 − 1)(y(3) − y(1)) = y(3) − y(1) = 6.7 − 2.7 = 4
Region IV:(.5)(5 − 3)(y(5) − y(3)) = y(5) − y(3) = 29.7 − 6.7 = 23
And the total area is then 45.8 units2 .

(12a) It is given that the rate of radioactive decay of a mass of
12.
Radium-226, dm/dt, is proportional to the amount m of Radium present at
time t. We can then write

= Am,

where A is a constant. Re-writing and integrating the equation,

At + C (cid:48)
ln(m) =
m = eAt+C (cid:48)
= eAteC (cid:48)
m = C eAt

9

where C is a constant. We can ﬁnd A and C by using the information
given in the problem. First, we know that there are 100 mg of Radium
present at t = 0, so that

m(t = 0) = C = 100 mg.

We also know that it takes 1600 years for m to decrease by half. Therefore:

Finally,

(50/100) = .5 = e1600A
ln(.5) = 1600A
A = ln(.5)/1600.

m = C eAt
= 100e(ln(.5)/1600)t
= 100(eln(.5) )t/1600
= 100(.5)t/1600 ,

where t is in years and m(t) is in mg.

(12b) When t = 1000 years, and using the approximation given in the
question,

m = 100(.5)1000/1600
= 100(2)−10/16
≈ 100(.65)
= 65mg.
