Be sure to identify in writing all local maxs and mins, regions where the function is 
increasing/decreasing,  points  of  inﬂection,  symmetries,  and  vertical  or  horizontal 
asymptotes  (if  any  of  these  behaviors  occur). 

5.  A poster  is  to  be  designed with  50  in2  of  printed  type,  4  inch margins  on both  the 
top  and  the  bottom,  and  2  inch margins  on  each  side.  Find  the  dimensions  of  the 
poster  which  minimize  the  amount  of  paper  used.  (Be  sure  to  indicate  why  the 
answer  you  found  is  a minimum.) 

6.  A  highway  patrol  plane  is  ﬂying  1 mile  above  a  long,  straight  road,  with  constant 
ground  speed  of  120  m.p.h.  Using  radar,  the  pilot  detects  a  car  whose  distance 
from  the  plane  is  1.5 miles  and  decreasing  at  a  rate  of  136 m.p.h.  How  fast  is  the

make  a  sphere.  Then  a  hole  of  diameter  a  is  bored  through  the  sphere  along  the 
y -axis  (from  north  to  south  pole,  like  a  cored  apple).  Find  the  volume  of  the 
resulting  “cored”  sphere.  (Hint:  Draw  a  picture  of  the  two-dimensional  region  to 
be  revolved,  and  label  parts  of  your  picture  to  help  set  up  the  integration.)

are  computing,  divided  into  two  trapezoids.) 

12.  The  rate  of  radioactive  decay  of  a  mass  of  Radium-226  (call  it  dm/dt)  is  propor­
tional  to  the  amount m  of  Radium  present  at  time  t.  Suppose  we  begin  with  100 
milligrams  of  Radium  at  time  t = 0. 

(a)  Given  that  the  half  life  of  Radium-226  is  roughly  1600  years  (half  life  is  the 
time  it  takes  for  the  mass  to  decay  by  half ),  ﬁnd  a  formula  for  the  mass  of 
Radium  that  remains  after  t  years  by  solving  a  diﬀerential  equation. 

(b)  Find the amount of Radium remaining after 1000 years.  Simplify your answer 
using  the  fact  that  2−10/16  ≈  .65

(c)  Use  the  ﬁrst  two	 non-zero  terms  of  the  power  series  you  found  in  (a)  to 
approximate  ln 3/2. 

(d)  Give an upper bound on the error in your approximation in (c) using Taylor’s 
inequality.
