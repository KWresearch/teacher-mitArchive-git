Tips and questions 
 
This session will continue the discussion of the case on planning from below, 
including a detailed analysis of the mobilization against the dam project at 
multiple levels.  You should come prepared to volunteer and answer the 
several questions that will help us understand the nature of planning from 
below.  The focus will be the distinction between “institutional” and “non-
institutional” political action and their respective impacts on development 
planning, as well as the crucial differences and similarities between planning 
in a domestic context versus a global context. 
 
1.  According to Rajagopal and Sethi, why did the mobilization begin in the 
valley at first, what forms did it take and who was responsible for 
initiating it?  Could the planners of the project have anticipated it and 
done anything to mitigate it?  Try to identify the key factors of 
institutional politics behind development planning of large projects and 
their relationship to forms of non-institutional politics in terms of the 
methods used, goals defined and the resources used.  Is law simply an 
expression of institutional politics? 

2.  Think of the ways the mobilization emerged at both the local and global 
levels and try to identify the reasons behind it.  What concrete forms did 
the mobilization take locally and globally and how would you judge their 
effectives?  Does formal democracy constrain or enable mobilization as a 
form of planning, and if so at what level? 

3.  Is mobilization simply a critique, a reaction against traditional forms of 
development planning, or is it an articulation of real alternatives to 
existing practice?  What do you think of Sethi’s critique of the search for 
‘alternatives’ as a managerial response that leaves hard questions to be 
postponed to future generations?
