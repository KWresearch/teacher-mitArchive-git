In each case so far, we’ve seen the rich possibilities and challenges created 
by diverse interests, complex issues, constrained resources, and imperfect

structures for arriving at legitimate decisions. The theory and practice of 
negotiation and dispute resolution aim to address all of these problems—at 
least to some degree. As such, negotiation and dispute resolution are central 
to planning action; these are essential skills for problem-solvers worldwide. 
 
This week offers an intensive but necessarily limited introduction to the field, 
for which standard introductory courses run a full semester and many 
advanced elective courses are also available. The background reading is 
minimal and non-technical, so as to focus you on preparing your role and 
reflecting on the experience of competing and cooperating—simultaneously, 
while interacting with others—to craft agreement. 
 
1.  Susskind and Cruikshank’s work might be said to diagnose a problem 
in democratic decision-making and then prescribe dispute resolution (or 
negotiated agreement among stakeholders) as a remedy. If so, what 
exactly is the problem they are trying to remedy? What alternative 
approaches to disputes do they outline, and why—according to the 
authors—are those alternatives inadequate? 

2.  Fisher and Ury address themselves more to the individual negotiator or 
agent (e.g. lawyer representing clients). Does a focus on interests rather 
than positions necessarily enable negotiators to claim more value (“a 
bigger piece of the pie”), or are there other reasons for this focus? Why is 
it important to “invent before deciding”? 

3.  In Thompson, focus on the “What is your mental model …?” section, 
which is roughly two pages in length. The creativity exercises in the side 
panel are useful but not required as prep for our work; they illustrate the 
importance of identifying and removing mental blocks to better problem-
solving.
