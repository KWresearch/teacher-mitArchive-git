Tips and questions 

DUSP programs best highlighted in this case: HCED, CDD, EPG. 

This first session of the case will introduce it via lecture by Andy Altman (MCP ’88), 
who was, until he stepped down last week, Director of the Anacostia Waterfront 
Corporation and former planning director for Washington, DC.  The session will 
familiarize you with the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative and the historical context of 
comprehensive planning in the nation’s capital.  The second session will offer a 
counterpoint, with alternative narratives and challenging gaps in the Initiative that 
the city’s political leadership, residents, businesses, and civic groups must 
somehow bridge.  As usual, our assignment will revolve around both the positive 
potential and the gaps or dilemmas. 

Case background. As we saw in the case of Narmada, large-scale redevelopment 
unavoidably poses large risks and large potential rewards, as well as difficult 

questions about whether development can be achieved with some measure of 
social, economic, and political equity. The Anacostia Waterfront Initiative is an 
ongoing experiment in these questions. It proposes to transform the most 
neglected area of the U.S. capital city into a vibrant, mixed use, mixed income and 
racially diverse waterfront community—a place that is both an engine of growth and 
a model of livability. The project faces several dilemmas on which we will focus: 
How to be comprehensive in development planning when political and managerial 
factors, as well as some aspects of economic self-interest, tug constantly in the 
direction of incrementalism and fragmentation; how to promote “equitable 
development” within the bruising and unequal “growth machine” that cities can 
become, especially in market-driven societies; and—as we saw in the public 
housing case—how to leverage the power and also address the limits of physical 
design, or “placemaking,” as a tool for creating the good society. 

1.	 Katz and Altman provide a brief case for “comeback cities.” Be sure you’re 
clear on which forces, according to the authors, are driving revitalization now. 
Logan and Molotch describe city development through the lens of a “growth 
machine,” in which the various forces that compose local power structures battle 
about the form of city growth without challenging that such growth should 
occur.  Does the local government have a responsibility to foster the market 
growth of a city?  Have other forces successfully entered local power structures, 
and what values do they represent? 

2.  Based on the planning brochure and Bernstein and Hedgpeth articles, what 
institutional forces form the basis for the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative 
(AWI), and how do they compare to the forces highlighted by Logan and 
Molotch?  What aspects of the AWI plan seem most aimed at ensuring social and 
economic equity in the process of revitalization?  In what ways can physical 
design and land use promote such equity? 

3.  Historical context: Who had influence in the redevelopment of Southwest DC, 
according to Gillette? Does it seem possible to provide equitable development 
through a top-down approach?  Both the redevelopment of Southwest DC 
(decades ago) and the Anacostia Waterfront (now) are examples of 
comprehensive planning. The redeveloped section of Southwest is now a stable, 
mixed-income community. Does that mean we should consider the 
redevelopment plan a success?
