Tips and questions 
 
In the last session, we discussed planning traditions and the roots of the so-
called rational model. It’s the center of planning’s reasoned, precise—but too 
often technocratic—foundations as an outgrowth of scientific inquiry. Using 
four very different classic readings, this session will look closely at key limits 
of the rational model and at core dilemmas that propel the field of planning—
in practice and as a field of study, too. These dilemmas will be at the heart of 
our three big cases, which kick off next week. 

This is a heavy reading load rich in ideas. It lends especially itself well to 
some creative division of labor within your study groups, but be sure to learn 
the basics of each classic for yourself, via firsthand reading. 

1.  Why, according to Lindblom, is the rational model “essentially impossible 
to practice,” except for a limited category of decision problems? What 
does his “limited comparisons” method imply for how planners should do 
their work? 

2.  Altshuler argues that political realities make comprehensiveness rare, if 
not impossible, as planners work to develop goals democratically. This is 
one of the most influential studies ever done of the practice of local 
planning and its impact on decision-makers. What patterns in his local 
case does he use to substantiate his argument, and how convincing is it? 
Under what conditions might the goal-setting process or outcomes differ 
from those that Altshuler found?

3.  Davidoff urges planners to be advocates, not just technicians, and to 
engage in the “contentious work” of developing policy. How are the 
premises of his argument similar to or different from those of Altshuler? 
What are the key risks and opportunities in the vision of practice that 
Davidoff outlines? 

4.  “Why can’t the planners ever seem to do the right thing?” Why, according 
to Wildavsky, do planners become vulnerable, prone to “defending” and 
“rationalizing”? Why does he conclude, ultimately, that “Planning requires 
the resources, knowledge, and power of an entire people”? Is his 
conception of power different from Altshuler’s or Davidoff’s? Big-picture 
arguments aside, what are the concrete implications here for how 
planners should practice?
