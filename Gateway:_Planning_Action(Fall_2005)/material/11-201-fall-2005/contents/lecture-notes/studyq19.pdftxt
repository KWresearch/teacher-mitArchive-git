Reading Tips and Study Questions: For Session 19 

 
Required reading: 
 
None. 
 
 
Session overview 
 
I’ll be reviewing the major questions we’ve worked on and making 
connections to our cases and the most recent material (negotiation and 
stakeholder analysis, diversity).  
 
Please feel free to bring questions that relate to the final exam. I see this 
session as an opportunity to review main ideas about “planning action” that 
are covered in the exam, though I won’t limit myself to it. 
 
By way of session preview and taking stock on your learning through 
Gateway, you should, by the time you submit your final work for the course, 
be able to: 

•  Explain to someone the origins of modern planning—its intellectual hopes 
and political implications, its faith in science as the key to human 
progress. 

•  Outline key dilemmas embedded in that early modernist or rational 
planning model, including dilemmas about whose expertise counts, how 
legitimate decisions are to be made in the face of conflict, and what to do 
when expert knowledge turns out to be insufficient. 

•  Explain the main ideas in several proposals for reforming modernist 
planning, including advocacy planning, expanded citizen participation, the 
negotiation model, and the role of dialogue and deliberation. Have a 
sense of the promise and limits of each. 

• 

• 

In a related vein, outline how distinct traditions through which rational 
planning—once mapped onto unequal and competitive political 
environments—was shaped into social reform, social mobilization (another 
form of “planning from below”), and policy analysis. 

Identify some core opportunities and challenges for planning in the 
context of social diversity, whether in terms of reforming larger systems 
(that reflect historical biases) or improving decisionmaking processes (in 
ways that reflect an understanding of differences).

•  Consider how specific problems in specific contexts—contexts such as the 
Gateway cases but also the many cases that lie ahead in your graduate 
education and your careers—reflect these larger questions, for example: 
by illustrating institutional failures and deeper histories of inequality that 
make the original rational planning conception incredibly limited, if not 
downright dangerous when applied (Boston, Narmada); by confronting 
planners with problems that demand culturally competent application of 
an array of tools, not simple policy analysis and prescription (all three 
cases); and by entangling the “overall” public interest, varied citizen 
group interests, and private interests (market mechanisms) in ways that 
make equitable development—a core value of our Department and a 
challenging goal in practice—challenging to pursue (all three cases). 

•  Deliver your ideas, and develop those of teammates or other colleagues 
with whom you work, through professional workproducts, such as 
memoranda and briefings for decisionmakers. 

 
None of you began the course as technicians, but the aim was to generate 
learning about how one should approach the use of knowledge and technique 
to make a systematic difference in the world—“planning,” in that admittedly 
broad sense—and this is something that doesn’t happen automatically in a 
field with the strong technical origins and orientation that planning has. The 
hope is that the broad insights outlined above prepare you to think 
differently about course choices while here at MIT, to set priorities and 
explore new things in areas as varied as: politics and democratic 
decisionmaking, institutional analysis and management, negotiation and 
dispute resolution, ethics and public life, leadership, ambitious “substantive” 
policy areas that cross sectors and involve complex conflicts and many kinds 
of potentially useful knowledge, and practica where the conceptual dilemmas 
and practical problems come together in rich ways, and more. 
 
Finally, the course evaluation: My one plea is that you be as specific as 
possible in your open-ended comments on the evaluation form, because we’ll 
read each comment and think about them carefully in hopes of making 
Gateway stronger. Part of that is preserving what works, and part of it is 
trying new things or different things, so your input is crucial to both. 
 
Thanks very much - Xav
