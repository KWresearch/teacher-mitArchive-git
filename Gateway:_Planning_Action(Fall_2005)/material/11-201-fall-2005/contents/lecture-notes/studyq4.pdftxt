Tips and questions 
 
This first session of the case will introduce it via lecture by Prof. Vale. The 
next session will be run as an Ask-the-Expert session in which you should 
come prepared with questions that will help you complete the assignment, 
which is posted on the course website. 
 
Case background. Public Housing in the United States began in the 1930s as 
the first major effort by the federal government to provide for the housing 
needs of low-income households—i.e., to provide “social housing.” The 
approach included construction of rental housing developments (“projects”) 
to be owned and managed by government.  In Boston, as in many cities, 
public housing enjoyed more than two decades of initial success.  By the end 
of the 1970s, however, the projects had failed miserably—in both social and 
architectural terms.  The Boston Housing Authority (BHA), charged with 
managing these places, was a completely dysfunctional organization and was 
placed under court-ordered “receivership”—meaning it was considered 
incapable of governing and operating itself—in 1980.   

During the receivership, the BHA launched three ambitious redevelopment 
efforts, at the West Broadway, Franklin Field, and Commonwealth housing 
projects.  The three similarly designed projects had been built at the same 
time under the same government program and had experienced similar 
declines.  Each received comparable funding for redevelopment (tens of 
millions of dollars), and each redevelopment team consisted of first-rate 
design and planning professionals who responded with similar “defensible 
space” redesign plans.  Why, then, was one redevelopment effort 
(Commonwealth) touted nationally as a success story, another only a mixed 
success (West Broadway), and the third a widely acknowledged failure 
(Franklin Field)?  To answer this question, one must understand several

classic tensions in planning as they apply to this case: complex 
neighborhood-specific struggles over race and poverty (in broad terms: 
planning for diverse publics and the conflicts that diversity can produce); the 
strengths and limits of physical design as a redevelopment tool for promoting 
social welfare; the cultural tensions over the proper roles to be played by the 
private and public sectors; and the roles of expert versus indigenous 
knowledge—i.e., the aims and expectations of both expert professionals and 
the resident communities that needed to work together. 

1.  Marcuse contends that the “reformer’s program” was but one iteration of 
public housing. Is his argument persuasive? Why or why not? If so, what 
caution does this history suggest planners should have about using 
government to guide important reforms? Consider what Friedmann, in our 
reading for last week, outlined as the social reform tradition in planning. 

2.  Now consider the Vale chapters. Before embarking on redevelopment 
efforts, BHA planners produced a study predicting the places where 
redevelopment would most likely prove effective and where it would be 
hardest to pull off.  Correctly, they anticipated that Commonwealth would 
be most likely to succeed and that Franklin Field would be least likely.  In 
taking action to improve public housing, does it make sense—whether on 
efficiency or equity or other bases—for planners to focus only on the 
“most likely to succeed” places?  

3.  If so, what social and political factors (such as the role of race) make it 
difficult to do this? 

4.  Alternatively, how can planners justify putting scarce dollars into places 
where, right from the start, successful redevelopment seems unlikely?
