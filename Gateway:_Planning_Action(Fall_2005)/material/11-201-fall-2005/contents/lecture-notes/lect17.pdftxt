Slide 1

Reminders

(cid:131) Many good planning ideas struggle for 
support, “will,” constituencies.
(cid:131) We care about negotiation, stakeholder 
analysis, process management, and 
related skills because they’re more and 
more important to “planning action.”
(cid:131) Coalition building is especially crucial for 
accomplishing important, contested things 
in the world.
(cid:131) A negotiation experience is valuable if you 
can reflect on it and draw useful lessons, 
but it’s easy to draw the wrong ones.

Slide 2

Preparing for Seeport

Analyzing multi-party, multi-issue situations:
(cid:131) Our and their interests, priorities among those? 
(cid:131) Our and their no-agreement alternatives, 
aspirations? Some can live without deal.
(cid:131) Our and their likely allies, adversaries?
(cid:131) Potential agreements (“bundles”)?
(cid:131) Process: Value of pre-meeting moves? Likely 
process leaders (influentials)?

The basics of join gain (win-win)

“Exploiting differences”: Trading away 
something we value less for something we 
value more (with someone whose values are 
the inverse):

ISSUE

Party A

Party B

One

Two

Values more

Does not value

Values less

Values more

Imbalances and “Power”

Advantaged parties Vulnerable parties

Enviro League

Federal DCR
Key for vulnerable: be proactive, block if 
necessary, avoid getting shut out
Key for advantaged: head off “blocking 
coalitions,” get a deal done (mega-project).

Slide 6

“Vulnerable” ≠ powerless

(cid:131) “Resources” (structural advantages) do not 
ensure “resourcefulness.”
(cid:131) Likewise, a lack of resources (or a structural 
disadvantage) calls for extra
resourcefulness.
(cid:131) Keys are: (a) savvy preparation “away from 
the table,” (b) getting to the table “early”
(consider pre-meeting moves, avoid getting 
shut out by early side deals), (c) heading off 
or breaking up adverse coalitions while “at”
the table, and (d) creating a “blocking”
coalition if necessary.

Slide 7

Many bases for coalition building

“Politics makes strange bedfellows.”
(cid:131) Shared interests?
(cid:131) Shared positions (e.g., no deal)?
(cid:131) Valuable trades?
(cid:131) Common history?
(cid:131) Common allies or enemies?
(cid:131) Shared vulnerability?

Slide 8

Changing the game

(cid:131) Trying to “win” at “their” game vs. 
change the game (“setup”).
(cid:131) Ourtown: Issues and options not fixed, 
much room for creative framing and 
brainstorming.
(cid:131) Changing the setup (issues, parties, 
rules and incentives) can be crucial 
politically but hard to accomplish 
(controversial, impractical).

POWER. Parties often have more power and coalition 
potential than they assume. Structure merely sets up 
possibilities and boundaries—key is “resourcefulness, 
not just resources,” and coalitions are often key.
COALITIONS. Strong coalitions tend to be based on 
shared interests and/or values, but many bases are 
possible.
PROCESS PLANNING. Keys to sequencing that let you 
create and claim value: carefully packaging issues, 
sequencing meetings, being proactive about both 
favorable and “blocking” coalitions.
YOU IN THE PROCESS. Know and develop your 
strengths, know and develop your weaknesses—and 
look for partners to compensate. Need “bandwidth”
