GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 1

Today’s learning objectives

(cid:131) Examine assumptions about being effective in a 
world of cooperators, competitors, complex 
issues, and diverse interests.
(cid:131) Explore strategies and tactics for forging and 
sustaining trust and cooperation—the keys to 
coalition building. Most important public 
purposes, and many private ones, are 
accomplished only by coalitions.
(cid:131) Re-analyze some issues at stake in our past 
cases (Public housing, Narmada, Anacostia)
(cid:131) Begin to reflect on your own style and skills
(“repertoire”) as a negotiator.

Slide 2

Susskind and Cruikshank (1987)

(cid:131) Problem: Impasse (inability to 
reach agreement in important 
public disputes)
(cid:131) Where: Issues complex, interests 
diverse, spillovers common, 
impasse costly.
(cid:131) Prescription: negotiated 
agreement, multi-stakeholder 
process (look for “joint gain”)

Slide 3

Fisher et al. Getting to yes

(cid:131) Focus on your interests, not positions. OK, but 
agreements eventually include specific positions 
(terms). Emotions of conflict (pride, anxiety, 
confusion) tend to make us positional.
(cid:131) Separate the people from the problem. Crucial but 
hard to do—negotiation includes interpersonal 
exchange, and doing homework on their style and 
reputation is often key.
(cid:131) Invent options for mutual gain (“deal design”). The 
creative element—when there’s room, when the 
scope (issues and options) isn’t fixed.

Slide 4

But …

(cid:131) Is negotiated agreement always best? No, but 
being able to negotiate effectively is essential.
(cid:131) Is a cooperative style “most likely to succeed”? 
Not necessarily, depends on counterparts and 
structure of the negotiation (situation).
(cid:131) So: need tools for assessing situations, broad 
repertoire of analytic and interpersonal skills, 
adaptable style. Strength “above and below the 
neck” (analytic smarts + self-management)
(cid:131) Biggest mistake made by inexperienced 
negotiators? ____________

Slide 5

“Win as much as you can”: Structure?

What is a negotiation’s structure?
(cid:131) Parties (stakeholders: number and type)
(cid:131) Issues
(cid:131) Interests
(cid:131) Options
(cid:131) Rules and incentives

Examples: 2-party 1-issue, 2-party multi-
issue, multi-party 1 or multi-issue

Iron logic? Whatever they play, I should play ___. What does this 
assume about the information I have?

Slide 7

Strategy across rounds

(cid:131) In final round (10), no future, so …
“iron logic” applies, play X
(cid:131) If they will play X in round 10, I should 
play what in 9? ___
(cid:131) And so on, backward to round 1.
Case closed? Make the competitive move 
always?

Slide 8

Beyond the “iron logic” favoring 
competition over cooperation
(cid:131) The structure shapes incentives in crucial ways, 
helps explain lack of cooperation where parties 
could benefit. But interactive problem-solving is 
a human process.
(cid:131) Trust: How do I know I can trust them? How do I 
make myself seem trustworthy?
(cid:131) Communication: The message intended may 
not be the one received. Signals matter.
(cid:131) History and relationships: Reputation can 
promote or undermine trust, relationships built 
on trust can overcome powerful structural 
barriers. 
(cid:131) Framing matters: What if we call it “the 
community game”? The “Wall Street game”?

Slide 9

Advantageously shaping their choices

Their beliefs
They see the benefits of sustained 
cooperation.
They see the interaction as 
cooperative.
They trust you to play Y’s.

They believe others will play Y’s.

They agree to play Y.

Agreement is clear.

Compliance mechanisms are in 
place, alternative (play X) is 
unattractive.

Your strategy to shape
Analyze game and explain clearly.

Act cooperatively, avoid needless 
provocation.
Make yourself seem trustworthy.

Build and sustain a cooperative 
coalition.
Offer and seek explicit agreement.

Avoid ambiguity, beware “crossed 
wires” (confusion).
Secure the deal with compliance 
mechanisms, commit to “principled 
retaliation.”

Slide 10

Lessons and review

(cid:131) Expectations of shared decisionmaking are 
on the rise, but impasses are common and 
costly.
(cid:131) Basic principles help one rethink 
negotiation, but pitfalls are common, and 
most negotiators under-prepare.
(cid:131) Analyze a situation’s structure realistically, 
then consider people or process factors.
(cid:131) Forge cooperation: work to win and sustain 
trust, send clear signals, negotiate with 
deeds (visible commitments), bolster trust 
with compliance mechanisms. “Tit-for-tat.”
