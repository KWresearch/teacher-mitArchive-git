Power and limits of physical 
design
• Physical design as a tool for enhancing well-being
• Can it also enhance equity, i.e. address inequities?
• What “social needs” are uniquely addressed by design 
interventions?
• How to address a diversity of users/publics?
• Culture and values: What’s culturally determined? How are 
meanings attached to space? What does design assume about 
“community”?

Trained vs. indigenous experts

• What forms of knowledge are valid? Who sets 
the rules?
• What does public participation add to what 
technical experts provide?
• How can distinct types of expertise be blended

solutions?
• Technocratic modernism vs. “deliberative 
democracy”

The Boston Housing Authority

• The Power and Limits of Social Reform and 
Environmental Determinism
• Evolution of a Troubled Institution:  From 
High Hopes … to 
Collapse/Receivership…to 
Partial Recovery

• Early Public Housing:
Optimism
Open-ness
Opportunity

Taking Collective Action to 
Redevelop Public Housing: 
Why did 1 City have 3 Outcomes?

• West Broadway (“D Street”), South Boston
• Franklin Field, Dorchester
• Commonwealth (“Fidelis Way”), Brighton

3 Projects, 3 Contexts

Commonwealth:
Struggled to preserve integrated housing in a less integrated area.
West Broadway:
Predominantly white, struggled with re-integration.
Franklin Field
Struggled with disinvestment and lack of political clout.

BHA: A New Public Mission

• “The Authority recognizes that not only its 
statutory responsibility but also its moral, 
public responsibility to accommodate low-
income families in need of housing limit its 
freedom to reject the potentially 
unacceptable tenant.”
– BHA Statement, 1965

BHA, 1965 Mission

• “Families whose standards make them 
unacceptable are a responsibility of the 
community and, so far as their need for low-
rent housing is concerned, of the 
Authority.”
