Unit Four: The Growth Machine and the Public Interest - Reinventing 
the Anacostia Waterfront in Washington, DC (Prof. Altman) 

CASE BACKGROUND 
 
As we saw in the case of Narmada, large-scale redevelopment unavoidably 
poses large risks and large potential rewards, as well as difficult questions 
about whether development can be achieved with some measure of social, 
economic, and political equity. The Anacostia Waterfront Initiative in 
Washington, DC is an ongoing experiment in these questions. It proposes to 
transform the most neglected area of the U.S. capital city into a vibrant, 
mixed use, mixed income and racially diverse waterfront community—a place 
that is both an engine of growth and a model of livability. The project, 
headed by DUSP alumnus Andrew Altman (MCP ’88), former Director of 
Planning for the District of Columbia, faces several dilemmas on which we 
will focus: How to be comprehensive in development planning when political 
and managerial factors, as well as some aspects of economic self-interest, 
tug constantly in the direction of incrementalism and fragmentation; how to 
promote “equitable development” within the bruising and unequal “growth 
machine” that cities can become, especially in market-driven societies; and—
as we saw in the public housing case—how to leverage the power and also 
address the limits of physical design—and “placemaking”—as a tool for 
creating the good society.
