Tips and questions 
 
Each of these sheets is like the rudder on a supertanker: Small in scale but 
really important. We’ll use these sheets to provide “connective tissue” for the 
course, outlining the sequence of ideas and key debates on which we will 
focus in Gateway, punctuating important transitions between segments of 
the course, and in other ways illuminating why we’re doing the work we’re 
doing, step by step. Always read these tips and questions before doing the 
assigned reading for the session. 
 
We have two things to accomplish in the first part of the course: Becoming a 
group that can learn effectively together, in both small settings (study 
groups) and large ones (class meetings); and critically reviewing the origins 
and evolution of planning. We’ll do the latter in broad terms at first, to 
prepare for the three big cases that will give theory and other general ideas 
about planning a context. 
 
A final word of preface: Our focus is on planning in democratic societies. But 
you’ll note immediately that much writing about “planning” is focused on so-
called Western planning, i.e. planning after the 18th century in North America 
and Europe. Complex systems of order and planning (broadly defined) 
obviously go back to the Ancient Roman and Persian Empires and beyond 
(Egypt, 2900 BC?) , and China had large, elaborate systems of planned 
intervention—to build great cities and a Great Wall, as early as 214 BC—
many centuries before Europe’s intellectual awakening a half millennium ago. 
This is something for us to talk about. For now, the important thing is that 
the most influential planning—for good or ill—is the form that developed and 
defined its role in the specific cultural and historical settings discussed by

Friedmann and others we will read in this first unit of the course. It is this 
planning that has swept the globe, via specific channels and with major 
consequences. Understanding what’s influential is critical, though it’s very 
distinct from understanding all that is good or desirable or original. 
 
Read through the syllabus, calendar and readings carefully so you can 
identify questions you want to ask, and then these questions, to go with 
readings 1-3 above: 
 
1.  The two pages of Campbell and Fainstein are dense with important 
arguments. What are they? In light of Friedmann (next item), why might 
a critical understanding of planning theory be important if, as Campbell 
and Fainstein claim, it’s hard to define and “practitioners largely disregard 
it”? You may be able to identify, in some field in which you’ve worked, 
“assimilated” ideas that shaped practice in powerful, albeit rarely visible, 
ways. 

2.  What principal assumptions accompany the origins of planning after the 
18th century, according to Friedmann? In light of today’s experience, 
what are the strengths and weaknesses of a societal model in which, as 
Friedmann puts it, politicians handle “values” toward which we should aim 
and planners navigate “facts” to determine the means of realizing those 
aims? What aspects of Friedmann’s critical assessment of planning are 
most and least convincing, i.e., of his arguments about the inadequacy of 
“planning as societal guidance” to cope with “the crises of industrial 
capitalism”? Note that Friedmann was writing in 1987, before the fall of 
the Berlin Wall and with it the Soviet Union, before capitalism’s declared 
“victory” as the model for economy and society. 

3.  Klosterman echoes a number of Friedmann’s arguments about the 
decline of planning, and erosion of its claims to legitimacy, following a 
golden age at mid-2oth century. What are the key differences between 
economic and “pluralist” arguments about planning? How about between 
“traditional” and Marxist arguments? What does Klosterman mean when 
he claims that planning retains justifiable claims about its ends—as 
meeting social needs—but not its means, i.e. no agreed-upon “procedural 
model for defining planning problems or justifying planning solutions”? 

4.  How does focusing our perspective outside of government—outside 
the state, in international parlance—shift any of these considerations? 
That is, do very general justifications for planning, many of which justify 
government’s role more generally, tell us very much about how planners 
should act, particularly in private and nongovernmental roles and 
contexts?
