Tips and questions 
 
This second lecture and discussion will look more closely at the politics of 
redevelopment East of the River and at prospects for equitable development. Andy 
Altman will lead the session, with two DUSP faculty members as our guest 
lecturers: Frank Levy (economic analysis) and Karl Seidman (economic 
development strategy and tools). Though the area has important assets, especially 
from the perspective of residents with long ties to the place, Anacostia is one of the 
poorest and highest crime areas in DC. Today’s reading provides alternative 
narratives that highlight the struggles of residents and others. 
 
The following session (Session 14) consists of student briefings. As such, there will 
no reading assignment, and no study questions on the website, for that session. 
Your next reading assignment is for Session 15. 
 
1.  How did the influences of the redevelopment of Shaw differ from those of 
Southwest according to Gillette?  Is one approach more desirable than the 
other?  While Southwest DC quickly stabilized, Shaw continued to be a 
neighborhood with high levels of poverty and crime for decades. 

2.  Which issues in Policy Link’s report seem particularly relevant to Anacostia? 

3.  Williams initially seems to frame the history of the Anacostia River in Logan 
and Molotch’s terms—as a battle between use and exchange values—but 
Williams does not explicitly draw on this dialectic in the body of the article.  
Where in his narrative does this tension play out?  How does this analysis of the 
Anacostia River through the perspective of environmental justice and race 
inform an understanding of the “growth machine”? 

4.  See the Post articles and maps. The illustration in William’s article on p. 423 
shows that opposition to the redevelopment of Southwest worried that Anacostia 
would become the new site of racial enclosure.  In fact, the city is currently 
segregated along lines of not only race but also income, employment, and 
crime.  Many Anacostia residents, including some who lived through the earlier 
process of relocation, are fearful and skeptical about where the current process 
of redevelopment will lead. How might a redevelopment agency address those 
concerns? Or is there no escaping the past? 

You may skim the Fuller report in preparation for this session. It is a brief, data-rich  
reference item that should be useful as you complete the assignment. 

These readings emphasize the social challenges and needs of Anacostia’s residents, 
yet the plan of the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative is largely—so far—one of physical 
design.  We want to explore further the realism of integrating place-based and 
people-based strategies of planning. Is a “comprehensive” plan necessarily more 
place-based?  Can a plan that begins with the re-use of space adequately address 
the deep social and economic disparities affecting residents?
