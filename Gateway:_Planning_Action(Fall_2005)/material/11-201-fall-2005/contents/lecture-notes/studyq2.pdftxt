Tips and questions 
 
In Session One, we used the Rebuild LA case as a window on some core 
themes and dilemmas facing planning. We’ll revisit and re-analyze RLA in this 
session but also move beyond it, considering distinct traditions of planning as 
a way of understanding the field and its development. This sets up Session 
Three, which will focus on dilemmas and highlight the central dilemmas in 
the three cases to come. 

1.  Friedmann provides a sweeping history of major traditions. OK, it’s not 
page-turning beach reading, but the history of ideas here is very valuable 
and very compact, considering his scope. Identify the core motivation 
behind each tradition, as well as links among them. How does each 
illuminate problems faced in rebuilding LA, as well as opportunities for 
constructive action? 

2.  Meyerson and Banfield outline the foundations of the rational model of 
decisionmaking, which underlies planning’s policy analysis tradition in 
particular. This is a classic reading in the field, in part because so many 
critics have responded to it, as we’ll see in Session Three. What are the 
model’s core assumptions? How well do they apply to decision-making in 
the Rebuild LA case? Does the model capture the way you’ve made 
important decisions in your personal or profession life? 

3.  What does the traditional conception of “development” ignore, according 
to the brief excerpt by Amartya Sen? Sen is a respected and influential 
economist whose book outlines important limits of traditional, economics-
driven thinking about the good society and how to promote it. Are Sen’s 
arguments at odds with those of Friedmann, i.e. about what various 
conceptions of the good society imply and how they play out in practice?
