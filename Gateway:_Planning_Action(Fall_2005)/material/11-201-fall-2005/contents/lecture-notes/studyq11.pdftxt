Tips and questions 
 
1.  Sen suggests that both the means and ends of development are to be 
thought of in terms of ‘freedom’.  If development is about cultural change, 
then what role do you see for universal categories, such as ‘freedom,’ in 
that change? 

2.  Is economic development about cultural change?  If so, how and who 
should bring this about?  Do you agree with Rajagopal that social 
movements enact a form of cultural politics that are in fact quite 
distinctive from the universal normative projects of development or 
human rights?  How can planners engage in international economic 
development without enacting a ‘cultural politics’? 

3.  Who are “radical planners,” according to Friedmann? What do they do, 
what skills do they require, and what dilemmas of strategy and practice 
do they face? 

4.  What dilemmas does Briggs highlight through his focus on practical, 
strategic problems of mobilization (“organizing”)? In what primary ways is 
organizing misunderstood or “malpracticed”?

For a look at the politics of mega-projects, nonprofit and business 
roles, etc. in the U.S.: 

Alan Altshuler and David Luberoff, Mega-Projects: The Changing Politics of 
Urban Public Investment (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution and Lincoln 
Institute of Land Policy, 2004). 
 
What parallels are evident between the politics of public investment in U.S. 
cities, as analyzed by Altshuler and Luberoff, and the increasingly global 
politics of infrastructure projects in developing countries, as analyzed by 
Khagram, Rajagopal, and others we read in the Narmada case? Does the 
growth of business influence in recent years necessarily threaten popular 
mobilization?
