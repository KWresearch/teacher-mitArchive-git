Unit Three: Development and Mobilization - Narmada in India (Prof. 
Rajagopal)  

CASE BACKGROUND 
 
As one of the largest infrastructure development efforts ever launched, the 
Narmada dam projects were conceived in the 1950s and began to be 
implemented from the 1970s in the western part of India, along one of the 
longest rivers in India. The project consisted of 30 major, 135 medium and 
almost 3000 small dams stretching across three Indian states in the 
Narmada valley. From its inception, the project ran into trouble at various 
levels—most intensely from the people living in the valley, who organized an 
unprecedented national and international campaign to obtain better terms for 
resettlement and even stop some elements of the project.  Despite this 
opposition, the construction of the dams has proceeded, albeit slower than 
planned, resulting in the forced displacement of thousands of tribal people 
and farmers, as well as the flooding of ecologically sensitive areas.  The 
violence of these development projects has particularly and overwhelmingly 
affected socially and economically weaker classes, especially those belonging 
to India’s historically marginalized caste groups.  Through this case study, 
what lessons can we draw about the planning of mega projects in general, 
and the role of planners in ‘Third World’ settings? What is the relationship 
between planners and the intended beneficiaries and victims of the projects?  
Is planning in the ‘Third World’ different, and what is the relationship 
between planning and ‘development’?  To evaluate the answers to these and 
other questions, three frameworks—each of fundamental importance to the 
evolving theory and practice of planning—are applied: planning from below 
(including planning-as-social-mobilization) versus planning from above; 
domestic versus international framing in planning and development (or 
“planning in a global age”), and the role and limits of institutional versus 
non-institutional politics in planning and development.
