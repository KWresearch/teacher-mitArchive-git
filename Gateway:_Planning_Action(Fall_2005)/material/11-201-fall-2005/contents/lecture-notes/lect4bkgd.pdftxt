Unit Two: Public Housing Redevelopment in Boston (Prof. Vale) 

CASE BACKGROUND: 

Public Housing in the United States began in the 1930s as the first major 
effort by the federal government to provide for the housing needs of low-
income households—i.e., to provide “social housing.” The approach included 
construction of rental housing developments (“projects”) to be owned and 
managed by government.  In Boston, as in many cities, public housing 
enjoyed more than two decades of initial success.  By the end of the 1970s, 
however, the projects had failed miserably—in both social and architectural 
terms.  The Boston Housing Authority (BHA), charged with managing these 
places, was a completely dysfunctional organization and was placed under 
court-ordered “receivership”—meaning it was considered incapable of 
governing and operating itself—in 1980.   

During the receivership, the BHA launched three ambitious redevelopment 
efforts, at the West Broadway, Franklin Field, and Commonwealth housing 
projects.  The three similarly designed projects had been built at the same 
time under the same government program and had experienced similar 
declines.  Each received comparable funding for redevelopment (tens of 
millions of dollars), and each redevelopment team consisted of first-rate 
design and planning professionals who responded with similar “defensible 
space” redesign plans.  Why, then, was one redevelopment effort 
(Commonwealth) touted nationally as a success story, another only a mixed 
success (West Broadway), and the third a widely acknowledged failure 
(Franklin Field)?  To answer this question, one must understand several 
classic tensions in planning as they apply to this case: complex 
neighborhood-specific struggles over race and poverty (in broad terms: 
planning for diverse publics and the conflicts that diversity can produce); the 
strengths and limits of physical design as a redevelopment tool for promoting 
social welfare; the cultural tensions over the proper roles to be played by the 
private and public sectors; and the roles of expert versus indigenous 
knowledge—i.e., the aims and expectations of both expert professionals and 
the resident communities that needed to work together.
