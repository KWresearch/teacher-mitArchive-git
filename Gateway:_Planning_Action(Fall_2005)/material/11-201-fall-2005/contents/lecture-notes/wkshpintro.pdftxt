Session overview. This is the first of two workshops on the skills of professional 
communication. You’ll learn about briefings and help critique student briefings on 
screen. 
 
Your briefing assignment in this course is a group assignment. Careful preparation 
for groupwork is sadly rare—far too rare—in planning programs. This session will 
double as a critical introduction to workgroup performance—how to organize and 
lead workgroups (teams) to perform. Xav will discuss core concepts of team 
building and team leadership, as well as tools for assessing your capacity to 
contribute to teams and lead them. 
 
Questions to consider 
 
1.  Getting clear on core concepts. According to the introduction excerpt, how 
should we define the effectiveness of workgroups? 

2.  Analyzing a team. Your workgroup in Gateway will take the form of what this 
book calls a “task force”—i.e., a project team, of limited duration, entrusted with 
completing a specific task. Why does the team in the chapter entitled “The 
Students” seem to struggle with its task? What process mistakes were made, in 
particular? 

3.  You and Teamwork (Self-assessment): Experts on leading teams often 
speak of two things teams manage toward: task (getting things done) and 
relationship (getting along, connecting, cultivating team members, generating 
satisfaction in the work). And also three emotional needs, which lead individuals 
to play very different roles in teams—the needs for inclusion, control, and 
affection. What kinds of group situations bring out the best in you? Which are 
more challenging and why? How do these patterns reflect the things you tend to 
expect or demand when working in groups, i.e. your needs?
