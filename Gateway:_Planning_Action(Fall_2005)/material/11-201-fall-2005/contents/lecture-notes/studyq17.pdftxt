Tips and questions 
 
Our debrief and extension of your multi-party negotiation will consider 
several levels of the experience: (a) how to analyze issues and coalitions 
when a variety of issues, stakeholders, and interests are in play (analysis to 
develop a strategy); (b) how to be effective while negotiating “at the table” 
(tactics); and (c) the personal experience of the negotiation process, 
including consideration of the skills you have, how you think and respond 
emotionally, and what you need to work on. 
 
1.  Which of the skills identified by Fisher and Davis do you feel you bring 
to negotiation, and which do you most need to develop? In what kinds of 
professional situations have you found these, or other, skills to be 
particularly important for solving problems interactively with others? What 
is your plan for developing more of the needed skills? 

2.  Negotiation is often useful, but why, according to Briggs, is it not always 
appropriate where there’s a conflict among stakeholders? How is the 
Ourtown negotiation (Case #2, beginning on page 20) similar to the one 
you conducted (the exercise)? How is it different? Think, in particular, 
about what is or isn’t fixed when the negotiators approach the problem.
