Tips and questions 
 
In this session, we’ll revisit the field, making reference to the public housing 
case but consciously asking broader questions about the dilemmas in 
planning, both past and present. 
 
An important part of revisiting the field is tackling questions on the two levels 
we discussed in weeks one and two: (a) the ends of planning; and (b) the 
means, including decision-making processes that guide planning. The first 
two readings are primarily concerned with ends, the latter two with means. 
 
1.  Fishman. The utopian proposals of Howard, Wright, and Le Corbusier—
together with the sweeping critique of utopian modernism offered by Jane 
Jacobs—bracket key dilemmas in 20th century thought about planning. 
Two of these classic dilemmas concern: the roles of professional vs. 
indigenous knowledge; and the power and limits of physical design 
solutions vs. social policy. In retrospect, given the array of socio-
economic challenges facing families in public housing, does it make sense 
that the vast majority of redevelopment funding went toward intervention

in the realm of design?  More broadly, how might the field of planning find 
productive ways to embrace both its roots in physical design and its 
somewhat more recent emphasis on social policies and programs? Are 
these always likely to be in tension? 

2.  How does Scott’s concept of “high modernism” relate to Friedmann’s 
account—weeks back in our course—of the origins of planning and its 
goals? What is the value of practical knowledge (mētis), according to 
Scott, and what are its sources? 

3.  Where efforts to blend forms of knowledge are concerned, what critical 
mistakes does Briggs claim are common to “participatory” planning 
efforts? What range of objectives do these efforts reflect? Which 
objectives and challenges were evident in the BHA effort to “engage” 
residents in redevelopment? 

4.  Fung makes specific arguments about the value of deliberative problem-
solving that engages citizens with their government. How is such 
problem-solving, in the form of “accountable autonomy,” different from 
citizen-led efforts to create, say, alternative community plans (or “plural 
plans,” per Davidoff)? Which common challenges does Fung identify for 
deliberative efforts, and how does he suggest Chicago initiatives 
responded to those challenges? 

 

Further reading and coursework 

Many courses at MIT and other schools address the role of physical design 
and social policy—and some look carefully at both. On the process side, there 
is a large and growing body of research, commentary, and practice notes on 
“deliberative” and “participatory” and “community-driven” planning, which 
has deep roots in planning practice worldwide. What’s more, a variety of 
courses at MIT, Harvard and other areas schools address these issues and 
needed skills.
