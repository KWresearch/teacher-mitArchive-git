Slide 2

Rebuilding L.A.: Revisited

(cid:131) Crisis context: High visibility, varied 
expectations, fragmented communication, 
limited trust.
(cid:131) Many inter-connected problems, with technical 
and political dimensions, to be defined.
(cid:131) Resources: Extraordinary interest, 
relationships, money, and more—available to be 
mobilized.
(cid:131) Spotlight: An entrepreneurial institution with a 
well-defined (narrow?) focus.
“Planning” in action in the public domain 
addresses all of these—or relegates itself to 
technical support.

Slide 3

Some strategic options (year 2 on)

Slide 4

The first “school” of planning

Saint-Simon/Comte, according to 
Friedmann:
(cid:131) Rigid, functional division of labor: 
“Theoretician-planners” and administrators vs. 
everyone else.
(cid:131) Politics as “inconsequential,” not a “guiding 
force”—trumped by immutable scientific laws, 
including “social physics.”
(cid:131) Addressed to “the rulers of society.”

Slide 10

Fundamental questions

(cid:131) Ends: What defines the good society? 
Economic gain, human “freedom” defined by 
capabilities (Sen), something else?
(cid:131) What are the most effective means of 
intervention? Does “effective” include 
legitimate?
(cid:131) Who decides and how?

GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 11

Action requires actors: Who plans?

(cid:131) Trained professional planners with job 
titles that say “Planner”

title

advocates (nongovernmental, private)
(cid:131) Grassroots vs. “grasstops”
(cid:131) Others who shape what is planned (stop 
or change what professionals propose)

all popular ideas are wise, not all wise ones are 
popular or legitimate.

(cid:131) Educate and advocate?
(cid:131) Answer to the client/employer vs. constituents, the 
marginalized?

environment, engagement) and enhances 
freedoms.
(cid:131) The process was effective (produced the desired 
output or outcome)
