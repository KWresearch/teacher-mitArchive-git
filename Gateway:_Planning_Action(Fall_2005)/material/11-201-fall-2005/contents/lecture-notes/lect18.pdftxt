What’s the issue?

Diversity accommodation encounter 
Resistance Competition conflict
Cooperation co-existence?
Melting pots, salad bowls, gumbo?
Cultural fusion >< enclaves Preservation
ANXIETY change … border-crossings

The human journey:
60,000 years and counting

The National Geographic Genographic Project

Dominant African mitochondrial lineage (L2) 
appeared 58,000 – 78,000 years ago in East 
Africa, but migrated across the continent, 
predominantly to West Africa. 
- Present at around 20% in the Americas.

Migrations
The National Geographic Genographic Project

The genetic marker present in all human 
populations outside of Africa appeard between 
31,000 and 79,000 years ago. 
Descendants of this lineage migrated across 
Europe and Asia, and through Asia, the 
Americas. 
About 10,000 years ago, a close ancestor 
lineage migrated to Australia, Asia, and North 
America.

Three factors in 
“managing” diversity
1. Boundary shift. The definitions and 
salience of difference categories themselves: 
e.g., expansion of high-status “white” group 
in U.S.
2. Tolerance (“living with,” accommodation in 
attitude and behavior): not necessarily active 
curiosity and respect.
3. Cross-cutting loyalties (one identity cuts 
across another, holds in check): e.g., race 
vs. class or religion. Networks track 
identities, may bridge.

Possible lessons
of history
(cid:139) Contemporary hopes about making 
diversity work hinge far too much on 
gains in tolerance.
(cid:139) Lessons of history point to the roles of 
integrative projects (absorption and 
recognition), cross-cutting loyalties, 
and strong public order to buttress 
tolerance.

The Diversity Challenge and 
Opportunity: Three “Norths”
Three (3) types of affluent nations:
(cid:139) Traditional “settler states” (U.S., Canada, 
Australia): long experience with immigration 
but now non-European for first time
(cid:139) First-wave states (Western Europe): first 
major experience underway, non-Euro groups
(cid:139) Non-immigrant states (e.g., Japan): little/no 
immigration despite significant demographic 
need

Multiple “Souths”
(cid:139) Multi-ethnic democratic states (e.g., India, 
Brazil, South Africa): diverse religious and 
linguistic and/or racial traditions, legacy of 
colonialism, partisan manipulation.
(cid:139) Transition states (Eastern Europe, Central 
Asia): ethnic identity linked to political 
autonomy, long repressed.
(cid:139) Post-conflict states (e.g. Rwanda, 
Afghanistan): development success as cause 
and effect of inter-ethnic problem-solving.
(cid:139) Other states: tribes, regions.

Brazil: “The myth of 
racial democracy”
University of São Paulo study
(cid:139) 98% of Brazilians report that they are 
not racially prejudiced.
(cid:139) 100% of Brazilians report that they know
someone who is.
(cid:139) Conclusion: “Every Brazilian is an island 
of tolerance in a sea of bigots.”

Identity and nationhood
What makes someone 
French?
Born in Senegal, Semou Diouf, 50, has spoken French 
all his life and was educated in France but says he still 
feels like an outsider, despite living under a 
Constitution that is officially color blind. (NYT 11-11-

Names, ethnicity 
and status

Planning theory
(cid:139) How diversity shapes planning 
processes (including “micro-politics” of 
interaction)
(cid:139) How planning systems reflect bias and 
dominant norms and also channel them.
(cid:139) How “diversity” objectives compete with 
one another (Fainstein 2005): 
Arguments for the “just city.”

Your learning agenda?

(cid:139) Develop a critical understanding of how 
culture and power have shaped planning 
systems in the places you want to work.
(cid:139) Enhance own cultural competence—for 
multiple tasks.
(cid:139) Develop more emotional intelligence: 
“reading” self and others.
(cid:139) Practice “active respect.”

Ours is not a caravan of despair.
