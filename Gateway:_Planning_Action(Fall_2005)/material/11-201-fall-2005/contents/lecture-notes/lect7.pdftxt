Revisiting the Field
What does the redevelopment of public housing 
imply for the ends and means of planning?

1. The strengths and limitations of modernist 
design and the dilemma of expert vs. 
indigenous knowledge (Jacobs, Fishman, 
and Scott)
2.   Decision-making (Briggs and Fung)

Critique of:
The Radiant Garden City Beautiful

JJJane Jacobs: 

Warns of “the dishonest mask of 
pretended order, achieved by 
ignoring or suppressing the real 
order that is struggling to exist 
and be served.” (p. 15)

Jane Jacobs:
[Howard’s] “prescription for the 
city was to do the city in.”
He advocated: “really nice towns 
if you were docile and had no 
plans of your own, and did not  
mind spending your life with 
others who had no plans of their 
own.”

Jacobs on Howard’s Influence:

• Sorting city into self-contained uses
• Housing as primary and suburban
• Plan as static and complete
• Planning as paternalistic
“Virtually all modern city planning has been 
adapted from…this silly substance.”

Contemporary City,” (his own design) --
at the same scale.

Jacobs on Le Corbusier:

• Radiant City as high-density Garden City
• Super-block and “project neighborhood”
• Unchangeable Plan
• Empty open space
• Kept pedestrians off streets and in parks

“Immense impact on our cities”

James Scott:  Seeing Like a State

• Brasília as an example of  “Authoritarian 
High Modernism”
rational design of social order
• Relationship of formal order and 
informal processes (metis) 
(adaptability/reflection-in-action/ability to 
out-wit/situated local knowledge)

Jacobs on “City Beautiful”

• Sorting out monuments from the city
• Complete unit, separate and well-defined
