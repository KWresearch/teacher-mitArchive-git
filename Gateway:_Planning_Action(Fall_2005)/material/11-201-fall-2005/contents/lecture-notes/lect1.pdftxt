Briggs/EFFECTIVE TEAMWORK                       

Slide 1

Teamwork or groupwork provides

(cid:131) The chance to practice skills of 
leadership--motivating others to learn, 
deliberate, and act or “produce”;
(cid:131) Incentives to improve self-management 
or “self-mastery.”
(cid:131) A chance to build community around the 
work we do in the Department
(cid:131) A set of challenges for which we can all 
prepare …

Slide 2

Teams have two types of goals

(cid:131) TASK (“getting things done”): Being specific, 
productive, attentive to what’s expected by the 
client or boss or constituents. “Delivering the 
goods.”

(cid:131) RELATIONSHIP (“getting along”): Creating 
interpersonal dynamics that work

Slide 3

What “success” means

In good teams…

(cid:131) Tasks get accomplished; and

(cid:131) The satisfaction of team members is high

Slide 4

Typical team stages

1. Forming (becoming a group, introductions, 
basics)
2. Norming (establishing ground rules and 
working habits)
3. “Storming” (on task, agreeing and 
disagreeing)
4. Performing (Output: delivering the briefing, 
show, project, etc.)

Slide 5

Using disagreement

(cid:131) Diversity of opinion and background can be a 
tremendous resource—a major source of 
innovation, for example—if managed well.
(cid:131) Ineffective teams get anxious about disagreement 
and so converge on mediocre solutions that 
everyone can live with.
(cid:131) Effective teams deliberate, invite opposing views, 
allocate time to develop risky ideas—but within the 
frame of a workplan, with deadlines, etc.

Slide 6

Personal needs

(cid:131) INCLUSION: Info sharing, fairness, 
participation.
(cid:131) CONTROL: No group can perform without it, 
but heavy-handed, myopic control undercuts 
performance, strains relationships.
(cid:131) AFFECTION (Warmth or “affect”): 
encouragement, praise, cooperative spirit.

Slide 7

Using different needs

(cid:131) Different team members contribute 
differently— steering, mediating, encouraging, 
praising, adding comic relief, etc.
(cid:131) Know thyself: Monitoring and managing your 
own needs as a key to self-management.
(cid:131) Know your limits: Engage team members in 
compensating for your style (Impatient? Not 
engaged by details? Forget to appreciate others? 
Uncomfortable asserting boundaries/limits?)

Slide 8

Multiple intelligences

Two of the most critical:
(cid:131) Logical-mathematical (analytic prowess): 
Thinking your way through tough material, 
reasoning logically.
(cid:131) Emotional: Being able to perceive, assess, 
and influence your own emotions as well as 
those of other people.

Slide 9

Some advice (1 of 2)

1. Choose facilitators, who help the group 
use time well and actively engage 
members in discussion and work.
2. Get to know each other’s strengths, 
weaknesses, and style. Be candid, take 
risks.
3. Set ground rules and deadlines, and 
take time outs to check your process 
against them.
4. Discuss and “unpack” the task as an 
early focus of your work.

Slide 10

More advice (2 of 2)

5. Divide and coordinate labor: Don’t just 
allocate, remember to coordinate.
6. Assembling the parts: Compose, 
practice, adjust, practice some more.
7. Present your work: You’ve worked hard, 
now do your best and don’t worry about 
what you can’t change or control.
8. Debrief and feedback: Use faculty and 
peer comments on your work, log some 
lessons for the future.
