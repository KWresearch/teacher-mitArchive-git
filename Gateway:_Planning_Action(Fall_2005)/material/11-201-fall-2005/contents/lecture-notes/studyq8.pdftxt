Reading Tips and Study Questions: For Session 8 

 
 
Case Background: 
 
As one of the largest infrastructure development efforts ever launched, the 
Narmada dam projects were conceived in the 1950s and began to be 
implemented from the 1970s in the western part of India, along one of the 
longest rivers in India. The project consisted of 30 major, 135 medium and 
almost 3000 small dams stretching across three Indian states in the 
Narmada valley. From its inception, the project ran into trouble at various 
levels—most intensely from the people living in the valley, who organized an 
unprecedented national and international campaign to obtain better terms for 
resettlement and even stop some elements of the project.  Despite this 
opposition, the construction of the dams has proceeded, albeit slower than 
planned, resulting in the forced displacement of thousands of tribal people 
and farmers, as well as the flooding of ecologically sensitive areas.  The 
violence of these development projects has particularly and overwhelmingly 
affected socially and economically weaker classes, especially those belonging 
to India’s historically marginalized caste groups.  Through this case study, 
what lessons can we draw about the planning of mega projects in general, 
and the role of planners in ‘Third World’ settings? What is the relationship 
between planners and the intended beneficiaries and victims of the projects?  
Is planning in the ‘Third World’ different, and what is the relationship 
between planning and ‘development’?  To evaluate the answers to these and 
other questions, three frameworks—each of fundamental importance to the 
evolving theory and practice of planning—are applied: planning from below 
(including planning-as-social-mobilization) versus planning from above; 
domestic versus international framing in planning and development (or 
“planning in a global age”), and the role and limits of institutional versus 
non-institutional politics in planning and development. 
 
The Narmada case is complex and there are multiple ways in which one could 
approach it for understanding.  Our approach emphasizes the role of politics, 
institutions and their relationship to planning large development projects of 
this kind.  Not all planning challenges match those of mega-development 
projects of course, but the issues that arise in the project are important and 
revealing about much of development planning.

Tips and questions 
1.  What is Development and what is Planning?  Can we think of development 
as modernity? As nationalism? As exploitation/extraction? As technocratic 
antipolitics? Consider how Kothari and Roy link the critique of the project 
to a broader critique of democracy and the nature of development itself. 
2.  Planning from above: Are mega projects compatible with democracy at 
all?  Should democracy be judged by outcome or process? Think about 
the impact of India’s democratic system on the way the project was 
conceived, planned and implemented and whether democracy led to 
better outcomes, and if so, how we can tell what is better? 
3.  Planning from below: Is mobilization effective and if so how do we judge 
when it is? If social mobilization is an important part of planning from 
below (according to Friedman), whose mobilization and politics matter for 
development?  Did the NBA succeed in attaining its goals and if not, how 
can we explain the outcomes they did achieve such as better terms of 
resettlement and rehabilitation from the Gujarat government in the late 
1980s and compelling the World Bank to pull put its funding, as Khagram 
explains?  
4.  City versus Rural divide: Consider who benefits and loses in the case and 
how we are to judge what benefits and losses are.  Roy explicitly links big 
projects like Narmada with the production of poverty in cities, especially 
the growth of slums.  Are you persuaded?  What methods and scholarly 
frameworks are needed to assess internal displacement and migration and 
should planners learn how to assess such societal impacts? 
5.  The ethnic/racial/caste dimension: Consider the facts about who gets 
displaced due to large development projects and why.  More than 57% of 
the displaced people due to the Sardar Sarovar dam alone, are tribal 
people (India avoids the terms like ‘indigenous’ or ‘native’).  If we include 
the landless laborers, fisherpeople and others who are not officially 
counted as ‘project affected’, the percentage of the population from the 
lowest socio-economic strata of Indian society who are adversely affected 
by the Narmada project may be well over 80%.  Is this ethnic cleansing in 
disguise as Prof. Rajagopal argues?    
6.  Problems of implementation: The project has suffered from several 
lacunae in implementation: for instance, the problems of finding adequate

land for resettlement, keeping communities intact, and ensuring project 
goals are met including through post-project review.  Indeed, in post-
independence India, not even a single dam has been subjected to a 
thorough post-project assessment, even by applying a benefit/cost 
analysis.  Is a project of this size capable of being implemented without 
problems?  Based on the Narmada experience (as you read it), are big 
projects feasible at all, as planned interventions?
