Tips and questions 
 
Debates about planning and human diversity are many and varied, and we 
have seen a few of the classic ones already this semester. First, we looked at 
crisis response and the risks in top-down planning led by a non-
representative group that assumed, rather than developed, a legitimate 
mandate for action (Rebuild Los Angeles case). Next, we considered broad 
participation in planning and the power and limits of physical design to 
counter inter-group inequalities and racial isolation (in Boston public housing 
case). Third, we analyzed a controversial case of planning as a trigger for 
displacing members of historically marginalized and poor caste groups in 
India (Narmada case). Fourth and finally, we thought about how to harness 
the market to promote equitable development—rather than an unchecked, 
exclusionary “growth machine”—in America’s highly segregated capital city, 
where east of the River communities face serious and long-standing social 
and economic barriers (Anacostia case). In all these cases, planning 
struggles even where significant reforms and alternatives are sought, 
because the past casts a long shadow and the future holds risks of its own: 
Mistrust of new plans, and often the planners who bring them, runs deep.

The very brief excerpts on our reading list are designed to introduce you to 
some of the most important debates in planning theory and practice. In 
class, we’ll use focused small-group work and some revealing images to think 
about where planning has come from and where it could go on this front. And 
we may have some prospective students with us (visitors to the DUSP Open 
House), so I hope you’ll help me welcome them to class. - Xav 
 
1.  About two weeks ago, two young men of Arab descent were 
electrocuted—accidentally, say public officials—while being chased by 
police in a Paris suburb that is home to many low-income immigrants. 
Rioting there and in other French cities has claimed lives and injured 
many, and considerable media attention has focused on the social 
conditions in France’s immigrant communities—isolation, unemployment, 
discrimination by the wider society, and more—as well as government 
response. Brooks writes of another facet—the use of “gangsta” images in 
American rap by young people in other countries, including immigrant 
youth in France. How should planners think about or use cultural symbols, 
especially in an era of rapid global exchange? 

2.  What are the blindspots in planning research that Briggs underlines, and, 
in the “Looking for a common code” section, what key risks and 
opportunities does he identify for planning practice? 

3.  Sandercock draws a distinction between the planning system itself being 
grounded in, or biased to suit, a dominant culture and the planning 
system being used by one group to control the behavior of another. Which 
of these does her brief case example of the Buddhist temple in suburban 
Melbourne reflect? 

4.  Fainstein argues for an approach to the city that “does not privilege 
difference over other goods,” a focus on capacities and the creation of 
collective identity (through “the just city”). She further worries that a 
focus on diversity, far from making democracy more vibrant, can 
undermine it. What, in your view, are the most compelling and 
constructive elements of her central argument? And what are the riskiest? 
What’s left unexplained?
