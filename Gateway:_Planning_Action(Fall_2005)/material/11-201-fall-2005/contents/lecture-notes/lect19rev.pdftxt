GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 1

Today’s learning objectives

1. Review main ideas: Planning’s origins and 
dilemmas + what is “the field”?
2. Compare contexts for planning, using the 
cases.
Identify some resources for learning 
more—especially about tactics for creative 
work.

3.

Slide 2

Main ideas: Fundamental questions

(cid:131) Ends: What defines the good society? 
Economic gain, human “freedom” defined by 
capabilities (Sen), something else?
(cid:131) What are the most effective means of 
intervention? Does “effective” include 
legitimate?
(cid:131) Who decides and how?

GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 3

Key Dilemmas in “planning action”

(cid:131) Place and society: The power and limits of physical design
(cid:131) Unleashing vs. taming the market (e.g. equitable 
development)
(cid:131) Planning from “above” vs. “below” (democracy, advocacy, 
participation)
(cid:131) Planning knowledge: Trained professional vs. “indigenous”
experts.
(cid:131) Comprehensiveness vs. incrementalism
(cid:131) The role of identity (human diversity)

GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 4

Dilemmas are tricky things

(cid:131) Defined: “A situation in which somebody 
must choose one of two or more 
unsatisfactory alternatives”
(cid:131) “Solutions” versus “resolutions.”
(cid:131) Resolutions versus denial (even 
questions are guides to action).
(cid:131) Need to identify some approaches to 
resolutions, even partial ones.

GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 5

Action requires actors: Who plans?

(cid:131) Trained professional planners with job 
titles that say “Planner”
(cid:131) Professionals who plan but without the 
title
(cid:131) Others who plan, especially civil society 
advocates (nongovernmental, private)
(cid:131) Grassroots vs. “grasstops”
(cid:131) Others who shape what is planned (stop 
or change what professionals propose)

GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 6

The first “school” of modern planning

Saint-Simon/Comte, according to 
Friedmann:
(cid:131) Rigid, functional division of labor: 
“Theoretician-planners” and administrators vs. 
everyone else.
(cid:131) Politics as “inconsequential,” not a “guiding 
force”—trumped by immutable scientific laws, 
including “social physics.”
(cid:131) Addressed to “the rulers of society.”
(cid:131) This is the origin and orientation of modernist
planning: technocratic, self-assured.

Slide 7

But in reality …

(cid:131) Huge erosion of faith in government (in North and South).
(cid:131) Fuzzy division of labor, overlapping expertise, uncertainty 
common, science an incomplete guide (values debates 
often unavoidable), communication failures, 
unrecognized problems appear.
(cid:131) Planners must build support for their ideas, participate in 
the political process to identify target problems, generate 
options and criteria, implement.
(cid:131) Many official planners merely “permit”
(cid:131) Many plans sit on shelves: Ideas without constituents.
(cid:131) Planning not always attached to the state, let alone the 
elite (“rulers”). Not always “guidance” from above.

GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 8

And …

“Postmodern” planning is clear about what it 
seeks to replace (technocratic modernism), 
not always clear on how:
(cid:131) How to ensure accountability if traditional 
government recipes are inadequate?
(cid:131) How to reconcile conflicting values?
(cid:131) How to ‘manage co-existence’ in the context of 
social diversity?  

GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 9

Two approaches

Resolve dilemmas in context: Boston public 
housing: Physical planning as cause and 
effect of community engagement, 
“community building” (new capacity to 
problem-solve), not a grand political reform.

GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 10

Approaches continued

(cid:131) Resolve in context (second example): 
Narmada dam: New institutions and 
standards to guide many projects and 
enhance accountability, not a project fix.
(cid:131) Or: Partially resolve the dilemmas, as 
best you can, within particular planning 
roles.

Some (sort of) specific roles

GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 13

And more roles …

In the context of recognizing diversity:
(cid:131) Cultural historian: Relating group 
histories, journeys.
(cid:131) Informal anthropologist: Understanding 
deeper values and meanings, based on 
what’s on the surface.
(cid:131) Communication specialist: Interpreting 
talk, negotiating norms of dialogue.

GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 14

Role conflicts and confusion

(cid:131) Defend technical standards vs. popular ones? Not 
all popular ideas are wise, not all wise ones are 
popular or legitimate.
(cid:131) Educate but also advocate?
(cid:131) Answer to the client or employer vs. constituents, 
the marginalized?
(cid:131) Equipped to play multiple roles? (skills and 
personal resources)

GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 15

Interpreting a job description

(cid:131) What’s the unofficial (de facto) role(s)?
(cid:131) Who will I deal with over what issues?
(cid:131) What conflicts define this role(s)?
(cid:131) What are this organization’s strategic 
challenges? What is hardest about 
advancing its mission?

Slide 16

Planners in the cases

(cid:131) Boston public housing redevelopment:
(cid:131) Physical and social planners at Housing Authority
(cid:131) Physical planners at City planning agency

organizations

(cid:131) Physical planners at public agencies
(cid:131) Social planners at other agencies
(cid:131) Planners working for private and nonprofit organizations or 
informal civic groups.

GATEWAY: Planning Action                       

Slide 17

Or: Resolve via a particular definition of 
success (partial definitions)

(cid:131) The outcome is sustainable (growth, equity, 
environment, engagement) and enhances 
“freedoms” (Sen).
(cid:131) The process was effective (produced the 
desired output or outcome)
(cid:131) The process built trust and capacity for more 
collective action
(cid:131) The stakeholders—All? Some? A majority? A 
targeted subgroup?—are satisfied
