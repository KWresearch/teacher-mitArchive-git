Assignment #1 
WRITING DIAGNOSTIC, DUE MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 12th 

An “action memo” to the new head of Rebuild Los Angeles 

An action or decision memo recommends action(s), based on analysis. 
Informational or options memos simply analyze a situation and/or outline action 
options—but not recommendations. We will discuss these and other types of 
professional writing in the Professional Communications Workshop (Part Two) on 
Friday, September 16th. 

The setting and your role. It’s Los Angeles, late 1993. You’ve been working 
for the past few weeks as a Special Assistant to Linda Griego, the new President 
and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Rebuild LA. RLA has weathered some 
turbulent politics of late, with elected officials sharply criticizing former CEO 
Peter Ueberroth in a packed meeting at City Hall. In response and frustration, 
Ueberroth told the elected officials “You don’t get it … pretty soon you should 
get it”—a comment that was, shall we say, not well received by most City 
officials or by the public, once the press got hold of it. You’re helping Griego to 
redirect RLA’s work and rebuild its damaged credibility, and your “portfolio” of 
responsibilities is broad and still evolving. Griego has publicly announced the 
intention to invest much more of RLA’s time, energy, and funds in the needs of 
businesses—most of them small firms—directly affected by the riots last year. 
Staff will be cut, and “outreach” efforts spun off (reduced and/or handed off to 
another organization), but no one knows exactly what that means yet. Griego 
has spent the first few weeks gathering information, not committing— 
prematurely, in her view—to specifics. 

The task. After a long day discussing neighborhood economic development 
plans with city staff and local nonprofit groups—and then sitting in rush-hour 
traffic!—you get back to the office to find this note from Griego, who couldn’t 
reach you by phone. Apparently, she had to fly cross-country, a few hours ago, 
on a family matter: 

Hope the meetings went well today. Now that you’ve been at this a few 
weeks, I could use some analysis from you by time I get back to LA. As 
you know, I’ve promised that RLA will stop “chasing” big companies and 
their investments, at least as its main line of work, and instead will focus 
on the businesses affected by the riots. But we also need a strategy for 
leveraging the new work to restore a positive reputation with City Hall, 
community leaders, and others. We’re too visible an organization to 
simply become a dedicated business assistance program that drifts 
quietly into the background. So I need you to help me decide how I 
should focus this organization for the next six months? Don’t laundry list 
programs for me. I need advice on how to define our strategy publicly 
(what to say, what to emphasize, and to whom—which stakeholders),

also on how to best deploy the talented staff and other assets we have 
for maximum impact. Get me a 500-word memo, with your analysis and 
recommendations, by 10AM Monday, and we’ll discuss it further from 
there. Thanks - LG 

1. 	 Write a 500-word memo that responds to Griego’s request, and 
upload it to the MIT server by 10AM, Monday, September 12th, in 
the “Homework” section, under “September 12 – Session Two.” 

2. 	 How your writing will be assessed: Before you write, read the next page 
(“guidelines”). 

3. 	 Formatting. Double-space your memo, and use one-inch margins and a 12 (cid:173)
point font. Most busy decision-makers don’t like to read “micro-print” 
crowded onto the page, and they often like to scribble their thoughts in the 
margins. While most professional memos are single-spaced, the double-
spacing will leave us more room to make comments. 

4. 	 A memo is a brief communication from you to  someone else, not an 
impersonal statement or report. Use a memo format: 

Date: September 12, 2005 

To: 
Linda Griego, CEO 

From: [Your name], 11.201 Gateway (Fall 2005) 

Subject: Recommendations you requested (RLA Strategy)  


5. 	 Include a summary paragraph as your first paragraph. It should 
summarize your recommendations and the basis for them (your analysis). 
That’s right: You give your conclusions first, not last (as you might in an 
academic paper), and then the body of the memo develops the arguments to 
support the summary.  Include the summary in the first paragraph, but make 
it the last thing you write.  

6. 	 Avoid rehashing the case background. Just give the reader enough on 
your assumptions and premises that your arguments will make sense. Draw 
only on the video case and our discussion of it. No one expects you to do 
additional research in order to learn more about the events. 

7. 	 Details, details: Be sure to spell check, word count, and proofread 
your work before submitting. It is a professional product, not a note for 
your own use or a casual message to a colleague. Being careless about 
content or format sends the wrong signal to the person who requested your 
writing. If you find you “need” an extra 25-50 words to make your points, 
then you’ve written too much. Go back and condense your key ideas and cut 
the non-essentials. Never submit a memo that’s too long, late, or off point in 
its content.

Guidelines for scoring: Graduate writing skills 

Your first written assignment will not be graded, but you will receive a score to 
help us assess your strengths and weaknesses as a writer. That is, the score will 
be for teaching use and your use, not a part of your course grade. 

1.  The memo will receive a score, 1-6 (6 is highest). 
2.  Use of the passive voice is acceptable in social science and technical 
writing, so long as it does not interfere with, intrude upon, or obscure 
the meaning of the passage.  The active voice tends to read better and 
be more engaging. 
3.  This is a test of writing. The content will likely add to the strength of the 
essay but will not be graded. 

4-6 Point essays are considered upper-half 

A six point essay will be characterized by the following: 
Excellent organization of ideas 
Clarity and conciseness 
Be virtually error-free in grammar and usage 

A five point essay will: 
Display the features of a 6-point essay, but be slightly weaker in clarity, 
concision, and organization. 

A four point essay will be characterized by the following: 
Basic competence in grammar and usage 
Lacks the structural and organizational sophistication of a 5 or 6 point 
essay 

1-3 Point essays are considered lower-half 

A three point essay will be characterized by the following: 
Overly formulaic organization or lacking organization 
Problems with grammar and usage 
Vague and wordy construction (excessive use of passive voice, excessive 
nominalization) 

A two point essay will compound the problems of a three point essay, and 
display: 
Consistent flaws in syntax, diction, grammar, or spelling 
Significant flaws in organization and a lack of overall coherence; 
Usage of terms without prior definition 

A one point essay will compound the weaknesses of a two point essay.
