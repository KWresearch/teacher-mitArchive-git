GROUP ASSIGNMENT: Case 1 

How do Design, Planning, and Policy Matter 
in Public Housing Redevelopment? 

 
Be sure to read the entire assignment document, regardless of your group 
number. 
 
Groups 1, 2, and 3 
 

Your groups have been appointed by Thomas Menino, the Mayor of 
Boston, to staff the Task Force on the Future of Public Housing.  Each group 
includes staff members from the Boston Housing Authority, the planning 
division of the Boston Redevelopment Authority, and the Department of 
Neighborhood Development, as well as social service staff from other 
agencies. But the Mayor has stressed that the group’s work should reflect the 
best-available evidence, and your candid analysis, not agency viewpoints. So 
don’t feel the need to defend any particular agency or interest group in your 
work or to research the agencies themselves. 
 
Given uncertainties about the future of funding for public housing 
redevelopment as well as ongoing misperceptions about the current state of 
public housing in the city, the Mayor wants to know what housing authority 
planners should do next.   In particular, he wants to know what issues matter 
most when trying to assess “success” in public housing redevelopment and 
therefore has requested analysis of several past efforts. 
 
The Mayor has asked each group to prepare a 20-minute 
briefing that analyzes the lessons of a single redevelopment case (see 
below) for (a) the role of physical design in redevelopment success; and (b) 
the optimal role for planners in public housing redevelopment.  What is the 
best mix of physical and non-physical planning interventions to ensure 
effective redevelopment?  What kinds of planning policies can best promote 
this mix? In addition, you should prepare a briefing summary—a report 
in miniature—of no more than 500 words, to summarize your analysis and 
recommendations. Think of it as the executive summary to a report you don’t 
have to write out in detail. Use the concise, clear writing style of an action 
memo. Double space it, and leave ample margins. You may include a cover 
sheet with all group members’ names and a project title. Bring a dozen 
copies of this document to the briefing to use as handouts for Task Force 
members and other guests. 
 
To help organize your briefing, it may also help to review the questions 
posed to those who are writing individual assignments, since these raise

particular issues about the role of race, physical design, and professional vs. 
indigenous knowledge in planning. Do not concern yourself with the formal 
authority of the Mayor’s Task Force or other jurisdictional issues that were 
not in the case material provided. 
 

Your primary audience will be the Task Force members themselves—a 
relatively diverse group that includes two local philanthropists, a former 
editor of The Boston Globe newspaper, two respected real estate developers, 
a university professor who works on housing and urban policy issues, the 
retired head of a local civil rights organization that has long represented 
African-Americans in the city, and the heads of three nonprofit community-
based development organizations active in Boston neighborhoods. In 
addition, the head of the Boston Housing Authority and the Mayor himself 
might also attend, as well as other public officials and civic activists. While 
not officially a public meeting, the Mayor feels that a transparent process is 
important for the Task Force’s work, so even this early working meeting of 
the Task Force will not turn away interested others who may wish to hear 
what you have to say. While it’s often hard to predict how interactive the 
audience will be, expect at least a few Task Force members to interrupt, ask 
for specifics, or challenge you on your claims. They might also argue (a bit) 
with each other. Good luck!

Groups 4 and 5:  Cross-Site Analysis of Public Housing 
Redevelopment Policy 
 
 
Your groups have been invited by Thomas Menino, the Mayor of 
Boston, to add national perspectives on redevelopment issues and choices. 
Your groups each consist of two former affordable housing developers (now 
working as planning consultants), the former public housing redevelopment 
director for a housing authority, a former tenant of public housing in Chicago 
(now consulting on redevelopment issues around the country), and a senior

redevelopment projects. 
 

You will be briefing the Task Force (see above), and the context 
outlined above applies: Given uncertainties about the future of funding for 
public housing redevelopment as well as ongoing misperceptions about the 
current state of public housing in the city, the Mayor wants to know what 
housing authority planners should do next.   In particular, he wants to know 
what issues matter most when trying to assess “success” in public housing 
redevelopment. 
 
The Mayor understands that the redevelopment efforts at West 
 
Broadway, Franklin Field, and Commonwealth represent the ‘state of the art 
thinking’ of the 1980s and early 1990s.  Since then, however, there has been 
something of a backlash against efforts to re-invest heavily in low-income 
public housing communities.  Instead, under the federal HOPE VI program 
established in 1993, more than $5.5 billion has been allocated to what has 
slowly evolved into a new paradigm.  Boston has completed two of these 
HOPE VI projects (at Mission Main and Orchard Gardens), is partway through 
a third one (Maverick Gardens), and is applying for a fourth grant.   
 
Compared to many cities where local officials have used HOPE VI to 
markedly reduce the numbers of extremely-low-income households served 
by public housing, Boston planners have endeavored to resist much of the 
impulse to gentrify neighborhoods.  Nationwide, however, HOPE VI policy 
now generally entails wholesale demolition of housing developments, and 
their replacement by mixed-income communities in which public housing 
residents are the minority.  On average, one study found, only 11 percent of 
those public housing residents who were displaced by plans to construct a 
HOPE VI development have received (or are scheduled to receive) an 
apartment in the new development.  The Mayor wants to know whether 
public housing should continue to primarily serve extremely-low-income 
households, or whether this “concentration of poverty” is the primary cause 
of public housing’s failure and something to be avoided in the future. 
 
The Mayor has asked each group to prepare a 20-minute 
briefing that addresses the following questions, based (at least in part) on 
the experience of Boston: Should planners advocate that public housing 
developments be returned to their origins as communities composed 
primarily of upwardly-mobile working-class families instead of dominated by 
extremely-low-income households with high unemployment?  Should public 
housing remain a resource for those with the fewest housing options?  
Conversely, how should decisionmakers address the needs of those public 
housing residents who are forced out of their homes by HOPE VI policies that 
seek to impose “mixed-income” communities?  In general, which people 
should the city choose to serve through ambitious, complex, and often 
conflict-ridden redevelopment efforts?
