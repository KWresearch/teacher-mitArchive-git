GROUP ASSIGNMENT: CASE 3 

 
 

 

The Growth Machine and the Public Interest:  
Reinventing the Anacostia Waterfront in Washington, DC. 

 
Be sure to read the entire assignment document, regardless of your group 
number. 
 
The context. Recently, Andy Altman announced his resignation as Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) of the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation (AWC), and 
new leadership has just been announced.  The incoming CEO comes to the 
AWC as it prepares for its next phase—crossing the Anacostia River and 
attempting to spur economic growth “east of the river” (as the area is 
commonly known in DC).  The incoming CEO is from the Washington region 
and knows the general landscape of the city, but is not familiar with 
Anacostia. He knows neither the job skills of residents east of the river or the 
physical state and economic potential of the neighborhoods (note, 
“Anacostia” and “east of the river” refer to the same area).   
 
The new CEO has just attended a national planning conference in which 
Policy Link, an action-oriented think tank based in California, presented their 
“Equitable Development Framing Plan.”  In this light, the incoming CEO 
would like to reevaluate some existing projects of the AWC and identify 
promising new strategies as well.   
 
The task. He has gathered the AWC staff to brief him on the role that the 
corporation can play in providing equitable development to Anacostia.  He 
has asked each group to prepare a 20-minute briefing on a particular 
strategy within the five areas of equitable development that he finds most 
crucial to AWC’s mission: environmental justice, transportation, housing, 
workforce development, and business development. 
 
The first two groups (see below) will evaluate current AWC strategies (and 
associated projects) to determine whether the AWC should continue working 
on them, and if so, whether any changes are needed in the projects’ overall 
direction or implementation.  The other three groups will propose new 
strategies and projects that reflect the new phase of AWC’s development.  
 
Each briefing should define successful equitable development in the context 
of the policy area being discussed, identify the stakeholders affected by 
development strategies, recommend strategies, and identify the coalitions 
needed to drive AWC’s agenda in the that particular policy area 
(transportation, housing, etc.).  Be sure to analyze both Anacostia-specific 
concerns and how the neighborhood should fit into citywide and, where 

appropriate, regional strategies and development patterns. That is, pay 
attention to Anacostia as the focus, but don’t fall into the trap of thinking 
that it can prosper in isolation from the surrounding city-region and its 
economy—or, conversely, that Anacostia is insulated from shocks in the 
wider city-region. 
 
In addition to the oral briefing, you should prepare a briefing 
summary – a report in miniature – of no more than 500 words, to 
summarize your analysis and recommendations.  Think of it as the executive 
summary to a report you don’t have to write out in detail.  Use the concise, 
clear writing style of an action memo.  Double space it, and leave ample 
margins.  You may include a cover sheet with all the group members’ names 
and a project title.  Bring six copies of this document to the briefing to use as 
handouts for the new CEO and the one or two members of the city council 
and AWC board of directors who may also attend.  Don’t forget to hand them 
out before your briefing begins! Handouts are not to be handed in after the 
fact.

Groups 10 and 11: Evaluating Current Strategies 
 
Evaluate the following policies based on your definition of equitable 
development as relates to these broader issues.  Should the AWC continue to 
pursue this project?  If so, should it alter any parts of its strategy, and what 
other elements of a broad revitalization strategy should the project support 
(or drive)?1 If not, are there alternative policies or projects that the AWC 
should research? 
 
Group 10.  Environmental Justice  
 
The Anacostia River is at the center of AWC plans.  Currently, it is a polluted, 
filthy river that suffers from years of neglect.  A variety of local and federal 
agencies have committed to making the river okay for swimming by 2025.  
The clean-up involves youth education, community input for river uses, and 
AWC development.  Before the AWC, DC Appleseed coordinated early efforts 
for river cleanup and proposed legislation to Congress. In the context of 

                                       
1 For example, transportation logically links to workforce development and vice-
versa. It’s not the task of each group to plan comprehensively. But each group 
should highlight the issue links that seem most crucial to implementation success, 
whether from a programmatic or political standpoint. 

equitable development and AWC’s potential, do DC Appleseed’s plans 
adequately incorporate the needs of the existing Anacostia community?

Group 11.  Transportation 
 
DC has a model public transportation system that relies on buses and a well-
utilized subway system.  However, the subway system only takes Anacostia 
residents downtown, and does not provide a way to travel within Anacostia.  
A light rail line has been planned to connect the neighborhoods east of the 
river.  As plans have developed, the route has shifted away from the river 
and into the neighborhoods.  In the context of equitable development and 
AWC’s potential, is a light rail likely to be the least disruptive and most 
effective way to connect these communities to public transportation? These

Groups 12, 13, and 14: New Strategies 
 
The incoming CEO of the AWC does not want to limit himself to projects that 
have already begun.  He has asked you to evaluate whether the prospective 
strategies outlined below are appropriate as part of an equitable 
development approach east of the river, and if so, to provide specific 
recommendations about how to implement.  Also let the incoming CEO know 
what data are needed and what questions must be answered to fully analyze 
these strategies. 
 
Group 12. Inclusionary Housing  
 
The real estate market in DC is among the strongest in the country.  Both 
commercial and residential prices have been soaring for the last few years, 
and show no signs of slowing down.  The high level of housing demand has 
made it difficult for many DC residents to access affordable housing.  In 
addition, several neighborhoods have undergone gentrification and priced out 
previous residents.  Anacostia currently has high levels of public and assisted 
housing (for low income households) but has also had recent market-rate 
construction aimed at a higher income bracket.  The AWC would like to 
promote a housing strategy that does not concentrate low-income housing in 
the troubled neighborhoods of Anacostia but also does not price out existing 
residents as the AWC brings new economic development.  Would inclusionary 
zoning benefit current Anacostia residents? These supplementary materials

Group 13. Workforce Development 
 
The AWC is attracting employers to the Anacostia waterfront.  Moreover, the 
DC area has a thriving economy with a number of growing sectors.  As the 
government increasingly subcontracts to private firms, industries are finding 
it helpful to locate near the federal government.  At the same time, Anacostia 
struggles with high levels of unemployment, low levels of education, and a 
variety of barriers for residents to access work.  For example, 37 percent of 

adults in DC are functionally illiterate, and the share is much higher east of 
the river.   How can the AWC help link Anacostia residents to the growing 
employment opportunities nearby—for example, along the Anacostia 
Waterfront—and throughout the strong regional economy? These

Group 14.  Economic Development (Business Development – Retail) 
 
Residents of neighborhoods east of the river have complained for many years 
that they are not adequately served by local retail.  Nationwide, 
neighborhoods in which residents feel compelled to meet key retail needs 
outside the neighborhood (through so-called “out-shopping”) often have two 
related problems: an overall shortage of retail options and low quality among 
the options available (relative to the wider economy of the city-region). 
Anacostia residents have no local grocery store, almost no sit-down 
restaurants, and a dearth of other stores.  Now, some equitable development 
advocates have identified models of community-oriented retail development. 
In San Diego, for example, a foundation and local residents worked together 
to create a locally owned retail center for the community.  This project, 
Market Creek, has been hailed nationally as a successful model for local 
economic development.  Could a project of this kind be carried out in 
Anacostia?  What challenges would such a project be likely to face? These
