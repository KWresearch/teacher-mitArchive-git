INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNMENT: CASE 3 

 
 

 

The Growth Machine and the Public Interest:  
Reinventing the Anacostia Waterfront in Washington, DC. 
 

 
Turn in your memo to no later than 10AM, Lecture 15.  Unexcused late 
submissions will be penalized, so please make any extension requests in 
advance. 
 
Context:  Andy Altman has announced that he is resigning as Chief Executive 
Officer (CEO) of the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation (AWC), and new leadership 
has just been announced.  The incoming CEO comes to the AWC as it prepares for 
its next phase of development.  The corporation is crossing the Anacostia River and 
attempting to spur economic empowerment east of the river.  The incoming CEO is 
from the Washington region and knows the general landscape of the city, but is not 
familiar with Anacostia. He knows neither the job skills of residents east of the river 
or the physical state and potential of the neighborhoods.   
 
The CEO recognizes that he is entering a politically charged arena.  Two council 
members have already tried to shape his agenda with these statements to the 
press: 
 

“Anacostia is not DC’s downtown.  It doesn’t need any pretty new buildings 
to attract the wealthy and price out the poor.  It needs social programs for 
the people who already live there. It’s time to empower, not displace.” 

 

“The physical overhaul of near Southeast should extend east of the river.  
Only with this kind of dramatic redesign can we create vibrant neighborhoods 
with activity and eyes on the street.  We should not sell Anacostia residents 
short, leaving them behind in our city’s new construction.” 

 
The CEO wants to address the seemingly opposing concerns of these council 
members, but he does not want to offer political generalities.  Instead, he wants to 
offer a plan that is motivated by the substance and mechanisms of equitable 
development. 
 
The Task: Please prepare an action memo, of no more that 1,500 words, 
addressed to the incoming CEO of the AWC, that proposes two specific projects for 
the AWC in its next phase of development.  The first project, says the CEO, should 
be short-term and help build trust among the stakeholders.  The second, a long-
term project, might take years to complete but should achieve the larger goals of 
the AWC.   
 

In addition, prepare a press release of no more than 250 words that announces the 
two projects that you have just recommended. 
 
So the task is in two parts: an action memo and an attached draft press 
release. But you should submit a single document that includes both.  
 
In your memo, place your project recommendations within a framework of 
equitable development.  What does equitable development mean in the context of 
Anacostia?  What political and economic constraints face residents east of the river?  
Are certain types of businesses or policies particularly relevant to Anacostia 
residents?  Who are the stakeholders involved in this development, and what 
coalitions are necessary to drive AWC’s agenda? 
 
Clearly, you have not been given the data to perform a formal market analysis or 
other feasibility analyses, but try to justify your proposed projects in terms of what 
you have learned about the economy and politics of DC and the Anacostia 
neighborhood. As always, we will be looking for coherent arguments and 
appropriate, professional attention to political perceptions—rather than technical 
validity per se. 
 
Format. Please double-space your memo and press release, and use ample 
margins (at least an inch on all sides). As always, no micro-print, please: Assume a 
busy reader. Use your word processing software to count the number of words in 
your document, and place that number below the text, i.e. on the last page (e.g. 
“Memo word count = 1,495 words” and “Press release word count = 237 words”). 
As with any professional workproduct, be concise and clear, and provide an 
effective summary up front. Don’t formally cite sources unless you use a direct 
quote, in which case make it brief, and simply footnote the source.
