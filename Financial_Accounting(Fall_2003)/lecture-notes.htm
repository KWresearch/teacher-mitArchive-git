<p>This section of the session road map below specifies the learning objectives you should achieve through (a) the assigned readings and homework, (b) the class discussion or lecture, or (c) the weekly T.A. session (if needed). Periodically, it also summarizes key concepts. You and your group can gauge your progress by assessing the extent to which you have met these objectives and understand the concepts.&lt;</p>
<h2 class="subhead">Class Preparation Questions</h2>
<p>As these problems are related to the class discussion and often will be used as the basis of class discussion, they should receive your utmost attention. You may find it valuable to discuss these with your group members before class. Some questions refer to the Intel 2002 Annual Report, which is available for download from the Intel Web site.

            <br />
            2. What does a firm's ending balance of Retained Earnings represent? In Figure 4-11 on p. 167 of Pratt, Why does Net Income appear on both the Income Statement AND the Statement of Retained Earnings? Why does Ending Retained Earnings Balance not equal Ending Cash Balance on the Balance Sheet?</p>
            <p>3. How do you determine what fiscal period a firm is using? Why would companies use something other than calendar year as a fiscal period?<br />
            <br />
            4. From a financial reporting perspective, what's the difference between consistency and uniformity? Why do U.S. accounting principles require the former but not the latter?<br />

            <br />
            a. On 1/1/90, CC sells a stereo for $1,000 cash. Cost of inventory is $900. Customer also pays $100 cash for 2-year warranty coverage, which CC expects to require $20 in parts and labor over that period (through 12/31/91).<br />
            <br />
            b. 12/90, the customer brings the stereo in for inspection. Actual cost to CC is $8.<br />

            3. How will Circuit City's financial statements be affected if the FASB requires them to change the accounting treatment for extended warranty and product maintenance contracts? What additional information or assumptions would you need to estimate the dollar impact of this change?<br />
