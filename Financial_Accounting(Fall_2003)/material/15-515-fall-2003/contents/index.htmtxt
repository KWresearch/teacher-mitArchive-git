***** Course Description *****
Our goal is to help you develop a framework for understanding financial,
managerial, and tax reports. The course goal is divided into five subordinate
challenges that can help you organize the way you learn accounting:
   1. The record keeping and reporting challenge
   2. The computation challenge
   3. The judgment challenge
   4. The usage challenge
   5. The search challenge
The course adopts a decision-maker perspective of accounting by emphasizing the
relation between accounting data and the underlying economic events generating
them. Restricted to first-year Sloan MBA students.
