 ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES 
•  Permanent Differences: 
•  Scope differences 
•  Differences between financial statement (“pretax”) GAAP income and taxable income 
that will never be recaptured/reversed, e.g. Government Fines, Tax-Exempt Revenue. 
•  Temporary Timing Differences – Differences between pretax GAAP income and taxable 
income that will be recaptured/reversed at some point in the future. Temporary 
differences create Deferred Tax Liabilities and Deferred Tax Assets 
•  Deferred Tax Liabilities (DTL) 
•  Taxable Income < Pretax GAAP Income  
•  Taxes Payable < GAAP Income Tax Expense 
•  Taxpayer pays lower taxes today. A liability must be recorded to account for the added 
taxes to be paid at some point in the future. 
•  Deferred Tax Asset (DTA) 
•  Taxable Income > Pretax GAAP Income  
•  Taxes Payable > GAAP Income Tax Expense 
•  Taxpayer pays higher taxes today. An asset must be recorded to account for the value of 
lower taxes to be paid at some point in the future.
