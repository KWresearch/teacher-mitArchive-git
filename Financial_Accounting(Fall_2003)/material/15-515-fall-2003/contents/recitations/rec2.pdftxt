QUICK REVIEW/MUST KNOW!! 
¶  Principles of Financial Accounting Measurement 
Financial accounting information must be verifiable and 
neutral/unbiased.  
 
Are the following transactions recorded correctly?: 
−  Record advertising expenses as an asset and depreciate it over 20 years. 
 
 
 
− Mark up the land value on the Balance Sheet at year-end to reflect an 
increased market value of the land.

¶  Matching principle: 
−  Costs are matched against the benefits that result from them. 
−  First step in applying the principle is deciding when to recognize the 
related benefit (i.e. revenue) 
−  Revenues are booked when assets are created (or liabilities are 
discharged) and expenses are recorded when liabilities arise (or assets are 
reduced)

Principle of revenue recognition: Earned and Realizable 
−  Company must have produced a significant portion of the sales effort. 
−  The amount of revenue can be objectively measured. 
−  The major portion of costs has been incurred and the remaining costs can 
be reasonably estimated. 
−  The eventual collection of cash is reasonably assured. 

 

 

How should the following transactions be recorded? 
 

−  An order by fax is received. 

 

−  An order is shipped from England to a customer in Iraq which has very 
strict price controls (thereby making ultimate price uncertain).

Accounts Receivable / Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  
 

-  Accounts Receivable (AR) must be recorded at net realizable value 
o This requires an estimate of uncollectible accounts, which is 
represented by the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts (ADA) 
o Bad debts can be estimated in one of two ways: 
1) %-of-Sales – estimate based on  current period sales 
2) Aging Schedule – estimate based analysis of period-end receivables 
 
- Gross AR – ADA = Net AR 
-  Estimated bad debt expense increases ADA (reducing net AR) 
-  Write-offs occur when the bad debt actually occurs, decreasing ADA and 
deceasing gross AR (no impact on net AR)
