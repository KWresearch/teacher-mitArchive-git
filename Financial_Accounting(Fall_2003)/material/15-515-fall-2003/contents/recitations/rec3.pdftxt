Revenue Recognition 

KEY QUESTIONS 

•  Has revenue been earned? 
•  e.g. warranty, deferred revenue/income, discounts, price protection 
policies 

•  If sales are on credit, is the cash collectible? 

CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION


•  A significant portion of the production and sales effort has been 
completed 
•  The amount of revenue can be objectively measured 
•  The major portion of the costs has been incurred, and the remaining costs 
can be reasonably estimated 
•  The eventual collection of cash is reasonably assured
