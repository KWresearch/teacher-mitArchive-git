LONG-TERM LIABILITIES – LONG-TERM DEBT 
Terminology 
(cid:121) Par Value: stated or face value of the bond; the amount due at maturity 
(cid:121) Coupon Rate: the rate used to determine the periodic cash payments, if any. (Also called the “Stated 
Rate” in the book.) This rate is stated as the annual amount. 
(cid:121) Current Market Interest Rate: the rate used to determine the current market value of the bond.  It is 
based on market conditions and risk characteristics of the borrower.   
(cid:121) Market Rate of interest at issuance:  the rate used to determine the proceeds received by the firm when 
the bond is issued.  This rate is also used to determined interest expense.  (Also called the “Effective 
Rate” in the book.) 
(cid:121) Coupon Payment: Cash Interest Payment = Par Value x Coupon Rate 
(cid:121) Interest Expense: Interest Expense = Book value of bond x Market Interest Rate at issuance 
(cid:121) Zero-Coupon Bond: Bond with Coupon Rate of 0% 
Bonds - Par/Discount/Premium (Be sure you understand bonds sold at Par, and Zero-Coupon Bonds.)

b Interest Expense = Net Bond Liability x Market Rate of interest at issuance 
           = (Bond Payable + Premium (Discount) Balance) x Market Rate of interest at issuance 
c Discount Accrual = Interest Expense (only for Zero-coupon bonds)
