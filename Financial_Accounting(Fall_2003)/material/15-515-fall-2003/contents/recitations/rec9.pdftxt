15.515 Recitation 9 
LONG-TERM LIABILITIES – LEASES 
Terminology 
y	 Operating Lease - lessee rents the property. Lessee charges rent expenses as they become due in each 
period. 
y	 Capital Lease - lessee essentially owns the property. Lessee records the leased asset in the balance 
sheet (i.e. capitalized) together with the corresponding lease obligation.  During the term of the lease, 
lessee charges depreciation expenses and interest expenses. 

Criteria for lease capitalization 
A lease is considered a capital lease if ANY of the following conditions apply: 
y	 Essential transfer of ownership at the end of lease term - No payment for leased asset, or Bargain 
purchase option (BPT) (Payment below market value after the lease term) 
y	 Minimum present value of lease payments (including BPO, if any) at least 90% of asset's market 
value 
y	 Lease term is 75% of asset's remaining useful life - Bargain renewal option (BRO) - renewal of the 
lease for a rental below the expected fair market rental value, essentially extending the life of a lease

If lease is a Capital Lease 
•	 Accounting is similar to acquiring an asset with a 100% debt financing. 
•	 Any payment in advance is recorded as an immediate reduction in the lease liability. 
•	 During the lease, interest (based on the market rate at lease inception) and depreciation 
expense are recognized. 
•	 When the lease terminates, the lease obligation is zero and Leased Property - Acc. 
Depr. = 0
