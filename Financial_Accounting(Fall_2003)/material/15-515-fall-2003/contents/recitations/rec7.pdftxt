LONG-TERM LIABILITIES – LONG-TERM DEBT 
Terminology 
(cid:121)  Par Value: stated or face value of the bond; the amount due at maturity 
(cid:121)  Coupon Rate: the rate used to determine the periodic cash payments, if any. (Also called the “Stated 
Rate” in the book.) This rate is stated as the annual amount. 
(cid:121)  Current Market Interest Rate: the rate used to determine the current market value of the bond (Price 
to purchase bond current).  It is based on market conditions and risk characteristics of the borrower.  
This rate is stated as the annual amount. 
(cid:121)  Market Rate of interest at issuance:  the rate used to determine proceeds received by the firm when 
the bond is issued.  This rate is used to determine interest expense.  (Also called the “Effective Rate” 
in the book.) 
(cid:121)  Book value of bond:  Sometimes also called the “Net bond payable.”  The book value of the bond is 
equal to the remaining promised payments (principal and coupon payments) discounted at the 
market rate of interest at issuance. 
(cid:121)  Coupon Payment: Cash Interest Payment = Par Value x Coupon Rate 
(cid:121)  Interest Expense: Interest Expense = book value of bond x Market Interest Rate at issuance 
(cid:121)  Zero-Coupon Bond: Bond with Coupon Rate of 0%
