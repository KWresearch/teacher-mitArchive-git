OVERVIEW OF ACCOUNTING FOR LONG LIVED ASSETS 
 
THE MATCHING PRINCIPLE IN ACTION 
 

(1)  What dollar amount to capitalize? 
(2)  Over what time period should the asset be expensed, i.e. depreciated? 
(3)  At what rate should the asset be expensed? 

 
PP&E EQUATIONS 
Hint: Copy these on your cheat sheet! See also the table method in E9-16 below. 
 

(1)  PPEEB = PPEBB + Acquisitions – Disposals 
(2)  AccDepEB = AccDepBB + Depreciation – AccDepDisposal 
(3)  Proceeds from Sale = BV1 + gain/loss 

                              
1 BV = Book Value
