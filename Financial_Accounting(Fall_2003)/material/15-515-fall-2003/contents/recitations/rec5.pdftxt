Statement of Cash Flows 

SCF – CHECKLIST (HINT: WRITE ON YOUR CHEAT SHEET!) 
• 	 Two types of cash flow statements – Direct & Indirect 
• 	 3 sections – operating, investing, financing 
• 	 Indirect statement of cash flow starts with Net Income 
• 	 Only operating section of the cash flow statements differs between direct and indirect 
statements 
• 	 Important transactions that neither increase nor decrease Cash are excluded from the face 
of the statement, e.g., purchase of land in exchange for a long-term note payable, 
declaration of dividends 
• 	 Remember to: 
• 	 Add back depreciation & amortization in Operating Section of indirect cash flow

statement

• 	 Add (subtract) losses (gains) from Operating Section of indirect cash flow statement
