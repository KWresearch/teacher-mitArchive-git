REVENUE RECOGNITION 
Revenue is recognized when the firm has: 
¶  Performed all, or a substantial portion of, the services to be provided 
¶  Incurred a substantial majority of the costs, and the remaining costs can be estimated 
¶  Received either cash, a receivable, or some other asset for which 
A reasonable precise value can be measured 
• 
•  Collectibility can be assured

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE 
¶  Two methods for determining Allowance for Bad Debts 
Percentage of (Credit) Sales 
• 
−  Fixes the Bad Debt Expense recorded for the year 
Aging Method 
−  Fixes the Ending Balance of Allowance for Bad Debts 
−  Bad Debt Expense is as a “Plug-in” 
¶  Relevant Formulae vs. “tables” (Don’t use them blindly!!) 
A/REB = A/RBB + Credit Sales – Cash Received – Write-off + Recovery 
• 
ADAEB = ADABB + Bad Debt Expense – Write-off + Recovery 
• 
¶  Write-offs and Recovery of bad debt only affects the Balance Sheet (not the Income 
Statement). They affect the Gross A/R and ADA but not the Net A/R. 
¶  Watch the sign convention for ADA!

INVENTORY (LIFO VS. FIFO) 
¶  LIFO and FIFO produce temporary differences in accounting numbers   
¶  No approach is superior 
¶  Firms using LIFO will give information to make numbers comparable across firms1 
¶  Relevant formulae 
LIFO Reserve = cumulative difference in FIFO – LIFO inventory 
• 
LIFO Reserve = Ending InvFIFO – Ending InvLIFO 
• 
Change in LIFO Reserve = COGSLIFO – COGSFIFO 
• 
INVEB = INVBB + P2 – COGS 
• 
¶  Make sure you know when to use the absolute amount in the LIFO Reserve and when to use 
changes in the LIFO Reserve

 PP&E 
¶  Key formulae vs. “table” 
PPEEB = PPEBB + Acquisitions – Disposals 
• 
AccDepEB = AccDepBB + Depreciation – AccDepDisposal 
• 
MV / Proceeds from sales = BV + gain/loss 
• 
¶  Three key ways to depreciate a fixed asset: 
1)  Straight-line Depreciation Method 
2)  Production (Depletion) Method 
3)  Accelerated Depreciation 
¶  Four simple steps to depreciation: 
1)  Assess total cost to be allocated over time 
2)  Estimate the salvage value (all methods except for double-declining balance) 
3)  Estimate useful life 
4)  Choose depreciation method 
¶  Watch the sign convention for Accumulated Depreciation!

 STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS 
Two major approaches to Statement of Cash Flows: Direct and Indirect 
¶  The major difference between these two methods is in how Cash Flows from Operating 
Activities are presented; most companies use the Indirect approach. 
Direct Approach: 
• 
− Analyze operating cash transactions and classify them as either cash sales or cash 
expenses (i.e., look down the “Cash” column of the BSE) 
Indirect Approach: 
−  Start with net income derived from accrual-based accounting 
−  Decrease net income for operating income(s) that did not generate cash (i.e. A/R) 
−  Increase the net income for operating expenses that did not use up cash (e.g., 
depreciation and amortization) 
−  Adjust the net income for operating cash items that were not expensed 
¶  The investing and financing sections are the same for both Direct SCF and Indirect SCF
