***** Graded Assignments *****
Your solutions to these graded questions must be submitted by the date
specified below. Assignments 1-6 are to be completed individually. Assignments
7-9 involve case analysis and are to be done in half-groups.
***** Optional Questions *****
The optional questions are end-of-chapter problems that were chosen to provide
particular reinforcement of the class topic. They are all from the course
textbook, Pratt J., Financial Accounting in an Economic Context, 5th ed. John
Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.
These optional problems generally deal with record keeping and reporting and
computations. They are designed to reinforce concepts learned through reading
assignments, homework problems, case discussions, and T.A. sessions.
