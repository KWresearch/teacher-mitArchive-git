***** Objectives *****
This section of the session road map below specifies the learning objectives
you should achieve through (a) the assigned readings and homework, (b) the
class discussion or lecture, or (c) the weekly T.A. session (if needed).
Periodically, it also summarizes key concepts. You and your group can gauge
your progress by assessing the extent to which you have met these objectives
and understand the concepts.<
***** Class Preparation Questions *****
As these problems are related to the class discussion and often will be used as
the basis of class discussion, they should receive your utmost attention. You
may find it valuable to discuss these with your group members before class.
Some questions refer to the Intel 2002 Annual Report, which is available for
download from the Intel Web site. (PDF)#

                                           a. On 1/1/90, CC sells a stereo for
                                           $1,000 cash. Cost of inventory is
                                           $900. Customer also pays $100 cash
                                           for 2-year warranty coverage, which
                                           CC expects to require $20 in parts

                                           need to estimate the dollar impact
                                           of this change?
