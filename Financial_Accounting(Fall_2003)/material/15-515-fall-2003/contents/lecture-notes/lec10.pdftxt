GAAP  vs.  Tax Code


Examples of differences:


Revenue Recognition:  rental fees collected in advance 
 GAAP : Rent revenue recognized when earned (passage of time) 
 Tax Code:  Rent collections considered as taxable income 

Matching principle:  depreciation of fixed assets 
 GAAP:  Different depreciation methods allowed, e.g. straight line 
 Tax Code:  MACRS  (accelerated);  no residual value 

Other items:  Revenue from municipal bonds 
 GAAP:  Revenue recognized as interest is earned (passage of time) 
 Tax Code:  Interest revenue exempt from federal taxes 

What factors cause differences in accounting rules for GAAP and the Tax Code?

Two Methods of Accounting for Timing Differences 


Japan, Germany:  ??? = part of income tax expense 
 Essentially, GAAP = Tax Code 
 Tax expense = taxes currently owed, thus deferred taxes do not arise 

United States:  ??? = recognize as "deferred tax liability" 

 Tax expense is based on the pre-tax GAAP income.  

 Deferred taxes arise because tax expense ≠ taxes currently owed


Income tax expense  =  Current tax expense   +  Deferred tax expense 
(Deferred Tax Liability) 
(Taxes payable)  
(NI) 

Deferred tax expense = Timing difference x statutory tax rate 
= Deferred Tax Liability

Deferred Taxes over Time 


Deferred taxes caused by timing differences are temporary, because they reverse over time.

Deferred Tax Liability: Summary 


Deferred tax liabilities arise/increase when a timing difference leads to:  

(GAAP) 
(IRS) 
Current  Taxable income  <  Pretax Income 

!  GAAP recognizes more revenue than the Tax Code 
#  Revenue recognition before cash collection (e.g., unremitted earnings of 
foreign subsidiaries) 

!  GAAP matches less expenses than the Tax Code 
#  Expenses matched in the Tax Code are  accelerated relative to GAAP 
(e.g., MACRS vs. straight line) 

Deferred tax liabilities decrease (to zero) when the above events reverse 
in the future.

Deferred Tax Asset: Illustration


Suppose that total rent collected in 2003 was $100,000, of which 
$50,000 was  rent paid in advance for 2004.  Tax rate is 30%.

A deferred tax asset of $15,000 was created in 2003.  The reversal 

occurs in 2004 when the (financial) revenue for 2004 is recognized.

Tax Effects of Marketable Securities


Suppose the value of stock you own goes up by $100. 
Are you $100 richer? 

In the U.S., capital gains and losses are not recognized for tax purposes 
unless realized.  We will soon see that unrealized gains and losses from 
certain securities are recognized in the financial statements. 

These unrealized gains and losses carry with them an obligation to pay 
more or less in future taxes, i.e. deferred liabilities or assets.

Permanent Differences: Summary 


!	 Permanent differences are never expected to reverse (e.g., income that is never 
taxable) 
!  Permanent differences do not create deferred taxes. However, they do change 
the effective tax rate, because the basis of income tax expense is adjusted for 
permanent differences. 
P  Tax-exempt revenues (e.g. interest income from state and local bonds)
decreases the effective tax rate 
P  Non-tax deductible expenses (e.g. government fines) increases the 
effective tax rate 
Income tax expense =(Pretax income -Tax-exempt revenues
 + Nondeductible  expense) x statutory tax rate 

Effective tax rate = Income tax expense / Pretax GAAP income

Tax Deductions from Net Operating Losses (NOL)


!	 Net operating loss carryback: generates a refund of income taxes paid from 
two years back, in the order of years, starting with the earliest year.

!	 Net operating loss carryforward: reduces taxable income in subsequent 
years, up to a maximum of 20 years. Leftover NOL carryback may be carried 
forward, but once an NOL is carried forward, it can no longer be carried back.

  NOL carryforwards are recorded as deferred tax assets.

Valuation Allowance


If the benefits of a deferred tax asset are not likely to be realized, the value 
of the deferred tax asset balance  should be reduced by a "valuation account". 

!	 Conservatism:  no symmetric adjustment for deferred tax liabilities, except

when future tax rates decrease

!	 Application of judgement: "likely" means more than 50% probability of

occuring.

!	 Bad signal: implies that management believes not enough earnings in the

future

!	 Valuation allowance increases the effective tax rate when recognized (because

it increases income tax expense).

Changes in Tax Rates 


When tax rates change, deferred tax assets and liabilities are readjusted 

to reflect the taxes that will be incurred when the reversals occur (proper  

matching). 

!  The new tax rate is used for timing differences as soon as the law instituting 
the tax change is enacted, even if the law is not yet officially in force. 
!	 Adjustments to previous balances are disclosed as additions or reductions in

the deferred tax component of income tax expense.

!	 Changes in tax rates affect the effective tax rates from the year new tax ra tes 

are enacted until the new tax rates are in effect.

Income tax expense = Current tax expense + Deferred tax expense  +  DTA/L adj. 
 (future-current) 
(future rate)
(current rate) 

In 1993, Congress increased the federal tax rate for corporations, from 34% to 35%. 
Ford reported a decrease in income taxes of $199 million in 1993 due to the rate 
adjustment.  Why did the tax rate inc rease boost Ford’s income? 
(Answer:  Ford had a deferred tax asset.)
