Why do we care about revenue recognition?


We want to understand how Net Income is computed so we can interpret 
this performance measure.  Revenue is obviously a big part of Net Income 

Statistical Evidence: over 40% of SEC enforcement actions on accounting 
issues deal with Revenue Recognition 

Anecdotal Evidence:  Recent experience of Bristol-Myers 
•	 "In another setback for the beleaguered drug maker, Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Co. confirmed that the Securities and Exchange Commission has 
opened an inquiry into whether it improperly inflated revenue last year 
by as much as $1 billion through use of sales incentives... Drug makers, 
like many other manufacturers, can boost near-term sales by extending 
lower prices to wholesalers, encouraging them to load up. But such 
"channel-stuffing" hurts later sales." (The Wall Street Journal, 7/12/2002)

Criteria for Revenue Recognition 


Under accrual accounting, a firm recognizes revenue 
when it has: 

1)  Performed all, or a substantial portion of, the 
services to be provided. 

2)  Incurred a substantial majority of the costs, and the 
remaining costs can be reasonably estimated. 

3)  Received either cash, a receivable, or some other 
asset for which 
• 
a reasonably precise value can be measured  

collectibility is reasonably assured.

Allowance for Returns


If customer has the right to return the product, the seller must

estimate the dollar value of returns.

Revenue is reported net of the amount expected to be returned. 

Typically, seller sets up a contra-asset account, Allowance for 

Returns: 

•	 Analogous to Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
•	 When return actually occurs, reduce both Allowance and face 
value of Accounts Receivable (or Cash) by the invoice amount. 
•	 Return has no effect on Net Income, nor on Net Assets, just as 
Write-off of Uncollectible has no effect on these amounts. 
•	 BSE:   AR - Allowance for Returns = RE 
Intel takes a slightly different approach: Deferred Income 
Liability.

Reverse Engineering:  How much Cash did 

Intel Collect from Customers in 2002?

Reverse Engineering process: 
Identify Relevant Balance Sheet Accounts:  A/R, 
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Deferred Income 
Identify the activities that affect these accounts: 
•	 Recognizing sales revenue as A/R  

•	 Recognizing bad debt expense 
•	 Writing off uncollectible accounts  

•	 Invoicing products that affect the Deferred Income 

Liability 

Obtain amounts from the Financial Statements, notes, other  

•  i.e., Intel’s Bad Debt Expense ($10M) and Write-offs  

($21) are disclosed in its 10-K report filed with the 

SEC, but not in the annual report.

Set up BSE template and “plug” the remaining numbers

Summary Points


Criteria for recognizing revenue (Earned and Collectible) 
Collectibility: Match expected bad debts to the period in which 
the sales occur

- Distinguish between Bad Debt Expense and Write-Offs 
- Methods for estimating Bad Debts / Uncollectible Accounts 
Right of Return: match expected returns to the sales period, or 
more conservatively, defer revenue recognition until return 
protection / price protection ends 
Reverse Engineering: infer the activities that underlie a firm’s 
reported financial results
