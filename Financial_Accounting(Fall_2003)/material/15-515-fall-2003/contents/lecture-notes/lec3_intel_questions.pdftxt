Compute Intel's Profit Margin (Net Income / Sales) for 2000-2002. What is the trend? 
Compute Intel’s Return on Equity for 2002.  How does it compare to other firms in 
Intel’s industry?

industry? 
Compute the ratio of Intel’s stock price to its owner's equity-per-share outstanding.  This 
is the “market-to-book” ratio.  Why are “market” and “book” different?  How would this 
ratio compare to market-to-book ratio of the average firm in the steel industry?

total assets is  represented by cash and marketable securities? (Relevant B/S accounts: 
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Short-term Investments, Trading Assets, Long-term 
Investments)  
Compute Intel's Gross Margin Ratio [(Sales - Cost of Sales) / Sales] for the years 2000-
2002. Comment on the trend. What economic and strategic factors might contribute to 
changes in this ratio over time?  What types of companies would tend to have a high 
gross margin ratio? 
Has Intel paid dividends over the past three years? How much? Why would Intel hold so 
much cash rather than, say, paying out higher dividends to its shareholders?  
Compute Intel's Long-Term-Debt-to-Equity Ratio for 2001-2002. What benchmarks 
might you use to judge whether a firm's D/E ratio is high or low?  
How much cash has Intel spent each of the last 3 years for Property, Plant, and 
Equipment? How quickly does Intel depreciate PP&E? (See the ' Accounting Policies 
note.) How does depreciating PP&E affect Intel's Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and
