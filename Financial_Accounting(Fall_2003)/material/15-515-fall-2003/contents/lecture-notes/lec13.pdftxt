Bonds – Terminology


Par value - stated or face value of the bond; the amount due at maturity 
Market value - the value assigned to the bond by investors 

Three interest rates are relevant to bond accounting: 
1)  Coupon rate - the rate used to determine the periodic cash payments (if 
any) 

2)  (Current) Market interest rate - the rate used to determine the current 
market value of the bond.  The market rate is based upon market 
conditions and the risk characteristics of the borrower 

3)  Effective interest rate - the  market rate at issuance, used to determine 
the interest expense and the book value of the liability

Bonds – An Introduction 


If at issuance the market rate = coupon rate then market value = par 
value.  The bond is said to sell at par (also, face value). When a bond 
sells at par its coupon payment is equal to its interest expense. 

While we will primarily focus on bonds sold at par, there are two 
other possibilities: 

If at issuance the market rate is greater than the coupon rate then the 
market value is less than par value.  The difference between market 
value and par value is called the discount on the bond and its coupon 
payment is less than its interest expense.  An extreme case of this is 
the zero-coupon bond. 

If at issuance the market rate is less than the coupon rate then the 
market value is greater than the par value.  The difference between 
market value and par value is called the premium on the bond and its 
coupon payment is more than its interest expense.

Bonds


Consider a loan with proceeds of $10,000 initiated on 1/1/99.  The 
market interest rate is 6% and final payment is to be made at the end 
of the third year (12/31/01).  What annual payments are required under 
the following three alternatives? 

I.  Yearly payments of interest at the end of each year and repayment 
of principal at the end of the third year (typical bond terms). 

II. Three equal payments at the end of each year (mortgage / new car 
loan terms). 

III. A single payment of principal and interest at the end of year 3 
(Zero-Coupon bond).

Summary


•	 Long-term liabilities such as bonds are reported at PV

•	 Discount rate for PV calculation 
= market rate at time of issuance (= effective int. rate) 
•	 Debt characteristics vary widely – we looked at 3 types.

Interest payments ≠ interest expense if coupon rate ≠ 
•	
effective interest rate 
•	 Market value may substantially differ from reported 
book value of debt if market rate changes significantly 
after issuance.
