Example to Illustrate Net Operating Tax-loss Carryforwards,  Changes in Future Tax Rates, 
and the Valuation Allowance. 

 
Please assume the following: 
a)  EFP Company has a ($100,000) pretax loss in 2000 
b)  EFP Company had $75,000 of pretax income in 1999 
c)  EFP Company began operations in 1999 
d)  The corporate tax rate is 30% 

 
These assumptions imply that EFP paid $22,500 in taxes (0.3*$75,000) in 1999.

Simple NOL application  The entries related to taxes in fiscal 2000 using a BSE format  
and the “pretax loss,” “tax benefit,” and “net loss” lines of the income statement are shown 
below. 

 

Future Tax Rate Change Assume that before the close of fiscal 2000, Congress increases 
tax rates for fiscal years beginning in 2001 and beyond to 35%.  The BSE entry to adjust 
taxes for this event is 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 

Valuation Allowance Assume instead that at the end of fiscal 2000 EFP estimates it will 
generate only $20,000 of income before the NOL carryforward expires.  The BSE entry to 
adjust taxes for this event is
