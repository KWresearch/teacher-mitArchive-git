The Nature of Leases


A lease is an agreement conveying the right to use property, plant, or 
equipment usually for a stated period of time. 

The owner of the property is referred to as the lessor, and the renter is the 
lessee. 

Two basic questions related to leasing: 
1) What is the economic rationale for leasing rather than purchasing an 
asset? (Finance/Economic question) 
2) Should a given arrangement be treated as a rental or purchase for 
financial reporting purposes? (Accounting question)

Finance/Economic Question 

Advantages to Leasing 
Operational advantages to the lessee: 
Leasing ready-to-use equipment may be more attractive if the 
asset requires lengthy preparation and set-up. 
Leasing avoids having to own the asset that will be required 
only seasonally, temporarily or sporadically. 
Leasing for short periods provides protection against 
obsolescence. 

Financial advantages to the lessee: 

Lease payments can be tailored to suit the lessee's cash flows 
(up to 100% financing, instead of the 80% limit by banks). 
Properly structured leases may be “off-balance sheet”, avoiding 
Restrictions set by bondholders that prevent firm from taking on 
additional debt. 
Leasing provides tax advantages from accelerated depreciation 
and interest expense.

Finance/Economic Question 

Disadvantages to Leasing


Disadvantages to the lessee: 
Leased ready-to-use equipment may be of lower quality than custom 
built, resulting in lower quality products and lower sales. 
Seasonal leasing may affect equipment availability and pricing. 
Premium must be paid for the protection against obsolescence. 

Disadvantages to financial statement users: 
Off-balance sheet financing hides the true leverage of the firm.

Accounting Question

What is the Economic Substance of the Arrangement? 

Possible arrangements between lessor and lessee


Rent 
Own

________________________________________________ 

Treat these as a rental? 

Treat these as a purchase? 


· Operating lease – (rental) lessee rents the property.  Lessee accrues rent 
expense. 

· Capital lease  - (purchase) lessee essentially owns the property.  Lessee 
records the leased asset in the balance sheet (i.e. capitalized) together 
with the corresponding lease obligation. 

Where do we draw the line between rental and purchase accounting

treatment?

Accounting Criteria for Lease Capitalization


In theory, a lease should be capitalized if the risks and rewards of 
ownership are transferred from the lessor to the lessee.  In practice, 
a lease is considered a capital lease if ANY of the following 
conditions apply (from SFAS 13): 

1.  Essential transfer of ownership at the end of lease term

• No payment for leased asset, or 
• Bargain purchase option (BPO) - payment below market value 
after the lease term. 

2. Minimum present value of lease payments (including BPO, if 
any) at least 90% of asset's market value 

3. Lease term is 75% of assets remaining useful life

Accounting for capital leases--Lessee’s Books


A capital lease is recorded as an acquisition of an asset with 100% debt 
financing in the financial statements. 

When the lease agreement is signed and lessee begins using the asset: 

Lease Obligation 
Leased Property 
PVL 
PVL 

During the lease (as payments are made) 
Cash

(PP) 
(PP - Int)             
(Int) 
(int. exp.) 
(dep. exp.) 
(Depr) 
Depr 
PVL = present value of periodic lease payments = (PV of ordinary annuity, n payments, r %) * PP

PP = periodic lease payment

Int = Beginning lease liability * r%, 

Beginning lease liability = present value of remaining payments at r% 

Depr = depreciation expense

Financial statement disclosures -- Target


Based on information in the lease footnote, what value does Target show 
for lease liability on its Balance sheet? 

The footnote says Target’s borrowing rate is 8.8 percent.  Could this 
amount be independently computed?
