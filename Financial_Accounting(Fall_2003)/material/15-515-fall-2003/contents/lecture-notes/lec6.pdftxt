Accounting for Inventory


Objectives 

Understand 
• Cost-flow assumptions are necessary to determine

ending inventory and cost of goods sold (COGS)

• LIFO and FIFO are two cost-flow assumptions  

• How the COGS and ending inventory numbers differ 

under LIFO and FIFO?

• How to convert LIFO COGS and ending inventory to 
FIFO COGS and ending inventory (understand the LIFO 
reserve) 
• How inventory assumptions affect taxes

Accounting for Inventory


Inventory accounting has two fundamental components: 

1) Product Costing Decision (This component is discussed in 
managerial accounting) 

What costs flow into each product's inventory account? 

2) Cost Flow & Valuation Decisions 

Once costs are in the inventory account (i.e., on the Balance 
sheet), when are costs transferred to the Income Statement?

Accounting for Inventory


EInvFIFO  = BInvFIFO  + Inputs - COGSFIFO 

EInv
LIFO  = BInvLIFO  + Inputs - COGSLIFO 

The amount of input does not depend upon the choice of LIFO/FIFO. 

EInv

FIFO  - EInvLIFO  = BInvFIFO  - BInvLIFO 
+ COGSLIFO  - COGSFIFO 

Change in LIFO Reserve = COGSLIFO-COGSFIFO 

The change in LIFO Reserve tells us the difference in cost between LIFO and FIFO.

Accounting for Inventory


Suppose no inventory is acquired at start of year 2 (sales = 4) 

• FIFO COGS = 4 x $8   = $32  (as before) 
• LIFO COGS = 4 x $8   = $32  (same) 

Liquidating LIFO layers, if multiple layers exist 
• Decrease LIFO COGS (possibly less than FIFO) 
• Increase profitability 
• Decrease LIFO reserve 
• Decrease turnover ratio 

Earnings manipulation?

Accounting for inventory: Tax considerations 


LIFO conformity rule: if a firm uses LIFO for tax purposes, it 
must also use LIFO for financial reporting purposes 

Choice should minimize the present value of tax payments


Given the tax effects, what types of firms would you expect 
to choose each inventory method?

Summary


•Matching principle requires a “cost flow” assumption, 
leading to different accounting methods (e.g. LIFO/FIFO) 

• Computation/record-keeping trivial, but implications not: 
LIFO and FIFO produce temporary differences in accounting 
numbers. 

• No accounting method is innately superior: choice depends 
upon business environment, incentives of users, possibility of 
manipulation, etc. 

• Disclosures available to make numbers comparable across 
firms.
