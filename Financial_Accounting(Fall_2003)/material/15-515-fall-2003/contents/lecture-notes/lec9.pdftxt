Statement of Cash Flows


Balance sheet equation: 
A(t) = L(t) + E(t) 
Decompose: 
∆Cash + ∆CA + ∆NCA = ∆CL + ∆NCL + ∆CC + ∆OE + ∆RE 

Differences:

∆A = ∆L + ∆E 

=> 

Note that ∆RE = NI - Div, thus after rearranging,

∆Cash = NI - ∆CA + ∆CL - ∆NCA + ∆NCL + ∆OE + ∆CC -Div


Accounts we know: 
∆Cash = NI  - ∆netAR - ∆Inventory - ∆OCA + ∆CL -∆netPPE 
- ∆ONCA  + ∆NCL + ∆OE + ∆CC - Div

Statement of Cash Flows


∆Cash = ∆Cashoperations  + ∆Cashinvesting  + ∆Cashfinancing 

∆Cashoperations  = NI + DepExp - ∆netAR - ∆Inventory  -∆OCA 
+ ∆CL  - Gain(Loss) 

∆Cashinvesting  = -∆netPPE + Gain(Loss) -DepExp -∆ONCA+∆OE 
= - Acquisitions + Disposals - ∆ONCA+∆OE 

∆Cashfinancing  = + ∆NCL + ∆CC - Div

Rules of Significant Noncash Transactions


Some transactions are omitted from the SCF but disclosed 
elsewhere (such as at the bottom of the SCF) so long as they are 
material:

lease obligations) or by issuing equity securities 
• Exchanges of non-monetary assets 
• Refinancing of long-term debt 
• Conversion of debt or preferred stock to common stock
