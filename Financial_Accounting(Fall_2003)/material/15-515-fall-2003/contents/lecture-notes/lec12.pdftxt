Accounting Guidelines on Contingencies


The accounting treatment of a contingency depends on

(1) whether the contingency is:
Probable - the future event is likely to occur 
Reasonably possible - the chance of occurrence of the future event 
(or events) is more than remote but less than likely 
Remote - the chance of occurrence of the future event (or events) is 
slight 

(2) whether the amount of the gain or loss must be reasonably estimated.

Present Value Concepts 


Annuities 
Ordinary Annuity (annuity in arrears) - payments occur at the end of the 
period 
Annuity due (annuity in advance) - payments occur at the beginning of the 
period

What is the PV of a 3 year $100 ordinary annuity at 8%?

|---------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|


A General Formula: 
PV(a) = {[1 - (1+r)^(-N)]*[1/r]}* Fixed Period Cash Flow 

Note: A perpetuity is an annuity that goes on forever.  As N approaches 
infinity, the formula for PV(a) becomes [1/r]*Fixed Period Cash Flow.  If 
you were to receive $100 a year forever, the PV of that stream of 
payments, given r = 8%, is 100/.08 = 1,250. If you were to receive $100 a 
year for 50 years, the PV of that stream of payments, given r = 8%, is  
1,223.35.  Why is the difference so small?
