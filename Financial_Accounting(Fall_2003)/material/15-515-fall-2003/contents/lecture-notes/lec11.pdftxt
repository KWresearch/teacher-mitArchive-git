Marketable Securities and Valuation 

Adjustments 


Objectives 
Understand when accounting departs from the "transactions (cid:173)

Illustrate the role of judgment in applying the lower-of-cost-or-
market (LCM) rule for inventory 

Understand how marketable securities are valued on companies' 
Balance Sheets 

Understand the Income Statement effects of valuation 
adjustments

Should Changes in Market Value be  

Recognized?


Accounts receivable 
• Estimates of uncollectibles 
• Changes in credit risk 

Inventory 
• Purchase/production cost 
• Changes in input prices, obsolescence 

Fixed Assets 
• Acquisition cost (historical basis) 
• Obsolescence 

Reliability vs.  Relevance

Lower of Cost of Market Rule for Inventory


When Market Value of Inventory  <  Capitalized Cost

• Loss on inventory write-down = Capitalized cost - Market 

Value, added to Cost of Goods Sold  

• Market value = minimum of replacement cost and selling price

• Once inventory written down in the balance sheet, it cannot be 
“written up” in subsequent periods 

Issues 
• Susceptibility to write-downs of LIFO vs. FIFO

• “Hidden reserves” and income smoothing

What are Marketable Securities?


Marketable securities 
•  Corporate and government bonds, treasuries

•  Common stock 
•  Derivative instruments: options, swaps, etc.


Accounting Questions 
(Q1) Should changes in market value of Marketable Securities 
be recorded on the B/S? 

If the answer to (Q1) is yes,


(Q2) Should changes in market value be recognized on the 
income statement?

Statement of Financial Accounting Standard  

(SFAS) 115

SFAS 115 requires the firm to classify its securities into 3 categories  


• Held-to-maturity (debt only) - acquired with ability and intent 
to hold to maturity 
•Trading securities (debt and equity) - Acquired for short-term 
profit potential 
• Available for sale (debt and equity) - Securities not classified 
as either of above

Statement of Financial Accounting Standard  

(SFAS) 115

Accounting treatment varies according to category

(of unrealized gains and losses) 

• Held-to-maturity (debt only) 
• Trading securities (debt and equity) 
• Available for sale (debt and equity) 

B/S 
Effect 
(Q1) no 
(Q1) yes 
(Q1) yes 

I/S 
Effect 

(Q2) yes 
(Q2) no 

Therefore changes in market value affect the balance sheet for 
available for sale and trading securities.  Changes in market value 
affect the income statement only for trading securities.

Reclassifications of Marketable Securities


Trading to Available for sale 
• Gains or losses of the period recognized on reclassification date

• Subsequent market value changes reported in “Other Equity” 

Available for sale to Trading 
• Cumulative gains or losses, including those of current period, 
recognized on reclassification date 
• Subsequent market value changes reported in the income 
statement 

15.515 2003 
Session 11 

Why does Recognition of Gains/Loss Matter?


Former SEC Chairman Breeden, on mark-to-market (ca 1990): If you are in a 
volatile business, then your balance sheet and income statement should reflect 
that volatility. Furthermore, we have seen significant abuse of managed earnings. 
Too often companies buy securities with an intent to hold them as investments, 
and then miraculously, when they rise in value, the companies decide it's time to 
sell them. Meanwhile, their desire to hold those securities that are falling in value 
grows ever stronger. So companies report the gains and hide the losses. 

Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, Jr (1997): it is unacceptable to allow 
American investors to remain in the dark about the consequences of a $23 trillion 
derivatives exposure.  We support the independence of the FASB as they turn on 
the light. 

Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan, on derivatives (ca 1997): Putting the 
unrealized gains and losses of open derivatives contracts onto companies’ income 
statements would introduce "artificial" volatility to their earnings and equity.  
Shareholders would become confused; management might forego sensible 
hedging strategies out of purely window dressing concerns. 

15.515 2003 
Session 11 

A Compromise (and ‘Comprised’ GAAP?)


Recognize all unrealized gains/losses for “trading securities” in 
Net Income 

Mark “available for sale” securities to market value, but don’t 
report changes in the income statement.  This reduces the 
“volatility” of the income statement.  (Managers do not like 
volatility and have similarily complained about the volatility 
derivatives accounting could have -but that’s another issue) 

Ignore value changes for “held to maturity” category

SFAS 130 (June 1997):  Introduces Comprehensive Income


Addressed concerns many had of items bypassing the income 
statement. 

Unrealized gains/losses of AFS securities are recorded directly to 
shareholders' equity as a component of "Other Comprehensive 
Income." 
• Do NOT include as part of net income.  (do not pass GO; do not 
accrue $200)

Marketable Securities in Other Countries


Canada: LCM for investments classified as current assets; 
historical cost for noncurrent assets, but recognize “permanent” 
declines in value 

Mexico: Carry marketable securities at net realizable value, report 
gains/losses in the income statement; LCM for other investments 

Japan: LCM for marketable securities 

Others: Typically either LCM or mark-to-market, exclusively

Summary:  Marketable Securities and Valuation Adjustments 


Valuation adjustment necessary when changes in market values 
are objectively measurable 

Lower of cost or market applied to inventory valuation 

Mark-to-market accounting for marketable securities


Disclosure vs. Recognition in mark-to-market accounting: 
• Not all gains and losses are reported in the income statement

• Unrealized gains and losses are part of comprehensive income


A compromise GAAP: a “compromised” GAAP, too?
