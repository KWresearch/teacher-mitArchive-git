Note on Cash Flow Statements 

Indirect Cash Flow Statements can be pretty confusing, but they don't have to be if you think about their 
relationship to the other financial statements. Here I present several examples to help you to intuitively 
think about how you can use the income statement and the balance sheet to determine the statement of cash 
flows using the indirect method. After looking at these examples, you can construct even more complicated 
ones for yourself to strengthen your intuition. 

There is a mathematical method for thinking about the indirect method. Here I will repeat the derivation 
that you saw in class. You should also have this information in 
•	
the note entitled "Understanding the Statement of Cash Flow" in the course packet, and 
•	
the class slides "The Statement of Cash Flow." 

Balance Sheet Equation: 
A(t) = L(t) + SE(t) 
A(t+1) = L(t+1) + SE(t+1) 

Differences: 
DA = DL + DSE 

Beginning Balance Sheet Equation (at time t) 
Ending Balance Sheet Equation (at time t+1 period) 

Decompose: 
DCash + DOCA + DNCA = DCL + DNCL + DCC + DOE + DRE


Note that DRE = NI - Div so we have:

DCash + DOCA + DNCA = DCL + DNCL + DCC + DOE + NI - Div


Since we are interested in the change in cash, we re-arrange to solve for the change in cash: 
DCash	 = - DOCA - DNCA + DCL + DNCL + DCC + DOE + NI - Div 
= + NI - DOCA + DCL - DNCA + DNCL + DCC + DOE - Div 

Putting in the accounts we know about: 
DCash	 = + NI - DnetA/R - DInv. - DOCA + DCL - DnetPPE - DNCA + DNCL + DCC + DOE - Div 

But the change in net PP&E can be broken down even further into B/S and I/S effects: 
DnetPPE 	 = DPPE - DAccDepreciation 
= Gain(Loss) - DepExp + (DPPE - DAccDepreciation) -Gain(Loss) + DepExp 
Since Gains(Losses) should not affect the Operating Section, but are included in the 
IncomeStatement, they need to be subtracted(added) from Net Income in this section. 
Since Depreciation Expense is a non-cash expense (but affects Net Income), it needs to be 
added back to the Net Income in the Operating Section.

Inserting the expanded DnetPPE: 
DCash  = + NI - DnetA/R - DInv. - DOCA + DCL - (Gain(Loss) - DepExp + (DPPE – 
DAccDepreciation) -Gain(Loss) + DepExp) - DNCA + DNCL + DCC + DOE - Div 

Rearranging: 
DCash	 =  + NI + DepExp - DnetA/R - DInv. - DOCA + DCL - Gain(Loss) 
- (DPPE - DAccDepreciation) +Gain(Loss) - DepExp - DNCA + DOE 
+ DNCL + DCC - Div

DPPE =Acquisition – Disposal at Original Cost 

DAccDepreciation = DepExp – AccDepreciation of Disposed Item


Thus: 

DPPE - DAccDepreciation -Gain(Loss) + DepExp = Acquisition – (Disposal at Original 
Cost - AccDepreciation of Disposed Item) - Gain(Loss) 
= Acquisition – Proceeds from Disposal
