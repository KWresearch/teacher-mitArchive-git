Accounting for Long-lived Assets

Objectives
Understand more applications of the matching principle, 
specifically, the allocation of historical costs to future 
revenues

Recognize the common aspects of the record keeping & 
reporting challenge that are shared by many balance sheet 
items related to these decisions.

Continue to learn how to reverse engineer related accounting 
entries from financial statement information.

Begin to understand and appreciate the Statement of Cash 
Flows.

To account for a fixed asset one must answer 
the following four questions

(1) What is the acquisition cost?

(2) How much is the salvage value?

(3) What is the expected useful service life?

(4) What pattern of depreciation should be used to allocate 
expense over the useful life?

Determining Acquisition Costs

What is given up to obtain the asset?

• Purchased Assets: Purchase price plus cost to prepare the 
asset for use (installation, transport)
- Case 1:  Cash
- Case 2:  Financing (down payment plus loan/note)
- Case 3:  Other assets (Cash plus trade-in)

• Self-Constructed Assets
- Direct costs of construction
- Financing costs (interest on funds borrowed to 
finance construction)

Determining useful life: what factors affect this estimate?

disposal)

Economic vs. Accounting Depreciation

Blockbuster Video:

What is the life of a video cassette?

What is its salvage value?

What allocation method best matches the expense to the use 
of the resource?

GAAP Depreciation Methods

Production (Use) Method
• Depreciation cost per machine hour 
depreciable basis/service life (in machine-hours)
• Depreciation Expense = Actual hours used * hourly rate

Straight-line Depreciation
• Annual Depreciation Expense 
depreciable basis/service life (in years)
• Used by overwhelming majority of US firms

Accelerated Depreciation
• Mostly confined to tax reporting

Accounting for Long-lived Assets:  An Example

Example: Beginning of Year 1: Cost = $100K, Salvage Value = 0, 
initial UL estimate of 5 years.  After 2nd year, spend $30K on 
improvement that extends UL by 3 years (i.e., to total of 8).
Cash     +   PPE   - AccDep + OA  =      L     +    CC     +   RE

Yr 1:                                                           

Yr 2:                                                           

Yr 3:                                                           

Yr: 8

Gain or Loss on Disposal of Long-lived Assets

Example:  At end of 7th year, when BV is $15K, sell Asset from 
last example for scrap value of $2K.

Cash    +    PPE     -

AccDep

+  OA   =         L        +         E

Depreciation Bookkeeping

What financial statements are affected by depreciation?

What accounts are affected?

Does depreciation affect cash?

Session 7

Changes in Depreciation Assumptions

Caused by change in asset life or salvage value 

Apply the change prospectively, i.e., to future years (no 
restatement)

PP&E and the Indirect Statement of Cash Flows

Cash From (Used by) Investing Activities:  
• Cash Used to Purchase PP&E
• Cash Received (if any) from Disposing of PP&E

Cash From (Used by) Financing Activities: 
• What if PP&E is purchased using borrowed funds?

Cash From (Used by) Operating Activities:
• Most firms use Indirect Method, i.e., start with reported Net 
Income and remove non-cash effects
• What non-cash effects of PP&E bookkeeping are embedded in 
Net Income?

Tax and Timing 
Effects of Long-lived Assets

Tax Depreciation
• More accelerated
•No judgment

Tax Reporting  Financial Reporting ==> timing differences 
in the measurement of income
• Why would a firm prefer accelerated depreciation for tax 
purposes?
• Why does government allow this?
• Why not use tax methods for financial reporting?

This difference gives rise to Deferred Taxes - more on this 
later

Summary

Expenditures on fixed assets are capitalized: either as PPE 
or part of inventory; these expenditures are later “matched” 
to revenues produced by the fixed assets.

Depreciation does not involve cash.  Cash is involved only 
at acquisition and disposal.

Discretion is applied on making estimates of useful life, 
salvage value, and choice of depreciation method
