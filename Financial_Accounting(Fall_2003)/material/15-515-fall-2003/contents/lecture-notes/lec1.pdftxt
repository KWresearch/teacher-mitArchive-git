The Five Challenges


Record keeping and reporting 
•	 As a preparer, having determined the numbers you want to record 
for an economic event, how do you record them?  How does it affect 
accounting reports? 

•	 As a user, given the reported numbers, do I know how they were 

computed?


Computation 
•	 As a preparer, having chosen the accounting method to measure an 
event, how do I compute the number reported in 1? 

•	 As a user, knowing the procedures used by management, and the 

information necessary to execute them, how would you compute 

them yourself?
