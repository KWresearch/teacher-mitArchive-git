Investments and Acquisitions


¾	 Understand that the accounting method used for investments
depends on the extent to which the investor exerts influence
over the investee. 

¾	 Understand the effects of dividends received and investee 
income on the financial statements of the investor under the 
equity method. 

¾	 Understand the effects of consolidated accounting on the
balance sheet and income statement of the investor. 

  Does an acquisition affect shareholders’ equity?

  What do “minority interest” on the B/S and I/S mean?

  How is goodwill computed?

Investments in the Stock of Other Companies


¾	 The accounting method for stock investments depends on the 
degree of influence the investing company has on the 
decisions of the investee. 

¾	 Three methods of accounting for this investment:

20-50% 
<20% 
Ownership: 
“significant 
influence” 

Influence: 

“passive” 

>50% 

“controlling” 

Reporting 
Method:

Significant Influence Î Equity Method


¾	 Assume the following events

1.	 Purchase: Investor acquires 48,000 shares amounting to 40% of EE 
Corporation for $10 per share 
2.	 Dividends:  EE Corporation pays a dividend of $60,000 or 50 cents 
per share 
3.	 Affiliate earnings: EE Corporation Earns $100,000 in Net Income 

¾	 Record these events on BSE of investor company.

Control Î Consolidation Method


¾  When the investor controls the investee, 
  The investor corporation becomes a parent. 
  The investee corporation becomes a subsidiary. 
  The parent prepares consolidated financial statements that
treat the parent and the subsidiary as a single economic 
entity even though they are separate legal entities. 

¾  Consolidated financial reporting brings together
multiple sets of financial records 
  Each subsidiary maintains its own set of books that are
independent of who owns it 
  Parent prepares consolidation financial statements.

Consolidation:  <100% Purchase


¾  Suppose P Co. buys 80% of S Co.’s stock for $88 cash. 
(80% × $110) 

ÎMinority interests (economic concept) 
  Investors who own the remaining 20% of S Co. have a claim on the 
assets and earnings of S Co. 
  But P controls S, so P has access to all of S’s assets (not just 80%) 
  P’s consolidated reports shows 100% of S’s assets and liabilities, 
then adjusts for the 20% of S not owned by using an account called 
“Minority Interest”. 

¾  Is Minority Interest a liability or equity? 
  Has characteristics of both.  It may be classified as either SE or a 
liability claim of indeterminate amount and life.

Consolidation Method when Price Paid ≠ BV


¾  We previously assumed that 
BV of S Corp’s S. E. = Amount paid for S Corp. 

In practice this is unlikely.  What if:

BV of S Corp’s S. E. ≠ Amount paid for S Corp? 


¾	 We must first adjust S Corp’s balance sheet to produce consolidated
books. 
(1) Write-up the identifiable assets of S to their fair market values.
(2) 	 Record as goodwill any excess of purchase price over the total
fair market value of these assets. 

¾	 Formally, goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired firm over
the current fair market value of the separately identifiable net assets 
(assets - liabilities).

Idea Behind Consolidation Adjustments


¾	 Consolidation combines the financial statements of 
parent and subsidiaries, as if the parent purchased
the net assets of the subsidiaries, resulting in one set
of F/S. 
¾  But there are numerous items that appear twice. 
  Adjustments correct for the double-counting that would
result from simply adding the financial statements
together. 
  Some other adjustments we have not addressed: 
Inter-company receivables and payables 
•	
Inter-company sales, costs, and profits 
•	
•	 Tracing the effects of FV adjustments of S’s net assets in 
subsequent years.

Consolidation:  Purchase vs. Pooling 


¾	 The above examples use the purchase method of accounting 
for acquisitions.  Until recently, use of the pooling method 
was required in some cases. 
¾  The pooling method: 
  Combined the company’s balance sheets “as is” – no 
revaluation of subsidiary’s assets, no goodwill (i.e., pretend 
that there was no purchase transaction). 
  Included the incomes of the entities for all prior periods 
without regard to the date of the combination (i.e., pretend the 
entities had always been combined).

Everyone out of the pool!


¾	 SFAS 141 eliminated the pooling method.  All acquisitions 
now must use the purchase method. 
¾	 Also, SFAS 142 eliminated the requirement to amortize 
goodwill.  Instead, goodwill must be periodically tested for 
impairment. 
¾	 Question: What will happen to the earnings of companies 
that have goodwill on their balance sheets?

Summary


¾  Accounting for long-term investments depends on degree of 
influence as determined by percentage holdings. 
¾  In equity method and consolidation, the investment account: 
  increases when investee earns profits and 
  decreases and when investee pays dividends. 
¾  Consolidation process: 
  Shows the combined F/S of parent and sub, and 
  Removes any double-counting 
¾  Acquirer records goodwill when it pays more than fair value 
of the investee’s net assets.
