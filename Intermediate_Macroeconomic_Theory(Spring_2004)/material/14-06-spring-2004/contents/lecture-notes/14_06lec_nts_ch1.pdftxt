Introduction and Growth Facts

1.1 Introduction

• In 2000, GDP per capita in the United States was $32500 (valued at 1995 $ prices).
This high income level reﬂects a high standard of living.

• In contrast, standard of living is much lower in many other countries: $9000 in Mexico,
$4000 in China, $2500 in India, and only $1000 in Nigeria (all ﬁgures adjusted for

purchasing power parity).

• How can countries with low level of GDP per person catch up with the high levels
enjoyed by the United States or the G7?

• Only by high growth rates sustained for long periods of time.

• Smal l diﬀerences in growth rates over long periods of time can make huge diﬀerences
in ﬁnal outcomes.

• US per-capita GDP grew by a factor ≈ 10 from 1870 to 2000: In 1995 prices, it was
$3300 in 1870 and $32500 in 2000.1 Average growth rate was ≈ 1.75%. If US had grown
with .75% (like India, Pakistan, or the Philippines), its GDP would be only $8700 in
1990 (i.e., ≈ 1/4 of the actual one, similar to Mexico, less than Portugal or Greece). If
US had grown with 2.75% (like Japan or Taiwan), its GDP would be $112000 in 1990

(i.e., 3.5 times the actual one).

• At a growth rate of 1%, our children will have ≈ 1.4 our income. At a growth rate of
3%, our children will have ≈ 2.5 our income. Some East Asian countries grew by 6%
over 1960-1990; this is a factor of ≈ 6 within just one generation!!!

• Once we appreciate the importance of sustained growth, the question is natural: What
can do to make growth faster?

• Equivalently: What are the factors that explain diﬀerences in economic growth, and
how can we control these factors?

• In order to prescribe policies that will promote growth, we need to understand what
are the determinants of economic growth, as well as what are the eﬀects of economic

growth on social welfare. That’s exactly where Growth Theory comes into picture...

1 Let y0 be the GDP per capital at year 0, yT the GDP per capita at year T , and x the average annual
growth rate over that period. Then, yT = (1 + x)T y0 . Taking logs, we compute ln yT − ln y0 = T ln(1 + x) ≈
T x, or equivalenty x ≈ (ln yT − ln y0 )/T .

1.2 The World Distribution of Income Levels and Growth

Rates

• As we mentioned before, in 2000 there were many countries that had much lower
standards of living than the United States. This fact reﬂects the high cross-country

dispersion in the level of income.

• Figure 12 shows the distribution of GDP per capita in 2000 across the 147 countries in
the Summers and Heston dataset. The richest country was Luxembourg, with $44000

GDP per person. The United States came second, with $32500. The G7 and most of

the OECD countries ranked in the top 25 positions, together with Singapore, Hong

Kong, Taiwan, and Cyprus. Most African countries, on the other hand, fell in the

bottom 25 of the distribution. Tanzania was the poorest country, with only $570 per

person — that is, less than 2% of the income in the United States or Luxemburg!

• Figure 2 shows the distribution of GDP per capita in 1960 across the 113 countries
for which data are available. The richest country then was Switzerland, with $15000;

the United States was again second, with $13000, and the poorest country was again

Tanzania, with $450.

• The cross-country dispersion of income was thus as wide in 1960 as in 2000. Never-
theless, there were some important movements during this 40-year period. Argentina,

Venezuela, Uruguay, Israel, and South Africa were in the top 25 in 1960, but none made

it to the top 25 in 2000. On the other hand, China, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, India,

and Bangladesh grew fast enough to escape the bottom 25 between 1960 and 1970.

2 Figures 1, 2 and 3 are reproduced from Barro (2003).

These large movements in the distribution of income reﬂects sustained diﬀerences in

the rate of economic growth.

• Figure 3 shows the distribution of the growth rates the countries experienced between
1960 and 2000. Just as there is a great dispersion in income levels, there is a great

dispersion in growth rates. The mean growth rate was 1.8% per annum; that is, the

world on average was twice as rich in 2000 as in 1960. The United States did slightly

better than the mean. The fastest growing country was Taiwan, with a annual rate as

high as 6%, which accumulates to a factor of 10 over the 40-year period. The slowest
growing country was Zambia, with an negative rate at −1.8%; Zambia’s residents show
their income shrinking to half between 1960 and 2000.

• Most East Asian countries (Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, Thailand,
China, and Japan), together with Bostwana (an outlier as compared to other sub-

Saharan African countries), Cyprus, Romania, and Mauritus, had the most stellar

growth performances; they were the “growth miracles” of our times. Some OECD

countries (Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Greece, Luxemburg and Norway) also made it

to the top 20 of the growth-rates chart. On the other hand, 18 out of the bottom 20

were sub-Saharan African countries. Other notable “growth disasters” were Venezuela,

Chad and Iraq.

1.3 Unconditional versus Conditional Convergence

• There are important movements in the world income distribution, reﬂecting substantial
diﬀerences in growth rates. Nonetheless, on average income and productivity diﬀer-

ences are very persistent.

Lecture Notes

• Figure 43 graphs a country’s GDP per worker in 1988 (normalized by the US level)
against the same country’s GDP per worker in 1960 (again normalized by the US level).

Most observations close to the 45o -line, meaning that most countries did not experi-

enced a dramatic change in their relative position in the world income distribution. In

other words, income diﬀerences across countries are very persistent.

• This also means that poor countries on average do not grow faster than rich countries.
And another way to state the same fact is that unconditional convergence is zero. That

is, if we ran the regression

∆ ln y2000−1960 = α + β · ln y1960 ,
the estimated coeﬃcient β is zero.

• On the other hand, consider the regression

∆ ln y1960−90 = α + β · ln y1960 + γ · X1960
where X1960 is a set of country-speciﬁc controls, such as levels of education, ﬁscal and
monetary policies, market competition, etc. Then, the estimated coeﬃcient β turns

to be positive (in particular, around 2% per annum). Therefore, if we look in a group

of countries that share similar characteristics (as measured by X ), the countries with

lower intial income tend to grow faster than their rich counterparts, and therefore the

poor countries tend to catch up with the rich countries in the same group. This is

what we call conditional convergence.

• Conditional convergence is illustrated in Figures 5 and 6, for the group of OECD
countries and the group of US states, respectively.

1.4 Stylized Facts

The following are stylized facts that should guide us in the modeling of economic growth

(Kaldor, Kuznets, Romer, Lucas, Barro, Mankiw-Romer-Weil, and others):

1. In the short run, important ﬂuctuations: Output, employment, investment, and con-

sumptio vary a lot across booms and recessions.

2. In the long run, balanced growth: Output per worker and capital per worker (Y /L and

K/L) grow at roughly constant, and certainly not vanishing, rates. The capital-to-

output ratio (K/Y ) is nearly constant. The return to capital (r ) is roughly constant,

whereas the wage rate (w) grows at the same rates as output. And, the income shares

of labor and capital (wL/Y and rK/Y ) stay roughly constant.

3. Substantial cross-country diﬀerences in both income levels and growth rates.

4. Persistent diﬀerences versus conditional convergence.

5. Formal education: Highly correlated with high levels of income (obviously two-direction

causality); together with diﬀerences in saving rates can “explain” a large fraction of the

cross-country diﬀerences in output; an important predictor of high growth performance.

6. R&D and IT: Most powerful engines of growth (but require high skills at the ﬁrst

place).

7. Government policies: Taxation, infrastructure, inﬂation, law enforcement, property

rights and corruption are important determinants of growth performance.

8. Democracy: An inverted U-shaped relation; that is, autarchies are bad for growht, and

democracies are good, but too much democracy can slow down growth.

9. Openness: International trade and ﬁnancial integration promote growth (but not nec-

essarily if it is between the North and the South).

10. Inequality: The Kunzets curve, namely an inverted U-shaped relation between income

inequality and GDP per capita (growth rates as well).

11. Ferility: High fertility rates correlated with levels of income and low rates of economic

growth; and the process of development follows a Malthus curve, meaning that fertility

rates initially increase and then fall as the economy develops.

12. Financial markets and risk-sharing: Banks, credit, stock markets, social insurance.

13. Structural transformation: agriculture→manifacture→services.
14. Urbanization: family production→organized production; small vilages→big cities; ex-
tended domestic trade.

15. Other institutional and social factors: colonial history, ethnic heterogeneity, social

norms.

The theories of economic growth that we will review in this course seek to explain how

all the above factors interrelate with the process of economic growth. Once we understand

better the “mechanics” of economic growth, we will be able, not only to predict economic

performance for given a set of fundamentals (positive analysis ), but also to identify what

government policies or socio-economic reforms can promote social welfare in the long run

(normative analysis ).
