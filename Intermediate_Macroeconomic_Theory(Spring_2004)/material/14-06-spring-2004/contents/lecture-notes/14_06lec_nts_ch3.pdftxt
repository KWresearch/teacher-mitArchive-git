The Neoclassical Growth Model

• In the Solow model, agents in the economy (or the dictator) follow a simplistic linear
rule for consumption and investment. In the Ramsey model, agents (or the dictator)

choose consumption and investment optimally so as to maximize their individual utility

(or social welfare).

3.1 The Social Planner

• In this section, we start the analysis of the neoclassical growth model by considering
the optimal plan of a benevolent social planner, who chooses the static and intertem-

poral allocation of resources in the economy so as to maximize social welfare. We

will later show that the allocations that prevail in a decentralized competitive market

environment coincide with the allocations dictated by the social planner.

• Together with consumption and saving, we also endogenize labor supply.

3.1.1 Preferences

• Preferences are deﬁned over streams of consumption and leisure {xt}∞t=0 , where xt =
(ct , zt ), and are represented by a utility function U : X∞ → R, where X is the domain
of xt , such that

U ({xt}∞t=0) = U (x0 , x1 , ...)

• We say that preferences are recursive if there is a function W : X × R → R such that,
for all {xt}∞t=0 ,

U (x0 , x1 , ...) = W [x0 , U (x1 , x2 , ...)]
We can then represent preferences as follows: A consumption-leisure stream {xt}∞t=0
induces a utility stream {Ut}∞t=0 according to the recursion

Ut = W (xt , Ut+1).

That is, utility in period t is given as a function of consumption in period t and utility

in period t + 1. W is called a utility aggregator. Finally, note that recursive preferences,

as deﬁned above, are both time-consistent and stationary.

• We say that preferences are additively separable if there are functions υ t : X → R such
that
∞Xt=0
U ({xt}∞t=0 ) =
We then interpret υ t(xt) as the utility enjoyed in period 0 from consumption in period
t + 1.

υ t(xt).

• Throughout our analysis, we will assume that preferences are both recursive and addi-
tively separable. In other words, we impose that the utility aggregator W is linear in

44

Lecture Notes

ut+1 : There is a function U : R → R and a scalar β ∈ R such that W (x, u) = U (x)+βu.
We can thus represent preferences in recursive form as

Ut = U (xt) + βUt+1 .

Alternatively,

Ut =

β τ U (xt+τ )

∞Xτ =0
• β is called the discount factor. For preferences to be well deﬁned (that is, for the
inﬁnite sum to converge) we need β ∈ (−1, +1). Monotonicity of preferences imposes
β > 0. Therefore, we restrict β ∈ (0, 1). The discount rate is given by ρ such that
β = 1/(1 + ρ).

• U is sometimes called the per-period felicity or utility function. We let z > 0 denote
the maximal amount of time per period. We accordingly let X = R+ × [0, z ]. We ﬁnally
impose that U is neoclassical, in that it satisﬁes the following properties:

1. U is continuous and (although not always necessary) twice diﬀerentiable.

2. U is strictly increasing and strictly concave:

Uc (c, z ) > 0 > Ucc (c, z)

Uz (c, z ) > 0 > Uzz (c, z)

U 2
cz < UccUzz

3. U satisﬁes the Inada conditions

3.1.2 Technology and the Resource Constraint

• We abstract from population growth and exogenous technological change.
• The time constraint is given by

zt + lt ≤ z .
We usually normalize z = 1 and thus interpret zt and lt as the fraction of time that is
devoted to leisure and production, respectively.

• The resource constraint is given by

ct + it ≤ yt

• Let F (K, L) be a neoclassical technology and let f (κ) = F (κ, 1) be the intensive form
of F . Output in the economy is given by

yt = F (kt , lt) = ltf (κt),

where

is the capital-labor ratio.

κt =

kt
lt

• Capital accumulates according to
kt+1 = (1 − δ)kt + it .

(Alternatively, interpret l as eﬀective labor and δ as the eﬀective depreciation rate.)

• Finally, we impose the following natural non-negativitly constraints:
ct ≥ 0, zt ≥ 0,
lt ≥ 0, kt ≥ 0.
46

Lecture Notes

• Combining the above, we can rewrite the resource constraint as

and the time constraint as

with

ct + kt+1 ≤ F (kt , lt ) + (1 − δ)kt ,

zt = 1 − lt ,

ct ≥ 0,

lt ∈ [0, 1], kt ≥ 0.

3.1.3 The Ramsey Problem

• The social planner chooses a plan {ct , lt , kt+1}∞t=0 so as to maximize utility sub ject to
the resource constraint of the economy, taking initial k0 as given:
∞Xt=0
ct + kt+1 ≤ (1 − δ)kt + F (kt , lt ), ∀t ≥ 0,
lt ∈ [0, 1], kt+1 ≥ 0., ∀t ≥ 0,
ct ≥ 0,
k0 > 0 g iven.

β tU (ct , 1 − lt)

max U0 =

3.1.4 Optimal Control

• Let µt denote the Lagrange multiplier for the resource constraint. The Lagrangian of
the social planner’s problem is
∞Xt=0

µt [(1 − δ)kt + F (kt , lt) − kt+1 − ct ]

• Deﬁne λt ≡ β tµt and

Ht ≡ H (kt , kt+1 , ct , lt , λt) ≡
≡ U (ct , 1 − lt) + λt [(1 − δ)kt + F (kt , lt ) − kt+1 − ct ]

H is called the Hamiltonian of the problem.

L0 =

Lt = Ht + βLt+1 .
• Given kt , ct and lt enter only the period t utility and resource constraint; (ct , lt ) thus
appears only in Ht . Similarly, kt ,enter only the period t and t + 1 utility and resource
constraints; they thus appear only in Ht and Ht+1 . Therefore,

taking (kt , kt+2 ) as given.

• We henceforth assume an interior solution. As long as kt > 0, interior solution is indeed
ensured by the Inada conditions on F and U.

= FL(kt , lt )

and

Uc (ct , zt)
= 1 − δ + FK (kt+1 , lt+1).
βUc(ct+1 , zt+1 )
• Both conditions impose equality between marginal rates of substitution and marginal
rate of transformation. The ﬁrst condition means that the marginal rate of substitution

between consumption and leisure equals the marginal product of labor. The second

condition means that the marginal rate of intertemporal substitution in consumption

equals the marginal capital of capital net of depreciation (plus one). This last condition

is called the Euler condition.

More generally,

λt = Uc(ct , lt)

represents the marginal utility of capital in period t and will equal the slope of the

value function at k = kt in the dynamic-programming representation of the problem.

be

and the Kuhn-Tucker condition with respect to kT +1 would give

β tHt

equivalently

µT = β T λT ≥ 0 and kT +1 ≥ 0, with β T λT kT +1 = 0.

The latter means that either kT +1 = 0, or otherwise it better be that the shadow value
of kT +1 is zero. When the horizon is inﬁnite, the terminal condition β T λT kT +1 = 0 is
replaced by the transversality condition

Equivalently, using λt = Uc (ct , zt ), we write the transversality condition as

β tλtkt+1 = 0.

lim
t→∞

β tUc(ct , zt)kt+1 = 0.

lim
t→∞

The above means that, as time passes, the (discounted) shadow value of capital con-

verges to zero.

only if

• Remark: We proved necessity of (3.1) and (3.2) essentially by a perturbation argument,
and (3.3) is trivial. We did not prove necessity of (3.4), neither suﬃciency of this

set of conditions. One can prove both necessity and suﬃciency using optimal-control

techniques. Alternatively, we can use dynamic programming; the proof of the necessity

and suﬃciency of the Euler and transversality conditions is provided in Stokey and

Lucas.

• Note that the (3.1) can be solved for lt = l(ct , kt ), which we can then substitute into
(3.2) and (3.3). We are then left with a system of two diﬀerence equations in two

variables, namely ct and kt . The intitial condition and the transversality condition
then give the boundary conditions for this system.

V is called the Value Function.

• Deﬁne k by the unique solution to

k = (1 − δ)k + F (k , 1)
52

Lecture Notes

and note that k represents an upper bound on the level of capital that can be sustained

in any steady state. Without serious loss of generality, we will henceforth restrict
kt ∈ [0, k ].

• Let B be the set of continuous and bounded functions v : [0, k ] → R and consider the
mapping T : B → B deﬁned as follows:

T v(k) = max U (c, 1 − l) + β v (k 0 )
c + k 0 ≤ (1 − δ)k + F (k , l)
s.t.
k 0 ∈ [0, k ], c ∈ [0, F (k , 1)],
l ∈ [0, 1].

The conditions we have imposed on U and F imply that T is a contraction mapping. It
follows that T has a unique ﬁxed point V = T V and this ﬁxed point gives the solution
to the planner’s problem:

Proposition 13 There is a unique V that solves the Bel lman equation

V (k) = max U (c, 1 − l) + β V (k 0 )
c + k 0 ≤ (1 − δ)k + F (k , l)
s.t.
k 0 ∈ [0, k ],
c ∈ [0, F (k , 1)],
l ∈ [0, 1].

V is continuous, diﬀerentiable, and strictly concave. V (k0 ) gives the solution for the social
planner’s problem.

Proposition 14 Let

[c(k), l(k), G(k)] = arg max{...}.
53

George-Marios Angeletos

c(k), l(k), G(k) are continuous; c(k) and G(k) are increasing. The plan {ct , lt , kt}∞t=0 is opti-
mal if and only if it satisﬁes

ct = c(kt )

lt = l(kt)

kt+1 = G(kt )

with k0 historical ly given.

• Remark: The proofs of the above propositions, as well as the proof of the necessity
and suﬃciency of the Euler and transversality conditions, are provided in Stokey and

Lucas. Because of time constraints, I will skip these proofs and concentrate on the

characterization of the optimal plan.

• The Lagrangian for the DP problem is

L = U (c, 1 − l) + β V (k 0 ) + λ[(1 − δ)k + F (k , l) − k 0 − c]

t + Rt bj
t ≤ y j
cj
t + ij

t = rtk j
t + αj Πt ,
where rt denotes the rental rate of capital, wt denotes the wage rate, Rt denotes the
interest rate on risk-free bonds. Household j accumulates capital according to

and bonds according to

In equilibrium, ﬁrm proﬁts are zero, because of CRS. It follows that Πt = 0 and we
can rewrite the household budget as

t+1 ≤ (1 − δ + rt)k j
t+1 + bj
t + k j
cj
t .

• The natural non-negativity constraint

k j
t+1 ≥ 0
is imposed on capital holdings, but no short-sale constraint is imposed on bond hold-

ings. That is, household can either lend or borrow in risk-free bonds. We only impose

the following natural borrowing limit

t+1 ≤ (1 − δ + rt+1)k j
−(1 + Rt+1 )bj
t+1 +

wτ .

qτ
qt+1

∞Xτ =t+1
= (1 + Rt)qt+1 .

where

1
qt ≡
(1 + R0 )(1 + R1)...(1 + Rt)
This constraint simply requires that the net debt position of the household does not

exceed the present value of the labor income he can attain by working all time.

56

Lecture Notes

• Note that simple arbitrage between bonds and capital implies that, in any equilibrium,

Rt = rt − δ .

That is, the interest rate on riskless bonds must equal the rental rate of capital net
of depreciation. If Rt < rt − δ , all individuals would like to short-sell bonds (up to
their borrowing constraint) and invest into capital. If Rt > rt − δ , capital would be
dominated by bonds, and nobody in the economy would invest in capital. In the ﬁrst

case, there would be excess supply for bonds in the aggregate. In the second case, there

would be excess demand for bonds and no investment in the aggregate. In equilibrium,
Rt and rt must adjust so that Rt = rt − δ .
• Provided that Rt = rt − δ , the household is indiﬀerent between bonds and capital. The
t and bj
“portfolio” choice between k j
t is thus indeterminate. What is pinned down is
only the total asset position, aj
t = bj
t + k j
t . The budget constraint then reduces to

t + wt lj

Uc (cj

with equality whenever aj
t+1 > at+1 . That is, as long as the borrowing constraint does
not bind, households equate their marginal rate of intertemporal substitution with the

(common) return on capital. On the other hand, if the borrowing constraint is binding,

the marginal utility of consumption today may exceed the marginal beneﬁt of savings:

The household would like to borrow, but it’s not capable of.

• For general borrowing limit at , there is nothing to ensure that the Euler condition
must be satisﬁed with equality. For example, if we had speciﬁed at = 0, it likely the
borrowing constraint will bind, especially if β (1 + Rt ) < 1 and wt is low as compared to
its long-run mean. But if at is the natural borrowing limit, and the utility satisﬁes the
Inada condition Uc → ∞ as c → 0, then a simple argument ensures that the borrowing
τ = 0 for all τ ≥ t,
constraint can never bind: Suppose that at+1 = at+1 . Then cj
τ = z j
implying Uc (cj
t+1 , z j
t+1) = ∞ and therefore necessarily Uc (cj
t , z j
t ) < β [1 + Rt ]Uc (cj

t ),
unless cj
t = 0 which would be optimal only if at = at . Therefore, unless a0 = a0 to start
with, the borrowing which would contradict the Euler condition. Therefore, at > at at
all dates, and the Euler condition is satisﬁed with equality:

t = β [1 + Rt ] λj
• Moreover, if the borrowing constraint never binds, iterating λj
t+1 implies
t = qtλj
β tλj
0 .

where µ > 0 is Lagrange multiplier associated to the intertermporal budget. You can

check that these conditions coincide with the one derived before.

• Finally, note that the ob jective is strictly concave and the constraint is linear. There-
fore, the FOCs together with the transversality are both necessary and suﬃcient. We

conclude:

3.2.2 Firms

• There is an arbitrary number Mt of ﬁrms in period t, indexed by m ∈ [0, Mt ]. Firms
employ labor and rent capital in competitive labor and capital markets, have access

to the same neoclassical technology, and produce a homogeneous good that they sell

competitively to the households in the economy.

t and Lm
t denote the amount of capital and labor that ﬁrm m employs in period
t. Then, the proﬁts of that ﬁrm in period t are given by

• The ﬁrms seeks to maximize proﬁts. The FOCs for an interior solution require
t , Lm
FK (K m
t ) = rt .

t , Lm
FL(K m
t ) = wt .

You can think of the ﬁrst condition as the ﬁrm’s demand for labor and the second

condition as the ﬁrm’s demand for capital.

• As we showed before in the Solow model, under CRS, an interior solution to the ﬁrms’
problem to exist if and only if rt and wt imply the same K m
t . This is the case if
t /Lm
and only if there is some Xt ∈ (0, ∞) such that
rt = f 0 (Xt )
wt = f (Xt ) − f 0 (Xt )Xt
where f (k) ≡ F (k , 1). Provided so, ﬁrm proﬁts are zero
Πm
t = 0

and the FOCs reduce to

t = XtLm
K m
t .

That is, the FOCs pin down the capital labor ratio for each ﬁrm (K m
t ), but not the
t /Lm
size of the ﬁrm (Lm
t ). Moreover, because all ﬁrms have access to the same technology,
they use exactly the same capital-labor ratio. (See our earlier analysis in the Solow

model for more details.)

• Remark: In the above deﬁnition we surpassed the distribution of ﬁrm proﬁts (or the
stock market). As we explained before in the Solow model, this is without any serious

loss of generality because ﬁrm proﬁts (and thus ﬁrm value) is zero.

3.2.5 General Equilibrium: Existence, Uniqueness, and Charac-

terization

• In the Solow model, we had showed that the decentralized market economy and the
centralized dictatorial economy were isomorphic. A similar result applies in the Ramsey

model. The following proposition combines the ﬁrst and second fundamental welfare

theorems, as applied in the Ramsey model:

Proposition 17 The set of competitive equilibrium al locations for the market economy co-

incide with the set of Pareto al locations for the social planner.

0 + bj
I will sketch the proof assuming that (a) in the market economy, k j
• Proof.
0 is
equal across all j ; and (b) the social planner equates utility across agents. For the more

general case, we need to extend the social planner’s problem to allow for an unequal dis-

tribution of consumption and wealth across agents. The set of competitive equilibrium

allocations coincides with the set of Pareto optimal allocations, each diﬀerent compet-

itive equilibrium allocation corresponding to a diﬀerent system of Pareto weights in

65

George-Marios Angeletos

the utility of the social planner. I also surpass the details about the boundedness of

prices. For a more careful analysis, see Stokey and Lucas.

a. We ﬁrst consider how the solution to the social planner’s problem can be imple-

mented as a competitive equilibrium. The social planner’s optimal plan is given by
{ct , lt , kt}∞t=0 such that

= FL(kt , lt ), ∀t ≥ 0,

Uz (ct , 1 − lt )
Uc (ct , 1 − lt )
Uc (ct , 1 − lt )
= β [1 − δ + FK (kt+1 , lt+1 )], ∀t ≥ 0,
Uc (ct+1 , 1 − lt+1 )
ct + kt+1 = (1 − δ)kt + F (kt , lt), ∀t ≥ 0,
β tUc (ct , 1 − lt)kt+1 = 0.
k0 > 0 given, and
lim
t→∞
Choose a price path {Rt , rt , wt}∞t=0 such that

Rt = rt − δ ,
rt = FK (kt , lt ) = f 0 (κt ),
wt = FL(kt , lt ) = f (κt ) − f 0 (κt )κt ,
where κt ≡ kt/lt . Trivially, these prices ensure that the FOCs are satisﬁed for every
t = ct , lj
household and every ﬁrm if we set cj
t = lt and K m
t = kt for all j and m.
t /Lm
Next, we need to verify that the proposed allocation satisﬁes the budget constraints of

each household. From the resource constraint of the economy,

ct + kt+1 = F (kt , lt ) + (1 − δ)kt .

From CRS and the FOCs for the ﬁrms,

F (kt , lt) = rtkt + wt lt .

66

Lecture Notes

Combining, we get

ct + kt+1 = (1 − δ + rt)kt + wt lt .
t + bj
t = k j
t = lt , and aj
t = ct , l j
As long as cj
t = kt for all j, t, and Rt = rt − δ for all t, it

follows that

t + wt l j
t + (1 + Rt )bj
t+1 = (1 − δ + rt )k j
t+1 + bj
t + k j
cj
t ,
which proves that the budget constraint is satisﬁed for every j, t. Finally, it is trivial

to that the proposed allocations clear the bond, capital, and labor markets.

b. We next consider the converse, how a competitive equilibrium coincides with the

Pareto solution. Because agents have the same preferences, face the same prices, and

are endowed with identical level of initial wealth, and because the solution to the

individual’s problem is essentially unique (where essentially means unique with respect
to cj
t , lj
t , and aj
t = k j
t + bj
t but indeterminate with respect to the portfolio choice between
k j
t = lt and aj
t = ct , lj
t ), every agent picks the same allocations: cj

t = at for all

Uc (ct , 1 − lt )
= β [1 − δ + rt ], ∀t ≥ 0,

β tUc (ct , 1 − lt)at+1 = 0.
a0 > 0 given, and
lim
t→∞

= wt , ∀t ≥ 0,

From the market clearing conditions for the capital and bond markets, the aggregate

supply of bonds is zero and thus

at = kt .

67

George-Marios Angeletos

Next, by the FOCs for the ﬁrms,

and by CRS

rt = FK (kt , lt )

wt = FL(kt , lt)

rtkt + wt lt = F (kt , lt)

Combining the above with the FOCs and the budget constraints gives

ct + kt+1 = F (kt , lt) + (1 − δ)kt , ∀t ≥ 0,
which is simply the resource constraint of the economy. Finally, and limt→∞ β tUc (ct , 1−
lt )at+1 = 0 with at+1 = kt+1 implies the social planner’s transversality condition, while
a0 = k0 gives the initial condition. This concludes the proof that the competitive
QED
equilibrium coincides with the social planner’s optimal plan.

• Following the above, we have:
Proposition 18 An equilibrium always exists. The al location of production across ﬁrms

is indeterminate, and the portfolio choice of each household is also indeterminate, but the

equilibrium is unique as regards prices, aggregate al locations, and the distribution of con-
sumption, labor and wealth across households. If initial wealth k j
0 + bj
0 is equal across al l
t + bj
agent j , then cj
t = ct , lj
t = lt and k j
t = kt for al l j. The equilibrium is then given by an
al location {ct , lt , kt}∞t=0 such that, for al l t ≥ 0,
Uz (ct , 1 − lt)
Uc (ct , 1 − lt )
Uc (ct , 1 − lt)
= β [1 − δ + FK (kt+1 , lt+1)],
Uc(ct+1 , 1 − lt+1)
kt+1 = F (kt , lt) + (1 − δ)kt − ct ,

= FL (kt , lt),

68

Lecture Notes

and such that

k0 > 0 given,

and

lim
t→∞

β tUc (ct , 1 − lt)kt+1 = 0.

Final ly, equilibrium prices are given by

Rt = R(kt) ≡ f 0 (kt) − δ ,
rt = r(kt ) ≡ f 0 (kt ),
wt = w(kt ) ≡ f (kt) − f 0 (kt)kt ,

where R0 (k ) = r 0 (k) < 0 < w 0 (k ).

Proof. The characterization of the equilibrium follows from our previous analysis. Existence

and uniqueness of the equilibrium follow directly from existence and uniqueness of the social

planner’s optimum, given the coincidence of competitive and Pareto allocations. See Stokey
QED

and Lucas for more details.

3.3 Steady State and Transitional Dynamics

3.3.1 Steady State

• A steady state is a ﬁxed point (c, l, k) of the dynamic system. A trivial steady state is
at c = l = k = 0. We now consider interior steady states.

Proposition 19 There exists a unique steady state (c∗ , l∗ , k∗ ) > 0. The steady-state values
of the capital-labor ratio, the productivity of labor, the output-capital ratio, the consumption-

capital ratio, the wage rate, the rental rate of capital, and the interest rate are al l independent

of the utility function U and are pinned down uniquely by the technology F , the depreciation

69

George-Marios Angeletos

rate δ , and the discount rate ρ. In particular, the capital-labor ratio κ∗ ≡ k∗/l∗ equates the
net-of-depreciation MPK with the discount rate,

f 0 (κ∗) − δ = ρ,
and is a decreasing function of ρ + δ , where ρ ≡ 1/β − 1. Similarly,
r∗ = ρ + δ ,
R∗ = ρ,

Uz (c∗ , 1 − l∗)
Uc (c∗ , 1 − l∗)
1 = β [1 − δ + FK (k∗ , l∗)],
c∗ = F (k∗ , l∗) − δk∗ ,
Let κ ≡ k/l denote the capital-labor ratio at the stead state. By CRS,
F (k , l) = lf (κ)

FK (k , l) = f 0 (κ)
FL(k , l) = f (κ) − f 0 (κ)κ
F (k , l)
= φ(κ)
k
where f (κ) ≡ F (κ, 1) and φ(κ) ≡ f (κ)/κ. The Euler condition then reduces to
1 = β [1 − δ + f 0 (κ∗ )]
70

Lecture Notes

That is, the capital-labor ratio is pinned down uniquely by the equation of the MPK, net of

depreciation, with the discount rate

f 0 (κ∗ ) − δ = ρ

where ρ ≡ 1/β − 1 or, equivalently, β ≡ 1/(1 + ρ). The gross rental rate of capital and the
net interest rate are thus

while the wage rate is

r∗ = ρ + δ and R∗ = ρ,

w∗ = FL: (κ∗ , 1)

while, by the resource constraint, the consumption-capital ratio is given by

The comparative statics are then trivial.

3.3.2 Transitional Dynamics

• Consider the condition that determined labor supply:
Uz (ct , 1 − lt )
Uc (ct , 1 − lt )
We can solve this for lt as a function of contemporaneous consumption and capital:

= FL (kt , lt).

lt = l(ct , kt ).

71

George-Marios Angeletos

Substituting then into the Euler condition and the resource constraint, we conclude:

Uc (ct , 1 − l(ct , kt))
= β [1 − δ + FK (kt+1 , l(ct+1 , kt+1))]
Uc (ct , 1 − l(ct , kt))
kt+1 = F (kt , l(ct , kt )) + (1 − δ)kt − ct

This is a system of two ﬁrst-order diﬀerence equation in ct and kt . Together with the
initial condition (k0 given) and the transversality condition, this system pins down the
path of {ct , kt}∞t=0 .

3.4 The Neoclassical Growth Model with Exogenous

Labor

3.4.1 Steady State and Transitional Dynamics

• Suppose that leisure is not valued, or that the labor supply is exogously ﬁxed. Either
way, let lt = 1 for all t. Suppose further that preferences exhibit constant elasticity of
intertemporal substitution:

c1−1/θ − 1
1 − 1/θ
θ > 0 is reciprocal of the elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption and is called

U (c) =

,

the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. Under these restrictions, the dynamics

reduce to

µ ct+1
ct ¶θ
= β [1 + f 0 (kt+1) − δ ] = β [1 + Rt ],
kt+1 = f (kt) + (1 − δ)kt − ct .

• Finally, we know that the transversality condition is satisﬁed if and only if the path
72

Lecture Notes

converges to the steady state, and we can also so that the capital stock converges

monotonically to its steady state value. We conclude:

Proposition 20 Suppose that labor is exogenously ﬁxed and preferences exhibit CEIS. The
path {ct , kt}∞t=0 is the equilibrium path of the economy (and the solution to the social planner’s
problem) if and only if

for al l t, with

ct+1
= {β [1 + f 0 (kt+) − δ ]}θ ,
ct
kt+1 = f (kt) + (1 − δ)kt − ct ,

k0 given and lim
t→∞

kt = k∗ ,

where k∗ is the steady state value of capital:

f 0 (k∗) = ρ + δ

For any initial k0 < k∗ (k0 > k∗ ), the capital stock kt is increasing (respectively, decreasing)
over time and converges to asymptotical ly to k∗ . Similarly, the rate of per-capita consumption
growth ct+1/ct is positive and decreasing (respectively, negative and increasing) over time and
converges monotonical ly to 0.

Proof. The policy rule kt+1 = G(kt ) is increasing, continuous, and intersects with the
45o only at k = 0 and k = k∗ . See Lucas and Stokey for the complete proof. The same
argument as in the Solow model then implies that {kt}∞t=0 is monotonic and converges to
k∗ . The monotonicity and convergence of {ct+1/ct}∞t=0 then follows immediately from the
monotonicity and convergence of {kt}∞t=0 together with the fact that f 0 (k) is decreasing.
• We will see these results also graphically in the phase diagram, below.
73

3.4.2 Continuous Time

• Taking logs of the Euler condition and approximating ln β = − ln(1 + ρ) ≈ −ρ and
ln[1 − δ + f 0 (kt)] ≈ f 0 (kt) − δ , we can write the Euler condition as

ln ct+1 − ln ct ≈ θ [f 0 (kt+1) − δ − ρ].

We can also rewrite the resource constraint as

kt+1 − kt = f (kt ) − δkt − ct .

• The approximation turns out to be exact when time is continuous:

Proposition 21 Suppose that time is continuous. Like before, assume that labor is exoge-
nously ﬁxed and preferences exhibit CEIS. The path {ct , kt}t∈R+ is the equilibrium path of the
economy (and the solution to the social planner’s problem) if and only if

˙ct
ct

= θ [f 0 (kt ) − δ − ρ] = θ[Rt − ρ],
˙kt = f (kt ) − δkt − ct ,

for al l t, with

where k∗ is the steady state value of capital:

k0 given and lim
t→∞

kt = k∗ ,

f 0 (k∗) = ρ + δ

Proof. See Barro and Sala-i-Martin for details.

3.4.3 Phase Diagram (Figure 1)

• We can now use the phase diagram to describe the transitional dynamics of the econ-
omy. See Figure 1.

• The ˙k = 0 locus is given by (c, k) such that
˙k = f (k) − δk − c = 0 ⇔
c = f (k ) − δk
On the other hand, the ˙c = 0 locus is given by (c, k) such that

˙c = cθ[f 0 (k) − δ − ρ] = 0 ⇔
k = k∗

Remark: Obviously, c = 0 also ensures ˙c = 0, but this corresponds to the trivial and

unstable steady state c = 0 = k , so I will ignore it for the rest of the discussion.

• The steady state is simply the intersection of the two loci:
˙c = ˙k = 0 ⇔
c = c∗ ≡ f (k∗ ) − δk∗ 

k = k∗ ≡ (f 0 )−1(ρ + δ)
• The ˙c = 0 and ˙k = 0 loci are depicted in Figure 1. Note that the two loci partition the
(c, k ) space in four regions. We now examine what is the direction of change in c and
k in each of these four regions.

or {c = k = 0}

• Consider ﬁrst the direction of ˙c. If 0 < k < k ∗ [k > k∗ ], then and only then ˙c > 0
[ ˙c < 0]. That is, c increases [decreases] with time whenever (c, k) lies the left [right] of

the ˙c = 0 locus. The direction of ˙c is represented by the vertical arrows in Figure 1.

75

George-Marios Angeletos

• Consider next the direction of ˙k . If c < f (k) − δk [c > f (k) − δk ], then and only then
˙k > 0 [ ˙k < 0]. That is, k increases [decreases] with time whenever (c, k) lies below
[above] the ˙k = 0 locus. The direction of ˙k is represented by the horizontal arrows in

Figure 1.

• We can now draw the time path of {kt , ct} starting from any arbitrary (k0 , c0 ), as in
Figure 1. Note that there are only two such paths that go through the steady state.

The one with positive slope represents the stable manifold or saddle path. The other

corresponds to the unstable manifold.

• The equilibrium path of the economy for any initial k0 is given by the stable manifold.
That is, for any given k0 , the equilibrium c0 is the one that puts the economy on the
saddle path.

• To understand why the saddle path is the optimal path when the horizon is inﬁnite,
note the following:

— Any c0 that puts the economy above the saddle path leads to zero capital and
zero consumption in ﬁnite time, thus violating the Euler condition at that time.

Of course, if the horizon was ﬁnite, such a path would have been the equilibrium

path. But with inﬁnite horizon it is better to consume less and invest more in

period 0, so as to never be forced to consume zero at ﬁnite time.

— On the other hand, any c0 that puts the economy below the saddle path leads
to so much capital accumulation in the limit that the transversality condition

is violated. Actually, in ﬁnite time the economy has cross the golden-rule and

will henceforth become dynamically ineﬃcient. One the economy reaches kgold ,
where f 0 (kgold ) − δ = 0, continuing on the path is dominated by an alternative
76

Lecture Notes

feasible path, namely that of investing nothing in new capital and consuming
c = f (kgold) − δkgold thereafter. In other words, the economy is wasting too much
resources in investment and it would better increase consumption.

• Let the function c(k) represent the saddle path. In terms of dynamic programming,
c(k) is simply the optimal policy rule for consumption given capital k . Equivalently,

the optimal policy rule for capital accumulation is given by

˙k = f (k) − δk − c(k),

or in discrete time

kt+1 ≈ G(kt ) ≡ f (kt ) + (1 − δ)kt − c(kt ).

• Finally, note that, no matter what is the form of U (c), you could also write the dynamics
in terms of k and λ:

˙λt
= f 0 (kt ) − δ − ρ
λt
˙kt = f (kt ) − δkt − c(λt ),

where c(λ) solves Uc(c) = λ, that is, c(λ) ≡ U −1
c (λ). Note that Ucc < 0 implies c0 (λ) < 0.
As an exercise, you can draw the phase diagram and analyze the dynamics in terms of

k and λ.

3.5 Comparative Statics and Impulse Responses

3.5.1 Additive Endowment (Figure 2)

• Suppose that each household receives an endowment e > 0 from God. Then, the
household budget is

t + (1 − δ)k j
t+1 = wt + rtk j
t + k j
cj
t + e
Optimal consumption growth is thus given again by

Uc (cj
t )
Uc (cj
t+1 )

= β [1 + rt+1 − δ ]

which together with rt = f 0 (kt ) implies

= {β [1 + f 0 (kt+1 ) − δ ]}θ
On the other hand, adding up the budget across households gives the resource con-

ct+1
ct

straint of the economy

kt+1 − kt = f (kt ) − δkt − ct + e
• We conclude that the phase diagram becomes
˙ct
= θ[f 0 (kt ) − δ − ρ],
ct
˙kt = f (kt ) − δkt − ct + e.

• In the steady state, k∗ is independent of e and c∗ moves one to one with e.
• Consider a permanent increase in e by ∆e. This leads to a parallel shift in the ˙k = 0
locus, but no change in the ˙c = 0 locus. If the economy was initially at the steady

state, then k stays constant and c simply jumps by exactly e. On the other hand, if the

78

Lecture Notes

economy was below the steady state, c will initially increase but by less that e, so that

both the level and the rate of consumption growth will increase along the transition.
See Figure 2.

3.5.2 Taxation and Redistribution (Figures 3 and 4)

• Suppose that labor and capital income are taxed at a ﬂat tax rate τ ∈ (0, 1). The
government redistributes the proceeds from this tax uniformly across households. Let

Tt be the transfer in period t. Then, the household budget is

t ) + (1 − δ)k j
t+1 = (1 − τ )(wt + rtk j
t + k j
cj
t + Tt ,

implying

Uc (cj
t )
= β [1 + (1 − τ )rt+1 − δ ].
Uc(cj
t+1)
That is, the tax rate decreases the private return to investment. Combining with

rt = f 0 (kt ) we infer

ct+1
= {β [1 + (1 − τ )f 0 (kt+1 ) − δ ]}θ .
ct
Adding up the budgets across household gives

ct + kt+1 = (1 − τ )f (kt+1 ) + (1 − δ)kt + Tt
The government budget on the other hand is
Tt = τ Zj
Combining we get the resource constraint of the economy:

(wt + rtk j
t ) = τ f (kt )

kt+1 − kt = f (kt) − δkt − ct
Observe that, of course, the tax scheme does not appear in the resource constraint of

the economy, for it is only redistributive and does not absorb resources.

79

George-Marios Angeletos

• We conclude that the phase diagram becomes
˙ct
= θ[(1 − τ )f 0 (kt ) − δ − ρ],
ct
˙kt = f (kt) − δkt − ct .

• In the steady state, k∗ and therefore c∗ are decreasing functions of τ .
A. Unanticipated Permanent Tax Cut

• Consider an unanticipated permanent tax cut that is enacted immediately. The ˙k = 0
locus does not change, but the ˙c = 0 locus shifts right. The saddle path thus shifts
right. See Figure 3.

• A permanent tax cut leads to an immediate negative jump in consumption and an
immediate positive jump in investment. Capital slowly increases and converges to a

higher k∗ . Consumption initially is lower, but increases over time, so soon it recovers
and eventually converges to a higher c∗ .

B. Anticipated Permanent Tax Cut

• Consider an permanent tax cut that is (credibly) announced at date 0 to be enacted
at some date bt > 0. The diﬀerence from the previous exercise is that ˙c = 0 locus now
does not change immediately. It remains the same for t < bt and shifts right only for
t > bt. Therefore, the dynamics of c and k will be dictated by the “old” phase diagram
(the one corresponding to high τ ) for t < bt and by the “new” phase diagram (the one
corresponding to low τ ) for t > bt,
• At t = bt and on, the economy must follow the saddle path corresponding to the new
low τ , which will eventually take the economy to the new steady state. For t < bt, the
80

Lecture Notes
economy must follow a path dictated by the old dynamics, but at t = bt the economy
must exactly reach the new saddle path. If that were not the case, the consumption
path would have to jump at date bt, which would violate the Euler condition (and thus
be suboptimal). Therefore, the equilibrium c0 is such that, if the economy follows a
path dictated by the old dynamics, it will reach the new saddle path exactly at t = bt.
See Figure 4.

• Following the announcement, consumption jumps down and continues to fall as long
as the tax cut is not initiated. The economy is building up capital in anticipation

of the tax cut. As soon as the tax cut is enacted, capital continues to increase, but

consumption also starts to increase. The economy then slowly converges to the new

higher steady state.

3.5.3 Productivity Shocks: A prelude to RBC (Figures 5 and 6)

• We now consider the eﬀect of a shock in total factor productivity (TFP). The reaction of
the economy in our deterministic framework is similar to the impulse responses we get

in a stochastic Real Business Cycle (RBC) model. Note, however, that here we consider

the case that labor supply is exogenously ﬁxed. The reaction of the economy will be

somewhat diﬀerent with endogenous labor supply, whether we are in the deterministic

or the stochastic case.

• Let output be given by

yt = Atf (kt )

81

George-Marios Angeletos

where At denotes TFP. Note that

rt = Atf 0 (kt )
wt = At [f (kt) − f 0 (kt)kt ]
so that both the return to capital and the wage rate are proportional to TFP.

• We can then write the dynamics as
˙ct
= θ[Atf 0 (kt ) − δ − ρ],
ct
˙kt = Atf (kt ) − δkt − ct .
Note that TFP At aﬀects both the production possibilities frontier of the economy (the
resource constrain) and the incentives to accumulate capital (the Euler condition).

• In the steady state, both k∗ and c∗ are increasing in A.
A. Unanticipated Permanent Productivity Shock

• The ˙k = 0 locus shifts up and the ˙c = 0 locus shifts right, permanently.
• c0 may either increase or fall, depending on whether wealth or substitution eﬀect
dominates. Along the transition, both c and k are increasing towards the new higher
steady state. See Figure 5 for the dynamics.

B. Unanticipated Transitory Productivity Shock
• The ˙k = 0 locus shifts up and the ˙c = 0 locus shifts right, but only for t ∈ [0, bt] for
some ﬁnite bt.
• Again, c0 may either increase or fall, depending on whether wealth or substitution
eﬀects dominates. I consider the case that c0 increases. A typical transition is depicted
in Figure 6.

3.5.4 Government Spending (Figure 7 and 8)

• We now introduce a government that collects taxes in order to ﬁnance some exogenous
level of government spending.

A. Lump Sum Taxation

• Suppose the government ﬁnances its expenditure with lump-sum taxes. The household
budget is

t + (1 − δ)k j
t+1 = wt + rtk j
t + k j
cj
t − Tt ,

implying

Uc(cj
t )
= β [1 + rt+1 − δ ] = β [1 + f 0 (kt+1) − δ ]
Uc (cj
t+1 )
That is, taxes do not aﬀect the savings choice. On the other hand, the government

budget is

Tt = gt ,

where gt denotes government spending. The resource constraint of the economy be-
comes

• We conclude

ct + gt + kt+1 = f (kt ) + (1 − δ)kt

˙ct
= θ[f 0 (kt ) − δ − ρ],
ct
˙kt = f (kt ) − δkt − ct − gt

• In the steady state, k∗ is independent of g and c∗ moves one-to-one with −g . Along
the transition, a permanent increase in g both decreases c and slows down capital
accumulation. See Figure 7.

• Note that the eﬀect of government spending ﬁnanced with lump-sum taxes is isomor-
phic to a negative endowment shock.

B. Distortionary Taxation

• Suppose the government ﬁnances its expenditure with distortionary income taxation.
The household budget is

t ) + (1 − δ)k j
t+1 = (1 − τ )(wt + rtk j
t + k j
cj
t ,

implying

Uc (cj
t )
= β [1 + (1 − τ )rt+1 − δ ] = β [1 + (1 − τ )f 0 (kt+1 ) − δ ].
Uc(cj
t+1)
That is, taxes now distort the savings choice. On the other hand, the government

budget is

and the resource constraint of the economy is again

gt = τ f (kt )

ct + gt + kt+1 = f (kt ) + (1 − δ)kt .

• We conclude

˙ct
= θ[(1 − τ )f 0 (kt ) − δ − ρ],
ct
˙kt = (1 − τ )f (kt) − δkt − ct .
Government spending is now isomorphic to a negative TFP change.

• In the steady state, k∗ is a decreasing function of g (equivalently, τ ) and c∗ decreases
more than one-to-one with g . Along the transition, a permanent increase in g (and τ )
drastically slows down capital accumulation. The immediate See Figure 7.

• Note that the eﬀect of government spending ﬁnanced with distortionary taxes is iso-
morphic to a negative TFP shock.

3.6 Endogenous Labor Supply, the RBC Propagation

Mechanism, and Beyond

3.6.1 The Phase Diagram with Endogenous Labor Supply

• Solve for labor supply as a function of k and c :
Ux (ct , 1 − lt )
= FL(kt , lt ) ⇒ lt = l(kt , ct )
Uc (ct , 1 − lt)
Note that l increases with k , but less than one-to-one (or otherwise FL would fall).
This reﬂects the substitution eﬀect. On the other hand, l falls with c, reﬂecting the

wealth eﬀect.

• Substitute back into the dynamic system for k and c, assuming CEIS preferences:
˙ct
= θ[f 0 (kt/l(kt , ct )) − δ − ρ],
ct
˙kt = f (kt , l(kt , ct )) − δkt − ct ,
which gives a system in kt and ct alone.

• Draw suggestive phase diagram. See Figure ??.
• Note that the ˙c is now negatively sloped, not vertical as in the model with exogenously
ﬁxed labor. This reﬂects the wealth eﬀect on labor supply. Lower c corresponds to

lower eﬀective wealth, which results to higher labor supply for any given k (that is, for

any given wage).

3.6.2 Impulse Responces Revisited

• Note that the endogeneity of labor supply makes the Euler condition (the ˙c locus)
sensitive to wealth eﬀects, but also mitigates the impact of wealth eﬀects on the resource
constraint (the ˙k locus).

• Reconsider the impulse responces of the economy to shocks in productivity or governe-
ment spending.

• Government spending....
negative wealth eﬀect, which increases labor supply. This in turn leads an increase in

If ﬁnanced with lump sum taxes, an increase in g has a

the MPK and stimulates more investment. At the new steady state the capital-labor

ratio remains the same, as it is simply the one that equates the MPK with the discount

rate, but both employment and the stock of capital go up...

• Note that the above is the supply-side eﬀect of government spending. Contrast this
with the demand-side eﬀect in Keynesian models (e.g., IS-LM).

• Productivity shocks....

3.6.3 The RBC Propagation Mechanism, and Beyond

• Just as we can use the model to “explain” the variation of income and productivity
levels in the cross-section of countries (i.e., do the Mankiw-Romer-Weil exercise), we

can also use the model to “explain” the variation of income, productivity, investment

and employment in the time-series of any given country. Hence, the RBC paradigm.

• The heart of the RBC propagation mechanism is the interaction of consumption
smoothing and deminishing returns to capital accumulation. Explain....

Lecture Notes

• This mechanism generates endogenous persistence and ampliﬁcation. Explain...
• Enogenous persistence is indeed the other face of conditional convergence. But just as
the model fails to generate a substantially low rate of conditional convergence, it also

fails to generate either substantial persistence or substantial ampliﬁcation. For the

model to match the data, we then need to assume that exogenous productivity (the

Solow residual) is itself very volatile and persistent. But then we partly answer and

partly peg the question.

• Hence the search for other endogenous propagation mechanisms.
• Discuss Keynesian models and monopolistic competition... Discuss the potential role
ﬁnancial markets...
