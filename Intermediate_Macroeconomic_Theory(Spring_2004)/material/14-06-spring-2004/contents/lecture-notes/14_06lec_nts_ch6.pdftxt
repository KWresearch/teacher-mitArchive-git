Endogenous Growth I: AK, H, and G

6.1 The Simple AK Model

6.1.1 Pareto Allocations

• Total output in the economy is given by

Yt = F (Kt , Lt) = AKt ,

where A > 0 is an exogenous parameter. In intensive form,

yt = f (kt ) = Akt .

• The social planner’s problem is the same as in the Ramsey model, except for the fact
that output is linear in capital:
∞Xt=0
ct + kt+1 ≤ f (kt ) + (1 − δ)kt
113

u(ct )

max

s.t.

George-Marios Angeletos

• The Euler condition gives

u0 (ct )
u0 (ct+1 )
Assuming CEIS, this reduces to

= β (1 + A − δ)

ct+1
ct

= [β (1 + A − δ)]θ

or

ln ct+1 − ln ct ≈ θ(R − ρ)
where R = A − δ is the net social return on capital. That is, consumption growth
is proportional to the diﬀerence between the real return on capital and the discount

rate. Note that now the real return is a constant, rather than diminishing with capital

accumulation.

• Note that the resource constraint can be rewritten as

ct + kt+1 = (1 + A − δ)kt .

Since total resources (the RHS) are linear in k , an educated guess is that optimal

consumption and investment are also linear in k . We thus propose

ct = (1 − s)(1 + A − δ)kt
kt+1 = s(1 + A − δ)kt
where the coeﬃcient s is to be determined and must satisfy s ∈ (0, 1) for the solution
to exist.

• It follows that

ct+1
ct

=

kt+1
kt

yt+1

114

so that consumption, capital and income all grow at the same rate. To ensure perpetual

growth, we thus need to impose

β (1 + A − δ) > 1,
or equivalently A − δ > ρ. If that condition were not satisﬁed, and instead A − δ < ρ,
then the economy would shrink at a constant rate towards zero.

• From the resource constraint we then have
kt+1
ct
kt
kt

+

= (1 + A − δ),

implying that the consumption-capital ratio is given by

ct
= (1 + A − δ) − [β (1 + A − δ)]θ
kt
Using ct = (1 − s)(1 + A − δ)kt and solving for s we conclude that the optimal saving
rate is

s = β θ (1 + A − δ)θ−1 .
Equivalently, s = β θ (1 + R)θ−1 , where R = A − δ is the net social return on capital.
Note that the saving rate is increasing (decreasing) in the real return if and only if the
EIS is higher (lower) than unit, and s = β for θ = 1. Finally, to ensure s ∈ (0, 1), we
impose

β θ (1 + A − δ)θ−1 < 1.
This is automatically ensured when θ ≤ 1 and β (1 + A − δ) > 1, as then s =
β θ (1 + A − δ)θ−1 ≤ β < 1. But when θ > 1, this puts an upper bound on A.
If
A exceeded that upper bound, then the social planner could attain inﬁnite utility, and

the problem is not well-deﬁned.

• We conclude that

Proposition 24 Consider the social planner’s problem with linear technology f (k) = Ak
and CEIS preferences. Suppose (β , θ, A, δ ) satisfy β (1 + A − δ) > 1 > β θ (1 + A − δ)θ−1 .
Then, the economy exhibits a balanced growth path. Capital, output, and consumption al l

grow at a constant rate given by

= [β (1 + A − δ)]θ > 1.
while the investment rate out of total resources is given by

=

=

ct+1
ct

kt+1
kt

yt+1
yt

s = β θ (1 + A − δ)θ−1 .
The growth rate is increasing in productivity A, increasing in the elasticity of intertemporal
substitution θ , and decreasing in the discount rate ρ (where β = 1
1+ρ ).

• Diﬀerences in productivities and preferences may thus help explain diﬀerences, not
only in the level of output and the rate of investment, but also in growth rates.

6.1.2 The Frictionless Competitive Economy

• Consider now how the social planner’s allocation is decentralized in a competitive
market economy.

• Suppose that the same technology that is available to the social planner is available to
each single ﬁrm in the economy. Then, the equilibrium rental rate of capital and the

equilibrium wage rate will be given simply

r = A and w = 0.

116

Lecture Notes

• The arbitrage condition between bonds and capital will imply that the interest rate is

R = r − δ = A − δ .

• Finally, the Euler condition for the household will give
ct+1
= [β (1 + R)]θ .
ct

• We conclude that the competitive market allocations coincide with the Pareto optimal
plan. Note that this is true only because the private and the social return to capital

coincide.

6.1.3 What is next

• The analysis here has assumed a single type of capital and a single sector of produc-
tion. We next consider multiple types of capital and multiple sectors. In essence, we

“endogenize” the capital K and the productivity A — for example, in terms of physical

versus human capital, intentional capital accumulation versus unintensional spillovers,

innovation and knowledge creation, etc. The level of productivity and the growth rate

will then depend how the economy allocates resources across diﬀerent types of capital

and diﬀerent sectors of production. What is important to keep in mind from the simple

AK model is the importance of linear returns for delivering perpetual growth.

6.2 A Simple Model of Human Capital

• We now consider a variant of the AK model, where there are two types of capital,
physical (or tangible) and human (or intangible). We start by assuming that both

117

George-Marios Angeletos

types of capital are produced with the same technology, that is, the absorb resources

in the same intensities. We later consider the case that the production of human capital

is more intensive in time/eﬀort/skills than in machines/factories.

6.2.1 Pareto Allocations

• Total output in the economy is given by

Yt = F (Kt , Ht ) = F (Kt , htLt ),

where F is a neoclassical production function, Kt is aggregate capital in period t, ht
is human capital per worker, and Ht = htLt is eﬀective labor.

• Note that, due to CRS, we can rewrite output per capita as
, 1¶ ht
yt = F (kt , ht) = F µ kt
ht
kt + ht

[kt + ht ] =

or equivalently

yt = F (kt , ht ) = A (κt ) [kt + ht ],

where κt = kt/ht = Kt/Ht is the ratio of physical to human capital, kt + ht measures
total capital, and

A (κ) ≡
represents the return to total capital.

F (κ, 1)
1 + κ ≡

f (κ)
1 + κ

• Total output can be used for consumption or investment in either type of capital, so
that the resource constraint of the economy is given by

ct + ik
t + ih
t ≤ yt .

118

Lecture Notes

The laws of motion for two types of capital are

kt+1 = (1 − δk )kt + ik
t
ht+1 = (1 − δh )ht + ih
t
As long as neither ik
t nor ih
t are constrained to be positive, the resource constraint and
the two laws of motion are equivalent to a single constraint, namely

ct + kt+1 + ht+1 ≤ F (kt , ht ) + (1 − δk )kt + (1 − δh )ht
• The social planner’s problem thus becomes
∞Xt=0
max
ct + kt+1 + ht+1 ≤ F (kt , ht ) + (1 − δk )kt + (1 − δh )ht
• Since there are two types of capital, we have two Euler conditions, one for each type
of capital. The one for physical capital is
u0 (ct )
= β [1 + Fk (kt+1 , ht+1) − δk ] ,
u0 (ct+1)
while the one for human capital is

u(ct )

s.t.

u0 (ct )
= β [1 + Fh (kt+1 , ht+1) − δh ] .
u0 (ct+1 )
• Combining the two Euler condition, we infer
Fk (kt+1 , ht+1) − δk = Fh (kt+1 , ht+1) − δh .
Remember that F is CRS, implying that both Fk and Fh are functions of the ratio
κt+1 = kt+1/ht+1 . In particular, Fk is decreasing in κ and Fh is increasing in κ. The
above condition therefore determines a unique optimal ratio κ∗ such that

kt+1
ht+1

= κt+1 = κ∗

119

George-Marios Angeletos

for all t ≥ 0. For example, if F (k , h) = kαh1−α and δk = δh , then Fk
k and
h
= α
1−α
Fh
1−α . More generally, the optimal physical-to-human capital ratio is
therefore κ∗ = α
increasing in the relative productivity of physical capital and decreasing in the relative

depreciation rate of physical capital.

• Multiplying the Euler condition for k with kt+1/(kt+1 + ht+1) and the one for h with
ht+1/(kt+1 + ht+1 ), and summing the two together, we infer the following “weighted”
Euler condition:
= β ½1 +
By CRS, we have

kt+1 [Fk (kt+1 , ht+1) − δk ] + ht+1 [Fh (kt+1 , ht+1) − δh ]
kt+1 + ht+1

u0 (ct+1)

¾

Fk (kt+1 , ht+1)kt+1 + Fh (kt+1 , ht+1)ht+1 = F (kt+1 , ht+1) = A (κt+1) [kt+1 + ht+1 ]

It follows that

= β ½1 + A (κt+1 ) −
u0 (ct )
u0 (ct+1)
Using the fact that κt+1 = κ∗ , and letting

kt+1 + ht+1 ¾
δk kt+1 + δhht+1

A∗ ≡ A (κ∗) ≡
represent the “eﬀective” return to total capital and

F (κ∗ , 1)
1 + κ∗

δ ∗ ≡ δ (κ∗) ≡
the “eﬀective” depreciation rate of total capital, we conclude that the “weighted” Euler

condition evaluated at the optimal physical-to-human capital ratio is

u0 (ct)
u0 (ct+1)

= β [1 + A∗ − δ ∗ ] .

120

Lecture Notes

• Assuming constant elasticity of intertemporal substitution, namely u(c) = c1−1/θ
1−1/θ , this
reduces to

ct+1
ct

= [β (1 + A∗ − δ ∗)]θ

or

ln ct+1 − ln ct ≈ θ(A∗ − δ ∗ − ρ)
where A∗ − δ ∗ is the net social return to total savings. Note that the return is constant
along the balanced growth path, but it is not exogenous. It instead depends on the ratio

of physical to human capital. The latter is determined optimally so as to maximize

the net return on total savings. To see this, note that kt+1/ht+1 = κ∗ indeed solves the
following problem

max F (kt+1 , ht+1) − δkkt+1 − δhht+1
s.t. kt+1 + ht+1 = constant

Equivalently, κ∗ maximizes the return to savings:

κ∗ = arg max
κ

[1 + A(κ) − δ(κ)]

• Given the optimal ratio κ∗ , the resource constraint can be rewritten as
ct + [kt+1 + ht+1 ] = (1 + A∗ − δ ∗ )[kt + ht ].
Like in the simple Ak model, an educated guess is then that optimal consumption and

total investment are also linear in total capital:

ct = (1 − s)(1 + A∗ − δ ∗ )[kt + ht ],
kt+1 + ht+1 = s(1 + A∗ − δ ∗ )[kt + ht ].

121

George-Marios Angeletos

The optimal saving rate s is given by

s = β θ (1 + A∗ − δ ∗)θ−1 .

• We conclude that

Proposition 25 Consider the social planner’s problem with CRS technology F (k , h) over

physical and human capital and CEIS preferences. Let

A(κ) ≡

F (κ, 1)
1 + κ

and

δ(κ) ≡

κ
1 + κ

δk +

1 + κ

δh .

Next, let

κ∗ = arg max
[1 + A(κ) − δ(κ)]
κ
and suppose (β , θ, F , δ k , δh) satisfy β [1 + A(κ∗) − δ(κ∗)] > 1 > β θ [1 + A(κ∗ ) − δ(κ∗)]θ−1 .
Then, the economy exhibits a balanced growth path. Physical capital, human capital, output,

and consumption al l grow at a constant rate given by

=

ct+1
= {β [1 + A(κ∗) − δ(κ∗)]}θ > 1.
yt
ct
while the investment rate out of total resources is given by s = β θ [1 + A(κ∗) − δ(κ∗)]θ−1 and
the optimal ratio of physical to human capital is kt+1/ht+1 = κ∗ . The growth rate is increas-
ing in the productivity of either type of capital, increasing in the elasticity of intertemporal

substitution, and decreasing in the discount rate.

6.2.2 Market Allocations

• Consider now how the social planner’s allocation is decentralized in a competitive
market economy.

122

Lecture Notes

• The household budget is given by
t + ih
ct + ik
t + bt+1 ≤ yt + (1 + Rt )bt .

and the laws of motion for the two types of capital are

kt+1 = (1 − δk )kt + ik
t
ht+1 = (1 − δh )ht + ih
t
We can thus write the household budget as

ct + kt+1 + ht+1 + bt+1 ≤ (1 + rt − δk )kt + (1 + wt − δh )ht + (1 + Rt )bt .
Note that rt − δk and wt − δh represent the market returns to physical and human
capital, respectively.

• Suppose that the same technology that is available to the social planner is available to
each single ﬁrm in the economy. Then, the equilibrium rental rate of capital and the

equilibrium wage rate will be given simply

rt = Fk (κt , 1)

and wt = Fh(κt , 1),

where κt = kt/ht .

• The arbitrage condition between bonds and the two types of capital imply that

Rt = rt − δk = wt − δh .

Combining the above with the ﬁrms’ FOC, we infer

Fk (κt , 1)
Fh (κt , 1)

=

rt
wt

=

δh
δk

123

George-Marios Angeletos

and therefore κt = κ∗ , like in the Pareto optimum. It follows then that

Rt = A∗ − δ ∗ ,
where A∗ = A(κ∗) and δ ∗ = δ(κ∗), as above.

• Finally, the Euler condition for the household is
u0 (ct )
= β (1 + Rt ) .
u0 (ct+1 )
Using Rt = A∗ − δ ∗ , we conclude
ct+1
yt+1
= [β (1 + A∗ − δ ∗ )]θ
=
yt
ct
• Hence, the competitive market allocations once again coincide with the Pareto optimal
plan. Note that again this is true only because the private and the social return to

each type of capital coincide.

6.3 Learning by Education (Ozawa and Lucas)

• The beneﬁt of accumulating human capital is that it increases labor productivity. The
cost of accumulating human capital is that it absorbs resources that could be used in

the production of consumption goods or physical capital.

• The previous analysis assumed that human capital is produced with the same technol-
ogy as consumption goods and physical capital. Perhaps a more realistic assumption

is that the production of human capital is relative intensive in time and eﬀort. Indeed,

we can think of formal education as a choice between how much time to allocate to

work (production) and how much to learning (education).

6.4 Learning by Doing and Knowledge Spillovers (Ar-

row and Romer)

6.4.1 Market Allocations

• Output for ﬁrm m is given by

t , htLm
t = F (K m
Y m
t )

where ht represents the aggregate level of human capital or knowledge. ht is endoge-
nously determined in the economy (we will specify in a moment how), but it is taken

as exogenous from either ﬁrms or households.

• Firm proﬁts are given by
t − wtLm
t ) − rtK m
t , htLm
t = F (K m
Πm
t

The FOCs give

t , htLm
rt = FK (K m
t )

t , htLm
wt = FL (K m
t ) ht

Using the market clearing conditions for physical capital and labor, we infer K m
t /Lm
t =
kt , where kt is the aggregate capital labor ratio in the economy. We conclude that,
given kt and ht , market prices are given by

rt = FK (kt , ht ) = f 0 (κt )
wt = FL(kt , ht )ht = [f (κt) − f 0 (κt )κt ]ht
where f (κ) ≡ F (κ, 1) is the production function in intensive form and κt = kt/ht .
125

George-Marios Angeletos

• Households, like ﬁrms, take wt , rt and ht as exogenously given. The representative
household maximizes utility sub ject to the budget constraint

ct + kt+1 + bt+1 ≤ wt + (1 + rt − δ)kt + (1 + Rt )bt .
Arbitrage between bonds and capital imply Rt = rt − δ and the Euler condition gives
u0 (ct )
= β (1 + Rt ) = β (1 + rt − δ).
u0 (ct+1 )
• To close the model, we need to specify how ht is determined. Following Arrow and
Romer, we assume that knowledge accumulation is the unintentional by-product of

learning-by-doing in production. We thus let the level of knowledge to be proportional

to either the level of output, or the level of capital:

for some constant η > 0.

ht = ηkt ,

• It follows that the ratio kt/ht = κt is pinned down by κt = 1/η . Letting the constants
A and ω be deﬁned

A ≡ f 0 (1/η ) and ω ≡ f (1/η)η − f 0 (1/η ),
we infer that equilibrium prices are given by

rt = A and wt = ωkt .

Substituting into the Euler condition gives

u0 (ct )
= β (1 + A − δ) .
u0 (ct+1 )
Finally, it is immediate that capital and output grow at the same rate as consumption.

We conclude

126

Lecture Notes

Proposition 26 Let A ≡ f 0 (1/η ) and ω ≡ f (1/η)η − f 0 (1/η ), and suppose β (1 + A − δ) >
1 > β θ (1 + A − δ)θ−1 . Then, the market economy exhibits a balanced growth path. Physical
capital, know ledge, output, wages, and consumption al l grow at a constant rate given by

yt+1
yt

ct+1
ct

=

= [β (1 + A − δ)]θ > 1.
The wage rate is given by wt = ωkt , while the investment rate out of total resources is given
by s = β θ (1 + A − δ)θ−1 .

6.4.2 Pareto Allocations and Policy Implications

• Consider now the Pareto optimal allocations. The social planner recognizes that knowl-
edge in the economy is proportional to physical capital and internalizes the eﬀect of

learning-by-doing. He thus understands that output is given by

yt = F (kt , ht) = A∗kt

where A∗ ≡ f (1/η )η = A + ω represents the social return on capital. It is therefore
as if the social planner had access to a linear technology like in the simple Ak model,

and therefore the Euler condition for the social planner is given by

u0 (ct )
u0 (ct+1)

= β (1 + A∗ − δ) .

• Note that the social return to capital is higher than the private (market) return to
capital:

A∗ > A = rt

The diﬀerence is actually ω , the fraction of the social return on savings that is “wasted”

as labor income.

127

George-Marios Angeletos

Proposition 27 Let A∗ ≡ A+ω ≡ f (1/η )η and suppose β (1 + A∗ − δ) > 1 > β θ (1 + A∗ − δ)θ−1 .
Then, the Pareto optimal plan exhibits a balanced growth path. Physical capital, know ledge,

output, wages, and consumption al l grow at a constant rate given by

yt+1
yt

ct+1
ct

= [β (1 + A∗ − δ)]θ > 1.
Note that A < A∗ , and therefore the market growth rate is lower than the Pareto optimal
one.

• Exercise: Reconsider the market allocation and suppose the government intervenes by
subsidizing either private savings or ﬁrm investment. Find, in each case, what is the

subsidy that implements the optimal growth rate. Is this subsidy the optimal one, in

the sense that it maximizes social welfare?
