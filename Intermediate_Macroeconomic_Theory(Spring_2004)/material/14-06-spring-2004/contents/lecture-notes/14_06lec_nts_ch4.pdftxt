4.1 Consumption Smoothing

4.1.1 The Intertemporal Budget

• For any given sequence of interest rates {Rt}∞t=0 , pick an arbitrary q0 > 0 and deﬁne
qt recursively by

that is,

qt =

qt−1
1 + Rt

,

qt =

q0
(1 + R1 )...(1 + Rt )
qt represents the price of period−t consumption relative to period−0 consumption.
• The buget in period t is given by

.

ct + at+1 ≤ (1 + Rt )at + yt

where at denotes assets and yt denotes labor income.

89

George-Marios Angeletos

qt (1 + Rt )at = q0 (1 + R0)a0 +

• Multiplying the period-t budget by qt and adding up over all t, we get
TXt=0
TXt=0
[qt (1 + Rt )at + qtyt ] .
[qt ct + qtat+1 ] ≤
Using the fact that qt (1 + Rt) = qt−1 , we have
TXt=0
TXt=1
so that the above reduces to
TXt=0
TXt=1
• Assuming either that the agent dies at ﬁnite time without leaving any bequests, in
which case aT +1 = 0, or that the time is inﬁnite, in which case we impose qT aT +1 → 0
as T → ∞, we conclude that the intertemporal budget constraint is given by
TXt=0
TXt=1
qtyt ,
qt ct ≤ q0 (1 + R0)a0 +
where T < ∞ (ﬁnite horizon) or T = ∞ (inﬁnite horiozon). The interpretation is
simple: The present value of the consumption the agent enjoys from period 0 and on

qt ct + qT aT +1 ≤ q0 (1 + R0)a0 +

qt−1at

qtyt

can not exceed the value of initial assets the agent has in period 0 plus the present

value of the labor income the agent receives from period 0 and on.

• We can rewrite the intertemporal budget as
TXt=0
qt ct ≤ q0x0

where

x0 ≡ (1 + R0)a0 + h0 ,

h0 ≡

Lecture Notes

(1 + R0)a0 is the household’s ﬁnancial wealth as of period 0. h0 is the present value of
labor income as of period 0; we often call h0 the household’s human wealth as of period
0. The sum x0 ≡ (1 + R0)a0 + h0 represents the household’s eﬀective wealth.
• Note that the sequence of per-period budgets and the intertemporal budget constraint
are equivalent. We can then write the household’s consumption problem as follows
TXt=0
max
TXt=0
qtct ≤ q0x0
• Note that the above is like a “static” consumption problem: Interpret ct as diﬀerent
consumption goods and qt as the price of these goods. This observation relates to the
context of Arrow-Debreu markets that we discuss later.

4.1.2 Consumption Smoothing

• The Lagrangian for the household’s problem is
β tU (ct) + λ "q0x0 −

TXt=0
TXt=0
L =
where λ is the shadow cost of resources for the consumer (that is, the Lagrange mul-
tiplier for the intertemporal budget constraint).

• The FOCs give

for period 0 and similarly

for any period t.

U 0 (c0) = λq0

β tU 0 (ct) = λqt

• Suppose for a moment that the interest rate equals the discount rate in all periods:

Equivalently,

The FOCs then reduce to

for all t, and therefore

Rt = ρ ≡ 1/β − 1.

qt = β t q0

U 0 (ct) = λq0

ct = c.

for all t. That is, the level of consumption is the same in all periods.

q0x0 =

qt ct =

q0c

• But how is the value of c determined? From the intertemporal budget, using qt = β tq0
and ct = c, we infer
TXt=0
c = (1 − β )x0 = (1 − β ) [(1 + R0)a0 + h0 ]
That is, the household consumes a fraction of his initial eﬀective wealth. This fraction
is given by 1 − β .

• Let q(st) be the period-0 price of a unite of the consumable in period t and event st
and w(st) the period-t wage rate in terms of period-t consumables for a given event st .

q(st)w(st ) is then the period-t and event-st wage rate in terms of period-0 consunam-

bles. We can then write household’s consumption problem as follows
max Xt Xst

household’s eﬀective wealth.

4.2.2 The Consumption Problem with CEIS

• Suppose for a moment that preferences are separable between consumption and leisure
and are homothetic with respect to consumption:

U (c, z ) = u(c) + v(z).
c1−1/θ
1 − 1/θ

u(c) =

George-Marios Angeletos

• Letting µ be the Lagrange multiplier for the intertemporal budget constraint, the FOCs
imply
β tπ(st )u0 ¡cj (st )¢ = µq(st )
for all t ≥ 0. Evaluating this at t = 0, we infer µ = u0 (cj
0). It follows that
= β tπ(st ) µ cj (st )
0 ¶−1/θ
β tπ(st )u0 (cj (st ))
q(st )
u0 (cj

That is, the price of a consumable in period t relative to period 0 equals the marginal

rate of intertemporal substitution between 0 and t.
• Solving qt/q0 = β tπ(st) £cj (st)/cj
0¤−1/θ for cj (st ) gives
0 £β tπ(st )¤θ · q(st )
q0 ¸−θ
cj (st) = cj
It follows that the present value of consumption is given by
∞Xt=0 £β tπ(st )¤θ q(st )1−θ

Substituting into the resource constraint, and solving for c0 , we conclude

wealth as of period 0.

4.2.3 Intertemporal Consumption Smoothing, with No Uncertainty

• Consider for a moment the case that there is no uncertainty, so that cj (st) = cj
t and
q(st) = qt for all st .

• Then, the riskless bond and the Arrow securities satisfy the following arbitrage condi-
tion

qt =

.

Alternatively,

q0
(1 + R0 )(1 + R1)...(1 + Rt )
qt = q0 h1 + eR0,ti−t
where eR0,t represents the “average” interest rate between 0 and t. Next, note that m0
is decreasing (increasing) in qt if and only if θ > 1 (θ < 1). It follows that the marginal
propensity to save in period 0, which is simply 1 − m0 , is decreasing (increasing) in
eR0,t , for any t ≥ 0, if and only if θ > 1 (θ < 1).
• A similar result applies for all t ≥ 0. We conclude
Proposition 22 Suppose preferences are seperable between consumption and leisure and

homothetic in consumption (CEIS). Then, the optimal consumption is linear in contempo-

raneous eﬀective wealth:

George-Marios Angeletos

mt is a decreasing (increasing) function of qτ for any τ ≥ t if and only θ > 1 (θ < 1).
That is, the marginal propensity to save out of eﬀective wealth is increasing (decreasing) in

future interest rates if and only if the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is higher (lower)

than unit. Moreover, for given prices, the optimal consumption path is independent of the

timining of either labor income or taxes.

• Obviously, a similar result holds with uncertainty, as long as there are complete Arrow-
Debreu markets.

• Note that any expected change in income has no eﬀect on consumption as long as
it does not aﬀect the present value of labor income. Also, if there is an innovation

(unexpected change) in income, consumption will increase today and for ever by an

amount proportional to the innovation in the annuity value of labor income.

• To see this more clearly, suppose that the interest rate is constant and equal to the
discount rate: Rt = R = 1/β − 1 for all t. Then, the marginal propensity to consume
is

m = 1 − β θ (1 + R)1−θ = 1 − β ,
the consumption rule in period 0 becomes
0 = m · £(1 + R)a0 + hj
0¤
cj
and the Euler condition reduces to
t = cj
cj
0

Therefore, the consumer choose a totally ﬂat consumption path, no matter what is the

time variation in labor income. And any unexpected change in consumption leads to

a parallel shift in the path of consumption by an amount equal to the annuity value

96

Lecture Notes

of the change in labor income. This is the manifestation of intertemporal consumption

smoothing.

• More generally, if the interest rate is higher (lower) than the discount rate, the path
of consumption is smooth but has a positive (negative) trend. To see this, note that

the Euler condition is

log ct+1 ≈ θ(R − ρ) + log ct .

4.2.4 Incomplete Markets and Self-Insurance

• The above analysis has assumed no uncertainty, or that markets are complete. Ex-
tending the model to introduce idiosyncratic uncertainty in labor income would imply

an Euler condition of the form

t ) = β (1 + R)Etu0 (cj
u0 (cj
t+1 )

Note that, because of the convexity of u0 , as long as V art [cj
t+1 ] > 0, we have Etu0 (cj
t+1 ) >
u0 (Et cj
t+1) and therefore

Et cj
t+1
cj
t

> [β (1 + R)]θ

This extra kick in consumption growth reﬂects the precautionary motive for savings.

It remains true that transitory innovations in income result to persistent changes in

consumption (because of consumption smoothing). At the same time, consumers ﬁnd

it optimal to accumulate a buﬀer stock, as a vehicle for self-insurance.
