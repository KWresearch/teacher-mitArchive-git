Question 1: (The Solow Model in discrete time with technological progress.)
Consider the Solow model that was presented in class but now allow for labor augmenting technological
progress so that:

t (AtLt )1−α
Yt = K α
where labor and technologcal progress grow each period according to

Lt = (1 + n) Lt−1
At = (1 + g) At−1

where L0 and A0 are taken as given.
As before, the evolution of capital is governed by

Kt = (1 − δ) Kt−1 + It .
To complete the model, make Solow’s assumption that a constant fraction s of output is invested.
Chose an appropriate normalization and fully characterize the steady state of the economy. What is the
growth rate of output per worker in the steady state?
