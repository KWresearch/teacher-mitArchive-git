β t ln (Ct )

Question 1: Numerical Dynamic Programming. Submit your code and the requested plots.
Consider the planner’s problem in a basic ramsey model. There is no population growth. The planner’s
ob jective is to maximize
∞Xt=0
Kt+1 = (1 − δ) Kt + It
and the resource constraint of the economy requires that

capital evolves according to

(1)

Ct + It ≤ Yt = K α
t
You can assume (without loss of generality) that the resource constraint will always bind with equality in
the planner’s solution. Our task is to use the method of numerical dynamic programming to characterize
the planner’s solution to this problem. Observe that Kt is the state variable and the control variables are
Ct and It . The bellman equaltion can then be written as

(2)

V (Kt ) = max
Ct ,It {ln (Ct ) + βV (Kt+1 )}

(3)

sub ject to (1) and (2).
Use the following paramater values:

a) First, show (on paper) that the bellman equation can be written as

α = 0.33, β = 0.95, δ = 0.05

Kt+1 {ln ((1 − δ) Kt + K α
V (Kt ) = max
t − Kt+1 ) + βV (Kt+1 )} .
b) Using numerical dynamic programming, solve for the value function. You are looking to ﬁnd a vector
of values which give the value of V at diﬀerent levels of Kt . Plot and print the value function (make sure
you plot V against Kt ). HINTS: Solve this by understanding and editing the example MATLAB code that
I have posted on the Pset page. Now the state variable is capital instead of wealth. The range of the state
variable should be strictly positive (pick the minimum to be very slightly above zero to avoid ﬁnding the
origin as a solution). The most important thing that you need to change is the line where I evaluate the
value function since the resource constraints here are diﬀerent to those for the consumer’s problem. Start
with a coarse grid then when you have the program working run it with a ﬁner grid.
c) Plot and print the policy function. For the problem, as we have re-formulated it, this means ﬁnding
the function Kt+1 (Kt ). Again make sure you get the axis right.
[HINT: This should be easy since the
code you have is already written calculate a policy function of Wt+1 (Wt ).] Check that the policy function
crosses the 45 degree line - if it does not then you should expand the range over which you evaualte the state
variable. Explain why.
d) From your plot in part c) approximate what the steady state level of capital is.
e) Using the policy function in Kt+1 (Kt ) combined with (1) and (2) ﬁnd the optimal policy functions for
consumption Ct (Kt ) and investment It (Kt ). Using these, approximate the steady state level of consumption
and investment.
f ) If you have made it this far you have already characterized the saddle path of the system! What is
it? Suppose that the discount factor decreases from 0.95 to 0.85. How does this aﬀect the saddle path?
Show this by plotting the two saddle paths and comparing. How does the steady state level of capital and
consumption change? [HINT: answer this by re-running your program with the new paramater value].
