i)  What is the optimal consumption level in each period of life now? 
ii) How much does the individual save in period  t  ? 
iii)  Are the savings positive or negative?  Explain your answer. 
 
(c)  Now suppose that the government decides to tax individuals.  The government 
implements a tax on income in each period of life such that an individual’s income is 
, where

tax and throws it in the ocean. 

i)  How much did the tax reduce the individual’s per-period 
(contemporaneous) income? 
ii)  How much did the tax reduce the individual’s lifetime income? 
iii)  How much does the optimal consumption at time 
t =  fall?

(d)  Now suppose that the government taxes individual’s income in only the last period of 
life when  t

1τ= , in the last period of life, and 
0τ=  in all 
T=
earlier periods.   

 

i)  How much did the tax reduce the individual’s per-period 
(contemporaneous) income in each period? 
ii)  How much did the tax reduce the individual’s lifetime income? 
iii)  How much does the optimal consumption at time 
t =  fall?

(e)  In a few sentences, explain the intuition of why the government taxes in parts (c) and (d) 
have the same affect on consumption at time 
t = .  Be sure to discuss how changes in 
0
contemporaneous income and lifetime (permanent) income each affect consumption.

assume that the individual’s wealth and income stream are such that his or her consumption is 
always in the range where marginal utility is positive.

(a)  Please describe (in a few sentences) what a ‘good’ is in this model of uncertainty. 
(i.e. what will the individual in this economy be optimizing over?)  How does this 
differ from the first question of this problem set, which dealt with a model of 
certainty?  How do the prices, 
, in this economy differ?

(b)  Interpret the lifetime budget constraint I have given you. 
 

i)  What was assumed about the initial assets an individual begins with?   
ii)  Can an individual’s consumption in any one state and time exceed his or 
her income in that state and time? If so, how is this possible? 

(c)  Solve for the FOCs of the individual’s maximization problem. Remember to 
(
)tSπ
account for the probability, 
, of each event occurring when you write out 
the individual’s total expected lifetime utility.    

 
(d)  Now consider two possible states of the world at time 
.  In the first state, which 
t
, the world has been at war for all periods of time up until time  t .  In 
we’ll call 
tW
, the world has been at peace for all periods 
the second state, which we’ll call 
tP
of time up until time 
.  Use your FOCs from earlier to prove the following 
t
condition is true.  Explain the intuition behind this condition.  You will not 
receive credit for this question if you don’t explain the intuition!

(e)  If we assume that the interest rate is constant and equal to the individuals 
(

and  t .  Assume this is true.  
for all 
discount rate, it can be shown that 
S
q S β=

Using your first order conditions from part (c), what can you say about how 
consumption varies across different states of the world?  How is consumption 
smoothing different in this model of ‘uncertainty’ compared to consumption 
smoothing we find in the model of ‘certainty’?
