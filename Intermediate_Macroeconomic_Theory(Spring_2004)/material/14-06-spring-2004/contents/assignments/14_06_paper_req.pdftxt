The deadlines for the paper will be strictly enforced, unless there are extreme 
circumstances.  
 
B. Content: 
 
We are looking for a paper that is 20-25 pages, double-spaced, with a 12pt Times New 
Roman font.  Please do not hand in anything over 30 pages. 
 
The topic of the paper is financial markets and growth.  There is a very large literature on 
how the development of financial markets may affect growth or vice-versa, and how the 
development of an economy and its financial markets are inter-related.  We are looking 
for papers that fit into this general area of research.  For more concrete examples of the 
area of research toward which we are directing you, please see the articles listed at the 
end of this document. 
 
There are 3 types of papers that are possible: 
 

1.  Empirical Analysis 
 

An empirical analysis seeks to test various established theories, or seeks to 
introduce novel concepts, by examining real world data.  An absolute must for an 
empirical analysis is the gathering and examination of a data source.   
 
An empirical paper typically states a theoretical prediction (or several possible 
predictions) and seeks to test the prediction in a real world setting.  For example, 
a common theoretical dilemma is whether the development of financial systems 
cause improved growth, OR whether financial systems simply develop in areas of 
high growth potential.  They key empirical analysis would attempt to discern the 
causal pattern: does an improved financial system cause high growth or does high 
growth lead to an improved financial system? 
 
If you choose an empirical paper, we expect you to review the literature on your 
topic of choice, find new data, and do a new stastical analysis.  While this type of 

analysis may at first seem the most daunting, we hope to make it easier by 
providing you with several possible sources of data.  These are listed below in 
Section E. 

2.  Theoretical Paper 
 
A theory paper seeks to introduce new economic intuition through formal (i.e., 
mathematical) analysis.  Theory papers typically start with basic intuitive 
assumptions and try to show interesting and novel results through the use of a 
model. 
 
A theory paper for this course would typically start with an established theory 
paper in the literature, add variations and try to draw new insights into the 
relationship between financial markets and growth.  We do not expect a full-
blown new model, but we do expect significant variations on existing models that 
offer valuable insight.  A theory paper should explore the relevant existing 
literature, develop an existing model, make significant changes to the model, draw 
new insights, and explore the new predictions of the model. 
 
3.  Mixed empirical and theoretical paper 

• 
Introduction with a main thesis 
•  Background of existing research in your area 
•  Development of the content that supports your thesis 
•  A conclusion 
•  A citation of sources 

 

 

 
 

A mixed paper should rigorously compare and contrast different theories and then 
look to the empirical literature for support.  Simply stating the predictions of 
various models is not sufficient; we expect a detailed formal (i.e., mathematical) 
analysis of the different theories and what drives the different results.  For 
example, what are the different assumptions?  What are the different predictions?  
Which is best supported by the empirical literature? 
 
A mixed paper should be much more comprehensive in its treatment of the 
existing literature and how various theories are supported by the different 
empirical analyses. 

 
Please notice that in all three types of paper, we want more than just a summary of a 
paper or a simple review of the literature. 
 
C. Structure: 
 
While this structure is not rigid, we expect in all papers the following:
