This question is based on the Learning by Doing model discussed in the class notes and 
Romer’s textbook (page 120).  The economy is described as follows:

(a)  Describe how human capital, as given by 
, accumulates in this economy.  Do firms or 
th
individuals directly invest in improving the level of human capital?  Or, is it simply a side 
effect of physical capital accumulation?  Given your answer, do you believe that the 
social planner and decentralized competitive equilibrium will coincide in this model?

a.  What is the growth rate of consumption in the economy?   
b.  What is the optimal savings rate?  (Assume a linear savings function as done 
in the class notes) 

(c)  Solve for the competitive equilibrium in this economy.  (Solve the model in the same 
fashion as done in the first half of the course.  For simplicity, assume that the labor 
supply of individuals is exogenous and equal to 1.  Moreover, assume that the 
borrowing constraint is never binding.)

b.  What is the arbitrage condition between risk-free bonds and capital? 
c.  Use the FOCs of the household to find the Euler condition. 
d.  Using the firm’s profit maximizing behavior, what is the equilibrium 
interest rate for physical capital and the equilibrium wage rate?  
(Remember, the firm takes human capital as exogenous). 
e.  What is the growth rate of consumption? 

 
(d)  Compare the growth rate of the social planner’s equilibrium from Part (b) to that of the 
decentralized equilibrium in Part (c).  How are they different, and why?

(e)  Now suppose that the government subsidizes the private cost of capital for firms.  In 
particular, assume that the private cost of capital for firms is now given by  (
and 
)

the government pays for this subsidy via lump sum taxes,  T , on individuals.  Resolve 
for the competitive equilibrium of this economy. 

 

a.  What is the subsidy, τ , the government should set such that the 
competitive equilibrium growth rate of consumption coincides with 
the social planner’s outcome we found in Part (a)? 
b.  Why does the government want to subsidize investment in this model? 

2.  Taxes in the Human Capital  Model 

This question will add taxes to the human capital model discussed in the notes.  
Specifically, assume the following conditions for the economy:

(a)  What must I assume about the variables αand  β in order to have constant 
returns to scale (CRS) for physical capital and human capital?  Why do we want 
to make this type of assumption? 

For the remainder of this question, assume CRS as done in Part (a).   

(b)  Solve the social planner’s problem in this economy. 

1.  What is the optimal 
ratio?   
/k h
2.  What is the equilibrium growth rate of consumption? 

(c)  Solve for the decentralized competitive equilibrium:  Assume that labor supply is 
exogenous, and that the borrowing constraint is never binding.

6.  What is the growth rate of consumption?

(d)  Does the consumption growth in the competitive equilibrium from Part (c) 
match the social planner’s optimal consumption growth rate you found in Part 
(b)?  Why are they different or the same?  How is this model different than the 
learning by doing model in Question #1? 

(e)  Assume the government decides to tax a firm’s output in this economy.  In 
particular, assume the government takes a fraction 
yτ of all firms’ output.  The 
government then balances its budget by returning the tax as a lump sum payment 
 to individuals.  Resolve for the decentralized equilibrium as done in Part (c).
