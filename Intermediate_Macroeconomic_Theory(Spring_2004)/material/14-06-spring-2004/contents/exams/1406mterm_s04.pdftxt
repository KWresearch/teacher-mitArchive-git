Question 1 (Continuous Time)

Consider the neoclassical growth model, in continuous time. Assume that there is no population
growth and no exogenous technological change; and normalize the size of the population and labor
to 1. We examine decentralized competitive allocations.
We introduce a government in the model. The only role of the government is to redistrib-
ute income (there is no government spending). The government imposes a proportional tax on
household income and uses the collected taxes to ﬁnance a lump-sum transfer to each household.
Denote the time-invariant tax rate with τ ∈ [0, 1) and the transfer with Tt .
The budget of the representative household is thus

ct + it = (1 − τ ) (rtkt + wt ) + Tt ,
where ct denotes consumption, it investment, kt capital, rt the interest rate, and wt the wage rate.
The capital stock accumulates according to

(1)

˙kt = it − δkt ,
where δ ∈ (0, 1). The household’s lifetime utility is given by
U = Z ∞
c1−1/θ
1 − 1/θ
0
where ρ > 0 is the discount rate and θ > 0 is the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. The
household maximizes (3) sub ject to (1) and (2), taking wt and rt , as well as Tt and τ , as given.
Firms are perfectly competitive and maximize proﬁts. The technology is Cobb-Douglas. Out-
put at time t is thus

where kt denotes the capital stock, yt denotes output or income, and α ∈ (0, 1). Note that, in
equilibrium,

yt = rtkt + wt .

Finally, the government budget requires that the tax revenue covers the cost of the transfer, so
that

Tt = τ (rtkt + wt ) = τ yt .

of the tax rate on capital accumulation.

(e) Draw the phase diagram (that is, the ˙c = 0 and ˙k = 0 loci together with the saddle path)
for two cases: τ = τ high and τ = τ low , where τ low < τ high . Suppose the economy has been forever
in the steady state with τ = τ high > 0. Suddenly and unexpectedly, at some time t = t0 , the
government reduces the tax to τ low . Following the tax cut, τ is expected to stay at τ low forever.
How does consumption respond at t = t0? (Does it rise, fall, or is it ambiguous?) Give the
intuition. (Explain the associated substitution and wealth (or income) eﬀects.) Finally, how does
capital and output evolve over time following the tax cut?

taking wt and rt , as well as Tt and τ , as given.

Question 2

(a) Can the Solow growth model help us explain the cross-country diﬀerences in income levels?
Can it also help us explain the cross-country diﬀerences in saving rates?

(b) In the context of the Ramsey model, can cross-country diﬀerences in tax policies help
explain the cross-country diﬀerences in income levels and/or saving rates? (Hint: The results of
Question 1 should help you answer this question.)
