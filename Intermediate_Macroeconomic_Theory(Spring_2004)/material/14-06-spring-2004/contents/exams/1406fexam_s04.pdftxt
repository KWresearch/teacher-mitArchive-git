You have 1h30min. Please answer each question in separate booklets. Each question counts for
a total of 60 points. Allocate your time eﬃciently. If you can not answer some part analytically, but
you can still give the intuition for the sought result, your answer will count partially.

GOOD LUCK!!!

Question 1

[60 points]

Consider an endogenous growth economy. Time is discrete, t ∈ {0, 1, ...}; there is no population
growth; there is no exogenous technological change; and there is perfect competition. The source of
growth is productive services provided by the government.
The representative ﬁrm maximizes proﬁts,

Πt = Yt − rt Kt − wt Lt ,

sub ject to the technology

t L 1−α
Yt = At K α
(1)
.
t
where α ∈ (0, 1) denotes the income share of capital and At denotes productivity in period t. We assume
that the productivity of a ﬁrm increases with the level of public services. In particular, we denote the
level of government spending per head by gt and let

At = g 1−α
t

.

(2)

Note that the individual ﬁrm (or household) takes At as exogenous, but in general equilibrium At
increases with gt .
The government may impose a diﬀerent tax on income from ﬁnancial assets and a diﬀerent tax on
wages. We denote the tax on ﬁnancial assets by τ k and that on labor income by τ w . The government
budget writes

gt = τ k rt kt + τ w wt ,

(3)

where kt = Kt/Lt is the capital per head (or per household). Accordingly, the budget of the represen-
tative household is

Preferences are given by

U =

ct + kt+1 = (1 − τ k ) rt kt + (1 − τ w ) wt .
∞Xt=0
Finally, note that, from (2), (3), and (4), the resource constraint of the economy is

β tu(ct ), where u(c) = ln c.

kt+1 = yt − ct − gt .

(5)

(a) Characterize rt and wt from the ﬁrm’s problem. Combine then with (1)-(3) to express gt , yt ,
rt and wt in terms of kt and (τ k , τ w ) alone. Similarly, write the resource constraint (5) in terms of
(ct , kt , kt+1) and (τ k , τ w ) alone. Explain why this economy is an example of an AK−type economy.
Explain how do τ k and τ w aﬀect yt and rt .
[15 points]

(b) Write the Euler condition that characterizes optimal consumption growth in terms of (ct , ct+1 )
and (τ k , τ w ) alone. How do τ k and τ w aﬀect the incentives to save? Interpret.
(Hint: Do not try
to solve for savings. Another way to interpret this question is "how do τ k and τ w aﬀect the rate of
consumption growth?")
[10 points]

(c) Combining your results from parts (a) and (b) above, express the long-run growth rate of the
economy γ = ct+1/ct = yt+1/yt and the consumption-output ratio c/y = ct/yt as functions of (τ k , τ w ).
[HINT: You should already have the long run growth rate of the economy from part (b). To solve for
c/y , use your resource constraint from part (a) and divide through by kt . You will then need to use
the fact that on the balanced growth path, it must be that consumption and capital grow at the same
rate in order to solve for c/y ]
[5 points]

(d) Interpret the eﬀects of τ k and τ w on γ and c/y .
[10 points]
(e) Fix τ w = 0 and let τ k ∈ [0, 1]. What value of τ k maximizes c/y and what maximizes γ ? Next,
ﬁx τ k = 0 and let τ w ∈ [0, 1]. What value of τ w maximizes c/y and what maximizes γ ? Why is there a
diﬀerence?
[10 points]

(f ) Suppose that the government can choose freely both τ k and τ w so as to maximize social welfare.
Discuss what are the trade-oﬀs the government faces in choosing the optimal tax rates that maximize
social welfare. Is it optimal to use both τ w > 0 and τ k > 0, or just one of them, and if one which one?
[10 points]

Question 2
[60 points]
Discuss whether each of the following statements is true, false, or uncertain. Provide a brief but
clear explanation of your answer.

(a) If the aggregate technology exhibits constant returns with respect to the vector of accumulable
factors (diﬀerent types of capital), then the economy has necessarily a constant growth rate at all times,
and it is impossible to make sense of conditional convergence.
[15 points]

(b) More competition necessarily promotes economic growth and social welfare, since ﬁrms are
forced to produce more goods and extract less proﬁts from consumers.
[15 points]

(c) Consider an individual agent. If her income varies randomly from one period to another, then her
consumption will also vary from one period to another, but less so than her income.
[15 points]

(d) The neoclassical growth model (the RBC paradigm) can well account for the business-cycle
variation in output, investment, employment, and total factor productivity.
