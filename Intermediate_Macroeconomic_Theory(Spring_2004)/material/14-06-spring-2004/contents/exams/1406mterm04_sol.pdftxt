Question 1 (Continuous Time): (a) The household takes τ , wt , rt and Tt as given and selects a
consumption path to solve

sub ject to
˙kt = (1 − τ ) (rtkt + wt ) + Tt − ct − δkt
This is a simple optimal control problem where ct is the control variable and kt is the state variable. We
can write the Hamiltonian as
Ht = e−ρtu (ct ) + λt [(1 − τ ) (rtkt + wt ) + Tt − ct − δkt ]
where λt is the mutiplier on the co-state equation. The necessary conditions are

e−ρtu (ct ) dt

Using (1) we have that

(3)

·λt = −ρe−ρtu0 (ct ) + e−ρtu00 (ct ) ·ct
Putting (1) and (3) into (2) we get that
e−ρtu0 (ct ) [(1 − τ )rt − δ ] = ρe−ρtu0 (ct ) − e−ρtu00 (ct ) ·ct
u0 (ct ) [(1 − τ )rt − δ − ρ] = −u00 (ct ) ·ct

Euler equation:

Consumption growth is falling in the tax rate. A tax on capital income alters the tradeoﬀ between saving and
consmption (it taxes the former of these) and hence lowers the willingness of a houshold to lower consmption
today in order to consume more tomorrow. Put diﬀerently, it discourages consumption growth.
(b) In equilibrium the rate of interest is smply equal to the marginal product of capital:

rt = αkα−1
t

This is decreasing in the level of capital. This simply comes from the fact that the cobbdouglas function
displays diminishing returns to each individual factor.
(c) First, we know that consumption growth must obey the euler equation. We know also that in
general equilibrium the interest rate will be equal to the marginal product of capital. Accordingly we have
that
= θ £(1 − τ )αkα−1
t − δ − ρ¤

Next, we know that the growth of capital is governed by the resource constraint of the economy. Going
through this step by step we have that the households capital stock evolves according to
˙kt = (1 − τ ) (rtkt + wt ) + Tt − ct − δkt
Now in general equilibrium we know that

Accordinly, the resource constraint of the economy can be written as

kα
t = rtkt + wt
Tt = τ (rtkt + wt )

= δ + ρ

˙kt = kα
t − ct − δkt
Together (4) and (5) fully characterize the dynamics of consumption and capital..
(d) The steady state level of capital is found by setting ·ct = 0. This requires that
(1 − τ )αkα−1
t
and hence the steady state level of capital is
k∗ = µ α(1 − τ )
δ + ρ ¶ 1
1−α
This is decreasing in the tax rate. The tax on capital income eﬀectively taxes saving and hence discourages
saving. The result is a lower level of capital in steady state. From the perspective of the household the
capital stock must be higher so that the return on capital is increased to compensate for the tax on capital
income.
Its clear that the ˙kt = 0 locus (5) is unaﬀected by a change in
(e) Without drawing the phase diagram.
the tax rate (the proceeds of the tax are returned to the economy so the resource constraint doesn’t move).
The ·ct = 0 locus will move with the tax rate (in the way described above). The reduction in the tax
rate will shift this locus to the right.
At the time of the change consumption will unambiguously drop (to the new saddle path). This is
becasue now saving is more attractive and so consumers will take advantage of the higher (net) rate of
return on saving. They lower consumption today to fund higher savings (with a view to achieving a higher
level of consumption in the future).
Following the inital change capital rises due the increase in savings. As it rises both output and the rate
of return in captial fall. This continues until the net rate of return of capital is again equal to the households
discount rate. Ultimately outout, consumption and capital will all end up at a higher steady state level.
Question 1 (Discrete Time): (I Will Be Very Brief Here)
(a) Solve this as a standard constrained optimization. The lagrangian for the households problem can
be written as
∞Xt=0
∞Xt=0
β tu(ct ) −
where λt is the lagrange multiplier on the households budget constraint in period t. The FOC are
∂L

∂ kt+1

= 0 ⇔ β tu0 (ct ) = λt
= 0 ⇔ λt = λt+1 [(1 − δ) + (1 − τ )rt ]

λt [kt+1 − (1 − δ) kt − (1 − τ ) (rtkt + wt ) − Tt + ct ]

Putting (6) into (7) we get that
β tu0 (ct ) = β t+1u0 (ct+1 ) [(1 − δ) + (1 − τ )rt ]

This is the Euler equation.

and the resource constraint of the economy is

Note that this is the same as in the continuous time case when we observe that the discount factor is related
to the discount rate in the following way:
