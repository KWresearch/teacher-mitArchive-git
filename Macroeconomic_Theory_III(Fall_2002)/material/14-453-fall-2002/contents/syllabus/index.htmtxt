***** Course Overview *****
This course covers issues in the theory of consumption, investment and asset
prices. We lay out the basic models first, and then examine the empirical facts
that motivate extensions to these models.
Problem sets will be an important part of the course and an important part of
the workload. You are encouraged to work on the problem sets in groups but you
must turn in your own individual work. You have one week to turn in each
problem set. TA sessions will be largely devoted to the solution of the
previous week's problem set. In addition, some extra material may be covered by
the TA during recitation.
***** Grading *****
The final grade will be a weighted average of the problems sets (40%) and the
final exam (60%). The final exam will be during the time of our last scheduled
class.
***** Textbooks *****
No book is required but I expect to make use of the following books more than
once.
Blanchard, Olivier J., and Stanley Fisher. Lectures on Macroeconomics.
Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1989.
Deaton, Angus. Understanding Consumption. New York: Oxford University Press,
1992.
Ljungqvist, Lars, and Thomas J. Sargent. Recursive Macroeconomic Theory.
Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2000.
