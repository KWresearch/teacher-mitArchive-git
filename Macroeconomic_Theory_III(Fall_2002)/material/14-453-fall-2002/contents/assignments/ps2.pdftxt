1	 Marginal  Propensity  to  Consume  out  of 
Current  Income 

Consider  the  CEQ-PIH  consumption  function  which  leads  to  the  random 
walk  representation  for  consumption. 
Consider  the  following  income  processes:  (εt  has Et−1εt  = 0) 
(a)  i.i.d.  yt  = ¯y + εt 
(b)  autoregressive:  yt  = ¯y + ρyt−1  + εt 
(c)  random walk:  yt  = ¯y + yt−1  + εt 
(d)  persistent  changes  in  income:  ∆yt  = ¯y + ρ∆yt−1  + εt  (i.e.  (yt  − yt−1 ) = 
y¯ + ρ (yt−1  − yt−2 ) + εt ) 
The  change  in  consumption  at  time  t  can  be  expressed  as: 
∆ct  = µεt 
For  each  of  the  processes  above  ﬁnd  µ.  Interpret  your  results.  What  are  the 
implications  of  these  results  for  the  relative  volatility  of  consumption  and 
income? 

2 Durable  Goods  PIH 

Suppose consumer’s have the following preferences over durable goods (there 
are  no  non-durables  here): 
∞X 
β t u (St ) 
t=0 

E0

where 

St  = (1 − δ) St−1  + ct 
where St  represents the stock of durables and ct  the purchase of new durables, 
at  time  t.  Consumer’s  have  access  to  a  ﬁnancial  market  with  no  borrowing 
constraints.  Labor  income  is  the only  source of uncertainty,  the  interest  rate 
is  constant  and  equal  to  r . 

At+1  = (1 + r) (At  + yt  − ct ) 
(a) Write  out  the  maximization  problem  the  agent  faces.  Show  that  the 
ﬁrst  order  condition  for  optimality  is:

β j  (1 − δ)j  Etu 0  (St+1+j )

(b)  Show  that  (1)  implies: 

(1) 

u 0  (St ) = βREtu 0  (St+1 ) 

(2) 

(hint:  take (1) for t + 1, multiply it by β (1 − δ) and take Et (·) on both sides; 
subtract  this  from  (1)  for  period  t). 
(c) Alternate  route:  Show  that  the  budget  constraint  and  the  accumula­
tion  equation  implies  that

At+1  = (1 + r)  At  + yt  − St  1 −

where  At  =  At  + St−1 (1 − δ).  You  can  interpret  1 −  (1−δ)  as  the  (shadow)

cost  of  renting  a  unit  of  a  durable  good  and A  as  total  net wealth.

Rewrite  the  problem  for  the  consumer  in  terms  of  A  instead  of  A  and 
derive  the  ﬁrst  order  condition.  You  should  arrive  at  (2)  directly. 
(d)  Show  that  if  u  is  quadratic  and  β (1 + r) = 1  then  (2)  implies  that, 

∆ct  = ut  − (1 − δ) ut−1 . 
i.e.  the  innovations  in  consumption  have  a MA(1).  Interpret.

3	 Hand-to-Mouth Workers in the Ramsey Growth 
Model 

Consider  the  following  variantion  of  the  simplest  neoclassical  growth model. 
Half of  the population,  the  ‘hand-to-mouth’ consumers,  simply consume any 
labor  income  they  earn each period —  they never own any assets whatsoever. 
The  other  half,  the  ‘savers’,  have  preferences  and  choices  as  in  the  stan­
dard neoclassical model.  There  is no population growth and we conveniently 
normalize  the  total  population  to  be  (a  continuum)  of  size  2. 
The  preferences  for  the  savers  are  standard, 
∞X 
β t u (ct ) 
t=0 
for  some  β <  1,  and  u  twice  continuously  diﬀerentiable,  increasing  and 
strictly  concave  with  the  INADA  condition  limc→0 u0  (c) = ∞. 
Technology  is  given  by  the  constant  returns  to  scale  Cobb-Douglas  pro­
duction  function

Yt  = Kt

Labor,  Lt ,  is  supplied  inelastically  by  both  types  of  agents  each  period  with 
total labor supply normalized to 1.  The savers and the hand-to-mouth agents 
each  supply  1/2. 
The  resource  constraint  is, 
Ct  + Kt+1  = Yt  + (1 − δ) Kt 
where Ct  ≡ c1 
t  + c2 
t  is  aggregate  consumption  and  c1  represents  consumption 
of  hand  to mouth  consumers  and  c2  consumption  of  savers. 
Notice  that  we  do  not  describe  the  preferences  of  the  hand-to-mouth 
agents,  just  their  behavior. 
(a) Setup  the  standard description of markets  for  labor and capital,  stat­
ing  the  budget  constraints  faced  by  savers  and  hand  to  mouth  consumers, 
the  (static)  problem  of  the  ﬁrm.  Deﬁne  a  competitive  equilibrium. 
(b)  Show  that  in  equilibrium  the  labor  income  and  consumption  of  the 
hand-to-mouth  agents  is  a  constant  fraction  λ  of  output  Yt . Determine  λ. 
(c)  Argue  that  the  competitive  equilibrium  is  Pareto  Optimal  for  the 
‘savers’  in  the  following  sense,  it  solves:

ct  + Kt+1  = (1 − λ) Kt 
t 
where  λ  is  a  constant  fraction  of  output  that  goes  to  the  hand-to-mouth 
agents  found  in  (b). 
(d)  Does  the  introduction  of  the  hand-to-mouth  consumers  aﬀect  the 
steady  state  level  of  capital? 
(e) Does the introduction of the hand-to-mouth consumers aﬀect the equi­
librium  dynamics  of  consumption,  output  and  capital  relative  to  the  case 
without  hand-to-mouth  consumers?  Discuss:  stability,  uniqueness  of  the 
steady-state, monotonicity  and  the  speed  of  convergence  to  the  steady  state 
(hint:  for  the  speed  of  convergence  take  a  linear  approximation  around  the 
steady  state  with  and  without  the  hand-to-mouth  consumers) 

4	 Precautionary  Savings  in  General  Equilib-
rium 

(this  problem will  not  be  graded) 

Let  utility  be  given  by 

∞X 
β t u (ct ) 
t=0 
where  u (c) = − exp {−c} .  Assume  the  standard  intertemporal  budget  con­
straint 
At+1  = (1 + r) (At  + yt  − ct ) . 
Note:  we  do  not  necessarily  impose  β (1 + r)  =  1.  Assume  that  yt  is  i.i.d. 
across  time  and  agents.  Let  yt  = ¯y + εt  where  εt  is  iid  and  Et−1εt  = 0. 
(a)  Show  that  the  consumption  function, 
y¯¸

 ·

r

At  + yt  + 
r 
r 
[yt  − y¯] + rπ 
1 + r 
(b)  Use  the  Euler  equation  and  your  results  in  (a)  to  show  that  the  con­
sumption  function  in  (a)  is optimal  for  some π  (hint:  use  the Euler  equation 

for  some  π  implies 

− π


ct  = 

∆ct  =

to guess and verify  the optimality of  the above consumption  function) which 
depends  on  r  and  the  distribution  of  ε. 
(c) Show that π > 0 if β (1 + r) = 1. Compare this to the CEQ-PIH case. 
How  does  π  depend  on  the  uncertainty  in  yt? 
(d) Argue that in a steady state equilibrium where aggregate consumption 
and assets are constant we must have π = 0. This pins down  the equilibrium 
interest  rate,  r. 
Compute  the  equilibrium  interest  rate  re  for  β  =  .96, y¯ = 1  and  with  εt 
distributed normal with mean zero and standard deviation equal  to 0.2  (this 
distributional  assumption  allows  you  to  ﬁnd  an  expression  for  E exp (−ε)). 
Compare  this  to  the  interest  rate  that  prevails without  uncertainty. 
If we  added  capital,  what  could  be  said  about  the  capital  stock?
