1. Problem 1: The general expression that can be derived for the CEQ-PIH
case for the change in consumption is:
∞Xj=0
so we only need to compute this expression for the diﬀerent income processes.
For parts a) b) and c) we can derive the general case for a given ρ and
then think about the diﬀerent cases. So, assume yt = y + ρyt−1 + εt ,
0≤ ρ ≤ 1.That means that (inverting the lag polynomial)
∞Xρj

1 − ρ
j=0

yt = Etyt =

εt−j

y +

which implies that

Et−1 yt =

∞Xρj
j=1
yt − Et−1 yt = εt .
You can easily see following the steps I just did that in general

and then

εt−j

Et yt+j − Et−1yt+j = ρj εt
and replacing this in the equation for the change in consumption

So, assume ρ = 0 as in part a). In that case shocks are not persistent
at all.
If you have an increase in income today, that does not aﬀect
much your permanent income and thus you only want to consume a frac-
tion r
1+r of it (an annuity of it).
If ρ = 1, that means that any shock
in income translates directly to the same shock in permanent income,
shocks in current income aﬀect permanent income in the same value. In
that case, as your income increases the same in all periods, you con-
sume all the increase every period, ∆ct = 1
1 εt = εt . And for 0<ρ < 1
r
we have the intermediate case,
1+r−ρ . We have persistence but not too
strong (the more the closer to one) and thus consumption reaction will
1+r < r
r
be half way between the two cases discussed before,
1+r−ρ < 1.
For the last case we have

And this is bigger than one. This is intuitive. Now a shock aﬀects per-
manent income more than transitory and thus consumption should react

more.The implications for the variance of consumption are straight for-

ward. When income does not have much persistence (ρ < 1), then con-
sumption reacts little to shocks and thus it varies less than income. When
income has a lot of persistence (ρ = 1), the two variances are the same,
consumption follows current income. In the last case, consumption has a
higher variance than income. Here is when the excess smoothness puzzle
appears. According to data, consumption varies less than income, while
at the same time it can’t be rejected that income behaves like in d). Thus
the two facts are not consistent with the model. But can you really diﬀer-
entiate when income is a random walk or it follows a deterministic trend?

2. Problem 2: the maximization problem is
∞Xt=0
s.t.
St = (1 − δ ) St−1 + ct
At+1 = (1 + r) (At + yt − ct )
Note that from the accumulation equation we can write the stock of
durables as
∞Xj=0
(1 − δ)j ct−j
and replacing that on the utility function the ﬁnal problem is
β tu 
(1 − δ)j ct−j 

∞Xt=0
s.t.
At+1 = (1 + r) (At + yt − ct ) (λt is the associated multiplier
for each restriction)

St =

E0

The F.O.C. with respect to ct gives
∞Xj=0
while the condition for At+1 is

β j (1 − δ)j Etu0 (St+j ) = λt

λt = (1 + r)λt+1 .

and thus

∞Xj=0

β j (1 − δ)j Etu0 (St+j ) = (1 + r)λt+1

β j (1 − δ)j Etu0 (St+1+j ) = λt+1

From the ﬁrst equation we know (using the LIE)
∞Xj=0
and replacing this we get our result, equation (1) in the problem set. To
get equation (2) in the problem set, there is not much to do, just following
the steps explained is straightforward: the expression of (1) in t + 1 is (
once taken Et and multiplying by β (1 − δ))
∞Xj=0
β j (1 − δ)j Etu0 (St+1+j ) =
∞Xj=0
ββ (1 − δ) (1 + r)
and substracting one from each other we get the result we were looking
for,

β j (1 − δ)j Etu0 (St+2+j )

β (1 − δ)

u0 (St ) = βREtu0 (St+1 )
The alternate route can be done in the following way: deﬁne
˜At = At + St−1 (1 − δ)
and substitute this in the budget constraint to get
˜At+1 − St (1 − δ) = (1 + r) ³ ˜At + yt − St−1 (1 − δ) − ct´ ⇒
˜At+1 = (1 + r)  ˜At + yt − (St−1 (1 − δ) + ct )

(1 − δ)
(At+1 ) λt = (1 + r)λt+1 .

and again writing the ﬁrst condition in t+ 1 and substituting the λ0s in the
second we get our result. Alternatively you could substitute the new bud-
get constraint in the utility function, and the F.O.C. with respect to At+1
would
give
you
the
desired
result.
With a quadratic utility function we know the marginal utility is linear,
and so we get from the Euler condition

St = EtSt+1

or

St+1 = St + εt , Et−1 εt = 0,
the stock of durables follows a Martingale distribution. Then from the
accumulation equation,

ct = St − (1 − δ )St−1
ct−1 = St−1 − (1 − δ )St−2
and substracting the second equation from the ﬁrst

∆ct = ∆St − (1 − δ)∆St−1 .
From the Martingale property we know

∆St = εt for all t.

and thus we have our result,

∆ct = εt − (1 − δ)εt−1 .
And the intuition is clear, if you have a positive shock today and you
get more durables, tomorrow you don’t need to buy as much as today, as
you still have the nondepreciated part of what you bought. In particular,
when there is full depreciation, we are back to consumption being a ran-
dom walk. Thus the presence of durables can make consumption to be
dependent on past shocks

3. Problem 3: An equilibrium is a collection of factor prices such that ﬁrms
maximize proﬁts, and market of factors and goods clear at every period.

Solving as usual we get the standard Euler equation,

Markets have to clear which means Lt = 1 (we already used that before),
and At+1 = (1 + r)Kt+1 . In equilibrium we know that=

To see that the competitive equilibrium is not Pareto Optimal you just
need to ﬁnd the Euler equation for the second case (obtained as usual):
u0 (ct ) = β (1 + r − λ(r + δ))u0 (ct+1 ) .

The two Euler equations are diﬀerent and thus the equilibrium can’t be
optimum. Note that in steady state the P.O. solution has
β
λ
ebr∞ =
(1 − β )(1 − λ)
1 − λ
which is lower than in the competitive equilibrium, which implies that
agents are overaccumulating capital with respect to the optimum. They
could have a lower capital stock and a higher consumption. This is surpris-
ing because it implies that capitalists would be happy if they were taxed
and given this revenue. And constrained workers wouldn’t want this kind
of taxation on capital. The reason of this result is that the normal pecu-
niary externalities for an increase in the capital stock do not cancel out
now. Assume a typical individual in a Ramsey economy, for a unit of
additional capital his wage increases and the interest rate decreases. In
equilibrium with a unit of labor supply the two eﬀects cancel out. But now
the individual has half the labor supply. So he will overacumulate capital.
Mathematically, and additional unit of capital gives him (in capital labor
ratio terms) if he has an income of rk + w = f 0k + f − f 0k
f 0 (k) = r

but if he has rk + 1
2 w then he gets

f 0 = r +

f 00k + f 0 +

f 00k −
f 0 −
which is smaller for any value of k and so as he does no take it into account,
he will
tend
to
overacumulate with
respect
to
the P.O.
If we compare this to an economy with no hand-to-moth consumers, the
result is that we get the same capital stock in steady state as the Euler
equation (and thus the steady state interest rate) is the same. The rea-
son is that the hand-to-mouth consumers act as a lump-sum tax, it is the
same as if we had a Ramsey economy and we took half of the labor income
from the individuals. The marginal conditions for accumulation are not
distorted in the steady state and thus they will accumulate the same and
will consume less.
