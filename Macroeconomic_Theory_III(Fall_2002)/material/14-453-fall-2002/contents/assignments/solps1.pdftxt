Note  that  in  that  case we  no  longer  restrict  (as  in  the  usual  framework)  the 
coeﬃcient  of  risk  aversion  to  be  inversely  related  to  the  elasticity  of  intertem-
poral  substitution.  Now  (1-ρ)−1  is  the  elasticity  of  intertemporal  substitution 
while  α  captures  risk  aversion.  This  will  be  important  when  discussing  the 
results  of  the  problem  set. 

1.	 In this question you are asked to proof that if {vt } is implied by {ct}, then 
{λvt}  is  implied  by  {λct }.  To  do  that  we  only  need  to  verify  our  guess. 
Assume  this  is  true  for  t + j,  j  > 0.  Substitute  in  our  lifetime  utility  and 
check that it also holds  for time  t.

him  for  having  variability,  both  because  he  does  not  like  uncertainty  and 
he  does  not  like  to  substitute  over  time.  When  you  have  a  deterministic 
and constant path of consumption {c},  the ex ante  lifetime utility  is given

by  u(c) = (Et cα ) α  =  c  given  the  deﬁnition  of  u()  and  the  second  result 
derived  in  1.The  ex  ante  lifetime  utility  of  (1+  η)c,  given  our  ﬁrst  result,

is given by [Et{(1 + η)vt (ct )}α ] α  = (1+ η)[Et {vt (ct )}α ] α  = (1+ η)u0 . For 
the  individual  to  be  indiﬀerent  it  has  to  be  the  case  that

The  intuition  for  this  is  clear.  When  we  assume  α = ρ,  we  no  longer  have  a 
distinction between the coeﬃcients that capture risk aversion and intertemporal 
substitution  and  thus,  we  are  back  to  the  standard  expected  utility  framework 
with  CRRA  preferences.

4.	 Now  our  consumption  path  is  deterministic  and  intuitively  the  coeﬃcient 
that captures risk aversion should not play any role,  lifetime utility should 
not  depend  on  risk  aversion  if  there  isn’t  any.  That  is  the  reason  why, 
even  without  assuming  α  =  ρ  we  get  the  same  expression  than  before. 
Algebraically,  note  that  the  α  cancel  in  our  expression  as  we  know  that  v 
is  deterministic.  Thus  we  have

which  is  the  same expression we had  in 3.(without  the expectation  term),  so 
doing the  same  steps we get  to  the same result,

Now  we  have  to  compute  the  lifetime  utility  for  clh  =  {cl , ch , cl , ch , ...}  and 
chl  =  {ch, cl , ch , cl , ch , ...}.  I’ll  solve  the  ﬁrst  case,  the  second  can  be  found  fol-
lowing  the  same  steps.  From  our  expression  we  have

As  it  was  noticed  before,  the  solution  does  not  depend  on  α  because  the 
consumption  path  is  deterministic. 
But as we  still have diﬀerent consumption  levels  every period,  it depends on 
the  elasticity  of  substitution. 
When we  take  the  limit as  β → 1,  the  intuition  is  clear. The  individual does 
not  discount  the  future  any  more,  he  likes  it  as  much  as  the  present.  So  for 
him  it  does  not  make  any  diﬀerence  in  which  order  he  gets  the  consumption 

and  symmetrically,

levels  and  thus  both  paths  of  consumption  give  the  same  level  of  utility.  Note 
that  as  we  still  have  variability  in  consumption  over  time,  the  utility  levels  will 
depend  on  the  elasticity  of  intertemporal  substitution.  Algebraically,  applying

Using  our  equation  for  the  welfare  loss  for  c  =  2 (ch  +  cl )  and  u0  =  v0

Again  the  answer  does  not  depend  on  α.  Notice  that  if  the  individual  has 
∞  elasticity  of  intertemporal  substitution  (ρ →  1)  then  there is no loss at all. 
This  is  reasonable  since  it  does  not  matter  to  him  that  the  consumption  varies 
over  time.  And  the  less willing he  is  to  substitute over  time,  the bigger  the  loss. 
If  instead  of  a  deterministic  path we  have  uncertainty,  the  parameter  α  will 
play  a  role.  This  is  the  case  when  we  assume  that  consumption  path  can  take 
any  of  the  two  ex  ante  with  probability  1

5.	 Now  we  have  the  opposite  case.  Once  uncertainty  is  resolved  in  time  0, 
we have a deterministic and constant path of consumption.  Intuitively,  ex 
ante  lifetime  utility  should  not  depend  on  the  elasticity  of  intertemporal 
substitution but should depend on risk aversion as we have ex ante uncer-
tainty.  And  it  shouldn’t  depend  on  the  discount  factor  as  present  is  the 
same  than  future.  Algebraically,  we  now  that  v0h  and  v0l  are,  using  the 
result  derived  in  the  ﬁrst  part  of  the  exercise,

utility  should  depend  on  both  parameters,  α  and  β . Write  the  expression 
for  u0 ,

where I  used  the expression for  v0  given  initially.  Given  that  consumption 
is  i.i.d.  we  have  that 

α  1 
α  1 
(E0 v1 ) α  = (E1 v1 ) α  = u1 
Because  of  stationary  of  the  process  and  inﬁnite  horizon,  the  problem  is  the 
same  in  0  and  1,  i.e.  u0  = u1 . 
Thus  we  can  write

And as argued before,  it depends on both parameters because the  individual 
faces  both  uncertainty  and  ﬂuctuations  in  consumption.

When  the  agent  is  risk  neutral  (α = 1)  and  has  a  elasticity  of  intertemporal 
substitution  of  inﬁnite  (ρ  = 1),  there  is  no  loss.  for  a  given  ρ,  the  more  risk 
avert  (smaller  α),  the  bigger  the  loss.  And  for  a  given  α,  the  less  willing  to 
substitute,  the bigger the  loss.  Notice that the results vary more with ρ, that is, 
the  consumer  is  aﬀected  more  by  variability  on  the  path  of  consumption  than 
for  uncertainty  when  the  tolerance  to  any  of  those  things  is  small.
