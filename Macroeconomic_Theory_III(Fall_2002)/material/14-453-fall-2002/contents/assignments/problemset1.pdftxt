Intertemporal Elasticity of Substitution, Risk 
Aversion  and  the  Cost  of  Fluctuations 

The statement of the question  is  long precisely so your answer may be shorter 
—  please  do  not  display  al l  the  steps,  just  the  main  ones. 
This  problem  seeks  to  familiarize  you with  the  non-expected  utility  pref­
erence  speciﬁcation  introduced  by Kreps  and Porteus  (1978)  and  elaborated 
by  Epstein  and  Zin  (1991),  Weil  (1990).  You  are  also  asked  to  cost  of  ﬂuc­
tuations  in  consumption  as  Lucas  (1985)  with  these  preferences. 
Let  remaining  lifetime  utility  after  the  resolution  of  current  consumption 
at  time  t  be  given  by  vt .  Assume  vt  satisﬁes: 
α ¸ 1

vt  =  (1 − β ) ct  + β Etvt+1 
for  1 ≥ ρ  6= 0  and  1 ≥ α  6= 0. Think  of  this  equation  as  deﬁning  a  stochastic 
process  for  {vt}  given  a  stochastic  process  for  {ct}. In  any  period  t  before 
the  resolution  of  current  consumption  we  can deﬁne  lifetime  utility  by  ut  as: 

(1)

ut  = (Etvt  ) α

Questions: 
(a)  Show  that  if  {vt}  is  implied  by  {ct}  using  (1)  then  {λvt}  is  implied 
by  {λct}  using  (1)  for  any  λ >  0.  Show  that  if  ct  =  ψ  for  some  constant  ψ 
then  vt  and  ut  are  also  constant  and  equal  to ψ .  1 
(b) For any stationary process c = {ct} , with associated utility u0 , let c¯ de­
note  the  deterministic  and  constant  sequence  of  consumption  (E ct , E ct , · · ·). 
Deﬁne  our  measure  of  welfare  loss  from  the  variability  of  {ct}  to  be  that 
constant percentage  increase, η ,  in the process c that  is required to make the 
individual  indiﬀerent  between  (1 + η) c  and  c¯. 
Use  your  results  in  (a)  to  show  that: 

1 + η = 

E ct
u0

(c) Show that if  α = ρ  then:

utility  speciﬁcation. 
(d) (i) Show that if {ct} is deterministic then (3) holds (without the need 
for the  expectation operator of course). 
Use  this  to  compute  the value of utility obtained  if  clh  = (cl , ch , cl , ch , ...), 
denote  this  lifetime  utility  by  v0,l .  and  v0,h , chl  = (ch , cl , ch , cl , ...) .  How  does 
your  answer  depend  on  the  parameters  α  and  ρ? 
(ii) It is useful to think of the limit as β → 1. Show that v0,h  and v0,l  converge 
to  the  same  value.  What  is  the  intuition  for  this?  Compute  the  welfare  loss 
as  a  fraction  of  the  constant  consumption  stream  that  equals  the  average 
c¯ ≡  1
2 ch  +  1
2 cl .  How  does  your  answer  depend  on  the  parameters  α  and  ρ? 
(iii)  Compute  the  value  of  u0  if  the  sequences  clh  and  chl  occur  with  prob­
ability  1/2  (which  is  revealed  at  the  beginning  of  period  0)  as  β  →  1.  This 
1Given  these  results  we  could  say  that  vt  (ut )  represents  the  “certainty  equivalent 
constant  consumption”  from  t  on,  after  (before)  the  resolution  of  time  t  consumption.

should be very easy given your answer to (ii).  How does your answer depend 
on  the  parameters  α  and  ρ? 
(e)  (note:  we no  longer work with  the  limit β → 1 here, we are back  to β 
bounded  away  from  1)  Find  an  expression  for  utility,  u0 ,  when  {ct}  is  such 
that  c = (ch , ch , ...)  with  probability  1/2 and  c = (cl , cl , ...)  with  probability 
1/2.  How  does  your  answer  depend  on  the  parameters  α,  ρ? 
(f ) Let  ct  be  i.i.d.  distributed  over  time  with  outcomes  cl  and  ch  each 
with  probability  1/2.  Combine  (1)  and  (2)  and  the  fact  that  with  i.i.d. 
consumption  ut  = u0  to  show  that  u0  must  solve  of  the  form: 
[(1 − β ) ch  + βuρ  ρ  ¸ 1 
·

α α 
α 
ρ 
[(1 − β ) cl  + βuρ

Think  of  this  equation  as  implicitly  deﬁning  u0  (whether  it  does  so  uniquely 
is  an  interesting  question  I  am  not  asking).  Why  does  this  equation  involve 
both  of  the  parameters  α  and  ρ? 
(g)  You  will  now  use  equation  (4)  to  compute  u0  and then the  welfare 
loss,  η ,  as  deﬁned  in  (b)  of  consuming  the  i.i.d.  sequence  described  in  (f ). 
Use  the  following  parameters  througout:  β  =  .96  and  log ch  = 1.02  and 
log cl  = 0.98  (which gives a  std of  log consumption of 2.7%, higher  than  that 
used  by  Lucas  (1987)).  Compute  u0  and  η  for  all  nine  combinations  of  the 
parameters:  α  = 1,  1/2,  −1 and  ρ  = 1,  1/2,  −1.Display  your  results  for  η 
only  on  a  table  in  percentage  terms  (i.e.  multiply  by  100).  Do  your  results 
seem  to  vary more with  ρ  or  α? 
Hint:  to  solve  (2)  you  can  iterate  on  this  equation:  plug  in  a  good  initial 
guess  (such  as  u0  = 1  which  is  a  good  guess  based  on  the  results  in  (a))  on 
the  right  hand  side  and  compute  the  value  of  u0  that  results,  then  use  this 
new  number  on  the  right  hand  side  again,  etc...  Repeat  this  process  until  the 
numbers  you  get  converge  (that  is,  when  the  absolute  value  diﬀerence  is  less 
than  10−10 ,  say).  You  can  work  with  any  program  for  this:  Matlab  or  Excel 
wil l  certainly  do.  (you  probably  won’t  have  to  iterate  more  than  500  times 
(i.e.  copy  your  formula  down  500  rows  if  you  are  using  excel).
