1.1  Outline 
•	 review: 
welfare-costs  of  BCs 
PS#1 
•	 quick  (inaccurate)  historical  review: 
Keynesian  consumption  function  [30’s  and  40’s] 
→  Life  Cycle  (savings  and  growth;  deterministic  but  rich  heterogene-
ity)  [40’s  and  50’s] 
→  Friedman’s  PIH  (macro  models;  representative  agent,  inﬁnite  hori-
zon  but  uncertainty  center  role)  [50’s] 
→  rational  expectations  PIH  testable  implications:  critique  and  revi-
sion  [70’s] The  Euler  equation  [been  with  us  ever  since...] 
→  uncertainty:  representative  agent  Pareto Optima  [early  80’s] 
→  uncertainty:  precautionary  savings  and  buﬀer-stock  at  micro  level 
[early  70’s  and  late  80’s-present] 
→  aggregation  of  heterogenous  agents  with  incomplete  markets  [90’s 
and  recent] 

•  data 
•	 CEQ-PIH 
assumptions 

—  preferences:  quadratic  utility  and  negative  consumption 
—	 markets:  single  risk-less  asset  borrowing  and  lending 
implications: 
—  random-walk 
—  marginal  propensity  to  consume  of  income 

•	 Hall’s  (1978):  the  Euler  equation  as  THE  empirically  testable  impli-
cation  of  optimization 
•  most  important  tests:

Campbell  and Mankiw  (1989) 

1.2  Data 
•  Sources  for US  data 
—  aggregate:  NIPA 
—	 individual: 
PSID  (panel;  food  consumption) 
CEX  (cross  sections;  broader) 

•	 Aggregate consumption is smoother than income:  visually and by many 
statistical  measures,  e.g.  HP  ﬁltered  standard  deviation  is  1.27%  vs. 
1.72% 
•  std  of  components: 
—  non-durables  (ND):  0.86% 
—  durables  (D):  4.96% 

•	 individual data shows humped consumption patterns similar to income 
(review  later)

•  assumptions  required: 
—	 preferences: 
quadratic  utility  and  negative  consumption 
—  uncertainty  in  labor  income  only 

•  implications: 
•	 main insight:  consumption does not depend on current income once we 
control  for  total  “permanent”  or  “lifetime”  income 
•  notice  that: 
∆ct  ≡ ct  − ct−1  =

revision  in  remaining  lifetime  resources. 
•  implications: 
—  random-walk:  Et−1∆ct  = 0 
—	 marginal  propensity  to  consume  out  of  assets  is  r/ (1 + r) which 
is  “small”

•  if  income  is  persistent  and  we  do  not  control  for  permanent  income 
consumption may  respond  to  current  income  by more  than  r/ (1 + r) 
for  example  if  yt  is MA(2) 

∆ct  =

3 Hall 

•  revolutionary  idea:  forget  consumption  function,  ﬁnd  an  implication 
that  it must  satisfy 
•  general  consumer  problem 
•  implication:  necessary  condition 
u 0  (ct−1 ) = β (1 + r) Et−1u 0  (ct ) 
suﬃcient:  if we  add budget  constraint  (or with “T  = ∞”  the  transver-
sality)

•  Hall  approximation 
•  Hall  results 

4  Other  tests 

•	 Flavin  found  excess  sensitivity:  in  essence  same  as Hall’s  tests 
issues:  unit  roots  could  aﬀect  reliability  of  results  due  to  detrending 
•	 Campbell  and  Mankiw  (1989)  reinterpretation:  1/2  of  income  is  con-
sumed  automatically,  other  half  satisﬁes  PIH. 
Regression: 

∆ct  = λ∆yt  + ut 

instrumenting ∆yt ! 
•	 Excess smoothness:  Campbell and Deaton argue that the data shows a 
lot  of  persistence  so mg  prop  consume  should  be  higher  than  the  data 
show 
controversy  on  unit  roots
