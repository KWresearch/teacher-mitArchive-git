Motivation  for  studying  consumption 

•	 today’s  consumption  determines  savings  and  thus  —>future  capital, 
GDP  and  consumption 
•  distribution  of  welfare 
•  provides  evidence  or  not  of market  imperfections,  credit  constraints 
•  evidence of consumer rationality/irationality or consistency/inconsistency 
•  business  cycle:  main  fraction  of GDP

1.2 

Intertemporal  Preferences 

We  assume  rationality  in  that  at  any  point  in  time,  he  has  well  speciﬁed 
preferences  over  consumption  streams. 
In addition  we only deal (unless there is extra time — which I doubt) with 
cases  situations  where  there  are  no  preferences  reversals,  no  commitment 
problems:  consumption  plans  are  time  consistent  in  that  if  a  fully  speciﬁed 
plan  is  made  at  time  0  for  action  at  time  1  then  this  plan  remains  optimal 
from  the  point  of  view  of  period  1,  and  is  carried  out. 

1.2.1  Certainty 

Nothing  special. 
Commodity  space  sequences  or  stochastic  processes  of  dated  consump­
tion.  We may  or may  not  assume  that  ct  ≥ 0. 
As  usual  preferences  over  dated  consumption  c1 , c2 , ..., cT  can  be  repre­
sented  by  a  utility  function 

U (c1 , c2 , ..., cT ) 

1 

we may  allow  “T  = ∞”. 
Example  1:  additive  separability  over  time 
TX 
ut (ct ) 
t=0 
imposes a  strong  form of  separability:  note  that M RSs,t  does not depend on 
cτ  τ  6=  s, t.  Durability  and  habits  will  not  satisfy  this  (e.g.  if  you  just  went 
on  vacation  you  may  be  more  willing  to  wait  for  a  future  vacation).  Useful 
simpliﬁcation:  ut (c) = β t u (c) . 
Example  2:  Habit  Formation  and  durability 
TX 
ut  (ct , st ) 
t=0 
st  = f (st−1 , ct ) 
for  example  st  = (1 − δ) st−1  + ct  (durable  good where  ct .is  purchases  and  δ 
is  depreciation). 
Beneﬁts 
•  quite  ﬂexible 
•  technically  a  small  departure  from  separability 
1.2.2  Uncertainty 

Commodity  space:  stochastic  process. 
Nothing  special  either.  If  the  axioms  required  for  expected  utility  are 
satisﬁed  we  can  represent  preferences  over  random  consumption  streams 
c˜ 1 , c˜ 2 , ..., c˜ T  by the expected value of a Von-Neumann-Mogestern utility func­
tion  of  the  realized  consumption  stream: 

U (˜c1 , c˜ 2 , ..., c˜ T ) = E0u (c1 , c2 , ..., cT ) 

note:  of  course  any monotonic  transformation  on  U  is  allowed. 
Irrelevance  of  timing:  take  two  consumption  processes:  c1  and  c2  with 
the  property  that  they  have  the  same  distribution  but

Compare to deterministic sequence equal  to the expected consumption 
of  above  sequence  at  each  t.  Compute  the  required  λ  that  give  the 
same  utility  from  reducing  the  variance  to  zero. 
Let: 
o 
n
ct  = (1 + λ) (1 + g)t c0 exp  −σ2/2  zt 

Note  that, 

log ct  = log (1 + λ) + log c0  + t log (1 + g) + log εt 

Log-consumption has a deterministic linear trend.  We set log εt ˜N (0, σ2) . 
Estimates of  log εt  with post-war data yield σε  = 0.027. Let c0  = 1 and 
g = 0  for  simplicity.  To  evaluate  welfare  note  that:

•  since  aggregate  consumption  is  pretty  smooth  the  cost  of BC  is  low! 
•  what  about  the  cost  a  great  depression  using  this methodology? 
•	 beauty  of  idea  is  simplicity  and  the  non-expected  result  (reportedly 
Lucas did not expect this either and after seeing this became convinced 
that  it  is more  productive  to  work  on  growth) 
Comments  (caveats)

•	 calculations  sensitive  to  speciﬁcation  of  preferences  and  consumption 
process?  more  on  this  later. 
•	 these  preferences  aren’t  consistent  with  the  avg  returns  on  risk  assets 
so maybe  this  calculation  is  in  err  for  the  same  reason! 
•  heterogeneity  idiosyncratic  risk,  two  issues: 
(i)  remove  idiosyncratic  risk?  separate  policy 
(ii)  costs may  be  diﬀerent  for  diﬀerent  people 
•	 is  removing  ﬂuctuations  the  right  experiment? 
is  it  the  risk  and  ﬂucutations  about  BC  that  is  annoying  or  is  there 
something  else?  e.g.  if  ﬂuctuations  produce  intra-period  distortions 
between  c  and  l  these  may  not  be  correctly  captured  simply  by  the 
randomness  of  c  (and  l) 
We  need  technology  as well  as  preferences  to  do  something  like  that... 
•	 in  any  case,  is  removing  ﬂuctuations  feasible?  Again  we  need  technol­
ogy  as well  as  preferences! 
•  can  removing  the BC  change  growth,  g? 
1.4  Risk  aversion  vs.  Intertemporal  Substitution 

If  we  assume  preferences  are  given  by 
TX 
β t u (ct ) 
t=0 
Then  the  concavity  of  u will  dictate  both:  intertemporal  subtitutability  and 
risk  aversion.  No  intuitive  reason  for  these  two  aspects  of  preferences  to  be 
mingled. 
Quick  ﬁx:  use

TX 
β t u (ct ) 
t=0 
for  some  increasing  function  V .  Then  V  will  aﬀect  risk  aversion  but  not 
intertemporal  substituability. 
Problems:  (i)  preferences  over  future  consumption  generally  depend 
on  all  of  past  consumption  (preferences  are  not  recursive  in  a  small  state 

V

variable)

(ii)  related:  introduces  an  awkward  non-separability  in  that  the  marginal

rate  of  substitution  between....  Its  ﬁne  to  have  non-separabilities  over  time, 

but  these  are  out  of  control.


1.5  Non-Expected  Recursive  Utility 

Kreps  and  Porteus  (1978):  axioms  relax  irrelevance  of  timing.  Epstein  and 
Zin  (1989,  1991)  and  Weil  (1990)  make  this  operational.  It  allows  sepa­
ration  of  risk  aversion  and  intertemporal  substitution  without  introducing 
undesired  non-separabilities  (preferences  remain  recursive  in  that  they  are 
forward  looking) 
Main  Idea:

expected  utility  satisﬁes


Generalize  this  to: 

vt  = u (ct ) + βEtvt+1 

vt  = u (ct ) + βh (Eth (vt+1 ))−1 

for  some  h (·)  function.  Now,  h  aﬀects  risk  aversion  preferences  but  not 
intertemporal  substitutability  (think  of  the  deterministic  case:  the  inﬂuence 
of  h  vanishes). 
Example:  Iso-elastic,  with  additive  separability we  have: 

ρ ct 
vt  = + βEtvt+1
ρ 

equivalently: 

1 
1 
ρ 
[ρ (1 − β ) vt ] ρ  = [(1 − β ) ct  + βEtρ (1 − β ) vt+1 ] ρ 
· 
iρ¸ 1 
h
1 
ρ 
ρ 
(1 − β ) ct  + βEt  [ρ (1 − β ) vt+1 ] ρ

Letting Vt  = [ρ (1 − β ) vt ] ρ  which is an increasing transformation of vt  (check 
this)  we  reach: 
1 
ρ 
ρ 
Vt  = [(1 − β ) ct  + βEtVt
+1 ] ρ

in this homogenous representation has Vt  represent “constant equivalent con­
˜ 
sumption”:  if  c˜ t  =  λct  then  Vt  =  λVt  and  that  if  {ct}  is  deterministic  and 
constant  so  that  ct  = ¯ 
c  for  all  t,  then  Vt  = ¯
c. 
Generalization:  Above  is  equivalent  to 
ρ i 1 
h 
ρ 
ρ 
Vt  =  (1 − β ) ct  + β [EtVt
+1 ] ρ

which  suggests  the  generalization: 
α ¸ 1
·
³ 
´ ρ 
ρ 
ρ 
Vt  =  (1 − β ) ct  + β EtV α 
t+1 
if  α = ρ  then we  are  back  to  additive  separable  expected-utility  preferences. 

•  ρ  controls  intertemporal  substitutability 
•  α  controls  risk  aversion
