•  if  v 000 
t+1  > 0  then  there  are  precautionary  savings  during  period  t 
but  do  we  know  anything  about  v 000?

•	 CARA  is  an  unnatractive  assumption...  (depends  on  the  question) 
...but  useful  benchmark →  helps  understand  other  cases 
...can  be  thought  as  a  local  approximation  sometimes 
...good  for  aggregation  (linearity) 
•	 aggregation  example  from  problem  set  (discuss  after  seeing  Aiyagari’s 
model) 

3 Inﬁnte  vs.  Finite  periods 

•  inﬁnite: 
convenient;  sometimes  good  approximation  to  ﬁnite  but  long  horizon;

dynastic  interpretation

bad:  long  run  implications may  be  very  diﬀerent

•	 ﬁnite: 
more  realistic  for many  issues 
less  tractable

ation  Problem 

4.1  β (1 + r) = 1 
•  look  at  example  with CARA:  upward  drift  in  a 
•	 martingale  convergence  theorem: 
Euler  implies  u0 (ct ) must converge 

•	 if  r = 0  then  ct  → y¯ = E y 
Shechtman  (1975)  and  Bewley(1976) 
•  if  r > 0 then  ct  → ∞ 
•	 in  both  cases  at  → ∞ 
saving  is  very  attractive

∗ 
→  region  is  large  (z  large) 
→  it  is  approached monotonically 
- with  uncertainty  region may  be  small 
and  no  tendency  towards  it 
u00 (c)
—  assets  are  bounded  if  limc→0  u0 (c)  = 0  (thus,  true  for CRRA) 
—  if  u (c) ∈ HARA  class ⇒  c (z ) is concave 
•  Bellman  equation: 
v (z ) = max {u (c) + βE v ((1 + r) (z − c) + y˜)}
c 
v  is  increasing,  concave  and  diﬀerentiable. 
•	 f.o.c. 

u 0  (c) ≥ β (1 + r) E v 0  ((1 + r) a + ˜y) 
c + a0  = z ,  a0  ≥ 0;  f.o.c.  holds with  equality  if  c < z . 
⇒concavity  of  v 
⇒  concavity  of  Φ (a) = β (1 + r) E v 0  ((1 + r) a + ˜y) 
⇒standard  consumption  problem with  two  normal  goods 
⇒  c (z) and  a0  (z)  are  increasing  in  z

idea:  as  assets  become  large  uncertainty  from  income  is  not  important 
if  absolute  risk  aversion  goes  to  zero 
proof:

max  = (1 + r) a0 (z ) + 
We  need  to  show  that  there  exist  a  z  such  that  z 0 
∗
∗ 
ymax  ≤ z  for  z ≥ z . Write  the  Euler  condition  as: 
Eu0  (c (z 0 )) 
0 
u 0  (c (zmax )) 
u 0  (c (z )) = β (1 + r) 
u0  (c (z 0 
max )) 
Eu0 (c(z 0 ))  → 1  then we  are  done. 
if we  can  show  that  as  z → ∞  u0 (c(z 0 
max )) 
Note  that

1 ≥ 
u0  (c (z 0

u0 (c (z 0

u0  (c (z 0 
max))
We now  take  lim  on both  sides.  As  z → ∞ we  can  show  that a0  (z) and  c (z) 
go  to  inﬁnity,  therefore.  Fortunately we  can  show  that 
u0 (c − A) 
→ 1 
u0  (c) 
for A > 0.  To  see  this,  note  that  this  is  equivalent  to  prooving 
u0  (c) 
u0  (c + A) 

→ 1 

or 

→ 1 

We  have  1 ≤

the  last  inequality  holds  since  u0 (c−t) 
u0 (c)  >  1 for  all  t >  0.  The  result  follows 
since  limc→∞ γ (c − t) = 0  for  all  t ∈ [0, A].

to  get  a  relationship between K  and  r  —  a  steady  state  supply  curve  of 
capital, Ea (r).  From  the  second  equation 
r = Fk  (K, N ) − δ 
we  have  a  demand  relationship  between K  and  r :  K (r) .
