—  equilibrium of  representative  agent  economy  (Lucas  / Breeden) 
—  equilibrium with  complete markets  (Constantinides) 
complete  markets  ⇐⇒  Pareto  Optima  ⇐⇒  representative 
consumer  (weighted utility)

•	 Economic Theory: 
Does  not  usually  imply  predictions  for  the  price  of  2  goods...  So what 
game  are we playing? 
...but  if  we  know  something  about  technology  or  preferences  it  does! 
Here  we  assume  expected  utility  and  CRRA,  the  two  "goods"  (stocks 
vs.  bonds)  are  assumed  to  be  diﬀerent  only  in  their  risk. 
•	 Cochrane  cautions  and  notes  several  interesting  things.  These  do  not 
resolve  the  equity  premium puzzle  but  they  do  caution  us  to  interpret 
it  correctly: 
(1)  substantial  risk  in  stock market:  no  free  lunch  (no  qualitative  fail-
ure)  "you  can  lose  a  lot  of money  in  the  stock market" 
...  but we  assumed  no  free-lunch  to  derive  a  (quantitative)  equity pre-
mium puzzle 
(2) data may not be representative:  e.g.  the US did will but Argentina 

4 

did not

but we have 100  years of data!  one has  to  be  very

(3)  (related)  data  does  not  give  population moments,  just  sample mo-

ments:  we  need  std’s  on  the  size  of  the  puzzle...

...yet  Kocherlakota  and  Cochrane  and  Hansen  (1992)  includes  these

in  their  evaluation  of  the  equity  premium  puzzle  —  i.e.  the  failure  of

the Euler  condition — and  this does not  change  the  results,  although  it

weakens  it  a  bit

...  still  caution:  process  of  returns  could  be  non-stationary  or  highly

non-normal  (inferences  are  hard  from a  small  sample)


5  Discount  Factors:  LOP  and  NA 

I  follow Cochrane  and Hansen  (1992)  closely  —  great  paper  to  read. 

•  two periods  "now" and  "then"  (t  and  t + 1  if  you  prefer) 
•  J  "fundamental"  assets: 
—  payoﬀ  "then"  of  xj 
—  "now"  price  of  q j 

→  stack  into  x  and  q  (column)  vectors 
•  payoﬀ  space  for  "then" 
P  ≡ {p : p = c · x  for  some  c ∈ R} 
•	 pricing  function  π (p) : P  → R 
then  π (x) = q 
•  deﬁnition:  Law  of  One  Price  (LOP)  holds  if  the  pricing  function  is 
linear 
π (c · x) = c · π (x) = c · q 

5


⇒ c · x = c0  · x  then  c · q = c0  · q  1 
•  deﬁnition:  discount  factor  y ∈ P 
π (p) = E (yp) 

•	 Riesz  representation  Theorem 
LOP ⇔ ∃  (stochastic)  discount  factor  y ∈ P 
•  Let Y  be  the  set  of  all  discount  factors 
•  note:  y  may  be  negative 
•	 example: 

y ∗  = x 0  (E xx 0 )−1 q 
note:  if E xx0  is  non-singular  then  remove  assets  from x  until  it  is! 
a  non-singular  Exx0  means  that  (a)  there  is  a  risk-free  asset  (b)  there 
are  two ways  of  getting  the  same  payoﬀ 
•  Deﬁnition:  No Arbitrage  (NA)  holds 
p  ≥  0 ⇒ π (p) ≥ 0 
p >  0  (with positive  prob.) ⇒ π (p) > 0 
•	 result NA ⇔ ∃  strictly  positive  discount  factor  y > 0 
Let Y ++  be  the  set  of  all  discount  factors  that  are  positive 
•  examples

6  Hansen-Jagannathan  bounds 

All  equilibrium  theories  share: 

q  =  E (yp) 
y  =  f (data,  parameters) 

(see Cochrane’s  2001  book).  HJ: wonderful  diagnostic  tool  for models  of  y . 
•  data  on  a  single  excess  return  (π = 0) 
0 =  Emr = EmE r + cov (m, r)

EmE r

y = a + x 0 b + e 

•  population  regression: 

−1 ≤ 

•  by  deﬁnition  cov (e, x) = 0 
⇒ var (y) ≥ var (x 0b) 
•  idea  compute  x0 b  and  var (x0 b)  to  get  lower  bound 
→  check whether  theories  for  y  pass  this  test 
•  convenient 
—  no  need  to  recompute  lower  bound  for  each  theory 
—  helps  see where  the  theory  fails 

b  = [cov (x, x)]−1 cov (x, y) 
a  =  E y − Ex0b 
7 

•  note  that  cov (x, y) = q − E (y) E (x)  so: 
b = [cov (x, x)]−1  [q − E (y) E (x)] 
var ¡x 0  [cov (x, x)]−1  [q − E (y) E (x)] ¢ 
= var (x) [var (x)]−2 E (y)2 E (x)2 
•	 if we  knew E (y) we  have  a  lower  bound 
otherwise ⇒  feasible  region  for  pair  (E (y) , var (y)) 
•  3  cases: 
—  risk-less  return:  E (y)  pinned  down  and  risky  return 
—	 one  risky  excess-return  (stock market)  q = 0 
buzz words:  Sharpe  ratio  and market  price  of  risk 
—  general  case

7  Resolutions  (?) 

7.1  Preferences 
Game:  Change  preferences  of  representative  consumer 

•	 risk aversion vs.  intertemporal elasticity of substitution (Weil / Epstein 
and Zin) 
•  ﬁrst  order  risk  aversion  (Epstein  and Zin) 
•	 habit  persistence/  catching  up with  the  Joneses  (Abel/ Campbell  and 
Cochrane) 
•  loss-aversion

7.2  Heterogenous  Agent  Incomplete Markets 
Game:  model  heterogenous  agents with  incomplete markets 

•  uninsured  idiosyncratic  risk  (Mankiw/ Constantinides  and Duﬃe)... 
•	 ...  (related)  borrowing  constraints  (Luttmer  / Heaton  and Lucas) 
same Euler with  inequality 
•  constrained  optima with  limited  commitment  (Alvarez  and  Jermann) 
7.3  Knigtian  Uncertainty 
Knight:  risk  vs.  uncertainty 

•	 fear of not understanding returns / uncertainty over probability distri-
bution  /  desire  for  robust  decisions  (Hansen  and Sargent) 

7.4  No  risk  premium! 
Some  argue  there may  be  no  risk  premium  to  explain: 

•  high  returns  on  stocks were  unexpected  (McGratten  and Prescott) 
•	 bonds  have  a  liquidity  component  like money  explaining  there  low  re-
turn 
•	 stocks  are  more  risky  than  what  we  can  see  in  a  small  sample  (low 
probability  of  a  crash):  returns  are  non-normal 

8 Implications 

The  risk  premium puzzle: 

•  great  example  of  interplay  between  theory  and  data 
•  also:  theory  helps  organize  the  data,  even  if  theory  is wrong 
•	 no  strong  consensus  on  resolution  yet 
many  new  ideas  created 

9 

•	 richer  models  (i.e.  preferences  or  market  structures)  have  yet  to  be 
fully  explored  for  implications  (e.g.  BC  or  growth) 
•	 suggests  revisiting  the  Welfare  costs  of  Business  Cycles  (see  Alvarez 
and  Jermann’s  paper)
