2 Krusell  &  Smith 

•  out  of  steady  state  dynamics with  technology  shocks 
•  add  heterogeneity  in  β  to match  wealth  distribution 
•  recursive  equilibrium:  representative  agent 
v (k , K ) = max u (c) + β v (k 0 , K 0)
c,k0 

c + k 0  = (1 + r (K )) k + w (K ) 
K 0  = H (K ) 

•  stochastic  version: 
v (k , K, s) = max u (c) + β v (k 0 , K 0 , s 0 )
c,k0 

c + k 0  = (1 + r (K, s)) k + w (K, s) 
K 0  = H (K, s) 

•	 for  the Krusell-Smith model  the  state  is  the  whole  distribution  Ft 
larger  ob ject! 
•	 K-S method/approximation: 
carry  ﬁnite  amount  of moments  of  Ft  as  an  approximation 
•	 result:  don’t  need many moments;  one  is  enough! 
approximate  aggregation

region
