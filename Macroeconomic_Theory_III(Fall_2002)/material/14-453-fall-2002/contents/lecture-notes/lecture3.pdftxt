1.1  Overview 
•  review  of  CEQ-PIH  implications  and  tests 
•  aggregation  issues: 
—  goods 
—  agents 
—  time 

implications  for  the  tests  on  aggregate  data  (Attanasio) 
•  durable  goods  (problem  set #2) 
—  CEQ-PIH  version 
—  tests  (Mankiw,  1982) 
—  extensions  (Caballero,  1992) 

•  individual  data 
•  precautionary  savings: 
—  2 periods:  role of  u000  < 0 
—  exponential  utility  example 
—  quantify  aggregate  eﬀects 

•	 cross-sectional  and  cohort  data:  (Carroll  and  Summers  and  Attanasio 
papers) 

—  consumption/income  tracking  at medium  and  long  frequencies 
—  high-frequency  smoothing 

•  income-ﬂuctuations  problem:

2  Review of CEQ-PIH: Implications and Tests 

•	 quadratic utility,  negative  consumption and  rt  = δ  are  required  for  the 
simplest  versions 
•	 “random walk”  (martingale): 

∆ct  = ut 

with Et−1ut  = 0. 
•	 ut  is  perfectly  correlated  with  news  arriving  at  t  about  the  expected 
present  value  of  future  income:

(1 + r)j  [Etyt+j  − Et−1yt+j ]

then

•	 bottom  line  marginal  propensity  to  consume  is  dictated  by  the  perisi-
tence  of  income 
•  Two  types  of  tests:  (generally  on  aggregate  data) 
—	 random walk,  predictability  of  consumption; 
violations  are  termed  ‘excess  sensitivity’ 
econometric problem:  assuming  trend  stationarity  (TS)  if  income 
is  actually  diﬀerence  stationary  (DS) 
—	 marginal  propensity  to  consume  out  of  current  income 
Campbell  and  Deaton  argue  that  this  value  is  too  small  in  the 
data  given  the  perisistence  observed  in  yt 

•	 Both  tests  in  diﬀerent  ways  rely  on  the  persistence  of  income 
controversial  issue 
•	 without quadratic utility we are left with (we will see later today) Euler 
Equation 
which  can  be  tested  directly  (Hansen  and  Singleton) 
•  aggregation  problems  plague  the  aggregate  tests...

•	 agent  aggregation  is  problematic: 
Euler  equation  is  generally  non-linear 
Attanasio  and  Weber  argue  that  this  is  what  leads  to  rejection  on 
aggregate  data 
•	 time  aggregation: 
data  averaged  over  continuous  time 
→  introduces  serial  correlation 

•  example:  xt  is  a  random walk  t = 0, 1, 2, ... 

x0  = ε0 
x1  = ε0  + ε1 
x2  = ε0  + ε1  + ε2 

x3  = ε0  + ε1  + ε2 

•	 to  simplify  assume  ε0  =  ε2  = 0  then 
zt  = xt  + xt+1  for  t = 0, 2, 4, ... 
z0  = ε1

z1  = 2ε1

not  a  randow walk! 

•	 empirical solution:  use another lag (problem only happens between ad-
jacent  periods)
