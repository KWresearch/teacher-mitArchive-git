Homework   Contract  

Please  put  your  initials  next  to  the  homework  option  that  you  choose  and  also  print  and 
sign  your   name   at  the  bottom.  Until  we  receive  your  signed  contract  and  option  choice  we  will 
assume  that  you’ve  chosen  Option  1.  If  you  choose  Option  1  you  can  switch to  Option  2 at 
any time,   but  you  will  receive   a  zero  for   homework  up to   that  time.  If  you  choose  Option  2, 
you  cannot  switch  later  to  Option  1. 

Option  1:  You  do  not  hand  in  homework,  and  we  obviously  don’t  record  it  or  
consider   it  in  the   ﬁrst  cut  of  the  ﬁnal  grade. 

Option  2:  You  choose  to  hand  in  the  homework.  It  will  be  evaluated   as  indicated  in 
the  information  handout,  and   the  homework   and   exams  will  be  weighted   as  indicated.  If  you 
choose  this  second  option,  we  ask  that  you  not  use  bibles  and  that  you  list  the  names  of  those 
you   collaborated  with   on  the   problem  set.  If  there  is  clear  evidence  of misuse  of  bibles  or  
collaboration,  you  will  lose  the  percentage  allocated  for  homework  at   the  end   of  the  semester 
(i.e.  your  homework  performance   will   be  recorded  as  zero).  Of   course,  whether   you  choose 
Option  1  or  2,  we  will  assume  that  you  are  doing  the  homework  as  we  prepare  and  grade  the 
exams.
