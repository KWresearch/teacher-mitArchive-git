QUIZ  2,  Spring  2003 
Question  Booklet 

•	 This  quiz  is  closed   book,  but  two  “crib”  sheets  are  allowed. 
•	 Put your name on each   sheet of the answer booklet, and your recitation instructor’s name 
and  time  on  the  cover  page  of  that  booklet. 
•	 Only  the  answer  booklet  will  be  considered  in  the  grading;  no  additional  answer  or 
solution   written   elsewhere  will  be   considered.  Absolutely  no  exceptions! 
•	 Neat  work  and   clear  explanations   count;  show  all  relevant  work  and  reasoning!  
You  may  want  to  ﬁrst  work  things  through  on  scratch  paper  and  then  neatly  transfer  to 
the  answer  booklet  the  work  you  would  like  us  to  look  at.  Let  us  know  if  you  need 
additional  scratch  paper. 
•	 The quiz will be graded out of 50  points.  The three  problems  are nominally weighted 
as  indicated  (but  our  legal  department wishes  to  let  you  know  that we  reserve  the  right 
to  modify  the  weighting  slightly   when  we  grade,  if  your  collective  answers  and  common 
errors  end  up  suggesting  that  a modiﬁed  weighting  would  be more  appropriate).

(i)  Find  a  ﬁrst-order  state-space  model  for  System  1,  using 	 q1 (t)  to  denote  its  state 
variable,  and  arranging  things  such  that 

H1 (s) =

+ 1 . 

y1 (t) = q1 (t) + x1 (t) . 

(ii)  Is  your  state-space  model  for  System  1: 
•  reachable?

•  observable? 

•  asymptotically  stable? 
(b)  Suppose  System  2 in  the  block  diagram  above  is  described  by  the  ﬁrst-order  state-space 
model 

q˙2 (t) =  µq2 (t) + x2 (t) 
y2 (t) = 2q2 (t) 
where  µ  is  a  parameter,  and  we  are  given  that  µ  (cid:3)= 1. 
(i)  What  is  the  transfer  function H2 (s) of System 2?

(ii)  Compute  the  transfer  function  H (s) from  x1 (t) to  y2 (t)  using  the  model  in  (c)(i), 
and  verify  that  it  equals  H1 (s)H2 (s).  This  is  a  little  grungy,  but  important  as  a 
check  on  your  answer  in  (c)(i). 
(iii)  What  are  the  eigenvalues  of 	 A  in  (c)(i)?  Check  that  the  eigenvalues  you  obtain 
are  consistent  with  what  you  expect  from  your  results  in  (c)(ii).  What  are  the 
eigenvectors   associated  with  these  eigenvalues? 
There are values of µ for which one can ﬁnd nonzero  initial conditions q(0) such that 
the  resulting  zero-input  solution  q(t)  (i.e.,  the  solution  with  x1 (t) ≡ 0)  decays  to  0 
as  t → ∞. Find al l   such values of µ, and  for each  such µ  specify al l   initial conditions 
that  lead  to  such  decaying  zero-input  solutions. 
(iv)  For  what  values  of  µ,  if  any,  is  the  overall  system  in  (c)(ii): 
•  unreachable?  —  which  natural  frequencies  are  unreachable? 
•  unobservable?  —  which  natural  frequencies  are  unobservable? 
Interpret your  results  in  terms of pole-zero cancellations  in the block diagram on  the 
previous  page. 

(d)  Suppose  you  can measure  both  state  variables  q1 (t) and  q2 (t),  so  that  you  can  choose 

x1 (t) = g1 q1 (t) + g2 q2 (t) . 

The  resulting  closed-loop  system  is  evidently  still  described  by  a  second-order  LTI  state-
space model.  What choice of g1  and g2  will result in the closed-loop natural (or character-
istic)  frequencies  being  at −1 ± j 1?  You  can  express  your  answer  in  term  of  µ.  (If  you’ve 
done  things  correctly,  you  will  ﬁnd  that  when  µ  =  2,  for  example,  you  get  g1  =  0  and 
g2  = −5;  and  when  µ = 1,  you  get  g1  = 1  and  g2  = −5.)  Now  determine  for  what  values 
of µ,  if  any,  your  expressions  for  g1  and/or  g2  have  inﬁnite magnitude,  and  reconcile  your 
answer  with  what  you  found  in  (c)(iv). 

(e)  Suppose you can only measure the input x1 (t) and the output y2 (t).  Fully specify a scheme 
for  estimating  the  state  variables  q1 (t) and  q2 (t),  in  such  a  way  that  the  error  between 
each  of  the  actual  and  estimated  state  variables  can  be  expressed  as  a  linear  combination 
of  two  decaying   exponential  terms  with  time   constants   of  0.5 and  0.25  respectively.  Will 
your  estimation  scheme work  for  all  values  of  µ?  Again,  reconcile  your  answer with what 
you  found  in  (c)(iv).

Problem  2  (7  points) 

Quiz  2,  April  23,  2003 

Consider  a  nonlinear  time-invariant  state-space  model  described  in  the  form 

q˙1 (t) =  q2 (t) 
q˙2 (t) =  −β q1 (t) + x(t) , 
3 
where  β is  some  positive  constant. 

(a)  If  the  input	 x(t)  is  ﬁxed  at  a  constant  positive  value  x >  0,  determine  the  possible 
equilibrium  values  q and  q of  q1 (t) and  q2 (t)  respectively.

(b)  If the input actually deviates by a small amount  ˇ(t) = x(t)− x from its equilibrium value, 
x
and  if  the  state variables correspondingly deviate by  small amounts  ˇq1 (t) = q1 (t) − q and
qˇ2 (t) =  q2 (t) − q respectively  from  their  equilibrium  values,  ﬁnd  a  linearized   LTI  state-

space model  that  approximately  describes  how  these  small  deviations  are  related  to  each 
q1 (t) and  ˇ
q2 (t)  as  state 
other.  In  other  words,  ﬁnd  an  LTI  state-space  model  that  has  ˇ
variables,  and  ˇ(t)  as  input.  Is  your  linearized model  asymptotically  stable?  [In  deriving 
x
the  linearized model,  it may  help  you  to  recall  that  (1 + )3  ≈ 1 + 3 for  || (cid:10)1.] 

Problem  3  (7  points) 

Consider  our  standard  system  for  DT  processing  of  CT  signals,  where  the  C/D  converter 
samples  the  continuous-time  signal  xc (t) with  a  sampling  interval  of  T  seconds,  while  the  ideal 
D/C  converter  at  the  output  produces  a  bandlimited  interpolation  of  the  samples  y [n] using  a 
reconstruction  interval  of  T  seconds.

Suppose the LTI discrete-time system between these two converters  is a notch   ﬁlter,  i.e.  has 
a  frequency  response H (ejΩ )  whose  value  is  0  at  Ω = ±Ωo  (where  Ωo  > 0  is  termed  the  “notch 
frequency”)  and  whose  value  is  nonzero  everywhere  else  in  the  interval  |Ω| < π .  Suppose  the 
input  signal  is  of  the  form 

xc (t) = cos(ωin t + θ) . 
Determine  ALL  — and  we  mean  all! —  values  of  ωin  for  which  the  output  yc (t)  will  be 
identically  0.
