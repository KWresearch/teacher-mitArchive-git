Problem 1  (10  points) 

Consider  the  single-input  single-output  Lth-order  CT  LTI  state-space  system 

q˙ (t) = Aq(t) + bx(t) ,

y(t) = c T q(t) + dx(t)  , 

whose  transfer  function  is  H (s) =  ν (s)/a(s),  where  a(s) =  det(sI  − A)  is  the  characteristic 
polynomial  of  the  system. 
(You  might  ﬁnd  it  useful  to  check  that  your  answers  to  the  questions  below  make  sense  for 
the case where  L = 1.)

state-space  representation,  i.e.,  express  the  quantities  Ain , bin , cT 
in , din  in  the  state-space 
representation  below  in  terms  of A, b, cT , d:

(b)  (4 points) Determine the degree of the polynomial ν (s) (deﬁned by the expression for H (s) 
(cid:3)=  0?  (Hint:  Either  ﬁgure  out  how  ν (s)  is  related  to  the  characteristic 
given  above)  if  d 
polynomial  of Ain ,  or  think  about  the  representation  of  the  transfer  function H (s) of  the 
original  system  in  modal  coordinates.)

Problem 2  (40  points) 

Some  parts  of  this  problem  build  on  previous  parts,  so  it  is  important  that  you  proceed 
carefully,  and  check  answers  as  you  go. 
� 
� 
A  particular  DT WSS  random  process  κ[n]  has  autocorrelation  function 
Rκκ [m] = 10δ [m] + 3γ δ [m − 1] + δ [m + 1] 

. 

(a)  (5  points)  What  are  the  most  positive  and  most  negative  values  that  γ  can take in this 
instance?  Determine  the  mean  and  variance  of  κ[n],  and  also  the  correlation  coeﬃcient 
between κ[n] and κ[n−1].  (If you have trouble deducing the mean from the autocorrelation 
function,  perhaps  you’ll  see  another  way  to  deduce  it  after  you  do  part  (b)  below.) 

For  the  rest  of  this  problem,  assume  γ  = 1. 

(b)  (8  points)  Show  that  κ[n]  can  be  generated  as  the  output  of  an  appropriate  stable  ﬁrst-
order  state-space  system  driven  from  time  −∞  by  a  (zero-mean)  white  process  w[ · ] of 
unit  intensity,  so  w[n]  has  variance  1.  (Hint:  First  consider  what  unit  sample  response 
or  transfer  function  you  would  want  this  system  to  have.)  Explicitly  write  down  this 
state-space  system  in  the  following  form: 

q [n + 1] = αq [n] + βw[n]  ,

κ[n] = ξ q [n] + dw[n] , 

with  appropriately  chosen  values  of  the  coeﬃcients  α, β , ξ , d.  Be  sure  to  explain  your 
reasoning! 

(You might ﬁnd more  than one ﬁrst-order  state-space model  that will accomplish  the  job, 
but  any  one  of  them  will  suﬃce  as  an  answer  for  our  purposes.) 

(c)  (8  points)  Suppose we  have  another  ﬁrst-order  state-space  system,  driven  by  the  colored 
process  κ[n]  that  was  produced  by  the  system  in  (b).  Let  p[n]  denote  the  state  variable 
of  this  system,  and  assume  the  output  y [n]  of  this  system  can  be measured.  The  system 
thus  takes  the  form 

p[n + 1] = ap[n] + bκ[n]  ,

y [n] = p[n] + v [n]  . 

Here  a  and  b  are  some  ﬁxed  nonzero  scalar  parameters whose  precise  values  don’t matter 
to  us,  and  v [n]  is  a  (zero-mean)  white  measurement-noise  process  with  variance  σ2  and 
is  uncorrelated  with  w[ · ].  Combine  this  system  description  with  your  result  from  (b) 
to  careful ly  write  down  a  second-order  state-space  model  with  state  variables  q [n] and 
p[n],  white  input  w[n],  and  measured  output  y [n].  Also  determine  the  eigenvalues  and 
eigenvectors  associated  with  the  system  (i.e.,  the  eigenvalues  and  eigenvectors  of  the  one-
step  state  transition  matrix  of  this  system).  As  a  check,  one  of  the  eigenvalues  of  your 
model  should  turn  out  to  be  0;  if  it  isn’t,  then  you  have  made  an  error  somewhere!

(d)  (6 points) Determine what conditions, if any, have to be satisﬁed by the various coeﬃcients 
in  this  problem  for  the  second-order  system  you  derived  in  (c)  to  be: 

(i)	 reachable  from  the  input  signal  w[n]? 
(ii)  observable  in  the  output  signal  y [n]? 

For  each  of  the above  cases,  also  specify which modes of  this  second-order  system become 
unreachable  or  unobservable  when  the  respective  conditions  are  not  satisﬁed. 

(e)  (9  points)  Suppose	 w[n],  κ[n] and  v [n]  cannot  be  measured,  although  their  properties 
in  detail  the  equations  of  a  second-order  observer  to  propagate  estimates  q�[n] and  p�[n] of 
speciﬁed  above  are  known.  However,  as  mentioned  before,  y [n] is  measured.  Write  down 
describing  the  evolution  of  the  errors  q�[n] =  q [n] − q�[n] and  p�[n] =  p[n] − p�[n].  Pick  the 
q [n] and p[n] respectively  for all n ≥ 0.  Also write down a  second-order  state-space model

Problem 3  (20  points) 

A  certain  zero-mean  CT  WSS  signal  y(t)  with  autocorrelation  function  Ryy (τ )  and  corre-
sponding power  spectral  density  (PSD)  Syy (jω)  is  transmitted  through  a  channel.  The charac-
teristics  of  the  channel  and  receiver  are  such  that  the  received  signal  x(t) is  of the  form 

x(t) = by(t) + v(t)  . 

The  quantity  v(t)  represents  receiver  noise,  and  is  a  zero-mean  WSS  noise  process  with  auto-
correlation  function Rvv (τ ) and corresponding PSD Svv (jω),  and  is uncorrelated with  y( · ),  i.e. 
Ryv (τ ) = 0.  The quantity  b  is  a  random  variable  that  is  independent  of  y( · ) and  v( · ),  and 
that  takes  the  value  1  or  0  for  all  time;  it  can  be  thought  of  as  indicating  whether  the  channel 
works  (b = 1)  or  doesn’t  (b = 0).  The  probability  that  b = 1  is  p.

stable  and  possibly  noncausal  LTI  (Wiener)  ﬁlter  that  takes  as  input  the  received  signal 
y�(t)  of  the  transmitted  signal  y(t),  i.e.,  ﬁnd  the  ﬁlter  that  minimizes  E [{y(t) − y�(t)}2 ]. 
x(t)  and  produces  as  output  the  (linear)  minimum  mean-square-error  (MMSE)  estimate 
Express  your  answer  in  terms  of  quantities  speciﬁed  in  the  problem  statement.  Check 
that  your  ﬁlter  specializes  to  what  you  expect  when  p = 1  and  p = 0. 
(b)  (5 points) Find an expression for the PSD See(jω) of the error e(t) = y(t)− y�(t) associated 
with  the  optimum  ﬁlter  you  designed  in  (a),  again  expressing  your  answer  in  terms  of 
quantities  speciﬁed  in  the  problem  statement.  Again  check  that  your  expression  reduces 
to  what  you  expect  when  p = 1  and  p = 0.
