Problem 1  (16  points) 

A  particular  ob ject  of  unit  mass,  constrained  to  move  in  a  straight  line,  is  acted  on  by 
an  external  force  x(t)   and   restrained   by   a   cubic   spring.   The   system   can   be   described   by   the  
equation 

d2p(t) 
dt2 
where   p(t)  denotes  the  position  of  the  mass  and  p3 (t) is  the  cube  of  the  position  (not  its  third 
derivative!);  the  quantities  k  and    are   known   positive   constants.  

+  kp(t) − p

3 (t) =  x(t)  ,

(a)  (4  points)  Obtain  a  state-space  model  for  the  above  system,  using  physically  meaningful 
state  variables;  take  x(t)   to   be   the   input   and   let   the   output   y(t) be  the  position  of  the 
mass.  

(b)   (5   points)   Suppose   x(t) ≡ 0  and  the  system  is  in  equilibrium.  You  will  ﬁnd  that  there  are 
three  possible  equilibrium  conditions  of  the  system.  Determine  the  values  of  your  state 
variables  in  each  of  these  three  equilibrium  conditions,  expressing  your  results  in  terms 
of  the  parameters  k  and  . 

(c)  (7  points)	 For  each  of  the  three  equilibrium  positions  you  identiﬁed  in  (b),  obtain  a 
linearized  state-space  model  that  approximately  describes  small  deviations  away  from  the 
equilibrium.  We  are  looking  for  the  standard  “A, b, cT  , d” description  for  each  linearized 
model.  Which  of  these  three  linearized  models,  if  any,  is  asymptotically  stable?  Explain 
your  answer.

Problem 2  (16  points) 

[Part  (c)  below  can  be  done  even  if  you  don’t  get  part  (b).] 

A  particular  second-order  continuous-time  causal  LTI  system  has  natural  frequencies  λ1  = 
−3 and  λ2  =  −4  (these  are  the  eigenvalues  of  the  matrix  that  governs  state  evolution),  with 
associated  eigenvectors  v1  and  v2  respectively.   Its   input-output   transfer   function   is  

H (s) =  

s + 1  
(s + 3)(s + 4)  

. 

(a)   (2   points)   Is   the   system   reachable?   Is   it   observable?   Explain.  

(b)   (4   points)   Suppose   the   system   is   initially at   rest,   i.e.,   its   initial   state   is   zero.   Is   it   now  
possible   to   choose   the   input   in   such as   way that   the   state   moves   out along   the   eigenvector  
v1 , with  no  component  along  v2  during  the  entire  motion?  Explain  your  answer  carefully. 

(c)   (10   points)   Suppose   the   output   of   the   above   system   is   applied   to   the   input   of   another  
causal   second-order   LTI   system   with   transfer   function  

G(s) =  

s + 3  
s(s + 5)  

. 

The   input   to   the   combined   system   is   then   just   the   original   input   to   the   ﬁrst   system,   while  
the   output   of   the   combined   system   is   the   output   of   the   second   system:  

− − − > 

s + 1  
(s + 3)(s + 4)  

− − − > 

s + 3  
s(s + 5)  

− − − > 

(i)  (2  points)  How  many  state  variables  are  there  in  the  state-space  description  of  the 
combined  system,  and  what  are  the  natural  frequencies  of  this  combined  system? 

(ii)  (2  points)  Is  the  combined  system  asymptotically  stable?  Explain. 

(iii)   (3   points) Is   the   combined   system   reachable   from   the   input   of   the   ﬁrst   system?   Is  
it  observable  from  the  output  of  the  second  system?  Explain. 

(iv)  (3  points)  If  you  were  to  build  an  observer  for  the  combined  system  (using  measure­
ments   of   the   input   to   the   ﬁrst   system   and   the   output   of   the   second   system),   could  
you  get  the  estimation  error  of  the  observer  to  decay?  If  not,  why  not;  and  if  so, 
could   you   get   the   error   to   decay   arbitrarily   fast?  

Remember  to  explain  all  your  answers,  to  receive  the  indicated  credit!

Consider  the  causal  discrete-time  LTI  system 
q[n] +  

q[n + 1] =  

0
1 
−6  −5

�  �

where   x[n] is   a   control   input   and   w[n] is   a   disturbance   input.  

(a)  (3  points)	 What  are  the  natural  frequencies  of  the  system  (i.e.,  the  eigenvalues  of  the 
state  evolution  matrix)?  Is  the  system  asymptotically  stable? 

(b)   (6   points)   Suppose   you   use   the   LTI   state   feedback  

x[n] =  g1 q1 [n] +  g2 q2 [n] . 

What  choice  of  the  gains  g1  and  g2  will  yield  the  closed-loop  characteristic  polynomial 
z (z + 0.5)?  For  this  choice,  write  down  the  eigenvalues  of  the  matrix  that  describes  the 
state  evolution  of  the  closed-loop  system,  and  compute  the  associated  eigenvectors. 

(c)   (2   points)   Suppose   the   system   output   is   y [n] =  q1 [n].  With  x[n]   chosen   as   in   (b),   is   the  
closed-loop   system   observable?   Show   reasoning.  

(d)  (3  points)  With  x[n] as in  (b)  and  y [n]   as   in   (c),   what   is   the   transfer   function   from   w[n] 
to  y [n] for  the  closed-loop  system? 

(e)  (4  points)  Determine  in  two  distinct  ways,  using  the  results  in  (b),  (c),  (d),  whether  or 
not   the   closed-loop   system   is   reachable   from   the   disturbance   input   w[n].  Explain  your 
two   approaches   clearly.
