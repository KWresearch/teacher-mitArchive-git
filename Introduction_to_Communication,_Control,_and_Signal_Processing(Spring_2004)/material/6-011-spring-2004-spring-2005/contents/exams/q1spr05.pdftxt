Quiz  1,  March  15,  2005 

Problem 1  (20  points) 

Suppose  x(t) =  y(t) cos(ωo t + Θ),  where:  y(t)  is  a  wide-sense  stationary  (WSS)  process 
with mean  µy  and  autocovariance  function Cyy (τ );  ωo  is  a  known  constant;  and Θ  is  a  random 
variable  that  is  independent of y( · ) and  is uniformly distributed  in  the  interval  [0, 2π ].  Do part 
(a)  below  especially  carefully,  because  (b)  and  (c)  depend  on  it  to  some  extent! 
You  might  ﬁnd  it  helpful  in  one  or  more  parts  of  the  problem  to  recall  that 

cos(A) cos(B ) = 

1 
[cos(A + B ) + cos(A − B )] . 
2 

(a)  (8 points) Find the mean µx(t) and autocorrelation  function E [x(t + τ )x(t)] of the process 
x( · ).  Also  ﬁnd  the  cross-correlation  function  E [y(t + τ )x(t)].  Explain  precisely  what 
features  of  your  answers  tell  you  that:  (i)  x( · )  is  a WSS  process;  and  (ii)  x( · ) and  y( · ) 
are  jointly WSS. 
(b)  (6  points)  Suppose  Cyy (τ ) =  e−|τ |  and  µy 
(cid:4)=  0.  Obtain  an  expression  for  the  power 
spectral  density  (PSD)  Syy (jω)  in  this  case,  and  draw  a  ful ly   labeled   sketch  of  it.  Also 
obtain  an  expression  for  the  PSD  Sxx (jω),  and  draw  a  fully  labeled  sketch  of  it. 

(c)  (6  points)  With  the  properties  of  y(t) speciﬁed as  in (b),  is  y(t)  ergodic  in  mean  value? 
Be  sure  to  give  a  reason  for  your  answer!  Also,  is  x(t)  ergodic  in  mean  value?  Again, 
describe  your  reasoning.  If  you  are  able  to  evaluate  either  of  the  following  integrals  on 
the  basis  of  your  answers  here,  please  do  so: �  T
1 
lim 
�  T
T →∞  2T  −T 
1 
lim 
T →∞  2T  −T 
where y(t) and Θ here should be interpreted as the speciﬁc values taken by these quantities 
in  a particular  experiment  (we  could have used other  symbols, but  it would have  required 
more  notational  eﬀort  and  may  not  have  ended  up  any  clearer!). 

y(t) cos(wo t + Θ) dt , 

y(t) dt  ,

Problem 2  (30  points) 

� 
�	
Let  y [n]  be  a  wide-sense  stationary  (WSS)  process  with  autocorrelation  function 
Ryy [m] = 9  δ [m] − αδ [m − 1] − αδ [m + 1] 

. 

where  α > 0. 

(a)  (3  points)  What  is  the  largest	 value  α  can  take?  Explain  your  reasoning.  If  α  is  in-
creased  towards  its maximum  value,  does  the  power  of  the  signal  shift  to  lower  or  higher 
frequencies? 

(b)  (4  points)  Determine  the  following  (expressed  in  terms  of  α,  if  necessary): 

(i)	 E {y [n]}  and  E {y2 [n]}; 
(ii)  the  correlation  coeﬃcient  ρ  between  y [4]  and  y [5]. 

(c)  (4 points) Suppose we are told that we will be given the measurement y [4], and we want to 
ﬁnd  the  linear  minimum  mean-square-error  (LMMSE)  estimator  of  y [5]  in  terms  of  y [4]. 
Find  the  estimator,  and  determine  the  associated  (minimum)  mean  square  error  (MSE). 

(d)  (8  points)  Suppose  x[n] = y [n] + w[n],  where  w[n]  is  a  white  process  that  is  uncorrelated 
with  y [ · ]  and  has  power  spectral  density  Sww (ejΩ ) = 9α2 .  Determine  the  power  spectral 
density  Sxx(ejΩ )  and  show  that  it  can  be written  in  the  form 

Sxx (ejΩ ) = K (1 − β e−jΩ )(1 − β ejΩ ) 

for  K  and  β  that  you  should  determine  (expressed  in  terms  of  α,  if  necessary).  Also 
determine  the  cross-power  spectral  density  Syx(ejΩ ) in  terms  of  α. 
produces the LMMSE estimate y�[n] of y [n] in terms of measurements of the entire process 
(e)  (5  points)  Determine  the  frequency  response  H (ejΩ )  of  the  noncausal  Wiener  ﬁlter  that 
x[ · ]. 
(f )  (6 points) Determine the frequency response G(ejΩ ) of the causal  Wiener ﬁlter that at time 
prediction  of  the  measurement   at  the  next  step,  i.e.,  an  LMMSE  estimate  �x[n + 1]  of 
n  uses measurements  of  x[k ]  for  all  present  and  past  times  k ≤ n  to  produce  an  LMMSE 
x[n + 1].  Also  determine  the  associated  MSE.
