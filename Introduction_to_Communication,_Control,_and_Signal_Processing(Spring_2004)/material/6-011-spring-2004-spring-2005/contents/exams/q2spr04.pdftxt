Everything  on  the  notes  must  be  in  your  original  handwriting  (i.e.,  material  cannot  be 
xeroxed  from  solutions,  tables,  books,  etc). 
You  have  two  hours  for  this  exam. 
Calculators  are  NOT  allowed. 
We  will  NOT  provide  a  table  of  transforms. 
There  are  4  problems  on  the  exam  with  the  percentage  for  each  part  and  the  total  per¬≠
centage  for  each  problem  as  indicated.  Note  that  the  problems  do  not  all  have  the  same

total  percentage. 

The  problems  are  not  in  order  of  diÔ¨Éculty.  We  recommend  that  you  read  through  all  the

problems,  then  do  the  problems  in  whatever  order  suits  you  best. 
Please  be  neat‚Äîwe  cannot  grade  what  we  cannot  decipher. 
We  tried  to  provide  ample  space  for  you  to  write  in.  However,  the  amount  of  space 
provided  is  not  an  indication  of  the  length  of  the  explanation  required.  Short,  to  the 
point  explanations  are  preferred  to  long  ones  that  show  little  understanding.

All  work  and  answers  must  be  in  the  space  provided  on  the  exam  booklet.  You  are  welcome 
to  use  scratch  pages  that  we  provide  but  when  you  hand  in  the  exam  we  will  not  accept  any 
pages  other  than  the  exam  booklet.  There  will  be  absolutely  no  exceptions. 

Exam  Grading 

In  grading  all  of  the  6.011  exams  we  will  be  focusing  on  your  level  of  understanding  of  the 
material  associated  with  each  problem.  When  we  grade  each  part  of  a  problem  we  will  do  our 
best  to  assess,  from  your work,  your  level  of  understanding.  On  each  part  of  an  exam  question 
we will  also  indicate  the percentage  of  the  total  exam  grade  represented by  that part,  and  your 
numerical  score  on  the  exam  will  then  be  calculated  accordingly. 
Our  assessment  of  your  level  of  understanding  will  be  based  upon  what  is  given  in  your 
solution.  A  correct  Ô¨Ånal  answer  with  no  explanation  will  not  receive  full  credit,  and  may  even 
receive no  credit at all.  An  incorrect Ô¨Ånal answer having a  solution and  explanation  that  shows 
excellent  understanding  quite  likely  will  receive  full  (or  close  to  full)  credit.

(d)  (xx%) We assume that the state variables are not directly measureable but both the input

Consider a digital communication system  in which an i.i.d.  bit stream s[n] of ones and zeros 
is  transmitted  over  a  faulty,  memoryless  channel  with  ones  and  zeroes  equally  probable.  The 
probability  of  a  one  being  received  as  a  zero  is  1/8  and  the  probability  of  a  zero  being  received 
as  a  one  is  1/4.  This  type  of  channel  is  referred  to  as  a  binary  memoryless  channel  and  is 
depicted  in  Figure  3-1.
