•	 Put  your  name  on  each   page  of  this  booklet.  Specify  your  recitation  instructor  and  your 
recitation time.

•  This  is  a  closed  book  exam,  but  three  8

They  can be  as  big  as  8 1
or  two  sides  of  each,  but  only  three  sheets  are  allowed. 
•	 Everything  on  the  notes  must  be  in  your  original  handwriting  (i.e.,  material  cannot  be 
xeroxed  from  solutions,  tables,  books,  etc.). 
•	 You  have  two  hours  for  this  exam. 
•	 Calculators  are  NOT  allowed. 
•	 We  will  NOT  provide  a  table  of  transforms. 
•	 There  are  4  problems  on the  exam  with  the  percentage  for  each  part  and  the  total  per-
centage  for  each  problem  as  indicated.  Note  that  the  problems  do  not  all  have  the  same 
total  percentage. 
•	 Make  sure  you  have  seen all  ?  numbered  sides  of  this  answer  booklet. 
•	 The problems  are not  in  order  of  diﬃculty.  We  recommend  that  you  read  through  all  the 
problems,  then do  the  problems  in whatever  order  suits  you  best. 
•	 We  tried  to  provide  ample  space  for  you  to  write  in.  However,  the  space  provided  is  not 
an  indication  of  the  length  of  the  explanation  required.  Short,  to  the  point,  explanations 
are  preferred  to  long  ones  that  show  no  understanding. 
•	 Please  be  neat—we  cannot  grade  what  we  cannot  decipher. 

All  work  and  answers  must  be  in  the  space  provided  on  the  exam  booklet.  You  are  welcome 
to  use  scratch  pages  that  we  provide,  but  when  you  hand  in  the  exam  we  will  not  accept  any 
pages  other  than  the  exam  booklet.  There  will  be  absolutely  no  exceptions. 

Exam   Grading  

As  in the  ﬁrst  exam,  in grading  all  of  the  6.011  exams  we  will  be  focusing  on your  level  of 
understanding  of  the  material  associated  with  each  problem.  When  we  grade  each  part  of  a 
problem we will do our best to assess, from your work, your level of understanding.  On each part 
of  an exam  question we  will  also  indicate  the  percentage  of  the  total  exam  grade  represented 
by  that  part,  and  your  numerical  score  on the  exam  will  then be  calculated  accordingly. 
Our  assessment  of  your  level  of  understanding  will  be  based  upon  what  is  given  in  your 
solution.  A  correct  answer with  no  explanation will  not  receive  full credit,  and may  not  receive 
much—if any.  An  incorrect ﬁnal answer having a  solution and explanation  that  shows excellent 
understanding  quite  likely  will  receive  full  (or  close  to  full)  credit.

to  convey  a  message  sequence  a[n].  At  the  receiver,  a  sequence  b[n]  is  obtained  by  sampling 
s(t)  at  integer  multiples  of  T ,  i.e.,  the  receiver’s  output  sequence  is  b[n] = s(nT ). 
Given below are two possible choices for P (jω), the Fourier transform of the pulse shape p(t). 
For  each  choice,  specify  whether  there  are  values  of  T  for  which  there  will  be  no  intersymbol 
interference  (ISI),  i.e.,  whether  there  are  values  of  T  for  which  b[n] =  ca[n]  for  all  a[n] and  n, 
with  c  being  a  constant.  If  your  answer  for  a  particular  P (jω)  is  “yes”,  specify  all  possible

A signal  s[n]  to  be  retrieved  from  storage  is  sub ject  to  errors  due  to  faulty  electronics.  The 
retrieved  signal  r [n]  can be  written as 

r [n] = s[n] + e[n]
