FINAL  EXAM 
Tuesday,  December  16,  9  AM  –  12  PM 

•	 Put  your  name  on  each  page  of  this  booklet.  Specify  your  recitation  instructor  and  your 
recitation  time. 
�� 
2 ×  11��  sheets  of  notes  (both  sides)  are  allowed. 
This  is  a  closed  book  exam,  but  ﬁve  8

or  as  small  as  you’d  like  and  you  can  write  on  one  side

or  two  sides  of  each,  but  only  ﬁve  sheets  are  allowed. 
•	 Everything  on  the  notes  must  be  in  your  original  handwriting  (i.e.,  material  cannot  be 
xeroxed  from  solutions,  tables,  books,  etc). 
You  have  three  hours  for  this  exam. 
• 
• 
Calculators  are  NOT  allowed. 
•	 We  will  NOT  provide  a  table  of  transforms. 
•	 There  are  6  problems  on  the  exam  with  the  percentage  for  each  part  and  the  total  per­
centage  for  each  problem  as  indicated.  Note  that  the  problems  do  not  all  have  the  same 
total  percentage. 
•	 Make  sure  you  have  seen  all  22  numbered  sides  of  this  answer  booklet. 
•	 The  problems  are  not  in  order  of  diﬃculty.  We  recommend  that  you  read  through  all  the 
problems,  then  do  the  problems  in  whatever  order  suits  you  best. 
•	 We  tried  to  provide  ample  space  for  you  to  write  in.  However,  the  space  provided  is  not 
an  indication  of  the  length  of  the  explanation  required.  Short,  to  the  point,  explanations 
are  preferred  to  long  ones  that  show  no  understanding. 
•	 Please  be  neat—we  can’t  grade  what  we  can’t  decipher. 
All work and answers must be  in the  space provided on the  exam booklet.  You are welcome 
to  use  scratch  pages  that  we  provide  but  when  you  hand  in  the  exam  we  will  not  accept  any 
pages  other  than  the  exam  booklet.  There  will  be  absolutely  no  exceptions. 

Grading  on  the  Final  Exam: 
As  with  the  other  exams,  in  grading  the  ﬁnal  exam  we  will  be  focusing  on  your  level  of  under­
standing  of  the material  associated  with  each  problem.  When we  grade  each  part  of  a  problem 
we  will  do  our  best  to  assess,  from  your  work,  your  level  of  understanding.  On  each  part  of  an 
exam  question we will  also  indicate  the  percentage  of  the  total  exam  grade  represented  by  that 
part,  and  your  numerical  score  on  the  exam  will  then  be  calculated  accordingly. 
Our  assessment  of  your  level  of  understanding  will  be  based  upon  what  is  given  in  your 
solution.  A  correct  answer with  no  explanation will  not  receive  full  credit,  and may  not  receive 
much–if  any.  An  incorrect  ﬁnal  answer  having  a  solution  and  explanation  that  shows  excellent 
understanding  quite  likely  will  receive  full  (or  close  to  full)  credit.

Graded  Exams  and  Final  Course  Grade: 
Graded  exams  and  the  ﬁnal  course  grade  can  be  picked  up  after  1  p.m.  on Thursday,

be  sure  to  address  it  properly and with  enough  postage.  Also,  we’ll  guarantee  that  we’ll 
put  it  into  the  proper  mailbox  but  won’t  guarantee  anything  beyond  that.  Please  look  over 
the  grading  of  the  exam  before  leaving . We  will  not  consider  any  regrading  of  the  exam once 
you  take  it  away.

Consider  a  binary  hypothesis  testing  problem  in  which  a  receiver  observes  a  random  variable 
R.  Based  on  this  observation  the  receiver  decides  which  one  of  two  hypotheses  —  denoted  by 
H0  and  H1  —  to  declare  as  true.  The  receiver  can  be  tuned  to  operate  on  any  point  on  the 
Receiver  Operating  Characteristic  (ROC).  The  ROC  for  this  receiver  is  given  by  P D  = �PF A , 
where  PD  = P (‘H1 ’ H1 )  and  PF A  = P (‘H1 ’ H0 ).  The  probability  of  error  Pe  of  the  receiver  is
