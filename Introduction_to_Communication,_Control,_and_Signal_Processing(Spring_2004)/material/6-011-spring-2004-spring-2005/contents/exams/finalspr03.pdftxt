Your  Full   Name:


Recitation  Instructor  &  Time:


•	 Write  your  name  in  the  space  above,  because  we  will  be  collecting  your  question  booklet  in 
addition to you answer booklet but will return it to you when you collect your answer booklet. 
•	 This  is  a  closed  book  exam,  but  you  may  use  6  sheets  of  notes  (both  sides). 
•	 Calculators  are  allowed,  but  probably  will  not  be  useful. 
•	 There  are  ﬁve   problems  on  the  exam,  with  point  distributions  of  15,   20,  25,   15,  25, for 
a  total  of  100  points.  We  have  also  marked  for  each  problem  a  rough  guide  to  the  number 
of minutes  you would  spend  on  the  problem  if  you were  dividing  your  time  according  to  the 
points  on  the  problem.  The  time  you  choose  to  spend  may  diﬀer,  of  course,  based  on  which 
problems  you  are  more  or  less  comfortable  with.  However,  budget  your  time  carefully; 
if  you  are  stuck  on  a  problem,  try  and  move  on  to  another  part  or  another  problem,  then 
return  if  you  have  time  later.  Avoid  spending  inordinately  longer  than  the  prorated  time  on 
any  particular  problem. 
•	 Be  clear  and  precise  in  your  reasoning  and  show   all   relevant   work.   The  grade  on  each 
problem  is  based  on  our  best  assessment  of  your  level  of  understanding,  as  reﬂected  by  what 
you  have written.  A  correct ﬁnal  answer  does not  guarantee  full  credit;  nor does  an  incorrect 
ﬁnal  answer  necessarily mean  loss  of  all  credit. 
•	 If  we  can’t  read   it,  we  can’t/won’t  grade   it!   So  please  write  neatly  and  legibly. 
•	 You  are  to hand  in  only  the  ANSWER  booklet  that  is  supplied.  No  additional   pages  
will  be  considered  in  the  grading.  You  may  want  to  ﬁrst  work  things  through  in  the 
blank  areas  of  this  question  booklet  or  on  scratch  paper,  and  then  neatly  transfer  to  the 
answer  booklet  the  work  you  would  like  us  to  look  at.  Let  us  know  if  you  need  additional 
scratch  paper. 

Problem  1  [15   points,   20   minutes] 

Provide brief answers, with appropriate  justiﬁcations or  computations,  for  each of  the  following 
parts. 

(a)  Can a  causal LTI  state-space  system  that  is not  asymptotically  stable become asymptotically 
stable  under  appropriate  LTI  state  feedback  even  if  some  of  its modes  are  unreachable? 

(b)  Consider	 a  continuous-time  zero-mean  wide-sense-stationary  (WSS)  random  process  x(t) 
whose power spectral density Sxx (jω) is constant  at the value N0  > 0 for frequencies |ω | < ωm 
and  0  outside  this  band.  By  considering  the  autocorrelation  function  Rxx (τ )  of  this  process, 
one  can  see  that  for  an  appropriately  chosen T  the  samples  x(nT )  of  the  process  constitute  a 
discrete-time  zero-mean  WSS  white   process.  Determine  an  appropriate  T ,  and  specify  what 
the  variance  of  the  corresponding  x(nT ) is. 

(c)  Consider  a  minimum-error-probability  hypothesis  test  to  select  between  two  Gaussians  of 
the  same  variance  σ2  but  diﬀerent  means  µ1  and  µ2  > µ1 ,  based  on  a  single  measurement 
drawn  from  one  of  these  densities  with  equal  probability.  Use  the  standard Q(x)  function  to 
express  the  conditional  probability  of  correctly  detecting  the  Gaussian  of  mean  µ2 , and  also 
�  ∞ 
the  conditional  probability  of  falsely  detecting  this  Gaussian.  Recall  that 
Q(x) =  √ 
1 
−t2 /2 dt . 
e 
2π  x 

(d)  If  pulse-amplitude  modulation  is  used  to  communicate  a  general  discrete-time  (DT)  signal 
over  a  continuous-time  lowpass  channel whose  transmission  is bandlimited  to  |ω | < ωm , what 
is the highest symbol repetition rate that can be used before  information about the DT signal 
is  lost  in  the  process? 

Problem  2  [20   points,   40   minutes] 

Suppose  the  zero-mean  wide-sense  stationary  (WSS)  process  x[n]  is  obtained  by  applying  a 
zero-mean WSS white  process w[n] with  power  spectral  density  (PSD) Sww   (ejΩ ) = σ2  to  the  input 
of  a  (stable,  causal)  ﬁlter  with  system  function M (z ) = 1 − 3z
−1
. 
(a)  If Sxx (ejΩ ) denotes the PSD of x[n], ﬁnd Sxx (z ).  Also ﬁnd the autocovariance function Cxx [m] 
of the process x[n], the variance of the random variable x[n+ 1], and the correlation coeﬃcient 
ρ  between  x[n] and  x[n + 1]. 

(b)  Specify  the  linear  minimum  mean-square-error  (LMMSE)  estimator  of  x[n + 1]  based  on  a 
measurement of x[n], and compute  the associated mean-square-error  (MSE).  Is  this MSE  less 
than  the  variance  of  x[n + 1]  that  you  computed  in  (a)? 

(c)  Find the system  function F (z ) of a stable and causal ﬁlter whose  inverse 1/F (z )  is also stable 
and  causal,  and  such  that

Sxx (z ) = F (z )F (z

Be  careful  with  this  part,  because  errors  here  will  propagate  to  the  next  part!


(d)  Find  the  system  function  of  the  causal  Wiener  ﬁlter  that  generates  an  estimate  of  x[n + 1] 
based  on  al l   past   x[k ],  k  ≤  n,  i.e.,  ﬁnd  the  system  function  of  the  one-step  predictor.  Do 
you  expect  that  the MSE  for  this  case  will  be  less  than  or  equal  to  or  greater  than  what  you 
computed  in  (b)?  (You  don’t  need  to  actually  determine  the MSE;  we  are  only  interested  in 
what  your  intuition  is  for  the  situation.) 

Problem  3  [25   points,   45   minutes] 

A  particular  causal  ﬁrst-order  discrete-time  LTI  system  is  governed  by  a  model  in  state-space 
form: 

q [n + 1] = 3q [n] + x[n] + d[n]

 Assume  the  measurement  noise  is  uncorrelated  with  the  system  disturbance: 
E ( v [n]d[k ] ) = 0  for  all  n,  k . 

(a)  Specify  which  of  the  following  equations  you  would  implement  as  your  (causal)  observer, 
explaining  your  reasoning.  In  each  case,  "  denotes  the  observer  gain. 
(i)  q�[n + 1] = 3q�[n] + x[n] + d[n] − " ( y [n] − 2q�[n] − v [n] ) . 
(ii)  q�[n + 1] = 3q�[n] + x[n] − " ( y [n] − 2q�[n] − v [n] ) . 
(iii)  q�[n + 1] = 3q�[n] + x[n] − " ( y [n] − 2q�[n] ) . 
(iv)  q�[n + 1] = 3q�[n] − " ( y [n] − 2q�[n] ) . 
(v)  q�[n + 1] = 3q�[n] − " ( y [n] − 2q�[n] − v [n] ) . 
(vi)  Something  other  than  the  above  (specify). 
(b)  Obtain  a  state-space  model  for  the  observer  error,  q�[n] = q [n] − q�[n],  writing  it  in  the  form

Problem  5  [25   points,   45   minutes] 

A signal X [n]  that we will  be measuring  for n = 1, 2  is  known  to  be  generated  according  to  one 
of  the  following  two  hypotheses: 

Hno   :  X [n] =  W [n] 
Hyes   :  X [n] =  s[n] + W [n] 
where  s[1],  s[2]  are  speciﬁed  (deterministic)  numbers,  with  0  < s[i]  ≤  1 for  i = 1, 2,  and  where 
W [1], W [2]  are  i.i.d.  random  variables  uniformly   distributed   in  the  interval  [−1, 1]  (and  hence with 
mean 0 and variance
 1 
3 ).  Given measurements x[1] and x[2] of X [1] and X [2] respectively, we would

like  to  decide  between  the  hypotheses  Hno   and Hyes . 
Most  of  part  (c)  below  can  be  done  independently  of  parts  (a)  and  (b). 

(a)  One  strategy  for  processing  the  measurements  is  to  only  look  at  a  linear  combination  of  the 
measurements,  of  the  form 

r = g [1]x[1] + g [2]x[2] . 
To  analyze  decision  schemes  that  are  based  on  consideration  of  the  number  r ,  consider  the 
random  variable 

R = g [1]X [1] + g [2]X [2] . 
Determine  the  mean  and  variance  of  R under  each  of  the  hypotheses,  and  note  that  the 
variance  does  not  depend  on  which  hypothesis  applies.  (Note:  you  do  not  need  to  ﬁnd 
the  densities  of  R under  the  two  hypotheses  in  order  to  ﬁnd  these  conditional  means  and 
variances!) 
Now  choose  g [1]  and  g [2]  to  maximize  the  relative  distance  between  these  means,  where 
“relative”  signiﬁes  that  the  distance  is  to  be  measured  relative  to  the  standard  deviation  of 
R under  hypothesis Hno   (or,  equivalently,  under Hyes ).  Equivalently, maximize  the  following 
“signal-to-noise”  ratio  (SNR):  � 
�2 
E [R|Hyes ] − E [R|Hno ] 
|H
variance(R no )
(b)  In  the  particular  case  where	 s[1]  =  s[2]  =  1,  which  we  shall  focus  on  for  the  rest  of  this 
problem,  it  turns  out  that  the  choice  g [1]  =  g [2]  =  c will  serve,  for  any  nonzero  constant  c, 
to  maximize  the  SNR  in  (a).  Taking  c =  3,  draw  fully  labeled  sketches  of  the  conditional 
densities  of  R under  each  of  the  hypotheses,  i.e.,  sketches  of  fR|H (r |Hno ) and  fR|H (r |Hyes ). 
Suppose  now  that  the  prior  probabilities  on  the  two  hypotheses  are  p(Hno ) = 2 
3 and  hence 
p(Hyes ) = 1 
3 .
 Specify  a  decision  rule  that,  on  the  basis  of  knowledge  that  R =  r ,  decides 

between  Hno   and  Hyes   with  minimum  probability  of  error.  Also  compute  the  probability  of 
error associated with this decision rule.  (It will probably help you to shade on the appropriate 
sketch  the  regions  corresponding  to  the  conditional  probability  of  a  false  “yes”  and  to  the 
conditional  probability  of  a  false  “no”.) 

.

(c)  If  we  did  not  hastily  commit  ourselves  to  working  with  a  scalar  measurement  obtained  by 
taking  a  linear  combination  of  the  measurements  x[1]  and  x[2],  we  might  perhaps  have  done 
� 
� 
� 
� 
better.  Accordingly,  ﬁrst  sketch  or  fully  describe  the  conditional  densities 
fX [1],X [2]|H  x[1], x[2] | Hyes  
fX [1],X [2]|H  x[1], x[2] | Hno  

and 

for  the case where s[1] = s[2] = 1.  Then specify a decision rule that will pick between the two 
hypotheses  with  minimum  probability  of  error,  on  the  basis  of  knowledge  that  X [1]  =  x[1] 
2
and  X [2]  =  x[2],  and  still  with  the  prior  probabilities  speciﬁed  in  (b),  namely  p(Hno ) =  3 
and  hence  p(Hyes ) =  1 .  Determine  the  probability  of  error  associated with  this  decision  rule, 
3 
and  compare  with  your  result  in  (b).
