Caution:  Make  sure  you  move  on  to  Problem  2  if  you  ﬁnd  yourself  taking  too  long  or 
getting  stuck  in  part  1(d)  below. 

1(d) (10 points) With all quantities as previously deﬁned, and assuming µx  = 0 for simplicity, 
suppose  what  you  can  measure  is  q [n] =  y [n] + v [n]  for  all  n,  where  v [n]  is  (zero­mean)  white 
noise of intensity σv 
2 , and is uncorrelated with the process x[k ].  Compute the frequency response 
estimate  �x[n + 2]  as  output  at  time  n.  Explicitly  check  that  your  answer  reduces  to  something 
W (ejΩ ) of the non­causal Wiener ﬁlter that has q [n] as input at time n and produces the LMMSE 
that  you  expect  in  the  case  that  σ2  = 0.

Let  g [n] = x[n + 2]

Sgq  ejΩ 
W ejΩ = 
Sqq  (ejΩ ) 
Since  y  and  v  are  uncorrelated  (since  x  and  v  are  uncorrelated),  we  have: 
Sqq  = Syy  + Svv  = HH ∗σ2  + σ2 
v 
x
Since  g  and  v  are  uncorrelated,  we  also  have  that: 

Sgq  = Sgy 

Making  use  of  the  fact  that  g [n] = x[n + 2],  we  can  say: 
Sgy  = e 2jΩSxy  = e 2jΩH ∗σ2 
x

Putting  it  all  together,  we  have:

Which  is  reasonable because:  This  is  the  inverse  system  to  get x[n]  from  y [n],  then  advance 
by  2  steps,  to  get  x[n + 2].

2(b)  (10 points) For each of  the  following  functions R[m],  state whether or not  it can be  the 
autocorrelation  function  of  a  DT WSS  random  process,  where  m  denotes  the  lag.  If  it  cannot 
be,  explain  why  not.  If  it  can  be,  explain  in  detail  how  you  would  obtain  such  a  process  by 
appropriately  ﬁltering  a  Bernoulli  process  that  takes  values  at  each  time  instant  of  +1  or  −1, 
with  equal  probability. 
(i)  R[m] = 1  for m = 0,  0.7  for  |m = 1,  and  0  elsewhere. 
| 
(ii)  R[m] = 2  for m = 0,  −1  for  m = 1,  and  0  elsewhere.

2(b)(i)  R[m] = 1  for m = 0,  0.7  for  |m = 1,  and  0  elsewhere:

Begin  work  here:


There  are  three  easy  criteria  we  can  check  for  this  candidate:

1.  Is  R[m]  an  even  function  of m,  i.e.  is  R[m] = R[−m]?  YES 
2.  Is  |R[m]| ≤ |R[0] ?  YES

3.  Is  the  PSD  always  non­negative?  NO,  see  work  below.

ejΩ  + e−jΩ 
F (R[m]) = S (ejΩ ) = 1 + 1.4

In  the  above  expression,  S (ejΩ )  can  be  negative  for  some  Ω,  and  therefore  it  cannot  be  a 
valid  PSD. 

= 1 + 1.4 cos Ω 

Thus,  R[m]  CANNOT  be  a  valid  autocorrelation  function.

2(b)(ii)  R[m] = 2  for m = 0,  −1  for  m = 1,  and  0  elsewhere:

Begin  work  here:


There  are  three  easy  criteria  we  can  check  for  this  candidate:

1.  Is  R[m]  an  even  function  of m,  i.e.  is  R[m] = R[−m]?  YES 
2.  Is  |R[m]| ≤ |R[0] ?  YES

3.  Is  the  PSD  always  non­negative?  YES,  see  work  below. 
� 
� 
ejΩ  + e−jΩ 
F (R[m]) = S (ejΩ ) = 2 + 2 
2 
In  the  above  expression,  S (ejΩ )  is  non­negative  for  all  Ω,  and  therefore  it  CAN  be  a  valid 
PSD.  Thus,  R[m]  CAN  be  a  valid  autocorrelation  function. 

= 2 + 2cosΩ

To  actually  demonstrate  that  it  is  valid,  we  now  show  how  to  generate  a  process  with  this 
autocorrelation  function,  by  appropriate  LTI  ﬁltering  of  a  Bernoulli  process,  with  zero  mean 
and  autocorrelation  δ [m].  We  need  to  ﬁnd  h[m]  such  that  h[m] ∗ h[−m] = R[m].  The  following 
ﬁlter  will  work  for  any  integer  value  of  l: 
h[n] = ± (δ [n − l] − δ [n − l − 1])

You  can  also  obtain  an  expression  for  the  ﬁlter  H (ejΩ )  in  the  frequency  domain  as: 

H (jΩ)H (−jΩ) = 2 + 2 cos Ω 
H (jΩ) = 1 − e−jΩ
