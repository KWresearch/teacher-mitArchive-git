Problem 1 (35 points)

The three parts of this problem — (a), (b), and (c) — are somewhat independent, so if you get
stuck on one part, move to another!

The ﬁgure above shows a continuous-time ﬁlter implemented using: (i) a C/D converter
that samples the CT input at integer multiples of T ; (ii) a DT LTI ideal lowpass ﬁlter with
frequency response H (ejΩ ) whose cutoﬀ frequency is π
4 ; and (iii) an ideal (i.e., bandlimited
interpolating) D/C converter operating with reconstruction interval T .

(a) Assume xc(t) is bandlimited to π × 104 , i.e., assume Xc (jω) = 0 for |ω | ≥ π × 104 . Also
suppose (1/T ) = 8× 104 . First determine whether xc(t) is sampled without aliasing. Then
express yc(t) in terms of xc (t), explaining your reasoning in detail. Note: We are not
asking for yc (t) to be expressed as a function of time; just express its relation to xc(t).

(b) Suppose that Xc (jω) is as shown in the ﬁgure below, and that now (1/T ) = 2 × 104 .
Again determine whether xc (t) is sampled without aliasing. Then draw a fully labeled
sketch of Yc(jω).

Quiz 2, November 24, 2004

(c) Suppose all we know about the set of possible input signals xc (t) is that they are con-
strained to be bandlimited to π × 104 . How small can the sampling rate (1/T ) be while
still ensuring that the system performs a CT LTI ﬁltering operation on this class of in-
puts? Completely specify this LTI ﬁltering operation, either in words or by drawing a
fully labeled sketch of the eﬀective CT frequency response Hef f (jω).

Problem 2 (15 points)

The ﬁgure below shows a continuous-time ﬁlter implemented in the familiar way, i.e., using:
(i) a C/D converter that samples the CT input at integer multiples of T ; (ii) a DT LTI ﬁlter with
frequency response H (ejΩ ); and (iii) an ideal (i.e., bandlimited interpolating) D/C converter
operating with reconstruction interval T .
Suppose H (ejΩ ) = e−j 0.4 Ω .
