has pages numbered up to 7.

• You are to hand in only this ANSWER booklet. No additional pages will be
considered in the grading. You may want to ﬁrst work things through in the blank areas
of the question booklet or on scratch paper, and then neatly transfer to thisr booklet the
work you would like us to look at. Let us know if you need additional scratch paper.

Problem 1 (20 points)

The input to a particular stable LTI ﬁlter with frequency response

H (ejΩ ) =

1
1 − 1
2 e−jΩ

is a DT wide-sense stationary (WSS) process w[ · ] whose power spectral density (PSD) is
Sww (ejΩ ) = 9 for all Ω. Denote the output of the system at time n by y [n].

1(a) (5 points) Find a ﬁrst-order diﬀerence equation relating the input and output of the
(cid:1)
system, and also explicitly determine the unit-sample response h[n] of the system. (Do this
h[n] and
carefully, as other answers will depend on it!) As a check, explicitly compute
compare the value you get with what you should expect for the given H (ejΩ ). Is the system
causal?

2

1(b) (5 points) Determine the mean E {y [n]} = µy and the autocorrelation E {y [n+m]y [n]} =
Ryy [m] of the WSS output process y [ · ]. Your answer for the autocorrelation function should
be written out explicitly, not left as an integral or sum. If you’ve done things correctly, you
should ﬁnd that the variance of y [n] is 12; verify this explicitly.

You may ﬁnd it helpful to recall the following identity for geometric series:

1 + α + · · · + αm−1 =

1 − αm
1 − α

.

one-step predictor for the process y [ · ]. This predictor forms the LMMSE estimator (cid:2)y [n + 1]
1(c) (10 points) Specify completely the linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) causal
for y [n + 1], using all values of y [k ] for k ≤ n. One way to do this is using your input-output
equation from (a) to conjecture the form of this predictor, and then to verify your conjecture
using the orthogonality condition that characterizes LMMSE estimation. Another way is to
design an appropriate causal Wiener ﬁlter.

Use either of the above approaches to ﬁnd the predictor, showing the main steps of your
[If you have time at the end of the exam, then for 3 points of extra credit,
calculation.
ﬁnd the predictor using the other way too, and check that you get the same answer either
way.]

Using either of the approaches mentioned above, determine the minimum mean square error
(MMSE) associated with the predictor. Could the correct answer for the MMSE be larger
than 12?

Problem 2 (24 points)

Summarizing the problem statement, the received signal is

r [n] = Ap[n] + v [n] ,

where A is a random variable that is chosen by the transmitter; the receiver only knows the
mean µA and variance σ2
A of A. Assume A is uncorrelated with the wide-sense stationary
(WSS) white-noise process v [ · ] whose intensity is given to be σ2
v , i.e., Svv (ejΩ ) = σ2
v for all
(cid:3)
Ω. Also take p[ · ] to be a known signal of ﬁnite energy

E =

p2 [n] .

With f [n] denoting the unit sample response of the receiver ﬁlter, we deﬁne

where

B =

f [n]v [−n]) = αA + V ,

V =

f [n]v [−n] .

Also

α =

f [n]p[−n] ,
(cid:3)

F =

f 2 [n] .

n

2(a) (4 points) Determine the mean and variance of V , and the cross-covariance σAV of A
and V . All your answers can be written in terms of σv and F .

8

2(b) (6 points) Determine the mean and variance of B , the cross-covariance σAB of A and B ,
and their correlation coeﬃcient ρAB , all expressed in terms of the problem parameters and
the simpliﬁed notation introduced above.

9

2(c) (4 points) Write down the LMMSE estimator of A that uses a measurement of B , i.e.,
(cid:2)A = γB + µ
ﬁnd γ and µ in
so as to minimize E [(A − (cid:2)A)2 ]. Again, your answers should be expressed in terms of the
problem parameters and the simpliﬁed notation introduced above.

10

2(d) (10 points) The minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) associated with the estimator in
2(c) can be written as

A (1 − ρ2
σ2
AB ) .

Express this in terms of the problem parameters and the simpliﬁed notation above, and note
that only α and F in your expression are aﬀected by how we choose the ﬁlter f [n]. Use your
expression to show clearly and careful ly that the MMSE is minimized if α2 /F is made as large
as possible

2(d) continued:

The Cauchy-Schwartz inequality can be used to show that

with equality if and only if

α2
F

≤ E ,

f [n] = c p[−n]

for any nonzero constant c, which we can take to be 1 without loss of generality here. Note
that with f [n] = p[−n], we get α = E = F . Using this, rewrite your expressions for the
minimum MMSE and for the constants γ and µ in the LMMSE estimator in 2(c), in terms
of just µA , σA , σv and E .

(Continued on next page .....)

12

2(d) continued further: As a check on your answers, explicitly verify that your rewritten
expressions on the preceding page behave reasonably as the parameters take various extreme
values (pick at least three sets of extreme cases to check).

13

Problem 3 (20 points)
Summarizing the problem statement, suppose under hypothesis H0 the random variable X
is distributed uniformly in the interval [−2, 2], while under hypothesis H1 it is distributed
uniformly in the interval [−1, 1]. The Neyman-Pearson (NP) decision rule announces ‘H1 ’ if
the likelihood ratio

Λ(x) =

fX |H (x|H1 )
fX |H (x|H0 )

exceeds a properly selected threshold η , i.e., if Λ(x) > η ; and announces ‘H0 ’ if the likelihood
ratio falls below the threshold, i.e., if Λ(x) < η .

3(a) (4 points) Sketch Λ(x) as a function of x for −2 < x < 2.

14

3(b) (6 points) For η ﬁxed at some value in each of the following ranges, specify PD and PF A :

1. η at some value strictly below 0.
2. η at some value strictly between 0 and 2.
3. η at some value strictly above 2.

15

3(c) (10 points) Suppose we choose η = 2. What is the probability that we get Λ(X ) = 2 if
H0 holds? And what is the probability we get Λ(X ) = 2 if H1 holds?

(Continued on next page .....)

16

3(c) continued: With η = 2, you should see from the above computations that we will never
get Λ(x) > η , but we might well get Λ(x) = η or Λ(x) < η . Suppose we still announce ‘H0 ’
when Λ(x) < η ; however, when Λ(x) = η we shall announce ‘H0 ’ with probability α, and
otherwise announce ‘H1 ’. What are PF A and PD with this randomized decision rule? Explain
carefully.

3(c) continued further: Draw the ROC that you get as α varies from 0 to 1, and also
include the three points on the ROC that you computed in 3(b).

Problem 4 (36 points)
4(a) (12 points) A DT zero-mean wide-sense-stationary (WSS) process e[ · ] has autocorrela-
tion function

sin(πm/3)
m
for m (cid:11)= 0, and Ree [0] = π/3. The process x[ · ] is deﬁned by the relation

Ree [m] =

x[n] = (−1)n e[n]

for all n. Show that x[ · ] is WSS, and sketch its power spectral density (PSD) Sxx(ejΩ ) in
the region |Ω| ≤ π . Is x[ · ] also jointly WSS with e[ · ]?

4(c) (12 points) The dynamics of a synchronous electric generator are governed by a model
of the form

d2 θ(t)
dt2 + β

dθ(t)
dt

+ α sin θ(t) = T (t)

where θ(t) is the (relative) angular position of the generator and T (t) is the (normalized)
external torque acting on it; the parameter α is positive, but β can be positive or negative.
Write a state-space model of this system. Then, assuming T (t) is constant at a positive value
T (t) = T , determine for what values of T the system will have:

(i) no equilibrium solutions;
(ii) one equilibrium solution with θ(t) = θ in the range [0, 2π ];
(iii) two equilibrium solutions with θ(t) = θ in the range [0, 2π ].

4(c) continued: Write down the two linearized models computed at the two equilibrium
solutions you found in part (iii) above, expressing them in the standard form

˙q(t) = Aq(t) + bx(t) .

4(c) continued further: Determine the reachability of each of the linearized models by
checking whether you can obtain an arbitrary closed-loop characteristic polynomial by LTI
state feedback.
