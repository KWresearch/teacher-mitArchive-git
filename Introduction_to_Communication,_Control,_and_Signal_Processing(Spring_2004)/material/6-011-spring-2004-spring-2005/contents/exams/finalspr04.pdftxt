FINAL  EXAM 
Tuesday, May  18th  from  9:00  AM  –  12:00  NOON 
2 ��×  11��  sheets  of  notes  (both  sides)  are  allowed.

•  This  is  a  closed  book  exam,  but  four  8

��
2 ×  11��  or  as  small  as  you’d  like  and  you  can  write  on  one  side 
1
They  can  be  as  big  as  8 
or  two  sides  of  each,  but  only  four  sheets  are  allowed. 
•	 Everything  on  the  notes  must  be  in  your  original  handwriting  (i.e.,  material  cannot  be 
xeroxed  from  solutions,  tables,  books,  etc).

• 
You  have  three  hours  for  this  exam.

Calculators  are  NOT  allowed. 
• 
•	 We  will  NOT  provide  a  table  of  transforms. 
•	 There  are  7  problems  on  the  exam  with  the  percentage  for  each  part  and  the  total  per­
centage  for  each  problem  as  indicated.  Note  that  the  problems  do  not  all  have  the  same 
total  percentage. 
•	 The  problems  are  not  in  order  of  diﬃculty.  We  recommend  that  you  read  through  all  the 
problems,  then  do  the  problems  in  whatever  order  suits  you  best. 
•	 Please  be  neat—we  cannot  grade  what  we  cannot  decipher. 
•	 We  tried  to  provide  ample  space  for  you  to  write  in.  However,  the  amount  of  space 
provided  is  not  an  indication  of  the  length  of  the  explanation  required.  Short,  to  the 
point  explanations  are  preferred  to  long  ones  that  show  little  understanding. 

All  work  and  answers  must  be  in  the  space  provided  on  the  exam  booklet.  You  are  welcome 
to  use  scratch  pages  that  we  provide  but  when  you  hand  in  the  exam  we  will  not  accept  any 
pages  other  than  the  exam  booklet.  There  will  be  absolutely  no  exceptions. 

Final  Exam  Grading 

As  with  the  other  exams,  in  grading  the  ﬁnal  exam  we  will  be  focusing  on  your  level  of  under­
standing  of  the material  associated  with  each  problem.  When we  grade  each  part  of  a  problem 
we  will  do  our  best  to  assess,  from  your  work,  your  level  of  understanding.  On  each  part  of  an 
exam  question we will  also  indicate  the  percentage  of  the  total  exam  grade  represented  by  that 
part,  and  your  numerical  score  on  the  exam  will  then  be  calculated  accordingly. 
Our  assessment  of  your  level  of  understanding  will  be  based  upon  what  is  given  in  your 
solution.  A  correct  ﬁnal  answer  with  no  explanation  will  not  receive  full  credit,  and may  even 
receive  no  credit  at  all.  An  incorrect  ﬁnal answer having a  solution  and explanation  that  shows 
excellent  understanding  quite  likely  will  receive  full  (or  close  to  full)  credit.

Graded  Exams  and  Final  Course  Grade: 
Graded  exams  and  the  ﬁnal  course  grade  can  be  picked  up  after  Monday,  May  24th,  between 
noon  and  3pm.  If  you  would  like  your  graded  exam  mailed  to  you,  please  leave  an  addressed, 
stamped  envelope  with  us  at  the  end  of  the  exam.  We’ll  use  the  envelope  as  is,  so  please  be 
sure  to  address  it  properly  and  with  enough  postage.  Also,  we’ll  guarantee  that  we’ll  put  it 
into  the  proper  mailbox  but  won’t  guarantee  anything  beyond  that.  Please  look  over  the 
grading  of  the  exam  before  leaving .  We  will  not  consider  any  regrading  of  the exam  once 
you  take  it  away. 

OUT  OF  CONSIDERATION  FOR  THE  6.011  STAFF,  UNDER  NO 
CIRCUMSTANCES WILL  THE  GRADE  BE  AVAILABLE  BY  PHONE  OR  EMAIL. 
PLEASE DON’T  EVEN  ASK.
