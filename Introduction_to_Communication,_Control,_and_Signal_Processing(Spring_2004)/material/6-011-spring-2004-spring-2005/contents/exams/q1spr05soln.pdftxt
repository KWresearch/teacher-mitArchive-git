Problem   1  (20  points) 

Suppose  x(t) =  y(t) cos(ωo t + Θ),  where:  y(t)  is  a  wide-sense  stationary  (WSS)  process 
with mean  µy  and  autocovariance  function Cyy (τ );  ωo  is  a  known  constant;  and Θ  is  a  random 
variable  that  is  independent of y( · ) and  is uniformly distributed  in  the  interval  [0, 2π ].  Do part 
(a)  below  especially  carefully,  because  (b)  and  (c)  depend  on  it  to  some  extent! 
You might  ﬁnd  it  helpful  in  one  or  more  parts  of  the  problem  to  recall  that 
[cos(A + B ) + cos(A − B )]  .

(a)  (8 points) Find the mean µx (t) and autocorrelation function E [x(t + τ )x(t)] of the process 
x( · ).  Also  ﬁnd  the  cross-correlation  function  E [y(t + τ )x(t)].  Explain  precisely  what 
features  of  your  answers  tell  you  that:  (i)  x( · )  is  a WSS  process;  and  (ii)  x( · ) and  y( · ) 
are  jointly WSS. 

Begin  work  for  Problem  1(a)  here: 
µx (t) =  E [y(t) cos(ω0 t + θ)]

Problem  1(a)  continued: 

Mean  µx (t) = 0 

Autocorrelation  function  E [x(t + τ )x(t)] =  Ryy (τ )  cos(ω0 τ )
2 

Cross-correlation  function  E [y(t + τ )x(t)] = 0 
x( · )  is WSS  because:  µx (t) = 0,doesn’t  depend  on  t;  and  E [x(t + τ )x(t)]  only  depends  on 
the  lag  τ , not  t. 

x( · ) and y( · ) are jointly WSS because:  y(t) is WSS too, and E [y(t + τ )x(t)] doesn’t depend 
on,  i.e.  vary  with,  t.

Ryy [m] = 9  δ [m] − αδ [m − 1] − αδ [m + 1] 
where  α  is  positive,  α > 0. 
(a)  (3  points)  What  is  the  maximum  value	 α  can  take?  Explain  your  reasoning.  If  α  is 
increased  towards  its  maximum  value,  does  the  power  of  the  signal  shift  to  lower  or 
higher  frequencies? 

. 

Begin  work  for  Problem  2(a): 
We  need  Syy (ejΩ ) = 9(1 − 2α cos(Ω)) ≥ 0,  so  α ≤  1  (and  > 0,  given).

with  y [ · ]  and  has  power  spectral  density  Sww (ejΩ ) = 9α2 .  Determine  the  power  spectral 
density  Sxx (ejΩ )  and  show  that  it  can  be  written  in  the  form 
Sxx (ejΩ ) = K (1 − β e−jΩ )(1 − β ejΩ ) 

for  K  and  β  that  you  should  determine  (expressed  in  terms  of  α,  if  necessary).  Also 
determine  the  cross-power  spectral  density  Syx (ejΩ )  in  terms  of  α. 

Begin  work  for  Problem  2(d): 
Since  y [·] and  w[·]  are  uncorrelated,  and  E [w[n]] = 0.

Yes,  for  β  = α, K  = 9. 

Ryx [m] = Ryy [m], since y and w are uncorrelated and E [w[n]] = 0, so Syx (ejΩ ) = Syy (ejΩ ) = 
9(1 − 2α cos(Ω)). 

Sxx (ejΩ ) = Syy (ejΩ ) + Sww (ejΩ ) = 9(1 − αe−jΩ  − αejΩ ) + 9α2
