They  can  be  as  big  as   8 1

or  two  sides  of  each,   but  only  two  sheets  are  allowed. 
•	 Everything   on  the  notes   must   be  in   your  original  handwriting   (i.e.,  material  cannot  be 
xeroxed  from   solutions,  tables,  books,  etc). 
•	 You   have  two   hours  for  this   exam.  
•	 Calculators   are  NOT  allowed.  
•	 We  will  NOT  provide   a  table  of transforms. 
•	 There  are  4  problems  on  the   exam  with  the  percentage  for  each  part  and   the   total  per(cid:173)
centage  for   each  problem   as   indicated.  Note  that  the  problems  do   not  all  have  the   same 
total  percentage.  
•	 The  problems  are  not  in  order  of  diﬃculty.  We  recommend   that  you   read   through  all  the 
problems,  then  do  the  problems  in  whatever   order  suits  you  best. 
•	 Please  be  neat—we   cannot   grade  what  we  cannot  decipher. 
•	 We  tried  to  provide   ample   space   for  you  to   write  in.  However,  the  amount  of  space 
provided  is  not  an  indication   of  the  length  of  the  explanation   required.   Short,  to   the 
point  explanations  are   preferred  to  long  ones  that  show   little  understanding. 

All  work  and  answers  must   be  in  the  space  provided   on  the  exam  booklet.  You  are   welcome 
to  use  scratch  pages  that  we  provide  but  when   you   hand   in  the  exam  we   will  not  accept  any 
pages   other  than  the  exam  booklet.   There  will  be  absolutely  no  exceptions. 

Exam  Grading 

In  grading  all  of  the  6.011  exams  we  will  be  focusing  on  your  level  of   understanding  of  the 
material  associated  with  each  problem.  When  we  grade  each  part  of   a   problem  we  will  do  our 
best  to  assess,  from   your  work,   your  level  of   understanding.  On   each   part  of  an  exam  question 
we  will  also  indicate   the  percentage   of   the  total   exam  grade  represented  by  that  part,  and  your 
numerical  score   on  the  exam   will   then  be  calculated   accordingly. 
Our  assessment  of  your  level   of  understanding  will  be  based   upon  what  is  given  in  your 
solution.  An  correct  ﬁnal   answer  with  no  explanation  will  not  receive  full  credit,  and  may  even 
receive  no  credit  at   all.   An  incorrect  ﬁnal  answer  having  a  solution  and   explanation  that  shows 
excellent  understanding  quite  likely   will  receive  full  (or  close  to  full)  credit.

x(t) and   y(t) are  two   WSS random   processes. The  autocorrelation  function  of   x(t) is  Rxx (τ ) =  e−|τ | .
