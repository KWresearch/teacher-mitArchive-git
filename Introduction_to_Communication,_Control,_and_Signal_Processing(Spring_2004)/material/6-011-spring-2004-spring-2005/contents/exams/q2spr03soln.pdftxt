QUIZ  2,  Spring  2003 
Solutions 

•	 This  quiz  is  closed   book,  but  two  “crib”  sheets  are  allowed. 
•	 Put your name on each   sheet of the answer booklet, and your recitation instructor’s name 
and  time  on  the  cover  page  of  that  booklet. 
•	 Only  the  answer  booklet  will  be  considered  in  the  grading;  no  additional  answer  or 
solution   written   elsewhere  will  be   considered.  Absolutely  no  exceptions! 
•	 Neat  work  and   clear  explanations   count;  show  all  relevant  work  and  reasoning!  
You  may  want  to  ﬁrst  work  things  through  on  scratch  paper  and  then  neatly  transfer  to 
the  answer  booklet  the  work  you  would  like  us  to  look  at.  Let  us  know  if  you  need 
additional  scratch  paper. 
•	 The quiz will be graded out of 50  points.  The three  problems  are nominally weighted 
as  indicated  (but  our  legal  department wishes  to  let  you  know  that we  reserve  the  right 
to  modify  the  weighting  slightly   when  we  grade,  if  your  collective  answers  and  common 
errors  end  up  suggesting  that  a modiﬁed  weighting  would  be more  appropriate).

Problem   1  (36  points) 

(a) 

(i)  Using  the usual notation  for  state  space model, we have H (s) = cT (sI   − A)−1b + d. 
cb
For  the  forst  order  case,  this  reduces  to  H (s) =  s−a  + d.  Comparing  with  H1 (s) = 
1  + 1.  We  ﬁnd  that 
s−1 

q˙1 (t) =  q1 (t) + x1 (t) 
y(t) =  q1 (t) + x1 (t) 

(b) 

(ii)  Is  your  state-space  model  for  System  1: 
•	 reachable?  Yes.  The ﬁrst order system is in modal form and β  = 1.  Alternatively 
there  is  no  hidden  mode. 
•  observable?  Yes.  Using  the  same  reason  as  above,  since  ξ = 1  (cid:3)= 0The  system  is 
observable.  Alternatively  there  is  no  hidden  mode.. 
•	 asymptotically  stable?  No.  The  system  has  a  pole  at  1,  in  the  right  half  plane. 
(i)  Using H2 (s) =  cb  + d and comparing with the state space equations we get,H2 (s) =
s−a 
2 
s−µ 
(ii)  For  what  values  of  µ,  if  any,  is  the  state-space  model  of  System  2: 
•	 unreachable?  No  values.  Note  that  β  = 1  for  any  choice  of  µ.  Alternatively  the 
system  has  no  hidden  modes. 
•	 unobservable?  No values.  Note  that  ξ = 1  for any  choice of µ.  Alternatively  the 
system  has  no  hidden  mode. 
•	 asymptotically  stable?  µ < 0.  Note  that  we  are  assuming  that  µ  is  real  since  it 
is  a  parameter  of  the  state  space  model. 

(c) 

(i) 

q˙1 (t) =  q1 (t) + x1 (t) 
q˙2 (t) =  µq2 (t) + x2 (t) 
=  µq2 (t) + q1 (t) + x1 (t) 

y2 (t) = 2q2 (t) 

Combining,  these  we  get:


q˙ (t) = Aq(t) + bx1 (t)

(ii)  Since  we  have  solved  from  the  state  space  equations  in  the  previous  part,  it  is  easy 
to  compute  the  transfer  function.  Using  the  usual  notation:

Note  that  H (s) =  H1 (s)H2 (s).  This  is  expected  because  the  overall  system  is  a 
cascade  of  two  LTI  systems. 
(iii)  Since	 A  is  triangular,  its  eigen  values  are  same  as  the  elements  on  its  principal 
diagonal.  accordingly,  we  have

Note  this  makes  sense  since  these  are  also  the  poles  of  H (s).  Let  v1  and  v2  be  the

associated  eigen  vectors.  Using

Here  k1  and  k2  can  be  arbitrary  non-zero  constants.

We  can  write  the  state  evolution  equation  as

q(t) = α1v1 (t)et  + α2v2eµ t 
Where  α1  and  α2  are  determined  by  initial  conditions.  Since  we  want  the  response

to decay to zero, we require that the ﬁrst mode should not be excited and that µ < 0.

The  initial  condition  thus  is  of  the  form  q(0) = α

(iv)  For  what  values  of  µ,  if  any,  is  the  overall  system  in  (c)(ii): 
•	 unreachable?  —  which  natural  frequencies  are  unreachable? 
The  system  is  unreachable  if  βi  =  0  for  some  βi .  Since  our  system  is  second

If  µ  =  0,  the  clearly  β2  =  0  and  the  system  is  unreachable.  The  second  mode 
will  be  unreachable.

Clearly  the  system  is  not  unobservable  for  any  value  of  µ 
s  2  =  2

For  µ  = 0,  H2 (s) =  s ,  but  H (s) = 
s−1 .  Thus  there  is  a  hidden  mode  for 
s−1  s 
µ  =  0.  The  pole  of  the  second  subsystem  is  shielded  from  the  input  by  the  zero  of 
the  ﬁrst  subsystem.  Hence  the  mode  at  λ2  = 0  is  unreachable.  But  it  is  still  visible 
in  the  output.  So  the  system  is  observable. 

= 2  (cid:3)= 0

(d)  Since we need to ﬁnd the natural frequencies, we need to set up the characteristic equation

The  characteristic  polynomial  is  obtained  from  det(sI − A + bgT ).  After  some  simpliﬁ-
cation  this  reduces  to  s2  − s(g1  + g2  + µ + 1) + µ(1 + g1)  Comparing  with  our  desired 
characteristic  funcion  (s + 1)2  + 1 = s2  + 2s + 2m,  we  get 
g1  + g2  = −2 − µ − 1 
µ(1 + g1 ) = 2 

Solving  these  simulataneous  equations,  we  have

Again,  if  µ  =  0,  the  value  of  these  gains  become  inﬁnite.  This  reconciles  with  the  fact 
that the system in unreachable for µ = 0, and feedback can no longer stabilize the system.

This  scheme will work  for  all  values  of µ.  This  is  consistent with  the  fact  that  the  system 
is  observable  for  all  values  of  µ.

Problem  2  (7  points) 

Consider  a  nonlinear  time-invariant  state-space  model  described  in  the  form 

(a)  For  the  equilibrium  points  we  will  set  q˙1 (t) = 0  and  q˙2 (t) =  0.  Solving,  we  get  q2 (t) = 0 
β ) 1 
1 (t) = x.  Thus  the  equilibrium  points  are  given  by  q1  = ( x
and  β q3	
3 and  q2  = 0. 

(b)  We  linearize  the  ﬁrst  state  space  equation  as  follows 

q˙1 )(t) =  q2 (t) 
q˙1  + qˇ˙1 (t) =  q2  + ˇq2 (t)

qˇ˙1 (t) =  qˇ2 (t)


The  second  state  equation  may  be  linearized  as  follows,

q˙2 (t) =  −β q3

1 (t) + x(t) 
q˙2  + qˇ˙2 (t) =  −β (q1  + ˇ

Problem  3  (7  points) 
It  was  announced  in  class  that  0 < Ω0  < π . 

The  signals  that  produce  zero  yc (t)  are  those  for  which  ωin  maps  to  +Ωo  + 2kπ  for  integer 
k.  Thus  we  have 

Ωo 
ωin  = +  +

Also  note  that 

cos(ωin t + θ)|t=nT	 =  cos(ωinT n + θ) 
=  cos(+Ωon + θ + 2kπ) 
=  cos(+Ωon + θ) = x[n] 

With  this  x[n],  the  notch  ﬁlter  produces  y [n] = 0,  so  yc (t) = 0.  No  other  ωin  will  have  this 
property  of  aliasing  to  the  appropriate  locations.
