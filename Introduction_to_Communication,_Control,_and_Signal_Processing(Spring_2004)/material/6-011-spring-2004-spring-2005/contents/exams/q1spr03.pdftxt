Question  Booklet 

•	 This  quiz  is  closed book,  but  two  “crib”  sheets  are  allowed. 

•	 Put your name on each   sheet of the answer booklet, and your recitation  instructor’s name 
and  time  on  the  cover  page  of  that  booklet. 

•	 Only   the  answer  booklet  will  be  considered  in  the  grading;  no  additional  answer  or 
solution  written  elsewhere  will  be  considered.  Absolutely  no  exceptions! 

•	 Neat   work   and   clear   explanations   count;   show   all   relevant   work   and   reasoning!  
You  may  want  to  ﬁrst  work  things  through  on  scratch  paper  and  then  neatly  transfer  to 
the  answer  booklet  the  work  you  would  like  us  to  look  at.  Let  us  know  if  you  need 
additional  scratch  paper. 

•	 The quiz will be graded out of 50  points. The three  problems  are nominally weighted 
as   indicated   (but  our  legal  department wishes  to  let  you  know  that we  reserve  the  right 
to  modify  the  weighting  slightly  when  we  grade,  if  your  collective  answers  and  common 
errors  end  up  suggesting  that  a modiﬁed  weighting  would  be more  appropriate).

Problem 1  (20  points) 

Parts  (a),  (b),  (c)  and  (d)  here  can  be  done  independently  of  each  other. 

(a)  (4 points)  The DTFT  of  a DT  signal  x[n] is 
X (ejΩ ) = ej 2Ω (1 − e −j 3Ω ) . 

Completely  specify  x[n]. 

(b)  (4 points) Suppose we know that the DTFT X (ejΩ ) of a particular (deterministic) signal 
x[n] has  a  magnitude  of  2 for  |Ω| <  0.4π ,  and  unknown  magnitude  for  0.4π  ≤ |Ω| ≤ π . 
� 
This  signal  is  applied  to  the  input  of  an  ideal  lowpass  ﬁlter  whose  frequency  response 
H (ejΩ ) is  3  in  the  interval  |Ω| < 0.25π  and  is  0  for  0.25π  ≤ |Ω| ≤ π .  What  is  the  energy  
y2 [n]  of  the  output  signal  y [n] ?  Remember  to  show  your  reasoning. 
minimum-mean-squared-error  (LMMSE)  estimator  Y� (X ) of  Y  in  terms  of  X  is  given  by 
(c)  (6 points) Suppose X  and Y  are zero-mean  unit-variance  random variables.  If  the  linear 
Y� (X ) = 
3 X ,
4 
��
what  is  its  mean-squared-error  (MSE)?  Also,  suppose  the  random  variable  Q  is  deﬁned 
by  Q = Y  + 3;  what  is  the  LMMSE  estimator  Q(X ) of  Q  in  terms  of  X ,  and  what  is  its 
MSE?  Finally,  what  is  the  LMMSE  estimator  X (Y ) of  X  in  terms  of  Y ,  and  what  is  its 
MSE? 
(d)  (6 points) Suppose x( · )  is a wide-sense-stationary  (WSS)  random process with mean µx 
and  autocovariance  function  Cxx(τ ) = 2e−|τ | .  The  process  x( · )  turns  out  to  be  ergodic 
�  T
in  the  mean,  i.e.,  the  time  average  equals  the  ensemble  mean: 
1 
lim 
T ↑∞  2T  −T 
(For 1 point  extra  credit:  what feature of our characterization of the process guarantees 
this  ergodicity  in  the mean?) 
If  now  y(t) = x(t) + Z , where Z  is  a  zero-mean  random  variable with  variance  σ2 
Z , and Z 
is  independent  of  the  process  x( · ),  determine  the  mean  µy  and  autocovariance  function 
�  T
Cyy (τ )  of  the  process  y( · ).  Also  determine  what  the  time-average 
1 
lim 
T ↑∞  2T  −T 
would be for a general  sample function of the process y( · ).  Using this result or otherwise, 
determine  if  the  process  y( · )  is  ergodic  in  the  mean.

Problem 2  (20  points) 

The message signal y [n] in the ﬁgure below is to be encrypted and transmitted across a noisy 
channel,  then  decrypted  and  ﬁltered  at  the  receiver.  We  model  y [n]  as  a  wide-sense  stationary 
(WSS)  zero-mean  random  process  with  autocorrelation  function  Ryy [m]  and  corresponding 
power  spectral  density  (PSD)  Syy (ejΩ ). 
The  signal  p[n]  is  used  for  both  the  encryption  at  the  transmitter  and  the  decryption  at 
the  receiver,  and  is  an  i.i.d.  process  that  takes  the  values  +1  or  −1  with  equal  probability  at 
each  time;  it  is  independent  of  the  process  y [ · ].  Note  that  p2 [n] = 1  for  all  n.  The  transmitted 
signal  q [n]  is  the  product  p[n]y [n].

(a)  (8 points)  Determine  the  respective  means  µp  and  µq  of  the  processes  p[n] and  q [n], 
their  respective  autocorrelations  Rpp [m] and  Rqq [m]  (expressed  in  terms  of  Ryy [ · ]),  and 
also  the  cross-correlation  Ryq [m]  between  the  message  signal  and  the  transmitted  signal. 
Would an intruder who was able to intercept the transmitted process q [ · ] have any use for 
a  (possibly  noncausal)  linear  estimator  of  y [n]  based  on  measurements  of  q [ · ]?  Explain 
your  answer. 

The channel  adds a noise  signal  v [n]  to  the  transmitted  signal,  so  that  the  received  signal  is 

q [n] + v [n] = p[n]y [n] + v [n] . 

Assume v [n]  is  a  (zero-mean  and) white WSS process, with Rvv [m] = σ2 δ [m],  and  suppose  it  is 
v 
independent  of  the  processes  y [ · ] and  p[ · ].

We  assume,  as  indicated  in  the  block  diagram  above,  that  the  intended  receiver  knows  the 
speciﬁc  encryption  signal  p[n]  (i.e.,  the  speciﬁc  sample  function  from  the  ensemble  that  was 
used  for  encryption).  If  there  was  no  channel  noise  (i.e.,  if  we  had  v [n]  =  0),  the  decryption 
would  then  simply  involve  multiplying  the  received  signal  by  p[n],  because 

p[n]q [n] = p[n] (p[n]y [n]) = p 2 [n]y [n] = y [n] , 

where  the  last  equality  is  a  consequence  of  having  p2 [n] = 1. 
In  the presence of noise, we can  still attempt  to decrypt  in  the  same manner, but will  follow 
� 
� 
it  up  by  a  further  stage  of  ﬁltering.  The  signal  to  be  ﬁltered  is  thus 
x[n] = p[n]  p[n]y [n] + v [n] = y [n] + p[n]v [n] . 

(b)  (5 points)  Determine  µx ,  Rxx [m],  and  Ryx [m]. 

(c)  (7 points)  Suppose  the  ﬁlter  at  the  receiver  is  to  be  a  (stable)  noncausal  Wiener  ﬁlter, 
y�[n] of  y [n].  Determine  the  frequency  response H (ejΩ )  of  this  ﬁlter,  and  explicitly  check 
constructed  so as  to produce the  linear minimum-mean-squared-error (LMMSE) estimate 
that  it  is what  you  would  expect  it  to  be  in  the  two  limiting  cases  of  σ2  = 0  and  σ2  ↑ ∞.

Also write  an  expression,  in  terms  of  Syy (ejΩ ) and  σv

obtained  with  this  ﬁlter,  and  explicitly  check  that  it  is what  you  would  expect  it  to  be  in 
the  preceding  two  limiting  cases.

Problem 3  (10  points) 

Suppose  the  autocorrelation  function  Rxx [m]  of  a  zero-mean  wide-sense  stationary  (WSS) 
process  x[n]  has  the  following  Z -transform:

Sxx(z ) =  a(z )a(z−1 ) 

where 

L−2 
L−1 
a(z ) = z L  + a1 z 
+ · · · + aL 
+ a2 z 
is  a  polynomial  of  degree  L  whose  roots  are  all  inside  the  unit  circle.  We  can  evidently  also 
write  Sxx(z ) as 

Sxx(z ) = 

−L

=

1 + a1 z−1  + · · · + aLz−L  1 + a1 z + · · · + aLzL 

. 

(a)  (4 points)  Find  the  system  function M (z )  of  a  stable  and  causal  ﬁlter  with  a  stable  and 
causal  inverse  such  that M (z )M (z−1 ) = Sxx(z ). 

(b)  (6 points)  Find  the  system  function  H1 (z )  and  the  corresponding  unit-sample  response 
h1 [n] of a (stable) causal  Wiener ﬁlter  that uses measurements of x[ · ] up to and including 
time  n  in  order  to  produce  the  linear  minimum-mean-squared-error  (LMMSE)  estimate 
of  x[n + 1]  (so  the  ﬁlter  is  the  one-step   Wiener   predictor). 

Hint:   You  may  or  may  not  (depending  on  how  you  tackle  the  problem)  ﬁnd  it  convenient 
to  use  the  relation 

a1 zL  + a2 zL−1  + · · · + aLz 
a(z ) 

, 

zL+1 
a(z ) 
along  with  the  observation  that 

= z − 

a1 zL  + a2 zL−1  + · · · + aLz 
a(z ) 

has  an  inverse  transform  that  is  a  causal  and  stable  (i.e.,  absolutely  summable)  signal. 

Extra   credit:   For  2 points  extra  credit,  ﬁnd  the  system  function H2 (z )  and  unit-sample 
response h2 [n]  of  the  causal  two-step  Wiener  predictor  for  LMMSE  estimation  of  x[n + 2]  from 
measurements  of  x[ · ]  up  to  and  including  time  n.  You  may  leave  your  answer  in  terms  of  the 
coeﬃcients  p1 , · · · , pL  deﬁned  through  the  identity  below:

(These  coeﬃcients  p1 , · · · , pL  can  easily  be  written  explicitly  in  terms  of  a1 , · · · , aL ,  but  that’s 
not  important  to  do  here.)
