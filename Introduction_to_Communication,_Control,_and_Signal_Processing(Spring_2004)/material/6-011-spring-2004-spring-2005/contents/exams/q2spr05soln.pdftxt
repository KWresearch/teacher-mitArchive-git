Problem   1  (16  points) 

A  particular  ob ject  of  unit  mass,  constrained  to   move  in   a   straight  line,  is  acted  on  by 
an  external   force   x(t)  and   restrained  by  a  cubic  spring.  The  system  can   be  described   by  the 
equation 

d2p(t)
+  kp(t) − p3 (t) =  x(t) ,
dt2 
where  p(t)  denotes  the  position  of  the  mass  and  p3 (t)  is  the  cube  of  the  position  (not  its  third 
derivative!);  the  quantities  k  and    are  known  positive  constants. 

1(a)  (4  points)  Obtain   a  state-space   model  for   the  above  system,  using   physically  meaningful 
state  variables;  take  x(t) to  be  the  input  and  let  the  output  y(t) be  the  position  of  the  mass. 

q1 (t) =  p(t)


q2 (t) =   ˙p(t)

q˙2 (t) =  −kp(t) +  p3 (t) +  x(t)


State-space  model: 

q˙1 (t) =  q2 (t) 
q˙2 (t) =  {−k +  q2 
1 (t)}q1 (t) +  x(t) 
y(t) =  q1 (t)

1(b)  (5  points)  Suppose  x(t) ≡ 0  and  the  system   is  in  equilibrium.  You  will  ﬁnd  that  there 
are   three   possible  equilibrium  conditions  of  the  system.  Determine  the  values   of  your   state 
variables   in   each of  these   three   equilibrium  conditions,  expressing  your  results   in  terms  of  the 
parameters   k  and  . 

q˙1 (t) =  q¯˙1  = 0  ⇒ q2 (t) =   ¯q2  = 0

Problem   2  (16  points) 

A  particular  second-order continuous-time  causal  LTI system   has  natural  frequencies  λ1  = 
−3 and  λ2  =  −4  (these  are  the  eigenvalues  of  the  matrix  that  governs  state  evolution),  with 
associated   eigenvectors   v1  and  v2  respectively.  Its  input-output  transfer  function  is 

H (s) =  

s + 1  
(s + 3)(s + 4)  

.

2(a)  (2  points)  Is  the  system   reachable?   Is  it  observable?   Explain. 

Yes,   reachable  and   observable,   since  both  natural  frequencies  are  evident   in  the  transfer 
function,   with   no  pole/zero  cancellation  possible.

2(b)  (4  points)  Suppose   the  system   is  initially  at  rest,  i.e.,  its  initial  state  is  zero. Is  it now 
possible  to  choose  the  input  in  such  as  way  that  the  state  moves  out  along  the  eigenvector  v1 , 
with  no  component  along  v2  during  the  entire  motion?  Explain  your  answer  carefully. 

where: 

q(t) =  v1 r1 (t) +  v2 r2 (t) 

r˙1 (t) =  λ1 r1 (t) +  β1x(t), r1 (0)  = 0 

r˙2 (t) =  λ2 r2 (t) +  β2x(t), r2 (0)  = 0 
(cid:8)=  0  (because  of  reachability  of  the  second  mode),  any  nonzero   x(t)  - as  would 
Since  β2 
be  needed  to  make  r1 (t) 
= 0   and  result  in  a 
= 0  and   drive  along   v1  - would   also   force   r2 (t) 
component along  v2 .  So,  not  possible.

2(c)  Suppose  the  output  of  the  above  system  is  applied  to  the  input  of  another  causal 
second-order  LTI  system  with  transfer  function 

G(s) =  

s + 3  
s(s + 5)   . 
The  input  to  the  combined  system  is  then  just  the  original  input  to  the  ﬁrst  system,  while  the 
output  of  the  combined  system  is  the  output  of  the  second  system:

2(c)(i)  (2  points)  How  many   state   variables  are  there  in  the  state-space  description  of  the 
combined  system,  and  what  are   the   natural  frequencies  of  this  combined   system? 

The  interconnection  requires   2   state  variables  to  describe  the  ﬁrst  system  and  2  for   the 
second,  so  4  state  variables.   (  Because  of   the  pole-zero  cancellation,  there  are  3rd-order   state-
space  models  that  have  the  same  transfer  function,  but  that’s  not  what’s  asked.) 
The  natural  frequencies   of  a  cascade  of   two   systems  comprises  the  natural  frequencies  of 
systems,  hence,  −3,  −4,  0,  and  −5  in  this  case.

2(c)(ii)  (2  points)  Is  the  combined  system  asymptotically  stable?   Explain.


No,  because  there  is  an  eigenvalue   at  0.


2(c)(iii)  (3  points)  Is   the   combined  system  reachable  from  the  input  of   the  ﬁrst  system?  Is  
it  observable  from  the  output  of  the  second  system?  Explain. 

Observability   is  lost  because   a  zero  of   the  second  system   cancels  (hides)  a   pole  of  the  ﬁrst. 
However,  reachability  is  maintained  because  the  zero  of   the  ﬁrst  subsystem  does  not   cancel  
(shield)  any  poles   of  the  second  system.

Quiz  2,  April  14,  2005 

2(c)(iv)  (3  points)  If  you  were   to  build   an  observer  for  the  combined  system   (using  measure­
ments  of  the  input  to  the  ﬁrst  system  and  the  output  of  the  second  system),  could  you  get  the 
estimation  error  of  the  observer  to  decay?   If   not,  why  not;  and  if   so,  could  you  get  the  error   to 
decay  arbitrarily   fast?  Explain.  
The  error  dynamics  of  the  observer  would  retain  the  unobservable  mode  at   −3,  but  all  the 
other   modes  could  be  shifted  to  arbitrary  self-conjugate  positions.  Hence,  since  the  unobservable  
mode  is   stable,  we  can  always  get  all   modes  stable,  hence  a  decaying  estimation  error.  However, 
arbitrarily   fast   decay   won’t   be   possible.

Characteristic   polynomial:   z (z + 5) + 6  = (z + 2)(z + 3).  
So  natural  frequencies   are   −2,−3.  These  are  not  strictly  in  the  unit   circle,  so  the  system  is 
not  asymptotically   stable. 

Natural  frequencies:  −2,  −3.

The  system  is  observable,   but  there   is  a  hidden  mode,  so   the  system   must   be  unreachable
