Recitation   Instructor   &   Time   :


•	 This  quiz  is  closed  book,  but  one  sheet  of  notes  is  allowed.  Calculators  will  not  be 
necessary  and  are  not  allowed. 

•	 Put  your  name  in  the  space  indicated  above,  and  your  recitation  time  next  to  the  name 
of  your  instructor. 

•	 Check  that  you  have  pages  numbered  up  to  12.  The  booklet  contains  spaces  for  all  
answers. 

•	 Neat   work   and   clear   explanations   count;   show   all   relevant   work   and   reasoning!  
You  may  want  to  ﬁrst  work  things  through  on  scratch  paper  and  then  neatly  transfer  to 
this  booklet  the  work  you  would  like  us  to  look  at.  Let  us  know  if  you  need  additional 
scratch  paper.  All  scratch  paper  will  be  collected  at  the  end  of  the  quiz.  However, 
only  this  booklet will be considered  in  the  grading; no  additional  answer  or  solution 
written  elsewhere  will  be  considered.  Absolutely  no  exceptions! 

•	 There  are  two  problems,  weighted  as  indicated  on  the  question  booklet. 

•	 DO   NOT   DISCUSS   THIS   QUIZ   WITH   STUDENTS   WHO   HAVE   NOT   YET

Problem 1  (35  points) 

1(a)  (10  points)  The  frequency  response  of  a  particular  DT  LTI  system  is 

H (ejΩ ) = 

ej 2Ω 
1 −  1  −jΩ 
e2 
Determine  its unit-sample  response h[n].  (If you do this  correctly,  you will ﬁnd that  the  system 
�  π 
∞�
is  neither  causal  nor  anti-causal.)  Also  determine

and

Caution:  You  need  to  get  the  value  of  the  integral  exactly  right  to  get  credit  for  that  part,  so 
read  carefully  to  see  what  is  asked —  and  evaluate  the  integral  without  doing  any  integration!

Caution:  Make  sure  you  move  on  to  Problem  2  if  you  ﬁnd  yourself  taking  too  long  or 
getting  stuck  in  part  1(d)  below. 

1(d) (10 points) With all quantities as previously deﬁned, and assuming µx  = 0 for simplicity, 
suppose  what  you  can  measure  is  q [n] =  y [n] + v [n]  for  all  n, where  v [n]  is  (zero-mean)  white 
2 , and is uncorrelated with the process x[k ].  Compute the frequency response 
noise of intensity σv 
estimate  �x[n + 2]  as  output  at  time  n.  Explicitly  check  that  your  answer  reduces  to  something 
W (ejΩ ) of the non-causal Wiener ﬁlter that has q [n] as input at time n and produces the LMMSE 
that  you  expect  in  the  case  that  σ2  = 0.

2(b)  (10 points) For  each  of the  following  functions R[m],  state whether or not  it can be the 
autocorrelation  function  of  a  DT  WSS  random  process,  where  m  denotes  the  lag.  If  it  cannot 
be,  explain  why  not.  If  it  can  be,  explain  in  detail  how  you  would  obtain  such  a  process  by 
appropriately  ﬁltering  a  Bernoulli  process  that  takes  values  at  each  time  instant  of  +1  or  −1, 
with  equal  probability.
