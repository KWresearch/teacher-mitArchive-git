***** Readings *****
This is a subject that combines topics which have traditionally been taught
separately, so there is no single text that is appropriate for it. We will rely
largely on the 6.011 lecture notes which will be handed out. We will assume you
have the following 6.003 and 6.041 texts:
Oppenheim, A. V., and A. S. Willsky, with H. Nawab. Signals_and_Systems. 2nd
ed. Upper Saddle River: Prentice-Hall, 1997. ISBN: 0138147574.
Bertsekas, D. P., and J. N. Tsitsiklis. Introduction_to_Probability. Belmont,
MA: Athena Scientific Press, 2002. ISBN: 188652940X.
As already mentioned earlier, we will be using MATLABÂ® for some parts of the
homework. There is also a new pocket-sized primer on MATLABÂ®.
Sigmon, K., and T. A. Davis. MATLABÂ®_Primer. 6th ed. New York, NY: Chapman and
Hall/CRC Press, 2001. ISBN: 1584882948.
You might be interested in the Student Edition of MATLABÂ® for your own
computer, for \$99 or so (and with size restrictions removed), see The
MathWorks_Store.
Some other important texts that might be helpful references are:
Buck, J. R., M. M. Daniel, and A. C. Singer. Computer_Explorations_in_Signals
and_Systems_Using_MATLABÂ®. 2nd ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice-Hall,
2001. ISBN: 0130421553.
Strum, R. D., and D. E. Kirk. Contemporary_Linear_Systems_Using_MATLABÂ®.
Thomson Learning, 1999. ISBN: 0534371728.
Ziemer, R. E. Elements_of_Engineering_Probability_and_Statistics. Upper Saddle
River: Prentice-Hall, Pearson Education, 1997. ISBN: 0024316202.
Oppenheim, A. V., and R. W. Schafer, with J. R. Buck. Discrete-Time_Signal
Processing. Upper Saddle River: Prentice-Hall, 1999. ISBN: 0137549202.
Leon-Garcia, A. Probability_and_Random_Processes_for_Electrical_Engineering.
2nd ed. Reading, MA: Addison-Wellesley, 1994. ISBN: 020150037X.
Helstrom, C. W. Probability_and_Stochastic_Processes_for_Engineers. 2nd ed.
Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, NJ, 1991. ISBN: 0023535717.
Yates, R. D., and D. J. Goodman. Probability_and_Stochastic_Processes:_A
Friendly_Introduction_for_Electrical_and_Computer_Engineers. 2nd ed. New York,
NY: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2004. ISBN: 0471272140.
Hsu, H. P. Schaum's_Outline_of_Probability,_Random_Variables,_and_Random
Processes. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, 1996. ISBN: 0070306443.
Ziemer, R. E., and W. H. Tranter. Principles of Communications: Systems,
Modulation, and Noise. 3rd ed. Boston, MA: Houghton, Mifflin, 1990. (The 4th
edition was released in 1995, but now omits some topics of interest to us.)
