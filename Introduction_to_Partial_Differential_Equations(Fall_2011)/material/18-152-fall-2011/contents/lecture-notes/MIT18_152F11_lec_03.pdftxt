Class Meeting # 3: The Heat Equation: Uniqueness

The results from the previous lecture produced one solution to the Dirichlet problem
(t, x) ∈ (0, T ] × [0, 1],

But how do we know that this is the only one? In other words, we need to answer the uniqueness
question (6) from the previous lecture. The next theorem addresses this question. We ﬁrst need to
introduce some important spacetime domains that will play a role in the analysis.
Deﬁnition 1.0.1. Let Ω ⊂ Rn be a bounded spatial domain (i.e., an open connected subset of Rn ),
and let T > 0 be a time. We deﬁne the corresponding spacetime cylinder QT ⊂ R1+n by

Theorem 1.1 (A uniqueness result for the heat equation on a ﬁnite interval). Solutions
u ∈ C 1,2 (QT ) to the inhomogeneous heat equation
∂tu − D∂ 2
xu = f (t, x)
are unique under Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, or mixed conditions.
Remark 1.0.1. By u ∈ C 1,2 (QT ), we mean that the time derivatives of u(t, x) up to order 1 (the
ﬁrst index) are continuously diﬀerentiable on QT and extend continuously to the closure of QT ,
and also that all spatial derivatives of u(t, x) up to order 2 (the second index) are continuously
diﬀerentiable on QT and extend continuously to the closure of QT . Unfortunately, these kind of
ugly technical details often play a role in PDE theory.

Remark 1.0.2. In its current form Theorem, 1.1 is not quite strong enough to apply to the problem
(1.0.1). More precisely, the solution to that problem has a discontinuity at (0, 1), while Theorem
1.1 requires that the solutions are of class C 1,2 (QT ). Uniqueness does in fact hold in a certain sense
for the problem (1.0.1), but the because of the discontinuity, this issue is best addressed in a more
advanced course.

Proof. Let’s do the Dirichlet proof in the case D = 1. Assume we have two solutions to (1.0.5) with
speciﬁed Cauchy and Dirichlet data. Then by subtracting them and calling the diﬀerence w, we get
another solution w satisfying ∂tw − ∂ 2
(t, x) ∈ [0, T ] × [0, L],

xw = 0,
x ∈ [0, L],
w(0, x) = 0,
(1.0.6)
t ∈ [0, T ].
w(t, 0) = 0,
w(t, L) = 0,
We want to show that w(t, x) = 0 for (t, x) ∈ [0, T ] × [0, L]. We perform the following super-
important and very commonly
used strategy: we multiply both sides of (1.0.6) by w and integrate

So if we deﬁne the energy

But E (0) = 0 by the initial conditions of w. Therefore, E (t) = 0 for t ∈ [0, T ]. But since w2 (t, x) is
continuous and non-negative, it must be that w2 (t, x) = 0 for (t, x) ∈ [0, T ] × [0, L].
(cid:3)

Remark 1.0.3. Broadly speaking, the strategy we have used in this proof is called the energy
method. It is a very ﬂexible strategy that applies to many PDEs.
Note also that we did not need to know very much about the solution to conclude that it is
unique! In particular, we didn’t need to “ﬁnd a formula” for the solution!

Note also that E (t) is the square of the spatial L2 ([0, L]) norm of w at time t.
