Class Meeting # 11: The Method of Spherical Means
1. 1 + 3 spacetime dimensions and the method of spherical means
W+e would now like to derive an analog of d’Alembert’s formula in the physically relevant case
Given a solution u(t, x) to the 1 + 3 dimensional wave equation, we will deﬁne a spherical

For ﬁxed x, we will show that a slight mo( diﬁcation

We will take a limit as the averaging goes to 0 in order to recover an expression for u t, x .
