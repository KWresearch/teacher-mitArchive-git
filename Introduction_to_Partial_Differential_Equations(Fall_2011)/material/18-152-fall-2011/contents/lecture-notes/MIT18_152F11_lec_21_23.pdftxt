18.152 Introduction to PDEs, Fall 2011

Professor: Jared Speck

Class Meeting # 21: Lagrangian Field Theories
Many of the PDEs of interest to us can be realized as the Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding
to a function known as a Lagrangian L. Closely related are the notions of the action corresponding
to the Lagrangian, and the notion of a stationary point of the action. These ideas fall under a
branch of mathematics known as the calculus of variations. As we will see, these ideas will provide
a framework for deriving conserved (and more generally almost-conserved) quantities for solutions
to the Euler-Lagrange equations, the availability of which plays a central role in the analysis of
these solutions. Some important examples of PDEs to which these methods apply include the
familiar linear wave equation, Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism, the Euler equations of
ﬂuid mechanics, and the Einstein equations of general relativity.

1. Variational formulation (The Action Principle)
In this section, we will study (scalar-valued) functions φ on R1+n . They are sometimes called
(scalar-valued) ﬁelds on R1+n . We will use the notation

x = (x0 , x1 , · · · , xn )
(1.0.1)
to denote the standard coordinates on R1+n , and as usual, we will sometimes use the alternate
notation x0 = t. We will use the notation

(1.0.2)

∇ def
φ = (∇tφ, ∇1φ, · · · , ∇nφ)
to denote the spacetime gradient of φ. We will study PDEs that are (in a sense to be explained)
generated by a Lagrangian.
Deﬁnition 1.0.1 (Lagrangian). A Lagrangian L is a function of φ and ∇φ (and sometimes the
spacetime coordinates x and perhaps other quantities too). We indicate the dependence of L on
e.g. φ and ∇φ by writing

L(φ, ∇φ).

linear wave equation, where m−1 = diag(−1, 1, 1, · · · , 1) is the standard Minkowski metric.
Given a Lagrangian L and a compact subset of spacetime K, we can deﬁne an important functional
known as the action. The action inputs functions φ and outputs a real number.
Deﬁnition 1.0.2 (Action). Let K ⊂ R1+n be a compact subset of spacetime. We deﬁne the action
A of φ over the set K by

A main theme that runs throughout this section is that it is possible to generalize certain aspects
of standard calculus, which takes place on R1+n , to apply to (inﬁnite dimensional) spaces of func-
tions. In this context, the action A plays the same role that a function plays in standard calculus.
Moreover, many important PDEs have solutions that are stationary points 1 for the action. The
notion of a stationary point is a generalization of the notion of a critical point from calculus. In
order to deﬁne a stationary point of A, we will need to introduce the notion of a variation. The
motivation behind the next two deﬁnitions is that we would like to understand how A[φ; K] changes
when we slightly change φ.
Deﬁnition 1.0.3 (Variation). Given a compact set K, a function ψ ∈ Cc
∞ (K) is called a variation.
Deﬁnition 1.0.4. Given a variation ψ and a small number , we deﬁne

We now give the deﬁnition of a stationary point
equivalent of critical points2 from calculus.
Deﬁnition 1.0.5 (Deﬁnition of a stationary point φ). We say that φ is a stationary point of
the action if the following relation holds for all compact subsets K and all variations ψ ∈ Cc

We now observe that (1.0.9) is equal to 0 for all variations ψ if and only if the term in large brackets

we have thus shown that (1.0.7) holds if and only if φ is a stationary point of the action.

2. Coordinate Invariant Lagrangians

Many important PDEs are the Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding to coordinate invariant
Lagrangians; we will explain what this means momentarily. Motivated by this claim, we will now
introduce a class of changes of coordinates on spacetime. The new coordinates will be formed by
ﬂowing the old coordinates in the direction of a vectorﬁeld Y on spacetime. These new coordinates
will therefore verify a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations generated by the ﬂow of Y . In the
next proposition, we review some facts concerning these new coordinates; these facts are basic
results in ODE theory.

Y 0 (x0(cid:124) , · (cid:123)(cid:122)· · , xn(cid:125)), Y 1 (x0 , · · · , xn ), · · · , Y n (x0 , · · · , xn )(cid:1) be a smooth vectorﬁeld on R1+n . Assume that

Proof. Most of the results of Proposition 2.0.1 are standard facts from ODE theory and will not
be proved here. We will show how to derive the expansions (2.0.21) and (2.0.22) from the other
results. To this end, we will need some basic facts from matrix theory. We will use the following
norm for (1 + n) × (1 + n) matrix-valued functions on R1+n :

Now if I is the 1 + n identity matrix3, and (cid:107)A(cid:107) is a suﬃciently small (1 + n) × (1 + n) matrix, then
the matrix M = (I − A)−1 can be expanded in a convergent series:

(2.0.23)

(2.0.24)

(I − A)−1 = I + A + A2 + A3 + · · · .
Note in particular that the tail (i.e., all but the ﬁrst two terms) can be bounded by

(cid:107)A2 + A3 + A4 + · · · (cid:107) = (cid:107)A2 (I − A)−1(cid:107) ≤ 2(cid:107)A(cid:107)2 ,
(2.0.25)
if (cid:107)A(cid:107) is suﬃciently small. We now apply (2.0.24) and (2.0.25) to the matrix M deﬁned in (2.0.18)
ν = ∇ µ
def
(where Aµ
ν Y ), thereby arriving at (2.0.21).
To derive (2.0.22), we ﬁrst Taylor expand the determinant (viewed as a real-valued function of
matrices) for suﬃciently small (cid:107)A(cid:107) :

α + O((cid:107)A(cid:107)2 )
det(I + A) = 1 + Aα
(2.0.26)
Above, we write O((cid:107)A(cid:107)2 ) to denote a term that can be bounded by C (cid:107)A(cid:107)2 , where C > 0 is some
positive constant independent of (all suﬃciently small) A. The expansion (2.0.22) now follows from
(2.0.21) and (2.0.26). We remark that you will derive the expansion (2.0.26) in your homework in
more detail.

We will now “deﬁne” how various ﬁelds and their derivatives transform under a change of coordi-
nates. A full justiﬁcation of these deﬁnitions can be found in books on tensor analysis or diﬀerential

generalization can be found in books on tensor analysis/ diﬀerential geometry. Roughly speaking,
tensors with indices downstairs transform by multiplication by the matrix M −1 (one copy of M −1
for each index), and tensors with indices upstairs transform by multiplication by the matrix M (one
copy of M for each index).

We will now deﬁne what it means for a Lagrangian to be coordinate invariant.

all spacetime diﬀeomorphisms x → x,(cid:101) we have that

As we will see, the availability of an energy-momentum tensor for certain Euler-Lagrange equa-
tions is closely connected to the coordinate invariance property of their Lagrangians. In order to
derive this connection, we will need to understand more about how the coordinate transformations
(2.0.16) vary with .

3. The energy-momentum tensor

The main goal of this section is to show that for a certain class of coordinate invariant Lagrangians
L, there exists an energy-momentum tensor T µν . This T µν plays the same role in the analysis of the
corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation corresponding to L as it did in our previous analysis of the
linear wave equation. More precisely, for solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equation corresponding
to L, we will show that ∇µT µν = 0. As we saw earlier in the course, this identity forms the basis
for the derivation of conserved quantities in solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equations.

Theorem 3.1 (Derivation and divergence-free property of the energy-momentum ten-
sor). Let L(φ, ∇φ, m) be a coordinate invariant Lagrangian (in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.0.7) that
depends only on φ, ∇φ, and the Minkowski metric m. Let

be the energy-momentum tensor corresponding to L. Then T µν is symmetric:

(3.0.37)

T µν = T ν µ ,

0 ≤ µ, ν ≤ n.

Furthermore, if φ veriﬁes the Euler-Lagrange equation (1.0.7), the fol lowing divergence identity is
veriﬁed by T µν :

(ν = 0, 1, 2, · · · , n).

Proof. The relation (3.0.37) follows easily from (3.0.36) since mµν = mν µ .

On the other hand, we can diﬀerentiate under the integral on the right-hand side of (3.0.39) with
