a well-posed problem for (1.0.1), we will need to specify Cauchy (i.e. initial data) for u and also
∂tu. The fact that we need to specify Cauchy data is in stark contrast to Laplace’s equation, but
is analogous to the heat equation. The fact that we need to specify two pieces of Cauchy data is
connected to the fact that the wave equation is second order in time.

2. Where does it come from?

Equation (1.0.1) arises in an incredible variety of physical contexts, especially those involving
disturbances that propagate at a ﬁnite speed. Let’s discuss how the wave equation arises as an
spatial dimension. The +equations of ﬂuid mechanics, which are known as the Euler equations, take
approximation to the equations of ﬂuid mechanics. For simplicity, let’s only discuss the case of 1

Equation (2.0.2a) implies the conservation of mass,

A fundamental aspect of ﬂuid mechanics is that the system is not closed because there are not
enough equations. A common method of achieving closure is by choosing an equation of state, which
is a relationship between the ﬂuid variables. This relationship is often empirically determined. A
commonly studied equation of state is

Equation (2.0.7) is a wave equation for the perturbation δ t, x ! It models the propagation of sound
waves. This is the linear theory of acoustics! Note that the
speed associated to the equation (2.0.7)

depends on the background density ρ¯
K γ ρ¯γ−1 .
When γ > 1, higher background density (cid:212)⇒ faster sound speed propagation.

Remark 2.0.1. For air under “normal” atmospheric conditions, γ = 1.4 is a pretty good model.
3. Some Well-Posed Problems
Recall●
●●
that well-posed PDEs have three important properties:
Given suitable data, a solution exists.
The solution is unique.
The solution depends continuously on the data.
