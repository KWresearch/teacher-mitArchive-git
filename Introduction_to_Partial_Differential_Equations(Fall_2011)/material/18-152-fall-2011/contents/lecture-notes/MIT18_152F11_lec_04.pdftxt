Class Meeting #4: The Heat Equation: The Weak Maximum Principle

1. The Weak Maximum Principle
We will now study some important properties of solutions to the heat equation ∂tu−D∆u = 0. For
simplicity, we sometimes only study the case of 1 + 1 spacetime dimensions, even though analogous
properties are veriﬁed in higher dimensions.
Theorem 1.1 (Weak Maximum Principle). Let Ω ⊂ R
def
n be a domain. Recal l that QT =
(0, T ) ×
Ω is a spacetime cylinder and that ∂pQT = {0} × Ω ∪ (0, T ] × ∂Ω is its corresponding
def
parabolic boundary. Let w ∈ C 1,2 (QT ) ∩ C (QT ) be a solution to the (possibly inhomogeneous) heat
equation

wt − D∆w = f ,
(1.0.1)
where f ≤ 0. Then w(t, x) obtains its max in the region QT on ∂pQT . Thus, if w is strictly negative
on ∂pQT , then w is strictly negative on QT .

Proof. For simplicity, we consider only case of 1 + 1 spacetime dimensions. Let  be a positive
number, and let u = w − t. Our goal is to ﬁrst study u, and then take a limit as  ↓ 0 to extract
information about w. Note that on QT we have u ≤ w, that w ≤ u + T , and that in QT we have
ut − Duxx = f −  < 0.
p T −
We claim that the maximum of u on QT
occurs on ∂ Q . To verify the claim, suppose that
−
u(t, x) has its max at (t0 , x0 ) ∈ QT  . We may assume that 0 < t0 ≤ T − , since if t0 = 0 the claim
−
is obviously true. Under this assumption, we have that u < w and that w ≤ u + T . Similarly, we
may also assume that x ∈ Ω, since otherwise we would have (t, x) ∈ ∂pQT − , and the claim would
be true.
Then from vector calculus, ux (t0 , x0 ) must be equal to 0. Furthermore, ut (t0 , x0 ) must also be
equal to 0 if t0 < T − , and ut (t0 , x0 ) ≥ 0 if t0 = T − . Now since u(t0 , x0 ) is a maximum value,
we can apply Taylor’s remainder theorem in x to deduce that for x near x0 , we have
u(cid:124) |
(cid:125)) +uxx |t0 ,x∗ (x − x0 ) ≤ 0,
(cid:123)(cid:122)
x t0 ,x0 (x − x0

0
uxx (t0 , x∗ ) ≤ 0, and by taking the limit as
∗
x is some point in between x0 and x. Therefore,
where
→ 0
0 ≤
x , it follows that u (t , x )
any possible
0. Thus, in
case, we have that

u(t0 , x) − u(t0 , x0 ) =

Using u ≤ w and that fact that ∂pQT  ⊂ ∂ Q

Using (1.0.5) and w ≤ u + T , we also have that

The following very important corollary shows how to compare two diﬀerent solutions to the heat
equation with possibly diﬀerent inhomogeneous terms. The proof relies upon the weak maximum
principle.

Corollary 1.0.1 (Comparison Principle and Stability). Suppose that v , w are solutions to the
heat equations

(1.0.10)

(1.0.11)

vt − Dvxx = f ,
wt − Dwxx = g .

Then
(1) (Comparison): If v ≥ w on ∂pQT and f ≥ g , then v ≥ w on al l of QT .
(2) (Stability): maxQ |v − w| ≤ max∂pQT |v − w| + T maxQ f
| − g |.

Proof. One of the things that makes linear PDEs relatively easy to study is that you can add or
subtract solutions: Setting u = w − v , we have
def

ut − Duxx = g − f ≤ 0.
(1.0.12)
Then by Theorem 1.1, since u ≤ 0 on ∂pQT we have that u ≤ 0 on QT . This proves (1).

(1.0.13)

Thus, by Theorem 1.1, we have that
