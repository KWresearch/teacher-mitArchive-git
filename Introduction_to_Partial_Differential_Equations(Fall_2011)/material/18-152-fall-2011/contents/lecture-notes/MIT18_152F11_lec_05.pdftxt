solution is called the fundamental solution.
Remark 1.0.1. Note that when Ω = Rn , there are no ﬁnite boundary conditions to worry about.
However, we do have to worry about “boundary conditions at ∞.” Roughly speaking, this means
that we have to assume something about the growth rate of the solution as |x| → ∞.

As we will see, (1) - (3) suggest that at t = 0, ΓD (0, x) behaves like the “delta distribution

Remark 1.0.2. The delta distribution is sometimes called the “delta function,” but it is not a
function in the usual sense !

So what is the delta distribution?

Deﬁnition 1.0.2. The delta distribution δ is an example of a mathematical ob ject called a distri-
bution. It acts on suitable functions φ(x) as follows:

(cid:104)δ, φ(cid:105) = φ(0).

Remark 1.0.3. The notation (cid:104)·, ·(cid:105) is meant to remind you of the L2 inner product

f (x)g(x) dnx.
(1.0.4)

The next lemma shows that ΓD (t, x) behaves like the delta distribution as t → 0+ .
Lemma 1.0.3. Suppose that φ(x) is a continuous function on Rn and that there exist constants
a, b ≥ 0 such that

|φ(x)| ≤ aeb|x|2 .

Remark 1.0.4. Lemma 1.0.3 can be restated as

On the left, (cid:104), (cid:105) means the integral inner product, whereas in the middle it has the meaning of
(1.0.3). We sometimes restate (1.0.13) as

(1.0.14)

lim ΓD (t, x) = δ(x).
t→0+

Let’s summarize the above results.

Proposition 1.0.4 (Properties of ΓD (t, x)). ΓD (t, x) is a solution to the heat equation (1.0.1)
(with f = 0) verifying the initial conditions

(1.0.15)

lim ΓD (t, x) = δ(x).

1.1. Solving the global Cauchy problem when n = 1. Let’s see how we can use ΓD to solve
the following initial value (aka Cauchy) problem:

(1.1.1)

ut − Duxx = 0,
u(0, x) = g(x).

(t, x) ∈ (0, ∞) × R,

We will make use of an important mathematical operation called convolution.

4
MATH 18.152 COURSE NOTES - CLASS MEETING # 5
Deﬁnition 1.1.1. If f and g are two functions on Rn , then we deﬁne their convolution f ∗ g to be
the following function on Rn :
(cid:90)
Rn

f (y)g(x − y) dny .

def
g)(x) =

(f ∗

(1.1.2)

Convolution is an averaging process, in which the function f (x) is replaced by the “average value”
of f (x) relative to the “proﬁle” function g(x).
The convolution operator plays a very important role in many areas of mathematics. Here are
two key properties. First, by making the change of variables z = x − y , dnz = dny in (1.1.2), we see
(cid:90)
(cid:90)
that
Rn
Rn

f (x − z )g(z ) dnz = (g ∗ f )(x),

f (y)g(x − y) dny =

(f ∗ g)(x) =

(1.1.3)

which implies that convolution is a commutative operation. Next, Fubini’s theorem can be used to
show that

(1.1.4)
so that ∗ is also associative.
Remark 1.1.1. According to (1.0.3) and (1.1.3),

f ∗ (g ∗ h) = (f ∗ g) ∗ h,

(1.1.5)

(f ∗ δ)(x) = (cid:104)δ(y), f (x − y)(cid:105)y = f (x),
so that in the context of convolutions, the δ distribution plays the role of an “identity element.”

(1.1.6)

The next proposition is a standard fact from analysis. It allows us to diﬀerentiate under integrals
under certain assumptions. We will use it in the proof of the next theorem.
Proposition 1.1.1 (Diﬀerentiating under the integral). Let I (a, b) be a function on R × R.
(cid:90)
Assume that

|I (a, b)| da <

(cid:90)
for al l b belonging to a neighborhood of b0 and deﬁne
def
(1.1.7)
J (b) =

Assume that there exists a neighborhood N of b0 such that for almost every1 a, ∂bI (a, b) exists for
b ∈ N . In addition, assume that there exists as function U (a) (deﬁned for almost al l a) such that
for b ∈ N , we have that |∂bI (a, b)| ≤ U (a) and such that

∞

1In a measure theory course, you would learn a precise technical deﬁnition of “almost every.” For the purposes of
this course, it suﬃces to know the following fact: if a statement holds for all a except for those values of a belonging
to a countable set, then the statement holds for almost every a. The main point is that the function I (a, b) does not
have to be “well-behaved” at every single value of a; it can have some “bad a spots,” just not too many of them.

Then near J (b) is diﬀerentiable near b0 , and

U (a) da < ∞.

∂bI (a, b) da.

Remark 1.1.2. An analogous proposition is true for functions I (a, b) deﬁned on Rm × Rn .

Theorem 1.1 (Solving the global Cauchy problem via the fundamental solution). Assume
that g(x) is a continuous function on Rn that veriﬁes the bounds |g(x)| ≤ aeb|x|2 , where a, b > 0 are
constants. Then there exists a solution u(t, x) to the homogeneous heat equation

verifying a bound of the form (1.1.13).

Remark 1.1.3. Note the very important smoothing property of diﬀusion: the solution to the
heat equation on all of Rn is smooth even if the data are merely continuous.

Remark 1.1.4. The formula (1.1.12) shows that solutions to (1.1.10) propagate with inﬁnite
speed: even if the initial data g(x) have support that is contained within some compact region,
(1.1.12) shows that at any time t > 0, the solution u(t, x) has “spread out over the entire space
Rn .” In contrast, as we will see later in the course, some important PDEs have ﬁnite speeds of
propagation (for example, the wave equation).

Proof. For simplicity, we only give the proof in the case n = 1. The basic strategy of the proof is to
analyze the behavior of ΓD (t, y) in detail.
Let u(t, x) be the function deﬁned by (1.1.12). The argument that follows will show that the right-
hand side of (1.1.12) is ﬁnite (and more). In fact, let us ﬁrst demonstrate the bound (1.1.13). To this
end, let  > 0 be any positive number. Then using the simple algebraic estimate |2xy | ≤ −1x2 + y 2 ,

Similarly, the fact that u ∈ C ∞(cid:0)(0,

As we will see, the fundamental solution is connected to some important invariance properties
associated to solutions of (2.0.21). These properties are addressed in the next lemma.

Lemma 2.0.2 (Invariance of solutions to the heat equation under translations and par-
abolic dilations). Suppose that u(t, x) is a solution to the heat equation (2.0.21). Let A, t0 ∈ R be
constants, and x0 ∈ Rn . Then the ampliﬁed and translated function

(2.0.22)

u∗

is also a solution to (2.0.21).
Similarly, if λ > 0 is a constant, then the ampliﬁed, parabolical ly scaled function

(2.0.23)

is also a solution.

u∗ (t, x) = Au(λ2 t, λx)
def

8

MATH 18.152 COURSE NOTES - CLASS MEETING # 5
Proof. We address only the case (2.0.23), and leave (2.0.22) as a simple exercise. Using the chain
tu)(λ t, λx) − (D∆u)(λ t, λx)(cid:9) = 0.
∂tu∗ (t, x) − ∆u∗ (t, x) = λ2A(cid:8)(∂
rule, we calculate that if u is a solution to (2.0.21), then

(2.0.24)

Thus, u∗ is also a solution.
We would now like to choose the constant A in (2.0.23) so that the “total thermal energy” of u∗
is equal to the “total thermal energy of ” of u.

It is important to note that for rapidly-spatially decaying solutions to the heat equation, T (t) is

∆u(t, x) = 0. Assume that at each ﬁxed t, lim x

more, assume that there exists a function f (x) ≥ 0, not depending on t, such that |∂tu| ≤ f (x) and
n f (x) dnx < ∞. Then the total thermal energy of u(t, x) is constant in time:

In the last steps, we have used the following basic fact from analysis: the condition lim

We now return to the issue of choosing constant A in (2.0.23) so that the total thermal energy of
u∗ is equal to the total thermal energy of of u. Using the change of variables z = λx, and recalling
from multi-variable calculus that dnz = λndnx, we compute that

we choose A = λn , which results
n u(λ2 t, z ) dnz is in fact the mass of u. Thus,

u(D2λ2 t, λx) dnx = Aλ−n

(2.0.30)

u∗ (t, x) = λnu(D2λ2 t, λx).
Motivated by the parabolic scaling result (2.0.23), we now introduce the dimensionless variable

ζ = √ ,

where we have used the fact that the constant D has the dimensions of [length2 ]/[time]. Note that
ζ is invariant under the parabolic scaling t → λ2 t, x → λx.
We now proceed to derive the fundamental solution. For simplicity, we only consider the case of
1 + 1 spacetime dimensions. We will look for a fundamental solution of the form

ΓD (t, x) = √ V (ζ ),

motivate(cid:82) the fact that ΓD (t, x) should look like (2.0.32). We ﬁrst note that since we would like to

Since we want ΓD (t, x) to behave like the δ distribution (at least for small t > 0), we demand that

V (ζ ) ≥ 0.
(2.0.36)
Furthermore, since we want ΓD (t, x) to rapidly decay as |x| → ∞, we demand that

(2.0.37)

V (±∞) = 0.
We also expect that ideally, V (ζ ) should be an even function. Furthermore, it is easy to see that if
V (ζ ) is a solution to (2.0.35), then so is W (ζ ) = V (−ζ ). Thus, it is reasonable to look for an even

solution. Now for any diﬀerentiable even function V (ζ ), it necessarily follows that V (cid:48) (0) = 0. Thus,
we demand that

V (cid:48) (0) = 0.
We now note that (2.0.35) can be written in the form

which implies that V (cid:48) (ζ ) + 1 ζ V (ζ ) is constant. By setting ζ = 0 in and using (2.0.38), we see that

this constant is 0 :
