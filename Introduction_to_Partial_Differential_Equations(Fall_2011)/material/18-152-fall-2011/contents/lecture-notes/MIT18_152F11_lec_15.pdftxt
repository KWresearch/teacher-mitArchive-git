2. Motivating example
Let’s consider the following second-order linear PDE on R1+n :

L def
u = Aαβ ∂ ∂ u + B α
∂αu + C u = 0.
(2.0.1)
α β
In (2.0.1), A, B , C are allowed to be functions of the coordinates (x0 , · · · , xn ). We will also use the
standard notation x0 = t. By the symmetry of the mixed partial derivatives, we can also assume
that A is symmetric:

MATH 18.152 COURSE NOTES - CLASS MEETING # 15

(2.0.2)

Aµν = Aν µ .

The question we would like to address at the moment is the following: what are the basic properties
of solutions to (2.0.1)? Is this equation most like a Laplace, heat, or wave equation? That is, is
(2.0.1) elliptic, diﬀusive, or hyperbolic? As we will see, the most important part of equation (2.0.1)
in this context is the principal part Aαβ ∂α∂β u, which involves the top-order derivatives.
To begin answering this question, let’s start with a simple example on R2 . Let’s try to classify
the following equation:

(2.0.3)

t u − 4∂t∂
L def
u = ∂ 2
2
xu + 2∂xu = 0.
Note that it would be easy to answer our question if we were able to make a linear change of
variables that eliminates the cross term −4∂t∂xu; the PDE would then look just like one of the
other ones we have already studied. More precisely, let’s try to eliminate the cross terms by making
good choices for the constants a, b, c, d in the following linear change variables:
(cid:101)t = at + bx,
x(cid:101) = ct + dx.
In order to have a viable change of variables, we also need to achieve the following non-degeneracy
condition from linear algebra:

(2.0.4b)

(2.0.4a)

(2.0.5)

(2.0.6a)

ad − bc = 0.
(2.0.5) states the determinant of the above linear transformation is non-zero, and that the trans-
formation is non-degenerate.
Then using the chain rule, we have that
(cid:101)

Note that (2.0.8) also veriﬁes the non-degeneracy condition (2.0.5). We remark that other choices
would also have worked. In the new coordinates, we have that

disguise:

Consider

xu + ∂xu = 0.
Using (2.0.6a) - (2.0.6b) again, we compute that
(cid:101) (cid:101)
Lu = (−2a2 − 2ab − b2 )∂ 2(cid:101) u + (−2ac − bd − 2ad − 2bc)∂t∂xu + (

Let’s do one ﬁnal example. Consider the PDE

(2.0.16)

t u − 2∂t∂xu + ∂ 2
L defu = ∂ 2
xu + ∂xu = 0.
Using (2.0.6a) - (2.0.6b) again, we compute that
Lu = (a2 − 2ab + b2 )∂ 2(cid:101) u + (2ac + 2bd − 2ad − 2bc)∂(cid:101)t∂x
(cid:101)u + (c2 − 2cd + d2 )∂ 2

Choosing

(2.0.18)

we see that

a = 1,

b = 0,

c = −1,

d = −1,

Lu = ∂ 2(cid:101) ut − ∂x(cid:101)u.

Thus, (2.0.16) is equivalent to

(2.0.20)
of “time” and (cid:101)t pla

Now observe that (2.0.20) is just the standard heat equation, with the variable x
ying
the role of “space.” Equation (2.0.20) is therefore diﬀusive (parabolic).

3. A general framework

In this section, we will establish a general framework for classifying second order constant co-
eﬃcient scalar PDEs. The framework will cover the three examples from the previous section as
special cases. The proof will reveal that the classiﬁcation is intimately connected to the theory of
quadratic forms from linear algebra. Throughout this section, we will use the notation

(3.0.21)

x = (x0 , x1 , · · · , xn ).
As above, we will investigate PDEs of the form

(3.0.22)
where Aµν = Aν µ .
We begin by providing a simple version of Hadamard’s classic deﬁnitions.

∂αu + C u = 0,

L def
u = Aαβ ∂ ∂ u + B α
α β

Deﬁnition 3.0.1 (Hadamard’s classiﬁcation of second order scalar PDEs). Equation (3.0.22)
is respectively said to be el liptic, hyperbolic, or parabolic according to the following conditions on
the (1 + n) × (1 + n) symmetric matrix A :
• All of the eigenvalues of A have the same sign - elliptic
• n of the eigenvalues of A have the same (non-zero) sign, and the remaining one has the
opposite (non-zero) sign - hyperbolic
• n of the eigenvalues of A have the same (non-zero) sign, and the remaining one is 0 -
parabolic

Remark 3.0.1. Many of the ideas in this section, including the deﬁnition above, can be generalized
to include the case where A depends on (x), or even on the solution u itself; PDEs of the latter
type are said to be quasilinear.

We now state and prove the main classiﬁcation theorem.

Theorem 3.1 (Classiﬁcation of second order constant-coeﬃcient PDEs). Consider the
fol lowing second order constant coeﬃcient PDE

linear algebraic theory guarantees the existence of such a basis). Then if the
non-zero vector
B satisﬁes B α (0)vα = 0, we also have that B 0 = 0.
Remark 3.0.2. The “±” sign above distinguishes whether or not most of the eigenvalue of Aµν
the eigenvalues of Aµν are positive, then Lu =
are positive or negative. For example, if all of
∆y u(y) + · · · , while if they are all negative, then Lu = −∆y u(y) + · · · (and similarly for the other
two cases).

Proof. Let’s consider the ﬁrst case, in which all of the eigenvalues have the same (non-zero) sign.
Then by standard linear algebra, since Aµν is symmetric and positive deﬁnite (perhaps after mul-
tiplying it by −1), there exists an invertible “change-of-basis” matrix M ν

This completes the proof in the ﬁrst case.
In the second case, in which n of the eigenvalues of A have the same (non-zero) sign, and the
remaining one has the opposite (non-zero) sign, the proof is similar. The key diﬀerence is that
because of the eigenvalue of opposite sign, (3.0.24) is replaced with

In the third case, in which n of the eigenvalues of A have the same (non-zero) sign, and the
remaining one is 0, the proof is similar. The key diﬀerence is that because of the zero eigenvalue,
(3.0.24) is replaced with
