1. Introduction to the Fourier Transform
Earlier in the course, we learned that periodic functions f ∈ L2 ([−1, 1]) (of period 2) can be
represented using a Fourier series:
(cid:88)

∞
∞
m=1
m=1
The “ = ” sign above is interpreted in the sense of the convergence of the sequence of partial sums
associated to the right-hand side in the L2 ([−1, 1]) norm. The coeﬃcients am and bm represent the
“amount of the frequency m” that the function f contains. These coeﬃcients were related to f
(cid:90) 1
itself by
(cid:90)−1

The Fourier transform is a “continuous” version of the formula (1.0.1) for functions deﬁned on
the whole space Rn . Our goal is to write functions f deﬁned on Rn as a superposition of diﬀerent

The formula (1.0.3) is analogous to the formulas (1.0.2a) - (1.0.2c). It provides the “amount of
the frequency component” ξ that f contains. Later in the course, we will derive an analog of the
representation formula (1.0.1).

Remark 1.0.1. The Fourier transform can be deﬁned on a much larger class of functions than
those that belong to L1 . However, to make rigorous sense of this fact requires advanced techniques
that go beyond this course.

We will also use the following notation.
Deﬁnition 1.0.2 (Inverse Fourier transform). Given a function f (ξ ) ∈ L1 (Rn ), its inverse
(cid:90)
Fourier transform, which is denoted by f ∨ , is a new function of x deﬁned as follows:
def ˆ − def
f (x)e2πiξ ·x dnξ .
∨
(1.0.4)
f (x) = f ( x) =
Rn
The name is motivated as follows: later in the course, we will show that (f )∨ = f . Thus, ∨ is in
ˆ
fact the inverse of the operator ∧.
The Fourier transform is very useful in the study of certain PDEs. To use it in the context
of PDEs, we will have to understand how the Fourier transform operator interacts with partial
derivatives. In order to do this, it is convenient to introduce the following notation, which will si-
multaneously help us bookkeep when taking repeated derivatives, and when classifying the structure
monomials.

Deﬁnition 1.0.3. If

(1.0.5)

α(cid:126) = (α1 , · · · , αn )
def
is an array of non-negative integers, then we deﬁne ∂α(cid:126) to be the diﬀerential operator

If x = (x1 , · · · , xn ) is an element of Cn

The following function spaces will play an important role in our study of the Fourier transform.
Throughout this discussion, the functions f are allowed to be complex-valued.

We also recall the following norm on the space of bounded, continuous functions f : Rn → C :

|f (x)|.

ˆ
The L2
norm plays an important role in Fourier analysis. Since f is in general complex-valued
we also need to extend the notion of the L2 inner product to complex-valued functions. This is
accomplished in the next deﬁnition.

Deﬁnition 1.0.5 (Inner product for complex-valued functions). Let f and g be complex-
valued functions deﬁned on Rn . We deﬁne their complex inner product by
(cid:90)
Rn

f (x)g¯(x) dnx,

(cid:104)f , g(cid:105) def
=

(1.0.11)

where g¯ denotes the complex conjugate of g . That is, if g(x) = u(x) + iv(x), where u and v are
real-valued, then g¯(x) = u(x) − iv(x).
def
(cid:16) (cid:90)
(cid:17)
We also deﬁne norm of f by

f , f (cid:105)1/2 =

Note that this is just the standard L2 norm extended to complex-v
alued functions.
Note that (cid:104)·, ·(cid:105) and (cid:107) · (cid:107) verify all of the standard properties associated to a complex inner product
and its norm:
• (cid:107)f (cid:107) ≥ 0 and (cid:107)f (cid:107) = 0 if and only if f = 0 almost everywhere
• (cid:104)g , f (cid:105) = (cid:104)f , g(cid:105) (Hermitian symmetry)
• If a and b are complex numbers, then (cid:104)af + bg , h(cid:105) = a(cid:104)f , h(cid:105) + b(cid:104)g , h(cid:105), and (cid:104)f , ag(cid:105) = a¯(cid:104)f , g(cid:105)
(Hermitian linearity)
• |(cid:104)f , g(cid:105)| ≤ (cid:107)f (cid:107)(cid:107)g(cid:107) (Cauchy-Schwarz inequality)
• (cid:107)f + g(cid:107) ≤ (cid:107)f (cid:107) + (cid:107)g(cid:107) (Triangle Inequality)

Taking the max over all ξ ∈ Rn , the estimate (2.0.13) thus follows.

We now prove that f is continuous. Given  > 0, let BR be a ball of radius R centered at the
origin such that the integral of |f | over its complement B c

It is possible to choose such a ball since f L1 . We then estimate

Now since e−2πir is a uniformly continuous function of the real number r on any compact set, if
|ξ − η | is suﬃciently small, then we can ensure that max
|e−2πiξ ·x − e−2πiη ·x
| ≤ . We then
x∈BR
(cid:90)
(cid:90)
conclude that the ﬁnal integral over BR on the right-hand side of (2.0.16) will be no larger than

Thus, in total, we have shown that if |ξ − η | is suﬃciently small, then |f (ξ ) − f (η)| ≤ (cid:107)f (cid:107)L1 + 2.

(cid:3)

Since such an estimate holds for all  > 0, f is continuous by deﬁnition.

It is helpful to introduce notation to indicate that a function has been translated.
Deﬁnition 2.0.6 (Translation of a function). If Rn → C is a function and y ∈ Rn is any point,
then we deﬁne the translated function τy f by

(2.0.18)

τy f (x) = f (x − y).

The next theorem collects together some very important properties of the Fourier transform. In
particular, it illustrates how the Fourier transform interacts with translations, derivatives, multi-
plication by polynomials, products, convolutions, and complex conjugates.

(2.0.19e) roughly shows that if f decays very rapidly at inﬁnity, then f is very diﬀerentiable.
Similarly, (2.0.19f) roughly shows that if f is very diﬀerentiable with rapidly decaying derivatives,
ˆ
then f also rapidly decays. The Fourier transform thus connects the decay properties of f to
ˆ
the diﬀerentiability properties of f , and vice versa. In the next proposition, we provide a speciﬁc
example of these phenomena. More precisely, the next proposition shows that the Fourier transform
of a smooth, compactly supported function is itself smooth and rapidly decaying at inﬁnity.
Proposition 2.0.2. Let f ∈ Cc
∞ (Rn ), i.e., f is a smooth, compactly supported function. Then f
ˆ
is smooth and “rapid ly decaying at inﬁnity” in the fol lowing sense: for each N ≥ 0, there exists a
constant CN > 0 such that

(2.0.27)

| ˆ
f (ξ )| ≤ CN (1 + |ξ |)−N .
Furthermore, an estimate similar to (2.0.27) holds (with possibly diﬀerent constants) for al l of the
derivatives |
ˆ∂ (cid:126)β f (ξ )|.
In particular, f ∈ L1 :

Proof. Using (2.0.19e) and the fact that f is compactly supported (and hence xα(cid:126) f
L1 ), we see
ˆ
that f is smooth.
To prove (2.0.27), we use (2.0.19f), (2.0.13), and the fact that (cid:107)∂α(cid:126) f (cid:107)L1 < ∞ for any diﬀerential
operator ∂α(cid:126) to deduce that

|(2π iξ )α(cid:126) ˆf (ξ )| = |(∂α(cid:126) f )∧ (ξ )| ≤ (cid:107)∂α(cid:126) f (cid:107)L1 = Cα(cid:126) ,
(2.0.29)

3. Gaussians

One of the most important classes of functions in Fourier theory is the class of Gaussians. The
next proposition shows that this class interacts very nicely with the Fourier transform.

Proof. We consider only the case b = 0, so that z = a. The cases b = 0 would follow from an
argument similar to the one we give below but requiring a few additional technical details. We ﬁrst
address the case n = 1. Then by properties (2.0.19e)-(2.0.19f) of Theorem 2.1, we have that

4. Fourier Inversion and the Plancherel Theorem

The next lemma is very important. It shows that the Fourier transform interacts nicely with the
L2 inner product.

(4.0.40) is equal to

f (ξ )g(x)e−2πiξ ·x dnξ dnx.

(4.0.42)

By the same reasoning, this is also equal to the right-hand side of (4.0.40).
To obtain (4.0.41), simply replace g with g¯ in the identity (4.0.40) and use property (2.0.19g).

The next theorem is central to Fourier analysis. It shows that the operators ∧ and ∨ are inverses

of each other whenever f and f are nice functions.
Theorem 4.1 (Fourier inversion theorem). Suppose that f : Rn → C is a continuous function,
that f ∈ L1

As t ↓ 0, the ﬁrst term on the right-hand side of (4.0.52) converges to 0. In particular, if t is
suﬃciently small, then the right-hand side of (4.0.52) will be no larger than 2. Since this holds
for any  > 0, we have thus shown that the right-hand side of (4.0.49) converges to the expression
(4.0.50) as t ↓
0, i.e., that it converges to (f )∨ (x). Since, as we have previously noted, the left-hand
ˆ
side of (4.0.49) converges to f (x) as t ↓ 0, we have thus shown that (f )∨ (x) = f (x).
ˆ
It can similarly be shown that (f ∨ )∧ (x) = f (x). This completes the proof of (4.0.43).

The next theorem plays a central role in many areas of PDE and analysis. It shows that the
Fourier transform preserves the L2 norm of functions.

i.e., the Fourier transform preserves the L2 inner product. In particular, by setting f = g , it fol lows
from (4.0.53) that

(4.0.54)

(cid:107)f (cid:107)L2 = (cid:107) ˆ

Proof. By applying (4.0.41) with g replaced by gˆ, we have that

(cid:104) ˆ
f , gˆ(cid:105) = (cid:104)f , (gˆ)∨ (cid:105).
(4.0.55)
By the Fourier inversion theorem (i.e. Theorem 4.1), we have that (gˆ)∨ = g , and so the right-hand
side of (4.0.55) is equal to

(4.0.56)

We have thus shown (4.0.53).
