Class Meeting # 24: Transport Equations and Burger’s Equation
In these notes, we introduce a class of evolution PDEs known as transport equations. Such
equations arise in a physical context whenever a quantity is “transported” in a certain direction.
Some important physical examples include the mass density ﬂow for an incompressible ﬂuid, and
the Boltzmann equation of kinetic theory. We discuss both linear transport equations and a famous
nonlinear transport equation known as Burger’s equation. One of our ma jor goals is to show that
in contrast to the case of linear PDEs, solutions to Burger’s equations can develop singularities in
ﬁnite time.

Linear homogeneous transport equations are PDEs of the form

1. Transport Equations

X µ∂µu = 0,
(1.0.1)
where (x0 , x1 , · · · , xn ) are coordinates on R1+n and X (x0 , · · · , xn ) is a vectorﬁeld on R1+n . As we
will soon see, the transport equation is closely connected to the following system of ODEs for the
unknowns γ µ :

(µ = 0, 1, · · · , n).
γ µ (s) = X µ (γ 0 (s), γ 1 (s), · · · , γ n (s)),

Given initial conditions γ µ (0), the solutions to (1.0.2) are curves γ : I → R1+n , where I is an interval.
These curves are known as the integral curves of the vectorﬁeld X. They are also known as the
characteristic curves associated to the PDE (1.0.1). The next proposition clariﬁes the connection
between the transport equation (1.0.1) and its characteristic curves.

Proposition 1.0.1 (Connection between transport equations and ODEs). If u solves the
transport equation (1.0.1), then u is constant along the integral curves of X. More precisely, if γ (s)

of X are constant. That is, we assume that

In this case, the solutions to the system (1.0.2) of ODEs are the straight lines

γ (s) = ˚γ + sX,

where ˚γ = γ (0) is a constant vector.
For concreteness, let’s also assume that

and as usual, let’s use the alternate notation x0 = t. Let’s assume that we are given Cauchy data
for u on the hypersurface {t = 0} × Rn :

u(0, x1 , . . . , xn ) = f (x1 , · · · , xn ),
(1.1.4)
where f is a function on Rn . We now note that

(t, x1 , · · · , xn ) = (0, x1 − tX , · · · , xn − tX ) + tX,

(1.1.5)
which implies that the spacetime point (t, x1 , · · · , xn ) lies on the characteristic curve γ (t) passing
through the “initial” point (0, x1 − tX , · · · , xn − tX ) ⊂ {t = 0} × Rn . Therefore, by Proposition

and we have explicitly solved the PDE (1.0.1).

2. A Nonlinear Scalar PDE: Burger’s (Inviscid) Equation

Burger’s equation is a simple nonlinear PDE in 1+ 1 dimensions. It is often used to illustrate some
important features of (some) nonlinear PDEs. As we will see, it can be viewed as a nonlinear version
of the transport equation. Our main goal in these next two sections is to illustrate a phenomenon
not found in linear PDEs : the formation of a singularity in the solution.
Burger’s equation is the following PDE for the function u(t, x) :

(2.0.7)

∂tu + u∂xu = 0,

(t, x) ∈ [0, ∞) × R.
As we will see, the Cauchy problem (i.e., the initial value problem in which the datum u(0, x) is
prescribed) for (2.0.7) is well-posed.
Equation (2.0.7) is a simple example of a nonlinear conservation law. More precisely, the next
proposition shows that under suitable assumptions, the spatial L2 norm of solutions to (2.0.7) is
preserved in time.

Proposition 2.0.1 (Burger’s equation is a conservation law). Let T ≥ 0, and let u(t, x) be
def= [0, T ] × R. Assume that for each ﬁxed t ∈ [0, T ], we have that

a C 1 solution to (2.0.7) on ST

i.e., the spatial L2 norm of u(t, ·) is preserved in time.

Integrating (2.0.9) over R, using the Fundamental Theorem of calculus and the assumption on the
behavior of u(t, x) as x → ±∞, and “un-diﬀerentiating” under the integral, we deduce that

|u(t, x)|2 dx = 0.

The proposition now follows from (2.0.10).

(cid:3)

Notice that (2.0.7) can be viewed as as a transport equation whose speed and direction depend on
the solution u itself. As in the case of transport equations, we can deﬁne the characteristic curves
associated to a solution of (2.0.7).

Deﬁnition 2.0.1. Let u be a solution of (2.0.7). The characteristic curves associated to u are the
solutions to the following system of ODEs:

(2.0.11a)

(2.0.11b)

d
ds
d
ds
Remark 2.0.1. Equation (2.0.11a) shows that γ 0 (s) = s + c, where c is a constant. There is no
loss of generality in parameterizing the curve with the constant c set equal to 0.

γ 0 = 1,
γ 1 = u ◦ γ = u(γ 0 (s), γ 1 (s)).

The next two propositions are essential for our analysis of Burger’s equation.

Proposition 2.0.2 (Burger solutions are constant along characteristics). C 1 solutions to
(2.0.7) are constant along the characteristic curves (2.0.11a) - (2.0.11b).

Proof. Using the chain rule and the equations (2.0.7), (2.0.11a) - (2.0.11b), we compute that

(2.0.12)

[u ◦ γ (s)] = (∂tu)|γ

γ 1 = (∂tu)|γ + u|γ (∂xu)|γ = 0.

Proposition 2.0.3 (Burger characteristics are straight lines). The characteristic curves
(2.0.11a) - (2.0.11b) are straight lines in R1+1 .

Furthermore, using the ODE (2.0.11b) and the computation (2.0.12), we compute that

3. “Solving” Burger’s equation

Using the propositions from the previous section, will now exhibit an implicit solution to the
following initial value problem for Burger’s equation:

(3.0.15)

(t, x) ∈ [0, ∞) × R,
x ∈ R.
Theorem 3.1. Let u be a C 1 solution to (3.0.15), and let (t, x) be a spacetime point. With (t, x)
ﬁxed, assume that the implicit equation x = p + f (p)t in the unknown p has a unique solution. Then

∂tu + u∂xu = 0,
u(0, x) = f (x),

(3.0.16)

u(t, x) = f (p).

Proof. Let γ (s) = (γ 0 (s), γ 1 (s)) denote the characteristic curve passing through the Cartesian (t, x)
spacetime point (0, p) when s = 0, i.e., (γ 0 (0), γ 1 (0)) = (0, p). According to the ODEs (2.0.11a)
0
- (2.0.11b) and Proposition 2.0.3, γ (s) is a straight line with constant “t/x” slope γ˙ (0)
γ˙ 1 = 1 . It
(0)
f (p)
therefore follows that

(3.0.17)

(3.0.18)

γ 0 (s) = s,
γ 1 (s) = p + f (p)s.

Consequently, by Proposition 2.0.2, we have that

(3.0.19)

u(s, p + f (p)s) = u(0, p) = f (p).

Equation (3.0.16) thus follows.

(cid:3)

4. Formation of Singularities

Proposition 2.0.1 shows that the spatial L2 norm of nice solutions to Burger’s equation is preserved
in time. This conserved quantity suggests that the solution can never grow large and therefore that
the solution should exist for all time. However, this intuition is false! The next theorem shows that
even though the L2 norm is preserved, the solution can develop a singularity in ﬁnite time, even if
the initial datum f is very smal l and very nice.

Theorem 4.1 (Sharp Characterization of Singularity Formation in Burger’s Equation).
Let f ∈ C 1 (R) be initial data for Burger’s equation (3.0.15). Then the corresponding solution u(t, x)
remains C 1 for al l (t, x) ∈ [0, ∞) × R if and only if f (cid:48) (x) ≥ 0 holds for al l x ∈ R.
Proof. Suppose that there exists a point x0 such that f (cid:48) (x0 ) < 0. Then there exists a nearby
point x1 > x0 with f (x1 ) < f (x0 ). Let γ(xi ) (s) denote the characteristic curve passing through
the spacetime point (0, xi ) at s = 0. Then by Proposition 2.0.2, u ◦ γ(xi ) (s) = f (xi ) for all s ≥
