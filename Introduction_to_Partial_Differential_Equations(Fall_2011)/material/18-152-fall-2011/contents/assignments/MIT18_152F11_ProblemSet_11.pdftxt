Remark 0.0.1. The special case V (φ) = κ φ2 leads to the Klein-Gordon equation. The
parameter κ ≥ 0 is known as the mass, so that the standard linear wave equation is the

“massless” Klein-Gordon equation.

IV. Let x = (x0 , · · · , xn ) denote standard coordinates on R1+n . Let Y : R1+n → R1+n be a
smooth vectorﬁeld. For each suﬃciently small || consider the change of coordinates x

b)Let K be a compact subset of spacetime with a smooth boundary, and let φ be a C 2 solution to
(0.0.8). Let Y be a smooth vectorﬁeld, and assume that (0.0.13) holds for x ∈ K. Revisit the proof
of the theorem from class in which we derived the divergence-free property of the energy-momentum
(cid:90)
tensor. In particular, recall that in the proof, we showed that

c) Explain how the identity (0.0.15) can

d) Let φ(t, x1 , · · · , xn ) be a C 2 solution to (0.0.7) (note that we are using the alternate notation
t = x0 ). For simplicity, assume that φ(t, ·) is compactly supported for each ﬁxed t. Using (0.0.15)

j=1 (∇j φ)2 is the Euclidean norm of the spacetime
gradient of φ, and dnx = dx1dx2 · · · dxn denotes
integration over the spatial variables (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ).

Remark 0.0.2. This problem shows that “continuous symmetries” (generated by a ﬂow vector-
ﬁeld Y ) of the Lagrangian generate conserved quantities for solutions to the corresponding Euler-
Lagrange equation. The principle that a symmetry of a diﬀerential equation leads to a conservation
law is widely applicable. The original ideas go back to Emmy Noether, who published a theorem
(known as Noether’s theorem) in 1918 containing the ﬁrst general application of these methods.
The modern point of view, which was established earlier in the course, is to study the properties of
def
the vectorﬁelds of the form J µ = T µν Xν for a larger class of X than the ones that correspond to
exact symmetries. This modern point of view is therefore a descendant of Noether’s theorem.
