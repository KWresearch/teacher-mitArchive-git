Problem Set 10, Due: at the start of class on 12-1-11
I. Let f : Rn → R be a smooth, compactly supported function. Let u : R1+n → R be the
corresponding smooth solution to the global Cauchy problem for the heat equation on R1+n :

(t, x) ∈ (0, ∞) × Rn ,
x ∈ Rn .

−∂tu(t, x) + ∆u(t, x) = 0,
u(0, x) = f (x),
(cid:90)

def
uˆ(t, ξ ) =

e−2πiξ ·xu(t, x) dnx

a) Let

be the spatial Fourier transform of u. Show that for each ﬁxed ξ , uˆ(t, ξ ) is a solution to the
ODE

with initial conditions

∂tuˆ(t, ξ ) = −4π 2 |ξ |2uˆ(t, ξ )

(0.0.5)

ˆ
uˆ(0, ξ ) = f (ξ ).
b) Integrate the ODE (0.0.4) and use (0.0.5) to conclude that for t ≥ 0, we have

(0.0.6)

uˆ(t, ξ ) = f (ξ )e−4tπ |ξ | .

(4π t)n/2

e−x2 /(4t) def= Γ(t, x).

d) Finally, using the basic properties of the Fourier transform, show that for any t > 0, we
have

(0.0.9)

u(t, x) = (Γ(t, ·) ∗ f (·))(x),
where ∗ denotes convolution.

Remark 0.0.1. Γ(t, x) is exactly the fundamental solution to the heat equation when the
diﬀusion constant D is equal to 1. Equation (0.0.9) is the same convolution formula for the
solution to the heat equation that we derived earlier in the course. Thus, the the above
argument, which heavily depends on the properties of the Fourier transform, oﬀers us an
alternative derivation of the fundamental solution for the heat equation.
II. Let f : R → R be a smooth, compactly supported function.

c) Use part b), basic properties properties of the Fourier transform, and Plancherel’s theorem
to conclude that

(0.0.12)

(cid:107)f (cid:107)2
L2 ≤ 4π(cid:107)xf (cid:107)L2 (cid:107) ˆξf (cid:107)L2 .
Remark 0.0.2. Inequality (0.0.12) is one version of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.
ˆ
Roughly speaking, it shows that f and f cannot simultaneously be localized around the
origin (because a simultaneous localization would force the right-hand side of (0.0.12) to be
ˆ
smaller than it is allowed to be). With a little more work, it can be shown that f and f
cannot simultaneously be localized around any point.
III. Let f : R → C be a smooth, compactly supported function.
a) Let R > 0 be a real number. Show that the series

Then explain why the series (0.0.16) converges absolutely and uniformly for ξ ∈ (−R, R).

Remark 0.0.3. In particular, this shows that f (ξ ) is analytic (i.e., it has a convergent
power series representation) for ξ ∈ (
−R, R). Since R > 0 was arbitrary, this shows that
f (ξ ) is analytic on all of R.

c) Brieﬂy explain why f (ξ ) cannot be compactly supported unless f (ξ ) ≡ 0.

Remark 0.0.4. In fact, more is true: f (ξ ) cannot vanish on any open set.

Hint: How many analytic functions are there that vanish on an open set?
IV. Let φ : Rn → C be a smooth, compactly supported function. Let f : R1+n → C be a smooth
function such that for each ﬁxed t, f (t, x) is a compactly supported function of x. Consider
the following global Cauchy problem for an inhomogeneous Schr¨odinger equation:

(t, x) ∈ (0, ∞) × Rn ,
