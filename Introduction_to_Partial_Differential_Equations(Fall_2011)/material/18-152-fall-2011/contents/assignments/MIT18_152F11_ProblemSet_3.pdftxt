Problem Set 3, Due: at the start of class on 9-29-11
I. Let S = (0, ∞) × (0, 1), and let u ∈ C 1,2 (S ) be the solution of the initial-boundary value
def
 ∂tu − ∂ 2
problem
(t, x) ∈ (0, ∞) × (0, 1),
 u(0, x) = x(1 − x),
xu = 0,
x ∈ [0, 1],
t ∈ (0, ∞).
u(t, 0) = 0,
u(t, 1) = 0,
Show that u(t, x) = u(t, 1 − x) holds for all t ≥ 0 and all x ∈ [0, 1].
II. Let S = (0, ∞) × (0, 1), and let u ∈ C 1,2 (S ) ∩ C (S ) be the solution of the initial-boundary

value problem  ∂tu − ∂ 2
(t, x) ∈ S,
 u(0, x) = x(1 − x),
xu = 0,
x ∈ [0, 1],
t ∈ (0, ∞).
u(t, 0) = u(t, 1) = some constant,
First prove that u(t, x) ≥ 0 for (t, x) ∈ S (all the information you need to prove this has been
given to you). Then ﬁnd all numbers α > 0 and β > 0 such that the following inequality
holds on S :

(0.0.1)

w(t, x) = αx(1 − x)e−βt .
u(t, x) ≤
def
Hint: Apply the maximum principle twice, once for u, and again for w − u.
Finally, use (0.0.1) to deduce that u(t, x) → 0 as t → 0 and that the convergence is uniform
in x for x ∈ [0, 1].
III. Problem 2.13 pg. 99.
IV. Problem 2.14 pg. 99. You can interpret the word “explicit” to mean that your solution is
allowed to involve the standard fundamental solution for the heat equation.
V. In this problem you will consider PDEs on the set (t, x) ∈ [0, ∞) × Rn . You may assume
operator of the form L = ∂t + L(cid:101), where L(cid:101) is a linear diﬀerential operator acting on the
that all of the functions involved are suﬃciently diﬀerentiable. Let L be a linear diﬀerential
spatial variables alone (for example, L(cid:101) = −∆, as in the heat equation). Suppose that we
know how to solve all homogeneous initial value problems

(0.0.2)

Lu(t, x) = 0,
u(0, x) = f (t, x)

(t, x) ∈ [0, ∞) × Rn
x ∈ Rn .
Suppose that we now want to solve the corresponding inhomogeneous problem with 0 data:

(0.0.3)

(0.0.4)

MATH 18.152 - PROBLEM SET 3

Lv(t, x) = f (t, x),
v(0, x) = 0

(t, x) ∈ [0, ∞) × Rn ,
x ∈ Rn .

Show that a solution to (0.0.3) is

(cid:90)
s=0
where each v(s) is the solution to the following homogeneous initial value problem:

v(t, x) =

s, x) ds,

v(s) (t

t

(0.0.5)

(t, x) ∈ [0, ∞) × R ,
Lv
n
(s) (t, x) = 0,
x ∈ Rn .
v(s) (0, x) = f (s, x),
Note that in the PDE (0.0.5), s plays the role of a constant, whereas in equation (0.0.4),
it plays the role of an integration variable. The formula (0.0.4) is known as Duhamel’s
principle.
Hint: Try directly showing that v(t, x) has the correct initial condition and that it solves
(0.0.3). You will have to make use of the fundamental theorem of calculus, and also diﬀeren-
tiation under the integral; you may assume that the conditions necessary for diﬀerentiating
under the integral are satisﬁed.
VI. Use the previous problem to show that a solution to the inhomogeneous heat equation

(0.0.6)

(0.0.7)

∂tu − D∆u = f (t, x),
u(0, x) = g(x),

(t, x) ∈ [0, ∞) × Rn ,
x ∈ Rn

t

is

u(t, x) = (ΓD (t, ·) ∗ g(·))(x) +

(cid:90)
0
where ΓD (t, x) is the fundamental solution introduced in class. Assume whatever conditions
you need on f and g in order for your solution to be well-deﬁned.
Hint: Show that the solution to (0.0.6) can be split into two pieces: u = uhom + uinhom ,
where uhom solves the homogeneous heat equation with correct data uhom (0, x) = g(x), and
uinhom solves the correct equation ∂tuinhom − D∆uinhom = f (t, x) with data uimhom (0, x) = 0.
Then handle each piece separately. This is a very standard technique for dissecting the
solution of an inhomogeneous linear PDE into two parts.

·))(x) ds,
