18.152 Introduction to PDEs, Fall 2011

Professor: Jared Speck

Problem Set 4, Due: at the start of class on 10-6-11
I. Problem 3.1 on pg. 150.
II. Problem 3.2 on pg. 150.
III. Problem 3.3 on pg. 151. You may assume that u ∈ C 3 (Ω) ∩ C 1 (Ω).
IV. Problem 3.4 on pg. 151.
V. Problem 3.8 on pg. 152.
VI. Let B1 (0) denote the solid unit ball in Rn , and let ∂B1 (0) denote its boundary. Let f (x) be
smooth (i.e., inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable) function on B1 (0), let g(σ) be a smooth function on
∂B1 (0), and let u(x) be a smooth solution to

x ∈ B1 (0),
∆u(x) = f (x),
σ ∈ ∂B1 (0).
u(σ) = g(σ),

(cid:1)
Show that there exists a constant C > 0 which does not depend on f or g such that
|u(x)| ≤ C max |f (x)| + max |g(σ)| .

Hint: Revisit the proof of the Mean value properties discussed in class.
