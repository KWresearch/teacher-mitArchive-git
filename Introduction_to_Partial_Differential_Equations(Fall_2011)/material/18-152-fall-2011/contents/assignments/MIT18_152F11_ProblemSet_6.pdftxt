In (0.0.6), N(σ) is the unit outward normal to Mt,p;R .
Remark 0.0.1. In the near future, we will discuss the geometry of Minkowski spacetime,
which is intimately connected to the linear wave equation. Our study will lead to a geomet-
rically motivated construction of the vectorﬁeld J and the identity (0.0.6). Alternatively,
the identity (0.0.6) could also be derived by multiplying both sides of equation (0.0.1a) by
−∂tu, then integrating by parts and using the divergence theorem.
a) Show that the unit outward normal N(σ) to Mt,p;R is of the form

c) Then show that if the functions f (x) and g(x) from (0.0.1b) - (0.0.1c) are both smooth
and vanish outside of the ball BR0 (p) ⊂ Rn , then at each time t ≥ 0, the solution u(t, x) to
(0.0.1a) vanishes outside of the ball BR0+t (p).
d) Finally, under the same assumptions on f and g , let R → ∞ in (0.0.8) (and also use

In Problem II, you used energy methods to prove that E (t) is conserved: E (t) = E (0) for
all t ≥ 0. Now show that if t is large enough, then P 2 (t) = K 2 (t) = 1 E 2 (t). This is called

the equipartitioning of the energy.
then the desired equipartitioning result should boil down to proving that (cid:82) (∂q u(t, x))(∂su(t, x)) dx =
Hint: Try expressing P (t) and K (t) in terms of the nul l derivatives ∂q u(t, x) and ∂su(t, x)
that we used in the proof of d’Alembert’s formula. If you set up the calculations properly,

for ∂q u(t, x) and ∂su(t, x) that we derived in terms of f , g during that proof, and make use
of the assumptions on f , g .
