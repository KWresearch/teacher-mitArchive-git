basic facts from Fourier analysis” theorem discussed in class.

Remark 0.0.1. This problem shows that even though there is a pointwise discontinuity at
(0, 1), the solution is nonetheless “continuous in t at t = 0” with respect to the L2 ([0, 1])
spatial norm.
IV. Let (cid:96) > 0 be a positive real number. Let S = (0, ∞) × (0, (cid:96)), and let u(t, x) ∈ C 1,2 (S ) be

In this problem, you will use the energy method to show that the spatial L2 norm of u
decays exponentially

The special solution u(t, x) will be known as the fundamental solution, and it plays a
very important role in the theory of the heat equation on (0, ∞) × R. We demand that our
• (cid:82) u(t, x) dx = 1 for all t > 0
fundamental solution u(t, x) should have the following properties:
• u(t, x) ≥ 0

u(t, x) = 0 for all t > 0
• u(t, x) = u(t, −x) for all t > 0
To see that such a solution exists, ﬁrst make the assumption that u(t, x) = √1 V (ζ ),
