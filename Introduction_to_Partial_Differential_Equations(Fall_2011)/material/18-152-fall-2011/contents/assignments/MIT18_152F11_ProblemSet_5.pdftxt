I. Let B1 (0) denote the solid open unit ball in R3 , and let ∂B1 (0) denote its boundary. Recall
that the Green function G(x, y) for B1 (0) satisﬁes

Using (0.0.1a), directly show that G(x, y) ≤ 0 holds for all x, y ∈ B1 (0).
II. Let B1 (0) denote the solid open unit ball in R3 , and let ∂B1 (0) denote its boundary. Let f (x)
be smooth (i.e., inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable) function on B1 (0), let g(σ) be a smooth function
on ∂B1 (0), and let u(x) be the unique smooth solution to

III. Let u(x) be a harmonic function on R3 , and assume that u(x)
ln( x + 1) holds for all

Hint: For each ﬁxed R > 0, consider the function v(x) = u(x) + ln(R + 1). Since v is
non-negative, for each ﬁxed |x| ≤ R, you can apply Harnack’s inequality to v(x) on the
domain BR (0). Then you can allow R → ∞ in Harnack’s inequality, and with the help of
L’Hˆopital’s rule, you should be able to reach the desired conclusion.

Remark 0.0.1. Roughly speaking, this problem shows that the non-constant harmonic
functions are not allowed to grow at merely the very slow rate ln(|x| + 1) as |x| → ∞.
IV. Problem 3.14 on pg. 153.
Hint: In addition to the hints for part a) given in the book (which are leading you towards
the comparison principle for harmonic functions), also use the fact that G(x, y) → −∞ as
y → x, for each ﬁxed x ∈ Ω. This fact follows from the expression G(x, y) = Φ(x−y)−φ(x, y),
from the fact that |φ(x, y)| is uniformly bounded for y near x, and from the fact that
Φ(x − y) → −∞ as y → x; this last fact follows from the expression for Φ(x − y) given in
class.
For part b), use the following strategy, which diﬀers from the one in your book: for each
pair of points a, b ∈ Ω, deﬁne u(x) = G(x, a) and v(x) = G(x, b). Apply Green’s identity to
u, v on the domain Ω = Ω\(B (a) ∪ B (b)). Notice that if  is small, then u, v are harmonic
def
on Ω and that ∂Ω = ∂Ω ∪ −∂B (a) ∪ −∂B (b). Then let  ↓ 0. In applying Green’s identity,
you will have to handle 3 surface integrals: over ∂Ω, ∂B (a), and ∂B (b). The ﬁrst surface
integral should be 0, the second should converge to v(a) as  ↓ 0, and the third should
converge to −u(b). The ﬁnal conclusion should be that v(a) = u(b). You will also need to
use some of the calculations that we did for the proof of the “Representation formula
for u” Proposition in class, as well as the fact that |φ(x, y)| and |∇φ(x, y)| are uniformly
bounded for y near x.

Remark 0.0.2. Note that for some of the quantities we deﬁned in class (such as the fun-
damental solution), we have chosen the opposite sign convention compared to the one in
your book. For the sake of consistency, use the sign conventions we introduced in class. In
particular, for part a), you should prove that G(x, y) < 0.

V. Problem 3.21 on pg. 155. Hint: For part a), use the fact that for a spherically symmetric
function φ deﬁned on R3 , ∆φ = ∂ 2φ + 2
φ. Then the problem can be reduced to solving a
r
r
simple ODE for the quantity rφ.
For part b), revisit the proof of the theorem from Class Meeting # 7 in which we solved
Poisson’s equation in Rn .
Remark 0.0.3. In part a), you are deriving a fundamental solution for the Helmholtz
equation, up to a constant factor c. In part b), you are ﬁnding the correct constant c.
