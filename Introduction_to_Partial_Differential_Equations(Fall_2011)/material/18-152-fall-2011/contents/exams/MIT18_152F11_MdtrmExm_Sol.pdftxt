w(x) = B sin(

|λ|x),

where A, B are constants,

λ = m2π 2 ,
and m ≥ 0 is an integer. Thus, we have derived an inﬁnite family of solutions

t sin(mπx).

Let n > 0 be any integer, and consider the initial datum f (x) =  sin(nπx), where  > 0
is a small number. Then this function satisﬁes maxx∈[0,1] |f (x)| ≤ , Am =  if m = n, and
Am = 0 otherwise. Thus, the corresponding solution is

u(t, x) = en2 π2

t sin(nπx).

At time t = 1, the amplitude of this solution has grown to en2 π2 . Thus, by choosing n to
be large, at t = 1, the solution can be arbitrarily large, even though the datum satisﬁes
maxx [0,1] |f (x)
| ≤ .

In contrast, when f = 0, the solution remains 0 for all time. Thus, arbitrarily small
changes in the data can lead to arbitrarily large changes in the solution, and the backwards
heat equation is therefore not wel l posed (i.e. it is il l-posed ). This is in complete contrast to
the ordinary heat equation, which is well-posed. For the ordinary heat equation, the Fourier
modes exponentially deca√ y in time (as opposed to the exponential growth from (9)).
II. Deﬁne v(x) = u(x) + R. Then ∆v = 0, and v(x) ≥ 0 for x ∈ BR (0). Thus by Harnack’s

For a ﬁxed x, we let R

Thus,

0 ≤ u(x) ≤ 0.

u(x) = 0.

III. Let (t0 , x0 ) be the point in [0, 2] × [0, 1] at which u achieves its max. We will show that
u(t0 , x0 ) ≤ 0, which implies the desired conclusion.
If t0 = 0, x0 = 0, or x0 = 1, then the conditions on f , g , h immediately imply that
u(t0 , x0 ) ≤ 0, and we are done. So let us assume that none of these cases occur.
If t0 = 2, then by the above remarks we can assume that x0 ∈ (0, 1). Then ∂tu(2, x0 ) ≥ 0,
since otherwise we could slightly decrease t0 and cause the value of u to increase, which con-
tradicts the deﬁnition of a max. Also, by standard calculus, we must have that ∂xu(2, x0 ) =
xu(2, x0 ) ≤ 0 at the max. Thus,
0, and by Taylor expanding, we can conclude that ∂ 2
∂tu(2, x0 ) − ∂ 2
xu(2, x0 ) ≥ 0. Using the PDE, we thus conclude that −u(2, x0 ) ≥ 0, and
we are done.
For the ﬁnal case, we assume that 0 < t0 < 2 and x0 ∈ (0, 1). Then by standard calculus,
xu(t0 , x0 ) ≤ 0 at the max.
∂tu(t0 , x0 ) = 0 at the max. Also, as above, by standard calculus ∂ 2
Thus, ∂tu(t0 , x0 ) − ∂ 2
xu(t0 , x0 ) ≥ 0. Using the PDE, we thus conclude that −u(t0 , x0 ) ≥ 0,
and we are again done.

b) (2 pts.)
Our previous studies of the heat equation have suggested that solutions to the heat equa-
tion tend to rapidly settle down to constant states as t → ∞. Since the thermal energy is
preserved in time, if u converges to a constant C, then it must be the case that

Now (16) implies that at each ﬁxed t, there must exist a spatial point x0 such that
w(t, x0 ) = 0; otherwise, w(t, ·) would be strictly positive or negative in x, and therefore
(16) could not hold. Using the fundamental theorem of calculus and the Cauchy-Schwarz
