Answer questions I - VII below. The point values are listed in the table above.
Partial credit may be awarded, but only if you show all of your work and it is in
a logical order.
In order to receive credit, whenever you make use of a theorem/
proposition, make sure that you state it by name. Also, clearly state the hypotheses
that are needed to the apply theorem/ proposition, and explain why the hypotheses
are satisﬁed. You are allowed to use one handwritten page of notes (the front and back
of an 8.5 × 11 inch sheet of white printer paper). No other books, notes, or calculators
are allowed.
