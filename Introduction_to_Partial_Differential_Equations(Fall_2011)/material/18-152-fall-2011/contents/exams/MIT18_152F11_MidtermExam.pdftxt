18.152 Introduction to PDEs, Fall 2011

Professor: Jared Speck

Midterm Exam, Thursday, October 27

Answer questions I - V below. Each question is worth 20 points, for a total of
100. Partial credit may be awarded, but only if you show all of your work and it is
in a logical order. In order to receive credit, whenever you make use of a theorem/
proposition, make sure that you state it by name. Also, clearly state the hypotheses
that are needed to the apply theorem/ proposition, and explain why the hypotheses
are satisﬁed.

I. Consider the initial/boundary-value problem for the “backwards heat equation” (note carefully
the minus sign) in one spatial dimension:

(1)

(t, x) ∈ [0, 1] × [0, 1].
∂tu = −∂ 2
xu,
a) (8 pts.) Use the separation of variables method to ﬁnd all solutions to the PDE (1) of the form
u(t, x) = v(t)w(x) that satisfy the boundary conditions u(t, 0) = 0 and u(t, 1) = 0 for t ∈ [0, 1].
b) (12 pts.) Let f (x) be a smooth (i.e., inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable) function on [0, 1] with f (0) = f (1) =
0. Discuss the behavior of the solution u(t, x) to the following initial/boundary-value problem:

(2a)

(2b)

∂tu = −∂ 2
xu,
u(0, x) = f (x),

(t, x) ∈ [0, 1] × [0, 1],
x ∈ [0, 1],
t ∈ [0, 1].
u(t, 1) = 0,
u(t, 0) = 0,
(2c)
In particular, under the assumption maxx [0,1] |f (x)| ≤ , where  is a small positive number, explain
∈
what conclusions can be reached about the “size” of the solution at time t = 1. The term “size” is
deﬁned here to be maxx [0,1] |u(t, x)|. Compare/contrast this behavior with the case f = 0 (in which
∈
case the solution is u(t, x) = 0 for (t, x) ∈ [0, 1] × [0, 1]). In addition, compare/contrast the behavior
with the behavior of the corresponding solutions that arise when equation (2a) is replaced with the
ordinary heat equation ∂tu = ∂ 2
xu. Finally, explain how your previous remarks are connected to the
question of the well-posedness of the problem (2a) - (2c).

II. Let u ∈ C ∞ (R3 ) be a harmonic function on R3 :

III. Let u(t, x) ∈ C 1,2 ([0, 2] × [0, 1]) be a solution to the following initial/boundary-value problem:

(3)

∂tu − ∂ 2
xu = −u,
u(0, x) = f (x),

(t, x) ∈ [0, 2] × [0, 1],
x ∈ [0, 1],
t ∈ [0, 2].
u(t, 1) = h(t),
u(t, 0) = g(t),
Assume that f (x) ≤ 0 for x ∈ [0, 1] and that g(t) ≤ 0, h(t) ≤ 0 for t ∈ [0, 2]. Prove that u(t, x) ≤ 0
holds for all (t, x) ∈ [0, 2] × [0, 1].
Hint: One possible approach would be to revisit the proof of the maximum principle for the heat
equation.

(4)

t ∈ [0, ∞).

∂tu − ∂ 2

[0,1]
a) (6 pts.) Show that under the above assumptions, T (t) is constant in time: T (t) = T (0) for all
t ≥ 0.
b) (2 pts.) Using your physical and mathematical intuition, make an educated guess about what
happens to u(t, x) as t → ∞. In particular, relate your guess to an integral of the data f (x).
c) (12 pts.) Rigorously prove that your guess from part b) is correct.

Remark 0.0.1. There are several diﬀerent ways to approach the proof of c), and the diﬀerent
approaches will lead to slightly diﬀerent, but related conclusions. In particular, your answer could
be stated using any one of several diﬀerent norms. You will receive full credit if you correctly
implement any of the approaches.
