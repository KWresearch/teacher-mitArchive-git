***** Readings *****
There is no required textbook for this course, however, the following textbooks
are recommended for reference:
[Amazon_logo] Hastie, T., R. Tibshirani, and J. H. Friedman. The Elements of
Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction. (Springer Series
in Statistics.) New York, NY: Springer Verlag, July 30, 2003. ISBN:

***** Prerequisites *****
Familiarity with SAS and MATLABÂ® will be helpful, and consultation with
respective user manuals may be necessary.
***** Grading *****
30% Homework
Homework's are due at the end of each module. They may require programming, and
all code must be included. They are to be solved individually. Homework's
received after the deadline may be subject to substantial grade penalty. No
homework's will be accepted after the solutions have been handled.
30% Midterm
The midterm will contain topics from decision analysis and machine learning.
There will be a strict time limit of 1.5 h. Students should bring class notes,
homework solutions, and readings.
40% Final Project
The final project has to be developed for this course and should be done
individually. Although the project may contain parts developed previously for
another purpose, it is essential that substantial effort be demonstrated into
developing a project specifically for this class. A final report in the form of
a 5+ page paper is expected, as well as a demonstration of the implementation
in the form of a 15 minute presentation. Students are advised to discuss their
projects with the instructors ahead of time. Examples of final reports will be
handled during the course.
