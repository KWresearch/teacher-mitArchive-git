Midterm HST951 - 2002                                                                         
 

•  This midterm has 4 main sections, each with a number of questions. Including this 

page, there are 8 numbered pages all in all. 

•  You have 90 minutes to complete the test. 
 
•  Each section has the same weight. 

•  Some questions may have more than one “right answer”.  

•  Make sure you answer as much as you can without wasting time.  

•  Use the back of the pages if answers don’t fit, and indicate so. 
 
•  Remember that the final project is the most important part of this course. 

•  We will use absolute and not relative performance to determine the grade in this 

midterm.  

•  There is no need to remind you about honor code. No group work please. 

•  Remember to identify yourself on the top of each page. 

•  Time is monkey… 

 
Good luck!

Section 3: General 
 
You are working in a clinical research lab when your boss approaches you with the 
following problem:  
 
"Our research partners have just sent us a data set collected during a recent study. They 
wanted to determine which patients respond to a new treatment procedure. Since the 
treatment is rather expensive, and not all patients respond favorably to it, they could save 
a lot of money, and improve quality of care, if they just subjected the right patients to the 
treatment. To determine which patients respond to treatment, they collected 20 pieces of 
information (variables) about each patient before applying the treatment, and then 
measured the patient's response to the treatment as a binary outcome (1=respond, 0=did 
not respond). They want us to help them build a model that allows them to determine 
whether a patient will respond to treatment based on the 20 measurements alone. 
Knowing that you covered problems like these in your medical decision support class, I 
told them I have just the person for the job. Perhaps we could try one of those algorithms 
I've been hearing so much about lately, logistic regression, rough sets, CART, neural 
networks or support vector machines?"  
 
Describe how you would go about tackling this problem (assume that you already have 
all the software you need). In the process, make sure you answer the following questions:  
 
Which of the algorithms do you use, and why? 
 
  
 
 
 
 
What are the parameters you need to tune to optimize the algorithm's performance?  
 
 
 
 
 
 
How do you tune them?

How do you know that your model generalizes well?  
 
 
 
 
 
 
How do you measure the performance of your model? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Can you tell which variables are more important for the classification?
