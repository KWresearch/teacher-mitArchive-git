Overview

• An example of a method for 
mining rough/fuzzy rules 
• Uncertainty revisited

Crisp Sets


• A set with a characteristic function 
is called crisp 
• Crisp sets are used to formally 
characterize a concept, e.g., even 
numbers 
• Crisp sets have clear cut 
boundaries, hence do not reflect 
uncertainty about membership 

HST 951 Spring 2003 

Fuzzy Sets 


•  Zadeh (1965) introduced “Fuzzy Sets”
where he replaced the characteristic
function with membership 
• c S: U ﬁ  {0,1} is replaced by 
mS : U ﬁ  [0,1] 
• Membership is a generalization of
characteristic function and gives a
“degree of membership” 
•  Successful applications in control
theoretic settings (appliances, gearbox) 

HST 951 Spring 2003 

Fuzzy Sets 

• Example: Let S be the set of 
people of normal height 
• Normality is clearly not a crisp 
concept

Crisp Characterizations of 

Fuzzy Sets

• Support in U 
SupportU(S) = {x ˛  U | mS(x) > 0} 
• Containment 
A ˝  B if and only if 
mA(x) £  mB(x) for all x ˛  U 
• There are non-crisp versions of the 
above 

HST 951 Spring 2003 

Fuzzy Set Operations 

• Union 
mA¨B(x) = max(mA(x), mB(x)) 
• Intersection 
mA˙B(x) = min(mA(x), mB(x)) 
• Complementation 
mU-A(x) = 1 - mA(x) 
• Note that other definitions exist 
too

Fuzzy Relations 

• The fuzzy relation R between Sets 
X and Y is a fuzzy set in the 
Cartesian product X·Y 
• mR: X·Y ﬁ  [0,1] gives the degree 
to which x and y are related to 
each other in R. 

HST 951 Spring 2003 

Composition of Relations


• Two fuzzy relations R in X·Y and S 
in Y·Z can be composed into R�S 
in X·Z as 
mR�S(x,z) = maxy˛Y[min[mR(x,y), mS(y,z)]]

Probabilities of Fuzzy  

Events

• “Probability of cold weather 
tomorrow” 
• U = {x1, x2, …, xn}, p is a 
probability density, A is a fuzzy set 
(event) in U 
P ( A) = � mA ( xi ) p( xi ) 
n 
i=1 

HST 951 Spring 2003 

 

Defuzzyfication


• Finding a single representative for 
a fuzzy set A in U = {xi|i in {1,…n}} 
• Max: x in U such that mA(x) is maximal 
• Center of gravity: 
n�i=1 ximA ( xi ) 
n�i=1 mA ( xi ) 

HST 951 Spring 2003 

Alpha Cuts 


• A is a fuzzy set in U 
• Aa  = {x | mA(x)‡ a  } is the a-cut of 
A in U 
• Strong a-cut is 
Aa  = {x | mA(x)> a  } 
• Alpha cuts are crisp sets 

HST 951 Spring 2003 

Fuzzy Logic 


• Different views 
– Foundation for reasoning based on 
uncertain statements 
– Foundation for reasoning based on 
uncertain statements where fuzzy set 
theoretic tools are used (original Zadeh) 
– As a multivalued logic with operations 
chosen in a special way that has some fuzzy 
interpretation 

HST 951 Spring 2003 

Fuzzy Logic 


• Generalization of proposition over 
a set 
• Let cS:U ﬁ  {0,1} denote the 
characteristic function of the set S 
• Recall that in “crisp” logic 
I(p(x)) = p(x) = cT(p)(x) 
where p is a proposition and T(p) is 
the corresponding truth set 

HST 951 Spring 2003 

Fuzzy Logic 

• We extend the proposition 
p:U ﬁ  {0,1} 
to be a fuzzy membership 
p:U ﬁ  [0,1] 
•  The fuzzy set associated with p 
corresponds to the truth set T(p) and 
p(x) is the degree of truth of p for x 
• We extend the interpretation of logical 
formulae analogously to the crisp case 

HST 951 Spring 2003 

Fuzzy Logic Sematics 

• Basic operations: 
– I(p(x)) = p(x) 
– I(a  v b) = max(I(a),I(b)) 
– I(a  ^ b) = min(I(a),I(b)) 
– I(~a) = 1 – I(a) 

HST 951 Spring 2003 

Fuzzy Logic Sematics 

• Implication: 
– Kleene-Dienes 
I(a  ﬁ  b) = max(I(~a),I(b)) 
• Dubois and Prade (1992) analyze 
other definitions of Implications 
– Zadeh 
I(a  ﬁ  b) = max(I(~a),min(I(a), I(b))) 

HST 951 Spring 2003 

Fuzzy Rules


•  “If x in A then y in B” is a relation R 
between A and B 
•  Two model types 
– Implicative: (x in A ﬁ  y in B) is an upper bound 
– Conjunctive: (x in A ^ y in B) is a lower 
bound 
– Crisp motivation: 
cA(x) ^ cB(y) £ cR(x,y) £  (1 - cA(x)) v cB(y) 

HST 951 Spring 2003 

Conjunctive Rule application


• R:U·U ﬁ  [0,1] is a rule 
If p(x) then q(y) 
• Using a generalized Modus Ponens 
A’ 
A ﬁ  B 
B’ 
we get that 
B’ = A’ �  R 
B’(y) = maxx[min[A’(x),R(x,y)]] 

HST 951 Spring 2003 

Rough Sets 

• Pawlak 1982 
• Approximation of sets using a 
collection of sets. 
• Related to fuzzy sets (Zadeh 
1965), in that both can be viewed 
as representations of uncertainty 
regarding set membership.

•  Approximation of D by {C1, C2, C3, C4}: 
–  C1  definitely outside 
–  C3  definitely inside: lower approximation 
–  C2  ¨  C4  are boundary 
–  C2  ¨  C3  ¨  C4 are upper approximation 
HST 951 Spring 2003 

Rough Set: Set Approximation


• Given a collection of sets C={C1, C2, C3,…} 
and a set D, we define: 
– Lower approximation of D by C, 
D L  = UC i  such  that  C i 
˙ D  = C i 
– Upper approximation of D by C, 
˙ D  „ ˘ 
D U  = UC i  such  that  C i 
– Boundary of D by C, 
=  D U  - D L 
UD L 

HST 951 Spring 2003 

Rough Set: Definition


• A set D is rough with respect to a 
collection of sets C if it has a non-
empty boundary when 
approximated by C. Otherwise it is 
crisp.

Minimal sets that have non-empty intersection with all

These are called reducts of (U,A)

A reduct is a minimal set of features that preserves the

Rough Sets: Extending d


•  Problem: we only have 
the d  value for 4 of 8 
possible input values. 
What is d(1,1,1) ? 
•	 By using compressed data 
that preserves the 
partition, we cover more 
of the feature space. All of 
it in this case. d(1,1,1) = 
d(1,1) = 2/3.

•	 Problem: extension not unique 
(and can extend to different 
parts of feature space). 
•  d(1,1,1) = d(1,1) = 1/3. 
•	 Possible solution: generate 
several extensions and combine 
by voting. Generating all 
extensions is combinatorial. 
•  d(1,1,1) = (2/3 + 1/3)/2 =1/2

A Proposal for Mining  

Fuzzy Rules

•  Recipe: 
1.  Create rough information system by 
fuzzy discretization of data 
2.  Compute rough decision rules 
3.  Interpret rules as fuzzy rules 

HST 951 Spring 2003 

Fuzzy Discretization 

• A1, A2, …, An  are fuzzy sets in U 
• disc: U ﬁ  {1,2,...,n} 
(x) | j ˛  {1,2,...,n}} 
disc(x) = {i | mAi
(x) = max{mAj
• disc selects the index of the fuzzy 
set that yields the maximal 
membership 
• Information system: subject each 
attribute value to disc

Uncertainty


•  Fuzzy sets can be said to model 
inherent vagueness 
Bob is "tall" - vagueness in the meaning 
of "tall", not in Bob's height 
• Rough sets can be said to model 
ambiguity due to lack of information
