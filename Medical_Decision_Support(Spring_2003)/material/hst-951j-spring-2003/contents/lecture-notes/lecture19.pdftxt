Databases in Clinical Research

Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology
HST.951J: Medical Decision Support

Overview

• Background:  History and utility of clinical data
repositories

• Strategies:  Integrating the outcomes tracking
database into clinical workflow

• Brigham and Women’s Catheterization
Laboratory Database:  Architecture,
Advances, Limitations

• Examples of Data Exploration:  Risk models,
“drilling down”, and device safety monitoring

Need for Clinical Data Repositories

• Randomized clinical trials are gold
standard for testing a hypothesis, but
there are significant limitations:

•  generalizability

•  timeliness

•  cost $$$

Cost of Randomized Clinical Trials

•  Estimated cost of RCT:

® Drug Trial:  $15,000/patient

•  1000 patient trial: $15MM

•  Simply too expensive to answer every
relevent clinical question with prospective
blinded RCT.

Clinical Registries

• While RCT’s test hypotheses, the real world of
clinical practice is a registry.

 All patients (generalizability)
 Dynamic (timeliness)

• Significant Potential cost savings when
automated clinical registry (database system)
bundled with other functional requirements

 clinical reporting, billing, inventory control

History of Successful Clinical Registries

•  Duke Database

•  Washington Heart Center

•  Beth Israel Hospital, Boston

•  Cleveland Clinic

•  Mayo Clinic

•  Massachusetts General Hospital

Why Clinical Cardiology?

• High volume clinical sites

• High event rates – death, MI,
revascularization, rehospitalization, etc.

•  High profile

•  High cost to study

Applications of Clinical Databases:

• Clinical Research:
® Retrospective “Hypothesis Generator”
® Data mining
® Prospective automated CRF
® Risk prediction modeling
•  Quality Assurance:
® Interprovider variability
® Benchmark review – ACC NCDR

•  Business and Operations Review – Turnover
times, referral patterns

•  Regulatory Requirements – State DPH

• Strategies:  Integrating the outcomes tracking
database into clinical workflow

• Brigham and Women’s Catheterization Laboratory
Database:  Architecture, Advances, Issues

• Examples of Data Exploration:  Risk models,

Strategies for Maintaining Clinical db

Three Strategies:

• Prospective/retrospective off-line chart
review

•  Data extraction w/ supplemental chart
review

•  Complete integration into electronic
record system

Clinical Database Strategies:

Parallel
Chart Review

-- independent of clinical process
-- focus on data quality
-- maintain current workflow

-- requires team of coders
-- COST $$$

Hybrid
Strategy

Fully
Integrated

-- purely prospective
-- integral part of routine
        workflow
-- lowest cost (??)

-- data quality issues
-- data management

Databases:

• Clinical Outcomes Tracking Database:
® Retrospective Clinical Research
® Quality Assurance
® Administrative reporting
• Clinical report generation (structured
reporting; transcription templates)
• Technical and Professional Billing
• Inventory Management

• Increased complexity of database with each
additional functional layer.

•  Risk prediction models help adjust for severity of illness
_  providers assess quality of care – improve process
_  State / public compare institutions and providers
_  researchers assess effect of changes in care

Rules for Designing an Outcomes
Database

• Understand workflow in detail.  Identify immutable
points (most of these depend on perspective).

•  Incremental design – identify successful
milestones

•  Open architecture – use ODBC compliant
relational databases as backbone

® Systems integration is most complex
challenge

• Goal of distributed information availability.

•  Identify implementation team.  Responsiblities,
project plan, regular operational meeting.
