“Medicine and the Computer:

The Promise and Problems of Change” 


—W.B. Schwartz, NEJM 1970

(cid:216)  Perceived problems 
(cid:216)  Physician shortage and maldistribution 
(cid:216)  Ever-expanding body of knowledge, so that the physician 
cannot keep up 
(cid:216)  Exploit the computer as an “intellectual”, “deductive”

to Build Expert Systems 

(cid:216) Great cleverness 
(cid:216) Powerful inference abilities 
(cid:216) Ab initio  reasoning 

(cid:216) Great stores of knowledge 
(cid:216) Possibly limited ability to infer, but

easy-to-apply form

How to do diagnosis (medical 
reasoning)? 

(cid:216) Program it 
(cid:216) use a flowchart (since 1950’s) 
(cid:216) use rules (since 1970’s) 
(cid:216) Deduce it 
(cid:216) use some representation of disease and a diagnostic 
algorithm 
(cid:216)disease/symptom associations (since 1960’s)

How Mycin Works 

(cid:216)  To find out a fact 
(cid:216) If there are rules that can conclude it, try them 
(cid:216) Ask the user 
(cid:216)  To “run” a rule 
(cid:216) Try to find out if the facts in the premises are true 
(cid:216) If they all are, then assert the conclusion(s), with 
a suitable certainty 
(cid:216)  Backward chaining from goal to given facts 

(cid:216)  Dynamically traces out behavior of (what might be) a 

flowchart 
(cid:216) Information used everywhere appropriate 
(cid:216) Single expression of any piece of knowledge 

13


Explore Mycin’s Use of 
Knowledge 

** Did you use RULE 163  	 to find out anything about 
ORGANISM-1? 
RULE163 was tried in the context of ORGANISM-1, but it 
failed because it is not true that the patient has had a 
genito-urinary tract manipulative procedure (clause 3). 
** Why didn't you consider streptococcus as a 
possibility? 
The following rule could have been used to determine that 
the identity of ORGANISM-1 was streptococcus: 
RULE033 
But clause 2 (“the morphology of the organism is coccus”) 
was already known to  be false for ORGANISM-1, so the 
rule was never tried.

z From initial complaints, guess suitable hypothesis.
z Use current active hypotheses to guide questioning
z Failure to satisfy expectations is the strongest clue 
to a better hypothesis; differential diagnosis
z Hypotheses are activated, de-activated, confirmed or 
rejected based on 
(1) logical criteria 
(2) probabilities based on:
findings local to hypothesis
causal relations to other hypotheses

State of the Art (1989)

(cid:216) Small, self-contained systems should be easy, but there 
are not very many being built.
(cid:216) • By contrast, Feigenbaum et al. point to 1,500 commercial 
systems in use in 1988, with thousands more in development
(cid:216) A few sophisticated, modern, probability-based systems 
are now being built
(cid:216) HIS's really are being developed (slowly, but surely) and 
will provide a critical opportunity for experimentation
(cid:216) No large, broad-domain, deep systems are being 
tackled today

so in the future
