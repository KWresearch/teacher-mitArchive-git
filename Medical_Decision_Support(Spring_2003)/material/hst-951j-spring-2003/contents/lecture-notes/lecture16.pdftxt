Using these


• and evaluate 
performance on 
new cases 

• and determine 
which variables are 
important 

Survival function 

Probability that an individual survives at least t 

•  S(t) = P(T > t) 
•  By definition, S(0) = 1 and S(∞)=0 
•  Estimated by (# survivors at t / total patients) 
100

Unconditional failure rate


•  Probability density function (of death) 
•  f(t) = lim Δt-> 0  P(individual dies (t,t+Δt))/ Δt 
•  f(t) always non-negative 
•  Area below density is 1 
•  Estimated by 

# patients dying in the interval/(total patients*interval_width)

Same as # patients dying per unit interval/total


Some other definitions 

•	 Just like S(t) is “cumulative” survival, F(t) is 
cumulative death probability 
•  S(t) = 1 – F(t) 
•  f(t) = - S’(t) 

Conditional failure rate 

•  AKA Hazard function 
•  h(t) = lim Δt-> 0  P(individual aged t dies (t,t+Δt))/ Δt 
•  h(t) is instantaneous failure rate 
•  Estimated by 

# patients dying in the interval/(survivors at t *interval_width)

•  So can be estimated by 
# patients dying per unit interval/survivors at t 
h(t) = -S’(t)/S(t) = -d log S(t)/dt 
h(t) = f(t)/S(t) 

Parametric estimation 

Example: Exponential 
•  f(t) = λe-λt 
•  S(t) = e-λt 
•  h(t) = λ

Weibull distribution 

•	 Generalization of the 
exponential 
•  For λ,γ > 0 
•  f(t) = γλ(λt)γ-1  e-λt γ 
•  S(t) = e-λt γ 
•  h(t) = γλ(λt) γ-1

Non-Parametric estimation 
Product-Limit (Kaplan-Meier) 

S(t) 

1 

S(ti) = Π (nj - dj )/ nj 

dj  is the number of deaths in interval j 
nj  is the number of individuals at risk 
Product is from time interval 1 to j 
One interval per death time

Kaplan-Meier


•  Example 
•	 Deaths: 10, 37, 40, 80, 91,143, 164, 188, 188, 190, 
192, 206, … 

Life-Tables 
•  AKA actuarial method 

S(ti) = Π  (nj - dj )/ nj

dj  is the number of deaths in interval j

nj  is the number of individuals at risk

Product is from time interval 1 to j

Pre-defined intervals j are independent of death times

Simple  models


Multiple strata


Multivariate models


•	 Several strata, each defined by a set of 
variable values 
•	 Could potentially go as far as “one 
stratum per case”? 
•  Can it do prediction for individuals? 

Cox Proportional Hazards 

•  Regression model 
•	 Can give estimate of hazard for a 
particular individual relative to baseline 
hazard at a particular point in time 
•	 Baseline hazard can be estimated by, 
for example, by using survival from the 
Kaplan-Meier method 

Proportional Hazards


λi = λ e−βxi 
where λ  is baseline hazard and xi  is covariate for patient 

Cox proportional hazards 
hi(t) = h0(t) e βxi 

•	 Survival 

Si(t) = [S0(t)]eβxi 

Cox Proportional Hazards


hi(t) = h0(t) e βxi 
•  New likelihood function is how we extimate β 
•	 From the set of individuals at risk at time j (Rj), the probability of 
picking exactly the one who died is 

h0(t) e βxi 
Σm  h0(t) e βxm 
•  Then likelihood function to maximize to all j  is 
•  L(β) = Π (e βxi  / Σm e βxm ) 

Important details


•	 Survival curves can’t cross  if hazards are 
proportional 
•	 There is a common baseline h0, but we don’t need to 
know it to estimate the coefficients 
•  We don’t need to know the shape of hazard function 
•	 Cox model is commonly used to interpret importance 
of covariates (amenable to variable selection 
methods) 
•  It is the most popular multivariate model for survival 
•	 Testing the proportionality assumption is difficult and 
hardly ever done 

Estimating survival for a 

patient using the Cox model

•  Need to estimate the baseline 
•	 Can use parametric or non-parametric model 
to estimate the baseline 
•	 Can then create a continuous “survival curve 
estimate” for a patient 
•  Baseline survival can be, for example: 
–  the survival for a case in which all covariates are 
set to their means 
–  Kaplan-Meier estimate for all cases 

What if the proportionality 

assumption is not OK?

•  Survival curves may 
cross 
•	 Other multivariate 
models can be built 
•  Survival at certain time 
points are modeled and

Summary


•	 Kaplan-Meier for simple descriptive 
analysis 
•	 Cox Proportional for multivariate prediction 
if survival curves don’t cross 
•	 Other methods for multivariate survival 
exist: logistic regression, neural nets, 
CART, etc.
