•	 discretizes  the  data  according  to  the  fuzzy  discretization  scheme  outlined 
in  the  lecture  creating  another  data  frame,  and 
•  writes  the  discretized  data  to  a  ﬁle  in  Rosetta  import  format. 

2.1.1  Hints 

ramp(x, v , w) = 

Following the  ideas outlined  in the  lecture, we consider genes to be regulated up 
(u), neutral (n), or down (d).  Let G = {gj }j  be a set of gene symbols, and  let U 
be  a  set  of  tissue  samples.  Abusing  notation  slightly,  let  g(x)  denote  the  value 
of  expression  of  the  gene  g  in  tissue  sample  x.  For  each  gene  g  in  question,  we 
for now assume  the existence of  three corrsponding  fuzzy membership  functions 
   
gu , gn , gd  :  U  → [0, 1].  Let  ramp  :  R3  → [0, 1]  be  deﬁned  as 
if  x ≤ v 
0 
1 
if  x > w 
x−v 
otherwise 
w−v 
Associate with  each  gene  g  a  triplet  (gmin , gmedian , gmax ) ∈ R3  such  that  gmin  ≤ 
gmedian  ≤ gmax .  Using  these  we  deﬁne 
gu (x)  =  ramp(g(x), gmedian , gmax ) 
gd (x) = 1 − ramp(g(x), gmin , gmedian ) 
gn (x) = 1 − max(gu (x)), gd (x)). 
The deﬁnition  of  the membership  function  for  a  gene  expression  attribute  value 
set  is  then  parametrisized  via  the  values  (gmin , gmedian , gmax ).  These  we  deter-
mine  by  letting  gmin  = min{g(x)|x ∈ U � },  gmedian  = median{g(x)|x ∈ U � },  and 
gmax  = max{g(x)|x ∈ U � }.  Given  a  tissue  x ∈ U � ,  we  determine  its  discretized 
value  for  gene  g  as  arg maxl∈{u,n,d} (gl (x)),  encoding  elements  of  u, n, d  as  the 
integers  2, 1, 0,  respectively.  Assume  that  you  can  break  ties  arbitrarily. 
The  Rosetta  import  format  is 

<attribute  name>  <attribute  name>  ...  <attribute  name> 
<attribute  type>  <attribute  type> 
<attribute  type> 
<value>  <value>  ...  <value> 

where 

<attribute  name>  is  either  a  string  containing  no  whitespace,  or  a  (double) 
quoted  string.  Neither  can  contain  (double)  quotes  (”). 

<attribute  type>  is  either  String,  Integer  (which  I  would  guess  that  you 
will use), or Float(n), where n is a decimal number describing the number 
of  decimals  after  the  integer  part.

<value>  is  a  value  of  a  type  given  above. 

Each  element  on  each  line  is  separated  by  whitespace  (space  or  tab). 

2.1.2  Deliverables 

The  ﬁle(s)  containing  the  R  program. 

2.2  Task  2 

The  task  is  to 

•	 Import  the  discretized  data  set  produced  in  Task  1  into  the  Rosetta 
system, 
•	 compute “reducts”  (reduce) using a  standard greedy algorithm  for  the  set 
cover  problem  attributed  to  D.S.  Johnson  (use  the  non-RSES  one), 
•  generate  rules,  and 
•  export  them  to  a  ﬁle  in  rosetta  export  format. 
•  Comment  brieﬂy  on  the  rules. 

2.2.1  Hints 

The  Rosetta  system  GUI  (which  only  runs  under  Windows,  while  the  kernel 
and command  line system runs on several platforms) has two main components, 
structures  and  algorithms.  The  latter  can  be  applied  to  the  former  to  produce 
the  latter.  Both  can  be  found  in  the  pro ject  tree  view  that  the  GUI  presents. 
Algorithms  can  also  be  found  by  right-clicking  on  a  structure.  The  selected 
algorithm  will  then  applied  to  the  structure,  and  the  result  will  usually  appear 
as  a  sub  structure  of  the  structure  it  was  computed  from.  For  this  task  the 
algorithm  types  to  apply  (after  importing  the  data  by  ﬁle->open)  are  of  the 
type  reducer  (ob ject  related and modulo decision),  rule generator,  and exporter 
(plain  format). 

2.2.2  Deliverables 
•  The  ﬁle  containing  the  exported  rules. 
•	 A  ﬁle  containing  your  comments  about  the  rules.  Comment  on  how  they 
reﬂect  the  relationship  between  gene  expression  and  tissue  type.
