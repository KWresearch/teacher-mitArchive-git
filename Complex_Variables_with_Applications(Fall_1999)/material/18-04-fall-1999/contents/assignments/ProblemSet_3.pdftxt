PROBLEM SET #3: 
PLEASE: Staple your answers! 
The suggested problems (from the book) are ones that you should look and 
make sure you know how to do them. These are not problems to be handed in.

OTHER PROBLEMS 
3.1) Consider the complex potential for a fluid given by w = A z^3, where 
A > 0: 
(i)   Find the potential "phi", the stream-function "psi" 
and the velocity field (u,v). 
(ii)  Sketch the streamlines and the velocity field in the complex 
plane. 
(iii) Can you use this to find an incompressible, irrotational flow in 
a wedge (for some angle)? 
What is the angle of the wedge you can do with this solution? 
Can you think of a way to get solutions for other angles?
