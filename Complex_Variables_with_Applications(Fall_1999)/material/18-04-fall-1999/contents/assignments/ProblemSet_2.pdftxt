18.04 PROBLEM SET #2: 
 
Due at recitation week Sept 27 -- Oct. 1.  PLEASE: Staple your answers! 
The suggested problems (from the book) are ones that you should look and 
make sure you know how to do them. These are not problems to be handed in.

OTHER PROBLEMS 
2.1) Consider the (multiple valued!) mapping in the complex plane 
 
z ----> z^(1/3) 
 
(that is, the cubic root, with three values for each z). 
What are the images, under this map, of 
a) The half plane Re(z) > 0? 
b) The quadrant Re(z) < 0, Im(z) < 0? 
c) The wedge -pi/4 < Arg(z) < pi/4? 
In each case, draw the initial set and the image set and explain your 
answer (i.e. why is this so?), don't just state it. 
 
2.2) Consider the sequence generated by Newton's method, when computing the 
square root of 1. Starting from some arbitrary complex number z_0, the 
sequence is given by: 
z_{n+1} = 0.5*(z_n + 1/z_n). 
 
Show that if Re(z_0) > 0, then Re(z_n) > 0 for ALL n. 
 
2.3) In problem (2.2), assume that z_0 is purely imaginary.  Then ALL z_n's 
are imaginary and the sequence becomes: 
 
z_n = i*y_n,   where   y_{n+1} = 0.5*(y_n - 1/y_n) 
 
and the y_n's are all real numbers. 
 
Now write: y_n = cot(theta_n). 

Show then that the sequence becomes theta_{n+1} = 2*theta_n. 
 
Note: the transformation from y_n to theta_n is multiple valued; for 
each y_n there is a whole set of theta_n's   (the cotangent is 
periodic, with period 2*pi). So the statement above means that 
if you take any of the possible values theta_n can have,  then 
twice that value is a possible value for theta_{n+1}. 
 
Now think of what happens if you take an arbitrary point on the unit 
circle and you move it by duplicating its argument each time. What does 
this tell you about what the iterates by Newton's method do on the 
imaginary axis?
