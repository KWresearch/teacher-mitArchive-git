Students in 12.000 are required to present their final design in two ways. They
must first create a content-rich web site that not only describes their design
in great detail, but also justifies their design choices. Second, they must
make a two-hour oral presentation of their design to a panel of experts on the
subject, drawn from outside the MIT community, who can provide immediate
feedback. This final presentation will be webcast live during the last week of
classes. The Web site must be complete and âon-lineâ one week prior to the
presentation.
***** Student Responsibilities *****
Each student is required to be an active member of his or her team and to
participate in class discussions (e.g., the Perspectives Sessions). In
addition, each student must create a personal Web site that details his or her
week-to-week accomplishments in 12.000.
***** Team Responsibilities *****
Each team is expected to develop sufficient expertise to contribute its
assigned component to the overall design. The students in the team collectively
develop a team Web site that provides detail regarding their group efforts and
design accomplishments.
