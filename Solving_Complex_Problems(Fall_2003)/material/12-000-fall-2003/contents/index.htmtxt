***** Course Description *****
Solving Complex Problems provides an opportunity for entering freshmen to gain
first-hand experience with working as part of a team to develop effective
approaches to complex problems in Earth system science and engineering that do
not have straightforward solutions. The subject includes training in a variety
of skills, ranging from library research to Web_Design.
Each year's course explores a different problem in detail through the study of
complimentary case histories and the development ofÂ creative_solution
strategies. Beginning in 2000 as an educational experiment sponsored by MIT's
Committee on the Undergraduate Program, and receiving major financial support
from theÂ Alex_and_Britt_d'Arbeloff_Fund_for_Excellence_in_MIT_Education, the
subject is designed to enhance the first-semester freshman experience by
helping students develop contexts for other subjects in the sciences and
humanities, and by helping them to establish learning communities that include
upperclassmen, faculty, MIT alumni, and professionals from many walks of life.
In Fall 2003, students from the Class of 2007 were challenged with âMission
2007â:
    * To design the most "environmentally correct" strategy for oil exploration
      and extraction in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR); and
    * To perform a cost-benefit analysis in order to evaluate whether or not
      the hydrocarbon resources that might be extracted from beneath ANWR are
      worth the environmental damage that might result from the process.
