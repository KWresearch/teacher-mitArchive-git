Assignment 6: Making a Community Place - Clues, Attitude and 
Program 

ARCHITECTURE DESIGN: LEVEL 1

"Community and Privacy - Building in Earthtexture"


For this first assignment you are asked to think about what this building wants to  

be. What is the program that would satisfy your needs and bring people together  

in the community? What kind of spaces for work would you need? How can we 

design buildings in our present society that can address the issue of community? 

What is the connection to nature? How can nature be introduced into the city? 


It would be a good time to revisit the site and understand more of the community. 

You might do this by being there at different times of the day, by talking with 

people who live there or by understanding the history of the area. From your 

observations ideas for the program and form should come. 


Next (to be discussed) the following should be done: 


1. Two 20 x 30 boards to include your attitude about the building, program uses 
and sizes (make areas of colored paper to show sizes) and sketches about how 
you might use the site. Include at 1/16‚Äù scale as many sketch plans as you can 
about a beginning approach to the design.
