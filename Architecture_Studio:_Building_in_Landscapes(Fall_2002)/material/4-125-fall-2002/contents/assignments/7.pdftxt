Assignment 7: First pass at Design 

ARCHITECTURE DESIGN: LEVEL 1

"Community and Privacy - Building in Earthtexture"


Having an attitude, program and sketch ideas about the project the next step is to 

start the design process. We will start by working in model form and then later 

work with drawings. However, sketches of your ideas in plan, section and 

perspective in your sketch book should always be part of the process. 


There are two parts to this assignment. The first is very abstract and at 1/16" 

scale build a quick context model of the area and with found objects make a 

quick design of your initial ideas about the general form of the building and ideas 

about the integration of nature. Use what objects you can find and think of the 

idea of the design. For the second part, work at 1/8" scale and translate the first 

idea (or better another idea) into form. The materials for this should be bass 

wood and cardboard and should start to hint at the nature of the building. It need  

not be strictly related to the program, but the overall concept of the building and 

nature should be clear. This should be quick, almost like playing with blocks. 


Include one 20 x 30 board of your sketches and ideas.

While doing both of these use the following as a guide to think about: 


1.  Nature in the city. 
2.  Nature and the Building. 
3.  Ground form, middle form and sky form. 
4.  Transitions from the inside/outside. 
5.  Ordinary and Extraordinary.
