Assignment 1: Clues and References 

ARCHITECTURE DESIGN: LEVEL 1

"Community and Privacy - Building in Earthtexture"


We will spend the afternoon at the quarry site. During this time you should think  

about the nature of the site: 


•  What does it feel like? 
•  Where did it come from 
•  How can someone else understand it? 
•  What would the ideal meeting place be like? 
•  Where should it be? 

By the end of the afternoon, you should have selected a location for your design 
project and photographed/sketched the area so you can bring back information to 
the studio. You also should bring back a "site clue" that you can talk about with 
the rest of the studio. Finally, you should start to think about the design. 
Due for next review: 

1. 	 One 20"x 30" drawing/board to show the site through photos, sketches, sit clues, 
and an attitude about your design. 

2.  Sketch model at 1/8" scale of the area and simple form model of your first idea.
