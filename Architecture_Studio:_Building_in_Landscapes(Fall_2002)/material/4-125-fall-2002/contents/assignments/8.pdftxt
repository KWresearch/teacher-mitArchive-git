Assignment 8: A Building Design 

ARCHITECTURE DESIGN: LEVEL 1

"Community and Privacy - Building in Earthtexture"


Now that you have a concept that has been representative in physical forms both  

abstract and the beginning of an architectural design the next step is to design 

the building in more detail. Now you should look at the program fit, circulation, 

structure (just the beginning) light, space making and form issues. Although this  

assignment is to produce a complete design we will continue to refine the design. 

The medium for doing this is both in model form and drawings. 


Work both in a sketch model and drawings at the same time using 1/8" scale. 

You may find it useful to sketch at the same time at other scales. For the next pin 

up the following should be done: 


1. 	 Sketch model showing "horizontals and verticals" made from bass wood, 
cardboard and other materials to convey the form and space of the building. 
Elevations are not important. 
2. 	 Plans of the ground floor showing the site and context, second floor and other 
floors. These plans should show uses, structure, circulation, textures. 
3. 	 At least two sections through the building and site. Always include the context on 
any section. 

Drawings should be on 20 x 30 boards.
