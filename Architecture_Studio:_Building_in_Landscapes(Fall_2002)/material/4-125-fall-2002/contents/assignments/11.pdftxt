Assignment 11: Putting it All Together 

Project Statement 

This is the last assignment and has several objectives; the first to develop the 
final design of the building and landscape; the second is to produce a set of 
presentation materials and the final to exhibit the journey through the semester. 

The old work for this includes: 

1.  Boards and models from first two projects. 
2.  Boards and all models of this project. 

For new work the following should be done: 

1. 	 Model at 1/8” scale to show your building and your second project. Context can 
be abstract of existing buildings. The model should be as detailed as possible and 
using abstract materials (wood, cardboard, metals, color board). On the model you 
should place your second project as well as new model of your final design. 
2. 	 Context drawing or aerial photo to show roofs of your buildings and context 
buildings in North End (scale to fit one 20 X30 board). 
3. 	 Plans of all floors at 1/8” scale show surface materials, walls, structure, and uses. 
Lettered of uses and color on back to illustrate the public parts of the building. 
4.  At least two sections at 1/8” scale rendered to show light. 
5. 	 Elevation of your building at 1/8” scale with adjacent buildings and rendered to 
show light. 
6.  	 Some form of three dimensional drawing: axo, exploded iso, perspective, 
sketches. 
7.  Section at 1/4" scale to show structure, façade, light. 
8.  Statement of your project and title board. 

Drawings should be done to fit 20 x30 boards although some drawings will need 
more than one board. Make drawings the same size as board (not smaller).
