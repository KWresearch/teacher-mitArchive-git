Assignment 6a: Making a Community Place 

ARCHITECTURE DESIGN: LEVEL 1 
"Community and Privacy - Building in Earthtexture" 

Program 

The program for this project is to design a place where you and your studio 
community, residents of North End and even tourists might meet and form a 
larger community. The intention is to design a joyful/livable place that all would 
want to be part of and provide places within the building for different size groups. 

The exact program and idea is up to you, however the following criteria should be 
included: 

1. 	 Not more than 6000 square feet with one larger space for meetings, gathering, 
some middle size spaces and a number of smaller spaces such as offices, work. 
2.  Some spaces should be vertical connecting uses on several floors. 
3.  Buildings should be around three stories high. 
4. 	 About 2/3 of the site should be left open for a natural area that might be integrated 
with the building. 
5.  Building should use one of the two blank walls (to be explained) to build against. 
6.  Issues of the ordinary and extraordinary should be considered. 
7.  An emphases on the public parts of the building should be designed.
