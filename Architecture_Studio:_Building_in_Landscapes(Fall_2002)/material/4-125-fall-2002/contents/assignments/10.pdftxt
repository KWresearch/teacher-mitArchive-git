Assignment 10: Detailing a Chunk 

Project Statement 


For this last assignment before the final review we are going to look a small 

chunk of your building at 1/4” scale. Select an area that has an elevation on the  

street and build a sketch model to explore structure, materials, space, light and  

the elevation. Think of actual materials you might use and what the building 

might look like. 


Take an area that is not large but represents your building. Include also the 

ground area around the building and think also of surface materials outside. Do 

not try to show actual materials but more materials that can represent the 

materials. 


Start the model as soon as possible and let the model tell you what to do not you 

tell the model. 

More in studio….
