We will require reading and writing short critiques of two or three papers per
week. One paper will be assigned in class for everyone to read. Each week we
will have a list of readings and you may choose one or two readings from the
list (or one of your own choosing that is relevant to the week's theme). You
should write a one-page review of the reading.
                                           Course readings.
