MAS 962: Computational Semantics 

Assignment 1 

Readings 

Quillian, M. (1968) Semantic Memory. In M. Minsky, ed, Semantic Information Processing, 
216-270. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA. 

Harnad, S. (1990) The Symbol Grounding Problem. Physica D 42: 335-346. 

Questions 

1. Summarize each paper’s main ideas (one page maximum for each summary) 

2. Consider a machine that represents word meanings in terms of a Quillian network. What 
sort of linguistic processing tasks would be inherently easy for such a machine? What tasks 
would be difficult? 

3. Are semantic networks compatible with Harnad’s notion of symbol grounding? If so, how? 
If not, why not?
