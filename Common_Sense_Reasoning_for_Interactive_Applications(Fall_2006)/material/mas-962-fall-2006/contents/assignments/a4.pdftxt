Questions 

1. For each paper, summarize the main ideas and your reactions to them. 

2. Where does Regier & Carlson’s model of spatial semantics fit into Gardenfor’s scheme? 

3. Consider the following syllogism: 

Cheap apartments are rare

Rare things are expensive  

---------------------------------------

Cheap apartments are expensive  


We can tighten the language and retain the result: 

Cheap apartments (in Boston that are desirable) are rare (things) 
Rare things (in Boston that are desirable) are expensive 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cheap apartments (in Boston that are desirable) are expensive 

Provide an explanation for why this syllogism fails to produce a ‘reasonable’ conclusion.
