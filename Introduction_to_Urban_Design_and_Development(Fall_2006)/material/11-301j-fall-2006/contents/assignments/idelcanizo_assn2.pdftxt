Lowell’s “JAM” Urban Renewal Plan 
 
General Background and Plan Overview1
Lowell, Ma is a classic in urban design. The success story of its famous 1972 plan to 
revitalize the historic downtown has been studied not only in 11.301 Introduction to 
Urban Design but also in other planning classes during this semester. 
 
This paper analyzes the Lowell, MA Jackson/Appleton/Middlesex (JAM) Urban Renewal 
Plan, a somewhat newer plan from year 2000 created by the Division of Planning and 
Development of the City Hall. 
 
The central objective of the plan is to recover a depressed industrial district of Lowell and 
to help revitalize it by means of injecting public funds needed to upgrade the 
infrastructure and physical form in order to attract private investment and development.

The plan focuses on a small portion of the district, heavily influenced by its industrial-
oriented old buildings, the opportunity to recover two canals once used to generate 
hydropower in the manufacturing process, and by the characteristic huge sized mills that 
dominates grand portion of the area. 
The decline of Lowell as a central manufacturing and industrial site is a deep-rooted 
problem dating decades old. For long, the City had entered in a series of plans to cope 
with the decrepit shape of its infrastructure and buildings, the stagnant economies of its 
businesses, and the high unemployment and crime rate.  
•  Area 
The plan focuses on a 50 acres site known as The Canals Industrial District located 
next to the downtown National Historical Park Disctrict. The area is divided from 
West to East by the two historical canals of Pawtucket and Hamilton built in 1825 to 
benefit from the 13 feet drop of the ancient Pawtucket Falls.

We have chosen a series of criteria to analyze the righteousness and achievements of the 
Plan.  The rest of the paper will review each of those criteria, describing how the Plan 
tackle such parameter, and analyzing the appropriateness and fitness of it.

Plan Defines and Solve Problems, states Objectives 
JAM Plan is an Urban Revitalization Plan that needs to become a full Economic 
Recovery Plan. The Plan “hopes to invigorate a part of the City currently underutilized 
but one with tremendous potential”. The minds behind the Division of Planning and 
Development (DPD) recognize the market failure to invest in the area and thus to benefit 
the City  with the full potential of the site. But in my opinion the DPD fails to address the 
issue of what is the underlying real cause of the decay, and what to do to stop or revert it. 
The urban decay is only the consequence of a deeper and more complex economical 
cause.  
 
Lowell is not an exception in the economic principle of relocation of manufacturing 
activities. Economic growth is not possible with the deployed production assets unless 
the City, not to mention the State or the whole Country, finds a way to compete in 
productivity and manufacturing costs. It is obvious that the source of employment and 
growth will have to come from other sources. The JAM Plan fails to analyze the roots of 
the problem and obviously doesn’t provide with a sound economic formula for success. 
Rebuilding urban form might not be sufficient to do the job. 
 
The planners together with the Citizens Advisory Committee came up with 17 different 
objectives for the JAM Plan that in my opinion could be better described in a condensed 
and grouped manner as follows: 
 
 
1. To expand the tax base and create new 
jobs by providing sites for commercial and 
industrial development. 
2. To attract new businesses to the area by 
creating accessible development sites. 
3. To provide incentives for existing 
businesses to grow. 
9. To enhance the marketability and promote 
the development of under-utilized land in 
the area by assembly, reparcelizing and 
subdivision of land. 
11. To provide sites of sufficient size and 
with appropriate access and improvements, 
so that new construction is encouraged and 
sound redevelopment is facilitated. 
4. To create new and efficient access 
alternatives to the area and enhance the 
transportation system, including pedestrian 
systems. 
5. To develop adequate parking for existing 
and proposed development. 
15.  To recognize and define major 
pedestrian access points to the Area and to

7. To preserve the historic integrity of the 
area. 
6. To create a safe, accessible, and 
aesthetically positive environment. 
8. To remove obsolete, substandard and 
deteriorated buildings and other 
environmental conditions which are factors 
in spreading blight and deterioration within 
the area and to adjacent areas. 
10. To improve public utilities by 
constructing or reconstructing sidewalks, 
street lighting, water, sewer and drainage 
systems and installing electrical and 
telephone lines underground where 
appropriate. 
12.  To increase public safety by providing 
improved pedestrian access and by reducing 
vehicular and pedestrian interaction 
throughout the project area. 
13.  To promote sound site planning and 
building arrangement in the development of 
individual parcels by private redevelopers in 
order to achieve coordinated and 
harmonious urban design. 
14. To provide for changes in land use to 
create a compatible mixture and clear pattern 
of mixed use commercial, residential, and 
industrial. 
16. To encourage the highest quality design 
for structures to be built, and for supporting 
elements such as lighting and planting. 
17.  To reflect in architecture and site 
planning the uniqueness of the area in terms 
of location, access, visibility and historic 
character. 
 
To respond to such a challenging list of objectives, the foresee outcome of the JAM Plan 
could be summarized in: 
a.  Invigorate underutilized part of Lowell 
i.  Creation of 533 new jobs  
ii.  Build +900 parking spaces 
b.  Increase Real Estate value to promote redevelopment: demolish useless 
structures and  upgrade infrastructure, specially accessibility to site (new 
streets, widen sections, pedestrian safety and new sidewalks). 
c.  Develop or rehab 300,000 sq ft of retail, office and industrial space.

The objectives of the Plan are heavily influenced by the precedent 1972 Land Use Plan 
for Lowell that created the National Historic Park around the downtown industrial mill 
complex. Thus, Lowell’s new bet is that the JAM Plan would do the revitalization trick 
once again in a more modest district scale. 
 
I believe that applying the same urban renewal model now might not work as well as 
before. Firstly, part of the success in the original Plan was its novelty and the creation 
from scratch of a “Thematic Mill City”, now the effect of adding extra 50 acres of mills 
will be marginal for the monothematic site. Secondly, all of Lowell’s brokers interviewed 
by this author agree that the city suffers from an overbuild stock of space, specially in the 
form of rehab footage. Absorbtion rates are decaying and the market might not be strong 
enough to absorb such a strong pipe line of new square footage. 
 

•  Group problems into +/- six items 
•  Effectiveness of the Plan: long term changes in the district 
•  How well did the plan anticipate and affect the future? 
Plan is Durable but still Adaptable 
As we have mentioned above, The JAM Plan is a revisit of a previous comprehensive 
Plan for the whole City of Lowell, the 1972 Land Use Plan. Years later such 
comprehensive plan was further re-evaluated in several occasions an finally in 1987 some 
actions for the site were formalized in the form of The Appleton/ Middlesex Plan. 
Unfortunately its implementation was never completed.  
 
I think that now the new 2000 plan does an excellent job in recognizing the potential of 
this site, located inmidiately adjacent to the downtown and its National Historical Park, 
and across the Gallahger Rail & Bus Terminal.

It is remarkable to highlight that 3 decades after the original Plan was crafted, its 
guidelines and vision are still in full conformance with the JAM Plan now presented. 
 
The only arena where the JAM Plan might fall short is in seizing the opportunity to 
provide for more open space and green areas. Most of the 18.2 acres te be acquired by the 
City will be used for rehab 
or redevelopment, on a 
context of demand 
uncertainty. The proposed 
4.36 acres clearance area is 
mainly dedicated to develop 

Luis del Canizo

better access and for parking facilities. Green areas are neglected. Currently there is no 
park land or open space in the area despite the fact that 21% of the total space is 
comprised by vacant lots. 
Since the economic feasibility of the site is less rigorous than desired, more flexibility in 
Zoning requirements could be beneficial. Furthermore, the success of the plan relies on 
the private sector following suit to the public sector intervention. But little has been 
provided in terms of adapting the plan to shifting market conditions. Such rigidity might 
be fatal for the long prospect of the Plan.  
Plan is Comprehensive 
The JAM Plan is comprised of most of the criteria parameters that where discussed in 
11.301 class. We must also tak into account that this Plan is the last one so far of a series 
of more comprehensive district, neighborhood, and City Plans that have been created 
through the years with a more comprehensive Master Plan in mind.  
 
The JAM Plan conveys an area of +50 acres, in The Canals Industrial District. The fact 
that the essence of the Plan is economic renewal and that it encompasses the acquisition 
by eminent domain of 18.26 acres of private property, has probably helped DPD to craft a 
rather sound and comprehensive Plan.  
 
The biggest missing item and in my opinion a striking failure is the inclusion of a sound 
assessment of market demand for all the space that will be created, and an analysis of 
how that increase in supply might affect real estate values across the city. The Plan 
propose to build 75,000 sq ft of retail, 100,000 sq ft of office space and other 1000,000 sq 
ft of industrial space. It is becoming increasingly risky to become a spec. developer.  
 
Finally, the plan doesn’t mention the problem of Gentrification. In my opinion the Plan 
will create the optimal conditions for gentrification: 
•  The site has 92% of the residents under lease contract. 
•  Median gross rents in JAM are almost a half of normal rent levels in Lowell, 
and therefore a major increase on rents could be expected as the Plan takes 
place . 
•  Median household income in the area is only 30% of the household income in 
Lowell, evidencing that the current residents are among the poorest of the 
City.  
•  More than 30% of the residents are between 20 and 29 years old, and 1/3 are 
inmigrants. 

 
Plan fits appropriately within the context 
The re-edition, now in a more focused and detailed form, of the original Land Use Plan of 
Lowell is in itself a quite impressive event that shows that time is of the essence when it 
comes to planning.  
 
The original plan’s visionary nature that created the National Historical Park back in the 
70’s has now a pivotal presence when it comes to analyze the contextual fit of the modern

JAM Plan. Lowell has become the reference for Historical Urban Preservation in the US, 
thanks to its industrial heritage icons: the Efficient City model built around mills, 
industrial canals, along the Merrimack river.  Lowell’s vision builds around the industrial 
theme by preserving its iconic mill buildings and by celebrating throughout its urban 
design its rich past. That powerful vision needs to be carry out in a monothematic way 
across all parts of the industrial town in order to maintain the thematic character of 
Lowell. 
 
However, the Plan recognizes the current needs of a place where accessibility and 
transportation are pivotal.  The JAM Plan also adapts the uses and even the urban form of 
buildings to make the existing massive structures fit modern requirements. New streets 
are opened on the site, and existing ones are widen to provide enhanced accessibility. A 
Public Parking Garage with +900 spaces will alleviate the parking constrain. The Plan 
vision is in my opinion to replicate again the Efficiency City model of Lowell and to link 
and incorporate the district to Lowell’s vibrant Historic downtown.  
 
Is it the right time for the JAM Plan? One can argue that the need to revitalize the site has 
long overdue for many decades. Bot other priorities has kept the City from implementing 
a model that has been so successful in the past. It is too early to say weather it has indeed 
been the right timing for the 50 acres redevelopment. In my opinion it will be the Market 
Demand for the newly created space the best parameter to measure the timeliness of the 
Plan. So far over a 1,000 newly rehab dwelling units are waiting downtown to be sold or 
rented. With that perspective in sight is daughtfull to assume that the private sector will 
invest in the short run. 
 
Plan Process is supported by constituencies 
The JAM Plan was created under the vision and leadership of the Division of Planning 
and Development DPD of Lowell.  The site was already targeted for renewal back in 
1072 and again in subsequent plans in 1986 and 1987’s “Appleton / Middlesex Plan”. 
The previous Plans where mainly focused on alleviating the lack of parking in the area as 
the means to propitiate the revitalization of the JAM site.  
 
The Plan claims in its page 93 “according to Mass Law the Plan fullowed a process of 
“extensive public participation”. A key component of the process was the active 
participation of a Citicens Advisory Committee. The 25 members CAC started meeting 
on a monthly basis on April 1999, that is one year prior Council approval of the final 
Plan. CAC was comprised by business and property owners, residents, non for profits, 
and other community leaders. The City also held two public meetings, a televised City 
Council, special meetings with Business owners, and the Lowell Planning Board. Also 
the City conducted a charrette on brownfield development specially geared towards the 
abandon mills. 
 
For the implementation DPD hired dedicated staff (4 people) located on a storefront 
implementation Office. The Plan states that such staff “on-site personnel should be able

to supply property owners and potential developers with” all the needed help. 
Interestingly enough, residents are not cited in the text as beneficiaries of the City help.  
 
City of Lowell and its DPD.- It comes to no surprise the strong leading role of the City, 
and its full commitment to finally tackle the redevelopment of the Canals Industrial 
District. The Plan states that the City will take “aggressive actions” as needed to make the 
Plan work. 
 
Business Owners.- Business owners have been proactively involved in the process, by 
means of surveys and interviews with DPD. The plan addresses their concerns and offers 
relief compensation for their relocation.  
 
Property Owners.- Extremely atomized in small parcels, except for a single big industrial 
owner that holds 44% of all properties on the site. The City contents that the owner “has 
no interest” which is hard to believe taking into account the large acreage held by the 
Trust. In my opinion the City got finally tired of negotiating with the owner, who was 
probably asking either for a big price to sell the property or for high subsidies to lessen 
the risk of investing capital in redevelop the site at current market condition. Some 20% 
of the land is vacant, and the majority of the land owners are absent of the management 
of their properties and the JAM planning process. 
 
Developers.- No significant building activity in the Canals Industrial District had taken 
place for decades. All attention was diverted until now to the downtown Historical 
District. 
 
Residents.-  In my opinion the residents where not very active or participative during the 
planning process, as it can be inferred from the Plan itself, the minutes appendix of CAC 
meetings, and the lack of solutions or proposals that the Plan dedicates to the current 
residents of the place. Of all the stakeholders, the group who has more to loose are the 
Residents. In a first glance one might think that the JAM Plan will transform the district 
into a better place, providing with a much needed influx of capital to upgrade the 
infrastructures and to invigorate the activity in the area. But a careful review of the 
demographics suggests that Gentrification will soon start taken its tall into the population 
forcing them to move to other places. As discussed previously, the demographics are set 
up for a classic example of gentrification, this time promoted by the JAM Plan: 
•  The site has 92% of the residents under lease contract. 
•  Median gross rents in JAM are almost a half of normal rent levels in Lowell, and 
therefore a major increase on rents could be expected as the Plan takes place . 
•  Median household income in the area is only 30% of the household income in 
Lowell, evidencing that the current residents are among the poorest of the City.  
•  More than 30% of the residents are between 20 and 29 years old, and 1/3 are 
inmigrants.

Plan is economically viable  
All the solid framework and bold structure of JAM Plan appears to banish when it 
reaches the point of evaluating its economic feasibility, or cuantifying its expected 
impact in the City.  
 
The over 100 pages JAM Plan results very brief in its economic assessment,

In my opinion the Plan’s grand fiasco is that fails to successfully demonstrate the 
economic virtues of its sound revitalization program. And it does so in an almost 
unprofessional way, by plainly neglecting to discuss in detail the full costs and benefits of 
the interventions, and who is to benefit and who is to loose. 
 
Although the plan is based in an extensive survey done on site, all the speculative 
development programmed lacks the backing of a rigorous Market Research. If a private 
developer was to risk its own money into such a big development, a major market 
research would be conducted to assess the demand for the proposed new development.  
Without an appropriate market assessment of the demand for new space, the evaluation of 
prices, or an idea of absorption rates, would be impossible to grasp an idea of the 
economics of the Plan and the risk of failure that it might entitle.  
 
Furthermore, the Plan claims 
shamelessly in its page 67 that it will 
generate some 533 new jobs, just by 
virtue of building an speculative stock 
of new space that could potentially 
host all those “new jobs”. The World 
is full of speculative empty buildings, 
and maybe that is the reason why no private developer has put its money to risk to date. 
 
The fair question to raise is weather the public investment in access and infrastructure 
will be enough of an incentive to shift the current market perception of the site, and thus 
act as a catalyst for further private investment.  The use of econometrics or parametric 
analysis of similar cases could help in providing a plausible answer. 
 
So, is this a Successful Plan? 
 
As mentioned during the argumentation of the paper, it might be a little early to claim the 
success or failure of the Plan. But our analysis can provide guidance on whether the Plan 
has the right combination of perspectives and content to succeed in its objectives. In my 
opinion JAM Plan ultimately presents a very complete and thorough vision of the Canals 
Industrial District, in perfect resonance with the city-wide Master Plan. The planning 
process was satisfactory and inclusionary with most stakeholders, with the important 
exemption of the residents.  
 
Indeed there are two critics that I can make to the Plan. First, the neglecting and 
exclusion of Residents on both the planning process and the long-term side effect of 
gentrification.  
 
Secondly, the lack of sound financial analysis to successfully proof the economic benefits 
of the plan and the monetary measurement of such success. I think such an extensive 
economic analysis is a moral prerequisite especially when the pillar of the Plan is to

acquire over 18.18 acres of private property using Eminent Domain for a yet vague and 
elusive objective of economic growth. 
 
Overall, this is a very good plan that was intended to be implemented three decades ago. 
Certainly, the time for Urban Renewal of Jackson/Appleton/Middlesex district has 
arrived.
