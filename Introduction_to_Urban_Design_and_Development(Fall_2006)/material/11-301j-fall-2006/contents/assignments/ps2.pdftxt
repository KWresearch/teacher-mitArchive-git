Assignment 2 
URBAN PLANS 

The purpose of this exercise is to explore the nature of plans and their impact on the form and function 
of  cities.    We  are  interested  in  the  motivations  for  creating  plans,  the  processes  by  which  they  are 
prepared, the models of urban design which underlay them, and the long term effects of plans -- or lack 
thereof  --  on  the  city.  Having  considered  these  issues,  we  would  like  to  answer  the  question:  What 
makes a good Plan?

Choose  a  plan  for  an  area  in  a  city  that  interests  you.   The  plan may  be  for  the  area  of Boston 
that you studied in Assignment 1 or for a district in any other city.  The plan you focus on may 
be  relatively  recent  or  may  have  been  created  several  decades  ago.    It  should  have  been 
developed  long  enough  ago  so  that  the  results  can  be  observed,  however.    Choose  a  plan  that 
proposes  changes  in  physical  form  as well  as  changes  in  activities  or  policies  to  be  applied  in 
the  area.  Finally,  choose  a  plan  for which  you  can  speak  with  one  or more  of  the  actors  who 
created it, or about which enough has been written so that it is possible to draw conclusions. 

Describe  the nature of  the plan and  the  reasons why  it was prepared.   What problems or  issues 
was the plan intended to address?  Who were the constituents for the plan? 

Discuss the process used to develop the plan.  Under whose authority was the plan prepared and 
carried out?  Were the constituents involved and to what degree was their involvement reflected 
in the plan? 

What model(s) of  design  and development underlay  the plan?   This may be one of  the models 
will discuss in class or another precedent that you feel had a strong influence on the plan.  Was 
the model appropriate to the problem? 

Was  the  plan  effective?    In making  this  assessment,  look  for  long  term  changes  in  the  district 
that  were  motivated  by  the  plan.    These  may  be  changes  in  form,  activities  or  social 
composition, but they may also be more subtle changes in attitudes or perceptions about a place 
which have long term impacts.  How well did the  plan anticipate and affect the future? 

Finally,  answer  the  question:  "Is  this  a  good  plan?"   Discuss  your  criteria  for  making  this 
judgment. 

Your  paper  should  not  exceed 12-15 pages,  including  text and any graphics you may wish  to  include.   
This assignment  is due  in class during Session 30.
