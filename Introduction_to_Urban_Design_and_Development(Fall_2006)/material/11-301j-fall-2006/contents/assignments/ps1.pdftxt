URBAN DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT 
 
 
Assignment 1, Fall 2006 
 
Urban Change 
 
Cities evolve incrementally as the result of many individual public and private actions.  These 
actions are shaped by macro forces, and each piece of the environment when built becomes an 
important determinant of the next.  Over time, some forces, such as climate, come to exert a 
pervasive and continuing influence on the city's form.  Other forces, such as fires or public "slum 
clearance programs" are short lived but result in drastic changes at specific locations.  Some 
forces, like transportation, are essential to urban life.  Others, such as the drive to express a civic 
vision in monuments and public spaces, are more capricious but nonetheless can have powerful 
consequences.   
 
This assignment addresses the underlying urban dynamics that are causing a city to change.  It 
also seeks to develop or sharpen your skills of observation, encouraging you to make inferences 
from the evidence of the physical environment and to test these through research.  
 
Directions   
 
1.   Choose a place within the Boston Metropolitan Area which has undergone significant 
physical change through its history, particularly over the past 10-20 years.  The area 
should be larger than a single building or site, and should involve multiple ownership (an 
institution is not appropriate).  A block of the inner city would be appropriate, or a section 
of the waterfront, or a two to five acre suburban site.  The changes it has undergone might 
be positive or negative, but must be observable.  And choose an area that interests you a 
great deal, since the job of digging up information on it may take considerable effort.  

Document the evolution of your area through time.  Develop a set of "snapshots" of the 
area at key points in time during which significant changes occurred -- not necessarily 
intervals of equal duration.  Documentation should include both illustrations (maps, 
sketches, photos, or other media) of the physical environment showing patterns of 
development, architectural typologies, etc., as well as descriptions and data about the 
changing nature of the area and its role in the city.   

Discuss the key forces which resulted in physical and functional change.  These forces 
may include, for example, changes in the economic function of the place, social structure, 
introduction of new public infrastructure, changes in the rules of development, or 
application of a particular vision of the city in your area of study.  Try to describe the 
motivation behind these forces and the particular effects in your area.

Predict the future of your area.  Evaluate the forces for change which are now active.  
Consider if these are a consequence of the historical chain of events which have effected 
this place over many years, or whether a whole new set of forces and interactions are now 
in play.  Interviews of residents, business owners, and others with a stake in the area 
would be a good way of supplementing written data.  Observations of building 
conditions, recent construction or other signs of change would also be helpful.  Based 
upon your analysis, try to predict what changes will be likely to occur at this location 
over the next 10-20 years.  

 
Product 
 
Document you findings in a brief paper, no more than 15-20 pages in length, including any 
data and illustrations you may wish to include.  Be sure to include a one-page summary of your 
conclusions up front.   The assignment should be done individually. 
 
To help you get started, we have assembled a preliminary bibliography that identifies sources on 
the development of Boston organized by various forces which have affected the city over time.  
You should also obtain a copy of Whitehill's Topographical History of Boston as a general 
reference for the assignment.  Nancy Seasholes’s Gaining Ground is another good source.  
Robert Campbell's Cityscapes of Boston: An American City Through Time, and Lois Craig’s 
Images of Boston, may be helpful in identifying potential areas for study. 
 
Please be prepared to identify the place that you are studying during Session 6. The assignment 
is due in class during Session 16.   We will discuss the exercise in class when you may be asked 
to make a brief presentation of your findings.  
 
 
 
Notes: You may choose a place in another city, however you must have ready access to 
sufficient information.  If you would like to work another city, please see the 
instructors.
