Part 1: Forces Affecting Urban Development
                     How are cities understood? City themes and city culture. Representations of
2      Viewpoints on cities as examples of viewpoints. The idea of imaging a city from the

                     changing the viewpoint on a city.
       The Forces    How does a city grow? The city viewed in time as a process of cultural
3      that Made     evolution. The recursive nature of form. How underlying forces are given
       Boston        form through design. Boston as an example of forces acting on the city and
                     models of design applied to resolve them.

                     places. Functional patterns of market and form: concentric zones, sectors,
                     nodes. Evolution of the patterns â from the walkable city to edge city.

                     Balancing the public viewpoint and private rights. Regulation of private
       The Public    development: zoning and incentives to influence what the market would
9      Wish          otherwise provide. Evolution of land use control efforts to shape the "good"
                     city and protect scarce resources. Zoning and the form of New York City,
                     from Hugh Ferris to Rudolph Giuliani.
