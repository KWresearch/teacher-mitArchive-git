What we know about how students learn:  

FAQs  


 
1.  What can instructors do to insure that students prepare before class? 
The assumption that student will have Idone the reading" is a given in humanities and social 
science courses.  Unfortunately the prevailing culture in many science and engineering 
departments is that students aren't expected to do the reading until after they have been 
introduced to the concept in class.  There are a variety of strategies that you can use to 
Iencourage" students to prepare for class: 
 

b. 	 

a. 	  Utilize pre-class assignments.  You can post or distribute questions that students 
need to answer before class. In small(er) classes you can use them as a basis for 
discussion.  In larger classes, you can ask students to hand them in. It is fairly 
straightforward to tell if a student has engaged with the pre-class questions - based 
on their participation in class, and the level of his/her responses to your questions.  
You probably will want to assign a Ipoint value" to these assignments - so that 
students know you value them.  Many instructors Ilump" the pre-class assignments 
and the p-sets together in terms of contribution to the course grade. 
If you are utilizing a website - you can post the questions, and ask student to post 
their responses before the next class session.  You may want to encourage student 
to read the comments of their peers - by asking them to post at least one question 
re: another student's posting.  You can review student postings before class - and 
use their responses as a starting off point for discussion.   
c. 	  Use a Ireading memo".  For a description of the philosophy behind reading memos, 
see:  http://web.mit.edu/S.9S/handouts/reading-memos.pdf (written by Sanjoy 
Mahajan from TLL). 
d. 	  Additional strategies can be found at:

Utilizing these strategies will also give you good sense of the level of understanding (and 
interest) of students, and can provide valuable info re: student misconceptions. 
 
2.  Can we get an overview of all the theories on how people learn? 
The following link provides a list of most of the prominent learning theories, with examples 
for each: http://tip.psychology.org/theories.html

put cognitive theories into practice)? 
As mentioned in  during the session: 
 
To help students  develop framework & context 

•	   Understand what students already know (and what their misconceptions are) and 
help them add new knowledge to existing framework. 
o	   Pre-tests 
o	   MUD cards  
o	   Pre-class, post-reading assignments (see the response to Q1  above) 
•	   Support  Imeaning making"/knowledge construction 
o	   Cue students:  give students the opportunity to formulate a response and 
help them at specific  points when they get  stuck, i.e. guide them through 
their answers.  
o	   Vary the conditions under which learning takes place.
 This could be as 
Itraditional"  as presenting the same  concept in  lecture and in  lab.  Students 
are generally  introduced to a concept in  lecture, but then  the concept is  
reinforced when students have to apply it  during the lab.   In an Iequation 
heavy class" ask students to formulate an answer without using equations.  
E.g. IConstruct a physical/verbal  argument for why the Entropy Maximum 
and Energy Minimum Principles are equivalent." (You could also ask students 
to construct a mathematical argument for the same statement.)  
o	   Require student to vote/publicly  commit to a answer before providing the 
solution.  This will increase students interesting and motivation to understand 
the solution.  

 
•	   Provide opportunities for practice (practice retrieval)  
o	   Set up situations wherein students have  to explain to other students  (Pose 
questions during class, and have students formulate answers in  pairs, or 
groups) 
o	   Pose Iopen-ended" problems, wherein students must determine what 
additional info they need to solve the problem (a la the broken hammer 
example from the session).  
o	   Pose questions  - targeted at specific, building (and testing)  a student's 
understanding of particular concepts and ideas 
o	   Give students the chance to apply what the have learned to new situations.  
Ask them to identify examples of a particular concept. (see the comment on 
the  synergy of  lab  and  classroom experiences

4.  I'd like more information on learning styles.  
Learning styles is  a somewhat controversial  topic. It is almost always a gross simplification,  
and a disservice to the learner  to take any individual  and identify him/her with a single 
learning style  (at the potential exclusion of all others).   Recent articles in Psychological 
Science in  the Public  Interest (ILearning Styles: Concepts and Evidence") and the Chronicle 
of Higher Education (IMatching Teaching Style to Learning Style May Not Help  Students") 
provides argue that  there is  no strong scientific  evidence to support the idea that teaching 
styles should  Imatch" learning styles".  Pdfs of these articles  are included Materials -> Class 2  
 
For completeness, however, information  on  learning  styles is provided in the  following links:

5.  How do  I motivate students to be interested in the class/course?  
The following web links provide some useful information and tips on motivating students in 

your class:

6.  How do we gather information on every students"  prior knowledge and apply it  to the rest 
of the semester so no one is  Ileft behind"?  
(This response was written by Dr.  Lori  Breslow - TLL's Director)  
 
This is  really  two questions.  
First, let me give you several  suggestions for determining students"  prior knowledge. 
Instructors in  science and engineering often use a pre-test, which does not count in  the 
student's  grade, to determine how much their students already know. In courses that rely on 
essays or other written work, instructors may ask students to write something that, again, 
does not figure in  their grade. In my course, we ask students to write a Ibaseline" self-
assessment memo in which they reflect on  their own  abilities in writing, speaking, and  
interpersonal  communication, as well  as identify what they want to improve upon during the

The second question�how to teach a class with a wide disparity of skills or knowledge�is, 
in  my opinion, the hardest question to answer for instructors who teach technical  subjects. 
My best advice is  the instructor should teach to the middle: that is, to the student with an 
average background who understands most of the material  with an average level  of effort. 
However, the instructor should also try to find ways to engage students who are better 
prepared or more knowledgeable, and provide additional  help for weaker students. Some 
instructors give the better prepared students extra hard problems or additional  research 
projects. (MIT students are often happy to do these�) Less prepared students  can be helped 
during office hours or extra tutorials. Most universities also have services (e.g., writing 
centers) that can help students with weaker skills.
