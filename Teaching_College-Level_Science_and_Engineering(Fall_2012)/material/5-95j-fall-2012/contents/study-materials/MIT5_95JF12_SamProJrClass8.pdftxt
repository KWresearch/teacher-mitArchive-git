Diffusion 
1. A sheet of steel 1.5 mm thick has N2 atmospheres on both sides at 1200 °C and is 
permitted to achieve a steady-state diffusion condition.  The DN2 at 1200 °C is 6(1011) 
m2/s and the diffusion flux is found to be 1.2(10-7) kg/m2-s.  In addition, it is known that 
3
C
N2 in the steel at the high-pressure surface is 4 kg/m .   
 
How far into the sheet from this high-pressure side will the concentration be 2.0 kg/m3?  
Assume a linear concentration profile.

1 You'll notice that most STEM problems that involve calculations are at the 3.1 - execute - level.  
Obviously, some problems are more nuanced than others and even though a strict "plug and chug" 
problem is technically still at 3.1, it's procedurally easier than a calculation that requires estimations, or 
other decisions about values, etc.

3.  Boron nitride wafers are used in conjunction with silicon wafers in a deposition step. 
Q = 2.25 (1013) boron atoms/cm2 are deposited on the surface of a silicon slice.  The slice 
is subsequently placed in a diffusion furnace at 1145 °C for 2 hours.  The n-type epi-layer 
into which the boron diffuses has an impurity concentration ND equal to 1(1016) 
atoms/cm3.  Assuming that the diffusion is Gaussian, find the depth of the p-n junction 
in mm. 
The junction occurs where the background concentration = the boron concentration.
