Open-ended, small group 
Brainstorm (5-20 minutes) 

You have been called by the 
manufacturer of this 
 
hammer to determine: 
 
1)  why their hammers 
 
keep breaking like this; 
 
2)  what they can do to 
 
prevent this.

• Vacancy diffusion 
Students are the atoms on a 2-d 
 
 
lattice.  Apply “jump” rules. 

 
• Tensile test 
Students are the atoms in a 
 
test specimen.

“Pair”-Share:  
Active Learning Strategies for your class 

With a 1 or 2 others from similar disciplines: 
  
 
�	  Consider the Learning Outcomes that you 
developed for your course (syllabus assignment). 
 
 
�	  Consider the various time-scales for active learning 
methods. 
   
 
�	  Develop active learning activities that will help 
students meet learning outcomes. 
 
 
�	  Consider problems/obstacles in implementation. 
 
 
�	  Be prepared to report to the larger group.
