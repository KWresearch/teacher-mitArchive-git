5.95J - Fall 2012 
Post(cid:3)- Class Assignment #4 
Course Design, Planning and Syllabus Construction 
 
Use the ideas discussed in the readings and in class, in particular:  big ideas, backward design, learning 
outcomes, and strategic teaching to construct a syllabus for a course that you may teach in the future.    
 
Make sure to include the following: 
 

• Course overview. Write a paragraph that provides an introduction to the course 
and the subject matter. The "course overview" should also discuss the format 
and approach the course will take (lecture? discussions? in-class exercises?) and 
the value of the course to the students  
• Course objectives. Remember Davis writes about both "content" and "noncontent" 
goals. You should include both.  
• Course content. List the topics to be covered in the order they are to be discussed. 
Be sure to make clear the conceptual structure used to organize the course.  
• Course assignments. List the papers, exams, projects, etc. students will be 
expected to complete for the course. Think about how these assignments 
reinforce the objectives of the course. Sketch out when these assignments will 
be due to make sure they are distributed evenly throughout the course.  
• Course policies. State your policies regarding, for example: class attendance; late 
work; missed homework, tests, or papers; class participation; classroom 
behavior. Why have you decided on these policies?
