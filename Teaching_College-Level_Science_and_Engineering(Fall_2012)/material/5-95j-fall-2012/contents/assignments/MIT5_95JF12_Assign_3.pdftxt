Developing Your Teaching Philosophy  
 


Based on your preliminary work during ICA 3, draft your own teaching philosophy statement. 

This statement should reflect your own thoughts about the importance and values of teaching 

and of education. It may contain some or all of the following:  

 


•	   A description of the ways in which you make decisions about course content 
and teaching methodologies.  (How you teach) 
•	   Your ideas about what constitutes effective teaching, in general, and your 
specific objectives for the course(s) you teach (or will teach). (Why you teach 
they way you do) 
•	   A statement that demonstrates your knowledge about how students learn in 
your discipline. (Why you teach they way you do) 
•	   A description of the kinds of assessment tools you have used (or will use) in the 
classroom, and a justification for using those tools. (How you know you are 
being effective) 
•   Your plans for developing yourself as a teacher.  

 
As far as format:  
•	   Do not write more than a page or two.  
•	   Assume people outside your field will read your statement, so be careful of 
jargon.  
•	   Take a narrative, first person approach.  

****** 
You should consider this to be a preliminary draft!!  You will have the opportunity to revise 
your statement at the end of the semester
