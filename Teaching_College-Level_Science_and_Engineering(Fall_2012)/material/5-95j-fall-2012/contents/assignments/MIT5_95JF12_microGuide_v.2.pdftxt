 

MICRO-TEACHING GROUP SESSION GUIDELINES 
  

 

 

 
Goals  
•  To encourage participants to think more specifically about the goals of their 
teaching in terms of how students will learn the information presented. This 
involves thinking about teaching style as well as content. 
•  To give participants specific suggestions regarding how their teaching styles are 
perceived by others both within and from outside specific disciplines.  
•  To provide an opportunity to observe and evaluate other styles of teaching and 
to learn how to share observations constructively with others.  

 
General Format  
•  A scribe is appointed for each presentation.  
•  A participant then gives a 6-8 minute presentation, followed by ~5-10 minutes of 
feedback from the audience.  
•  The scribe records the audience feedback. 
 
Presenter Information and Session Preparation  
•  Each participant prepares a 6-8 -minute mini-lecture on a topic in his/her field.  
•  Each participant should plan to begin the presentation with an explicit statement 
of goals for the presentation and the objectives by which she/he plans to achieve 
those goals. These goals can be written on a board, distributed on sheets for the 
audience, displayed on an overhead or slide, or stated at the beginning of the 
presentation.  
•  Each presenter should consider:  
o  the style as well as the content of her/his presentation.  
o  the methodology of her/his presentation  
o  special strategies she/he may need to accommodate students who are not 
experts in the discipline.  

 
Audience Participation:  
•  Group members are expected to participate actively in other’s presentations. 
They should write down any comments they would like to make during the 
feedback period. Their comments should focus on evaluating how well the goals 
articulated by the presenter at the beginning of the talk have been fulfilled. 
Group members can also comment on other aspects of the presentation that they 
may deem important.

Sharing Feedback & Criticism  
•  "Own" your messages.  State your reactions with "I" rather than "you" as audience 
reactions vary. By owning your own reactions, you allow for the possibility of 
different responses.  (You might invite other reactions as well.)  Examples: "I 
appreciated the way you connected your speech to last week's class discussion," 
"I was confused when you said . . . because . . .”  
 
•  Be specific and concrete.  While it might be nice to know that someone liked your 
introduction, it doesn't tell you very much. Instead, one could say, for example, 
"I liked the concrete illustrations of the theory X," or "I liked the way you 
included your own background and interest in the introduction."  
 
•  Focus on presentation behavior, not on personality characteristics and judgments. For 
example, say "I would have liked more eye contact" rather than "It's clear you're 
really not interested in us since you never look at us."  Also, limit comments to 
behaviors that are changeable.  Distracting gestures can be brought under 
control.  Calling attention to a stutter, however, is probably not helpful in a 
public setting. 
 
•  Distinguish between observations, inferences, and judgments.  All of these have some 
role in evaluation but they are quite different.  
o  Observations have to do with what we see and hear; inferences and 
conclusions we reach based on those observations and judgments and/or 
evaluative response.  
o  Listeners observe differently, and, more importantly, draw different 
inferences and judgments from what they see and hear. Therefore, start by 
reporting your observations and then explain what you inferred from 
them. 
o  Speakers can hear a great deal of feedback on observations.  Inferences and 
judgments are better received when the observations they are based on are 
clear.  For example, “I noticed that you made eye contact with the students, 
which made me feel that you were genuinely trying to engage their 
attention.”  
 
•  Balance positive and negative comments. Try to emphasize the positive aspects of a 
presentation which the presenter can build upon constructively in the future to 
improve his/her style.
