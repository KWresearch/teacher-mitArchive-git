ICT4D w/ Victor Serraut 
Information Communictation Technology 
What do these technologies have in common? 

Devices 
Cellphone / computer / Internet / satellites / radio / tv / 
videorecorders / voice recorders / sensors / landlines 

Software & Services 
Databases / Wikis / web content / voicemail / email / SMS / GPS / 
GIS 

Network 
Internet 

Power Systems 
Solar Cells 

How does this relate to development? 
ICT 4 D 0.0 1950s – 1990s 
First computer in India in 1966 
IT for back office applications in government and 
private sector 

ICT 4 D 1.0  1990s – 2000s 
The internet appeared, and changed everything. People 
went crazy. Some say that it certainly had to improve 
international development. 

Millenium Development Goals 

Telecenters – fill a room with computers and 
connectivity, show people how to use them, and put this 
information at their disposal. A quick easy solution. 
Media Lab Linkos Project – shipping container
 with computers and satellite dish 
Satellite is expensive $1000/month for 4mbps 
(vs Victors Comcast for $50 at 4mbps) 

ICT 4 D 2.0 2000s onwards 
Cellphones (will save the world?) 
Have a critical view, will it be a big change, 
or be the next Telecenter? 
Beneficiaries as creators and consumers 

5. Automated is cheaper and better 
issues of full automation 
barrier of cost, literacy, unfamiliarity 
users prefer for voice and human-mediated 
systems (this is a very interesting point, where does 
the research for that come from?) 

6. Information is the bottleneck 
information is one of the many deficiences 
Other problems: human capacity / economy / 
infrastructure / politics 
Information doesn’t equal education 

Myths of ICT4D
1. Technology will save the world 
before it was telecenters 
still many people with few phones 
children of poor families unlikely to have phone 
ownership does not equal usage 
shared vs personal use 
usage does not equal sophistication 
quote from master the machine “it brings the world 
together, it joins the hemispheres… born to be the herald of 
piece” about the telegraph, written in 1860. The same thing can be 
said of cellphones today. 

2.Technology undoes “rich getting richer” 
or “the internet democratizes” 
the value that comes from technology is not 
the same, depending on where you are 

3.If you build it, they will come 
human beings don’t do what is best for them 
people don’t save, we live for the day 
10% of curable blind don’t go have surgery, 
even when its free 
Messing around on Facebook instead of doing problem sets 

4.Poor people have no alternatives 
Social Networks = Free 
Government Health clinic = Free
 (may take a lot of time, and hassle) 
Government Agriculture Extension = Free 
There are alternatives, it might not be free,
 but there are alternatives 

How much does email and those things provide benefit? 
There are some students that use email, and 
study or go into town 
The people in the Daknet Video, are using the 
e-commerce platform to help their business. And not 
using email at all. 

How does this compare to sending by post? 
Technology is a small part of the system 
It is the services that are run on top 
of the infrastructure 
This worked at a time when WiFi was all the rage. Now 
there is movement of Daknet into cellphone utilization 

Coveragemaps.com/gsmposter.com maps of  GSM 
(cellphone) coverage in the world 

Business investors wanted to invest in service providers, 
so DAknet changed from originally viewing themselves 
as a hardware provider to a service provider 

EXAMPLES OF ICT4D 
United Villages : Access for All 
First Mile Solutions 
Look it up online if you want more information 
Targeting bottom of pyramid 4billion people living in rural areas 
Give them a digital identity, email/phone number/web access 
Tel Cos don’t reach out to rural areas because of the decrease 
in population density, there is less of a pay off for addressing 
their needs (don’t recover costs of infrastructure) 
Chart of the cost comparison of different technology 
implementation options 

DakNet 
Builds on the infrastructure of the road 
A bus already travels along the road, 
so attach a “hotspot” to it 
Done in 2003? 
Types of services on this First Mile Application 
Core: Email / Cached Web browsing / 
voicemail over IP 
Supported: eGovernment / telemedicine / remote 
learning  / remote / agricultural sensor / 
village commerce / microcredit 
Village Commerce is driving the business now 

Store-and-Forward system is lower cost and better 
Villagers share access devices (can’t afford own) 
Asynchronous form of communication 
Both parties don’t have to be online at same time 

Mobile Phone Revolution 
Huge Change, Huge Impact 
From no computing or communication to ubiquitous 
and mobile computing and communication 

Many countries leapfrogging traditional  

technologies to cellphones


A similar leapfrog of technology with solar power, 
 some villages may never be connected to the grids 

Video 

The multiple uses of a cellphone 
Emergency / commerce (fisherman) / 
money transfer 
Company examples: 
Assured Labor / Click Diagnostics / Question Box 

Issues and Challenges 
Technical 
Social and Cultural 
Economic 

KEY LESSON 
Technology is only part of the solution
When implementing a solution, think about the cultural, human and 
economic factors that will make a project successful.
