Sowing the Seeds for a more Creative Society 
ICT for Creativity 

“Risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things” 
Innaguration address Janurary 20, 2009 Obama 

creating, building and inventing, being makers of things 

The idea that one of the best ways to engage to people, is to 
build an event 
It is great that the message is being promoted
 by the president of the USA 
We live in a society where it is important to 
create build and invent 
To empower people 

Unfortunately, many education systems around the world, do not 
support this 

No matter where people are in the world, they are going to be 
able to do this. Situations are changing so quickly, that it will be 
necessary. 

Why hasn’t education embraced this? 
Traditional education is transmission of information 
from instructor to learner 
New technologies have a chance to change this 
A computer doesn’t immediately change this 
Its current dissemination only replaces 
the instructor with computer 
We need to move technology to move away 
from this model 

Information Society – how people traditionally 
think of our society 
Just have access to info 
doesn’t change thing 

Knowledge Society – more than information… 
not enough 

Creative Society – help people to create things, 
be creative citizens 
Knowledge isn’t enough unless you 
have creative solutions 

ICT as Innovation and Creative Technologies 
More than information 
communication technologies 

Mitchel has been inspired by kindergarden 

“I want people to build things 
that are meaningful to them”
having a workshop to have children build things that 
would be useful to them in their life 

People are getting access to computers to browse/ 
chat/playing games 
Want to move away from that to help develop 
creativity to create 

Scratch software to create a means 
for people to express themselves creatively 

0.1% of people are creating those animations, while 
the other 99% just consume. I want to change 
that dynamic so more people create. 

Want to see new technologies as a craft material 

Scratch Demo in Class 

Reflections: 
- precursor to programming 
- thinking systematically 
- collaborative design, working  with each other 
versus working together 

These are key things for everyone around the 
world to be doing, the goal then is to give them 
these experiences so that they can work in these 
ways
