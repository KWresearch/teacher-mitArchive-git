What is this project doing to the environment?

Human Development and Ecological Footprint 
Income – standard income vs purchasing parity 
Health 

Our quality of life is linked to our environmental impact 
It is not completely linear 
The last 20% of human development 
makes a large difference 

Definitions of Sustainability 
Bruntland Commission Definition – has been quoted endlessly 
People, Profit, Plant - John Elkington 
Widely adopted by business 
Both have serious flaws associated with them 

Environment > Society > Market 
The market has to pass through society to interact with 
the environment

Sources or Sinks 

Hopenhagen – marketing ploy to surge around Copenhagen 
Successful? Maybe not (poll in class shows little awareness) 

350 – 350 ppm carbon in the atmosphere 
We are currently growing at 2ppm/yr 
Gives us 20 years to sort this out 

Natural Capital
Talking about the resources of the environment and 
the services they provide 
16-54 trillion US$ (when global value of market 
was 30 trillion) 
raises questions, are we creating
value as humans with technology? 
Around the world, a big natural resource is fuel 
(in various forms) 
Gas / biomass / 
Species Extinction 
25% by 2050 

Carrying Capacity of Resources
1.Measure carrying capacity 
(hard to do in dynamic system) 
2.  Have to stay under carrying capacity 
3. Have to be well adapted 

Example of collapse of Atlantic cod in the pacific 

Resource Footprint 
Example of London needing more land than has land for 
Have to go an extract resources from
 elsewhere (ie developing countries)

In Class Energy Challenge
How long before ceramic liner in 
a stove pays for itself? 
20kg Steel / Ceramic Liner 5kg 
To Act, you have to come
up with a number yourself
that you feel confident in. 

Increasing a standard of living is not the same as an increase in 
consumption 
There are examples of high standards of living that don’t 
have the impact of the US 
(WWF Living Planet Report fig 22) 

Energy Consumption and relation to Population  (US) 
When wood was main source, population was very bound to 
natural resources 
Gas and fossil fuels have decoupled the relationship 

Law of the Minimum 
Globalization & trade, allows us to maximize our use of 
carrying capacity 
Not a lot of room for error 
Artificially sets a population limit 
Define Context 
- Need to define a context to characterize resource consumption 
- Population / resources / carrying capacity 
- Can’t talk in the abstract 
- Manage to this context and what is available 
- Define Resources 
-Use fewer resources / Use better resources / Abundant resources 
High quality resources 
Managed resource 

Selco & Envirofit examples
Solar lighting where other fuels weren’t there 
made sense in rural India 
Retrofitting 2-stroke engines to improve fuel 
use and decrease environmental impact 
Both Selco and Envirofit are going towards stoves 
The stove represents an Energy Challenge
