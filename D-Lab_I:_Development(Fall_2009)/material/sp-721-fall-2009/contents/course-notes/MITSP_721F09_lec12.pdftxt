Rural Electrification
• 800,000,000 have been connected to 
power grids in the last 2 decades
• 2,000,000,000 are still not connected
• Decentralization is the key
– Solar
– Micro-hydroelectric
– Wind
– Biogas

Rural Electrification
• Health clinics
• Schools
• Small industry and enterprise

Energy for Cooking
• 2,400,000,000 people use biomass 
(wood, charcoal, dung) for cooking 
• Poor people can spend about 1/4 of 
their income on energy for cooking
• In some areas, women spend 4-6 
hours a day, walking up to 10 km to 
gather firewood

Health Hazards
• Deforestation leads to decline in agricultural 
production which leads to malnutrition 
• Deforestation causes erosion which leads to 
flooding and siltification of reefs and fisheries
• 1,800,000 people die each year of illness 
related to smoke from cooking fires (single 
largest cause of death in under-five-year-
olds)

Possible Solutions
• Alternative fuels
• Efficient stoves 
• Smoke hoods
• Solar cookers

Alternative Fuels
• Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG)
• Kerosene
• Biodiesel
• Biogas
• Charcoal from agricultural waste 
products

Problems with 
Alternative Fuels
• Infrastructure and distribution 
systems
• Specialized equipment
• Cultural Acceptability

Biogas
• Methane gas produced from 
human and/or animal waste
• Chemical process is most 
efficient between 30°C and 40°C
• Provides fuel for cooking and 
lighting

Biogas
• 1 m3 of biogas
– Lights a 60 W bulb for 6 hours
– Runs a 1 HP motor for 2 hours
– Cooks 3 meals for a family of 5 or 6

Cultural Challenges
• Cultural taboos about working with manure
• Religious taboos against working with human 
waste
• Other uses of feedstock
– building material
– fuel
• Changes in cooking behavior
• Changes is the social hierarchy

Construction 
Challenges
• Cost reduction
• Maintenance 
• Supply chain
• Transportation and storage of gas
• Drying and packaging of effluent
• Other opportunities for income generation

Biodiesel
• Has the highest BTU content of any 
alternative fuel, comparable to diesel
• Comes from vegetable oils that have 
been transesterified to reduce their 
viscosity
• Can be used in diesel engines without 
modifying them

Efficient Stoves
• Most traditional cooking stoves 
are about 10% efficient
• Improved stoves have increased 
efficiency of 20-25%

Problems with Efficient 
Stoves
• Specialized equipment
• User behavior can influence 
efficiency 
• Cultural acceptability
