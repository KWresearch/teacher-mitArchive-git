Panel Discussion 
Bish Moderates Invited Fellows 
Professionals from around the world, who come to MIT for a 
year. Have experience in the field 

Bish’s questions 
Etiquettes or protocol (how do you connect to culture) 
Largest cultural differences with USA 
Technological changes with positive impact 
Examples of tech that stayed with local people 
when outsiders left 
Factors that contribute to success 

Ugay Tanzin – Bhutan / city planner urban planner/architect 
Francisco Beretto – Mozambique / public works advisor 
Delmo G – Brazil / forest engineer 
Nadin H – Lebanon / engineer 

Advice to those traveling to the field:
Ugay – you will find people are well disposed to stories of 
foreigners. Won’t find much hostility. Look closely to what you 
do and what you don’t do. One  important thing is the way you 
dress, compared to the US (where it is very casual). Bhutan is a 
traditional country. Have generations of people living together. 

Francisco – portugese is main language. If you want to make 
something with people, you have to involve them. Not the same as 
America where you go it alone. The last projects he has worked 
on with the community, were chosen by the communities. The 
communities are interested in having feedback and seeing the 
results of projects. 

Delmo – don’t have sex in the community. You have to 
stay focused with what you are doing. Technology… 
work with people to understand the reality of the 
situation. Understand the reality of the community. 
This can change from community to community within 
the same culture. (Bicycle example) 

Nadia – Lebanon is a conservative society. Formal 
clothes in meetings and specific greetings are 
expected. Eating is not polite in meetings or classrooms. 
She noticed that coming to America, every seminar 
has food. Meeting with community members, be sure to 
target the leaders and approach and work with them. 

Politics of working in community:
Ugay – thinking of Bhutan specifically, you are 
expected to have all your travel plans in order before 
you leave for the place. Have you contacts and plans 
set. Bhutan is very small, so it is very hard to get in. 
Francisco –  ??? 
Delmo – have to gain the trust of the communities. 
Understand that there are others who have been 
there before you 
Nadia - ?? 

How to manage expectations of coming
from MIT, and not having answers?
Ugay – Have time, go and observe what people really need. Rather 
than asking. Bhutan has lots of forests and use wood for stove 
cooking. Consumes a lot of wood, and has health issues because of 
smoke. Bhutan is very interested in fuel issues (around forests 
conservation and health) for cooking. 

Francisco – to make a project successful, look into ways to 
work with business, and allow this project to make money for the 
community. (financial viability) 

Delmo – the answer to the problem is with the community, not with 
you. Sometimes the solution is not a technology, it is a method, that 
a technology is part of. Understand the reality of the situation, 
and then you can make a real difference to people 
Something you are very proud of:
Ugay – there are lots of projects I am happy with. Just being an 
urban planner, I am one of only 4 in the country. There are only 40 
architects, aren’t that many professionals. 
Working on a Planning Act for his country while here at MIT, and 
looks forward for that coming to fruition (hopefully). Designed a 
meeting hall, that has been constructed, and now allows for 10,000 
people to gather. 

Delmo – a project where he didn’t give the fish, but taught how 
to fish. A project that the community doesn’t need him anymore. 
Assisted the people to do their own urban planning. 

Bish: 
My impression is that the community is not a 
homogenous entity. There are different aspects to it. 
What should students not do that would 
make things more difficult for them:
Ugay – listen to those who come out to speak with you. 
But look for other parts that don’t come out. Make 
an appointment to go and see different elements. 
Doesn’t see as such a problem in US where people are 
encouraged to speak their mind, in Bhutan, it is not the 
same, some people don’t have the confidence to speak 
in public. 

Nadia – as a female engineer going to a site and 
giving instructions to male workers, has encountered 
resistance to acceptance of her ideas. Encourages 
women to be strong and insistent if you believe in what 
you are doing. 

Lessons from unsuccessful projects:
Delmo – a group of women working with handcraft of 
vegetable fibers.. they but they didn’t come back to 
document the work to see where it went. 
Overcoming language barriers
and involving the community:
Ugay – sometimes translators don’t do a good job… 
finding some way to assess your translator 

Delmo – that is a good point, because I am talking a lot 
about understanding the reality of the situation. And 
language is an important element to that. 

Francisco – 

How to maintain long term
impacts with the community:
Delmo – for community, it is personal. They understand 
you are from an institution, but in the end, you know 
the people. 
Working with women in the community, how to
get to that second level of communication: 
Francisco – find a contact outside the mainstream 
contact.. 

How to engage the community in participatory manner: 
Delmo – google it… PRE (participatory rapid appraisal) relations 
inside the community and other institutions. How do people work, how 
do they use natural resources. 

Ugay – important to come to understanding of ideas, and 
misunderstandings can happen. Listen to them from local 
perspective of what they think. Know your area of expertise and 
what their expertise is. 

Bish – have to tell them, that your idea is just another way, not 
THE way 

Francisco – change is something radical at times. Make a 
compromise of what your project is and where the community is. 
Use your skill to make things work for both you and community. 
How to show results and impact when action
and impact are far from each other:
Nadia – show them a similar project in another country. Let them 
know that it was done in another place, and show the results that 
happened there, and the time it took to happen. 

Delmo – showing people the cycle of water, so they understand 
what is happening to water. This helped in one situation to show 
people what was going on. 

Francisco – in Mozambique, there can be resistance to adding 
chemicals to water. Have to find ways to show that the product 
isn’t harmful. 

Amy – understand what people believe about water, from 
experience of working with people have having water workshops. 
Understand what people understand about water. Part of this is 
also establishing trust, listening to people, and incorporating their 
answers into your solution.
