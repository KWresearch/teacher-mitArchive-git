Three Types of Assistance 
Efforts

• Increase the supply productivity of MEs
• Increase the demand for goods and services for MEs (not as 
common as supply–side policies)
• Empowerment

Supply Side Policies

• Provision of credit
• Training of ME owners and workers
• Development of low cost technologies for MEs
• Creation of trade organizations and cooperatives
• Improvement of working conditions and repealing 
government regulations

Provision of Credit

• Basic assumption underlying this approach:  Formal 
financial institutions are reluctant to provide credit 
because:
– 1.) High risk of default
– 2.) High administrative cost of lending
– 3.) Prejudice against poor women
– 4.) Inability of MEs to meet bureaucratic procedures

Provision of Credit
– 5.) Existing loan repayment system not convenient 
for MEs

• As a result MEs have to rely on local money lenders who 
charge very high interest rates.

Lessons Learned About Credit 
Delivery

• MEs are not necessarily a very high risk group if there is 
good outreach to identify good loan candidates and check 
references.
• Use of “solidarity groups” can reduce the need for 
collaterals by creating a social pressure system for timely 
repayment.

Lessons Learned About Credit 
Delivery
• There should be two types of loans: small, short term 
working capital loans, and larger, renegotiable, long term 
fixed asset loans.
• Credit should be extended wisely and at market rate.  In 
case subsidies are necessary, they should be extended in 
forms unattractive to non-target groups.

Lessons Learned About Credit 
Delivery
• There is no evidence to suggest that credit must be 
accompanied with business advice and technical 
assistance.
• In fact, the scale of operation can be expanded quickly if 
assistance is restricted to only credit.

Lessons Learned About Credit 
Delivery
• Most institutions created to provide credit are yet to 
become self-sufficient.
• Mandatory saving schemes have helped create financial 
viability and accountability, but most institutions still rely 
on donors.

Lessons Learned About Credit 
Delivery
• To ensure lending to large numbers of MEs, commercial 
financial institutions should be involved.  Credit 
guarantee schemes help.

Lessons Learned About Credit 
Delivery
• Credit delivery has not reduced, significantly, the role of 
money lenders in credit provision.

Training and Technical 
Assistance

• Key assumptions underlying assistance efforts:
– Low productivity of MEs is due to low level of 
technology used by those enterprises which lack 
technical knowledge necessary for use of better 
technologies
– ME owners lack managerial and business skills
– Training is particularly important for women owners 
who, if they are to be liberated from the drudgery of 
household work, must be taught new skills

Training and Technical 
Assistance
– Learning new skills will not encourage labor mobility 
(skills are firm specific in nature)

Bish Sanyal

Page 14

Lessons Learned
• Management problems are rarely the key factor inhibiting 
growth of MEs.  On the contrary, ME owners are very 
skillful in responding to market fluctuations. 

Bish Sanyal
D-Lab Fall 2008
Page 15

Lessons Learned
• Successful projects did not train ME owners in new 
skills; the key to success was the access to new markets 
for old skills.
• Projects that required new skills and products faltered not 
because ME owners could not learn new skills, but 
because the market for products requiring new skills was 
limited.

Bish Sanyal
D-Lab Fall 2008
Page 16

Lessons Learned
• ME owners rarely agreed to pay for training; and most 
training programs “reimbursed” the trainers for learning 
new skills.  This required subsidies which hurt 
replicability of programs.

Bish Sanyal
D-Lab Fall 2008
Page 17

Lessons Learned
• Training, when it was successful, came as response to a 
real, concrete problem faced by MEs.  This confirmed the 
importance of learning on the job and had to be very 
simple.  

Bish Sanyal

Lessons Learned
• Trained employees often took jobs in formal sector!

Bish Sanyal

Page 19

Lessons Learned
• Behavioral traits, such as risk taking and 
entrepreneurship, cannot be pumped into the poor through 
training programs.  What can be taught are disciplines 
needed for attending meetings, arranging solidarity 
groups and so on.  NGOs are good at these sorts of 
activities. 

Bish Sanyal

Lessons Learned
• Can the productivity of service sector as compared to 
manufacturing jobs, (which is the largest share of MEs) 
be increased through training?

Bish Sanyal

Technological Change
• Key assumptions underlying assistance efforts
– Low productivity of MEs and poor quality of their 
products result from the use of inferior technologies.
– MEs would like to upgrade their technologies, be 
more productive, and sell more (or new) products but 
cannot do so because:

• they do not have the capital to purchase new 
technologies

Bish Sanyal
D-Lab Fall 2008
Page 22

Technological Change
• They lack the skills necessary for using new 
technologies and
• Appropriate technologies ( simple and 
inexpensive) do not exist because research 
institutions which generate technological 
inventions cater to the needs of large scale, formal  
firms.

Bish Sanyal
D-Lab Fall 2008
Page 23

Lessons Learned:
• To induce technological change in the production process 
without significantly increasing the price of production is 
very difficult as MEs are worried about losing market 
share because of cost increases.
• Lumpiness of investment necessary to reorganize 
production technologies is a risk for MEs who worry 
about competition from large firms which can adopt new 
technologies quickly.

Bish Sanyal
D-Lab Fall 2008
Page 24

Lessons Learned
• MEs prefer new technologies for marketing than for 
production.  When new technologies for production were 
adopted, they were not meant to produce new products, or 
create new production processes, but very low cost 
changes were adopted to reduce the vulnerability of ME 
workers to health hazards.

Bish Sanyal
D-Lab Fall 2008
Page 25

Lessons Learned
• Well established research institutions have been generally 
unsuccessful in devising and disseminating “appropriate 
technology” for MEs.  Though some efforts have been 
made, none have made the impact of, say, “the green 
revolution”.   One factor that prohibits large-scale impact 
is the predominance of service providers among MEs.

Demand-Side Policies:
• Aimed to generate new demand for ME produced goods 
and services from 
– 1.) private consumers
– 2.) private formal sector firms, through either 
subcontracting or piece-rate work
– 3.) public sector firms and businesses

Bish Sanyal

Demand from Private 
Consumers:
• Key assumptions
– 1.) Relatively high income consumers can be induced 
to shift their purchasing preferences towards buying 
from MEs.
– 2.) Low income consumers can be induced to 
continue to buy from MEs and increase their 
purchasing when disposable income increases.

Bish Sanyal
D-Lab Fall 2008
Page 28

Lessons Learned
• 1.) There is no evidence, as yet, of successful strategies 
which induced upper income consumers to buy more 
from MEs.  Instances where assistance was provided to 
improve the packaging and appearance of ME produced 
goods to attract upper income consumers have not had 
much impact.

Bish Sanyal
D-Lab Fall 2008
Page 29

Lessons Learned
• 2.) It is hard to test whether low income consumers would 
behave differently if their income increased.  Little 
evidence that exists indicates that the income elasticity of 
demand of goods and services produced by MEs may be 
negative, partly because of advertisements.

Political Mobilization through 
MEs
• Key Assumptions:
– 1.) MEs are not politically conscious of their rights as 
citizens because dominant political institutions did 
not care to mobilize them politically.
– 2.) Solidarity groups which were created to repay 
loans could also be used for raising the consciousness 
of MEs.

Bish Sanyal
D-Lab Fall 2008
Page 31

Political Mobilization through 
MEs
• Key Assumptions
– 3.) MEs are particularly appropriate for the purpose 
of raising political consciousness because they 
provide immediate economic benefits without which 
the poor may be reluctant to spend time in discussing 
political issues.

Bish Sanyal
D-Lab Fall 2008
Page 32

Lessons Learned
• 1.) There is no evidence of a project having mobilized the 
MEs, the group continues to function as an independent 
political force.  In fact, successful implementation of 
projects required the approval of local elite and political 
party officials from the area.  So, successful projects 
could never mobilize the MEs around fundamental issues, 
such as uneven distribution of economic resources and 
political power.

Bish Sanyal
D-Lab Fall 2008
Page 33

Lessons Learned
• 2.) Projects in which the beneficiaries shared ethnic, caste 
or religious backgrounds created a cohesiveness good for 
group dynamics.  These same factors, however, 
prohibited large-scale mobilization involving many 
groups because that group worried about losing their 
identity and opposed opening their organizations to 
“outsiders”.

Bish Sanyal
D-Lab Fall 2008
Page 34

Lessons Learned
• 3.) Mobilization of MEs almost always focused on the 
owners, not their workers, who are more vulnerable 
politically.  And, even in organizing MEs, no attempt was 
made to link them to dominant political parties.

Bish Sanyal
D-Lab Fall 2008
Page 35

Lessons Learned
• 4) The ME projects did contribute to the creation of a 
political constituency, not of MEs but of young, middle 
class youth who worked for NGOs which implemented 
ME projects.  It was in the interest of this group that 
donors continue to support ME projects unconditionally.
