History of Development (Continued): 
Beyond  the  appropriate  technology  movement,  another  revolution  in  development  that  has
strongly  influenced  D-Lab  is  the  participatory  development  movement.  The  participatory 
approach  contrasts  greatly with  the didactic  approach, which  is  probably what most  students  at 
MIT  are more  familiar with  using. A  didactic  approach  has  assumptions  built  in  about efficiency
and  the  appropriateness  of  the  proposed  solution,  whereas  a  participatory  approach  tries  to 
engage  with  the  community  to  jointly  determine  what  are  the  needs  and  priorities  to  be 
addressed. What  if a community’s greatest challenges are not  the ones we are  even capable of 
addressing? This  is why we  should have  some  idea of what  the  community wants before going 
in to introduce the technology we are thinking about contributing. 

Facilitators  of  participatory  development  exercises  must  be  truly  interested  in  what  they  are 
facilitating.  Stakeholder  analysis  is  a  big  part  of  this  approach,  and  there  is  a  very  conscious 
effort  to  try  not  to  marginalize  vulnerable  populations.  It  is  also  important  to  have  open 
communication  throughout  the  process  to  avoid  surprises  where  key  stakeholders  in  the 
community change their mind about collaborating, which risks leaving us in the dark with wasted 
work  and  no way  to  continue  helping. One  idea  to  take  away  from  this  class  is  that  there  is  no  
single  way  to  solve  all  problems.  Participation  has  many  examples  in  economics,  politics  and 
education,  but  less  in  the  realm  of  technology.  D-Lab  takes  this  further  by  encouraging 
community  participation  in  the  entire  technology  design  process.  In  co-creation,  technologies 
are developed together in partnership with the beneficiaries of the technology. 

Advantages of participation include: 
•	 Efficiency 
•	 Effectiveness 
•	 Self-Reliance 
•	 Coverage 
•	 Sustainability 

Disadvantages of participation include: 
•  Time required 
•  Resources (Human, Materials) 
•  Expectation Management 
•  Unpredictability

Mitch  Resnick  directs  the  Lifelong  Kindergarten  group  at  the  MIT 
Media  Lab  and  is  the  LEGO  Professor  of  Learning  Research.  He  
works  on  technologies  to  engage  people,  particularly  children  and 
youth,  in  creative  learning  experiences.  Mitch’s  research  group 
developed  the  “programmable  brick”  technology  that  insipired  the 
LEGO  MindStorms  robotics  kit.  He  co-founded  the  Computer 
Clubhouse  project,  a  worldwide  network  of  after-school  centers 
where  youth 
from 
low-income  communities 
learn 
to  express 
themselves  creatively  with  new  technologies.  Recently,  Mitch’s

stories, games, and  animations.  In  addition  to  being  a  professor  of MIT, Mitch  has worked  as  a 
science-technology  journalist and consulted  throughout the world on creative uses of computers 
in education. 

In  todayʼs society,  there  is a pressure  to always be  learning. How do we support people  to  learn
new  things  in creative ways? There is a traditional view of education where students are treated
as  empty  vessels  that  teachers  fill  up with  knowledge. Schools  have  seemed  overcommitted  to
the  didactic  approach.  Can  we  instead  encourage  students  to  explore  a  process  of  design
where  they  imagine, create, play, share,  reflect, and develop  new  ideas? The  important  thing  is
to use a  teaching method, not necessarily specific  technologies, where  there  is  the possibility of
utilizing a greater range of technologies and materials to promote creativity and discovery. What
types  of  structures  and  mechanisms  can  we  build  to  help  foster  creative  behaviors,  such  as 
computer  clubhouses  in  schools?  Another  example  is  Lego  Mindstorms,  which  was  originally
intended to be an  invention toolkit but has ended up being used in ways that were not expected.
A  13-year-old  girl  in  Thailand  has  used  the  light  sensor  in  a  Lego  Mindstorms  kit  to  control  an 
ultraviolet  light,  enabling  her  family  to  attract  insects  for  food.  In  afterschool  pilot  programs,  it
was  found  that  the kids who were getting  in  trouble were  the ones who wanted  to work on Lego
Mindstorms.
