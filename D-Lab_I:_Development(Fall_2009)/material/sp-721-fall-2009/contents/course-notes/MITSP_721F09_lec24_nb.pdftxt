General thinking of peoplel: 
Poor people lack resources, then people give money to 
the gov’t, and the gov’t makes things for them. And 
that will create progress.

 At the end of the day, the history of progress, 
is the dispersion of power. 
- Concentrated power causes problem. 
- Giving aid to central gov’t is a corruption
 creating approach 
- Try to do the same thing to innovation 
(dispersion of power). 
Historical example of property rights in England
 King not being able to tax people, 
and the development of Parliament. 

Because there needed to be a democratic gov’t. 
Compromises king had to make, created checks 
and balances, to the point where Parliament was the 
ruler. Compromises need to be made when there is a 
shortage of power. The more dispersed, the more 
economic value for common means, the greater the 
public good. 

Private Sector Leading
International Development
Gov’t main point is governing. When it gets into other business, it 
distracts itself. 

The question is not “what is the role of gov’t” 
but “how do we get good gov’t” 
How do you make sure you have a good gov’t? 

If the gov’t owns the economy, then that is not a good gov’t. 

There can’t be too much power, that no one can challenge the 
mistakes, or wrong doing of the gov’t. You need newspapers, media, 
businesses. Create jobs and opportunities in many places. Need 
many companies to have good gov’t. 
IE one gov’t, and one company, would be bad 
“Dispersion of power through
innovation and enterprise.” 
Explain china government?
Read a book by Prof. Huang of sloan school 
EXAMPLE: after 76 when Mao died, many villagers took advantage 
of the power vaccum. Defying the rule of communist rule. 
The next gov’t validated that (written in book by jefferey 
sachs). One of the reasons did well, is that 90% of population 
was employed in the villages. Many other things happened. China 
gov’t expected, that they would get Oil money, and farm certain 
projects, but they never found oil. So then in 1982, they opened 
up certain export regulations. The agricultural development 
before, gave rise to entrepreneurship. When gov’t intervened, 
gave rise to many problems. 
“Capitalism gives rise to democracy.”
{radical idea, you may not accept} 
They come about because no one succeeds in preventing them. 
Example of the monarch of England, when entrepreneurs from 
below start to make things happen. It will lead to democracy in 
China. 

On Aid Distribution... 
Limitations to model? 
See the broader picture… If my neighbor is doing 
better, that alone might be good for me. It will be too 
much for any particular model to solve all problems. We 
should leave some problems for you to solve, there are 
lots of things to do. 
ON NGOs role... 
Economic vitality comes from capitalism, from profits. 
NGOs are better than giving money to the gov’t. The 
gov’t belongs to all citizens. If I corrupt the gov’t, 
then I hurt everyone. If an NGO goes out of business, 
I don’t hurt anyone. A business is not doing well, it goes 
down the drain. It is a dispersion of power. Lots of 
NGOs trying lots of different things. Compete with 
each other to get funding. If one NGO goes down, the 
world is not as worse off is gov’t goes down. 
Even better, if you are innovative enough, if you are 
innovative, you create value. 

For Profit can grow organically, can lead to economic 
vitality. An NGO has to find more funding, can’t grow 
organically. NGO still better to fund than to fund a 
gov’t. 

Imagine if we had funded the British Monarch 
from outside, that might have hurt England. What 
if the Pope had provided soldiers, and put down 
democracy? 

Non-profit? Drawing line of
making profit out of poor?
Can be hazard, when there is a non-competative situation. Only 
one person selling aspirin, and selling for high price of extortion. 
Can happen, when a person is in monopoly with government. 
1. Means there is corruption in gov’t, big problem 
2. If I am making too much profit, means someone else will 
find a way to get into business, to make a profit for themselves. 
A self correcting device. Profit is then a good thing (as it allows 
for self correction). 

Competition, and opportunities, can arise from desire to make 
profits. Hiring brothers, getting wages, higher wages when 
competition comes in . 

We are educating young people that profits are bad for 
poor countries. That gov’t don’t work, have an NGO (a non-
government). Solve problems in this country through profit, and in 
poor countries through gov’t. 

On Business 
Better to have someone creating a business, than no one at 
all. Even better, if the local people are. If they can’t, then a 
foreigner creates one, and local guy learns something, then that 
is alright. 

At the end of the day, our set thinking of what is good. We don’t 
need all that thinking. The human brains are the most valuable 
thing. Poor countries have plenty of brains, just not being allowed. 
We think we need to give them resources. 

Poor countries are wasteful… they have time, so that’s a thing 
to waste. Wasting children because they don’t have electricity. 
Have to utilize the things we do have. Haven’t been able to, 
because we’ve been blocking them, and given others the ability to 
block them. (HOW is this happening) 

Intellectual Property
I don’t know what is really necessary. 

Fundamental problem, dealing with country where people 

don’t have any rights, not even property rights. And we 

are thinking about IP rights. There are other problems, 

that people already have. There are real problems 

of property rights, from bad governments of those 

countries, from aid to these countries.

Digital properties in western countries, then Microsoft 

wants to sell software… etc. Thinking of our own 

vested interest. We have started to think of IP rights 

before more basic rights have been addressed.

England used to have ideas, and America stole when 

developing. When America developed enough, then in 

our own interest, we pushed to protect IP. Has to be

underground demand for protection of rights. Another 

reason for bottom of development. That is why there 

is piracy in developing country, desire is not there, 

because there is coming a one way IP.


When is it good to start a business in a place…

We are under the economic burden of thinking we need 

a large opportunity cost, because of our MIT education. 

If you free yourself from that, and think of what you 

are content with. 

Then once you have designed something, and are 

content with it, can re-evaluate it. 

If it is adding value to lives, then you have done 

something useful. 

Depending on your contentment, better to start small, 

easier to manage.

Scales of Capital
AS long as you are CREATING VALUE then I am not so 
concerned with scale. 
If you make one cow produce twice as much milk, then 
you why can’t you take that to other villages? Why is 
everyone so concerned with scale and large amounts of 
money? 
I just don’t think scale matters.
