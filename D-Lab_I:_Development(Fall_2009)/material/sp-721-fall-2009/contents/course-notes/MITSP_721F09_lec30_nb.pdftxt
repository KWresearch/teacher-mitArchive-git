Student: shocked by social structure, and disrespect 
Don’t know which comes from which, AIDS or structure 
Boy shown in film is not entirely typical of Africa 
There is an attitude among population 
of not caring 
It is scary to face something alone, 
dealing with own mortality 
Light of Hope in Zambia, good teacher of HIV 
and related issues, Poso is HIV positive himself 
The sexual norms in different places than US 
IE, in Botswana not getting married until 30s and 
having children already to demonstrate to 
husband you can have kids 
Structure of society and taboos 
to prevent talking about it 

Trials of people knowingly having sex with others while having 
AIDS. Won’t have that effect with Governments in Africa 
(general) Some officials are going through AIDS experience 
themselves 
Additionally, the government isn’t set up to deal with that 

Amy in Botswana 
Seeing lots of advertisements while in 
Peacecorps (86-90) 
That kind of awareness still hasn’t 
completely effected 

Governments getting the message across 
People are getting mixed messages 
Government may say one thing, and 
Pastor may say something else 
Certain programs working effectively to help 

What is different about the Stigma in Africa vs 
Western world 
Particular strain in Africa is more easily 
transmitted through heterosexual contact 
Not considered a disease of homosexuals 
or drug users 
Just a typical disease 
that is transmitted 
Stigma is there (10 years ago it was there) 
It has become normalized 
Student: message is 
“god will heal you” 
People don’t take ARVs 
because of this. 
This also adds to the 
amount of infection rate 

In a simple way, you have always been told by your parents to 
wash your hands because of germs and things. It has set up your 
acceptance of other types of knowledge and information. 

Issue of counterfeit drugs 
Company has a system of SMS system to 
find out if your drugs are real or fake 
This is an issue with different types of drugs 
around the world 
“I heard that 50% of the drugs in Nigeria aren’t real” 
don’t know the factuality of this 

What can be done to change the attitudes of people who don’t 
care… 

I don’t know… It’s sad 

Relation of Social Security and Children 
In many places of the world, children are
 their social security 
People need to know that there is something in place 
  for them, for them to be willing to have fewer children 
State in India that implemented social security, 
and saw decrease in population rates, Carola
