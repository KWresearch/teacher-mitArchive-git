Questions 

1. How can the international community leverage

to ensure accountability? 
Prof. Balakrishnan Rajagopal
Human Rights and Development Planning: Case of the Narmada 

Project


Initially a project between states, then settled by special tribunal  

when couldn’t agree.

Planned since the independence of India.


Opposition based on Human Rights and Environmentalism

Initially, the people around, didn’t know much about the dam.  

They wanted to get more information, about what areas would  

be flooded, etc. Also opposition concerned over environmental  

impacts, because of the diverse amounts of flora and fauna in  

the area. 


Conflict from actors at multiple levels from around 
the world. 
Example: Greenpeace in Japan wanted Japanese 
government to put off loan for purchase of 
generators for x stage of development. 

What is so special about this project? Why so much 
controversy and international attention? 
Many issues: 
Place of dams in India. Former prime minister of India 
described dams as the temples of India. Wanting to use 
development as a way to build a nation, and a sense of 
nationalism. 

A high stakes controversy. 
Any criticism of dams is seen as being 
anti-national, while support for dams 
is seen as facist. 

The purpose of the dams described as (classical large 
scale dam justification) 
Flood control, energy, irrigation 

Also about the growing industrial area and its need for 
water 

Most of the water for the dam got used 
for industrial purposes (urban, industry) 
It was sold as a means to “feed the poor” 
A bunch of industrialist behind the agenda 
They won’t say this upfront, 
because that doesn’t sell 

Government at various levels with multiple and overlapping 
responsibilities 
Under India’s constitution, water is under control of states 
While the Federal Gov’t has control over interstate 
water regulation 
State responsible for restructuring and rehabilitation 
Federal Gov’t answers to World Bank saying will you 
take care of R&R. 
Not easy to get political consensus with such diversity 
Issues raised by dam
Hydrology – how much water was in the river. How much was  

flowing through. Dispute among scientist about how much was  

there. Became less an issue of science, as it was political

Health – particularly over malaria. Shift of flow of river, leading 

to increase in mosquitos 

Safety – the area sits over an earthquake zone.

Environment – 

Human Rights – PAPs (project affected people) what to do  

with them? Who counts as people effected by the project. 

Those who are flooded out. People with title to property.  

Landless cash laborers, who provide services. Fisherman who need  

fishing areas for a living, don’t need land, but have lost livelihood.  

People effected by canals, to get water from dam to urban  

areas.

Rights of indigenous (tribal) people – free and prior 

consent to move

Right to livelihood, people being asked to remove themselves from 

land. Land is more than physical, connection to resources, social 

network, community. Access to traditional sources of value (a 

forest with herbs, medicine, etc). Land for land doesn’t translate 

into this element. Land for lands makes sense for agricultural 

people, but doesn’t meet the ecology of a place. Land for land a 

poor substitute.


Led to criticism of World Bank 
First time WB had independent 
evaluation of own project 
To big and to visible 
Had a scathing criticism, leading 
to WB pulling out funding in 1993 
Led to changes in WB 
Formation of World Bank 
Complaints Panel 

Lesson  from World Bank and World Commissions of Dams 
See PPT Notes 

Questions 

OED report didn’t explain, but noted that WB violated  

its own policy. EIA not being issued before the World 

Bank approval.


How do you stop it?

Some say you can’t

Large projects like this are skeptical in their delivery 

of what they promise.


The night and day of proposed plans and the reality on 
the ground 
Designers giving PPT presentation of plans to 
WB, that said they would address all problems.
