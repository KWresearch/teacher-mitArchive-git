D-Lab Energy 
That picture that people show a lot… 
a picture of the world at night 

A lot of the areas we are going to, have very little light 
India has done a lot of rural electrification 
Maybe not on household level 
Illustrates the need for household electrification systems 

Two Types of Electrification 
Urban – lots happens through theft 
Cats claws in Brazil 
Welders on side of road in Haiti 
“People finding a way to make it happen” 
Rural 
large chunk of people connected in last 2 decades 
Lots of people too far from grid 
Centralized energy doesn’t work for them 
Decentralized is more affordable and effective 

Alternative Energy/Fuels 

Biogas
Methane from human or animal waste 
More efficient fermentation with 
these than plant 
Provides fuel for cooking and lighting. 

Household Superdome Digester
Has to be close the home 
Almost always on site 
Lots of municipal garbage sites will have 
digesters and produce methane 

Biogas digester in Honduras 
Leak resistant bag, filled with waste 
Often cattle provide fuel source 
Gas is regulated by the digester 
Manual process 
Can be managed 

EFFICIENT STOVES 
Traditional cooking stoves are 10% efficient 
Heat eminates in all directions, 
not just towards pot 
Fuel efficient stoves require special equipment 
Behavioral change and acceptance 
Similar to solar cooker 

People like to use wood stoves 
They like the way it cooks 
They are familiar with it 

There is not silver bullet technology, rather a 
portfolio of technologies, because different things will 
be effective in different environments. 

HOMER / small scale energy system modeling program 

Talking about dealing with cultural barriers of using human waste 
in digesters 

Floating Drum Digestors 
Moves up and down. 

India + China have mature biogas digestion technologies 

CONSTRUCTION CHALLENGES 
Cost / Material / Environment 
Digging in the ground to get 
warmer temps in cold areas 
Transportation and storage of gas 
Income Generation 
Cost of digester recovered through food selling 

BIODIESEL 
Highest energy content compared to other fuels 
From vegetable oils 
To use in engines, have to reduce viscosity 
through transesterfication
