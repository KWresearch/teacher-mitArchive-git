Water Quality Testing 
You can’t see bacteria 
Make it visible, in a way you can acknowledge its presence, 
or count how many are there 
Give it a food, metabolizes and turns certain color 
Different waste products 
produce different colors

Don’t want to set off every bacteria 

Grow them at 98.7 (human temp)

Food. Environment. Temp 

Method 1 
Choliform turns yellow 

Method 2 
Sulfur reducing bacteria, will turn black (rotten eggs) 
Test tubes aren’t reusable 
Wasteful 
Expensive for resource strapped community 
To reuse, have to sterilize tube 

Presence absence test 
YES or No are they there? 

Quantify
2 Methods 
Petri Film

Measure 1ml of water

Place on dried gelatin

Red and blue colonies

Red = choliforms 
blue = fecal choliforms 
You will be able to count them 
Problem, small sample size 
Normally quantified 
by 1 per 1000 parts (?) 

Method 2 
Take larger water sample 
Pull sample through filter paper 
All bacteria in sample are 
deposited on paper 
Save filter paper, place on petri dish, 
grow to see what is there 
Then you can count how many bacteria 

It is all about growing and changing color 

Method 2 device costs a lot of money, $850 - $1000 
So D-Lab made a cheap device, 
with a baby bottle 
Sterile inserts adapted to baby bottle, 
for about $20 
D-Lab, what we think is how we can make
everything cheaper
Easy to replace parts 

Incubate them at warm temp. 
Field incubators cost $1200 and need electricity 
Most places don’t have electricity 
Have to do test in 6hrs of timing 
D-Lab wanted to make a kit that could be tested in field 

Phase Incubator, based on phase change material to maintain temp 
of 37 for 24hrs 
Recent news from Peru that the phase change incubator 
is comparable to an electric incubator, go Amy’s invention 

Have students do a bunch of water quality testing 
Important, to test bacteria in water, not on hands or in mouth 
Simple sterilization techniques 
Alcohol + flame 
The only thing you will use to touch things that come in 
contact with water, forceps 
“Edward Forcepts Hands” 

Sterilization order 
Ring, Filter Paper, Mesh, 

Running blanks to make sure that your test are not 
contaminated 
Once every 20 tests maybe
