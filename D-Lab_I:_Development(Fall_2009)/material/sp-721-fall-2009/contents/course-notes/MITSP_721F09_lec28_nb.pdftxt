Concrete 
Cement, concrete, mortar 
Concrete is cement, aggregate and sand 
Mortar is sand and cement 
Aggregate: sand : cement 
Concrete : 3:2:1 
Mortar: 0:3:1 
Porous Blocks: 8:2:1 

Important things: 
Mix well before adding water 
Crystalline structure forms when water is added 
Mix well while adding water 
Mix well after adding water 

Making concrete on the field, will most likely be with shovels on 
the ground 
Everybody thinks they know how to make concrete, but they 
probably don’t 
Mix well, mix well, mix well 

Keep concrete wet, so that water in the matrix can form 
crystalline bonds, water is part of the chemical process that 
makes concrete hard 
Marine cement continues to gain cement for up to 20yrs 
(pylons in water) 
Try hard for it not to dry out 
If you can keep it wet for a full week, great 
Cement SETS it doesn’t DRY 

Information Society – how people traditionally 
think of our society 
Just have access to info 
doesn’t change thing 

Knowledge Society – more than information… 
not enough 

Creative Society – help people to create things, 
be creative citizens 
Knowledge isn’t enough unless you 
have creative solutions 

ICT as Innovation and Creative Technologies 
More than information 
communication technologies 

Mitchel has been inspired by kindergarden 

“I want people to build things  

that are meaningful to them”

having a workshop to have children build things that 
would be useful to them in their life 

People are getting access to computers to browse/ 
chat/playing games 
Want to move away from that to help develop 
creativity to create
