The Value of Indigenous Knowledge
Example of charcoal briquettes and extinguishing them 
People asking how to extinguish briquettes, D-Lab always 
hedging questions, and trying to make briquettes non-soluble in 
water. 

Local Teen presented idea to extinguish with sand. 
He may have lived far from river, so this was 
natural to him, and not to everyone else. His 
knowledge and experience has value. 

Finding the local expert, has value. 
Student example of wanting to research high altitude 
vegetables OR what they ended up doing, which was asking the 
Priest who is already growing fruits and vegetables in his green 
house what he grows. 

If you ask a question, the appropriate thing to 
do, is to stop, and then listen to the answer. 
How you ask and phrase the question 
shapes the answer you get. 
- What is the information you want to get? 
- Who are you going to ask? 
- How are you going to ask? 
People have a tendency to ask
questions to get particular answer 

Cross-Cultural Communication and Lessons: 

Example 
Handing money with hands vs tossing it. 
The cultural significance of the act. 
Important to reflect about what happened, 
and why it happened. 
Be objective, and see 
what really happened 

There may be times, when you don’t know what 
to do, and the default of doing nothing can also be a 
strong message. 

Good to be able to ask someone, and have identified 
that person before hand
