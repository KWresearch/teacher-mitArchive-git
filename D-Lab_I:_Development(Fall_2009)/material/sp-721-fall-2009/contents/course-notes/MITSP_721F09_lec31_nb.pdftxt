Problems and Solutions
 Try and come up with solutions that others 
have been grappling with for years 

Public Health – large centralized infrastructure to keep the 
general population healthy 
Access to doctors, medicine, awareness, 
preventative, treatment 
This exists in many places in the 
developing world (government) 
Also other organizations that take care 

Humanitarian Aid – 
first measure responses to humanitarian situations 
- Tsunami, refugee camps, humanitarian evacuation system 
- This is how a lot of people get into Public Health initially 
- Many humanitarian aid responses are reflective of the 
reaction in everyday life 

Burden of Disease 
Potential life + productive life = Disability Adjusted Life Years 
Measuring how healthy a country is. Measuring the work 
of a healthy individual against disabilities (disease, 
permanent injury) and mortality 

What people die from and suffer from 
on a daily basis are different 

Gives people an idea of where they might want to have an impact 

D-Lab Approach
How can you come up with more tactical 
approaches that can have a result/impact within 2 
years. (Other options might be impacts over 30 years) 
90% of medical equipment is hand
me down that fails within 6 months 
environmental issues 
(leaky roof that shorts equipment) 
technicians not taking care of equipment 
(world cup / ultra sound / color monitor) 

Dual-Use Technologies 
Find things that can be developed here 
and used in developing world 
Military is a huge source of this 
Camping gear 
Similar parameters of a 
lack of infrastructure 

Medicines 
Two-market pricing systems 
Major reason to compete with local 
production that can reverse engineer and make a 
generic alternative (India, Brazil, China all have very 
good capabilities in this) 
Balancing IP with the needs 
of country and people 
Vaccines 
Military going to places where soldiers 
are exposed to some of these diseases 

Solutions 
Many diseases have solutions (drugs/devices/diagnostics) 
BAD NEWS 
Not all are easy to deploy 
(Cost/infrastructure/education/regulation) 
People work on solving this aspect the most 
MORE BAD NEWS 
Infrastructure isn’t always easy 
or cheap to respond to 

Case Study
Jet Injector (Peace Gun) 
No needle 
People started to use for other reasons
 - Found it spread Hep B among people being vaccinated 
Vacuum formed in chamber that draws small 
amount of blood from patient, that can 
infect the next customer 
Device since improved with a spacer, 
so device isn’t against skin 
With simple design approaches, you can recover technologies 

Elements for Device Design Success 
Select appropriate design attributes 
Map to design? 
Missed the slide 

Impact/Resource Scale
Technology as intermediate solution 
while vaccines/cures researched 

XoutTB 
Cellphone + encrypted diagnostics to see if 
people have taken their drugs 
Rewarded with cellphone minute credit 
Paying for minutes is cheaper than 
having health worker go and check 
1600 patient trial in Pakistan 
Patients like it 
Health Care workers jobs?
Free them up to do what they
are trained for 
Not trained to write down compliance 

Compliance is a big issue 
$300 Billion lost in US because 
of non-compliance 
Google: compliance and adherence 

Aerovax 
Maintaining the vaccine in a different state 
Don’t need to refrigerate for 7 days 

Microfluidic Chip 
Replace electricity with liquids 
Liquids run to different elements and reagents 

Why Pakistan? 
Because of this serendipitous 
networking occurance 

Attributes for Medical Devices 
Essential 
Safe 
Accurate 
Robust (vials get dropped on floor all the time) 
Longevity 
Cheap (first thing to go is devices, consumibles 
    are purchased, vaccines, while syringes aren’t) 
Reliable 
Reusable/Disposable (varies depending on context) 
Auto-disable syringe (cheaper to buy 
vacuum pack machine and fake new than 
buy new syringes) 

Enhancing 
Mobile 
Connected (enough affordable electronics to 
make things connected, and there are many 
reasons why it should be made connected, devices 
that talk to each other) 
Smart 
Plug n’Play (with other devices) 
Backup via Redundancy 
Long-Term 
Local Mafg 
Local Innovation 

Approaches 
Vintage Technology + New Function (old patents) 
Nerf Gun + Syringe Device 
Improvisation -> Design 
Coke Bottle + Inhaler OptiChamber 
Context Shifting 
Taking device for one setting and apply in another
