Role Play 
•	  Talking about the process 
•	  Simone (the user) couldn’t contribute much to 
the debate about a product 
for her. 
•	  Surprised at knowledge gaps in roles 
•	  Caution with passionate people, who care for 
cause, but don’t know much about the situation on 
the ground

{ •	  There are many approaches to development, 
So as to not marginalize anyone in the process 
D-Lab is one.

consideration
