Water Treatment 
w/ Susan Mercott 

Water Rich – Safe Water 
Water Poor – Unsafe Water 
More than a billion people 

Billion Number – people who lack access to improved  water supply 
Public taps, tube wells, boreholes, protected wells & springs, 
rainwater harvesting 
Unimproved water 
All surface waters (rivers, streams, dams, lakes, ponds, 
canals, irrigation channels) unprotected dug well & springs, tanker 
trucks and carts, vended water 

Tanker trucks and vended water, because they are in nether 
realm of not knowing where the source of the water is. 
As described by the United Nations 

Access to an improved water supply 

IS IMPROVED WATER SAFE WATER? 

4 Water Qualities: 
Microbial – Can kill you quick 
Chemical – Can kill you slow 
Physical/Aesthetic 
Radionuclides 

Microbial is the biggest problem around the world 
Chemical second biggest problem 
Arsenic is a large contributor 

Conventional Water Treatment Plant: 
Source of surface water 2 sedimentation 2 coagulation 2 
sludge 2 filtration 2 cholrine 2 communities 
Out by Frog Pond used to be this kind of system 

Non-piped water supply 
Watershed 2 Human/Animal distribution system 2 Home 
Problem with possible contamination 

64% of Women collect the water 
And are primary caretakers of people who get 
sick with water borne diseases 

Infectious Disease and its effect on children 
Not addressed? 
Been around for a while 
Not going to infect people in 
developed countries 
Hard to identify the cause 

Small Scale Water Treatment (household) 
Not Brita Filter (aesthetic/physical treatment mostly) 
“Luxury Water” 
Mega systems won’t work in rural area 
Cost too much money 
Government infrastructure/willingness 
Access to energy for system (electricity) 
Deer Island Waste Water Treatment Near Logan 

airport 

$4billion for 2.5 million people 
Engineers hadn’t thought of how to scale for different 
environment or materials 

P&G gotten into household treatment water market 
Pur – “treatment plant in a packet” (EXPENSIVE) 
Coagulant (pheric sulfate) + Chlorine (calcium chloride powder) 
Open and put in 10L bucket, rapid mix, let settle 
Chlorine contacts water for 30min, then safe to drink 
Does it work in any water? 
The particular combination P&G has is often perfect 
There is no perfect though, not a one size fits all 

Safe Storage 
Important aspect of water treatment 
Water getting contaminated while in storage is a big problem 
Disinfection 
Boiling, Sodis, Household chlorination 
Particle Removal Technologies 
Cloth Filter – equivalent to sari filter
  1 micron mesh, effective against guinea worm and cholera 
Ceramic Filter 
Lifestraw – not that effective, clogs 
Iodine based resin, okay for short term use 
Not safe for longterm use 
Water Ionizers – more of a first world product 
Combined Systems 
Chemical Removal Systems 

Get an email a day from someone around the world with an idea to 
save the world. Maybe that’s true. Has come to realize that there 
is no silver bullet, high tech or low tech, it is getting it implemented 
that is the challenge. 

Safe Storage Products 
Standard size can go hand in hand with disinfection (ie 
chlorine dosing) 
Partical Removal 

Pure Home Water 
Started with the idea of providing safe household drinking water 
Had been working on multiple technologies for a while 
Now focusing one direction to encompass goal 
Offer range of products in Ghana to see what they liked 
Reach people most in need 
Be self-sustaining 

1. 
2. 

Takes a lot of capacity to test whether water is safe or not 
Check List vs Water Testing Laboratory 
Reasoning behind Improved vs unimproved water source category 
Improving the supply is one way (slightly indirect) 
towards safe water 

Having particles in the water, protects microbes from chemical (ie 
chlorine) treatment 
Microbes can hide in particles 

For Dissemination, focused on Cermaic Filter Pot 
-
Staff could do many products poorly or one product well 
The ceramic filter was their best product, so focused on that 

Manufacturing to bring the cost down 
Local manufacturing to reach $1/day people 
Current manufacture is outside Accra 
12 hours to get to Tamale 
Transportation can damage ceramic filters 
Local manufacturing to have greater 
control over supply chain 
Quality control
