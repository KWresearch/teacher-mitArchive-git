William “Windmill Bill” Kamkwamba 
w/ Bryan Mealer 

Bryan – journalist working in Africa, 6yrs, University of Austin 
Wanted to do more with his life 
Was in the Democratic of Congo during the war 
Wondering about journalist always reporting on the negative 

Hearing about William helped him to fall in love with the Africa again 

William – from Malawi, like Reggae, not so sure after hearing all 
sorts of new music 
Has 4 sisters 
2000 Famine in Malawi 
Family would reduce down to 1 meal a day 
Grinding flour to sell at market, then buy flower that was 
imported from Tanzania. People started substituting sawdust in 
the flour. People becoming very sick. 
William was 13 at the time. And was supposed to start High School. 

William was forced to drop out, because didn’t have 
money to go to school 
William continued to study on his own by going 
to the library, wanted to be alble to keep up with his 
friends 

Studied science, biology, social studies are 
what would have been done in school. At a library funded 
by the US Gov’t. 

William couldn’t read, so he looked at the diagrams 
curious as to how things worked, so looked at 
science books. intersted in Bicycle Dynamo, wanted to 
see how it worked. Dynamos were popluar in Malawi, for 
people cycling at night 

Interested in radios, wanted to take them 
apart, slowly learned how to fix them .Fixed them, and 
used batteries. Didn’t have money to buy batteries to 
fix radios 

Playing around with Dynamos 
Playing around with them, see that they could generate 
power. Being a kid, and getting shocked when disconnecting a light 
from dynamo. 

How to power a bike to generate power to power the radio… 
Made the connection to windmill 
How to build it without knowing English or having materials 
Vivid diagrams of images showing how they worked 
Of a battery, learning what each diagram meant 
Learning elementary physics in this round about way 

Making a prototype windmill in scale, using a Vaseline jar lid for 
the rotor. Purchasing a dynamo for the equivalent of $1US 

The first windmill was not perfect right away. William made 
changes to make it work. Such as changing the bicycle to change 
to a pulley. And using a step up transformer to change from 12V 
to 24V. Also made it to change the current from AC to DC 
Copying a radio transformer… winding metal like it. 

This electrical skills
were something that
William had to teach
himself, because it
was not taught in school. 

Parents felt guilty about William dropping out of school, 
because they couldn’t afford it. 
With girls, parents hope that they might 
get married, and that a husband might help continue 
education, and pay for them or take care of them. 
With boys, it is the parents who must take care of it. 

His father was very PATIENT with William, 
learning on his own, hoping that he might be able to 
pay for him to continue his education. Not making
William go to the fields to work was a real
key to allowing him to learn on his own. 

To some people, there was a sort of Wizardy view of 
William, because magic is very prominent in Malawi. And 
pulling energy from the wind, is somewhat odd. People 
didn’t always believe that the thing could do it. 
Story of a storm, and clearing out, and people 
seeing windmill blowing, thought that it might have 
blown away the clouds. When a storm was needed, for 
watering, because of the drought. 

Failed designs, how do you know when to stop? 
I have not succeeded yet, but I will go back and
 make a biogas digesters. 
His first water pump didn’t work either. 

Started a soccer team
 For other boys who have dropped out of school 
Give them a sense of community, and something 
to do to stay out of trouble. Has spawned local 
businesses of women selling items at the game 

One of the ways to help bring people out of poverty 

William started playing with radios when he was about 10. Taking 
them apart and such. 

Having to make his own tools, didn’t even have a screw driver, made 
it out of bicycle spokes, hammering them flat, and melting plastic 
to make a handle to hold. 
Making knives out of sheet metal, and using small plastic to make 
a handle. 
Making things out of local materials that were available. 

Didn’t have voltmeter, so used creative ways like using 12V 
lightbulbs to test the amount of electricity was put out. Has many 
blown up light bulbs because of this. 

Failed time to make Biogas. His area in Malawi is very deforested. 
William’s mom spent many time to gather firewood. 
Windmill can’t generate enough power to use for cooking, 
so what else can he do instead? Found out about biogas through 
book, out of animal waste. Thought he needed to try this. 
Understand that animal waste + water + heat could generate gas 
that might be used to cook. William isn’t a very patient guy, when 
it comes to working on different things, likes to see the results 
right away. 
Wanted to boil biogas fuel to heat it up, to make it go 
faster. Used his mother’s best pot. Did it in a plastic bag. Hoping 
that the steam would be enough, and put on fire when his mom 
wasn’t around. His mom asked him what he was making… he told her 
that it was sweet potato. “no, potato doesn’t smell like that” 
Wanted to ignite the stuff later.
