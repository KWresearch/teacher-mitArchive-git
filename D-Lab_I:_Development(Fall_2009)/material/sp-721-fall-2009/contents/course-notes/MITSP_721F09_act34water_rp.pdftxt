Teaching Note 

This activity,  framed as a  role play  to  develop a  community water system  committee,  is 
actually about gender  issues.  Students are told  that  they will be designing an  improved 
water system  for a village and as part of  the process must select a Water Development 
Committee.  In  fact,  the  point  of  the  exercise  is  for  students  to  recognize  that  decision -
making  mechanisms  often  exclude  uneducated,  village  women  who  are  most  affected 
by  these  decisions.  It’s  important  to  present a  session  on water  before  this  exercise  so 
that the context of the role play makes sense, and that the students have been exposed 
to the fact that water is overwhelmingly a women’s issue. 

Start the activity by explaining the assignment: designing improvements to a community 
water  system.  The  students  will  form  groups,  create  a Water Development  Committee 
and  then each student will  take on one of  the  roles of  the committee.  They will need  to 
fill in the role play worksheet during class and turn it in at the end of the session.  F inally 
tell them  that  they will  take on  these  roles  in a negotiation session during the next class 
in  order  to  come  up  with  a  proposal  for  improvements  to  their  village  water  supply 
system. 

Students  should  be  divided  into  groups  of  five  or  six  and  given  the  assignment  packet. 
They  will  need  about  ten  minutes  to  read  through  the  material,  and  then  take  another 
fifteen minutes  to  discuss who  should  be  on  the water  committee.  Following  that,  they 
should decide who will  play each  role,  and  take  about  fifteen  to  twenty minutes  to  fill  in 
the  role  play  worksheet. 
If  there  is  time  remaining,  they  can  begin  the  negotiation 
session. 

During  the  second  class,  rather  than  run  the  negotiation  session,  you  should  discuss 
who  they  chose  to  be  on  the  committee  and  why.  To  facilitate  discussion  and  help 
students  remember  and  compare  whom  they  selected,  you  can  project  a  table  like 
Table  1  on  a  PowerPoint  slide  that  shows  the  people  they  selected  for  each  group. 
Each column is a committee, with the D-Lab student in italics on the bottom row.

After  the  initial discussion, confess  that  this wasn’t  really a  role play about water,  it was 
a  role  play  about  gender  issues.  Show  Table  II,  where men  are  shaded,  to  show  how 
many  women  were  on  the  committees  (female  D-Lab  students  are  shaded  lightly 
because it was coincidental that they were women, rather than intentional).

You can also show a table like Table III, that shades in the people who were not actually 
from  the village,  leaving the  truly local participants.  It  is  interesting  to note  that  in many 
cultures, even  though someone  has  lived  in  the  village  for many  years,  there are many 
reasons  why  they  will  continue  to  be  considered  to  be  outsiders—tribal  affiliations, 
language barriers, etc.

From  this point on,  it’s  important  that  the discussion  not  take on an accusatory  tone, so 
that  students  don’t  tune  out  and  instead  learn  from  their  choices  and  recognize  how 
easy  it  is  for  this  exclusion  to  happen.  Students  may  claim  that  it  is  unfair,  because 
there were not many local women on the list.  I emphasize that, as D-Lab students, they 
will be  introduced  to a variety of people within  the community but  they should be aware 
that  the  people  they meet  are  just  a  small  subset  of  those  who  live  in  the  village,  and 
that  extra  effort  may  be  needed  to  ensure  that  there  is  adequate  representation.  For 
this  exercise,  students  may  need  to  choose  people  who  are  not  on  the  list  in  order  to 
exert that extra effort.  It is also worthwhile to mention that language and education tend 
to  be  additional  barriers  to  women’s  participation  and  therefore  it  is  important  that 
students account for this as well. You could assign homework following this assignment, 
reflecting  on  the  exercise  and  addressing  the  issue  of  how  to  encourage  inclusion  so 
that all parties are involved in the decision-making process. 

Village Water System Planning 
Fall 2009 

You  are  on  a  D-Lab  team  working  to  design  a  water  system  for  a  small  village  in  rural 
Botswana.  Your  job  is  to  assemble  a  Water  Development  Committee,  assess  the 
village  water  resources  and  design  a  system  that  will  improve  access  to  safe  water. 
The following is a description of the village where you will be working. 

Metsi a Mangwe, Kweneg District, Botswana 
Official Languages: Setswana, English 
Latitude: -25º 10’  Longitude: 22º 35’  
Time Zone: GMT +2 

Metsi  a  Mangwe  is  a  small  village  in  eastern  Botswana  in  the  Kweneng  district,  about 
100 km northwest of Molepolole. There are 400 households, each comprised of several 
rondavels,  that  make  up  the  family  compound. 
In  the  village,  there  are  four  primary 
schools  and  one  Junior  Secondary  School.  At  the  end  of  Junior  Secondary  School, 
students  take  the  Junior  Certificate  Exam,  and  if  they  pass,  they  can  attend  Senior 
Secondary School, usually in Molepolole, which is the capitol of the Kweneng district. 

The land surrounding Metsi a Mangwe is primarily divided into ―the lands‖ where women 
grow maize,  sorghum,  beans  and melons,  and  small  cattle  posts, where  the men  keep 
the  cattle.  Most  families  in  Kweneng  have  three  homes—one  in  the  village,  one  at  the 
lands and one at the cattle post.  The  landscape  is primarily desert scrub.  At the  lands, 
they  practice  rain-fed  agriculture  as  there  is  no  irrigation,  but  in  the  eastern  part  of  the 
country  there  is usually enough  rain during  the  rainy season  (November  – March) for at 
least part of the crop to be successful.  Farther from the village, most of the land is tribal 
grazing  land  without  clear  ownership;  young  boys  usually  keep  track  of  the  herds  and 
bring them back to their cattle posts when necessary.  Livestock is a  very important part 
of Setwana culture and is a measure of wealth.  There are three times as many cattle as 
people  and  twice  as  many  goats  as  cattle.  The  cattle  are  primarily  kept  at  the  cattle 
posts,  where  they  are  allowed  to  freely  roam  and  graze;  the  goats  are  dispersed 
throughout the cattle posts and the village. 

There is a small river that along the eastern side of  the  village,  it is a seasonal river that 
runs only  for about  five months of  the year.  People within easy walking distance of  the 
river  use  it  as  a  source  of  water  for  their  household  needs;  otherwise,  water  in  the 
village  is  provided  through  five  government-installed  boreholes  that  reach  into  a  water 
table  approximately  sixty  meters  below  the  surface.  Each  borehole  has  a  single  tap, 
which  serves  about  eighty  families.  Some  compounds  are  more  than  two  kilometers 
from  the  closest  tap.  There  is  also  a  borehole  at  the  Junior  Secondary  School,  which 
provides  water  for  the  teachers’  quarters  and  the  school  garden.  Farther  from  the 
village,  some  of  the  wealthier  members  of  the  village  have  installed  wind -powered 

pumps  to  supply  their  cattle  with  water.  The  seasonal  rains,  if  they  come,  arrive  in 
November  and  fall  sporadically  until  mid-March. 
If  the  rains  are  good,  the  desert 
becomes a grassland; if not, only the acacia shrubs are green. During the rainy season, 
water  accumulates  in  large  puddles  called pans;  these often  last a  few months  into  the 
dry season, but  rarely until  the beginning of  the next  rainy season.  When  the  rains are 
especially  heavy,  the  roads  become  impassable  and  take  up  to  a  week  to  dry  out,  but 
there are alternative  routes, so  the village  is not completely cut off.  The village  is  about 
100  km  from  Molepolole  on  a  road  where  the  first  half  is  paved  and  the  rest  is  a  well-
traveled  but  poorly  maintained  track.  Transport  of  supplies  into  the  village  can  be 
expensive,  depending  on  the  time  of  year,  as  only  the most  rugged  items  and  vehicles 
survive the journey intact. 

Apart from teachers and civil servants, few people in th is area have formal employment: 
some make crafts, a couple of people have small stores or bars that sell necessities and 
serve  as  a  social  gathering  place.  There  are  a  few  skilled  craftsmen—a metal worker, 
two  carpenters  and  a  mason—who  are  self-employed  and  make  a  good  living  for 
themselves.  Religion  is  important  in  Metsi  a  Mangwe:  there  are  several  different 
denominations, but only three churches have their own buildings.  Many of the churches 
conduct  services  at  the  compound  of  one  of  the  members  of  the  congregation.  There 
are  a  few  extension  agents  and  government  officers who  work  in Metsi  a Mangwe,  but 
the  district  headquarters  are  in  Molepolole  and  most  services  are  provided  by  these 
offices,  as  they  are  relatively  close.  There  is  a  post  office  and  most  people  who  have 
savings invest it in the Post Bank as there are no bank branches in the village. 

When  considering  a  water  system  for  this  community,  it  is  important  to  consider  the 
capital  resources  of  the  community.  Livestock  is  the  traditional measure  of wealth  and 
most people would  rather  invest  in  a  cow  than  a bank.  As  such,  cash  is  only available 
in  small  quantities and  saving  and  investment  in money  is  uncommon.  Bank  loans are 
available  at  a  15%  interest  rate,  though  few  people  apply  for  them.  Typically,  if  one 
wants  to  buy something of  high  value,  the  first  step  to  buying  it  is  to  sell a  cow or goat. 
The  Botswana  Meat  Commission  provides  a  high  price  for  livestock  as  part  of  a 
European  Union  aid  package,  though  transport  to  the  abattoir  takes  about  10%  of  the 
profits.  The  government  has  recently  started  a  program  where  villages  can  apply  for 
grants of up  to P 200,000  (the unit of currency  is  the  pula, which  is Setswana for  ―rain‖) 
to augment their water systems.  It costs P 25,000 to drill a borehole and install a tap.  It 
costs  an  average  of  P 50  per meter  to  install  a  pipeline  to  distribute water  from  the  tap 
to  the  surrounding  area. 
In  general,  additional  requirements  can  be  approximated  at 
30% higher than prices in South Africa. 

Water Development Committee 
Fall 2009 

The following are some members of  the community that you have met and may choose 
to  have  on  your  Water  Development  Committee.  Your  first  job  is  to  select  the 
committee.  As  a  group,  decide  who  you  will  invite  to  be  on  the  committee.  Once  you 
have  selected  the  committee,  each  of  you  will  be  responsible  for  learning  and  playing 
the  role of  one  of  the members:  studying  your  role,  preparing  the Role Play Worksheet 
to  develop  your  understanding  of  the  role,  and  playing  it  in  character  during  the 
negotiations during the next class.  One of you will be  the D-Lab student who  is helping 
the village apply  for  the government funding for  the project;  the  rest of  the group will be 
the other people who make up the committee. 

Metheo Borolong  is  the  chief  of  the  village.  He was  born  in Metsi  a Mangwe  but was 
educated  at  a  government  school  in  Molepolole,  followed  by  private  school  in 
Gaborone.  He has not attended university but values education and has advocated  for 
the  construction  of  two  primary  schools  and  a  junior  secondary  school  in  the  village. 
Fifteen years ago, he took over responsibility as chief from his uncle.  Despite taking on 
the  role  at  the  young  age  of  thirty-seven,  he  has  earned  the  respect  of  the  villagers 
through  the  programs  that  he  has  brought  to  the  village.  He  is  wealthy  by  Botswana 
standards—owning  120  cattle  and  200  goats,  as  well  as  a  new  Toyota  Hi-Lux  pick-up 
truck. 

Boitumelo Borolong  is  the chief’s wife. She lives with her husband and seven children 
in  the  chief’s  compound,  which  is  in  the  center  of  the  village.  She  attended  primary 
school  in  Metsi  a  Mangwe  and  junior  secondary  school  in  Molepolo le.  She  is  on  the 
board of the junior secondary school and is very active in the community. 

George  Nyamagure  is  the  headmaster  of  the  local  Junior  Secondary  School.  He  is 
one  of  the  few  people  in  Metsi  a  Mangwe  to  attend  the  University  of  Botswana  in 
Gaborone,  where  he  studied  education  and  literature.  He  lives  on  the  school  campus 
with his wife, four children and his elderly mother.  He  has a  reputation among students 
of  being  very  strict  but  fair,  and  everyone  who  graduates  from  his  school  remembers 
him fondly as an excellent teacher and administrator. 

Peter  Kalanga  runs  a  small  metal-working  shop  on  the  edge  of  the  village.  He  is  a 
Zimbabwean  refugee,  who  moved  to  Botswana  with  his  family  during  the  instability  in 
the  early  80’s.  He  is  well-educated  and  speaks  excellent  English;  his  workshop  is 
known  for  its  high  quality work.  Every  few  years,  he hires  students who  graduate  from 
the junior secondary school to serve as apprentices in the shop.  In addition to the metal 
shop,  he  owns  a  small  general  store  in  the  front  of  his  compound  which  is  run  by  his 
oldest  daughter.  He  gets  his  supplies  for  the  shop  from  Gaborone  and  Molepolole, 
which arrive on a weekly delivery truck. 

Agnes Modimo  is  the  leader of the women’s group  in Metsi a Mangwe.  She  is married 
to  the  pastor  of  the  United  Church  of  Christ,  which  is  the  largest  church  in  the  village. 
She  was  born  in  Francistown  and  moved  to  Metsi  a  Mangwe  to  be  with  her  husband 
forty years ago.  She founded the women’s group twenty-five years ago and has been a 
dynamic  leader  of  the  group,  which  now  has  over  seventy  members.  She  is  a 
proponent of women’s rights, but still holds strongly to he r traditional beliefs, though she 
is  more  progressive  than  many  of  the  other  women  her  age.  She  attended  senior 
secondary  school  at  a  time  when  few  girls  continued  their  education  to  this  level;  she 
was the top student at her school, but did not go to university. 

Gabriel Modimo is the pastor of the United Church of Christ, the largest church in Metsi 
a Mangwe.  He  is one of  the most highly  respected elders  in  the  village.  He was born 
and  raised  in Metsi  a Mangwe  and  has  spent  his whole  life  there  with  the  exception  of 
two  years  at  the  seminary. 
In  addition  to  dynamic  preaching,  he  is  known  for  his 
pastoral outreach and concern for the members of his congregation.  He supports many 
projects that help his parishioners including a sewing school and a day care that are run 
in the church building during the week. 

Brett  Anderson  is  a  Peace  Corps  Volunteer  from  rural  Montana.  He  went  to  a  large 
state  school  and  studied  accounting  before  deciding  that  he  wanted  to  have  a  better 
understanding  of  other  parts  of  the  world  and  make  contributions  wherever  he  could. 
He  arrived  in  Botswana  three  months  ago,  and  the  Metsi  a  Mangwe  area  will  be  his 
home  for  the  next  two  years.  His  family  grew  corn  and  wheat  in  Montana  and  Brett 
wants  to  work  in  agricultural  management  when  he  returns  to  the  United  States. 
Although  he  comes  from  a  very  isolated  area  and  has  had  limited  exposure  to  other 
cultures, most people have  really taken  to Brett because of his curiosity and willingness 
to  ask  questions  and  experience  village  life  first-hand.  He  was  in  the  advanced 
Setswana  group  during  his  Peace  Corps  training  and  has  a  knack  for  learning  new 
languages. 
In  addition  to  his  primary  assignment  to  promote  village  horticulture 
projects, he is looking for secondary projects to work on. 

Mpho  Temothuo  is  the  agriculture  teacher  at  the  junior  secondary  school.  He  speaks 
excellent  English  and  is  a  charismatic  young  man  who  is  well -liked  throughout  the 
community.  He  lives  in  school  housing  with  his  wife  and  three  small  children.  He 
attended  Botswana  Agricultural  College  where  he  specialized  in  horticulture  and 
beekeeping.  He  was  born  near  Francistown  (Botswana’s  second  largest  city )  but 
enjoys  the  village  life  in  Metsi  a  Mangwe.  He  is  a  favorite  teacher  at  the  school  due  to 
his  energy  and  enthusiasm.  The  school  garden  is  productive  and  sells  vegetables  to 
raise  money  for  equipment  for  the  school  football  (soccer)  and  netball  teams.  Each 
year,  his  students  earn  outstanding  marks  on  the  agriculture  practicals  for  the  Junior 
Certificate  exams.  He  is  friends with  the  agricultural  extension worker  that  is  stationed 
in Molepolole and  they are working  together  to  start a  community horticulture project  in 
the village. 

Mary Dintwa  is a nurse at  the clinic on  the edge of  town.  She often sees patients from 
Metsi  a  Mangwe  and  nearby  areas  who  are  ill  from  water-borne  diseases  but  many 
times  cannot  give  any  treatment  beyond  recommendations  for  better  water  practices 
because medicine  is short in supply and very expensive for the villagers.  She wa s born 
in  the  Tsabong  district  of  Botswana,  in  the  southwest,  but  traveled  a  lot  within  the 
country  as  a  young  girl  and  speaks  several  of  the  local  languages.  However,  her 
English  is  not  very  good  and  she  prefers  to  communicate  through  other  people  rather 
than to make an attempt with her limited skills. 

Per Vand  is a Danish volunteer who works  for Water  for Humanity.  He spent six years 
installing  village  water  systems  in  Cambodia  and  three  years  installing  systems  in 
Rwanda before coming  to Botswana six months ago.  He  is on a  five-year contract with 
the  Danish  government  to  assist  with  implementing  the  new  village  water  system 
augmentation program and  is  the  representative  for  the Kweneng district.  He  lives  in a 
government-issue house on the outskirts of Molepolole on the road that leads to Metsi a 
Mangwe. 

Kabelo  Mothibi  is  a  long-time  Department  of  Water  and  Sanitation  worker  with  the 
national government of Botswana.  He grew up  in Gaborone and  keeps his office  there 
but  visits  the  rural districts  throughout  the  year  to  check on any  infrastructure problems 
and  to  train  local maintenance  crews,  where  applicable.  His  visits  are  eagerly  awaited 
because  they  bring  connections  to  the  resources  and  knowledge  available  at  the 
national  level.  He  started  university  with  a  specialization  in  biology  but  was  forced  to 
withdraw  because  his  academic  performance  was  not  strong  enough  to  maintain  his 
scholarship.
