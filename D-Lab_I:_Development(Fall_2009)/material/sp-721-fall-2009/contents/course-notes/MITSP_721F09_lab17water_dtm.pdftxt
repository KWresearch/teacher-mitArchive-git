Steps to membrane filtration using the Test Water Cheap design. 

Preparation: 
1.	 Pour a small amount of alcoho l (isopropenol)  into a shallow dish or plate, deep enough to 
submerge the washers and metal mesh.  (This will need to be replenished occasionally if 
testing for a long period of time, since the alcoho l will evaporate.  Replenish when the flame 
on the washers dipped  in alcoho l does not cover the ent ire washer.) 
2.	 Light a candle, which is the easiest flame source for this method since things need to be 
sterilized often.  (Note: when ho lding things over the flame to sterilize them, ho ld them 
above (not  in) the visible part of the flame.  This will prevent soot from covering the 
equipment and thus the filter paper.  If soot does accumulate, you can wipe the parts with a 
paper towel.) 
3.	 If available, set up a ring stand to hold the baby bottle upside down. 
4.	 Attach one end of the rubber tubing to a luer  lock, which attaches to the syringe.  Slide the 
screw-on lid onto the other end and attach the spout. 

5.	 Wipe the spout, the inside of the screw-on lid, and the top rim and threads of the bottle with 
alcoho l to clean/sterilize them before starting. 
6.	 Prepare a Petri-dish (this may be done a few at a time): 

•	 Using a thin permanent marker,  label the bottom of the dish (the side that fits inside the 
other half o f the dish) with your init ials, the date, the sample ident ification, vo lume of 
water tested, and any other  informat ion needed to dist inguish the tests from each other. 

•	 Turn the dish right side up and open it (with sterile hands).  Squirt 2-ml o f testing broth 
onto the absorbent pad (which should be laying on top of the labeled side).  Avo id 
squirt ing the very last bit of broth, which will dispense bubbles.  Be sure to cover the 
ent ire pad with broth.  If there is a large amount of excess broth at the bottom of the dish, 
carefully pour it out, making sure to leave one large drop of broth in the bottom.  Close 
the Petri-dish. 

Testing: 
1.	 Rub hands with anti-bacterial hand sanit izer. 
2.	 Remove a sterile insert from the box of inserts without touching the inside or top rim.  Drop 
the insert  into the rigid plast ic bottle/ho lder. 
3.	 Pour at  least 75 ml o f the water sample (or a dilut ion) into the disposable insert. 

4.	 With tweezers, dip the metal washer  into alcoho l and ho ld  it over a flame unt il the alcoho l 
catches on fire.  Wait  for the all the alcoho l to burn off (some liquid may be left on the 
washer, as isopropenol is usually diluted with water), making sure to hold the flaming washer 
over an inflammable surface, as flaming alcoho l somet imes drips off the washer.  (The 
washers and mesh may be placed to rest in the alcoho l during testing to prevent them from 
being  laid on a dirty surface.) 
5.	 Place the metal washer on top of the disposable insert, using tweezers. 
6.	 Rub hands with anti-bacterial hand sanit izer (be sure to do this at  least once per test, 
perferably before openning the filter paper package). 
7.	 Open a filter paper package by pulling back the tabs (uncovering about half of the filter 
paper), folding them over, and holding them against the package without touching the filter 
paper or the blue paper(s) protecting the filter paper.  (Once you have touched the inside of 
the package flaps, do not  let them flip back and touch the papers inside the package.) 
8.	 Sterilize tweezer tips (as in step 4). 
9.	 Slide the filter paper out of its package with the tweezers and place it grid-side down on top 
of the metal washer.  Center the filter paper as much as possible. 

10. Sterilize the metal mesh by dipping  in alcohol and flaming.


11. Place the mesh on top of the filter paper.  Center the mesh as much as possible (use 2 
sterile tweezers if necessary).  The better the mesh is centered, the better the lid will seal. 

12. Sterilize the rubber washer by dipping  in alcoho l and flaming. 
13. Place (and center) the rubber washer on top of the mesh. 

14. Place the spout and screw-on lid on top of the rubber washer and screw the lid tight to 
seal the elements. 
15. Invert the baby bottle and hang  it on a ring stand,  if available. 
16. Vacuum-pull the water out with the syringe unt il all the water is gone (until no water can 
be visually seen  rolling around on top of the filter paper).  Try to avoid completely 
collapsing the disposable insert onto the filter paper. 

17. If most ly air comes through when you pull with the syringe, try turning the baby bottle 
upright and carefully unscrewing and rescrewing the top.  If this does not work, unscrew 
the top and try to re-center all four elements on top of the baby bottle with 2 sterile 
tweezers.  Try to lose as litt le water as possible during these adjustments.  If these steps 
continue to not fix the problem, you may need to trim the mesh to a smaller size.  Do this 
with sharp scissors and ensure that the edges are flat afterwards, not sticking up (which 
generally occurs with dull scissors). 
18. When all the water has passed through the filter paper, turn the bottle upright, unscrew 
the top, and carefully remove the spout, making sure that the filter paper and mesh 
(which will st ick together) stay on top of the baby bottle and do not fall o ff. 
19. Open a Petri dish so that the filter paper may be placed  inside it. 
20. With sterile tweezers, remove the filter paper (you may need to grab the mesh with one 
pair of tweezers and remove the filter paper from it with another pair).  Place (and 
carefully center) the paper grid-side up  into the bottom of the Petri-dish with a rolling 

mot ion (to avoid trapping bubbles o f air underneath).  Make sure that the paper is lying 
completely flat  in the dish.  If one edge of it  is up on the side of the Petri-dish, carefully 
adjust  it with sterile tweezers, but touch only the edge of the filter paper.  Close the Petri 
dish. 
21. Repeat steps 1-20 for each sample.	 (Do not reuse the drop-in inserts unless the first test 
was a “blank test.”) 
22. At  least every 20 minutes, stack the completed Petri dishes (making sure they all face the 
same direct ion) and strap them together with tape.  Place them upside down  in the 
prepared incubator (labeled side up).  (This way, when condensation drips down, it 
doesn’t smear co lonies.) 
23. Remove them after the specified amount of time (24 hours if using mCo liBlue-24 broth) 
and count the number of colonies. 
24.	 Dispose incubated and counted Petri-dishes by squirting a 10% chlorine so lut ion (you 
can dilute Chlorox bleach)  into the Petri dish, replacing the cover, and throwing  in the 
disposal pail.
