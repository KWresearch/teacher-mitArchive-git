The Need for Evaluation

	 50 years of global aid. $65 billion per 
annum. But too little change. 

Surprisingly little hard evidence on 
best policies for addressing the 
needs of the poor. 

Sometimes conventional wisdom 
needs to be rethought. 
Example: Best buy for primary school

attendance.

In-School Deworming


� Many reasons for children not to be in schools
but addressing their health can be a cheap,
effective and easy way to improve attendance.

� 400 million children infected with intestinal
worms, causing them to be anemic and tired.

� Sick children skip school more often.

� School-based mass deworming costs 50 cents per
child per year and increases attendance by 1/6 of 
a school year (about 30 days annually).

� Kenya launched national deworming program to 
treat 3.6 million children.

Incentives to Immunize


Vaccines are highly cost effective and provided
for free in many countries.

Yet  there are still areas with very low coverage.

Small incentives (e.g. a bag of lentils for each
shot) can dramatically increase uptake.

By encouraging many more families to attend
immunization clinics or camps, incentives can
reduce the cost per child immunized.

Smart Incentives


Simple agriculture technologies have potential to 
dramatically increase income.

Surprisingly low use even when farmers know the
benefits.

Smart subsidies can trigger big changes at low

Limited-time offers at harvest time can be more
effective than big subsidies at planting time.

Free Bednets


Large social benefits from use of insecticide
treated bednets. WHO advocates free bednets.

Proponents of user fees suggest charging helps
ensure bednets get to those who need them and
will use them.

Evidence shows it simply excludes the poor and
does not promote usage.

Coverage drop by 75% with small user fees.

90% of free or bought bednets are used.

$200-300 per child life saved.

ITN cost $5.
