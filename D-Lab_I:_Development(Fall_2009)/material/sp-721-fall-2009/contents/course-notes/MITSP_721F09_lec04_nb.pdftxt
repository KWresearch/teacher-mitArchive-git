...continuing conversation on theory of development 

Came into question during mid 1960s 
- economic growth of countries starts to slow down 
- people start asking questions of relation of economic model 
- stages of growth theories not applying to countries 
- lots of urbanization happening faster than industrialization 
- many people going to service jobs 
{skipping over labor phases 
		was	originally	thought	had	to	go	through	labor	first}

VIEW 1 
Gov’t intervention disrupts market 
- How exchange rate gets set 
encouraged capital intensive investments 
discouraged labor intensive investments 
paying too much for labor 
discouraged hiring of labor 
- Interviend wrongly in agriculture 
gov’t tried to set price to feed urban 
@ a price that discourages farmer’s to grow 
- Why intervene? 

VIEW 2

Gov’t controlled by Elite (neo-colonialist)

	 
{more	interested	in	global	world	and	making	more	money} 
- Not re-investing money into country 

Use of technology an important issue in development 
- people need a productive role 
- meaningful + socially engaging 
- give people the technology that 
they can build upon themselves 

Small is Beautiful 
- arguing against bigness as solution 
- arguing against large scaled economies

HOW YOU DO THINGS MATTERS

- organization setting

- more than technology you are using 
- dissemination requires understanding
 of organization 
{mechanism for delivery 
material acquisition 
marketing 

APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY 
What makes something appropriate? 
Need 
Cheap 
Understood/Understandable 
Matches Skills 
Locally Produced 
Matches Local Environment 
Culuturally Acceptable 
Applicability 
Reliable/Repairable/Maintainable 
Beneficial 
Environmentally Friendly 
Provides Meaningful work 
Increased Production 
Quality 

	 

Definition	has	changed	over	time... 
- locally available materials to material able to be 
obtained locally IE plastic sachets in rural village 
- ownership of ideas
 patents & royalties 

Loaded Question 
Extended debate 
to be had in

Women who were widows (outcast) 
- can now have an income 
- limiting factor of production 
is workshop location (transportation) 

- Figuring out how to make this work is
 dependent on understanding of organization 
- Focus on more than technology 

- Gadgets don’t always turn into
 income generators for target audience 

Shoemaker (S is B) 
- Economics as if people mattered.HUMAN SCALE 

EXAMPLES OF APPRO TECH 
Sari Cloth Filter 
Can make a huge difference 
in cholera outbreak 

Pot In Pot 

Whirlwind Wheelchairs 
- A complex technology being made locally 
- End users producing product 
- Appropriate technology can be simple and good 

Light Up the World: 
Solid State Lights 
- Circuit board not produced locally 
- Housing made locally 

Grameen Phone 
- If you can put in the network/infrastructure
 people can have access to technology 
- Supply chains are more
 important than the device 

“Understanding what is appropriate 
is the crux of the movement.” 

Bias against market when there was low growth 

Market - a powerful mechanism for 
disciplining yourself in design 
- one set of mistakes made in
 early days of appro tech was
 not asking practical questions 
- ask practical questions!! 
{																				} 
Understand how market works 
Turn it into force that works in your favor. 
- not necessary to de-link yourself
 from gov’t + politics + market 

Doing things collectively has a sense
 of being morally good 
The	organization	of	those	people	can	be	difficult 

Understanding the market 
			-	How	do	big	firms	work	on	the	ground
 - Use their structure to your advantage 
			-	Ask	questions	+	find	out	links 

Community
 - We think it is independent of market + state
 - The are linked though 

EFFICIENCY 
As idea that you get the maximum out of your investment 
- Example of drinking tea from 3 - 4 taking away
  time later on. Culturally appropriate maybe, but
 maybe not for the situation. THEY (the poor) 
need the time. 
- Grameen Bank 
ritual of singing to weed out people 
who don’t really need the loan 

WHY? are people doing what they are doing? 
HOW? can I build on it? 

Simplify to basic two or three steps. 

ASK of your host organization If there was one thing 
	 
to	change,	to	make	it	more	efficient,	what	would	it	 
be? 

- Trying to do 10 million things
 at one time is overwhelming 
- Decide out of 10 things, which
 one will make the most impact 
- Just because the situation is a 
result of an intersection of multiple
 aspects, doesn’t mean the solution
 must be. 

Focus on 
One Thing
