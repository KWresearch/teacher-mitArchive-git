Historical genesis 

IMF: 
Great depression 
Countries took individual actions to protect themselves 
Increase in trade barriers 
Collapse of international trade, everyone worse off 
Rise of Hitler 
Determination to avoid mistakes of the past 

World Bank: 
Post WWII, massive investment needs in Europe 
Europe had no money and difficult to borrow 
Bank willing to take the long-term view on the investment 
The world would benefit from European prosperity 
(avoiding the mistakes of post WWI history and rise of Hitler) 

IMF Objectives
 

Article 1: 

i) promote cooperation 

ii) increase trade, and therefore employment and income 

iii) stable exchange rates (initially mainly fixed exchange rates) 
avoid competitive devaluation 

iv) reduce restrictions on payments for trade 

v) provide loans to help cover shortfalls in Balance of Payments 
to help correct BoP without hurting national or international interests 

vi) therefore reduce the impact of BoP/foreign exchange crises 

Macroeconomics 101: a series of definitions and budget constraints 

Real sector (definition) 

GDP = Cp + Cg +Ip + Ig + X – M 

(S-I)p + (S-I)g = X - M 

Private balance  Govt balance  Trade balance 

Balance of payments  (budget constraint) 

Exports – imports + FI&T + capital inflows – outflows = Δ reserves
 

Trade account 

Capital account 

Fiscal sector: (budget constraint) 

Taxes – expenditure =  govt balance = - financing 

Financing = CB financing + bank financing + privatization + new bonds + external
 

M 
onetary sector: (reasonably

predictable relationship) 

MV=PY 

IMF conditions
 

How does IMF and WB lending impact these constraints?
 

Exports – imports + FI&T + capital inflows – outflows = Δ reserves 

IMF money 

(S-I)p + (S-I)g = X - M 

Can be bigger 

Fiscal deficit = borrowing from banks + new bonds +donor money
 

Can be bigger	 

Less bank borrowing means 
less inflation 

World bank 
money 

How does IMF and World Bank lending fit into this picture? 

IMF lending 

The deal: we will work with you to figure out the constraints. If you fit within them we will 
give you some additional money to ease the constraints (allow a bigger fiscal deficit or more
 
imports or both).
 

Short-term lending: failure of export crop would require sharp cut in imports could do long
 
term damage. Short term loan allows you to keep importing and avoid the damage.
 

Long-term lending: gives breathing space to improve policies that lead to long term grow.
 

World Bank Lending
 

The deal: there are investments countries can make with up front costs and long-run payoffs. 
We will lend you the money and give technical advice on the investments and you can pay us 
back out of the long-term benefits. 

Project lending—building roads costs money but it helps generate higher output 

Program lending—cutting tariffs reduces government revenue (and jobs) up front but helps 
stimulate growth. Loan will cover lost revenue and help pay for support to those made 
unemployed.
