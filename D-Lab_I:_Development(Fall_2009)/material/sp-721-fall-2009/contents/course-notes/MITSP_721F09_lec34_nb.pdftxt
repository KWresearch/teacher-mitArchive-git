Market Approaches to Development 
Paul Polak (founder of IDE)
The only way to get people out of poverty, is if 
everyone in the supply chain makes a profit. This way, the system 
is self sustaining, not dependent on outside funding. 

3 Poverty Eradication Myths 
1. We can donate people out of poverty 
There are situations where donations 
make sense (natural disaster) 
But a sustainable model supports itself 
2. We can end poverty through national economic growth 
A trickle down effect of money… hasn’t happened 
3. Multinationals as they are now will end poverty 
As they are now, that won’t end poverty 
P&G making sachets of soap, in and of itself, 
won’t make a difference, more is required 
Big lesson, is that it is about
supply chains and profit margins
If someone has to pay more than they can earn, 
the technology won’t fly 

Increase people’s income to bring them out of poverty 
What are ways for people to make more income? 
Interesting to look at what people spend their money on, 
freedom to choose what they want 

Example of Treadle Pump
Technology is adapted to local area (sold 
without steps in someplaces, where people make steps 
themselves) 
Marketing aspects of the Treadle Pump 

Bollywood Movies 
Less money to make a movie than 
to do a “social marketing” 
For a long time, Paul got a lot of criticism 
for this approach. In the end though, he has had an 
incredible impact on the market 
Understanding the way a person can afford
things, effects their ability to afford it. 
IE car dealers often have financing options 
Need to understand the market, and the buyers 
(income/habits/etc) 

Paul Polak’s  Don’t Bother Trilogy 
- If you haven’t talked to 25 poor people 
before you start… 
- If it won’t pay for itself in the first year… 
- If you can’t sell at least a million of them… 

What do people spend their additional income on? 
TOP 3: Food, Ag Production, Education 

Value is getting added, but how is it being extracted?
