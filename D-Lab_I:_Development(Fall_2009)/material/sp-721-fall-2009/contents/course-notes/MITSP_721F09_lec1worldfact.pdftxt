This exercise serves as an engaging introduction to a class on international development and/or 
appropriate technology. It brings issues to the students’ attention in an extremely interactive way 
and allows you to focus on topics or technologies of particular interest to your class. 

The order in which you present the answers can be very important, especially when there is a 
list of data from several countries, as the stark contrasts between countries can increase the 
impact of the information presented. 

I usually follow the quiz with a brief description of some technologies that address the problems 
that are highlighted by the quiz: the sari cloth water filter, the pot-in-pot evaporative cooling 
system, the Light Up The World Foundation solid-state lights, and the Grameen phone. These 
examples also show the range of what is considered to be “appropriate” in today’s context. 

A good follow-up reading is the New York Times article Kof i Annan’s Astonishing Facts, by 
Barbara Crosette (September 27, 1998). 

Unless otherwise indicated, the quiz uses data from the World Development Indicators by the 
World Bank. Refer to the most recent version of this document in order to update the answers 
for your class. The quiz and answers for 2009 can be found in the Introduction presentation 
slides.
