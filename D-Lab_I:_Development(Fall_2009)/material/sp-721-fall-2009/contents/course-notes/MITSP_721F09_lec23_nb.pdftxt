Micro Enteprise w/ Bish 
If you are interested in any of htis, let me know. 
Because I can go into more detail outside of class (Bish) 

3 TYPE OF ASSISTANCE
 1. Supply Side
 2. Increase Demand for Product (not so common) 
IE ask gov’t to buy from vendors
   gov’t needs receipt/difficult w/ informal sector
 3. Empowerment 
- a lot of talk about this 
- multiple definitions 
- assumptions of empowerment... (later in notes) 

SUPPLY SIDE
 - Give Credit
 - ME (Micro Enterprise) 
train owners + workers 
IE help to make more w/ market
 - Create Technologies [D-Lab] 

Won’t go into detail about the following options:
 - Trade Organizations + Co-operatives
 - Improve working conditions 
IE giving them gloves 
repeal gov’t regulations for people 
working in the informal sector 
Street Vending > Police Harrassment > Bribe 
Making street vending legal reduces this cost 

GOOD RESEARCH: 
When policy was made, what were the assumptions 
use this assessment to inform new policy 

Provision of Credit
 Reluctance to Provide Credit 
1. High Default Risk 
Muhammed Yunus changed this 
assumption completely 

2. ? 
3. Prejudice against women 
“business is what men do” 
assumptions proven wrong 

There is bias towards people 
saving in a way that you don’t 
4. Inability to meet bureaucratic procedures 
5. Existing Loan repayment system not
 convenient for MEs 
don’t have fixed income (unpredicatable) 

- higher interest rate 
- money lenders set the price for the money 
- money lenders charge the market rate
 “what people are willing to pay” 

Lessons Learned 
Credit to Yunus 
proving poor is not high risk group 
“poor” is not a homogenous group 
identifying good candidates 
Created Structure in which communities decides 

ULTIMATELY AFTER INFORMATION 

Social pressure by peer group to pay back loan. 
- people meet everyday 
  (have to live close by, doesn’t work in Arkansas) 
- a monitoring social network 
connect to other people 
share issuses other than the loan 
Leasons Learned about Credit Delivery
2 Types 
- Short Term (crisis)(loan shark type) 
important to get short term elements right 
or else people will stick with loan shark 
- Long Term (renegotiable) 

Poor peopel are more concerned with ACCESS to the loan than 
with the INTEREST RATE 
- Grameen charges 32% 
- If interest rate is too low, you attract
 the wrong target qudience 
- make unattractive to middle class 
people who don’t have time for daily rituals 
- solidarity group helps to define the ritual
 what does the community say 

Does it have to be multifacted (credit +)? 
IE giving business advice too 
DO ONE THING WELL, and then expand, after learning
 what makes sense 
How will it scale over time/space (to the next village)

 Most institutions created to provide credit,
 have yet to become self sufficient 
- have to save/invest money too 
[this hasn’t been figured out yet] 
- Grameen -> started to move to housing 
- Need savings to create a sustainable solution 

To ensure lending to large #’s 
big institutions have to get involved 
- they have the infrastructure to be efficient 
- credit guarantee scheme 
{bank of holland example} 

Don’t treat money lenders as bad guys 
- they have info (of different types) that
 the poor trust. A source and symbol. 
- poor won’t cut off all previous ties to
 be part of new structure (microfinance) 

KEY ASSUMPTIONS 
Training and Technical Assistance

 - lack of tech knowledge
 - lack managerial + business skills
 - women need to be liberated from household work
 ____________________________ 

Skills are not FIRM specific 
- learning new skills doesn’t create labor mobility 
- here in the “west” people learn skills then
 move to a new job 
- the poor are able to do the same 

Lessons Learned 
- MEs are very responsive to market fluctuation 
- in ways we can’t imagine 
- it takes a lot to be flexible 
- Success doesn’t need new skills 
ACCESS to new markets for old skills 
- different demand than asking person
 to learn a new skill 
- No guarantee for a new market w/ new skill 
There should be a clear benefit for skill 
training program should reimburse the person 
“If it is not a problem that
they will face on the day
to day then it will not stick.” 
Learning on the job, not a training course 

People take skills, then move to a new job, move to city 
“people want to be in a place that is thriving” 
Why should poor be any different then 
everyone else around the world? 

Teach entrepreneurship... what does that mean? 

Ask: Why hasn’t cheap technologies not come yet? 
b/c large scale firms don’t cater to the market? 

cheaper than other options 
how much vs their income though 
how much... do they really make
 can they pay/afford 

Tech for ACCESS to new markets are appealing 
cleaners wanting gloves vs. new broom dust pan
 - reduce health hazard, people see the benefit 

Seeds Spread
Quickly
