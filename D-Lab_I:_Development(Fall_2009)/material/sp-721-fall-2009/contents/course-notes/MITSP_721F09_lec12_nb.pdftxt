Direct Method - burn material we are CARBONIZING 

Experiments with waste heat 

Gassification requires more complex materials/devices 
55 gal. oil drum is very cheap/simple

Charcoal History
Discovering the idea 
Haiti 
Using waste (paper then agriculture)

 Forming briquettes by hand 
- fell aprt when burned
 Figuring out best way to form: COMPACTION
 Field Test -> Haiti 
- then tried in Pakistan (banana leaves) 
- Ghana (corn cobs)

 Water Soluable Binder 
- Sand to stop burning 
- Trust community partner knowledge + familiarity

 Traditional Charcoal - bad for environment 
x chopping tree 
x sterilize ground 
x seal ground 
- no regrowth
 Chemicals are being released 
INDOOR or OUTDOOR 
Better to release outside not in home 
“cleaner” than wood charcoal (or dung) in house

 3 Things that are required: 
1. biomass 
2. drive off volatiles (high temp) 
3. control oxygen (elminate oxygen)
