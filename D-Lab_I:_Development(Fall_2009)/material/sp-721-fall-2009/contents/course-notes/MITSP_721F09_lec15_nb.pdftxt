- Wind Belt @ 1 Meter scale starts to effect
 performance 
- aluminum @ 1m can ... tweak (?) 
-Vorticy shedding not main part of system 
power capturing 
- Expected to have about 25 year life
 with current materials

 1. Know your resource 
- How much power is available in a given area 
- commercial viability - Standard of reality 
- solar example of current room

 SMALL SCALE 
energy is what matters, not power (electricity) 

Spinning Airfoil 
Gearbox
Spinning copper coil 

 Typical Wind Power 

Tacoma Narrows Bridge 

Windcell w/o Gears 
go where wind + solar can’t go 
- result of design challenge of wind energy in Haiti 
- maybe 10-15 windcells could power your house

Introduction to Microhydro 
(sub 100kw electric system) 

-How it Works 
“Borrow” flow of river to produce energy 

Most complext part: Load Controller 
- consider low and peak usage 
- electrical power is mechanical load on turbine 
Dump Load 
-> 
Light/Heat 
(excess load) 
AC or DC Choice - depend on the size of system 
Sub 500W - DC 
AC advantage: larger transmission length 

-Remember one formula to calculate the power of system 
Head x Flow X Gravity x Efficienty (assume 51%) = P 

- Balancing Safety vs. Cost 

- Distribution -> Professionals : Transformers
