The 3 development revolutions 
- AT 

- how do we create great rural workplaces to 
prevent rural-urban migration 
- Participatory D 
- Engage with the community to determine what
 the priorities are 
- Stakeholder analysis -> do not marginalize
 vulnerable populations 
- Co-creation 
-	These	influenced	D-Lab	 

	 

	 

STUDENT ACTIVITY 
“don’t mix the coffee with the diarrhea!” 

Didactic approach vs. participation
 { calculus vs. facilitation }
  Most D-Lab students have only didactic experience 
{advice 
always good
Arrange information in terms of 
most didactic to most participatory 
1. Coffee 
2. Diarrhea 
3. Water Pumps 

CLASS 
Diarrhea - more didactic approach 
Water - more participatory 
Sometimes a didactic approach is more effective for diarrhea 

Didactic Approach has assumptions built in about the 
efficiency	+	appropriateness	of	your	solution 
- the pump tool for example 

AMY 
One thing to take away from this class: 
“There is no one way to solve all problems” 
Don’t refuse to give information because it is not yet 
located in the community 

Facilitators of participatory exercises must be truly 
interested in what they are facilitating 

Participation has many examples in economics, politics, 
education, but not as much in technology 
- Many people do not believe that 
		beneficiaries	of	technology	should	co-create.

Nowadays we must ALWAYS be learning. How do we help people learn 
new things in creative ways. 

Lego Mindstorms were initially intended to be an invention toolkit. 
The Mindstorm would be used in ways they weren’t expected. 
- 13 year old girl in Thailand used the light sensor on 
  Lego Mindstorm to control an ultra-violet light that her
 family used to attract insects (for food). 

EDUCATION 
Traditionally	students	are	empty	vessel	that	teachers	fill	up 

Imagine 
Create 
Play 
Share 
Reflect 
New Ideas 

Development/Education/ 
Design Process 

The most important approach is the teaching method 
- not necessarily be technology 
- greater range of technology/material = greater possibility 

Build {structures, mechanism, behaviors} 

Why not have computer clubhouses in schools? 
- because during pilot after school programs it was the kids
  who were getting in trouble after school that wanted to
 work on the mindstorms 
- schools seem overcommited to the didactic approach 
		to	school.	Computer	clubhouses	give	more	flexibility	
 administratively.
