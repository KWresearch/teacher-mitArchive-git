Qualitative Needs Assessment
•D-Lab’s first trip to Ecuador! 

•We hope to: 
•Identify projects for both D-Lab and D-Lab Health 
•Through: 
•Group assessments 
•Individual interviews 

•Emphasis on par ticipator y survey 

•Both an asset-based and a needs-based assessment

Ensuring Reliable Water Sources 

Right Now in Ecuador : 
-In most areas: piped water is either unavailable or contaminated and 
unsafe 
- Not enough water available to support hydroponic systems 

To Do: 
- Design household rainwater collection and purification systems 
- Identify different levels of water needs and integration into their
