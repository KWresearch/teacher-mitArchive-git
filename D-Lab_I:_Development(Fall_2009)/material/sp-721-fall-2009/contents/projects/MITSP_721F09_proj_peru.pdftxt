Greenhouses (Amparaes) 

• Add crops with high nutritional value
• Built using locally available, affordable 
materials and skills
• Current concerns
• Communal vs. Family-owned
• Locally available fertilizer?
• De-assemb
• Government-provided plastic, or 
alternative source?
• Building over Thanksgiving break, 
come join if you like!

Efficient Cookstoves (Amazonas)

•Current Situation: Use wooden 
platforms with clay lining (open 
flame)
•Design Considerations: 
•Humid climate in the Amazon
•Families move every 5-6 years
•Large amounts of clay available
•Possible Solutions
•Portable clay stove design
•Insulative Combustion Chamber
•Alternatives: Concrete mixture 
or bricks
