Atsungiumajurniapaa, Nunavut 
Latitude: 67° 06' 07 North: Longitude: 87° 18' 09 West 
Time Zone: GMT-5 (1 hr behind EST) - 
 
Atsungiumajurniapaa,  Nunavut  is  a  remote  Inuit  Community  of  about  200  people 
located  just  above  the  Arctic  Circle  in  the  Canadian  North.  It  is  regionally  accessible 
only  by  airplane  and  sealift  and  only  for  the  summer  months  of  June  to  August.  After 
arriving  by  boat  or  plane  in Naujat  (Repulse  Bay),  one must  travel  100km  northeast  by 
snow-  or  dogsled  to  reach  the  community.  Naujat  is  the  closet  community  with  an 
independent electricity generating facility, and its grid is unavailable for extension.  
 
The  people  of  Atsungiumajurniapaa  live  traditionally.  They  hunt  seal,  narwhal  and 
caribou and herd  reindeer. These are  their main  source of  sustenance. The  community 
has  a  herd  of  about  60  reindeer,  which  is  actually  unusual  for  a  North-American  Arctic 
community. A quick-flowing  stream provides access  to  the bay  from  July  to August, but 
quickly  ices  off  at  the  beginning  of  October.  During  the  winter  months  pack-ice  makes 
traditional  sea  navigation  impossible  and  hunters  from  the  community  typically  hunt  for 
seal  at  their  airholes.  Moreover  since  their  village  is  located  above  the  Arctic  treeline, 
community members’ intake of vegetables is limited to some of the edible scrub bushes, 
grasses  and  tubers  that  grow  nearby  in  the  summer months  and  to  high-cost  imported 
vegetables from the South. Tomatoes, for example, can cost over $15 US per kg.  
 
The  environment  around  Atsungiumajurniapaa  is  true  arctic  tundra;  a  vast  plane  on 
three  sides and a protected bay on  the  fourth. Precipitation during  the  year  is  limited  to 
only 10-20 mm of snow and drizzle, however a strong breeze constantly whips up  loose 
snow  almost  year-round,  giving  the  illusion  that  it  is  always  snowing.  From  April  to 
September, Atsungiumajurniapaa can see up to 22 hours of daylight per day, while from 
December to March it may see only 2 hours per day. Typical temperatures range from 8 
to  10°C  (46  to  50°F)  in  the  summer  to  -40  to  -45°C  (-40  to  –49°F)  in  the winter.  These 
conditions should be considered when designing an appropriate energy program. 
 
Quilliq Power, a crown corporation  founded  to provide  independent generating capacity 
in  Nunavut,  has  expressed 
in 
facility 
in  opening  a  small  generating 
interest 
Atsungiumajurniapaa,  however  it  took  several  years  for  the  last  community  promised  a 
facility  to  receive  one.  Moreover,  Quilliq  Power  can  only  promise  a  gasoline  generator 
rated  at  5  kW. Given  the  lighting  and  heating  needs  of  the  community,  this may  not  be 
enough for the winter months. 
 
However,  there  is  currently  one  power  generator  in  Atsungiumajurniapaa.  It  is  a 
salvaged  ski-sled  engine  that  a  local  woman  converted  into  a  generator  for  the 
community  building.  Since  it  is  so  inefficient,  it  is  only  used  in  emergencies  and  is 

capable  of  generating  1200W  (original  rating  was  3.7hp).    Generally,  though,  the  main 
source of heat and light is whale and seal blubber and oil. Any fuel that is imported from 
Naujat  is  used  to  power  the  generator  or  the  4  ski  sleds,  which  are  very  important  for 
hunting.  In  fact,  most  everything  needed  from  the  outside  world,  from  electric  parts  to 
cooking utensils  to  foodstuffs, must be  imported  from Naujat at a premium. The cost  for 
milk,  for  instance,  can  top  $8  US/liter.  Fuel,  then,  is  also  very  expensive  and  can  cost 
close  to $5.75/liter. All  items  that  travel  to  the Canadian North are extremely expensive, 
mostly due to transport costs. 
 
The  villagers’  main  source  of  income  is  the  export  of  traditional  crafts  and  music  and 
adjustment payments given by  the Canadian government  for  the diamond mine  located 
within  their  community’s  traditional  boundary.  This  money  is  generally  pooled  and 
directed towards collective needs by consensus decision. Their first priority, however,  is 
food, warmth and  fuel  for hunting, which accounts for approximately 80% of the budget. 
The  Inuit  have  little  concept  of  “mine”  and  are  very  open  to  the  idea  of  shared 
resources.  As  such,  there  is  great  potential  for  adoption  of  a  community-based  power 
solution if the right price can be reached. They envision electricity being used to provide 
heating  and  light  in  the  main  community  building  (which  houses  a  shop  and  meeting 
hall),  light  personal  houses  and  run  a  small  yet-to-be-built  medical  clinic  operating 
medical equipment.  
 
Notes: 
  
Some  of  the  major  organizations  that  could  be  approached  as  potential  resources  of 
capital support include  
•  The Canadian Government

Nyaja Chiefdom, Zambia 
Latitude: 14º 8’ South  Longitude: 30º 50’ East 
Time Zone: GMT+1 (6 hrs ahead of EST) - 
 
Nyaja Chiefdom  is a  remote  rural area  in  the Nyimba district of  the Eastern Province of 
Zambia.  Nyimba is the closest city with grid electricity, but it is 60km away and requires 
a  4-wheel  drive  vehicle  to  manage  the  rough  road.    The  next  closest  city  is  Petauke, 
which  is  about  79km  away.    Diesel,  batteries,  or  kerosene  can  be  bought  from  one  of 
these two towns, and usually traders sell them in Nyaja for a higher cost. 
 
In Nyaja, 43  villages are divided  into 5  sections, with  the  furthest  section being about a 
1.5 hour walk  from  the chief’s compound.   Each village  is composed of  family groups of 
six  to  ten  people.   Most  villagers  are  subsistence  farmers who  cultivate  primarily maize 
for  their  family’s  consumption.    The  plot  size  varies  from  0.25  to  1  hectare  of  land  per 
family.  Most  families  do  not  own  any  livestock,  but  those  that  do,  only  own  a  few 
chickens  or  goats  which  are  allowed  to  roam  freely  around  the  village.    There  are  250 
households  in an area of 50,000 hectares, so  families do not always border each other. 
Much of the area around the river is a flood plain.  During each annual rainy season, the 
average  total  rainfall  is 950mm. A  stream divides one of  the  five  sections  from  the  rest, 
and  is  not  passable  by  foot  in  the  rainy  season.    The Mvuvye  river  also  isolates  Nyaja 
Chiefdom  from  nearby  cities  during  the  rainy  season.   Most  villages  have  easy  access 
to water, but these surface water sources run dry during the dry season. 
 
There  are  currently  no  electricity  generators  in  Nyaja.    The  Chief  has  one  diesel-
powered  grain  mill,  for  which  villagers  pay  a  fee  to  use.    The  Nyimba  District  Health 
office  supplies  the  kerosene  to  power  the  vaccine  refrigerator  at  the  clinic.    There  are 
four PV  systems  in Nyaja, which  are  owned  by  the Chief,  the  clinic  nurse,  a  successful 
store-owner,  and  the  school.    The  average  family  cooks  on  a  three  stone  wood  or 
charcoal  fire, uses  candles  for  light at night, and buys batteries  for  flashlights or  radios.  
Grid-distributed  electric  power  is  unlikely  to  be  accessible  in  the  region  for  at  least  one 
or  two  decades.    Power  from  the  grid  is  generated  from  one  of  Zambia’s  many 
hydroelectric  dams.    The  nearest  grid  electricity  is  currently  about  60  km  away. 
Electricity  would  be  used  primarily  for  lighting  and  radios.   A  battery  charging  station 
might be feasible if people had access to car batteries. 
 
When  considering  a  system  for  this  community,  it  is  important  to  consider  the  capital 
resources  of  the  community.    Few  people  in  this  area  have  formal  employment;  most 
are  subsistence  farmers,  some  bake  buns,  a  couple  people  have  small  stores  or  bars 
that sell necessities and serve as a social  gathering place. As such, most villagers only 
have  very  small  quantities  of  cash,  and  only  a  few  of  the  wealthier  or  professionally 
employed  villagers,  like  the  clinic  nurse,  save  large  sums  of  money.  Typically,  to  buy 

something  of  high  value,  one  can  take  out  informal  loans  from  relatives  or  some  of  the 
wealthier  villagers  for  as  high  an  interest  rate  as  50%.    Recently,  the  concept  of  group 
lending  was  introduced  to  provide  a  means  for  women  to  save  money  and  generate 
income by lending money to others.  A group of women contribute a small amount each 
week to a group fund that can be lent to other villagers who pay it back with interest.    
 
Some  of  the  major  organizations  that  could  be  approached  as  potential  resources  of 
capital support include  
•  Basic Education Sub-Sector Investment Programme 
•  PVESCO (Photo-Voltaic Energy Service Company) program 
•  Microfinance institutions may be an option, if the energy is being used to 
generate income.  
These are some of  the current big players that may be relevant to energy access  in this 
area.   Development  of  the  interior  and  rural  areas  has  in  theory  been  a  high  priority  for 
the  state  and  federal  governments  in  Zambia,  however  in  practice,  remote  villages  like 
Nyaja have not benefited from these programs. 
 
Choosing  the  appropriate  types  of  energy  for  this  area  is  very  important  to  the  success 
in  improving  access  to  energy  and  any  subsequent  economic  development.    The  table 
on the following page may assist you in assessing options for energy sources. 
 
Not  all  information  needed  to  present  a  strong  report  is  necessarily  contained  in  this 
document.  More  outside  research  (include  sources  and  verify  their  reliability!)  and 
careful  consideration  of  conditions  will  be  needed  to  make  a  strong  assessment  and 
design an appropriate system.

Boipelego Village, Phamong, Lesotho 
Latitude: 29º 22’S  Longitude: 29º 02’E 
Time Zone: GMT +2 
 
The  Phamong  region  is  home  to  several  small  farming  communities  which  cluster 
around  the  water  of  the  wide,  muddy  Senqu  River.  Boipelogo  is  one  of  the  more 
developed  villages, with a  large  church  that attracts Christians  for worship  from  several 
neighboring  communities  on  Sundays.  There  is  also  a  technical  centre,  the  Boipelego 
Business  and  Community  Development  Centre.  While  this  school  is  currently  self-
sufficient  in energy  through  the use of solar panels, continued expansion  is planned, so 
additional  power  at  the  school  will  be  required.  There  is  also  a  clinic,  two  small  stores 
which each have a large meat-storing refrigerator, and a public elementary school which 
educates about one hundred kids annually. In the village, there are around 100 families, 
each  with  about  six  to  ten  members.  Most  of  the  men  work  the  soybean  and  maize 
fields  during  the  day,  with  families  working  on  large,  multi-acre  community  plots  rather 
than smaller  fields. The  terrain  is harsh and dry, with cracked gullies running across  the 
landscape  as  a  result  of  massive  erosion.  The  typical  home  has  a  small  radio,  a  few 
10W light bulbs, and perhaps a black and white television. The radios are usually on for 
most  of  the  day,  with  the  lights  running  for  five  or  six  hours  at  night  and  the  TV  used 
only for a couple of hours each night. Cooking is done using biomass, and most women 
spend  two  to  three hours per day collecting wood  to burn. While power was supplied by 
a diesel generator in the village to about half the homes, recent increases in the price of 
diesel  of  nearly  25%  (Current  price  =  7    Rand  (ZAR)  per  liter)  have made  this  a  costly 
option.    
 
There  are  other  resources  available  in  the  area.  Solar  radiation  is  high,  with  over  300 
days  of  sun  a  year.  However,  solar  panels  are  expensive  to  use,  as  they  have  to  be 
imported  from  South  Africa.  Panels  cost  about  4US$/watt,  and  there  have  been 
problems  with  theft.  Any  type  of  12V  battery  can  be  purchased  for  around  50US$  in 
Johannesburg, about a five hour drive away. There are no  local recharging stations, but 
the  batteries  can  be  brought  to  Mohale’s  Hoek  for  a  recharge  (2  hrs  away).  Inverters 
can also be purchased  in Johannesburg  for around 60US$.   Locally,  the Senqu River  is 
another potential source of power.   High-flow micro-hydro  turbines, such as  the Francis 
or  Kaplan  (efficiencies  around  90%),  can  be  purchased  for  around  US$2,000  and 
brought  to  Boipelego  from  Lesotho.  The  river  has  a  flow  of  5m3/s  in  the  summer,  but 
flow  varies  tremendously.  In  the  winter,  the  flow  is  around  2m3/s,  and  rainstorms 
(Common  from  December  to  February)  can  increase  flow  to  almost  7m3/s.  The  river  is 
about  100m  wide,  though  the  seasonal  variation  in  flow  means  that  the  actual  height 
varies from 1m to 3m. Any bank-mounted  installed turbine would have to factor  in some 
downtime  for  when  the  height  of  the  river  or  amount  of  flow  was  outside  operating 
parameters.  Wind  power  is  also  an  option,  though  the  variation  is  rather  high.  Wind 
turbines  can be bought  in  Johannesburg  for around US$800  (efficiencies around 40%), 

or  they could be constructed of  locally available materials  like  fiberglass and wood  for a 
slightly  lower cost (but also a  lower efficiency of around 30%). Speeds of 5m/s to 10m/s 
can  be  found  consistently  at  the  tops  of  some  nearby  peaks,  but  their  distance  from 
Boipelego is 1km to 2km.  
 
Grid electricity is not widespread in Lesotho, and only about 10% of rural locations are 
electrified. Boipelego is about two hours from Mohale’s Hoek (which does have grid 
connection) along a dirt road, and the closest village with electrification is located on the 
other side of the Senqu. Diesel and liquefied natural gas are available but are costly, 
and transportation is a major issue for the community. As for technical skills, the 
students at the technical centre are skilled in welding, and some could be hired to 
maintain the generation scheme for a relatively low cost (10% greater than the average 
per capita income in Lesotho).  
 
Loans are available from the government for some electrification projects, but interest 
rates are high (nearly 40%). The people do not have many assets that could be used as 
collateral; instead, most of their income tends to come from working in the South African 
mines and gets spent for food or other immediate needs.   
 
Some of the major organizations that could be approached as potential resources of 
capital support include  
•  Appropriate Technology Services, a Maseru-based government organization that 
works in disseminating appropriate technology for rural communities. They have 
partnered with D-Lab in the past (More information can be found about ATS at 
http://web.mit.edu/ats) 
•  World Bank, as they are currently funding a project on parabolic solar troughs 
that are used as solar thermal power generators. This project was started by an 
MIT student who actually led the D-Lab Lesotho trip for the past two years 
(http://www.synergeticpower.org/). 
These are some of the current big players that may be relevant to energy access in this 
area.  Development of the interior and rural areas has always been a high priority for the 
government of Lesotho, and energy access is one of the key factors in economic 
development. 
 
Not  all  information  needed  to  present  a  strong  report  is  necessarily  contained  in  this 
document.  More  outside  research  (include  sources  and  verify  their  reliability!)  and 
careful  consideration  of  conditions  will  be  needed  to  make  a  strong  assessment  and 
design an appropriate system.

Assentamento Pirarucu, Tocantins, Brazil 
Latitude: -11º 48’  Longitude: -49º 28’ 
Time Zone: GMT -3 
 
The  Assentamento  Pirarucu  is  in  rural  Tocantins,  Brazil,  near  the  Rio  Javaé.    In 
Assentamento  Pirarucu,  family  groups  of  six  to  ten  people  live  on  acres  of  otherwise 
isolated  land.    Each  family  owns  approximately  75  hectares  of  land.  The  families  all 
have  livestock  (a  typical  family  may  have  6  cows,  4  pigs  and  some  chickens),  and 
cultivate  plants  like  corn  and  cassava  (approximately  1  hectare).  Other  plants  like 
grasses,  palm, mango,  papaya,  and  banana  grow  everywhere  they  are  allowed.  There 
are  150  households  in  an  area  of  24,000  hectares,  so  families  do  not  always  border 
each  other;  there  are  wetlands,  roads,  and  densely  forested  areas  between  family 
lands.  About  10  km  from  the  settlement  flows  the  Rio  Javaé;  the  closest  families  live 
about 5 km  from  the  river,  the  furthest are about 15 km away.   The  river  runs  through a 
wide  basin,  about  500 meters wide,  and  has  seasonal  variations  in  flow  rate with  rates 
of 10 L/s/km2 in the rainy season (November to April) and 2 L/s/km2 in the dry season. 
 
Generators  are  not  uncommon  now.    Families  that  have  a  generator  typically  use  it  to 
power  a  couple  overhead  incandescent  lights,  a  refrigerator,  a  fan,  and  a  television.  
Grid-distributed  electric  power  is  slowly  becoming  accessible  in  the  region,  and  should 
be  available  in  the  Assentamento  Pirarucu  within  five  years.    Power  from  this  grid  is 
from  one  of  Brazil’s  large  hydroelectric  dams.    The  nearest  grid  electricity  is  currently 
about 50 kilometers away. 
 
When  considering  a  system  for  this  community,  it  is  important  to  consider  the  capital 
resources  of  the  community.    Few  people  in  this  area  have  what  would  be  considered 
typical  jobs  in  the  US;  most  are  subsistence  farmers,  some  make  crafts,  a  couple 
people  have  “stores”  or  “bars”  that  sell  necessities  and  serve  as  a  social  gathering 
place. As such, cash (the real, plural reais) is only available in very small quantities, and 
saving and  investment  in money  is unheard of. Typically,  if one wants  to buy something 
of  high  value,  the  first  step  to  buying  it  is  to  sell  a  cow  or  other  animal.  Financial 
strategies  like  loans  are  hindered  by  high  interest  rates, which,  though  they  have  fallen 
in recent years, are still around 10%.   
 
Some  of  the  major  organizations  that  could  be  approached  as  potential  resources  of 
capital support include  
•  The  Instituto  Nacional  de  Colonização  e  Reforma  Agrária,  which  formed  the 
settlements  more  than  ten  years  ago  when  the  FUNAI  (Indigenous  Affairs 
Bureau) established an indigenous reservation nearby 
•  The  Fundação  Bradesco,  a  national  non-profit  which  runs  a  working  farm  and 
boarding  school  for  children  that  live  in  the  area  villages,  settlements,  and  small 

towns.    The  school  in  Canuanã,  near  the  Assentamento  Pirarucu,  is  a  D-Lab 
partner in Brazil. 
•  The  Instituto  de  Desenvolvimento  Rural  do  Estado  do  Tocantins,  the  rural

These are some of  the current big players that may be relevant to energy access  in this 
area.  Development of the interior and rural areas has always been a high priority for the 
state  and  federal  governments  in Brazil,  and  energy  access  is  one  of  the  key  factors  in 
economic development. 
 
Choosing  the  appropriate  types  of  energy  for  this  area  is  very  important  to  the  success 
in  improving  access  to  energy  and  any  subsequent  economic  development.    The  table 
on the following page may assist you in assessing options for energy sources. 
 
Not  all  information  needed  to  present  a  strong  report  is  necessarily  contained  in  this 
document.  More  outside  research  (include  sources  and  verify  their  reliability!)  and 
careful  consideration  of  conditions  will  be  needed  to  make  a  strong  assessment  and 
design an appropriate system.

Dikgomo, Ghanzi District, Botswana  
Latitude: -21º 45’  Longitude: 20º 5’   
Time Zone: GMT +2 
 
Dikgomo  is  a  small  village  in western  Botswana  in  the  Kalahari Desert  near  the  border 
with  Namibia.    The  land  surrounding  Dikgomo  is  primarily  small  cattle  posts,  where 
families  keep  their  cattle.  The  landscape  is  primarily  desert  scrub.    Most  of  the  land  is 
tribal  grazing  land, without  clear  ownership,  but  there  are  a  few  private  farms  about  15 
km from the village.  There are three times as many cattle as people, and twice as many 
goats  as  cattle. The  cattle  are  kept  at  the  cattle  posts, where  they  are  allowed  to  freely 
roam  and  graze;  the  goats  are  dispersed  throughout  the  cattle  posts  and  the  village.  
There are no permanent surface water sources—water in the village is provided through 
five  government-installed  boreholes  that  reach  into  a  water  table  approximately  100  m 
below the surface.  Some of the private farms have wind-powered pumps to supply their 
cattle  with  water.    The  seasonal  rains,  if  they  come,  arrive  in  December  and  fall 
sporadically until mid-February.    If  the  rains are good,  the desert becomes a grassland; 
if  not,  only  the  acacia  shrubs  show  signs  of  greenery.  During  the  rainy  season,  water 
accumulates  in  large  puddles  called  pans;  these  often  last  a  few  months  into  the  dry 
season,  but  rarely  until  the  beginning  of  the  next  rainy  season.    When  the  rains  are 
especially heavy,  the  roads become  impassable and  take up  to a week  to dry out.   The 
village  is about 700 km from the capital, Gaborone, the first 200 km  is paved, the rest  is 
a  poorly  maintained  track.    Transport  of  supplies  into  the  village  is  both  difficult  and 
expensive, as only the most rugged items survive the journey intact. 
 
Crops are not grown extensively  in  the area,  though  there are some plots of maize,  it  is 
not  uncommon  for  the  crop  to  fail  due  to  drought.    When  this  does  happen,  the 
government  drought  relief  program  provides  bags  of  “mealie  meal”  which  the  villagers 
use  to  make  a  thick  porridge  to  eat  with  the  meat.    Few  vegetables  are  grown,  but 
during  the  rainy  season,  there  are  many  wild  plants  that  grow  in  the  bush  that  can  be 
harvested and consumed. 
 
There  are  70  households  concentrated  in  the  village  each  comprised  of  several 
rondavels  that  make  up  the  family  compound.    Children  from  these  families  attend  the 
Dikgomo  primary  school;  those  that  pass  their  primary  leaving  exam  join  students  from 
five  surrounding  villages  to  attend  the  Kgalagadi  Community  Secondary  School,  which 
is  also  located  in  the  village.    The  government  pays  for  the  school  to  provide  tea  and 
bread  to  the  students  during  the  morning  break,  and  also  a  hot  meal  at  lunch.   
Traditionally,  food  is  cooked  in  three-legged  pots  over  a wood  fire.   Wood  has  become 
scarce  in  the  area  surrounding  the  village  and  is  often  brought  to  the  school  using  the 
headmaster’s  pick-up  truck.   Sometimes,  the meal  program must  be  suspended  due  to 
a lack of cooking fuel. 

 
None of the households have electricity, except the headmaster, who has a small diesel 
generator.  Light  is  produced  by  kerosene  lanterns  or  candles.    Few  of  the  adults  in  the 
village  have  a  formal  education,  and  although  there  is  an  interest  in  adult  education 
programs,  they  have  been  difficult  to  sustain,  due  to  the  lack  of  lighting  at  the  school.  
There  is a new clinic  that has been built on  the edge of  the village, and  the government 
has stationed a nurse at  the site, however  the services are quite  limited, due  to  the  lack 
of equipment.     The  closest grid electricity  is  in  the mining  town of  Jwaneng, about 500 
km away. 
 
When  considering  a  system  for  this  community,  it  is  important  to  consider  the  capital 
resources  of  the  community.    Livestock  is  the  traditional  measure  of  wealth,  and  most 
people  would  rather  invest  in  a  cow  than  a  bank.    As  such,  cash  (the  pula,  which  is 
setswana for “rain”) is only available in very small quantities, and saving and investment 
in  money  is  rare.    Bank  loans  are  available  at  a  15%  interest  rate,  though  few  people 
apply  for  them.    Typically,  if  one wants  to  buy  something  of  high  value,  the  first  step  to 
buying  it  is  to  sell  a  cow  or  a  goat.  The  Botswana  Meat  Commission  provides  a  high 
price  for  livestock,  as  part  of  a  European  Union  aid  package,  though  transport  to  the 
abattoir  takes  about  10%  of  the  profits.    Few  people  in  this  area  have  formal 
employment;  some  make  crafts,  a  couple  people  have  small  stores  or  bars  that  sell 
necessities  and  serve  as  a  social  gathering  place.    There  is  currently  a  government 
initiative  to  promote  micro-enterprise,  and  several  indigenous  plants  have  been 
identified as having a high value on the tourist market.  Although low interest loans (5%) 
are available as part of this initiative, no groups have formed to take advantage of them, 
due  to  the  difficulties  in  drying  and  packaging  the  plants.    The  sealing  equipment  for 
packaging  the  teas  and  dried  fruit,  though  relatively  inexpensive,  requires  electricity  to 
operate.  
 
Historically, development priorities have targeted educational initiatives; electrification of 
rural  areas  has  not  been  a  high  priority.    Recently,  however,  the  government  has 
recognized  the  importance  of  infrastructure  to  economic  development  and  has  shifted 
some  of  its  resources  to  rural  electrification  schemes.  The  government  of  Botswana 
now offers a 500 pula subsidy for people interested in installing photo-voltaic systems in 
rural  areas.    The  table  on  the  following  page  may  assist  you  in  assessing  options  for 
energy systems. 

 
Not  all  information  needed  to  present  a  strong  report  is  necessarily  contained  in  this 
document.  More  outside  research  (include  sources  and  verify  their  reliability!)  and 
careful  consideration  of  conditions  will  be  needed  to  make  a  strong  assessment  and 
design an appropriate system.

Vumba Chiefdom, Zambia 
Latitude: 14º 8’ South  Longitude: 30º 50’ East 
Time Zone: GMT+1 (6 hrs ahead of EST) - 
 
Vumba Chiefdom is a remote rural area in the Nyimba district of the Eastern Province of 
Zambia.  Nyimba is the closest city with grid electricity, but it is 60km away and requires 
a  4-wheel  drive  vehicle  to  manage  the  rough  road.    The  next  closest  city  is  Petauke, 
which  is  about  79km  away.    Diesel,  batteries,  or  kerosene  can  be  bought  from  one  of 
these two towns, and usually traders sell them in Vumba for a higher cost. 
 
In Vumba, 43 villages are divided into 5 sections, with the furthest section being about a 
1.5 hour walk  from  the chief’s compound.   Each village  is composed of  family groups of 
six  to  ten  people.   Most  villagers  are  subsistence  farmers who  cultivate  primarily maize 
for  their  family’s  consumption.    The  plot  size  varies  from  0.25  to  1  hectare  of  land  per 
family.  Most  families  do  not  own  any  livestock,  but  those  that  do,  only  own  a  few 
chickens  or  goats  which  are  allowed  to  roam  freely  around  the  village.    There  are  250 
households  in an area of 50,000 hectares, so  families do not always border each other. 
Much of the area around the river is a flood plain.  During each annual rainy season, the 
average  total  rainfall  is 950mm. A  stream divides one of  the  five  sections  from  the  rest, 
and  is not passable by  foot  in  the  rainy season.   The Mvuvye  river also  isolates Vumba 
Chiefdom  from  nearby  cities  during  the  rainy  season.   Most  villages  have  easy  access 
to water, but these surface water sources run dry during the dry season. 
 
There  are  currently  no  electricity  generators  in  Vumba.    The  Chief  has  one  diesel-
powered  grain  mill,  for  which  villagers  pay  a  fee  to  use.    The  Nyimba  District  Health 
office  supplies  the  kerosene  to  power  the  vaccine  refrigerator  at  the  clinic.    There  are 
four PV systems in Vumba, which are owned by the Chief, the clinic nurse, a successful 
store-owner,  and  the  school.    The  average  family  cooks  on  a  three  stone  wood  or 
charcoal  fire, uses  candles  for  light at night, and buys batteries  for  flashlights or  radios.  
Grid-distributed  electric  power  is  unlikely  to  be  accessible  in  the  region  for  at  least  one 
or  two  decades.    Power  from  the  grid  is  generated  from  one  of  Zambia’s  many 
hydroelectric  dams.    The  nearest  grid  electricity  is  currently  about  60  km  away. 
Electricity  would  be  used  primarily  for  lighting  and  radios.   A  battery  charging  station 
might be feasible if people had access to car batteries. 
 
When  considering  a  system  for  this  community,  it  is  important  to  consider  the  capital 
resources  of  the  community.    Few  people  in  this  area  have  formal  employment;  most 
are  subsistence  farmers,  some  bake  buns,  a  couple  people  have  small  stores  or  bars 
that sell necessities and serve as a social  gathering place. As such, most villagers only 
have  very  small  quantities  of  cash,  and  only  a  few  of  the  wealthier  or  professionally 
employed  villagers,  like  the  clinic  nurse,  save  large  sums  of  money.  Typically,  to  buy 

something  of  high  value,  one  can  take  out  informal  loans  from  relatives  or  some  of  the 
wealthier  villagers  for  as  high  an  interest  rate  as  50%.    Recently,  the  concept  of  group 
lending  was  introduced  to  provide  a  means  for  women  to  save  money  and  generate 
income by lending money to others.  A group of women contribute a small amount each 
week to a group fund that can be lent to other villagers who pay it back with interest.    
 
Some  of  the  major  organizations  that  could  be  approached  as  potential  resources  of 
capital support include  
•  Basic Education Sub-Sector Investment Programme 
•  PVESCO (Photo-Voltaic Energy Service Company) program 
•  Microfinance institutions may be an option, if the energy is being used to 
generate income.  
These are some of  the current big players that may be relevant to energy access  in this 
area.   Development  of  the  interior  and  rural  areas  has  in  theory  been  a  high  priority  for 
the  state  and  federal  governments  in  Zambia,  however  in  practice,  remote  villages  like 
Vumba have not benefited from these programs. 
 
Choosing  the  appropriate  types  of  energy  for  this  area  is  very  important  to  the  success 
in  improving  access  to  energy  and  any  subsequent  economic  development.    The  table

Diesel costs less in Lusaka, and more 
as you travel further from the capital. 
In Vumba, the diesel is sold by store  
owners who make more than 50% profit. 

Many villagers in Vumba know how to 
make traditional fired clay bricks from 
local soil so they do not buy commercial 
bricks. 

There are some places in Zambia that  
have winds greater than 5m/s, but 
Vumba is not one of them.  

Most people in Zambia live on less than 
$1/day.  There is about a 50%  
unemployment rate.  Most villagers are 
subsistence farmers so they have little 
cash income.

Boipuso Village, Phamong, Lesotho 
Latitude: 29º 22’S  Longitude: 29º 02’E 
Time Zone: GMT +2 
 
The  Phamong  region  is  home  to  several  small  farming  communities  which  cluster 
around  the  water  of  the  wide,  muddy  Senqu  River.  Boipuso  is  one  of  the  more 
developed  villages, with a  large  church  that attracts Christians  for worship  from  several 
neighboring  communities  on  Sundays.  There  is  also  a  technical  centre,  the  Boipuso 
Business  and  Community  Development  Centre.  While  this  school  is  currently  self-
sufficient  in energy  through  the use of solar panels, continued expansion  is planned, so 
additional  power  at  the  school  will  be  required.  There  is  also  a  clinic,  two  small  stores 
which each have a large meat-storing refrigerator, and a public elementary school which 
educates about one hundred kids annually. In the village, there are around 100 families, 
each  with  about  six  to  ten  members.  Most  of  the  men  work  the  soybean  and  maize 
fields  during  the  day,  with  families  working  on  large,  multi-acre  community  plots  rather 
than smaller  fields. The  terrain  is harsh and dry, with cracked gullies running across  the 
landscape  as  a  result  of  massive  erosion.  The  typical  home  has  a  small  radio,  a  few 
10W light bulbs, and perhaps a black and white television. The radios are usually on for 
most  of  the  day,  with  the  lights  running  for  five  or  six  hours  at  night  and  the  TV  used 
only for a couple of hours each night. Cooking is done using biomass, and most women 
spend  two  to  three hours per day collecting wood  to burn. While power was supplied by 
a diesel generator in the village to about half the homes, recent increases in the price of 
diesel  of  nearly  25%  (Current  price  =  7    Rand  (ZAR)  per  liter)  have made  this  a  costly 
option.    
 
There  are  other  resources  available  in  the  area.  Solar  radiation  is  high,  with  over  300 
days  of  sun  a  year.  However,  solar  panels  are  expensive  to  use,  as  they  have  to  be 
imported  from  South  Africa.  Panels  cost  about  4US$/watt,  and  there  have  been 
problems  with  theft.  Any  type  of  12V  battery  can  be  purchased  for  around  50US$  in 
Johannesburg, about a five hour drive away. There are no  local recharging stations, but 
the  batteries  can  be  brought  to  Mohale’s  Hoek  for  a  recharge  (2  hrs  away).  Inverters 
can also be purchased  in Johannesburg  for around 60US$.   Locally,  the Senqu River  is 
another potential source of power.   High-flow micro-hydro  turbines, such as  the Francis 
or  Kaplan  (efficiencies  around  90%),  can  be  purchased  for  around  US$2,000  and 
brought  to Boipuso  from Lesotho. The  river has a  flow of 5m3/s  in  the summer, but  flow 
varies  tremendously.  In  the  winter,  the  flow  is  around  2m3/s,  and  rainstorms  (Common 
from December to February) can increase flow to almost 7m3/s. The river is about 100m 
wide,  though  the seasonal variation  in  flow means  that  the actual height varies  from 1m 
to  3m.  Any  bank-mounted  installed  turbine  would  have  to  factor  in  some  downtime  for 
when  the  height  of  the  river  or  amount  of  flow was  outside  operating  parameters. Wind 
power is also an option, though the variation is rather high. Wind turbines can be bought 
in  Johannesburg  for  around  US$800  (efficiencies  around  40%),  or  they  could  be 

constructed  of  locally  available  materials  like  fiberglass  and  wood  for  a  slightly  lower 
cost (but also a lower efficiency of around 30%). Speeds of 5m/s to 10m/s can be found 
consistently at the tops of some nearby peaks, but their distance from Boipuso is 1km to 
2km.  
 
Grid  electricity  is  not widespread  in  Lesotho,  and  only  about  10%  of  rural  locations  are 
electrified.  Boipuso  is  about  two  hours  from  Mohale’s  Hoek  (which  does  have  grid 
connection) along a dirt road, and the closest village with electrification is located on the 
other  side  of  the  Senqu.  Diesel  and  liquefied  natural  gas  are  available  but  are  costly, 
and  transportation  is  a  major  issue  for  the  community.  As  for  technical  skills,  the 
students  at  the  technical  centre  are  skilled  in  welding,  and  some  could  be  hired  to 
maintain  the generation scheme  for a  relatively  low cost  (10% greater  than  the average 
per capita income in Lesotho).  
 
Loans  are  available  from  the  government  for  some  electrification  projects,  but  interest 
rates are high (nearly 40%). The people do not have many assets that could be used as 
collateral; instead, most of their income tends to come from working in the South African 
mines and gets spent for food or other immediate needs.   
 
Some  of  the  major  organizations  that  could  be  approached  as  potential  resources  of 
capital support include  
•  Appropriate Technology Services, a Maseru-based government organization  that 
works  in  disseminating  appropriate  technology  for  rural  communities.  They  have 
partnered  with  D-Lab  in  the  past  (More  information  can  be  found  about  ATS  at 
http://web.mit.edu/ats) 
•  World  Bank,  as  they  are  currently  funding  a  project  on  parabolic  solar  troughs 
that  are  used  as  solar  thermal  power  generators.  This  project was  started  by  an 
MIT  student  who  actually  led  the  D-Lab  Lesotho  trip  for  the  past  two  years 
(http://www.synergeticpower.org/). 
These are some of  the current big players that may be relevant to energy access  in this 
area.  Development of the interior and rural areas has always been a high priority for the 
government  of  Lesotho,  and  energy  access  is  one  of  the  key  factors  in  economic 
development. 
 
Not  all  information  needed  to  present  a  strong  report  is  necessarily  contained  in  this

Preak Russei, Kaoh Thum District, Kandal Province, Cambodia 
Latitude: 11º 33’N  Longitude: 104º 60’E 
Time Zone: GMT +7 
 
Preak  Russei  is  a  village  of  about  500  households  located  5  hours  north  of  Phnom 
Penh,  the  capital  of  Cambodia.  The  closest  town  with  an  electrical  grid  is  in  the 
neighboring  district  of  Kien  Svay,  which  is  over  3  hours  away  with  a  river  crossing. 
There has been a government initiative to extend power lines into Kaoh Thum since last 
year,  but  transportation  of  the  necessary  supplies  and  workforce  is  challenging  due  to 
the  distance  and  geography.  As  a  result,  construction  has  not  begun  and  spools  of 
power  cables  are  still  sitting  in  a  town  near  the  borders  of  the  Kien  Svay  and  Kaoh 
Thum districts. 
 
Most  households  in  Preak  Russei  use  kerosene  or  candles  for  lighting,  though  a  few 
wealthier  households  have  access  to  car  batteries  for  powering  lamps  or  even  small 
television  sets.  Four  years  ago,  the  head  of  the  village  development  committee 
purchased  a  small  diesel  generator  and  his  sons  now  run  a  small  enterprise  that 
charges  batteries  for  a  small  fee.  Households  with  batteries  report  spending 
approximately  $5  a  month  on  charging  services,  walking  up  to  3  km  to  charge  their 
batteries a couple times each week. 
 
Preak  Russei  is  primarily  a  farming  community,  with  rice  being  the  main  crop.  Many 
households  also  raise  livestock  such  as  chickens,  goats,  pigs  and  a  cow  or  two  for 
farming  help  and  supply  of milk. Biomass  is  typically  used  for  cooking,  but  some  of  the 
more  prosperous  households  use  canisters  of  natural  gas  which  are  trucked  in  from 
town  and  ferried  across  the  river  on  a  motorized  wooden  raft.  The  river  running  along 
Preak  Russei  has  a  very  languorous  flow  that  diminishes  in  the  dry  season,  but  there 
are some wind resources available and the region receives over 300 days of sun. 
 
The  commune  council  and  village  development  committee  have  been working  together 
to  build  community  latrines  and  expand  the  primary  school.  There  has  been  political 
pressure  to  install  a  couple  CFL  or  LED  lamps  at  the  school  so  children  of  less 
prosperous  families  may  have  a  place  to  do  homework  at  night.  Another  ongoing 
community  project  is  a  center  to  provide  safe  drinking  water,  designed  and  built  by  a 
local NGO called Resource Development International Cambodia (RDIC) in 2007. RDIC 
has  recently  started  investigating  the  possibility  of  installing  a  small  photovoltaic  panel 
to  provide  electricity  for  the  water  treatment  equipment.  A  12V  car  battery  is  currently 
being  used  for  powering  the  arsenic  removal  system*  and  the  UV  disinfection  system, 
as well as charging cell phones  in  the village  for a nominal  fee. Proceeds  from  the sale 
of  clean  water  ($0.03  for  10  liters,  usually  sold  in  a  bottle)  and  charging  services  go 
towards maintaining the water center. 
 

Loans are available  from  the government  for some domestic electrification projects, but 
interest  rates  are  high  (nearly  35%)  and  the  commune  council  would  need  to  apply  as 
the  program  is  not  open  to  single  households.  Most  households,  with  the  exception  of 
the  village  head  and  other  prosperous  families,  do  not  have many  assets  that  could  be 
used  as  collateral.  Most  families  receive  their  income  from  farming  or  children  working 
in  Phnom  Penh  and  spend  it  on  food  or  other  immediate  needs.  Though  villagers  in 
Preak Russei do not typically have a lot of cash on hand, there is a precedent of people 
being  motivated  to  invest  in  infrastructure  improvements.  Last  summer,  some  families 
managed  to  save  enough  to  install  pipes  connecting  their  homes  to  the  local  water 
treatment center designed by RDIC. 
 
Some  of  the  major  organizations  that  could  be  approached  as  potential  resources  of 
capital support include  
•  Resource Development International Cambodia (RDIC), a local NGO that 
operates in the Kandal Province (http://www.rdic.org) 
•  1001 Fontaines, a French NGO that has started several solar-powered UV water 
treatment centers run by local entrepreneurs (http://www.1001fontaines.com/) 
•  Ministry of Rural Development, a program of the Cambodian government 
These are some of  the current big players that may be relevant to energy access  in this 
area.    Development  of  the  interior  and  rural  areas  has  been  a  high  priority  for  the 
government  of  Cambodia,  and  energy  access  is  one  of  the  key  factors  in  economic 
development. 
 
Not  all  information  needed  to  present  a  strong  report  is  necessarily  contained  in  this 
document.  More  outside  research  (include  sources  and  verify  their  reliability!)  and 
careful  consideration  of  conditions  will  be  needed  to  make  a  strong  assessment  and 
design an appropriate system. 
 
 
*  Arsenic  contamination  in  groundwater  is  a major  concern  for  Preak Russei  and  other 
villages  situated  in  the  lower  Mekong  river  basin.  It  has  been  referred  to  as  the  worst 
case  of mass  poisoning  in  human  history,  affecting  an  estimated  2 million  in Cambodia 
and  140  million  worldwide.  Naturally  occurring  arsenic  is  called  a  silent  killer  because 
the  chemical  is  colorless,  odorless  and  tasteless.  Exposure  to  high  concentrations  of 
arsenic over a prolonged period of time can cause disease like arsenicosis, in which the 
affected person develops  lesions on  the hands and  feet  that make  it painful  to walk and 
work.  Ultimately,  accumulation  of  arsenic  in  the  body  can  lead  to  organ  failure  and 
death. Ground  wells  in  Preak  Russei  have  been  shown  to  have  arsenic  concentrations 
as  high  as  1000-2000  ppb,  while  the World  Health  Organization  standards  for  drinking 
water are 5 ppb.

Bermojur Kachhari Ghat, Sunderbans, West Bengal, India 
Latitude: 22º 32’N  Longitude: 90º 20’E 
Time Zone: GMT +5:30 
 
The  Sunderbans  is  part  of  the  world’s  largest  delta  and  is  interwoven  by  a  network  of 
small  rivers,  creeks  and waterways.  There  are  roughly  50  habitable mangrove-forested 
islands  just  above  the  sea  level,  which  are  protected  from  high  tides  by  bamboo 
reinforced clay dikes. Bermojur Kachhari Ghat  is a village of about 1000 people  located 
on  the  island  of  Sandeshkhali.  To  reach  Sandeshkhali  from  the  main  city  of  Kolkata, 
people  travel  by  road  for  3  hours  until  it  ends  in  Najat,  a  small  port  town.  From  Najat, 
Sandeshkhali  is  a  1  hour  boat  ride  away.  Access  is  even  more  difficult  between  the 
months  of  April  and  September,  when  cyclones  plague  the  area  with  destructive  high-
speed winds and monsoon rains flood the area. 
 
While  the  town  on mainland  has  an  electrical  grid,  it  is  too  difficult  and  costly  to  extend 
transmission lines across rivers and creeks to reach islands in the Sunderbans. None of 
the  households  in  Bermojur  Kachhari  Ghat  have  electricity  and  most  families  use 
kerosene  lanterns  or  candles  brought  by  boat  from  Najat.  Relatively  cheap  Chinese-
made  generators  and  diesel  can  also  be  purchased  on  mainland,  but  the  Indian 
government  recently  raised  the  price  of  diesel  by  $0.04/L  in  response  to  an  increase  in 
the  price  of  crude  oil.  While  there  are  currently  no  diesel  generators  on  Sandeshkhali 
island,  a  few  wealthier  households  on  neighboring  islands  have  them.  The  main 
livelihoods  in  Bermojur  Kachhari  Ghat  are  rice  farming,  fishing,  or  catching  tiger  prawn 
spawn and selling  them  to commercial  farms  that produce giant  tiger prawns  for export. 
Many  households  also  own  a  few  sheep  and  some  chickens,  but  goats  and  cows  are 
rarer  because  of  the  difficulty  of  raising  them  in  a  wet  island  environment.  Most 
available cow dung  is dried and used for cooking. The region also has around 300 days 
of sun and average wind speeds of about 5 m/s. About 20% of the  inhabited islands are 
currently  using  solar  photovoltaic  systems  and  the  nearby  Bengal  tiger  reserve  uses 
small  windmills  to  power  water  pumps. While  there  are  some  fast  creeks  and  rivers  in 
the  Sunderbans, 
their  paths  and  speeds  can  vary  widely  and  unpredictably. 
Sandeshkhali island is situated between two of the larger and slower flowing rivers. 
 
The  island  has  a  long  and  narrow  shape  that  is  approximately  half  a  kilometer  by  10 
kilometers. Bermojur Kachhari Ghat  is  located on  the southern half, and another village 
is  located  on  the  northern  half.  Generating  the  political  will  for  infrastructure 
development  projects  on  the  island  is  often  complicated,  because  the  two  villages may 
not agree on where  to site  the projects. On  the  far north end of  the  island, a  local NGO 
called Friends of the Sunderbans has recently built a primary school and health clinic  to 
serve  both  villages.  Few  of  the  adults  are  formally  educated  and  while  there  is  interest 
in an evening vocational  training program,  it has been difficult  to  implement without any 
lighting  at  the  school.  The  new  health  clinic  is  also  limited  by  a  lack  of  equipment. 

Supplies  are  brought  in  periodically  from  mainland  and  a  small  50W  refrigerator  has 
been donated, but there is no electricity for it to be utilized. Friends of the Sunderbans is 
currently  prioritizing  the  refrigerator  for  vaccines  and  medicine,  because  the  only  3 
water wells were  broken  and  contaminated  during  a  cyclone  earlier  this  year  and  there 
is  fear  of  a  cholera  or  typhoid  fever  breakout  on  the  island.  A  senior  staff  member  at 
Friends  of  the  Sunderbans  has  expressed  interest  in  becoming  a  co-investor  or 
providing  a  low-interest  loan  for  a  small  photovoltaic  system.  The  villagers  do  not  have 
much cash on hand, especially after  the  financial strain  from repairing damages caused 
by the recent cyclone. Most households have already used their savings by contributing 
to  a  village-wide  fund  for  the  reconstruction  of  wells  and  homes,  food  and  other 
immediate needs. 
 
Some of the major organizations that could be approached as potential resources of 
capital support include  
•  Friends of the Sunderbans, a local NGO run by Aunt Nilima, built and operates a 
primary school and health clinic on Sandeshkhali island 
•  West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency, a government program 
which has disseminated solar and wind energy to some villages in Sunderbans 
(http://www.wbreda.org) 
•  SELCO Solar Pvt. Ltd, a social enterprise that provides sustainable energy 
solutions and services to under-served households and businesses in India 
(http://www.selco-india.com) 
•  The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) in India and the Market Facilitating 
and Enterprise Development Organization (MFEDO), entities that jointly set up a 
pilot project in the Sunderbans where women are trained to be solar power 
entrepreneurs (http://www.terina.org/docs/Sunderbans.pdf) 
These are some of the current big players that may be relevant to energy access in this 
area.  Rural electrification has been a high priority for the government of India, and 
energy access is one of the key factors in economic development.
