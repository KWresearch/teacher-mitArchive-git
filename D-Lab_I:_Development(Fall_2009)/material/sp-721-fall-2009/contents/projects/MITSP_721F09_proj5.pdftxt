Due: October 30, 2009

  
Team Name: ________________________________ 
 
You  have  been  sent  to  a  small  academic  community  nestled  on  the  banks  of  a  river  in 
the  state  of  Massachusetts.    There  is  some  concern  that  the  water  that  flows  through 
this community is contaminated and may not be safe for drinking.  Your job is to test the 
water and make a report to the community leaders.   
 
List of Biological Contaminant Tests:  
 
Membrane Filtration, PetriFilm, Colilert, Pathoscreen 
 
List of Chemical Contaminant Tests: 
 
Ammonia-Nitrogen, Arsenic 
 
List of Water Quality Tests: 
 
Dissolved Oxygen, pH, Salinity 
 

1.  Describe  the  results  achieved  when  adding  PuR  to  turbid  water.  How  does  PuR 
work to flocculate? What is turbidity and how is it measured? 

2.  What  are  the  potential  health  risks  faced  by  this  community  if  they  continue 
drinking water from this source? Please include the health effects of any potential 
chemical  or  bacteriological  contaminant  for  which  we  tested  and  list  some 
potential sources of that contaminant.  

 
3.  Given the results of our water quality tests, what can you say about the quality of 
the  water  sources  tested?  Why  might  one  test  for  pH,  salinity  and  dissolved 
oxygen? 

4.  What are your recommendations for treatment of this water source?
