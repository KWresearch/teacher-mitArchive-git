Fall 2009

 
 
 

 
Using  materials 
in 
independent  research 
lectures,  readings  and 
from  course 
combination  with  a  profile  that  represents  a  partner  community,  your  team  of  regional 
energy specialists will propose an appropriate energy system for your village. 
 
Each  of  you  will  be  assigned  an  area  of  specialization  (biogas,  biodiesel,  photovoltaic, 
micro-hydroelectric,  wind)  to  research.    You  will  also  be  assigned  to  a  village  and  will 
need to become familiar with the environment and resources of your village as well.   
 
As a group you will develop a recommendation  for an energy system  for your village.    It 
may use a single technology or it may be a hybrid system.   
 
You  should  PROPERLY  CITE  ALL  SOURCES  and  list  ALL  ASSUMPTIONS  that  you 
have made  in  designing  your  system.  Also,  please  include  any  graphical  data  that  you 
deem  relevant  from  your  homer  analysis  in  the  body  of  your  report.  In  addition  please 
attach HOMER’s html report readout for your final system configuration(s) to your report 
as an appendix.  
 
Upload  your  report  and  your  .hmr  files  to  the  class  website  under  Village  Energy 
Assessment assignment. 
 
A HARD COPY of your team’s report is due in class on October 26. 
 
 
Resources: 
 

•  Practical Action (the organization formerly known as the Intermediate Technology 
Development Group) has a number of useful technical briefs that can be found 
at: http://practicalaction.org/?id=technical_briefs_energy 
•  NASA's Surface Solar Energy Data Set provides monthly average solar radiation 
data for everywhere on earth at http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/sse/.  
•  The HOMER help file contains a table of monthly solar data for selected 
worldwide locations.  
•  The South African Renewable Energy Resource Database provides solar, wind, 
hydro, and biomass resource data at http://www.sabregen.co.za/. (Permission 
Required) 
•  Wind Atlases of the World has links to wind maps and profiles from... all over the 
world.  Not all are created equal in terms of wealth of data.  
http://www.windatlas.dk/ 

•  Other resources found online or in hard copy may be needed. It is recommended 
that you attach your list of references on your final report, and be cognizant of the 
reliability of the data that you find, especially online.

Fully describe your village’s energy system: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Financial summary: 
 
Initial capital  US$ ______ 
 
Cost of electricity:  ______ US$/kWh 

Additional questions: 
•  Were  there  any  energy  options  that  were  clearly  viable  or  not  viable  for  your 
village?  Explain. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

•  Use  the  sensitivity  analysis  and  superimposition  in  HOMER  to  reconsider  your 
system  if  the  primary  load  doubled  or  tripled,  and  if  the  availability  of  one  of  the 
renewable  resources  your  group  chose  (e.g.  biogas,  hydro,  or  solar  energy) 
decreases between 1% and 20%.   How does  this  change  your  system?   Cost of 
electricity?  Perform  a  second  sensitivity  analysis  that  your  team  thinks  is  critical 
to  understanding  your  village’s  system’s  vulnerability  or  capacity.  Justify  this 
analysis. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  What would be your concerns about  the  implementation and sustainability of  this 
system?    [Note:  The  Smillie  text  may  have  some  good  lessons  learned  to  think 
about here!]
