Stove Project 
 Tibetan life revolves around the stove 

 Inefficient Stoves… 

 Produce harmful smoke 

 Consume too much fuel leading to 

 Deforestation 

 Wasted time spent searching for 
fuel 

 How can I help tackle this issue? 
 Disseminate good stove-use 

practices


 Develop quick-fixes to common 
problems using available materials 

 Study stoves to identify 

 Common stove features 

 Best practices 

 Areas for improvement

Project Goals 

12 

 Survey general household habits and use of burning yak dung 

 Measure greenhouse gas emissions for these activities, and 
calculate the cumulative footprint. 

 Survey the emissions for implemented solar cookers, and 
improved cleaner burning stoves 

 Create a preliminary report quantifying the carbon offsetting 
potential 

 Foundation for potential future goals: 

 Transitioning as a possible Clean Development Mechanism project 

 Report can spark further detailed analysis of carbon offsetting, and 
eventual Certified Emissions Reductions climate credit (under Kyoto 
Protocol) 

 Provide funding for the perpetuation of more solar cooker and 
improved stove projects in Qinghai
