***** Course Description *****
D-Lab Development addresses issues of technological improvements at the micro
level for developing countriesâin particular, how the quality of life of low-
income households can be improved by adaptation of low cost and sustainable
technologies. Discussion of development issues as well as project
implementation challenges are addressed through lectures, case studies, guest
speakers and laboratory exercises. Students form project teams to partner with
mostly local level organizations in developing countries, and formulate plans
for an IAP site visit. (Previous field sites include Ghana, Brazil, Honduras
and India.) Project team meetings focus on developing specific projects and
include cultural, social, political, environmental and economic overviews of
the countries and localities to be visited as well as an introduction to the
local languages.
