Evening film screenings: once every 2-3 weeks
Project team meetings: as arranged
***** Course Description *****
D-Lab: Development is part of the D-Lab_series of courses and field trips that
prepare students to respond to the basic needs of low-income households and
communities in developing nations with technological solutions that are
inexpensive, ecologically sustainable and able to be implemented within the
local context.
This course introduces various notions of development, and explores several
technological innovations that enhance the quality of life in these
communities. The course also prepares students to focus on specific issues,
such as the need for potable water, low-cost agricultural processing equipment,
basic sanitation, and affordable energy, specifically in communities where
students will travel during IAP [MIT's Independent_Activity_Period, a month-
long intersession between fall and spring terms.] Students will develop working
relationships with partnering institutions in developing nations to ensure that
the field trips provide both a learning opportunity and an international social
network to test the viability of technological solutions jointly crafted by the
students and the hosting communities.
D-Lab: Development begins with a historical understanding of why conventional
developmental efforts have not universally enhanced the quality of life of low-
income households and communities. This is followed by a series of hands-on
workshops in which students learn practical approaches towards addressing these
issues. These workshops are interspersed with discussions and case studies, led
by the course staff and guest speakers who have developed and implemented
technological solutions in specific topic areas such as: energy, lighting
systems, agricultural technologies, low-cost housing, water, sanitation, micro
enterprises, and health. The discussion of case studies also provides students
the opportunity to select problem areas for deeper engagement during the IAP
field trip. The third part of the course is focused on the preparation for the
field trip by sensitizing students to the realities of fieldwork in unfamiliar
settings, and discussing how to build enduring institutional relationships with
communities for future collaboration. Students will work in small groups
studying the history, culture, language, economy and politics of the
communities they plan to visit during IAP to understand the context within
which their particular technological innovations must be embedded.
Graduate students taking the course for graduate credit will select a
technology and/or an implementation strategy within a community organization
and perform in-depth research and analysis to prepare a case study on the
topic.

***** Course Goals *****
    * Gain awareness of communities in the developing world and the technical
      challenges they face
    * Learn about appropriate technologies for developing communities, their
      impact, and how they can be conceived, designed and implemented
    * Understand the role MIT can play in helping and advancing developing
      communities throughout the world
    * Learn the hands-on skills required to implement selected development
      projects
    * Gain exposure to the culture, history, economic and developmental state
      of the host countries
    * Work with community organizations to prepare projects for the IAP
      fieldtrips

[Amazon_logo] Smillie, Ian. Mastering the Machine Revisited: Poverty, Aid and
Technology. Practical Action, 2000. ISBN: 9781853395147.
Readings in this book will be supplemented by additional papers, book chapters,
websites and films.
***** Grading *****
This is a twelve-unit class: four hours and a half each week will be spent in
class, two hours per week will be spent in project team meetings and the
remaining five hours will be spent working on readings, homework, and
developing the field projects. Because much of the work for this class will be
done during class time, attendance is essential. Students missing a class
meeting should contact the TAs to make up the work. No more than two unexcused
absences are allowed. This class is graded on an A/B/C/F basis; furthermore, it
is a class where your work is impacting the lives of people around the world
and we expect an appropriate level of commitment.
