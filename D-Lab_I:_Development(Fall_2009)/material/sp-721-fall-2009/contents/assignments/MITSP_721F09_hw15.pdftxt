so  your  assignment  is  to  experience  it  directly.    For  the  next week, 
limit  your  spending  to  $2  per  day.  Try  to  minimize  your  reliance  on 
pre-existing resources (such as using food that is in the pantry, eating your 
room-mates leftovers etc.). 

While  it  is  true  that  the  cost  of  living  is  higher  here  in  the US,  you will  also  have  access  to  re-
sources  that  are  unavailable  to  most  citizens  in  developing  countries  that  you  do  not  have  to 
pay for on a daily basis (shuttle bus service to your dorm or fraternity, free access to computers, 
drinking fountains that provide safe water, central heating). 

Write a one-page paper on your experience.
