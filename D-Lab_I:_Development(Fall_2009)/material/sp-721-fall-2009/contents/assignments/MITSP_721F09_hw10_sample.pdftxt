This  form will  allow  the  D-Lab  staff  to  provide  feedback  and  help  you  prepare  for  your 
project.  You can download an electronic version from the D-Lab website. You should fill 
in  a  form  for  each  project  you  are working  on,  but  only  one  of  them will  be  turned  in  to 
be graded. 

Name: Amy Smith 
Country: Ghana 
Project Title: Cassava Grater 

Describe the need that your project is intended to address. 

-

- Reduces the labor necessary to grate cassava 
Increases  throughput  and  therefore  decreases  the  time  needed  to  grate  the 
cassava 
- Provides a ready source of grated cassava to be used in preparing the binder 
for making charcoal 
- Adapt  an  appropriate  technology  to  be  made  with  locally  available  materials 
and suit local capabilities and needs 

What are the goals of your project? 

- To identify someone who can build and repair the grater 
- To build a prototype grater 
- To test the grater in Asampu and New Longoro to get user feedback 
- To investigate mechanisms for financing the grater 
- To determine a strategy for implementing and installing the grater in the 
community. 

Describe how  the project will work. What steps will you need  to take, and  in what 
sequence?  Who  will  be  helping  with  this  project?  How  will  your  time  be 
organized?  What  preparation  do  you  need  to  do?  Who  do  you  need  to  contact, 
and when? Estimate the time you will spend on the different steps. 

Prior  to  the  trip,  I  will  communicate  with  our  community  partners  to  identify  possible 
manufacturers  of  the  grater,  preferable  in  Offuman  or  Bamboi  so  that  transportation  to 
the  manufacturer  will  be  simplified,  however  it  may  be  necessary  to  work  with  a  metal 
worker  in  one  of  the  larger  towns  (Techiman,  Sunyani  or  Wenchi). 
I  will  also  work 
closely  with  Somin  Lee,  who  was  on  the  2.009  team  that  developed  the  grater,  to 
discuss  possible  design  improvements  and  to  finalize  the  drawings  necessary  for 
making  the  grater.  I  will  prepare  documentation  of  the  grater  including  pictures  of  the 
current  prototype.  I  will  pack  up  the  parts  of  the  grater  that  we  will  bring  with  us  (the 
tooling  for  making  the  grating  sheets  and  the  mold  for  casting  the  flywheel)  and 
familiarize  myself  with  how  these  were  made.  Upon  arriving  in  Offuman,  I  will  contact 
the manufacturer that we identified in order to start the production of the prototype.  I will 

also  locate a source of cement so  that  the community can help cast  the  flywheel.  I will 
also  need  to  find  a  tailor  who  could  sew  the  seat.  I  will  also  need  to  work  with  Pastor 
George  and  the  Chief  in  Asampu  to  discuss  funding/financing  for  the  grater  and  to 
determine  how  it will  be  usedâ€”owned  by  an  individual  who  creates  a micro-enterprise, 
owned by the school to raise money for supporting programs, etc. 

I  estimate  that  it  will  take  about  a  week  to  make  the  prototype,  and  then  a  couple  of 
days  for  the  community  to  cast  the  flywheel.  We  will  run  field  tests  and  interviews  on 
three  successive  days,  and  then  follow  up  about  a  week  later  to  get  additional  input. 
Following this input, we will meet with community leaders to discuss the  implementation 
plan and  the opportunities  for  expansion  into other  villages.  We will  also meet with  the 
manufacturer to discuss the market potential for the grater. 

What are the benefits of your project?  Who will benefit from your project and 
how? 

The  cassava  grater  is  a  labor-saving  device  that  will  benefit  the  village  women  in 
Asampu  and  New  Longoro  by  providing  a  means  to  quickly  and  more  easily  produce 
grated  cassava,  both  for  human  consumption  and  for  producing  binder  for  making 
charcoal out of agricultural waste. 

It  will  also  eventually  provide  an  income  generating  opportunity  for  those  producing 
cassava graters. 

How will you assess the success of your project? 

Initially, we will  get  feedback on  the device  through  interviews with potential  users.  We 
will also leave behind a follow-up survey to track the use of the grater and get additional 
user input. 

What  key  pieces  of  equipment  or  materials  that  you  will  need  for  this  project.
