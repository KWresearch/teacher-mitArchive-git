Intermediate Technology 
Excerpts from 
Small is Beautiful, Economics as if People Mattered 
E.F. Schumacher, 1973 

"In  many  places  in  the  world  today  the  poor  are  getting  poorer  while  the  rich  are 
getting  richer,  and  the  established  processes  of  foreign  aid  and  development  planning 
appear  to be unable  to overcome  this  tendency.  In  fact,  they often seem to promote  it, 
for  it  is always easier  to help  those who can help  themselves  than  to help  the helpless...."

The Condition of the Poor 

"What  is  the  typical  condition  of  the  poor  in  most  of  the  so-called  developing
