The sector paper will be due on December 2, 2009, with a brief outline  due on November 16, 
2009.  Here's the description of the assignment: 

Write a five-page paper (double-spaced, not including figures, tables  or pictures) describing the 
current state of affairs in your country in one of the sectors that we have studied  in class: 
Agriculture 
· 
Education 
· 
Energy 
· 
· 
Environment 
Health 
· 
Informat ion Techno logy 
· 
· 
Manufacturing 
Micro-finance & Micro-enterprise 
· 
· 
Water and Sanitat ion 

Confer with your team-mates and team leaders so that  you don't all choose the same topic.  You 
should turn in a brief outline on November 16 to your trip  leader so that your they can give some 
feedback before the paper is due on December 2, 2009 

In the paper, you should be sure to assess the current situation and  discuss projects that are 
happening  in that sector.  You may choose to focus on a sub-sector (for example: grain 
production and processing rather than all o f agriculture, AIDS rather than all health issues, or 
wind energy rather than all o f energy).  You should also  look at techno logies that are being used 
in other parts of the world that could be applied  in your country.  Your paper should provide a 
concise summary o f the sector (or sub-sector) you choose and provide useful background 
informat ion for field projects in that sector. 

Note:  You may chose to write about a sector related to the projects you will be submitt ing 
proposals for, however your sector paper should be far broader in scope and take a deeper look at 
current and possible techno logy applicat ion within that sector.
