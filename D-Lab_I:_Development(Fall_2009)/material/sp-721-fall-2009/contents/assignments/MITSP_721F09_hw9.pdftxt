You  are  in  charge  of  designing  a  solar  panel  installation  for  a  rural  health  post.  The 
requirements for the given location are as follows: 
•	 There is a 220W  freezer that needs to run 24/7 
•	 The  health  post  is  open  until  9pm,  and,  on  average,  they  have  to  turn  the  lights  on 
from  6pm  until  they  close.  Given  their  needs,  it  seems  that  the  most  adequate 
installation would be 2 fluorescent lights of 15W each. 
•	 They  have  an  amateur  radio  to  communicate  with  the  clinic  in  the  city,  that 
consumes 40W , and it is usually on for two hours every day. 
•	 The health post is staffed every day of the year. 

1. Calculate the average daily energy consumption at the health post. 

2.  The health post  is  located  in  a  region  that  receives  an average  of  eight hours  of  sun 
per  day  year  round,  and  one  can  assume  a  solar  irradiance  of  1,000  W /m2.  How 
many  panels  will  need  to  be  installed  to  satisfy  the  energy  demands  of  the  health 
post given the following data? 
• The available solar panels have an efficiency of 12.5%, and a surface of 0.6 m2 
• The charge controller has an efficiency of 80% 
• Since  all  items  in  the  health  post  run  of  AC,  an  inverter  is  needed.  The  inverter 
has an efficiency of 80% 
• The batteries are 90% efficient in storing energy 
• For  the  purpose  of  this  exercise,  only  consider  the  efficiencies  outlined  above, 
and disregard any other possible efficiencies in the system. 

3.	 How many deep cycle 12 V batteries capable of providing 100 Ah each would be 
needed for the system to withstand a 3 day blackout? 

4.	 Calculate the total  amount of energy generated over  the  lifetime of a solar panel  (30 
years)  for  the  system  designed  in  question  2  (hint:  note  that  the  energy  generated 
will be slightly higher than the energy requirements for the health post). 

5.	 Assume that each battery costs $100, and has a useful battery life of 3 years for  this 
type  of  applications.  Assume  also  that  each  solar  panel  costs  $250,  and  has  a  life 
expectancy  of  30  years.  Calculate  the  cost  of  kWh  for  the  system  considering  the 
entire lifespan of the solar panels. 

6.	 Compare  the  result  above with  the  cost of kWh  in Massachusetts  (data  provided  by 
NSTAR  for  residential  customers  for  the  last quarter  of 2009:  9.219  cents/kWh) and 
the country where you will be traveling (hint: look up rates for capital city provided by 
local  power  company.  If  hard  to  find,  look  up  neighboring  countries).  Reflect  on 
these  numbers,  and  suggest  what  your  recommendations  would  be  to  bring  costs 
down, and make this implementation more cost-effective.
