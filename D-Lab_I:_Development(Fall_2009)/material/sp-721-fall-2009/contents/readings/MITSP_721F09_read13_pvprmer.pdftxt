electricity.  For  the  latter  technol-
ogy, the medium is in the form of photovoltaic cells.

Sunshine reaches the ear th as radiation, providing 1367 W/
2m  of energy, composed of millions of high energy par ticles 
called photons. Roughly 25% of this energy is immediately 
lost  going  through  the  atmosphere,  but  the  rest  hits  ear th 
as  solar  radiation,  either  direct  (straight  focused  rays)  or 
dif fused (reﬂ ected by the atmosphere). On cloudy days, up 
to  100%  of  this  radiation  is  dif fused,  causing  solar  panels 
to  lose  about  80%  of  their  power.  The  amount  of  sunlight 
actually striking a sur face is referred to as solar irradiance, 
which meteorologists measure  to  determine  if  a  par ticular 
area  is  well-suited  for  solar  electricity.  For  most  of  sub-
Saharan Africa, this amount is sizable, with anywhere from 
3 -8 hours a day of prime solar irradiance (over 1000 W/m2). 
For example, Uganda averages around 4.5 kwh /m2 per day, 
and Botswana averages around 6.1 kwh /m2 per day.

If this power source could be conver ted to electricity with no 
loss,  the  potential  is  amazing.    In  just  one meter  squared, 
Uganda could have 108W daily and Botswana 146W. If you 
factor in the entire ear th, in just one hour 1.2*1017 W of solar 
power is produced: enough to supply the ear th for an entire 
year.  However,  photovoltaic  systems  do  have  signiﬁ cant 
losses—most panels operate with an efﬁ ciency of less that 
15% ,  and  there  are  fur ther  losses  in  other  components  of 
the system.  Even so, photovoltaics still are a viable option 
in  areas  with  sufﬁ cient  irradiance  and  have  a  variety  of 
uses, as shown in Table 1 below:

The Three Types of Solar Cells

How Does PV Work?

In  1839,  a  nineteen  year  old  French  scientist,  Alexandre-
Edmund Becquerel, noticed electrical currents arising from 
cer tain materials when exposed  to  light. He developed his 
theory: light can cause electricity to be generated. Although 
he published his knowledge, it took some time until this was 
reﬁ ned. In the 1950s, American scientists star ted to exploit 
this  to  a  large  degree:  the  ﬁ rst  solar  cell  on  a  satellite, 
Vanguard I, occurred in 1958. Today, solar cells are manu-
factured worldwide, with centers  in USA, Germany, Spain, 
Italy, Japan, Brazil and India.

The  solar  cells  most  appropriate  for  use  in  developing 
countries  are  all  based  on  silicon;  other  semi-conductors 
are used  for applications, such as satellites, where cost  is 
not  an  issue.    When  a  photon  of  incident  light  strikes  the 
silicon, it can transfer its energy to an electron.  If a load is 
connected  to  this  (such as a wire), electrons ﬂ ow out as a 
current. The stronger the light, the more electrons will ﬂ ow 
and the larger the generated current.

There are three main types of solar cells that are used:

monocrystalline  -  cells  cut  from  single  crystals  of  silicon. 
11-18% efﬁ ciency, but most expensive. 
polycrystalline  -  cells  cut  from many  crystals  of  silicon.  8 -
11% efﬁ ciency, moderately expensive.

amorphou  - created from silicon not in crystalline form. 3 -

Each one of  these solar cells generate a potential voltage 
dif ference of ~0.5V. Thus to achieve a 12V battery, approxi-
mately 24 of them need to be placed in series.

The Battery

Unfor tunately, when  the  sun  is  shining  it  is  the  least  likely 
time for people to be using lights in their house. A medium 
of  energy  storage  is  necessary,  which  takes  the  form  of

a  battery.  Although  car  batteries  can  be  used,  it’s  much 
better to use a battery especially designed for solar electric 
systems. 

There are two main battery types: 

  -  Based  on  the  chemical  reaction 
  -  Based  on  the  chemical  reaction 
Lead  Acid  Batteries  -  Based  on  the  chemical  reaction 
s  -  Based  on  the  chemical  reaction

Lead  Acid  Batteries 
Lead  Acid  Batteri
e 
between  lead  dioxide  and  negative  lead  plate,  with  an 
electrolyte  composed  of  sulfuric  acid  and  water.  When 
charged, the lead dioxide accumulates on the positive plate 
and  the  lead on  the negative plate. The relative amount of 
sulfuric acid in the electrolyte increases, thus leading to an 
increased voltage dif ference. When discharged, the sulfuric 
acid in the battery decreases as the sulphur combines with 
lead and accumulates on the negative plate. 

Nickel-Cadmium (nicad) - Based on  the chemical reaction 
between  nickel  hydroxide  and  the  (negative)  cadmium 
hydroxide, with similar ef fects to the lead acid battery. 

The nicad batteries are more expensive and have lower ef-
ﬁciency.  In addition, they are not as robust and require strict 
adherence  to  their  recommended  charging  procedures. 
Their advantages  lie  in being  lighter and smaller.  Fur ther-
more,  they  can  be  rapidly  discharged  without  damage  to 
cells, can be left in a low state of charge, require less main-
tenance,  have  a  longer  life,  and  can  be  operated  over  a 
wider range of temperatures. 

In rural Africa, lead acid batteries are much easier to obtain. 
Among  these,  there  are  two  dif ferent  varieties:  the  deep 
discharge, or deep  cycle, which allows more energy  to be 
taken out, and the shallow discharge, such as those found 
in automotive applications. Although the former is better as 
it allows more ﬂexibility, the latter is often used because of 
its wide availability. 

The amount of charge that can be stored in a battery can be 
approximately determined by multiplying the charge current 
(I) by the amount of time the current has been applied (t), to 
get  the amount of  charge  in amp hours  (Q). To determine 
the  number  of  watt  hours  available  in  the  battery,  simply 
multiply Q by the voltage in the battery (either 12V or 24V). 

Photovoltaic Primer

Batteries  should  not  be  charged  at  a  current  higher  than 
1/10 of rated capacity. During the charging phase, 10 -30% 
of the energy is lost as heat.

Charge Controllers and Load Management

We now have the photovoltaic cells and the battery, and now 
we’re ready to connect the battery to the load (lamps, radios, 
refrigerators,  etc.).  To  ensure  that  the  energy  level  in  the 
battery remains at optimal levels, there needs to be an inter-
mediate device. For this we have charge controllers, to provide 
central point  for connecting  the  load, modules and battery 
pack; to manage the system so harvested electricity is used 
efﬁ ciently and protect the components; and to allow users to 
monitor  the  system  and  locate  potential  system  problems.

If nothing else, the charge controller should contain a junction 
box with  fuses  to account  for  large current ﬂ ow. When  the 
current ﬂ ows above a cer tain level, the metal wire inside the 
fuse will melt, forming an open circuit and stopping current 
ﬂ ow. For rural Africa, simple automotive fuses or fuse wires 
can be used. Most battery shops will stock these. It is also 
helpful  to  have  a  main  circuit  switch,  thus  ensuring  that  
forgotten loads will not drain the battery.

Lamps and Appliances

Most  lamps  and  other  appliances  are  built  in Africa  to  run 
of f  of  the  standard  240V  AC.  If  directly  plugged  into  the 
12V  DC,  there  will  be  problems,  such  as  sparks  and  the 
destruction of the lamp or the battery will discharge without 
powering  the  appliance.    There  are  appliances  that  are 
designed to run of f 12VDC, or an inver ter must be used to 
conver t from direct current to alternating current.

Lamps

designed  over  a  century  ago.  The  bulb  is  ﬁ lled  with  an 
iner t gas, and a  thin  tungsten wire  (the  ﬁ lament)  conducts 
electric. When electric passes over  the ﬁ lament,  the resis-
tance causes the wire to heat up to 3000 degrees Celsius, 
giving of f heat and  light. These can be designed to run of f 
of 12V.   Typically about 90% of  the energy  is  lost as heat, 
which leads to low lighting efﬁ ciency.

The installation of charge controller 
and circuit breaker box in a PV system

While it is possible to not use a charge 
controller, extra care must be  taken  to 
avoid  deep  discharge  and  destroying 
components.

1. Checking the battery state regularly. 
Watch for signs: if the lights ﬂ icker, the 
battery is getting low.

2. Calculate how much energy is going 
into  the  battery  and  adjust  energy 
usage.

3.  Limit  appliances  when  battery 
charge is low.

4. Every  two months  (or more of ten  in 
cloudy weather), choose battery using 
alternative means.

As  current  passes  through  the  lamp,  the  vapor  gives  of f 
UV  rays,  which  make  contact  with  a  coating  of  phospho-
rous on  the  inside of  the  lamp, causing  light  to be emitted. 
These  lamps are 10 -20  times more expensive  than  incan-
descents, but are about  four  times as energy efﬁ cient and 
have a much  longer  life. These must operate between 70 -
100V AC, and so require an inver ter to increase the voltage 
and change the current from DC to AC (thus losing 10 -15% 
of the electricity in the process). 

light emitting diodes (LEDs) are made from layers of silicon 
and  seeded  with  atoms  of  phosphorus,  or  germanium, 
arsenic  and  other  rare-ear th  elements.  A  cheap  plastic 
reﬂ ector  focuses  the  light  into  a  beam  that  can  be  narrow 
and  very  bright,  or  wide  and  dif fuse.    Electricity  ﬂ owing 
through the diode is directly conver ted to light, without heat.  
Technical advances have greatly  improved  the quality and 
reliability  of  LEDs  since  they  were  invented  in  the  1960s, 
making them much brighter and more efﬁ cient and suitable 
for home lighting applications.

Wirings and Fittings
The amount of current  that can ﬂ ow  through a wire  is akin 
to  the  amount  of  water  that  can  ﬂ ow  through  a  pipe:  the 
greater  the  diameter,  the  more  current  that  can  ﬂ ow.  As 
240V AC needs  little current due to the high voltage, a 1.0 
or 1.5 mm2 wire is adequate (21 - 23 AWG). For a 12V DC, 
use at  least 2.5 mm2  (19 AWG) with a separate black wire 
wrapped around for grounding. 

This  is what  a  PV  system  you might  ﬁ nd 
in a developing country (in this case Haiti) 
may  look  like.    Without  any  mounting 
structure  whatsoever,  this  system  is  vul-
nerable to not only thef t, but also to wind 
and rain.  Your goals should be set much 
higher.

Overview of the Science and Application of PV Systems 

Sockets 
A  low-voltage,  high  current  DC  socket  is  recommended 
for  solar  installations,  although  the  standard  240V  AC  is 
commonly used.  If  the  latter  is used,  the energy efﬁciency 
is not nearly as high. 

Connections 
A terminal strip (insulated screw-down wire clamps used to 
connect wires together) should be used. Strip the insulated 
ends of the wire 1.5 -1 cm from the end. Twist the end, pref-
erably with a crimp tool, and wrap around the clamp before 
screwing it down. When ﬁnished, inspect all connections to 
ensure that there are no loose wires. 

Grounding 
To protect against electric shocks and damage to the system 
from lightning, the system must be grounded to provide an 
easy path for electricity to travel. Attach a wire leading from 
metal  casings  of  all  valuable  appliances  or  modules  to  a 
rod driven into the ground. 

Maximum Wire Runs 
As the distance from the battery to the appliances increase, 
the amount of voltage lost through the wire will increase as 
well.  To  ensure  this  doesn’t  happen,  ensure  all  wires  are 
less than 15 meters and carry no more than 4 amps. 

Planning your system 

Now  that you know all  the components you need,  it’s  time 
to actually plan your system.

 1. Determine how much power you need.
 2. Electric energy demand will probably grow, so plan 

for expansion.

 3. Consider alternatives carefully. 
4. Visit another system before installing your own.
 5. Draw a scale diagram of the ﬂoor plan. 
6. Keep your system as simple as possible.
 7. Shop around for dif ferent equipment. 
8. Estimate load carefully. 

Determine  daily  system  energy  requirements  by  listing  all 
of  your appliances and multiplying  their  individual wattage 
by  the  number  of  hours  to  be  used  daily.  Total  this  up  to 
determine your daily requirements. 

Unfor tunately, thef t of solar panels can 
and does occur. To decrease this risk, 
position  the  panel as high as possible 
and use a steel mount. Place it as close 
to your house as possible so you will be 
aler ted  if anyone  is near  it. Downward 
facing spikes can be a deterrent.

2. Check electroly te levels in each 
cell. Replace water lost during 
gassing with de-ionized water. 
Plates should always be below level 
of electroly te. Rainwater/
 homemade distilled water can be 
used. 
3. Clean top of battery periodically. 
4. Clean terminals and contacts.
 Apply petroleum jelly or grease to 
terminals to prevent corrosion but 
be careful not to shor t the battery 
terminals. 
5. Give battery occasional equalizing 
charges to mix up electroly te. 

Wiring - Annually, ensure that all wires 
are  still  in  good  working  condition, 
non-frayed  and  that  all  connections 
are attached.

To  determine  the  size  of  the  PV  array,  calculate  the  solar 
energy  available  by  using  records  from  meteorological 
stations  for  the  area.  Check  which  month  has  the  lowest 
mean  daily  irradiance,  and  pick  the module  that  will meet 
your  energy  requirements  based  on  this  month.  Dividing 
your  total  load  by  the  efﬁciencies  of  the  batteries,  charge 
controllers and  inver ters will give you  the power you need 
from the array. 

Other factors:
   1. Can you charge the battery using other methods? Do 

       you need it year-round?

   2. Will modules be mounted or tracking (panel moves  

      following the sun)? If tracking, you will get 20% more 

      efﬁciency.


Assignment Questions 

1. Using  the  values  in Table 3 at  the  right, determine  your 
average  daily  energy  consumption  (in  kWh).  For  this  as-
signment,  you  can  take  into  account  only  the  electricity 
that  you  use,  though  you  should  be  aware  that  there  are 
additional  energy  expenditures  in  terms  of  transpor tation, 
manufacturing  processes  to  make  the  products  that  you 
use, etc.
