Tech Brief 

Drip  irrigation  is  one 
the  most  efﬁcient 
of 
methods  of 
irrigation— 
the water drips directly onto 
the 
losses 
soil,  preventing 
due to evaporation or run-of f, and 
if  the  ﬂow  rates  are  set  correctly,  water  losses  due  to 
deep percolation (that is, penetrating the soil below the 
root  system  and  ﬂowing  into  the  water  table)  can  be 
minimized.  This  provides  a  moist  environment  for  the 
roots which optimizes growth, while keeping the rest of 
the  plant  relatively  dry,  which  helps  prevent  diseases. 
Fur thermore, with drip systems, you can control where 
the  water  is  applied,  which  increases  water  efﬁciency 
and  helps  minimize  weed  growth.  Drip  irrigations 
systems are typically about 90% efﬁcient, as compared 
to  sprinkler  systems  which  are  about  75%  efﬁcient. 
Water  savings  can be as high as 50% and  crop  yields 
can be increased by up to 40% .

Adapted from “Crop Production Guidelines: Drip Irrigation” by H. Valenzuela 
*Based on data gathered in Hoolehua, Hawaii, USA 

Conventional  drip  irrigation  systems  cost  between 
$1,200  and  $3,000  per  hectare  (10,000  m2),  which 
makes  them  inaccessible  to small-scale  farmers  in de-
veloping countries.  The low-cost drip systems available 
from  International  Development  Enterprises  cost  less 
than $500 per hectare and are available  in a variety of 
sizes,  ranging  from  the  home  garden  kit,  which  costs 
only $2.50 and covers a plot of 20 m2, to a large custom 
system  that costs $45  for 1,000 m2.  Designed with af-
fordability as the driving factor, the kits uses thin-walled 
ﬂat plastic tubing and simple knotted-tube emitters and 
will last 1 to 2 years.
