Shoes: 
•	 Tevas (or other rugged sandals)-- very handy for walking around in the hot weather 
•	 Nice shoes or sandals-- for when you are dressing up for presentations 
•	 Sneakers for playing soccer or other games with the kids. 
General  Clothes.  Think  dark  colors  or  things  that  don’t  show  the  dirt  easily!  Light-colored 
clothes look dirty pretty quickly. 
•	 Skirts/dresses-- these are important to have when working in the villages (for women), going 
to community meetings, church, etc. 
•	 Slacks--  it  is  good  for  men  to  bring  at  least  one  pair  of  nice  (but  comfortable)  slacks  for 
community meetings, church etc. 
•	 Warm  clothes--  you  won’t  need  much,  but  a  thin  fleece  may  be  handy  in  the  evenings,  
something waterproof is a good idea too. 
•	 Shorts-- good for relaxing at night, but not appropriate for travel or working. Very few people 
wear shorts out of the house. 
•	 Swimsuit—it doesn’t take much space, and is nice to have in case there’s an opportunity. 
•	 Some  kind  of  hat--  it's  hot  this  time  of  year  and  the  sun  can  be  brutal.  A  hat  can  also  be 
useful in keeping the dust out of your face when riding in the back of a pick-up truck. 
Toiletries:

Your  favorite  toiletries  will  be  hard  to  find,  so  if  you  are  particular  about  the  brands  you  use,

bring  enough  for  the  trip.  Standard  toiletries  (soap,  tooth  paste,  etc.)  are  easily  available.  You

may also want to bring packets of tissues for when toilet paper is in short supply.

Household supplies: 
•	 Sheets--  a  single,  colored  sheet  (2m  x  1m)  can  be  helpful  in  places  where  the  bed  looks  
sketchy.  You  probably  don’t  need  to  bring  a  sleeping  bag,  though  you  could  bring  a  small 
fleece blanket. 
•	 Towels--  these are bulky,  you  can probably get by with a  smaller one  than  you are used  to.  
Kikois/Kanga  cloths  are  a  good  alternative.  You  can  buy  these  locally  or  make  them  from 
your own cloth. 
•	 Camping  pad--  useful  for  when  you  are  crashing  on  someone’s  floor,  also  can  make  the  
rough roads a  little more bearable when you’re  in the back of a truck.  But they are bulky, so 
we can probably make do with just one or two for the team. 
•	 Mosquito  net--D-Lab  provides  these,  you  should  bring  one  along  to  help  prevent  mosquito 
bites (and malaria). 
•	 Mosquito repellent-- always a good idea. 
•	 Power converter/adapter plugs-- if you are bringing along things that need to be charged. 
•	 Shaving/vanity  mirror--  useful  for  putting  in  contact  lenses.  You  can  also  put  it  behind  a  
candle or lantern to get a little more light at night. 
•	 Drain plug-- useful for turning a sink into a washtub. 
•	 Clothesline-- handy for drying clothes that you’ve washed by hand.  Bring clothespins too! 

Handy travel gear: 
•	 Money belt, pouch or some other way to be discreet with your money. 
•	 A dictionary or phrasebook (or both) 
•	 Photocopies  of  all  important  documents  (passport,  WHO  card,  license,  etc),  also  leave  a 
copy at home 

•	 Small flashlight with a couple spare batteries-- useful for finding the latrine at night, checking 
out  scary  noises  in  the  bedroom,  etc.  If  you  bring  a  small  LED  light,  be  sure  it  has  an  on 
switch, not just a squeeze button. 
Leatherman/pocket knife-- but remember that this should go in your checked bag. 
•	
•	 Water filter and  iodine drops-- we provide at  least one set  for every  team, so you don’t need  
to bring your own unless you want to. 
•	 A couple 1-liter water bottles-- very useful.   You may  find  that you need  to drink an awful  lot 
of water.  They are also good for filtering water. 
•	 Gatorade powder and/or oral rehydration salts-- for days when you get really dehydrated. 
•	 Aspirin/Ibuprofin-- to help with dehydration (and other) headaches.  
•	 Camera  and  plenty  of memory  cards,  or more  film  that  you  thought  possible,  if  you  are  not 
using digital. 
•	 Ear plugs-- invaluable for long plane rides, bus trips, noisy lounges, snoring room-mates etc 
•	 Hand  wipes--  a  couple  individually  wrapped  wipes  can  come  be  very  useful  if  you  need  to 
put contact lenses in or want to clean your hands before eating while on the road 
•	 Anti-bacterial hand-stuff-- useful for cleaning your hands before you eat. 
•	 Handkerchief  or  bandana--  millions  of  uses,  including  face  mask,  washcloth,  bath  towel, 
signal flag, sweat band, emergency hat, water filter.  Bring a few. 
•	 First aid kit-- we'll bring a  large kit  for  the  team, but everyone ought  to have a  few bandages  
and first aid cream with them for their own use. 
•	 Medication-- bring twice as much as you need and divide it up into different bags so that you 
are okay in case a bag gets lost or stolen. 
•	 Snacks--  it's  sometimes nice  to have a power bar  (or  something) on  really  long  rides.  If  you  
have special dietary needs, you should bring extra, for when there nothing else you can eat.  
Packing: 
•	 Medium-sized  backpack  with  waist  strap  and  heavy-duty  zippers  or  a  medium-sized 
suitcase with wheels. You’ll need  to  fit  your personal supplies  in  one  bag;  the  other bag will 
be for team research supplies. 
•	 Fanny pack-- a great way  to  keep  cameras, notebooks,  tools, etc handy, and useful  for day  
hikes (doesn’t get as hot as a backpack). 
•	 Zipper locks or zip ties-- can be an easy way to keep your things secure. 
•	 Nylon  packing  straps--  these  are  amazingly  useful  for  strapping  stuff  onto  your  backpack.  
Find the kind with plastic buckles, so you can cinch them tight rather than tying them. 
•	 Zip-loc  bags--  really  handy  for  protecting  things  from  dust  and  water;  also  useful  for  
collecting  small  things.  Large  trash  bags  can  be  useful  for  keeping  things  dry  in  the  rainy 
season (or for transporting messy things back home). 
Entertainment: 
•	 Books--  talk  to your  team  to see  if you can  find a  few books  that you’ll want  to share,  it’ll be  
less to pack and useful when you run out of other discussion topics. 
Journal--  potentially  one  of  the  most  valuable  souvenirs  from  your  experience.  If  you  can  
find carbon paper, you can use the letters that you write as part of your journal. 
•	 Art  supplies,  origami  paper--  a  great  way  to  get  to  know  local  kids  (and  adults)  when  you 
aren’t working. 
•	 Games--  learning  the  local  card  games  is  another  great  way  to  integrate  into  the  society;  if  
you bring along your own deck, someone will teach you to play. It’s also nice to have games 
that the team can play on long journeys, or when waiting around. 
•	 Pictures from home-- people will enjoy learning about your home and family. 
Professional Supplies:

  Calculator-- often very handy, but best to bring one that you can leave behind

  Gifts for the heads of the organizations that you are working with and for your hosts

  Tool box-- make no assumptions about what we’ll be able to find over there.
