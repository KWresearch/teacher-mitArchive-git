Appropriate Toilets for Developing Countries 
Amy Deora, RPCV—Jamaica 

Technically,  “latrine”  is  the  word  used  for  any  non-water  toilet.  However,  latrine  is 
considered  a  “dirty  word”  in  some  places,  so  it’s  better  to  call  what  you  are  building  a 
toilet. 

2 billion people don’t have a toilet.  What do they do? 
•	 Go outside. Some common areas used for these purpose are fields used to grow 
crops or rivers. Sometimes there is an established area that acts as a community 
toilet. 
•	 Use a “bucket toilet” inside the house and then dump it somewhere. 
•	 Use a neighbor’s toilet when they can.  
•	 Use a plastic bag or container and then dispose of it in a trash heap. 

Why do people still not have adequate sanitation? 
It’s not totally a  lack of money. Many governments and NGOs have spent  lots of money 
building toilets for the poor. 

•	

As many as half of the toilets built do not get used. Why? 
If  you  are  used  to  going  outside  in  the  open  air,  a  smelly  toilet  is  not  an  enticing 
option. 
•	 Some  technologies  are  hard  to  maintain,  and  will  fail  when  there’s  no 
money/expertise for maintenance. 
•	 The toilet starts to smell and the neighbors start to complain. 
•	 Some  toilets  have  usage  requirements  that  are  difficult  for  people  to  understand 
or follow. 
•	 Toilets are vandalized or are not used due to conflicts in the community. 
•	 The type of toilet is unusual and people are uncomfortable using it. 
In some places going out to relieve yourself is a social ritual.  
•	
If a toilet is better than the house someone lives in, he might tear down your toilet 
•	
and use the materials to improve his house. 
•	 The pit/vault/septic tank fills up and there’s no way to empty it.  
•	 Outdoor  toilets are  seen  to be  inferior  to  flush  toilets,  so people would  rather not 
have the physical evidence of using an outdoor toilet near their house. 

•	 Toilets  can  be  dark  and  scary  places.  Some  people  may  be  afraid  of  their 
children  falling  in  toilets, criminals hiding  in  them, or women  leaving  the house  to 
use them. 

As you can see,  this  is a  long  list, and  it  is only a partial  list of problems  that may arise. 
The general  idea here  is  that sanitation projects are not simply a matter of building 
toilets.  You  could  build  great  toilets,  using  the  best  technology,  and  they  still  could  lay 
around  useless  once  you’ve  gone. Getting  people  to  use  the  facilities  and  change  their 
behaviors  is  not  something  that  happens  overnight,  and  takes  a  long  and  concerted 
effort in a community.  

Types of toilets 

Dry: 
•	  Pit toilet 
•	 Ventilated  improved  pit  (VIP)  toilet  

(“improved”  is  code  for  “has  a  vent  

pipe”) 

•	  Ventilated 
improved  double  pit 
(VIDP) toilet: (dehydrating system)  

o	 sealed or unsealed 
o	  passive 
dehydrating 
active composting 
•	  Composting toilet 

or 

Design factors of the basic toilet 

Waterborne: 
•  Soakaway pit 
•  Septic tank 
•  Hookup 
to  a  central  sewage 
plant. 


Waterborne  toilets  can  be  “pour  flush” 
(you  throw a bucket of water down  them 
to flush) or mechanical flush 

1. Which basic type of toilet best suits the community? 
•	 Waterborne or dry? (partly cultural, part technical)  
o	 Are people washers (waterborne better) or wipers (dry is probably the best 
option)? 
o	 What’s  the  site  like? Where  is  the  nearest water  source? How  high  is  the 
water  table?  (Water  intrusion  would  be  a  problem  if  the  toilet  is  designed 
to be dry.) 
o	 What are  the soil conditions  like? (Loose soils make  for unstable pits. You 
may need a casing for the pit.) 
o	 How much room is there around people’s homes? 
o	 How  much  money  does  the  community  have/can  they  get  from  donors? 
Are there people trained to maintain complicated systems? 
The only situations in which you would encourage a water-based solution would be if 
people  use water  to  clean  themselves  after  using  the  toilet,  or  in  a more  developed 
community that has the money and expertise to maintain a water-based solution and 
is opposed to traditional pit latrines. 
•	 Are  you  going  to  actively  compost  the  waste,  or  passively  dehydrate  it? 
(mainly technical, partly cultural)  
o	 What is the climate like? 

o	 What’s  the  attitude  toward  human  waste?  Do  people  use  waste  for 
fertilizer? Would they be open to using composted human waste? 
o	 What do people grow in the area? 
o	 What  diseases  are  endemic  in  the  area? What  is  health  risk  be  if  people 
handle waste improperly?  
o  How are the vaults going to be emptied? Who is going to empty them? 
Passive  dehydrating  systems  are  somewhat  harder  to  maintain  than  regular  pit 
toilets,  but  are  environmentally  better,  and  often  (but  not  always)  less  smelly. 
Composting toilets are the hardest to maintain, but provide valuable compost and 
have the potential to be very odor-free. 
2. What kind of “options” does the community want for its toilet? 
•	 Seat (totally cultural) 
o	 Do people like to sit or squat? 
•	 Urine separation (mainly technical, partially cultural) 
o	 What to do with the urine after separating it 
  Separate  soakaway  pit:  remember  urine  can  eat  away  at  concrete 
over time. 
  Save for fertilizer: will people use it? 
o	 How to separate urine
  Behavior – put a separate urinal within or outside the toilet
  urine-separating seat  
  mesh toilet bottom or sloped toilet bottom leading to a pipe 
•	 Type and size of vault (technical) 
o	 Underground vs. aboveground vault?
	 Does  the  area  flood?  Is  the  soil  unstable,  or  solid  rock?  Is  there 
more solar heat to “cook” the compost aboveground? 
o	 How big should the vault/vaults be?

  How many people will use the toilet?

  How long is it supposed to last?  

o	 Sealed vs. unsealed vault 
  Will groundwater contamination be a problem? 
  Where are water sources relative to the toilet? 
Is it possible to re-site the toilet if there’s a conflict? 
 
If it’s unsealed there’s potential for an “Arborloo” (plant a tree on top 
 
of  the pit after  it becomes  full; mobile superstructure moved  to new 
pit.) 
o	 What will the vaults be made of? 
  What’s available? What are soil conditions like? 
  Possibilities: plastic water drums, block, stone (unsealed) 
o	 How to open the vault
  Put a door on the vaults of an aboveground latrine
  Make the slab removable to empty an underground pit. 
•	 Ventilation (technical) 
o	 Vent pipe: How big? Made out of what?
	 Possibilities:  PVC  pipe  (expensive),  cinder  block,  bamboo,  pieces 
of plastic. 

o	 How  to  keep  out  bugs:  If  the  superstructure  is  dark  then  the  only  light  the 
flies  can  see  is  at  the  top  of  the  vent  pipe  and  they  fly  towards  the  light 
and are captured by the screen. 
o	 Which  way  does  the  wind  blow?  Keep  smells  away  from  houses, 
neighbors, especially shops or outdoor kitchens. 
Ventilation  (both  pipe  and  siting)  is  particularly  crucial  to  pleasantness 
of your toilet, and therefore to the success of any project.  
•	 Superstructure (mainly cultural) 
o  What are local buildings like? Have a local mason design this part.  
o 
Is this a permanent structure or a temporary, emergency one? 
o  How can you incorporate the ventilation and bug-killing schemes? 
•	 Slab (technical) 
o	 What weight will it bear? 
o	 What are the vaults made out of? 
o	 Are soil conditions stable? 
o	 How can you make sure it doesn’t hold standing water? 
Best practices 

Most of the design elements of a toilet should be chosen based on the specific situation 
of each site. However, there are some best practices that you should be aware of: 

Vent Pipe: Should be at least 2” in diameter, straight (no elbow), and extend at least 18 
inches  above  the  top  of  the  superstructure.  For maximum  airflow,  the  pipe  should  start 
level with  the bottom of  the  slab  so  that no  smelly air  can get  trapped between  the part 
of  the  pipe  that  is  extended  and  the  bottom  of  the  slab.  Many  practitioners  have  lately 
been  increasing  the  diameter  of  the  vent  pipe  to  up  to  6  inches.  A  larger  vent  pipe  will 
usually  have  larger  airflow,  which  will  make  the  superstructure  maximally  odor  free. 
However,  in  my  experience,  having  a  vent  pipe  this  size  can  lead  to  smells  outside  of 
the  latrine  when  there’s  a  quick  change  of  wind  direction.  Smells  outside  of  the  latrine 
can often be more problematic than inside because outside smells affect neighbors who 
may not be getting the benefit of having the latrine. 

Flyscreen:  It  is  critical  that  the  vent  pipe  have  a  fly  screen  tightly  sealed  to  the  top.  If 
the  latrine  is dark,  flies will be attracted  to  the  sunlight  coming  through  the pipe, and  fly 
up  to  the  top.  If  the  flyscreen  is  attached,  they  can’t  get  out  and  die  up  there.  If  a 
flyscreen is not in place, they get out and land on the kids.  

Slab:  Should  be  at  least  3”  thick,  reinforced  concrete.  Many  slabs  are  not  reinforced 
because  the  area  they  cover  is  very  small  and  it  is  not  considered  necessary,  but 
because of high usage I have seen many un-reinforced slabs cave in over time. 

Vault  Size:  There  is  no  absolute  best  practice  for  this,  but  for  sealed  latrines,  one  rule 
of thumb is 0.8 m3 per person per year. Unsealed pit latrines should be at least 5 ft deep 
and  are  usually  6  to  8  feet  deep. Of  course,  always  overestimate!  In  areas  like  schools 
or  other  public  areas,  sealed  vaults may  not  be  the  best  solution  because  they may  fill 
at an unpredictable rate. 

Siting: There are usually  local building  regulations.  If you are  in an urban area, even  in 
an  informal community,  look at  these and attempt  to  follow  them as much as possible – 
you  don’t  want  a  local  official  to  have  a  good  excuse  to  tear  down  a  latrine  because  it 
isn’t within code! 
A word about concrete: there are many differing standards for the use of concrete – how 
long  it  should  cure,  what  type  of  aggregate  you  should  use,  etc.  This  will  depend  a  lot 
on climate and  local practices. Get a  local mason  to help you, and follow  local practices 
– local builders know what they are doing.

Behavior and maintenance issues 

Repairing the flyscreen: Even a small tear  in the flyscreen on the vent pipe can cause 
a huge amount of  insect  invasion. This  flyscreen material can be hard  for people  to get, 
so leave some extra on hand for after toilets are built. 

Putting  things  down  the  hole:  This  is  far  and  away  the  biggest  maintenance  issue. 
Children  in  particular  seem  to  love  to  throw  things  down  holes.  Educating  them  about 
the  new  latrine  is  crucially  important.  A  lot  of  garbage  gets  thrown  into  latrines  that 
doesn’t break down and  fills up  the pit way  too early and collects water, causing smells. 
Explain  to  women  that  they  cannot  put  sanitary  napkins  (unless  they  use  all  organic 
materials)  or  disposable  diapers  down  the  pit.  It  is  also  important  that  people 
understand  that  they  can’t  let  much  water  get  in.  This  can  be  emphasized  by  calling  it 
the “dry toilet” and reinforcing that first word.  
Composting/dehydrating  toilets  are  problematic  in  that  they  require  people  to  throw  in 
some organic material to facilitate drying/composting. Be careful how in how you explain 
this  to  people.  It  is  often  hard  to  get  people  to  identify what  is  an  organic material  and 
what  is  not.  In  developing  countries,  people  often  throw  their  inorganic  trash  on  the 
ground, and then rake everything up at the end of the day – and you don’t want them to 
throw  this  in  the  toilet.  Many  people  are  used  to  throwing  things  like  gasoline  into 
traditional pit toilets to dry them out – this is disastrous for any sealed vault system. 

Keeping the floor and seat clean: Encourage people to paint, polish, or lay down vinyl 
flooring  (surprisingly  cheap many  places)  so  that  surfaces  are  easier  to  clean. Wooden 
surfaces are particularly good breeders of germs. 

Emptying  vaults: Double  vault  systems  are  often  built with  the  idea  that  the  users will 
empty  them  when  they  fill,  but  people  are  often  intimidated  or  disgusted  by  this  task  – 
even  when  the  toilet  doesn’t  smell,  and  then  this  step  never  gets  done  and  the  toilet 
never  gets  used.  There  is  actually  evidence  that  worldwide  nearly  half  of  VIDPs  never 
get  emptied.  It  is  usually  more  realistic  to  have  a  particular  person  either  inside  or 
outside the community designated to do this for a fee.  
Even though compost that comes out of a vault should be safe, it’s not guaranteed to be 
totally  pathogen  free.  It  should  be  kept  away  from  children,  and  people  should  be  very 
careful about washing their hands after handling it   

Public  latrines:  Public  latrines  are  problematic  because  not  everyone  knows  how  to 
use  it  correctly.  If  you  put  up  a  sign  about  proper  toilet  behavior,  remember  that  many 
people will not be able to read it. 

HAND  WASHING  is  the  most  crucial  part  of  proper  sanitation.  Make  sure  people 
have an available water source and soap or ashes to wash their hands after using 
the toilet. 

What to do if you have a smelly toilet 

If  you are  in a  community  for a  short period of  time,  some of  the best  interventions  you 
can  make  are  helping  people  to  improve  their  existing  toilets,  or  to  help  them  realize 
how  some  of  their  behaviors  might  be  causing  any  of  the  odor  problems  they  are 
having. 
The  reason  that  most  toilets  are  smelly  is  because  their  contents  are  wet.  Keep  this 
concept  in  mind  when  troubleshooting  issues  –  it  might  be  as  simple  as  making  sure 
people  aren’t  cleaning  the  pit with water  or  encouraging  them  to  urinate  another  place. 
And,  after  a  really  big  rain,  the  thing  just might  smell  for  a  while,  and  there’s  not much 
you can do about it. 

Have the users pour ashes into the toilet: Ashes are one of the best odor controllers. 
This  is  usually  fairly  easy  to  do  because  in most  developing  countries,  people  cook  on 
coal  fires. Have  them pour  in a  few cups at once, and  then have  them get  into  the habit 
of  emptying  their  coal  pot  into  the  toilet  every  day.    Sawdust  is  another  good  odor-
absorber.  If  none  of  these  is  available,  put  in  anything  organic  in  that will  absorb  some 
of the moisture. Remember the “fine balance” issue above.  

Add/Extend  the vent pipe: Adding a  vent pipe  to an existing  latrine with no  ventilation 
can make  an  incredible  difference  in  odor.  For  a  toilet  that  already  has  a  vent  pipe,  try 
attaching additional length of the vent pipe above the superstructure, to help carry odors 
further  away  –  I  have  seen  pipes  extending  up  to  seven  feet  above  the  roof.    This  can 
make a huge difference. 

Paint  it black: By  painting  the  vent  pipe  or  the  vaults  black  or  by  adding  a  black metal 
panel, you can get a surprising  increase  in temperature that  in the case of the vent pipe 

will  help  suck  air  up  the  pipe,  and  in  the  case  of  the  vaults  will  help  speed  the 
dehydration process.
