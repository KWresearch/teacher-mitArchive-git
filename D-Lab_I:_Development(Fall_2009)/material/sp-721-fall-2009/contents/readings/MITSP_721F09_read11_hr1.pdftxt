Planting the Rights Seed: 
A human rights perspective on

agriculture trade and the WTO


I 

Introduction 

Around 70% of the world’s poorest people live in rural areas and are dependent on agriculture 
for their income, food supply and livelihoods.1  If we are to improve the lot of the majority of 
the poorest people in the world then we must build up and promote the rural sector, putting 
people, rather than production, at the centre of agricultural policies. 
This Backgrounder examines the global agriculture system from a human rights perspec­
tive.  It  explores  the  link  between  the  rural  sector,  agricultural  trade,  and  the  realization  of 
human  rights.  In so doing  it highlights  the  limitations of  the agriculture  trade  liberalization 
agenda  that  currently dominates policy-making,  including  in  the World Trade Organization 
(WTO). This Backgrounder suggests ways to approach the global agricultural trading system 
with a view to making it more responsive to human needs. 
Human rights law provides tools that can help def ine an agriculture system that guarantees 
human rights for all. Human rights are particularly relevant 
because  most  States,  including  all WTO Members,  have 
ratif ied  at  least  one  of  the  international  human  rights  in-
struments,  thereby  committing  themselves  to  the  realiza-
tion of human rights.

II  The Rural Sector, Food Systems 
and Trade Liberalization 

If we intend to improve people’s livelihoods then we have 
to focus on the rural sector. Around 2.5 billion people live 
in  rural  areas  and  are  engaged  in  agricultural  production 
as a source of  livelihood.2  Many of  these are small-scale, 
subsistence  farmers,  and  the  vast  majority  produce  food 
for  local  consumption. Agriculture  is  thus  an  activity  of 
central importance, not only for producing and consuming 
food but  also  for broader  elements of  livelihoods  includ-
ing culture and tradition. Developing the farm sector, par-
ticularly  in  countries  where  a  high  percentage  of  the 
population is engaged in agriculture, is an effective way to

generate employment and reduce poverty, as well as to in-
crease levels of health, nutrition and education.

Yet agricultural policies today largely focus on increasing production and trade, rather than 
on the livelihoods of food producers. These aim at liberalization of the agriculture sector, and 
began under International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank structural adjustment pro­
grammes (SAPs) in the 1980s. The liberalization policies pursued include reducing the role 
of the State in agricultural markets, for instance by cutting its support to the farm sector, and 
reducing barriers to international trade in agricultural products. 
Its advocates claim  that  liberalization will bring  the greatest eff iciency and  therefore  the 
greatest  welfare  gains  to  rural  sectors,  making  us  all  better  off.  Liberalization  has  indeed 
resulted  in  huge  growth  in  agricultural  production  accompanied  by  huge  increases  in  the 
volume  of  products  traded.  Large  farmers  can  survive  without  State  support. And  whilst 
agribusiness thrives, liberalization has driven many small-scale farmers out of business. 
Indeed,  agricultural  imports  can  complement  local  production,  increase  dietary  choices 
and provide an alternate source of nutrition. Exporting local produce can also offer new mar­
kets and opportunities for employment and income. But not everyone benef its from the op­
portunities  of  increased  trade  –  in  many  cases  the  livelihoods  of  small-scale  farmers  and 
agricultural  labourers  have  worsened.  The  reality  is  that  simply  expanding  or  liberalizing 
trade does not automatically translate into poverty reduction, for a number of reasons. 

• First, most food is produced for local consumption, and only a small proportion – about 
10% – is traded internationally. Whilst export markets provide a useful secondary channel 
for  some producers, and a vital primary channel for a few (such as coffee growers); the 
vast majority of small-scale farmers sell their goods to local consumers, which means that 
export markets are limited to a small number of large-scale farmers. 
•	 Second,  there  is no guarantee  that food produced for export  to rich countries will be ac­
cepted. Access to developed country markets for developing country products depends on 
producers being  able  to meet  specif ic  international  standards,  such  as on  food  safety or 
packaging. Many developing countries do not have the capacity or infrastructure to meet 
these standards, which are high and result in limiting developing country exports. 

Box 2: Liberalization: the case of Ghana 

In Ghana, agriculture is an important part of the economy, employing 65% of the active labour 
force. Even before the WTO was created, IMF and World Bank loan programmes required Ghana 
to dismantle subsidies that the State provided to small farmers producing tomatoes, rice and 
poultry. At  the  same  time, Ghana had  to open  its markets  to produce  from abroad. Following 
this, cheap imports of poultry from the U.S. and Europe, tomatoes from the EU, and rice from 
the U.S. and Asia flooded the market. The lack of subsidies reduced local farmers’ competitive­
ness, and consumers chose  the cheaper,  imported products,  to  the detriment of small-scale 
local producers.

Box 3: Liberalization: the case of Zambia 

After  liberalization  of  maize,  the  producer  price  fell  and  the  consumer  price  increased.  The 
consequence was a 20% drop in maize consumption between 1990/1 and 1996/7. The adverse 
human  rights  impacts  of  this  have  been  documented.  For  instance, malnutrition  and  related 
mortality increased. Due to poverty, health indicators decreased and fewer families sent their 
children to school. Girls suffer disproportionately as household labour is perceived of greater 
benefit than education. 

The IMF’s evaluation of the situation, in 1998, was “While in the long term, [liberalization] will 
improve allocative efficiency and thereby income, in the short term, it reduced food consump­
tion.”

•	 Third, liberalization also means opening the domestic market to higher levels of imports. 
This can actually increase food insecurity because imported food can displace local pro­
duction.  Higher  levels  of  imports  are  particularly  damaging  when  developed  countries 
maintain  artif icially  high  levels  of  production  and  then  sell  surpluses  abroad  at  prices 
below their cost of production, a practice known as “dumping.”3 Dumping can be caused 
by direct payments by a State to its exporters (export subsidies); or by transnational com­
modity  traders and processors who use  their market power  to push down  the prices  they 
pay  to  farmers  and  so  increase  their  prof its.  In  2003,  for  instance  U.S.  wheat  was  sold 
abroad  at  an  average price of 28% below what  it  cost  to produce  it  and  cotton was  sold 
abroad at an average price of 47% below what it cost to produce it.4 
• Fourth, few people can benef it from international agricultural trade because a handful of 
companies dominate world markets. In 1986 it was estimated that 85-90% of global agri­
cultural  trade was controlled by  f ive companies.5  Around 75% of global cereals  trade  is 
controlled by two multinational companies – Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland (ADM). 
And whilst approximately 50% of world coffee supply comes from small-scale farmers, 
40% of global coffee trade is controlled by four companies.6 To  intensify matters, many of 
these  companies,  particularly  in  the  U.S.,  are  the  benef iciaries  of  billions  of  dollars  of 
State subsidies, which enable them to maintain and increase their share of world agricul­
tural markets. Transnational commodity  traders and processors, predominantly from de­
veloped  countries,  have  the  means  to  invest  in  the  production,  processing,  transporting 
and trading processes, giving them a massive advantage over small-scale producers. 

The key  to  realizing human  rights and  improving  livelihoods  in  the  rural  sector  is  to de­
velop  policies  from  a  people-centred  perspective  rather  than  a  narrow  economic-centered 
perspective. A human rights framework can help us def ine people-centred policies.

III  The Human Rights Framework 

Human rights are legally binding on all States of the world. Some of these rules are set out in 
countries’ national laws, others are set out in international human rights treaties. All States in 
the world have ratif ied at least one of these treaties, which include the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).7 
Other  recent  international  commitments  aff irming  human  rights  relevant  to  agriculture 
include the Millennium Development Goals in which all States of the world emphasized their 
commitment to combat poverty, hunger and disease.8  In 2004, the 188 members of the Food 
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) adopted Voluntary Guidelines on the Right to Food.9 
Many internationally-recognized rights are affected by agricultural trade policy, including 
the right to life, to food, to health, to work and to be free from discrimination. Human rights 
law requires States to respect, protect and fulf il human rights. In relation to the right to food, 
for  instance,  the  obligation  to  “respect”  means  that  the  State  should  not  take  actions  that 
deprive people of  their existing access  to adequate  food. The obligation  to “protect” means 
that  the  State  should  enforce  appropriate  laws  to  prevent  third  parties,  including  powerful 
people and corporations, from depriving individuals of their access to adequate food. Finally, 
the obligation  to “fulf il” means  that  the State should  identify vulnerable groups and  imple­
ment policies to ensure their access to adequate food by facilitating their ability to feed them­
selves. As a last resort, the Government is also required to provide adequate food to those who 
cannot feed themselves. As the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food has noted, it is 
also  fundamental  that  participation,  accountability  and  access  to  effective  remedies  be  en­
sured at all times and at all levels of the implementation of the right to food.10 

Box 4: International Human Rights Instruments (extracts) 

Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) states that “everyone has the right to a stand­
ard of  living adequate  for  the health and well-being of himself and his  family,  including  food, 
clothing, housing and medical care.” (Article 25) 

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)  guarantees  the  right  to  life  and 
states that “in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence.” (Articles 1 
and 6) 

International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)  guarantees  an  ad­
equate standard of living, housing, work, food and health. (Articles 6, 11 and 12) 

Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) recognizes the right of every child to an adequate 
standard of  living, as well as  the obligation of States  to combat malnutrition.  (Articles 24 and 
27) 

Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) requires countries to 
take  action  to  guarantee  women’s  human  rights,  and  focuses  on  the  particular  problems  of 
rural  women,  including  participation  in  development  planning  and  access  to  adequate  living 
conditions and health care. (Articles 3 and 14)

Planting the Rights Seed 

Some  rights  such  as  the  right  to  life must  be  implemented  immediately. Others,  such  as 
those to food and to health, can be realized progressively. Progressive realization means that 
States must move as expeditiously as possible towards the realization of the rights. To this end 
they must use “the maximum of available resources,” which refers both to the resources avail­
able  within  a  State  and  those  available  from  the  international  community  through  interna­
tional cooperation and assistance.11  States also have international and extraterritorial human 
rights obligations, for instance through ensuring that their own policies do not impact nega­
tively on the enjoyment of human rights in other countries, and through ensuring that activi­
ties  or  decisions  of  an  international  organization  of  which  they  are  a  member  are  human 
rights-consistent. Human  rights standards come with a  range of procedures  for  their  imple­
mentation and people are able  to  turn  to  the courts, or  to  international redress mechanisms, 
when they are not able to enjoy their rights. 
The  human  rights  framework  provides  useful  tools  for  approaching  economic  and  trade 
policy-making.  Human  rights’  emphasis  on  the  needs  of  the  most  vulnerable  members  of 
society, and on prevention of discrimination, provide a people-centred yardstick against which 
proposed policies can be measured. Moreover, human  rights  require  that States, at  the very 
least,  have  a  policy  in  place  towards  the  realization  of  human  rights. This  means  that  any 
proposed policies must be measured against the likelihood of improving the lot of the poorest 
and most  vulnerable.  In  other words,  the  human  rights  framework  provides  support  for  the 
view  that  there must be assessment of  the  likely  impacts of  trade policies, something many 
public-interest and development advocates have been consistently calling for in recent years. 
The international mechanisms for implementation and supervision can be seized by groups, 
States  or  individuals,  and  are  further  tools  for  holding  economic  actors  accountable  when 
domestic processes fail to promote or protect human rights. 

IV  The WTO and Agricultural Trade Liberalization 

The WTO Agreement on Agriculture (AoA), which came into force as part of the WTO Agree­
ment in 1995,12  does not adopt a people-centred approach to agriculture trade policy-making. 
Instead  it has entrenched  liberalized, export-oriented agricultural  trade policies, which ben­
ef it large-scale producers and food traders. The AoA does contain provisions that would al­
low WTO Members to institute a fairer and more people-centred agricultural trading system, 
but these provisions are largely undef ined and underused. 
This backgrounder focuses on the AoA. But the AoA must be looked at in conjunction with 
other factors, such as IMF and World Bank policies, and bilateral and regional  trade agree­
ments that many countries are now engaged in. These are all part and parcel of a broad agenda 
promoting liberalization and forsaking people and their rights. 

1. The Agreement on Agriculture – main obligations 

According  to  the Marrakesh Agreement  establishing  the WTO,  the  institution’s  aims  are  to 
raise living standards, ensure full employment and increase incomes.13  As part of the WTO, 
the AoA  is  meant  to  further  the  WTO’s  aims  by  “establishing  a  fair  and  market-oriented 
agricultural  trading  system.”14  The AoA  is  structured around  three “pillars:” market access, 
domestic support and export subsidies. 

Backgrounder No. 1 

5 

•	 Market Access: The AoA aims to increase international trade of agricultural produce by 
reducing border obstacles  to  trade such as  taxes and duties, commonly known as  tariffs. 
This  pillar  also  requires  countries  to  abolish  restrictions  on  the  quantity  of  agricultural 
goods  entering  their  markets,  known  as  “quantitative  restrictions.”  During  the  negotia­
tions  that  led  to  the AoA, all “non-tariff ” barriers  to  trade, such as health standards and 
packaging requirements, had to be converted into tariffs, a process known as “tariff ication.” 
•	 Domestic Support: The AoA def ines domestic support as all  types of government sup­
port  to  farmers,  ranging  from  subsidies  for  producing  specif ic  products  or  guaranteed 
prices, to agricultural infrastructure and research. Developed countries are the major pro­
viders of domestic support and pay their farmers billions of dollars each year. The stated 
objective of the AoA’s domestic support pillar was to reduce the amount of money going 
into  production  of  farm  goods;  in  other words,  to  reduce  subsidies  that  distort  farmers’ 
decisions about what and how much they will produce. The AoA divides domestic support 
into three categories, set out in three so-called “boxes,” each of which is subject to differ­
ent WTO requirements. 

Amber Box  subsidies  are  considered  to be  the most  trade distorting. Their  amount  is 
measured on the basis of an “Aggregate Measure of Support” (AMS), which attempts 
to calculate all the f inancial factors that influence a farmer to produce a certain prod­
uct. The AoA required industrialized country Members to reduce their amber box sub­
sidies by 21% by 2003, and developing country Members to reduce them by 13.3% by 
2005. 
Blue Box subsidies are allowed, permitting countries to make direct payments to farm­
ers  if  the  payments  are  linked  to  programmes  that  limit  the  amount  of  production. 
These subsidies do not need to be reduced and can be increased. 
Green  Box  subsidies  are  assumed  not  to  affect  production  levels. The  box  includes 
payments  linked  to  environmental  programmes,  pest  and  disease  control,  infrastruc­
ture development and domestic food aid. It also includes direct payments to producers 
if those payments are not linked to current production and prices, known as “decoupled 
payments.” The WTO  does  not  require  reduction  of  green  box  subsidies,  and  allows 
them to be increased. 

•	 Export Subsidies: These are government payments that cover some of the cost of doing 
business  for  f irms  that export produce. The AoA  lists export subsidies  that WTO Mem­
bers have to reduce, and bans the introduction of new subsidies. 

2. The Agreement on Agriculture – people-centred provisions? 

The AoA  contains  provisions  that  could  protect  particular  countries,  or  groups  of  people 
within  countries,  from  the harmful  effects of  liberalization. These  include Non-Trade Con­
cerns, Special and Differential Treatment,  the Special Safeguard  (SSG), and  the Marrakesh 
Decision on Net-Food Importing Developing Countries. Although these are not implemented 
in  a  way  that  ensures  protection  of  livelihoods  and  human  rights,  they  do  offer  openings 
within  the  existing  structure  of  trade  rules  through  which WTO  Members  can  meet  their 
human rights obligations.

Planting the Rights Seed 

•	

In its preamble, the AoA states that it should be implemented with regard for “Non-Trade 
Concerns,” including food security, rural development, rural livelihoods and the need to 
protect  the  environment. However, what non-trade  concerns mean  in practice, how  they 
should be implemented into the AoA or what the human rights dimensions of these could 
be, has not been developed or implemented by WTO Members. 
•	 Special  and  Differential Treatment  (SDT)  is  an  important  feature  of  all WTO  agree­
ments including the AoA. SDT is intended to grant developing countries more flexibility 
in how  they  implement WTO  rules,  in  recognition of  the disadvantages  they  face  in  the 
world trading system. The AoA, for example, exempts developing countries from domes­
tic support reduction commitments for low-income farmers, to encourage rural develop­
ment. At the Fourth WTO Ministerial Conference, in Doha, Qatar in 2001, Members agreed 
that: “SDT for developing countries shall be an integral part of all elements of the negotia­
tions (…) so as to be operationally effective and to enable developing countries to effec­
tively  take  account  of  their  development  needs,  including  food  security  and  rural 
development.”15  However, developed countries consistently  fail  to honour SDT commit­
ments and aggressively f ight to weaken such provisions in WTO agreements. The result­
ing mechanisms are often weak, such as longer implementation periods and lower reduction 
rates on agreed commitments, or useless, such as unlimited spending allowances for coun­
tries that face unsustainable debt levels and chronic budget shortfalls. Moreover, develop­
ing countries that have joined the WTO in recent years have been given only limited access 
to SDT. 
•	 The Special Safeguard (SSG) is a mechanism open to countries that underwent tariff ication 
to  provide  temporary  protection  to  domestic  farmers  when  there  are  sudden  surges  of 
imports or falls in world prices. This could be a vital mechanism to protect local farmers 
because it provides domestic markets with some protection from dumping, even if it does 
not protect from chronic dumping. A major shortcoming of  the SSG  though,  is  that  it  is 
only  available  to  21  developing  countries:  many  developing  countries  did  not  have  as 
many  non-tariff  bar riers  as  developed  countries,  and  therefore  did  not  undergo  the 
tariff ication process. 
•	 Special  attention  to  food  needs  of  least  developed  countries  (LDCs)  and  net  food-
importing  developing  countries  (NFIDCs). The  negotiators  that  crafted  the AoA  ac­
knowledged  that  the  AoA  would  have  negative  impacts  on  LDCs  and  NFIDCs.  They 
therefore  adopted  the  1994  Marrakesh  Decision  on  Measures  Concerning  the  Possible 
Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and Net Food-Importing 
Developing Countries, as part of the WTO Agreement. This Decision provided for com­
pensation for LDCs and NFIDCs should they be negatively affected by higher food prices 
or reduced food aid following  implementation of  the AoA. Many studies concurred  that 
after the AoA was adopted, LDCs and NFIDCs were increasingly forced to buy food on 
commercial  terms,  while  their  incomes  were  declining.16  Nevertheless,  Members  have 
failed to properly implement the Decision.

 How Does the AoA Affect Human Rights? 

From  a  human  rights  perspective  the AoA  has  four  key  failures:  f irst,  its  export-oriented 
approach puts the emphasis on expanding production and exports rather than improving the 
livelihoods of  those  involved  in agricultural production; second,  the AoA  fails  to  tackle  the 
market power of transnational commodity producers and traders; third, the inadequacy of the 
rules legitimizes and institutionalizes dumping; and fourth, the AoA locks developing coun­
tries into an unlevel playing f ield. 

1. 

Promotes exports rather than livelihoods 

The AoA’s  approach  to  agriculture  is  based  on  the  ideology  of  trade  liberalization.  It  en­
trenches the “right to export” rather than human rights. The AoA is designed to open markets 
worldwide and expand trade. This export-oriented approach does not guarantee improvements 
in  people’s  livelihoods.  In  fact,  it  benef its  the  privileged  minority  that  have  access  to  re­
sources, infrastructure, credit and foreign markets. 

2. 

Fails to tackle corporate control 

Trade liberalization has increased the market power of transnational commodity traders and 
processors, while taking power away from the producers. The AoA contributes to the consoli­
dation of  corporate power by  ignoring  the dominant  role  that  a handful of  large  companies 
play at all levels of the food system. 
Companies gain an increased share of the market by consolidating and acquiring produc­
tive resources and by extending their activities beyond simply producing. Cargill, for exam­
ple, runs a huge f inancial services unit, a seed and fertilizer business, is one of the top three 
beef producers in the U.S. and runs a worldwide transportation business. With a business like 
this,  known  as  a  vertically  integrated  business, Cargill  is more  interested  in  high  sales  vol­
umes and in keeping inputs cheap for its more prof itable livestock and grain processing op­
erations. The  market  power  of  companies  such  as  Cargill  leave  producers  as  price-takers, 
forced to accept whatever price Cargill and companies like it are willing to pay. Farmers, the 
weakest  link  in  the chain, are  left accepting prices below  their cost of production year after 
year and cheap produce is dumped on world markets, whilst 
corporate prof its rise. 
This threatens livelihoods of farmers all over the world, 
leaving  them either  impoverished or dependent on  subsi-
dies to earn a living. 
This situation would not raise human rights concerns if 
governments were  able  to  discipline  corporate  behaviour 
and  ensure  that  farmers  who  sell  to  large  companies  are 
able to negotiate a fair price. However, many governments 
are simply unwilling or unable to control the activities of 
companies, and WTO rules do not help them do this. 

Farmers   in   Mex ico   and   the  
Ph i l ipp ines   who   depend   on  
maize  for  their  livelihoods, do 
not compete with U.S. farmers 
but  with  the  companies  that 
export the maize to their coun-
tries.

3.  Allows dumping to continue 

The WTO does have  rules designed  to prevent dumping. The AoA  for  instance  aims  to  ad­
dress dumping by decreasing State subsidies that affect production and prices, but this does 
not  stop  dumping  for  a  number  of  reasons.  On  the  one  hand,  the  complex  box  system  has 
enabled  developed  countries  to  keep  a  large  portion  of  their  State  subsidies.  On  the  other 
hand, the AoA rules do not address the root causes of dumping, namely excess production and 
the market power of corporations. 
In addition, it is complicated and time-consuming for countries to take action against dump­
ing. For  instance, a country must have domestic anti-dumping  laws  in place  in order  to  im­
pose import duties on dumped products, and many developing countries have no such laws, 
and their only recourse is then to turn to the WTO dispute settlement system, which can take 
up to four years to issue a ruling. This is further complicated by the fact that WTO Members 
are still struggling to def ine which payments to farmers should be allowed by WTO rules. 
Dumping  is  a  human  rights  issue  because  farmers  in  developing  countries  are  unable  to 
protect  themselves  against  dumping.  Coupled  with  the  lack  of  social  safety  nets,  this  has 
caused serious human rights concerns since the implementation of the AoA, particularly for 
small-scale farmers who lose their livelihoods due to competition from subsidized, dumped 
imports. 
The human rights framework calls for governments to implement safety nets, and requires 
of States that they implement policies that pay particular attention to the needs of the poor.17 
Whilst there are certainly cases where governments are simply unwilling to implement such 
policies, liberalization commitments made at the WTO (and at the World Bank and the IMF), 
also  prevent  countries  from  being  able  to  design  and  determine  their  own  national  policy 
strategies which might address the problems at the border, for instance through raising tariffs, 
or imposing import quotas to protect against import surges. 

Box 6: Volumes and value of imported products 

A 1999 FAO study of 14 countries showed that all experienced a rise in food imports, and there­
fore  of food  import bills between 1995-98 compared with previous years. The cost of food  im­
ports more than doubled for India and Brazil and increased by 50-100% for Bangladesh, Morocco, 
Pakistan, Peru and Thailand. In India, the volume of vegetable oils imported increased almost 
seven-fold during the 1995-98 period as compared with 1990-94, and palm oil imports increased 
646% from 249 000 to 1 609 000 tonnes. The volume of cereals imported into India increased by 
332%  during  the  same  period.  In  Brazil,  wheat  and  wheat  flour  imports  increased  by  43.3% 
between  1990-94  and  1995-98.  Dairy  product  imports  increased  by  194.6%.  As  a  result,  the 
share of domestic production in the consumption of these products decreased, and dependency 
on imports intensified.

Locks developing countries into an unlevel playing f ield 

Since the 1980s World Bank and IMF structural adjustment programmes have pressured de­
veloping countries to reduce most of their trade barriers. This has created the situation exist­
ing today, which sees many developing countries with low border protection measures, little 
scope for domestic price controls and little possibility to provide subsidies due to their limited 
resources. Conversely, developed countries are not subject to World Bank and IMF liberaliza­
tion requirements to reduce and eliminate trade barriers and they have the f inancial means to 
provide support to their farmers. 
Instead of seeking to redress the imbalance, WTO rules have locked all countries into the 
existing unfair system, which is characterized by many developing countries having few trade 
barriers,  leaving  them  little  space  to  re-introduce  trade  policies  to  support  their  agriculture 
sector. 
From  a human  rights perspective,  this  situation  is problematic,  as  it deprives developing 
countries  of  the  policy  space  they  need  to  implement  policies  to  protect  their  people,  for 
instance to take steps to manage the flow of imports, to prevent dumped products from abroad 
or to maintain domestic price controls. In particular, it can hinder developing countries’ abil­
ity to take steps to respect, protect and fulf il human rights. 
Countries’ obligations to cooperate internationally for the realization of human rights means 
that richer countries have an obligation to ensure that practices within their jurisdiction do not 
prevent other countries from taking the steps necessary to respect, protect and fulf il human 
rights. 
Another dimension of this obligation is that through their membership and influence over 
the policies of organizations such as the IMF and the World Bank, developed countries must 
take steps to ensure that IMF and World Bank policies are not undermining countries’ ability 
to fuf il their duties in the area of human rights. UN human rights treaty supervisory bodies 
have recognized this on several occasions. In 2000, for instance, the Committee on Economic, 
Social  and Cultural  rights  encouraged  “the Government of  Italy,  as  a member of  [the]  IMF 
and  the  World  Bank,  to  do  all  it  can  to  ensure  that  the  policies  and  decisions  of  those 
organizations  are  in  conformity  with  the  obligations  of  States  parties  to  the  Covenant,  in 
particular the obligations […] concerning international assistance and cooperation.”18 

Box  7:  A  UN  human  rights  body’s  view  of  IMF  and  World  Bank  programmes  human  rights

“…some  aspects  of  structural  adjustment  programmes  and  economic  liberalization  policies 
introduced by the Government of Egypt, in concert with international financial institutions, have 
impeded the implementation of the Covenant’s provisions, particularly with regard to the most 
vulnerable groups of Egyptian society.”

Finally, more and more people are arguing that international organizations themselves have 
obligations. Thus, the IMF, the World Bank and the WTO would be considered to bear respon­
sibility for sustaining such an unequal and inequitable pattern of liberalization worldwide. 

VI	 Some Simple Steps Towards Ensuring 
Fair Agricultural Trade Rules 

1.	

Support stronger and simpler rules to prevent and counter dumping 

The WTO  should  improve  and  strengthen  the  def inition  of  dumping  so  that  products  are 
considered dumped when they are sold below their cost of production. In addition, importing 
countries  should  have  the  ability  to  immediately  impose  countervailing  and  anti-dumping 
duties where goods are sold abroad for less than the cost of production. 
Groups working on agricultural policy also advocate the publication of annual full-cost of 
production estimates for OECD countries. They are also calling on governments to develop a 
more thorough and transparent methodology to measure the extent of dumping, and make the 
relevant data publicly available in a timely way. Human rights advocates can support efforts to 
this  end by  recalling governments’ obligations  relating  to  freedom of  information,  and par­
ticipation in policy-making, as well as bringing to bear the human rights arguments that plead 
against dumping itself. 

2.	

Take non-trade concerns into account and use safety nets 

Reflecting and incorporating non-trade concerns into agricultural trade policy can change the 
economic-centered perspective of  the WTO and bring  in  social, environmental and cultural 
concerns. A people-centred approach can help distinguish between non-trade concerns  that 
serve  to  protect  already  powerful  interests  and  those  that  promote  livelihoods  and  human 
rights. 
Some countries have attempted to include non-trade concerns in agriculture negotiations. 
Industrialized countries like Japan, Norway and Switzerland have called for protection of 
th e   dom e s t i c   ag r i cu l tu r e   s e c to r   to   b e   a l lowed,   on   th e   g round s   th a t   ag r i cu l tu r e   i s  
“multifunctional,”  i.e.  plays  a  cultural  and  environmental  role  in  addition  to  serving  food 
protection. 
Developing  countries,  grouped  in  the  “Alliance  for  Special  Products  (SP)  and  a  Special 
Safeguard Mechanism (SSM),” known as the G33, advocate WTO recognition of SPs and the 
SSM. The SSM would allow developing countries to protect their domestic markets against 
volatility and sudden  import surges. They would be exempt  from new  tariff  reduction com­
mitments on SPs. SPs have not yet been def ined but would probably be determined according 
to criteria of food security and rural development needs. Although it is still unclear what the 
SSM and SPs will look like, they could be a welcome mechanism through which to promote 
fairer and more people-centred agriculture rules. 
Gender groups are looking at how gender considerations can be reflected in the def inition 
of SPs and the SSM. This is an approach human rights advocates could usefully learn from 
and support.19

3.  Make Special and Differential Treatment provisions 
more meaningful 

Developing  countries  have  long  insisted  that  existing  SDT  mechanisms  are  insuff icient  to 
address the disadvantages they face. In response, they have tabled 88 proposals at the WTO to 
improve SDT, which are cur rently under review. Human rights advocates could usefully sup­
port these efforts, for instance through contacting their trade ministry or trade negotiators in 
Geneva to ensure that the July 2005 deadline is met. 

4.	 Conduct Impact Assessments 

Article 20 of the AoA calls for the current WTO agriculture negotiations to be informed by a 
review of how the AoA had worked by the end of 2000. Assessment of the effects of the AoA 
subsidy reduction commitments was to be central to the review. The review was also to focus 
on experience with non-trade concerns  including  food security,  rural development and pro­
tection of the environment. Although an “Analysis and Information Exchange” process took 
place at the time in the WTO, its approach was narrow and is generally considered not to have 
fulf illed the Article 20 review requirement. 
Human rights law requires States to monitor the enjoyment of human rights in their country, 
and  to  ensure  that  policies  contribute  towards  the  realization  of  human  rights.  Given  that 
liberalization, as def ined and implemented through the WTO, has caused retrogression from 
the  enjoyment  of  human  rights,  it  is  essential  that  the  human  rights  impacts  of  any  new 
negotiations  be  assessed  before  entering  into  new  commitments. National  governments,  as 
well  as  on  the  WTO,  IMF  and  World  Bank,  should  be  called  upon  to  ensure  that  such 
assessments take place. 
Given  that WTO Agreements,  including  the AoA,  primarily  regulate  relations  between 
States and not within them, a human rights approach to assess agriculture trade liberalization 
would be of particular value, since it would deal with questions of how resources are allocated 
within a country. Human rights can support efforts to ensure that any countries’ trade policy 
commitments do not result in discrimination between groups within the country. 

5.	

Tackle corporate control 

Trade  and  development  organizations  are  calling  for  better  management  of  the  power  of 
transnational corporations (TNCs). Meanwhile, an increasing number of human rights advo­
cates  are  focusing  on  the  human  rights  obligations  of  private  business.  The  human  rights 
framework is indeed a powerful tool for holding private corporate actors accountable for the 
harmful human effects of their activities. 

6.	

Ensure coherence between governments’ economic

and human rights obligations


States’  human  rights  obligations  cannot  be  discarded when  countries  are  negotiating  at  the 
WTO or with the IMF or World Bank. Whilst the WTO is now paying more attention to the 
question of policy coherence, it focuses almost exclusively on coherence between countries’ 
trade, f inance and economic policies. This view of coherence needs to be broadened to ensure 

12 

Planting the Rights Seed 

that  countries  do  not  enter  into  trade  or  f inancial  agreements  that  undermine  their  social 
policies or their ability to meet their human rights obligations. 
Human rights, trade and development advocates could contact their ministries responsible 
for trade, as well as their negotiators in Geneva and call on them to ensure that human rights 
obligations are upheld in any new trade agreements. Human rights advocates could usefully 
increase efforts to share information and coordinate activities with those working to promote 
development  to put pressure on States  to share  information and coordinate activities across 
ministries, in order that trade rules do not forsake people and their rights. 

VII  Conclusion: A Vision for a Global Food System 

The majority of poor people in the world live in rural areas. To promote true development and 
fulf il human rights, States must implement policies that have an explicit focus on the needs 
and capabilities of these people. This does not preclude the expansion of trade, as trade can be 
a valuable tool for development. It does however, require that trade policy be clearly people-
centred. Trade seen as an end in itself will not improve enjoyment of human rights or contrib­
ute to lasting economic or social development. 
As it stands, the WTO Agreement on Agriculture fails to provide an adequate framework 
for agriculture that is consistent with human rights. Instead, its focus on liberalizing the agri­
culture sector worldwide and has led to an agreement that risks displacing poor farmers who 
have  no  other  options,  and  leaving  them  prey  to  the  behaviour  of  commodity  traders  and 
agribusinesses. 
Trade and development NGOs as well as farmers groups have started their quest to develop 
and advance their vision of a fairer global food system, one that promotes human rights and 
guarantees food security, livelihoods and sustainable development. Human rights groups should 
join this process. In the meantime, this Backgrounder offers an initial approach to understanding 
the main problems with the agriculture trade system, and ideas for steps to improving it.
