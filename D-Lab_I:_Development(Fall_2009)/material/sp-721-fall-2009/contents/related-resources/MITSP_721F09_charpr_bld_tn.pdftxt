This	project	is	a	very	low-cost	device	for	forming	charcoal	briquettes.	It	is	composed	of	three	welded	 
metal	parts	and	a	wooden	block.	To	make	it,	you	will	learn	to	use	a	band	saw,	a	sander,	a	drill	press,	 
the	OMAX	water	jet	cutter	and	several	hand	tools.		You	will	also	learn	to	do	some	basic	welding.

1Notes on the charcoal press: 

The	students	in	D-Lab	II	have	all	been	exposed	 
to	the	charcoal	project	as	a	case	study	on	the	 
design	process.	 	The	evolution	of	 the	design	 
is	 an	 interesting	 one,	 and	 eventually	 leads	 
to	 the	 following	 insight:	 “If	 you	want	 to	make	 
something	ten	times	cheaper,	remove	90%	of	 
the	material”.	 	A	 collection	 of	 photographs	 is	 
included	at	the	end	of	this	note. 

The	material	 you	will	 need	 for	 each	 press	 is	 
roughly	as	follows: 

½”	steel	pipe	(~1	foot) 
2”	steel	pipe	(~3	inches) 
1/8”	steel	plate	(~7”	x	3”) 
4”	x	4”	wood	(~6”) 

Don’t	cut	the	pieces	to	length	for	the	students,	 
but	rather	have	 them	cut	pieces	off	of	 longer	 
pieces	 of	 stock—it’s	 important	 that	 they	 get	 
used	 to	 starting	 from	 the	 material	 in	 it’s	 raw	 
form. 

Teaching Notes 
Build-It Background 

	 
The	 Build-It	 modules	 were	 designed	 to	 give	 students	 experience	 
with	a	variety	of	tools	and	manufacturing	techniques	while	at	the	same	time	 
exposing	 them	 to	some	simple,	appropriate	 technologies.	 	These	modules	 
show	 them	 both	 the	 rapid	 prototyping	 equipment	 that	 is	 available	 at	 MIT	 
as	well	as	 techniques	 that	are	used	 in	workshops	 in	 the	developing	world.		 
We	 have	 developed	 four	 modules	 that	 cover	 a	 broad	 range	 of	 tools	 and	 
techniques:

sanding

water	jet	cutting

These	 modules	 were	 designed	  to	 demonstrate	 and	 use	 equipment	 at	 
MIT	 that	we	wanted	our	students	 to	 learn	how	 to	use.	 	They	can	easily	be	 
adapted	 to	 use	 other	 tools	 and	 equipment.	 	 Design	 teams	 in	 D-Lab	 II	 are	 
made	up	of	four	students,	so	each	team	had	one	student	doing	each	of	the	 
different	modules,	 thus	ensuring	 that	 the	 team	had	seen	all	of	 the	different	 
tools	 and	 techniques.	 	 In	 the	 spirit	 of	 sustainability,	 the	 end	 result	 of	 the	 
module	 is	 that	students	produce	a	useful	 item	 that	will	be	disseminated	 to	 
community	partners	in	future	D-Lab	trips	as	they	learn	how	to	use	the	tools	 
and	equipment. 

Each	 of	 these	 projects	 takes	 three	 1.5-hour	 sessions;	 it	 is	 best	 that	 these	 
sessions	 are	 a	 full	 week	 apart,	 to	 give	 the	 students	 time	 to	 finish	 the	 
necessary	 work	 before	 the	 next	 session.	 	 It	 is	 intended	 that	 the	 projects	 
are	 done	 as	 part	 of	 a	 hands-on	 tutorial,	 with	 plenty	 of	 guidance	 from	 the	 
teacher.	 	 Some	 instructions	 are	 given	 in	 the	 text	 of	 the	 exercise,	 but	 it	 is	 
assumed	 that	 the	 teacher	 will	 go	 over	 basic	 safety	 and	 training	 for	 each	 
piece	 of	 equipment	 prior	 to	 the	 students	 using	 it.	 	 If	 the	 students	 do	 not	 
have	a	lot	of	machine	experience,	you	may	want	to	do	the	projects	in	small	 
groups	 (4	 to	8),	so	 that	 the	students	can	be	closely	supervised.	 	 It	 is	often	 
useful	for	the	students	to	work	together	in	pairs	to	help	each	other	through	 
the	 process.	 	This	 document	 includes	 notes	 from	 our	 experiences	 at	MIT,	 
if	 you	 have	 any	 comments	 or	 insights	 to	 share,	 please	 e.mail	 them	 to	me	 
(Amy	Smith).

Cutting the pipe: 
You	will	need	two	pieces	of	½”	pipe,	one	7.5”	long,	one	2.5”	long.		You	can	 
cut	it	using	a	hacksaw	or	a	band	saw.		 

If	 using	 a	 band	 saw	 to	 cut	 the	 pipe,	 be	 very	 careful	 that	 the	 pipe	 is	 firmly	 
gripped—the	saw	teeth	will	catch	on	the	surface	of	the	pipe	it	can	cause	the	 
part	 to	spin	(with	a	surprising	amount	of	 force).	You	can	use	a	vise	 to	hold	 
the	part	so	that	it	won’t	spin.		 

To	cut	steel,	the	band	saw	should	be	set	at	a	cutting	speed	of	about	 
100	ft/sec.		Be	sure	that	the	guard	is	set	to	the	right	height	before	beginning	 
to	cut.		 

Once	the	initial	cut	is	made,	turning	the	pipe	slowly	as	you	cut	into	it	makes	 
a	cleaner,	squarer	cut.		 

If	you	are	using	a	hack	saw	 to	cut	 the	pieces,	be	sure	 that	 the	pipe	 is	held	 
firmly	in	a	vise,	near	the	place	where	you	are	making	the	cut.		 

You	will	also	need	to	cut	a	piece	of	2”	pipe	that	is	2.5”	long	for	the	cup. 

Cutting and drilling the wooden block: 
Cut	a	6”	long	piece	of	4”	x	4”	wood.		You	can	use	either	the	band	saw	or	a	 
hand	saw	to	cut	the	wooden	block.		 

A	coarser	blade	may	be	used	 to	cut	 the	wood,	but	 it	 is	not	necessary.	You	 
can	use	the	belt	sander	to	smooth	and	bevel	the	edges.	 

Mark	the	middle	of	the	block	(you	can	do	this	by	drawing	diagonal	lines	from	 
corner	to	corner,	or	by	measuring.		 

Put	 a	 15/16”	 drill	 bit	 in	 the	 drill	 press	 and	 line	 the	 tip	 up	with	 the	 center	 of	 
the	 block.	 	A	 Forstner	 bit	 is	 a	 good	 option	 for	 this	 application,	 as	 it	 leaves	 
a	clean,	smooth,	flat	bottom	to	the	hole.		If	you	use	a	twist	drill,	you	should	 
step	up	to	the	15/16”	hole,	that	is	start	by	drilling	a	smaller	hole,	then	move	 
up	to	the	larger	bit	size.		 

Drill	 the	hole	at	 least	2.6	 inches	deep,	so	 that	 the	ejector	can	easily	fit	 into	 
the	hole	when	the	briquettes	are	being	formed.

Additional Teaching Notes 

You	 may	 also	 want	 to	 talk	 with	 the	 students	 
about	  pipe	  nomenclature—in	  the	  case	  of	 
steel	 pipe,	 ½”	 refers	 to	 the	 inner	 diameter.		 
You	can	also	explain	 the	difference	between	 
welded	 pipe,	 which	 will	 have	 a	 small	 ridge	 
running	 through	 it	 (which	 can	 be	 a	 problem	 
if	something	needs	to	be	rotated	inside	of	it),	 
and	seamless	pipe.	 	You	can	also	 talk	about	 
the	different	materials	that	pipe	is	made	from	 
and	what	the	merits	are	of	each. 

You	might	want	to	try	to	have	the	students	do	 
some	cuts	with	the	hack	saw	as	well,	so	that	 
they	can	see	that	sometimes	it’s	just	faster	to	 
do	things	by	hand. 

33Session 2 

Cutting the end plates: 
The	end	plates	of	the	two	plungers	must	fit	easily	inside	the	cup.		Measure	 
the	 inner	 diameter	 of	 the	 large	 pipe	 and	 allow	 for	 1/16”	 radial	 clearance.		 
You	will	need	two	of	these	parts.		You	will	also	need	an	endplate	for	the	cup.		 

In	 one	 method,	 the	 end	 plate	 will	 be	 press	 fit	 in	 and	 then	 welded	 along	 
the	 seam,	 as	 shown	 in	 Figure	 2a.	 	 For	 this,	 you	 will	 need	 a	more	 precise	 
measurement	 of	 the	 inner	 diameter:	 allow	 for	 a	 0.002”	 interference	 fit,	 
meaning	 that	 the	 inner	 part	 is	 slightly	 larger	 than	 the	 outer	 part,	 and	 will	 
therefore	stay	in	place	when	forced	into	position.		The	larger	the	interference,	 
the	 tighter	 the	 fit;	 if	 the	 interference	 is	 too	 great,	 then	 the	 parts	will	 not	 be	 
able	to	be	fit	together.		We	will	be	welding	the	two	parts	together,	so	the	fit	 
need	only	hold	the	part	in	place	while	we	are	welding	it,	and	the	interference	 
can	 be	 relatively	 small.	 	Also	 note	 that	more	 compliant	materials,	 such	 as	 
wood	and	plastic,	can	have	larger	interferences. 

The	other	method	for	making	the	cup	is	to	make	a	end	plate	which	is	slightly	 
larger	 than	 the	 pipe,	 and	 then	welded	where	 they	 rest	 together,	 as	 shown	 
in	Figure	2b.		 

For	this,	you	can	have	a	greater	tolerance	on	the	diameter	of	the	end	plate,	 
as	it	merely	needs	to	be	bigger	than	the	pipe,	it	does	not	need	to	fit	precisely	 
inside.		There	should	be	about	1/16”	overhang,	in	order	to	make	the	welding	 
easier.		It	will	be	necessary	to	hold	this	part	in	place	when	welding. 

Think	 about	 the	 pros	 and	 cons	 of	 each	 method	 of	 forming	 the	 cup	 and	 
choose	 one	 of	 these	methods	 and	 determine	 the	 dimensions	 of	 the	 three	 
end	plates.		 

The	end	plate	of	the	cup	will	have	a	0.8”	hole	in	the	center	so	that	the	ejector	 
can	 fit	 through	 it.	 	We	will	 use	 the	water	 jet	 cutter	 to	make	 these	 parts.	 	 If	 
you	are	unfamiliar	with	 the	OMAX	software	and	other	CAD	programs,	you	 
may	want	to	run	through	the	tutorial	before	starting.		Use	the	OMAX	Layout	 
program	 to	 generate	 the	 tool	 path	 for	 the	 three	 end	 plates.	 	 You	 will	 be	 
shown	how	to	use	the	water	jet	cutter	in	class.

Welding the parts: 
Now	 that	 the	pieces	are	cut	 to	size	you	will	put	 them	 together	 to	make	 the	 
final	 parts.	 	 Welding	 is	 the	 process	 of	 joining	 two	 pieces	 by	 melting	 the	 
adjacent	material	and	having	it	re-solidify	to	form	a	joint.		In	some	cases,	a	 
filler	material	is	added.		 

There	 are	 four	 types	 of	 welding	 that	 we	 can	 do	 at	 the	 welding	 shop:	 oxy-
acetylene	welding,	arc-welding,	MIG	welding	and	TIG	welding,	of	which	the	 
first	two	are	most	widely	available	in	the	developing	world. 

Welding	 is	 easiest	 to	 do	 if	 the	 two	 pieces	 are	 of	 a	 similar	 material	 and	 of	 
similar	thickness.		Otherwise,	one	part	may	melt	completely	while	the	other	 
heating	up.		If	one	part	is	bigger	than	the	other,	it	is	necessary	to	adjust	the	 
application	of	heat	so	that	the	two	parts	melt	at	the	same	time. 

When	welding,	 it	 is	 very	 important	 that	 the	 pieces	 are	 held	 together	 firmly	 
before	 you	 start	 welding,	 so	 that	 adjacent	 material	 will	 melt	 together	 and	 
form	a	good	joint	and	so	the	pieces	do	not	move	during	the	welding	process.		 
You	 will	 use	 the	 welding	 fixtures	 in	 the	 shop	 to	 hold	 the	 pieces	 together	 
while	you	weld	them.		 

Be	sure	to	use	protective	clothing	and	goggles,	as	the	radiation	and	extreme	 
light	can	be	dangerous	to	your	skin	and	eyes
