Fuel from the Fields Charcoal


Fuel  from  the  Fields  charcoal  is  an  inexpensive,  clean-burning,  environmentally  friendly 
alternative cooking  fuel  that  is made  from agricultural waste materials and  thus does not 
lead  to  deforestation.  This  instruction  sheet  explains  how  to  make  Fuel  from  the  Fields 
charcoal;  the  process  can  and  should  be  adapted  to  your  local  environment.  We 
encourage  you  to  experiment  and  let  us  know  your  results  (you  can  email  us  at 
charcoal@mit.edu )

Elements for making Charcoal 
 
The main  step  in making  Fuel  from  the  Fields  charcoal  is  carbonization,  which  requires 
three  things: dry organic material  (also  called biomass), heat, and  control of  the amount 
corncobs,  sugarca	   ne  waste  (bagasse),  millet  stalks,  groundnut  shells,  palm  leaves  or 
of oxygen. The biomass may be any of a variety of agricultural waste materials including: 
bamboo.  It must  be  very  dry  in  order  to  burn  properly.  The  heat  is  generated  by  setting 
the  biomass  on  fire,  and  the  oxygen-free  environment  is  created  by  sealing  the  drum 
with sand or soil. The carbonized material is then crushed, mixed with a binder, and then 
made into briquettes.

1. Preparing the Kiln 
A 55 gallon oil drum can be used as a kiln to make charcoal 

Cut a large opening for filling 
the kiln with the material you 
want to carbonize. 

Cut several holes in the 
bottom of the drum. These 
holes allow air to flow 
through the drum while 
burning, which results in a 
hotter fire and produces 
better charcoal. 

A piece of sheet metal is 
needed to cover the top 
hole and prevent oxygen 
from entering the drum, 
allowing the material inside 
to carbonize. 

Burn away oil residue from the drum before making the first batch of charcoal !!!

2. Filling the Drum


Tip the drum on its side, 
and stuff the air vents on 
the bottom with a material 
that ignites easily. 

This will make it easy to 
light the drum from the 
bottom. 

Put a large stick in the 
center of the drum. 

This will create an airway 
shaft to make the fire burn 
better. 

Bagasse
Fill the drum with
bagasse.

Corn Cobs 
Alternate thin (5cm) 
layers of corn husks 
with thicker (25cm) 
layers corn cobs until 
the drum is full.

3. Lighting the Fire


Before starting the burn, place the drum on top 
of three stones, so that air can flow through the 
holes in the bottom. 

Remove the stick in the center for ventilation. 

Light the material at the 
bottom of the barrel. 

The burning material will 
produce a lot of smoke… 

After 5-10 minutes, 
the smoke will be 
hot enough that 
you can ignite it to 
make the fire burn 
more cleanly.

4. Sealing the Drum


After another 5-10 minutes, cover the 
drum with the metal lid. 

Carefully remove the stones from under 
the drum while supporting the drum with 
a stick. 

Seal the bottom edges and the top of the 
drum with sand or dirt to prevent oxygen 
from entering. Wait at least 2 hours 
before opening.

5. Crushing the Charcoal 


There are many ways to crush charcoal. Adding water while crushing helps to prevent 
dust from spreading around. 

You can crush charcoal in a bag with a stick,  or with a mortar and pestle using a 
cover to prevent dust from flaring up, 

or on a tarp using stones. 

A charcoal crushing machine can be 
used for large quantities.

6. Making the Binder 
The  binder  for  making  the  briquettes  can  be  made  from  many  different  materials: 
cassava, aloe, or banana. 

Grate one cassava. 

Mix with boiling water 
until thick and sticky. 

1 Cassava 

1.5 L of boiling water 

1 Drum of crushed 
carbonized material 

8 

Combine charcoal and 
binder mixture. 

7. Making Briquettes


Fill the press with 
charcoal mixture. 

Hit plunger to 	
Push up the 
form the briquette.	 ejector to remove 
the briquette.

8. Drying Briquettes

Let the briquettes dry in the sun for 3 -4 days.
