Fuel from the Fields 
Ch a r co a l 
B a c k g r o u n d 
More than 2 billion people use wood, charcoal, dung or agricultural residues 
as the primary fuel for their cooking and heating needs, leading to significant 
health,  economic  and  environmental  consequences.  Burning  wood  or 
agricultural  residues  produces  smoke  with  a  variety  of  irritant  pollutants, 
some  of  which  are  known  carcinogens.  More  than  1.5  million  deaths  a 
year are caused by acute respiratory infections from breathing smoke from 
indoor  cooking  fires.  Women  and  children  are  generally  exposed  to  the 
greatest levels of pollutants and it is children who suffer the greatest health 
risk – respiratory infections are the leading cause of death of young children 
worldwide. 

Small-scale  subsistence  farmers  who  make  less  than  US$2  per  day  may 
use  wood  charcoal  for  cooking  fuel.  In  areas  where  wood  is  scarce  and 
farmers  are  not  able  to  collect  it  themselves,  the  cost  of  cooking  fuel  is  a 
significant  drain  on  their  limited  resources.  An  estimated  50  billion  hours 
are  spent  collecting  firewood  each  year  and  families  can  spend  over  25% 
of their  income on fuel,  leaving them with  less  income to cover other basic 
needs  such as medicine,  food and  clean water. For  comparison, even  the 
poorest  20%  of  the  U.S.  population  spends  only  1%  of  their  income  on 
energy for their household.

Furthermore,  many  areas  of 
environmental  problems  due  to  deforestation  as  almost  half  the  world’s 
timber harvest  is burned  for  fuel. For example, Haiti  is 98% deforested as 
a  result  of  demand  for  fuel.  Due  to  necessity  driven  by  severe  economic 
and  political  instability,  the  remaining  trees  continue  to  be  cut  down. 
Deforestation  results  in  devastating  soil  erosion  –  a  major  contributor  to 
the hundreds of  lives  lost every  year due  to mudslides and  flooding – and 
can also lead to longer term detrimental effects such as the degradation of 
aquatic life along the coasts of Haiti. 

In the year 2000, indoor air pollution from solid fuel use was responsible for more than 1.6 million annual deaths and 2.7% of the global burden of disease.            -World Health OrganizationYouTube video of a charcoal burn and press demonstration with Amy Smith.1Several  attempts  have  been  made  to  introduce  environmentally-friendly, 
cleaner  cooking  alternatives  such  as  solar  cookers,  fuel-efficient  stoves 
and  charcoal  briquettes  made  from  paper.  Solar  cookers  can  be  slower 
than  traditional stoves, may work only during  limited hours on sunny days, 
and  are  often  unable  to  fry  foods,  which  precludes  them  from  being  used 
to  cook  many  traditional  dishes.  Fuel-efficient  stoves  have  started  to  be 
disseminated in regions ranging from India to Sudan, but while they reduce 
the  consumption  of  wood-based  or  fossil  fuels,  they  may  not  necessarily 
eliminate it. An effort to produce briquettes from waste paper was introduced 
to reduce wood use, but initially these briquettes can be difficult to use and 
they still produce a significant amount of smoke.  Furthermore, waste paper 
is  not  readily  available  in many  rural  areas.  For  alternatives  to  traditional 
cooking  to  be  met  with  better  success,  they  must  prove  to  be  affordable, 
effective and culturally acceptable. 

In  2002,  D-lab  at MIT  developed  a  radically  different  solution  called  “Fuel 
from the Fields” that addresses the problem of fuel scarcity with the economic 
needs  of  small-scale  farmers  in mind. The  project  offers  farmers  a way  to 
turn  their  agricultural  waste  into  charcoal,  a  cooking  fuel  alternative  that 
is  more  affordable  and  healthier  than  wood-based  fuels.  While  charcoal-
making  technologies  have  been  around  for  thousands  of  years  and  other 
charcoal  initiatives exist,  they are often based on a  centralized production 
and  distribution  model  that  can  require  a  capital  investment  of  tens  of 
thousands of dollars. This charcoal can be made locally and inexpensively 
and  has  positive  health,  environmental  and  economic  benefits:  it  burns 
cleanly, reducing exposure to the smoke that causes respiratory infections; 
it  uses  agricultural  waste  materials,  and  therefore  does  not  contribute  to 
deforestation; and  it  transforms a waste stream  into a high-value,  income-
generating product –  in Haiti, a bag of  charcoal  sells  for US$10. Charcoal 
from agricultural waste can also be paired with complementary technologies 
like  fuel-efficient  stoves  to  further  reduce  fuel  consumption.  By  producing 
their own charcoal, farmers can not only save money that would have been 
spent  on  cooking  fuel,  but  can  sell  excess  charcoal  in  the  market  for  an 
additional revenue stream. 

To  make  the  charcoal,  agricultural  waste  materials  appropriate  to  the 
season  and  the  region  are  carbonized  in  a  kiln made  from  a  55-gallon  oil 
drum.  The carbonized material is then crushed and formed into briquettes 
using  a  small  press  and  a  binder  made  from  a  source  of  starch  such  as 
cassava, a common root vegetable also known as yucca and manioc. The 
process  takes a  few hours and  requires only simple devices which can be 
made  from  local  materials  and  production  methods  for  less  than  US$25. 
A  farmer  can  produce  enough  charcoal  to  pay  for  the  equipment  and 
start making a profit  in  less  than a month. Microcredit  institutions can also 
provide loans to help entrepreneurs that cannot afford the initial investment, 
or farmers can form charcoal-making cooperatives with a group ownership 
model. The decentralized approach of Fuel from the Fields helps minimize 
transportation costs and ensure that the producers – small farmers – retain 
the profits of their labor. 

The Charcoal 
Briquetting Process 

Charcoal Drum ($15) – converts agricultural 
waste into carbonized material for charcoal 
in a couple hours 

Charcoal Press ($2) – presses carbonized 
material into charcoal briquettes at speeds 
of up to 10-15 briquettes per minute. 
Briquettes pressed by hands crumble. 

2D-Lab is collaborating with community partners in many countries to ensure 
the  product  and  process  are  affordable  and  meet  the  needs  of  the  local 
population who will make and use  the charcoal. The  technology would not 
be where it is today without the community partners, who have contributed 
a number of innovations from the field, such as an easier method of lighting 
the  drum  using  holes  from  below,  a  method  of  dousing  the  carbonized 
material  with  water  to  help  settle  the  dust,  and  several  versions  of  the 
charcoal press, including a charcoal press table that allows multiple people 
to  make  briquettes  simultaneously.  The  evolution  of  the  charcoal-making 
press has also been turned  into a case study, showing how feedback from 
local  users  helped  transform  the  device  into  a  simple  form  that  uses  90% 
less material, operates faster and cost 10 times less. 

The  Fuel  from  the  Fields  charcoal  project  was  one  of  22  winners  (out  of 
more than 2,000 entries) in the 2007 World Bank Development Marketplace 
Competition. As a result, more than 1000 local producers have been trained 
in  the  charcoal-making  technique  and  61  ateliers  (or  local  workshops)  for 
producing  charcoal  have  been  established  in  Haiti.  The  project  has  also 
been displayed at the Smithsonian Design for the Other 90% exhibit in 2007 
and  featured  in  numerous  websites,  radio  programs,  newspaper  articles, 
magazines and books. D-Lab has also demonstrated  the charcoal-making 
process in over 20 countries and developed materials to show people how to 
build each of the 3 pieces of charcoal-making equipment, teaching important 
skills  for  developing  appropriate  technologies  in  the  process. Hundreds  of 
students have participated in hands-on activities with charcoal, where they 
have  an  opportunity  to  learn  how  to  use  shop  tools  and  equipment  while 
producing  useful  charcoal-making  devices  that  can  be  disseminated  to 
community partners during field work trips.

3First Prototype 
$30 
4-5 Briquettes a Minute 

This one often got clogged up with material, 
and had to be cleaned out every three or 
four briquettes.  So we redesigned it with a 
self-cleaning ejection mechanism.  We also 
did a time-study in which we video taped 
several users and figured out how much time 
was spent on each aspect of the process.  A 
lot of time was wasted picking up and putting 
down the hammer, so we redesigned it to 
optimize the tasks of each hand. 

Second Prototype 
$20 
6-8 Briquettes a Minute 

This prototype worked slightly faster, but still 
had some issues. The door was sometimes 
difficult to close, and the ram rod got stuck 
sometimes during use. 

Third Prototype 
$2 
10-12 Briquettes a Minute 

The third iteration drastically reduced the 
amount of material, was easier to construct, 
and sped up the process of producing char-
coal.
