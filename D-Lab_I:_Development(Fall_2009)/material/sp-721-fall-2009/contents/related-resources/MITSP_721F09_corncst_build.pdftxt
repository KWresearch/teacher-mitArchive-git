Cast Corn Sheller

This project is a low-cost device for removing corn kernels from the cob. It is cast in aluminum using a 
casting pattern made on  the 3-D printer.  This project  is  inspired by a plastic corn sheller  from Malawi 
and a cast aluminum sheller  from Ghana.    In order  to make  it you will need  to make a solid model of 
the part and print it on the 3-D printer.  You will use this as a casting pattern to make a cast aluminum 
sheller. To make it, you will learn to use the 3-D printer, sand blaster and various hand tools.

Session 1 
Edgerton Student Shop 
& MechE Cluster
3-D printers make three-dimensional parts by depositing material one layer 
at a time. Since each layer is put down independently of previous layers, it 
allows you to make very complicated parts with great ease.

Different  types of 3-D printers use different materials  for making  the parts.  
The  3-D  printer  at  the  Edgerton  Shop  uses  ABS  (acrylonitrile  butadiene 
styrene)  which  is  a  tough  plastic  and  therefore  the  parts  it  produces  can 
actually be  functional.   However  there are  some  limitations on  the  level of 
detail  that  you  can  produce,  furthermore  the  parts  are  not  as  strong  as  if 
they  were  printed  from  solid ABS.    Other  3-D  printers  print  starch,  which 
produces  parts  that  are  more  fragile,  but  have  greater  detail.  We  will  be 
making a 3-D printed version of the corn sheller to use it as a casting pattern 
for an aluminum corn sheller.  

Printing the sheller
A tutorial for making the SolidWorks model of the sheller can be found at the 
end of this handout.  The tutorial instructs you in making a basic sheller you 
may also add ridges or other  features  to  the outside surface of  the sheller.  
The model should be completed before class so that it can be printed during 
class. You will need to sand the surface of the part to make it smooth so that 
the sand won’t stick to it while making the mold for the casting.  Sand paper 
is available in D-Lab.

Session 2
Foundry

Sand  cast  parts  are  made  by  packing  sand  around  a  pattern,  removing 
the pattern to form a cavity in the sand and then pouring molten metal  into 
the cavity.  The sand has been mixed with additives such as clay so that  it 
retains  the  shape  of  the  pattern.   After  the metal  has  cooled,  the  part  can 
be removed. 

Forming the cavity and pouring the metal
We will  form  the  cavity  in  two  parts,  pressing  the  outside  surface  into  one 
box of sand, and build up the inside surface on the other.  Then we will join 
the two halves together. The molten metal can then be poured into the mold.

Session 3
Finishing the sheller
The excess metal  from where  the metal was poured  in  (the  sprue)  should 
be cut off, as should any metal  that  leaked out  from  the pattern cavity (the 
flash).  In addition, the part can be sand blasted to give it a nice finish.

Solidworks Tutorial
by Jessica Leon, updated by Mike Kozlowski, February 2010

SolidWorks  is  installed  on MechE  computer  clusters  in  the  following  labs: 
Ralph Cross Lab, der Torossian Lab, Ralph Cross Lounge, Papallardo Lab, 
Mechatronics  Lab,  AMP  Lab. 

MIT computer cluster.

Starting Solidworks
Open Solidworks 2007 SP5.0 by going to: 
      Start > All Documents > Solidworks 2007 SP5.0 > Solidworks 2007

Start  a  new  document  by  clicking  on  the  new  document  button  or  File  > 
New Document. In the menu click on New Part – a 3D representation of 
a single design component.  Run through the Solidworks Tutorial lessons 
1 and 2 to practice making simple objects and assemblies.

Making the Solid Model of the Sheller

Chose a plane to draw your object on
- Click on Front Plane in the left side tool bar, then Sketch in the toolbar. 

- It helps if you draw while Normal To the plane

Draw the cross section of the cone 
- Draw a Horizontal Centerline through the origin of the plane and another 
one 2  inches above  it  for drawing  reference. This  represents  the height of 
the sheller. 

Draw the base lines 
One  on  the  bottom  centerline  and  one  on  the  top  centerline.  Smart 
Dimension the length of one line to be 0.25”.  Add a Relation to the lines to 
make  them equal. Smart Dimension  the distance between  the origin and 
the inside edge to be 1 inch.

555

Connect  the  lines on each  side and Smart Dimension one by  clicking on 
the angled line and then the centerline to make the angle 85 degrees.

Your cross section is now done.

Revolve your piece
- Draw  the  line  that will  be  the  axis  of  rotation  going  from  the  origin  to  the 
top centerline.
- Go to the toolbar and click on Features.  A new toolbar will appear. Click 
on Revolved Boss/Base.
- Choose the axis you  just drew to be the center of rotation and rotate 360 
degrees

Draw the cross section of the fin
In  a  new  Sketch  on  the  Front  Plane,  make  the  cross  section  of  the  fin. 
Trace the profile of the sheller body with lines. Add a Relation to make the 
lines parallel slanting.  Smart Dimension the inside edge to be 5/8” (0.63”) 
from the origin.

 

666

Rotate the fin
- Click Revolved Boss/Base and choose the angled line nearest to the 
origin as the center of rotation. 
- Choose Two Direction, and set the rotation to 45 degrees for each

Add multiple fins
- Insert an Axis of rotation in the Reference Geometry window.

- Click on the Cylindrical/Conical Face option and choosing the inside 
face of the body of the sheller.

- Click on Revolve 2 in the left-hand side bar to select the fin you just drew 
then select Circular Pattern in the top tool bar. Revolve around the Axis 
you added. Choose 5 fins with Equal Spacing.

777

Clean up the top surface
- Create a Reference Geometry Plane 2 inches from the top plane. 

- Make a drawing on this plane of a circle the diameter of the sheller ’s 
outer edge. 

- Extrude cut upwards through all.

You’re Done!
Save the file as a Solidworks Part (.sldprt) and then Save As an STL (.stl) 
file since this is the format processed by the 3D printer.
