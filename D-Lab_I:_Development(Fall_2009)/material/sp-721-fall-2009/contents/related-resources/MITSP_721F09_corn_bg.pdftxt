Maize (corn) is one of the most important staple crops in the world. In Kenya, 
for example, 45% of the population considers Ugali (maize meal) to be their 
survival food, making it the most consumed food of the country. Maize also 
accounts  for  43%  of  the  Latin American  diet.  In Asia, maize  production  is 
over  200  billion  kilograms  a  year  and  it  is  expected  that  the  total  maize 
production  in  developing  countries  will  eventually  overtake  production  in 
industrialized countries.

In many rural areas of developing countries, the maize kernels are removed 
from  the  cob  by  hand  in  a  process  called  shelling.  Shelling  the  annual 
maize  harvest  by  hand  typically  takes weeks  and may  pull  children  out  of 
school,  since  processing  food  for  survival  takes  priority  over  education  in 
subsistence  farming  households.  The  hardened,  dry  maize  can  also  be 
painful to shell and lead to hand injuries.

Existing  alternatives  to  shelling  maize  by  hand  are  often  unaffordable  or 
difficult  to  obtain  for  subsistence  farmers. An  estimated  550 million  small-
holder farmers in the world lack access to mechanized agricultural technology. 
Industrial  maize  shellers  are  prohibitively  expensive,  with  a  cost  range 
of  US$1,200-1,800;  small-scale  hand-cranked  or  pedal-powered  maize 
shellers  cost US$20-50, which  is  still more  than many  families  can  afford. 
While  industrial  shellers  are  highly  productive,  their  energy  infrastructure 
requirements  can  render  them  unusable  in  rural  villages.  Furthermore, 
mechanized  equipment  and  stationary  pedal-powered  devices  are  difficult 
to  transport  to  the  users. As  a  consequence,  farmers  may  be  required  to 
travel  long  distances  to  process  their  crops  or  the  technology may  not  be 
able to reach the communities who need it most.

times  faster  than  by  hand.  The  device  has  the  additional  advantages  of 
being  robust, portable,  transparent  to users and only a  fraction of  the cost 
of other alternatives commonly on the market. The maize sheller is currently 
mass-produced using injection-molded plastic or cast aluminum. In regions 
where the device is not currently being manufactured or distributed, the tool 
cannot  be  locally  made  using  these  infrastructure-intensive  processes.  In 
response, the D-Lab program at MIT,  in collaboration with their community 
partners, has developed  several  versions of  the maize  sheller  that  can be 
made using locally available materials and methods.

One  such  device  is  a  sheet  metal  sheller,  that  has  been  developed  by  a 
number of D-Lab staff members and community partners. Marco Villagarcia, 
an engineer from Cusco, Peru, made the initial sheller by forming ridges on 
a  curved  piece  of  sheet  metal  to  replicate  the  inner  surface  of  the  mass-
produced  plastic  shellers  from  Malawi.  The  design  was  simplified  by  Ralf 
Hotchkiss of Whirlwind Wheelchari International and Dennis Nagle of D-Lab 
who used a straight piece of sheet metal with  tapered  ridges  to produce a 
similar surface. A simple  jig was developed by D-Lab  instructor Amy Smith 
and graduate student Kofi Taha for making these shellers quickly and easily. 
The  process  requires  only  a  hammer,  pliers  and  a  tool  to  cut  the  sheet 
metal into the appropriate size to accommodate the local varieties of maize. 
This  method  has  been  used  in  many  countries,  both  to  produce  maize 
shellers and as part of creative capacity building workshops. During  these 
workshops,  participants  not  only  learn  to  make  a  useful  device,  but  also 
learn that they can be creators of technologies and feel empowered to adapt 
the device  to  their own needs.  In some communities, small manufacturing 
cooperatives have been formed to produce shellers and generate additional 
income.  Other communities may not have abundant sheet metal for making 
maize  shellers,  so D-Lab  and  its  partners  have  developed  versions  of  the 
sheller  made  of  different  materials  based  on  what  is  available  in  each 
region,  including  a  re-bar  sheller,  a  sand-cast  aluminum  sheller  and  a  tin 
can sheller, all of which have the potential to save a family literally hundreds 
of hours of manual labor each year.
