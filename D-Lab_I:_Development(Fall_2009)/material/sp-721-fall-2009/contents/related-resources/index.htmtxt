***** D-Lab Technology Resources *****
[Please note: this content was obtained from theD-Lab_Resourcespage on December
12, 2011. Users are encouraged to check that page for later updates.]
Learn how to build and use D-Lab technologies! Whether you are working with a
community that will greatly benefit from adopting these technologies, or you
want to learn new building skills, or you want to set up a workshop to
disseminate these innovations, here you will find all the materials that you
will need:
    * Background Notes: Contextual information about the challenges being
      addressed, history of technology development, and project deployment
      status.
    * Build-It Modules: For students to learn basic shop skills while building
      a practical technology that can be disseminated in the field. Also comes
      in a version with teaching notes to provide more insight into the
      technology and guide the teacher/facilitator.
    * Do-It Modules: For making and disseminating D-Lab innovations. Uses
      minimal text and simple black &amp; white drawings to facilitate
      translation, printing, distribution and implementation in the field. To
      help the documents last longer, we recommend laminating them or using
      sheet protectors.
