***** Course Description *****
This introductory survey course is intended to develop an understanding of key
issues and dilemmas of planning in non-Western countries. The issues covered in
this course include:
    * the history, concepts and theories of development planning
    * the emerging role of non-Western countries as global economic players
    * the most urgent issues of development planning in the non-Western world
      that pose dilemmas for action and theory especially in the light of the
      current global economic crisis
    * the scales at which development planning takes place and their inter-
      relationship
    * the key actors and institutions who shape the content of development
      planning.
The issues covered by the course include state intervention, governance, law
and institutions in development, privatization, participatory planning,
decentralization, poverty, urban-rural linkages, corruption and civil service
reform, trade and outsourcing and labor standards, post-conflict development
and the role of aid in development.
Several themes run through the course. One such theme is the intimate link
between planning, power and legitimacy, chiefly embodied in the state. Planning
involves many actors, but always some governing authority with legitimacy. The
approach to planning in this course involves the state as a governing
authority, with the legitimate power to make changes that affect many other
actors, in its unique role as the 'rule-maker' that determines the
institutional framework for the operation of all other actors, while
recognizing the growth of other governing actors at the local and global
levels. Power also determines whether countries are able to plan, and if so,
the kind of planning that they are able to do in a contested global arena. The
language of legitimacy shapes how and by whom and in what form power can be
exercised.
Another major theme of the course is that planning in developing countries is
much more impacted by the ideas and actions of external actors, compared to
planning in rich industrialized countries. This in turn makes the process of
planning â the actors and institutional processes as well political
sustainability â much more complex and unpredictable. The course also focuses
on the history of planning and development in non-Western countries in order to
better appreciate the achievements and limitations of planning efforts in the
past. The impact of colonialism and imperialism on the political culture,
institutional legacies, and economic prospects of developing countries needs to
be understood. In focusing on this issue, the course would like to call
attention to the importance of historical analysis in planning in developing
countries.
***** Prerequisites *****
There are no prerequisites for this course.
***** Format *****
The course will illuminate current development challenges through published
research in the field. The literature is rich, and across many disciplines in
the social sciences. Case studies and real world examples, through interaction
with planning practitioners, are drawn from around the world. The readings
marked 'required' must be read carefully prior to class. Students are
encouraged to prepare short outlines based on reading notes before coming to
class. The readings marked 'recommended' are suggested to supplement, deepen
and expand the issues raised by the required readings. While students don't
have to read them all before class, they are strongly encouraged to read what
they can in order to fully realize the potential of this course.
