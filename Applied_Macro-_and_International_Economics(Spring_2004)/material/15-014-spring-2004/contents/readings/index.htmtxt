Most of the material in this course is based on cases. For some classes,
however, we will rely on readings from two excellent books:
    * [K] = [Amazon_logo] King, Philip G. International Economics and
      International Economic Policy: A Reader. 3rd ed. McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 1999.
      ISBN: 0-07-236069-0.
    * [E] = [Amazon_logo] Eichengreen, Barry. Toward a New International
      Financial Architecture: A Practical Post-Asia Agenda. Institute for
      International Economics, 1999. ISBN: 0-88132-270-9.
Moreover,Â the professor hasÂ also prepared a list of optional / additional
readings: These focus on the analytical material and often go beyond what we
will cover in class. They are based on:
    * [B] = [Amazon_logo] Blanchard, Olivier. Macroeconomics. 3rd ed. Prentice
      Hall, 2002. ISBN: 0-13-067100-2.
    * [DFS] = [Amazon_logo] Dornbusch, Rudiger, Stanley Fisher, and Richard
      Startz. Macroeconomics. 7th ed. McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 1997. ISBN: 0-07-
      017985-9.
    * [KO] = [Amazon_logo] Krugman, Paul R., and Maurice Obstfeld.
      International Economics: Theory and Policy. 6th ed. Addison-Wesley
      Longman, 2002. ISBN: 0-201-77037-7.
    * [M] = [Amazon_logo] Mankiw, N. Gregory. Macroeconomics. 4th ed. Worth
      Publishers, 1999. ISBN: 1-57259-644-9.
In the table below, letters are followed by chapter numbers. For the lecture
topics, "HBS" stands for the Harvard Business School case studies that were
discussed in class.
