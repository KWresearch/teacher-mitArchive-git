Exchange Rate Determination 

1.-

Introduction 

This note discusses (briefly) the theories behind the determinat ion of the exchange rate. By no 

means this is supposed to be a treaty in the subject. I will leave  important contribut ions aside. 

Thus, here I mostly analyze what in my opinion are the most important ones. 

2.- Theories 

PPP 

The purchasing power parity approach to the exchange rate was, and continues to be, a very 

influential way of thinking about the exchange rate. The PPP derives from the assumption that in 

the world there exists the "law of one price". This law states that ident ical goods should be so ld 

at identical prices. This  is  far from a  law (by the way),  it  is mainly an assumption. 

For the purpose of the  init ial discussion let's believe  it. The law of one price implies that 

exchange rates should adjust to compensate for price different ials across countries. In other 

words, if we are in a banana-world (only bananas exists), and a banana  is so ld  in US at 1 Dollar, 

and the same banana is so ld  in Spain at 133 Pesetas, then the exchange rate has to be 133 Pesetas 

per Dollar.

This is the abso lute PPP approach. Where p represent domest ic prices, p* are foreign 
prices and e is the exchange rate. 

There is also the relat ive PPP approach. It is the same model but applied to differences: 

the change in the exchange rate will compensate inflat ion different ials.

et 

respectively. In other words, a 3 percent inflat ion rate in US and a 1 percent inflat ion rate in 

Japan should  imply a depreciat ion of the Dollar versus the Yen by 2 percent. 

The theory behind PPP  is very appealing. However, when taken to the data, usually we 

do not find PPP to hold in the short, nor medium, run and when we are lucky (truly lucky) we 

find that it ho lds  in the  long run. 

There are several important reasons for PPP not to hold  in the  long run: 

1.	 The  law o f one price might not hold  in the short run: The  law of one price requires a 

perfect arbitrage in goods. This means that individuals should be able to import and 

export any product that are ident ical and have different prices across countries. 

This is hardly a good assumption in the short run. And the fact that domest ic markets 

are relat ively o ligopolist ic  in the short run implies that indeed prices will differ. 

The real world  is closer to one in which good segmentation  is relevant, both in the 

decision of production and pricing. 

2.	 PPP assumes that there is no government intervention: Tariffs, Quotas, VER's, taxes, 

etc. 

3.	 PPP might not even ho ld in the long run: 
•	 There  is an important component of non-tradable goods, and productivity 
different ials in those sectors might be different across countries. This implies that 

there is a permanent change  in the price  level across countries that should not be 

compensated by the exchange rate. 
•	 Taste might change, and thus the real exchange rate. 

•	 Market structures might change, and thus the equilibrium exchange rate. 

Indeed, there are few cases in which PPP holds in the short run. And when it ho lds,  it 

usually economies with very high  inflat ion rates (mostly hyperinflation) where domest ic 

currency has no meaning  in the determinat ion of prices, and the agents tend to dollarize their 

economies. 

Balance of Payments Approach 

This approach is mainly the BB-NN (or dependant economy). The  idea  is that there exists an 

exchange rate at which there exists internal and external equilibrium. 

The  internal equilibrium assumes that  there is full employment: unemployment  is  in the 

natural rate of unemployment. Or in other words, the unemployment  is such that there are no 

pressures to change real wages. 

The external equilibrium refers to equilibrium in the balance o f payments. Sometimes, 

people  look at the current account instead of the balance of payments. 

This is indeed a wonderful theory. It can explain permanent deviations of PPP, but also 

explain PPP if so is required. 

The main problem with this approach  is that in general  it  is extremely difficult to 

determine what is the exact natural rate of unemployment, nor the exchange rate consistent with 

an equilibrium in the external accounts. We tend to think, again, that this is a good guess of the 

long run exchange rate. This model will determine where the exchange rate has to converge to, 

however, it provides very litt le guidance to the short term fluctuations. 

Monetary and Portfolio Approaches 

This is an asset pricing view of the exchange rate. The idea  is that agents have a portfolio cho ice 

decision between domestic and  foreign assets. Those instruments (either money or bonds) have 

an expected return that could be arbitraged. This arbitrage opportunity is what determines the 

process of the exchange rate. 

In its simplest form, this approach implies the uncovered interest rate parity. 
= (1 + i  )(1 +  e E ˆ  )

1 + it 

where the  idea  is that if the expected depreciat ion does not compensates the interest rate 

different ials, agents would have arbitrage opportunit ies. 

This is an amazingly attractive theory. Unfortunately, works extremely bad. This is an 

area of research where st ill today in economics, we have very litt le explanat ions  for its failure. 

3.- How they do in the data? 

I have already hinted  in the previous section that all these theories perform quite badly in the 

short run. Well, this  is not strong enough. The performance  is horrible! Moreover, in a  lot of the 

empirical exercises, not even the signs are correct. 

4.- Government intervention 

Governments  intervene  in foreign markets frequent ly. The  form of this  intervent ion goes from 

selling small amounts of foreign currency, domest ic  instruments, to sterilizat ion and even buying 

stocks in their own stock markets. 

Obviously there are  less intervent ionist central banks (such as the FED) to banks that 

think the exchange rate is just a three dimensional Nintendo. 

The most common form of intervent ion  is called sterilizat ion. The general idea  is the 

fo llowing: assume  foreigners decide to invest at home and start buying home government bonds. 

The price of the bonds goes up, due to the  increase  in demand, which implies a fall in the  interest 

rate. In the end, the reduction in the cost of capital increases aggregate demand pushing prices 

up. A Central Bank who  is concerned with inflat ion responds to the capital inflow with a tight 

monetary policy. This tightening  is what is called sterilizat ion. 

What occurs in the central bank  is that there is an increase  in reserves and a drop in 

domestic credit. Thus, sterilizat ion  is  just a portfo lio re-composit ion of the Central Bank's assets.
