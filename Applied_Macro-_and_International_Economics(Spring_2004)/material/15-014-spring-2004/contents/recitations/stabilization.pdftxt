Inflation, stabilization, and currency boards


In order to understand the benefits of currency boards, first we have to have a closer  look to  the 

process of how inflat ion is produced. This is a topic that has been studied  in our profession 

thousand of times, this short note is just an introduction to the main issues. 

1.- Causes of inflation 

There are several channels that can produce inflat ion. One, that is consistent with the BB-NN,  is 

the overheat ing  in the  labor market. The second one is obviously the price of imports, in 

particular commodit ies. The third one  is the  increase  in the prices of utilit ies. And finally, and 

probably the most devastating one, the one due to the financing of the public deficit. 

When the economy is overheated, by definit ion, there is pressure for the real wages to 

increase. In other words, we should expect a real exchange rate appreciat ion and wage  increases. 

Increases  in the commodity prices or utility prices will push up the cost faced by the 

firms, thus forcing a consumer price  increase. 

These two channels are very important, specially in developed economies, but to be 

honest, they produce small levels of inflat ion. 

In order to get real numbers, we have to have an  important expansion of the money 

aggregates that will erode, in the end, the value of the domestic currency. This happens when we 

finance a fiscal deficit by print ing money. 

The first question that I could think of,  is what causes more  inflat ion, a fiscal defic it of 3 

percent, or a fiscal deficit o f 0.1 percent? Well, the answer  is it depends. It depends on how these 

deficits are financed, and more  importantly, on the domest ic demand. Let me do a series o f 

examples to clarify this statement. 

Money Demand 

Assume that country A has a 3 percent fiscal deficit (3 percent of GDP). Also assume that 

the domest ic currency as a proportion of total GDP  is 12 percent. In other words, in this country 

all liquid assets (currency, checking accounts, etc.) account for 12 percent of GDP. If this 

government decides to finance the fiscal deficit entirely by print ing more money, what is going 

to happen is that the total currency will increase  in 25 percent (3/12). This increase  in money 

supply will push aggregate demand up, causing prices to rise. In the  long run, prices will increase 

such that real money balances remain the same. So, inflat ion will be 25 percent. 

Now assume that country B has a 0.1 percent fiscal deficit. Again, assume that we will 

finance this by print ing money. But, assume that in this country the demand for money only 

accounts for 0.1 percent of GDP. In this case, the new money printed doubles the total currency 

available  in the economy (0.1/0.1) and  inflat ion will be 100 percent. 

As should become clear, money demand  is crucial to understand the impact of the fiscal 

deficit. During the early 90's Argentina had fiscal deficit  below 1 percent and  inflat ion rates well 

above 100 percent. Today Argentina has fiscal deficits in excess o f 2.5 percent, but inflat ion is 

zero. 

Money demand depends on expectations. If agents think that domest ic currency sucks, 

they will try to dump the domestic currency in favor of the good one (usually Do llars). The 

change  in the portfolio composit ion of the agents reduces the demand for domest ic currency. 

Which  implies that for the same  fiscal deficit  inflation would be higher. But, if inflat ion  is high, 

the currency is really bad (the vicious-bad-circle). 

Financing 

Now assume that both countries have the same deficit (3 percent) and the same real balances (10 

percent). Assume that one country can finance the fiscal deficit with something different than 

money, while country B has to print money. It is clear that in the second country inflat ion is 30 

percent. Now, if the first country can finance the deficit with domest ic debt, what is the monetary 

expansion? Zero? Thus,  inflat ion should be zero too. What if they can raise foreign debt? Or use 

reserves? Well,  in all these cases, the  impact on inflat ion is zero. 

If the fiscal deficit  is financed with domestic debt, then there will be an increase  in the 

interest rate. The  idea  is that a higher  level o f domest ic debt will require bond ho lders to shift 

their portfolio toward this debt. In order to do so, the return in those assets has to increase (after 

risk had been compensated). This implies that the cost of financing the fiscal deficit with 

domestic debt is that domest ic  interest rates increase, thus, a small recession should be around 

the corner somet ime soon. 

If the fiscal deficit  is financed with foreign debt, then domest ic interest rates are little 

affected. The  intuit ion is that only the  interest rate at which the country finances  itself in 

internat ional markets will be affected. Obviously, there will be some  increase  in the domest ic 

interest rate, but it should be clear that this is more benevo lent than financing the deficit with 

domestic  interest  rates. 

Finally,  if the fiscal deficit  is financed with reserves, then not even the foreign interest 

rate is highly affected. 

What are the costs? Well, that is called balance o f payments crises. If a government 

decides to finance a  lot domest ically,  interest rates go up a lot and there is a recession. To avoid 

that, they decide to start calling City Bank. City Bank  is happy to lend at the beginning, but not 

for too long. After several rounds of irresponsibility, City Bank says enough, and the country is 

forced to use reserves. The bad thing  is that reserves have been defined uniquely in the posit ive 

numbers. This means that when they reach zero, there  is no one available to finance the 

government. They are forced to devalue. 

Inflat ion shows up, and shows up to stay for long. That is when  a stabilizat ion program 

is needed. 

2.- Types of inflation 

There are three types of inflat ion: high, medium, and  low (so original!) 

Low inflat ion rates are usually low (a deep definit ion, no?). Almo st certainly below 10 

percent per year (however, if you ask a German, 2.1% is too high). The most important 

characterist ics of this type of inflat ion is that it is the result of either  labor market pressures 

(overheat ing), public sector prices, or commodity price  inflat ion. Lets concentrate only in the 

labor market overheating. As we discussed before in the dependent economy model, an 

overheated economy will tend to push wages up, and therefore, to generate inflat ion. The 

solut ion is to cool down the economy: to reduce the aggregate demand. This is not usually easy 

to achieve (and as an example see  for how many months the US FED has been  increasing the 

interest rate as a response of tight labor markets). The problem is that the Central Bank does not 

want to overshoot and cause an unnecessary recession. The trade off is that the country is 

experiencing 2 percent  inflat ion instead of 1. This is not a big deal. So there is no reason to alarm 

your self  if  inflat ion has moved one point up, but it will be  if unemployment doubles. 

High inflat ion rates are usually very high. For example, 50 percent monthly inflat ion for 

two months is considered hyperinflat ion, 100 percent a year, etc. There is not a precise number 

for what is considered a high inflat ion, but I hope these examples will clear some of it. Now, the 

main characterist ic of high inflat ion rates  is that the inflat ion is purely a monetary effect. The 

main difference between this type o f inflat ion and the  low type  is that here the main cause  is an 

expansionary monetary policy, usually accompanied by a fiscal deficit. One of the characterist ics 

of high inflat ion rates is that the economy tends to dollarizat ion. Domestic currency has no more 

meaning as a medium of exchange, and therefore, consumers switch to foreign currency (usually 

Dollars). Dollarizat ion has the advantage that, even though in domest ic currency the  inflat ion 

rate of goods is very high, in the foreign currency, the inflat ion rate is low. 

Medium inflat ion rates are those that are neither high, nor low (I'm so good at this precise 

definit ions! No?). The main characterist ic of this type o f inflation is that everything matters: 

monetary policy,  labor market tightness, service prices, etc. Moreover, what makes this type of 

inflat ion a real problem is that inert ia becomes part of the system. Inertia means that wage 

contracts are set accordingly to past inflat ion rates, rather than expected inflat ion rates. Inertia 

puts strong constraints on the inst itutions required to stabilize prices. 

3.- Stabilization policies 

How can we reduce inflat ion? Well,  low  inflat ions are very hard to fight. We have to reduce 

domestic demand without generating a  large recession. That, by definit ion,  is an extremely hard 

task. However, when a country has  low  inflat ion one more point (or one less point) is not a huge 

deal. The central bank can deal with the  labor market pressures slowly. 

High inflat ions are, on the other hand, the easiest ones to reduce. The main reason is the 

dollarizat ion. As was ment ioned before, in Do llars the  inflat ion rate is the US one. So, if the 

Central Bank  introduces a new currency (the Rigobonian)  fixed to the Dollar, then the  inflat ion 

rate in the new currency should be  low. However, if the main cause of the monetary expansion 

was an irresponsible government and the fiscal po licy does not change after the introduction of 

the new currency, agents know that the fixed exchange rate will be abandoned  in the future. This 

means that there is an expected devaluat ion of the Rigobonian, and therefore, the inflation rate 

will be  larger than in US Dollars. The  lack of credibility generates the problem of not being able 

to reduce inflation. The quest ion is then how we deal with the problem o f credibility? (next 

sect ion) 

Medium inflat ion rates are the hardest ones to control. There are two main reasons: 

inert ia and relat ive price disequilibrium. 

First, the inert ia (which I think  is the main problem)  is the result that current 

inflat ion rate highly depends on the previous year  inflat ion rate. This is the result of both 

the behavior of the agents and the  inst itutionalizat ion of the  inert ia  in wage contracts. For 

example, there  is a clause that says that current wage increases will recover the real wage 

lost  in the previous year. This is a backward  looking indexation, generating  inertia  in the 

contracts. The stabilizat ion program in this case, not only requires the same  ingredients of 

the high inflat ionary programs but also needs  inst itutions that can break the exist ing 

inert ia  in the contracts. These  inst itutions have to be extremely credible  in order to 

achieve  its goal. 

Second, when there  is medium inflat ion, prices  in domestic currency increase  in a 

non-coordinating way (not all o f them increase at the same time). For example, assume 

that shoes' prices  increase  in odd months, while socks' prices increase  in even months. 

There  is no coordinat ion between the  industries. If suddenly prices are stopped at the 

middle of an odd month, the price of shoes is relat ively too high with respect to the price 

of socks. The reason is that shoes have  just adjust their price, and socks  is just going to do 

it (note that this does not happen in hyperinflat ion, when the prices are set in do llars and 

therefore the relat ive price  is equal to the  international relat ive price. This is equivalent of 

having pr ice  increases every day). This disequilibr ium cannot be maintained. What 

happens? Well, the relat ive price has to move, and the usual way is that the good that is 

relat ively too cheap  increases its price. In other words, there is some  inflat ion rate that 

occurs because relative prices have to adjust. This takes a couple of months, after that 

inflat ion should be small. 

4.- Credibility vs. Flexibility 

As can be seen, the main problem of reducing medium and high  inflat ion  is the credibility of the 

new regime. How is credibility achieved? By inst itutions. What is the cost of achieving the 

credibility? The  lack of flexibility. Let me formalize these. 

The main advantage of fixed regimes  is not the facilitat ion of trade or the hedging,  is the 

price stability, credibility and the fiscal discipline  it  imposes. The disadvantage  is that, 

sometimes,  it will be beneficial for the economy to devalue (a real wage decline  is needed to 

achieve equilibrium). Lets see the trade-off: 

Assume a country has to stabilize  its price  level. Assume the government chooses 

a very rigid  inst itution (a currency board, or a single currency union). Agents know that 

the probability o f devaluat ion is small in this environment, and therefore, domest ic 

inflat ion drops dramat ically. Moreover, to maintain the currency and pr ice stability 

unions, consumers, and po lit icians are willing to make sacrifices and reform, privat ize, 

and have a more market oriented economy. Therefore, fiscal discipline  is guaranteed. 

This sounds like paradise!!! Why do not all countries have a single currency? Well, there 

are two costs: reduction of sovereignty and flexibility (which in the end are  just the 

same). 

Assume there  is a bad shock to  the government revenues. The government has to 

decide whether or not to adjust the expenditures. A t ight monetary policy implies that the 

fiscal defic it has to be  financed through bonds (domest ic or foreign). The market will 

punish the  increase  in debt by higher  interest rate, the real exchange rate will appreciate, 

the aggregate demand will fall, and therefore, a fiscal authority will think twice (or 

several t imes)  before running a deficit  if  it knows that the exchange rate will be 

maintained. On the other hand,  if the fiscal authority knows that the central bank will 

devalue the currency to maintain the level o f reserves or interest rates, then a fiscal deficit 

implies a depreciation o f the exchange rate. In this case,  if the cost of adjust ing the 

expenditure  is larger than the social cost of the devaluat ion (for the polit ician), then no 

adjustment takes place. 

You see, this is a good example because:  if the source of the revenue shock  is 

irresponsibility then a  fixed exchange rate is great!!! The bad behavior today will require 

an effort from the government today to adjust: discip line  in the end  is guaranteed, and 

that is what we want when we are dealing with irresponsibility. However, if the source of 

the shock  is an earthquake, it  is not clear that today we want to reduce expenditures. In 

fact, maybe we want to increase them. Maybe we want to take care of the people under 

distress and offer some transfer to solve their problems. Maybe the best alternative  is to 

socialize the  losses through  inflat ion and/or devaluat ion. In other words, maybe the 

source of the fiscal shock is bad  luck, which means that in this situat ion, the economy is 

poorer and the solution is to reduce the real wage: either through devaluat ion,  inflat ion, or 

both. In this case, the fixed exchange rate is a bad  idea: the regime is not allowing the 

depreciat ion or inflat ion to take place. Therefore, the only way o f reducing the real wage 

is through a reduction of the NOMINAL wages. In other words, the economy needs 

unemployment. If the labor market is very flexible, the unemployment goes up, and 

people are hired at a lower wage. However, if there are frict ions  in the  labor market, this 

adjustment might take a long t ime (and  in the case of France even decades). 

In summary,  fixed exchange rates (through rigid  inst itutions) have the advantage of 

bringing stability in prices from abroad, but it has the disadvantage that (if the  labor market is not 

flexible enough) unemployment will adjust in a bad event. In the presence of a "bad" shock, a 

more  lax regime allows  for some devaluat ion. The real wage  falls  immediately, the  losses are 

recognized today, and the economy moves on. On the other hand,  in a rigid regime devaluat ion is 

not a possibility. The escape valve  is unemployment, and therefore the economy spreads through 

time the costs of today shocks. The difference between these two paths  is that in the first one the 

losses are recognized  immediately, while  in the second one, the  losses are reflected in 

unemployment and  later in real wages. When "real bad" things happen, having the flexibility to 

move the exchange rate will be better. The  idea  is that, in the end the economy will be  in the 

same point with both regimes, so what is the benefit of delaying what everybody knows is go ing 

to happen? Take the loss today and move on. The problem is the definit ion or "real bad" stuff. 

What actually is "real bad"? an earthquake  is far too trivial. Is a socail demonstration too bad? Is 

14 percent unemployment too bad? When is actually allowable fiscal st imulus? The answer to 

these quest ions is unclear. 

This  is the trade-off between flexibility and credibility.  Inflexible  inst itutions buy 

credibility (given that their commitments are very likely to be held) but pay by the  lack of 

flexibility when real shocks happen. 

5.- Fixing the exchange rate 

There are several ways in which you can fix the exchange rate. We can have a promise from the 

president of the central bank (CB) to a band, we can have the promise of the CB to a fixed 

exchange rate, we can have a Currency Board, we can have no domestic currency (only do llars, 

or a single currency), or we can declare our self part of the other country (became a co lony). 

Flexibility decreases through out all these measures, credibility increases. For example,  if 

a small country declares a war to US (and looses, not like the Peter Seller's movie), and  in the 

end we become part of US. What you think  is the probability that our currency will devalue with 

respect  to the Dollar? Zero!!! However, we have  lost some  flexibility, and  in this case (which is 

an extreme) we have even lost part (sorry, all) of our sovereignty. 

On the other hand, assume the president of the central bank promise that he  is not going 

to devalue. Well, at the beginning we believe the promise because  it is the President of the 

Central Bank. However, imagine that a couple of months in the road you see  in the TV that the 

president of the central bank  issues a statement that there will be no devaluat ion. Who was 

talking about devaluat ion? (you say) You start getting worried and fo llowing the exchange rate 

closer. The next month the statement is "we will never, never, NEVER devalue our currency" 

When the president of the central bank says three times never, the devaluat ion was already 

discussed  in directory. You see, promises can be broken, and the cost of breaking them is small. 

Is just  the reputation of one  individual who  is going to leave the  inst itution  in the  future (and 

after this event, probably very soon). 

Currency Board. 

What  is a currency board? A currency board is a set of strict rules for the central bank. The  idea 

is that no money creation can occur without the counter part increase  in reserves. This means that 

the money base  is fully backed by reserves. Moreover, it means that the central bank  is unable to 

buy or sell public debt. Therefore, there is no role for monetary policy. There are several types of 

currency board, more or less backed money. In the end all o f them are some combinat ion of this 

set of rules. 

What are the benefits? First, there  is low probability that the fiscal deficit will be financed 

with monetary  inject ion:  inflat ion falls. The credibility o f the regime  is high  in this respect. 

Second, the fiscal deficit will be financed  in the open market by issuing bonds. The market will 

punish bad behavior of the government by increasing the  interest rate, and therefore, encouraging 

fiscal responsibility. Third, the reform process has to be accelerated. This is in line with the fiscal 

responsibility. Usually to achieve the first one the economy needs privat ization, social security 

reform, etc. The fact that there  is no room for fiscal deficit  forces government and congress to 

approve and accelerate the process of reform. 

What are the costs? Well,  if there  is a  fiscal shock interest rate will go up and the 

financial sector will suffer. Second, unemployment  is the escape valve (as before). Third, how 

you deal with inflat ion if it didn't come down at a reasonable speed? How you deal with the real 

exchange rate appreciat ion? 

As everything, there are benefits and costs. Currency board is a good ingredient to 

stabilization. A very good one! However, is quite naive to think that the fiscal authority will 

discipline  itself by changing the monetary regime. I think that, in a country like Indonesia,  in the 

end the fiscal authority will dominate this fight and the central bank will have to give up. In these 

type of country, a currency board can not guarantee a healthy financial sector, a flexible  labor 

market, or fiscal responsibility. However, the people  in favor of currency board will tell you that 

those things can only be achieved  if the pressures on the economy are so high that labor reform, 

financial reform, and fiscal responsibility are the only alternat ives to avoid the collapse. Well, 

this  is a high bet!!! The economy is betting on the monetary po licy disciplining  fiscal,  labor and 

financial sectors. The question is then, are we sure this can happen?
