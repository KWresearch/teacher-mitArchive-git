As you probably noticed, the most important aspect of the news is that they interview me. 
And because I’m so arrogant, I decided to have this wire-news as your problem set. It 
really doesn’t matter what the content is. Just the fact that it is me, me, me, me, and only 
and always, me.  
 
Because I’m forced to ask a question, here you have it: Please react to one the following 
questions. Please, answer within the ISLM framework (and the multiplier babysitter 
example if needed).  
 
ANSWER ONLY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING TWO QUESTIONS: 
 

1.  Is the Central Bank doing the right policy? in which sense do you agree or 
disagree with the FED? 

 
2.  Should the FED be concerned with the fiscal deficit? Why?
