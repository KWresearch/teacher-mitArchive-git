MORE ISLM: 

Bonnet_land is a country that has performed appropriately in the last decades (some growth). Its major industry 
is the manufacturing of hats. However, things are going bad lately. There is a recession, they have price 
deflation, nominal interest rates are low, but real interest rates (the difference between nominal rates and the 
inflation rate) are large. On top of everything, the fiscal accounts have deteriorated. The sovereign debt is 
increasing and the prognosis is bad. 

You have just being elected to office. 

1.- What is you priority? (Choose only ONE objective) 

2.- Design a fiscal (expenditure and taxes) and monetary (interest rates) policy consistent with that objective. 
Explain your policy in the ISLM framework. 

3.- What are the implications for the other variables that you have not considered as your objectives: Talk about 
output, inflation, interest rates, and fiscal deficit. 

4.- Assume that the Central Banker in your Bonet_Land suddenly pledges alliance to the Venezuelan Flag - 
which is a clear indication that he or she is crazy. Assume that right after that the Central Bank starts printing 
money without stop - so much that the economy is literally flooded. What could be done? (Other than kicking 
out the President of the Central Bank) 

BB-NN: 

Bonnet_land is a country that has performed appropriately in the last decades. Its major industry is the 
manufacturing of hats. The exports had been growing dramatically reflecting the increases in productivity that 
the industry had experienced in the past 30 years. The growth rate of the GDP per capital has also been quite 
acceptable. Moreover, all this growth has been achieved with very responsible fiscal behavior (deficits are 
usually smaller than 1 percent of GDP), and low unemployment. This has allowed the monetary authority to 
maintain a fixed exchange rate for a very long time. Since the seventies the economy has been characterized by 
low inflation, relatively low interest rates, and equilibrium in the current account (the current account has been 
consistently positive).  

However, in the later part of the 90's growth has declined and unemployment has started to increase. The 
current account has also deteriorated and it is now barely positive. See table for all the data.

The increase in unemployment has been associated with the current welfare state and the decrease in the growth 
rate. In particular, several important economists in the country blame the unemployment insurance as the main 
source of the problem. Prof. Know_a_lot_bon describes the situation as: "The current welfare state was 
designed for a growing economy. When this stopped, and real wages stagnated, and unemployment insurance 
became too attractive. Neither workers, nor firms, have incentives to create the necessary jobs to accommodate 
the unemployed"  

A new president, Cap Boater, has taken office recently. He is crying for advise, and he has called you for help.  

 

1.- Give a diagnostic of the current situation of the economy in the BB-NN map. 

 

 

What would you do if you want to return immediately to the equilibrium (Hint: you will need at least two 
policies to move the economy directly to equilibrium)? Only describe fiscal, monetary and exchange rate 
policy. 

 

2.- What are the benefits and costs of each of your policies: Explain what each one does. 

 

 

3.- Assume that no policies have been implemented yet. When you arrive to the country to advise the 
government, suddenly, there is a riot in the Capital. In fact, the current situation of large unemployment has 
driven a drop in the wage in dollars and people are starting to complain.  

The head of the Union, Pissed_My_Hood, is quite frustrated with the situation of their workers: "We cannot 
find a place to work, our wages are coming down, the people are dying, the people are hungry. What you expect 
them to do? Their economic situation is so bad that they are moving to Shirt_land" (Shirt_land is a really crummy 
country East of Bonet_land) 

Draw the situation of the economy and the social peace line.  

How you would change the policies you advised before (question 1)? 

 

 

4.- Assume that we are in the original situation (before any policy, but with the riots) and assume that an 
earthquake hits the country. Half of the capital is lost and production drops dramatically. The current account 
turns into a severe deficit.  

Several analysts have indicated that the current account deficit is dangerous for the viability of the country. As 
was mentioned by Prof. Iam Sodepres: "The current account deficit, together with a slow down in growth, and 
an increasing fiscal deficit indicates that this economy is going to hit the wall. When? I do not know, but they 
are going to hit it hard." 

Draw in the BB-NN what is the implication of the natural disaster (assume the lines in the diagram are the 
original lines before the earthquake).  

What are your policy recommendations in terms of monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies? (remember that 
you have the social peace line from the previous question)
