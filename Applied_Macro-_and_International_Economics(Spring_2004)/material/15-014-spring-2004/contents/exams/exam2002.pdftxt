It was a pleasure to spend time with you guys this semester. I learned a lot from our discussions, and I 
appreciate all the time and effort you gave. There is an important theorem in life that says that good things 
always happen, the problem is that they occur mostly in the end. This was not the case in this class. We had the 
good things at the beginning, and, unfortunately, the bad things in the end. So, here is the exam. 

You have 1 hour and 20 minutes. The points of each question are indicated in italic-bold at the beginning of 
each of them. The total points in the exam are 100. Answer all questions in the space provided. I really do not 
think that you need more. However, if you need more space you can use the back of the pages. 

I hope our paths will cross again (at least for a coffee) and remember that wherever your decisions might take 
you, I'm always an e-mail-away. It was an honor to share the room with you.  

Good luck. 

The exam describes a fictitious country that has some problems, and asks for your advice.  

After ages of domination by the French and the Spanish, the new country of Messedup has been created. The 
expectations are high. The new president, Screwme Allyouwant, is an extremely charismatic leader. Indeed, he 
has been acknowledged internationally as one of the best leaders in the developing world. In his first speech to 
the nation he said: 

Our country is approaching a crossroad. We have to take care of our people: the poor, the unemployed, 
and the uneducated. Nobody should be left behind, as Al Gore, once said. We have to increase our 
production and exports to solve, for once and for all, the current account deficit that has been draining 
our national treasures.  

It is clear that our mayor exports are coming from the already famous Messies. However, we cannot 
progress, we cannot survive, we cannot become a respectable nation such as Venezuela (life is so 
relative, no?) if we continue our strong dependence on a single manufacturing product. We have to 
invest in the other things we do well, such as soap operas about Messies, movies about Messies, cloths 
for Messies, food for Messies, and finally, and more importantly, a male for the Messies. 

We will take over the world! This is our future!  

 

The first measures included the creation of a currency that was going to be fixed to the US Dollar at one to one. 
Obviously the Central Bank was in charge of protecting both the currency and price stability (or on other words, 
inflation). The president of the Central Bank, Iam Totallygerman, is regarded as a very responsible central 
banker. 

Several key appointments occurred in the administration. To take care of labor and social issues Jean Pierre 
Iamnotfrench, an extremely conservative economist, took over all social aspects of the economy. He was 
named the Secretary of Labor. The secretary of the treasury was offered to Guacamole Heissomexican. He and 
his advisor, Ihave Noidea, are in charge of supervising the overall development program. 

 

 

1.- [10 pts] Give a diagnostic of the current situation of the economy in the BB-NN map (no explanation is 
needed). The original point should be denoted as A. 

 

2.- [10 pts] What would you do if you want to return immediately to the equilibrium (Hint: only talk about 
fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policy)? (Use the space available here. No more). 

 

3.- [10 pts] However, because the president did not take this class, he was unable to implement your policy. He, 
on the other hand, decided to follow the advise of his Secretary of Treasury and the internationally recognized 
economist Prof. Ihave Noidea. They pushed for an aggressive fiscal expansion to take care of social problems. 
What happens to the economy? Where is it moving and what happens to unemployment and the current account 
immediately? Denote the new point of the economy as B. 

 

 

 

 

Unemployment goes:    

 

Current Account Deficit goes: 

up 

up 

      

      

 

 

down 

      

down 

      

 

 

4.- [10 pts] If the economy continues in this strategy, what is going to happen?  

 

5.- [15 pts] President Allyouwant reacted to this situation in the following manner 

Professor Noidea screwed all our country, even me. I have asked the resignation of Heissomexican. We 
are disappointed. And certainly something has to be done. The degree of poverty of our nation has 
increased to intolerable levels. Our young nation has to change direction; the direction of prosperity. I’m 
calling You to solve the problems of our great country. 

By the way, You is you. Yes, you, the one that is answering the exam.  

What would You do in terms of monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policy? Denote the new equilibrium as C 
and assume the schedules drawn are the original ones. (explain) 

 

 

6.- [15 pts] Actually, when you presented your program before congress, the reaction of the Spanish descendent 
Maria Unioneta, head of the labor union, said 

The program is unacceptable. We are not striking right now because is lunch time, and our tradition 
suggests that we have to wait until after the Siesta. But we will! We Will!  

What would you do in terms of reforms (do not name more than ONE reform)? What would be the effect of this 
in the BB-NN model? Denote the new equilibrium as D and assume the schedules drawn are the original ones. 

 

 

7.- [30 pts] The bad luck of the Messedupeans continues. There has been a terrible disaster. The Secretary of 
Labor suddenly became French. He implemented a dramatically damaging policy: 

“Frrom now onn, evrery budy in the labor markét weel have to eat due pieces of lovely French cheese”.  

Which translated to Messdupean means  

“From now on, everybody in the labor market will have to eat two pieces of bad French cheese”. 

What is the implication of this policy if it is actually binding? In other words, assume that now workers and 
consumers are forced to eat more cheese than before. What are the consequences, and what would you do in 
terms of fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policy? (So, we cannot kick the guy out of the country).
