Final Exam 15.012 

Sections A & B 

It was a pleasure to spend time with you guys this semester. I learned a lot from our discussions and I really 
appreciate all the time and effort you gave. The ugly part, of course, is my fault and it is the exam. I hope 
that it will contribute to your learning process in the same way that the course has.  

You have 1 hour and 20 minutes. The points of each question are indicated in italic-bold at the beginning of 
each of them. The total points in the exam are 100. Answer all questions in the space provided. I really do 
not think that you need more. 

I hope our paths will cross again (at least for a coffee) and remember that wherever you are I'm always an 
e-mail-away. It was an honor to share the room with you.  

Good luck.

5)  A country is deciding to reform.  
     The situation of the economy is the following: The country is coming from years of governmental 
intervention (import substitution) and the industrial park is completely inadequate for today's global 
conditions.  
     The fiscal deficit is huge (8% of GDP) and the current account is also in deficit (3%) and reserves 
are decreasing rapidly. Measures of poverty are incredibly bad and deteriorating in the last 10 years. 
Education attendance is low and illiteracy is high. Finally growth has stopped and today the recession 
is rampant (so is unemployment).  
     There are capital controls that have been extremely effective (but they have implied a large interest 
rate) and the import substitution policies have been accompanied by high tariffs. The exchange rate for 
the moment, is a currency board fixed to the US dollar. 
     The country has a long history of stable democracy, and there has been recently effort to 
decentralize health and education. 

Choose what would be the objective of your policy? This should be maintained through out all the 
question. 

a)  Growth 

b)  Encourage FDI 

c)  Solve the problem of the balance of payments and unemployment 

d)  Solve the problem of the balance of payments and implement policies to solve poverty 

e)  Take care of growth, employment and poverty  

[10 pts] What policies would you choose (only 5) that are consistent with the objective you indicated 
above.

.... continue from question 5. 

[12 pts] Given the experiences of China, Mexico, Uganda and Russia, how would you classify the 
following conditions in the country (helping or not the process of reform, and briefly explain why). 

•  The country has a long history of stable democracy, however there have been recently 
important efforts to decentralize. 
 
             Help               Does not help               Does not matter 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

•  There are important restrictions to capital inflows as the result of previous speculative attacks 
the country suffered. They are mainly short run restrictions. 
 
             Help               Does not help               Does not matter 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

•  The exchange rate regime is currently a currency board.  
 
             Help               Does not help               Does not matter 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

6) 

[36 pts] What are the benefits and costs of fixing the exchange rate (or the promise to fixing it in the 
future)? Indicate three of each and then briefly explain why it is a cost or benefit.
