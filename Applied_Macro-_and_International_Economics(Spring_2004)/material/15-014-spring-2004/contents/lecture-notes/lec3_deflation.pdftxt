The Great Depression 
 
In this case we saw how the fall in asset prices and consumer prices can be devastating 
for an economy. Indeed, most of the recessions that are accompanied by deflation have 
this characteristic. USA in the 1930’s, Japan in the 1990’s and Argentina now are only 
some of the examples we will see where this mechanisms is at work. 
 
Let me go over the deflationary mechanism instead of summarizing the specifics of the 
case. You should take a look at the handout of the babysitter cooperative (The Multiplier) 
because a lot of the intuition is there too.  
 
The first channel is the one that comes from the standard multiplier. A drop in prices 
delays consumption that increases inventories. In the end, the firms are forced to sell their 
stock at a lower price, further reducing prices. 
 
Note that if consumers get depressed and think there is a chance that prices might fall, 
then consumption is delayed and prices drop, confirming the consumer’s fears. In other 
words, this is a multiple equilibrium model. If consumers are excited, consumption is 
high and there are incentives for consumption to remain high. If consumers are 
depressed, consumption is low, and there are incentives to keep it low.

This is not the end of the story given that if the drop in prices persists, then firms have 
lower profits, bankruptcy goes up. Therefore, output falls and unemployment increases.

As can be seen, here we also have all the mechanisms in the economy reinforcing them 
self. The drop in consumption makes output to go down, which reduces income, which 
further reduces consumption. This is the same mechanism we derived in the babysitter 
cooperative. 
 
Note that the vicious cycle can start with a drop in prices (deflation), or a change in the 
mood of consumers (consumer confidence, or political crisis), or a drop in output (a 
natural disaster), or an increase in bankruptcy (change in accounting standards), or a 
reduction in income (an unnecessary increase in taxes). It really doesn’t matter  who 
starts the cycle, there is very little stopping it. 
 
This mechanism also implies that the fiscal accounts and the health in the banking sector 
are going to be deteriorated.  
 
The story through the banking sector goes something like this. Bankruptcy goes up which 
implies that measures of performance in the banking sector deteriorate: specifically, Non-
Performing-Loans goes up. The banks have credit risk and therefore the health of their 
portfolio deteriorates. In the end, credit is reduced and overall investment in the economy 
falls. This, further, implies that there is a drop in output, which creates more bankruptcy, 
and the cycle starts all over again. Indeed, the vicious cycle works to exacerbate the 
crisis.

The story through the fiscal accounts is that a drop in output reduces the tax collection 
(and also increases the expenditures associated with the recession and the 
unemployment). Both effects deteriorate the fiscal deficit. The increase in government 
financing increases the interest rate, which further reduces the investment and the output.  
 
Again, note that the crisis can be triggered by any of the variables we are modeling. It can 
start with a fiscal problem (a Brazilian, sorry I meant an irresponsible government), it can 
start in the banking sector (reducing credit), or it can start with any of the triggers we 
discussed before. 
 
Finally, you can have exactly the same vicious cycle starting from an asset price fall. In 
this case a drop in asset prices creates a loss in wealth in market participants. They are 
forced, therefore, to sell part of their portfolio, depressing prices in the market even 
further. 

 
If part of those assets are held by the financial sector. Then, the banks experience losses, 
credit is lowered, and investment drops. Once output has fallen, all the shocks are spread 
through out the whole economy.

Imagine that we want to compare several economies by looking at the following 
indicators: output growth, unemployment, investment, consumption, fiscal deficit, health 
of the financial sector (NPL), credit expansion, interest rates, consumer prices, and stock 
market prices.  

 

 
In this description of the economy, once something goes busted, the rest is a 
consequence. If the economy has this type of recession, then the day output is not 
growing, unemployment is high, investment has disappeared, consumption is delayed, 
fiscal deficits are large, the banking sector is weak, there is no credit to new firms, and 
the prices of both consumers and stock markets are falling.  
 
This is the typical outlook of a recession in developed markets.  
 
Again, what can trigger it? Anything! It can be consumer confidence reducing 
consumption first. It can be an asset price bubble going burst. It can be a worse 
investment environment. It can be bad luck and output loss. It can be bad monetary 
policy increasing unnecessarily the interest rate. It can be anything. In the end, they all 
look the same.
