The set of questions below will help students focus on the important points in
each of the cases. More importantly, the questions in italics are related to
current events. It does not make any sense to study what has happened in the
past if we cannot learn something from it, and apply it to today's problems.
This is the way Prof. Rigobon wants to set up the class discussions.

       The German
       Hyperinflation of
       1923
       As Germany lost
       World War I, the
       empire of William
       II gave way to the
       democratic Weimar
       Republic. The
       first reading (by
       Johj Rodes)
       describes the
       political
       situation in
       Germany and the
       reparations
       demanded by
       Allies. The

       fourth readings    What caused the German Hyperinflation?

       president's
       explanation for
       the Bundesbank's
       actions. The final
       reading gives
       Stopler's
       description of the
       stabilization of
       November 1923.
       Much of the
       information about
       the episode can be
       found in the
       exhibits at the
       end.

       Our objective in

Transition Economies and Africa
       Russia - 1994
       On December 12,
       1993, the Russian
       people cast their
       votes in the first
       open multiparty
       election in
       Russian history.
       The election was a
       referendum on
       Yeltsin's reform

Trade Issues
       Boeing Versus
