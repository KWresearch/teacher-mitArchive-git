Fiscal Multiplier: 
The mystery of the babysitting cooperative: the true story. 

 
There was a group of young couples in Washington (all lawyers) that considered that 
babysitting was kind of expensive. Therefore, they decided to create a cooperative and 
swap kids such that a friend would take care of the kids for free instead of paying. In 
order to assure fairness they decided to create some coupons (one kid - one hour). They 
gave each couple in the cooperative some coupons and those were used when the couple 
decided to go out. The cooperative started working just fine. However, at some time, one 
couple decided that they were going to accumulate some coupons in case an unexpected 
party could show up – obviously this couple was Venezuelan. You know, we love to 
party for more than 24 hours and you need a lot of coupons in case they the event shows 
up without planning.  
 
What happened? Well, all the couples tried to do the same. If there were 10 coupons per 
family it is impossible to provide each family with more than that on average. Therefore, 
in the end, they were all sitting in their homes, not going out, and not been able to get 
their coupons. Quite unhappy!!! 
 
What did they do? They try to kill the Venezuelan family, but as weed, they can’t kill us. 
So, given that they were all lawyers they decided to rewrite the law: "from now on, every 
couple that belongs to the cooperative must go out and have fun at least once a week" 
This forced the couples to go out, the coupons started to circulate and the cooperative 
worked. 
 
We know an alternative. You can issue new coupons. 10 per couple. In that way 
everybody would have the required coupons that they decided and the cooperative would 
have been saved. Note that the first alternative is equivalent to fiscal policy, while the 
second one is monetary policy.  
 
Why these policies work in this problem? The multiplier...

One striking feature is that this model has the implication that the more you save (more 
coupons you accumulate), the lower the demand is and therefore, the smaller the 
multiplier is. Quite a counter intuitive implication, no? At least, in comparison to what 
our moms have told us all our lives. 
 
Lets see how each policy works in this diagram. 
 

Fiscal Policy: 
We studied three fiscal policies: 
• 
Tax Cuts on individuals, usually income taxes.  
• 
Tax cuts on investment and firms usually called Investment Tax Credits,  
• 
Increases in Expenditure. 
 
 

FP: Investment Tax Incentives

FP: Increase in Expenditure

FP: Tax Cut

 

 

Monetary Policy: 
In this case we have either an increase in money supply (in the baby sitter example this 
implies a larger income) or a reduction in the interest rate (which will increase 
investment).
