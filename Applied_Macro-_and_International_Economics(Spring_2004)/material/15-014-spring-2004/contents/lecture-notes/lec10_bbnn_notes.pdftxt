The BB-NN Model 

 

1.  Real Exchange Rate Determination – Introduction  

This model allows us to determine the real exchange rate for an economy. What is the real exchange rate? 
What is the nominal exchange rate? What are the differences and the similarities? The nominal exchange 
rate refers to the price at which two currencies are exchanged (1800 Italian Liras for 1 US dollar). On the 
other hand, the real exchange rate refers to the relative costs of similar goods in two different countries. In 
general, we are interested in the relative wages, since we almost always assume that capital has a high 
international mobility (e.g., we are assuming that capital is rewarded at the same risk-adjusted rate in all 
countries.) This simplifying assumption allows us to focus the model on the labor market. However, there 
are generalizations that include external capital, and the conclusions are practically the same. 

The  equilibrium  real  exchange  rate  is  defined  as  the  rate  that  results  in  equilibrium  both  in  the 
labor  market  and  in  the  balance  of  payments.    It  is  important  to  understand  that  the  real  exchange  rate 
refers to a certain extent to the degree of competitiveness of the economy. Therefore, it is a relative rather 
than a nominal price. 

2.  The Model 

The BBNN will allow us to determine the real exchange rate by considering the equilibrium conditions in 
the balance of payments and in the labor market. 

Let’s  suppose  that  we  want  to  draw  (in  a  graph)  a  curve  that  represents  the  equilibrium  in  the 
balance of payments  (external equilibrium). On  the “x” axis we plot  the country’s aggregate demand and 
on the “y” axis we plot a measure of competitiveness.

Aggregate Demand

 

Let’s  suppose  that  point  “a”  is  a  point  of  equilibrium  in  the  balance  of  payments.  If  at  this  point 
we increase competitiveness, keeping the same aggregate demand, we will obtain a surplus in the balance 
of  payments.  The  external  sector  is  more  competitive  and  therefore  exports  increase.  Moreover,  import 
prices  go  up  and  demand  falls,  improving  even  more  the  external  accounts.  If  at  point  “a”  we  increase 
aggregate  demand,  keeping  the  same  level  of  competitiveness,  we  will  consequently  raise  imports 
(consumption  of  imported  goods)  and  reduce  exports  (more  domestic  goods  are  consumed  and  therefore 
less are available for export). This generates a deficit in the balance of payments. 

Going  up  (north)  we  have  a  situation  of  surplus,  while  to  the  right  (east)  we  have  a  situation  of 
deficit.  If  we  move  between  the  point  of  surplus  and  the  point  of  deficit,  we  must  cross  the  zero 
(equilibrium  in  the  balance  of  payments).  In  other  words,  the  curve  representing  the  equilibrium  in  the 
balance of payments has a positive slope.

Aggregate Demand

 

In the same way, we can derive a curve describing the equilibrium in the labor market. First, let’s 
remember  that  equilibrium  in  the  labor  market  means  that  the  level  of  unemployment  is  such  that  there 
are  no  pressures  to  change  wages.  This  rate  of  unemployment  is  known  as  the  natural  rate  of 
unemployment.  We  say  that  we  are  in  a  situation  of  unemployment  when  there  are  pressures  to  reduce 
wages. Conversely, overheating means that there are pressures to raise wages. 

Let’s  suppose  that  at  point  “b”  there  is  equilibrium  in  the  labor  market.  If  we  lower 
competitiveness  keeping  the  same  aggregate  demand,  some  firms  that  used  to  export  will  go  bankrupt, 
resulting  in  unemployment.  On  the  other  hand,  if  we  keep  the  same  level  of  competitiveness  (and 
therefore  of  production)  and  increase  aggregate  demand,  demand  for  domestic  goods  increases  and 
therefore  there  are  pressures  in  the  labor market  to  hire  more  workers.  Unemployment  is  reduced  below 
the “natural rate of unemployment”, causing overheating.

Going  down  (south)  we  have  a  situation  of  unemployment,  while  to  the  right  (east)  we  have  a 
situation  of  overheating.    If  we  move  between  the  point  of  unemployment  and  the  point  of  overheating, 
we  must  encounter  a  point  of  equilibrium  in  the  labor  market.  This  means  that  the  equilibrium  curve  is 
downward  sloping. With  the  two curves, we can determine what  is  the  real exchange  rate consistent with 
equilibrium  in  the  balance  of  payments  (external  equilibrium)  and  equilibrium  in  the  labor  market.  We 
will call the labor market equilibrium curve “NN”, and the external market equilibrium curve “BB”.

These  curves  define  the  equilibrium  and  four  regions.  Economies  can  have  unemployment  or 
overheating in the labor market, and deficit or surplus in the external accounts. Notice that this will allow 
us  to  determine  (diagnose)  where  economies  lie  on  this  map.  For  example,  Venezuela  in  1997  has  high 
unemployment  and  a  small  surplus  in  the  external  accounts.  This  means  that  the  economy  is  located 
below the NN and just above the BB curve. 

2.1.  Real exchange rate 

We  say  that  the  real  exchange  rate  is  appreciated  when  the  economy  is  located  below  the  equilibrium 
exchange  rate  (i.e.  the  economy  is  not  competitive),  while  we  say  that  the  real  exchange  rate  is 
depreciated when the economy is above the equilibrium (i.e. it is competitive). 

These  reasons  denote  the  disequilibria  that  economies  can  suffer.  It  is  important  that  we  always 
use disequilibria to diagnose where economies stand. Once diagnosed, we can decide what to do. 

We  will  denote  the  real  exchange  rate  “e/w”  as  a  measure  of  competitiveness,  where  “e”  is  the 
nominal  exchange  rate  and  “w”  is  the  nominal  wage.  (When  we  say  that  this  is  a  measure  of 
competitiveness, we  are  supposing  that  the  only  production  factor  is  labor. This  is  another  simplification 
that  does  not  change  the  results.)  The  idea  is  that  the  real  exchange  rate  is  the  inverse  of  the  wage  in 
dollars.  It  is  logical  to  suppose  that a country  that has a higher dollar wage  is  less  competitive. Therefore 
the inverse of the dollar wage is a measure of competitiveness. 

3.  What To Do as a Finance Minister? 

Now,  let’s  suppose  that  we  don’t  like  where  the  economy  is  located  (for  instance  there  is  too  much 
unemployment,  etc.) What  can we  do? There  are  two  alternatives:  do  something  or  do  nothing. Let’s  see 
the first. 

Movements  in  aggregate  demand  (“x”  axis)  can  be  obtained  by  means  of  expansionary  fiscal  or 
monetary  policies.  Movements  in  competitiveness  can  be  obtained  by  changing  wages  or  the  nominal 
exchange rate.  

Let’s suppose  that wages are relatively rigid  in the short run. The question  then becomes whether 
there exists any fiscal, monetary or foreign exchange policy that we can follow to cure the disequilibria of 
an  economy.  The  answer  is  yes.  If  we  implement  an  expansionary  fiscal  or  monetary  policy,  aggregate 
demand  will  increase,  at  least  in  the  short  run.  On  the  contrary,  a  contractionary  policy  will  reduce 
aggregate demand. This conclusion comes from the IS-LM model. 

On  the other hand, a nominal devaluation (“e”  increases)  translates  into a real devaluation (“e/w” 
increases)  if  the wages are  fixed.  In other words,  if an economy has unemployment and presents a deficit 

in  the balance of payments,  the government must devalue  the currency.  If an economy  is  in a situation of 
unemployment  and  there  is  a  surplus  in  the balance of payments,  an  expansionary  fiscal policy  is needed 
to return to equilibrium. We have two instruments: one allows us to move the economy horizontally from 
the right to the left, and the other allows us to move it vertically from the bottom to the top of the map. 

Obviously, the world is much more complex than this description. Yet this basic model represents 
with  good  approximation  what  is  happening  to  an  economy.  In  the  following  pages,  we  will  see  that 
nominal devaluations are not necessarily effective  in  real  terms and  that controlling   aggregate demand  is 
not always easy. Nonetheless, the main aspects of an economy are summarized by the model variables. 

4.  What Does the Economy Do by Itself? Dynamic Properties 

Let’s  suppose  that  the government does  not  intervene.  Is  there  any mechanism  that  leads  the  economy  to 
equilibrium, or will  it always stay  in disequilibrium? The answer  is an economy will autonomously move 
to  equilibrium.  Let’s  suppose  that  we  have  a  fixed  exchange  rate  system.  If  we  are  in  a  situation  of 
unemployment,  the  wages  tend  to  decrease.  Therefore,  we  are  experiencing  a  real  depreciation  (“e/w” 
increases.) On the contrary, if an economy is overheating, the wages tend to go up and, as a consequence, 
we obtain a real appreciation (“e/w” decreases.) 

NN

e /w

D

 

Notice that economic forces push the real exchange rate to the level corresponding to equilibrium 
in the labor market. In other words, the labor market has internal mechanisms that lead to the equilibrium. 

On  the  other  hand,  if  we  have  a  deficit  in  the  balance  of  payments,  we  will  have  a  monetary 
mechanism  (from  the  IS-LM)  that  will  intervene  on  aggregate  demand.  When  there  is  a  deficit  in  the 
balance  of  payments,  international  reserves  fall  and  therefore  the  monetary  base  falls.  In  the  absence  of 
fiscal policy changes,  this  is  equivalent  to  a  restrictive monetary policy. There  is  a monetary  contraction, 
the  interest  rate  increases  and  output  and  aggregate  demand  fall.  (In  other  words,  balance  of  payment 
deficits make the citizens of the country poorer, therefore consumption will decrease (and this will reduce 
aggregate demand).) The opposite happens when there is a surplus. 

e /w

D

 

Putting  the  two dynamics  together, we can see  that  the economy will approach equilibrium along 
a  spiral  path.  An  important  question  is  how  long  it  takes  for  an  economy  to  trace  the  whole  path.  The 
answer is that normally it takes a long time (many years.) 

NN

BB

e /w

In  other  words,  if  an  economy  has  a  problem  of  real  exchange  rate  appreciation,  with 
unemployment  and  balance  of  payments  deficit,  it  will  tend  to  go  through  a  recession  (more 
unemployment) for a long time. How can we fix this? With a devaluation! 

D

 

5.  Devaluation 

What  happens  when  we  have  an  appreciation  and  we  devalue?  If  we  don’t  devalue,  the  economy  will 
approach equilibrium along a spiral path, according to the dynamics described above. 

NN

BB

e /w

But  if  we  devalue  the  economy  will  move  directly  from  its  initial  point  to  the  real  exchange  rate 
equilibrium.  What  shall  we  do?  Obviously,  the  first  alternative  is  longer,  but  does  not  require  a 
devaluation,  while  the  second  path  is  shorter  but  requires  a  devaluation.  As  we  will  see  later,  there  are 

D

 

conditions under which nominal devaluations are not very effective, and therefore not so desirable. If that 
is the situation of a country, there is no solution other than following the longer path. 

NN

BB

Analogously, if we have a problem of unemployment accompanied by surplus in the balance of payments, 
we  can  wait  (and  the  economy  will  move  along  a  spiral)  or  we  can  increase  expenditures  to  increase 
aggregate  demand  (and  in  this  way  we  move  more  rapidly  towards  the  equilibrium.)  You  can  do  this 
graphically as an exercise. 

6.  What Moves the Curves? 

So far, we have seen what makes the economy move, but we always assumed in all these movements that 
the  equilibrium  is  static  (that  the  curves  do  not move). This  is  not  always  the  case.  In  fact,  the  curves  do 
change.  For  example,  let’s  suppose  that  we  are  in  a  situation  of  equilibrium  (point  “E”)  and  suddenly 
there is an epidemic and 50% of the workers die. The initial situation can not be an equilibrium any more. 
The labor market will be overheated, as there are many jobs available and few workers that can take them. 

Another  example  is  what  happens  if  we  are  in  equilibrium  and  there  is  a  positive  shock  in  an  important 
export  sector  (for  instance,  if  we  are  net  exporters  of  oil,  a  positive  shock  would  be  a  sudden  positive 
jump  in  oil  prices).  Clearly  the  old  situation  is  not  an  equilibrium  anymore.  Let’s  see  these  examples  in 
more detail. 

6.1.  Changes in the Labor Force: Migrations 

Let’s suppose  that we are  in a situation of equilibrium and suddenly  there  is a migration  into our country. 
Before, we were at full employment, but now we have a situation of unemployment. Notice that when the 
migration  occurs,  there  are  no  immediate  changes  in  wages,  real  exchange  rate,  or  aggregate  demand. 
This  means  (for  now)  that  the  economy  has  not  moved.  However,  we  are  now  in  a  situation  of 
unemployment  with  external  equilibrium.  This  means  that  the  NN  curve  must  have  shifted  upwards.  In 
other  words,  for  the  same  aggregate  demand  and  the  same  real  exchange  rate,  we  have  unemployment 
with external equilibrium, whereas before we had equilibrium in both markets. 

NN

e /w

BB

E´

D

 

To  return  to  equilibrium  we  must  have  an  increase  in  aggregate  demand  and  a  depreciation  of  the  real 
exchange  rate  (a  reduction  of  the  real  wage  “w/e”).  Notice  that  this  is  exactly  what  occurs  in  those 
countries  that  have  a  very  high  population  growth.  In  these  countries  the  real  wages  are  low  and 
nevertheless they are falling. 

6.2.  Changes in Labor Regulations 

Similarly, if we change the labor regulations and it is now cheaper to lay off workers, then companies will 
be willing to increase employment keeping wages the same. This is a situation of overheating. 

Notice  that  the  conclusion  depends  crucially  on  our  assumption  about  the  impact  of  the  reform.  In  this 
case  we  are  assuming  that  the  reform  increases  the  demand  for  labor.  However,  there  are  other  types  of 
reforms that could very well reduce the demand for labor (e.g. restructuring of the public sector). 

6.3.  Positive Oil Shocks 

If  oil  is  one  of  the  main  exports  of  our  country  and  the  oil  price  goes  up,  then  we  have  a  situation  of 
surplus  with  full  employment.  This  means  that  the  BB  curve  has  shifted  down.  In  other  words,  the  new 
equilibrium  results  in  an  appreciation  of  the  real  exchange  rate.  This  is  what  is  known  as  the  Dutch 
disease. Dutch disease occurs when an exporting sector experiences big productivity increases, causing an 
appreciation of the real exchange rate that damages other exporting sectors.

6.4.  Productivity Increases 

D

 

Analogously  to  the  previous  point,  if  we  are  in  equilibrium  and  productivity  increases  in  the  exporting 
sector,  then  the  economy will  experience  a  surplus  in  the  balance  of  payments  so  that  the BB  curve will 
shift down. Notice that in this case we also obtain an appreciation of the real exchange rate. 

7.  Sustainable and Unsustainable Appreciations 

We  have  defined  the  real  exchange  rate  “appreciated”  when  the  economy  is  located  below  its  external 
equilibrium.  Is  this  good or  bad?  In principle,  the workers  are  receiving  a  dollar wage  that  is  higher  than 
what  they  would  receive  in  equilibrium.  On  the  other  hand,  this  situation  is  unsustainable  and  either 
unemployment  or  external  accounts  deficit will  force  a  real  depreciation.  In  other words,  an  appreciation 
of the real exchange rate, when not sustainable, makes little sense. 

Now,  let’s  suppose  that  we  observe  an  appreciation  of  the  real  dollar  wages.  Is  this  a  sustainable  or  an 
unsustainable appreciation? As economists say, it depends! 

If  the  appreciation  is  caused  by  shifts  in  the  BB  or  the  NN  curves,  it  is  due  to  a  movement  of  the 
equilibrium point and  is  therefore  sustainable. On  the other hand,  if  the appreciation  is occurring because 
there  is  internal  inflation  (and  wages  go  up)  but  zero  devaluation  of  the  currency,  then  this  real 
appreciation is unsustainable. 

Moreover,  if  the  appreciation  is  occurring  because we  are  expecting  that  the BB will move  in  the  future, 
then  it  might  be  sustainable  in  the  short  run.  It  is  important  to  remember  that  it  has  to  be  sustainable  at 
some  point  in  time. We  can  run  a  deficit  if  we  are  expecting  good  news  to  come,  but  we  can  not  run  a 
deficit forever. 

8.  Social Peace Curve 

As we have  seen,  the  real exchange  rate  is associated with  the  inverse of  the  real wage. The  idea  is  that a 
lower  real  wage  makes  an  economy  more  competitive  abroad  (and  this  is  good  in  some  social  circles.) 
However,  greater  competitiveness  implies  a  lower  dollar  wage  and  therefore  a  lower  standard  of  living 
(and  this  does  not  sound  so  good  in  other  social  circles.)  Let’s  define  the  social  peace  curve  “P”  as  the 
minimum standard of living below which we experience social problems. 

e/w

Social Problems

Social Peace

If  the  real  exchange  rate  is  very  depreciated  (dollar  wages  are  very  low,)  then  the  economy  will  have 
social problems.  If, on  the other hand,  the exchange  rate  is very appreciated  (dollar wages are high,)  then 
we have social peace. We can put the three curves together.

Nothing  forces  these  curves  to  cross  in  the  same  point.  Therefore,  we  have  three  intersections:  one  in 
which  there  is  equilibrium  in  the  balance  of  payments  and  in  the  labor  market,  but  there  are  social 
problems  (IMF.) Another  one  in which  there  is  social  peace  and  equilibrium  in  the  balance  of  payments, 
but  we  have  unemployment  problems  (Europe.)  And  finally,  one  in  which  there  is  full  employment  and 
social  peace,  but  we  have  a  deficit  in  the  balance  of  payments  (Populism.)  The  question  is,  which  one 
shall we choose?

There  is  no  simple  answer.  Moreover,  none  of  these  equilibria  is  sustainable  in  the  long  run.  What 
happens  in  reality  is  that  economies  cycle  among  these  equilibria.  They  start  with  populism:  people  are 
happy  but  the  deficit  forces  the  government  to  implement  an  adjustment  program.  This  adjustment 
program  fixes  the  disequilibria,  but  wages  in  dollars  are  so  low  that  social  problems  start  to  appear. 
Pressures  from  some  sectors  force  the  government  to  allow  an  appreciation  of  the  exchange  rate,  but  as 
the  external  equilibrium  must  be  kept,  expenditures  are  cut.  The  exchange  rate  starts  to  appreciate  and 
demand  falls. These  two  effects guarantee  to  a  certain  extent  the  equilibrium  in  the balance  of payments, 
but the employment situation deteriorates. The year before the elections, the government decides that it is 
necessary  to  expand  the  economy.  Expansionary  fiscal  and  monetary  measures  are  used  to  reduce  the 
unemployment  problem,  but  they  cause  disequilibrium  in  the  balance  of  payments.  So  we  move  back  to 
the populist equilibrium, where the government remains until it runs out of reserves. The new government 
comes and the cycle starts again. 

How can we  solve  the problem and exit  from  the cycle? Well,  there are no  solutions! The only  thing  that 
the  economy  can  do  is  to  take  time  and  try  to  move  the  IMF  equilibrium  down.  The  other  option  is  to 
move the social peace curve up, as shown in the graph below. Let’s see each alternative separately.

We  can  generate  a  productivity  increase  that  guarantees  that  the  labor market  and  the  external  equilibria 
occur  in  the  region  of  social  peace.  In  this  case,  we  have  an  equilibrium  that  is  obviously  preferable. 
Clearly, we  need  a  sufficiently  big  increase  in  productivity. Another  alternative  is  to move  the NN  curve 
downwards.  This  can  be  obtained with migrations. We  could make  the  social  situation  of  the  country  so 
bad  that  it  would  cause  emigration.  This  is  obviously  not  the  best  solution,  because  generally  the  best 
human resources are the first to leave. But, from a theoretical point of view, this would shift the NN curve 
down, moving the equilibrium into the social peace area. 

On  the  other  hand, we  can maintain  the  economy with  a  certain  level  of  dissatisfaction  in  order  to  get  it 
accustomed  to  a  reduction  in  the  standard  of  living.  Obviously,  this  takes  years,  so  these  adjustment 
processes  are painful  to  the  economy.  In  this  case,  the  social peace  curve will  slowly  shift up,  eventually 
allowing a sustainable equilibrium.

It  is  critical  to  understand  that  the  problem  can  not  be  solved  with  any  macroeconomic  cosmetics.  For 
example,  if  we  move  to  a  flexible  exchange  rate,  the  sustainability  of  the  equilibrium  does  not  change. 
The  real  exchange  rate  is  a  relative  price  and  therefore  does  not  depend  on  the  nominal  regime  (for 
instance,  the  real  equilibrium  exchange  rate would  be  the  same  under  a  fixed  or  a  flexible  exchange  rate 
system). Monetary, fiscal, or exchange rate policies will have no impact on the real equilibrium exchange 
rate. Only  structural measures  can modify  the  situation.  In  other words,  the  IMF  equilibrium  is  desirable 
from the point of view of economic equilibria, however it is not sustainable from the social point of view, 
regardless  of  the  economic  policy.  When  society  is  not  ready  to  sustain  the  IMF  equilibrium,  only  by 
making  structural  changes  (moving  the  BB,  NN  and  P  curves)  can  we  reach  a  permanently  sustainable 
real exchange rate. 

In  summary,  when  we  include  the  social  aspects  in  our  model,  we  find  an  indeterminacy  of  the 
equilibrium,  which  makes  the  analysis  of  adjustment  programs  quite  interesting.  In  this  case,  we  are 
talking about social peace, but many other considerations could be  included. Keep  in mind  that  the world 
is a complex place and  simple  solutions are not always available. The  inclusion of  the  social peace  curve 

in  this  model  gives  a  quite  interesting  slant  to  the  discussion  and  the  explanation  of  historical  events. 
Moreover,  it allows us  to  rationalize past decisions without having  to blame  ignorance or  stupidity.   This 
is fundamental for the study of economic history.

(1960)  and Swan  (1961) when  they proposed  the  original model. Later Dornbusch  (1980)  formalized  the 
model  calling  it  the  dependent  economy.  Unfortunately,  one  of  the  problems  of  this model  is  that  easily
