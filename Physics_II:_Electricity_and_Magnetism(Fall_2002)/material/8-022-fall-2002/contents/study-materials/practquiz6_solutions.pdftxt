Solutions for Practice Quiz #6 


The emf source E is connected as shown in the figure below in a network 
that involves resistors R_1 , R_2 and R_L 

Let us first introduce the arrows for I1,I2,I3,emf and the "positive" 
direction in summing potentials. Notice that with the exception of the emf, 
all other directions are completely arbitrary. Flipping the "positive" 
direction in summing potentials on a loop simply changes the sign of both 
hand sides of an equation. For what concerns I1,I2 and I3 though, if we 
end up with negative values, that means that our initial guess of the 
direction was wrong and instead the opposite one is the correct. 

There are 3 loops that are formed of which 2 equations are independent. 
There is also a junction equation (charge conservation). There are three 
unknowns (I1/I2/I3) and we need three (independent) equations in order to 
determine them. Pick any 2 loop equations and the junction equation, 
follow Kirchhoff's laws and you are done. 

Notice that there are 3 correct answers to this problem. Which are the 
other 2? 

In calculating R_eff, proceed in steps identifying that you have the right 
most R_1 in series with R_L. Their sum is in parallel with R_2. This sum is 
in series with the left most R_1. 

Equate the above R_eff with R_L to find out that: 

In order to find out V_CD, you should identify that 
I1=emf/R_eff=emf/R_L (remember, R_eff=R_L) and I3=V_CD/R_L. You 
then have:
