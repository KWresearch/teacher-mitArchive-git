Introduction and Review 

Coulomb's Law, Superposition, Electric Fields  


Reading Handout #1, Purcell Chapter 1.  


Problem Set #1

Work on all problems. Not all problems receive equal points. Total points for this set is 100.  


z  (10 points) [1] A force 

is acting on a particle which is initially at the 

origin of the 

plane. We transport the particle on a square path defined by the points (0,0), 

(1,0),(1,1),(0,1) in the counterclockwise direction. A is a positive constant. 
{  What are the units of A? 
{  How much work does the force do when the partilce travels around the path? 
{  Suppose that the particle is released at (1,1) and that only the force given is acting on it. The 
particle is not constrained to move along the square path considered initially. Give a 
qualitative description of its motion. Will it ever reach the origin? (assume that no other 
forces act on the particle). 

z  (10 points) [2] Find the force from the following potentials: (a) 

, 

and (c) 

. 

z	 (10 points) [3] Purcell Problem 1.1 (p.34): Relative strength of Electrostatic and Gravitational 
forces. 

z  (15 points) [4] Purcell Problem 1.3 (p.34): Two charged volley balls. 

z  (10 points) [5] Purcell Problem 1.4 (p.34): Charges on corners of a square. 

z  (10 points) [6] Purcell Problem 1.5 (p.34): A charged semicircle. 

z 

(10 points) [7] Purcell Problem 1.11 (p.35): Electric field by two point charges. 
Optional:
Plot the value of E(x) along the x axis (i.e., where E(x)=E(x)  ). 

z	 (10 points) [8] Purcell Problem 1.24 (p.37): Electric field from continuous charge distribution 
(finite rod). 

z	 (15 points) [9] Purcell Problem 1.26 (p.37): Electric field from continuous charge distribution 
(hairpin).
