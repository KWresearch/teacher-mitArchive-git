Problem Set #4

Work on all problems. Not all problems receive equal points. Total points for this set is 100.  


z  (20 points) [1] Energy of a conductor in a capacitor. 

Two flat square metal plates with sides of length L are arranged parallel to each other with a 
separation of S where S<<L. This assumption allows you to neglect the fringing effects due to the 
finite size of the plates. A charge +Q is moved from the top plate to the bottom. A third, 
uncharged, conducting plate of the 
same size with thickness 
is slid between the other two to a 

depth of x, maintaining the same spacing of 

between its surface and that of the other two. 

{  What are the surface charge densities 
and narrow gaps? 
{  What is the electric field in the wide and narrow gaps? 
{  What is the capacitance of the system? 

and 

on the lower plate adjacent to the wide 

{  How much energy is stored in the electric field?  

{  What force must be exerted on the middle plate to keep it from moving?  


z  (15 points) [2] Purcell Problem 3.6 (p.114): Line charge near a conducting plane. 

z  (15 points) [3] Purcell Problem 3.9 (p.115): Point charges and conducting plane. 

z	 (20 points) [4] Image on a sphere. 
Find the image (location and magnitude) of a point charge of strength +Q located at distance l 
from the center outside of a grounded conducting sphere. Assume the radius of the sphere is a 
(clearly, a<l). Prove that the potential on the sphere due to the charge +Q and its image is indeed 
zero. 

z  (15 points) [5] Purcell Problem 3.23 (p.117): Cylindrical capacitor. 

z  (15 points) [6] Capacitors in Series and in Parallel. 

{  Derive an expression for the equivalent capacitance of two capacitorsC1 and C2 connected 
in series and in parallel (express in terms of C1 and C2). 
{  Assume capacitors C1, C2, C3 and C4 are connected as shown in the figure. What is their 
equivalent capacitance when the switch S is open (as shown)? Find the charge on each of 
the capacitor plates when the switch is open and when it is closed. Express all your answers 
in terms of C1, C2, C3, C4 and V
