Problem Set #11

Work on all problems. Not all problems receive equal points. Total points for this set is 100.  


z	 (15 points) [1] Charge in series RLC. 
We have examined in details a series RLC circuit driven by a periodic Emf 

. 

We will now work on the expression and features of q(t), the charge on the capacitor in this 
circuit. 
{  Derive a differential equation showing the time evolution of the charge q on the capacitor 
(do not solve it!). 
{  Use the known solution for I(t) and the definition I(t)=dq/dt to find an expression for q(t). 
Show its form in complex number notation, phasor and physical charge (real number). 
{  Show that the charge amplitude 
is maximum for frequency 

. Show that for large quality factors Q, that frequency reduces to 

the natural frequency 

.
