z  (20 points) [1] Current Flow Between Cylindrical Plates. 

The space in between two cylindrical copper plates of radius a and b (b>a)i s filled with a material 
. The length of the plates is L. The two plates are kept at constant potential Va 
of conductivity 
and Vb (Va>Vb). Express all your answers in terms of Va,Vb,a,b and L. 
Find the resistance of this configuration.

in the space between the two cylinders. 
Find the current density 
{ 
{  Find the electric field 
in the space between the two cylinders. 
z  (20 points) [2] Snell's Law for Electric Currents. 

An infinite medium has two regions I and II each with conductivity 

and 

separated by a 

plane interface. In region I a uniform current density 

flows up to the interface at an angle 

. 

{  Find the magnitude and angle of the current density 

in region II. 

on the interface.
