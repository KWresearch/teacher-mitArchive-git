Assignment #3 

Div, Curl, Laplace's and Poisson's Equations  

Conductors, Capacitance  


Reading Purcell Chapter 2 and 3.  


Problem Set #3

Work on all problems. Not all problems receive equal points. Total points for this set is 100.  


z	 (10 points) [1] Useful identities: 

If u is a scalar function and V is a vector function, show that:  

(uV)=u  V+( 
u)V and (b) 
(uV)=u 
V+( 
(a) 

u)  V. 


z  (15 points) [2] Purcell Problem 3.3 (p.113): Charges near a conducting plane.  

z  (15 points) [3] Purcell Problem 3.4 (p.113): More charges near a conducting plane. 

z  (15 points) [4] Purcell Problem 3.5 (p.114): And even more charges near a conducting plane. 

z  (15 points) [5] Purcell Problem 3.10 (p.115): Spherical capacitor. 

z  (15 points) [6] Purcell Problem 3.16 (p.116): Electric force on a capacitor.  

z  (15 points) [7] Purcell Problem 3.17 (p.116): Design of a spherical capacitor.
