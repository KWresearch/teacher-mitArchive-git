Hints to Assignment #5 -- 8.022 

Please note: in problem #1, sigma, the conductivity of the material is 
involved in all the formulas and when the problem states "express all your 
answers in terms of V_a,V_b,a,b and L", sigma should be included too. 

[1] Current Flow Between Cylindrical Plates 

The two metal cylinders are equipotential surfaces at potentials fixed by the EmF. 

•	

•	

Imagine the space in between the cylindrical plates is broken into cylindrical 
shells of radial width dr and area 2*pi*r*L. Could that be your infinitesimal 
resistor? Are these resistors in series or in parallel? We did lay out the solution to 
this problem in class... 
In finding J recall Ohm's law in the microscopic description. Its integral over area 
is a constant which you do not know yet. You will need to find E from J and then 
use the boundary conditions for the potential on the plates in order to determine 
this constant. 

[2] Snell's Law for Electric Currents 

Assume that J1 and J2 are steady currents driven by corresponding electric fields E1 and 
E2. 

•	 Assume media are uniform and isotropic so that Ohm's law in the microscopic 
version applies (without invoking tensors etc...) 
•  You need to find J2, which is a vector, i.e., it needs a magnitude and direction. 
•	 Define a cartesian coordinate system: Choose the x^,y^ plane as the plane 
PERPENDICULAR to the interface onto which the J1 vector lives. 
•  Once you've identified x^,y^,z^, write J's and E's in terms of their projections. 
•	 Once at steady state, what "comes in" must "go out" in terms of the current 
through the interface... 
•	 One of the two E components must be conserved (why?) while the other E 
components' change must measure the surface density on the interface. 
•	 Watch out not to mess up the sigmas (conductivities) with sigmas (surface charge 
densities, use SIGMA, in capital if you wish). 

[3] Purcell's 4.21: Resistive Network 

•	

For part (a), first find the current flowing in the circuit. You do not need any of 
Thevenin's or Kirchhoff's laws for that, just plain Ohm. 
•	 Assume B is at V_b. Take a dq charge and move it from V_b to V_a. Plot its 
potential V versus point on the circuit (does it matter which way it goes? there are 
obviously two options ...). Specify on your answer if you've calculated V_b-V_a 
or V_a-V_b. These are of course opposite, BUT, not all authors agree as to what 
they refer to when they talk about potential DIFFERENCE on a circuit. When in 
doubt, ASK, or write down the V(1)-V(2) your answer refers to. 
For part (b), you probably want to use now Mr. Kirchhoff's laws. Identify the 
nodes and branches and write down a system of 3 eqns with 3 unknowns. 
•  For the last part, you will need some definitions at p.158, last two paragraphs.

[4] Purcell's 4.25: Discharging Capacitor 

•	 Well, you shouldn't definitely break your friendship with your friends who do not 
believe capacitors really discharge... Let the math convince them. Open up 
together your old PC, read your transformer's DC outputs, should be +-5V,+-12V 
(at least), a common voltage of operation for many integrated circuits and chips. 
Try to read some capacitor values (well, your PC must be _really_ old if you 
manage to do that). Anyways, it must be somewhere in the pF to nF range. 
Assume that say 12V charged one of this capacitor. Find its charge and express it 
in terms of number of electrons. 
•	 Assume now that the capacitor discharges, typically in your computer is over 
resistances of the order of x100-x1000 Ohms, but having a hard to convince 
friend, offer him to discharge it over a more resistive element, like your body, so 
that to make the escaping of the charge even harder (i.e., slower). Use the 
exponential law with the RC you now have and find the time to reach a charge of 
1e- on the capacitor. 

[5] Purcell's 4.32: Infinite Resistor Chain 

That could have been an algebra (sequences) problem or an example of (mathematical) 
induction! I know some of you are already calculating the Nth term of the sequence... It 
might help you if you change notation for R_1 and R_2 to R_a and R_b in order to avoid 
confusion with the 1st and 2nd elements of the sequence. 

•	 Your text gives the crucial hint, i.e., at n-->oo, R_(n+1)=R_n. This should be 
enough to solve the problem. OPtionally and for gaining confidence that the 
sequence indeed converges, you would like (NOT REQUIRED FOR YOUR 
HOMEWORK) to prove that the sequence CONVERGES. Use induction to show 
that R_(n+1).lt.R_n for all n (start with showing R_2.lt.R_1 and then assume that 
R_(n).lt.R_(n-1) is true in order to show R_(n+1).lt.R_n). 

•	 Assume just two steps in this ladder where the final R_b is replaced by your 
"load" R_L. Try requesting R_eff=R_L and you are ready to start your attenuator 
manufacturing company. (ps ".lt." is shortnotation for "less than" ... clearly do not 
know how to do it in html). 

[6] Purcell's 4.33: Kirchhoff's Law and Minimum Power Requirement 

Well, the way the problem is presented guides you through the solution. The only point 
you should make sure you understand is the power dissipation on a resistor R through 
which a current I flows. 

•	 We can see how this comes along in the macroscopic picture of conductivity, i.e., 
in the picture where a net current flows between potential differences obeying 
Ohm's law. In order to see this, assume a charge dq (positive, BY DEFINITION 
in circuitry language) goes through the resistor in time dt (so that the current 
I=dq/dt remains constant through the _length_ of the circuit (but not necessarily 
through time...)). Its potential drops from V_i to V_f for a total energy loss of 
(V_i-V_f)*dq We have already worked out (starting from the effect of the applied 
potential difference, i.e., electric field) on the charge carriers (assumed positive 
here) that V_i-V_f=I*R Thus the energy lost _on_ the resistor within dt will be 
dE=I*R*dq If we divide by dt we find the dissipated power P=dE/dt=I*R*I or 
I^2*R. This power is expended on thermal motion and thus heat of the material 
the current goes through. 
In the microscopic picture, i.e., individual charge carriers moving under the 
influence of electric fields (external) we will hopefully find the same answer. As 
we have seen in the microscopic description of conductivity, the effect of E on the 
q's is described by an average drift velocity v. The power then of the applied force 
on one such carrier will be dW/dt=Fv=qEv and for N such carriers then 
dW/dt=NqEv= nALqEv where n is the number density of the carriers, A is the 
cross-section and L is the length of the conductor. You may identify deltaV=EL 
and I=JA=nqvA reducing the above formula to dW/dt=V*I=I^2*R. 
•  Find I1,I2 by solving potential equations. 
•	 Write down P in terms of one of the two (unknown) currents and use your 
familiar conditions for an extreme (but also minimum) of a function.
