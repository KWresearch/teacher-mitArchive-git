Hints to Assignment #7 -- 8.022 

[1] Transforming velocities 

This is a direct application of the transformation of velocities from a moving frame to the 
lab frame. Express the velocity in terms of its components and apply the formulas we 
derived in class. If there are any doubts remaining, lecture notes could be of help. 

[2] Speed of Light 

Show that after N carts u_N.lt.c as seen by the lab observer and that this is true for any 
value of N. Express u_(N+1) in terms of u_N, it helps. 

[3] Lorentz invariants 

Use the expressions transforming the 4-position (i.e., t,x,y,z) and 4-momentum 
(E,p_x,p_y,p_z) from a moving frame to the lab one. Substitute in the expression for Phi. 

[4] High energy protons 

THese are the bread and butter calculations of high energy physicists! Here are a few 
items to keep in mind: 

•	 The Tevatron brings the protons to a kinetic energy of 1TeV. If relativity wasn't 
there, classical theory would had predicted a velocity beta=sqrt(2x1000/1)=45! 
•	 As we derived in class, Kinetic Energy T=relativistic energy - rest energy.But 
relativistic energy E=gamma X rest mass energy. We now the rest mass of the 
proton and its kinetic energy, thus gamma should be pretty straighforward. 
•	 Check out Fermilab's web page and given link- it's fun! The energy given in that 
page is for proton before entering the Tevatron. 

[5] Relativistic collisions 

•	

Introduce your two preferred symbols for the mass and velocity of the compound 
system that do not overlap with symbols already used in the problem description. 
•	 Express the initial/final momenta/energies. Conservation can lead you to two 
equations. 

[6] Relativistic capacitor 

The key element here is that the electric charge is a Lorentz invariant, i.e., the same for 
all inertial observers. All such observers applying Gauss's law on a closed surface that 
encloses ALL charges (by measuring the field and areas at the same time in their frame) 
will find the flux equal to 4*pi*Q. 

•	 The applied potential over the two plates fixes the electric field in between the 
plates (assume the battery is disconnected shortly after charge up). 
•	 There are four relevant equations: E=V/d, E=4*pi*sigma, sigma=Q/A, A = width 
x depth 
•  Pick your system of units, namely CGS. 1e-=4.8x10^-10esu. 
In the West-East motion the velocity is parallel to the plates, thus one of the 
•	
dimensions of the plates contracts- you have a new A,sigma, and thus E. 
In the upward motion the velocity is perpendicular to the plates, thus the 
dimensions of the plates are the same. Only the spacing between the two plates 
contracts. Does this matter for E? 
•  Ask yourself how a South-North motion would fit in any of the above two.
