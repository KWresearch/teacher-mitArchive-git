[1] RC circuit: qualitative analysis. 

The qualitative behaviour of an uncharged capacitor can be itemized as follows: 

•	

•	

at t=0 it presents zero resistance in the circuit, thus it can be replaced with a 
resistanceless wire. 
REDRAW THE CIRCUIT BY REPLACING THE CAPACITOR --||--
WITH A PLAIN WIRE ----
at t-->oo it presents infinite resistance in the circuit, i.e., no current can flow 
through it and the potential it presents on its leads counterbalances whatever 
potential charges it. 
REDRAW THE CIRCUIT BY REMOVING THE BRANCH THAT 
CONTAINS THE CAPACITOR. 

As you can appreciate, this does not mean that at t-->oo there is no current flowing in a 
circuit that involves a capacitor; it depends on the circuit and how the capacitor is 
connected. For example, in the circuit under consideration in this problem, while I_R3 
goes to zero at t-->oo, I_R1 and I_R2 remain finite and non-zero at t->oo. 

You are now ready to start filling out the following table where t=0 is assumed to be the 
instance the switch is closed: 

========================================================= 
|  t  | I_R1 | I_R2 | I_R3 | V_R1 | V_R2 | V_R3 | V_C  |
| ->O  |

========================================================= 

The qualitative behaviour of a charged capacitor when it is the only source of energy in a 
circuit can be itemized as follows (assuming t=0 is the instance we bring a charged 
capacitor in a circuit): 

•	

•	

at t->0, the capacitor acts like an Emf of initial strength equal to the potential it 
was charged on. 
at t-->oo the capacitor discharges (Q=0==>V_C=0) and all currents in the circuit 
seize to exist (assuming the capacitor was the only source of energy in the 
circuit). 

You are now ready to fill out a similar table like the one above. 

Here are a few more things you should keep in mind: 

•	 This is a linear circuit and all its state variables will be discribed by 
superposition of partial solutions. We know how a stand alone RC system 

behaves, thus all points we have defined in the above two tables will be connected 
with exponentials. DO NOT WORK OUT the exact time constant for each of 
them. Simply draw exponentials connecting start and end of phenomenon. 
•	 The transition from closed switch to open switch implies discontinuities in ALL 
BUT ONE of the seven variables we have been examining. In order to figure out 
which of the seven variables under discussion will be continuous, consider that 
CHARGE ON THE CAPACITOR is continuous and thus from the definition of 
capacitance, also ... is continuous. Convince yourself that the other 6 variables 
"jump" when we open the switch. 
In setting up a system of equations for a detailed derivation of the quantities 
involved, we will assume the classical circuitry problem where EMF,R1,R2,R3 
and C are given and we are asked to find I1,I2 and I3. Write down Kirchhoff's 
rules #1 and #2 for these three quantities. Chose for I3 the direction that charges 
up the +Q plate of the capacitor AND KEEP THIS PROTOCOL THE SAME 
even for the discharge. If you end up with an EXTRA variable (maybe the Q on 
the capacitor?), recall how it is connected with I ...

[2] RC circuit: qualitative analysis. 

•	 When the capacitor does not make part of the circuit (open switch), the current is 
rather straighforward to calculate. Notice that this is the same current flowing 
through all the elements (=V/(3R)). 
•	 You should be able to set up a system of three equations with three unknowns 
(I1,I2,I3) or equivalently a system of four equations (the forth one being 
I_c=dQ_c/dt) with four unknowns (I1,I2,I3 and Q_c). Clearly, you have to reduce 
them to a single one (differential) for Q_c. You should solve this equation for 
Q_c. Make some remarks on t->0 and t->oo behaviour. Does it agree with our 
qualitative expectations discussed before? 
•	 You should find that after t->oo, the charge on the capacitor is Q_oo = 4CV/3 and 
thus you have the energy stored ready: Q^2/(2C). 
•	 When we replace the two batteries with resistanceless wires, the capacitors "sees" 
two resistors in parallel: one of 2R and another one of R, thus of total resistance 
2R/3. Can you see why?? If yes, then your answer in the final part is obvious. 
•	 OPTIONAL: This is a typical example where the Thevenin theorem can simplify 
our lives a lot. Find the Thevenin equivalent of what is presented on the leads of 
the capacitor. this should be a resistor of 2R/3 and an EMF of 4V/3. Can you see 
this? If yes, you an rework the same problem by considering just three elements 
in series: an EMF of 4V/3, a resistor of 2R/3 and a capacitor C. We have worked 
out the solution for this configuration in class. 

[3] Invariance of intervals. 

Assume the moving frame has a velocity v=vi^, i.e., along the x axis. Use Lorentz 
transformations and write down how event "1" coordinates are translated from the lab 
frame to the moving frame. Do the same for event "2" and derive how deltaT=t2-t1, 
deltaX=x2-x1, etc transform under this scheme. COnstruct delta S' and substitute the 
primed delta variables from the above equations. 

[4] Lorentz transformations. 

Fairly straighforward problem involving Lorent transformations. You will have to find 
gamma and from gamma you can readily find beta=v/c. 

[5] Low velocity Lorentz transformations. 

Our strategy for solving this problem is identified in the spelling of the problem, i.e., 
Taylor expansion. Recall how gamma=1/sqrt(1-beta^2) is approximated for small enough 
beta's. Keep first order in u/c terms only. 

[6] Transforming angles. 

This problem has a lot of insight to offer us as it touches upon our laws of physics 
(Gauss' Law) as seen by two observers. 

•	

•  Assume the stick is in the X-Y plane and forms an angle phi with respect to X. 
Identify the X and Y projections of the stick in one of the frmaes, say the moving 
•	
one. 
•	 You should convince yourself that the Y projection is the same for both observers 
while the X projection is contracted (see Prof. Fisher handout and the Appendix 
of our textbook) thus X=X'/gamma 
Form the ratios Y/X and Y'/X' and find how they are related. This gives the 
transformation of the tangents of the angles phi and phi' between the two 
observers. 
•	 Assume an observer is riding on a charge moving with velocity v with respect to 
the laboratory. For her, the field of lines are UNIFORM AND ISOTROPIC. If 
they are represented with sticks emanating from the charges, they will not be seen 
exactly this way by the laboratory observer. Use the result from the previous step 
and draw some representative sticks.
