Reading Purcell Chapter 1 and 2.  


Problem Set #2

Work on all problems. Not all problems receive equal points. Total points for this set is 100. Notice that 

some problems have OPTIONAL questions. THESE ARE NOT REQUIRED, it is only for your 

entertainment.  


z  (10 points) [1] Electric Field from Potential. 
Derive the electric field described by the following potential that is written in cylindrical 
. What are the units of K in SI and 
coordinates: 

CGS? Express the electric field in cylindrical, cartesian and polar coordinates. 

z	 (15 points) [2] Soda Centaurus. 
An extraterrestrial spaceship from Mondus Lontanus lands at MIT's campus and chief scientist 
Aurelius Studiolanum hands to 8.022 students a print out depicting a structure known to his people 
as Soda Centaurus that they hit upon their voyage to Earth. 

Soda Centaurus, Aurelius says, is a very simple structure: imagine two thin-walled, infinitely long, 
concentric cylinders (soda cans) of radii a and b each carrying equal and opposite charges of 
uniformily distributed around the cans. 
constant line density 

Using an electric probe of an infinitesimally small charge aboard their spacecraft, Aurelius 
measured the electric field magnitude E on the five points shown on the plot above (A,B,C,D,E). 

{  On the basis of the magnitude of E, rank the five points from the smallest to the largest. 
{	 Draw a Gaussian surface of your choice for each of the following cases that encloses the 
geometric point C (no electric charge resides on C) and has (I) positive net electric flux, (II) 
zero net electric flux, (III) negative net electric flux. 

{  During their trip within Soda Centaurus, Aurelius- contrary to his commander's 
instructions- had secretly carried into his pocket an electron e -. What is the work done (if 
any?) on e - by the electric field (if any?) in Soda Centaurus as the spacecraft traveled from 
the outer cylinder (radius a) to the inner one (radius b)? Do we need to know the spaceship's 
trajectory in order to calculate the work? 

z  (10 points) [3] Purcell Problem 1.30 (p.36): Energy of concentric charged balls. 

z  (10 points) [4] Purcell Problem 1.8 (p.35): Potential energy of a 1-dim crystal. 

z	 (15 points) [5] Purcell Problem 1.16 (p.36): A hollow sphere. 
Optional: Find the electric field E anywhere inside the cavity. Will this change if instead we had 
carved out a sphere of radius a/4 centered in the same location (a/2)? 

z  (10 points) [6] Purcell Problem 2.8 (p.80): Charged Cylinder. 

z	 (15 points) [7] Purcell Problem 2.10 (p.80): Potential from continuous charge distribution (finite 
rod). 
Optional: Imagine a variation in this problem where the z=0 is not at the center of the rod but in 
one of its ends. Find V for a point P'1 on the z and P'2 on the x axis. Can you determine E (watch 
out, vector!) at P'1 and P'2 just from V you have just (re)calculated? How about finding V at these 
where k is a constant? 
points if the rod was NOT uniformly charged but, say, 

z	 (15 points) [8] Electric Dipole. 
Two equal and opposite charges q are fixed at the ends of a rigid rod of length d. This is called an 
electric dipole. The dipole moment p is defined by p= qd where d is the vector from the negative 
to the positive charge. The dipole is placed in a uniform electric field E. Show that there is a total 
p
E and that the energy of the dipole is U = -pE.
