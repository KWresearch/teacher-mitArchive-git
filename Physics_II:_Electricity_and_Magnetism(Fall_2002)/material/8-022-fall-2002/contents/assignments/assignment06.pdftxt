z  (20 points) [1] RC circuit: qualitative analysis. 

Three resistors (R1,R2 and R3), a capacitor C and an Emf E are connected as shown in the figure 
below. Let us denote VR1
=Va -Vb, VR2
=Vb -Vd, VR3
=Vb -Ve and VC =Ve -Vd. The capacitor is 
assumed uncharged at t=0 when we ``close'' the switch S.

after 
infinite time has elapsed since the switch S was opened. Extend the previous plot in order to 
show the behaviour of these 7 quantities after the switch S is open.

. Using Kirchhoff's rules, write down the 
system of equations that can yield these functions before and after the switch S was opened. 
Identify the number of unknowns and the number of variables in each case. Do not solve 
the system of equations. 

z  (20 points) [2] Another RC circuit. 

Three resistors (each of R), a capacitor C and two batteries each of V and 2V are connected as 
shown in the figure below. The switch S is initially open and a steady-state current is flowing 
through the circuit. 
{  Find the current flowing through the circuit. 
{	 Now, suppose that the switch S is closed at t=0 and that the capacitor is originally 
uncharged. Find the charge and voltage on the capacitor as a function of time. Find the 
energy stored in it when it is fully charged (after infinite time). 
{	 Now, suppose that we wait until the capacitor is completely charged and at that point we 
replace the two batteries with two resistanceless wires and we reset our clocks to zero. Find 
the charge on the capacitor as a function of time. Compute the total energy dissipated in the 
resistors and compare it to the energy stored in the capacitor when it was completely 
charged (you have calculated this in the previous item). 

z	 (15 points) [3] Invariance of intervals. 
A quantity that is left unchanged by the Lorentz transformations is called a Lorentz invariant. 
Consider two events described in the laboratory frame with event coordinates x1,y1,z1,t1 and 
x2,y2,z2,t2. Show that 
is a Lorentz 
where 

invariant. Here 

is the time interval between the two events and 
is the spatial distance between them in the same inertial system. 

z	 (15 points) [4] Lorentz transformations. 
Two events occur at the same place in the laboratory and are separated in time by 3 seconds. What 
is the spatial distance between these two events in a moving frame with respect to which the 
events are separated in time by 5 seconds? What is the relative speed of the moving and laboratory 
frames? 

z 

(15 points) [5] Low velocity Lorentz transformations. 
Show that for small enough 
the Lorentz transformations reduce to the Galilean 

transformations. Use Taylor expansions for 
to show this and compute the next term in the 
expansion to find v such that this term contributes 10% to the x transformation. For what value of  

v does the value of 
differ from unity by 1%? 


z	 (15 points) [6] Transforming angles.

The meter stick makes an angle 

same meter stick make with the x axis of the lab frame? Assume now that the directions of electric 

field lines around a point charge transform in the same way as the directions of meter sticks that 

lie along these lines. Draw qualitatively the electric field lines due to an isolated positive point 

charge at rest in the ``moving frame'' as seen in (a) the ``moving frame'' and (b) the ``lab frame''. 

What can you say about the force acting on a test charge q at distance D perpendicular to 
as  

measured by an observer in each of the frames? Will it be the same of different?
