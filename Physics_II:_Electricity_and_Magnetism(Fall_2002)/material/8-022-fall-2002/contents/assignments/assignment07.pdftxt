Problem Set #7

Work on all problems. Not all problems receive equal points. Total points for this set is 100.  


z  (15 points) [1] Transforming velocities. 

in the x'y' plane of a moving frame S' and at an angle  with 
A bullet is fired with velocity 
respect to x'. Frame S' moves with velocity v with respect to the laboratory frame S along the x 
axis. Find the angle the velocity vector of the bullet makes with the x axis of the laboratory frame. 
What if the bullet is a photon (light)? 

z  (20 points) [2] ``Traveling circus beats the speed of light!'' 

A circus company advertises its arrival in Cambridge, Massachusetts with big headlines in local 
newspapers describing the first show ever that is plausible to beat the speed of light. The 
spectacle is described as follows. First, they set up a long enough train that travels at velocity v 
(v<c) with respect to the audience. Then, a number of small carts are added one on top of each 
other and on top of the train. Each cart moves at velocity v with respect to previous one and in the 
same direction with the previous one, i.e., the first cart rolls in the same direction with the train 
and with velocity v relative to the train; the second cart rolls on the first cart in the same direction 
with it and with a velocity v with respect to it and so on and so forth. 

The company claims to put as many carts as it takes so that the speed (as seen by the circus 
audience) of the final cart on top of this pyramid to exceed the speed of light and calls all 
Cambridge citizens to come witness this unique moment. 

Will they be able to ever succeed their claim? Explain. 

Hint: use induction and you should have your answer in less than 1 line. 

Optional: Find the speed of the nth cart. Notice that 

tends to 0 when 

. 

Find the maximum attainable speed the Circus company can ever succeed reaching. 

z  (20 points) [3] Lorentz invariants (part-II). 

We have already seen scalar quantities that are invariant under Lorentz transformations: s2=(ct)2-
2-y2-z2 or 
x
, for example. These are the ``squares'' (taken 
in the underlying Minkowski metric: diag{1,-1,-1,-1} of special relativity) of the 4-vectors 
corresponding to position and momentum. Another celebrated scalar is the product of the 4-
momentum and 4-position 
(where 
are the ordinary 3-vector momentum and 

position) which we will identify in the last 2 weeks of our course as proportional to the phase of a 
plane wave of a propagation vector 
and angular frequency 
. 

Show that 

as defined above is a Lorentz invariant. 

z  (15 points) [4] High energy protons. 

A proton in Fermilab's Tevatron accelerator is accelerated to about 1TeV. In all the following, 
approximate proton's rest mass energy to 1GeV. 
{  What is the 
and 
factor of the proton? 
{  What is its total energy? 

{  What is its momentum?  

{  What is its relativistic mass?  

{  Optional: Check out in real time the status of Fermilab's Tevatron accelarator by visiting:

z  (15 points) [5] Relativistic collisions. 

A particle of rest mass m1 and velocity v1 collides with a stationary particle of rest mass m2 and is 
absorbed by it. What is the velocity and the rest mass of the final compound system? 

z  (15 points) [6] Purcell Problem 5.1 (p.200): Relativistic capacitor.
