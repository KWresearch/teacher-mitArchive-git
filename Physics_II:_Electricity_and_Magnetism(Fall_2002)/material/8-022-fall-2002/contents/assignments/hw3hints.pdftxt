Hints to Assignment #3 -- 8.022 

(10 points) [1] Useful identities 

•	 Assume u is a scalar function of space, i.e., u(x,y,z) and V is a vector function of 
space, i.e., V(x,y,z)=v1(x,y,z) i^ + v2(x,y,z) j^ + v3(x,y,z) k^ where v1,v2,v3 are 
scalar functions. 
•  Express the divergence and curl in cartesian coordinates. 
•	 Do a bit of regrouping of terms (recall the definition of gradient) and you are 
done. 

(15 points) [2] Charges near a conducting plane (Purcell 3.3) 

This is the first of a series of problems for which you will have to digest section 3.4 from 
Purcell (p.97-103). 

•	 Call R the distance where a horizontal field line lands on the plane. That is of 
course a circle on the plane that is being defined. 
•  What is the surface charge density sigma on the plane? (did you read section 3.4?) 
If only you knew what is the total charge q induced on the plane and contained 
•	
within R then you could calculate the integral of sigma over that circular disk and 
equate it to q thus finding an equation for R. 
•	 Remember Mr. Gauss: flux is proportial to q (and vice versa). What is the total 
flux 'hitting' the disk of radius R if measured in units of number of field of lines? 

(15 points) [3] More charges near a conducting plane (Purcell 3.4) 

•  Set up a coordinate system. 
•	 Both the given Q and -Q are in front of a mirror, if you know what I mean. Does 
this tell you anything about their images? 
•	 Write down the force balance equation. How many solutions did you come up 
with? 

(15 points) [4] And even more charges near a conducting plane (Purcell 
3.5) 

•	 Q^2/2h would be the work spent by the external agent to move *both* charges Q 
and -Q (imagine, symmetrically). But is the second charge 'real' or just an 'image'? 

•	 The charge Q at distance x can not tell the difference between the presence of the 
plane or the presence of the -Q at position -x (behind the mirror, distance 2x from 
Q). Find then what is the force Q feels at any distance x and integrate. 

(15 points) [5] Spherical capacitor (Purcell 3.10) 

•  Find E in all space. 
If you know E you can find the potential. 
• 
•  Use the definition of capacitance (from Q,phi) and you are done. 
•	 The formal limiting behavior might require some Taylor expansion but you can 
probably get to right answer by some back of the envelope approximations. 

(15 points) [6] Electric Force on a capacitor (Purcell 3.16) 

•	

First of all, you have to appreciate that the plates of the capacitor are held in 
equilib by some mechanical forces which act against the electrical ones! 
•	 We have proven in class that the (electric) force per unit area dF/da=u=dU/dv is 
the energy density of the electric field. 
•	 You know the potential, thus you know the electric field, thus you know u. The 
integration is straighforward (?). 
•	 Now, answers to the following questions will help you guide through the rest of 
the problem: 
o 
if q remains the same, does E change as the plates come closer? 
o  how does the force you've just calculated change? 
o	 what is the energy stored in the capacitor initially and finally (plates 
collapsed)? 
o  do you have any reason to believe conservation of energy is violated? 

(15 points) [7] Design of a spherical capacitor (Purcell 3.17) 

This can be a real life problem if you work in the capacitor industry... But you are well 
prepared as you've solved by now problem 3.10. 

•	 Armed with the math from 3.10 assume b=(lambda) x a and express the energy 
stored in the capacitor in terms of lambda, a and E_o 
•  Find the extrema of the energy function in terms of lambda (a, E_o are fixed).
