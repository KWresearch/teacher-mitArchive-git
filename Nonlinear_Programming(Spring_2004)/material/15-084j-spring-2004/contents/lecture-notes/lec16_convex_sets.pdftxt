1  Convex  Sets  - Basics 
A set  S  ⊂  IRn  is  deﬁned  to  be  a  convex  set  if  for  any  x1  ∈  S ,  x2  ∈  S , 
and  any  scalar  λ  satisfying  0  ≤  λ  ≤  1,  λx1  + (1 − λ)x2  ∈  S .  Points  of  the 
form  λx1  + (1 − λ)x2  are  said  to  be  a  convex  combination  of  x1  and  x2 , if 
0 ≤ λ ≤ 1. 
A  hyperplane  H  ∈  IRn  is  a  set  of  the  form  {x ∈ R |  p x = α}  for  some 
n
t
ﬁxed  p ∈ IRn ,  p  (cid:5)= 0,  and  α ∈ R. 
A  closed  halfspace  is  a  set  of  the  form  H +  =  {x  |  ptx  ≥  α}  or  H
−  = 
{x  |  ptx  ≤  α}.  An  open  halfspace  is  deﬁned  analogously,  with  ≥  and  ≤ 
replaced  by  <  and  >. 
•	 Any  hyperplane  or  closed  or  open  halfspace  is  a  convex  set 
•	 The  ball  {x ∈ IRn  |  x1  + . . . + x2  ≤ 5}  is  a  convex  set.

•	 The  intersection of an arbitrary number of convex  sets  is a  convex  set. 
•	 A  polyhedron  {x ∈ IRn  |  Ax ≤ b}  is  a  convex  set. 
•	 X  = {x  |  x = αx1 + βx2 ,  where  x1  ∈ S1  and  x2  ∈ S2}  is  a  convex  set, 
if  S1  and  S2  are  convex  sets. 
Let S  ⊂ IRn .  The  convex hull of S , denoted H (S ),  is  the  collection of all 
convex  combinations  of  points  of  S ,  i.e.,  x  ∈  H (S ) if  x  can  be  represented 
(cid:1) 
as

λj  = 1, λj  ≥ 0, j  = 1, . . . , k , 
j=1 
for some positive integer  k  and  vectors  x1 , . . . , xk  ∈ S . 
Lemma   1   If  S  ⊂  IRn ,  then  H (S )  is  the  smal lest  convex  set  containing  S , 
and  H (S )  is  the  intersection  of  al l  convex  sets  containing  S .

The  convex  hull  of  a  ﬁnite  number  of  points  x1 , . . . , xk+1  ∈ IRn  is  called 
a  polytope. 
If the vectors x2−x1 , x3−x1 , . . . , xk+1−x1 , are linearly independent, then 
H (x , . . . , xk+1 ) is called a k-dimensional simplex, with vertices x , . . . , x

eodory   Theorem.   Let  S  ⊂ IRn , and  let  x ∈ H (S )  be  given.  Then 
Carath´
x ∈ H (x1 , . . . , xn+1 ) for n + 1 suitably chosen points xj  ∈ S , j  = 1, . . . , n + 1. 
In  other  words,  x  can  be  represented  as

Proof:   Since  x ∈ H (S )  ,  there  exist  k  points  x1 , . . . , xk  that  satisfy

If  k ≤ n + 1, we  are  done.  If  not,  let  us  consider  the  above  linear  system 
as  a system of  n + 1  equations  in  the  nonnegative  variable  λ ≥  0,  i.e.,  as  a 
system  Aλ = b, λ ≥ 0,  where

Let  e = (1, . . . , 1)t . 

Notice  that  this  system  has  n + 1  equations  in  k  nonnegative  variables. 
From  the  theory  of  linear  programming,  this  system  has  a  basic  feasible

solution,  and  we  can  presume,  without  loss  of  generality,  that  the  basis 
consists  of  columns  1, . . . , n + 1  of  A.  Thus,  there  exists  λ  ≥  0,  etλ  = 1,

2  Closure  and  Interior  of  Convex  Sets 
Let  x  ∈  IRn  . Deﬁne  N (x) =  {y  ∈  IRn  | (cid:7)y − x(cid:7)  < },  where  (cid:7) · (cid:7)  is  the 
(cid:4) (cid:5)  n (cid:5)(cid:1) 
Euclidean  norm: 
(cid:7)z(cid:7) := (cid:6) 
√ 
z 2  =  z tz .
j 
j=1 
Let S be an arbitrary set in Rn .  x ∈ clS , the closure  of S , if S ∩N (x)  (cid:5)= ∅ 
for  every   > 0.  If  S  = clS ,  then  S  is  a  closed  set.  x ∈ intS ,  the  interior  of 
S ,  if  there  exists   > 0  for  which  N (x) ⊂ S . If  S  = intS ,  then  S  is  an  open 
set.  x ∈ ∂S ,  the  boundary  of  S , if  N (x)  contains  a  point  in  S  and  a  point 
not  in  S ,  for  all   > 0. 
Theorem  2   Let  S  be  a  convex  set  in  Rn . If  x1  ∈ clS  and  x2  ∈ intS ,  then 
λx1  + (1 − λ)x2  ∈ intS  for  every  λ ∈ (0, 1). 
Proof:   Since  x2  ∈ intS ,  there  exists   >  0  such  that  (cid:7)z − x2(cid:7) <   implies 
z  ∈ S .  Also,  since x1  ∈ clS ,  for any δ > 0,  there exists a z  with (cid:7)z − x1(cid:7) < δ 
and  z  ∈  S . Now  let  y  =  λx1  + (1 − λ)x2  be  given,  with  λ  ∈  (0, 1).  Let 
r  = (1 − λ).  I  claim  that  for  any  z  with  (cid:7)z − y(cid:7)  < r ,  then  z  ∈  S .  This 
means  that  y ∈ intS ,  proving  the  theorem. 
To  prove  the  claim,  consider  such  a  z  with  (cid:7)z  − y(cid:7)  < r . Let  δ  = 
(1 − λ) − (cid:7)z − y(cid:7).  Then  δ >  0.  Then  there  exists  z 1  with  (cid:7)z 1  − x1(cid:7)  < δ 
and  z 1  ∈ S . Let  z 2  = (z − λz 1 )/(1 − λ).

Thus  z 2  ∈ S . Also  z = λz 1  + (1 − λ)z 2 , and  so  z  ∈ S .

3  Supporting  Hyperplanes  of  Convex  Sets 
Let  S  be  nonempty  set  in  Rn , and  let  x  ∈  ∂S .  A  hyperplane  H  =  {x  ∈ 
¯
IRn  |  ptx  =  α}  (where  p  (cid:5)
= 0)  is  call  a  supporting  hyperplane  of  S  at  x  if

for  all  x ∈ S , and  p x = α. 
t ¯
x},  i.e., H  = {x  | pt (x − ¯
Note  that we can write H  as H  = {x  | p x = pt ¯	
t
x) =
0}. If  S  (cid:5)⊂ H ,  then H  is  called  a  proper  supporting  hyperplane. 
Note  that  either  p x = inf {p x  | x ∈ S } or  pt ¯x = sup{ptx  | x ∈ S }.

Theorem  3  If  S  is  a  nonempty  convex  set  and  x  ∈ ∂S ,  then  there  exists 
¯
a  supporting  hyperplane  to  S  at  x;  that  is,  there  exists  a  nonzero  vector  p
¯
such  that  p x ≤ pt ¯
x  for  al l  x ∈ S .

Proof:   Let  ¯x ∈ ∂S .  Then  there  exists a  sequence of  y i , i = 1, . . . , ∞,  such 
x, and  y ∈ cl(S ).  Now  cl(S )  is  a  closed  convex  set,  and  so  there 
that  y → ¯
i 
i  /
exists  p (cid:5)i  =  0  and  αi  such  that  (pi )T x ≤ αi  for  all  x  ∈ cl(S ),  and  (pi )T y > 
i
αi .  We  can  re-scale  the  p values  so  that  (cid:7)pi(cid:7)  = 1.  As  y →  ¯
i
i 
x,  choose 
subsequence  of  the  pi  that  converge,  say,  to  ¯p.  Then  (pi )T x ≤ αi  <  (pi )T y
i
for  all  x  ∈ cl(S ),  and  so  p¯T x  ≤ p¯T ¯x. Thus,  as  i  → ∞, any  x  ∈ S  ⊂ cl(S ) 
pT x ≤ p¯T ¯
satisﬁes  ¯
x. 

Theorem  4  If  A  and  B  are  nonempty  convex  sets  and  A ∩ B  = ∅,  then  A 
and B  can  be  separated  by  a  hyperplane.  That  is,  there  exists  p  (cid:5)= 0,  α,  such 
that  pT x ≤ α  for  any  x ∈ A  and  pT x ≥ α  for  any  x ∈ B . 

Let  S  =  {x  |  x  =  x1  − x , x1  ∈  A,  x2  ∈  B}.  Then  S  is  a 
Proof:  
2
convex  set,  and  0  /∈ S . Let  T  = cl(S ) =  S ∪ (∂S ).  If  0  ∈ T ,  then  0  ∈ ∂S , 
and  from  Theorem  3,  there  exists  p  (cid:5)=  0,  such  that  pT (x1  − x2 )  ≤  0 for 
any  x1  ∈ A,  x2  ∈ B ,  so  that  p x
T  1  ≤ pT  2
x for  any  x1  ∈ A,  x2  ∈ B . Let 
α = inf {pT x2  | x2  ∈ B}.  Then  pT x1  ≤ α ≤ pT x2  for  any  x1  ∈ A,  x2  ∈ B . 
If 0  /∈ T ,  then since T  is a closed set,  then we can apply  the basic separating 
hyperplane  theorem  for  convex  sets:  there  exists  p  (cid:5)=  0  and	 β  for  which 
pT (x1  − x2 )  ≤ β <  pT 0  =  0  for  any  x1  ∈ A,  x2  ∈ B ,  so  that  p
T x1  ≤ pT  2
x
for  any  x1  ∈ A,  x2  ∈ B .  Again  let  α  = inf {pT x2  | x2  ∈ B}.  Then  p
T x1  ≤
α ≤ pT x2  for  any  x1  ∈ A,  x2  ∈ B .

Corollary  5   If  S1  and  S2  are  nonempty  disjoint  closed  convex  sets,  and  S1 
is  bounded,  then  S1  and  S2  can  be  strongly  separated. 

4  Polyhedral  Convex  Sets 
S  is  a  polyhedral  set  if  S  =  {x  ∈  IRn  |  Ax  ≤  b}  for  some  (A,  b).  x  is  an

x  can  be  represented  as  ¯

d ∈ IRn  is  called a  ray  of S  if whenever x ∈ X , x + αd ∈ S  for all α ≥ 0.  d  is 
called  an  extreme  ray  of  S  if  whenever  d = λ1d1  + λ2d2  for  rays  d1 ,  d2  of  S 
and  λ1 , λ2  (cid:5)= 0,  then  d1  = αd2  for  some  α ≥ 0 or  d2  = αd1  for  some  α ≥ 0. 
Theorem  6   The  set  S  =  {x  ∈  IRn  |  Ax  =  b,  x  ≥  0}  contains  an  extreme 
point  if  S  (cid:5)= ∅. 

Theorem  7  Let  S  = {x ∈ IRn  |  Ax ≤ b}  be  nonempty.  Then  S  has  a  ﬁnite 
number  of  extreme  points  and  extreme  rays. 

Theorem  8  Let  S  =  {x  ∈  IRn  |  Ax  ≤  b}  be  nonempty.  Then  there  ex-

5  Convex  Functions  - Basics 
Let  S  ⊂  IRn  be  a  nonempty  convex  set.  A  function  f (·) :  S  →  IR  ∪ 
{−∞, +∞}  is  a  convex  function  on  S  if: 
f (λx + (1 − λ)y) ≤ λf (x) + (1 − λ)f (y)  for  all  λ ∈ [0, 1]  and  x, y ∈ S. 
f (·) is  strictly  convex  if  the  inequality  above  is  strict  for  all  λ  ∈  (0, 1)  and 
x  (cid:5)= y . 
f (·) is  concave  if  −f (·)  is  convex. 
f (·) is  strictly  concave  if  −f (·)  is  strictly  convex. 
Examples:  

1.  f (x) = ax + b 
2.  f (x) = |x| 
3.	 f (x) = x2  − 2x + 3

4.  f (x) =  x  for  x ≥ 0 
− 2x1x2 
2

5.  f (x1 , x2 ) = 2x1  + x2 
We  deﬁne  Sα  :=  {x  ∈  S  |  f (x)  ≤  α}.  Sα  is  called  the  level  set  of  f (·) at 
level  α. 

Lemma   9   If  f (·)  is  convex  on  S ,  then  Sα  is  a  convex  set. 
Proof:   Let  x, y  ∈  Sα .  Then  f (x)  ≤  α  and  f (y)  ≤  α, and  so  λ  ∈  [0, 1] 
implies 
f (λx + (1 − λ)y) ≤ λf (x) + (1 − λ)f (y) ≤ λα + (1 − λ)α = α , 
and  so  λx + (1 − λ)y ∈ Sα .  Therefore  Sα  is  a  convex  set. 
Note,  the  converse  Lemma  9  is  false.

Theorem  10   If  S  ⊂ IRn  is  an  open  convex  set  and  f (·)  is  a  real-valued 
convex  function  on  S ,  then  f (·)  is  continuous  on  S . 

Proof:   We  will  prove  this  in  three  steps. 
(cid:9) 
Step  1.  If  f (·)  is  convex  on  S  and  x , . . . , xk  ∈ S  and  λ1 , . . . , λk  ≥ 0 and

f ⎝

Step  2.  For  each  x  ∈ S ,  there  exists  a  β >  0  such  that  x ± β ei  ∈ S , for 
i  = 1, . . . , n,  where  ei  is  the  ith  unit  vector.  Call  these  vectors  z1 , . . . , z2n . 
Let Mx  := max{f (z1 ), . . . , f (z2n )}. 
Since  x  lies  in  the  interior  of  the  convex  hull  of  z1 , . . . , z2n ,  there  exists 
tx  >  0  such  that  B (x, tx ) :=  {y  | (cid:7)y  − x(cid:7) ≤t x} also  lies  in  the  convex 
(cid:9)2n 
(cid:9)2n 
hull  of  z1 , . . . , z2n .  Then  for  any  y  satisfying  (cid:7)y  − x(cid:7) ≤t x  it  holds  that 
j=1 λj zj  for  some  appropriate  λ1 , . . . , λ2n  ≥ 0 and 
⎞ 
⎛
y  =

(cid:1)

so 
f (y) = f ⎝

λj f (zj ) ≤ Mx  .

Step  3.  (The  proof  of  the  theorem).  Without  loss  of  generality,  we  assume 
that  f (0)  =  0  and  we  want  to  prove  f (x)  is  continuous  at  x  =  0.  For  any 
 > 0, we must  exhibit a  δ > 0  such  that  if (cid:7)y(cid:7) < δ  then − ≤ f (y) ≤ . Let 
t >  0 and  M  be  chosen  so  that  (cid:7)y(cid:7) ≤ t  implies  f (y)  ≤ M  (from  Step  2). 
Now  let  δ  =  t/M . Let  y  satisfy  (cid:7)y(cid:7) < δ .  Also,  we  can  assume  that M >  

6  Subgradients  of  Convex  Functions 
Let  S  ⊂  IRn , and  f (·) :  S  →  IR  be  given.  The  epigraph  of  f (·),  denoted 
epi  f (·),  is  a  subset  of  IRn+1  and  is  deﬁned  to  be: 
epi  f (·) := {(x, α) ∈ IRn+1  |  x ∈ S,  α ∈ IR, f (x) ≤ α}  . 
The  hypograph  of  f (·),  denoted  hyp  f (·),  is  deﬁned  analogously  as 
hyp  f {(x, α) ∈ IRn+1  |  x ∈ S,  α ∈ IR, f (x) ≥ α}  . 
Theorem  11  Let  S  be  a  nonempty  convex  set  in  IRn , and  f (·) :  S  →  IR. 
Then  f (·)  is  a  convex  function  if  and  only  if  epi  f (·)  is  a  convex  set. 
Proof:   Assume  f (·)  is  convex.  Let  (x1 , α1 ),  (x2 , α2 )  ∈  epi  f (·).  Then  if 
λ  ∈  (0, 1),  λx1  + (1 − λ)x2  ∈  S ,  because  x1  ∈  S ,  x2  ∈  S , and  S  is  convex. 
Also α1  ≥ f (x1 ), α2  ≥ f (x2 ),  f (λx1 + (1 − λ)x2 ) ≤ λf (x1 ) + (1 − λ)f (x2 ) ≤ 
λα1 + (1 − λ)α2 . Thus  (λx1 + (1 − λ)x2 ),  (λα1 + (1 − λ)α2 ) ∈ epi  f (·),  and 
so  epi  f (·)  is  a  convex  set. 
Conversely,  assume  that  epi  f (·)  is  a  convex  set.  Let x1 , x2  ∈ S , and  let 
α1  = f (x1 ), α2  = f (x2 ).  Then  (x1 , α1 ) ∈ epi  f (·) and  (x2 , α2 ) ∈ epi  f (·). 
Thus  (λx1  + (1 − λ)x2 ,  λα1  + (1 − λ)α2 ) ∈ epi  f (·). 
This means f (λx1 + (1− λ)x2 ) ≤ λα1 + (1− λ)α2  = λf (x1 )+ (1− λ)f (x2 ), 
and  so  f (·)  is  a  convex  function. 
If  f (·) :  S  →  IR  is  a  convex  function,  then  ξ  ∈  IRn  is  a  subgradient  of 
f (·) at  ¯x ∈ S  if 

x)  for  all  x ∈ S .
x) + ξ t (x − ¯
f (x) ≥ f ( ¯

Example :  f (x) =  x2  and  let  ¯ = 3  and  ξ  =  6.  Notice  that  from  the  basic 
x
inequality 
0 ≤ (x − 3)2  = x 2  − 6x + 9 

we  obtain  for  any  x: 
f (x) = x 2  ≥ 6x − 9 = 9 + 6(x − 3) = f ( ¯
x) + 6(x − ¯
x)  ,

12 

which  shows  that  ξ = 6  is  a  subgradient  of  f (·) at  x = ¯x = 3. 
Example :  f (x) = |x|.  Then  it  is  straightforward  to  show  that: 
•  If  ¯
x > 0,  then  ξ = 1  is  a  subgradient  of  f (·) at  ¯
x
x < 0,  then  ξ = −1  is  a  subgradient  of  f (·) at  ¯
•  If  ¯
x
x = 0,  then  ξ  ∈ [−1, 1]  is  a  subgradient  of  f (·) at  ¯
•  If  ¯
x. 

Theorem  12   Let  S  ⊂  IRn  be  a  convex  set  and  f (·) :  S  →  IR  be  a  convex 
function.  If  x  ∈  intS ,  then  there  exists  a  vector  ξ  ∈  IRn  such  that  the 
¯
hyperplane  H  = {(x, y) ∈ IRn+1  |  y = f ( ¯
x) + ξ t (x − ¯

x)}  supports  epi  f (·)  at
x)).  In  particular,  f (x) ≥  f ( ¯
x)  for  al l  x ∈  S , and  so  ξ  is 
x) + ξ t (x −  ¯

x, f ( ¯
( ¯
a  subgradient  of  f (·)  at  ¯x. 

Proof:   Because epi f (·) is a convex set, and ( ¯
x)) belongs to the bound-
x, f ( ¯
ary  of  epi  f (·),  there  exists  a  supporting  hyperplane  to  epi  f (·) at ( ¯
x)).
x, f ( ¯
Thus  there  exists  a  nonzero  vector  (ξ , u) ∈ IRn+1  such  that 
x + uα ≤ ξ t ¯
x)  for  all  (x, α) ∈ epi  f (·)  . 
ξ t 
x + uf ( ¯

Let  α  be  any  scalar  larger  that  f (x).  Then  as  we  make  α  arbitrarily  large, 
the  inequality must  still  hold.  Thus  u ≤ 0.  If  u < 0,  we  can  re-scale  so  that 
u = −1.  Then  ξ tx − α ≤ ξ t ¯
x − f ( ¯
x),  which  upon  rearranging  yields: 
x)  for  all  (x, α) ∈ epi  f (·)  .
x) + ξ t (x − ¯
α ≥ f ( ¯
x) + ξ t (x − ¯
In  particular,  with  y = f (x),  f (x) ≥ f ( ¯
x),  proving  the  theorem. 
It remains to show that u = 0 is an impossibility.  If u = 0, then ξ tx ≤ ξ t ¯x 
x + θξ  ∈  S  for  θ >  0  and  suﬃciently 
for  all  x  ∈  S .  But  since  x  ∈  int  S , ¯

¯
x + θξ ) ≤  ξ t ¯
x, and  so  θξ t ξ  ≤  0.  But  this  is  a  contradiction 

small.  Thus  ξ t ( ¯
unless  ξ = 0,  which  cannot  be  true  since  (ξ , u)  (cid:5)= (0, 0). 
The  collection  of  subgradients  of  f (x) at  x = ¯

x  is  denoted  by  ∂ f ( ¯
is  called  the  subdiﬀerential  of  f (·).  We  write  ξ  ∈ ∂ f ( ¯x) if  ξ  is  a  subgradient 
of  f (x) at  x = ¯x.

Theorem  13   Let  S  ⊂  IRn  be  a  convex  set,  and  let  f (·) :  S  →  IR  be  a 
function  deﬁned  on  S .  Suppose  that  for  each  x  ∈  intS  there  exists  a  sub-
¯
gradient  vector  ξ .  That  is,  for  each  ¯x  ∈  S  there  exists  a  vector  ξ  such  that 
f (x)  ≥  f ( ¯
x)  for  al l  x  ∈  S .  Then  f (·)  is  a  convex  function  on 
x) + ξ t (x −  ¯
intS . 

Theorem  14   Let  f (·)  be  convex  on  IRn , let  S  be  a  convex  set  and  consider 
the  problem: 

P:  minx 
f (x) 
s.t.  x ∈ S . 

Then  ¯x ∈ S  is  an  optimal  solution  of  P  if  and  only  if  f (·)  has  a  subgradient 
x) ≥ 0  for  al l  x ∈ S .
x  such  that  ξ t (x − ¯
ξ  at  ¯

x)  ≥  0 for 
x  for  which  ξ t (x −  ¯
Proof:   Suppose  f (·)  has  a  subgradient  ξ  at  ¯
all  x ∈ S .  Then  f (x) ≥ f ( ¯
x) + ξ t (x − ¯
x)  for  all  x ∈ S .  Hence  ¯
x) ≥ f ( ¯
x  is  an 
optimal  solution  of  P . 

Conversely,  suppose  ¯x  is  an  optimal  solution  of  P .  Deﬁne  the  following 
sets: 
A = {(d, α) ∈ IRn+1  |  f ( ¯
x)}
x + d) < α + f ( ¯

and 

B = {(d, α) ∈ IRn+1  |  x + d ∈ S,  α ≤ 0}  . 
¯
Both A  and B  are  convex  sets.  Also A ∩ B = ∅.  (If  not,  there  is  a  d  and  an 
x) ≤ f ( ¯ x + d ∈ S , so  ¯
x + d) < α + f ( ¯
x),  ¯
x  is  not  an  optimal 
α  such  that  f ( ¯
solution.) 
Therefore  A  and  B  can  be  separated  by  a  hyperplane  H  =  {(d, α)  ∈ 
IRn+1  |  ξ td + uα = β }  where  (ξ , u)  (cid:5)= 0,  such  that: 

x) ⇒ ξ td + uα ≤ β
•  f ( ¯
x + d) < α + f ( ¯
•  x + d ∈ S,  α ≤ 0 ⇒ ξ td + uα ≥ β
¯

14 

In  the  ﬁrst  implication  α  can  be  made  arbitrarily  large,  so  this  means 
u  ≤  0.  Also  in  the  ﬁrst  implication  setting  d  =  0  and  α  =   >  0  implies 
that β  ≥ u.  In  the  second  implication  setting d = 0  and α = 0  implies  that 
β  ≤  0.  Thus  β  =  0  and  u  ≤  0.  In  the  second  implication  setting  α  = 0 
we  have  ξ td  ≥  0  whenever  x + d  ∈  S , and  so  ξ t ( ¯
x + d −  ¯
x)  ≥  0  whenever 
¯
x + d ∈ S .  Put  another  way,  we  have  x ∈ S  implies  that  ξ t (x − ¯
x) ≥ 0. 
¯
It  only  remains  to  show  that  ξ  is  subgradient.  Note  that  u <  0,  for  if 
u  =  0  it  would  follow  from  the  ﬁrst  implication  that  ξ td  ≤  0  for  any  d, a 
contradiction.  Since  u < 0,  we  can  re-scale  so  that  u = −1. 
x + d) ∈ S  and  let  α = f ( ¯
x + d) − f ( ¯
Now  let  d  be  given  so  that  ( ¯
x) + 
for  some   >  0.  Then  f ( ¯
x),  and  it  follows  from  the  ﬁrst 
x + d)  < α + f ( ¯
implication  that  ξ td − f ( ¯
x) −  ≤ 0  for all   > 0.  Thus  f ( ¯
x + d) ≥ 
x + d) + f ( ¯
x + d ∈ S .  Setting  x = ¯
x + d,  we  have  that  if  x ∈ S ,
x) + ξ td  for  all  ¯
f ( ¯
x) + ξ t (x − ¯
f (x) ≥ f ( ¯
x),
and  so  ξ  is  a  subgradient  of  f (·) at  ¯x.

Lemma   7.1   Let  f (·) :  S  →  IR  be  convex.  If  f (·)  is  diﬀerentiable  at  x  ∈

{∇f ( ¯

Proof:   The  set  of  subgradients  of  f (·) at  x  is  nonempty  by  Theorem  12.

Let  ξ  be  a  subgradient  of  f (·) at  ¯x.  Then  for  any  d  and  any  λ > 0 we have:

epif (·) := {(x, α)  |  f (x) ≤ α}  . 
We deﬁne  f (·)  to be  a  convex  function  if  epif (·)  is  a  convex  set.  Show 
that  if  f (·) : IRn  →  IR,  then  this  deﬁnition  of  a  convex  function  is

9.  In  class,  we  stated  the meta  result  that  the  study  of  convex  functions 
reduces to the study of convex functions on the real  line.  This exercise 
formalizes  this  observation  and  shows  how  we  might  use  it  to  obtain 
results  about  convex  function  from  results  about  convex  functions  on 
the  real  line. 
(a)   Let f (x) be a real-valued function deﬁned on an open set X  ∈ IRn . 
Show  that  f (x)  is  a  convex  function  if  and  only  if  for  any  two 
points  x, y  ∈  X ,  the  function  g(θ) :=  f (θx + (1 −  θ)y) of the 
scalar  θ  is  convex  on  the  open  interval  θ ∈ (0, 1).

(b)  Suppose  that we  have  proved  that  a  twice  diﬀerentiable  function 
g(θ)  of  the  scalar  θ  is  convex  on  the  open  interval  θ  ∈  (0, 1)  if 
and  only  if  its  second  derivative  is  nonnegative  for  every  point  in 
this  interval.  Use  this  fact,  part  (a),  and  the  chain  rule  to  show 
that a twice diﬀerentiable real-valued function f (x) deﬁned on an 
open  set  X  ∈  IRn  is  convex  if  and  only  if  its  Hessian  matrix  is 
positive  semi-deﬁnite  at  every  point  in X .

let  S (a, b) :=  f (b)−f (a)  be  the  secant  slope  of  f (x)  between  the 
b−a 
points  a  and  b.  Prove  the  following  result: 
Three   Cord   Lemma:   f (x)  is  a  convex  function  on  an  the  in-
terval  I  = (l, u)  of  the  real  line  if  and  only  if  for  any  three  points 
a < b < c  in  I  we  have  S (a, b) ≤ S (a, c) ≤ S (b, c). 
(b)  Use the Three Cord Lemma and the mean value theorem to show 
that  a  twice  diﬀerentiable  function  f (x)  of  the  scalar  x  is  convex 
on  the  open  interval  I  = (l, u)  of  the  real  line  if  and  only  if  its 
second  derivative  is  nonnegative  for  every  point  in  this  interval.
