11.  Consider  the  problem: 
∗
P :  z  = minimumx1 ,x2 ,x3 

x1 

s.t. 

x2  +x3  = 0 
≤  10 

−x1 
(cid:13)(x1 , x2 )(cid:13) ≤x 3 
, 
where (cid:13) · (cid:13) denotes the Euclidean norm.  Then note that this problem is

feasible (set x1  = x2  = x3  = 0), and that the ﬁrst and third constraints

∗  = 0.

combine  to  force  x1  = 0  in  any  feasible,  solution,  whereby  z 
We  will  dualize  on  the  the  ﬁrst  two  constraints,  setting 
X  := {(x1 , x2 , x3 )  | (cid:13)(x1 , x2 )(cid:13) ≤ x3} . 
Using  multipliers  u1 , u2  for  the  ﬁrst  two  constraints,  our  Lagrangian

is:

L(x1 , x2 , x3 , u1 , u2 ) = x1+u1 (x2+x3 )+u2 (−x1−10) = −10u2+(1−u2 , u1 , u1 )T (x1 , x2 , x3 ) .

Then


∗
L  (u1 , u2 ) =  min 
(cid:3)(x1 ,x2 )(cid:3)≤x3 

−10u2  + (1 − u2 , u1 , u1 )T (x1 , x2 , x3 )  . 

(i)  Show  that: 

⎧
⎨
⎪  −10u2 
∗
L  (u1 , u2 ) = ⎪ ⎩  −∞ 

if 

if 

(cid:13)(1 − u2 , u1 )(cid:13) ≤u 1 
(cid:13)(1 − u2 , u1 )(cid:13) > u1  ,

s.t. 

and  hence  the  dual  problem  can  be  written  as: 
−10u2 
∗
D :  v  = maximumu1 ,u2 
(cid:13)(1 − u2 , u1 )(cid:13) ≤ u1 
u1  ∈ IR, u2  ≥ 0  . 
(ii)  Show  that  v  = −10,  and  that  the  set  of  optimal  solutions  of D  is 
∗
comprised  of  those  vectors  (u1 , u2 ) = (α, 1)  for  all  α ≥ 0.  Hence  both 
P  and  D  attain  their  optima  with  a  ﬁnite  duality  gap. 
(iii)  In  this  example  the  primal  problem  is  a  convex  problem.  Why 
is  there  nevertheless  a  duality  gap?  What  hypotheses  are  absent  that 
otherwise  would  guarantee  strong  duality?
