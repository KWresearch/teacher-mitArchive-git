Topic Introduction 
Today we investigate a new type of circuit – one which consists of both capacitors and 
inductors.  We will see that the resulting current in these circuits will oscillate, in a fashion 
completely analogous to the oscillation of a mass on a spring, and we will do a lab to 
measure the properties of this oscillation. 

Mass on a Spring:  Simple Harmonic Motion 
Consider a simple system consisting of a mass hanging on a spring.  When the mass is pulled 
down and released it oscillates up and down.  How do we understand this?  One way is to 
look at the forces on the mass.  When it is extended past its resting point the spring will want 
to pull it up.  If compressed the spring will want to push it down. 

This leads directly to a second way of thinking about it:  a differential equation for the 
k x  , where  x  means two time derivatives of the 
motion of the mass,  F  = m x =
 −
 
displacement, x (in other words, acceleration).  The solution to this differential equation is 
simple harmonic motion:  x = x0  c o s  (ωt )  where ω=  k m  . 

A third way of thinking about this is to consider the energy in the system.  As the mass 
moves, energy oscillates between kinetic energy of the mass and potential energy stored in 
the spring.  If there is no damping in the system (no friction) to dissipate the energy of the 
oscillation it will continue forever. 

LC Circuits 

Each of these ways of thinking can be applied to the circuit 
at left: an LC circuit.  Imagine that the switch is left in 
position a until the capacitor is fully charged and then the 
switch is thrown to position b.  This is analogous to pulling 
down a mass and then releasing it.  Why?  Remember our 
first way of thinking about the mass-spring combination above.  The mass wants to keep 
moving at a constant velocity, but the spring eventually gets extended or compressed as 
much as it can and manages to force the mass to come to a rest and move in the opposite 
direction.  Here the capacitor will want to discharge and hence will start to drive a current 
through the inductor.  Eventually all the charges will have run off of the capacitor, so it won’t 
“push” anymore, but now the inductor will want to keep the current flowing through it that it 
already has (this is what inductors do – they have inertia).  It will keep the current flowing, 
but that will eventually fill up the capacitor which will stop the current and send it back the 
other direction.  That is, the inductor is the mass (the current is the velocity of the mass) and 
the capacitor is the spring.  Instead of position we talk about charge on the capacitor q.  Our

We can also think about energy here, where it oscillates between being stored in the electric 
field in the capacitor and the magnetic field in the inductor.  As long as there is no dissipation 
(resistance) is the circuit the oscillations will continue forever. 

LRC Circuits 

If we add a resistor in series with the capacitor and 
inductor we will provide a method of energy loss in the 
system.  Whenever current flows some energy will be 
lost to heat in the resistor, and hence the oscillations 
will eventually damp out to zero.  The exact path the 
charge will take as it oscillates to zero depends on the 
relative sizes of L, R and C, but will typically look 
something like the curve to the left, where the 
oscillations are bounded by an “envelope” which is 
exponentially decaying to zero as a function of time.

Preparation:  Read lab write-up. 

This lab consists of two parts.  In the first you will measure the inductance of a solenoid by 
putting it in an LR circuit and measuring the time constant τ = L/R of the circuit.  In the 
second you will use that inductor in an LRC circuit and measure the frequency of the
