Topic Introduction 
In today's class we will define current, current density, and resistance and discuss how to 
analyze simple DC (constant current) circuits using Kirchhoff’s Circuit Rules.  

Current and Current Density 
Electric  currents  are  flows  of  electric  charge.  Suppose  a  collection  of  charges  is moving 
perpendicular to a surface of area A, as shown in the figure 

The electric current  I  is defined  to be  the  rate at which charges  flow across  the area A.  If

an amount of charge ∆  passes  through a  surface  in a  time  interval ∆ ,  then  the current 
G
is  given  by  I  ∆ Q 
J
  (amps  per 
  (coulombs  per  second,  or  amps).    The  current  density

  at  any  point  in  space  is  the  amount  of  charge  per  unit  time  per  unit  area

Electromotive Force 
A  source  of  electric  energy  is  referred  to  as  an  electromotive  force,  or  emf  (symbol ε). 
Batteries  are  an  example  of  an  emf  source.    They  can  be  thought  of  as  a  “charge  pump” 
that  moves  charges  from  lower  potential  to  the  higher  one,  opposite  the  direction  they 
would normally  flow.  In doing  this,  the emf creates electric energy, which  then  flows  to 
other parts of the circuit.  The emf ε is defined as the work done to move a unit charge in 
the direction of higher potential. The SI unit for ε is the volt (V), i.e. Joules/coulomb.   

Kirchhoff’s Circuit Rules 
In analyzing circuits, there are two fundamental (Kirchhoff’s) rules:  (1) The junction rule 
states  that  at  any  point  where  there  is  a  junction  between  various  current  carrying 
branches,  the  sum of  the currents  into  the node must equal  the sum of  the currents out of 
the  node  (otherwise  charge would  build  up  at  the  junction);  (2)  The  loop  rule  states  that 
the  sum  of  the  voltage  drops  ∆V   across  all  circuit  elements  that  form  a  closed  loop  is 
zero (this is the same as saying the electrostatic field is conservative).   

If you travel through a battery from the negative to the positive terminal, the voltage drop 
∆V   is  + ε,  because  you  are  moving  against  the  internal  electric  field  of  the  battery; 
otherwise  ∆V  is -ε.  If you travel through a resistor in the direction of the assumed flow 
of current, the voltage drop is –IR, because you are moving parallel to the electric field in 
the resistor; otherwise  ∆V  is +IR. 

Steps for Solving Multi-loop DC Circuits 
1)  Draw a circuit diagram, and label all the quantities;  

2)  Assign a direction to the current in each branch of the circuit--if the actual direction is  

opposite to what you have assumed, your result at the end will be a negative number;  
3)  Apply the junction rule to the junctions;  
4)  Apply the loop rule to the loops until the number of independent equations obtained is 
the same as the number of unknowns.
