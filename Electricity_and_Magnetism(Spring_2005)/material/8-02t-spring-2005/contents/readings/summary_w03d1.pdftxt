Topic Introduction 
Today we introduce two new concepts – conductors & capacitors.  Conductors are materials 
in which charge is free to move.  That is, they can conduct electrical current (the flow of 
charge).  Metals are conductors.  For many materials, such as glass, paper and most plastics 
this is not the case.  These materials are called insulators. 

For the rest of the class we will try to understand what happens when conductors are put in 
different configurations, when potentials are applied across them, and so forth.  Today we 
will describe their behavior in static electric fields. 

Conductors 
Since charges are free to move in a conductor, the electric field inside of an isolated 
conductor must be zero.  Why is that?  Assume that the field were not zero.  The field would 
apply forces to the charges in the conductor, which would then move.  As they move, they 
begin to set up a field in the opposite direction.  
An easy way to picture this is to think of a bar of 
metal in a uniform external electric field (from 
left to right in the picture below).  A net positive 
charge will then appear on the right of the bar, a 
net negative charge on the left.  This sets up a 
field opposing the original.  As long as a net field 
exists, the charges will continue to flow until they 
set up an equal and opposite field, leaving a net
zero field inside the conductor.

Capacitance 
Using conductors we can construct a very useful device which stores electric charge:  the 
capacitor.  Capacitors vary in shape and size, but the basic configuration is two conductors 
carrying equal but opposite charges (±Q).  In order to build up charge on the two plates, a 
potential difference ∆V must be applied between them.  The ability of the system to store 
charge is quantified in its capacitance:  C Q≡ 
∆V 
.  Thus a large capacitance capacitor can 
store a lot of charge with little “effort” – little potential difference between the two plates. 

A simple example of a capacitor is pictured at left – the 
parallel plate capacitor, consisting of two plates of area A, a 
distance d apart.  To find its capacitance we first arbitrarily 
place charges ±Q on the plates.  We calculate the electric field 
between the plates (using Gauss’s Law) and integrate to obtain 
the potential difference between them.  Finally we calculate

the capacitance:  C Q= 
∆V = ε0 A d .  Note that the capacitance depends only on 
geometrical factors, not on the amount of charge stored (which is why we were justified in 
starting with an arbitrary amount of charge). 

Energy 
In the process of storing charge, a capacitor also stores electric energy.  We can see this by 
considering how you “charge” a capacitor.  Imagine that you start with an uncharged 
capacitor.  Carry a small amount of positive charge from one plate to the other (leaving a net 
negative charge on the first plate).  Now a potential difference exists between the two plates, 
and it will take work to move over subsequent charges.  Reversing the process, we can 
release energy by giving the charges a method of flowing back where they came from (more 
on this in later classes).  So, in charging a capacitor we put energy into the system, which can 
later be retrieved.  Where is the energy stored?  In the process of charging the capacitor, we 
also create an electric field, and it is in this electric field that the energy is stored.  We assign 
to the electric field a “volume energy density” uE, which, when integrated over the volume of 
space where the electric field exists, tells us exactly how much energy is stored.

Experiment 2:  Electrostatic Force 
Preparation:  Read lab write-up.  Calculate (using Gauss’s Law) the electric field and 
potential between two infinite sheets of charge. 

In this lab we will measure the permittivity of free space ε0 by measuring how much voltage 
needs to be applied between two parallel plates in order to lift a piece of aluminum foil up off 
of the bottom plate.  How does this work?  You will do a problem set problem with more 
details, but the basic idea is that when you apply a voltage between the top and bottom plate 
(assume the top is at a higher potential than the bottom) you put a positive charge on the top 
plate and a negative charge on the bottom (it’s a capacitor).  The foil, since it is sitting on the 
bottom plate, will get a negative charge on it as well and then will feel a force lifting it up to 
the top plate.  When the force is large enough to overcome gravity the foil will float.  Thus 
by measuring the voltage required as a function of the weight of the foil, we can determine 
the strength of the electrostatic force and hence the value of the fundamental constant ε0.
