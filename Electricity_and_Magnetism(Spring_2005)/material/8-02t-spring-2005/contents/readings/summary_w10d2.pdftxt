Topic Introduction 
Today we continue thinking about Faraday’s Law, and move from mutual inductance, in 
which the changing flux from one circuit induces an EMF in another, to self inductance, in 
which the changing flux from a circuit induces an EMF in itself. 

Self Inductance 
Remember that we defined the mutual inductance between two circuits and gave the relation 
ε = −M  d I1  .  The self inductance obeys a similar equation: ε= − L 
d I
, and the same 
2 
d t  
d t  
concept:  when a circuit has a current in it, it creates a magnetic field, and hence a flux, 
through itself.  If that current changes, then the flux will change and hence an EMF will be 
induced in the circuit.  The action of that EMF will be to oppose the change in current (if the 
current is decreasing it will try to make it bigger, if increasing it will try to make it smaller).  
For this reason, we often refer to the induced EMF as the “back EMF.” 

To calculate the self inductance (or inductance, for short) of an object consisting of N turns 
of wire, imagine that a current I flows through it, and determine how much flux ΦB that 
makes through the object itself.  The self inductance is defined as  L N Φ B  I  .

An inductor is a circuit element whose main characteristic is its inductance, L. It is drawn as 
a coil 
 in circuit diagrams.  The strong resemblance to a solenoid is intentional – 
solenoids make very good inductors both because of their ability to make a strong field inside 
themselves, and also because the field they produce is fairly well contained, and hence 
doesn’t produce flux (and induce EMFs) in other, nearby circuits. 

The role of an inductor is to oppose changing currents.  At steady state, in a DC circuit, an 
inductor is off – it induces no EMF as long as the current through it is constant.  As soon as 
you try to change the current through an inductor though, it will fight back.  In this sense an 
inductor is the opposite of a capacitor.  If a capacitor is placed in a steady state current it will 
eventually fill up and “open” the circuit, whereas an inductor looks like a short in this case.  
On the other hand, when starting from its uncharged state, a capacitor looks like a short when 
you first try to move current through it, while an inductor looks like an open circuit, as it 
prevents the change (from no current to some current).

LR Circuits 
We can write down a differential equation for a simple circuit with an inductor, resistor and 
d I
battery in series using Kirchhoff’s loop rule, and using ε= − L 
for the potential drop that
d t  
would be measured if you were to walk across the inductor in the direction of current.  Just 
like RC circuits the solutions to this equation are exponential decays down to zero or up to 
some constant value.  Instead of RC, the time constant is now τ= L/R (a big inductance 
slows down the circuit as it is more effective at opposing changes, but now a big resistance 
reduces the size of the current, and hence changes in the current that the inductor will see, 
and hence decreases the time constant – speeds things up).  Just as with RC circuits, you can 
usually determine what is happening in the circuit just by thinking about what the elements 
do (e.g. inductors do what they can to keep the current steady – including sourcing current if 
they see the current decreasing). 

Energy in B Fields 
Where do inductors get the energy to source current when they need to?  In capacitors we 
found that energy was stored in the electric field between their plates.  In inductors, energy is 
similarly stored, only now its in the magnetic field.  Just as with capacitors, where the 
electric field was created by a charge on the capacitor, we now have a magnetic field created 
when there is a current through the inductor.  Thus, just as with the capacitor, we can discuss 
B 2 
1 L I
2  , and the more generic energy density  uB  = 
both the energy in the inductor, U  = 
 
2µ

stored in the magnetic field.  Again, although we introduce the magnetic field energy density 
when talking about energy in inductors, it is a generic concept – whenever a magnetic field is 
created it takes energy to do so, and that energy is stored in the field itself.
