Topic Introduction 
Today we continue our investigation of LRC circuits but add a new circuit element – the AC 
power supply.  This acts as a drive in the circuit and the current responds by moving at the 
drive frequency.  However, depending on the frequency of the drive, the current may be out 
of phase (either leading or lagging the drive) and its amplitude can also vary.  This is easily 
seen in mechanical systems.  For a fantastic example, go to the Kendall T station and play 
with the pendula – depending on how fast you drive them they will respond either in phase or 
out of phase with your drive, and they will either move a little or a lot.  This also 
demonstrates the notion of resonance.  When your drive frequency matches the natural 
frequency of the system, the amplitude increases greatly, and we say the system is “in 
resonance.” 
 
Mechanical Analogs 
xmax

Recall from last time that we have a relationship between 
inductance and mass (they both have inertia), between 
capacitance and spring constant (they both push when being 
“stretched” in either direction) and between resistance and 
dampers (they both dissipate energy when there is 
motion/current).  Our AC power supply is the equivalent of a 
force pushing on the mass in an oscillating fashion.  As 
mentioned above, when a mechanical system is driven at its 
natural frequency (the frequency it would oscillate at if not 
driven) then the system is in resonance, and the amplitude of the 
motion increases greatly.  At left is a typical plot of the amplitude of motion versus drive 
frequency.  Can you observe this at the Kendall T?  On a swingset? 
 
One Element at a Time 
In order to understand how this resonance happens in an RLC circuit, its easiest to build up 
an intuition of how each individual circuit element responds to oscillating currents.  A 
resistor obeys Ohm’s law:  V=IR.  It doesn’t care whether the current is constant or 
oscillating – the amplitude of voltage doesn’t depend on the frequency and neither does the 
phase (the response voltage is always in phase with the current). 
A capacitor is different.  Here if you drive current at a low frequency the capacitor will fill up 
and have a large voltage across it, whereas if you drive current a high frequency the capacitor 
will begin discharging before it has a chance to completely charge, and hence it won’t build 
up as large a voltage.  We see that the voltage is frequency dependent and that the current 
leads the voltage (with an uncharged capacitor you see the current flow and then the 
charge/potential on the capacitor build up). 
An inductor is similar to a capacitor but the opposite.  The voltage is still frequency 
dependent but the inductor will have a larger voltage when the frequency is high (it doesn’t

like change and high frequency means lots of change).  Now the current lags the voltage – if 
you try to drive a current through an inductor with no current in it, the inductor will 
immediately put up a fight (create an EMF) and then later allow current to flow. 
When we put these elements together we will see that at low frequencies the capacitor will 
“dominate” (it fills up limiting the current) whereas at high frequencies the inductor will 
dominate (it fights the rapid changes).  At resonance (ω=  1  L C   ) the frequency is such that 
these two effects balance and the current will be largest in the circuit.  Also at this frequency 
the current is in phase with the driving voltage (the AC power supply).

Seeing it Mathematically – Phasors 
It turns out that a nice way of looking at these relationships is thru 
0 LV 
phasor diagrams.  A phasor is just a vector whose magnitude is the 
amplitude of either the voltage or current through a given circuit 
element and whose angle corresponds to the phase of that voltage or 
current.  In thinking about time dependence of a signal, we allow the 
0CV 
phasors to rotate about the origin (in a counterclockwise fashion) with 
time, and only look at their component along the y-axis.  This 
component oscillates, just like the current and voltages in the circuit. 
We use phasors because they allow us to add voltages across different circuit elements even 
though those voltages are not in phase with each other (so you can’t just add them as 
numbers).   For example, the phasor diagram above illustrates the relationship of voltages in 
a series LRC circuit.  The current I is assigned to be at “0 phase” (along the x-axis).  The 
phase of the voltage across the resistor is the same.  The voltage across the inductor L leads 
(is ahead of I) and the voltage across the capacitor C lags (is behind I).  If you add up (using 
vector arithmetic) the voltages across R, L & C (the red and dashed blue & green lines 
respectively)  you must arrive at the voltage across the power supply.  This then gives you a 
rapid way of understanding the phase between the drive (the power supply) and the response 
(the current) – here labeled φ.

Experiment 11:  Driven LRC Circuits 
Preparation:  Read lab write-up. 

This lab consists of two parts.  In the first you will see how qualitatively the amplitude and 
phase of the current in an LRC circuit change as a function of drive frequency.  In the second 
you will plot the amplitude dependence and measure the quality factor (Q) of the circuit.
