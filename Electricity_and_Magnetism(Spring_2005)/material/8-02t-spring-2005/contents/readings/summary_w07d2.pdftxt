Topic Introduction 
Today we cover two topics. At first we continue the discussion of forces on dipoles in non (cid:173)
uniform fields, and show some examples of using this to levitate objects – frogs, sumo 
wrestlers, etc. After a lab in which we measure magnetic forces and obtain a measurement of 
µ0, we then consider Ampere’s Law, the magnetic equivalent of Gauss’s Law. 

Magnetic Levitation 
Last time we saw that when magnetic dipoles are in non-uniform fields that they feel a force. 
If they are aligned with the field they tend to seek the strongest field (just as electric dipoles 
in a non-uniform electric field do). If they are anti-aligned with the field they tend to seek the 
weakest field. These facts can be easily seen by considering the energy of a dipole in a 
G G 
magnetic field: U  = −µ ⋅ B . Unfortunately these forces can’t be used to stably levitate simple 
bar magnets (try it – repulsive levitation modes are unstable to flipping, and attractive 
levitation modes are unstable to “snapping” to contact). However, they can be used to levitate 
diamagnets – materials who have a magnetic moment which always points opposite the 
direction of field in which they are sitting. We begin briefly discussing magnetic materials, 
for now just know that most materials are diamagnetic (water is, and hence so are frogs), and 
that hence they don’t like magnetic fields. Using this, we can levitate them.  

Neat, but is it useful? Possibly yes. Magnetic levitation allows the creation of frictionless 
bearings, Maglev (magnetically levitated) trains, and, of course, floating frogs.  

Ampere’s Law 
With electric fields we saw that rather than always using Coulomb’s law, which gives a 
completely generic method of obtaining the electric field from charge distributions, when the 
distributions were highly symmetric it became more convenient to use Gauss’s Law to 
calculate electric fields. The same is true of magnetic fields – Biot-Savart does not always 
provide the easiest method of calculating the field. In cases where the current source is very 
symmetric it turns out that Ampere’s Law, another of Maxwell’s four equations, can be used, 
greatly simplifying the task.  

Ampere’s law rests on the idea that if you have a curl in a magnetic field (that is, if it wraps 
around in a circle) that the field must be generated by some current source inside that circle 
(at the center of the curl). So, if we walk around a loop and add up the magnetic field heading 
in our direction, then if, when we finish walking around, we have seen a net field wrapping in 
the direction we walked, there must be some current penetrating the loop we just walked 
G 
G s = µ0 I p e n e t r a t e  , where on the left we 
around. Mathematically this idea is expressed as:  v∫ B ⋅ d

are integrating the magnetic field as we walk around a closed loop, and on the right we add 
up the total amount of current penetrating the loop.  

In the example pictured here, a single long wire carries current 
out of the page.  As we discussed in class, this generates a 
magnetic field looping counter-clockwise around it (blue lines).  
On the figure we draw two “Amperian Loops.”  The first loop 
(yellow) has current I penetrating it.  The second loop (red) has 
no current penetrating it.  Note that as you walk around the 
yellow loop the magnetic field always points in roughly the

G s ≠ 0 , whereas around the
v

same direction as the path:   ∫ B ⋅ d
red loop sometimes the field points with you, sometimes 
G 
G 
v 
against you:  ∫ B ⋅ d s 
= 0 .

We use Ampere’s law in a very similar way to how we used Gauss’s law.  For highly 
symmetric current distributions, we know that the produced magnetic field is constant along 
certain paths.  For example, in the picture above the magnetic field is constant around any 
blue circle.  The integral then becomes simple multiplication along those paths

Today we will measure another fundamental constant, µ0.  In SI units, µ0 is actually a defined 
constant, of value 4π x 10-7 T m/A.  We will measure µ0 by measuring the force between two 
current loops, by balancing that force against the force of gravity.  This is similar to our 
measurement of ε0 by balancing the electric force on a piece of foil between two capacitor 
plates against the force of gravity on it.  The lab is straight-forward, but important for a 
couple of reasons: 1) it is amazing that in 20 minutes you can accurately measure one of the 
fundamental constants of nature and 2) it is important to understand how the currents in wires 
lead to forces between them.  For example, to make the coils repel, should the currents in 
them be parallel or anti-parallel?
