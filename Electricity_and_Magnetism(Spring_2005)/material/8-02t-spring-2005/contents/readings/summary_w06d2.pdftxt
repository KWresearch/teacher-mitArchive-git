(6) Magnetic Force on Current-Carrying Wires 

Topic Introduction 
Last class we focused on the forces that moving charges feel when in a magnetic field. 
Today we will extend this to currents in wires, and then discuss how moving charges and 
currents can also create magnetic fields.  The presentation is analogous to our discussion of 
charges creating electric fields.  We first describe the magnetic field generated by a single 
charge and then proceed to collections of moving charges (currents), the fields from which 
we will calculate using superposition – just like for continuous charge distributions. 

Lorenz Force on Currents 
Since a current is nothing more than moving charges, a current carrying wire will also feel a

force when placed in a magnetic field:  F = IL × B  (where I is the current, and L is a vector 
pointing along the axis of the wire, with magnitude equal to the length of the wire).   

Field from a Single Moving Charge 
Just as a single electric charge creates an electric field which is proportional to charge q and 
falls off as r-2, a single moving electric charge additionally creates a magnetic field given by

Note the similarity to Coulomb’s law for the electric field – the field is proportional to the 
charge q, obeys an inverse square law in r, and depends on a constant, the permeability of 
free space µ0 = 4π x 10-7 T m/A.  The difference is that the field no longer points along  rˆ but 
is instead perpendicular to it (because of the cross product).   

Field from a Current:  Biot-Savart Law 
We can immediately switch over from discrete charges to currents by replacing  q v G with  Id s G :

This is the Biot-Savart formula, and, like the differential form of Coulomb’s Law, provides a 
generic method for calculating fields – here magnetic fields generated by currents.  The ds in 
this formula is a small length of the wire carrying the current I, so that I ds plays the same 
role that dq did when we calculated electric fields from continuous charge distributions.  To 
find the total magnetic field at some point in space you integrate over the current distribution 
(e.g. along the length of the wire), adding up the field generated by each little part of it ds. 

Right Hand Rules 
Because of the cross product in the Biot-Savart Law, the direction of the resulting magnetic 
field is not as simple as when we were working with electric fields.  In order to quickly see 
what direction the field will be in, or what direction the force on a moving particle will be in,

we can use a “Right Hand Rule.” 
At times it seems that everyone has their own, 
unique, right hand rule. 
Certainly there are a number of them out there, and you 
should feel free to use whichever allow you to get the correct answer.  Here I 
describe the three that I use (starting with one useful for today’s lab). 

The important thing to remember is that cross-products yield a result which is 
perpendicular to both of the input vectors.  The only open question is in which of 
the two perpendicular directions will the result point (e.g. if the vectors are in the 
floor does their cross product point up or down?).

2)  For determining the direction of the magnetic field generated by a 
current:  fields wrap around currents the same direction that your 
fingers wrap around your thumb.  At any point the field points tangent 
to the circle your fingers will make as you twist your hand keeping 
your thumb along the current.

3)  For determining the direction of the force of a field on a moving 
charge:  open your hand perfectly flat.  Put your thumb along v and 
your fingers along B.  Your palm points along the direction of the 
force.

Experiment 6:  Magnetic Force on Current-Carrying Wires 
Preparation:  Read lab write-up. 

In this lab you will be able to feel the force between a current carrying wire and a permanent 
magnet.  Before making the measurements try to determine what kind of force you should

feel.  For straight wires the easiest way to determine this is to use the formula 
to determine what direction the field is in remembering that the permanent magnet is a 
dipole, creating fields which loop from its North to its South pole.  For a coil of wire, the 
easiest way to determine the force is to think of the coil as a magnet itself.  A coil of wire 
creates a field very much like that you measured last time for the Earth and the bar magnets.  
In fact, we will treat a coil of wire just like a dipole.  So to determine the force on the coil, 
replace it in your mind with a bar magnet (oriented with the N pole pointing the way your 
thumb does when you wrap your fingers in the direction of current) and ask “How will these 
two magnets interact?”
