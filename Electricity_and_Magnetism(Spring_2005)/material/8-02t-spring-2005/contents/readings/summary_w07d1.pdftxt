(7) Forces and Torques on Magnetic Dipoles 

Topic Introduction 
This class continues a topic that was introduced on Friday – magnetic dipoles. 

Magnetic Dipole Moment 
In the Friday problem solving session we saw that the torque on a loop of 
current in a magnetic field could be written in the same form as the torque 
G 
on an electric dipole in an electric field,  τG = µ G × B , where the dipole moment 
G 
G
is written  µ = IA , with the direction of A, the area vector, determined by a 
right hand rule: 

Right Hand Rule for Direction of Dipole Moment 
To determine the direction of the dipole moment of a coil of wire:  wrap 
your fingers in the direction of current.  Your thumb points in the direction 
of the North pole of the dipole (in the direction of the dipole moment µ of 
the coil). 

Forces on Magnetic Dipole Moments 
So we have looked at the fields created by dipoles and 
the torques they feel when placed in magnetic fields.  
Today we will look at the forces they feel in fields.  Just 
as with electric dipoles, magnetic dipoles only feel a 
force when in a non-uniform field.  Although it is 
possible to calculate forces on dipole moments using an 
G 
G G G 
equation  ( F 
= (µ ⋅ ∇ ) B )  it’s actually much more 
Dipole 
instructive to think about what forces will result by 
thinking of the dipole as one bar magnet, and imagining 
what arrangement of bar magnets would be required to create the non-uniform magnetic field 
in which it is sitting.  Once this has been done, determining the force is straight forward 
(opposite poles of magnets attract).           

As an example of this, consider a current loop sitting in a diverging magnetic field (pictured 
above).  In what direction is the force on the loop?

In order to answer this question one could use the right hand rule and 
find that the force on every current element is outward and downward, 
An often easier way is to realize that the 
so the net force is down. 
current loop looks like a bar magnet with its North pole facing up and 
that the way to create a field as pictured is to put another bar magnet 
with North pole up below it (as pictured at left).  
Once redrawn in this 
fashion it is clear the dipole will be attracted downwards, towards the 
source of the magnetic field.  

A third way to think about the forces on dipoles in fields is by looking 
GG 
− ⋅µ  B 
at their energy in a field: U 
. 
That is, dipoles can reduce their
=
energy by rotating to align with an external field (hence the torque). 
Once aligned they will move to high B regions in order to further 
reduce their energy (make it more negative).

Experiment 7:  Forces and Torques on Magnetic Dipoles 
Preparation:  Read lab write-up. 

This lab will be performed through a combination of lecture demonstrations and table top 
measurements.  The goal is to understand the forces and torques on magnetic dipoles in 
uniform and non-uniform magnetic fields.  To investigate this we use the “TeachSpin 
apparatus,” which consists of a Helmholtz coil (two wire coils that can produce either 
uniform or non-uniform magnetic fields depending on the direction of current flow in the 
coils) and a small bar magnet which is free both to move and rotate.
