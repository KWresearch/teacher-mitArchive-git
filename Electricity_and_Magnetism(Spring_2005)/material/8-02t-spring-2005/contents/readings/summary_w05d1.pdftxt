Topic Introduction 
Today we will continue our discussion of circuits, and see what we happens when we include 
capacitors. 

Circuits 
Remember that the fundamental new concept when discussing circuits is that, as opposed to 
when we were discussing electrostatics, charges are now allowed to flow.  The amount of 
flow is referred to as the current.  A circuit can be considered to consist of two types of 
objects:  nodes and branches.  The current is constant through any branch, because it has 
nowhere else to go.  Charges can’t sit down and take a break – there is always another charge 
behind them pushing them along.  At nodes, however, charges have a choice.  However the 
sum of the currents entering a node is equal to the sum of the currents exiting a node – all 
charges come from somewhere and go somewhere. 

In the last class we talked about batteries, which can lift the potentials of charges (like a ski 
lift carrying them from the bottom to the top of a mountain), and resistors, which reduce the 
potential of charges traveling through them. 

When we first discussed capacitors, we stressed their ability to store charge, because the 
charges on one plate have no way of getting to the other plate.  They perform this same role 
in circuits.  There is no current through a capacitor – all the charges entering one plate of a 
capacitor simply end up getting stopped there.  However, at the same time that those charges 
flow in, and equal number of charges flow off of the other plate, maintaining the current in 
the branch.  This is important:  the current is the same on either side of the capacitor, there 
just isn’t any current inside the capacitor. 

A capacitor is fundamentally different in this way from a resistor and battery.  As more 
current flows to the capacitor, more charge builds up on its plates, and it becomes more and 
more difficult to charge it (the potential difference across it increases).  Eventually, when the 
potential across the capacitor becomes equal to the potential driving the current (say, from a 
battery), the current stops.  Thus putting a capacitor in a circuit introduces a time-dependence 
to the current flow.

A simple RC circuit (a circuit with a battery, resistor, capacitor and 
switch) is shown at the top of the next page.  When the switch is closed, 
current will flow in the circuit, but as time goes on this current will 
decrease.  We can write down the differential equation for current flow 
∆
=
by writing down Kirchhoff’s loop rules, recalling that  V Q C
 for a 
capacitor and that the charge Q on the capacitor is related to current 
= ±
flowing in the circuit by  I
dQ dt
, where the sign depends on whether the current is 
flowing into the positively charged plate (+) or the negatively charged plate (-).  We won’t do 
this here, but the solution to this differential equation shows that the current decreases 
exponentially from its initial value while the potential on the 
capacitor grows exponentially to its final value.  In fact, in RC 
circuits any value that you could ask about (potential drop across 
the resistor, across the capacitor, …) either grows or decays 
exponentially.  The rate at which this change happens is dictated 
by the “time constant” τ, which for this simple circuit is given by 
RCτ=
. 
 
 
Once the current stops what can happen?  We have now charged 
the capacitor, and the energy and charge stored is ready to escape.  
If we short out the battery (by replacing it with a wire, for 
example) the charge will flow right back off (in the opposite 
direction it flowed on) with the potential on the capacitor now 
decaying exponentially (along with the current) until all the charge 
has left and the capacitor is discharged.  If the resistor is very small 
so that the time constant is small, this discharge can be very fast 
and – like the demo a couple weeks ago – explosive.

Preparation:  Read lab write-up.   
 
This lab will allow you to explore the phenomena described above in a real circuit that you 
build with resistors and capacitors.  You will gain experience with measuring potential (a 
voltmeter needs to be in parallel with the element we are measuring the potential drop 
across) and current (an ammeter needs to be in series with the element we are measuring the 
current through).  You will also learn how to measure time constants (think about this before 
class please) and see how changing circuit elements can change the time constant.
