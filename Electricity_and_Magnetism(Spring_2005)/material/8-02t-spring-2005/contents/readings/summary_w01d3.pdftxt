Topics:  Line and Surface Integrals 

Topic Introduction 
Today we go over some of the mathematical concepts we will need in the first few weeks of 
the course, so that you see the mathematics before being introduced to the physics.  
Maxwell’s equations as we will state them involve line and surface integrals over open and 
closed surfaces.  A closed surface has an inside and an outside, e.g. a basketball, and there is 
no two dimensional contour that “bounds” the surface.  In contrast, an open surface has no 
inside and outside, e.g. a flat infinitely thin plate, and there is a two dimensional contour that 
bounds the surface, e.g. the rim of the plate.  There are four Maxwell’s equations:

Equations (1) and (2) apply to closed surfaces.  Equations (3) and (4) apply to open surfaces, 
and the contour C represents the line contour that bounds those open surfaces. 

There is not need to understand the details of the electromagnetic application right now; we 
simply want to cover the mathematics in this problem solving session.   

Line Integrals 
The line integral of a scalar function  f  x y  z )  along a path C is defined as

Surface Integrals 
A function  F x  y )  of two variables can be integrated over a surface S, and the result is a 
( ,
double integral: 

∫∫S 

∫∫S 
F  x  y  dA = 
( ,
)  

F  x  y  dx dy 
( ,
)

where  dA = dx dy is a (Cartesian) differential area element on S. In particular, when 
( ,F x  y  ) = 1 , we obtain the area of the surface S: 

A = ∫∫S 

∫∫S
