Topic Introduction 
Today we will talk about how to generate electromagnetic waves.  We will also discuss one 
of the most common types of antennae, the quarter-wavelength antenna, and then do a lab 
using a type of this antenna, called the spark-gap transmitter.   

Polarization 
As mentioned in the last class, EM waves are transverse waves – the E & B fields are both 
perpendicular to the direction of propagation  pˆ as well as to each other.  Given  pˆ , the E & B 
fields can thus oscillate along an infinite number of directions (any direction perpendicular to 
pˆ ).  We call the axis that the E field is oscillating along the polarization axis (often a 
“polarization direction” is stated, but since the E field oscillates, sometimes E points along 
the polarization direction, sometimes opposite it).  When light has a specific polarization 
direction we say that it is polarized.  Most light (for example, that coming from the sun or 
from light bulbs) is unpolarized – the electric fields are oscillating along lots of different 
axes.  However, in certain cases light can become polarized.  A very common example is that 
when light scatters off of a surface only the polarization which is parallel to that surface 
survives.  This is why Polaroid sunglasses are useful.  They stop all light which is 
horizontally polarized, thus blocking a large fraction of light which reflects off of horizontal 
surfaces (glare).  If you happen to own a pair of Polaroid sunglasses, you can find other 
situations in which light becomes polarized.  Rainbows, for example, are polarized.  So is the 
sky under the right conditions (can you figure out what the conditions are?)  This is because 
the blue light that you see in the sky is scattered sun light. 

Generating Plane Electromagnetic Waves:  How 
do we generate plane electromagnetic waves?  We do 
this by shaking a sheet of charge up and down, 
making waves on the electric field lines of the charges 
in the sheet.  We discuss this process quantitatively in 
this lecture, and show that the work that we do to 
shake the sheet up and down provides exactly the 
amount of energy carried away in electromagnetic 
waves.

Quarter-Wavelength Antenna:  How do we 
generate electric dipole radiation?  Again, by 
shaking charge, but this time not an infinite plane of 
charge, but a line of charge on an antenna.  At left is 
an illustration of a quarter wavelength antenna.  It is 
quite simple in principle.  An oscillator drives 
charges back and forth from one end of the antenna 
to the other (at the moment pictured the top is 
positive the bottom negative, but this will change in 
half a period).  This separation of charge creates an 
electric field that points from the positive to the 
negative side of the antenna.  This field also begins 
to propagate away from the antenna (in the 
direction of the Poynting vector S).  When the 
charge changes sides the field will flip directions – hence you have an oscillating electric 
field that is propagating away from the antenna.  This changing E field generates a changing 
B field, as pictured, and you thus have an electromagnetic wave.  Why is this called a quarter 
wavelength antenna?  The length of each part of the antenna above (e.g. the top half) is about 
equal in length to ¼ of the wavelength if the radiation that it produces.  Why is that?  The 
charges move at close to the speed of light in the antenna so that in making one complete 
oscillation of the wave (by moving from the top to the bottom and back again) they move 
about as far as the wave has itself (one wavelength).

Experiment 12:  Microwaves 
Preparation:  Read lab write-up.   
In today’s lab you will create microwaves (EM radiation with a wavelength of several 
centimeters) using a spark gap transmitter.  This is a type of quarter wavelength antenna that 
works on the principles described above.  You will measure the polarization of the produced 
EM waves, and try to understand the intensity distribution created by such an antenna (where 
is the signal the strongest?  The weakest?)  You will also measure the wavelength of the 
radiation by creating a standing wave by reflecting the waves off of a metal wall and 
allowing them to interfere with the waves created by the antenna.
