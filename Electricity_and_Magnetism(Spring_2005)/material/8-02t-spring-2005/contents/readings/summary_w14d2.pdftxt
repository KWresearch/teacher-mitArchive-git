Topic Introduction 
Today we will investigate the subject of interference, both theoretically and experimentally.  
We not only have a fun lab – you get to play with a laser, shining it through slits and 
bouncing it off of CDs – but one that is also very useful in solidifying your conceptual 
picture of interference.  Make sure that you pay attention to this latter aspect as this material 
will be covered on the final. 

The General Picture 

Consider two traveling waves, moving through space:

Constructive 
Interference 

The picture at left forms the basis of all the 
phenomena we will observe today.  Two different 
waves (red & blue) arrive at a single position in 
space (at the screen).  If they are in phase then 
they add constructively and you see a bright spot. 
If they are out of phase then the add destructively 
and you see nothing (dark spot).  In today’s 
experiments the relative phase between the 
incoming waves changes as a function of lateral 
position on the screen. 
The key to creating interference is creating phase 
shift between two waves that are then brought together at a single position.  A common way 
to do that is to add extra path length to one of the waves relative to the other.  We will look at 
a variety of systems in which that happens.

Two Slit Interference 

The first phenomenon we consider is two slit 
interference.  Light from the laser hits two very narrow 
slits, which then act like in-phase point sources of light.  
In traveling from the slits to the screen, however, the 
light from the two slits travel different distances.  In the 
picture at left the light from the bottom slit travels 
further than the light from the top slit.  This extra path 
length introduces a phase shift between the two waves 
and leads to a position dependent interference pattern 
on the screen. 
Here the extra path length is δ= d  s i  n  (θ) , leading to a phase shift φgiven by  δ
φ
.

λ  2π 
Realizing that phase shifts that are multiples of 2π give us constructive interference while 
odd multiples of π lead to destructive interference leads to the following conditions:  
Maxima:  d  s i n  (θ) = mλ ;  Minima:  d  s i  n  (θ) = ( m  + 1  ) λ2

Diffraction 

The next kind of interference we consider is light going through 
a single slit, interfering with itself.  This is called diffraction, 
and arises from the finite width of the slit (a in the picture at 
left).  The resultant effect is not nearly as easy to derive as that 
from two-slit interference (which, as you can see from above, is 
straight-forward).  The result for the anglular locations of the 
minima is  a  s i  n  (θ) = mλ. 

Putting it Together 
If you have two wide slits, that is, slits that exhibit both diffraction and interference, the 
pattern observed on a distant screen is as follows: 

Here the amplitude modulation (the red envelope) is set by the diffraction (the width of the 
slits), while the “individual wiggles” are due to the interference between the light coming 
from the two different slits.  You know that this must be the case because d must be larger 
than a, and hence the minima locations, which go like 1/d, are closer together for the two slit 
pattern than for the single slit pattern.
