A plane E&M wave is generated by 
shaking a sheet of charge up and down. 
At the time shown, the sheet is moving 

1. Up 
2. Down 
3. The sheet is not moving at this time 
4. Don't Have A Clue

Answer:  (1) Down.  We can see this 
because the magnetic field is consistent 
with a current sheet carrying current 
downwards.  Also, if we are moving the 
sheet downwards, the perturbation 
electric field right at the sheet is upwards, 
as it must be if it is to resist the fact that 
we are moving the sheet downwards.

At the time shown the charge on the top 
half of our ¼ wave antenna is positive and 
at its maximum value.  At this time: 
1.  The current across the spark gap is 
about zero. 
2.  The current across the spark gap is 
maximum and downward. 
3.  The current across the spark gap is 
maximum and upward. 
4.  Can’t tell from the information given. 




PRS32 

Answer:  (1) The current is about zero. 
The charge on the top half of the antenna 
is at its maximum value, and therefore the 
current, which is the time rate of change 
of the charge, must be neat zero.

When located as shown, our receiving 
antenna sees maximum power when 
oriented such that 
1.  Its straight portion is parallel to the 

straight portion of the transmitter  

2.  Its straight portion is perpendicular to 
the straight portion of the transmitter 
3.  Don’t have a clue.

Answer:  1.  The electric field pattern 
from the spark gap antenna is shown 
above.  When positioned as shown, the 
receiving antenna gets maximum power 
when parallel to the transmitting antenna 
wire, because the electric field can then 
drive the maximum current in the 
receiver.  We say that the wave is 
“polarized” in the direction of the E field.

As we move our receiving antenna around 
the spark gap transmitting antenna in the 
manner shown in the figure, we will see 
1. Increased received power at position B 
as compared to position A 
2. Decreased received power at position B 
as compared to position A 
3. No change in received power when the 
receiver is at position B as compared to 
position A 
4. Don’t have a clue.  




PRS32 

Answer:  2.  Maximum power at A.  


The electric field pattern from the spark 
gap antenna is shown above.  We get 
maximum power when the line from the 
transmitter to the receiver is 
perpendicular to the  direction of the 
antenna (at A).  We get (in principle) zero 
power when the line from the transmitter 
to the receiver lies along the direction of 
the antenna (at B).
