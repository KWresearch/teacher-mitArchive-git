Look where current is 
into/out of page – force is in 
plane of the page. 
IMPORTANT:  Field lines 
are not straight up!

1. points towards the +x direction 
2. points towards the +y direction 
3. points towards the +z direction 
4. points towards the -x direction 
5. points towards the -y direction 
6. points towards the -z direction 
7. points nowhere because it is zero

(6) B is in the –z direction 
ˆj 

The vertical line 
segment 
contributes 
nothing to the 
field at P (it is 
parallel to the 
displacement). 
The horizontal segment 
makes a field into the page.

Curved Wire


The magnetic field at P is equal 
to the field of: 
1. a semicircle 
2. a semicircle plus the 
field of a long straight wire 
3. a semicircle loop minus 
the field of a long straight wire 
4. none of the above 

Curved Wire


PRS15 

(2)  Semicircle + long, 
straight wire 

All of the wire makes B into 
the page.  The two straight 
parts, if put together, would 
make an infinite wire.  The 
semicircle is added to this to 
get the complete field

Two Particles 
Two positive charges are mounted 
on tracks that force them to move at 
constant velocities. The magnetic 
force on the charge q1 due to q2 
points in the direction of: 

4. -x 
1. +x 
5. -y 
2. +y 
3. +z 
6. -z 
7. Nothing (zero force) 
8. Points in some other direction

(2) The force is up (+y direction) 

q2 generates a B field out of the page 
(+z) at q1.G
G 
v B   ˆi k = ˆj 
× = − × ˆ
So the force is in the +y 
direction.
