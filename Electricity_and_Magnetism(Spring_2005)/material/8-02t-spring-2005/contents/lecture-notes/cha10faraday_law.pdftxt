10.1  Faraday’s Law of Induction 
 
The  electric  fields  and  magnetic  fields  considered  up  to  now  have  been  produced  by 
stationary charges and moving charges (currents), respectively. Imposing an electric field 
on a conductor gives rise to a current which in turn generates a magnetic field. One could 
then  inquire  whether  or  not  an  electric  field  could  be  produced  by  a  magnetic  field.  In 
1831, Michael  Faraday  discovered  that,  by  varying magnetic  field  with  time,  an  electric 
field could be generated. The phenomenon is known as electromagnetic induction. Figure 
10.1.1 illustrates one of Faraday’s experiments. 
 

 

 

 

 
Figure 10.1.1 Electromagnetic induction 

 
Faraday  showed  that  no  current  is  registered  in  the  galvanometer  when  bar  magnet  is 
stationary  with  respect  to  the  loop.  However,  a  current  is  induced  in  the  loop  when  a 
relative  motion  exists  between  the  bar  magnet  and  the  loop.  In  particular,  the 
galvanometer  deflects  in  one  direction  as  the  magnet  approaches  the  loop,  and  the 
opposite direction as it moves away.  
 
Faraday’s  experiment  demonstrates  that  an  electric  current  is  induced  in  the  loop  by 
changing  the  magnetic  field.  The  coil  behaves  as  if  it  were  connected  to  an  emf  source. 
Experimentally  it  is  found  that  the  induced  emf  depends  on  the  rate  of  change  of 
magnetic flux through the coil.

10.1.1  Magnetic Flux 
 
Consider a uniform magnetic field passing through a surface S, as shown in Figure 10.1.2 
below:

The SI unit of magnetic flux is the weber (Wb): 
 
 
 
Faraday’s law of induction may be stated as follows: 
 
The  induced  emf ε in  a  coil  is  proportional  to  the  negative  of  the  rate  of  change  of 
magnetic flux: 
 
 
 
 
For a coil that consists of N loops, the total induced emf would be N times as large: 
 
 
 
(cid:71)
Combining Eqs. (10.1.3) and (10.1.1), we obtain, for a spatially uniform field  B ,

10.1.2  Lenz’s Law 
 
The direction of the induced current is determined by Lenz’s law: 
 
 The  induced  current  produces  magnetic  fields  which  tend  to  oppose  the  change  in 
magnetic flux that induces such currents.  
 
To illustrate how Lenz’s law works, let’s consider a conducting loop placed in a magnetic 
field. We follow the procedure below: 
 
(cid:71)
1. Define a positive direction for the area vector A
 
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
2.  Assuming  that  B  is  uniform,  take  the  dot  product  of  B and
determination of the sign of the magnetic flux 
BΦ .  
 
3.  Obtain the rate of flux change
 

 by differentiation. There are three possibilities: 

.  This  allows  for  the

4.  Determine  the  direction  of  the  induced  current  using  the  right-hand  rule.  With  your

,  curl  the  fingers  around  the  closed  loop.  The

In  Figure  10.1.7  we  illustrate  the  four  possible  scenarios  of  time-varying  magnetic  flux 
and show how Lenz’s law is used to determine the direction of the induced current  I .

The  positive  and  negative  signs  of  I  correspond  to  a  counterclockwise  and  clockwise 
currents, respectively.  
 
As an example  to  illustrate how Lenz’s  law may be applied, consider  the  situation where 
a  bar magnet  is moving  toward  a  conducting  loop with  its  north  pole  down,  as  shown  in 
Figure  10.1.8(a).  With  the  magnetic  field  pointing  downward  and  the  area  vector 
(cid:71)
A
pointing upward, the magnetic flux is negative, i.e., 
BA
< , where A is the area 
0
Φ = −
B
of  the  loop. As  the magnet moves  closer  to  the  loop,  the magnetic  field  at  a  point  on  the 
/dB dt > 0
loop increases (
), producing more flux through the plane of the loop. Therefore, 
0ε> ,  and  the  induced

Φ

<
current  flows  in  the  counterclockwise  direction.  The  current  then  sets  up  an  induced 
magnetic  field  and  produces  a  positive  flux  to  counteract  the  change.  The  situation 
described here corresponds to that illustrated in Figure 10.1.7(c). 
 
Alternatively,  the  direction  of  the  induced  current  can  also  be  determined  from  the  point 
of view of magnetic force. Lenz’s law states that the induced emf must be in the direction 
that opposes the change. Therefore, as the bar magnet approaches the loop, it experiences 

 

5

a repulsive force due  to  the  induced emf.   Since  like poles repel,  the loop must behave as 
if  it  were  a  bar  magnet  with  its  north  pole  pointing  up.  Using  the  right-hand  rule,  the 
direction of the induced current is counterclockwise, as view from above. Figure 10.1.8(b) 
illustrates how this alternative approach is used.

10.2  Motional EMF 
 
Consider  a  conducting  bar  of  length  l  moving  through  a  uniform  magnetic  field  which

,  or  E v .  Between  the  two  ends  of  the  conductor,  there  exists  a 
B=
we  have qvB qE=
potential difference given by 
 
 
 
Sinceε arises  from  the  motion  of  the  conductor,  this  potential  difference  is  called  the 
motional emf. In general, motional emf around a closed conducting loop can be written as

(cid:71)
ˆB= −B
k  (pointing  into  the  page)  by  sliding  along  two  frictionless  conducting  rails  that 
are  at  a  distance  l  apart  and  connected  together  by  a  resistor with  resistance R,  as  shown 
in Figure 10.2.2.

. Upon integration, we obtain 

 
where

Thus,  we  see  that  the  speed  decreases  exponentially  in  the  absence  of  an  external  agent 
doing work.  In  principle,  the  bar  never  stops moving. However,  one may  verify  that  the 
total distance traveled is finite.   
 
 
10.3  Induced Electric Field 
 
In Chapter 3, we have seen that the electric potential difference between two points A and 
(cid:71)
B in an electric field  E
can be written as  
 
 
 
When  the electric  field  is conservative, as  is  the case of electrostatics,  the  line  integral of 
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
(cid:118)
∫ E s =
d⋅E s
. 
is path-independent, which implies 
d⋅
0
 
Faraday’s  law  shows  that  as magnetic  flux  changes with  time,  an  induced  current begins 
to  flow. What  causes  the  charges  to move?  It  is  the  induced  emf which  is  the work done 
per  unit  charge.  However,  since  magnetic  field  can  do  not  work,  as  we  have  shown  in 
Chapter 8,  the work done on  the mobile charges must be electric, and  the electric field  in 
this situation cannot be conservative because the line integral of a conservative field must 
vanish.  Therefore,  we  conclude  that  there  is  a  non-conservative  electric  field 
(cid:71)
ncE
associated with an induced emf:  
 
 
 
Combining with Faraday’s law then yields 
 
 
 
The  above  expression  implies  that  a  changing  magnetic  flux  will  induce  a  non-
conservative  electric  field  which  can  vary  with  time.  It  is  important  to  distinguish 
between  the  induced,  non-conservative  electric  field  and  the  conservative  electric  field 
which arises from electric charges. 
 
As an example,  let’s consider a uniform magnetic  field which points  into  the page and  is 
confined  to  a  circular  region  with  radius  R,  as  shown  in  Figure  10.3.1.  Suppose  the

. Let’s  find the induced electric field 

(cid:71)
/dB dt > 0
 increases with time, i.e., 
magnitude of 
B
everywhere due to the changing magnetic field. 
 
Since  the  magnetic  field  is  confined  to  a  circular  region,  from  symmetry  arguments  we 
choose  the  integration  path  to  be  a  circle  of  radius  r. The magnitude  of  the  induced  field 
(cid:71)
ncE
 at  all  points  on  a  circle  is  the  same.  According  to  Lenz’s  law,  the  direction  of 
(cid:71)
ncE
must  be  such  that  it  would  drive  the  induced  current  to  produce  a  magnetic  field 
(cid:71)
opposing  the  change  in  magnetic  flux.  With  the  area  vector  A
pointing  out  of  the  page, 
/dB dt > 0
the  magnetic  flux  is  negative  or  inward.  With 
,  the  inward  magnetic  flux  is 
increasing.  Therefore,  to  counteract  this  change  the  induced  current  must  flow 
(cid:71)
ncE
counterclockwise  to  produce more  outward  flux. The  direction  of 
is  shown  in  Figure

10.4  Generators  
 
One of the most important applications of Faraday’s law of induction is to generators and 
motors.  A  generator  converts  mechanical  energy  into  electric  energy,  while  a  motor 
converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.

Figure  10.4.1(a)  is  a  simple  illustration  of  a  generator.  It  consists  of  an  N-turn  loop 
rotating  in  a  magnetic  field  which  is  assumed  to  be  uniform.  The  magnetic  flux  varies 
with time, thereby inducing an emf. From Figure 10.4.1(b), we see that the magnetic flux 
through the loop may be written as

10.5  Eddy Currents 
10.5  Eddy Currents 

We  have  seen  that  when  a  conducting  loop  moves  through  a  magnetic  field,  current  is 
induced as the result of changing magnetic flux. If a solid conductor were used instead of 
a  loop,  as  shown  in  Figure  10.5.1,  current  can  also  be  induced.  The  induced  current 
appears to be circulating and is called an eddy current.  
  

 

 
Figure  10.5.1  Appearance  of  an  eddy  current  when  a  solid  conductor  moves  through  a 
magnetic field. 
 
The  induced  eddy  currents  also  generate  a  magnetic  force  that  opposes  the  motion, 
making it more difficult to move the conductor across the magnetic field (Figure 10.5.2).  
 

 

 
Figure  10.5.2  Magnetic  force  arising  from  the  eddy  current  that  opposes  the  motion  of 
the conducting slab.  

 
Since the conductor has non-vanishing resistance  R , Joule heating causes a loss of power 
by  an  amount 
R ,  power  loss  can  be 
.  Therefore,  by  increasing  the  value  of

reduced.   One way  to  increase  R  is  to  laminate  the conducting slab, or construct  the slab 
by  using  gluing  together  thin  strips  that  are  insulated  from  one  another  (see  Figure 
10.5.3a). Another way  is  to make cuts  in  the slab,  thereby disrupting  the conducting path 
(Figure 10.5.3b).     
 

 

 

 
Figure 10.5.3 Eddy currents can be reduced by (a) laminating the slab, or (b) making cuts 
on the slab.

There are  important applications of eddy currents. For  example,  the  currents can be used 
to  suppress  unwanted  mechanical  oscillations.  Another  application  is  the  magnetic 
braking systems in high-speed transit cars.

 of  the  moving  conductor.  In  addition, 
where 
we  have  also  shown  in  Section  10.4  that  induced  emf  associated  with  a  stationary 
conductor may be written as the line integral of the non-conservative electric field:

However,  whether  an  object  is  moving  or  stationary  actually  depends  on  the  reference 
frame.   As  an  example,  let’s  examine  the  situation where  a  bar magnet  is  approaching  a 
conducting loop. An observer O in the rest frame of the loop sees the bar magnet moving 
(cid:71)

toward the loop. An electric field 
 is induced to drive the current around the loop, and

a  charge  on  the  loop  experiences  an  electric  force

according  to  observer  O,  no  magnetic  force  is  present.  On  the  other  hand,  an  observer

The  straight wire carrying a current  I produces a magnetic  flux  into  the page  through  the 
rectangular  loop.  By  Lenz’s  law,  the  induced  current  in  the  loop  must  be  flowing 
counterclockwise  in  order  to  produce  a  magnetic  field  out  of  the  page  to  counteract  the 
increase in inward flux.

(a)  Describe  qualitatively  the  change  in  magnetic  flux  through  the  loop  when  the  bar 
magnet is above and below the loop. 
 
(b) Make a qualitative sketch of the graph of the induced current in the loop as a function 
of  time,  choosing  I  to  be  positive when  its  direction  is  counterclockwise  as  viewed  from 
above.    
 
2. Two circular loops A and B have their planes parallel to each other, as shown in Figure 
10.10.2. 
 

               

Figure 10.10.2 

 
Loop A has a current moving in the counterclockwise direction, viewed from above.  
 
(a)  If  the  current  in  loop  A  decreases  with  time,  what  is  the  direction  of  the  induced 
current in loop B? Will the two loops attract or repel each other? 
 
(b)  If  the  current  in  loop  A  increases  with  time,  what  is  the  direction  of  the  induced 
current in loop B? Will the two loops attract or repel each other? 
 
3.  A  spherical  conducting  shell  is  placed  in  a  time-varying  magnetic  field.  Is  there  an 
induced current along the equator? 
 
4.  A  rectangular  loop  moves  across  a  uniform  magnetic  field  but  the  induced  current  is 
zero. How is this possible?
