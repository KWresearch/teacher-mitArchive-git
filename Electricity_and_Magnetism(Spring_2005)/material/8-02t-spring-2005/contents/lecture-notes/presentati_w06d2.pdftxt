Lab Summary:
Currents FEEL Forces in 
Magnetic Fields

Question:
What happens if currents are 
next to each other?

Demonstration:
Parallel & Anti-Parallel Currents

How Do They Interact?
Moving charges also create magnetic fields!
The current in one wire creates a magnetic 
field that is felt by the other wire.  
This is the rest of today’s focus

1)  Think about it:
• Legs contribute nothing
I parallel to r
• Ring makes field into page
2)  Choose a ds

Tension and Pressures 
Transmitted by E and B
Fields (E or B):
• Transmit tension along field direction 
(Field lines want to pull straight)
• Exert pressure perpendicular to field 
(Field lines repel)

Example of E Pressure/Tension

ForceQ_f0_320.html)

Positive charge in uniform (downward) E field
Electric force on the charge is combination of 
1. Pressure pushing down from top 
2. Tension pulling down towards bottom

Positive charge moving out of page in uniform 
(downwards) B field.  Magnetic force combines:
1. Pressure pushing from left 
2. Tension pulling to right
