Dipole in Field 

The current carrying coil above 
will move 
1. upwards 
2. downwards 

3. stay where it is because the 
total force is zero

(2)  Coil will move down 

EITHER: The I ds x B forces 
shown produce a net downward 
force 
OR: Think about magnets…

Loop in Changing Field


The magnetic field through a wire 
loop is pointed upwards and 
increasing with time.  The induced 
current in the coil is 

1. Clockwise as seen from the top 

2. Counterclockwise

(1) Current is clockwise.   
 
This produces an “induced” B 
field pointing down over the area 
of the loop.   
 
The “induced” B field opposes the 
increasing flux through the loop – 
Lenz’s Law

Loop in Changing Field


The magnetic field through a 
circular wire loop is pointed 
upwards and decreasing with time. 
The induced current in the coil is 
1. Clockwise as seen from the top 

2. Counterclockwise

(2) Current is counter-clockwise.   
 
This produces an “induced” B 
field pointing up over the area of 
the loop.  
 
The “induced” B field opposes the 
decreasing flux through the loop –

PRS20 

When the coil is below the magnet and 
moving downwards.  This induces a 
current as pictured.  The I ds x B force on 
the coil is 

1. Upwards 

2. Downwards 


3. Zero 



PRS20 

(1)  Upwards 

Lenz’ Law: 
Must oppose motion –  force is up 
More detail:

Induced current is counter-clockwise 

to oppose drop in upward flux. 

This looks like a dipole facing upward, 

so it is attracted to the other dipole
