Conductors in Equilibrium

Conductors are equipotential objects:
1) E = 0 inside
2) Net charge inside is 0
3) E perpendicular to surface 
4) Excess charge on surface

Dielectrics
A dielectric is a non-conductor or insulator
Examples: rubber, glass, waxed paper

When placed in a charged capacitor, the 
dielectric reduces the potential difference 
between the two plates
