LC Circuit
It undergoes simple harmonic motion, just like a 
mass on a spring, with trade-off between charge on 
capacitor (Spring) and current in inductor (Mass)

Analog:  RLC Circuit

Recall:
Inductors are like masses (have inertia)
Capacitors are like springs (store/release energy)
Batteries supply external force (EMF)

Charge on capacitor is like position,
Current is like velocity – watch them resonate

Now we move to “frequency dependent batteries:”
AC Power Supplies/AC Function Generators

Experiment 11:  How To
Part I
• Use exp11a.ds
• Change frequency, look at I & V.  Try 
to find resonance – place where I is 
maximum
Part II
• Use exp11b.ds
• Run the program at each of the listed 
frequencies to make a plot of I0 vs. ω
