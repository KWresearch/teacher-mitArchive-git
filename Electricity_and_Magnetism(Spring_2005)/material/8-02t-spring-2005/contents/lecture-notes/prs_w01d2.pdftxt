PRS02 

Electric field lines in the space 
surrounding a charge distribution show: 

1. Directions of the forces that exist in 
space at all times. 
2. Only directions in which static charges 
would accelerate when at points on 
those lines 
3. Only directions in which moving 
charges would accelerate when at 
points on those lines. 
4. Directions in which either static or 
moving charges would accelerate 
when passing through points on those 
lines. 
5. Paths static or moving charges would 
take. 

PRS02 
(4) Direction of acceleration of charges 

either “in” or “moving through” 


NOTE:  This is different than flow 
lines (5).  Particles do NOT move along 
field lines.

The force between the two charges is: 
1) Attractive 
2) Repulsive 
3) Can’t tell without more information 



PRS02 

(2)  Repulsive 


One way to tell is to notice that they 
both must be sources (or sinks). 
Hence, as like particles repel, the force 
is repulsive. 

You can also see this as tension in the 
field lines

E-Field of Five Equal Charges

Six equal positive charges q sit at the 
vertices of a regular hexagon with sides 
of length R.  We remove the bottom 
charge.  The electric field at the center of 
the hexagon (point P) is:

The electric field at the center is due to 
two pairs of charges across the diagonal 
and the unpaired top charge.  The electric 
fields of the two pairs of charge will 
cancel at the center by symmetry. 
Therefore the electric field at the center 
is due only to the top charge.  The 
distance to the top charge is R, and the 
field points downward. 



E-Field of a Dipole 

PRS02 

As you move to large distances r 
away from a dipole, the electric 
field will fall-off as: 
1) 1/r2, just like a point charge 
2) More rapidly than 1/r2 
3) More slowly than 1/r2 
4) Who knows? 

PRS02 

E-Field of a Dipole 

(2)  It falls off more rapidly 


We know this must be a case by 
thinking about what a dipole looks like 
from a large distance.  To first order, it 
isn’t there (net charge is 0), so the E-
Field must decrease faster. 



PRS02 
An electric dipole, consisting of two 
equal and opposite point charges at the 
ends of an insulating rod, is free to rotate 
about a pivot point in the center.  The rod 
is placed in a non-uniform electric field. 

The dipole will experience 

1. a noticeable electric force and no 
noticeable electric torque 
2. no noticeable electric force and a 
noticeable electric torque 
3. a noticeable electric force and a 
noticeable electric torque 
4. no noticeable electric force and no 
noticeable electric torque 

PRS02 

(3)  A noticeable force and torque 


Because the field is non-uniform, the 
force on the two equal but opposite 
point charges do not cancel. 

As always, the dipole will rotate to 
align with the field, hence there must 
be a torque on the dipole as well
