7.1 Introduction 
 
Electrical  circuits  connect  power  supplies  to  loads  such  as  resistors,  motors,  heaters,  or 
lamps. The  connection  between  the  supply  and  the  load  is made  by  soldering with wires 
that  are  often  called  leads,  or  with  many  kinds  of  connectors  and  terminals.  Energy  is 
delivered from the source to the user on demand at the flick of a switch. Sometimes many 
circuit  elements  are  connected  to  the  same  lead,  which  is  the  called  a  common  lead  for 
those  elements. Various  parts  of  the  circuits  are  called  circuit  elements, which  can  be  in 
series or in parallel, as we have already seen in the case of capacitors. 
 
Elements  are  said  to  be  in  parallel  when  they  are  connected  across  the  same  potential 
difference (see Figure 7.1.1a).  
 

 

 

 

 

Figure 7.1.1 Elements connected (a) in parallel, and (b) in series. 

 
Generally,  loads  are  connected  in  parallel  across  the  power  supply.    On  the  other  hand, 
when  the  elements  are  connected  one  after  another,  so  that  the  current  passes  through 
each element without any branches, the elements are in series (see Figure 7.1.1b).  
 
There are pictorial diagrams that show wires and components roughly as they appear, and 
schematic  diagrams  that  use  conventional  symbols,  somewhat  like  road  maps.  Some 
frequently used symbols are shown below: 
 

Voltage Source 

Resistor 

Switch 

 

 

 

 
Often  there  is  a  switch  in  series; when  the  switch  is open  the  load  is disconnected; when 
the switch is closed, the load is connected.

One can have closed circuits, through which current flows, or open circuits in which there 
are  no  currents.  Usually  by  accident,  wires  may  touch,  causing  a  short  circuit.  Most  of 
the current flows  through  the short, very  little will flow  through  the load.   This may burn 
out  a  piece  of  electrical  equipment  such  as  a  transformer.  To  prevent  damage,  a  fuse  or 
circuit breaker is put in series. When there is a short the fuse blows, or the breaker opens. 
 
In electrical circuits, a point (or some common  lead)  is chosen as  the ground.   This point 
is assigned an arbitrary voltage, usually zero, and the voltage V at any point in the circuit 
is defined as the voltage difference between that point and ground. 
 
7.2 Electromotive Force 
 
In  the  last Chapter, we  have  shown  that  electrical  energy must  be  supplied  to maintain  a 
constant  current  in  a  closed  circuit. The  source  of  energy  is  commonly  referred  to  as  the 
electromotive force, or emf (symbolε). Batteries, solar cells and thermocouples are some 
examples of emf source.  They can be thought of as a “charge pump” that moves charges 
from lower potential to the higher one. Mathematically emf is defined as 
 
 

(7.2.1) 

ε≡

dW
d q

 

 
which  is  the work done  to move a unit charge  in  the direction of higher potential. The SI 
unit for ε is the volt (V).     
 
Consider  a  simple  circuit  consisting  of  a  battery  as  the  emf  source  and  a  resistor  of 
resistance R, as shown in Figure 7.2.1.  
 

 

 

Figure 7.2.1 A simple circuit consisting of a battery and a resistor 

 
V∆
 (or 
Assuming  that  the  battery  has  no  internal  resistance,  the  potential  difference 
terminal  voltage)  between  the  positive  and  the  negative  terminals  of  the  battery  is  equal 
to  the emf 
ε. To drive  the current around the circuit, the battery undergoes a discharging 
process which converts chemical energy to emf (recall that the dimensions of emf are the 
same as energy per charge). The current I can be found by noting that no work is done in 
moving a charge q around a closed loop due to the conservative nature of the electrostatic 
force:

    Figure 7.2.2 

 
When  crossing  from  the  negative  to  the  positive  terminal,  the  potential  increases  by ε. 
On the other hand, as we cross the resistor, the potential decreases by an amount  IR , and 
the  potential  energy  is  converted  into  thermal  energy  in  the  resistor.  Assuming  that  the 
connecting  wire  carries  no  resistance,  upon  completing  the  loop,  the  net  change  in 
potential difference is zero, 
 
 
which implies  
 
 
 
However, a real battery always carries an internal resistance r (Figure 7.2.3a),

Figure  7.2.3(b)  depicts  the  change  in  electric  potential  as  we  traverse  the  circuit 
clockwise.  From  the  Figure,  we  see  that  the  highest  voltage  is  immediately  after  the 
battery. The voltage drops  as  each  resistor  is  crossed. Note  that  the voltage  is  essentially 
constant  along  the  wires.  This  is  because  the  wires  have  a  negligibly  small  resistance 
compared to the resistors. 
 
For a source with emf ε, the power or the rate at which energy is delivered is 
 
 
 
That  the power of  the  source  emf  is  equal  to  the  sum of  the power dissipated  in both  the 
internal and load resistance is required by energy conservation.   
 
 
7.3 Resistors in Series and in Parallel 
 
The two resistors R1 and R2 in Figure 7.3.1 are connected in series to a voltage source V∆ .  
By current conservation, the same current I is flowing through each resistor.

This means  that  almost  all  of  the  current  that  enters  the  node  point will  pass  through  the 
branch  containing  the  smallest  resistance.   So, when  a  short develops  across  a  circuit,  all 
of the current passes through this path of nearly zero resistance. 
 
 
7.4 Kirchhoff’s Circuit Rules 
 
In analyzing circuits, there are two fundamental (Kirchhoff’s) rules: 
 
1. Junction Rule   
 
At  any  point  where  there  is  a  junction  between  various  current  carrying  branches,  by 
current  conservation  the  sum  of  the  currents  into  the  node  must  equal  the  sum  of  the 
currents out of the node (otherwise charge would build up at the junction); 
 
 
 
As an example, consider Figure 7.4.1 below:

whether the closed loop is traversed clockwise or counterclockwise.

7.5 Voltage-Current Measurements 
 
Any instrument that measures voltage or current will disturb the circuit under observation.  
Some  devices,  known  as  ammeters,  will  indicate  the  flow  of  current  by  a  meter 
movement  or  a  digital  display.  There  will  be  some  voltage  drop  due  to  the  resistance  of 
the flow of current through the ammeter.  An ideal ammeter has zero resistance, but in the 
250 mDCA
case  of  your  multimeter,  the  resistance  is   1Ω  on  the 
 range.  The  drop  of 
0.25 V
may or may not be negligible; knowing  the meter resistance allows one  to correct 
for its effect on the circuit. 
 
R
An ammeter can be converted to a voltmeter by putting a resistor 
 in series with the coil 
movement.  The voltage across some circuit element can be determined by connecting the 
coil  movement  and  resistor  in  parallel  with  the  circuit  element.    This  causes  a  small 
amount  of  current  to  flow  through  the  coil  movement.    The  voltage  across  the  element 
I  and computing  the voltage  from  ∆V = IR  ,which 
can now be determined by measuring 
is  read  on  a  calibrated  scale.  The  larger  the  resistance  R ,  the  smaller  the  amount  of 
current  is  diverted  through  the  coil.    Thus  an  ideal  voltmeter  would  have  an  infinite 
resistance.

7.6 RC Circuit  
 
7.6.1  Charging a Capacitor 
 
Consider  the  circuit  shown  below. The  capacitor  is  connected  to  a DC  voltage  source  of 
emf  ε .  At  time t = 0 ,  the  switch  S  is  closed.  The  capacitor  initially  is  uncharged, 
.

,  there  is no voltage  across  the  capacitor  so  the  capacitor  acts  like  a 
, the switch is closed and current begins to flow according to  
ε=
 
R

 
In particular  for 
short circuit. At 
 
 
 
At  this  instant,  the  potential  difference  from  the  battery  terminals  is  the  same  as  that 
across  the  resistor.  This  initiates  the  charging  of  the  capacitor.  As  the  capacitor  starts  to 
charge, the voltage across the capacitor increases in time

 for  the  current.  Since  I  must  be  the  same  in  all 
where  we  have  substituted 
dq dt
I
/
= +
parts  of  the  series  circuit,  the  current  across  the  resistance  R  is  equal  to  the  rate  of 
increase of charge on  the capacitor plates. The current flow  in  the circuit will continue  to 
decrease because  the charge already present on  the capacitor makes  it harder  to put more 
charge  on  the  capacitor.  Once  the  charge  on  the  capacitor  plates  reaches  its  maximum 
value Q,  the  current  in  the  circuit will drop  to  zero. This  is  evident by  rewriting  the  loop 
law as 
 
 
 
Thus, the charging capacitor satisfies a first order differential equation that relates the rate 
of change of charge to the charge on the capacitor:

Once we  know  the  charge  on  the  capacitor we  also  can  determine  the  voltage  across  the

The  graph  of  voltage  as  a  function  of  time  has  the  same  form  as  Figure  7.6.3.  From  the 
figure,  we  see  that  after  a  sufficiently  long  time  the  charge  on  the  capacitor  approaches 
the value 
 
 
 
At  that  time,  the  voltage  across  the  capacitor  is  equal  to  the  applied  voltage  source  and 
the charging process effectively ends, 
 
 
 
The current that flows in the circuit is equal to the derivative in time of the charge,

The coefficient in front of the exponential is equal to the initial current that flows in the 
circuit when the switch was closed at  t = 0 . The graph of current as a function of time is 
shown in Figure 7.6.4 below:

Figure 7.6.4 Current as a function of time during the charging process 

 

 
 
The  current  in  the  charging  circuit  decreases  exponentially  in  time,  I( t) = I 0 e − t R C .   This 
function  is  often  written  as  I( t) = I 0 e − t τ where τ= RC  is  called  the  time  constant.    The 
SI units ofτ are seconds, as can be seen from the dimensional analysis: 
 

[Ω ] [ F ] = ( [V ] [A ] ) ( [C ] [V ] ) = [C ] [A ] = [C ] ( [C ] [ s ] ) = [ s ]  

 
The  time  constantτ is  a  measure  of  the  decay  time  for  the  exponential  function.    This 
decay rate satisfies the following property: 
 
 
  
which shows that after one time constantτ has elapsed, the current falls off by a factor of 
e −1 = 0.368
, as indicated in Figure 7.6.4 above. Similarly, the voltage across the capacitor 
τ:

7.6.2  Discharging a Capacitor

The  charged  capacitor  is  now  acting  like  a  voltage  source  to  drive  current  around  the 
circuit. When the capacitor discharges (electrons flow from the negative plate through the 
wire  to  the  positive  plate),  the  voltage  across  the  capacitor  decreases.  The  capacitor  is 
losing  strength  as  a  voltage  source. Applying  the Kirchhoff’s  loop  rule  by  traversing  the 
loop counterclockwise, the equation that describes the discharging process is given by 
 
 
 
The  current  that  flows  away  from  the  positive  plate  is  proportional  to  the  charge  on  the 
plate, 
 
 
The negative  sign  in  the  equation  is  an  indication  that  the  rate of  change of  the  charge  is 
proportional to the negative of the charge on the capacitor. This is due to the fact that the 
charge on the positive plate is decreasing as more positive charges leave the positive plate. 
Thus, charge satisfies a first order differential equation: 
 
 
 
This equation can also be integrated by the method of separation of variables

7.8 Problem-Solving Strategy: Applying Kirchhoff’s Rules 
 
In  this  chapter  we  have  seen  how  Kirchhoff ’s  rules  can  be  used  to  analyze  multiloop 
circuits. The steps are summarized below: 
 

 

15

(1) Draw  a  circuit  diagram,  and  label  all  the  quantities,  both  known  and  unknown.  The 
number  of  unknown  quantities  is  equal  to  the  number  of  linearly  independent 
equations we must look for. 

 
(2) Assign  a direction  to  the  current  in  each branch of  the  circuit.  (If  the  actual direction 
is  opposite  to  what  you  have  assumed,  your  result  at  the  end  will  be  a  negative 
number.) 

 
(3) Apply  the  junction  rule  to  all but one of  the  junctions.  (Applying  the  junction  rule  to 
the last junction will not yield any independent relationship among the currents.) 

 
(4) Apply the loop rule to the loops until the number of independent equations obtained is 
the same as  the number of unknowns. For example,  if  there are  three unknowns,  then 
we  must  write  down  three  linearly  independent  equations  in  order  to  have  a  unique 
solution.  

Traverse the loops using the convention below for V∆ :

source 

capacitor 

The  same  equation  is  obtained  whether  the  closed  loop  is  traversed  clockwise  or 
counterclockwise.  (The  expressions  actually  differ  by  an  overall  negative  sign. 
However, using the loop rule, we are led to 0
0= − , and hence the same equation.)  

 
(5)  Solve the simultaneous equations to obtain the solutions for the unknowns. 
 
As  an  example  of  illustrating  how  the  above  procedures  are  executed,  let’s  analyze  the 
circuit shown in Figure 7.8.1.

2R and 
3R are  all  given,  and 
Suppose  the  emf  sources  1ε  and 
2ε ,  and  the  resistances 
we would  like  to  find  the  currents  through  each  resistor, using  the methodology outlined 
above. 
 
(1) The unknown quantities are the three currents  1I ,  2I  and  3I , associated with the three 
resistors. Therefore, to solve the system, we must look for three independent equations.  
 
(2)  The  directions  for  the  three  currents  are  arbitrarily  assigned,  as  indicated  in  Figure 
7.8.2.

(3) Applying Kirchhoff’s current rule to junction b yields 
 
 
 
since 1I and 
2I  are  leaving  the  junction  while 3I  is  entering  the  junction.  The  same 
equation is obtained if we consider junction c. 
 
(4) The other two equations can be obtained by using the loop (voltage) rule, which states 
that  the  net  potential  difference  across  all  elements  in  a  closed  circuit  loop  is  zero. 
Traversing the first loop befcb in the clockwise direction yields

Similarly, traversing the second loop abcda clockwise gives 
 
 
  
Note however, that one may also consider the big loop abefcda. This leads to 
 
 
 
However, the equation is not linearly independent of the other two loop equations since it 
is simply the sum of those equations.  
 
(5)  The  solutions  to  the  above  three  equations  are  given  by,  after  tedious  but 
straightforward algebra,
