RC Circuit 


An uncharged capacitor is connected to a 
dc voltage source via a switch. A resistor 
is placed in series with the capacitor. The 
switch is initially open. At t = 0, the 
switch is closed. A very long time after 
the switch is closed, the current in the 
circuit is 
1. nearly zero 
2. at a maximum and decreasing 
3. nearly constant but non-zero 

RC Circuit 


(1)  After a long time the current is 0


Eventually the capacitor gets “full” – the 
voltage increase provided by the battery 
is equal to the voltage drop across the 
capacitor.  The voltage drop across the 
resistor at this point is 0 – no current is 
flowing.

An uncharged capacitor is connected to a 
dc voltage source via a switch. A resistor 
is placed in series with the capacitor. The 
switch is initially open. At t = 0, the 
switch is closed. Just after the switch is 
closed, the current in the circuit is 

1. zero and increasing 
2. at a maximum and decreasing 
3. constant but non-zero

(2)  at a maximum and decreasing


Initially there is no charge on the 
capacitor and hence no voltage drop 
across it.  All of the potential drop is 
across the resistor – maximum current. 
As charge builds up on the capacitor the 
current will “slow down” – there will be 
a smaller drop across the resistor and 
hence less current.

An uncharged capacitor 
is connected to a dc 
voltage source  in the 
circuit shown. The 
switch is initially open. 
At t = 0, the switch is 
closed. A long time 
after the switch S is 
closed, the current  i3  is 
1)  ε/ 3R

2)  ε/ 2R

A long time after 
the switch S is 
closed, the current 
i3  is 
2)  ε/ 2R 
After a long time the capacitor 
is fully charged and no current 
flows through it.  Then we 
simply have a one loop circuit 
on the left with a total resistance 
of 2R.
