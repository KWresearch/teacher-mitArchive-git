Masses in Potentials


PRS04 

Consider 3 equal masses sitting in 
different gravitational potentials: 
A) Constant, zero potential 
B) Constant, non-zero potential 
C) Linear potential (V ∝ x) but 
sitting at V = 0 

Which statement is true? 
1.  None of the masses will accelerate 

2.  Only B will accelerate 
3.  Only C will accelerate 
4.  All masses will accelerate, but B 
will have the largest acceleration 
5.  All masses will accelerate, but C 
will have the largest acceleration

(3)  	 Only C (in linear potential) will 
accelerate 

When you think about potential, 
think “height.”  For example, near 
the Earth: 

U = mgh  so V = gh 


Constant potential (think constant 
height) thus will not cause 
acceleration.  The value of the 
potential (height) is irrelevant.

Positive Charge 

Place a positive charge in an electric 
field.  It will move from 

1. higher to lower electric potential; 

lower to higher potential energy 

2. higher to lower electric potential; 

higher to lower potential energy

3. lower to higher electric potential; 

lower to higher potential energy

4. lower to higher electric potential; 

higher to lower potential energy

(2)  From higher to lower potential 

and higher to lower potential energy 


Objects always move to reduce their 
potential energy.  Positive charges 
do this by moving towards a lower 
potential: 

U = qV

Negative Charge


Place a negative charge in an 
electric field.  It will move from 

1. higher to lower electric potential; 

lower to higher potential energy 

2. higher to lower electric potential; 

higher to lower potential energy

3. lower to higher electric potential; 

lower to higher potential energy

4. lower to higher electric potential; 

higher to lower potential energy

and higher to lower potential energy

do this by moving towards a higher

Potential and Energy 

Which is true? 
I. 	 It takes positive work to bring 
like charges together. 
II. Electric field lines always point 
in the direction of decreasing 
electric potential. 
III. If a negative charge moves in 
the direction of the electric field, 
its potential energy decreases. 
1. II only. 
2. II and III only. 
3. I, II and III. 
4. I and II only. 
5. I only.

Potential and Energy


(4)  I and II Only 

I. It takes positive work to bring like 
charges together.  TRUE 

II. Electric field lines always point 
in the direction of decreasing 
electric potential.  TRUE 

III. If a negative charge moves in 
the direction of the electric field, its 
electric potential energy decreases. 
FALSE – potential decreases so 
potential energy increases (U = qV) 

Two Point Charges 

PRS04 

The work done in moving a positive 
test charge from infinity to the point 
P midway between two charges of 
magnitude +q and –q: 

+q 

P 

-q

1. is positive. 
2. is negative. 
3. is zero. 
4. can not be determined since not 
enough information is given. 
5. I don’t know

Two Point Charges 

(3)  Work from ∞ to P is zero 


+q 

P 

-q

The potential at ∞ is zero. 
The potential at P is zero because 
equal and opposite potentials are 
superimposed from the two point 
charges (remember:  V is a scalar, 
not a vector) 



Potential Landscape 

PRS04 

If I think of the electric potential as 
a mountain range, then the electric 
field points: 

1) Up the mountain sides 
2) Down the mountain sides 
3) Around the mountain sides 
4) I don’t know

(2)  The electric field points the 
fastest way down the potential 
mountain – in the same way that the 
gravitational field tells you to come 
down
