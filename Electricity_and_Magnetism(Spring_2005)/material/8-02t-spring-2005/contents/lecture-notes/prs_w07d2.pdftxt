Consider field created by two loops of 
current.  Which is true? 
1.  Currents parallel (top bigger); 
loops attracted 
2.  Currents parallel (bottom bigger); 
loops repelled 
4.  Currents anti-parallel (top bigger); 
loops repelled 
3.  Currents anti-parallel (bottom 
bigger); loops attracted 
5.  None of the above

(5) None of the above 

Loops repel Æ 
currents anti-parallel 
Field zero above top loop Æ 
field from bottom stronger Æ 
current in bottom loop bigger 

So:  Currents are anti-parallel 

(bottom bigger); loops repelled

Consider current carrying loop above  

a permanent magnet.  Which is true? 

1.  (A) loop is repelled from magnet  

(B) loop is attracted to the magnet 
2.  (A) loop is attracted to the magnet  

(B) loop is repelled from magnet 
3.  Need more information 
4.  Don’t know

(2) (A) loop is attracted to the magnet  

(B) loop is repelled from magnet 

Look at field configuration: 
(A) Tension in field pulls loop 
down  (Dipoles aligned) 
(B) Pressure in field pushes loop 
up (Dipoles anti-aligned)

Integrating B around the loop 
shown gives us 
1. a positive number 

2. a negative number 

3. zero

Answer:  3.  The total current 
penetrating the loop is zero 
(equal amount in and out) so
