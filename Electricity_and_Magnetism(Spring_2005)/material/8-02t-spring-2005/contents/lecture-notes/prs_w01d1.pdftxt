Math Background 
 
Are you familiar with these concepts 
from vector calculus? 
 

1. I’ve never seen them before, and I 
am not so comfortable with math 
2. I’ve never seen them before, but I 
pick up new math concepts quickly 
3. I’ve seen them before, but 
definitely need some review 
4. I am comfortable with vector 
calculus

Answer:  (4) 
 
The curve above has a slope of 1 at the 
origin, and only (3) or (4) has this 
property.  Moreover, the tangent to 
the curve above has a y-component 
changes sign as x changes and an x-
component that is always positive, so 
the answer must be (4).

The above vector field is created by: 
 
1.  Two sources (equal strength) 
2.  Two sources (top stronger) 
3.  Two sources (bottom stronger) 
4.  Source & Sink (equal strength) 
5.  Source & Sink (top stronger) 
6.  Source & Sink (bottom stronger) 
7.  I don’t know

(3) Two sources, bottom stronger 
 
Both sources because lines leaving one 
don’t enter the other. 
Bottom is stronger because it “pushes” 
further

Here there is an initial downward flow. 
 
1.  The point is a source 
2.  The point is a sink 
3.  I don’t know

(1)  Source

It’s a source, because otherwise the 
downward flow would flow right into 
it. 
 

 
 
 
NOTE:  If the background were 
upward, then it would be just flowing 
right into it, so it would be a sink.

These two circulations are in: 
 
1.  The same direction 
(e.g. both clockwise) 
2.  Opposite directions 
 
(e.g. one clockwise, one ccw) 
3.  I don’t know

(2) Opposite directions

Curlcurl2_320.html) 
 
You can tell by looking in between.  
Both circulations push the flow in the 

PRS01 

 
 
 
same direction, so they must be 
circulating counter to each other.

Look along the positive x-axis.  Along 
this axis the grass seed textures are 
vertical.  This means F has only a y 
component when y is zero and x is 
non-zero.  Only consistent with (2).

Two opposite charges are placed on a 
line as shown below. The charge on the 
right is three times larger than the charge 
on the left.  Other than at infinity, where 
is the electric field zero? 
 

qL

qR

 

 
1. Between the two charges 
2. To the right of the charge on the right 
3. To the left of the charge on the left 
4. The electric field is nowhere zero 
5. Not enough information – need to 
know which charge is positive

 (3) Zero is left of qL.   
 
Between field goes from source to sink.  
On right, field is dominated by qR 
(bigger & closer).  
On left, because qL is weaker, its 
“push” left will somewhere be 
balanced by qR’s “pull” to the right
