Current and Resistance 

 
 
6.1 Electric Current 
 
Electric  currents  are  flows  of  electric  charge.  Suppose  a  collection  of  charges  is moving 
perpendicular to a surface of area A, as shown in Figure 6.1.1. 
 

 
Figure 6.1.1 Charges moving through a cross section. 

 

 
The  electric  current  is  defined  to  be  the  rate  at  which  charges  flow  across  any  cross-
sectional  area.  If  an  amount  of  charge ∆Q  passes  through  a  surface  in  a  time  interval ∆t, 
then the average current 
 is given by

The  SI  unit  of  current  is  the  ampere  (A), with  1  A  =  1  coulomb/sec.    Common  currents 
range  from  mega-amperes  in  lightning  to  nano-amperes  in  your  nerves.  In  the  limit 
the instantaneous current I may be defined as 
t∆ →
0,
 
 
 
Since  flow  has  a  direction, we  have  implicitly  introduced  a  convention  that  the  direction 
of current corresponds to the direction in which positive charges are flowing. The flowing 
charges  inside wires  are negatively  charged  electrons  that move  in  the opposite direction 
of  the  current.  Electric  currents  flow  in  conductors:  solids  (metals,  semiconductors), 
liquids  (electrolytes,  ionized)  and  gases  (ionized),  but  the  flow  is  impeded  in  non-
conductors or insulators. 
 
 
6.1.1 Current Density 
 
To  relate current, a macroscopic quantity,  to  the microscopic motion of  the charges,  let’s 
examine a conductor of cross-sectional area A, as shown in Figure 6.1.2.

 is  the  average  speed  of  the  charge  carriers  inside  a  conductor  when  an 
external electric field is applied.  Actually an electron inside the conductor does not travel 
in a straight line; instead, its path is rather erratic, as shown in Figure 6.1.3.

In many materials,  the  current  density  is  linearly  dependent  on  the  external  electric  field

(microscopic)  Ohm’s  law.  A  material  that  obeys  this  relation  is  said  to  be  ohmic; 
otherwise, the material is non-ohmic.  
 
Comparing Eq. (6.2.1) with Eq. (6.1.10), we see that the conductivity can be expressed as

q∆  is  moved  from  a  through  the  battery,  its  electric  potential  energy  is  increased 
by U
∆ = ∆ ∆ . On  the other hand, as  the charge moves across  the resistor,  the potential 
q V
energy  is decreased due  to collisions with atoms  in  the  resistor.  If we neglect  the  internal 
resistance  of  the  battery  and  the  connecting  wires,  upon  returning  to  a  the  potential 
energy of  q∆  remains unchanged.

6.6 Conceptual Questions

3. 

Two wires A  and  B  of  circular  cross-section  are made  of  the  same metal  and  have 
equal  lengths, but  the  resistance of wire A  is  four  times greater  than  that of wire B.  
Find the ratio of their cross-sectional areas.   

From  the  point  of  view  of  atomic  theory,  explain  why  the  resistance  of  a  material 
increases as its temperature increases. 

Two  conductors  A  and  B  of  the  same  length  and  radius  are  connected  across  the 
same  potential  difference.  The  resistance  of  conductor  A  is  twice  that  of  B.  To 
which conductor is more power delivered?

(b)  What  is  the  resistance  of  the  entire  resistor?  (Hint:  For  the  tapered  portion,  it  is 
necessary  to write down  the  incremental  resistance dR of a  small  slice, dx, of  the  resistor 
at  an  arbitrary  position,  x,  and  then  to  sum  the  slices by  integration.  If  the  taper  is  small, 
one may assume that the current density is uniform across any cross section.)  
 
(c) Show that your answer reduces to the expected expression if a = b.  
 
(d) If L1 = 100 mm, L2 = 50 mm, a = 0.5 mm, b = 1.0 mm, what is the resistance?  
 
 
6.7.4 Current Density and Drift Speed

6.7.5 Current Sheet 
 
A  current  sheet,  as  the  name  implies,  is  a  plane  containing  currents  flowing  in  one 
direction  in  that  plane.    One  way  to  construct  a  sheet  of  current  is  by  running  many 
parallel  wires  in  a  plane,  say  the  yz -plane,  as  shown  in  Figure  6.7.2(a).    Each  of  these 
ˆ− j  direction, with n wires per unit length in 
wires carries current I out of the page, in the 
the  z-direction,  as  shown  in  Figure  6.7.2(b).    Then  the  current  per  unit  length  in  the  z 
direction  is  nI .    We  will  use  the  symbol  K  to  signify  current  per  unit  length,  so  that 
K nl=
 here.   
 

 
Figure 6.7.2 A current sheet. 

 

 
Another way to construct a current sheet is to take a non-conducting sheet of charge with 
fixed  charge  per  unit  area σ  and  move  it  with  some  speed  in  the  direction  you  want 
current  to flow.   For example,  in  the sketch to  the  left, we have a sheet of charge moving 
out of the page with speed  v .  The direction of current flow is out of the page.   
 
(a) Show  that  the magnitude of  the  current per unit  length  in  the  z  direction,  K ,  is  given 
by  vσ . Check  that  this quantity has  the proper dimensions of  current per  length.   This  is 
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
in  fact  a  vector  relation, 
,  since  the  sense  of  the  current  flow  is  in  the  same 
( )tσK = v
(t)
direction as the velocity of the positive charges.

accelerator  at  the  rate  of  2.83  mC/s.    If  the  width  of  the  belt  carrying  the  charge  is 
50 cm
and the belt travels at a speed of  30 m , what is the surface charge density on the 
/s
belt?  [Ans: 189 µC/m2] 
 
 
6.7.6 Resistance and Resistivity 
 
A wire with a resistance of 6.0 Ω is drawn out through a die so that its new length is three 
times  its  original  length.    Find  the  resistance  of  the  longer  wire,  assuming  that  the

6.7.8 Charge Accumulation at the Interface 
 
Figure  6.7.3  shows  a  three-layer  sandwich  made  of  two  resistive  materials  with 
resistivities

of  width

/ 3d
followed by another layer of the first material with resistivity 
1ρ  , again of width 
.   
 

 
Figure 6.7.3 Charge accumulation at interface. 

 

 
The cross-sectional area of all of these materials is A.   The resistive sandwich is bounded 
on  either  side  by  metallic  conductors  (black  regions).    Using  a  battery  (not  shown),  we 
maintain  a  potential  difference  V  across  the  entire  sandwich,  between  the  metallic 
conductors.  The left side of the sandwich is at the higher potential (i.e., the electric fields 
point from left to right).   
 
There  are  four  interfaces  between  the  various  materials  and  the  conductors,  which  we 
label  a  through  d,  as  indicated  on  the  sketch.    A  steady  current  I  flows  through  this
