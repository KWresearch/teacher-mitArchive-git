Coherent, monochromatic plane waves: 


PRS33 

In the Figure above, the fringe at point P 
on the screen will be: 

1.  An interference maximum  

2.  An interference minimum  

3.  Don’t have a clue

Answer:  2.  Interference minimum.  


The two waves arrive at point P exactly 
180 degrees or half a wavelength out of 
phase.

Coherent monochromatic plane waves 
impinge on two apertures separated by a 
distance d.  An approximate formula for 
the path length difference between the 
two rays shown is 
1.  d sinθ 
2.  L sinθ 
3.  d cos θ 
4.  L cos θ 
5.  Don’t have a clue.

Answer: 1.  δ = d sinθ


The difference between the two paths can 
be seen to have this value by geometrical 
construction (using the triangle show in 
yellow). 



Two Slit  Interference:

 A 
B 
In the two 2-slit interference patterns 
above, the frequency of the wave on the 
left (A) is larger or smaller than the 
frequency of the wave on the right (B)? 
The slit spacing d is the same in both 
cases. 

1.  A larger than B 
2.  A smaller than B

3.  Don’t have a clue

              A                                     B 
Answer:  (1)  A smaller than B.  Two ways 
to argue.  The most straightforward is to 
realize that the wavelength in A is longer 
than the wavelength in B, therefore since 
λf=c, the frequency in A must be smaller 
than the frequency in B.  The other way is 
to look at

so the smaller θdestructive in B means smaller 
λ and thus higher frequency.

Answer: 2.

For this angle, the path difference 
between rays 1 and 3 will be exactly half a 
wavelength, and those waves will interfere 
destructively.  This will also be true for 
rays 2 and 4.  Therefore all the rays from 
the slit will interfere destructively when 
the condition above is satisfied.

Coherent monochromatic plane waves 
impinge on two long narrow apertures 
(width a) that are separated by a distance 
d (d >> a).  The resulting pattern on a 
screen far away is shown above.  Which 
structure in the pattern above is due to 
the finite width a of the apertures? 

1.	 The distantly-spaced zeroes of the 
envelope, as indicated by the length A 
above. 
2.	 The closely-spaced zeroes of the 
rapidly varying fringes with length B 
above. 
3.  Don’t have a clue.  




PRS33 

Answer: 1.  The distantly-spaced zeroes of 
the envelope are determined by the width 
a << d of the apertures, which is much 
smaller than the separation d of the 
apertures.  The much larger distance d 
determines the “fine-scale” structure in 
the graph above.

Coherent monochromatic plane waves 
impinge on two long narrow (width a) 
apertures separated by a distance d.  The 
resulting pattern on a screen far away is 
shown above.  For this arrangement: 

1.  The value of d/a is about 1/8 

2.  The value of d/a is about 1/4 

3.  The value of d/a is about 4 
4.  The value of d/a is about 8 
5.  Don’t have a clue. 



PRS33 

Answer: 4.  The value of d/a is about 8.  


d determines spacing of the “fine-scale” 
zeroes (spacing proportional to 1/d).  a 
determines spacing of envelope zeroes 
(spacing proportional to 1/a).  So there 
are d/a fine-scale zeroes in the rapid 
fluctuations before we get to the first zero 
in the envelope.  Here there are 8.
