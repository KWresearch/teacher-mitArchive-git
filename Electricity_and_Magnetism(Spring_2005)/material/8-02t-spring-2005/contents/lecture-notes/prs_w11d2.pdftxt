PRS26 

The plot shows the driving voltage V 
(black curve) and the current I (red 
curve) in a driven RLC circuit.  In 
this circuit, 

1.  The current leads the voltage 


2.  The current lags the voltage 


3.  Don’t have a clue 



PRS26 

Answer:  2. The current lags the 

voltage. 


The current peaks after the voltage 
peaks

The graph shows the current versus 

the voltage in a driven RLC circuit at 

a given driving frequency. In this plot 

1. The current leads the voltage by 
about 45 degrees. 
2. The current lags the voltage by 

about 45 degrees 

3. The current and the voltage are in 
phase 
4. Don’t have a clue.  




PRS26 

Answer:  3.  They are in phase.  


The current and the voltage reach a 
peak at exactly the same time, so they 
are exactly in phase. 



PRS26 

The graph shows the current versus 

the voltage in a driven RLC circuit at 

a given driving frequency. In this plot 

1. Current lags voltage by ~90º 

2. Current leads voltage by ~90º 

3. Current and voltage are almost in 
phase 
4. We don’t have enough information 
to say whether the current leads or 
lags (but they aren’t in phase!) 



PRS26 

Answer:  1.  Current lags. 


Based on the direction in which the 
above loop is traced out, we see that 
the voltage peaks first, then the 
current, and so forth.  The current 
lags.

The graph shows the current versus 
the voltage in a driven RLC circuit at 
a particular driving frequency. At this 
frequency, the circuit is dominated by 
its 
1. Resistance 
2. Inductance 
3. Capacitance 
4. Don’t have a clue  




PRS26 

Answer: 3.  Capacitance 


The current leads the voltage, which is 
characteristic of an RLC circuit at a 
frequency dominated by its 
capacitance (1/ωC > ωL). 



PRS26 

The graph shows the current versus 
the voltage in a driven RLC circuit at 
a particular driving frequency. Is this 
frequency above or below the 
resonance frequency of the circuit? 

1. Above the resonance frequency  

2. Below the resonance frequency  

3. Don’t have a clue 



PRS26 

Answer: 1.  Above the resonance  

frequency  


The current lags the voltage.  This 
means that ωL > 1/ωC .  Thus the 
frequency satisfies ω2  > 1/LC
