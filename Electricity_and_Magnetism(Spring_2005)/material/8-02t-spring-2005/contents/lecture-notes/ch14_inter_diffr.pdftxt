14.1  Superposition of Waves 
 
Consider  a  region  in  space  where  two  or  more  waves  pass  through  at  the  same  time. 
According  to  the  superposition  principle,  the  net  displacement  is  simply  given  by  the 
vector  or  the  algebraic  sum  of  the  individual  displacements.  Interference  is  the 
combination  of  two  or  more  waves  to  form  a  composite  wave,  based  on  such  principle. 
The idea of the superposition principle is illustrated in Figure 14.1.1.

In order to form an interference pattern, the incident light must satisfy two conditions: 
 
(i) The light sources must be coherent. This means that the plane waves from the sources 
must maintain a constant phase relation. For example, if two waves are completely out of 
phase with φ π= , this phase difference must not change with time.  
 
(ii)  The  light  must  be  monochromatic.  This  means  that  the  light  consists  of  just  one 
2 / k
wavelength 
.  
λ π=
 
Light  emitted  from  an  incandescent  lightbulb  is  incoherent  because  the  light  consists  o 
waves  of  different  wavelengths  and  they  do  not  maintain  a  constant  phase  relationship. 
Thus, no interference pattern is observed.

14.2   Young’s Double-Slit Experiment 
 
In 1801 Thomas Young  carried out  an  experiment  in which  the wave nature of  light was 
demonstrated.  The  schematic  diagram  of  the  double-slit  experiment  is  shown  in  Figure 
14.2.1. 
 

 
Figure 14.2.1 Young’s double-slit experiment. 

 

  
A monochromatic light source is incident on the first screen which contains a slit 
0S
. The 
emerging  light  then  arrives  at  the  second  screen  which  has  two  parallel  slits  S
1  and  S2. 

 

3

which serve as the sources of coherent light. The light waves emerging from the two slits 
then  interfere  and  form  an  interference  pattern  on  the  viewing  screen.  The  bright  bands 
(fringes)  correspond  to  interference  maxima,  and  the  dark  band  interference  minima. 
Figure  14.2.2  shows  the  ways  in  which  the  waves  could  combine  to  interfere 
constructively or destructively.  
  

 
 
 
Figure  14.2.2  Constructive  interference  (a)  at  P,  and  (b)  at  P1.  (c)  Destructive 
interference at P2.  
 
The geometry of the double-slit interference is shown in the Figure 14.2.3.

Consider  light  that  falls  on  the  screen  at  a  point  P  a  distance

are separated by a distance d. The  light from slit 2 will  travel an extra distance

14.4  Diffraction 
 
In addition to interference, waves also exhibit another property – diffraction, which is the 
bending of waves as  they pass by  some objects or  through an aperture. The phenomenon 
of diffraction can be understood using Huygens’s principle which states that  
 
Every unobstructed point on a wavefront will act a source of secondary spherical waves. 
The new wavefront is the surface tangent to all the secondary spherical waves.  
 
Figure 14.4.1 illustrates the propagation of the wave based on Huygens’s principle.  
 

 
Figure 14.4.1 Propagation of wave based on Huygens’s principle. 

 
According  to  Huygens’s  principle,  light  waves  incident  on  two  slits  will  spread  out  and 
exhibit an interference pattern in the region beyond (Figure 14.4.2a). The pattern is called 
a diffraction pattern. On the other hand, if no bending occurs and the light wave continue 
to travel in straight lines, then no diffraction pattern would be observed (Figure 14.4.2b). 
 

 

 

 

 

 
Figure  14.4.2  (a)  Spreading  of  light  leading  to  a  diffraction  pattern.  (b)    Absence  of 
diffraction pattern if the paths of the light wave are straight lines. 
 
We  shall  restrict  ourselves  to  a  special  case  of  diffraction  called  the  Fraunhofer 
diffraction.  In this case, all light rays that emerge from the slit are approximately parallel 
to  each  other.  For  a  diffraction  pattern  to  appear  on  the  screen,  a  convex  lens  is  placed 
between the slit and screen to provide convergence of the light rays.   
 
 
14.5  Single-Slit Diffraction 
 
In our  consideration of  the Young’s double-slit experiments, we have  assumed  the width 
of  the  slits  to be  so  small  that  each  slit  is  a point  source.  In  this  section we  shall  take  the 
width of slit to be finite and see how Fraunhofer diffraction arises. 

 

12

 
Let  a  source  of  monochromatic  light  be  incident  on  a  slit  of  finite  width  a,  as  shown  in 
Figure 14.5.1.

Figure 14.5.1 Diffraction of light by a slit of width a. 
 
In  diffraction  of  Fraunhofer  type,  all  rays  passing  through  the  slit  are  approximately 
parallel.  In addition, each portion of  the  slit will act as a  source of  light waves according 
to  Huygens’s  principle.  For  simplicity  we  divide  the  slit  into  two  halves.  At  the  first 
minimum,  each  ray  from  the  upper  half  will  be  exactly  180 out  of  phase  with  a 
°
corresponding ray form the lower half. For example, suppose there are 100 point sources, 
with the first 50 in the lower half, and 51 to 100 in the upper half. Source 1 and source 51

/ 2
are  separated  by  a  distance 
and  are  out  of  phase  with  a  path  difference

Similar  observation  applies  to  source  2  and  source  52,  as  well  as  any  pair  that  are  a

Figure 14.5.2 Intensity distribution for a single-slit diffraction. 
 
By  comparing  Eq.  (14.5.4)  with  Eq.  (14.2.5),  we  see  that  the  condition  for  minima  of  a 
single-slit  diffraction  becomes  the  condition  for  maxima  of  a  double-slit  interference 
when the width of a single slit a is replaced by the separation between the two slits d. The 
reason  is  that  in  the  double-slit  case,  the  slits  are  taken  to  be  so  small  that  each  one  is 
considered  as  a  single  light  source,  and  the  interference  of  waves  originating  within  the 
same  slit  can  be  neglected. On  the  other  hand,  the minimum  condition  for  the  single-slit 
diffraction  is  obtained  precisely  by  taking  into  consideration  the  interference  of  waves 
that originate within the same slit.   
 
 
Example 14.3: Single-Slit Diffraction 
 
A  monochromatic  light  with  a  wavelength  of λ =  600  nm  passes  through  a  single  slit 
which has a width of 0.800 mm. 
 
(a) What is the distance between the slit and the screen be located if the first minimum in 
the diffraction pattern is at a distance 1.00 mm from the center of the screen?

14.6  Intensity of Single-Slit Diffraction 
 
How  do  we  determine  the  intensity  distribution  for  the  pattern  produced  by  a  single-slit 
diffraction?  To  calculate  this,  we  must  find  the  total  electric  field  by  adding  the  field 
contributions from each point.  
 
Let’s  divide  the  single  slit  into  N  small  zones  each  of  width 
,  as  shown  in 
y
a N
/
∆ =
Figure 14.6.1. The convex lens is used to bring parallel light rays to a focal point P on the 
screen. We  shall  assume  that  y λ∆ (cid:19) so  that  all  the  light  from  a  given  zone  is  in  phase.

If we  assume  that  the  incident  light  is  planar  and  diffraction  spreads  the  light  from  each 
slit over a wide angle so that the light from all the slits will interfere with each other. The 
sindδ
relative  path  difference  between  each  pair  of  adjacent  slits  is 
,  similar  to  the 
θ
=
calculation we made for the double-slit case. If this path difference is equal to an integral 
multiple of wavelengths then all the slits will constructively interfere with each other and 
a bright spot will appear on the screen at an angle θ. Thus, the condition for the principal 
maxima is given by 
 
 
 
If  the  wavelength  of  the  light  and  the  location  of  the  m-order  maximum  are  known,  the 
d
distance 
 between slits may be readily deduced.  
 
The  location  of  the  maxima  does  not  depend  on  the  number  of  slits,  N.  However,  the 
maxima  become  sharper  and  more  intense  as  N  is  increased.  The  width  of  the  maxima 
can  be  shown  to  be  inversely  proportional  to  N.  In  Figure  14.8.2,  we  show  the  intensity

The  observation  can  be  explained  as  follows:  suppose  an  angle  θ  (  recall  that 
λ)  which  initially  gives  a  principal  maximum  is  increased  slightly,  if

there  were  only  two  slits,  then  the  two  waves  will  still  be  nearly  in  phase  and  produce 
maxima which  are  broad. However,  in  grating with  a  large  number  of  slits,  even  though 
θ may  only  be  slightly  deviated  from  the  value  that  produces  a  maximum,  it  could  be 
exactly  out  of  phase  with  light  wave  from  another  slit  far  away.  Since  grating  produces 
peaks  that  are  much  sharper  than  the  two-slit  system,  it  gives  a  more  precise 
measurement of the wavelength.

14.10  Appendix: Computing the Total Electric Field  
 
 Section  14.6  we  used  a  trigonometric  relation  and  obtained  the  total  electric  field  for  a 
single-slit  diffraction.    Below  we  show  two  alternative  approaches  of  how  Eq.  (14.6.5) 
can be simplified. 
 
(1) Complex representation:  
 
The total field  E  may be regarded as a geometric series. From the Euler formula

(2) Phasor diagram: 
 
Alternatively, we may also use phasor diagrams to obtain the time-independent portion of 
the  resultant  field.  Before  doing  this,  let’s  first  see  how  phasor  addition  works  for  two 
wave functions.

The  idea  of  this  geometric  approach  is  based  on  the  fact  that  when  adding  two  vectors, 
the  component  of  the  resultant  vector  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  the  individual  components.

14.11.5   Second-Order Bright Fringe 
 
A  monochromatic  light  is  incident  on  a  single  slit  of  width  0.800  mm,  and  a  diffraction 
pattern  is  formed  at  a  screen  which  is  0.800  m  away  from  the  slit.  The  second-order 
bright  fringe  is  at  a  distance  1.60  mm  from  the  center  of  the  central  maximum. What  is 
the wavelength of the incident light? 
 
Solution: 
 
The general condition for destructive interference is 
 
 
 
where  small-angle  approximation  has  been  made.  Thus,  the  position  of  the  m-th  order 
dark fringe measured from the central axis is 
 
 
 
Let  the  second  bright  fringe  be  located  halfway  between  the  second  and  the  third  dark 
fringes. That is,

14.12  Conceptual Questions 
 
1. In Young’s double-slit experiment, what happens to the spacing between the fringes if 
 
(a) the slit separation is increased? 
(b) the wavelength of the incident light is decreased? 
(c) if the distance between the slits and the viewing screen is increased? 
 
2. In Young’s double-slit experiment, how would the interference pattern change if white 
light is used? 
 
3.  Explain  why  the  light  from  the  two  headlights  of  a  distant  car  does  not  produce  an 
interference pattern. 
  
4. What happens to the width of the central maximum in a single-slit diffraction if the slit 
width is increased? 
 
5.  In  a  single-slit  diffraction,  what  happens  to  the  intensity  pattern  if  the  slit  width 
becomes narrower and narrower? 
 
6. In calculating the intensity in double-slit interference, can we simply add the intensities 
from each of the two slits?
