This is also how we know that 
light is a wave phenomena

Interference:  The difference 
between waves and bullets 

No Interference:
if light were made
up of bullets

Interference:  If light is 
a wave we see spreading 
and addition and subtraction

Interference
Interference: Combination of two or more waves to 
form composite wave – use superposition principle.
Waves can add constructively or destructively

Conditions for interference:
1. Coherence: the sources must maintain a 
constant phase with respect to each other
2. Monochromaticity: the sources consist of 
waves of a single wavelength

What can introduce a phase shift?

1. From different, out of phase sources
2. Sources in phase, but travel different 
distances

λ is smaller by 10,000 times.
But d can be smaller (0.1 mm instead of 0.24 m)
So y will only be 10 times smaller – still measurable

Two Slits With Finite Width a
With more than one slit having finite width a, we must consider
1. Diffraction due to the individual slit
Interference of waves from different slits

Babinet’s Principle
Case I:  Put in a slit, get diffraction
Case II:  Fill up slit, get nothing
Case III:  Remove slit, get diffraction

By superposition, the E field with the slit and the E 
field with just the filling must be exact opposites in 
order to cancel: E
E= −

I

So the intensities are identical:

Use known width a and zeroes ydestructive to 
Estimate wavelength of red light
2. Human Hair (Babinet says just single slit).  
Use λred (from 1) and zeroes ydestructive to 
Estimate thickness of hair
3. Double Slit – 4 different slits.  
Use known spacing d and zeroes to 
Estimate wavelength of red light
