The curve above has a slope of 1 at the 
origin, and only (3) or (4) has this 
property.  Moreover, the tangent to 
the curve above has a y-component 
changes sign as x changes and an x-
component that is always positive, so 
the answer must be (4).

The above vector field is created by: 

1. Two sources (equal strength) 
2. Two sources (top stronger) 
3. Two sources (bottom stronger) 
4. Source & Sink (equal strength) 
5. Source & Sink (top stronger) 
6. Source & Sink (bottom stronger) 
7. I don’t know 

PRS01

(3) Two sources, bottom stronger 

Both sources because lines leaving one 
don’t enter the other. 
Bottom is stronger because it “pushes” 
further

PRS01

Here there is an initial downward flow. 

1. The point is a source 
2. The point is a sink

It’s a source, because otherwise the 
downward flow would flow right into 
it.

PRS01

NOTE:  If the background were 
upward, then it would be just flowing 
right into it, so it would be a sink.

Look along the positive x-axis.  Along

Two opposite charges are placed on a 
line as shown below. The charge on the 
right is three times larger than the charge 
on the left.  Other than at infinity, where 
is the electric field zero?

qR

1. Between the two charges 
2. To the right of the charge on the right 
3. To the left of the charge on the left 
4. The electric field is nowhere zero 
5. Not enough information – need to 
know which charge is positive

PRS01

qR

 (3) Zero is left of qL.

Between field goes from source to sink.
On right, field is dominated by qR
(bigger & closer).
On left, because qL is weaker, its 
“push” left will somewhere be 
balanced by qR’s “pull” to the right 

Electric field lines in the space 
surrounding a charge distribution show: 

PRS01

1. Directions of the forces that exist in 
space at all times. 
2. Only directions in which static charges 
would accelerate when at points on 
those lines 
3. Only directions in which moving 
charges would accelerate when at 
points on those lines. 
4. Directions in which either static or 
moving charges would accelerate 
when passing through points on those 
lines.
5. Paths static or moving charges would 
take.

(4) Direction of acceleration of charges 
either “in” or “moving through” 

PRS01

NOTE:  This is different than flow 
lines (5).  Particles do NOT move along 
field lines. 

PRS01

The force between the two charges is: 
1) Attractive 
2) Repulsive 
3) Can’t tell without more information

PRS01

(2)  Repulsive 

One way to tell is to notice that they 
both must be sources (or sinks).
Hence, as like particles repel, the force 
is repulsive. 

You can also see this as tension in the 
field lines

The electric field at the center is due to 
two pairs of charges across the diagonal 
and the unpaired top charge.  The electric 
fields of the two pairs of charge will 
cancel at the center by symmetry.
Therefore the electric field at the center 
is due only to the top charge.  The 
distance to the top charge is R, and the 
field points downward.

E-Field of a Dipole

As you move to large distances r
away from a dipole, the electric 
field will fall-off as: 
1) 1/r2, just like a point charge 
2) More rapidly than 1/r2
3) More slowly than 1/r2
4) Who knows?

PRS01

E-Field of a Dipole

(2)  It falls off more rapidly 

We know this must be a case by 
thinking about what a dipole looks like 
from a large distance.  To first order, it 
isn’t there (net charge is 0), so the E-
Field must decrease faster. 

PRS01

An electric dipole, consisting of two 
equal and opposite point charges at the 
ends of an insulating rod, is free to rotate 
about a pivot point in the center.  The rod 
is placed in a non-uniform electric field.

The dipole will experience
1. a noticeable electric force and no 
noticeable electric torque 
2. no noticeable electric force and a 
noticeable electric torque 
3. a noticeable electric force and a 
noticeable electric torque 
4. no noticeable electric force and no 
noticeable electric torque 

PRS01

(3)  A noticeable force and torque 

Because the field is non-uniform, the 
force on the two equal but opposite 
point charges do not cancel. 

As always, the dipole will rotate to 
align with the field, hence there must 
be a torque on the dipole as well 

PRS01

Masses in Potentials

Consider 3 equal masses sitting in 
different gravitational potentials: 
A) Constant, zero potential 
B) Constant, non-zero potential 
C) Linear potential (V (cid:118) x) but 
sitting at V = 0 

Which statement is true?
1.  None of the masses will accelerate 
2.  Only B will accelerate 
3.  Only C will accelerate 
4.  All masses will accelerate, but B 
will have the largest acceleration 
5.  All masses will accelerate, but C 
will have the largest acceleration 

Masses in Potentials

PRS01

(3)  Only C (in linear potential) will 
accelerate

When you think about potential, 
think “height.”  For example, near 
the Earth:   

U = mgh  so V = gh 

Constant potential (think constant 
height) thus will not cause 
acceleration.  The value of the 
potential (height) is irrelevant. 

PRS01

Positive Charge

Place a positive charge in an electric 
field.  It will move from 

1. higher to lower electric potential;
lower to higher potential energy 

2. higher to lower electric potential;
higher to lower potential energy

3. lower to higher electric potential;
lower to higher potential energy

4. lower to higher electric potential;
higher to lower potential energy

Positive Charge

PRS01

(2)  From higher to lower potential 
and higher to lower potential energy 

Objects always move to reduce their 
potential energy.  Positive charges 
do this by moving towards a lower 
potential:

U = qV

PRS01

Negative Charge

Place a negative charge in an 
electric field.  It will move from 

1. higher to lower electric potential;
lower to higher potential energy 

2. higher to lower electric potential;
higher to lower potential energy

3. lower to higher electric potential;
lower to higher potential energy

4. lower to higher electric potential;

Which is true? 
I.   It takes positive work to bring 
like charges together. 
II. Electric field lines always point

electric potential. 
III. If a negative charge moves in 
the direction of the electric field, 
its potential energy decreases. 
1. II only. 
2. II and III only. 
3. I, II and III. 
4. I and II only. 
5. I only.

(4)  I and II Only 

I. It takes positive work to bring like

II. Electric field lines always point 
in the direction of decreasing 
electric potential.  TRUE 

III. If a negative charge moves in 
the direction of the electric field, its 
electric potential energy decreases. 
FALSE – potential decreases so 
potential energy increases (U = qV)

(3)  Work from (cid:102) to P is zero

The potential at (cid:102) is zero. 
The potential at P is zero because 
equal and opposite potentials are 
superimposed from the two point 
charges (remember:  V is a scalar, 
not a vector) 

PRS01

8. C, D, E, F only

Should We Use Gauss’ Law?

PRS01

(5)  A, D, E & F 

In order to effectively use Gauss’ 
law, the charge distribution must 
have either spherical, cylindrical or 
planar symmetry. 

(cid:120) Concentric spheres have spherical 
symmetry, non-concentric do not 
(cid:120) Infinite lines have cylindrical 
symmetry, finite do not 
(cid:120) Infinite planes and slabs of charge 
both exhibit planar symmetry

Spherical Shell

charge the electric field grows 
linearly with distance.
Inside the charged 
spherical shell at left 
(r<a) what does the 
electric field do?

Q

1. Constant and Zero 
2. Constant but Non-Zero 
3.  Still grows linearly
4. Some other functional form
(use Gauss’ Law to determine) 
5. Can’t determine with Gauss Law

PRS01

Spherical Shell

1.  Constant and Zero 

We have spherical symmetry so we 
can use Gauss’ Law with a spherical 
surface.  Any surface inside the 
spherical shell will contain no 
charge and hence have no flux 
through it.  E = 0!

As you move away from the center, 
an imbalance is generated in the 
amount of charge below you and the 
amount above you.  This imbalance 
grows linearly with z, and is what 
leads to the E field that you see. 

Once outside the slab, the 
imbalance stops changing so the 
field is constant.

With no battery connected to the

As d increases, V increases.

Since the electric field is

Suppose the plates are pulled apart

How does the final electrostatic 
energy stored in the capacitor 
compare to the initial energy?

(2)  The stored energy increases 

As you pull apart the capacitor 
plates you are increasing the 
amount of space in which the E

the stored energy.  Where does the 
extra energy come from?  From the 
work you do pulling the plates 
apart.

1. Q(I1) = Q(I2) = -Q;
Q(O1) = Q(O2)= +Q 

2. Q(I1) = Q(I2) = +Q;
Q(O1) = Q(O2)= -Q 

3. Q(I1) = -Q;  Q(O1) = +Q 
Q(I2) = Q(O2)= 0 

4. Q(I1) = -Q;  Q(O2)= +Q 
Q(O1) = Q(I2)= 0

Hollow Conductors

(1)  The inner faces are negative, 
the outer faces are positive. 

Looking in from each conductor, 
the total charge must be zero (this 
gives the inner surfaces as –Q).  But 
the conductors must remain neutral 
(which makes the outer surfaces 
have induced charge +Q).

A point charge +Q is

is used to connect the 
two conductors, then 
positive charge will flow

1. From the inner to the outer conductor

2. From the outer to the inner conductor 

3. Not at all

Hollow Conductors

(1)  Positive charge flows outward 

Positive charges always flow “downhill” 
– from high to low potential.  Since the 
inner conductor is at a higher potential 
the charges will flow from the inner to 
the outer conductor.

Capacitor Circuit

Three  identical capacitors are connected 
to a battery as pictured. 
The battery is then 
disconnected.
How do the charge on 
A, B & C compare 
before and after the 
battery is removed?

  BEFORE;    AFTER 
1.  QA = QB = QC;  No Change
2.  QA = QB = QC;  QA > QB = QC
3.  QA = QB = QC;  QA < QB = QC
4.  QA > QB = QC;  No Change
5.  QA > QB = QC;  QA = QB = QC
6.  QA < QB = QC;  No Change
7.  QA < QB = QC;  QA = QB = QC

The potential drop across A is the same 
as the sum of the potential drops across B 
& C.  By symmetry VB=VC, so

VA > VB=VC

Since Q = CV, QA > QB = QC.  When the 
battery is disconnected there is no reason 
for the potential to change or charge to 
flow so it doesn’t.

A parallel plate capacitor is charged to a 
total charge Q and the battery removed.
A slab of material with dielectric 
constant (cid:78) in inserted between the plates.

2.  Decreases 
3.  Stays the Same

Since the capacitor is disconnected 
from a battery there is no way for 
the amount of charge on it to 
change.

The dielectric reduces the electric

of energy stored in the field.

The force on the dielectric

(1) The dielectric is pulled into the 
capacitor

We just saw that the energy is 
reduced by the introduction of a 
dielectric.  Since systems want to 
reduce their energy, the dielectric 
will be sucked into the capacitor. 

Alternatively, since opposing 
charges are induced on the 
dielectric surfaces close to the 
plates, the attraction between these 
will lead to the attractive force.
