 Action at a Distance versus Field Theory 

 
 
1.1 
 

“…  In  order  therefore  to  appreciate  the  requirements  of  the  science  [of 
electromagnetism],  the  student  must  make  himself  familiar  with  a 
considerable  body  of  most  intricate  mathematics,  the  mere  retention  of 
which in the memory materially interferes with further progress …” 
 

James Clerk Maxwell [1855] 

 

 
Classical  electromagnetic  field  theory  emerged  in more or  less  complete  form  in 1873  in 
James  Clerk  Maxwell’s  A  Treatise  on  Electricity  and  Magnetism.    Maxwell  based  his 
theory in large part on the intuitive insights of Michael Faraday.  The wide acceptance of 
Maxwell’s theory has caused a fundamental shift in our understanding of physical reality.  
In  this  theory,  electromagnetic  fields  are  the  mediators  of  the  interaction  between 
material  objects.    This  view  differs  radically  from  the  older  “action  at  a  distance”  view 
that preceded field theory.    
 
What is “action at a distance?”  It is a worldview in which the interaction of two material 
objects  requires  no  mechanism  other  than  the  objects  themselves  and  the  empty  space 
between  them.    That  is,  two  objects  exert  a  force  on  each  other  simply  because  they  are 
present.  Any mutual force between them (for example, gravitational attraction or electric 
repulsion)  is  instantaneously  transmitted  from  one  object  to  the  other  through  empty 
space.   There  is no need  to  take  into account any method or agent of  transmission of  that 
force, or any finite speed for the propagation of that agent of transmission.  This is known 
as  “action  at  a  distance”  because  objects  exert  forces  on  one  another  (“action”)  with 
nothing  but  empty  space  (“distance”)  between  them.    No  other  agent  or  mechanism  is 
needed. 
 
Many  natural  philosophers  objected  to  the  “action  at  a  distance”  model  because  in  our 
everyday  experience,  forces  are  exerted  by  one  object  on  another  only  when  the  objects 
are  in direct contact.    In  the  field  theory view,  this  is always  true  in some sense.   That  is, 
objects  that  are  not  in  direct  contact  (objects  separated  by  apparently  empty  space) must 
exert  a  force  on  one  another  through  the  presence  of  an  intervening  medium  or 
mechanism existing in the space between the objects.   
 
The  force between  the  two objects  is  transmitted by direct “contact”  from  the  first object 
to  an  intervening  mechanism  immediately  surrounding  that  object,  and  then  from  one 
element  of  space  to  a  neighboring  element,  in  a  continuous  manner,  until  the  force  is 
transmitted  to  the  region of  space contiguous  to  the  second object, and  thus ultimately  to 
the second object itself.   
 

 

1

Although  the  two  objects  are  not  in  direct  contact  with  one  another,  they  are  in  direct 
contact  with  a  medium  or  mechanism  that  exists  between  them.    The  force  between  the 
objects  is  transmitted  (at  a  finite  speed)  by  stresses  induced  in  the  intervening  space  by 
the presence of the objects.  The “field theory” view thus avoids the concept of “action at 
a  distance”  and  replaces  it  by  the  concept  of  “action  by  continuous  contact.”  The 
“contact”  is provided by  a  stress, or  “field,”  induced  in  the  space  between  the  objects  by 
their presence.   
 
This  is  the  essence  of  field  theory,  and  is  the  foundation  of  all  modern  approaches  to 
understanding the world around us.  Classical electromagnetism was the first field theory.  
It  involves many  concepts  that  are mathematically  complex.    As  a  result,  even  now  it  is 
difficult to appreciate.  In this first chapter of your introduction to field theory, we discuss 
what a field is, and how we represent fields. We begin with scalar fields.   
 
 
1.2  Scalar Fields 
 
A scalar field is a function that gives us a single value of some variable for every point in 
space.  As  an  example,  the  image  in  Figure  1.2.1  shows  the  nighttime  temperatures 
measured  by  the  Thermal  Emission  Spectrometer  instrument  on  the  Mars  Global 
Surveyor (MGS). The data were acquired during the first 500 orbits of the MGS mapping 
mission.  The  coldest  temperatures,  shown  in  purple,  are  1 2 0
° C  while  the  warmest, 
−
6 5−
C. 
shown in white, are 
°
 
The  view  is  centered  on  Isidis  Planitia  (15N,  270W),  which  is  covered  with  warm 
material,  indicating  a  sandy  and  rocky  surface.  The  small,  cold  (blue)  circular  region  to 
the  right  is  the  area  of  the  Elysium  volcanoes,  which  are  covered  in  dust  that  cools  off 
rapidly  at  night. At  this  season  the  north  polar  region  is  in  full  sunlight  and  is  relatively 
warm at night. It is winter in the southern hemisphere and the temperatures are extremely 
low. 

 

 

Figure 1.2.1 Nighttime temperature map for Mars 

 
The  various  colors  on  the map  represent  the  surface  temperature.  This map,  however,  is 
limited  to  representing  only  the  temperature  on  a  two-dimensional  surface  and  thus,  it 
does  not  show  how  temperature  varies  as  a  function  of  altitude.      In  principal,  a  scalar 

 

2

field  provides  values  not  only  on  a  two-dimensional  surface  in  space  but  for  every  point 
in space.   
 
Figure  1.2.2  illustrates  the  variation  of  temperature  as  a  function  of  height  above  the 
surface  of  the Earth, which  is  a  third  dimension which  complements  the  two  dimensions 
shown in Figure 1.2.1.   
 

 

 
Figure  1.2.2  Atmospheric  temperature  variation  as  a  function  of  altitude  above  the 
Earth’s surface 
 
How  do  we  represent  three-dimensional  scalar  fields?    In  principle,  one  could  create  a 
three-dimensional  atmospheric  volume  element  and  color  it  to  represent  the  temperature 
variation.  

 

 

Figure 1.2.3 Spherical coordinates 

 
Another way is to simply represent the temperature variation by a mathematical function. 
For  the  Earth  we  shall  use  spherical  coordinates  (r,θ,φ)  shown  in  Figure  1.2.3  with  the 
origin  chosen  to  coincide  with  the  center  of  the  Earth.  The  temperature  at  any  point  is 
characterized  by  a  function 
.  In  other  words,  the  value  of  this  function  at  the 
,( φθrT
,
)
point  with  coordinates  (r,θ,φ)  is  a  temperature  with  given  units.  The  temperature 
T r θφ  is  an  example  of  a  “scalar  field.”  The  term  “scalar”  implies  that 
function 
( ,
,
)
temperature  at  any  point  is  a  number  rather  than  a  vector  (a  vector  has  both  magnitude 
and direction).

Example 1.1: Half-Frozen /Half-Baked Planet 
 
As an example of a scalar field, consider a planet with an atmosphere that rotates with the  
same  angular  frequency  about  its  axis  as  the  planet  orbits  about  a  nearby  star,  i.e.,  one 
hemisphere  always  faces  the  star.  Let    R  denote  the  radius  of  the  planet.  Use  spherical 
coordinates  (r,θ,φ)  with the origin at the center of the planet, and choose 
2φ π=
 for the 
center of the hemisphere facing the star.  A simplistic model for the temperature variation 
at any point is given by 
 
 
 
2T
1T
0T
where 
, 
α are  constants.  The  dependence  on  the  variable  r  in  the  term 
,  and 
, 
 indicates  that  the  temperature decreases  exponentially  as we move  radially  away 
e α−
( r R
− )
from  the  surface  of  the  planet.  The  dependence  on  the  variable 
θ in  the  term 
sin θ 
2
implies  that  the  temperature  decreases  as  we  move  toward  the  poles.  Finally,  the φ 
 indicates  that  the  temperature  decreases  as  we  move 
dependence  in  the  term  (1 sin )φ+
away from the center of the hemisphere facing the star. 
 
A  scalar  field  can  also  be  used  to  describe  other  physical  quantities  such  as  the 
atmospheric  pressure.  However,  a  single  number  (magnitude)  at  every  point  in  space  is 
not  sufficient  to  characterize  quantities  such  as  the  wind  velocity  since  a  direction  at 
every point in space is needed as well.

1.2.1  Representations of a Scalar Field 
 
A field, as stated earlier, is a function that has a different value at every point in space.  A 
scalar  field  is  a  field  for  which  there  is  a  single  number  associated  with  every  point  in 
space. We  have  seen  that  the  temperature  of  the  Earth’s  atmosphere  at  the  surface  is  an 
example of a scalar field.  Another example is

This expression defines the value of the scalar function φ at every point ( ,

, )
How  do  visually  represent  a  scalar  field  defined  by  an  equation  such  as  Eq.  (1.2.2)?  
Below we discuss three possible representations. 
 
1. Contour Maps 
 
One  way  is  to  fix  one  of  our  independent  variables  (z,  for  example)  and  then  show  a 
contour  map  for  the  two  remaining  dimensions,  in  which  the  curves  represent  lines  of 
constant values  of  the  function φ.   A  series of  these maps  for various  (fixed) values of  z

then  will  give  a  feel  for  the  properties  of  the  scalar  function.    We  show  such  a  contour 
map in the xy-plane at z = 0 for Eq. (1.2.2), namely,

2. Color-Coding 
 
Another  way  we  can  represent  the  values  of  the  scalar  field  is  by  color-coding  in  two 
dimensions  for  a  fixed  value  of  the  third.  This  was  the  scheme  used  for  illustrating  the 
temperature  fields  in  Figures  1.2.1  and  1.2.2.  In  Figure  1.2.5  a  similar map  is  shown  for 
the  scalar  field

3. Relief Maps 
 
A  third  way  to  represent  a  scalar  field  is  to  fix  one  of  the  dimensions,  and  then  plot  the 
value  of  the  function  as  a  height  versus  the  remaining  spatial  coordinates,  say  x  and  y, 
that is, as a relief map.  Figure 1.2.6 shows such a map for the same function

1.3  Vector Fields 
 
A  vector  is  a  quantity which  has  both  a magnitude  and  a  direction  in  space. Vectors  are 
used  to describe physical quantities  such  as velocity, momentum,  acceleration  and  force, 
associated with an object. However, when we try to describe a system which consists of a 
large number of objects (e.g., moving water, snow, rain,…) we need  to assign a vector  to 
each individual object.  
 
As an example, let’s consider falling snowflakes, as shown in Figure 1.3.1. As snow falls, 
each  snowflake  moves  in  a  specific  direction.  The  motion  of  the  snowflakes  can  be 
analyzed by taking a series of photographs. At any instant in time, we can assign, to each 
snowflake, a velocity vector which characterizes its movement.  
 

 

 

 
Figure 1.3.1 Falling snow. 

 

6

The  falling  snow  is  an  example  of  a  collection  of  discrete  bodies.  On  the  other  hand,  if 
we  try  to  analyze  the  motion  of  continuous  bodies  such  as  fluids,  a  velocity  vector  then 
needs  to  be  assigned  to  every  point  in  the  fluid  at  any  instant  in  time.  Each  vector 
describes  the  direction  and magnitude  of  the  velocity  at  a  particular  point  and  time.  The 
collection  of  all  the  velocity  vectors  is  called  the  velocity  vector  field.    An  important 
distinction  between  a  vector  field  and  a  scalar  field  is  that  the  former  contains 
information  about  both  the  direction  and  the  magnitude  at  every  point  in  space,  while 
only  a  single  variable  is  specified  for  the  latter.  An  example  of  a  system  of  continuous 
bodies is air flow.

where  the  components  are  scalar  fields.  Below  we  use  fluids  to  examine  the  properties 
associated with a vector field since fluid flows are the easiest vector fields to visualize.  
 
In Figure  1.4.1 we  show  physical  examples  of  a  fluid  flow  field, where we  represent  the 
fluid  by  a  finite  number  of  particles  to  show  the  structure  of  the  flow.  In  Figure1.4.1(a), 
particles  (fluid  elements)  appear  at  the  center  of  a  cone  (a  “source”)  and  then  flow 
downward under  the effect of gravity.   That  is, we create particles at  the origin, and  they 
subsequently  flow  away  from  their  creation  point.    We  also  call  this  a  diverging  flow, 
since  the  particles  appear  to  “diverge”  from  the  creation  point.    Figure  1.4.1(b)  is  the 
converse of this, a converging flow, or a “sink” of particles.

Another representation of a diverging flow is in depicted in Figure 1.4.2.

Here the direction of the flow is represented by a texture pattern in which the direction of 
correlation in the texture is along the field direction.    
 
Figure  1.4.3(a)  shows  a  source  next  to  a  sink  of  lesser  magnitude,  and  Figure  1.4.3(b) 
shows two sources of unequal strength.

where the sink is smaller than the source, and (b) two sources of unequal strength. 
 
Finally,  in  Figure  1.4.4,  we  illustrate  a  constant  downward  flow  interacting  with  a 
diverging  flow  (source).    The  diverging  flow  is  able  to  make  some  headway  “upwards” 
against  the  downward  constant  flow,  but  eventually  turns  and  flows  downward, 
overwhelmed by the strength of the “downward” flow.

Animation 1.2: Circulations 
 
A  flow  field which  is  neither  a  source  nor  a  sink may  exhibit  another  class of behavior  -  
circulation.  In  Figure  1.4.5(a)  we  show  a  physical  example  of  a  circulating  flow  field 
where  particles  are  not  created  or  destroyed  (except  at  the  beginning  of  the  animation), 
but  merely  move  in  circles.  The  purely  circulating  flow  can  also  be  represented  by 
textures, as shown in Figure 1.4.5(b).  
 

 

 

 
Figure 1.4.5 (a) An example of a circulating fluid. (b) Representing a circulating flow 
using textures. 
 
A flow field can have more than one system of circulation centered about different points 
in space.    In Figure 1.4.6(a) we show a  flow field with  two circulations. The  flows are  in 
opposite  senses,  and one of  the  circulations  is  stronger  than  the other.    In Figure 1.4.6(b) 
we have the same situation, except that now the two circulations are in the same sense.

circulation. (b) the same direction of circulation 
 
In Figure 1.4.7, we show a constant downward flow  interacting with a counter-clockwise 
circulating  flow.    The  circulating  flow  is  able  to  make  some  headway  against  the 
downward  constant  flow,  but  eventually  is  overwhelmed  by  the  strength  of  the 
“downward” flow.   
 

 

 
Figure  1.4.7 A constant downward  flow  interacting with a counter-clockwise circulating 
flow. 
In  the  language  of  vector  calculus,  the  flows  shown  in  Figures  1.4.5  through  1.4.7  are 
said to have a non-zero curl, but zero divergence.  In contrast, the flows shown in Figures 
1.4.2  through  1.4.4  have  a  zero  curl  (they  do  not  move  in  circles)  and  a  non-zero 
divergence (particles are created or destroyed).   
 
Finally,  in  Figure  1.4.8,  we  show  a  fluid  flow  field  that  has  both  a  circulation  and  a 
divergence  (both  the  divergence  and  the  curl  of  the  vector  field  are  non-zero).    Any 
vector  field  can  be  written  as  the  sum  of  a  curl-free  part  (no  circulation)  and  a 
divergence-free  part  (no  source  or  sink).   We will  find  in  our  study  of  electrostatics  and 
magnetostatics  that  the  electrostatic  fields  are  curl  free  (e.g.  they  look  like  Figures  1.4.2 
through  1.4.4)  and  the  magnetic  fields  are  divergence  free  (e.g.  they  look  like  Figures 
1.4.5  and  1.4.6).    Only  when  dealing  with  time-varying  situations  will  we  encounter 
electric  fields  that  have both  a  divergence  and  a  curl.   Figure  1.4.8  depicts  a  field whose 
curl and divergence are non-vanishing. As far as we know even in time-varying situations 
magnetic  fields  always  remain  divergence-free.    Therefore,  magnetic  fields  will  always 
look like the patterns shown in Figures 1.4.5 through 1.4.7.

1.4.1 Relationship Between Fluid Fields and Electromagnetic Fields 
 
Vector  fields  that  represent  fluid  flow  have  an  immediate  physical  interpretation:    the 
vector at every point  in space  represents a direction of motion of a fluid element, and we 
can  construct  animations  of  those  fields,  as  above,  which  show  that  motion.    A  more 
general vector field, for example  the electric and magnetic fields discussed below, do not 
have  that  immediate physical  interpretation of a  flow  field.   There  is no “flow” of a  fluid 
along an electric field or magnetic field.   
 
 
However,  even  though  the  vectors  in  electromagnetism  do  not  represent  fluid  flow,  we 
carry  over  many  of  the  terms  we  use  to  describe  fluid  flow  to  describe  electromagnetic 
fields as well.  For example we will speak of the flux (flow) of the electric field through a 
surface.    If we were  talking  about  fluid  flow,  “flux” would  have  a well-defined  physical 
meaning, in that the flux would be the amount of fluid flowing across a given surface per 
unit  time.    There  is  no  such  meaning  when  we  talk  about  the  flux  of  the  electric  field 
through  a  surface,  but we  still  use  the  same  term  for  it,  as  if we were  talking  about  fluid 
flow.   Similarly we will  find  that magnetic vector  field  exhibit patterns  like  those  shown 
above for circulating flows, and we will sometimes talk about the circulation of magnetic 
fields.  But there is no fluid circulating along the magnetic field direction.   
 
We use much of  the  terminology of  fluid  flow  to describe electromagnetic  fields because 
it  helps  us  understand  the  structure  of  electromagnetic  fields  intuitively.    However,  we 
must always be aware that the analogy is limited. 
 

 
1.5  Gravitational Field 
 
The gravitational field of the Earth is another example of a vector field which can be used 
to  describe  the  interaction  between  a  massive  object  and  the  Earth.  According  to 
m
Newton’s universal  law of gravitation,  the gravitational  force between  two masses
 and 
M  is given by

where  r  is  the  distance  between  the  two  masses  and 
 is  the  unit  vector  located  at  the

position  of  m
  that  points  from M  towards 
.  The  constant  of  proportionality  is  the

attractive,  with  its  magnitude  being  proportional  to  the  inverse  square  of  the  distance 
between the masses.  
 
As  an  example,  if  M  is  the  mass  of  the  Earth,  the  gravitational  field  g(cid:71) at  a  point  P  in 
space, defined as the gravitational force per unit mass, can be written as

Notice  that  a  mass  in  a  constant  gravitational  field  does  not  necessarily  move  in  the 
direction of  the field. This  is  true only when  its  initial velocity  is  in  the same direction as 
the  field.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  initial  velocity  has  a  component  perpendicular  to  the 
gravitational field, the trajectory will be parabolic. 
 
 
1.6  Electric Fields 
 
The  interaction between electric charges at rest  is called  the electrostatic force. However, 
unlike  mass  in  gravitational  force,  there  are  two  types  of  electric  charge:  positive  and 
negative.  Electrostatic  force  between  charges  falls  off  as  the  inverse  square  of  their 
distance  of  separation,  and  can  be  either  attractive  or  repulsive.  Electric  charges  exert 
forces  on  each  other  in  a  manner  that  is  analogous  to  gravitation.  Consider  an  object 
P  a distance  r  from  Q  will

1.7  Magnetic Field 
 
Magnetic field is another example of a vector field. The most familiar source of magnetic 
fields  is  a  bar magnet. One  end  of  the  bar magnet  is  called  the North  pole  and  the  other, 
the South pole. Like poles repel while opposite poles attract (Figure 1.7.1). 
 

 
Figure 1.7.1 Magnets attracting and repelling 

 

 
If  we  place  some  compasses  near  a  bar  magnet,  the  needles  will  align  themselves  along 
the direction of the magnetic field, as shown in Figure 1.7.2. 
 

 

 
Figure 1.7.2 Magnetic field of a bar magnet 
 
The  observation  can  be  explained  as  follows: A magnetic  compass  consists  of  a  tiny  bar 
magnet that can rotate freely about a pivot point passing through the center of the magnet. 
When  a  compass  is placed near  a bar magnet which produces  an  external magnetic  field, 
it  experiences  a  torque  which  tends  to  align  the  north  pole  of  the  compass  with  the 
external magnetic field. 
 

 

14

The  Earth’s  magnetic  field  behaves  as  if  there  were  a  bar  magnet  in  it  (Figure  1.7.3). 
Note that the south pole of the magnet is located in the northern hemisphere.

1.8  Representations of a Vector Field 
 
How  do  we  represent  vector  fields?  Since  there  is  much  more  information  (magnitude 
and  direction)  in  a  vector  field,  our  visualizations  are  correspondingly  more  complex 
when compared to the representations of scalar fields. 
 
Let  us  introduce  an  analytic  form  for  a vector  field  and discuss  the various ways  that we 
represent it. Let

(1.8.1) 

                 
This field  is proportional  to  the electric  field of  two point charges of opposite signs, with 
the magnitude of the positive charge three times that of the negative charge.  The positive 
charge  is  located  at  (0
 and  the  negative  charge  is  located  at  (0
.   We  discuss 
, 0)d−
, 0)d
,
,
how this field is calculated in Section 2.7. 
 

1.8.1 Vector Field Representation 
 
Figure  1.8.1  is  an  example  of  a  “vector  field”  representation  of  Eq.  (1.8.1),  in  the  plane 
where  z  =  0.    We  show  the  charges  that  would  produce  this  field  if  it  were  an  electric 
field,  one  positive  (the  orange  charge)  and  one  negative  (the  blue  charge).    We  will 
always use this color scheme to represent positive and negative charges.   
 

 

15

 

 
Figure  1.8.1  A  “vector  field”  representation  of  the  field  of  two  point  charges,  one 
negative  and  one  positive,  with  the  magnitude  of  the  positive  charge  three  times  that  of 
the negative charge.  In the applet linked to this figure, one can vary the magnitude of the 
charges and the spacing of the vector field grid, and move the charges about. 
In  the  vector  field  representation,  we  put  arrows  representing  the  field  direction  on  a 
rectangular grid.  The direction of the arrow at a given location represents the direction of 
the  vector  field  at  that  point.    In  many  cases,  we  also  make  the  length  of  the  vector 
proportional  to  the  magnitude  of  the  vector  field  at  that  point.    But  we  also  may  show 
only  the  direction with  the  vectors  (that  is make  all  vectors  the  same  length),  and  color-
code  the  arrows  according  to  the  magnitude  of  the  vector.    Or  we  may  not  give  any 
information  about  the magnitude  of  the  field  at all,  but  just  use  the  arrows  on  the  grid  to 
indicate the direction of the field at that point.   
 
Figure 1.8.1 is an example of the latter situation.  That is, we use the arrows on the vector 
field grid to simply indicate the direction of the field, with no indication of the magnitude 
of  the  field,  either  by  the  length  of  the  arrows  or  their  color.   Note  that  the  arrows  point 
away  from  the  positive  charge  (the  positive  charge  is  a  “source”  for  electric  field)  and 
towards the negative charge (the negative charge is a “sink” for electric field).    
 

1.8.2 Field Line Representation 
 
There  are  other  ways  to  represent  a  vector  field.    One  of  the  most  common  is  to  draw 
“field  lines.”   Faraday  called  the  field  lines  for  electric  field  “lines  of  force.”   To  draw  a 
field line, start out at any point in space and move a very short distance in the direction of 
the local vector field, drawing a line as you do so.  After that short distance, stop, find the 
new direction of  the  local vector  field  at  the point where you  stopped, and begin moving 
again  in  that new direction.   Continue  this  process  indefinitely.   Thereby you  construct  a 
line  in  space  that  is  everywhere  tangent  to  the  local  vector  field.    If  you  do  this  for 
different  starting  points,  you  can  draw  a  set  of  field  lines  that  give  a  good  representation 
of  the  properties  of  the  vector  field.      Figure  1.8.2  below  is  an  example  of  a  field  line 
representation for the same two charges we used in Figure 1.8.1.   
 

 

16

 

 
The field lines are everywhere tangent to the local field direction. 
 
In summary, the field lines are a representation of the collection of vectors that constitute 
the field, and they are drawn according to the following rules: 
 
(1) The direction of the field line at any point in space is tangent to the field at that point. 
 
(2)  The  field  lines  never  cross  each  other,  otherwise  there  would  be  two  different  field 
directions at the point of intersection. 
 

1.8.3 Grass Seeds and Iron Filings Representations 
 
The  final  representation  of  vector  fields  is  the  “grass  seeds”  representation  or  the  “iron 
filings”  representation.    For  an  electric  field,  this  name  derives  from  the  fact  that  if  you 
scatter grass seeds in a strong electric field, they will orient themselves with the long axis 
of the seed parallel to the local field direction.  They thus provide a dense sampling of the 
shape  of  the  field.    Figure  1.8.4  is  a  “grass  seeds”  representation  of  the  electric  field  for 
the same two charges in Figures 1.8.1 and 1.8.2.   
 

 
Figure  1.8.4:    A  “grass  seeds”  representation  of  the  electric  field  that  we  considered  in 
Figures 1.8.1 and 1.8.2.  In the applet linked to this figure, one can generate “grass seeds” 
representations for different amounts of charge and different positions. 
 

 

 

17

The  local  field  direction  is  in  the  direction  in  which  the  texture  pattern  in  this  figure  is 
correlated.   This “grass seeds” representation gives by far  the most  information about  the 
spatial structure of the field.   
 
We will  also  use  this  technique  to  represent magnetic  fields,  but when  used  to  represent 
magnetic  fields  we  call  it  the  “iron  filings”  representation.    This  name  derives  from  the 
fact  that  if  you  scatter  iron  filings  in  a  strong magnetic  field,  they will  orient  themselves 
with  their  long  axis  parallel  to  the  local  field  direction.    They  thus  provide  a  dense 
sampling of the shape of the magnetic field.   
 
A  frequent  question  from  the  student  new  to  electromagnetism  is  “What  is  between  the 
field  lines?”    Figures  1.8.2  and  1.8.4  make  the  answer  to  that  question  clear.    What  is 
between  the  field  lines  are  more  field  lines  that  we  have  chosen  not  to  draw.  The  field 
itself is a continuous feature of the space between the charges.  
 

1.8.4 Motion of Electric and Magnetic Field Lines 
 
In  this course we will show  the spatial structure of electromagnetic  fields using all of  the 
methods  discussed  above.  In  addition,  for  the  field  line  and  the  grass  seeds  and  iron 
filings  representation,  we  will  frequently  show  the  time  evolution  of  the  fields.  We  do 
this  by  having  the  field  lines  and  the  grass  seed  patterns  or  iron  filings  patterns move  in 
the  direction  of  the  energy  flow  in  the  electromagnetic  field  at  a  given  point  in  space.  
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
The  flow  is  in  the  direction  of  ×E B
,  the  cross  product  of  the  electric  field  E
 and  the 
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
magnetic  field 
, and  is perpendicular  to both  E
 and  B
. This  is very different  from our 
B
representation  of  fluid  flow  fields  above,  where  the  direction  of  the  flow  is  in  the  same 
direction  as  the  velocity  field  itself.    We  will  discuss  the  concept  on  energy  flow  in 
electromagnetic fields toward the end of the course.   
 
We  adopt  this  representation  for  time-changing  electromagnetic  fields  because  these 
fields can both support  the  flow of energy and can store energy as well.   We will discuss 
quantitatively  how  to  compute  this  energy  flow  later,  when  we  discuss  the  Poynting 
vector  in  Chapter  13.    For  now we  simply  note  that when we  animate  the motion  of  the 
field line or grass seeds or iron filings representations, the direction of the pattern motion 
indicates the direction in which energy in the electromagnetic field is flowing.
