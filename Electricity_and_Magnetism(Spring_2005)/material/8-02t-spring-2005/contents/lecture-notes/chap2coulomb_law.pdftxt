Coulomb’s Law 
 

2.1 Electric Charge 
 
There  are  two  types  of  observed  electric  charge,  which  we  designate  as  positive  and 
negative.  The convention was derived from Benjamin Franklin’s experiments. He rubbed 
a  glass  rod with  silk  and  called  the  charges  on  the  glass  rod  positive. He  rubbed  sealing 
wax with  fur  and  called  the  charge  on  the  sealing wax  negative.   Like  charges  repel  and 
opposite charges attract each other. The unit of charge is called the Coulomb (C).   
 
The smallest unit of “free” charge known in nature is the charge of an electron or proton, 
which has a magnitude of

Charge of  any ordinary matter  is quantized  in  integral multiples of e. An  electron  carries 
e−
e+ . In 
, while a proton carries one unit of positive charge, 
one unit of negative charge, 
a  closed  system,  the  total  amount  of  charge  is  conserved  since  charge  can  neither  be 
created nor destroyed. A charge can, however, be transferred from one body to another.

Animation 2.1: Van de Graaff Generator 
 
Consider  Figure  2.2.2(a)  below.  The  figure  illustrates  the  repulsive  force  transmitted 
between  two  objects  by  their  electric  fields.  The  system  consists  of  a  charged  metal 
sphere of a van de Graaff generator.  This sphere is fixed in space and is not free to move.  
The  other  object  is  a  small  charged  sphere  that  is  free  to  move  (we  neglect  the  force  of 
gravity  on  this  sphere).   According  to  Coulomb’s  law,  these  two  like  charges  repel  each 
another.    That  is,  the  small  sphere  experiences  a  repulsive  force  away  from  the  van  de 
Graaff sphere.   
 

 
 
Figure  2.2.2  (a)  Two  charges  of  the  same  sign  that  repel  one  another  because  of  the 
“stresses”  transmitted  by  electric  fields.    We  use  both  the  “grass  seeds”  representation 
and  the  ”field  lines”  representation  of  the  electric  field  of  the  two  charges.  (b)  Two 
charges  of  opposite  sign  that  attract  one  another  because  of  the  stresses  transmitted  by 
electric fields. 
 
The  animation  depicts  the  motion  of  the  small  sphere  and  the  electric  fields  in  this 
situation.    Note  that  to  repeat  the  motion  of  the  small  sphere  in  the  animation,  we  have 

 

3

the  small  sphere  “bounce  off”  of  a  small  square  fixed  in  space  some  distance  from  the 
van de Graaff generator.   
 
Before we  discuss  this  animation,  consider  Figure  2.2.2(b), which  shows  one  frame  of  a 
movie of the interaction of two charges with opposite signs.  Here the charge on the small 
sphere is opposite to that on the van de Graaff sphere. By Coulomb’s law, the two objects 
now attract one another, and  the small sphere  feels a  force attracting  it  toward  the van de 
Graaff.  To  repeat  the  motion  of  the  small  sphere  in  the  animation,  we  have  that  charge 
“bounce off” of a square fixed in space near the van de Graaff.  
 
The  point  of  these  two  animations  is  to  underscore  the  fact  that  the  Coulomb  force 
between  the  two  charges  is not “action at a distance.” Rather,  the  stress  is  transmitted by 
direct  “contact”  from  the  van  de  Graaff  to  the  immediately  surrounding  space,  via  the 
electric field of the charge on the van de Graaff.   That stress is then transmitted from one 
element of space  to a neighboring element,  in a continuous manner, until it is transmitted 
to  the  region  of  space  contiguous  to  the  small  sphere,  and  thus  ultimately  to  the  small 
sphere  itself.    Although  the  two  spheres  are  not  in  direct  contact  with  one  another,  they 
are  in  direct  contact  with  a  medium  or  mechanism  that  exists  between  them.    The  force 
between  the  small  sphere  and  the  van  de  Graaff  is  transmitted  (at  a  finite  speed)  by 
stresses induced in the intervening space by their presence.     
 
Michael  Faraday  invented  field  theory;  drawing  “lines  of  force”  or  “field  lines”  was  his 
way  of  representing  the  fields.    He  also  used  his  drawings  of  the  lines  of  force  to  gain 
insight  into  the  stresses  that  the  fields  transmit.    He  was  the  first  to  suggest  that  these 
fields,  which  exist  continuously  in  the  space  between  charged  objects,  transmit  the 
stresses that result in forces between the objects.   
 
 
2.3  Principle of Superposition 
 
Coulomb’s  law  applies  to  any  pair  of  point  charges.  When  more  than  two  charges  are 
present, the net force on any one charge is simply the vector sum of the forces exerted on 
it  by  the  other  charges.  For  example,  if  three  charges  are  present,  the  resultant  force

2.4 Electric Field  
 
The  electrostatic  force,  like  the gravitational  force,  is  a  force  that  acts  at  a distance,  even 
when  the  objects  are  not  in  contact  with  one  another.  To  justify  such  the  notion  we 
rationalize action at a distance by saying that one charge creates a field which in turn acts 
on the other charge.  
 
An  electric  charge  q  produces  an  electric  field  everywhere.    To  quantify  the  strength  of 
0q
the  field  created  by  that  charge,  we  can  measure  the  force  a  positive  “test  charge”

2.5 Electric Field Lines 
 
Electric  field  lines  provide  a  convenient  graphical  representation  of  the  electric  field  in 
space. The field lines for a positive and a negative charges are shown in Figure 2.5.1. 
 

(a) 

(b) 

 

Figure 2.5.1 Field lines for (a) positive and (b) negative charges. 
 
Notice  that  the  direction  of  field  lines  is  radially  outward  for  a  positive  charge  and 
radially  inward  for  a  negative  charge.  For  a  pair  of  charges  of  equal  magnitude  but 
opposite sign (an electric dipole), the field lines are shown in Figure 2.5.2. 
 

 
Figure 2.5.2 Field lines for an electric dipole. 

 

 
 
The pattern of electric field lines can be obtained by considering the following: 
 
(1)  Symmetry:  For  every  point  above  the  line  joining  the  two  charges  there  is  an 
equivalent  point  below  it.  Therefore,  the  pattern  must  be  symmetrical  about  the  line 
joining the two charges 
 
(2)  Near  field:  Very  close  to  a  charge,  the  field  due  to  that  charge  predominates. 
Therefore, the lines are radial and spherically symmetric. 
 
(3)  Far field: Far from the system of charges, the pattern should look like that of a single 
point  charge  of  value 
.  Thus,  the  lines  should  be  radially  outward,  unless 
Q = ∑ Q
i
i
. 
0Q =
 
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
(4)  Null point: This is a point at which  =E 0

, and no field lines should pass through it. 

 

8

 
The properties of electric field lines may be summarized as follows: 
 
(cid:71)
•  The direction of the electric field vector  E
 
•  The  number  of  lines  per  unit  area  through  a  surface  perpendicular  to  the  line  is 
devised to be proportional to the magnitude of the electric field in a given region. 

 at a point is tangent to the field lines. 

 
•  The  field  lines  must  begin  on  positive  charges  (or  at  infinity)  and  then  terminate  on 
negative charges (or at infinity). 

 
•  The number of lines that originate from a positive charge or terminating on a negative 
charge must be proportional to the magnitude of the charge. 

 
•  No  two  field  lines  can  cross  each other; otherwise  the  field would be pointing  in  two 
different directions at the same point.

Figure 2.7.3 shows an interactive ShockWave simulation of how the dipole pattern arises.  
At  the  observation  point,  we  show  the  electric  field  due  to  each  charge,  which  sum 
vectorially  to give  the  total field.   To get a feel for  the  total electric field, we also show a 
“grass seeds” representation of the electric field in this case. The observation point can be 
moved  around  in  space  to  see  how  the  resultant  field  at  various  points  arises  from  the 
individual contributions of the electric field of each charge.

charges  distributed  in  some  region  in  space?  Let’s  consider  the  system  shown  in  Figure

In  this  infinite  length  limit,  the  system  has  cylindrical  symmetry.  In  this  case,  an

Example 2.4: Electric Field on the Axis of a Ring 
 
A non-conducting ring of radius R with a uniform charge density λ and a total charge  Q  
is  lying  in  the  xy - plane, as shown  in Figure 2.10.5. Compute  the electric  field at a point 
P, located at a distance z from the center of the ring along its axis of symmetry.

Notice that the electric field at the center of the ring vanishes. This is to be expected from 
symmetry arguments. 
 
 
 
Example 2.5: Electric Field Due to a Uniformly Charged Disk 
 
 lies in the xy-plane. Find the 
A uniformly charged disk of radius   R  with a total charge

P
R
z(cid:21)
perpendicular to its plane. Discuss the limit where 
. 
 
Solution: 
 
By  treating  the disk as a  set of concentric uniformly charged  rings,  the problem could be 
solved  by  using  the  result  obtained  in  Example  2.4.  Consider  a  ring  of  radius  r ′ and 
dr ′
thickness
, as shown in Figure 2.10.8. 
 

 
 
Figure 2.10.8 A uniformly charged disk of radius R. 

 
By  symmetry  arguments,  the  electric  field  at P  points  in  the z+ -direction.  Since  the  ring 
has  a  charge

2.12  Problem-Solving Strategies 
 
In  this  chapter,  we  have  discussed  how  electric  field  can  be  calculated  for  both  the 
discrete  and  continuous  charge  distributions.  For  the  former,  we  apply  the  superposition 
principle:

(cid:71)

(d)  The  electric  force  is  39  orders  of  magnitude  stronger  than  the  gravitational  force 
between  the  electron  and  the  proton.  Then  why  are  the  large  scale  motions  of  planets 
determined  by  the  gravitational  force  and  not  the  electrical  force.  The  answer  is  that  the

magnitudes of the charge of the electron and proton are equal. The best experi

that  the  difference  between  these  magnitudes  is  a  number  on  the  order  of

objects  like  planets  have  about  the  same  number  of  protons  as  electrons,  they  are
