Faraday’s Law: Loop


A coil moves up from underneath a 
magnet with its north pole pointing 
upward.  The current in the coil and the 
force on the coil: 
1.  Current clockwise; force up 
2.  Current counterclockwise; force up 
3.  Current clockwise; force down 
4.  Current counterclockwise; force down 


Faraday’s Law: Loop 

PRS21: 4/01/04 

(3)  Current is clockwise; force is down 


The clockwise current creates a self-field 
downward, trying to offset the increase of 
magnetic flux through the coil as it moves 
upward into stronger fields (Lenz’s Law). 

The I ds x B force on the coil is a force 
which is trying to keep the flux through the 
coil from increasing by slowing it down 
(Lenz’s Law again).

Faraday’s Law: Rails


A conducting rod moves along 
conducting rails in a magnetic field 
which is out of the page.  The current in 
the rod and the force on the rod are: 

1. Current up and force to left 
2. Current down and force to left 

3. Current up and force to right 
4. Current down and force to right

(3)  Current is up; force on rod is to right. 


The clockwise current creates a self-field 
into the page – the current tries to offset the 
increase of magnetic flux in the loop due to 
the moving rod (Lenz’s Law). 

The I ds x B force on the rod is a force 
which is trying to keep the flux through the 
circuit from increasing by slowing the rod 
down (Lenz’s Law again).

Faraday’s Law: Loop


A circuit in the form of a rectangular 
piece of wire is pulled away from a long 
wire carrying current I in the direction 
shown in the sketch.  The induced 
current in the rectangular circuit is 
1. Clockwise 
2. Counterclockwise 
3. Neither, the current is zero  


Faraday’s Law: Loop

(1)  Clockwise.  The magnetic field due to 
the current in the long wire is into the page, 
and the flux through the rectangular circuit 
due to that field decreases as the circuit 
moves away.  So the induced current is 
clockwise, so as to generate an induced B 
field into the page that is trying to keep the 
magnetic flux into the page from decreasing. 
Note: I ds x B force is left on the left segment 
and right on the right, but the force on the left is 
bigger.  So the net force on the rectangular 
circuit is to the left, again trying to keep the flux 
from decreasing by slowing the circuit’s motion.

Faraday’s Law: Generator 


A square coil rotates in a magnetic field 
directed to the right.  At the time shown, 
the current in the square, when looking 
down from the top of the square loop, 
will be 
1. Counterclockwise. 

2. Clockwise

Faraday’s Law: Generator


(1)  Current is counterclockwise.  The flux 
through the loop decreases as the normal 
rotates away from the B field.  To try to 
keep that flux from decreasing, the induced 
current in the square will be CCW, to 
produce an induced B field in the loop along 
the normal in the loop and therefore trying 
to keep the magnetic flux from decreasing 
(Lenz’s Law) 
The I ds x B force on the sides of the square 

loop will be such as to produce a torque that 

tries to stop if from rotating (Lenz’s Law).

Loop in Uniform Field 
Bout 

v 
A rectangular wire loop is pulled thru a 
uniform magnetic field penetrating its top 
half, as shown.  The induced current and 
the force and torque on the loop are: 
1. Current CW, Force Left, No Torque 

2. Current CW, No Force, Torque 
Rotates CCW 
3. Current CCW, Force Left, No Torque  

4. Current CCW, No Force, Torque 
Rotates CCW 
5. No current, force or torque

v 

(5)  No current, force or torque. 


The motion does not change the 
magnetic flux, so Faraday’s Law says 
there is no induced EMF, or current, or 
force, or torque. 

Of course, if we were pulling at all up or 
down there would be a force to oppose 
that motion.
