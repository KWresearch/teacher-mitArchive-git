E from V


The graph above shows a potential V as a 
function of x.  The magnitude of the 
electric field for x > 0 is 
1.  larger than that for x < 0  

2.  smaller than that for x < 0  

3.  equal to that for x <  0 
4.  I don’t know

(2)  The electric field for x > 0  is 
smaller than that for the electric field 
for x < 0  because the slope of the 
potential is smaller in the region x> 0 
as compared to x < 0.  Translation: 
The hill is steeper on the left than on 
the right.

E from V


The graph above shows a potential V as a 
function of x.  Which is true? 
1.  Ex > 0 is > 0 and Ex < 0 is > 0 
2.  Ex > 0 is > 0 and Ex < 0 is < 0 
3.  Ex > 0 is < 0 and Ex < 0 is < 0 
4.  Ex > 0 is < 0 and Ex < 0 is > 0 
I don’t know

(2)  The electric field for x > 0 is in the 
positive x-direction, because as x 
decreases for x > 0 the potential 
increases, which can only happen if the 
electric field opposes movement to 
smaller x for x > 0.  Translation: 
“Downhill” is to the left on the left and 
to the right on the right.

Should We Use Gauss’ Law?


For which of the following uniform 
charge distributions can we use Gauss’ 
Law to determine the electric field? 

A. Concentric nested spherical shells 
B.  Non-concentric nested spherical shells  

C.  Finite line of charge 
D.  Infinite line of charge 
E.  Thin, infinite, sheet of charge 
F.  Thick, infinite, slab of charge 

1. None of them 
3. A, B, C only 
5. A, D, E, F only 
7. A, D, E only 

2. All of them 
4. D, E, F only 
6. C, D only 
8. C, D, E, F only


PRS05 
Should We Use Gauss’ Law? 


(5)  A, D, E & F 

In order to effectively use Gauss’ 
law, the charge distribution must 
have either spherical, cylindrical or 
planar symmetry. 

• Concentric spheres have spherical 

symmetry, non-concentric do not 

• Infinite lines have cylindrical 
symmetry, finite do not 
• Infinite planes and slabs of charge 
both exhibit planar symmetry 

Spherical Shell 

PRS05 

We just saw that in a solid sphere of 

charge the electric field grows 
linearly with distance. 
Inside the charged 
spherical shell at left 
(r<a) what does the 
electric field do? 

a 

Q 

1.  Constant and Zero 
2.  Constant but Non-Zero 

3.  Still grows linearly 
4.  Some other functional form 

(use Gauss’ Law to determine)  

5.  Can’t determine with Gauss Law




PRS05 

Spherical Shell 

1.  Constant and Zero 


We have spherical symmetry so we 
can use Gauss’ Law with a spherical 
surface.  Any surface inside the 
spherical shell will contain no 
charge and hence have no flux 
through it.  E = 0! 



E Field from Slab


PRS05 

A positively charged, semi-infinite 
flat slab has thickness D. 

The z-axis is perpendicular to the 
sheet, with center at z = 0. 

At the plane’s center (z = 0), E 
1. points in the positive z-direction 
2. points in the negative z-direction 
3. is zero 
4. I don’t know 

PRS05 

E Field from Slab


(3) At the center of the slab the 
electric field is 0. 

Symmetry tell us this – the amount 
of charge above and below the 
center of the plane is equal hence 
the fields cancel. 
Another way of saying this is that 
since you don’t know which way 
the field would point it must be 0. 

E Field from Slab


PRS05 

A positively charged, semi-infinite 
flat slab has thickness D. 
The z-axis is perpendicular to the 
sheet, with at z = 0. 

A distance z from its central plane,  

1. E  is constant 
21 
2. E ∝ 
z 
1 
3. E ∝ 
z 
4. E ∝ z 
5. I don't know 

E Field from Slab


PRS05 

(4) E is proportional to z inside the 
slab. 

As you move away from the center, 
an imbalance is generated in the 
amount of charge below you and the 
amount above you.  This imbalance 
grows linearly with z, and is what 
leads to the E field that you see. 

Once outside the slab, the 
imbalance stops changing so the 
field is constant.
