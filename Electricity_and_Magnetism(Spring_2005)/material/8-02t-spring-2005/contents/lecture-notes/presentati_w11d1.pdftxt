Self Inductance
L N I
= Φ
To Calculate:
1. Assume a current I is flowing in your device
2. Calculate the B field due to that I
3. Calculate the flux due to that B field
4. Calculate the self inductance (divide out I)

Inductors hate change, like steady state
They are the opposite of capacitors

t=0+: Current is trying to change.  Inductor works as 
hard as it needs to to stop it
t=∞: Current is steady.  Inductor does nothing.

LC Circuit 

1.  Set up the circuit above with capacitor, inductor,  
resistor, and battery. 
2.  Let the capacitor become fully charged. 
3.  Throw the switch from a to b 
4.  What happens? 

P25 (cid:173)

LC Circuit 
It undergoes simple harmonic motion, just like a 
mass on a spring, with trade-off between charge on 
capacitor (Spring) and current in inductor (Mass)
