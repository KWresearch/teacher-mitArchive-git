Measuring Potential Difference
A voltmeter must be hooked in parallel across the 
element you want to measure the potential difference 
across

Voltmeters have a very large resistance, so that 
they don’t affect the circuit too much

P12-

Measuring Current
An ammeter must be hooked in series with the 
element you want to measure the current through

Ammeters have a very low resistance, so that 
they don’t affect the circuit too much

P12-

Measuring Resistance
An ohmmeter must be hooked in parallel across the 
element you want to measure the resistance of

Here we are measuring R1

Ohmmeters apply a voltage and measure the 
current that flows.  They typically won’t work if the 
resistor is powered (connected to a battery)
