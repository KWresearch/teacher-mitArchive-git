Consider the above circular capacitor, and 
the Amperian loop (radius r) in the plane 
midway between the plates. When the 
capacitor is charging, the line integral of the 
magnetic field around the Amperian loop is 
1. Zero: No current crosses the surface spanning 
the Amperian loop 
2. Zero: The magnetic field is perpendicular to the 
Amperian Loop 
3. Non-zero: An electric current flows between 
the capacitor plates 
4. Non-zero: There is time changing electric flux 
on the surface spanning the Amperian Loop

Answer: 4.  When the capacitor is 
charging up, the line integral of the 
magnetic field around the Amperian loop 
is non-zero because there is a time 
changing electric flux on the flat disc that 
spans the Amperian Loop

The plot above shows a side and a top view of 
a capacitor with charge Q with electric and 
magnetic fields E and B at time t.  The 
charge Q is: 
1.  Increasing in time  

2.  Constant in time. 
3.  Decreasing in time.  

4.  Don’t have a clue.

Answer:  1.  The charge Q is increasing in 
time. 
The B field is counterclockwise, which 
means that the current (real & 
displacement) must be flowing out of the 
page = up.  So there is more charge being 
carried to the bottom plate.

The graph shows a plot of the function 
y = cos( k x ).  The value of k is 
1.  1/2 
2.  1/4 
3.  π 
4.  π /2 
5.  Don’t have a clue

Answer:  4.  k = π /2 

λ = 4 Æ k = 2π/λ = π/2 

y = cos (π x /2) is 1 at –4, 0, 4, etc.

The graph shows the E (yellow) and B 
(blue) fields of a plane wave.  This wave is 
propagating in the 
1. +x  direction 
2.  –x direction 
3. +z direction 
4.  –z direction 
5. Don’t have a clue




PRS28 

Answer:  4.  –z direction. 


We can see this because this is the direction 
of E x B  (Yellow x Blue)

The plot above shows a side and a top view of 
a capacitor with charge Q with electric and 
magnetic fields E and B at time t.  The 
charge Q is: 
5.  Increasing in time  

6.  Constant in time. 
7.  Decreasing in time.  

8.  Don’t have a clue.

Answer:  1.  The charge Q is increasing 


The direction of the Poynting Flux S (=E x B) 
inside the capacitor is inward.  Therefore 
electromagnetic energy is flowing inward, 
and the energy in the electric field inside is 
increasing.  Thus Q must be increasing, since 
E is proportional to Q.

The plot above shows a side and a top view of 
a solenoid carrying current I with electric 
and magnetic fields E and B at time t.  In the 
solenoid, the current I is: 
1.  Increasing in time  

2.  Constant in time. 
3.  Decreasing in time.  

4.  Don’t have a clue.  




PRS28 

Answer:  3.  The current I is decreasing  


The Poynting Flux S (= E x B) inside the 
solenoid is outward from the center of the 
solenoid.  Therefore electromagnetic 
energy is flowing outward, and the energy 
in the magnetic field inside is decreasing. 
Thus I must be decreasing, since B is 
proportional to I.
