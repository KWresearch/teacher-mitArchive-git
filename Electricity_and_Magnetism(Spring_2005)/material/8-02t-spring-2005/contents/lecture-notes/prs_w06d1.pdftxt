Hall Effect


A conducting slab has current to the 
right.  A B field is applied out of the 
page.  Due to magnetic forces on the 
charge carriers, the bottom of the slab is 
at a higher electric potential than the top 
of the slab. 

I

B 
V > V(Top) 


On the basis of this experiment, the sign 
of the charge carriers that make up the 
current in the slab is: 
1)  positive 
2)  negative 
3)  cannot be determined

Look at the force on the carriers.  If 
positive, they are flowing to the right,

 will be down.  If negative

 will be down (don’t forget the

sign of q!)  So either way the force is 
down.  But we know that the result is a 
higher potential at the bottom – positive 
charges are moving down.  So the 
carriers are positive
