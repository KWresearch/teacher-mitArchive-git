Resistance 


When a current flows in a wire of length 
L and cross sectional area A, the 
resistance of the wire is 

1.  Proportional to A and inversely  

proportional to L. 

2.  Proportional to both A and  L. 

3.  Proportional to L and inversely  

proportional to A.  

4.  Inversely proportional to both L and 
A

(3)  Proportional to L and inversely 
proportional to A. 

The longer the wire the higher the 
resistance.  The bigger the cross-
sectional area of the wire, the more ways 
that current can flow through it, so the 
lower the resistance.  In equations, if the 
resistivity of  the material is ρ, then

Bulbs and Batteries

An ideal battery is hooked 
to a light bulb with wires. 
A second identical light 
bulb is connected in 
parallel to the first light 
bulb. After the second 
light bulb is connected, the 
current from the battery 
compared to when only 
one bulb was connected. 

1.  Is Higher 
2.  Is Lower 
3.  Is The Same  

4.  Don’t know

Bulbs and Batteries

(1)  More current flows 
from the battery 

There are several ways to 
see this: 

(A)  The equivalent 
resistance of the two light 
bulbs in parallel is half that 
of one of the bulbs, and 
since the resistance is 
lower the current is higher, 
for a given voltage. 

(B)  The battery must keep 
two resistances at the same 
potential Æ I doubles.

An ideal battery is hooked to a light bulb 
with wires.  A second identical light bulb 
is connected in series with the first light 
bulb. After the second light bulb is 
connected, the current from the battery 
compared to when only one bulb was 
connected. 
1.  Is Higher 
2.  Is Lower 
3.  Is The Same

(2)  The current from the battery is lower 


The equivalent resistance of the two light 
bulbs in series is twice that of one of the 
bulbs, and since the resistance is higher 
the current is lower, for a given voltage. 

(Translation)  The ski slope just got twice 
as hard so half as many skiers take it.

An ideal battery is hooked

A second identical light

parallel to the first light

light bulb is connected, the 
power output from the 
battery (compared to when 
only one bulb was 
connected) 

1.  Is four times higher 
2.  Is twice as high 
3.  Is the same 
4.  Is half as much

(2)  Twice as much 

The current from the 
battery must double (it 
must raise two light bulbs 
to the same voltage 
difference) and 
P=IV

An ideal battery is hooked to a light bulb 
with wires.  A second identical light bulb 
is connected in series with the first light 
bulb. After the second light bulb is 
connected, the light from the first bulb 
(compared to when only one bulb was 
connected) 
1.  is four times as bright 

2.  is twice as bright 
3.  is the same 
4.  is half as bright 
5.  is one quarter as bright

(5)  The light is ¼ as bright 

The resistance in the circuit doubled so 
the current is cut in half.  This means that 
the power delivered by the battery is half 
what it was.  But that power is further 
divided between two bulbs now.

P = I2R
