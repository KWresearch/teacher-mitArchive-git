9.1  Biot-Savart Law 
 
Currents  which  arise  due  to  the  motion  of  charges  are  the  source  of  magnetic  fields. 
When  charges  move  in  a  conducting  wire  and  produce  a  current  I,  the  magnetic  field  at 
any  point  P  due  to  the  current  can  be  calculated  by  adding  up  the  magnetic  field 
(cid:71)

, from small segments of the wire  d

These  segments  can  be  thought  of  as  a  vector  quantity  having  a magnitude  of  the  length 
of the segment and pointing in the direction of the current flow. The infinitesimal current 
(cid:71) .  
source can then be written as  I d s
 

ˆr
Let r denote as the distance form the current source to the field point P, and 
 the 
corresponding unit vector. The Biot-Savart law gives an expression for the magnetic field

Interactive Simulation 9.1: Magnetic Field of a Current Element 
 
Figure  9.1.2  is  an  interactive  ShockWave  display  that  shows  the  magnetic  field  of  a 
current element from Eq. (9.1.1). This interactive display allows you to move the position 
of the observer about the source current element to see how moving that position changes 
the value of the magnetic field at the position of the observer.

Example 9.1:  Magnetic Field due to a Finite Straight Wire  
 
A  thin,  straight  wire  carrying  a  current  I  is  placed  along  the  x-axis,  as  shown  in  Figure 
9.1.3. Evaluate the magnetic field at point P. Note that we have assumed that the leads to 
the ends of the wire make canceling contributions to the net magnetic field at the point

Note  that  in  this  limit,  the system possesses cylindrical symmetry, and  the magnetic field 
lines are circular, as shown in Figure 9.1.4. 

 

 

Figure 9.1.4 Magnetic field lines due to an infinite wire carrying current I. 

 
In  fact,  the  direction  of  the magnetic  field  due  to  a  long  straight wire  can  be  determined 
by the right-hand rule (Figure 9.1.5).

If  you  direct  your  right  thumb  along  the  direction  of  the  current  in  the  wire,  then  the

Solution:

9.1.1  Magnetic Field of a Moving Point Charge 
 
Suppose  we  have  an  infinitesimal  current  element  in  the  form  of  a  cylinder  of  cross-
sectional area A and length ds consisting of n charge carriers per unit volume, all moving 
(cid:71)  along the axis of the cylinder.  Let I be the current in the element, 
at a common velocity  v
which  we  define  as  the  amount  of  charge  passing  through  any  cross-section  of  the 
cylinder per unit time. From Chapter 6, we see that the current I can be written as

The  total  number  of  charge  carriers  in  the  current  element  is  simply

 due to the dN charge carriers is given by

Animation 9.2: Magnetic Field of Several Charges Moving in a Circle 
 
Suppose we want  to  calculate  the magnetic  fields  of  a  number  of  charges moving  on  the 
circumference of a circle with equal spacing between  the charges.   To calculate  this field 
we have to add up vectorially the magnetic fields of each of charges using Eq. (9.1.19).    
 

 

 
Figure  9.1.9  The  magnetic  field  of  four  charges  moving  in  a  circle.    We  show  the 
magnetic  field  vector  directions  in  only  one  plane.  The  bullet-like  icons  indicate  the 
direction of the magnetic field at that point in the array spanning the plane. 
 
Figure  9.1.9  shows  one  frame  of  the  animation  when  the  number  of  moving  charges  is 
four.  Other animations show the same situation for N =1, 2, and 8.  When we get to eight 
charges, a characteristic pattern emerges--the magnetic dipole pattern.   Far from the ring, 
the shape of the field lines is the same as the shape of the field lines for an electric dipole.   
 
 
Interactive Simulation 9.2: Magnetic Field of a Ring of Moving Charges 
 
Figure  9.1.10  shows  a  ShockWave  display  of  the  vectoral  addition  process  for  the  case 
where  we  have  30  charges  moving  on  a  circle.    The  display  in  Figure  9.1.10  shows  an 
observation  point  fixed  on  the  axis  of  the  ring.  As  the  addition  proceeds,  we  also  show 
the resultant up to that point (large arrow in the display).

Figure  9.1.11  The  magnetic  field  due  to  30  charges  moving  in  a  circle  at  a  given 
observation  point.    The  position  of  the  observation  point  can  be  varied  to  see  how  the 
magnetic  field of the individual charges adds up to give the total field. 
 
In  Figure  9.1.11,  we  show  an  interactive  ShockWave  display  that  is  similar  to  that  in 
Figure  9.1.10,  but  now  we  can  interact  with  the  display  to  move  the  position  of  the 
observer  about  in  space.   To  get  a  feel  for  the  total magnetic  field, we  also  show  a  “iron 
filings”  representation  of  the  magnetic  field  due  to  these  charges.    We  can  move  the 
observation  point  about  in  space  to  see  how  the  total  field  at  various  points  arises  from 
the individual contributions of the magnetic field of to each moving charge. 
 
 
9.2  Force Between Two Parallel Wires 
 
We have already seen  that a current-carrying wire produces a magnetic field. In addition, 
when  placed  in  a  magnetic  field,  a  wire  carrying  a  current  will  experience  a  net  force. 
Thus, we expect two current-carrying wires to exert force on each other. 
 
 Consider  two  parallel  wires  separated  by  a  distance  a  and  carrying  currents  I1  and  I2  in 
the +x-direction, as shown in Figure 9.2.1. 
 

 

 

Figure 9.2.1 Force between two parallel wires

The magnetic force, 
, exerted on wire 1 by wire 2 may be computed as follows: Using

Clearly

calculation  is  that  two  parallel  wires  carrying  currents  in  the  same  direction  will  attract 
each  other.  On  the  other  hand,  if  the  currents  flow  in  opposite  directions,  the  resultant 
force will be repulsive. 
 
 
Animation 9.3: Forces Between Current-Carrying Parallel Wires 
 
Figures 9.2.2 shows parallel wires carrying current in the same and in opposite directions.  
In  the  first  case,  the  magnetic  field  configuration  is  such  as  to  produce  an  attraction 
between  the  wires.    In  the  second  case  the  magnetic  field  configuration  is  such  as  to 
produce a repulsion between the wires.

9.3  Ampere’s Law 
 
We  have  seen  that moving  charges  or  currents  are  the  source  of magnetism. This  can  be 
readily demonstrated by placing compass needles near a wire. As shown in Figure 9.3.1a, 
all compass needles point in the same direction in the absence of current. However, when 
I ≠
0
,  the  needles  will  be  deflected  along  the  tangential  direction  of  the  circular  path 
(Figure 9.3.1b).

Ampere’s law 

The  generalization  to  any  closed  loop  of  arbitrary  shape  (see  for  example,  Figure  9.3.4) 
that involves many magnetic field lines is known as Ampere’s law:

Ampere’s  law  in  magnetism  is  analogous  to  Gauss’s  law  in  electrostatics.  In  order  to 
apply them, the system must possess certain symmetry. In the case of an infinite wire, the 
system  possesses  cylindrical  symmetry  and  Ampere’s  law  can  be  readily  applied. 
However, when the length of the wire is finite, Biot-Savart law must be used instead.

We see that the magnetic field is zero at the center of the wire and increases linearly with 
r  until  r=R.  Outside  the  wire,  the  field  falls  off  as  1/r.  The  qualitative  behavior  of  the 
field is depicted in Figure 9.3.6 below:

Solution: 
 
We  may  think  of  the  current  sheet  as  a  set  of  parallel  wires  carrying  currents  in  the  +x-
direction.  From  Figure  9.3.8,  we  see  that  magnetic  field  at  a  point  P  above  the  plane 
points  in  the  −y-direction.  The  z-component  vanishes  after  adding  up  the  contributions 
from all wires. Similarly, we may show that the magnetic field at a point below the plane 
points in the +y-direction.

We may now apply Ampere’s law to find the magnetic field due to the current sheet. The

magnetic  field  lines of a  solenoid carrying a  steady current  I. We  see  that  if  the  turns are 
closely  spaced,  the  resulting  magnetic  field  inside  the  solenoid  becomes  fairly  uniform, 

 

19

provided  that  the  length of  the  solenoid  is much greater  than  its diameter. For  an  “ideal” 
solenoid, which  is  infinitely  long with  turns  tightly  packed,  the magnetic  field  inside  the 
solenoid is uniform and parallel to the axis, and vanishes outside the solenoid.

We can use Ampere’s law to calculate the magnetic field strength inside an ideal solenoid.

we  consider  a  rectangular  path  of  length  l  and  width  w  and  traverse  the  path  in  a

One can think of a toroid as a solenoid wrapped around with its ends connected. Thus, the 
magnetic  field  is  completely  confined  inside  the  toroid  and  the  field  points  in  the 
azimuthal  direction  (clockwise  due  to  the  way  the  current  flows,  as  shown  in  Figure

9.5.1  Earth’s Magnetic Field at MIT 
 
The Earth’s field behaves as if there were a bar magnet in it. In Figure 9.5.2 an imaginary 
magnet  is  drawn  inside  the  Earth  oriented  to  produce  a  magnetic  field  like  that  of  the 
Earth’s magnetic  field. Note  the South pole of  such a magnet  in  the northern hemisphere 
in order to attract the North pole of a compass. 
 
It  is most  natural  to  represent  the  location  of  a  point  P  on  the  surface  of  the  Earth  using 
r θφ , where r  is  the distance from  the center of  the Earth, θ 
the spherical coordinates  ( ,
,
)
is  the polar  angle  from  the  z-axis, with  0 θ π≤ ≤ ,  and φ is  the  azimuthal  angle  in  the  xy 
plane,  measured  from  the  x-axis,  with    0
 (See  Figure  9.5.3.) With  the  distance 
2φ π
≤ ≤
θ 
r=
r
,  the  radius of  the Earth,    the point P  is parameterized by  the  two  angles
fixed  at 
E
and φ.

Figure 9.5.2 Magnetic field of the Earth  

 

 
In  practice,  a  location  on  Earth  is  described  by  two  numbers  –  latitude  and  longitude. 
How are  they related  to θ and φ?   The  latitude of a point, denoted as δ,  is a measure of 
the elevation from the plane of the equator. Thus, it is related to θ (commonly referred to 
90δ
° − .  Using  this  definition,  the  equator  has  latitude  0 ,  and 
as  the  colatitude)  by 
θ
=
°
90± ° , respectively.  
the north and the south poles have latitude 
 
The  longitude  of  a  location  is  simply  represented  by  the  azimuthal  angle  φ in  the 
spherical  coordinates. Lines  of  constant  longitude  are  generally  referred  to  as meridians.  
The value of  longitude depends on where  the counting begins. For historical  reasons,  the 
meridian  passing  through  the  Royal  Astronomical  Observatory  in  Greenwich,  UK,  is 
chosen as the “prime meridian” with zero longitude.

Animation 9.4: Bar Magnet in the Earth’s Magnetic Field 
 
Figure 9.5.4 shows a bar magnet and compass placed on a  table. The  interaction between 
the magnetic  field  of  the  bar magnet  and  the magnetic  field  of  the  earth  is  illustrated  by 
the  field  lines  that  extend  out  from  the  bar  magnet.  Field  lines  that  emerge  towards  the 
edges  of  the magnet  generally  reconnect  to  the magnet  near  the  opposite  pole. However, 
field  lines  that  emerge  near  the  poles  tend  to  wander  off  and  reconnect  to  the  magnetic 
field  of  the  earth,  which,  in  this  case,  is  approximately  a  constant  field  coming  at  60 
degrees  from  the  horizontal. Looking  at  the  compass,  one  can  see  that  a  compass  needle 
will  always  align  itself  in  the  direction  of  the  local  field.  In  this  case,  the  local  field  is 
dominated by the bar magnet.

9.6  Magnetic Materials  
 
The  introduction  of  material  media  into  the  study  of  magnetism  has  very  different 
consequences  as  compared  to  the  introduction  of  material  media  into  the  study  of 
electrostatics.   When  we  dealt  with  dielectric materials  in  electrostatics,  their  effect  was 
(cid:71)
always  to  reduce  E
below  what  it  would  otherwise  be,  for  a  given  amount  of  “free” 
electric  charge.    In  contrast,  when  we  deal  with  magnetic  materials,  their  effect  can  be 
one of the following: 
 
(cid:71)
(i)  reduce  B below  what  it  would  otherwise  be,  for  the  same  amount  of  "free"  electric 
current (diamagnetic  materials);  
 
(cid:71)
(ii) increase  B  a little above what it would otherwise be (paramagnetic  materials);  
 
(cid:71)
(iii) increase  B  a lot  above what it would otherwise be (ferromagnetic materials).   
 
Below we discuss how these effects arise.   
 
 
9.6.1  Magnetization  
 
Magnetic materials  consist  of many  permanent or  induced magnetic  dipoles.   One  of  the 
concepts crucial  to  the understanding of magnetic materials  is  the average magnetic  field 
produced  by many magnetic  dipoles which  are  all  aligned.    Suppose we  have  a  piece  of 
material in the form of a long cylinder with area  A  and height L, and that it consists of N 
(cid:71) , spread uniformly throughout the 
magnetic dipoles, each with magnetic dipole moment  µ
volume of the cylinder, as shown in Figure 9.6.1. 
 

 

27

 
 
Figure 9.6.1 A cylinder with N magnetic dipole moments 
 
(cid:71)
We  also  assume  that  all  of  the  magnetic  dipole  moments  µ
 are  aligned  with  the  axis  of 
the  cylinder.  In  the  absence of  any  external magnetic  field, what  is  the  average magnetic 
field due to these dipoles alone?    
 
To  answer  this  question,  we  note  that  each  magnetic  dipole  has  its  own  magnetic  field 
(cid:71)
associated with it.  Let’s define the magnetization vector  M
 to be the net magnetic dipole 
moment vector per unit volume:

(cid:71)

where V is  the volume.  In  the  case of our  cylinder, where  all  the dipoles  are  aligned,  the 
(cid:71)
magnitude of 
 is simply 
.  
M N
ALµ=
/
M
Now, what is the average magnetic field produced by all the dipoles in the cylinder?  
 

 
 
Figure  9.6.2  (a)  Top  view  of  the  cylinder  containing magnetic  dipole moments.  (b)  The 
equivalent current. 
 
Figure  9.6.2(a)  depicts  the  small  current  loops  associated  with  the  dipole  moments  and 
the  direction  of  the  currents,  as  seen  from  above.    We  see  that  in  the  interior,  currents 
flow  in  a  given  direction  will  be  cancelled  out  by  currents  flowing  in  the  opposite 
direction  in  neighboring  loops.  The  only  place where  cancellation  does  not  take  place  is 
near  the  edge  of  the  cylinder  where  there  are  no  adjacent  loops  further  out.  Thus,  the 
average  current  in  the  interior  of  the  cylinder  vanishes, whereas  the  sides  of  the  cylinder 
appear to carry a net current.  The equivalent situation is shown in Figure 9.6.2(b), where 
there is an equivalent current eqI on the sides. 

 

28

 
 may  be  deduced  by  requiring  that  the  magnetic  dipole 
The  functional  form  of 
eqI
 be the same as total magnetic dipole moment of the system. The 
moment produced by eqI
condition gives 
 
 
 
or 
 
 
Next,  let’s  calculate  the  magnetic  field  produced  by 
 running  on  the  sides, 
.  With 
eqI
eqI
the  equivalent  configuration  is  identical  to  a  solenoid  carrying  a  surface  current  (or 
current per unit length)  K . The two quantities are related by

Thus,  we  see  that  the  surface  current  K  is  equal  to  the  magnetization  M ,  which  is  the 
average magnetic dipole moment per unit volume.   The average magnetic  field produced 
by the equivalent current system is given by (see Section 9.4)

Since  the  direction  of  this  magnetic  field  is  in  the  same  direction  as  M ,  the  above 
expression may be written in vector notation as 
 
(cid:71)
(cid:71)
 
M
M µ=B
0
 
This  is  exactly  opposite  from  the  situation  with  electric  dipoles,  in  which  the  average 
electric field is anti-parallel to the direction of the electric dipoles themselves. The reason 
is  that  in  the  region  interior  to  the  current  loop  of  the  dipole,  the magnetic  field  is  in  the 
same  direction  as  the  magnetic  dipole  vector.    Therefore,  it  is  not  surprising  that  after  a 
large-scale  averaging,  the  average  magnetic  field  also  turns  out  to  be  parallel  to  the 
average magnetic dipole moment per unit volume.   
 
Notice  that  the magnetic field  in Eq. (9.6.6)  is  the average field due  to all  the dipoles.   A 
very different field is observed if we go close to any one of these little dipoles.  
 
Let’s now examine the properties of different magnetic materials

9.6.2  Paramagnetism 
 
The  atoms  or  molecules  comprising  paramagnetic  materials  have  a  permanent  magnetic 
dipole  moment.    Left  to  themselves,  the  permanent  magnetic  dipoles  in  a  paramagnetic 
material  never  line  up  spontaneously.    In  the  absence  of  any  applied  external  magnetic

9.6.4  Ferromagnetism 
 
In  ferromagnetic  materials,  there  is  a  strong  interaction  between  neighboring  atomic 
dipole moments.   Ferromagnetic materials  are made  up  of  small  patches  called  domains, 
(cid:71)
as  illustrated  in Figure  9.6.3(a). An  externally  applied  field 
 will  tend  to  line  up  those 
0B
magnetic  dipoles  parallel  to  the  external  field,  as  shown  in  Figure  9.6.3(b).  The  strong 
interaction  between  neighboring  atomic  dipole  moments  causes  a  much  stronger  
alignment of the magnetic dipoles than in paramagnetic materials.   
 

 

 

 
Figure  9.6.3  (a)  Ferromagnetic  domains.  (b)  Alignment  of  magnetic  moments  in  the 
(cid:71)

direction of the external field 
 
The  enhancement  of  the  applied  external  field  can  be  considerable,  with  the  total 
magnetic  field  inside  a  ferromagnet 10 or 
times  greater  than  the  applied  field.    The

of  a  ferromagnetic material  is not  a  constant,  since neither  the  total  field

Moreover,  in  ferromagnets,  the  strong  interaction  between  neighboring  atomic  dipole 
moments can keep  those dipole moments aligned, even when  the external magnet field  is 
reduced  to  zero.   And  these  aligned dipoles  can  thus produce  a  strong magnetic  field,  all 
by  themselves, without  the  necessity  of  an  external magnetic  field.    This  is  the  origin  of 
permanent  magnets.    To  see  how  strong  such  magnets  can  be,  consider  the  fact  that 
magnetic dipole moments of atoms typically have magnitudes of the order of

9.8  Appendix 1: Magnetic Field off the Symmetry Axis of a Current Loop   
 
In Example  9.2 we  calculated  the magnetic  field  due  to  a  circular  loop  of  radius R  lying 
in  the  xy  plane  and  carrying  a  steady  current  I,  at  a  point  P  along  the  axis  of  symmetry. 
Let’s  see  how  the  same  technique  can  be  extended  to  calculating  the  field  at  a  point  off 
the axis of symmetry in the yz plane.

Animation 9.5: Magnetic Field of the Helmholtz Coils  
 
The animation  in Figure 9.9.3(a) shows  the magnetic  field of  the Helmholtz coils.  In  this 
configuration  the  currents  in  the  top  and  bottom  coils  flow  in  the  same  direction,  with 
their  dipole moments  aligned.  The magnetic  fields  from  the  two  coils  add  up  to  create  a 
net  field  that  is  nearly  uniform  at  the  center  of  the  coils.  Since  the  distance  between  the 
coils  is  equal  to  the  radius  of  the  coils  and  remains  unchanged,  the  force  of  attraction 
between  them  creates  a  tension,  and  is  illustrated  by  field  lines  stretching  out  to  enclose 
both coils. When  the distance between  the coils  is not  fixed, as  in  the animation depicted 
in  Figure  9.9.3(b),  the  two  coils move  toward  each  other  due  to  their  force  of  attraction. 
In  this  animation,  the  top  loop  has  only  half  the  current  as  the  bottom  loop.    The  field 
configuration is shown using the “iron filings” representation.

Next, let’s consider the case where the currents in the loop flow in the opposite directions, 
as shown in Figure 9.9.4.

Animation 9.6: Magnetic Field of Two Coils Carrying Opposite Currents 
 
The  animation  depicted  in  Figure  9.9.6  shows  the  magnetic  field  of  two  coils  like  the 
Helmholtz  coils  but  with  currents  in  the  top  and  bottom  coils  flowing  in  the  opposite 
directions.  In  this  configuration,  the  magnetic  dipole  moments  associated  with  each  coil 
are anti-parallel.

 (b) 

 
Figure  9.9.6  (a) Magnetic  field  due  to  coils  carrying  currents  in  the  opposite  directions. 
(b)  Two  co-axial wire  loops  carrying  current  in  the  opposite  sense  repel  each  other.  The 
field configurations here are shown using the “iron filings” representation.  The bottom
wire loop carries twice the amount of current as the top wire loop.

 

42

At the center of the coils along the axis of symmetry, the magnetic field is zero. With the 
distance  between  the  two  coils  fixed,  the  repulsive  force  results  in  a  pressure  between 
them.  This  is  illustrated  by  field  lines  that  are  compressed  along  the  central  horizontal 
axis between the coils. 
 
Animation 9.7: Forces Between Coaxial Current-Carrying Wires 
 

 

 
Figure 9.9.7     A magnet in the TeachSpin ™ Magnetic Force apparatus when the current 
in the top coil is counterclockwise as seen from the top.  
 
Figure  9.9.7  shows  the  force  of  repulsion  between  the  magnetic  field  of  a  permanent 
magnet  and  the  field  of  a  current-carrying  ring  in  the  TeachSpin  ™  Magnetic  Force 
apparatus.  The magnet is forced to have its North magnetic pole pointing downward, and 
the  current  in  the  top  coil  of  the Magnetic  Force  apparatus  is moving  clockwise  as  seen 
from above.  The net result is a repulsion of the magnet when the current in this direction 
is  increased.   The visualization shows  the stresses  transmitted by  the  fields  to  the magnet 
when the current in the upper coil is increased.   
 
 
Animation 9.8:  Magnet Oscillating Between Two Coils 
 
Figure  9.9.8  illustrates  an  animation  in which  the magnetic  field  of  a  permanent magnet 
suspended by a spring  in  the TeachSpinTM apparatus  (see TeachSpin visualization), plus 
the magnetic  field due  to  current  in  the  two  coils  (here we  see  a  "cutaway"  cross-section 
of the apparatus).  
 

 

Figure 9.9.8 Magnet oscillating between two coils 

43

 

 
The magnet  is  fixed  so  that  its north pole points upward, and  the current  in  the  two coils 
is  sinusoidal and 180 degrees out of phase. When  the effective dipole moment of  the  top 
coil  points  upwards,  the  dipole moment  of  the  bottom  coil  points  downwards.  Thus,  the 
magnet  is  attracted  to  the  upper  coil  and  repelled  by  the  lower  coil,  causing  it  to  move 
upwards.  When  the  conditions  are  reversed  during  the  second  half  of  the  cycle,  the 
magnet moves downwards. 
 
This  process  can  also  be  described  in  terms  of  tension  along,  and  pressure  perpendicular 
to,  the  field  lines  of  the  resulting  field.  When  the  dipole  moment  of  one  of  the  coils  is 
aligned with  that of  the magnet,  there  is a  tension along  the  field  lines as  they attempt  to 
"connect" the coil and magnet. Conversely, when their moments are anti-aligned, there is 
a pressure perpendicular to the field lines as they try to keep the coil and magnet apart. 
 
 
Animation 9.9: Magnet Suspended Between Two Coils 
 
Figure  9.9.9  illustrates  an  animation  in which  the magnetic  field  of  a  permanent magnet 
suspended by a spring  in  the TeachSpinTM apparatus  (see TeachSpin visualization), plus 
the magnetic  field due  to  current  in  the  two  coils  (here we  see  a  "cutaway"  cross-section 
of  the  apparatus).  The  magnet  is  fixed  so  that  its  north  pole  points  upward,  and  the 
current  in  the  two  coils  is  sinusoidal  and  in  phase. When  the  effective  dipole moment  of 
the top coil points upwards, the dipole moment of the bottom coil points upwards as well. 
Thus,  the magnet  the magnet  is  attracted  to  both  coils,  and  as  a  result  feels  no  net  force 
(although  it  does  feel  a  torque,  not  shown  here  since  the  direction  of  the magnet  is  fixed 
to  point  upwards). When  the  dipole  moments  are  reversed  during  the  second  half  of  the 
cycle, the magnet is repelled by both coils, again resulting in no net force. 
 
This  process  can  also  be  described  in  terms  of  tension  along,  and  pressure  perpendicular 
to,  the  field  lines  of  the  resulting  field. When  the  dipole  moment  of  the  coils  is  aligned 
with  that  of  the magnet,  there  is  a  tension  along  the  field  lines  as  they  are  "pulled"  from 
both  sides.  Conversely,  when  their  moments  are  anti-aligned,  there  is  a  pressure 
perpendicular to the field lines as they are "squeezed" from both sides.

9.10  Problem-Solving Strategies 
 
In  this  Chapter,  we  have  seen  how  Biot-Savart  and  Ampere’s  laws  can  be  used  to 
calculate magnetic field due to a current source.  
 
 
9.10.1  Biot-Savart Law: 
 
The  law  states  that  the magnetic  field  at  a point P due  to  a  length  element 
steady current I located at  (cid:71)  away is given by

The calculation of the magnetic field may be carried out as follows: 
 
(1) Source point: Choose an appropriate coordinate system and write down an expression

(cid:71) . 
(cid:71) describing the position of I d s

“prime” are used for the source point.  
 
(2) Field point: The field point P is the point in space where the magnetic field due to the 
current distribution is to be calculated. Using the same coordinate system, write down the 
(cid:71) for  the  field  point  P.  The  quantity 
(cid:71)
r = r
is  the  distance  between  the

origin and P. 
 
(3) Relative  position  vector: The  relative  position  between  the  source  point  and  the  field

9.11.1  Magnetic Field of a Straight Wire 
 
Consider  a  straight  wire  of  length  L  carrying  a  current  I  along  the  +x-direction,  as 
shown in Figure 9.11.1 (ignore the return path of the current or the source for the current.) 
What is the magnetic field at an arbitrary point P on the xy-plane?  
 

 
 
Figure 9.11.1 A finite straight wire carrying a current I.  

 
Solution: 
 
The problem  is very similar  to Example 9.1. However, now  the  field point  is an arbitrary 
point  in  the  xy-plane.  Once  again  we  solve  the  problem  using  the methodology  outlined 
in Section 9.10. 
 
(1) Source point 
 
From  Figure  9.10.1,  we  see  that  the  infinitesimal  length  dx′  described  by  the  position

field  in  the  vicinity  of  a  single  infinitely  long  wire.  Adding  more  wires  with  differing 
currents will check your understanding of Ampere's law.

symmetry. What is the field at a distance of 10 mm from the wire if the current is 10 A?

(e)  One  of  the  reasons  this  model  is  “semi-classical”  is  because  classically  there  is  no 
reason  for  the  radius of  the orbit above  to assume  the  specific value we have given.   The 
value  of  r  is  determined  from  quantum mechanical  considerations,  to wit  that  the  orbital

(a) A  3000-turn  solenoid  has  a  length  of  60  cm  and  a  diameter  of  8  cm.    If  this  solenoid 
carries a current of 5.0 A, find the magnitude of the magnetic field inside the solenoid by 
constructing  an Amperian  loop  and  applying Ampere's  Law.   How  does  this  compare  to 
the magnetic  field  of  the  earth  (0.5  gauss).    [Ans:    0.0314  T,  or  314  gauss,  or  about  600
