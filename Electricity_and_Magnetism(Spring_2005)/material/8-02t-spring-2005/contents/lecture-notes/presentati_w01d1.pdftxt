Why Study Physics?

Understand/appreciate nature
• Lightning
• Soap Films
• Butterfly Wings
• Sunsets

Why Study Physics?
Electromagnetic phenomena 
led directly to Einstein’s 
discovery of the nature of 
space and time, see his 
paper 
ON THE 
ELECTRODYNAMICS
OF MOVING BODIES
A. Einstein June 30, 1905
In the last class of the term before the review, 
we will explain to you how this comes about

Why Study Physics?

• Understand/Appreciate Nature
• Understand Technology
§ Electric Guitar
§ Ground Fault Interrupts
§ Microwave Ovens
§ Radio Towers

Why Study Physics?

• Understand/Appreciate Nature
• Understand Technology
• Learn to Solve Difficult Problems
• It’s Required

Why The TEAL/Studio Format?
Problems with Large Lectures:
Lecture/recitations are passive
No labs (cid:198) lack of physical intuition 
E&M is abstract, hard to visualize
TEAL/Studio Addresses Problems:
Lectures (cid:198) Interactive, Collaborative Learning
Incorporates desk top experiments
Incorporates visualization/simulations
Bottom Line:  Learn More, Retain More, Do Better

Why The TEAL/Studio Format?

By standard assessment measures, 
TEAL shows a factor of two increase 
in learning gains as compared to 
lecture/recitation format
(see Dori and Belcher, “How Does TEAL 
Affect Student Learning of E&M 
Concepts?”, Journal of the Learning 
Sciences 14(2) 2004.)  
Bottom Line:  Learn More, Retain More, Do Better

Problem Sets: 
Please work together BUT 
Submit your own, uncopied work
In Class Assignments:
Must sign your own name to submitted work
Signing another’s name is COD offense
PRS:
Use only your assigned PRS
Using another’s PRS is COD offense

Don’t Worry!

• For many this is new & I will introduce 
concepts before use (yell at me if not!)
• Concepts are VERY important –
mechanics are almost trivial

So what physics do we learn in 
8.02 anyway????

What’s the Physics?
8.01:  Intro. to basic physics concepts: 
motion, force, energy, …

How does matter interact?
Four Fundamental Forces:
Long range:  Gravity (8.01 … Gen.Relativity)
Short Range: Strong and Weak
Mid Range: Electromagnetic (8.02)

P01 -

24

8.02: Electricity and Magnetism
Also new way of thinking…
How do objects interact at a distance?  
Fields We will learn about E & M Fields:  
how they are created & what they effect

Scalar Fields

e.g. Temperature:  Every location has 
associated value (number with units)

P01 -

27

Scalar Fields - Contours

• Colors represent surface temperature
• Contour lines show constant temperatures

Fields are 3D

• T = T(x,y,z)
• Hard to visualize 
(cid:198) Work in 2D

Arrows (different colors or length) in direction of field 
on uniform grid.
Field Lines
Lines tangent to field at every point along line
Grass Seeds
Textures with streaks parallel to field direction

Vector Fields – Field Lines

• Direction of field line at any point is 
tangent to field at that point
• Field lines never cross each other
