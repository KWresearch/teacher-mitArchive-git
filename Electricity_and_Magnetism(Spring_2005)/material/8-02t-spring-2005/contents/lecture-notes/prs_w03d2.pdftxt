A point charge +Q is 
placed at the center of 
the conductors.  The 
induced charges are: 

1.  Q(I1) = Q(I2) = -Q; 
Q(O1) = Q(O2)= +Q 

2.  	 Q(I1) = Q(I2) = +Q; 
Q(O1) = Q(O2)= -Q 

3. 	 Q(I1) = -Q;  Q(O1) = +Q 
Q(I2) = Q(O2)= 0 

4. 	 Q(I1) = -Q;  Q(O2)= +Q 
Q(O1) = Q(I2)= 0

Hollow Conductors


(1)  The inner faces are negative, 
the outer faces are positive. 

Looking in from each conductor, 
the total charge must be zero (this 
gives the inner surfaces as –Q).  But 
the conductors must remain neutral 
(which makes the outer surfaces 
have induced charge +Q).

A point charge +Q is 
placed at the center of 
the conductors.  The 
potential at O1 is: 

1.  Higher than at I1  


2.  Lower than at I1  


3.  The same as at I1

A conductor is an 
equipotential surface. 
O1 and I1 are on the 
same conductor, hence 
at the same potential

As you move away 
from the positive point 
charge at the center, the 
potential decreases.

A point charge +Q is 
placed at the center of 
the conductors.  If a wire 
is used to connect the 
two conductors, then 
positive charge will flow 

1.  From the inner to the outer conductor  


2.  From the outer to the inner conductor  


3.  Not at all 

PRS08 

Hollow Conductors 

(1)  Positive charge flows outward 

Positive charges always flow “downhill”  

– from high to low potential.  Since the 
inner conductor is at a higher potential 
the charges will flow from the inner to 
the outer conductor.

Capacitor Circuit

Three  	 identical capacitors are connected  

to a battery as pictured. 

The battery is then 

disconnected.

How do the charge on 
A, B & C compare 
before and after the 
battery is removed? 

A 

B 

C  	

AFTER 
BEFORE; 
1.  QA	 = QB = QC;  No Change 
2.  QA	 = QB = QC;  QA > QB = QC

3.  QA	 = QB = QC;  QA < QB = QC

4.  QA	 > QB = QC;  No Change 
5.  QA	 > QB = QC;  QA = QB = QC

6.  QA	 < QB = QC;  No Change 
7.  QA	 < QB = QC;  QA = QB = QC

4.  QA > QB = QC;  No Change

B 

C

The potential drop across A is the same 
as the sum of the potential drops across B 
& C.  By symmetry VB=VC, so 

VA > VB=VC


Since Q = CV, QA > QB = QC.  When the 
battery is disconnected there is no reason 
for the potential to change or charge to 
flow so it doesn’t.

Dielectric in a Capacitor


A parallel plate capacitor is charged to a 
total charge Q and the battery removed. 
A slab of material with dielectric 
constant κ is inserted between the plates. 
The charge stored in the capacitor 

1.  Increases 
2.  Decreases 
3.  Stays the Same

(3) The charge is unchanged 

Since the capacitor is disconnected 
from a battery there is no way for 
the amount of charge on it to 
change.

(2) The energy stored decreases 

The dielectric reduces the electric 
field and hence reduces the amount 
of energy stored in the field.

A slab of material with dielectric 
constant κ is inserted between the plates. 
The force on the dielectric 

1.  pulls in the dielectric 
2.  pushes out the dielectric 

3.  is zero

Dielectric in a Capacitor 


(1) The dielectric is pulled into the 
capacitor 

We just saw that the energy is 
reduced by the introduction of a 
dielectric.  Since systems want to 
reduce their energy, the dielectric 
will be sucked into the capacitor. 

Alternatively, since opposing 
charges are induced on the 
dielectric surfaces close to the 
plates, the attraction between these 
will lead to the attractive force.
