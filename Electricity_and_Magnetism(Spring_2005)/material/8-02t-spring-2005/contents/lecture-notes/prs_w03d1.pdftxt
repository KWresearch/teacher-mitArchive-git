Walking Down a Mountain

(1) Start off going North 

N

The fastest way downhill (or 
uphill) is always to walk 
perpendicular to contours of 
constant height.  From the 
peak the fastest way down is 
NW, but from here it is N.

Changing C Dimensions 
A parallel-plate capacitor has plates 
with equal and opposite charges ±Q, 
separated by a distance d, and is not 
connected to a battery.  The plates 
are pulled apart to a distance D > d. 
What happens to the potential 
difference V and the charge Q? 
1.  V increases,  Q increases 
2.  V decreases,  Q increases 
3.  V is the same, Q increases 
4.  V increases,  Q is the same 

5.  V decreases,  Q is the same 

6.  V is the same, Q is the same 

7.  V increases,  Q decreases 
8.  V decreases,  Q decreases 
9.  V is the same, Q decreases

(4) V Increases, Q remains the same 
 
With no battery connected to the 
plates the charge on them has no 
possibility of changing. 
 
In this situation, the electric field 
doesn’t change when you change 
the distance between the plates, so: 
 

V = E d 

 
As d increases, V increases.

(9) V is the same, Q decreases 
 
With no battery connected to the 
plates the potential V between them 
is held constant 
 
In this situation, since 
 

V = E d 

 
As d increases, E must decrease.
 
Since the electric field is 
proportional to the charge on the 
plates, Q must decrease as well.

A parallel-plate capacitor, 
disconnected from a battery, has 
plates with equal and opposite 
charges, separated by a distance d. 
Suppose the plates are pulled apart 
until separated by a distance D > d. 
How does the final electrostatic 
energy stored in the capacitor 
compare to the initial energy? 

1. The final stored energy is smaller 
2. The final stored energy is larger 
3. Stored energy does not change.

Changing C Dimensions 

(2)  The stored energy increases 


As you pull apart the capacitor 
plates you are increasing the 
amount of space in which the E 
field is non-zero and hence increase 
the stored energy.  Where does the 
extra energy come from?  From the 
work you do pulling the plates 
apart.
