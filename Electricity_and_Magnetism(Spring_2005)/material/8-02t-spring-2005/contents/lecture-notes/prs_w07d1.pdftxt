Parallel Wires

Consider two  

parallel current 

carrying wires.

I2  With the currents 
running in the 
same direction, 
the wires are 

I1 


1. attracted (likes attract?)  

2. repelled (likes repel?) 
3. pushed in another 
direction 
4. not pushed – no net force

I1 

Parallel Wires 
(1)  Wires attracted 
X 
I2  	 I1 creates a field 
into the page at I2. 
That makes a force 
to the left. 

I2 creates a field out of the 
page at I1.  That makes a 
force to the right.

Dipole in Field 
µ 

The coil above will: 
1.  rotate clockwise, not move 
2.  rotate countercw, not move 
3.  move to the right, no rotation 

4.  move to the left, no rotation 

5.  move in another direction, 
without rotation 
6.  move and rotate 

7.  no net force so no rotation or 
motion

(1)  Coil will rotate clockwise 


No net force so no center of 
mass motion.  BUT Magnetic 
dipoles rotate to align with 
external field!

Dipole in Field 

The current carrying coil 
above will move 
1. upwards 
2. downwards 

3. stay where it is because  

the total force is zero

(2)  Coil will move down 


The I ds x B forces shown 
produce a net downward 
force

Free dipoles attract because: 

1. The force between dipoles 
is always attractive 
independent of orientation. 
2. A dipole will always move 
towards stronger field, 
independent of orientation. 
3. The torque on the dipole 
aligns it with the local field 
and the dipole will then 
move toward stronger field 
strength.

(3) Free dipoles attract 
because the torque on a 
dipole aligns the dipole with 
the local field and the dipole 
then moves toward stronger 
field strength—that is closer 
to another dipole.  If the 
dipole were anti-aligned with 
the local field then it would 
move toward regions of 
weaker field strength.
