4.1  Electric Flux 
 
In Chapter 2 we showed that the strength of an electric field is proportional to the number 
of field lines per area.  The number of electric field lines that penetrates a given surface is 
called  an  “electric  flux,”  which  we  denote  as 
EΦ .  The  electric  field  can  therefore  be 
thought of as the number of lines per unit area.

In  general,  a  surface  S  can be  curved  and  the  electric  field  E
 may vary over  the  surface. 
We  shall  be  interested  in  the  case  where  the  surface  is  closed.  A  closed  surface  is  a 
surface  which  completely  encloses  a  volume.  In  order  to  compute  the  electric  flux,  we

In  the  above, we  have  chosen  a  sphere  to  be  the Gaussian  surface. However,  it  turns  out 
that  the  shape  of  the  closed  surface  can  be  arbitrarily  chosen.  For  the  surfaces  shown  in

The  statement  that  the  net  flux  through  any  closed  surface  is  proportional  to  the  net 
charge enclosed is known as Gauss’s law. Mathematically, Gauss’s law is expressed as

where 
holds  is due  to note  that  the number of  field  lines  that  leave  the charge  is  independent of 
the shape of the imaginary Gaussian surface we choose to enclose the charge.

Thus,  we  see  that  the  electric  flux  through  any  area  element  subtending  the  same  solid 
angle is constant, independent of the shape or orientation of the surface. 
  
In  summary,  Gauss’s  law  provides  a  convenient  tool  for  evaluating  electric  field. 
However,  its  application  is  limited  only  to  systems

An  insulator  such  as  glass  or  paper  is  a material  in which  electrons  are  attached  to  some 
particular atoms and cannot move freely. On the other hand, inside a conductor, electrons 
are free to move around. The basic properties of a conductor are the following:

Example 4.5: Conductor with Charge Inside a Cavity

Consider  a  hollow  conductor  shown  in  Figure  4.3.5  below.  Suppose  the  net  charge 
carried by  the  conductor  is +Q.  In addition,  there  is a charge q  inside  the  cavity. What  is 
the charge on the outer surface of the conductor?

Since  the  electric  field  inside  a  conductor  must  be  zero,  the  net  charge  enclosed  by  the 
aussian  surface  shown  in Figure 4.3.5 must be zero. This  implies  that a charge –q must

4.6 Appendix: Tensions and Pressures 
 
In Section  4.4,  the  pressure  transmitted  by  the  electric  field  on  a  conducting  surface was 
derived. We now consider a more general case where a closed surface (an imaginary box) 
is placed in an electric field, as shown in Figure 4.6.1.  
 
If  we  look  at  the  top  face  of  the  imaginary  box,  there  is  an  electric  field  pointing  in  the 
at face. From Faraday’s field theory perspective, we would 
utward normal direction of th
o
ay  that  the  field  on  that  face  transmits  a  tension  along  itself  across  the  face,  thereby 
s
resulting  in  an  upward  pull,  just  as  if we  had  attached  a  string  under  tension  to  that  face 
to pull it upward.   Similarly, if we look at the bottom face of the imaginary box, the field 
on that face is anti-parallel to the outward normal of the face, and according to Faraday’s 
interpretation,  we  would  again  say  that  the  field  on  the  bottom  face  transmits  a  tension 
along  itself,  giving  rise  to  a  downward  pull,  just  as  if  a  string  has  been  attached  to  that 
face  to pull  it downward.   (The actual determination of  the direction of  the force requires 
an advanced  treatment using  the Maxwell’s stress  tensor.) Note  that  this  is a pull parallel 
to  the  outward  normal  of  the  bottom  face,  regardless  of  whether  the  field  is  into  the 
surface or out of the surface.  
 

 
Figure  4.6.1  An  imaginary  box  in  an  electric  field  (long  orange  vectors).    The  short 
vectors indicate the directions of stresses transmitted by the field, either pressures (on the 
left or right faces of the box) or tensions (on the top and bottom faces of the box). 
 
For  the  left  side  of  the  imaginary  box,  the  field  on  that  face  is  perpendicular  to  the 
outward  normal  of  that  face,  and  Faraday  would  have  said  that  the  field  on  that  face 
transmits a pressure perpendicular to itself, causing a push to the right.   Similarly, for the 
right  side  of 
the  imaginary  box,  the  field  on  that  face  is  perpendicular  to  the  outward 
ormal of the face, and the field would transmit a pressure perpendicular to itself.  In this 
n
case, there is a push to the left.   
 

 

24

Note that the term “tension” is used when the stress transmitted by the field is parallel (or 
anti-parallel)  to  the  outward  normal  of  the  surface,  and  “pressure”  when  it  is 
  tensions  on 
perpendicular  to  the  outward  normal.   The magnitude  of  these  pressures  and
 
for  the 
e  various  faces  of  the  imaginary  surface  in  Figure  4.6.1  is  given  by 
th

electric  field.    This  quantity  has  units  of  force  per  unit  area,  or  pressure.    It  is  also  the 
energy density stored in the electric field since energy per unit volume h

e same units 
as pressure.

negative  z-axis.    (b)  The  total  field  configuration  when  the  charge  comes  to  rest  at  the 
origin, before it moves back down the negative z-axis.   
 
How  do we  interpret  the motion  of  the  charge  in  terms  of  the  stresses  transmitted  by  the 
fields?    Faraday  would  have  described  the  downward  force  on  the  charge  in  Figure 
4.6.2(b)  as  follows: Let  the  charge  be  surrounded  by  an  imaginary  sphere  centered  on  it, 
as  shown  in  Figure  4.6.3. The  field  lines  piercing  the  lower  half  of  the  sphere  transmit  a 
tension  that  is  parallel  to  the  field. This  is  a  stress  pulling  downward  on  the  charge  from 
below.  The  field  lines  draped  over  the  top  of  the  imaginary  sphere  transmit  a  pressure 
perpendicular to themselves. This is a stress pushing down on the charge from above. The 
total effect of these stresses is a net downward force on the charge.  

 

25

 

 

 
Figure  4.6.3  An  electric  charge  in  a  constant  downward  electric  field.   We  surround  the 
charge  by  an  imaginary  sphere  in  order  to  discuss  the  stresses  transmitted  across  the 
surface of that sphere by the electric field. 
 
Viewing  the  animation  of  Figure  4.6.2  greatly  enhances  Faraday’s  interpretation  of  the 
stresses  in  the static  image.   As  the charge moves upward,  it  is apparent  in  the animation 
that  the  electric  field  lines  are  generally  compressed  above  the  charge  and  stretched 
below  the  charge. This  field  configuration  enables  the  transmission of  a downward  force 
to  the moving  charge we  can  see  as well  as  an  upward  force  to  the  charges  that  produce 
the constant  field, which we cannot see. The overall appearance of  the upward motion of 
the  charge  through  the  electric  field  is  that  of  a  point  being  forced  into  a  resisting 
edium
m
, with stresses arising in that medium as a result of that encroachment.  
 
The  kinetic  energy  of  the  upwardly  moving  charge  is  decreasing  as  more  and  more 
energy  is  stored  in  the  compressed  electrostatic  field,  and  conversely when  the  charge  is 
moving  downward.  Moreover,  because  the  field  line  motion  in  the  animation  is  in  the 
direction of  the energy  flow, we can explicitly see  the electromagnetic energy  flow away 
from  the  charge  into  the  surrounding  field  when  the  charge  is  slowing.  Conversely,  we 
see  the  electromagnetic  energy  flow  back  to  the  charge  from  the  surrounding  field when 
the  charge  is  being  accelerated  back  down  the  z-axis  by  the  energy  released  from  the 
fi
eld. 
 
Finally,  consider  momentum  conservation.    The  moving  charge  in 
the  animation  of 
igure 4.6.2 completely reverses its direction of motion over the course of the anim
ation. 
F
How  do  we  conserve  momentum  in  this  process?    Momentum  is  conserved  because 
momentum  in  the  positive  z-direction  is  transmitted  from  the  moving  charge  to  the 
charges  that  are  generating  the  constant  downward  electric  field  (not  shown).      This  is 
bvious  from  the  field  configuration  shown  in  Figure  4.6.3.    The  field  stress,  which 
o
pushes  downward  on  the  charge,  is  accom
panied  by  a  stress  pushing  upward  on  the 
harges generating the constant field.

Animation 4.2: Charged Particle at Rest in a Time-Varying Field 
 
As  a  second  example  of  the  stresses  transmitted  by  electric  fields,  consider  a  positive 
point charge sitting at rest at  the origin  in an external field which  is constant  in space but 
varies in time.  This external field is uniform varies according to the equation

sitting  at  rest  in  a  time-changing  electric  field  that  points  downward.   The  orange  vector 
is the electric field and the white vector is the force on the point charge.   
 
Figure 4.6.4 shows two frames of an animation of the total electric field configuration for 
this  situation.    Figure  4.6.4(a)  is  at  t =  0, when  the  vertical  electric  field  is  zero.    Frame

Animation 4.3: Like and Unlike Charges Hanging from Pendulums 
Consider  two  charges  hanging  from  pendulums  whose  supports  can  be  moved  closer  or 
fu

and therefore repel.

Figure 4.6.5 Two pendulums from which are suspended charges of the same sign.   
 
Figure 4.6.5  shows  the  situation when an external agent  tries  to move  the  supports  (from 
which  the  two  positive  charges  are  suspended)  together.    The  force  of  gravity  is  pulling 
the  charges  down,  and  the  force  of  electrostatic  repulsion  is  pushing  them  apart  on  the 
radial line joining them.  The behavior of the electric fields in this situation is an example 
of  an  electrostatic  pressure  transmitted  perpendicular  to  the  field.    That  pressure  tries  to 
keep  the  two  charges  apart  in  this  situation,  as  the  external  agent  controlling  the 
pendulum supports tries to move them together. When we move the supports together the 
charges  are  pushed  apart  by  the  pressure  transmitted  perpendicular  to  the  electric  field.  
We  artificially  terminate  the  field  lines  at  a  fixed  distance  from  the  charges  to  avoid 
visual confusion.   
 
In contrast,  suppose  the charges are of opposite signs, and  therefore attract.   Figure 4.6.6 
shows  the  situation  when  an  external  agent  moves  the  supports  (from  which  the  two 
positive  charges  are  suspended)  together.    The  force  of  gravity  is  pulling  the  charges 
down,  and  the  force  of  electrostatic  attraction  is  pulling  them  together  on  the  radial  line

4.8.1  Two Parallel Infinite Non-Conducting Planes  
 
Two  parallel  infinite  non-conducting  planes  lying  in  the  xy-plane  are  separated  by  a 
d
distance 
.  Each  plane  is  uniformly  charged  with  equal  but  opposite  surface  charge 
densities, as shown in Figure 4.8.1. Find the electric field everywhere in space. 
 

 
Figure 4.8.1 Positive and negative uniformly charged infinite planes 

 
Solution: 
 
The  electric  field  due  to  the  two  planes  can  be  found  by  applying  the  superposition 
principle to the result obtained in Example 4.2 for one plane. Since the planes carry equal 
but opposite surface charge densities, both fields have equal magnitude:

Therefore,  when  we  add  these  fields  together,  we  see  that  the  field  outside  the  parallel 
planes  is  zero,  and  the  field  between  the  planes  has  twice  the  magnitude  of  the  field  of 
either plane.

Conceptual Questions 

4.9 
 
1.  If  the  electric  field  in  some  region  of  space  is  zero,  does  it  imply  that  there  is  no 
electric charge in that region?   

 
2.  Consider  the  electric  field  due  to  a  non-conducting  infinite  plane  having  a  uniform 
charge density.   Why  is  the electric  field  independent of  the distance  from  the plane?  
Explain in terms of the spacing of the electric field lines. 

 
3.  If  we  place  a  point  charge  inside  a  hollow  sealed  conducting  pipe,  describe  the 
electric field outside the pipe. 

.  The 

 
4.  Consider  two  isolated  spherical  conductors  each  having  net  charge

spheres have radii a and b, where b>a. Which sphere has the higher potential?  

 
 
4.10  Additional Problems 
 
4.10.1  Non-Conducting Solid Sphere with a Cavity 
 
A  sphere  of  radius  2R  is  made  of  a  non-conducting  material  that  has  a  uniform  volume 
charge  density  ρ.  (Assume  that  the  material  does  not  affect  the  electric  field.)    A 
spherical  cavity  of  radius  R  is  then  carved  out  from  the  sphere,  as  shown  in  the  figure 
below. Compute the electric field within the cavity.

4.10.2  P-N Junction 
 
When  two  slabs  of  N-type  and  P-type  semiconductors  are  put  in  contact,  the  relative 
affinities of  the materials cause electrons  to migrate out of  the N-type material across  the 
junction to the P-type material. This leaves behind a volume in the N-type material that is 
positively charged and creates a negatively charged volume in the P-type material.
