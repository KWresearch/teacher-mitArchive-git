Conductors and Insulators

A conductor contains charges that are free to 
move (electrons are weakly bound to atoms)
Example: metals

An insulator contains charges that are NOT free to 
move (electrons are strongly bound to atoms)
Examples: plastic, paper, wood

Conductors
Conductors have free charges
(cid:198) E must be zero inside the conductor
(cid:198) Conductors are equipotential objects

Properties of Equipotentials

• E field lines point from high to low potential
• E field lines perpendicular to equipotentials
• Have no component along equipotential
• No work to move along equipotential

P07 -

Conductors in Equilibrium

Conductors are equipotential objects:
1) E = 0 inside
2) Net charge inside is 0
3) E perpendicular to surface 
4) Excess charge on surface

13

Conductors in Equilibrium
Put a net positive charge anywhere inside a 
conductor, and it will move to the surface 
to get as far away as possible from the 
other charges of like sign.

Capacitor: two isolated conductors with equal and 
opposite charges Q and potential difference ∆V 
between them.

Parallel Plate Capacitor
When you put opposite charges on plates, charges 
move to the inner surfaces of the plates to get as 
close as possible to charges of the opposite sign

1. Capacitor starts uncharged.
2. Carry +dq from bottom to top.  
Now top has charge q = +dq, bottom -dq
3. Repeat
4. Finish when top has charge q = +Q, bottom -Q
