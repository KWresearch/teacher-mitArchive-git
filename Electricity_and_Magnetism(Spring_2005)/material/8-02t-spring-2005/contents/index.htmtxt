[Magnet levitating above a superconducting ring.]
Magnet Levitating Above A Superconducting Ring: The image shows a permanent
magnet levitating above a conducting non-magnetic ring with zero resistance.
The magnet is levitated by eddy currents induced in the ring by the approaching
magnet. These currents are always such as to repel the magnet, by Lenz Law.

***** Course Description *****
This freshman-level course is the second semester of introductory physics. The
focus is on electricity and magnetism. The subject is taught using the TEAL
(Technology Enabled Active Learning) format which utilizes small group
interaction and current technology. The TEAL/Studio Project at MIT is a new
approach to physics education designed to help students develop much better
intuition about, and conceptual models of, physical phenomena.
Â 
OpenCourseWare presents another version of 8.02:_Electricity_and_Magnetism_
(Spring_2002)_with_Professor_Walter_Lewin, which includes 36 videotaped
lectures.
