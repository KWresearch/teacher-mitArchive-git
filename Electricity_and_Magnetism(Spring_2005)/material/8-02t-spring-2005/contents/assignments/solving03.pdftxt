Problem Solving 3: Calculating the Electric Field of Highly Symmetric 
Distributions of Charge Using Gauss’s Law 

REFERENCE:  Section 4.2, 8.02 Course Notes. 

Introduction 

When approaching Gauss’s Law problems, we described a problem solving strategy summarized 
below (see also, Section 4.7, 8.02 Course Notes): 

Summary: Methodology for Applying Gauss’s Law 

Step 1: Identify the ‘symmetry’ properties of the charge distribution. 

Step 2: Determine the direction of the electric field, and a surface on which the magnitude of 
the electric field is constant. 


Step 3: Decide how many different regions of space the charge distribution determines 


Step  4:  For  each  region  of  space,  choose  the  Gaussian  surface  such  that  the  flux  integral  is  

either case a) or case b) above. 


Step 5: Calculate the flux through the Gaussian surface. 


Step  6: For each region of space, calculate the charge enclosed in the choice of the Gaussian  

surface for that region.  


Step  7:  For  each  region  of  space,  equate  the  two  sides  of  Gauss’s  Law  in  order  to  find  an  

expression for the magnitude of the electric field in that region of space. 


Step  8:  Graph  the  magnitude  of  the  electric  field  as  a  function  of  the  parameter  specifying  

the Gaussian surface for all regions of space. 

You should now apply this strategy to the following problem.

Question: Concentric Cylinders

non-conducting  cylinder of  radius  a  and  length L with  b
