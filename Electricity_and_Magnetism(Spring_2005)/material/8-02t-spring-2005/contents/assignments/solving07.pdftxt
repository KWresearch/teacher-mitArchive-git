Problem-Solving Strategy for Faraday’s Law 

In  Chapter  10  of  the  8.02  Course  Notes,  we  have  seen  that  a  changing  magnetic  flux 
induces an emf: 

ε= − N 

dΦ B
dt 

according  to  Faraday’s  law  of  induction.  For  a  conductor  that  forms  a  closed  loop,  the 
emf  sets  up  an  induced  current  I  = ε  / R ,  where  R is  the  resistance  of  the  loop.  To

compute the induced current and its direction, we follow the procedure below:

(i)  changing the magnetic field  dB  dt ≠ 0 ,

(ii)  changing the loop area if the conductor is moving ( dA  dt ≠ 0 ), or

(iii)  changing  the  orientation  of  the  loop  with  respect  to  the  magnetic  field

(3)  The  sign  of  the  induced  emf  is  opposite  the  sign  of  d Φ B  / dt
.  The  direction  of  the 
induced current can be found by using the Lenz’s law discussed in Section 10.2.2.  

Example:  A Falling Loop 

A  rectangular  loop  of  wire  with  mass  m, 
width  w,  vertical  length  l,  and  resistance  R 
falls  out  of  a  magnetic  field  under  the 
influence  of  gravity.  The magnetic  field  is 
uniform  and  out  of  the  paper  (B  =  Bx ^  ) 
within the area shown (see sketch) and zero 
outside  of  that  area.  At  the  time  shown  in 
the  sketch,  the  loop  is  exiting  the magnetic

( )  zˆ  , where  V t ) < 0 
field at speed  V ( )  = V

(
(meaning  the  loop  is  moving  downward, 
not upward).  Suppose at time t the distance 
from  the  top  of  the  loop  to  the  point where 
the magnetic field goes to zero is z(t) (see sketch).    

Question  1  (write  your  answer  on  the  tear-off  sheet  at  the  end!!!):    What  is  the  
relationship between  V t )  and  z t ) ?    Be careful of you signs here, remember that  z t )

Question 2:
     If we define  the area vector 
to be  out of  the page, what  is  the magnetic 
flux  Φ B    through  our  circuit  at  time  t?  Be  careful,  because  the  magnetic  field  is  not 
uniform  across  the  entire  area  of  the  loop!  (it  is  zero  over  some  parts  and  constant  and 
non-zero over other  parts).

Question  3:     What  is   d Φ B  / dt
?  Is  this  positive  or  negative  at  time  t?  Be  careful  here, 
 
( ) , and remember that V t  < 0 . 
your answer should involve V t

Problem Solving Strategy Step (3):  Determine the sign of the induced emf (the same 
                                            as the direction of the induced current) 

Question  4:      If   d Φ B  / dt
 
< 0   then  your  induced  emf  (and  current)  will  be  right-handed 
G 
with  respect  to  A ,  and  vice  versa.  What  is  the  direction  of  your  induced  current  given 
your answer to Question 3, clockwise or counterclockwise? 

Question 5:   Lenz’s Law says that the induced current should be such as to create a self-
magnetic  field  (due  to  the  induced  current  alone)  which  tries  to  keep  things  from 
changing.  What  is  the  direction  of  the  self-magnetic  field  due  to  your  induced  current 
inside the circuit loop, into the page or out of the page?    Is it in a direction so as to keep 
the flux through the loop from changing? 

Question  6:     What  is  the  magnitude  of  the  current  flowing  in  the  circuit  at  the  time 
shown (use  I  = | ε | / R )?

Question 8:       Assume  that  the  loop has  reached  "terminal velocity"--that  is,  that  it  is no 
longer  accelerating.  What  is  the  magnitude  of  that  terminal  velocity  in  terms  of  given 
quantities? 

Question  9:    What  is  the  general  equation  that  states  that  at  terminal  velocity,  the  rate 
at  which  gravity  is  doing  work  on  the  loop  is  equal  to  the  rate  at  which  energy  is  being 
dissipated  in  the  loop  through  Joule  heating  (the  rate  at  which  a  force  does  work  is 
G G 
⋅F V  )? 

Question 10:  Show that your general equation from Question 9 is in fact true in this case 
by  inserting  into  that  general  equation  your  current  in  Question  7  and  your  terminal 
velocity in Question 8.
