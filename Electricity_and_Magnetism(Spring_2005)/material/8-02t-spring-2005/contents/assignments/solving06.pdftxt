Example 1 :  Magnetic Field of a Cylindrical Shell 

We now apply this strategy to the following problem.   Consider the cylindrical conductor 
with a hollow center and copper walls of thickness b – a as shown .  The radii of the inner 
and  outer  walls  are  a  and  b  respectively,  and  the  current  i  is  uniformly  spread  over  the 
cross section of the copper (shaded region).  We want to calculate the magnetic field in the 
region a < r < b.

Question  1  (write  your  answer 
on  the  tear-sheet  at  the  end!!!): 
What  is  the  magnitude  of  the 
current  per  unit  area  J  in  the 
region  a  <  r  <  b?  Remember we 
are  assuming  that  the  current  I  in 
amps  is uniformly  spread over  the 
area a < r < b, and also remember 
that current density J  is defined as 
the current per unit area.   

Problem Solving Strategy Step 
(1) Draw Amperian Loop: 

Here we take a loop that is a circle of radius r with a < r < b (see figure). 

Problem Solving Strategy Step (2) Current enclosed by Amperian Loop: 

The next step is to calculate the current enclosed by this imaginary Amperian loop.  Hint: 
the  current  enclosed  is  that  part  of  the  area  of  the  imaginary  loop  in  which  the  current 
density J is  non-zero, times the current density J.

Law.  The  figure shows a slab of current with current density  J = J zˆ , where dimensions 
of  J  are  amps  per  square meter.    The  slab  of  current  is  infinite  in  the  x  and  z  directions,
