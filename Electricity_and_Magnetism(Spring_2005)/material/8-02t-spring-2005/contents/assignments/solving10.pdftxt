Problem Solving 10: Double-Slit Interference 

OBJECTIVES 
 
1.  To introduce the concept of interference. 
 
2.  To  find  the  conditions  for  constructive  and  destructive  interferences  in  a  double-slit 
interference experiment.  

 
3.  To compute the intensity of the interference pattern.

Introduction 
 
When  ordinary  light  is  emitted  from  two  different  sources  and  passes  through  two  narrow  slits, 
the  plane  waves  do  not  maintain  a  constant  phase  relation  and  the  light  shows  no  interference 
pattern  in  the  region  beyond  the  openings.  In  order  for  an  interference  pattern  to  develop,  the 
incoming light must satisfy two conditions: 
 

•  The  light  sources  must  be  coherent.  This  means  that  the  plane  waves  from  the  sources 
must maintain a constant phase relation. 

 

•  The light must be monochromatic. This means that the light has just one wavelength.

When  a  coherent  monochromatic  laser  light  falls  on  two  slits  separated  by  a  distance 
,  the 
 away  from 
emerging  light will produce an  interference pattern on a viewing  screen a distance
