Problem Solving 2: Calculating the Electric Field of Continuous Charge 
Distributions 

 
OBJECTIVES  
 
1.  To  look  at  the  meaning  of  linear  charge  density,  area  charge  density,  and  volume  charge 
density.   

 
2.  To calculate the electric field from a line of charge along two different directions. 
 
3.  To  examine  the  limiting  behavior  of  the  two  expressions when  the  length  of  the  line  goes  to 
zero, to make sure we recover the results we expect.

PROBLEM SOLVING STRATEGIES 
 
In Section 2.12 of  the Course Notes, we discussed  how  the  electric  field  at  an  observation  point 
P  is calculated for continuous charge distributions, and we repeat that discussion here.   We must 
evaluate the vector integral

ˆr
where   r is  the  distance  from  
dq
 to     and 
 is  the  corresponding  unit  vector.  To  complete  the 
P
integration, we follow the procedures outlined in your Course Notes and below: 
 
(1)  Start with

depending on whether the charge is distributed over a length, an area, or a volume.

(3) Substitute dq into the expression for dE

(4) Specify an appropriate coordinate system (Cartesian, cylindrical or spherical) and express the 
differential element ( dl, dA or dV ) and r  in terms of the coordinates (see  Table 2.1 below for a 
summary.).    If  you  need  a  review  of  the  various  coordinate  systems,  see  Review  Module  on

PROBLEM 1: Continuous Charge Densities 
 
Question  1  (Answer  on  the  tear-sheet  at  the  end!):  A  cylindrical  shell  of  length  L  and  radius 
R , with L >> R,  is uniformly charged with  total charge 
.     We only place charge on  the  sides 
 Q
of the cylinder.  The end caps of the cylinder have no charge.   
 

. 

a.  What  is  the  surface  charge  density σ on  the  cylinder  in  terms  of  the  variables  given?  
Check units! 

 
b.  Suppose you go very  far away  from  the cylinder  to  a distance much greater  than R.   The 
cylinder  now  looks  like  a  line  of  charge.    What  is  the  linear  charge  density λof  that 
apparent line of charge?  Check units! 

 
c.  What is relationship between your σ from (a) and your λ from (b)?  Check units!

b.  Suppose you go very  far away  from  the cylinder  to  a distance much greater  than R.   The 
cylinder  now  looks  like  a  line  of  charge.    What  is  the  linear  charge  density λof  that 
apparent line of charge?  Check units!

The next two problems both deal with the electric field of a line of charge.  We can only 
calculate that field analytically along two lines in space, both of which we do here.  At other 
points we must do a numerical calculation.  To see a global representation of what that electric 
field looks like everywhere, go to the ShockWave Visualization 
(http://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/8/8.02T/f04/visualizations/electrostatics/08-LineField/08-
LineField320.html) The figure 
below is the grass seeds map from that simulation, and shows the global structure of the electric 
field.

.  Calculate  the  electric  field  at  a  point  P located  along  the  axis  of  the  wire  and  a
