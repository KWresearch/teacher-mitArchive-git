Problem Solving 8: Driven LRC Circuits 

OBJECTIVES 

1.	 To  explore  the  relationship  between  driven  current  and  driving  emf  in  three  simple 
circuits  that  contain:  (1)  only  resistance;  (2)  only  inductance;  and  (3)  only 
capacitance. 

2.	 To  examine  these  same  relationships  in  the  general  case  where  R,  L,  and  C  are  all 
present, and to do two sample problems on the LRC circuits. 

REFERENCE:  Sections 12.1 – 12.4, 8.02 Course Notes. 

General Properties of Driven LRC Circuits 

We  have  previously  considered  the  “free”  oscillations  of  an  LRC  circuit.  These  are  the 
oscillations we  see  if we  just  “kick”  the  circuit  and  stand  back  and watch  it  oscillate.    If 
we do this we will see a natural frequency of oscillation that decays in a finite time.  Here 
we  consider  a  very  different  problem.   We  now  “drive”  the LRC  circuit with  a  source  of 
emf  with  some  (arbitrary)  amplitude  and  frequency.  If  we  drive  the  circuit  with  an 
emf V t  
( )  = V  sin  ωt , where ω  is any frequency we desire (we get to pick this) and  V0   is 
0
any  amplitude  we  desire,  then  the  “driven”  response  of  the  system,  as  opposed  to  its 
natural “free” oscillations (which we assume have exponentially decayed to zero) is given 
by 

where 

(I t ) = I  sin( ωt −φ)

Note  the  “driven”  response  is  at  the  (arbitrary)  frequency  of  the  driver,  and  not  at  any 
natural  frequency  of  the  system.  However  the  system will  show maximum  response  to 
the  driving  emf  when  the  driving  frequency  is  at  the  natural  frequency  of  oscillation  of 
the system, i.e. when ω= 1 /   LC  .  We can compute the average power consumed by the 
circuit by calculating the time average of I(t)V(t) (see Section 12.4, 8.02 Course Notes):

Sample  Problem 1 

The  circuit  shown  below  contains  an  AC  generator  which  provides  a  source  of 
sinusoidally  varying  emf ε(t)  = ε  sinωt,  a  resistor with  resistance  R,  and  a  "black  box", 
0
which  contains  either  an  inductor  or  a  capacitor,  but  not  both.  The  amplitude  of  the 
driving  emf,  ε0,    is  100  Volts/meter,  and  the  angular  frequency ω  is  10  rad/sec.  We 
measure  the  current  in  the  circuit  and  find  that  it  is  given  as  a  function  of  time  by  the 
expression:  I(t) = (10 Amps) sin(ωt  − π/4)

The  circuit  shown  below  contains  an  AC  generator  which  provides  a  source  of 
sinusoidally  varying  emf ε(t)  = ε  sin(ωt),  a  resistor  with  resistance  R  =  1  ohm,  and  a 
0
"black box", which contains either an  inductor or a capacitor, or both.  The amplitude of 
the  driving  emf,  ε0, 
is  1  Volt.  We  measure  the  current  in  the  circuit  at  an  angular 
frequency ω   =1 radians/sec and find  that  it  is exactly  in phase with  the driving emf.   We 
measure  the current  in  the circuit at an angular  frequency ω =2  radians/sec and  find  that 
it lags the driving emf by exactly π/4 radians.  [Note:  π/4 radians = 45 ° , tan (π/4) = +1].

will need to know that the time-average of  sin 2 ωt  is ½.
