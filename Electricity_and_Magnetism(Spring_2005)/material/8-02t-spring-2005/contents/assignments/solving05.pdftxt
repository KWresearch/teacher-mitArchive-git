Magnetic Force on a Straight Wire in an External Magnetic Field 

Consider  a  straight  wire  of  length  L   and  cross  sectional  area  A   which  carries  a 
current I  .  The  current  consists  of  moving  positive  charge.   
The  wire  is  placed  in  a 
G 
B 
constant  external magnetic  field 
. We  want  to  calculate  the  force  on  this  wire  due  to

In Figure 1,  the charge carriers are assumed  to be positive  for simplicity and move  to  the 
G
right  with  a  drift  velocity  v d  .  Suppose  the  density  of  positive  charge  carriers  is  ρ 
coulombs/cubic meter.   

Question  1  (Write  your  answer  on  the  tear-sheet  at  the  end!):   What  is  the  amount  of 
charge dq in our line segment in terms of ρ, A, and dx? 

Question  2  (Write  your  answer  on  the  tear-sheet  at  the  end!):    In  a  time  dt ,  all  the 
charge in the element of length  dx = vd  dt  will cross the area  A  at the end of the element. 
Find an expression for the total charge  dq  that crosses the area A in this time dt. 

Question  3  (Write  your  answer  on  the  tear-sheet  at  the  end!):   Find  an  expression  for 
the current  in  the wire  in  terms of ρ, A,  and  vd.   Remember,  the current  in  the wire  is  the 
amount  of  charge  that  flows  pass  a  fixed  point  divided  by  the  time  it  takes  for  that 
amount of charge to flow past that point.

Force on a Rectangular Current Loop in a Uniform Magnetic Field 

Given our  result above, we now want  to calculate  the  force on a  loop of current-carrying 
wire  sitting  in  a  constant  external magnetic  field.    Take  a  small  rectangular  square  loop, 
with sides  a  and  b , carrying a current  I . The loop is placed in a uniform magnetic field, 
G
B ext   which is in the plane of the loop and points to the right (Figure 2). Let  nˆ  be the unit 
normal  to  the  plane  of  the  loop.  We  define  the  direction  of  nˆ   to  be  pointing  in  a 
direction defined by your right  thumb when you curl  the fingers of your right hand in the 
direction of the current in the loop

Torque on a Rectangular Current Loop in a Uniform Magnetic Field: 

In Figure 3a  (next  page) we  repeat Figure 2,  and  in Figure 3b, we  show  the  loop  as  seen 
looking up  the  kˆ   axis   (the   kˆ  vector  is  into  the page  in Figure 3b).  In order  to  calculate 
the  torque  on  side  4  about  the  center  of  the  loop,  it  is  sufficient  to  consider  the  entire 
force on side 4 as acting at the midpoint of the side.  The torque on side 4 is given by

Magnetic Dipole Moment 
The magnetic dipole moment vector  µ G  of a planar current loop is defined as follows. For
G
a planar loop,  µ  is defined in terms of the current  I  , the area  A  of the loop, and the unit 
normal  nˆ  to the plane of the loop, 

G
G µ ≡ IA = IAnˆ 

The normal  nˆ  points in a direction defined by your right thumb when you curl the fingers 
of your right hand in the direction of the current in the loop.  

The  torque  on  a  planar  current  loop  or  any magnetic  dipole  in  a  uniform  magnetic  field
