INTRODUCTION 

When  a  positively  charged  object  such  as  a  glass  rod  is placed near  a  conductor,  electric 
fields  inside  the  conductor  exert  forces  on  the  free  charge  carriers  in  the  conductor 
(electrons  in  metallic  conductors),  which  cause  them  to  move.  Some  of  those  negative 
charges  redistribute  themselves  near  the  glass  rod  leaving  the  parts  of  the  conductor 
furthest  from  the  glass  rod  positively  charged.  This  process  occurs  rapidly,  and  ends 
when  there  is  no  longer  any  electric  field  inside  the  conductor.  The  surface  of  the 
conductor  ends  up  with  regions  where  there  is  an  excess  of  one  type  of  charge  over  the 
other.  This  charge  distribution  is  called  an  induced  charge  distribution.  The  process  of 
separating  positive  from  negative  charges  on  a  conductor  by  the  presence  of  a  charged 
object is called electrostatic induction. 

Michael  Faraday  used  a  metal  ice  pail  as  a  conducting  object  to  study  how  charges 
distributed themselves when a charged object was brought inside the pail. Suppose the ice 
pail  has  a  lid  with  a  small  opening  through  which  we  lower  a  positively  charged  metal 
ball  into  the  pail  without  touching  it  to  the  pail.  When  we  do  this,  negative  charges  in 
the  pail  move  to  the  inner  surface  of  the  pail,  because  they  are  attracted  to  the  positive 
charge on  the metal ball,  leaving positive charges on  the outside of  the pail.   If we at  this 
point touch our hand to the outside of the pail, those positive charges on the outside of the 
pail  will  run  off  to  infinity  through  our  hand.    If  we  then  remove  our  hand  from  the 
outside  of  the  pail,  and  then  remove  the  positively  charged metal  ball  from  the  inside  of 
the  pail,  the  outside  of  the  pail  will  be  left  with  a  net  negative  charge.    This  is  called 
charging by induction. 

In  contrast,  if we  put  the  positively  charged  ball  inside  the  uncharged  pail  and  touch  the 
inside of  the  ice pail, electrons flow  into  the ball, exactly neutralizing  the positive charge 
on the ball. This leaves the pail with a net positive charge residing on the outer surface of 
the pail. This is called charging by contact.

Finally,  when  a  positively  charged  ball  approaches  the  ice  pail  from  outside  of  the  pail, 
charges  will  redistribute  themselves  on  the  outside  surface  of  the  pail  and  will  exactly 
cancel the electric field inside the pail.  This is called electrostatic shielding. 

You will demonstrate  all  three of  these phenomena—charging by  induction,  charging by 
contact, and electrostatic shielding—in this experiment.   

We  explain  these  phenomena  in  more  detail  in  what  follows.    The  fact  that  the  excess 
charge  on  the  ice  pail  resides  entirely  on  the  surface may  be  explained  by Gauss’s  Law. 
Gauss’s Law states  that  the electric flux  through any closed surface  is proportional  to  the 
charge enclosed inside that surface,

The above relation describing Gauss’s Law  is Equation 4.2.5 of  the 8.02 Course Notes; a 
more  extensive  explanation  of  the  relation  between  Gauss’s  Law  and  Coulomb’s  Law 
may be found in Chapter 4 of the Course Notes. 

Consider a mathematical, closed Gaussian surface that is inside the surface of the ice pail 
( Figure 1 ; think of this as a view of a thick-walled cylinder from above).  

Figure 1 Gaussian surface for the Faraday Ice Pail. 

Once  static  equilibrium  has  been  reached,  the  electric  field  inside  the metal  walls  of  the 
ice  pail  is  zero. Note  that  the  electric  field  in  the  hollow  region  inside  the  ice  pail  is  not 
zero due to the presence of the charged ball. Since the Gaussian surface is in a conducting 
region where  there  is  zero  electric  field,  the  electric  flux  through  the Gaussian  surface  is 
also zero. Therefore, by Gauss’s Law, the net charge inside the Gaussian surface must be 
zero.  For  the  Faraday  ice  pail,  the  positively  charged  ball  is  inside  the Gaussian  surface. 
Therefore, there must be an additional induced negative charge on the inner surface of the 
ice  pail  that  exactly  cancels  the  positive  charge  on  the  ball.  Since  the  pail  is  uncharged, 

E03-2


by charge conservation, there must be a positive induced charge on the pail which has the 
same magnitude as  the negative  induced charge. This positive charge must reside outside 
the Gaussian surface, hence on the outer surface of the ice pail. 

A  further  explanation  of  the  nature  of  electric  fields  in  and  near  a  conductor  may  be 
found in Section 4.3 of the 8.02 Course Notes. 

Now  suppose  the  ice  pail  is  connected  to  a  large  conducting  object  (“ground”)  as  in 
Figure 2: 

Figure 2 Charge distribution on the Gaussian surface. 

When  a  positively  charged  object  is  inserted  into  the  pail,  negative  charge  carriers  will 
flow  from  the  ground  onto  the  outer  surface  of  the  pail.  If  the  wire  to  ground  is  then 
disconnected,  the  pail  will  have  an  overall  negative  charge.  Once  the  positively  charged 
ball  is  removed,  this  negative  charge will  redistribute  itself  over  the  surfaces  of  the  pail; 
i.e., the pail is charged negatively. 

When  a  positively  charged  ball  approaches  the  ice  pail  from  outside  of  the  pail,  charges 
will  redistribute  themselves on  the outside  surface of  the pail  and will  exactly  cancel  the 
electric  field  inside  the  pail.  This  effect  is  called  shielding  or  “screening”  and  explains 
popular  science  demonstrations  in  which  a  person  sits  safely  inside  a  cage  while  an 
enormous  voltage  is  applied  to  the  cage.  This  same  effect  explains why metal  boxes  are 
used to screen out undesirable electric fields from sensitive equipment. 

APPARATUS 

1. Ice Pail 

Our  primary  apparatus  consists  of  two wire-mesh  cylinders. The  inner  cylinder  (the  “Ice 
Pail”)  has  a  diameter  of  10 cm  and  is  15 cm  deep.  Three  insulating  rods  support  the 
bottom  of  the  inner  wire  cylinder  above  a  plastic  support  stand.  The  outer  wire  mesh 
cylinder is also mounted on the support and acts as a screen to eliminate the effect of any 

E03-3


external charges and other external fields. The outer cylinder has no bottom wire mesh. It 
will be connected  to a common ground;  this means  that electrons can flow  to or from  the 
shield as necessary. 

We  are  making  two  approximations  in  this  experiment.  The  wire  mesh  has  many 
openings, so the actual induced charge distributions are quite complicated. Also, our “Ice 
Pail”  does  not  have  a  lid,  so  technically  there  is  no  “inner”  and  “outer”  surface  on  the 
inner  wire  mesh  cylinder.  Assume  that  the  effects  of  these  two  complications  are  small 
and proceed as if our ice pail surface were solid and covered.  

2. Charge Producer 

In experiments using the Faraday “Ice Pail,” a charge producer (Figure 3) will be inserted 
inside  the  inner  wire  mesh  cylinder.  This  will  cause  the  inner  wire  mesh  cylinder  to 
develop an inner charge distribution and an outer charge distribution.  

If  the  outer  mesh  is  connected  to  ground,  then  the  sign  of  the  voltage  on  the  inner  wire 
mesh will  have  the  same  sign  as  the  sign  of  the  charge  on  the  outer  surface  of  the  inner 
wire mesh. We will measure this outer charge distribution using a Charge Sensor.

3. Charge Sensor

The  Charge  Sensor  is  a  device  that  can  detect  charges  on  objects  by  measuring  the 
voltage  between  them,  as  described  below.  The  Charge  Sensor  has  a  very  high  input 
resistance,  which  means  that  it  does  not  draw  off  significant  amounts  of  charge.  The 
Charge  Sensor  has  two  leads  (Figure  4). The  negative  (black)  lead  of  the Charge  Sensor 
is connected  to  the outer wire  shield, which acts as ground. The positive  lead  (red on  the 
clip lead) is connected to the inner wire mesh cylinder.  

E03-4


Figure 4 Charge Sensor. 

Your  measurements  will  be  primarily  qualitative,  so  the  following  details  about  the 
Charge  Sensor  are  mentioned  only  for  general  interest.  The  Charge  Sensor  actually 
measures the voltage difference between the inner wire mesh and the shield. This voltage 
arises  from  the  charges  on  the  outer  surface  of  the  inner  wire  mesh;  positive  voltage 
measurements  correspond  to  positive  charge  on  that  surface.  The  voltage  measurements 
can  be  converted  into  charge  measurements  by  a  calibration.  The  Charge  Sensor  is 
designed to minimally affect the actual charges on the inner wire mesh.  

The Charge Sensor has a built-in amplifier with a gain G, which multiplies  the measured 
voltage difference by a factor G to give an output voltage 

Vout  = G V
in 

 

(3.2) 

There  are  three  gain  settings:  1,  5  and  20  (Figure  5.)  The  amplifier  can  only  read  a 
maximum  voltage  input  of  ±10 V  on  the  1x  setting,  ±2 V  on  the  5x  setting  and 
. 
±0 5  V  on  the  20x  setting.  The  ZERO  switch  on  the  Charge  Sensor  brings  the  input 
voltage to ground. 

                Your amplifier should be set on the 1x setting.

Figure 5 Gain and Zero Settings for Charge Sensor. 

When the Charge Sensor is used on the most sensitive range (20x), it may display a small 
“offset”  voltage.  That  is,  pressing  the  ZERO  switch  may  not  cause  the  voltage  to  go 
exactly to zero. Although this residual voltage is typically quite small (less than 0.1 volt ), 
it  will  be  constant  for  any  particular  gain  setting  and  can  be  subtracted  from  the  final 
measurement to give a more accurate reading.

A. Charge Sensor and Calibration

1.	 Using the cable provided, connect the Charge Sensor to the Analog Channel A on 
the  750  Interface.    The  cable  runs  from  the  right  end  of  the  sensor  as  shown  in 
Figure 5 to Channel A. 
2.	 Connect  the  cable  assembly  on  the  BNC  port  on  the  Charge  Sensor  (see  left  end 
of  the sensor  in Figure 5).  Line up  the connector on  the end of  the cable with  the 
pin  on  the  BNC  port.  Push  the  connector  onto  the  port  and  then  twist  the 
connector clockwise about one-quarter turn until it clicks into place.

3.	 Download the file  The Charge Sensor  exp03.ds from the web and save the file to 
your desktop  (right click on  the  link and choose “Save Target As”  to  the desktop. 
Overwrite  any  file  by  this  name  that  is  already  there).    To  start Data  Studio with 
this  file,  either  double  click  on  this  file  or  drag  the  icon  for  exp03.ds  onto  the 
Data  Studio  Icon  on  the  desktop  of  the  computer.    Connect  the  Charge  Sensor 
input  lead  (red alligator clip)  to  the  inner wire mesh  cylinder. The Charge Sensor 
ground  lead  (black  alligator  clip)  attaches  to  the  shield  (the  outer  wire  mesh 
cylinder). Set the Charge Sensor gain to 1x. 

B. Data Studio File 
The  instructions  presented  here  are  quite  basic;  Data  Studio  is  capable  of  doing  much 
more,  as  we  will  see  during  the  term.    You  are  welcome  to  explore  the  possibilities  as 
long as you complete  this experiment.   For  instance, you might want  to  try  to change  the 
time duration of data recording to some other interval that suits you, or the ranges of your 
graphs  or  meters.    The  following  instructions  are  for  Data  Studio  as  prepared  in 
exp03.ds.  For  more  information  on  how  to  use  Data  Studio  for  8.02T,  see  the  “Help” 
menu on the Data Studio toolbar. 
1.	 The Data Studio file has a Voltage Graph  and a  Charge Graph. 
2.	 The  data  recording  is  set  at  10  samples  per  second  (10 Hz ),  for  a  duration  of 
20 seconds . 

MEASUREMENTS 

Before  starting  any  experiment  using  the Faraday  Ice Pail,  the  pail must  be momentarily 
grounded.  To  ground  the  pail,  touch  both  the  inner  wire  mesh  and  the  outer  wire 
shield  at  the  same  time  with  a  conductor  such  as  the  finger  of  one  hand.    You  also 
will  always  want  to  always  press  the  “ZERO”  button  on  the  Charge  Sensor  to 
discharge the sensor before starting. 
Each part of  this experiment will  require a bit of dexterity, and you might not get  it  right 
the  first  time  or  two.    If  so,  this  is  of  no  consequence.    Just  try  again  as  needed.   For 
instance, if you accidentally touch the inside of the pail when you don’t want to, you will 
need to try again. 
Moving  the  Charge  Producer  carefully  while  watching  two  graphs  is  beyond  the 
capabilities of most students.  The data will be recorded on the graphs.  One possibility is 
to have the members of a group rotate tasks. 
Remember,  the duration of data  recording  is  set at 20  seconds,  so you’ll have  to do what 
needs  to be done  in  that  time  (or  figure out how  to  change  the  recording duration, which 

E03-7


is  not  too  hard).    You  might  consider  reversing  the  first  two  steps  in  each  part  (but  be
