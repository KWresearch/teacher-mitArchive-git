OBJECTIVES 

1.  To investigate the magnetic force between two current carrying wires. 
2.  To measure the permeability constant µ0 . 

INTRODUCTION 

The magnetic  force on a current-carrying conductor underpins every electric motor  -  turning  the 
hands  of  electric  watches  and  clocks,  transporting  tape  in  Walkmans,  starting  cars,  operating 
refrigerator compressors, etc. In this experiment, you will investigate the magnetic force between 
two current carrying wires.  One wire will be a coil of 10  turns and  the other will be a coil of 38 
turns.  The 10-turn coil will be taped to one end of a pivoted balance beam.   The beam pivots on 
two pins.  It also makes electrical contact through the two pins, allowing current to flow onto the 
beam  and  through  the  10-turn  coil.    The  38-turn  coil  will  be  positioned  on  the  table  directly 
below  the  10-turn  coil.  A  current  traveling  through  both  coils  will  produce  a  magnetic  force 
between  the  coils,  either  attraction  or  repulsion,  depending  on  the  relative  direction  of  the 
currents.  You  will  measure  the  magnitude  of  this  force  by  noting  when  the  magnetic  torque 
produced by  this  force between  the coils  is balanced by  the  torque due  to  the  force of gravity on 
known weights. 

In  this  experiment we will determine  a value  for  the  constant µ0  .  To do  this we will depend on 
the  multimeter  calibration  of  the  amount  of  current  flowing  through  the  coils  in  amperes. 
Usually we  define  the  ampere  so  that  the  constant µ = 4π×10

between  current-carrying  wires.  Here  we  will  do  the  inverse—we  assume  our  multimeter  gives 
an  accurate  value  for  the  current,  and  we  measure  forces  to  determine  the  constant µ0  .  This 
requires a calculation of the force expected between two current-carrying coils. 

THEORY 

Consider  a  system  of  two  coils  having  currents  flowing  in  opposite  directions,  as  shown  in 
G 
Figure  1. What  is  the  force  between  the  coils?  Is  it  attractive  or  repulsive?    In  the  figure,  B 2  is 
the magnetic field at coil #2 produced by the current in coil #1.

In  our  experimental  setup,  the  two  coils  are  separated  by  a  distance  d  which  is  much  smaller 
than  r ,  the  radius  of  either  coil    (for  purposes  of  clarity,  the  figure  is  not  to  scale).    As  a  first 
approximation, we  can  treat  the  two  coils  as  if  they  were  parallel  wires  separated  by  a  distance 
(cid:71)
1B
d . In this limit we neglect the contribution to the magnetic field, 
, from parts of the lower coil 
that  are  not  directly  below  the  small  current  element  in  the  upper  coil.    This  will  over-estimate 
the  force  somewhat  (can  you  see  qualitatively  why?)  but  the  error  is  not  more  than  about  10% 
with your arrangement. 
 
The  expression  for  the  magnitude  of  the  force  per  unit  length  between  two  infinite  wires  (an 
approximation  to  very  long  wires  or,  in  our  case,  the  coils  separated  by  a  distance  small 
compared to the common coil radius) is derived in the 8.02 Course Notes, Section 9.2;

By Newton’s  third  law,  the  total force on coil #1  is equal  in direction and opposite  in magnitude 
of the force on coil #2. 
 
The  magnetic  force  is  balanced  by  aluminum  foil  weights  that  are  placed  at  an  equal  distance 
from  the  pivot  as  the  center  of  the  upper  coil.  If  the  weights  are  all  the  same  –

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Figure 5 Spacing between the 10-turn and 38-turn coils 

The  coil  end  of  the  beam  is  much  heavier  than  the  other  end.    The  beam  is  approximately 
balanced  by  taping  one  penny,  appropriately  located,  on  the  light  end.  Balancing  the  beam  will 
determine  the  distance  d  between  the  coils  used  in  Equations  (8.1)  -  (8.8)  above.  In  the 
experiment,  when  a  current  runs  through  the  coils  the  beam  will  return  to  this  equilibrium 
position when the weight of the aluminum foil squares is just equal to the magnetic force.  

EXPERIMENT 

Depending  upon  the  winding  direction  of  the  coils,  the  current  through  them  will  generate 
magnetic  forces  such  that  the  coils  will  either  attract  or  repel  each  other,  depending  on  the 
relative  direction  of  the  currents.  The  current  direction  is  reversed  with  the  switch  shown  in 
Figure  7  (but  not  in  the  circuit  diagram,  Figure  6).    For  this  experiment,  it  is  not  practical  to 
measure  the  current  directly.  Instead,  a  voltmeter  is  put  in  parallel  with  known  resistance; 
from Ohm’s Law,  the current  in  the circuit, and hence  in  the coils, will be proportional  to  the 
measured voltage. 

Start  by  downloading  the Excel  spreadsheet  exp08.xls  and  saving  to  your  desktop. Measure  the 
following quantities; record your values both in the Excel spreadsheet and on the tear-off sheet at 
the end of these instructions. 

1.  The diameter  D of the upper 10-turn coil. 

2.  The  average  distance  d  between  the  centers  of  the  coil  for  the  balanced  beam  with  no 
current  flowing  in  the  coil  or  foil  on  the  beam;  this  will  serve  as  your  reference  point  for 
equilibrium when  current  flows  and  foil  is  on  the  beam.   When  balanced,  the  coils  should 
be  as  close  to  parallel  as  you  can  get  them  to  be.    If  necessary,  you  may  have  to  place  a 
small  piece  of  foil  on  the  beam  (but  if  you  do  this,  that  piece  of  foil must  remain  in  place 
throughout the experiment. 
In making this measurement, you will likely find that the balance is rather delicate, and that 
even a small amount of jostling will disturb the equilibrium.  You might even find that you 
have  to  hold  your  breath while waiting  for  the  balance  to  reach  equilibrium.    It  is  this  sort 
of delicacy that allows measurements of small effects. 

3.  The  length  	L of  the  #16  resistance  wire  (a  stiff  shiny  alloy  800  wire  about  1.3  mm  in 
diameter  with  a  resistance  of  1.02  Ω/m).    For  purposes  of  clarity,  this  wire  is  shown  as

being curved  in Figure 6, while  in reality  the wire  is almost straight, as shown  in Figure 7. 
The resistance of this wire is

⎟ L . 
cm ⎠ 

The voltmeter probe leads are connected across this wire.  When current flows in the circuit, you 
will  calculate  the  current  flowing  through  the  circuit  by  measuring  the  voltage  across  the  #16 
resistance  wire  using  the  250mV  setting  of  the  multimeter.  The  current  in  the  circuit  is  then 
calculated using Ohm’s Law, 

I  =

Turn  on  the  LVPS;  the  lamp will  tell  you  if  current  is  flowing.  Adjust  the  output  of  the  LVPS; 
for  this  experiment  the multimeter will  read  between  20 mV  and  100 mV  on  the  50µΑ(250mV) 
scale.  The  idea  is  to  balance  the  magnetic  force  with  the  weights  of  known  masses  of  foil. 
Several arrangements of the experiment’s parameters are possible.  The current through the coils 
can  be  set  to  attract  or  to  repel,  the  current  can  be  raised  or  lowered,  and  the  weights  can  exert 
their  force  at  either  end  of  the  beam.    (The  weights  could  be  placed  at  other  places  on  the 
balance, but this experiment does not use this option.)  Think through how these setups vary and 
what might be the advantages of one over the other. 

Having  the  coils  close  together  is  a  good  idea;  the  magnetic  force,  whether  attracting  or 
repelling,  is  strongest  in  that  position.  Also  the  coil  spacing  is  easier  to  measure,  and  more 
reproducible,  under  those  conditions.  But  should  the  coils  be  wired  to  repel  or  attract?    Both 
ways work.  But  the  ‘repulsion’ choice  is preferable because once  the coils start  to separate  the 
repulsive  forces  are  reduced  in  two  ways  simultaneously:  by  the  reduced  current  and  by  the 
separation  of  the  coils.  As  the  current  is  reduced  the  coils  approach  each  other,  resulting  in  a 
greater repulsive force, and the beam damps down to the equilibrium position.

4.	 Set the coils to repel by setting the switch to the appropriate position. 

5.	 Start  with  three  2 cm ×  1 cm  rectangles  of  #7  aluminum  foil.  Carefully  cut  out  three 
weights of this size using the template provided with the foil. 

6.	 Center  the  three  pieces  of  foil  on  the  line  directly  above  the  10-turn  coil  on  the  balance. 
(You  are  actually  balancing  torques!)  Using  the  tweezers will  help  to  avoid  jostling  the 
balance. 

7.	 Turn the current up high, in order for the magnetic repulsion to overcome the weight.  

8.	 Bring  the  current  down  slowly  and  as  smoothly  as  you  can.    Find  the  current  where  the 
magnetic  repulsion  and  weight  balance.    Use  your  ruler  to  confirm  that  the  distance 
between the coils when balanced is your standard equilibrium distance  d . 
This part of the data collection can be tricky and frustrating, and requires patience as well 
as fairly good eyesight.  As when you first determined the equilibrium separation  d , you 
might even have to hold your breath while waiting for the balance to reach equilibrium. 

Record the measured voltage both in the table provided with these instructions and in the 
spreadsheet. 

9.	 Make several measurements of  the current at which  the balance  is  in equilibrium with all 
three weights.  Between measurements, turn the current up higher or down lower, or even 
turn  the current off.  Then, remove one weight at a  time and again measure  the current at 
which  the  balance  is  in  equilibrium.    Repeat  the  measurements  to  make  sure  they  are 
consistent and tabulate the data, number of weights as a function of current.
