Experiment 5: Magnetic Fields of a Bar Magnet and of the Earth 

OBJECTIVES 

1.	 To examine  the magnetic  field associated with a bar magnet and construct  the 
magnetic field lines. 
2.	 To  measure  the  magnitude  and  approximate  orientation  of  the  Earth’s 
magnetic field in classroom. 

INTRODUCTION 

In  these  exercises,  you  will  study  the  magnetic  field  of  bar  magnets  and  the  earth.  You 
will draw  field  lines and analyze  their meaning.    You will measure  the Earth’s magnetic 
field in classroom. 

PROCEDURE 

Part 1:  Constructing Magnetic Field Lines of a Bar Magnet 

Tape  a  piece  of  brown  paper  (provided)  onto  your  table.  Stay  far  away  from  any  iron 
objects.  Place  a  bar  magnet  about  3  inches  from  the  far  side  of  the  paper,  as  shown  in 
Figure 1. Trace the outline of the magnet on the paper. 

7  3 inches, more or less 

Figure 1 Setup for constructing magnetic field lines of a bar magnet 

Determine  which  ends  of  your  magnet  are  north  or  south  magnetic  poles.  Take  one  of 
your  small  compasses.  The  arrow  on  the  compass  is  magnetic  and  will  experience  a 
torque  so  that  the  North  pole  of  the  compass  will  point  in  the  direction  of  the  Earth’s 
magnetic  field  if no other magnetic  fields  are present. As depicted  in Figure 2,  the North 
pole  of  the  compass  points  towards  the  South  magnetic  pole  of  the  Earth  which  is  very 
close to the Earth’s geographic North Pole.

compass heading. 

It  also means  that,  if  you  place  the  compass  near  the  bar magnet,  the North  pole  of  your 
compass will point toward the South pole of the bar magnet or away from the North pole 
when placed as shown in Figure 3. 

Figure 3 Direction of the compass when placed near a bar magnet 

Mark  the  North  and  South  magnetic  poles  of  your  magnet  on  the  paper. Make  sure  you 
stay away from any other magnets, electrical circuits or iron materials as you do this. 

WARNING:  Don’t  rely  on  the  painted  arrows  on  the  pointers  in  the  compass  to  tell 
which  pole  is  North  and  which  is  South;  they  don’t  all  use  the  same  convention.   Make 
sure the pointers can rotate freely. 

A.  Construct  Field  Line  #1:    Place  a  compass  near  one  end  of  the magnet.   Make  two 
dots on the paper, one at the end of the compass needle next to the magnet and the second 
at  the  other  end  of  the  compass  needle.    Now  move  the  compass  so  that  the  end  of  the 
needle that was next to the magnet is directly over the second dot, and make a new dot at 
the  other  end  of  the  needle.    Continue  this  process  until  the  compass  comes  back  to  the 
magnet or leaves the edge of the paper.  Draw a line through the dots and indicate with an 
arrowhead  the direction  in which  the North end of  the needle pointed, as shown below  in 
Figure 4: 

Figure 4 Constructing magnetic field lines 

E05-2 

B.  Construct  Field  Line  #2:    Repeat  the  process  described  above,  but  this  time,  start 
with  the  compass  touching  the  magnet  approximately  1  cm  (1/2  inch)  in  from  the  same 
end of the magnet that you used above. 

C.  Construct Field Line # 3:  Repeat once more, but start about 4 cm (1.5 inches) from 
the same end. 

Question 1 (answer on your tear-sheet at the end): 
Mostly  your  field  lines  come  back  to  the  bar  magnet,  but  some  of  them  wander  off  and 
never  come  back  to  the  bar  magnet.    Which  part  of  your  bar  magnet  do  the  ones  that 
wander off never to return come from?  What’s going on? 

Part 2:  Constructing a Magnetic Field Diagram 

Using  a  clean  portion  of  the  paper  (or  turn  the  paper  over,  or  get  a  new  piece  of  paper), 
arrange  compasses  and  two  magnets  as  shown  in  Figure  5  below.    Allow  enough  room 
between  the magnet  poles  to  place  three  compasses  roughly  as  shown  below.   Please  do 
NOT  force a north pole  to  touch a north pole or a  south pole  to  touch a  south pole, as 
this will demagnetize the magnets. 

Figure 5 Two magnets with opposite poles facing each other. 

Sketch  the  compass  needles’  directions  in  the  diagram.  Based  on  these  compass 
directions, sketch in some field lines. 

Question 2 (answer on your tear-sheet at the end): 
Transfer  the  field  lines  you  have  drawn  on  the  brown  paper  to  the  figure  on  your  tear-
sheet at the end. 

Next  reverse  one  magnet  so  that  the  two  north  poles  are  facing  each  other,  as  shown  in 
Figure 6: 

E05-3


Figure 6 Two magnets with like poles facing each other. 

Again,  sketch  the  compass  needles’  directions  in  the  diagram.    Based  on  these  compass 
directions, sketch in some field lines. 

Question 3  (answer on the tear-sheet at the end): 
Transfer  the  field  lines  you  have  drawn  on  the  brown  paper  to  the  figure  on  your  tear-
sheet at the end.   Is there any place in this diagram where the magnitude of the magnetic 
field is equal to zero?  Where? 

Part 3:  Superposition of Vector Fields 

Place  two  bar magnets  on  the  paper  at  right  angles  to  one  another  as  illustrated  below  in 
Figure 7.  Let P be  the point  that  lies along  the centerlines of both magnets.   Arrange  the 
two  bar magnets  so  that  their  ends  are  equidistant  from P.  Trace  the  outlines  of  the  two 
magnets and label their poles.   

Figure 7 Two magnets at right angles to each other. 

Place  a  compass  at  point P.  Mark  the  needle  position with  two  dots,  and  draw  an  arrow 
indicating the needle’s direction.   

Now  remove  bar  magnet  1  and  indicate  the  compass  needle’s  direction  in  the  same 
manner  as  above.    Then  replace  bar  magnet  1  to  its  original  position  and  remove  bar 
magnet 2.  Again, indicate the compass needle’s direction by drawing an arrow.   Are bar 
magnet 1 and bar magnet 2 of equal strength? 

E05-4


Next  with  both  magnets  back  in  the  position  shown  above,  move  magnet  1  a  few 
centimeters to the right and describe the change in direction of the needle.  Move it a few 
more centimeters to the right, and again observe the result. 

Question 4 (answer on your tear-sheet at the end): 
Imagine  that  two  bar  magnets  are  placed  at  right  angles  to  one  another,  arranged  as 
shown in Figure 7. The magnets are equidistant from point P, the point that lies along the 
centerlines  of  both  magnets.  A  compass  is  placed  at  the  point  P.  In  what  direction  does 
the needle point?

Earth’s magnetic field at MIT. 

APPARATUS 

A.  Connecting the Magnetic Field Sensor to the 750 Interface 
To  connect  the magnetic  field  sensor  to  the  750  Interface,  take  the  cable  attached  to  the 
sensor  (shown  in  Figure  8  below)  and  plug  it  into ANALOG CHANNEL  A  on  the  front 
of the 750 Interface, as shown in Figure 9 below 

Figure 8 Top view of the magnetic field sensor, showing (from right to left) the RANGE 
SELECT  switch,  the  TARE  button,  and  the  RADIAL/AXIAL  switch,  which  is  set  to 
RADIAL.

 The DataStudio Software 

Download  the Data Studio  file exp05.ds  from  the web page  and  save  it on your desktop. 
Open  the  activity  by  double  clicking  on  the  icon  on  the  desktop. This Data Studio  file  is 
set  to  take  data  continuously  when  you  hit  START  until  you  hit  STOP  (the  START 
button  changes  to  STOP  once  you  start,  and  vice  versa).    You  will  be  measuring  one 
component  of  the magnetic  field  at  the  sensor  (see  description  below).   When  the  plot  if 
the data taken reaches the right end of the graph the oldest data will drop off the screen. 
You  will  probably  find  it  convenient  to  start  and  stop  often,  and  to  erase  previous  data 
runs if they get in the way.  To erase previous data runs, go to the Experiment menu item 
and select Delete ALL Data Runs.

C.
 Data Collection 
Look at the top of your magnetic field sensor, as shown  in Figure 8 above.   The software 
is assuming that you have set the gain on the magnetic field sensor to 10X; look at on the 
magnetic  field  sensor  and make  sure  the RANGE SELECT button  is  set on 10X.  Now 
hit the TARE button on the top of the sensor. This action zeroes the sensor at the value of 
the field it is reading when you hit TARE.  That is, your measurement of  the field  is not 
an absolute measurement, but a relative measurement (relative to the value of the field 
when you hit the TARE button). 
The  magnetic  field  sensor  can  measure  the  component  of  the  magnetic  field  in  two 
different directions: 
1.  along the axis of the probe (axial), 
2.  perpendicular to the axis of the probe (radial).   

You  choose  which  component  the  sensor  will  measure  by  using  the  switch  marked 
RADIAL/AXIAL on the top of the sensor (see Figure 8). 

If  you  choose  axial,  the  sensor  will  measure  the  component  of  the  magnetic  field  along 
the  axis  of  the  probe,  giving a  positive  value  when  the magnetic  field  is  pointing  into 
the white dot on the end of the probe.  

E05-6


If  you  choose  radial,  the  sensor  will  measure  the  component  of  the  magnetic  field 
perpendicular  to  the  axis  of  the  probe  at  the  white  dot  on  the  side  of  the  probe  giving  a 
positive value when the magnetic field is pointing into this white dot. 

MEASUREMENTS 

To get a sense of how the Magnetic Field Sensor operates, we’ll start by using the sensor 
to find components of the magnetic field of the bar magnet used in Parts 1-3. 

I:  The axial component of the bar magnetic field  
Use your magnetic  compass  to determine  the North  and South poles of your bar magnet. 
Put  the  sensor’s  range  switch  on  1X  (the  bar  magnet  field  is  much  stronger  than  the 
earth’s field), select AXIAL, and push the TARE button while the sensor is far away from 
the  bar  magnetic.  Start  taking  data,  and  move  the  sensor  towards  one  end  of  the  bar 
magnet,  with  the  probe  on  and  parallel  to  the  magnet  axis.    (Some  find  it  easier  to  hold 
the  sensor  fixed  and move  the magnet.)   On  your  graph,  notice  the  sign  of  the magnetic 
field when  the  sensor  points  towards  the North  pole  and when  the  sensor  points  towards 
the South pole. 

II: The radial component of the bar magnetic field   
Now  select  RADIAL  and  push  the  TARE  button.  Repeat  the  above  step,  keeping  the 
same orientation of the sensor and magnet.  Move the sensor from side to side. 

III.  Measuring the magnetic field of the Earth 

In Figure 11 a Cartesian coordinate system is shown for the TEAL classroom. 

Figure 11 Coordinate system for 
the TEAL classroom. 

The horizontal component of the Earth’s magnetic field  
Put  the  sensor’s  range  switch  on  10X,  select RADIAL  and  push  the  TARE  button.  Then 
watch how the measured component of the magnetic field changes as you move the probe 

E05-7


to  different  orientations.  Do  this  by  holding  the  sensor  by  the  connecting  cable  (to  the 
right,  just  out  of  the  range  of  Figure  8  above)  so  that  the  probe  points  vertically  down, 
and  let  the  sensor  rotate.    This  ensures  that  the  component  measured  is  horizontal. 
Identify  the direction  in  the x-y plane  in which  the horizontal component of  the magnetic 
field  is  largest.  (Unless  you’re  clever  about  how  you  “Tare”  the  sensor,  your  measured 
field  component  will  probably  NOT  be  symmetric  about  zero).  Mark  this  direction  as 
best you can, with a ruler or pencil on the tabletop or floor. 

The direction of the Earth’s magnetic field  
Keep  the  sensor’s  range  switch on 10X,  select AXIAL  and push  the TARE button. Move 
the  magnetic  field  sensor  in  a  circle  in  a  plane  perpendicular  to  the  floor  that  intersects 
the  x-y  plane  along  the  line  in  which  the  horizontal  component  of  the  magnetic  field  is 
largest.  Identify  the  direction  in  which  the  Earth’s  magnetic  field  points.    Do  this  by 
specifying the direction found in the part above, and by estimating the angle that the field 
direction makes with the vertical. 

Using the coordinate system in Figure 11, your group should then decide upon answers to 
the following questions: 

Question  5  (answer  on  your  tear-sheet  at  the  end): Based on your measurements, what 
angle does the horizontal component of the magnetic field make with the x-axis shown in 
Figure 11?  Give your answer in degrees; an approximate value is ok.  

Question  6  (answer  on  your  tear-sheet  at  the  end): Based on your measurements, what 
is  the  ratio of  the  vertical  to  the horizontal  component of  the Earth’s magnetic  field  in  classroom?
 An  approximate value is ok.   

Question 7  (answer on your tear-sheet at the end): 
The plot on the right shows the magnetic field of  
the Earth.  Boston’s latitude is about 45o 
(it’s closer to 42o, but we’re not that precise today). 
Does your answer agree with what you expect on 
the basis of looking at this plot?
