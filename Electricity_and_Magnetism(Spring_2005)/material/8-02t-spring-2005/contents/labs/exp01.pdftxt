Experiment 1: Using the TEAL Visualizations 

OBJECTIVES 
1.	 To explore the types of visualizations available through the TEAL website. 
2.	 To become familiar why they are there, which is to help you with geometry, 
mathematics, and physics. 
3.	 To explore how electrostatic forces hold matter together. 

INTRODUCTION 
Electromagnetism  is  a  subject  that  is  highly  complex  and mathematical,  and  we  hope  to 
help  you  develop  a  better  intuition  about  this  subject  through  passive  and  interactive 
visualizations, without the use of advanced mathematics.  

These visualizations are for three purposes. 

1.	 To  help  you  with  the  geometric  issues.    Because  electromagnetism  involves 
vector  cross  products,  the  subject  is  innately  three-dimensional,  and many  of  our 
animations are built using 3D tools. 

2.	 To  help  you  with  the  math.    We  do  a  lot  of  different  kinds  of  integrals  in 
electromagnetism (line, surface, and volume), many of which you do not see until 
the  end  of  18.02,  and  we  want  to  help  you  understand  those  using  visualizations 
of the mathematical concepts 

3.	 To help you with  the physics.  Electromagnet fields mediate  the  interaction of  the 
material  objects  that  produce  them  by  transmitting  energy  and  momentum 
between  those  objects.  In  particular,  fields  exert  a  tension  parallel  to  field  lines 
and a pressure perpendicular to field lines, and that is most obvious when you use 
an interactive applet demonstrating this phenomena. 

You will not have seen a lot of the materials we will discuss today, but don’t panic.  We 
just want to get you familiar with why the visualizations exist and what you can use them 
for as we proceed in the course.   
PLATFORMS 
We have three different kinds of animations, which run on the following platforms.   

1.	 Movie  files,  which  should  run  on  server,  Windows  PCs,  and  MACs  with  no 
additional software added to your computer. 

2.	 Java 3D Applets, which run on server, Windows PCs, and MACs.  If you want to 
run these on your own computer at home, you must download and install Java 3D 

E01-1


source code.  Directions for doing that are given at 
http://evangelion.mit.edu/802TEAL3D/visualizations/resources/download.htm. 

3.	 Macromedia  ShockWave  files,  which  run  only  on  Window’s  PCs  and  MACs. 
You must download the free Shockwave player from Macromedia’s website.  The 
first  time  you  try  to  play  one  of  our  Shockwaves  it  is  programmed  to  go  to  that 
website and download the player (assuming you want to of course). 

If  your  computing  resources  do  not  include  one  of  these  platforms,  use  the  server  PC 
Cluster.  This Cluster  is heavily used during  the  day  for  classes,  but  is  available  outside 
of scheduled classes. 

We  now  go  through  examples  of  each  of  these  kinds  of  visualizations  in  each  of  the 
categories we mentioned above—i.e. geometry, mathematics, and physics.   
PART 1.  GEOMETRY 
Navigation:   Go  to  the  8.02  public  web  page  at  http://web.mit.edu/8.02t/www.  The 
bottom link on the left will bring you to the Teal Visualization Page.   Once there, select 
Vector Fields from the links on the right.   

Figure 1  The TEAL Visualization page at http://web.mit.edu/8.02T/www/802TEAL3D/ 

Coordinate Systems 
Select  the  Coordinate  Systems  Shockwave  on  the  next  to  bottom  left  column  of  the 
Vector Fields page.  Once it loads you will see the following page: 

E1-2


The text on the right explains the purpose of the visualization.  To get instructions for the 
interface,  click  in  the  instructions  (popup  window).  To  get  a  full  screen  version  of  the 
shockwave, click on the fullscreen version link. 
Exercise 1:  Go to the full screen version of the shockwave do all of the following:   

1.  Explore all three of the coordinate systems contained in it.   

2.  Move your observation point around in all three directions.   

3.  Change your viewpoint by clicking and dragging in the window.   

4.  Move the viewpoint in and out using the keyboard controls. 
Question 1 (answer on the tear-sheet at the end): 
What  is  it  about  the  coordinate  axes  in  cylindrical  and  spherical  coordinates  that  makes 
those axes very different from the axes in a Cartesian coordinate system? 

PART 2.  MATHEMATICS 
Line Integrations 
Return  to  the  TEAL  visualization  page,  http://web.mit.edu/8.02T/www/802TEAL3D/ 
(see  Figure  1  above).  Now  choose  Electrostatics  from  the  links  on  the  right,  and  go  to 
the  Ring  of  Charge  Shockwave  (fifth  visualization  down  on  the  column  to  the  right). 
This is a visualization of the mathematical equation   

E01-3


G
E = ke ∫ dq rˆ	
2r 

(1.1)

applied  to  the  situation  where  we  have  a  ring  of  charge  and  the  integration  in  Equation 
(1.1)  is  a  line  integral  over  the  ring.    In  the  visualization we  have  broken  our  integration 
up  into a  sum over 30 charge elements on  the  ring, and do a  sum  to calculate  the electric 
field.  That is, we have replaced (1.1) with  
G
E = ke ∑ q  rˆi	
i
i  ri 
2 

(1.2)

Exercise  2:    Look  at  the  instructions  on  the  pop-up menu  and  then  go  to  the  full  screen 
version of the shockwave do all of the following:   

1.	 Move  your  observation  point  around  the  two  directions  in  the  plane  of  the  map. 
Be  careful  to  first  move  “down”,  as  there  is  a  bug  that  crashes  the  shockwave  if 
you move sideways to begin with.   
2.	 Turn  the  grass  seeds  map  on  and  off.    Note  that  the  vector  sum  of  our  thirty 
individual electric fields due to each charge element is always parallel to the grass 
seeds correlation direction, as it should be. 
3.	 Change your viewpoint by clicking and dragging in the window.  

4.	 Move the viewpoint in and out using the keyboard controls. 

5.	 Select  one  of  the  30  “charge  elements”  as  explained  in  the  instructions,  and  note 
what electric field it produces.   
Question  2 (answer  on  the  tear-sheet  at  the  end): What  is  the magnitude of  the  electric 
field right at the center of the circle of charge?  Why does it have that value? 

Grass seeds from analytic formulas 
Go to 
http://web.mit.edu/8.02t/www/802TEAL3D/visualizations/vectorfields/licapplet/licapplet 
.htm  and bring up the applet at that link by left clicking on the picture.   
Exercise 3: 
G 
1.	 The applet starts out with the vector function  F( ,x y ) = − y ˆi + x ˆj  in the boxes.  Hit 
the Grass Seeds button near the bottom of the right panel of the applet to see what 
this vector function looks like in grass seeds.

labeled  by  these  functions.  You  must  use  the  usual  symbolic  nomenclature,  e.g. 
“x*y”  to multiply x and y, “x^2” for  the square of x, and so on.  You can also use 
“sin(x)”, ln(x), and so on for various analytic functions.   

3.	 Use the “Examples” pull down menu to explore various pre-set functions.   

Note that the Weird Field Contest uses this applet. 

PART 3.  PHYSICS 
Charged Particle Motion in An Ion Trap 
Go to the page 

 http://web.mit.edu/8.02T/www/802TEAL3D/visualizations/electrostatics/Trap/trap.htm 

This is a visualization of the motion of 12 charges in an external electric field given by 
G 
E0 G
E = − 
r	
(1.3)
d 
That  is,  the electric field always points  toward the origin and it grows with distance from 
the origin as  the  first power of  the  radial distance.   This  field pushes  the positive charges 
toward  the  origin  with  a  force  that  grows  with  distance.    The  mutual  repulsion  of  the 
charges keeps them from collapsing to the origin.   

Exercise  4:    Look  at  the  instructions  on  the  pop-up menu  and  then  go  to  the  full  screen 
version of the shockwave and do all of the following:   

1.	 Let the charges settle down and then generate a surface of symmetry based on the 
particle positions (hit “s” on the keyboard) 

2.	

If  you  do  not  have  a  charge  at  the  center  of  a  ring  of  charges,  select  one  of  the 
charges on the ring and try to move it into the center to see if you can get a stable 
configuration with a charge at the center.  If you do have a charge at the center of 
the ring, select that charge and try to move it outward from the center so it sits on 
the ring. 

3.	 Add  additional  charges  and  see  how  many  you  have  to  add  until  you  get  two 
charges sitting inside a “cage.”  

Question 3 (answer on the tear-sheet at the end): How many additional positive charges 
do  you  have  to  put  in  your  “Ion  Trap”  shockwave  to  get  two  to  sit  in  the  center, 
surrounded by the rest?  What now is the total number?

Magnetic Levitation 
Go to 
http://web.mit.edu/8.02t/www/802TEAL3D/visualizations/magnetostatics/floatingcoilapp 
/floatingcoilapp.htm 

This applet illustrates the forces on a current carrying coil sitting on the axis of a 
permanent magnet. For current flowing in one direction in the coil the force on the coil 
will be upward, and if the current is strong enough the coil will levitate, floating on the 
magnetic fields of the coil plus the magnet. For the other direction of current the coil is 
attracted to the magnet.   
Exercise 5: 
1.	 Vary the current in the coil by using the slider at the upper right, and note how the 
field configuration changes. 

2.	 To  let  the  coil  move  under  the  effect  of  the  magnetic  field,  press  play  on  the 
“play” icon at the bottom of the left panel. 
A quantitative problem at this link gives you an idea of the currents you need to get 
levitation in the simple experiments which this applet illustrates.  
Question 4 (answer on  the  tear-sheet at  the end): How much current do you have to put 
through  the  coil  to  get  it  to  just  barely  levitate?    The  easiest  way  to  determine  this  is  to 
type  in  trial  current values  in  the box next  to  the  top  slider  and hit  return.   Give both  the 
sign  and  magnitude  of  the  current  necessary  to  levitate  the  coil.    You  need  be  only 
accurate to one amp.   

Note:  we will actually do this experiment (levitating a coil of wire) in Experiment 6.   

Question 5 (answer on the tear-sheet at the end): The two figures on the next page show 
the  magnetic  field  lines  of  the  magnet  and  the  coil  of  wire  for  the  two  directions  of  the 
current  in  the  coil.  Which  statement  below  is  true?   [Hint:  Faraday  through  trial  and 
error  deduced  that  field  lines  exert  a  tension  along  the  field  line  and  a  pressure 
perpendicular to the field line].   

a.	 The top figure on the next page corresponds to the field configuration when the 
coil was attracted to the magnet, and the bottom figure to when the coil was 
repelled by the magnet. 

b.	 The top figure on the next page corresponds to the field configuration when the 
coil was repelled by the magnet, and the bottom figure to when the coil was 
attracted to the magnet.
