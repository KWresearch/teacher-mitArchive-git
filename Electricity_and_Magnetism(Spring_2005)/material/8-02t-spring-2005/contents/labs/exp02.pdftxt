INTRODUCTION 

In  this  experiment, you’ll  set up  a horizontal parallel plate  capacitor  and  find  the voltage 
at  which  one  side  of  a  square  piece  of  aluminum  foil  of  known  weight  is  lifted  off  the 
bottom  plate,  creating  a  conducting  path  between  the  plates.   The  electric  force  then  just 
balances the force of gravity:

F  = − F

(2.1)

The electric field between  the plates  is proportional  to  the voltage difference between  the 
plates,  and  also  to  the  surface  charge  density  on  the  plates.  When  the  electric  field  is 
measured  in  SI  units,  the  constant  of  proportionality  between  the  field  and  the  surface 
charge  density  is  determined  by ε0 ,  the  permittivity  of  free  space.  From  the  relations 
between  measured  or  known  electrical  quantities,  material  properties  and  apparatus 
dimensions you can determine the constant ε .0

APPARATUS 

To  carry  out  the  experiment,  you  will  need  the  parallel  plates  that  are  made  from  two 
large  washers  ( 2.5-inch diameter).  The  washers  are  separated  by  3  pieces  of  insulating 
perf-board  having  a  thickness  of  approximately 1.5 mm ,  at  about  120°  separations,  as 
illustrated in Figure 1:  

E02-1 

Figure 1 Perf-board used as spacers on washer 

1.	 You  will  place  a  small  piece  of  aluminum  foil  on  the  lower  washer,  and  apply  a 
voltage  generated  by  HVPS  (high  voltage  power  supply)  across  the  washers.  You 
will  use  three  foils  of  different  thicknesses:  0.0003 in ,  0.0005 in  and  0.0007 in . 
Make sure the foils are flat.

The  circuit  should  be  set  up  as  shown  schematically  in  Figure  4  and  in  the 
photograph  shown  in  Figure  5.  The  lower washer  is  connected  to  the  negative  side 
of  the  HVPS,  and  the  upper  washer  to  the  positive  side,  connected  through  one 
multimeter set on  the +DC 1000 V scale.   This meter  is on  the  left  in both Figures 4 
and 5,  and  is  labeled  as meter  “B”  in Figure 5. A  second meter, on  the  right  in both 
Figures  4  and  5  and  labeled  as  meter  “A”  in  Figure  5,  is  used  to  read  the  HVPS 
output by connecting  the meter  leads across  the output of  the HVPS.   (Meter A  is  in 
“parallel” with the gap and meter B is in “series.”)

3.	 When the foil lifts and shorts the gap, meter B will register a voltage and meter A will 
register  a  drop  in  the  voltage. You want  to  determine  the  voltage  across  the  gap  just 
before the foil moves.  

•	 Watch  the multimeter readings as you slowly  increase  the voltage. When  the foil  lifts 
and  shorts  the  gap, meter A’s  reading will  drop. You will want  to  record  the  voltage 
on meter A just before the drop.

PROCEDURE 

Note:  The  HVPS  has  a  very  high  internal  resistance  so  you  cannot  get  a  serious  shock 
from  it.  The  experiment  depends  on  the  smoothness  and  cleanliness  of  the  washers  and 
the  cleanliness  of  the  foil.    This  is  because  charge  from  the  bottom  washer  must  be 
distributed to the foil. 

During the experimental runs, avoid  touching  the aluminum foil with your fingers so as 
to avoid getting any oil on the foil. Tweezers (provided) work well. 

E02-3


Using  the grid on  the paper accompanying  the foil  to obtain a square of uniform size (for 
all  three  thicknesses), cut a piece of  the  0.0003-in aluminum foil with scissors. Take care 
not to crumple the edges of the foil. 

The foil should be clean and flat (see Figures 2 and 3 above), but it also needs to be given 
a  rough  texture  to allow air  to pass under  the foil when  it  lifts off.   Take  the square piece 
of  aluminum  foil,  and  press  it  firmly  on  the  abrasive  cloth  (located  on  the  experiment 
board) with a piece of tissue (e.g., Kleenex,) between the foil and your finger. 

Use the tweezers to transfer the foil to the bottom washer, and making sure that the piece 
of foil remains flat. 

First  put  the  top  washer  in  place  and  just  turn  up  the  HVPS  all  the  way.    Watch  what 
happens to the foil; you should see the foil move in such a way as to “short” the gap (that 
is,  provide  a  path  for  conduction  of  charges  between  the  lower  and  upper  plates).  Turn 
down the voltage and repeat. You may have to tap or even remove the upper disk in order 
to have the piece of foil return to its flat position on the lower disk. 

Now, once  the apparatus  is working well, carefully and slowly  raise  the voltage and  read 
the  voltmeter  when  the  foil  lifts  off.  A  suggestion  is  for  one  member  of  each  group  to 
adjust  the HVPS  voltage while  reading meter A while  another member watches meter B 
and  the  third member  watches  the  piece  of  foil when  it  rises  to  short  the  gap.    You  will 
likely  want  to  develop  your  own  set  of  signals  to  let  the  other  members  of  your  group 
know what you observe. 

Since  the  reading  of  meter  A  will  drop  when  the  foil  shorts  the  gap,  you  want  to  make 
sure that you read meter A just before the gap is shorted.  This is tricky! 

Record  your  result  in  the  data  table  (see  the  tear-off  sheets  at  the  end  of  this  write-up). 
Repeat  for  a  total  of  three  measurements.    Then  cut  and  use  the  0.0005-in  and 
0.0007-in foils and repeat the above procedure for each case. 

ANALYSIS 

You want to equate the magnitudes of the gravitational and electric forces on the foil. The 
magnitude  of  the  gravitational  force  is  just  the  weight  of  the  foil.  The  density  of  the 
aluminum  foil material  is  ρ= 2.7 gm/cc ( 2.7 ×10  kg/m  ).  The  volume  of  the  foil  is  then

its area (A) times its thickness (t). Therefore the magnitude of the gravitational force is

To  find  the  electric  field,  treat  the  closely  spaced,  metal  portions  of  the  washers  as  two 
equal-sized but oppositely-charged parallel disks. The electric force on the foil will be the 
product  of  its  charge  and  the  electric  field  experienced  by  the  charge.  The  field  in  the 
 where  ∆V is the applied voltage and d is the spacing between 
capacitor is just  E = ∆V
 d
the plates. 

From  Equation  5.2.1,  Page  5-5  of  the  8.02  Course  Notes,  we  see  that  the  electric  field 
between two infinite oppositely-charged parallel plates is uniform and given by 

σE =
ε0 

, 

(2.3) 

where σ is  the  charge  density  (charge/area)  on  the  upper  plate.  Since  the  field  between 
the plates  is approximated as uniform,  the electric potential difference between  the plates 
(the voltage difference) is 

∆V E  d
. 
= 

 

(2.4)

The charge density σ is therefore 

. 

∆V 
= 
σ ε0  d 
To find  the electric force on  the foil, assume  that σ,  the charge density on  the foil,  is  the 
same as  that of  the  lower washer. Now we need  to bring up a subtle point, one explained 
in Section 4.4, “Force on a Conductor,” Page 4-22  in  the 8.02 Course Notes. By  thinking 
about  the  electric  field  from  the  charged  sheets  on  the  inner  surfaces  of  the  plates 
(positive on top and negative on the bottom) we come to the conclusion that half the total 
field  comes  from  the  upper  plate  and  half  from  the  lower  plate.  Charges  on  the  foil  feel 
only horizontal forces from other charges on the bottom plate, so the vertical force on the 
foil is due to the electric field of just the top charge sheet:

DATA COLLECTION 

We  have  set  up  an  Excel  spreadsheet  to  help  you  enter  and  analyze  data  from  this 
experiment.    Go  to  the  8.02 Web  Page,  "Current  Assignment",  and  download  the  Excel
spreadsheet  file  there,  saving  it  on  to  desktop.    If  you  are  in  the  afternoon  session,  save
over  the  spreadsheet  from  the  morning  session.   Open  the  spreadsheet  and  record  your
data in the tables provided.
