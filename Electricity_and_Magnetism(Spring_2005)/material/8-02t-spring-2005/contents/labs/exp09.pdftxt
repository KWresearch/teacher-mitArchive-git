OBJECTIVES 

Experiment 9: Faraday’s Law of Induction 

Spring 2005 

1.	 To  become  familiar  with  the  concepts  of  changing  magnetic  flux  and  induced 
current associated with Faraday’s Law of Induction. 

2.	 To  see  how  and why  the  direction  of  the magnetic  force  on  a  conductor  carrying 
an  induced  current  is  consistent  with  Lenz’s  Law.  Lenz’s  Law  says  that  the 
system always responds so as to try to keep things the same. 

OUTLINE 

This experiment consists of three parts: 

1.	 Prediction  of  the magnetic  flux  through  a  closed  contour  and  the  direction  of  the 
induced  current  in  a  wire  along  this  contour  associated  with  the  change  of  this 
flux with time as the wire moves, using Faraday’s Law. 

2.	 Qualitative  measurement  of  the  current  and  flux,  and  the  relationship  between 
these two. 

3.	 Qualitative  determination  of  the  direction  of  the  force  on  a  current-carrying 
conductor due to the induced current in a magnetic field. 

Part 1:  Predictions of Magnetic Flux and Induced Current 

The  questions  for  Part  1  refer  to  the  four  graphs  below.  Each  graph  is  a  qualitative  

depiction of some physical quantity as a function of time. 

To answer the questions, refer to the numbers that label each of the graphs.

Enter your predictions on the tear-sheet at the end of these instructions.

In  this  exercise  we  predict  the  time  dependence  of  the  current  in  a  coil  as  the  coil  is 
moved  up  and  down  past  a  stationary  permanent  magnet.    The  coil  and  magnet  are 
arranged as in the figure below. The North Pole of the magnet is on the top.

Prediction 1-1:    Suppose you move  the  loop from well above  the magnet  to well below 
the  magnet  at  a  constant  speed.    Predict  the  shape  of  a  graph  of  the  magnetic  flux

Prediction 1-2:    Suppose you move  the  loop from well above  the magnet  to well below 
the  magnet  at  constant  speed.    Predict  the  shape  of  a  graph  of  the  current  through  the 
loop  as  a  function  of  time,  taking  the  positive  direction  for  current  in  the  loop  to  be 
counter-clockwise when viewed looking down on the apparatus from above. 
 
Prediction  1-3:    Now  suppose  you  move  the  loop  from  well  below  the  magnet  to  well 
above  the magnet at a constant speed.    Predict  the shape of a graph of  the magnetic  flux

Part 2:  Measurements of Induced Voltage, Induced Current and Flux 

Download the exp09.ds DataStudio file from the "Current Assignment" Web Page. The
activity is already set up to graph induced current and magnetic flux as functions of time.
Take  the  coil  of  wire  from  your  experimental  set-up,  connect  it  to  the Current Sensor
and connect  the Current Sensor  to Analog Channel  “A” on  the Science Workshop 750
Interface (these last two steps may be done for you already). 
Recall  the  convention  for  the  Current  Sensor  and  DataStudio,  that  the  direction  of 
positive current  through  the Current Sensor  is from red  to black.  To allow  the correct 
interpretation of the sign of the current, carefully examine the way the wire loops in your 
coil.  The  leads  should  be  connected  so  that  they  lead  from  the  black  terminal  on  the 
Current  Sensor  to  the  coil,  around  the  coil  in  a  counterclockwise  direction  as  viewed 
from  above  and  then  back  to  the  red  terminal  on  the  Current  Sensor.  There  is  an 
arrow on the Current Sensor to remind you of this convention. 

Perform the two motions indicated above, and check your Predictions 1-1 through 1-4 for 
the current and the magnetic flux. 

The DataStudio activity  is set  to sample data  for a  time  interval of  2 seconds at a  rate of 
100 samples per second  (100 hertz).  A  recommended procedure  is  to start with  the coil 
at  the  top  of  the  plastic  tube,  begin  taking  data  by  pressing  Start,  and  moving  the  coil 
downward  as  evenly  (uniform  speed)  as  you  can  over  the  interval  of  2 seconds .  Then 
repeat, moving  the  coil  up.  DataStudio  should  plot  the  two measurements  on  the  same 
axes,  allowing  fairly  easy  comparison.  Make  the  scale  fit  each  of  the  graphs  in  the 
window  by  clicking  on  the  icon  at  the  upper  left  of  the  graph  window. 
If  something 
doesn’t  work  right  the  first  time,  or  even  the  second,  go  to  Experiment  from  the  main 
menu and select Delete ALL Data Runs. 
Another  suggestion  is  to  lift  or  lower  the  alligator  clips  that  are  connected  to  the  coil  as 
you move the coil up or down; this will prevent having the clips come off the wire coil or 
hitting the magnet (the clips are magnetic). 

Question 1 (answer on your tear-off sheet at the end): Did your predictions agree with 
your measurements? 

A Note On How We “Measure” Magnetic Flux: 
When you use  the DataStudio Activity,  the  top panel of  the graph window will  show  the 
measurement  of  I (t ) ,  and  the  bottom  panel  will  be  labeled  “Field  Flux”.  Here  we 
explain  how  the  values  displayed  on  the  bottom  panel  computed.  We  know  from 
Faraday’s Law that when an ohmic resistor of resistance  R  coincides with  the  loop  that 
bounds the surface through which the magnetic flux is determined for Faraday’s Law, 

E09-3


d
I R  = −  Φ mag  ,

and since we measure I (t ) ,we can compute  Φ mag ( ) by numerically integrating;

t

. 

The  DataStudio  software  is  capable  of  integrating I ( )t  and  displaying  the  integral  at  the 
same time that I (t ) is measured, and the integral is what is displayed in the bottom plot. 

Question 2 (answer on your  tear-off sheet at  the end): Note  that no matter how quickly 
or  slowly  you  move  the  coil  up  and  down  past  the  magnet,  as  long  as  you  go  from  far 
above to far below, or from far below to far above, the magnitude of the flux function will 
always attain the same maximum value in the process.

Prediction 3-1:  Suppose you move  the  loop from well above  the magnet  to well below 
the magnet at a constant speed.  From your predictions above of  the direction of current 
flow when  the  loop  is above  the magnet, should  the direction of  the magnetic  force point 
up or down? 

Prediction 3-2:  Suppose you move  the  loop from well above  the magnet  to well below 
the magnet at a constant speed.  From your predictions above of  the direction of current 
flow when  the  loop  is below  the magnet, should  the direction of  the magnetic  force point 
up or down? 

Prediction 3-3:  Suppose you move  the  loop from well below  the magnet  to well above 
the magnet at a constant speed.  From your predictions above of  the direction of current 
flow when  the  loop  is below  the magnet, should  the direction of  the magnetic  force point 
up or down? 

Prediction 3-4:  Suppose you move  the  loop from well below  the magnet  to well above 
the magnet at a constant speed.  From your predictions above of  the direction of current 
flow when  the  loop  is above  the magnet, should  the direction of  the magnetic  force point 
up or down? 

TESTING THE PREDICTIONS 

First,  take  off  your wristwatch.  Second,  connect  the  leads  to  the  coil,  forming  a  closed 
loop  (you  can  use  a  clip  from  the  Current  Sensor  leads  for  this,  but  take  the  Current 
Sensor out of the circuit). Move the coil up and down over the magnet.  Can you detect 
any  magnetic  force?  Try  moving  the  coil  more  quickly.    However,  the  quicker  you 
move  the coil,  the more  force you have  to apply  to  the coil, and  the harder  it might be  to 
detect the magnetic force. 

Question  3  (answer  on  your  tear-off  sheet  at  the  end):  Were  you  able  to  verify  your 
predictions? 

To obtain a more easily detected magnetic force, we need induced currents that are larger 
than  those  which  can  be  produced  in  the  coil.  The  aluminum  sleeve  that  is  part  of  the 
apparatus is conducting but non-magnetic. 

Verify  the  “non-magnetic”  property  of  aluminum  part  by  holding  the  sleeve  near  the 
magnet and noting the absence of attraction. 

Now,  try  moving  the  sleeve  up  and  down  on  the  Plexiglas  tube  past  the  magnet,  and 
G 
verify your predictions and summary above.  Feel the  I d s BG
× ext  force! 

Hold the sleeve at the top of the plastic column, and let it drop.  When you let the sleeve 
drop, the magnetic force opposed gravity (the external force).

Part 4:  The Structure of Space and Time 
Part 4:  The Structure of Space and Time 

Einstein starts his 1905 paper on special relativity with  the following paragraph (see “On 
The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies” by A. Einstein) 

“It  is known  that Maxwell's electrodynamics--as usually understood  at  the present  time--
when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which do not appear  to be  inherent 
in  the  phenomena.  Take,  for  example,  the  reciprocal  electrodynamic  action  of  a  magnet 
and  a  conductor.  The  observable  phenomenon  here  depends  only  on  the  relative  motion 
of  the  conductor  and  the magnet,  whereas  the  customary  view  draws  a  sharp  distinction 
between  the  two  cases  in which  either  the  one  or  the  other  of  these  bodies  is  in motion. 
For  if  the magnet  is  in motion and  the conductor at  rest,  there arises  in  the neighborhood 
of  the  magnet  an  electric  field  with  a  certain  definite  energy,  producing  a  current  at  the 
places  where  parts  of  the  conductor  are  situated.  But  if  the  magnet  is  stationary  and  the 
conductor  in  motion,  no  electric  field  arises  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  magnet.  In  the 
conductor,  however,  we  find  an  electromotive  force,  to  which  in  itself  there  is  no 
corresponding  energy,  but  which  gives  rise--assuming  equality  of  relative  motion  in  the 
two cases discussed--to electric currents of the same path and intensity as those produced 
by the electric forces in the former case.” 

What  he  is  saying  is  that  it  doesn’t make  any  difference  in  the  current  you  observe  as  to 
whether  the  magnet  is  stationary  and  the  coil  moves  or  the  coil  is  stationary  and  the 
magnet moves.  Check  to  see  that  this  is  correct.  That  is,  hold  the  coil  stationary  and 
move  the magnet  through  it,  and  see  if  you  observe  the  same  current  signature  as  in  the 
above experiments. 

Chose one: 

_____Current depends on relative velocity of coil and magnet only (Einstein right) 
_____Current depends on whether the magnet is at rest and the coil moves or 
            vice versa (Einstein wrong) 

In  the  last  class  before  the  exam  review,  we  will  show  you  why  this  observation  led 
Einstein  to  deduce  the  nature  of  space  and  time—i.e.,  space  contraction,  time  dilation, 
and all those other weird things. 
It all grew out of classical electromagnetism.
