Experiment 13: Interference and Diffraction 

 Spring 2005 

8.02	

OBJECTIVES 

1.	 To explore the diffraction of light through a variety of apertures using a laser pointer. 

2.	 To  measure  the  wavelength  of  the  laser  light;  the  spacing  between  the  tracks  of  an  audio 
compact disk (CD); and the thickness of a human hair. 

WARNING! The beam of  laser pointers  is so concentrated that it can cause real damage to 
your retina if you look into the beam either directly or by reflection from a shiny object. 

USING THE SPREADSHEET 

The data analysis for this experiment should be done using the Excel spreadsheet exp13.xls; your 
data should be entered  into  the appropriate places  in  this spreadsheet and  reproduced  in  the  tear-
off sheet.  Until you enter your data into the indicated boxes (or cells) in the spreadsheet, some of 
the displayed results will be of little use (there will be “#DIV/0!” in some cells). 

INTRODUCTION AND PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS 

Single-Slit Diffraction 
When  light  passes  through  a  small  opening,  secondary  waves  from  different  portions  of  the 
opening will generally travel different distances before hitting a wall or screen, so, although they 
were  in  phase  at  the  slit,  they  will  not  be  exactly  in  phase  at  the  screen.  Consequently,  the 
brightness  on  the  screen  will  vary  from  point  to  point.    “Secondary  waves”  and  Huygens’s 
Principle  are  discussed  in  the  8.02  Course  Notes,  Section  14.4,  and  the  variation  of  intensity 
with position on a screen is discussed in Section 14.5. 
Place  the  35-mm slide  containing  four  single  slits  with  different  widths  in  front  of  the  laser 
pointer.  The  widths  of  the  slits  are  printed  on  the  slide,  and  reproduced  in  Table  1.    You  will 
note that one side of the slide has attached magnets, and you might want to use these to attach the 
slide to the metal bracket in front of the aperture.  This will mean that the printed widths will not 
be readable, but this is not important. 
Note that Table 1 below gives the widths in microns,  µm , where 1 µm = 10-6 m = 10  mm .

Shine  the  laser pointer  through  the slide and examine  the patterns produced on a white card held 
some  distance  from  the  slide.  Notice  how  the  intensity  (brightness)  of  the  pattern  fades  with 
distance from the center. The dark spots are labeled by their order m, with m starting at 1 on each 
side  of  the  center;  these  are  the  “first-order minima”.  The maxima  are  similarly  labeled.  Notice 
that the center of the pattern, referred to as the “zeroth-order” maximum, is always bright.  

Question  1  (answer  on  your  tear-off  sheet  at  the  end): Why  is  the center of  the pattern always 
bright?

EXPERIMENT 

Part 1: Laser Wavelength 

Fasten a card  (preferably without a hole  in  it) with  the clips across  the wooden slide. Then place 
the  slide  in  its  slot  in  the  block  on  your  optical  bench,  and  shine  the  pointer  through  one  of  the 
slits (Figure 2).   

Figure 2 Optical Bench 

Slide  the  block  to  a  distance  D  of  at  least  30 cm  from  the  laser.  (Use  a  larger  distance  if  it  is 
dark  enough  at  your  table  to  still  see  the  patterns.)   Measure  the  distance  D  from  the  center  of 
the card  to  the slit. For each pattern A-D  in  turn, carefully put marks on  the card at  the positions 
of  the pair of first order minima and measure  the distance  ∆y (as  indicated  in Figure 1) between 
them.  Enter  your  results,  including  the  distance  D,  in  the  indicated  places  in  the  Excel 
Spreadsheet, and in the table in the tearoff sheet. 
The angle θ from the center of the slit to a minimum of order  m  (see Figure 1) is given by 

where  a  is the width of the slit. The angle θ is related to  D  and  ∆y by 

a sin θ= mλ 

tan θ= 

∆y  .

D  for the distance to the screen.)

The  spreadsheet  contains  the  needed  calculations,  both  trigonometric  and  algebraic,  needed  to 
convert  your  measured  values  of  ∆y to  a  wavelength.    The  wavelength  is  given  in  nanometers, 
nm,  1nm = 10-9 m = 10  mm = 10  µm  .  Optical  wavelengths  are  conventionally  given  in 
-3
-6 
nanometers. 

Part 2: Thickness of Human Hair 
What  would  happen  if  you  replaced  the  slit  (which  blocks  much  of  the  laser  beam  except  for  a 
narrow  open  strip), with  a  thin wire  or  human  hair  (which  blocks  little  of  the  laser  beam  except 
for a narrow opaque strip – just the reverse of a slit)? 

Figure 3 Hair diffraction 
To  find  out,  tape  a  short  piece  of  hair  (vertically,  as  indicated),  donated  by  a  group  member, 
across  the  hole  in  the wooden  slide  and  place  the  slide  in  its  slot  (see  Figure  3).  Tape  a  card  to 
the  far  end  of  the  optical  bench.  Shine  the  laser  at  the  hair  and  observe  the  pattern.  Surprised? 
(The  fact  that  the  pattern  is  virtually  identical  to  that  of  a  single  slit  is  an  example  of  a  general 
rule called Babinet’s principle.) 

Measurement  2: Mark  the  location of  the  two first-order minima on  the card. Then measure  the 
distance  ∆y between  these  minima  and  measure  the  distance  D  between  the  card  and  the  hair. 
Using  the  wavelength  of  the  laser  you  just  calculated,  compute  the  diameter  of  the  hair.  Enter 
your  measurements  in  the  indicated  places  in  the  spreadsheet,  and  record  your  results  in 
the tearoff sheet.

Now place the slide containing the pairs of slits on the apparatus, in a similar manner to that used 
for the single-slit slide, and observe the patterns produced. Notice the appearance of closely (and 
uniformly  spaced)  fringes.  The  fringes  as  a  whole  vary  in  intensity  in  much  the  same  way  that 
the  single-slit  patterns  did.  This  is  most  apparent  when  you  compare  the  difference  between 
patterns A and C (or B and D), which have the same distance d between the slits but different slit 
widths.  (The slit parameters are reproduced in Table 2 above.)

The width  ∆y of these fringes, that is, the distance between adjacent minima is approximately  

y∆ ≈

 

Dλ 
d 
where  D  is  the slit-to-screen distance, and  d  is  the separation between slits. (This  is accurate as 
long as  ∆ << D .)

Measurement  3:  Measure  the  width  of  a  group  of  fringes  produced  by  Pattern  A  of  slits, 
compute  the  average width of one  fringe  (the  spreadsheet will do  this  for you)  and  then use  this 
relationship to compute the wavelength of your laser. Compare with your previous measurement. 
Which  measurement  do  you  expect  to  be  more  precise?  Record  your  result  on  the  tearoff 
sheet.

Part 4: Grating 
Suppose  the  number  of  slits  is  increased  while  the  separation,  d  ,  between  them  remains 
constant.  Then  the  separation  between  fringes  remains  the  same  as  for  two  slits.  However,  the 
sharpness  and  visibility  of  the  fringes  increases.  This  is  the  principle  of  the  diffraction  grating. 
(See the 8.02 Course Notes, Section 14.8, for a further discussion of diffraction gratings.) 
If white light, which is a mixture of light with different wavelengths, strikes such a grating, each 
wavelength  will  diffract  in  a  slightly  different  direction  causing  rainbow  effects.  The  closely-
spaced  tracks  of  an  audio CD  constitute  a  reflection  grating,  but  the  interference  pattern will  be 
the same as that for a diffraction grating. 
Look at the reflection of the fluorescent lights in the room off the surface of the CD. You should 
see  dominant  red,  green  and  violet  bands  that  correspond  to  the  wavelengths  emitted  by  the 
mercury vapor  inside  the  lamps.  (The  spectrum of  an  incandescent  light bulb or  the  sun  is much 
more continuous – try it with your own CD at home.)

Figure 4: CD diffraction grating 

CD Track Spacing 
Since you now know  the wavelength of your  laser, you can use your CD as a grating  to measure 
some  very  small  distances.  Place  an  audio  CD  in  one  of  the  slots  on  the  block  on  your  optical 
bench  (see Figure  4). Attach  a  card with  a  punched  hole  to  the wooden  slide  leaving  the  central 
hole  unobstructed.  (If  you  can  only  place  the  central  hole  so  that  some  if  not  most  of  the  laser 
light  passes  through,  you  should  still  be  able  to  obtain  the  desired  results.)    Place  the  wooden 
slide in its slot on the block. Turn on your laser and observe the diffraction pattern reflected onto 
the cards. (Be careful not to reflect the laser into anyone’s eye.) Because the distance  d  between 
the tracks is so small, the pattern you see is much wider than the one you observed earlier for one 
or two coarse slits, but the maxima are now much brighter and easy to see. Make small marks on 
the card at  the  location of  the  first-order maxima on each  side of  the center. For a grating, either 
a  diffraction  grating  or  a  reflection  grating,  the  angle  of  the maximum  for  a  given  order  m  and 
wavelength  λ is 

and 

d sinθ= mλ 

tan θ= 

∆y  .

Measurement  4: Measure  the distance  ∆y between  the  two  first-order maxima on  either  side of 
the  central  maximum.  Measure  the  distance  D  from  the  center  of  the  card  to  the  CD.    Enter 
these  measurements  in  the  indicated  places  in  the  spreadsheet,  and  record  the  calculated 
value of  d  on the tearoff sheet.
