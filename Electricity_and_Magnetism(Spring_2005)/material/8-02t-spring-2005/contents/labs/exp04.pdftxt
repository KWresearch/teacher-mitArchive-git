INTRODUCTION 

OHM’S LAW 

Our main purpose  in  the Ohm’s Law part of  the experiment  is for you  to gain experience 
with the 750 Interface and the DataStudio software, including the signal generator for the 
750.  We want  you  to  hook  up  a  circuit  and  a  voltage measuring  device  and  look  at  the 
voltage across resistors, and get used  to what a real circuit  looks  like.    We will have you 
confirm the relation V = IR in the course of this exercise. 

CAPCACITORS 

(See the 8.02 Course Notes, Section 5.1, for a more extensive discussion of capacitors 
and capacitance.) 

In  the  Capacitor  part  of  this  experiment  our  goals  are  more  complicated  because 
capacitors  are  more  complicated.    Capacitors  are  circuit  elements  that  store  electric 
charge  Q , and hence energy, according to the expression 

Q C  V  
,	
=

(4.1)

where  V  is  the  voltage  across  the  capacitor  and  C  is  the  constant  of  proportionality 
called  the  capacitance.    The  SI  unit  of  capacitance  is  the  farad  (after  Michael  Faraday), 
1 farad = (1 coulomb)/(1 volt).  Capacitors  come  in many  shapes  and  sizes,  but  the  basic 
idea  is  that  a  capacitor  consists  of  two  conductors  separated  by  a  spacing, which may  be 
filled  with  an  insulating  material  (dielectric).    One  conductor  has  charge  +Q  and  the 
other conductor has charge  −Q .  The conductor with positive charge is at a higher voltage 
then  the  conductor with  negative  charge. Most  capacitors  have  capacitances  in  the  range 
between picofarads  (1p F  = 1 0   F )  and millifarads  (1m F  = 1 0   F  = 1 0 0 0  µ F ) .

CHARGING A CAPACITOR 
 
Consider  the circuit shown  in Figure 1. The capacitor  is connected  to a voltage source of 
constant  emf  E .  At  t = 0 ,  the  switch  S  is  closed.  The  capacitor  initially  is  uncharged,

The  expressions  for  the  charge  on,  and  hence  voltage  across,  a  charging  capacitor,  and 
the current through the resistor, are derived in the 8.02 Course Notes, Section 7.6.1.  This 
RCτ=

 for  the  time  constant  of  either  a  charging  or 
discharging RC circuit.

DISCHARGING A CAPACITOR 

Suppose we  initially charge a capacitor  to a charge  Q0 through some charging circuit. At 
time  t = 0  the switch is closed (Figure 4). The capacitor will begin to discharge. 

The expressions for the charge on, and hence voltage across, a discharging capacitor, and 
the current through the resistor, are derived in the 8.02 Course Notes, Section 7.6.1.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
 
A. AC/DC Electronics Lab Circuit Board 
1.  In  this  experiment we  use  the  signal  generator  function  of  the  750  as  a  “battery” 
that  turns on and off.   The Signal Generator ports of  the 750 Interface are  the  two 
ports  on  the  right  face  of  the  Interface,  labeled OUTPUT,  as  shown  in  Figure  6.  
Locate these ports on your 750 Interface.

Interface  to  the  banana  jacks  on  the  lower  right  corner  of  the AC/DC Electronics 
Lab circuit board (see locations D and E, at the lower right in Figure 7 below).

Circuit Board 

3.	 Place  a 100-Ω resistor  in  the  pair  of  springs  nearest  to  the  banana  jacks  at  the 
lower  right  corner  on  the AC/DC Electronics Lab.   The  springs  are  connected  by 
conductors  to  the  jacks.   The  color-code  for  a  100-Ω  resistor  is  brown-black-
brown. 

B.	  Voltage Sensor Setup: 
The Voltage Sensor should be plugged into Analog Channel B of your 750, as shown in 
Figure 8.

B. DataStudio File 

Right click on the  exp04.ds file from the website and download it to your desktop. Your 
file  has  an  Experiment  Setup  display,  a  Signal  Generator  display,  a  Signal 
Generator  Voltage  graph  display  and  a  Sensor  Voltage  and  Output  Current  graph 
display (see Figure 9). 

Figure 9  DataStudio Activity display.  We plot the output voltage from the signal 
generator in the graph on the left (in green) , the voltage sensor reading in the upper 
right panel (in red), and the output current in lower right panel (in blue). 

Graphs: Here’s how  to  set up  the graphs above  if you ever need  to  (it  should already be 
set up  for you here). Grab  the Output Voltage  icon  in  the Data window and drag  it  into 
the Graph  icon.  This  will  create  the  Signal  Generator  Voltage  vs.  Time  graph.  Grab 
the  Voltage,  ChB  icon  in  the  Data  window  and  drag  it  into  the  Graph  icon.  This  will 
create  a  Voltage  Sensor  vs.  Time  graph.  Grab  the  Output  Current  (A)  icon  in  the 
Data  window  and  drag  it  into  the  Voltage,  ChB  graph  icon.  This  will  create  a  single 
display window with graphs of both the voltage sensor voltage and the output current. 

Sampling  Options:  Click  on  the  drop-down  menu  labeled  Experiment  on  the  top  tool 
bar.  In  the  Experiment  menu,  click  on  Set  Sampling  Option  to  open  the  Sampling 
Options  dialog.  Check  that  the  Delay  Choice  is  on  None.  Check  that  the  Automatic 

E04-6


Stop choice  is Time with  3.5 seconds  in  the window.   If  these options are not set  in  this 
manner, set them to these values. 

C.  Signal Generator: 
We  use  the  signal  generator  in  this  experiment  as  a  “battery”  that  turns  on  and  off  in  a 
step  function  fashion.    To  do  this,  in  the  Signal  Generator  dialog  (Figure  10)  we  have 
chosen “Pos(itive) Square Wave Function.” 
The  Amplitude  has  been  adjusted  to  4.000 V  ,  the  Frequency  to  0.400 Hz and  the 
Sampling  Rate  to 1000 Hz . We  chose  the  output  data  that  you  will  record  by  clicking 
the plus button (+) beside Measurements and Sample Rate on the Signal Generator 
dialog  and  clicking  the  appropriate  Measure  Output  Voltage  and  Measure  Output 
Current buttons.

Part I:  Ohm’s Law--Measuring Voltage, Current, and Resistance 

In  this part of  the experiment, you will assemble a circuit with  resistors, and measure  the 
voltage drops across various elements in the circuit, using the Positive Square Wave from 
the Signal Generator as a voltage source.  

First, you  should have  a 100-Ω  resistor  in  the pair of  springs nearest  to  the banana  jacks 
at  the  lower  right corner on  the AC/DC Electronics Lab.  Place  the  leads  for  the voltage 
sensor in parallel with the 100-Ω  resistor.  We use the Measure Output Current feature 
of  the  Signal  Generator  to  measure  the  current  in  this  series  circuit  (this  is  an  internal 
measurement made  in  the  signal generator  circuit,  so we do not have  to have  an  external 
ammeter in the circuit to measure the total current).   

Press Start to begin taking data.  Once the data has been recorded, scale the plots to fit 
the graph screens by clicking on the first icon on the left at the top of the Graph window 
(the Scale to Fit icon).  Your DataStudio window should resemble that shown above 
(Figure 9). 

Question 1 (answer on your tear-sheet at the end):  What is the ratio of the maximum 
voltage measured by the voltage sensor to the maximum current measured in the circuit 

E04-7


when the voltage sensor is placed across your 100-Ω  resistor?  Is this ratio what you 
expect?  Explain. 

Now  take  the  second 100-Ω  resistor  and  put  it  in  parallel  with  the  first 100-Ω  resistor. 
Leave  the  voltage  sensor  so  that  it  is  measuring  the  voltage  across  the  two  resistors  in 
parallel.  Press Start  to begin  taking data (if you want  to get  rid of  the previous data run, 
go to Experiment on the top toolbar and choose Remove all Data runs). 

Question 2 (answer on your tear-sheet at the end):  What is the ratio of the maximum 
voltage measured by the voltage sensor to the maximum current measured in the circuit 
when the voltage sensor is placed across your two 100-Ω  resistors in parallel?  Is this 
ratio what you expect?  Explain. 

Part II.  Measuring Voltage and Current in an RC Circuit 

In  this  part  of  the  experiment,  you  will  assemble  an  RC  circuit,  and  apply  a  signal 
generator voltage (as above) in a manner that alternately charges the capacitor and allows 
the  capacitor  to  discharge  (the  Square Wave  output),  as  if we  had  a  “battery”  turning  on 
and  off.  DataStudio  will  be  used  to  determine  the  time  constant  of  the  circuits,  both 
graphically and analytically. 

The resistor/capacitor combination we use  is  two 100-Ω resistors  in series with a  330-µF 
capacitor.    On  the  Circuit  Board  (Figure  7)  connect  the 100-Ω  resistors  in  series  (color­
code  brown-black-brown)  and  in  series  with  the  capacitor,  using  the  springs,  so  that  the 
three  elements  form  a  closed  loop;  remember,  for  a  series  circuit  the  current  is  the  same 
in each element. 

We want  to measure  the voltage  across  the  capacitor  as well  as  the  current  in  the  circuit. 
In  order  to  do  this,  we  must  connect  the  Voltage  Sensor  in  parallel  with  the  capacitor, 
with  one  clip  at  each  end  of  the  blue  capacitor  leads.    Since  we  are  dealing  with  series 
circuits, we again use the Measure Output Current  feature of the Signal Generator to 
measure the current in this series circuit.   

We  use  the  same  DataStudio  file  exp04.ds  from  the  web  page  that  we  used  in  the  first 
part of the experiment.  If you want to get rid of old data runs, choose Experiment in the 
upper toolbar and Erase all Data  runs.  Press  Start to begin taking data.  Once the data 
has been  recorded,  scale  the plots  to  fit  the graph  screens by clicking on  the  first  icon on 
the left at the top of the Graph window  (the Scale to Fit icon).

DATA ANALYSIS FOR RC CIRCUIT MEASUREMENTS 

In  this  part  of  the  experiment,  you  are  asked  to  measure  the  time  constant  for  an  RC 
circuit as described above. 

In  setting up  the  apparatus, you  should  record data  for  two 100-Ω resistors  in  series with 
the  330-µF  capacitor.    You  are  asked  to  measure  the  time  constant  using  both  of  the 
methods described below.   

Method  1:    The  current  in  the  discharging  circuit with  initial  value  I0  at  t = 0  decreases 
exponentially  in  time,  I ( ) = I e 
,  where τ= RC  is  the  time  constant,  as 
t 
= I 0  e− t 
τ

described above in Equation (4.3) and in the 8.02 Course Notes, Section 7.6. 

You  can  determine  the  time  constantτ graphically  by  measuring  the  current  I (
fixed time  t1  and then finding the time  t1  + τ such that the current has the value 

)  at  a

In  the  current  graph,  enlarge  the  Graph  window  as  desired  by  clicking  and  dragging 
anywhere on the edge of the graph window, or maximize the window. Click on the Zoom 
Select  (fourth  from  the  left)  icon  in  the Graph  icon bar  and  form  a box  around  a  region 
where  there  is  exponential  decay  for  the  current.  Click  on  Smart  Tool  (sixth  from  the 
left)  icon.  Move  the  crosshairs  to  any  point  (at  some  time  t1 )  on  the  exponentially 
decaying  function  (he  Smart  Tool  display  will  become  colored  when  the  crosshairs  are 
on a data point).  Record the values of the time  t1  and the current  I1 .

Multiply  the  current value  (displayed  in  the Smart  Tool  feature) by  e −1  = 0.368 .  (If you 
don’t have a  familiar calculator with you,  the  laptop should have  this  feature; go  to Start 
at  the  lower  left,  and  follow  the  prompts  through  Accessories  and  Calculator.  The 

E04-9


DataStudio  calculator  can  be  used,  but  its  use  for  basic  arithmetic  may  seem  somewhat 
cumbersome.)    Use  the  Smart  Tool  to  find  the  new  time  t1  + τ such  that  the  current  is 
down  by  a  factor  of  e −1  = 0.368 .  Of  course,  you  won’t  find  a  data  point  with  the  exact 
value  of  I ( t  +τ) = (0.368) I  ;  you  may  have  to  make  an  estimate,  possibly  from  the

graph. 

Determine the time constant and record your value. 

Questions 3 (answer on your tear-sheet at the end): 

a.	 What  is your measured value using Method 1  for  the  time constant  for our circuit 
(two 100-Ω resistors in series with each other and with a  330-µF  capacitor)? 

b.	 What is the theoretical value of the time constant for your circuit? 

c.	 How does your measured value  compare  to  the  theoretical value  for your  circuit? 
/τtheoretical  .
Express as a ratio, τ 
measured 

Method  2:  A  second  approach  is  to  take  the  natural  logarithm  of  the  current,  using  the 
facts that  ln ( e 
) = − t τ and   l n (a b) = l n  a + l n  b . This leads to 
− t τ

l n  ( I ( ) ) = l n  ( I e 
t 
−t τ	
0 

) = l n  ( I  ) + l n  ( e 
−t τ
0	

) = l n  ( I  ) − t τ. 
0 

(4.5)

Thus,  the  function  l n  ( I ( ) ) is  a  linear  function  of  time.  The  y-intercept  of  this  graph  is
t 
(
) and its slope is  slope 
ln  I 0 
. Thus, the time constant can be found from the slope 
1 τ= − 
of  ln(I )  versus time according to 

τ= − 1 / s l o p e	

(4.6) 

We now want  to calculate and plot  ln(I )  versus  time,  so  that we  can  find  this  slope. 
This is a quantity which we do not measure, but which we can calculate given our current 
measurement.  Click on Calculate from the Menu bar (see Figure 12).

of  the Calculator display. A Variables  request now  appears  (see Figure 13),  asking you 
to 

Please define variable “I” 

When  you  click  on  the  icon  just  to  the  left  of  Please  define  variable  “I”,  a  dropdown 
menu  appears. Click  on Data Measurement;  a window  appears  titled  Please  Choose 
a Data Source (Figure 14).  Click on Output Current [A] and OK. 

Figure 14 Please Choose a Data Source window 

E04-11 

We  have  now  defined  the  variable  y  =ln(I),  and we want  to  plot  it  as  a  function  of  time. 
In  the Data window,  a  calculator  data  type  should  have  appeared with  the  text  y  =ln(I). 
Drag that calculator icon to the Graph icon in the Display window. A fairly complicated 
graph  (most  of which  is  no  use  to  us,  as  the  current  is  so  small  for most  of  the  run) will 
appear  (see Figure 15 below).   Use  the Zoom Select  to  isolate  the  small amount of data 
where  the  function  is  linear.  You  should  see  fluctuations  in  the  data  due  to 
approximations associated with the sampling rate.  Use the mouse to highlight a region of 
data  where  there  are  the  smallest  fluctuations.  You  can  fit  the  highlighted  data  in  that 
region  using  the  Fit  button  (eighth  icon  from  the  left  in  your  upper  tool  bar  in  the  graph 
window).  Click on that icon and scroll down and click to Linear Fit. 

Record the value of the slope.  Use your value of the slope to calculate the time 
constant. 

Questions 4 (answer on your tear-sheet at the end): 

a.	 What  is your measured value using Method 2  for  the  time constant  for our circuit

IF YOU’D LIKE TO DO MORE … 

Try a different combination of resistors, for example just use one 100  ohm resistor or use 
two  100  ohm  resistors  in  parallel  rather  than  in  series.    Use  either  one  of  the  methods 
described above to determine the RC time constant with this new equivalent resistance.   

Does  your  new  time  constant  agree  with  what  you  expect  theoretically?    If  your  graphs
