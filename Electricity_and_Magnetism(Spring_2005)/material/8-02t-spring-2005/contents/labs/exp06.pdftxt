field 
.  For  a  more  detailed  discussion  of  the  forces  on  current-carrying  wires  of 
ext 
different configurations, see the 8.02 Course Notes, Section 8.3. 

For  the  first  part  of  this  experiment  you  need  to  know  the  magnetic  field  due  to  a 
permanent magnet. The  field  lines  from  this magnet are similar  to  those you  found  in  the 
previous  experiment,  where  the  field  lines  due  a  bar  magnet  were  mapped.    For  the 
purposes  of  making  Predictions  1-5  below,  you  may  assume  that  the  field  lines  of  the 
rare-earth magnet are similar to those shown for a tightly-wound solenoid, as presented in 
the 8.02 Course Notes, Section 9.4, and Figure 9.4.1, reproduced here: 

Figure 1 Magnetic Field lines due to a tightly-wound coil. 

PREDICTIONS 
For  this experiment, you are asked  to make  several predictions  regarding  the direction of 
the  force  on  a  current-carrying  in  the  field  of  a  permanent  magnet.    Then,  you  will  be 
asked to confirm your predictions.

(Please  reproduce  your  predictions,  either words  or  figures,  on  the  tear-sheet  at  the  end 
of these instructions.) 

A.  Magnetic Force on a Straight Wire 

Prediction  1  (answer  on  your  tear-sheet 
at the end): Suppose the rare-earth magnet 
in  your  experimental  setup  has  its  North 
magnetic  pole  on  top.    If  a wire  is  located 
above  the  magnet  as  shown  in  the  figure, 
with  the  current  in  the  wire  moving  from 
left  to  right,  predict  the  direction  of  the 
force  on  the wire,  and  draw  it  on  Figure  2 
and on the tear-sheet. 

Prediction  2  (answer  on  your  tear-sheet  at 
the  end):  Suppose  you  now  place  the  wire 
in  front  of  the  magnet  in  its  midplane,  as 
shown  in  the  figure,  with  the  current  in  the 
wire  again  running  from  left  to  right.    Now 
predict the direction of the force on the wire, 
and  draw  it  on  Figure  3  and  on  the  tear-
sheet. 

Figure 2 A wire located above the magnet.

Figure 3 A wire in front of the magnet. 

Prediction 3 (answer on your tear-sheet at the end):  Suppose you place the wire behind 
the magnet  in  its mid-plane, with  the  current  in  the wire again  running  from  left  to  right. 
Now what is the direction of the force on the wire?   Is it into the page or out of the page? 

B.  Magnetic Force on a Coil of Wire 

Prediction  4  (answer  on  your  tear-sheet  at  the  end): Suppose  you  now  place  a  circular 
coil  carrying  current  above  the  magnet  and  coaxial  with  it,  see  Figure  4(a),  with  the 
current  in  the  coil  running  so  that  current  moves  counterclockwise  as  seen  from  above.  
Will the coil of wire be attracted to or repelled by the permanent magnet, or will it feel no 
force  at  all;  that  is,  will  the  force  on  the  coil  be  upwards,  downwards,  or  zero? 
(Remember, the North pole of the magnet is assumed to be on the top.)

(a) counterclockwise, and (b) clockwise, as seen from the top. 

 

 
Prediction 5  (answer on your  tear-sheet at  the end): Suppose that the current in the coil 
runs so  that current moves clockwise as  seen  from  the  top,  see Figure 4(b).   Will  the coil 
of wire be attracted or repelled by the permanent magnet, or will it feel no force at all?  
 
 
 
 
PROCEDURE 
(cid:71)
extB
The source of the external field 
 will be a strong “Rare-Earth” magnet and the current 
in the wires will be provided by two 1.5-volt  batteries. 
THE RARE EARTH MAGNET IS EXTREMELY STRONG, STRONG ENOUGH TO 
WIPE YOUR CREDIT CARDS, STOP YOUR WATCH, OR DO SERIOUS DAMAGE TO 
YOUR COMPUTER, IF IT COMES CLOSE ENOUGH TO ANY OF THESE.   
DO NOT REMOVE THE MAGNET FROM ITS 
PROTECTIVE PLASTIC CASE! 
You  will  use  the  AC/DC  Electronics  Board  to  mount  two 1.5-volt  batteries,  which  will 
provide  the  current  for  the  wires.    You  will  use  a  piece  of  wire  about  60  cm  (2  ft)  in 
length  and  a  coil  of wire with  22  turns  (different  coils might  have  a  different  number  of 
turns).  You  will  compare  your  above  predictions  by  finding  the  directions  of  the  forces 
you find acting on the wires (Predictions 1-5) in the various configurations. 
 
EXPERIMENT 
 
Direction of the Forces 
 
Perform  the  five  experiments  needed  to  verify  Predictions  1-5  above,  using  the  only 
batteries,  your  length  of  wire,  and  coil  of  wire  to  see  if  reality  agrees  with  your 
predictions.    Use  leads  to  and  from  the  “switch”  on  the  AC/DC  board,  indicated  by  the 
red  button.    This will  allow  you  to make  the  connections without  having  the  current  run 
until  you’re  ready  to  find  the  force  direction.    Since  we  are  directly  shorting  out  the 

 

E06-3

batteries to get a high current, it is important that you USE THE SWITCH TO PULSE 
THE SYSTEM MOMENTARILY so that our batteries don’t run down rapidly.   

In looking for the force on a small piece of wire, bend your long wire into a long U shape 
so  that  there  is  plenty  of  length  of  wire  to  allow  movement  of  the  wire  due  to  the 
magnetic  force.   You  should be able  to hold  the  leads  (the alligator clips)  to  the wires on 
the  board  with  the  magnet,  in  such  a  way  that  a  portion  of  the  wire  is  near  but  not 
touching  the  plastic  casing.  This  way,  you’ll  be  able  to  see  the  wire  deflect  and  so 
determine the direction of the force. 

For  the  coil,  the  direction  of  the  force  is  much  easier  to  determine.    In  fact,  with  the 
proper direction of the current and position of the wire, you might even be able to get the 
coil  to  almost  levitate  (stable  levitation  is  known  to  be  impossible  when  only  magnetic 
forces and gravity are acting). 

Question  1  (answer  on  your  tear-sheet  at  the  end):  If  any of your Predictions 1-5 were 
incorrect, briefly explain why.
