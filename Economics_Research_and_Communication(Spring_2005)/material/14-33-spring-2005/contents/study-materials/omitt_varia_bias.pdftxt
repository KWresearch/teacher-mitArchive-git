Suppose that the true relationship between education and wages is as follows: 

wi	 = α+ β ed i  + γ Z i  +ν ability  + ε i  ,
i 
where Z is a vector of control variables such as age, race, gender, etc. 

To simplify, let’s forget about the control variables. So let us call the “true” 

relationship: 


(1) 	 wi  = α+ β ed i  +ν ability  + ε i
i 
1 

But suppose we cannot measure ability (or we don’t know it should be in the 

regression), so it is left out and we estimate: 


(2) 	 wi  = α+ β 2 ed  + ε i
i 

How will that affect our estimate of β? Recall the formula for β: 

(3)β=

but note that, even though we have assumed the wrong functional form for w, it will 
be given by the true relationship, so we must plug in the true equation:

Since α is a constant, it doesn’t covary with anything, so the first term is zero. 
According to the assumptions of OLS  Cov (ε , ed ) = 0 . Lastly, note that the 
cov(ed,ed)=var(ed). 

So, canceling terms: 

ability 
Cov 
ed

(
(4)β  = β +ν

Var 
ed 
)
( 

This implies that β2  is equal to the true β, plus a bias term.  

What is the expected sign of the bias? Well, recall that ν is the coefficient on ability 
in the wage regression, so from the same formula we had for β (equation 3): 

(5) ν = 

ability 
Cov 
w 
(
)
, 

ability 
Var 
)

( 

so ν is positive if ability and wages are positively correlated (since the variance of any 
variable is always positive).  

So, the sign of the bias here depends on the correlation between education and ability. 
There is some debate about this in the labor economics literature. You might assume 
that higher ability people get more education, maybe because they are more 
motivated. However, high ability people have higher wages for each level of 
education than low ability people, so they can make the same money for less 
education. 

Let’s assume that Cov(ability, ed) > 0. Then, since ν > 0 and Var(ed) > 0, the bias is 
positive and our estimated β2  is larger than the true β. 
What is happening here? Since ability matters for both wages and education, but 
ability is left out of the equation, β gets the credit for both education and ability. We 
will erroneously find that education matters more for wages because more educated 
people have higher ability.  

When is there no bias? 
This is clear from the omitted variables bias formula. If the omitted variable is 
uncorrelated with the outcome variable or with the included independent variable 
then the bias is zero. Why will there be no bias if ability is uncorrelated with 
education, even if ability is correlated with wages and is left out of the equation? 
Because, even though the regression equation is mis-specified, β will not get the 
credit for the ability variable because ability and education are uncorrelated.  
How does this relate to the problem set? 
Recall that the problem set asked about OVB in a regression of changes in infant 
mortality rates on changes in TSPs at the county level. Any omitted variable that 
would cause bias must be a county level variable that is correlated with changes in 
both of these variables.
