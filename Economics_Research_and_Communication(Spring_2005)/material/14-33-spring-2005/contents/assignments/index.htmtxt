Problem Set
There is one problem set (PDF) in the class, with an associated data file
[tspsimr7172v2.dta (DTA)]. You may find the statistical software package
STATAÂ® to be useful in solving the problems. A STATAÂ® tutorial is available
in the study_materials section.
Research Paper
The main project will be a paper that should be 10-15 pages of text (12 point
Times New Roman with 1 inch margins), plus tables and figures. The paper will
report on original economic research that you perform over the course of the
semester. There will be a number of opportunities to make presentations on your
research throughout the course of the semester.

        The class will be divided into research teams that will meet separately for the
        remainder of the semester.
        HalfÂ of the members of each research team will present their initial ideas for
4       a paper. A maximum of 10 minutes will be allotted to each presentation and this
        will include discussion of the research idea by other members of the research
        team.
        Half of the members of each research team will present their initial ideas for a
5       paper. A maximum of 10 minutes will be allotted to each presentation and this
        will include discussion of the research idea by other members of the research
        team. (cont.)
        Research plan is dueÂ this week at 5 pm for half the members of each team. The
        research plan will be distributed electronically to the instructors and the
        members of your research team. All team members are expected to read the plan
6       before class and be prepared to comment on it.

        These team members will present their research plan to their teammates in class.
        The presentations will last 10 minutes and an additional 5 minutes will be
        allotted for discussion.

        First draft of the paper is due this week at 5 pm for half the members of each
        team. This draft will be distributed electronically to the instructors and the
        members of your research team.

        The draft should begin to resemble your full paper. In particular, it should
        include each of the sections that your final paper will have. For the sections
        that are not yet complete, you should include an outline of what is coming. It
        should also include preliminary versions of your tables and figures. Many of you
        will not have completed the analysis yet and, if you are in this situation, you
        should include blank tables/figures and/or outlines of what they will look
10      like.Â 

        It is essential that you read your classmates' papers once they are posted and
        be prepared to comment on them in class. Your grade depends on your contribution
        to your classmates' research projects.

        If you turn in a draft for this week, then you will also be expected to make
        your final presentation. You should plan on presenting your entire project in
        roughly 12 minutes. There will then be a brief discussion where your fellow
        students, the instructor, and TA will provide feedback on how to improve your
        paper. This will be the last opportunity to get feedback in the classroom.
