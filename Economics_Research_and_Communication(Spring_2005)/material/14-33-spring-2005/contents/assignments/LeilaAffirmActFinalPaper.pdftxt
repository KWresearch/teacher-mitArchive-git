The Effects of Affirmative Action on Diversity and Student Quality 
I. Introduction and Motivation 
Affirmative action has been a controversial aspect of hiring and admissions decisions in 
America since the civil rights movement of the 1960s.  Whether and to what extent minority 
students should be given preference in admissions decisions has been the source of much debate 
and legal action within the last decade.  Given the lower average standardized test scores and 
lower grade point averages of minority students, many argue that some preferential action is 
necessary to achieve a proportionate representation of minority students in elite colleges. 1   The 
contentious question of when and how race can be considered in admissions decisions came up 
recently in the widely-publicized, contentious challenge to the University of Michigan’s point-
based affirmative action system in the US Supreme Court.  President Bush argued that 
University of Michigan’s policy amounted to a quota, and that though “our institutions of higher 
education should reflect our diversity… quota systems that use race to include or exclude people 
from higher education and the opportunities it offers are divisive, unfair and impossible to square 
with the Constitution” (White House Press Release, 2003).  The Supreme Court’s eventual ruling 
on this case provided limited support for race-sighted affirmative action policies, determining 
that the point-based system was illegal, but that race-sighted admissions polices were acceptable 
if correctly applied.   
Despite the public debate, the effects of affirmative action policies on student quality and 
diversity are largely unknown.  Chan and Eyster (2003) develop a model suggesting that 
eliminating race-sighted affirmative action policies reduces student quality and diversity.  This 
paper will test that model empirically in the context of policy shifts at public universities in 
California, Florida, Georgia, Texas and Washington.  Specifically, Texas, California, Florida, 
and Washington were barred from using race as a consideration for admissions in the late 1990s.  

                                                 
1 The achievement gap between disadvantaged minorities (Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans) and advantaged 
groups (Whites and Asians) is well documented.  In 2003, the average GPA of White (Asian) SAT-takers was 3.37 
(3.41), as compared to 2.95 for Blacks.  A similar gap appears in SAT scores; the average score of White test-takers 
was 1063, whereas Black test-takers had an average score of 857.  Hispanics and Native Americans also perform 
lower by these measures, though the gap between their qualifications and those of White applicants is slightly 
smaller (College Board News 2005).

Georgia and Michigan have had their affirmative action policies challenged in court over the past 
several years, culminating in a 2003 Supreme Court decision barring the University of Michigan 
from using race in a numerical formula for evaluating applicants.  Each of these states provides a 
“natural experiment” to assess the impact of affirmative action programs on the qualifications 
and diversity of enrolled students.   
 
This paper describes a model of admission decisions under both race-sighted and race-
blind affirmative action policies.  It then uses data on SAT scores and race of enrolled college 
freshman at public doctoral universities to analyze the effects of banning affirmative action in 
several states.  A difference-in-differences and a trend-break model are both applied in an effort 
to identify a relevant counterfactual for each state.  The empirical evidence provides limited 
support of the theoretical predictions that banning the consideration of race will decrease student 
diversity and quality, particularly at the nation’s most selective public universities.  Further 
research is necessary to draw definite confusions about these policies’ effects, but much of the 
observed data suggests support for the proposed theoretical models of Chan and Eyster (2003) 
and Fryer, Loury and Yuret (2004). 
II. Previous Research on Affirmative Action 
 
Previous work regarding the effects of affirmative action policies on college admissions 
has been mostly theoretical, due to the lack of detailed data available to address this question.  
Chan and Eyster (2003) develop a model of admissions decisions based on a university’s 
preferences for well-qualified applicants and diversity.  They conclude that banning colleges 
from explicitly considering race, while maintaining their preference for student diversity, will 
cause the quality of admitted students to decrease.  Fryer et al. (2004) further expand the model 
of admissions decisions by adding applicant competition with endogenous effort.  They conclude 
that a color-blind admissions policy will decrease student qualifications among both minority 
and majority applicants, thus further contributing to the inefficiencies of race-blind admissions 
policies.   
 
Empirical work on the subject has been very limited in its scope.  Analyses by Freyer et 
al. (2004) and Long (2004) rely on simulated admissions decisions based on actual student data 
to test theoretical models.  While this provides valuable empirical verification of theoretical 
results, it fails to test whether college admissions offices respond in the predicted manner to 
affirmative action policy changes in the real world.  Thomas (2004), and Card and Kreuger 

 

2

(2004) both analyze the impact of affirmative action policies on where students choose to apply 
to colleges.  While this is an important dimension of affirmative action policy, it does not fully 
answer the question of what the college-level policy effects will be on diversity and student 
quality.  Also, those papers only look at evidence from Texas and California.  This analysis will 
take the significant step of incorporating data from a wider number of states, as well as looking 
at the effects of an affirmative action ban on student quality.  
III. A Theoretical Model of Admissions Decisions 
 
To appreciate the empirical test I will explore later, it is important to understand the 
theoretical model of admissions decisions analyzed in this paper.  This model is developed in 
more detail in both Chan and Eyster (2003), and Fryer et al. (2004).  The Fryer model takes 
student effort to be endogenous, and is thus a richer model.  For the purposes of the empirical 
analysis that follows, this endogeneity consideration is not critical, and the following discussion 
is based largely on Chan and Eyster (2003).  Following Fryer et al., it is instructive to use the 
model to compare the following admissions policies: a race-blind “laissez-faire” policy (LF) 
where there is no preference for student diversity; a race-sighted, traditional, affirmative action 
policy (RS) where the admissions committee can explicitly consider race; and a race-blind 
affirmative action policy (RB) where the admissions committee prefers diversity but cannot 
explicitly make decisions dependent on race.2    
A. Terms and Assumptions 
 Consider a model where applicants belong to one of two racial groups, R є {W, N}, and 
 
( 1,0∈
)
 is the fraction belonging to group W.  Group W is the (white) advantaged majority 
λ
group, and group N is the (nonwhite) disadvantaged minority group. 3   There are many colleges at 
which the applicants could seek admission, and each college has a maximum acceptance rate 
( 1,0∈C
)
.  Each student’s academic qualification level is represented by a number t, with 
( tt
)
t
,∈
.  Academic quality is distributed according to the density function n(t) for nonwhite 
candidates and w(t) for white candidates.  Both functions are strictly positive over the 

                                                
 
2 Specifically, the model developed here parallels closely the model in Fryer et al. (2004), omitting the consideration 
of endogenous effort.  It is slightly simplified from the form Chan and Eyster (2003) present, which also takes effort 
as exogenous, but yields the same important results. 
3 To apply this model to the real world, consider Asians with Whites in the advantaged, majority group, since they 
have similar distributions of student qualification.  Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans usually comprise the 
disadvantaged minority.

B. Laissez-Faire 
 
Under a laissez-faire admissions policy, the committee will maximize student quality 
without any consideration of diversity.  The admissions rule a(t) is the probability a that a 
student with qualification t is admitted.  In a laissez-faire environment, the admissions rule will 
not depend on the student’s race.  Thus, the admissions office’s maximization problem is: 
twtat
t

∫

[)(

where A is the set of allowable admissions rules.  The solution to this problem is an admissions 
rule a*(t) = 1 if t ≥ t*, and a*(t) = 0 if t ≤ t*, and W(t*) + N(t*) = 1 – C.  This admissions rule is 
illustrated in Figure 1, with the shaded area representing admitted students.  The total shaded 
area equals C, and the threshold is t*, as marked.  Thus, the admissions office sets a single 
threshold, above which it admits all students and below which it rejects all students.  This rule 
does not depend on the student’s race.   
C. Race-Sighted Affirmative Action 
A race-sighted affirmative action policy allows the admissions committee to establish 
 
two separate rules for minority and majority applicants.  An admissions committee with the goal 
                                                 
4 To see a model that makes student effort endogenous, cf. Fryer et al. (2004).  Recent work by Thomas (2004), and 
Card and Kreuger (2004), explores the assumption made here that affirmative action policies do not affect the 
schools students choose to apply to.  Card and Kreuger find no change in the proportion of highly-qualified black 
and Hispanic students applying to selective state universities in Texas and California after the elimination of race-
sighted affirmative action.

of diversity prefers the racial makeup of their student body to be close to the racial makeup of the 
overall candidate population.  The committee also maintains a preference for students with high 
academic qualifications.  Specifically, given its beliefs about the distributions of student 
qualification by race, n(t) and w(t), the admissions committee can target a specific acceptance 
Nr

rate,
, for the minority applicants.  This acceptance rate 
 is greater than 
, the acceptance

rate implied by a laissez-faire policy, but no greater than C, the rate required to achieve 
population parity.  The extent to which an admissions office prefers diversity, and hence the

C. Race-Blind Affirmative Action 
Under a race-blind regime, the admissions office once again targets a specific admissions

The solution can be characterized by the following property: for almost every t,

 (Fryer et al. 2004).  An example of a potential optimal RB solution is illustrated in 
0
Figure 3, with the shaded area representing admitted students.   
The theoretical model in the RB regime provides a strong theoretical prediction which I 
will test empirically in a later section.  Relative to a RS regime, a RB policy will have one of the 
following results: (a) a lower average level of student qualification if diversity level is held 
constant; (b) a lower level of diversity if student qualification is held constant; or (c) somewhat 
lower levels of both diversity and student qualification.  The race-blind policy is inefficient 
because it fails to admit some better-qualified students in exchange for admitting lesser-qualified 
students of the same race.  Thus, the school would be strictly better off it could substitute the 
lesser-qualified students with a better-qualified student from the same racial group.  By 
instituting a threshold policy as in the race-sighted regime, the admissions office could admit 
higher quality students given the same level of diversity.   
 
The solution form described above, which will reject some better-qualified student with a 
probability of one, while accepting a worse-qualified student, is considered implausible by Chan 
and Eyster (2003).  They restrict the admissions rule to be weakly increasing in the student’s 
qualification, t.  Solving the optimization problem with this monotonicity constraint, we would 
find that the college’s optimal acceptance policy is a step function with at most two points of 
                                                 
5 For more details on the process of solving this system see Fryer et al. (2004).

discontinuity.  This modification does not affect our previous conclusion that the optimal policy 
is not a threshold policy, and that for some t < s, a*(t) > 0 and a*(s) < 1.  In other words, the 
admissions office uses a random rule to accept students over some range of qualification levels.  
The above conclusion that a RS rule could achieve a higher level of student qualification for a 
given level of diversity is unchanged.  Furthermore, the monotonicity constraint provides us with 
another important conclusion that I will test empirically: the range of academic qualifications 
admitted under a RB policy will be greater than the range under a RS regime.  Thus, the 
theoretical framework provides two important, testable hypotheses for the proceeding empirical 
study. 
III. Data and History 

A. State Affirmative Action Histories 
 
This paper exploits changes in affirmative action policies in several states, both due to 
court rulings and state legislation.  A summary of the legal action in each study state follows: 
California: The University of California Board of Regents adopted a resolution in July 1995 
eliminating the consideration of race in admissions decisions.  Though the Regents eventually 
rescinded this resolution in May 2001, California voters had already amended the state 
constitution to ban RS policies with Proposition 209 (UCLA).  Proposition 209 was passed on 
November 5, 1996, prohibiting discrimination and preferential treatment based on “race, sex, 
color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or 
public contracting” (State of California Constitution).  This policy first affected the freshman 
class entering in 1998 (UCLA).  California further amended its admissions policies in March, 
1999, with a provision that all students in the top 4 percent of their graduating class would be 
guaranteed admission to one of California’s state universities. This policy first affected the class 
entering in Fall 2002 (Olsen 2003).   
Florida: Governor Jeb Bush and the state Cabinet elected to end race-sighted admissions 
policies in February, 2000.  The state immediately replaced RS affirmative action with the “One 
Florida” plan, which guarantees a place at one of Florida’s 10 state universities to any student 
graduating in the top 20 percent of his high school class who has completed a college preparatory 
curriculum.  This policy went into effect for the undergraduate class entering in Fall 2000 (Olsen 
2003). 

 

7

Georgia: In August 2001, the US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled that University of 
Georgia’s point-based policy using race as a consideration for admission was unconstitutional.  
This resulted in a ban on using race as a factor in admissions decisions and the elimination of 
race-based scholarships at Georgia’s state universities.  The decision first affected the class of 
2002.  11th Circuit Court decisions are also binding in Florida and Alabama, but because Florida 
already had a ban on race-sighted practices and Alabama was under court orders to desegregate, 
neither state was affected by the ruling (Christian Science Monitor). 
Texas: A lawsuit brought against the University of Texas Law School resulted in the elimination 
of race as a consideration for admissions in 1996, after a decision by the US Court of Appeals in 
the 5th Circuit.  5th Circuit decisions also affect Mississippi and Louisiana, but both states were 
under court orders to desegregate, so the impact was limited.  Effective Fall 1998, Texas adopted 
the 10% plan, which guarantees admission to students graduating in the top 10% of their high 
school class at any public university campus of their choice (Card and Kreuger 2004). 
Washington: In 1998, Washington voters followed California’s lead and passed Proposition 
200, which banned race-sighted admissions policies at state universities.  This law went into 
immediate effect, and the first class admitted under this policy enrolled in Fall 1999 (Western 
Washington University). 

B. Data Description 
 
I used data from the US News and World Report’s annual college guide, as well as the 
National Center for Education Statistics’ Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System 
(IPEDS).  From these two sources, available data has been collected on all public doctoral 
universities between 1992 and 2002.  Specifically, the number of enrolled, first-time, full-time 
freshman in each race category (Caucasian, Asian, Hispanic, Black, Non-resident alien and 
other) is recorded for each college-year.  Data on the average SAT/ACT scores, and the 25th-75th 
percentile scores was also collected.  For the years 1994-2002, the average score is not available 
so it is estimated by a linear interpolation of the 50th percentile from the 25th and 75th.  Also, all 
ACT scores were converted to their SAT equivalents, and all SAT scores reported between 1992 
and 1995 were recentered to be comparable to scores reported after that period.6   The overall 
acceptance rate was also tracked.  Unfortunately, the IPEDS database does not have any 
                                                 
6 The College Board recentered the SAT test in April 1995, and US News and World Report reports recentered 
scores beginning with its September 1996 issue.  The equivalency tables for the ACT/SAT conversion and the SAT 
recentering were provided by the College Board. 

 

8

observations from 1999, so all race/sex variables for that year are linearly interpolated from the 
1998 and 2000 values. 
 
Ideally, a more complete data set would include admissions data sorted by race, so that 
the academic qualifications and admissions rate could be tracked separately for students from 
each racial category.  Also, it would be desirable to track academic qualifications of applied, 
admitted and enrolled students, instead of just enrolled students.  Unfortunately, this data is 
proprietary and not available publicly.  This imposes a major limitation on the analysis.  
However, the available data still allows us to see the effects of affirmative action bans on the 
academic qualifications and diversity of enrolled students.  If we assume that these 
characteristics are a reasonable proxy for the qualifications and diversity of admitted students, 
then available data should be sufficient to test the key predictions of the empirical model 
presented earlier.  Also, given the natural experiment set-up, there is an obvious limitation on the 
number and quality of “treatment” group schools which experienced a change in the legality of 
affirmative action.  This could cause a problem of large standard errors in regression results, 
hindering causal inference.   
 
Descriptive statistics are reported in Table I separately for each of the states that are 
eventually RB and all other states in the years 1992-1996, before any change in affirmative 
action policy.  Georgia universities had both the highest average SAT scores (1182) and the 
highest average acceptance rate.   RS states had the lowest average SAT scores (1080).  
Washington had the largest range of SAT scores (the 75th minus the 25th percentile scores) at 230 
points, but all the groups are relatively closely clustered around 200.  Texas had the highest 
percent of underrepresented minorities at 36.4%, although the largest proportion of blacks was at 
Georgia colleges (15.7%).  There is a considerable amount of variation in the representation of 
Asians and Caucasians, with the fraction of whites ranging from 41 to 83 per cent.   
 
Figures 4-6 illustrate time trends of the outcome variables at three schools of interest: 
University of California at Berkeley, University of Texas at Austin, and University of 
Washington at Seattle.  Normalized year is defined so that zero is the first year of a policy 
change.  Minority representation drops substantially at UC Berkeley and UT Austin in the first 
year of the policy.  After that, the values gradually trend upwards as the admissions office adjusts 
to the new policy and percentage plans are implemented in both states.  There is not as strong a 
pattern in SAT averages or score range.  Average SAT scores actually increase slightly in the 

 

9

first year of the policy at UC Berkeley and Washington, though the change is small.  It is even 
harder to discern a pattern in score range, since the values fluctuate quite a bit from year to year.  
Because the amount of data used to produce these graphs is small, there is a significant amount 
of noise, making it difficult to see trends in student quality.  The regression analysis that follows 
allows the data to be pooled, making it easier to detect trends.   
 IV. Econometric Models 

A. Fixed Effects Model 
The analysis will use a differences-in-differences framework to analyze the impact of 
 
banning the use of race in college admissions.  Treatment schools will be grouped by state and 
analyzed separately.  All analyzed colleges are selected from the universe of public, doctoral 
universities (both extensive and intensive), as classified by the Carnegie Foundation.  The first 
set of regressions employs data on each state’s flagship university, here defined as the most 
selective college, i.e. the one with the highest average SAT scores over the analyzed period.  
These schools should experience the greatest impact of a ban on race-sighted admissions 
policies, since they have the most restrictive admissions rules.  The second set of regressions 
expands the analysis to include all “selective” universities, defined as schools with an average 
admissions rate of less than 80% over the entire sample period.  The last regressions include data 
from all public, doctoral universities in the state.  It is possible that a RB policy would not have a 
great impact on less selective colleges, since those schools frequently admit all students who 
meet some minimum threshold requirement of successful completion of a college preparatory 
curriculum.  Hence, the first two sets of regressions on flagship and selective universities may 
reveal a stronger effect of the RB policies.   
A major challenge of this analysis is the lack of a clear counterfactual; we cannot directly 
observe what would have happened in each of the treatment states had they retained race-sighted 
admissions policies.  The validity of any causal inference based on a fixed-effects regression 
depends on the identification of a control group which experiences the same time trend as the 
treatment group.  I employ two different strategies to identify control states, and each of them 
can contribute to our understanding of the policy’s overall effect.  The first approach, reported in 
Panel A of Tables 2, 3, and 4, uses all states which maintained race-sighted admissions policies 
as the control group; states that were under court order to desegregate their post-secondary 
school system were omitted from the controls, because the admissions dynamics in these states

selectivit

may have differed significantly from the treatment states and other controls as a result of the 
desegregation policy.   
The second approach uses propensity-score matching to identify the most appropriate 
control state.  This strategy can eliminate the bias due to imbalances in observed covariates, thus 
reducing the selection bias in the fixed effects regressions (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1984).  The 
propensity score model takes the form: 
(4) 
 
reform
race
pcts
_

+
γ
ε
s
i
j
ts

ts
,
,
,
The subscript s indexes each school; t indexes time.  Reform is a dummy variable that equals one 
for a college that eventually implements a race-blind affirmative action policy.  The race_pcts 
are a full set of variables indicating the fraction of students from each racial category.  
Selectivity_vars are a set of variables indicating the school’s selectivity: average SAT score, 
admissions rate, and the SAT score range.  Data from the pre-period (before any change in 
affirmative action policy) is pooled and collapsed to include only the mean values of the 
variables listed above for each state.  Parameters estimated from the regression are used to 
construct predicted values of reform for each state.  A control state is then selected based on the 
“nearest neighbor” rule, which chooses the state with the predicted value of reform which is 
closest to that of the treatment state.  A further restriction is imposed that the nearest neighbor 
control must be within ±0.2 of the treatment state’s predicted value to ensure a relevant match.  
The propensity-matching regression is run on three different samples, one for each set of 
analyzed schools: flagship, selective, and all state universities. 
 
After identifying appropriate control states, I run a series of difference-in-differences 
regressions to identify the effects of reforms on (a) fraction of under-represented minority 
students enrolled, (b) average/midpoint SAT scores, and (c) range of SAT scores in admitted 
class (i.e. the 75th percentile score minus the 25th percentile score).  Under-represented minorities 
are defined as Black, Hispanic and Native American. The last two sets of regressions rest on the 
assumption that SAT scores are a good proxy for the overall level of student qualification.  
While SAT scores do not give us a complete picture of the applicant profile available to an 
admissions committee (which also includes letters of recommendation, high school grades, extra-
curricular activities, awards and honors, etc.), it does provide a reasonable, albeit noisy, estimate 
of an applicant’s qualification level.  These three regressions will take the following form:

The outcome variable is one of the three variables listed above (minority enrolment, average 
SAT, SAT range).  The independent variable raceblind is a dummy variable for whether a race-
blind policy was in effect.  The regression includes a full set of year fixed effects (year), state 
fixed effects (state), and a control for the overall admissions rate (admit).  Also, each college-
level observation is weighted by the total enrollment at that university.  This regression can be 
given a causal interpretation as long as the control states provide a relevant counterfactual, and 
no other factors correlated both with being in the treatment group and with the outcome variable 
changed in the year of the reform.   
Unfortunately, the exclusion restriction may not be completely valid, since there is 
evidence that schools changed their recruiting behavior after the imposition of race-blind 
admissions.  For example, the University of Georgia (UGA) placed new recruitment officers in 
regions of the state with high minority populations after the affirmative action ban.  In 2003, 
UGA also purchased a database of 12,000 minority high school sophomores and juniors with a 
GPA of at least 3.3 (CNN 2003).  As a result of focusing larger recruiting efforts on minority 
students, the applicant pool may have changed significantly at UGA and other treatment schools.  
This would cause us an upward bias of the parameter β in regressions on minority enrolment.  
The direction of the bias in regressions on average SAT scores is also likely to be upward, and in 
regressions on the range of SAT scores, bias should be downward.  If the applicant pool changes 
so there are more minority applicants, holding majority applicants and the distribution of test 
scores constant, then the admissions office can admit the same number of minorities as before 
while increasing the admissions standards.  
B. Trend-Break Model 
A trend-break model is also employed to test whether the time trend for a specific 
treatment state changes after the ban on race-sighted affirmative action.  The regressions take the 
following form:

The outcome variables are the same as in the fixed effects model (percentage minority, SAT 
score, and SAT range). The trending variable time equals zero in 1992 and counts up.  The 
coefficient γt gives the impact of a RB regime on the time trend.  This regression will allow 
causal inference provided that there is no omitted factor correlated with both the outcome 
variable and the introduction of a race-blind policy.  The model is analyzed separately for each

of the three groups of schools (flagship, selective, and all state colleges) as before.  
Unfortunately, causal inference based on this model is vulnerable to the same source of bias 
described above, resulting from changes in recruiting practices.   
V. Results 
 
Table 2 reports regression results on a sample of flagship campuses, based on the fixed 
effects model with all control states (Panel A), the fixed effects model with a propensity-matched 
control (Panel B), and the trend-break model (Panel C).  RB affirmative action policies caused a 
decline in minority enrollment in all states except Florida, when measured by the fixed effects 
model in panel A.  This decline was statistically significant in California and Georgia, where the 
estimated drop in minority enrollment was as much as 7.6 percentage points.  In most states, 
negative impact on minority representation surfaces in the propensity-matched fixed effects and 
trend break models as well.  Florida saw a small increase in the percentage minority students 
enrolled, perhaps because of the implementation of their 20% “One Florida” plan, which 
coincided with the ban on race-sighted admissions.  The average SAT score also declined in 
almost every state, in each estimated regression.  The magnitude of the decline ranged between 
20 and 60 points.  Overall, this evidence supports the first implications of the theoretical model 
presented earlier.  The implementation of a race-blind admissions policy is associated with a 
decline in minority enrollment and average SAT scores at most schools.  The analysis of the 
SAT score range does not reveal as clear a picture.  While some states saw the range rise, others 
saw a statistically significant decline, contrary to the theoretical prediction.  It is possible that not 
all universities preferred an admissions rule that was weakly increasing in student quality, in 
which case the theoretical model does not predict that SAT range would increase.  Alternatively, 
the 75th-25th percentile score may not provide a good measure of how admissions behavior 
changed.  For example, it is possible that schools only adjusted enrollment policies for the lower 
quartile of their admitted class, in which case this measure would not reflect the policy’s full 
impact. 
 
Expanding the sample to all selective universities in Table 3 suggests some further, 
though weaker, support of the theoretical model.  The effect of RB affirmative action on 
minority enrollment is no longer clear, as Florida and Texas show some evidence of a positive 
relationship.  The positive correlation can probably be explained by the states’ percentage plans, 
which tend to increase minority enrollment because of school segregation at the high school 

 

13

level.  The effect of RB policies on the average SAT score is also not obvious; all states except 
Georgia show a decline in their average SAT scores, but this decline is only statistically 
significant in Florida at conventional levels.  It is interesting to note that any state showing an 
increase in minority enrollment experienced a decrease in average SAT scores; in addition, 
Georgia’s 55 point increase in average SAT scores was associated with a modest decrease in 
minority enrollment by about one or two percentage points.  This is suggestive of the theory that 
the admissions offices make some tradeoff between diversity and student quality, and perhaps 
this evidence is illustrating how different universities prioritize these two goals.  These 
regressions do not further clarify the effect of RB policies on SAT range, and these numbers 
continue to vary in sign and magnitude across states. 
 
The last set of regressions on the entire universe of public, doctoral universities is 
reported in Table 4, and the results are similar to those in Table 3.  Florida’s minority enrollment 
increased by about 2 percentage points and their average SAT score dropped by 45 points, as 
estimated in panel A, with both results significantly different from zero at the 5% confidence 
level.  Georgia, California and Washington experienced small declines in their minority 
enrollments, results which were statistically significant in Georgia (panel A) and Washington 
(Panel C).  Several states report a significant decline in SAT range, contrary to the predictions of 
the theoretical model presented earlier. 
 
Taken together, these tables provide some support for the theory that a ban on race-
sighted affirmative action would be associated with a decline in minority representation and 
student quality at the most selective campuses.  In general, schools seem to be forced to make 
some tradeoff between maintaining their diversity and maintaining student quality after the 
imposition of a RB regime.  The results do not provide support for the prediction that a RB 
policy will cause an increase in the range of SAT scores among freshmen.  Without more 
detailed data, it is impossible to make conclusive statements about the precise effects of banning 
the consideration of race in admissions decisions; however, taken together, the theoretical and 
empirical evidence suggest that there could be serious inefficiencies associated with imposing a 
race-blind policy. 
 
A major limitation of this analysis is its inability to analyze the effects of affirmative 
action policy on the makeup of the applicant pool and the demographics of admitted (rather than 
enrolled) students.  It is possible that RB policies will discourage minority applicants to 

 

14

prestigious universities, causing a decline in minority representation for reasons other than the 
university’s changing optimal admissions rule modeled earlier.  The impact on the applicant pool 
has been explored by Card and Kreuger (2004) and Thomas (2004) as discussed above; however, 
more research needs to be done in states beyond Texas and California to validate these results.  
Also, if a race-blind policy discourages accepted minorities from attending because they perceive 
a less hospitable environment, minority enrollment could be further reduced.  Lastly, the 
empirical data employed in this study did not allow an analysis of student effort.  As described 
by Fryer et al. (2004), students may realize that academic quality is not consistently rewarded 
under a RB regime, thus decreasing their incentive to exert high effort.  In equilibrium, both 
minority and majority students may choose to exert less effort, and the achievement gap between 
the groups may also wide.  The decline in student effort is a further inefficiency resulting from 
the race-blind policy.  An empirical study of student effort could test the predictions of Fryer et 
al., though it would be difficult to find consistently-measured, long-term data on effort or 
academic quality.  There is also potential for future research on the impact of affirmative action 
policies on the applicant pool and admitted students, should more detailed data become 
available.   
VI. Conclusion  
 
The theoretical model and empirical evidence presented in this paper suggest that there 
may be significant inefficiencies associated with a ban on race-sighted admissions.  The theory 
predicts that as long as universities retain a preference for diversity, preventing them from 
considering race could decrease student quality and/or minority representation, while failing to 
strongly reward student effort.  The empirical analysis provides some limited support for the 
theoretical model, particularly as it bears upon highly selective institutions.  The flagship 
universities of Florida, Georgia and Washington showed statistically significant decreases in 
average SAT scores after a RB policy was in place.  Minority enrollment also decreased 
significantly at California, Florida and Georgia’s flagship campuses.  When weighing race-blind 
policies, states should consider that the associated decreases in student quality and diversity 
could put them at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis private universities who can continue to 
use race in admissions decisions.  This body of research on race-blind admissions could bring 
significant insight to the national debate on the role of affirmative action, since the public 
discourse frequently fails to differentiate between laissez-faire admissions and race-blind 

 

15

affirmative action.  If states simply switched from a race-sighted to a laissez-faire policy after a 
legal ban on the consideration of race, then the theoretical model predicts that average SAT 
scores would increase.  Empirical evidence to the contrary suggests that states retain a preference 
for diversity even when they cannot directly consider race.  In sum, public decisions restricting 
the consideration of race in admissions could have a serious negative impact on our national 
university system, reducing schools’ ability recruit and admit the best-qualified students and 
impairing their ability to achieve racial diversity.
