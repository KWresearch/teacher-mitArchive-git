MINORITIES AND THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE: 
DISCRIMINATION AND NETWORK EFFECTS 

Sameer Riaz 
May 11, 2005 

Introduction and Motivation 

Throughout history, discrimination has occurred against minorities.  From the poor 

treatment of the Native Americans by the colonists to the interment of Japanese-Americans 

during World War II, ethnic preconceptions and stereotypes cause animosity towards minority 

ethnic groups.  By studying the membership records of the New York Stock Exchange from 

1883 to 1974, a period during which a large number of immigrants came to the shores of the 

United States, I seek to answer the question of whether minorities were discriminated against 

while trying to become members of the Stock Exchange, as such discrimination would provide 

barriers to entry to the world of finance, as membership is required for trading securities, a vital 

practice for any large financial institution or brokerage.  I also look for evidence of network 

effects through transfers of seats, that could potentially be used to circumvent discrimination. 

Jacob Riis’ seminal book, How the Other Half Lives, captured the attitudes towards 

minorities during the early twentieth century, a period this study covers.  Remarking on various 

ethnicities, Riis noted, “the Italian and the poor Jew rise only by compulsion… The Irishman’s 

genius runs to public affairs rather than domestic life; wherever he is mustered in force the 

saloon is the gorgeous center of political activity.  The German struggles vainly to learn his trick; 
his Teutonic wit is too heavy.”1  The popularity of Riis’ novel and the attitudes displayed within 

show what was thought of minorities of New York during the late nineteenth and early twentieth 

century.  Studying the New York Stock Exchange data provides a unique test of discrimination 

to see whether such attitudes towards minorities permeated the New York Stock Exchange. 

Using the New York Stock Exchange data over a period of 91 years can also show the 

change in the treatment of ethnic groups over time.  Membership in the New York Stock 

Exchange is a necessary position in the world of finance, as membership entails “access to the 
NYSE… (i.e., only members are actually allowed to trade securities on the exchange floor).”2 

The responsibilities of a trader include buying and selling securities on behalf of clients, or for 

the trader’s own company.  Large financial institutions and brokerage houses become members 

of the Stock Exchange so that they can execute client orders without having to go through a 

middle man, who would presumably charge a fee for his services.  The right to trade is the most 

important motivation behind becoming a member of the Stock Exchange.  The number of seats is 

constant at 1,366 and has been since 1953.  A major expansion of seats occurred in 1929, when

all existing member were given quarter seat dividends, effectively increasing the number of seats 

from 1,100 to 1,375.  There is an open market in the sale of seats, as they are classified as 
“personal salable property.”3  However, an attempt to become a member still requires that a 

certain set of membership criteria be met, including sponsorship by two current members, no 

history of felonies or violations of securities law, and, as the New York Stock Exchange notes, 
“high standards of personal and financial integrity.”4  The Committee on Admissions reviews 

each application, and can choose to reject it, if the prospective member does not match the 

committee’s standards of “integrity.”  Testing the effect of ethnicity on the membership of the 

New York Stock Exchange acts as a barometer towards the penetration of ethnic groups into 

commercial and financial sectors, as any firm would need membership to execute trades and 

attract clients.  Negative discrimination would essentially act as a barrier to entry to the financial 

sector for minorities, creating exclusivity and limiting the number of minorities.  Also, due to the 

component of application review by the Committee on Admissions during the membership 

process, using the New York Stock Exchange data may help reflect larger societal attitudes 

towards ethnicities. 

I find three main results related to my hypothesis on discrimination and network effects. 

During the rise of the Nazi party in Germany and World War II, Jewish buyers pay less, on 

average, than other ethnicities.  During World War I, German buyers are much more likely to 

have potential transactions rejected by the Committee on Admissions, while Jewish buyers are 

more likely to be rejected by the Committee of Admissions while attempting to buy a seat.  Also, 

German and Jewish buyers are much more likely to have intra-ethnic nominal transactions, or 

transfers of seats.  These results suggest taste-based discrimination in the Stock Exchange until 

the end of World War II.  Exogenous events such as World War I and World War II, which have 

no effect on the trading ability of German members, cause shifts in preferences as can be 

evidenced by price differentials and the increased likelihood of rejection.  In the case of the first 

World War, buyers of German origin, a war enemy of the United States, are much more likely to 

be rejected; while in the case of the rise of the Nazi party and the persecution of Jewish people, 

Jewish buyers pay, on average, 5% less for seats, showing that the events leading up to World 

War II are associated with a shift in preferences in favor of Jewish buyers. Also, the analysis of 

nominal transactions leads to the conclusion that there are strong network effects between certain

minorities, indicating that this may be a way to circumvent any existing discrimination.  These 

three results show that the Stock Exchange reflected societal attitudes towards ethnicities, with 

certain ethnicities suffering more due to pervasive preconceptions. 

Previous Literature 

There has been an enormous amount of discussion regarding discrimination in economic 

literature.  Becker (1957) introduces a preference based model of discrimination, in which 

preferences regarding race or gender enter into utility functions of employers in the scenario of a 

labor market, for example.  Discrimination is associated with tastes, and if there were enough 

non-discriminating employers discrimination would disappear.  Most economic studies, 

however, focus on a model of statistical discrimination, developed by Phelps (1972) and Arrow 

(1973).  This model is based on the differential reliability of ability and performance indicators 

among separate groups, causing discrimination through the quality of indicators, rather than 

through utility preferences.  Race and gender can be used as these indicators, as Aigner and Cain 

(1977) note, using the specific example of race, “In light of known premarket discrimination 
against blacks, the assumption by employers of unequal average abilities is realistic.”5  In this 

example, preconceived notions about certain ethnicities are used by employers as evidence of 

ability.  Recent work on discrimination has included Bertrand and Mullainathan (2004), which 

used an experimental design to test discrimination in the labor market.  Assigning ethnic-

sounding names to resumes, Bertrand and Mullainathan found that African-American names 

received fewer call-backs for employment positions, implying different treatment by race.  A 

recent study by Levitt (2003) on discrimination in the television show The Weakest Link, shows 

evidence of statistical discrimination against Hispanic competitors because of perceptions of 

lower ability, as well as preference based discrimination against elder contestants.  Levitt 

analyzed the voting practices of competitors who voted each other off at the end of each 

competition, and found no evidence of discrimination against women and African-Americans. 

Considering that all the competitors have comparable ability, the evidence of discrimination 

against Hispanic competitors is surprising. 

Analysis of the New York Stock Exchange seat prices has been mainly done through the 

view of the seat as a capital asset which reflects sentiments regarding future expectations of the

Relations Review, January 1977, 30(1), pg. 185

market.  Keim and Madhavan (2000) find that increased trading in seats is associated with lower 

volatility of the S&P 500 index.  Davis, Neal, and White (2003) analyze the effect of the quarter 

dividend of 1929 on seat prices.  The quarter dividend was a one time dividend that gave all 

members an extra quarter of a seat in an effort to increase the membership seats on the stock 

exchange, as demand was high after the economic boom of the 1920’s.  Employing a generalized 

autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model, Davis, Neal and White find that monthly 

volume and the level of the Dow Jones Industrial Average determine significant components of 

seat prices.  They also note that the quarter dividend increased the value of the New York Stock 

Exchange in expectation of increased efficiency, as well as the opportunity by members to make 

personal gains off sales. 

This paper examines another component of seat prices other than their predictive power 

or the effect of volume traded on the stock exchange.  Using fixed effects estimators, I wish to 

determine the relationship between stock prices and ethnicities, taking on a completely different 

approach than previous work done.  The role of this research is also different – while previous 

work on seat prices has attempted to answer the relationship between seat prices and market 

sentiment – this research wishes to answer whether seat prices acted as barriers to entry into the 

financial world for minorities.  This analysis combines work on discrimination and seat prices, 

answering questions separate from the ones that Keim and Mudhavan & Davis, Neal, and White 

attempted to answer. 

Theoretical Model 

Two types of models deal with discrimination: models of taste-based discrimination, in 

which certain groups are preferred over other ones, such as those developed by Becker (1957); 

and a model of statistical discrimination, in which differential indicators of ability drive 

discrimination, such as the one developed by Aigner and Cain (1977).  In the context of the New 

York Stock Exchange, the taste-based model of discrimination seems a more natural method of 

approaching the problem, because attitudes towards certain groups and their presence on the 

exchange would be best ascertained by the preferences and views of existing members.  There 

are no strict prerequisites or tests of ability required for successful membership in the Exchange, 

making the model of statistical discrimination not as relevant in this case.  Taste-based 

discrimination can be tested through the existence of price differentials, as the less preferred 

4


group would have to pay a higher price, or in a labor market scenario, the less preferred group 

would be paid a lower wage.  The higher price (or lower wage) arises from the fact that less 

preferred groups must compensate for the loss in utility by an employer. 

One criticism of the taste-based model of discrimination is the fact that discrimination 

can be competed away by non-discriminating agents, especially in competitive markets, 

sometimes making it hard to quantify the discrimination.  However, in the case of the New York 

Stock Exchange, there is only one firm to consider, and the Committee on Admissions can 

choose to reject an application during review for any reason. 

Data Description 

The data set comes from the New York Stock Exchange and records buyer and seller 

transactions from 1883 to 1974.  The data set contains buyer and seller names, the date of the 

transaction, the price paid, the type of transaction, and the outcome.  There can be two types of 

transactions: a regular transaction or a nominal transaction, where a seat is transferred to the 

potential member for a nominal price.  This usually occurs between families or as a result of the 

execution of wills and can include intra-firm transfers of a seat.  There are also two outcomes: 

the Committee on Admissions can either accept or reject the transaction.  All the prices are 
normalized to year 2000 prices obtained using a GDP deflator.6  As an example, $1 from 1930 

would be worth $8.67 in 2000.  This is a time series data set, with observations across weeks. 

The Committee on Admissions only used to meet once a week, and so the date of the transaction 

is noted as this date. 

The buyer and seller names were matched to ethnicities using a process by List Service 

Direct, Inc. (LSDI), a marketing company that specializes in matching names to specific 

ethnicities, using a variety of factors.  Out of 9750 transactions, 85.5% of the buyer names were 

matched by LSDI, while 85.2% of the seller names were matched.  The ethnic coding system 

used by LSDI combines the use of unique first names with a dictionary of ethnic last name.  The 

unique first names imply that each name has a distinct ethnicity associated with it.  Beyond that, 

LSDI uses linguistic and geocentric rules, as well as specific suffix and prefix rules to find the 

ethnicity and religious identity of a name.  If a first name, such as Anthony, can belong to more 

than one ethnicity, then LSDI uses the last name as well as the linguistic rules of prefixes and 

6

5 

suffixes to find the specific ethnicity of the name, instead of relying on a first name that could 

belong to numerous ethnicities.  For example, Italian origin surnames ending in “Dda” or “Ddo” 

would mean a person is originally from Sardinia.  These Sardinian surnames then would easily 
be categorized as Italian.  Such rules make it easier to match names to ethnicities.7 

The main advantage that arises from using unique first names, as well as linguistic rules, 

is that each name can only have one ethnicity match.  However, various biases may arise. 

Firstly, LSDI uses current census data to find out the proportion of certain ethnicities in a given 

location.  This would be a problem in historical data sets, as current census data would be 

applied in the coding system.  However, since the data set given to the company did not specify a 

location, this is not a factor to worry about.  Secondly, LSDI mainly provides services to 

marketing companies that wish to make use of ethnic and religious data to provide targeted 

services and ads to consumers.  Because of its role as a service provider to marketing companies, 

LSDI may focus more on implied income differences due to ethnicity, and thus may have more 

accurate estimates for groups of ethnicities that have higher wages, rather than focusing on a 

specific ethnic group, creating measurement error.  The third source of bias can be the fact that 
immigrants may change their last names to assimilate and integrate into society better.8  This 

would obviously cause us to underestimate the number of minorities in the data, since they 

would give up their ethnically identifying names in favor of more common names that favored 

assimilation into society. 

Table 1 presents the summary statistics for the data set.  The statistics are grouped into 

the time periods of interest: 1883-1913, 1914-1918, 1919-1929, 1929-1933, 1933-1945, and 

1946-1974.  The final column presents statistics for the combined period covering the data set, 

1883-1974.  The percentages of buyer ethnicities are presented, as well as the minimum, mean, 

and maximum price paid for a seat during each period.  The bottom rows present the number and 

percentage shares of nominal and rejected transactions, and the final row presents the average 

weekly S&P 500 returns. 

As can be seen from the table, the percentage of English buyers, the majority on the 

Exchange, declines over time, from a maximum of 49.79% in 1883-1914, to only 29.18% in 

1946-1974.  The ethnic composition of buyers is increasing over time, as is evident by the 

example of Irish buyers, who constitute only 5.42% of the buyers from 1883-1914, and 13.55%

from 1946-1974.  Similarly, Jewish buyers only constitute 9.24% of the sample in 1883-1913, 

but are 12.95% of the sample in 1946-1974. 

The middle rows give statistics on prices paid for seats.  Prices rose in value from 1883, 

when the highest price for a seat in nominal terms was $30,000, reaching a peak in the 1929(cid:173)

1933 period, which coincided with the quarter dividend.  In nominal terms, the highest price paid 

in this period was $625,000.  After the fall of prices during the Great Depression, prices began to 

rebound during the late 1960’s, reaching highs of $450,000 in 1967, as can be seen in Figure 2. 

The average real price for the whole data set was $1,231,231.  Currently, a seat sells for around 
$2,400,000.9 

The bottom rows give the statistics of nominal and rejected transactions.  Only 131 

transactions out of the sample of 9,750 were rejected, and 39% of these rejected transactions 

occur between 1883 and 1913.  On the other hand, there are 2,143 nominal transactions, with 

such transactions increasing over time.  This may occur as larger firms become members of the 

Stock Exchange, bringing about a need to have more intra-firm transfers of seats. 

The final row gives the average of the weekly S&P 500 returns for all the time periods. 

As we can see, the average returns are increasing over time, with the notable exception of World 

War I (1914-1918).  The average weekly returns for the whole sample are 0.433%. 

Econometric Models 

There are three analyses done in this paper to examine the effect of ethnicity on 

membership.  The first analysis examines the effect of ethnicity on the price of seats, while the 

last two analyses use logit probability models to examine the effect of ethnicity on the 

probability of being rejected or having a nominal transaction. 

Fixed Effects Model 

The first analysis examines the effect of ethnicity on prices.  The Committee on 

Admissions met once a week to review potential members, so we have a number of observations 

per week.  On average, there are 2.4 observations per week and the maximum number of 

observations is 60.  As this is a time-series data set, using OLS would cause problems with serial

correlation.  This is especially true because seat prices are related to the profitability of the 

market, and including weekly S&P 500 returns would cause serial correlation.  Using a fixed 

effects estimator would get rid of this issue, as any fixed effect across a week, such as the S&P 

500 returns, would be eliminated.  If we take: 

(1)  y  = α  + βX  + u it , t  = 2 
,1  ,..., T
it
i 
it 

(2)  y  = α  + βX  + u

where yit  signifies the log of seat price and Xit  is a set of covariates, and (2) is the average over 

time of (1), then subtracting (2) from (1) yields: 

(3)  y&&  = βX&&  + u&& 
it 
it
it 

where (3) is the fixed effects estimator across t.  In this case, t is 1 week, so (3) would be the 

weekly fixed effects estimator, with αi, the weekly fixed effect subtracted away.  One of the 

assumptions of the fixed effects estimator is that each variable in the vector Xit  changes over 

time.  As was noted earlier, this assumption is true because the ethnic composition of the buyers 

is changing over time.  From Table 1, we also see that other control variables, such as the S&P 

500 returns, are also changing over time. 

Logit Model 

The second and third approach employs logit regressions.  A logit regression is a binary 

response model that overcomes the limitations of the traditional linear probability model, in 

which the fitted results can be less than 0 or greater than 1.  A logit model takes the form: 

(4) P(z = 1 | X) = F(α+ βX) 

where z is the outcome, such as a transaction being rejected or being nominal, αis a fixed effect, 

and X  is a set of covariates.  F(x) is the logistic function: 

(5) 

x e 
1 + e x 
A fixed effects technique can be applied to (4), as is done by Freeman (1978) 10,  by taking the 

difference between time periods, which results in a multinomial model when there are more than 

10  See Freeman, Richard B. “A Fixed Effect Logit Model of the Impact of Unionism on Quits.” NBER Working 
Paper 280, for a more detailed explanation.

two time periods.  By using this fixed effects logit model, we can test the effect of ethnicity of 

probability of positive outcomes for both rejected and nominal transactions. 

The logit estimator gives us P(z = 1 | X), which is a conditional probability.  To find the 

joint probability of z and X occurring, we can use Bayes’ rule: 

(6) P(z | X) P(X) = P(z & X)


This would give us the true probability of being a rejected buyer of a certain ethnicity since we


remove the conditional statement.


Empirical Results 

Fixed Effects Results 

The first analysis consists of fixed effects estimates of the association between ethnicity 

and the log of seat price.  To test the change in the hypothesized discrimination, many event and 

ethnicity interactions are used, to test the effect of events such as the rise of the Nazi party in 

Germany or World War I on prices charged to buyers of German ethnicities.  These interactions 

allow us to test for the effect of exogenous events, such as the rise of the Nazi party (to continue 

the example), on discrimination, and whether these shocks caused a change in preferences 

regarding German buyers.  Table 2 presents the fixed effects estimates of ethnicity on the log of 

seat prices.  Column 1 only includes the ethnicity variables and an interaction variable, which is 

a Bernoulli variable with a positive outcome whenever a buyer is the same ethnicity as the seller. 

Column 2 includes ethnicities interacted with the Great Depression, the rise of the Nazi party 

interacted with German and Jewish buyers and dummy variables for World War I, from 1914 to 

1918, and World War II, from 1939 to 1945, interacted with buyers who have names originating 

from war enemy countries (Italy and Germany).  Column 3 includes a pre World War I dummy 

interacted with ethnicities.  Columns 4 and 5 mirror the regressions reported in columns 2 and 3, 

but include a dummy for the quarter dividend sales of 1929-1932 and ethnicity interactions rather 

than with the Great Depression.  The quarter dividend was given to members right before the 

Great Depression, and sales of quarter seats lasted through the early 1930’s, providing a positive 

relationship with the Great Depression variables.  There were 1,056 quarter dividend sales, and a 

total of 1,597 transactions during the years of the Great Depression.  Columns 2-6 also include 

ethnicity variables interacted with weekly S&P 500 returns.  This is included partly to control for 

9


the movement of seat prices with market returns, and also to see whether minorities were 

charged different prices when seats were more attractive. 

The ethnicity dummies have no significant results across the different models run, other 

than Dutch and Jewish buyers.  The Jewish buyer dummy is significant at 5% in columns 1 and 

5, and is about 1% in magnitude.  This means that on average, Jewish buyers paid around 1% 

less for seat prices.  If a seat was selling for $1,000,000, then Jewish buyers would pay $10,000 

less.  Dutch buyers also pay 1% less on average, as can be seen from column 6.  This result can 

be expected, as the Dutch are often recognized as being members of the New York elite, and it 

would not be surprising to see them receiving a discount.  The most robust result throughout all 

the specifications is the discount Jewish buyers receive during the period of Nazi rule in 

Germany (1933-1945).  On average, Jewish buyers pay 5% less, (or $50,000 less for a seat 

selling for $1,000,000) everything else held constant.  This is significant at a 5% level in 

columns 2-5, and at a 10% level in column 6.  In the framework of a taste based discrimination 

model, this price differential suggests that the effect of the Nazi persecution of Jewish people 

was a positive change in preferences towards Jewish buyers at the Stock Exchange.  The 

coefficient on the quarter dividend dummy significant and positive throughout, consistent with 

the result of Davis, Neal, and White (2005), who find that the quarter dividend increased prices 

of membership seats. 

The S&P 500 weekly returns and ethnic interactions are significant for German, Irish, 

and Jewish buyers.  However, the results do not have a large effect on price once we consider the 

average S&P 500 weekly returns, which were 0.433% for the whole data set.  If we take the S&P 

500 Weekly Return * Irish coefficient from column 2, then we see that the effect of multiplying 

the average return, 0.433%, by the coefficient, 0.41, would result in a price change of 0.18%, or 

a change of $1800 for a seat price of $1,000,000. 

Logit Results 

The analyses of nominal and rejected transactions require the use of a fixed effects logit 

estimator.  A rejected transaction can be viewed as a transaction with such a high price 

demanded that the buyer is unwilling to pay it.  Under taste-based discrimination, the probability 

of rejection would be high for members of ethnicities that are not preferred by existing members; 

this would be analogous to demanding an extremely high price to compensate for the disutility of 

10


having a member of this ethnicity on the Exchange.  The large concentration of rejected 

transactions during 1883-1913 may provide accurate estimates of discrimination during this 

period as any result would reflect the attitudes of the Committee on Admissions.  Table 3 

presents the estimates of the fixed effects logit regressions with rejected transactions as the 

binary outcome.  Column 1 presents the estimates of ethnicities and the buyer seller ethnicity 

interaction, while Column 2 adds the S&P 500 Weekly returns interacted with ethnicities, the 

Nazi party interactions, and the World War I interaction.  Column 3 adds the Great Depression 

interactions, and Column 4 adds the pre-World War I ethnicity interactions.  Due to the small 

size of the data set, a regression model including both Great Depression and the quarter dividend 

interactions could not be run. 

Columns 2 shows that German buyers are less likely to be rejected, with the estimate 

significant at a 10% level and the ceteris paribus estimate of rejection being with both estimates 

significant at a 10% level and the ceteris paribus estimate of the conditional probability of 

rejection being 20%.  Using Bayes’ rule, the probability of being a rejected German buyer is 

simply 20% multiplied by the proportion of German buyers in the sample, which is 10.6%.  This 

makes the probability 2.12%.  The World War I and German buyer interaction shows that 

German buyers were much more likely to be rejected during World War I, with a ceteris paribus 

estimate of the conditional probability of rejection being 95%, and the joint probability being 

11.3%.  This result is suggestive of taste-based discrimination, as the exogenous effect of World 

War I, which was not caused by, and should have no effect on the trading abilities of, German 

buyers, was an increase in the probability that such buyers were rejected by the Exchange.  In the 

framework of taste-based discrimination, this would suggest that preferences had presumably 

changed to discriminate against them.  Columns 1-4 also show that Jewish buyers were much 

more likely to be rejected.  In Column 3 the ceteris paribus estimate of the probability of being 

rejected being 83.75%, with the coefficient for this estimate significant at a 5% level.  The 

probability of being a rejected Jewish buyer is 7.5%.  This result is surprising since the 

regressions on price show that Jewish buyers receive a slight discount, while this analysis shows 

that Jewish buyers were much more likely to be rejected. 

Table 4 presents the logit regressions with nominal transactions as the dependent 

variable.  The nominal transaction can be viewed as more in the light of network effects that can 

be used to circumvent discrimination.  As network effects are now being measured, specific 

buyer and seller ethnicity interactions are included rather than the general interaction variable, to 

11


capture the existence of network effects.  Column 1 presents the estimates with the ethnicities 

and ethnicity buyer/seller matches, while Column 2 and 3 include the Great Depression 

interactions and pre-World War I interactions, respectively.  Columns 4 and 5 mirror the 

regressions in Columns 2 and 3, except with the quarter dividend dummy and interactions 

instead of the Great Depression interactions.  Columns 2-5 also include the interactions between 

the S&P 500 weekly returns and ethnicities. 

In Column 1, it can be seen that German and Jewish buyers are less likely to take part in 

nominal transactions, while Scottish buyers are more likely to.  The Jewish effect remains in 

columns 2, 4, and 5, and the Scottish effect remains in column 5.  The German and Jewish result 

could be explained by a mix of hypothesized discrimination, as well as the low number of these 

ethnicities in the Stock Exchange.  As there were not many members of these two ethnicities on 

the Stock Exchange, there may have been a limit on the number of nominal transactions they 

could participate on.  From columns 2-5, we can see that the buyer seller ethnicity match for both 

German and Jewish buyers is significant.  The German interaction is significant at 1% in 

columns 2-3, and at 5% in columns 4-5.  In column 3, the ceteris paribus estimate of the 

conditional probability of participating in a nominal transaction conditional on having a German 

seller and buyer is 77%, while the joint probability is 1.1%, as calculated from Bayes' rule.  The 

Jewish interaction is significant at 5% in columns 2-3, and at 10% in columns 4-5.  In column 3, 

the ceteris paribus estimate of the conditional probability of participating in a nominal 

transaction given that there is a Jewish buyer and seller is seller is 76%, and the joint probability 

is 0.8%.  This means that the probability of a German buyer and seller entering into a nominal 

transaction was 1.1% and for a Jewish buyer and seller it was 0.8%.  German buyers and sellers 

were also 77% more likely to enter into nominal transactions than other ethnicities, all else equal; 

Jewish buyers were 76% more likely to enter into nominal transactions than other ethnicities, all 

else equal.  Through these nominal transactions, Jewish and Irish buyers may have been able to 

circumvent discrimination through higher probabilities of rejection, or been able to build their 

presence in the Stock Exchange gradually, increasing their presence through nominal transfers. 

As expected, the quarter dummy has a negative effect on nominal transactions.  This is because 

the gains from sales were more attractive during this period because of artificially higher prices, 

increasing rents for members who chose to sell, especially in light of the future market crash and 

the subsequent decline in seat prices.

Conclusion 

Using the New York Stock Exchange transaction data from 1883-1974,  I estimate the 

effect of ethnicity on becoming a member of the New York Stock Exchange through three 

measures: seat prices charged, the number of rejected transactions, and the number of nominal 

transactions.  I find that any evidence of price discrimination occurs during periods of exogenous 

events, such as World War I and World War II, and there seems to be no evidence of systematic 

discrimination with regards to price differentials.  However, the pool of rejected observations 

shows evidence of discrimination towards Jewish buyers and German buyers during World War 

I.  This result is the most suggestive of taste based discrimination, as it shows that the Committee 

on Admissions, the review board of the Stock Exchange, had a significantly higher probability of 

rejecting Jewish and German buyers.  I also find that during the rise of the Nazi party in 

Germany and World War II, Jewish buyers receive a 5% discount, on average, on membership 

seats.  Also, there is strong evidence of network effects between German buyers and sellers and 

Jewish buyers and sellers.  It was highly likely for these groups to enter into nominal 

transactions, effectively keeping seats within a given ethnicity.  This may have been a method to 

ensure entrance of minorities into the Stock Exchange while circumventing discrimination, 

highlighting the importance of “network effects” in this scenario. 

The results from the models estimated for rejected transactions show a different result 

regarding discrimination than do the price differentials.  Jewish buyers are much more likely to 

be rejected, compared to other ethnicities, yet the regressions on price show these buyers 

receiving discounts on seat prices.  This may occur because the rejected transactions are 

concentrated in an earlier period and may reflect attitudes that changed over time. 

This study shows that the effects of discrimination existed on the Stock Exchange, but 

that such discrimination may not have been systematic but associated more with certain events. 

This is an interesting result as it highlights the impact of certain events, while showing that, on 

average, minorities were not charged higher prices.  A natural extension of this study would be to 

examine the relationship between the ethnic composition of New York and the ethnic 

composition of the Stock Exchange, looking for the relative penetration of minorities at the 

Stock Exchange, and construct regressions that measured large increases in immigration, to see if 

there were any potential discriminatory backlashes against minorities.
