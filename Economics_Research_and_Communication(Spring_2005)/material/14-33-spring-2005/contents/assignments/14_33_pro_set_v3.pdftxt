Problem Set 1 
Due 2/16/2004 in TA's mail folder by noon.
The Clean Air Act  has  been  one  of  the most  controversial  interventions  into  the marketplace  by 
the  federal  government  in  the  post-World War  II  period.   Much  of  this  controversy  is  generated 
by  an  absence  of  information  on  the  costs  and  benefits  of  these  policies.    Recently,  this 
controversy has  centered on  the wisdom of  regulating  small particulates air pollution.   The EPA 
contends that these small particulates have pernicious effects on human health, yet many find the 
evidence  to be  inconclusive.  I am  in  the midst of a  research project  that examines  the effects of 
total  suspended particulates  (TSPs)  air pollution on  infant health.  This problem  set will  involve 
you in the scientific process of discovery in “real time”.    

Feel  free  to work cooperatively but each person  is  required  to  turn  in  their own problem  set  that 
provides  the  solutions  in  their own words.  The answer key will be posted  immediately after  the 
problem sets are due; hence late problem sets will not be accepted. 

For those of you who become interested in this topic, you might be interested in reading: 
Chay, Kenneth, and Michael Greenstone.  (2003). “Air Quality, Infant Mortality and the Clean 
Air Act of 1970.” Available at: http://dsl.nber.org/papers/w10053.pdf. 

Chay, Kenneth Y., and Michael Greenstone, “The Impact of Air Pollution on Infant Mortality: 
Evidence from Geographic Variation in Pollution Shocks Induced by a Recession,” Quarterly 
Journal of Economics, CXVIII (2003), 1121-1167. 

The first paper may be useful in completing this problem set. 

Data Source: tspsimr7172.dta (available on the assignment section) 

This  data  file  contains  observations  from  501  counties.    Each  observation  records  the  change 
between 1972 and 1971 (i.e., the 1972 minus the 1971 value) for each of the variables.  There are 
two exceptions: 

a.  tbirth1  which  equals  the  sum  of  the  1971  and  1972  number  of  births.    This  variable 
should  be  used  as  a  weight  in  ALL  regressions  in  this  exercise  (you  can  use  what  STATA 
refers to as “analytical weights”). 

b.  reg_tsp  which  equals  1  for  tsps  nonattainment  counties  and  0  otherwise.    The 
centerpiece  of  the  Clean  Air  Act  was  its  efforts  to  clean-up  “dirty”  counties.    These  counties 
were designated as nonattainmnet  (i.e.,  their air quality did not attain  the  federal standards).   All 
other  counties  were  considered  attainment.    The  key  issue  for  this  problem  set  is  that  polluters 
faced more stringent regulatory oversight in the nonattainment counties.   

The  relevant  variables  are  listed  in  four  separate  categories  and  all  have  descriptions  in 
quotations:

4. Per-Capita Income 
dpcinc “per-capita income 72-71” 

The  data  file  is  available  at  the  assignments  section.  Please  include  a  constant  term,
analytic  weights  (using the tbirth1 variable) and robust standard errors in all of your regressions. 

1. 

Graph dimr7271 against damtsp1.   

a)	 Does it look like there is an association between changes in infant mortality and tsps? 
(Please label the axes.) 

b)  A  nice  feature  in  Stata  is  that  it  allows  for  the  size  of  the  points  on  a  graph  to  vary 
with  a  variable;  this  is  done  by  setting  the  weight  =  the  variable  of  interest.  Now 
graph  dimr7271  against  damtsp1  and  set  weight  equal  to  tbirth1.    Does  there  appear 
to  be  a  relationship?  (It  is  easier  to  see  the  graph  if  you  use  hollow  markers  rather 
than filled in ones.)  

2. 
We  now  want  to  prove  the  robustness  of  the  findings  in  1.    Regress  dimr7271  on 
damtsp1.   

a)  Is there evidence of a relationship here? 

b)  Now add the “Basic Natality” control variables.  Are any of these variables important 
determinants of infant mortality?   

c)  Have your conclusions about the TSPs/infant mortality relationship changed? 

3. 
One  explanation  for  this  result  is  that  there  are  many  unmeasured/unobservable 
confounding  factors  that  determine  both  dimr7271  and  damtsp1.    Examples  of  these  types  of 
variables include: health insurance status, rates of smoking across mothers, and parents’ income.   

a) 	 Now interpret your findings in 1. 

If  changes  in  TSPs  were  randomly  assigned,  we  could  be  certain  that  the  ‘omitted 
variables  bias’  problem  described  in  (3)  was  unimportant.    Obviously,  a  randomized  (or 
classical) experiment is unethical.  In the absence of a classical experiment, one solution is to use 
a  “natural  experiment”,  where  the  researcher  exploits  differences  in  outcomes  between  a 

Page 3

treatment  group  and  a  control  group,  just  as  in  a  classical  experiment.    In  the  case  of  a  natural 
experiment,  however,  treatment  status  is  determined  by  nature,  politics,  or  some  other  action 
beyond  the  researcher’s  control.  Despite  the  “nonrandom”  nature  of  the  treatment  status,  it  is 
still  possible  to  draw  valid  inferences  from  the  differences  in  outcomes  between  the  treatment 
and  control  groups  in  a  natural  experiment,  provided  certain  (potentially  testable)  assumptions 
are met. 

The  premise  of  this  exercise  is  that  the  1970 Clean Air Act Amendments might  qualify  as  a 
valid  “natural  experiment”.    This  legislation  set  air  quality  standards  for  TSPs  that  all  counties 
are required to obtain.  In counties that did not meet the standards, TSPs emitters were subject to 
harsh  regulations  that  required  them  to  reduce  their  emissions  of  TSPs  (we  can  think  of  this  as 
the  treatment),  while  emitters  in  “clean”  counties  were  relatively  free  from  regulation  (we  can 
think of this as the control).  I have collected the information for whether a county was regulated 
heavily  and  coded  it  as  a  variable  that  is  equal  to  1  for  heavily  regulated  counties  and  0 
otherwise.  The variable name is reg_tsp.   

4. 	

Run a regression to determine whether TSPs declined more in heavily regulated counties.    

a)  What does the parameter on the regulation variable mean in words? 

b)  Does the result remain when you control for the covariates that were specified in (2)? 

c)  What  is  your  conclusion  about  the  effect of  the Clean Air Act Amendments on TSPs 
concentrations? 

5. 
Run  a  regression  to  determine  whether  infant  mortality  rates  declined  more  in  heavily 
regulated counties. 

a) What does the parameter on the regulation variable mean in words? 

b) Does this result remain when you control for the covariates that were specified in (2)? 

c) What is your conclusion about the effect of the Clean Air Act Amendments on infant  
mortality rates? 

6. 
Two-stage  least  squares  provides  a  method  to  combine  the  results  from  (4)  and  (5)  in 
order  to  infer  the  relationship  between  infant mortality  and  TSPs  (recall,  this  is  the  relationship 
that  we  are  actually  interested  in).  The  intuition  is  that  the  regulations  may  isolate  changes  in 
TSPs  that  are  unrelated  to  the  sources  of  omitted  variables  bias  that were  discussed  in  (3);  thus, 
the regulations may serve as a natural experiment.   

a)  Run  a  two-stage  least  squares  regression  (which  is  equivalent  to  instrumental 
variables  estimation  here)  to  find  the  effect  of  changes  in  TSPs  on  changes  in  IMRs, 
without  controlling  for  any  other  explanatory  variables.   That  is,  you want  to  regress  the 
change  in  infant mortality on  the change  in TSPs, instrumenting the change in TSPs with 

Page 4

the  regulation  variable  (reg_tsp).  Don’t  forget  to  include  the  weights  and  to  use  the 
“robust” command for robust standard errors. 
{Read  the  STATA manual  to make  sure  that  you  understand  the  commands  being 
used here.}.  What do the results suggest?  What does the parameter on damtsp1 mean in 
words? 

b) 	 Now control for the “Basic Natality Variables.”  Did your findings change? 

c)	 Now control for  the “Unrestricted Natality Variables” and “Per-Capita Income”.   Did 
your findings change? 

d)  Are  the  results  in  (a)  sensitive  to  controlling  for  a wide  set  of  available  predictors  of 
infant  mortality?    What  do  you  conclude  about  the  relationship  between  infant 
mortality and tsps? 

7. 
With  the benefit of hindsight,  should  the Clean Air Act Amendment have been passed  in 
1970?  Why or why not?
