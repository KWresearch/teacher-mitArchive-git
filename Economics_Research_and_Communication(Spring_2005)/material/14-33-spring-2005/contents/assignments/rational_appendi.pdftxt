Rational Addiction and Massively Multiplayer Games:  

A case study of World of Warcraft

By Nicholas Hunter 


Introduction 
Video games have been receiving a negative public image for, among 
various other reasons, their “addictive” qualities.  It is a cliché of the 20th and 21st 
centuries to brand nascent media forms as the “downfall of modern society,” so why give 
it a second thought?  What’s particularly interesting in the case of the discourse 
surrounding video games is that the consumers under scrutiny, gamers, will often freely 
admit their “addiction” to games.  Particularly, Massively Multiplayer Online 
Roleplaying Games (MMORPG, or MMO) have received the dubious moniker, within 
the gaming community, of being a hardcore drug.1  Given the concerns of society and the 
purported addictive nature of MMOs, it is an appealing candidate for study. 
 This paper attempts to determine whether World of Warcraft, an acclaimed and 
relatively new MMO, is addictive to its players, and if so, what breed of addiction it 
engenders.  Rational Addiction theory as developed by Stigler and Becker (1977) and 
Becker and Murphy (1988) provide theoretical tools to test these hypotheses.  The dataset 
used in this paper restricts the scope of all conclusions to concern the behaviors of World 
of Warcraft players.  Ultimately, there are indications that World of Warcraft players are 
experiencing addiction, but the data is inconclusive as to whether it is beneficial or 
harmful.  A more ideal research plan will also be proposed in the process of discussing 
methods and results.  

Theoretical Models 
Rational Addiction Model 
Chaloupka (1991) does a good job of summarizing the mathematics and theory 
behind B&M (1988), so the reader is referred to that for a more comprehensive coverage 

1 For example, one of the progenitors of the genre, EverQuest, has maintained the nickname “EverCrack” 
for most of its 6 year history.  Also, it is not uncommon to hear new releases to be referred to as a new form 
of “crack.”

of the topic.  The basic assumptions and formulae underlying the rational addiction model 
are presented here. 
Put simply, if consuming a good in the past increases how much of that good you 
consume in the future, we say that the good is addictive.  Once it is established that a 
good is addictive, we look at the long-run elasticity of demand in order to determine what 
kind of addiction the user is experiencing, either Negative or Beneficial.  In economic 
terms, cocaine and tobacco are classic examples of negatively addictive products, not 
because of the negative health effects that one receives from consuming them,2 but rather, 
because of the addict’s high resistance to price shocks resulting from an inelastic demand 
curve for the product.  As S&B (1977) emphasizes, the inelasticity of the demand curve 
is responsible for the negative nature of the addiction, and not the other way around.  
 On the other hand, music appreciation is demonstrative of Beneficial Addiction.3 
The more good music a person listens to, the more good music they want to listen 
to.  Unlike negatively addictive products though, beneficially addictive goods have a high 
elasticity of demand, and are thus very sensitive to price shocks.   If, for example, the 
price of opera tickets were doubled, and opera consumption is a beneficially addictive 
good to opera fans, then we would expect that, despite their fandom, the number of 
operas viewed by the opera fans would fall to less than 50% of the previous number of 
operas viewed. 
Thus, “Negative Addiction” is simply an addictive good whose consumption is 
resistant to changes in price, and “Beneficial Addiction” is an addictive good whose 
consumption is very sensitive to price.   
In the Rational Addiction model, the consumer’s instantaneous utility function 
takes the form: 

t Y 
t A 
t C  ), 
t U  ) = U [
( ),
(
( 
( 
)]  (1) 
t C )  is consumption of the good in question at time t , 
t Y )  is the consumption of

(
where 
t A  ) is the addictive stock4 related to the good in question 
all other goods at time t , and 
(

As Chaloupka (1991) states, Equations (2), (3), and (5) illustrate three key properties of 
addictive goods.  Equation (2) describes withdrawal from a good, as reducing 
consumption of the good in question reduces the consumer’s overall utility.  Equation (3) 
describes tolerance; ceteris paribus , greater cumulative past consumption lowers current 
utility.  Equation (5) describes reinforcement; the marginal utility of current consumption 
is larger as past consumption is greater. 
Prior to any consumption of the good in question, 
following manner: 

t A  ) develops in the

t A  ) = 0 . 
(

t C  ) −δ t A  ) (7)

where δ is the depreciation rate of the addictive stock.5 
Rational addiction implies that addicts will attempt to maximize their lifetime 
utility function.  Assuming a time-additive utility function,6 a constant rate of time 
preference, σ , and an infinite lifetime, the lifetime utility function takes the form:

Chaloupka (1991) then develops the full price for consuming an addictive good by 
ignoring the allocation of time over the life cycle, setting  PY  (t ) = 1 , and perfect capital 
markets.  The full price is then:

7 is always negative, the full price, π C (t ) , is always greater than the 
Since U A 
instantaneous cost,  PC (t ) .  So as the addiction stock of the good in question rises, the full 
price of consuming the good in question also rises.  Equilibrium is expected to form as 
the full price of consuming a good rises until the good becomes too expensive to continue 
to increase consumption levels.  If the depreciation rate of the addictive stock increases, 
then the shadow price created by the addictive stock falls, increasing overall consumption.  
Also, if the rate of time preference increases, then the full price falls, raising the 
equilibrium level of consumption.8 

Massively Multiplayer Online Games 
There are some concepts specific to the MMO genre of games that should be 
defined so that people unfamiliar with the genre or with games in general, will have a 
better understanding of the systems and experiences discussed.   
MMOs are virtual worlds that continue to exist even while a player is not playing 
the game.  Generally speaking, several thousand players will be playing in the virtual 
world at any given point in time.  The state of a world at any given point in time is 
defined by what players are in the world, and what action they are undertaking.  
•	 Player Character (PC): The in-game representation of a player.  PCs generally 
have a complex set of statistics that govern how they can interact with the world. 
•	 Character Level: A character’s level is a measure of the power that the character 
possesses, and is, to some extent, a proxy for how much time a player has 
invested in a PC.  In WoW, the maximum level a PC can currently have is 60.

•	 Communication Channels: Players can communicate with one another using text 
chat similar to an Instant Messenger.  While there is some filtering that can go on, 
the basic kinds of communication are Private, Public, and Broadcast.  Private 
communications are only visible to the person that sends the message and the 
person that is was sent to.  Public communications are visible to the person that 
sends the message and anyone that is within close physical proximity within the 
geography of the game world.  Broadcast communications are visible to anyone 
that is listening to the “channel” that the message is broadcasted to.9 
As a player progresses through the game by increasing the level of their character, 
or “leveling up,” the fundamental experiences involved in play do not change drastically.  
What does change is the amount of time that the game requires of players in order to 
achieve particular measures of success.  For example, to go from level 1 to level 2, it 
requires 1-2 hours on average.  To go from level 59 to level 60, it can require upwards of 
24 hours of play.  So while the nature of the product does not drastically change from 
initial consumption, the reward structure shifts so that it requires players to progressively 
invest more time in order to maintain their prior levels of rewards received from the game.  
The general consensus is that this kind of reward structure encourages increasing length 
of play, which would make it an addictive property. 
It should be noted that there is no end condition for MMOs.  Players are free to 
inhabit the virtual world so long as they continue to pay their monthly fee.  In fact, much 
of the new content added to the game revolves around giving new content to those who 
have achieved the pinnacle of the game’s level system. 

Methods 
This paper uses a modified version of the applied model Chaloupka (1991) 
developed to estimate the elasticity of demand for the consumption of World of Warcraft 
playtime, CWoW, measured in units of time.   
The models that Chaloupka (1991) offers are as follows: 

9 For example, a person that is the member of a social organization called a guild can send a message to the 
guild’s chat channel.  Any member of the guild, no matter where they are in the game world, will receive 
the message.

Equations (10) and (11) represent the instantaneous demand for C.  It is easier to get data 
that fits Equation (10), however, the data collection period for this paper was restricted, 
and so the remainder shall use Equation (11) as the basis for empirical analysis.   
The major discrepancy between previous studies and this case study is that the 
usual monetary price for our good CWoW is fixed at a monthly rate.  So, if we take the 
usual assumption that price is the monetary cost per unit of consumption, PWoW, t is then 
inversely proportional to CWoW, t, as an increase in CWoW, t from any positive quantity 
incurs no additional monetary cost. 
This is not a problem that solely relates to the consumption of WoW, or even 
games in general.  Let’s take a step back and look at the consumption patterns of media 
products.  The monetary price that one pays to gain access to the product is by all means 
the first step in the decision making process for consumption.  However, once one has 
access to the good, a second process of valuation begins to occur: “how long will I 
consume the product for?”  The utility of the specific activity in its simplest form is 
presumably of the form: 

Completion 
∫ 
I U 
X  (t ))dt (12)
(
0 
Activity 
U
( 
)  is equal to the  total utility received from consuming the 
where 
entertainment product,  I X (t )  is the intensity of entertainment that is delivered at the 
instantaneous point in time t. 
Now let’s take a brief look at the decision process behind deciding to “put down” 
an activity and start up another one.  The general form of the equation, taken from 
marginal decision making theory, would be: 
Completion  [
Completion 
∫ Current

So if a consumer expects that they will get more marginal utility per cost out of starting 
to consume a new entertainment product than finishing the one that they’re currently 
consuming, they will switch products.  However, how do we describe the price of 
finishing product X,  PX (t )   If rigid definitions of monetary price are maintained, then 
technically  PX (t )  is zero, in which case there are no expectations that people would 
switch entertainment products midway, unless  PY (t )  also happens to be 0. 
And yet this switching behavior is not an infrequent occurrence.  It seems likely 
that somebody has stopped consuming a book, TV, or game in deference to doing some 
other activity.  If the opportunity cost of continuing to consume the entertainment good is 
not accounted for in the price of continued consumption, then the model of marginal 
decision making seem to fall apart when looking at an individual’s consumption 
patterns.11 
Traditional economics does offer a method for evaluating the opportunity cost of 
a good.  At the margin, the cost of non-productive time is the person’s wage rate.  This 
will be one of the models used to evaluate the price of playing, namely: 
P t X  = wt  (14)
, 
where wt is the person’s wage rate for that period of time. Overall utility levels are 
maintained when trading between activities when time is evaluated in this manner.   
The wage rate method of time valuation solves the problem of having  PX (t )  equal 
zero, but it seems to best describe evaluating opportunity cost of other activities versus 
P i Y 
,  12 solves the problem of having infinite marginal value in 
t 
Equation (13), at which point, any relative valuations of activities are captured in the 
utility function in the numerator.  However, Equation (11) requires that we have a single 
price statistic for each period; as stated before, the wage rate model does not seem to 
sufficiently capture the valuation of playing WoW versus all other activities.  For this 

work.  PX  = w and PY  = w + 

11 To explain a person returning to a product they put down, it is simply a matter that the marginal utility 
per cost of all other activities has sunk below that of the product that’s being returned to.

reason, an approach to develop a relative value of time spent playing WoW versus other 
as an estimate of the opportunity cost for playing WoW is proposed.   

Assumptions for the Time Valuation Model 
The motivation for this model is to attempt to develop a metric for the opportunity 
cost of changing the allocation of time given to a particular activity, without directly 
observing the monetary repercussions of changing said allocation.  The opportunity cost 
of a given activity is assumed to be the net-utility given up by making a change in a 
consumer’s allocation of time. 
First, this model withdraws the usual assumption that the consumer is efficient 
and always finds their optimal indifference curve.  This is not to say that the consumer is 
not rational and does not attempt to maximize their utility, but rather, that they are often 
unable to find their optimal indifference curve because of shifting valuations and 
information asymmetry.  Thus, when a person makes a behavior shift, they will likely 
also shift the indifference curve that they occupy.13  The consumer’s utility function takes 
the form: 

A U  1(t ), A2(t ),..., 
t An  )]  (15) 
t U  ) =
[ 
(
(
and the indifference curve for any particular activity is the partial derivative of (15) with 
respect to the consumption of the activity in question.  The partial derivative of the 
indifference curve for Activity j, 

(16)

U jk  (t ) =

t U  ) 
(
∂ 2
t Aj  )∂
t Ak  ) 
(∂
( 
 is of particular importance because it describes the relationship of Activities j and k.  If 
U 
jk (t ) is positive, the two activities are complementary.  If U jk (t )  is negative, the two 
activities are substitutes.   
Second, the currency in question is time, and the consumption good is the 
allocation of that time.  This has two useful properties: 

13This may invalidate some of the assumptions made to obtain Chaloupka’s shadow price in Equation (9), 
namely, the ignoring of the allocation of time over the lifetime.  Suggestions for how to resolve this logic 
problem are welcomed.

Time Property 1:  It is a zero-sum system; a change in one variable is reflected 
in an equal and opposite net change dispersed throughout all other variables 
T = ∑ 
t Ai  )  (17) 
(
Time Property 2:  All sample members are equally wealthy; everyone has the 
same amount of time to allocate 
Time Property 1 suggests that any positive change in one variable should 
precipitate a negative change in another variable.  Ceteris paribus, the effect of a change 
in the allocation of time for one activity on another activity should demand a direct trade 
off between the two activities.  The budget for any given activity is then: 
Observed = T  − ∑ 
A
t Ai  )  (18)
(
where the partial derivative of Equation (18) with respect to any activity should be equal 
to -1. 

The interactions of the indifference curves from Equation (16) and the budget 
constraint of Equation (18) are significant.  If a positive change in one variable affects a 
positive change in another variable, then it simply means that a greater negative change 
must happen elsewhere in the system in order to accommodate the greater overall 
positive change.  Thus, we will be able to accept positive relationships between various 
activities so long as there is at least one negative relationship among all of the 
relationships between a particular activity and every other activity.   
Time Property 2 benefits the empirical application of the model, as it states that 
all sample members possess the same amount of the currency, which makes sample 
members more relatable, even if demographic factors are disparate.

allocation of time, our consumption good, and  ∆ActivityAt  is the cost incurred on 
ActivityA for making that allocation.  If there is no preference in which activity time is 
drawn from to accommodate an increase in an activity, we would expect all the β s to be 
the equal.  As later empirical analysis will show though, this is not the case.  The sign of 
∆ActivityAt  will be determined by the relationship between the ActivityA and ActivityB. 
If the ActivityA and ActivityB are substitutes, then  ∆ActivityAt  and  ∆ActivityB  should 
have opposite signs.  If the two are complementary, then  ∆ActivityAt  and  ∆ ActivityB
should have the same signs.  While at first thought it may seem unlikely for  ∆ ActivityAt
and  ∆ActivityB  to be the same sign, remember that Time Property 1 merely requires that 
the net-change in the overall system be opposite and equal to ∆ ActivityB .16

that higher prices are more expensive, as is required for the dynamics of Equation (11) to 
behave properly. 
Next, the total price of an activity is found in the sum the price of each activity 
relative to all other reported activities.  Ceteris paribus is preserved, as only the change in 
one variable from each regression, ActivityB, is under inspection when totaling the price.

PWoW (t )  describes the relationship between playing WoW and all other activities.  
Time Property 1 suggests that  PWoW (t )  should be equal to positive unity in order to 
preserve the zero-sum system.  If we find that  PWoW (t ) ≠ 1 , then one of two things is 
happening.  One possibility is that the set of observed activities was not comprehensive 
enough. This can be checked fairly easily by comparing the average time reported by 
sample members to the absolute time available for the period under examination.17  The 
other possibility is that the valuations of all other activities compared to WoW are not 
WoW .18  In this case, the valuation of playing WoW 
balanced as a perfect substitute for  C
t 
, 
is not in equilibrium with the all other activities.  PWoW (t ) < 1  suggests that utility would 
be increased by consuming more WoW.19  PWoW (t ) > 1  suggests that utility would be 
decreased by consuming more WoW.20  PWoW (t )  becomes an indicator of the valuation of 
playing WoW versus all other observed activities.  If  PWoW (t )  is not positive, then the 
basket of activities has likely omitted a significant substitute activity that is important to 
the sample under investigation.21 
The regression model to determine addiction, drawn from Equation (11), is as 
follows: 

17 For example, if sample members report on average 160 of the 168 (95%) hours in a week, then basket 
comprehensiveness is less likely to be a problem than if they only report on average 84 of the 168 (50%) 
hours in a week.  The latter suggests that some major activities were excluded from survey.

Data 

There are no published datasets available to the general community regarding 
usage statistics of WoW or any other MMO games.  The dataset presented in conjunction 
with this paper was collected by interviewing a randomly selected sample of WoW 
players spread across 13 different servers.  Members of the sample went through an 
initial interview and a follow up interview approximately a month’s time after the initial 
interview.    
Several measures were taken to acquire an independently and identically 
distributed random sample.  First, a server was selected at random.  Then, prior to an 
initial interview, potential sample members were selected by generating two evenly 
distributed random numbers.  The first number, ranging from 1 to 60, was used to 
determine the level of the PC.  The second number, ranging from 1 to 26, was used to 
determine the first letter of the name of the potential sample member.  If, after applying 
these filters, there were no players that fit these two criteria, then the process would be 
restarted from the beginning.  If there were multiple PCs that fit the criteria, then a third 
random number, whose range was the number of players meeting the criteria, was 
generated and used to select one of the candidates (still in alphabetical order).  Character 
levels are not evenly distributed from 1 to 60, but a fair representation of the distribution 
is expected because the second filter the second filter rejected more often when there 
were fewer people at any particular level. 
After a candidate was selected, they would be contacted over WoW’s private 
communication channel.  While there is some variation in the expression, the initial 
contact message basically was: 

12 

“hi, I’m doing a survey for a class and was wondering if you’d be willing 
to lend a hand by answering a few quick questions.” 

If the player agreed,22 then they would be asked the following series of questions: 
1)  How many hours a week do you play WoW?

2)  Have you previously played an MMO? If so, for how long?

3)  How many hours a week do you spend on other leisure activities? (e.g. other 

games, television, reading, going out, etc.) 
4)  How many hours per week do you work? (school, job, etc.) 
5)  How many hours a day do you sleep? 
6)  How much time a day do you spend eating? 
7)  How much time a day do you spend showering, brushing your teeth, etc.? 
8)  Do you regularly consume caffeine, tobacco, or alcohol?  If so, how many times 
per week? 
9)  Which pricing plan do you use for WoW? (optional) 
10)  Finally, would you be willing to answer a similar set of questions in a month’s 
time?23 

These questions were asked using a chat macro that sent the above questions in their 
exact form to each sample member.  The succeeding question was not asked until the 
previous question had been answered, so that later questions would not influence earlier 
questions.  If data was given as a range, it was input into the dataset as the average of the 
range. 

The follow up interview, approximately a month after the initial interview, 
required finding a player when they were logged on.24  When the player became available, 
they were asked the following set of questions: 
1)  How many hours a week do you play WoW?

2)  How many hours a week do you spend on other leisure activities? (e.g. other 

games, television, reading, going out, etc.) 
3)  How many hours per week do you work? (school, job, etc.)

9)  How many months have you been subscribed to WoW? 
10)  Do you regularly play WoW with people you know from real life? 
11)  Do you have any alternate characters?  If so, what’s your highest level 
character? 
12)  Do you believe that you are addicted to WoW?  If so, do you think playing 
WoW has a negative impact on your life? 

The follow up interview was conducted in the same manner as the initial interview, so all 
follow up questions were asked in the same order and language. 
Character data that was accessible by using WoW’s “/who <charactername>” 
function, as well as information about the server’s population and rule set has also been 
included.  Players on RP servers were not interviewed for this sample, as I viewed it as 
excessively intrusive for that context, and it also ran a higher risk of my presence being 
reported as a nuisance to the game’s authorities, which could potentially result in a 
suspension of the privilege to enter WoW. 
Income data was taken from the Bureau of Labor Services website, which means 
all income figures are medians of weekly income from the year 2004.  I have adjusted 
them to reflect the wage rate for a 40 hour work week. 
The price data used for the application of the Time Valuation model will break 
down the sample into two groups based upon age, 13-22 and 23+.  The prices are 
generated by performing the matrix of regressions in Equation (19) separately, and then 
regressing Equation (24) with the values generated from Equation (23) subbed in 
appropriately.25 

Results 
S&B (1977) suggests that one can determine whether a good is “beneficially” or 
“negatively” addictive by examining the long-run elasticity of demand for the good.  The 
elasticity of demand is determined using the following equation:   
∂C *  P 
P 
Φ 1  Φ + 
2 
Φ 4  C * 
∂P C * 
1  Φ − 
3  −

26 Chaloupka (1991), pg. 730 

14 

where δ is the percentage of addictive stock that depreciates between periods, P is the 
price of our good, and C* is the ideal level of consumption for the individual.27 
Chaloupka (1991) points out that the roots of Equation (25) are useful in 
describing the dynamics of addictive good consumption, as the good is addictive if and 
only if both roots are positive.

The signs of the roots are then dependent on  Φ 3  , which is positive when a good is 
addictive.  λ1  , the smaller root, gives us the change in current consumption as the result 
of a shock to future consumption.  The inverse of λ , the larger root, gives us the change 
2
in current consumption as the result of a shock to past consumption.  These shocks would 
result from any factor affecting consumption of the good in question, including past and 
future prices. 

27 As a proxy for C* we will be using the sample’s semi quartile average.  For the price, the overall average 
wage is used for the Wage Rate Valuation model, and the future price is used to evaluate the Time 
Valuation model.

The practical effect of the addiction stock seems to dominate calculations of 
elasticity and lambda.  Given its crude formation, negligible statistical significance, and 
minimal variation, it’s hard to accept the results.  Meanwhile, the strong statistical 
significance of future consumption on current consumption suggests that there is in fact 
an addictive effect taking place.  If the Rational Addiction model’s interpretation is 
adhered to then, a negative addiction has been observed.  However, Chaloupka’s 
provision that both of the roots must be positive for a good to be addictive is violated; 
this likely because of the misbehavior of the Addictive Stock. 
The reason that the coefficient for current price is not shown is because it 
exhibited autocorrelation with future price.  However, given the extremely small size of 
the sample, and the fact that only two demographic groups were used to generate the 
price statistics, this is not very surprising.  Also, we see an anomaly with a negative 
future price for the 13-22 year old group.  Again, this is likely a result of the extremely 
small size of the sample examined (N = 12).  See Appendix 2 for the full results of the 
regressions. 
The prices drawn from the full sample indicate a significant, negative relationship 
between playing WoW and working.  Given that the large practical size of the coefficient 
for work (50%-60%) this supports the usage of the wage rate valuation model as a 
method of evaluating the opportunity cost for playing WoW, and also perhaps why we 
get similar values for the coefficient on Future Consumption.  However, only accounting 

17 

for work suggests that 40%+ of the opportunity cost is still unaccounted for, which is 
why the Time Valuation model warrants more investigation. 

Ideal Research Plan 
The empirical application of the Rational Addiction model and Time Valuation 
models presented here are less than desirable, as the former prefers long time series in 
order to understand trends in behavior and the latter requires a larger sample to break 
down demographically.  Thus the first recommendation is to extend the period of 
observation beyond the two-period valuation presented in this paper, and develop a 
cohort whose time management behaviors are tracked on a monthly basis for a 1-2 year 
period.28  Preferably, the cohort would be developed at the release of a new MMO, in 
particular, one that draws in both veterans and new comers.   
While there are some benefits afforded by doing in game interviews, in the end, 
the logistical hassle of tracking down sample members makes it a rather inefficient 
approach to the data collection process.  Other lines of communication, such as email or 
web form, should be opened with cohort members so they may be contacted as necessary.  
This is particularly useful in scenarios where a cohort member may have decided to stop 
playing the game altogether.  If the web form option were to chosen, giving subjects the 
ability to add additional fields for other time consuming activities could be a valuable 
way to ensure a more comprehensive data set with respect to time activities. 
The Rational Addiction model is particularly useful in identifying addiction, and 
then quantifying it in the price elasticity.  However, it tells us very little qualitative 
information about the addiction.  While there are indications in this paper of addiction, 
neither the Rational Addiction model nor the Time Valuation model grant an 
understanding of why there is an addiction, least as they are used in this paper.   
The desired qualitative information can, however, be inferred if there were a 
larger sample size and a higher resolution of demographic data.  Cross sections could 
then be broken down by income level, age, membership to in game social institutions, 
and other demographic factors in order to get more precise valuations of time for each 

28 The size of the cohort and the length of the study are of course up to the researcher, but of course, the 
more people in the cohort and the longer the period of observation, the more reliable the results. 

18 

group of users.  Equation (24) could then be regressed using the more diversified price 
sample.  The long-run price elasticity of demand could then be compared from group to 
group.  We can then infer from the demographic groups with more inelastic demand 
properties of consumers to whom a good is particularly addictive.  Given the proper 
demographic properties, such as the subject’s preference particular game systems, what 
aspects of a game or product are particularly addictive could also be empirically tested.  

Conclusion 
Unfortunately, the dataset developed for this paper simply was not large enough 
to properly test the models described herein, particularly, the Time Valuation model.  
Regardless of the model employed though, there is a strong statistical relationship 
between consumption across various time periods suggests that there is some form of 
addiction taking place.  However, there simply isn’t enough data here to say definitively 
whether it is beneficial or harmful.

Appendix I 
Proposal for Time Valuation Equilibrium Model 
The regression model used to determine the relationship between CWoW,t and all 
other activities is actually a subset of the overall decision making process that I believe is 
going on.  Not only are there relationships in the time valuation of CWoW,t versus all other 
activities, but we should expect that there such are relationships between all activities. 
Using the regression model used in this paper as an example, we should have a matrix of 
relationships such that: 
Hygiene  Hygiene  (A1)
Eat  Eat t  + β t 
Work  Work t  + βSleep Sleept  + β t 
Other  Othert  + β t

If the model is comprehensive, then a shock to one of the variables should have a 
ripple effect on all other variables in the model.  Eventually, the shock should settle down 
into an equilibrium determined by the matrix of coefficients.  We would then start to 
explain shifts in general behavior using shifts in the coefficients that moved the 
equilibrium allocations of time.  It is not clear that OLS is the best modeling technique 
for this kind of analysis; particularly given the possibility that beta could shift relative to 
the value of its related variable.29   A successful model will capture the relationships 
between all activities and allow the possibility for an equilibrium state. 

29 For example, a person would be more willing to give up 10 minutes of eating time if they had 2 hours 
allocated towards eating when compared to a person that only had 15 minutes allocated to eating
