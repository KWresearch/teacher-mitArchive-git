PROBLEM SET #1 

Due: Tuesday, February 8, 2005 

1.	

Consider the picture of the price equilibrium (e.g., Kreps, pg. 192) in the two-consumer, 
two-good case.  For each set of relative prices, we can mark the point that Consumer 1 
would demand.  (Assume that consumers have strictly convex preferences so their 
maximization problems always have unique solutions.)  As we vary the relative prices of 
the goods, we trace out a curve -- the so-called offer curve of Consumer 1.  This is shown 
for you in Figure 6.8.

We can create a similar offer curve for Consumer 2, and rotating the picture for 
Consumer 2 by 180 degrees and putting his origin at the location of the social endowment 
in her (Consumer 1's) coordinate system, we get the Edgeworth box with two offer 
curves.  Consider the assertion: Walrasian equilibrium allocations correspond to points 
where the two offer curves intersect.  This is not correct as it stands.  Why not?  If you 
see why not, try to repair the assertion.  (Kreps, 6.1)

Consider the following exchange economy.  There are two goods and two consumers.  
The two goods are called tillip and quillip and the two consumers are called 1 and 2.  
Consumer 1 has utility function  U1 ( q 
) (where t is the amount of tillip 
, t 
) = 
t 
ln(

q

1 consumes, and q is the amount of quillip).  Consumer 2 has utility function 
 Consumer 1 is endowed with 10 units each of quillip and 
U 2 ( q 
, t 
) =

tillip.  Consumer 2 is endowed with 10 units of quillip and 5 units of tillip. 

(a)	 What is the Walrasian equilibrium of this economy?  (If there is more than one 
equilibrium, give them all.) 

(b)	

Suppose a social dictator wished to implement an allocation that makes  
) as large as possible at the equilibrium.  Give all the possible 
U1 ( q 
, t 
) + U 2 ( q 
, t 
reallocations of the endowment that give the dictator's optimal endowment as a 
Walrasian equilibrium.  (Kreps, 6.2) 

A particular social planner I know is very big on mellow consumers.  Specifically, she 
hopes to prevent her consumers from envying each other.  To this end, she defines an 
envy-free allocation of resources as one in which no consumer would rather have the 
consumption bundle assigned to another consumer instead of his or her own.  Our social 
planner wishes to implement an envy-free allocation.  She also wishes the allocation to be 
efficient. 

This social planner is also lazy.  She isn't willing to figure out the utility functions of her 
consumers.  (She does have a good list of all their endowments.)  She is blessed with an 
economy that functions well as an exchange economy; however she reassigns 
endowments, the economy finds a Walrasian equilibrium. 

Can you help out this social planner?  Specifically, describe how to reallocate 
endowments so that the resulting Walrasian equilibrium is guaranteed to be both efficient 
and envy free.  (Hint: The trick is to find some way to redistribute endowments so that, at 
every set of prices, consumers all begin with same level of wealth to spend on 
consumption.  There is a way to redistribute endowments so this is true: What is it?)  
(Kreps, 6.3)

To illustrate the role of the assumptions used in proving results, give examples of the 
following (illustrate using an Edgeworth box). 

(i)  	

An exchange economy with no competitive equilibrium relative to particular 
initial endowments.

(ii) 

An exchange economy with an infinite number of competitive equilibria relative 
to particular initial endowments. 

(iii)  A Pareto optimum which cannot be sustained as a competitive equilibrium. 

(iv)  A competitive equilibrium which is not Pareto optimal.  (Do not use externalities 
to produce this example.)
