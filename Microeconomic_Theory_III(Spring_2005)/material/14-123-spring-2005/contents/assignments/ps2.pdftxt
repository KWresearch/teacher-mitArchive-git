PROBLEM SET #2 

Due: Tuesday, February 15, 2005 

Consider the following social choice problem in the setting of consumption of two 
goods by two consumers.  The two goods are called tillip and quillip and the two 
consumers are called 1 and 2.  Consumer 1 has utility function U1(t,q) = 6 + .4 ln(t) + .6 
ln(q) (where t is the amount of tillip 1 consumes and q is the amount of quillip).  
Consumer 2 has utility function U2(t,q) = 8 + ln(t) + ln(q).  The social endowment 
consists of 15 units of tillip and 20 units of quillip. 

What is the set of all feasible, Pareto efficient allocations of the consumption good for 
this society?  (Kreps, 5.2b.) 

In a perfectly competitive pure exchange economy, there are two types of persons, 
denoted by A and B, with equal numbers of each.  They consume goods X and Y, with 
utility functions: 

UA = X - 100 e-Y/10 + 47 for type A
UB = Y - 100 e-X/10 + 100 for type B 

and they have endowments of 40 of X for type A and 50 of Y for type B. 

(i)  Writing p for the relative price of Y, derive the demand functions of the two 
groups, and comment on their properties.  (Watch for corner solutions.) 

(ii) 

 Graphically, or otherwise, show that there are multiple competitive equilibria.  
(Hint: consider the local behavior of excess demand at p=1.) 

There are two goods X and Y and two consumers A and B with the following utility 
functions and endowments: 

UA = a ln XA + (1-a) ln YA,  EA = (0,1), 0<a<1. 
EB = (1,0). 
UB = min (XB,YB), 
 

Calculate the competitive equilibrium prices and allocation. (Varian 17.4)

 We have two agents with indirect utility functions: 

 
 

vA(p1,p2,yA) = ln yA -a ln p1 - (1-a) ln p2
vB(p1,p2,yB) = ln yB -a ln p1 - (1-a) ln p2

and initial endowments 

 

EA = (1,1), EB = (1,1). 

Calculate the competitive market clearing prices. (Varian 17.6) 

Consider an economy with 15 consumers and 2 goods.  Consumer 3 has a Cobb-Douglas 
utility function U3 = ln X + ln Y.  At a certain Pareto efficient allocation, consumer 3 
has an allocation (10,5).  What are the competitive  prices that support this Pareto 
optimal allocation? (Varian 17.9.) 

 Either prove or find a counterexample to the following proposition: 

In an economy with identical consumers, an increase in the endowment of one good will 
lead to a reduction in the price of that good relative to all other goods. 

Consider a competitive exchange economy with a continuum of consumers.  There is a 
unit measure of these consumers, indexed by j, with j being uniformly distributed in the 
interval between 1 and 2.  Consumer j has utility function 

 

Uj = x + jy 

and initial endowment Ej = ((1+j)-2, (1+j)-2). 

Describe the competitive equilibrium prices and allocation.
