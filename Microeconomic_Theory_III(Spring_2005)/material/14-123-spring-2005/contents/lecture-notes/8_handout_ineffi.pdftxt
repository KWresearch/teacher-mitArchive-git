II. Change in production with redistribution

As long as the income derivatives of A and B are different, these are nonzero.  Also the demand 
derivatives are evaluated at different prices and incomes in the different states.

constant k).

Generically we have different prices and demands in the two states and different marginal rates of 
substitution for the two agents. The aim is to find a constant, k, so that the changes in transfers leave 
both of them better off or both worse off (in which case we reverse the direction of transfers). This may 
be possible – this model does not fit the Inefficiency Theorem.  Contrasting (18) and (19) to (10) and 
(11), we have an extra degree of freedom in seeking a Pareto gain.   
 
k
For a Pareto gain, we need to find a value of 
 such that (18) and (19) are both positive or both 
negative (calling for a reversal of the direction of redistribution).  This requires
