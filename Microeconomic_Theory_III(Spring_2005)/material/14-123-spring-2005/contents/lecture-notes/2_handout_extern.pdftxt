Consider conditions for Pareto optimality for the subset of Pareto optima where everyone has 
positive income at the optimum. 
 
Note that in this case, income distribution does not matter for optimal road use and we can 
derive the optimal road use by maximizing the sum of utilities. 
 
There are other Pareto optima where these conditions do not hold – where all of the income 
goes to a subset of the people who get all the income and may also get a “better” road.

In general the equilibrium is not Pareto optimal. 
 
However, it can be Pareto optimal, for example, when only one road is used and when there is 
symmetry –

When equilibrium is not Pareto optimal, optimality can be restored either by taxing one of the 
roads or by subsidizing the other, with the revenue (or subsidy cost) covered by lump-sum taxes.  
When there are taxes on each road the equilibrium becomes
