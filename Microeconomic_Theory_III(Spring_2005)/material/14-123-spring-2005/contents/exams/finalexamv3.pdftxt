Consider a one-period competitive economy with a complete set of contingent commodity 
markets.  There are two states of nature.  There is one input good,  k , which must be 
allocated before the state of nature is known.  There are three consumer goods in each state 
of nature,  x ,  y , and  z .   There is one consumer, Ann, who is an expected utility 
maximizer, using subjective probabilities.

Ann’s consumption possibility set is the six dimensional space with nonnegative quantities 
of the consumer goods in each state of nature.  Ann has an initial endowment of 12 units of 
input. Ann owns all five firms that exist in the economy. 
 
For each unit of input used by firm 1, there are 4 units of good  x  produced if state 1 occurs 
and 4 units of good  x  produced if state 2 occurs.  
For each unit of input used by firm 2, there are 4 units of good  y  produced if state 1 occurs 
and nothing if state 2 occurs.  
For each unit of input used by firm 3, there are 4 units of good  y  produced if state 2 occurs 
and nothing if state 1 occurs.  
For each unit of input used by firm 4, there are 2 units of good  z  produced if state 1 occurs 
and nothing if state 2 occurs.

Does there exist a complete market competitive equilibrium?  If so, derive the competitive 
equilibrium prices and quantities.  If not, show why not.  Be sure to show the derivation of 
equations that describe equilibrium.  Be careful about corner conditions.
