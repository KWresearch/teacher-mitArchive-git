Labor  Economics—14.661 
Final  Examination 

Fall  2009 
Acemoglu/Angrist/Frandsen 

Instructions:  Read  the  entire  exam  ﬁrst.  The  exam  consists  of  two  parts.  Answer  5  out  of  6  questions 
in  Part  I  and  2  out  of  4  questions  in  Part  II. 

Please  use  a  separate  blue  book  for  each  long  question,  for  a  total  of  three  blue  books. 

This  is  a  three  hour  exam.  Good  Luck! 

Part  I:  Short-answer  (choose  5  out  of  6;  100  points) 

1.  “Target  earners  are  irrational.”  Discuss. 
2.  “An  OLS  regression  of  log  hours  worked  on  log  average  hourly  earnings  produces  an  estimate  of 
the  labor  supply  elasticity  that  is  too  low.”  True  or  false?  Give  a  brief  sketch  of  the  econometric 
reasoning  behind  your  answer. 
3.  The  EITC  appears  to  have  a  large  eﬀect  on  labor  supply.	 This  is  exactly  what  theory  predicts. 
Discuss  the  validity  of  both  of  these  statements. 
4.  In  a  series  of  articles  in  the  New  England  Journal  of  Medicine  and  other  outlets,  Christakis  and 
Fowler  document  that  individuals  whose  friends  have  friends  who  are  obese  are  more  likely  to 
be  obese.  They  interpret  this  as  the  eﬀect  of  “social  networks”  on  social  behavior.  What  other 
potential  explanations  might  exist  for  this  pattern? 
5.  Wage  losses  upon  separation  imply  that  ﬁrm  speciﬁc  human  capital  must  be  important.  True  or 
false? 
6.  The  fact  that  “riskier”  jobs  have  higher  powered  incentives  is  evidence  against  standard  agency 
models.  True  or  false? 

Part  II:  Longer  Questions  (choose  2  out  of  4;  200  points) 

1.  (NEW  BLUE  BOOK)  Now  for  a  little  .  .  .  monopsony  in motion! 
Suppose  that  N  small  fast  food  establishments  produce  according  to  f (L)  =  ln L,  with  ﬁxed

capital.

The  price  of  a meal  is  ﬁxed  at  $1. 

The  aggregate  labor  supply  function  for  counter  help  is  given  by  w� ,  for  positive  �.


(a)  Start  by  assuming  establishments  hire  individually  and  are  price-takers  in  the  labor  market. 
Derive  an  individual  establishment’s demand  curve.  Use  this  to derive  the  aggregate demand 
curve  for  counter  help. 
· 
(b)  Derive  the  competitive  equilibrium  wage  (wc )  and  aggregate  employment  level  (N Lc )  as  a 
function  of  the  labor  supply  elasticity  and  the  number  of  establishments. 
(c)  Now  suppose  that  the  ghost  of  Ray  Kroc  (an  eternal  monopsonist),  buys  these  N  establish­
ments  and  operates  them  as  one  ﬁrm  that  hires  on  behalf  of  all.  Assume  that  the  fast  food 
product  market  remains  competitive  in  spite  of  this  (he  has  to  compete  with  Burger  King 
and  Wendy’s).  However,  the  monopsonist  now  has  market  power  in  his  factor  market—in 
fact,  he  is  the  sole  employer  of  the  speciﬁc  type  of  labor  he  uses.  Derive  the  new  equilibrium 
· 
wage  (wm )  and  aggregate  employment  level  (N Lm ).
(d)  Explain how we can get competitive outcomes as a special case of the monospony equilibrium 
in  (c). 
(e)  Finally,  explain  how  a wise  and  beneﬁcent  government  can  generate  the  competitive  employ­
ment  level  as  an  equilibrium  outcome  in  spite  of  the  Kroc’s  market  power.  What  should 
Kroc’s  workers  do  if  wisdom  and  beneﬁcence  are  in  short  supply?

2.  (NEW BLUE BOOK) Analyze a  student  loan  crisis  in  the  context of a Becker/Card model where 
the  only  cost  of  schooling  is  forgone  wages.  An  individual  with  s  years  of  schooling  earns  yi  (s) 
forever  (an  increasing,  concave,  diﬀerentiable  function).  Schooling  is  chosen  to  max  the  PDV  of 
earnings  with  interest  rate  ri . 
(a)  What  does  a  student  loan  crisis  do  in  the  context  of  this  model?  Speciﬁcally,  use  the  model 
to  discuss  the  likely  consequences  of  the  student  loan  crisis  on 
i.  Rates  of  college  attendance  and  the  demographics  of  college  attendance 
ii.  The  average  return  to  college  attendance  and  how  this  varies  across  demographic  groups 
iii.  Long-run  vs  short  run  eﬀects  on  both  of  the  above 
A complete answer to this question will  include an  interpretation of the equilibrium condition 
that determines schooling choices, an investigation of changes in average returns as conditions 
in  the  student  loan  market  change,  and  a  (less  formal)  discussion  of  the  general  equilibrium 
consequences  of  a  change  in  the  relative  attractiveness  of  investments  in  human  capital. 
(b)  In  addition  to  subsidized  loans,  many  students  ﬁnance  their  education  through  grants  that 
are  eﬀectively  discounts  on  the  “sticker  price”  of  a  college  education.  With  colleges  cutting 
back  on  ﬁnancial  aid  as  their  endowments  shrunk,  the  sticker  price may  also  go  up. 
Analyze  the  eﬀect  of  tuition  increases  on  schooling  choices  using  a  model  similar  to  the  one 
used  in  part  (a),  above,  but  add  tuition  costs  in  the  amount  T  per  year.  Use  this  model 
to  show  that  if  everyone  pays  the  same  tuition,  then  raising  tuition  from  zero  to  an  amount 
equal  to  one-quarter  of  the  earnings  of  a  college  graduate  is  roughly  equivalent  to  increasing 
the  student  loan  interest  rate  by  25  percent.  Conclude  that  the  current  crisis  is  likely  to 
aﬀect  college  attendance  whether  or  not  the  government  succeeds  in  maintaining  the  supply 
of  subsidized  loans.  On  the  other  hand,  the  net  eﬀects  of  the  crisis  are  complicated  and  act 
in more  than one direction.  Discuss  the  channels  through which a  capital market  crisis might 
boost  college  enrollment. 
(c)  Brieﬂy  discuss  econometric  evidence  that  argues  in  favor  of  the  importance  of  liquidity  con­
straints  in  the  market  for  human  capital.  What  should  we  especially  look  for  by  way  of 
evidence  on  this  point  in  recent  data? 

3.  (NEW BLUE BOOK) Consider  the  following  economy.	 There  are  two ﬁrms  and  one worker.  The 
worker  has  ability  θ  distributed  uniformly  over  [0, 1].  Both  worker  and  ﬁrm  are  risk  neutral  and 
do  not  discount  between  the  periods.  The  timing  of  the  game  is  as  follows. 
•	 Each  ﬁrm  oﬀers  a  wage  W  to  hire  the  worker  (competing  a  la  Bertrand)  without  observing 
ability. 
•	 The  ﬁrm  that  hires  the  worker  decides  whether  to  provide  general  training  to  the  worker, 
denoted  by  τ  ∈ {0, 1}.  The  cost  of  training  is  c (τ ),  with  c (0) = 0,  c (1) =  c > 0.  The  entire 
cost  is  borne  by  the  ﬁrm.  The  training  of  the  worker  is  perfectly  observed  by  the  other  ﬁrm. 
•	 The  outside  ﬁrm  makes  a  wage  oﬀer  v (τ )  to  the  worker. 
•	 The  incumbent ﬁrm  (initial  employer) observes  the ability of  the worker and makes a  counter 
wage  oﬀer  w (τ ). 
•	 The  worker  decides  whether  to  stay  with  his  current  employer  at  the  wage  w (τ )  or  take  the 
outside  wage  oﬀer  v (τ ). 
•	 The  worker  produces 

αθτ 

for  some  α >  2c.  This  production  level  is  regardless  of  the  identity  of  the  employer  (since 
training  is  general). 

(a)  Deﬁne  a  pure  strategy  Perfect  Bayesian  Equilibrium  (PBE)  of  this  game. 
(b)  Show  that  the  unique  PBE  involves  the  worker  always  staying  with  the  initial  employer  and 
the  initial  employer  providing  training.  Describe  the  strategies  that  support  this  equilibrium 
outcome. 
(c)  Characterize  the  equilibrium  wage  in  the  initial  period, W .

(d)  Relate your ﬁndings in part (b) to the result that ﬁrm-sponsored general training investments 
are possible if and only if there are labor market imperfections and wage compression.  Explain 
this  result  and  show  whether  your  ﬁnding  here  ﬁts  with  this  result  (if  not,  explain  why  not; 
if  yes,  show  in  what  sense  there  is  wage  compression  here). 
(e)  How would you modify it to make it more attractive theoretically or more realistic empirically? 
(Please  be  brief.) 

4.  (NEW  BLUE  BOOK)  Consider  an  economy  consisting  of  a  large  number  of  workers  and  ﬁrms. 
Each  worker  is  inﬁnitely  lived  in  discrete  time  and  maximizes  the  expected  discounted  value  of 
income,  with  a  discount  factor  β < 1.  There  is  no  ex  ante  heterogeneity  among  the  workers,  but 
the quality of the match between a worker and its employer is random, and is not directly observed 
by  either.  Suppose  that  the  worker  is  a  good  match  to  its  employer  with  probability  µ0  ∈  (0, 1). 
A worker who  is  a  good match  to  its  employer  produces  output  yh  with  probability  p  and  output 
yl  < yh  with probability 1 − p.  A worker who  is not a good match to  its employer always produces 
yl .  Let µ be  the posterior probability  that  the worker  is  a  good match  and  suppose  that  the wage 
of  the  worker  as  a  function  of  this  posterior  is  given  by 
w (µ) = φ [µyh  + (1 − µ) yl ] , 
where φ ∈ (0, 1].  At any point in time, the worker can decide to quit and immediately ﬁnd another 
job,  but  in  the  process  pays  a  “mobility”  cost  equal  to  γ . 

(a)  Determine  how  beliefs  about  worker-ﬁrm match  quality  evolve  over  time. 
(b)  Write  down  a  Bellman  equation  describing  the  value  of  a  worker  with  belief  µ.  Specify  when 
the  worker  will  quit  her  job. 
(c)  Show  that  workers  that  quit  will  experience  a  wage  gain. 
(d)  Show  that  a  worker  who  is  a  good  match  may  initially  experience  wage  decline,  but  will  on 
average  experience  wage  growth.  Show  that  there  exists  T <  ∞  such  that  a  worker  who  is 
a  good  match  and  remains  with  its  employer  for  more  than  T  periods  will  have  a  constant 
wage. 
(e)  Describe  what  features  in  the  data  are  successfully  accounted  for  by  this model.  What  other 
features  about  job  changes  and  wage  growth  cannot  be  accounted  for  by  this  model?
