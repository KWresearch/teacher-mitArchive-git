1.  A  consumer  chooses  between  two  goods,	 x1  and  x2 ,  with  prices  p1  and  p2 ,  given  income  y ,  so  as  to 
maximize  utility. 

(a)  Graph  the  consumer’s  problem  in  x1  and  x2  space.  Show  the  consumer’s  optimal  choice. 
(b)  Give  a  graphical  decomposition  of  the  income  and  substitution  eﬀects  from  a  change  in  p1  on  the 
demand  for  x1 . 

2.  Assume  the  consumer’s  utility  function  is  given  by: 
u (x1 , x2 ) = α ln (x1  − γ 1 ) + (1 − α) ln (x2  − γ 2 ) , 
where:  0 ≤ α ≤ 1,  x1  > γ 1  ≥ 0,  x2  > γ 2  ≥ 0. 

(This  is  called  a  Stone-Geary  utility  function.  The  parameters  γ 1  and  γ 2  are  sometimes  thought  of  as

“subsistence”  levels  of  consumption,  below  which  utility  is  not  deﬁned.)


(a)  What  is  the marginal  rate  of  substitution  (MRS)  for  this  utility  function? 
(b)  Present the ﬁrst-order conditions for the optimal choices of x1  and x2  as a single equation involving 
the MRS. What  is  the  graphical  interpretation  of  this  condition? 
(c)  Derive the uncompensated (“Marshallian”) demand function for x1  for this consumer as a function 
of  p1  and  y  by  maximization.  Use  Roy’s  identity  to  conﬁrm  this. 
(d)  What  is  the  cost  function  for  this  problem? 
(e)  Derive  the  compensated  (“Hicksian”)  demand  function  for  x1  for  this  consumer  as  a  function  of 
p1  and  a  ﬁxed  level  of  utility,  u�  by  using  Shephard’s  lemma  and  by  a  direct  solution  of  the  cost 
minimization  problem.  What  is  the  graphical  interpretation  of  a  compensated  price  response? 
What  is  the  Slutsky  equation  for  this  problem? 
(f )  Show  that  the  consumer’s  expenditure  on  x1  is  a  linear  function  of  p1  and  y .  For  example,  for 
good  x1 ,  we  have

p1x1  = p1γ 1  + α (y − p1γ 1  − p2γ 2 ) .

For  this  reason,  the  Stone-Geary  utility  function  is  sometimes  called  the  “Linear  Expenditure 
System.”  Interpret  this  equation. 

3.  Empirical  researchers  often  work  with  the  Cobb-Douglas  production  function: 

where  L  is  labor, K  is  capital,  and  Q  is  the  quantity  of  output. 

Q = γLαK β ;  α > 0,  β > 0,  γ > 0, 

(a)  What must  be  true  for  this  production  function  to  exhibit  constant  returns  to  scale? 
(b)  Assuming  you  have  the  necessary  data,  describe  at  least  two  ways  to  construct  a  statistical  test 
for  constant  returns  to  scale  in  production. 
(c)  Suppose	 you  have  data  on  a  panel  of  ﬁrms.  Explain  how  to  use  this  data  to  control  for  an 
unobserved  but  time-invariant  variable  that  captures managerial  eﬃciency. 

4.  What  is  the  present  value  of  x  dollars/year  for  t  years  with  interest  compounded  annually?  What  is 
the  present  value  with  interest  compounded  continuously?  Suppose  a  ﬁxed  cost  of  C  paid  up  front 
yields  a  stream  of  beneﬁts  B  starting  in  10  years.  Deﬁne  the  internal  rate  of  return  for  this  pro ject. 

5.  Suppose  that  the  demand  for  internet  connect  time  is  a  linear  function  of  the  price  of  time  and  the 
annual  income  of  college  students.  Make  up  some  notation  for  a  demand  equation  that  reﬂects  this 
assumption.  Use this equation to compute the price-elasticity of demand for connect tiome as a function 
of  demand  parameters  and  price,  income,  and  quantity  sold.

6.  Regression  basics 

(a)  Omitted  variables  bias  formula:  What  is  the  relationship  between  the  regression  coeﬃcient  from 
a bivariate  regression of wages on  schooling  (a “short  regression”) and  the coeﬃcient on  schooling 
when  the  equation  also  includes  test  scores  (a  “long  regression”)?  Generalize  this  to  the  case 
where  both  the  short  and  long  models  include  other  covariates. 
(b)  Regression  anatomy:  Explain  how  to  calculate  a  multivariate  regression  coeﬃcient  using  a  two-
step  procedure  where  the  second  step  is  a  bivariate  regression. 

7.  Suppose  the  probability  a  woman  works  is  modeled  using  a  laten-index  model  such  that 
�β > εi ) , 
yi  = 1 (Xi

� 
� 
where  yi  is  employment  status,  Xi  is  a  vector  of  personal  characteristics,  and  εi  is  N  0, σ2  and 
independent  of  Xi .  Write  down  the  likelihood  function  and  show  the  FOCs.  What  is  identiﬁed? 
Propose  a  weighted  least  squares  procedure  that  is  asymptotically  equivalent  to  the MLE. 

8.  Derive the  formula  for the standard error of a diﬀerence  in means.  Show that  if the outcome variable  is 
homoskedastic, the optimal experimental design for estimating a diﬀerence in means has the proportion 
treated  equal  to  1/2.
