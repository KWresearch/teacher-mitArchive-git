***** Empirical Project *****
This project asks you to review, replicate, and extend an empirical paper from
our reading list. The paper should be one that we have not covered in detail in
class.
Your write-up should have three major components:
**** A. Review ****
   1. What questions does the study ask? Why are these questions of economic
      interest? What are the most important findings in the paper?
   2.
   3. Where does this paper fit in the relevant literature? What were the
      findings at the time the paper was written? What is the contribution of
      this particular paper? What has been done on this topic since this paper
      was published? Are the paper's findings still relevant?
   4.
   5. What data were used? Are they reliable enough for the researcher's
      purposes? Are better data available now? What would constitute an ideal
      data set?
   6.
   7. What would be an ideal research design for the question at hand? Are the
      econometric techniques used in the study sensible and do they appear to
      have been correctly implemented? What assumptions support a causal
      interpretation of the results presented in the paper? Are these
      assumptions discussed adequately? Are the results reasonably convincing
      â why or why not?
**** B. Replication ****
Identify the main findings and use the authors' data to replicate these results
if possible. If the data cannot be obtained, construct the same sort of
estimates using a data set of your choosing. Choose a data set that you would
expect to generate similar results. Summarize and compare your replication
results to the original results in a table. Discuss why you think your results
differ from the original (if they do).
**** C. Extension ****
Extend the work in some way. Do this either by (a) estimating alternative
interesting specifications that the author might have tried or that would shed
further light on the issues raised in the paper (e.g., specification checks or
subsamples of special interest), or (b) collecting new data and producing
results for this new sample. Any analysis of new data should include
specification and robustness checks of the sort you would hope to see in a
study of this nature.
A word to the wise: The product of this exercise is an essay, not unlike the
many that you will spend the rest of your life writing. So pick a style guide
and master it (Strunk and White's The Elements of Style is my favorite). A
second word: You'll spend the rest of your life writing about numbers. Strunk
and White don't discuss that and it doesn't come naturally. Learn how to do it
by imitating the good work of others.
***** Exams *****
There will be a 3-hour final exam at the end of the semester.
