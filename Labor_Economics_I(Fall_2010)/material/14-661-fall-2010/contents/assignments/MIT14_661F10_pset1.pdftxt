Labor Economics Problem  Set  1 
1.  This  problem  asks  you  to  extend  the  standard  one  person  static  labor  supply  problem  to  a  two-earner 
family.  Consider  a  family  with  the  following  utility  function: 

U  = U (cf  + cm , lf , lm ) . 

Utility  is  a  function  of  the  sum  of  goods  consumed  by  the male  and  female members  of  the  family  and 
each members  leisure.  Each person has a  time  endowment Ti  and  faces a wage wi  where  i = f , m.  The 
family  also  has  non-labor  income  y  and  faces  a  price  p  for  consumption  goods. 

(a)  What  is  the  family  budget  constraint? 
(b)  Brieﬂy state a suﬃcient condition (restriction on the utility function) for the ﬁrst-order conditions 
of the utility maximization problem to determine labor supply hi  (wf , wm , p, y) for male and female 
family members. 
(c)  Write  down  the  uncompensated  labor  supply  response  of  females  and males 

i.  to  a  change  in  female  wages 
ii.  to  a  change  in male  wages 
in terms of substitution and income eﬀects.  Call the substitution eﬀects Sij  for worker i’s response 
to  a  change  in  j ’s  wage.  What  are  the  classical  restrictions  on  the  substitution  matrix? 
(d)  Totally diﬀerentiate the labor supply functions for females and males, assuming dp = 0.  Substitute 
your  results  from  (c)  to  obtain 

dhi  = Sif dwf  + Simdwm  + Bi  [hf dwf  + hmdwm  + dy ] , 

Labor  Supply  of 
Husbands 

where Bi  = ∂hi /∂ y . Use  this equation and what you know about  the Slutsky matrix  to  show  that 
the  introduction of  a negative  income  tax must  reduce  family  earnings,  though  it need not  reduce 
both  husbands’  and  wives’  earnings. 
(e)  Describe  a  strategy  for  estimating  income  and  substitution  eﬀects  based  on  the  equation  above. 
(f )  Ashenfelter  and  Heckman  (1974)  estimate  the  coeﬃcients  Sij  and  Bi  (which  they  treat  as  ﬁxed 
parameters)  using  three-stage  least  squares.  Why  is  OLS  inappropriate  here?

Ashenfelter  &  Heckman  report  the  following  results:

restricting  Smf  = Sf m 
with  no  restrictions 
dwf 
dwm 
dwf 
dwm 
0.11 
0.106 
0.127 
0.139 
(.043) 
(.067) 
(.090) 
(.056) 
−0.081 
0.972 
1.233 
0.127 
(.385) 
(.225) 
(.273) 
(.067) 
Do these results support the classical restrictions on the Slutsky matrix?  How would you construct 
a  formal  statistical  test  of  these  restrictions? 
(g)  The  estimated  income  eﬀects  in  the  restricted  model  (not  shown  above)  are  -.102  and  -.886  for 
husbands  and  wives,  respectively.  Does  this  imply  that  leisure  is  a  normal  good? 
(h)  What are the approximate uncompensated cross eﬀects based on the unrestricted estimates?  (Use 
the  fact  that mean  hours,  actually  a  labor  force  participation  rate  in  this  study,  are  .979  for men 
and  .341  for  women.) 
(i)  Suppose  that  instead  of  a  family  utility  function,  husbands  and  wives  act  to  maximize  their  own 
utility, which may be a  function of  their  spouses’  consumption and  leisure.  How would you  set up 
the  resulting  optimization  problem?  What  does  it  mean  for  an  allocation  to  be  eﬃcient  in  this 
model? 

Wives 

2.  Children  complicate  their  parents’  labor-supply  decisions,  especially  for mothers.

(a)  Use a graph to show how women’s labor supply decisions are aﬀected by child care costs, assuming 
she  is  the  only  adult  in  the  household. 
(b)  Describe  the  impact  of  a  lump-sum  child  allowance  that  is  phased  out  as  income  or  earnings  rise. 
Compare  this  with  the  eﬀect  of  publicly-provided  child  care  for  all,  as  is  often  found  in  Europe. 
(c)  Discuss  the  ways  in  which  state-provided  out-of-home  care  might  aﬀect  children.  What  does  the 
evidence  suggest? 

3.  Life-cycle  labor  supply 

(a)  Derive	 the  λ-constant  labor  supply  and  commodity  demand  functions  for  the  Heckman  and 
MaCurdy  (1980)  utility  function.  To  simplify  notation,  use  time  subscripts  instead  of  paren­
theses.  You  can  also  assume  the  interest  rate  is  ﬁxed. 

i.  What  is  the  intertemporal  substitution  elasticity  for  this	 model?  Why  is  this  parameter 
necessarily  (i.e.,  theoretically)  positive?  How  do  wages  aﬀect  consumption?  Why? 
ii.  What  does	 this  model  predict  about  the  behavioral  response  to  the  following  sources  of 
variation  in wages:  Cross-sectional variation  associated with permanent diﬀerences  in human 
capital;  Wage  increases  generated  by  changes  in  labor  market  experience;  Transitory  shocks 
caused  by  changes  in  the macro  economy; Changes  in  after-tax wages  caused  by  a  temporary 
NIT  program;  Job  loss  at  age  50. 

(b)  Construct  a  PSID  extract  similar  to  the  one  used  by  Angrist  (1991). 	 PSID  data  are  available 
from  the  ICPSR: 

http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/cocoon/ICPSR/STUDY/07439.xml 

(use  the Wave  I  cross-year  individual  ﬁle). 

i.  Calculate  the	 grouped-data,  Analysis  of  Covariance  (ﬁxed-eﬀects),  and  OLS  estimates  of 
MaCurdry’s  (1981)  speciﬁcation  reported  by  Angrist  (1991,  Table  3).  You  should  be  able  to 
come  close  to  these  estimates  after  replicating  the  sample  selection  criteria  and  estimation 
procedures  as  best  you  can. 
ii.  What  is  the  Angrist  (1991)  interpretation  of  the  diﬀerences  in  results  across methods? 
iii.  Why  does  Card  (1994)  take  a  skeptical  view  of  the  large  positive  intertemporal  substitution 
elasticities  that  are  generated  by  the  grouped-data  estimator  in  PSID  data?  Do  bicycle 
messengers  and  cab  drivers  answer  Card’s  concerns?
