***** Course Overview *****
The aim of this course is to acquaint students with traditional topics in labor
economics and to encourage the development of independent research interests.
We will cover a systematic development of the theory of labor supply, labor
demand, and human capital. Topics include wage and employment determination,
turnover, search, immigration, unemployment, equalizing differences, and
institutions in the labor market. There will be particular emphasis on the
interaction between theoretical and empirical modeling. Prerequisites are
intermediate microeconomics and a course in econometrics.
