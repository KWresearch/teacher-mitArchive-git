Problem  Set   6 

Due:  Wednesday,  October  19  2005. 

NONCOLLABORATIVE  Problem  1. 
ants  of  min­cost   ﬂow.  

Give  eﬃcient   algorithms   for   the  following  vari­

(a)  Find  the  minimum­cost  ﬂow  sub ject   to  the  constraint   that  the  ﬂow   value  is   at

least  90%   of  the  maximum  ﬂow  value.

(b) 	 Find  the   ﬂow  that  minimizes  the  cost  of  the  ﬂow  plus  K  times   the   diﬀerence 

between the  ﬂow  value  and  the  maximum  ﬂow  value,  for   a  given   weight  K .


Problem  2. 

Cost­scaling  algorithm  for  minimum­cost  ﬂow. 

(a)  Suppose  that  you   have   an  optimal  solution   to  some  integral  minimum­cost  cir­

culation  problem,   along   with   the  feasible  prices  that   produce  only  nonnegative

reduced  cost  arcs.   Now  suppose  that   you  then  change  one  edge  cost   by  one  unit.

Show  how  you  can  re­optimize  the   solution  using  a  max­ﬂow   algorithm.  Hint:

given  the  reduced  costs,   what  can   go  wrong  from  the  change,  and   what   kind  of

edges  can  be  involved  in  the   repair?

(b)	 Deduce  a  cost­scaling   algorithm  for  minimum­cost   ﬂow   that   makes   O(m   log  C )

calls  to  your  solution  to  part  (a).

OPTIONAL  (c)	 Design  a  cost­scaling  algorithm  for   minimum­cost   ﬂow  that  makes

O(n  log  C )  calls  to   your  solution  to  part   (a).


Note:  The  resulting   time   bounds  are  worse  than   the  capacity­scaling   algorithm   we  saw 
in  lecture,  but  a   more  careful  algorithm  along  these  lines  attains   a  better  time  bound  of  
O(mn  log  log  U  logn  C ). 

You  are  given  a   polytope  deﬁned  by  a  collection  of  inequalities  Ax  ≤  b,  and 
Problem  3. 
want  to   determine  the  largest  ball   that   will  ﬁt  inside  the  polytope.  Show   how  this   can  be 
done  by  writing   a  linear  program   to  identify  the  center   of  that  ball. 

Problem  4. 
You  have  been  chosen  to  assign  the  new  graduate  students  to  oﬃce  spaces, 
and   want  to  beneﬁt  from   the  experience.  Oﬃce  i  has  ni  available  desks,  and   graduate   student 
g  is  willing  to  pay   you  pig  dollars  for  the  privilege  of   being  placed   in   oﬃce  i.

Handout  7:  Problem  Set   4 

(a)  Show  how   you  can  use   a   min­cost   ﬂow  algorithm  to  work  out  the  best  (for   you) 

assignment  of  new   students   to   oﬃces.

(b)	 Argue  that  you  can   achieve  this  best  result  without  forcing  grad   students  to  share 

a  desk  or  split  their   time  between  multiple  rooms.

(c)  Write  a   concise  linear  program  to  solve  this  problem  (assuming  it   returns  an

integral   answer).


Problem  5. 
You  work  for  the  Short­Term  Capital  Management  company  and  start   the 
day  with   D  dollars.  Your   goal  is  to  convert   them   to  Yen   through  a  series   of  currency  trades 
involving  assorted  currencies,   so   as  to  maximize  the  amount  of  Yen   you   end  up  with.  You 
� 
are  given   a  list   of  pending  orders:  client  i  is   willing  to  convert  up   to  ui  units   of  currency  ai 
into  currency  bi  at  a  rate  of  ri  (that  is,  he  will   give  you  ri  units   of  currency  bi  for  each  unit 
of  currency  ai ).  Assume  that  going  around  any  directed   cycle  of   trades, 
ri  <  1—that   is, 
there   is  no  opportunity to   make   a   proﬁt  by  arbitrage. 

(a)  Formulate  a  linear  program  for  maximizing  the  amount  of  Yen   you  have  at  the

end  of  trading. 

(b)	 Show  that  it  is  possible   to   carry  out   trades  to  achieve  the  ob jective  of  the  linear 

program,   without   ever  borrowing  currency.  (Hint:  there  is  a  sense  in  which  your 

solution  can  be  made  acyclic.) 

(c)  Show  that  there  is  a   sequence  of  trades  that   will  let  you   end   the  day  with  the 

optimum  amount   of  Yen  and  no  other   currency  except  dollars.
