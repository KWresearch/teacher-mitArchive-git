Welcome. 
•	 why study  this  course: 
–	 theoretical   elegance,   insight on   hardness   of   problems  
–	 ability to  research  in  any area  of algorithms 
–	 ability to  recognize  problems  that  arise,  apply  past  techniques,  and 
develop   new   ones  
–	 broad   sense   of   “what   is   algorithms”.   Not   deep—other   courses   follow.  
•	 Varieties   of   problems   and algorithms  
–	 numerical analysis/linear   algebra  
–	 number   theoretic.   drives   cryptography  
–	 combinatorial—focus   of   this   course.  
∗	 things   involving   permutations   (sorting),   graphs   (shortest   paths)  
and subsets   (linear   programming).  
∗	 many  optimization  problems—ﬁnd  the  best  possible  solution 
∗	 almost   always,   ﬁnitely many   solutions.   brute   force   always   works.  
we  want something  better. 
∗	 combinatorial   optimzation:   ma jor   subarea,   but   not   all   we   cover  
(vempala   course)  
–	 aspects   of   all   will   arise   in   others  
–	 some   problems/algorithms   draw   from   multiple   areas—eg comp.   geom.  
•	 For  those  who’ve  done  randomized... 
•	 course   summary   sheet  
•	 I  will  teach  fast.  Slow  me  down  with  questions.
