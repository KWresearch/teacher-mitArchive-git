Assignment #1 

Due Date: Session 6 

This  set  of  exercises  allows  you  to  apply  the  lessons  of  the  IS-LM  model  to  some  real-world 
cases. Please feel free to use IS-LM diagrams (as the one on this page) wherever possible.

We use this graph to show (for example) how expansionary monetary policy affects an economy. 
In  the  case  of  expansionary monetary  policy,  the LM  curve  shifts  out. The  extra  liquidity  in  the 
economy allows interest rates to fall, and investment and output to rise (see below).

Question 1: The Early 1980’s 
The  early 1980s were  an  exciting  time  for  the macroeconomy. President Reagan was  attempting 
a  tax cut  revolution while  the Federal Reserve, under Chairman Paul Volcker, was attempting  to 
control inflation. 
a.	 President  Reagan’s  tax  policies  were  a  crucial  part  of  his  economic  plan.  The  most 
important policy tool was a massive tax cut (30 percent in three years). Use an IS-LM 
diagram  to  show  how  tax  cuts  would  affect  the  economy.  Assume  that  monetary 
policy does not change in this question. 
b.	 Now  say  that  President  Reagan’s  fiscal  policies  were  expansionary  while  Volcker’s 
monetary policy was contractionary. How would these two contemporaneous policies 
be  represented  in  a  single  IS-LM  diagram?    Write  a  few  sentences  to  explain  your 
diagram.  Can  you  say  anything  definitive  about  how  output  and  interest  rates  would 
change? 

Question 2: Japan in the 1990s 
The 1990s were characterized as the “lost decade” for Japan. Growth in per-capita GDP was very 
low  as  the  economy  stagnated. As usual,  economists debated  at  length whether  Japan  should  try 
to  use  monetary  or  fiscal  policy  to  solve  its  problems.  The  IS-LM  model  played  a  key  role  in 
these debates. Remember  that  the  Japanese economy  is  in a pretty deep  recession. This question 
is about trying to understand which policy the government should use to try to pull Japan out of a 
recession.  Should  it  be  expansionary  or  contractionary?  More  crucially,  should  the  government 
use monetary policy or fiscal policy?  
a.	 To  start  thinking  about  which  policy  the  government  should  follow,  let’s  first  think 
about the situation in Japan and what the LM curve looks like for Japan. Interest rates 
were  extremely  low  in  Japan  at  this  time.  When  interest  rates  get  close  to  zero,  the 
demand  for  money  is  extremely  high  (say  close  to  infinity).  In  this  case,  what  does 
the LM  curve  look  like?  (Note  that  nominal  interest  rates  cannot  be  lower  than  zero, 
so  the  LM  curve  cannot  cross  the  horizontal  axis  of  the  IS-LM  diagram).  Draw  a 
picture of what the LM curve may look like for Japan.  
b.	 Now,  let’s  think  about  the  IS-LM  equilibrium  in  Japan. Which part of  this LM  curve 
do  you  think  the  Japanese  economy  is  in  equilibrium  at?  Indicate  this  on  your  graph 
and draw in the IS curve now to give you an equilibrium at that point.  
c.	 To  decide  whether  it  should  use  monetary  or  fiscal  policy,  let’s  think  about  what 
happens  to  the  LM  curve  when  there  is  an  injection  of  liquidity  into  the  system,  i.e. 
the  government  uses  expansionary  monetary  policy.  How  does  the  LM  curve  shift 
and  how  does  this  affect  output  and  interest  rates?  Therefore,  how  effective  a  tool  is 
monetary policy for pulling the economy out of the recession in Japan? 
d.	 Given  where  Japan  is,  is  fiscal  policy more  or  less  effective  than  the  usual  case  (i.e. 
the standard case we have talked through in class)? Can you show this with an IS-LM 
diagram? Compare the Japan case to the usual case using an IS-LM diagram for each. 
e.	 How do these findings inform the choice of policy for Japan in the 1990s?
