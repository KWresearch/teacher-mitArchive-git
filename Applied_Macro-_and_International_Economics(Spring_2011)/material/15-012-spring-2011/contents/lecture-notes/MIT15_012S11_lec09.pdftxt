Class Outline


•  Nominal exchange rates E 
– Short‐run: market for local currency 

•  Interest‐rate parity 
– Long‐run: 
•  “Law of one price” and PPP 
•  Real Exchange rates  E and Prices


Nominal Exchange Rate

Nominal Exchange Rate


•	 Exchangge Rate  keyy p price in oppen economies  effect on 
trade and financial flows 
•	 Nominal Ex. Rate = E = price of one currency in terms of 
anothther 
•	 Two ways of expressing it: 
–	 Local currency per unit of foreign currency.
Loc
al curr
ency per 
unit of foreign currency.
Eg Brazil: $5 reals per dollar (↑E deprecia(cid:415)on of local currency) 
–  MORE INTUITIVE: Foreign currency per unit of local currency. 
E  B 
)
Eg Brazil: 0.2 dollars per real (↑E is apprecia(cid:415)on of local currency)

•	 From now on, I will use the “intuitive” form… 

Reals per 1USD 	

Last year…. 
Is the Real appreciating /depreciating? 

Dollars per 1 Real


Less Reals to buy dollar….. 

Real is appreciating 

More dollars to buy real…..

What affects E? 
•	 Exports & Imports 
•	 Financial Flows

•	 Example: Brazil
Example: Brazil 

– Imports  need to buy dollars to purchase goods 
Imports  need to buy dollars to purchase goods 
abroad  supply reals 
– Exports bring dollars from abroad, need to

exchange them for reals  demand reals


– Capital Outflows (away from brazil) supply reals 
– Capital Inflow (coming to brazil)  demand reals

  1+iUS  <  (1+iBR  )*(Et+1/Et) more capital flows to Brazil ( example of “carry trade” )

Intui(cid:415)on: If ↑ PUS /P/PBR  US is expensive  Brazil cheap buy
Intui(cid:415)on: If ↑ P 
 US is expensive, Brazil cheap buy 
goods in brazil, sell in US  demand for real goes up (think 
exports) ↑ E(US$/Real)
