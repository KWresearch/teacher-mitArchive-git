***** Textbooks *****
A textbook for 6.00 is now available. The book and the course lectures parallel
each other, though there is more detail in the book about some topics. The book
is NOT required. We will not be referring to it in assignments or depending
upon it to cover holes in the lectures.
[mp_logo.gif] [Amazon_logo] Guttag, John. Introduction_to_Computation_and
Programming_Using_Python. MIT Press, 2013. ISBN: 9780262519632.
If you choose not to purchase this book, you will probably find it useful to
buy or borrow another book that covers Python. You might check your local
public library's resources, or search online for a free Python text, such as
How_to_Think_Like_a_Computer_Scientist or An_Introduction_to_Python.
Other optional textbooks:

      Computer Science. 1st ed. Franklin Beedle &amp; Associates, 2003. ISBN:
      9781887902991. (Be sure to get the 1st edition, not the 2nd.)
    * [Amazon_logo] Budd, Timothy. Exploring Python. McGraw-Hill Science, 2009.
      ISBN: 9780073523378.
    * Shaw, Zed A. Learn_Python_the_Hard_Way. (Available to read on the web for
      free. Also available as PDF_download,_ePub_download,_or_printed_book
      mailed to you, each at a low cost.
    * Swaroop, CH. A_Byte_of_Python.
    * Dive_into_Python by Mark Pilgrim
    * Code_Like_a_Pythonista:_Idiomatic_Python by David Goodger
    * The Python_Programming_Wikibook is not too bad. This is a work in
      progress, often minimal.

information, including animated images showing you what nodes are chosen. Once
you understand how both algorithms work, try writing out the order nodes are
visited in another graph using both BFS and DFS.
