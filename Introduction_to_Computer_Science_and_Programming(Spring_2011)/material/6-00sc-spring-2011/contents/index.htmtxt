***** Course Description *****
This subject is aimed at students with little or no programming experience. It
aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play
in solving problems. It also aims to help students, regardless of their major,
to feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that
allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class will use the Python
programming language.
