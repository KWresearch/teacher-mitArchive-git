Unit 2 begins with hash functions, which are useful for mapping large data
sets. We will continue with a broad introduction to object-oriented programming
languages (Python is an example), covering objects, classes, subclasses,
abstract data types, exceptions, and inheritance. Other algorithmic concepts
covered are "Big O notation," divide and conquer, merge sort, orders of growth,
and amortized analysis.
The next several lectures introduce effective problem-solving methods which
rely on probability, statistical thinking, and simulations to solve both random
and non-random problems. A background in probability is not assumed, and we
will briefly cover basic concepts such as probability distributions, standard
deviation, coefficient of variation, confidence intervals, linear regression,
standard error, and plotting techniques. This will include an introduction to
curve fitting, and we introduce the Python libraries numpy and pylab to add
tools to create simulations, graphs, and predictive models.
We will spend some time on random walks and Monte Carlo simulations, a very
powerful class of algorithms which invoke random sampling to model and compute
mathematical or physical systems. The Monty Hall problem is used as an example
of how to use simulations, and the knapsack problem introduces our discussion
of optimization. Finally, we will begin looking at supervised and unsupervised
machine learning, and then turn to data clustering.
At the end of Unit 2 there will be an exam covering all material (lectures,
recitations, and problem sets) from the beginning of the course through More
Optimization_and_Clustering.
