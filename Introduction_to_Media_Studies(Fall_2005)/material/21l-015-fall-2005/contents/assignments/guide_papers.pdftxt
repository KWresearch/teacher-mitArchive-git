Guidelines for Papers  
 
Papers should be typewritten, double-spaced (12-pt. Times font preferred) with name, date, course 
number/name, and title (no cover page necessary). 
 
A good paper will have: 
 
 1   a clearly defined topic AND argument: Your essay should stake out a claim about one or another aspect 
of media. Your topic should be expressed in a clear thesis sentence, which I would like to see printed at 
the top of the paper. Your topic should be something that is open to dispute, that is, not a factual 
statement (i.e. Thomas Edison invented the light bulb) and not a statement of opinion (i.e I hate Thomas 
Edison), but an interpretive or argumentative proposition (i.e Thomas Edison's Laboratory provided the 
model for the contemporary think tank; or, Thomas Edison's inventions fit within a larger pattern of 
technological innovation in the late 19th century; or Thomas Edison promoted his light bulb through 
images that fit within the larger tradition of "technological utopianism" in American thought.) 

 
 2   a direct relationship to one or another of the readings or lectures: Ideally, your first paragraph will 
describe one or another claim made in the readings and then develop your thesis in relation to it. You 
want to make sure that you clearly understand what the writer is arguing. You want to summarize and 
quote the argument directly. You want to make sure that you are focusing on a salient point in the 
argument, not a throwaway detail. You want to make sure that this claim by the writer is relevant to the 
argument you want to make. You may draw on the author elsewhere in the paper as well, and probably 
should, but I want to make sure that from the start, your paper is engaging with the course concepts and 
materials. 

 
 3   an organizational structure which allows you to develop your ideas in a systematic and logical fashion: 
Often, MIT students write their papers stream of consciousness style, finding their thesis somewhere 
near the end of the process, and turning it in. In an age of word processors, you have no real excuse for 
not shuffling around paragraphs, once you find your thesis, so that it structures and guides your 
argument throughout. You also don't have an excuse for not rethinking your key propositions if need be 
once you figure out what your paper is about. In an ideal world, of course, you would think through the 
essay and outline it before you start writing. 

 
 4   clear support for each major proposition you make: Think of a simple and basic formula. For every claim, 
1-3 concrete bits of evidence (quotes from the reading, facts, relevant stories, etc. which illustrate your 
main ideas). For every example, some analysis which shows why it is relevant to the case you are trying 
to make. 

 
 5   a clear conclusion which puts the whole into perspective and tells us why what you are arguing matters: 
This is the part students at MIT often miss. They sometimes see the exercise as one of describing some 
aspect of contemporary media, often in the breathless prose we come to expect from corporate 
prospectuses or WIRED magazine reports. And, then, they end without putting it into some larger social 
or cultural context. Remember this is a humanities course even if we are talking a lot about 
technologies. We still want to know the human consequences of media. So, as you write, imagine that I 
am sitting over your shoulder and every time you finish a paragraph, I look down at you sneeringly and 
say, "SO WHAT!" You had better be able to answer that SO WHAT question and if you can't, you 
haven't thought through your subject enough.
