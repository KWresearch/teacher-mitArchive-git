Three Takes at the War in Iraq  [excerpts from WEB sources] 

1. Sadam’s longstanding efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction reveal the 
fundamental nature of his threat to America.  Where others might eventually tire, he will 
never give up the effort.  Once he has these weapons America will confront an 
undeterrable danger. 
Sadam Hussein is a second-rate, second-priority despot worth taking out. Presidents and 
politicians of both parties have likened the Iraqi dictator to Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin. 
Small wonder the public perceives Bush as more concerned about dethroning Hussein 
than disarming him. 
The president's father, after building up Hussein as an international ogre, called the U.S. 
military off when the Iraqi despot's days seemed numbered. But Sadam remained in 
power. This outcome fed voters' sense of a Bush failure. Since then, the Republican 
presidential victory in 2000 has not only restored a Bush to the White House but has also 
brought back the GOP war-management teams of 1974-75 (the end of fighting in 
Vietnam) and 1990-91 (the Gulf War). Their hunger to finish the job must be almost 
palpable. 
The return of defense secretaries and White House chiefs of staff from previous wartime 
periods is just as unprecedented. It suggests a rare combination of unrequited frustrations 
and motivations. Consider: In spring 1975, when the war in Vietnam ended with the fall 
of South Vietnam to the communists and Cambodians seized the U.S. merchant ship 
Mayaguez, Donald H. Rumsfeld, now Defense secretary, was the White House chief of 
staff and Dick Cheney, now vice president, was his deputy.

2. Control of global oil has been the prime U.S. national security interest since World 
War II.  One need only look at the extensive U.S. involvement in the Middle East during 
the cold war to realize that oil, not free nations, was the driving force. 
An NSC document released recently on 60 Minutes' told a vast audience that the attack 
on Iraq was not about national security in the wake of 9/ll. It was not about weapons of 
mass destruction. It was not about Saddam Hussein's possible ties to Osama bin Laden. It 
was about stealing Iraq's oil, same way the British stole it three quarter of a century 
earlier. The major oil companies drew up the map, handed it to their man George, helped 
him (through such trusties as James Baker) steal the 2000 election and then told him to 
get on with the attack. 
3. The buzz in Washington and beyond has been that President Bush's attack on Iraq 
came straight from the playbook of the neoconservatives, a group of mostly Republican 
strategists, many of whom have gotten funding from Milwaukee's Bradley Foundation. 
The neoconservatives differ from traditional conservatives in favoring a more activist 
role for government and a more aggressive foreign policy. 
Led by Weekly Standard editor William Kristol, the neoconservatives have offered a 
sweeping new vision for U.S. foreign policy: to restructure the Middle East and supplant 
dictators around the world, using pre-emptive attacks when necessary against any 
countries seen as potential threats.  Taking advantage of America’s hegemony in the post-
Cold War world they are intent on using America’s power to advance American ideals --  
spreading democracy through the barrel of a gun.
