***** Assignment 1 *****
   1. Read the excerpts below. For each of the excerpts:

      (a) Compose a one paragraph argument (no more than several sentences)
      that reflects the underlying thrust of the explanation for the U.S.
      invasion of Iraq.
      (b) Restate this argument as an empirical generalization that could be
      used in studying a larger number of cases of U.S. intervention.
      (c) For each answer in (b), describe at least four plausible observable
      implications.
      (d) Do this exercise with reference to King, et al., section 3.5.
   2. Next repeat (a) through (c) for your own area of research. Compose an
      argument, its corresponding empirical generalization, and delineate the
      plausible observable implications of the latter in a manner that could be
      the basis for an empirical investigation.

***** Assignment 2 *****
Read the Bentacur study on gentrification:
Betancur, John J. "The Politics of Gentrification." Urban Affairs Review 37,
no. 6 (July 2002): 780-814.
Identify at least six possible threats to validity (plausible rival
explanations) in that study. Describe how each threat you identify could arise
and how a change in the research design might mitigate that threat. [Three
paragraphs on each plausible rival explanation should be sufficient.]
***** Assignment 3 *****
Choose a single case study in your area of interest. (It can be your own
research study)
   1. State the core argument (3 sentences maximum)
   2. State the null hypothesis (3 sentences maximum)
   3. Diagram the individual steps in the "decision process" that link cause
      and effect in the argument. That is, do a process trace. [Your null
      hypothesis may require a separate process trace diagram]. Then derive the
      possible "observables implications" for each of those steps in the
      process trace. What data would you have to collect to assess those
      observable implications? What are there observable implications that
      discriminate the study and null arguments?
