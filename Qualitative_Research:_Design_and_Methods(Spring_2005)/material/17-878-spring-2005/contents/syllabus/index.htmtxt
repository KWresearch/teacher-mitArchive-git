***** Course Objectives and Scope *****
This course begins with the premise [paraphrasing Donald Campbell] that the
fundamental goal of methodology is to rule out plausible rival hypotheses -
- caused by defective research designs -- that make our research findings
ambiguous and tentative. Accordingly, this seminar explores the development and
application of qualitative research designs and methods for the analysis. We
develop practical tools for improving validity, reliability, and inference in
research where the number of observations, cases, subjects, etc. is small
compared to that commonly encountered in quantitative studies.
This course focuses on methods for ensuring that collected data allow the
researcher to answer the questions posed by the research agenda, where mistakes
in data collection can lead to false inferences in data analysis.
The goal of the course is two-fold:
   1. To enable students to evaluate and critique studies employing qualitative
      methods and
   2. To provide students with the skills to create rigorous qualitative
      designs to guide their own research.
The seminar examines substantive examples from American politics, public
policy, comparative politics, and international relations.
***** Seminar Requirements *****
   1. The course will be structured as a seminar. This places a substantial
      burden on students to come to the sessions prepared to discuss the
      readings and to actually discuss the topics for the day. All readings
      assignments relevant to a given week's class discussion must be read
      prior to that class.

      Active and creative participation in class discussion is an essential
      part of the seminar. Students will be responsible for the assigned
      readings, for taking part in class discussions, and for leading the class
      discussion. (40%)
   2. Students will write three 1000 word analytic papers that apply an
      assigned set of analytic tools to a recently published work of political
      science (assigned by the instructors). (60%)
