NUBUS LABORATORY KIT  

For your pleasure and convenience, we have provided a portable, self-contained 
laboratory kit for each and every 6.111 student. This kit contains everything you will 
need to build that digital circuit you've always dreamed of.  

Breadboarding Modules:  

There are six proto strip modules for mounting integrated circuits and other components. 
Each group of five (or four) contacts (running left to right) is internally bussed together, 
and every group is independent from every other.  

The contacts on all proto strips accept leads from 0.015'' (AWG 26) to 0.032'' (AWG 20). 
However, they work best with AWG 22 wire; smaller diameter wires have a tendency to 
fall out. The spring loaded contacts may be damaged if you attempt to insert wire of 
larger diameter, so don't do it. Do NOT attempt to use wire larger than AWG 20. If you 
need to use a component with a larger wire, then solder a short piece of AWG 22 wire to 
it. Help is available at the Instrument Room desk.  

The left hand proto strip is specifically designed for analog circuits. Immediately to its 
left is a distribution strip for +12 volts and -12 volts. Immediately to its right is a 
distribution strip for GND and +5 volts ANALOG. There is a separate AC power switch 
for these analog power supplies. Normally, when not using this proto strip, you should 
leave this AC power switch OFF.  

Immediately to the right of the right hand five proto strips is a distribution strip for GND 
and +5 volts (DIGITAL). Note that the +5 volts (DIGITAL) and the +5 volts (ANALOG) 
are NOT connected. Do NOT connect these two +5 volt power supplies together. All 
power supply busses run vertically down the side of each strip.  

Integrated circuits are installed on the center of a strip, leaving three or four contacts for 
each IC pin. Note that two of the five proto strips are narrower than the other three. 
Please keep this in mind when planning the location of ICs. Jumper wires, cut to the 
desired length from # 22 wire, are installed whenever needed. 3/8" of insulation should 
be stripped away from the wire for insertion into a contact.  

Resistors, capacitors, and diodes may be placed where needed. When inserting 
components, especially integrated circuits, be careful not to break the pins. The pins of 
new integrated circuits will usually be fanned out slightly, making insertion difficult. 

Bend the pins carefully to make them perpendicular to the body of the IC by pressing the 
IC against a table top so that the IC fits easily in place.  

There are three proto strips labeled with the ``3M'' logo. The two vertical ones are bussed 
together on the printed circuit board and also connected to three connectors at the lower 
right and to two larger connectors at the right hand side of the kit. The signals on these 
two ``3M'' strips are identical EXCEPT for the top three connections. Labels on the pc 
board are supplied which correspond to signals required for the HP logic analyzer 
termination adapters. Note that these do NOT correspond to actual pin numbers on 
connectors L1, L2, and L3.  

Ribbon cables are available for interconnecting kits via the two 50 pin connectors K1 and 
K2 on the right hand side of the kit. All of the even numbered pins on K1 and K2 are 
grounded. The wiring for connectors K1 and K2 is given in the following table.

Power supplies:  

The kit contains internal regulated power supplies for three voltages bussed to the power 
distribution proto strips. The +5 volt DIGITAL supply is a switcher rated at 8 amperes, 
and is used for powering digital IC's and the indicator lights. A linear power supply is 
used to provide the +12 volts and -12 volts for ANALOG circuits and the +5A ANALOG 
supply is provided by a separate voltage regulator powered by the +12 volt supply. The 
+12 and -12 volt supply is rated at 1.5 amperes. The +5A supply can supply about 1 
ampere, but bear in mind that any current supplied by the +5A supply comes from the 
+12 volt supply. A separate (soldered) fuse2 is provided for the +5A supply on the upper 
left corner of the pc board. It is best to reserve the +5A supply for analog parts even if 
you use the left hand proto strip for digital parts.  

Switching power supplies generate RF noise. Low level analog circuits can be tested with 
the digital power supply turned off.  

These internal power supplies can be damaged by wiring errors. Before turning on power, 
double check your wiring to make sure that no short circuits exist between any of the 
power busses. Unless you are using special components that require +/-12 volts, there 
should be no connection at all to these busses. These voltages will DESTROY 5 volt 
digital IC's such as the 74LSXX series in your kit. Double check the power supply 
connections to each chip before turning on the power. Reversed +5 and ground 
connections will most likely destroy the IC's. You should turn off the +/- 12 volt supplies 
(using the separate AC switch on the lower left) when they are not being used.  

Nubus:  

The upper ``3M'' proto strip provides access to a Nubus. The Nubus was originally 
provided as a possible way to add new capabilities. It has never been used as such. When 
not using the Nubus protocol, the following pins on the upper 3M proto strip should be 
left open:  

/RESET  

/1D0  

/1D1  

/1D2  

/1D3  

/TM0  

/TM1  

/PFW  

/ACK  

/START  

/RQST  

/NMRQ  

/ARB0  

/ARB1  

/ARB2  

/ARB3  

Without a terminator card installed underneath the proto strip PC board (the normal 
configuration for 6.111) the ``Nubus'' can be used for other purposes. Instead the CPLD 
and FPGA boards can drive AD0-31. See their separate write-ups. The switches and HEX 
LED display can be accessed by reading or writing to location 0xF3000000 when the 
switches and lights board is installed in slot 3 which is the normal position. When not 
using the Nubus protocol (the normal situation for 6.111) the signal ``NUHEX'' should be 
grounded. When using another board via the NUBUS (ADxx), NUSW should be left 

open. Beware of grounding NUSW if CPLD or FPGA boards drive any of the pins 
AD16-31. Avoid contention. Leave NUSW open. NUSW could be grounded to enable 
the switches to drive the right 16 NUBUS pins (AD 16-31). These signals are located at 
pins 1 and 3 (pin 2 is conveniently GND) of the left hand ``3M'' vertical proto strip.  

A standard Nubus clock which has a 25% duty cycle and a frequency of 10 MHz is 
provided. It is labeled /CLK and is located at the right hand end of the horizontal ``3M'' 
proto strip.  

HEX LED Display:  

An eight digit HEX LED display is provided. This can be accessed by a Nubus write 
transaction as mentioned above. Alternately, when the signal NUHEX is grounded, the 
32 bit register that drives this display can be loaded via the 32 lines /AD31 through /AD0 
(The LSB, /AD0 is the right hand bit). The high and low half-words (16 bits each) are 
clocked respectively by the signals /HHEX and /LHEX which are located at the left hand 
side of the horizontal ``3M'' proto strip. When not using the Nubus, it is convenient to 
wire /CLK to both the /HHEX and /LHEX so that signals wired to the /AD0-31 lines are 
immediately displayed by the HEX LEDs. Remember that the signal NUHEX must be 
grounded for the HEX LEDs to be used in this way.  

Indicator Lamps:  

There are eight LED lamps (L7-L0) which are internally wired as shown in Figure 1. See 
the labels at the upper left of the kit. When the lamp contact point is open circuited or at 
ground potential, or logic 0, the lamp is dark. When the lamp contact is at or above 
approximately 3.3 volts, current flows through the LED (with a built in resistor) and the 
lamp is lit.  

Switches:  

There are 16 SPDT (Single Pole, Double Throw) switches. Switches S31-S28 (the left 
hand four) are momentary contact push button switches. Switches S27-S16 (the right 
hand twelve) are toggle switches. All switches are debounced with latches. so that 
multiple transitions are not generated when the switch position is changed. The 
pushbutton switches are wired as shown in Figure 2. The toggle switches are wired as 
shown in Figure 3. The switches can be accessed by a Nubus read transaction as 
mentioned above. The TTL outputs of the switches are always available at the upper left 
of the kit as labeled on the PC board. Note that the push button switches have both TRUE 
and COMPLEMENT outputs available.  

Tools:  

Wire cutters, wire strippers, needle-nose pliers, IC extractor, and a logic probe are 
included.  

Components:  

A variety of discrete components are available in the lab. Integrated circuits are supplied 
on a conducting foam carrier with an associated map of their locations. Please replace ICs 
according to the map to make it easy to find ICs and to facilitate re-stocking. These 
components will satisfy nearly all of your circuit requirements for the assigned labs in 
6.111.  
Bypass Capacitors:  

Large current spikes result when the outputs of digital IC's change state. The effect of 
these spikes can be ameliorated by placing a medium-value capacitor between +5 and 
ground in close physical proximity to the IC's. This bypass capacitor acts like a local 
reservoir for the transient current. The bypass capacitor needs to be physically close to 
the chip because of the inductance associated with the breadboard strip busses. Each 
power supply distribution strip is bypassed with a .1 micro-farad capacitor at the top and 
bottom. This should provide sufficient bypassing, but in case of suspected problems, you 
may want to add another 0.1 micro-farad bypass capacitor in the middle of each power 
strip.  

Wire:  

Number 22 solid conductor wire is available in the lab.  

We recommend using RED wire for +5 volts, BLACK wire for GROUND, and other 
colors for signals.  

Wiring Circuits:  

Neatness and orderliness in wiring circuits are extremely important. We really don't 
expect you to believe this at first. Many students before you have learned this lesson the 
hard way. They have wired in a sloppy manner and have not been able to get their circuit 
to work until they ripped out the original wiring and re-did it neatly. A photo of a second 
wiring of part of a project is shown on page A-1. You should follow its style in wiring 
your circuits.  

Static:  

MOS IC's are particularly susceptible to damage by static discharges. Please be careful to 
ground yourself before touching the IC. Keep the IC's in conductive (black) foam.  

Integrated Circuit Pin Assignments:  

Pin connection data for most IC's supplied in the 6.111 kit follows. For electrical and 
other information, refer to the TTL Data Book by Texas Instruments, Inc. It is your 
primary source of information for understanding the electrical and logical characteristics 

of the ICs. You should read the data sheet carefully before using a given IC for the first 
time. Data is not included for:  

•  AD558 D to A converter  
•  AD670 A to D converter  
•  28F256A 32K x 8 Flash PROM  
•  6264 8K x 8 SRAM  
•  20V8 PAL  
•  22V10 PAL  

 
 
Supplements will be issued on these integrated circuits just before you need to use them. 
PLEASE DO NOT USE THEM UNTIL YOU RECEIVE THE SUPPLEMENT. They are 
expensive components, which can be easily damaged if not used properly.  

Crystal Oscillators:  

The crystal oscillators supplied can be easily DESTROYED if the power wiring is 
reversed by plugging it in UPSIDE DOWN. Please be careful as we lose a number of 
these every term! Also note that the output is rated for only 1 TTL load.  

CPLD and FPGA Boards:  

CPLD and FPGA boards can drive AD0-31. Avoid contention. Read their separate write-
ups before using them.
