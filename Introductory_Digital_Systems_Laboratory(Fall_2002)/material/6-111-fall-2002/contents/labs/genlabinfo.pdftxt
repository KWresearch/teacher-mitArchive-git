6.111 -- Introductory Digital Systems Laboratory  

General Laboratory Information  

Each student will be issued his/her own Nubus Laboratory Kit, logic probe and 
oscilloscope probes. This kit contains most of the components for the assigned laboratory 
exercises. While wiring and some debugging can be done at home, most exercises require 
the use of an oscilloscope, logic analyzer, and other special equipment not included in the 
kit. In the Digital Systems Laboratory you will find logic analyzers with dual trace 
sampling oscilloscopes and the special equipment needed for the lab exercises. The lab 
will be open for 2 hour 45 minute through week days, 5 hour 45 minute on Saturday, and 
11 hour 45 minute on Sunday. These times are subject to change and the lab will be 
closed on some holidays. Actual opening times will be posted in the lab far enough ahead 
so that you can make plans. The lab will not be staffed by Teaching Assistants (TAs) or 
Lab Aides (LAs) all of the open hours. The schedule of TAs and LAs will be available on 
the course web pages.  

PUT YOUR NAME ON ANYTHING THAT YOU BUILD IN THE 
LABORATORY AND LEAVE UNATTENDED. OTHERWISE, IT 
MAY BE GONE WHEN YOU RETURN.  

It is important to remember that you will be working with a variety of sophisticated 
equipment, including computers. Sometimes this equipment doesn't work. You should 
anticipate the possibility that the computer systems will be ``down'' at precisely the 
wrong moment, and should give yourself enough extra time to accommodate equipment 
outages.  

You should also remember to back up all of your important files. In 6.111 you will have 
the opportunity of keeping critical files both on sunpals and in your ATHENA locker. Do 
so. We will be generally unsympathetic to an excuse (for a late assignment) that involves 
a file being lost or erased.  

Additional equipment may be obtained from the Digital Instrument Room  for 12 hour 
throughout weekdays. During other hours some, but not all, of this equipment is available 
from the fifth floor instrument room.  

NOTE: You must read the EECS safety policy and sign the acknowledgment form before 
signing out your lab kit or doing any work in the lab.  

MEASURING INSTRUMENTS  
In this subject, you will design, build, and test a variety of digital systems. Virtually ALL 
newly built digital systems of even moderate complexity do NOT work the very first 

time. Even if you were to be that lucky or careful, you would still find it necessary to use 
some measuring instrument in order to verify the functionality of your digital system.  

Many digital systems will have sound or video (TV displays) output. Even if these appear 
to be correct, it is still necessary to perform a careful check of subsystems. Few of us 
would accept an airplane simply because it flew! At the very least, we would want 
someone to verify that the engines are bolted on securely. Likely we would want several 
other checks to be made before we flew in it.  

We have provided a variety of measuring instruments. In your lab kit there are LEDs 
which can be used to observe the state of slowly varying signals. There is also a logic 
probe which is convenient to carry and with which you can determine the state of slowly 
varying signals and even detect whether signals are pulsing or not. There has been 
considerable debate as to the wisdom of providing you with a logic probe. They are 
handy and useful in some circumstances, e.g., in your room. However, the logic probe is 
rarely the instrument of choice in the laboratory.  

In the laboratory, we have multi-channel logic analyzers available which also include a 
two-channel high-speed digital oscilloscope. These measuring instruments can provide 
you with a substantial amount of information, which is useful for the debugging, and 
testing of your digital systems.  

The oscilloscope displays an analog waveform and is useful for verifying that your digital 
signal is indeed a binary signal. If you miswire your circuit and happen to connect two 
outputs together, you will easily see that the resulting signal is not a logic one or zero but 
somewhere in between. An oscilloscope is also quite useful for measuring short time 
intervals.  

One of the chief benefits of logic analyzers is that you have many channels available and 
thus you can see many signals at the same time. Logic analyzers can be used in two 
modes. As a timing analyzer, they are similar to an oscilloscope. However their display is 
quantized in both voltage level (one or zero) and in timing resolution (ten or twenty 
nanoseconds). When used as a state analyzer, the signals are sampled with your system 
clock and provide you with a compact display of many signals at the times when they 
really matter. This is very desirable IF your signals are indeed well behaved digital 
signals.  

The primary purpose of the first laboratory exercise is to provide you an opportunity to 
learn how to use these measuring instruments and also how to program a PAL. You will 
then put these skills to the test in labs two and three and your final project.
