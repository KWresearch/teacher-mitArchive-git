Project Resources  

Project resources are allocated on a per student basis. This means that a two-person 
project has twice the resources that an individual project has, etc. You have already been 
issued a kit and a quantity of ICs. The following items are available on an individual 
sign-out basis. Note that the quantities listed must suffice for the entire class.  

200 

Quantity  Item 
Proto-boards which do not have switches, lights, or 
power supplies. Suitable 5 volt power supplies are 
mounted on the lab benches. Each proto-board will 
hold about one-half the number of ICs that can be 
mounted on your kit. 
50 pin 3M ribbon cables for kit to kit connections
