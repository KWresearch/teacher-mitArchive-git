Uses of Op Amps 

Analog uses employ negative feedback to drive + input to
(nearly) the same potential as the - input

Bias Currents 

Many Op-Amps have bipolar inputs 
Emitter coupled transistor pair 
High differential gain
But sum of input currents = Ie/Î² 

2 * Ie 

Many Op-Amps have FET inputs 
Bias currents are very small 

Slew Rate 

Is related to frequency response

Summing Junction 

If V+ is at zero potential, so is V- (assuming negative feedback) 
Output voltage is proportional to sum of currents 
Currents are inversely proportional to resistances, IF voltages are the same

How to build a D/A 

AD 558 

8-Bit D/A Converter 
You will use in Lab 3

Control of AD 558 

Is relatively simple 
Remember -- This is a LATCH

Data goes through to analog when G is HIGH

Ouput can be very noisy when bits are settling

(particularly if the source is something like memory)

Output of AD 558 

Much like a Non-Inverting Operational Amplifier

Left circuit goes 0 to 2.5 volts

Right circuit goes 0 to 10 volts

Needs 12 volt power supply! 

Dual Slope 

Dual Slope Integrating A/D 
Accurate but slow 
Requires accurate integrator 
And accurate counter and clock 

Analog to Digital Conversion 

Harder than Digital to Analog 

Several Different Methods are Used: (here are three) 

Dual Slope Integration 
Uses time which can be measured accurately 
Typically very accurate but slow 
Not widely used any more 

Multiple Conversions (FLASH) 
Very fast 
Used for converting TV signals 
Difficult to make in high precision 
AD 775 

Successive Approximation 
Medium speed 
Can be economical 
AD 670 

Operation of Dual Slope 

First, Counts 
for known time 
with input voltage at input to the integrator
Then counts 
with reference voltage at input
and measures time

Voltage Reference 

Similar to other flash converters

Needs a stable reference voltage

Can handle different Ranges of voltage

defined by top and bottom of ladder


Caution is required: the ladder is fragile! 
Voltage range < 2.8 volts 
Linearity suffers if < 1.8 volts 
AV means "Analog Voltage" (supply) 
If you use this converter, get AVDD set 
BEFORE connecting to the A/D 
converter

Successive Approximation A/D
Widely used in low and medium frequency applications
(such as audio) 

Operation of Successive Approximation A/D 

Set one bit at a time

D/A generates analog voltage

Compare with input

If overshot, turn that bit on

Finishes in fixed time


AD 670 

Conversion time 10 microseconds

Internal voltage reference

Multiple input ranges

AD 670 Can Handle Multiple Input Ranges 

High Input Voltage Range
0 to 2.55 V or 
-1.28 to +1.28 V 
Strap Pins 17 and 18 to GND
Input is Pins 16 (+) and 19 (-) 

Low Input Voltage Range
0 to 255 mV or 
-128 to +128 mV 
Strap Pins 16 to 17 (+)
and 18 to 19 (-) 

Timing: Multiple Conversion Cycles 

Here is what happens if you hold R/W low 

Must wait for last conversion to finish 

Timing: Single Conversion Cycle 

Assumes /CS and /CE are LOW

Need to control these if connected to a bus!

Conversion initiated by R/W LOW pulse
