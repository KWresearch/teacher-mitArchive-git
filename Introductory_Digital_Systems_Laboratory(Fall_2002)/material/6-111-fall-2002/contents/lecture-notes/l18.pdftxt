MC6847 Display Controller 
Obsolete but useful 
All Points Addressable 
Digital System Side

MC6847 with Character ROM 

Note the hardware hack 
To get around a bug in way /HS is generated 
(The first /HS of a frame is AFTER the first row of dots) 

2


Black and White (or Green) 

Simple way of driving monitor 
Has composite sync on the video 
Adjust pot (top) so bottom of sync pulse has V=0 

3


Color Output 

Need to decode the 'chroma' outputs
Comparators on left decode 
Gates on right drive RGB 

 AM25LS32 has fast comparators 
'S38 is open collector NANDs 

4


Vertical Sync Generation 

MC6847 generates blanking but not the vertical sync pulse 
Here is one legitimate use for one-shots

LM1882 Sync Generator 

Programmable, flexible part 

6


Sync Generator: Setup 

Store timing information in registers 
Example 
256 pixels wide 
256 lines 
5 MHZ clock (probably not typical) 

7


Sync Generator: Register Contents 


8


Sync Generator: Physical Setup 

LM1882 must be loaded on power up 
Use a ROM (PROM) to hold configuration 
Your MCU or FSM must do the programming 

9


Sync Generator: Timing of Config 

This is "Manual Addressing" mode 
See data sheet for more 

10


Sync Separator 

Reverse Direction 
Generate Composite Sync from Video 
Generate separated sync signals too 

11


Getting Information Here to

Full Handshake: Timing 
No info  gets lost 

Parallel Interface, 
Full Handshake 

12


Serial Interface 

RS-232 is a serial interface standard 
What is shown here is TTL signal 
RS-232  levels are inverted from this 

13


UART 

Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter 
Increasingly less common devices 
Example is the AY-3-1015D (now obsolete but useful) 

14


AY-3-1015D Transmit Section 


15


Transmission  Lines 

Signals travel on wires 
Attenuation -- losses 
Reflections -- affected by terminations 

16


Signal Propagation 

Pulses traveling on the line 
Voltage and Current 
Ratio of voltage to current is 'characteristic impedance' 
Sign of that ratio is direction of propagation 
Propagate at < C (speed of light) 

17


Pulses are absorbed if receiving end is matched 
If not matched, pulse 'reflects' 
Sign of refleced wave depends on impedance: 

18


Characteristic  Impedance Demo 

Reflections depend on terminating impedance 
Can be minimized by terminating correctly 

19


Crosstalk Demo 

Flat Ribbon Cable 
Similar to kit interconnect cables 
Wires situated next to each other 
Capacitive and inductive coupling 
Crosstalk minimized by alternating  wires 
Ground - Signal - Ground - Signal ...
