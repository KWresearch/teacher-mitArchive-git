6.111 Lecture # 17 

Vido Displays are usuall implemented by Cathode Ray Tubes 
Electron Beam os focused into a small spot on the screen 
Energy delivered to a phosphor creates a glowing dot (pixel) 

Video Diaplays 

Television and most computer displays use raster-scan: 

Beam can be moved 
rapidly in 2 dimensions 
Beam current 
determines brightness
of the spot 

Composite Frames 

The 'frame' is a single picture (snapshot) 
It is made up of many lines 
Each frame has a synchronizing pulse (Vertical Sync) 
Each line has a synchronizing pulse (Horizonatl Sync) 
Brightness is represented by positive voltage 
Horizontal and Vertical intervals both have blanking

Digital Displays 

White Dots on a Black Screen 
White is positive 
Black is a low voltage 
Sync is below black 

Sync pulse is in the middle of the blanking interval

Composite Synchronization 

Horizontal Sync coordinates lines 
Vertical Sync coordinates frames 
Similar but for time scales 
And they are superimposed on one another 
These numbers are for television like displays 

Recovery of Signals 

Composite Video has picture data and both syncs 
Video is above sync level 
Separation is easy 
Sync recovered by noting when composite is below sync level 
Horizontal sync is used directly 
Vertical sync is slower: 
Low pass filter

Square up with Schmitt Trigger


Generation of Signals 

Assume 1 bit per pixel 
This is a simple way of building a front end 
Timing about right for TV style displays 
's38 is fast open collector part

Control 

Try this display format: 
256 pixels X 192 rows 
7.16 MHz clock ==> .13966 microseconds/pixel 
Display time = 35.8 microseconds (active line) 
256 X 192 = 49,152 = 48k pixels = 6k bytes 

This control scheme would work:

Timing of Control Signals 

Frame Counters and ROM produce sync signals 
FCLK is at pixel rate 
SCLK is FCLK/4 
TVC controls picture memory access

LDSR controls loading shift register

DLD controls system access to picture memory


Generation of Sync Signals, etc. 
These are just bits in ROMs

Note that EOL (active low) causes a line count and clears dot counter

And that (EOF AND EOL) causes a clear of line counter


What would go into those ROMs

Color Displays 

Are similar to 3 black and white 
Colors Add 
Here is the schedule for an "8 Color Display" 
More colors possible with more bits 

Sync is often carried separately 
Sometimes is on the Green line

Character Displays 

Characters are fixed bit patterns 
Have the same shape 
Can appear at different places on the screen 
Letters and numbers are characters 
But other patterns can be useful 
On a 256 column X 192 row screen: 

Char Size  Rows  Columns 

Chars/Page 

8 x 16 
8 x 12 

12 
16 

32 
32 

384 
512 

(16 X 12 = 192)

Use of Characters can save video memory: 256 X 192 = 49152 dots 
= 6144 bytes 

Character Format (8 x 12 pixels) 

Row formatting not quite as simple 
But re-mapping is done easily in a PROM 

13 

15 

Character Format (8 x 16 pixels) 

Simple Formatting: 
Lower 4 bits of screen address 
indicate which row in character 
9 bits of screen address tell which character 

Video Controllers 

MC6847 is obsolete but easy to use 
Several display modes 
256 x 192 2 color (well, 1 and black) 
Other color graphics with lower resolution
