Lecture # 2 
Now some basics (This IS about digital logic...) 

Slid 


The values here (x 
and y) represent 
something like 
voltage (is it +5 
volts (1) or zero 
(0)? Or is a light 
ON or OFF? 

(That is, anything 
that can take on 
one of two values)

Massachusetts Stoplight Example 

F=1 implies stoplight is working correctly 

F=0 implies stoplight is busted

Obsolete Stoplight Example: Reduction using Boolean Algebra 

F = R * /Y * /G + /R * Y * /G + /R * /Y * G + R * Y * /G 

Step 1: Since Y + /Y = 1, Slide 3 
R*/Y*/G + R*Y*/G = R*(Y + /Y) * /G = R * /G 

F = R * /G + /R * Y * /G + /R * /Y * G 

Step 2: Use Absorption: R + /R * Y = R + Y 
R*/G + /R * Y * /G = (R + /R * Y) * /G = (R + Y) * /G 

F = (R + Y) * /G + /R * /Y * G = R * /G + Y * /G + /R * /Y * G 

Using Demorgan: 

/F =  ((/R * /Y) + G) * (/G + (R * Y)) = /R*/Y*/G + G * (R + Y)

Or look at the zeros: 

/F = /r*/y*/g + /r*y*g + r*/y*g + r*y*g 

Slide 3 
Which, by Demorgan (Duality) is: 

F = (/r + /y + /g)*(/r + y + g)*(r + /y + g)*(r + y + g)

if file foo.txt contains: 

a = (x + z) * (/x + y) * (z + y);

b = a ^ c; 

d = x * a; 

Slide 3


then if you do: 

reduce -b < foo.txt > foo_out.txt 

you get in foo.out: 

a = x * y + /x * z; 
/a = x * /y + /x * /z; 
b = a * /c + /a * c; 
/b = /a * /c + a * c; 
d = x * a; 
/d = /a + /x;
