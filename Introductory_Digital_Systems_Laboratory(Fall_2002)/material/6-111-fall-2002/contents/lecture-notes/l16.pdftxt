Final Project 

This is the 'Project' in 'Project Lab' 

It is YOUR design 

Work in teams of 2 or 3 persons 

Staff will support and help as possible 

Start NOW 

Most work done after lab 3 (and other work) is completed 

Demonstrations last week of term 

6.905 makes 6.111 an 18 unit subject

Procedures 

1. Form Project Teams 
Generally 2 people 
Sometimes 3 
If you want to work alone... Don't 
Experience is that it always works badly 
Teams really can get more done 
But your team should be folks you can work with 

2. Decide what to build: your project 
Should DO something 
Have some unique feature 
Be visually or aurally appealing 
(Working projects will be videotaped!) 

3. Write up Proposal Abstract 
Convenient form back of project info handout 
We will use this to map teams to project TA's 

Steps 1, 2 and 3 should be done this week (Wednesday) 

Procedures (continued) 

Procedures (continued) 

4. Write the proposal itself 
Description in words 
Block diagram of major parts 
Specifications: what will it do? 
Division of responsibilities 

5. Proposal Conference 
Schedule with your project TA 
Bring proposal material 
Expect pointed discussion 

6. Detailed Design 
Based on Proposal and Proposal Conference 
Wiring Diagrams and Source Code 
Supported by Design Conferences 
Must be done before construction begins 
Design Presentations -- scheduled at class hours 

7. Construction 
Prerequisites: everything else done 
Labs 1, 2 and 3 
All homework 
Detailed design (step 6) 

8. Demonstrate 
Typically during last week of term 
(Earlier is OK!) 
Working projects will be videotaped 

9. Report 
Class Presentation -- to be arranged 
A formal report as described in Report Guide 
Report may be prepared jointly 
Individual sections identified
