There are a variety of schemes to associate binary bits 
with numbers. 
  
The association of a binary number with an unsigned integer 
is 
straightforward.  However, one could, by your convention, 
have the 
binary point anywhere in the binary word rather than at the 
right. 
  
Negative numbers are usually represented by the two's 
complement 
scheme.  Here the left hand bit is the sign bit and the 
negative of a 
number is formed by complementing the bits and adding one.  
Ordinary 
arithmetic works and one ignores any carry (unless checking 
for 
overflow). 
  
A number of analog to digital and digital to analog 
converters use 
offset two's complement which is the same as two's 
complement with the 
left hand (sign)bit complemented. 
  
Gray codes are often used for shaft encoders, etc. so that 
a small 
amount of jitter makes a difference of only one number.  
However 
arithmetic is so difficult with Gray codes, that one 
usually converts 

gray codes to unsigned integers before doing any addition 
or 
subtraction. 
  
Floating point is a form used to realize a large dynamic 
range with a 
smaller number of bits than would be required with two's 
complement.
