These are roughly in order of applicability to 6.111 
-----------------------------------------------------------

Skahill,Kevin."VHDL for Programmable Logic". Addison-
Wesley. 
 
I used this book for 6.195 taught in the fall of 1997.  It 
is a good 
introduction to the Cypress Warp software.  It is oriented 
towards 
synthesis rather than simulation.  It includes references 
to and 
explanation of gate arrays, although Cypress, at this 
juncture, does 
not sell gate arrays.  It deals with release4 4.3.  It does 
not 
describe the current release 5.2.  6.111 emphasizes 
synthesis.  There 
are a lot of typos.  It is likely out of stock.

 Ott,Douglas.E.and Wilderotter,Thomas.J."A Designer's Guide 
to VHDL Synthesis".Kluwer Academic Publishers. 
 
This book is quite readable.  It has a number of tutorials 
at the end, 
including one using the WARP software tools.

Pellerin,David.and Taylor,Douglas."VHDL Made Easy". 
Prentice Hall. 
Quite readable, a good introduction to VHDL.

Ashendon,Peter.J."The Student's Guide to VHDL". 
 
 
Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc. 
 
San Francisco, CA 
ISBN 1-55860-520-7 
 
This book has lots of information about VHDL.  I get the 
impression 
that it is useful for those who already know how they want 
to design a 
digital system and generally how they go about organizing 
their 
design description in VHDL but do not know the details of 
VHDL.  In 
other words, it is a good book to use to find out details 
of VHDL 
constructs.  I doubt that it is a good book to start with. 
It does NOT (nor does it pretend to) deal with using VHDL 
to design 
digital systems.

Yalamanchilli,Sudhakar."VHDL Starter's Guide". 
 
 
Prentice Hall   
Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458 
ISBN 0-13-519802-X 
 
This is quite a readable book.  It has many examples used 
to present 
VHDL constructs.  It is mainly written with an eye to 
simulation 
rather than to synthesis as is the focus in this subject.  
The 
treatment of digital design ranges from the trivial to non-
existent. 
To be fair, the author states that it is aimed as a 
companion text to 

an existing text on digital design.

I have not read nor skimmed this book yet.

Ashenden,Peter.J."The Designer's Guide to VHDL" Morgan 
Kauffman 
ISBN 1-55860-270-4 
 
I have not read nor skimmed this book yet. 
However, some students have said that they got a lot from 
this book 
and that they appreciated that it treated VHDL as a 
programming 
language.

Roth,Charles.H.Jr."Digital Systems Design Using VHDL" 
 
 
PWS Publishing Company 
 
20 Parkl Plaza, Noston, MA 02116 
ISBN 0-534-95099-X 
 
 
The first chapter is a good summary of aspects of digital 
systems. 
The second chapter is a reasonable introduction to VHDL. 
The book mainly treats VHDL for simulation. 
The treatment of state machines is mostly from a 
programming viewpoint. 
It has a bunch of information on testing that seems to me 
to be 
focussed on testing an ASIC for manufacturing flaws.

IEEE Standards 
-----------------------------------------------------------
------------- 
IEEE Standard VHDL Language Reference Manual 
IEEE Std 1076-1993 
 
This defines the VHDL language.  It is in BNF form with an 
English 
description of each construct, i.e., signals. 
 
-----------------------------------------------------------
------------- 
IEEE Standard Multivalue Logic System for VHDL Model 
Interoperability 
(Std_logic_1164)  
IEEE Std 1164-1993 
 
This is primarily VHDL code which implements the 
Std_logic_1164.  It 
consists of package declaration code as well as package 
body code. 
It has a short "how to use section" at the end.  You should 
look at it 
in the library (where I think it is, anyway I have a copy) 
before you 
buy it. 
 
-----------------------------------------------------------
------------- 
IEE Standard VHDL Synthesis Packages 
IEEE Std 1076.3-1997 
 
This includes VHDL code for Numeric_Bit and 
Numeric_Standard packages. 
You should look at it in the library (where I think it is, 
anyway I 
have a copy) before you buy it.

IEEE Standards Interpretations: IEEE std 1076-1987, IEEE 
Standard VHDL 
Language Reference Manual 

IEEE Std 1076/INT-1991 
 
This is a description of problems and proposed resolutions. 
Likely, you don't want to bother reading it.
