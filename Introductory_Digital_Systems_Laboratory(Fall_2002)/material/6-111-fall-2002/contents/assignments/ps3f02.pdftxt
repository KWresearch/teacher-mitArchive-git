Problem 1:
A ﬁnite state machine shown below has one input, X, and one output, Z, and two state variables, A
and B, and a clock input.

(a) Give the state transition table for this FSM.

(b) Draw the state diagram for this FSM.

(c) Implement this FSM in VHDL.  Hand in your code and a printout of part of your simulation
showing the correct operation of the FSM.

(d) Fill in the timing diagram below. You may neglect propagation delay in the logic, assuming it
to be zero.

Problem 2:
Design a 3-bit counter that can count either up or down on the rising edge of the clock. There are
three input signals: a clock signal, a reset signal, and a signal to indicate whether the counter
should count up or count down.  If the up/down signal is high, the counter will count up, if the
input signal is low, the counter will count down.  On reset, the count will return to zero.

(a) Give the state transition table for this FSM.

(b) Use K-maps to ﬁnd the MSP expressions to be used as inputs to the D ﬂip-ﬂops.

(c) Draw the logic diagram for this counter.

Problem 3:
Using the minimum amount of logic, conﬁgure the LS163 4-bit counter to repeatedly count the
following patterns:

(a) from 1 to 9 repeatedly, i.e. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

(b) by even numbers, i.e. 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14

(c) the sequence 0,2,3,6,9,10,15
