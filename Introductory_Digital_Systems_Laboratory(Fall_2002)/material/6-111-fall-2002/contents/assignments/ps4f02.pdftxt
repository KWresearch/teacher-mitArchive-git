Problem 1: Simple Finite State Machine 
 
The sequent ial circuit below has one D flip-flop, two inputs (X and Y), and one output 
(S). The circuit consists of a full adder circuit whose carry output is connected to a D flip-
flop.

1.  Derive the truth table for the above circuit.  
2.  Draw the state diagram for this circuit (be sure to show the output S in the 
diagram).  
3.  Is the finite state machine of the Moore type or the Mealy type? Explain.  
4.  Assume that the timing characterist ics for the flip-flop are tp = tsetup = thold = 2 (cid:181)s, 
and for the full adder tp =  4 (cid:181)s. Assuming that all  inputs (X and Y) are 
synchronous with the system clock, what is the greatest clock speed at which the 
system could run?  

 
 
Problem 2: Parking Ticket Machine 
 
At Back Bay garage, Don and Larry are thinking of using an automated parking ticket 
machine to control the number of guest cars that a member can bring. The card reader 

tells the controller whether the car is a member or a guest car. Only one guest car is 
allowed per member at a discount rate only when s/he fo llows out the member at the exit 
(within the allotted time). The second guest must pay the regular parking fees. You have 
been hired to implement the control system for the machine which  is  located at the exit. 
Using your expert ise on FSMs, design the control system.

Signals from the card reader: MEMBER and GUEST 
Signals from the toll booth: TOKEN (meaning one toke received),  
 
EXP (time for discounted guest payment has 
 
 
 
expired).  
Signal to the gate: OPEN. 

 
Fee: Members are free, Guest w a Member  is 1 Token, Regular Guest is 2 Tokens.  
 

1.  Draw a truth table that corresponds to the FSM.  
2.  Draw the equivalent Karnaugh map. 
3.  Turn  in your state diagram, carefully  labeled. Be sure to indicate which state the 
FSM  is  in after a RESET.  
4.  Is this a Moore or Mealy machine?

Problem 3: VHDL Code for Bi-Directional Shift Register 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The circuit shown above  is a 4-bit bi-direct ional circular shit register with parallel  load. 
The adjacent truth table  indicates the operation state based upon the two select  lines. The 
inputs are labeled I3, I2, I1, and I0. The outputs are  labeled O3, O2, O1, and O0. This 
device  is a circular shift register. This means that when shift ing  left, bit 3 is shifted onto 
bit 0, and when shift ing right bit 0 is shifted onto bit 3.

Implement this device using VHDL. Confirm that your code compiles correctly with the 
device set to 22V10. Use the NOVA simulator to confirm that your code works correctly. 
Turn  in a  list ing of your code and  include a printout or sketch of a portion of your 
simulat ion.
