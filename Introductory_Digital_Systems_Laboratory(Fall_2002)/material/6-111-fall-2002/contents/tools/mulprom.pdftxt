l_  m is a program  useful  for  generating  PROM  files

which implements a table lookup multiplier.


The  first number, the impulse response multiplier, can be

in any of three formats, namely sign and magnitude,  two’s

complement, or all positive.  The default is seven bits of

sign and magnitude.  The second number, the signal can  be

two’s  complement  or  sign and magnitude.  The default is

eight bits of two’s complement.


One can specify the number of bits for the multiplier  and

multiplicand  and the total number of address bits for the 

PROM.  The multiplier (impulse response) is applied to the

high  order  address  bits  and  the  multiplicand (signal

value) is applied to the low order address bits.


The product is always in two’s complement format.  If  the

-2  flag is not used (see below) then the most significant

8 bits of the product are output.  If the number  of  PROM

address  bits  exceeds  the sum of the multiplier bits and

multiplicand bits, then only the low  order  part  of  the

PROM is used.


There  are  a large number of optional arguments to enable

customization of the  computed  PROM  contents. 
When  in

doubt, try a small example.

-2  Use  a  packed bytes format (see dat2ntl) where

the least significant byte of  a  two  byte  answer

precedes  the  most significant byte.  That is, the

LSB of the PROM address is used to  select  between

the  least and most significant bytes.  The default

is a single byte of precision which is left shifted

to  retain the maximum amount of precision possible
