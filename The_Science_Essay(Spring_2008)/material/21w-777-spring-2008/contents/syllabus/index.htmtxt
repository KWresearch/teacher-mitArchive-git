***** Introduction *****
In this class we celebrate, analyze, and practice the art and craft of the
science essayâthat is, humanities-style essays about science and/or the
relationship between science and technology and the rest of our lives. Drawing
on your own interests and ideas, you will write essays of substance and grace
that have science and technology as their subjects. The class's focus is on
students' own writing: a considerable part of the class will be given to
workshopping writing in small groups and as a class, and to revision of the
major essays assigned. To stimulate your thinking you'll read models of a
variety of approaches to the science essay, including works by Alan Lightman,
Oliver Sacks, Elizabeth Kolbert, Michael Pollan and others, noting in
particular how they bring scientific ideas to life for readers. Topics for
discussion will include (but not be limited to): the nature of the essay; the
challenge of explaining scientific concepts; audiences for science essays;
science in historical and cultural contexts; themes in scientific biography;
and the "non-quantifiable considerations" (Collini) that are necessarily part
of conversations about science.
The primary work of this class is to develop skill in writing clearly and
effectively, and to help students become aware of their own purposes as writers
and aware of the audience(s) they are writing for. You will write 5 essays in
response to prompts from me, with wide latitude as to subject and approach for
most assignments. Most of these essays will be short, 2-5 pages; the "long"
essay assignment will be 10-12 pages. Revision is an important component of
this class. All Essays (except Essay 1, a warm-up piece) will be revised once;
Essay 5 (the long essay) and one other essay of your choice will be polished
further.
There are no tests in this class.
This class will also have a service learning component: We will be partnering
with an honors science class at Malden High School to help them research, write
and revise an essay on the topic of "Home Science" (our Essay 2 assignment).
This project will give you a fresh way to think about how you do research for
science writing, how different audiences read your work, and to assess what
you've learned thus far about writing and revising essays.
***** Major Assignments *****
Essay assignments will be detailed in a separate document. Here's a brief
overview:
    * Essay 1 is a 2-page reading response to get your writing muscles warmed
      up.
    * Essay 2, "Home Science," is a 3-page essay on the science of something
      you encounter every day, explained for the layperson.
    * Essay 3 gives you a choice: either "Life/Science," an essay that grows
      out of your own experience, or an essay that focuses on the social impact
      of some aspect of science or technology on society (5 pages).
    * Essay 4 is a review of a book chosen from the list I will provide you (4-
      5 pages).
    * Essay 5 will be a longer essay (10-12 pages) on a topic of your choosing.
    * Oral presentations: you'll make short, informal presentations proposing
      topics for Essays 3-6. Each of you will also lead class discussion of one
      of our readings.
***** Course Meeting Times *****
Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session
***** Reading Materials *****
There is no textbook for this class. Eight sets of readings from a variety of
sources will be assigned during the term.
For Essay 4, the Book Review, I will give you a list of 20 or so books from
which to select. You may want to purchase that book, or you may choose to work
with a library copy.
I also strongly urge you to purchase a good college dictionary, if you do not
already own one. By that I mean, not a pocket dictionary! If English is not
your first language, you will need at least two good dictionaries. If you are
really interested in good usage, also consider purchasing a dictionary of usage
(I'll show you one in class and explain how they're used).
***** Course Policies *****
**** Attendance ****
This class is structured more as a workshop than a lecture class. Your
responsibility in the class is not only to be a writer, but also to read and
respond to classmates' work and to participate in discussions. Therefore,
attendance is important.
    * If you miss more than two classes for any reason, you risk getting a
      lower grade.
    * If you miss a Workshop class, it will count as two absences.
    * With five unexcused absences you will be withdrawn from the class.
    * It is your responsibility to let me know why you are absent and to keep
      up with assignments when you do miss class.
**** Lateness ****
It is discourteous to your classmates and to your professor. Your grade for
class participation will suffer if you are habitually late. Being more than 10
minutes late 3 times = 1 absence.
**** Deadlines ****
To participate in class discussions, you must read assignments on time. It is
also imperative that you bring a draft to class on workshop days, and be
prepared for oral presentations. Deadlines for revisions will be more flexible.
    * I will collect all your work in a simple Portfolio at the end of the
      term. All work must be handed in no later than Lec #26.
**** Conferences ****
You are required to have one conference with me, but I encourage more. Bring
specific questions about your writing, such as how to make an introduction more
vivid or how to connect the ideas in your essay. You are also welcome to use
conference time to continue discussions begun in class or try out ideas for
essays. If you can't make a conference appointment, please e-mail me or call my
office and let me know.
    * I will schedule a day of conferences on Essay 5 shortly before it is due;
      this meeting will be in addition to your one required conference.
**** Grading ****
    * I will give you abundant comments on first drafts and revisions, and will
      grade each revised and re-revised draft.
    * Please note that for me to evaluate a revised essay, I must have the
      first marked-up draft along with the new one, as well as the designated
      revision cover sheet.
The quality of your writing will be the primary criterion for your semester
grade. I'll also take into consideration effort and improvement, especially as
demonstrated by revision, and class participation, including your participation
in workshops and your oral presentations. Note that revision does not mean
correcting errors nor simply polishing prose; it means re-seeing the entirety
of your essay.
What do letter grades mean? "A" work is so accomplished in skill, substance and
style that it would delight an editor. "B" work is good, solid work. "C" work
is satisfactory but with little to recommend it. "D" work meets the
requirements of the course by the skin of its teeth and by the reader's open-
hearted charity. "F" is reserved for work that does not satisfy the
requirements of the course. Oral presentations will not receive letter grades
but will be marked â (OK), â+ (very good) or â- (weak) based on
preparation, cogency and coherence.
                       Grading criteria.
ACTIVITIES                                          PERCENTAGES
Essay 2                                             15%
Essays 3 and 4 (20% each)                           40%
Essay 5                                             25%
Class participation, oral presentations and essay 1 20%
Note: At the end of the term I will ask to see a Portfolio with all your
drafts, to better judge your progress and accomplishmentâso keep all your
work!
**** Plagiarism ****
Using someone else's language and/or ideas without proper attribution is
academically dishonest. As members of this class and the larger scholarly
community you are expected to abide by the norms of academic honesty. While a
good deal of collaboration is encouraged in and out of class, failing to
acknowledge sources or willfully misrepresenting the work of others as your own
will not be tolerated. Everything you submit must be your own work, written
specifically for this class. Plagiarism can result in withdrawal from the
course with a grade of F, suspension or expulsion from the Institute.
The booklet Academic_Integrity_at_the_Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology:_A
Handbook_for_Students explains these issues in detail, and you are responsible
for understanding its contents. We will work on citing sources in class and
discuss ways to acknowledge them properly. When in doubt, consult with me.
Note: For this class and most classes, it is not acceptable to hand in a paper
that you wrote for another class, even though it is your own work. If you are
ever in doubt, ask your instructor.
***** E-links *****
    * MIT_Libraries
    * Boston_Public_Library
    * MIT_Libraries'_Virtual_Reference_Collection
    * MIT_Writing_Center. You will also find a definition of plagiarism at this
      site, as well as links to style guidelines for MLA and APA style. Note
      that the Writing Center is not just for students who are struggling to
      pass writing classesâit is an excellent resource for all writers in the
      MIT community.
A Final Note: I am happy to hear from you by e-mail with questions and comments
about class, and will respond as promptly as I can. However, I will not read
drafts submitted electronically except by prior agreement with you.
***** Calendar *****
This schedule is our road map for the semester. I may need to amend the
schedule, so use it as a guideline, especially for when essays are due and for
our workshop days.
Homework is always due at the next class meeting, unless otherwise noted.
