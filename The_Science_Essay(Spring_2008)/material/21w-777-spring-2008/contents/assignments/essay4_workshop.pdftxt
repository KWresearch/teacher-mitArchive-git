21W.777 The Science Essay - Spring 2007 
 
Workshopping Essay 4 
Tuesday 4/8 we will workshop two student drafts of Essay 4 in class; Thursday 4/10 we 
will workshop two other drafts. 
 
Here are some questions to help focus our workshopping: Please read the essays and 
consider these questions before we meet to workshop as a class. Remember that we aren’t 
limited to these topics; they are just a place to begin our conversation.  
•  Where do you see the writer inviting readers into the essay? 
•  What context does the writer provide for his/her discussion? 
•  Do you feel like you have a good idea of the book under discussion? 
•  What’s the main theme or idea of this review/essay? 
•  What’s most interesting in this draft?  
•  What’s working well in this draft? 
•  What do you want to hear more about? 
•  Some specific suggestions for the writer for revision? 

 
In addition, to preparing for our class workshop, please respond in writing to each of your 
classmates.  
 
With your written comments, do not limit yourselves to the prompt questions; rather, 
write 1-2 paragraphs of response to the ideas being explored, and make marginal 
comments/questions on the draft. You may do this using our Stellar workshop, or directly 
on the draft itself—whichever you prefer. Just make sure your classmates get your 
written response no later than Thursday’s class, 4/10.
