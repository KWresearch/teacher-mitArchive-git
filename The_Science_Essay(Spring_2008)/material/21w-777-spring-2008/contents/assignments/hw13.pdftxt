21W.777 The Science Essay - Spring 2008 
 
Homework #13 
 

 

 

 

 

 

Due Tuesday 4/1 

 

 

1)  READ the sample Book Reviews I handed out in class Thursday 3/20. Prepare to 
lead a discussion of your assigned review: What do you notice about the way it’s 
constructed, the way the author expresses his/her evaluation of the book, the main 
theme or idea of the review, the way the writer connects with readers….. DO 
carefully read all of the reviews, so that we can have a brisk and focused discussion 
of the Book review as a genre of writing. 
2)  READ or re-read Alan Lightman’s “Prisoner of the Wired World”—we will spend 
part of class discussing this essay.  I am especially interested in the ways you connect 
with Lightman and his ideas, and the ways you see him bringing readers into his 
rather personal discussion. Also pay attention to the structure of this essay, how it 
moves from the personal and particular to much larger themes. 

 
SOME REMINDERS: 
•  The Revision of Essay 3 will be due April 4, which is a Friday. You can bring your 
revised essay, along with a cover sheet that I will provide and your original draft, to 
my office no later than 4:00. 
•  Proposals for Essay 5, the research essay on a topic of your choice, will be due April 
15.  If you haven’t started thinking about your topic, start now—so that you’ll have 
plenty of time to do both preliminary, poking around research, and the more focused 
research that you’ll need when you’ve got your topic narrowed down.
