21W.777 The Science Essay - Spring 2008 
 
Homework #16 and 17 
 
 
 
Due by Sunday night: 
Students: e-mail me 1-2  possible topics for your research based essay (Essay 5). For each 
topic, say what you want to research and why. I will respond asap. 
 
 
Due for Tuesday’s class: 
Everyone: Bring to class a brief proposal for your research based essay. Your proposal 
should include your topic in the form of an inquiry question—i.e., what’ s the question you 
hope to answer in your paper? Also note the science you will be looking at, and the 
motivation—both your own, and why you think your topic/question matters to potential 
readers. 
 
All of this need be no longer than one paragraph. 
 
We will share these in class, aiming to help you clarify your focus, give you an idea of what 
your audience might be especially interested in, and share thoughts on research.
