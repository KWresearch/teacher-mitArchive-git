21W.777 The Science Essay - Spring 2008 
 
 
Homework #25  
 
Portfolios 
You may Re-revise Essays 2, 3 and/or 4. You must give a final polish to Essay 5, 
including either a Works Cited page (if you use MLA style) or a “For Further 
Reading” page if you use what we are calling “magazine style.” 
 
What, Why and How 
In a simple 2-pocket folder, please arrange your drafts and cover sheets as follows:    
• 
In the left-hand pocket, please put drafts of Essay 1-4, with most recent draft 
on top in each set. Include a new cover sheet for each re-revision (see under 
“General” on MIT Server for re-revision cover sheets). 
In the right-hand pocket, put drafts of Essay 5 and Portfolio Cover Letter. 

• 
 
Do NOT print out clean drafts of essays—I want the ones that are marked up with my 
comments. 
 
Cover Letter  
The purpose of the Portfolio is to give you and me an opportunity to reflect on your work 
this term. To aid in this reflection, please address the following questions in a cover 
letter: 

•  What has changed in your writing and/or your approach to writing this term? 
Has anything changed in your reading practice?  
•  Which essay assignment stretched you the most? Explain. 
•  Which of your essays do you like best? Explain 
•  Anything else you want to comment on regarding your writing? (You will 
have an opportunity to comment on the course itself elsewhere.) 

 
When and Where 
Portfolios are due at our last class meeting, on May 15. 
 
I will respond to your letters, and will leave Portfolios with letters to be picked up outside 
my office Monday May 19 after 2:00.
