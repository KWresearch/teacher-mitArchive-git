21W.777 The Science Essay - Spring 2007 
 
Workshopping Essay 5 
 
Tuesday 4/29 we will workshop two drafts of Essay 5 in class; Thursday 5/1 we will 
workshop two other  drafts. 
 

•  Please provide your draft no later than noon Tuesday 4/29.  
•  Please—everyone—bring me a copy of your draft on Tuesday. 
•  Please give yourself time to really read these drafts before class—and make some 
notes to yourself to bring up in workshopping. 
•  Remember to print out copies for the class on your workshop day. 

• 

 
Here are some questions to help focus our workshops. Remember that we aren’t limited 
to these topics; they are just a place to begin our conversation.  
•  What context does the writer provide for his/her discussion? 
•  After the first ¶ or two do you feel like you want to read further? Why or why 
not? 
Is this essay shaped by a clear inquiry question? Does the essay overall seek to 
answer the question that appears in the introduction? 
•  What do you make of the essay’ thesis—is it reasonable? Interesting? Well 
supported by evidence? 
•  How does the writer handle sources—i.e., do you feel confident that the writer 
knows what s/he is talking about, and does s/he give credit where it’s due? When 
sources are named, are they smoothly integrated into the text? 
•  What’s most interesting in this draft?  
•  What’s working well in this draft? 
•  What do you want to hear more about? 
•  Some specific suggestions for the writer for revision? 

 
In addition, to preparing for our class workshop, please respond in writing to each of your 
classmates.  
 
With your written comments, do not limit yourselves to the prompt questions; rather, 
write 1-2 paragraphs of response to the ideas being explored, and make marginal 
comments/questions on the draft. You may do this using our class Web site forum, or 
directly on the draft itself—whichever you prefer. Just make sure your classmates get 
your written response no later than Thursday 5/1 by 6:00pm..
