21W.777 The Science Essay - Spring 2008 
 
Homework #14 
 
For Next Class: READ our final two science essays: 
•  Dennis Overbye’s “Remembrance of Things Future,” which is about the science of 
time travel. Overbye writes on physics topics for the New York Times; this essay 
appeared in the collection “Best American Science and Nature Writing 2006.” 
•  Michael Pollan’s “Unhappy Meals,” which first appeared in the New York Times 
Magazine 28 January 2007. Here is a link to the article, via his website:

This article grew into Pollan’s current book, In Defense of Food. 
 
We will spend most of our class time on Pollan’s essay. We are reading these essays as a way 
of beginning to think of how to put together a longer, research-based science essay.  
 
For Class Discussion: Pollan’s essay is extremely ambitious, and its argument has many 
levels. Notice especially what Pollan is arguing, how he makes his argument—both the shape 
of the essay and the evidence he uses—and how he keeps readers involved (it’s a long 
essay!). 
 
I would also like to hear what questions about research and evidence these essays raise for 
you.
