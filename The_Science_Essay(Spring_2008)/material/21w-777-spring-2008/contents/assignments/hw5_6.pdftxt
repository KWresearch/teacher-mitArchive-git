1)  H. Allen Orr, “Devolution.”  The New Yorker, 30 May 2005. 40-52. [Access via

The first essay considers “intelligent design,” which is has been offered as an 
alternative to evolution; the second explores the ethical dilemmas attendant on 
laboratory creation of chimeras.  Before you read these articles, do 2-3 minutes of 
freewriting on each topic, as a way of bringing to the front of your mind what you 
currently think—if anything!—about these topics. 

I am especially interested in the ways these writers handle the complexity of their         
subjects, and the ways they do (or don’t) treat their subjects fairly. 
 
ALSO: Your book selection for Essay 4 is due—we’ll briefly share these in class.
