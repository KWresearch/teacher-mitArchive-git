QUANTITATING NUCLEIC ACIDS 
DNA or RNA (based on absorbance at 260 nm) 
1.  prepare a dilution of DNA or RNA sample in distilled water (typically 1:100 or 5:500 µl) 
2.  using UV light source, read absorbance at 260nm, may also check absorbance at 280 and 
230nm (260/280 ratio should be roughly 2/1; 260/230 ratio should also approach 2/1) 
3.  to calculate concentration of original solution: 
A260 x conversion factor x dilution factor = original DNA concentration (µg/ml) absorbance unit 
the conversion factor for double stranded DNA is 50µg/ml; for single stranded DNA and RNA 
the conversion factor is 40µg/ml 
The molecular weight of an average deoxynucleotide monophosphate (base) is 326.95. 
Therefore, the average basepair is 753.9. To calculate ,µmoles of ends from this value, for 
example, calculate the following: 
(2 x µg DNA) + [753.9 x (size of double stranded DNA in bp)] 
thus 1µg of pUC DNA corresponds to 2 x 1µg + [753.9 µg/µmol bp x 2676 bp] or 2µg + 
2017436.4 µg/µmol = 1 x 10-6µmol 
Oligodeoxynucleotides 
1. calculate extinction coefficient (e ) for oligonucleotide:  
a. tabulate number of occurrences of each base, A, C, G and T 
b. multiply results by the following values: 
 
number of A's x 
15.4 ml/µmole 
7.3 ml/µmole 
number of C's x 
 
11.7 ml/µmole 
number of G's x 
 
 
number of T's x 
8.8 ml/µmole 
c. the sum of these results is the extinction coefficient, ∈ 
2. determine absorbance of oligonucleotide solution at 260 nm 
3. calculate concentration with the following formula: 
concentration = A260 ÷ ∈ (note: µmole/ml = mM) 
NB. oligonucleotides are frequent supplied as lyophilized powders with amounts listed in 
O.D. units; one O.D. unit in this nomenclature corresponds to the A260 this sample would 
have were it resuspended in 1ml (roughly); this information can be used with the above 
formulae to estimate what the concentration of oligo would be in such a solution and a more 
preferred concentration of oligo can be prepared based on this information; 
for example: 
an oligo has a ∈ of 262.9 ml/µmole; 3 O.D. units were supplied; therefore, a 1ml solution 
would have a concentration of 3 ÷ 262.9 ml/µmole = 11.4 µM to obtain a, say, 20µM solution 
calculate C1V1 = C2V2: 
1ml x 11.4 µM = ? x 20 µM; 
 
resuspend in 570µl! 

(1ml x 11.4µM)/20µM = 0.570ml
