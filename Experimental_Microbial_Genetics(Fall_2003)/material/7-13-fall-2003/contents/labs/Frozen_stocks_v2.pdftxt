FROZEN STOCKS 
 
Archive a sample of a bacterial strain as a frozen stock for future reference whenever you: 
• 
receive a strain from a collaborator 
• 
create a new strain or a new plasmid  
• 
introduce an established plasmid into a new strain.   
This practice is critical for reproducing your results and makes it possible for other researchers to 
build upon the research you have initiated. 
 
1.  Label a 1-2 ml cryovial with  
• 
the name of the bacterial strain  
• 
the plasmid it carries (if applicable) 
•  your name 
• 
the date 
•  You may also want to label the cap of the tube with some shorthand notation 
that makes it easy to locate and identify the tube once it’s in among all of the 
other frozen stocks 
2.  Obtain a dense, freshly grown culture of the bacteria to be stored 
3.  Mix 1:1 with Frozen stock solution in the labeled cryovial 
4.  Store at -80°C 
5.  (This is important) On this date in your notebook, write a complete description of 
the frozen stock, what the strain (and plasmid, if applicable) is, how it was made, 
what it might be used for, what antibiotic resistances it carries, etc.  Without this 
information, it is virtually impossible for future researchers to figure out what your 
stock is
