***** Guidelines and Recommendations for Lab Notebooks *****
The notebook is the key to good experimental practice. It should be a complete
record of all the experiments as they were actually performed. A good notebook
will enable someone to reconstruct, long after the fact, exactly what was done
and why.
Laboratory notebooks should be bound with numbered pages. In the notebook you
should write down, as you go along, what was actually done. Experimental
results, tables, graphs, and photographs should be written directly in your
notebook or taped to the pages for a permanent record.
Your notebook should minimally include the following information:
    * Table of contents
      Leave extra pages at the beginning of the notebook for a table of
      contents, which you'll add as you go along. The table of contents should
      have a short title of each experiment, numbered and dated.
      Â 
    * A short summary of the reasoning for the experiment
      Often a single sentence will suffice. You may want to include a summary
      of the method you will use.
      Â 
    * All the relevant information about the preparation of the experiment
      Much of this can be accomplished by suitable cross references to previous
      experiments. The first time a solution is introduced, its origin should
      be noted. If a component or method is used for the first time, then it
      should be described in detail. The same should apply to bacterial
      strains, plasmids, etc.
      Â 
    * The actual series of events as performed
      Especially important here are the actual times of incubation (as opposed
      to what was planned), any changes in procedure, any unusual observations
      made, etc. Writing down what actually happened can make it possible to
      interpret an experiment even though many mistakes were made.
      Â 
    * The results
      Include raw data in the form in which it was collected. For example,
      record the actual number of colonies found, as well as the cell
      concentration calculated from this number. A brief summary of the results
      and interpretation will also be helpful when reviewing the data at a
      later date.
The main point is that it is unwise to rely solely on memory. The staff urges
you to write directly into your notebooks and not to waste time copying things
down later.
After acquiring some experience, you may want to know something about an early
experiment which did not seem important at the time. If you are in the habit of
writing things as you go along, the chance of being able to learn from the
early experiments is much greater.
