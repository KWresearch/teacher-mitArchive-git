GENOMIC DNA PREPARATION FROM CORYNEBACTERIUM AND 

RHODOCOCCUS, MINI-PROTOCOL


1.	 Spin overnight culture (grown in 10ml LB) for 5 min at 6000 rpm in GSA rotor 
or equivalent 
2.	 Pour off supernatant and freeze cell pellet at -20°c for 30-60 min. (or 
overnight at -70°C) 
3.	 Resuspend cell pellet in 250µl fresh 10mg/ml lysozyme in TE and transfer to 
microcentrifuge tube 
4.	 Add 20 µl mutanolysin (1 mg/ml) 
5.	
Incubate at 37°c for 1-2 hr while gently shaking 
6.	 Add 50 µl 0.5 M EDTA, 50µl 10% SDS, 50 µl 5 M NaCl; Mix gently 
7.	 Add 10 µl fresh 20mg/ml proteinase K (or Sigma cat. no. P5568) and 
incubate at 37°c for 60 min. 
8.	 Add 50 µl sodium perchlorate solution (1 g/ml) to the cell slurry; mix gently 
9.	 Extract with one volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1); mix 
well; centrifuge 5 min in microcentrifuge 
10. Extract aqueous phase (beware phase inversion) with 0.5 volumes of 
chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1); mix well; centrifuge 5 min. in 
microcentrifuge 
11. To aqueous phase add 1 volume isopropanol; microcentrifuge sample for 15 
min; 
12. Wash pellet; dry, resuspend DNA in 200 µl TE; may leave overnight at 4°C 

For routine use, you may stop here; for higher quality DNA, proceed to step 13. 

13. Add 1 µl RNase (0.5 mg/ml) and  incubate at 37°c for 30 min. 
14. Add 0.5 volumes 7.5M ammonium acetate 
15. Extract DNA/ammonium acetate solution with one volume 
phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol; centrifuge 5 min. in microcentrifuge 
16. Extract aqueous phase with 0.5 volumes chloroform:isoamyl alcohol; 
centrifuge 5 min. in microcentrifuge 
17. To aqueous phase add 2 volumes ethanol; microcentrifuge sample for 15 min; 
18. Wash DNA  in 70% ethanol, dry and resuspend  in 200 µl TE.
