ELECTROCOMPETENT RHODOCOCCUS ERYTHROPOLIS SQ1 AND XO1 
1. 
 (Day or two before)  Inoculate small (5-10 ml) cultures of Rhodococcus 
2.  Transfer 0.1-5 ml of overnight culture of Rhodococcus to 200 ml MB 3.5% Glycine 
supplemented with 1.8% sucrose and 0.01% isonicotinic acid hydrazide (isoniazid) in a 
1L baffled flask 
3.  Incubate shaking at 30°C overnight or until O.D.600 is approximately 0.5-0.6  
4.  Add sterile ampicillin to a final concentration of 1 mg/L; continue inccubating for 1.5 hr 
at 30°C 
5.  Pellet the cells by centrifuging for 5 min at 6 000 rpm in a GSA rotor using sterile 
centrifuge bottles or 50 ml conical tubes and proper adapters (may have to spin twice to 
pool) 
6.  Resuspend the cell pellet in 30 ml ice-cold EPB1; Recentrifuge as in step 4 
7.  Wash cell pellet one more time in EPB1; centrifuge as before; discard supernatant 
8.  Wash pellet once in 10 ml ice-cold EPB2; centrifuge as before except at 8000 rpm; discard 
supernatant 
9.  Resuspend final cell pellet in 1 ml EPB2 
10.  Aliquot 150 µl into sterile microfuge tubes and store at -80°C 

Electroporation of Rhodococcus 
1.  Thaw aliquots of electrocompetent Rhodococcus cells on ice 
2.  Mix DNA with 70µl cells in a sterile microfuge tube and incubate on ice for 5 min. 
3.  Electroporate DNA at 2.5 kV, 25 µF and 400 Ω 
4.  Immediately add 300 µl LB 
5.  Incubate cells for recovery at 30°C for 1-20 hours 
6.  Spread cells onto plates with appropriate antibiotics
