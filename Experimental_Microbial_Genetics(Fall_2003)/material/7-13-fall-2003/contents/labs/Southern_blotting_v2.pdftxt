SOUTHERN BLOT PROTOCOL USING DIGOXIGENIN LABELED PROBE, RHODOCOCCUS OPTIMIZED 
selflessly tested , optimized and illustrated with love by xian o’brien 
Recipes for reagents in bold included at the end of this protocol, in italics are included with the Roche DIG labeling and detection kit 
 
LABELING DNA PROBE USING DIG HIGH PRIME LABELING MIX (ROCHE) 
•  dilute 10ng-3µg probe DNA (genomic, plasmid or gene clean fragment) in dsH2O to a final 
volume of 16µl 
•  denature DNA by boiling 10min;  quickly chill on ice to prevent reannealing of strands 
•  add 4µl DIG high prime labeling mix;  mix briefly and tap spin 
• 
incubate overnight at 37°C. 
• 
stop reaction by adding 2µl 0.2M EDTA (pH 8) and heat inactivate at 65°C 10min 
•  boil probe 10-20min before using 
•  used probe can be stored at -20°C in Hybridization Buffer and used repetedly 

 
TRANSFER OF DNA FROM GEL TO MEMBRANE 
• 
run gel at appropriate voltage to obtain clean bands; stain and photograph with size reference 
• 
smaller fragments transfer more efficiently.  for very large DNAs, a 2min UV nicking step on 
a short wave transilluminator can be added 
• 
transfer gel to a sealable Tupperware container 
traditional method of transfer 
• 
incubate 40min at room temperature in 0.25 HCl (sufficient to cover gel) to depurinate 
• 
rinse 2X in MilliQ 
• 
incubate 2X 20min in Denaturation Solution to cleave depurination sites 
• 
incubate 30min in Neutralization Solution 
• 
set up capillary transfer as shown in the schematic below using 20X SSC as the Transfer 
Solution 
• 
transfer overnight (48hr for pulsed field gels) 
alternative quick transfer method (Phil’s favorite) 
• 
incubate at room temperature in 0.25M HCl until dye bands turn yellow (ca. 20min) 
• 
rinse 2X in MilliQ 
• 
set up capillary transfer as shown in the schematic below using 0.4N NaOH as the Transfer 
Solution 
transfer overnight (48hr for pulsed field gels)

SOUTHERN BLOT (CONT.) 
 
FIX DNA TO MEMBRANE 
• 
cut off left top corner of gel and membrane for orienting blot 
• 
restain and photograph gel to assess transfer efficiency 
• 
rinse membrane briefly in 2X SSC and transfer to sealable Tupperware container 
optional: prestrip membrane using BLOT STRIPPING PROTOCOL.  often yields cleaner blots 

 
PROBE MEMBRANE 
•  prehyb membrane on rocker for a minimum of 3hr at 68°C in Hybridization Buffer 
boil probe in 40ml Hybridization Buffer at least 10min to denature 
•  hybridize membrane DNA side down overnight at 68°C (42° for lower homology) in boiled 
Hybridization Buffer/Probe mix, rocking optional 
used Hybridization Buffer/Probe mix can be stored at -20°C and used repeatedly

MEMBRANE DETECTION 
•  wash 2X 15min at room temperature with 2X SSC, 0.1% SDS on rocker 
•  wash 2X 15min at 42°C with 0.5X SSC, 0.1% SDS on rocker (washes can be modified  
to control stringency – this is fairly stringent) 
rinse in Washing Buffer 
incubate 30min at room temperature in Blocking Solution, rocking optional 
incubate 30min at room temperature with 30ml Blocking Solution + 2µl anti-DIG-AP 
Conjugate (premix before adding to blot), rocking optional 
•  wash 2X 15min at room temperature with 100ml Washing Buffer on rocker 
•  equilibrate 5min at room temperature with Detection Buffer 
• 
lay membrane on saran wrap; add 20 drops Ready-To-Use CSPD Reagent 
• 
cover with a second piece of saran wrap 
• 
let stand 3min; squeeze out excess CSPD Reagent from between sheets of plastic wrap 
remove as much as possible to ensure low background on film 
•  expose to file (enzymatic reaction is accelerated at 37°C and slowed at 4°C) 
•  after developing, membranes can be stored as is between sheets of plastic wrap at room 
temperature indefinitely 

 
MEMBRANE STRIPPING 
• 
remove membrane from plastic wrap and place in a sealable Tupperware container 
•  wash 2X 15min at 37°C in Stripping Buffer (no longer!) 
• 
rinse briefly in 2X SSC 
•  membrane is now ready to prehyb
