ELECTROCOMPETENT RHODOCOCCUS ERYTHROPOLIS AN12 
Competent cells for electroporation 
1.  (Day or two before)  Inoculate small (5-10 ml) LB or NBYE cultures of Rhodococcus 
erythropolis AN12; grow at 30°C 
2.  Transfer 0.1-5 ml of overnight culture of Rhodococcus to 200 ml NBYE, 0.05% Tween-80 in 
a 1L baffled flask 
3.  Incubate shaking at 30°C overnight or until O.D.600 is between 0.8 and 1.0  
4.  Pellet the cells by centrifuging for 5 min at 6 000 rpm in a GSA rotor using sterile 
centrifuge bottles or 50 ml conical tubes and proper adapters (may have to spin twice to 
pool) 
5.  Resuspend the cell pellet in 30 ml ice-cold distilled, sterile water; transfer cells to sterile 
50 ml conical tube (if you haven’t already done so); Recentrifuge as in step 4 and discard 
the supernatant 
6.  Resuspend cell pellet one more time in distilled, sterile water; centrifuge as before; 
discard supernatant 
7.  Wash pellet once in 10 ml ice-cold, sterile 10% glycerol; centrifuge as before except at 
8000 rpm; discard supernatant 
8.  Resuspend final cell pellet in 1 ml or less of ice-cold, sterile 10% glycerol 
9.  Aliquot 150 µl into sterile microfuge tubes and store at -80°C 

Electroporation of Rhodococcus 
1.  Thaw aliquots of electrocompetent Rhodococcus cells on ice 
2.  Mix DNA with 70µl cells in a sterile microfuge tube and incubate on ice for 5 min. 
3.  Electroporate DNA at 2.5 kV, 25 µF and 400 Ω 
4.  Immediately add 300 µl NBYE 
5.  Incubate cells for recovery at 30°C for 1-6 hours 
6.  Spread cells onto plates with appropriate antibiotics
