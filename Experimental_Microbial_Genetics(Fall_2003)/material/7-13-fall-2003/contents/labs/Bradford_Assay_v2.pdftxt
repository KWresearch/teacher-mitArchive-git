BRADFORD ASSAY FOR DETERMINING PROTEIN CONCENTRATION 
 
All preparations should be done in/with plastic because the Bradford Reagent reacts 
with glass. 
 
1.  Dilute protein assay reagent (Biorad) 1:4 with milli-Q water (usually 5 mL of reagent 
and 15 mL of water is enough). 
2.  Add 1 mL of reagent to 200 uL of each protein sample. 
3.  Measure the absorbance of each sample at 595 nm. 
 
To determine the concentration of your sample, plot a standard curve and extrapolate 
back to your reading.  Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is usually the protein standard of 
choice.  The table below indicates the amounts of 400 ug/mL BSA you should mix with 
water or buffer to give the concentrations shown.
