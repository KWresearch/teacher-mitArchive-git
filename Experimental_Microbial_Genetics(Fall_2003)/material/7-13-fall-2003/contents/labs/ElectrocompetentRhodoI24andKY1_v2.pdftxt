ELECTROCOMPETENT RHODOCOCCUS I24 AND KY1 
1.  (Day or two before)  Inoculate small (5-10 ml) cultures of Rhodococcus I24; grow at 37°C 
2.  Transfer 0.1-5 ml of overnight culture of Rhodococcus to 200 ml MB 1.5% Glycine (for I24 
strain) or TSB Glycine (for KY1 strain) in a 1L baffled flask 
3.  Incubate shaking at 37°C overnight or until O.D.600 is approximately 0.25  
4.  Pellet the cells by centrifuging for 5 min at 6 000 rpm in a GSA rotor using sterile 
centrifuge bottles or 50 ml conical tubes and proper adapters (may have to spin twice to 
pool) 
5.  Resuspend the cell pellet in 30 ml ice-cold EPB1; Recentrifuge as in step 4 
6.  Wash cell pellet one more time in EPB1; centrifuge as before; discard supernatant 
7.  Wash pellet once in 10 ml ice-cold EPB2; centrifuge as before except at 8000 rpm; discard 
supernatant 
8.  Resuspend final cell pellet in 1 ml or less of EPB2 
9.  Aliquot 150 µl into sterile microfuge tubes and store at -80°C 

Electroporation of Rhodococcus 
7.  Thaw aliquots of electrocompetent Rhodococcus cells on ice 
8.  Mix DNA with 70µl cells in a sterile microfuge tube and incubate on ice for 5 min. 
9.  Electroporate DNA at 2.5 kV, 25 µF and 400 Ω 
10.  Immediately add 300 µl LB 
11.  Incubate cells for recovery at 30°C for 1-20 hours 
12.  Spread cells onto plates with appropriate antibiotics
