ELECTROCOMPETENT E.COLI CELLS  
(Competent cells for electroporation) 
 
Day 1 
1.  Start an overnight culture of the appropriate strain (e.g. XL1-Blue, DH5α) in LB or other rich 
medium; grow at 37°C 
2.  Autoclave some large centrifuge bottles (250-500ml) for spinning down cells tomorrow 
3.  Place bottles of sterile water (total = ~1.5 liters) in the cold room for resuspending cells tomorrow 
 
1.  Day 2 
4.  Transfer 0.2 to 1 ml of the overnight culture to 500 ml aliquots of LB (or other rich medium) in 1-
2 liter baffled flask 
5.  Incubate at 37°C with vigorous agitation for 2-6 hours 
6.  Monitor O.D.600 periodically (every 30 min. after the first hour of incubation) 
7.  When the O.D.600 reaches 0.5 to 1.0, remove flasks from the incubator and chill on ice for at 
least 15 minutes (cultures may be left this way for several hours if necessary) 
8.  Centrifuge cells at 5000g for 15 min., 4°C; pour off supernatant   
2.  (pellet may be stored at 4°C in 10% glycerol for a day or two if necessary at this point) 
9.  Resuspend cells in ice cold water (sterile).  First resuspend in a small volume (a few milliliters) 
with vortexing or pipetting, then dilute with more water to bring centrifuge bottle to about two-
thirds full. 
10.  Centrifuge as above; carefully pour off supernatant 
11.  Resuspend in cold sterile water as before 
12.  Centrifuge, pour off supernatant 
13.  Resuspend pellet in 20 ml ice cold, sterile 10% glycerol 
14.  Centrifuge as before; carefully remove supernatant (pellet is likely to be very loose) 
15.  Resuspend cells to a final volume fo 2-3 ml with 10% glycerol 
6.  Divide the cells into 150 µl aliquots in eppendorf tubes and store at -80°C

E
 
1.  Thaw an aliquot of electrocompetent cells on ice 
2.  Add 1-3µl DNA to the cells; incubate on ice for ~5 min. 
3.  Transfer to chilled 2mm electroporation cuvette (no bub
bles!) 
4.  Have P1000 with 300µl LB or 2xYT ready to dispense 
5.  Pulse cuvette @ 200 ohms, 25µFd, 2.5 kV (check time cons
6.  IMMEDIATELY add the 300µl LB or 2xYT to the cuvett
e 
7. 
incubate the cells at 37°C for 40 m
in to 1 hour to recover 
 
8. plate cells onto selective medium 

lectroporation of DNA into electrocompetent cells 

tant, should be somewhere above 3)
