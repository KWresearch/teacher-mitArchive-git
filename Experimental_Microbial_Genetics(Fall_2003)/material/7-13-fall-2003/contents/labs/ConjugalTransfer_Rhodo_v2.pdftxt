CONJUGAL TRANSFER OF DNA USING RHODOCOCCUS SP. B264-1  
(Mating protocol for transferring pB264-based plasmids from Rhodococcus B264-1 donors to 
recipient cells) 
 
Preparation of Donor and Recipient Cultures 
1.  Transform pB264-based plasmid into the B264-1 strain of Rhodococcus (see 
separate protocol for electroporation of Corynebacterium and Rhodococcus sp. 
B264-1); verify transformants 
2.  Inoculate a small volume (2-10 ml) culture of the donor strain (B264-1) 
carrying the plasmid in LB medium supplemented with an appropriate 
antibiotic; also inoculate negative controls (e.g. B264-1 lacking a plasmid) in 
an appropriate medium; grow at 30°C (2-3 days) 
3.  Inoculate a small volume culture (2-10 ml) of the recipient (strain into which 
the plasmid will be transferred) in LB; grow at an appropriate temperature 
(e.g. 37°C for Rhodococcus sp. I24; 30°C for other Rhodococcus strains) for 2-3 
days 
Plates 
4.  Prepare LB plates (no antibiotics) as well as LB plates containing antibiotics 
appropriate for selecting transconjugants 
Mating (once the donor and recipient cultures have grown) 
5.  Onto the center of each of an appropriate number of LB plates (one per 
donor/recipient pair) place one 25 mm mixed cellulose ester (MCE) filter 
(e.g. Millipore cat no. HAWP02500); drip onto the center of this filter 100-200µl of 
95% ethanol; place these plates at 30°C with the lids askew to dry for 30-40min. 
6.  Transfer 0.5 ml of each donor culture (including controls) to a separate, sterile 
1.6 ml microcentrifuge tube 
7.  Briefly (30s-1min) centrifuge the culture to pellet the cells; discard the 
supernatant by drawing it off with a Pipetman (be careful not to contaminate 
the culture) 
8.  Pipette 500µl of fresh LB (no antibiotics) onto the pellet; vortex to resuspend 
the cells 
9.  Briefly (30s-1min) centrifuge the culture to pellet the cells; discard the 
supernatant by drawing it off with a Pipetman; (this step serves to wash 
residual antibiotics out of the cell slurry) 
10.  Pipette onto this pellet a 500µl aliquot of the recipient cell culture 
11.  Briefly (30s-1min) centrifuge the culture to pellet the cells; discard the 
supernatant by drawing it off with a Pipetman (you may notice a two-color 
cell pellet at this point)

12.  Pipette ~100µl of fresh LB onto the pelleted cells; resuspend the cells together 
by pippetting up and down repeatedly until you get a uniform slurry 
13.  Using a Pipetman, pipette the cell slurry (mating mixture) out of the 
microcentrifuge tube and drip it onto the very center of the dried MCE filters 
(prepared in step 5, above) 
14.  Incubate the plates at 30°C overnight 
Selection 
15.  Dry the plates that will be used for selection for ~30min. 
16.  Using sterilized forceps (flamed with ethanol), pry the MCE filters from the 
LB plates and place each in a separate 50ml conical tube (e.g. a blue-capped 
falcon tube) 
17.  Pipette 500µl LB into each tube; use the Pipetman and/or vortexing to wash 
the mating mixture from the MCE filter and resuspend the cells in the LB 
18.  Transfer as much of the mating mixture slurry to the center of a dried 
selection plate; suing a sterilized glass spreader, spread the cell slurry until 
the liquid is fully absorbed into the agar 
19.  Incubate at an appropriate temperature 
 
Notes on selection criteria 
Selection must be carried out in such a way that donor cells do not grow while 
transconjugants do.  For example, conjugal transfers between Rhodococcus strains 
B264-1 (donor) and SQ1 (recipient) can be selected by adding to the plate (1) an 
antibiotic to select for the presence of the plasmid and (2) an antibiotic to which 
the recipient strain is resistant (for SQ1, rifampicin or streptomycin would work) 
but to which the donor strain is sensitive.  In matings between Rhodococcus 
strains B264-1 (donor) and I24 (recipient), an antibiotic must still be used to select 
for the appearance of the plasmid, but instead of using an antibiotic to select for 
the recipient strain, temperature may be used to select against the donors.  That 
is, while I24 will grow at 37°C, B264-1 will not.  This strategy will only work if 
the plasmid being transferred can replicate stably at 37°C, though.
