PHENOL EXTRACTION (FOR DNA PURIFICATION) 
 
1. 

To resuspended DNA sample (from minprep or other source) add 1 volume of equilibrated 
phenol (pH 8.0) or phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol mixture (25:24:1) 
2.  Mix vigorously with vortex 
3. 
Centrifuge at 5 000xg for 5 min or microfuge for 5 min 
4. 
Carefully transfer upper aqueous phase to fresh, labelled tube; stay away from the white 
material at the interface (it is better to leave a small amount of aqueous material behind than it 
is to carry over a small amount of the interface) 
If the interface is especially thick, repeat steps 1 through 4 
To the aqueous sample, add 1 volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol mixture (24:1) 
Centrifuge as above 
Transfer to a fresh labelled tube and proceed to ethanol or isopropanol preciptation
