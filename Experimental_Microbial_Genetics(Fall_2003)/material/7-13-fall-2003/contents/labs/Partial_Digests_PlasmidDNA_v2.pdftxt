PARTIAL DIGESTS OF PLASMID DNA  
(Restriction digests that affect only a subset of the target restriction sites; for difficult clonings) 
 
•  Have a timer or watch handy 
•  Pour an agarose gel to separate your digestion products 
•  Label four 0.6ml microcentrifuge tubes as follows: 0, 1, 5 and 20 
• 
Into each tube, pipette 3µl STOP mix 
•  Prepare a restriction enzyme digest as follows 
  ~4µg plasmid DNA 
  4µl 10x restriction enzyme buffer 
  4µl 1 mg/ml BSA 
  0.5µl RNase (0.5 mg/ml, if necessary) 
adjust volume to 40µl with dsH20 
•  Remove 10µl from the mixture and place it into the tube labeled “0” 
•  Add ~0.5µl restriction enzyme to the digestion mixture from step (cid:31); mix; note the 
time 
•  After 60s, remove 10µl from the reaction mix and transfer it to the tube labeled “1”; 
mix well 
•  After 4 more minutes, remove 10µl from the reaction mixture and transfer it to the 
tube labeled “5”; mix well 
•  After 15 more minutes, remove 10µl from the reaction mixture and transfer it to the 
tube labeled “20”; mix well 
•  Load samples onto agarose gel 
 
STOP mix 
100µl 0.5M EDTA, pH 8 
200µl 6x loading dye
