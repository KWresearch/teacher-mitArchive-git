GUS ASSAY 
The Quasi Definitive Guide to Determining β-Glucuronidase Activity in Cell Lysates  (special bonus protocols for 
the harvesting and lysis of E. coli, Rhodococcus and Corynebacterium) 
by Jennie Cho, (modified and spiffed up by xian o’brien, selflessly edited by Phil Lessard) 
 
Adapted from Wilson et al., The Escherichia coli gus Operon: Induction and Expression of the gus Operon in E.coli and 
the Occurrence and Use of GUS in Other Bacteria.  From GUS Protocols: Using the GUS Gene as a Reporter of 
Gene Expression.  Ed. Sean R. Gallagher, Academic Press, Inc., 1992. 
 
Harvesting of Cultures 
4.  At appropriate time points during the culture, remove 1.6 ml of culture into a 2ml 
Eppendorf tube and place on ice.   
5.  Working quickly, briefly vortex the 1.6 ml sample and remove 100 uL into a 
spectrophotometer cuvette containing 900 uL fresh culture media.  Spin down the remaining 
1.5 ml sample, remove the supernatant and place the pellet immediately at -80°C.  (Note: 
Samples will keep at -80°C indefinitely; do NOT freeze at -20°C.) 
6.  Measure and note the OD600 of the 1:10 dilution.  (Note:  The OD600 of your sample will 
factor into the later calculation of GUS activity.) 
 
Lysing of Cells 
8.  Thaw sample pellets on ice. 
9.  Resuspend pellets in 374 uL B-PER™ Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce product 
78248), 50 uL Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail for use with bacterial cell extracts 
(Sigma product P8465; reconstituted per manufacturer’s indications), 1 uL 34 mg/mL 
chloramphenicol (prepared in methanol), and 6 uL 10mg/ml lysozyme (prepared fresh in 
dH20; can be omitted when working with E. coli).   
10.  Vortex vigorously for 1 min. 
11.  Incubate on ice for 5 min. 
12.  At this point, what you have is a crude lysate slurry that can be assayed for GUS activity 
using the procedure in the next section yielding a measure of activity in terms of nM 
product formed/minute · OD600 unit.  (Note:  For Corynebacterium and Rhodococcus this is the 
best you can hope for using this lysis procedure). 
13.  For E. coli samples, spin down the crude lysate 1 min and place on ice. 
14.  What you have now is a cleared lysate (the supernatant cleared of cell debris).  The protein 
concentration of the cleared lysate can be determined using the Bradford assay (see the 
separate protocol for this assay).  The cleared lysate can be assayed for GUS activity using 
the procedure described in the next section, yielding a measure of activity in terms of nM 
product formed/minute · mg protein.  (Note:  Activity per mg protein is a more desirable 
measure of activity than activity per OD600 unit.  Think about it.)

GUS Assay 
1.  Keep cell lysates on ice. 
2.  Prepare fresh GUS assay buffer and prewarm to 37°C.   
3.  Prepare disposable cuvettes (at least 3 per assay), each containing 800 uL 0.4 M Na2CO3 
(stop solution).    
4.  Prepare one 2 mL Eppendorf tube per sample containing 800 uL of the GUS assay buffer 
prepared as above.  Add 200 uL cell lysate to the tube.  (This gives a final concentration of 
PNPG 1mM.)  Note time.  
5.  Place reactions at 37°C and note the time.  (Note: A water bath is preferable, but consistency 
is key.)  Watch for development of yellow color (p-nitrophenol).  At no fewer than 3 time 
points, (e.g. 15, 30, 45 minutes) remove 100 uL from each sample into a spectrophotometer 
cuvette.  (Note:  When assaying crude lysate slurry, tap spin the reaction tubes and remove 
100 uL of the supernatant into the spectrophotometer cuvette.)  Briefly vortex the reaction 
tubes and return to 37°C quickly.  The time points do not have to be equally spaced, but be 
sure to note each time.   
6.  Measure absorbance at 405 nm for each time point against a stopped blank reaction. (Note: 
The color formation is stable in the stop solution. Less error is introduced if you measure the 
absorbance of all of the time points at once rather than after each time point.) 
 
Calculating the Rate of Reaction 
1.  For each sample, plot a graph of OD405 (y-axis) vs. time (x-axis).  Calculate the slope S of the 
graph (which should be linear!) in OD405 units per minute.  (Or cheat and have Excel 
calculate it for you)  
2.  The rate of reaction R (in nanomoles product per minute per OD600 unit)** for each sample is 
then: 
 

 

 

© P .   L E S S A R D   2 0 0 2 ,   A L L   R I G H T S   R E S E R V E D  

R = S/(0.02 x V x OD600) 

 
where V is the volume assayed in milliliters.  In this case, V = 0.02 mL because 0.2 mL 
sample is used in the initial reaction (step 3) and one-tenth of this (100 uL) is removed into 
stop solution for each time point (step 4).  The 0.02 in the denominator has been derived 
from the molar extinction coefficient of p-nitrophenol.  Under the conditions specified by 
this particular protocol, the molar extinction coefficient of p-nitrophenol is 18,000.  In the 900 
uL final volume, an absorbance of 0.02 represents 1 nmol of product produced. 
 

**The rate of reaction R can also be calculated in terms of nanomoles product per minute 
per mg protein: 
 

R = S/(0.02 x V x protein concentration) 

 
The Bradford Assay can be used to determine the protein concentration of each sample.
