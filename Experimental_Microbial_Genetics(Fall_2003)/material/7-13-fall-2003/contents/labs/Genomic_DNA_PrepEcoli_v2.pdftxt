GENOMIC DNA PREPARATION FROM E. COLI CELLS 
Adapted from Current Protocols in Molecular Biology (2.4.1-2.4.2)  
 
1.  Spin 3 ml from an overnight culture of E. coli cells at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge fro 2 
minutes; discard the supernatant 
2.  Resuspend the cell pellet in 567 µl TE (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) 
3.  Add 30 µl 10% SDS and 3 µl 20 mg/ml proteinase K; mix thoroughly and incubate 1 hr at 37ºC 
4.  Add an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1); mix well by shaking up 
and down vigorously (do not vortex); spin in microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 10 minutes 
5.  Transfer the aqueous top layer to a fresh microcentrifuge tube with a Pasteur pipette; add an equal 
volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol; mix well and microcentrifuge for 10 minutes
