β-GALACTOSIDASE (LACZ) ASSAY 
 
1.  Thaw samples on ice, then prepare lysates (see notes below on sample collection and 
preparation of lysates) 
2.  Prepare several (at least 3 per sample along with a single blank) plastic cuvettes, 
each containing 500 µl sodium carbonate stop solution; you may wish to label these 
with some notation of the sample to be tested and the timepoint to be used 
3.  Place into a microcentrifuge tube the following: 
•  400 µl sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) 
•  133 µl ONPG solution 
•  6 µl magnesium solution 
4.  Preincubate these reaction mixtures at 37ºC by placing them in an appropriate water 
bath or a heat block 
5.  Once they’ve been prewarmed, add 
•  60 µl cell extract 
• 
it would be wise to also carry out a negative control sample with either 
extraction instead of cell extract or with cell extract from cells that do not 
express β-galactosidase 
6.  Watch for the appearance of a yellow color (o-nitrophenol) in each reaction tube; At 
appropriate timepoints, remove 100 µl aliquots from each reaction mixture and add 
it to one of the cuvettes containing the sodium carbonate stop solution 
7.  Once all of the timepoints have been taken, read the optical density at 420 nm; record 
the absorbance and calculate the slopes of the absorbance over time; the slope is 
proportional to the β-galactosidase activity; NOTE: A420 values above 1.0 should not 
be trusted 
8.  To calculate the actual activity, prepare a standard curve of o-nitrophenol and 
determine the absorbance of this product at each concentration; one unit of enzyme 
will catalyze the production of 1 µmol of o-nitrophenol per minute at 37ºC 

Notes on harvesting and lysing cells 
Harvesting of Cultures 
1.  At appropriate time points during the culture, remove 1.6 ml of culture into an 
Eppendorf tube and place on ice.   
2.  Working quickly, briefly vortex the 1.6 ml sample and remove 100 µL into a 
spectrophotometer cuvette containing 900 µL fresh culture media.  Spin down the 
remaining 1.5 ml sample, remove the supernatant and place the pellet immediately 
at -80°C.  (Note: Samples will keep at -80°C indefinitely; do NOT freeze at -20°C.)

3.  Measure and note the OD600 of the 1:10 dilution of the cell culture.  (Note:  The OD600 
of your sample will factor into the later calculation of lacZ activity.) 
 
Lysing of Cells 
1.  Thaw sample pellets on ice. 
2.  Resuspend pellets in 374 µL B-PER™ Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent (Pierce 
product 78248), 50 µL Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail for use with 
bacterial cell extracts (Sigma product P8465; reconstituted per manufacturer’s 
indications), 1 uL 34 mg/mL chloramphenicol (prepared in methanol), and 6 µL 
10mg/ml lysozyme (prepared fresh in dH20; can be omitted when working with E. 
coli).   
3.  Vortex vigorously for 1 min. 
4.  Incubate on ice for 5 min. 
5.  At this point, what you have is a crude lysate slurry that can be assayed for lacZ 
activity using the procedure in the previous section yielding a measure of activity in 
terms of amount of product formed/minute per OD600 unit.  (Note:  For 
Corynebacterium and Rhodococcus this is the best you can hope for using this lysis 
procedure). 
6.  For E. coli samples, spin down the crude lysate 1 min and place on ice. 
7.  What you have now is a cleared lysate (the supernatant cleared of cell debris).  The 
protein concentration of the cleared lysate can be determined using the Bradford 
assay (see the separate protocol for this assay).  The cleared lysate can be assayed for 
lacZ activity using the procedure described in the previous section, yielding a 
measure of activity in terms of nM product formed/minute per mg protein.  (Note:  
Activity per mg protein is a more desirable measure of activity than activity per 
OD600 unit.)
