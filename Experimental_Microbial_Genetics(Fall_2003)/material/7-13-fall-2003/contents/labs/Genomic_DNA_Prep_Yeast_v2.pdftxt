GENOMIC DNA PREPARATION FROM SACCHAROMYCES CEREVISIAE 
MINI-PROTOCOL 
1.  Grow a 10ml overnight culture to saturation (OD600~2-3). 
2.  Spin down the cells in a centrifuge (~2,000rpm in Sorvall) and wash with an 
equal volume of cold, distilled, sterile water. 
3.  Resuspend the cell pellet in 200µl lysis buffer, then add ~300µl glass beads and 
200µl 1:1 phenol:chloroform. 
4.  Vortex for 1-2min. 
5.  Add 200µl TE buffer and mix 6-10 times by inversion.  WARNING: vortexing  
from this step on can shear the DNA. 
6.  Spin samples for 5min at 13,000rpm in a microfuge 
7.  Transfer the aqueous (top) phase to a fresh eppendorf tube. 
8.  Add 1 volume (400µl) chloroform and mix by inversion. 
9.  Centrifuge as in step 6  
10.  Transfer the aqueous (top) phase to a fresh eppendorf tube. 
11.  Add 1ml 100% EtOH and mix by inversion. 
12.  Spin in a microfuge for 2min at 13,000rpm. 
13.  Remove the supernatant and wash the pellet with 1ml 70% EtOH. 
14.  Remove the supernatant completely and dry the pellet at room temperature.  
When dry the pellet will be whitish and should not smell like ethanol. 
15.  Resuspend the pellet in 400µl TE buffer containing a final concentration of 
2µg/ml RNaseA. 
16.  Incubate 10min at 37°C. 
17.  Repeat steps 9-12. 
18.  Resuspend the pellet in 50µl TE.
