PCR AMPLIFICATION FROM GC-RICH TEMPLATES 
Based on recommendations from the Qiagen HotStarTaq kit and using the kit’s 
reagents where indicated(*) 
 

10 µL 
20 µL 
2.0 µL (200 uM final) 

1 µL (1 µM final) 
1 µL (1 µM final) 
64.5 µL 
1 µL 
0.5 µL (2.5 units final) 

For a reaction volume of 100 µL, assemble the following: 
 
QIAGEN PCR buffer* (10x): 
Q-solution* (5x): 
dNTP mix (10 mM each): 
(purchased or prepared by 
mixing equal amounts from 
100 mM stocks of each dNTP) 
5' primer (100 µM): 
3' primer (100 µM): 
filtered milliQ water: 
template** (<<1 µg/µL): 
HotStarTaq*: 
 
 
When using the HotStarTaq reagents, the first step in the thermal cycler should 
be a 15 minute incubation at 95°C to activate the polymerase; following this, you 
may program any standard cycling conditions with denaturing times typically 
from 30 seconds to 1 minute, annealing times from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, and 
extension times from from 1-3 minutes; annealing temperatures should be a 
function of the primers’ TM’s, typically in the range of 50-60°C for GC-rich 
templates; remember to finish the cycling with an extra 10 minutes at the 
extension temperature (72°C); refer to the HotStarTaq manual for additional tips 
and considerations. 
 
**Too much template is as bad as no template.  Although the precise amount is 
not critical, shoot for something in the range of 10-50ng of template
