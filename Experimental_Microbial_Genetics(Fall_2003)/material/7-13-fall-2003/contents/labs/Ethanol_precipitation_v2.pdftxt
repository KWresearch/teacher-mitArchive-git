ETHANOL PRECIPITATION OF NUCLEIC ACIDS IN AQUEOUS 
SOLUTION 
1.  Determine approximate volume of solution 
2.  Add either 1/2 volume of 7.5 M ammonium acetate 
-or- 
1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.3 
3.  Add 2.5 to 3 (original) volumes of cold ethanol 
4.  Mix, and incubate on ice (or at -20°C) 15 minutes to overnight 
5.  Centrifuge 15-20 minutes at high speed (in microfuge for small volumes, or in SS34 
at 8 000 rpm) 
6.  Discard supernatant 
7.  Wash pellet by adding one original volume cold 70% ethanol 
8.  Recentrifuge if pellet has become dislodged 
9.  Discard supernantant 
10.  Dry pellet either by air drying at room temperature or with Speed-Vac
