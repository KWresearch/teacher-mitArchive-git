Literature Searches
When trying to identify papers from the primary literature, you may find it
useful to use the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) website.
This site hostsÂ PubMed, an online literature search resource. Many of the
titles and abstracts that can be reached through PubMed also have links to
online versions (PDFs or full text versions) of the associated papers.
Another online literature search tool is theÂ Web_of_Science_database. This
tool is similar in some respects to PubMed, except that it is not so strongly
focused on medically-related journals, and includes journals not indexed on
PubMed.
Web of Science also enables searches of the Science Citation Index, which
allows you to ask the question, "What papers have been written recently that
cite a paper I already have?" This type of search is very useful for keeping
up-to-date in a research field.

DNA Sequence Analysis
Sequence searches can be carried out using the GenBank search tools available
on the NCBI site. Most valuable of these is probably theÂ EntrezÂ browser,
which can be used to find DNA sequences based upon keyword searches.
If you have a DNA sequence and would like to ask whether other sequences are
known with homology to your sequence, use theÂ BLAST_tool_(BLASTn). With this
tool, you can paste your sequence into a window and the NCBI server will
compare it to all known sequences, pulling up anything that matches.
On the other hand, if you have 2 sequences and want to know whether these two
specifically match, you can use the "BLAST_2_Sequences_tool".
In some cases, rather than searching for DNA sequences that closely match your
own sequence, you may want to identify proteins whose sequences are homologous
to those encoded by your DNA element. To do this, use theÂ BLASTx_tool. This
tool will translate the DNA sequence you enter and will compare it to known
protein sequences or translation products of known DNA sequences.
While trying to understand how different biochemical pathways fit together in a
cell, or when you are simply trying to see a snapshot of an entire
physiological pathway, it is often easier to forgo the usual perusal of Stryer
and to instead find a useful website.Â The_Kyoto_Encyclopedia_of_Genes_and
GenomesÂ is very useful for giving you such a snapshot of metabolism. The site
also provides links to enzymes, structures and other useful information.
If you are specifically interested in pathways involved in the degradation of
xenobiotics (nasty environmental toxins like naphthalene, toluene, benzene,
PCBs, etc.) you may want to check out The_University_of_Minnesota_Biocatalysis/
Biodegradation_Database.
