Writing Workshop #3

• Results and Discussion

– The examples on the following slides were all 
excerpted from real papers
– These illustrate common problems that students 
encounter when drafting their Results and Discussion 
sections
– When reviewing each of these examples, ask 
yourself whether your own paper could provoke a 
similar criticism.
– How might you change your own writing to address 
or avoid such criticisms?

Distinguish the assay from the concept

Assaying … promoter activity
To determine the activity of the … promoter in the wild type and mutant 
strains of AN12, we performed a GUS assay.

Transcriptional Fusion Assay Analysis
GUS assays were performed in order to both reveal whether or not the 
promoter is transcriptionally active and to measure the promoter activity in each 
of the different strains if it is transcriptionally active.
In order to perform the GUS assays, constructs were made by ligating the 
putative promoters from the … gene into the expression vector pAL280.

In order to determine whether the transposome had really inserted at random into 
the genome, we examined the sequences in the genome into which the 
transposons had inserted.  To do this, we first recovered each of the transposons 
along with a portion of the adjacent genomic DNA via a plasmid rescue 
procedure (see Materials and Methods).  Sequencing the genomic DNA 
recovered in this manner revealed...

…the plasmid integrated into the genome by homologous recombination with the

true breeding experiment.  In this experiment, recombinant cells were grown at 
the non-permissive temperature in the absence of antibiotic selection for 
approximately 10 generations.  Following this period, aliquots from this culture 
were plated onto selective (LB with 5 mg/L gentamicin) or non-selective (LB) 
media.  The ratio of the number of colonies on the selective plates to those on the 
non-selective plates reflected the proportion that had retained the integrated

Discussion
While many eukaryotes produce isoprenoids via mevalonate, very few 
prokaryotes use this pathway, the non-mevalonate pathway being much more 
common.  Therefore it is not surprising to find genes encoding the entire 
enzymatic complement for the non-mevalonate pathway in the bacterium we 
studied. What is peculiar, though, is the presence of a gene encoding HMG-CoA
reductase.  In other organisms, this enzyme constitutes the first committed step 
toward isoprenoid biosynthesis via the mevalonate pathway, and the enzyme is 
rarely encountered in any other context.  In this project we sought to determine 
the role of HMG-CoA reductase in this strain.

We cloned and sequenced the HMG-CoA reductase gene from the bacterrial 
chromosome and found a small number of sequence discrepencies relative to that 
reported in the genome database.  This sequence deviation is not surprising 
because…

…In similar bacteria, such as Streptococcus salivarius, Shine Delgarno
sequences have been found upstream of the ptsH gene (Gagnon et al., 1993), 
which enabled these researchers to identify the location of the ptsH promoter 
in that species.  A similar strategy would be helpful for identifying the 
location of the ptsH promoter in Rhodococcus, had such a consensus 
sequence already been identified. Two carbon source regulated promoters 
for ptsH in Streptomyces coelicolor have also been found (Nothaft et al.,
2003).  The more proximal of these two promoters was constitutively 
expressed, whereas the distal promoter was strongly induced by glucose.   
This illustrates the possibility that…

Given how little is known about the mechanism of conjugal transfer between 
rhodococci, any progress in this field would be welcomed. Rhodococcus sp.
B264-1 has the ability to transfer DNA to other Rhodococcus strains, and it is 
reasonable to suspect that the genes required for this activity lie on one of the two
megaplasmids that reside within B264-1.  While it is clear that there is still much 
work to do, we have taken the first steps toward genetically tagging the elements 
required for conjugal transfer in Rhodococcus sp. B264-1…

…Another possible explanation for the knockout growth is that over longer 
periods, quinones and other metabolic byproducts have diffused from the KY1 
side of the plate to the 50A2 side (Figure 3c) and the cells are able to metabolize 
these, if poorly.

The results we have obtained to date argue in favor of the hypothesis that nimB 
encodes a function that is critical for naphthalene metabolism in Rhodococcus sp. 
KY1.  However, it is also clear that more work will be needed to confirm the 
precise role of this gene as well as that of the neighboring gene, ORF5468.  
Continued research into this area will shed important light on the degradation of 
aromatic hydrocarbons among rhodococci.
