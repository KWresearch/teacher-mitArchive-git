Abstract 
 

The carotenoid pathway has not been studied in great depth in Rhodococcus.  We 
studied the carotenoid pathway in Rhodococcus erythropolis AN12 by attempting to 
overexpress several genes of the carotenoid pathway.  We cloned the genes and 
introduced them into expression vectors.  The expression vectors were introduced into 
wildtype R. erythropolis AN12 and their effect on carotenoid accumulation was 
measured.  Expression vectors containing dxs, which encodes 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-
phosphate (DOXP) synthase, or crtE, which encodes geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate 
synthase, increased the carotenoid accumulation approximately two fold when compared 
to the controls.  In contrast, overexpression of crtB and crtI had no obvious effect on 
carotenoid accumulation in R. erythropolis AN12.  This study presents the first analysis 
of carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in Rhodococcus. 
 
Introduction 
 

The carotenoid pathway in Rhodococcus, and most bacteria, is largely 
understudied.  A better understanding of carotenoid synthesis in bacteria such as 
Rhodococcus has important commercial as well as scientific implications (Oh et al., 
2000).  Carotenoids function as antioxidants because they reduce free radical 
concentrations and consume O2 (Nelson et al., 2003).  In nature, carotenoids serve as 
precursors to vitamins, including vitamin A, and phytohormones, and function as 
accessory pigments in photosynthetic membranes.  Carotenoids are also animal feed 
additives, as they are necessary to the health of animals but found in minimal levels in the 
starchy feed.  Carotenoids are used as pigments for salmon and other food products, and 
represent a large portion of the salmon farming cost (Lorenz and Cysewski, 2000). 
 
Carotenoid biosynthesis in bacteria starts with the dxp (non-mevolanate) pathway, 
which forms isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) 
(Kim and Keasling, 2001).  A multi-step pathway converts IPP and DMAPP to 
geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), the precursor molecule to carotenoids.  Enzymes 
encoded by the crt genes consume GGPP to form specific carotenoids (Figure 1) 
(Misawa et al, 1995).

Carotenoid gene expression 
has been manipulated in many 
organisms, including yeast, 
Escherichia coli, Rhodococcus, 
and plants (Kostichka et al., 2003; 
Mann et al., 2000; Verdoes et al., 
2003; Matthews and Wurtzel, 
2000).  Overexpressing crtI and 
crtYB in the yeast 
Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous 
caused a significant increase in 
total accumulated carotenoids.  In 
X. dendrorhous, the crtYB gene 
serves the same function as the 
separate bacterial crtY and crtB 
genes.  E. coli, which does not 
naturally produce carotenoids, 
accumulated beta-carotene when 
crtE, crtI, crtB, and dxs were 
expressed from a plasmid (Verdoes 
et al, 2003). 
Unlike E. coli, 
Rhodococcus naturally produce 
carotenoids, such as beta-carotene.  
Some strains of Rhodococcus 
accumulate high levels of 
carotenoids.  In addition to being 
able to make these compounds, 
Rhodococcus erythropolis AN12 is 
also relatively easy to transform 
with expression vectors.  While 
these features are attractive, the 
AN12 strain does not accumulate 
carotenoids as effectively as other 
Rhodococcus strains.   
In this study, we 
overexpressed four carotenoid 
genes - crtB, crtE, crtI, and dxs- 
individually in R. erythropolis 
AN12.  This method allowed us to 
assess whether the amount of 
enzyme available is a significant 
controlling factor for the 
carotenoid pathway in 
Rhodococcus.

Materials and Methods 
 

All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless 
otherwise noted.  All DNA-modifying enzymes and associated buffers were purchased 
from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), unless otherwise noted. 
 

Bacterial Strains and Plasmids 
All bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1.  All cell 
cultures were grown in LB broth (5 g/L yeast extract, 5 g/L sodium chloride, 10 g/L 
tryptone, pH 7.5) with appropriate antibiotics, unless otherwise noted.  E. coli cultures 
were grown at 37°C.  Rhodococcus cultures were grown at 30°C.  Kanamycin (Kan) was 
added at a concentration of 100 mg/L to cultures that contained pCR2.1-TOPO plasmids 
or its derivatives.  Spectinomycin (Spec) was added at a concentration of 100 mg/L to 
cultures containing pJP10 or its derivatives.  Frozen stocks were made of each bacterial 
strain by adding 0.8 mL 40% glycerol to 0.8 mL of cell culture and storing at -80°C. 
 
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) 
PCR was performed using the primers shown in Table 2.  They were all 
purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA).  The PCR reaction 
consisted of 10 µL 10x PCR buffer, 20 µL Q-solution, 2 µL dNTP mix (10 mM each 
dNTP), 1 µL R. erythropolis AN12 genomic DNA, 1 µL 5’ primer (100 mM), 1 µL 3’ 
primer (100 mM), 0.5 µL Hot Star Taq (2.5 units), and 64.5 µL distilled water.  PCR 
buffer, Q-solution, dNTP mix, and Hot Star Taq were all purchased from Qiagen Inc. 
(Valencia, CA).  The PCR reaction was heated to 95°C for 15 minutes to activate the Hot 
Star Taq.  The reaction was then put through 35 cycles of 95°C for 30 seconds, 52°C for 
30 seconds, and 72°C for 2 minutes and 30 seconds.  After completion of the cycles, the 
reaction stayed at 72°C for an additional 10 minutes.  The amplified reaction was stored 
at 4°C until use.   
 
Agarose Gel Electrophoresis and Gel Purification 
All agarose gels were run in 1% agarose (ISC Bioexpress; Kaysville, UT) in 1x 
TAE buffer (10x TAE was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA)).  The gel was 
stained with 0.5 µg/mL ethidium bromide.  Loading dye (15% Ficoll, 0.1% Bromphenol 
Blue, 0.1% Xylene Cyanol) was added to the samples at a concentration of 0.3 µL per 1 
µL of sample.  The samples were run at 100 V in 1x TAE buffer.  The size standard used 
was the 1 kb Ladder from New England Biolabs.  The DNA was extracted and purified 
from the gels using the GeneClean II Kit (Bio101; La Jolla, CA), following the 
manufacturer’s instructions.

TOPO Cloning 
PCR products were inserted into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector and transformed into 
E. coli One Shot Top10 chemically competent cells using reagents and protocols 
provided by Invitrogen.   
 
Plasmid Purification 
Plasmids from E. coli cultures of less than 10 mLs were purified using 
Perfectprep Plasmid Mini Kits (Eppendorf; Westbury, NY), following the manufacturer’s 
instructions.  Plasmids from larger E. coli cell cultures (200 mL) were purified using the 
Wizard Plus Maxiprep from Promega (Madison, WI), according to accompanying 
instructions. 
 
Sequence Verification 
Sequencing reactions were carried out by the MIT Biopolymers Lab, using ABI 
Prism Big Dye v. 3.0 on an AB 3700 Capillary Automated Sequencer (both from Applied 
Biosystems; Foster City, CA).  The sequencing reactions were prepared according to MIT 
Biopolymers Lab specifications.  Analysis was performed using BLAST software 
(Altschul et al, 1990). 
 
Ligation and Transformation of Plasmids 
Ligations were performed using T4 ligase and the instructions provided by New 
England Biolabs.  Transformations into E. coli XL1-Blue electrocompetent cells were 
performed by adding 2 µL ligated DNA to 40 µL thawed cells.  The transformations sat 
on ice for 5 minutes before being electroporated at 2.5 kV, 25 µF and 200 Ω using a Bio-
Rad Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad; Hercules, CA).  They were then recovered in 300 µL SOC 
(Invitrogen) and placed at 37°C for 1 hour.  All transformations were then plated on LB 
Kan agar plates and returned to 37°C.  Transformations into R. erythropolis AN12 were 
performed by adding 3 µL plasmid DNA to 70 µL thawed cells.  The transformations sat 
on ice for 5 minutes.  They were then electroporated at 2.5 kV, 25 µF and 400 Ω.  They 
were recovered with 300 µL NBYE (8 g/L nutrient broth (Difco; Detroit, MI), 5 g/L 
Bacto yeast extract (Difco)) and placed at 30°C for 2 hours.  The transformations were 
then plated on LB Spec agar plates and returned to 30°C.   
 
Electrocompetent R. erythropolis AN12 cells 
A 10 mL culture of R. erythropolis AN12 was grown in LB at 30°C.  100 µL of 
this culture was used to inoculate 200 mL NBYE with 0.05% Tween-80.  This culture 
was grown at 30°C until the OD(600nm) was between 0.8 and 1.0.  The cells were 
pelleted by spinning them at 6000RPM for 5 minutes.  The pellet was resuspended in 30 
mL ice-cold water and pelleted again as before.  The pellet was again resuspended in ice-
cold water and pelleted.  The pellet was washed with 10 mL ice-cold 10% glycerol and 
centrifuged at 8000RPM for 5 minutes.  The final cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of 
ice-cold 10% glycerol.  The cells were aliquoted and stored at –80°C.   
 
Genomic DNA Preparation 
A 10 mL overnight culture of cells was grown in LB.  The cells were pelleted by 
spinning at 6000 RPM for 5 minutes.  The pellet was frozen at –20°C for one hour.  The 

 

5

pellet was resuspended in 250 µL lysozyme (10 mg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich) in TE (10 mM 
TrisHCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0).  20 µL mutanolysin (1 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) was 
added, and the reaction was shaken at 37°C for one hour.  50 µL 0.5M EDTA, 50 µL 
10% SDS, and 50 µL 5M sodium chloride were added, and the mixture was gently 
shaken to mix.  10 µL proteinase K (20 mg/mL) was added, and the reaction was then 
incubated at 37°C for 1 hour.  50 µL sodium perchlorate solution (1g/mL) was added to 
the cell slurry, which was then mixed gently.  The DNA was extracted with one volume 
of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1).  The slurry was then mixed well and 
centrifuged for 5 minutes in a microcentrifuge.  The aqueous phase was extracted with 
0.5 volumes chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1).  The mixture was then spun down in the 
microcentrifuge for 5 minutes.  To the aqueous phase, 1 volume of isopropanol was 
added.  This mixture was then centrifuged for 15 minutes in the microcentrifuge.  The 
DNA was washed with 70% ethanol.  The pellet was then dried and resuspended in 200 
µL TE.  The DNA was stored at 4°C. 
 
Carotenoid Extraction 
200 mL cultures of R. erythropolis AN12 were grown in medium-rare defined 
medium (1.4 g/L (NH4)2SO4, 1.0 g/L MgSO4-7H20, 0.015 g/L CaCl2-2H2O, 1 g/L MOPS, 
0.5 mg/L FeSO4-7H2O, 0.4 mg/L ZnSO4-7H2O, 0.02 mg/L MnSO4-H2O, 0.015 mg/L 
H3BO3, 0.01 mg/L NiCl2-6H2O, 0.25 mg/L EDTA, 0.05 mg/L CoCl2-6H2O, 0.005 mg/L 
CuCl2-2H2O, 2.0 mg/L NaMoO4-2H2O, 5.0 mg/L FeNa-EDTA, 3.98 g/L K2HPO4 and 
1.65 g/L KH2PO4) with 1 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and 
appropriate antibiotics.  10 mLs of the culture was spun down at 6500 RPM for 5 
minutes.  The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of 1 M phosphate buffer (113 g/L 
K2HPO4, 47 g/L KH2PO4), transferred to an eppendorf tube, and spun down in a 
microcentrifuge for 5 minutes at 14000 RPM.  The supernatant was discarded, and the 
wet weight of the pellet was determined.  The pellet was resuspended in 5 mL/g methanol 
and spun down for 5 minutes at 14000 RPM.  The supernanant was removed and stored 
in foil.  The methanol extraction was performed 4 more times, saving the supernatants in 
separate tubes.  The A(462 nm) was measured of each sample.  The fractions were then 
pooled, filter-sterilized, and the A(462 nm) was measured of the pool.  The volume of the 
pool was measured, and the milligrams of carotenoids were determined by the following 
formula: 
 
mg carotenoids= Volumepool* A(462 nm)pool*1000/25000 
 
Results 
 

Four expression vectors were created that individually expressed the dxs, crtE, 
crtI, and crtB genes.  The expression vectors were then transformed into R. erythropolis 
AN12 and induced to express their respective genes.  Carotenoid extractions were then 
carried out on the transformants.  
  
Generation of PCR Products  
Primers were designed to flank the sequences of the targeted genes’ open reading 
frames.  The open reading frames were provided by Phil Lessard (MIT Biology 

 

6

Department).   Each primer to be used for PCR had an added restriction enzyme digest 
site (the flanking restriction enzyme site) on the 5’ end of the primer (Table 2).  PCR was 
then performed using the appropriate primer pairs.  The template for the PCR reactions 
was R. erythropolis AN12 genomic DNA, which was extracted by a genomic preparation.  
The PCR products were then run on an agarose gel and expected band sizes were viewed 
(Figure 2). 
 
Generation and Verification of pTOPO Plasmids 
 
The PCR products were purified from the agarose gel on which they had been 
run.  A TOPO-cloning was then performed on each separate PCR product.  The TOPO-
cloning reactions were transformed into chemically-competent TOP10 cells and plated 
onto LB Kan plates with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal).  
White colonies, which had interrupted lacZ genes because of an insertion, were picked 
and minipreparations were performed.  Three restriction enzymes digests were performed 
to verify that the expected PCR products had been incorporated into the pCR2.1-TOPO 
vector.  The EcoRI digest was performed on all plasmids, in order to check the size of the 
insert, as EcoRI sites flank the insert site on pCR2.1-TOPO (Figures 3 and 4).  To further 
evaluate these plasmids, two additional restriction enzymes digests were performed in 
each case, in which the restriction enzymes cut the expected insert.  Maxipreparations 
were then performed on all samples that appeared correct after the three verification 
digests.  These samples were again verified by three appropriate restriction enzyme 
digests.  Maxipreparation samples that appeared correct were then sequenced and verified 
by comparing them to the provided sequence (data not shown).

Generation and Verification of Expression Vectors 
 
In order to create the expression vectors to be transformed into R. erythropolis 
 
AN12, the purified pTOPO plasmids, which were obtained by maxipreparation, were 
digested with the two flanking restriction enzymes except in the case of dxs.  pTOPO-dxs 
was digested with SpeI and PstI.  The maxipreparation protocol was performed on E. coli 
strain JM109 (pJP10) to purify the expression vector, pJP10.  A sample of pJP10 was 
digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes that had been used to cut the 
pTOPO-derivative plasmids.  The digests were run on an agarose gel and appropriate 
bands were excised (data not shown). The purified fragments were then ligated.   
The ligated plasmids were transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue cells and grown on 
 
LB Spec plates to select for spectinomycin resistance.  Colonies that grew were then 
picked and minipreparations were performed.  The plasmids were verified by three 
restriction enzyme digests, including digestion with both of the restriction enzymes used 
to create the plasmids (this digest will be referred to as the dropout digest from this point 
on).  Plasmids that produced the expected fragments in all of the minipreparation 
verification digests were then isolated on a larger scale via the maxipreparation protocol .  
Three restriction enzymes digests, including the dropout digest (Figure 5), verified the 
composition of plasmids recovered from the maxipreparations (Figure 6).

Expression in R. Erythropolis AN12 
Electrocompetent R. erythropolis AN12 cells were transformed with the pJP10-
derivative plasmids.  Transformants were selected using the spectinomycin resistance of 
the pJP10-derivative plasmids.  We then performed the genomic preparation procedure 
on selected colonies.  Verification restriction digests were performed on the genomic 
DNA, along with genomic DNA from untransformed R. erythropolis AN12 DNA (Figure 
7).   

Genomic preparation samples were also verified by plasmid rescue, which 
consisted of transforming XL1-Blue competent cells with samples of genomic DNA 
isolated from the candidate R. erythropolis AN12 transformants.  The cells were plated 
on LB Spec plates, to select for spectinomycin resistance, and plasmids were recovered 
via the minipreparation protocol.  The plasmids were digested with three restriction 
enzymes and verified by comparing the resulting bands on an agarose gel to those of 
similarly-digested reference plasmids with which the R. erythropolis AN12 cells had 
originally been transformed (data not shown).

Carotenoid Extraction of R. erythropolis 
AN12 Transformants 
 
Carotenoid extractions were 
performed on three 120-hour cultures of 
each successful R. erythropolis AN12 
transformants carrying either of pJP10-I, 
pJP10-E or pJP10-dxs.  One carotenoid 
extraction was performed each on an 
unaltered pJP10 transformant in R. 
erythropolis AN12 and a pJP10-B 
transformant (Figure 8).  The pJP10-dxs 
transformants had a marked increase of 
accumulated carotenoids when compared 
to the control [AN12(pJP10)].  Similarly, 
the pJP10-E transformants appeared to 
have increased carotenoid accumulation, 
when evaluated against that of the pJP10 
transformant.  Neither the pJP10-B 
transformant nor the pJP10-I 
transformants showed a convincing 
difference in accumulated carotenoids 
from the control.

Discussion 
 

Very little is known about the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in Rhodococcus.  
While we know that Rhodococcus has all the genes of the pathway, practically nothing 
else is known about the regulatory mechanisms that control carotenoid accumulation.  
We are trying to study these regulatory mechanisms by overexpressing the dxs, crtE, 
crtB, and crtI genes and gauging the contribution each corresponding enzyme has on the 
total carotenoid accumulation.  From our results, we found that overexpression of crtE 
and overexpression of dxs had strong effects on carotenoid accumulation. 
When dxs was overexpressed, we saw a greater than two fold increase in 
 
accumulated carotenoids.  As the gateway gene to the isoprenoid pathway, dxs is 
suspected to have the greatest effect on carotenoid production out of the four genes in this 
study, because more carotenoids could potentially be formed by increasing the precursor 
molecules.  As observed by Kostichka et al (2003), overexpression of the R. erythropolis 

 

11

AN12 dxs has been performed in R. erythropolis CW23 and overall carotenoid 
production was doubled.  Our results coincide quite accurately with these results, which 
shows that the results can be repeated, even under rather different circumstances, as 
separate carotenoid extraction methods and strains were used.  Matthews and Wurtzel 
(2000) saw a greater than 10 fold increase of total carotenoids when dxs was 
overexpressed with crtE, crtI, and crtB in E. coli, when compared to just crtE, crtI, and 
crtB.  Similarly, Lois et al. (2000) observed a strong correlation between dxs 
overexpression and carotenoid synthesis in plants.  All of these sources, along with our 
own data, support that carotenoid synthesis regulation is, to some extent, controlled by 
the amount of enzyme present in the cell, as seen in plants and bacteria.    
The crtE transformant increased the carotenoids approximately two fold.  The 
 
increase caused by crtE is somewhat surprising.  In bacteria, crtE is not the committed 
step in the carotenoid pathway, as GGPP is also used for diterpenes and 
geranylgeranylated proteins (Math et al., 1992).  This concept, however, shows similarity 
to dxs, as DOXP synthase does not catalyze a committed step to carotenoid production, 
but a marked increase in carotenoid accumulation was still observed in many cases (Lois 
et al., 2000; Matthews and Wurtzel, 2000; Kostichka et al., 2003).  By expressing crtE 
and a construct containing crtI, crtB, crtY, crtZ and crtW, Wang et al (1999) saw 
increased carotenoid expression over the 5-gene constructs and proposed that crtE was 
the first rate-controlling step for carotenoid production in E. coli.  This finding would 
suggest that overexpressing crtE would have a greater effect than overexpressing the 
genes farther down the pathway, which coincides with our observations.   
In contrast to dxs and crtE, neither crtI nor crtB appeared to have an evident 
 
effect, at least not within our conditions and our sample size.  The committed step to the 
carotenoid pathway is phytoene synthase, crtB, so we would expect a noticeable increase 
in carotenoids produced.  In this respect, our result was unexpected, in that there was no 
marked increase in carotenoid accumulation, when compared to the control.  By 
overexpressing the endogenous phytoene synthase gene, crtB, Lindgren et al (2003) 
observed a significant increase in the total carotenoid content in Arabidopsis.  Like R. 
erythropolis, Arabidopsis naturally produces carotenoids, so it is possible that this result 
should carry over to Rhodococcus, but our result does not seem to coincide with this idea.  
However, carotenoid extraction was only performed once on the pJP10-B transformant, 
so this may be reflect an artifact of the small sample size.  Also, the product of phytoene 
synthase, phytoene, is not pigmented (Armstrong, 1994), so the transformant may be 
accumulating phytoene, but we were just unable to quantify it by our spectrophotometric 
method.  Although other carotenoid genes, such as crtI, crtO and crtY, are farther down 
the carotenoid pathway, they are still likely candidates for increasing carotenoid 
production.  The phytoene desaturase gene, crtI, which is also known as lycopene 
synthase, has been overexpressed in Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous (Verdoes et al, 
2003).  In this case, a decrease in total carotenoids was observed.  It is important to 
mention that a major shift in the distribution of individual carotenoid production was 
noted in this system, indicating that overexpressing the crtI gene may still act as a 
limiting factor for the latter part of the pathway.  The distribution shift viewed by 
Verdoes et al. (2003) could be occurring in AN12(pJP10-I), as we did not distinguish the 
individual carotenoids that were formed.

Based on our results, the carotenoid pathway in Rhodococcus seems homologous 
to many of the pathways studied.  This similarity suggests that the regulatory mechanism 
for the carotenoid pathway is controlled, in part, by the concentration of enzymes in the 
cell, and that the pathway can be manipulated by overexpressing the carotenoid genes.  In 
order to have a more complete study of the enzymatic regulation of the carotenoid 
pathway in R. erythropolis AN12, overexpressing other genes of the carotenoid pathway, 
such as crtY and crtO, in the same manner, would be useful.  Similarly, overexpressing 
multiple genes in one cell, especially crtE and dxs, would provide us with a more 
thorough understanding of the carotenoid pathway genes.  This process could be 
performed by using multiple expression vectors, with different selectable markers, or by 
inserting multiple genes into a single expression vector.  Ravanello et al. (2003) saw an 
increase in carotenoid expression in when a three-gene construct containing crtB, crtI and 
crtY was overexpressed in Brassica napus.  This increase was markedly greater than 
solely overexpressing crtB.  This observation would suggest that overexpressing multiple 
carotenoid genes would permit greater carotenoid accumulation in Rhodococcus as well. 
Despite these observations, it is clear that our research should be continued using 
more samples, so that statistical observations could be made on the carotenoids 
accumulated by transformants.  In addition, the IPTG-responsiveness of the trc promoter 
in R. erythropolis AN12 was never determined in this study.  While our data may suggest 
that overexpressing certain carotenoid genes increases overall carotenoid production, the 
level of overexpression of the encoded enzymes has not been directly determined.  Thus, 
perhaps another expression vector would have allowed for a greater increase of 
carotenoids. Furthermore, the plasmids we have created can be used as tools to express 
multiple genes at a time in R. erythropolis AN12.  The flanking restriction sites have 
been designed so that two genes can fit into the expression vector at a time. 
Most bacterial carotenoid expression studies have been performed in E. coli 
(Wang et al., 1999; Matthews and Wurtzel, 2000), which has no natural carotenoid 
pathway (Gallagher et al., 2003).  Thus, in order to study carotenoid accumulation in E. 
coli, the entire carotenoid pathway must be introduced.  By looking at Rhodococcus 
instead of E. coli, we can explore the native carotenoid pathway, studying how the 
regulatory mechanisms interact with carotenoid accumulation in the cell. Given that the 
AN12 strain of R. erythropolis possesses the genes required for carotenoid synthesis and 
that this strain accumulates less carotenoids than many of its relatives, it seems 
reasonable that further genetic manipulation of this strain might unlock its biosynthetic 
potential.  Continuation of this work may even allow Rhodococcus to accumulate higher 
levels of carotenoids than can more familiar genetically-modified hosts, such as E. coli.
