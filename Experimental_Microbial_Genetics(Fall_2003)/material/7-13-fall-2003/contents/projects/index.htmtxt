THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE
This section aims to illustrate how the course unfolds throughout the semester
and includes examples of the following: project andÂ writing assignments,
materials designed to help students get started with their research process,
feedback documents on student writing assignments and presentations, and an
actualÂ student final paper.
INTRODUCTION:Â Launching into the Student Projects "Hit the ground,
running..."Â 
At the beginning of the course, students are presented with a list of projects
and are asked to choose a subset of those that interest them from the list. In
order to have a diverse set of projects per term,Â Dr. Lessard makes the final
project assignments based on initial student interest.
     Dr. Lessard: In the past, criteria students have used to make their
     initial project selectionsÂ included random selection, a desire to
     try something new or desireÂ to avoid, at all costs, a specific
     topic,Â or to work on something they are familiar with.
Students work in groups of two on a selected project to foster the spirit of
collaboration in the group investigative effort while sharing laboratory work
and responsibilities with others in the class. While choosing project
assignments, a flowchart is provided as a general description of how the
project may unfold as the semester progresses.
     Dr. Lessard: Part of the richness and uniqueness of this course is
     that many students will find that their project will evolve quite
     differently than what was originally projected.
    * An Example Project (PDF)
Alongside laboratory work, students are required to gain a command of their
research area by reading journal articles found from literature searches using
the vast array of scientific and medical library resources on the web. To
provide a frame of reference for a selected topic, the teaching staff prepares
a suggested list of terms forÂ each student's initial literature search effort.
     Dr. Lessard: Given that most students have no prior experience to
     overcome the activation energy of getting started on a new research
     project, we provide each group with suggested keywords to use in
     theirÂ literature searches,Â as a way to get their foot in the door.
    * Example ofÂ Suggested Literature Search Terms (PDF)
Each group meets individually with the teaching staff in order to learn the
relevant hands-on laboratoryÂ details involved as well as the overall mission
and significance of their project. During this session, students also discuss
and plan a strategy and haveÂ their specific questions about the project
answered.
Student groups who are waiting for their individual session with the teaching
staff are provided with a lab TO DO listÂ that helps them get started with
their laboratory work.
     Dr. Lessard: The outcome of this meeting which takes about half an
     hour or so is that the students should feel comfortable in pursuing
     their research goals. The lab TO DO list is another jumpstart
     suggestions guide to help students get started with their projects.
     For example, this list would tell students which strains they need to
     culture and which reagents they need to prepare in anticipation of
     the first actual experiments. The purpose of the strains and reagents
     will be clear once they have had this meeting with the teaching
     staff. The bulk of the laboratory work for the rest of the semester
     is set byÂ each student group's pace.
    * Example of aÂ lab TO DO and initial goals list (PDF)
AS THE SEMESTER PROGRESSES:Â Laboratory and Communication "Setting the pace..."
Â 
Although a greater partÂ of the student's time is spent in the laboratory,
students also practice and develop their communications skillsÂ throughout the
semester.
ORAL COMMUNICATION
Early on in the term, aÂ workshop is given onÂ how to giveÂ Oral Presentations.
Students are asked to present a review of articles extracted from their
literature searches in a journal club forum with the class.
Towards the end of the term, each student group gives a progress report
presentation describing the goals of their research,Â data, and current
interpretations of the dataÂ to the class.
After eachÂ oral presentation, the teaching staff provides explicit and
personalized feedback to each student as to how they can improve their speaking
skills.
    * Example ofÂ an individualÂ feedback document (PDF)
WRITING
Dr.Â Melvold gives aÂ tutorial on the components of the scientific paper, also
early on in the term. The three interim writing assignments that are given
thereafter and throughout the term, focus on the style and content of each
specific section of a scientific research paper. They include the Introduction,
Materials &amp; Methods, Results, and Discussion sections.
After students hand in their writing assignments, Dr. Lessard and Dr. Melvold
conduct a writing workshop using student samples to illustrate common themes
and issues that students struggle with in their writing.
     Dr. Lessard: We make extensive, individualized comments on each
     student's paper for their specific benefit. Then, in the writing
     workshop, we address some of the more common problems that many
     students encounter in their papers.
    * Example Writing Workshop Material (PPS)Â 
Instructions for Viewing the Writing Workshop Material: The writing workshop
material is an interactive PowerPoint show document with a *.pps file
extension.
    * If you have MicrosoftÂ® PowerPointÂ®: double click on the file link to
      launch the presentation into a slide show view in your web browser. Use
      the right and left arrow keys or left-mouse click to walk through the
      presentation. For best results, save this file to the local computer and
      open using PowerPoint.
    * If you Don't have MicrosoftÂ® PowerPointÂ®: GoÂ hereÂ for links where you
      can download a free PowerPoint viewer for your PC or MAC.
    * The non-interactive version of the Writing Workshop Material may also be
      viewed as a PDF file. (PDF)
FINAL PAPERS
The final paper is the culmination of the three writing assignments students
have worked on over the course of the semester. Since their projects will have
evolved quite a bit, major revisions of the initial written work are to be
expected as students tailor their final paper. These areÂ expected to be in a
format suitable for publication in international scientific journals.
     Dr. Lessard: It's not as simple as a cut and paste of the three
     writing assignments into the final paper. Often the focus or
     experiments change over the course of the research process. For
     example, some students throw out their initial introductions
     andÂ write entirelyÂ new ones by the time the semester ends.
