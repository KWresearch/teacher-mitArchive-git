Two complementary devices: 

•  n-channel device (n-MOSFET) on p-substrate 

–  uses electron inversion layer 

•  p-channel device (p-MOSFET) on n-substrate

Drain  Current ( I d :proportional to inversion charge 
and the velocity that the charge travels fiom source 
to drain 
Ve loc iv :proportional to electric field fiom drain to 
source 
Gate-Source Voltage (VG& controls amount of 
inversion charge that carries the current 
Drain-Source  Voltage (V'J : controls the electric 
field that drifts the inversion charge fiom the source 
to drain 

Want to understand the relationship between the drain 
current in the MOSFET   as a function of gate-to-source 
voltage and drain-to-source voltage. 

Initially consider source tied up to body (substrate or

3.  I-V Characteristics (Assume VSB=0) 

Geometry of problem: 

All voltages are referred to the Source 

General expression of channel current 

Current can only flow in the y-direction: 

Total channel flux: 
I y  = W • QN (y) • vy (y) 
Drain current is equal to minus channel current:
 
ID  = −W • QN (y) • vy (y)

I D  = −W  • QN ( y) • v y ( y) 
Re-write equation in terms of voltage at location y, V(y): 

•  If electric field is not too high: 
v y ( y ) = −µµµµn • E y ( y ) = µµµµn  • dV 
dy 

•  For QN(y), use charge-control relation at location y: 
] 
[ 
QN ( y) = −C ox  VGS  − V ( y) − VT
for VGS  – V(y) ≥ VT. . 
Note that we assumed that VT  is independent of y. 
See discussion on body effect in Section 4.4 of text. 

All together the drain current is given by: 
[ 
ID  = W • µµµµnCox  VGS  − V ( y) − VT

]• dV ( y ) 
dy 

Simple linear first order differential equation with one 
un-known, the channel voltage V(y).

Solve by separating variables:

]• dV 

Integrate along the channel in the linear regime subject 
the boundary conditions : 
- Source: y=0, V(0)=0 
- Drain: y=L, V(L)=VDS  (linear regime)

Key dependencies: 

•  VDS↑ →  ID↑ (higher lateral electric field) 
•  VGS↑ →  ID↑ (higher electron concentration) 

This is the linear or triode region: 
It is linear if VDS<<VGS-VT

Two important observations 

1.	  Equation only valid if VGS  – V(y) ≥ VT  at every y. 
Worst point is y=L, where V(y) = VDS, hence, 
equation is valid if 

VDS  ≤ VGS  − VT

Two important observations 
2.	  As VDS  approaches VGS  – VT, the rate of increase of 
ID  decreases. 

Reason: 
 
As y increases down the channel, V(y) ↑, |QN(y)| ↓, and
 
Ey(y) ↑ (fewer carriers moving faster) 
 
⇒  inversion layer thins down from source to drain 
⇒ ID  grows more slowly.

Drain Current Saturation 

As VDS  approaches 
VDSsat  = VGS  − VT 

increase in E y  compensated by decrease in |QN| 
⇒ ID  saturates when |QN| equals 0 at drain end. 

Value of drain saturation current: 
IDsat  = I Dlin (VDS  = VDSsat  = VGS  − VT )
