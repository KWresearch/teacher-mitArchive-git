1.  Overview of MOS electrostatics 
under bias 

Application of bias: 

•  Built-in potential across MOS structure increases 
from φB  to φB  + VGB 
•  Oxide forbids current flow ⇒ 
–  J=0 everywhere in semiconductor 
–  Need drift = ­diffusion in SCR 
•  Must maintain boundary condition at Si/SiO2 
interface 
–  E ox  / Es  ≈ 3 
How can this be accommodated simultaneously? ⇒ 
quasi­equilibrium situation with potential build-up 
across MOS equal to φB  + VGB

Important consequence of quasi­equilibrium:


⇒ Boltzmann relations apply in semiconductor


[they were derived starting from Jn  = J p  =0]


n(x ) = ni e qφφφφ(x )  kT 
− qφφφφ( x)  kT 
p(x ) = ni e

2. Depletion regime 

For VGB>0, metal attracts electrons and repels holes 
⇒ Depletion region widens 

For VGB<0, metal repels electrons and attracts holes 
⇒ Depletion region shrinks

In depletion regime, all results obtained for thermal 
equilibrium apply if φB → φB+VGB. 

For example:

At a certain negative VGB, depletion region is wiped out 
⇒ Flatband

5. Threshold 

Back to VGB>0. 

For sufficiently large VGB>0, electrostatics change when 
n(0)=Na ⇒ threshold. 

Beyond threshold, we cannot neglect contributions of 
electrons towards electrostatics. 

Let’s compute the gate voltage (threshold voltage) that 
leads to n(0)=N . 

Key assumption: use electrostatics of depletion 
(neglect electron concentration at threshold)

Computation of threshold voltage. 
Three step process: 

First, compute potential drop in semiconductor at 
threshold. Start from: 
n(0 ) = ni eqφ( 0 )  kT 
Solve for φ(0) at VGB  = VT:


φφφφ( 0 ) 
VGB  =VT

=

kT 
q 

•  ln 

n ( 0 )

n i  VGB  = VT

=

q 

•  ln 

N
a  =  − φφφφp
n i 

Hence: 

VB (VT ) = −2φφφφp

Computation of threshold voltage (contd.) 

Second, compute potential drop in oxide at threshold. 

Obtain xd(VT) using relationship between VB  and xd  in 
depletion: 

VB (VGB  = VT ) = 

2 
VT(
qN a x d 
2εεεεs 

) 
= −2φφφφp 

Solve for xd  at VGB  = VT: 

xd (VT ) = x d max  = 

2εεεεs (−2φφφφp ) 
qN a 

Then: 

Vox (VT ) =  Eox (VT ) tox  = 

qNa xd (VT ) 
tox  =  1

2εεεεs qNa (−2φφφφp )

Finally, sum potential drops across structure. 

VT  + φφφφB  = VB (VT ) + Vox (VT ) = −2φφφφP  +  1 
Cox 

2εεεεs qNa (−2φφφφp ) 

Solve for VT: 
VGB ==== VT  ==== VFB −−−− 2φφφφP  ++++

Key dependencies:

C ox 

2εεεεs qNa (−−−−2φφφφp ) 

•  If N a  ↑↑↑↑ ⇒⇒⇒⇒ VT  ↑↑↑↑.  The higher the doping, the more 
voltage required to produce n(0) = Na 
•  If C ox  ↑↑↑↑ (tox ↓↓↓↓) ⇒⇒⇒⇒ VT  ↓↓↓↓.  The thinner the oxide, the 
less voltage dropped across the oxide.

6.  Inversion 
What happens for VGB  > VT? 

More electrons at Si/SiO2  interface than acceptors 
⇒⇒⇒⇒ inversion. 

Electron concentration at Si/SiO2  interface modulated 
by VGB ⇒  VGB  ↑ → n(0) ↑ → |QN| ↑ : 
Field­effect control of mobile charge density! 
[essence of MOSFET] 

Want to compute QN  vs. VGB  [charge­control relation] 

Make sheet charge approximation: electron layer at 
Si/SiO2  is much thinner than any other dimension in 
problem (tox, xd).

Charge­Control Relation 

To derive the charge­control relation, let’s look at 
the overall electrostatics: 

6.012 Spring 2009

Charge­Control Relation (contd.) 

Key realization: 
n(0) ∝ e qφφφφ(0 )  kT 
qN a x d  ∝  φφφφ(0) 

Hence, as VGB  ↑ and φ(0) ↑ , n(0) will change a lot, but

|Qd| will change very little.


Several consequences: 

•	 xd  does not increase much beyond threshold: 
2εεεεs (−2φφφφp ) 
qNa 

xd (inv.) ≈ xd (VT ) = 

=	 xd ,max

•	 VB  does not increase much beyond VB(VT) =-2φP 
(a thin sheet of electrons does not contribute much to 
VB.): 

VB (inv.) ≈ VB (VT ) = −2φφφφP

Charge­Control Relation (contd..) 

•	 All extra voltage beyond VT  used to increase 
inversion charge Qn. Think of it as capacitor: 
–	 Top plate: metal gate 
–	 Bottom plate: inversion layer 

Q = CV 
⇒ 
QN  = −Cox (VGB  − VT  )
