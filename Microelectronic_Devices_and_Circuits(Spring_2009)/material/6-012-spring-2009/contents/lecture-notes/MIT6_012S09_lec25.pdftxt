Characteristics of DC Voltage Sources : 

•	 A well controlled output voltage 
•	 Output voltage does not depend on current

vOUT  is a function of IREF  and W/L of MOSFET: 

IREF  ↑ ⇒ vOUT ↑

•  W/L ↑ ⇒  vOUT  ↓

Same operation and characteristics as NMOS 
voltage source. PMOS needs to be larger to attain 
the same Rout.

Characteristics of Current Sources 

•	 A well controlled output current 
•	 Supplied current does not depend on output

voltage ⇒ High Norton Resistance

3.  Multiple Current Sources 
Since there is no DC gate current in MOSFET, we 
can tie up multiple current mirrors to single current 
source:

IOUTn  =  IREF

Multiple Current Sources and 
Sinks 
Often, in a given circuit, we need current sources 
and sinks. We can build them all out of a single 
current source. 

IOUT1  =  IREF 

IOUT2  =  IREF 

IOUT4  =  IOUT1

Generating  IREF

Simple circuit: 

IREF  = 

VDD  − VOUT
R 

VOUT  = VTn  + 

IREF
W 
µµµµnCox 
2 L 

For large W/L: 

IREF  ≈ VDD − VTn 
R 

•  Advantages 
–  IREF  set by value of resistor 
•  Disadvantages 
–  VDD  also affects IREF. 
–  VTn  and R are functions of  temperature ⇒ IREF(T). 

In the real world, more sophisticated circuits are 
used to generate IREF  that are VDD  and T 
independent.

Summary of Key Concepts


•	 Voltage source easily synthesized from 
reference current source using MOSFET  in 
diode configuration 
•	 Current source easily synthesized from current 
source using current mirror circuit. 
•	 Multiple current sources and sinks with different

magnitudes can be synthesized from a single 
current source.
