Physics of reverse bias: 

•	 Potential drop across SCR increased by V

–  ⇒ minority carrier extraction from QNRs

•	 Minority carrier diffusion through QNRs 
•	 Minority carrier generation at surfaces & contacts 
of QNRs 
•	 Very small supply of carriers available for 
extraction

–  ⇒ I saturates to small value

Development of analytical current model: 

1.  Calculate the concentration of minority carriers at 
edges of SCR; 

2.  Find the spatial distribution of the minority carrier 
concentrations in each QNR; 

3.  Calculate minority carrier diffusion current at SCR 
edge. 

4.  Sum minority carrier electron and hole diffusion 
currents at SCR edge.

Ink Diffusion Example 

•  Flux is number of ink molecules passing a plane/cm2­sec 
•  No molecules vanish in the water (NO recombination) 
Ink concentration is a constant at x = 0 
• 
Ink concentration is zero at x = W (ohmic contact) 
• 
•  Result ­ Ink concentration falls linearly from x=0 to x=W

Minority Carrier Spatial Distribution 
( Reverse Bias) 

•  Diode current derivation same for forward and 
reverse bias. (same equations for spatial distribution) 
•  Minority carrier concentration at SCR is near zero 
under reverse bias. 
•  Concentration linearly increases from SCR edge to 
ohmic contact. 
•  Minority carriers flow from contacts to SCR and are 
swept across the junction.

•	 Diode Current can be analytically 
determined by summing the minority 
carrier current at both sides of SCR

I =  Io (e	

•	 Under forward bias: 
–	 Minority carriers are injected across the 
junction and diffuse to the contact where they 
recombine 
•	 Under reverse bias: 
–  Minority carriers are generated at the contact

and diffuse to the junction where they are

extracted across the junction
