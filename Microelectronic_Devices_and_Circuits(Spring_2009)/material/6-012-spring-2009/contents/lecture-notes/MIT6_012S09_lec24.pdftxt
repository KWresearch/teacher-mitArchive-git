1. Introduction
Most often, single stage amplifier does not accomplish 
design goals:

• Need more gain than could be provided by a single 
stage
• Need to adapt to specified RS and RL to maximize 
efficiency

⇒ Multistage amplifier

VBIAS

Issues:
• What amplifying stages should be used and in what 
order?
• What devices should be used, BJT or MOSFET?
• How is biasing to be done?

2. CMOS Multistage Voltage Amplifier

Goals:

• High voltage gain, Avo
• High input resistance, Rin
• Low output resistance, Rout

Good starting point: Common-Source stage:

• Rin=∞
• Avo=-gm(ro//roc), probably insufficient
• Rout= (ro//roc), too high

CMOS Multistage Voltage Amplifier (contd.)

Add second CS stage to get more gain:

• Rin=∞
• Avo=gm1(ro1//roc1) gm2(ro2//roc2)
• Rout= (ro2//roc2), still too high

Add CD stage at output (to reduce Rout):

•

• Rin=∞
(
Avo = gm1 ro1 || roc1

Rout =
g m3 + g mb3

3.  BiCMOS multistage voltage amplifier 

Avo(CE) > Avo(CS) because gm(BJT) > gm(MOSFET), but..
CS stage is best first stage, since Rin=∞.

How about adding a CE stage following the CS stage?

However, inter-stage loading degrades gain:
Rout 1 = ro1 || roc1 >> Rin2 = rπ2

There is a voltage divider between stages

Rout 1 + Rin2
Additional gain provided by the CE stage is mostly lost 
to inter-stage loading.

Inter-stage loading:

Then, inter-stage loss:
)
(
rπ3 +βo3 ro3 || roc3 || RL
Rin3
(
Rout 2 + Rin3
ro2 || roc 2 + rπ3 +βo 3 ro3 || roc 3 || RL
Better than trying to use a CE stage, but still pretty bad.
The good thing is that Rout has improved:
Rout 2
ro 2 || roc 2

Rout = Rout 3 =

Since, in general gm(BJT) > gm(MOSFET), Rout could be 
better than CD output stage if ro2||roc2 is not too large. 
Otherwise, CD output stage is better.

Better voltage buffer: cascade CC and CD output stages

4. BiCMOS current buffer

Goals:

• Unity current gain, Ai=1
• Very low input resistance, Rin
• Very high output resistance, Rout

Start with a common-base stage:

• Aio = −1
1
• Rin =
g m
{
}
[
]
(
)
• R out = roc || ro 1 + g m rπ|| RS
Note that if RS is “high enough”, Rout ≈ roc||(βoro).

Can we increase Rout further by adding a second CB 
stage?

Plugging in Rout1 ≈ roc1|| (βo1roc1).
{
[
(
Rout = roc 2 || ro2 1 + g m2 rπ2 || roc1 ||βo1ro1
But, since rπ2 << roc1|| (β1roc1), then
]≈ roc2 || βo2 ro2
[
)
(
(
Rout = roc2 || ro2 1 + gm2 rπ2
Did not improve anything! The base current limits the 
number of CB stages that can improve the output 
resistance to just one.
Since the CG stage has no gate current, cascade it with 
the CB stage

Rout = roc 2 || ro2 gm 2 roc1 ||βo1ro1
Now Rout has improved by about gm2ro2, but only to 
the extent that roc2 is high enough…

5. Coupling Amplifier Stages
CAPACITIVE COUPLING

Capacitors that have large enough value behave as AC 
short, so the signal goes through but bias is independent 
for each stage.

Example, CD-CC voltage buffer:

5.0 V

5.0 V

4.0 V

2.5 V

ISUP1

3.2 V

ISUP2

2.5 V

 = 0.7 V
Assumes VBE
 = 1.5 V
VGS

• Advantages
– Can select bias point for optimum operation
– Can select bias point close to the mid-point of the 
power rails for maximum voltage swing
• Disadvantages
– To approximate AC short, large capacitors are needed 
and they consume large area.

6.012 Spring 2009

Lecture 24

Coupling Amplifier Stages (contd.)
DIRECT COUPLING: share bias points across stages.
Example, CD-CC voltage buffer:

5.0 V

5.0 V

4.7 V

ISUP1

3.2 V

ISUP2

2.5 V

 = 0.7 V
Assumes VBE
 = 1.5 V
VGS

• Advantages
– No capacitors needed
– compact
• Disadvantages
– Bias point shared:constrains designs.
– Bias shifts from stage to stage and can stray too far 
from center of range
– Generally requires level shifting to bring signal back 
to center of range.

Summary of Key Concepts

•

• To achieve design goals, multistage amplifiers are 
often needed
In multistage amplifiers, different stages are used to 
accomplish different goals
– Voltage gain: common-source, common emitter
– Voltage buffer: common drain, common collector
– Current buffer: common gate, common base
In multistage amplifiers, attention must be paid  to 
inter-stage loading to avoid unnecessary losses
– Must select compromise bias,
– Must pay attention to bias shift from stage to stage
