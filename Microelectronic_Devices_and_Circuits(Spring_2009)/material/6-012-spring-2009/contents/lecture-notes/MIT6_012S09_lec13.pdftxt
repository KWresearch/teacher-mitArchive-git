and output signals; figure of merit of logic speed. 

Typical propagation delays: < 100 ps.

Key dependencies of propagation delay: 

•  VDD  ↑ ⇒ tp  ↓ 
–  Reason: VDD  ↑ ⇒ Q(CL  ) ↑, but ID  goes as square↑ 
–  Trade-off: VDD  ↑ ⇒ more power consumed. 
• L ↓ ⇒ t  ↓

–  Reason: L ↓ ⇒ I  ↑D 
–  Trade-off: manufacturing cost!

Gate Capacitance of Next Stage
 

• Estimation of the input capacitance: 
• n- and p-channel transistors in the next stage 
switch from triode through saturation to cutoff 
during a high-low or low-high transition 

• Requires nonlinear charge storage elements to 
accurately model 

• Hand Calculation use a rough estimate for an inverter 
Cin  = Cox (WL ) p  + C ox (WL )n 
 

CG for example circuit 
CG  = C ox (WL ) p 2  + Cox (WL)n2  + 
Cox (WL) p3  + Cox (WL)n3

The p+ layer (i.e., heavily doped with acceptors) under 
the thick thermal oxide (500 nm = 0.5  pm) and deposited 
oxide (600 nm = 0.6 pm) depletes only slightly when 
positive voltages appear on the metal line, so the 
capacitance is approximately the oxide capacitance: 

where the oxide thickness = 500 nm + 600 nm = 1.1 pm. 

(  For large digital systems, the parasitic wiring capacitance 
can dominate the load capacitance

Calculation of Parasitic Drain/Bulk Junction 
Depletion Capacitance 

• Depletion qJ(vD) is non-linear --> take the worst case and use the zero-
bias capacitance Cjo  as a linear charge-storage element during the transient. 

• “Bottom” of depletion regions of the inverter’s drain diffusions 
contribute a depletion capacitance: 

CJBOT  = CJn(WnLdiffn) + CJp(WpLdiffp) 

Where: CJn  and CJp  are the zero-bias bottom capacitance (fF/µm2) for the 
n-channel and p-channel MOSFET drain-bulk junction, respectively. 

Typical numbers: CJn  and CJp  are about 0.2 fF/µm2 

• “Sidewall” of depletion regions of the inverter’s drain diffusions make an 
additional contribution: 

CJSW  = (Wn  + 2Ldiffn)CJSWn  + (Wp  + 2Ldiffp)CJSWp 

Where: CJSWn  and CJSWp  are the zero-bias sidewall capacitance (F/µm) for 
the n-channel and p-channel MOSFET drain-bulk junction, respectively. 

Typical numbers: CJSWn  and CJSWp  are about 0.5 fF/µm 

The sum of CJBOT  and CJSW  is the total depletion capacitance, CDB

Power Dissipation 
 

• Energy from power supply needed to charge up the capacitor: 
 

2 CL
 
Ech arg e  = ∫ VDD i (t )dt = VDDQ = VDD 

• Energy stored in capacitor: 

2
Estore  = 1 / 2 CLVDD 

• Energy lost in p-channel MOSFET during charging: 

2
 
Ediss  = Ech arg e  − Estore  = 1 / 2 CLVDD 

•During discharge the n-channel MOSFET dissipates an 
identical amount of energy. 

•If the charge/discharge cycle is repeated f times/second, 
where f is the clock frequency, the dynamic power 
dissipation is: 

2
P = 2 Ediss *  f  = CLVDD  f
 

In practice many gates do not change state every clock 
cycle which lowers the power dissipation.

Summary of Key Concepts
 

Key features of CMOS inverter: 

•	  No current between power supply and ground while 
inverter is idle in any logic state 
•	  “rail-to-rail” logic 

– 	  Logic levels are 0 and VDD.  

•	  High |Av| around the logic threshold
 
–  ⇒  Good noise margins. 
 

CMOS inverter logic threshold and noise margins 
engineered through Wn/Ln  and W p/Lp. 

Key dependencies of propagation delay: 

•	  VDD  ↑ ⇒ tp  ↓ 
•	  L ↓ ⇒ t  ↓
