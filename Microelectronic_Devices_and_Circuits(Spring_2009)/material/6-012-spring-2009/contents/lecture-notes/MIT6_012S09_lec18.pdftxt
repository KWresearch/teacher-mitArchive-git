•  Forward active: device has high voltage gain and 
high β; 
•  Reverse active: poor β; not useful; 
•  Cut­off: negligible current: nearly an open circuit; 

•  Saturation: device is flooded with minority 
carriers; 
–  ⇒ takes time to get out of saturation

Saturation - The Flux Picture 
Both junctions are injecting and collecting. 
Electrons injected from emitter into base are 
collected by the collector as in Forward Active case. 
Electrons injected from collector into the base are 
collected by the emitter as in Reverse Active case. 
Holes injected into emitter recombine at ohmic 
contact as in Forward Active case. 
Holes injected into collector recombine with 
electrons in the n+ buried layer
