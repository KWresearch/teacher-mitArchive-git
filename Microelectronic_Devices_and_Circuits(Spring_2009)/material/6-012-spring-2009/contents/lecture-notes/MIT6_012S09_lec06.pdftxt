2. MOS Electrostatics in equilibrium

Idealized 1D structure: 

•	 Metal: does not tolerate volume charge 
–  ⇒ charge can only exist at its surface 
•	 Oxide: insulator and does not have volume charge 
–  ⇒ no free carriers, no dopants 
•	 Semiconductor: can have volume charge 
–  ⇒ Space charge region (SCR) 

In thermal equilibrium we assume Gate contact is 
shorted to Bulk contact. (i. e, VGB  = 0V)

For most metals on p­Si, equilibrium achieved by 
electrons flowing from metal to semiconductor and 
holes from semiconductor to metal: 

Remember: n opo=ni

Fewer holes near Si / SiO2 interface
⇒ ionized acceptors exposed (volume charge)

In semiconductor: space­charge region close Si /SiO2 
interface

In metal: sheet of charge at metal /SiO2  interface

3. MOS with applied bias VGB 

Apply voltage to gate with respect to semiconductor:


Electrostatics of MOS structure affected 
⇒ potential difference across entire structure now ≠ 0


How is potential difference accommodated?


6.012 Spring 2009 

Lecture 6

Potential difference shows up across oxide and SCR

in semiconductor 

Oxide is an insulator ⇒ no current anywhere in structure


In SCR, quasi­equilibrium situation prevails 
⇒ New balance between drift and diffusion 

•	 Electrostatics qualitatively identical to thermal 
equilibrium (but amount of charge redistribution is 
different) 
•	 np = ni

Apply VGB>0: potential difference across structure 
increases ⇒ need larger charge dipole ⇒ SCR expands into 
semiconductor substrate: 

Simple way to remember:

with VGB>0, gate attracts electrons and repels holes.

Qualitatively,  physics unaffected by application  of

VGB  >0. Use mathematical formulation in thermal

equilibrium, but:


φφφφB  → φφφφB  + VGB

φφφφB  + VGB  = VB (VGB ) + Vox (VGB )

Summary of Key Concepts


•	 Charge redistribution in MOS structure in thermal 
equilibrium 
–  SCR in semiconductor

–  ⇒⇒⇒⇒ built­in potential across MOS structure.

In most cases, we can use depletion approximation in 
semiconductor SCR 
•	 Application of voltage modulates depletion region 
width in semiconductor 
–	 No current flows
