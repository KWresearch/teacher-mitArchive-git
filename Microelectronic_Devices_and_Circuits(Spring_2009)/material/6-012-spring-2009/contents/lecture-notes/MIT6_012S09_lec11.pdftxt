1. Introduction to digital circuits: the inverter 


In digital circuits, digitally-encoded information is 

represented by means of two distinct voltage ranges:


V 

VMAX 

VOH 

VOL 

VMIN 

logic 1 

undefined � 
region 

logic 0 

The Static Deﬁnition 

•  Logic 0: 

•  Logic 1: 

VMIN   V VOL 

VOH   V VMAX 

•  Undeﬁned logic value:  VOL   V VOH 

Logic operations are performed using logic gates.

Deﬁne switching point  or logic threshold : 
• VM   input voltage for which VOUT = VIN 
–  For 0  VIN < VM   VOUT = V+ 
–  For VM < VIN   V+ 
 VOUT = 0 

Ideal inverter returns well deﬁned logical outputs (0 or

V+) even in the presence of considerable noise in VIN

(from voltage spikes, crosstalk, etc.) 

 signal is regenerated!

In a real inverter, valid logic levels deﬁned as follows: 

•  Logic 0: 
– VMIN   output voltage for which VIN = V+ 
– VOL   smallest output voltage where slope = -1 
•  Logic 1: 
– VOH   largest output voltage where slope = -1 
– VMAX   output voltage for which VIN = 0

Deﬁne: 

VIL   smallest input voltage where slope = -1 
VIH   highest input voltage where slope = -1 

If range of output values VOL to VOH  is wider than the 
range of input values VIL to VIH, then the inverter 
exhibits some noise immunity.  (|Voltage gain| > 1) 

Quantify this through noise margins.

•  Trace tangent of transfer function at VM 
–  Slope = small signal voltage gain (Av) at VM 
• VIL   intersection of tangent with VOUT = VMAX 
• VIH   intersection of tangent with VOUT = VMIN

What did we learn today?


Summary of Key Concepts


•	 Logic circuits must exhibit immunity to noise in the 
input signal 
–	 Noise margins 
•	 Logic circuits must be regenerative 
–	 Able to restore clean logic values even if input is 
noisy. 
•	 Propagation delay: time for logic gate to perform 
its function. 
•	 Concept of load line: graphical technique to 
visualize transfer characteristics of inverter. 
•	 First-order solution (by hand) of inverter ﬁgures-of-
merit easy if regions of operation  of transistor are 
correctly identiﬁed. 
•	 For more accurate solutions, use SPICE (or other 
CAD tool).
