Current balance in SCR broken: 
Jdrift  <  Jdiff 

Net diffusion current in SCR ⇒ minority carrier 
injection into QNRs. 

Carrier flow can be high because lots of minority 
carriers are injected into QNRs from the majority side.

Net drift current in SCR ⇒ minority carrier extraction 
from QNRs. 

Carrier flow is small because there are few minority 
carriers extracted from QNRs from the minority side.

Minority Carrier Concentrations: in QNR 

What happens if minority carrier concentrations in QNR 
changed from equilibrium?

Where does generation and recombination take place?
 

1. Semiconductor bulk 
2. Semiconductor surfaces & contacts 

In modern silicon pn­junction devices, surface & contact 
recombination dominates because: 

•  Prefect crystalline periodicity broken at the surface
 
–  ⇒ lots of generation and recombination centers;
 
•	  Modern devices are small
 
–  ⇒ high surface area to volume ratio. 
 

Surfaces and contacts are very active generation and 
recombination centers 
⇒ at contacts, carrier concentrations cannot deviate
 
from equilibrium: 
 

In general, it is assumed that at contacts, the rate at 
which generation/recombination takes place is infinite.

What is the barrier (Bottleneck) to current flow?
 

•	  Not generation or recombination at surfaces, 
•	  Not injection or extraction through SCR 
•	  But minority carrier diffusion through the QNRs 

Development of analytical current model:
 

1.	  Calculate the concentration of minority carriers at 
edges of SCR; 

2.	  Find the spatial distribution of the minority carrier 
concentrations in each QNR; 

3.	  Calculate minority carrier diffusion current at SCR 
edge. 

4. 	  Sum minority carrier electron and hole diffusion 
currents at SCR edge.

• The new potential barrier φj  = (φB  ­ VD) is substituted for 
the thermal equilibrium barrier to find the new minority 
carrier concentrations at the SCR edges. 

• Assume the detailed balance between drift and diffusion is 
not significantly perturbed.  This says electrons are in 
equilibrium with each other across the junction.  SAME for 
holes.

• The minority carrier concentration at the SCR is 
an exponential function of applied bias.  It changes 
one decade for every 60mV change in VD. 

• Law of the Junction is valid if minority carrier 
concentration is less than equilibrium majority 
concentration.  This condition is called Low Level 
Injection.

Voltage Dependence: 
• Forward bias (V>0): 
n p (− x p ) >> n po (− x po ) 
pn (x n ) >>  pno (x no ) 

• Lots of carriers available for injection, the higher 
V, the higher the concentration of injected carriers 
⇒ forward current can be high. 

• Minority carrier concentration is maintained at 
thermal equilibrium at the ohmic contacts.  All 
excess carriers recombine at ohmic contact.

• Reverse bias (V<0): 
n p (− x p ) << n po (− x po ) 
pn (x n ) <<  pno (x no ) 
Few carriers available for extraction 
⇒ reverse current is small. 

There is limit in reverse bias to how low minority 
carrier concentrations at SCR edge can be: zero! 

Rectification property of the pn diode arises from 
minority­carrier boundary conditions at edges of SCR.

What did we learn today? 
 

Summary of Key Concepts 

•	 

•	  Application of voltage to pn junction results in 
disruption of balance between drift and diffusion in 
SCR 
– 	  In forward bias, minority carriers are injected into 
quasi­neutral regions 
– 	  In reverse bias, minority carriers are extracted from 
the quasi­neutral regions 
In forward bias, injected minority carriers 
recombine at the surface (contacts). 
In reverse bias, extracted minority carriers are 
generated at the surface (contacts). 
•  Computation of boundary conditions across SCR
 
exploits quasi­equilibrium: balance between
 
diffusion and drift in SCR disturbed very little
