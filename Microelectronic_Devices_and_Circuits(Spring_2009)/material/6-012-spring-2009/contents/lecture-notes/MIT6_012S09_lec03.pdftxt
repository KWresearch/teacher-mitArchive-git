1. Thermal Motion 

In thermal equilibrium, carriers are not sitting still: 

•  Undergo collisions with vibrating Si atoms 
(Brownian motion) 
•  Electrostatically interact with each other and with 
ionized (charged) dopants 

Characteristic time constant of thermal motion: 
⇒⇒⇒⇒ mean free time between collisions 
ττττc  ≡ collison time [s] 
In between collisions, carriers acquire high velocity: 

−1 ] 
v th  ≡ thermal velocity [cms 

…. but get nowhere!

Characteristic length of thermal motion: 

λ ≡ mean free path [cm] 

λ = v thτ c 

Put numbers for Si at room temperature: 
−13 s 
ττττc  ≈ 10

vth  ≈ 10
⇒ λλλλ≈ 0.01 µm 

For reference, state-of-the-art production MOSFET: 
L g  ≈ 0.1 µm 
⇒  Carriers undergo many collisions as they travel 
through devices

2. Carrier Drift 

Apply electric field to semiconductor: 

E ≡≡≡≡ electric field [V cm-1] 

⇒ net force on carrier 

F = ±qE 

E 

Between collisions, carriers accelerate in the direction of 
the electrostatic field: 

v( t) = a • t  = ±  qE 
m n ,p 

t

But there is (on the average) a collision every τ c  and the 
velocity is randomized: 

net velocity� 
in direction � 
of field 

τc 

time 

The average net velocity in direction of the field: 
τ c  = ±  qτ c 
v = vd  = ±  qE 
2m n ,p 
2m n ,p 

E 

This is called drift velocity [cm s-1] 

Define: 
µn, p  =  qτ c 
2m n ,p 

Then, for electrons: 

and for holes:

Mobility - is a measure of ease  of carrier drift

If τ c  ↑, longer time between collisions ⇒ µ ↑ 
If m ↓, “lighter” particle ⇒ µ ↑

•  For low doping level, µ is limited by collisions with 
lattice. As Temp ->INCREASES; µ-> DECREASES 

•  For medium doping and high doping level, µ limited by 
collisions with ionized impurities 

•  Holes “ heavier” than electrons 
–  For same doping level, µn  > µ p

3. Carrier Diffusion 

Diffusion =  particle movement (flux) in response to 
concentration gradient 

n 

x 

Elements of diffusion: 

•  A medium (Si Crystal) 
•  A gradient of particles (electrons and holes) inside 
the medium 

•  Collisions between particles and medium send 
particles off in random directions 

–  Overall result is to erase gradient

Einstein relation 

At the core of drift and diffusion is same physics: 
collisions among particles and medium atoms 
⇒⇒⇒⇒ there should be a relationship between D and µ

µµµµn  ≈ 1000 cm 2  / V • s  ⇒ Dn  ≈ 25 cm 2  / s 
µµµµp  ≈ 400 cm 2 / V • s  ⇒ D p  ≈ 10 cm 2 / s

In general, total current can flow by drift and diffusion 
separately. Total current density:

J n  = J drift
n  = qnµnE + qD n

J p  = J drift
p  = qpµpE − qD p
