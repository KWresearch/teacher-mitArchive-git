1.  Introduction 

•  pn junction 
–  p­region and n­region in intimate contact
 

Why is the p­n junction worth studying?
 

It is present in virtually every semiconductor device!

What is the carrier concentration 
distribution in thermal equilibrium? 

First think of the two sides separately: 

Now bring the two sides together. 

What happens?

Resulting carrier concentration profile in 
thermal equilibrium: 

•	  Far away from the metallurgical junction: nothing

happens

– 	  Two quasi­neutral regions

•	  Around the metallurgical junction: diffusion of 
carriers must counter­balance drift 
– 	  Space­charge region

On a linear scale:
 

Thermal equilibrium: balance between drift and diffusion 
drift ( x ) + J n 
diff  ( x ) = 0 
J n ( x ) = J n 

drift ( x ) + J p 
diff  ( x ) = 0 
J p ( x ) = J p 
We can divide semiconductor into three regions 

•  Two quasi­neutral n­ and p­regions (QNR’s) 
•  One space­charge region (SCR) 

Now, we want to know no(x), po(x), ρ(x), E(x) and φ(x). 

We need to solve Poisson’s equation using a simple 
but powerful approximation

3. The Depletion Approximation 
•  Assume the QNR’s are perfectly charge neutral 
•  Assume the SCR is depleted of carriers 
–  depletion region 
•  Transition between SCR and QNR’s sharp at 
–  ­x po  and x no (must calculate where to place these) 

x < − x po ; 

− x po  <  x < 0; 
0 < x < xno ; 

x >  xno ;

Still do not know xno  and x po ⇒⇒⇒⇒ need two more equations 

1. Require overall charge neutrality: 

qN a x po  = qN d x no 

2. Require φ(x) to be continuous at x=0;

4. Contact Potential 

Potential distribution in thermal equilibrium so far:
 

Question 1: If I apply a voltmeter across the pn junction 
diode, do I measure φB? 

yes 

no 
 

it depends 

Question 2: If I short terminals of pn junction diode, does 
current flow on the outside circuit? 

yes 

no 
 

sometimes

We are missing contact potential at the metal­
semiconductor contacts: 

Metal­semiconductor contacts: junction of dissimilar 
materials 
⇒ built­in potentials at contacts φ mn  and φ mp . 

Potential  difference across structure must be zero 
⇒ Cannot measure φB. 
φφφφB  = 
+φφφφmn  φφφφmp

What did we learn today? 
 

Summary of Key Concepts 

•	  Electrostatics of pn junction in equilibrium 
–	  A space­charge region surrounded by two 
quasi­neutral regions formed. 
•	  To first order, carrier concentrations in space­charge
 
region are much smaller than the doping level

–  ⇒⇒⇒⇒ can use Depletion Approximation

•	  From contact to contact, there is no potential build­

up across the pn junction diode

– 	  Contact potential(s).
