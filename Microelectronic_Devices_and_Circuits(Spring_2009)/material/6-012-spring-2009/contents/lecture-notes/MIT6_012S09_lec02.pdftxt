• 
In 6.012, “electron’ means free electron 
•  Not concerned with bonding electrons or core 
•  Not concerned with bonding electrons or core 
electrons 
•  Define:

2. Generation and 
Recombination 
GENERATION=break-up of covalent bond to form 
electron and hole pairs 

•  Requires energy from thermal or optical sources 
Requires energy from thermal or optical sources 
(or external sources) 
•  Generation rate: 
G = G( th) + Gopt  + ....[cm −3  • s−1 ] 
In general, atomic density >> n, p ⇒ 
• 
G ≠ f (n , p) 
–  supply of breakable bonds virtually 
inexhaustible 

RECOMBINATION=formation of covalent bond by 
bringing together electron and hole 

•  Releases energy in thermal or optical form 
•  Recombination rate: 
R = [cm −3  • s−1 ] 
•  1 recombination event requires 1 electron + 1 
R ∝ n • p 
hole ⇒ 

Generation and recombination most likely at surfaces 
where periodic crystalline structure is broken

Nothing wrong! 

We just made the approximation when we assumed 
that no  = Nd

We should really solve the following system of 
equations (for Na=0): 

po − no + Nd = 0

n o po = n i

Error in most practical circumstances too small
