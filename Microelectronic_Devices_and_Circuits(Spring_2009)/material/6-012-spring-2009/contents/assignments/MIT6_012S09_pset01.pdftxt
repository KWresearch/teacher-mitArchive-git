Problem 3 
 
 
Consider a bar of silicon in thermal equilibrium. A plot of the potential vs. x is 
shown below. (It linearity falls from 0.42V at x = 0 to 0.24V at x = 6 μm) Assume that 
the reference for this potential φ = 0, when no = po = ni.

X  ( μm)

 
a)  Plot the electron and hole concentration vs. x from 0 ≤ x ≤ 6 μm. 
 
b)  Plot the electric field vs. x.  
 
For parts c-d assume μn = 1000 cm2/V-sec 
 
c)  Calculate the electron drift current density vs. x. 
 
d)  Calculate the electron diffusion current density vs. x.
