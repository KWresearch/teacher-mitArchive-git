Problem 1 

You are given a CS amplifier and NMOS device parameters shown below. 
The current source supply provides 100µA and has an infinite output 
resistance, (i.e. ISUP = 100 µA and roc → ∞).  The current source supply 
must have at least 0.5 V across it in order to maintain the high output 
resistance. 

W/L = 150/1.5 
V  = 0.5 V
Tn
μnCox = 50 μA/V2 
λn = 0.067 V-1 @ L = 1.5 μm 

a)  Calculate VBIAS  such that VOUT = 0 V. 


b)  Draw the two-port model and calculate the two-port parameters Rin, Rout, and Av. 


c)  Calculate the overall voltage gain vout/vs. 


d)  Calculate the output voltage swing. 


 

Problem 2 

You are given a CE amplifier and NPN device parameters shown below.  
The current source supply provides 250µA and has an output resistance 
equal to ro of the NPN (i.e. ISUP = 250µA and roc = ro).  The current source 
supply must have at least 0.5V across it in order to maintain the high 
output resistance.
