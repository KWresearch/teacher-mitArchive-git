Problem 4 
 
Voltage controlled oscillators are used in most RF circuits to select a particular frequency 
to receive. They are made with tank circuits where the inductor value is fixed and the 
capacitor value is controllable by changing the voltage. Pn junction diodes are often used 
for these circuits as the variable capacitor. Consider a pn junction with p-side doping Na 
=1014
 and n-side doping Nd = 1016
 cm-3
 cm-3. Use the approximation that the junction is 
one-sided. 
 
a) What is the thermal equilibrium depletion region width? 
 
b) What is the reverse bias needed to increase the depletion width to 3 μm? 
 
c) If the maximum electric field allowable in the junction is Emax = 7×104 V/cm, what is 
the maximum depletion width? What is the bias voltage corresponding to the maximum 
depletion width? 
 
d) Given an inductance of 5 nH, calculate the area of the diode to make the resonant 
1
frequency 
 = 1 GHz, when the voltage across the diode is 0 V.

e) Plot the range of frequencies that can be tuned with the range of tuning voltages from 0 
V to the maximum voltage calculated in (c).
