Problem 1 

You are given a P-N junction diode with the device data shown below.  We 
forward bias the diode at VD= 0.66V. 

Device Data 

a) Calculate the total depletion region width, xD, for this forward biased diode. 

b) Calculate the minority carrier concentration at -xp ad8xn. 

c) Calculate the majority carrier concentration at  -xpand xn. 

d) Calculate J~~~~~(diffusion current density) at x=x, 

e) Calculate .TPaff  at x = Xn. 

f) Find the ratio of J;'/J$'~. 

g) Calculate I, 

h) Calculate the depletion capacitance. 

i) Calculate the diffusion capacitance. 

j)  Calculate the conductance gd. 

Problem 2 

Below  is a sketch not  to scale of  the minority carrier distribution across  the quasi-neutral 
regions  of  a  forward  biased  p-n  diode. For  this  diode, Wp  –  xp =  4 μm, Wn  –  xn =  3 μm, 
Dn = 25 cm2/s and Dp = 10 cm2/s. The area of the junction is 10 μm2. 

a)  What is the ratio of the doping levels across the junction: Na/Nd? 
 

b)  Calculate the hole current injected into the n-side of the diode. 
 

c)  Calculate the electron current injected into the p-side of the diode. 
 

d)  Calculate the diffusion capacitance associated with the carrier storage on the n-side of  
 
the diode. 

e) 	  Calculate the diffusion capacitance associated with the carrier storage on the p-side of 
the diode. 

f)	  How  much  should  the  voltage  across  the  junction  increase  if  we  wish  to  double  the 
total current through the diode? 

g)	  Compute  the  diffusion  capacitance  of  the  diode  when  we  increase  the  voltage  in  the 
manner suggested in the previous question.
