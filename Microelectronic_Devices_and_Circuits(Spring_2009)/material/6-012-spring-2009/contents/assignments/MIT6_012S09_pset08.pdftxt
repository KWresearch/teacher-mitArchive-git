Problem 3: 

Device Parameters 
RL=10kΩ
RS=5kΩ 
IS=10-15A 
βF=βo=100 
VA=25V

In Problem 2, the high source resistance lowered ω3db.  One method of improving the 
frequency response is to precede the common emitter stage with a common-collector, CC, 
also called an emitter-follower stage. Under this condition the source resistance of the CE 
amplifier is the output resistance of the CC amplifier. 

a.)  Find ISUP for the emitter follower such that its Rout equals 100Ω. 
b.)  Calculate VBIAS such that VOUT=0V. 
c.)  Calculate Cπ and Cμ from the device data for the emitter-follower. 
d.)  Use the open-circuit time constant method to calculate ω3db for the emitter-
follower. 

Problem 4: 

Device Parameters 
RS=100kΩ 
RL=1kΩ
roc =∞
VTn=1V 
λn=0.05V-1

μnCox=50uA/V2 
 Cox=2.3fF/um2 
 CJn=0.1fF/um2 
CJSWn=0.5fF/um 
 Ldiffn=6um 
Cov=0.5fF/um 

The frequency response of the NMOS common-gate amplifier depends on gm, Cgs, Cgd, 
and CL.  One method of increasing gm is to increase the bias current.  Another method of 
increasing gm is to increase the W of the device.  However, as the width of the device is 
increased, the parasitic capacitances also increase.  For this problem, let CL=Cdb.  Assume 
that the amplifier is biased such that VOUT=0V. 

a.)  Use the open-circuit time constant method to derive an expression for ω3db for the 
common-gate amplifier including CL. 
b.)  Use Matlab or Excel to plot ω3db vs. ISUP for 50uA < ISUP < 500uA.  Use 
W/L=50um/2um. 
c.)  Use Matlab or Excel to plot ω3db vs. W for 50um < W < 500um.  Use ISUP=100uA. 
d.)  What is the effect of increasing ISUP (for a constant W) on the frequency response 
of this amplifier?  What are some potential drawbacks of this approach? 
e.)  What is the effect of increasing W (for a constant ISUP) on the frequency response 
of this amplifier?  What are some potential drawbacks of this approach?
