General guidelines (please read carefully before starting): 

•	 Make sure to write your name on the space provided above. 

•	 Open book:  you can use any material you wish.  But no computers. 

•	 All answers should be given in the space provided. Please do not turn in any 
extra material. 

•	 You have 120 minutes to complete the quiz. 

•	 Make reasonable approximations and state them, i.e. low-level injection, extrinsic 
semiconductor, quasi-neutrality, etc. 

•	 Partial credit will be given for setting up problems without calculations. NO credit 
will be given for answers without reasons. 

•	 Use the symbols utilized in class for the various physical parameters, i.e. Na, τ, ε, 
etc. 

•	 Pay attention to problems in which numerical answers are expected.  An 
algebraic answer will not accrue full points.  Every numerical answer must have 
the proper units next to it.  Points will be subtracted for answers without units or 
with wrong units.  In situations with a defined axis, the sign of the result is also 
part of the answer. 

Unless otherwise stated, use:

1. (30 points) 

Consider two pn-junction diodes that have identical uniform doping profiles, but differ in 
substrate – one is made of silicon, and one is made of a silicon-germanium alloy (SiGe). 
Assume the intrinsic carrier concentration for SiGe at room temperature is 
approximately 1013  cm -3  and εSiGe = 1.5 x 10-12  F/cm
