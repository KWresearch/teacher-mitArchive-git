General guidelines (please read carefully before starting): 

•	 Make sure to write your name on the space provided above. 

•	 Open book:  you can use any material you wish.  But no computers. 

•	 All answers should be given  in the space provided. Please do not turn  in any 
extra material. 

•	 You have 120 minutes  to complete the quiz. 

•	 Make reasonable approximations and state them,  i.e.  low­level  injection, extrinsic 
semiconductor, quasi­neutrality, etc. 

•	 Partial credit will be given for setting up problems without calculations. NO credit 
will be given for answers without reasons. 
•	 Use the symbols utilized  in class for the various physical parameters,  i.e. Na, τ, ε, 
etc. 

•	 Pay attention to problems in which numerical answers are expected.  An 
algebraic answer will not accrue full points.  Every numerical answer must have 
the proper units next  to  it.  Points will be subtracted for answers without units or 
with wrong units.  In situations with a defined axis, the sign of  the result  is also 
part of  the answer. 

Unless otherwise stated, use:

q = 1.6 X 10­19  C

kT/q = 25 mV at room  temperature

ni  = 1010 cm ­3 for silicon at room  temperature

εsi  = 10­12 F/cm  εox = 3.45X10­13 F/cm

1.  (30 points) 
The following  is a serpentine IC resistor made by ion­implantation of Phosphorus  into p­
type Si.  The repeating stripes have length of 10 µm, and width of 1 µm, and the 
connecting regions are 1x1µm.  The dimensions are shown below.  The Phosphorus 
dose  implanted per unit area equals Q=1013  cm ­2, and the thickness after post­
annealing  is  t=0.1µm. You may ignore the contact potential effect and assume uniform 
doping.  Please use Figure 2 below to derive mobility.

(a) Compute the doping concentration  in the resistor, assuming that  the Phosphorus 
concentration is constant down to a depth of 0.1 µm.  Indicate the majority and 
minority carriers and calculate their concentration  in thermal equilibrium at room 
temperature. 

(b) Compute the total resistance of  the structure.

(c)  If  the voltage  is 1V, calculate the electric  field inside one of  the 10 µm x1µm 
stripes. 

(d)  In reality, the electron velocity will saturate when the electric  field inside the 
semiconductor reaches a certain value.  The saturation velocity of  the majority 
carrier  is 107  cm/s.  Calculate: 
a.	 The voltage when this happens, 
b.	 The maximum drift current that can flow, assuming that the carriers are 
drifting at the saturation velocity.

Consider  the n+ p diode shown below  in thermal equilibrium. The n+  doping is high 
enough such that you can assume that φ + = 0.55V , and that no potential drop occurs on 
n 
the n+ side of  the  junction. Assume that the p ­ Si  region between  x = − L  and  x = 0  is 
a  < 1015 cm −3 ).
