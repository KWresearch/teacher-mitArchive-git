General guidelines (please read carefully before starting): 

•	 Make sure to write your name on the space provided above. 
•	 Open book:  you can use any material you wish.  But no computers. 
•	 All answers should be given in the space provided. Please do not turn in any extra

material.  

•	 You have 120 minutes to complete the quiz. 
•	 Make reasonable approximations and state them, i.e. low-level injection, extrinsic

semiconductor, quasi-neutrality, etc. 

•	 Partial credit will be given for setting up problems without calculations. NO credit will be 
given for answers without reasons. 
•	 Use the symbols utilized in class for the various physical parameters, i.e. Na, τ, ε, etc. 
•	 Pay attention to problems in which numerical answers are expected.  An algebraic 
answer will not accrue full points.  Every numerical answer must have the proper units 
next to it.  Points will be subtracted for answers without units or with wrong units.  In 
situations with a defined axis, the sign of the result is also part of the answer. 

Unless otherwise stated, use:


q = 1.6 X 10-19 C

kT/q = 25 mV at room temperature

ni = 1010 cm-3 for silicon at room temperature

εSi = 10-12 F/cm  εox = 3.45X10-13 F/cm

You are given a pn junction diode where you have microscopy and chemical staining techniques

to determine the area of the diode is 10-4cm2 and the n-type region is degenerately doped 
(>>1019cm-3). 
You have access to a capacitance-voltage measurement system and have measured three data 
points and have been asked to determine some of the diode parameters.

unknown parameters.

3. (35 Points) 
A silicon npn bipolar transistor with Ebers-Moll parameters Is(Si) = 10-15A, and βF(Si)=100 is 
biased as shown below. 

IB=100µA 

VCE=2V 

a)  What is the region of operation? Explain your answer.

b)  Calculate the collector current Ic. 

c)  Calculate the base-emitter voltage, VBE.

d)	 A second npn bipolar transistor is fabricated with the emitter and collector regions 
consisting of Si, while the base region consists of another semiconductor, called SiGe, 
which has an intrinsic carrier concentration ni(SiGe) = 1 x 1011 cm-3. Assume that the 
diffusivities Dn and Dp in SiGe are identical to those for Si, and that the width of the 
emitter, base, and collector regions are the same in both devices, i.e. WE(Si)=WE(SiGe), 
WB(Si)=WB(SiGe), and WC(Si)=WC(SiGe). For both devices, NdE=1019 cm-3, NaB=1017 
cm-3, and NdC=1016 cm-3. Assume that recombination only takes place at the contacts. For 
VBE=0.6V and VBC=-1.4V, sketch the minority carrier densities in the emitter, base, and 
collector, for both the Si and SiGe transistors, on the axes below (note that the space-
charge regions are omitted and only the quasi-neutral regions are shown). Label the 
sketches with the numerical values at the contacts and at the edges of the space-charge 
regions. (i.e. neglect the space-charge regions)

of the collector saturation currents, IS(SiGe)/IS(Si). 

f)  For the Si and SiGe bipolar transistors and bias conditions in (d), calculate the ratio of the 
forward active current gains, βF(SiGe)/βF(Si).

g)	 The Si and SiGe bipolar transistors in (d) are now biased in the forward active region 
with the same VBC, and VBE adjusted such that the collector currents of the two devices 
are equal, i.e. Ic(Si)=Ic(SiGe). Under these bias conditions, calculate the ratio of the input 
resistances of the two devices, rπ(SiGe)/rπ(Si).
