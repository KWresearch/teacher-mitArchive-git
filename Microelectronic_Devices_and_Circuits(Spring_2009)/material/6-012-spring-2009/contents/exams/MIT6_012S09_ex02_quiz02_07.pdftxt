General guidelines (please read carefully before starting): 

•	 Make sure to write your name on the space provided above. 
•	 Open book:  you can use any material you wish.  But no computers. 
•	 All answers should be given in the space provided. Please do not turn in any extra 
material. 
•	 You have 120 minutes to complete the quiz. 
•	 Make reasonable approximations and state them, i.e. low-level injection, extrinsic 
semiconductor, quasi-neutrality, etc. 
•	 Partial credit will be given for setting up problems without calculations. NO credit will 
be given for answers without reasons. 
•	 Use the symbols utilized in class for the various physical parameters, i.e. Na, τ, ε, 
etc. 
•	 Pay attention to problems in which numerical answers are expected.  An algebraic 
answer will not accrue full points.  Every numerical answer must have the proper 
units next to it.  Points will be subtracted for answers without units or with wrong 
units.  In situations with a defined axis, the sign of the result is also part of the 
answer. 

Unless otherwise stated, use:

q = 1.6 X 10-19  C

kT/q = 25 mV at room temperature

ni  = 1010 cm-3 for silicon at room temperature
