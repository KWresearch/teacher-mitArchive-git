***** Grading *****
All the items below will enter into the computation of the final grade.
**** Quizzes ****
Two two-hour evening quizzes, open book, calculator required.
**** Final Exam ****
Three hours, open book, calculator required.
**** Homework ****
A total of eight problem sets will be handed out. The homework must be turned
in by 4pm sharp on the due date. A 50% penalty will be applied to homework
turned in after 4pm. Homework turned in after solutions are distributed (about
3 days later) will be graded, but no credit will be given. All exceptions to
this policy have to be approved by the lecturer. All homework sets will weigh
equally towards the final grade.
**** Design Problem and Web Labs ****
The design problem will be handed out one day after L12 and will be due one day
after L17. There will also be two Web labs that will introduce you to real live
device characterization. If you turn in the design problem or any of the Web
labs after its due date, the same policy as late homework applies.
**** Attendance ****
We expect students to attend lectures and recitations, and we will keep track
of attendance. The attendance record will be counted for 10% of the final
grade.
The course grade will be determined as follows:
           Grading criteria.
ACTIVITIES                  PERCENTAGES
Quiz 1                      15%
Quiz 2                      15%
Final exam                  30%
Homework                    10%
Design problem and web labs 20%
Attendance                  10%
The final letter grade will also take into consideration non-numerical
assessments of your command of the subject matter as evaluated by the lecturer,
instructors, and TAs.
