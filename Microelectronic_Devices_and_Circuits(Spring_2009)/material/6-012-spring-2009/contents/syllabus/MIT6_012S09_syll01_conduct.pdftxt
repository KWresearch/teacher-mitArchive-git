Policy for Academic Conduct 

The homework and design problem in 6.012 are prepared with the aim of complementing 
lectures and recitation sessions, as well as reinforcing key material.  It should be no surprise to 
you that typically there is a strong correlation between the homework grade and the total course 
grade, therefore you are far better off doing your homework in a timely manner.  There, too, 
should be no doubt to you that working on the problem sets and design problem is extremely 
effective in assuring your command of the course material.  Keeping this in mind, you may have 
questions about what constitutes ethical and unethical behavior while completing homework in 
6.012. 

Our judgement is that the primary purpose of homework is to help students learn and gain 
practical experience in the subject matter.  Allowing and encouraging collaboration with fellow 
students best serves this purpose.  Modern engineering is, after all, almost exclusively a team 
effort.  On the other hand, fairness requires us to be able to assess your own contribution – doing 
so will provide to you valuable feedback and help alleviate misunderstandings. Therefore, the 
written material that you hand in must be your own work, and any discussions or collaborations 
with fellow students must be identified in writing on your solution (e.g. noting "the solution to 
problem #2 benefited from discussions with John Moll", or "the optimization strategy of design 
problem #3 was worked out together with Jim Early").  Each party must acknowledge the 
collaboration. We will view two nearly identical solutions from two different students that do no 
cross-reference each other's designs as statistically "unlikely," thus worthy of further 
examination. 

This policy is intended to help you make the most out of 6.012 by allowing you to freely work 
with your classmates.  If you have doubts as to what constitutes ethical or unethical behavior, 
please contact any member of the staff.  We will be happy to assist you in your judgement.  

Violations of this policy will be handled with the maximum severity allowed by the Institute’s 
regulations regarding academic honesty as outlined on the web at
