Problem 1 – Common Collector Stage 

1.	 You  are  given  a  voltage  buffer  that  is  based  on  the  common  collector  stage  shown  in  the  figure 
below. It uses a current supply as shown and the signal source is a voltage. 

IS  = 5x10−15  A

a)  Find the value of VBIAS  so that VOUT  =0 V when ISUP  = 500 μA 
b)  Calculate the two port parameter Rin, Rout  and Avo when analyzed as a voltage amplifier. 
c)  Calculate the overall voltage gain, Av= vout/vs when the output is loaded as shown.
