Problem 1 – Electrostatics of MOS structure 

You are given an MOS capacitor made on silicon, and you are told that its flatband voltage is +0.5V and 
its threshold voltage VT  is +1.5 V. You are also told that the thickness of the gate insulator is tox  = 100 
Angstrom with a relative dielectric constant of 3.9 

a)  What is the carrier type of the silicon, n‐type or p‐type?

b)  What is the condition of the oxide / silicon interface when VGB  = 0 V?

c)  For what range of the VGB  is the silicon surface in what is termed the depletion condition and

is neither accumulated nor inverted? 
d)  This capacitor is biased such that  VGB  −VT  = 1.5 V and the silicon / oxide surface is 
inverted. What is the sheet charge density in the inversion layer?
