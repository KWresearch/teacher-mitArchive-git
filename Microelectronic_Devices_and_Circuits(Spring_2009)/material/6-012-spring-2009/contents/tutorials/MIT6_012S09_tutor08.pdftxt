Problem 1 – pn junction diode 

1.	 A one‐sided, short‐base, p/n+ diode has the following properties:  Na = 1x1016cm ‐3, Nd = 1x1019cm ‐3, 
area = 400 μm2, Wp  = 1.0 μm, and Wn  = 1.0 μm.  For VD = ‐2.5V / VD  = 0V / and VD  = 0.45V, 

a)  What is the depletion layer width?

b)  What is the maximum electrostatic field in the depletion region?

c)  What is the minority carrier concentration at the edges of the depletion layer?

d)  What is the minority carrier concentration at the contacts?
