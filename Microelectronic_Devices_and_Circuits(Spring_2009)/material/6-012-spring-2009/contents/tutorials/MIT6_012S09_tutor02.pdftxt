Problem 1 – Drift Conduction 

Current  generation  integrated  circuits  process  technologies  for Microprocessors  and  Dynamic  Random 
Access Memories  (DRAM) have physical gate  lengths of 23 nm (0.023 μm). For  this part of the problem 
assume that the active device cross‐sectional area is (0.023 μm)2  and the acceptor doping concentration 
of Na=4 ×1018  cm ‐3. 
a)  Estimate the velocity of the holes  in the channel  if the voltage drop across the channel  is 0.2 V. 
Assume the potential drop is linearly distributed and the operating temperature is 300K. 

b)  How long does it take the holes to travel across the channel? 

c)  What is the hole current?


Problem 2 ― Silicon Resistor and Sheet Resistance (based on P2.7) 

Figure P2.7  is a top view of a Si region which has metal electrical contacts on  two sides, across which a 
voltage of 2V is applied.  The Si layer is doped with 1013cm ‐3  As and is 2um thick.  At 300K, 
a)  What is the sheet resistance RÑ? 
b)  What is the resistance R? 
c)  Find the value of the electric field Ex  in the Si.
