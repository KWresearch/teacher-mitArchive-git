Problem 1 – pn junction electrostatics 

Consider a pn junction with Nd  = 5x1017  cm ‐3  and N = 1017  cm ‐3 
a 

as sketched below in Figure T3.1.

a)  What is the junction potential drop across the pn junction φJ =  φB  in thermal equilibrium? 
b)  What is the depletion layer width Xdo  in thermal equilibrium? 
c)  What is the electrostatic field at x=0, E(0), in thermal equilibrium? 
d)  What is the electrostatic potential at x= 0, φ( )0 , in thermal equilibrium? 
e)  What  is  the  total  amount  of  charge per  unit  area  on  the  p‐type  side  of  the  junction  in  thermal 
equilibrium 
f)  What is depletion capacitance, Cj, in thermal equilibrium? 
g)  How do parts a)‐f) change with a reverse bias of VD  = ‐3V?
