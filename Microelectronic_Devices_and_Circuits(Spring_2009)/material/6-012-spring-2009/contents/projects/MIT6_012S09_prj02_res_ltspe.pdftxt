LTSpice Quickstart Guide

The 6.012 staff strongly encourages you to use LTSpice for all simulations you will complete in 
this class. 
 
Linear Technology Corporation provides a widely used, free graphical SPICE simulator known 
as LTSpice. Download and install LTSpice IV from Stellar or the Linear Technology website, 
http://www.linear.com. LTSpice is only currently available for Windows. If you do not own a 
Windows machine, you may want to consider downloading the 30 day free trial of Crossover, a 
Windows compatibility layer for Mac (Intel processor) or Linux, at 
http://www.codeweavers.com/products/ . Alternatively, there are Windows clusters in: 
 

37-312 (faster, newer machines) 
Student Center  

 
If you install LTSpice in a Windows cluster, make sure to install it in your winathena directory, 
not the computer’s local directory.  
 
Quick Tips: 
 
(cid:131) 
In schematic editing, you can place any device from the current library, or any that you 
define yourself right into the schematic. LTSpice will automatically generate a netlist 
based on how you wire your components. 

 

 

 

 

 

(cid:131)  To exit any placement mode hit ESC. 

(cid:131)  Once you wire your devices and provide the necessary sources, visit View (cid:198) SPICE 
netlist to see the netlist LTSPICE has generated. This will be useful should you need to 
debug your circuit. 

(cid:131)  You can create a symbol of your schematic to instantiate in other schematics. When you 
have a schematic open, visit Hierarchy (cid:198) Open this Sheet’s Symbol. This allows you to 
create hierarchical schematics that are much easier to read and manipulate. For example, 
you can create an inverter schematic and generate a symbol for it. In the top level 
schematic you can instantiate that inverter several times such that when you manipulate 
the inverter schematic, it will change the schematic for all inverters you instantiate at the 
top level. 

(cid:131)  LTSpice (and most commonly used simulators) is generally much faster and friendlier to 
use if you get to know keyboard shortcuts well. Visit Tools (cid:198) Control Panel (cid:198) Drafting 
Options (cid:198) Hot Keys to either get to know default keyboard shortcuts or set up a set of 
shortcuts that are intuitive to you. 

 

(cid:131)  Any SPICE directive you place on the schematic will be incorporated into the netlist. 

(cid:131)  LTSpice documentation is available in its help menu F1.  
 
Device Models: 
 
For your convenience, the staff has created subcircuits to model the four terminal MOSFET. You 
must provide the model with the gate length (lg) and gate width (wg).  Backgates should be 
explicitly tied to GND for NFETs, and VDD for PFETs. 
 
When instantiating a MOSFET, identify the MOSFET as a subcircuit in the component attribute 
editor by using the ‘X’ prefix, and type the subcircuit name into the first Value line. Parameter 
values for lg and wg must be entered in the Value2 line.  
 
Save the following as a .sub file, or download the model file directly from Stellar, and call it in 
your schematic with the SPICE directive: 
.inc [filename].sub 
 
.subckt NFET D G S GND 
.model NCH NMOS LEVEL=1 VTO=0.5 TOX=1.5E-8 U0=220 
+ LAMBDA='(1.5u/lg)*1.0E-1' CJ=1.0E-4 
+ CJSW=5.0E-10 PB=0.95 GAMMA=0.6 
M1 D G S GND NCH l='lg' w='wg' ps='12u+wg' 
+ pd='12u+wg' as='6u*wg' ad='6u*wg' 
.ends NFET 
 
.subckt PFET D G S VDD 
.model PCH PMOS LEVEL=1 VTO=-0.5 TOX=1.5E-8 U0=110  
+ LAMBDA='(1.5u/lg)*1.0E-1' CJ=3.0E-4  
+ CJSW=3.5E-10 PB=0.9 GAMMA=0.6 
M1 D G S VDD PCH l='lg' w='wg' ps='12u+wg' 
+ pd='12u+wg' as='6u*wg' ad='6u*wg' 
.ends PFET
