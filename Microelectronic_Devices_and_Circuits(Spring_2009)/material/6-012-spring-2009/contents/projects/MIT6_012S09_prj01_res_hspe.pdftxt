HSPICE (Athena) Quickstart Guide 
 
 
If you really cannot access a PC to run LTSpice, you can complete your simulations using 
HSPICE, a non-graphical SPICE compiler available on Athena, and plot your output files using 
Avanwaves.  
 
Write your SPICE file using any text editor and save it with a .sp extension. 
 
There are main sections in a SPICE file are the following: 
A.  The netlist: Netlist is a designation for a computer readable representation of the circuit 
schematic. 
B.  The models: A model in SPICE is a description of the parameters of the equations used 
by spice to analyze the circuit. 
C.  The analysis to be performed: For example, a DC sweep from 0 to 1.0 V with 0.01 V 
increments, or a transient analysis for 100 ps with step 0.01 ps. 
D.  The end of the file: This isn’t really a main section, but HSPICE won’t work without it, 
and many people forget about it. Always put a .end statement at the end of your file. 
 
Also, note that HSPICE always treats the first line of your netlist as a comment. 
 
Use the same device models as given for LTSpice but with the .sp extension. A minimum size 
instantiation of the MOSFET models is shown below: 
 
X1 OUT IN VDD VDD PFET lg=1.5u wg=6u 
X2 OUT IN GND GND NFET lg=1.5u wg=6u 
 
A sample HSPICE inverter SPICE file may look like the following: 
 
* Netlist 
vdd 1 0 3 
vin in 0 3 
X1 OUT in 1 1 PFET lg=1.5u wg=6u 
X2 OUT in 0 0 NFET lg=1.5u wg=6u 
* Models 
.include 'filename.sp' 
* Analysis (DC Sweep) 
* post option necessary for awaves 
.options nomod post 
.dc vin 0 pvdd 0.01 
.end 
 

To run HSPICE on a SPICE file ‘[filename].sp’ and plot the results in Awaves, use the following 
commands: 
 
% add hspice 
% hspice filename.sp > filename.out & 
% awaves filename & 
 
Documentation for HSPICE and Awaves can be found at:

/mit/hspice/Z-2007.03-SP1/hspice/docs/avanwaves.pdf 
 
Note: Awaves does not run on Linux. To run plot your waveforms while on a Linux box: 
% ssh –Y x.dialup.mit.edu 
% add hspice 
% awaves name &
