Device Characterization Project #1 

PN DIODE CHARACTERIZATION 

Please write your recitation time on your project report. 

Introduction 

The goal of the device characterization projects in 6.012 is to expose students to real 
microelectronics devices: current-voltage characteristics, parameter extraction  techniques, 
and models. These projects use the MIT Microelectronics WebLab, an online 
microelectronics device characterization test station that Prof. del Alamo and his students 
have been developing for a while in his lab at MIT. The MIT Microelectronics WebLab 
is an experimental set up designed to allow the educational use of professional 
microelectronics characterization equipment by a large number of users through the 
internet. 

Access to WebLab is provided through the MIT iLab Service Broker available at  
http://ilab.mit.edu. Your first step is to register by clicking on the "New user registration" 
button. Then select admission in the "6.012 students" group. Registration is not automatic 
but actually must be approved by the system manager. You should therefore register early. 
Your one-stop shopping location for help, of any kind, regarding this assignment is 
through the "Report a Bug" tab in the iLab website. A manual for the use of this system can be 
downloaded from this site after logging in. 

Engineers working at the cutting edge often use state-of-the-art design and simulation 
tools in their work. This is worthwhile even if it means dealing with a few bugs, small 
annoyances, and less than optimal documentation. WebLab 6.0 and the MIT iLab Service 
Broker are the latest generation in online microelectronic device characterization. In spite 
of extensive testing, it is possible that a few bugs remain. As engineers working at the 
state-of-the-art, you should approach this project in a conservative way and carry out 
your assignment as early as possible. You should also seek help if you find any 
difficulties.  

In the device characterization projects of 6.012, you will carry out a fairly detailed DC 
characterization of several microelectronic devices using an HP4155B Semiconductor 
Parameter Analyzer. This professional tool is basically a fancy curve tracer that allows 

you to obtain current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of semiconductor devices. The first 
device to be characterized is a p-n junction diode.  

In this assignment, you will carry out the device characterization before the relevant 
theoretical material is presented in lecture. This is due to scheduling constraints, although 
we hope it will give you a strong motivation to learn the theoretical material when it is 
discussed. 

Assignment: pn diode characterization  

This problem is about characterizing a pn diode that is currently connected to the MIT 
Microelectronics WebLab. The “6.012 pn Diode (pn diode)” device is available in 
WebLab under the Devices menu. The details of the device connection are available 
on-line. Refer to Appendix A for basic information about the pn diode.  

You have to do the following: 

1) (25 points) Obtain I-V characteristics of the pn diode. Take measurements between -2 
and 1 V.  In the measurement results panel of WebLab, graph your results in the 
following way: 

Graph 1 Linear plot of I-V characteristics (V in x-axis in linear scale, I in y-axis in linear 
scale). Take a screen shot of  this graph. 

Graph 2 Semilogarithmic plot of I-V characteristics (V in x-axis in linear scale, I in y-
axis in logarithmic scale). Note: in a logarithmic scale, WebLab graphs the absolute of 
negative currents. Take a screen shot of this graph.  

You might need to go back and forth a few times trying different measurement point 
distributions so that sufficient data is taken in all regions of interest. Think also about 
issues involved in sweeping voltage vs. sweeping current. The maximum current the 
HP4155B can support is 100mA (Imax=100mA). The minimum current you can measure 
accurately is º1pA (Iminª1pA) since the noise floor for the instrument is about 1pA. 

2) (20 points) When you are happy with the results, download the data to your local 
machine and port them into your favorite spreadsheet program or MATLAB for graphing 
and analysis. Then do the following: 

Graph 3 Linear plot of I-V characteristics (V in x-axis in linear scale, I in y-axis in linear 
scale). Print out this graph. 

Graph 4 Semilogarithmic plot of I-V characteristics (V in x-axis in linear scale, I in y-
axis in logarithmic scale). Note: in your spreadsheet program, you will have to compute 

the absolute of the current before you can graph it in a logarithmic scale. Print out this 
graph. 

3) (20 points) Study the ideal model for the I-V characteristics of the pn diode in 
Appendix A. Devise a simple scheme to extract from the measured data the saturation 
current, Is (in A) and the temperature of the diode, T (in K). You can find the values of 
the fundamental constants that you need in Howe & Sodini. Illustrate your procedure 
graphically and give the extracted values.  Remember if Is < 1pA you cannot directly 
measure it when V is negative.  You are just measuring the noise floor of the instrument. 

4) (10 points) A more realistic model for a pn diode includes a parasitic series resistance, 
as discussed in Appendix A. Using the values of Is and T derived in the previous section, 
devise a simple scheme to extract from the measured data the series resistance, Rs (in Ω, 
of the diode. Illustrate your procedure graphically and give the extracted value.  

5) (25 points) Compare the experimental characteristics with those predicted by the 
theoretical models for the pn diode given in Appendix A. To do this, graph together the 
experimental measurements, the predictions of the ideal model, and the predictions of the 
model that includes series resistance. Plotting the I-V characteristics of the model that 
includes series resistance is a bit tricky because I is on both sides of the equation. A good 
way to do it is to solve for V, then compute V vs. I, and finally plot I vs. V.  

Turn in the following graphs: 

Graph 5) Linear plot of I-V characteristics (V in x-axis in linear scale, I in y-axis in 
linear scale). Show experimental data points with symbols, ideal model with dashed line 
and second-order model with continuous line. Print out this graph.  

Graph 6) Semilogarithmic plot of I-V characteristics (V in x-axis in linear scale, I in y-
axis in logarithmic scale). Show experimental data points with symbols, ideal model with 
dashed line and second-order model with continuous line. Print out this graph.  

Additional information and assorted advice 

•The required graphs need not be too fancy, just simply correct. They must have proper 
tickmarks, axis labelling, and correct units. When there are several lines, each one should 
be properly identified (handwriting is OK).  

•You have to exercise care with this device. Please do not apply a higher voltage than 
suggested. The pn diode is real and it can be damaged. If the characteristics look funny, 
try one of the other devices and let us know. 

•It will be to your advantage to make good use of the Set-up management functions that 
are built into the tool under the File menu. 

•For research purposes, the system keeps a record of all logins and all scripts that each 
user executes. 

Note on collaboration policy 

In carrying out this exercise (as in all exercises in this class), you may collaborate with 
somebody else that is taking the subject. In fact, collaboration is encouraged. However, 
this is not a group project to be divided among several participants. Every individual 
must have carried out the entire exercise, that means, using the web tool, graphing the 
data off line, and extracting suitable parameters. Everyone of these items contains a 
substantial educational experience that every individual must be exposed to. If you have 
questions regarding this policy, please ask the instructor. Prominently shown in your 
solutions should be the name of the person(s) you have collaborated with in this 
homework.  

Appendix A: DC I-V characteristics of pn diode 

Ideal model 

The ideal I-V characteristics of a pn diode are given by: 

I =

where Is is the saturation current. 

Second-order model 

"Real" diodes suffer from a number of parasitics. One of the most important ones is the 
presence of parasitic series resistance, Rs. This reduces the voltage that is available to 
the junction from an external one V to an internal one V-IRs. Hence, the DC I-V 
characteristics of the diode are given by: 

I
