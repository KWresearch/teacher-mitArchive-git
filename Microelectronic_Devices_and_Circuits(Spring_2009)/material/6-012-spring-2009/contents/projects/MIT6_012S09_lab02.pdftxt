Device Characterization Project #2 
 
DEVICE CHARACTERIZATION AND CIRCUIT DESIGN 

 
 
 
Please write your recitation time on your project report. 
 
Introduction 
 
In this project, you will characterize the current-voltage characteristics of an npn bipolar 
junction transistor (BJT) and an n-MOSFET. To do this, you will use the MIT 
Microelectronics WebLab. The npn BJT is available in location 3 of WebLab. It is 
labeled “npn BJT” (2N3904). The n-MOSFETs are in location 2, labeled “nMOSFET” 
(2N7000). This exercise involves three phases: (i) characterization of the devices, large 
and small signal parameter extraction, (ii) using the measurements to choose bias 
voltages for a common collector amplifier to meet amplifier specifications, and (iii) using 
the measurements to determine small signal two port model parameters at the bias point. 
 
Take the measurements specified in the following pages. When you are happy with the 
results (as judged by the characteristics displayed through the web), download the data to 
your local machine for more graphing and further analysis. You will find it useful to 
study the contents of Appendix A, which describes what the measured data should 
roughly look like and gives a short overview of the relevant equations. 
 
The WebLab server is available at http://ilab.mit.edu/
 
Important: Only hand in items for which you are asked. Do not hand in extra items, such 
as dumps of your measured data.  
 
Late Policy: Late projects will only receive 50% of the normal grade. You are advised to 
measure the devices early. If you start only one or two days before the project is due, and 
for whatever reasons you cannot get your measurements done, you will not be granted an 
extension. While we try to fix problems (blown devices, etc.) as soon as possible, the 
response time may not be instant. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Design of Common Collector Amplifier with NMOS Current Source 
 
In this assignment you will characterize both an npn-BJT and an NMOS transistor, 
(separately), and use the measurements to design a common collector (emitter follower) 
amplifier with an NMOS current source, shown in Figure 1. In the design, you will 
choose the bias voltage VB of the NMOS current source and the DC bias voltage, VBIAS, 
in order to meet the following specs. 
 
 
DC voltage gain Av0 > 0.98 
Input resistance Rin > 5 MΩ 
Output resistance Rout < 100 Ω 
Voltage swing ±1 V about DC level 
Supply voltage VDD = 3 V 
DC Output voltage VOUT = 1.5 V 
Allowable current bias range: 50 µA < IC < 1 mA  
(Consider this current range in graphs you present.)

Device Characterization (50 points) 
 
1) (20 points) Obtain I-V characteristics for the BJT and the NMOS transistor, seperately. 
For the NMOS, use a maximum VDS and VGS of 3 Volts. Measure ID vs. VDS with VGS as 
a parameter. For the BJT, measure IC vs. VCE as a function of various IB. You can find the 
range of IB for the BJT characterization by measuring the NMOS first. The range of IB 
should be such that the resulting IC is of the same order of magnitude as your measured 
ID (since the amplifier operating point must have ID = IC). Also, to find gm and rπ, measure 
IC and IB as a function of VBE. Because of the exponential dependence, you must be 
careful with the value of VBE you apply. Values above 0.9 V can damage the device! 
Look at your output characteristics for the BJT. If you also recorded VBE in the 

measurements, you can get an idea of what values of VBE to use. Do this measurement for 
various values of VCE.  Download the data onto your computer for use in Matlab, Excel 
or the plotting tool of your choice. Show your measurement results in the following way: 
 
graph 1: output characteristics of the BJT, IC vs. VCE, for different values of IB. 
graph 2: output characteristics of the NMOS, ID vs. VDS, for different values of VGS. 
graph 3: for the BJT, plot IC vs. VBE, with values of VCE =1.5V. 
graph 4: for the BJT, plot IB vs. VBE, with values of VCE =1.5V. 
Note: Screen-shots of the WebLab measurements are not acceptable as graphs. Graphs 
must be appropriately labeled (by hand is okay) for full credit. 
Hand in: 4 graphs as specified 
 
 
2) (30 points) So that you can select a bias point, you will need to graph some of the 
small signal parameters as a function of the bias point. 
graph 5: plot the output resistance (ro) of the NMOS as a function of VDS, for different 
values of ID. 
graph 6: plot the output resistance (ro) of the BJT as a function of VCE, for different 
values of IC. 
graph 7: for VDS = 1.5 V, plot the output resistance (ro) of the NMOS as a function of ID. 
graph 8: for VCE = 1.5 V, plot the output resistance (ro) of the BJT as a function of IC. 
graph 9: plot the transconductance (gm) as a function of IC, for VCE = 1.5 V. 
graph 10: plot rπ of the BJT as a function of IC for VCE = 1.5 V. 
Hand in: 6 graphs as specified, appropriately labeled 
 
 
Amplifier Design (50 points) 
 
1) (20 points) (Small Signal - 20 points) To help you determine the bias voltages, for the 
amplifier circuit of Figure 1, write down the equations for the DC voltage gain (Avo) and 
the input and output resistances (Rin, Rout) in terms of the parameters derived from the 
measurements (gm, roBJT , roMOS, rπ). Do not make simplifying assumptions (i.e. include 
effect of ro) 
Take the requirements that the specs pose on Avo, (Rin, Rout and the equations from above 
to solve for conditions that the specs pose on gm, ro, and rπ. For what range of ISUP = IC = 
ID do you meet the specs? 
Hand in: expressions as specified (show your work that leads to them or state where you 
found them), range of ISUP that meets the specs. 
 
 
2) (30 points) (Bias point selection - 30 points) Now that you have expressed the specs in 
terms of the measured small signal parameters and the requirements imposed on them, 
choose bias voltages VB and VBIAS that correspond to a point that meets the specs. Use 
the conditions you found in part 1. You will now also need to consider the voltage swing, 
Vpp. You can determine the swing by looking at roMOS vs. VDS and roBJT vs. VCE curves. 
The swing is met wherever the gain, input resistance, and output resistance specs are met. 

What device limits the up and down swing, and what physical effect causes the 
limitation? 
For your choice of bias voltages, find the measured small signal parameters and from 
there compute Avo, Rin, Rout and Vpp. 
Hand in: the values for VB and V
BIAS, the resulting Avo, Rin, Rout and Vpp. State your 
reasoning that led to the choice of bias voltages, and an explanation of the upper and 
lower limitations of Vpp. 
Hint: If you cannot find bias conditions that meet the specs, re-measure the devices 
around the bias point that meets the specs most closely. That way you have better 
resolution, since in your first measurements you may have measured so coarsely that the 
steps between the data are so large that you miss the working bias points. 
 
 
Additional Information and Advice 
 
The required graphs need not be too fancy, just simply correct. They must have proper 
tick marks, axis labeling, and correct units. When there are several lines, each one should 
be clearly identified (handwriting is OK). 
If you encounter problems with WebLab or the devices, please use the”Report a Bug” 
link on the WebLab website.  
 
Exercise care with these devices. Do not apply a higher voltage than suggested. The 
transistors are real and they can be damaged. If the characteristics look funny, try a 
different device and let us know. It will be to your advantage to make good use of the set-
up management functions that are built into the tool under the file menu of the channel 
definition panel (see manual). For research purposes, the system keeps a record of all 
logins and all scripts that each user executes. 
 
 
 

Note on collaboration policy 

 
In carrying out this exercise (as in all exercises in this class), you may collaborate with 
somebody else that is taking the subject. In fact, collaboration is encouraged. However, 
this is not a group project to be divided among several participants. Every individual 
must have carried out the entire exercise, which means, using the web tool, graphing the 
data off line, and extracting suitable parameters. Every one of these items contains a 
substantial educational experience that every individual must be exposed to. If you have 
questions regarding this policy, please ask the instructor. Prominently shown in your 
solutions should be the name of the person(s) you have collaborated with in this 
homework.
