Recitation 1: IC Technology

How are integrated circuits being designed and fabricated?
→
→
1. IC Design: application
circuits
route, circuit simulation, etc

design: design tools include layout, place and

2. Fabrication and Integration:

(a) What material that allows the development of microelectronics?  a class of ma-
terials called “semiconductors”
•  two types of “carriers” - electron and hole (the missing of an electron)
•  carrier concentrations can be controlled over many orders of magnitude by
doping and electric ﬁeld eﬀects.
Examples of semiconductors: GaAs, GaN, Si, Ge. This class will focus on Si.
(b) How to make Si wafers (from sand, crystal growth . . . ?)
(c) Fabrication
•  Deﬁning area: “Lithography” (mostly in industry - photolithography)
•  Cutting out material = “etching” (wet vs. dry)
•  Insulation= SiO 2 (oxide) or Si 3N 4 (nitride), oxidation or nitride deposi-
tion
•  Tuning conductivity (carrier concentration) = doping (ion implantation)
•  Metallic wiring (interconnect): Al now Cu
•  Chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP)
(d) The heart of microelectronics
