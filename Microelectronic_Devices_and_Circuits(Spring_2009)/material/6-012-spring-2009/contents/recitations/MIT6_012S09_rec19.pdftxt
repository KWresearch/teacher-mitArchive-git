Transistor Ampliﬁers

Yesterday we started our discussion on transistor ampliﬁers. For ampliﬁers, we have:

Voltage and transconductance ampliﬁers are most common. Yesterday, we discussed the
common-source ampliﬁer shown below:

Today, we will discuss common-emitter ampliﬁer (for the BJT version) 

Resistor Bias
At Collector

Current Source
At Collector

For ampliﬁer circuits, what we are interested in are:
• What is the operating point? (Bias point)
• Signal Swing?
• Small signal gain; input resistance; output resistance
• Frequency Response

Among these, ﬁrst two are large signal analysis, while the last two are related to smal l
signal circuits.

DC Bias Point
For large signal analysis, Vs & Rs will be gone. Also make RL ∞. See ﬁgure 4,
Vout = Vcc − Ic · Rc
If we choose Vout = Vcc = 2.5 V (Vcc = 5 V), Rc = 10 kΩ

Signal Swing
• Upswing limited by BJT going into cutoﬀ: Total signal Vout,max = Vcc
• Down swing limited by BJT going out of FAR into saturation Vout,min = VCE,SAT

Small Signal Analysis of CE Ampliﬁer

First obtain the small signal circuit of the circuit in Figure 4
• Short DC voltage bias
• Open DC circuit bias

Intrinsic will be (without Rs and RL )

This is a transconductance ampliﬁer, it turns out its small signal circuit is very similar to
the topography of our “two port model”

If Rc (cid:2) RL or Rc < RL , transconductance gain is degraded.

So we need a large Rout (output is a current)
⇒
⇒
= use a current source at the collector = Figure 5 can be a p-MOSFET, Rc
(in small signal circuit, DC current is open)

On the CE Amp.

We consider the CE Amp. to be a transconductance ampliﬁer. In fact, it can also be just
a voltage ampliﬁer. In that case, the two port model becomes:
