As seen, tp ∝ L. This means, the longer the devices, the slower they become. This gets us
to why NAND gates are preferred.

NAND vs. NOR

Gets us to why NAND gates are preferred:

This is exactly 
like the following: 

n+ region is highly 
doped
no resistance

Eﬀective length of two n-channel devices in series

Leﬀ = 2Ln

For symmetrical transfer characteristics,

tPLH = tPHL
μn = 2μp
Leﬀ n = 2Lp
∴ wn = wp

But since μn = 2μp , we are better oﬀ having the series connection in NAND (rather than

NOR where PMOS’s are in series). If we wanted the same thing in NOR:

∴ wp

NOR Structure

So for NAND:

(cid:2) (cid:3)
w

For M-input NAND:

(cid:2) (cid:3)

Reason is?

M-input NAND has M-NMOS’s in series =⇒ Leﬀ = M Ln . So, for kneﬀ = kpeﬀ :

Assume the next stage is another inverter. CL is all capacitances seen at node Vout .

Design Pro ject 

⇒
What is the use of the circuit? Light in = width modulated electrical signal out.

What does each stage do?
•  N1 : charging 1,2 capacitors with Ilight + Ibias

• At TM : tipping point, Vout changes from High to Low

⇒
= say VM,1 = 1 V
VM,2 = 2 V

•  Final stage: driver stage
You need enough current to be able to charge CL quickly enough to meet tr and tf
of specs. Decide how many stages you need (remember Vout positive pulse we need),
and think about ratio of sizing between stages (hint: between 3 − 6 is the answer)

Speciﬁcations
•  Vout : tr , tf 3 ns
•  Minimum gate areas
•  At least 20 ns distinction between pulse widths corresponding to diﬀerent Ilight levels
of 0, 1, 2, 3, μA
• Report: what should you submit
