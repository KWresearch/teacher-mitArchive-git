Small Signal Models

On Tuesday we talked about smal l signal models of MOSFETs. Why do we need small
signal modeling?

To linearize circuits. Linear circuits are much easier to work with: we can use Thevenin/Norton
equivalent circuits, superposition, etc.

How to obtain a linearized circuit?

If we limit our signals to a relatively small amplitude, (this is in fact most often the case),
the non-linear IV curves (as seen in 1 for example) can be considered piece-wise linear =⇒
small signal model.

What Happens at Low Frequency?

To obtain a small signal equivalent circuit, we need to ﬁnd an operation point ﬁrst: Q(VDS , VGS , VBS ). 
(Q is a speciﬁc point on Fig. 1) thus ID is also known.

Now what does the small signal circuit look like? 

Figure 3: Low Frequency Small Signal Circuit. Two of them are voltage controlled current sources, one is
a resistor. Why?

What Happens at High Frequency?

There are intrinsic or parasitic capacitances related to the MOSFET structure, as we know
Zc = jwC . At low frequency, Zc is very large, can be approximated to open circuit, however 
1
at high frequency, Zc is small enough we have to consider. 
We have 4 terminals. Considering the possible combinations between them, we have: 

Figure 4: Between D & S, we have conduction channel, no capacitance between D & S

What are these capacitances (under saturation)? 

Figure 5: Capacitances (under saturation)

1.  Cgs , two contributions, ﬁrst is the MOS capacitor capacitance under inversion was Cox
before, but since under saturation regime, we have large VDS , the inversion layer is non-
uniform in charge density, need to do integration of qG to consider this. We will skip
the math here since it is derived in lecture already. The result is wLCox −→ 2 Cox · wL.

The other contribution is from the overlap between the source and gate Cov

MOSFETS in Digital Circuits

Now we have both the low frequency and high frequency version of the small signal equiv- 
alent circuit. What has it to do with our MOSFET digital circuit discussion? 
For digital circuits, there are two important aspects: 
1. Noise Margin: larger noise margin −→ higher noise immunity, better
2. Speed: the concept of “propagation delay”. We want circuit response to be fast, =⇒
low propagation delay

Now the question is, when we design a circuit, what parameters aﬀect the noise margin and
what aﬀects the delay?

Noise Margin

Our inverter is shown below:

NMH = VOH − VIH 
NML = VIL − VOL 
⇒
In order to have a high noise margin, we want high slope at Vm = high gain Av at Vm .

Gain

How to ﬁnd gain at Vm? Use a small signal circuit:

The larger the R the bigger the noise margin. However, as we will see later, the larger R
the slower the circuit. There is a tradeoﬀ since capacitances in the circuit add delay.
