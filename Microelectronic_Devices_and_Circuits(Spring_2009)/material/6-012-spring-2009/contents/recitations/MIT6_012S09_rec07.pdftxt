Recitation 7: From n+p diode to MOS structure

Consider a p-n diode with very asymmetric doping:

q(Na + Nd )Nd

xpo =
q(Na + Nd )Na
xno (cid:2) xpo

The SCR is entirely on the lightly doped side.

Q is the charge per unit area (charge/cm2 ) and ρ(x) is the space charge density (charge/cm3 ).

Now if we insert an insulator layer (oxide) in between n+ and p, we obtain our MOS
structure.

Same doping level: Nd = 1020 cm−3 , Na = 1016 cm−3 
How does the depletion region xdo compare with xpo above? 
We can take some intuitive guess ﬁrst. Then let us look at the problem quantitatively.

QG = qNaxdo Coulomb/cm2

VB,O is potential drop across semiconductor body, while Vox,O is potential drop across oxide. 
(Note that unit wise: potential, voltage and bias are the same). 
But φB is ﬁxed (same as n+p junction).

This is very important to calculate n(0), p(0) carrier concentration at the surface!! 
Now we see that xdo should be less than xpo in the n+p junction case, because much less 
potential drop (VB,O compared to φB ) a lot of potential dropped across the oxide.

Yesterday, we also talked about what happens when we apply a bias (voltage)
VGB means body ground, gate in reference to body (Compare to VD in diode case). It does
not matter whether n or p for this deﬁnition. Since there is oxide, no matter VGB > 0 or

⇒
VGB < 0, there is no current. = still consider like “thermal equilibrium”

n(0) = ni e(qφ(0)/kT)

Tomorrow, we will see more detailed discussion on what will happen to the surface carrier
density n(0) or p(0) when we apply VGB . The surface carrier density will determine whether
the MOSFET channel can conduct or not.
