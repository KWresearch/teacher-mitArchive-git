Recitation 17: BJT-Basic Operation in FAR

BJT stands for Bipolar Junction Transistor
1. Can be thought of as two p-n junctions back to back, you can have pnp or npn.

In analogy to MOSFET small current IB or voltage VBE , controls large current Ic

2. How does it work?
• As we learned previously, for an asymmetric pn junction:

ID = IDn + IDp electron & hole diﬀusion currents
i ×
D
(cid:3)(cid:4)
(cid:2)
(cid:5)
n− xp )
a = qAn2
Na (w
p
contribution from (1) e− diﬀusion in p-region
D
(cid:3)(cid:4)
(cid:2)
(cid:5)
p− xn )
Nd (w
n
contribution (2) from hole diﬀusion in n-region

i ×
b = qAn2

×(eqVD /kT − 1)

×(eqVD /kT − 1)

ID = a + b
If Nd (cid:2) Na , the contribution from hole (2) is much lower than that from electron
(1)
• For BJT, the doping proﬁles are very asymmetric

NdE (cid:2) NaB (cid:2) NdC
For example, NdE = 1020 cm−3 , NaB = 1018 cm−3
NdC = 1016
this is critical for BJT to function well. Why?

Minority carriers concentration under T.E. 

• Minority carrier concentration under FAR: (broken linear y axis) 

(a) At contacts, equilibrium concentration (PnEO , PnCO )
(b) BE junction forward biased:  minority carrier concentration increased by
eqVBE /kT
(c) Base-collector (BC) junction reverse biased: minority carrier concentration
decreased by eqVBC /kT −→ 0
⇒
(d) No recombination in QNR = linear proﬁle
(e) These proﬁles result in diﬀusion currents (In BJT, the current we calculate
are diﬀusion currents; in contrast, for MOSFET, the currents we calculate
(ID ) are drift currents).

the current we calculate will be from p-n which will be right

1. For current in the base terminal, it is only the hole current. (in base, this will be
ma jority carrier current (drift-diﬀusion); in emitter, this becomes minority carrier
diﬀusion current, as we calculated). Look at Fig. 1, the base is so thin that all the
electron current is directly swept to the collector, can not reach hole contact
2. Current in the collector terminal, is only the electron current, and do not depend on
VBC . What happened to the hole diﬀusion current due to the doping ﬁle in collection
region in Fig. 5, IC = IS · eqVBE /kT .
It is too small to be counted. 
VBC is reverse biased, ID = Io (eqVBC /kT − 1) (cid:5) −Io 
3. What about IE?

IE = −(IB + IC )
4. Relationship between IB and IC . We see that both IB and IC ∝ eqVBE /kT

5. Why NaB (cid:2) NdC?
When we apply negative VBC , the depletion layer will increase. Eﬀectively, wB will

decrease.
( =

In addition, if depletion layers in the base region touch each other from both sides
(emitter → collector) =⇒ punch through
=⇒ undesirable =⇒ high enough doping
