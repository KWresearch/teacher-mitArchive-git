Recitation 24: BiCMOS Cascode Ampliﬁer

Yesterday, we talked about Multistage ampliﬁers. The simplest way to have multi-stage
ampliﬁers is to directly connect the output of the previous stage to the next stage, as we
talked about yesterday. We call this way “cascade”.

Today we will talk about another topology - “cascode” (Before doing that, we can have a
simple exercise) What is the following ampliﬁer and what is its function?

Figure 1: This is a CD-CC Voltage Buﬀer. Since Rin of CD is ∞, this can couple very well with the
voltage signal of the previous stage, even there is a high Rout at the previous stage

And CC Rout =
Rout .

We would like to put these two together. 
(You will see advantages later: MOS has large Rin and BJT has good frequency response)

But instead “cascading”, we do the following: 

Let us look at the small signal model (low frequency)

Rout = γo [1 + gm (γπ ||Rs )] ||γoc
Rs = γo1

It is the same as CS ampliﬁer itself ! Why would we want to add the CB stage?

3. Now combining the two together

Apply OCT technique (+ Miller Approximation) for frequency response:
(a) Cgs1 : RTHCgs1

(b) Cgd1 : voltage gain across Cgd1 is

Therefore, BICMOS cascode ampliﬁer has overall voltage gain of C-S, but with frequency
response comparable to CB Ampliﬁer.
