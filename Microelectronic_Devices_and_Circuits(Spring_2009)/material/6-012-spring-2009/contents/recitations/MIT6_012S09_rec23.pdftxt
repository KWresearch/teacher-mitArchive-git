Recitation 23: Frequency Response of Common 
Collector & Common-Base Ampliﬁer 

Yesterday, we used OCT technique for the frequency response of Common-Drain and
Common-Gate ampliﬁers. Today we will look at C-C, C-B frequency response.
Common-Collector Ampliﬁer

One way to study the frequency response is to
• First ﬁnd the small signal equivalent model for the circuit
• Do KCL, KVL nodal analysis, to ﬁnd CO3dB
• Or use OCT + Miller Approximation to ﬁnd w3dB

However, the small signal model of this circuit is quite complicated (as the C-D Amp. we
talked about yesterday). What we can do is directly use the two-port model for the circuit,
and add in the capacitances. So the methodology is as outlined below.

Methodology

1. Start with low frequency two port model, obtain Av , Ai, Gm at low frequency

2. Identify the nodes (S/D/G/B for MOS; B/E/C for BJT) and add in capacitance in
active device

3. Use Miller Approximation in conjunction with OCT to estimate bandwidth (w3dB ).
Advantage: can directly use the “Rin”,“Rout” from two-port model, only need Av , Ai orGm
much easier.

Identify the B/E/C and add in capacitances

Note: the other end of Cπ is to the right of Rout ! That is where “E” node is! Cπ is in the
input/output feedback position.

In contrast to C-S or C-E ampliﬁer, the Miller eﬀect reduces the capacitance in this case,
which will give better frequency response: (or another way to look at it, eﬀect of Cπ is very
small, since voltage gain across Cπ is ≈ 1. We do not need a lot of charges to go in/out the
capacitor. And typically the movement of charges is the source to slow down the frequency
response).
• 

⇒
Therefore like C-D, Miller eﬀect reduces capacitor value, = expect good
frequency response.
•  Use of C-C: for multistage ampliﬁers, can enable high Rin , low Rout , won’t
degrade frequency response
