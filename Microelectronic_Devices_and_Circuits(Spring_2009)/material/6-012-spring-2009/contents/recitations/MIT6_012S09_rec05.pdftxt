Recitation 5: Review on Electrostatics 

This review is aimed at getting ready for p-n junction. Before the class, have an exercise
on the Boltzman relationship:
1. If the doping of Si is 1016 Boron, what should be the corresponding electrostatic
potential be? (φ = −6 × 60 = −360 mV)

2. If φ = 480 mV, what is equilibrium electron concentration? (
3. If doping is Nd = 1020 cm−3 , φ =? (φ = 600 mV
The following is the set of equations which relates ρ(x), E (x), φ(x) needed for this class
(everything is 1D):

Like in Figure 1

Then, let us work out E (x), by splitting calculations into 4 regions:
1.  E (x ≤ −2 μm) = E(x ≥ 2 μm)
(∵ no charge outside these regions)

Now for the electrostatic potential: 
As we do the integration, the results will be relative. Then we can use the doping of Si to 
ﬁnd the actual value. For this thought-example, let us make φ(0) = 0. 
For 0 < x < 1 μm, E(x) = constant = 1.6 × 103 V/cm.

∵ E (x) = 0 electrostatic potential will be constant
Similarly, we can work out the other side:
