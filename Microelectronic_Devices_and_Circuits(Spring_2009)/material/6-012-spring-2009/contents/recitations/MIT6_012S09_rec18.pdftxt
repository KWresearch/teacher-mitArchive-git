Understanding the IC vs. VCE curve: IC drops rapidly below VCE,SAT (cid:2) 0.1 to 0.2 V.

Why?
•  Each curve IB is ﬁxed
•  VCE = VBE − VBC , =⇒ VBC = VBE − VCE
•  When VCE is large, VBC < 0, FAR. As we reduce VCE , VBC reduces, at some point, VBC
→
starts to become forward biased. Now, hole ﬂux from B
C increases exponentially
from Law of Junction; to keep IB constant, hole ﬂux into emitter must be reduced,
⇒
⇒
= VBE drops, = IC drops quickly.

Small Signal Model of BJT

(Next week we will be using BJT & MOSFET for ampliﬁer circuits) Want to know the

The input resistance of MOSFET is ∞. In order to have a high input resistance for
BJT, need high current gain βF

3. Output resistance: Ebers-Moll model have perfect current source in FAR. Real char-
acteristics show some increase in ic with VCE

go = δ ic
δVCE

where does go come from?

In FAR: Ic = Is eqVBE /kT =
wB shrinks as |VBC | ↑, thus Ic ↑.

VA increases with increasing base width and increasing base doping. This is also why NaB

Cb is in between base and emitter:

Cb + CjE = Cπ

Add the following
• depletion capacitance: collector to bulk CCS
• parasitic resistances: γb of base, γex of emitter, γc of collector
