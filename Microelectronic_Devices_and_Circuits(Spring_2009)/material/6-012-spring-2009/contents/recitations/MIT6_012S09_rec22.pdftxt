Recitation 22: CS Ampliﬁer Frequency Response

Yesterday, we discussed the frequency response of a CE Ampliﬁer, using the following
methods.
•
Full analysis (using model Analysis to derive Vout )
Vs
• Miller approximation
• Open circuit time constant technique

Today we will look at the frequency response of CS Ampliﬁer using 2-3.
