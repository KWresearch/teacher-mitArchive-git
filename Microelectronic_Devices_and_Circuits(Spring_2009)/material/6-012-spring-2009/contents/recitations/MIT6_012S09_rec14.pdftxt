Recitation 14: I-V characteristics of p-n junction
diode (I)

What happens to the (minority) carrier concentrations when a bias is applied?

Location-Dependence

In order to see what happens to the minority carrier concentrations at diﬀerent locations
inside a diode when a bias V is applied, let us look at some diagrams:

1. QNR & SCR (or depletion region) 
V = 0, SCR region edge: xno∀xpo 

2. Under thermal equilibrium:

Minority electron concentration in p-QNR:npo =

Hole concentration in p-QNR:ppo = Na

Nd
Electron concentration in n-QNR:nno = Nd

Minority hole concentration in n-QNR:pno =

The hole concentration and minority electron concentrations are constant throughout
QNR.

What happens when V = 0?

V > 0

What can we say about the minority carrier concentration at the SCR edges ?
It turns out the relationship
pno = ppo · e

The “law of the junction” relates the minority carrier concentration at the SCR edge with
important
the equilibrium minority carrier concentration and the applied bias (60 mV/dec)
Some notes:

1. This is so only for the concentration at the SCR edge

2. For V > 0, this is usually called “minority carrier injection” because from the “law of
the junction” relationship, by lowering the barrier, more ma jority carriers from one
side move across the SCR and add on to the minority carriers on the other side
↓
3. This can also be understood from the fact that, when V > 0, E , Jdrift < Jdiﬀ , more

→
n, and more e− can diﬀuse from n
holes can diﬀuse from p
p
4.  Low Level Injection : pn < nno and np < ppo (minority < ma jority) in order to have
valid law of the junction

5. What about the minority carrier concentration at other locations inside the QNR?
•  At the contact (wn , −wp ):
since recombination/generation occurs very fast,
carrier concentration in equilibrium
• Inside QNR: we will talk about this on Thursday 
So now we have two data-points 

In Scale

Ratio remains the same:

np (−xp )
pn (−xn )

npo=
pno

V < 0

Applying law of the junction:
pn (xn ) = Na e−(φB−V)/Vth = Na e
V
= pno e Vth
np (−xp ) = npo e Vth

Equations are the same, but since V < 0 this time, instead of having “minority carrier
injection”, we have “minority carrier extraction”.

The picture regarding minority carrier concentration: 

Exercise
Na = 1018 cm−3 , Nd = 1016 cm−3 . Calculate minority carrier concentration at the SCR edge
for V = 0, V = −0.12 V, V = 0.6 V First,

pn (xn ) = pno · 1010 = 1014 cm−3 (cid:7) Nd = 1016 cm−3

At what point is Low Level Injection valid?
Let pn (xn ) = Nd = 1016 , eV/Vth = 1012 , =⇒ V = 12 × 60 = 720 mV
