Recitation 9: MOSFET VI Characteristics

Before the class ﬁrst do an exercise on MOS capacitor.

Under T.E., suppose we are under depletion, positive charges at M-O interface, negative
charges (Na− ) at O-S interface & depletion region xdo .

How does the C-V measurement curve look like?

Where is Cmin? When VGB changes, Cox does not change. Cd changes due to xd (VGB ).

xd = 0 at VFB ,
⇒
xd = xd,max at VT = Cmin
In tutorial, you can also ﬁnd what the GV curves look like for p+ − n MOS or p+ − p MOS,
or n+ − n MOS.

MOSFET Device
•  We only talked about 2 terminals in our MOS capacitor. Where are the other termi-
→
nals? Source/Drain. In the MOS capacitor, S/D tie to bulk
ground.

•  As we mentioned, VGB =⇒ VG − VB . In MOSFET, we usually have,
VDS = VD − VS 
VGS = VG − VS 
You can do manipulation: VGD = VG − VD = VGS − VDS
•  If the substrate of MOSFET is p-type, what type of MOSFET device this is? n-MOS
or p-MOS? 
It is n-MOS. MOSFET operates when it is in Inversion. So for n-MOS: Source/Drain 
are n+ . Thus we have two p − n+ junctions between source-substrate (bulk), n+ (D) 
and p (B). When we apply biases, we try to keep VBS ≤ 0, VBD ≤ 0 otherwise the 
p − n+ junction will conduct. 
•  When we use n-MOS, we always try to use source as reference: VGS , VDS etc. To start
⇒
with, we let VBS = 0 = VGB = VGS

From yesterday’s discussion or 6.002, what are the I-V characteristics (i.e. when
applying VDS , what does IDS look like) of a n-MOS?

1. Remember we need to apply positive  VGB (i.e. VGS here) in order to reach
threshold. Before threshold, no conduction.
⇒
= VGS < VT , IDS = 0 always (cutoﬀ )

2.  VGS ≥ VT , now we have inversion layer. If the VDS = 0, what is the inversion
layer charge density? 
|Qn | = Cox (VGS − VT )

When VDS > 0, how will this charge density change? Now from S to D, along
the channel interface, potential is no longer 0.
V (y) =(cid:6)
0(0 < y < L) at each location y
∴, |Qn (y)| = Cox (VGS − V (y) − VT )
Decrease from source(y = 0)V (y) = 0 to minimum at D(y = L, V (L) = VDS ).

To calculate IDS remember current ∝ charge density, ∝ carrier velocity.
IDS = W · |Qn (y)| · vy (y) (vy (y)
is velocity in the y direction at location y)
·
How to calculate vy (y)? v = μ E . So need to know Ey (y). How to know Ey (y)?

(1)

Ey (y) =

dV (y)
dy

(we have V (x, y) at each location: dV will give Ex )
dx

Therefore to plug everything in the equation (1)
IDS = w · Cox (VGS − V (y) − VT ) · μn · dV
(y)
dy

PMOSFET Case 

Will need VBS ≥ 0, VBD ≥ 0 always. (typically VBS = 0). Now in order to have inversion:

In p-MOS, we use

VGB = VGS < 0

VSG = VS − VG > 0
VSD = VS − VD > 0
