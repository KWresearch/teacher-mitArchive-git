Recitation 2: Equilibrium Electron and Hole 
Concentration from Doping 

Here is a list of new things we learned yesterday:
1. Electrons and Holes

2. Generation and Recombination

3. Thermal Equilibrium

4. Law of Mass Action

5. Doping - (donors and acceptors) and charge neutrality

6. Intrinsic Semiconductor vs. Extrinsic Semiconductor

7. Ma jority and Minority carriers

1 Electrons and Holes

This refers to the “free” electrons and holes. They carry charges (electron -ve and hole +ve),
and are responsible for electrical current in the semiconductor. Concentration of electron
(= n) and hole (= p) is measured in the unit of /cm+3 or cm−3 (per cubic centimeter).
Remember in Si the atomic density is 5 × 1022 cm−3 , very useful number

2 Generation and Recombination

Generation is one way to obtain “free” e & h in semiconductors. 1 electron-hole pair (1e +
1h) is generated by breaking a bond. Recombination is the reverse process.

3 Thermal Equilibrium

A concept which will be used very often. Thermal equilibrium is deﬁned as steady state +
no extra energy source. Note that we have generation or recombination under thermal equi-
librium. It is just that the two rates are equal and cancel each other, so the concentrations
of e & h do not change. n o and p o refer to concentrations in thermal equilibrium.

4 Law of Mass Action

At each temperature T, under thermal equilibrium:
no · po = constant = f (T ) (only depends on temperature)
no · po = ni
(ni ≡ intrinsic carrier concentration)

This is like a chemical reaction:
H20 (cid:2) H+ + OH−
bond (cid:2) e− + h+

[H + ][OH − ] = 10−14 (mol/L)2 at Room T
no · po = ni (T ) = 1020 (cm−3 )2 at Room T

Note ni has a temperature dependence:

2kBT
(T )3/2
ni = A
e
A is a constant, T is in Kelvin, T (K) = 273 + T(◦C), and kB = 8.62 × 10−5 eV/K. EG is the
“Bandgap” energy of the semiconductor - it also corresponds to the ease of bond breakage.
For Si, EG = 1.12 eV.

Example 1
At room temperature, T = 300 K, ni (300 K) = 1 × 1010 cm−3 . What is ni (500 ◦C)?

Doping and Charge Neutrality

Doping

free electrons 
generated by As

n type dopants: As, P, Sb
give out an electron easily 
leave behind a positively charged ion
Donor concentration Nd (cm-3)

a hole generated due to bond 
breaking and e- given to B-

p type dopants: B
have one less electron, will grab one
easily from another place, become 
negatively  charged and thus generate a hole
Acceptor concentration Na (cm-3)

Figure 1: Types of Doping

Charge neutrality

Although foreign atoms are introduced in Si, the overall semiconductor is charge neutral.
Therefore, concentration of positive charges = concentration of negative charges. The pos-
itive charges include holes (p) and donors (Nd ). The negative charges include electrons (n)
and acceptors (Na ).
po + Nd − no − Na = 0

Example 2
Boron doping, dopant concentration 1017 cm−3 . 
At R.T. under thermal equilibrium Nd =? Na =? no =? po =? ni =? p or n type? 
Boron is an acceptor meaning Na = 1017 cm−3 , Nd = 0.
ni = 1010 cm−3 at R.T. under thermal equilibrium (material property, doping does not matter)
po (cid:4) Na = 1017 cm−3 (because Na (cid:5) ni )
1020 cm−6
∵ no · po = 1020 cm−6 , no =
1017 cm−3 = 103 cm−3

Intrinsic Semiconductor vs. Extrinsic Semiconductor

In the above example, the semiconductor is extrinsic because the carrier concentrations
are determined by the dopant concentrations.

Example 3
Si at 500 ◦C, with As doping 1018 cm−3 , extrinsic or intrinsic?
At 500 ◦C, ni (773 K) = 3.5 × 1016 cm−3 > Nd 
It is intrinsic semiconductor even though there is doping. 

Example 4
⇒
A semiconductor can have both dopings. If Na = 1015 cm−3 , Nd = 1019 cm−3 = n-type
Si, no (cid:5) po even though we have Na = 1015 cm−3 . 
When things get complicated, the following relations always work: 
po + Nd − no − Na = 0
no · po = ni

is minority carrier.
