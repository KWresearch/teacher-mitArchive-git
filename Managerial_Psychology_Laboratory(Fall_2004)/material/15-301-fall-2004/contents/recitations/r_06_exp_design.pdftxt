Experimental design

Experiments are the most common and

useful way to determine causality.


The question is: how to design them?


What is a good experiment? 


Hard to say...    Experimentation is partially  an 
art form! 
But, in general, a good experiment is one that 
controls for everything else -- testing only 
what you want it to test 
Planned well in advance 
Controlling for other plausible hypotheses 

The ﬁrst experiment

An Early Experimental Design: “Dew it both ways” Judges 
(Shoftim) Chapter 6 

And Gideon said to G-d:


“If You will save Israel by my hand, as You have said, look, I will put a ﬂeece of wool 
on the threshing-ﬂoor ; if there be dew on the ﬂeece only, and it be dry upon all 
the ground, then shall I know that You will save Israel by my hand, as You have 
said.” 

And it was so; for he rose up early on the next day, and pressed the ﬂeece 
together, and wrung dew out of the ﬂeece, a bowlful of water. 

And Gideon said to G-d: “Do not be angry with me, and I will speak just this once: 
let me try just once more, I ask You, with the ﬂeece; let it now be dry only upon 
the ﬂeece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.” 

And G-d did so that night; for it was dry upon the ﬂeece only, and there was dew 
on all the ground. 

An experiment vs. experiments


Any experiment is a step in a dialog 
Experiments build on each other 
No experiment is the ultimate one

Industry standards

Elegance

Symmetry

Many ways to measure the same idea


What is convincing evidence?


Single cell designs


Not an experiment -- a study 
Parameter estimations 
Theory test
 Examples: economics, physics
 Creating a control group from the single cell 
Examples: ordering simulation in variety

seeking


Random assignment 


Random assignment is the central aspect of 
experiments 
By randomly assigning subjects to groups we 
can assume no systematic differences between 
groups 
Assume they are the same on everything but 
the manipulation. 

The importance of

manipulations


By using a manipulation you can determine the 
direction of causality 

Based also on random assignment we can link 
the outcome to our manipulation

Experimental design: summary


Experimental design is about the design of the 
structure of the experiment 
The origins of this is in agriculture

Without a good design it is hard to know for 
sure what we have learned
