Survey design
&
Taking measurements

Lets try ...
• Make up a question to ask anything 
you want to know about MIT students 
(do not use a yes / no question 
format)
• Write down your question and its 
response scale
• Examples ...
• Turn to your neighbor and present 
your questions to each other
– Why this question, why this 
response scale etc.

"File drawer" view: 
– Attitudes are stable dispositions that are 
stored in long-term memory, and you just 
retrieve them
"The constructive" view:
– Attitudes are constructed on the fly, 
computed when necessary from whatever 
information comes to mind

Do people interpret the question as 
intended?
• What brand of soft drink do you typically 
buy?
– What is the time period involved?  (How far back do I go … I 
bought Gatorade in the summer; Hi C when I was a kid)
– Do purchases at movies, in restaurants, & sporting events 
count?
– Does "you" refer to me or to my household?
– What is a "soft drink" exactly?
• do lemonade, iced tea, fruit punch, & mineral water count?
– Are Coke and Cherry Coke the same brand?

How do people select 
responses?
• How successful are you?
–  on a scale from 1 to 10?
–
Is 10 the valedictorian of your high 
school? Ted Turner? Michael Jordan?

3 cognitive stages in 
answering questions
To design a good question you MUST be certain 
that people can
1) Interpret your question as you want them to
2) Access the relevant information
3) Map their response on the scale in a 
meaningful and consistent (across and between 
people) way

Other examples ….

Ef fects of scales:
• In many cases the scales we give 
people are not ones they are used to 
think about (even hours of watching 
TV)
• In such cases people use the scales to 
determine the acceptable range and 
their subjective fit within the range 
to determine their response

Ef fects of scales:
• The constructive view of preferences:
– People do not know but if you ask them 
they will give you an answer
– And they will be sure about it
– But …..
• In some cases people”learn” about 
themselves from their own answers

Question Order I
1) How satisfied are you with your life overall? 

2) How is the weather? How satisfied are you 
with your life overall?
–
– In one of these conditions, was there a strong 
correlation between current weather (whether 
it was raining outside or sunny) and people's 
appraisal of their life as a whole.
– In which of these two conditions was the 
correlation observed.

Question Order II
1a) How many dates did you have last 
month?
1b) How satisﬁed are you with your life, 
in general?

•

2a) How satisﬁed are you with your life, 
in general?
2b) How many dates did you have last 
month?

Response language
• Asking questions is a part of a 
discussion
• People make assumptions about 
the intended meaning
• Think about what the question 
suggests / assumes / implies in 
the context of a conversation  

Summary
• The way we ask questions can 
have a large effect on how 
people understand the questions, 
interpret them, and ultimately 
answer them
• Be careful!!!

Extracting sensitive 
information

Extracting sensitive information I

1) Do you happen to have done X in 
the last year?
2a) As you know, many people have 
been doing X these days.  Do you 
happen to have done X?
2b) Do you know anyone who has 
done X?  How about yourself?

Extracting sensitive information II
Pull a coin from your pocket.  If it lands Heads, answer 
Question 1.  If it lands Tails answer Question 2:
1. Is your birthday between Jan 1st  and June 1st ?
2. Have you ever done X?

Sensitive information
• Much of the information we are 
interested is sensitive
• More so as people get more 
suspicious!
• There are workarounds
• In many cases it is recommended 
to try and estimate the effect 
of hiding information

Lets go back ...
• Look back at the question you 
wrote earlier.  Is there anything 
that you would change?
• Even better...
• Look back at the question your 
neighbor wrote earlier.  Is there 
anything that you would change?

questions

range, working, expectation etc.)
