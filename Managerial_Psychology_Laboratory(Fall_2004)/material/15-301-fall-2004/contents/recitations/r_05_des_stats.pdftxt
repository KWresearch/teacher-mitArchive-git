What scales do we have?

In most cases when asking people for
their opinions researchers behave as
if they have ratio scales, wishing they
had interval scales but in fact in most
cases we only have  ordinal scales

Luckily many of the statistical tools we
use are not very sensitive to the
violation of this assumption

Granularity of scales

It is impor tant to use measurement
scales that people find meaningful

If people can distinguish only 3 (7)
levels, there is not much use in a 100
point scale

Descriptive statistics

The goal of statistics is to

Report data in meaningful ways

Make predictions about future events

Central tendencies

• Representing central
tendencies of distributions is a
very efﬁcient way to
understand something about it.
• Mode
• Median
• Mean

The Mode

• The most “popular” frequent occurring
instance in the sample.
– This is the only central tendency that can be
used with a nominal scale
• The mode is sensitive to aggregation of
categories
– Age 18 vs age 18-21
• Sometimes there are multiple modes
– Bimodal distributions

The Median

• The median is a value which 1/2 of the values
are above it and 1/2 below
• After sorting the values by magnitude, the
median is at the (n+1)/2 location
• 123, 85, 34, 20, 18, 15, 14  ?
• 123, 85, 34, 20, 18, 15  ?
• When data is grouped, calculating the mode is
a bit more complex

The Mean

• Mean = (Xi) /n
• The most important statistic
• Used for many other computations
• Stable
– Smallest mean square deviations from it
• Sensitive to extreme values
• Not “well behaved’ in non-standard
distributions

Distribution descriptors

• The Range
– The range is (Max - Min)
–
–
• Interquartile range
– Calculating is similar to median 
– Q3-Q1 (1/2 of the observations)

Variation I

• Variance (^2)
– (Xi-µ)^2/(n)
– (Xi-µ)^2/(n-1)
• Standard deviation ()
– Square root of variance
– Standard deviation is in the same units
as the distribution

Variation II

• Variance ( ^2) is:
• insensitive to transformations
consisting of adding a constant.
• sensitive to transformations consisting
of multiplying by a constant.

When to use

When should you use the:
Mean
Mode
Median

The Correlation

• The relationship between 2 variables
does not have to be linear
– But in many cases they are
• Positive and negative correlations

What is a correlation?

• What line to pick?
– Sum of all deviations from the line is 0
– The sum of square deviations of the points from
the line is minimal.

Types of
measurements

Two types of measures

Subjective
Introspection
Intuitions
Opinions

Objective
Behavioral
What people actually do

Two types of measures

Examples:
How much do you enjoy this class?
Who came to class today?

Subjective vs. objective: which is
better?  Why?

Objective measures

Objective measures

Observing behavior (parking, men's room)
Choice
Payments, bids, etc
Time in task

Limited to things we can observe
“Statistically expensive” in many cases (choice)
Usually harder to get

Par tial objective measures

We can ask people for the their
opinions but ask them to use objective
scales.

How much time have you used for
action X

How much will you pay

How much energy will you expand

Statistically expensive?

No

Yes

Subjective measures

Subjective measures

Intentions

What would you do

What would others do

Attitudes

How much do you like X?

Verbal repor ts

On-line introspections

Quantitative subjective measures
Quantitative  objective

Liker t scales (1-7; 1-10; 1-100)

Guttman scale

A yes no response to a continuum of
questions that are ordinal

Hypothetical choice

Ranking

Subjective measures I

Very popular
Cheap
Can tell us things we cannot observe (why..)

Depend on interpretation
Intuitions & not behavior
Depends on the extend to which people can
introspect

Subjective measures II

Social desirability demands

How of ten do you cheat?

Would you steal if you were sure no one will catch
you?

Would you rather watch “the piano” or Rambo?

Demand characteristics (ef fects)

Do you agree that red is a nice color?

Types of measurement summary I

Objective and subjective
measurements

Each has its advantages and
disadvantages

Beware of subjective measures if your
goal is to predict behavior

Types of measurement summary II

Subjective vs. objective (behavioral measures)
The main question is what are people able to
report
Sensitivity to scales, order, etc.
Response language
The constructive view
Do people have preferences?
Inferences of attitudes from questions /
answers

Measurements

Objective measures are usually
easier to make inferences from

But, even with objective measures it
is impor tant to think what is
measured and how it relates to the
question of interest

Descriptive stats
A compact way to represent the main
essence about the data

What is this main essence depends on
the measurements and on the data

Each method has +s and -s

There are no rules for what method to
pick -- do your best! it is your
responsibility
