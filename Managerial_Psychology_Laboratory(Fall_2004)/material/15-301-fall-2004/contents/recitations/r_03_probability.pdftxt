Probability 

An introduction 

Probability�

Probability theory presents a 
systematic way to think about�
outcomes in a stochastic world 
Without probability it would be 
hard to say if an event is likely to 
occur or not 

Examples I�

What is the probability of:�
A newborn will be male? 

Getting HH in a coin toss? 

Getting a particular face on a die? 
In a bag with 1 red, 1 green and 3 blue�
balls. What is the probability to draw a 1) 
red ball, 2) a red or a blue ball? 

Probability & Frequency�

Binomial distributions�

Binomial distributions�

These are distributions for cases where 
the outcomes have only 2 possible states�
This is the simplest form of probability 
distribution 

Examples? 

Note, the state of each event are binary, 
but we could talk about sets of events�

Think of 2 coins�

What are the possible outcomes if we ﬂip 
2 coins?

Other binomial distributions�

Binomial Distribution 60/40 I�

•�A dramatic disease causes death in 60% 
of the cases, & only 40% people survive. 
•�What is the likelihood that 10 out of 10 
people survive? 
•�
•�Only one possible way to get 10 / 10 
.4 * .4 * .4 * .4 * .4 * .4 * .4 * .4 * .4 * .4 =.0001 

Binomial Distribution 60/40 II�

•�A dramatic disease causes death in 60% 
of the cases, & only 40% people survive. 
•�What is the likelihood that 9 out of 10 
people survive? 

Number of combinations�

How many different committees of 5 people 
can you have from a group of 6 people? 

How many different committees of 8 people 
can you have from a group of 10 people? 

How many different committees of 2 people 
can you have from a group of 10 people? 

Number of possible ways = n!/[r!(n-r)!]

Binomial Distribution 60/40 II�

•�A dramatic disease causes death in 60% 
of the cases, & only 40% people survive. 
•�What is the likelihood that 9 out of 10 
people survive? 

Calculating bonomial probabilities�

P(r out of n) = number of possible ways one�
could get r out of n X probability of each way�
Number of possible ways = n!/[r!(n-r)!]�
P(9 out of 10) = 

0.4^(r) x 0.6^(n-r) = 0.4^9 x 0.6^1 = 0.000157 

10!/9!1!=10 

P(9 out of 10) = 0.00157 

Binomial Distribution 60/40 II�

•  A dramatic disease causes death in 60%�
of the cases. Only 40% people survive.�
•�What is the likelihood that at least 7 out 
of 10 people survive? 

• 

A bit more complex ... 

Calculating bonomial probabilities�

P(r out of n) = number of possible ways X 
Probability of each way 
Number of possible ways = n!/[r!(n-r)!]�
P(7 out of 10) = 

0.4^(r) x 0.6^(n-r) = 0.4^7 x 0.6^3 = 
0.00035389 
10!/7!3!=120�
P(7 out of 10) = 0.0425�

7 or more out of 10?�

7 out of 10 + 8 out of 10 + 9 out of 10 + 
10 out of 10 

When we calculate the probability of an 
outcome (7), most times we calculate the 
probaility of the outcome or a more 
extreme outcome 

Binomial summary�

By using the binomial distribution we 
can directly calculate the probability of 
an event (or a more extreme set of events) 

We can compare this probability to 0.05 
and decide if it is signiﬁcant or not 

This can be very tedious if we want to c 
calculate the probability of a range of 
possible events (x or more extreme) 

Calculating  probabilities�

Calculating probabilities I�

6 coins tossed:�
 n = 6;  p = .5;  q = .5�
Theoretical mean (µ) = np = 6 * .5 = 3�
The mean is the expected (unbiased) central�
tendency of the distribution�

Calculating probabilities II�

When we calculate the distributions there are 
other measures we can easily get 

Variance (^2) = n *p*q 
Standard deviation =  
z = (r-µ) /  
The z score is very important because it 
will give us the probability of event r 

Z scores�

z = (r-µ) / �
Z for 6 heads is? 
z = (6-3) / 1.225 = 2.45 

Look for  z = 2.45 in the Normal distribution 
table.  What is the p? 

Please calculate I�

If you observe that 44 of the 50 infants that 
were born at MGH yesterday were females, 
what could you argue? 

What probability would you give to this 
event? 

Would you argue that the probability of 
females being born at MGH is above 50%? 

Answer I�

n = 50; p = 0.5; q = 0.5 
Theoretical mean (µ) = np = 50 * .5 = 25 

Variance (^2) = n *p*q = 12.5 
Standard deviation =  = 3.53 
z = (r-µ) /  = (44-25) / 3.53 = 5.38 

Please calculate II�

If you observe that 10 of the 12 times a 
roulette wheel landed on red, what could you 
argue? 

What probability would you give to this 
event? 

Would you argue that the probability of the 
roulette wheel landing on red is above 50%? 

Answer II�

n = 12; p = 0.5; q = 0.5�
Theoretical mean (µ) = np = 12 * .5 = 6�
Variance (^2) = n *p*q = 3�
Standard deviation =  = 1.73 
z = (r-µ) /  = (10-6) / 1.73 = 2.31 

Calculating binomial probabilities�

We do this by considering the distributional 
probabilities of the binomial distribution. 

Which is close to the normal distribution 

This lets us calculate the probability of a 
range! 

Compound Probabilities�

Disjunctive probabilities linked by addition�
A or B�

Conjunctive probabilities are linked by�
joint occurrence�
A and B�

Linda�

Linda is vegetarian, she wears sandals even in 
the winter, she is active in the women literary�
society, and her hair usually needs a trim.�
Please write down the probability of the�
following:�
1) Linda is a bank-teller 

2) Linda is a feminist bank-teller 

Linda�

Conjunction: X and

 Y means lower probability

In a bag with 1 red, 1 green and 3 blue 
balls. What is the likelihood that you draw a 
red or a blue ball? 
Disjunctive probabilities are simple -- they 
are the probability of the  joint event 

More disjunctive questions�

10% of the students are always late to 15.301 

25% of the students shower at least once a 
week 

What is the likelihood that a student drawn at 
random will be tardy or clean student? 

What is the likelihood that a student drawn at 
random will be a late or unclean student? 

Disjunctive summary�

Disjunctive probabilities use the word or, but 
mean the probability or either (both). 

It is important to note whether the events are 
independent or not -- what is the overlap 
between the events.

Conjunctive summary�

Conjunctive probabilities use the word and, 
but mean the joint probability. 

It is important to note whether the events are 
independent or not -- what is the overlap 
between the events. 

Central limit theorem�

This is about the behavior of real data!�

Approximations of true distribution improves 
when number of single samples increases 

As we take more sets of samples, the 
distribution of samples better approximate 
the normal distribution
