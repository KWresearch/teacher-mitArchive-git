Recitation 6: Descriptive Statistics 

What wrong with giving survey in class? 
-select by people who come to class. 
Is something wrong with that? 
-more people come to exam 

some people come earlier, some people come later, maybe we want to think about that 
when giving the survey 

Today we talk about a most exciting topic - Measurement 

In general, we think there are 4 types of scales: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. 

And those have diff properties and diff ways to think about them


nominal scale 

just a label, doesn’t tell us bigger or smaller, no order, can’t infer any relationship 

such as gender – no order 

or bus number – some people take bus 1, some bus 15.  we know anything about bus 1?

No, just labels 

can think of others?

-student ID#  

Assume random

-U/G 

No, because we know one is more than the other.  Grad degree, means also got u degree, 

it is more.  Doesn’t mean learned more, but more yrs of school 


How about days of the week – nominal?

No, we know about relationship. Tues comes 2 days after Sunday  

What else? 

-ethnicity 

-what city you are from 

Is this actually nominal? 

This is a very good point though 

You can think about things as being nominal, and we can think of them as having some

relationship. 

Think about cities – we know east or west coast. From LA, SF, we know something 

about the cities, so is a relationship 

-any nominal label – alphabetical 

That’s right.  Big issue is what is nominal Depends on our goal 

Ex. Say I think women nicer than men, I could say gender is not a nominal scale if we 

think about niceness 

All about the question – what is the thing you want to use it for? 


Bus numbers 
Could be Cambridge has some system for bus #s 
Buildings at MIT – nominal? 
Look random, but  some logic somewhere.  At least some of the numbers 

For those things, it would be not nominal 

Nominal – no particular use 
Think about it – put on x axis, switch around and it would not make any difference. 

Switch in any way want – no difference 

Ordinal Scale 

Is continuity in number, but only continuity in the # 

In fact, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales all have continuity in the data, but depend on 

different description of this data 


Ordinal – knowing one, know is bigger than something else 

Know house #17 is further away than #15, but don’t know by how much.  Don’t know  

how big distance 


Interval scale – intervals the same between 


Ratio Scale – intervals between same plus there is a meaningful zero. 


Why we care about meaningful zero? 

-neutral pt

Ok, but why do we care about it? 


Multiply things and is meaningful 


Think about deg F, think about today, 50 degrees.  And then – oh, today is 100.  is it 

twice as hot as yesterday? No. 0 not a meaningful 0 


What if heart rate 40, exercise, goes up to 80.  would we say heart rate has doubled?

Absolutely. 0 is meaningful pt, so can double numbers, divide them, keep their meaning. 


Ratio scale Allows to measure in percentages 


What are some ratio scales? 

-population 

Meaningful zero and 75 people is 5 more than 70, etc (interval) 

-Kelvin temp scale 

-price

0, know what is.  If $1, half as much as $2

-typing 
WPM 
Time spend in morning getting ready 
Number pencils in your hair 

Lets talk about interval scale 
Graduation scale but without a meaningful zero. 

Mostly physical measurements 
Distance, time, weight 

-voltage.  Comparing, not consistent zero 
I lack knowledge in that domain.  Likely 

Am I hot or not is a great website 

2 undergrads Started program, sitting in coffee shop watching people walking by.  Made 
a program that is like people walking by. See pictures of people, rate them 
I have my picture posted on that site 
I don’t look very often. 
First looked, very disappointed, then rating went up 
We have lots of data from them 
Anybody seen the adds in SF? 
The two founders, naked with the laptops in front of their… where their underwear would 
be and it shows their real rating.  Not real attractive 

Was slight deviation 

Interval scale or ordinal scale?  We know 5 is more than 4.  but do we know if 7 from 6 is 
same as 4 from 3?  Diff in 2 scales is if intervals are of equal size on scale 

Clearly not ratio scale 
The reason this is so important is in a lot of these scales we do research – how happy are 
you feeling, how attractive do you find this person, how likely are you to buy this thing? 

-ordinal equal size, interval… or other way around? 

Ordinal means one is more than the other, but we don’t know the size of the differences 

Interval also gets bigger, but the amount of the step is always the same. 

Then ratio has all properties of previous 2 plus a meaningful zero 

Thing about scales is we can use them statistically.  
Can you take an average of a nominal scale? 
Anyone say no? 

15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Recitation 6 3/1/2005 
Page 3 of 15 

Anyone say yes? 

Looks odd to take average of nominal scale. 

If I code every female in this class as 1 and every male as 0 and take the average, what 

would I get? 

Proportional number of people in the class 

Usually people say nominal scale can’t take average of 

Which is often true 


Bus 1, bus 15, can’t say something about bus 8, meaningless 


Apt numbs, harder to imagine, but some cases might make sense 


All depends on what scale you have and what you need to know 


Year when something founded – what scale? 


-interval 

Why not ratio?

0 defined by part religion.  If think of nothing existing before, but existing after, but 

otherwise not meaningful 0 


Altitude.  What is alt? 

-ratio 

yeah 


Population? 

-ratio 


Sad point about these scales 

And the reason I emphasize them so much – is that in most cases when you ask for 

peoples opinions on these scales, we behave as if ratio scale.  Double, say people at MIT 

twice as happy as people at Harvard.  Nevertheless, these scales not always ratio scales. 

Every time we double, we make the assumption is ratio, but is not always ratio. 

Many cases, behave as if ratio scale, wishing have interval scale, but in most cases we 

only have ordinal scale.  1-10 scales, hard to assume each step is same size.  Means all 

we have is ordinal.  The happy thing is we have stats.  More people we get, even though 

only have ordinal scale, treat as ratio scale, a lot of stats are indifferent to this assumption 

Good to try to think about making ratio or interval scale, but even if we don’t, we have 

some help 


What scales do we have? (slide) 


Most cases, only have ordinal scales 


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Recitation 6 3/1/2005 
Page 4 of 15 

Luckily statistics – go into next time 

Not good to do better to think about scales, but some help out there 

Sometimes ask very small resolution.  On scale 1-1000, how do you feel today?

Usually crazy.  Many cases, people can’t distinguish that level of happiness  


Know scales, now move to descriptive stats 

Basic pt w/ stats is the following – very hard to see all kinds of numbers 

Lots of them out there 

So let’s say PD (red sox pitcher, Pedro Martinez)  

People batting against him get .209 


Why say?  Why not give all the numbers? 

How many people, thousands?

Lots of zeros, some 1s 

Very hard to figure out this data, right? 

But by 1 number, can get info from these numbers  

Now, is this 1 number hiding some information? 

Are there missing things from this number?

-yeah 

Like what?

-standard deviation 

Can calculate that, you remember?  What is standard deviation?  You know what?  I  

think that is a good thing, you will have all kinds of ?’s on the exam based on this 

What is probability that Red Sox will win series? 

-1 
Outside of wishful thinking, how calculate the probability?  See how useful this class is?

You learned something, and now you can use it.  

-15/16 

How calculated?

-assume ½ chance of winning each game 

4 in a row, multiply 

Happen unless cardinals win all 4 games. 

.5*.5*.5*.5 

Cardinals chances.  1 minus that for Red Sox. 


Statistics – represent something, but also hides a lot of information 

Example – Pedro Martinez 

Get better over time? 

Get worse? 

Bad some days? random?


We have a lot of responsibility as the reporters to report what is relevant 


Wrong to report one aspect  


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Recitation 6 3/1/2005 
Page 5 of 15 

Hiding info by doing things like describing stats with 1 number. 

Can compare better to other people, useful, but 

Careful not to hide important aspects 


Describing a state (slide) 


Started – some royalty interested in gambling 

Wanted someone to teach them how to  


Ex slide 

How much you like 15.301?

If take average, hides some data 

Compare classes – how many people attend 15.301 vs course 1 class? 

Not real data, by the way 


Average is the one you are most familiar with. 

Give example for averages used in daily life 

-average time get to class 

-hours of sleep 

GPA 

-number of emails you send  


We do all these things with averages, or mean.  I want to present 2 others, the mode and 

the median. 


Mode - most popular occurrence in the data 


Think about ages 

Could be average age here is 23.  but could be most people 18 and some people are 80  

Average very diff picture than mode. 


Why want to know mode?

-focus on as part of group 

Where does most of the data fall?  This can be very important 


Sometimes multiple modes – some 18, some 80, none in the middle 

Bimodal dist 

Median numb exactly halfway between lowest, highest number. 

Can confuse w/ average, mean, but is not the mean. 

Sort by order and find central person 

Why is not the mean? 

What is the mode in this first example. We say, there are 7 numbers… we go 1, 2, 3, and 

the next is the one in the middle 

What is difference – this approach and approach to find average? 

Talking about central person. 


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Recitation 6 3/1/2005 
Page 6 of 15 

What is the median here? (slide) 
-27 
if no middle person, take mid 2, halfway in between 
Some other tricks.  For example, what if we have 
123 85 24 24 24 20 18 15 2 1 
How calc median under those conditions? 
Between 24, 20, but are three 24s, one 20 
Could slide in relative proportion, divide space not evenly 

The Mean 
The average, most used stat  

Very compact, basis of every stat we will go over later 


Problems with this 

Outliers – vastly skew dist of ages if a couple far from average 


But has nice properties for computation 

In papers, will plot some things 


Plots I (slide) 

People solved  q1, q2 correct in imaginary test 


What see in data? 

Any pattern? 

How do you interpret? 


Over time, people improve in q1, q 2 not much improvement

Emphasize diff things w/ type of graph – line graph, bar graph, etc 


Accepted standard: 

w/ nominal scales, not use line graphs 

it would be arbitrary 

doesn’t mean ordinal, interval scales have to be line graphs, but very unconventional to 

use line graphs for nominal data. 


Plots II 


Pie charts, first impression probability of different segments 

Stack bars - Joint effect of 2 years gives effect of both years together 


Went over mean, median, mode, now look at  

How these things change depending on what the distribution is like. 

In this distribution, where is mean, mode, median? 


All Exactly in middle  


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Recitation 6 3/1/2005 
Page 7 of 15 

This bimodal distribution? Where will the mean be? 

Mean in middle 

2 modes  

Median in center 


Try to describe data, take complex patterns and summarize for people 

We are telling a story, look, we have all this data and we’re just going to summarize it for 

you in some meaningful way  

It is your job to understand what the full story is and therefore you want to look at it in a 

variety of different ways and only then figure out what the most important aspect and 

summarize those 

Surprisingly subjective endeavor 

Why does baseball use mean?  Should’t you want to care what is the likelihood of 

strikeouts that PD will have in the next game? Would be mode, not mean. 


Very different stories from the data 


When have data, recommend you plot it.  Then figure most important aspects, summarize 

those 


One more example, shifted to right.  Lots have B, few people have A 

What would be mean, mode, median? 

What easiest? 

-mode 

Mean, median shifted to the right. 

Shifted to infinity, mean would go to infinity 

More extreme, mean more to the right  


Distribution Descriptors  (slide) 


Other useful statistics 

Range –the mean to the max 

Another mean to max idea called the interquarter range 

Instead of calculating 1 median, calculate 3 medians 

Take median, then on each side of the median take another median 

So you end up with 4 portions, divided out by the 3 medians 

Drop top and bottom quarter, just deal with the 2 in between 

Focus on middle quarters 


Lets say math exam

Some great at math, some just write 0 and go away, not try  

Use this to find range of people who took it seriously, and find the mean of those exams  


Variance, already talked about 


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Recitation 6 3/1/2005 
Page 8 of 15 

How mean, median, mode relate to scales we talked about? 

Which can use for each scale? 


Nominal scale 

-Mode 

Use mode, doesn’t make sense to use anything else 


What about ordinal scale?

-Mode, median 

Mode used for every one  


Interval scale? 

Use all 


Ratio scale – all 


Correlation – the relationship between 2 variables 


(Slide)

Hour in morning vs performance in 15.301 

See people wake up early don’t do as well 


Have all these data points.  How can we describe with line?

Find line that minimizes distances to it 

Kind of like an average, but an average line 


Will Show 6 correlations

0 completely unrelated 

1 match exactly  

Want you to guess the correlation 

(slides) 

Write correlations 


How close were you in guessing?


Most people completely miss the first few, think really not much correlation there 

Most people find correlation of .3 hard to grasp  

Biased against order.  Don’t think there’s as much order in the data as there really is 


-doesn’t correlation calculation depend on equation for line? 

That’s right.  When we say correlation, assume linear  

Life much more complex than linear relation between 2 lines, then have to look at 

different equation 

Fit different function

Very good point 

Talked about the 4 scales 
Talked about distribution 
Range 
variance 

Final thing bring to your attention, objective vs subjective measurements 

Presidential Election – truly meaningless statistics 
Do we need to see another survey that tells us the range is within the margin of error? 

2 types of measurement 

subjective, objective 

subjective measures: things that there is no external way to know whether they are true or 
not 
How happy does color red make you? 
No objective way for me to know how happy the color red makes you 
Subj. measurement.  You are the ultimate judge, no other way to go about it 

Intuitions, 
Baseball game – will they win tonight? You might be right or wrong, but 
If give me best guess, I can’t tell if is your best guess or not.  Only w/in your mind are 
these numbers created, no way for me to evaluate objectively 
Opinion, all of these are the same 

Objective, look at behavior, I can see your behavior.  And sometimes people do other 
than what they say they do 
Many cases, this is better 

If I ask how much you enjoy this class, 5 pt scale, is it objective or subjective? 
Subjective, it’s got all kinds of problems. 

Measure who showed up to class 
Objective but not necessarily correlated 
Maybe it’s not the people who like it, but people who hate it so much, they want to fuel 
their hatred by anecdotes.  Or if someone has a good friend who is coming to class.  
Doesn’t have to be correlated, but it is an objective measure. 

So which is better?  Subjective? Objective? 

-objective, don’t care what people think, want to predict what do 

15.301/310, Managerial Psychology

These things are very different, right? 

If you ask people if it is important to save the dolphins, they say yes 

But if you walk into a supermarket, how many people buy dolphin safe tuna?  They are 

not going to pay another dollar, in order to save the dolphins 


Sometimes you will care about one, and sometimes about the other. 


Oh, btw, you remember that last time we did a bet, for 50/100 dollars?  I just want you to 

realize that this is all for real. You take bets in this class, you have to pay, and if you 

make money, you also get money, right?


(asks for the $50 from last class, student gives it to professor)  

Look, I have to keep the reputation.  This is all for real. 


So sometimes big difference between subjective and objective. 

What else are reasons one might be better than the other?


The main point is that objective in many cases is better, but there are some things we 

have no objective way to measure.   

Sometimes w/ objective scale, can measure what you did, but not why you did it 


Think about measuring come to class 

Can measure who comes to class, I can’t figure out why you came.  Can be all kinds of 

reasons, but w/o asking you, I will never know. 

Objective is better, easier measure, but can’t measure everything 


Paper on parking cars 

Another – if stand next to man when urinate, take longer or shorter to finish?

2 theories – faster because don’t want competition, get out of there.  Or longer, stress 

makes harder for them to start.  And in fact, that seems to be the result. 

Exp – had someone stand next to or not, and measured how long it took them

these are objective measures. 


We can look at Choices, payment, options, bid, where they go – all objective measures 

Statistically expensive.  Look at the case of choice. 


Objective measures 


Slide 


Limited things we can observe 


Imagine have some scale, people dist on scale 


1 case, half yes, half no 


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Recitation 6 3/1/2005 
Page 11 of 15 

2nd, one says no, not capture how vary 

Capture data across scale.  If asking about 1 number, may get something wrong 

An example: 

Try to sell MIT rings, figure out price to sell at 

Say cost $300  

Try one price out.  Say I’m a market research company, trying to make a price 

Survey, would pay 100? Everyone says yes 

So I know I can charge more than that, but I don’t know how much more.  I’m not asking  

at the right price. 

Ask around 300, much more information, people discriminate  


When ask about choice, less info than ratings  


Subjective measures intention – what would you do, what would other people do? 


Often better to ask what others would do.  Why?

Many cases only way to know what others would do is to infer from your own behavior. 

Might be easier to admit others would do it 


If I say, would you cheat in the next problem set? Unlikely to get a yes response. 

When ask, How many others likely to cheat in next problem set? Get a different answer  


Another way 

People try to think aloud.  Not very popular these days, but it’s interesting.  Train to do 

something and tell what think as they do it.  Surfing the web, what are you thinking as 

you surf the web? Verbalize it.  Oh, this looks like an interesting little gadget, and oh, this 

is a different link… 

Ton of data, hard to interpret.  But sometimes interesting 


I want to make sure you understand, and I think you do, that quantitative does not mean 

objective.  When we have these scales 1-10, it doesn’t mean they are objective scales. 


Say want to measure how much you like another class 

Can give you a subjective measure of how much you like it on a 10 pt scale. 


How can we do objective measure? Give me some examples. 

-how many problem sets turned in 

Use grade as approximation.  What else?


How can you measure objective liking? 


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Recitation 6 3/1/2005 
Page 12 of 15 

-ask if would recommend class 


Say coming up with a new product, new satellite dish 

Can ask how likely to buy it, how get objective measure? 

Want to predict if they will buy. 


-compare it to something 

Buy this vs this.  What else?

-how much talk about  

-website, how many keep coming back to check?  


Can also ask people about data 

This costs $8, would you buy it?

If you had to travel 2 hours to get this, would you do it? 

This is kind of a hybrid, right? 

Giving us in perspective if they do something, but what they give us is an objective scale. 


-another interesting scale is the 

Guttman scale 

Hasn’t been used very much, but it’s very nice. 

Imagine I want to do a Guttman scale for how studious you are. 

I try to create a set of questions where each subsequent one assumes you have done the 

previous one 


Say we had 3 behaviors  

Come to classes 

Submit all problem sets 

Study for the test. 


Ordered 


There are people who come to class 

People who submit problem sets also come to class 

Most serious people do all 3 


Subjective measurement (slide) 

Subjective measurement very popular 
Cheap 
Lots of data w/ few questions 
Tell us things we cannot observe 

Also limitations 
Problems w/ interpreting questions

If I ask you at the beginning of the semester about your tendency to study well, you will 

give me a very different answer than if I ask you in the middle of the semester. At the 

beginning of semester, you have an inability to figure out how busy you will be. 


Also have Social desirability and demand, which are objective measures though  

If  I asked how many of you cheated on the exam, you might keep that info to yourself.   

But if I ask you about cheating, it is a very different story.   


Would you like to watch The Piano or Rambo?  A lot of people would say yes, I want to 

watch The Piano, but when the day comes Rambo gets rented more frequently.    


I can frame a question to make you think I want you to answer in some way that you 

would. 


I would say, “don’t you agree that apple is a great computer?”


Each has advantages 


Beware subjective measures to predict behavior 


Fresh Samantha Paradox 

4 juices

Asked rank worst to best 


Market share 

Most highly ranked juice not purchased 

Lowest bought just as much as 2nd highest  


How could this be?


-What kind of info was taster given when making the choice? People actually tasted it? 

-ranking skewed statistics 


Suggestion correct 


3 segments people 

Each ranked diff juice 1st and all ranked orange-carrot 2nd

The second best problem 

Rankings not always translate to behavior 


Nobody ever buys 2nd best 

How solve this problem? 

Predict market share – only ask ranking for best, not whole range? 
Do we never want to know ranking? 

15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Recitation 6 3/1/2005 
Page 14 of 15 

Ranking not give much info for predicting market share, but sometimes want to know 

what is 2nd best and in particular, how far it is from 1st best 


Ratings more imp than ranking 

Ratings we actually know the difference, how much of a difference.  


Imagine you were ambassador for product B 

Prod A1, B1 (slide) 

Would you want to know if you are below the arrow or above the arrow?  Close or far?

B2, A2, may drop B2 all together if so far behind 

But B1, may be so close, want to try to compete for market share 


Ranking not give these things.  Rating might be better  

Objective measures easier to make inferences from in terms of interpreting behavior 

All kinds of things we can do that are totally objective measures.  Instead of asking if you 

like this class, can ask how many friends did you tell that you like this class. 


Hw many minutes a day spend studying?  All kinds of questions like that 


To determine if subjective or objective measures would be better, 

understand exactly what measuring 


ask ? how much prepare for case x could be other variables 


statistics is an art 

depends on data and measurements you’ve done. 

Your responsibility as a researcher, business person, someone who writes report is not 

just to present 3 bar graphs, table.  Have to truly look at the distribution, data, try to 

figure out the important aspects of this data. 


McKinsey have templates for reporting data.  Assumes all will be the same.  But it is 

absolutely not true

important to look at real data, figure out what to tell based on this data 


really your responsibility to do it well. 

no hard rules 


that’s it for today, please fill out the evaluation forms 


my old advisor used to say that these evaluation forms are taken with the seriousness they 

deserve.  We do care about this, we want feedback.
