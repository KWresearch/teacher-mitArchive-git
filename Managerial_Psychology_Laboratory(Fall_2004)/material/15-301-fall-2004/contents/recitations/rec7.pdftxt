Recitation 7 : Experimental Design 

Start day – why experimental design so important 

Imagine you work for Slimfast, trying new diet product line 

Milkshake, ice, powder, milk replace entire diet for month 


What is market share? 

You in charge – figure out what demand will be in market. How going to do it? 


-similar products 

Nothing similar 

This only where mix milk and ice, but supposed to lose 2x weight 


-hire research firm

Ok, you’re research firm now, what are you going to do?

-not know about food products 

What would you ask, how would you ask people?


How would you do it  


-ask about consumption of milk, if want to 

They say love milk, want to lose weight.  Going to buy product?

-no, but starting pt 


Give $10 ask if willing to trade for product 


Initial purchasing, not long term


-give sample 


Predict before have for market, spend money to develop 


Work marketing firm or not,   

Somebody come to you at some pt in life, say we asked people how much they would 

buy this product for, they said very likely, and for $500 


You have to think carefully about how survey was designed, what are questions, what 

does it mean, how were people interviewed, who wrote it, what was the sample 

Think all these considerations, take numbers you get, transfer to something meaningful 

Common challenge, Much like technology 


Figure out how do it, how interpret numbers 


Hope you get better idea of how to take raw numbers and how to interpret them

Today, watch a struggle to present DVD on screen☺

We might be successful  


Ad, stand in front of group of people, nothing coming 

Audience shouting “try config.sys,” etc… 

One says– get an apeoplee 


How many of you doing surveys vs experiments? 

Surveys? Experiments?

What is the difference between survey, experiment? 


-Experiment, not measuring preferences, but actions 

no 

-survey observations, experiment variables?

No, like example, experiments observe 


-experiment, actually observing? 

No, 

My advisor used to say, couldn’t be more wrong. 

I haven’t had a chance to use this in class yet, but I’m going to. 


So, the big difference 

Survey, one state one cell design, measuring only 1 thing. 


Look – how large is portion of pasta in cafeteria.  Experiment?  No, a study, measure 

only 1 thing, only 1 parameter 


In experiment, we change something. 


See if weather outside changes portion of pasta in cafeteria 

If people know cook, changes portions?


Survey -1 cell 

Experiment – multiple cells 


Reason to have multiple cells, want to manipulate cells, gives us a way to know causality 

of the effect 


Here is a study, one cell.  Read and quickly answer. (survey) 


… 

Rate Hershey’s Kiss liking 

Which animal? 

How many to trade for animal?  

…

Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 9 
Page 2 of 9 

What do you think this study is about? 
Anybody? 

-quantify preference through Hershey kisses 
Yes 
In general, is this a worthwhile study? 

Say dif is 8.  is it a worthwhile study? 

So, this is not sensible study if want estimate parameter 
What we want to see here is if 
amount of Hershey’s kisses correlated to how much one likes Hershey’s kisses? 

People who like them a lot ask for more or less in trade for the animal? 

Who thinks ask less? More? Same amount? 
Why more? 

-try to get more out of trade 

Assuming everyone likes stuffed animal better, people who like Hershey’s Kisses more 
will get more out of each one, value higher, so ask for less 

Even though single cell design, might be able to make some sense from it.  Why?  We 

had a strong theory that people who like Hershey’s kisses more will ask for less kisses 


Single cell design Useful to extent parameter interesting or have strong theory 


Strong theory, have prediction.  If doesn’t follow, disprove theory. 


Most useful about Experiment – show causality.  The question is how to design them 

Hard to say 


What is an elegant experiment? 
When see it, know it’s elegant 
Like a picture, you look and say, I like that.  Very hard up front to say what to do to make 
it beautiful 

In general good experiment controls for everything else, only change the one thing you 
are interested in. rest about aesthetic value 

Example from book of Judges, chapter 6 “the first experiment”  (slide) 

Gideon wakes up, hears God telling him to save Israel 

15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 9 
Page 3 of 9 

He says, this sounds like a dangerous task, it’s not every dream that I have that I follow it 
right away 
Be a bit More cautious, let’s do the experiment. 
God, prove to me that this is the case.   
He is Designing first condition of experiment 
Puts wool on floor.  Says, if wool wet and rest dry, we are getting somewhere 
Got up next day, Experiment worked – was he happy?  Not yet 
Why? He has not tried this before, maybe it always turns out that only the wool will be 
wet with dew.  He was quite sophisticated experimentally. 

Ok, let’s do opposite condition, that would be the most discriminating, wool dry, rest wet 
with dew 

Now Gideon happy 
Controlled, did condition, opposite condition, worked out 
Now I know something else must be causing this 
2 conditions, 2 cells 
This is Example for a good exp 

Many times, want do multiple exp 
Series of exp – try get logic across to figure out pt 
No experiment can be perfect 
Build case through multiple attempts 

Single cell designs 

So we said single cell designs not experiments, but studies 
Can set parameters, test theories  

Think about way single cell design, measuring one thing, but can say something 

Example: I first came to MIT, following experiment - 
Went to Chapel Hill where I studied psychology 
Brewery, let us be waiters for 1 week 
We were tasting waiters 
Beers to taste, described, what would you like to try? 
Table by table 
Some gave menus, told to mark 
Brought beer, ask how much like beer and if they regret making that choice 

Wanted to look at if when people make decisions one after other, if influenced by the 
other people 

More or less like other people?

Seeking variety or seeking conformity?

How many people think conformity? variety?


variety 

Same experiment in Hong Kong – conformity 


That’s not the ptoin, it’s if people before you can change what beer you get, and you 

might not like it very much 


Here’s what happened 

People who ordered out loud less happy 

Why?  If you ordered Summer Wheat, and I don’t order Summer Wheat because of that, I  

order something I like less, I just took a hit on my preferences 

Wasn’t true 1st person

st person ordered happiest 

1

2 conditions  


Also ask another ?

People who ordered regularly – too much or too little variety? 

What’s the standard? 


Created Simulation 

Took all people’s data, assigned to random tables, what would be average variety? 

Compare to actual variety in table 


Think about it in a way, Take experiment, create some standard 


Turns out, people had too much variety 


Paper on my web site 

Example of take single cell and create some rational standard 


Random Assignment 

One of the most important things.  Talked about it 1st week w/ causality, correlation 

Experiment, people doing 1 or 2 things 
Want to be sure 2 groups differ only on manipulation 

Say sing for 5 min or poetry 5 min, then ask about careers 
See if singing out loud changes what we think about possible careers 

If don’t have random assign, instead let them choose, cannot attribute effect on career 
choice to anything about the act of singing 
Might be self selection 

15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 9 
Page 5 of 9 

Random assignment very important 

Make sure groups same on everything else 

Most importantly, because of that, direction for causation 

Everything same, controlled, thing different caused by manipulation 


Now, do experiment 

Will be a great experiment 

Fast, pay attention 

Face you prefer – 5s look, 2s choose 

Mark on paper, series of options 

… 


Ok, what did you notice happened here?


-faces recycled 

-same comparison made 

No, not same, but against others 

Why did that?


-if prefer somebody, see if prefer over third 


What we are looking at is called transitivity 

When prefer a to b, b to c, but c to a 

In general when prefer a to b, b to c, also have to prefer a to c 

Wanted to see if people violate transitivity 

If violate, means preferences are very hard to come by 

We asked people to answer 1 of 2 ?s

Who do you like more, or who is happier 


What we want to look at, is 

What is easier, what do people make less mistakes in?

Like more, or who is happier?

If one more collective transitivity in one than other, can say which is more difficult 

Consult own preferences, or look in external world?


One factor design – manipulate only 1 thing 

Have level one, level 2, effective measure.  Could be more levels, but one factor 

Could be, see if people violate transitivity more levels than 2, but one factor 


-I don’t know  

Wearing hat backward 

Could ask if people smile at you more w/ hat backward or forward.  One factor design. 

Why?  Manipulate one thing. Backward vs forward 


-3 types testimonials, neutral, positive, balance 


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 9 
Page 6 of 9 

Think about ad for presidential election, negative and positive ads.  Could look at which  

is more effective 


Could say, what motivates students to study, possibility of A or fear of F? 


Manipulate 1 thing, considered 1 factor, any number levels 

Students study, can have parents call, peer pressure, fear of failing, all kinds of things 


Can test all things to affect 1 thing – one factor designs 

A lot of manipulators, but one factor design 


In contrast, multiple factor design 

Take hat example, factor 1 wear hat fwd or bkwd.  Factor 2 - we have the hat be Red Sox 

or Yankees 


Full factorial design 


Motivate students do well by frightening or encouraging,  

Add something else to it 

Classical music or war marches 


When cross all levels, multi cell, 

Multi factor design 


Single fact des not capturing complexity of real life 


Studying not only driven by grades, but social pressure 


Could say Fear vs hope and Parents call y/n 


Think 2 things could work together 

Parents call and fear worst performance?


Want multiple   


Story: 

PhD joint computer, psychology, in same lab.  My professor comes in with wife 

Ask beer, hello Dan, how are you, graduate? Yes.  

Something wrong, right?  This guy graduated w/ PhD, only get job serving beer? 

Had to write him afterwards, explain  


Say did something, high energy, low energy music 

Theory, low energy better performance  

Gender 2 more than gender 1 

2 effects, both work, work independently 

Could test separately 


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 9 
Page 7 of 9 

Ordinal interaction – both increase, but more for 1 gender 

Not just additive 

Small difference in low energy, but big w/ high energy 

Woman and high energy,  


Also have disordinal – one effect one way, other effect other way 

Men positively affected by music, women negatively 


Difference for how interpret results  


All these interactions is the reason we do multi factorial designs 


Interested to find out why we have reactions so much?

Not only tell us effect works, but also when effect doesn’t work  

Usually feel we understand something better when we know when it works and we know  

when it doesn’t work 


Example, motivate people to come to class, all kinds of things we can do 

What could I do to have no effect? 

Have effect working and have it not working 


Another topic 

within vs between subject designs 


within – subject or subjects in multiple conditions

experiment we did, between subject design - some asked about liking, some asking happy 


could have been within subject design, 15 pairs happier, 15 who like more 

-within design, becomes apparent to subject what experiment is about 
Disadvantage, what is the advantage? 

-lot of variables get automatic controls 
All kinds of variances, all have preferencess for like and not like 

Could Run experiment, give shock, erase memory, try again – not very common 

These are advantages and disadvantages, there is not one that is better 
Experimental design is the design of structure of the experiment 
What cells we have, what factors, what are we measuring? 

Started in agriculture, figure out what gave more yield 

15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 9 
Page 8 of 9 

Fields of wheat – had to fig out what worked 
Fertilizer, no fertilizer, sun, no sun 
Divide field into small parts, cells, try different things 

Reason for cells in design 
Figure out which one worked, how they worked 

Summarize, then show you a great movie 
Experimental design is about laying groundwork, rules for how exp will work 
Think about single factor/ multiple factor 
All interactions?  All cells? 

Next week 
Will talk hypothesis testing 
Do experiment, one of cells different 
Nothing would come up exactly same twice 

Statistically significant – how decide when something is significantly different?
