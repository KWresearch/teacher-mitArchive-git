Why test for differences?

If we ﬁnd that females are rated as 8 on being
nice and males are rated as 7 -- are they
different?
After all different things are different !
Why test these differences?

Why test for differences?

Two main reasons:
Variance (measurement error, random error,
other variables)
Making inferences beyond the sample to the
population at large

Variance
We are living in a stochastic world

Hypotheses testing I

How can we test that things are different?
Set 2 hypotheses that cover the entire possible
range of outcomes
H0 & H1
H0- No difference  Group 1 [=, , ] Group 2
H1-Difference  Group 1 [, >, <] Group 2

Examples

Hypotheses testing Ib

H0 & H1-- Examples:
Is a coin fair
Gender and grades
Healing with a new medication
Ability to cheat
Marriage over time

For each please write H0 & H1

Hypothesis testing II

Why test a hypothesis we don’t believe in?
We do this because we can only show that
something is wrong -- not that something is
right
What does it mean to reject H0?
If H0 is correct, the probability of getting this
result (or a more extreme result) is very low --
thus we reject H0 and (for now) accept H1

2 types of errors

Not conservative and liberal just balancing 2

Type I error Reject H0

Type 2 error

The meaning of p

What does p means?
What is the difference between 
 p = 0.03, p = 0.001, & p = 0.11
What is the relationship between p and conﬁdence?
What is the relationship between p and effect size?
What is the relationship between p and number of
subjects?

The importance of effect size

Always give effect size measures
Mean difference
Quartile differences
etc.

Summary

Hypotheses testing
H1 & H0 -- setting the hypothesis to
something you don’t believe in

Example 1

Who eats more lollipops males of females?
7 females; 5 males followed for a month
Females:  = 27, 2 = 29.2
Males:  = 19, 2 = 24.57

Is there a difference?

Calculating ...

t = (27 - 19) - (0)
5 x 24.57 + 7 x 29.2 ( 5 x  7 )

5 +  7
5 + 7 -2

Example 2

Does the sun creates freckles?
Each subject has one side of their body in the
sun and one in the shade

H0 sun side  non-sun side
H1 sun side > non-sun side

 t test summary

t test as an example of
inferential statistics
Mean differences relative to
variance

ANOVA

ANOVA I

Analysis of variance

This is the same logic of the t test but
allowing for more tests

So why not just do multiple t tests?

1 - doing many tests can cause errors

2 - there is beneﬁt in pooling observations
across cells

ANOVA II

The story is the same ...

Looking at the variance within cells
relative to the variance across cells (as if
there were no treatments) and asking how
much does the distinction between cells
helps reduce the variance

The general formula

SS = Sum of squares

SS total = SS within + SS between

SSt=SSw+SSb

This means:

Take each of the samples, subtract it from
the appropriate mean, and square it

Sum of squares

Once we have the sum of squares we
compare the SSb and SSw
As the SSb relative to SSw gets larger the
results are more likely to be signiﬁcant

Degrees of freedom

This is a base to think about the amount
of independent observations we have, and
thus the strength of the results
In general we lose a degree of freedom
when we use a mean...

The formula

F = SSb / dfb
SSw / dfw

=

SSb / K-1
SSw / n-k

Once you have the F value use the F table
with the correct df

Summary I

Hypothesis testing
Because we can never prove anything
and only disprove things we set a
hypothesis (H0) as one we do not
believe in.
Once we reject H0 we are willing to
accept H1

Summary II

T test and ANOVA
It is all about variance and mean
differences
How large is the mean difference
relative to the variance!
These tests give us the probability of
the data given that H0 is correct
