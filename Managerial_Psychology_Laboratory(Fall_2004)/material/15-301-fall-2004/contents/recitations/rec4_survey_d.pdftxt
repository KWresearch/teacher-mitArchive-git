Recitation 4: Survey Design 

(a dash “-“ indicates student responses) 

Survey Design and taking measurements 

I hope you have prepared for class today. 

Do you wake up thinking about measurement in surveys? Does it not make you jump out 

bed?


Today, we will write survey questions. Sit next to someone. 

Can how a question is phrased influence the response?


How could we influence the prediction - if bush or Kerry will be elected? 


Don’t sit in the last 4 rows, as we agreed 

Here is what I want you to do: 


Make up a survey question to ask anything you want to know about MIT students.  Do 

not use a y/n format.  Write down your question and the response scale. 


Only limit: not y/n 


(waits a couple of minutes.) 


What is your question and the response scale?


-Do you feel you are able to balance your academic and social life?

-Strongly disagree Disagree Neutral Agree Strongly agree 


Turn to your neighbor and present your questions to each other.  Tell them why you 

chose your question and your response scale 


(late person walks in) 

We were just discussing things that embarrass us, it is your turn… 


Lecture 

3 steps to answer survey Questions: 

Interpret the question 

Retrieve info and form judgment 

Map judgment onto response scale 


File Drawer view: 

Attitudes are stable dispositions stored in long term memory, and you retrieve them


Constructive view: 
have to create info 
attitudes are constructed on the fly and computed when necessary from whatever 
information comes to mind 

Interpretation 

What brand of soft drink do you usually buy?

A simple question to interpret, no? 


All of your life? Summer and winter? Recently?  

You?

Friends you buy for?

Diet Coke and Coke the same brand? 


Can be interpreted in many ways. 


Different people think differently about the question = variance 


Questions about action are the most open to interpretation 


Retrieve 

How many ounces of alcohol did you consume last year? 


hard to answer, not accurate 


What would be a better question to ask?


Mapping 

How successful in life are you 1-10?  What is 10?  Is 10 the valedictorian? 

-Compare to bill gates 
-happy self is 10 
-it is where you set your expectations for yourself 
-top 10% of population would be a 10 

This is a very tricky topic 

To design a good question, you must be certain people can: 

1. Interpret the question in the way you want them to 
2. Access the relevant information

Lecture 3

How much wind have you experienced in the past week?  Not a reasonable question, you 
won’t remember. 

3. Map their response onto the scale in a meaningful and consistent way within a person 
and across people 

Scale formats 

How about this (slide) 

How successful have you been in life?

0 to 10 

-5 to 5 


-nobody wants to be negative 


Negative 5 implies failure

How about 0? Should we have a 1 to 11 scale? 


The response scale provides cues for the “normal” levels of behavior. 


TV (slide) 

How many hours a day do you spend watching TV?

Real data, 2 response scales 


Difference – almost double in the >2.5 category  


If you take a bathroom break in the middle, do you subtract that time? 

If you eat while you are watching TV, does that count too? 


The scheme is very simple, but not consistent  

Why the difference? 


-search to classify activities as tv 


Use scale to establish a range 

If I think I am slightly above average, I might choose the second category 


Example: 


Psychologists were given a description of a mental patient and asked the likelihood that 

the mental patient would commit a crime again? They were given a scale of 1%-9% or 

9%-100% 

Both groups answered in the middle of the range. 

These were professional psychologists!

Floss (slide)  

How many times in a day, 1-10?

How many times in a year, 1-10?


How likely are you to develop gum disease? 

How much would you pay for a bottle of scope mouthwash? 


If you answer on the left end of the scale, do you feel you need to go to the dentist?

Does the top or bottom scale affect your answer? 


-top scale 10x a day not reasonable, ridiculous 


But the general effect is true for the scales 


Schwartz example: 

Same scale, but question: how often do you masturbate? 

Then asked, how happy is your love life?


To change your own interpretation of your love life is profound.  You should be familiar 

with your own love life.  


They replicated the experiment in Germany, where there are less strict guidelines 

The surveyor offered her phone # if asked - those who answered that they were unhappy 

with their love lives asked for the number. 


Reading into it, construct #s 

Imagine questions that, after answering them, you are more pro Bush or pro Kerry 

Surveys can create preferences, not just learn them  


Actual Bush supporter Question: 

How would you feel if you learned that McCain had a child by a black prostitute?

It was not true, but later a paper showed him with his adopted black child, and people 

took it as evidence that it was true. 


Effects of scales (slide) 

In many cases, it makes people reinterpret their own behavior 


Importance of context (slide) 

1. If jaywalk, rate how bad 
2. If kill Professor, rate how bad 

What do you think would happen to question 2? 

-compare to question 1 badness 

What is very bad is already determined by the first one.

Scale not only based on the question’s scale, but also previous questions 


S.O.’s (slide)

List 10 reasons you love X  

Or List 3 reasons you love X  


Is there a difference? 


-condition 1 higher, more reasons 

-condition 2 higher, can’t think of enough to fill list 


For most 10 is hard, people run out  

Follow up: how much do you love your S.O.?

Condition 1 gave lower answers. 


The process implies you should be able to come up with 10 reasons 


Say I wanted a higher evaluation at the end of semester.  What could I ask to change the 

class rating? 


-list 3 reasons you love this class 

-compare to a class you know they hate 

-list 10 reasons you don’t like this class, and they will run out 


As you can see, there are a lot of possibilities for application   


Another – if want people to buy BMWs 


Question 1 or2?

Vote. 


2 is the answer 


Constructive view of preferences 

Many examples suggest people don’t know their preferences 

Only when you ask does it materialize. 


If you ask, they give an opinion – if you stop to ask for directions, people will give 

directions, sometimes even if they don’t know them.  

Sometimes people learn about themselves from their own answer 


Question Order 

(Slide)


People think question 2 is correlated with the weather. Why? 


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 3 
Page 5 of 7 

-think weather, then answer 
-life more positive if bad weather 

Q1 actually correlated. 
Interpretation of the question based on what they think you are asking 
People think you would not be asking the same question a second time, that you are 
asking for new information 

Question Order II (slide) 

1st correlated, 2nd uncorrelated 

Response language 

People think in terms of discussion  


Where are you from? 


-Virginia 


How is it there, scale of 1-10? 


If I say 1st, “summer is coming,” you assume I want to visit 


Extracting sensitive information 

The more people feel they cannot trust a situation, the less likely they will give sensitive 
information. 

Money experiment in hallway at MIT - free money: $1, or $5, or $10, or $50 
The bigger the amount, the more suspicious it is, and fewer people go for it. 
How can we overcome this? 

Have you done x? … (slide) 
I don’t mean ecstasy ☺ 

Extracting sensitive Information I 

2 made it acceptable  


3 reporting other people is easier. If the answer is yes, it is easier for you to admit. 


Lots of people are sensitive, embarrassed, don’t want admit things 


Extracting information II 

15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 3 
Page 6 of 7 

Why is this interesting? 


-could lie 

-obligated to answer truthfully? 


Embarrassed to admit I did x 

But you don’t know what question I answered, who I was. 

Yes to 1 or 2?

Anonymous. 

Coin flip: Heads, answer y, tails answer truth. 

This protects the individual response, but gets the general population answer by 

extracting the information statistically. 

This way helps people hide, but the population level response is intact 

We can backtrack the answer 


Most information we ask for is sensitive 

So we use workarounds 


(Passes out survey), 

Please look and answer as quickly as you can. 


Fresh Samantha paradox 


Read the readings, know them well  


Types of measurement will be on the exam. 


next wednesday will be a recitation.
