Recitation 9: Writing and Presenting 

Remember Pavlov’s dog, who learned to salivate to a bell by associating the bell with 

food?

Conditioning – some properties of one thing stick to the other 


Today, we pair writing skills with free food 

Hopefully over time this will make you feel writing is a better thing to do. 


This will be an interactive class, exercises 


Guest Speaker: Mary Caulfield 


Luann comic, very helpful background 

Writing and presenting 


Exercises so you understand what we are getting at when we write mean stuff on papers. 

The important part in writing and presenting is visualizing your audience 

Not just filling pages 


Resist the temptation to copy a formula without understanding it 


You are not majors in managerial psychology 

It is tempting to look at a text and copy the way they write 


But you have to understand or you will get in trouble 

Controlled prose – understanding what words mean, not what you think they mean or 

what they sound like. 


The final thing - the link between writing and presenting 

Comic: teacher reacting - Silence for two frames, a very long silence 

Be able to talk about your subject in front of an audience 


Be confident in the words you use, shared vocabulary 

$10 phrases get you in trouble 


There is a point where you’ve got to commit 

Here’s what I did and saw in the experiment 

Cut through hopes, assert something 

Tell us what it meant, what you got out of it 

Challenging time 


Look at final draft as if writing 1st time 

Like new piece of writing 


Not because you are bad writers, but it is a common part of the process 


You thought it was great, get it back, are devastated 

Get back to work, you often throw out what’s written, rethink, 

Treat as people do in the workplace 

Visualize TA, professor, others as audience, as if we pay you to do this 


Do not use every paragraph from the 1st draft 

Still gathering data, exploring thoughts and not know what data meant yet 


decide what’s important 


Data can say more than before, see all data together

Establish relationships, transition between ideas 

questions you want to ask 


Emphasis changed 

Significant still significant? 


Thesis more focused?

Looking at smaller population? 

Smaller questions? 


Central argument based on questions you were asking, answers from data. 


Headings, subheadings 

Make sense?

Now is the time to revise


Activity: 

Dividing you into 3 groups 

How many brought writing? 


Form groups, 2 people with writing - partners.  Others, join writing pair


Instructions: 


People with writing, read each other’s writing 

Before you start, here is structure (slide) 


Read 

Summarize what said in couple paragraphs 

Name a couple things the writer has done well 

This is same with performance reviews in the business world

Important terms, ideas – stuff writer said more than once 
Don’t edit, just point out where you had to re-read 
Make suggestions 
Be observers, give feedback. 

3 min for reading, stop, then start discussion, for 5 min 
TAs keep conversation going, on task 
Start reading now. 
… 
Another minute, but start to think about how you will summarize what you read 

Ok, in pairs or groups, verbalize to partner summary of what read 
Finish up and switch to other partner 

Move on to 2nd bullet point, what writer has done well - do that fairly quickly 

Terms and ideas, don’t have to go one by one, jump in, also can say where to read twice.  
Middle, qualitative bullets 

Now each come up with 3 suggestions for improvement 
Concrete, very explicit, what suggesting and how they should do it. 2 minutes 
Half a minute left 
I will ask you if willing to share 1 or two suggestions 
-more time? 
Finish up after class, need to make more points 

Open up discussion 
-footnotes less obtrusive, endnotes or something 
Was this helpful feedback?  
-yes 
felt repetitive even if you say new things, words repetitive 

Other thing to bear in mind 
Person reading may not be right 
Do not correct grammar, pass wisdom 

This process - see work through eyes of reader 
See what peers struggle with, have questions about, helpful even if don’t take suggestions 
verbatim 
Process - get you to write, see again 

abstract written last 
read and should make sense separate from rest of paper 
write the rest as if abstract did not exist 
not refer in abstract to anything written in rest of paper 
decide if paper has relevant data 

15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Recitation 9 
Page 3 of 6 

abstract available separate from paper 
generally 75-150 words 
there are descriptive and informative abstracts 
some are both 
“this paper contains,” or freestanding 
st sentence, explicitly state what problem was and what happened 
1
Plainly, simply as possible 

Reader: do I want to read this? 
Abstract very difficult to write 
Introduction, conclusion should make some sense on own 
Bear in mind, people read sections out of order 
Conclusion first, etc 
Should make sense on its own 
Tone helpful, not condescending 
Doing something based on data, fairly complex 

Same exercise on key sections and paragraphs 
Into final draft, identify most important paragraphs 
Intro, conclusion most important 
Define terms that seem obvious to you 
forbidden to use the word “simply” 
Readers don’t know definitions, why you chose them 
Entitled to courteous explanation 

every paragraph says something, carry paper forward 
leave in only those that add information, say something 
In service of presenting data, contribute to argument 

Read grammar handout about who’s kicking whom 
What does abstract concept do? 

Issue of repetition tricky 
Use, add meaning 

Examples - Read out loud 

Manner of reading correspond to manner of writing 
Readily find actor in the 1st sentence?  Took a minute to find. 

Read 2 sentences out loud 

Sentence becomes shorter, easier to follow if converted to verbs.  Know who’s kicking 
who 

Take 5-10 min for pizza, talk about final things while eating.

Combine cranky slide with pizza 

Can’t emphasize just how important re-reading of paper will be 

Need to be comfortable reading paper several times 

Hard to find typos in own work, but can find some 

I am frantic when I see errors I know spell check would catch 
Those are the things you really need to correct 
Peer review, look for obvious typos 

Common mistake 
Its is possessive pronoun, no apostrophe 
It’s = it is 

Very silly mistake, don’t make it 

Don’t “this.” 

Make sure we know what ‘this’ refers to  
Know what ‘this’ is, what ‘this’ refers to 
To overdo is better 

Help you think about paper, see writing again 
Like you would hand in to boss, committee for money 
You should be proud of it 
Presented in neat manner 
Anything keeps all together, but neat 

Treat as if money depended on it, because ultimately money will depend on it 

We read a lot of papers 
Everyone you hand you document to does a lot of reading 
Trying to do best we can for you, so make it easy for us 
Is a draft ever final? No. 
Time limited, other things to do 
Might expand later 
For this draft, proofread 
When in doubt, document your source 
Number pages, figures numbered 
Check numbering of figures.  It is easy to get them out of order, use the wrong number 

Right now

Take out paper, pencil, or blank document 

Take 2 min to answer these questions: 


In-class self evaluation (slide)

What did you accomplish, what did you do?

What did the experiment do, find out? 

How can you improve over first draft, more definitive discussion of own work? 

Comments from reviewers - include/ not include? 

To not use is okay, but think about why. 


In terms of study, writing, what would you do if you had more time?


Use freewrite style 

If can’t think of answer, just keep writing 

You can repeat yourself, just keep writing  

Defined amount of time 


If you get stuck, stop and do this more times 

Think about process, realize why things aren’t gelling 


Presentations in general 


Important to remember 

I relied on Powerpoint, but tried not to rely too heavily 

Broke it up, speaking directly to you 

Slides are an audio visual aid 

You are the most important part of the presentation 

People make elaborate Powerpoint slides and forget to respond to the audience 


Makes you more nervous to have lots of slides 

Hiding behind Powerpoint makes your job more difficult 

Underline key points by interacting with the audience 

Talk off of the slide, don’t it set up as if it is the whole talk 


Rules across slides: 


Decide what’s important.  What are you saying?  What’s the most important thing you 

are saying? 


Re-read Darryl Bem article  

What concepts are you presenting? Still relevant and line up with what you found? 

Think about the audience 

If not writing to the audience, you are writing to yourself and the audience gets resentful 


Feedback is an important element of communicating in the workplace.
