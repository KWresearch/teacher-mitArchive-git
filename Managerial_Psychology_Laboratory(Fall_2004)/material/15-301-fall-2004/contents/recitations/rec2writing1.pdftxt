Recitation 2: Writing as Thinking 

Okay, good morning everyone.  Didn’t we say the last four rows are prohibited? 

Welcome to another… exciting day… 


Mary will enlighten us about writing today.  


Before we move onto that - everyone has submitted the 1 page proposal. 

If you don’t have feedback yet, you will get it today 

Your ideas will have to be consolidated 


After you submit 4 page proposal, there is no turning back. 

Finally: CUHS committee on the Use of Human Subjects proposal. 

Our CUHS is fantastic.  Great at MIT 
We will send guidelines tonight of how to write CUHS Proposal. 

Speaker: Mary E. Caulfield, Technical Instructor, Writing Across the Curriculum 

Does anyone feel confident in writing their proposal? 

Raise your hand if when you are writing in the sciences, you are writing for experts? 

How many think if you write for non-experts, you are dumbing down your writing? (a  

few hands) 

How many think that when you are talking about a concept, you should generate lots of  

synonyms so you can restate your concept many times? 


I do want you to keep your own answers/preconceptions in mind 


Writing the Empirical Journal Article by Daryl J. Bem  

Don’t skip reading this article, it can save you a lot of time.  When you turn in your 4 

page proposal, 3 of us will read your paper.  If you read this article, you will avoid being 

shocked when you get your proposal back.  We are going to have comments for people, 

don’t see that as a failure.  We are trying to save you agony in the future.  The purpose of 

giving us this 4 page article to give you ways to think about your concepts, phrase your 

concepts to write more clearly. 


Writing as thinking 


Putting your ideas on paper is a difficult transition.  If the proposal is not everything you 

want it to be, don’t worry about 


Writing and thinking are interchangeable. 


Write the article that makes sense to your results.  There is a lot of planning now, but at 
the end you will have to look closely at the results you get. 

Think as a process.  You are going to be doing interim writing, not to show anyone, but 
to process your results 

If you can educate your reader, that is a success.  It is not a failure when things don’t turn 
out how you expect them to be 

Introduction – gives context 
Becomes more specific 
Introduces the study 
Discuss your results – relate to world at large, give context 
Conclusions 

Craft of Research (book) 

Start one thing, introduce tension with new info, then a new thing evolves 

Introduction – establish context 
New information discovered  

“Since the dawn of time, parallel processing has been an important concept” 
-too general 

Methods – What it’s like to be a participant in the study. 

Be explicit when discussing the facts – don’t speak too much in abstract terms 

We will want to see the 4 page proposal, the 1st draft, and the final draft all together at the 
end. 

Finding a Topic: Notes from The Craft of Research – Daryl Bem 
Research = Problems to be solved (all initial observation, can be proved? Verifiable?) 
Lots of raw data, but important to think about context of report.  New perspective?  Facts 
are helpful only in context 
Provide new perspective (the dreaded “so what”) 

Why do we write?  To remember, Understand, Gain perspective 

Test your ideas against other perspectives 
Anticipate audience’s questions. 

Writing instructors – detectors of unclarity 
“as unclarity detectors, readers are never wrong” –Daryl Bem

Target audience may ask questions that you think are dumb, but there are times you have 

to clarify what seems to be obvious.  You may be making assumptions that the audience 

has not yet made, or using different vocabulary, or the audience wants to know that you  

have done due diligence.  Writing in several drafts will help you do this.  Can’t do this 

midnight-6am on the day it is due 


Research may extend beyond the semester.  Primary audience: TA, immediate supervisor, 

research supervisor.  Be aware of possible secondary audience: students, co-workers, 

others that do similar work.   

Define terms, use clear wording, state your assumptions in your work  


Regardless of how much you prepared, there will be things you do not anticipate.  Keep  

writing about your topic. 


Take notes 

Outlines 

Diagrams

Write bad drafts 

“horrible drafts” 


Break the process into manageable parts. 


Getting ready to write: 

Find a specific/manageable topic 

Generate questions, find some that intrigue you – a good way to anticipate audience 

Determine evidence readers expect 

Research Sources? Available? 


Your topic will evolve 

Your argument will take shape gradually 

Some research sources will prove more useful than others. 


Academic writing does not have to be abstract. 


Look at Daryl Bem article! 


The more reading you do for models in this field, the more you see what we are looking 

for.  


Give your project a working title 

Focus on the “how” and “why” questions 

Use unknown areas to construct a “to do” list 


Think about what you don’t know yet 

List the things you don’t know yet

Set some tasks to give you information to do the things you need to do. 

Translate writing into outline 

Have it somewhere where it can be changed, altered, modified 

Outline the small steps 

Topics and subtopics 

Articles you have found and would like to read 

Complete the tasks as you are able to (not necessarily in list order) 


Time Management 

Try to write every day (or regular times) 

Don’t judge your writing – be curious instead 

Pace yourself and allow time for real life 


Moving from hard science to social sciences – switching disciplines, languages  

Consulting to software to academics – all different 


Don’t judge your writing 

Don’t set unrealistic goals – all nighter won’t work 

Few pages per day, let that mount up 


Other class – New Yorker cartoons 

Boy with sled, but just starting to snow.  Mom:  don’t worry, it will accumulate 


Don’t neglect reading time 


How to Keep Going  

Find articles and read them – how to emulate, what is good about that 


-How do we find articles to look at? 

Anything that interests you is a good place to start, look at sources 


Ariely: I’m a big fan of my own writing.  I will post a couple of articles for an example 


Technical/Grammatical Tasks 


Last, as it should be 

Keep underlining most important sentences 

Ask if they communicate your point effectively 

Look at a couple sentences 

Don’t try to make every sentence, every draft perfect.  Make sure you have 2-3 sentences 

that really “punch those things forward” 


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Recitation 2 
Page 4 of 6 

Write a sentence that encapsulates your goal, post it on a sticky note 

Make sure quotes, etc, include full citation while you are doing research. 

There will be a last minute adrenaline rush when you get down to it 

That’s when plagiarism happens.  We’re not bad, we just don’t have it, no one will notice 

right?  We will notice, we read enough that we can tell the difference between something 

published and student writing 


Look at verbs in your writing 

Avoid repeating things “each and every” 

“pink in color”  “many in number”   

Make things more simple  


Great example, passage reduced by half. 


p. 12 of article – 2 inches went down to 1 inch without losing information 

How many people feel you have to dumb down your writing to write for people? 
-a couple of people 

Get rid of “meta-language” to make writing clearer 

When you get back your 4 page papers, you will probably see we crossed out a lot.  Pay 
attention to what we crossed out.  You can live a full and happy life without using extra 
verbs 

Passive voice – see what you can put into active voice 
Shorter, more precise, more lively 

Fix writing mistakes – make good research better, make your writing clearer 

Conclusion – write early, write often 
Keep asking yourself how to make it better 

Get people to critique your work.  Pay attention to what they point out.  You don’t have 
to follow suggestions, but look at what is unclear. 

Make sure your project has a title – specific and as close to your research as you can 
There are plenty of unanswerable questions – ask something you can answer this term. 
Ask yourself “who cares” 

Plan as concretely as you can

Be explicit about any assumptions you have 

Results 

4 page maximum.  If you can do less, that’s okay, but make sure you have enough 
information.  Don’t use smaller than 12pt font, should be double spaced. 

Ariely 

Why is it not a good experiment to see who came today and see if you do better on the 
proposal grade? 
-introducing choice 
How could we do it instead? 
-tell everyone to come, separate into writing lecture/ Ariely lecture groups 
-tell some people not to come to lecture 
Good . 

If you want my help tonight, send email before nine.   

We are passing out a survey, answer 1 question at a time, don’t look ahead.
