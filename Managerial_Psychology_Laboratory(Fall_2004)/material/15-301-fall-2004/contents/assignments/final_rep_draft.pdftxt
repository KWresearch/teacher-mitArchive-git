Draft of Final Report

Due Date: October 25th, 2004 (Monday)

The Task 
Prepare a draft of the final report  on your  individual research project without the results (unless you’ve 
already collected data), saying how you would interpret  your  results if they turn out  to be as you 
expected, and what you would conclude if they don’t match your  hypothesis. 

General Structure
You can structure your  paper in what ever way seems most  appropriate, but you should aim to  include 
the following: 
(cid:120)(cid:3) The title of the pro ject
(cid:120)(cid:3) Your name
(cid:120)(cid:3) Abstract
(cid:120)(cid:3)
Introduction (i.e. your  research question, motivation)
(cid:120)(cid:3) Literature Review (i.e. discuss findings from prior research related to your  research question, 
highlight how they are related to your  study and what original contribution you might be able to 
make)
(cid:120)(cid:3) Research Design
- Participants
- Method/Procedure
- Independent/Dependent Measures
- Expected results (or actual results if you’ve already collected data)
- Discussion (i.e. interpretation of the expected results or failure to obtain these results)
(cid:120)(cid:3) Conclusion
- Summary of results
- Interpretation of the results in terms of your  introduction
- Limitations of your  study
- Suggest ions for  further research

Length
There are no fixed requirements on the length of this draft, but try to target something around 15 pages 
(Times New Roman 12pt  font, double-spaced) for  the final pro ject. 

References for your Literature Review
Literature reviews are important because they help you frame you research questions, and think of the 
implications of your  findings (plus, it will be part of your  final grade). 

Besides the Internet and Dewey Library, MIT  does have subscriptions to many online journals. The 
following are example of some e-journals that you might find helpful:
1. http://www.jstor.org/
Collection of journals in different disciplines. Look under "Business" to find the management-
oriented journals. You can read and download entire papers at  this website.

only have access to  the abstracts but not the actual papers.
