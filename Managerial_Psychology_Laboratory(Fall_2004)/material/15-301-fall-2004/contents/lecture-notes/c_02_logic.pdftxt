Agenda for today

Go over the homework problems that
were due today

Intuitive inference of data &
information

What makes a good project

Example -- study from last week

Some ﬁnal questions

Critical thinking

 Critical thinking

• Observing and recording data is the
central aspect of social science
• Sometimes, the data at hand is not ideal!
• The question we will start addressing
today is what can we learn from different
types of data.

Questions

• Please provide an answer to each of the
following questions.

•
• For each, indicate:
• what you believe in
• and why.

Q1: Cholesterol & hear t diseases

• A large study in Framingham found that people
with high cholesterol levels are much more likely
to have heart attacks
• It was also found that diets and medication can
reduce cholesterol
• Physicians recommendations for diets and
medications reduced heart attacks only by a small
number and did not reduce mortality!
• What is going on?

Q2: Uri Geller

• In one TV show Uri Geller told the viewers
that he will activate broken clocks in their
homes.
• After Geller concentrated, many people
called in to report that their clocks started
working
• Does this means that Uri Geller had such
powers?  How would you test it?

Q3: Reward and punishment

• It has been well documented that
rewarding good behavior is more effective
than punishing bad behavior.
• It was also observed that in ﬂight school
complementing excellent performance is
usually followed by bad performance, while
criticizing bad performance is usually
followed by better performance.
• What is going on?

Q4: The “hot hand”

• Many people believe that athletes (such as
basketball players) can be in a “hot” state
(for example have a “hot hand”), such that
they are more likely to score after they
have just scored
• The hot hand can have many reasons
• Such as ….
• But, is it real?

Q5: Discrimination?

• UC Berkeley in the fall of 1973
• 8,442 men and 4,321 women applied
• 44% of the men and 35% of the women
were admitted
• The quality of the applicants was the
same
• Is this discrimination?

Q6: Stock predictions

• One stock broker provides monthly
predictions that correctly predicted 7 of the
9 downturns in the economy over the past
3 years
• Is he an expert? 
• Do you want to invest with this person?

Q7: Medical diagnosis

• Imagine that a blood test identiﬁed a
person with a rare disease (base rate of
0.1% in the population).
• This test identiﬁes as a positive result
98% of the people who have the disease
but also 4% of the healthy population.
• Given this performance, how likely is it that
the person who was identify as have the
disease, indeed has it?

Q8: “The bible code”

• It turn out that if you start from the last
letter of the ﬁrst word in the bible and
count every 50th letter, you get the word
“TURA” -- which means bible in Hebrew
• There are many such examples of hidden
meanings in the bible and this has been
suggested as evidence that the bible was
not written by men.
• What do you think?

Evidence….

• We encounter evidence like those
presented here every day.
• We make inferences based on such data
and sometimes even make
recommendations.
• We should try to think critically about data,
whether it is research, our research, or
just the news.

Correlation & causation

Every day we see in the news claims such
the ones below. These could be reliable
statistical relationships, but are they causal?
1. Better weather makes people happier
2. Boys who mature later suffer from depression
3. Runners outlive other athletes
4. Kids who were breast feed have a higher IQ
5. There is a negative correlation between # of
hours watching TV and grades in school

Examples:
For each statement provide the causal
story:
1. Women who exercise regularly have
less natural miscarriages.
2. Famous conductors in the US live about
7 years longer than the average
3. Students who come to all the classes do
better

Correlation & causation

• Famous conductors (C) in the US live
about 7 years longer (L) than the
average.

Interpreting correlations

• Sometime we have very strong causal
models (good weather causes happiness,
etc).
• Sometime strong models can be wrong
• Running prevents heart attacks (making
people run can cause heart attacks).
• Watching TV decreases learning

So???

• The only way to draw valid conclusions is
to have a control group!
• In the Uri Geller case we should have
tested how many clocks were observed to
start working 1) on any other hour, 2) if
someone else concentrated, etc.
• In many cases, the only way to have a
good control group is to conduct an
experiment!

Self-selection!

• Runners select themselves
• Famous conductors
• Berkeley

5 year cholesterol experiment

• P(death|no treatment) = 21%
• P(death|treatment) = 21%
• What about regularity?
• P(death|regularity) = 15%
• P(death|non regularity) = 24.6%
• But now we have self selection again
• For regulars P(D|T)= P(D|no T) ~ 15%
• For non regulars P(D|T)= P(D|no T) ~ 26%

Experiments

• Are important but not a perfect method
• They are susceptible to:
• Placebo
• The Hawthorne effect
• Self fulﬁlling prophecies
• Desire to cooperate

Placebo I

• In 1794 Gerbi discovered that by
squeezing a certain worm between the
thumb and the ﬁnger of the right hand,
and placing the ﬁngers on a painful tooth,
the pain went away for a year.
• Hundreds of patients were treated with
this medication, and 68% reported no
pain for a year!

Placebo II

• In a study on the effects of birth control,
three groups were used
• Pills with warning of side effects
• Placebo without warning of side effects
• Placebo with warning of side effects
• Group #2 reported 6% side effects
• Groups #1 & #3 reported 20% side effects

Placebo III

• Old French medical book suggest to use
new medicines as fast, when its healing
power is the strongest
• Probably when the physician believes
in it the most

Placebo V

• The Hawthorne effect
• In 1924 a study was done on
effectiveness at work
• The recommendation was to improve
lighting condition
• This helped for a while but not long
term
• Other changes had the same effect …. 

Placebo -- summary

• Placebo are real and strong effects
• Threatens the conclusions of many
experiments
• Important to have good controls
• Placebo is real:
• Opioids
• Sensitivity
• Attention

Self  fulfilling prophecies

• Teachers who are told that some kids are
very smart, ﬁnd that these kids get better
grades
• Researchers who believed that they have
genetically inferior rats found them to have
a lower performances
• Smart Hans …

Desire to cooperate

• In many cases subjects want to help the
experimenter.
• If you tell subjects what is your
hypothesis they will help you ﬁnd it..
• This is why we prefer blind experiment
• Even better are double blind experiments
• Computer controlled experiments are
another approach.

Some answers

Q1: Cholesterol & hear t diseases

• A large study in Framingham found that people with high
cholesterol levels are much more likely to have heart
attacks
• It was also found that diets and medication can reduce
cholesterol
• Physicians recommendations for diets and medications
reduced heart attacks only by a small number and did not
reduce mortality!
• What is going on?

Not clear.  Maybe the link is not causal

Q2: Uri Geller

• In one TV show Uri Geller told the viewers
that he will activate broken clocks in their
homes.
• After he concentrated, many people called
Text
in to report that their clocks started working
• Does this means that Uri Geller had such
powers?

No, he was a fraud.

Q3: Reward and punishment

• It has been well documented that reward good
behavior is more effective than punishing bad
behavior.
• It was also observed that in ﬂight school
complementing excellent performance is usually
followed by bad performance, while criticizing
bad performance is usually followed by better
performance.
• What is going on?

Regression to the mean

Q4: The “hot hand”

• Many people believe that athletes (such as
basketball players) can be in a state called
“hot hand.”
• They are more likely to score after they
have just scored
• The hot hand can have many reasons
• But, is it real?

It is not real

Q5: Discrimination?

• UC Berkeley in the fall of 1973
• 8,442 men and 4,321 women applied
• 44% of the men and 35% of the women
were admitted
• The quality of the applicants was the
same
• Is this discrimination?

Not necessary -- “the Samson paradox”

Q6: Stock predictions

• One stock broker correctly predicted 7 of
the 9 downturns in the economy over
the past 3 years
• Is he an expert? 
• Do you want to invest with this person?

What about the other predictions?

What if this person said “down”34 times?

Q7: Medical diagnosis

• Imagine that a blood test identiﬁed a person with
a rare disease (base rate of 0.1% in the
population).
• This test identiﬁes as a positive result 98% of
the people who have the disease but also 4%
of the healthy population.
• Given this performance, how likely is it that the
person who was identify as have the disease
indeed has it?
0.0239%

Q8: “The bible code”

• It turn out that if you start from the last letter of
the ﬁrst word in the bible and count every 50th
letter, you get the word “TURA” -- which means
bible in Hebrew
• There are many such examples of hidden
meanings and this has been suggested as
evidence that the bible was not written by men.
• What do you think?
“War and peace by Dostoyevsky
shows the same effects

Evidence….

• We encounter evidence like those
presented here every day.
• We make inferences based on such data
and sometimes even make
recommendations.
• We should try to think critically about data,
whether it is research, our research, or just
the news.

Summary

• People are bad measurement devices
• We observe and infer “rules” where there are non!
Correlations / causation
Self-selection
Placebo / the Hawthorne effect
Self fulﬁlling prophecies
• Statistics and research methods are here to
protect us against ourselves!

Reading some more:

• A Prayer Before Dying (story in Wired magazine)
• In July 1995, back when AIDS was still a death sentence,
psychiatrist Elisabeth Targ and her co-researchers enrolled 20
patients with advanced AIDS in a randomized, double-blind pilot
study at the UC San Francisco Medical Center. All patients
received standard care, but psychic healers prayed for the 10 in
the treatment group. The healers lived an average of 1,500 miles
away from the patients. None of the patients knew which group
they had been randomly assigned to, and thus whether they were
being prayed for. During the six-month study, four of the patients
died - a typical mortality rate. When the data was unblinded, the
researchers learned that the four who had died were in the control
group.

All 10 who were prayed for were still alive.

What are good questions?

Applied or theory?
Applied meaning you are trying to
estimate particular parameters
Examples: Politeness, opening doors, etc.
Theory meaning you are trying to
understand a directional effect
Examples: Politeness, opening doors, etc.

What are good questions?

Applied or theory?
Applied is more speciﬁc, theory is more general
Eng ineering vs. Science
“There is nothing more practical than a good
theory”  (Kurt Levin)

At what stage of product development is each more
appropriate?
When is represented sampling more important?
When is exact implementation more important?

What are good questions?

Relevant is a good criteria
But relevant to who?
“Big” is a good criteria
More general (theoretical) questions
are likely to be “larger” & more
relevant

Ethnics in research

There have been a lot of cases of abuse
Medical cases where they gave people different
diseases.
Shaking basic beliefs
Philip Z imbardo’s jail experiment
Stanley Milgram’s Electrical shocking experiment
The Human subject review board COUHES is the
local branch that is in charge of ethical behavior
toward subjects
URL: http://web.mit.edu/committees/couhes/

Being wrong

It is ﬁne (good?) to be wrong

The important think is knowledge

If you are wrong, try to ﬁgure out
why. Hypothesis or method?

It is good to be wrong

try to venture out, take risks 

Exercise in generating ideas

In small groups propose questions you
are interested in ﬁnding the answers for.
Practice “armchair” psychology
Think of your own weird behavior (and
on that of the people around you ).
Obser ve, introspect
Also name 3 “bad” (useless) thins to test
