Coherent 

arbitrariness


Stable preferences in an unstable world 


Pricing?


How do we decide if we should buy a cup 
of coffee (for $3)? 

Ideally an internal representation of coffee 
will be compared to price. 

If value > price 

buy ؞

If value < price 

؞
 don’t buy 

Fundamental Values


Economic theories assume underlying 

“fundamental” values.

Rarely, however, is it possible to measure

fundamental values.

Virtually all tests of economic predictions examine

the effect of changes in circumstances on valuation.


Such results are necessary but not sufﬁcient 
condition for fundamental valuation.

Sensitivity to anchors

Context effects 

Simonson & Tversky, 1992


People often have an imperfect

How about new products? 


How much is this sound worth?

How do we set such prices?


How come the the sound is so different 
from coffee? 

Sound should be simpler…


Some intuitions


Can one map the pleasure of a 
chocolate-bar to money? 

Is this mapping immediate & direct? 

How about chocolate vs. ice-cream?

reﬂect the psychology of relative 
valuations

Possible Applications /

economics I

Financial markets (Shiller, 1987)


“Who would know what the value of the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average should be?  Is it really "worth" 6,000 today?  Or 5,000 
or 7,000?  or 2,000 or 10,000?  There is no agreed-upon 
economic theory that would answer these questions.  In the 
absence of any better information, past prices (or asking prices 
or prices of similar objects or other simple comparisons) are 
likely to be important determinants of prices today.” 

Market reactions are sensitive to performance relative to 
expectations (IBM is doing X better than expected) and to other 
relative changes (IBM is buying back X stocks) 

Possible Applications /

economics II

Labor markets Bewley (1998).


“Non-union companies seemed to be isolated 
islands, with most workers having little systematic 
knowledge of pay rates at other ﬁrms.  Pay rates in 
different non-union companies were loosely linked 
by the forces of supply and demand, but these 
allowed a good deal of latitude in setting pay” 

Well being within a company is related to relative 
pay to others and to former levels 

Possible Applications /

economics III

contingent valuation


“valuations of any particular quantity [of a good] 
would be sensitive to its relative position within 
the range selected for valuation, but insensitive to 
which range is chosen, resulting in insensitive (or 
incoherent) values across studies using different 
quantity ranges” Frederick and Fischhoff (1998, 
p. 116)

BUT, within subjects evaluations are coherent


Possible Applications /

economics IV


Criminal deterrence (Ross, 1973)


People seem sensitive to policy changes in 
deterrence (perhaps only short term) 

People seem insensitive to absolute levels of 
probability of punishment 

Reactions to crime also have a very strong 
cultural effects 

Questions for neuro- science


Is there cardinal utility?


When pain is experienced as pleasure 
(and the other way) what is the 
associated brain activity? 

Marketing implications


First price has long lasting implications


Products are comparative in nature 

Understanding what a product will be

compared to is important


Product lines and product extensions
