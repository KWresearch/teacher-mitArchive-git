The psychology of Labor

Standard perspective

The standard perspective is that employers
buy the time and effort of the employees in
exchange for money.

What are some additional assumptions of
this perspective?

What are some of its implications?

Something seem to be missing

What can psychology teach us about labor?

The psychology of labor

Relative vs absolute levels of
compensations

The relationship between payment and
motivation, effort, performance

Low payments, high payments

Labor & meaning

Sabotage

Relative vs absolute levels of compensations

Relative vs absolute levels of compensations

Person A gets $80,000 in a company where
the range is $80,000 - $100,000

Person B gets $70,000 in a company where
the range is $50,000 - $70,000

Who will be happier? Who will work
harder? Who will stay longer with the
company?

What job will you select?

Salary & happiness

So, happiness is at least partially
determined by relative salary

Relative to what?

How would you order the different
effects?

What is the largest deraminant of them

Implications

How would you keep your employees
happy with their salary

How would you compensate them?

What structural changes could you take

How would you deal with salary decreases
and retirement?

The relationship between payment and
motivation, effort, performance

At low levels of payment

A tale of 2-markets

Imagine you are about to move to a new
apartment and you need some help in packing
and carrying your stuff to your new home.

Who to ask for help?

What to promise them as compensation?

Imagine that you start a new company.  How
would you want to pay your employees?
Hourly? Monthly? With cash or with cash & gifts?

Fiske’s Rational theory (1992)
Four basic types of social relationships:

Communal Sharing (CS)

high-level of cooperation, equal treatment of all, and “we-ness.”

Authority Ranking (AR)

A clear superior-subordinate relationship.

Equality Matching (EM)

Combine features of CS and AR relationships – they are very structured but with
perfect equality.

Market Pricing (MP)

generally consist of on-going cost/beneﬁt analysis and participants are paid for
their labor via a wage rate that reﬂects the amount and quality of the work
performed

Hypotheses
The relationship between payment and
effort will depend on the type of exchange
(money vs. social markets).

In Money-Market relationships effort will
be exerted according to the reciprocity
theory.

In Social-Market relationships, effort will
be shaped by the altruism theory and will
not be sensitive to the level of payment.

What about not paying?
Rich background in social psychology

Dissonance / intrinsic & extrinsic motivation

Plus some interest in economics (e.g Gneezy &
Rustichini 2000 a & b)

Two-markets

What can shift people from one market to the other?

In cases when both social and money aspects are
present, which will “win”?

Hypothesis:

Introducing monetary payments into a social
exchange will cause individuals to shift from
perceiving the exchange as a Social-Market to a
Money-Market, and effort patterns will follow.

Conclusion Exp3

The similarity between the cash and
$candy conditions suggest that mean
mentioning $ is sufﬁcient to change the
type of relationship from social to
money markets

No payment is a social market and thus
higher in effort

General discussion

Mark Twain ends chapter 2 of Tom Sawyer by noting that:

“If he (Tom) had been a great and wise philosopher, like
the writer of this book, he would now have
comprehended that work consists of whatever a body is
obliged to do, and that play consists of whatever a body is
not obliged to do.”  He than continues and adds that
“There are wealthy gentleman in England who drive four-
horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily
line in the summer, because the privilege cost them
considerable money; but if they were offered wages for
the service, that would turn it into work, and then they
would resign.”

Other examples
Paying for help seem to dramatically change the nature
of the help

“I am not chagrinning you because if I would, you
would not be able afford me”

Paying for sex seem to dramatically change the nature
of sex

“The most expensive sex is free sex” -- Woody Allen

“The big difference between sex for money and sex
for free is that sex for money usually costs a lot less”
-- Brendan Behan

Summary

Paying changes the nature of labor

The currency of payment (and the link
to effort) also inﬂuences the nature of
labor

Companies can strive to have a mix of
social and money markets in their
relationships

The relationship between payment and
motivation, effort, performance

Large Stakes
&
Big Mistakes

Incentives

Incentives are an impor tant par t of the
labor market

The basic assumption is that increased
(decreased) payment for per formance
will cause individuals to work more
(less)

Non-per formance based, and long
term payments are more complex ...

High incentives @ work

Stock brokers:
commission compensation + bonus

P&G par tner adver tising agencies: 
payment-by-results

National federations in soccer World Cup:
payment-by-round

Students at school: “payment”-by-evaluation

Farm labor, Sales peoples, etc.

Incentives & per formance

Incentives do not always behave as
we would expect

Decreasing incentives to 0 can
increase ef for t (Lepper, Green & Nisbett 1973;
Gneezy & Rustichini 2000; Heyman& Ariely 2004)

What about increasing incentives?
Can they be counterproductive?

No obvious dif ference in pattern of
per formance across the dif ferent game types

Except for 1 case (i.e. Labyrinth) there was
no (marginally) significant dif ference in
per formance between low and mid payment
conditions

Per formance always lowest in high payment
condition when compared with low and mid
payment conditions together

Predictions?
Can people predict this?

The ef fect of very high incentives
would be of no consequence if
people know about it and avoid
incentives that are too high for
par ticular tasks & individuals

The prediction study (I)

We described the India study to 60 students 

Students had to predict the results for Simon &
Packing Quar ters:

Fraction of par ticipants who would reach
P(Good) & P(VGood) in each of the 2 games &
each of the 3 payment conditions

Incentive: students were paid by accuracy of their
prediction (max of $10)

Predictions: implications

Students do not seem to have an
intuitive understanding of the possible
negative ef fects of very high incentives

Do others?  Do HR exper ts understand
this?

Do companies set very high incentives
for other purposes?

Implications

Providing incentives are generally
costly for those providing them,
raising contingent incentives
beyond a cer tain point may be a
losing proposition

Other questions
Can people get used to high
incentives?

How high is too high?

Would breaking bonuses into many
smaller bonuses help?

What kind of tasks are more likely to
have negative ef fects of very large
incentives?

Summary
We of ten assume that higher incentives
increase per formance (perhaps in a
diminishing returns)

These results show that higher incentives
can decrease per formance

Labor & meaning

Why do people work?

The standard view is that people exchange
leisure for labor in order to get $.

What are the implications of this view?

Nothing else matters

People should stop working once they
have reached their level of optimal
returns

The meaning of labor

Build Lego for pay ($3, $2.70 etc.)

2 conditions

Sabotage

Overall summary: Topics

Relative vs absolute levels of
compensations

The relationship between payment and
motivation, effort, performance

Low payments, high payments

Labor & meaning

Sabotage

Overall summary

Labor is complex

People work for many different motives and
incentives

Figuring out these motives can help making
emplyees happier and more productive

Labor is not more rational than other
aspects of our life -- and it is important to
ﬁgure it out
