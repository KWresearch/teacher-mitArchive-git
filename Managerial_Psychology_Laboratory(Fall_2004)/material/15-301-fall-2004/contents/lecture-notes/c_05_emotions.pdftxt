Emotions

We arrive at the truth, not by the reason
only, but also by the heart.
                   -- Blaise Pascal

The Human Brain

Animal Emotions

The limbic system is often thought of as a primitive
part of the brain as it is present in lower mammals
and parts are even found in reptiles.

Animals need emotions to survive - they need fear
as a trigger to escape predators and aggression to
defend their territory, young and food.

Darwin thought emotions were merely left over
from our animal past.

Limbic System: Amygdala

What do we know about
emotions?
• Emotions are fast
• Triggered automatically
• Triggered by the environment
• Moderated at least partially by cognitive
processes
• Transitory

Emotions, causes or outcomes?
• I run because I am afraid? or Am I afraid because
I run?
• Does it make sense that we could “read” our
emotions?  How would we do it?
• One view is that emotions are basic automatic
programs, that when executed just “run” without
the ability to interrupt
• Examples: fear or heart-beating creates
attraction

Emotions, causes or outcomes?
epi-phenomenon or everything?

• Qualia (the subjective experience of
emotions) can be considered as nothing
else than a side-effect of emotions
• Is it a needed side effect?
• What is the value of feeling emotions?

A few speciﬁc effects

The durability bias

• Relates to the inability to predict adaptation
• People over-predict the duration of emotional
responses
• How long will I feel sad after a break-up?
• How long will I feel happy after getting an A
in 15.301?
• How long will I be angry at...

“muscular emotions”

• Nodding can have an effect on evaluations
• Similar effects can take place for holding
pencils, pushing or pulling furniture etc.
• Relates to the idea that we can’t
directly read emotions and instead we
read our actions.

Is it better to use
emotions or to think?
• The answer is not always clear
• Sometimes thinking more helps consider other
possible consequences and long-term effects
• Sometimes thinking too much can make us
choose the wrong outcome

Wilson & Schooler
• “The disruptive effect of analyzing reasons”
• Students were asked to evaluate strawberry
jams / posters
• Some just made a choice and others were asked
to deliberate and think about it carefully before
making their choice
• Who do you think was happier with the product
(and how would you measure it)? Why?

Emotion summary
• Emotions are a powerful force
• Emotions are an important input to decisions --
small and large -- but often we don’t recognize
their effects
• Emotions provide a different type of input to
decisions than the cognitive system
• Emotions are: fast, triggered automatically,
triggered by the environment, and transitory

Emotions vs cognition

• Hot & cold states
• Hyperbolic discounting
• Self-control

Cognition vs emotions
• How much are we influenced by
these two systems?
• Affect has the capacity to turn us
into virtually different people

Simple systems: men

• Two main questions
1) How do people change their
decisions under different
emotional states?

2) Can they (we) predict this
change?

DM under emotional states

• Hunger
• Thirst
• Anger
• Curiosity
• Arousal -- seems more fun to
study

What kind of DM?

• Preferences for different activities
• Willingness to take risks
• Willingness to engage in
undesirable behaviors

The procedure
• Subjects got a laptop, took it home
and used it to answer questions
• Two conditions
• Cold -- not aroused
• Hot -- aroused
• Only males
• we are currently testing also
females

Preferences ...

Sample questions on preferences
• Are women’s shoes erotic?
• Can you imagine having sex with a man?
• Could you enjoy sex with someone you hated?
• If a woman proposed a threesome with a man,
would you do it?
• Is a woman sexy when she’s sweating?
• Would it be fun to get tied up?
• Can you imagine getting sexually excited by contact
with an animal?
• Do you prefer to have sex with the light on?
• Is “just kissing” fun?

Results: preferences

• In a cold state, our
participants predicted they
will not* enjoy these activities
• In a hot state our participants
predicted they will enjoy
these activities

Risk ...

Sample questions on risk
• If you pull out before you ejaculate, a woman
can still get pregnant?
• Can a woman who is a good friend give you a
sexually transmitted disease?
• Would you trust a woman you’ve just met
who says she is using birth control?
• Birth control is the woman’s responsibility
• A condom decreases sexual pleasure
• Would you use a condom even if you were
afraid that a woman might change her mind
while you went to get it?

Results: risk
• In a cold state, our
participants were not willing
to take much risks
• In a hot state our participants
were willing to take more
risks
• Condom related decisions
seem different

Sample questions on
undesirable behaviors

• To increase the chance a woman will have
sex with you, would you:
• take a date to a fancy restaurant?
• tell a woman that you loved her?
• encourage her to drink?
• slip a woman a drug?
• Would you keep trying to have sex after
your date says “no.”

Results: undesirable behaviors

• In a cold state, our
participants were not willing
to engage in these behaviors
• In a hot state our participants
were willing to take engage in
these behaviors

Summary
• Individuals have dif ferent preferences /
attitudes under dif ferent emotional states
• Individuals cannot predict this ef fect or intuit
their preferences under a dif ferent emotional
states
• (even common emotional states)
• This can lead to many types of undesirable
behaviors ......

Hyperbolic discount summary
• Hyperbolic discounting means that we want
one thing at time t1, another at time t2 and
regret it at time t3
• The distance to the goal (time, but also physical
distance) changes preferences
• This can create inconsistent time (distance)
preferences
• Hyperbolic discounting can arise from the “hot-
cold empathy gap”

Self-control
This is another aspect of the

Impulsive shopping 
Drug usage
Unsafe sex
Not saving
Nail biting
Not going to gyms
Curiosity
Procrastination
Teen driving patterns

Overcoming self control problems:
Can, and how can, we ﬁght it?

• What tools?
• What strategies?
• What work?
• What will not work?

"He nodded, drawing deeply on the
cigarette. American.  Low tar and
nicotine.  He'd had some trouble  ﬁnding
that kind over here, and he had paid four
times the stateside value.  But the French
brands he had tried had made him cough.
Besides, he hoped that hard-to-ﬁnd
expensive cigarettes would help to keep
his habit in control" (Morrell 1982, p.6).

"There are indeed some people not
habitual drunkards, who cannot keep
away from any alcohol they may have in
the house: so they pay the retailer a very
high wage for taking charge of their stock
of it, and serving it out to them a little at a
time..." (Alfred Marshall, 1919, p. 814).

Mechanisms for self-control

Rules of behavior (I don’t do X)

Pre-commitment (Agreeing to deadlines)

Rationing (limiting consumption)

Physical distance (e.g., alarm clock across the
room)

Mental budgeting (e.g., "entertainment
budget")

A few market mechanisms

Paying in advance for the gym
Paying premiums for large / small packaging
Vacation homes (time sharing)
Others?

If people take such steps it means that
sometime they (we) understand self control
problems and try to overcome them.
How good are we in this?

Can we overcome the problem?

• Awareness

– Do people have a self-control problem
with procrastination? Yes
– Do they know it? Yes
– Do they use self-imposed deadlines to
curb it? Yes
• Performance

– Do they use self-imposed deadlines
optimally? No, but it does help

Self-Control problems examples
Over eating (diets; fat farms)
Impulsive shopping (lists) 
Drugs usage (pre-commitment)
Unsafe sex (advertising, planning ahead)
Not saving (Christmas clubs; Freezing credit cards; direct
deposit)
Nail biting (bitter nail polish)
Not going to gyms (paying in advance)
Curiosity (?)
Procrastination (public deadlines)
Teen driving patterns (immediate punishment)

Self control in animals

Procrastination: Example

“If once a man indulges himself in
murder, very soon he comes to think
little of robbing; and from robbing he
comes next to drinking and Sabbath-
breaking, and from that to incivility and
procrastination”

Thomas De Quincey (1785-1859)

Self-control summary

How come we do things we don’t want to?
Different selves?  Different timeframe?
“Hot cold empathy gap”?
Can we do anything about it?
Strategic self-imposition of constraints on
future behavior and choices can help but
they need external mechanisms

Emotions summary

• Two systems:
• Cognitive: Cold, conscious, deliberate
• Emotion: Hot, fast, instinctive
• Sometimes the output from the two
systems is different:
• Hot & cold states; Hyperbolic
discounting; Self-control
