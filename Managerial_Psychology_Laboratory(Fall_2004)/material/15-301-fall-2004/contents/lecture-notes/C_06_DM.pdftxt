Decision making

Visual illusions as a metaphor for DM

Decision making

A perspective on behavior as a collection of
decision making tasks.

Both explicit and implicit decisions?

Sometimes decisions determine behavior
and sometimes they are an epi-
phenomenon

Economic theory is based on naive
psychology, decision-making attempts to
create a descriptively accurate foundation.

Econ vs. psych

Economics is a science that
describes how people should
behave --> rationality

Sometimes it is confused with how
people behave

Mostly by economists

Psychologists attempts to describe
how people behave! (and why)

Our goal

To illustrate some fundamental
dif ferences between rationality and
behavior

Dif ferent assumptions / ef fects /
behaviors lead to dif ferent
implications

The Rational agent model

Calibrated
Well informed
Ordered preferences
Stable preferences (mostly about tangibles)
Controlled
Selfish
Calculating
Implications
People maximize
What ’s knowable is known
All oppor tunities exploited
Need no protection from themselves

The “Boundedly rational” model

Mediocre judgments
Incoherent preferences
Impulsive and myopic
Reciprocating, trusting and vindictive
Variable tastes (poorly predicted)
Malleable preferences
Implications
People “solve” local decisions
(context dependent, reference
dependent, myopic, biased)
Require paternalistic attention and
help???

Too much choice?

The spotlight effect

Magical thinking

Regret

Regret I

Who would feel more regret

Person A who missed his plane by
2 min

Person B who missed his plane by 2
hours and 2 min

Why?
What does that mean?

Regret II

Who will feel happier

Winner of the silver medal or the
bronze medal in the olympic
games?
Why?
Other predictions?

Regret III

Who would feel more regret

Person A who had a tree fall on their car

Person B who took a dif ferent drive home
and had a tree fall on their car

Why????

Counter factuals !!!

Regret & Markets

What are some market
mechanisms to increase regret?

What are some market
mechanisms to decrease regret?

Regret

Regret is a power ful force

People care not only about states
but also about their state relative
to other states

But, not all possible other states,
just a few that come to mind ...

Context ef fects

People use context to evaluate the
focal options.

Implications.......

Context ef fects

Lessons:

Evaluations and choices are relative

People use the context to infer value

Decisions are hard, relative decisions
can be easy

Too much choice ?

Defaults & too many
options

Which would you pick
Case I: You plan to spend the evening in the library working on
a short paper due the following day. As you walk across campus
you discover that an author you have always admired is about to
give a public lecture. Do you proceed to the library anyway or
go to the lecture instead?

Case II: You plan to spend the evening in the library working on
a short paper due the following day. As you walk across campus
you discover that an author you have always admired is about to
give a public lecture and that—in another hall—they are about
to screen a foreign movie that you have been wanting to see. Do
you proceed to the library anyway, go to the lecture instead, or
go to the movie?

Which would you pick
Your patient is a 67-year-old farmer with chronic right hip pain.
The diagnosis is osteoarthritis. You have tried several
nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory agents (eg. aspirin, naproxen,
and ketoprofen) and have stopped them because of either
adverse effects or lack of efﬁcacy. You decide to refer him to an
orthopedic consultant for consideration for hip replacement
surgery. The patient agrees to this plan. Before sending him
away, however, you check the drug formulary and ﬁnd that there

Case I: is one nonsteroidal medication that this patient has not
tried (ibuprofen). What do you do?

Case II: are two nonsteroidal medications that this patient has
not tried (ibuprofen and piroxicam). What do you do?

What should we do?

A few options or many?

Jams, 401K, Movies, dating , etc.

How would these influence:

Approach & decisions?

Defaults?  -- How could we use these?

Defaults & complexity? -- How could
we use these?

The “spotlight” ef fect

The “spotlight” ef fect

People think that other pay a lot
of attention to them

The “Barry Manilow” ef fect

Magical thinking

Magical thinking I
How attractive is a chocolate shaped
like a cockroach? stool?

Magical thinking II
How would you feel drinking from a
brand  new bedpan?

Would you burn pictures of your
loved ones?

Summary

Decision making summary

We do it all the time, but how?

One analogy: visual illusions --fast, most ef ficient, but
susceptible to mistakes & to context influences

Some specific examples:

Regret

Context ef fects (ADS & Compromise)

Too much choice?

magical thinking
