From here, there are not many opportunities to deviate 
Now is the time to get serious about your research projects 
From now on, when you submit a paper, also submit the previous version of the 
paper

After you start data collection, there is less and less opportunity to change 
This is a crucial time of the semester 

COUHES website self tutorial - you have to take it before Wednesday 
(Human rights w/ subject - what can and cannot do) 

The topic today is decision making 

When we talked about Perception we looked at visual illusions 

One perspective on decision making that says the way we make decisions is similar 
to the way we look at visual illusions 
What are visual illusions?  What are some of the aspects we found apparent? 

-something not there 
-suggestion for blank space like the grid 

What in the visual illusions we talked about give us hints about the way we make 
decisions? 

Remember the Stroup test? 

-words of colors, printed in other colors 
This showed that there are some things we do so well that it is really hard for us to 
do otherwise 

Some people suggest that a good way to think about decision making is to make an 
analysis of visual illusions.  Some things we naturally do well or don’t do well, some 
things we learn, we over-learn, we keep on doing them. 

Today we’ll talk about a few of those.  We will basically cover 5 topics in decision 
making.  We will learn something about all 5, but it of course goes beyond the 
specific examples 
(slide) 

What is decision making? 
There is a perspective in psychology that says everything people do in terms of 
changes (how people change over time) is a decision.  Not that every word I utter I 
think about, but the perspective is that you would think of everything as a decision. 

It is important that sometimes a decision is deliberate and we think very carefully 
about it.  Should I study for the exam?  Or should I maybe go see the last game of 
the Red Sox? 
Sometimes the deliberation is after the fact. 

If we think about the decision to come to MIT, many people had a very simple 
decision – well, my parents told me I need to go there so I went 
But Later on they reason about it, after the fact 

Decision Making as a discipline is on the opposite side as economics, it is the 
evil twin of economics.  While economics is thinking about rational human beings, 
Decision Making looks at how people are not necessarily rational when they make a 
decision and looks at how people behave under those circumstances. 

(comic slide) 
Cartoon, king says to the guy in the pit, prove your guilt or innocence by the door 
you pick.  One door has a dragon, the other has a beautiful maiden. Which door do 
you pick?  The guy says - the one with the gorgeous maiden. 

This cartoon is to illustrate that the decisions that are most apparent to us are the 
difficult decisions: where to go to graduate school, what job should we take, who to 
marry, should we ask for a raise, should we quit our job?  But in fact we make a 
million decisions a day that are easy, like the one about the door, or not to cross the 
street on a red light, or we decide not to kick the people who are standing in front of 
us in line.  We do all kinds of things all the time that involve decisions, but we make 
them very fast and not interactive.  The decisions we will talk about here are not 
these decisions we make all the time, but the hard decisions, those that are more 
difficult. 

We make a million decisions a day, most are very easy 
Most are fast, accurate 

Say we design a human being 
If we think about how we want a human to behave, it would be the rational view. 

Instead, the perspective of Decision Making and psychology is how people actually 
behave and why they behave that way 

Conflict – economics and psychology comes to play 

Assumptions for Rational agents (slide) 

People know what they know 
I know I like Mac more than PC 
Like cheese more than broccoli 
I know these things 
And we are in control, we can control ourselves, self control 
We are selfish, we maximize our own utility 
We are calculated

Lecture 6

In contrast, the perspective we will talk about today is that people are not as  

calculated and selfish.  People are compulsive and myopic, we will talk about

hyperbolic discounting when reciprocating, when someone is vindictive


“Boundedly rational” (slide)


From Ernst Berndt’s research:  


I give you $10, you can give to Leonard as much as you want, he can accept or  

reject.  If he accepts, both of you get your share. If he rejects, you both get nothing.    


How much do you give Leonard?  

-5 
Why 5?  

-So he will accept


So, if you were a rational economist, you would say, Leonard would be happier with  

a dollar than with nothing.  So if I offer him a dollar he will be happier with than

without, so he will accept.  But this is a more vindictive style.  You are saying, if I  

give him 3 even, he would lose $3 just to punish you by more, so therefore you have  

to be nice to him.  


Topics today (slide) 

Anybody here ever experience regret?  Anybody not?  Nobody is raising their hand in

either choice.  Try again.  Examples, what is regret?    

-not sleep enough last night  

-take more than 4 yrs to graduate  

-going to MIT in first place  


What causes you to regret something?  


-possibility of a better outcome  


If MIT only school in world, still regret coming?  


-probably 

Why? 

Only regret if compare, consider other alternatives.


Who will regret more:  miss plane by 2 min, or miss by 2hr and 2 min?  

-2 min  

Very strong feeling that person A would regret more, why is that?  

-closer to target  

To what?  

-could have made it

Can easily imagine that person A could have made it.


Like we said before, regret is not about current state, about what we can easily 

imagine are alternate states  

Happiness not determined by what have, but by what we don’t have. How easy it is

to imagine what we don’t have. 


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 6 
Page 3 of 11 

If we just look at other possible states, how many possible states are there?  

-infinite 

Infinite number of possible states.  How do we do that?  Compare ourselves to  

infinite number of possible states?  When we think about coming to MIT, What are

we comparing self to?  

Shoot, I came to MIT, I could have won the lottery!  


Lots of options, possible states, how do you decide what you compare yourself to?  


-other people states that discuss with  

-if don’t like MIT, visit friend, see people have fun…

Easy to imagine, because you have a friend going somewhere else  


Someone missed plane compare to alternate state – what easy to imagine in those  

particular circumstances.  


Happiness is not only your state, but also other possible states.  Not all possible  

states, but in particular those that are easy to imagine being in.  


Can start thinking how to use regret to motivate 

You want to create a state of comparison that would make people think about one

thing vs. another 


Medal (slide)


Who would be happier, someone who won the silver, or who won the bronze medal  

in the Olympics?  

-Bronze 

Why? 

-wouldn’t expect the gold, at least they got a medal  


If silver, could have gotten gold


Think about grades in class, what implications?  

-B- happier than B+  

If you were a professor, what would you do to make students happy?

-straight A’s ☺

-not plus, they would argue for a better grade.  

A very difficult problem  

High counterfactuals – could have done more  


Others? 

-break bad news – describe worse situation, then say what happened  


Movie, father comes home, son says, terrible news, cat climbed to the roof, fell,

eventually died  

Father says, shouldn’t tell all of a sudden like this – should ease in slowly, nice day,

played with cat, cat climbed…  

Son –says, well father, I had a very nice day playing with mother, … 


How did we get there?  


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 6 
Page 4 of 11 

Show how things could be worse  


-increase car price $2000, reduce when bought  

What’s one of the biggest things in life where we try to minimize regret?  

market mechanisms go around regret?   

-product bought, then see one similar for less, rationalize  

Nobody wants to be a fool.  

What do companies do here to reduce regret?

-SRP – suggested retail price  

-find price better elsewhere, give you $back  

Assurance you will not regret

Return policies  

Return if want, not have to regret.

Insurance – not feel loss


Another Question  

2 gambles (slide)

Which would you choose?  


Would you want to see what happened to other gamble? 

-no 


Don’t want to know what could have happened  

Don’t want to be confronted by the other thing – what could have happened  

Ignorance is bliss  


Slide (regret 3)  

Who more unhappy when car hit by tree  

Same road every day or different route every day?  

-person B  

Why? 

Easy to imagine, could have chosen different route that day  


Normal circumstances  

Not likely to regret if follow routine  

More likely to regret if deviate  


Talked about market mechanisms to increase regret, decrease regret   

think about these, I would like to ask you more on the final


That was regret 


context effects 
people don’t have absolute perspective, but perspective is largely relative. 
relative like ice cream in different cups, use cup to figure out how much ice cream 
you are going to get 
don’t necessarily know what we like, we use context to infer what we like. 

An example, attribute 1, 2 
Product a, b each with attribute 1, 2, but better at different ones 

Introduce Dominated alternative – an alternative worse on everything 

15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 6 
Page 5 of 11 

Question is, can it influence your choice?  

A way to think about it:

Go into ice cream store  

Chocolate vs. vanilla  

You say, give me vanilla

They come back, oh, we have strawberry too  

Oh, if you have strawberry, then give me chocolate  

Strange – choice between chocolate, vanilla should be independent of if they have  

strawberry 


Asymmetric dominance (slide)  

A’  

-provides context for A

Easy to see A is superior  

So pick A instead of B  

Why? 

Can reason A over A’, clear  

Hard to decide A vs. B  


Say I offer a weekend in Paris or weekend in Rome  

What would you choose?

Weekend in Rome with espresso, or Paris?  


Rome with espresso, Rome without or Paris?  

Espresso not a big difference, but makes it apparent that espresso Rome is better  

than without in Rome  


Now you work for Ford, sell cars, what do to sell better?  

How do we use the asymmetric dominance effect?  

-introduce weaker Ford Focus, little worse in every aspect – a little less $ too  

More convinced to buy regular one  


Bread maker  

Introduced, $400, nobody bought  

How much bread have to consume to make it worth the price?  

Market research – what needs to be changed to improve this breadmaker?  

Add timer, set overnight, fresh bread when wake up  

$450 w/ timer  

400 w/o  

What do you think happened?  

People bought w/o timer 


If new product introduced to the market, hard to figure out if worth it or not.  Could  

think about $400 worth of bread. How long to justify, with ingredients, etc.  


But with, without timer, something to compare, people say, $450? vs. $400, forget 

about the timer, don’t need a timer. 


Market by itself, hard to reason if worth it  

Comparing is much easier  


Another effect is the Compromise effect  


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 6 
Page 6 of 11 

People will pick the middle alternative between 2 options.

Can be vastly different choices, but people will compromise.  


Another example  


company tried to distribute cheap condoms in Bangladesh for population Control,

help people with family planning

Turns out, there was a mildly expensive product and cheap product.  What do you  

do? 

Not for profit, wanted people to buy cheap condoms  

offered another slightly more expensive cheap condom   

if 1 costs $2, 1 cost $.10, you think it can’t be right.  

choice space  


Economist subscription  

Web $59  

Print $125  

Both $125  


These are smart people offering these choices.  

Friend at Columbia replicated this for an experiment

What do you think happened? What was market share of 3rd? 

Went up from like 30% to 70%, something like that.

These smart Columbia MBA students who know the magazine are affected by giving  

3 choices vs. 2  


People use context to evaluate options.  They try to be objective, but is very hard

Come back to this throughout semester 


If think about how happy you are, compare to those around you  


Happy with starting salary? People around you?


Some decisions very hard to make 

Using context makes life simpler  

Because relative advantages are more obvious.  


Decision difficulty  

Too Much Choice 

Can you have too much choice?  What do you think is too much choice?  

-all options similar, hard to pick  

-unfamiliar options – uncomfortable  

-like all – conflict


Have you ever encountered a situation where you had too much choice?  

-sandwich shops – million breads, cheeses, etc  

Chinese restaurants an expert at this – how many combinations they can make  

- pick ties from grandfather 3/hundred, had to rank all to find just 3 
-choosing career 
Big book of careers, could go through all of them, at the end of the day not know 
which to pick.  What else? 
-cereal

Ah, good.  I don’t see how people do that 

Slide – which would you pick? 

1 temptation, choose temptation  

2 temptation, stick with default, go to library  


Slide 2 which would you pick

(2 conflicting temptations you like)  


How many would go to movie or concert?  

Less, why? 


Go to library, 1 temptation, go to temptation  

Go to library, 2 temptations -> go to library  


w/ 2 temptations, have to make tough decision.  people not want to give any up.  

Easier to stick w/ initial plan.


Ex. 

Expert physicians (slide)

Realize 1 drug not tried before – try it first (ibuprofen)  

2 – refer to specialist  


These are expert physicians in their field, but give them 2 choices, they get so

baffled, just refer to another expert


Very easily to give people too many options  


Say you were part of CUP, committee on undergraduate performance.  

You decide curriculum for MIT  

How many options do you give your students?  

We have a lot of choices.  Would you restrict # of options?  

No, why not?

-I like my options  


How many would go to an institution that would not let you choose, who said we are  

going to decide for you?  Very few, right?  

People want options.  They don’t do well with options, but they want options.  


Fundamental dilemma:

Like options, but don’t do well with options  


If we ask the physicians if they prefer us to tell them 1 drug existed, not tell about 2,  

they say no, want to know what exists.  But they make worse decisions if knew more  

options exist  


-MIT, we have a lot of options, but they are very constrained.  


Constrained options – better than regular, but still options  

Even in very small numbers, options can be too many.  


Example – jam study  


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 6 
Page 8 of 11 

By Anger, who used to be a faculty member here  


Booth in supermarket  

6 jams displayed - 40% of people approached  

24 jams displayed - 60% of people approached 

Supports idea – more options, people like it.


People sampled about the same number of jams in each case – 1.4, 1.5  

Gave them coupons – see how many bought  

Buy w/ coupon 

30% - 6 jams  

3% - 24 jams  


Shina has a new paper on this 

Retirement, 401k plans  

When I came to MIT, there were 3 options  

Then there was this whole big thing, we moved to Fidelity, and now there were  

thousands of options.  


What is the effect? 

More options, fewer people joined.  

3 options, I’ll choose one, thousands, I’ll do it tomorrow.

If I join, more likely to join something like a money market – very low returns  


Other things with lots of options – anyone tried online dating?  

You know MIT has a dating site? Matchup?  

It’s great, you should try it out.


If you go to a dating site, how many people are there? Thousands!  How easy is it to  

make a choice when there are so many people who may be compatible?    

Very very hard.  


Moving – if you have not moved for a couple of years  

Often there are so many options that people give up.  


Direct contrast to society  

Need consumer choice, consumer freedom.  

Superficial freedom – we can make more choices, but we don’t  


Can think about this in marketing, but how do you want a company to operate – how 

to have people make choices, not necessarily more options.  Healthcare would be the  

same. 


2 social psychology aspects  


The “spotlight” Effect

Volunteer. 

Choose song, tell me.  

Tap it out on the board  

How many people do you think recognized the song?  


Most think others will, but they don’t 


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 6 
Page 9 of 11 

We focus on ourselves very heavily, think others focus on us 

People think others pay a lot of attention to them 

“Barry Manilow” effect  

College students

Wear T shirt to campus party  

-thinks everyone saw, ruined his reputation  

At party, almost nobody had noticed  


-do embarrassing thing, think people notice  


Things more or less likely to do because of spotlight effect?  

-time getting ready  

-makeup 

-careful, for good impression, prevent trip  

-prevent stealing 

Think everyone notice  


People think they convey thoughts, from a look  

Convey something about what they are thinking – not true.  


Magical thinking


Chocolate cockroach  

Would you eat?  

Why would it be disgusting?  

You’re not eating a cockroach, your eating chocolate.  

-thinking of roach whole time  

Voodoo dolls  

Fact that it’s shaped like a cockroach gives some characteristics of a cockroach  


Bedpan, new, put lemonade in 

How much pay you to drink?  

A lot  

Same plastic as cup, though  


Original purpose sticks to things  


Burn pictures of people you love?  

Digitized, don’t need  


Why hard burn, shred  

-like burn in real life

Like voodoo  

Most have intuition,that this is hard to do  

Something about the person sticks to the picture.  


Paul Rosen

Darts 

Picture of JFK, Sadaam Hussein  

Paid for accuracy.  


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 6 
Page 10 of 11 

JFK people missed more  


Revolver, into pieces  

Asked to assemble  

Spin chamber  

Put to temple

Pull trigger  

Nothing would come out! No bullets!  

Very very hard to do anyway.  


OJ Simpson’s house impossible to sell  

Why? 

Many Murder, crime houses, difficult to sell  

Law - have to tell of crime when you sell the house  

People not want contaminated house, by certain kind of death  


Sweatshirt company, “AIDS” 

How well would it do? Anyone buy?  Why not? 

Words make it harder to swallow 


Summary 

Decision making 
Many w/o thinking – talking, walking, driving 
Metaphor - like visual illusions 
People do things naturally, are trained to do them, learn to do them 
Not always correct, but do very easily 
Not talked about difficult, heartwrenching decisions - another day 

All kinds of things the system does not do well 

Regret - nobody wants to be a sucker 
Not think about what we have, think about what we don’t have, and specifically 
those things that are easy to imagine. 

Context effects 
Not understand value, context helps figure out 
Too much choice 
How buy cereal? how pick job? 

Social effects 
Spotlight effect 
Magical thinking 

Meaning of objects stick to them, even in other contexts 

Wed exam, bring calculator 
Friday experiment
