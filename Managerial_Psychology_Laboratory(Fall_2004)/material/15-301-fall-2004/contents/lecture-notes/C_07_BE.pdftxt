Behavioral Economics:

decision making
& opportunities ?

It is all about

Free lunches !

“Free Lunches”

In Economics there is no free lunch

Standard economic theory assumes that all
agents (consumers and organizations alike) are
rational agents working effectively to maximize
their own welfare.  Since all actors in the
marketplace are assumed to be at a state of
maximized returns, it follows that there are no
“free lunches.”

After all, the world is optimal at its current state

“Free Lunches!”

In Behavioral Economics there are are all kind of
inefﬁciencies, and thus many free lunches

The emerging ﬁeld of behavioral economics
routinely demonstrates that individuals and
organizations do not maximize their own
welfare and instead follow suboptimal decision
strategies and succumb to different decision
traps.

While this view of human rationality can be a
bit depressing, it also implies that the
marketplace is full of free lunches.

Differences have implications for:

Theory

Individuals’ decisions

Businesses’ strategies and offerings

Policy (taxes, medical insurance, welfare,
infrastructure & educational investments,
role of EPA, the efﬁciency of free markets
etc.)

Psychological views on rationality

Bounded Rationality:
(Herbert Simon, 1957)
A human mind has limited information processing and
storage capabilities, humans must use simple rules of
thumb and heuristics to help make decisions and solve
problems.

Systematic Cognitive Biases:
(Kahneman and Tversky, 1974)
Many heuristics, or simple rules, that people use to
make judgments and decisions lead to systematic and
predictable errors.

Investments Ia

As the president of an airline company, you have invested $10
million of the company's money into a research project. The
purpose was to build a plane that would not be detected by
conventional radar,. When the project is 90 percent completed,
another ﬁrm begins marketing a plane that cannot be detected by
radar. Also, it is apparent that their plane is much faster and far
more economical that the plane your company is building. The
question is: should you invest the last 10 percent of the research
funds to ﬁnish your radar-blank plane?

NO - It makes no sense to continue spending money on the project.
YES - As long as $10M is already invested, I might as well ﬁnish it.

Investments Ib

As the president of an airline company, you have invested $1,000 of
the company's money into a research project. The purpose was to
build a plane that would not be detected by conventional radar,.
When the project is 0.01 percent completed, another ﬁrm begins
marketing a plane that cannot be detected by radar. Also, it is
apparent that their plane is much faster and far more economical
that the plane your company is building. The question is: should
you invest the last 99.99 percent of the research funds to ﬁnish
your radar-blank plane?

NO - It makes no sense to continue spending money on the project.
YES - As long as $1,000 is already invested, I might as well ﬁnish it.

Sunk cost

The investment size should not relevant
to the decision to continue or not.
This is called the sunk cost effect

Losses are more painful
So we try to eliminate or delay them
Thus, invest more because we are
already “deep into it”

Buying tickets for a BB game

You have a ticket for a basketball game. The
drive is 60 miles, it snows and the roads are bad.
Is the likelihood that you will go to the game
different if:
A) you paid $10 for the ticket yesterday
B) you paid $100 for the ticket yesterday 
C) you paid $100 for the ticket last year 
D) you got the ticket for free 
E) you got the ticket for a discount

Actions are considered as deviations from
the status-quo

Deviations are losses and gains from that

Loss aversion

The common ratios of the effects of gains
and losses across many studies is 2:1

Loss aversion is the cause for “timid
decisions”
Particularly when considering decisions
one at a time

Equity premium puzzle I

The equity premium puzzle
Stocks have been outperforming bonds 
Large difference between rate of return on
equities and treasury bills.
Yet many people invest in bonds

A dollar invested in stocks on 1/1/26, would yield
$1800 in 1/1/98
A dollar invested in treasury bills 1/1/26, would
yield  $15 in 1/1/98

Equity premium puzzle II

 Variance in returns can cause people to
experience loss aversion frequently
 As a consequence the “pain” of stocks
will be higher than the “pain” of bonds

Risk taking by professionals

 Zur Shapira (2000) found that:
 Traders took riskier positions the following
day if they ended the previous day with a
loss rather than a proﬁt.
 Traders also showed a tendency to take
‘long shots’ in the last hour or two of trading
at the end of the day if they were in loss at 3
o’clock.

Investments by individuals

 Observation: The propensity to sell winners
is twice as large as the propensity to sell
losers (except in December)
 Why?
 People hold separate ‘mental accounts’ for
different stocks
 For each stock they store the original buying
price (which  is irrelevant)
 As a consequence people hold on to
“losers” too long

The disposition effect:

 The propensity to hold onto losers has
been called by Odean the disposition
effect


 The buying price for each stock  is a
salient (yet irrelevant) reference price
 Leading to reluctance to realize the
loss by selling “losers”

Behavioral economics: summary

People behave in a way that is
different from standard economics

Sometimes we can model these
behaviors and incorporate them into
economics

Prospect theory captures some of the
differences in a simple form, and
with many implications
