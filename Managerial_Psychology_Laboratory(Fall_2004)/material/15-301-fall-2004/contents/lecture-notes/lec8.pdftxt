Lecture 8: The Psychology of Money 

Welcome to the most exiting class so far 

Focus on one research project today 

We are talking about the psychology of money. 


Generally, how do we decide, when we go to ABP if we should pay 2.79 for coffee?

Everyone here has bought coffee before? 

How do we decide if it is worth it or not? 

When were you last in a coffee shop? 

-a week ago

Okay, so we go up to the counter, look at the coffee menu, what were you thinking? 

-sugar in coffee 

Want sugar in coffee, that’s free, what else? 

-flavored, caramel 

Okay, so we’re talking 5.25.  How do you decide if you want it or not?

-how much money in pocket  

Let’s say you just got paid, lots of money in pocket 

Does it make a difference? 


How do we make that decision?  


In theory, we are supposed to be able to evaluate how pleasurable something is for us. 

Cup of coffee, trip to Jamaica, whatever it is. 

Somewhere in our brain, imagine 0-100, how happy it makes us, map to money 

We can say, oh, this makes me happy .35. is that worth $2 or $3?

Have this meter, in theory.  Is it worth that?  Then we decide to buy this thing or not. 

The thing to understand is that we can decide to change how much we want coffee every 

minute.  Give us very diff level of pleasure in the morning, in the evening, when hungry, 

when thirsty, when tired, when not.  That’s fine.  But every moment, we are supposed to 

be able to map to how much we pay 

In theory, If internal value higher than price, we buy.  If lower than the price, we don’t 

buy 


How much pleasure seems very hard  


Idea of internal understanding of amount of pleasure is called Fundamental Values 

Basic encoding of some quality that we understand deeply and can evaluate internally 

how much value it gives  

However, it’s very hard to measure fundamental values. How do we measure?

-relative, Mercedes better than Ford 

Ok, you like one car more than another 

Change price of cigarettes, gas, see if consumption goes down.  Change level of access 

and see how people change their minds. Can do all these relative things.  But hard to 

evaluate absolute level, measure 


Maybe one day, direct brain connection, give us amount of activity in cell and give us 

exact level of pleasure. 


Both cases what we do is we don’t have absolute levels, we have relative tests 

And relative tests fit with the idea of fundamental values, and therefore we say it’s 

possible we have fundamental values. 

For example, if we double the price of cigarettes, consumption goes down, fits with idea 

of fundamental values 

Increase price enough, drop smoking altogether 


Psychological perspective on preference 

Fundamental values is one way to thing about preferences 

Remember when we talked about listing Multiple reasons why love our SO?

That indicated that people don’t know their preferences, right?  That it’s easy to confuse 

them. 


An experiment 

Had roulette wheel, spun the roulette wheel, came up with a number.  74.  Then they 

asked, are there more or less nations in the UN than 74?


-less 

How many nations are there in the UN? 

-50 
And it showed that people who got high numbers, gave high numbers. 

People who got low numbers gave smaller 

Use the number to decide how many nations are in the UN 

Context effect 


2 weeks ago we talked about 

Asymmetric dominance 

Compromise effect


All those things show people have imperfect comprehension of their own values 

How do these things fit together? 

Economics predicts the fundamental values, psychology tells us we have very fuzzy 

preferences.


(Sound) 

How much would I need to pay you to listen to this sound for 1 min? 

Write down a number.  

Now this sound is very simple. You all know what it’s like, right? I don’t need to play it 

again, it is clear to you, you know what it is.  You don’t need any more new information.  

So let’s get some numbers. 

10, .10, 1, 2 , 1, 2, 10 dollars 


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 8 
Page 2 of 15 

As you can see, there’s a big variance in how much people want to do this.  It was what, 

10 cents to 10 dollars. 


Say I sold can of coke,.  I have a can of diet coke here, 

What is max you would pay for it?

$1, 2, .01, 0, 0 


Except for the difficult people here who don’t like diet coke, or don’t like coke, or don’t 

like the question.  Otherwise the price you’d pay is what its worth.  The variance on the 

annoying sound is going to be very high because it’s very hard to know how much you 

want to listen. 


For coke, variance small -$0.50 to $2 for people who like Coke 

We run into problems because everyone does not like Coke, but this is assuming 

everyone likes it. 

One of the questions we’d like to ask is how come there is so much variability in the 

valuation of the sound, and how come there is such a low variability in the valuation of 

diet coke? 

The suggestion here is we have no idea how much we like diet coke.  But somebody told 

us once how much diet coke costs and we paid what people told us we should pay for it. 


When we buy things in the market, we don’t buy them based on what we like and what 

we don’t like or how much we like it, we buy them based what someone told us we 

should pay for it. 


That’s what its suggesting, when somebody sold you Coke, they could have charged you  

$10 for it, and then you could pay $1 a can for wine.  Diet coke could be more expensive  

than wine. 


Why are the sounds so difficult compared to chocolate or Coke or other things? 


Present another intuition


If I ask you right now, what would you prefer to have, 

Godiva chocolate or ice cream?

A choice that you can seemingly easily make. 

Anyone have hard decision? No 


On the other hand if I say, given this piece of 

Godiva chocolate, give detailed description, what is the maximum amount of money you  

are willing to pay for it?  Is it an easy decision or a hard decision?  Much harder, right? 

We can decide if we want chocolate or ice cream much more easily than we can say what 

is the maximum amount we are willing to pay for a piece of chocolate. 

The argument is that it is hard to map hedonic pleasure to money 

But when have two things next to each other, two goods, we can decide which one we 

like more.

What I presented so far 

In economics, we have a theory of fundamental values. A theory that people would know  

how much they value things. 

Psychology says that people have fuzzy preferences, they don’t really know what they 

want. 

These are 2 very opposing theories.  The intuition is, it’s very hard to take an experience 

and decide how much I’m going to pay for it.  


When we look at the marketplace, behavior is predictable 

If we went tomorrow and we increased taxes on cigarettes, or we decreased taxes on 

alcohol, we know what would happen to consumption.  So a big part of the riddle is how 

do all these 4 things happen in parallel?  Or do they? In particular, how can it be that 

there are fuzzy preferences in psychology, that it’s hard to map money to pleasure, but  

nevertheless, it looks like the market is a predictable marketplace. 

If you are an economist at this point, you would say, I don’t understand it, how can you 

say people don’t know preferences for products, look at the marketplace, I can predict it.  

I can predict that if tomorrow, the price of beer suddenly is divided in half, there are 

many more people who would buy it.  So how can you say that people don’t know how 

much they are willing to pay?


Should know how much value (economics)  

Psychology – fuzzy preferences 

Intuition – hard to map to $ 

Market – behavior predictable 


I can predict market, how can you say people not know how much willing to pay? 


But I would say this will still happen, even with fuzzy preferences and even with 

difficulty mapping money to pleasure. 

So let me start by giving you and example of an experiment. 


Min $ to pay, do diff things (slide graph) 

The reason I chose those is they are all things you can imagine to about the same degree. 

Aside from kill a mouse, they were more or less as pleasurable as each other 


Four don’t have a market.  Unlike a can of Coke, painting your face blue or smelling 

shoes, there’s no job like that, no job description or title, recruiting procedure that does  

this job. 


On the other hand these three, walking dog, shining shoes, deliver newspaper, are jobs 

people have and many people have experienced 


What they do is guess the value 

Prediction is that things w/o market, the variation would be very large. People don’t have 

a market price to use as a reference 


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 8 
Page 4 of 15 

For things that have a reference, the value would be much tighter, because instead of 

using their own pleasure for it, people will use the market price. 


Now it turns out I made quite a few big mistakes in this design.   

The first on was the assumption of the jobs on the market. 

Turns out there is a job to smell shoes. 

Competition for the smelliest shoes, (slide, winner) 


Anyway, most people didn’t know there was a job like this. 


Results(graph) 

What happened here is that the variance for jobs that do have a market is very small 

Things w/o market, variance is huge 


We try to use our pleasure, but is very, very hard to do. 


Real experiments 


In the first experiment, here is the problem: 

Brought People to lab (MIT undergrads, MBA students, recruiters) 

Listen to sound in headphones, then divide to 3 groups 


Some asked nothing 

Some, Hypothetically, willing to listen to sound for .10 

rd group, hypothetically, before continue, listen again for .50? 

3

End, had a marketplace, people bid for real for 9 sounds.  Had sounds 10s long, 30s long,  

60s long 

Procedure: 

nd price auction 

2
Who has been on Ebay, raise your hand.

nd price auction: if you and I are bidding for this lovely thing, you think it’s worth $10 

2
and I think it’s worth $3 

In regular, English ascending auction, I would bid 1, you 2, I 3, you 4, and the auction 

would be over.  But both bid a lot of times 


2nd price auction 

Not bid up, 

You say 10, I say 3, you pay a bit over 3.  doesn’t matter how high you bid. 

That’s what Ebay is using. 


Procedure 


Computer generates random number.  If your bid is less, you listen to the sound and get 

paid what the computer came up with.  Best strategy is to say exactly what you are 

willing to pay

Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 8 
Page 5 of 15 

Here some results: 

Slide $ linearly increases w/ duration. 
Average, people wanted about 4x more for 60s sound than 10s sound, 2.5x for 30s and so 
on 
Look at picture, this is the kind of world we have.  The more the rate is, the more people 
want, and it doesn’t seem to matter what position people are in. However, remember, we 
are only looking at relative numbers. 60/10, 60/30, and so on.  In real life, we rarely have 
a way to look at absolute numbers.  Everything we do is just relative.  But if we look at 
absolute numbers, here is what happens: 
People who we asked ? about a lot of $ wanted a lot 
People less money, asked for less 
Not asked were the lowest rates. 
This is saying that the initial question you ask people, would you be willing to pay x, 
influenced their prices long term. 
Think about it, it suggests we don’t really know how much we are willing to pay for 
things.  And answering a question about our willingness to pay might fundamentally 
change how much we are really willing to pay later on. 

If people start answering questions, they answer other questions in a coherent way, but 
we perceive the price as up or down. 

If 1st cup coffee from Dunkin Donuts 20 yrs ago,  you say oh my goodness, should I pay 
.25 small or .35 large? 
But if you are used to the Starbucks world, you are asking yourself, should  I pay $3.50 
for the small or $4.50 for the large?  People are not coherent as to the actual value of 
coffee to them, it is not clearly there 
Even if I take another 100 cups, next month 
Not clear I will understand better next week after buy many more cups, what is the actual 
value of coffee to me.  What is the pleasure that I get from it? 

The category is very important, once we decide on something, other decisions follow in a 
coherent manner. 

So you might say Annoying sound is an odd product, maybe different 
So we took MBA students, gave them these 6 products (slide).  We didn’t tell them how 
much the wine costs, we just gave them the description. 

Then asked, Last 2 digits of Social Security# 
-04 
04 translates into $4, ask if willing to pay that much for each of these products.  And we 
said, just to be clear, that SS#’s are completely randomly assigned.  After that, they bid 
for each of those products 
So what we see here (slide) is people with low numbers, middle numbers, high numbers. 
For example, People with high SS# will pay twice as much for the trackball.  

15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 8 
Page 6 of 15 

For the other ones, it was always at least 1.5x the price 

Now I know what you’re thinking, because I have high SS#, I probably go and pay too 

much for everything I buy.  That is not the case, it would only be the case if you ask  

yourself questions like, should I pay for this item the ending of my SS#? 


Suggests people make foolish, irrelevant decisions about paying their SS#, then 

influences willingness to pay in buying products 

Still, there was a high dependency. 

Everybody locally very coherent – pay more exp wine than cheap, etc 

And you can think about that with other products and ask, how did I end up paying this 

amount? Clothes, for example.  How do we decide?  Clothes have huge variance in 

prices.  Some people spend on their whole wardrobe $17, some people spend thousands 

of dollars.  From the looks, you all fall in the lower category. [laughter] 

And I am too [more laughter]. 


How does a one time decision on initial amount you are willing to pay for something 

make a difference in all these other decisions 


For me, spending 50 on a pair of trousers seems crazy, but not someone else, might be  

cheap – what you are used to 


Could be not a question of value, but what we are used to doing.  


So there is a theory that people don’t know how to value things for themselves 

First became popular by the famous philosopher Mark Twain.  

Anybody not read Tom Sawyer?  You have to read it, it is a great book. 


Mark Twain – tom Sawyer 

Tom caught by Aunt Polly for doing something. 

Must whitewash fence 

Friend comes, poor Tom Sawyer  

He says nothing, friends say poor Tom Sawyer, have to spend Sunday washing the fence. 

He says poor Tom Sawyer, what do you mean?  It’s not every day a kid gets to paint a 

fence.  Besides, Aunt Polly is very particular, she wouldn’t just give this to any kid. 

Friends ask to paint just a little, Tom says, nope, Aunt Polly is very particular. 

His friends not only begged him to paint the fence, which he let them btw, they paid to

paint fence.  He became a wealthy kid at the end of the day 

Ends chapter – if Tom wise as author – he would realize pleasure not in the act itself, but 

if get paid or pay to do it 


In fact, wealthy people in England ride in carriages with horses long distances in sun and 

rain because they say it gives them great pleasure.  But if you paid them 3 pence, they 

would stop immediately. 


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 8 
Page 7 of 15 

So Mark Twain suggest we don’t really know whether things are pleasurable, and 

sometimes, if we pay to do something we think it’s pleasurable and if we are paid to do 

something, we think it’s awful 


So I tested this.  We’ve done about 8, 9 experiments with this.  Some of them were in 

15.301. 


poetry(slide) 

would come to class, read leaves of grass Walt Whitman, then tell poetry recitals 

1min, 5min, 10min 

But small room, not space for everybody, so auction spaces 

Fill out forms to bid 

½ people asked before bidding, hypothetically, would you pay $10 to listen to Prof.  

Ariely recite poetry for 10 min  

I think it was 2% took it 

Other half, before continuing hypothetically tell us if you would be willing to accept $10 

to listen to prof. Ariely recite 

Most said yes. 

Results (graph slide)

people asked willing to pay, pay more for longer readings 

asked get paid, charge us more for longer  

everyone sure more is more. 


But here’s what happened, nobody knows if listening to me recite poetry is pleasurable or 

painful. 


Can easily switch people around zero by asking the right question, and then everyone 

goes in a coherent fashion from there. 


Hard to determine painful or pleasurable.  And so paying or getting paid to do something 

can determine that. 


So are museums painful or pleasurable? 

If we were paid to go, we would probably go even less. 

We can also think about how 

Moving hobby to profession can fundamentally change your enjoyment of it. 


-switch paid/paying for poetry make diff? 

First impression 

Free poetry after answer either question, and see who comes.  And many more people  

who would pay for it came


I’ve done the same thing with experiments on decision making. 

Turns out, don’t have to pay people to come to experiments, Can get people to pay for 

experiment.  In fact, people will pay more for longer experiments.  if ask initial ?s

correctly 


15.301/310, Managerial Psychology 
Prof. Dan Ariely 

Lecture 8 
Page 8 of 15 

If you pay to come to class, pay to do exp, not clear which is more valuable to you, or to 

us. 

Not about how much enjoy, how valuable they are  


Someone figured out 

Pay good money to go to prison for a month, and they are willing to pay for this 

privilege.  The thing about this it is something we put a lot of effort into to try to avoid. 


Other things like that 

How about public talk?  Is it pleasurable or painful?  Most people fear giving public talks 

very much.  They think of it as a very unpleasant experience. 


Self Herding Model 

Restaurant, people in line, think good, more people line up, think better and better 
People assume people in front know more 
w/o carry more info 
when you see one line 1, one line 100, you assume 100 is much more positive, but 
doesn’t have to be 

same happen to you 
go to Starbucks, buy coffee 1st time 
week later, what remember? Thirsty? Tired? 
probably not, just remember there, buy coffee 
let me buy again 
oh, I bought twice, I like it, keep buying 
oh, I am a loyal Starbucks fan 
habit, no longer consider 
more behavior, more powerful  

correct locally, but not rethink problem 
oh, just said more than 50 in UN, stay with that but change a little 

how use in marketplace? 

-encourage customers to linger 
Create herding. 

-free coupons handed out, get process started 
Free coffee, next time remember buy 
Or maybe reduced price, if free you don’t really buy it 

-create association with something else 
I say specifically about price, get people to pay more 
-start high price, then lower it a little

Changed dramatically in 50 yrs 

From $20 to $60, 70 

Collectors’ items, fashion, are things that people can charge a lot for and increase price 


Not same as increase price for same thing  


Scarcity, people willing to pay more 


experiment 

people say “market will take care of it” 


Lowest 3 bids get sound, pay 4th bid price 

People w/ hypothetical ? about $1 wanted much more than .10 

Cheap for us when we said .10 

This much more exp, .50 per trial  


Look at standard deviation of how much people want to be paid – shrunk over time


Each group converge to own level 

People high learned market was high, people low learned market was low


Similar study –people who moved to Pittsburg, willing to pay for housing. 

Influenced by place coming from? 

Looked at from expensive like Boston, NY, from cheap like Ohio, Missouri 

Yes.  Depends on what used to paying.  Can correct for income, etc 

You can find out easily on the web what the market is 


But from NY willing to pay much more than people from Ohio  

Anchoring 

If rented couple years, used to new level of spending, effect went away 


Not clear how effects true preferences.

1st decision makes a big diff 

Want to check that 


In addition, 2 other explanations 

I am a subject, I don’t know anything vs smart, wise experimenter 

If asking question about .50, probably about right.  Let me respect his knowledge 


People who give sounds higher price, find them more painful. 

Influence how perceive sound?


The experiment: 


People came, listen to sound.  Then Hypothetical ? about .10 or .90, bid for real 

Went back, new sound, different kind, white noise, asked about .50, bid real 

rd round, diff sound, asked opposite ? .10 or .90  

3
Crunch finger in carpenter’s vice for 30 sec 


Reason for vice – mapping vs changing utility 


Finger crunched vs hearing sound, direct tradeoff w/o money 

Asked which prefer, finger crunched again or sound again?  

If change, diff in preference between 2 groups, one prefer vice, other sound. 

If pricing not effect perception of sound, no difference in preferences 


Biggest effect – 

1 decision more force than later decisions 

.90 stayed higher price 

No effect vice/sound choice. 

Suggests people want more money for sound not experience it as worse 

Could be other reasons 

Another exp to look into this 


What is the theory here? 

Traditional view – some tradeoff, more duration, more $ want, different people different 

tradeoffs 

Perspective here  – people have big uncertainty – not know value of sound 


What happens, 

Answer question in one range of uncertainty vs other, 

Next time think about it, constrained by the .50 

Shrink area of acceptable tradeoffs

4 pairs yes/no, would take, say $4 to drink from bedpan, then bid for real 

Wanted to know – successful in anchoring? 
Anchor 4 separately, or all stay same w/ 1st anchor? 

Important not only for experiment, but also think about how people anchor in life 
Pay laundry what used to pay for laundry, shoes for shoes, clothes for clothes 

Have all different silos at same time. 

Results 
Successfully anchored different stimuli separately 
However 
When looked at ratio anchor $/pref, no effect 

Can mess up willing to pay, but not direct comparisons. 

Willing to pay not predictor of liking 

Can mess mapping pleasure, willingness to pay 

People not map well 

Some people are better than others – who better able to map? 
-more creative 
No 
-have less money 
Almost.  People who work on hourly wages 

Hard to think about money 
Is this worth working 10 min for? – better able to compare 
People w/ hourly wages, Common denominator more meaningful than money 

Summary  
Economic theory not work well here 
Not really know how much willing to pay 
Map money to pleasure 
Also learned can have these effects simultaneously 
have stable market,  
people act as if coherent 

If predicting for market, can predict well

But if born into world – not clear would change much 


Implications 

Stock market behaves rational – up, down with news 


What does value of stock market really reflect?  


Labor market 


Look at unionized companies, lower supply, demand.  Know about other people 


Isolated island, much more arbitrary  


You know what makes happy w/ salary? What biggest determiner of happiness w/ salary? 

-getting raise 

-friends make 

-coworkers 


Men, women its more complex, but for men it is how much wife’s sister’s husband  

makes

Telling you this – think about how much happiness gain by marrying strategically  

Want to marry woman who’s sister married to bum 

(laughter) 


Anyway, people concerned about how much paid compared to others.  Friends, …
