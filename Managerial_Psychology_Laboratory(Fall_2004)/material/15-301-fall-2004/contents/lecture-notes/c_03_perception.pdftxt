Perception is relative 1

Which one has more ice-cream?

What ef fects could the package have?

Perception is relative 2

Imagine that you are holding a 1
gram weight in one hand, how much
would we have to put in the other for
you to notice the dif ference?

What if you were holding a 1 KG
weight?

Just noticeable dif ferences (JND)

JND

Our perceptual system notices
changes and these changes are
relative to the magnitude of the
experience itself

This propor tion is about constant for
any sense (but dif ferent across
senses)

JND - Weber’s law

I / I = K

I is the intensity

K = constant across levels of
I

Ij / Ij = Kj

j is the sensory domain

The Unbearable
Automaticity of Perception

The strongest knowledge — that of
the total unfreedom of the human will
— is nonetheless the poorest in
successes, for it always has the
strongest opponent: human vanity

Nietzsche, Human, All Too Human

Automaticity
 Automaticity
“... most of a person’s everyday life is determined
not by their conscious intentions and deliberate
choices but by mental processes that are put into
motion by features of the environment and that
operate outside of conscious awareness and
guidance,” Bargh & Chartrand (1999)
 Adaptive
“... consciousness deserts all processes where it can
no longer be of use...We grow unconscious of
every feeling which is useless as a sign to lead us
to our ends, and where one sign will suffice others
drop out,” William James (1890)

Automaticity?

 Why have thing automatic?
 Why is automaticity
important?
 The answer is limited
resources
– The “cognitive miser”

Adaptation I

People are sensitive to changes

We get used to stationary states

Light, shir ts, glasses

Income, lifestyle, well-being?

With diminishing marginal
dif ferences

Adaptation II

People don’t predict their level of
adaptation

The “hedonic treadmill”

Adaptation III

Examples:

Tenure

People who win the lottery are not
as happy as they expect to be ...

California …

Perception: summary 1

Perception is rapid and ef ficient

But, wrong from time to time

This is a tradeof f! Par tially due to
resources limitations

The biases are due to structural,
learned, and attentional issues
