Long Term Memory

Not really long term.  Some things are
constructed, some last forever.
No capacity constraints!
Visual, verbal, conceptual, procedural etc.

Individuals represent stimuli in context-
dependent perceptions; these perceptions are
all the reality for the individual

Constructed memory

The memory myth

We usually think about our
autobiographical memory as a
veridical representation

This is not the case!

Memory is constructed

Evidence (Loftus & Pickrell )

Adult par ticipants were implanted
with a childhood memory that at
age ﬁve they had been lost in a
shopping mall and rescued by an
elderly person.

People falsely remember shaking
Mickey and Bugs Bunny’s hand at
Disneyland

Constructed memory
Evidence from cases of early child
abuse

This is not to say that there is no child
abuse

Some people don’t accept this
evidence

How could you study this level of
constructed memory?

Alien Abduction !

Susan Clancy

Alien abduction
Susan Clancy showed that people who claim
that they were abducted have many more
false positive memories & that they are
higher on the autism scale.

She also proposed a “sleep-awake”
mechanism

This work has help not only to show that false
memory are real and that they have real
impact on people, but helped us understand
the mechanism underlying it.

Source monitoring

Even when we remember we
don’t necessarily remember
where the information is from

Implication

The legal system usually treats
person eye witnesses and memory
as the highest level of accurate
evidence

The same goes in our personal and
professional life

THE MERE EXPOSURE “Costanza” EFFECT:
We like things that are familiar

Evidence for mere exposure

Zajonc (1968) showed Chinese characters to
people from one to 25 times, asking them to guess
the meaning. The more they saw a character the
more positive a meaning they gave.

Miller (1976) showed people posters about
stopping foreign aid up to 200 times. They were
persuaded most by moderate exposure. Af ter 200
exposures they reacted negatively to the message!

Organizational memory

People use memory as a asset and
as a tool to ensure their position

Knowledge management is an
attempt to get out of this problem

Urban legends

This is another version of collective
(constructed) memory

You only use 10% of your brain.

The Great Wall of China is the only man-
made structure visible in space.

Halloween

Newsweek , 1975:
 “In recent years, several children have died
and hundreds have narrowly escaped
injury from razor blades, sewing needles,
and shards of glass purposefully put into
their goodies by adults.”

ABC News poll, 1985
60% of parents worried their kids might be
victims

Urban legends summary

Urban legends are a “collective false
memory ef fect”

Common and interesting

Real ef fects on the market

An impor tant question is what makes
a “good” urban legend?

What predicts that a story will
become and urban legend?

Summary

Memory is complex and important

Memory is about organization and “sense-
making” -- and hence not always accurate.

We have volitional access to some aspects
of memory but not others

Memory is a central psychological process
that almost everything we do depends on.
