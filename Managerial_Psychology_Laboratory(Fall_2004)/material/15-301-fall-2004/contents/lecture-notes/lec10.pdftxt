Lecture 10: Group Decision-Making 

Groups and group decision-making 

Group decisions 

-Where to eat, movies 
-Electing president 
Shows how bad it can be  


Anyone from fraternity or sorority? 

Anybody here have a family?

Make decisions as a family? Only parents?


In fact, Sometimes make decisions yourself, but for a group 

Group decision making very important for 2 reasons: 
a. Spend lot of time in groups 

b. Often Take group into account, how decision affects other people 

I often hear my wife’s voice speaking to me, telling her opinion 

Lets try group decision making exercise 
Show short riddle, 30 sec to read, write own answer 

Ready, set, go… 

(slide) 


Those who think the answer is above 100 come to this corner, below 100, other corner 

Now explain, convince each other, if your answer changes, switch groups 

If have answer for sure, Go to other group, try to convince each other, or sit down 
I suggest you go to the other group 

Observation: above 100 only men, but for 1 

How much started with the right answer? 0 
How many ended up with right answer? 2 

How many changed mind? Few changed mind 

This was my best hope to show you how effective group decision making can be. 
Get together, talk, share info, learn. 

Idea: show advantages of groups 

Rest of class will be about pitfalls, why groups can be bad 

Examples where groups bad in terms of outcome? 

-Mob mentality, Listening to authority 

From your own experience, groups making bad decisions? 

-Coordinate time w/ group 
Taxing 
-people disagree  
Not necessarily bad 
-silence is agreement, but can create problem if not true 
-people dominate discussion 

Bad decision making - great movie at end of class 

mob behavior 
sports game - fire, cars turn over, poles bent 
how do you think it happens?  What happens?  Why? 

LA riots, what do you remember? 
-carnage, fire 
People break into stores, steal, fire, how start? 
National guard can’t contain 
-break law, so many others, can’t be caught.  30 people steal, 31 not going to catch 
-everyone doing it, getting cool stuff, have good time 

One way to think about it -I’m not for stealing, but in this condition 
Or, people change their norms 
Unique in mob behavior, riots – people feel they cannot be singled out 
Just one of crowd 
Consequence:  people don’t evaluate what they are doing, don’t follow social norms 
of regular life – obey parents, don’t steal, etc 

Zimbardo proposed process (slide) 
Not feel singled out 
All of us together 
Not think about selves, what do I stand for? 

Consequence, people don’t evaluate what they are doing 

Obey norms of local group created 

Football team wins over another 
England, for example, people die over soccer 
Change way they think once these conditions happen

Example of how social norms can be broken due to anonymity  

Experiment, students in dark, start walking around.  Told to not say anything about  

themselves (slide)  

Once anonymous intro, no name, darkness  

Talked about personally relevant stuff

After about 40 min, started to get interactive  

90% indicated touched someone on purpose  

20% said trying to keep people from touching them  

50% hugged somebody else  

80% said they were sexually aroused  


Very different in real life.  Stick 6 students in room, hour later 50% hugged?  

Something about the anonymity allows people to behave apart from the norm.

Shows the power of anonymity  


Girl studying in next room, subject asked to shock her if she is not studying well 

Anonymous more likely to shock her  


Not identified, you do all kinds of things not normally do  


NY, very terrible case, girl raped, screamed, but nobody did anything because lots of  

people heard  

“Someone must be doing something” 


Another study  

Students, some guards, some prisoners.  For weekend. 

What didn’t expect was that guards started abusing the prisoners  

Had to stop the experiment, couldn’t last the whole weekend  

Were told nothing of the sort.  They took it upon themselves to do this.  

Stockings on head, stand in line, strip searches, paper bag on head  

Fellow students at Stanford  


Remind you of anything recently in politics?  


Take relatively well meaning kids, probably raised well, make some prisoners, some  

guards, start behaving very, very different  


How likely if take people opposite side of war, not abuse if get chance?  

Not far fetched, actually expected  


Mob & deindividuation – conditions where group can create a bad outcome.  

There is no leader, no sense of responsibility, social norm  


Follow emerging norms  

One person starts, other people follow  

Can get worse and worse 


Basically what happens is people don’t want to be embarrassed.  

Take silence, lack of action as indication that these people understand something,  

know something  

Pluralistic ignorance I

While I might know something, if others behave differently, doubt my own 
motivations 

Prof give incomprehensible lecture 
Some students even nod favorably 

Not only class material, but also more serious 

Experiment: Smoke into room.  More people present, longer to leave 
Very hard to be the first one to leave 
If alone, just leave.  If many people there, say oh, nobody’s leaving, and everyone is 
thinking that. 

I did some work on poltical correctness 
Can’t conduct it at MIT, you guys not politically corrrect at all 
At Princeton very successful 

Harvard, interviewing for new faculty 
Wanted more African American faculty 
All tried to say this research and that, not talk about African American 

-can you elaborate on how we not PC, Princeton are? 

One example: PC game, line of people, FBI most wanted game.  Have to 
communicate to another person which name is highlighted.  The question is, Will 
they use race? Green sweatshirt standing by the car.  People uncomfortable using 
race as a name to call people. 
At MIT, people completely don’t care about using race as indicator 

U Virginia study 
White, Black, wheelchair person to convince people of something stupid 
Should do an exam on all the college material 
Black, wheelchair much more convincing 
Argument is we don’t like to argue w/ people we are PC about 

“if I say they are wrong, they will think I’m racist or something” 
Video takes away this effect, no longer face to face 

Idea is that people will do stuff if they think other people are doing the same thing. 

Conformity 

Norms for how well dressed  

At MIT  

Other places  

Not deviate from those standards  


If people free to do as please, they imitate one another.  


Monty python: Life of Brian  

Brian stands at a window, all people come to him as an apostle,  

He says: Your all different!  

They drone: “we’re all different”

You don’t have to follow me!  

We don’t have to follow you  


Subtle conformity, mimicry  


Sit across from you  

If I rub my face, you more likely to rub you face


Want to increase liking, going to mimic  

You rub face, subject more likely to rub face than shake foot,   


Homework: Go home, do something, see if can get roommate to follow  


Rational conformity  

Maybe they know something  

2 Fire exits  

Fire starts  

Run to exit  

Somebody must know something, lets run after them  

Nobody sees other exit sign, only others running  


Slide, which line longer

Experiment, group of people  

All but one working for him, told what to answer.

(wrong answer)  

Question: Will the subject also give the wrong answer?  

Picture of subject first time.  Can’t believe his eyes, how can that be?  

75% of people conformed.  This is about vision, something we no is good, no reason  

to doubt  

Lots of people gave the wrong answer for conformity reasons  


Bigger conformity to groups you want to be a part of, larger groups  


Conformity: sometimes you do not know you are conforming  


3 things to remember today  


Prisoner experiment, Asch  


75% of people gave wrong answ at least once  

This is vision test  

No reason to doubt eyesight

More conformity in larger groups, diff tasks, high desire to be part  

Like fraternity, sorority  


Conformity @workplace 


Sometimes conformers not know conforming  

Others, we know we are conforming


Suggests social info might change perception  

Increase activity in visual cortex

Not necessarily know truth but not say to not embarrass self 

Conform for different reasons 

Workplace, people usually want opinion, but being the person saying no always is 
not a fun task 
Faculty member, I have privilege of doing so often here 
People annoyed 
But very important 

Conformity – one of the worst outcomes for groups. 

Obedience 
Very strong form of conformity  

Was it WW2, Germans?  Happen to anyone?  


Experiment - Stanley Milgram  


Video 


Not sadistic, wanted to stop  


Half got to end, subject stopped talking  

Is incredible!

Nevertheless easy to get social norms created in the moment  


Summary 

Groups can be useful, more viewpoints etc  

Can hinder what useful for 

Authority or not

Asked explicitly or not

All dress same, obey rules  


Compliance – no authority 

Obedience – authority, asked explicitly


Mob behavior  

Probable ignorance  

Conformity

Obedience  


One more plea for wednesday  

Writing instructor here  

You need help w/ writing, you should come
