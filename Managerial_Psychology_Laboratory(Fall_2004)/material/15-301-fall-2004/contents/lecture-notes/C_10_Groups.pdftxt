Buying a necklace
A woman buys a $78 necklace at a jewelry 
store.  She g ives the jeweler a check for $100. 
Because he doses not have the $22 change on 
hand, he goes to next merchant and exchanges 
the check for $100 in cash.  He g ives the 
woman her change and her necklace.  She 
leaves and never returns.  The check bounces 
(for which the bank charges $15), and he must 
make it good to the other merchant.  He 
orig inally paid $39 for the necklace.  What is 
his net loss?

•  What happened?: 

—First, explored space and “chatted.”
—Soon discussion turned to “extremely important” matters.
—After 40 minutes, started to engage in physical “interaction.”
—90% indicated touching each other on purpose.
—Only 20% attempted to keep others from touching them.
—50% hugged.
—80% reported being sexually aroused.
