Problem  1 Romer Problem  4.3  (First-order  autoregressive  shocks)

Let  ln A0  denote  the  values  of A  in period  0,  and  let  the  behavior  of  ln A  be  given by


¯
˜
ln At  = A + gt + At , 
˜
˜
At  = ρAAt−1  + (cid:18)At ,  s.t.  − 1 < ρA  < 1, 
˜
where  A  is  an  input  in  the  production  function,  known  as  technology,  and  A  reﬂects  the 
fact  that  technology  evolves  according  to  a  random  process,  speciﬁcally,  a  ﬁrst-order  au-
toregressive  process.

1.  Express  ln A1 , ln A2 ,and  ln A3  in  terms  of  ln A0 , (cid:18)A1 , (cid:18)A2 , (cid:18)A3 , A,g , and  ρA . 

2.  Given that expectations of the (cid:18)A  ’s are zero, what are the expectations of ln A1 , ln A2 ,and

ln A3  given  ln A0 , A,  ρAand  g? 

Problem  2  Augmented Romer Problems  4.4  and  4.5 

Suppose  the  period-t  utility  function,  ut , is  ut  = ln ct  + b(1 − lt )1−γ /(1 − γ ), b > 0, γ  >  0.

(Note  that with  γ = 1,  utility  reduces  to  the  form  seen  in  class:  ut  = ln ct  + b ln(1 − lt ).)

1.	 Consider the household’s problem of maximizing utility sub ject to a budget constraint 
c = wl  where  is  c  consumption,  l  is  hours worked,  and w  is  the wage.  Find  the  ﬁrst 
order  conditions  and  solve  for  the  labor  supply.  How,  if  at  all,  does  labor  supply 
depend  on  the wage? 

2.  Consider  an  extension  to  the  previous  problem. 
Instead  of  a  static  problem,  the 
consumer/worker lives two periods (and discounts second period utility by 1+ρ .) There 
1
is  no  uncertainty. 

(a)  Write  the  lifetime  budget  constraint. 
(b)	 Write  down  the  ﬁrst  order  conditions,  and  solve  for  the  relative  demand  for 
leisure  in  the  two  periods. 
(c)	 How  does  the  relative  demand  for  leisure  depend  on  the  relative  wage?  Show 
that an increase in both w1  and w2  that leaves w1/w2  unchanged does not aﬀect 
l1  or  l2 . 

α(AtLt )1−α ,  0  < α <  1.  Solve  for  wt , the 
(d)	 Suppose  output  is  given  by  Yt  =  Kt
wage  rate  (assume  labor  is  paid  its  marginal  product).  Now  suppose  there  is 
a  positive  technology  shock  at  time  1,  A1  =  A,  A >  1  (assume  that  at  time  2, 
technology  returns  to  A2  = 1).  What  is  the  eﬀect,  if  any,  on  the  relative  wage 
and  on  the  relative  demand  for  leisure?  Does  it make  sense? 
(e) 	 How  does  the  relative  demand  for  leisure  depend  on  the  interest  rate?,  on  the 
time  preference  rate? 
(f )	 Explain  intuitively  why  γ  aﬀects  the  responsiveness  of  labor  supply  to  wages 
and  the  interest  rate. 
(g)	 Solve for the Euler equation, that is express the relationship between c1  and  c2 . 
What  if  ρ = r? 
(h)	 Now  assume  that  the  household  has  initial  wealth  of  amount  Z > 0.  Does  the 
Euler  equation  derived  in part  g  continue  to  hold?

Problem 3 Romer Problem 4.8 (A simpliﬁed RBC model with additive technology shocks). 
Consider an economy consisting of a constant population of inﬁnitely-lived individuals.  The 
representative  individual maximizes  the  expected  value  of 
∞X 
1 
(1 + ρ)t 
t=0 
2 , θ > 0 
where  u(Ct ) =  Ct  − θCt 
Assume  that C  is  always  in  the  range where  u0(C )  is  positive.

Output  is  linear  in  capital,  plus  an  additive  disturbance:  Yt  =  AKt  + et .  There  is  no

depreciation;  thus  Kt+1  =  Kt  + Yt  − Ct ,  and  the  interest  rate  is  A.  Assume  A  ≡  r  =  ρ.

Finally,  the  disturbance  follows  a  ﬁrst-order  autoregressive  process:  et  = φet−1  + εt , where

−1 < φ < 1  and where  the  ε’s  are mean  zero,  i.i.d  shocks.

1.	 Find the ﬁrst-order condition (Euler equation) relating Ct  and expectations of Ct+1 .(Hint: 
set  up  the  Bellman  equation  and  maximize  w.r.t  Kt+1  after  substituting  for  Ct  as 
functions  of Kt , Kt+1  etc.) 

2.	 Guess  that  consumption  takes  the  form Ct  = α + βKt  + γ et .  Given  this  guess,  what 
is Kt+1  as  a  function  of Kt  and  et? 

3.	 What  values  must  the  parameters  α, β ,  and  γ  have  for  the  ﬁrst-order  condition  in 
part  1  to  be  satisifed  for  all  values  of Kt  and  et? 

4.	 What are the eﬀects of a one-time shock to ε (suppose ∆εt  = 1) on the paths of Y , K, 
and C  ?
