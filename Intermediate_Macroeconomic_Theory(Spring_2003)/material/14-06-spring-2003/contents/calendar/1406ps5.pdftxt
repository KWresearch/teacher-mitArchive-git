Problem  Set  5 
(due on the day of Lecture # 7) 

Problem  1  (Unanticipated  and  anticipated  changes  in  government  expenditures) 
Consider  the  decentralized  Ramsey  economy  with  government  expenditures  of  problem  2 
part  5  in  problem  set  4.  Recall  that  the  dynamic  system  associated  with  this  economy  is 
given  by 

k˙ t  = f (kt ) − ct  − g − nkt , 
ct  = σ(ct )(f � (kt ) − ρ − n), 
˙
ct 

where  the  initital  per  capita  capital  stock  k0  is  given  and  the  paths  of  consumption  and 
capital  satisfy  the  transversality  condition  limt→∞ ktu� (ct )e−ρt  = 0.  Here  g > 0  is  the  ﬁxed 
level  of  per  capita  government  expenditure  per  unit  of  time.  Assume  that  at  time  t  = 0 
the  economy  is  in  steady  state,  i.e.  k0  satisﬁes  f � (k0 ) =  ρ + n,  and  that  it  has  been  in 
steady  state  for  some  time.  Suppose  that  at  time  t  =  0  the  government  permanently 
reduces  government  expenditures  from  g  to  gL  where  0 ≤ gL  < g .  Moreover,  suppose  that 
this  change  is  unanticipated  (if  it where  anticipated,  families would  adjust  their  behaviour 
already  before  time  t =  0  and  it  may  not  be  reasonable  to  assume  that  the  economy  is  in 
steady  state  at  time  t = 0). 

1.	 Draw  the  phase  diagram  corresponding  to  the  old  level  of  government  expenditures 
g ,  including  the  saddle  path.  How  does  the  reduction  in  government  expenditures  to 
gL  change  the  phase  diagram  and  the  steady  state?  Indicate  in  the  phase  diagram 
how the economy adjusts to the unanticipated reduction in government expenditures. 
Sketch  the  time  paths  of  per  capita  capital,  consumption  and  government  expendi­
tures  (starting  at  some  time  t < 0). 

2.	 Now  suppose  that  the  reduction  in  government  expenditures  at  time  t = 0  continues 
to be unanticipated but  is known to be  temporary,  i.e.  families anticipate a  return  to 
the old  level of government  expenditures g  to occur at  some  time  t¯ > 0.  Is  it possible 
for  consumption  to  jump  at  time  t  =  t¯?  Repeat  the  analysis  from  part  1.  How  do 

the  answers  depend  on  the  duration  of  the  reduction  in  government  expenditures? 

3.	 Next  suppose  that  at  time  t  =  0  the  government  announces  that  at  time  t >  0 
government  expenditures will be permanently  reduced  to  gL .  So between  times  t = 0 

and  t  =  t  the  old  level  g  still  applies,  and  the  reduction  to  gL  at  time  t  is  now 
anticipated  (but  the  announcement  at  time  t  =  0  is  unanticipated).  Repeat  the 
analysis  from  part  1. 

4.	 Finally suppose that at time t = 0 the government makes an unanticipated announce­
ment  that  government  expenditures  will  be  reduced  to  gL  between  time  t >  0  and 
t¯ > t,  i.e.  now  the  reduction  is  both  anticipated  and  temporary.  Repeat  the  analysis 
from  part  1. 

Problem  2  (The  stability  of  ﬁscal  policy)

Let G(t) and T (t) denote government’s  real purchases and  tax  revenue at  time  t.  Then  the

ﬂow  budget  constraint  of  the  government  is  given  by

˙D(t) = r(t)D(t) + G(t) − T (t) 

where D(t)  denotes  the  amount  of  debt  outstanding  at  time  t.  The  rate  of  change  in  debt 
outstanding D˙ (t) is the budget deﬁcit, while G(t)− T (t) is referred to as the primary deﬁcit. 
D(t)
Deﬁne  d(t)  to  be  the  ratio  of  debt  to  output  d(t) =  Y (t) .  Assume  that  Y (t)  grows  at  a 
constant  rate  g > 0. 
Assume  that  the  interest  rate  is  an  increasing  function  of  the  debt-to-output  ratio:  r(t) = 
r(d(t)),  where  r � (·) > 0,  r �� (·) > 0,  limd→−∞ r(d) < g  and  limd→∞ r(d) > g . 
˙D(t)
1.  Suppose  the  budget  deﬁcit  to  output  ratio  is  constant:  Y (t)  =  a,  where  a >  0.  Find 
an  expression  for  d˙(t)  in  terms  of  a,  g  and  d(t).  Sketch  d˙(t)  as  a  function  of  d(t).  Is 
this  system  stable? 

2.	 Suppose that the ratio of the primary deﬁcit to output is constant and equal to a > 0. 
Find  an  expression  for  d˙(t)  in  terms  of  a,  g  and  d(t).  Sketch  d˙(t)  as  a  function  of 
d(t).  In  the  case  where  a  is  suﬃciently  small  that  d˙  is  negative  for  some  values  of 
d,  what  are  the  stability  properties  of  the  system?  What  about  the  case  where  a  is 
suﬃciently  large  that  d˙  is  positive  for  all  values  of  d?
