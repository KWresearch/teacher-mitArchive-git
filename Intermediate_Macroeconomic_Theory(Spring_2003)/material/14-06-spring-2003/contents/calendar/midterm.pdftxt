14.06 Macroeconomics 
Spring  2003 

Midterm  Exam 

Instructions:  You  have  90  minutes  to  complete  the  exam.  Please  be  concise  and  write 
legibly.  There  are  two  parts:  part  A  is  worth  40  points  and  part  B  is  worth  60  points. 
Answer  all  questions  in  both  parts,  using  a  separate  bluebook  for  each  part. 

Part  A  (True,  false  or  uncertain)

Say whether  the  following  statements  are  true,  false  or  uncertain.  Justify  your  answer  in  a

couple  of  paragraphs  (10  points  per  statement).


1.  An  economy  that  increases  its  saving  rate  will  experience  faster  growth. 

2.	 Once  human  capital  is  included,  the  Solow  model  does  a  good  job  at  explaining 
observed  per  capita  income  diﬀerences  across  countries. 

3.	 Growth  theory  predicts  that  poor  countries  should  grow  faster  than  rich  countries, 
and  researchers  have  found  the  evidence  to  be  consistent  with  this  prediction. 

4.	 A Ramsey economy that starts above the golden rule capital stock will converge to the 
golden rule.  But if it starts below the golden rule it will also converge to a level below 
the  golden  rule  because  impatient  consumers  are  unwilling  to  sacriﬁce  consumption 
during  the  transition. 

Part  B 
Consider  the  following model  of  growth.  Output  is  given  by 
Y (t) = K (t)α [A(t)L(t)]1−α . 

Capital  and  knowledge  accumulate  according  to  the  equations 
s ∈ (0, 1), 
φ ∈ (0, 1). 

K˙ (t) = sY (t),
A˙ (t) = Y (t)φ ,

The  population  grows  at  rate  n. 

1.	 Give  an  economic  interpretation  of  the  equation  for  the  accumulation  of  knowledge. 
(5  points) 

2.  For  what  value  of  φ  does  this model  reduce  to  the  Solow model?  (5  points) 

˙
A˙ (t) 
K (t)
3.	 Let  gA (t) =  A(t)  and  gK (t) =  K (t)  be  the  growth  rates  of  knowledge  and  capital, 
respectively.  Find  expressions  for  gA (t)  and  gK (t)  in  terms  of  A(t),  K (t)  and  the 
parameters.  (5  points) 

4.	 Diﬀerentiate  to  obtain  expressions  for  g˙ A (t)  and  g˙K (t)  in  terms  of  gA (t),  gK (t)  and 
the  parameters.  Draw  the  phase  diagram  in  (gA , gK )  space.  (10  points) 

5.	 Does  the  economy  converge  to  a  balanced  growth  path?  If  so,  what  are  the  growth 
rates  of K ,  A  and  Y  on  the  balanced  growth  path?  (5  points) 

6.	 How  does  an  increase  in  s  aﬀect  long  run  growth?  What  about  an  increase  in  n? 
What  happens  as  φ  gets  close  to  one?  (5  points) 

7.	 Do  you  think  that  this  is  a  reasonable  model  to  explain  diﬀerences  in  growth  rates 
across  countries?  (5  points)

Now  endogenize  savings  by  introducing  a  representative  household  with  utility  function
t=0 e−ρt C (t)1−σ 
dt  where  ρ >  0,  σ >  0  and  ρ >  1−σ 
U  = 
1−φ n.  Assume  that  capital  and  labor 
1−σ 
are paid their private marginal products.  Households take their initial wealth and the paths 
of  interest  rates  and  wages  as  given,  and  choose  the  path  of  consumption  to maximize  U . 

8.  What  is  the  private marginal  product  of  capital  in  this  economy?  (5  points) 

9.  State  the  Euler  equation  and  give  an  economic  interpretation.  (5  points) 

10.	 What  are  the  growth  rates  of  K ,  A,  Y  and  C  on  the  balanced  growth  path  (don’t 
worry  about  convergence  to  the  balanced  growth  path)?  How  do  these  growth  rates 
depend  on  σ  and  ρ?  Discuss  your  results,  comparing  them  with  the  results  derived 
for  a  constant  savings  rate.  If  you  cannot  do  the  algebra,  provide  a  discussion  based 
on  your  intuition.  (10  points)
