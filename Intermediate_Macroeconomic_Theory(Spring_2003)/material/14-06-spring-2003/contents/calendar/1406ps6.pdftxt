Problem  1  (Investment  and  Saving  in  the  Decentralized  Open  Econonmy)  Consider  a 
Ramsey  economy  in which  the  utility  of  the  representative  family  is  given  by 
Z 
0 
and  population  growth  is  zero.

Families  choose  their  optimal  consumption  path  and  hence  savings,  while  the  investment

decision  in  the  decentralized  setting  is  done  by  ﬁrms.  Families  supply  labor  services 

earning  a  wage  wt ,  and  own  the  ﬁrms  receiving  proﬁts  net  of  investment  expenses,  π t  .

The  economy  diﬀers  from  the  standard  Ramsey  economy  in  two  ways.  First  we  allow  the

family  to  borrow  and  lend  freely  abroad  at  a  constant  interest  rate  ρ.  Denoting  debt  at

time  t  as  bt , the  ﬂow budget  constraint  of  the  family  is  given by


u(ct )dt 

b˙ 
t  = ρbt  + ct  − wt  − π t . 
At  time  t  the  family  pays  interest  ρbt  to  the  rest  of  the  world.  To  obtain  the  change  in

debt  (the  current  account  deﬁcit)  we  have  to  deduct  wages  and  net  proﬁt  (received  from

owning  the  ﬁrms)  from  consumption.

Second,  we  introduce  costs  to  installing  capital.  Firms  produce  f (kt )  units  of  the  con-

sumption good by investing capital and employing labor.  Firms rent labor services and for

simplicity  assume  that  labor  is  supplied  inelastically  so  that  the  labor market  equilibrium

implies that each ﬁrm hires one worker ("family").  Firms also own capital and they ﬁnance

investment through retained earnings (ﬁrms cannot rent capital anymore because of instal-
lation  costs).  The  change  in  the  capital  stock  is  now  given  by  k˙ 
t  = it .  But  the  amount  of

current  consumption³ that  has  to  be  given  up  in  order  to  obtain  it  units  of  capital  is  not

´ 
only  it  itself  but  it  1 + a k
.  Installing  an  additional  unit  of  capital  is  associated  with 
it
t 
adjustment  costs  of  T ( k
.  Notice  that  these  costs  are  increasing  in  it ,  so  installing

t 
an  additional  unit  of  capital  is  more  expensive  if  the  level  of  investment  is  high  (but  less

are a convex function
expensive if the capital stock kt  is higher).  Total adjustment costs a k

of  it .  Therefore,  a  ﬁrm’s  net  cash  ﬂow  is  π t  = f (kt ) − wt  − it  1 + a k

The  decision  problem  of  a  representative  ﬁrm  at  time  zero  is  to  choose  the  time  path  of 
investment  that maximizes  the  present  discounted  value  of  cash ﬂows:

The  inital  capital  stock  and  initial  net  foreign  assets  are  given by  k0  and  b0 ,  respectively.

1.	 Write  down  the  family’s problem.  What would  the  family want  to do  in  the  absence 
of any constraints on borrowing  from the  rest of  the world?  Write down a No-Ponzi-
Game  condition. 

2.	 Set  up  the  Hamiltonian  for  the  family.  Let  µt  be  the  co-state  variable  associated 
with  bt . Derive  the  ﬁrst  order  conditions  and  the  transversality  condition.  (Recall 
that µt  is  the  present-value multiplier,  µt  = λte−ρt , where λt  is  the  contemporaneous 
multiplier.  So  you  can  alternatively  set  up  the  problem  with  λte−ρt  as  the  co-state 
and  solve  it  in  a  similar way  to  that  done  in  class.) 

3.  Show  that  consumption  is  constant  on  the  optimal  path.  Why  is  this  the  case? 
Suppose  that  the  interest  rate  is  no  longer  equal  to  the  time  preference  rate.  What 
happens  if  r > ρ? What  happens  if  r < ρ? 

4.	 Derive  the  intertemporal  budget  constraint  of  the  family  using  its  dynamic  budget 
constraint (discounting by e−ρt  and integrating from time 0 to ∞).  Solve for ct  = c0 .

yt  < f (k∗ )  for  all  t  ≥  0  and  consequently  ct  < f (k∗ )  for  all  t  ≥  0.  Conclude  that 
b∗  = limt→∞ bt  > 0, i.e.  eventually the country runs a trade surplus to pay the interest 
on  its  debt. 

Problem  2  (Taxation)  This  problem  will  revisit  Summer’s  model  seen  in  class  and  ﬁrst 
will  ask  you  to  show  that  it  can  be  derived  from  a  q-theory  approach. 
In  the  paper, 
q  =  K .  This  is  known more  precisely  as  average  q .  Under  certain  conditions  (which will 
V
be  discussed  in  more  detail  in  recitation),  average  q  is  equal  to  marginal  q .  Now  return 
i (q − 1).  (Here,  the  notation  is  made 
to  the  equation  derived  in  class:  q˙ =  ρq − f 0 (k) −  k
comparable with that  seen  later when solving the optimization problem so I (q) =  k˙ 
i .)

2.  In  class we  saw permanent  shocks  to  taxes  on  output:  (1 − τ )f (k). 
(a)	 What  is  the  eﬀect  of  a  temporary  unanticipated  increase  in  τ  from  time  0  to 
time  t¯? Show  the  eﬀect  in  the  phase  diagram  in  (k,q)  space. 
(b)	 What  is  the  eﬀect  of  a  temporary  increase  in  τ  announced  at  time  0  to  take 
place at time  t  and  last  until  t¯ ?  Show  the  eﬀect  in  the  phase  diagram  in  (k,q) 
space. 

 

3.  Introduce  a  subsidy  of φ  per  unit  of  i  invested  by  the  ﬁrm.

(b)  Write  a  ﬁrm’s Hamiltonian  and derive  the FOCs.
