Problem 
Kaldor  (1961)  described  a  number  of  stylized  facts  about  economic  growth: 

1.  Per  capita  output  grows  over  time,  and  its  growth  rate  does  not  tend  to  diminish. 

2.  Physical  capital  per  worker  grows  over  time. 

3.  The  rate  of  return  to  capital  is  nearly  constant. 

4.  The  ratio  of  physical  capital  to  output  is  nearly  constant. 

5.  The  shares  of  labor  and  physical  capital  in  national  income  are  nearly  constant. 

6.  The  growth  rate  of  output  per  worker  diﬀers  substantially  across  countries. 

Consider  the  Solow  growth model  discussed  in  class  and  described  in Chapter  1  of Romer. 
Assume that both labor and capital are paid their marginal products.  Let w denote  ∂F (K,AL) 
∂L 
and  r  denote  ∂F (K,AL) .
∂K 
Show that the balanced growth path of this model ﬁts the stylized  facts 1.-5.  stated above, 
that  is  prove  that  along  the  balanced  growth  path: 

1.  Per  capita  output  Y  grows  at  a  positive  and  constant  rate.
L 

2.  Capital  per  worker  K  grows  at  a  positive  and  constant  rate.
L 

3.  The  rate  of  return  to  capital  r  is  constant. 

4.  The  ration  of  physical  capital  to  output  K  is  constant.

5.  The  share  of  labor  and  physical  in  national  income  Y  and  Y  are  constant.
