(due on the day of Lecture # 4) 

Problem  1  (augmented  problem  3.14  from  Romer)

Consider  the  following model  with  physical  and  human  capital:

Y (t) =  [(1 − aK )K (t)]α [(1 − aH )H (t)]1−α ,  0 < α < 1,  0 < aK  < 1,  0 < aH  < 1, 
K˙ (t) = sY (t) − δK K (t), 
H˙ (t) = B [aK K (t)]γ [aH H (t)]φ [A(t)L(t)]1−γ−φ  − δH H (t),  γ > 0,  φ > 0,
L˙ (t) = nL(t), 
A˙ (t) = gA(t), 

γ + φ < 1, 

where  aK  and  aH  are  the  fractions  of  the  stocks  of  physical  and  human  capital  used  in  the 

education  sector.

This model assumes  that human capital  is produced  in  its own  sector with  its own produc­

tion  function.  Bodies (L) are useful only as something to be educated, not as an  input  into

the  production  of  ﬁnal  goods.  Similarly,  knowledge  (A)  is  useful  only  as  something  that

can  be  conveyed  to  students,  not  as  a  direct  input  to  goods  production.

1.  Deﬁne  k =  K  and  h =  AL .  Derive  equations  for  k˙  and  h˙ .
H
AL 
2.  Find  an  equation  describing  the  set  of  combinations  of  h  and  k  such  that  h˙  = 0. 

3.	 Diﬀerentiate  the  h˙  = 0  equation  with  respect  to  k  and  h  to  ﬁnd  the  slope  dk 
dh . 
dh2  to  ﬁnd  the  curvature  of  the  h˙  =  0  locus.  Sketch  the  locus  in  (h, k) 
4.  Calculate  d2 k 
space. 

5.	 What are signs of h˙  above and below the h˙  = 0  locus?  Add the corresponding arrows 
to  your  diagram. 

6.  Repeat  steps  2.-5.  for  the  k˙  = 0  equation  to  complete  the  phase  diagram. 

7.	 Does  this  economy  have  a  balanced  growth  path?  If  so,  is  it  unique?  Is  it  stable? 
What  are  the  growth  rates  of  output  per  person,  physical  capital  per  person,  and 
human  capital  per  person  on  the  balanced  growth  path? 

8.	 Suppose  the  economy  is  initially  on  a  balanced  growth  path,  and  that  there  is  a 
permanent  increase  in s.  Sketch how the economy moves to the new balanced growth 
path  in  your  phase  diagram.  How  does  this  change  aﬀect  the  path  of  output  per 
person  over  time?  Repeat  this  analyis  for  a  permanent  increase  in  n. 

Problem  2  (problem  3.17  from  the  ﬁrst  edition  of  Romer’s  textbook)

Suppose  the  production  function  is  Y (t) = K (t)αH (t)1−α  where  0 < α < 1.  Notice  that  it

exhibits  constant  returns  to  physical  and  human  capital  together.  Physical  capital K  and

human  capital H  evolve  according  to K˙ (t) = sK Y (t)  and H˙ (t) = sH Y (t).

�	 �∗K
1.  Show  that  regardless  of  the  initial  levels  of  K  and  H  (as  long  as  both  are  positive),
� �∗K
the  ratio  K  converges  to  some  balanced-growth-path  level  H 
.
H 
2.  Once  K  has  converged  to  H 
,  what  are  the  growth  rates  of K , H  and  Y ?
H 
3.	 How,  if  at  all,  does  the  growth  rate  of  Y  on  the  balanced  growth  path  depend  on  sK 
� �∗K
and  sH ? 
4.  Suppose  K  starts  oﬀ  at  a  level  that  is  smaller  that  H 
.  Is  the  initial  growth  rate  of
H 
Y  greater  than,  less  than,  or  equal  to  its  growth  rate  on  the  balanced  growth  path? 

Problem  3 
Consider  the model  of Mankiw, Romer  and Weil  (1992)  presented  in  class.  What  values  of 
sK  and sH  maximize consumption per unit of eﬀective  labor on  the balanced growth path?
