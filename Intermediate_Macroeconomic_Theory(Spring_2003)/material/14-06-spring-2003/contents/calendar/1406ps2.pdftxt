Problem  Poverty Traps in the Solow Model 

Suppose the production function takes the form:

y    fk    k  
if k    1 
and

y    fk    k  
if k    1,

where     1.  Otherwise continue to assume the standard Solow model.

Specifically, assume there is no technological progress, g    0.  Also assume that

s    n      s. 

1.	 Comment on the form of the production function.  First, what general aggregate 
production function (Y    FK, L) does it derive from? Second, what economic effects 
could give rise to the specific form of the production function given above? 
2.	 Show that there exist two steady states (both analytically and graphically).  Study their 
stability properties.  Under which condition might the economy eventually end up in the 
low k steady state? Explain the intuition. 
3.	 Does this model have implications for the question of convergence? That is, whether 
countries are converging to similar per capita income? 
4.	 Suppose that the economy is in the low k steady state.  Could a donation from an 
international aid agency help the country out of its “poverty trap”? If so, what is the 
minimum donation required? 
5.	 Could a change in the savings rate, s,  lift the economy out of its poverty trap without 
outside assistance?  If yes, characterize the minimum change in the savings rate needed 
and whether it will have to be permanent.  If no, explain why not. 

Problem  Augmented Problem (1.10) from Romer 

Suppose that capital and labor are paid their marginal products.  (That is, 
w    FK, AL/L and r    FK, AL/K  , and assume the standard Solow properties for F) 
In addition, suppose that all capital income is saved and all labor income is consumed.  Thus 
K   FK, AL/K K  K. 

1.	 Show that this economy converges to a balanced growth path. Show this graphically as 
well by plotting f  k against k. 
2.	 Is k on the balanced growth path greater than, less than, or equal to the golden-rule level of 
k? What is the intuition for this result? 
3.	 Suppose the production function takes the Cobb-Douglas form, FK, AL    K  AL 1 . 
Derive the equation describing the dynamics of k    K/AL, that is, the k  equation. 
Compare it to the standard Solow model where S    sY.  What is the savings rate 
associated with our Cobb-Douglas production function where we assume that capital 

income is saved? 
4.	 Assume for simplicity that there is no depreciation, that is     0 and return to a general 
form of the production function.  Suppose the government decides to tax a farction t 
(constant) of capital income.  The government then consumes the full amount of this 
revenue.  For example, it digs holes in the ground, or eats more caviar, or (insert your 
favorite government wasteful consumption choice).  Derive the equation for k  in this case. 
How does steady state k compare to before? 
5.	 Now suppose that the government decides to save all the revenue it acquires from taxing 
capital income. Derive the equation for k  in this case. How does steady state k compare to 
before? 

Problem  Empirical Exercise on Convergence 

This excercise is to familiarize yourself with some of the datasets and empirical techniques 
used in the growth literature.  You are asked to reproduce a scatter plot similar to that in your 
textbook (Figure 1.7). 

	 Go to the Penn World Tables database website 
(http://www.bized.ac.uk/dataserv/penndata/penn.htm).  You will obtain a data request 
form from which you can select which series, years and countries you would like.  Choose 
the series “Real per capita GDP in current prices” f or the years 1960-1998 f or t he 15 
countries in Figure 1.7: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, 
Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United 
States. (omit Germany because data is not available in the earlier years). 
	 Take the log of real per capita GDP in 1960.  Then take the difference of this log series 
between 1998 and 1960.  This latter variable will be a measure of the growth of per capita 
real income in a given country over the 38 years. 
1.	 Plot the growth rate against per capita real GDP in 1960 for the 15 countries.  Do the 
results confirm the evidence for convergence? 
2.	 Repeat the exercise in 1. for a few more countries of your choice (include a range of 
developing countries from Latin America, Africa, Asia).  Do the results support those 
found above?  Can the evidence be reconciled with the Solow model?
