***** Course Overview *****
This course is a communications intensive subject, and there are two papers
required. These will count for total of 35% of the grade. The first paper will
be an essay of 5 pages. It should draw on the tools of macroeconomics
(including models, equations, and graphs) you acquired in 14.02. The topic will
be based on current events. The first paper will be worth 10% of the final
grade. The deadline is by lecture no. 3. The second paper will be an essay of
about 15 pages. The topic is described later in the course outline. A rough
draft or an outline of the second paper is due by lecture no. 8. Credit will be
given for both the outline (10% of the final grade) and the paper (15% of the
final grade). The final version of the second paper is due by lecture no. 9.
More details about the paper can be found at the end of the syllabus. Problem
sets will count for 20% of the final grade. There will also be a midterm and
final examination. The midterm will count for 15% of the grade and the final
for 30% of the grade.
The text for the course is David Romer, Advanced Macroeconomics, Second Edition
(New York: McGraw Hill, 2001). The detailed course outline lists other
readings, which will include journal articles and selections from other books.
A few other resources for the paper are listed at the end of the syllabus.

***** The First Paper for 14.06 *****
This paper should be a paper that uses the tools of 14.02 to analyze a current
public policy issue. It should be about 5 pages long, double-spaced (on
numbered pages), with a bibliography of works consulted. It should demonstrate
an understanding of concepts and models from 14.02 and an ability to apply
these to an issue in the real world. Knowledge of the models should be
demonstrated by a use of written analysis closely based on a model, graphs,
and/or equations. The topic of the paper is: why did Japan's economy slump in
the early 1990s and why is Japan in a recession today? (If you wish to write on
a different topic, you must receive written permission from your TA.)
***** The Second Paper for 14.06 *****
This paper should be a research paper that is about 15 pages long, double-
spaced (on numbered pages), with a bibliography of works consulted. It should
demonstrate both your understanding of the subject and your ability to write in
English. An outline (or, even better, a rough draft) is due by lecture no. 8.
The outline also will be the basis on which you can get feedback from a TA for
the final version. Credit will be given for both the outline (10% of the final
grade) and the paper (15% of the final grade).
You should bring your outline with you when you discuss your paper with a TA. A
first draft of the paper also should be written soon after lecture no. 8, if a
second draft is to be turned in by lecture no. 9. Late papers will be penalized
on a steep sliding scale that makes it worth your while to submit the paper on
time rather than trying to wait a week to improve it.
The paper should be a comparison of economic conditions in two countries. One
country could be the country you live in, or from which your parents came, or
with which you have other strong attachments. The other country should be
chosen to provide a good contrast with this one. Feel free to discuss the
choice of country with your instructors. You can describe and analyze economic
growth in the two countries in the last half of the 20th century. The aim of
the paper should be to use the theories learned in 14.06 to explain the
qualitative and quantitative performance of the two countries. Comparing and
contrasting two countries should provide enough movements of interest for our
theories to explain.
Like any good paper, this one should have a beginning, a middle, and an end.
The beginning should state clearly the topic of the paper and what you are
planning to do. It should be rewritten after the rest of the paper is finished
to make sure it fits the paper as written and presents a good case for someone
to read the paper. In particular, the beginning should explain what theories
you are employing in your analysis. The middle of the paper should contain your
description of qualitative and quantitative performance of the two countries
and your analysis of them. This part can contain diagrams and data as needed to
show what you are explaining or how you are explaining it. It is the longest
and most substantial part of the paper. The end of the paper should summarize
your argument, state your conclusions, and draw any implications of your
analysis that you think warranted.
Plagiarism is a major problem when writing research papers under time pressure.
You should avoid plagiarism at all costs. If you are in doubt about whether you
are over the line of acceptable behavior, you are too close to the edge. Omit
the questionable passage and draw back from the edge. Provide full citations
for all sources you consult in your work. Feel free to quote from them, but
indicate clearly when you are quoting.
The following two books may be useful in addition to the material on the
syllabus.
Chang, Ha-Joon. Kicking Away the Ladder-Development Strategy in Historical
Perspective. London: Anthem Press, 2002.

Misadventures in the Tropics. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2001.

***** Paper Standards for 14.05 *****
Here are ten questions to pose of each paper. The answers can be scored on,
say, a five-point scale. The addition of these scores will yield an overall
score on a base of 50. If you prefer, a narrower or wider score could be used
for each question; the aim is to record information without forcing paper
graders into meaningless discriminations. My hope is that almost all papers
will score high in the first five questions; the discrimination between papers
will come in questions 6 through 10.
   1. Does the paper look like a proper paper (Title, 20 pp., bibliography,
      etc.)?
   2. Is it in English (as opposed to literal translation of foreign phrases)?
   3. Does the paper have a beginning, middle and an end?
   4. Does the paper use the Solow model reasonably (not necessarily totally
      correctly)?
   5. Does the paper use other growth theory reasonably (not necessarily
      totally correctly)?
   6. Are there relevant quantitative data in the paper?
   7. Is there a clear comparison between two countries?
   8. Do the details in the paper advance the argument (as opposed to filling
      space)?
   9. Does the argument flow and/or cumulate as the paper continues?
  10. Is the paper persuasive?
