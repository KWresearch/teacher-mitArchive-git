Final  Exam  Solutions 

Part  A  (True,  false  or  uncertain) 

1.	 Because more capital al lows more output to be produced,  it is always better for a coun-
try  to  have  more  capital  stock. 
False. A per  capita  capital  stock  above  the  golden  rule  level  is  so  costly  to maintain 
due to depreciation and population growth that reducing the capital  stock would ac-
tually make it possible to increase consumption in all future periods. The golden rule 
level  is  associated  with  the  steady  state  that  maximizes  steady-state  consumption. 
Remember  that  agents  in  the  economy  want  to  maximize  their  (discounted)  utility 
which  depends  on  consumption,  not  on maximizing  the  capital  stock. 

2.	 A market  economy  wil l  generate  the  optimal  growth  rate. 
Uncertain.  In  many  models  of  endogenous  growth,  ﬁrms  do  not  take  into  account 
how their accumulation of capital contributes to the accumulation of knowledge. Due 
to  this  externality  the  growth  rate  is  below  its  socially  optimal  level. Recall  that 
we  found  that  the  social marginal  product  of  capital  exceeded  that  private marginal 
product of capital in these models. However in cases of perfect competition, constant 
returns  to  scale  and  no  market  imperfections  and  externalities,  then  the  decentral-
ized  (market) optimum will be  identical  to  the centralized  (social planner) optimum. 
These  are  the  cases  we  saw  in  class  for  the  Ramsey  model  and  its  extensions  to 
investment  in  an  open  economy. 

3.	 Critics  of  the  Bush Administration’s  tax  cut  are  wrong  when  they  say  that  increasing 
the  budget  deﬁcit  wil l  reduce  national  savings. 
Uncertain.  If Ricardian equivalence holds, then households will realize that taxes will 
have  to  be  increased  in  the  future  and  thus  they  will  not  change  their  consumption 
path  and  will  simply  save  the  tax  cut. Recall  that  Ricardian  equivalence  is  if, 
for  example,  the  government  cuts  taxes  without  changing  its  path  for  government 
spending then this will have no eﬀect on consumption because the present discounted 
value  of  taxation  has  not  changed  if  government  spending  has  not.  National  savings 
(equal to sum of public and private savings) would be unaﬀected by the tax cut.  But 
if  households  are  liquidity  constrained  (or  if  there  are  other  imperfections  that  were 
not discussed in class such as ﬁnite horizons, myopia etc),  they will spend part of the 
tax  cut,  so  national  savings will  fall. 

(If  your  answer  was  along  the  lines  above,  that  was  suﬃcient  for  full  credit  on  this 
question but here are some additional implications...  The above discussion abstracted 
from  investment  decisions,  but  now  suppose  that  the  tax  cut  implies  an  increase  in 
after  tax  income  for  ﬁrms.  In  the  q-theory,  this  implies  that  steady  state  capital 
increases  and along  the  transition  investment  is positive. Net output,  (1 − τ )f (k) − 
i(1 + T (i/k)),  may  either  increase  or  decrease  initially  depending  on  whether  the 
increase  in  output  is  larger  or  smaller  than  the  increase  in  investment.  In  the  long 
run,  it  increases.  Consumption  is  determined  by  a  constant  share  (the  rate  of  time 
preference) of the PDV of net output, so it increases relative to before the tax cut (to 
the  level  at  which  the  sum  of  the  area  between  it  and  net  output  over  time  is  equal 
to zero).  If net output is initially below the increase in consumption,  then consumers 
will be borrowing in anticipation of higher net output later.  Private savings are equal 
to  (1 − τ )f (k)− PDV net  output,  and may also  fall  initially,  so national  savings will 
fall  initially.  But  in  general  there  is  no  simple  relation because  private  savings  could 
increase  initially  and  the  eﬀect  on  national  savings would be  ambiguous.) 

4.	 If  the  federal  government  introduced an  investment  tax credit  (a policy  that  eﬀectively 
reduces  the  price  of  capital  goods)  immediately  and  kept  it  in  place  until  the  end  of 
the  year,  the  stock  market  would  tend  to  rise  between  now  and  the  end  of  the  year, 
and  there  would  be  a  long  run  increase  in  productive  capacity. 
False.  This  can be  analyzed  in a q-theory approach, where q approximates  the  stock 
market.  The  eﬀect on  the  stock market at impact is ambiguous,  but  what  is  unam-
biguous  is  that  we  are  still  above  the  steady  state  associated  with  the  investment 
tax  credit.  So  while  the  investment  tax  credit  is  in  place  the  stock  market  will  be 
falling  over  time  as more  and more  capital  is  installed.  The  intuition  is  that because 
investment  increases  initially,  the  industry’s  proﬁts  (aside  from  the  tax  credit)  will 
be  lower and thus  the existing capital  is  less valuable.  At  the end of  the year  the  tax 
credit  is  removed  and  the  economy  will  gradually  return  to  its  old  steady  state,  so 
there is no long-run  increase in productive  capacity. 

(The  speciﬁcs  of  what  is  happening  is  discussed  in  the  Summers  paper,  Figure  3. 
Summers  considers  a  permanent  increase  in  the  investment  tax  credit  but  the  logic 
extends  to  the  case  of  a  temporary  increase.  If  there  is  an  investment  tax  credit, 
then  in  the(q , k)  space,  k˙  = 0  shifts  down  to  the  new  steady  state  value  of  cost  of 
investment  q  = 1 − φ  (where  φ  is  the  tax  credit  per  unit  of  investment).  But  if  the 
∗
capital  stock  enters  the  adjustment  cost  function,  T (i/k),  then  the  q˙ = 0  curve  will 
shift  to  the  right.  The  initial  impact  on  q  could  either  be  an  increase  or  a  decrease 
depending  on  the  saddle  paths.  In  Summers,  he  draws  a  particular  saddle  path  so 
that the initial impact is an increase but he notes that if the saddle paths were ﬂatter, 
the  intial  eﬀect  could  be  a  fall.  In  contrast,  as  in  Romer  chapter  8,  if  adjustment 

 

costs  only  depend  on  investment,  T (i),  then  the  q˙ = 0  curve  does  not  shift  and 
there  is  an  unambiguous  fall  in  q  at  time  of  announcement  of  tax  credit. However, 
whether  initial  q  rises  or  falls,  it  will  still  be  above  new  q  and  will  therefore  fall  in 
∗
the  transition. But  then  because  it  is  temporary, will  return  to  old  equilibrium  and 
the  stock market will  increase  along  the  transition.) 

5.	 In  a  smal l,  open  economy  like Venezuela,  a  temporary negative  shock  (such as  a  tem-
porary  drop  in  the  price  of  oil) wil l  have  a  bigger  eﬀect  on  consumption  and  long-run 
interest  payments  to  foreigners  than  a  permanent  shock. 
False.  A  temporary  shock  reduces wealth  less  than  a  permanent  shock,  so  consump-
tion will  fall  less  (remember  PDV  of  consumption  equals  PDV  of  wealth).  However, 
in  response  to  a  temporary  shock  the  economy  will  borrow  to  smooth  consumption, 
so long run interest payments to foreigners will be higher.  In response to a permanent 
shock  there  is  no  point  in  borrowing,  so  long-run  interest  payments  do  not  change. 
So  the  statement  is  correct  with  respect  to  long-run  interest  payments  but  not  wrt 
consumption. 



Part  B 

1.  Because  β  = (1 − α), the  ﬁrm  exhibits  constant  returns  to  scale.  The  ﬁrm  chooses 
factor  inputs Kt  and Lt  to maximize  proﬁts  at  each date  t 

α(AtLt )β  − wtLt  − (rt  + δ)Kt 
Kt
where  δ  is  the rate of  depreciation.  The  ﬁrm  increases  its  demand  for  a  factor  until 
the marginal  product  equals  the  factor  price, which  yields  the  ﬁrst  order  conditions

(a)  The  household’s  ﬂow budget  constraint will  be:

(b)  If  the  household  works  one  more  unit  today,  the  associated  disutility  is  1−lt

Consuming  the  additional  labor  income  generates  utility  wt .  Along  an  optimal

4.	 The  following  discussion  is  valid  for  the  baseline  parameter  values  in  section  4.7  of 
Romer (2001).  According to these baseline parameters the shock to A will eventually 
die  out  as  ρA  < 1.

Output  will  increase  on  impact  and  then  gradually  return  to  normal.  The  initial 
increase  is  partly  due  to  the  direct  eﬀect  of  higher  productivity  and  partly  due 
to an increase in employment (the initial capital stock is given).  Over time both 
employment and productivity decline, which tends to reduce output.  The capital 
stock  will  grow  temporarily,  but  not  enough  to  oﬀset  the  two  other  forces,  so 
over  time  output will  fall. 
Labor  Supply  Due  to  the  wealth  eﬀect  consumption  will  be  higher  than  normal 
during  the  transition  but  gradually  return  to  normal.  From  the  labor  supply 
equation  we  see  that  the  labor  supply  schedule  will  shift  to  the  left  on  impact 
and gradually return to its initial position.  (wage on y-axis and labor on x-axis) 
Labor  Demand  On  impact  the  labor  demand  schedule  shifts  to  the  right  due  to 
higher  productivity.  The  temporary  increase  in  the  capital  stock  will  also  shift 
the  schedule  outward,  but  eventually  it  will  return  to  normal  (wage  on  y-axis 
and  labor  on  x-axis). 
Wage  Rate  As labor supply shifts to the left while labor demand shifts to the right, 
the wage must increase.  It increases on impact, then increases for a few quarters 
before  it  gradually  returns  to  normal. 
Employment  The  outward  shift  in  labor  demand  is  stronger  today  that  it  will  be 
in  the  not  to  distant  future.  Thus  working  is  more  attractive  today  than  it 
is  tomorrow.  This  motive  for  intertemporal  substitution  is  stronger  than  the 
wealth  eﬀect,  so  employment  will  increase  on  impact.  But  it  will  actually  fall 
below normal  before  gradually  returning  to  its  normal  level. 
Interest  Rate  On  impact  the interest rate increases  due  to  higher  productivity. 
Over  time  the  shock  to  productivity  will  die  out  while  temporarily  the  capital 
stock  is  growing.  As  a  consequence  the  interest  rate  falls  below  normal  before 
returning  to  its  normal  level. 

 

Consumption  Consumption  increases  on  impact  due  to  the  wealth  eﬀect.  The 
high  interest  rate  together  with  the  Euler  equation  implies  that  for  a  while 
consumption will be growing.  But eventually the interest rate falls below normal 
and  consumption will  be  falling  and  gradually  return  to  normal. 
Savings  The gain from higher productivity will be smoothed over time.  First savings 
will  be  higher  than  normal,  but  eventually  the  household will  dissave. 
Physical  Capital  Physical  capital  is  given  and  cannot  change  on  impact  (from  2a 
it  depends  on  t-1  variables).  From  the  discussion  of  savings  it  follows  that 
physical  capital  will  be  increasing  for  a  while,  but  eventually  it  will  peak  and 
then  gradually  return  to  normal. 

5.	

(a)  The capital share and labor share  in income could be used to calibrate α and β . 
But  remember we  are  assuming  that  α = 1 − β  and  for  this  to  be  valid,  factors 
must be paid their marginal products.  This condition can fail for various reasons 
such  as  imperfect  competition,  externalities,  labor  hoarding  etc. 

(b)	 The  calibration  suggested  in  part  (a)  is  only  valid  under  CRS,  so  it  fails  if 
α + β >  1.  This  would  imply  that  the  Solow  residuals  no  longer  just  capture 
technology  shocks.  A  high  Solow  residual  may  simply  be  a  consequence  of  a 
high  level  of  production  in  combination with  increasing  returns  to  a  factor.
