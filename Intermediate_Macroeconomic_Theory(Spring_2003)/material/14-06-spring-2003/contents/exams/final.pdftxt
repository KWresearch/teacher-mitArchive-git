14.06 Macroeconomics 
Spring  2003 

Final  Exam 

Instructions:  You have 3 hours to complete the exam.  Please be concise and write legibly. 
There  are  two  parts,  each  worth  50  points.  Answer  all  questions  in  both  parts,  using  a 
separate  bluebook  for  each  part. 

Part  A  (True,  false  or  uncertain)

Say whether  the  following  statements  are  true,  false  or  uncertain.  Justify  your  answer  in  a

couple  of  paragraphs  (10  points  per  statement).


1.  Because  more  capital  allows  more  output  to  be  produced,  it  is  always  better  for  a 
country  to  have more  capital  stock. 

2.  A market  economy  will  generate  the  optimal  growth  rate. 

3.  Critics of the Bush Administration’s tax cut are wrong when they say that increasing 
the  budget  deﬁcit  will  reduce  national  saving. 

4.	 If the federal government introduced an investment tax credit (a policy that eﬀectively 
reduces  the  price  of  capital  goods)  immediately  and  kept  it  in  place  until  the  end  of 
the year, the stock market would tend to rise between now and the end of the year,and 
there  would  be  a  long-run  increase  in  productive  capacity. 

5.	 In  a  small,  open  economy  like  Venezuela,  a  temporary  negative  shock  (such  as  a 
temporary  drop  in  the  price  of  oil)  will  have  a  bigger  eﬀect  on  consumption  and 
long-run  interest  payments  to  foreigners  than  a  permanent  shock. 

Part  B  (Real  Business  Cycles) 

Suppose  there  are many  ﬁrms  in  the  economy,  all  with  the  following  production  function:


α (AtLt )β 
Yt  = Kt

where  Yt  is  output,  Kt  is  physical  capital  stock,  Lt  is  employment,  and  α  and  β  are  pa­
rameters,  with  α + β  =  1.  At  represents  the  state  of  technology  and  follows  a  stochastic 
process.  There  is only one asset  in the economy, physical capital.  Physical capital  is owned 
by  households  and  rented  to  ﬁrms.  It  depreciates  at  rate  δ  .  Throughout  the  problem, 
assume  that  this  is  a  closed  economy  with  no  government  sector  (for  simplicity). 

1.	 Set  up  the  typical  ﬁrm’s  problem,  ﬁnd  the  ﬁrst-order  conditions,  and  provide  an 
economic  interpretation.  (10  points) 

For  simplicity,  suppose  households  live  forever,  have  a  rate  of  time  preference  of  ρ  ,  and 
have  the  following  instantaneous  utility  function: 
u(ct , 1 − lt ) =  ln ct  + b ln(1 − lt ) 

where  ct  is  the  household’s  consumption,  lt  is  the  household’s  labor  supply,  and  b  is  a 
parameter,  b > 0. 

2.  Set  up  the  typical  household’s  intertemporal  optimization  problem  including, 

(a)	 The  household’s  ﬂow  budget  constraint  (linking  labor  income  wt lt ,  capital  in-
come  rtkt ,  consumption  ct ,  today’s  capital  kt  and  tomorrow’s  capital  kt+1 ). 
(3  points) 

(b)	 Provide  a  derivation  of  the  intratemporal  ﬁrst-order  condition  relating  contem­
poraneous  consumption  and  labor  supply.  Give  an  economic  interpretation. 
(3  points) 

(c)	 Provide  a  derivation  of  the  intertemporal  ﬁrst-order  condition  linking  current 
consumption  and  consumption  in  the  next  period,  i.e.  the  Euler  equation  (re-
member  that  there  is  uncertainty).  Give  an  economic  interpretation.  (4  points) 

3.	 Find  the  equations  that  describe  labor  supply  and  demand.  For  simplicity,  you may 
work  through  the  problem  as  if  there  were  a  single  representative  ﬁrm  and  a  single 
representative  household.  (5  points) 

4.	 Suppose  that  shocks  to A  are positively  serially  correlated.  Use  a  combination  of  the 
ﬁrm’s  and  household’s  optimality  conditions  and  economic  intuition  to  explain  the 
eﬀects on output,  labor  supply and demand,  the wage  rate,  employment,  the  interest 
rate,  consumption,  savings,  and  the  physical  capital  stock  of  a  one-time  shock  that 
increases  A.  Where  possible,  explain  the  eﬀect  both  in  the  initial  period  and  later. 
(15  points) 

5.	

(a)  How  could  you  calibrate  α  and  β ?  What  conditions  would  be  required  for  this 
calibration  to  be  valid?  (5  points) 

(b)	 Suppose  α + β >  1.  Would  the  calibration  you  described  in  (a)  still  be  valid? 
If  α + β >  1,  how  would  this  aﬀect  the  interpretation  of  Solow  residuals  as 
technology  shocks?  (5  points)
