Midterm  Exam  Solutions 

Part  A  (True,  false  or  uncertain) 

1.	 An  economy  that  increases  its  saving  rate  wil l  experience  faster  growth. 
Uncertain.  In  the  Solow  model  an  economy  that  increases  its  saving  rate  will  tem­
porarily  experience  faster  growth,  but  the  long-run  growth  rate  remains  unchanged. 
In endogenous growth models the long-run growth rate may be an increasing function 
of  the  saving  rate.  An  example  for  this  is  the  AK  model. 

2.	 Once  human  capital  is  included,  the  Solow  model  does  a  good  job  at  explaining  ob­
served  per  capita  income  diﬀerences  across  countries. 
Uncertain.  Introducing  human  capital  has  the  potential  to  greatly  increase  the  abil­
ity  of  the  Solow model  to  account  for  cross-country  diﬀerences  in  per  capita  income. 
To  see  that,  recall  that  in  class  we  derived  that  in  the  Solow  model,  the  long  run 
α
elasticity  of  output with  respect  to  the  saving  rate  is  1−α , where  α  is  capital’s  share. 
If capital’s  share  is moderate,  this elasticity  is not  large.  So diﬀerences  in  the  savings 
rate across countries do not translate into large diﬀerences in per capita income across 
countries.  But  if  capital’s  share  is  close  to  one,  a  small  increase  in  s  causes  a  large 
increase  in  per  capital  output.  Recognizing  the  existence  of  human  capital  implies 
that  we  must  raise  our  estimate  of  the  share  of  income  that  is  paid  to  capital  (the 
usual  estimate  we  used  was  one  third),  and  this  larger  captial’s  share may  enable  us 
to  explain  large  diﬀerences  in  per  capita  income  across  countries. 
However,  according  to  empirical  studies  by  Hall  and  Jones  (1999)  and  Klenow  and 
Rodriguez-Clare  (1997),  variations  in both physical and human  capital are of of non­
neglibile  imporatance,  but  variations  in  output  for  given  capital  stocks  are  the  most 
important source of income diﬀerences across countries (see Romer, Part B of Chapter 
3). 

3.	 Growth  theory predicts  that poor countries  should grow  faster  than  rich countries,  and 
researchers  have  found  the  evidence  to  be  consistent  with  this  prediction. 
The  hypothesis  that  poor  economies  tend  to  grow  faster  per  capita  than  rich  ones 
–  without  conditioning  on  any  other  characteristics  of  economies  –  is  referred  to 
as  abolute  convergence.  Does  the  Solow  model  predict  absolut  convergence?  If  all 
countries  have  the  same  parameters  (technology,  saving  rate,  etc.)  then  they  all 
have  the  same  balanced  growth  path  and  only  diﬀer  by  how  far  they  are  away  from 

the  balanced  growth  path,  and  indeed  the model would  predict  absolut  convergence. 
If  countries  have  diﬀer  in  technology,  savings  rate  etc.,  then  the  model  does  not 
necessarily predict absolut convergence.  But one may still expect absolut convergence 
to  occur.  If  only  saving  rates  diﬀer,  then  countries  with  low  capital  per  worker  due 
to  a  low  savings  rate  will  have  a  higher  marginal  product  of  capital,  which  provides 
incentives  of  capital  to  ﬂow  from  rich  to  poor  countries.  If  diﬀerences  in  per  capita 
income are due to diﬀerences in technology, one may expect these diﬀerences to shrink 
as  poorer  countries  gain  access  to  state-of-the  art methods. 
Is  the  evidence  consistent with  absolut  convergence?  In  class we  discussed  the  study 
of  Baumol  (1986),  and  his  results  provided  strong  support  for  absolut  convergence. 
However,  De  Long  (1988)  demonstrates  that  Baumol’s  ﬁndings  are  largely  spurious 
due  to problems of  sample  selection and measurement  error  (see Romer,  section 1.7). 

4.	 A Ramsey  economy  that  starts  above  the  golden  rule  capital  stock  wil l  converge  to  the 
golden  rule.  But  if  it  starts  below  the  golden  rule  it  wil l  also  converge  to  a  level  below 
the  golden  rule  because  impatient  consumers  are  unwil ling  to  sacriﬁce  consumption 
during  the  transition. 
False.  The economy will converge to the modiﬁed golden rule capital stock irrespective 
of  whether  the  initial  stock  is  below  or  above  the  golden  rule  capital  stock.  Recall 
the  Euler  equation  of  the  Ramsey model: 
ct  = σ(ct )[f � (kt ) − θ − n] 
˙
ct 
Only the modiﬁed golden rule level k∗  implicitly deﬁned by f � (k∗ ) = n+ θ is consistent 
with  zero  consumption  growth.  If  f � (kt )  > θ + n,  then  consuming  the  same  today 
and  tomorrow  is  not  optimal  because  then  the  the  marginal  rate  of  transformation 
would  exceed  the  marginal  rate  of  substitution  and  the  representative  family  could 
increase utility by  increasing  consumption  tomorrow  relative  to  today.  An  analogous 
argument  applies  to  the  case  f � (kt ) < θ + n. 



Part  B 

1.	 This speciﬁcation can be interpreted as a learning-by-doing model in which knowledge 
accumulation occurs as a side eﬀect of goods production.The idea of learning-by-doing 
is  that,  as  individuals  produce  goods,  they  inevitably  think  of ways  of  improving  the 
production  process.  For  example,  Arrow  (1962)  cites  the  empirical  regularity  that 
after  a  new  airplane  design  is  introduced,  the  time  required  to  build  the  marginal 
aircraft  is  decreasing  in  the  number  of  aircraft  of  that model  that  have  already  been 
produced.  In  contrast  to R&D  activities,  this  type  of  knowledge  accumulation  is  not 
a  result  of  deliberate  eﬀorts,  but  a  side  eﬀect  of  conventional  economic  activity.  (see 
Romer,  page  120) 

2.  This  question  turned  out  to  be  an  unintended  trick  question.  If  the  speciﬁcation 
had  been  A(t) =  Y (t)φ ,  then  φ  =  0  would  have  implied  A(t)  =  1  for  all  t,  and 
the  model  would  have  reduced  to  the  Solow  model  without  exogenous  technological 
progress.  We  added  this  question  after  writing  and  solving  the  problem,  thinking 
that  it  would  give  you  the  opportunity  to  get  some  points  without  a  lot  of  algebra, 
and  we  thought  φ  =  0  was  the  answer.  But  with  the  speciﬁcation  A˙ (t) =  Y (t)φ , 
A˙ (t)
φ = 0  implies A˙ (t) = 1  for  all  t,  and  so A(t) = A(0) + t  and  gA (t) =  A(t)  =  A(0)+t .  So 
1
there is always some technological progress, but this technological progress eventually 
becomes  negligible.  So  in  the  long  run  the  economy will  look  very  similar  to  a  Solow 
economy  without  technological  progress,  but  the  equations  governing  the  economy 
are  not  identical. 

3.	 There was a typo in the question which was corrected during the exam.  The question 
should  have  read  “Find  expressions  for  gA (t)  and  gK (t)  in  terms  of  A(t),  K (t),  L(t) 
and  the  parameters.”,  and  the  answer  is 
A(t)�
�1−α
Y (t)φ 
= K (t)φαA(t)φ(1−α)−1L(t)φ(1−α) ,
A(t)L(t) 
gK (t) = s
K (t) 

gA (t) = 

. 

4.  Diﬀerentiation  yields 

g˙A (t) 
gA (t) 
g˙K (t) 
gK (t) 

= φαgK (t) + (φ(1 − α) − 1)gA (t) + φ(1 − α)n, 
= (1 − α)(gA (t) + n − gK (t)). 

You  can  get  this  answer  very  quickly  by  using  the  following  rules: 

 

(a)  If X (t),  Y (t)  and  Z (t)  are  functions  of  time  and  Z (t) = X (t) · Y (t),  then 

Z˙ (t)  X˙ (t) 
=
Z (t)  X (t) 

+ 

Y˙ (t) 
. 
Y (t) 

(b)  If X (t)  and  Y (t)  are  functions  of  time  and  Y (t) = X (t)α ,  then 

Y˙ (t) 
Y (t) 

= α

X˙ (t) 
. 
X (t) 

You  should  have  been  aware  of  these  rules  from  problem  sets  and  recitation,  but

for  some  reason  most  of  you  did  not  apply  them,  and  thus  wasted  precious  time  on

tedious  algebra.

What  is  important  here  is  that  the  right  hand  side  of  the  resulting  equations  depend

on  time  only  through  gK (t)  and  gA (t),  i.e.  K (t),  A(t)  and  L(t)  no  longer  appear  in

these  equations.  If  this  were  not  the  case,  it  would  not  be  possible  to  draw  a  phase 

diagram.

The  g˙ A  = 0  and  g˙K  = 0  schedules  are  given  by

5.	 As  is clear from the phase diagram the economy converges to a balanced growth path 
∗ 
∗
on which A grows at rate gA  and both K  and Y  grow at rate gK .  The balanced growth 
path  essentially  looks  like  the  balanced  growth  path  of  the  Solow model,  but  instead 
of  exogenous  technological  progress  at  rate  g  we  now  have  technological  progress  at 
∗ 
φ 
an  endogenously  determined  rate  gA  =  1−φ n. 

6.	 What  we  are  usually  interested  in  is  the  growth  rate  of  per  capita  output.  Here 
Y
the  growth  rate  of  output  per  capita  L  on  the  balanced  growth  pathis  given  by 
∗
∗ 
φ 
g Y  = gA  =  1−φ n.  An  increase  in  s  has  no  eﬀect  on  long  run  per  capita  growht  while 
L 
an  increase  in  n  will  increase  long  run  per  capita  growth.  The  long  run  growth  rate 
goes  to  inﬁnity  as  φ  gets  close  to  one. 

7.	 The growth rate of output per capita  is not on average higher  in countries with faster 
population  growth,  so  this  is  not  a  good  model  to  account  for  diﬀerences  in  growth 
rates  across  countries.

8.	 The  private  marginal  product  of  capital  as  a  function  of  K (t),  L(t)  A(t)  and  the 
parameters  is  given  by 
A(t)L(t) 
K (t) 

r(t) = α

. 

9.  The  Euler  equation  is 

r(t) − ρ 
C˙ (t) 
. 
σ 
C (t) 
To derive  it  (not  required  in  the  exam),  notice  that  the ﬂow budget  constraint  of  the 
representative  household  is 
A˙ (t) = r(t)A(t) + w(t)L(t) − C (t), 

= 

so  the  Hamiltonian  is 

+ µ(t)[r(t)A(t) + w(t)L(t) − C (t)]. 

−ρt C (t)1−σ 
H (t) = e 
1 − σ 
∂H (t)
The two ﬁrst order conditions used in the derivation of the Euler equation are  ∂C (t)  = 
0,  which  can  be  written  as 
e −ρtC (t)−σ  = µ(t) 
and  µ˙ (t) = − ∂H (t) 
∂A(t) ,  which  can  be  rewritten  as 
µ˙ (t) 
= −r(t). 
µ(t) 

Diﬀerentiating  the  ﬁrst  equation  with  respect  to  time  yields 
= −ρ − σ

C˙ (t)

Combining  these  results  yields  the  Euler  equation. 
To  give  an  economic  interpretation  of  this  condition,  suppose  it  were  violated  in  the 
following  way: 
r(t) − ρ 
C˙ (t) 
,
C (t) 
σ 
In  this  situation  the  interest  rate  (the  marginal  rate  of  transformation)  exceeds  the 
marginal  rate  of  substitution  between  consumption  tomorrow  and  consumption  to-
day,  and  the  representative  household  can  do  better  by  consuming  more  tomorrow 
relative  to  today,  i.e.  by  increasing  consumption  growth.  An  analogous  argument 
rules out the reversed  inequality.  Here σ  is the  inverse of the elasticity of  intertempo­
ral  substitution.  If  this  elasticity  is  high,  the  household  is  very  willing  to  substitute 
consumption across time, and as a consequence consumption growth is very reponsive 
to  diﬀerences  between  the  interest  rate  and  the  rate  of  time  preference. 

 

10.	 This  part  is  very  diﬃcult  and  actually  nobody  solved  it.  Here  we  are  dealing  with  a 
three-dimensional  dynamic  system.  The  three  variables  I  will  use  are  gA ,  gK  and  r 
(there  are  more  convenient  choices,  but  this  one  is  more  consistent  with  the  compu­
tations  for  a  constant  savings  rate).  It  is  straigthforward  to  compute 

g˙ A (t) 
gA (t) 
r(t) 
˙
r(t) 
The  equation  of motion  for  capital  is K˙ (t) = Y (t) − C (t),  so 

= φαgK (t) + (φ(1 − α) − 1)gA (t) + φ(1 − α)n, 
= (1 − α)(gA (t) + n − gK (t)).

Then  the  growth  rates  on  the  balanced  growth  path  are  gC  =  gY  =  gK  =  1−φ n  and 
∗ 
∗ 
φ 
σ 
gA  =  1−φ n,  and  the  interest  rate  on	 the  balanced  growth  path  is  r  =  1−φ n + ρ. 
The  condition  ρ >  1−σ 
∗
∗
1−φ n  insures  that  r  > gY  , which  is  needed  because  otherwise  the 
household  could  attain  inﬁnite  lifetime  utility. 
Endogenizing savings does not change the growth rates on the balanced growth path. 
In  particular,  they  do  not  depend  on  σ  and  ρ.  This  is  not  surprising  given  that  the 
growth  rates were  also  independent  of  the  exogenous  savings  rate.  Savings  behavior, 
whether  optimizing  or  given  by  a  constant  savings  rate,  does  not  aﬀect  long  run 
growth  in  this model.
