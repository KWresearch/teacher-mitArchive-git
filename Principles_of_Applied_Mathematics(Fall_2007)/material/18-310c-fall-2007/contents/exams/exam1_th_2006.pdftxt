18.310 Exam  1  - Take Home Part 

Problem  1  (20  points) 

A)  Find  a  prime  polynomial  of  degree  7. 

B)  Construct  a  2  error  correction  code. 

C)  Construct  a  3  error  correction  code. 

We  only  want  the  encoder.  Your  encoder  for  2  errors  Problem  1(B)  will  be 
used  for  Problem  2(A). 

Problem  2  (80  points) Make  a  spreadsheet  that: 

A)  With  your  2  error  correcting  code,  accepts  any  input  message,  and 
encodes  it  with  your  2  error  correcting  code.


B)  Allows  insertion  of  errors.


C)  Corrects  up  to  2  errors.


C)  Decodes  the  corrected  result  to  Ô¨Ånd  the  original message.


This  wil l  be  graded  by  testing  to  see  if  it  works.  Please  point  out  at  the  top 
of  the  spreadsheet  where  everything  is. 

Problem  3  (20  points)  Show  that  there  are  is  no  2-error  correcting  code 
with  15  message  bits  and  8  check  bits.  The  total  codeword  length  is  23  (15 
information  message  bits  and  8  check  bits).  Hint:  Think  about  the  space  of 
total  codewords.
