18.310  Exam  2  Take-Home


Problem  1:  RSA  (10  points) 

The received message r = 1598936 is intercepted and you want to break the code.  The 
RSA  code  used:  message  m  is  raised  to  the  power  M  (Mod  N ),  where  M  =  125879 
and N  = 2044459,  so  r = mM  Mod N .  Retrieve  the  original message m. 

Problem  2:  FFT  (20  points) 

Use the Fast Fourier Transform to multiply 8675301357902468 and 1812768642097531. 
(see  attached  notes  on  carrying) 

Problem  3:  Sequential  Choice  (20  points) 

In  this problem,  you will work  out  the details  of  the problem  (below)  given  in  the 
in-class  exam. 
Suppose  you  have  been  observing  the  price  of  a  stock  for  10  days  and  want  to 
buy  it  within  the  next  15  days.  Assume  you  are  permitted  to  buy  only  at  noon  each 
day  at  the  current  price.  Assume  that  noon  prices  are  randomly  distributed  in  rank 
over  this  period  without  correlation.  Suppose  you  earn  a  bonus  if  you  purchase  at 
the  lowest or second  lowest noon price during this period.  What should your strategy 
look  like  if  you  seek  only  to  earn  this  bonus? 
Determine  the  best  strategy  available  to  you.  (hint:  There  are  2  thresholds. 
Classify  by  the  best  rank  up  to  the  Ô¨Årst  threshold  and  second  best  up  to  the  second 
threshold.)
