18.310 Exam #1 

1.	 Given N coins of which all have the same weight and at most one which has a different weight. You want 
to locate the different weight coin or declare that all the coins are the same weight, using a balance at most 
k times. How large can N be for you to succeed in doing so, if you have a additional coin that you know to 
be good? If not? Describe the rules the weighing matrix must follow. Please indicate your reasoning in 
obtaining your answers. 

2.	 State Shannonâ€™s Second (noisy channel) Theorem, and give a brief outline of its proof, in both directions. 

3.	 Which of the following polynomials are primitive? 

1 + x2 + x7 + x9 

1 + x2 + x6 

1 + x3 + x6 

1 + x + x7 

1 + x + x5 

4.  A. If you use (1 + x + x6) as your primitive polynomial p(x) to define remainders, what condition must the 
additional factor q(x) obey so that p(x)q(x) will be a two error  correcting BCH code? 

B. Find q(x) here. 

5. A. Suppose an experiment is repeated n times independently and an event E occurswith probability p each 
time. What is the probability that E occurs exactly k times? 

B. Apply Stirling's formula to the exact expression under the assumption that pn and n(1-p) are large. 
What do you get?
