18.310  Exam  2


•	 You  have  50 minutes  to  complete  this  exam. 
• 
One  8.5”  x  11”  sheet  of  notes  allowed.  No  calculators  allowed. 
•	 A  correct  answer  does  not  guarantee  full  credit  and  a  wrong  answer  does  not 
guarantee  loss  of  credit.  You  should  concisely  indicate  your  reasoning.  The 
grade  on  each problem  is based  on  our  judgment  of  your  level  of understanding 
as  reﬂected  by  what  you  have  written. 
•	 For  all  True/False  questions,  a  very  short,  clear  and  concise  explanation  must 
be  provided.  A  correct  answer  with  wrong  reasoning  nets  zero  points. 
•	 There  are  4  problems.  Budget  your  time  accordingly. 

Problem  1:  (25  points) 
Let M  be a N × N  matrix with  entries  either “0” or “1”.  Each  row  sum and  each 
column  sum  of M  is  k .  Can M  can  be  written  as  a  sum  of  k  permutation  matrices? 
Show  why  or  why  not.  (A  permutation matrix  is  a matrix  where  each  entry  is  a  “0” 
or “1”  such  that each column contains exactly one “1” and each  row contains exactly 
one  “1”.) 

Problem  2:  (50  points  - 10  points  each  problem)  True/False  plus  short  Reasoning. 

(A)  There  exists  an  x  such  that  x200  = 2  (Mod 401). 

(Note:  The  number  401  is  prime.)

N , ·
(B)  If x  is an element  in  the multiplicative group  (Z∗ 
),  then  it  is always  true  that 
xN −1  ≡ 1 Mod N .  (The  group Z∗ 
N  contains  all  numbers  from  1, . . . , N − 1  that 
are  relatively  prime  to N ). 

(C)  In RSA coding, M  and N  = pq  are known to the public.  The encoder raises the 
message  to  the  power  M  Mod  N .  If  M  and  N  are  not  relatively  prime,  then 
the  decoder  fails. 

(D)  The  binary  expansion  of  a  large  N  is  (1101....10101).  On  our  spreadsheet,  we 
raise  an  arbitrary  number  x  to  the  (N − 1)th  power  and  get  the  following, 

x(1101....10100)  =  1  mod N 
x(1101....1010)  =  1  mod N 
x(1101....101)  =  x  mod N 
x(1101....10)  =  1  mod N 
x(1101....1)  =  x  mod N

The  number  “N ”  is  prime  and  not  a  Carmichael  number. 

(E)  In  Linear  Programming,  if  the  primal  problem  is  feasible,  then  so  is  its  dual 
and  the  optimal  values  of  the  ob jective  functions  are  equal. 

Problem  3:  (25  points) 

For  the  following  LP  problem,  set-up  the  ﬁrst  step  of  the  Simplex Algorithm  and 
demonstrate  the  ﬁrst  pivot  step.  Write  down  its  dual  as  well. 
Maximize  x1  + x2  + x3  sub ject  to  x1 , x2 , x3  ≥ 0  and 
5≤ 
x1  + 2x2  + 3x3 
x1  − x2  + x3  ≤  1 
x1  + x2  − x3  ≤  2 

Problem  4:  (25  points) 

Suppose  you  have  been  observing  the  price  of  a  stock  for  10  days  and  would  like 
to  buy  the  stock  in  the  next  15  days.  Assume  that  the  stock  prices  have  uniform 
distribution  over  the  25  day  period.  Your  goal  is  to  purchase  the  stock  at  the  lowest 
or  second  lowest  price.  Assume  for  simplicity  that  you  are  forced  to  buy  at  exactly 
noon each day, if at all, at the current price (you see the price once per day).  Describe 
what  you  would  do  (what  computation  you  would  make)  to  determine  the  optimal 
strategy  for  accepting  either  the  best  or  second  best  alternative  (you  win  if  you  end 
up with  one  of  these  and  lose  otherwise).  What  are  possible  best  strategies with  this 
goal?”  (A  long  answer  is  NOT  required.)
