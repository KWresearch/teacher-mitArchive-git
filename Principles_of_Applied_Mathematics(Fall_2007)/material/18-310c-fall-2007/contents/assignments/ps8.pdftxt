1a:  Suppose  that  you  have  a  necklace  of  length  15,  and  three  colors  of  beads.  How

many  diﬀerent  patterns  are  there  for  stringing  the  beads  on  the  necklace?

1b:  Suppose  that  you  use  ﬁve  beads  each  of  the  colors  green,  blue,  and  yellow?  How

many  diﬀerent  patterns  are  there  to  string  these  beads  on  the  necklace?

1b:  Suppose  that  you  use  three  yellow  beads,  4  blue  beads,  and  8  green  beads.  Now

how many  diﬀerent  patterns  are  there  to  string  the  beads  on  the  necklace?

2:  In  the  proof  of  the  tree  counting  theorem,  we  showed  a  correspondence  between 
functions  from  {1, 2, . . . , n − 2}  to  {1, 2, . . . , n}  and  labeled  trees.  We  can  use  this  to 
prove  theorems  about  these  functions. 
2a:  Let  the  smallest  label  of  a  vertex  involved  in  a  cycle  be  i.  In  a  random  function 
as  above,  show  that  the  expectation  of  the  ratio  of  the  number  of  vertices  in  the  cycle 
containing i and the total number of vertices involved in cycles is larger than  1
2  (consider 
for  the  probability  space  only  functions  from  {1, 2, . . . , n − 2}  to  {1, 2, . . . , n}  which 
have  cycles). 
2b:  Assume  that  in  a  random  labeled  tree,  the  number  of  vertices  on  the  path  from 
n − 1  to  n  is  l.  What  is  the  expected  number  of  cycles  in  the  corresponding  random 
permutation?  Make  sure  your  method  is  accurate  enough  to  ﬁnd  the  constant  on  the 
highest-order  term. 
Hint:  let  Ii  be  an  indicator  function  which  is  1  if  the  ith  ranked  vertex  on  this  path  is 
closer  to  n − 1  than  any  of  the  vertices  on  the  path  with  labels  less  than  it. 
Note:  The  argument  that we  used  in  the  tortoise-and-the-hare  factoring  algorithm  to 
show  that  the  length  of  the  cycle  in  that  algorithm O(�n)  can  be  combined  with  part 
(2a)  to  show  that  the  expected  number  of  vertices  in  a  random  tree  on  the  path  from 
n − 1  to n  is O(�n).  This,  together with  (2a) and (2b) gives a  lot of information about 
the typical  structure of random functions,  as well as the shape of random  labeled trees. 
3:  Consider  the  sequence  1,  3,  8,  20,  48,  . . .,  where  Sn  = 4 � Sn−1  − 4 � Sn−2 .  Use 
generating  functions  to  ﬁgure  out  a  formula  for  Sn . 
4:  Let  Tn  be  the  number  of ways  of  tiling  a  2 × n  strip  of  squares  by  tiles which  are  of 
size  either  1 × 2  or  1 × 4?  Give  a  recurrence  which  expresses  Tn  in  terms  of  Ti ,  with 
i < n.  Now,  write  down  a  polynomial  so  that  Tn  can  be  expressed  as 
 
�i�n
i 

�
i 

where  �i  are  constants  and  �i  are  the  roots  of  the  polynomial.  On  a  spreadsheet, 
compute  Tn  for  n  =  1  through  40.  Estimate  the  largest  root  of  the  polynomial  by 
taking  the  ratio  Tn/Tn−1 .  How  close  are  you?
