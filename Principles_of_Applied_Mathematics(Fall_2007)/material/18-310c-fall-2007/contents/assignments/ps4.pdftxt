18.310  Homework  #  4


1:  Write  a  one  to  two  page  essay  explaining  Shannon’s  ﬁrst  and  second  theorems 
(coding  for eﬃciency  and coding  for error correction).  What do they have  in common? 
There  should  be  a  brief  introduction,  and  it  should  be  typeset  or  word  processed. 
Equations should either be typeset in LaTex or composed using an equation editor (one 
is  included  with  Word  and  with  OpenOﬃce)  or  with  other  mathematical  typesetting 
software. 
 p 
2a:  Suppose  you  have  a  coin  which  has  probability  p  of  heads  and  probability  1 
−
of  tails.  You  toss  it N  times.  Give  a  formula  for  the  probability  that  there  are  exactly 
N q  heads  and  N (1 
 q )  tails. 
−
2b:  Take the above expression and use Stirling’s  formula to approximate  it in the  form 

2−N f (p,q) 

 q  and  the  logarithms 

where  f  is  a  function  involving  terms  composed  of p,  q , 1 
 p, 1 
−
−
of  these  quantities. 
2c:  For  N  =  100,  plug  p  = 0.6  and  q  = 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75,  into  the  above  expression 
(or  estimate  their  values  from  a  plot).  Do  the  same  thing  for  N  =  10, 000,  and  the 
values p = 0.6 and q = 0.6, 0.605, 0.61, 0.615.  What is the expectation and mean square 
deviation  of  the  number  of  heads  for  a  coin  with  probability  of  heads  0.6  and  for  the 
number  of  coin  ﬂips  N  = 100  and  10, 000?

2d:  If  you  had  kept  track  of  the  2�n  terms  in  Stirling’s  approximation,  you  would

have  needed  to  multiply  the  answer  obtained  in  (2b)  by  some  factor.  What  is  that 

factor?

3a:  Using  a  spreadsheet,  construct  a  Hamming  code  that  encodes  11  bits  into  15  and

corrects  one  error. 

3b:  On  the  spreadsheet,  construct  an  encoder  for  your  code. 

3c:  On  the  spreadsheet,  construct  a  decoder  for  your  code.  This  should  allow  you  to

input any message with a single error, and output the message with the error corrected.

A  hint  for  how  to  do  this  will  be  posted  later  this  week.
