18.310  Homework  #  9


1:  Set up  a  spreadsheet  that does  the FFT  for N  = 16.  Make your  calculations mod  a 
prime  p  that  posesses  a  primitive  16th  root  of  1.  Make  sure  the  cells  where  the  input 
sequence  is  entered  are  clearly  marked.  Take  the  FFT  of  the  output  (using  a  second 
copy  of  your  spreadsheet  FFT,  and  use  the  output  of  the  ﬁrst  as  the  input  to  the 
second.  Make  sure your  spreadsheet works by multiplying  the results by 16−1  (mod p). 
(you  should  get  your  original  sequence  back  with  the  order  of  coeﬃcients  backwards 
except  for  the  0-power). 
2.  Take  two  numbers  A  and  B  each  of  which  is  written  as  a  polynomial  of  degree 
seven.  Take  the FFT  of both mod  p,  take  the  pointwise  product  of  the  two  outputs  as 
input to a third FFT, and multiply each of the coeﬃcients of the result by 16−1  (mod p). 
Make  sure the cells where  the  input sequence  is entered,  and where  the output is  found 
are  clearly  marked.
