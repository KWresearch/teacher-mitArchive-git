18.310  Homework  #  7


1:  Write  an essay  giving Kempe’s  false proof of  the  four-color theorem,  and explaining 
what  the  ﬂaw  in  it  is.  Equations  should  either  be  typeset  in  LaTex  or  composed  using 
an  equation  editor  or  with  other mathematical  typesetting  software.  (Figures  may  be 
hand-drawn  if  it  is  easier). 
2:  Write  a  spreadsheet  that  implements  the  tortoise-and-the-hare  factoring  algorithm 
described  in  class  (and  the notes).  Make  sure  the  input  and  output  are  clearly marked 
and  easy  to  ﬁnd. 
3:  Use your spreadsheet to factor the number 294409 into primes.  This is a Carmichael 
number,  that  is  x 294408  = 1  (mod  294409)  for  all  x  relatively  prime  to  294409.  Use  the 
Chinese  remainder  theorem  to  explain  why  any  number  whose  prime  factorization  is 
(6k + 1) · (12k + 1) · (18k + 1)  is  a  Carmichael  number. 
4:  Consider  a  graph  obtained  when  you  replace  every  node  of K5  with  two  vertices  in 
the  following manner. 

is replaced by 

4a:  Show that there are several  (� 2) possible  such graphs.  (One way  to do this might

be  to  construct  one  graph  which  has  some  property  and  another  which  doesn’t  have

this  property.)

4b:  Explicitly  give  a construction  that ﬁnds  a  subdivision  of a K3
, 3  in  any  such  graph.

(It’s easy  to prove  this  exists using Kuratowski’s  theorem, but we want  a more explicit

answer  than  this.)

5:  Prove  that  every  planar  graph  can  be  drawn  in  the  plane  so  that  all  its  edges  are 
straight  lines.  I  will  outline  a  proof  by  induction.  This  can  be  quite  diﬃcult  to  prove 
unless  you  pick  the  right  induction  hypothesis. 
First,  show  that  it  is  enough  to  prove  it  for  graphs  whose  only  face  which  is  not 
a  triangle  is  the  outside  face.  Next,  prove  (using  induction)  that  if  you  have  such  a 
graph G with  k  vertices  on  the  outside  face,  and  are  given  any  k-sided  convex  polygon 
in  the plane,  then  there  is  a  straight-line drawing  of G with  the  outside  face being  this 
k-sided  polygon.  You might  want  to  break  the  proof  up  into  two  cases,  depending  on 
whether  one  of  the  edges  of G  is  a  chord  of  the  outside  face.
