18.310 Assignment 2: 

Problem 1 

Choose one of the sorting methods described in class (but not inse rtion sort) and write a one page essay explaining 
it. There should be a brief introduction. The sorting method shoul d be described in enough detail to let an 
intelligent reader implement it. You need not give a rigorous proo f of its efficiency, but you should explain, at 
least informally, why it works well. This should be typeset or wor d processed. 

Problem 2 

1.	 A procedure for sorting five keys using seven comparisons was give n in class. Give a procedure for finding 
the median of five keys using fewer comparisons. 

2.	 In the median finding procedure, if instead of sorting each of the  blocks of five keys, we find the median of 
each of these blocks, construct a procedure analogous to the one g iven in class. Find a bound of the form  cN 
on the number of comparisons this procedure requires (here N is the number of keys). 

Problem 3 

Suppose you want to find the largest ten keys out of a set of N keys. Describe how you would adapt quick sort, 
heap sort, and tournament sort to perform this task efficiently. Roughly how many comparisons would it take for 
each one? 

Problem 4 

Set up a spreadsheet that implements Batcher's sorting network for  32 keys. 

Test it to make sure it works with random inputs. 

How many comparisons did you need? How many would you need for 64  and 128?
