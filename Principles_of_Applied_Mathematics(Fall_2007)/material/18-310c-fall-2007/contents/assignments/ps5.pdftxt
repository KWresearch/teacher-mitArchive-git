18.310  Homework  #  5 

1:  Consider  the  following  polynomials 

i)  1 + x + x 2  + x 4  + x 6 

ii)  1 + x 2  + x 6 

iii)  1 + x + x 5  + x 7 

iv)  1 + x + x 3  + x 5  + x 7 

v)  1 + x + x 2  + x 5  + x 7 

1a:  You  should  be  able  to  tell  that  two  of  these  are  not  primitive  without  using  a

spreadsheet.  Which  two  and  why?

1b:  Use a spreadsheet  to construct  the remainder  tables  for the other polynomials and

decide  which  one  of  the  others  is  primitive.

2:  A  silly  code 
What happens when you try to apply the procedure for constructing a 2-error-correcting 
BCH  code  with  the  polynomial  x 3  + x + 1?  What  is  p3 (x)?  How  many  bits  does  this 
code  encode?  What  polynomial  do  you multiply  by  to  do  the  encoding?  Describe  this 
code more  simply.  How many  errors  does  this  code  actually  correct?  (You  can  do  this 
problem  using  a  spreadsheet,  but  the  calculations  aren’t  too  hard  to  do  it  by  hand.) 
3:  Our  2-error  correcting  BCH  codes  are  binary  linear  codes,  and  thus  there  are  two 
matrices  C  and  D  with  CD=0  so  that  you  can  encode  by  taking  the  message  m  and 
using  binary  matrix  multiplication  to  get  the  encoded  message  mC.  Similarly,  you 
can  ﬁnd  which  bits  are  in  error  by  taking  the  received  message  r  and  using  binary 
matrix multiplication  to  get  a  ”syndrome”  rD  which  depends  only  on  the  error.  From 
this  syndrome  (after  some  processing)  you  can  determine  the  position  of  the  errors, 
assuming  there  are  at most  two  of  them.  Describe  these matrices  C  and D  in  terms  of 
p(x),  p3 (x),  remainder  tables,  and  so  on. 
4:  For  the primitive  polynomial  1 + x + x 6 ,  construct  a  remainder  table  and  an up-by­
three  remainder  table,  and  use  these  to  ﬁnd  p3 (x)  for  this  polynomial.

5:  For the primitive polynomial p(x) = 1 + x + x 6 , construct a spreadsheet program 
which  will  let  you  input  remainders  rem(x a )  and  rem(x b )  and  will  ﬁnd  the  roots  (so­
lutions)  of  the  polynomial  y 3  + x y + x b  =  0.  You  will  need  to  construct  a  remainder 
a
table  and  an  up-by-3  remainder  table  for  p(x)  (you  already  did  these).  By  feeding  the 
input  into  the  ﬁrst  row  of  these  tables,  use  these  to  calculate,  for  each  j  between  0 
and  62,  the  result  of  plugging  rem(xj )  into  the  polynomial.  Then  pick  out  the  zeros. 
How many  solutions does  the polynomial y 3 + y + 1 have?  Find values  for rem(x a ) and 
rem(x b )  which  give  only  one  solution.  Factor  the  polynomial  y 3  + rem(x a )y + rem(x b ) 
for  this  case.
