Hint for constructing an encoder: 

What you want to do is add up the rows of the C matrix which correspond to 1's in your codeword. To do 
this, put m in a column next to your encoding matrix C. Now, you want to construct a new matrix next to C 
with just the rows of C where m is 1. To do this, you can multiply the entry of m in row i with the entry of C 
in (i,j) to get the (i,j) entry in the new matrix. You can do this by making just one entry and copying it. If you 
stick a $ before a row or column number in a spreadsheet, it doesn't change when you copy it, so you put the 
formula =C2*$A2 in a cell, then the C and 2 change when you copy the formula, but the $A always refers to 
the first column. You then want to add up all the columns (mod 2) to get the entries in the vector mC. We 
illustrate the process below for a non-very-good code.

Hint for constructing the decoder: Again, you need to do matrix  multiplication like you did to get mC. You 
already know how to do that. You also need to figure out which row of D is the same as rD, where r is your 
received codeword. The easiest way to do this (I think) is to construct an integer from the 0-1 vector r by 
considering r as an integer written in base 2. Do the same thing for each of your rows, and then use if 
statements to compare them.
