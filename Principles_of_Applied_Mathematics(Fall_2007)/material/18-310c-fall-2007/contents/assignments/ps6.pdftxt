 18.310  Homework Assignment #6: 

1. Choose two primes P and Q between 1000 and 2000. (They are chosen this size so that multiplying two 
numbers less than N = PQ doesn't overflow your spreadsheet arithmetic. Find them any way you want.) 
Construct an RSA encoder and decoder based on the number N = PQ as follows.

  1a. Find a suitable number c so that the encoded message r is found by taking the message m and raising it 
to the power c, so r = mc (mod N).

  1b. Now construct a spreadsheet program that uses Euclid's algorithm to find d so that the decoding is done 
by taking rd (mod N).

  1c. Construct an encoder on a spreadsheet that inputs the message, and outputs r = mc (mod N).

  1d. Construct a decoder on a spreadsheet that takes the outpu t from the encoder, and raises it to the dth 
power (mod N) to decode the message.
