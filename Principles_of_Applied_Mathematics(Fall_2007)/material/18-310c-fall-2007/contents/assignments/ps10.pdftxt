18.310  Homework  #  10


1a.  On  a  spreadsheet,  implement  the  simplex  algorithm  for  the  linear  program 

sub ject  to 

maximize  2x + y + 4z 

x + 2y −  z  �  4 
x 
+  z  �  3 
2x +  y + 3z  �  5 

and  x > 0,  y > 0  and  z > 0.  Perform  pivots  until  you  ﬁnd  the  optimum. 
1b.  From  the  tableau  obtained  at  the  end  of  the  simplex  algorithm,  give  the  values  of 
the  variables  which  result  in  the  optimum,  as  well  as  the  values  of  the  dual  variables 
that  result  in  the  optimum  for  the  dual  LP. 
1c.  Write  down  the  tableau  for  the  dual  linear  program  for  1a.  Is  the  origin  feasible? 
If  not,  write  down  the  tableau  you  would  use  to  ﬁnd  a  feasible  origin. 
2a:  Remember  the  Lempel-Ziv  algorithm.  One  way  to  analyze  this  is  to  use  a  linear 
program.  Suppose  you  have  n0  0’s  and  n1  1’s,  and  you  would  like  to  group  them  into 
the  maximum  number  of  distinct  phrases,  where  no  two  phrases  are  equal.  Explain 
why  this  number  is  approximated  by  the  solution  to  the  following  linear  program: 
 
xi,j 

maximize 

sub ject  to

ixi,j  � n0 
 
j xi,j  � n1 

0 � xi,j  �

2b:  Find  the  dual  to  this  linear  program. 
2c:  Use the relationship between the inequality being tight in the primal linear program 
and  the  slack  variable  being  0  in  the  dual  program  (or  maybe  vice  versa)  to  explain 
why  the  optimal  solution  to  the  primal  can  be  obtained  by  choosing  a  weight  w0  for 
bit  0,  a  weight  w1  for  bit  1,  and  then  taking  phrases  in  order  of  increasing  weight  (for 
the  right  weights,  of  course). 
2d:  (Extra  credit)  Give  an  intuitive  explanation  for  what  the  dual  linear  program 
really means  in  this  case.
