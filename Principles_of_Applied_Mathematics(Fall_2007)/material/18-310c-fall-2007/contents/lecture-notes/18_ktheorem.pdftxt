Kuratowski Notes

18.310, Fall  2005, Prof. Peter  Shor

Revised  Fall  2007 

Unfortunately,  the  OCW  notes  on  Kuratowski’s  theorem  seem  to  have 
several  things  substantially  wrong  with  the  proof,  and  the  notes  from  Prof. 
Kleitman’s website  are  too  vague  to  be able  to  deduce  the  proof  from  them. 
I’m just going to type in the OCW notes, changing things to make the proofs 
correct. 
We  can,  given  a  graph,  attempt  to  draw  it  on  a  piece  of  paper,  repre­
senting  its  vertices  by  points  and  its  edges  by  either  straight  lines  or  nice 
curves.  We  then deﬁne a graph G to be planar if  it can be so drawn without 
any  of  the  curves  or  lines  that  represent  its  edges  crossing  one  another  or 
meeting  a  third  vertex  on  the  way  from  one  vertex  to  the  other.  Note  that 
there  might  be many  ways  to  draw  the  graph  such  that  its  edges  cross,  but 
as  long  as  there  is  some  way  to  draw  it  such  that  no  edges  cross,  then  it  is 
planar.  For  example,  looking  at  the  graph  in  the  ﬁgure  below,  you may  not 
think  that  it  is  planar  because  two  of  its  edges  cross.  However,  the  same 
graph  can  be  drawn  in  a  diﬀerent  way  such  that  no  edges  cross  and  we  see 
that  it  is  in  fact  planar. 

One obvious question is whether we need to use curves for planar graphs, 
or  whether  all  planar  graphs  can  be  drawn  with  straight  line  segments.  It 
turns out that any planar graph can be drawn in the plane with straight  line 
segments  for  its  edges.  For  example,  the  graph  above  can  be  drawn  with 
straight  lines  as  follows. 

We  will  deﬁne  the  degree  of  a  vertex  to  be  the  number  of  edges  that 
contain  it  as  an  endpoint.

It  will  be  useful  later  to  have  a  notion  of  adding  a  vertex  in  the  midd le 
of  an  edge.  Adding  a  vertex  in  the  middle  of  an  edge  means  replacing  an 
edge  (a, b)  by  two  new  edges  (a, c)  and  (c, b).

We  will  say  that  a  subdivision  of  G  is  any  graph  that  is  obtainable  by 
adding  repeatedly  adding  vertices  in  the  middle  of  edges  of  G.  (For  the 
sake  of  completeness,  we  will  consider  G  to  be  a  subdivision  of  itself ).  For 
example,  the  following  ﬁgure  is  a  subdivision  of  the  graph  above.

Note that this deﬁnition is diﬀerent from the way Prof. Kleitman deﬁned 
subdivision  in  the  OCW  notes.  What  he  calls  a  subdivision  is  generally 
called  a  minor,  and  what  I  call  a  subdivision  is  generally  called  a  subdivi­
sion.1  Kuratowski’s  theorem  is  true  for  both minors  and  for  subdivisions. 
Another  obvious  question  is:  is  there  a  convenient  way  to  characterize 
planar  graphs?  Indeed  there  is.  Before  discussing  and  proving  it  we  make 
some  remarks,  which  we  will  prove. 

1.  There  are  two  fairly  small  graphs  which  are  not  planar, K 5  and K3,3 . 

2.  We  can  add  vertices  in  the  middle  of  any  of  these  two  graphs  as  we 
like,  and  that  will  not  help  to  make  them  planar.  Adding  a  vertex  in 
the middle  of  an  edge  here means  replacing  an  edge  (a, b)  by  two  new 
edges  (a, c)  and  (c, b). 

3.  Every graph which contains as a subgraph either K 5  or K3,3  or a graph 
obtained  from  these  by  adding  vertices  in  the  middle  of  edges  cannot 
be  planar. 

1

Actually,  when  Prof.  Kleitman  says  graph  G  is  a  subdivision  of  H,  the  accepted  ter­
minology  is  that H  is  a minor  of  G. A minor  of  G  is  a  graph  that  can  be  obtained  from  G 
by  deleting  and  contracting  edges;  here  contracting  means  deleting  the  edge  and merging 
its  two  endpoints  into  a  single  vertex. 

2 

This  means  that  if  we  can  obtain  one  of  the  graphs  K 5  or  a  K3,3  from 
G  by  deleting  (throwing  away)  some  edges,  and  replacing  long  paths  in  the 
resulting  graph  by  single  edges,  than  G  is  not  planar. 

K 3,3 
K 5 
We  will  now  prove  these  statements.  The  ﬁrst  follows  from  this  remark. 
If  we  take  any  drawing  of  either  K5  (or  more  generally  K2j+1 )  or  K3,3  (or 
more  generally  K2k+1,2j+1 )  in  the  plane)  the  number  of  crossings  between 
edges  whose  vertex  sets  are  disjoint2  has  the  same  value  mod  2  in  each 
drawing  (we  count  a  point  of  tangency  between  two  edges  as  either  2  or  0 
crossings). 
It  follows  immediately  from  this  statement  that  if  we  can  ﬁnd  a  draw­
ing  of  either  K5  or  K3,3  with  an  odd  number  of  crossings  between  edges 
whose  vertex  sets  are  disjoint,  it  cannot  be  drawn with  any  even  number  of 
crossings,  including  zero. 
So  let  us  prove  the  statement. 
We start with two drawings of the same graph, with vertex sets the same 
for  each.  We  will  take  each  edge  of  the  ﬁrst  one  at  a  time  and  slowly  and 
continuously  move  it  until  it  reaches  the  position  of  the  same  edge  in  he 
second  drawings.  When  we  are  done,  the  two  drawings  will  be  identical,  so 
they  will  have  the  same  number  of  crossings. 
To  prove  the  result we  notice  that  the  number of  crossings  of  the moved 
edge  with  any  other  edge  having  diﬀerent  endpoints  can  only  change  by  an 
even  number. 
How  could  it  change? 
If  the  edge  m  being  moved  does  not  either  become  tangent  to  another 
edge  q  or  cross  over  one  of  the  endpoints  of  another  edge,  the  number  of 
crossings between m and q will not change  in any way.  The crossings,  if any, 
will  merely  slide  along  q . 
When  m  and  q  become  tangent  and  then  cross,  or  become  tangent  and 
uncross,  the  number  of  crossings  between  m  and  q  will  change  by  2. 

2

The  reason  we  have  to  count  crossings  with  disjoint  endpoints  is  because  if  two  edges 
share  an  endpoint,  then  we  could  make  them  cross  each  other  an  arbitrary  number  of 
times  if  we  wanted  to.  If  we  are  using  straight-line  drawings,  these  edges  never  cross  at 
all.

When  m  crosses  over  an  endpoint  v ,  the  number  of  crossings  of  m  with 
every  edge  containing  v  changes  by  1,  either  up  or  down. 
In  the  case  of K2j+1 ,  since  every  vertex  shares  an  edge  with  every  other 
vertex,  two  of  these  crossings  will  involve  edges  that  share  endpoints  with 
the  two  ends  of  m.  The  number  of  crossings  not  counting  these  two  (since 
these  edges  do  not  have  disjoint  vertex  sets)  will  therefore  change  by  an 
even  number  when  m  passes  over  v  (since  the  vertices  of  K 2j+1  have  even 
degree),  which  is  0 mod  2.

We conclude that the number of crossings in either case can never change 
mod  2  as  the  ﬁrst  drawing  is  transformed  into  the  second  one.  Thus,  the 
number  of  crossings  mod  2  must  have  been  the  same  to  begin  with,  which 
is  what  we  sent  out  to  prove 
Q.E.D. 
We  turn  then  to  the  question  posed  above  of  how  to  characterize  planar 
graphs.  It  turns  out  that  there  is  a  very  nice  theorem,  called  Kuratowski’s 
Theorem,  which  tells  us  exactly  when  a  graph  is  non-planar 
A  graph  is  planar  if  it  does  not  contain  a  subgraph  that  is  a  subdivision 
of  K5  or  K3,3 . 
This  theorem  tells  us  that  the  absence  of  these  two  conﬁgurations  and 
their subdivisions, which we have seen are enough to ruin planarity, is enough 
to  ensure  planarity. 
We  will  now  give  a  the  proof  of  a  special  case  of  Kuratowski’s  theorem, 
as well as the outline of a complete  proof.  The special case  is the case where 
G  has  maximum  degree  3.  In  this  case,  Kuratowski’s  theorem  says  that  G 
must  contain  a  subdivision  of  a K3,3 ,  since K5  has  vertices  of  degree  4,  and 
we can never obtain a degree 4 vertex by subdivision of a graph of maximum 
degree  3.

In  the  presentation  of  the  proof,  I  will  try  to  do  two  things  at  the  same 
time.  We  will  start  out  presenting  arguments  that  apply  not  only  to  max­
imum  degree  3  graphs  but  also  higher  degree  graphs.  In  fact  Kuratowski’s 
theorem  in general  can be proved by continuing  this  line of argument.  How­
ever,  the details  seem  to get pretty  complicated,  and at  the point when they 
start getting diﬃcult, we’ll switch to talking about just the case of maximum 
degree  3  graphs  so  you  can  understand  how  the  proof  goes  without  wading 
through  all  the  messy  details.  I’ll  give  some  exercises  at  the  end  of  these 
notes  which  will  show  how  to  extend  the  proof  to  the  general  case. 
Recall  that we deﬁned a cycle  in a graph as a path whose endpoint is the 
same as  its starting point,  but which does not  repeat any vertex  in between. 
This  is  often  called  a  simple  cycle. 
Recall  that  a  chord  of  a  cycle  C  in  a  graph  G  was  an  edge  (not  in  C) 
between  two  vertices  of  C. 
Before  we  can  go  on,  we  need  to  deﬁne  a  bridge  of  a  cycle  C  in  a  graph 
G.  A  bridge  is  a maximal3  set  of  edges  in G  connected  by  vertices  not  in C. 
In  other  words,  it  is  a  set  of  edges  connected  to  each  other  by  vertices  not 
on  C,  and  connected  to  the  rest  of  the  graph  G  only  by  vertices  of  C.  For 
example,  the  graph  pictured  below  has  three  bridges,  two  of  them  chords 
(edges 2-4 and 5-7) and one of them having three edges  (connecting 1,3,  and 
4).  Every  non-cycle  edge  is  in  a  unique  bridge.

G 
Our  ﬁrst observation  is  that  it  is  enough  to  prove  Kuratowski’s  theorem 
for graphs G with no vertices of degree 2.  If a graph G has vertices of degree 
2,  we  can  remove  all  of  these  and  merge  their  adjoining  edges  to  obtain  a 

3

Maximal  means  that  it  can’t  be  made  any  larger,  not  that  it  has  the  most  edges  of 
any  such  set.  This  means  any  edge  adjacent  to  a  non-cycle  vertex  in  a  bridge  must  be  in 
the  bridge.

new  graph  G�  with  no  vertices  of  degree  2.  G  is  non-planar  if  and  only 
if  G�  is,  and  G  has  a  K3,3  or  K5  subdivision  if  and  only  if  G �  does,  so  if 
Kuratowski’s  theorem  holds  for  G �  it  also  holds  for  G. 
Suppose that G is a minimal non-planar graph.  This is a graph such that 
if  you  remove  one  edge  then  it  is  planar  (we  can  start  with  any  non-planar 
graph  and  remove  edges  until  it  is  minimal  in  this  sense). 
Our  next  step  is  to  shat  that  G  contains  a  cycle  C  with  at  least  two 
bridges.  One way  to  do this  is to  consider the  longest  cycle C  in G. Suppose 
that  it  has  only  one  bridge.  If  this  bridge  were  a  chord,  then  G  would  be 
planar,  so  it’s  not  a  chord.  Because  G  has  no  degree  2  vertices,  this  bridge 
must  connect  all  to  the  vertices  in  C.  Since  it’s  not  a  chord,  we  can  ﬁnd 
a  longer  cycle  by  taking  a  path  that  goes  through  the  bridge  (see  ﬁgure). 
By  the  deﬁnition  of  a  bridge,  all  the  edges  in  the  bridge  are  connected  via 
non-cycle  vertices,  so we  can  ﬁnd a  longer  cycle C �  by ﬁrst going  around the 
cycle  C,  then  going  into  the  bridge  from  vk  and  coming  out  on  v1 .

vk 

We  will  call  the  vertices  connecting  a  bridge with  our  cycle  C  the  feet  of 
this  bridge. 
We  say  that  two  bridges  are  “compatible”  if  they  can  both  be  drawn 
inside  C  without  edge  crossings,  and  “incompatible”  otherwise.  For  exam­
ple,  in  the  ﬁgure  below,  the  chordal  bridges  2-4  and  5-7  are  compatible, 
and  the  non-chordal  bridge  1-3-5-6-8  is  incompatible  with  them  both.  Two 
incompatible  bridges  cannot  both  be  drawn  inside  (or  outside)  the  cycle  C 
without  crossing.

G 
We  now  need  to  prove  that  if  we  have  a  set  of  bridges  of  C,  all  pairs  of 
which  are  compatible,  then  all  of  these  bridges  can  be  drawn  inside  (or  all 
outside)  the  cycle  C without  any  crossings.  This  can  be  proved  formally  by 
induction, by showing that there is one bridge which is ”inside” all the other 
bridges;  i.e.,  all  the  other  bridges  are  on  the  same  side  of  it. 
We  next  deﬁne  a  bridge  graph.  Its  vertices  are  the  bridges,  and  there 
is  an  edge  connnecting  any  pair  of  bridges  that  are  incompatible.  For  an 
example,  both  the  graph  G  and  its  bridge  graph  are  shown  in  the  ﬁgure 
above. 
If we take a pair of incompatible bridges, we can draw one of them inside 
the  cycle  and  the  other  outside  the  cycle  without  any  crossings.  If we  could 
do  this  for  every  pair  of  incompatible  bridges,  then  we  could  draw  G  with 
no  crossings  and  it  would  be  planar.  This  means  that  if  there  was  a  way 
of  dividing  the  bridge  graph  into  two  groups  of  vertices  so  that  there  is  no 
edge  between  any  of  the  vertices  of  a  group,  then G  is  planar.  The  graph  in 
the  previous  ﬁgure  is  shown  drawn  as  a  planar  graph  here,  by  moving  the 
two  bridges  1-3  and  3-5  outside  the  cycle.

We  thus  have  that  if  G  is  non-planar,  the  bridge  graph  is  not  bipartite. 

7 

We  saw  earlier  that  if  a  graph  is  not  bipartite,  then  it  contains  an  odd 
cycle.  In  fact,  it  contains  a  chordless  odd  cycle.  This means  that  the  bridge 
graph  of  G  must  contain  a  chordless  odd  cycle.4  Thus,  we  can  prove  Kura­
towski’s  theorem  if  we  can  show  that  any  chordless  odd  cycle  in  the  bridge 
graph  requires  a  conﬁguration  in  G  that  is  obtained  by  subdividing  edges 
from K5  or  K3,3 . 
At this point, to make things easier,  let’s restrict all vertices of G to have 
degree  3.  For  this  case,  we  are  able  to  show  that  we  can  assume  that  all 
bridges  of  our  cycle  C must  be  chords. 
Let’s show this now.  We’ll  concentrate on one bridge that  is not a chord, 
that  we’ll  call  Bi ,  and  show  that  if  it  is  not  a  chord,  then  we  can  replace  it 
by  a  chord  between  two  of  its  feet  and  still  have  a  non-planar  graph.  There 
are  two  cases.  First, we’ll  assume  that  the  chordless  odd  cycle  in  our bridge 
graph  is  not  a  triangle.  Then,  because  the  bridge  graph  was  an  odd  cycle, 
there are exactly  two bridges that are  incompatible with B i .  Call them Bi−1 
and  Bi+1 .  Because  they  are  compatible,  and  because  G  has  degree  three, 
they  must  look  something  like  the  following  ﬁgure.  Speciﬁcally,  the  feet  of 
Bi−1  are  between  two  vertices  v1  and  v2 ,  and  the  feet  of  Bi+1  are  between 
two  vertices  v3  and  v4 ,  where  v1 ,  v2 ,  v3  and  v4  appear  in  that  order  on  the 
cycle  C 5 .

G 
Now,  for Bi  to be incompatible with both bridges B i−1  and Bi+1 ,  it must 
have  at  least  one  foot  between  v1  and  v2  in  the  above  ﬁgure,  and  at  least 
one  other  between  v3  and  v4 .  But  then,  if  we  replace  Bi  by  the  chord  that 
joins these two feet, we get a subgraph of G which is also non-planar because 
the  bridge  graph  is  also  an  odd  cycle,  so  G  couldn’t  have  been  minimal,  a 
contradiction. 

4At  this  point,  there  are  two  cycles  around,  the  cycle  C  of  G,  and  the  chordless  odd 
cycle  in  our  bridge  graph.  Try  not  to  confuse  them. 
5 In  the  degree  >  3  case,  we  may  have  v2  = v3  and  v4  = v1 . 

8 

The  other  case  is  when  the  bridge  graph  is  a  triangle.  In  this  case,  the 
two bridges Bi−1  and Bi+1  must now be incompatible.  Again, although it’s a 
little  tricker,  it  is possible to  show  that we  can  replace B i  by a  chord  joining 
two  of  its  feet  to  ﬁnd  a  subgraph  of  G  which  is  also  non-planar.  (Exercise 
1.)  We  thus  have  that  all  bridges  of  G  are  chords. 
But  we’re  nearly  done  now.  If  we  know  that  a  degree  3  graph  G  has  a 
bridge graph  that  is  an odd chordless  j -cycle,  and bridges which are  chords, 
there  is  only  one  such  graph  G.  (I’ll  let  you  work  this  out  for  yourself  why 
this  is  true.)  I’ve  drawn  the  cases  for  j  = 3, 5, 7  below.  Now  all  we  have  to 
do  is  show  that  each  of  these  graphs  G  contains  a  K 3,3 .  For  the  case  where 
j  =  3,  this  graph  is  itself  a  K3,3 .  In  the  other  two  cases,  I’ve  highlighted 
the K3,3  by  labelling  the  points  1  or  2,  depending on whether  they’re  in  the 
ﬁrst  or  second  set  of  vertices,  and made  the  paths  connecting  them  dashed, 
thicker,  and  a  diﬀerent  color.

So  now  we’ve  proved  Kuratowski’s  theorem  for  graphs  of  maximum  de­
gree  3.  What  do  we  do  for  graphs  of  degree  4  or  higher?  If  the  chordless 
odd  cycle  has  length  ﬁve  or  more,  the  proof  above  that  all  the  bridges  are 
chords still works just ﬁne.  In this case,  it is no longer true that we have  just 
one  graph  corresponding  to  a  j -cycle  of  the  bridge;  we  now  have  a  choice 
in  constructing  the  graph.  Namely,  bridge  i  can  either  share  a  vertex  with 
bridge  i + 2  or  not.  We  then  discover  that  G  looks  something  like  one  of 
the  graphs  below,  and  we  have  to  show  how  to  ﬁnd  a  K 3,3  or  a  K5  in  any 
of  these  graphs.  This  is  not  too  hard,  and  is  an  exercise  below. 

In  the  higher  degree  case,  if  the  bridge  graph  is  an  odd  cycle  has  length 
three,  i.e.  a  triangle,  things get  tricky.  We  now  have  lots  of graphs G where 

9 

you  can’t  ﬁnd  a  non-planar  subgraph  by  replacing  a  bridge  with  a  chord 
across  two  of  its  feet.  Some  of  these  are  shown  below.  One  thing  that’s 
fairly  easy  to  show  is  that  no  bridge  needs  to  have  more  than  four  feet 
(otherwise  we  could  replace  it  with  a  smaller  bridge  connecting  just  some 
of  its  feet,  and  still  keept  it  incompatible  with  the  other  two  bridges).  This 
observation  reduces the proof to a ﬁnite number of cases,  but the details  are 
still  quite  tedious. 

Is  there  a  better  way  to  organize  these  details?  The  best  way  I  know  of 
for dealing with this  case  is  to  use  the  fact  that we  can assume  that C  is  the 
longest  cycle  in  the  graph.  This means  that  for any  bridge,  there  is  a  vertex 
on  the  cycle  C  between  every  pair  of  its  feet.  I’ll  let  you  work  out  the  rest 
of  this  part  of  the  proof  (see  exercises). 
Exercise  1:  Show  that  if  G  has  degree  3,  and  the  bridge  graph  is  a  triangle, 
then  any  non-chordal  bridge  can  be  replaced  by  a  chord  between  two  of  its 
feet  to  get  a  new  non-planar  graph. 
Doing  the  next  ﬁve  exercises  will  let  you  prove  Kuratowski’s  theorem  for 
the  case  where  G  has  degree  greater  than  3.  None  of  these  exercises  is  very 
hard.  Note  that  here,  two  bridges  can  have  a  foot  at  the  same  vertex. 
Exercise  2:  Show  that  any  graph which  has  just  chordal  bridges,  and where 
the  bridge  graph  is  an  odd  cycle  of  length  �  5,  has  a  subgraph  which  is  a 
subdivision  of  K3,3  or  K5 . 
Exercise  3:  Suppose  we  have  a  graph  with  three  bridges  B 1 ,  B2 ,  and  B3 , 
and  the  bridge  graph  is  a  triangle.  Show  that  if  B 1  has  two  feet  which  are 
adjacent  on  the  cycle  then  there  is  a  longer  cycle  in  G. 
Exercise  4:  Suppose  we  have  a  graph  with  three  bridges  B 1 ,  B2 ,  and  B3 , 
and  the  bridge  graph  is  a  triangle.  Show  that  if  both  B 2  and  B3  have  a 
foot  (these  could  be  at  the  same  vertex)  between  two  adjacent  feet  of  B 1 
(adjacent  around  the  cycle),  then  B1  can  be  replaced  by  a  chord  between 
two  of  its  feet  to  obtain  a  non-planar  graph. 
Exercise  5:  Suppose we  have  a  graph with  at  three  bridges B 1 , B2 ,  and B3 , 
and  the  bridge  graph  is  a  triangle.  Show  that  if  the  cycle  has  four  adjacent 

10 


vertices  belonging  to  two  bridges  B1 ,  B2 ,  B1 ,  B2 ,  in  that  order,  then  graph 
G  contains  a  longer  cycle.  (It  doesn’t matter  if  some  of  these  vertices  could 
also  belong  to  B3 .) 

Exercise  6:  Suppose  we  have  a  graph  with  three  bridges  B 1 ,  B2 ,  and  B3 , 
the  bridge  graph  is  a  triangle,  and  B1  is  not  a  chord.  Show  that  if  G  is  a 
minimal  non-planar  graph  with  no  degree  2  vertices,  and  C  is  the  longest 
cycle  of  G  then  exercises  3,  4,  5  imply  that  there  is  exactly  one  vertex  on 
the  cycle  between  any  adjacent  two  feet  of  B1 ,  that  B2  and  B3  are  chords, 
and  that  the  feet  must  alternate  as  follows: 

B1 , B2 , B1 , B3 , B1 , B2 , B1 , B3 . 

Dealing  with  this  last  case  is  easy:  do  it.
