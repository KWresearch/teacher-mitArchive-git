Some Notes on the FFT 

To do a 2k  FFT mod a prime p you need to choose a prime  p whose remainders include  2k-
th roots of unity, and you need to find one such root that is not a 2k-1-th root of unity, 

This can be done by taking the 2k-1-st powers mod p of the first few integers until you find 
one such that this power is p-1.  Get this power by successive squaring, and to be safe mod 
on each squaring. 

You then want to set up your spreadsheet without dollar signs, so you can copy it freely 

We describe a possible set up for this, for k=3 here, so that there are 8 input coefficients of 
our polynomial which we enter in opposite to the normal order. Thus to describe the 
number  12345678  which is written say, as the polynomial as 78+56*100+ 34*1002 
+12*1003  with coefficients in the order 78  56  34  12  0  0  0  0. 

I would do this rather inefficiently in space, by putting three rows of the modulus on the 
top, with three rows that give the appropriate powers of the 8th  root of unity where they 
belong. 

Then underneath that I would put the input and then put the three rows that do the FFT. 

The first row has to be entered in your favorite way. The rest of the rows can be obtained 
entirely by copying the first row judiciously/ 

How? 
let your data be denoted as 
Suppose you have the first row  of the FFT 
d0 
d7 
d6 
d5 
d4 
d3 
d2 
d1 
then the first row has the following entries (leaving out the mods and with x your 16th  root 
of unity) 
d0+d4  d0-d4  d1+d5  (d1-d5)*x  d2+d6 

(d2-d6)*x2  d3+d7 

(d3-d7)*x3 

(where you have multiplier rows above that look like

1  1  1  x  1 x2 1 x3

1  1  1  1  1  x2 1  x2

1  1  1  1  1  1  1 1

and multiply the appropriate combinations of the row above by the multiplier in these rows

above.


Then to form the second row, you copy the first and fourth and fifth and 8th  entrees here

down, and copy the first and fifth to the right into the second and sixth places and the

fourth and eighth to the left into the third and seventh places.

To form the third row you take the first and eighth and copy them down, and then copy the

first to the right into the next three places, and the eighth to the left into the next three

spaces.

A spreadsheet where this is done explicitly with formulae follows.

Here is the spreadsheet:
