14. Some Graph Theory 

*Editor ’ s Note: These notes are quite dense and pack a lot of material in.  If you have 
trouble following them, you may wish to reread the section or consult an outside source. 

14.1 Introductory Definitions 

We will investigate some of the basics of graph theory in this section. 

A graph G is a collection of vertices and edges connecting some or all of these 
vertices.  More formally, a graph is a collection E of distinct unordered pairs of distinct 
elements of a set V.  The elements of V are called vertices or nodes, and the pairs in E 
are called edges or arcs or  “ the graph” .  (If a pair (w, v) can occur several times in E, we 
call the structure a multigraph.  If edges like (v,v), which are called loops, are allowed, it 
is called a “ graph with loops ” .) 

Graphs are things that underlie many mathematical structures, and in fact 
anything that involves pairs of elements, which includes any kind of relationship between 
pairs of individuals. 

In a graph, a path from vertex v1  to vertex v2  is a sequence of edges such that the 
first edge contains v1, the last edge contains v2,  and each consecutive pair in the sequence 
has a vertex in common.  The length of the path is the number of edges in it. 

Thus { (v,w), (w,j), (j,z), (z,q) } is a path from v to q of length 4.  Here is a planar 
representation of this graph: 

A graph is said to be connected if for any two vertices in V there is a path from 
one to the other.  Graph (1) above is an example of a connected graph.  If (w,j) was 
missing from (1), then it would no longer be connected.  Note that by this definition a 
single vertex is considered a connected graph. 

Consider a graph G with a vertex set V and an edge set E.  A subgraph of G is a 
graph H with a vertex set contained in V and an edge set contained in E.  If the edge set 
of H consists of all edges of G whose endpoints are in the vertex set of H, then H is said 
to be an induced subgraph of G. 

Thus, the edge (v,w) and the vertices {v, w, j} form a subgraph of (1).  It is not an 
induced subgraph, since the edge (w,j) is in (1) and although both its vertices are in the 
subgraph, it is not an edge of the subgraph. 

A partition of a set is a collection of disjoint subsets (called blocks) such that the 
union of all the blocks is the whole set.  One place partitions are used is in the study of 
Riemann integration as means for dividing up the real number line.  A partition of the 
interval (1,10), for example, could be the intervals (1,2], (2,3],  … 
, (9,10). 

A partition of a graph G is a partition of both its edges E and its vertices V into 
subsets {Vj} and {Ej} such that there exists a graph Gj  with Vj  as its vertex set and Ej  as 
its edge set. 

A graph can be partitioned into its maximal connected subgraphs, which are 
called its connected components, if there are no edges that go between the subgraphs 
(since otherwise these edges will be lost in the partitioning).1  This definition derives 
from the fact that if a graph is not connected then it can be partitioned into subgraphs, 
each of which is connected, and none of which are connected to each other.  For example, 
graph (1) has 1 connected component.  Graph (2) below has 3 connected components. 

A cycle in a graph is a path that starts at the same vertex at which it ends.  A 
chord of a cycle is an edge among its vertices that is not part of the cycle.  In graph (3) 
below, the edges { (a,b), (b,c), (c,d), (d,e), (e,f) } form a cycle and the edge (b,d) is a 
chord. 

There is a standard notation for several kinds of graphs that are of general interest. 

The graph Ck  is a cycle of length k, consisting of k vertices and k edges. 

1 We can of course, if we want to, define partitions of the edges set of a graph, and let the vertex sets of the 
resulting graphs overlap. 

A complete graph with n vertices, written Kn, is a graph with n vertices that 

contains every possible edge.  The number of edges in Kn  is the binomial coefficient

(see the exercises for more info). 

14.2 Coloring Graphs 

One concept that is helpful for characterizing graphs is that of graph coloring. 
What we do is assign colors to each of the vertices in a graph with the condition that no 
two vertices that share an edge can have the same color.  There are many ways to assign 
colors to a particular graph, some of which require more colors than others.  Of course, 
any graph that has at least one edge will require at least two colors, and many will require 
more.  The minimum number of colors required to color a graph is called the coloring 
number of the graph.  A graph that can be colored with at least k colors is said to be k-
colorable. 

A graph whose vertices can be partitioned into k subsets such that no vertices that 
share an edge are in the same subset is said to be k-partite.  Thus, a bipartite graph is one 
whose vertex set V can be split into two parts, and all edges contain one vertex from each 
part.  Here is an example of a 5-partite graph with each of the 5 subsets colored to make 
them easier to distinguish: 

We can see from the coloring of graph (4) above that it is 5-colorable in addition to being 
5-partite.  In fact, from the definition of a k-partite graph, we can see that any k-partite 
graph will be k-colorable (see the exercises for more info). 

Kn,m  is the notation we use for a complete bipartite graph between vertex sets of 
size n and m.  Thus, it consists of two sets of vertices (one of size m and one of size n) 
and all possible edges with one vertex in set m, the other in set n, and no edges within 
each of these two sets.  Here is an example of a K3,2  graph: 

A basic question is: under what circumstances is a graph bipartite (that is, two-
colorable)? 

We can give the following necessary and sufficient condition for bipartness or 
two-colorability: 

A graph will be two colorable if it has no odd length cycles.

If a graph has an odd length cycle, then it cannot be two colorable.


We will prove the second part first.  Let G be a 2-colorable graph.  Suppose, in 
order to reach a contradiction, that G has an odd length cycle.  We will try to color the 
cycle one vertex at a time.  We start at vertex v1  and give it color A.  This means that all 
of v1 ’ s neighbors (the vertices with which it shares an edge) must have color B, since no 
two vertices sharing an edge can have the same color.  So v2  has color B, v3  has color A, 
and so on.  We see that all the odd vertices in the cycle will have color A and the evens 
will have color B.  Since the cycle is of odd length, it has an even number of vertices, so 
the vertex right before v1  will be an odd vertex and thus be given color A.  But this is the 
same color as v1  and since they share an edge, this is a contradiction.  Thus, the graph 
must not be 2-colorable. 

We can use a similar argument to prove that any graph that has no odd length 
cycle is bipartite (see exercises for more info). 

□ 

In a similar vein, it is not possible to color the complete graph Kn  with fewer than 
n colors.  In any coloring with fewer colors, two vertices must have the same color, but 
since a complete graph has an edge between every pair of vertices, this violates the 
condition that all edges must contain vertices of different colors.  Below is an 
unsuccessful attempt to 4-color K5  (note the red edge between the two red vertices 
indicating a violation of the coloring rules): 

14.3 Perfect Graphs 

A complete graph is often called a clique.  The size of the largest clique that can 
be made up of edges and vertices of G is called the clique number of G.  Recall from the 
previous section that any clique of n vertices must be n-colorable.  This tells us that: 

Coloring number of G  ≥  Clique number of G 

The coloring number of a graph can be strictly greater than its clique number, as 
we have already seen for odd cycles of length 2 or more.  These have clique number 2 
(which means it contains no triangle) but coloring number 3 (since we proved that odd 
cycles are not 2-colorable). 

If the coloring number and the clique number are the same for every induced 
subgraph of G, we call G a perfect graph.  Here is an example of a perfect graph.  Look 
at all the induced subgraphs and prove to yourself that this is in fact a perfect graph: 

The complement of a graph G is the graph on the same vertex set V, whose edges 
are precisely those that are not in the edge set of G.  Thus, the edge set of G and of its 
complement include all the edges of the complete graph on V, and the edges of G and its 
complement do not overlap at all.  As an example, below is the complement of (7): 

A famous result of graph theory is The Perfect Graph Theorem, which reads: 

A graph is perfect if and only if its complement is perfect.2 

The coloring number and clique number of the complement of G are parameters 
of interest by themselves.  The complement of G has all possible edges not in G.  Thus, a 
clique in the complement of G is a set of vertices among which there are no edges of G. 
We call this an independent set of G; a set of vertices unrelated by any edge of G.  For 
example, the two vertices in the upper right of (7) are an independent set because there 
are no edges connecting them. 

The number of vertices in the largest possible independent set of G is called the 
independence number of G.  Thus, from the previous paragraph we can see that, 

2 We could just as easily say,  “ If a graph is perfect then its complement is perfect”,  since the complement of 
the complement of G is G. 

Clique number of the complement of G = Independence number of G 

In these terms, we can describe the coloring number of G as the smallest number k 
such that we can partition the vertices of G into k independent sets.  In other words, 

Coloring number of G = smallest # of independent sets of G 

This follows from the fact that any two vertices of the same color cannot share an edge, 
and thus the vertices of each color form an independent set.  For an example, look back at 
(4) and see how each color is an independent set. 

We can similarly see that the coloring number of the complement of G is the 
smallest number  k ′ such that we can partition the vertices of G into  k ′ cliques.  In other 
words, 

Coloring number of the complement of G = smallest # of cliques in G 

This follows from the previous statement, along with the fact that an independent set in 
the complement of G is a clique in G.  As an illustration, we will look at the clique 
number of (7) and the coloring number of (8) to see that this holds: 

Using these results, we can now rephrase the perfect graph theorem (version II): 

If for any induced subgraph H of G, we can partition the vertices of H into a number of 
cliques given by the size of H’ s largest independent set, then  we can partition G (or any 
of its induced subgraphs) into a number of independent sets given by the size of its largest 
clique 

To see how this matches the original statement of the theorem, think about what it means 
for G and its complement to be perfect, and use the boxed equalities and definitions 
above. 

As an illustration, we will show how “ For any induced subgraph H of G, we can 
partition the vertices of H into a number of cliques given by the size of H’ s largest 
independent set ”  is equivalent to saying that the complement of G is perfect:  This 
statement tells us that the smallest # of cliques of H  ≥  Independence number of H which 

means that [the smallest # of cliques of H] = [Independence number of H], and we know 
from above that [the smallest # of cliques of H] = [Coloring number of the complement 
of H] and that [the independence number of H] = [Clique number of the complement of 
H].  Putting these equalities together we get that [the clique number of the complement of 
H = Coloring number the complement of H], and thus the complement of H is perfect. 
We can use a similar argument for the second half of the above restatement of the perfect 
graph theorem (see exercises for more info). 

Note that in any partition of V into cliques, since each vertex of an independent 
set, I, must end up in a clique that contains no other member of I, the total number of 
blocks of the partition must be at least the maximum size of any I (which is the 
independence number).  The same statement holds with the words  “ clique ”  and 
“ independent set”  reversed. 

This tells us that the concept of perfect graphs, and the restatement of the perfect 
graph theorem, requires that you can partition the vertices of any induced subgraph of G 
into a number of cliques given by the independence number of that subgraph.  Thus, the 
reason that our restatement of the perfect graph theorem involves induced subgraphs is 
that it would be false if we were to apply its condition to G but not to its induced 
subgraphs.  We can see this by considering the following graph, on 6 vertices, that can be 
described as a 5-cycle with another edge linking the sixth vertex to one vertex of the 
cycle: 

For this graph, the independence number is 3 and it can be partitioned into three 
cliques.  On the other hand, the clique number is 2 and it cannot be partitioned into two 
independent sets (verify these assertions yourself). 

However, the induced subgraph on the five vertices that form the cycle has 
independence number 2 and clique number 2 and can only be partitioned into 3 cliques 
and 3 independent sets.  Thus, by the perfect graph theorem, neither Q nor its 
complement are perfect. 

This leads us to a third way to state the perfect graph theorem (version III): 

If you cannot partition the vertices of G into a number of cliques given by the size of its 
largest independent set, then G has an induced subgraph H that cannot be partitioned 
into a number of independent sets given by H’ s clique number. 

Try to figure out yourself how this is equivalent to the first two versions of the theorem. 

14.4 Nice Graphs 

We will now look at another way to describe graphs. 

A graph G is a nice graph if given its maximum size clique C, whose size we 
shall denote as C  , we can assign integers 1 to C  to the vertices in C and can extend that 
assignment to all the vertices in V so that for each j, the vertices assigned the letter j form 
an independent set.  This is really saying that if G is nice then we can partition G into a 
number of independent sets equal to the clique number of G, which, if you did exercise 4, 
you will see is the statement that G is nice when its clique number and coloring number 
are the same.3 

A graph is c-nice if its complement is nice, which means that its independence 
number and the smallest number of cliques that its vertices can be partitioned into are the 
same (this follows from the results of the previous section). 

A graph is very nice if both G and its complement are nice (that is, G is both nice 
and c-nice).  In this terminology, graph (9) above is c-nice, but not nice, and therefore not 
very nice.  (9) is clearly not nice because it has an odd cycle and thus must be at least 3 ­
colorable, but its clique number is 2.  The complement of (9), on the other hand, has 
clique number 3 and has coloring number 3.  To illustrate this, we have drawn (9) and its 
complement below (since the complement is nice, we have added the numbering as 
described in the definition of a nice graph): 

A minimally not nice graph is a graph that is not nice, but all its induced 
subgraphs are nice.  Similarly, a minimally not very nice graph is a graph that is not 
very nice, but all its induced subgraphs are very nice.  A graph that is not nice at all is 
graph where neither it nor its complement are nice. 

If a graph is minimally not very nice, then either G or its complement are not nice, 
but the induced subgraphs are all very nice.  This means that if either G or its 
complement is nice, then that graph is nice, and all its induced subgraphs are nice, and 
thus it is perfect.  However, looking at the perfect graph theorem, this would imply that 
both graphs are perfect, which contradicts the fact that it is not very nice. 

3  Note how this differs from the definition of a perfect graph, which stipulates that all induced subgraphs 
must also have their coloring numbers equal to their clique number.  Nevertheless, we can see that although 
not all nice graphs are perfect, all perfect graphs are nice. 

The logic employed above allows us to phrase the perfect graph theorem in terms 
of niceness (version IV): 

Every minimally not very nice graph is not nice at all 

There is a stronger statement that had been a conjecture for about 40 years (called 
the Berge conjecture) but has just recently been proven.  It is called the Strong Perfect 
Graph Theorem.  One standard form of the theorem is (version I): 

A graph is perfect if and only if neither the graph nor its complement contains an odd 
graph cycle of length at least 5 as an induced subgraph. 

We can also phrase this theorem in terms of niceness (version II): 

The only minimally not very nice graphs are odd cycles of length 5 or more without 
chords, or the complements of these. 

It is easy to prove that these chordless cycles of length 5 or more are not nice at 
all (see the exercises for more info).  Thus, we see that the perfect graph theorem (version 
IV) is an immediate consequence of the strong perfect graph theorem (version II). 
Another consequence of the strong perfect graph theorem is that a graph will be very nice 
unless it or its complement contains a chordless odd cycle. 

14.5 Properties and Applications of Nice Graphs 

Nice graphs have some occasionally useful properties.  One is as follows: 

The size of the vertex set of a very nice graph G is at most the product of its clique 
number and its independence number. 

This statement follows immediately from these two facts: 

1.	

If G is very nice then we can assign an ordered pair (j,k) to each of its vertices 
such that those vertices with the same first component form an independent set 
and those with the same second component form a clique.  Also, j will run from 1 
to |C|, the clique number, and k will run from 1 to I, the independence number. 

2.	 No two vertices can have the same assigned pair; if they form an edge of G they 
cannot be in the same independent set, and if they do not form an edge they 
cannot be in the same clique 

The same idea used in this last result can be applied to an arbitrary set of N 
distinct points in the plane, each described by coordinates (j,k).  We can ask: what can we 

say about the size (|I| or |D| respectively) of the largest monotonic increasing or 
decreasing subset of these N points? 4 

We can define a graph whose edges are the pairs such that the line between them 
has non-negative slope.  A monotonic increasing set will be a clique in this graph, and a 
decreasing one will be an independent set.  We have an example of such a graph below. 
We see, for example, that points D, C, and B form a monotonic increasing set (a clique) 
and points A, C, and E form a monotonic decreasing set (an independent set): 

We want to show that: 

N is at most |I||D| 

To prove this statement, using the first result of this section and the strong perfect 
graph theorem, we need only show that the graph here defined can contain no chordless 
odd cycle of length 5 or greater, and thus is very nice (the same result will hold by 
symmetry for its complement). 

We will show that the greatest chordless odd cycle that can exist is a triangle. 
Suppose we have an odd cycle in a graph of the type described above.  Let us call one 
point (0,0) and suppose that the next point is (a,b) with positive a.  We can deduce that b 
is positive as well, since the slope is positive. 

We will arbitrarily assign a direction to the cycle, so we can talk about vertices 
that come after others.  Let us call an edge in which one vertex has larger coordinates 
than the vertex before it a  “ zig ”  and one in which coordinates go down a  “ zag ” .  Note that 
both zigs and zags have positive slope: 

4  A monotonic increasing set is a set of elements {x1,, x2,  …
, xn} where x1  ≤ x2  ≤  …  ≤ xn.  That is, every 
element in the set is greater than or equal to the element than comes before it.  A monotonic decreasing set 
is the same, except each element is less than or equal to the element that comes before it. 

Our cycle will be composed of these zigs and zags.  Since it is an odd cycle, there 
must be two adjacent zigs or two adjacent zags at least.  Suppose then that there are two 
adjacent zigs, and let the starting vertex of the first one be (0,0).  The next vertex around 
the cycle will then be (a,b) and the next (a+a ’ ,b+b ’ ) with a, a’ , b, and b ’  all positive.  This 
implies that there is an edge from (0,0) to (a+a ’ ,b+b ’ ) which makes our cycle a triangle or 
makes this edge a chord.  Thus, we conclude that the only chordless odd cycles in our 
graph are triangles.  We provide an illustration of an example odd cycle to show how 
consecutive zigs and consecutive zags can create chords (here in red): 

Therefore, using the argument from above, we get that N ≤ |I||D|. 

□ 

A common application of this statement is that: 

A permutation of N integers contains either an increasing or decreasing sub-permutation 
of length at least  N  . 

14.6 Planarity of Graphs 

*Editor ’ s Note: In some of the arguments in this section, we shall make some intuitive 
assumptions about the properties of curves on a plane.  Many of these assumptions are in 
fact based on topological concepts, and could be rigorously defined if necessary. 

A graph so far is an abstract thing, a creation of your mind.  It consists of a set of 
vertices and of edges. 

We can, given a graph, attempt to draw it on a piece of paper, representing the 
vertices by points and its edges by either straight lines or curves.5 

We then define a graph G to be planar if it can be so drawn without any of the 
curves or lines representing its edges crossing one another or meeting any other vertex on 
the way from one vertex to the other.  Note that there might be many ways to draw the 
graph such that its edges cross, but as long as there is one way to draw it such that no 
edges cross, then it is planar.  For example, looking at graph (7) you may not think that it 

5  In the previous sections, we have been drawing many graphs in order to illustrate concepts, but keep in 
mind that a graph is really an abstract concept that does not have to have a physical representation. 

is planar because two of its edges cross.  However, the same graph can be drawn in a 
different way such that no edges cross and we see that it is in fact planar: 

It will be useful later to have a notion of adding a vertex to an edge and splitting 
a vertex.  Adding a vertex in the middle of an edge here means replacing an edge (a,b) by 
two new edges (a,c) and (c,b): 

When we split a vertex, we take a vertex v and replace it by 2 vertices v1  and v2  so 
that each edge containing v contains one of these, and there is an additional edge 
containing v1  and v2.  For example: 

We will say that a subdivision of G is any graph that is obtainable by adding 
vertices to an edge of G or splitting vertices of G. (For the sake of completeness, we will 
consider G to be a subdivision of itself). 

We define the degree of a vertex to be the number of edges that contain it as an 
endpoint (we will use this definition later in the section). 

One big question we would like to answer is: is there a convenient way to 
characterize planar graphs? 

Before answering this question, we make some remarks, which we will prove 

1.	 There are two fairly small graphs that are not planar, K5  and K3,3 
2.	 We can add vertices in the middle of any edge of a non-planar graph as we like 
and that will not help to make it planar. 
3.	 We can split any vertex apart and that will not make a non-planar graph planar. 
4.	 No graph that contains K5 or K3, 3 or something obtained from these by adding 
vertices in the middle of edges or splitting vertices can be planar. 

To prove 1, we will use the following lemma: 

If we take two different drawings of either K5  (or more generally K2j+1) or K3  (more 
generally K2j+1,2j+1)  in the plane, then number of crossings between edges whose vertex 

sets are disjoint6  has the same value mod 2 in each drawing (we count a point of 
tangency between two as edges as either 2 or 0 crossings). 

It follows immediately from this statement that if we can find a drawing of either K5  or 
K3,3  with an odd number of crossings, it cannot be drawn with no crossings. (see 
exercises for more info). 

So let us prove the lemma: 

We start with two different drawings of the same graph, with vertex sets the same 
for each.  We will take an edge of the first graph and move it slowly and continuously 
until it reaches the position of the same edge in the second drawing.  We will do this for 
each edge of the first graph.  When we are done, the two drawings will have the same 
number of crossings between edges with disjoint endpoints, since they will become 
identical. 

To prove this result, we look at all the possible ways that the number of crossings 
in graph one could change, and show that the total number of crossings always remains 
the same, mod 2. 

How could it change? If the edge m being moved does not either become tangent 
to another edge q or cross over one the endpoints of q, the number of crossings between 
m and q will not change in any way.  The crossings, if any, will merely slide along q. 

When m and q become tangent and then cross, or become tangent and uncross, the 
number of crossings between m and q will change by 2, which mod 2 is 0: 

When m crosses over an endpoint v, the number of crossings of m with every edge 
of containing v as an endpoint will change by 1, either up or down. 

In the case of K2j+1, since every vertex shares an edge with every other vertex, two 
of these crossings will involve edges that share endpoints with the two ends of m.  The 
number of crossings not including these two (since these edges do not have disjoint 
vertex sets) will therefore change by an even number when m passes over v (since the 
vertices of K2j+1  have even degree), which mod 2 is 0. 

6  The reason that it must be crossings with disjoint endpoints is because if two edges share an endpoint then 
we could make them cross each other an arbitrary number of times if we wanted to, but it is easy to see that 
we could always draw them in such a way that they do not cross at all. 

In the case of K2j+1,2j+1, when m crosses over v, exactly one of the edges coming 
out of v will share an endpoint with m, and since the degree of K2j+1,2j+1  is odd, the 
number of crossings between edges which do not share an endpoint will change by 0, 
mod 2, when m passes over v. 

We conclude that the number of crossings in either case can never change mod 2 
as the first drawing is transformed into the second one.  Thus, the number of crossings 
mod 2 must have been the same to begin with, which is what we set out to prove. 

□ 

We prove remark 3 above by noticing that if a planar graph has a split vertex v, 
we can transform its drawing so as to make the edge between v1  and v2  shorter and 
shorter, until it entirely disappears, without introducing any crossing of edges.  In the 
process, we undo the vertex splitting. 

Remarks 2 and 4 do not require proof, as 2 is apparent and 4 follows directly from 
remark 1. 

We turn then to the question posed above of how to characterize planar graphs.  It 
turns out that there is a very nice theorem, called Kuratowski ’ s Theorem, which tells us 
when a graph is non-planar: 

A graph is planar if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of K5  or K3,3 

This theorem tells us that the absence of these two configurations or their subdivisions, 
which we have seen is enough to ruin planarity, is enough to ensure planarity. 

We will now give an outline of the proof of Kuratowski ’ s theorem. 

Suppose G is a minimal non-planar graph.  This is a graph such that if you 
remove one edge then it is planar (we can start with any non-planar graph and remove 
irrelevant edges until it is minimal in this sense). 

Our plan is to find a simple cycle C in G such that the graph G –  C has at least 
two connected components. (G –  C is the graph obtained from G by omitting all edges 
and vertices of C, except for vertices of C that also have edges that are not in C).  We say 
that two edges or vertices in G –  C are in different connected components if you any path 
between them has to go through a vertex of C. 

To find C, we remove an edge E from G such that G –  E is planar and draw it in 
the plane.  We then find a path in G from one vertex of E to the other that crosses as few 
boundaries as possible (you have to cross some or G is planar).  This will be a path that 
goes through G but goes through no vertex of G except those of E.  We now look at the 
outer boundary of the union of the faces of G –  E that this path goes through.  This is a 
cycle, and E is a chord of the cycle.  If G is non-planar, then this cycle will fit the 
description of C given above. 

The rest of the graph not in C can be divided into several  “ bridges ” .  A bridge is 
one of the connected components of G –  C.  The simplest example of a bridge is a chord 
of the cycle C.  In fact, it turns out that if G is a minimal non-planar graph, then all of its 
bridges are chords of C (see exercises for more info). 

We say that two chordal bridges A (with vertices A1  and A2) and B (with vertices 
B1  and B2) are  “ incompatible ”  if their vertices, moving around C, appear as A1, B1, A2, 
B2.  This means that two incompatible bridges cannot both be drawn inside (or outside) 
the cycle without crossing: 

We next define a bridge graph.  Its vertices are the bridges, and there is an edge 
connecting any pair of bridges that are incompatible. 

If we take a pair of incompatible bridges, we can draw one of them inside the 
cycle and the other outside the cycle without any crossings.  If we could do this for every 
pair of incompatible bridges, then we could draw G with no crossings and it would be 
planar.  This is equivalent to saying that if the bridge graph can be divided into two 
groups of vertices such that there is no edge between any of the vertices in a group, then 
G is planar.  Recall that a graph which can be divided into two groups in this way is said 
to be bipartite.  Therefore, since G is non-planar, its bridge graph is not bipartite. 

We saw in section 14.2 that if a graph is not bipartite then it contains an odd 
cycle.  This means that the bridge graph of G must contain an odd cycle.  Thus, we can 
prove Kuratowski ’ s theorem if we can show that any odd cycle in the bridge graph 

requires a configuration in G that is obtained by vertex splitting or edge subdivision from 
K5  or K3,3. 

Suppose, for example, that the odd cycle of the bridge graph is a triangle.  Then 
we have three bridges in G: X, Y and Z.  The pair X Y is incompatible, as is Y Z and X 
Z.  This means that the endpoints of the three bridges must be arranged in order around C 
as X1, Y1, Z1, X2, Y2, Z2.  We can see that this is a K3,3: 

If we have a 5-cycle, then the endpoints of the five bridges will be arranged in 
order around C as X1, T2, Y1, X2, Z1, Y2, W1, Z2, T1, W2.  We can then construct a K5  by 
contracting each bridge to a single vertex.  Notice that X1  is adjacent to T1  and W2  on C 
and X2  is adjacent to Y1  and Z1, so when contracted X will be adjacent to T, W, Y, and Z. 
This is true for all 5 bridges: 

Larger odd cycles in bridge graphs can be contracted into K5  graphs by 
contracting three of the chords to make three single vertices and judiciously contracting 
all the other vertices into the last two vertices of the K5.  We will leave the 7-cycle bridge 
graph as an exercise (see exercises for more info). 

This shows that every non-planar graph has a K5  or K3,3  as its subgraph, and 
proves the theorem.

Exercise 3 

Prove that any graph that has no odd length cycle is bipartite (2-colorable). 

Hint: You can use a similar argument to the one we used to prove that a 
graph that has an odd length cycle is bipartite, but in this case we get a 
coloring instead of a contradiction.  We can start anywhere on the graph 
by coloring one vertex v color A, v ’ s neighbors color B, their neighbors 
color A, and so on until every vertex that can be reached by a path from v 
is colored.  The absence of odd cycles means that each vertex will have the 
same color every time it is colored. 

Exercise 4 

Show that the statement “ we can partition G (or any of its induced 
subgraphs) into a number of independent sets given by the size of its 
largest clique ”  (from version II of the perfect graph theorem) is equivalent 
to saying that G is perfect.
