18. Counting Patterns 

18.1 The Problem of Counting Patterns 

For  this  discussion,  consider  a  collection  of  objects  and  a  group  of  permutation 
symmetries  (G)  that  can  act  on  the  objects.  An  object  is  not  a  mathematical  term,  we 
simply mean that the permutation symmetries are acting on any type of object; in the next 
couple  pages  we  will  refer  to  an  example  that  uses  a  beaded  necklace  as  the  object  in 
question.  Also, we mean  that  each  element  g  of G  can  be  applied  to  any  given  object A 
to form a new object.  In some cases the new object is different from A, but in some cases 
A is left unchanged, such that gA = A. 

We  want  to  determine  the  number  of  distinct  patterns  of  our  objects  there  are. 
Two objects A and B are  indistinct patterns  if  the application of one of  the  symmetries g 
to the object A brings it into B, such that gA = B. 

If you are confused about the two scenarios just mentioned (gA = B and gA = A), 
consider  this  example.  The  object  in  question  is  a  necklace,  and  the  group  elements  are 
things  you  can  do  to  reorient  the  necklace.  The  necklace  is  made  of  colored  beads  and 
we clone it such that we have two different necklaces that have the same pattern of beads 
on  them.  Then, we  place  the  two  necklaces  one  on  top  of  the  other  such  that  the  colors 
line  up.  If we  rotate  one,  the  two  necklaces  still  have  the  same  pattern, but  look  slightly 
different.  This  is  an  example  of  two  objects  having  the  same  pattern  such  that  gA  =  B. 
In  other words,  the  symmetry  g  acting  on A  is  a  certain  rotation  such  that A becomes B. 
On the other hand, if you forget about B and just take A and rotate it 360o  we still have A. 
This  is  an  example  of  when  gA  =  A.  g  in  this  case  is  the  360o  rotation.  More  about 
necklaces later. 

A  stabilizer  of  A,  denoted  as  S(A),  is  the  subgroup  of  G  such  that  all  g  in  the 
subgroup  leave  A  unchanged  when  applied  to  it  (gA  =  A).  If  g  is  not  in  S(A),  gA  is 
another  object with  same  pattern  as A.  The  set of  these  objects with  the  same  pattern  as 
A is called the orbit of A under action of G. 

Note  that  the  cardinality  (size,  number  of  elements)  of  S(A)  is  the  same  as  the 
cardinality  of  the  stabilizer  of  every  element  in  the  orbit  of A.  To  rationalize  this,  let A 
and B be objects, where B is the member of A’s orbit with the largest stabilizer.  Let g be 
some symmetry such that gB = A. 

We know S(B)B = B, where S(B) is any element in B’s stabilizer, since this is the 
definition  of  a  stabilizer.  Thus  gS(B)B  = A.  Since B  =  g-1A,  gS(B)g-1A  = A.  Thus,  by 
definition,  gS(B)g-1  is  in  the  stabilizer  of  A,  for  any  B  in  A ’s  orbit.  S(A)  then  has  the 
same cardinality of S(B). 

Also,  since  gS(B)B  =  A,  the  coset  of  S(B)  in  G  given  by  gS(B)  defines  a  set  of 
group  elements  that  take  B  into  A.  The  cardinality  of  gS(B)  is  the  same  as  S(B)  of 
course, written  |S(B)|.  Thus, there are  |S(B)| elements that  take B into A.  This is true for 
any A in the orbit of B. 

Furthermore, we know that the size of the orbit of B must be the number of cosets 
of S(B)  in G.  Since  |S(B)| =  |S(A)|, we can conclude  that  the size of  the orbit of A  is  the 
number of cosets of S(B) in G also. 

From Lagrange ’s theorem it follows that: 

[Size of the orbit of B] * |S(B)| = |G| 

That  is,  the  size  of  the  orbit  of  B  is  the  order  of  G  divided  by  the  order  of  B’s 
stabilizer. 

Now  we  realize  that  what  we  originally  referred  to  as  a  unique  pattern  is  simply 
an  orbit  under  the  action  of  G.  So  in  order  to  count  patterns,  we  need  to  count  the 
number  of  orbits  of  our  objects  under  the  action  of  G.  We  will  denote  the  orbit  of  A 
under G as O(A). 

To  determine  the  number  of  orbits,  we  can  sum  up  the  total  weight  of  all  the 
1
.  This sum 
(
|  A O 
) | 

objects in the collection, where the weight of each object in orbit A is 

is the number of orbits or patterns. 

We  know  that  |O(A)|  is  equal  to  the  order  of  G  divided  by  the  order  of  the 
stabilizer of B, using the formula above.  We also know that the sum of |S(A)| for all A is 
the  same  as  the  number  of  pairs  consisting  of  an  object  and  a  group  in  which  the  group 
element  stabilizes  the object.  Another way  to  look at  this  sum  is  the  sum over all g  in G 
of the number of objects stabilized by g. 

Thus, the number of patterns/orbits of a set of objects under the action of a group 
G  is  the  sum  over  all  group  elements  g  of  the  number  of  objects  stabilized  by  g,  divided 
by the order of G. 

Note  that  this number  is  also  the  average number of objects  stabilized by a group 
element  g  of  G.  Also  note  that  a  function  defined  on  our  objects  that  takes  the  same 
value for each member of a conjugate pair will be constant on any orbit. 

Based  on  these  two  facts,  we  can  conclude  that  the  sum  of  f  over  all  patterns  is 
equivalent  to  the  average  over  all  group  elements  g  of  the  sum  of  f  over  the  patterns 
stabilized  by  g,  given  that  f  is  constant  on  the  orbit.  The  proof  of  this  is  left  as  an 
exercise. 

As  a  consequence of  this  result,  the average of  the number of patterns or  the  sum 
of  f  over  patterns  stabilized  by  g will  be  the  same  for  all  g  in  the  same  conjugacy  class. 
Thus,  the  number  of  terms  in  the  computation  of  the  average  number  of  patterns  is  at 
most  the  number  of  conjugacy  classes  in  G.  As  we  have  seen,  for  S9  there  are  only  30 
partitions  of  n,  and  the  number  of  conjugacy  classes  in  the  this  group  is  the  number  of 

partitions,  so  that  you  could  compute  this  sum  of  S9  by  hand  if  you  had  to,  though  the 
size of the group is in the hundreds of thousands. 

18.2 Counting necklaces of n colored beads 

One  application  of  these  principles  of  counting  patterns  is  the  creation  of  n-bead 
necklaces,  each  of which  is  one  of  k  distinct  colors.  The  question  is:  how many  distinct 
necklaces can we create? 

To  clarify,  two  necklaces  are  distinct  if  there  is  no  way  that  they  can  be  placed 
one on top of another such that the colors of the beads all line up. 

The  set  of  operations  that  transform  two  identical  necklaces  from  different 
orientations  into  necklaces  that  are  lined  up  exactly  as  mentioned  composes  a 
permutation group of symmetries, which we will call Gn. 

cyclic 
If  we  number  the  beads  in  a  necklace  (1,2,3 …n)  we  can  perform  a 
permutation.  This  means  moving  the  necklace  such  that  bead  2  is  now  in  the  position 
where bead 3 was, bead 3  is  in position 4, and so on so  that  the general structure  is (n, 2, 
3, 4,…1).  Naturally, we call this a rotation. 

Another  permutation  is  a  reflection.  If  n  is  odd,  a  reflection  entails  keeping  one 
bead  fixed,  while  swapping  each  bead  of  distance  j  from  the  fixed  bead  with  the 
corresponding  bead  of distance  j  in  the  other  direction  from  the  fixed bead.  If n  is  even, 
there  are  two  ways  to  perform  a  reflection.  One  is  holding  a  point  between  two  beads 
constant,  and  swapping all pairs of beads with equal distances  from  the point.  The other 
method  is  to  hold  two  beads  on  opposite  sides  of  the  necklace  constant,  and  swap 
corresponding pairs.  See the diagram for clarifications. 

Let ’s look at the cycle structure of these permutation symmetries.  For reflections, 
if  n  is  odd,  we  have  one  block  of  size  1,  and  (n-1)/2  of  size  2.  There  are  n  possible 
reflections,  since  we  could  fix  any  one  of  the  n  beads.  For  an  even  value  of  n  with  the 
two  fixed  beads,  we  have  2  blocks  of  size  1  (for  the  fixed  beads)  and  (n-2)/2  blocks  of 

size  two.  There  are  n/2  such  reflections.  For  an  even  value  of  n  with  no  fixed  beads 
there are n/2 blocks of size two, and there are n/2 such reflections. 

If  we  operate  about  the  necklace  without  changing  anything  (360o  rotation,  for 
example), we call it the identity, which has a cycle structure of n blocks of size 1.  As for 
rotations, if n is prime, there is only one possible cycle structure having 1 block of n.  If n 
is  not  prime,  then  there  are  n/k  cycles  of  size  k  for  each  divisor  k  of  n.  That  is,  if  n  is  6 
for  example,  cycle  structures  possible  include  1  block  of  6,  2  blocks  of  3,  or  3  blocks  of 
2.  In any case, there are only n-1 total possible rotations.  Thus, the group of symmetries 
Gn has 2n elements. 

Consider the example where n = 10.  The following congruence classes of elements exist:

Rotation 
Note on cycle structure notation: Base number is cycle size, subscript is number of such blocks. 

Since  the formula for number of patterns of coloring gets contributions from each 
of  the distinct cycle structures,  there will be  five  terms since  there are  five  types of cycle 
structure.  Since there are 20 total elements (1 + 5 + 5 + 4 + 1), the size of the orbit is 20, 
and thus the weights of each term will be the number of elements in each class divided by 
20.  The weights  are:  1/20  for  the  identity,  4/20  for  one  10  cycle,  4/20  for  two  5  cycles, 
5/20  for  5  reflections  with  structure  2412,  and  6/20  for  5  rotations  and  a  reflection  with 
structure 25. 

Now  that we  have  the weights  for  each  term, we  just  need  to  find  out  how many 
colorings  are  stabilized  by  each  of  these.  We  will  do  this  in  a  counterintuitive  way  by 
introducing  some  notation  that  will  make  things  more  complicated,  but  will  allow  us  to 
solve some more difficult problems later on. 

We  start  by  introducing  the  variable  ts  for  each  color  s.  ts  is  one when  color  s  is 
available  to  use  in  the  necklace,  0  otherwise.  Realize  that  in  each  cycle,  the  same  color 
must be used, in order for the symmetry to be stabilizing.  That is, in a cycle of 5, all five 
beads  must  be  the  same  color.  Realize  also  that  if  the  action  of  the  symmetry  on  the 
necklace breaks the necklace into q cycles (for example, q=2 cycles of 5), and there are C 
total  colors  to  be  used,  then  there  are Cq  possible  colorings,  using  simple  combinatorics. 
k,  where  k  is  the  size  of  the 
The  number  C  can  be  replaced  by  the  sum  over  all  s  of  ts
cycles.  Thus, in our notation, the number of objects stabilized by a certain group element 
is:  (∑t k ) .

If we incorporate the weights of each class of cycle structures and sum over all of 
them, we get the following way to count patterns in our 10-bead example:

each bead, we can set ts  = 1 for s = 1 …7.  Then we get: 

You may now be wondering why we introduced such complex notation to solve a 
problem  that  could  have  been  solved with  elementary  combinatorics.  The  reason  is  that 
using  this  notation,  we  can  solve  many  more  similar  problems  with  slight  adjustments. 
For  example,  how  many  colorings  are  there  with  exactly  3  red  beads,  and  7  non-red 
beads, all other parameters being the same. 

If  there  are  three  red  beads,  tred  should  occur  with  an  exponent  of  3  (tred  is  the  ts 
that  corresponds  to  red),  using  our  notation. We  can  solve  this  by  finding  the  coefficient 
3.  This could only occur in the identity term and the second to last term.  Thus, we

18.3 Applications to counting tree patterns 

We  can  also  count  the  number  of  patterns  of  trees  on  n  vertices  this  way. 
Although  our  group  here  is  the  symmetric  group  on  n  symbols  and  this  group  grows 
rapidly with n, the number of congruence classes grows fairly slowly. 

To  apply  this  you  have  to  be  able  to  count  how  many  trees  will  be  stabilized  by 
each group element. 

Again the identity will stabilize them all, and for each other congruence class you 
must  count  how  large  it  is,  divide  that  by  the  order  of  Sn  and multiply  by  the  number  of 
trees stabilized by group elements in that class. 

Typically  you  can  choose  any  tree  on  the  fixed  points  of  the  congruence  class, 
then  add  on  a  leaf  for  each  cycle  to  it. When  cycles  have  the  same  length  you  get  trees 
when one is added to the other (in any order), but when cycles have different lengths their 
vertices cannot be added to one another so as to maintain symmetry. 

Thus,  for  example  the  cycle  structure  132  3  on  8  vertices  will  stabilize  trees  that 
starting  with 3  vertices  have  a  pair  of  leaves  added  to  any  one  of  these  and  a  triad  of 
leaves  added  to  another.  There  are  31*3*3  such  trees  stabilized  by  each  such  cycle 
structure,  and  there  are  C(8;3,3,2)  such  structures  where  this  C(8;3,3,2)  is  the 
multinomial  coefficient  8!/(3!3!2!)  which  counts  the  number  of  ways  of  picking  out  the 
tree vertices and pair and triad of leaves. 

Without actually summing the terms for say, trees on 9 vertices, note that it can be 
done quite easily, as many of  the 30 cycle structures cannot be symmetries of  trees at all, 
and  each  of  the  others  allow  computation  of  their  contributions  as  done  in  the  last 
paragraph. 

By  the  way,  this  sort  of  counting,  which  has  applications  to  counting  isomers  in 
chemistry, is called Polya Theory in honor of one of its discoverers. 

When  counting  tree  patterns,  bearing  in  mind  that  roughly  n/e  vertices  will  in 
general  be  leaves  for  large  n,  it  will  not  be  unusual  for  two  vertices  to  both  be  leaves 
attached  to  the  same  vertex,  and  this means  there  is  a  symmetry  between  them. Thus  the 
contributions from symmetries make a contribution here. 

Often  large  structures  have  very  little  symmetry  and  the  contribution  from  the 
identity  term  (total  number  of  labeled  patterns  divided  by  the  order  of  the  symmetry 
group) is close to the number of patterns. 

Exercises 

Exercise1 

Prove  that  the  sum  of  a  function  f  over  all  patterns  is  equivalent  to  the 
average  over  all  group  elements  g  of  the  sum  of  f  over  the  patterns 
stabilized by g, given that f is constant on the orbit. 

Exercise 2 

In  the  necklace  example  given  in  section  18.2,  how  many  colorings  have 
exactly 2 red beads and 4 green beads with 7 colors all together? 

Exercise 3  Write  out  the  general  formula  for  necklaces  of  length  23  analogous  to  the 
one given  for necklaces of  length 10 with powers of sums of powers of  ts, 
and  compute  how  many  patterns  of  colorings  there  are  all  together  for  5 
colors of beads. 

Exercise 4	

How  many  tree  patterns  are  there  with  7  vertices?  Compute  this  directly 
and  also  by  looking  at  all  cycle  structures  in  the  symmetric  group  on  7 
vertices, and counting  the average number of  trees  stabilized by  the group 
elements.
