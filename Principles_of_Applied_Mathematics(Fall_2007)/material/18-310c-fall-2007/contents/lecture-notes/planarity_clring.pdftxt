15. Planarity and Coloring 

15.1 Introduction 

We have been considering the notions of the colorability of a graph and its 
planarity (see notes 14). 

We have seen that a graph can be drawn in the plane if and only if it does not 
contain a subdivision of K5  or K3,3.  We have also seen how to determine whether the 
coloring number of a graph is 2.  We shall now examine the much harder problem of 
characterizing graphs of higher coloring number (at least 3-colorable). 

A natural question, which was raised back in the 19th  century is: What is the 
largest coloring number among planar graphs?  In other words, what is the largest 
number of colors you need to color any graph that can be drawn in the plane? 

A man named Kempe published a proof in 1879 that all planar maps are 4 ­
colorable.  However, this proof was incorrect and ten years later, someone noticed this 
and pointed it out. 

As a result, this became a well-known problem.  Was Kempe right?  Is the largest 
coloring number among planar graphs 4? 

Many mathematicians worked very hard on this problem and produced many 
partial results.  Finally, about a hundred years after Kempe ’s paper, a computer-aided 
proof was announced by Appel and Haaken.  It uses few ideas beyond those employed by 
Kempe, but applies them to thousands of cases using a computer, and provides a proof of 
his claim. 

We will provide a proof that five colors are enough to color any planar graph, and 
then present Kempe ’s flawed proof that four colors are enough. 

First, however, we must prove a few results that will be necessary in our later 
results. 

15.2 Euler ’s Formula 

Suppose we have a planar graph G, and we make a drawing of it as we discussed 
in notes 14.  The drawing itself has properties that G, as a set of edges and vertices, does 
not possess. 

In particular, the edges of G divide the plane into separated regions called faces. 
For example, if we have a simple 3-cycle as our graph, then it has two faces, the  “inside ” 
and the  “outside ”.  The following graph has 4 faces (3 inside and one outside). 

The boundary of a face is the set of edges that enclose it. 

If we define the parameters v, e, and f to be the number of vertices, edges, and 
faces of the drawing of G, there is a wonderful relation between these numbers that holds 
whenever G is a connected graph: 

v − e +  f  = 2 

If G has more than one connected component, then we change the formula a little, with cc 
being the number of connected components of G: 

v − e +  f  = 1 + cc 

This relation is called Euler ’s formula.  We will now prove it. 

It is obvious that this relation holds for a single vertex with no edges, as well as 
for two vertices with one edge between them.  We shall use an inductive proof by 
assuming that Euler ’s relation holds for a graph, and showing that it still holds if we add a 
new vertex or a new edge. 

Suppose we have a planar drawing of a graph G and we add a new edge or a new 
vertex to G so that the new drawing of the resultant graph has no edge crossings and is 
thus still planar. 

There are only a small number of ways in which we could add a vertex or an 

edge. 

If we add a new vertex on an edge of G, then this splits that edge into two edges, 
so e and v both increase by 1, so the equality holds.  If we add a vertex not on any edge, 
then it is an isolated point and so v and cc increase by 1, and still the equality holds. 
These are the only ways in which on can add a vertex, since it is either on an edge or not. 
Thus, Euler ’s formula holds for the addition of a vertex. 

Suppose we add an edge between two vertices of G.  If there is a path in G 
between the end of the new edge, then adding the edge creates a face and so e and f 
increase by 1.  Since there was already a path connecting the vertices, cc remains 
unchanged.  If there was no path connecting them, then f remains unchanged, but e 

increases by 1 and cc decreases by 1 (since we have connected two previously 
unconnected components with this new edge).  Since either a path connected the vertices 
of the new edge or it did not, so these are the only ways to add a new edge.  Since both of 
them preserve Euler’s formula, we see that it holds for the addition of an edge. 

We see that Euler ’s formula holds for the addition of a vertex or an edge to G, so 
we see by induction that Euler ’s formula is true. 

□ 

15.3 The Average Degree of a Planar Graph 

We now ask: what is the largest number of edges that a planar graph with v 
vertices can have? 

We can deduce the answer from Euler ’s formula. 

Each face defined by a drawing of G in the plane is bounded by a cycle of G.  If 
that cycle is not a triangle, we can add an edge between two opposite vertices and 
increase the number of edges.  Let us look at graph (1) from above as an example: 

The above illustration only shows how to turn one face into all triangles.  If we really 
want to maximize the number of edges in graph (1), then we can make 4 more triangles in 
the following way (note that triangles in this sense are faces with 3 edges; the edges do 
not have to be straight): 

We conclude then that a graph G on v vertices with the most edges will have triangles for 
all its faces. 

On such a graph, each face has three edges on its boundary.  We will form “edge ­
face pairs” between a face and each of its edges.  This means there are 3 edge-face pairs 
for each face, and thus 3f of them altogether. 

We can also see that each edge bounds two faces, so the number of edge-face 
pairs will also be 2e. 

We deduce then that  f  = 

32e 

f, so that in this case we can write Euler ’s formula 

1 

as

or 

v − 3 + 2e / 3 = 2 

3v = e + 6 

If we look at graph (2) above, we can see that this last equality holds in this case. 

We notice also that since each edge has two vertices, the number of edge-vertex 
pairs is 2e and is also equal to the sum of the degrees of all the vertices (recall that the 
degree of a vertex is the number of edges that contain it as an endpoint). 

This tells us that the sum of the degrees of the vertices of any planar graph G with 
v vertices and the maximum number of edges is 2e.  Using the equation 3v = e + 6 , we get 
that: 

[The sum of the degrees of the vertices of G] = 6v  – 12 

If we divide this by v, we get that 

[The average degree of a vertex of G] =  6 − 
v12 

We conclude then that for any planar graph on v vertices: 

e ≤ 3v − 6 

and 

The average degree of a vertex is strictly less than 6 

It follows from this second statement that: 

We can always find a vertex of degree 5 or less in any planar graph 

1  Since we are maximizing the number of edges, this will be a connected graph and thus cc = 1, and we can 
use the formula v – e +f = 2. 

15.4 The Five Color Theorem 

We now prove that we can color any planar graph with 5 colors. 

We proceed by induction, and assume that any graph with fewer vertices than G 
can be colored with 5 colors. 

If G possesses a vertex v of degree 4, then we look at the graph G  – { v}, which we 
use to denote the graph consisting of G without the vertex v.  By our inductive 
hypothesis, this graph can be colored with 5 colors.  Now we add v to G  – { v}.  The 
neighbors of v will have colors say A, B, C, and D.  But we have 5 colors at our disposal, 
so we can color v with the fifth color, say E, without causing any problems.  This means 
that we can extend our coloring of G  – { v} to G, and thus G is 5-colorable. 

The same argument applies if G has a vertex with degree less than 4.  So let us 
assume that all vertices of G have degree at least 5.  We know from the last section that at 
least one vertex of G must have degree 5. 

So suppose v has degree 5.  Once again we will consider G  – { v}, and color it 
with 5 colors. 

We will be able to extend the coloring to v unless all its neighbors have different 

colors. 

Suppose then that the neighbors of v in G have colors A, B, C, D, and E in order. 

Now, we start from the neighbor vertex with color A and find all its neighbors of 
color C, and all their neighbors of color A, and all their neighbors of color C, until all the 
vertices that can be reached in this way have been found.  We will call this an  “AC 
chain ”.  What we get will look something like this: 

Assume that, like in graph (3), that the path of alternating C and A vertices does 
not lead back the C colored vertex that is a neighbor of v.  This allows us to take all the 
vertices in this path and reverse colors A and C.  This will not harm the coloring of the 
graph G  – { v}, because it only affects the vertices on the AC chain, and there are no 
vertices of color A or C not on the chain that share an edge with any vertex on the chain 
because of the way we made it.  This means we could not possibly have two neighbor 

vertices of the same color that were not present in the graph previously, which means 
there are none since G  – { v} is 5-colorable. 

The effect of this switch is that now v ’s neighbor that used to be color A is now 
color C.  So v has two neighbors of color C (since the C vertex was unaffected by the 
switch since it was not on the path) and no neighbor of color A.  Thus we can extend the 
coloring of G  – { v} to G by coloring v with color A.  This means that G must be 5 ­
colorable. 

Thus, we suppose that there is an AC chain like the one described, except that it 
connects the neighbors of G of colors A and C: 

We cannot use the same trick as before, because if we reverse A and C on the path, then v 
will still have a neighbors of colors A and C, just in opposite places. 

Notice, however, that adding v to this chain creates a cycle in G, and that the 
neighbor of G of color B is on one side of this cycle while the neighbors of colors D and 
E are on the other side of it (this is independent of how we draw the cycle, and is not just 
true in graph (4) ). 

This means that if we start at the B neighbor of v and make a BD chain, there is 
no way that this path could contain any vertices outside of the aforementioned cycle. 
This is because if the chain only contains B and D vertices, then it cannot contain any of 
the vertices of the cycle, and thus it is trapped inside the cycle.  This guarantees that the 
BD chain will not be connected to v ’s neighbor of color D, which lies outside the cycle: 

So we can reverse the colors B and D on the BD chain and since it is not 
connected to v ’s  D colored neighbor, this means that there will be two neighbors of color 
D, and none of color B.  Thus, we can extend the coloring to all of G by giving v the 
color B. 

Therefore, we see how we can color any planar graph with 5 colors. 

□ 

The AC and BD chains that we used in this proof are called Kempe chains. 

15.5 Kempe’s False Proof of the Four Color Theorem 

Here is the way Kempe tried to prove the 4 color theorem. 

Suppose, again by an induction hypothesis, that G  – { v} can be colored in 4 
colors, where v has 5 neighbors in G.2  We can extend the coloring to v unless all 4 colors 
appear on its neighbors.  This means that starting at some neighbor, the neighbor colors 
in order are A, B, A, C, D. 

We will be able to extend the coloring to v if there is no Kempe chain linking the 
vertices colored B and C, by switching the colors of B and C on all vertices of the chain 
starting at B. 

So there must be such a chain, namely a B and C colored path between the 
neighbors of v of colors B and C. 

By an identical argument, there must also be a B and D colored path between the 
neighbors of v of colors B and D, or again we could extend the coloring to v by switching 
colors. 

This gives us two cycles isolating the two vertices of color A from each other: 

2  If v has 4 neighbors, then we can use the exact same argument as the previous section to show that G is 4­
colorable.  If v has less than 4 neighbors, then we can trivially show that G is 4-colorable. 

Because of the BC chain, we can make an AD chain starting with v ’s second A 
colored neighbor that is trapped and cannot reach v ’s D colored neighbor.  Thus, we can 
switch the colors A and D on the AD chain without changing the D colored neighbor at 
all. 

Furthermore, because of the BD chain, we can similarly form an AC chain using 
v ’s first A colored neighbor that cannot reach  v ’s C colored neighbor.  Thus, we can 
switch the colors A and C on this chain without affecting the C colored neighbor. 

So, Kempe argued, do both of these things.  This will change the first A to C and 
the second A to D, leaving us free to color v with color A, which will extend the coloring 
to G and prove the theorem. 

As already noted, this proof was published and not questioned for about 10 years. 

Can you see the flaw in it? 

15.6 Another Formalization of the Four Color Problem 

If a graph G is 4-colorable, then it is clear that removing any edges from G will 
not affect this.  So, if we could prove that for v the planar graph on v vertices with the 
maximum number of edges (as discussed in 15.3) was 4-colorable, it would mean that 
any graph on v vertices was 4-colorable. 

Suppose we have such a maximum-edge graph that we can color with 4 colors; A, 
B, C, and D.  Now, we are going to form a new graph G’ by switching the faces and 
vertices of G in the following way: We assign a vertex to each face of G, and we make an 
edge between two vertices if the faces corresponding to those vertices share an edge on 
G.  This means that each face of G’ is a vertex in G, and we color these faces the same as 
the corresponding vertex of G.  We call G ’ the  dual of G.  Here is an example of a graph 
and its dual (the numbers correspond to color numbers we will use later): 

The red box in our drawing of the dual above corresponds to the red vertex in the original 
graph. 

Since all the faces of a maximum-edge graph are triangles (as we saw in 15.3), 
this means that all the vertices of the dual to this graph will have degree 3.  You can see 
that this is true in the graph (7) above. 

We now look at the edges of G’ which form the boundary between the faces that 
are color A and color B and the faces that are color C and color D.  Since each vertex is at 
the apex of three adjacent faces and hence 3 colors, this boundary will pass through each 
vertex.  We draw the dual of graph (7) below with these boundaries darkened below (we 
have chosen not to color it in order to make the boundaries easier to see): 

The edges of G’ which are not boundary edges will have degree 1 at each vertex. 
It will therefore be a matching (or pairing) of the vertices of this graph: 

Had we looked at the edges not in the A C vs. B D boundary we would have 
gotten a different matching, and had we looked at the edges not in the A D vs. B C 
boundary we could get a third matching, and all of these are dis oint. (Try drawing these 
j
for the above graph to verify for yourself). 

Since each of the matchings are disjoint, and their union is the edges of G ’, we see 
that the union of the matchings for two of the color sets is a boundary for the third.  It 
follows then that the boundary edges in each case will form an even cycle, which 
connects all the vertices of G’.  This is true for the dual to any maximum-edge planar 
graph. 

This tells us that a maximum-edge planar graph will have a four coloring if its 
dual has a collection of even cycles which pass through all its vertices exactly once. 

Many attempts to prove the four color theorem have been based on this viewpoint. 
In particular, you could prove the four color theorem if you could show that every planar 
graph, with all its vertices of degree three, has a single cycle that passes through each of 
its vertices exactly once. 

Such a cycle is called a Hamiltonian cycle and these have been the subject of 
much study.  Unfortunately, it has been shown that there are planar graphs with all 
vertices of degree three that do not have Hamiltonian cycles. 

15.7 Brook ’s Theorem 

There is a nice result that we can prove about coloring graphs which can provide 
an upper bound for the coloring number of a large subset of graphs.  The result, called 
Brook ’s Theorem,  is as follows: 

Suppose the maximum degree of a connected graph G is d.  Then we can color the 
vertices of G in d colors, unless G is a complete graph or an odd length chordless cycle, 
which both require d + 1 colors. 

Here is a proof of the theorem. 

We have already seen in notes 14 that the complete graph on d + 1 vertices, in 
which every vertex has degree d, requires d + 1 colors.  We have also seen that an odd 
length chordless cycle, whose maximum vertex degree is 2, requires 3 colors.  We just 
have to show that all graphs not of this type can be colored with d colors. 

Let G be a graph of maximum degree d, which is not a complete graph or an odd 
length chordless cycle.  Since G is not complete, there are pairs of vertices that do not 
share an edge and since the graph is connected there must be two vertices whose distance 
in the graph from each other is 2.  (The distance between two vertices on a connected 
graph is the number of edges in the shortest path between them).  Call these vertices v1 
and v2  and let vn  be a common neighbor (a vertex of distance 1 from each). 

We assign the vertices indices in order, starting at v1  and v2  and ending at vn  in 
such a way that each vertex vj  other than vn  has at least one edge joining vj  with a vertex 
of higher index than j. (This ordering may or may not be possible). 

If the graph G’ obtained by removing  v1, v2  and all the edges attached to them 
from G is connected, we can obtain an ordering of the vertices by starting at vn, then 
making vn-1  a neighbor of it, vn-2  a neighbor of vn  or vn-1, and so on until all the vertices 
are listed. 

If we can do this, we can color G with d colors as follows: 

Give v1  and v2  the same color.  Go through the rest of the graph in order of vertex 
index.  For each vj, at least one of its neighbors has higher index and has not yet been 
colored, and since its degree is at most d, a maximum of d  – 1 neighbors have been 
colored.  We therefore have a color left for vj  that does not appear on a neighbor and 
color vj  with that color.  When we get to vn, two of its neighbors, v1  and v2  have the same 
color, so again at most d  – 1 colors appear on its neighbors and you can color it.  In this 
way, we color G with d colors. 

We will not be able to find the desired ordering of the vertices if v1  and v2  are 
such that by removing one (or both) of them we separate the resulting graph into 
disconnected pieces.  Here is an example of a graph where this happens: 

(Notice that if we tried to number the vertices of graph (8) in the manner above, 
we not be able to because the rightmost vertex neighbor of v1 cannot have a neighbor that 
is numbered higher than it.  We could remedy this by adding an edge between this vertex 
and the bottommost vertex, but then the removal of v1  would no longer disconnect the 
graph.) 

We will show to how color the graph with d colors for cases where numbering the 
vertices does not work. 

We assume that d is at least 3, because if G is not a 2-cycle or a path then d is at 
least 3 and if G is a path or a 2-cycle then it is apparent that a suitable coloring exists. 

We also assume by induction that Brook ’s theorem holds for every subgraph of G. 

If the graph G’ obtained from G by removing  v1  (or v2) is not connected, then we 
can color v1  and each of the connected components of G’ separately in  d colors by using 
our induction hypothesis, and glue them together to color G.3 

It could be that the graph obtained by the removal of v1  or v2 by themselves is still 
connected, but the graph obtained by removing both v1  and v2  is disconnected.  If so, we 
can color each of the connected components and v1  and v2  (with an additional edge 
connecting them) in d colors by induction, and then glue them together to color G. 

This coloring can fail only if one of the graphs for a connected component is 
complete with degree d and the other is the triangle containing v1, v2, and vn.  In that case, 
it can still be easily colored using d colors. 

This proves Brook ’s Theorem 

~Edited by Jacob Green 

□ 

3  Now, it is possible that one of the connected components of G’ is a complete graph or an odd cycle. 
However, if we look at the vertex v where v1  is attached to this connected component in G, then the degree 
of v will be greater than the maximum degree of the connected component itself, and thus G is colorable 
with d colors (since our inductive hypothesis and Brook’s theorem tell us that they can be colored by (1 + 
their maximum degree) colors.
