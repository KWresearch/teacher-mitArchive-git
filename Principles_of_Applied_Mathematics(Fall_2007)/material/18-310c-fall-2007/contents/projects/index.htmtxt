This term, you will do two papers. The first one should be at least five pages
long and double spaced. It can be about any topic in discrete mathematics
(using a fairly generous interpretation of this field), and should include at
least some material which is not covered in the course. It should have a
coherent introduction, and be written clearly. The final paper should be ten
pages long, and may be an extension of the first one, on the same topic.
***** Paper Topics *****
The basic idea is that you should take some topic preferably one not covered in
the course, and imagine that you were to give a lecture on it, which would
convey to someone of reasonable intelligence but no particular knowledge of the
field, what the subject was about and at least one interesting and non trivial
result in it. For those of you who are juniors or above this can be your phase
2 paper though you may have to work on it some so that others can take a
seminar somehow in perfecting it. Among possible topics are:
    * Hashing
    * Matching Theory
    * Other Error Correcting Coding Schemes
    * The New Primality Testing Algorithm
    * Novel Linear Programming Algorithms
    * New Ideas on Linear Programming and Complexity
