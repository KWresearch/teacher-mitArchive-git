(1) INPUT --OUTPUT MODELS
OUTPUT MODELS
(1) INPUT
• Inter-Industry Technology Matrix, 
Buy and Sell Matrices
• Regional Purchase Coefficients 
based on Location Quotients (Ratio of Local to 
National  Industry Intensity), adjusted for cross-
purchasing
• Assumes that future gains/losses of output or 
demand will affect suppliers and worker income 
re-spending in proportion to current patterns

22

Input --Output Multiplier Models
Output Multiplier Models
Input
• BEA (US), RIMS, IMPLAN, survey-based local studies
• Trace Inter-Industry Buying & Selling impacts of 
exogenous growth or decline in given industries
• Reflect Current Technologies and Local Purchasing

Can be used to Assess:
• Current Economic Role (Contribution) of an Existing 
Industry, Facility or Program
• Expected Impact of a Change in Output (Business 
Opening, Closing, Expansion, Contraction)
• Expected Impact of a Change in Spending and 
Sources for Purchases

Limitation of I --O Models
O Models
Limitation of I
• Not dynamic – no time dimension for response
• No effect of crowding out, excess demand to 
constrain large growth 
• No cost responsiveness
• Assumes fixed Location Quotients (local shares)

(2) ECON SIMULATION MODELS
(2) ECON SIMULATION MODELS
• Include I-O Matrices and Regional Purchase 
Coefficients as given
• Add Year-by-Year forecasting
• Add Labor, Housing Price / cost responses
• Add Migration Responses
• Allows for future effects on suppliers and worker 
income to shift with changes in supply and 
demand for labor and capital

1010

Regional Simulation Models
Regional Simulation Models
• REMI, REDYN, INFORUM, FAIR, REAL MODEL
• Forecast Base Case vs. Future Scenario:  price/cost 
mechanism as “Feedback Loops” to mitigate impacts
• Reflect Current Technologies and Local Purchasing

Can be used to Assess:
• Response to Proposed Changes in Taxes, Prices or 
Local Costs
• Response to Changes in Business Output (Opening, 
Closing, Growth) or  Spending  esp. when effects are 
large enough to shift labor or material prices.

Limitation of Simulation Model
• Linear – no thresholds – prices respond 
proportionately to demand changes
• Assumes generally fixed Location Quotients (local 
shares)
• Economic geography (if any) scaled by distance
• No recognition of international trade,  supply 
chain connectivity
• No recognition of education, infrastructure, other  
quality features among market competitors

(4) ECON OPPORTUNITY MODEL

• Assumption: “The role of economic developers is to 
make traditional economic models wrong” - G. Weisbrod
• Use “Benchmarking” to neighbors / competitors 
instead of comparing to national averages
• Use LQ to identify gaps in potential mix rather than 
current import/export roles 
• Assess strengths and weaknesses relating to 
Quality, Scale and Connections (rel to competitors) 
rather than only Prices / Costs rel to US as in econ 
simulation models.

2525

Economic Opportunity Model
Economic Opportunity Model
• Rate availability and quality of factors that are Not 
Covered by regional economic models
Identify how they affect economic development 
opportunities

•

Can be used to:
• Target opportunities for additional economic growth 
• Tailor projects and programs to address current 
deficiencies holding back further economic growth
• Assess risk / uncertainty associated with future 
project/program scenarios

Combining LQ and SS in Comparison 
to Competitors
to Competitors
• Local industry is strong in mix and growth trend
• Local industry is strong, could have potential for more growth
• Local industry is underperforming; opportunity for growth 
• New emerging local industry, candidate for nurturing
• Weak local sector, but some opportunity for growth
Industry is threatened locally, candidate for attention
•
Industry is in national decline, candidate for diversification
•
• Unstable national industry; opportunity for growth but some risk
• Weak local sector in national decline

Uses of Econ Opportunity Models
Uses of Econ Opportunity Models

Areas seeking to:
– Diversify their economic base 
– Become more attractive to growth industries 
– Expand job quality & pay level 
– Reduce dependence on stagnant or declining 
industries
– Improve business stability by enhancing 
supporting & complementary activities

Lessons
Lessons
Don’t Ignore the nature 
(adequacy and quality) of local 
facilities & services in addition 
to cost factors -- they can 
dramatically affect opportunities 
and impacts.

Set up the right order for analysis.  
First decide on the Policy Issue.  Then 
apply appropriate analysis tools to fit 
the policy issue  (not the reverse).
