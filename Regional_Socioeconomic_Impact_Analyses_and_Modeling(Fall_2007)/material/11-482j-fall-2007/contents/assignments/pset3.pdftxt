Regional Socioeconomic Impact Analysis and Modeling 

Problem Set 3 

Draft Due: SES # 14 
Presentation: Scheduled during the week of SES # 14 
Final draft due: Four days after SES # 14 

As we noted in class, Problem Set 3 will be a refinement of your Problem Set 2, but this time prepared as 
a single report by all members of the class.  We will provide one grade for all members.  In the final report, 
take into account the comments you received on PS2 and that the final product (report and powerpoint 
slides) will be presented to the BRA staff.  Your presentation is scheduled at the BRA during the week of 
SES 14.  With no exceptions, all students are expected to be at the final presentation.  For the final BRA 
presentation, we will do a dry run on the last day of class, SES 14, so that you must have all your 
powerpoints ready by then.  That will give you only a few hours to make any suggested changes.   We will 
indicate the number of printouts of the presentation you will need to bring with you to the client, but have 
a print out for each member of the class during SES 14, so that we can all mark and return to you for 
suggested changes. 

The final report should be no longer than 30 pages, including figures/tables/maps.  Have a draft ready on 
the day you do the BRA presentation, but we will allow you to revise it and submit the final version four 
days after our last class.  Be certain to use Arial or some other font that is sans serif and to use 12point 
font, double spaced for the text, one-inch margins on all sides. 

In the report, you should explain what the socioeconomic impact will be on the New Market area of the 
intervention(s) you decide should be taken and how they may or may not relate to the green initiative.  In 
the introduction, you need to be clear as to what you are doing and for whom (BRA research staff) and in 
the conclusion to the report, you need to summarize the key recommendations.  In the report, be certain 
to include: 

1. Title of report 
2.  Names of authors 
3.  Date 
4.  Introduction 
5.  Area being analyzed, including maps and the baseline information for New Market, Suffolk County, etc. 
6.  Brief description of REMI and data available and data you gathered.  When you refer to REMI in a 
source, include the version of the Model you used. Explain your choice of the variables clearly and how 
they reflect the policy initiatives. 
7.   Assumptions 
8.  Map(s) of the area 
9.  Results--carefully presented in figures/tables with appropriate titles, units of measure, years of 
coverage, and other relevant information, source and explained in the text, referring to the appropriate 
figure/table, when relevant. 
10. Conclusions 
11. References (include only the references you cite in the text.) 
12. A thank you to the BRA staff and others with whom you met. 

Let us know if you have any questions.
