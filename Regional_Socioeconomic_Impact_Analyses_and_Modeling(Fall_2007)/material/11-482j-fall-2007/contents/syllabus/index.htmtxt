***** Seminar Description *****
The seminar is designed to provide advanced graduate students with a thorough
understanding of selected regional economic theories and techniques and with
experience in using alternative socioeconomic impact assessment models and
related regional techniques on microcomputers. Discussions will be held on
particular theoretical modeling and economic issues; linkages among theories,
accounts, and policies; relationships between national and regional economic
structures; and methods of adjusting and estimating regional input-output
accounts and tables. Examples from the Boston area and other U.S. cities/
regions will be used to illustrate points throughout the seminar. We will also
examine how such models are used in other countries. New material on analyzing
regional development issues will be covered.
We will use a state-of-the-art regional microcomputer package, Regional
Economic Models, Inc. (REMI), by George I. Treyz. Regional analysts throughout
the United States make extensive use of this package.
Students will do three problem sets. During the first part of the seminar, we
will provide students with appropriate data for them to analyze and evaluate
the Massachusetts regional economy and to test the computer-software package.
During the last part of the seminar, students will extend their initial
analysis to assess socioeconomic impacts of Boston investment projects, the
exact projects to be selected by members of the class in collaboration with the
Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) staff. Students will give a formal
presentation to the BRA research staff at the end of the semester.
