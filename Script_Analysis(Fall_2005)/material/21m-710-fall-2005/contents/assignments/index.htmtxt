Many students find it helpful to refer to this general guide to analysis when
conducting a dramatic analysis of a script. ([This resource may not render
correctly in a screen reader.]PDF)
***** One Page Papers *****
Whether you act, direct or design, you have to know what a play is most
basically about. These one page papers foster that skill.
Students will write papers of not more than one page on A Doll's House, Hedda
Gabler, The Substance of Fire, Copenhagen, and Joe Turner's Come and Gone.
Directions for the One Page Papers (PDF)
***** Three-to-Four Page Papers *****
**** Doll's House Paper ****
A three-to-four page paper comparing the play and Joseph Losey's film of A
Doll's House will be required. This paper must be rewritten and resubmitted
after consultation with the instructor. Any or all of the other paper may also
be re-written and resubmitted.
Directions for the Doll's House paper ([This resource may not render correctly

**** Comparison of Greek and French Plays (Medea) ****
Although Euripides and Anouilh's versions ofMedea share the same basic story,
and even to some degree the same narrative and dramatic structure, there are
significant diferences between them. Those differences are the subject of your
essay.
Directions for the comparison paper. ([This resource may not render correctly

***** History of Private Life Presentation *****
Students must participate in an oral explication of important issues in chapter
2, volume 4, of A History of Private Life.

***** Final Presentation and Paper *****
Students will also complete a project analysing a play chosen from a short list
of plays by authors we have already studied in this course: The Piano Lesson by
August Wilson, The Good Person of Szechwan by Bertolt Brecht, and Democracy by
Michael Frayn. Results of the analysis are to be presented orally to the class,
and a summary paper, of at least ten pages and based on the analysis and
research, is to be handed in later. The paper should take into account
reactions to the oral presentation from students in the class and the
instructor. The topic for the presentation/paper is the answer to these
questions: What does the play mean? How does it mean it? In addition to
answering these questions, the paper should also include some discussion of the
consequences for production of the analysis, from the perspective of actor,
director or designer, according to the student's particular interests.

***** Comprehensive Summary Paper *****
Finally, students write a paper of about three pages, due at the end of the
course, that summarizes what each student has learned about reading a script
and describes a methodology the student has developed, based on the experience
of the course, for reading scripts theatrically and accurately.
