Democracy: Comments on the presentation by Susan Wilson. 

The long synopsis of the play you gave, and the confusions of the politics all have 
dramatic, not just historical, relevance. As do the loyalties and ever-shifting agendas of 
the politicians. Tracing how Wehner, for one, maneuvers through the play, as you did 
somewhat, really shows us the mine field that Guillaume has to thread his way though. 
And it is ironic how the smallest detail misinterpreted (one son instead of two) can trip up 
even these consummate politicians. Keep all of that material in mind as you deal with the 
play, realizing that what is being provided is the circumstances, the situations, for the 
drama, not the drama itself. 

You spoke about the flexibility and fluidity of identity in the play and "the 
difficulty of knowing the truth when it seems to be changing all the time." That's 
right, but again tie it to the drama that Guillaume is acting out.  Just keep in mind the 
event of the play, and the conflict that has led to the climax/event, and you'll be fine.
