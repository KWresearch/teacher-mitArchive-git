The Piano Lesson: Comments on the presentation by Hui Ying Wen 

An extremely intelligent approach to the play, especially in your attention to the 
symbolic elements. Many of the questions above you covered in detail. But I'd especially 
like to have you consider carefully who each of the men is and what each of them 
represents as a response to the problem of the African American in society after the 
emancipation. 

How are what you cited as the twin climaxes of the play, Boy Willie's fighting the 
ghost and Berniece's playing the piano related? Is one more important than the other? 
What is the problem each of them is trying to overcome in very different ways?
