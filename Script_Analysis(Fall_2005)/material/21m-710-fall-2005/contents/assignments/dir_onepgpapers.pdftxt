Directions for one page papers: 
Write an essay of no more than one page stating what you think the play is about. 
This does not mean re-telling the story/plot of the play. Rather, you are asked to 
write about what that story signifies, what idea or perception it illustrates, what is 
at the heart of the play. You will have to recount parts of the story to support 
your thesis, but do not waste precious space on extraneous details. 
Remember to confine yourself to one page only. The assignment asks you to 
think about essentials. From the definition of the most basic ideas flow all of the 
creative decisions about producing a play.
