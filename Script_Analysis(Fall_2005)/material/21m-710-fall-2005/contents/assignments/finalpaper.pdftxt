21M.710, SCRIPT ANALYSIS: Major Project  
 
Choose one of these three plays to work on: 
Michael Frayn, Democracy  
August Wilson, The Piano Lesson  
Berthold Brecht, The Good Person of Szechwan  
 

Make your choice after you have read all the plays. You are expected to have 
read all the plays. 
 

When you've chosen one play you feel comfortable with, read through it carefully 
several times, noting your impressions and using the guide I've given you to gather 
information, to categorize that information and to evaluate it. BE COMPREHENSIVE: 
make sure there is not the tiniest part of the play you have not considered; be sure of the 
smallest action, the function of the least important character, etc. Every "what" and 
"why" should be answered clearly. Then construct a coherent presentation of that material 
for the class, a presentation that explores and details what you have found the play to be 
about and that describes how you have arrived at your conclusions. Note any problems 
the play presents and indicate how you feel those problems are to be solved. The major 
topics of your presentation are to be what the play is about (that is, what it means) and 
how it means that. You should also discuss how the play as you conceive it should be 
realized on the stage and why. In other words, articulate your concept of the play and 
note some of the essential things that any production must do to present the play 
accurately. 
 

Your class presentation should run no longer than fifteen minutes. Be aware that, 
while you may repeat some information others who are working on the same play will 
give, your attack on the play is still your own, and you may choose to emphasize different 
things. Do not worry about repetition; be concerned only with making what you feel are 
the important points. Be sure to tell briefly the "story" of the play: you may be surprised 
to hear what others think the story is. There will be one class session devoted to each 
play, and you will perform on the day selected for the play you've chosen. Ideally there 
will be enough time after the individual presentations for some class discussion (since 
everyone in the class will be familiar with all the plays). 
 

You must also write an essay based on your investigation of the play and your 
class presentation. I will give you notes after your oral presentation about things I want 
you to consider and/or reconsider when you write the essay. The essay should be ten-to-
twelve pages in length.
