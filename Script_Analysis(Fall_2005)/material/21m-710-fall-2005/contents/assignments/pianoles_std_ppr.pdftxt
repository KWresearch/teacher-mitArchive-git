The Piano Lesson

The story of  The Piano Lesson  starts well before  the time  of the play.  Robert Sutter, a

slave-owner, exchanged  some  of his slaves  for a piano as an anniversary  present for his  wife.

When his wife  started missing the  exchanged slaves, he  asked Willie Boy, the husband  and

father of the  two exchanged  slaves, to  carve the  images of the slaves into the piano  for Mrs.

Sutter's sake.  However, Willie Boy went beyond  his orders  and covered the piano  with African-

style carvings of every member of  his family.  Years later, Willie Boy's grandsons, Boy  Charles,

Doaker, and Wining Boy,  stole the piano from  Sutter's house.  The incident  ended  in Boy

Charles being burned  to  death in a  boxcar while trying  to  escape, and he  and  those who died  with

him  were dubbed the  "Ghosts  of the  Yellow Dog."  From then on, the accidental  deaths of  slave-

owners were  attributed to  these "Ghosts."  Doaker  brought the piano with  him when he moved

North with  his niece, Berniece, and  her daughter, Maretha.  He works  as a railroad  cook, while

his  brother, Wining Boy, wanders the  country without  a permanent job  or home.  Bemiece's

husband,  Crawley, died  in  a conflict when he  stole some wood with Boy Willie  and Lymon

(Berniece's brother and his  friend) from a landowner.  The play begins with Boy Willie arriving

at Doaker's and Berniece's household, announcing the  death of Sutter and his plans  to  sell the

piano  in order to  buy  Sutter's land.  Two things  stand  in his way: Berniece's  refusal, and  Sutter's

ghost, which  haunts the piano  and is provoked by  Boy Willie's attempt to move  it out of the

house.  Another  important character  in the plot  is Avery,  a man who  wishes  to marry  Berniece.

There are several  strong symbols that  run throughout  the arc of the story.  The piano  and

the "Ghosts  of the Yellow Dog" play  key roles  from the very beginning  of the  story (before  the

time  of the play)  to  the very  last scene of the play.  They both  are symbols  of the family's  culture,

history,  and ancestry.  The piano has,  quite literally,  figures of their family members  carved  into

it, in an African  style that  had been passed  down to Willie Boy, even  in  slavery.  The Ghosts  of

the Yellow Dog take  the role of ancestors of the African American  slaves - they hold  special

significance for the  family in  the play,  as Boy  Charles is the prominent  figure  among the  Ghosts.

They are perceived  as protectors, to whom the deaths of overseers  and persecutors  (as well as the

demise of  Sutter's ghosts at  the end)  are attributed.  Sutter's ghost, which  plagues  the  household

and is  attached to the piano,  symbolizes the history  of slavery.  It is  an element  that haunts  the

family's past, which  the piano represents.  Slavery  is also a part of the past  that hinders  the

family from moving forward;  for instance, when Boy Charles, planning to  sell  the piano  to  gain

land to  farm,  tries to move  it out of the house, the ghost acts up.  The railroad  is another

recurring symbol; Boy  Charles  tried to flee via  the railroad, but met his death  there along  with

the other Ghosts of the  Yellow Dog, and Doaker,  the railroad  cook,  bases his world-weary  view

of life on his  observations on the railroad.  Hence,  the railroad represents  a conduit  for movement

through  life, be it used  for rash,  prudent, or simply aimless movement.

The ensemble  of characters  is the real engine of the play.  Primarily,  they  can be  divided

into two  groups: the  old generation, whose youths were  consumed by  slavery, and  the young

generation, who still has  the time  and  energy to  establish a new  life after slavery.  The brothers

Doaker  and Wining  Boy are  the old generation.  Wining Boy leads  a drifting life,  with no  secure

home or source  of financial  stability.  Doaker, on the other hand, has witnessed  the  drifting world

from his job  on the railroad,  and  is weary  of what he  sees.  He  seeks to  live  out the rest  of his

days in peace  and  harbors no  higher ambitions.

Berniece, Boy Willie, and Avery  are the main trio of the young  generation.  Newly freed

from slavery relatively  early in  life, each represents a  different way of creating  a life in  the

outside world.  Berniece  is paralyzed by and  avoids the pain of her family's  history  - she refuses

to  touch  the piano,  which was the cause of her father's death, and  keeps  it sitting like a

"gravestone"  in her  home.  Expending no efforts  on furthering her  own  life (she refuses  to come

out  of widowhood),  she focuses instead on the success of the next generation, represented  by

Maretha.  Avery's  method  is to  take to the white system  as much  as possible;  he  runs an elevator

in  a downtown  skyscraper  and wants to start his own church (August Wilson's view of religion

as a  lasting tool of enslavement  created by white men was explored  in Joe  Turner's  Come and

Gone).  In  contrast, Boy Willie's approach is fueled by an almost  reckless need for revenge.  He

wants to  own and profit  from the very land  that his family was enslaved  on, and  had probably

killed Sutter to  do so.  His mantra  of the "three-part payment"  for the land  is descriptive of his

self-destructive  mentality: he  is willing  to give of himself (his own savings),  demean  himself

(sell watermelons),  and  give up part  of his family's  culture and treasures  (the piano)  to  achieve

his goal.  In a way  similar  to how Berniece works with Maretha, Boy Willie  also has  a partner.

However, his partner  is not  a  son or daughter, but Lymon - a companion who shares his  energy

and youthful daring.

Another pattern  among the characters consists of the men  in the family.  All  have

committed  some act  of revenge against their  enslavers or persecutors: Willie Boy  had  carved the

entire family  into the piano, Doaker, Wining Boy, and Boy Charles  stole the piano,  and Crawley

brought a  gun with  him in  anticipation of  a conflict with  some white  men when  he, Boy Willie,

and Lymon were  stealing wood from a  landowner.  In  fact, Boy Willie is currently  committing

an act of revenge  by buying  Sutter's land.  All  of these actions were  not  completely prudent,  and

some men paid with  their lives.  It  is Berniece, a woman, who breaks  this  ineffective male

pattern by  accomplishing  a true success at  the end of the play.

Wilson's  structure  of the play  is fairly straightforward,  leading  us through  the  story while

incorporating  character exploration.  Act  1, Scene 1 sets up the situation with Boy Willie's

entrance and  announcement  of Sutter's death and his plans  to  sell the piano.  As if we too,  like

Boy Willie,  had just  arrived at  the household, we are  introduced to the  cast of characters.  The

conflict between Bemiece  and Boy Willie is instigated.  In the next scene between  Doaker  and

Wining Boy, the old  generation, we learn the history of the family,  the piano, and the  Ghosts  of

Yellow Dog.  In preparation  for the second half of the play and  as a  summation  of the play's

central conflict, Act  1 ends with  a short articulation of the argument  between  Berniece and Boy

Willie and  an appearance  of Sutter's ghost.

The first three  scenes of Act 2 work  together to  explore the  theme  of romantic

relationships  between men and women.  The first two scenes demonstrate  ineffective  and  even

immature attitudes  towards  romantic relationships.  In Scene  1, Wining  Boy tries  to  sell a  suit to

Lymon as a tool for  going out  into town and "getting women"  (the character  of  Grace appears  as

a result of Boy Willie's  and Lymon's night out).  In the next scene, Berniece and Avery  hold  an

unsuccessful  conversation  about marriage;  she holds an  unhealthy  reluctance  towards moving  on

after Crawley's death,  and he puts forth very  disparaging and  selfish  arguments for their

marriage.  In  a heartwarming  conclusion to  this  sub-theme, however,  Scene 3 brings Bemiece

and Lymon  together,  each from  one of the  two previous  scenes.  They hold  a  frank and open

discussion about  their places  in life, romantic and otherwise, and what Lymon  truly  desires in  a

relationship.  This  develops  into an attraction between the  two, probably  the first romance

Berniece has had  during her  self-imposed widowhood.  The conflict over the piano comes  to  a

head and is resolved  in  the  last two  scenes - which brings us  to  the meaning  of the play.

Plotwise,  the central conflict of the play  is between Bemiece  and Boy Willie  over what  to

do with the piano.  Thematically,  since the piano symbolizes their  family history  and  culture and

both Bemiece  and Boy Willie are of the "young generation,"  the conflict  is over  how to  deal with

their familial  and cultural past in  their current endeavors  to establish  a life  after  slavery.

Bemiece views  the past as a  painful history to be  suppressed  in order  for the next  generation  to

rise up, yet  it is a past  that must not  be forgotten, for  it contains losses near  and  dear to  her.  This

explains why she does not tell Maretha about the piano's history, yet  is adamant  about keeping  it

in her  home although  she refuses to touch  it.  Boy Willie, on the other hand,  holds  much  less

reverence towards  the piano  and wants to  sell it to buy  Sutter's land; he  holds no sentiments

towards  objects of familial  and cultural significance, and  is willing  to  exploit  or use them  as

stepping-stones to  gain  treasures  that are more pertinent  to  his present  life,  such as land  to  farm.

The disagreement between  these two points  of view create  a constant thread-line  of discontent

running  throughout  the play.

Wilson crafts  the climax as a wonderful physical manifestation  of the different ways  that

the young  generation - Berniece, Boy Willie, and Avery - tries  to  subdue the  lingering  ghost  of

slavery in  order to move  on.  Sutter's ghost is roused by Boy Willie's final  attempt to move the

piano out  of the  house.  First, Avery tries  to exorcise the piano using religion,  which  comes from

his belief  in  success by  adapting to  the "white man's" system.  He fails, however.  Next, Boy

Willie, outraged, engages  the ghost in a physical  wrestling match.  This  is very  indicative  of his

reckless, vengeful  nature and no-holds-barred approach to  success, which  characterizes  his

eagerness to  sell a family heirloom  for a purchase  that not  only advances  him financially,  but

also serves the side purpose  of revenge for the past.  He too  fails.  Finally, Bemiece  plays the

piano, for the first time  in years,  and sings a song calling upon Boy  Charles and  her  female

ancestors for  help.  The  Ghosts of the Yellow Dog arrive,  indicated by the sound  of a train, and

drive Sutter's ghost out.  What Berniece has done is to  undo her  suppression of the past  and  call

upon her ancestors and  family culture,  symbolized by the Ghosts  of the Yellow  and the piano

respectively, for help in the struggle against the ghost of slavery.  Needless  to  say, the  earlier

conflict between Berniece and Boy Willie over  the use  of the piano  is resolved.  Although

Berniece's original insistence  on suppressing  the past has  not won out,  she wins  by discovering

in the end the most potent way that  the piano, or the power of the family's history  and culture,

should  be  utilized.

It  is interesting to note  that the play's climax does not  result directly from  the conflict.  In

other words, why is the  climax not  a fight between Berniece and Boy Willie  over the piano,  since

that is the conflict?  Instead, Wilson structures the climax as a  conflict between  the  ghost and  the

three members  of the young  generation.  This calls emphasis  to the  fact that the play's  conflict is

not a personal one  between Berniece and Boy Willie, but  that the conflict  is between  what  the

two siblings represent  - their different  attitudes towards  dealing with  the past  and  how to  best

continue with the future.  Structurally, this  does not present any  ambiguities,  as the conflict

between Berniece and Boy Willie  is incontestably  resolved by the climax.

Ultimately,  The Piano Lesson  is about the different ways  Blacks try to  shake  off the

shadow of slavery and establish a new  life afterwards, and Wilson clearly  indicates  which

method he believes works.  That would be Berniece's newfound method,  discovered  during the

pressure of the play's climax, which  is to use  one's family culture  and  history  as a foundation,  a

source of  strength, for  exorcising the "ghost"  of slavery and  building a  new life.  Neither  Avery's

method of trying  to  fit into the "white man's" system, Willie Boy's impulse to  exploit  the family's

accumulated heritage for revenge  and immediate needs, nor Berniece's  original suppression of

the past  are successful.  Wilson also shows the fate of Blacks who are unable to  even  attempt

what the young generation of the play  is trying to do.  His example  characters are Doaker  and

Wining Boy, who end up either waiting out their  days devoid of higher ambitions,  or wander  the

world, rootless, because  their lives were so  taken up by slavery  that there  is no time  or energy

left  to  carve  out  a new  life.

A secondary theme,  to which  a major portion of the play  is devoted  nonetheless,  is the

general  subject of men  and women.  Before Berniece's climactic action,  there  was a  general

pattern, running  through the family,  of men committing acts of revenge  against  enslavers and

oftentimes perishing  for it, leaving the women to mourn.  Berniece's feat  was not  an act  of

revenge, hence she suffered  no consequences for it.  However, the success  of her  act is a  strong

statement on the potency of maternal wisdom passed  down a family  line, and  this  feminine

aspect is emphasized by the  fact that Berniece mainly calls upon  her female  ancestors  in  her

song.  There is also significance to  the fact that Berniece has a daughter,  not  a son,  to  carry out

the task  of creating a life after  slavery.  This theme  of the differences  between  men and women

even appears to  extend to Grace.  Despite playing the role of a random  woman  picked up  by Boy

Willie, she exhibits a  degree of dignity and maturity.  When Berniece  tells her  and Boy Willie to

get out  of the house,  Grace quickly complies  and states her reluctance  to  intrude  in a household

in which  she isn't welcome.  This  suggests a lack of pretension as to  how she  is perceived by

Berniece and by society.

A related  issue the play deals with is that  of male/female  romantic  relationships.  In  fact,

the first three scenes  of Act  2 is  a self-contained discussion  on this  subject, depicting  the

immature male view  towards women,  a widow's unhealthy reluctance to move  on, a man's old-

fashioned and  sexist views of marriage, and  finally a  genuine romantic encounter  founded  on

honest  dialogue and mature assessments  of love.  The  importance of having a  relationship  is  also

stressed, as Berniece's paralysis  in life, triggered  by the painful  past  of slavery,  is linked to  her

paralysis  in her love  life.  Likewise, Wining Boy's unstable relationships  and fleeting romantic

affairs  is symptomatic of his drifting  lifestyle.  It  is unsurprising that marriage  and  relationships

are granted such a key  focus in this play,  given the  importance Wilson places  on  the continuation

of family,  and hence the creation of new generations.

As  for the merits of this play,  there  seems to be  an imbalance  between  how the play  is  set

up, and how it ends.  All along,  the play runs mainly  on the  interactions between  men - Doaker,

and Wining Boy, and Boy Willie and Lymon.  Also,  the active players  in  the family's history

comprise almost exclusively of men.  Throughout  the course of the play, Berniece  is called upon

only as needed in  her role as Boy Willie's adversary.  Therefore,  her  central role  in the play's

climax and  resolution is  surprising, and seems to  lack a  setup.  She is the  character who

undergoes the most major  change over the course  of the play, yet her  development  is not

documented and seems to  occur  in the blink of an eye during the climax.  On  the other hand,  as

mentioned before,  the contrast between the actions  of the men  in Berniece's ancestry  and her

final salvation of the family  is certainly effective, as far  as the  theme  about  the  differences

between men and women  is used in the play.

A production of this play  must be  aware that the characters  are probably  the most

important element of this play.  They are  the physical  embodiments  of the  themes,  and the

vehicles by which those  themes  are played  against each other.  Hence,  it would help  if the

characters are visually  distinct, whether  in  looks or costume.  First, there  should  be a distinction

between the old and young  generations.  Doaker  and Wining Boy should  look  distinct  from

Bemiece,  Boy Willie, and Avery,  possibly by looking more faded,  less vibrant.  There  are

differences within each  generation as well.  Wining Boy  shows signs of his  traveling  lifestyle

and lack of financial stability, while Doaker  looks more "kept"  and settled.

The differences  should be more pronounced within the young generation,  as the  themes

of this  generation are given the prominent  play  in this play.  Berniece  deliberately  imposes  upon

herself  the  look of a widow, and her reluctance  to  attract men or forge  a way  in the outside  world

shows itself in her  carefully controlled,  subdued dress.  In contrast, Boy Willie, though

technically an  adult, still bears the vestiges of a  reckless youth,  and  there may  even be  some

aggression in his look  that supports the  implication that  he murdered  Sutter in  order to  carry out

his revengeful purchase.  Finally, every detail of Avery's dress,  look, and  even manner  testifies  to

his desire to move up in the  "white man's"  world.  Maretha and Lymon have  their  connections  to

this generation as well.  Maretha  is a vision  of what Berniece believes will help  a woman  take  a

place in the world  (there are textual  clues, such as Bemiece  enrolling Maretha  in piano lessons,

straightening her  hair, and  admonishing her to  be a  properly behaved young  woman).  In the

same manner,  Lymon shares some of  Boy Willie's youth  and  daring, yet  instances  in the script

point to  a greater  degree of maturity  in Lymon, such as his  plan  to stay  up North  to make  his

fortune, and his romantic scene with Berniece.  Therefore, while Lymon  should share Boy

Willie's look, he  retains a bit more maturity.

Finally, in order  for the central meaning of the play  to  come across, the  climax should  be

staged, as clearly as possible,  as a battle  in which Berniece, Boy Willie,  and Avery  are  the chief

"contestants,"  each with  equal yet strongly  distinct roles.  Doaker, Wining Boy,  and whoever

else may be  onstage at  the time  should fade  into the background.  This  is to emphasize,  as much

as possible, that this  battle  is a  test of the methods by which  the young  generation attempt to

overpower the ghost  of slavery, with Berniece's newfound method finally  emerging  as the clear

victor.  The  last scene of the play requires  special care  in staging, not  only because  it contains the

climax and resolution, but  because it delivers the ultimate message of the play.
