The Piano Lesson: General comments on the presentations as a whole. 

There are a few major issues that have to be dealt with carefully, and, I think, 
critically. (I want you, incidentally, to assess how well you think the play accomplishes 
whatever you think it sets out to do and how well it works as a play and as a unified 
narrative.) The play sets up a number of oppositions and they all have to be explored and 
the interactions between those oppositions clarified. 

One is between whites and blacks and their history together, specifically the 
Sutters and the family of Berniece and Boy Willie. Clearly at the heart of this opposition 
the is slavery, emancipation and subsequent history. In the long narratives of the first and 
second act, what do all the characters reveal about how the African-Americans have dealt 
over the generations with their "freedom"? And "over the generations" is important. How 
far has each generation moved? Where are Boy Willie and the others now? Where 
"ought" they to be? How have they progressed? What is the importance of the event that 
sets off the action of the play, Sutter's dying and Boy Willie's wanting to buy his land? 
When Boy Willie wrestles with the ghost of Sutter in the last scene, why is it Sutter's 
ghost he wrestles with? 

And what about the "opposition" of generations in the play? How do Boy Willie 
and the men in his generation compare to men of the previous generation, represented by 
Wining Boy and Doaker? Especially in terms of managing their lives and assimilation 
and progress? And how about Berniece and Mama Ola and Maretha as representatives of 
three generations? So much is made of the history of the family in The Piano Lesson. 
Why? 

And there is the "opposition" of men and women. How differently have they 
handled their common problems? At the center of this opposition are Boy Willie and 
Berniece. What does each want? What does the piano represent to each of them and why 
do they feel about it as they do? What does Wilson mean by ending the play with Boy 
Willie wrestling the ghost of Sutter and Berniece playing the piano simultaneously? And 
which is the more significant act? If most of the play is taken up with the men talking 
about themselves to each other, where does Berniece fit in and why is she at the center of 
the story and why is her playing the piano so important? 

Each of the men is different from the others. How do they represent a sort of 
cross-section of African American men? And what is the response of each of them to the 
situation that African Americans find themselves in? For example, how do Avery, Boy 
Willie and Lymon each deal with essentially the same problem? 

What does Boy Willie want to achieve by buying Sutter's land? 

What's Berniece's story? Why the "paralysis" after Crawley's death? (And why 
does Lymon, not Avery, almost get her out of it?) Why won't she play the piano and 
when she does, what does it mean? 

What is the story of the play in the simplest terms? What happens? The climax? 
How well does the play prepare for that particular climax? How much of the play is 
extraneous to it? 

The play is called The Piano Lesson. A lesson means that someone is learning 
something. Who learns what? And then, finally, the question is how focused the play is 
on this simple story? What about the ghostly (non-realistic) intrusion into a realistic play? 
How successful is the play?
