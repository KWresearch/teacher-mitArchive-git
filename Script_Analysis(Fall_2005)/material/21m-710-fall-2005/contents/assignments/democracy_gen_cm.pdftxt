Democracy: General comments on the presentations as a whole. 

I think the danger when confronting this play is to be overwhelmed by the 
historical material and begin to treat it like an intellectual construct and not a 
play. It is necessary to acknowledge the political situation, and its incredible 
complexity, and to understand that that is the wellspring from which the play 
arises. But it is a play; consequently, the principal questions are who's the play 
about, primarily, and what is the event of the play. 

As you write your paper, make sure you keep in mind what is foreground, what 
background. Frayn is not writing a political history. The play is about the people make 
the politics and the history, and the people who are then caught in what is made. 

No matter how much material Frayn puts in about the political situation, doesn't 
all that material serve to provide the circumstances, and the pressures, 
surrounding the relationship of Guillaume and Brandt? The play, it seems to me, 
does focus on that personal relationship, but more particularly on Guillaume and 
what becomes for him a dilemma. I wonder if it isn't really his play. He may be a 
representative of East Germany, and a spy, but he is first and foremost a man, a 
man increasingly caught in a problem. And while his career as Prime Minister 
may be over after Guillaume is discovered to be a spy, Brandt, as we are told near 
the end of the play, is later rehabilitated as an elder statesman. There is nothing 
similar for Guillaume: his life is effectively over when his cover is blown and he is 
discovered to be a spy. His career/life is destroyed by the events in the play, 
which spawn the problem he faces. And what constitutes that problem? 

Isn't he caught between his growing admiration/affection for Brandt and his job 
as a spy? Isn't it the conflict between the personal and the public/political? No 
one else. Certainly not Brandt, has a similar dilemma. And I think the fact that 
Guillaume has to talk to the two sides in ways that at times seem almost 
simultaneous underlines the real difficulty. How often, when you look at the text, 
are you initially uncertain to whom he is speaking? And then, how much of your 
uncertainty mimics the situation Guillaume finds himself in? The life-and-death 
necessity always to know to whom you are speaking and what therefore you can 
or should be saying is the frightening burden of Guillaume's life. And when it is 
compromised by feelings of affection and admiration for Brandt...? 

But then, who is Brandt? And is he ever as interested in Guillaume as Guillaume 
is in him? Brandt is a chameleon. He always has to decide which of the many 
possibilities of personality he should show to the world and how that is 
dependent on his assessment of what is important at the moment in the complex 
world in which he is playing. But what does all this mean for Guillaume? 

Some of you spoke about the complex political climate of the play, especially the 
changeable coalitions, political, administrative and personal. The shifting sands 
of politics. What is the function of the political background, the complexities and 

the maneuverings of the characters and relationships? Why are they so much a 
part of the play? Don't they let us see how unstable the political world is, how 
changeable and unpredictable, and consequently how sure-footed anyone who 
navigates this world has to be? That is a statement about the world of the 
characters and the play, but it also emphasizes how difficult is Guillaume's job. 
Finally, there are some things he cannot control or adjust and he's doomed. It 
would be good to think about who all the characters are in particular and what 
function they play. Do not assume that the only reason they are in the play is 
because they are part of history. Note the changing ideals and changing 
allegiances AND the difference between what is going on in public and under the 
table; again, that makes the job difficult for Guillaume, especially as he comes to 
admire Brandt. Trying to do your job is infinitely harder when you can never be 
sure of where your colleagues stand, never sure who might have knowledge you 
don't have and need to survive - and when your feelings get in the way. 

And don't forget there is a real "thriller" aspect to the play. It is a spy drama.
