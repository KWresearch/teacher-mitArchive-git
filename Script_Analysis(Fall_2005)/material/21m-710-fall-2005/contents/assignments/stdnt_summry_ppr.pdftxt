John  Gardner
21M.710:  Script Analysis
Summary Paper

There  are several different things  I learned about reading  scripts  this  semester.  I

think that the way I look  at a script  is more focused.  I remember when  we  first  discussed

A Doll's  House you  asked us  to  summarize what the play means  in  one sentence.  This

was hard  for all of us, but  then you were  easily able to  state it concisely  in  one statement.

I  feel that before  this  class I would look  at a script and  see different  themes  and  ideas, but

the  ideas were never focused  or clear.  It  is difficult  to  summarize a play's meaning  in a

single statement, but  it is important to  get  that focus and  cut out  all the  extraneous

thoughts.

To  get this  kind  of focus, one has  to evaluate how all the aspects  of a play come

together.  I do not think I ever  thought about  this  before.  The characters,  setting,  plot,

relationships,  symbolism all seemed very  disjoint.  However,  over the  semester I feel  that

we  learned how all these different aspects work  together to  focus  on one meaning.  We

certainly  discussed all of these aspects over the course  of the  semester  and we had  to

consider all of them for  our final analysis presentation and paper.

The  way I look  at a  script, the way I analyzed Democracy  for  my  final paper and

presentation, was  to  start with the plot.  We did this the very  first  day with A Doll's

House.  The first thing  you did was  to  ask us to  outline  the plot,  exactly what  happened

starting in the past before  the play even  starts.  I think that  it is important to  start with the

plot first because it is the framework  in which  everything happens.

Next, I would  look  at the characters.  I would  see what  each one was  like, what

they did  in the play,  and most  importantly what their  function was  in the play.  I think

that it was easiest to  see what  the main characters were  doing  in a play  because

everything is focused  on them.  I think that  it was much harder  to  find the  purpose  in

secondary characters.  For example,  in A Doll 's House I did not  initially  see how certain

characters were  used to mirror  the main  characters and their  relationship.  I think that this

kind of function  is more subtle, which is why  it is more difficult  to  pick up  on, but  I think

that  it makes  the playwright's meaning much more clear  and specific.

From here I think it is important to think about  themes  within a play  and  focus

these down  to  concise idea about what  the play is  about.  The  aspects of a play  in which

the  themes are strongest  changes from play to play.  Some plays  have deep  symbolism in

certain props,  such as Hedda  Gabler, Piano Lesson,  and Substance  of Fire.  I think others

have  the  themes in the relationships  and characters, such as A Doll's  House, Copenhagen,

and Democracy.  Certainly plays  have themes that  are supported  by an  assortment  of

aspects, but  I think  there are certain aspects which  are more  important  than others  in a

specific play.  Once  I look at  these different parts  of  a play, what the play  is  about

becomes much  clearer and I  continue to refine my  thoughts  until what  the play  is  about

can be  stated in  a sentence.

One important consequence  of this type  of framework  is evaluating  a play's

effectiveness or success.  I  never before really  thought about a play's  success in  terms of

its construction,  rather  more about whether I liked  it or not.  I like plays  that  have a  less

conventional structure,  but I never  thought about  the purpose  of that structure  beyond  the

fact that it was  interesting.  I never  thought that maybe  such a play  was so unfocused  that

it did not  have a meaning.  I think that I learned  about  this when  we studied Democracy.

It  had a very  non-linear  structure where  the meeting of Heisenburg  and Bohr was

replayed multiple  times.  However, this  structure was essential  to the play's  main idea of

uncertainty.  I remember we  read a  play which you handed  out to us just  before  we

looked at Copenhagen which was about Oppenhiemer  and the bomb.  We decided  that

though  it had  some interesting  ideas and  themes, but it never really  connected;  it was not

a unified  play.

There  were  a few parts  of the course which I  found to be most  important to my

learning, most  of which you probably gathered  from what  I said  above.  First,  we spent  a

long time  on A Doll 's House, but I think that  it was  important  to  do the first  play  in  such

depth because it set the  tone  for the rest  of the course and really  established  the

foundations on which  to  analyze a script.  Second, I really  enjoyed  Copenhagen because

it was a very  interesting and fun play  to  read, but also  because it is different  then the

other plays we read.  It has a  very unique structure and  I found  it very  profound  to  see the

purpose behind this  structural  choice.  I  also personally  feel that  Copenhagen was  the

most well  constructed plays we read  in that it had unity;  it was  a cohesive  whole, which I

found very  elegant.  Third,  the final presentation and paper  are essential  because  we have

to  do all the analysis  our self instead  of depending on you for  all the connections  and

meanings.
