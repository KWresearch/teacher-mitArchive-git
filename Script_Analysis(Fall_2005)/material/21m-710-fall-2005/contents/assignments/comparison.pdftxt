Direction for comparison of Greek and French plays (Medea): 
Though these two plays share the same basic stories, even to some degree the 
same narrative and dramatic structure, there are significant differences between 
them. Those differences are the subject of your essay of three-to-four pages. Do 
not be concerned with what, for this assignment, are superficial differences that 
come from the conventions of fifth century Athenian theater and mid-twentieth 
century French theater. You are to concentrate on what the attitude of each 
playwright is to the events and characters of the story and how those respective 
attitudes are revealed in the treatment of events and characters. What does the 
story signify to each playwright? How do you know? What is at the heart of each 
play?
