The Questfor Identity in MichaelFrayn's Democracy

Michael Frayn's Democracystruggles with  presenting  the  human  drama  of

Ginter  Guillaume  amidst  the  chaotic  backdrop  of  post-WWII Germany;  while

attempting  to dramatize  the  internal  conflict of a man  placed  in  a  situation  where  he

was  required  to  spy  on  a  man  he  deeply  admired,  it  does  not  fully  succeed  in

clarifying  that  focus. The  play  endeavors  to  illustrate  the  personal  and  political

challenges  Guillaume  faces in  his  role  as  a  spy:  the  conflict  between  his  competing

and  opposite  alliances,  the  challenge  of living  a  double  life,  the  confusion  of being

caught  between  two  entirely  different  worlds  and  trying  to  reconcile his  place in both

of them. The personal and intensely human  drama gets bogged  down, however, in

the  setting,  as  Frayn  is unable  to  fully  explore  (to a  degree  of  satisfaction)  several  of

the  introduced  themes  and  in  the  structure  itself, as  he  distances  the  audience  from

the  action  at  hand  and  never  truly  delves  into  the  interior  lives  of  the  most  critical

characters.

Democracy, at  its core,  is  the  story  of  a spy.  Guillaume  is  an  agent  planted  in

the  lower  rungs  of West  Germany's  Social  Democratic  Party  by  the  Stasi  (the East

German  Ministry  of  State  Security). William  Brandt  is  elected  as  Chancellor  of  the

German  Federal  Republic, and  as  he  rises, so too does Guillaume;  he  is promoted  to  a

new  post  in  the  chancellor's  office, much  to  the  delight  (and  surprise)  of  his  Stasi

contact,  Arno  Kretschmann.  Using  his  position  in  the  SDP  to  spy  for  East Germany,

1

however,  seems  counterproductive,  as  Brandt  is  the  first  leader  of  the  Federal

Republic  to honestly  attempt  to  forge  a mutually  beneficial,  united  relationship  with

East  Germany;  he  is  far  more  an  ally  to  East  Germany  than  an  enemy  worthy  of

being  the  target  of  such  self-preserving  espionage.  The  historically  convoluted

motives  of  the  Stasi,  however,  mirror  the  conflict  within  Guillaume  himself;  as  he

becomes  closer  to Brandt,  he  is forced  to weight  his  increasing  responsibilities  to his

home  country  (since the  more  intimate  his  relationship  with  Brandt,  the  greater  his

access to  sensitive documents  and  communiques) against  his  growing  admiration

and  respect for  the man  he  is supposed  to be spying  on.

The  play  is  structured  around  the  parallel  careers  of Guillaume  and  Brandt;

the  first  act  follows  Brandt's  rise  to  chancellor  and  Guillaume's  rise  to  Brandt's

personal  assistant  while  the  second  act  charts  the  public  revelation  of Guillaume's

role as  a  spy  and  Brandt's  virtually  simultaneous  fall from  power.  The  format  of the

play  is  comprised  of  various  personal  reflections,  occasional  dialogue,  and  periodic

bursts  of  narrative;  there  is  practically  no  direct  conflict  or  confrontation  between

characters.  The bulk  of the  story  development  inherent  in  this  spy  drama  is revealed

through  speeches  removed  from  the  action  rather  than  the  actual  playing-out  of  the

events  at  hand.  Many  aspects  of the  unfurling  drama  within  Brandt's  political cadre

and  Guillaume's  growing  internal  conflict are  revealed  during  Guillaume's  reports  to

Kretschmann  or  a reflective  soliloquy  from Guillaume  or  Brandt  (although  speeches

from Brandt  that  actually  offer meaningful  insight  into  the  inner  workings  of himself

and  his  world  are  rarer).  By letting  the  story  play  out  indirectly,  as  filtered  through

2

other  parties  separated  from the  action, Frayn toys with  the  traditional  format  of

dramatization;  the meat  of the  play  lies not  in what  is  actually  happening,  but  in  the

characters' responses to  their  environment and  their  own internal machinations. It

makes  it  less  clear what  exactly  is being  dramatized,  since  so little  action  truly  takes

place onstage,  but  in  focusing  on  reaction  over  action  Frayn  highlights  the  emotional

and  highly  personal  aspects  of this  otherwise  complicated,  convoluted  historical  spy

thriller.

This  lack  of concentration  on  traditional  dramatic  action  places  responsibility

for  the  plot  and  thematic  development  on  the  characters  themselves.  The  protean,

inconstant nature of politics is illustrated most noticeably through  tracing the paths

several  of the  secondary  characters  travel  throughout  the  play; while  they  bear  little

direct  influence  on  the  action  of the  play,  as their  role  in  the  drama  is not  played  out

in  the  text but  rather  referred  to,  they  provide  a clearer  image  of the  world  in which

Guillaume  is  attempting  to  navigate.  Herbert  Wehner,  the  party  leader,  arranged  in

1966 (with  Helmut  Schmidt)  a  coalition between  the  Christian  Democratic  and

Christian  Social Unions  and  the  Social Democratic  Party  while  Brandt  was  detained

in  transit  only  to have  Brandt  seize  the  opportunity  to  form  a  coalition  with  the  Free

Democratic Party  in 1969 against Wehner and  Schmidt's wishes  and then  run  for

chancellor  without  telling  either  of them.  Throughout  the  course  of the  play  Wehner

is forced  to  act  as  though  he  supports  Brandt  while  internally  resenting  him  for his

individual  rise  to power  while Wehner  stays  in the  same  position.  While Wehner  and

Brandt  should  be  on  the  same  side,  Wehner  consistently  undermines  him  to  other

.3

people  and  disrupts  the  natural  chain  of command  by  hijacking  Gunther  Nollau  (the

head  of West German  Security) who now  reports  secretly to  him  rather  than  his

official superior.  When  Brandt  sends  Wehner  and  Schmidt  a  letter  about  party

reorganizations,  Wehner  ignores  its  contents  and  executes  his  own  reorganization

(namely,  demoting  his rival  to Brandt's affection and  party  power,  Horst  Ehmke  to  a

trivial  station  in  the  post  office); soon  after Wehner  is heard  griping  about  how  well

things  used  to be  run  when  Ehmke was  still  in  charge. Wehner,  throughout  virtually

the  entire  play,  toys  with  his  inside  knowledge  of  the  potential  sleeper  in  their

department;  he chooses  not  to make  Brandt  aware  of it until  exceptionally  late  in  the

game  because  he  doesn't  want  to  risk  being wrong  and  looking  incredibly  foolish,

but  if  he doesn't  tell and  it  ends up  being  true,  he would  appear  to  be almost  as

treacherous  and  complicit  as  the  spy  himself.  Wehner  consistently  plays  the  role  of

whichever  character  might  benefit  him  the  most  in  any  given  situation;  even  within

their  own  party,  alliances are shifting  and  no  one is fully as they  seem. Guillaume  not

only  has  to  rationalize  his  roles  in  the  disparate  realms  of East  and  West  Germany

but  even within  the  party  itself. There  is no  constancy,  no  clear  reality,  as everyone  is

hidden  from  one  another  by layers  and  layers  of subterfuge  and  superficiality;  since

everyone  is  manipulating  the  system,  it  is  incredibly  difficult  for  any  character  to

truly  know  where  he  stands  in  the world,  and  clearly  even  more  of a  challenge  for

Guillaume, who  is forced  to play  innumerable  roles  in  a world  where  he can  never  be

certain  if his  cover  is about  to be blown;  the  instability  inherent  in his  role  as a  spy  is

4

magnified  tenfold  by  the  instability  within  the  framework  he  is  infiltrating,  further

complicating  his already  complex situation.

The  most  critical  complication  for  Guillaume,  however,  is  not  the  shifting

nature  of  the  political  machine  but  his  own  variable  and  conflicting  loyalties.  In

Wehner's  ideal party,  there  are  "no  roots  and  no  loyalties.  A party  has  members  and

funds,  offices and  officers, patronage  and  punishment."  1 But this  is not  the  case for

Guillaume;  he  is increasingly  torn  between  his  loyalty  to his  country  and  his  love for

Brandt.  He  is  put  in  a  position  where  he must  constantly  reassess  his  motivation;  is

the  East  German  cause  worth  jeopardizing 

the  career  of  a  man  he  respects  and

admires?  How  can  he  serve  both  masters  without  compromising  his  devotion  to

either  cause?  One  of  the  failings  of  the  play  is  the  lack  of  exploration  of  either  the

reason  for  Guillaume's  incredible  dedication  to  Brandt  or  his  motives  for  becoming

an  East German  spy  in  the  first  place. There  is very  little  attention  given  to Brandt's

character,  and  while  other  characters  speak  of his  extraordinary  charisma  (especially

when  relating  the  tales  of  his  winning  over  entire  crowds  with  a  single  wordless

gesture),  little  direct  evidence  of it is provided  in  the  play,  which makes  it difficult  to

understand  Guillaume's  attachment.  There  is  also  practically  no  discussion  of what

led  Guillaume  to  become  a  spy,  so  his  incentive  for  embarking  on  this  mission  is

never  explored  beyond  a  basic  assumed  allegiance  to  his  native  country.  Truly

incredibly  tenuous,  challenging  position  is made  far  more  difficult  as  his motivation

is not  fully explored  in the  actual  text of the  play and  must  instead  be  inferred.

The  inherent  challenge  of reconciling  warring  parts  of one's self epitomized  in

Guillaume's  struggle with  his  allegiances  is also  relevant  to  the  play's  discussion  of

power,  leadership,  and  democracy  as  a whole.  The difficulty  in  ruling  a nation  lies  in

reconciling  the  conflicting desires  of each individual  party,  each individual  person;  is

it  even  possible  to  act  in  the  interests  of  the  country  as  a  whole,  when  indubitably

some  segments  are  not  being  served  by  a  particular  decision?  For  a  nation  is  as

divided  and  contradictory  as  is  any  character in  the  play,  and  consequently  the

leadership  of a nation  is intrinsically  only going  to placate  a  fraction  of the  populace

while  the  remainder  attempts  to curry  favor  back in  their  direction.  The changeability

and  manipulation  so present  within Brandt's own  party  is  equally present  in  the

workings  of the  nation  at  large. Kretschmann  describes  the Federal  Republic  as:

Not  just  one  so-called  democracy  -eleven  separate  democracies  tied  up  in  a
federation  like ferrets  in  a bag! Eleven separate  talking-shops  all  talking  at  the
same  time,  with  the  Federal  talking-shop  in Bonn  trying  to make  itself  heard
above  the  rest  of  them!  Three  political  parties,  in  and  out  of  bed  with  each
other  like  drunken  intellectuals,  fifteen  warring  Cabinet  Ministers  in  Bonn
alone,  and  sixty million  separate  egos.  All making  deals  with  each  other  and
breaking  them.  All looking  round  at  every  moment  to  see  the  expression  on
everyone  else's  face. All trying  to  guess  which  way  everyone  else  will  jump.
All  out  for  themselves,  and  all  totally  dependent  on  everyone  else.  Not  one
Germany.  Sixty million  separate  Germanies.

Just  as  Guillaume 

is  struggling  with  his  conflicting  desires,  just  as  the  Social

Democratic  Party  is  struggling  with  its  balance  of  power,  so  too  is  Germany's

democracy  struggling  to  reconcile the  respective  needs  and  shifting  allegiances  of its

sixty million distinct  citizens.

At the  core of Democracyis the  eternal  drama  of identity,  of  discovering  how

the many  disparate  and  contradictory  characteristics  within  all  of us  can  coexist  and

which  of  them  truly  define  who  we  are  and  how  we  interact  with  the  world.

Guillaume  is forced  to  rationalize  his  opposing  loves  for  Brandt  and  East  Germany,

and  in  doing  so  must  somehow  simultaneously  mask  sides  of  himself  and

continually  change  his  external  self based  on  the  new  context  he  finds  himself  in.  In

order  for him  to  exist in  Brandt's  world while  acting  on  the  orders  of Kretschmann's

world  Guillaume  has  to come  to  terms with  the  contradictions  of his loyalties  and  the

coexistence  of seemingly  incompatible  character  traits.  Brandt,  while  discussing  his

own  identity  crisis, describes  the  composition  of the inner  self:

So many  people,  with  so many  different  views  and  so  many  different  voices.
And  inside  each  of  us  so  many  more  people  still,  all  struggling  to  be heard.
For  a moment  one  voice  rises  above  the  others,  and  everyone  picks  up  the
tune.  And  then  the  cacophony  resumes.  Until  sooner  or  later  another  voice  is
raised...

p.86

So many selves exist simultaneouslywithin us  and we simply rotate through

which  self  is  dominant  at  any  given  moment  based  on  the  situation.  The  few

moments  in  the  play  where  Brandt says anything  of  sincere meaning  and  depth

involve  his  sense  of  ambiguity  at  the  role  he  is  currently  playing,  of the  charismatic

and  accessible politician;  he  is forced  to  come  to  terms with  why  he  is the  one in  this

position  of incredible  power,  why  he  has  been  placed  in  the  role  of leader.  He  looks

out  at  the  people  and  "they  look at me,  and  I see the  perpetual  question  in  their  eyes.

'Why you?  Why  not  me? Why  you?' " (p.  42) There  is  a certain  arbitrariness  to  what

course  one's life ends  up  taking  that  has  little bearing  on  one's  personal  attributes  or

lack  thereof;  under  slightly  different  circumstances,  almost  anyone  could  have  been

in Brandt's  shoes. He  comments  to Guillaume  that  "Who  should  we have  turned  out

to be, if things  had  been  different? You might  have  been  standing  here.  I might  have

been  standing  there."  (p.  69) Identity  and  fate  have  a  fluidity  and  flexibility  that

make  it  all  the  more  difficult  to  ever  truly  determine  where  one  stands.  Guillaume

could  just  have  easily  been  a West  German  as  not;  it  is  only  through  the  particular

twists  of  his  life  that  he  ended  up  being  an  East  German  spy.  So  his  conflicting

loyalties  are  completely  reasonable,  as  there  are  no  common  regulations  on  how  he

should  think  and  feel; under  other  circumstances,  he would  naturally  feel differently,

and  since the  possibilities  for his  future  are  so arbitrary,  it  is expected  that  he would

have  conflicting  feelings  about  his  current  situation.  While  quoting  Walt  Whitman,

Brandt  states  "  'Do  I contradict myself? Very well then  I contradict  myself. I am large,

I contain  multitudes.'  "  (p.  71) It  is foolish  to  attempt  to  restrict  one's  identity  to  the

simple  externality  that  one presents  to  the world  when  in  reality  it encompasses  such

a larger scope of the  human  experience.

This  fluidity  of identity  and  situation  is also  critical  to  the  physical  staging  of

the  play.  The play  mostly  alternates  between  Guillaume's  conversations  with  Brandt

and  his  exchanges  with  Kretschmann  (with  periodic  interactions  between  other

characters), and  it  is  critical  that  Guillaume's precarious  position  between  two

opposing  worlds  is present  onstage.  Frayn  suggests  a  stage  of  desks  and  paperwork

and  his  exchanges  with  Kretschmann  (with  periodic  interactions  between  other

characters), and  it  is  critical  that  Guillaume's precarious  position  between  two

opposing  worlds  is present  onstage.  Frayn  suggests  a  stage  of  desks  and  paperwork

where  the  characters  not  immediately  involved  in  the  action  can  futz  with  reports

and  the  like  until  they  become  caught  up  in  the  drama  again  (which  also  leaves  a

great  deal  of  room  for  play  with  eavesdropping;  Wehner,  for  example,  might  be

paying  more  attention  to  a  conversation  between  Brandt  and  Ehmke  than  the  text

explicitly  states).  Since most  of Guillaume's  internal  conflict  arises  from  his  need  to

span  two  separate  worlds,  the  challenge  of  always  being  aware  to  whom  he's

speaking  needs  to  be  clear  in  the  staging.  He  has  to  switch  from  spy  to  personal

assistant  almost  instantaneously,  and  his  incredible  (and  necessary)  awareness  of his

surroundings  at  any  given moment  should  be apparent  in  the  spacing  of the  separate

onstage  realms  of the  East and West German  factions.

Throughout  the  course  of  the  play,  Guillaume  visibly  struggles  with  his

inability  to mesh  his  two  conflicting  desires:  to  stay  loyal  to  his  country  and  to  his

relationship  with  Brandt.  By the  end  of the  play,  however,  Guillaume  is revealed  to

be a  spy  and  is imprisoned;  Brandt  resigns  as  news  of the  presence  of  a  spy  within

his organization  (and  the  additional  leak  of  information  about  his  many  conquests).

These  two  men  who  have  been  paralleled  through  the  entire  play  (two  fatherless

Berliners stuck  playing  roles  they  don't  fully understand)  suddenly  take  very

divergent  paths  in their  respective  falls from  grace. Brandt,  Guillaume's  "reflection  of

myself,"  (p.  73) whom  we  never  fully  get  a  chance  to  know  (making  Guillaume's

attachment  and  sacrifice all  the  more  poignant,  as  it  is  wholly  unclear  whether

Brandt  returns  even  a modicum  of  the  affection  Guillaume  feels  for  him),  ends  up

watching with  gratification as the  Berlin Wall comes down  and  "our  divided  self

9

. 4

becomes  one  self"  (p.  91) while  Guillaume  is alone  and  cancerous.  Brandt  succeeds

because  he  is  able  to  successfully  sublimate  his  contradictory  characteristics  when

appropriate  while  Guillaume  never  is  fully  able  to  reconcile  his  disparate  loyalties

and  effectively self-destructs  while  Brandt remains  able to  return  later  as  a respected

statesman.  The play  ends with  a  sense  of pity  for Guillaume  and  his plight  as a man

stuck  between  two  irreconcilable  loves  (which  may  or  may  not  have  been

reciprocated);  he  spent  his  life  trying  to  gauge  people  and  situations  and  ended  up

failing  catastrophically.  "Life's  such  a  tangle...!  Everyone  looking  at  everyone  else.

Everyone  seeing  something  different. Everyone  trying  to guess  what  everyone  else  is

seeing. It's  such  an endless  shifting unreliable  indecipherable  unanalysable  mess!" (p.

75-76)The nature  of apparent  reality  is brought  into question  as layers  and  layers  of

identity  are  continually  peeled  off  only  to  reveal  even  more  complex  and

contradictory  emotional  states; in  the  end,  Democracyis not  a  chronicle  of a spy  story

gone bad  but  a tragedy  of a man unable  to ever fully be himself.
