The Life of Philosophy 

#2.  “Socrates ends the dialogue by saying that rulers of the state must 
be able to look forward to a better life than that of being rulers. He and 
Glaucon agree that only one life “looks down upon the life of political 
ambition”—“that of true philosophy” (para. 67). What is the life of true 
philosophy? Is it superior to that of governing (or anything else)? How 
would you define its superiority? What would its qualities be? What would 
its concerns be? Would you be happy leading such a life?” (p. 454) 

   In “The Allegory of the Cave,” Socrates states that the life of a ruler 
is the second best type of life. The best type is the life of philosophy. 
What exactly is the life of philosophy? Did living such a life make sense in 
Socrates’ time? In our own? Blah blah blah Thesis statement.
