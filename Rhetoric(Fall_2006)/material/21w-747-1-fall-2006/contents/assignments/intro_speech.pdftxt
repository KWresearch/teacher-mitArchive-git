 Speech of Self-Introduction 

 
Date Due: 2nd class 
Length: 3-4 minutes 
Directions: Give an interesting speech that introduces you to the class.  
• 
Its main purpose is to inform us about you, give us some insight into who you are. 
•  Your speech’s main points might describe your personality traits, or some interesting 
achievements, or some of your interesting opinions, or some of your major interests, 
or your goals—all of which support your explicit thesis.  
•  Develop your points using examples, stories, quotations, and/or definitions. 
•  Remember, the good stuff is always in the details. 
 
Procedure: 
•  Write your name legibly on the board 
•  Turn, pronounce your name 
•  Pause a moment 
•  Then start with your attention-getter--don’t start with “Hello” or “Well,” etc. 
 
Structure:  
• 
Introduction (2-4 sentences) 
o  Attention getter (1st sentence in introduction) 
o  Forecast of your main points (last sentence in introduction) 
•  Body (2-4 points): 
o  Main point 
(cid:131)  Example, anecdote, and/or evidence 
o  Main point 
(cid:131)  Example, anecdote, evidence 
•  Conclusion 
o  Brief summary of main points 
o  Final thought 
o  Say “Thank you” and sit down as we applaud 

 
Delivery: You should deliver this speech extemporaneously—i.e., although you have 
completely written out your speech, you will essentially speak the speech rather than read 
it. You should write out key phrases or ideas on a 4 x 6 note card (less distracting to your 
audience than a full sheet of paper). 
 
Practice: You should practice giving your whole speech all the way through without 
stopping 3-5 times before the day of the speech. It is particularly useful if you can practice 
your speech at least once or twice in front of someone (a friend, a consultant at the Writing 
Center).
