Steve’s goals for ME #3: The point of this assignment is to get you to delve deeply into 
each aspect of the text, not simply to list the things you saw but to explore, examine, 
elaborate, interpret, and evaluate. I want you to pull out all the rhetorical stops and make 
this essay the most rhetorically sophisticated essay you have written this semester. Craft 
your essay to make effective use of ethos, logos, pathos, and style. For any of the Options 
below, ample quotations from the text and your commentary about those quotations are 
needed for a successful essay. 
 

Option #1: Analysis and Argument 
 
Purposes: To use close analysis of a text(s) to make an argument about a topic. To argue 
that your analysis and interpretation are valid. To use rhetorical techniques and strategies 
effectively. 
 
Advice: You have unique analytical insights into the rhetoric and the ideas of texts to offer, 
but you have to do the exploration and thinking required to develop those insights in a 
convincing and compelling way. 
 
Directions:  Select 2 texts to work closely with. You may 

•  Select any “Connections” question in the book that you have not written on, 
including ones that deal with texts or even sections (e.g., “Education”) not assigned 
for the class. 
 
•  Or you may develop your own topic that brings together (in some meaningful way) 
at least 2 of the texts in IDEAS (they can obviously be from different sections of 
IDEAS and they do not have to be texts that were assigned for class). 
 
•  You may also use Singer’s “Famine” and/or Hardin’s “Lifeboat” with each other or 
use one (or both) of them in conjunction with a text from IDEAS 
 
•  Select two significant texts from elsewhere, create your own complex “Connections” 
question, and write the essay. 

Structure: 

•  Intro: an Intro does the following (not necessarily in this order): 

o  Names the author and the document. 

o  Establishes kairos—why should we particular readers care about this particular 
text at this particular time? Since we are all rhetors in search of good strategies to 
use, your Research Question should be a big help with this task. 
o  Explain the rhetorical situation (audience, context, occasion, where the document 
was first published or delivered as a speech, etc.). If you are using a text from 
IDEAS, Jacobus’ head notes will give you most of that information. This should be 
1-3 sentences. 

•  Background: A summary of the rhetor’s purpose, thesis, theme, and major points 
(1-2 paragraphs). 
 
•  Analysis and Argument: The majority of your essay--here you explore the texts, 
bounce them against each other, consider their ethical and rhetorical appeals, 
develop your own position, etc. 
 
•  Conclusion: 1-4 paragraphs that answer such questions as “What are the ethical 
and practical implications of my position for my own life? For the USA?” 

 

Option #2: Rhetorical Analysis of a Text and Argument 
 
Purposes: To say something useful and meaningful to your assigned readers about 
rhetoric. To argue that your analysis and interpretation are valid. To use rhetorical 
techniques and strategies effectively. 
 
Advice: You have unique analytical insights into the rhetoric of texts to offer, but you have 
to do the exploration and thinking required to develop those insights in a convincing and 
compelling way. 
 
Directions: Select a text. It could be 

•  One essay from IDEAS 

•  or some other significant text or texts (for a total of at least 6 pages of reading) 
 
o 
o 

this could an article(s) in magazines such as Harpers, New Yorker, Nation, 
National Review, Atlantic Monthly 
this could be two (or more) articles on the same topic (the obvious choice might 
be reactions and discussions of the election)--one from the liberal Nation and one 
from the conservative National Review, Time and U.S. News and World Report 
this could be two or more articles on the same topic from a specialty magazine 
(e.g., Sporting News and Sports Illustrated, Cosmopolitan and Allure, 
this could be a series of editorials/articles on the same topic from a newspaper 
(or a comparison and contrast of two newspapers--e.g., the Globe and the 
Herald, two campus newspapers) 

o 
o 

Procedure: 

•  First, determine the text’s thesis and themes (Rhetoric Tool Chest, page 1-2) 
 

•  Then develop a Research Question about rhetoric. Your Research Question should be 
stated explicitly. Here are some sample Research Questions: 

o 
 “How does Martin Luther King, Jr., use metaphors to develop an appeal to 
pathos and to reinforce his text’s themes?” 
o  What aspects of style does Martin Luther King, Jr., use to create effects in his 
readers? 
o  What types of evidence (page 3 of “Rhetoric Tool Chest”) does Martin Luther 
King, Jr., use--when is it effective and when less so? Why? 
o  What types of language strategies (page 3 of “Rhetoric Tool Chest”) does Martin 
Luther King, Jr., use to create what kinds of effects? 
o 
In what ways does Martin Luther King, Jr., make appeals to values, 
commonplaces, needs, and symbols to convince his readers to accept his thesis? 
o  Your answer to the Research Question will be your thesis. 

•  Then select 2-4 Units of Analysis (a Unit of Analysis is one significant rhetorical 
element--everything in the “Rhetoric Tool Chest” under “For Analysis,” pages 1-6) 
o Note--if you wish, you can make one of the Units of Analysis “ethical appeals” and 
use material from the Ethics Tool Chest 
 
•  Then go through the text again, looking for and listing all examples of each unit. 
(e.g., you would make a list of all the metaphors in the text). 
 
•  Then categorize them (e.g., metaphors of light, of modern vs. old-fashion, of 
salvation). 
o The list and categories, however, are merely raw data. 
o In your essay you will need to answer the “So what?” question. 
 
•  Then decide/discover the impact that unit has on the meaning and effect of the 
whole text. 

Structure: Your essay should have the following 6 sections: 

•  Intro: an Intro does the following (not necessarily in this order): 
 
o  Names the author and the document. 
o  Establishes kairos—why should we particular readers care about this particular 
text at this particular time? Since we are all rhetors in search of good strategies 
to use, your Research Question should be a big help with this task. 
o  Explain the rhetorical situation (audience, context, occasion, where the document 
was first published or delivered as a speech, etc.). If you are using a text from 
IDEAS, Jacobus’ head notes will give you most of that information. This should be 
1-3 sentences. 

•  Summary of the rhetor’s purpose, thesis, theme, and major points (1-2 
paragraphs). 
 
•  Analysis: 1-4 paragraphs dedicated to analyzing each unit of analysis (you may use 
a subheading for each unit of analysis if you wish). The paragraph(s) should explain 
that unit’s effect/effects (intended by author and felt by you). Explain not only what 
the effects are but why the unit of analysis causes those effects. 
 

•  Insight: 1-4 paragraphs that explain what this text reveals about rhetoric--not only 
in the text itself but also about rhetoric in general (i.e., what can your readers take 
away from your essay to use in their own essays). 
 
•  Evaluation: 1-4 paragraphs that explain what you thought of the author’s argument 
and presentation and why. 
 
•  Reflection: 1-4 paragraphs that answer such questions as the following: What is the 
text’s relevance to your own work and your own intellectual life? Whose interests are 
being served by the composition and preservation of this text? What are the ethical 
implications of this text? 

Here is a sample ANALYSIS for a text in which the author uses clowns as metaphors: 

Clowns appear in three different types of metaphors in John Doe’s “My Life is 
a Circus.” Perhaps the most noticeable of metaphors are those that are 
metaphors about clowns. Blah blah blah (1-4 paragraphs) 
 
Although the metaphors about clowns are the most prevalent in the essay, 
those that compare other people to clowns are the darkest in mood. For 
instance, blah, blah blah (1-4 paragraphs) 
 
Although neither the most frequent nor the darkest, the metaphors that 
compare aspects of Doe’s personality to clowns are the most profound. For 
example, he says that “my Id is the clown supreme” (43). What does he 
mean by “clown supreme”? At least two possible interpretations exist. Blah 
blah blah. (1-4 paragraphs) 

Here is a brief sample for analyzing Ethos: 

Even though “My Life is a Circus” is a relatively short essay (only five pages 
long), John Doe uses four different techniques for establishing his ethos as a 
sad, thoughtful, bitter man. Etc. 

 

Option #3: Ethical Argument About Ends Justifying Means 

Purpose(s): Create and argue your own position about ends justifying means 

•  Possible global thesis statements/positions would be 
 
o  Using immoral means to achieve moral ends is never justified because… 
o  Using immoral means to achieve moral ends is only justified in the following 
cases and with the following conditions in place because… 
o  Using immoral means to achieve moral ends is often justified in the following 
cases and with the following conditions in place because… 
o  Using immoral means to achieve moral ends is always justified because… 

•  Then your essay would use examples drawn from our readings (or other texts). For 
instance, you say “Immoral means are justified when they are used to create 

Rousseau’s social contract and civil rights” and then you would use Rousseau and 
King’s texts as sources to explain what the moral ends are and which immoral means 
are needed and why there aren’t any moral means available, etc. Or “Nietzsche 
proves that it is natural and therefore good to use immoral means to achieve a moral 
end such as King’s desire for equality.” 

Structure: Intro, Summary, and Analysis are the same as those in Option #1 and #2. Use 
an effective rhetorical arrangement. Develop your points fully and use quotations.
