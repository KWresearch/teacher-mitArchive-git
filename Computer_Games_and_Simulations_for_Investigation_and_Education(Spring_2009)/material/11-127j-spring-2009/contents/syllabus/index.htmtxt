***** Course Description *****
During the past two decades, simulation, especially as it helps people to
understand complex systems, has become a mainstream use of computational
technology. The widespread popularity of "edutainment" software like SimCityâ¢
and Civilizationâ¢ gives a clear indication of the extent to which simulation
games have permeated popular culture. As these and other games have found
places in the classroom, researchers have tried to ascertain what and how
students (or people more generally) learn from these environments, and what
implications this has for software and curriculum design.
In this project-based course, students from all disciplines are encouraged to
understand how we learn from interactive computer environments, and delve into
the process of designing and understanding simulations and games for learning.
In the first part of the course we will explore the design and use of
Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) games and simulations in the classroom, and how
they have been and can be tailored to learning, including technical, practical
and pedagogical advantages and limitations. This will be combined with
scholarly readings from the emerging field of learning games. We will then
design non-digital games, and study both the design process and learner
outcomes. Next we move into the realm of the digital, again studying the design
and use of digital games and simulations in educational contexts. Finally, we
will also study what and how people learn from simulations (including focus
groups and user feedback), and how simulation and gaming tools can be
implemented in educational settings. All levels of computer experience welcome.
Graduate students are expected to complete additional assignments.
