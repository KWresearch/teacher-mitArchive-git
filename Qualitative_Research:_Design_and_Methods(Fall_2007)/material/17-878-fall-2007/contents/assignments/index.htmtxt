       Why qualitative research?           How? Where? What kinds of methods

       Positivist vs. (and?)               collect, what "findings" you find
       interpretivist approaches           interesting are all shaped by these
       Behavioral assumptions in social    assumptions. What are your own
       science research                    underlying assumptions? Where do you
                                           stand on the positivist vs.
                                           interpretivist divide? Why?

                                           Choose a book or major article that
                                           employs a case study for testing a
                                           theory. (Do not choose the same book
                                           or article as used for the previous
                                           assignment.) How did the author

                                           the case? How does the author define
                                           and limit the unit for study? Might
                                           the choice of other units lead to
                                           different results? Answer these
                                           questions in the form of a brief

                                           Imagine that you want to answer the

                                           worthwhile to collect the knowledge,

                                           interview subjects? How did you
                                           motivate them to provide you with
                                           the information you needed? How did
                                           you deal with stereotyped answers,
                                           evasiveness, lying? Please attach
                                           your questionnaire to the memo.

                                           (Examples: a town council, League of
                                           Women voters meeting, a protest
                                           rally, etc.). Your task is to come
                                           up with observations and insights
                                           not ordinarily offered by
                                           journalists. You might, for example,
                                           devise a method for ascertaining the

       Under what conditions is this       analysis of themes or metaphors
       approach feasible?                  presented by the speakers; tell us
                                           something about the symbols employed
                                           in the event; provide a kind of
                                           ethnographic description of the
                                           event (a la Geertz and the
                                           Balinesian cockfight); provide a
                                           "discourse analysis"; analyze the
                                           event as a "play," a "fight," a
                                           "religious" revival, or whatever
                                           else appears to be an appropriate
                                           metaphor. Use your imagination and
                                           ingenuity.
                                           Write a 3-4 page research proposal
                                           that could draw from existing survey
                                           data. You may want to compare
                                           attitudes in two or more countries,
                                           propose a study of changing
                                           attitudes within a single country,
8      Survey research                     examine the relationship between
                                           social class, ethnicity, gender, or
                                           age to a particular set of
                                           attitudes. In your memo be precise
                                           as to the questions you propose to
                                           answer, hypotheses you wish to test,
                                           and the suitability of the data for
                                           your proposed study.
       **** Doing fieldwork ****           Write a brief essay discussing the
       Gaining Access                      potential ethical issues raised by
9      Maintaining field notes             your proposed research project. What
       Ethics of fieldwork                 are the issues? How do you propose
                                           to resolve them?
                                           Prepare a 1 or 2 page single-spaced
                                           summary of your research proposal
                                           similar to the "Thesis Colloquium"
                                           abstracts circulated in the
                                           Department of Political Science. The
                                           summary should briefly indicate the
                                           research question, the hypotheses,
                                           the methods to be employed, and what
                                           the expected contribution of the
                                           research would be to the body of
                                           literature related to your topic. A
10-12  Research proposal presentations     total of 30 minutes of class time
                                           will be devoted to each proposal.
                                           You must limit your presentation to
                                           15 minutes, at which time the
                                           instructor will stop you. Fifteen
                                           additional minutes will be reserved
                                           for class discussion. It is
                                           therefore important that all
                                           students have read the proposed
                                           summaries and come to class prepared
                                           to offer constructive comments to
                                           their classmates.
