Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
 
Final Assignment  (at last)  July 4, 2008 
“Presentation: Putting it All Together” 
 
 
This is the last assignment and an opportunity to put into final form your ideas and 
designs to communicate to a larger audience. 
 
All work on the project will be finished by next Friday, July 14, when there will be a 
final presentation and review at 9:30 am.  All people who have been involved in the 
studio will be invited, including faculty, students, clients, guests, officials of the Beijing 
Planning Institute, and hopefully press and TV. 
 
The presentation should be in power point taken from four to six panels of final 
drawings.  These panels will be in A1 vertical size (or A0 – to be discussed) that can be 
used both for the power point presentation as well as be reduced to A4 for a magazine 
article. This then is the final product of the studio. 
 
 
The work should include at least the following but can be added to in order to clearly 
present the idea of your work. All text should be in Chinese and English. 
 
Products 
1.  Statement of the idea of your design/name of group/individual names. 
2.  Images from site to support your concept (chose two or three that relate to your 
design). 
3.  Master plan of larger area in relationship to your design such as uses, 
transportation and open space. 
4.  Overall Illustrate Site Plan (of total site) to clearly illustrate idea and act as a key 
drawing for other sketches, sections, diagrams and other material.  This drawing 
should be on one board and should be a large as possible (use vertical dimension) 
5.  Land use plan, Circulation plan, Public space framework plan (these 3 plans are 
derived from the Illustrative Plan and colored to indicate topics. 
6.  Detail plans/sections through site at key locations. 
7.  Digital model/physical model, sketches, axons, photo montages to show in three 
dimensions the overall concept. 
8.  Detail plans. sections, digital models of your special areas.  This is equal in 
importance to the Illustrative plan. 
9.  Any other material you believe is needed to clearly illustrate your design. 

 
The four panels along with models (if you have) will be exhibited in the lobby of the 
building. Each team will have 15 minutes to present their design with a power point 
presentation. After the presentations there will be time to discuss your proposal with 
individual guests.

The exhibition panels should be able to be reduced to A4 size (for the magazine) and still 
be legible. All illustrations should be titled and captioned to explain the drawing. See 
examples from last year. The major text should be in Chinese. 
 
All panels should use a basic 3 column vertical division of space (see examples).  
It is important that all work be completely finished so that on Friday the workshop is 
completely done, the work ready to be published. 
 
Work should be loaded on computer by 9:15 to be ready to start at 9:30 am. 
 
We will discuss in more detail on Monday at 9:00 am. 
Good luck!
