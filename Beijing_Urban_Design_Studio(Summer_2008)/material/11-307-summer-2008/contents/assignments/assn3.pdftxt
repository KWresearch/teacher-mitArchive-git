Exercise #3  
“Form of Selected Areas, Form of Detailed Plan and Overall Master Plan” 
 
Each team now has an overall plan/design for the area. It will be adjusted with new 
information from last Friday’s review as well as future work and your new thoughts. 
 
This exercise is to develop the plan of the upper area in as much architectural detail as 
possible in order to illustrate how the design will connect to the different uses and 
conditions across the site. There should be two areas that are concentrated on in more 
detail both in architecture and program. Finally, a master plan for the larger area should 
be finished. 
 
Part 1 
 
An overall master plan of the area of about 20 km square (say 4 by 5 km) showing land 
uses and roads. 
 
Use the International color code below: 
 
Yellows: housing 
Reds: commercial shopping, retail, offices 
Blues: civic, public 
Greens: open space, parks, plazas 
Purples: industry, work 
Grey: parking 
 
Part 2 
 
A revised illustrative plan (of upper area) at 1:2000 to suggest changes and more detail. 
 

1.  Detailed uses 
2.  Transit, auto, mass transit, pedestrian 
3.  Public/private uses 
4.  Public framework of places/paths 

 
Part 3 
 
Choose two areas that you think are important to explore in more detail.  (One should be 
the #4 furnace.)  After selecting the area, explore in more detail the following: 
 

1.  Architectural form 
2.  Uses/program of area 
3.  Relationship to other areas 
4.  Relationship to different uses and physical conditions.

5.  Circulation of all types 

 
 
Work at the following scales: 
1.  Plan at 1:500 (as many as needed to explain idea) 
2.  Sections at 1:200  
3.  Details as needed 
4.  Physical model  
5.  Sketches, computer model…… 

 
 
Take into consideration the five issues that were brought up at the end of the last review. 
 

1.  Overall Plan 
2.  Furnace #4 uses and design 
3.  High technology uses 
4.  Social, income and environmental issues 
5.  River/wetlands 

 
 
As much text in Chinese should be in the presentation and the Power Point Presentation 
should be partial in English and Chinese. 
 
Each team will have 15 minutes for presentation and 15 minutes of discussion. 
 
Due on Friday from 3 to 6 for discussio.(be ready by 2:45).  This is the last discussion 
before next week, which will be for presentation of the final team’s work.
