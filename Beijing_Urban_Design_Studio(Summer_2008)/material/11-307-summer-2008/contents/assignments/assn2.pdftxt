Assignment #2 
“Attitude, Overall and Framework Plan” 
 
Our next task is to explore different approaches to the future of the Capital Steel 
Industrial District.  In this exercise your team will solidify its attitude about what the area 
should become and prepare a program and design proposal, which illustrates this 
direction. There are three parts to the assignment 
  
A.  Design Concept/Attitude/Program 
 
In the first part of this assignment, you should quickly discuss and debate different 
approaches to the future of the area and agree on a preferred direction for your team.  
You should consider the area (as outlined), the remainder of the site and its surrounding 
site.  
 
In deciding on your direction, you may want to consider:  
 

1.  The use of larger community around the site. 
2.   What will these people do after the factory has been moved – can you provide 
jobs? If so what kind? 
3.  The East/West Street – what should be at the end? As we discussed there are 
many possibilities of ending the street in our site such as going across the river, a 
major focal point….. 
4.  Should there be one use or many uses on the site? 
5.  Transit to the site – there is a Mass Transit station nearby, but if this becomes a 
major center, there will be the need for are more direct Mass Transit stations. 

 
Due: 
 
1.  A one page written summary of the principles you feel should guide 
development in this area. (no more than 5-7) 
2.  A preliminary program of activities 
3.  A diagram of your planning concept for the area showing paths, land uses, and 
texture of buildings and spaces. 

 
There will be a short pin up on Tuesday at 10AM. 
 
 
B. Overall Land Use / A Plan for the Total Site 
 
In this part, you should look at the entire site and surrounding areas and determined land 
use for the total area.  The overall plan should illustrate all of your goals above.

1.  A one page written description of your approach. How does it illustrate your    
principles? 
2.  A Framework plan showing uses, transit, public spaces, circulation…. (1:3000 
3.  Identify 1-2 key nodes or sections that are key to your approach for further 
development (must touch the subway). 

 
 
 
C. Illustrative Sketch Plan / A Framework of Paths and Place 
 
In this part of the assignment you should develop your concept by illustrating design 
intentions for the six areas, placing greater emphasis on the 1-2 key areas.  
 
 
You should consider each of the concerns investigated in the first part: Circulation 
patterns; the transit; housing and living areas; commercial, office and work locations; the 
public realm of facilities and places, the story of the site and its people. How does your 
scheme address the issues identified for each of these topics?      
 

1.  A one page written description of your approach. How does it illustrate your 
principles?   
2.  An overall illustrative plan for the area, showing features of your proposal.  
(1:1000 scale)   
3.  Program and sketch design for one key sub area(s).  Sections or axonometric to 
depict massing.  
4.  Other drawings or analogous photos as needed to convey your ideas.  

 
 
All three parts due next Friday at 2PM.  
End of assignment
