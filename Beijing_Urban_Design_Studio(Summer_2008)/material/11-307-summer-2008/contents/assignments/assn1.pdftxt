Assignment #1   
 
The first assignment is to understand the site as thoroughly as possible in a 
short time. The intention is to know the site as well as you might know your 
own back yard at home. In order to do this we have selected six areas of the 
site, and will gather information about each area to share with the other 
teams.   Each team is to study one of these areas and make a presentation 
Friday starting at 2pm. Presentations should be about 20 minutes, lively, 
give a lot of information, conclusions, thoughts about how to use the area 
and not cause anyone to go to sleep!   
 
On Tuesday morning at 8:30 we will leave for the site in a bus and spend the 
day there gathering information. We will first be shown a film of the history 
and future ideas for the site by the owners. This is followed by a trip up the 
mountain to have an overview of the site and then lunch. After lunch we will 
travel throughout the total site by bus and then separate into teams to study 
your area. Each team will have a representative from the client to help you 
understand the area. Please be careful, it is a dangerous site and some areas 
are not to be visited, including three of the furnaces, the electric plant and 
the housing area to the south.  
 
For each area, the following topics should be researched and presented. 
Of course the importance of the topics will be varied for each site. 
 
A. Automobile streets and intensities       
B. Texture of street patterns â€¦ the framework of the area.     
C. Parking issues       
D. People movement       
E. Railroad lines. 
F. Types of housing and locations         
G. Historic buildings and areas.
