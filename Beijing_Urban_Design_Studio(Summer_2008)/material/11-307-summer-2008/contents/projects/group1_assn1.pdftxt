System 
Architecture 

•	

Two separate 
processes: 
–	 Steel making 
–	 Power 
generation 

System 

Architecture: 

Steel System


•	

•	

•	

The oxygen plant 
is located away 
from the furnace to 
reduce mass 
explosions. It can 
be assumed that 
O2 is pumped 
beneath the lakes 
and then above 
ground to the 
furnaces 
Processed coal 
and ore are 
transported above 
ground and by rail 
to the furnace 
ramp 
Hot water flows 
from lake to lake 
until it is cool 

System 

Architecture: 

Power System


•	

•	

This power plant 
also requires 
raw materials: 
train lines 
running 
between this 
area and the 
furnaces 
suggest that it is 
also used for 
the furnaces 
Condensers and 
cooling towers 
are a much 
more effective 
way of cooling 
the water used 
in the power 
generating 
process

Civic Structure -
Axes + Transport 

•	

•	

Site is bounded 
by its rail lines 
Two main entry 
points 
•	 Main car access 
becomes visual 
link to pavilion 
on the mountain 
– this link could 
be visually 
strengthened 

Civic Structure –

built forms


•	

•	

Raw material 
production of 
ore and coal 
forms hard-line 
boundaries to 
the site on the 
north and east. 
Currently 
inaccessible, 
the oxygen plant 
still has a strong 
major spine 
•	 Movement 
through the site 
encompasses 
both lakes

Cooling towers 
define the 
landscape. The four 
towers to the west 
already have a 
secondary function 
of being the place 
where plants are 
propagated for the 
site 
Edge conditions: the 
oxygen factory has 
a strong street edge 
The residential 
buildings in the 
south are in bad 
condition, but the 
urban fabric 
provides a strong 
relief from the scale 
of the industrial site 
and is pleasant to 
walk through
