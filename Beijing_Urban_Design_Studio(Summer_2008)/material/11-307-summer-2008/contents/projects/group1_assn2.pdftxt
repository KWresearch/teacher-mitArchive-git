In response to the dynamism of the  

location of the site our design  

concept revolves around the  

following ideas:

Developing a new conception of 
value in real estate development 
through iterative planning. 

Examining the city as a dynamic 
socio-spatial, economic and 
political network rather than a static 
conception of built form. 

Questioning the determinism of 
large scale master planning and 
exploring how urban design can 
become an adaptable process that 
responds to a rapidly changing 
urban context. 

Re-imaging industrial processes 
and providing a dynamic program
TsinghuaMIT
structure that supports this.

Closed System / Open 
Network 

•	

•	

The city is an ever-
changing interrelated 
network. Until now, the 
Shougang site has been a 
closed system whose 
boundaries divide it from 
the complex network that 
surrounds it. 
Through this project, we 
are interested in how we 
can strategically re-thread 
the Shougang site back 
into its surrounding 
dynamic network over a 
number of years.

Time in Urban Design & 
Dynamic Staging 

•	

Develop the site in a 
number of stages - each 
move is created only once 
the impact of the previous 
stages and their 
relationship with the 
surrounding urban 
networks is understood.

Time in Urban Design & 
Dynamic Staging 

•  Similar to the concept of 
Rotational Farming 
(where a piece of land is 
subjected to various 
growing cycles in order to 
maximize the fertility of 
the soil for the final crop) 
we see that different 
areas of the site may be 
in cycles of remediation  
while other places are 
being developed. This 
has the potential to 
provide jobs across the 
site and does not mean 
that one area is left 
dormant until it is time for 
it to be developed.

Feedback Loops 

TsinghuaMIT 
Beijing Urban Design Studio 

Peripheries 

•	 We recognize that this 
site contains a number of 
peripheries – both 
physical and conceptual. 
Rather than these 
peripheries being places 
of real or perceived socio-
spatial, political, economic 
and industrial divides; we 
see these edges as 
opportunities for the 
dynamic interweaving of 
multiple networks. This 
concept applies on a 
large site-scale as well as 
within the site itself and 
should affect 
programmatic, social, 
formal and economic 
decisions.

Restructuring the idea of 
‘value’ in Real Estate 
Development – the 
‘both/and’ condition 
Value in real estate 
•	
development has often 
been focused on quick 
monetary gain. However, 
through staging this 
project and incorporating 
feedback mechanisms to 
guide design over time, 
we can begin to develop 
value in many more areas 
including: the building of 
social capital, ensuring 
public amenity and the 
continued rehabilitation of 
the site. 
•	 We also hope to prove 
that through working in 
this way, the long-term 
monetary gains will be 
greater than short-term 
profits.  TsinghuaMIT

End the east west axis at 
the Shougang site, but 
continue the connection 
through to the sixth ring 
road. 
Finishing the axis in this 
way: 
–	 Reinforces the 
Shougang site as 
the traditional edge 
of Beijing 
–	 Allows the 
preservation of the 
urban village fabric 
at the axis terminus

Phase 1:

Industrial Innovation Expo


• 

The finishing of the east-west 
axis at our site and diverting 
the east-west axis 
•  A layering of themed 
thresholds leading up to the 
termination point of the East-
West Axis 
•  A new gateway in the north of 
the site that directs traffic past 
furnace no.1 
•  New subway and rail stations, 
as well as internal light-rail 
and bus systems. 
•  Creation of a hierarchy of 
roads, with pedestrian-
focused corridors identified 
within the Expo area. 
• 
Initial Remediation 
•  Revealing the water links 
between the two lake areas. 
• 
Irrigation channels formally 
establish connections into the 
TsinghuaMIT 
surrounding urban fabric 
Beijing Urban Design Studio 

The Expo program gives us the ability 
to not only create access and mobility 
connections across the site but also to 
improve public amenity and make a 
bold statement at the end of the East-
West Axis. In relation to our organizing 
principles this has resulted in:

The functions and 
pavilions associated with 
the Expo embed the 
skeleton of the future 
program on the site, 
which is further 
developed in phase 2 to 
create a series of 
programmed thresholds 
with interesting physical 
and programmatic 
overlaps on the site: 

Phase 2: 
Skills Embassies 

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

•	

Three distinct districts are 
created: 
industrial innovation 
–	
think tank 
–	 Platform recreation 
areas 
–	 Skills embassies 
This is supplemented by the 
creation of several new “hard 
skills” training and lecturing 
facilities within the protected 
industrial structures (northern 
remediation area). 
The housing areas for the 
Expo are densified 
The north-west edge of the 
large lake is eroded to 
increase access to the water.  
The area to the south of the 
east-west axis enters another 
cycle of remediation. 
Administrative structures are 
TsinghuaMIT
developed along the east-west 
Beijing Urban Design Studio 
axis.

Reaction: Phase 2


TsinghuaMIT 
Beijing Urban Design Studio 

This phase sees a more liberal response to 
market pressures to the north-east of the 
site, given that the public and civic structure 
has already been underpinned here through 
the establishment of the “skills embassies”. 
This phase sees the attraction of more 
commercial, institutional and business 
functions to the site as a result of the 
development of an industrial skills and 
innovation district here, marking the 
transition to the development of an 
“industrial incubator”: 

Phase 3:

Building on remediation


•	

•	

•	

•	

A commercial and mixed-use 
edge is developed along the 
north-eastern edge of the site, 
Housing is further developed 
along the central axis of the 
site, and into the north-eastern 
section, in order to house the 
developing community in the 
area.  This development 
begins to formalize the 
connections across the site 
and into the neighboring 
movement/grid structures. 
However, a central swath of 
green remediation space 
remains at this stage. 
The fabric along the main axis 
and east-west bridge 
connection is further 
developed with housing, 
commercial and mixed-use 
fabric.
