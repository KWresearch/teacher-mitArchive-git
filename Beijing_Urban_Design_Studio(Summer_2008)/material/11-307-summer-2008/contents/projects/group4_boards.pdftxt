Viewing the environmental damage present on Shougang site 
as an opportunity rather than a hindrance to development, we 
have used the necessity of environmental reclamation to drive a 
new type of development.  This new option for living in Beijing, 
allows not only the current residents who choose to remain on 
site, but also migrant workers, and environmentally conscious 
Beijingers the opportunity to live in a community committed to 
reclaiming both the environmental and social landscapes of the 
city. 

The proposed environmental activities at Shougang give all 
residents the opportunity to make a difference in their envi­
ronment.  The modular expansion of housing provides smaller 
green spaces to all residents.  In addition to providing income 
for Shougang, large-scale remediation efforts will also provide 
employment, income and training to migrant workers seeking 
to transition from a rural to an urban livelihood. The inclusivity 
of environmental action at Shougang will build a dynamic com­

ment, necessitating large industrial spaces.  As the initial de­
velopment locations grow, these spaces are then subdivided to 
serve new functions.  This gradual and adaptive programming 
allows the site to develop according to its needs over time.

environmental laboratory 
The site will develop as a laboratory and campus for the re­
search and production of sustainable industries.  The campus 
will provide vocational/technical training to both current resi­
dents and migrant workers.  Additionally, it will provide integra­
tion support services to migrant workers, which would discour­
age the discrimination, manipulation and disenfranchisement 
that commonly occurs in the city

These typologies take into account the shif ting programs of 
large industrial buildings, and aims to provide all residents with 
the opportunity to work in the emerging green industries onsite.

As soil remediation moves out of the ma-
jor spaces, other industrial uses as well 
as migrant housing will move in provi-
sionally as the rest of the site is devel-
oped into industrial and light commer-
cial enterprises. 

As the remediation activities move else­
where on the Shougang site, the remain-
ing industrial volume can be broken up 
into smaller commercial and residential 
spaces while larger spaces will become 
civic and entertainment venues.
