We propose the development of a Global Sustainability Research Institute at the 
Shougang Factory Site. Our plan responds to the many features at the Shougang 
site—its location on Beijing’s east/west axis, the dramatic vertical landscape of 
manufacturing buildings, the height of Shijingshan Mountain and the presence of the 
historic Yong Ding River. We propose a rich mix of uses from research and 
development to testing and manufacturing, and an urban mix of housing and 
commercial facilities to support the Institute and its neighbors.

Institute clusters will include research and development, and the site will also re-use 
former Shougang buildings for manufacturing and testing of new green building and 
other products. Clusters will be arranged throughout the site to maximize overlap­

Historic steel manufacturing structures—furnaces, pipes, and other infrastructure— 
are preserved in a wide “green belt” that stretches in a wide swath along the north­
ern half of the site. The green belt becomes a dynamic community meeting space, 
meant for recreation, education and peaceful contemplation.  A network of pedestri-

The central green belt also connects the historic Shijingshan Mountain, where ruins 
of Ming and Qing period temples are located, along with a traditional Chinese-style 
pavilion at the top of the mountain, offering more dramatic views of the site. Educa­
tional programs and events related to the historic structures will be included in the 
site’s program.

river ’s edge, and can be enjoyed via a pedestrian/bike walkway that runs the length 
of the site. The wetland landscape also reaches into the site at the western edge, 
framing a courtyard-type of plaza.

Furnace 4, at the center of the green belt, is re-imagined as a dynamic Visitor 
Center, Exhibition Hall, and viewpoint. Spiraling walkways carry the visitor past 
exhibitions to the top of the furnace structure, to see panoramic views of the 
mountain, Institute and green area. Exhibition pavilions from Institute members, 
showcasing sustainability practices, are featured throughout the green belt.
