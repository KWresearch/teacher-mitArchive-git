Long Narrow Strip

As an Integrated System 

Characteristics 

High density system
comprised of large scale
structures with sheltered 
interior spaces. 

Multiple scales of pipe
create elevated material 
circulation systems. 

Pipes create a second
ground unifying the entire
site. 

Structured vegetation used
to reinforce edges 

Ground transportation
systems vary in scale and
purpose: Vehicular, train,
pedestrian paths 

Zone 1 
Co-generation Plant 

Characteristics: 

Series of steel and concrete 
structures and elevated 
conveyers devoted to
energy generation 

Tallest structure in zone, 
smoke stack, creates a 
connection between 
adjacent cooling towers and
mountain 

Small amount of structured 
green space 

Large interior courtyards 

Vehicular transportation
forms 3 edges, while train
transportation and river form
the western edge 

Zone 1 
Co-generation Plant 

Seven  steel structures 

Larger structure with
concrete frame and steel 
roof 

Most in good condition
