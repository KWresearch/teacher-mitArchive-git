1.  Monument to work 
a.  Celebrating the ethos of work in Chinese society 
b. 
The project will be an active monument to the unique position of the manufacturing industry in the 
accelerated growth of the Chinese economy 
c.  At the centre of the monument complex will be the Monument to the Worker, which is housed in Furnace 5.  
Indeed, it is the void created by the violent removal of Furnace 5 that acts as monument. 

2.  Dynamic Monument 
a.  New modes of production are grafted onto the existing network 
b. 
The complex network of pipes and rails becomes the framework for exchange between production processes. 
This short-circuits the present distance between design and production. 

To be an active monument, not a rotting ruin or a tabula rasa, Shougang Factory remains a site of production.  
This new production positions itself and China towards the future by remoulding this huge model of the old style 
of dirty industry into a contemporary benchmark for manufacturing and intellectual production.  It is in China’s 
interest to invest in research in the manufacturing process – multiple benefits can be derived – efficiency, reducing 
environmental impact, higher quality of manufactured goods etc. 

3.  Networks benefit from diverse and robust connections that already exist on this iconic and extremely large 
site.  Connecting different industries, types of investment, the manufacturing process itself and the community 
at large can create a cluster effect.  Thus, the site will integrate a global centre of design, industrial process 
development, light manufacturing, conventions and networking, exhibitions, entertainment, and related housing 
and commercial. 

4.  The logic of the industrial network on the site which consists of extraction, purification, combination, 
catalyzation, and moulding/shaping/refining controls the new processes on site.
