• Monument to work

– Celebrating the ethos of work in Chinese society

– The project will be an active monument to the unique position of the 
manufacturing industry in the accelerated growth of the Chinese 
economy

– At the centre of the monument complex will be the Monument to the 
Worker, which is housed in Furnace 5.  Indeed, it is the void created by 
the violent removal of Furnace 5 that acts as monument.

The global commodity network is geographically divided into zones of design, 
manufacturing and production

• Dynamic Monument

– New modes of production are grafted onto the existing network

– The complex network of pipes and rails becomes the framework for
exchange between production processes. This short-circuits the present 
distance between design and production

– Shougang Factory remains a site of production.  This new production 
positions itself and China towards the future by remoulding this huge 
model of the old style of dirty industry into a contemporary benchmark 
for manufacturing and intellectual production

– It is in China’s interest to invest in research in the manufacturing 
process – multiple benefits can be derived – efficiency, reducing 
environmental impact, higher quality of manufactured goods etc. 

The complex network of pipes and rails becomes the framework for
exchange between production processes.

• Networks benefit from diverse and robust connections that already exist on 
this iconic and extremely large site.  

– Connecting different industries, types of investment, the manufacturing 
process itself and the community at large can create a cluster effect.  

– The site will integrate a global centre of design, industrial process 
development, light manufacturing, conventions and networking, 
exhibitions, entertainment, and related housing and commercial.

– The network will be extended to reach out into the city of Beijing by 
way of a new Metro stop.

The Site will connect to the Research Universities and the Businesses in Beijing

• The logic of the industrial network controls the new processes on site

– extraction
– purification 
– combination
– catalyzation
– moulding/shaping/refining
