spaces, along roadway 

Steel and concrete 
structures 

Train circulation flows 
through block while
vehicular traffic creates 
edges

interesting concrete 
structures 

Overhead pipe systems less
prevalent than in other areas 

Zone 2 
Raw Material Processing 

Large steel structures are in
poor condition 

Concrete milling factory is in
good condition 

Vertical wells 

Zone 2 
Raw Material Processing

vegetation near railroad. 

Zone 3 

Power Factory 

Brick and Concrete building 

Good condition 

Monolithic, in contrast with 
elevated  pipe and passage 
systems 

Zone 3 

Power Factory 

Overhead material transport 
systems
