Implications:

migrant demographics

Where do they typically live?

How long do they usually stay in Beijing?

Implications:
Rent and upkeep must be inexpensive to allow 
for migrant population

Implications:
Training process should be half a year or less

Community should facilitate frequent turn-over: Furniture exhange 
market, Temporary furniture

Site should have convenient transpor tation to major transpor t hubs

Emotional suppor t, networking, and mentoring for new arrivals

migrant demographics

What is their education level?

Where do they typically work?

Implications:
Government sponsored education to finish middle school

Retired workers could act as teachers in standard and vocational 
training centers

Impli
cations:
The S
hougang community contains work in all sectors, allowing 
resid
ents to build of f of their own skills and learn from their peers
