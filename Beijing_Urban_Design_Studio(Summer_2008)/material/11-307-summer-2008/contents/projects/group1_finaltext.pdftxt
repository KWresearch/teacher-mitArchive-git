In response to the dynamism of the location of the site at a real and conceptual urban 
r v
periphery our design concept  e olves around: 
Design Concept 
• 
Examining  the  city  as  a  dynamic  socio-spatial,  economic  and  political  network 
rather than a static conception of built form. 
• 
Questioning  the  determinism  of  large  scale  master-planning  and  exploring  how 
urban design can become an adaptable process  that responds  to a  rapidly changing urban 
context.  
Developing  a  new  conception  of  value  in  real  estate  development  through  iterative 
• 
planning. 
Re-imaging  industrial  processes  and  providing  a  dynamic  program  structure  that 
• 
supports this. 
The  area  around  the  Shougang  factory  site  shows  evidence  of  rap id  development, 
particularly  in  the  creation  of  high-rise  housing  estates. At  the  same  time, many  recently-
Our Approach 
urbanized  families  occupy  low-rise,  dense  housing  pockets  interspersed  within  this  new 
fabric,  and  have  little  access  to  public  space,  public  transport  and  employment 
opportunities.   With  the  relocation  of  the  steel mill, many workers  and  their  families will 
remain within the district and will require housing and employment opportunities.   
The  new  housing  developments  outside  the  Shougang  factory  site  do  not  adequately 
address  the  social  demands  within  the  area,  nor  do  they  address   the  cultural  and 
environmental  value  of  the  district  as  an  historic  industrial  d istrict  and  as  a  green 
urban edge. 
In focusing on developing a public framework within the site that strongly responds to the 
civic logic of Beijing – rethreading the Shougang site back into the city – new opportunities 
for access to dynamic urban networks would be provided.  This would increase: 
Economic  value,  through  developing  in  a  series  of  iterative  layers  or  stages  and  through 
the remediation of certain areas of the site; 
Social  value,  through  prioritizing  the  development  of  a  dignified  public-space  network, 
which would remain and be reinforced through iterative development layerings of the 
site, thus creating community centers and urban connections; 

Cultural  value,  through  the  retaining  and  reinterpretation of  the  industrial  role of  the  site 
within  Beijing,  thus  preserving  certain  existing  spaces,  structures  and  skills  in  a 
dynamic an
ngful way; 
d meani
Environmental  value,  through  the  linking  of  Shougang’s  vast  riverfront,  mountain  areas 
and green spaces back into the public structure of Beijing. 
Thus our design approach  is  strongly  linked  to  the notion of civic  layering, where a series 
of  urban  design  “moves”  happen  to  maximize  on  the  economic,  soc ial,  cultural  and 
environmental  value  of  the  site,  each being  influenced by  the  layers  that  came  before  and 
after.    In  concentrating  on  securing  the  main  civic  “moves”,  a  certain  amount  of  freedom 
and  responsiveness  is  allowed,  where  the  development  of  the  site  may  be  taken  up  by 
multiple  parties  over  time  without  compromising  civic  structura l  and  access  to  public 
spaces.   
In determining a “first move” catalyst layer, the highly-imageable notion of an exposition 
was drawn upon. A new type of industrial exposition is proposed for the site as an 
instrument for re-examining the potential role of industry in Beijing and solidifying the 
i 
dentity of the site as a space of both industrial innovation and tradition.
