The proposal situates a 2 million square meter zoo on  the current Shougang 
Iron and Steel Factory site. Considered a catalyst for the redevelopment of the 
industrial site, the zoo attracts multiple programs of education, leisure, com­
merce, offices, housing, and hotels. The project reorganizes the zoo  to con­
nect  the  river  to  the  rest  of  the  city,  introducing  novel  and  accessible  public 
spaces to the western par t of Beijing. 

The conceptual backbone of the project rests on the notion of “high” and “low” 
and the desire to  increase public space  in the city. How can the site become 
a sustainable and profitable attraction while accomodating unemployed steel 
and iron workers?

The Masterplan 

The masterplan acknowledges the riverside as a potential site of leisure for both 
locals  and  tourists.  The  proposed  zoo  and  green  areas  occupy  the  riverside 
in a gesture of publicness. The zoo, as we imagine, is open to the public for a 
nominal fee. Not to be mistaken for an overly  idealistic masterplan, however, 
the project includes exclusive hotels and priveleged views of the zoo and the 
city. Those who can afford the experience, may pay to live in the wilderness. 

The project is more than just a tourist site. We propose a satellite campus of 
Tsinghua University. Students  from  the Depar tments of Zoology and Ecology 
will conveneintly study plants and animal species on a  first-hand basis. Stu­
dents, faculty, and suppor t staff may comprise a permament population of the 
Shougang site. 

Linear green spaces organize the site and activities. A developer ’s dream, the 
central  park  offers  scenic  views  from  flanking  buildings.  Additionally,  corri­
dors of landscape and program run across the width of the site -from the river 
to the eastern edge. These finger-like corridors both separate zones within the 
zoo, and extend into the city, acting as strips of circulation. Placed equidistant 
from each other, each finger generally includes a monorail stop and direct en­
trance into the zoo.

Zooming In: The Panda Reserve 

Existing cooling towers and a triangular shaped plaza mark the entrance to 
panda viewing area. 

A buffering zone of mini bamboo  forests and educational and commercial 
programs separate  the zoo  from  the city. These programs are arranged  in 
alternating bands, allowing pandas access  to bamboo and people access 
to buildings. 

In our proposal, Furnace 4 is conver ted into one of the main monorail sta­
tions.  It  is conventiently situated near  the Panda Reserve, an area  that will 
surely become a major draw for the zoo.
