Rhizofiltration 

Phytostabilization 

Phytovolatization 

Phytoextraction 

Hydroponically raised 
plants placed in contami­
nated water concentrate 
the metals in their roots 
and shoots 

Contaminant migration 
via wind, rain, and 
grounwater prevented 
through planting 

Cost ef fective for large 
volumes; applicability to 
many metals; less need 
for chemicals; reduced 
volume of  secondary 
waste; possibility of 
recycling; appealing to 
regulators and public 

Less expensive; less 
invasive; easy to imple­
ment; aesthetic value; 
allows for the postpone­
ment of action 

Plants absorb elemental 
metals from the soil and 
biologically conver t 
them to gaseous metals 
and release them into 
the atmosphere 

Minimal site distur­
bance; less erosion; no 
need to dispose of 
contaminated plants; 
require little main­
tainence 

Roots absorb contami­
nants and store them in 
above ground shoots 

Cost ef fective for large 
areas; reduce in con­
taminant mass; metals 
may be extracted from 
plant material; metal 
enriched plants may be 
sold 

Small, slow growing root 
systems; the need to 
specilized facilities and 
exper tise 

Not appropriate for 
highly contaminated 
sites; does not remove 
pollution; requires soil 
additives 

Less control over path of 
contaminants; may 
contaminate air 

Slow process; cannot 
reach deep contamina­
tion; must dispose of 
plants

Mixed Use The success of a mixed use block depends 
on the logical integration of varied pro­
grams at the architectural scale.  While not 
every combination may result in a new architectural prototype, understanding 
the way that two distinct programs will interact is crucial to plan a system of 
growth based on flexible modules whose function is constantly changing.

Currently in Beijing, and around the Shougang site, the

width or treatment between circulation within and between developments. 
Generally and programmatic uses are not mixed and the space between the

The hierarchy between roads and alleys is extreme in 
New York City.  There is little public access through or 
ganized by the surrounding streets.  Commercial fronts the surrounding streets exclusively 
or develops upward within the building.  Programs are striated and stacked through the 
building, but not mixed. 

Hutongs In the hutongs there is a clear hierarchy between public 
and semi-public circulation.  Commercial fronts the sur­
rounding streets, which are busier and more direct.  Indi­
vidual houses are accessed from serpentine lanes that create spaces for semi­

private functions.

Shougang The intention of this project was to develop a new typol­
ogy of block that combines elements from contemporary 
urban models as well as more traditional, human-scaled 
precedents.  In order to create flexible modules that could adapt to any combination of 
mixed uses within the block, the main circulation is directed through the center of the 
block, serving as access, greenspace and buf fer between the program elements.  The sur­
rounding streets are linear and direct to facilitate bicycle and small vehicle traf fic, but are 
narrower and more closely resemble alleys.  An architecture that steps down towards the 
center of the block and crenallates provides more sur face area for commercial frontage 
as well as the oppor tunity for semi-private spaces in front of residences.
