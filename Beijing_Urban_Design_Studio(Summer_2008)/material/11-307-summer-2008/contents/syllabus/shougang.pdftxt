Categgories of Contaminants
•	 Solvents 
e.g.: Paint thhinner, andd parts ddegreaser. 
Sources: Garages, industry. 

•	 Heavy metals 
e g : Lead  Arsenic  Chromium  Cadmium  and Mercury 
e.g.: Lead, Arsenic, Chromium, Cadmium, and Mercury. 
Sources: Metal finishing, metal plating, and manufacturing. 

•	 Petroleum 
e.gg.: Gasoline,, diesel,, and motor oil. 
Sources: Underground storage tanks, gas stations, 
tank farms, pipelines. 

Cleanup Methods for Brownfields
Cleanup Methods for Brownfields 

•	 Remove the hazardous substances and store 
them at a safer location. 
•	 Leave the substances where they are, but 
control them
control them 
–	 Caps and Slurry Walls 
–	 Solvent Extraction 
–	 Bioremediation 

Cleanup and Land Use
Cleanup and Land Use 

•	 The type of use determines the type of 
cleanupp. 
•  Residential use demand the highest level of

cleanup  because this land use involves the 

cleanup, because this land use involves the 
greatest likelihood of exposure. 

Contamination Assessment of the

Shougang Site

•	 Proxy—previous production activities on the 
site 
– Manufacturing plant, esp. refractories p
– Waste water disposal 
Waste water disposal
–	 Railway transport 
–	 Cokemaking plant
