***** Course Overview *****
Given that the quest for effective practice underlies the Housing, Community,
and Economic Development (HCED) philosophy, the course emphasizes strategic
analysis of the institutional contexts within which public, nonprofit and
private actions directed at housing, economic and community development are
implemented. A way of framing neighborhood institutions and organizations,
their relationship to one another and to citywide players is a theme running
throughout the course.
***** Course Objectives *****
As an introduction to the field of HCED, the course is structured to:
   1. advance students' understanding of how public policy and private markets
      affect housing, economic development, the local economy, and neighborhood
      institutions;

   2. provide an overview of techniques for framing public and private
      interventions to meet housing and community development agendas (broadly
      defined) of inner-city and low-income neighborhoods;

   3. review and critique specific programs, policies and strategies that are
      (and have been) directed at local development and neighborhood
      regeneration issues; and

   4. give students an opportunity to reflect on their personal sense of the
      "housing, community, and economic development" process and the various
      roles that planners play in implementing various elements of those
      processes.
***** Readings *****
There is a substantial amount of reading for this course. Students are expected
to attend class having read andÂ digestedÂ the readings, and to be prepared to
engage in intense discussion of them. Most of the readings are provided for you
under the readings section of this site. In addition to theÂ those,Â there are
four required books for the course:

Press, 2002. ISBN: 041592913X.

***** Requirements *****
In addition to doing the required reading, students are expected to participate
in class discussions, to give a 10-minute presentation (i.e. stating the key
assumption(s), the central argument(s), and any questions you may have, etc) on
one of the assigned readings, and to hand in two memos and an RFP. Expectations
for the presentation and the memos - their form, purpose, content, setting etc.
- will be discussed in detail in class.
***** Grades *****
The final grade will be based on 40% for class participation (includes your
oral presentation), and 60% for the memos and the RFP.
