To: Mayor Shirley Franklin 
From: Policy Assistant 
Re: Funding Community Development Corporation vs. Comprehensive Community  
Building Initiative proposed by Neighborhoods United in Change 
Date: 10/11/04 
 
Summary
 
This memorandum compares the assets and liabilities of creating a city 
investment fund to support Atlanta’s community development corporations (CDCs) and 
comprehensive community building initiatives proposed by a community-based 
organization, Neighborhoods United in Change (NUC). Based on this comparison and an 
examination of the role of municipal government, this memorandum will suggest 
recommendations for the most appropriate and impactful allocation of funds for the 
improvement of Atlanta’s low-income neighborhoods.  
 
 

Problem 

The project the city should support is dictated by what the goals of funding are, 

the desired role of the government, and the appropriate scope (time and impact) for the 

grant. CDCs provide tangible and relatively immediate solutions to the housing crisis in 

Atlanta but with limited effect on the surrounding community. Comprehensive solutions 

address the complex of interrelated problems in low-income communities but deliver 

intangible, long-term change dependent on successful service deliver and strong 

visioning. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Context 

Community Development Corporations: Assets and Liabilities 

Community Development Corporations (CDCs) have been an important part of 

community development for decades, fueled by increased federal funding after the 

government scaled back their affordable housing program. Primarily focusing on 

increasing the affordable housing stock in a community, CDCs also pursue social 

objectives that range from community services to community empowerment schemes. 

CDCs demonstrate several assets worthy of municipal funding. These organizations 

allow cities an opportunity to support housing creation without acquiring the full 

financial and administrative burden. Through this type of funding Atlanta can support a 

relatively quick and tangible community development project that will come to fruition 

during this political term. CDCs also pursue social goals through mechanisms, such as 

boards comprised of community members, which facilitate community empowerment. 

The liabilities of the work of CDCs temper the assets of the method. Despite 

CDCs increasing success in providing housing, many have criticized their work as 

ineffective and too narrow in both their housing and social endeavors. Most CDCs are not 

able to significantly increase affordable housing stock due to insufficient staff, time, and 

resources.  Furthermore, CDCs are only able to secure erratic community participation 

and funding. Clearly, these organizations struggle to engage social capital and establish 

social programs, and funders are reluctant to fund such efforts.  

Funding further confounds CDCs’ social programs because securing operational 

funding is difficult in comparison to funding for housing initiatives. Thus, while the

scope of a project may be more comprehensive, the lack of funding for the necessary staff 

and resources makes it difficult to realize the full scope of project goals. In light of such 

funding prejudices, providing a grant that a CDC can use to leverage against government 

funds for housing construction may not be the type of funding that would be most 

beneficial for community development corporations. 

 

Comprehensive Community Building Initiatives: Assets and Liabilities 

Historically, comprehensive community building initiatives have received less 

government attention and funding than CDCs but have recently gained saliency. The 

comprehensive model aims to create extensive social change through a variety of means, 

including providing services and creating skill-building opportunities for residents. While 

some of the objectives can include the “bricks and mortar” projects of CDCs, they also 

explicitly include building social capital and directly empowering community members.  

The comprehensive approach presents several assets. Community organizations, 

such as NUC, are well poised to implement comprehensive change because they are 

predicated on engaging community members extensively and collaborating considerably 

with businesses, non-profit organizations, and government agencies. In addition,  

although the time scale of this initiatives goes beyond this mayoral term, the protracted 

nature of the project firmly entrenches municipal support for improving poor 

neighborhoods and guarantees NUC’s long-term engagement in the community and 

commitment  to real change. Furthermore, while the goal of broad social change is 

difficult to measure, the small steps that create that change, such as a day care center or 

job training program, are tangible short-term goals by which to measure success. Lastly, 

NUC’s proposal differs from the CDC plan because its plans are always specifically

directed at poor communities and residents to increase equity. With changes in the vision 

of affordable housing, a CDC may pursue mixed-income housing in their development 

projects, dictated by the terms of their federal funding. Such projects may actually 

displace poor residents and can harm the position of low-income community members. 

Because success in this process relies on substantial community involvement and 

dynamic interaction between actors from many sectors of society, several liabilities 

weaken the comprehensive community building method. Firstly, the agenda is both 

implemented and developed incrementally and organically, requiring a strong vision. 

Such a method mandates that the NUC steering committee is able to both understand the 

needs of the community and deliver services in the short-term while designing programs 

to address some of the long-term, fundamental issues of the community. Secondly, 

collaboration is at the crux of NUC’s success. Staff must be particularly adept at 

identifying key relationships and establishing positive, strategic partnerships. In pursuing 

a comprehensive plan, organizations must be sensitive to the work and agendas of other 

groups and skillful in establishing mutually beneficial relationships. Lastly, an approach 

that includes a variety of actors, many different projects, and results in a range of long 

term objectives is difficult to fund because the ultimate goals are intangible, difficult to 

measure, and often take a while to achieve. 

 

Recommendations

Atlanta’s neighborhood development priorities dictate which method is most 

appropriate to fund. The CDC project allows our city government to partner in a 

relatively quick process which will result in a small step toward solving a growing 

housing problem in our city. In this scenario, the government’s role is to support private

endeavors to remedy social problems. The NUC option engages city government in an 

ongoing process and partnership to impact poor communities over time by providing 

services and opportunities. This model assumes government has more of an interest and 

responsibility in remedying social problems. 

 

Through this lens, I recommend the city award the grant to Neighborhoods United 

in Change. While housing in Atlanta is a real problem, so are unemployment, education, 

and access to services. Not to partner with a grassroots organization that is poised to start 

working on these issues, would be to miss an opportunity to begin work in an area our 

government has neglected for many years. In a climate where our federal, state and city 

governments have increasingly cut funding to services for the poor, private initiatives 

with the wherewithal to incrementally create change on so many levels must be supported 

by our city. 

 

In order to more fully support the NUC initiative and to ensure that the 

organization does not succumb to the liabilities of their approach, I recommend that- in 

addition to awarding NUC the grant- the city establish a “community organization 

liaison.” The liaison can provide technical expertise in sensitive areas where NUC staff 

and community participants may need support, such as long term planning and coalition 

building.  Not only must municipal government provide financial support to 

organizations striving to create change in their neighborhoods, we must also help these 

groups gain the skills to achieve success.
