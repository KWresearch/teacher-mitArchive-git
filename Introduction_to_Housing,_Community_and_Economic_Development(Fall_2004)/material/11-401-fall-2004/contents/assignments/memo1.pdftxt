Introduction to HCED: Memo Assignment #1 
Due: October 12, 2004 

 
 
You are a policy assistant to the mayor of Atlanta. You have been asked to draft a memo 
to the mayor advising on whether the city should award a group called Neighborhoods 
United for Change (NUC) that proposes an open-ended “comprehensive community 
building approach” to working in poor neighborhood in Atlanta, or creating a city 
investment fund that would allow community development corporations (CDCs) to 
leverage city dollars against federal programs in order to construct needed affordable 
housing. Please make your recommendation to the mayor, weighting the pros and cons of 
each approach.
