MEMO 
To: Her Honor, Mayor of Atlanta 
From: Arah “Karl Rove with a Heart” Schuur, Assistant Policy Advisor 
Date: October 12, 2004 
Subject: Funding decision for community-oriented monies 
 
Summary 
The city has enough funds to fully support one community-oriented project in the 
upcoming year.  Two options have presented themselves: funding a city investment fund 
to subsidize the development of affordable housing, and funding a community 
development corporation’s (CDC) community building efforts.  Although community 
building and affordable housing are both worthwhile missions for city funding, given the 
fiscal and political realities in Atlanta today I recommend that the mayor announce a new 
city fund to subsidize the development of affordable housing.  Creating this fund will 
result in several new affordable or mixed-income housing developments in the next 
couple of years, and this will satisfy critical stakeholders, promote the mayor’s message 
of progress for Atlanta, and provide tangible positive results that will buoy the mayor’s 
reelection campaign. 
 
 
Context of Problem 
This year, the city has limited funds to support community-based initiatives. This 
situation requires the mayor to make a decision between two programs – an open-ended 
community building plan run by a local CDC, or a city investment fund to support the 
development of affordable housing.  While both are good ideas, the mayor must decide 
which option furthers the goals for the city that she has outlined and supported in the 
past. The choice must also satisfy the maximum number of stakeholders, ideally by 
addressing a universal problem in a way that includes as many of the potential actors in 
the solution as possible.  In addition, remember that the mayor is up for reelection in just 
under two years.  While the administration has made significant impacts instituting 
longer-term changes in the city, there has been little substantial evidence of short-term 
successes leading toward the more holistic goals.  The mayor’s choice would ideally 
create the opportunity for these concrete displays of success. 
 
As the mayor knows, the stakeholder landscape in Atlanta is complex and multifaceted.  
Actors with social and political influence with constituents include local and national not-
for-profit organizations, faith-based organizations, activists, local media outlets, 
organized communities, and district-level officials.   Private firms and major employers 
in the city, as well as the unions, are also significant.  Finally, the mayor must consider 
the federal government.  With its recent announcement that it may revise its block grant 
funding calculation, Atlanta could lose some federal funds unless the mayor can make a 
strong claim, backed up by evidence, that that money is being used well.

Funding Options
The mayor has two options for next year’s community-oriented funds. 
 
Community Building 
One of Atlanta’s neighborhood-based CDCs, Neighborhoods United for Change (NUC), 
has approached the administration requesting funding for its comprehensive community 
building efforts.  While there are many definitions of community building, a general one 
is “…building community in individual neighborhoods: neighbors learning to rely on 
each other, working together on concrete tasks that take advantage of new self-awareness 
of their collective and individual assets and, in the process, creating human, family, and 
social capital that provides a new base for a more promising future and reconnection to 
America’s mainstream.”1
 
If this definition seems vague, it is.  In fact, this is the very nature of open-ended 
community building – the organizers take direction from the community, and the 
community sets priorities and goals.  In the case under consideration, NUC is unable to 
pinpoint what direction their efforts will take.  Funding this initiative would require 
supporting the process itself without any control over or commitment to end results.  It is 
even possible that the end results would be negative to the mayor’s administration, and 
would result in protest, negative press, and a degraded relationship with this and other 
neighborhoods. 
 
Community building is also a slow, incremental process in which trust and 
communication is established over time and goals are determined gradually.  In fact, one 
researcher notes, “Community building tends to build neighborhood capacity in 
increments.  Supporters need to recognize that such a process will take time and that, in 
any neighborhood, there will be setbacks.” (Kingsley, et al, p.12)  and another claims 
“Analysts have yet to produce scientific evidence about whether these [community 
building] strategies “work” in terms of measurable outcomes.”2  Again, while supporting 
community building is a critical position for the mayor, I believe that NUC’s program is 
not the best choice for city funding.  The long timeframe and lack of short-term results 
will be detrimental to the mayor’s record.  In another year, when the same funding 
decision needs to be made, NUC’s efforts may have little or no specific results, and when 
the mayoral reelection campaign starts in less than two years, this program most likely 
would not have any concrete evidence of success.   Finally, NUC represents only one of 
the numerous neighborhoods in the mayor’s jurisdiction.  I believe that using the city’s 
entire allocation of community-based funds on NUC will engender more conflict among 
the stakeholders than good will. 
 
Empowering neighborhoods is an important goal.  Communities with capital (social, 
physical, political, etc.) are communities that are focused in their needs and competent in

their interaction with the city and state.  I believe that this administration should foster 
community-building efforts with manpower, fundraising assistance, and a public show of 
support, but I do not think that the NUC program is the best use of this year’s limited 
dollars. 
 
 
Housing Fund 
It is commonly acknowledged that Atlanta’s housing affordability problem is one of the 
most pressing issues facing the city today.  The high cost of housing prevents lower-wage 
workers from living in the city, makes it difficult for young workers and families to settle 
in the city, and impacts the ability of local firms to attract out-of-state workers.  With the 
administration’s successful economic development programs, Atlanta’s neighborhoods 
are becoming more appealing, and thus more expensive, than ever.  In order to reduce the 
cost of housing, the mayor must take measures to increase the supply of housing by 
spurring new development.  A city-subsidized fund would achieve this goal by leveraging 
fiscal resources provided by the federal government for the creation of housing, dollars 
that the city is not utilizing today.   
 
Unlike community building, subsidizing housing development creates tangible, short-
term results.  “Housing investments had direct payoff…housing activities produced 
visible change that a CDCs believed would help build a community’s confidence to 
confront other issues.”3  Every project that includes permanently affordable units serves 
as a quantitative measure of progress toward one of the administration’s goals.  Not only 
do these numbers serve well in promoting the mayor’s current stated goals for the city 
and reelection promises, but the mayor can also make an appearance at each ribbon 
cutting, garnering media coverage and a chance to meet and impress constituents. 
 
Affordable housing enjoys broad-based and widespread popularity.  Boston’s Mayor 
Thomas Menino has earned the moniker “The Housing Mayor” for his well-planned and 
multi-pronged strategy to address housing affordability.  He is asked to speak around the 
country about his housing programs.  During the Democratic convention, national 
politicians and social activists were taken on tours of some city-funded housing 
developments.  This is not only good for the reputation of the mayor; it’s also good for 
the city. 
 
Housing is also a (relatively) easy way to address a city’s problems.  Supporting 
affordable housing development addresses a universal problem in a way that allows the 
market to play a role and a varied spectrum of stakeholders to benefit.  While some critics 
may claim that the mayor chose the safe, uncreative option to fund, I believe that 
involving stakeholders in the planning and competition for development subsidies will 
create good will for the program and the administration. Housing affordability is an issue 
that affects many of the organizations in this city, and a strong plan to address the 
affordability problem will attract supporters as diverse as CDCs with the capacity to 
develop, private firms in need of worker housing, for-profit developers interested in 
taking advantage of subsidies, mental health organizations, senior advocates and the

faith-based community.  For example, the area that NUC represents faces one of the most 
severe shortages of affordable housing in the city.  The administration should reach out to 
this community, using NUC as an intermediary, and encourage the neighborhood to set 
priorities and NUC to apply for funds to develop new housing. 
 
 
Implementation 
Another benefit of a housing fund is that there are many examples of this kind of program 
in cities around the country that Atlanta can use to design its implementation strategy.  In 
planning for implementation, the goals are: 
•  Fast and efficient use of the funds in order to start creating units in the short-term  
•  Proactive planning and inclusion of key stakeholders in order to build broad-
based support for the program 

 
To this end, I recommend the following steps to implementation: 
•  Determine the amount of affordable units that is the stated goal of the fund 
•  Determine the amount of funding available, the mechanism for application and 
the details of the program 
•  Meet with key stakeholders, including NUC and other neighborhood-based 
organizations to explain the program and elicit their support 
•  Announce the fund  

 
 
Conclusion 
In reviewing the two choices for city funds for this year, I believe that the housing fund 
emerges as the clear stronger option.  While community building is an important aspect 
of strengthening the fabric of a city, it is not a strategy that produces the kind of results in 
the timeframe that is required for public funding.  The loose goals and extended 
timeframe of community will certainly aggravate some of the mayor’s constituents and 
key supporters and financing one neighborhood’s program will alienate others.  As the 
mayor approaches the start of the reelection campaign, she will benefit by having some 
specific successes to champion.  New affordable housing development provides that 
quantitative, tangible result.  Finally, housing affordability is an issue that cuts across 
geographic, cultural, and organizational lines, and development is something in which 
many communities, organizations and firms can participate.  In conclusion, I believe that 
creating a housing fund is a better way to showcase the mayor’s accomplishments, a 
better way for a wide range of stakeholders to benefit, and is a higher priority for the city 
of Atlanta.
