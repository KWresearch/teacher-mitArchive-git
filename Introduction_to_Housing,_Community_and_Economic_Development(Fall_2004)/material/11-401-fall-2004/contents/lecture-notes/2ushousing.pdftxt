11.401: Introduction to Housing, Community and Economic Development 
Questions about US Housing Policy  
1.  How was/should housing be financed? How was/should housing be 
designed? (Question pertains to but public and private 
housing). 
 
2.  Left to its own devices, how would the private market allocate 
housing? Describe housing at the turn of the century in the 
United States for works and poor. How is housing allocated in 
other countries where the government-supported housing 
financial system is not strong (i.e. Brazil)?  
3.  Why was federal loan guarantees a breakthrough in the 1930s? 
How did it come about? Why were housing activists on the left 
(i.e. Bauer and Mumford) critical of that approach? What did 
they advocate instead?  
4.  Why was public support for public housing weaker here than in 
Europe? 
5.  Why in the U.S. is homeownership glorified? What are the 
political ramifications of homeownership? 
6.  What kinds of housing design were associated with the 1920s and 
1930s housing movements? What was modernist utopianism? What 
was the “arts and crafts” movement? 
7.  High-rise housing was linked to open space. Is the problem of 
public housing inherent in its original design or did it come 
about due to social and political neglect? 
8.  What is the role of local, indigenous, knowledge in the 
planning process? How do you know you “get it”?
