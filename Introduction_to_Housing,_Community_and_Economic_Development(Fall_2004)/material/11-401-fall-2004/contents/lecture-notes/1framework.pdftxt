11.401: Introduction to Housing, Community and Economic Development 
Reflecting on “Setting the Framework” 
1.  What areas of social life are generally considered “public”? 
And what areas are considered “private”? How does the division 
between public and private affect gender relations, past and 
present? What “private” issues should be left off the table 
when organizing communities? 
 
2.  How does the division between public and private affect the 
definition of “community assets”? How should planners address 
these issues when designing public and private spaces? 
3.  Define race. Has its definition changed over time? Define 
racism. Is there racism all over the world? Is race manifested 
all over the world as it is here in the United States? 
4.  Is racial conflict a public or private issue? 
5.  What is the difference between the conceived, lived, and 
perceived experience? 
6.  What are the similarities and differences between “oppressions” 
suffered by Blacks, Latinos, Asians, and poor whites? Are any 
oppressions worse than others? 
7.  Is there such a thing as non-ideological approach to planning? 
What ideological “baggage” do planners tend to bring into their 
field of practice? 
8.  What is the role of local, indigenous, knowledge in the 
planning process? How do you know you “get it”?
