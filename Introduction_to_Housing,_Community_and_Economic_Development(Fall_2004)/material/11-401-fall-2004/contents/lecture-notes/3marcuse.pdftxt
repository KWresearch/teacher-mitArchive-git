Peter Marcuse: “The Myth of the Benevolent State” and afterword “The Myth of the Meddling State” (1978) 
 

Housing Policy 
Tenement House Acts 
(1867, 1901) 

Official (Mythical) Interpretation 
To stem burgeoning problems of ill housing from 
which the poor greatly suffered. The Act 
prescribed minimum standards for fire safety, 
ventilation, sanitation, and weather tightness of 
roofs for accommodations rented to two or more 
families. 

US Housing 
Corporation (1918) 

Established to help house industrial workers (and 
their families) engaged in arsenals and navy 
yards and in industries connected with and 
essential to national defense. 

Veteran Housing 
Programs (Post WWI) 
Housing Act of 1937 

Assisted returning veterans to purchase housing. 

Removal of substandard housing with the 
construction of new public housing. 

Housing Act of 1949 

Section 8 (1974) 

Reaganomics 
(1981-1989) 

Removal of substandard housing with the 
construction of new public housing (urban 
renewal). Calls for “a decent home and a suitable 
living environment.” 
 
Assistance granted to private builders and 
mortgage lending institutions in the form of 
lending and guarantees. 
State-supported system of welfare granting the 
payment of rent to the private owner through a 
subsidy based on the occupant’s income. 
Rationalizes organizes and improves housing for 
the poor. 
Housing markets can function very well 
independently of state regulation. The state has 
only meddled, in an effort to help the poor, and 
in doing so has made things worse for them. 
Allow markets self-regulate. 

 
 Marcuse’s (Actual) Explanation
Contends that this policy actually had its origins in the 1766 building regulation 
(for fire prevention), the 1811 Commissioner’s Plan for New York (which laid 
out Manhattan’s gridiron pattern to facilitate speculation in land), the 1843 
cholera epidemics, and the 1863 immigrant draft riots. Thus, the Tenement 
House Act does not signal an “enlightened” government attitude, but rather 
State action to protect the existing socio-political-economic order from the 
dangers of urbanization and industrialization (immigrant labor organization). 
Claims that the ancestry of this policy lies in the housing built for factory towns 
such as Lowell, MA (textiles); Pullman, IL (railroads); Akron, OH (tires); etc. 
These industries found it necessary to build housing for their workers if they 
were to harness an adequate and reliable (read: controllable) workforce. WWI 
created the same needs in US cities where wartime production was centered. 
The housing that was publicly owned when built was sold to private owners 
after the war. 
Facilitated the purchase of single-family homes, opened market for this 
typology of housing. 
The Act stemmed from concerns about social unrest among unemployed city 
workers; it hoped to deal with that unrest, not through the provision of better 
housing, but through the provision of jobs. The expansion of the supply of 
housing could not be its goal, since more (substandard) housing was destroyed 
than new housing was created. 
The concern was not with rehousing slum dwellers but with tearing down slums 
–especially those blighting adjacent areas to business sectors. Idea that the 
private enterprise can do the job that public housing was supposed to do. 
Business/economic interests satisfied through major expenditures in 
infrastructure and highways. Suburban boom encouraged, new market for 
housing. Flight to the suburbs and decline of inner cities. Isolation/segregation 
of race. Reduction of public services available to the poor. 

Permitted private interests to build, own, and manage housing intended for the 
poor, with no limits on profit whatsoever besides those nominally imposed by 
administratively determined rents. 

New myth of the “meddling state” is born. This is indicative of theory as 
rationalization for political policy. Its purpose is clear: to justify the reduction 
of state expenditures for social and redistributive programs, to make it easier 
to eliminate programs limiting the freedom of the private sector to make a 
profit. For housing, this means the elimination of government subsidies and 
the reduction of public controls over development and use.
