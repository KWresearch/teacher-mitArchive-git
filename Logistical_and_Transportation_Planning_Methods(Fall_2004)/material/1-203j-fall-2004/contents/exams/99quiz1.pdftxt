1999 Quiz 1 

This possible problem notwithstanding, please answer all 
questions, showing all work.  Good luck. 

1.  At a particular ATM, customers arrive singly in Poisson manner 
with parameter ( = 0.5.   There is one server, the queue discipline is 
first-come first-served, and each service takes exactly one time unit 
to complete. 

(i) Suppose that Mendel arrives at a random time.   How long on 
average will he spent in the system (until his service completion)? 

(ii) Minerva arrives at a random time to find six customers in the 
system.   What is the probability distribution of her time in the 
system? 

(iii) If a busy period has just begun for the server, what is the 
minimum time it could last, and what is the probably it attains that 
minimum? 

iv)  If a busy period has just begun, what is its mean duration given 
that it is longer than the minimum value in (iii)?  (HINT:  What is 
the overall mean busy period?) 

2.  Suppose that x1 and x2 are U(0,a), and let  J(a) = E(x12 + x22). 
Use Croftonâ€™s method to determine J(a). 

3.  Suppose that a city has the shape of a square with side L with 
the lower left corner at (0,0) , and that it has a diagonal barrier 
along y=x up to the corner at (L, L).   There is one break in the 
barrier at (.8L,.8L), through which traffic can pass. 

      Suppose that emergencies occur uniformly over the city, and the 
response vehicle starts out from a location that is also uniform over 
the city.  (The locations of the emergency and of the starting 
response vehicle are independent.)  The streets follow the 
Manhattan-metric grid scheme.  What is the average distance the 
vehicle travels to the scene of an emergency?
