“We blew it.” 

--Henry Fonda (Easy Rider) 

Don’t blow it: Just answer all questions, showing all work.  Good luck. 

1.	 Suppose that x1  and x2  are independent and both U(0,a), and let G(a) be the 
expected value of the cube of the larger of the two variables.  Use Crofton’s 
method to determine G(a). 

2.	 Suppose that vehicles are distributed over a large city under a spatial Poisson 
process with parameter λ, and let vi  be the straight-line distance to a given point 
from the ith  nearest vehicle to that point.  Find the probability that v4  > 4v1  and 
also that v4  > 2v2.  (We are referring to the joint event involving v1  and v2 , not 
two separate events.) 

3.	 Mendel arrives at a random time to ride the Lemon Line, on which the intervals 
between trains are equally like to be 4, 5, and 6 minutes. 

(i)	

What is the probability that he waits between 4 and 5 minutes for the 
next train? (HINT:  What is the conditional probability that he waits 
between 4 and 5 minutes if he arrives in an interval of length X?) 

(ii)	 Would the answer to (i) increase or decrease if the Lemon Line 
became less variable and all intervals between trains were exactly 5 
minutes?  Intuitively, why does the answer move in that direction? 

4.	 Consider a small factory that has 3 machines that are all subject to breaking down. 
Machines break down independently of each other.  Whenever a machine breaks 
down, it is sent to the factory’s repair shop for service.  The repair shop has two 
parallel and identical repair stations.  Machines at the shop are repaired in a first 
come, first served order.  It has been observed that the time needed to repair a 
machine at a repair station has an exponential pdf with an expected value of 2 
hours.  The time until a repaired machine breaks down again (and has to go back 
to the repair shop) also has an exponential pdf with an expected value of 9 hours. 

Find the expected number of machines that are operating at this factory in steady 
state.  A numerical answer is expected.  Please explain your work clearly.
