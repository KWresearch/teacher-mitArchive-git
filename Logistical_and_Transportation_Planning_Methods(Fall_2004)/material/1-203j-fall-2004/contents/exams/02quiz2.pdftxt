Quiz #2  OPEN BOOK 
December 4, 2002 

 

 

1.  Please do Problems 2 and 3 in a booklet separate from Problem 1. 
2.  We have given you extra copies of the figures, in case you would like to use the 
drawings in your answers.  You are obviously also welcome to write all answers 
directly in your exam book.  If you want the grader to refer to answers or work 
shown on these extra figure sheets, please note this in your exam book (e.g. “See 
enclosed figure”) and label this figure as “Answer to Question <blank>”. 
3.  Put your name on each booklet, this exam, and the extra copies of the figures we 
have given you.  At the end of the exam, turn in all of these items, even if you did 
not write on them. 
4.  Remember to please explain all of your work!  We like to give deserved partial 
credit. 

 
Good luck!

Ambulance #1 

Problem 1 (35 points) 
Consider a square one kilometer on a side, as shown in Figure 1.  Geometrically, this is 
the same square that appeared in Problem 1 of Quiz #1.  That is, emergency incidents can 
only occur on the perimeter of the square and travel can occur only along the perimeter of 
the square.  There is no travel within the square.  There are no emergency incidents 
within the square.  U-turns are allowed and travel always occurs along the shortest path. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The square is served by two ambulances, ambulance #1 garaged in the northeast corner of 
the square and ambulance #2 garaged in the southwest corner of the square, as shown in 
Figure 1.   Ambulances always return to their home garage locations after answering 
emergencies.  So, an ambulance will never be dispatched directly from one call to another 
without returning to the home garage location. 
 
Emergency incidents are not uniformly distributed over the square.  The number adjacent 
to each link of the square is the probability that a random emergency incident will be 
generated on that link.  Once the link of the incident is known, the conditional pdf of its 
location on the link is uniform over the link. 
 
We model this system as an N = 2 server hypercube queueing model with µ −1 = mean 
service time per incident = 1 hour, λ  = Poisson arrival rate of emergency incidents from 
entire square = 1/hour, and response travel speed = 100 km/hour.  The usual assumptions 
related to negative exponential service times apply, as does the assumption that on scene 
time dominates the very small travel time component of the service time.  Assume that 
the dispatcher dispatches the closest available ambulance (i.e. of the available 
ambulances, the one whose home garage location is closest to the emergency).  
Emergency incidents that occur while both ambulances are simultaneously busy are lost. 
 
(a)  (10 points) Given that an emergency incident occurs while ambulance #1 is busy and 
ambulance # 2 is available, find and plot the conditional pdf of the travel distance for 
ambulance #2 to travel to the scene of the emergency incident. 
(b)  (12 points) Find the workload (fraction of time busy) of each of the two ambulances. 
(c)  (13 points) If the dispatcher moves to an optimal dispatch strategy, i.e., one that 
minimizes mean travel time to a random incident, determine the optimal boundaries 
for response areas 1 and 2.

Problem 2  (30 points) 
The undirected network shown in Figure 2 has 19 nodes, denoted as A through S.  ALL 
NODES HAVE WEIGHT EQUAL TO 1 UNIT.  The link lengths are shown next to each 
link.  The total length of the links is 130. 
 

(a)  (12 points) What is the length of the optimal Chinese Postman tour of this 
network?  Please justify your answer briefly. 
(b)   (18 points)  Find the absolute 1-median of the original undirected network.  
Please explain your work clearly.

Problem 3  (35 points) 
Consider the set of 3m+2 points shown in Figure 3.  Note that these points are arranged 
in essentially two rows.  The bottom row (see Figure) consists of 2m+1 points.  These, 
are arranged so that the leftmost point is the one labeled “a” in the Figure and the point 
immediately to a’s right is ε units away from a, where ε is very small.  This point is 
followed on the right by another point, (1- ε) units away (and 1 unit away from point a).  
This pattern is repeated, as shown in the Figure.  Note that the last point [i.e., point 
(2m+1) from the left] on the bottom row does not have another point a distance ε away. 
 
Turning to the top row, note that it consists of m+1 points.  The leftmost of these points is 
located perpendicularly above and 1 unit away from the leftmost point on the bottom row 
(i.e., point a); the second point on the top row is located perpendicularly above and 1-ε 
units away from the third point on the bottom row; the third point on the top row is 
located perpendicularly above and 1-ε units away from the fifth point on the bottom row; 
and so on, until the rightmost point (m+1 point) on the top row, which is located 
perpendicularly above and 1 unit away from the rightmost point on the bottom row.  Note 
that the vertical distances are all equal to 1-ε, except for the leftmost and rightmost ones, 
which are equal to 1 unit, as shown in Figure 3.  
 
Note also the “diagonal distances” equal to 1+β  or 1-δ , as shown in Figure 3.  From the 
construction it is clear that 1-δ >1-ε, or that δ < ε.   
 

(a)  (10 points) Beginning at point a, find and draw schematically a minimum 
spanning tree (MST) of the 3m+2 points of Figure 3. 

 
(b)  (10 points) Find by inspection and draw schematically the optimal Traveling 
Salesman tour that begins and ends in node a. Denote the length of this optimal 
tour as L(TSP). 

 

 

(c)  (15 points) To apply to this problem the “MST heuristic” for the TSP that was 
described in the lectures, all we have to do is duplicate the MST you found in part 
(a).  We would then find a solution to the TSP by beginning at a and tracing the 
graph obtained from the two MST’s (the original and its copy) visiting every 
point, skipping points already visited and eventually returning to a.  Suppose the 
length of the solution to the TSP which is obtained in this way is denoted as  
L(2-MST HEURISTIC).

γ all tend to zero (i.e., assume 
also assume that δ  is smaller than ε ).  What is the limiting value of this ratio as m 
tends to infinity?  In one sentence, the construction of Figure 3 provides an 
example of what?
