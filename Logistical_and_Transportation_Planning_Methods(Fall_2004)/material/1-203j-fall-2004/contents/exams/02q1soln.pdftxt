(a)(i)  Without  loss  of  generality  we  can  pin  down  X1  at  any  ﬁxed  point.  X2  is  still  uniformly 
distributed  over  the  square.  Assuming  that  the police  car will  always  follow  a  shortest  route  to  the 
emergency  incident,  the max  possible  distance  between  X1  and X2  is  2  km.  The  travel  distance  is 
thus  uniformly  distributed  between  0  and  2  km. 

(a)(ii)  Following  similar  logic,  the  max  possible  distance  is  now  4  km.  The  travel  distance  is 
thus  uniformly  distributed  between  0  and  4  km. 

(b)  Let’s  number  the  links  as  shown  in  Figure  1.  There  is  a  1  chance  that  the  emergency 
12 
incident  will  be  on  any  one  of  the  12  links.  Thus  if  we  can  determine  the  conditional  pdf  for  the 
travel  distance  from X1  (conditioned  to  be  uniformly  distributed  on  link  7)  to X2  for  each  possible 
link  for  X2 ,  we  are  done.  All  we  do  then  is  add  the  resulting  conditional  pdfs,  multiplying  each 
1
by  12 ,  the  probability  of  occurrence.  Careful  inspection  of  the  problem  reveals  that with  regard  to 
computing  the  conditional  travel  distance  pdf  between X1  and  X2  there  are  three  sets  of  links

Consider  link  1.  Deﬁne  X2  to  be  the  distance  from  the  right  most  point  of  link  1.  Then  the 
conditional  travel  distance,  given  that X1  is  deﬁned  to  be  the  distance  on  link  7  from  its  left 
most  point  and  that  X2  is  on  link  1,  is  (D |1, 7) = X1  + X2  + 1.  Let’s  deﬁne  V  = X1  + X2 . 
Note  that  X1 , X2  ∼ U(0, 1)  i.i.d.  Either  by  convolution,  or  by  the  “never  fail”  sample  space 
method  using  cumulative  distribution  functions,  or  by  recalling  problem  2(e)(i)  of  HW1,  we 
   d, 
ﬁnd 
d ∈ [0, 1] 
  0, 
2 − d,  d ∈ [1, 2] 
otherwise 
Now  the  conditional  pdf  we  want  for  link  1  is  fV (d)  “shifted  to  the  right”  by  one  unit  of 
distance.  Call  this  conditional  pdf  f (D |1, 7)(d).  Then  we  have  for  link  1,  f (D |1, 7)(d) = 
fV (d  − 1).  By  inspection  we  also  have  f (D |3, 7)(d) =  f (D |8, 7)(d) =  f (D |11, 7)(d) = 
f (D |1, 7)(d) =  fV (d − 1).  For  the  remaining  links  in  Set  1,  links  4,  5,  6,  9  and  10  “touch” 
link 7,  so  there  is no  shifting of  the pdf by one.  That  is,  there  is no  intermediate  link between 
them  that  would  add  1.0  km  to  the  travel  distance.  Hence,  f (D |4, 7)(d) =  f (D |5, 7)(d) = 
f (D |6, 7)(d) = f (D |9, 7)(d) = f (D |10, 7)(d) = fV (d). 
Set  2:  2,  12 
Consider  link  2.  (Link  12  is  probabilistically  the  same  as  link  2.)  Say  that X2  is  the  distance 
deﬁned  from  the  left  most  point  on  link  2  and  that,  as  before,  X1  is  the  distance  from  the 
left  most  point  on  link  7.  The  police  car,  which  can  make  U-turns,  will  follow  a  minimum 
distance  path  from  its  location  at  X1  to  the  emergency  incident  at  X2 .  Call  this  distance 
(D |2, 7).  Then  we  can  write 
(D |2, 7)	 =  min {X1  + X2  + 1, (1 − X1 ) + (1 − X2 ) + 1}
= 1 + min {X1  + X2 , 2 − (X1  + X2 )} 
Let  W  = min {X1  + X2 , 2 − (X1  + X2 )}.  Again,  X1 , X2  ∼ U(0, 1)  i.i.d.  Now  use  the  never-
fail  cumulative  distribution  function  method. 
FW (d) =  P (min {X1  + X2 , 2 − (X1  + X2 )} ≤ d) 
=  P (X1  + X2  ≤ 2 − (X1  + X2 ), X1  + X2  ≤ d) 
+ P (X1  + X2  > 2 − (X1  + X2 ),  2 − (X1  + X2 ) ≤ d) 
where  the  last  equality  follows  since X1 + X2  ≤ 2 − (X1 + X2 ) and X1 + X2  > 2 − (X1 + X2 ) 
are mutually  exclusive  and  exhaustive  events.  First  note  that min {X1  + X2 , 2 − (X1  + X2 )}
is  always  nonnegative  and  less  than  or  equal  to  1.  Now  consider  d  ∈  [0, 1].  Because  the 
joint  distribution  of  (X1 , X2 )  was  uniform  over  the  unit  square,  we  can  compute  the  above 
probabilities  by  calculating  the  areas  of  the  smaller  triangles  shown  in  Figure  2.  So,  ﬁnally, 
   0,
we  obtain  that

Now,  recalling  that  we  need  to  add  1.0  km  of  travel  distance  between  the  respective  links, 
the  desired  answer  to  this  part  of  the  problem  is

(i)  Because  the  two  arrival  processes  are  independent,  the  total  arrival  process  is  also  a  Poisson 
process, but with rate λ1 + λ2 .  If the server has just ﬁnished an idle period, the time until he is next 
idle  is  the  length  of  the  busy  period  that  has  just  commenced.  Therefore,  the  average  time  until 
the  server  is  next  idle  is  just  the  average  length  of  a  busy  period  in  an  M /M /1  queueing  system 
with  Poiss(λ1  + λ2 )  arrivals  and  exp(µ)  services.  That  is, 

1
¯ 
E [time  until  next  idle]  =  B  =  µ − (λ1  + λ2 ) 

(ii)  Each  busy  period  begins  with  an  arrival  to  an  empty  system.  For  a  given  busy  period,  let 
us  use  the  term  “trigger  customer”  to  refer  to  the  customer  whose  arrival  begins  the  busy  period. 
The  server  will  handle  only  one  customer  during  this  busy  period  iﬀ  no  additional  arrivals  occur 
during  the  service  time  of  this  “trigger  customer.”  Thus,  we  must  compute  the  probability  of  no 
arrivals  during  the  “trigger  customer’s”  service  time. 
Let  us  begin  by  noting  that  the  next  event  following  a  service  initiation  is  determined  by  the 
following  two  independent,  competing  exponentials:  the  time  until  the  next  arrival,  and  the  time 
until  service  completion.  The  probability  that  a  service  completion  occurs  before  the  next  arrival 
µ
is  given  by  λ1+λ2+µ .  To  justify  this  result,  consider  a  time  interval  of  inﬁnitesimal  length  .  Then, 
Pr(next  event  is  svc  completion | next  event  occurs  in  [0, ]) 
Pr(next  event  occurs  in  [0, ]  and  is  svc  completion) 
Pr(next  event  occurs  in  [0, ]) 
µ 
=  (λ1  + λ2  + µ)

µ

=  λ1  + λ2  + µ 
Therefore, the probability that the server will handle exactly one customer during a busy period 
µ
is  λ1+λ2+µ . 

= 

(iii) The  imposition of a non-preemptive priority policy does not aﬀect  the arrivals process and 
does  not  cause  the  server  to  work  any  more  slowly  or  quickly  than  in  the  absence  of  this  priority 
policy.  Therefore,  the  average  fraction  of  time  the  server  spends  busy  is  the  same  as  under  a 
no-priority  policy.  That  is,  it  is  given  by 

ρ  = 

λ1  + λ2
µ 

(iv)  In  deriving  the  preemptive  priority  queueing  results  we  saw  in  class,  we  noted  that  the 
average  busy  period  under  FCFS  is  the  same  as  under  LCFS.  In  fact,  the  average  busy  period  is 
invariant under  all  service disciplines,  as along as  they are work-conserving  (the  server  is never  idle 
when there are customers  in the system).  To see why, note that,  in order to empty  the system (and 
thereby  end  a  busy  period),  the  server  must  serve  all  customers  currently  in  the  system  and  all

of  their  “descendents.”  If  we  change  the  service  discipline,  we  do  not  change  the  arrivals  process. 
The  only  thing  that  changes  is  the  “bookkeeping”  of  recording  new  arrivals  as  “descendents”  of 
one  customer  rather  than  another.  This  change  in  bookkeeping  does  not  alter  the  workload  in 
the  system  and  therefore,  does  not  aﬀect  the  length  of  the  busy  period.  So,  the  average  busy 
period  under  this  non-preemptive  priority  arrangement  will  be  the  same  as  under  the  no-priority 
arrangement.  That  is, 

¯ B  =

(v)  z  gives  the  total  amount  of  time  that  both  of  the  following  conditions  hold 

1.  Mendel  is  in  the  system 

2.  a  type  2  customer  is  currently  being  served 

To  get  some  intuition  for  z ,  consider  the  following  two  cases 
Case  1)  Mendel  arrives  to  ﬁnd  the  server  either  idle  or  serving  a  type  1  customer. 
Mendel  is  a  type  1  customer,  and  therefore  has  non-preemptive  priority  over  any  type  2 
customers.  Accordingly,  in  this  case,  no  type  2  customer  will  begin  service  while  Mendel  is 
in  the  system.  Therefore,  none  of  Mendel’s  time  in  the  system  will  coincide  with  a  type  2 
service.  Hence  z  will  be  0. 
Case  2)  Mendel  arrives  to  ﬁnd  a  type  2  customer  in  service. 
Mendel may  or may not be  the ﬁrst  type  1  customer  in  the  queue.  However,  this  is  irrelevant 
for  the  purpose  of  determining  z .  In  either  case,  since  type  1  customers  have  non-preemptive 
priority over  type 2, once  the current  type 2 customer  in service completes his/her service, no 
additional  type  2  customers will  be  served  until  after Mendel  leaves  the  system.  Therefore,  z 
is  simply  the  remaining  service  time of  the  type 2  customer  in  service at  the  time of Mendel’s 
arrival.  Because  of  the  memorylessness  of  the  exponential  distribution,  z ∼ exp(µ). 
•  Pr(z = 0) 

Pr(z = 0)  =  Pr(z = 0 | Case  1)P (Case  1) + Pr(z = 0  | Case  2)P (Case  2) 
As  already  noted  above,  Pr(z  = 0  |  Case  1)  =  1,  since  in  Case  1,  no  type  2  customer  will 
be  served  while  Mendel  is  in  the  system.  For  Case  2,  since  the  remaining  service  time  is  a 
continuous  RV,  there  is  a  zero  probability  that  its  value  is  exactly  0.  That  is,  Pr(z  = 0  |
Case  2) = 0.  Finally,  note  that  P (Case  1)  is  equal  to  the  fraction  of  the  time  that  the  server 
is  NOT  busy  serving  type  2  customers.  This  is  given  by  1 − ρ2  = 1 −  λ
2  .  Putting  this  all 
µ 
together,  we  obtain 

Pr(z = 0)  =  1 −
