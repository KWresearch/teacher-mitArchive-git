(a) With  probability  0.3,  the  emergency  occurs  on  one  of  the  two  links  incident  to  the  garage 
location  of  ambulance  2.  In  this  case,  the  travel  distance  is  U(0, 1).  With  probability  0.7,  the 
emergency  occurs  on  one  of  the  two  links  not  incident  to  the  garage  location  of  ambulance  2.  In 
this  case,  the  travel  distance  is  U(1, 2).  Accordingly,  as  shown  in  Figure  1,  the  conditional  pdf  of 
� 
the  travel  distance  for  ambulance  2  to  travel  to  the  scene  of  the  emergency  incident  is 
0.3, d ∈ [0, 1)
0.7, d ∈ [1, 2]

The  state  transition  diagram  for  this  system  is  shown  in  Figure  2,  where  ﬁrst  component  of 
the  state  indicates  whether  ambulance  2  is  busy  and  the  second  component  indicates  whether 
ambulance  1  is  busy.  We  can  thus  write  the  following  balance  equations.

where  Tn (B )  gives  the  average  travel  time  for  unit  n  to  travel  to  a  random  service  request  from 
anywhere  in  the  entire  service  region.  Note  that s0  is  therefore given  in  time units.  Let us multiply 
the  RHS  through  by  the  travel  speed  and  let  Dn (B )  denote  the  average  travel  distance  for  unit  n 
to travel to a random service request  from anywhere  in the entire service region.  We can then write 
s0  as  follows,  in  units  of  distance  rather  than  time.

This means we shift the equal-travel-time boundary line away from the northwest and southeast 
corners  of  the  square  and  toward  the  northeast  corner  of  the  square,  but  moving  only  0.2  km  in 
those  directions.

(a) The length of the optimal CPP tour will be the length of the original network, plus the length 
of  the  optimal  pairwise  matching  of  odd-degree  nodes.  The  odd  degree  nodes  are  C,F,G,H,J,I,P, 
and  L.  By  inspection,  the  optimal  matching  is  C-F  (8),  G-H  (9),  J-I  (6),  and  P-L  (16),  where 
the  numbers  in  parentheses  give  the  cost  of  this  matching.  So,  the  optimal  CPP  tour  has  length 
130 + 8 + 9 + 6 + 16  =  169. 

(b) Let us ﬁrst use the ma jority theorem.  Consider isthmus (G,H), which separates the network 
into  two  distinct  subnetworks  with  node  sets 
N1  =  {A, B , C, D , E , F , G}
1  =  {H, I , J, K, L, M , N , O , P, Q, R, S } 
and  N (cid:1) 
The  total  weights  of  these  node  sets  are  given  by W (N1 ) = 7  and W (N (cid:1) ) = 12,  respectively  (we’ll 
1
use W  instead of the usual H  notation to avoid confusion with node H ).  As a result, we can discard 
the  portion  of  the  original  graph  involving  node  set N1  and  consider  the  subnetwork with  node  set 
(cid:1) and  all  node  weights  1  except  for  node  H,  which  now  has  weight  8. 
1N

Now  let  us  consider  isthmus  edge  (L,M).  Since  the  total  weight  of  nodes  M,N,O,P,Q,R,S  is  7, 
we  can  disregard  this  part  of  the  graph  as  well.  We  know  that  the  absolute  1-median  lies  in  the 
subnetwork  given  by  nodes  H,I,J,K,L,  where  nodes  I,J,  and  K  have  weight  1  and  nodes  H  and  L 
each  have  weight  8.  The  minimum  distance  matrix  for  this  subnetwork  is
