(2) 

Nodes 4 & 6 as well as nodes 3 &4 comprise Hakimi 2-median
Nodes 2, 4 or 6 are all one-vertex centers

The maximum distance vector is:

Node, k Max, m(k)

(3) 

The absolute center is easy to compute if one remarks the symmetry of the
problem.  Only, arc (2,3), (2,6), (3,6), (5,6) have to be inspected.  Moreover, if
one starts looking at arc (2,6) the local center is at 1 distance unit from node 2
(middle of the arc) and the maximum distance is 5.  Looking at the maximum
distance vector above, we conclude:
m(2) + m(3) - d (2,3)
= 6 + 8 - 4
2
2

= 5 . Therefore, we can discard the candidacy of

arc (2,3).

Similarly for arc (3,6) because:
= 8 + 6 - 3
m(3) + m(6) - d (3,6)
2
2

For arc (5,6):
m(5) + m(6) - d (5,6)
2

= 7 + 6 - 4
2

= 5.5(cid:222) We can discard arc (3,6).

= 4.5(cid:222) We have to look at (5,6).

Searching for the local center on arc (5,6) we find:

We find that the local center of arc (5,6) is in node 6, with a maximum distance of
6.

Conclusion: By symmetry the only two absolute centers are located on the center
of arc (2,6) and arc (2,4).

(4)  We build the MST using the greedy MST algorithm, we find 2 solutions:

The length of a minimum spanning tree is: 14.

Center on T is located on arc (2,4) at 1/2 from 2.

Chinese Postman:

Set of odd-degree nodes: {3,4,6,5}

Best Pair wise matching: {3,6} and {4,5}

Length of the Chinese Postman Tour: 34+ 3 + 4 =41.

(a)

The SQM for l= 0+ is the 1-median:
We have to find the 1-median. According to Hakimi's theorem, we can
find one at a vertex.
The distance matrix is:

(b) The SQM for l= lmax-e is also the 1-median because it is the last
feasible position before system blows up according to Pollaczek-
Khintchine (M/G/1).

(c) The position of the Loss median is the same as the Hakimi median.
Therefore, using Lemma in class + web notes, an optimal location is at the
Hakimi 1-median: node 6.

(a)  The equal travel distance boundary between the 2 hospitals passes through
nodes 2 and 5.
(b)  We define Hospital #1 to be the center of (1,4) and Hospital #2 to be the
center of (3,6). We define  h=l/2m=0.5
Intuitively one can speculate that the optimum primary response areas of 2
will be smaller than the primary response area of 1 because there is a greater
chance of getting a call closer to 2 than to 1. We use Carter, Chaiken and
Ignall formula to find s0:
= 2h
2h + 1

· [T1 (B) - T2 ( B)]

s0

10. T1( B ) = 1.5+3.5+7.5*2.5+1.5*2+5.5+5.5*2.5=46
10. T2 ( B) = 7.5+3.5+1.5*2.5+5.5*2+5.5+1.5*2.5=35
Therefore, s0=0.45 (cid:222) s0/2=0.225
The optimal boundary line is slightly “East ” of nodes 2 and 5.

Conclusion:
Node 1,2,4, and 5 belongs to the "optimal" (or “primary”) response area of
Hospita1 1
Node 3 and 6 belongs to the "optimal" (or “primary”) response area of Hospita1

2.
