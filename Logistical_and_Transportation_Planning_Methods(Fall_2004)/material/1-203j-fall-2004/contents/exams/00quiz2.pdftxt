Problem 1.  Queueing  (35%) 

Consider a single-server queuing system that operates as follows: 

There are two types of customers, Type 1 and Type 2, each type arriving at the system 
in a Poisson manner at rates  λ 1 and λ 2, respectively. 

Customers of Type 1 have negative exponential service times with expected value 1/ µ 1 
per service time.  Similarly, customers of Type 2 have negative exponential service 
times with expected value of 1/ µ 2 per service time.  Successive service times are 
mutually independent. 

The queuing system has capacity of three customers, including the one receiving 
service.  In other words, whenever three customers of any type are in the system (one 
receiving service and two waiting) the system is full and any additional arriving 
customers are rejected and go elsewhere. 

The next customer to be processed by the server is selected in the following way: If, 
after the completion of a service, there is no other customer waiting, then the next 
customer to arrive at the system, no matter of what type, obtains access to the server.  
If, after the completion of a service, there is at least one customer waiting, then 
customers (if any) of the OPPOSITE type than that of the customer who just completed 
service receive priority for access to the server.  (For example, if the last customer was 
of Type 1, then Type 2 customers, if any are present, receive priority.)  If no customers 
of the same type are waiting, then a customer of the other type, if any is waiting, is 
admitted for service.  Customers within each type are served in a first-come, first-
served (FCFS) way. 

(a)  Draw a neat state transition diagram for this queuing system.   	Make sure to 
define clearly the states and to indicate the transition rates for every possible 
transition.  (Omit the “dt” to keep the picture uncluttered.)  
(b)  Suppose an observer arrives at the queueing system and finds a total of 2 
customers of Type 2 in the system (including the one receiving service) and no 
customers of Type 1.  What is the probability that the next 3 departures from the 
system (of serviced customers) will all be Type 2 customers?  [HINT:  Note that 
the first departure is guaranteed (with probability 1) to be a Type 2 customer.]

Problem 2.  A Ten-Node Network  (25%) 

Consider the ten-node tree network above.  All link lengths are 1 km and all nodal weights 
are 0.100. 

a)  Find all 1-medians of the network. 
b)  Find all vertex centers of the network. 
c)  Find all absolute centers of the network. 
d)  Suppose we wished to find a location  X* ∈ G  that minimizes the following 
quantity: 

n 
α  hi d( X *, i ) +
i = 1 

MAX 
(1 − α ) i ∈ N {d ( X *, i)},  0 ≤ α ≤ 1,

where n = 10 nodes and N = the set of ten nodes.  

      Find X*. 


Problem 3.  Monte Carlo Simulation  (20%) 

Consider a hyperexponential probability density function, defined as follows: 

f X ( x ) = αλ e− λ x  +

(1 − α )µ e − µ x ,   0  <  α < 1,  x  ≥ 0,  λ > 0,  µ > 0. 

Using pseudo random numbers r1, r2, …, rn,…., draw a simple flow chart showing how you 
would simulate a random sample from this probability density function.  Each sample 
should use no more than two random numbers. 

Problem 4.  Cleaning the Lines of a Tennis Court (20%) 

An “official diagram” of a tennis court is shown in the diagram on the next page.  Just 
below the “official diagram” we have shown a simplified network or graph depiction of the 
boundary and service lines of the right hand side of the tennis court.  The dimensions of the 
network depiction (i.e., lengths of the respective network links in feet) are the same as 
shown in the official diagram of the tennis court.  For a tennis court that is a clay court, 
after the players have completed play, each player must “sweep” the boundary and service 
lines of his/her side of the court.  This sweeping is done with a special mechanical sweeper, 
hand-directed by the tennis player, which is used to sweep over every inch of the boundary 
and service lines. 

a)  Treating the boundary and service lines as a graph, is this graph a tree? 
b)   How many nodes of odd degree are there in the graph? 
c)  Assume that the player who is directing the sweeper is permitted to walk 
(Euclidean metric) anywhere on the tennis court.  That is, his/her path need not 
be restricted to the boundary and service lines.   Derive an optimal path for 
sweeping the boundary and service lines, where optimal means a minimum 
distance sweeping path.  What is the length of the optimal path?  How does that 
compare with the summed lengths of the individual links of the graph?  [The 
optimal path may or may not be a tour.  The sweeper need not complete the 
sweeping at the same point that he started.  But the entire graph must be swept.]
