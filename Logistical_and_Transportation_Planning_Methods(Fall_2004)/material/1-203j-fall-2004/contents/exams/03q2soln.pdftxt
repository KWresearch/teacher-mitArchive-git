The expected waiting time for the FCFS system is greater than the expected waiting time 
for the priority system, as expected.  When we assign priority to the customers with the 
shortest expected service time, we minimize the expected waiting time (see Corollary on 
page 239 of the text).

(c) Now, since ρ1 =1, neither class of customers attains steady state.  Both classes 
experience infinite expected waiting time in the long run. 

Problem 2. 
(a)  The ambulances are almost always available.	 The system is either in state 000 or 
(very rarely) in state 001 or 010 or 100.  Thus, whenever an ambulance is 
dispatched, it is dispatched to a random location in its own district or sector (i.e., the 
set of points within one mile of the ambulance's home location).  Thus the response 
distance is a r.v. uniform over [0,1].  The mean response distance is 1/2 mile. 
(b)  The workload or utilization factor is ρ= λ/(3µ) < 1.  Since µ= 1, λmax  = 3 calls/hour. 
(c)  Here all three servers are almost always busy. 	 That is, with probability 1 - epsilon, 
there is always a queue of waiting 'customers.'  FCFS means that the location of the 
next queued customer is uniform over the entire triangle.  The triangle circumference 
is 3 miles.  The ambulance takes a shortest route from its home location to the 
customer.  The customer is in one of two 3-mile-length segments emanating from the 
ambulance’s home location, and conditioned on the segment he or she is in, is at a 
location that is uniformly distributed over that segment.  Thus the mean travel 
distance is 3/2 = 1.5 mi. 
(d)  The ambulance will travel more than one mile if it is serving an inter-district 
dispatch.  Let Pj  = steady state probability the system is in state j, where state j 
corresponds to j customers in the system.  A random customer arrives and finds the 
system is state j with probability Pj.  If the system is in state 0, there is no chance of 
inter-district dispatch.  If the system is in state 1, there is a 1/3 chance of inter-
district dispatch.  That is, there is a one in three chance that the newly arriving 
customer is located in the district having the single busy ambulance, thus requiring 
an inter-district dispatch.  If the system is in state 2, following a similar logic, there 
is a 2/3 chance of an inter-district dispatch.  If the system is in state 3 or higher, the 
customer is queued and by FCFS is handled by an inter-district dispatch with 
probability 2/3.  So, the answer is 

BI =0 P0 +(1/3) P1  +(2/3)*( P2  + P3  + P4  + …), 

BI  = where probability that a random assignment is an inter-district assignment. 

By straightforward birth and death queue analysis of Chapter 4, we can find the 
steady state probabilities: 

= [1 + λ/ µ+ (1 / 2 )(λ/ µ) 2  /(1 − λ/ 3µ)]−1

Problem 3. 

(a)  We need a minimal length pair-wise matching of nodes of odd degree, in order to 
make a new network or graph having all nodes of even degree.  Then we can 
construct an Euler tour.  By inspection the matching corresponds to appending to the 
original network duplicate links for all interior bridges.  This is because the bridges 
are by far the shortest length links that we can use to create an augmented network 
having all even degree nodes.  In practice, this means that the jogger, when 
approaching a bridge that he has not yet jogged across, would jog across it and then 
immediately make a U turn and jog back across it.  (No need to match the two bridges 
on the two far ends of the total jogging route, as they have nodes of even degree; all 
others have nodes of odd degree.)  The total length of the jog is then 18.27 + 1.57 = 
19.84 miles. 
Note 1:  One student came up with another way to implement the Euler tour, one that 
is much less boring from a jogger’s point of view.  Start at the Science Museum north 
and jog south along Science Museum land bridge; jog to Longfellow and jog across 
it; jog to Mass Ave Bridge and jog across it, … continue this alternating path until 
jogger reaches south end of Watertown Sq. Bridge and jogs across it; now return on 
the Cambridge side and again jog across each bridge you come across.  It works! 
Draw a picture! 
Note 2:  Another student noted quite correctly that we did not explicitly ask for an 
Euler tour in part (a), only an Euler path.  Thus, allowing for Mike Jogger to end up 
at a different location than his starting location, we do not have to add the longest 
bridge – the Longfellow Bridge – to our augmented graph.  We can allow in the 
augmented graph two nodes of odd degree.  The jogger can start at one end of the 
Longfellow Bridge and finish his jogging path at the other end.  Full credit was given 
for both interpretations. 
(b)  There are 122  = 144 equally likely jogging tours.  Note that tour (3,7) for instance is 
different from tour (7,3); the same path is followed around the two selected bridges, 
but in reverse directions.  On any given day tour i occurs with probability 1/144.  To 
construct the probability law for the total jogging distance on a random day, we just 
compute the jogging length (in miles) for each of the possible 144 tours and assign 
the probability 1/144 to each.  Note that the distance for any tour must include the 
extra distance, if any, required for the jogger to get to and from the Operations 
Research Center at MIT to the closer of the two bridges in his tour.  We can express 
the result of combining 144 such calculations either as a probability mass function or 
as a cumulative distribution function.  Suppose the total jogging distance for tour (i,j) 
is dij.  Then the expected jogging distance on a random day is 

12  12 
E[ D] = ƒ ƒ dij  / 144 
i =1  j =1 

(c)  Each jogging tour has a minimal jogging distance corresponding to the sum of the 
two bridge lengths plus the two land distances between the two bridges crossed.  If 
the home location of the jogger on the Cambridge side of the river is between the two 
bridges crossed, then that location adds zero additional mileage to the route. 

However, if that home location is not between the two bridges, then there is a total 
‘deadheading’ distance equal to twice the distance from his home location to the 
closer of the two bridges.  This is extra distance he has to jog to get to and return 
from the cyclic route connecting the two bridges selected for that day.  To minimize 
the expected distance jogged per day, the jogger has to minimize (twice) the expected 
deadheading distance. 

Suppose the jogger’s proposed home location is west of bridge  j and east of bridge 
j+1, j =1,2, …, 11, with the bridges sequentially numbered from 1 to 12, starting with 
the Science Museum land bridge (at j = 1).  In the figure below, j = 5.

That is, the proposed home location is on the Cambridge side between bridges j and 
j+1.  Then there are j2  deadheading routes east of the home location and (12-j)2 
deadheading routes west of the home location.  Why?  The remaining 2j(12-j) tours 
have no deadheading distance.  Why?  These observations reduce the problem to a 1­
median problem on a straight line.  At any proposed home location for the jogger, 
(12-j)2/144 to the west. 
there are 'nodal weights' totaling j2  /144 to the east and 
For instance if j2  /144 > (12-j)2/144, then the mean daily jogging distance is reduced 
in a linear manner as one moves the jogger’s home location closer to bridge  j and 
farther from bridge j+1.  One seeks a home location for the jogger at which the 
'weights' pulling left and right are equal.  For if they are not equal, one reduces mean 
deadheading distance by moving the home location of the jogger in the direction 
having greater total weight.  The optimal balance occurs in this problem at any point 
between bridge 6 (Western Avenue Bridge) and bridge 7 (Weeks Footbridge), 
including the two nodes corresponding to the respective end points of those bridges. 
At these points the two sets of weights are equal, each being 36/144.  We recall in the 
one median that we may have non-nodal optimal locations  (in addition to nodal ones) 
if the weights pulling in each direction are equal.  If the total number N of bridges in 
this problem had been an odd number rather than an even number, then the optimal 
home location would be at a node equal to the bridge number (N+1)/2.  For instance, 
if there had been N = 13 rather then 12 bridges in this problem then the optimal 
location would be at the node corresponding to bridge (13 + 1)/2 = 7 (Weeks 
Footbridge).  Just as in the regular 1-median location problem, one does not risk 
missing an optimal solution to the problem by examining possible home locations 
solely at the nodes.  This is true whether there is an even or an odd number of bridges 
in the problem. 

Note:  In doing the quizzes, many students asserted that this is a 1-medan problem, 
but few argued why that is so and what the objective function is.  Few recognized that 
it is twice the mean deadheading distance that we are attempting to minimize and that 
the node weights – for tours that do not contain the home location -- are 1/144, not 
1/12.
