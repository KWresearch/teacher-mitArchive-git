Problem 1: M/D/1

The arrival process is Poisson and the service is deterministic. Therefore,
This system can be modeled by an M/D/1.

(i)  

Where, 

E[W ] = E [Wq ] + E [Ws ]
Wq = Average time in the queue
Ws = Average time in service = 1

We know that from M/G/1 note that:
l · E [ X 2 ]
E[Wq ] =
2 · (1 - r )

Therefore,

E[W ] =

0.5 · 1
2 · (1 - 0.5)

+ 1 = 1.5

( i i)  
The time that Mendel will stay in the system is: T = 5 + 1 + V
Because Mendel has to wait 5 time units for service completion of the
customers in the queue and 1 unit time for his service completion with
probability 1. V is the time until completion of the customer currently in
service when Mendel arrives.  This is a case of random incidence.  V is
uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 and as a consequence T is
uniformly distributed between 6 and 7.

If a busy period has just begun, the minimum time it could last is 1.
The probability that this event happens is the probability that
nobody arrives in this unit time interval.  Therefore, the probability
-0.5 » 0.607
is: P(A)= e

Let call B the busy period random variable and A, the event: 'the
busy period is longer than 1.
For M/G/1, we know that E[B]  =

We already know P(A) from (iii) and E[B|A]=1
Therefore,

Problem 2: Crofton's Method

The objective is to compute J(a)=E(x12+x 22) with, x1 and x2 U(0,a).

Crofton's Method boils down to solving the differential equation:

Where, J1(a)= E(x12+x 22|x1=a)=

A particular solution of the form Ka2 gives: K=2/3

Therefore,  J (a ) = 2

We use the perturbation method:

E[D'] = E[D]+E[De]

First, we know that E[D] = 2L/3

Let find E[De], the average extra distance traveled due to the barrier.

We present in details the work for the event A1

Let's A1 be the event that the emergency and the response vehicle are
located in (1,6) or (6,1).  The probability of this event happening is:

P( A1) = 2 · (0.8 L)2

Looking at the picture above it requires 4M/3 additional distance to go
from the center of mass of 1 to the center of mass of 6.

Hence,

Note that {1,5} = {2,6} and {2,4}={3,5}.  Moreover, {3,4} is the same problem
as {1,6} except that M=0.2L instead of 0.8L.

Finally,

E[ De | Ak ] · P( Ak )

After some algebra one finds,

Therefore, E[D']=2L/3 + E[De]=0.996L
