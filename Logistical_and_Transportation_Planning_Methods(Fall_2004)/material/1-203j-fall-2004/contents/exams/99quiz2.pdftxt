Briefly explain your reasoning. And good luck! 

Consider the 6-node, 9-link bi-directional transportation network, 
G(N,A), shown below:

The integer adjacent to each arc is the length of that arc.  The integer in a 
square adjacent to each node is the node number n, n=1,2,...,6.  The fraction 
adjacent to each node k is the node weight w(k), i.e., the fraction of total 
customer demand originating from that node. 

All parts of this quiz are based on this network.  Each part is 
independent of other parts. 

1.  [10 points] Find a Hakimi two-median of G(N,A). 

2.  [10 points] Find all one-vertex-centers of G(N,A). 

3.  [10 points] Find all the absolute centers of G(N,A). 

4.  This part deal with minimum spanning trees. 
(a)	
[10 points] Find the length of a minimum-spanning tree, T, of 
G(N,A). Explain your method of constructing T. 

(b)	

[10 points] Find an absolute center on T. Briefly explain your work.

5.  [15 points] Find an optimal solution to the Chinese postman problem. 
Explain briefly your methodology. What is the length of the optimal tour? 

6.  [15 points] Suppose that we want to locate a hospital on G(N,A) that 
operates as a FCFS M/G/1 queue. After serving a call located at one of the 
vertices, the only ambulance returns to the hospital. Moreover, our 
ambulance operates on G(N,A) following shortest paths.
 We wish to find a Stochastic Queue Median (SQM) on G(N,A). The SQM is 
the hospital location that minimizes mean response time of the ambulance 
to a random customer, where response time is the sum of travel time and 
queueing delay. We assume a constant travel speed equal to one. 

Let λ = Poisson arrival rate of customers from G(N,A), and let λw(k) = Rate 
of (independent) Poisson arrivals from node k (k = 1,2,..., 6). 

(a)	

Find a SQM for λ= 0+. 

(b)	 Define λmax = maximum value for λ such that for any  λ ≥  λmax  the 
M/G/1 queueing system is unstable for any facility location in 
G(N,A).  Find a SQM for λ = λmax  ε −  , with ε >0 and  ε 
<< 1 .

(c)	

Suppose now that all calls that find the ambulance busy are lost 
(e.g., they use a taxi instead). Each lost call costs the Hospital γ > 0 
dollars.  Find a location for the Hospital that minimizes the expected 
cost of response to a random service request, where this cost is the 
sum of the expected travel time to answered requests plus the 
expected cost incurred by lost calls. 

7.  [20 points] Suppose two hospitals are located on G(N,A), one each at the 
midpoints of links (1,4) and (3,6) respectively.  The system operates as the 
"2-server hypercube" loss system.  All travel is along minimum distance 
paths.  Assume that service times are i.i.d. negative exponential with mean 
equal to 1 (i.e., 1/µ = 1.0) and that the total arrival rate on the network is 
λ=1.0.  Moreover, assume a constant travel speed equal to c/2, where c is 
the speed of light; seriously, this is to make the travel time component of 
the total service time a negligibly small part.  Virtually all of the negative 
exponential service time is on-scene time. 

(a)	

(b)	

Find the equal travel distance boundary between the two hospitals. 

Find the primary response areas (set of nodes) for each of the two 
facilities that minimize the mean response time to a random served 
customer, assuming steady state operation.
