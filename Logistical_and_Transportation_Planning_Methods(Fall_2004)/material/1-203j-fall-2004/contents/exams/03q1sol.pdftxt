X1 , X2  are  uniformly  distributed  between  0  and  a.  Let  G(a)  ∗  E [max(x 1 , x2 )3 ]  and  consider 
G(a + �)  when X1 , X2  are  uniformly  distributed  between  0  and  a + �,  where  �  is  very  small. 

Suppose  a  <  X2  ≈  a +  �	 and  0  ≈  X1  ≈  a.  Then  we  know  that  max(x1 , x2 ) =  x2 .  There­
fore  E [max(x1 , x2 )3 ]  ∗  E [x2 ].  Since  X1  and  X2  are  independent,  G(a + �)  for  this  case  can  be

computed  as  follows: 

G(a + �) = E [max(x1 , x2 )3 ] = E [x2 ] =

where  fX2 (x2 )  is  the  probability  density  function  of  X2 .  Because  X2  is  uniformly  distributed  over

By  symmetry  we  have  G(a + �) � a3  as  � � 0  when  0 ≈ X2  ≈ a  and  a < X1  ≈ a + �. 

Finally, we  do not have  to  compute G(a + �)  for  the  case where a < X 1  ≈ a + � and a < X2  ≈ a + � 
because  the  associated  probability  is  negligible.

If  � � 0,  we  have  the  following  diﬀerential  equation:

Seeing  the  2a2  term,  a  “judicious”  guess  for  the  form of G(a)  is B a 3  (keeping  in mind that G(0)=0 
and  therefore  there  is  no  constant  term  in  G(a)).  Assuming  G(a) =  B a 3  we  have  G∩ (a) = 3B a2 . 
Plugging  these  values  into  our  diﬀerential  equation  gives  us: 
3B a2  = −2B a2  + 2a
→ 5B  = 2 
→ B  =  2

(Bjarnad´ottir,  2003) 
Let assume v4  is at some distance k  from the given point, with out loss of generality, we can assume 
k  =  1  (then  we  do  not  have  to  carry  k  through  our  calculations).  Then  we  know  that  there  are 
three  other  vehicles  inside  a  circle  of  radius  1,  which  are  uniformly  distributed  over  the  area  of  the 
circle. 

Let  A  be  the  event  that  v4  >  4v1  and  let  B  be  the  event  that  v4  >  2v2 .  We  want  to  ﬁnd  the 
joint  probability  of  these  events,  that  is  P (A � B ) = P (A) ∩ P (B |A).

P(A)  is  the  probability  that  at  least  one  vechicle  is  within  a  circle  of  radius  4 .  The  compliment 
1
of  A  is  the  event  that  no  vehicle  is  within  radius  4 .  For  any  one  vehicle  the  probability  of  being 
−��(1/4)2 
outside  a  circle  of  radius  1  is  (��12

For  event  B  (  v4  >  2v2  )  we  need  to  have  two  vehicles  within  a  circle  of  radius  2 .  P (B |A)  is 
the  event  that  the  second  vehicle  is  inside  of  a  circle  of  radius  1  given  that  the  ﬁrst  vehicle  is 
2 
1
inside  a  circle  of  radius  4 .  The  compliment,  P (B c |A)  is  then  the  event  that  the  second  nearest 
vehicle  is  outside  of  circle  of  radius  2 ,  given  that  the  ﬁrst  one  is  within  a  circle  of  radius  1  and

P (B |A) = 1 − P (B c |A). 

Now  P (B c |A) =  P (B c�A) ,  where  P (B c  � A)  is  the  event  that  two  vehicles  are  outside  of  AND

(Bjarnad´ottir,  2003) 
(i)  When  considering  the  diﬀerent  probabilities  for  Mendel  of  entering  in  intervals  of  diﬀerent 
lengths, we need to  take  into account  random  incidence:  Mendel has  4+5+6  =  4  chance of entering 
4
15 
in  an  interval  of  length  4,  15  of  entering  in  an  interval  of  length  5  and  6  of  entering  in  an  interval 
5
15 
of  length  6.  Given  the  Mendel  enters  in  an  interval  of  a  certain  length,  his  arrival  is  uniformly 
distributed  over  that  interval.  We  can  therefore  compute  the  probability  that  he  waits  between  4 
and  5  minutes  for  the  next  train  as  follows: 

P(Mendel  waiting  between  4  and  5  minutes)=  4  ∩ 0 +  5  ∩  1  +

(ii)  If the Lemon Line  became  less  variable  and all  intervals  between  trains were  exactly  5 minutes, 
the  probability  would  go  from  2  to  5 ,  since Mendel  would  always  arrive  in  an  interval  of  length  5 
1
15 
and  therefore  the  chance  to  wait  between  4  and  5  minutes  is  always  1/5. 

Intuitively,  why  does  the  answer move  in  that  direction?  (Barnett,  2003) 
We  see  in  the  ﬁrst  part  of  the  problem  that  the  chance  of  waiting  between  4  and  5  minutes  is 
higher  (20%)  given  an  interval  of  length  5  than  either  one  of  length  4  (0%)  or  of  length  6  (16.7%). 
Thus,  if  intervals  of  lengths  4  and  6  disappear  in  favor  of  5’s,  the  chance  of  waiting  between  4  and 
5  minutes  must  go  up.  (The  average  wait  goes  down  under  the  change,  because  the  possibility  of 
waiting  more  than  5  minutes  evaporates.)

The  small  factory  has  3 machines,  therefore  the  total  population  is  three.  Our Birth-and-death 
chain  has  therefore  only  a  4  states,  that  is  all  machines  can  be  running,  one  can  be  broken  down, 
two  can  be  broken  down  or  all  can  be  broken  down.  The  following  picture  shows  our  queueing 
system.

We  can  now  write  our  steady  state  equations:

P0  =  2 P1
3 
2 P1  = P2
9 
1 P2  = P3
9 
P0  + P1  + P2  + P3  = 1 

Which gives  us:  P0  =  243 
=  445 , P2  =  36  and P3  =  445 .  We  can now ﬁnd the expected number
