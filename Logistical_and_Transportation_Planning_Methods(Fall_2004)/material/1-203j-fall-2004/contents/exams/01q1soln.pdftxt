Problem 1  (Kang,  2001) 

Let  X1  and  X2  be  independent  random  variables  denoting  the  two  picks  that  are  uniformly  dis-
tributed  over  the  interval  [0, a].  Let  G(a) ≡ E [X 2 ] ≡ E [(max(X1 , X2 ))2 ].  Suppose  a < X1  ≤ a + ε 
and  0 ≤ X2  ≤ a.  G(a + ε)  for  this  case  is  computed  as  follows:

Let  G(a) = Aa2  + B a + C . Since G(0) = 0,  we  have  C  = 0.  From  the  diﬀerential  equation, 

2Aa + B = 

−2Aa2  − 2B a 
a 

+ 2a = (2 − 2A)a − 2B 

It  gives  A =  1  and  B  = 0.  Therefore

Problem 2  (Kang,  2001) 

Let  X1  and  X2  denote  the  locations  of  the  response  vehicle  and  an  event,  respectively. 

(i)  The  probability  that  the  presence  of  the  barrier  increases  the  grid  distance  the  vehicle  must 
travel  to  the  event,  P (B ),  is  given  by  (refer  to  the  ﬁgure  below) 

P (B ) = P (X1  ∈ I, X2  ∈ III) + P (X1  ∈ III, X2  ∈ I) + P (X1  ∈ II, X2  ∈ IV) + P (X1  ∈ IV, X2  ∈ II) 
= 2P (X1  ∈ I, X2  ∈ III) + 2P (X1  ∈ II, X2  ∈ IV)

Let  De  denote  the  extra  distance  the  vehicle  should  travel  due  to  the  barrier.  Let  us  ﬁrst 
compute  E [De  |  X1  ∈  I, X2  ∈  III].  There  is  no  extra  travel  distance  in  the  y  axis,  i.e. 
E [De  | X1  ∈ I, X2  ∈ III] = 0.  We  also  know  from  class  that  the  extra  travel  distance  in  the  x
y 
× 2 =  4

axis,  E [De  | 
x  X1  ∈ I, X2  ∈ 
III],  is  3

E [De  | X1  ∈ I, X2  ∈ III] =

By  symmetry,


E [De  | X1  ∈ III, X2  ∈ I] =

Now  consider  E [De  |  X1  ∈  II, X2  ∈  IV].  As  before,  E [De  |  X1  ∈  II, X2  ∈  IV] = 0.  To 
y 
compute  E [De  |  X1  ∈  II, X2  ∈  IV],  we  should  note  that  it  is  possible  to  travel  through  the 
x 
both  ends  of  the  barrier  spanning  from  (2, 4)  to  (4, 4).  We  saw  in  a  problem  set  when  travel 
1 
times the  length 
is allowed  through  the both ends of the barrier, the extra  travel  distance  is 
3
of  the  barrier  (refer  to  Problem  3.14  in  the  textbook).  Therefore,

By  symmetry,


E [De ]  is  then  computed  by

E [De  | X1  ∈ III, X2  ∈ I] P (X1  ∈ III, X2  ∈ I) + 
E [De  | X1  ∈ II, X2  ∈ IV] P (X1  ∈ II, X2  ∈ IV) +

Problem 3  (Odoni,  2001) 

(a)  If  the  PDF  of  service  time  is  negative  exponential,  the  state  transition  diagram  of  Vincent’s 
barbershop  queueing  system  is  given  by

For the case where λ = µ, we have the following balance equations and normalization equation: 

P0  = P1 

P1  = P2 

P2  = P3 

P0  + P1  + P2  + P3  = 1 

Solving  equations,  we  have  P0  =  P1  =  P2  =  P3  =  1
4 .  The  expected  number  of  customers  in 
the  barbershop  is 

L = 1 × P1  + 2 × P2  + 3 × P3  =

(b)  Suppose  there  are  k  chairs  (including  the  barber’s  chair)  in  the  barbershop,  which  is  to  be 
determined.  The  balance  equations  and  the  normalization  equation  in  this  case  are  given  by

for  n = 0, 1, · · ·  , k − 1 
Pn  = Pn+1 , 
P0  + P1  + · · · + Pk  = 1

Clearly,  P0  =  P1  =  · · ·  =  Pk  = 
k+1   .  To  make  sure  that  at  least  92%  of  his  prospective 
customers  become  actual  customers,  the  probability  that  a  new  customer  ﬁnds  all  chairs 
occupied,  Pk ,  should  be  less  than  8%. 

Pk  =

< 0.08  ⇒  k > 11.5 

The minimum  number  of  chairs  he  will  need  in  the  shop  is  12.

(c)  The  state  transition  diagram  for  SIRO  will  be  the  same  as  that  for  FIFO.  This  means  that 
the  steady-state  probabilities  Pn  will  be  identical  in  the  two  cases.  Then  L =

It  gives  ρ  =  1  (the  other  root,  − 4 
3 ,  is  meaningless).  Note  that  the  actual  arrival  rate  of 
customers  is  λ(cid:2)  = λ(1 − P2 ).  Since  40,000  customers  received  service  during  10,000  hours, 

λ(1 − P2 ) = 

40, 000
