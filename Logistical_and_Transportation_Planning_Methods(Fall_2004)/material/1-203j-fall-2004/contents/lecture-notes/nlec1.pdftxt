Shortest Path Problem 

•  Find the shortest path between two 
nodes, starting at Node O and ending 
at Node D. 
_ O:  Origin node 
_  D:  Destination node 

•  More generally: find least cost path	

Node Labeling Algorithm:  
Dijkstra 
•  Shortest path from a node 
•  k=1, start at origin node 
•  At the end of iteration k, the set of k 
CLOSED NODES consists of the k  closest 
nodes to the origin. 
•  Each OPEN NODE adjacent to one or
more closed nodes has our current 'best 
guess' of the minimal distance to that
node. 

Minimum Spanning Tree 
(MST) Problem 
•  Assume an undirected graph 
•  Problem:  Find a shortest length 
spanning tree of G(N, A). 
Why is this an important problem? 
If |N|=n, then each spanning tree 
contains (n-1) links. 
•  MST may not be unique 

• 
• 

MST 

Greedy algorithm works! 
• 
Start at an arbitrary node.  
•  Algorithm: 
Keep connecting to the growing sub-
tree the closest unattached node. 
Fundamental property: The shortest 
link out of any sub-tree (during the 
construction of the MST) must be a part 
of the MST 

•

of shortest length out of any node is 
part of the MST.

MST vs. Steiner Problem in 
the Euclidean Plane 
•  MST: All links must be rooted in the 
node set, N, to be connected 
•  MST is an easy problem 

•  Steiner problem: Links can be rooted at 
any point on the plane 
The Steiner problem is, in general, very 
difficult

Find the minimum length tour (or 
cycle) that “covers” every link of a 
network at least once 

• 

Will look at the CPP on an 
undirected network 

•	

The CPP on undirected graphs: 
Background 
•	 EULER TOUR: A tour which traverses every 
edge of a graph exactly once. 	
If we can find an Euler tour on G(N,A), this is 
clearly a solution to the CPP. 
•	 The DEGREE of a node is the number of 
edges that are incident on this node. 
•	 Euler’s Theorem (1736): A connected 
undirected graph, G(N, A), has an Euler tour 
iff it contains exactly zero nodes of odd 
degree. [If G(N, A) contains exactly two 
nodes of odd degree, then an Euler PATH 
exists.] 

The number of odd degree nodes in a 
graph is always even! 
1.  Each edge has two incidences. 
2.  Therefore, the total number of incidences, P, is 
an even number. 
3.	 The total number of incidences, Pe, on the 
even-degree nodes is an even number. 
4.  Therefore, the total number of incidences, Po, 
on the odd-degree nodes (Po  = P - Pe) is an
even number. 
5.	 But Po  is the number of incidences on odd-
degree nodes. For Po  to be even, it must be 
that m, the number of odd-degree nodes, is 
also even.

Drawing an Euler Tour 

• 

It is easy to draw manually an Euler 
Just 
tour on a network that has one.  
do not traverse an “isthmus”, i.e., an 
edge whose erasure will divide the 
yet 
part of the network into two 
uncovered 
separate, non-empty sub-networks.

The CPP Algorithm (Undirected 
Graph) [continued] 
STEP 3: Modify G(N, A) by adding to it 
the set, M, of (dummy) edges 
corresponding to the minimum-cost 
pair-wise matching found in STEP 2.  
Call this augmented graph G'. 
[G'(N, A∪M)] 
STEP 4: Find an Euler tour on G'.  
tour is a solution to the CPP.

• 

BASIC IDEA: Take the given graph, G(N, A), 
and add “dummy” edges to it, until G has no 
odd degree nodes.  In adding edges, try to 
add as little length as possible to G. 
STEP 1: Identify all  nodes of odd degree on 
m

G(N, A). [Remember m 
STEP 2: Find the minimum-cost, pairwise 
of the odd-degree nodes.  [Apply 
matching 
the “non-bipartite matching” algorithm (a.k.a. 
“flower and blossom” of Ellis and Johnson 
(1972) – see Chapter 12 of Ahuja, Magnanti 
and Orlin.

The Solution	

Number of Matches 

•  Pair-wise matches: 	
1.  {A-D, E-B},  “cost” = 12	
2.  {A-B, D-E},  “cost” = 16	
3.	 {A-E, B-D},  “cost” = 20 
•  Select “1”. 
•  Total CPP tour length = 48 + 12 = 60 
•  A tour: {A, B, C, A, D, C, E, B, E, D, A}

Solving Manually on a Graph 

• 

•  Given a good “map”, it is possible to solve 
manually, to near-optimality, large CPPs on 
planar graphs. 
KEY OBSERVATION: In a minimum-cost, pair (cid:173)
wise matching of the odd degree nodes, no two 
shortest paths in the matching can have any 
edges in common. 
•  IMPLICATIONS: 
Eliminate large no. of potential matches 
_ 
Search only in “neighborhood” of each odd-
_ 
degree node 

Related CPP Problems 

• 

• 

CPP on directed graphs can also be solved 
efficiently (in polynomial time) [Problem 6.6 in 
L+O] 
•  CPP on mixed graph is a “hard” problem 
[Papadimitriou, 1976] 
Many variations and applications: 
Snow plowing 
_ 
Street sweeping 
_ 
Mail delivery => “multi-postmen” 
_ 
CPP with time windows 
_ 
_  Rural CPP 

Applications 

•	 Each of these problem types has been 
greatly refined and expanded over the 
years 
•	 Each can be implemented via computer 
in complex operating environments 
•	 The Post office, FedEx, truckers, even 
bicycled couriers use these techniques
