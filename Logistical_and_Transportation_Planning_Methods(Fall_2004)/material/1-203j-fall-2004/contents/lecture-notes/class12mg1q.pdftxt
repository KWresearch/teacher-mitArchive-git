The  M/G/1  Queueing  System 

For  the M/G/1  queueing  system being operated under  the FIFO  service  rule, we derive  the expres-
sions  of the  following  quantities  in  terms  of the  arrival  rate  λ,  the mean  service  time E [S ],  and  the 
variance  of service  time  σ2 
S . 

•	 W :  the  average  time  a  randomly  arriving  customer  will  spend  in  the  system,  which  is  com-
posed  of the  waiting  time  in  the  queue  and  the  service  time. 

•	 L:  the  average  number  of people  in  the  system  that  a  randomly  arriving  customer  ﬁnds, 
which  is  composed  of the  number  of people  in  the  queue  and  the  person  in  service. 

•	 ρ:  the  long  run  fraction  of  time  the  server  is  busy,  which  is  equivalently  the  probability  that 
the  server  is  busy  at  a  random  point  in  time. 

•	 B :  the  long  run  average  duration  of a  server  busy  period. 

Recall that the M/G/1 queueing system is a single server queueing system in which the customer 
arrival  process  is  Poisson  with  rate  λ  and  the  service  time,  S ,  for  each  customer  follows  a  general 
distribution  with  PDF  fS (s),  mean  E [S ],  and  variance  σ2 
S .	 Let  us  ﬁrst  compute  ρ  and  B . 
∗
Suppose we  have  been watching  the  queueing  system  for  a  very  very  long  time,  say  T  minutes 
∗
where  T 
is  very  large.  If we  recorded  the  number  of minutes  the  server  was  busy  during  this  long 
∗
period  of time  and  then  divided  it  by  T  ,  we  would  obtain  ρ,  the  long  run  fraction  of  time  the 
∗	
∗
server  is  busy.  During  the  long period  of time T  , we would  expect  there  have  been λT  customers 
arriving  to  the  queueing  system,  each  of who  takes  on  average  E [S ]  minutes  to  be  served.  This 
means

To compute B ,  the  long  run average  length  of a  server busy period, we again  think of observing 
the  system  for  a  long  period  of time.  During  this  long  period  of time,  there  occur  a  large  number, 
say  N ,  of busy  periods.  Since  every  busy  period  is  followed  by  an  idle  period,  we  could  say  that 
the  number  of idle  periods  is  N  as  well.  (The  diﬀerence  between  the  number  of busy  periods  and 
the  number  of idle  periods  would  be  at  most  one,  and  this  is  negligible  compared  to  N .).  Since 
the  average  length  of a  busy period  is B  and  the  number of busy periods  is N ,  the  total  amount  of 
time  the  server  is  busy,  over  the  the  long  period  of time  we  are  observing,  is  N B .

The  length  of an  idle  period  is,  on  average,  1/λ  since  an  idle  period  occurs  when  the  server  is 
waiting  for a customer  to arrive after the queue becomes empty.  Since the arrival process is Poisson 
and  therefore memoryless,  the  server will wait  a negative  exponentially  distributed amount  of  time 
until  the next customer  arrives.  Therefore  if  there  are N  idle periods,  the  total  amount  of time  the 
server  is  idle  is  N/λ.  The  fraction  of  time  the  server  is  busy,  ρ,  can  now  be  computed  by 

ρ =

N B 
(N B + N/λ)  B +  1  .

Solving  for  B  and  using  ρ = λE [S ],  we  have

Let  T  be  a  random  variable  denoting  the  amount  of time  that  a  randomly  arriving  customer, 
say  I,  will  spend  in  the  system.  Our  goal  is  to  compute  W  = E [T ].  Note  that  we  can  decompose 
T  into  the  following  three  random  variables: 

•  T1 ,  the  remaining  service  time  of the  customer  currently  in  service. 

•  T2 ,  the  time  required  to  serve  the  customers  waiting  ahead  of me  in  the  queue. 

•  T3 , my  service  time. 

Clearly, W  = E [T1 ] + E [T2 ] + E [T3 ].  Since  the  expected  service  time  for  each  customer  is E [S ], 
we  have 

E [T3 ] = E [S ] . 

To obtain E [T2 ], we ﬁrst compute the conditional  expectation  of T2  given  that  there are already 
n  customers  in  the  system  when  I,  a  randomly  arriving  customer,  arrive  in  the  system.  Since  one 
� 
customer  is  being  served  and  n − 1  customers  are  waiting  in  the  queue, 

E [T2  | n] = 

(n − 1)E [S ], n ≥ 1, 
n = 0.

Note  that 

Pn  = ρ. So  we  have 

E [T2 ] = E [S ]L − E [S ]ρ . 

Now  let us compute E [T1 ].  Since the service  time distribution may not be negative  exponential, 
we  should  consider  the  issue  of  random  incidence.  Note  that  I,  a  randomly  arriving  customer,  am 
more  likely  to  join  the  queueing  system when  the duration  of the  current  service  is  long  than when 
it  is  short,  because  long  services  take  up more of the  time horizon.  The expected  remaining  service 
time  for  the  customer  in  service  when  I  randomly  arrive  in  the  system  is  given  by  (see  Equation

We now have one linear relationship between L and W .  Combining this with Little’s Law, L = λW , 
we  have  two  equations  for  two  unknowns, L  and W .  A  little  algebra  gives  us
