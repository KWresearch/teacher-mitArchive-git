Two common “approximations” (??) 
for dynamic demand profiles 
1.	 Find the average demand per unit of time 
for the time interval of interest and then 
use steady-state expressions to compute 
estimates of the queuing statistics. 
[Problems?] 
2.	 Subdivide the time interval of interest into 
periods during which demand stays 
roughly constant; apply steady-state 
expressions to each period separately. 
[Problems?] 

Problems 
with the Approximate Methods 
Problems with Approach 1: 
•	
1.	 For cases in which demand varies significantly (e.g., 
>10% from overall average value) the delay estimates 
can be VERY poor 
2.	 Will underestimate overall average delay, possibly by a 
lot 
Problems with Approach 2: 
•	
1.	 May not have ρ< 1, for some intervals; then what? 
2.	 Time to reach “steady state” is large for values of ρ 
which are close to 1; therefore “steady state” 
expressions may be very poor approximations when 
intervals are relatively short 
3.	 Approach does not take into consideration the
“dynamics” of the demand profile  

The Two Viable Approaches 

1. 	 Simulation: 
•	 High level of detail 
•	 May be only viable alternative for complex 
systems 
•	 Statistical significance of results? 
2. 	 Numerical solution of equations
describing the evolution of queueing 
system over time: 
Increasingly practical 
•	
•	 May provide lots of information, such as Pn(t)  

Dynamic Behavior of Queues 

1. The dynamic behavior of a queue can be complex 
and difficult to predict
2. Expected delay changes non-linearly with 
changes in the demand rate or the capacity 
3. The closer the demand rate is to capacity, the 
more sensitive expected delay becomes to 
changes in the demand rate or the capacity 
4. The time when peaks in expected delay occur 
may lag behind the time when demand peaks 
5. The expected delay at any given time depends on 
the “history” of the queue prior to that time 
6. The variance (variability) of delay also increases 
when the demand rate is close to capacity 

The dynamic behavior of a queue; expected delay 
for four different levels of capacity

Congestion pricing: 
The basic observation 
•	 The congestion costs due to any specific user 
have 2 components: 
(1) Cost of delay to that user (internal cost) 
(2) Cost of delay to all other users caused by that user 
(external cost) 

•	 At congested facilities, this second component 
can be very large 

•	 A congestion toll can be imposed to force
users to experience this cost component  (to
“internalize the external costs”) 

Economic principle 

Optimal use of a transportation facility cannot be 
achieved unless each additional (marginal) 
user pays for all the additional costs that this 
user imposes on all other users and on the 
facility itself.  A congestion toll not only 
contributes to maximizing social economic 
welfare, but is also necessary to reach such a 
(Vickrey, 1967, 1969; Carlin + Park, 
result. 
1970) 

Two hard technical problems 

• 
(1) 

In practice it is very hard to: 
Estimate external marginal delay costs  
(extensive data analysis and/or simulation 
have been typically needed – subtle issues); 

(2)  Determine equilibrium  congestion tolls (trial-
and-error approach that may take long time to 
converge) 

• 

Queueing theory has much to offer (especially
with regard to the first problem) under certain
conditions. 

Computing Internal and External 
Costs 
Consider a queueing facility with a single type of users in 
steady-state. Let 
= delay cost per unit time per user 
c 
= total cost of delay per unit time incurred in the system

Then:

and the marginal delay cost, 
, imposed by an 
MC 
additional (“marginal”) user is given by: 
dW q

MC = 
= c W q  + cλ

Numerical Example 

•	 Three types of aircraft; Poisson; FIFO service 
_  Non-jets:  λ1  = 40 per hour; c1 = $600 per hour 
_  Narrow-body jets:  λ2  = 40 per hour; c2 = $1,800 per hour 
_  Wide-body jets:  λ3  = 10 per hour; c3 = $4,200 per hour 
_  Total demand is: λ= λ1  + λ2  + λ3  = 90 per hour 
•	 pdf for service times is uniform 
_  U[25 sec, 47 sec] 
_  E[S] = 36 sec = 0.01 hour;  µ= 100 per hour

giving: 

MC ( i ) = 

dC

dW q 
= ci W q  + cλ

• When we have explicit expressions for Wq, we 
can also compute explicitly the total marginal 
MC(i), the internal (or private) cost 
delay cost 
and the external cost associated with each 
additional user of type 
i

Important to note… 

•  The external costs computed, in the 
absence of congestion pricing, give only 
an upper bound on the magnitude of the 
congestion-based fees that might be 
charged 
•  These are not “equilibrium prices” 
•  Equilibrium prices may turn out to be 
considerably less than these upper bounds 
•  Equilibrium prices are hard to estimate, 
absent knowledge of demand functions 

Case of LaGuardia (LGA) 

•	 Since 1969: Slot-based High Density Rule (HDR) 
_  DCA, JFK, LGA, ORD; “buy-and-sell” since 1985 
•	 Early 2000: About 1050 operations per weekday at LGA 
•	 April 2000: Air-21 (Wendell-Ford Aviation Act for 21st Century) 
Immediate exemption from HDR for aircraft seating 70 or fewer pax 
_	
on service between small communities and LGA 
•	 By November 2000 airlines had added over 300 movements per 
day; more planned: virtual gridlock at LGA 
•	 December 2000: FAA and PANYNJ implemented slot lottery and 
announced intent to develop longer-term policy for access to LGA 
•	 Lottery reduced LGA movements by about 10%; dramatic reduction 
in LGA delays 
•	 June 2001:  Notice for Public Comment posted with regards to 
longer-term policy that would use “market-based” mechanisms 
•	 Process stopped after September 11, 2001; re-opened recently
