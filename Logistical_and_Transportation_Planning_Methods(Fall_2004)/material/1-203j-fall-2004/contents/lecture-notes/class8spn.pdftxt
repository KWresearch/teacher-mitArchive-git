Suppose that emergency vehicles are distributed over a region under a spatial 
Poisson process with parameter Î».  Let vi be the straight-line distance from point P to 
the ith nearest emergency vehicle.   We seek P(v2 > 2v1), which is the chance that the 
second-nearest vehicle is more than twice as far from P as the nearest one. 

As a start, suppose that v2 = Q.  Then, we know that there is exactly one vehicle 
in the circle of radius Q centered at P.   (Right?)    Under the Poisson assumption, that 
vehicle is equally likely to be anywhere within that circle. 

The event v2 > 2v1 requires in this instance that v1 < Q/2.  We know that the 
vehicle nearest P is uniformly distributed over a circle with radius Q,  and need the 
probability that it falls within the circle of radius Q/2 centered at P.   That probability is 
simply 1/4, because the smaller circle has half the radius of the larger one and thus only 
one quarter the area.  To put it another way, 25% of the points within distance Q of P are 
within distance Q/2. 

This result is conditioned on the fact that v2 = Q, but it is obvious that the same 
outcome would arise whatever the value of v2.  Thus, P(v2 > 2v1) = 0.25.  The chances 
are 75% that the second nearest vehicle is less than twice as far from P as the nearest one. 

What is happening here is that the distance from P to the kth nearest vehicle does 
not rise linearly with k.   On average, the area we have to search to find the vehicle 
second nearest to P is twice as large as that to find the nearest.   But area varies with the 
square of distance from P, so doubling the area typically involves a rise in distance tied 
to the square root of 2, which is 1.41.
