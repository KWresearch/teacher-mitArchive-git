Congestion Pricing 
 
Congestion costs due to any specific user have 2 components: 
 
(1) Cost of delay to that user (internal) 
 
(2) Cost of delay to all other users caused by that user (external) 
 
--At congested airports (and congested facilities, in general) this second 
component can be very large 

 
--A congestion toll can be imposed to force users to experience this cost 
component  (to internalize the external costs) 

 
Economic principle 
 
Optimal use of a transportation facility cannot be achieved unless each additional 
(marginal) user pays for all the additional costs that this user imposes on all 
other users and onthe facility itself.  Thus, a congestion toll not only contributes 
to a socially desirable result, but is necessary to reach such a result.  (Vickrey, 
1967; Carlin + Park, 1970)  
 
Congestion Pricing and Queueing Theory 
 
In practice it is very hard to: 
 
(1)  Estimate external marginal delay costs (extensive data analysis or difficult 
simulation is typically needed); 

 
(2)  Determine equilibrium  congestion tolls (trial-and error approach that may 
take long time to converge is used sometimes). 
 
conditions. 
Queueing theory has much to offer in these two respects under certain

The Principal Observation 
 
Consider a queueing facility with a single type of customer in steady-state. 
 
Let  
 
c = delay cost per unit time per customer 
 
C = total cost of delay per unit time incurred in the system at equilibrium 
 
Then:   
 
and the marginal delay cost, MC, imposed by an additional (“marginal”) 
customer is given by:

Note that the first term on the right is the “internal cost” experienced by the 
marginal customer and the second term is the “external cost” (s)he imposes! 
 
These ideas can be extended to cases with multiple types of customers and to 
systems with priorities.

For many types of queueing systems explicit expressions for W are available.  (1)

Extension 1 

 
• Similar analysis can be applied (and closed form results obtained) in cases in 
which customers are assigned priorities for service depending on their type. 
 
• Note that in this case, each type of customer i experiences a different expected 
time in the system,   W qi , depending on their priority. 
 
• Many important practical applications.

Some Additional Issues   
 
Toll may vary in time and by location 
 
Facility users may be driven by  “network” considerations 
 
“Social benefit” considerations
