Wall of Shame 

Assume a square city of side L, with the borders going North→South and 
East→West.   A malicious mayor decides to create an East→West barrier a distance x 
north of the city’s southern border, which will have only one opening through which 
vehicles can pass.   Assume that his objective is to increase to the greatest extent possible 
the mean grid distance between two random points in the square.   In pursuit of this goal: 

(1)  Where should he place the opening in the barrier? 

(2)  What value of x should he choose? 

Solution 

As is intuitively clear, the opening should be at the end of the barrier, either on the 
Eastern edge of the city or the Western.    That way, every trip that requires crossing the 
barrier will involve greater East→West distance than it would absent the barrier.  The 
extra East→West distance will average 2L/3  (L/2 + L/2 – L/3). An opening elsewhere 
would have less than 100% chance of increasing East→West distance when the barrier is 
crossed, and the mean increase given that one occurred would be less than 2L/3. 

If the barrier is x units north of the city’s Southern border, then the city is divided 
into two rectangles, one of area Lx and the other of area L(L-x).   (We assume, of course, 
that x < L.)  Thus, if two points are chosen at random over the city, the probability that 
one of them is north of the barrier and the other south is  2Lx[L(L-x)]/L4.  (See why?) 
This quantity is a numerical constant times x(L-x).   The value of x that maximizes the 
expression is found by setting the appropriate derivative equal to 0, which quickly leads 
to the outcome x = L/2.     

In short, the barrier should divide the city into two halves, and travelers between 
the two sectors should have to travel to the edge of the city to get through.  As in Berlin, 
however, such a barrier cannot be expected to last forever.
