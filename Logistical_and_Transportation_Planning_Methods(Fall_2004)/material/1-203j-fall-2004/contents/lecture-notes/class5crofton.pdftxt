Crofton’s  Method 

Let  X1  and  X2  be  independent  random  variables  that  are  uniformly  distributed  over  the  interval 
[0, a].  We  are  interested  in  computing E [|X1  − X2 |].  For  instance,  in  an  urban  setting,  X1  and X2 
may  denote  the  location  of  an  accident  and  the  location  where  an  emergency  vehicle  is  currently 
parked  in  a  road  segment  of  length  a,  respectively.  In  this  case,  we  want  to  know  the  distance  (or 
the  travel  time)  on  average  between  the  two  locations,  E [|X1  − X2 |].  We  may  solve  this  question 
using  a  joint  distribution  of  X1  and  X2 ,  but  Crofton’s method  is  quite  useful  for  the  question. 
Let  G(a)  ≡  E [|X1  − X2 |].  Now  consider  the  following  question:  If   the   interval   were   [0, a + ε] 
where  ε is  smal  l,  what  would  G(a + ε)  be?  Table 1  summarizes G(a + ε) depending on  the  locations 
of  X1  and X2 .

Note  that  we  did  not  specify  G(a + ε)  for  the  case  where  a < X1  ≤ a + ε and  a < X2  ≤ a + ε, 
ε
because  the  probability  of  that  case,  ( a+ε )2  ,  is  negligible  when  ε  is  small  (“If  ε  is  small,  ε2  is 
pathetic.”). 
To  compute G(a + ε)  from Table 1, we  invoke  the  total  expectation  theorem  (or  the  conditional 
expectation  rule).  When  a  sample  space  is  divided  into A1 , A2 , . . . , An  that  are mutually  exclusive 
and  collectively  exhaustive  events,  the  expected  value  of  a  random  variable  Z  is  computed  by

where  o(ε2 )  is  a  collection  of  terms  of  order  ε2  or  higher.  If  ε  is  small,  we  can  ignore  o(ε2 ).  Hence 
we  have

Therefore,  we  can  rewrite G(a + ε) as

If  ε → 0,  we  have  the  following  diﬀerential  equation:

(a) = −

+ 1  . 

Now  let  us  “guess”  that  G(a) = C + B a, where  C  and  B  are  some  constants.  Since  G(0) =  0,  we 
have  C = 0.  From  the  diﬀerential  equation  above,  we  obtain 

Therefore

Crofton’s method can be used  to compute E [max(X1 , X2 )] as well.  In  this  case,  there  are  slight 
changes  in G(a + ε) as  shown  in Table 2.  Following  a procedure similar  to  one we  just used, we  can 
show  that 

G(a) = E [max(X1 , X2 )] =
