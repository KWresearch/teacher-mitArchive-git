Problem Set 3 
(Due:  Monday, October 18, 2004) 

 
Problem 1: The Hurricane season 
 
Consider a Hurricane that is currently heading in a direction perpendicular to the Florida 
cost directly towards  Miami. Assume the center of the hurricane is currently 1 unit away 
from Miami (see figure below). Assume also that at the current point (1 unit away) the 
hurricane’s path is about to change instantly. Assume that the direction in which the 
hurricane will head with respect to the coast is a random variable uniformly distributed 
between -90 and +90 degrees.  Officials know that, if the center of the hurricane hits a 
point along the coast within 1 unit of distance from Miami then Miami will have to be 
evacuated

A.  Find the probability Miami will need to be evacuated. 
B.  Calculate the PDF for the point where the hurricane center will hit the coast, 
assuming Miami is the origin. 

Hurricane Center 

 
Now assume that, instead of currently being one unit away from Miami, and heading at a 
90-degree angle towards the coast, the hurricane is one unit away from Miami and the 
straight line that connects it with Miami forms a 30 degree angle with the coastline. This 
is shown below.

Hurricane Center 

 

 
Assume, as in part A, that at this instant the hurricane may change direction.  Let us draw 
the perpendicular to the current direction (Brown Line). Assume that the direction that 
the hurricane will head with respect to the brown line (Not the Coast!) is a random 
variable uniformly distributed between -90 and +90 degrees. 
 
C.  Find the probability Miami will need to be evacuated in this case. 
D. [FOR EXTRA CREDIT.]  Calculate the PDF of where the hurricane center will hit the 
coast (NOTE: Not the Brown Line), assuming Miami is the origin. 
 
Problem 2 
 
Suppose that emergency vehicles are distributed under a spatial Poisson process with 
parameter λ, and let x(k) be the straight-line distance between some point O and the  
k-th nearest vehicle.  
 

(a)  Obtain an expression for the mean of x(2).   
(b)  Find the probability that x(5) > 3x(2). 

 
Problem 3 
 
Problem 4.1 in the text.  [Hint:  The key here is to model the situation correctly, i.e., to 
identify correctly the states of this system.  Note, for example, that we cannot have a 
positive number of passengers and of taxis at the taxi station simultaneously.] 
 
Problem 4 
 
Consider a M/M/2 queueing facility with no queue allowed (i.e., arrivals when both 
servers are busy do not receive service and are lost).  Arrivals occur at the rate of λ per 

hour while each server provides service at the rate of µ per hour. Let ρ = (λ/µ) and 
assume that each server is operated by one man. 
 

(a)  With the system in steady state, what is the expected number of men who are 
busy serving a customer at any given time?  Your answer should be solely in 
terms of ρ. 

 
Each man working at the facility records the number of hours required to service each 
customer and the number of customers he serves.  The following data were collected over 
a long period of time:  During 10,000 hours of the facility’s operation, 40,000 customers 
received service and 8,000 man hours of service were recorded.  (This last number is the 
total number of hours when the two men were busy, not necessarily simultaneously, 
serving customers.)  Assume the sample is large enough to provide reliable statistical 
information. 
 

(b) Estimate the number of customers lost during these 10,000 hours. 

 
Problem 5 
 
The ABC Automobile Rental Company must choose between operating one of two types 
of maintenance shops for its cars.  It estimates that cars will arrive at the maintenance 
facility in a Poisson manner at the rate of one every 40 minutes.  In the first type of shop, 
there is a single server, which can service a car in 15 minutes on average, with a negative 
exponential service time.  In the second type, there are two identical servers operating in 
parallel; each can service a car in 30 minutes on average with a service time described 
again by a negative exponential pdf.  Assume that each minute a car must spend in the 
shop costs ABC 1 monetary unit.  Let C1 and C2 be the cost per minute of operating the 
first and second type facilities, respectively.  Find the value of the difference between C1 
and C2, such that ABC would be indifferent between operating the two types of facilities.  
Which of C1 and C2 is the larger at this critical value? 
 
Problem 6 
 
Consider a single server queueing system whose customers arrive in a Poisson manner at 
a rate of λ customers per minute.  There is infinite queue capacity and customers are 
served in a FCFS manner.  This system is similar to our familiar M/M/1 system, but with 
one important difference: 
 
The FIRST customer to arrive in a busy period (i.e., every customer who arrives to find 
the system in the idle state) has a service time, which is Erlang of order 2, with mean 
service time equal to 2/µ minutes.  In other words, the server gets the busy period off to a 
“slow start,” requiring an average of twice the time to serve the customer who starts the 
busy period.  All service times are independent. 
 
Note that the service times of all the other customers (i.e., of those who are not the first to 
arrive after a busy period) have the more usual negative exponential probability density 

function with mean 1/µ.  Note, as well, that for the first customer in a busy period, one 
may think of the service being carried out sequentially in two phases: each phase has a 
duration drawn from a negative exponential probability density function with mean 1/µ 
and the two phases are independent. 
 

(a)  If the queueing system had zero queue capacity, meaning that all approaching 
customers who arrived when the server was busy would be “lost” or “turned 
away,” then every customer who is served would initiate a busy period and have 
Erlang order 2 service time density.  Argue carefully and briefly that in steady 
state one can solve this system using a state-transition diagram having three 
states, one for server idle and two for server busy.  Draw the 3-state transition 
diagram and define the states of the system.  (Hint:  Think in terms of remaining 
“phases” of work.)  Use this model to find an expression for the server utilization 
in this case, i.e., for the fraction of time the server is busy (= the probability that 
the server is busy at any random time). 

 
For the remainder of this problem, we assume the more usual infinite capacity, first-
come, first-served system, but with the important difference from M/M/1 noted 
earlier. 
 

(b) Generalize the idea of part (a) to carefully draw and label the state-transition 
diagram of the infinite capacity queue system that we have described.  Note that 
with the exception of the first three states, your diagram will look very similar to 
that of the M/M/1 model, BUT the state of the system is NOT the number of 
customers in the system, but rather the number of service phases (each with mean 
equal to 1/µ) in the system. 

 
(c)  What condition must be satisfied for this system to reach steady state? [Hint: The 
condition is a very simple one.)   Derive an expression for the server utilization in 
this case (assuming steady state exists). 

 
Assume steady state conditions from here on. 
 

 

 

(d) What fraction of customers experience the “Erlang order 2” service time? 

(e)  What is the expected service time for a random customer utilizing this system?  

(f)  [FOR EXTRA CREDIT].  Find L, Lq, W and Wq.  You will find it easiest to begin 
with Wq.
