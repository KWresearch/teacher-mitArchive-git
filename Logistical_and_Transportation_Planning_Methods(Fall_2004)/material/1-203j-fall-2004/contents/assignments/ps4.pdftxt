Problem Set 4 
(Due:  Monday, November 8, 2004) 

                  Fall 2004 

Problem 1 
 
Consider a service facility at which Type 1 and Type 2 customers arrive in a Poisson 
manner at the rate of λ1= 30 per hour and λ2= 24 per hour, respectively.  Service at the 
facility is FIFO and service times are constant and last exactly 1 minute for either type of 
customer.  The cost of waiting in the queue per minute is $2 and $3 per Type 1 and Type 
2 customers, respectively.  Assume steady state conditions throughout the problem.  
Numerical answers are expected in all parts. 
 

(a)  Suppose that George begins observing the queueing system at a random time 
(assume the system is in steady state).  [George is not a customer – he is just an 
observer.] What is the expected time until George observes the first completion of 
a service?  
(b) What is the total expected cost of waiting time at this facility per hour?  
(c)  Find the internal cost and the external cost associated with a marginal Type 1 
customer and repeat for the internal and external cost associated with a Type 2 
customer.  How do the external costs compare and why? 

 
Assume now and for the remainder of this problem that service to Type 1 customers lasts 
exactly 0.5 minute and to Type 2 customers exactly 1.625 minutes.  The cost of waiting 
per minute is still $2 and $3 per Type 1 and Type 2 customers, respectively.   
 

(d)  Repeat part (a). 
(e)  Repeat part (b).  A numerical answer is expected once again. 
(f)  Repeat part (c) and comment on some of the differences you see with the results 
of part (c). 

 
Suppose now that you were asked to assign non-preemptive priorities to the two types of 
customers in a way that will minimize the total expected cost of waiting at the facility. 
 

(g) Which type of customer should be assigned higher priority and why? 
(h)  Under the priorities assigned in part (g), what is the total expected cost of waiting 
at this facility per hour?  How does this cost compare with the cost you found in 
part (e)?

priority M/M/1 systems that has been posted on our website. 
 

Problem 3 
 
Airline DeeDee has only three airplanes.  (There are many small airlines of this size 
around the world.)  DeeDee has signed a contract with the ABC Corporation under which 
ABC will provide unscheduled, non-routine repair services to DeeDee when aircraft 
suffer mechanical breakdowns.  The service times to aircraft at ABC’s repair facility have 
a negative exponential pdf with a mean value of 12 hours.  However, it has been observed 
that, with probability 0.6, an aircraft will need a second, supplementary repair operation 
after the first repair is completed.  (With probability 0.4, the first repair is satisfactory and 
the aircraft goes back to flying.)  The service times for the second repair, if needed, also 
have a negative exponential pdf with a mean of 12 hours.  After the second repair 
operation, the aircraft is always in a “satisfactory” state for flying.  The repair facility 
services only one aircraft at a time and will perform all repair operations on an aircraft 
(one or two), before processing the next aircraft on a first come, first served basis.  
Finally, it is known that the time between the instant when repair service to an aircraft is 
completed and the instant when that aircraft will break down again for the first time has a 
negative exponential pdf with a mean of 3 days.  For the sake of simplicity, assume, as 
well, that both DeeDee and ABC operate continuously, on a 24-hours a day basis. 
 

(a)  Draw a state-transition diagram for this queueing system, making sure to define 
carefully its states. 
(b) What is the expected number of DeeDee aircraft in ABC’s repair facility in steady 
state?  This includes aircraft being repaired and aircraft waiting for repairs.     

  
 
 

 
Problem 4 
 
Problem 4.12 in L + O. 
 
Problem 5 
 
We have solved in class Example 3 of pages 246 and 247 in Larson and Odoni, assuming 
distinct service rates µ1 and µ2 at the two queueing facilities.  We shall now look at the 
case in which the first queueing system (the one on the left) has two independent and 
identical servers, each with service rate equal to µ1.  There is still no waiting space in 
front of either of the two facilities.   
 

(a)  Draw carefully the state-transition diagram (i.e., analogous to Figure 4.20) for this 
case.  Define clearly the states of the system.  Do NOT do any further 
calculations. 
(b)  Assume that you have computed the steady-state probabilities associated with the 
states in the state-transition diagram you drew in part (a).  Write an expression for 
L, the expected number of customers in this “network” (i.e., this two-queueing-
facility system) in terms of the steady-state probabilities.
