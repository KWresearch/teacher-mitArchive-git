Urban OR Problem Set 5 
Due In Class Wednesday, November 17 

Also this problem set is more difficult then the others and it is recommended that you 
start on it early as the concepts here combine everything else you have learned thus far. 

Problem #1.  Two Server Hypercube Problem 

Consider a 1-mile-by-2-mile homogeneous service region served by two mobile patrolling 
servers as shown in Figure 1.  Here are the assumptions of the model: 

1.	 Customer locations are uniformly independently located over the entire rectangular service 
region. 
2.	 Over time, customers arrive as a homogeneous Poisson process at aggregate rate λ=2 customers 
per hour. 
3.	 While not busy serving customers, each server patrols its sector (sector 1 or 2, respectively).  
Under this circumstance, the server’s location at a random time is uniformly distributed over its 
sector.  Each sector is a one-mile-by-one-mile square. 
4.	 Travel distance is right-angle (“Manhattan metric”), with speed equal to 1000 mi./hr. 
5.	 The on-scene time to serve a customer is a random variable having a negative exponential 
probability density function with mean equal to 30 minutes.  Upon completion of service of a 
customer at the scene, the server resumes random patrol of his/her sector. 
6.	 This is the dispatch strategy: For a customer from sector i (i=1,2), dispatch server i if available. 
Else dispatch the other server if available; Else the customer is lost forever.

Figure 1 

(a)  Is it true that the workload (fraction of time busy) of each server is equal to 1/2? 	  If true, briefly 
explain why.  If false, derive the correct figure. 
(b)  Determine the fraction of dispatches that take server 1 to sector 2. 
(c)  Determine the mean travel time to a random served customer. 

Now consider the situation as shown in Figure 2.  Assumptions 1 through 5 above remain 
correct.  However, Assumption 6 is altered as follows:  
Case in which both servers are available: For a customer from a part of sector i not in 
Buffer Zone i, dispatch server i.  For a customer in Buffer Zone i, dispatch the other 
server only if that other server is within its own buffer zone and server i is not within its 
buffer zone; else dispatch server i to that customer. 
Case in which only one server is available: Dispatch that server. 
Else the customer is lost forever. 

(d)  Under this new dispatch policy, determine the fraction of dispatch assignments that send server 1 
to sector 2. 
(e)  Without doing the detailed calculations, describe briefly how you would compute the mean 
travel time.  How would the magnitude of the numerical answer compare to that of part (c)? 
(f)  Suppose under the simpler dispatch policy #1 above, we find that the workload of Sector #1 is 
twice the workload of Sector 2, while λ remains the same at λ= 2.  Without doing the 
calculations, briefly explain how you would find an optimal boundary line separating Sectors 1 

and 2, where ‘optimal’ means minimizing mean travel time.  Would it be to the left of right of x 
= 0?  Why?

In the part about practical significance please try to think of a real word example where 
each case would arrive and explain why it is better than the other alternatives.
