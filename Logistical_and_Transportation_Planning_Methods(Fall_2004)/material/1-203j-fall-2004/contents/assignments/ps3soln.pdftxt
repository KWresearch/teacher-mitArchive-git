PROBLEM SET 3 SOLUTIONS 
_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Problem 1 
 

A.  In order to find this probability we need to find the angle such that the projection from the 
hurricane center maps to one unit away from Miami. Let us look at the following triangle.  

 

1 Unit 

90 

Miami 

1 Unit 

Hurricane Center 

 

 
 
Thus we need to find the pink Angel. We can observer that the triangle is an isosceles one since two of the 
sides are of length one. Thus we know the blue angle and pink angle must equal each other. Thus since 
these two angles add to 90, we know each is 45. Thus since the angle is uniform the probability that we 
need to evacuate Miami is: (45+45)/180=1/2 
 
 
B.  This is by definition the Cauchy Distribution. The complete derivation appears on page 118 of the 
text, please see this page if you were unable to derive the distribution. 
 
C. The key to this question was to split the problem into two cases. The first is if the angle chosen is 
negative, the second if the angle chosen is positive. Drawing triangles and projections as we did in part A 
gives us the following two triangles: 

Miami 

1 Unit 

1 Unit 

30 Angle 

1 Unit 

 
 

Hurricane Center 

 

Thus we have two triangles as shown above such that the projected angles(the orange and green) map to 
one unit off Miami. Thus if we look at the left triangle we have to lengths of one thus giving us an 
isosceles triangle. Thus we know that the two Angles opposite the 1 unit segments must be equal and add 
to 150, thus the orange angle is 75 degrees. For the right triangle we know the supplement of a 30 degree 
angle is 150. Thus since the angles opposite the two one unit segments are equal we know that they must 
add to 30, thus making each of them 15. Thus the probability the Miami is evacuated is (75+15)/180 = 
90/180 = ½ . 
 
 
Problem 2 
 

A.  Not Graded, Solution to be discussed.  

 

 

B.  Let us look at the following diagram without loss of generality we can fix the fifth nearest point 
at a distance at one unit away. Given this we know the other four points are uniformly 
distributed between 0 and 1 unit away from the center. In order for x(5)>3x(2) we need the 
second nearest neighbor to be outside a circle of radius 1/3.  Thus the probability given the 
distribution of being outside the circle or radius 1/3 is approximately 1-(1/9). This region is the 
inner region of the red circle in the picture below.  

 

 
Thus the probability that x(2) is not in the red circle is one minus the probability that no points are in the 
red circle(one way for this to happen) minus the probability that only one point is in the red circle 4 ways 
for this to happen. Thus the probability that x(5)>3x(2) is  
 
1-(8/9)4-4(1/9)(8/9)3, which is approximately 0.06 
 
 

Problem 3 (Ingolfsson, 1993)
A possible state transition diagram is shown below. Each state is described by two numbers, i
and j . i is the number of taxis waiting for passengers, and j is the number of passengers looking
for taxis. If there are taxis waiting for passengers, then no passengers will have to wait. If there
are passengers looking for taxis, there should be no taxis available. Thus, states with both i > 0
and j > 0 are not possible.
It is also possible to represent a state by a single number instead of two numbers. If we deﬁne
the state variable n as

n = (number of taxis waiting for passengers) − (number of passengers waiting for taxis) ,

then the corresponding state transition diagram is
Note that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between states in the two diagrams. For exam-
ple, the state with n = −3 in the second diagram immediately implies the state with i = 0, j = 3
in the ﬁrst diagram without any ambiguity.
We use the ﬁrst state transition diagram hereafter. The balance equations are

P0,3 × 1 = P0,2 × 1.25 ⇒ P0,2 = 0.8P0,3
P0,2 × 1 = P0,1 × 1.25 ⇒ P0,1 = 0.8P0,2 = (0.8)2P0,3
P0,1 × 1 = P0,0 × 1.25 ⇒ P0,0 = 0.8P0,1 = (0.8)3P0,3
...

Pi−1,0 × 1 = Pi,0 × 1.25 ⇒ Pi,0 = 0.8Pi−1,0 = (0.8)i+3P0,3
Since (cid:1)i,j Pi,j = 1, we have
P0,3 + P0,2 + P0,1 +

Pi,0 = P0,3

(0.8)i = P0,3 (cid:3) 1
1 − 0.8 (cid:4) = 1 ⇒ P0,3 = 0.2
(cid:2)i=0

Therefore,

P0,3 = 0.2, P0,2 = (0.8)(0.2), P0,1 = (0.8)2 (0.2), Pi,0 = (0.8)i+3 (0.2) for i = 0, 1, 2, . . .

Problem 4 (Odoni, 2001)

It gives ρ = 1 (the other root, − 4

customers is λ(cid:3) = λ(1 − P2 ). Since 40,000 customers received service during 10,000 hours,

λ(1 − P2 ) =

Problem 5 (Ingolfsson, 1993)
The state transition diagram for any Markovian (i.e., memoryless) queueing system looks like
the ﬁgure below. The only diﬀerence between such a queueing system and an M/M/1 queueing
system is that in a general Markovian queueing system, the arrival and service rates are allowed to
depend on the state of the system.

The balance equations of this queueing system are

for n = 1, 2, . . .

⇒ Pn =

P0

for n = 1, 2, . . .

(1)

The equation (cid:1)∞
n=0 Pn = 1 can then be used to determine P0 .
(a) Using the general formula (1) with λn = λ
n+1 and µn = µ, we have

Pn =

(cid:2)n=0
⇒ Pn =

e−λ/µ

for n = 0, 1, 2, . . .

So in steady state, the number of customers in this queueing system follows a Poisson PMF
with the mean λ/µ. The fraction of time the server is busy, ρ, is equal to 1 − P0 = 1 − e−λ/µ .
The system reaches steady state as long as

ρ < 1 ⇔ 1 − e−λ/µ < 1 ⇔ e−λ/µ > 0 ⇔ λ/µ < ∞

So all we need to require is that λ < ∞ and µ > 0.

(b) Now we have λn = λ and µn = cnµ, so

Pn =

(λ/µ)n
cn cn−1 · · · c1

P0

for n = 1, 2, . . .

Comparing this with (2), we see that if cn = n, they become identical. When µn = nµ and
λn = λ, the queueing system is equivalent to an M/M/∞ queueing system.

(c) Since the PMF for the steady state number of customers in the system is a Poisson with the
mean λ/µ, we have ¯L = λ/µ. By Little’s law, we have ¯L = ¯λ ¯W , being careful to remember

The reason this approach is wrong is that the probability that a randomly chosen customer
arrives when there are n customers present in the system, say Qn , is not equal to the steady
state probability Pn . In fact,

( ¯L + 1) =

Problem 6

(a) The state, k , can be thought of as the number of service phases. It is not equal to the number
of customers in the system. The system is busy when in states 1 or 2. Hence,

server utilization factor =

P1 + P2
P0 + P1 + P2

5

Figure 5: Service Phases to be Completed

The steady state equations are:

P0 · λ = P1 · µ

P1 · µ = P2 · µ

P0 · λ = P2 · µ

P0 + P1 + P2 = 1

This implies that the service utiilization factor

ρ =

µ · P0 + λ
λ
µ · P0
P0 + λ
µ · P0 + λ
µ · P0

(b) Again, k is the number of service phases to be completed., as shown in Figure 5

(d) The fraction of customers who experience the Erlang order 2 service time is the fraction of
customers who arrive to an empty system. Because PASTA, this fraction is equal to P0 .

(e) The average waiting time for a customer is simply the weighted average of waiting time of
customers who arrive when the system is in state 0 and those who arrive when the system is
in other states.
