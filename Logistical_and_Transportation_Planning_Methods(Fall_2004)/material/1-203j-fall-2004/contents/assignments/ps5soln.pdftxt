Problem  1 

(a)  One  is  tempted  to  say  yes  by  setting  ρ =  N µ  =  2  =  1 . But  λ = 2  is  not  the  rate  at  which

customers  are  accepted  into  the  system  because  we  have  a  loss  system.  Thus  the  answer  is 

no,  and  we  must  derive  the  correct  ﬁgure.  We  can  use  the  following  aggregate  birth-death 

process  (state  transition  diagram  for  an  M/M/2  queueing  system  with  no  waiting  space)  to 

compute  the  workloads:

Since  the  travel  speed  is  constant,  let  us  ﬁrst  compute  the mean  travel  distance  to  a  random

customer,  D . 

¯ D = f11  D1 (sector  1) + f22  D2 (sector  2) + f12  D1 (sector  2) + f21  D2 (sector  1) .

Hence  the  mean  travel  time  to  a  random  served  customer  is  T¯ =

means  that  changes  in  total  service  time  due  to  changes  in  travel  time  are  insigniﬁcant  and

therefore  the Markov  models  applies.  Note  that  another  way  to  compute D  is

In  fact,  we  can  obtain  this  form  by  simplifying  the  formula  for  D  above.  However,  think 

about  how  we  can  obtain  this  directly  without  using  the  formula  for

above.

In  the  steady  state,  the  average  total  number  of customers

).  Server  1  is  sent  to  sector  2  in  the  following  cases: 

(1)  A  customer  arrives  from  sector  2,  server  2  is  busy,  and  server  1  is  idle. 

(2)  A  customer  arrives  from  buﬀer  zone  2,  server  2  is  idle  outside  buﬀer  zone  2,  and  server 

1  is  idle  inside  buﬀer  zone  1. 

The average number of customers  served by  the ﬁrst  case  is λ2T P10 .  To  compute  the average 

number of customers served by the second case,  let us ﬁrst ﬁnd the probability that server 2 is 

idle outside   buﬀer zone 2 and server 1 is idle inside   buﬀer zone 1.  Using geometrical probability 

4 )( 1
and the independence of the two servers, we know that the probability is ( 3
4 )P00 .  Since the 

arrival  rate  from  buﬀer  zone  2  is  λ
2 
4 

,  the  average  number  of customers  served  by  the  second 

case  during  time  interval  T  is  λ T ( 3

Using  these  quantities,  we  obtain  the  fraction  of  dispatch  assignments  that  send  server  1  to 

sector  2  under  the  new  dispatch  policy  as  follows:

12  is  greater  than  f12  = 0.125  as  expected.  Note  that  the  state  transition  diagram  does  not 
f 

change  under  the  new  dispatch  policy  (Why?  Invoke  symmetries). 

(e)  Let T1  be the travel time of server 1 to a random customer and T2  be the travel time of server 

2  to  a  random  customer.  Similar  to  (c),  the  mean  travel  time  to  a  random  customer  under 

the  new  dispatch  policy  is  given  by 

[T1  | server  1  has  been  dispatched  into  sector  1]+

But  the  existence  of buﬀer  zones  complicates  matters.  One  way  to  handle  this  is  as  follows: 

•  Break  up  f

(cid:2)

21 )  into  its  two  constituent  parts  and  compute  a  conditional  mean 
12  (and  f

(cid:2)  and  f 
(cid:2) 
22 . 
11 
•  Combine  the  results  for  the  ﬁnal  answer. 

The  numerical  value  is  less  than  that  of part  (c),  because  we  tend  to  dispatch  the  closer 

available  server  (not  always  successful,  though). 

Although it is not required in the question,  let us compute T ¯(cid:2)  exactly.  We deﬁne the following 

events: 

•  CB:  A  customer  is  in  a  buﬀer  zone.

•  SAB:  Server  of the  adjacent  sector  is  in  its  buﬀer  zone. 
•  SHB:  Server  of home  sector  is  in  its  buﬀer  zone. 

Let us denote by CBc  the  complement  event  of CB,  which  means  that  a  customer  is  not 

in  a  buﬀer  zone.  Other  complement  events  are  deﬁned  similarly.  Then  in  the  state  where 

both  servers  are  available,  with  probability  P00 ,  we  have  eight  mutually  exclusive,  collective 
exhaustive events:  (CB ∩ SAB ∩ SHB),  (CBc ∩ SAB ∩ SHB),  (CB ∩ SABc ∩ SHB),  (CB ∩ SAB ∩ 
SHBc ),  (CBc ∩ SABc ∩ SHB),  (CBc ∩ SAB ∩ SHBc ),  (CB ∩ SABc ∩ SHBc ),  and  (CBc ∩ SABc ∩ 

SHBc ). 
Let  us  abbreviate  these  events  in  binary,  for  example,  (CB ∩ SAB ∩ SHB)  =  (111),  (CBc  ∩ 
SAB ∩ SHBc ) =  (010),  etc.  Then  we  can  write,  using  the  techniques  from  Chapter  3  for  the 

conditional  mean  travel  distances,

= 0.82747 < D =  = 0.83333.  The  mean  travel 
6 

= 2.9789  sec < T¯ = 3  sec.  So, we do  get  an  expected 

improvement  in  mean  response  distance  (time),  but  not  a  large  one.  The  fact  that  we  have 

more  inter-sector  dispatches  does   not   necessarily  mean  that  mean  response  distance  (time) 

will  increase. 

(f )  First, do not use Carter, Chaiken,  and  Ignall  formula  (Equation  (5.18)).  It only applies when 

server  locations  are  ﬁxed.  The  best  option  is  to  compute  T¯(x),  where  x is  the  location  of 

a  boundary  line,  and  use  calculus  to  ﬁnd  an  optimal  value  of  x (as  we  did  in  the  2-server 

numerical example in the book and in class).  The problem with Equation (5.18) is that T1 (B ) 

and  T2 (B )  depend  on  the  location  of the  boundary  line  separating  sectors  1  and  2.  This  is 

because  each  available  server  patrols  uniformly  its  sector  while  it  is  idle  and  thus  its  travel 

time  in  B depends  on  sector  design.

(a)(i)  Figure 1 gives the  layout of the sectors.  The SCM strategy determines which unit should 

be  dispatched  by  assuming  that  the  incident  and  units  are  located  at  the  centers  of mass  of their 

respective  sectors.  That  is,  the  dispatching  strategy  assumes  that  the  incident  occurs  at  ﬁxed 
and  that  unit  i  is  located  at  i+1   for  i  even  and  at  − i  for  i  odd.  Under  SCM,  it  is

obvious  that  the  dispatch  strategy  will  operate  according  to  the  following  ﬁxed  list  of  preferences: 

0,  1  or  2,  3  or  4,  etc.  That  is,  dispatch  unit  0  if it  is  available.  Otherwise,  if one  of units  1  or  2 

is  available,  dispatch  it  (or  either  one  if both  are  available).  Otherwise,  if one  of units  3  or  4  is 

available,  dispatch  one  of them.  Etc. 
For  i  = 0,  let  Si  denote  the  event  that  unit  0  is  available.  For  i  ≥  1,  let  Si  denote  the  event 
that units 0, . . . , 2(i − 1) are unavailable, but at  least one of units 2i or 2i − 1  is available.  We know 

that 

P (S0 ) = 1 − ρ 
P (S1 ) =  ρ(1 − ρ2 ) 
P (S2 ) =  ρ3 (1 − ρ2 ) 
P (S3 ) =  ρ5 (1 − ρ2 )

P (Si ) =  ρ2i−1 (1 − ρ2 ), i ≥ 1 

We want to compute the expected actual distance traveled using the SCM dispatching policy.  Note 

that we  treat  the  incidents  and  units  as  having  deterministic  locations  only  in  setting  the  dispatch 

preferences (and computing the resulting probabilities that particular units are dispatched) and not 

in computing the expected distance given a particular dispatch choice.  Using the Total Expectation

(a)(ii)  Under the MCM strategy, the dispatcher uses the incident’s exact location in determining 

which  unit  to  dispatch.  In  particular,  the  dispatcher  takes  as  an  input  the  ﬁxed  (nonrandom) 
x ∈ [0, 1] giving  the  incident’s  location and chooses unit  i among  the available units  that minimizes 
E [|Xi  − x|]  for  this  value  of  x.  The  expectation  is  taken  over  the  location  of the  unit  i,  given  by 

Xi .

i  ∈ {0, 1, . . . }.  So,  we  dispatch  unit  0  if available.  Otherwise,  we  dispatch  unit  1  if available.  If  
not,  we  try  unit  2,  etc.  Let  S0  denote  the  event  that  unit  0  is  available.  For  i  ≥ 1,  let  Si  denote 
the  event  that  unit  i  is  available  but  units  0, . . . , i − 1  are  unavailable.  P (Si ) = ρi (1 − ρ).  (The  Si 

events  deﬁned  here  are  diﬀerent  from  those  in  part  (i),  with  the  exception  of  S0 ).  Under  case  Si , 

unit  i  is  dispatched. 

In  each  of the  mutually  exclusive  cases  S0 , S1 , S2 , . . . ,  we  must  determine  the  expected  travel 

distance  between  the  dispatched  unit  and  the  incident.  For  this  purpose,  we  treat  X ,  the  location

of the  incident,  as  a  RV.  Since  we  restricted  (without  loss  of generality)  X  to  lie  in  0, 2  , we can

We  can  simplify  the  two  summations  by  noting  that  the  ﬁrst  is  equivalent  to  the  expected  value  of 
a geometric RV with probability of success  in any given  trial 1 − ρ,  and  that  the  second  summation 

is  the  sum  of  all  disjoint  outcomes  for  this  geometric  RV.  Therefore

(a)(iii)  In  the  MCM  strategy,  the  dispatcher  used  only  the  exact  location  of the  incident. 

Under  the  “Closest  Car”  dispatch  strategy,  the  dispatcher  knows  and  uses  the  exact  locations  of 

the  incident  and  all  available  units.  As  the  name  suggests,  under  this  strategy,  the  available  unit 

closest  to  the  incident  is  dispatched.  As  in  part  (ii),  we  can  assume  without  loss  of generality  that 
(cid:10) 
(cid:9)

x ∈ 
0,

2

(otherwise,  simply  renumber  the  intervals  so  this  property  holds). 

To  give  some  motivation  for  the  relevant  events  on  which  we  need  to  condition,  consider  the

(cid:9) 
(cid:10) 
following.  Under the restriction that the incident occurs in  0, 1 
2 , if both units 0 and 1 are available, 


then  one  of the  two  will  be  the  closest  available  unit  to  the  incident.  If unit  0  is  available  and  1 

is  not,  then  unit  0  is  obviously  dispatched,  since,  even  if unit  2  is  available,  unit  0  is  always  closer 

to  the  incident  than  unit  2.  Consider  the  case  where  unit  0  is  unavailable  but  units  1  and  2  are 

available.  The  closest  unit  will  obviously  be  either  1  or  2.  However,  one  can  imagine  values  of 
(cid:10) 
(cid:9)

x ∈  0,

for which  unit  1  is  closest  and  other  values  for which  unit  2  is  closest.  We  are  now  ready 

to  deﬁne  the  general  set  of events  on  which  we  want  to  condition.

When  considering  i  ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . },  these  events  are  mutually  exclusive  and  exhaust  the  sample 

1 ,  unit  i  will  always  be  the  closest  unit  and  therefore  the

It  is much more diﬃcult  to compute E [D  | Si 
2 ].  To do  so, we will use  the “never  fail” method of 
2  .  In  particular,  we  only  need  to  compute  the  CDFs  of  D  given

We  wish  to  compute 

P (D > d | S0 , X = x) =  P (x − X1  > d, |X0  − x| > d) 
2
=  P (x − X1  > d)P (|X0  − x| > d),  by  independence  of X0 , X1 

The  ﬁrst  factor  gives  the  probability  that  unit  1  is  more  than  d  units  away  from  the  incident 

located  at  x.  The  second  factor  gives  the  probability  that  unit  0  is  more  than  d  units  away  from 

the  incident.  Since  we  are  working  with  uniform  distributions,  these  probabilities  can  be  found  by 
considering the percentage of sectors 1 and 0,  respectively, not covered by the  interval  [x − d, x + d]. 

Since  the  sectors  have  length  1,  these  percentages  are  simply  given  by  the  total  length  within  the 
sector  not  covered  by  [x − d, x + d]. 
(cid:10) 
(cid:9) 
From  Figure  1,  it  is  clear  we  must  analyze  this  probability  in  several  cases.  First,  if  d ∈  0, 2  , 
1
there  are  some  values  of  x for  which  X1  is  never  within  d units  of  x (namely  when  d − x < 0.  For 

such  values  of  x  and  d,  X0  can  be  more  than  d  units  away  from  x  by  being  either  to  the  left  of 
(cid:10) 
(cid:5) 
x − d or  to  the  right  of x + d.  See Figure  2  for  illustration.  For d ∈  2 , 1  ,  the  situation  is diﬀerent. 
1 

X1  is  not  always more  than  d units  away  from  x.  Furthermore, X0  can be more than  d units  away 

from  x  only  by  being  to  the  right  of  x + d. If  x + d >  1,  X0  is  always  within  d  units  of  x. See 

Figure  3  for  illustration.

It  is  clear  that  P (D >  d  |  S1 ) = 1  for  d  ≤  0 and  P (D >  d  |  S1 ) = 0  for  d  ≥  3  .  Again,  we  will

The  ﬁrst  factor  gives  the  probability  that  unit  1  is more  than  d units  away  from  the  incident.  The 

second  factor  gives  the  analogous  probability  for  unit  2.  As  before,  we  must  break  our  analysis

of  ρ.  This  result  makes  intuitive  sense.  For  ρ  near  0,  unit  0  (the  unit  in  the  same  sector  as  the 

incident)  is  usually  dispatched,  regardless  of the  dispatch  strategy.  However,  under  the  “closest 

car”  dispatch  strategy,  it  is  sometimes  advantageous  to  dispatch  unit  1  or  2  over  unit  0  (hence  the 
savings  of  24  ).  For  ρ → 1,  ij (ρ) = 0,  ∀i, j .  In  this  second  limiting  case,  we  expect  very  few  of  the 
1

units  to  be  available  at  the  same  time.  Accordingly,  we  won’t  have  the  opportunity  to  be  picky

about  which  car  to  dispatch,  since  “beggars  can’t  be  choosers.”  As  a  result,  the  dispatch  strategy 

should  not  make  a  diﬀerence  in  expected  travel  distance. 

For intermediate values of ρ, as ρ increases, the probability of out-of-sector dispatching increases. 

For  such  intermediate  values,  the  “closest  car”  dispatch  strategy  performs  best,  followed  by MCM, 

and  then  SCM.  That  12  and  13  have  single  maxima  is  explained  by  the  fact  that,  as  ρ  increases, 

at  ﬁrst,  the  more  precise  dispatch  strategy  works  better.  Once  ρ  becomes  too  large,  we  reach  a 

situation  in  which  this  added  level  of pickiness  does  not  make  a  diﬀerence  since  very  few  cars  are 

available.  Lastly,  as  we  would  expect,  the  “closest  car”  strategy  is  most  powerful  when  we  have  a 

lot  of choice  –  i.e.  when  ρ  is  low  and  therefore  many  of  the  units  are  simultaneously  available. 

Problem  3 

(a)   Let  us  denote  the  state  of the  system  by  a  3-character  list  of the  status  of each  server  (0 

indicates free and 1 indicates busy), where the status of server 1 is given by the right-most character 

and  that  of server  3  is  given  by  the  left-most  character.  Let  Pn  denote  the  probability  that  a  total

travel  time  by  assuming  that  the  call  originates  from  district  1.  We will  use  the Total  Expectation 

Theorem  by  conditioning  on  the  following  mutually  exclusive  and  exhaustive  events 

•  A:  unit  1  is  available  when  the  call  arrives.  P (A) = 1 − ρ1  =  3 . 
1

•  B :  unit  1  is  unavailable  when  the  call  arrives  but  at  least  one  of units  2  or  3  is  available. 

2
P (B ) = P001  + P101  + P011  =  9 

•  C :  no  unit  is  available  when  the  call  arrives.  P (C ) = 1 − P0  − P1  − P2  = .9
4

Recall that if unit 1 is unavailable but units 2 and 3 are available, then one of 2 or 3 is dispatched 

to  the  call.  In  either  case,  the  expected  travel  time  is  2  minutes.  Now  consider  case  C .  Due  to 

the memorylessness  of the  exponential  distribution  and  the  fact  that  the  service  time  distributions 

are  the  same  for  each  unit,  the  call  is  equally  likely  to  be  served  by  any  of  the  three  units.  So,  the

expected  value  of a  sum  of random  variables  is  always  the  sum  of the  expected  values,  regardless 

of whether  the  random  variables  are  independent  or  not  (linearity  of expectation).  Since  the 

integration  inside  the  expectation  is  essentially  the  same  as  summation  (we’re  just  summing  over 

tiny  intervals),  we  have  that

where  the  last  equality  follows  from  the  fact  that  the  expected  value  of  an  indicator  function  is 

equal  to  the  probability  that  the  indicator  equals  1.  Now,  it  is  easy  to  see  that  P (x  covered)  may 
not  be  the  same  for  all  values  of  x  ∈  [0, 6).  for  instance,  if  x  equals  the  home  location  of one  of  

the  units,  then  the  probability  of coverage  is  likely  to  be  higher.  However,  for  certain  intervals,  it 

turns  out  that  P (x  covered)  is  constant.  In  particular,  we  can  break  our  analysis  into  two  cases. 
First, let us derive γij , the fractions of i dispatches whose destination is district j , i, j  ∈ {1, 2, 3}. 

Note  that  the  γij  are  not  the  same  as  the  fij  deﬁned  in  the  text,  since  the  latter  is  given  to  be  the 

fraction  of  al l   dispatches  (not  just  i  dispatches),  which  take  unit  i  to  district  j .  We will  derive  the 

γij  from  the  fij  via  renormalization.  Recall  that  each  fij  is  the  sum  of a  term  corresponding  to 

the  fraction  of  dispatches  of  i  to  j  that  incur  no  queueing  delay  and  those  that  do  incur  a  delay 

in  queue.  For  any  call  delayed  in  queue  (arrives  when  all  of the  units  are  busy),  because  of the 

memorylessness of the  exponential distribution,  the  call  is  equally  likely  to be answered by any one

So,  to  derive  the  γij ,  we must  renormalize  so  that  the  sample  space  includes  only  dispatches  of 

unit  i.  Again,  we  can  exploit  the  symmetry  of the  problem  to  conclude  that

Now,  we  are  ready  to  derive  P (x  covered).  By  the  symmetry  of the  problem,  we  derive  this 

result  by  assuming,  without  loss  of generality,  that  x  is  located  within  district  1.  Now,  we  need  to 

consider  the  following  two  cases.  Let  Ei  denote  the  event  that  x  is  covered  by  unit  i. 

•  Case   1:   x  is  within  1  mile  of the  home  location  of unit  1.

To  explain  the  entries  in  the  following  table,  note  that  a  unit  located within  district  1  covers

x  if it  is  in  the  1 
2  mile  to  the  right  or  to  the  left  of  x.  Thus,  the  unit  must  be  in  one  of two 

subintervals whose  lengths  add  to  1 mile.  Given  that  a  unit  is  in  district  1,  its  exact  location 

within  the  district  is  uniformly  distributed.  Therefore,  given  that  a  unit  is  in  district  1,  the 

1
probability  that  it  covers  x  is  simply  2  (since  district  1  has  total  length  2  miles).  Let  Q

Now,  we  are  ready  to  compute  the  average  length  of the  city  that  is  covered  at  a  random  time. 

Note  that  there  are  3  miles  of the  city  that  ﬁt  Case  1,  namely  the  three  1-mile  strips  centered  at
