Due: Wednesday September 22nd in Class 

Problem 1: Urban OR Text  2.3 

Problem 2: Urban OR  3.1 

Problem 3: 

        Suppose that, in the pedestrian crossing problem, the line  
turns green when the second pedestrian to arrive after the last green  
has waited Q minutes.   Please answer the five stated questions  
(starting with the mean number of left-bound pedestrians per green)  
under this policy. 

The Five Questions Are (taken from lecture): 
(a)  Find the expected number of left to right pedestrians per green. 
(b)  Find the probability of zero left to right pedestrians for a given green. 
(c)  Find the probability density function for the time between greens. 
(d)  Find the average waiting time for a random arriving passenger. 
(e)  Find the average waiting time for an observer.
