Due:  Monday, October 4, 2004 In Class 

(1) Suppose that z is the maximum of seven independent variables that  
are all uniform on (0,a).   Use Crofton's method to determine  
E(z-squared) in terms of a. 

(2)  Problem 3.18 

(3) Consider a square area of side 4, with (0,0) the lower left 
corner.  A barrier extends from (0,1) to (4,1), with a break at  
(1,1) through which traffic can pass.     Assume that an emergency is  
equally likely to arise at all points in the square, while the  
position of the response vehicle is uniformly distributed over the  
square and independent of the location of the emergency. 

(i) Compared to having no barrier, what is the maximum additional  
travel distance (Manhattan metric) that the barrier could impose on  
the response vehicle? 

(ii)What is the probability that the additional travel distance  
because of the barrier is greater than 5? 

(iii)What is the mean additional travel distance for the response 
vehicle caused by the barrier? 

(4)  Problem 

3.13 

(5) In the sky-crossing example, what is the probability that an  
eastbound plane will be in conflict with exactly three northbound  
planes? 

Given such a triple conflict, what is the probability that all three  
northbound planes are in conflict with one another?  (HINT:  Under 
the Poisson assumption, the locations of the three planes are  
independent and uniform over (-7.1, 7.1) when the eastbound plane 
passes through J.
