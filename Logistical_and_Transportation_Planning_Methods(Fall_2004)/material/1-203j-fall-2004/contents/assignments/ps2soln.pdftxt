Let  G(a) =  E [Z 2 ],  where  Z  =  max (X1 , . . . , X7 ),  Xi  ∼  U(0, a)  i.i.d.  i  ∈ {1, . . . , 7}. Let  us 
calculate  G(a + )  for  the  following  cases. 

Case 
Xi  ∈ [0, a],  ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , 7} 
Exactly  1  of  the Xi  ∈ (a, a + ] 
The  other  6  in  [0, a] 

More  than  1  of  the Xi  ∈ (a, a + ]

as    approaches  zero.  Let  us  examine  the  probabilities  shown  in  this  table.  Since  the  Xi  are  i.i.d. 
U (0, a+ ), the event that Xi  ∈ [a, a+ ] can be viewed as a Bernoulli trial with probability of success

The  reason why we  can  say  “who  cares”  for  the  cases when more  than  1  of  the Xi  falls  in  [a, a + ] 
is  that  G(a + )  ≤  (a + )2  .  And,  o() (a + )2  =  o().  So,  by  conditioning  on  each  of  the  given

Integrating  both  sides  yields  a7G(a) =  9 a9  + K ,  where  K  is  the  constant  of  integration.  It  is 
obvious  that  G(0)  =  0,  since  Z  =  0,  whenever  Xi  = U(0, 0),  i  ∈ {1, . . . , 7}  i.i.d.  We  can  use  this 
boundary  condition  to  solve  for K . Namely,  0 = 0 + K .  Therefore K  = 0.  So,  ﬁnally

For  this problem, we  employ  the notation used  in  class, which  is  a  little diﬀerent  from  the notation 
in  the  textbook. 
Let  G(a) ≡ E [Dp ] ≡ E [|X1  − X2 |p ].  Let  us  consider  G(a + ε)  that  is  E [Dp ]  when  the  highway 
segment  under  consideration  is  extended  by  ε  where  ε  is  very  small.  Suppose  a < X1  ≤ a + ε  and 

2


0 ≤ X2  ≤ a. Since  X1  and X2  are  independent,  G(a + ε)  for  this  case  is  computed  as  follows:

where fX1 (x1 ) and fX2 (x2 ) are the probability density functions of X1  and X2 , respectively.  Because 
X1  and X2  are uniformly distributed over (a, a+ε] and [0, a] respectively, fX1 (x1 ) =  1  and fX2 (x2 ) =

When 0 ≤ X1  ≤ a and a < X2  ≤ a + ε, we also have G(a + ε) ≈  (p+1)  as  ε → 0 by  symmetry.  If 
ap
0 ≤ X1  ≤ a and 0 ≤ X2  ≤ a, then G(a + ε) = G(a).  Finally, we do not have to compute G(a + ε) for 
the  case where  a < X1  ≤ a + ε  and  a < X2  ≤ a + ε  because  the  associated  probability  is  negligible. 
The  following  table  summarizes  G(a + ε)’s.

textbook.  Once  we  obtain  G(a + ε),  we  can  plug  it  in  (3.64),  which  gives  the  same  diﬀerential 
equation  as  above. 

3   (Aghassi   2002)  
The  situation  is  illustrated  in  Figure  1.  To  solve  the  problem,  let  us  divide  the  region  into  four 
subregions  by  adding  a  dashed  vertical  line  (not  representing  a  barrier)  at  x = 1. 

(i)  First,  let  us  note  that  the  barrier  does  not  cause  extra  y  travel  distance.  It  can,  however, 
cause  extra  x  travel  distance.  For  example,  extra  x  travel  distance  will  be  required  for  travel 
between  points  in  regions  A  and  D  and  between  points  in  regions  B  and  C .  The  maximum  extra 
x  travel  distance  will  be  incurred  when,  without  the  barrier,  the  x  travel  distance  would  be  0,  but 
with the barrier, the x travel distance is two times the length of the  longer side of the barrier.  Since 
the  longer  side  of  the  barrier  has  length  three,  the  maximum  possible  extra  travel  distance  will  be 
6.  This  situation  arises  whenever  the  emergency  and  response  vehicle  both  have  x-coordinate  4, 
but  one  is  in  region  B ,  while  the  other  is  in  region  C . 

(ii)  Let  De  denote  the  additional  travel  distance  due  to  the  barrier.  By  reasoning  similar  to 
that  used  in  part  (i),  note  that  if  the  emergency  is  in  region  A  and  the  response  unit  is  in  region 

5


D ,  or  vice  versa,  the  maximum  possible  extra  travel  distance  will  be  2.  So,  in  order  for  De  >  5, 
we must  have  the  emergency  in  region B  and  the  response  unit  in  region C ,  or  vice  versa.  Let BC 
denotes  the  event  that  one  of  the  emergency  and  the  response  unit  is  in  region  B  and  the  other  is 
in  region  C .  Then, 
P (De  > 5)  =  P (De  > 5  | BC )P (BC ) 
P (BC ) =  P (emergency  in  B, unit  in  C) + P (emergency  in  C, unit  in  B) 

= 2P (emergency  in  B, unit  in  C) 

since  the  locations  of  emergency  and  unit  are  identically  distrib

since  the  locations  of  emergency  and  unit  are  indep

Let  Xu  and  Xi  denote  the  x-coordinates  of  the  response  unit  and  emergency,  respectively.  Given 
event BC ,  the  x  travel  distance without  the  barrier  is  | Xu − Xi  |.  With  the  barrier,  it  is Xu − 1 + 
Xi  − 1.  So,  the  extra  travel  distance  is 
(Xu  − 1) + (Xi  − 1)− | Xu  − Xi  |  = (Xu  − 1) + (Xi  − 1)− |(X u  − 1) − (Xi  − 1) | 
= 2 min(Xu  − 1, Xi  − 1) 
Accordingly,  given  event  BC ,  De  > 5  whenever  2 min(Xu  − 1, Xi  − 1) > 5  ⇐⇒  Xu , Xi  > 3.5. 
(cid:8) 
(cid:9)2 
P (Xu  > 3.5, Xi  > 3.5 | BC ) =  P (Xu  > 3.5  | BC )P (Xi  > 3.5 | BC ),  since  Xu ,  Xi  indep

=

The  last equality  follows  since Xu  and Xi  are  identically distributed,  and  since,  given BC ,  they are 
(cid:9)

both  U(1, 4).  Therefore,

♣ ASIDE:  It   is   tempting,   but   incorrect,   to   argue   that   De  >  5  whenever   Xu  − 1 + Xi  − 1 >  5. 
That   is,   whenever   Xu  + Xi  > 7.   In   fact,   nearly   half   the   class   made   this   mistake.   Xu  − 1 + Xi  − 1 
gives   the   total   x-distance   traveled   with   the   barrier,   which   is   not   always   equal   to   the   extra   x-distance  
traveled.   To   see   why,   consider   (Xu , Xi ) = (3.1, 4),   which   satisﬁes   Xu +Xi  > 7.   Without   the   barrier,  
the   x-distance   would   be   0.9.   With   the   barrier,   the   x-distance   is   (3.1 − 1) + (4 − 1) =  5.1. So,  the  
extra   travel   distance   is   only   4.2.   So,   while   this   condition   captures   some   cases   when   De  > 5, it also  
captures   several   cases   where   De  < 5.

(iii)  We already noted that there is no additional travel distance due to the barrier unless either 
of  the  following  two  cases  hold 
•  one  of  the  response  unit  and  emergency  is  in  region  A  and  the  other  is  in  region D . Let  AD 
denote  this  event.  By  reasoning  similar  to  that  used  in  part  (ii),  we  have  that  P (AD) = 
2P (emergency  in  A)P (unit  in  D) = 2 ·

•  one  of  the  response  unit  and  emergency  is  in  region  B  and  the  other  is  in  region  C . Let  BC 
27
denote  this  event.  We  already  calculated  P (BC ) =  128  . 

Using  conditional  expectations,  we  can  say  that 
E [De ] =  E [De  | BC ]P (BC ) + E [De  | AD ]P (AD) 
+ E [De  | neither  BC  nor  AD]P (neither  BC  nor  AD) 

Let  Xu  and  Yu  denote  the  x- and  y -coordinates,  repsectively,  of  the  response  unit,  and  Xi  and  Yi 
denote  the  x- and  y -coordinates,  respectively,  of  the  emergency. 

Case   1)   Event  BC 

To calculate expected travel distances in the case BC , we can assume without loss of generality 
that  the  response  unit  is  in  region  B  and  the  emergency  is  in  region  C .  The  justiﬁcation  is 
that  the  travel  distance  from  a  point  in  region  B  to  a  point  in  region  C  is  equivalent  to  the 
distance  from  the  same  point  in  region C  to  the  same  point  in  region B .  Given  this  case  and 
these  additional  speciﬁcs, Xu , Xi  ∼ U(1, 4)  i.i.d.,  Yu  ∼ U(1, 4)  and  Yi  ∼ U(0, 1).  Without  the 
barrier,  the  expected  travel  distance  is 
E [| Xu  − Xi  |] + E [Yu  − Yi ] = 
3 + E [Yu ] − E [Yi ]
1 
3 
= 1 + 2.5 − 0.5 = 3 

With  the  barrier,  the  expected  travel  distance  is 
E [Xu  − 1] + E [Xi  − 1] + E [Yu  − Yi ] = (2.5 − 1) + (2.5 − 1) + 2  =  5 
Therefore,  E [De  | BC ] = 5 − 3 = 2. 
Case   2)   Event  AD 

As  in  the  preceding  case,  we  can  assume  without  loss  of  generality  that  the  response  unit  is 
in  region A and  the  emergency  is  in  region D .  Then, Xu , Xi  ∼ U(0, 1)  i.i.d., Yu  ∼ U(1, 4) and 
Yi  ∼ U(0, 1).  Without  the  barrier,  the  expected  travel  distance  is 
+ 2.5 − 0.5 = 2
E [| Xu  − Xi  |] + E [Yu  − Yi ] = 
1

With  the  barrier,  the  expected  travel  distance  is 
E [1 − Xu ] + E [1 − Xi ] + E [Yu  − Yi ] = (1 − 0.5) + (1 − 0.5) + 2  =  3 
Therefore,  E [De  | AD ] = 3 − 2 1  = .

Plugging  back  into  our  equation  for  E [De ],  and  noting  that  E [De  |  neither  BC  nor  AD ] = 0,  we

(i)  What is the probability that an eastbound plane will be in conﬂict with exactly 3 northbound 
planes? 
In  class, we  showed  that  an  eastbound  plane  is  at  any  time  in  conﬂict with  a  northbound  plane 
if the following condition holds.  At the time the eastbound plane is at the junction, the northbound 
√ 
plane  is  within  5  2  of  it.  So,  an  eastbound  plane  will  have  been  in  conﬂict  at  some  point  with 
each  of  exactly  three  diﬀerent  northbound  planes  if,  at  the  time  the  eastbound  plane  is  at  the 
√ 
junction,  there  are  exactly  three  northbound  planes  within  5  2  of  it.  Recall  that,  in  this  model, 
the  arrival  process  of  northbound  planes  to  the  junction  is  taken  to  be  Poisson  with  rate  λN  per 
minute.  Furthermore,  planes  travel  at  600  mph  =  10  miles/min.  So,  when  the  eastbound  plane  is 
√ 
at the  junction,  there will be exactly 3 northbound planes within 5  2 of  it  iﬀ exactly 3 northbound

planes  will  arrive  at  the  junction  in  a  10

P (conﬂict  with  exactly  3  N  planes)  = 

2 minute  time  horizon.  That  is 
√ 
√ 
e−λN  2 (λN  2)3 
3! 

(ii)  Given  such  a  triple  conﬂict, what  is  the  probaiblity  that  all  three  northbound  planes  are  in 
conﬂict  with  one  another? 
From  section  2.12.3  in  the  Larson  and  Odoni  textbook,  we  know  that  the  unordered  arrival 
(cid:1)  √ √  (cid:2) 
times  in  a  Poisson  process  are  independently,  uniformly  distributed  over  the  ﬁxed  time  interval  of 
interest.  So,  in our case, given that there are 3 northbound arrivals in time interval  − 2
2  , 
2
, the 
2 
arrival  times  of  these  three  planes  are  independently  and  uniformly  distributed  over  this  interval. 
Since distance  is  just  speed multiplied by  time, we  can  equivalently  say  that,  given  that  there are 3 
√ √ 
northbound planes  located  spatially  in an  interval  (−5 2, 5  2),  their  locations within  this  interval 
are  independently  and  uniformly  distributed  over  the  interval.  Finally,  to  make  the  calculations 
√ 
easier,  we  can  work  with  the  interval  (0, 10  2),  since  shifting  the  endpoints  in  this  way  will  not 
aﬀect  the  probability  calculation. 
Let  X1 ,  X2 , and  X3  be  the  locations  of  the  planes  in  this  interval.  We  know  that  Xi  ∼ 
√ 
U(0, 10  2)  i  ∈ {1, 2, 3} i.i.d.  All  three  of  these  planes  will  be  in  conﬂict  with  one  another 
if  every  pair  of  planes  chosen  from  the  3  are  within  5  miles  of  each  other.  This  occurs  iﬀ 
max(X1 , X2 , X3 ) − min(X1 , X2 , X3 )  ≤ 5.  For  ease  of  notation,  let  Xmin  denote  min(X1 , X2 , X3 ), 
Xmax  denote  max(X1 , X2 , X3 ) and  Xmid  denote  the  remaining  point. 
There  are  at  least  two  ways  to  solve  the  problem. 
Method  1  Work  with  the  sample  space  directly  to  obtain  relevant  derived  distributions.  √ 
We want P (Xmax  − Xmin  ≤ 5).  We  can  derive  the CDF  of Xmin  as  follows.  For  r ∈ [0, 10  2],
P (Xmin  ≤ r) = 1 − P (min(X1 , X2 , X3 ) > r) 
= 1 − P (X1  > r, X2  > r, X3  > r)

√ 
= 1 −
10  2 
√ 
For  r < 0,  P (Xmin  ≤ r) = 0.  And,  for  r > 10  2,  P (Xmin  ≤ r) = 1.  Then

We must derive P (Xmax  ≤ x | Xmin  = r).  When Xmin  = r ,  the  remaining  two points must be

in  [r, 10  2].  Since  all  Xi ,  i  ∈ {1, 2, 3},  were  uniformly  distributed  over  the  original  interval 
√ 
[0, 10  2],  these  remaining  two  points  will  be  uniformly  distributed  over  this  new  interval 
√ 
[r, 10  2].  Given  that Xmin  = r , Xmax  ≤ x will never happen  if x < r. If x ≥ r ,  it will happen 
whenever  the  two  non-minimum  points  are  in  [r, x].  (cid:1)

Method  2  Use Crofton’s Method, noting that a probability is itself the expected value of a relevant 
indicator  RV. 

Recall that Crofton’s Method was presented in the text and in class as a method for computing 
mean  values  related  to N  points  independently  and uniformly distributed  over  some  interval. 
We  want  to  compute  P (Xmax  − Xmin  ≤ 5).  Let  I  be  an  indicator  RV  s.t. 
(cid:22) 
1, Xmax  − Xmin  ≤ 5 
0,  otherwise 
And  P (Xmax  − Xmin  ≤ 5) = E [I ].  Therefore,  we  can  also  use  Crofton’s  Method  to  compute 
P (Xmax  − Xmin  ≤ 5).  Let  Xi  ∼ U(0, a)  i  ∈ {1, 2, 3} i.i.d.  And  let  Xmin  = min(X1 , X2 , X3 ), 
Xmax  = max(X1 , X2 , X3 ), and Xmid  be the remaining point.  Let G(a) = P (Xmax  −Xmin  ≤ 5).
