(b)  Although  the  service  time  for  each  customer  type  is  constant,  the  queueing  system  is  no 
longer  M/D/1  because  the  service  time  of  Type  1  customers  is  diﬀerent  from  that  of  Type 
2  customers.  We  can  view  this  queueing  system  as  an  M/G/1  queueing  system  where  the 
service  time  distribution  is  given  by  the  following  PMF: 
� 

pS (s) =

2 , s = 1 minute ,

The  total  expected  cost  of  waiting  time  is  given  by

C  = (λ1 c1  + λ2 c2 )Wq  = (λ1 c1  + λ2 c2 ) 

. 

Since  1  + σ2  = E [S ]2  + σ2  = E [S 2 ],  C  can  be  rewritten  as

C  = (λ1 c1  + λ2 c2 )

(c)  In  this  part,  we  have  an  M /D/1  system  (a  special  case  of  the  M /G/1),  where  services  are 
deterministic and last exactly 1 minute, regardless of customer type.  Let “IC” denote internal

In  part  (f ),  E [S ]  is  the  same  as  in  part  (c).  However,  E [S 2 ]  and  therefore  Var(S ) have 
increased  causing  Wq  and  both  internal  costs  to  increase.  In  addition,  in  part  (c),  when 
2 ] = E [S 2 ],  dWq  =  2(1−ρ)2  for both i ∈ {1, 2}.  In contrast,  in part (f ) since E [S 2 ]  (cid:9)

= E [S2

dλi 
the  external  costs  are  diﬀerent.  Both  external  costs  increase  in  part  (f ),  as  compared  with 
part  (c).  For  the  type  2  customers,  it  is  easy  to  see  the  reason;  both  E [S 2 ] and  E [S2
2 ] have 
increased from their values in part (c).  For the type 1 customers, E [S 2 ] has decreased from its 
1
value  in  part  (c),  but  the  dWq  factor  in  the  external  cost  is  dominated  by  the  term  involving 
dλ1

2 ].  So,  the  decrease  in  E [S 2 ]  is  outweighed  by  the  increase  in  E [S 2 ].
E [S 2 ]  rather  than  E [S1
1
Lastly,  the  external  cost  due  to  type  2  customers  is,  as  expected,  higher  than  that  due  to 
type  1,  since  the  former  require  a  longer  service  time. 

(g)  Using  the  lecture  notes  we  get:


f1  = c1  ∗ µ1  = 14400

f2  = c2  ∗ µ2  = 6642


Thus,we  should  assign  type  one  customers  priority.


(h)  We  use  the  formula 

C  = c1  ∗ λ1  ∗ W1  + c2  ∗ λ2  ∗ W2 

Plugging  in  for  the  above  we  get: 
C  = 3600 ∗ 0.013 + 4320 ∗ 0.1312 

C  = $614.25 

What we learned is that the cost in the priority system is greater than that of the non-priority 
system,  thus  giving  vustomers  priority  is more  expensive. 

2  To obtain  the  result, we have here a  special  case of  (4.101), where k = 2,  ¯ Lqi  = 0 (i = 1, 2),  and 
1  =  1  .  Therefore,

a=number  of  planes  in  ﬁrst  stage  of  service 

b=number  of  planes  in  second  stage  of  service 

c=number  of  planes  in  queue 

From  that  we  get  the  transition  diagram  given  in  the  handout. 

Where  we  note  that  we  can  split  a  passion  process.  i.e.,  if  repairs  are  completed  at  rate  µ 
and  the  probability  another  stage  of  repair  is  needed  occurs  with  .6  then  the  transition  rate 
from  the  ﬁrst  to  the  second  repair  stage  is  µ ∗ .6. 

(b)  We  need  to  compute  the  steady  state  probabilities.	 These  can  be  found  by  solving  the 
following  set  of  equations: 

2P (1, 0, 1) + 0.8P (1, 1, 0) = P (0, 0, 0) 

P (0, 0, 0) + 0 .8p(2, 1, 0) + 2P (2, 0, 1) = 1.2p(1, 1, 0) + 0 .6666p(1, 1, 0) + .8p(1, 1, 0)


.66666P (1, 1, 0) + .8P (3, 1, 0) + 2P (3, 0, 1) = 1.2P (2, 1, 0) + .333333P (2, 1, 0)


.33333P (2, 1, 0) =  .8P (3, 1, 0) + 1.2P (3, 1, 0)


1.2P (1, 1, 0) = 2P (1, 0, 1) + .66666P (1, 0, 1)


.6666P (1, 0, 1) + 1.2P (2, 1, 0) = 2P (2, 0, 1) + .33333P (2, 0, 1)


.33333P (2, 0, 1) + 1.2P (3, 1, 0) = 2P (3, 0, 1)


P (0, 0, 0) + P (1, 1, 0) + P (2, 1, 0) + P (3, 1, 0) + P (1, 0, 1) + P (2, 0, 1) + P (3, 0, 1) = 1


Solving  these  we  get:


P (0, 0, 0) = .4224 


P (1, 1, 0) = .2485 


P (2, 1, 0) = .0964 


P (3, 1, 0) = .0161 


P (1, 0, 1) = .1118 


P (2, 0, 1) = .0815 


P (3, 0, 1) = .0232 


5 

Thus  the  expected  value  for  the  number  in  the  system  is: 

(.2485 + .1118) + 2(.0964 + .0815) + 3(.0161 + .0232) = 0.834 

4  The  airport  can  be  modeled  as  an M/G/1  queueing  system  with  a  uniform  service  time  distri-
bution  with  E [S ] = 60 sec  and  σ2  = 48  sec2  .
S 

(a)  The  yearly  cost  to  the  commercial  airlines  due  to  peak-hour  delays  is  computed  by 
CA  = cAλAWq  × 1000 , 

where 
•  cA  is  the  average  cost  of  1 minute’s  waiting  for  commercial  jets  =  $12/min/aircraft, 
•  λA  is  the  arrival  rate  of  commercial  jets  =  40 aircraft/hr. 

To  compute  Wq ,  we  use  the  Pollaczek-Khintchine  formula  (4.81)  for  the  M/G/1  queueing 
system.


Wq  = 

λ(1/µ2  + σ2

S )
2(1 − ρ) 

, 

where 
•  λ  =  55  aircraft/hr  =  11  aircraft/min,

•  µ =  E [S ]  =  1  aircraft/min,

•  σ2  = 48  sec2  =  1  min2  ,
S

•  ρ =  λ  = .

Note  that  we  are  using  λ  (not  λA )  in  computing Wq .  Plugging  the  numbers  into  the  formula 
for Wq , we have Wq  = 5.57 ˙3 minutes.  Therefore 
CA  = $12/min/aircraft × 40 aircraft/hr × 5.57 ˙3 minutes × 1000  hours = $2, 675, 200 . 

(b)  Let  f  be  the  amount  of  increase  in  landing  fees.  Then  the  arrival  rate  of  general  aviation  is 
expressed  by  15 −  15  f  per  hour.  Since  the  arrival  rate  of  commercial  airlines  is  not  aﬀected
