Problem Set 6 
(Due: Wednesday, December 1, 2004) 

 
Problem 1: Exercise 6.7 (page 442) in Larson and Odoni. 
 
Problem 2:  Problem 6.6 in L+O. 
 
Problem 3:  Problem 6.11 in L+O. 
 
Problem 4:  Problem 6.17 in L+O. 
 
Problem 5:  
 
Consider the Traveling Salesman Problem with Backhauls (TSPB), a version of the TSP 
which is as follows:  Suppose we have one “station point”, s, a set D of “delivery” points 
(|D| = n) and a set P of “pick-up” points (|P| = m).  Assume the travel medium is the 
Euclidean plane and that all n+m+1 points in the problem are distinct, so that the 
Euclidean distance between any pair of points is positive.  We want to design a tour of 
minimum length that has this description:  a vehicle will begin from s, will visit first all 
the n points in D to deliver packages, will then (without first returning to s) visit all m 
points in P to pick up packages and will finally go back to s (where the tour ends) .   
 
The following heuristic, based on the idea of the Christofides heuristic for the TSP, has 
been proposed recently for the TSPB (we shall leave Step 4 incomplete until the second 
question of our problem):   
 
 
Step 1:  Construct:  (a) TD, the minimum spanning tree of D, i.e., the MST that 
connects all n delivery points; (b) TP, the minimum spanning tree of P, i.e., the MST that 
connects all m pick-up points.   
 
Now, connect s to the delivery point in D which is closest to s.  Also connect s to 
the pick-up point in P which is closest to s.   
 
In this way a single tree, T, is formed which consists of TD, TP, s and the two 
links connecting s to TD and TP, respectively. 
 
Step 2:  Transform the (n+m+1)x(n+m+1) matrix of Euclidean distances between 
 
pairs of points in the problem in the following way:  leave all distances between pairs of 
points in D unchanged, i.e., equal to the Euclidean distances between these points; 
similarly, leave all distances between pairs of points in P unchanged; then add a large 
constant K to all the other distances in the matrix.  This means that if the Euclidean 
distance between any point i ε D and any point j ε P is d(i, j) units, it will be changed to 
d(i, j)+K in the transformed distance matrix; similarly, the distance between s and i in the 
transformed distance matrix will be d(s, i)+K and the distance between s and j will be d(s, 
j)+K.  Note that the same “large constant” K is added in all cases.  K is chosen so that it

Step 4:  Merge H with T to obtain an Eulerian graph G (i.e., G = T∪H).   

is much larger than any of the Euclidean distances (or sums of Euclidean distances) 
encountered in the problem.  
 
Step 3:  Let R be the set of odd-degree nodes in T, the tree obtained in Step 1.  
 
Find the minimum-cost pairwise matching between the nodes (points) in R, using the 
transformed distance matrix prepared in Step 2.  Let H be the (disjoint) graph consisting 
of the set of links (straight lines) which correspond to this minimum-cost pairwise 
matching.  (For example, if the points i ε D and j ε  P are both in R and have been 
matched together in the minimum-cost matching, then the link (i, j) will be in H; 
similarly, if the points v ε D and w ε  D are both in R and have been matched together, the 
link (v, w) will be in H; and so on.)  Note that, in drawing the graph H, we forget about 
the large constant K. 
 
 
 
Question 1:  Explain carefully but briefly why it is true that the number of (odd-degree) 
nodes in R which are also delivery points is an odd number (i.e., |R∩D| is an odd 
number).  By analogy it is also true that the number of (odd-degree) nodes in R which are 
also pick-up points is an odd number (i.e., |R∩P| is also an odd number). 
 
Question 2:  Assume (if you have not been able to show it) that the observation in 
Question 1 is correct.  Given this, argue carefully but briefly that: 
 
(a) The graph G constructed in Step 4 of the algorith has an Euler tour, i.e., has no 
nodes of odd degree. 
 
(b) It is possible, using only links in G, to find an Euler tour which is a feasible 
(not necessarily optimal) solution to the TSPB.  In other words, it is possible to find on G 
an Euler tour that begins at s, visits first all the points in D at least once, then visits all the 
points in P at least once and finally returns to the origin s. 
 
 
[As an aside we note that the above heuristic is the best currently available for the 
TSPB, in terms of worst-case performance.]

 Twelve Bridges of Cambridge Problem 

 
Problem 6 :   
 
According to a famous Boston tourist web site, the “...Charles River Bike Path is a 16.7 
mile loop along the banks of the Charles, from the Museum of Science in downtown 
Boston to Watertown Square and back. The dozen bridges allow for a loop walk/bike of 
almost any length (see map above with distances over and between bridges).”  We at 
MIT have tabulated all of the land segment lengths and the bridge lengths, and we arrive 
at a total mileage of 18.27.  The stated figure of 16.7 miles is in fact the length of the 
outer loop or cycle, including all the land paths plus the two end bridges, the Watertown 
Square Bridge and the Science Museum (land) bridge.  The remaining 1.57 miles is the 
total length of the ten bridges between the two end ones.   The figure shows the distances 
between consecutive bridges on each side of the river.  The names of the twelve bridges 
are also shown along with the length of each bridge (in brackets, [ ]). The details are in 
the spreadsheet on the next page.  
 
(a)  Mr. Mike Jogger wants to run a route that covers every inch of the network of paths 
(on both sides of the river) and bridges at least once, but he wants to do it in minimum 
total distance.  Create such a shortest-distance jogging path for Mike.  What is the total 
distance he will have to run? 
 
(b) (True Story!) Jon, a former Ph.D. student at the MIT Operations Research Center 
jogged every day at lunchtime. The ORC is shown with a red ‘X’ on the map. He 
numbered the 12 bridges from 1 to 12, as shown on the spreadsheet.  Each day, to 
determine that day’s jogging route, he would pick two sample values of random variables 
that were uniformly independently distributed on the integers 1 to 12.  Those two 
experimental values would imply a jogging route.  For instance, if he obtained the 
numbers 3 and 7, he would leave MIT and jog to bridge 3 and cross it, jog from bridge 3 
to bridge 7 on the “Boston side” of the river, cross bridge 7, and then return back to MIT 
on the Cambridge side.  If he picked the same two numbers, say 3 and 3, he would go to 
bridge 3, cross it and then immediately make a U-turn and cross it again, and then return 
to MIT.  Carefully explain how you would determine the probability law for the random

variable, “the number of miles Jon jogs each day.”  Please make sure to define carefully 
any variables or quantities you use.  DO NOT work out the numerical details. 
 
(c) Suppose Jon could move his office to any land-based (i.e., not on a bridge) location 
on the network, thereby freeing himself from his MIT home location. 
 

(i)  Are there other locations on the network that would result in a lower mean 
distance jogged each day, assuming he still selects his jogging routes randomly as 
described above?  Can you identify one and explain why it is better than the original MIT 
location? 

 
(ii) How would you think about finding an optimal location for Jon, where 
optimal means minimizing mean mileage jogged per day?  Can you precisely formulate 
this problem?  Will an optimal solution exist solely on the set of nodes, i.e., the juncture 
points between the bridges and the banks of the river?

Problem 7: 
 
Suppose we have a network G(N, A) such as the one pictured in Figure 1, which can be 
separated by an “isthmus edge”, (s, t) into two distinct sub-networks G(S, As) and  
G(T, At) such that S∪T = N and As∪At∪(s, t) = A.  (Note that the set of nodes S includes 
node s and the set of nodes T includes node t.)  Let H(T) be the sum of the weights, hj, of 
the nodes in the set T and H(S) be the sum of the weights, hj, of the nodes in the set S.  
 
(a) The following is known as Goldman’s majority theorem”:  “If H(T)≥ H(S) then the 
set of nodes T contains at least one solution to the 1-median problem on G(N, A).” 
 
Prove the theorem.  To do so, assume that the solution is at some node y∈S and argue 
that J(y) ≥ J(t), which contradicts the assumption.  J(.) is the objective function for the 1-
median problem – see book.  Note as well that t is the node on the G(T, At) side of (s, t). 
 
(b) Prove the following theorem:  “If H(T)≥ H(S) then one can find a solution to the 
original 1-median problem on G(N, A) by solving the 1-median problem on the sub-
network G'(T, At) which is identical to G(T, At) except that the weight ht of the node t 
(on which the edge (s, t) is incident) is replaced by H(S) + ht.” 
 
To prove this statement argue as follows:  We know from part (a) that the 1-median is in 
T.  Show that for any node y∈T:

where C is a constant and (T-t) indicates the set of nodes, T, not including the node t.  
Why does (1) prove our theorem? 
 
(c) Using the theorems of parts (a) and (b) find very quickly the 1-median of the network 
shown in Figure 2.  (For each node, an identification letter followed by the node’s weight 
is indicated; link lengths are noted next to each link.)  Note that you do not have to 
consider the lengths of the edges in solving this problem.
