Lab work is divided into three modules. This page presents details only for the
first two modules. Details of the third module are not available in
OpenCourseWare, because the module is based on recent research that is being
prepared for formal publication.
For modules 1 and 2, each lab session is presented on a linked web page with an
introduction, protocol, and reagents list, followed by a "for next time"
homework assignment.

***** Orientation Session (First Class) *****
Lecturer: Dr. Natalie Kuldell
There are six stations for you and your lab partner to visit on this lab tour.
Some will be guided tours with a TA or faculty there to help you and others are
self-guided, leaving you and your partner to try things on your own. Your visit
to each station will last 10-15 minutes. It doesn't matter which station you
visit first but you must visit them all before you leave today. Your lab
practical next time will assess your mastery of each station.

***** Module 1: Genome Engineering *****
Instructors: Prof. Drew Endy, Dr. Natalie Kuldell, and Dr. Agi Stachowiak
Lecturer: Prof. Drew Endy
TA: Laure-Anne Ventouras
In this experiment, we will consider the genome of a virus, namely the
bacteriophage M13. M13 is a self-assembling nano-machine with a compact genome
that has been optimized by evolution to commandeer its bacterial host.
Approximately 1000 new viruses are generated from a single infection event.
Imagine harnessing this production. What could we build and what natural
processes could we better understand? One approach we'll take is to modify the
existing genome in a subtle but useful way, namely by adding a useful sequence-
tag that modifies the bacteriophage coat. We'll examine how this modification
affects the coat protein's expression and overall phage production. Another
approach we'll take is to start from scratch, undertaking a full throttle
redesign of the bacteriophage genome. We'll employ a commercial DNA synthesis
company to compile the redesigned genomic program and then we'll see if it
encoded infective M13 and if the genome of the bacterial host affects
bacteriophage production. Through these investigations we'll ask: is nature's
M13 genome "perfect" or can we do better?

***** Module 2: Expression Engineering *****
Instructors: Dr. Natalie Kuldell and Dr. Agi Stachowiak
Lecturer: Dr. Natalie Kuldell
TA: Alice Lo
In this experiment, we will consider unintended and unpredicted effects of an
experimental perturbation. Our goal is a precise one, namely to silence gene
expression of a measurable gene, luciferase, using RNA interference (RNAi).
Each group will begin by designing a short interfering RNA (siRNA) against
luciferase, but as we'll see, siRNAs can vary in efficacy and specificity.
After transfecting a mammalian cell line with the siRNA you've designed and a
reporter plasmid, we will evaluate the silencing using a luciferase assay and
microarray technology. The first assay evaluates the efficacy of the siRNA in
silencing. The second assay gives genome-wide expression data to reveal the
specificity of your siRNA for the gene you've targeted. Through this combined
approach, we'll assess the balance of targeted and off-target effects.

***** Module 3: Biomaterials Engineering *****
"Invention" is a wonderful word, derived from words meaning "scheme" and "a
finding out." Inventors draw on materials provided by the natural world,
refining and combining them in insightful ways, to make something useful. In
this experimental module we will invent materials by manipulating biological
systems, namely the bacteriophage M13. We will use a very slightly modified
phage to build Iridium nanowires that we'll visualize on the transmission
electron microscope. Then we'll let the phage themselves do the building,
making an electrochromic device that's both fun and potentially useful. Drawing
on the rich stockroom of biological elements and a good but incomplete
understanding of their behavior, we'll hope to invent some novel materials with
real-world applications.
