For many of you this will be the first time in a research lab and for others it
will not, but it is our goal to make this class a useful and fun introduction
to experiments and techniques in biological engineering. There is not time
enough to show you everything you'll need to know if you go on to do research,
but after taking this class you should feel confident and familiar with some
fundamental experimental approaches and lab protocols. You will develop good
habits at the bench, ones that will increase the likelihood of success in your
work and ensure the health and safety of you and those around you. By the end
of the semester, you should also be aware of good scientific practice, having
had some experience with report writing, notebook keeping and publicly
presenting your data. All of us involved in teaching 20.109 hope you will find
it a satisfying challenge and an exciting experience that has lasting value.
***** Course Meeting Times *****
Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1 hour / session
Labs: 2 sessions / week, 4 hours / session
***** How 20.109 Varies from Term to Term *****
20.109 is offered twice per year in the fall and spring semesters, with
rotating instructor responsibilities. Reflecting the instructors' specific
expertise and the evolving biological engineering field, the topics covered
will change over time. The fall term focus, led by Natalie Kuldell, reflects
her molecular genetics, microbiology, and synthetic biology expertise. The
spring_term focus reflects Agi Stachowiak's biomaterial and tissue engineering
background.
***** Layout of the Class: Labs and Assignments *****
You will perform three series of experiments (called 'modules') over the course
of the semester. The modules differ in length and in the ways you will be
assessed. The experiments and major assignments are:
                      Course major assignments.
MODULEÂ TOPICS                   MAJORÂ ASSIGNMENTS
1         Genome engineering       Portfolio
2         Expression engineering   Written report
3         Biomaterials engineering Oral presentation plus written text
Â 
You will be working as pairs throughout the semester, but you will submit
individual lab reports and give individual oral presentations.
In addition to the module assignments listed above, there are several other
forms of required coursework.
**** Journal Club ****
Each student will give an oral presentation on a paper associated with either
Module 1 or Module 2.
**** Daily Lab Quizzes ****
These are intended to refresh your memory about the experiment you are
performing. They will not be hard and should take no more than 5 minutes at the
beginning of lab. [These quizzes are not provided in this OCW site .]
**** Homework Assignments ****
These will vary considerably in content and points associated with each
assignment. You may be asked to perform a calculation, draw a conclusion, and/
or make a figure using the data you have collected. The homeworks can be found
in the "for next time" section of each lab day. You can work with your lab
partner, friends and teaching assistants on these assignments but you will hand
in individual assignments.
**** Laboratory Notebooks ****
You will record your data on the white pages of a bound notebook. The yellow,
duplicate pages will be collected and evaluated by the teaching assistants. Be
sure you follow the guidelines_for_lab_notebooks. Late work will be penalized
1/3 of a letter grade for each day late and will not be accepted after a week.
***** OpenWetWare Wiki *****
Since 20.109 is a lab class, we think the students, TAs and instructors would
benefit from having a shared space in which to discuss experimental protocols
and results. By putting all course materials on the 20.109_(Fall_2007)
OpenWetWare_Wiki , they can be updated and improved instantly by everyone (not
just the instructors).

***** Lab Attendance *****
Lab attendance is mandatory and there are no make-up labs. A family crisis or
severe illness requiring attention from the infirmary and prohibiting you from
all your coursework are acceptable reasons for missing lab and every effort
will be made to accommodate you in these exceptional circumstances.
***** Grading *****
              Grading criteria.
ACTIVITIES                         PERCENTAGES
