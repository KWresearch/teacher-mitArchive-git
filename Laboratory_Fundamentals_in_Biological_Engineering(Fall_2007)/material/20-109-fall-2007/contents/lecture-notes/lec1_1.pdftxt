Genome Engineering

Questions for Today 

A. What can we infer about the design of a genome by considering the physical 
problems that a biological system solves? 

B. How is genetic “real estate” divvied up? 

C. What makes a good genetic “part”?  What makes a good genome design? 

1. Let�s check out a time-lapse movie of bacteriophage lambda induction (all the movies 
in today�s class were taken by Francois St-Pierre, a biology graduate student).  Note 
what the bacterial cells are doing.  Reproducing and dividing.  I.e., they are reproducing 
machines.  This is no small feat.  Imagine building a machine that is only one micron 
long and that can copy itself!!! 

2. [Note that sometime this semester, I expect that a research paper should be pub­
lished that will show for the ﬁrst time that it is possible to construct a copy of a natural 
bacterial genome from scratch, and place this newly constructed into an empty cell, 
causing the cell to start growing and dividing.  Thus, while we are considering the de­
sign of a bacteriophage genome this in 20.109 this Fall, you should expect to be able to 
apply the concepts you learn here to design microbial and eukaryotic genomes soon 
enough]. 

3. OK, now note that the cells lyse (i.e., are destroyed).  In this case, a virus that was 
latent inside the bacterial cell became active, and destroyed the cells while in the proc­
ess of making more copies of itself.  What are the various functions that are required 
to destroy a cell while making progeny phage particles? 

4. Let�s check out a second movie.  In this case the lambda virus is not yet inside the 
cell.  The virus particles appear green because a protein (green ﬂuorescent protein) has 
been fused to one of the shell (i.e., capsid) proteins of the lambda particle.  As a result, 
all the particles glow green.  A few cells become infected by the phage and eventually 
produce more green particles, and in the process are destroyed.  What else can we 
now infer about these “strange” green particles?  What new functions must be 
present?

5. OK.  So, let�s take a look at M13, a different phage, the one that we�ll be focusing our 
attention on this term.  M13 usually does not destroy its host cell.  Instead it maintains 
some sort of stable existence with E. coli.  That is, an E. coli cell infected with phage 
M13 will continue to grow and divide, but will secrete M13 phage into to the extracellular 
environment.  Is such a lifestyle more or less sophisticated than what phage 
lambda does?  For example, would you expect that M13 requires more or less 
functions to infect E.coli, producing more phage but not killing it? 

6. [Note that we do not have a movie of M13 infection.  Perhaps somebody would 
like to make a GFP fusion to an M13 coat protein.  We could then make a movie of 
M13 infection and load it up on YouTube]. 

7.  From the above, make a list of the sorts of biochemical functions (activities, com­
mands, etc) that we expect M13 must have.  I.e., the list of things you would expect to 
see if you “lifted the lid” or “looked under the hood” of a M13 particle.  For example: 

�

�

�

�

�

�

 �

 �

 �

 �

 �

 �

 �

 �

 �

 �

 �

 �

 
 - particle protein (i.e., coat protein) 

 
 - landing gear protein (i.e., tail protein) 

 
 - constructing protein (i.e., assembly protein) 

 
 - secretory protein (i.e., something to get outside the cell) 

 
 - infection protein (i.e., something to inside a new cell) 

 
 - copy protein (i.e., something replicate the phage DNA) 

8. Could we also infer that there must some information storage mechanism?  I.e., 
a genome that encodes all these functions?  [Note that this question seems strange 
because we know that there is an M13 genome, but your grandparents would not have 
know this yet]. 

9.  OK, let�s get down to business.  How are these functions encoded on the ge­
nome?  [Sketch of boxes of different genes arrayed across a genome].  Different func­
tions are encoded as sequences of DNA.  For example, a protein will be encoded as a 
“coding sequence” (aka CDS).

10. Now, are these functions sufﬁcient by themselves?  Stated differently, how do we go 
from a CDS to a biochemical activity?  I.e., how are the DNA encoded functions read 
out inside the cell?  [Transcription, translation, and so on].  The key point here is that, in 
addition to coding sequences specifying different biochemical activities, we also need to 
think about controlling sequences that determine when and how much of different activi­
ties are produced.  In designing a system, control can be as important, or more 
important than the functions themselves (e.g., think of an furnace with no ther­
mostat, or a plane without any rudder or wing ﬂaps). 

11. So, we can infer that there must be elements for turning ON and OFF transcription, 
and for turning ON and OFF translation, and DNA replication. 

12. Let�s take a look at a few key types of bacterial genetic elements: 

12a.  The Promoter, champion of transcription initiation.  Standard promoters that oper­
ate inside E.coli will have what�s called a -35 region, and a -10 region.  These are the 
regions that interact with RNA polymerase, the enzyme that carries out transcription (by 
polymerizing an RNA molecule, copying the underlying DNA template).  The numbers 
-35 and -10 refer to the position on the DNA that the RNA polymerase binds prior to ini­
tiating transcription at the +1 site.  I.e., for such a promoter, the E.coli RNA polymerase 
binds upstream of where transcription starts (i.e., the transcription start site).  The exact 
sequence of a promote can vary, and as a result will act as a stronger or weaker pro­
moter (i.e., initiate more or less messenger RNA synthesis). A typical E.coli promoter will 
look like: 

� 

�

-- TTGACA -- (15-19 base pairs) --- TATAAT -- (a few more base pairs) -- START 

       (-35)� 

� 

� 

� 

(-10) 

12b. The Ribosome Binding Site (RBS), master of translation initiation.  Standard RBSs 
that operate inside E.coli will be about 7 base pairs long and will be positioned about 6 
base pairs upstream of the start of a CDS encoding a protein.  The exact sequence of 
an RNA can vary (as w/ promoters, sequence differences will produce different rates of 
protein synthesis initiation).  For example, a very strong RBS might have the sequence 
AGGAGG(nnnnnnn)ATG, where the underlined sequence in the RBS, and the seven n�s 
are any space sequence separating the RBS from the ATG start codon (what�s an ATG 
start codon?  hang on).  Note that you do not always need a “formal” RBS to start pro­
tein synthesis.  There are natural examples of proteins that are synthesized from mRNA

that do not appear to contain any RBSs!!!  [see the RBS “sequence logo” depiction be­
low for a depiction of sequence variation at E.coli RBSs].

12c.  The Coding Sequence (CDS), encoder of proteins!  Coding sequences will be 
made up of codons, triplets of DNA that deﬁne the genetic code for a particular organ­
ism.  64 codons can be deﬁned from the 4 bases.  Some codons specify what amino 
acid should be incorporated into a protein next.  Other codons deﬁne START and STOP 
sequences that control protein synthesis (i.e., translation).  For example, ATG and GTG 
are two “allowable” start codons in E. coli.  And, UAA, UAG, and UGA are three “allow­
able” stop codons.  A start codon will direct the initiation of protein synthesis (usually in 
partnership w/ a RBS).  A stop codon will halt protein synthesis.  A CDS is deﬁned 
as the sequence of DNA between a start and stop codon.

12c-bonus.  But, note that the start and stop codons need to be “in frame” in order to 
function as a pair.  In frame refers to the fact that codons are three base pairs long, so 
any strain of DNA contains three distinct reading frames, depending on which base you 
decide to start reading from.  And, if you consider the complementary strand of double 
stranded DNA, a sequence of DNA contains up to six (!!!) reading frames.  Stay tuned. 

13 . Enough.  Let�s take a look at an example DNA sequence.  What can you ﬁnd? 

gc[atgcgcaaagggaggcgac{ATGgcaggttacggcgctaa]aggaatccgaaatTGA}aaa 

14. What parts can you ﬁnd in the above sequence? 

15. What can you say about the architecture of genetic elements? 

16.  Why might this particular architecture be good or bad?
