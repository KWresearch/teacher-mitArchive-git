“the warmth of tumors made him wonder 
whether they, like the other tissue in the 
body, needed their own blood supply and 
whether they could be starved if that blood 
supply was cut off”

Genome-wide phenotype analysis
Arrays for RNAi drug discovery

“The researchers involved in the three-year, $18 million initiative successfully built a 
library of 160,000 custom-designed RNAi constructs targeting 15,000 human genes and 
15,000 mouse genes. They also developed methods to apply this library effectively for 
loss-of-function genetic screens. This fundamental resource is available to scientists 
worldwide through Sigma-Aldrich and Open Biosystems.”

Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)
• ssRNA enveloped virus of the 
Paramyxovirus family
• Responsible for 50-90% of Bronchiolitis
and 5-40% of Bronchopneumonia in 
infants
• RSV fusion protein allows virus to fuse 
with host cells, and then fuses 
neighboring cells into multinucleated 
masses
