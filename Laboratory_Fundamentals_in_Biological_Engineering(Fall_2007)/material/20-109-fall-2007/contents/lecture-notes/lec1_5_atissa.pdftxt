Before you begin…


Oral vs. written communication 
•  Challenge for the presenter: 
•  Time constraint on information presented


•  Challenge for the audience: 
•  Can’t control rate of presentation to match their 
comprehension 
•  Can’t re-read sections

Before you begin…


Ask yourself: 
•	 What is the main point I want to make to my 
audience? 
•	 Why is this interesting or important? 
•	 How do the data support my main point?

•	 What part of my story can I tell with the data 
in the allotted amount of time?

Before you begin…


Content is the Key! 
•  If there is no content, there is no presentation 

Know your material and its message 
•  Collect more information than you will use

•  Review the experiment 
•  Review graphs and charts 
•  Anticipate problem areas

Structuring the Presentation 


Tell a story 
•	 Narrative Structure 
•	 Beginning: introduction 
•	 Middle: data 
•	 End: summary 

•	 Show how each section relates to and builds 
upon the one before it 
•	 Engage the audience’s interest as they 
follow the narrative

Structuring the Presentation 


Introduction 
•  Introduce yourself 
•  Give the title (and author) of your talk 
•  In one sentence, introduce the central question 
or problem of the experiment 
•  State significance of experiment; why should we 
care? 
•  Briefly explain necessary background 
•  Give audience a preview of approach to problem

Structuring the Presentation 


Data 
•  Forms bulk of presentation 
•  Drawn from Methods, Results and Discussion of 
paper 
•  keep explanation of methods to a minimum -
-
only as much as needed to understand results

•  integrate discussion as you go 
•  Data are only worth presenting insofar as they 
relate to your central question

Structuring the Presentation 


Summary 
•  What do you want your audience to remember 
about your talk? 
•  Remind your audience of primary findings 
•  Explain what these findings contribute to the field

Structuring the Presentation 


Q & A 
•  Anticipate questions not covered in the 
presentation 
•  OK to bring extra slides 
•  OK to acknowledge gaps in expertise

•  Explain what you do know

Structuring the Presentation 


Arrange ideas in a logical sequence 
•  Most important point first 
•  Emphasize key points as you make them 
•  Provide explicit transitions between points 

Guide your audience through the logic

of the scientific process!

Structuring the Presentation 


Preview and Review 
•  Map out goals of the talk in advance 
•  Use topic sentences in body of the talk 
•  Summarize 
•  at end of each section

•  at end of your talk

Principles of Visual Support


Or: Why use slides at all?


Disadvantages: 
• disruptive -- pull 
audience’s attention away 
from the speaker and onto 
the screen 

Advantages: 
• can convey a point quickly 
• add variety and interest 
• audience recall increases 
dramatically when the 
speaker uses effective slides 

Ask yourself: What specific message are you trying to 
convey with your visual?

Direct the audience’s focus


Title all slides 
•  Headings should clarify the main 
point of each slide 
Use graphics liberally, keep 
them simple 
•  Average attention span

per slide is 8 seconds

Use clear, explanatory 
labels for charts and 
diagrams 
•  Make sure to label axes!

Less is More


Limit number of slides 
Say more than you show 
•  show primary points on slide; flesh out secondary points verbally 
Minimize text 
•  Don’t crowd your slides with a lot of text.  Especially, avoid using 
complete sentences -- or worse, complete paragraphs.  Either the 
audience will become engrossed in trying to read the text, and will 
stop paying attention to you, or else they’ll wonder why you didn’t 
just give them a handout already and save yourself the trouble of 
reading to them. 
Avoid potentially annoying animation 
• Really.

More Design Principles


Color 
•Be easy on the eyes; don’t distract from content 
•Avoid low-contrast combinations 

Type 
•Sans serif headings 
•Serif bullets

(serif “feet” make lines for

ease of reading)

•Type at least 20-24 pt 
•Limit upper-case type 

Arial
   - Times
 
Verdanda
  - Bookman

Placenta." J Biol Chem 264, no. 2 (January 15, 1989): 1317–1322.

What story does this 
picture tell? 
“As shown in Fig. 2, the 
loss of neuraminidase 
activity from the super-
natant coincides with 
the disappearance of 
this 66-kDa protein. 
This indicates that 
neuraminidase activity is 
precipitated via the 66-
kDa protein.”

Delivering the Presentation 


Rehearse! 
•  Practice at least 3 times 
•  Practice with a colleague for feedback 
•  Is your content clear? 
•  Do you rock, squirm, gesture too much? 
•  Is there room for improvements/adjustments? 
•  Time yourself 
•  What 3 questions will your audience likely ask?

Delivering the Presentation 


On Presentation Day… 
•  Arrive early 
•  Check equipment and voice projection

•  Bring a backup of your presentation

How to Connect with the Audience


Put yourself in the audience’s place 
•	 Use everyday language and terms 
•	 Explain novel ideas/terms or references 
Engage the audience 
•	 Establish eye contact; look at people 
•	 Convey enthusiasm; if you aren’t excited about your subject, 
your audience won’t be either 

A presentation is two-way communication 
•	 Pay attention to audience reaction; modify your talk as needed

Standing


•  Don’t block the screen! 
•  Stand at a 45-degree angle 
to the audience 
•  Keep weight evenly 
dispersed on both feet

Gesture and Movement


•	 Make non-verbal behavior deliberate; avoid extraneous 
motion 
•	 Some walking adds variety; too much is distracting 
•	 Use gestures that complement your speech’s content and are 
natural for you 
•	 Know what your body language says

Vocal Issues


Volume 
•	 Project to back of room: 
support voice from diaphragm

content 

Pitch 
•	 Keep pitch of your voice at a natural level
