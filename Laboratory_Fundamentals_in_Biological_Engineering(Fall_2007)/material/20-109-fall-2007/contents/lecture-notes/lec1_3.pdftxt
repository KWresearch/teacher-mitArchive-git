34. How does synthetic biology relate to genetic engineering? 

People have long been interested in using biology to solve problems, from food and 
shelter, to drug production and biofuels, and now a wider number of applications, includ­
ing building electronics, environmental monitoring and remediation, and perhaps even 
growing large-scale structures, like houses.  About 30 years ago researchers discov­
ered restriction endonucleases and invented recombinant DNA technology (rDNA). 
rDNA allows people to intentionally cut and paste pre-existing fragments of genetic ma­
terial (so long as the restriction sites are in the right places!).  This marked the begin­
ning of “genetic engineering.”  (What does it mean to be an engineer?) 

35. About the same time the rDNA technology got invented, polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) was ﬁgured out, with some of the foundational work being done here at MIT and 
then fully invented in the 1980s at Cetus, Inc.  As important, by 1977, DNA sequencing 
was ﬁgured out by Fred Sanger at Harvard.

36. Taken together, rDNA, PCR, and DNA sequencing form a core set of underlying 
technologies that allow for the editing and reading out of genetic material.  Since bio­
logical systems are encoded via genetic material, these are important technologies both 
biological science (e.g., change things and see what happens) and biological engineer­
ing (e.g., make something that does what you want, hopefully).  For whatever reasons, 
these three technologies form the basis of what has been called “genetic engi­
neering.”  It doesn�t really matter what you call it, so long as you appreciate what 
the technologies can do, and how to use them for constructive purposes. 

37. One important lesson across all of engineering is that, so much as it is possi­
ble, it is critically important to improve the tools that we use to solve problems. 
Building 32 was designed with computers, using computer aided design (CAD) software 
adapted from plane manufacture.  For that matter, the Boeing 777 was designed entirely 
on computer (so I am told).  Microprocessors can only be designed using CAD tools de­
veloped back in the 1970s.  And, let�s not forget the American System of Manufacturing, 
developed in Western Mass. and other places back in the early to mid 1800s (for pro­
ducing guns).  So, as a question, could we get better at reading DNA (i.e., sequenc­
ing).  And, could we get better at writing DNA (i.e., synthesis or construction)? 

38.  The answer to this question is obviously yes.  So, today, there are three new 
technologies being developed that aid in the process of engineering biological 
systems.  These three technologies are (a) automated DNA construction, (b) 
physical and functional composition (and other) standards, and (c) abstraction. 
Automated DNA construction, based on DNA synthesis, lets us make DNA from scratch, 
in place of bashing DNA together in the lab w/ rDNA and PCR.  Standards and abstrac­
tion help us manage the information going into the DNA synthesizers.  Taken together, 
these three new technologies extend and improve the underlying foundations of both 
biological science and engineering.  For whatever reasons, these three new technolo­
gies form the basis of what is now being called “synthetic biology.”  Again, it doesn�t 
really matter (to me) what you call it, so long as you know what is going on and why. 
And, as a ﬁnal comment, just like DNA sequencing (and PCR and rDNA) technology 
was fairly primitive in 1977 compared to today, many aspects of these three new foun­
dational technologies are immature.  We have to go make them happen if we want 
make biology easier to engineer. 

functional and physical composition. 

39.  As one example of functional composition,

Basically, a riboswitch is made from three parts.  A ribozyme, an aptamer, and a com­
munication domain.  A ribozyme is an RNA structure that has an enzymatic activity -- it 
can cut RNA (usually itself).  An aptamer is an RNA structure that can interact with an­
other chemical (e.g., a small molecule like caffeine).  A communication domain links the 
ribozyme and the aptamer together, so that when the ligand and present, the ribozyme 
is either activated or inactivated. 

40. The key advance in this engineered riboswitch work appears to be that the authors 
have ﬁgured out how to combine any aptamer with a ribozyme, in order to control ribo­
zyme activity (although they have only shown that two different aptamers work -- what 
could be some of the problems that might come up).  They�ve also ﬁgure out how to in­
tegrate their riboswitches into transcripts in order to control gene expression, and claim 
to be able to control the level of most any mRNA.  So, this work is an example of reli­
able functional composition.  Because functional composition appears to be 
working, you could be switches against most anything you can ﬁnd an aptamer 
for.  Question.  Do these authors present any results on reliable physical compo­
sition?  (Not that I can see). 

41.  Now, as an example of physical composition, Let�s take a look at the parts in the 
Registry of Standard Biological Parts (note that it is not called the Registry of Biological 
Parts, so there must be something different about Standard Biological Parts, right?).  It 
turns out that the parts currently in the Registry are called BioBrick parts (one “brand” of 
standard biological parts, although there are not yet any competing brands of standard 
biological parts).  The BioBrick parts follow a particular scheme (invented by Tom 
Knight here at MIT)  that supports physical composition.  How does this scheme 
work? 

42.  Each BioBrick part is bracketed by the same four restriction endonuclease sites:

43.  As a result of bracketing each part with these four sites, you can put any two parts 
together, and the resulting composite part is bracketed with the same four sites (i.e., you 
have a new part!). 

44.  So, the BioBricks standard assembly scheme is an example of reliable physical 
composition.  But, note, this says nothing about functional composition, per se. 

Questions 

Which would you rather have, reliable physical composition, or functional composition? 

What sort of functional composition issues can we begin to think about with the parts 
that make up phage M13?
