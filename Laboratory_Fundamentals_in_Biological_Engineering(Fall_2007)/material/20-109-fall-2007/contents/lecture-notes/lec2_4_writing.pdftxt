Some summary comments on Mod. 1 
Portfolios, Parts 1 and 4 

 Audience: Imagine for both the editorial rebuttal and the 
business plan that your reader is a fairly general one, i.e., not 
familiar with the assignment or its context. 
 Rebuttal: You’l l need to explain/summarize fully the point that you 
are rebutting (to be fair, at least). 
 Business plan: Write as if you’re proposing to an outside funding 
source, one not necessarily familiar with the Registry and its 
context. 
 Justification: 
 Rebuttal: Be sure to justify why it is important to draw a 
distinction between genetic engineering and biological engineering 
(i.e., answer the readers’  “why should I care?” question). 
 Business plan: Be sure to focus on a problem that your plan is the 
solution for. If everything is working well, why propose a change? 
 I’d be glad to conference with you to talk about your revision!

What do you as a reader expect to happen in a 
research article? 

 An abstract (summarizes the paper quickly) 
 In the intro, a summary of the area, why the problem is important. 
 Results! 
 A methods that allows another to replicate the experiment. 
 Background information to give context. 
 Some sort of conclusion based on the results. 
 Figures that summarize the data. 
 References to previous research. 
 A summary (to remind me of what’s important and what the “take-
home message”  is. 
 Discussion that explains the results. 
 Order and cohesiveness to all of this. 

A Brief History of the Research Article 
from Swales (1990) 

 Mid-17th century: Robert Boyle presents his 
pneumatic experiments to the Royal 
Society, public presentations before 
“witnesses”  in order to seek agreement on 
the results. 
 1665: The Philosophical Transactions of the 
Royal Society is established, the first 
scientific periodical. 
 By 1800 “the definition of experiment moves 
from any made or done thing, to an 
intentional investigation, to a test of theory, 
to finally a proof of evidence for a claim” 
(Bazerman 1983). 
 By 1900, the current format of research 
article is largely established.

In both processes language is a tool of both discovery 
and communication.

enabled by language.

“Language, oral or written, is an expressive instrument 
through which we communicate what we have previously 
thought [or discovered].  It is also the reflective instrument 
through which we think, alone or with others, about what 
we are doing.”  Paul Connolly 

Scientific writers need to control the 
rhetoric of scientific writing.

According to Aristotle, rhetoric is “the art of 
finding in any given case the available means 
of persuasion.”

The goal of scientific writing is to court 
your audience. 

Michael Halloran on Watson & Crick’s 
1953 “The Structure for DNA” 
“The April 1953 paper, then, 
is really just the initial move 
in a rhetorical strategy aimed 
at gaining and holding the 
attention of an audience. As 
such, it presumes an 
understanding of science as a 
human community in which 
neither facts nor ideas speak 
 
for themselves, and the 
attention of the audience 
must be courted.”

Writers balance the relationship between

List the steps in your writing process for the Mod. 2 
Introduction: 

3.	

1.	 Organized ideas/brainstorm what to write (based on 
previous knowledge and research conducted). 
2.	 Created an empty shell of the structure (to be filled), 
i.e., an outline. 
Tried to think of larger story used to open the intro; 
what would audience related to? 
Find the information (do research on databases, in 
readings, etc.) 
Find out what info you need to find (look through 
previous outline, decide what your uncertain about). 
Look at lab notebook, assigment, experimental 
protocol, class Wiki 
7.	 Decide what was relevant (based on background 
reading).

Modeling the writing process lets us know at 
which points we encounter trouble. 

Goals/Questions for the Writer 
What do I know about my topic? 
What is my purpose for writing? 
Who are my intended readers and how much 
do they know about my topic? 
How is this task like others I have had before? 
What structure will work best for my topic?

Episode 1: Planning 

Episode 2: Drafting 

Episode 4: Editing 

Episode 3: Revising

Effective writers are able to self-monitor their 
composing strategies 

1.	 Declarative Knowledge: Knowing what 
strategies are available 
2.	 Procedural Knowledge: Knowing how to 
use a strategy. 
3.	 Conditional Knowledge: Knowing how 
and when to use a strategy.

The goal is to develop all three types of knowledge about 
each phase of the writing process.

What is the purpose of an abstract? 

•	 A stand alone, mini-version of the 
paper (250 words or less). 
•	 Describes the main sections of the 
paper. 
•	 States the purpose, findings, and 
impact of the work. 
•	 The goal is an economy of words. 

The Essentials of an Abstract 
from the UW Madison Writing Center 

In an abstracts you address this question: 
– What is the report about, in miniature and

without too much detail?

By doing the following 
– State main objectives: What did you

investigate? Why?

– Describe methods: What did you use? 
– Summarize the most important results: What 
did you find out? 
– State major conclusions and significance: What 
do your results mean? So what?)

Abstract unscramble 
Zebrafish are useful vertebrates in which to carry out large-scale
mutagenic screens to identify developmentally important genes. 
In order to follow the development of the zebrafish immune system,
we previously isolated and characterized the recombination activating 
genes, rag1 and rag2. 
This paper describes the cloning and characterization of another
such marker, ika1, which encodes a zinc finger transcription factor
necessary for early lymphocyte differentiation. 
Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed expression of ika1 in 24 hr
embryos in the intermediate cell mass, the first site of hematopoiesis 
(Weinstein et al., 1996), and the head. 
We also report the continuing efforts to create transgenes with the 
green fluorescent protein-coding region under the control of the 
promoters of rag1 and ika1. 
Fish containing these transgenes could then be mutagenized and 
screened quickly and easily for mutations in the immune system. 

Abstract Exercise: Lessons for Writing Science 

•	 It is essential to understand the 
rhetorical functions of units of 
discourse (large: abstract; 
small: sentence within the 
abstract) 
•	 You need to bring to bear what 
you know (whether tacit or 
explicit knowledge) on the 
writing task at hand. 
•	 Scientific writing has particular 
rhetorical requirements.
