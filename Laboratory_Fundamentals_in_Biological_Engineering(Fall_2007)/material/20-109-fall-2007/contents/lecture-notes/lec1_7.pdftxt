Biosafety Level 1 practices, safety equipment, and facility design and construction are appropriate for undergraduate 
and secondary educational training and teaching laboratories, and for other laboratories in which work is done with 
deﬁned and characterized strains of viable microorganisms not known to consistently cause disease in healthy adult 
humans. Biosafety Level 1 represents a basic level of containment that relies on standard microbiological practices with 
no special primary or secondary barriers recommended, other than a sink for handwashing. 

Biosafety Level 2 practices, equipment, and facility design and construction are applicable to clinical, diagnostic, 
teaching, and other laboratories in which work is done with the broad spectrum of indigenous moderate-risk agents that 
are present in the community and associated with human disease of varying severity. With good microbiological 
techniques, these agents can be used safely in activities conducted on the open bench, provided the potential for 
producing splashes or aerosols is low. Hepatitis B virus, HIV, the salmonellae, and Toxoplasma spp. are representative of 
microorganisms assigned to this containment level. 

Biosafety Level 3 practices, safety equipment, and facility design and construction are applicable to clinical, diagnostic, 
teaching, research, or production facilities in which work is done with indigenous or exotic agents with a potential for 
respiratory transmission, and which may cause serious and potentially lethal infection. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, St. 
Louis encephalitis virus, and Coxiella burnetii are representative of the microorganisms assigned to this level. Primary 
hazards to personnel working with these agents relate to autoinoculation, ingestion, and exposure to infectious aerosols. 
At Biosafety Level 3, more emphasis is placed on primary and secondary barriers to protect personnel in contiguous 
areas, the community, and the environment from exposure to potentially infectious aerosols. 

Biosafety Level 4 practices, safety equipment, and facility design and construction are applicable for work with 
dangerous and exotic agents that pose a high individual risk of life-threatening disease, which may be transmitted via the 
aerosol route and for which there is no available vaccine or therapy. Agents with a close or identical antigenic 
relationship to Biosafety Level 4 agents also should be handled at this level. When sufﬁcient data are obtained, work with 
these agents may continue at this level or at a lower level. Viruses such as Marburg or Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic 
fever are manipulated at Biosafety Level 4.  The primary hazards to personnel working with Biosafety Level 4 agents are 
respiratory exposure to infectious aerosols, mucous membrane or broken skin exposure to infectious droplets, and 
autoinoculation. All manipulations of potentially infectious diagnostic materials, isolates, and naturally or experimentally 
infected animals, pose a high risk of exposure and infection to laboratory personnel, the community, and the 
environment.

1. Databases populated with sequence information. 
2.The internet. 
3. Early returns on pilot investments in DNA 

construction technology.

4. Overnight shipping. 
5. Expanded concern re: active misapplication of
