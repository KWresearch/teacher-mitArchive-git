***** Module 1: Genome Engineering *****
Instructors: Prof. Drew Endy, Dr. Natalie Kuldell, and Dr. Agi Stachowiak
Lecturer: Prof. Drew Endy
TA: Laure-Anne Ventouras
In this experiment, we will consider the genome of a virus, namely the
bacteriophage M13. M13 is a self-assembling nano-machine with a compact genome
that has been optimized by evolution to commandeer its bacterial host.
Approximately 1000 new viruses are generated from a single infection event.
Imagine harnessing this production. What could we build and what natural
processes could we better understand? One approach we'll take is to modify the
existing genome in a subtle but useful way, namely by adding a useful sequence-
tag that modifies the bacteriophage coat. We'll examine how this modification
affects the coat protein's expression and overall phage production. Another
approach we'll take is to start from scratch, undertaking a full throttle
redesign of the bacteriophage genome. We'll employ a commercial DNA synthesis
company to compile the redesigned genomic program and then we'll see if it
encoded infective M13 and if the genome of the bacterial host affects
bacteriophage production. Through these investigations we'll ask: is nature's
M13 genome "perfect" or can we do better?

***** Module 2: Expression Engineering *****
Instructors: Dr. Natalie Kuldell and Dr. Agi Stachowiak
Lecturer: Dr. Natalie Kuldell
TA: Alice Lo
In this experiment, we will consider unintended and unpredicted effects of an
experimental perturbation. Our goal is a precise one, namely to silence gene
expression of a measurable gene, luciferase, using RNA interference (RNAi).
Each group will begin by designing a short interfering RNA (siRNA) against
luciferase, but as we'll see, siRNAs can vary in efficacy and specificity.
After transfecting a mammalian cell line with the siRNA you've designed and a
reporter plasmid, we will evaluate the silencing using a luciferase assay and
microarray technology. The first assay evaluates the efficacy of the siRNA in
silencing. The second assay gives genome-wide expression data to reveal the
specificity of your siRNA for the gene you've targeted. Through this combined
approach, we'll assess the balance of targeted and off-target effects.
