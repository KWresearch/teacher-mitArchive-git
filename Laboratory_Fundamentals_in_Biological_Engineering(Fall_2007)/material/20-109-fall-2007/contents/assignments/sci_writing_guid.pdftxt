Introductions 

What’s an Introduction? 
 An introduction is a method to familiarize and orient your readers. 
 The content of an introduction depends on its purpose and the audience. 
 All models share a direct approach.  Don’t hide your main point or save it until the end of 
the paper. 

What’s the Purpose of an Introduction in Scientific Writing? 
 Provide the context of your work (create your research space, define gap in knowledge, set 
up the direction you’ll take in your discussion section). 
 State your focus (hypothesis, question). 
 Provide justification for your work (how your work can answer the question). 

What are Some Common Pitfalls of an Introduction Section? 
 Including unnecessary background or being repetitive. 
 Exaggerating (or understating) the importance of your work. 
 Using lackluster openers and weak follow-through in the body of your introduction. 
 Not grounding the work in a context that will be important to your reader. 
 Not focusing on a clear and compelling research question or hypothesis. 

Guidelines for Introductions from Two Scientific Organizations
From the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors: 
State the purpose of the article and summarize the rationale for the study or observation. Give
only strictly pertinent references and do not include data or conclusions from the work being
reported.
From the American Society for Microbiology: 
The introduction should supply sufficient background information to allow the reader to 
understand and evaluate the results of the present study without referring to previous
publications on the topic. The introduction should also provide the hypothesis that was addressed 
or the rationale for the present study. Use only those references required to provide the most
salient background rather than an exhaustive review of the topic. 

Methods 

What are Some Goals of a Methods Section? 
 Present the experimental design. 
 Provide enough detail to allow readers to interpret your results.

Lerner & Ogren, A Guide to Scientific Writing 
p. 2 
 Give enough detail for readers to replicate your work.
“The key to a successful Methods section is to include the right amount of detail--too 
much, and it begins to sound like a laboratory manual; too little, and no one can repeat 
what was done.” 
Successful Scientific Writing, 2nd ed. 

What are Some Pitfalls of a Methods Section? 
 Providing too little or too much information. 
 Reiterating published methods rather than citing them. 
 Writing strictly in chronological order (alternatives: most important first, most fundamental 
first, etc.). 
 Methods and results don’t correspond (you have to provide methods for all the experiments 
you report). 
 Forgetting to use visual organizers that direct readers to specific aspects of the methods 
section, e.g., subheads. 
 Using a “dangling modifier” because of an over-reliance on passive voice:
“After scraping the desired plate in four swipes, the bacteria were placed in 8ml of media
with no antibodies.” 
 Failing to provide a context for the methods themselves: 
“In order to . . . , we . . . “ ⇐ context for the particular method is provided. 
 Writing a Protocol rather than a Methods section.
A Protocol is . . . 
A series of steps to be carried out.

Written in sequential or temporal order.

Intended for the reader to achieve a final result.

A Methods Section is . . 
A series of steps already completed and is written in past tense.

Written in logical order.

Intended for the reader to replicate the experiment.


Results 

What is the Purpose of the Results Section? 
 Objectivity: Make the data, just the data, easy to find.
Some readers want to interpret your data themselves rather than accepting the
interpretation presented in the discussion. 
 Description: Describe the data presented in figures and tables. 

What Differentiates Results from the Methods? 
 Methods = How the data were accumulated. 
 Results = What data were accumulated. 

What Differentiates Results from the Discussion? 
 Results = Data presentation (“Experiments showed that . . . .”) 
 Discussion = Data interpretation (“Experiments suggest that . . . .”)

p. 3 

What are the Contents of a Results Section? 
 A brief description of the experiment or rationale at the beginning of each subsection (“In
order to . . . . As a result, we found that . . . .). 
 The data (in past tense). 
 Descriptive text for FEW determinations. 
 Tables or graphs for REPETITIVE determinations. 
 The data that your methods indicated you would produce (and answering the questions you 
established in your introduction). 

What are Some Qualities of a Well-Written Results Section? 
 Methods and Results Correspond. 
i.e., no experimental results for which there are no methods, and vice versa. 
 Results are presented in a logical order. 
e.g., most important first, most fundamental first, etc. 
 Results focus on the question(s) or hypothesis introduced earlier in the paper. 

What are Some Pitfalls of a Results Section? 
 Overstating the results (e.g., “Figure 1 clearly shows…”) 
 Reporting irrelevant results: Although it is sometimes useful to report experiments that 
didn’t work. 
 Omitting visual organizers, such as subheads. 
 Including inappropriate illustrations. 
 Including methods and/or discussion: Overlap is acceptable in some circumstances. 

Illustrations 

What’s the Purpose of Illustrations? 
 Condense large amounts of information 
 Convince readers of your findings (by showing data quality). 
 Focus attention on certain findings (e.g., relationship between values). 
 Simplify complex findings. 
 Promote thinking and discussion. 
Illustration Caveat: The most beautiful illustration cannot hide lousy content--content is key. 

What are Some Pitfalls of Figures and Titles/Captions?
Figures 
 Not mentioned in text. 
 Textual data inconsistent with figures. 
 Mislabeling. 
 Symbols, data points, unreadable or cluttered. 
 Ugliness (failure to get help from graphic designer). 
Captions 
 Reiterate results section 
 Written in shorthand, abbreviated form rather than whole sentences.

Provide Textual Context for Your Illustrations 
In the body of your article: 
 Refer explicitly to the illustration (e.g., “see Table 1,” “refer to Figure 3.”)
Tell the reader: 
 How the graphic advances, supports, clarifies, or summarizes your discussion. 
 Why it is important. 
 What it means. 
 How it supports your argument.

Examples of Effective Titles/Legends
Figure 1. Initial velocity vs. ONPG substrate concentration for His461. ONPG was added to 
β-galactosidase extracted from E. coli His461. The initial rates were measured using 
spectrophotometer A420  readings.
Table 1. Increase of Initial Velocity with Increase of Enzyme Concentration. As the 
concentration of the enzymes His461 and CSH36 are increased, the rate of A420  reading 
increases, as does the initial velocity (in nmol ONP/ml/min).

is drawn to determine the protein concentration of samples with known optical densities. 

Discussion/Conclusion 

What is the Purpose of a Discussion Section? 
 Summarize findings presented in the results section 
 Cite supporting literature. 
 Explain discrepancies between your findings and previous reports. 
 Point out shortcomings of your work and define unsettled points. 
 Discuss theoretical and practical implications of your work. 
 End with a short summary or conclusion about the work’s importance. 

Questions You Will Address in a Discussion Section 
 What did you expect to find, and why? 
 How did your results compare with those expected? 
 How might you explain any unexpected results? 
 How might you test these potential explanations? 

Tips for Writing a Discussion Section
“This is the place to interpret your results against a background of existing knowledge. Explain
what is new in your work, and why it matters. Discuss both the limitations and the implications
of your results, and relate observations to other relevant studies. State new hypotheses when 
warranted, clearly labeled as such. Include recommendations, when appropriate.” 

Eight Common Components of a Discussion Section (Swales) 
 Background information 
 Statement of results 
 (Un)expected outcome 
 Reference to previous research 
 Explanation 
 Exemplification 
 Deduction and Hypothesis 
 Recommendation 

What is the Purpose of a Conclusion?
“Besides presenting an analysis of the key results in the conclusion sections, you also give a
future perspective on the work. In some documents that future perspective might be

p. 6 
recommendations. In other documents that future perspective might be a nod to the direction in 
which your research will head. A third kind of future perspective is to mirror the scope and 
limitations that you presented in the beginning of the document.” 

What are the Pitfalls of a Discussion/Conclusion Section? 
 Including too much information (wordy arguments, not focused, meandering, etc.). 
 Failure to follow arguments set up in the introduction. 
 Failure to focus on the current results. 
 Speculating too much or not enough. 
 Improper tense (Discussion largely in present tense). 
 Hedging excessively. 

Excessive Hedging
“The cause of the degenerative changes is unknown but possibly one cause may be infection by a

presumed parasite.”

Rule of thumb: One hedge word per sentence!


Titles/Abstracts 

What is the purpose of an abstract? 
 A stand alone, mini-version of the paper (250 words or less). 
 Summarizes the main sections of the paper. 
 States the purpose, findings, and impact of the work. 

Abstracts: The Goal is an Economy of Words 
 Provide an abstracted version of your paper in as few words as possible. 
 Choose each word carefully. Make them clear and significant. 
 Provide only the key points. 

Language: Needless Words in parentheses
(already) existing 
Mix (together

At (the) present (time) 
Never (before)

None (at all)

(basic) fundamentals 
(completely) eliminate 
Now (at this time)

(continue to) remain 
Period (of time)

(currently) being 
(currently) underway 
(separate) entities

(empty) space

What are Some Pitfalls of Abstracts? 
 Contains extraneous detail or information or conclusions not stated in the paper. 
 Contains abbreviations, chemical formulas, jargon or references to the literature, tables, or 
figures.

 Failure to state the purpose of the work at the outset. 
 Failure to state the importance of the work and where it leads at the end. 

What is the Purpose of a Title? 
 Indicate the subject of your research. 
 Distinguish your research from others of its kind. 
 Show continuity with preceding papers. 
 Provide key words for indexing. 

The Importance of Titles
“The title is the single most important phrase of a scientific document. The title tells readers
what the document is. If your title is inexact or unclear, many people for whom you wrote the 
document will never read it.” 

What are Some Pitfalls of Titles? 
 Too general or too specific. 
 Too long or too short. 
 Incomprehensible (sometimes from the use of jargon). 
 Inaccurate (often a syntax problem). 
 Contains abbreviations, chemical formulas, jargon.
