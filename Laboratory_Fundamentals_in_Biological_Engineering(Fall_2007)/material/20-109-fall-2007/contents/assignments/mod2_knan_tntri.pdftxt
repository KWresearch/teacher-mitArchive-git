Experimental siRNA Targeting the 469-624bp Region of Renilla Luciferase is 
Ineffective in Reducing Expression in Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells 
Jessica Keenan and Augusto Tentori 

Abstract 
dsRNA is an increasingly well studied and widely used tool for the regulation of 
gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.  In this experiment, we designed an 
siRNA intended to specifically target the Renilla reniformis luciferase gene in order to 
reduce the amount of luciferase produced by the gene.  However, Luciferase assays of the 
lysates from mouse embryonic stem cells transfected with this siRNA and a plasmid 
containing the Renilla luciferase gene suggest that the designed siRNA is not able to 
reduce Renilla luciferase expression.  Moreover, microarray analysis suggests that the 
siRNA has widespread off-target effects.  Over 8,000 genes were differentially expressed 
between cells transfected with the luciferase-containing plasmid only, and those 
transfected with the experimental siRNA and the plasmid.  There is no clear pattern 
between the genes that showed the greatest differential expression between the two 
samples.  Thus, we have determined the experimental siRNA is not able to specifically 
reduce Renilla luciferase expression, and instead has many off-target effects.  To make 
RNAi a more useful tool than traditional techniques like homologous recombination, 
further research must be done to improve siRNA design algorithms. 

Introduction 
In order to perform their specified functions, cells must constantly regulate the 
amount and types of proteins they produce.  When a cell is no longer able to properly 
regulate protein production, cell death or defects in the tissue or organism often result. 
For example, cancer is often caused by decreased production of proteins that inhibit cell 
growth, or by over production of proteins that cause the cell to continuously divide. 
Healthy cells, however, are able to regulate their protein expression at many levels, 
including transcription, translation, and after transcription and translation. 
One way in which cells regulate protein expression at the post-transcriptional 
level is by preventing the translation of the mRNA transcript in a process called RNA 
interference (RNAi).  RNAi, which occurs in organisms as diverse as C. elegans (Fire 
1998), planarians (Sánchez-Alvarado 1999), and humans (Elbashir 2001), uses a double-
stranded piece of RNA (dsRNA) to prevent the translation of a target mRNA transcript. 
One strand of the dsRNA is complementary to a region of the target mRNA. This strand 
is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) by a process that is not 
well understood, but is believed to involve the Argonaute family of proteins (Song 2003). 
The RISC then binds to the complementary sequence on the mRNA target and cuts the 
mRNA transcript.  The cleaved mRNA is degraded completely, and thus will not be 
translated into protein. 
Understanding how the RNAi pathway works is beneficial not only because it 
explains a natural means of protein expression regulation, but also because the induction 
of this pathway in the laboratory provides a means of artificially regulating protein 
expression.  siRNAs can be designed to target a specific mRNA transcript with the intent 
of reducing the amount of protein translated from the transcript.  However, there are 
many ambiguities associated with the design of effective and specific siRNAs. For

example, it is unclear if targeting a specific region in the mRNA transcript results in 
stronger RNAi. Thus, it is a common practice to design several different siRNAs to target 
different regions of the mRNA transcript with the hope that at least one of them will be 
effective.  Similarly, there is no single set of siRNA properties that guarantees the 
construct’s success.  Several different properties, including G/C content, melting 
temperature, and free energy, have been found to influence specificity and efficacy of the 
siRNA (Ambion Design URL), but there is no algorithm that can consistently produce an 
siRNA that is highly specific and effective for a given target. As a result, siRNA design is 
often hit-or-miss. 
The addition of siRNA into a cell may also have more wide-reaching effects than 
regulating the translation of the target mRNA. siRNA can alter the translation levels of 
off-target mRNAs, often because of similarities in sequences between the mRNA 
transcripts.  Moreover, the presence of dsRNA in a cell may be interpreted as a viral 
infection, and as a result, the anti-viral interferon pathway may be triggered upon 
treatment with siRNA.  Thus, siRNA treatment can result in the altered regulation of 
many genes besides the intended target. 
In order to validate and explore the effects of RNAi on the regulation of protein 
expression, DNA microarrays are particularly useful because they can assess the relative 
expression levels of tens of thousands of genes at one time.  In this technique, a slide or 
other surface is coated with DNA from the genes of interest.  RNA is then isolated from 
the sample cells, reverse transcribed, and labeled.  The resulting cDNA is hybridized to 
the array, allowing labeled sample DNA to bind to complementary sequences on the 
array.  Relative gene expression can then be determined by looking at the relative amount 
of label on each spot. 
Assays based on the functions of the protein encoded by a target gene can also be 
useful for measuring gene expression levels.  One protein that has readily-measured 
expression levels is Renilla reniformis luciferase.  Renilla reniformis is a soft coral that 
has the ability to bioluminesce by producing a luciferase protein.  This enzyme oxidizes 
the small molecule luciferin, which results in the emission of blue light (20.109 
Transfection URL).  By measuring the light emitted by different samples expressing this 
gene, relative expression levels may be determined, as cell extracts that emit more light 
express more luciferase than those that emit lower levels of light. 
The purpose of this experiment was to design an siRNA with the ability to reduce 
the production of the Renilla luciferase protein in mouse embryonic stem cells that 
produce Renilla luciferase. We used a plasmid containing Renilla luciferase to transfect 
mouse embryonic stem cells, enabling them to bioluminesce.  Mouse cells were used 
because they do not naturally bioluminesce, so any bioluminescence must be due to the 
transfected luciferase plasmid.  Moreover, they do not contain mechanisms for regulating 
luciferase production, so any changes in bioluminescence must be due to our treatment of 
the cells.  The transfected cells were also treated with an siRNA that was designed to 
bind to the Renilla luciferase mRNA transcript, resulting in its cleavage and decreased 
production of the luciferase protein.  Luciferase expression was first quantified by 
measuring the amount of light emitted by the extracts of transfected cells.  The cells were 
also visually monitored to assess if the siRNA had any off-target effects that inhibited 
growth.  To further assess off-target effects, we ran a microarray with cDNA reverse 
transcribed from mRNA isolated from the samples.  By designing and testing this siRNA

we were able to determine how effective it was, which indicates the effectiveness of the 
techniques we used to design it. 

Materials and Methods 
All protocols are taken from the 20.109 Fall 2007 class wiki: 
http://openwetware.org/wiki/20.109(F07) 

DNA and RNA 
The psiCHECK2 plasmid (GenBank accession number AY535007), which contains the 
Renilla luciferase and Firefly luciferase genes was used to enable the mouse embryonic 
stem cells to express the luciferase genes. Its sequence was obtained from Promega.com 
to allow us to identify a target sequence to which a dsRNA could specifically bind. 
Ambion’s siRNA Target Finder (Ambion Target Finder URL) was then used to find 
targets in the 469-624bp range of the Renilla Luciferase gene, using the options “ends 
with TT,” “all G/C contents,” and “avoid four or more C/Gs in a row.”  This program 
also provided the G/C content for each target sequence, and candidates with a G/C 
content higher than 50% or lower than 30% were not taken into further consideration. 
Integrated DNA Technology’s Oligo Analyzer (IDT URL) was then used to obtain the 
melting temperature of each of the remaining candidate sequences, and OligoCalc 
(OligoCalc URL) was used to determine the candidate’s free energy.  Low Tm  and free 
energy values are favorable, because they suggest the sequence will not have significant 
secondary structure that could interfere with binding.  Finally, each candidate was 
BLASTed against the mus musculus genome to find other sequences that the siRNA 
might target.  Only one candidate had a relatively low melting temperature (compared to 
the other candidates), a relatively low free energy, and only a few matching sequences in 
the mouse genome.  Thus, this candidate was chosen for use in the siRNA experiment. 

Mouse Embryonic Cell Culture and Transfection 
The mouse embryonic stem cells were maintained in JI growth media, consisting of 
DMEM (high glucose), 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 100U/ml Pen/Strep, 0.3mg/ml 
glutamine, and 50ul/L LIF.  The cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37oC 
with five percent CO2.  Samples of cells were transfected with the psiCHECK2 plasmid 
only, a validated siRNA sequence only, both the plasmid and the validated siRNA, both 
the plasmid and a scrambled version of the siRNA with no homology to the mouse 
genome, and both the plasmid and the experimental siRNA, in order to allow them to 
express the luciferase genes, and to allow the siRNA to regulate the expression of those 
genes. The pisCHECK2 plasmid was transfected at a concentration of 10ug 
plasmid/100ul transfection, and the siRNA at a concentration of 5pmol RNA/100ul 
transfection.  The carrier for the lipofection was prepared by diluting Lipofectamine 2000 
3:50 in OptiMEM.  It was then allowed to sit, undisturbed, at room temperature for about 
15min.  The DNA and RNA were prepared for transfection by diluting the plasmid 
1:2500 in OptiMEM and/or diluting the siRNA 1:5x106  in OptiMEM.  Equal volumes of 
the carrier and DNA/RNA mixtures were combined and allowed to incubate for 20 min at 
room temperature.  The cells were washed with PBS before the growth media was 
replaced with pre-transformation media, composed of the growth media without 
antibiotics.  Enough of the appropriate DNA/RNA/lipofectamine mixtures were added to

each well of cells to make the media a 9.5% lipofection mixture.  The media was changed 
to growth media after 24 hours and lysates were prepared from the cells after 48 hours to 
analyze luciferase activity. 

Luciferase Assays 
In order to measure the levels of luciferase expression in the samples, the light emitted 
from cell lysates was measured.  Each well of cells growing in a six-well plate was 
washed two times with 2ml PBS. To induce lysis, 500ul of Promega’s PLB reagent was 
added and the cells were then placed on an orbital rocker at 150rpm for 15min at room 
temperature.  Then, 10ul of the cell lysate was added to 50ul of LARII from Promega’s 
dual-luciferase assay kit, which contains beetle luciferin.  After pipet mixing, the Firefly 
luciferase activity was immediately measured with the Turner Luminometer 20/20 for 10 
seconds.  Then, 50ul of “Stop and Glo” from Promega’s dual-luciferase assay kit was 
added to mixture, and the Renilla luciferase activity was measured immediately after 
pipet mixing. 

Mouse Whole Genome Microarray 
Total RNA Isolation 
RNA was isolated from the cells using Qiagen’s RN-easy kit according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions.  This process was done to provide a template for the reverse 
transcription reaction that would produce the cDNA needed to hybridize to the 
microarray.  The concentrations of the RNA samples were then determined by taking 
spectrophotometer readings at 260nm. 

Reverse Transcription 
The RNA from the cell lysates was reverse transcribed to allow it to hybridize to the 
microarray.  The largest amount of RNA that could be taken from the most dilute sample 
without exceeding 10ul was 2.56ug, so this amount was reverse transcribed from each 
sample.  The volume of the remaining sample was brought to 10ul with RNase-free 
water.  Then, 1ul of primer/Capture Sequence I (red) was added to the sample that had 
been transfected with only plasmid, and 1ul of primer/Capture Sequence II (blue) was 
added to the sample that had been transfected with plasmid and the experimental siRNA. 
The primers were annealed to the RNA by heating these mixtures at 80oC for 10 minutes, 
and then placing them on ice for two minutes.  Then, 1ul of Genisphere’s Superase 
RNase inhibitor was added to the reactions and 8ul of Gensiphere’s cDNA synthesis 
cocktail, containing Superscript First Strand Buffer, DTT, dNTPs, and the Superscript II 
enzyme was added to each sample.  After gentle pipet mixing, the cDNA synthesis 
reaction was incubated at 42oC for 90 minutes.  Finally, 3.5ul of .5M NaOH/.5M EDTA 
was then added to each tube to stop the reaction.  The tubes were heated at 65oC for 10 
minutes to degrade the RNA template and 5ul of 1M Tris at pH seven was added to each 
tube. 

Microarray Hybridization 
Agilent’s Mouse Whole Genome Microarray was used to screen gene expression of the 
two samples.  To hybridize the samples to the array, the cDNA samples were pooled and 
an equal volume of Agilent’s 2x Hybridization Buffer was added to them.  These

hybridization solutions were then heated to 80oC for 10 minutes.  The microarray cover 
was placed in the hybridization chamber, and after the solutions cooled to room 
temperature, 110ul of the solution was pipetted onto the cover.  The microarray was then 
placed face down on top of the samples, and the hybridization chamber was closed.  The 
array was left at 60oC in a hybridization oven overnight.  The next day, the unbound 
cDNA was washed off of the array with 0.005% Triton X-100 and 6xSSC, containing 
2.4M NaCl and .24M NaCitrate, at 42° for 10 minutes.  The array was washed again with 
0.2X SSC/0.00016% Triton X-100 at room temperature for five minutes.  The slides were 
then dried and rehybridized with Genisphere’s Cy3 and Cy5 dendrimers for four hours at 
65oC. Unbound Cy3 and Cy5 were then washed off with 2X SSC/0.0016% Triton X-100 
at room temperature for five minutes and 0.2X SSC/0.00016% Triton X-100 at room 
temperature for 10 minutes.  The slide was then dried quickly with nitrogen gas and 
scanned with an Agilent scanner.

The validated siRNA sequence is from Promega and has been demonstrated to reduce 
Renilla luciferase expression.  The scrambled siRNA is from Dharmacon (siCONTROL 
Non-Targeting siRNA #2) and contains the same nucleotides as the validated siRNA 
sequence but has at least four mismatches to any mouse gene.  The first experimental 
siRNA was designed by our lab group, but was not available in the laboratory.  Instead, 
the second experimental siRNA sequence was used in the experiment. 

The Renilla luciferase gene was divided into six sections, with a different group each 
designing an siRNA for one section in the hope that at least one of the siRNAs would be 
effective.  Our group designed the siRNA construct labeled Experimental siRNA 1 (see 
Table 1), which was intended to specifically target the 469-624bp region of the mRNA 
transcript of the Renilla Luciferase gene for degradation by the RNAi pathway.  This 
particular siRNA design was chosen because several of its properties suggested that it 
was likely to specifically bind to the luciferase mRNA.  This sequence has a low melting 
temperature and free energy, suggesting that it is not likely to form secondary structure 
that could interfere with binding.  Moreover, of all candidate targets, this one had the 
fewest homologous sequences in the mouse genome, which suggested it would bind most 
specifically to the target.  Due to time restrictions, the staff designed and pre-ordered an 
experimental siRNA (Experimental siRNA 2, shown in Table 1).  This siRNA was 
designed using the same criteria as Experimental siRNA 1, though it had a different 
target.  Because this sequence had been pre-ordered, it was used throughout the rest of

the experiment.  A validated siRNA (shown in Table 1), which is known to decrease 
Renilla luciferase expression, was used so that efficacy of the experimental siRNA could 
be compared against a functional siRNA.  To ensure that differences in expression were 
not simply due to the presence of any siRNA in the cell, an siRNA with a scrambled 
version of the validated siRNA sequence that has no homology to the mouse genome was 
also used. 

Figure 1.  Experimental siRNA does not decrease light emission in cells transfected with 
Renilla luciferase 

Mouse embryonic stem cells were transfected with the Renilla and firefly luciferase-
containing psiCHECK2 plasmid only, the validated siRNA only, the plasmid and the 
validated siRNA, the plasmid and the scrambled siRNA, and the plasmid with the 
experimental siRNA.  Two days after transfection, light emission from the cell lysates 
was measured.  This experiment was performed with two replicates of each cell type, and 
the average light emitted by the two replicates is shown here.  Error bars indicate 1 
standard deviation above and below the mean value. 

In order to determine the effect of the experimental siRNA on Renilla luciferase 
expression, we transfected cells with the Renilla and firefly luciferase-containing 
psiCHECK2 plasmid only, the validated siRNA only, the plasmid and the validated 
siRNA, the plasmid and the scrambled siRNA with no homology to the mouse genome, 
and the plasmid with the experimental siRNA.  We then measured the light emitted by 
firefly and Renilla luciferases in the lysates from the transfected cells.  Because the light 
emitted by firefly luciferase is approximately constant between all samples that contained 
a plasmid, it is reasonable to make general comparisons between the samples.  The two 
types of cells that did not contain the psiCHECK2 plasmid that encoded the light-
emitting Renilla and firefly luciferase genes – one of these cell types also contains the 
validated siRNA and the other contains no additional siRNA – are negative controls, and 
as seen in Figure 1, showed practically no light emission.  The positive control cells,

which contained only the luciferase-encoding plasmid, had much higher light emission 
values.  Likewise, the cells containing the plasmid and scrambled siRNA also had high 
emission values (see Figure 1).  The experimental siRNA lysates emitted more light than 
the lysates from the cells that did not contain a plasmid, and than the lysates from the 
cells that contained the validated siRNA only.  However, the error bars of the light 
emitted by the lysates from the cells that were treated with the experimental siRNA and 
the plasmid fall within the range of the error bars of the light emitted by the lysates from 
cells that were treated with the plasmid only, and within the error bars of the light emitted 
by the lysates from the cells that were treated with the plasmid and the scrambled siRNA, 
as seen in Figure 1.

The transfected cells were visually monitored to determine how siRNA transfection 
affected growth.  All samples contained cells that were healthy and growing, though the 
cells that were transfected appeared to be slightly less dense than those that did not 
contain plasmid or siRNA, as seen in Figure 2, suggesting that the transfections led to 
decreased cell growth.

mRNA isolated from mouse embryonic stem cells transfected with only the luciferase-
containing psiCHECK2 plasmid, and mRNA isolated from cells transfected with the 
plasmid and the experimental luciferase-targeting siRNA were compared on a 
microarray.  Of the ~44,000 genes on the array, about 8,600 were differentially 
expressed between the two samples.  No genes with which the experimental siRNA has 
homology were differentially expressed, and 106 of 133 interferon genes showed no 
differential expression between the two samples. 

In order to look for off-target effects caused by the siRNA, we ran a microarray using 
cDNA reverse transcribed from mRNA from cell lysates that had been transfected with 
only the plasmid, and from cell lysates that had been treated with the plasmid and the 
experimental siRNA.  This microarray shows that about 8,600 genes were differentially 
expressed between these two samples, as shown in Table 2. It is possible that these 
effects were due to mRNA degradation in the RNAi pathway, or that slight differences in 
the cells’ environment led to these differential expression patterns.  The siRNA was 
BLASTed against the mouse genome, and none of the genes to which it has the greatest 
homology showed differential expression between these two samples.  Thus, any effects 
due to the siRNA were probably not due to specific binding.  It is also possible that the 
addition of the siRNA activated the anti-viral interferon pathway, which would result in 
differential expression between the two samples.  However, of the 133 interferon genes 
present in the microarray, 106 showed no differential expression (see table 2).  The 
remaining 27 interferon genes that showed differential expression do not appear to be 
directly related.  Thus, it appears that the experimental siRNA did result in some off-
target gene regulation.

In order to analyze the data collected from the microarray, we first accounted for 
background by subtracting the average of all median background signals over all genes 
from the signal measured from each gene.  We chose to use the median background 
signal in order to avoid strong outlier signals that would skew the mean.  For each gene, 
we then divided the signal values from the plasmid only sample by the signal values for 
the sample that had been treated with the plasmid and the experimental siRNA in order to 
obtain the fold change between their expression levels.  To view these data more easily, 
we took the log2  of the fold change for each gene (see table 3).  Thus, genes that are 
expressed more than two-fold higher in the samples that were treated with the plasmid 
only compared to the samples treated with the plasmid and the siRNA will have positive 
log2  values, and genes that are expressed more than two times higher in the samples that 
were treated with the plasmid and the siRNA compared to the samples treated only with 
the plasmid will have negative log2  values.  As can be seen in Table 3, there is no obvious

connection between the 20 genes that showed the greatest differential expression between 
the two samples; it does not appear that the experimental siRNA affected any specific 
off-target pathway.  Moreover, none of these 20 genes are known to be involved in the 
interferon pathway, further suggesting that this pathway was not activated. 

Discussion 
siRNA is often used to alter gene expression at the post-translational level.  In this 
experiment, we designed an siRNA to specifically target the Renilla luciferase gene. 
However, the variation of the light emitted by the lysate from cells transfected with both 
the experimental siRNA and the psiCHECK2 plasmid, which contains Renilla and firefly 
luciferase genes, was within the error bar of the light emitted by the lysates from cells 
transfected with the plasmid only and by the lysates from the cells transfected with the 
plasmid and the scrambled siRNA, suggesting the experimental siRNA is not able to 
reduce Renilla luciferase expression. Because of the difficulty of predicting the efficacy 
of siRNA designs this result seems reasonable; although we took many aspects of siRNA 
design into consideration, siRNA design is still not well understood, and thus there is a 
certain amount of randomness in the process. 
Ekaterina Pak and Matthew Loper performed the same experiment and reported 
data showing the same luciferase expression trends (20.109 Luciferase URL); the error 
bars of the light emitted by the lysates of cells transfected with the experimental siRNA 
and the plasmid are within the error bars for the light emitted by the lysates from the cells 
transfected with the plasmid only and the cells transfected with the plasmid only and the 
scrambled siRNA. Though the two data sets follow the same trend, the Pak and Loper 
data show much lower emission from Renilla luciferase in all samples compared to our 
data, though the firefly values are similar in both data sets.  This discrepancy could be 
due to a difference with the luciferin added to the samples to measure Renilla luciferase 
light emission.  If the luciferin Pak and Loper used was more dilute or partially degraded, 
Renilla luciferase levels would be consistently decreased, as we see here. 
The experimental siRNA’s ineffectiveness in reducing Renilla luciferase levels 
could also be due to off-target effects that resulted in decreased regulation of the target 
mRNA.  If the siRNA was used to induce RNAi of other transcripts, there would not be 
as much available to target the Renilla luciferase transcript.  The microarray showed that 
about 8,600 mRNA transcripts were differentially expressed between the cells that were 
transfected with the plasmid only and those that were transfected with the plasmid and 
the experimental siRNA.  However, the cells transfected with only the plasmid and those 
transfected with both the plasmid and the experimental siRNA showed the same level of 
expression for all mRNA transcripts to which the siRNA has the greatest homology. 
Thus, it is unlikely that the differential mRNA expression is due to specific siRNA 
binding.  Additionally, we looked at the expression patterns of interferon genes, which 
the cell uses to defend against viral invasion, since the siRNA could be perceived as viral 
genetic material by the cell.  While a few interferon genes are differentially expressed 
between the two samples, it is unclear that this pathway is activated.  Thus, it seems 
likely that the siRNA affects the regulation of off-target genes. 
However, it appears that the experimental siRNA’s off-target effects did not 
significantly affect the growth of the cells into which it was transfected.  After 
transfection, the cells were visually examined with a light microscope. Cells that had

been transfected with nucleic acids showed decreased growth compared to the cells that 
had been treated using the lipofection protocol, but to which no nucleic acids had been 
added. This decrease in growth was not more noticeable in cells transfected with the 
experimental siRNA than in any of the other transfected cells.  Thus, it seems that the 
experimental siRNA itself had no effect on cell growth. 
While this experiment has provided a wealth of information about the efficacy 
and effects of our experimental siRNA, there were also several limitations to this 
experiment that suggest future experiments to further elucidate the effects of the 
experimental siRNA.  Foremost, the microarray we used contained the entire mouse 
genome, and thus was useful for looking at off-target effects, but it did not contain the 
luciferase gene that had been transfected into the mouse cells.  As a result, it yielded no 
further information about the efficacy of the experimental siRNA.  In the future, it would 
be valuable to include the Renilla and firefly luciferase genes in the microarray in order 
to obtain a second set of quantitative data describing the effect of the siRNA on its 
intended target.  Moreover, it would be interesting to transfect cells with the plasmid and 
both the experimental and validated siRNAs to see if a combination of both siRNAs leads 
to greater Renilla luciferase depletion than either of the siRNAs by themselves. 
This experiment illustrates the difficulty of using RNAi to regulate protein 
expression in the laboratory.  Though we carefully considered the properties that are 
thought to be most important in designing an siRNA when we created the experimental 
siRNA, this siRNA cannot be considered effective and also has many off-target effects. 
This demonstrates that even our best understanding of siRNA design is not enough to 
consistently produce effective and specific siRNA.  Unless significant strides are made in 
siRNA design, it may be more useful to implement traditional gene knockdown methods, 
like homologous recombination.  Thus, while RNAi is a very useful technique in theory, 
more research must be done to increase its usefulness in practice.
