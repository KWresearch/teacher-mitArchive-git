Goals for your presentation


How can you make your proposal compelling? 
•	 Convince audience that project is worth doing 
•	 Convince audience that you can do it 

•	 Assume that your audience comprises: 
•	 experts in your topic 
•	
intelligent non-experts with exposure to your 
field

Components of the presentation


•	 brief project overview 
•	 sufficient background information for everyone to 
understand your proposal 
•	 statement of the research problem and goals 
•	 project details and methods 
•	 predicted outcomes if everything goes according to 
plan and if nothing does 
•	 needed resources to complete the work 
•	 societal impact if all goes well

Dividing up the presentation: 
general principles 
•	 Each partner should speak roughly the same 
amount of time 
•	 Audiences will assume change in speakers 
corresponds to change in topic -- don’t confuse them 
•	 Changing speakers can distract audience/slow the 
talk down -- keep shifts to a minimum 
•	 How you choose to divide the talk depends on the 
shape of your presentation -- many different options!

Dividing up the presentation: 
Option 1 (Down the Middle) 
Speaker 2: 
Speaker 1: 
•	 project details and 
•	 brief project overview 
methods 
•	 sufficient background 
information for everyone 
•	 predicted outcomes if 
to understand your 
everything goes according 
proposal 
to plan and if nothing 
does 
•	 statement of the research 
•	 needed resources to 
problem and goals 
complete the work 
•	 societal impact if all goes 
well 

division assumes that Part I 
is roughly as long as Part II

Dividing up the presentation: 
Option 3 (Back and Forth) 
Speaker 2: 
Speaker 1: 
•	 brief project overview 

each partner speaks long 
enough to establish flow 

•	 sufficient background 
information for everyone to 
understand your proposal 
•	 statement of the research 
problem and goals 

•	 project details and

methods

•	 needed resources to 
complete the work 
•	 predicted outcomes if 
everything goes according 
•	 societal impact if all goes 
to plan and if nothing 
well

More options (for specific kinds 
of projects) 

•	 Two discrete research questions OR 
•	 Two discrete methods 
•	 each partner follows one strand 
•	
introductory and concluding material each 
presented by a single partner 

•	 Other possibilities, depending on the particulars of 
your material

Help focus the audience’s 
attention on the right speaker 
•	 During overview, identify who will speak on what 
topic 
•	 Review/Preview as you proceed through the talk 
•  Articulate transitions explictly -- “hand off” 
•	 Only one partner “onstage” at a time 
•  If you’re not speaking, don’t hover nearby 
•	 Do not interrupt each other

Rehearse as a team


•	 Note timing of each section and of talk as a whole 
•	 Practice moving into speaking position at transition 
points 
•	 Will you advance each other’s 
slides? 
•	 Aim for similar speaking styles 
•	 don’t imitate each other, but

match your formality levels 

•	 Familiarize yourself with partner’s 
material 
•	 Practice Q&A

Questions to ask yourselves 
about organization 
•	 Does our talk fit together as a coherent whole? 
•	 Are all sections of the talk adequately developed? 
•	 Do we have a focused, well-defined hypothesis? 
•	
Is it clear what is going to be done and how? 
•	 Have we realistically articulated the scope of the 
work? 
•	 Have we omitted extraneous material? 
•	 Will our project fire up an audience’s interest? 
•	 What might make this proposal more convincing to a 
funding body?

Questions to ask yourselves 
about slide design 
•	 Is everything on the slide readable? 
•	 Are our slides a good balance of text and figures? 
•	 Have we chosen clear, specific titles that express 
the main point of each slide? 
•	 Is the design/format of our slides consistent, or were 
they obviously designed by different people?

Questions to ask yourselves 
about delivery 

•	 Can we get through our whole presentation in 10 
minutes? 
•	 Do we know where to position ourselves, and how to 
coordinate our shifts smoothly? 
•	 Do our speaking styles work well together? 
•	 Are we making the transitions between topics and 
speakers clear to the audience?
