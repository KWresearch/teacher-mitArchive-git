00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,770
PROFESSOR: Now a few more words
about phasor diagrams.

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:16,560
Phasor diagrams can be very
useful, but again, like

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,380
always, you have to have
a lot of practice.

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,100
And if you don't have the
practice, they may scare you

6
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,500
at first. And they may
even confuse you.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,970
I will do one problem in which
I will use phasor diagrams.

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,420
That's my last problem that
I will do-- seven--

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,990
because I will leave you
alone with eight.

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,880
I don't think eight is
all that difficult.

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:44,190
L, R, C. And we have an
alternating voltage source, E0

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,350
cosine omega t, and I think
it's called E of s.

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:01:03,140
And again, getting boring, I
keep drawing the same circuit,

14
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:10,700
C, L, R. I'm going to put
a voltmeter over here.

15
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,520
Nothing is new now.

16
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,820
We've seen this now
several times.

17
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,260
I'm going to put a voltmeter,
VL, over here, and I'm going

18
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,590
to put a voltmeter over here.

19
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,470

20
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,090
And now I also am going to put
a voltmeter over here, which

21
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,700
the authors call V out.

22
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,386
Earlier we had 1 over L
and C, you remember?

23
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:39,260
And we argued that at resonance
it always reads 0.

24
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,470
But now I put 1 over L and R.

25
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,260
Now like in the previous problem
whereby we had V4,

26
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,710
which was over L and C, we now
have to take the phase

27
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,350
difference between this voltage
and this voltage into

28
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,100
account if we evaluate
the V out.

29
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,980

30
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,560
Well, this is now
where a phasor

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,185
diagram can be very useful.

32
00:02:08,185 --> 00:02:16,060
We treat the voltages,
in a way, as vectors.

33
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,130
If the current at one particular
moment is I0, which

34
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:25,250
is the maximum value, then the
amplitude of the voltmeter

35
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,490
over the resistance will be I0
times R. And I put that here

36
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,950
as a vector.

37
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:37,850
It is true that the maximum
amplitude of the voltmeter

38
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:44,170
over the self-inductance will
read I0 times omega L, but not

39
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,560
at the same time
that this one.

40
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,270
It is ahead of this one.

41
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,390
And it is true that the
voltmeter over the

42
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:58,100
capacitance, the amplitude, will
be I0 times 1 over omega

43
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,760
C, but it will not occur
at the same time that

44
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,180
this one does it.

45
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,380
In fact, it will do
with it later.

46
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,120
It is 90 degrees behind this
voltage, and this one is 90

47
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,430
degrees behind that voltage.

48
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,440
I can now make a
factor diagram.

49
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,320
This is a vector.

50
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,110
This is a vector.

51
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,760
And this is a vector.

52
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,840
I add, first, these
two vectors up.

53
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,820

54
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:32,700
That gives me here a vector
omega L minus 1 over omega C.

55
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,820
And now I have here a vector.

56
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,640
And this vector, V, which is now
the total voltage around

57
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,310
the whole circuit, which equals
the square root of

58
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:55,520
omega L minus omega C squared
plus R squared times I, which

59
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,650
is I times Z. It's I0.

60
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,520
Because I have I0's
everywhere.

61
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,560
And here is that angle phi the
way I have defined it before.

62
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,040
Now, all these four vectors--

63
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,290
this one, this one, this
one, and this one--

64
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,620
rotate around in this direction
with angular

65
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,080
velocity omega.

66
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,220
And the actual value that the
voltmeter will read--

67
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,050
that's the way you should

68
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,940
interpret this phasor diagram--

69
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,380
is the projection of
that vector onto

70
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,290
the horizontal axis.

71
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:29,600
And so you can see when the
voltmeter of the resistor

72
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,490
reaches the maximum value, this
projection is zero and

73
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,500
this projection is zero.

74
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,570
I've stated that many
times before.

75
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,085
When this reads a maximum value,
this reads zero and

76
00:04:38,085 --> 00:04:39,080
this reads zero.

77
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,490
But now if you have a quarter of
a period later, this vector

78
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,960
will be here, this vector will
be here, and so this vector

79
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,430
will reach, this voltmeter
will reach a maximum.

80
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,640
And this vector will be here
and this voltmeter

81
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,980
will reach a maximum.

82
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:02,360
And this vector here, if you
want to know what the voltage

83
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,000
of the driver is--

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,280
because this is the voltage
of the driver--

85
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,900
well, that's at E0
cosine omega t.

86
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,220
And we call that E of S. When
that goes around, it's the

87
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,700
projection on the horizontal
that at all moments in time

88
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,290
gives you the driving EMF.

89
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,700
And this is not so easy to
digest, but once you get the

90
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,930
hang of it, it's actually
very nice.

91
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,160
Because if now you want to know
what the voltage is of

92
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:39,720
the voltmeter that is attached
to the self-inductance and the

93
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,570
resistor, all you have to take
into account is the phase

94
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:46,760
difference between this vector
and that vector.

95
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,560
And so I will make a new
diagram for that.

96
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,550

97
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:59,760
This is the vector amplitude
Ir times R. And this is the

98
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:10,850
vector, which is ahead,
amplitude I0 times omega L.

99
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:16,430
Taking the phase into account,
this will now be what the

100
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,720
voltmeter V out will read--

101
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,800
amplitude.

102
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,970
This is over the R and the L
simultaneously, which is I0

103
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:32,000
times the square root of omega
L squared plus R squared.

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,790
You see that immediately
from this diagram.

105
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,010
And this phase angle is not the
phi that we have defined

106
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,420
before, but you can determine
what it is.

107
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,940
You can take the tangent--

108
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,780
it's omega L divided by R-- if
you were interested in this.

109
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,700
So we're looking at these
voltages now as vectors.

110
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:58,370
V out zero equals V amplitude R
plus V amplitude over L. And

111
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,570
the phase differences now have
be taken into account.

112
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:09,800
And so the magnitude of the
output voltage equals I0 times

113
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,310
this square root.

114
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:17,860
And so if you want to know now
what the ratio is of V out

115
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:30,440
over Es, well, they have the
I0 in common, so you would

116
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,160
get, then, that you find here
the square root of omega

117
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,760
squared L squared plus R divided
by the square root of

118
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,680
Z. I think you will have
no difficulties

119
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,060
finding this because--

120
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,200
this is Es--

121
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,460
because E0, that's the amplitude
of the driver,

122
00:07:52,460 --> 00:08:05,720
equals I0 divided by Z. That's
the definition of Z. And so

123
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,200
this shouldn't be too hard.

124
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,990
And I think I'll leave
you alone with this.

125
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,600
Because now that you have this,
well, I think you are

126
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,270
very, very well on your way.

127
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:21,835
