1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,650

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:11,100
I want to discuss with you an
RLC circuit that is not so

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,770
conventional.

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,910
It's not a series circuit, but
it's a parallel circuit.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,840
It is trivial, it is very
pedestrian, but I hope you

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,360
will learn something
from that.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:29,210
I have here some driving
[? voltage choice ?]

8
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:35,370
e0 cosine omega t.

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:46,720
Let there be here a capacitor c,
here a self-inducted l, and

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,640
here a resistance r.

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,650
Very different from the circuits
that we have seen

12
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:56,810
before, because they're not in
series, but they are parallel.

13
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,130
I always, when I solve these
problems, take a moment that

14
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:03,100
this is plus and that this
is minus, and I make the

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,140
assumption that there
are no charges

16
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,240
anywhere on the capacitor.

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,430
This is always correct, because
my sign convention

18
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,210
comes always out OK.

19
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,730
That means this side of the
capacitor will then be charged

20
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,090
positive, and I get
an e field in the

21
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:18,180
capacitors in this direction.

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,780
The e field in the
[? voltage choice ?]

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,080
goes from plus to minus.

24
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,340
So it goes in this direction.

25
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,490
There is no e field here, and
there is an e field in the

26
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,000
resistor, in this direction.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,700
There is a total current going
like this, and the total

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,330
current will split into one
current that will go through

29
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,380
the capacitor, one current
that goes through the

30
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,490
self-inductor, and
one current that

31
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,200
goes through the resistor.

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,150
So at any moment in time, the
total current at any moment in

33
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:55,940
time, must be ic plus
il plus ir.

34
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,450
At any moment in time.

35
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,960
So I put a little t here, a
little t here, a little t

36
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,540
here, a little t here.

37
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,220
I assume that no charge can
pile up at any of these

38
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:09,610
intersections, so therefore the
total current that flows

39
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:14,120
in here must be the total
current that flows out here

40
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,510
into some of the
three currents.

41
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,160
I will only solve for steady
state solutions, and so I

42
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,370
immediately turned to Faraday's
Law, the closed loop

43
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:29,460
integral of e dot dl, and I
do that for three loops.

44
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,790
Now follow me closely.

45
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,680
I'm first going to
do it clockwise.

46
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,630
In this loop, I call that
loop number one.

47
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,440
Then I'm going to do it
clockwise in this loop.

48
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,580
I call that number two.

49
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,990
And then I'm going to do it
clockwise in this loop.

50
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:50,430
I call that number three.

51
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,270
And for number one and
for number three,

52
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,110
Kirchoff's Law holds.

53
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,300
It is a non-conservative e
field, so this equals 0.

54
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,770
But for loop number two,
Kirchoff's Law does not hold.

55
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,330
We have a non-conservative
e field And the answer

56
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,650
is minus l dil dt.

57
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,230

58
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:20,770
So I can write down now, if I
want to, the differential

59
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,910
equations for these
three loops.

60
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,760
I start here.

61
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,030
I go up against the
electric field.

62
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:31,920
So I got minus e0
cosine omega t.

63
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,040
This is for loop one.

64
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,480
Then I go across the capacitor,
so I get the charge

65
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,310
on the capacitor divided by c.

66
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,120
That's the integral of
e dot dl to this gap.

67
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,790
And that must be 0.

68
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,750
And I keep in mind that
dqcdt is the current

69
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,980
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] capacitor.

70
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:57,800
For loop number two, I have
minus e0 cosine omega t.

71
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,620
When I go through here, when I
go through the self-inductor,

72
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,470
there is no electric field, so
that component equals 0.

73
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:07,770
I close the loop, and Faraday's
Law tells me that

74
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:11,260
that is l dil dt.

75
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,370
So I can change these minus
signs into plus signs.

76
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,360
And then for loop number three,
I get minus e0 cosine

77
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:25,840
omega t plus ir times
r equals 0.

78
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,970
That is again, if you want to
call it, Kiechoff's Law.

79
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,950
And the total current at any
moment in time is the sum of

80
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,110
the individual ones.

81
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,150
This is total plus il plus ir.

82
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,660
And that must be i0 cosine
omega t minus

83
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,750
some phase angle phi.

84
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,790
And this holds for any
moment in time.

85
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,440

86
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,820
Namely for this moment
in time.

87
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,150
If you want to, you
can replace all

88
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,900
these things by currents.

89
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,010
In this case, it's easy.

90
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,100
You take the first derivative
of this equation, and so you

91
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,710
find the current through the
capacitor at any moment in

92
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:17,000
time, which is qdt, which would
become minus c e0 omega

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,230
sine omega t.

94
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,190
The current, through its
self-inductor, at any moment

95
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:27,020
in time, would become e0 divided
by omega times the

96
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,770
sine omega t.

97
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,550
If you execute this integral,
you will immediately see that.

98
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,940
It's true that there could
be some constant here,

99
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,660
integration constant, but that
would be a DC components, and

100
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,500
that would certainly
not be valid here.

101
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,600
Then we have the current through
the resistor at any

102
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,330
moment in time equals e0 cosine
omega t divided by r.

103
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,300
So what do we have here now?

104
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:01,920
We have a minus sine omega t,
we have a plus sine omega t,

105
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,160
and we have a cosine omega t.

106
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,050
And so that's telling you that
there are phase lags between

107
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,580
these three currents.

108
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,620
If I try to be a little bit
pedestrian, almost high

109
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:21,240
school-like, but we have time
for that, and I, without

110
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:28,120
wanting to insult you, I draw
here a cosine term.

111
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,480
So this is the driving voltage,
the cosine term.

112
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,010
And if I draw here
a sine term--

113
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:41,260

114
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,360
this is a plus sine term.

115
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,580
And the plus sine term holds
for the self- inductor.

116
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,110
So I put a self-inductor
here, which is

117
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,040
my shorthand notation.

118
00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:04,150
And if I put in minus sine omega
t, minus the sine, which

119
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:07,590
is the one that holds for the
capacitor, then you see

120
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,470
immediately, when you look at
this point and this point,

121
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,695
that the current in the
capacitor is 90 degrees ahead

122
00:07:14,695 --> 00:07:17,030
of the voltage, which
is nothing new.

123
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,740
And you see here that the
voltage driver is 90 degrees

124
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,830
ahead of the current in
the self-inductor.

125
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,410
The current in the self-inductor
is lagging.

126
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,100
We have mentioned that before,
because the self-inductor has

127
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,830
the ability to quiet
down the current.

128
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,800
It doesn't like the current
to come up.

129
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,980
So the current will
be lagging.

130
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,070
And you see that very clearly
in these curves, and you see

131
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,410
that very clearly in the minus
sign omega t, the plus sign

132
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:46,170
omega t, and the
cosine omega t.

133
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,450
And therefore, this problem
is screaming

134
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:54,185
for a phasor diagram.

135
00:07:54,185 --> 00:07:59,490
A phasor diagrams will tell
me all the answers.

136
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:06,025
I have here a vector
at i, 0, 4.

137
00:08:06,025 --> 00:08:11,120
This is the amplitude of the
current, which equals e 0

138
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,040
divided by r.

139
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,680
This one rotates around with
angular velocity omega.

140
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,290
At this moment, it has
a positive value.

141
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,780
When it is here, a quarter of
an oscillation later, the

142
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,810
projection on this axis is 0,
and there's no current going

143
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,960
through a resistor.

144
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,550
When it is here, the current is
going through the resistor,

145
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,940
but in the opposite direction.

146
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,030
When it is here, there is no
current going through the

147
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,260
resistor, and when it is here,
it's going through the

148
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,450
resistor again in the
same direction.

149
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,630
So the current through the
resistor, which is no

150
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:43,630
surprise, is oscillating back
and forth, and there are

151
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,450
moments that it is 0.

152
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,450
Now I put here in the vector the
current, amplitude current

153
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:56,330
for the capacitor, which
is e 0 omega c.

154
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:02,490
You can see that immediately
from my previous text, if I

155
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,310
can find my previous text--

156
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,840

157
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,000
oh, it's somewhere on the floor,
so I can't find it.

158
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,170
But if you go back, you will see
that is the amplitude of

159
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:17,430
the current when I derived
the current from the

160
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,860
differential equations.

161
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,900
And of course, this one also
goes around with angular

162
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,170
velocity omega.

163
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,420
At this moment in time, the
projection is 0, but when it's

164
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,160
here, it is maximum in one
direction, and when it's here,

165
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,010
it is a maximum in the
other direction.

166
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:37,810
And i0 going through the
self-inductor equals e0

167
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:41,010
divided by omega l, which
follows from what I just did

168
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,430
only minutes ago.

169
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,560
And this also goes around with
angular velocity omega.

170
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,330
And this whole system,
these three spikes

171
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,600
together are couples.

172
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,770
They all go around with angular
velocity omega.

173
00:09:54,770 --> 00:10:01,170
So if I add this one to this
one, I get here a vector e0

174
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,940
times omega c minus
1 divided omega l.

175
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,670
And so the net vector, adding
all these three currents

176
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,410
together, and that's
what I have to do.

177
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:15,970
Because in this case, the
currents through the system is

178
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,660
the sum of these
three currents.

179
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,330
And I add them now, so to speak,
in a vectorial sense,

180
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:28,910
Then this current, i0, which
is the amplitude, equals e0

181
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:34,930
times the square root of omega
c1 over omega l squared plus 1

182
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,160
over r squared.

183
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,010
Be careful!

184
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,040
This may look similar to the one
you have seen in a series,

185
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,550
but it is very different.

186
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,730
And the angle of phi, the way
we define that follows

187
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,640
immediately, also from
this phasor diagram.

188
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:59,620
The tangent of phi equals omega
c minus 1 over omega l

189
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,230
divided by r.

190
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,750
And of course, you can clean
that up a little

191
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,880
bit, if you want to.

192
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:14,480
And i0 itself, within the
e0 times this monster.

193
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,250
and since e0, per definition,
equals i0 times the cell

194
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,790
impedance, the cells impede
in v equals 1

195
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,960
divided by this monster.

196
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:35,610
Now comes the question,
when is i0 a maximum?

197
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,700
What I'm trying to drive at is,
either perhaps residences,

198
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,290
like we have in an
RLC circuit.

199
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,160
Well, look at this result.

200
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,650
When is i0 a maximum, it's
immediately clear

201
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,650
when r equals 0.

202
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,294
Because then this term
goes to infinity.

203
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,220
Well, that is immediately
obvious!

204
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,630
We didn't have to do such fancy
differential equations.

205
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,630
If r is 0, you short circuit
this battery.

206
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,600
And if this battery has no
internal resistance, of course

207
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,290
you get an infinite current.

208
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,740
So that's totally trivial.

209
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,250
That's something that you could

210
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:14,240
have immediately predicted.

211
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,530
So now, let's assume
that r is fixed.

212
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:23,090
Where, now, is i0 maximum?

213
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:29,260
Well, now i0 is maximum when
omega c minus 1 over omega l

214
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:33,310
squared is a maximum.

215
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,710
Because you see here, in the
phasor diagrams, you see here

216
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,550
this term, and you
see this term.

217
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:45,850
So when this is a maximum, you
expect i0 to be a maximum.

218
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,040
When will that be?

219
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,450
Well, it will be the case
when il equals 0 and

220
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,380
when c equals infinity.

221
00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:00,540
So when l equals 0, i0
becomes infinity.

222
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:07,510
And when c goes to infinity,
then also i0 goes to infinity.

223
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,440
Is that obvious?

224
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,520
Of course that's obvious!

225
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,830
If I have l0, then this
is just a solid bar.

226
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,500
It has no self-inductance,
it has no resistance.

227
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,390
So I'm short-circuiting
the system.

228
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:23,490
So I get an infinite current
going if this

229
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,240
[? voltage choice ?]

230
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,390
has no internal resistance.

231
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,910
What happens if c is
infinitely high?

232
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,870
That's also a short circuit.

233
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,680
Because infinitely high c is
like a lake that is so large

234
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,880
in area that when you put water
in it, that it can take

235
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,300
infinite amounts of water, but
the water level doesn't rise.

236
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,260
Or to talk in more electric
terms, the capacitor can take

237
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:53,850
on any amount of charge, but the
integral e dot dl, across

238
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,360
the gap, and you may want
to call that the voltage

239
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,830
overcapacitor, will
then not change.

240
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,360
So that, effectively, is also
a short circuit here.

241
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,640
It can take an infinite
amount of charge.

242
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,890
And so this current that will
flow through here is then also

243
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,040
infinitive.

244
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,340
So all these wonderful
differential equations leads

245
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,180
us only to totally trivial
answers we could've predicted

246
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,250
without any differential
equations.

247
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:28,000
But now suppose that r, l, and
c are all three fixed.

248
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,300
And now I want to ask you to
question, is there a value for

249
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,590
omega for which i0
is a maximum?

250
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,915
Because I'm still interested to
see whether somehow there

251
00:14:37,915 --> 00:14:40,520
is a resonance in this system.

252
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,920
Well, that would be the case
when omega c minus omega l

253
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,240
squared is a maximum.

254
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,580
Because again, I go back
to my phasor diagram.

255
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,560
r is a given.

256
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,090
I can't change that.

257
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,210
l and c are givens.

258
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,300
I can't change that.

259
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,830
But I can manipulate, I can
massage omega, to see whether

260
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,370
I can make this a maximum.

261
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:08,150
So some of you may be very
clever, and you may say, aha,

262
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:13,550
I take the derivative of this,
and I make it equal to 0, and

263
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,400
of course I will find the
maximum value, no doubt.

264
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,120
Well, why don't you do that.

265
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,480
Let's do that together.

266
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,460
We get 2 omega c minus
1 over omega l.

267
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:30,150
I use the chain rule, then I get
here a c, and then I get

268
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:35,380
here a plus 1 over l omega
squared, and that must be 0.

269
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,470
I lose the 2, and I
multiply this out.

270
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:48,600
So I get omega c squared plus c
divided by omega l, minus c

271
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,975
divided by omega l minus 1
divided by l squared omega to

272
00:15:53,975 --> 00:15:57,380
the third, and that is 0.

273
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,820
And these two cancel out,
and what do I find?

274
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:08,220
I find that omega equals 1 over
the square root of l c,

275
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,350
if you solve this equation.

276
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,720
And I say, aha!

277
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,530
There is a resonance.

278
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,970
But if I say that, I'm wrong.

279
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:25,140
Because this is not a maximum,
but it is a minimum.

280
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,390
If you take the derivative of
that function as a function of

281
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:32,840
time, and you make it equal to
0, you have a chance to find a

282
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,130
maximum, and you have a chance
to find a minimum.

283
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,450
And it is immediately obvious
that this is the minimum.

284
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,410
Because look at this equation.

285
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:45,640
When omega equals the square
root of 1 over lc, this term

286
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,260
has become 0.

287
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:54,940
Well, that means that this arrow
will always be shorter--

288
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,340
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

289
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,680
put it this way.

290
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,190
This arrow, which is the one I
have left if this is 0, is

291
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:03,430
only shorter than if
this is not 0.

292
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,220
Any value that I have in
this vector that is

293
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,460
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

294
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,050
0 will make the current
larger.

295
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,430
So the current will be a minimum
when this one is 0,

296
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:18,100
and I only have simply i0
through r is e 0 through r.

297
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,790
So you can look at the phasor
diagram, and convince yourself

298
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,174
that when this is 0,
you actually have

299
00:17:24,174 --> 00:17:27,860
a minimum in current.

300
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,040
There is no resonance.

301
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:38,840
And if you now were to make a
plot of i0 as a function of

302
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,350
omega, it will be very boring.

303
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:45,730
When omega goes to 0, the
current goes to infinity.

304
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:55,790
And the reason why the current
goes to infinity is, when

305
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,580
omega goes to 0, this value
goes to infinity.

306
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,960
So it is the l that
is doing it.

307
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,290
And then it goes through a
minimum, and then again, it

308
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,210
goes to infinity, and that is
the c that is doing it,

309
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,430
because when omega goes to
infinity, this value goes to

310
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:17,150
infinity, and so the current
goes to infinity.

311
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,470
And then there is here
this minimum.

312
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,580
And this minimum is as
e0 divided by r.

313
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,440
And this minimum is when
omega equals 1 over the

314
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,900
square root of lc.

315
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,960
So you've seen the
whole thing now.

316
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,830
This is a parallel circuit.

317
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,760
Behaves very differently.

318
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,110
But still, it's good to do
this kind of an exercise.

319
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,970
It builds up some confidence
in how you deal with phasor

320
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,870
diagrams, how you deal with
differential equations, and

321
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,900
more important for me, how you
get totally trivial answers

322
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,190
that you could have
predicted anyhow.
