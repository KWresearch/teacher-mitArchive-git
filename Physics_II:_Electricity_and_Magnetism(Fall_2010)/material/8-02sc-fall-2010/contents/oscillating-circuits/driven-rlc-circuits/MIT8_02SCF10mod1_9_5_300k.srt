1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,690

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,340
Again, an RMC circuit.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,700

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,100
I have an L, I have a R, I have
a C, and I have an E0

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,570
cosine omega t.

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:26,560
This is 110 ohms and you're
being told that the impedance

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,660
is 150 ohms.

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,340
Are you're being asked, what
is the mean power that is

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,750
delivered to the circuit?

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,690
I have to say mean because I
have to average it over one

11
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,240
complete cycle, one period
of oscillations.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,550
Because as you will see, the
power delivered to the

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:47,890
circuits is not constant.

14
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:48,880
It oscillates.

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,570
I think it oscillates with omega
squared, some kind of

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,440
sine squared, omega squared, but
you figure that one out.

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:03,090
In any case, the mean value
equals the voltage rms times

18
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,300
the current rms times the cosine
of that angle phi the

19
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,990
way I defined that before.

20
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,170
And I will refer you to equation
32-30 without any

21
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,430
further elaborating
on why this is so.

22
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:23,660
Now, Vrms is obviously Irms
times Z for the simple reason

23
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:34,250
that V 0 equals I0 times Z.
That's the way it is defined.

24
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:40,680
This V0, by the way,
is that E0.

25
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,210
And the tangent of phi, which we
have mentioned many times,

26
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:55,210
is omega L minus 1 over
omega C divided by R.

27
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,630
So you shouldn't have any
difficulties calculating these

28
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:04,280
values because you know the
Vrms, that is, the V0 divided

29
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,350
by the square root of 2.

30
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,940
You know V0.

31
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:12,890
And you know Z. And so you can
clearly calculate Irms, so you

32
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,700
know this one.

33
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,390
So you're almost there
as long as you can

34
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,390
calculate cosine of phi.

35
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,080
How can I convert this
into a cosine?

36
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,495
Well, that's a trick
that I already

37
00:02:22,495 --> 00:02:26,780
learned in high school.

38
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:40,350
I have here a triangle whereby
this angle equals phi.

39
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:45,510
And I know that this is omega L
minus 1 over omega C. And I

40
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,650
know that this is R because the
tangent of phi is exactly

41
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,320
what we gave before.

42
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,280
That means this here must be
the square root of omega L

43
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,590
minus omega C squared
plus R squared.

44
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,650
But that is exactly Z.

45
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,390
And so the cosine of phi equals
nothing but R over Z.

46
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,860
Since C was given, and since R
was given, you can find the

47
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,000
cosine of phi, which
I believe is 0.73.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,810
So it's very easy to go
from tangent of phi

49
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,970
to cosine of phi.
