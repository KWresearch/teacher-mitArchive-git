1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,550

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,760
And so this brings us now
to problem number

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,040
six, which is 32-25.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,670
Believe it or not, again, we
have an R, we have an L, we

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,770
have a C, and we have an
E0 cosine omega t.

6
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:26,930
We know E0, we know C, we
know L, and we know R.

7
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:32,700
And we had told that this
is at resonance.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,230
That means I know immediately
that omega equals omega 0.

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,540
At resonance, 1 over omega C
equals omega L. That's when

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,330
the current reaches a maximum.

11
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,930
In this case, they're
both 600 ohm.

12
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,820
They better be the same, because
they're 180 degrees

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,920
out of phase when you measure
the voltage over the self

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,190
inductor and the capacitor.

15
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,310
That's why they cancel.

16
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:03,060
R equals 400 ohms.
Phi equals 0.

17
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:10,220
And Z equals R. That's very
characteristic for resonance.

18
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,200
It's almost as if there
were no self

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,170
inductance and capacitor.

20
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,290
They completely, at any
moment in time, cancel

21
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,750
each other's effect.

22
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,490
This one would want
the voltage to be

23
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,800
ahead of the current.

24
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,040
This one wants the voltage
to be behind the

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,030
current by 90 degrees.

26
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,830
They each are equally strong, so
to speak, and so the whole

27
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,490
thing cancels out.

28
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,950
And that's why you get such
a very simple result.

29
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,510
Now, you're being asked what the
voltmeters over each one

30
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:46,790
of these would read if you
attach them and if they were

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,920
to read only rms values.

32
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,600
That means no phase
information.

33
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,640
All the phase information is
lost. The voltmeter over the

34
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,900
self inductor would read
undoubtedly I0 divided by the

35
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,430
square root of 2-- because
that's the root mean square of

36
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,430
the current--

37
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,880
times omega 0L.

38
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,310
The voltmeter over the
capacitance rms would read I0

39
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:16,400
divided by the square root of
2 times 1 over omega 0 C.

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,460
And since omega 0L and omega 0C
is exactly the same value

41
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,960
because we are at resonance--

42
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,060
omega 0 equals 1 over the
square root of LC--

43
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:34,370
this voltage is exactly the same
as this voltage, whatever

44
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,120
the answer may be.

45
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,070
They are the same.

46
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:43,200
But they are 180 degrees out of
phase, and that you will no

47
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,770
longer see when you read
these voltmeters.

48
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,670
Keep that in mind.

49
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,790
The authors are not so stupid.

50
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,740
They want you to think
a little bit harder.

51
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:04,970
There is here an L and there is
here a C. Circuit goes on.

52
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,180
So here is that VL.

53
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,010
And here is that VC--

54
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,630
voltmeters.

55
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:15,270
And they also have a voltmeter
here, which they call V4.

56
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,920

57
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,420
It's true that since the phase
information is lost, this

58
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,320
value will read the same
value as that value.

59
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,040
But since they are 180%
degrees out of phase,

60
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,310
V4 will read 0.

61
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,070
Because at any moment in time
the voltages here and here

62
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,300
will exactly cancel
each other.

63
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,390
So that is something that I
want you to keep in mind.
