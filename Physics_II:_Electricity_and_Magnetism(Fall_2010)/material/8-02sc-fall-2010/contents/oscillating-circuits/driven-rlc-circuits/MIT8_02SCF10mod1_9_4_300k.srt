00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,520

00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,565
PROFESSOR LEWIN: Problem number
four, which is 32-19.

3
00:00:11,565 --> 00:00:17,530
I have an R, I have an L, I
have a C, I have E zero

4
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,470
cosine omega t.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,600

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:31,110
300 Ohms, 0.25 Henry, 8 times 10
to the minus 6 Farads, 120

7
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,550
volts, 400 radians per second.

8
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,690
Forget the transients, we'll
only look at the

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,490
steady state solution.

10
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:45,820
I equals I zero cosine
omega t minus phi.

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,330
And the tangent of phi equals
omega L minus 1 over omega C

12
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,450
divided by R. I think it's
the third time that

13
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,180
you see this now.

14
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,990
It's interesting to write down
the reactance of the three

15
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,520
components.

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,755
It's 312 Ohms for the capacitor,
it's 100 Ohms for

17
00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:13,070
the self inductance, and it is
300 Ohms for the resistor.

18
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:19,820
And so since Z equals the square
root of omega L minus

19
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,720
omega C squared, plus R squared,
you can immediately

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,900
calculate that this is 367 Ohms.
And since I zero equals

21
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,800
E zero divided by Z,
you'll find that

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,430
this is 0.327 Amperes.

23
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:44,930
And you find that phi
is minus 35 degrees.

24
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,890
So the current is ahead of
the driving voltage.

25
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,700
Because if phi is negative, then
minus phi is positive, so

26
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,820
the current is ahead of
the driving voltage.

27
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,860
That should not surprise you.

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:03,510
Because the capacitor is more
potent than the self inductor.

29
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:09,310
If the self inductor was more
potent, it would have the

30
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:12,700
capability of delaying
the current.

31
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,240
But if the capacitor
is in charge, it

32
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,900
puts the current ahead.

33
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,190
And that's exactly what you will
see, the current is ahead

34
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,470
of the driving voltage.

35
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:30,110
If we now put volt meters over
the R, C, and the L. Then,

36
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,160
you're being told that those
volt meters, V R, as I have

37
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,400
drawn them before, V C and V L,
there's no sense in drawing

38
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:39,900
them again.

39
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,560
They are volt meters.

40
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,310
That they now only
show amplitudes.

41
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:54,220
So all phase information is
lost. You don't see them shake

42
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,650
back and forth with
frequency omega.

43
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,830
There is no phase information.

44
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,710
All they will indicate
is the amplitude.

45
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:07,790

46
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,680
If they could show the
instantaneous values, V at any

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:19,790
moment in time, then you would
see, when V R is a maximum,

48
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,130
and I repeat myself, because
I've said it before, then V L

49
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,190
would be zero, and then
V of C would be zero.

50
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,080
The volt meter over
the capacitor.

51
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,120
And when V R was zero, that
means when I is zero, V L

52
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,170
would read a maximum value, and
so would V C also read a

53
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,550
maximum value.

54
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,830
Even though these two would be
180 degrees out of phase.

55
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,600
All that is lost here.

56
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,820
These volt meter are designed
in such a way that all they

57
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,600
record are amplitudes.

58
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,560
So the amplitude of the volt
meter over the capacitor

59
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,990
equals I zero times the
reactance off the capacitor.

60
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,170
The volt meter over to resistor
would read I zero

61
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,720
times R. And the amplitude of
the volt meter over the self

62
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,290
inductance would read I
zero times omega L.

63
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:25,080
Again, I repeat myself, at the
risk of boring you, that these

64
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,460
values do not occur
simultaneously.

65
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,730

66
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:35,820
It is more common when we deal
with alternating currents, to

67
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,190
have volt meters that express
not the amplitude of the

68
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,600
voltage, but the root
mean squared.

69
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,720
Which is simply the amplitude
divided by the

70
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,460
square root of two.

71
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,400
There's nothing very
sacred about that.

72
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,505
So if you wanted, in this
particular problem, to covert

73
00:04:51,505 --> 00:04:55,860
the values to RMS values, all
you would have to do is divide

74
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,840
them by the square
root of two.

75
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,830
And there's nothing more
to it than that.

76
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:01,835
