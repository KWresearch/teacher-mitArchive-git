1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,140

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:14,530
Problem number three is 32-58.

3
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,260
It is an R L C circuit.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:23,610
The L value is 1.0 times 10
to the minus 6 henry.

5
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:29,150
We don't know C, we don't know
R, but they are in series.

6
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:36,130
It is an FM radio, and I tune
in on a broadcast--

7
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,750
I do that by varying
the capacitor.

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,800
This arrow through C means
that the capacitor can be

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,890
varied, and I have broadcast
station number one, which

10
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,340
broadcasts at an angular
frequency of 6.00 times 10 to

11
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,320
the eighth radians per second.

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,810
I tune dead onto this one.

13
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:03,100
There is an annoying nearby
station which radiates at a

14
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,380
frequency almost the same as
this one, but I don't want to

15
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,980
hear this one.

16
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:14,180
Let's first calculate what the
value for C is-- if I tune

17
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:19,160
exactly in with my variable
capacitor on this frequency,

18
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:25,650
then omega 1 must be omega 0,
and omega 0 is 1 over square

19
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,090
root of L C, as we have
seen many times for a

20
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,425
series R L C circuit.

21
00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:33,050

22
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,220
You'll find that C--

23
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,850
I square this--

24
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:43,070
equals L 1 divided by
L omega 1 squared.

25
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:47,030
I know what omega 1 is, I know
what L is, and I found--

26
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,720
I could have made a mistake--

27
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,400
2.778 times 10 to the minus
12 [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

28
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:58,690
I know how I should tune C in
order to receive omega 1 at

29
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,840
its resonance frequency.

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:11,040
Now we're also told that the
mean power that's coming from

31
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,780
the second station delivers to
the resistor R, which is

32
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,230
presumably the loudspeaker.

33
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,490
From station number one, that is
one hundredths of the mean

34
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:30,020
power through a complete cycle
of station number 1.

35
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,600
The question now
is, what is R?

36
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,180

37
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,730
I'll put this here, because
I may need this again.

38
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:45,650
Let us remind you of what the
maximum current I looks as a

39
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:51,260
function of omega for a
given R L C circuit.

40
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,035
At the beginning, this is more
or less linear, it flares up,

41
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:59,620
and we call that resonance,
and then it dies off.

42
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,020
Right here, at the maximum value
for I 0, which is the

43
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,840
resonance frequency, omega 0
equals omega 1, because that's

44
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,240
the way I have tuned
the system.

45
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,890
My second frequency comes in
here, and so you see that the

46
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,800
current is highly reduced--

47
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,260
reduced so to the point that
the power is only one

48
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,270
hundredths that the resistor
receives from

49
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,780
station number 1.

50
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,640
What is mean power in general?

51
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,230
It is the v r m s, coming in
through the antenna, times the

52
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,230
I r m s driven in the circuit,
times the cosine of phi.

53
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:47,120
This is the general equation
for power delivered to that

54
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,370
resistance r, and you have
seen this before.

55
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:57,360
The current that is going to
flow into the system equals I

56
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,722
cosine omega t minus phi.

57
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:05,260
This is something you have seen
before, and it is only to

58
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,555
refresh your memory.

59
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:09,220

60
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:14,650
The way that you can best solve
this is in the following

61
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:24,900
way: let me first calculate
the value for phi.

62
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,300
The value for phi is given as
follows: this is r, this is

63
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:37,440
omega L minus 1 over omega C.
We got this from phasor

64
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,380
diagrams, and we call
this the impedence--

65
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,850
which is omega L minus
1 over omega C

66
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:46,550
squared plus r squared.

67
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,350

68
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:55,250
The tangent of phi equals omega
L minus 1 over omega C

69
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:02,400
divided by r, and so the cosine
of phi equals R divided

70
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,400
by z, which is this
whole square root.

71
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,540
We have assumed nos--

72
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,810
I will assume--

73
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,360
that the input voltage r
m s from both stations

74
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,800
is exactly the same.

75
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,360
Now, how about the
power ratios?

76
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:35,810
The power ratio of 1 over 2 mean
values would be I r m s

77
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:43,730
circuit 1 cosine phi 1 divided
by I r m s circuit 2-- not

78
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,820
circuit 2, station 2--

79
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,840
times cosine phi 2.

80
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,910
Remember, the values for
R L C are values that

81
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:53,770
are going to be given.

82
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,030
In fact, you have to
calculate R now.

83
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:02,350
This value now we
want to be 100.

84
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,160
At resonance, cosine phi
1 equals 1, because

85
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,820
phi 1 equals 0--

86
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,250
you can immediately
see that here.

87
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,110

88
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,670
Let's write down
what I r m s--

89
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,850
I don't know what problem
I have with this sheet--

90
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:22,520

91
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,560
is in general for an
R L C circuit.

92
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,400
It is I 0 divided by the square
root of 2, and that

93
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,830
would be v 0 divided by the
square root of 2 times that

94
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:43,110
value for C. Let me write that
in-- omega L minus 1 over

95
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,300
omega C squared plus r squared,
and you have seen

96
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,170
this many times before.

97
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:53,810
If I go to station number 1, I
get that I r m s for station

98
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,850
number one equals simply
v 0 times the square

99
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,340
root of 2 times r.

100
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,820
When this is zero at resonance,
I only have an R

101
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:07,910
here, and cosine phi equals 1.

102
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,210
If I now go to station
number 2--

103
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:16,380
I r m s for station number 2
equals v 0, and we've assumed

104
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,240
that the v zeroes are the same,
the square root of 2.

105
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:29,520
Now, I get the square root,
which is now omega 2 L minus 1

106
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:37,310
over omega 2 C squared
plus R squared.

107
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,580
I also must multiply by the
cosine of phi, and the cosine

108
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:48,250
of phi equals R divided by that
same square root, so the

109
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:52,850
same square root for
occurs twice.

110
00:07:52,850 --> 00:08:03,460
Now my task is to calculate the
ratio: P 1 divided by P 2,

111
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,380
which is 100.

112
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:12,420
I take the ratios of these two
values, because the v r m s

113
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,290
here is exactly the same
as the v r m s here.

114
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,840
When I take the ratio of the
power, I can delete the v r m

115
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,220
s's, and I can also delete
the square roots of 2.

116
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:32,805
I get upstairs 1 over R, and
I get downstairs R over the

117
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:36,190
square root of this, times
the square root of this.

118
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,780

119
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,520
Maybe I'm going a little
bit too far--

120
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:46,180
I could've left you now solving
this equation, but we

121
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,272
have plenty of time,
so why not?

122
00:08:48,272 --> 00:08:56,050
It is omega 2 L minus omega
2 C squared plus R squared

123
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,720
divided by R squared.

124
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,910
That is now the requirement for
the power ratio to be 100.

125
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:08,910
C was 2.778 times 10 to the
minus 12 and L was 10 to the

126
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:19,590
minus 6, so that gives omega 2
L equals 599.0, and it gives

127
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:26,090
me 1 over omega 2
C equals 601.0.

128
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:31,800
This here is 2, so 2 squared
is 4, and so I got 4 plus R

129
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,260
squared divided by R squared,
and that equals 100.

130
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:43,280
When I solve that equation, I
found that R is approximately

131
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:48,210
0.21 ohms.

132
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,750
With this resistor, you will get
a hundred times less power

133
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:57,060
from station number 2 than you
get from station number 1, and

134
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,900
you have exactly tuned your
radio or television station,

135
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,610
for that matter, on station
number one.

136
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,570
With television, the frequencies
will be different.

137
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:07,820
