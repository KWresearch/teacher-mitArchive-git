00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,500
PROFESSOR LEWIN: Let's now turn
to a situation where by

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,140
we drive the circuit with
an alternating current.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:19,590
The emf equals E zero times
cosine omega t.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,530
Now there is an extremely
important difference between

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,080
the two cases.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,960
In the first case, the omega,
that means the oscillating

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,970
frequency of the current, was
entirely dictated by R, L and

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:41,360
C. It imposed on the circuit
it's will so to speak.

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,230
Well, if we give this
alternating current sufficient

11
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,770
amount of time, so that all of
the transient phenomenon have

12
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,170
died out, so that the system
cannot impose, any more it's

13
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:58,280
own idiosyncrasies, it's own
frequencies onto the system,

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,920
ultimately what will prevail,
and what must prevail is the

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,970
frequency of the driver.

16
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,390
So the system must, when all
transient phenomenon have died

17
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,840
out, it must start
to oscillate at

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,190
the frequency omega.

19
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:18,860
Suppose I take you by the
shoulders, and I start to

20
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,660
oscillate you at some
moment in time

21
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,170
with a certain frequency.

22
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,710
In the beginning, your system
will respond in a sort of

23
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:29,770
erratic way, having it's own
sense of the frequency at

24
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:31,640
which it wants to oscillate.

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,450
But that will ultimately die
out, and ultimately you will

26
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:40,030
have to follow my frequency with
which I am shaking you.

27
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,250
The transience will die out and
my frequency will prevail.

28
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,790
And that's exactly the
same case here.

29
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,770
So the current that will start
to flow equals I zero times

30
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,370
cosine omega t minus phi, we'll
get back to this phi,

31
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,230
and this omega is exactly
the same as this omega.

32
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:08,660
And it's completely independent
or R, L and C.

33
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,680
I zero, which can be derived, if
you solve the differential

34
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,875
equation, is a little
bit clumsy.

35
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,830

36
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:26,760
Omega L minus omega C squared
plus R squared.

37
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:37,580
And we called this also, Z. This
thing is also called Z.

38
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:42,070
This value of I zero, reaches
a maximum value,

39
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,975
when we have resonance.

40
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:47,050

41
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,640
Given a value for E zero, if I
change the frequency of the

42
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,410
driving voltage, I get a maximum
when this equals zero.

43
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:03,080
And that's the case when omega
square equals 1 over omega L

44
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,630
and we call that omega
zero squared.

45
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:12,190
As I mentioned before,
just a name.

46
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,350
The tangent of phi and phi
indicates to face difference

47
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:22,790
between the current and
the driving voltage.

48
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,170
When phi equals positive,
because there's a minus sign

49
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,240
here, the current is behind
the driving voltage.

50
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,010
When phi equals negative, the
current is ahead of the

51
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,450
driving voltage.

52
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:42,320
This equals omega L minus omega
C divided by R. And I

53
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,570
will get back to this.

54
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,180

55
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,510
If I make a plot of I zero as
a function of omega, then

56
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,590
you'll see that it always
speaks at omega

57
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,840
equals omega zero.

58
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,110

59
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,480
So this is now only I zero,
it's the maximum current,

60
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,875
which I plot as a functional
of omega.

61
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:11,320
And I keep E zero constant.

62
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,300
At the valley of omega, which
is 1 over the square root of

63
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:22,024
LC, there's no R in here,
I reach a maximum.

64
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:25,560

65
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:33,390
And this maximum, as follows
immediately from our solution,

66
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,400
this is zero.

67
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,800
It simply is E zero divided by
R. So this value is E zero

68
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,090
divided by R.

69
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,420
Now since the E zero is a
constant, you see immediately,

70
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,750
that if I make R smaller,
that I get a

71
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,180
peak which goes higher.

72
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,100
So this is my short
hand notation

73
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,550
for saying R is small.

74
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,070
And if you prefer a much larger

75
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:06,115
value for R, R is large.

76
00:05:06,115 --> 00:05:11,560

77
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:18,260
Omega zero is independent of
R. But keep in mind, that I

78
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:23,610
zero maximum, which is this
value here, that is

79
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:30,120
independent of L and C. That
only depends on R and of

80
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,295
course on the value that we
have chosen for E zero.

81
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:38,620

82
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:45,380
If we look at this solution,
we gives names to these

83
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:53,110
quantities, omega L
1 over omega C. We

84
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,360
call this the reactance.

85
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,140

86
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:04,630
Omega L is the reactance of
the self inductor, it has

87
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,360
dimensions ohm.

88
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,810
And 1 over omega C is the
reactance of the capacitor,

89
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,320
which also has units
in terms of v.

90
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:26,580
And we call this entire square
root, we call that Z. And that

91
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,560
is called the impedance.

92
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:35,130
Just words, but it's useful
to remember them.

93
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:39,545
When omega goes up, this value
becomes very large.

94
00:06:39,545 --> 00:06:43,550

95
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,740
When omega becomes large,
sorry, this value

96
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,360
becomes very small.

97
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,660
And the capacitor plays
a minor role

98
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,320
and L has a big effect.

99
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,880
Because if omega is large,
omega L is large.

100
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,870
Well immediately obvious,
because if omega is large, dI

101
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,420
dt, the change of current with
time is very fast. Because

102
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,470
that's means a high frequency.

103
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,970
And so L becomes powerful.

104
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:15,540
If omega is low, then the L
plays a minor role, but then

105
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,030
the C becomes very important.

106
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,250
In your mind, if you make omega
go to zero, that means

107
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:27,610
that there's almost no
change in the emf

108
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,420
of the driving voltage.

109
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,870
The capacitor simply
blocks the current.

110
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,340
It's like an opening
in the wires.

111
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,090
So it's very low value value
of omega when omega goes to

112
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,610
zero, it's obvious that the
current and goes to zero.

113
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,880
Are you see that because when
omega become zero, this value

114
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,140
goes to infinity.

115
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,740
And indeed you see that the
current goes to zero.

116
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,200
So it does make sense to think a
little bit about the role of

117
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,780
omega, of L, and the role of C
in terms of this amplitude of

118
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,610
the current.
