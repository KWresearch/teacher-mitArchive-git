1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,830

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:10,890
31-29.

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:15,470
We have an L, we have
a C. R is zero.

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:17,085
Epsilon zero is zero.

5
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:19,590
So there is no driving
voltage.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,650
And t equals zero.

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,920
I equals zero.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,890
And Q of the capacitor is either
plus or minus Q zero.

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,360
One plate of course has a
positive charge and the other

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,800
plate has a negative charge.

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,140
Positive, negative.

12
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:41,290
I have some kind of
a switch here.

13
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,300
I have a self inductance here.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,960
This is C and this
is L. I close the

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,370
switch at time t zero.

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:51,190
The current must be zero because
the self inductance

17
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,100
opposes any sudden increase.

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,740
And so we want to evaluate now
how the current is sloshing

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,860
back and forth.

20
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:07,400
This value, as you can
calculate, is 0.0144 Coulombs,

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,460
as the whole process starts.

22
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:18,320
Well, in order to meet the
initial condition, I equals I

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,590
zero times the sine of omega t,
the phi is zero here, omega

24
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:30,940
squared equals one over LC,
which is omega zero squared.

25
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:36,070
Because notice, there
is no resistance.

26
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,160
Or this is the frequency at
which the system wants to

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,310
drive itself, but
there is no R.

28
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,030
So when you go back to the
beginning of my session, you

29
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,850
will see when you make R equal
zero that you get the natural

30
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,860
frequency of the system, omega
zero, is the one at which the

31
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,790
current will start to slosh.

32
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,470
The charge on the capacitor
will be some maximum value

33
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,940
times the cosine of omega t,
because remember I is dQ dt.

34
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,300

35
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:11,770
I equals dQ/dt.

36
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,190
I take absolute values
because I'm only

37
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,320
interested in the magnitude.

38
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,640
And that will be Q zero
times omega times the

39
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,680
sine of omega t.

40
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,970
Notice I left the minus sign
out, because I'm only

41
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,030
interested in absolute values.

42
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:38,290
Now when I equals I zero, all
energy is in the L. In

43
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,360
magnetic energy.

44
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,210
Once half L I zero squared.

45
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:51,900
Now when I is zero, all energy
is in the capacitor in the

46
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,710
form of one half Q zero squared
divided by C and

47
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,970
there's no magnetic energy.

48
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,050

49
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:13,520
Again, the voltages, as you
would see them if you attached

50
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,800
both meters, over the C and
over the L would be 180

51
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,682
degrees out of face.

52
00:03:20,682 --> 00:03:24,330
I want to remind you of that.

53
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,930
So you've got a sloshing
current back and forth.

54
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:31,350
And you got a conversion from
all magnetic energy to all

55
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,600
electric energy.

56
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,980

57
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,560
There's no R, so there's
no heat loss.

58
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,780
So the whole thing keeps
flushing back and forth and

59
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,330
there's never any end to it.

60
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:49,200
Because it's only the R that
will ultimately take out all

61
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,730
the energy.

62
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,660
But there wasn't any.
