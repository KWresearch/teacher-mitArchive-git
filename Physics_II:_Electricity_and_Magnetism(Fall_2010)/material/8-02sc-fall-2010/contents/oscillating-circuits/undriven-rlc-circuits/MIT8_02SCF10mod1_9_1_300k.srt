00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,670

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,480
PROFESSOR LEWIN: First, let's
review R L C circuits.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,420
R L C circuits in series.

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,740
I have here, a resistor.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,480

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,730
I have here, a capacitor.

7
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,060

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:30,930
And here, a self inductor, L.
And here, I have some kinds of

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,660
a voltage source.

10
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,620
I call it E. And it could have
various different natures, as

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,090
we will see very shortly.

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:53,250
That's call this points
b, a, c, d, back to a.

13
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,570
The way I start these problems
always, there's nothing wrong

14
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,850
with that, I assume at one
moment in time that this is

15
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,700
positive and this is negative.

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,090
I assume that there's no charge
anywhere on the system,

17
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,710
on the capacitor.

18
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:13,890
And so a current will start to
flow after a while, I. That

19
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,600
current will charge this side of
the capacitor positive and

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,320
this one negative.

21
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,680
And it will return.

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,630
If we look at the
electric fields.

23
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,495
There must be an electric
field, E,

24
00:01:25,495 --> 00:01:27,660
here in this direction.

25
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,730
There must be electric fields
here in the capacitor, also in

26
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,190
this direction, going
from plus to minus.

27
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,910
There's no electric field in the
self inductor because the

28
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,290
self inductor is made of
super conducting wire.

29
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,930
Just as all these wires
have no resistance.

30
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,800
And inside the battery, the
E field is opposing.

31
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,950
It goes from plus to minus.

32
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:55,400
I now apply Faraday's
law, and I go around

33
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,690
this closed loop circuit.

34
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:00,830
And I attached to the close
loop an open surface.

35
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,070
Closed loop integral.

36
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,090
I attach to that,
an open surface.

37
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,090
And the open surface is
easy to see here.

38
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:10,980
It's flat.

39
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,520
It's not too easy to see here.

40
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,300
We discussed that earlier.

41
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,470
It is some staircase
kind of surface.

42
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,150
I don't want to go into
that anymore.

43
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,810
But what is important is that
the magnetic flux inside the

44
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,040
solenoid penetrates this
open surface n

45
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,680
times if you n windings.

46
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,790
We hit that very
hard last time.

47
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,360
So here comes Faraday's law.

48
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,630
The closed loop integral of
E.dl, I split that up in an

49
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,960
integral and going
from a to b.

50
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,250
Plus the integral in
going from b to

51
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,990
c through the resistor.

52
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,040
Plus the integral in
going from c to

53
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,610
d through the capacitor.

54
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,970
Plus the integral in going from
d back to a through the

55
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,320
self conductor.

56
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,500
And this now, according to
Faraday's law, equals minus

57
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:12,510
d/dt of the magnetic flux
through that open

58
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,340
surface B.dA .

59
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,920
And it also equals
minus dI/dt .

60
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,920
We discussed that last time
so I won't go into it.

61
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,880
Now, what is the integral in
going through the battery,

62
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,360
that is minus E. Notice, I go
against the electric field if

63
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,600
I go around like this.

64
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,320
Here I go with the
electric field.

65
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,600
So it's plus IR.

66
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,870
Here I plus the electric field,
so it is plus Q divided

67
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,720
by C. And remember that
Q is always the

68
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,360
charge on the capacitor.

69
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,910
Nothing else make sense.

70
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,750
Whenever I use Q it is always
the of the capacitor.

71
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,690
And of course, there is equal
amount of positive charge here

72
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,010
as there is negative
charge here.

73
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:14,650
What is the integral of, from
b to a through the self

74
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,040
inductance?

75
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,070
Well that's zero because there's
no electric fields in

76
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,740
the self inductance.

77
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,340
Kirchhoff's law does not hold.

78
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,700
The closed loop integral
E.dl is not zero.

79
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,020
It's minus L dI/dt.

80
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,350

81
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:32,590
The relation by the way, between
this Q c and the

82
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:39,030
current is I equals dQ
on the capacitor dt.

83
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,445
That relates the current with
the charge on the capacitor.

84
00:04:42,445 --> 00:04:45,640

85
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,765
Now, I'm going to reorganize
this a little bit.

86
00:04:50,765 --> 00:04:57,580
I may have to save this one
because I may need it later.

87
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:06,500
So using I equals plus dQ / dt,
I find now that Q doubled

88
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:15,170
dot plus R over L times
Q dot plus Q over l

89
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,690
c equals that emf.

90
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,460
That is the emf, which
is the driver.

91
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,330
The one that could have
various natures.

92
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,170
It could be zero.

93
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,170
It's not necessary that
there is an emf.

94
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,580
It could very well be that this
has short circuited and

95
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,460
that we start at some initial
condition when the capacitor

96
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,360
is charged, we throw a switch
and some currents

97
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,350
will begin to flow.

98
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,260
So E would be zero.

99
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,820
There's also a possibility
that E is constant.

100
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,930
We would call that a battery.

101
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,210
And then there is the
possibility, when we deal with

102
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,930
alternating currents that E
equals E zero times the

103
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,400
cosine omega t.

104
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,400
But of course, any other
function is possible.

105
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,790
E could have this function.

106
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,120

107
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,270
This profile as a function
of time.

108
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,520
Or this one.

109
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,020

110
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:23,320
We will only in 802, deal
with these two.

111
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,110
And I will first consider
the first two.

112
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,110
You can also write this one
using I equals dQ/dt.

113
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:39,180
That I double dot plus R divided
by L times I dot plus

114
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:45,320
I over LC equals dE/dt.

115
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:52,080
The derivative of this driving
voltage so to speak.

116
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,290
Now if we first take the case
that the emf is zero.

117
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,270
There is no emf.

118
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,965
Or that it is constant.

119
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:02,720

120
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,070
Then what you are going to see
is, you're going to get into

121
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,940
the circuit, under certain
conditions, and I will specify

122
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,220
those conditions, an alternating
current, which

123
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,830
will ultimately die out.

124
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,110
If you think about it a little
bit, it's immediately obvious

125
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,780
why it has to die out.

126
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:26,960
We call this regime, the regime
of the light damping.

127
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,590
And I will only discuss this
regime of light damping and I

128
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,260
will specify what exactly
I mean by that.

129
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,280

130
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,850
I choose arbitrarily
that I equals zero

131
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,570
when t equals zero.

132
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:56,660
And when I do that, I find for a
solution for a constant emf,

133
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:03,840
emf could also be zero, equals
I zero times E to the minus t

134
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:13,450
over 2L divided by R times
the sine of omega t.

135
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:18,680
And the value 2L over R
could be called tau.

136
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,560
That is the decay constant.

137
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,280
And you will see shortly what I
mean by that decay constant.

138
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,590
Omega is now entirely dictated
by the various components L

139
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:42,600
and C and R. We call this one,
and you will see shortly why,

140
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:48,260
we call this one, omega
zero squared.

141
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,880
Now omega has to be real,
otherwise this would not have

142
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,750
a solution.

143
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,000
And that immediately tells you
then, what the conditions are

144
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,170
for light damping.

145
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:03,890
If 1 over LC is larger than
R squared divided by 4 L

146
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:08,480
squared, which is a condition
for a real value for omega, it

147
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,720
is required that R by smaller
that 2 times the L over C.

148
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,540
That would then be the case of
what I am discussing today of

149
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,500
light damping.

150
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,480
If this is not the case, you get
a different behavior which

151
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,730
I will not discuss.

152
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,290

153
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:33,470
What now, will the current
look like as

154
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,610
a function of time?

155
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:41,590
Well, here is I. We started at
I equals zero, that was the

156
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,270
initial condition.

157
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:51,630
And this exponential decay is
like an envelope that pinches

158
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,820
the current off.

159
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:59,470
It will make the current
die down.

160
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,130
Zero crossings are
equally spaced.

161
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,870

162
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:12,770
With a period t, which is
2 pi divided by omega.

163
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:18,610
And this then, is very closely
the period t that I have here.

164
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,950
And these periods, t,
remain constant.

165
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:28,670
And this curve here, is
this E to the minus.

166
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,820
And this is then
this exponent.

167
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:39,800
This is the envelope, which
squeezes down the current.

168
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,230
There is a mechanical energy
which is easy to see and that

169
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:46,400
may help you a little bit.

170
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,230
If I have here a spring, and I
have an object hanging on the

171
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:52,560
spring with mass m.

172
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,930
And then it oscillates about
this equilibrium position.

173
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:04,380
Then what you're going to see,
if you damp the mass in a way

174
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,450
that the fictional force opposes
the velocity, and is

175
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,180
linearly proportional of
velocity then you get exactly

176
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,910
the similar kind of differential
equation that we

177
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,580
had before.

178
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,640
Except you don't see L,
you don't see R's, you

179
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,710
don't see C's .

180
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:23,080
You see other symbols like
M's and V's, whatever.

181
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,380
I think you've seen them 801.

182
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,190
This kind of behavior
is exactly the same.

183
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:37,950
It is an oscillating bob,
exponential decay.

184
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:42,180
And when n goes through
equilibrium, you have here,

185
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,380
all the energy in the bob, in
terms of kinetic energy, which

186
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,620
is one half m v max squared.

187
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:56,190
But when the bob comes here to a
halt, so v is zero, then you

188
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,930
have all the energy
in potential

189
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,350
energy of the spring.

190
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:06,410
Which is one half
k x max squared.

191
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:11,070
And of course this x max, in
this case you will have x

192
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:15,370
here, this x max, slowly
decays in time.

193
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,890
So what you see here, is
interesting, you see a

194
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:22,390
sloshing back and forth between
on the one hand all

195
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,580
the energy in terms
of kinetic energy.

196
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,500
And then later everything
in potential energy.

197
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,890
And when you are anywhere
in between, you have a

198
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:32,570
combination of these two.

199
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:38,570
Now, in a similar way, with
the R M C circuits, as the

200
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:43,310
currents oscillate back and
forth, there's a time that the

201
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:48,087
capacitor has all the
energy in the

202
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:49,337
form of electric energy.

203
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:52,180

204
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,220
That is the situation
when I equals zero.

205
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:03,770
And the energy in
the capacitor is

206
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,580
then one half Q zero.

207
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,180
It is the maximum
value possible,

208
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,430
which decays with time.

209
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,500
Everything is an electric
energy.

210
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:18,470
And the energy in L, magnetic
energy, equals zero.

211
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:22,380
Then there comes a time, that
I reaches a maximum, which

212
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,650
again dies out.

213
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,160
The maximum decays.

214
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,150
And then Q on the capacitor is
zero, and then all the energy

215
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:33,500
is in terms of magnetic
energy.

216
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,040
There's no electric energy.

217
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:39,320
And that equals one half
LI which is the

218
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,180
maximum value squared.

219
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:44,690
So also here, you see this
sloshing back and forth

220
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,080
between two different
kinds of energy.

221
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:51,510
Magnetic energy, which at one
moment in time is all in the

222
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:56,430
inductor, a little later, a
quarter of an oscillation

223
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:00,137
later, everything is in terms
of electric energy in the

224
00:14:00,137 --> 00:14:02,840
capacitor and it keeps sloshing
back and forth,

225
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,540
similar to the oscillating
spring.
