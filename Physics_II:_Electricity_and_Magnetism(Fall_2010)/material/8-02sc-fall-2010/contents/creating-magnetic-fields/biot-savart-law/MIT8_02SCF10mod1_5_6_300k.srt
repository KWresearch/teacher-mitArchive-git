1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,850

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,100
Problem number 7.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,680

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,630
29-52.

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:19,530
And here we have to deal
with Biot and Savart.

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,090
Two Frenchmen.

7
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:28,370
Biot and Savart said, if I have
a small element of a wire

8
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:32,720
that draws a current, 'dl' is
always in the direction of

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,970
that current.

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,320

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,870
If I want to know, at a
particular position here, what

12
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,870
the magnetic field is due to
this small element alone, then

13
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,910
they argued--

14
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,600
they call this the vector 'r'.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,870
From the current element to that
point 'P', where you want

16
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,620
to know the magnetic field.

17
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,740
This is the unit vector 'r'.

18
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,340

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:15,100
They argued that the 'dB' right
here, 'dB' equals 'mu 0'

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:25,380
divided by '4 pi' times 'i'
times 'dl cross r' divided by

21
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,270
'r squared'.

22
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,350
It was interesting that they
have an 'r squared'.

23
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:34,240
They like the idea, of course of
Coulomb's law, whereby the

24
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,090
electric field force is
'1 over r squared'.

25
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:41,450
And they intuitively sensed,
well, the 'B' field due to

26
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:44,250
such a small line element would
also fall off as '1 over

27
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,480
r squared'.

28
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,190
That's certainly
not incorrect.

29
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,860
But you cannot have a short
section of wire in isolation.

30
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,840
You must always have a closed
loop, otherwise

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,220
you can't run a current.

32
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,650
And when you take that into
account, you will never see '1

33
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,175
over r squared' magnetic
field.

34
00:02:02,175 --> 00:02:04,870
It's always a '1/r'.

35
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,400
Or, in some special cases, you
can have '1/r cubed' field.

36
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,670
When you have magnetic dipole
fields, but we will get back

37
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,570
to that later.

38
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,290
But never a '1 over
r squared'.

39
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,480
So that is Biot and Savart.

40
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,880
And you have to use Biot and
Savart when you deal with

41
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,300
short sections of wire.

42
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,170
When you use infinite wires,
then you can always Ampere's

43
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,970
law, but that's not
the case here.

44
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,130
The direction of the 'dB' must
be perpendicular a 'dl' and

45
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,000
must be perpendicular to 'r'
it's a cross product.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,365
So perpendicular to 'dl,
perpendicular to 'r' to must

47
00:02:41,365 --> 00:02:43,790
be perpendicular to the paper.

48
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,730
'dl' cross 'r', you can
do that yourself.

49
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,970
'dl' is always in the
direction 'i'.

50
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:56,490
That I think, is pointing in the
paper, in this direction.

51
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:58,515
Now we have the following
configuration.

52
00:02:58,515 --> 00:03:04,880

53
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,370
There's a current
flowing here.

54
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,290

55
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,500
'i in' and 'i out'.

56
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,600
Goes up here, goes here,
goes down here, here,

57
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,390
and comes back bere.

58
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,910
I will call this little section
1, this little section

59
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,010
2, I will call this [? coil ?]

60
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:30,460
3 and this wire I continued as
a continuous wire, I consider

61
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,480
that a continuous wire,
I call that 4.

62
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,820
You are being asked what the
magnetic field is right at the

63
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:42,580
center here, at point 'P'.

64
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,420
You should be able to convince
yourself that all these wires,

65
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:52,080
1, 2, 3, and 4 in all cases
contribute to a magnetic field

66
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,010
that is pointing in
the blackboard.

67
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,700
In all four cases.

68
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,280
So they support each other.

69
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,420
Convince yourself of that, it's
the logical consequence

70
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,370
of this cross product.

71
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,280
Now 1 and 3 will have obviously
exactly the same

72
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,600
effect, so it's enough
that you only

73
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,720
calculate 1 double it.

74
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,110
2 and 4 also have the
same effect in

75
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,760
magnitude, and in direction.

76
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,380
So it's enough that you
calculate 2 and double that,

77
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,630
if you so desire.

78
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,030

79
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:28,270
I will set up the situation,
in general terms, and then

80
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,100
I'll leave you alone
with the details.

81
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,470
My script falls on the floor,
I have to go and get it.

82
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:42,590

83
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:47,790
You won't me for a minute, but
it's a small price to pay.

84
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,100
That was my script.

85
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,840
I also lost something else
which fell on the floor.

86
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,350
I will get that in
the meantime.

87
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,600
I need that for a
demonstration.

88
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,190

89
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,120
I'm back in business.

90
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,575
The table is a bit small and
yeah occasionally things fall

91
00:05:03,575 --> 00:05:04,460
on the floor.

92
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,130
It does happen.

93
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,410
I'm going to set
it up for you.

94
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,060
In general terms, and then you
work out the details with the

95
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,140
particular geometry.

96
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,450
If I have here a wire which
has a finite length 'l', I

97
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:26,120
call this the x- direction, here
is 0, here is 1/2'l' .

98
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,410

99
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,380
1/2 and here is '-1/2 l'.

100
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:39,650
There's a current flowing in
this direction I'i', and I

101
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,600
consider here a small
element 'dx'.

102
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,790
Think of that that as being
'dl' in our Biot Savart

103
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,110
calculation.

104
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,840
And I would like to know what
here at the point 'P', at a

105
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,080
distance 'd' the from the wire,
the magnetic fields is.

106
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,010
The magnetic field contribution
will be

107
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,070
perpendicular to the paper
and in the paper.

108
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,200
That you should be able to
figure out for yourself now.

109
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,020
And there is a contribution
'dB'.

110
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,930

111
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:17,900
So I draw this line, this is
that vector 'r', and the units

112
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:23,830
vector 'r' is in
this direction.

113
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,080
Now what is 'dB'?

114
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,020

115
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,296
I take the magnitude, because I
already know the direction,

116
00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:34,550
it's down, so I'm not interested
in that anymore.

117
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:40,570
Equals 'mu 0' times 'i', divided
by '4 pi' times the

118
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,570
sine of theta because, remember,
it's a cross product

119
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:46,730
and if this angle is theta I
have to take the cross product

120
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,760
into account between
'dx' and 'r'.

121
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,870
And then I got 'dx', which is my
'dl' and I divide the whole

122
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,180
thing by 'r squared'.

123
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:04,720
I also know that the sine of
theta equals 'd' divided by

124
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,320
'r', and I also know that 'r'
equals the square root of 'd

125
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,350
squared' plus 'x squared'.

126
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,680
If I call the distance from here
to my element that I have

127
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,600
chosen, if I call that 'x'.

128
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:26,330
So that means that I will find
that 'B' equals twice, because

129
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,760
I'm going to integrate only from
here to there, but I must

130
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,540
take this part into account,
so double it because it's

131
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,700
completely symmetric, so
I can put a 2 here.

132
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:44,270
Integral from 0 to '1/2 l', 'mu
0' divided by '4 pi' times

133
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:51,210
'i' times 'd' and now I get
here 'dx' divided by 'x

134
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:57,310
squared' plus 'd squared'
to the power 3/2.

135
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,740
Perhaps you remember that we
have seen this one before and

136
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,590
perhaps you remember my honesty
when I said, I looked

137
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,480
it up, what it was.

138
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,230
And I even asked my graduate
student to check it, and I'm

139
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,130
not going to do that now.

140
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,940
We've done it before, you've
done it before, you were much

141
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,510
better at it than I am.

142
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:22,930
You can solve that integral
without any doubt.

143
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,790
When you have solved this
integral I think it's

144
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:29,660
interesting that you should at
least convince yourself that

145
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,020
if l goes up, if you make 'l'
longer, then you better must

146
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,380
find that 'B' increases.

147
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:39,870
That's completely intuitive
for a given value of 'd'.

148
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,550
You would also want to find that
if you make 'd' larger

149
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,440
that 'B' goes down.

150
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,030
Because if you're farther
away you got a

151
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,150
smaller magnetic field.

152
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,040
And so that's at least the
minimum you can check when you

153
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,780
get your final answer.

154
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,420
Other than that, I have
no wisdom on this.

155
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,740
You can do this problem now.

156
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,960
For this particular geometry,
and the particular geometry is

157
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,010
not just one line, but you
have various lines with a

158
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:13,150
little section 1, what I
have called 'l', you

159
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,560
would call that 'a'.

160
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,480
And what I have called 'd'
you would call '1/2 b'.

161
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,640
And you can do that for
the other sections

162
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,850
2, 3, and 4 as well.

163
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,765
