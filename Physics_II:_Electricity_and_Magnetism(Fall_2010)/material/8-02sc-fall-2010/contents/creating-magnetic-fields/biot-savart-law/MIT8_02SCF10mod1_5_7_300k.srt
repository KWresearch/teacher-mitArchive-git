1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,150
PROFESSOR: Problem number 8.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,910
And problem number 8 is 29-54.

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,430
Now we deal with
circular wires.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,560

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,510
Half circle.

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,760
And another half circle.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,320

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,570
Here's is a point, let's call
this point 'P', exactly at the

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,870
center of these circles.

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,330
And there's a current flowing,
there's a current flowing in

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:43,210
this direction, i; i; i; i; i.

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,870

14
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,040
This has a radius 'a', and
this has a radius 'b'.

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,010

16
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:06,250
If we, again, give these lines
numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, then it

17
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,000
is immediately obvious that 2
and 4 do not contribute to the

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,750
magnetic field at 'B', because
the sine of theta equals 0 in

19
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,670
this cross product.

20
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,120
So we only deal with
3 and with 1.

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,420
Now 1 is going to give me a
magnetic field which is

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,740
pointing perpendicular to
the paper, in the paper.

23
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,150
This is 1.

24
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:36,520
But 3 will give me one that is
in the opposite direction,

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,210
coming out of the paper.

26
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,810
So this one is due to 3.

27
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,760
And this one will be stronger
than this one because the

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,880
radius is smaller.

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,740
The current is the same, the
radius is smaller, it is

30
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,590
therefore closer to the
wire, so the magnetic

31
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,390
field will be stronger.

32
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,300
This will be the winner, so
finally the magnetic field

33
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,025
will be pointing upwards.

34
00:01:57,025 --> 00:02:00,305

35
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:04,420
What I propose to do is to
simply calculate for you the

36
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,850
magnetic field of one arc, and
then I'm sure that you can do

37
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:12,920
the superposition
for both arcs.

38
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,150
Here's one arc.

39
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,930
I call this point 'A' and I call
this 'D', and this is the

40
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:24,610
center, it is 'P'.

41
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,780
I have a current 'i' in this
direction, and I have here a

42
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,540
little element 'dl'.

43
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:35,180

44
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:42,900
I have here this vector 'r', and
the unit vector 'r' is in

45
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,150
this direction.

46
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,840

47
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,070
Let the radius of this circle
be capital 'R'.

48
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:56,480

49
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,590
What is interesting that every
element 'dl', for every

50
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:05,430
element 'dl', 'r' is
perpendicular to 'dl'.

51
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,200

52
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:14,860
Therefore, in all cases, is the
sine of that angle theta

53
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,990
is the same.

54
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,650
1.

55
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:24,240
Whether it is plus or minus 1,
it is a matter of taste.

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:30,810
The dot product is 'dl' cross
'r', sine of theta, 90

57
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,540
degrees, is 1.

58
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,270
If you want to call it
-1, I don't care.

59
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,950
I really don't care.

60
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,530
Because I do know that the
magnetic field is in this

61
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,800
direction, and that's ultimately
all I want to know.

62
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,260

63
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:53,770
So I can delete the cross and I
can write down now what the

64
00:03:53,770 --> 00:04:01,210
magnitude of dB is which is 'mu
0' times 'i', divided by

65
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:06,510
'4 pi' and I do know a very
dirty integral from 'A' to

66
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:15,510
'D', along this arc, of 'dl'
divided by 'R squared'.

67
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:21,080
But the integral of 'dl' is
simply '2 pi R', so what comes

68
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:29,220
out of this is that the--

69
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,940
oh this should be the
integral of 'dB', so

70
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,190
this is really 'B'.

71
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,540

72
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,020
It's the integral of all these
elements, so what comes out at

73
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,620
'B', at that point 'P'
equals 'mu 0' times

74
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,630
'i' divided by '4R'.

75
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,990

76
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,600
Notice that it's inversely
proportion to '1/R'.

77
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,300
And that is very
characteristic.

78
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,380
You will never find an
inverse 'R squared'.

79
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,880
Now you have to do another
current which goes in the

80
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,940
opposite direction, and so you
have to add to the two

81
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,060
factorially, and I will
leave you with that.

82
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,960
I don't think that's going
to be a problem at all.

83
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,210
