1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,960
All right then.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:21,110
Now we are coming again to an
example of Ampere's law.

4
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,870
I believe it's the last
one, I'm not sure.

5
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:33,070
We have here a very large sheet,
very wide, very long,

6
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:39,050
and it has uniform charge
density plus everywhere.

7
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,260
Charge density 'sigma'.

8
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:47,160
And it is moving in this
direction with a speed 'v'.

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,010

10
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,120
If I look from this direction
I would see here that width

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,460
'w' coming towards me, I would
see the velocity vector coming

12
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,800
towards me.

13
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,620
So this thing is coming
towards me.

14
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:09,140
And it is uniformly charged with
charge density 'sigma'.

15
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,920
Now I have to choose cleverly
a closed loop in order to

16
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,530
apply Ampere's law.

17
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,380
This dotted line is
in the surface.

18
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,240
I go up by a certain
distance 'd'.

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,820
This here has a certain length
'l', which I can choose

20
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,460
arbitrarily.

21
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,830
This is 'd'.

22
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,960
I go down over the
distance 'd'.

23
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,470
I come below the surface,
again distance 'd'.

24
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,220
I return and I go up here.

25
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,030
This is 'd', this is 'l'.

26
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,910
It's really easy to
draw it here.

27
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,890

28
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,000
So this is 'd.' 'd.' 'l'.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,250
'l'.

30
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,510

31
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,210
It shouldn't be hard for you to
convince yourself, which is

32
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,740
by convention, that the 'B'
field here must be in this

33
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,540
direction and that
the 'B' field

34
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,980
there is in this direction.

35
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,220
Now what I'm going to do, I'm
going to do the closed loop

36
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,690
integral of this loop.

37
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,760
I'm going to choose a flat
surface to calculate the

38
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,630
current going through
that flat surface.

39
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,800
That's this flat surface.

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,740
As the belt moves, charges
going through, you can

41
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,350
calculate how much charge
goes through per second.

42
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,590
I also I'm going to make
'd' very small.

43
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,270
I'm going to make
'd' going to 0.

44
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:45,000
So that means when I make this
integral 'B' dot 'dl' , I have

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,700
simply 'B' times 'l', because
they are in the same direction

46
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,960
so the dot product simply
gives me a cosine

47
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,180
of the angle 1.

48
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,160
0 here because I make 'd' 0.

49
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,900
Very small.

50
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,860
And then I have another
'Bl' here.

51
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,300
Because they again are in
the same direction.

52
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,750
And that now equals 'mu0'
times the current

53
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,680
through that surface.

54
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,930
'i thru' .

55
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,840

56
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,280
Well 'i thru' is the charge
that going through that

57
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,390
surface per second and
that equals 'l' times

58
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:26,700
'sigma' times 'v'.

59
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,440
You should be able to convince
yourself of this very easily.

60
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:38,060
That leads then to a magnetic
field which is 'mu0' times

61
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,940
'sigma' times 'v'
divided by 2.

62
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,640
Notice the faster the belt moves
the higher the current

63
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,540
is through the surface, the
higher the magnetic field.

64
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,960
The higher the surface charge
density, the higher the

65
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,330
magnetic field.

66
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,380
Notice also it's the
same on both sides.

67
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,900

68
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,010
There's no dependence on 'z.' If
I call this 'z', there's no

69
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,260
dependence on that.

70
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,590

71
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:19,330
This is slightly similar to
the case that we had early

72
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:26,740
whereby we had a very large
plane, uniformly charged with

73
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,220
a positive or negative charge.

74
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,800
We also there had that the
electric field, provided that

75
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,830
the sheet is large enough,
is independent of 'z'.

76
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,730
It's the same above the plane,
pointing upwards if it is

77
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,940
positive charge.

78
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,540
And down the plane it is
pointing downwards, but the

79
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,270
magnitudes are the same.

80
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:53,110
You see something very similar
here, this is that factor 2.

81
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,150
For an infinite charged plane,
the electric field, you may

82
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:02,240
recall, equals 'sigma' divided
by '2 epsilon 0'.

83
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,720

84
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,020
If you accept the fact that
the magnetic field is

85
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,930
independent of 'z', you could
also argue that if there is a

86
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,450
magnetic field here, and if the
sheet is very long, that

87
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,240
even if 'd' is not very small,
that 'B' would always be

88
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,090
perpendicular to 'd'
here and here.

89
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,610
Therefore the dot product
would disappear anyhow.

90
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,840
Even though I made 'd' going
to 0 to convince you that

91
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:39,490
there would be no contribution
here of integral 'B dot dl',

92
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:42,390
if you had accepted the fact
that the magnetic field here

93
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,020
is always in this direction,
and here is

94
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,010
always in this direction.

95
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,880
Not necessarily accepting the
fact that they have the same

96
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,970
magnitude independent of 'z',
you would still agreed that

97
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,120
'B' and 'dl' here would be
perpendicular to each other.

98
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,070
And therefore there would
be no contributions.

99
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,910
Now you have to finish
this problem.

100
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,160
You have two sheets.

101
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,470

102
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,850
I have here two sheets.

103
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,020

104
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:21,815
This has, again, sigma and I
have another one, also huge in

105
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,820
side, also '+ sigma'.

106
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,390
Uniformly charged.

107
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,520
But one is going in this
direction and the other one is

108
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,340
going in this direction.

109
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,600
We have a point 'A' here, we
have a point 'D' between the

110
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,600
plates, and we have a point
'C' below the plates.

111
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,400
I avoid the 'B' here, because
I don't like 'B's' when we

112
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,720
deal with magnetic fields.

113
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,060
Assume that these sheets
are infinitely large.

114
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,190
You can calculate what the
magnetic field above this one

115
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,210
is, and below this one.

116
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,660
You can do the same here.

117
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,720
And you obviously apply the
super position principle.

118
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,710
If you apply the super position
principal it's

119
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:04,780
immediately obvious that at 'A'
the magnetic field must

120
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,990
vanish, because the two plates
create a magnetic field which

121
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,900
is the same but in opposite
direction.

122
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,370
It will also vanished
at point 'C'.

123
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,840
But, of course, between the
plates the two fields will

124
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,950
enforce each other.

125
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,420
I don't think you're going
to have too much

126
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,430
trouble with this one.

127
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,910
I think it's about time
that we start

128
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,110
talking Faraday's law.

129
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,800
Not yet.

130
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,040
We're close but not yet.

131
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,600
Professor Becker invented acute
problem of a cylinder

132
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,620
which has a certain
length 'l'.

133
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,140
It's a hollow cylinder and it
is rotating with angular

134
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,820
velocity 'omega'.

135
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:53,965
Has radius 'a', and there is a
surface charges density '+

136
00:07:53,965 --> 00:07:57,130
sigma', only on the surface of
the shell of the cylinder.

137
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,630

138
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,040
You are being asked what is the
magnetic field inside and

139
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,030
outside the cylinder.

140
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,500
Now first I would like you to
read up on page 920, because

141
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,000
it is very similar
to a solenoid.

142
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,730
A solenoid of winding, separate
windings, and

143
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,370
currents are going around
in a spiral.

144
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,150
Well here this drum
is going around.

145
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,450
So this is also currents
going around.

146
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:29,070
I'm going to solve this from
an over simplified case

147
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,440
whereby 'l', in my mind,
is going to infinity.

148
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,400
It's very, very long.

149
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,120
And I'm going to apply Ampere's
law and I have to

150
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,980
choose a very, very
clever loop.

151
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:50,960
Here is another view
of that cylinder.

152
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,730
Here is this radius 'A', it's
going around with angular

153
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,660
velocity 'omega'.

154
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,750
And the loop that I'm going
to choose is this loop.

155
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,750

156
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:11,820
The loop 'I' choose is at a
distance little 'r' from the

157
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,850
center line.

158
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,260
And this distance
'd' I'm going to

159
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,030
make very, very large.

160
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:24,530
Let this be 'b', this length,
and let this be 'b'.

161
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:30,880
I now have to apply Ampere's
law, closed loop integral, of

162
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:37,970
'B dot dl' equals 'mu0'
times 'i thru'.

163
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:41,390
It's clear that this is going
to be my surface, and I have

164
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,710
to calculate the current going
through that surface.

165
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:50,250
But that's only right here where
charge is moving through

166
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,990
this surface inside the plane.

167
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,490

168
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,370
The magnetic fields, by
convention, must be here in

169
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,680
this direction.

170
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,690
The magnetic field here, if I'm
very, very far away from

171
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,860
the cylinder, clearly
has to be 0.

172
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,860
And the magnetic field here,
well, if there is any, it

173
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,300
would have to be in
this direction

174
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,850
for reasons of symmetry.

175
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:25,430
Well here it is clearly
everywhere perpendicular to

176
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:28,130
the 'dl' if I go around
in this direction.

177
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,550
And it's everywhere
perpendicular to the 'dl' if I

178
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,830
go in this direction.

179
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,900
So there's no contribution to
this term of this part, of

180
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,250
this part, and of this part,
because 'B' is 0. so I only

181
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,840
have a contribution here.

182
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,680
What do I get?

183
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:49,800
'B' at that location 'r' times
'b' equals 'mu0' times 'i

184
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,550
thru' and 'i thru' equals
'sigma' times 'v' times 'b'.

185
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,530
If you want to write
down for this omega

186
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,940
'r', it that is fine.

187
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,200

188
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,810
Omega--

189
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,750
not 'r' but 'a'.

190
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,630
It's not 'r' but it is 'a',
because the current goes

191
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,690
through here.

192
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:18,750
So the velocity there is omega
'a' times 'b', 'Br' times 'b,'

193
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,570
and clearly you see you lose
your little 'b', of course.

194
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,360
Because Faraday's law doesn't
care about how long

195
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,250
you choose this loop.

196
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,400
Here you see that the magnetic
field increases when omega

197
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,620
goes up, that is intuitive.

198
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,040
And it also increases if you
had more surface charge on

199
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,290
your cylinder.

200
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:46,210

201
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,740
What happens now with the
magnetic field just outside

202
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,440
the cylinder?

203
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:55,530
In other words, if I don't
make 'd' very, very long.

204
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,560
What may not be so intuitive
that if indeed the cylinder

205
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:05,820
infinitely long, that only
then the magnetic field

206
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:11,032
outside the cylinder is to
a good approximation 0.

207
00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:14,240
Here is now this closed loop.

208
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,730
I again have a certain distance
'r' here, but I have

209
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:25,110
already shown that 'B of r', for
'r' is smaller then 'a' is

210
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,880
independent of 'r'.

211
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,380
Notice when you look at my
previous results that there's

212
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,940
no little 'r' in here.

213
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,760
So it's constant inside this
cylinder just like it was

214
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,220
constant inside the solenoid.

215
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,700
To a reasonable approximation.

216
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,310

217
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,160
This is 'b' and this is 'b'.

218
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,100
I'm going around like this.

219
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,660
This is my surface.

220
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,020
And so I'm going to get that
'b', I call this magnetic

221
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,110
field here inside, times 'b'.

222
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,150
This part is 0 because
the dot product is 0.

223
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:08,820
Here I have a 'B' outside, but
since 'B' outside and my 'dl'

224
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,890
are in the same direction, I get
'B' outside times little

225
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:17,370
'b', that now equals 'mu0' times
'i thru', which we just

226
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,170
calculated.

227
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:24,070
But we already showed that this
is the same as that in

228
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,650
the previous calculation.

229
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,760
So there's only one possibility
that this is 0 and

230
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,440
so the magnetic field outside
the solenoid, independent or

231
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,840
how far you are away,
equals 0.

232
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:42,320
I really strongly advise you
to, again, read up on page

233
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,480
920, where we have cases where
the cylinder is not infinitely

234
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,610
long, the solenoid is not
infinitely long, and then you

235
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:55,170
do see magnetic fields here
leaking out, so to speak.

236
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,610
Very well.

237
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:01,050
There is a way, perhaps, that
I can make you see in an

238
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:05,250
intuitive way why the magnetic
field outside maybe zero if

239
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,190
the sheet is infinitely long.

240
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:12,080
It is just my attempt to give
you perhaps some insight so

241
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,170
that you don't feel that
you're sort of

242
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,430
being cheated, perhaps.

243
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,870
Would you agree that right here
at the edge the cylinder

244
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,570
into the paper?

245
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,640
So there is a current going
into the paper.

246
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:27,440
Would you agree that here at
this edge where the cylinder

247
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,820
is coming towards you,
there is a current

248
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,870
coming out of the paper?

249
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,120
By convention, if there's a
current going into the paper

250
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,640
the magnetic field
is down here.

251
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,780
The magnetic field is
up here, and the

252
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,050
magnetic field is up here.

253
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,650
Now imagine that this
was an infinite

254
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,060
sheet, which it's not.

255
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,030
Then 'B' and 'B' and 'B' would
have the same magnitude,

256
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,950
except that the directions
are different.

257
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,840
I can do the same for
this current.

258
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,250
The 'B' would now be
pointing upwards.

259
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,860
The 'B' here would also
be pointing upwards.

260
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,540
But on the left side the 'B'
would be pointing downwards.

261
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,300
And you see that you get outside
0, and that inside the

262
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,080
two magnetic fields, due to do
this current going into the

263
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,730
paper and this current coming
out of the paper,

264
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:19,040
support each other.

265
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,110
Very similar to what we had
earlier when we had very large

266
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:30,380
capacitor plates, very large in
size, linear size 'l' here

267
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,480
much larger than the
distance 'd'.

268
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,240
We had positive charge here,
negative charge here.

269
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,360
Remember, for the same
reason 'E' was 0

270
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,140
here, 'E' was 0 there.

271
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,660
And the electric field inside of
the two plates support each

272
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,920
other and was 'sigma' divided
by 'epsilon 0'.

273
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,670
Superposition principle
again, in case of

274
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,730
very, very large plates.

275
00:15:57,730 --> 00:15:59,159
