1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,410

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:14,600
Here we have a long wire with
a circular cross section.

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,680
It has a radius 'R'.

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,740
There is a current going into
the wire in this direction,

5
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:26,850
but the current density
is not uniform.

6
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:30,020
In other words, per square
centimeter more current flows

7
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,230
here then what flows there.

8
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,600
It is a linear relationship.

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,620
'J', which is the current
density, is some constant

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:44,610
alpha times the radius
'r', if this is 'r'.

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:50,710
So you see current density
here is higher than here.

12
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:57,370
Let's make a large cross section
and we have therefore

13
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:05,750
here the radius 'R' and I have
here a concentric circle with

14
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,140
radius little 'r'.

15
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:14,050
And one that is slightly
larger, so that this

16
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,550
thickness is 'dr'.

17
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,710
And I would like to calculate
now with you what is the

18
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:27,250
current going through this
ring, so to speak?

19
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:34,640
Well, that current 'di' at that
location 'r' must be 'J'

20
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,850
at that location 'r' times the
surface area of the ring which

21
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,410
is '2 pi r dr'.

22
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,700

23
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,130
So if I want to know to the
total current that flows is

24
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:57,290
this whole surface area, in
other words up to radius 'r',

25
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:02,750
so 'i' up to radius 'r',
including this whole area,

26
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,990
then I have to do it an
integral, 'r' has to

27
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:11,510
go from 0 to 'r'.

28
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:18,420
And I find '2 pi alpha' times
the integral from 0.

29
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:24,660

30
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,310
Let me first do the integral all
the way from here to here.

31
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,000

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,150
Let me first do 'i total', which
is this total value.

33
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:41,870
That would be then from 0 to
'R', '2 pi alpha' and then you

34
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,420
get 'r squared dr'.

35
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,660
That tells you then that this
equals '2 pi' divided by 3

36
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,400
times alpha times 'R cubed'.

37
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,250
You can write that differently
if you want to.

38
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,280
You can say that alpha therefor
is '3i', this is 'i

39
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,410
total' now.

40
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:04,860
Total current through
the cross section

41
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,170
divided by '2 pi R cubed'.

42
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,070

43
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:14,180
This it's not too difficult.

44
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,190
To get the current the relation
between the current

45
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,060
and alpha, current
going through

46
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,220
this whole cross section.

47
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,770
And now, as you see, I
was getting a little

48
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,230
bit ahead of myself.

49
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,730
Now we want to know what the
magnetic field is at all

50
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,640
values of 'r'.

51
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,530
We have two domains.

52
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:41,800
We have the domain whereby 'r'
is smaller than capital 'R'

53
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,880
and we have the domain where it
is larger than capital 'R'.

54
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:51,030
I suggested you do this one
and I will do this one.

55
00:03:51,030 --> 00:04:00,520
Here is the cross section,
radius 'R'.

56
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,570
And I'm now going to
apply Ampere's law.

57
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,490

58
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:10,340
So I have here a closed loop.

59
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:18,255
Remember Ampere's law that
connects a closed looped, this

60
00:04:18,255 --> 00:04:20,990
is a closed loop that
you must choose.

61
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:29,870
Equals 'mu0' times 'i thru' And
that 'i thru' is through a

62
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:40,330
surface, which is an open
surface attached

63
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,760
to the closed loop.

64
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,050

65
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,400
And this is that closed loop.

66
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,130
Whether it's a floppy
surface, bulged or

67
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,630
flat, doesn't matter.

68
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,430
That's the amazing thing
about this law.

69
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,720
I will choose a flat
surface, not making

70
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,150
our lives too difficult.

71
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:08,620
And so the current 'i' that goes
through this area, that's

72
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,470
why I put an 'r' in here, that's
through the area up to

73
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:19,040
radius little 'r' immediately
follows from what we just did.

74
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,170
Alpha 'r cubed',
this is alpha.

75
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:28,520
This is also the same as 'i',
the total 'i' 'r cubed'

76
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,110
divided by capital 'R cubed'.

77
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,630
Now if we apply Ampere's law,
and we go around in this a

78
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,550
circle the magnetic fields by

79
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:47,300
convention is in this direction.

80
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,150
It's everywhere the same because
the radius 'r', little

81
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:55,780
'r', doesn't change and so we
get that 'B' at the distance

82
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:03,690
'r' times '2 pi r' equals 'mu
0' times the current going

83
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,240
through that flat surface,
uniquely determined and that

84
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,730
equals 'i r cubed' divided
'R cubed'.

85
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:18,050
And out pops immediately 'Br'.

86
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,165
And what you see is that 'Br'
proportional to 'r squared'.

87
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:26,860

88
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,200
If the current density had been
the same throughout the

89
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,460
whole surface, not linearly
growing with 'r', but the

90
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,360
same, then you would have found
that the magnetic field

91
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,640
inside the wire would
have grown linearly.

92
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:49,260
0 at the center and growing
linearly to the outer radius.

93
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,890
No it's grows in a
quadratic way.

94
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,550
In a parabolic fashion.

95
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,400
It think you should try to
convince yourself that it's

96
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,860
linear if the current density
had been constant throughout.

97
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,070

98
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:10,350
Now when you are going to do
your part to calculate 'B of

99
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:16,270
r' for 'r' larger than 'R',
there is one thing--

100
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,500
it's really not so difficult.

101
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,860
I really get the part I believe
that is more difficult

102
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,240
than what you have to do.

103
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,510
But I want you to check that
your result is exactly

104
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:32,230
identical to my result when
you substitute little 'r'

105
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:34,130
equals capital 'R'.

106
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,240
The two must be the same.

107
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,480
So please check that.

108
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,870
Those consistency checks
are important, they

109
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,320
don't cost very much.

110
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,470
They give you some confidence
in your results.

111
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,465
