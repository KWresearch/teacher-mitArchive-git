1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,970
PROFESSOR: We have a cylindrical
conductor, with an

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,590
inner core which is metal.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,080
Radius 'a'.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:24,520
And we have an outer cylinder,
which has a certain thickness,

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,770
which is not 0.

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,340

8
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:33,540
This radius is 'b', and
this radius is 'c'.

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,790
And this is metal.

10
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,720

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:45,110
And there's a current going
into the direction of the

12
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:50,160
paper, in here, in this inner
core, which call 'i1'.

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,670
And for now there is also a
current flowing in the outer

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,600
shell, which is 'i2', and they
are in the same direction.

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,790
You're being asked now what
is the magnetic field

16
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,530
everywhere in space.

17
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,950
Well thank goodness that we
don't have to use Biot and

18
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:10,480
Savart, because we have a very
long, infinitely long wire.

19
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,250
So we're going to use
Ampere's law.

20
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,660
But I want to talk a little
bit about Ampere's law.

21
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,630
Ampere's law says that the
closed loop integral 'b dot

22
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:38,740
dl' over a close loop equals
'mu 0' times 'i' and 'i' is

23
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:48,280
through an open surface
attached to that loop.

24
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,540
I cannot stress this enough,
because almost all books,

25
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,960
really explain this
incorrectly.

26
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,950
The correct way of thinking
about it is the following: you

27
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,060
draw a closed loop in space.

28
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,036
I don't care how crooked
that loop is.

29
00:02:07,036 --> 00:02:10,190
It doesn't have to be
a perfect circle.

30
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,450
You attach to that loop
an open surface.

31
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,100
It could be flat, it could be
so bubbled that you blow out

32
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,440
so that b gets to the
form of a hat.

33
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,390
There is a surface
which is open.

34
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,920
You can stick your hand in
through the loop, and you get

35
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,230
into this blown up surface.

36
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,890
But it is open.

37
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,570
You don't have to break
through the

38
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,820
surface to get inside.

39
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,260

40
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,160
Once you have done that, it
is immediately clear which

41
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,180
current cuts through
that surface

42
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,340
that is uniquely defined.

43
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,290
Anything else about currents
going through

44
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,970
a loop is ill defined.

45
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,470
I don't like it.

46
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,570
I really don't like it.

47
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:01,600
So if I had a particular
situation whereby I would

48
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,720
choose this to be my closed
loop, and you are perfectly

49
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,720
free to choose the surface.

50
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,210
Flat.

51
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,580
Then it's very easy to determine
whether there is

52
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,860
something poking through
that flat surface.

53
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,320
But here you see a bag.

54
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,320
And I have here a closed
loop at the end.

55
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,000
I hope you can see that.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,660
This is a closed loop.

57
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,780
It's a wire here,
it's a string.

58
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,610

59
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,900
I have attached to it
an open surface.

60
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,170
This whole bag is
an open surface.

61
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,880
And I can stick my
hand in here.

62
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,650
And even if I make it much
smaller, and it's still open

63
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,160
here, I can still stick
my hand in here.

64
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,650
This could be now my loop,
and this crazy

65
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,810
thing could be my surface.

66
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,540
It's an open surface.

67
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,930
And if there is a current going
through here this is the

68
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,140
wire, then it's very clear that
this current is going

69
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,020
through loop.

70
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,750
Here look.

71
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:09,530
It's very clear.

72
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,340
There's no doubt.

73
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,890
There is a wire going
through here.

74
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,870
It's coming in here and
it's coming out here.

75
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,240
It's uniquely determined.

76
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,030
And I'm not talking about a
current going through a loop.

77
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,650
it stinks, I don't like it.

78
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,390
It has to go through
a surface.

79
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,560
Perhaps some of you have seen
these wonderful Japanese

80
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,860
papers balloons.

81
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,770
They have a little opening here,
no larger than a dime.

82
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,020
I can blow it up.

83
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:48,140

84
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,590
OK.

85
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,595
This little opening, that
you can see here.

86
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:54,100

87
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:00,670
This little opening here think
of this as a little loop.

88
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,890
It's very small, but
it's still a loop.

89
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,290
And the surface attached to
it is an open surface.

90
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,470
When there's a current going
through that open

91
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,420
surface I will know.

92
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,800
If the current flows in and
flows out again, of course,

93
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,620
then one is positive and
the other is negative.

94
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,220
I'm not going to poke a hole
through this beautiful

95
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,110
balloon, by the way.

96
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,930
I'm going to leave it as that.

97
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,410
You get the picture about the
meaning of Ampere's law.

98
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,800
And now we have to calculate
what the magnetic field is

99
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,260
everywhere in space.

100
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,630
That's not so difficult.

101
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:44,490
I will make a loop, a concentric
loop, concentric

102
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,890
circle, with radius 'r'.

103
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,730
The magnetic fields I know
by convention is in this

104
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,660
direction and it's tangentially
going around.

105
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,430
I know it's everywhere the same
because the distance 'r'

106
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,380
is the same to this circle.

107
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,290
So I can write down immediately
that 'B' times '2

108
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:13,100
pi r', I don't have to worry
about the dot product because

109
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:18,820
'B' and 'dl' are in the same
direction 'dl' is not in the

110
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,710
direction of the current,
by the way.

111
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,860
'dl' is along this line
in Ampere's law.

112
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,850
So they are in the same
direction, so the cosine

113
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,280
between the angle is 1.

114
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,880
This now equals 'mu 0' times the
current that cuts through

115
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,340
an open surface that I attached
to this line.

116
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,470
Why not just making
a flat one?

117
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,490
I don't have to get myself
a hard time.

118
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,840
Making a flat one.

119
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,560
Then the current that goes
through here is 'i1'.

120
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,020
And there it is.

121
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,410
And so out pops immediately that
in the case that 'r' is

122
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:57,490
smaller than 'b' and larger than
'c', that the magnetic

123
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:04,350
fields falls off again as '1/r',
which is no surprise '2

124
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,830
pi' over 'r'.

125
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:11,850
If, however, I have also a
current 'i2' flowing also in

126
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:16,000
the same direction as 'i1', and
I want to know now what

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,050
the magnetic field is larger
than 'c', outside here.

128
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,910
Again I make a circular loop and
I go through exactly the

129
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,990
same exercise of Ampere's law
and now, no surprise, I will

130
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:35,610
find that 'B' equals 'mu
0' divided by '2 pi r'.

131
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,640
But now I have here
'i1' plus 'i2'.

132
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,930
If 'i1' and 'i2' are the same
in magnitude but in opposite

133
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,810
directions, then obviously
the net result will be 0.

134
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:57,510
I'd like to make a drawing, a
graph, which is always nice.

135
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,600
'B' versus 'r'.

136
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,550
Here is 'r'.

137
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,390
Here is 'B'.

138
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:10,280
Let this be 'a', let this
be 'b', and this be 'c'.

139
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,760
What happens from 0 to 'a',
it's a big question mark.

140
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,870
We have not discussed that.

141
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,210
But you will see that
in the future.

142
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:24,210
Right here at this point 'a' the
magnetic field equals 'mu

143
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:31,240
0' times 'i1' divided
by '2 pi a'.

144
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:42,310
It will fall as '1/r', there it
goes, proportional to '1/r'

145
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,320
and right here at this location
it will have the

146
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:53,570
value 'mu 0' times 'i1'
divided by '2 pi b'.

147
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,520
'1/r'.

148
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,490
What happens here in this
metal we don't know yet.

149
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,230
But you will learn
about that later.

150
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,280
I know that the magnetic
field here--

151
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,300

152
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:13,010
well I know it mathematically
this 'mu 0' times 'i1' plus

153
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,880
'i2', assuming that they run in
the same direction, divided

154
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,770
by '2 pi c'.

155
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,690
Remember '1/r'.

156
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,520
Now whether this is larger than
this number or smaller,

157
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,750
or larger than this number or
smaller, I do not know.

158
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,210
That depends on 'c' and
'b' and on 'i2'.

159
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,860
So what I'm going to draw
now is rather arbitrary.

160
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:41,166
Let's say it's this high and
it falls off as '1/r'.

161
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:45,800
it's interesting for you to
think about now already what

162
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,900
it is doing in here and
what it's doing here.
