1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,240
PROFESSOR: And problem
number 1 is 29-55.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,590
I will be very brief about
this one, because I don't

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,050
think you will have too much
problems with this.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,380
There is a current flowing in
this wire and at 90 degree

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,060
angles the wire continues,
same current 'i'.

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,890
At a distance 'd', in the
extension of this wire there

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,160
is a point 'P', and you are
being asked what is the

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:41,010
magnetic field in strength and
direction at that point 'P'?

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,600
It's clear that it is the
superposition, factorial

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,520
superposition, of the one
due to wire 1 and the

12
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,690
one due to wire 2.

13
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,180

14
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,800
The contribution, due to wire
1 is 0, you can figure that

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,050
out for yourself.

16
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,440

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,530
As far as the contribution from
number 2 is concerned you

18
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,450
could, but I don't think you
should, you could use Biot and

19
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,630
Savart and do the integration
over all these pieces, all the

20
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,250
way from here to infinity.

21
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,970
But that would not be a very
smart thing to do.

22
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,450
What I would do is the
following: I would pretend

23
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,010
that the wire is infinitely
long, even though it isn't,

24
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,870
and then I would calculate the
magnetic field at 'P' using

25
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,690
Ampere's law and divide
the number by 2.

26
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:42,990
The answer by 2.

27
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,260
Because let's face it, if I
extend this wire and pretend

28
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,635
that there is an infinitely long
wire with a current 'i',

29
00:01:50,635 --> 00:01:53,930
it is trivial the calculate
the magnetic field here.

30
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,020
For reasons of symmetry,
obviously if this piece is

31
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,862
missing it has to be
1/2 that value.

32
00:01:59,862 --> 00:02:01,321
