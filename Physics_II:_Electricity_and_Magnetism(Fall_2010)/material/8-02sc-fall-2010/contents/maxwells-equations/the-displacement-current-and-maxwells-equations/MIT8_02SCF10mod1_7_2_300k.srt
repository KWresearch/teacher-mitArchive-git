1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,082
Problem 2 is 29-36.

3
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:22,050
I have a copper wire; I have
a known resistivity.

4
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,330
I have a certain area,
which I know.

5
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,210
I don't know what you want to
call that area, whether you

6
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,670
want to call it pi r squared.

7
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:37,310
It's an area; and it is 4.0
square millimeters.

8
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,480
Let's give it a radius r 0.

9
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,940
There is a current in the
beginning going through, which

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,420
is constant conduction current,
uniformly distributed

11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,820
over the surface
of 30 amperes.

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,880
That's the situation in the
beginning; it's a copper wire.

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,795
And the first question you're
being asked: what is the

14
00:00:56,795 --> 00:01:01,370
electric field inside
the wire itself?

15
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,040
Let us take a random section
of length l.

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,320
Then the resistance, R, of
length l equals rho times l

17
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,960
divided by the cross-sectional
area, which would then be, if

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,360
you accept my r 0, it would
be pi r 0 squared.

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,890

20
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,140
What is the voltage, the
potential difference, if I go

21
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,670
from here to here?

22
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:34,610
That is the integral of E.dl,
so that would be E times l,

23
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:38,340
because I have chosen a distance
l; E and l are in the

24
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,100
same direction.

25
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,530
E is constant, the dot
disappears, so I get El; but

26
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:47,090
according to Ohm's Law, it is
also the conduction current

27
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,380
times the resistance over
that distance l.

28
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,150
And so what do I find
when I combine that?

29
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,630
I find that the electric field
inside is the conduction

30
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,710
current times rho divided
by the area, which

31
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,760
is the pi r 0 squared.

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,100
And this, of course, is
independent of little l; it

33
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,100
better be independent of little
l, because clearly

34
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,900
Maxwell's equations doesn't
give a damn, so to speak,

35
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,300
about what you choose for l.

36
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,260
It has to be independent of l.

37
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,450
So, here, you see, that if I put
in the numbers-- but don't

38
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,530
take my numbers always too
seriously, because I can

39
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,280
easily make mistakes--

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:35,220
I found, sticking in the
numbers, 0.15 volts per meter.

41
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,340
Now you're being asked,
what is dE/dt.

42
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,290
Well, you will say there is no
dE/dt, because the current is

43
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:43,950
a constant.

44
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,365
Ah, but they are going to sneak
on you, that now they

45
00:02:48,365 --> 00:02:53,720
are going to increase the
conduction current with a huge

46
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,660
amount: 6,000 amperes
per second.

47
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,910
So what is now dE/dt?

48
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,200

49
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,360
Well, that's the derivative
of this thing.

50
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,545
So that is rho divided by
the area times dIc/dt.

51
00:03:12,545 --> 00:03:15,330

52
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,670
And you know that,
that is 6,000.

53
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,190
If I stick in the numbers--

54
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,250
I may well have made
a mistake--

55
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,770
I find 30 volts per meter per
second will be my answer.

56
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:31,630

57
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,310
That's right; that's dE/dt.

58
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:42,810
Now if we were charging, or
if we were discharging a

59
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,730
capacitor, there would also be
a second derivative of dE/dt

60
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,090
--of E versus time, I should
say, second derivative of the

61
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,300
electric flux through
the surface.

62
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,640
That, however, is not
the case now.

63
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,390
You may say, well, that's
strange because

64
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,270
the current is changing.

65
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:06,270
Well, but you're not charging
up a capacitor; you're not

66
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,200
building up a charge on
a plate, so you're not

67
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,220
increasing the electric field.

68
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,170
At least you are not, you are
increasing the electric

69
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,110
field-- that's what you're
doing-- but you don't have a

70
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,930
second derivative of
the electric field.

71
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,660
So if this were a capacitor,
and you were charging a

72
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,000
capacitor with a changing
conduction current; then as

73
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,150
you will see, you will get
a d2 E dt squared,

74
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,960
but here you won't.

75
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,470
So this one equals constant,
even though you have a

76
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,750
changing conduction current.

77
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,620
Having recognized that, you,
now, are being asked to

78
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,030
calculate the displacement
current.

79
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,130
Well, the displacement current,
again, they don't

80
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,720
specify the surface; it's pretty
sloppy of the authors,

81
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,610
but I would assume that they
mean the total one.

82
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,860
That means the displacement
current going through the

83
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,400
cross-section, the flat surface
of the copper wire.

84
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,560
So it's epsilon 0, it is
dE/dt times that area,

85
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,840
which, pi r 0 squared.

86
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:23,320
The dot product disappears,
because the area, the dA's and

87
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,590
dE's are in the same
direction.

88
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,560
And so, you will find now--

89
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,660

90
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,780
dE/dt you calculated, 30 volts
per minute per second.

91
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:42,900
So you find a number; if I
calculate the displacement

92
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,960
current density, then
I even lose my area.

93
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,900
I get epsilon 0 times dE/dt,
and if I did not make a

94
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,020
mistake, which I could easily
have done, I find 2.65 times

95
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,710
10 to the minus 10 amperes
per square meter.

96
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:06,820
Now look at this number; this is
an extremely small number,

97
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:13,330
and the reason why this second
term of Maxwell's equations is

98
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:19,180
often, but not always, is often
very small, is because

99
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,967
of this epsilon 0, right, which
is this 8.8 times 10 to

100
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:26,200
the minus 12.

101
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,560
But there are cases where
it is not negligible.

102
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,440
You are being, now, asked to
calculate the magnetic field,

103
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,330
B, at a distance r from the
wire, which is 5 centimeters

104
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,995
which is larger than r 0.

105
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:44,120
It doesn't have to be much
larger, it happens to be

106
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,905
larger than r 0, so it's
outside the surface.

107
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:49,820

108
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:58,470
Well, here is that cross-section
of the wire; my

109
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,520
r, which is 5 centimeters.

110
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:09,180
I choose, obviously, a circle,
a concentric circle, and I

111
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,590
have to attach, now,
an open surface.

112
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,240
Well, there is nothing to be
accomplished by being fancy

113
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:22,400
with hats and paper, you know,
shopping bag surfaces; I

114
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,420
would, now, simply go
for this surface.

115
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,160
That's all there is to it.

116
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,490
If I go for this surface,
remember that only through

117
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:40,430
this surface is there a changing
electric flux.

118
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:46,080
But keep in mind, if you go
through the integral of B.dr,

119
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,270
so you get B times to 2 pi
r, that the first term of

120
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,230
Maxwell's equation, the
conduction current

121
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,220
term, is not 0.

122
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,670
Neither is the displacement
current term.

123
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,630
I put a mu 0 outside, and I will
calculate the situation

124
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:08,225
when t equals 0, when the
current was 30 amperes.

125
00:08:08,225 --> 00:08:12,780
A little later, of course, the
current is higher, but I will

126
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,940
calculate it at this moment,
so I get a 30, here.

127
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,730
That's a mu 0 times Ic,
a time t equals 0, so

128
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,840
that is t equals 0.

129
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:31,150
Now I have to add epsilon 0
times dE/dt times the area,

130
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:36,820
but it's this area, not this
area, because there is no

131
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,930
changing electric flux going
through this area.

132
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:47,310
So I have, now, times the area
which I will call pi r 0

133
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:54,150
squared, which was, I believe,
this 4 times 10 to the minus 6

134
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,250
square meters.

135
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,990
Well, earlier we calculated
this, which was ridiculously

136
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,520
small, and when you multiply
these two, you get an absurd

137
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,810
number, which is something like
10 to the, of the order

138
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:11,510
of 10 to the minus 15; and so
you see that in this case,

139
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,820
even though the current is
changing with an absurd amount

140
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:21,600
of 6,000 amperes per second,
the magnetic fields at this

141
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,400
location are 5 centimeters, is
exclusively dictated by the

142
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,750
conduction current.

143
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:33,070
And so to a high degree of
approximation, you still get

144
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:39,640
that it is Ic divided
by 2 pi r.

145
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,270
And if I calculated that
correctly, I found 1.20 times

146
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,560
10 to the minus 4 Tesla.

147
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:53,190
That's what I found; and this
is then a t equals 0.

148
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,995
