2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,680
PROFESSOR: Problem number one.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,160
Let's first look at Ampere's
law, which we are going to

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:22,380
need the closed loop integral of
B.dl, I'm not lucky with my

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,630
pens, am I?

6
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,230
This is a good one.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,890
Equals mu zero times I thru
plus, and here comes the

8
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:37,260
famous term by Maxwell, d/dt
integral of E.da .

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,540

10
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,800
And this part, including the
epsilon zero is often called

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,500
the displacement current.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,630
It's essential that you realize
that is a closed loop

13
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:01,250
and that's you must attach to
that closed loop an open

14
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:07,190
surface and you have to do the
calculation of this with that

15
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:10,470
open surface and take
the time derivative.

16
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,530
Now, the problem is
a very cute one.

17
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,760
I have a very small,
very small closed

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,360
loop and a huge balloon.

19
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,080
This is the balloon.

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,310
And there is an opening here.

21
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,650
So it's really a closed loop
and it's an open surface.

22
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,610
And I have such a closed loop
and an open surface here.

23
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,430
My Japanese balloon.

24
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,168
Let me first blow it up.

25
00:01:36,168 --> 00:01:38,310
Here you see it.

26
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,780
You see the opening, I have a
pencil here, and you see you

27
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,570
can go in here, the opening.

28
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,800
So this is that closed loop
and in this problem we're

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,765
going to make this closed
loop go to zero.

30
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:55,170

31
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,630
I have in here a radioactive
source, alpha

32
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,400
particles coming out.

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,410
Alpha particles are two protons
and two neutrons.

34
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,660
There goes these alpha
particles.

35
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,580
So these is a positive current
flowing out, uniformly in all

36
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,040
directions.

37
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,120
Positive charge, positive
correct.

38
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,135
Q, enclosed here becomes
negative and therefore the dQ

39
00:02:19,135 --> 00:02:22,620
/ dt becomes a negative value.

40
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,210
Because if we start with a
neutral radioactive source,

41
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:32,170
then the source becomes
increasingly more negative.

42
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,880
Now, if we're going to close
this gap, we can apply Gauss's

43
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,180
Law, which says that the closed
surface integral of

44
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:49,560
E.dA equals Q enclosed divided
by epsilon zero.

45
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,740
If I make this loop zero, then
this term becomes zero.

46
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:02,390
And so what I have now
is that zero equals--

47
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,900

48
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,820
if you get the mu zero, I
lose it on both sides--

49
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:15,740
equals I thru plus epsilon zero
times d / dt times the

50
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:21,235
integral of the electric flux
through that open surface.

51
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:23,900

52
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,225
Look now, that's this term
here, which is a closed

53
00:03:27,225 --> 00:03:30,630
surface, and this term here,
which is an open surface,

54
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,110
become the same if you
make the loop zero.

55
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:43,350
And so I know find that zero
equals I thru plus, I take the

56
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:50,120
derivative and so this becomes
dQ / dt, I have an epsilon

57
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,800
zero here, and an epsilon zero
here, and so they cancel.

58
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,490
And this is a totally
trivial result.

59
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,640
It is immediately obvious.

60
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,290
What it's telling you is, that
I thru, this closed balloon,

61
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,350
equals minus dQ / dt.

62
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,450
Well, we did not Maxwell's
equations to tell us that.

63
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:19,730
The radioactive source is
becoming more and more and

64
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:23,060
more negative, so it's clear
that the current that is going

65
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,200
out through this surface,
by definition is the

66
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,400
charge per unit time.

67
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,140
And the minus sign is only
because the radioactive source

68
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,150
becomes more negative.

69
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,200
The beauty however is, that we
find is absolutely trivial

70
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,340
result, for which we did not
need Maxwell's equations at

71
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,690
all, but is entirely consistent

72
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,740
with Maxwell's equations.

73
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:50,940
And it's only consistent with
Maxwell's equations because we

74
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,760
allowed for this displacement
current term.

75
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,070
If we didn't have this
displacement current term, we

76
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,970
would've found the embarrassing
answer, clearly

77
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:08,160
the wrong answer, that
I thru would be zero.

78
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,530
Which is obviously not true.

79
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:16,320
And so, what I like about this
problem, that it derives in

80
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,770
what you may call a rather
complicated way using Ampere's

81
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,580
Law, including the displacement
term, and derives

82
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,790
in a very complicated way the
answer, which we already knew,

83
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:35,020
mainly that the current
is nothing but the

84
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,420
charge per unit time.

85
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,350
This we could have written
down without thinking.

86
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,270
We could only have found it from
Maxwell's equations, if

87
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:53,470
however we had incorporated
the displacement current.

88
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,150
And that's why I really like
this problem quite a bit.

89
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,240
It's really a marvel
in my opinion.

90
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,295
