1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,940
PROFESSOR: Historic moment:
we're going to discuss,

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:16,930
exclusively, Ampere's Law, as
it was amended by Maxwell.

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:25,620
He is a genius who recognized
that changing electric fields

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,900
can cause a magnetic field.

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,820
We will see some remarkable
examples why that was

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,480
necessary, and out of that, of
course, came this fabulous

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,350
victory of the theory.

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,940
You will see this later in the
course that it not only

10
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,620
predicts the existence of
electromagnetic radiation, but

11
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,120
it even predicts that the
speed of light of all

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,880
electromagnetic radiation is 1
over the square root of mu 0

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,890
times epsilon 0.

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,220
A remarkable victory, and
it turned out that

15
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,720
that's what it was.

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,120
Before I go into the specific
problems, I want to do with

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,930
you a classic, which covers
effectively all conceivable

18
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,400
problems, all conceivable
problems with this new concept

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,780
of displacement current, and
then we'll do the problems.

20
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,760
Let's first write down
the new equation.

21
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:36,850
Closed loop integral of B.dl
equals mu 0 times I thru plus

22
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:49,410
mu 0 times epsilon 0 times
d/dt the integral of E.dA

23
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,330
What does this mean?

24
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:58,280
It means that you must
choose a closed loop.

25
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,960
Any closed loop is fine.

26
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,600
Of course, if you don't choose
a clever loop, the equation

27
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,730
still holds, but it doesn't do
you any good, because you've

28
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,220
gone to introduce symmetry;
otherwise, you

29
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,610
can't solve a problem.

30
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,360
But any loop, in principle,
will do.

31
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,520
Then you attach to that
closed loop an open

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,570
surface; it's open.

33
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,120
Does it have to be flat?

34
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,230
No.

35
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:32,010
It can be a bag, like
a shopping bag.

36
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,150
So this could be the closed
loop, and you could have a

37
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,670
surface like a hat you can put
over your head, and we will do

38
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,200
that today.

39
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,180
I thru is the current that pokes
through that surface.

40
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,390
The whole concept of
a current going

41
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:53,880
through a loop is nonsense.

42
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,350
This is an electric flux, and
this is the time derivative of

43
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,930
that electric flux.

44
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,660
And this is the time derivative
of electric flux

45
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,006
going through that
open surface.

46
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:12,960
So now I come with my
classic problem.

47
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,730

48
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,495
Here is my classic problem.

49
00:03:17,495 --> 00:03:20,660
Let's keep this equation
a little bit at hand.

50
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,680

51
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,450
I have a capacitor.

52
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,200
It is not a problem on your
assignment, although you have

53
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,430
similar ones.

54
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,320
Let's assume that the
plates are circular.

55
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,280
That makes it a little easy
to calculate things.

56
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,570
And let's assume that the radius
of the plates is R, so

57
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,415
the area of each plate
is pi R squared.

58
00:03:46,415 --> 00:03:49,340

59
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:59,880
We are charging this capacitor
with a constant current, Ic.

60
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,280
So the inside here becomes
positively charged and is

61
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,980
growing the charge, and so you
get an electric field, which

62
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:19,510
is pointing in this direction,
and this electric field E is

63
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,895
growing in time, because more
and more charge accumulates.

64
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,600

65
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,880
We will make a simplified
assumption that the electric

66
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,410
field is constant between the
capacitor plates; it's not

67
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:39,250
true, but it will be our
assumption and that E outsides

68
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,790
the capacitor equals 0.

69
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,040
We will make that assumption.

70
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,660

71
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,560
Now, I'm asking you
three questions.

72
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,040
What is the magnetic field at
a point P1 at a distance r

73
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:04,680
from the wire, whereby for P1,
r equals larger than R. And I

74
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:11,990
want to know the same for a
point P2, which is inside the

75
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:17,450
capacitor, at least if I have
a plane perpendicular to the

76
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,400
wire, that plane would
completely go between the

77
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,770
capacitor plates.

78
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:28,920
So also for P2, r is larger than
R. And then I'm going to

79
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:34,600
ask you, what is the magnetic
field at point 3, which is at

80
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,660
a distance r from the center
line, whereby r is smaller or

81
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,220
equal than R. You can also
put equal signs here.

82
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,170
That is our goal.

83
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,840
Let's first take P1.

84
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,890
It's completely classic.

85
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:56,470
You don't even need Maxwell's
new equation; you simply take

86
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,500
Ampere's Law.

87
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:05,180
If this is your point P1, you
choose, as your closed loop, a

88
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,030
circle which is completely
symmetric

89
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,830
relative to the wire.

90
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,520
You choose a flat surface; there
is no reason why you

91
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,140
would not do that here.

92
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,600
There is a conduction current
Ic coming in here; and there

93
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,990
is a conduction current
Ic coming out there.

94
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,260
This is a surface, and
the current is

95
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,600
penetrating that surface.

96
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:37,020
If we look from the left, we
know that the magnetic field

97
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,790
will be going around
clockwise.

98
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:41,990
So if I look at the current
going away from me, by

99
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,990
convention, the magnetic field
will be going around in

100
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,010
circles, symmetric about
the central line.

101
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,760
And of course, if I choose a
circle, concentric circle, the

102
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,470
B field will be the same
everywhere, because it has the

103
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:03,270
same distance to the wire:
clockwise when the current

104
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,630
goes away from me,
counterclockwise when the

105
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,700
current comes to me.

106
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,950
It's a convention.

107
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,780
So I don't worry even about
the direction anymore.

108
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,950
I know the direction already,
so I don't even worry about

109
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,015
signs too much.

110
00:07:15,015 --> 00:07:18,750
I am only interested, now,
in the magnitude.

111
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:23,740
So I apply Ampere's Law.

112
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:29,330
There is no changing electric
flux going through this

113
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:32,280
surface, which I have
here, so I'm only

114
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,640
dealing with this term.

115
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:40,150
This term is 0; this is the only
term I have. So I get B

116
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:46,430
times 2 pi r equals mu 0 times
the conduction current, and we

117
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,660
get a result that we have
seen before: mu 0 Ic

118
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,860
divided by 2 pi r.

119
00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:01,310
Magnetic field falls off as 1
over r, and seen from the left

120
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,460
sides, it goes around
clockwise.

121
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,200

122
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,690
Now let's go to point P2.

123
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,350

124
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:19,150
With point P2, I'm going to make
exactly the same; I will

125
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:26,760
have, here, capacitor plates;
here are the current wires;

126
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,800
here is point P2.

127
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,790
Again, I'm going to make the
circle, concentric circle, and

128
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:39,980
the radius here is r;
this is point P2.

129
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,160
I now have a choice; well,
I have lots of choices.

130
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:47,340
But I have, now, two obvious
choices for the surface, open

131
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,600
surface attached to the loop.

132
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:57,210
One would be this; and another
one would be this.

133
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:04,510

134
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,960
It's like a shopping bag;
it's open here.

135
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,810
I can stick my hand in here,
and here is the surface.

136
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,310
This is that surface.

137
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:17,540
In the first case, I have no
contribution due to the

138
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,790
conduction current, because
there is no current going

139
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,350
through this, no conduction
current.

140
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:28,370
In the second case, here, this
term is 0; by the way, this

141
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,530
term has a name.

142
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:36,180
We call this term the
displacement current; it is a

143
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,902
misnomer, but that's
what it's called.

144
00:09:38,902 --> 00:09:43,850
It has the same dimension
as I thru: Ampere's.

145
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,680
There is no displacement current
going through the

146
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,820
surface, but there is only going
a conduction current

147
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,360
going through that surface.

148
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,620
Whether I'd apply a flat surface
or this back surface,

149
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,100
I should get the same answer.

150
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:06,650
Well, be my guest. I don't care
which one we do first.

151
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:10,500
Let's first do the
back surface.

152
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:16,250
If we do the back surface; then
we get B times 2 pi r--

153
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,180
closed loop integral
along this line--

154
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,950
equals mu 0 times the conduction
current poking

155
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:28,300
through this surface, which is
Ic, and there is no changing

156
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,710
electric field anywhere going
through this surface, because

157
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:37,200
remember E will zero here; and
we have assumed that the E

158
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,700
will zero here, outside
the capacitor.

159
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,460
And this is open here.

160
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,160
There is no surface here.

161
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,860
So what do you find?

162
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:50,090
B equals mu 0 time Ic
divided by 2 pi r.

163
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,730
You find exactly the same
result that you

164
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,570
found for point P1.

165
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:00,740
So this is r larger than R or
equal to R, and you are in the

166
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,440
plane between the capacitors.

167
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,430
You are at point P2--

168
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:11,460
exactly the same result, and
that shouldn't surprise you.

169
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:19,510
Now we're going to use this
surface as our open surface

170
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,890
attached to this wire.

171
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,640
And we better get the same
results, but now the

172
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,560
calculation is a little
bit more complicated.

173
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:36,310
I have an electric field, and
the electric field is running

174
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:42,030
from left to right,
and it is growing.

175
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,820
And the reason why it is growing
is that the charge

176
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,950
that piles up here is, of
course, increasing.

177
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,010
If the current were constant,
then it is

178
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:55,350
increasing linearly in time.

179
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,420
What is that electric field?

180
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:02,090
Well, that electric field is
sigma, which is the surface

181
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:05,680
charge density divided by
epsilon 0, and it is

182
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,790
increasing in time, so surely
dE dt is not going to be 0.

183
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,765
In fact, dE dt is going
to be a constant.

184
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:18,940

185
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:25,410
Well, how do I calculate, now,
the changing electric flux

186
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,060
through this surface?

187
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,530
I'm going to make a slightly
different drawing.

188
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:36,850
This is a circle with radius
capital R, so that's the

189
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:41,570
capacitor plates, and this
is the circle through

190
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,760
which point P2 goes.

191
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,710
And outside the capacitor
plates, E equals 0, and inside

192
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:54,660
the capacitor plates, if I look
from right to left, I see

193
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,780
a constant but growing E field,
and this, now, is my

194
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,030
flat surface.

195
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,040

196
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:08,390
And there is no conduction
current going through here.

197
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:16,010
Now I have to do the closed
loop integral of B.dl --B

198
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:22,590
times 2 pi r equals
mu 0 epsilon 0,

199
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,470
d/dt integral E.dA--

200
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,680

201
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,620
And this is the surface, and
E and dA are in the same

202
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,900
direction, so I can immediately

203
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,900
drop the dot product.

204
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,730
What is E as a function of t,
between the capacitor plates.

205
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:43,630
That is sigma, which is changing
with t divided by

206
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:49,510
epsilon 0, which is the charge
divided by epsilon 0 times the

207
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:55,330
area between the plates,
which is pi R squared.

208
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,500
Q of t is growing linearly in
time; time t equals 0, it is

209
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:05,180
Q0 plus the conduction
current times t.

210
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:14,070
And therefore, dE dt equals dQ
dt divided by epsilon 0 pi r

211
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,860
squared; but dQ dt itself is
the conduction current.

212
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,430
So this is the conduction
current divided by epsilon 0

213
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,820
times pi r squared.

214
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,840
And it is constant here because
I of c, the conduction

215
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,000
current is not changing.

216
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,070
Later today we will see a
problem whereby the conduction

217
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,090
current is changing.

218
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,460
Here it's not; it's constant.

219
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,450

220
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,330
All right, so we are well
on our way, now.

221
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,910
We, now, have to integrate--

222
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,740
we have to calculate
this term.

223
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:57,520
If we take mu 0 epsilon 0, this
term, now, simply becomes

224
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:02,910
dE dt times the area, because
the dots disappear-- they are

225
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,300
the same direction--

226
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,512
times pi r squared.

227
00:15:06,512 --> 00:15:12,040
But we know this; we
just calculated it.

228
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,640
And notice, you have downstairs,
here, epsilon zero

229
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,870
pi r squared, and you
have upstairs, here,

230
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:20,370
epsilon 0 pi r squared.

231
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,130
So what do you get?

232
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:28,760
This term becomes, simply,
mu 0 times I of c.

233
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:36,510
And therefore, your magnetic
field, B, at that location, P2

234
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:40,740
where r is larger than R,
between the capacitor plates

235
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:47,150
equals mu 0 Ic divided by 2 pi
r, and that is exactly what we

236
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,920
found before, and that should
not come as a surprise.

237
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,560
In other words, the induction
current, I of D is exactly the

238
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,530
same as the conduction
current--

239
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,570
actually the displacement
current.

240
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,540
This is the displacement
current; it is the total

241
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,010
displacement current.

242
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:13,520
Total, because I have chosen the
displacement current to go

243
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,370
through this entire
of the surface.

244
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,750
If, later, we are going to
calculate the displacement

245
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,840
current through a smaller flat
surface, then it will, of

246
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,890
course, be smaller.

247
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:28,070
But in this case, the total
displacement current going

248
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,500
through this surface, which
covers the entire surface of

249
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,870
the capacitor plates, that
displacement current is the

250
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,810
same as the conduction
current.

251
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,990
And that, of course, is a
requirement, because if not,

252
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:44,480
you would never see the same
answer for the magnetic field

253
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,700
at point P2, whether you take
the bag surface or whether you

254
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,250
take the flat surface.

255
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,990
So you had a choice: the bag
surface or the flat surface;

256
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:57,720
it's clear that the bag surface
goes a little faster.

257
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,650
But in any case, you see
we get the same answer.

258
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:06,570
So now what we have left: we
have left the magnetic field

259
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:12,100
between the capacitor plates for
a radius, which is smaller

260
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,240
than the radius of the plates.

261
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,200
So here, we have the plates;
now, we have a

262
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,810
radius little r.

263
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,970
Of course, our closed group
integral is, again, going to

264
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,500
be a concentric circle.

265
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,590
We have a conduction current
going in here, and we have a

266
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:37,590
conduction going in here, and
we have, here, in between a

267
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,850
growing electric field.

268
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,970

269
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:48,000
And now, you may think that
you have options about the

270
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,900
choice of the surface that you
attach to this closed loop.

271
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,580
It's true, you have an option.

272
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,580
If you think you're going to be
very clever, you may choose

273
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:04,320
a surface which runs parallel
here to E, then curves like a

274
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,630
shopping bag and, here, runs
parallel to E. So it's open;

275
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,336
it's an open surface, here.

276
00:18:11,336 --> 00:18:13,430
You can stick your hand in.

277
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:17,800
And you may say that the
electric flux going through

278
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:23,200
this portion is 0 because
E is parallel to dA--

279
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,510
excuse me, is perpendicular to
dA, because dA would be in

280
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,360
this direction, E is in this
direction, so the dot product

281
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,000
would disappear.

282
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,800
So you will say, "Aha, all I
deal with is the current

283
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,160
coming out here." But
that's not true.

284
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,580
Because as a current charges up
this plate, there is also

285
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,080
current going up in this
direction, and there is

286
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,430
current going onto the
plate like this.

287
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,270
Therefore, there is current
going down here, and there is

288
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,660
current coming down from
the plate, here.

289
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,960
And that current is penetrating
this surface, and

290
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,580
you would have to take
that into account.

291
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,000
Now if you find an easier way to
calculate that current, be

292
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,970
my guest, and I'm sure you'll
get the right answer.

293
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:07,630
I prefer not to do
it this way.

294
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:12,470
Now you may be clever and say,
"Aha, now I'm going to choose

295
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:18,450
a surface, which is completely
bypassing the plates and which

296
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:24,760
goes like this." Wonderful.

297
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,750
I have here now, conduction
current penetrating through

298
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:30,080
the surface, here.

299
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,760
But, what do I have here?

300
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,950
Ah!

301
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:36,760
Through this part of the
surface, and through this part

302
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,650
of the surface, as long as I'm
inside the capacitor, there is

303
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:44,600
a changing electric flux, which,
now, I have to take

304
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,060
into account.

305
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,150
So not only is the second term
of Maxwell's equation not

306
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:52,210
zero, due to this conduction
current--

307
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,570
excuse me, not only is the
first term not 0, but the

308
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,190
second term is not 0 either.

309
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,250
And so I have to calculate both,
and I have to take the

310
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,000
dot product into account
of E dot dA (E.dA).

311
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,380
I have to take, therefore--

312
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,820
to calculate, again, the
displacement current, so why

313
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,680
do it that way.

314
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,990
I would suggest, here, that
we take a flat surface.

315
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,990
If we take a flat surface, we
have nothing to do with the

316
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,990
conduction current; we're
only stuck with the

317
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,530
displacement current.

318
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:25,350
And I suggest that that's the
way we're going to do it.

319
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,980
So now, I'm going to suggest
that we use this flat surface.

320
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,550
We have to calculate the
displacement current anyhow.

321
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:37,110
We have already calculated that,
and so that I'm going to

322
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:44,050
use to calculate the magnetic
field at that point briefly.

323
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,770
So what do I find?

324
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,690
I find B times 2 pi r; this
holds, now, for r or less than

325
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:57,380
R, inside the capacitor equals
epsilon 0 times mu 0 times dE

326
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:02,990
dt times pi little r squared.

327
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,380
Why little r squared?

328
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:09,580
Because the flat surface
here has a surface

329
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,980
area pi little r squared.

330
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:18,260
This distance here is little
r, which is smaller than

331
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:22,330
capital R, and so if I apply the
second term of Maxwell's

332
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:24,570
equations, it is that
area that I have

333
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,930
to take into account.

334
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:30,440
But we already calculated
dE dt.

335
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,790
We just did that.

336
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:39,410
That was, if I recall, Ic
divided by epsilon 0 times pi

337
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,190
capital R squared.

338
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,030
So what do I find?

339
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:52,470
I find epsilon 0 mu 0 Ic,
divided by epsilon 0 pi R

340
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:58,270
squared, times pi little
r squared, and that is

341
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,990
B times 2 pi r.

342
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:09,480
This r vanishes; I lose a
pi; I lose an epsilon 0.

343
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,650
And I find that, inside the
capacitor, B equals mu 0 times

344
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:21,260
the conduction current times
r divided by 2 pi capital R

345
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:28,380
squared, the surface area of the
plates of the capacitor,

346
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,760
and what you see here--

347
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,350
this by the way only holds when
r is smaller or equal

348
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:37,805
than R and it is inside
the capacitor.

349
00:22:37,805 --> 00:22:40,370

350
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,320
Notice that it is proportional
to r.

351
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,250
It doesn't fall off as 1
over r, but is linearly

352
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,940
proportional with r.

353
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:54,130
When you substitute, in here,
r equals R, you better find

354
00:22:54,130 --> 00:23:00,170
exactly the same result that you
would have found for P2.

355
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,870
If you bring P2 just to the
point where little r is

356
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:08,416
capital R; the two
must be the same.

357
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:15,290
If you stick in here capital
R, notice that you get B

358
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:21,135
equals mu 0 times I of c divided
by 2 pi times capital

359
00:23:21,135 --> 00:23:25,660
R, and that is, indeed, exactly
the same that you

360
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:30,320
would have found if you look
at your solution for P2 and

361
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,190
you substitute r equals R.

362
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:38,320
The direction of the B fields
in all three cases is

363
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:44,495
clockwise when you look from
the left and you see the

364
00:23:44,495 --> 00:23:48,580
current going away from
you, and here are

365
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,010
the capacitor plates.

366
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:57,990
So when you look at the
capacitor, these are the

367
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:02,726
capacitor plates, and you
are looking away--

368
00:24:02,726 --> 00:24:07,690
the current going away from
you-- this E field is growing;

369
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,210
then you would see
magnetic fields

370
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,270
here circulating around.

371
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:20,870
It would reach a maximum
at a smaller circle.

372
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,670
This B field is smaller, and
right in the center the B

373
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,520
field equals 0, because
it grows linearly

374
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,770
with a little r.

375
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,010

376
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:42,950
So I suggest that I make a plot
of B versus r; this is b.

377
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:49,360
Let's first do that for
r outside the wire.

378
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,170
Let's give the wire an arbitrary
radius of little a;

379
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,320
if you make it 0, then the
magnetic field goes to

380
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,800
infinity; and this
is the radius of

381
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,530
the capacitor plates.

382
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:06,150
So you will get, here, then,
the magnetic field, which

383
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:13,210
falls off as 1 over r, and this
whole curve has the shape

384
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:21,950
mu 0 I conduction divided by 2
pi over r, and it stops here

385
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,710
at the surface.

386
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,520
When you're talking about in
between the capacitor plates,

387
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,550
then you can go to r equals 0.

388
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:35,416
B equals 0, as r equals 0.

389
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:40,690
It goes linearly, and then it
falls off in exactly the same

390
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:46,070
way as it did before, so this
part of the curve, here, is

391
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:49,680
exactly the same as that
part of the curve.

392
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:57,380
And right here, if you take
this curve, and you take r

393
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:01,810
equals capital R, or if you take
this curve, and you take

394
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:05,360
little r equals capital R, you
will find exactly the same

395
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,090
result as I just showed you.

396
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:10,540
You find this result with the
capital R downstairs.

397
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,280

398
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,600
Now, we have effectively dealt
with all conceivable problems

399
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,310
that you can encounter with
displacement current.

400
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:23,890
The only thing we haven't done,
which will not add at

401
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:29,110
all to the complication, is we
have not had a situation

402
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:32,170
whereby we charge or discharge
a capacitor

403
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,510
with a changing current.

404
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,870
You will see that it doesn't
make the situation any more

405
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,620
difficult, because you can
calculate at all moments in

406
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,740
time dE dt.

407
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,970
And therefore, you can calculate
the second term of

408
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,730
Maxwell's equations.

409
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,340
Now, the fact that there happens
to be also a second

410
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:55,540
derivative of E versus t--

411
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,166
namely, if you have a
d2 E dt squared--

412
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:02,400
will not make the calculations
any more difficult.

413
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:02,556
