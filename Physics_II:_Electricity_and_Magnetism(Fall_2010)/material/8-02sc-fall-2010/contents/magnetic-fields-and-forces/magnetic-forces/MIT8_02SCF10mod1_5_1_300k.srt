1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,020
PROFESSOR: So let's start
with problem number

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:15,660
one, which is 28-15.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,940
An electron is going around in
half a circle, this is the

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,270
center of the circle.

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,190
I call this point 'A' and I call
this point 'D', to avoid

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:35,880
confusion with 'B', and the
electron right here has a

8
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,660
velocity 'v'.

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,800
We know that the electron
follow this trajectory,

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,295
therefore there must be the
centripetal force acting on

11
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:53,130
the electron everywhere
in orbit,

12
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,270
pointing towards the center.

13
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:02,170
The direction changes but the
magnitude does not change.

14
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,190
What should be the direction
of the magnetic field to

15
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:09,060
accomplish this arc?

16
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:20,660
Well, the force equals 'q'
times ''v' cross 'B''.

17
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,570
'v' is the velocity of the
electron, 'B' is that magnetic

18
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,380
field that we're interested in,
and 'q' is the charge of

19
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,290
the electron.

20
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,990
Keep in mind that this
is negative.

21
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,350

22
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,980
When you take that into account
it will not be too

23
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,330
difficult to convince you that
the only way that this could

24
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,810
happen is if the magnetic field,
which you are being

25
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,430
told is uniform everywhere
otherwise it wouldn't go

26
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,120
through a perfect circle, by the
way, is perpendicular to

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,160
the paper and it's
in the paper.

28
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,670
So we already the direction.

29
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,130
So we're not concerned
about that.

30
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,740
Now we want to know
the magnitude.

31
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,560

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,670
'q' times ''v' cross 'B'', but
I can really write 'vB',

33
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:18,370
because the cross product
implies the sine of theta,

34
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,820
theta being the angle between
the velocity and the magnetic

35
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:26,880
field, but that is 90 degrees,
so that is 1, so I don't have

36
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,510
to worry about that.

37
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,910
This is the force, this is the
magnitude of the force that

38
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:40,590
you see here, and that is also
mv squared divided by 'R'.

39
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,890
If 'R' is the radius
off the circle.

40
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,860
Notice that is 'v' does not
change during this trajectory,

41
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,350
for the simple reason that
the force is always

42
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,850
perpendicular to 'v'.

43
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:57,570
Because notice this is a cross
product, so the force is both

44
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,950
perpendicular to 'v' and
perpendicular to 'B'.

45
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,180
It's also perpendicular
to 'v'.

46
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,930
Since the work that you do on
this electron is the integral

47
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:15,600
of 'F' dot 'ds', and since these
two are perpendicular to

48
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,660
each other, if I move a little
bit here, over a certain

49
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,380
element ds, the force is always
perpendicular, the work

50
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,550
done is zero.

51
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,240
The speed cannot change.

52
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,880
The velocity changes, because
velocity is a vector.

53
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,280
But the speed, there's no
change, so this 'v' is the

54
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,310
same as this 'v'.

55
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,680
And soI lose one 'v', and I find
that 'B' equals the mass

56
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,590
of the electron times that
velocity times the charge of

57
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,010
the electron divided
by the radius.

58
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,790
Since I know the mass of the
electron, I know the velocity,

59
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,920
I know the charge, and I believe
I know the radius, you

60
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,560
can calculate the
magnetic fields.

61
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,340
We already argued that
it is pointing down

62
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,900
perpendicular to the paper.

63
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,550
The time for half a circle,
the time to go from 'A' to

64
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:18,610
'D', is obviously 'pi r' divided
by that velocity.

65
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,220
So I don't think that that
could be a problem.

66
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,770
At all.
