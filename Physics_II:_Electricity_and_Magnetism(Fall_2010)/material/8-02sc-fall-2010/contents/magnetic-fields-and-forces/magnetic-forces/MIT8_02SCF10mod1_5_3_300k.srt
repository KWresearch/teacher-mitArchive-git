1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,320
We are going to problem
number 4.

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,570
Notice, we are going
quite slowly.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,130
We have plenty of time today.

5
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:21,310
I have a wire which has a
certain length, 'l' which is

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,690
0.15 meters.

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,930
And I have a current
in that wire.

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,720
That's a little bit funny,
because you can't have a

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,200
current in a wire with a certain
lenght, because then

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,620
you get pile up of charge.

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,010
Let's assume that the wire
continues here and continues

12
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:43,610
there, but we are only
considering this portion.

13
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,620
We have an 'x y z' coordinate
system.

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,670

15
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,860
Let this be 'y', this 'z' and
this 'x', convince yourself

16
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,430
that it is a right-handed
coordinate system.

17
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,960

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,220
There is 'B' field in space and
you're being given what

19
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,790
'Bx' is, what 'By' is and you
are being given what 'Bz' is.

20
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,500
And you are being asked what
is the force on the wire.

21
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,240

22
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,320
The force on a very small
element, 'dl' of the wire,

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:34,320
that force would be 'df' which
equals 'I' times 'dl cross B'.

24
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,030
That's an immediate consequence
of the 'v cross B'

25
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,720
force that we just discussed.

26
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:45,350
But since here 'dl' and 'v'
always make the same angle

27
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:50,360
with each other, the wire is not
snaking through space, and

28
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,840
'B' is uniform, there is a sign

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,030
theta which is a constant.

30
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,560
It's not 1, it's not minus
1, but it is a constant.

31
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,260
Therefore, if I do the
integrations I could say that

32
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:10,890
the force on that whole
wire 'l' equals 'i'

33
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,300
times 'l' cross 'B'.

34
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,810
So I can take the wire as a
whole, I don't have to worry

35
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,320
about that the angle here is
different from the angle here

36
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,140
between 'dl' and between 'B'.

37
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,270
That's why this simple
result holds.

38
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:33,570
'l' itself equals 'lx' times
the unit vector the 'i'

39
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,470
direction plus 'ly' unit vector
in the 'y' direction

40
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,300
plus 'lz' unit vector in
the 'z' direction.

41
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,970
This is 0.

42
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:50,280
This is 0 because we only have
'l' in the 'y' direction.

43
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,760
Now we have to do the
cross product.

44
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,870

45
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:12,360
The cross product 'F' becomes
'i', 'j', 'k'; 0, 0.15 times

46
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:22,360
'i', 0, 'Bx,' 'By', and 'Bz'.

47
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,300
And this, I'm sure you will be
able to work that out for

48
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,840
yourself, is 0.15, this was the
length 'I' think of the

49
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:40,460
wire, times 'B of z' in the 'x'
direction minus 'B of x'

50
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,820
in the 'z' direction.

51
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,285
So this is the 'x' component,
and this

52
00:03:44,285 --> 00:03:45,660
is is the 'z' component.

53
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,770
And there is no 'y' component
of the force.

54
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,205
If you want to know the
total force, well,

55
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:54,670
you can do that one.

56
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,920
I leave you with that.

57
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,970
