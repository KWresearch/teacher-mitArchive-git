1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040
PROFESSOR: So let's now go
to problem number 2.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,910
And that is 28-23.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:15,032
It's very clever.

5
00:00:15,032 --> 00:00:17,670
A very clever idea.

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,250
We have aluminum ions,
negativity charged.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,550
I presume they're negatively
charged.

8
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,990
So they have an extra
electron.

9
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,800
They could have been positively
charged if you

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,780
strip an electron off, but
this is my assumption.

11
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:37,130
I have here an oven in which I
heat the aluminum and out of

12
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:43,490
this oven, there's an opening
here, come aluminum ions in

13
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:48,660
various directions with
various velocities.

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,550
Large velocities and
small velocities.

15
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:56,210
And right here there's
also a small opening.

16
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:02,630
There is a condensator, here, a
plate which provides me with

17
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,050
a more or less constant
electric

18
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:09,200
field, in this direction.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,670
In addition, I have a magnetic
field 'B', which is pointing

20
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:20,190
in the paper and I assume it
is uniform everywhere.

21
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,720
And now there is a remarkable
consequence of this set up.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:34,650
By adjusting 'E' and 'B', I can
select here aluminum ions

23
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,640
which have a specific
velocity, speed.

24
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,880
I call it 'v' selected.

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,050
How does it work?

26
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:58,090
The force on these ions equals
'q' times 'E' plus 'q' times

27
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,340
'v cross B'.

28
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:06,220

29
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:12,340
If I make the force on these
ions 0, then obviously they

30
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,410
will not be deflected.

31
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:21,270
If the force is not 0, but
constant then they will

32
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,920
probably, if they come in like
this and the force is like

33
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,330
this, they will make a parabola
or they will be

34
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,510
accelerated in one direction.

35
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:37,280
But if this is exactly 0, so
that the net force is 0, then

36
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,130
they will go through
undisturbed.

37
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:47,210
The direction of this force on
a negative charge is upwards.

38
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,930
And the direction of this
force is downwards.

39
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,260
You can easily convince yourself
of that. 'v cross B'.

40
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,350

41
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:01,100
For this to be 0, 'q' cancels.

42
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:10,240
I have that 'v', which is the
selected 'v', equals 'E'

43
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,490
divided by 'B'.

44
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:20,740

45
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,410
If I change 'E', if I increase
'E', then I will

46
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,800
get a higher velocity.

47
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,075
If I decrease 'E', then I
get a lower velocity.

48
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:31,860

49
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:38,000
So this is a very clever way
of selecting the speed.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,920
I should perhaps put the
magnitude here, the speed that

51
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,170
comes out here.

52
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:49,060

53
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:56,700
These selected aluminum ions
come out in a uniform magnetic

54
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,640
field, 'B'.

55
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,460
By the way, the reason why I
ignored this cross is that 'v'

56
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:08,340
and 'B' are perpendicular to
each other, and so I get a

57
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,000
plus or a minus sign due to the
sign of the angle theta.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,130
And I have ignored that.

59
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,020
So I get here that the speed at
which they come out is 'E'

60
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,690
divided by 'B'.

61
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,170
And as I said, by adjusting
'E' and 'B', you can get

62
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,430
various velocities.

63
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:30,950
So now, let's call this point
'A', where they come out.

64
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,500
Now we look at them
more closely.

65
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,140
This is 'A'.

66
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,270
So here come out these selected

67
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,160
velocity aluminum ions.

68
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,600
With a certain velocity 'v'
select, and what do I see?

69
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,600
I see that they go around in a
perfect circle, in this case

70
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,130
half a circle.

71
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:53,760
And the circle has
a radius 'R'.

72
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,090
You're being told that the
magnetic field is everywhere

73
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:00,220
the same as it was before.

74
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,800
Perpendicular to the paper
and in the paper.

75
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,070

76
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,690
In order to make this
trajectory, I need a force,

77
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,500
centripetal force.

78
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,490
Here is that centripetal
force, here is that

79
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,340
centripetal force.

80
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,210
And so I simply get
that 'm v squared'

81
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,900
over 'R' must be 'qvB'.

82
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,635
Again I leave the cross out,
because the sign of theta is

83
00:05:33,635 --> 00:05:37,834
either plus or minus 1.

84
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:40,950
I lose 'v' and what do I find?

85
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:47,450
That the mass equals 'q' times
'v' times 'R' divided by that

86
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:52,320
selected velocity, which itself
was 'E' divided by 'B'.

87
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,280
So I get this simple
relationship.

88
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,390
I know 'q', I know 'B', I
know 'R', I know 'E'.

89
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:03,190
And so I can calculate the mass
of the aluminum ions.

90
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:06,280
And this is what we call
a mass spectrometer.

91
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:12,630

92
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,880
A very clever instrument.

93
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,376
