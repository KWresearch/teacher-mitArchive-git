00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,100
PROFESSOR: Problem number 6.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,080
29-49.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,180
I have here infinity long wire,
which is, of course,

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,490
always very unpractical, and it
is drawing a current 'i1'.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,090

7
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:31,620
And here I have a loop, a
rectangular loop, and this

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,730
distance equals 'r1', and this
distance equals 'r2'.

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:43,980

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,550
This loop itself has a current
going through it, 'i2'.

11
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:55,150

12
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:01,030
And the length of this arm
equals 'l', and the length of

13
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,660
this part of course is
'r2' minus 'r1'.

14
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,710

15
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,470
There is a magnetic field and
that magnetic field is

16
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,150
perpendicular to the
paper, it's in the

17
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,100
paper and it's uniform.

18
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,370
As a result of that each
one of these four--

19
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,310
this magnetic field, by the way,
I was a bit misleading,

20
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,970
is the magnetic field that
results from this current.

21
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,030
So I put a 1 there.

22
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,370
This is 'B1'.

23
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:33,610
So I only am considering the
magnetic field as a result of

24
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,040
the current in this wire.

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,150
So it'll be strong here, and it
will fall off as '1/r' when

26
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,400
I go further out.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,270

28
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,950
Now I want to know what
the forces are

29
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,590
on these four sides.

30
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,430
Well, the force here, and you
should convince yourself of

31
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,680
that, because you're--

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,340

33
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:05,360
just the simple fact that you
know that the force equals 'i'

34
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,980
times 'l cross B', you can
convince yourself that the

35
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:17,880
force here will be down, the
force here will be up, and

36
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,480
these two forces will exactly
cancel each other.

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,690
There will be a force here,
outwards, I call it 'F2'.

38
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,650
And they will be a force here,
inwards, I call it 'F1'.

39
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,170
And these two are not the same,
because they are at

40
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,730
different distance:
'r2' and 'r1'.

41
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,200
So this force is clearly smaller
than this force.

42
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,910
This force is winning.

43
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,640
Because 'F1' must
be larger than

44
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,955
'F2' in terms of magnitude.

45
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:54,010

46
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,450
I now want to calculate what
the magnetic field is as a

47
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,510
function of distance
from this wire.

48
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,730
I use Ampere's Law.

49
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,250
And I will get back to Ampere's
Law later, so even if

50
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,580
you can't follow this answer
right away then you'll see

51
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,250
later how it evolves
using Ampere's Law.

52
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,540
I assume that by now you may
know that the magnetic fields

53
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,870
outside a straight wire
pulls off as '1/r'.

54
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,620

55
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:28,230
So the force 'F1' minus 'F2'
is the force in this

56
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:34,370
direction, will therefore
be 'mu 0' times 'i1'

57
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,060
divided by '2 pi'.

58
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,330
And I have '1 over r1'
minus '1 over r2'.

59
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,320
And that is the force, and there
isn't really much more

60
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,290
that I can add to this.

61
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,850
Wasn't all that difficult.

62
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,240
So the loop wants to move
in this direction.

63
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,366
