1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,550

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,270
Problem number five.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,020
28-57.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:20,120
The torque on a current loop.

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,730
Let's set up again a

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,780
right-handed coordinate system.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,030
Always right-handed.

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,285

9
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:33,270
'x y z'.

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:41,790
And we have a loop, rectangular
loop, which comes

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:51,680
off at an angle and the
angle is theta.

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,570
It's hinging here, frictionless
about the z-axis.

13
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,350
This length is 'l1', and this
length is 'l2', this is also

14
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,840
'l2' and this is also 'l1'.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,710
And somehow, for reasons that I
have not explained, there's

16
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,940
a current flowing in this
directions, the same in this

17
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,250
direction, in this direction,
and in this direction.

18
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,510
This current is 'i'.

19
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,310

20
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,550
We know the total my mass of
this whole thing because you

21
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:26,300
are being told that the mass for
unit length is 0.19 grams

22
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,450
per centimeter.

23
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,650
You know 'l1' and 'l2', so you
can calculate the mass or this

24
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,310
whole thing.

25
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,910
The force on each one of these
individual wires in the

26
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,530
presence of a magnetic
field would be 'i'

27
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,980
times 'l cross B'.

28
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:51,810
And 'B' is given is in
the '+y' direction.

29
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,060
Uniformly throughout.

30
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,240

31
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,970
If you analyze the forces on
each one of these four

32
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,500
elements, and I would like you
to do that on your own, by

33
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,880
carefully evaluating the
direction of 'l cross B'.

34
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,950
'I' is always a little
element in the

35
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:11,110
direction of the current.

36
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:15,340
So 'l dl' would be here.

37
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,970
And the 'dl' would be there.

38
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,200

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,610
Then you should be able to
convince yourself that the

40
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,970
force at the bottom here,
this part here,

41
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,480
is in the 'x' direction.

42
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,550
I'll call it 'F of x'.

43
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:36,660
And therefore right here, it's
the same in magnet I call it

44
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,910
'- x', just to tell you in
which direction it is.

45
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:49,280
This wire here experiences a
force in the '+ z' direction,

46
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,160
and this one experiences a force
in the '- z' direction,

47
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,120
and the two exactly cancel
each other out.

48
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,290
So I don't have to worry
about these two.

49
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,470
But these two do not cancel
each other out.

50
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:05,440
They do cancel each other out
in terms of the sum of all

51
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:13,850
forces being 0, but not the sum
of all torques being 0.

52
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,690

53
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:19,590
So there's a torque
on this system.

54
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:25,130
But yet we know that it
is an equilibrium.

55
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,430
So the only way that it can be
an equilibrium that there is

56
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,380
not a torque, this is a counter-
clockwise torque, it

57
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:37,660
has to be a clockwise torque
to hold it in equilibrium.

58
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:43,520
I'm going to now make a
drawing from the side.

59
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,250
I call this hinge points through
which is z-axis goes

60
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:55,710
'P', this one is 'l1', this
angle is theta and I'm going

61
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:59,080
to draw all the forces in there
that I can think of.

62
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:06,780
This is the total mass off the
loop 'mg', here is that force

63
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,800
'Fx' due to the magnetic
fields and the current.

64
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:16,140
Well there must be here this
force '-x', right?

65
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:20,060
I call it 'F minus x', it's the
same in magnitude as this

66
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,740
one, they cancel
each other out.

67
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,420
But since the sum of all forces
must be 0, according to

68
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,750
Newton, and this hinge point,
there must also be

69
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,360
a force 'mg' up.

70
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,090
So you'll see now that the sum
of all forces is now 0.

71
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:42,030
But know the sum of all
torques is also 0.

72
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,470
It doesn't matter which point
you take, whether you take

73
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,640
this point, this point, this
point, this point, or this

74
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,975
point, or this point, or this
point, the sum of all

75
00:04:50,975 --> 00:04:51,990
torques will be 0.

76
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,600
I might as well choose
this points 'P'.

77
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,160
So I will calculate now for
you the torque relative to

78
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,170
point 'P' which must be 0.

79
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,190
When I am here, there is no
contribution to this force and

80
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,120
this force.

81
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,830
I have a clockwise contribution
due to this one.

82
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,140
So there is this arm
times this force.

83
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:24,100
Now the arm has a length 0.5
'l1' times the sine of theta

84
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,100
times 'mg'.

85
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,700
But that is the clockwise one.

86
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,920
I called this clockwise,
must be equal to the

87
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,750
counter-clockwise, I give them
both a positive sign.

88
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:44,650
And the counter-clockwise is
relative to this point 'P',

89
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,470
this distance times
this force.

90
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:56,930
And this distance is ''l1'
cosine theta' times 'Fx'.

91
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,730
Notice I have one equation
with one

92
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,490
unknown and that is 'Fx'.

93
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,260
Because I know all the
other things. 'l1'

94
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,280
cancels, by the way.

95
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,460
I know say theta.

96
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:13,740
But I also know that 'Fx' equals
'i' times 'l2', mind

97
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,280
you it is the length of this
wire here perpendicular to

98
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,040
'l1', times that magnetic field
'B', which is only in

99
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,440
the y-direction.

100
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,760
I know the magnetic fields,
I know 'l2', I know--

101
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:33,570
I know 'Fx', I know 'i' and I
know 'l2', so out pops the

102
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,240
magnetic field.

103
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,400
So I can calculate the
magnetic field.

104
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,490
Interesting problem.

105
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:47,720
So due to this magnetic field,
this loop will come out, it

106
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,960
will experience a torque, but
the gravitational torque

107
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,740
exactly balances it, and so
it will be standing at

108
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,460
equilibrium at this angle.

109
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,020
You can argue that if you
increase the current the angle

110
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,310
will probably become larger,
and if you increase the

111
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,090
magnetic fields the angle will
probably also become larger.
