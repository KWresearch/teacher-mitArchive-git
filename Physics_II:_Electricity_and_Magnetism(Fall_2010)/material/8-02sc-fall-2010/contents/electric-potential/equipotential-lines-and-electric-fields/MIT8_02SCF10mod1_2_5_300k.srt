1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,950

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,600
We're doing well-- we are half
a minute ahead of time, so we

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,860
can relax a little.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,680
We now come to another
classic problem--

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,460
6, which is 24-81.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,380
We have two metal spheres, one
which has the radius R1 --

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,570
it's going to be charged, and
the other one is not charged,

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,840
and is very far away.

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,830
We're going to connect this
charged one with this one.

10
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,720
Now, you're going to see
three concepts--

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,620
three birds with one stone.

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,745
The first thing that is
important that you recognize

13
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:46,890
that since all this is metal and
all of this is a conductor

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,360
that as soon as they are
connected, the potential of

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,710
the two spheres is the same.

16
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,870
There's no potential
difference--

17
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,380
that's number one.

18
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:02,870
The second thing that you will
find out is that the charge on

19
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,560
the largest sphere will be
larger than the charge on the

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,410
smallest sphere--

21
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,160
maybe that comes natural.

22
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,660
What is not so natural, perhaps,
is the electric field

23
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,920
at the surface of the smallest
sphere will be larger than the

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,210
electric field at the surface
of the largest sphere.

25
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,910
All of these three
concepts come

26
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,030
together in this one problem.

27
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,810
We first put on here
the charge Q1 ,

28
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,790
and that is not connected.

29
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,600
The electric field
at the surface--

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,430
if you're interested, then--

31
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:46,510
would be Q1 , divided by 4 pi
epsilon zero times R1 squared.

32
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:51,380
The potential at the surface--

33
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,440
or not even at the surface--
if this is a solid sphere,

34
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,260
then the potential is the same
everywhere throughout this

35
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:07,140
sphere and would Q1 divided
by 4 pi epsilon 0 R1 .

36
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:12,670
That's something that should now
be quite obvious after we

37
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,430
have done this assignment.

38
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,500
Now we connect, and charge is
going to divide: we're going

39
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,140
to have here Q1 prime,
and we're going to

40
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,120
have here Q2 prime.

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,280
I now make use of the fact that
the potential of this one

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,960
must be the same as the
potential as that one, and

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:38,960
therefore, Q1 prime divided by
4 pi epsilon 0 R1 must be the

44
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:47,080
same as Q2 prime divided
by 4 pi epsilon 0 R2 .

45
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:54,330
Since you also know that Q1
prime plus Q2 prime equals Q1

46
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:57,850
, you have two equations with
two unknowns, because you know

47
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,570
the radii: you can solve for
Q1 prime, and you can solve

48
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,670
for Q2 prime.

49
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:09,020
What you also see is that this
ratio is the same as this

50
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:14,500
ratio, and so it tells you
immediately that the charge on

51
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,850
this one is larger than the
charge on this one--

52
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,785
notice this ratio is the
same as this ratio.

53
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,710

54
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:28,850
I want you to do the electric
vectors right here at the

55
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:31,670
surface, and right here
at the surface.

56
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,580
You will then see that the
electric factors right at the

57
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,970
surface are going to be
proportional to 1 over R.

58
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,820
Since R1 smaller than R2 , you
will find that the electric

59
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,440
field here is stronger than
the electric field there.

60
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,430
They are equipotentials
potentials because they are

61
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,540
connected, but I leave
you with that far.
