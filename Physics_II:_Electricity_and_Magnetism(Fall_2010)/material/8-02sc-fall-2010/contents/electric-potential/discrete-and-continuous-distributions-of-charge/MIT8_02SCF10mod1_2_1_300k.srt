1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,910
Problem number one: problem
number one addresses the idea

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,850
of electric fields.

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:21,560
Suppose we have a uniform
electric field: E, and I think

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,520
the electric field is 10 to the
3 newtons per coulomb, and

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,770
we have an electron.

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,030

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,710
We're here at E minus--

9
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,930
the electron has a certain
velocity, a huge velocity.

10
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:44,400
It's about 2 1/2% of the speed
of light, and the force that

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,290
the electron will experience--

12
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,380
F, the magnitude of that force,
equals the charge of

13
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,820
the electron times
the magnitude of

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,920
the electric field.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,660
It is in the direction of the
electric field, or in the

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,720
opposite direction of
the electric field--

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,980
in this case, it's in the
opposite direction, and so

18
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,890
here is that force.

19
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:15,250
The electron is being
decelerated as it moves into

20
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,990
this electric field.

21
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,190
You can calculate the magnitude
of the force right

22
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,270
away: the acceleration, or I
should say, deceleration of

23
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,780
the electron is, then, this
force divided by the mass of

24
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,110
the electron.

25
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,980
Oo-- this should be an E. You
can calculate what the

26
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:40,640
acceleration is, and then going
back to 801], v at time

27
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,380
t equals t equals v at
time 0 minus at.

28
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,550
This minus takes already into
account that it's a

29
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,180
decelleration.

30
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,711
You want this to be 0, if you
want to know when it stands

31
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:57,250
still, and where it stands
still, and so you have one

32
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,960
equation with one unknown,
because you know v 0--

33
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,360
it's given--

34
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,280
and you know a, because
you just calculated

35
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,790
that, so out pops t.

36
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:13,375
If you now want to know how far
it travels, again, 801]--

37
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:22,230
x at time t minus x at time 0
equals v 0 t minus 1/2 at

38
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,390
squared, and the minus sign
takes into account the

39
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,180
decelleration.

40
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,630
You know all these quantities,
and so you can calculate the

41
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,980
distance that it travels until
it comes to a halt--

42
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,530
of course, the force will
continue to be in this

43
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,410
direction, and so it will return
in exactly the same

44
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,400
time that it took to
come to a halt.

45
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:56,830
If the motion along the E field
is only 1 centimeter,

46
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,790
then of course, it hasn't
come to a halt--

47
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,180
it's small, of course, but it
turns out that it is still

48
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,610
moving, and you're being ask
what is the percentage loss of

49
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,550
kinetic energy?

50
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:12,020
The kinetic energy at any moment
in time t 1 equals the

51
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,490
kinetic energy at some time
t equals 0, minus--

52
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,610
if there is negative
work done--

53
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:25,770
the work that is done between
time 0 and t 1 done by the

54
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,020
work done on the electron,
in this case.

55
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,970
It's the electric field that is
doing work, and the work in

56
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,120
negative, because F is in this
direction, and ds is in this

57
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,800
direction as it moves out.

58
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,530
What is the work that is done
by the electric field?

59
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,755
If we take the magnitude only
for now, it is the force that

60
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:50,005
we calculated times
the distance--

61
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:52,690

62
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,190
that is the 1 centimeter,
and you have to

63
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,920
confer that to mks--

64
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,230
and out pops the amount of work
that has been taken out

65
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,240
of the kinetic energy of the
original kinetic energy, which

66
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,040
was the 1/2 m v 0 squared.

67
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,290
You can easily calculate now
which percentage is lost--

68
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,140
that should not be
too difficult.
