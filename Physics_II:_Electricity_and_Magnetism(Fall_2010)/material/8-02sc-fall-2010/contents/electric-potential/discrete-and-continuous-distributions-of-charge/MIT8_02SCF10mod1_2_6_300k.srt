1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,670

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,060
That brings us, then,
to number seven--

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,230
dipoles.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,040
Whenever I see dipoles, I
get a little nervous--

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,320
in general, that means
a lot of mass.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,040
In this case, it turns out
that that's not so.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,720
I have here an x-axis, and
here I have the y-axis.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,770

9
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,670
Here at a distance 'a'--

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:34,750
'y=a' --

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:42,360
I have charge '-q', and a
'y=-a' , I have '+q'.

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,470
I want to know what the
potential is at a point 'P'

13
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,650
everywhere on the y-axis--

14
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,290
here, here, and everywhere.

15
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:58,990
We'll take V equals
0 at infinity.

16
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,080
Notice that V is also 0 here.

17
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,760

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,140
Think about Walter
Lewin with his +1

19
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:11,660
Coulomb coming from infinity--

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:16,990
he has to do positive work to
come to this one if he wants

21
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,320
to reach this point.

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,540
He has to do exactly the same
amount of negative work to

23
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,890
this one if he wants to
come to this point--

24
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,570
the two cancel each other out,
so it's clear that the

25
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,330
potential is 0 here if I
define the potential at

26
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,500
infinity 0.

27
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,160

28
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,840
What, now, is the potential
at that point 'P'?

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,940
It depends a little bit on
where P is located, and

30
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:48,980
whether the position of 'P' is
larger than 'a', or whether

31
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,110
the position of 'P' is
smaller than 'a'.

32
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,380
What I mean by that is--

33
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,480
is it somewhere here, or
is it outside there?

34
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,220
I will assume that it
is outside, and

35
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,050
you will do the inside.

36
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,850
If I assume that it is outside,
then the potential at

37
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,440
that point 'P'--

38
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,050
it's a scalar--

39
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,180
is the sum of the potential due
to this point, and the sum

40
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,610
of the potential due
to this point.

41
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:25,430
Let's first do this one: that
equals '-q' divided by '4 pi

42
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,150
epsilon 0'.

43
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,330
Now, I have to take the distance
between these two

44
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,080
points, which we called 'R'
earlier, and that is 'y' if

45
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,600
'y' is the position off
'P' minus 'a'--

46
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:46,500
so, 'y-a' plus, because this has
a plus charge, 'q' divided

47
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,610
by '4 pi epsilon 0' times the
distance from here to here.

48
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,330

49
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:03,450
The distance from here to
here equals 'a+y' , so

50
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:08,380
we get 'y+a' .

51
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,960
You can massage these a little
bit, and you can--

52
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,930
following the instructions
of your book--

53
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,600
calculate and can simplify
it for 'y'.

54
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,490
It's much, much larger than 'a',
and that will simplify

55
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,630
matters enormously.

56
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,440
I'm not going to do that,
because it's not all that

57
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,300
difficult, but I want you to
see that if that's the part

58
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:35,180
that you were going to do, that
if point 'P' lies below

59
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,080
'a', the situation changes.

60
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,960
When I now calculate the
potential at point 'P' to do

61
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,940
this charge '-q', the '-q'
remains here, the '4 pi

62
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,300
epsilon 0' remains here, but now
the distance between that

63
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,080
point 'P' and this position
is no longer 'y-a' --

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,270
that position has now
become 'a-y' .

65
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:07,870
That is now the distance,
and so this changes.

66
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,900
However, this part does not
change, because if I am here

67
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,850
at a distance 'a' below
the y-axis--

68
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,500
this is the y-axis and
this is the x-axis--

69
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,820
then this separation
remains 'y+a'.

70
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,260
It's only this term
that changes.
