1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,910

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:13,970
So we have now problem number
five, which is 24, 61.

3
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,560
It's a coaxial cable.

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:23,540
This is the outer part of the
cable, which has radius b.

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:29,310
And this is the inner part of
the cable, which has radius a.

6
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,160
And this is metal, is a
conductor, and the outer

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,630
sleeve is also a conductor,
and this is a vacuum.

8
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:43,140
So inside here is a cylinder
inside a cylinder.

9
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,360
We have, on the inner cylinder,
which must be on the

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,412
outer surface of it, we have a
charge plus lambda coulomb per

11
00:00:55,412 --> 00:01:03,870
meter, and we have on the outer
shell of the cylinder,

12
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,050
which will be undoubtedly on
the inside, minus lambda

13
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:12,600
coulomb per meter.

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,150
So the next charge on the
whole thing will be 0.

15
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,470
Because we have here the same
amount plus per meter as we

16
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,450
have here minus per meter.

17
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,750
And you're being asked, what is
the potential anywhere in

18
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,090
space, here, here, and there.

19
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,180
The trick always
is as follows.

20
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,200
First you calculate what the
electric field is at any

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,120
location r.

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,490
And then the second thing you do
is, you say v at position 1

23
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,485
minus v at position 2.

24
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:49,790
The integral in going from 1 to
2 of e dot dr. And if you

25
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:54,920
prefer the definition in going
from 2 to 1 with a minus sign

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,140
of e dot er, that will give
you, of course, the same

27
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,850
answer, whatever you prefer.

28
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,500

29
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,800
Very well.

30
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,240
Let's now first look at
r is smaller than a.

31
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,460
It's very clear that
e equals 0 there.

32
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,012
But let's go for r larger
than b, that

33
00:02:15,012 --> 00:02:17,310
is outside the cylinder.

34
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,940
It's clear that if you apply
Gauss's law, that you will

35
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,920
also find that e equals 0.

36
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,880
And I will leave
you with that.

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,840
You will make a Gaussian
cylinder with a

38
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,800
radius larger than b.

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,060
You give it any random
length you want to

40
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,640
give, I don't care.

41
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,160
And you apply Gauss's law.

42
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,940
And you will find, since there
is no charge inside that

43
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,370
cylinder, that the electric
field will be 0.

44
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,190
So outside 0, and here
in the core 0.

45
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,550
What now is the electric
field between a and b?

46
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,490
That's really the only part
where you have to do some

47
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,860
calculations.

48
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:11,080
Well I, now inside this vacuum,
produce a Gaussian

49
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:19,160
cylinder coaxial it has radius
r, and the radius is larger

50
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,540
than a and smaller then b.

51
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,070
It is clear that the electric
field everywhere on the bent

52
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:31,230
surface will be pointing
radially outward.

53
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,530
There's a positive
charge here.

54
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,160
I don't even have to
worry about whether

55
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,440
it's inward or outward.

56
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,800
It will shortly be outward.

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,540
So let's draw it just
here, outwards.

58
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,230
And if you can see this
here, the idea

59
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,170
is that it is outwards.

60
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,470
Perpendicular to the surface.

61
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,730
And the ds values themselves
are of course also

62
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,160
perpendicular to the
curved surface.

63
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,190
So e and the s are in
the same direction.

64
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:09,030
So if you were to look from
above, this is the radius b,

65
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:15,910
and this is the radius a, then
the electric field will be in

66
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,780
this direction, even though it
will be stronger here, as you

67
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,660
will see, than it
will be there.

68
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,101
Now I will apply Gauss's law.

69
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:29,140
The e field everywhere on the
cylinder must be the same, for

70
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,280
reasons of symmetry.

71
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,550
I take the length of the
cylinder arbitrarily l.

72
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:40,750
And so the flux through that
cylinder equals 2 pi r times

73
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,290
l, that's the surface of
the cylinder, times e.

74
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,870
The dot product becomes a plus
1, because ds and e are in the

75
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,270
same direction.

76
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,010
And that now must be the total
charge inside which is lambda

77
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,240
times l divided by epsilon 0,
because l was the length of

78
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,440
this cylinder.

79
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,330
And the l cancels, the l beta
cancels, because it would be

80
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,340
absurd if the e field depended
upon the length

81
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,870
of my Gaussian box.

82
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:14,680
And I find that e equals
lambda divided by

83
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,265
epsilon 0 2 pi r.

84
00:05:17,265 --> 00:05:20,695
A very famous result, inversely

85
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,900
proportional to 1 over r.

86
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,570
With a sphere, we had an
electric field falling off as

87
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,590
1 over 4 squared.

88
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,040
With a cylinder, we have an
electric field falling

89
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,730
of as 1 over r.

90
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,350
Now, you can imagine what you
might have if you have two

91
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,830
very long, infinitely
big plates.

92
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,870
Maybe the electric field doesn't
fall off at all.

93
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,680
Because think about it.

94
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,840
The sphere, electric field falls
off as 1 over 4 squared.

95
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,230
The cylinder, it falls
off as 1 over r.

96
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,980
So maybe two parallel plates,
the electric field doesn't

97
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,310
fall of at all.

98
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,320
Maybe it's constant in size.

99
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,430
We'll get to that.

100
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:06,950
All right.

101
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,030
Let's now talk about
potentials.

102
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:12,990
The potential at point b, at the
surface, call that point

103
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:19,300
b, is 0, because the potential
at infinity is also 0, and so

104
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,380
there's no e field all
the way from the

105
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,340
outer shell to infinity.

106
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,650
So if this potential is 0, then
that potential is also 0.

107
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,240
Now this is the outer radius
b, and this is the

108
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,490
inner radius a.

109
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,870

110
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:41,630
What, now, is the potential here
at this radius r where r

111
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,890
is smaller then b and
larger than a?

112
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:51,060
Well, if I go from here to
there, and I use my shorthand

113
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:57,230
notation, vr minus vb, b is
any point, then, on this

114
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:03,780
cylinder, that equals the
integral in going from r to b

115
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:13,730
of e dot dr. The dot becomes a
plus 1, because the cosine

116
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,620
between, the angle between e
and the r is plus 1, so I

117
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,400
don't have to worry
about that.

118
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,280
And so that becomes the integral
in going from r to b

119
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:32,180
of lambda divided by 2 pi
epsilon 0 dr over r.

120
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,420
We just calculated.

121
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,970
Now, this integral is the
logarithm of r, taken between

122
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,890
the value b and r.

123
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:46,600
So this becomes lambda over
2 pi epsilon 0 times the

124
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,680
logarithm of b minus the
logarithm of r, which is the

125
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,740
logarithm of b over r.

126
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,620
So that's the way that
the potential changes

127
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,960
from here to here.

128
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,370
And if you want to know what it
is at r equals b, well, you

129
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,480
put in r equals b, and
what do you find?

130
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,590
No surprise.

131
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,350
The logarithm of 1 is 0.

132
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,080
It's exactly what's we had.

133
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,340
If you want to know what the
potential is at r equals a,

134
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,420
then you put in r equals a,
and you here b over a.

135
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:29,610
And so I would like to make a
drawing now of the potential

136
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,900
as a function of r.

137
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,180
Here is b.

138
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,150
Here is a.

139
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:40,860
I know that right
at the center--

140
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,800
well, let's start at infinity.

141
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,880
So right at infinity,
all the way.

142
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,130
Potential is 0.

143
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,250

144
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:57,400
And then it will climb up to
a certain value in this

145
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:03,620
logarithmic fashion that
we just calculated.

146
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,260
And then, since the inner core
is metallic, there is no e

147
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,350
field in that inner core, and
if there is no e field,

148
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,200
there's an e field with an equal
potential, and so it

149
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,300
will stay there.

150
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,320
And the value here, everywhere
inside that inner core, the

151
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,210
potential is lambda 2 pi divided
by epsilon 0, times

152
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:28,220
the logarithm of b over a, and
all of this, then, is correct,

153
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,980
because v at infinity
equals 0.

154
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,260
That's why we talk about v
potential, rather than

155
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,540
potential difference.
