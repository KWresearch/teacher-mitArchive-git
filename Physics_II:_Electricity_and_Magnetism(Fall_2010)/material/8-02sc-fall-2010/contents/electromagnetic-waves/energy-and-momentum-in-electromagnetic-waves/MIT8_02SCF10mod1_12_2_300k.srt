1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,570

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,180
33, 13.

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:15,330
We have monochromatic
light, 75 watts.

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,370
We have a wavelength which I
believe has nothing to do with

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,020
the problem.

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,930
500 nanometers.

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:27,240
And it radiates uniformly
in all directions.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,750
And the question now is, what is
the associated e 0 and b 0,

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,790
the amplitudes of the e vector
and the b vector, if I am at a

10
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,960
distance r from the
source, light

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,540
source, of about 3 meters?

12
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,040
Now, in what follows, I'm going
to pretend that I can

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,770
represent this radiating source,
which radiates--

14
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,460
I hate to use that word, but
it radiates photons in all

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,800
directions.

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,370
I pretend that it can be
represented by a plain

17
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,510
electromagnetic wave, described
in the way we just

18
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:11,320
did, with a uniquely defined
e vector and b vector.

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,480
Except that now it doesn't go in
one direction, but it goes

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,880
out spherically.

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,400
And when I do that, I have here
this source, which has a

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,590
certain energy per second.

23
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,090
75 watts.

24
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,150
I call that luminosity, because
I'm an astronomer, and

25
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,790
astronomers call that
luminosity.

26
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:39,730
And let me put around this
source, at radius r, a sphere.

27
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,410
And let me put here
a little surface

28
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,730
element on the spehere.

29
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:51,020
Then there will be an energy
flux flowing through this

30
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,230
little surface element, which
is perpendicular to this

31
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,330
direction of r.

32
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:59,280
This elements a, little elements
da, whatever you want

33
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,780
to call it, is perpendicular
to this flux.

34
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,100
It's in the same direction that
the radiation is going.

35
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:15,640
So l is luminosity, which is
always in joules per second.

36
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,710
That means in watts.

37
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:27,620
f is energy flux, which
is joules per

38
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,560
second per square meter.

39
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,450
And so therefore, if there is
no absorption between the

40
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,620
source and this sphere--

41
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,730
this sphere could be huge.

42
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,660
It could be 10 meters, it
could be 10 light years.

43
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,610
But all the energy must come out
of that sphere, if there's

44
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,940
no absorption between the source
of electromagnetic

45
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,510
radiation and the sphere
with radius r.

46
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,820
So it follows immediately, if
there's no absorption, that 4

47
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,180
pi r squared times f equals l.

48
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,040
But f, as you will see, is
exactly what we have called in

49
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,950
the past the mean
pointing factor.

50
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,800
I say mean, because if we take
plane wave solutions to

51
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,190
Maxwell's equations, then of
course we have cosine terms,

52
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,520
and if we have cosine
terms, we have to

53
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,420
take the mean values.

54
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,910
And so the mean value of the
pointing vector, which equals

55
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:34,060
the mean value of e cross b
divided by miu 0, then also

56
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:38,950
equals l divided by 4 pi
r squared, and you see

57
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,680
immediately, which is no
surprise, of course, that the

58
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,980
pointing vector falls off
as 1 over 4 squared.

59
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,400
The further you are way, the
smaller the flux, and it goes

60
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,170
as 1 over 4 squared.

61
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,240
The luminosity, the amount of
energy that comes out here, of

62
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,770
course, is independent of r.

63
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,640
So let us pursue this
a little bit.

64
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,380
Notice, by the way, that the
pointing vector is completely

65
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:09,020
independent of the wavelength
lambda.

66
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,350
So if now you are being asked,
what is the e 0 and what is

67
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:17,030
the b 0, you effectively have
to use this equation.

68
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,330
We know that the pointing
vector, the mean pointing

69
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:26,170
vector s, is the mean value
of this quantity.

70
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:32,220
Well, the mean value of that
quantity equals 1/2 e 0

71
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,320
squared divided by
miu 0 times c.

72
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,730
Remember, the 1/2 comes from the
fact that you're going to

73
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,810
get a cosine squared
term in here.

74
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,610
Because this has a cosine
dependence of time, and this

75
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,790
has a cosine dependence
of time.

76
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,530
They're perpendicular to
the each other, so I

77
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,170
can forget the cross.

78
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:53,430
But b 0 is also e 0 divided
by c, so that's why

79
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,020
I get this c here.

80
00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:00,380
And that now equals l divided
by 4 pi r squared.

81
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,910
And you see, you
know everything

82
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,340
that has to be known.

83
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,580
You know l, you know
r, miu zero, and c.

84
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:13,430
So out pops 0, and if you have
to e 0, out pops b 0.

85
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:19,300
And so the e 0 and the b 0
only depend on l and r.

86
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,340
They only depend on the
pointing vector.

87
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,560
And they are independent
of the wavelength.

88
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,630
And since the pointing vector
falls off as 1 over r squared,

89
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:36,470
you see that e 0 falls of as
1/r, and b 0 also falls

90
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,080
off as 1 over r.

91
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,930
Let us take the sun.

92
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,560
The sun is a very
powerful source.

93
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,450
It has a luminosity of
4 times 10 to [? 2 ?]

94
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,270
[? 6 ?] watts.

95
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:58,060
And the distance, d, from the
sun to the earth is 150

96
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,650
kilometers.

97
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,910
Being an astrophysicist, I just
happen to remember that.

98
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:08,110
When you apply the above, you
will find that e 0 is about

99
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:13,070
1000 volts per meter at the
distance of the earth, and

100
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:19,110
that b 0 seems significantly
small, 3.4 times 10 to the

101
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,230
minus 6 tesla.

102
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:24,840
The reason being that you have
to divide this by c.

103
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,370
And the mean value of the
pointing vector, which is the

104
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:34,590
luminosity of the sun, divided
by 4 pi r squared, is the same

105
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:40,450
as number 1.4 times 10 to the
3 watts per square meter.

106
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:44,190
And this number I will come
back to is very important.

107
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,440
It's a little bit more than 1
kilowatt per square meter.

108
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,860
And what does that mean?

109
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,640
It means that the amount of
energy from the sun that

110
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,520
reaches the earth for every
square meter in the direction

111
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,460
perpendicular to the radiation
is a little more than 1

112
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,830
kilowatt per square meter.

113
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,400
1000 joules per second.

114
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,480
If you ever want to harvest
solar energy, this is the

115
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,820
maximum you can ever get.

116
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,960
And I will get back to that,
and you'll see the

117
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,800
consequences of that.

118
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,560
The consequences of that are,
as I will show you, that to

119
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,450
harvest solar energy is by no
means a trivial matter.

120
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,582
