00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
PROFESSOR: So far, so good.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,910
And we're now going on
to problem 33-39.

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,170
I return to the sun.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,400
This is my symbol for the sun,
which has a luminosity of 4

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,620
times 10 to the twenty
sixth watts.

7
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:30,220
The radius of the sun itself
is about 7 times 10 to the

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,700
eighth meters, which is about
100 times larger than the

9
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,290
radius of the earth.

10
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,680
This is my symbol
for the earth.

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,710
And if you calculate the mean
Poynting vector at the surface

12
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:51,660
of the sun itself, you'll have
to take L divided by 4 pi R of

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,620
the sun squared and that gives
you a number 6.5 times 10 to

14
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:01,720
the seventh watts every square
meter coming out of the

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,630
surface of the sun.

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,170
6.5 times 10 to the seventh
joules per second.

17
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,490
Now if I were to hold a surface
there at the surface

18
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,070
of the sun, no pun implied, and
I were to absorb all the

19
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,700
radiation from the sun, full
absorption, no reflection,

20
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,920
then the radiation pressure--

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,780
I'll put the radiation here
--would be S divided by C. But

22
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,110
of course you might as well take
this quantity divided by

23
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,700
C, whatever you prefer,
it's the same.

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,620
And that is about 0.22 newtons
per square meter, a very,

25
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,580
very, very, small pressure.

26
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:45,530
And if you take the radius, 1/2
the radius of the sun, so

27
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,980
you go inside the sun, then of
course the Poynting vector

28
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,550
will be 4 times higher because
if R is twice as small than

29
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,490
this one, it will be up by
a factor of 4 and so the

30
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:01,990
radiation pressure will be up by
a factor of 4, and so this

31
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,610
number will be up by
a factor of 4.

32
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,490
But in both cases, the
radiation pressure is

33
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:13,040
insignificant compared to the
gas pressure, as is given by

34
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,250
Professor [? Burschinger ?]

35
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,690
in this particular problem.

36
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:22,130
Now this is not necessarily true
for all stellar objects.

37
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,630
It is true that radiation
pressure in the sun plays a

38
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,490
very minor role in terms of the
size so to speak of the

39
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,110
sun, in terms of
how big it is.

40
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,370
However there are stars which
have a luminosity which is a

41
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,290
million times larger than
that of the sun.

42
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:45,110
And now the radiation pressure
begins to play an enormously

43
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,130
important role.

44
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:52,160
In fact there are stars which,
as I said, are a million times

45
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,670
more luminous, whereby at the
top of the star, near the

46
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,960
atmosphere of the star, the
gravitational attraction

47
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,850
balances just the radiation
pressure and so the atmosphere

48
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,480
of the star is literally
floating on top of the

49
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,680
radiation pressure.

50
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,540
A nice balance between, on the
one hand, gravitational pull

51
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,960
inwards and radiation
pressure outwards.

52
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,390
So this is not important
for our sun.

53
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,420
It is important for many
very luminous stars.

54
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,539
