1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,530

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:09,470
This brings us to problem
number five, and problem

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:15,400
number five is 33-50.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,080
Now we're going to do some
science fiction--

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,610
we're going to do
solar sailling.

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,950
We use an 100% reflecting
sail--

7
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:34,430
100%, because we want twice
the momentum that we would

8
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,780
have with full absorption.

9
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,680
Here is the Sun: this is the
luminosity of the Sun, this is

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,920
the mass of the Sun, and at
a distance R, here is our

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,920
wonderful science fiction
sailboat with area A, and here

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,690
is the boat.

13
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,270
Let the mass of the boat plus
the sail be m, and we want a

14
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,810
net force in this direction
which is larger then 0.

15
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,700
In other words, we want the
radiation pressure to be

16
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,390
larger than the gravitational
pull.

17
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,240
What do we want?

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,360
The radiation pressure, which is
the luminosity of the Sun,

19
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,930
times the area of this--

20
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,920
I want the radiation
force, by the way.

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,790
I'm going from pressure
immediately to force, so I'm

22
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,380
going to multiply the pressure
by this area A. Then I have

23
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,420
this factor 2, because we
have 100% reflection--

24
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,370
it's not fully absorbed, but
it's 100% reflected--

25
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,590
divided by 4 pi R squared c.

26
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,900
You should recognize this now,
because this has become a

27
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,010
force because of A, and the
2 is because of the 100%

28
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:49,890
reflection.

29
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:56,040
We want this radiation force
larger than the gravitational

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,740
attraction, which is m mass
of the Sun times G

31
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,310
divided by R squared.

32
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,330
What you find out, which may not
be so intuitive, is that

33
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,190
this is independent of R--

34
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,520
the reason being is that the
pointing vector falls off as 1

35
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,800
over R squared, but the
gravitational attraction also

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,760
falls off was 1 over
R squared.

37
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,270
If there's no absorption of the
radiation between you and

38
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,030
the sailboat, so to speak, it
remains to be seen whether

39
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,030
that is through.

40
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,350
If those distances become very,
very large, you may well

41
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,160
lose some of that radiation due
to dust particles, very

42
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,740
fine particles that are between
the Sun and you.

43
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,460
If we ignore any possible
assumption, then it doesn't

44
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,370
matter where you are, if you
have a net force outward due

45
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,640
to radiation force, you will
always have that net force

46
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,620
outwards because it's
independent of the distance R

47
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,870
to the Sun.

48
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:01,520

49
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,710
I know what m is, I know what
L is, and so I can now

50
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:10,290
calculate what A is,
and I want you to

51
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,910
calculate what A is.

52
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:18,570
A is huge; I found A to be about
3 times 10 to the sixth

53
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:25,980
square meters, which is
something like 1.7 by 1.7

54
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,170
square kilometers.

55
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,610
Indeed, you see that it is an
unbelievably, completely

56
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:37,200
impractical area that you would
need in order to get a

57
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,880
free ride, so to speak, or
an acceleration which is

58
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,750
non-zero, because once you have
a force, you always have

59
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,570
an acceleration.

60
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,430
I want to expand on this a
little bit by showing you

61
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,160
something cute.

62
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,110
If you look at the very fine
grains in our solar system,

63
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,920
you can show that if they're
small enough, that they're all

64
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,790
blown out of our solar system
because of radiation pressure.

65
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,180
Let these fine grains have
radius r, and let them have a

66
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,890
density rho, for which you may
take 2 1/2 grams per cubic

67
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,960
centimeter--

68
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,220
that is sort of like
what sand has.

69
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,400
I just made this number a little
bit arbitrary, but it's

70
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,700
not a ridiculous number.

71
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:31,050
The mass of the grain would be
4/3 pi r cubed times rho, and

72
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,160
the cross-sectional area of a
grain would be pi r squared.

73
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,840
If I use this equation, and I
want these grains to be blown

74
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,080
out of our solar system,
then I have to

75
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,290
replace A by pi r squared.

76
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,540
I would have full absorption,
and I would have no

77
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,980
reflection, so I don't have this
factor of 2, and I would

78
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,595
have to substitute for
this little m 4/3 pi

79
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:56,690
r cubed times rho.

80
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,800
I would get that the luminosity
of the Sun times

81
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,690
the cross-sectional area of the
grains divided by 4 pi r

82
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:12,790
squared c, must be larger than
4/3 pi r cubed times rho times

83
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:16,970
the mass of the Sun times
G divided by r squared.

84
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,040
That would be the condition for
these grains, if this were

85
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,800
the only thing that mattered
in the solar system to be

86
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,560
blown out of the solar system.

87
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:36,010
I lose a pi here, I lose r
squared here, I lose r squared

88
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,370
here again with this r, and if
you work this out, you know

89
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,170
all these numbers.

90
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,460
You will see that with r smaller
than a certain number,

91
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,140
these grains will not
be able to survive

92
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,550
in our solar system.

93
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,820
That is quite remarkable.

94
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,420
