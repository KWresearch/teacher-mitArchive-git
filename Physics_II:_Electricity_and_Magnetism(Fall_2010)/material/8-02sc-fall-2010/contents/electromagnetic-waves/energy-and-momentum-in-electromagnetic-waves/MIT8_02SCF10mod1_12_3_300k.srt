1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,020

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,856
Let's now talk about
radiation pressure.

3
00:00:11,856 --> 00:00:13,340
This is an extremely

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:17,760
interesting subject in physics.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,240
There are several ways
that you can

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,960
derive radiation pressure.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,290
It can be derived purely from
the concept of electromagnetic

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,270
plane wave solutions to
Maxwell's Equations.

9
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,880
It's a long road, but
it can be derived.

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,910
I've seen Professor
[? Yewits ?]

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,810
when she lectured to 803 do
it in a beautiful way.

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,640
I would like to shortcut my
way to success and do it a

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,700
little faster, but perhaps not
so transparent for you.

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,630
Perhaps you remember one of
the famous relations from

15
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:57,780
Einstein, in that if I have
individual photons--

16
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,076
if I have an individual
photon--

17
00:01:01,076 --> 00:01:06,200
and an individual photon is a
very different thing from this

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,890
continuous stream of
electromagnetic radiation,

19
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,600
which has no beginning in
time, no end in time, no

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,980
beginning in space, and
no end in space.

21
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,340
That is our mathematical
representation of plane wave

22
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,600
solutions to Maxwell's
Equations--

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,870
a photon is a very
different thing.

24
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,560

25
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,610
It's only generated during a
very certain amount of time--

26
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,540
it's more like a wave package,
and it propagates with the

27
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,340
speed of light.

28
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,960
It's a very different thing.

29
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,610
In physics, we deal with both,
and if you deal with both in

30
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,950
the correct way, you always
get consistent answers.

31
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,520
In a way, you have a choice:
I now choose the photon

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,200
representation.

33
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,050
I write down for the photon
energy E of n--

34
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,390
E n--

35
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,490
because I don't want to write
a E, because that might

36
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,160
confuse you with energy.

37
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,680
That, according to Einstein,
is the momentum that the

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,560
photon carries times
the speed of light.

39
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,410

40
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:12,410
Assume now that we have here a
source of photons going off in

41
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,130
many directions.

42
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:20,250
We're dealing with many photons,
but the luminosity L,

43
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,880
which is in joules per seconds,
is a given value--

44
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,740
it's a light bulb, and it could
be a 100 watt light

45
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,080
bulb, or it could be the Sun--

46
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,620
and at a distance R, which is
a sphere, there is here a

47
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:40,290
little element d A. When these
individual photons hit this

48
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,730
little element d A, they are,
in what follows, fully

49
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:53,850
absorbed by that element d A.

50
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:59,730
That means the momentum is
destroyed, and that means if

51
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,840
the momentum is destroyed, the
whole photon is destroyed.

52
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,610
This little element d A must
feel a pressure, and it must

53
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,730
feel a force.

54
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,200
It's like throwing rotten
tomatoes at someone's face--

55
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,430
every time you feel a rotten
tomato, the momentum is

56
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,210
completely taken out, because it
goes whoosh and it slushes

57
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,280
to the ground.

58
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,310
There's no momentum left--
it doesn't bounce off--

59
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,640
and every time you feel a rotten
tomato on your face,

60
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,400
you feel a little push
backwards, you feel pressure,

61
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,300
and you feel a force.

62
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:36,890
In that same way, this little
element here, d A, will feel a

63
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,440
pressure, and it will
feel a force.

64
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:52,150
The energy per second, which
is absorbed by d A, is very

65
00:03:52,150 --> 00:04:01,210
simply d A times L divided
by 4 pi R squared.

66
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,630
That's immediately obvious,
because d A invited by 4 pi R

67
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:09,500
squared is the fraction of all
the radiation that goes out in

68
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,210
this direction, and L is the
number of joules per second,

69
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,510
so this is the energy that
flows out of here.

70
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,980
That, of course, energy per unit
time is the derivative of

71
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,460
this quantity, so you can also
write down that it is d E n

72
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:32,290
dt, but that, according to
Einstein's equation, equals dp

73
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,570
dt times c.

74
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,010
These are now not individual
photons anymore, because L

75
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,930
represents many, many photons,
so this is the

76
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,620
results of many photons.

77
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,280
These many photons
on this surface

78
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,610
element d A cause a force.

79
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:59,400
You see right here that dp dt
represents a force, and if you

80
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,980
go back to 801, you'll remember

81
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:08,940
that dp dt is a force.

82
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:15,290
If I take that force and I
divide that by the area d A,

83
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,670
then I get the pressure.

84
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,910
So you see here for the first
time that the radiation

85
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:29,360
pressure is simply this quantity
divided by d A, and I

86
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,660
have to bring the c here,
because it is 1 over

87
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,880
d A times dp dt--

88
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,810
the radiation pressure equals
L divided by 4 pi R squared

89
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,760
divided by c.

90
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,980
This is the radiation pressure
only in case the radiation is

91
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,230
fully absorbed.

92
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:57,610

93
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:04,430
This quantity here we earlier
called the pointing vector, so

94
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,950
the radiation pressure is also
the pointing vector divided by

95
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,330
c, but now I have to take the
mean pointing vector, because

96
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,900
we have to take into account
the oscillation of the

97
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,390
electromagnetic radiation.

98
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:22,080
You should convince yourself
that both this and this are in

99
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,600
units of newtons per
square meter.

100
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,740
Whichever one of the two you
want to apply, it's fine--

101
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:34,810
either one will do.

102
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,240
The radiation pressure, when we
have full absorption, full

103
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,570
absorption is given
by this quantity.

104
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,720
If this radiation pressure
x on a surface

105
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,570
which has area A--

106
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,150
and if I called that radiation
pressure T--

107
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,220
then the radiation force, the
force due to radiation

108
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,320
pressure, would be the radiation
pressure times the

109
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,920
area A. If, however, the
radiation is not fully

110
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,660
absorbed, but is reflected
400%, which can happen.

111
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,360
You can have a mirror, and you
can reflect almost 100% light.

112
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,040
You can have metal surfaces
which can reflect radar, and

113
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,470
also radio emission for 100%
then you gain a factor of 2.

114
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:25,150
If you were dealing with
100% reflection--

115
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,120
I hope you can read colors--

116
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,700
then you would get a factor of
2 here, you would get factor

117
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,330
of 2 here, and you would
get a factor of 2 here.

118
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,050
This is now no longer throwing
rotten tomatoes at your face

119
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,930
that go boom, boom, boom, but
this is now throwing tennis

120
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:46,930
balls at your face, which bounce
back exactly with the

121
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:49,570
same speed at which
they came in.

122
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,840
There is a reversal of the
velocity, and so the momentum

123
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,100
transfer is twice, that's
exactly what you have here

124
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,620
also with radiation
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

125
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,280
