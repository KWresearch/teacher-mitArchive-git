1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,083

2
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:13,120
This is problem six,
which is 33-26.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,720
Let's do a time check--

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,260
boy, I must have gone fast. I'm
one minute and 15 seconds

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,810
ahead of time.

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:23,252
Now we have a standing wave--

7
00:00:23,252 --> 00:00:30,770
a standing electromagnetic
wave. We have a frequency

8
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:38,540
which is 600 megahertz, and 600
megahertz would give the

9
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:43,280
wavelength lambda c divided by
F, which is half a meter.

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,090

11
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,583
A standing wave is very
different from a traveling

12
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:52,440
wave, but in terms of the
wavelength and as far as the

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,270
wavelength is concerned, it is
still c divided by F. In terms

14
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:05,000
of the magnitude of the magnetic
vector, it is still

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,520
the magnetic field of the
E vector divided by c.

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,610
But there is a big difference:
there is a very, very big

17
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:18,250
difference, if we only look at
the electric vector for now.

18
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:25,210
If there were a standing wave
between these two mirrors

19
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:30,620
which reflect travelling waves
back and forth, then at one

20
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,870
point in time, I might see
an electric field that is

21
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,930
pointing like so--

22
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:44,340
E vector, E vector, E
vector, E vector, E

23
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,240
vector, and E vector.

24
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,410
You may say, that looks like a
traveling wave. Well, yes, it

25
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,220
looks like one, but
it's not moving--

26
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,520
it's standing still.

27
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,850
A little later in time-- a
quarter period later in time,

28
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,360
if I assume that this is the
maximum displacement, and that

29
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,040
this is the amplitude of E
vector-- a little later in

30
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,620
time, the E vectors [? will ?]
everywhere in space 0.

31
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:15,330
Half a period later in time,
the E vectors will have

32
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,320
reversed, and so on.

33
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,370
These will oscillate out of
phase, and these will

34
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,210
oscillate in phase.

35
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,030
We have points in space here,
which we call nodes, where the

36
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,740
E vector is always 0.

37
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,460
In this particular case, since
this separation is 75

38
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:41,600
centimeters, you would have
these nods at 0, 25, 50, and

39
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,880
75 centimeters.

40
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,140
You can only have a standing
wave if the separation of

41
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,900
these reflecting mirrors--

42
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,480
whereby these travelling waves
move through each other, which

43
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,790
causes the standing
wave pattern--

44
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,400
if that separation is a multiple
of half a wavelenght,

45
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,350
which you see it is.

46
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:05,780
It is 3 times 75 centimeters,
and this is 3 times 25

47
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,030
centimeters.

48
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,930

49
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,890
Magnetic fields and E fields
relate very differently to

50
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,790
each other in standing
waves than they do

51
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,380
in traveling waves.

52
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,290
In travelling waves,
I mentioned to you

53
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,990
that they're in phase--

54
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,520
that's no longer the case.

55
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,890
In traveling waves,
the maxima--

56
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,610
the locations of maxima--

57
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,740
are therefore always at the same
locations of the electric

58
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,080
fields as they are of the
magnetic field, and that's no

59
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,930
longer the case either.

60
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,590
It's pretty nasty, but the
magnetic field and electric

61
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,350
fields are 90 degrees
out of phase.

62
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:54,460
Where the electric field has
its nodes at all moments in

63
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,030
time-- they never change--

64
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:58,180
it's exactly where the magnetic
fields have their

65
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,900
anti-nodes, their maxima.

66
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,160
They would still be
perpendicular to the direction

67
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,110
of E, but they have their maxima
here, and they would

68
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,870
have their minima right here.

69
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,540
They have their nodes here,
where the electric fields have

70
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,700
their anti-nodes.

71
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,910
It's very difficult--

72
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,840
not all difficult, but it's very
different, and the only

73
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,440
way you can see that is using
Maxwell's Equations

74
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,870
rigorously, or Young does
it in a very nice way.

75
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,950
He has two traveling waves from
opposite directions with

76
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,350
the same amplitude--

77
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,550
not standing--

78
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,460
traveling electromagnetic
plane waves, and then he

79
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,900
interferes them with
each other.

80
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,700
They have the same amplitudes in
E and B, and then he shows

81
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,510
that if you adopt that picture,
you indeed can

82
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,590
demonstrate that E and B are 90
degrees out of phase, and

83
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,000
that the locations of the
maxima of E and B--

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,930
or I should say, the nodes of E
coincide with the anti-nodes

85
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,700
of B, and the nodes of B
coincide with the anti-nodes

86
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,840
of E. It's actually a very nice
way of showing it-- all

87
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,890
of that is completely
consistent

88
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,860
with Maxwell's Equations.

89
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,970
I want you to appreciate that
in a standing wave, the mean

90
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,150
pointing vector equals
zero, and there is

91
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,165
a reason for that.

92
00:05:23,165 --> 00:05:27,260
It's because B and E are 90
degrees out of phase.

93
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,560
If you make E oscillate with
cosine omega t, then the B

94
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,440
vector would oscillate 90
degrees out of phase, and so

95
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,190
it would be the sine omega t.

96
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,980
That's what it means, 90
degrees out of phase.

97
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:44,330
To me, pointing vector would
be proportional to cosine

98
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:48,800
omega t, if we assume that
that's associated an E vector.

99
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,940
It's also proportional to sine
omega t, because of the phase

100
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,550
difference with the B vector.

101
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,520
The mean value between the
cosine omega t and sine omega

102
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,470
t, averaged over one complete
oscillation, equals 0.

103
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,195
In a standing wave,
there is never

104
00:06:08,195 --> 00:06:11,040
any net energy transport.

105
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,870
That doesn't mean that if you
look on a short time scale--

106
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,220
short relative to one complete
period of oscillation--

107
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,900
then there is energy
transport.

108
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,490
It goes in one direction,
it goes back, and it

109
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,050
sloshes back and forth.

110
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:29,810
If you take the mean over one
full period of oscillation,

111
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,630
then the net energy transport
equals 0 in a standing wave,

112
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,250
which is not the case for
a traveling wave.

113
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:38,265
