1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,180

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,680
Problem one is 33-5.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:20,160
It deals with a traveling
electromagnetic wave.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,820
I told you earlier that I wasn't
joking that I know very

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,170
few equations in physics.

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,970
I can derive many from
the few that I know--

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,730
I know Mach's law equations.

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,200
Yes, I do--

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,780
certainly after this course.

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,660
I also know some of the
consequences of Mach's law

11
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,920
equations related to
travelling waves.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,730
I will share those with you,
and if you remember those--

13
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,890
because it would be
rather silly to

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,330
derive them every timee--

15
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:51,070
then it's very easy to
write down traveling

16
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,530
electromagnetic waves.

17
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,130
With the vectors in the right
direction, and the amplitudes

18
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,390
all correct, and the plus
and minus signs correct.

19
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,080
The first thing that I happen to
remember is that that the E

20
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,470
vector is always perpendicular
to the B vector.

21
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:13,990
The second is that E, as well
as B, are both perpendicular

22
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,830
to the direction of
propagatation.

23
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:26,340
The third is that E and
B both are in phase at

24
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,250
all moments in time.

25
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,370
What does that mean?

26
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:32,350
It means if one reaches is the
maximum value, the other

27
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,260
reaches is a maximum value at
the same moment in time, but

28
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,350
at right angles, and if one
goes through 0, the other

29
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,290
goes through 0.

30
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,035
That's what it means--
always in phase.

31
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:43,850

32
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:49,090
B 0, which is the amplitude of
the magnetic field vector

33
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:55,690
equals E 0 divided by C when the
electromagnetic radiation

34
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,940
is in vaccuum.

35
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,250

36
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,540
Independent of electromagnetic
waves, what always holds is

37
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,010
that the pointing vector,
which tells you how much

38
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:12,660
energy per second flows per
square meter out of a

39
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:19,050
particular surface, and equals
E across B divided by mu 0.

40
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,340
This is energy per second
flowing through each square

41
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,890
meter, and I will
call that flux--

42
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,840
it's an energy flux.

43
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,150
What also always holds--

44
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,930
lambda equals c times the period
of one oscillation, and

45
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,700
don't confuse this
T with tesla.

46
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,050
This is also c divided by the
frequency of the radiation F.

47
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,230
What you will often see
introduced is a wave number k,

48
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,280
which has nothing to
do with the unit

49
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,050
vector in the c direction.

50
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,300
Nothing--

51
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,170
that k equals 2 pi divided by
lambda, and that has as a unit

52
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,740
1 over meter.

53
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,620
Since omega equals 2 pi times
the frequency F, it follows

54
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,840
immediately that omega divided
by k also is the speed of

55
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,740
light, the speed at which
electromagnetic radiation

56
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,540
propagates itself in vaccuum.

57
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,370
Now, if you can remember all
these things, that would help.

58
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,900
I happen to remember them.

59
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,130
We have here in problem one: we
have a frequency which is

60
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:38,920
4.0 times 10 to the thirteenth
hertz, so if follows

61
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:46,890
immediately that omega equals
2.5 times 10 to the fourteenth

62
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,660
radians per second.

63
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,990
It follows that lambda
equals 7.5 times 10

64
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,360
to the minus 6 meters--

65
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,390
75,000 angstroms, if
you like that unit.

66
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,780
This is infrared radiation.

67
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:10,110
We are also being told that the
direction of v is in plus

68
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:17,970
y, and we're being told that the
B vector oscillates in the

69
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:21,400
direction of x-- plus, minus,
plus, minus, plus, minus with

70
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,280
that angular velocity omega.

71
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,790
You know B 0, whatever
that is.

72
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,610
The B vector, if we write that
down in terms of x, y, and z,

73
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,190
and all moments in time, would
be the amplitude of the B

74
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:42,450
vector times cosine omega t--

75
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,420
this indicates the oscillatory
character--

76
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,720
minus k y in the x direction.

77
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,330

78
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,770
Here k means simply 2 pi
divided by lambda--

79
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,100
if you want to write for this
k 2 pi divided by lambda, be

80
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,930
my guest.

81
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,120
Let's look at these things:
this minus sign

82
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,710
is absolutely crucial.

83
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,860
If this were a plus sign, the
wave would not be propagating

84
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,250
in the plus y direction.

85
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,070
You can immediately check
that for yourself--

86
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:24,370
increase t by a teeny
weeny little bit.

87
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,480
If you want the cosine function
to be exactly the

88
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:33,310
same, you would have to increase
y by a teeny weeny

89
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:39,610
little bit, so that omega t
minus k y remains the same.

90
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,320
For this wave to propagate in
the plus y direction, it is

91
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,340
important that this sine here
and this sine here have an

92
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,380
opposite sign.

93
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,790
If they both have
the same sign--

94
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,360
minus minus or plus plus--

95
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,990
then the wave would run in
the minus y direction.

96
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,585
This x tells you simply that to
B vector oscillates in the

97
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:09,660
x direction-- sometimes
plus, sometimes minus.

98
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,320
Omega, you already know.

99
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,000
If you are interested in k, by
any chance, then I believe

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,690
that is 8.38 times 10 to
the 5 meters minus 1.

101
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:29,950
Now since you know B 0, you
also know E 0, because E 0

102
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,340
equals b 0 times c.

103
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:39,040
If we write down now the E
vector as a function of x, y,

104
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,900
z, and t, then we will get E 0
here, which you know, and then

105
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:53,160
I get exactly this same
argument, omega t minus k y.

106
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,930
Why?

107
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,930
Because I mentioned earlier that
E and B are always, at

108
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,270
any moment in time, exactly
in phase, and that's only

109
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:07,210
possible if this is
identical to that.

110
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,800
Now comes the question--

111
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,200
what is the direction that
I should put here?

112
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,300
What is the unit vector that
I should put here?

113
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,050
For that, I'm going
to make a drawing.

114
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,530

115
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,770
I'm going to make
a drawing of a

116
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,510
right-handed coordinate system.

117
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,850
Always make a drawing of a

118
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,070
right-handed coordinate system.

119
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:35,720
A right-handed coordinate system
is a coordinate system

120
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,880
whereby x cross y equals z--

121
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,420
don't even think of ever doing
in another way, because you

122
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,400
get into deep trouble.

123
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:57,010
Let this be x, let this be y,
and then this would be z--

124
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:02,820
convince yourself that x cross
y would then be z.

125
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,350
Now pick any moment in time, and
let us assume that the B

126
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:10,160
vector is in this direction.

127
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,620
Of course, it's not only along
the x direction in this

128
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:15,120
direction, but since
it's a plane wave,

129
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,430
it's everywhere here--

130
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,490
the same magnitude and
the same direction.

131
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,950
This wave propagates
to the right.

132
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:26,110
A little later in time-- half a
period in time, if we assume

133
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:31,220
that this is the maximum value
B possible in this direction,

134
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,600
it will be pointing down.

135
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,680
With a quarter period in time,
it will go through 0, and they

136
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,600
will all go through 0 at
exactly the same time.

137
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,580
In what direction at this moment
in time should I now

138
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,890
point E so that--

139
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,380
and this is one of my

140
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,100
statements that I made earlier--

141
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:56,230
so that E cross B is in
the direction of B?

142
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,330
That means, in this case, is the
direction of positive y.

143
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,490
That should not give
you any problems--

144
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:08,660
the only way that you can do
that is when E is in the plus

145
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,160
z direction.

146
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,040
Convince yourself that only then
is E cross B in the plus

147
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,690
y direction.

148
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:22,720
That means that if we now have
to finish this vector notation

149
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,010
for E, we have to write it
down here in z roof,

150
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,910
and it's all done.

151
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,390
I can now ask the question--

152
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,550
suppose we wanted to move that
wave in the other direction,

153
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,050
not in plus y, but in minus y?

154
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:40,210
What would we have to change?

155
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,300
We could change this minus sign
to a plus sign, and this

156
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,760
minus sign to a plus sign.

157
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,360
What counts is--

158
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,400
actually, it's not so much that
this becomes a plus, but

159
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,180
that these two signs here and
here are the same, but that's

160
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,720
not enough.

161
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,600
If you want E cross B to be in
the opposite direction, you

162
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,250
also must either put a minus
sign here so that you get a

163
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:11,670
minus x, and leave the plus
here, or you put a minus sign

164
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,820
here in the minus E direction,
and leave the plus there.

165
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,100
Whenever you have to change
the direction of

166
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,200
propagatation, keep in mind that
it is not enough to only

167
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,890
change the signs inside the
brackets of the cosine terms,

168
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,260
but you also have to take into
account that E cross B must

169
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,780
change direction.

170
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:32,966
