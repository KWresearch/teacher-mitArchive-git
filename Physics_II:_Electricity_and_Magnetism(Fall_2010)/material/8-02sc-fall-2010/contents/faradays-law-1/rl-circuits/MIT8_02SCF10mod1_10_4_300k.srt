1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,990

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:12,400
This is problem number
four, which is 32-30.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,050
It is a step-up transformer,
and it is an ideal

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:16,850
transformer--

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,800
I will come back to that several
times as to what I

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,290
mean by that.

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:28,140
I have a primary winding whereby
the driving EMF has

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:35,250
121 volts r m s, and of course,
it goes with cosine

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,500
omega T. It has N 1 windings.

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,040

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,290
On the secondary side--

12
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,965

13
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:49,480
you'll see in a minute
what I mean by that--

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:57,133
I have E 2 r m s, which
is 15,600 volts,

15
00:00:57,133 --> 00:00:59,080
which is much higher.

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:05,480
I have N 2 windings, and I 2
must be smaller or equal to 10

17
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,780
to the minus 2 amperes.

18
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,490
If not, then the
fuse will blow.

19
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,280
What would a transformer
like this look like?

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:23,310
They are made of sheets of iron,
and these sheets have

21
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,560
this shape-- this is open.

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,580
The sheets are glued
together--

23
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,260
many of them--

24
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,050
and the reason why that's done
is to avoid eddy currents, and

25
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:36,640
you will learn about eddy
currents later.

26
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:46,350
Here is the primary winding,
and so here is your E 1--

27
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,710
E 0 1 cosine omega t--

28
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:55,000
it's driving this, and
it has N 1 windings.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,090
Here is your secondary
winding--

30
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,710
there could be a
resistor here--

31
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:10,350
there would be a voltmeter v 2
here, this has N 2 windings,

32
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:15,600
and this voltmeter would read E
2, which is an induced EMF--

33
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:23,810
I'll write for that E
0 2 cosine omega t.

34
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,040
I assume that the two are
exactly in phase-- the whole

35
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,790
thing is a little bit
simplified, and I would refer

36
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,770
you to page 1014 if you want
to read up on this in some

37
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,320
more detail.

38
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,690
I can do the closed group
integral off E dot dl, both in

39
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,150
this loop, and in this loop--

40
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,860
Faraday's Law, because
Kirchhoff's Law is for the

41
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,690
birds-- it doesn't hold.

42
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:59,280
Closed loop integral of E dot
dl is not 0, but in the

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,170
primary side, it equals minus
N 1 times the magnetic flux

44
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,800
derivative versus time.

45
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,820
This phi of B is only through
the surface of

46
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,010
one of these loops--

47
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,540
through one of these spiral
staircase surfaces.

48
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,720
That's the way we defined
as phi of B--

49
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,980
that's why we have
an N 1 here.

50
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:31,560
This equals E 1, and that, of
course, equals E 0 1 times the

51
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,700
cosine of omega t.

52
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,800

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,560
Now we go to the second side.

54
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,030
When we go to the second side,
the integral of E dot dl

55
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,900
again is not 0--

56
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,680
again, Kirchhoff's Law is for
the birds, but now I get N 2

57
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,100
times the same B phi B dt.

58
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,510
That, of course, equals my
E 2, which is E 0 2 times

59
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,005
cosine omega t.

60
00:04:05,005 --> 00:04:06,210
Why is it the same?

61
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,420
Because we make the
assumption--

62
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,950
the simplification--

63
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:14,470
the magnetic field generated
by this primary, which

64
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,150
oscillates back and forth with
omega omega and goes this way,

65
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,620
this way, this way, this way,
so that it stays entirely

66
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,100
inside this iron.

67
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,490
This is not an unreasonable
approximation so that is B 0

68
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,700
outside everywhere.

69
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:37,630
That would mean that the flux
going through one of these

70
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:41,510
open surface of one of these
open staircase surfaces is the

71
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,920
same as the one that goes
through here, but since I have

72
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,010
N 2 windings here, I have
an N 2 here, and I

73
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,660
only have an N 1 there.

74
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,950
It follows, then, immediately
by taking the ratio of these

75
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:02,560
two, that E 2 divided by E 1
equals N 2 divided by N 1.

76
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,630
In an ideal case, this gives
you enormous insights--

77
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:09,380
that means if you have a ratio
of the windings 1,000 to 1,

78
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,080
you can step up the voltage
by a factor of 1,000.

79
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,560
In our particular case, this
ratio is 130, so we step up

80
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,170
the voltage by a
factor of 130.

81
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:27,140
How much power is now delivered
to the resistor in

82
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,640
the secondary if I 2 has reached
its maximum value of

83
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,670
10 to the minus 2 amperes?

84
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:39,510
Keep in mind again that the mean
power per cycle equals

85
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:46,270
the voltage r m s of side
2 times the current

86
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,520
r m s at site 2.

87
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,420
This now is the [? 50,600 ?]

88
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:57,580
times 10 to the minus 2,
so this is 156 watts.

89
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,920
If the situation is ideal, which
it almost never is, that

90
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,990
means if there is no energy
loss, if there is no heat

91
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,280
loss-- which is not true,
because if you put your hands

92
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,530
on these transformers, they
are warm, and you can even

93
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,890
burn your hands.

94
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,880
In fact, sometimes the glue
that is used to glue these

95
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,200
sheets of metal together
can even melt.

96
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,620
If you assume that there's no
energy loss, then, of course,

97
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,140
this power of 156 watts must
be delivered also by the

98
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,580
primary site.

99
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,430
Therefore, you will get now for
an ideal transformer the

100
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:48,640
situation that v 2 I 2 r m s r
m s must be v 1 I 1 r m s r m

101
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,730
s, and this is 156 watts.

102
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:56,590
You will have no problems
calculating that I 1 r m s is

103
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,770
1.3 amperes.

104
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:03,900
You see now that the voltages
step up in ratio in 2 over N

105
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:10,570
1, but the currents step down in
ratio in N 1 over N 2, and

106
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,070
so the voltages are
proportional to

107
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,570
the number of windings.

108
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,440
The currents are inversely
proportional to the windings

109
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,580
in order to keep the power
delivered to the left side the

110
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,020
same as the power to
the right side.

111
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,520
Notice that this current here in
1 is substantially higher--

112
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,410
it's 130 higher--

113
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,680
than the current in the
secondary part in number two.

114
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,323
