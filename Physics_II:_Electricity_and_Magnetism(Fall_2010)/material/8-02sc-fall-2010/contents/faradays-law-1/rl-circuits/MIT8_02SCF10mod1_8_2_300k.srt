1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,055

2
00:00:08,055 --> 00:00:12,660
I will now enter
problem eight.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:15,540
But before I enter problem
eight, I want to evaluate with

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:20,000
you what actually a
solenoid is doing.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,460
And I hope I will convince you,
with two problems that I

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,700
will do in a row, that
you should never

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,280
abandon Faraday's Law.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,330
Never amend it.

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,710
It's unwise, it's unnecessary,
it is risky and it only leads

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,780
to wrong and incorrect
answers.

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,510
It may work, once in a blue
moon because you happen to

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,360
know the answer.

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,710
But it's conceptually,
completely the

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,390
wrong way to think.

15
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,690
Whenever you have a known
conservative field,

16
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:50,860
Kirchhoff's law does not hold.

17
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,770
The one that says that the
integral of E dot dl closed

18
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,370
loop integral is zero,
does not hold.

19
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,800
Let's first evaluate how a
solenoid works, because we're

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,050
going to need that.

21
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,760

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,230
Suppose we have some resistor
here and we had

23
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,380
some battery here.

24
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,680
And this solenoid
had a length, l.

25
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,930
So this is a solenoid.

26
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,390

27
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,550
It has N, windings.

28
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,660
And let us assume that these
are circular, close to

29
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:37,690
circular windings, which have
surface area pi r squared.

30
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,380
The first question that I want
to answer is, what is the

31
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,920
magnetic field inside
the solenoid.

32
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,510
There will be a current
flowing, which

33
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,020
will change with time.

34
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,700
Because this solenoid has the
ability to influence the

35
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,970
increase in current.

36
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,045
In this case, when I
throw a switch, the

37
00:01:56,045 --> 00:01:57,240
current will increase.

38
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,850
The solenoid will try
to hold that down.

39
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:04,270
We call that Lenz's law.

40
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,330
But at any moment in time that
I have a current I(t) flowing

41
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:11,660
in the circuit, through
the solenoid.

42
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,170
Let's assume that might B field
is pointing upwards, it

43
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,030
depends on the helicity
of the coil.

44
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,210
And that's assume that the B
field is only finite and

45
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,280
constant inside the solenoid.

46
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,210
Zero outside here, zero outside
there, and even zero

47
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,340
outside there, which is
a little bit of an

48
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,660
approximation.

49
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:36,640
So we only assume that the
B field is inside.

50
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,740
I now forget, for the time
being, Faraday's law.

51
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,450
I'm going to calculate
the B field inside.

52
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,370
And for that, I choose
Ampere's law.

53
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,270
The side y.

54
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,900
This also y.

55
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,140
And the length here
is very large.

56
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,330
If there's any magnetic field
here, it would be

57
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,850
perpendicular to the side.

58
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,960
Certainly inside the
solenoid it's

59
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,970
perpendicular to the side.

60
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,880
And so the dot product,
B.dl, would vanish.

61
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:14,410
So I have the closed loop
integral of B.dl equals mu

62
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,450
zero times I thru.

63
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,130
There's no displacement current
if I choose this as my

64
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,410
flat surface.

65
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,710
There's no changing electric
field going

66
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,460
through this surface.

67
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,890
The B field is only defined
inside the solenoids.

68
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,030
B.dl right here is zero.

69
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,630
There is no B field outside.

70
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,330
At least if I choose this far
enough away, the B field here

71
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,400
will be zero.

72
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,180
And if there's any B field here,
it will be perpendicular

73
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,320
so I can ignore that.

74
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,550
So what do I get when I make
this closed loop integral,

75
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,470
going around clockwise in
the direction of B?

76
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:59,430
I find that B times y equals mu
zero times I. Bu now, this

77
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,420
is a soap film, flat
soap film.

78
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,310
And the current penetrates
several times

79
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,470
through this soap film.

80
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,690
How many times does
it penetrate

81
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:10,670
through this soap film?

82
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:15,290
Y divided by l times N. This is
the number of times that it

83
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,310
pokes through.

84
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,080
I have to take that into account
in Ampere's law.

85
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,170
I lose my y, and I find the
result that you have seen

86
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:27,690
before, that the magnetic fields
in a solenoid equals mu

87
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,950
zero times I times
N divided by l.

88
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,260
And notice, it's independent of
the cross sectional area of

89
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,760
the solenoid, little r.

90
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,090
And it is also independent
of y.

91
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,360
It better be independent of y,
because Maxwell couldn't care

92
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,600
less about how long
you choose this.

93
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,680
So far so good.

94
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,060
We now have the magnetic field
inside the solenoid.

95
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:03,670
Now, I want to calculate, in
anticipation of Faraday's law,

96
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,500
a closed loop integral E.dl .

97
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,090

98
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,020
I know I'm going to need, sooner
or later, when I deal

99
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:19,030
with solenoids, this term, d/dt
times B.dA --I will ram

100
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:21,780
it down your throat
once more.--

101
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,140
This is a closed loop.

102
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,870

103
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:33,360
And this is an open surface
attached to that loop.

104
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,040
Now if you look at this circuit,
then the closed loop

105
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,780
that I will choose is the loop
that goes through the wires.

106
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:47,800
I crawl inside the wire of the
self inductance, I come out

107
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,370
here, I go through here,
and I enter up here.

108
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,110
That is my closed loop.

109
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,500
That is my closed group
integral E.dl

110
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,640
And I always go around in the
direction of the current.

111
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,250
That's my convention that avoids
that I get unnecessary

112
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,830
minus signs where I
don't want them.

113
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:10,760
But now, you have to choose a
surface which is attached to

114
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,850
this closed loop.

115
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,620
And that is very hard
to imagine.

116
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,180
And the way I normally do this
when I lecture 802, I did this

117
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,310
whole circuit in soap.

118
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,360
And when I did this is soap, you
get a soap film here, but

119
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,540
you get a very peculiar
staircase

120
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,130
soap film in the solenoid.

121
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,930
The solenoid, the surface of
the soap film is like the

122
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,210
surface of the staircase of a
spiral staircase that goes up.

123
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,700
I have a soap film here,
a soap film there.

124
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,320
And the soap film rotates
around, keeps going up and up

125
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,840
and up and up and up.

126
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:56,300
Not unlike this situation
here.

127
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,190
Not unlike that.

128
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,630
The boundary of the solenoid
is this line.

129
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,660
And the surface, which
is this soap film, is

130
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,350
the staircase itself.

131
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,340
Maybe we can look at
it from above.

132
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,200
You can see it again
a little better.

133
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,610
It is a very hard to
understand surface.

134
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:19,080
But what counts is, and what
is important, that the

135
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,965
magnetic field pokes
n time through

136
00:07:22,965 --> 00:07:25,480
this staircase surface.

137
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:31,330
And therefore, when I calculate
this term, the

138
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:34,300
magnetic field, which I will
ignore here, I will assume

139
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,750
that even though there's a
current flowing here, that the

140
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,180
magnetic flux going through
this film is almost

141
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,100
negligible.

142
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,660
But here, it's very strong,
the magnetic field.

143
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,140
I now have to take into account,
that is magnetic

144
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,580
field goes n times through
this open surface.

145
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:54,660
And so what now is this term?

146
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:05,550
Well, the integral of B.dA, over
that open surface, that

147
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,190
staircase surface.

148
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,690
First of all, it is B itself.

149
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:14,310
So that is mu zero
times I times N

150
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:17,070
divided by l, as a start.

151
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:22,160
But now, I have to multiply it
by the cross sectional area of

152
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,960
each one of those loops.

153
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,130
And in a somewhat simplified
way, am I thinking now of it

154
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,780
as having N of these
circular loops.

155
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,190
Which of course is not
exactly accurate.

156
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,490
But it's a very good
approximation for this

157
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,630
staircase type surface
that moves up.

158
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,810
So now I must multiply it by N,
so I get an N square here.

159
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:46,300
And I know have the
current I thru.

160
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,030
Which pokes through N times.

161
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:52,410

162
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:56,880
And here is my pi r squared.

163
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,840
I already have the I, sorry.

164
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,360
This is B. I must multiple
B by N, that

165
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,960
gives me a N squared.

166
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,940
And I must multiply it by the
area, which is pi r squared.

167
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,850
That is no extra I here.

168
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:22,910
This term is called the
self inductance.

169
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,780
It's just a name, it's
purely geometry.

170
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,300

171
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,690
It is nothing else.

172
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:35,790
So this is simply called L times
I. And it is no surprise

173
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,680
that L is proportional
to N squared.

174
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,340
One N comes in when you
calculate the magnetic field.

175
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,340
That's proportional with N. And
the other N comes in when

176
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,610
you recognize that the
current pokes N times

177
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,750
through that surface.

178
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,430
OK, so this is the magnetic
flux going

179
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,100
through my open surface.

180
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,490
And if you ever need the time
derivative, well then you

181
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,050
would get L dI dt.

182
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,020
And of course you have here,
this minus sign.

183
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:13,390
If your solenoids, were a
toroidal system, with radius r

184
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:18,630
zero, then this L simply
became 2 pi r zero.

185
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,580
And if you look at page 976 of
your book, that's exactly what

186
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,640
you find for a toroidal
surface.

187
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,630
Now that we have prepared this,
and we keep in mind that

188
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:36,770
the open surface integral
B.dA equals LI.

189
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,660
We can now tackle, easily,
problem number eight.

190
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,850
Which is the last problem that
I will do today from the

191
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,250
assignment.

192
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,300
It's not the last problem that
I will do today, but the last

193
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,780
from the assignment.

194
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,320
Plus minus.

195
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,570
The switch as one.

196
00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:00,270

197
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,520
Switch as two.

198
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,670

199
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,920
Resistance, R. This point
is called a, this

200
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,990
point is called b.

201
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:14,360
Self inductance, which
we now understand.

202
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,280
We call a solenoid a
self inductance.

203
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,620
The R was 400 Ohms and the L has
an SI value of 0.2, which

204
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,480
is units of Henry.

205
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,460
I close S1.

206
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,080
The current will increase
through this circuits, nothing

207
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,180
through here.

208
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,100
L will oppose the current, but
ultimately L can no longer

209
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,350
fight the current.

210
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,660
And that is going to be a
current flowing through here.

211
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:43,180
And E which is the E mf of
the battery, through

212
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,480
Ohm's Law equals IR.

213
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,170
And so I, you can easily
calculate, equals 0.3 Amperes.

214
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,990

215
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,120
At that moment, I close
S1 one and I open S2.

216
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,340
And let's assume I can do
that at the same time.

217
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,660
So my circuit now, looks
rather different.

218
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,500

219
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,720
I know have a circuit
that looks like so.

220
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,480

221
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:20,310
R, L, 400, 0.2.

222
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,500
And I have at one particular
moment in time, and the

223
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,100
current changes with time,
the current will decrease

224
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,740
in time, I of t.

225
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,970
There is an electric field
only in the resistor.

226
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,210
There is no electric field
in the self inductance.

227
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,470
The self inductance is made
of super conducting wire.

228
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,840
No electric field in here.

229
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,040
We call this point a.

230
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,640
We call this point b.

231
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,890
And we call this point c.

232
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,610
And at time, t equals zero,
we have 0.3 amperes.

233
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:53,110

234
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,720
L is opposing the decay
of the current.

235
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,900
Of course, it will decay
because there is heat

236
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,510
dissipation in the resistor.

237
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,320
But L has the ability
to oppose that.

238
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,520
It slows the decay down.

239
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:12,690
I use Faraday's law, which says
an induced E m f is the

240
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:21,580
closed loop integral of E.dl,
and that equals minus d / dt

241
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,053
times the integral over the
open surface B.dA .

242
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:28,500

243
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,490
Is an open surface and through
here is that peculiar

244
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,330
staircase surface.

245
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:40,490
Whenever I go around, I told
you earlier, I always

246
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,860
disciplined myself to always go
around in the direction of

247
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,870
the surface.

248
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:48,430
Then I never get into trouble
with positive

249
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,320
plus and minus signs.

250
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,400
I already know, by the way, that
is current is decreasing.

251
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,230
So clearly what the self
inductance will do, it will

252
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,110
try to keep the current going
in this direction.

253
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,760
And so it will try to introduce
an E induced in this

254
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,020
direction to keep the
current going.

255
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:15,030
It fights the decay
of the current.

256
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,180
So I've been going
around this way.

257
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,620
I start at point a.

258
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:26,140
Closed loop integral of E.dl,
and I'm going to cut it in

259
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,400
three sections.

260
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:36,060
In going from a to b, through
the resistor, E.dl plus in

261
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,890
going from b through c through
the self inductor, I just put

262
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,940
an L here, which is my
short hand notation.

263
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:48,340
Plus back from say, c to
a through the wire.

264
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:54,460
And that now equals
minus d/dt B.dA .

265
00:14:54,460 --> 00:15:04,760
And this value, we already
know, equals L times I.

266
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,890
What is the integral a to b of
E.dl through the resistor.

267
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,720
There's an E field in this
direction, it is

268
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,140
positive, and it is IR.

269
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,040
At that moment in time,
but I'll drop that t.

270
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,070
What is the integral E.dl
through self inductor?

271
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,380
It's obviously zero.

272
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,800
Because the self inductor is
made of super conducting wire.

273
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,860
There is no electric field
inside the self inductor.

274
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,910
So this is zero.

275
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,300
Here again, there is
no electric field.

276
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,010
And so that's also zero.

277
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,060
And so what do I get?

278
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:41,400
I get IR equals minus
d/dt times LI.

279
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,520
And so, I want to stress, by the
way, that Kirchhoff's law

280
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,180
is for the birds.

281
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,560
The closed loop integral going
around all the way back to

282
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,130
point a, is not zero.

283
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,190
It is minus L dI / dt.

284
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:00,450
Know Kirchhoff's law, don't
let anyone mislead you or

285
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,680
persuade you.

286
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:08,520
So I get IR equals minus L
dI/dt, I bring the L dI/dt

287
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,040
inside, there's nothing
wrong with that.

288
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,280
Plus L dI/dt equals zero.

289
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,910
And I get as a solution, you
shouldn't have too many

290
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,400
difficulties finding this.

291
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,270
The decaying E fields.

292
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,320
And it decays in the
following fashion.

293
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,160
With a decay time tau, which
is L over R, which in our

294
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,160
case, equals 5 times 10 to
the minus 4 seconds.

295
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,530
