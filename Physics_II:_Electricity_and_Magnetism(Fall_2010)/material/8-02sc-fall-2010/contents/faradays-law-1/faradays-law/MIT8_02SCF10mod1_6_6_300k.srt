1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,530

2
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,590
That brings me now to the last
problem, which is Problem 5,

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,654
which is 30-42, my
last problem.

4
00:00:13,654 --> 00:00:16,260

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,970
A little bit of a mathematical
problem perhaps, I have a

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:29,490
current 'i' here, and I have,
here, a loop, and the loop has

7
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,180
length 'l'.

8
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:38,430
This distance is little 'a',
this distance is little 'b',

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:47,940
and I have a changing current,
'di/dt.' Well, first of all

10
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,510
the current 'i' will produce
a magnetic field pointing

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:55,220
everywhere on this side, in the
paper and everywhere on

12
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,970
this side out of the paper,
but we're only

13
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:00,250
concerned on this side.

14
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:06,270
The 'di/dt' will make the
current grow, and so 'i', as a

15
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,690
function of time, equals some
'i0', time equals 0, plus

16
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,030
'di/dt' times 't'.

17
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,080
It's growing linearly.

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,730
Lenz's Law, Faraday's Law,
says I don't like that.

19
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:26,200
I don't like this magnetic field
in the paper to grow; I

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,490
don't like the magnetic flux
through this surface to grow,

21
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,250
and so what does it do?

22
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:39,600
It creates a 'B induced'
in this direction.

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,420
How can you get a 'B induced'
in this direction?

24
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:47,850
It's only possible if you have
an 'i induced' in this loop in

25
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,090
this direction.

26
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:57,330
Therefore, electric fields
in the wires that contain

27
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,350
resistance in this direction.

28
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:05,330
Now, how are you going
to go about it?

29
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,080
The growing magnetic fields
will give a growing flux

30
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,590
through this surface, and
that gives you, then, a

31
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:15,380
counterclockwise induced
current.

32
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,370

33
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:26,170
To calculate the change of the
magnetic flux, we have the

34
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,130
closed loop integral
of 'E dot dl'--

35
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,650

36
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,930
I'm only worried about
magnetic flux,

37
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,380
about absolute values.

38
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,820
I don't care about
minus signs.

39
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:46,400
That is 'd/dt' times the
integral of 'B dot dA' over

40
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,656
that open surface.

41
00:02:48,656 --> 00:02:54,880
And now, what I have to do to
calculate this properly, I

42
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,990
have to take a slice
out of here.

43
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:00,000

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,030
I take a slice out of here at
distance 'r', and the width of

45
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,840
the slice is 'dr'.

46
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,520
And the magnetic field at that
position 'r', away from this

47
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,550
wire with current 'i', is
something that you, by now,

48
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:20,010
know by heart, is 'mu 0 i'
divided by '2 pi r'.

49
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,760
So the magnetic flux, the
teeny-weeny, little magnetic

50
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,040
flux going through this small
narrow ribbon, of which 'dr'--

51
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,680
'd phi r', this is the magnetic

52
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,180
flux at location 'r'--

53
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,600
is the magnetic field times
the surface area--

54
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,990
since this was 'l'--

55
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,220
which is 'ldr'.

56
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,440
And so, if I do an integral of
the magnetic flux; then I have

57
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,130
to do an integral all the way
from 'a' to 'b' of that

58
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,120
magnetic field 'ldr'.

59
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,920
Here's the surface area.

60
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,090
I integrate 'r' from 'a' to
'b', and what do I find?

61
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:08,560
'Mu 0' times 'i' times 'l'
divided by '2 pi' times the

62
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,560
logarithm of 'b/a' , because
remember 'Br' is inversely

63
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,110
proportional to 'r'.

64
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,780
I think we're done, because all
you now have to do, and

65
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:24,940
you are perfectly capable of
doing that yourself, you now

66
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,070
have to take the time derivative
of phi that gives

67
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,210
you the phi dt.

68
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,420
And once you know the phi dt,
you know the integral E dot

69
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,420
dl, and you can calculate
the induced current.

70
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,230
So it's simply a matter now, of
taking the time derivative

71
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,090
of this one, and what you are
going to see is that what is

72
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:46,910
very important is the magnitude
of 'di/dt' .

73
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,050
The larger 'di/dt'
, the larger the

74
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,530
induced emf in the system.
