1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,700
We have here some area in which
we have a magnetic field

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,020
which is pointing in
the blackboard.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,680
We have an initial field
pointing in the blackboard

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,490
which is 0.8 Tesla.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,690
And we have a 'Db/ dt', the
magnetic field is gradually

7
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,570
becoming smaller and smaller,
weaker and weaker.

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,540
That's why we have
the minus sign.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:36,140
Of 0.045 Tesla per second.

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,100
The field is decaying,
so to speak.

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,500
So if you want to know what 'B'
is at any moment in time,

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,970
you would have plus 0.8, if
I call plus going into the

13
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:53,460
paper, minus 0.045 times 'T'.

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,380
And if you wait long
enough then the

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,640
field will even reverse.

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,040
It will come out of the paper.

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:11,440
We have right here concentric
a wire loop.

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,810
The while loop has
a radius 'R'.

19
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,740
Oh that's actually a terrible
thing to do.

20
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,990
Let's not do that.

21
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,950

22
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:32,120
Let's give it a radius 'd.' And
let's give the resistance

23
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,030
of this wire a capital 'R'.

24
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,220
Otherwise we get too
much confusion.

25
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,950
This is point 'a' and this is
point 'b' on that wire.

26
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:46,020

27
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,490
Well, the resistance of the wire
is uniformly distributed

28
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,660
and we are now asked what is
the induced current in this

29
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:01,680
loop when this magnetic field
is slowly decaying?

30
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:10,900
First of all, what is the
meaning of this minus sign in

31
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,450
this equation?

32
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,850
We also refer to that minus sign
sometimes as Lenz's law.

33
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,400
The meaning is the following,
and once you understand the

34
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,030
meaning you can actually in your
calculations completely

35
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:25,580
forget the minus sign,
you will see why.

36
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,300
The meaning is the following:
the magnetic field in this

37
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,400
case in the paper is gradually
decreasing.

38
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,840
The induced current in this loop
will now try to oppose

39
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,040
the change.

40
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,540
And the changes that the
magnetic field, which is in

41
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,890
down direction, gets weaker
and weaker and weaker.

42
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,030
The system opposes that, and
therefor the system will try

43
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,740
to keep the field pointing in
the paper as much as possible.

44
00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:00,680
And the only way it can do that
is by driving an induced

45
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,170
current in clockwise direction,
because that will

46
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,950
give you an induce 'B' field in
this direction, which will

47
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,640
oppose to change.

48
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,250
Namely, that the 'B' field
becomes weaker

49
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,930
and weaker and weaker.

50
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:21,110
So inside this wire there must
be an electric field that must

51
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,610
be building up which will
be driving this current.

52
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,860

53
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,720
Now, we're now going to
apply Faraday's law.

54
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,700
A big moment in our life.

55
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,240
Closed loop integral
of 'E dot dl'.

56
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,760
This is my loop.

57
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,950
What is my surface?

58
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,370
Open service attached
to the loop?

59
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,520
I might as well choose
this one.

60
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,410
Radius little 'd'.

61
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:59,970
This now, we call that the
EMF, acts like a battery.

62
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,110
There's no battery in there,
but yet there's an electric

63
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,870
field that is generated and
there's a current flowing.

64
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,600
We call that the EMF.

65
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,190
Electromotive force.

66
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:22,940
That now equals minus 'dB/
dt' times 'pi d squared'.

67
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:26,530
Times this surface, because
'B' is the same everywhere

68
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,820
inside this surface
so it's very easy

69
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,100
to execute the integral.

70
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:41,790
That also equals 'E', which is
the electric field, times '2

71
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:45,430
pi' times 'd'.

72
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:53,100
Because when I go around 'E
dot dl', E is the same

73
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:58,390
everywhere, so you get
'E' times '2 pi d'.

74
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,870
I would suggest that you forget
about minus signs, that

75
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,640
you take absolute values
everywhere, because we already

76
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,050
know that the induced current
is in this direction.

77
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,150
There's really no need
to carry any

78
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,500
further these minus signs.

79
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,960
You know what 'dB/ dt' is.

80
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,180
You know what 'B' is.

81
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,040
So you calculate what
the EMF is.

82
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,380
You can calculate what 'E'
because you know what 'd' is.

83
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,410
Now you have the EMF, you can
now calculate that the induced

84
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,210
current is that EMF
divided by the

85
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,560
resistance 'R' of the wire.

86
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,470

87
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:45,050
This allows you to calculate
what current is going to flow.

88
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,720
So far, so good.

89
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,900
I don't think you're
going to have a

90
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,650
problem up to this point.

91
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,760
Now comes the part where it
becomes very non-intuitive.

92
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,710
Young is asking you what is
the potential difference

93
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,630
between point 'a'
and point 'b'.

94
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,310
And that is a nonsense question
because it depends on

95
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,720
the routing, how you
go from 'a' to 'b'.

96
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,710
I would like to make a different
drawing to make my

97
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:19,780
point as clear as
I possibly can.

98
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,600
Here is only that inner loop.

99
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,620
Here is point 'a' and
here is point 'b'.

100
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,320

101
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,850
And the electric field, I'll put
it in red now, is in this

102
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,770
direction, this direction, this

103
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,240
direction, this direction.

104
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,360
Notice that the integral
of 'E dot dl' is not 0.

105
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,580
It's a non-conservative field.

106
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,850
Kirchhoff's Law no
longer holds.

107
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,160
But now comes the non-intuitive
part.

108
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:58,760
If I march from a to b along
this line, then the integral,

109
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:06,110
in going from 'a' to 'b' of
'E dot dl' is positive.

110
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,610
You can see 'E' and 'dl' are
in the same direction.

111
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,410
And it happens to be,
if I did not make a

112
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:14,550
mistake, plus 0.7 minivolts.

113
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:20,210
If, however, I walk in this
direction notice that my 'E'

114
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,990
and my 'dl' are in opposite
directions.

115
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,770
So the dot product will give
me a minus sign and so here

116
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,820
the integral in going
from 'a' to 'b' of

117
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,640
'E dot dl' is negative.

118
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,980
It happens to be minus
0.7 minivolts.

119
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,570

120
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,330
Suppose I walk this way.

121
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,100
Exactly through the middle, then
the integral of 'E dot

122
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:52,805
dl' from 'a' to 'b' equals 0.

123
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,430

124
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:02,580
If I put the line slightly here
the trajectory, the path,

125
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,020
will be larger than 0.

126
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:09,780
If I put it on this side it'll
be smaller than 0.

127
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,980
So, you see, it is completely
ill defined.

128
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,730

129
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,600
I can go even further
and show you the

130
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:23,540
absurdity of Young's question.

131
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:30,420
If I have here point 'a' and I
have here point 'b', and if I

132
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:36,420
choose a closed loop, which
starts at a and goes around

133
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,990
and around and around and around
and around and around

134
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,050
and around and around and
finally attach it to point

135
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:52,110
'b', then it's a closed loop
and I do 100,000 windings.

136
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:58,560
Then the integral from 'a' to
'b' of 'E dot dl', believe it

137
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,380
or not is plus 700 volts.

138
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,130
That's to say if I start
in this direction.

139
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,470
If I start in this direction,
than it is minus 700 volts.

140
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,070
Can you now say that 'a'
is at a 700 volt

141
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,360
potential higher than 'b'?

142
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,820
That's nonsense.

143
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:20,680
Because you go this way, then
it is 700 volts below 'b'.

144
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,310
How real is this 700 volts?

145
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,070
Can you actually measure
these voltages?

146
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,500
And the answer is yes.

147
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,410
If, for instance, in my previous
example, if I had a

148
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,900
wire here, and I had a volt
meter here straight through

149
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,740
the middle, this volt
meter would read 0.

150
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,480
If I had a wire here and a volt
meter here and attach it

151
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,640
here this volt meter would
read plus 0.7 minivolts.

152
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,740
Was it 0.7?

153
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,850
It was 7.

154
00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:00,690
If I had a volt meter here in
this line, then this one would

155
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,710
read minus 7 minivolts.

156
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:07,880
And if I put a volt meter here
in this line which has 100,000

157
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,490
windings, that volt meter would
read plus 700 volts.

158
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,070
That's the whole idea
behind transformers.

159
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:22,120
So, I hope it will stick that
the concept of potential

160
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,950
difference between two points is
no longer defined when you

161
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,920
deal with a non-conservative
field.

162
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,550
And that's always the case
when the magnetic flux,

163
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,240
through a surface, attached to
closed loop is changing.

164
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,460
And it is sad, truly sad,
that Young does

165
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,410
not understand that.
