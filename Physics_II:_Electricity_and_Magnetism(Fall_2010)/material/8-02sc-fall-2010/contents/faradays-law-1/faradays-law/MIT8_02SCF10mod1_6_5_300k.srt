00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,950

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,880
PROFESSOR: Problem 4 is 30-21.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:23,550
Here, linear axis: 0, 'L',
'2L', '-L', '-2L'.

4
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,210
And here in space, perhaps a
little bit artificial, I have

5
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:35,280
an area '2L' by '2L', which has
a magnetic field pointing

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,080
in the paper, and the
magnetic field is

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,260
constant in the paper.

8
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:53,480
Here I have a loop, which has
sides, capital 'L', and that

9
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,210
loop is being moved by me with
a certain velocity, 'v',

10
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,050
dragged into this
magnetic field.

11
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,640

12
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,170
And I'm being asked now, what is
the induced current in this

13
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:11,270
loop as a function of position,
and what is the

14
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,930
force of this loop as a
function of position.

15
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,880
I, Walter Lewin, have
to drag it in.

16
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,010
Is it positive force to
the right or is it a

17
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:18,930
force to the left?

18
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,270
Do I have to push it?

19
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,880
Maybe it sucks in itself.

20
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,970
I will use this point 'P'
as my reference point

21
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,220
relative to this axis.

22
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,000
Follow me closely.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,740
Before 'P' reaches this point,
there is no magnetic flux

24
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,920
change; it's 0, so there cannot
be any induced current.

25
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,280
The moment that 'P' hits '-L'
there is going to be an

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,370
increased magnetic flux
through this surface.

27
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,310
This is the surface attached
to my loop, it's an open

28
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,860
surface; and therefore, there
will be an induced current.

29
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,710
The magnetic flux is increasing,
and therefore,

30
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:02,810
there will be an induced
current.

31
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,860
If the magnetic flux is
increasing in this direction,

32
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,110
the current that will flow
will try to oppose that

33
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:17,790
increase, and so it will create
an induced magnetic

34
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,560
field in this direction, so
that the flux in the paper

35
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,200
doesn't grow so fast. Once the
loop is completely inside,

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,490
that means once point 'P'
reaches 0, there is no longer

37
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,920
any flux change, and so there
is no longer any induced

38
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,410
current, and the current
will stop once it

39
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,380
reaches this point.

40
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:49,470
And all the way from here to
here, 'P' being here to here,

41
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,340
the magnetic flux
will not change.

42
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,730
But the moment that 'P' emerges
here, the magnetic

43
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,790
flux, which is in this
direction, is changing again.

44
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,510
It's losing magnetic flux,
so something is

45
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,860
going to happen again.

46
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:07,250
I will do the early part of the
problem, and you will then

47
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,720
do the second part
of the problem.

48
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,450

49
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:22,290
Well, the magnetic flux change,
'd phi dt', when 'P'

50
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,600
begins to move into the magnetic
field equals 'vBL'.

51
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,200

52
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Every second the magnetic flux
increases with a value, which

53
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,442
is 'B' times the increase in
surface area, and the increase

54
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:43,100
in surface area is 'vL', and so
the closed loop integral of

55
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,580
'E dot dl' along the loop
that I have chosen--

56
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,820
and let's not worry about signs,
because we know the

57
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,640
direction anyhow--

58
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:56,790
equals 'vBL', and we already
determined that in the loop

59
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,930
when it starts to enter the
magnetic field the induced

60
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,760
current will be in this
direction, so the induced

61
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:11,010
electric field will be
in this direction.

62
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,350
That's the 'E' field in this
loop, and if you want to know

63
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:20,090
what the induced current is,
well, that is the EMF value,

64
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:26,320
which is 'vBL' divided by the
resistance of this circuit, if

65
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,340
'R', capital 'R' is the
resistance of that circuit.

66
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,550
What is the force
on this loop?

67
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,620
Well, there are two ways
that you can do this.

68
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:45,280
One way is to say, aha, I have
this wire here, which has

69
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,990
length 'L', I'll make
a new drawing.

70
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,610
This wire, which has length 'L',
it has a current flowing

71
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,750
through it, which is 'i
induced', which we just

72
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,850
calculated.

73
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,200
It has a magnetic field, 'B'--

74
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,810
I should really make
it black--

75
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,530
'B', in the paper, which is this
external field, and so

76
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:10,270
the force on the wire equals
'i' times 'L' times 'B'.

77
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,830
This is part of Assignment
5, and that

78
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,280
force is in this direction.

79
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,750
Remember, it is the
cross-product between 'i',

80
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,350
'L', and 'B', and if you take
that into account, you'll see

81
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,810
that it is in this direction.

82
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:31,760
But I, Walter Lewin, have to
push this in, have to pull it

83
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,420
in, so my force, 'F', Walter
Lewin, is in magnitude the

84
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,660
same, but it is to the right.

85
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,060
And therefore, notice that
I do positive work.

86
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,700
I do positive work, because the
force is to the right, and

87
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,960
I'm dragging it to the right.

88
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,120
That's one way of doing it.

89
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,020
There's another way, which I
like, and that is: as the

90
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,820
current is flowing in here,
there is power dissipated in

91
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,170
that loop, which has a
resistance 'R', and that power

92
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,060
is 'i squared R'.

93
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,930
That's the amount of work per
second that is released in the

94
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,490
form of heat in this
whole loop.

95
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,650
Now, who is going to provide
that work per second?

96
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,930
That's Walter Lewin; so this
must be the force by Walter

97
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,310
Lewin by the velocity with
which I drag it through.

98
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,340
Remember this is also power,
and if you solve this

99
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,760
equation, you will find
exactly the same

100
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,700
value for my force.

101
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,620
It must give the same answer,
and I think you should

102
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,940
convince yourself, both methods
give the same answer.

103
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:43,160
If I make a drawing, a sketch,
of the induced current as a

104
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:57,180
function of this linear
dimension: 'L', '2L', 0, '-L',

105
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:03,300
'-2L', and if I draw here, 'i
induced', then we would agree

106
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,900
that when point 'P'-- this is
all relative to point 'P'--

107
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,865
when 'P' is outside
capital 'L', there

108
00:07:08,865 --> 00:07:11,520
is no induced current.

109
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,900
Instantaneously, when 'P'
penetrates a magnetic field,

110
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:22,330
it goes to a value 'BvL' divided
by 'R', and I called

111
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:26,040
this negative, but it's really
a counter-clockwise current,

112
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,360
and I would like to call a
clockwise current positive.

113
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,790
Then while it's inside all the
way from 0 to 'L', there is,

114
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,140
again, no flux change--

115
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,520
I stress that point,
here it is, again--

116
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,300
when the loop is in here, all
the way marching up to here

117
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,540
there is no flux change, so the
induced current goes to 0,

118
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,560
and this, now, is the part all
the way on the right side,

119
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,090
here, you do.

120
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,650

121
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,020
I think you have all the
ingredients, now.

122
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,070
You should have no problem.
