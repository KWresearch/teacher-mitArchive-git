1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,300
Problem number one is a huge
solenoid, one that is used for

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,610
nuclear magnetic resonance.

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:22,160
It has a cross-sectional
circular radius of 0.5 meters,

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,930
it has a huge length of 2.5
meters, so that the whole body

6
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:26,935
can go in there.

7
00:00:26,935 --> 00:00:29,870
It is used for medical
purposes.

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,520
The magnetic field
is quite strong.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,160
It is half a Tesla.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,650
It's a huge machine.

11
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,440
The first question is
how much energy is

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,620
stored in that machine?

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:47,300
The magnetic energy per cubic
meter, joules per cubic meter,

14
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,430
is given by this relationship,
and you have seen

15
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,990
this several times.

16
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,970
If I multiply this by the volume
of the solenoid, then I

17
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,690
should get the total energy.

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,270
I've made the assumption,
then, which is an

19
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,320
approximation, that the magnetic
field is constant in

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,740
the solenoid, it's zero outside,
and it's also zero

21
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,980
outside near the ends of
the solenoid, which

22
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,260
we know is not true.

23
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,160
This is a reasonable
approximation.

24
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,960
The volume equals pi r
squared, which is the

25
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,320
cross-section through the
solenoid, and the

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,140
length equals l.

27
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:24,870
I put in the numbers, and I find
very roughly 2 times 10

28
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,030
to the sixth joules.

29
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:31,010
This you should consider as
a somewhat rough answer.

30
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:36,800
How much current goes around a
ring which has a width of 1

31
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,270
centimeter?

32
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:45,110
We'll have to revisit the
solenoids, and go back to some

33
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:49,660
earlier calculations that
we have made to

34
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,870
refresh your memory.

35
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,340
Let's suppose this solenoid
has length l, it has N

36
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,460
windings, and the current
through each winding is I, and

37
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,230
we don't know either
one of them.

38
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,410
We make the assumption, perhaps
a little bit naive,

39
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,140
that the magnetic field only
exists inside the solenoid,

40
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,520
and that it is constant and that
it is this 1/2 ampere--

41
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,950
not ampere, 1/2 tesla.

42
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,620
I now use Ampere's Law to
calculate this magnetic field

43
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,150
in a way that you have
seen many times.

44
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,940
I take a closed loop.

45
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,330
Let this length be y, and
this length be y.

46
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,110
This is very far away.

47
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:36,280
I assume the magnetic field is
always in this direction, and

48
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,990
so when I calculate the dot
product from Ampere's Law,

49
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:46,590
integral B dot dl, I only have
a contribution through this

50
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,280
part, because B is perpendicular
here to dl

51
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,530
inside the solenoid.

52
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,300
It's also perpendicular
to dl here.

53
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,640
Here the magnetic field is very
weak, and certainly when

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,220
we take this very far out,
the contribution is

55
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,190
approximately zero.

56
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,690
I would only get, then, if I
go around this closed-loop

57
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:10,740
circle in this direction, I
would get only v times y.

58
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,845
That equals I through
this open surface.

59
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:21,850
This is mu 0 times I through
plus mu 0 times the

60
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,610
displacement current.

61
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,740
Don't confuse this with DC,
which is the displacement

62
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,660
current, and there is no
displacement current.

63
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:34,880
Now comes the question, how
many times does this I go

64
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,860
through this surface?

65
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,150
It penetrates through this
surface many times, so we get

66
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:47,520
B times y equals mu 0, and y
divided by l times N is the

67
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,670
number of times that it
penetrates through this

68
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:57,380
surface at these locations times
I. I find that IN equals

69
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,870
B times l divided by mu 0.

70
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:06,140
You realize, of course,
that the y cancels.

71
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,900
If you wanted to the equation in
terms of B, then you would

72
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:16,430
have mu 0 time N times
I divided by l.

73
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,160
This, by the way, would mean,
just to give you some feeling

74
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,850
for it, that if--

75
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,900
I'm not saying that's the
case, but if I were 100

76
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:31,410
amperes, then it would mean that
N would be very roughly

77
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:38,990
10 to the 4 windings, because
when I calculate IN, I know B,

78
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:42,100
I know l, and I know mu
0, so I find very

79
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,300
roughly 10 to the 6 amperes.

80
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,420
That's the meaning of IN the
way I have derived it.

81
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,130
Now, I'm going to look at this
cylinder, not as individual

82
00:04:55,130 --> 00:05:02,690
windings, but I'm going to
look at it literally as a

83
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:13,750
shell cylinder open here, with
length l, and there is this

84
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,820
combined current going through
all these end wires.

85
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,630
They're going around and around
and around, making this

86
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,720
magnetic field like so.

87
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,170
Suppose I took a knife, and
I cut through here.

88
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:31,480
I really don't want to cut, but
I want to have a surface

89
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,850
here that cuts here through
all these currents that go

90
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,620
through here N times.

91
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,570
What, then, is the total
current that goes

92
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,390
through that sheet?

93
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,150
Well, that, of course, is
10 to the sixth amperes.

94
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,140
I just calculated it.

95
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:51,730
Now, I don't take a length l,
but I take something more

96
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:57,480
modest: I take a ring of which
this is only 1 centimeter, and

97
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,870
now I want to calculate how much
current goes through that

98
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,090
1 centimeter, so it's
immediately obvious that it is

99
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:08,290
10 to the sixth amperes divided
by 250, and that is 4

100
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:12,680
times 10 to the 3 amperes, going
only through this ring,

101
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,450
which has a thickness
of 1 centimeter.

102
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,200
Professor Bertschinger is now
asking you what is the outside

103
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:28,820
force on this 1 centimeter
ring?

104
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:34,100
I would like to make a
picture from above.

105
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,430
This is this ring, and it has
a thickness of 1 centimeter

106
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,410
going into the paper.

107
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:43,640
It has a current going in this
direction, and the magnetic

108
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,200
field, which we have assumed
was pointing upwards, is

109
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:54,140
inside B. This is a half
Tesla B field.

110
00:06:54,140 --> 00:07:05,695
We know that the dF equals I
times dl cross B. It is a

111
00:07:05,695 --> 00:07:08,060
cross product.

112
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,830
If I take here a little element
dl, in that I'm always

113
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,470
in the direction of the current,
then you can check

114
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,180
for yourself that the dl
cross B is a force

115
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,590
that is pointing outwards--

116
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,760
it's a little force dF--

117
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,510
and that force will be radially
pointing outwards

118
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,760
everywhere.

119
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,610

120
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:40,080
This radius will be little r.

121
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,210
Even though the net force on
these ring is zero, because

122
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,760
all these forces average out
to be 0, I'm sure that

123
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,880
Professor Bertschinger had in
mind that he wanted you to

124
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:59,390
integrate over the a
circumference 2 pi r the force

125
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,490
sort of like this.

126
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,070
I don't quite know how
to express it.

127
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,910
I would have phrased just
slightly differently, but I

128
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,350
think his intentions
are quite clear.

129
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,320
What that would mean is that the
total force, if you add up

130
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,160
all those radial force outwards,
would be I, which is

131
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,660
in this ribbon of 1 centimeter
times 2 pi r, which is the

132
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,560
circumference times
B. That's this B,

133
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,640
because the cross product--

134
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:31,160
you can forget the cross,
because the I and B aren't at

135
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,700
90 degree angles with respect
to each other.

136
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,370
We know that this value is 4
times 10 to the third, we know

137
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:47,760
2 pi r and B, and you
find 6,280 newtons.

138
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,040
This value, however, is
definitely too high, because I

139
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,130
have assumed now that the
individual windings of the

140
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,080
solenoids are all completely
emerged in that field of half

141
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,160
tesla, and that's
not the case.

142
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,850
Outside the solenoids, through
reasonable approximation, the

143
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,720
magnetic field is zero.

144
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,320
Inside the solenoid,
it is half tesla.

145
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,740
It is more reasonable, as is
suggested by Professor

146
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,840
Bertschinger to choose for a
mean magnetic field half the

147
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,950
value of the field inside.

148
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,700
Instead of half tesla, we should
take one quarter tesla.

149
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:29,760
Therefore, the actual force
that you would experience,

150
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,180
then, is this value
divided by 2.

151
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,496
This is the sum, then, of all
these forces as they are

152
00:09:36,496 --> 00:09:37,746
pointing outwards.

153
00:09:37,746 --> 00:09:40,675

154
00:09:40,675 --> 00:09:44,480
A more reasonable question
is what is the

155
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,800
pressure on this ring?

156
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,472
Pressure, equal the force,
divided by the area.

157
00:09:52,472 --> 00:09:57,540
The force is now 3,140 newtons,
which is half of

158
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,580
6,280, and I must multiply
that by 2 pi r, the

159
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,730
circumference of the ring.

160
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:06,810
The ring has a height
of 1 centimeter.

161
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:11,960
I work in mks units, and I find
10 to the 5 newtons per

162
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,930
square meter, which
is 1 atmosphere.

163
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,330
This is an overpressure.

164
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:23,880
Clearly, the air pressure
outside and inside the

165
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,410
solenoid is 1 atmosphere.

166
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:31,080
As a result of this current and
this magnetic field which

167
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,210
produced by the current, there
is an overpressure over and

168
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,590
above the equilibrium, 1
atmosphere in, and 1

169
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,290
atmosphere out, which
is trying to

170
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,020
blow this magnet apart.

171
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:44,640
One atmosphere is quite
a pressure.

172
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,080
There's 1 atmosphere pressure
on your hands, which is 10

173
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,790
newtons for every square
centimeter.

174
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:53,580
Or I like to think in kilogram
forces, so 1 kilogram force

175
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,100
for every square centimeter.

176
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,010
Why don't you implode?

177
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,740
Because there is equilibrium
inside your body, and the

178
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,800
pressure is also 1 atmosphere,
so you do not implode.

179
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,760
If you take a metal can, you
close it properly, and you

180
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,580
suck out the air, then the metal
can will implode, as you

181
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,870
saw last year during
a wonderful

182
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,490
demonstration in 8.01.

183
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,710
The outside force, the
1 kilogram per square

184
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:23,020
centimeter, is not compensated
by a similar pressure from

185
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,160
inside, because you're sucking
the air out, so this

186
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,840
atmospheric pressure can
sometimes be very, very

187
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,400
noticeable.

188
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,010
In the case of the magnet, the
magnet will experience an

189
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,930
overpressure from inside
out of 1 atmosphere.

190
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,820
Now you're being asked, or
you're being told, that the

191
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:52,690
magnetic energy density, which
has the dimensions joules per

192
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,270
square meter--

193
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:59,550
a joule is a newton meter per
cubic meter, so a joule is

194
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,880
also newtons per
square meter--

195
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,510
that this has the same
dimensions as that.

196
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:09,950
If you do calculate 1/2 B
squared divided by mu 0,

197
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,970
which, in this case, is
easy because B is

198
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:14,700
constant in the solenoid.

199
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,790
If B is not constant, then
it's a little harder.

200
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,710
You put in the numbers for B
and for mu 0, what do find?

201
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,620
Lo and behold: you find
the same 2.5--

202
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,900
10 to the power of 5.

203
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,680
So again, you find the
same 1 atmosphere.

204
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,750
In this case, the magnetic
energy density is exactly the

205
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:41,490
same as the overpressure that
the solenoid will experience.

206
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,740
