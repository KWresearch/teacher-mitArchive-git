1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,009

2
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:14,690
We have two coaxial solenoids,
and they each have N windings,

3
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,540
they each have length l, and one
has radius r1, which is a,

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,400
and the other a radius
r2, which is b.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,730
They are in series.

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,910
That means if they're in series,
that the current that

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:28,230
goes through is exactly
the same.

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,170
However, they are wound in such
a way that the magnetic

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,810
field in one is exactly
opposing the magnetic

10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,060
field in the other.

11
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:40,690

12
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,200
As we have just seen, the
magnetic field in one solenoid

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,370
is independent of r.

14
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,490
It is mu 0 times N times the
current through one winding

15
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:56,290
divided by l, independent
of r.

16
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,980
The magnetic field for both
solenoids is identical, except

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,940
that they are in opposite
directions.

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,170
This screams for a superposition
solution.

19
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,070
If I look from above--

20
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,380
so this is the solenoid with
radius b, and this is the

21
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,870
solenoid with radius a--

22
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,490
the magnetic field in this
solenoid, of the inside

23
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:22,870
solenoid, is pointing inwards,
and there is no magnetic field

24
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,620
through a good approximation
outside the solenoid.

25
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,700
The magnetic field of the
solenoid with radius b is

26
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:36,250
everywhere inside at the same
strength as a magnetic field

27
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,580
inside this inner solenoid.

28
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,850
The b here we assume to a good
approximation is zero, and the

29
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,820
b outside this one is also zero,
due to the current of

30
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,830
the inner solenoid and not
due to the current

31
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:53,840
of the outer solenoid.

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,160
The answer to what the magnetic

33
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,480
field is quite simple.

34
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,230
The magnetic field is only
non-zero when r is less than b

35
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,530
and larger than a.

36
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,800
That is the value that you see
here, and b is 0 here, because

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,460
the two fields cancel each
other, and b also 0 outside,

38
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:19,700
so the b is only non-zero
in this hashed area.

39
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:20,510
It's very interesting.

40
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:26,470
You have a doughnut type
of magnetic field.

41
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:31,700
The next question is what
is the self-inductance?

42
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,590
L times I equals magnetic flux,
and the magnetic flux is

43
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,500
always peculiarly defined
in a solenoid.

44
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,860
You have to make this open
surface, which I have

45
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,030
discussed with you before.

46
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:47,860
It is a spiral case surface,
which is very hard to see, but

47
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,200
think of a spiral case that you
may know somewhere, and

48
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,880
think of the surface of that
spiral case, the steps.

49
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,680
That is an open surface, and it
is attached to that closed

50
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,460
loop wire through the
self-inductance, which, of

51
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,110
course has to return somehow
to the other sides.

52
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,190
The magnetic flux, the magnetic
field, penetrates

53
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,600
that staircase surface N times
if you have N windings, and

54
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,200
that's the way you should
really think of this.

55
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,990
When r equals less than a, the
magnetic flux is obviously

56
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,630
zero, because there's
no magnetic field.

57
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:27,620
The only magnetic flux that is
non-zero is the one going

58
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,640
through the [UNINTELLIGIBLE], so
that is when r equals less

59
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,170
than b and larger than a.

60
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,870
There the magnetic flux equals
N, the number of winding,

61
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,610
times the magnetic field going
through each one of those

62
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:45,040
staircase surfaces times the
cross-sectional area where the

63
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,500
magnetic field exists, and
that is this hashed area.

64
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,640
I find LI, which is this phi.

65
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,380
I get an N squared now, because
b has an N in it.

66
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:05,290
I have an I, I have a mu
0, and I have an L--

67
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,370
that's the b field-- and then
the area equals pi times b

68
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,170
squared minus a squared.

69
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,050
Obviously, I lose my I, because
L is only purely a

70
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,940
matter of geometry.

71
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,740
If you look at this, you will
see that only geometry

72
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,810
plays a role here.

73
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,500
Keep in mind that the b is
0 right here at the core.

74
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,203
