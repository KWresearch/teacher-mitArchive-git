1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,270
Now I'll go to problem
number six.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:15,010
Problem number six is 23-14.

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,820
I have a sphere, which is
a solid metal sphere.

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,520
It is solid.

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,050
It's not hollow,
and it's metal.

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:29,800
There is a charge plus
Q on this sphere.

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,230
You're being asked: If the
sphere has a radius capital R,

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,790
what the electric field inside
the sphere is, what is radius

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:45,220
little r, and what it is
outside the sphere.

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,940
I will not assume, which is
something we already know,

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,180
that all the charge will
have to be at the

13
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,770
surface of this sphere.

14
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,680
The reason is that it's a
conductor, it's a metal, and

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,830
there cannot be any charge
inside the sphere.

16
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:05,160
That's not the case if the
sphere were made of glass.

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,370
Then you could have uniformly
distributed charge throughout

18
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,080
the glass, but not
for a metal.

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,790
But now I will first show you
why that is the case, so I

20
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,880
will distribute artificially
the charge uniformly

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,050
throughout this volume.

22
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,310
I'm now going to calculate what
to the E field is at the

23
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,710
location r from the center.

24
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,300
I introduce a Gaussian surface,
which is a sphere.

25
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,125
It has a radius r, and
obviously, there would be an

26
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:43,860
E-field which is pointing
radially outwards, and the

27
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:50,600
elements ds are exactly in
the same direction as E--

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,580
this is ds--

29
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,720
everywhere on this sphere, which
is a concentric sphere.

30
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,470
I apply Gauss' Law with
4 pi r squared--

31
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,190
that's the surface area--

32
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:09,140
times E. Forget the dot, because
the cosine of the

33
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:14,330
angle is plus 1, but that now
must be the charge inside this

34
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,630
sphere divided by epsilon 0.

35
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:24,070
This charge inside the sphere
is not zero, and therefore,

36
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:28,780
what's going to happen is there
is going to be a force

37
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,410
on the electrons.

38
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,760
If I have an electric field, and
there are electrons, they

39
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,920
will experience a force, but the
electrons in a conductor,

40
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,960
in a metal, are free to move, so
they're going to move under

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,860
the inference of the force
imposed on them by the

42
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,600
electric field.

43
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,380
They will not stop moving until
that force is zero, and

44
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,400
that force will only become zero
when the electric field

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,390
has vanished.

46
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,790
So there is no electric
field inside a

47
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,680
conductor that can be possible.

48
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,600
The electrons would
simply kill it.

49
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,160
What is the conclusion?

50
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,980
That the charge must all
be at the surface.

51
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:15,090
I conclude that the E field for
r less than R must be 0.

52
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,650
Now, we will calculate
the electric

53
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,490
fields outside the sphere.

54
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:29,540
I think we should make a
new drawing for that.

55
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:38,840
Radius R, and now I have a
Gaussian surface, which has

56
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,940
radius little r, and the E
fields will be pointing out

57
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,700
radially everywhere, and the
ds's will be pointing out

58
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,110
radially everywhere, and so it's
is very easy now to write

59
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,730
down Gauss' Law.

60
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:00,970
4 pi r squared E of r equals all
the charge, which we know

61
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,030
now is the surface.

62
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:06,260
It's uniformly distributed at
the surface Q divided by

63
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:14,620
epsilon 0, and so we find that
E equals Q divided by 4 pi

64
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,370
epsilon 0 r squared.

65
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,210
Famous result, inversely
proportional to r squared, and

66
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:27,040
this holds as long as r is
larger or equal to R. Of

67
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,130
course, you can put in some
numbers, and then you'll get

68
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,770
some answers.

69
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,280
This is always true.

70
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,050
This is even true if this were
not a metal and if the charges

71
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,170
were uniformly distributed
throughout, then the answer

72
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,970
outside the radius capital
R would still be correct,

73
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,590
because I have still
applied Gauss' Law.

74
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,160
Of course,

75
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,090
if this were glass, and if the
charges were uniformly

76
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:58,080
distributed throughout, then the
electric field inside the

77
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,390
sphere would not be zero.

78
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,030
Maybe you would want to
calculate what it would be as

79
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,110
a function of little r.

80
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,890
Maybe that's a nice
exercise for you.
