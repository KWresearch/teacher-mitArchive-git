1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,060

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:12,600
Now we go to problem number
two, which is 25-22.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,220
It's a classic, and the reason
why it's a classic is because

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,080
Gauss' Law can be applied--

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,470
this is here inside
the sphere.

6
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,130
The inner sphere is metallic--

7
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,710
'R1' that is vacuum--

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,230
and the outer sphere is
also metallic, and has

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,220
the radius 'R2' .

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,190
This is probably
a solid sphere.

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,750
Remember, 'C' is 'Q'
divided by 'V'.

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,650
I will also write the total
energy of the system, which

13
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:49,740
equals '1/2 C V squared', also
'1/2 Q V', and it is also '1/2

14
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,560
Q squared over C'.

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,900
This is all the same: you can
apply any one of these three

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,720
as it suits you.

17
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:59,160
The question now is what is
the potential difference

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,960
between here and here if the
charge on this is '+Q' and the

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,000
charge on here is '-Q'?

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,200
The charge on here will be on
the inside of the sphere--

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,810
I leave you with the exercise
to prove that--

22
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,310
and the charge on the inner
sphere will be on the outside

23
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,900
of the sphere.

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,650
Whenever we have a problem like
that, you always go in

25
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:27,315
two steps: first, you calculate
the 'E' fields in

26
00:01:27,315 --> 00:01:33,750
this gap, and then, two, you do
the integral of 'E dot dl'.

27
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,400
You go from, in this case, 'R1'
to 'R2' , and that's the

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,090
potential difference.

29
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,495
The question now is: what
is the 'E' field

30
00:01:43,495 --> 00:01:46,230
here in this gap?

31
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,750
You apply a Gaussian sphere,
which has the

32
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,320
radius little 'r'--

33
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,480
you have done that several
times, and I will leave you

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,790
with that exercise.

35
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,630
You can prove very easily that
factorially 'E' equals capital

36
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:07,330
'Q' divided by ''4 pi epsilon
0' 'r squared'' times 'r

37
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,870
roof', pointing radially outward
because the inner

38
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,650
sphere is positive.

39
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,790
This holds only as long as 'r'
is smaller than 'R2 and larger

40
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,530
than 'R1' .

41
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,060
Now we want to do the potential
difference--

42
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,660
let me call this point 'a' and
let me call this point 'b'.

43
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,980
It doesn't matter how I go from
the inner sphere to the

44
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,300
outer sphere, so I call
it just 'Va - Vb'.

45
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,490

46
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:43,220
That is now 'Q' divided by '4
pi epsilon 0' times the

47
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:51,370
integral from 'R1' to 'R2' dr
dot 'r root'-- there's a dot

48
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,470
product there--

49
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,390
divided by 'r squared'.

50
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:58,940
As we discussed last time, the
dot product between two

51
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,740
vectors is a scalar--

52
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:06,240
this scalar is nothing but 'dr',
and this integral, then,

53
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,010
becomes a very easy one--

54
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:15,260
it is '1 over R1' minus
'1 over 'R2' .

55
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,790
This is larger than 0, for the
simple reason that 'R1' is

56
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:26,160
smaller than R2 , and so 'Va'
is larger than 'Vb' .

57
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:32,800
What is the total energy
of the system?

58
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,490
You can pick any one of
these equations--

59
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,568
any one of these three, I don't
care which-- you just

60
00:03:39,568 --> 00:03:42,760
pick the one that is the
most convenient.

61
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,780
I would pick '1/2 Q V', because
'Q' was given, 'V' we

62
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,350
just calculated, and so
you're in business.

63
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,260
If you were interested in what
the capacitance is, then you

64
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,830
take 'Q' divided by 'V'.

65
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:02,040
We know 'Q', we just calculated
'V', and so you can

66
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,060
calculate the capacitance.

67
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,820
I want to stress that the
capacitance is independent of

68
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,410
'Q', and it is independent
of 'V'--

69
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,410
it only depends on geometry.

70
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,056
