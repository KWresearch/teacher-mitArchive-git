1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,740

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,900
Let's start with problem
number one.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,580
And I have a little introduction
to problem number

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,670
one that I want to start with.

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:27,260
If I have here what we call a
set of parallel capacitors,

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:34,920
point 'a', point 'b', and 'Va
- Vb', that's called a 'V'.

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,380
Higher here than there.

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,100
And this capacitance is 'C1',
and this capacitance is 'C2'.

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,270
They both see the
same voltage.

10
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,640
Well, it always holds that 'C
of i', which is capacitor i,

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,670
always has a charge 'Q of i'
on it, if the voltage over

12
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,460
that capacitor is 'V of i'.

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,790
This you can always use.

14
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,820
It's always true.

15
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,310
Now both capacitors see the
same voltage over them.

16
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:16,500
So therefore, the 'Q of 1'
equals 'C of 1' times 'V' and

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,960
'Q of 2' equals 'C
of 2' times 'V'.

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,770
And in this particular case,
where the two are parallel,

19
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,760
they have this in common.

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:34,270
And the 'Q's are clearly
different, because the 'C's

21
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,940
are different.

22
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,340
That's called parallel.

23
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:48,290
If now we go to series,
here we have two

24
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:51,290
capacitors in series.

25
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,810
'C1', C2'.

26
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:58,880
Point 'a', positive potential,
point 'b', let's call it 0,

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,800
negative potential.

28
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,680
And again, 'Va - Vb' is V.

29
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,230
Now there's something very
important I want you to

30
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,830
appreciate.

31
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:19,670
This part here has
no net charge.

32
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,960
Because as you connect this to
a battery, no electrons are

33
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,270
supposed to jump through
this vacuum.

34
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,310
It is true that this side
becomes positive of the

35
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,030
capacitor, therefore, this side

36
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,330
becomes negative by induction.

37
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,130
It is true that this side
becomes negative, and

38
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,160
therefore, that this side
of the capacitor

39
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,820
'C2' becomes positive.

40
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,820
But the net results here must
be that the net charge

41
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,140
negative here must exactly
cancel the

42
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,540
positive charge there.

43
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,730
That is very characteristic
for series.

44
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:03,630
Therefore, 'Q1' equals 'Q2' .

45
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:08,810
The charge on here is the same
as the charge on there.

46
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,300
Because charge left is charge
right, and charge left is

47
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,950
charge right.

48
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:20,430
So now we have 'Q' equals 'C1'
times 'V1' and we have 'Q'

49
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,430
equals 'C2' times 'V2'.

50
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,540
And now these two
are the same.

51
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,320
And so now, as you can see,
since 'C1' is not the same as

52
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,480
'C2', the potential difference
over 'C1', which is 'V1', will

53
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,830
be different from the potential

54
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:40,390
difference over 'V2'.

55
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,290
So here, the essential is that
the 'Q' is the same in each

56
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,890
case, but not the potential
difference.

57
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:53,550
If you work this out, then you
could easily show that 'V'

58
00:03:53,550 --> 00:04:01,420
equals that 'Q' times '1 over
C1' plus '1 over 'C2'.

59
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:08,530
And this is often called
'1 over C equivalent'.

60
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,480
The 'C equivalent' is, so to
speak, replacing these two.

61
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:20,730
If you had a parallel set of
capacitors, then that 'C

62
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:25,690
equivalent' would become
'C1 + C2'.

63
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,230
And I'm sure you will have
no problems proving it.

64
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,130
So let's now go to problem
number one, and apply some of

65
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,620
what I've just told you.

66
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:46,740
To really have point 'a
positive', 'C1', 'C2', rather

67
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,970
complicated.

68
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,220
'C3'.

69
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,910

70
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,550
This point is called 'd'.

71
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,420

72
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,670
'C4'.

73
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,470

74
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,520
And here is 'b',
which is minus.

75
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,730
And the potential difference
'Va - Vb' equals 'V'.

76
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,120
And now one of the questions is,
what is the charge on each

77
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,260
of these capacitors?

78
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,100
The first thing I'm going to do,
I'm going to replace these

79
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,700
two by an equivalent
capacitor.

80
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,660
'1 over C1 prime'--

81
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,570
equivalent capacitor would
be 'C1 prime'--

82
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,720
equals '1 over C1'
plus '1 over C2'.

83
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,610
And then I'm going to replace
all 3 by an equivalent

84
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,440
capacitor, which I will
call 'C prime'.

85
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,020

86
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:57,560
And so we now have that 'C
prime' equals 'C3' plus 'C1

87
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,210
prime', which we just
calculated.

88
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:05,290
And so I have now reduced this
circuit to an entirely

89
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,050
different circuit.

90
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:13,910
I have now here 'C prime', and I
know how large 'C prime' is.

91
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,160
Then I have 'C4'.

92
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,220

93
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:24,080
This point is 'd', this
is 'a', and this is b.

94
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,740
Check for yourself, this
is exactly what

95
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,390
the circuit is now.

96
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:32,180
And if you go back to my
introduction, then the 'Q' on

97
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,390
'C prime' must be the 'Q' on
'C4', two capacitors in

98
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:42,940
series, and therefore,
I will call this 'Q'.

99
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,140
And so it's very easy to
calculate for you now what 'Vc

100
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,980
prime' is, the potential
difference over here, because

101
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:56,020
'C of i' equals 'Q of i' divided
by 'V of i', and it is

102
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,290
also very easy for you to
calculate what the potential

103
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,770
difference is over number 4.

104
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,670

105
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:11,820
Now let's go back to the
original scheme.

106
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:20,710
We have here 'a', and we have
here 'C1', and we have here

107
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,145
'C2', and we have here 'C3'.

108
00:07:24,145 --> 00:07:28,020

109
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,270
This is point 'd'.

110
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,230

111
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,600
OK.

112
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,720
Let's leave it as it is now.

113
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,400

114
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,890
This is between 'a' and 'd'.

115
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,290
And I just leave
4 out for now.

116
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,420
There is a 4 here,
I realize that.

117
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,870
I want you now to concentrate
on this part.

118
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,400

119
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,770
And that part is exactly what I
covered in my introduction.

120
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:00,750
Therefore, 'Q1' must be 'Q2'.

121
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,800
The charge on here must be
the charge on this one.

122
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,330
And I would like you to--

123
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,720
I leave you with the problem.

124
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,250
Because you do know
what 'Va - Vd' is.

125
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,160
You know that because we
just did that only

126
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,050
thirty seconds ago.

127
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,120
So you can calculate now the
charge on here, and you can

128
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,490
calculate the charge on there.

129
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:33,900
'Q3' equals 'C3' times the
potential difference between

130
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,154
'a' and 'd', which we
just calculated.

131
00:08:36,154 --> 00:08:38,675

132
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:41,490
I want to remind you that the
potential difference between

133
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,150
'a' and 'd' is nothing but
the potential difference

134
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,340
over that 'C prime'.

135
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,180
So you know 'Va - Vd' .

136
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,790
And so you can calculate now
charge here, charge there, and

137
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,575
you can calculate charge
there, and I will

138
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,430
leave you with that.

139
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,410
I don't think there's too much
more to this problem.

140
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,100
Rather straightforward, but
it can be a little nasty.
