1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,060

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:12,160
This is number 8 and
this is 25-2.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,680
I have a huge plate.

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,800
There's an area 'A'
and there's a

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,180
charge '+Q' on the plate.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:29,960
And I have at a separation
little 'd', same area 'A', and

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,460
I have '-Q' charge
on this one.

8
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:42,970
Well the electric field outside
these huge plates is

9
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,070
going to be 0, and I want
you to prove that

10
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,840
using Gauss' law.

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,140
'E' is 0 here and
'E' is 0 there.

12
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,360
And it's not because I am lazy,
but I also want you to

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:02,590
prove that the electric field
inside is constant--

14
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:08,220
I already anticipated that
earlier --and that the

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,100
electric field inside 'E' equals
the surface charge

16
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,910
density, 'sigma', divided
by 'epsilon 0'.

17
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,790
And the surface charge density
'sigma' is defined as 'Q' of

18
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,620
one of the plates divided by the
area of one of the plates.

19
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,640
So it is 'Q' divided by 'A'
divided by 'epsilon 0'.

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,550
That is the electric fields
and if the plates are very

21
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,210
large compared to 'd', it
is constant throughout.

22
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,490
There are some fringe
fields here.

23
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,670
We will ignore them and to a
very good approximation will

24
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,340
the 'E' field outside
the plates be 0.

25
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,560
The potential difference between
the plates, 'Delta V',

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,270
is the integral 'E dot dl'.

27
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,445
Well when you go from here to
here, 'E' and 'dl' will be in

28
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:00,640
the same directions.

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,680
So you've got a plus sign there
for the cosine of the

30
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,720
angle 'theta'.

31
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,290
The integral of 'dl' is simply
the separation 'd', so you get

32
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:12,120
that the potential difference
is that value 'E' that you

33
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,560
already calculated
here times 'd'.

34
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,640
And so that becomes 'Q'
divided by 'A',

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,950
'epsilon 0' times 'd'.

36
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:32,050
We define the capacitance of
two metal surfaces, spheres

37
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,820
and spheres or cylinders and
cylinders or planes parallel,

38
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:42,010
whatever, we define capacitance
as the charge of

39
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,560
one of them, assuming that the
charge on the other one is the

40
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,230
same, divided by the potential
difference between the two.

41
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:53,000
It is the ability to carry a
certain amount of charge for a

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,530
given potential difference.

43
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:57,760
If this number is large, it can
carry a lot of charge for

44
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,140
the same potential difference.

45
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,160
And after what we have just
done, you should be able to

46
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,140
show very easily that for
a plane capacitor, the

47
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,490
capacitance is 'A' times
'epsilon 0' divided by 'd'.

48
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:19,420
And the unit is in farads
in SI units.

49
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,650
It's linearly proportional
to the area.

50
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,700
The larger the area, the more
charge it can contain.

51
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,310
That is intuitive.

52
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,980
It's not so intuitive that is
inversely proportional to 'd'.

53
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,230
