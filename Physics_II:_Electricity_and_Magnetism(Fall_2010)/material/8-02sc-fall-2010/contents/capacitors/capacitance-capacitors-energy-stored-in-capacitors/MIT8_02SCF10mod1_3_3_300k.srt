1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,267

2
00:00:06,267 --> 00:00:11,900
This is number 3, 25-24.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,440
Again, a classic, because we're

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,860
dealing with plane geometry.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:22,460
We have a capacitor, two
capacitor plates, each area

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,180
'A', and they have a distance
between the plates,

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,840
which is 'd1' .

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,890
The thing that is given is 'U1'
, the total energy in the

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,550
system at this situation--

10
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:39,740
the 1 refers to this one.

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:45,240
Let me just write down again 'C'
equals 'Q' divided by 'V',

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,500
'U' equals '1/2 C 'V squared'',
and you've seen

13
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,070
this just right now--

14
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:58,100
it's also '1/2 Q V' and '1/2
'Q squared' divided by C'.

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:04,080
The question now is, what
happens when we decrease 'd1'

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,740
, when 'd1' becomes smaller?

17
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,700
We go from 'd1' to 'd2' , and
'd2' is smaller than 'd1' .

18
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,620
What happened with 'U'?

19
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,040
It is essential that you realize
as we squeeze this

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,040
together, there is no battery.

21
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,250
If there's no battery, there's
only one thing that cannot

22
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,932
change, and that is the charge
on the capacitor.

23
00:01:31,932 --> 00:01:38,080
There is no way that charge is
kept or captured, so to speak,

24
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,065
on the plates, so no
matter how you move

25
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:41,250
it, that cannot change.

26
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,460
But if the charge cannot change,
then the electric

27
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,790
field cannot change-- but the
electric field, remember, is

28
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,920
'sigma' divided by
'epsilon 0'.

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,470
In the absence of a battery, we
can already say that 'Q' on

30
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:59,220
each plate is a constant,
and 'E' between

31
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,950
the plates is a constant.

32
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,300
Since the potential difference
between the plates is the

33
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,360
electric field times
the distance 'd'--

34
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,995
it's the integral
of E dot 'dl'--

35
00:02:10,995 --> 00:02:13,630

36
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,410
it's immediately obvious that
if 'd' goes down, and if 'd'

37
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,110
remains the same, that
the potential

38
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,710
difference goes down.

39
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,200
You can easily calculate
how much that is.

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:35,400
'U2' , which is '1/2 Q V2' is
clearly lower than 'U1' ,

41
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:43,250
which is '1/2 Q V1' , because
'V2' is smaller than 'V1' ,

42
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,760
and the 'Q's are the same--

43
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,740
the 2 is smaller than that.

44
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,740

45
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,390
Now since 'U2' is smaller
than 'U1' --

46
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:03,380
the plates pull on each other,
because a system always wants

47
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,600
to go from high potential energy
to a lower potential

48
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,450
energy, and I can prove
that to you.

49
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,930
Here is a pen: I let it
go, and it falls.

50
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,440
This potential energy is higher
than a lower one, and

51
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,380
that's exactly the
same electricity.

52
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:25,200
If with a smaller distance the
total electric energy is

53
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,390
smaller, it means that the
system wants to become

54
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,250
smaller-- it means that 'd'
wants to become smaller.

55
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,020
It's immediately obvious why
'd' wants to be smaller,

56
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,240
because if you have the
capacitor, and if this side

57
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,600
were negative, and if this side
were positive, clearly

58
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,010
they attract each other--

59
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,960
they do want to go together,
and it makes all the

60
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,710
sense in the world.

61
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:55,620
If I, Walter Lewin,
increase 'd'--

62
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,600
so I now increase it--

63
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,512
then I have to do
positive work.

64
00:03:59,512 --> 00:04:02,040

65
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,570
That's immediately obvious that
they want to go together,

66
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,390
and I want to pull them apart.

67
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,000
If they want to go together, and
I want to pull them apart,

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,640
I have to do positive work: that
means when I move them

69
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,280
apart, it's clear since I have
to do positive work, that's

70
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,620
the total potential energy,
electric energy in this case,

71
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,770
will increase.

72
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,870
I hope that you get
the connection--

73
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,890
smaller distance, slower
electric potential energy,

74
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,550
larger distance larger potential
energy, assuming

75
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,840
that there's no battery
connected.

76
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:46,380
If I increase 'd', then 'U' will
go up, 'V' will go up--

77
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,740
potential difference--

78
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,120
and the capacitance will go
down, because the capacitance

79
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,340
is inversely proportional to
'd', so if 'd' goes up, 'C'

80
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:59,770
will go down.

81
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,940
Now the situation changes
dramatically, because I'm

82
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,910
going to attach a battery--

83
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:12,290
when I attach the battery,
'Q' is not fixed anymore.

84
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,410
The only thing that is now
fixed is the potential

85
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:23,450
difference, so it's a very
different situation: 'Q' is

86
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:28,380
not fixed with the battery,
but now 'V' is fixed.

87
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,840
The potential difference
between the

88
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,860
plate cannot change.

89
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:41,070
Since 'U' equals '1/2 C 'V
squared'', and 'C' is

90
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:46,140
proportional to '1 over d', it
is immediately obvious that if

91
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:51,530
'd' goes down, 'C' goes up
therefore and 'V' remains

92
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:57,660
constant, that now since 'C'
goes up, 'U' goes up.

93
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,330
With the smaller distance, 'U2'
is now larger than 'U2' ,

94
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,295
so the situation is
exactly reversed.

95
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:09,410

96
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:14,810
'U' is also '1/2 Q V'--

97
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:19,180
'U' goes up, and 'V'
remains the same.

98
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,730
We also learn that 'Q'
goes up: that means a

99
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,390
current must flow.

100
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,130
The battery, which is connected
as we bring them

101
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:33,620
closer together, and more charge
appears on the plate--

102
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,947
that charge must be
provided by a

103
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:38,750
current from the batteries.
