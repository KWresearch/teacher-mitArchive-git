00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,170
WALTER LEWIN: We go
to number six.

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,210
Again, a classic.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,640
Because it's a cylinder
in a cylinder.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,140
And that means you smell
Gauss's Law.

6
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,940

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,000
Both metallic surfaces.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,940
It has length 'l'.

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:32,370
The radius here is a, the
radius here is b.

10
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,840
That is '+q' charge.

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,030
Only on the outer surface of
this metal, but there is no

12
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,420
charge here.

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:44,410
At least that was the situation
when Professor

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,940
Becker gave me the problem.

15
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,890
He may change his mind between
now and when you see him.

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,880
But that's the case, that's
the situation

17
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,280
the way I saw it.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,860
Now clearly, as a result of this
'+q' charge, there will

19
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,580
be a '-q' charge induced on the
inside of this cylinder

20
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:05,250
and a '+q' induced on the
outside of that cylinder, but

21
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,260
the net charge on that
cylinder is 0.

22
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,820
And you're being asked now
what the E field is

23
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,910
everywhere in space.

24
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:20,250
Well, 'r' less than a inside
this metal, 'E' is 0.

25
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,760
That is easy.

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,540
'r' less than 'b' and larger
than 'a', which

27
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:30,420
means in this opening--

28
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,560
we've done that before,
I think you

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,350
should do that yourself--

30
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:47,300
we get 'E' equals 'q' divided
by '2 pi r l 'epsilon 0'' if

31
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,500
'r' is this distance.

32
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,880

33
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,650
And it is pointing outwards,
so I give it a 'r roof'.

34
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,190
We've seen this before in our
previous assignment when we

35
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,820
called 'q' divided
by 'l' as lambda.

36
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,300
So you may want to
revisit this.

37
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,270
It's a famous result
for a cylinder.

38
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,970
But now, since there is no net
charge on the outside, this is

39
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,600
also true for 'r'
larger than 'b'.

40
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,260
Because if you make yourself
a Gaussian cylinder with a

41
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,840
radius larger than 'b', then the
charge inside remains '+

42
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,300
q' because this '-q' and '+q'
here cancel each other out.

43
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,990
There is no net charge, so you
find exactly the same answer.

44
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,410
What is now the potential
difference between this point

45
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,600
and this point between
the two cylinders?

46
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,610
And I will just write that
down-- shorthand notation--

47
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:58,770
as 'Va' minus 'Vb', which is the
integral in going from 'r'

48
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:08,950
equals 'a' to 'r' equals 'b' of
'E' in the cavity dot 'dr'.

49
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:16,530
That equals 'q' divided by '2
pi l 'epsilon 0'' times the

50
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:22,900
integral going from 'a'
to 'b', 'r roof' dot

51
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,820
'dr' divided by 'r'.

52
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,250
Remember, the field pulse is
'1 over r' because we're

53
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,520
dealing with cylinders.

54
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,960
This here, this dot product, is
scalar, which is the same

55
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:43,680
as 'dr' and this integral equals
the logarithm of 'b'

56
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,610
divided by 'a'.

57
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:49,740
And so since this is positive,
since 'b' is larger than 'a',

58
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,790
you see that 'a' has a larger
potential than 'b'.

59
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,350

60
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:01,590
if you want to know what the
capacitance is of the cable,

61
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,140
well, then I have to scratch
my beard a little bit.

62
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,150
Well, I don't have one.

63
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,290
Because whenever I have to
calculate capacitors, I've

64
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,840
always been taught to put the
same positive charge on one

65
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,560
metal surface, and the same
negative charge on the other.

66
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,530
Then calculate the E fields,
calculate the potential

67
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,270
difference, and then simply
say, 'C' equals

68
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,950
'Q' divided by 'V'.

69
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,960
But they don't have the same.

70
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,530
There's no positive charge
here and the

71
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,770
same negative charge.

72
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:40,960
So let me, for now, for the sake
of the argument, put '-q'

73
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,460
charge on the insides of the
cylinder and forget the '+q'

74
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,500
on the outside.

75
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,045
So this outer cylinder
is now charged with

76
00:04:50,045 --> 00:04:51,640
a net charge '-q'.

77
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,790

78
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:59,500
Since, because of induction,
all the charge goes on the

79
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,150
insides, the location that
I had is still correct.

80
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,240
But there's no '+q'
on the outside.

81
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,270
What now is the electric
field in this cavity?

82
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,520
It hasn't changed.

83
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,700
It's exactly the same
that it was before.

84
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,870
It's this.

85
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,290
So what is the potential
difference over this gap?

86
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,880
It's exactly the same
that it was before.

87
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,500
It hasn't changed.

88
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,200
In other words, the capacitance
'C' equals that

89
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,700
charge 'q' that I have here
divided by the potential

90
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,910
difference that I calculated,
which is the 'Va' minus 'Vb',

91
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,710
and that we calculated here.

92
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,140
You could read it here.

93
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,210
And so it's done.

94
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,460
And notice, by the way, that it
is proportional with 'l',

95
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,920
as it should be, because
clearly, the larger, the

96
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,940
longer the cylinder is, you
expect intuitively that the

97
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,150
larger the capacitance is.

98
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,000
But I hope you understand
the subtleness of why

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,510
I somehow, to be--

100
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,420
maybe I was too much
of a purist--

101
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,540
but to be absolutely on the
safe side, why I gave the

102
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:13,250
outer cylinder a '-q' charge
instead off it making neutral.

103
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,170
And that the '-q' charge
all goes to the

104
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,290
insides, well, so be it.

105
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,165
And that it turns out now that
I find it the same answer for

106
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:25,100
the electric field in the cavity
and therefore the same

107
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,500
answer for the potential
difference between 'a' and

108
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,810
'b', well, maybe I
was just lucky.

109
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,560
I don't know.

110
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,830
But I still think I did
it the safest way.

111
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,800
OK.

112
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,740
Now we fill the capacitor
with oil.

113
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,620
And the dialectric
constant is 2.2.

114
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:56,420
And we do that in the area where
there was vacuum before.

115
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,810
Now, 'E' remains 0 for
'r' less than 'a'.

116
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,870
That's not going to change.

117
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:07,210
The new 'E' in going to be the
old 'E', which we calculated,

118
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,320
divided by 'K'.

119
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,130
Remember, 'E' goes down.

120
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,630
That is for 'r' between
'b' and 'a'.

121
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:24,060
But for larger than 'b', now
the old 'E' does not change

122
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,240
because there is dialectric
outside the cylinder.

123
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,720
So now, the old 'E' that we
calculated, which falls off as

124
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,340
one of our remains.

125
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,210
So the only 'E' that changes,
that goes down by a factor of

126
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:44,390
'K', it in between
the two shells.

127
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:50,680
The induced charge, or maybe
the induced charge density,

128
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,980
which you want on the
dialectric, well, I would say

129
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,000
you do that.

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,720
And you may want to go back to
somewhere earlier in the

131
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,650
assignment where I did
that for you on

132
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,490
the parallel plates.

133
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,360
I don't think you are going to
find this so different .

134
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,890
So no we have, what happens with
'Va' minus 'Vb' when the

135
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:17,960
oil is in place?

136
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:24,300
Well, with the oil in place the
E field in that gap goes

137
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,020
down by a factor, 'K'.

138
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,210
And since the potential
difference is simply 'E' times

139
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:36,100
'd', and since 'd' is not
changing, the potential

140
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,920
difference goes down
by that factor 'K'.

141
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:46,420
And therefore, 'C' goes
up by that factor 'K'.

142
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,270
Think about that.

143
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,610
'C' equals 'q' divided by 'V'.

144
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,360
If 'V' goes down by a factor
of 'K', 'C' goes up by a

145
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,170
factor of 'K'.

146
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:02,510
Now comes a very
cute question.

147
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,950
Let's first assumed that
the cavity is open.

148
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:11,170
And now I, Walter Lewin,
bring in this oil.

149
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:14,660
And the question now is, when I
bring in this oil, will this

150
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:19,190
oil be sucked into this opening
or will this oil be

151
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,070
pushed out?

152
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,480
That means, do I have to do
work to keep it in there?

153
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,940
Well, it's a very
good question.

154
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,950
The way I would deal with it
is to calculate the total

155
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,450
electric energy in the case that
the oil is in there and

156
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,280
that the oil is not in there.

157
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,450
So now, let's write
down what 'U' is.

158
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,370
'U' equals '1/2 C V squared'.

159
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,320
Of course, you could always
use '1/2 QV' if

160
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,700
you like that better.

161
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,500
Or if you want to, you can write
down '1/2 Q squared'

162
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,695
divided by 'C'.

163
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:56,840
It doesn't matter which
one you pick.

164
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,660
I prefer to pick this one.

165
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:05,190
'Q' is now changing and since
the capacitance went up when I

166
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,890
bring in the oil by a factor
Kappa, it is clear that 'U'

167
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,750
goes down by a factor, Kappa.

168
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,950
Or, I call it 'K'.

169
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:13,420
Whatever.

170
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,610
So what does that mean?

171
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,390
Again, when I bring
in the oil, the

172
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,550
potential energy goes down.

173
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,290
It's like potential falling.

174
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,160
The system likes to do that.

175
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,980
Nature wants to go from high
potential energy to low

176
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,160
potential energy?

177
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,480
So what does that mean when
I bring in the oil?

178
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,020
That the oil is being suck in.

179
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,740
That's what it means.
