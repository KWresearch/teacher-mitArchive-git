1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,360
PROFESSOR: And now we're going
to problem number four.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,790
Now we have a capacitor
with a dialectric.

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,650
And that is always a
little bit harder.

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,400
Here is the capacitor.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,440
The area is 1 square meter.

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,940
It has a distance 'd' between
the plates, and what we are

8
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:37,850
being told is that the net 'E'
field in the capacitor is 1.4

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,840
times '10 to the 6' 'newtons
per coulombs' or 'volts per

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,960
meter', which ever you prefer.

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,890
And there is here a dialectric
inside with a dialectric

12
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,200
constant of 4 and 1/2.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,310
We're being asked what the free
surface charges density

14
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,960
is on the plate, that we call
that for definition free, and

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,310
what induced surface charge
densities on the dialectric.

16
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,020
And for that I'm going to make
an enlarged picture.

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:14,910
Here, the top plate, I make,
artificially, a gap, but the

18
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,230
gap is not there.

19
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,240
Here is the dialectric, and
again, I make here,

20
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,920
artificially, a gap.

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,810
Let's assume that the top plate
is positively charged,

22
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:32,700
then there will be free charge
here on this plate.

23
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,220
Let's call it 'sigma free'.

24
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,500
And there will be an equal
amount of negative charge.

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,270
Again, 'sigma free'.

26
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,140
In the absence of a dialectric
there would

27
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,550
be an electric field.

28
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,500
I call that the 'E free'.

29
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,010

30
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:59,360
And that free field is
easily calculable.

31
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,930
That would be 'sigma free'
divided by 'epsilon 0'.

32
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,110
In the absence of
this dialectric.

33
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,120
However, the dialectric is going
to be charged, itself.

34
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,500
We get negative induced
charge here.

35
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,560
I call it 'sigma-induced'.

36
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,400
It has the opposite sign, and
we got positive induced

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,680
charge, here.

38
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,460
'Sigma- induced' positive.

39
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,360
And this positive and this
negative charge will produce

40
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,380
an electric field--

41
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:38,040
I call it 'E-incuded'-- and do
which is opposing the electric

42
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,860
field without the dialectric.

43
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,590
And what you have in here is,
of course, the net electric

44
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:51,690
field, 'E net', which is the
vectorial sum of 'E free' plus

45
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,940
'E-induced'.

46
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,730

47
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,860
All right.

48
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:06,460
Let's now apply Gauss's Law to
a little bill box like so.

49
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,620
Within an area 'E' here, the
electric field outside the

50
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,770
plane capacitor equals 0.

51
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,010
Inside here I have an
electric field,

52
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,710
which is this net field.

53
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,000
It's pointing perpendicular
to the surface.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,480
There's is no flux leaking
out through the sides.

55
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,340
And I want to write down,
now, Gauss's Law in

56
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,730
two different ways.

57
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:40,870
First, I'm going to say that 'E
net' times that area 'A' is

58
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,760
the total charge inside that
box divided by 'epsilon 0'.

59
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,020
What is the total charge
inside that box?

60
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,790
That is, 'sigma free' minus
'sigma-induced'--

61
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,170
the minus sign because the
induced charge here is

62
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,640
negative, and I assume
that this metal

63
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,040
plate here is positive--

64
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,450
times 'A'--

65
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,210
this is the total charge
inside my pill box--

66
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,810
divided by 'epsilon 0'.

67
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,560
But--

68
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,870
and this is the definition
for dialectric--

69
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,500
it is also equal to 'sigma free'
times 'A' divided by

70
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,500
that dialectric constant
'K' 'epsilon 0'.

71
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,610
This is all the same.

72
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,420
And if you never want to bother
with induced charges,

73
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,930
you can just forget about this
and immediately write

74
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,190
down the 'K', here.

75
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,380
And what you see, here, that the
effect of the dialectric

76
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,420
is, if the dialectric constant
is 4.5 , that the 'E' field,

77
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,960
because of the dialectric, is
4.5 times the smaller that

78
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,130
what it would have been if the
dialectric hadn't been there.

79
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,230
You can just see this.

80
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,930
If a dialectric hadn't been
there, this would have been

81
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,970
the answer.

82
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,180
That would've been
the 'E free'--

83
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,430
that's this field.

84
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,450

85
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:05,950
But since the dialectric is
there, that's not the case.

86
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,765
Now, we lose the 'A's.

87
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:12,710

88
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,000
And now it's a little
bit up to you.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,810
Let us combine first this
one with this one.

90
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:27,420
I have one equation with
'sigma free' as--

91
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,770

92
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,240
no, no, no.

93
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,970
I'm going to do it slightly
differently.

94
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,930
I first take this.

95
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:42,390
And gives me one equation with
'sigma free' as unknown.

96
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,950
So you solve immediately
for 'sigma free'.

97
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,660
Now I take this equation, but
I know 'sigma free', and so

98
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:56,000
this equation now is, again,
one equation with

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,300
'sigma-induced' as unknown.

100
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,920
So now you can solve for
'sigma-induced'.

101
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,470
If you want to combine them in
a clever way, if you like

102
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:09,740
that, it's easy to prove that
'sigma free' equals '1 minus

103
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:15,770
'1 over 'K''' times
'sigma-induced'.

104
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,330
Don't try to remember that, but
that's what will follow

105
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,300
from these results.

106
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,050
So due to the dialectric the net
electric field is reduced.

107
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:31,340
And so if I summarize the
situation, the 'E' field--

108
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,110
this is my short
hand notation--

109
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,550
because of the dialectric is 4.5
times lower than what it

110
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,380
would have been if the
dialectric hadn't been here.

111
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,740
Therefore, the potential
difference over the plates is

112
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,410
4.5 times lower.

113
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,290
Because remember, the potential
difference is simply

114
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:52,850
'E' times 'd', and 'd'
is not changing.

115
00:06:52,850 --> 00:07:00,920
'C' equals 'Q free' divided by
the potential difference.

116
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,720
'Q free' is not changing, the
potential difference goes

117
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:12,830
down, and so the capacitance
goes up by a factor 'K'.

118
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:18,400
So with the dialectric, the
capacitance has a 4.5 times

119
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,900
larger capacitance.

120
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:30,550
The little 'u', which is energy
density, how many

121
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,430
joules per cubic meter equals
1/2 times the dialectric

122
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:39,110
constant times 'epsilon
0' times 'E squared'?

123
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,070
This would be in joules
per cubic meter.

124
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,790

125
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:47,510
It's easy to calculate
how much this is.

126
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,120
I found it to be 39.0.

127
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,790
Because I think you know 'E',
you know 'K', so that is

128
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,960
rather easy.

129
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,180
Since you know, if you want to
know the total 'U', you have

130
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,990
to take the little 'u' times
the volume, and that is the

131
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,070
little 'u' times the area 'A'
times the separation 'd'.

132
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,670
This was 1 meter.

133
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:15,420
You are given 'd', so you can
calculate what the total

134
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,990
electric energy is
in this system.
