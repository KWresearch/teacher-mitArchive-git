1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,630
PROFESSOR: OK then, so now I'm
doing turning to problem

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:16,200
number eight, which is the last
one for which I need a

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,200
lot of time.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,200
It's a difficult one.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,430
It is the one that
is a mathematical

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,060
headache, let's face it.

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,030
And personally, I don't care
for that problem too much.

9
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,340
An electric dipole.

10
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,308
Let's try to make
a nice diagram.

11
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:35,760
x, y, z.

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,590

13
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,350
We have at location
a on the x-axis--

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:47,070
as location, I call that point
B. We have a charge + q.

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,290
On the other side, a from the
origin on the a-axis, and I

16
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,690
call that point capital A. We
have - q and you're being

17
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,770
asked now to calculate the
e-field everywhere in space.

18
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,990
Let us choose this point in
space, which has as a location

19
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,810
x, y, and z.

20
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,980
And let's try to make a
three-dimensional plot.

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,690

22
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:24,910
So this is the x position of
that point P, this is the z

23
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:33,130
position of that point
P. I hope that I can

24
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,431
draw straight lines.

25
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:38,710
It's not so bad.

26
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:47,590
And this is the y position of
that point P. I hope you can

27
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,350
see this as a box.

28
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:55,200
And at the corner of the box
here is that point P. And the

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,720
vector from the origin to point
P is this vector, and I

30
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,320
call that vector r.

31
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,340
And it is immediately obvious
that r, the magnitude of r,

32
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,440
equals the square root
of x squared plus y

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,510
squared plus z squared.

34
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,310
Now I'm going to first calculate
the electric field

35
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,540
at P only due to point B. And
then later we're going to add

36
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,370
the electric field
due to point A.

37
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:36,810
I'm going to shift the entire
coordinate system to point B.

38
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,800
So I'm going to make a new
coordinate system.

39
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,250

40
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:50,260
I call this y prime, I called
this x prime, and

41
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,080
I call this z prime.

42
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,100
This point is now not o, but
this point is now point B

43
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:06,510
where the + q charge is and here
is now that point P. The

44
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:15,440
distance between B and
P is now this vector.

45
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,690
I call this angle theta.

46
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,870

47
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,320
And I will try to make a
projection again, so that you

48
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,570
can see things.

49
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,930

50
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,570
This is the x prime position,
this is the z prime position.

51
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,440

52
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,230
Let's call these angle phi.

53
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:46,260
And so this is the y prime
position of P.

54
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,660
If this angle is theta, then of
course, this angle here is

55
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,670
also theta.

56
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:59,450
I want you to appreciate that
x prime is x minus a because

57
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,920
we have moved up the origin
only in the x-direction.

58
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,210
But that y prime is the same
as y and that z prime

59
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,110
is the same as z.

60
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,670
That has not changed.

61
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:14,770
So for point P, the x prime
position is x minus a, the y

62
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,580
position is the same as y prime,
and the z position is

63
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,410
the same as z prime.

64
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,380
What is the distance BP?

65
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:32,360
Well BP is the square root
now of x prime squared.

66
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,290
For which I can write down
x minus a squared.

67
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,160
Plus I can write down y prime
squared, but I might as well

68
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,780
write down y squared plus
z prime squared.

69
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,340
For which I might as well
write z squared.

70
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:57,320
What is the electric field, E,
at location P only due to this

71
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,630
+ q charge at position B?

72
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:08,000
We know that it is along the
line BP pointing outwards in

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,810
the direction BP.

74
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,860
So I will try to
put it in here.

75
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:19,020
I will call it E of P. It's in
the same direction as BP.

76
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:28,830
The magnitude of it equals q
divided by 4 pi epsilon 0

77
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,370
times BP squared.

78
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,600
Namely, the radius squared.

79
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,310
And it is pointing outwards
because this q is positive.

80
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,930
Now I want to know what the
x-component, the y-component,

81
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,830
and the z-component
is of this vector.

82
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,180
And now I need the help of these
angles theta, and these

83
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,660
angles phi.

84
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,540
It's now becoming a mathematical
problem.

85
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,950
No more physics.

86
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:04,470
E of x, as you can confirm for
yourself, is the magnitude of

87
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:11,530
EP times the sine of theta
times the cosine of phi.

88
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:18,860
E of y equals E of P times
the cosine of theta.

89
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,490
That's very easy to see.

90
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,550
Once you know what the magnitude
EP is, if you want

91
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,490
to know the projection in this
direction, then all you have

92
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,840
to do is multiply by the
cosine of theta.

93
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:40,270
And E of z equals EP times
the sine of theta

94
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,665
times the sine of phi.

95
00:06:42,665 --> 00:06:51,040

96
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,190
Maybe I should have said
here, x prime.

97
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,495
The component in the
x prime direction.

98
00:06:57,495 --> 00:07:00,200

99
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,900
Now, what is cosine theta?

100
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,550

101
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,620
By the way, the x prime
direction of course, is also

102
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,510
the direction of x.

103
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,100
So it's really absurd
to call it x prime.

104
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,200
It is the component of
E in the x direction.

105
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,240
So forget the prime.

106
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:23,770
Cosine theta equals y
prime divided by BP.

107
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,670
Convince yourself of that.

108
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,496
The sine of theta equals--

109
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:32,460

110
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:40,820
now I need this length for
the sine of theta.

111
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:46,450
And this length here equals
the square root of x prime

112
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:51,240
squared plus z prime squared.

113
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,310
And so the sine of theta equals
the square of x prime

114
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:04,140
squared plus z prime squared
divided by BP.

115
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:10,710
The cosine of phi equals x prime
divided by that same

116
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:19,510
square root, and the sine
of phi equals z prime.

117
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,200
Again, divided by that
same square root.

118
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,990
And I really think you should
check that very carefully.

119
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:32,150
And when I substitute these
cosines and sines in here, I

120
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,820
find a very simple answer.

121
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:45,240
I find that E of x equals this q
divided by 4 pi epsilon 0 BP

122
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:52,260
squared times x prime
divided by BP.

123
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,752
But remember, x prime
equals x minus a.

124
00:08:57,752 --> 00:09:01,170
x prime equals x minus a.

125
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:09,090
I find for E of y, the
same thing times y

126
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,530
prime divided by BP.

127
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:16,630
But remember, y prime = y.

128
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:23,730
And I find for E of z, the
same things times z prime

129
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,580
divided by BP.

130
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,670
But remember, z prime = z.

131
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:36,360
And so, for this one charge at
location B, for that one

132
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:44,050
alone, I find q divided
by 4 pi epsilon 0.

133
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:53,710
And now I'm going to get here
all the rest. I get here x

134
00:09:53,710 --> 00:10:01,290
minus a unit vector in the x
direction plus y unit vector

135
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,830
in the y direction plus
z times the unit

136
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,590
vector in the k direction.

137
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:17,350
And downstairs I get x minus a
squared plus y squared plus z

138
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,960
squared to the power 3/2.

139
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,320
That now is the complete
contribution only from the

140
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,060
charge at point B.

141
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:33,600
You now have to add the part
from point A. So you get a - q

142
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,970
divided by 4 pi epsilon 0.

143
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,310
And you get exactly the same
thing here, except that

144
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:45,450
wherever you had a -
a, you now get a +

145
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:50,270
a for obvious reasons.

146
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:52,790
You have to add the two up and
you'll see immediately the

147
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:58,860
answer that you were
given in your book.

148
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:05,720
Now they want you to simplify
this in the case that r is

149
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,830
much larger than a.

150
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,610
And this begins again, to be
mathematical manipulation.

151
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,870
And we're using Taylor's
expansion.

152
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:22,986
Keep in mind that this
vector is almost r.

153
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:29,860
It's almost the vector r because
the vector r equals x

154
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:36,100
times this plus y times this
plus z times the unit vector

155
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,110
in the z direction.

156
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,390
Except for this one here.

157
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,080
So I'm going to rewrite this
and I forget now this term.

158
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,760
Just forget that.

159
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,940
I'm only interested
in the geometry.

160
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:53,690
So I get r minus ai to
account for this.

161
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:58,640
And downstairs you can convince
yourself that this is

162
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:03,530
very close to r squared
to the power 3/2.

163
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,720
But not quite because you
have this term here.

164
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,100
And so if I work that out, I get
r squared minus 2ax to the

165
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,165
power of 3/2.

166
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:16,060
Have I cheated?

167
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,170
Yes, I have cheated
a little bit.

168
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,930
I have ignored a squared.

169
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,320
Because notice, when
you square this,

170
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,570
you get an a squared.

171
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,900
But since r is much, much
larger than a, I feel

172
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,660
completely justified
doing that.

173
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,900
But I'm going one step
further now.

174
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,210
By the way, I only take
this first term.

175
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,630
Second term you work
out yourself.

176
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,580
I'm going one step further.

177
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:43,240
And I'm going to use something
that, perhaps you remember

178
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,500
from last year.

179
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,400
That if x equals much, much
less than 1, that this

180
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:54,890
quantity is approximately
1 plus n times x.

181
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,540
And so I'm going to take
the r squared out of

182
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,840
the brackets here.

183
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,270
So I get r minus a
times the unit

184
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,290
vector in the x direction.

185
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,820
Then I get an r cubed here
because don't forget

186
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,710
there's this 3/2.

187
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:18,870
And I get 1 minus 2ax divided by
r squared to the power 3/2.

188
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:26,560
I know that this is much, much
smaller then 1 when r is much,

189
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,720
much larger than a.

190
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,510
And so, I can apply
the same Taylor

191
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,690
expansion that I have here.

192
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:42,870
And so this now becomes
r minus a i roof

193
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,140
divided by r cubed.

194
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:56,250
And then I have here
upstairs 1 plus 3ax

195
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,270
divided by r squared.

196
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,950
And this is now where my Taylor
expansion has come in.

197
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:08,000
You will now have to add the
term due to a, which is due to

198
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,380
the charge f point capital
A. Which is going to

199
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,380
be extremely similar.

200
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,740
Don't forget that the charge
was negative, so you put a

201
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,280
negative sign their first. And
then the signs of a will flip.

202
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:26,490
So this will become a plus and
this will become a minus.

203
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,300
What you do then is you're
going to add

204
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,090
those two terms up.

205
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:36,250
So this is the geometry term
only due to capital B. You add

206
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,470
to it the geometry term
only due to capital

207
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,430
A, to the - q charge.

208
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:46,360
And a lot of terms when you
work this out will vanish.

209
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,870
But they will not all vanish,
and so you'll find then that

210
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:58,820
the final E vector for the case
that r equals much, much

211
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:04,750
larger than a, you will find
that that is approximately q

212
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:11,660
times 2a divided by 4 pi
epsilon 0 r cubed.

213
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:19,560
And then here, you will get 3 r
vector times x divided by r

214
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,600
squared minus the unit vector
in the x direction.

215
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,800
That is the final result.

216
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,190
The result can be slightly
simplified if you want to.

217
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:37,650
And you are being asked
to simplify it.

218
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:42,750
You are being asked to somehow
manipulate this number to

219
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:47,890
convert it into a dot product.

220
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:52,200
If we leave this alone and you
are willing to spend the time,

221
00:15:52,200 --> 00:16:00,220
you can prove that the term here
can also be written as 3

222
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,260
times r roof.

223
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,000
That means the unit vector
in the r direction.

224
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,360
Dotted with the unit vector
in the x direction.

225
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,370
This is a dot product.

226
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:15,456
Times the unit vector in the
r direction minus i.

227
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:18,600
And it took me a few minutes to
convince me that this and

228
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,180
this is the same.

229
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,590
And this whole term then,
of course, appears here.

230
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:29,520
And so what you see is that both
this term and this term

231
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,800
fall off as 1 over r cubed.

232
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,850
That may not be so obvious from
this, but it is obvious

233
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,930
once you have massaged
it in this form.

234
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,920
It's proportional to
1 over r cubed.

235
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,780
And that now is very
characteristic for a dipole.

236
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,890
If it were a monopole, if I had
only one charge, we know

237
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:55,920
we have already done it today,
then the electric field falls

238
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,760
off as 1 over r squared.

239
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,540
But when you have the dipole,
the positive charge and the

240
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:08,280
negative charge, in a way,
try to cancel each other.

241
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,940
The positive charge at point B
is having an electric field

242
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:20,230
vector pointing away from point
P. From B to P. But the

243
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,990
negative charge at point A is
introducing an E vector, which

244
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,780
is going towards point A. And
so in a way, they are almost

245
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,160
trying to cancel each other.

246
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,110
But not quite.

247
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,920
And that's why the dependence
becomes 1 over r cubed.

248
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:43,440
So it's much more sensitive
to how far you are away.

249
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,740
It falls off much faster.

250
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:50,230
When you're very, very far away,
you can sort of see that

251
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:57,940
the vector due to B, E due to
that point B. And that the

252
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,080
vector due to point A are
beginning to almost cancel

253
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,540
each other.

254
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,800
Because it's very,
very far away.

255
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,860
The fact that A and B are not
exactly at the same location

256
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,850
almost doesn't matter anymore.

257
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:21,570
All right, I will also want to
show you why this is minus

258
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,080
unit vector in the
x direction.

259
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,870
If we put a charge either on the
y-axis or on the z-axis,

260
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:33,420
then this term equals 0.

261
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:37,430
Convince yourself that both on
the y- and the z-axis, the dot

262
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,700
product between the unit vector
in the r and the unit

263
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,880
vector in the x direction
must be 0.

264
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,900
Because y direction and
z direction are

265
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,830
perpendicular to x.

266
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,920
So it's going to be 0.

267
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,270
Another way of putting it is
when x equals 0, you can also

268
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,850
see here that this term is 0.

269
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:58,850
So you only end up
with this term.

270
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,850
So let's take that situation
that we have now here the

271
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,460
x-axis, here the y-axis, and
that we have here a charge + q

272
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:12,770
at location B, and here a - q
at location A. Then we know

273
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,770
that the electric field
lines run like so.

274
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:20,530

275
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:26,880
And no matter where you are on
the y-axis, that means as x

276
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,140
equals 0, there will always be
an e vector pointing in the

277
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,570
minus x direction.

278
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,950
Always.

279
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:43,650
And that is exactly what you see
here if I have the right--

280
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,670
oh, sorry.

281
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,450
Sorry, my sheet fell all
the way on the floor.

282
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,190
But it was in the minus
i direction in the

283
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,980
unit vector x direction.

284
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,580
That's exactly what you see.

285
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,900
It's very easy to imagine.

286
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,000
OK, we've come to the end.

287
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,120
I have a minute and half left.

288
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,370
I will watch the tape to correct
possible slips of the

289
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,385
tongue and slips of the pen.

290
00:20:08,385 --> 00:20:09,970
There are always some.

291
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,140
But I have enough time to
correct them, I hope.

292
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,480
So don't go away yet.

293
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,190
Over, but not yet out.

294
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,110

295
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,430
Well I watched my tape.

296
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,240
It must have been one
of my good days.

297
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,080
I only found two minor
slips of the tongue.

298
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,340
And I bet you, you
both caught them.

299
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,150
I mentioned here with
oxygen 8 protons I

300
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,690
said with two electrons.

301
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,810
But I wrote down the 8 and that
of course, is correct.

302
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,590
Protons--

303
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:40,020
8 protons and 8 electrons.

304
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:44,140
And then at the dipole problem,
I said if you put a

305
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,360
charge on the y-
or the z-axis.

306
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,600
Of course, I didn't mean
putting a charge there.

307
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,480
The charge is always on the
x-axis, + a and - a.

308
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,740
What I meant is, if you measure
the electric field on

309
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,350
the y- and the z-axis.

310
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:02,660
And so, that's what I did
here in this drawing.

311
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,580
You are looking here at the
electric field are you will

312
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,830
see that then the electric
field is always

313
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,730
in the minus x direction.

314
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:10,938
