1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,610

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,230
And so now we come
to problem number

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,930
two, which is a classic.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,270
I want you to really pay
attention to it, and in any

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,640
case, you should be able
to do this problem

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,370
cold at the next exam.

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,390
Problem number two.

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:22,320
23, 28.

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,900
We have a conducting shell.

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,650

11
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,140
It's a metal.

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,690
This is the metal.

13
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:36,730
The inner core vacuum, radius
a, and the outer

14
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:39,750
shell has radius b.

15
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:45,480
And there is, right here at the
center, a point charge +

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,670
q, and here, at the outer
surface, is a

17
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,570
total charge of - 3q.

18
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,410
That total charge, undoubtedly,
is uniformly

19
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,220
distributed.

20
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,220
Whether you like it or not,
that happens automatically

21
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,110
when this is a metal.

22
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,830
All right now.

23
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:08,970
Now, you're being asked to
calculate what the electric

24
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,400
field is everywhere
here in space.

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,200
Here, here, and there.

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,500
Now, there's no charge inside
the conductor, because any

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,740
charge inside the conductor
would make me the electrons

28
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,000
experience a force.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,620
The electrons would to start to
flow, and they would kill

30
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,000
the electric field.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,010
So already for r less than b,
and larger than a in the

32
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:39,030
shell, we know that the electric
field equals 0.

33
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,450
So that's easy.

34
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:47,180
What, now, is the situation
for our larger than b?

35
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,240
I take a Gaussian sphere--

36
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,730
you have to always work
with symmetry.

37
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:56,460
So you bring this concentric
sphere here, and this

38
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,820
concentric sphere
has a radius r.

39
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,870
Let us assume, this could be
wrong, that the electric field

40
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,400
is pointing outwards.

41
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,060
It is certainly going
to be radial.

42
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,540
It has to be radial for reasons
of spherical symmetry.

43
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:21,620
And of course, the surface
elements ds will all be

44
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,310
everywhere perpendicular to the
surface, no matter where

45
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,440
you are on the sphere.

46
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,600
So what is Gauss's law?

47
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,270
Telling us now that to closed
surface integral of e is the

48
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:39,170
dot product with that ds, that
is the total charge inside the

49
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,590
sphere divided by epsilon 0.

50
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,880
Well, e is everywhere
the same in terms of

51
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,960
magnitude on this sphere.

52
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,620
And so the dot products we will
take plus 1, because we

53
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,765
will make the assumption
that they

54
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:54,180
are in the same direction.

55
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,920
If the assumption is wrong,
we will quickly find out.

56
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,820
So I find 4 pi r squared
times e equals the

57
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,420
total charge inside.

58
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:10,390
This is - 3q plus q is
- 2q divided by 4

59
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,970
pi epsilon 0 r squared--

60
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:22,680
no, 2q, I'm getting
ahead of myself.

61
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,570
Epsilon 0.

62
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,710
Total charge inside divided
by epsilon 0.

63
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:31,630
And so what do I find for
the electric field?

64
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:41,500
The electric field then becomes
- 2q divided by 4 pi

65
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,805
epsilon 0 r squared.

66
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:46,700
And if you really want to get
the direction right, this

67
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,680
minus sign means that my
assumption was wrong, so it's

68
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,840
pointing inwards.

69
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,090
So you can put an R roof here.

70
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,110
It means, you know, this minus
is winning over the plus, so

71
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,520
the electric field is
pointing inwards.

72
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,510

73
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:10,450
If now you want to know what the
electric field is inside

74
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:17,240
the inner cavity, then
again, you apply--

75
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,730
here is that radius a.

76
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:28,310
You again apply a spherical
surface, with radius little r,

77
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,730
and you yourself can very easily
convince yourself that

78
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:38,570
inside this cavity, the electric
field will now be + q

79
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:44,660
divided by 4 pi r squared
epsilon 0 R roof.

80
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,202
Or the e field is now not
pointing inwards, but the e

81
00:04:49,202 --> 00:04:54,140
field is here in this cavity,
pointing outwards.

82
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,810
And notice that when r equals
0, right here, you get and

83
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,990
infinite value, which of course

84
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:03,810
physically has no meaning.

85
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:07,390
I would like to make a drawing,
which is very useful,

86
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,680
I think, of the electric
field.

87
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,020
I don't think you're being asked
to do this, but it's

88
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,216
always very useful.

89
00:05:14,216 --> 00:05:18,700
The electric field as a function
of distance r from

90
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,180
the center.

91
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,620
Here is location b, and
here is location a.

92
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:30,060
So we know that right here, we
have a magnetic field which is

93
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:36,640
- 2 q divided by
4 pi epsilon 0.

94
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,680
r squared becomes now b squared,
because I'm at the

95
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,640
location b, and then it falls
off to 0 proportional to 1

96
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,210
over r squared.

97
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:54,990
Then inside the shell, inside
the metal, there cannot be any

98
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,270
e field, so it drops to 0.

99
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,400
There's a discontinuity here.

100
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:07,050
And then inside the cavity, it
increases as 1 over r squared,

101
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,210
and it goes here too.

102
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,680
Infinity for r equals 0.

103
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,770

104
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,900
Now we are being asked about
the induction charges.

105
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:29,120
If I have here the inner cavity,
radius a and charge +

106
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,480
q here, then I know that the
electric field anywhere here

107
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,540
in the metal is 0.

108
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,640
So if I take some Gaussian
surface r prime, which is

109
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:48,770
slightly larger than a, and I
apply Gauss's law, then I find

110
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:56,490
that 4 pi r prime squared
times e must be 0.

111
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,760
Because e is 0, and therefore
it follows that q

112
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,040
inside must be 0.

113
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,860
But how can q inside be 0,
because there is a + q here?

114
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,770
Well, the only way that nature
can do it, that nature

115
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,130
enduces, now, on of the inside
of the inner sphere a total

116
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:17,890
charge of - q, so that
the net charge inside

117
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,980
this sphere is 0.

118
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,400
And similarly, you can calculate
the induced charge

119
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,590
on the outer shell.

120
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,790
I'd like you to do that, to be
consistent with the electric

121
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,360
field that we just calculated.

122
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,160
It's a very important problem.

123
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,120
You have to fully
understand this.

124
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,740
And as I said, make sure for
next exam that you can do this

125
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,020
blindfolded at 3 AM in
the morning if I

126
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,270
were to wake you up.

127
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,330
Very well.

128
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:51,220
Now we want to know the electric
potential everywhere.

129
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,950
How is electric potential
defined?

130
00:07:53,950 --> 00:08:00,700
Va potential at a minus the
potential at b is the integral

131
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:06,960
going from a to b of the
electric field's vector dot dl

132
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,570
over some pass length l So
here is point a, and

133
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:15,140
here is point b.

134
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,050
Here is some crazy routing.

135
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:21,810
Here is a little factor dl.

136
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,250
And at that particular location,
the e vector is like

137
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,990
so, and everywhere along the
path do I have to calculate

138
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,580
that dot product, e dot el, and
I have to integrate that

139
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,770
over the whole path.

140
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,810
That is the definition.

141
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:41,980
Very often do you see in books
that it is minus the integral

142
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:47,960
in going from b to a of e dot
dl, and that, of course, is

143
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,670
exactly the same thing.

144
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:55,610
We often, when we can, define
the electric potential at

145
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:58,110
infinity 0.

146
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,160
It's not always possible, as
you will see in the future,

147
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,720
but whenever we can,
we do that.

148
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,780
It's just convenient.

149
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,410
With gravity, we have a similar
situation, that

150
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,540
gravitational potential, it
didn't matter what you call 0.

151
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,410
Whether you call the ground
floor 0, or the surface of the

152
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,010
table 0, it doesn't matter.

153
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:22,310
And the reason is that it is
the difference in potential

154
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,420
that determines what the actual
physics will be doing,

155
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,210
and not the absolute value.

156
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:32,760

157
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:40,190
So if I go from point a in some
crazy way to point b, and

158
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:50,650
if the integral of e dot dl
along this path is independent

159
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:57,360
of how I'm going, then the
potential difference VA minus

160
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,100
VB, is uniquely determined.

161
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,220
And we call the electric
field, then, a

162
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,490
conservative field.

163
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,550
If, however, the potential
difference or I should really

164
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:14,240
say, if the integral e dot dl
depends on the routing , then

165
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,280
the electric field is
non-conservative.

166
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,400
And it's very hard to imagine
what that can be.

167
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,170
But you're going to see
this in the future,

168
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,790
with Faraday's law.

169
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,530
And almost no one has any
intuition for that.

170
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,590
And the whole concept of
potential difference is then

171
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:34,390
not even defined, because the
integral e dot dl from one

172
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:38,040
point to another depends
on the routing.

173
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,060
Gravitational fields are
conservative, because again

174
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,520
there, it doesn't matter how you
move from one point on the

175
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,990
table to a higher point.

176
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,180
But friction is
non-conservative, because if I

177
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,830
have here point a, and I have
here point b, and I move my

178
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,730
finger this way, I experience
a frictional force.

179
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,350
Well, if I go along a straight
line, the work that I have to

180
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,030
do to overcome that friction is
less than if I made these

181
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,280
enormous sidetrack.

182
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,020

183
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,450
So friction is a
non-conservative force.

184
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:22,640
If you multiply delta v,
electric potential, with a

185
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,320
charge q, then you get energy.

186
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,200
In a similar way, if you
multiply the gravitational

187
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,330
potential, which I will define
now as gh, if you multiply

188
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:39,910
that with a mass, then
you also get energy.

189
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:45,550
So you see, the electric charge
q in electricity plays

190
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,050
the same role as the
mass in gravity.

191
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,300
And one could call, then, this
the difference in electric

192
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,230
potential, and this,
the difference in

193
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,250
gravitational potential.

194
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:04,730
h is the vertical distance
between the two points that

195
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:07,850
you are considering.

196
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,040
Let's now go back
to our problem.

197
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:19,190
And we want to know what
va minus the vr.

198
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,240
We have the--

199
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,460
let me make sure that I have
the geometry right.

200
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:27,730
Yeah.

201
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:40,520
We have here the radius a, and
we have here + q, and we want

202
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,370
to know what va minus vr is,
and we want to know that

203
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,490
everywhere in space.

204
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:52,290
va minus vr, let's
call this r.

205
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,488
So what is the potential
difference between-- oh no,

206
00:12:55,488 --> 00:12:56,856
this is not what I meant.

207
00:12:56,856 --> 00:13:01,250
I meant this point to be a.

208
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,840
My shorthand notation is this
point a, potential difference

209
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,190
with this point r.

210
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:14,770
Well, this is a metal, so
there's no electric field.

211
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:18,560
So the potential difference
between the surface of the

212
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:25,130
inner cavity and any point
in the metal equals 0.

213
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:29,070
What, now, is the situation
when I am anywhere

214
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,130
between a and b?

215
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,210
Well, again, then e, then must
be 0, because it's 0

216
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,230
everywhere in the metal.

217
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,350
The metal is an equipotential
.

218
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:45,980
What now is the potential
difference between a point b,

219
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:53,730
say here, I call this point a,
at the surface b, and some

220
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:58,300
point p, which is at a distance
r from the center?

221
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,730
What now?

222
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,940
If va minus vp.

223
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:07,820
Well, the electric field
is pointing inwards.

224
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:12,040

225
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,190
We just calculated that.

226
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,920
It's a function of all r.

227
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,870
For what was 1 over r squared.

228
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,080
And so it should be immediately
obvious that va

229
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,820
must be less than vp.

230
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,280

231
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,670
If I take a plus charge and I
release the plus charge, the

232
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,020
plus charge will move
in this direction.

233
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,760
And the plus charge always moves
from a higher potential

234
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,710
to a lower potential.

235
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,210
That's something that you
really should remember.

236
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:46,310
When you're in doubt, you take a
plus charge, you release it,

237
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,610
it will move in a certain
direction, of

238
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,730
the electric force.

239
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,060
It always goes from higher

240
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,120
potential to a lower potential.

241
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,405
Whereas a negative charge, so
to speak, flows upstream.

242
00:14:57,405 --> 00:15:01,260
It goes from a lower potential
to a higher potential.

243
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:05,670
So you already see that va
must be lower than vp.

244
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,210
What is the difference between
here and here?

245
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,960
Well, there is a neat way to do
it, and there is some kind

246
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,530
of a dirty way to do it.

247
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:17,730
The dirty way would be to say
OK, I take the integral from a

248
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,260
to p of e dot dl.

249
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,960
I will call the l in this case
dr. And I don't worry about

250
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,990
minus signs.

251
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,280
I don't even worry about
this dot product.

252
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,870
Because the dot product
either produces a plus

253
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,530
one or a minus one.

254
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,180
I just do a very dirty
integration job without

255
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,770
worrying about signs.

256
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,680
And even that turns out that
va is not smaller than vp.

257
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,000
I just cheat and put a minus
sign in front of it, and I

258
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,370
think no one can blame
me for that.

259
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,560
Because I know in advance that
va must be smaller than vp.

260
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,290
Now, if you want to do it the
elegant way, the neat way,

261
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,080
which of course is
a little longer,

262
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,750
then it goes as follows.

263
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:06,092
So now we are larger than b.

264
00:16:06,092 --> 00:16:10,500
The electric field, I go now to
a complete vector notation,

265
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:18,280
equals minus 2q divided by 4 pi
epsilon 0 r squared R roof.

266
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:18,890
Would you agree?

267
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,360
It's pointing inwards,.

268
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,000
And of course I will write down,
for dl, I will write

269
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,450
down dr.

270
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:34,320
So the integral from point a to
point p of the e vector dot

271
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:43,210
dr can now be written as - 2q
divided by 4 pi epsilon 0

272
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:47,540
times the integral in going from
location r equals b, that

273
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,710
was that that point a, 2r equals
r, that was that point

274
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,670
p, and now notice carefully.

275
00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:00,655
r roof dot, I shouldn't forget
the dot, dr, which is also a

276
00:17:00,655 --> 00:17:04,650
vector, divided by r squared.

277
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:10,920
This is nothing but dr. It is
plus dr. I hope you can

278
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,920
convince yourself of that,
because r roof and dr are in

279
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,330
the same direction.

280
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:22,140
In other words, I will have to
only evaluate this integral dr

281
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,650
over r squared.

282
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:32,430
And that equals minus 1 over r
between b and r, and so that

283
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:38,070
equals 1 over b minus
1 over r.

284
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,770
And this value is positive.

285
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,780
Because b is smaller than r.

286
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,890
r was outside b.

287
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,720
And so this is the neat
way to do it.

288
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,150
The elegant way.

289
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:58,420
And so you'll find now that va
minus vp equals minus 2q

290
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:06,670
divided by 4 pi epsilon 0 times
1 over b minus 1 over r.

291
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,230
Potential has no direction.

292
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,000
It's a scalar.

293
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,370
We express it in terms of
volts in MKS units.

294
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:20,440
And when you go to infinity,
then r goes to infinity.

295
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,060
In this case, v goes to 0.

296
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:28,880
And so, if you want to know what
exactly the potential is

297
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,820
at that location a, which was at
that radius b, then you'll

298
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:41,150
find minus 2q divided by 4 pi
epsilon 0 times 1 over b.

299
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:46,205
This now is the potential
at the outer surface.

300
00:18:46,205 --> 00:18:49,050

301
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,890
I would also like to make a
drawing of the potential as a

302
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,740
function of r.

303
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,830
It always helps, it gives
you some insight.

304
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:03,110
So here is the potential v,
and here is the radius r.

305
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:09,250
I have here the outer shell b,
and here the inner shell a.

306
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:18,730
Well, the electric potential
here we know equals minus 2q

307
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,800
divided by 4 pi epsilon 0b.

308
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,050
We just calculated that.

309
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:31,540
And then it falls
off as 1 over r,

310
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,760
proportional to 1 over 4.

311
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,310
In the shell, there's
no electric field.

312
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,880
If there's no electric field, it
must be equal in potential.

313
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,240
So the potential is everywhere
the same, so it

314
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,490
remains this value.

315
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,510

316
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:54,530
And now you go inside the
sphere, and that's the part

317
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:57,470
where I think I want
you to show that.

318
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,965
Now the potential will
increase again.

319
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:03,350

320
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:06,650
And I'll bet you anything that
it will also increase as 1

321
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:11,830
over r, and it'll go to infinity
at r equals 0.

322
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:15,850
So I want you with a Gaussian
surface, to calculate what the

323
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,420
potential is for r.

324
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,650
It's less than a, and
r is larger than 0.

325
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,890
What you see here is something
interesting.

326
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:28,390
That there is one spot inside
the inner cavity where the

327
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:33,190
potential is 0.

328
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,900
And I would like you
to calculate

329
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,900
at what r that occurs.

330
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,120
I did it.

331
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,680
I may have made a mistake.

332
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:46,750
And I found when r equals ab
divided by 2a plus b that

333
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,940
right there, the potential
is again 0.

334
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,860
So if this is that inner cavity
which has radius a,

335
00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:00,410
then there is here somewhere a
radius where the potential

336
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,800
everywhere is 0.

337
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,200

338
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,570
All right.

339
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:11,470
Potential difference is
connected with work.

340
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:17,250
When I put a 1 coulomb charge in
my pocket, and I move from

341
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:22,710
one potential to another, then
if I go from a lower potential

342
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:28,290
to a higher potential, with the
1 coulomb in my pocket, I

343
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:32,920
walk uphill, I have to
do positive work.

344
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,840
If I go with the 1 coulomb in
my pocket from a higher

345
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,620
potential to a lower
