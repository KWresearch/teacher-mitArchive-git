1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:15,840
Let's now turn to problem number
three, which is 22-36.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,470
We have a y, and we
have a x-axis.

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,000
This is x and this is y.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,570
There is a charge q1 at these
locations in x and y.

6
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:40,420
Here is q1 and there is here a
charge q2, and q1 is positive

7
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,960
and is 4 times 10 to
the - 9 coulomb.

8
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:53,500
Also, q2 equals - 6 times
10 to the - 9 coulomb.

9
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,700
You're being asked: What
is the electric

10
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:59,510
field at the original?

11
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,120
How is an electric
field defined?

12
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,950
If I have a point A here, I have
a point B here, and there

13
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:11,060
is a charge plus q here at point
B, then the electric

14
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:17,530
field is defined radially
outwards from B pointing in

15
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,460
the direction of A, because
this is a positive charge.

16
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,380
If this were a negative charge,
it would be reversed,

17
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,730
and it would be pointing to in
the direction of B, so I

18
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,850
called it E of A. If the
separation between them is R,

19
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:37,670
then E of A, if I take the
magnitude of it now, is the

20
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,960
charge at location
q divided by four

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,500
pi epsilon 0 r squared.

22
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,450
I have already indicated
the direction.

23
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,070
The use of electric field,
which, by the way, has as a

24
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,520
unit newtons per coulomb, is the
following: If you were to

25
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,930
place at location A the charge
capital Q, then the force that

26
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,410
this capital Q would experience
would be simply the

27
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:11,480
electric fields at A times
capital Q. That's the reason

28
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,270
why electric fields
is introduced.

29
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,100
Let us now be specific here,
and first calculate the

30
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,490
electric field due
to this point q1.

31
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,870

32
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:32,620
Here is that electric field E1,
and I will decompose it

33
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,410
into the x- and into
the y-direction.

34
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:48,065
Here is E1 in the y-direction,
and here we have E1 in the

35
00:02:48,065 --> 00:02:50,080
x-direction.

36
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:58,070
The separation from O to q1 is
one meter, and the angle here

37
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,330
I will call theta, so this
is also theta, and

38
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,580
this is also theta.

39
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,640

40
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,435
What is the magnitude of E1?

41
00:03:07,435 --> 00:03:11,610
Let's do that first. The
magnitude of E1--

42
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,000
I put a bar here, so
it is magnitude--

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,910
is simply this charge here, 4
times 10 to the - 9 times 9

44
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,320
times 10 the plus 9, because
that's the 1 over 4 pi epsilon

45
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,470
0 divided by the distance
squared, which is one squared.

46
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,840
This is 36 newtons
per coulomb.

47
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,790
What, now, are the
x-components?

48
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:45,835
I now have to multiply by the
cosine of theta, so E1 in the

49
00:03:45,835 --> 00:03:49,320
x-direction, then multiplying
by the cosine of this angle

50
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:55,750
theta would be - 28.8
newtons per coulomb.

51
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,910
Why minus?

52
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,460
Because it's pointing in
the minus x-direction.

53
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,710
What is E1y?

54
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,600

55
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,740
Now I have to multiply by the
sine of theta, and so I get -

56
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,910
21.6 newtons per coulomb.

57
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,860
Why minus?

58
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,500
Because clearly you can
see it's pointing

59
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,490
in the minus direction.

60
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:23,590
I have to also calculate the
electric field due to q2.

61
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,150
q2 is negative, so it
is pointing in the

62
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,030
direction of q2.

63
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,460
I call this E2.

64
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,360
It turns out it has only a
component in the x-direction,

65
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,150
so E2 you should be able to
find now quite easily.

66
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,380
It is already in the
x-direction, so I can already

67
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:48,130
put an x here that if you put
in the numbers, it will turn

68
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,830
out to be 84.44 newtons
per coulomb.

69
00:04:53,830 --> 00:05:01,750
You know have to calculate then
net electric fields, so

70
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:08,476
you have to take E1 and E2,
E net, vectorially.

71
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:14,050
It equals E1 plus E2, and I'm
sure you can do that.

72
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:20,520
It's a parallelogram, so this is
the net electric field, and

73
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,600
you should have no problems
calculating both the magnitude

74
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,650
as well as this angle alpha.

75
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,510
I will leave you with that.

76
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,730
That should not pose
any more problems.
