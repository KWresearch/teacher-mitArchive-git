1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,820

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,280
That brings us, then, to
problem number four--

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,780
this is a semi-classic, 24-68.

4
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:22,850
I have an insulating arc, which
is half a circle, and I

5
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:30,540
put a charge here on the arc
at a uniform density.

6
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:35,740
I have a total charge of Q on
the arc, and the radius

7
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,700
of the arc is a--

8
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,590
it's only half an arc.

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,550
Lambda, if you want to express
it how many coulombs there are

10
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,660
per meter, lambda would be
Q divided by half the

11
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,680
circumference, so
that it's pi a.

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,240

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,510
Now you're being asked: what is
the potential at that point

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,990
P, right at the center
of that arc?

15
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,840
As I said earlier, the potential
is a scalar--

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,570
it's not a vector.

17
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,000
The advantage of scalars is that
you don't have to take

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,150
into account directions--

19
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,050
they have no direction, so all
you have to do is just add up

20
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,530
the individual potentials from
each one of those little

21
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,710
sections over the arc, and
that's exactly what

22
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,040
I'm going to do.

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,640
I'm going to carve out here
a little section, dx.

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,510
That little section dx contains
a charge dq, which is

25
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:33,800
lambda times dx, which is
therefore Q divided

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,280
by pi a times dx.

27
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,820
That is the little amount
of charge here.

28
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,810
The potential at the point P as
a result of this charge, if

29
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,130
I assume that infinity
is 0, that potential,

30
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,690
which I will call dVp--

31
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,395
it's only a teeny weeny little
bit due to this section dx.

32
00:01:55,395 --> 00:02:03,835
It therefore equals Q divided
by pi a divided by 4

33
00:02:03,835 --> 00:02:09,400
pi a epsilon 0.

34
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,230
Remember, it's 4 pi
epsilon 0 r--

35
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,415
r is the distance from the
charge to that point P, and

36
00:02:15,415 --> 00:02:17,370
we've seen it in our
previous problems--

37
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,280
so that's why this a is
there times the x.

38
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,460
Now I have to add all these
elements of dx, so

39
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,010
that makes it easy--

40
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,580
I do an integral, and the
integral has to be

41
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,320
done along the arc.

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:39,570
That will give me that V p is
Q divided by pi a divided by

43
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,780
this times the integral
along the arc of dx.

44
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,350
The integral along the arc
of dx itself is pi a, so

45
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,040
I lose the pi a.

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,700
I get Q divided by 4 pi
epsilon 0 times a--

47
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,960
that would be the potential
at this point

48
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,210
P due to this half-arc.

49
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:08,030

50
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,530
Now you are being asked
what is the electric

51
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,990
field at point P?

52
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,060
That's harder, because the
electric field is a vector, so

53
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:22,950
now if you take this little
element, the positive charge

54
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,470
here would have a small e vector
is this direction.

55
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,220
But if you take the little
element here, that would have

56
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,030
e vector in this direction,
and if you take the small

57
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:35,650
element here, that would have an
e vector in this direction.

58
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,200
You will have to add up all
these e vectors to get the net

59
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,380
e vector, and I will help you
a little bit: the net e

60
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:49,400
vector, I claim, must be
in the direction e net.

61
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,230
That goes right through the
center of this arc.

62
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,600
The reason for that is that
it's clear that the y

63
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,210
components--

64
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,100
if I called these the
y components--

65
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,450
will cancel because of the
symmetry of the problem.

66
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,040
What I have here below this
horizontal line is exactly

67
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,530
what I have here, so you don't
even have to worry about the y

68
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,560
components--

69
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,290
all you have to do is
calculate all the x

70
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,430
components, due to all these
little elements.

71
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,070
Then you have to do an integral
over the whole arc,

72
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,950
forgetting the y components,
and out comes the net e

73
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,140
vector, which will
be, I guarantee

74
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,120
you, in this direction.

75
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,204
