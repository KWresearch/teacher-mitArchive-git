1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,580

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,240
Problem number four is a very
interesting problem, and I

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,610
would say it is very important
problem, too.

4
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,910
I have a very long wire--

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,620
we think of it as infinitely
long-- with a charge per unit

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,400
length, which I call lambda
3 times 10 to the -

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,140
10 coulomb per meter.

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,890
Here is this long wire,
and here is x = 0.

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,390
I'm asking you a question which
is not asked by your

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,210
teachers, but I want to do that
first, and then you'll

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,860
see that the rest comes
out very easily.

12
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:48,150
That question is what is the
electric field at a location d

13
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,960
anywhere away from the wire?

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,690
The way we can do that is in two
ways: either we do it in a

15
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,010
nasty way, which is the way
that Chapter 22 is dealing

16
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,470
with it, or we do it in a
beautiful, easy way, which is

17
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,940
Chapter 23, which
is Gauss' Law.

18
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,910
I will do both.

19
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:11,110
I feel obligated to do the nasty
way, because after all,

20
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:14,060
the problem has a number 22.

21
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:20,650
The nasty way: here, I select as
location x a small element

22
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:25,800
dx, which therefore contains
a charge dq, and is

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,520
lambda times dx.

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,570
This little charge element,
alone, will produce at this

25
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,140
location an electric field
in this direction

26
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,670
which I will call dE--

27
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,920
it is a vector.

28
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,970

29
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,672
I can decompose that into
this direction--

30
00:01:51,672 --> 00:01:53,000
the y direction--

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,620
so this will be dE y, and I can
decompose that into this

32
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,810
direction, which
would be dE x.

33
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,800
We have an angle theta
here, and we have

34
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,550
an angle theta there.

35
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,510
This distance from this
point to this charge--

36
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,060
I will call that little r--

37
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:23,150
equals the square root of
d squared + x squared.

38
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,820

39
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:32,340
First, the nasty way: I first
want you to appreciate that

40
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,131
easy calculating dE
is very easy.

41
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:38,080

42
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,600
The magnitude of dE--

43
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,570
only the magnitude--

44
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:50,320
equals 3 times 10 to the - 10
times 9 times 10 to the 9

45
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,370
times dx divided by that
distance r squared.

46
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:01,050
When you put in the numbers,
you'll find 2.7 divided by r

47
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,750
squared times dx.

48
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,370
That's the magnitude.

49
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,820
Now clearly, if you add up all
these elements here, there

50
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,010
cannot be any net vector
in the x direction--

51
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,750
they will all cancel out,
so the only one that

52
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,340
survives is this one.

53
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,940
I don't even bother about
the x direction--

54
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:29,090
I only calculate dE in
the y direction.

55
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:35,240
That is this value times the
sine of theta, and I find then

56
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:43,530
2.7 d divided by r
cubed times dx.

57
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,080
If I now wants to know what the
total value for E y is, I

58
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,760
have to execute the integral
from x all the way for -

59
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:59,980
infinity through plus infinity
of dx divided by r cubed, and

60
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,980
I will write down for r cubed
d squared plus x squared to

61
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,330
the power of 3/2.

62
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,240
To be frank with you, I'm not
very good at integrals, and I

63
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,450
find this a very
nasty integral.

64
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,500
I looked it up, and
I did even better.

65
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,860
I asked my graduate student
to confirm it.

66
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,520
If you do this integral
correctly, and I'm sure you

67
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,380
are better at it that
I am, then it is 2

68
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,960
divided by d squared.

69
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:40,570
So the net result is that E y
then becomes 5.4 divided by d,

70
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:47,300
and if E y has to be 0.5 newtons
per coulomb, that will

71
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,940
be the case if the
distance through

72
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,860
the wire is 2.8 meters.

73
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,993
So far, the nasty solution.

74
00:04:56,993 --> 00:04:59,370
Now, the beautiful solution--

75
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:06,070
Gauss' Law, which you will
learn in Chapter 23.

76
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,356
Suppose I have here a closed
surface-- it is essential that

77
00:05:09,356 --> 00:05:09,930
it is closed.

78
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,530
There cannot be an opening.

79
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,610
At the surface here, I have
small surface elements, and I

80
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:23,570
erect small vectors,
all perpendicular

81
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,310
to the local surface.

82
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:30,895
We have a ds here, and a ds
here, and by convention, they

83
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:34,410
are always pointing outwards
from inside the surface to

84
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,980
outside the surface.

85
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,190
There could be an electric field
vector here due to the

86
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,160
charge that is inside here,
there could be an electric

87
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,770
field here, and there could
be an electric field here.

88
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:53,060
What Gauss' Law now tells me
is that the closed surface

89
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:59,760
integral over this entire
surface of E dot ds--

90
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,060
it is a dot product--

91
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,320
equals the total charge
inside this volume

92
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,630
divided by epsilon 0.

93
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,780
I can only use Gauss' Law in a
meaningful way if I can create

94
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,370
geometry which is easy.

95
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,170
Easy geometries always require
symmetry, and you can only got

96
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:30,140
symmetry with spheres,
cylinders, and with planes.

97
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,810
We'll do one of each, and this
is going to be the cylinder.

98
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,720

99
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,150
Here is my infinitely long
wire, and I am going to

100
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,260
introduce what I call
a Gaussian surface.

101
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,940
It must be a closed surface,
and think of it as being a

102
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,830
coin, which could have any
width that you want to.

103
00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:01,200
This would be a cross
section of the coin.

104
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,180
The thickness of the coin
is unimportant--

105
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:09,610
I'll call it l, and this now in
distance d from the wire.

106
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,840
If I try to make it look a
little bit three dimensional,

107
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,090
which is always a little
difficult, then it would look

108
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,750
like this--

109
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,620
so this is the coin.

110
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,540
It's actually a little
cylinder, but

111
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,520
it's completely closed.

112
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,445
I hope you realize that--
it's a closed surface.

113
00:07:29,445 --> 00:07:32,950

114
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:41,780
The E field right here at the
ends must be pointing outwards

115
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,880
for reasons of symmetry.

116
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,710
There cannot be any components
like this or that-- nature

117
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,990
cannot decide between left and
right, and so the E field here

118
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,080
must also be pointing outwards,
radially outwards.

119
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,570
It's the same here, the same
here, but also on any surface

120
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:06,370
element here, it must be
pointing radially outwards.

121
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:12,760
In other words, if I looked at
this surface from this side--

122
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:19,020
and if this were that surface
which then had a radius d--

123
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,590
then everywhere at the surface,
the E fields must be

124
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:27,050
pointing radially outwards
for reasons of symmetry.

125
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,570

126
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,140
How about the values of ds?

127
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:38,532
Well, ds per definition is
pointing outwards, so ds here

128
00:08:38,532 --> 00:08:45,120
is also pointing outwards, and
ds here is pointing outwards.

129
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,020
Everywhere where we have here
these E vectors, the ds and

130
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,060
the E's, are in the
same direction.

131
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,560
The dot product can be ignored,
because the cosine

132
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,720
between the angle between
E and ds is 1.

133
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,810
Let us calculate the electric
flux that goes out from this

134
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,990
curved surface.

135
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,970
That should be very easy: that
is the surface area itself,

136
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:19,350
which is 2 pi times d.

137
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:24,600
It has here a thickness l, so
this is now the total volume--

138
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,310
not volume, this is the
total surface area

139
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:29,410
of this curved surface.

140
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:34,010
I multiply that by E, according
to Gauss' Law.

141
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:39,760
I have to add now the flux that
escapes from the sides,

142
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:46,840
and that then equals 3 times
10 to the - 10--

143
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,040
that is the charge that is
located here at the wire,

144
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:56,870
which has a length l times
l divided by epsilon 0.

145
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,270
What is the flux that escapes
from the sides?

146
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:06,480
The flux that escapes from the
sides is 0, because ds is

147
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,680
always perpendicular to the
surface, and is therefore is

148
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,980
in this entire problem
for this side.

149
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,330
For this side of the coin, the
ds dot E is 0, because E and

150
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,500
ds are perpendicular
to each other--

151
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,100
so there is nothing
here, and it is 0.

152
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:31,570
You'll find immediately what the
E vector is, and you see

153
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:37,220
that l cancels, because nature
couldn't care less how wide

154
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:40,880
you take this cylinder.

155
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,990
If you work this out, you will
see that you find exactly the

156
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:46,460
same result as you had before.

157
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,650
But the beauty--

158
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,480
think of the beauty.

159
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,410
There's no nasty integrals, just
a choice, and that's very

160
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,240
important--

161
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,310
the choice of one nicely
symmetric geometric surface.

162
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,280
It must be symmetric, otherwise
you're nowhere.

163
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,985
You apply Gauss' Law-- you don't
even have to think, but

164
00:11:06,985 --> 00:11:09,580
you have to be careful
that you take the dot

165
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,610
product into account.

166
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:14,510
It's very often that you can set
it up in such a way that

167
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,000
the dot product is
only non-zero

168
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,290
through certain surface--

169
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,610
in this case, through
the curved one--

170
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,300
and that it is zero through
other surfaces, which in this

171
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,350
case is the flat ones.

172
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:30,020
Then you execute the recipe, you
don't even think anymore,

173
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,090
and the E field pops out.

174
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,980
Gauss' Law is fantastic--

175
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,440
it cannot always be used
if there's no symmetry.

176
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,900
It's always correct, though,
but you can use it to your

177
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:48,090
advantage if you choose the
right surfaces and put in the

178
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,460
right symmetry.

179
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,330
The charge distributions also
have to be symmetric--

180
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,130
otherwise, it's pretty
hopeless.

181
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:55,582
