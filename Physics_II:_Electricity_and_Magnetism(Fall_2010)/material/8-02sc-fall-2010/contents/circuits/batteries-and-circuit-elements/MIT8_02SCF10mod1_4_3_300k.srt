1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,730
Problem number 4.

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:12,820
26-21.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,830
I have a 12 volt battery
and it has a

5
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,230
capacitance of 60 amp hours.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:25,120
It has an internal resistance
of 0.31 ohm.

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,202
And it takes 4 hours to
charge it at 15 amps.

8
00:00:30,202 --> 00:00:31,610
It's a given.

9
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:35,100
You get 60 amp hours.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,460
Now here is one end
of the battery.

11
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,300
Here is the negative side
of the battery.

12
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,370
Here the positive side.

13
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,430
Here is the 12 volts.

14
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,870
Let's call this point 'b'.

15
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,250
Then here is the internal
resistance of the battery,

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,720
which you know.

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,620
And then here is the terminal
of the battery.

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,280
These are the only two points
that you have access to.

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,780
Now you are going to charge
this battery.

20
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,910
But how are you going to
charge this battery?

21
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:10,300
You are going to put
in here a current.

22
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,210
A charge current given
to be 15 amperes.

23
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,790
Clearly, if you want to
discharge the battery through

24
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,770
some flashlight or something
else, the current will flow in

25
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,880
this direction and the battery
would discharge.

26
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,390
Therefore, if you charge the
battery you have to put the

27
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,210
current in the opposite
direction, which is exactly

28
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,510
what I am doing here.

29
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,200
And the question now is, what is
'Vc', if I call this point

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,570
'c', minus 'Va'?

31
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:42,630
To while I'm charging, what is
this potential difference?

32
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:50,540
Well, 'Vc' minus 'Va'
is ''Vc' minus 'Vb''

33
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:56,530
plus ''Vb' minus 'Va''.

34
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,430
But this is 12 volts.

35
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,446
And this is that charging
current of 15 amperes times

36
00:02:04,446 --> 00:02:06,870
the internal resistance.

37
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:11,130
You know 'i', you know 'Ri', you
know 12, and so you find

38
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,890
immediately that
'Vc' minus 'Va'

39
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,650
happens to be 16.65 volts.

40
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,010
And it shouldn't surprise
you that you

41
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,120
have to use a battery.

42
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,910
Because effectively what you're
doing is you're going

43
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,690
to, of course, attach
a battery to here.

44
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,802
[WHISTLES]

45
00:02:29,802 --> 00:02:33,450
With the plus side here and the
minus side here to drive

46
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,930
that current through this
battery against its own will,

47
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,440
so to speak.

48
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,480
That this battery needs a larger
EMF of 16.65 volts in

49
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,020
order to charge up this battery,
which itself will

50
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,590
only deliver 12 volts.

51
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,710
Reason being this internal
resistance.

52
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,350
What is now the total
energy that is

53
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,280
supplied during charging?

54
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,330
Well, during charging the total
energy, the total power,

55
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:11,760
I should say, that is supplied
is the total voltage that I

56
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,120
applied, which is the 16.65,
times the total power,

57
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,300
which is the 15.

58
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,580
And if I did not make
a mistake, I

59
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,710
believe it is 250 watts.

60
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,040
You better check that.

61
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,980
So this is the total power
that is delivered to the

62
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,320
battery during the charging.

63
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:41,580
Now in 4 hours, which is 4
times 3,600 seconds, the

64
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,890
amount of joules that I pump
into the battery is, of

65
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,110
course, the time times
the power.

66
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:57,380
And that, I found, is 3.6 times
10 to the sixth joules.

67
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:02,500
That's almost a little more
than 3.5 million joules.

68
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,590
But now comes an interesting
question under c.

69
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,720
As I am charging, how much
energy is dissipated in that

70
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,600
internal resistance
in the battery?

71
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,640
Well, that is of course, the
time, which is the same as 4

72
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,090
times 3,600 seconds, times the
current squared through that

73
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,580
internal resistance, which is
your 15 amperes, times the

74
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,660
internal resistance itself,
which you also know is 0.31

75
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,640
ohms.

76
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,070
And you find now that this
is a huge amount.

77
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,650
That this is 1 million joules.

78
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:37,780
So you put in 3.6.

79
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,470
But as you put in 3.6 in
the whole system--

80
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,860
that means you put it both
in the battery and in the

81
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,320
internal resistance--

82
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,740
1 million of that gets lost in
terms of heat of that internal

83
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,310
resistance.

84
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,010
Internal resistance gets
hot and its gone.

85
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,260
You're heating up
the universe.

86
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,810
1 million joules.

87
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,720
So when the battery is
completely discharged, and I

88
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,730
do that through a external
resistor.

89
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,080
Here is your 'Ri'.

90
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,580
Here is your 12 volts.

91
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,520
Your terminals of
your battery.

92
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,700
And I'm going to, here, put now
an external resistance.

93
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,790
This charging this battery.

94
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,300

95
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:38,700
And I'm going to discharge this
battery at a current of

96
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,130
15 amperes--

97
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,720
that's what you're
being told--

98
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,440
and it will take 4 hours because
the battery has a

99
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,740
capacity of 60 amp hours.

100
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,180
So for 4 hours, will
this continue?

101
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,570
Let's assume that the current
remains constant, which is a

102
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,490
little bit naive to think
because this value for 'Ri'

103
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,910
will probably go up with time.

104
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,370
But we ignore that for
now for convenience.

105
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:06,970
And now what we are being asked
is what now is this

106
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,890
external resistance?

107
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:14,600
Well, I would suggest that
we use Kirchhoff's Law.

108
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,630
We start here, we go all the
way around the circle, and

109
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,680
then the sum of all potential
differences--

110
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,370
I will write that down in
shorthand notation--

111
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:30,215
going all the way around must
be 0 in this problem.

112
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:32,980
Now, I'm going to make an
agreement with you.

113
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,310
Whenever I go uphill--

114
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,740
that means whenever I
go up in potential--

115
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,910
I call that plus, and then
whenever I go downhill I call

116
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,120
that minus.

117
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,600
You don't have to do that.

118
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:49,480
You can reverse this and your
answer will be no different.

119
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,620
So I'm going to start here,
and I'm going to go around

120
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,645
counter clockwise.

121
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:56,250
If you prefer to go around
clockwise it would make no

122
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,980
difference.

123
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,480
So be careful.

124
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,885
The current comes to me.

125
00:07:00,885 --> 00:07:03,960
The resistance is
'R external', so

126
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,740
I'm going up in potential.

127
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,120
The potential here is
higher than here.

128
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,720
Uphill is plus.

129
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,142
So I've got 15 times
are 'R external'.

130
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,520
Now the current here is
also coming to me.

131
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,860
So I also go from a lower

132
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,330
potential to a higher potential.

133
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:27,520
So I get plus 0.31 times
the same, 15 amperes.

134
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,800
But here now I go down
in potential.

135
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,145
And when I go down in potential
we agreed it would

136
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:35,440
be a minus sign.

137
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,950
So this is minus 12 equals 0.

138
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,810
I know everything in this
equation except this.

139
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:49,940
And I find, I believe, 0.49
ohms. So that is now the

140
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,060
external resitor.

141
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,410
And now comes the question, how
much energy is supplied to

142
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,640
this external resistor
during the discharge?

143
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,775
Well, the discharge
takes 4 hours.

144
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:04,910
There you go.

145
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:08,640
I must multiply that by ''i'
squared R' going through that

146
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:14,870
external resistor, times the
external resistor itself.

147
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,670
You know all numbers.

148
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,770
And what do you find?

149
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,910
1.6 times 10 to the
sixth joules.

150
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,670
And now the question is, where
is all this energy now?

151
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,760
To charge it up we needed
3.6 million joules.

152
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,680
But while we were charging we
lost 1 million to this stupid

153
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,950
internal resistor.

154
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,330
In terms of heat.

155
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,730
And now we are discharging
and it seems that we

156
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,400
lot another 1 million.

157
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,080
Because we only end
up with 1.6.

158
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,720
Here.

159
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,320
3.6 went to 1.6.

160
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,530
So where did this other 1
million go to when I was

161
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,010
discharging?

162
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,450
So what it comes down
to is, we lost 2

163
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,980
million joules somehow.

164
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,420
And I would like you to
tell me exactly when

165
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,050
and where and how.
