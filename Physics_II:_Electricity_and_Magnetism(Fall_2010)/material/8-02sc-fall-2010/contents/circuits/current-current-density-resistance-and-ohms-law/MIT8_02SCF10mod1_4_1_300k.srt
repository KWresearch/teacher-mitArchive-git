1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,610
Very well.

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:12,380
So let's now go to problem
number one.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,320
Problem number one is 26-4.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,180
It's In a silver wire and you're
being asked, what is

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,400
the current through the wire?

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,250
Well, the current through the
wire is the charge through the

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,080
wire divided by the time
that it takes for

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,620
that charge to flow.

10
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,080
You know the charge is given,
you know the time is given, so

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,760
clearly you can calculate
the current.

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:47,220
The current density 'J' if that
current divided by the

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,050
cross sectional area.

14
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,240

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:59,320
Which in the case of the silver
thread, the silver wire

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,820
is just the 'pi r squared'
of the cross section.

17
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:13,070
But if you look in section 26-7,
where the idea of drift

18
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,540
velocities are discussed, you
will see that it is also equal

19
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:21,810
to 'n', which is the number of
free electrons per cubic meter

20
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,010
in the metal.

21
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,360
'q' is the charge
of the electron

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,000
times that drift velocity.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,670
Average drift velocity,
I should say.

24
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,260
And if you want to be really
cute, complete should say

25
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,510
there has to be here--

26
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:38,140

27
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,970
a vector then there has
to be a vector here.

28
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:46,220
So since you know the number
of free charges per cubic

29
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,560
meter, you know the charge
of an electron.

30
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,720
You know the 'J' because you
just calculated I, and so

31
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,870
obviously you'll find
the drift velocity.

32
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,610
And the drift velocity is of
the order of microns per

33
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,690
second, which is exceedingly
low.

34
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,260
I mean, it is so low you cannot
even imagine that these

35
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,290
electrons would drift
so slowly.

36
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:15,670
And this comes down to a major
misconception that most

37
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,550
physicists have. Most physicists
think that the

38
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:23,690
energy that is transported by
the silver wire, in this case,

39
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,240
is in the form of kinetic
energy of the electron.

40
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,590
But that's not the case.

41
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,850
If I would here have the silver
wire and a certain

42
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,020
current, 'I', would come in.

43
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:44,390
And I had here a resistor, and
say resistor 'R' for something

44
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:50,090
like 100 ohms. And we both know,
or should know, that the

45
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:56,540
power dissipated by this
resistor equals 'I squared R'.

46
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:03,520
And the energy dissipated is the
power times the time that

47
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,290
you let the energy come
out every second.

48
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:18,930
Now, the drift velocity, as
you will see, can be made

49
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,290
arbitrarily small by making that
cross sectional area of

50
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,230
the wire very, very,
very large.

51
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,916
You will see that immediately.

52
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:33,620
Because notice that if you make
this cross sectional area

53
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,580
very large and you keep the
current the same, then 'J'

54
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,260
would come down.

55
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,800
So the drift velocity
will come down.

56
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,060
And so you can come down to a

57
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,420
negligibly small drift velocity.

58
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:52,390
And if the energy that is going
into this resistor 'R',

59
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:58,700
if that were really the sum of
all the kinetic energies of

60
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,470
the electrons with the mean
drift velocity, 'Vd', that was

61
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,920
the sum of all these
electrons, then

62
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,880
obviously that cannot be.

63
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,790
Because this one, this drift
velocity we can make

64
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,260
arbitrarily small.

65
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,640
Whereas this number
is now changing.

66
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,960
It's independent of this
drift velocity.

67
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,780
But there are very difficult
concepts and I want you to

68
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,210
think about that.

69
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,290
It's not so obvious.

70
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,970
And to be frank with you,
it's not something

71
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,020
you can easily see.

72
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:29,020
But what I want you to remember
is that the energy

73
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:35,080
that is transported through a
wire to a resistor and the

74
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,700
energy comes out in the form of
heat, that that energy is

75
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,770
not going through the wire
in terms of kinetic

76
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,240
energy of the electrons.

77
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,218
