1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,650

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:11,080
We are going now to problem
number two.

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,260
Here I have a wire with a
certain cross section.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,430

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,510
Cross sectional area.

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,880
Here is point 'a' on the wire,
here is point 'b'.

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,350
The length of the wire is 'L'.

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,570
I believe it's 8 meters--

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,330
it's not so important now.

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:33,362
And there is a current going
through the wire 'i'.

11
00:00:33,362 --> 00:00:36,270
And as a result of that, if
the wire has a finite

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,060
resistance then there is an
electric field in the wire.

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,370
Now 'Va' minus 'Vb'-- there
is the potential

14
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,540
difference over the wire--

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,020
is given.

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,510
I should say, is given.

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,770

18
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:59,240
And also, what you're being told
is the current density.

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,290
It is also given.

20
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,750
So those are the two things
that you know.

21
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,010
And the question now is,
what is the electric

22
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,940
field in that wire?

23
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,410
And what is the resistivity
of the wire?

24
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,580
Well, let's first write
down what it

25
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,000
means, 'Va' minus 'Vb'.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,340
That's the integral of going
from 'a' to 'b' of 'E' dot

27
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,430
'dl' dot product.

28
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,760
'E' and 'dl' are in the
same direction if I go

29
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,090
from here to there.

30
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,920
And since 'E' presumably is
constant throughout the wire,

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,410
this is simply equals 'El'.

32
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,550
Well, since you knew 'Va' minus
'Vb' and you know what

33
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:48,360
'l' is, out pops 'E'.

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,090
But that's an easy one.

35
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,680
As far as the resistivity is
concerned, the current density

36
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:03,370
'J' equals the electric field
vector divided by the

37
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,520
resistivity.

38
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,140
Check equation 26-21.

39
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:14,750
Well, we know 'J' we just
calculated 'E', out pops rho

40
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,220
So again, that is not a very
difficult problem.
