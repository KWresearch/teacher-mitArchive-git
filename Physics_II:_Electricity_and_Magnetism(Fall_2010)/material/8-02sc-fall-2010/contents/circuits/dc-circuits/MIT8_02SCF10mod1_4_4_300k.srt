1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,170

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,610
6.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,520
27-16.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,320
Oh, my goodness.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,290
Oh, my goodness.

6
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,260
I have to draw a
large diagram.

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,420
Plus-minus 20 here.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,410
1 ohm.

9
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,290
Here is a resistor.

10
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,880
6 ohms. Comes down.

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,140
Comes down the point 'a'.

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:43,280
Here is resistor, 4 ohms. Here
is a resistor, 1 ohm.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,470
Then there is a battery of which
we do not know the EMF.

14
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,640
We call it 'E1'--

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,850
this is the plus side and
this is the minus side.

16
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,040
Goes to point 'b'.

17
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,520
But that's not all.

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,200
Here is a resistor, 1 ohm.

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,740
And then there is another
battery of which we do not

20
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,870
know the EMF, 'E2'.

21
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,980
Plus side, minus side.

22
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,520
And then there is here
a resistor, 2

23
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,440
ohms. And that is it.

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,240
And what you also are being
told, and I believe that's

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,740
all, that the current through
here is 1 ampere, and that the

26
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,380
current through here
is 2 amperes.

27
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,920
Now follow me very
closely now.

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,530
Charge cannot pile up.

29
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,560
Whatever charge flows in here
per second must flow out here

30
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,140
per second.

31
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,780
And that holds for this
point, for this

32
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,500
point, for this point--

33
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,750
it holds for any point
in the circuit.

34
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,850
If 1 ampere flows in and 2
amperes flow out, well, then

35
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,000
clearly there must have come
1 ampere from the sides.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,510
Otherwise never 2 amperes
could come down here.

37
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,430
So also through here
there is 1 ampere.

38
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,110
But these 2 amperes keep
going down here--

39
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,290
2 amperes--

40
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,200
arrives here at this
point 'b'.

41
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,860
1 ampere goes to the left, so
it is a must that 1 ampere

42
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,260
goes this way.

43
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,170
Otherwise there would be a
pile up of charge here.

44
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:21,370
And so 1 ampere then goes
through this whole train here,

45
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,280
and indeed, ah.

46
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,890
You see that's exactly
what we have--

47
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,870
1 ampere.

48
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,860
And now what you're being asked
is what is the EMF of

49
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,350
battery one, EMF of battery two,
and what is the potential

50
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,630
difference from here to here?

51
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,490
I'm going to apply
Kirchhoff's Law.

52
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,850
I start at this point 'b', but
you can start at any point and

53
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,670
do close circles.

54
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:49,060
And I will go counter
clockwise.

55
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,710
And the first loop that I will
choose is the loop that goes

56
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,570
all the way around.

57
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,620
From here to here
to here to here.

58
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,450
So I ignore this inner part.

59
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,650
And remember, plus is uphill,
minus is downhill.

60
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,760

61
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,260
OK.

62
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,480
So here we are.

63
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,790
We're going this way, we're
going this way.

64
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,340
This point has a higher
potential than this-- the

65
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,260
current is in this direction--

66
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,820
so I go downhill.

67
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,300
So I get minus 6.

68
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,140
Now I go uphill.

69
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,600
I go to a higher potential.

70
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,020
Plus 20.

71
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,000
Now the current is in
this direction so I

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,375
go to a lower potential.

73
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:37,470
So it's minus 1.

74
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,860
Nothing here, nothing
here, nothing here.

75
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,530
Current is in this direction,
I go to a lower potential--

76
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,280
minus 2.

77
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,940
I reach this battery, I go from
a high potential to a low

78
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,350
potential, I go downhill--

79
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,890
minus E2'.

80
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,130
I go through this resistor, 2
ohms, 2 amperes, potential

81
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,880
difference is 4 volts, I go
to a lower potential,

82
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,990
minus 4 equals 0.

83
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,140
One equation with one unknown.

84
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:14,600
And I find that EMF of that
battery equals 7 volts.

85
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,550
Now I have a choice.

86
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,680
I can take this loop.

87
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,500
Or I can take this loop.

88
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,970
I can go clockwise, I can
go counter clockwise.

89
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,050
It should all make
no difference.

90
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:30,410
I have decided to take this loop
and go counter clockwise.

91
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,890
Where you start doesn't matter,
but I will start again

92
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,170
at the point b.

93
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,890
So I go up here.

94
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,070
Nothing happens.

95
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,590
I climb up the potential.

96
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:47,970
This is higher than that,
so I get plus 'E1'.

97
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,350
Here I have 1 ampere going
through 1 ohm.

98
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:56,170
I go downhill in potential,
minus 1.

99
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,880
Here I go 4 volts down in
potential, minus 4.

100
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,260
I come around here, I
go 2 volts down in

101
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,460
potential, minus 2.

102
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,510
Here I see 'E2'.

103
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,030
I go down in potential.

104
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,660
7 volts down in potential,
minus 7.

105
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,450
Here I go 4 volts down in
potential, minus 4.

106
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,660
And according to Kirchhoff's
Law that is 0.

107
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,190
And if I did not make a mistake,
I find that the EMF

108
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:30,630
of that battery is +18 volts.

109
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,120
So I've used Kirchhoff's
Law twice.

110
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,540
First this route to
get this one.

111
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,280
And then this route
to get this one.

112
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,930
But you could have chosen
other routes.

113
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,610
As long as you make close
loops and the direction

114
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,470
doesn't matter, but what does
matter that you are very

115
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,890
disciplinized in what
you call 'plus' and

116
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,250
what you call 'minus'.

117
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,140
If you want to call uphill
minus, be my guess.

118
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,880
That's OK.

119
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,630
I call uphill plus.

120
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,160
But you must do it in
a consistent way.

121
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,470
And now you're being asked
what is the potential

122
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:08,960
difference between
'Vb' minus 'Va'.

123
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,560
Well, I think you
can do that one.

124
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,320
I've no doubts.
