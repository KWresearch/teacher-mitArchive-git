1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,490

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:13,300
Problem number 7,
which is 27-53.

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,960
A very interesting, very
interesting, problem.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,780
Here is 6 ohm.

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,890
I call this point P.
Here is 3 ohm.

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,080
I will delete the word
ohm, the symbol ohm.

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,510
This is 3 ohm.

8
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,950
Switch 'S'.

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,950
Continues here.

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,200
3 ohm.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,640

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,520
6 ohm.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,400
This point connected
to a battery.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,050

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:57,070
Plus minus 36 volts all the
way back to point 'P'.

16
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,860
And that's the circuit.

17
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,310
And as we start 'S' is open.

18
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,800
And you are being asked, what
is the potential difference

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:14,010
between this point 'a'
and this point 'b'?

20
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,770
If the switch is open, there's
no current flowing through

21
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,130
here, there is 36
volts over here,

22
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:22,970
there is 9 ohm in series.

23
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,570
So Ohm's Law immediately tells
me that the current through

24
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:29,400
here is 4 amperes.

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,830
Here is also 9 ohm.

26
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,580
So also the current for
both these two,

27
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,570
'i', is also 4 ampers.

28
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,010
And no current through here.

29
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,030
What is 'VP' minus 'Va'?

30
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,630
'VP' minus 'Va'?

31
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,570
'P' is a higher potential
than 'a'.

32
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,680
4 ampere 6 ohm.

33
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,790
So there is plus 24 volts.

34
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:00,160
What is 'VP' minus 'Vb'?

35
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,800

36
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,980
'VP' minus 'Vb'?

37
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,650
This has a higher potential than
this, 3 ohms, 4 amperes,

38
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:14,110
that is plus 12 volts.

39
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:20,100
So if you want to know the
potentials, this is 36, this

40
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,030
jump is 24, so that leaves
this with 12.

41
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,950
0 here.

42
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,950
This jump is 12, so that leaves
this with plus 24, and

43
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,170
this jump is 0.

44
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,885
So here you see the
full potentials

45
00:02:32,885 --> 00:02:35,240
at these four positions.

46
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:41,020
And so it's immediately obvious
that 'Va' minus 'Vb'

47
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:47,470
equals 12 minus 24
equals -12 volts.

48
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,130
So therefore, if you throw the
switch, clearly there's going

49
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,450
to be a current going
through here.

50
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,680
That is inevitable.

51
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,600
And that's exactly what
we are going to do.

52
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,560
We're going to close the switch
and we want to know,

53
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,200
what is the current through
that horizontal section?

54
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:15,450
Now I will make a slightly
different drawing.

55
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,810
Not because there was anything
wrong with the previous one,

56
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:22,950
but I just feel like making
a difference drawing.

57
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,590
I don't want to get bored.

58
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,370
So when you don't want
to get bored you

59
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,890
do something different.

60
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,560
This is that point 'P'.

61
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,080
This is that point 'a'.

62
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,980
This is the point 'b'.

63
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,750
Circuit, no change.

64
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:57,090
3 ohms. Here, 6 ohms. This
points is going back, 36 volt

65
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,030
battery, to this point.

66
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,280
And you will convince yourself
that this circuit is

67
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,920
completely identical.

68
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,170
No.

69
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,460

70
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,340
Let current i going
through in here.

71
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,040

72
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,640
And let the current split here
between 'i1' and 'i2'.

73
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,630
So I always know that 'i'
equals 'i1' plus 'i2'.

74
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:28,340
I make now the assumption, which
could be wrong, that

75
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,410
there's also a current flowing
in this direction,

76
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:31,950
which I call 'i3'.

77
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,450
If I find 'i3' later to
be negative, no sweat.

78
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,260
It means that the current
is flowing in

79
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,120
the opposite direction.

80
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,090
So that's no problem.

81
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:45,310
When I come to this point here,
if 'i2' is coming in and

82
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,480
'i3' is going out-- excuse me.

83
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,120

84
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,330
Forgive me--

85
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,090
I call this 'i2' and
I call this 'i1'.

86
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,590
And I realize that it makes no
difference, but since that's

87
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,170
the way I have made my notations
I would like to

88
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,330
stick to that.

89
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,620
So I call this 'i1' and
I call this 'i2'.

90
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,760
So 'i2' comes in, 'i3' comes
out, so then there's only one

91
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,990
way that upwards must
go 'i1' minus 'i3'.

92
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:19,150
And if this number 'i1' minus
'i3' is positive, then indeed

93
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,970
there will be a current
in this direction.

94
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,500
If it is negative then there
will be a current going in

95
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,630
this direction.

96
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,790
Now we come to this point 'a'.

97
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:33,380
'i2' is coming in, 'i1' is
coming in, and 'i3'--

98
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,640
negative.

99
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,060
So therefore, I have
here minus i3.

100
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,130
So that's the current
for this resistor.

101
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,330
But now what's at this point?

102
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,770
'i1' plus 'i2' minus
'i3' plus 'i3'.

103
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,200
So what comes out here
is 'i1' plus 'i2',

104
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,610
which is exactly 'i'.

105
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,350
And so my symbols are internally
completely

106
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,920
consistent.

107
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,470
And so what I have to find now
is I have to find three

108
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,520
equations created with
three unknowns.

109
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,940
I want to know what 'i1'
is, what 'i2' is,

110
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,600
and what 'i3' is.

111
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,850
And then I, of course, also know
'i' because I know that

112
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,820
'i' is 'i1' plus
'i2' plus 'i3'.

113
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,270
And so I have to apply
Kirchhoff's Law three times in

114
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,040
an independent fashion so that
I can get, in a relatively

115
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,970
quick way, 'i1',
'i2', and 'i3'.

116
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,280
All right.

117
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,690
Where do we start?

118
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:34,470
And in what direction are
we going to march?

119
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:40,950
I suggest that we start here.

120
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,840
And I suggest that
we go in this

121
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,540
direction counter clockwise.

122
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,560
And I suggest that our
first journey--

123
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,120
you could, of course, choose
any other journey--

124
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,670
but I suggest that our first
journey is going to be all the

125
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:01,790
way through the top and back.

126
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,040
All the way through
the top and back.

127
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,060
Ready for that?

128
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,380
Uphill.

129
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,960
First, I'm going to make a
little easy table. 'E1', 'i1',

130
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,220
'i2', and 'i3'.

131
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,970
I go uphill 36 volts, so
I have here plus 36.

132
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:29,020
I go downhill '6 times 'i2'',
so I get a minus 6 here.

133
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,480
You must multiply
that by 'i2'.

134
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,800
I go downhill '3 'i1'.

135
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,550
Minus 3.

136
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,720
Downhill '3 'i2''.

137
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,330
Minus 3.

138
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:47,965
Uphill '3 i3', therefore
plus 3.

139
00:07:47,965 --> 00:07:51,340
Because remember, this
is a minus sign.

140
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,330
And I come out here
and I'm finished.

141
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,310
This is 0.

142
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,660
What now is my second
loop going to be?

143
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:01,550
Well, take your pick.

144
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,820
I've decided to take
the lower one.

145
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,530
I could have picked another
one, but I'm going to

146
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,290
pick the lower one.

147
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,500
You ready for the lower one?

148
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,580
36.

149
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,920
I go through here, I
go down '3 'i1''.

150
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,050
Minus 3.

151
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,060
I come here, I go down
in potential.

152
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,460
'6 'i3''.

153
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,660
Minus 6.

154
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,400

155
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,715
And there's a 0 here.

156
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:34,000
Ha.

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,590
There is no 'i2'.

158
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,170
And that equals 0.

159
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:41,100
Now I have to choose
a third loop.

160
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,630
And for my third loop--

161
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,230
watch me carefully--

162
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,720
I could pick this one, I could
pick this one, I could have

163
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,990
picked this one, but I'm
going to pick this one.

164
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:56,630
So here, through here, up
here, down here, this

165
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,670
way, I'm back here.

166
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,620
Why not?

167
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,270
I can choose any
one I want to.

168
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,780
Why not doing that one?

169
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,990
36--

170
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,440
that's this one--

171
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,800
minus '6 'i2''.

172
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,720

173
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,980
Now--

174
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,360
careful--

175
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,700
i1 is coming towards me.

176
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,530
That means I'm going up in
potential because of i1.

177
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,780
So there is plus 3.

178
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,400

179
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,870
But it's going to be
minus 3 for 'i3'.

180
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,930
So now I'm here.

181
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:40,910
I'm going down '6 'i3'', so I
have another minus 6 here.

182
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:45,480
And I come out here,
and this equals 0.

183
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,290
Well, three equations
with three unknowns.

184
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,700
You have to multiply
them, of course.

185
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:56,050
So this is 36 minus '3
'i1'' won't minus '9

186
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:01,040
'i2'' 3 i3 equals 0.

187
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,530
And you can solve these three
equations with three unknowns.

188
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,350
I have a little bit extra time
and I will help you a little,

189
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,940
although I'm not going to
solve them for you.

190
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:14,710
I'm going to divide them all by
3, so I will get 12 minus 1

191
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:18,200
minus 3 plus 1, 0.

192
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,902
12 minus 1, 0, minus 2, 0.

193
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:29,500
12 plus 1 minus 2 minus 3, 0.

194
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,240
I call this equation 1, equation
2, and equation 3.

195
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:43,850
And what is interesting, that
if you subtract 1 from 2--

196
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,696
so 2 minus 1--

197
00:10:45,696 --> 00:10:50,750
if you subtract this one from
this one you find immediately

198
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,790
that 'i2' equals 'i3'.

199
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,710
And that's not so obvious.

200
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,330
And when I found that I said
to myself, maybe there is a

201
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,430
faster way to see that.

202
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:06,860
And so I went back to this
diagram and I looked.

203
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,490
Why?

204
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,420
Is there any obvious reasons why
this current here is the

205
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,350
same as this current here?

206
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,860
Well, there's a lot
of symmetry.

207
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,910
This is a 6, this is a 6, this
is a 3, this is a 3, but then

208
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,530
there is a 3 here.

209
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,040
I'll be very frank with you.

210
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,250
I could not find an obvious
reason why 'i2' is 'i3'.

211
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,800
If you do, I would be very
obliged and very grateful if

212
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,830
you give me a call and
you let me know.

213
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,980
In any case, you can massage
these three equations.

214
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,780
And I think I found
that 'i1' is

215
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,910
something like 5.14 amperes.

216
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:50,240
And I think I find 'i2' equals
'i3' equals 3.43 amperes.

217
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,785
Three equations with three
unknowns you have to solve.

218
00:11:53,785 --> 00:11:57,010

219
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:01,660
Now you have to know what is
the current through 'iS'.

220
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,030
That, of course, is
'i1' minus 'i3'.

221
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,830
And if this turns to be
positive, turns out then the

222
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,770
current is indeed going up.

223
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,620
And it is indeed going up
because you find that it is

224
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,180
1.71 amperes.

225
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,890
And so the current through that
resistor three is indeed

226
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:23,180
in the upwards direction.
