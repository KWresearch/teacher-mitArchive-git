1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,510

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,850
27-24.

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:18,060
We charge a capacitor 'C', and
we charge it to 15 volts.

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,750
Then we discharge it through
a resistor 'R'.

5
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,400
So here is that capacitor, it's
fully charged, switch

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,470
here, resistor here, 'R', throw
the switch-- at first

7
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,140
there is +15 volts here--

8
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,240
we throw the switch, current
is going to flow until the

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,600
capacitor is completely
discharged.

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,550
Now this 'R' is part
of a voltmeter.

11
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,720
I shall call it 'Rv', and that
is 2.25 times 10 to the sixth

12
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,110
ohms. And what the voltmeter
indicates--

13
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,530
this is really a voltmeter--

14
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,130
is, of course, the product of
the current through the

15
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,990
voltmeter times the resistance
of the voltmeter.

16
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:08,370
So that's what the reading
will show you.

17
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,840
You start throwing the switch.

18
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:10,370
What do you see?

19
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,440
15 volts, of course.

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,260
Now you wait 5 seconds
and what do you see?

21
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,170
You only see 1/3 of 15 volts.

22
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,080
You only see 5 volts.

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,330
At least that's a given.

24
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,630

25
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:35,300
Well, if you look in your book
at page 848 you see in detail

26
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,900
how we set up the differential
equations for this circuit.

27
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,860
It's extremely simple.

28
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,630
And you'll find then that the
current through this circuit,

29
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:51,110
going in this direction, has a
function of time equals 'i0'

30
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:56,490
times 'e' to the ''- t'
divided by 'RC''.

31
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,220
Sometimes 'RC' is called the
discharge time, which is, of

32
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,080
course, a little bit
of a jargon.

33
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,810
Because it takes infinitely long
for the whole thing to be

34
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,690
discharged.

35
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,080
You have to wait for t
infinitely long for the

36
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,600
current to become 0.

37
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,870
Now, the voltmeter reads
'i' times 'R'.

38
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,910
'i' times 'R'.

39
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,140
But since you have the 'R' on
the right side as well as on

40
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,910
the left side, that's fine.

41
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,810
You can ignore that.

42
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,060
What you do know, however, is
that after 5 seconds it over

43
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,320
'i0' is 1/3.

44
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:38,870
So 1/3 equals 'e' to the
''- t' over 'RC'.

45
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,440
't' is 5 seconds over 'RC'.

46
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,250

47
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,350
Well, you know 'R'.

48
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,060
2.25 megaohms. So
out pops 'C'.

49
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:00,670
And I found that 'C' equals
2 microfarads.

50
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:09,260
If you make a curve of the
current as a function of time,

51
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,290
that would look like this.

52
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:15,230
This is the current, this is the
time, you start off with

53
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:22,160
some current 'i0', and it
discharges in exponential

54
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:29,080
fashion, and by the time it is
down to 'i0' over 'e', which

55
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,900
is somewhere here, the
time 't' equals 'RC'.

56
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,470
That's why it's often called the
'RC' time of the circuit.
