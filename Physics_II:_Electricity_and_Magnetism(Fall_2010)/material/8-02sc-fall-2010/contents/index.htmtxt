One frame of an animation showing a magnet levitating below a superconducting
ring. As the magnet falls under gravity, a current is induced in the ring that
generates a magnetic field that pulls the magnet upwards, levitating it below
the ring. (Image courtesy of John Belcher).

***** Course Description *****
This freshman-level course is the second semester of introductory physics. The
focus is on electricity and magnetism, including electric fields, magnetic
fields, electromagnetic forces, conductors and dielectrics, electromagnetic
waves, and the nature of light.
*** Course Format ***
===============================================================================
[Click_to_get_started.]This course has been designed for independent study. It
includes all of the materials you will need to understand the concepts covered
in this subject. The materials in this course include:
    * A complete set of Lecture Videos by renowned MIT Physics Professor Walter
      Lewin
    * A complete set of detailed Course Notes, replacing the need for a
      traditional course textbook
    * A complete set of Class Slides, with overviews and illustrations of the
      concepts and applications of the subject
    * Homework Problems and Concept Questions to gauge your understanding of
      and progress through the materials
    * Homework Help Videos in which Prof. Lewin takes viewers step-by-step
      through solving homework problems
    * Visualizations of electromagnetic phenomena which are normally invisible
      to the human eye
    * An online study group at OpenStudy where you can connect with other
      independent learners
The content has been organized for linear progression through each of the
Course Modules, starting with Electric Fields and concluding with The Nature of
Light. It is a self-study course that you can work through at your own pace.
