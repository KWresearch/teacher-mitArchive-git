Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

***** Prerequisites *****
ESD.934 is a graduate-level course. A background in policy analysis,
microeconomics and/or engineering and science is preferred. Open to advanced
undergraduates with permission of instructor.
***** Description *****
The course presents an in-depth interdisciplinary perspective of electric power
systems, with regulation providing the link among the engineering, economic,
legal and environmental viewpoints. Generation dispatch, demand response,
optimal network flows, risk allocation, reliability of service, renewable
energy sources, ancillary services, tariff design, distributed generation,
rural electrification, environmental impacts and strategic sustainability
issues will be among the topics addressed under both traditional and
competitive regulatory frameworks.
The course will make available the engineering, economic and legal basis to
critically evaluate the regulatory instruments that are used worldwide for
electricity supply activities that are performed as regulated monopolies or
under competitive conditions. Most of these regulatory approaches are also of
application in other industrial sectors.
The knowledge acquired in the course will provide the comprehensive
understanding of electric power systems that will be needed for research in
this field, as well as for future professional activities in the energy sector,
whether in industry, government or consulting.
***** Grading *****
       Grading criteria.
ACTIVITIES           PERCENTAGES
Homework assignments 50%
Term paper           50%
The final grade for the course will be computed based on the take-home
assignments (50%) and a final term paper (50%), including presentation and
discussion. Participation in class (lectures and recitations) will be taken
into account when determining the final grade.
