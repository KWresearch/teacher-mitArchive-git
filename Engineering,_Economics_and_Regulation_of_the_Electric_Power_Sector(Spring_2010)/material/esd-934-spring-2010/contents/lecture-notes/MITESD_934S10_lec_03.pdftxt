Generation technologies

•  Hydro plants
•  with reservoir
•  run-of-the-river
•  pump storage
•  Thermal plants
•  Nuclear
•  Coal, oil
•  Gas
–  simple cycle
–  combined cycle
•  Other plants: wind, thermo solar, photovoltaic, 
fuel cells, biomass, geothermal, wave & tidal 
power, etc.

Why a mix of generation technologies?

•  Economic reasons
–  The uneven demand proﬁle provides 
opportunities for the different technologies, 
since they offer different combinations of 
ﬁxed & variable costs
•  Strategic / political reasons
–  Fuel diversiﬁcation is a reasonable strategy 
•  Environmental reasons
–  Generation technologies have very diverse 
environmental impacts

Load-duration curve

In general terms, the generating 
units in a power system are called 
to operate (are “dispatched”) in 
order of the increasing operating 
costs until all demand is met & 
some units (or part of them) are 
kept on “operating reserve”

Combined-cycle units

Gas turbine development led to combined-
cycle units: ʻsteam and gasʼ. Such units have 
high (electric) efﬁciencies (up to 60%).

Sale of heat less important
Smaller units make on-site electricity 
production competitive

The electricity 
distribution network 

Distribution
•  One can distinguish between 
subtransmission & true distribution 
networks
•  Subtransmission networks cover a region 
& they have a some kind of meshed 
topology. They feed distribution networks & 
some large consumers
•  Distribution networks must reach every 
single end consumer
–  Rural distribution networks have a radial 
topology
–  Urban distribution networks are meshed but 
they are operated radially

Main properties of electric storage technologies

Electricity supply 
comprises many 
activities… 

Supply of electricity
Classiﬁcation of the required activities

11

12

 
Commercialization (retailing, supply (UK))

Diversity of services: 
•  Retailers of captive consumers
•  Retailers of consumers that are qualiﬁed to 
choose supplier
–  and choose supplier
–  but stay with the regulated tariff (if any)
•  Traders
•  Brokers

System Operation

•  Coordination activity at system level: To 
guarantee system security while meeting the 
market requirements
•  System Operator (SO) implements the 
dispatch of generation & determines the 
network operation, subject to prescribed 
technical rules
•  SO applies prescribed criteria for network 
access & informs about estimated access 
conditions in the short, medium & long run

13

14

Market Operation (power exchange, PEX)

•  PEX facilitates transactions among agents in an 
organized market
–  In principle, this is a non regulated activity
•  Typically: management of day ahead transactions
–  Hourly (typically) matching of purchasing & selling 
bids for the next day
•  Also: management of other markets
–  Shorter term: intra-daily markets, regulation market, 
etc. 
–  Longer term: future contracts, forward contracts
•  Economic settlement of transactions

15

16

Service quality 

Different dimensions of quality of service

•  Technical quality of the product
–  Continuity of supply
–  Technical characteristics of the waveform
•  Over-voltages, harmonics, mini-interruptions, 
ﬂicker
•  Commercial quality of service
–  Connection / disconnection time, response to 
queries, metering, general attention to 
customers, other services

Quality of service at delivery

17

18

Quality of service at wholesale level 
•  Metric 1: Non served energy (NSE)
–  Annual non served demand (MWh) in the entire 
system because of service interruptions (longer 
than 1 minute) at wholesale (i.e. transmission 
network) level 
 Typical reference value that has been used in 
centralized generation expansion planning: 1day 
equivalent of non-served demand/10 years 
•  Metric 2: Average interruption time
–  This is the NSE divided by the average power (MW) 
supplied by the system, and it is expressed in 
minutes 
 TIM = 8760 x 60 x NSE / E 
 E = annual supplied system demand (MWh)   
 Typical reference value could be 15 m/year (e.g. 
 Spain) 

 
 

19

Quality of service of the transmission 
network 
•  The unavailability of a network can be measured by the total 
amount of time that its lines, transformers & control 
devices have not been available during the year.  
 Computation of the Unavailability Index (UI) (a component of 
the remuneration of transmission may be related to this index):

ti= Unavailable time for the ith component (line, transformer 
or control device) (hours) 
n= Total number of lines, transformers and control devices in 
the transmission network 
T= Duration of the considered time period (hours) 
PNi= Rated capacity (MW) of the lines, transformers and 
control devices

Environmental 
implications of 
electricity supply & 
consumption 
References: For instance see J.W. Tester et al. “Sustainable 
energy. Choosing among options”, MIT Press, 2005. 

21

Environmental implications

•  No technology is free from environmental impact, 
although the type & extent of the impacts are widely 
different
–  The entire life cycle has to be considered
•  Mining, fuel processing, manufacturing of plant 
components, electricity production, emissions, 
wastes, dismantling
•  E.g., some not well known results
–  Embedded energy content of a PV module 
(polycristalline wafer) takes 2 years of operation to 
recover (much less with the newer thin ﬁlm 
techniques being currently pursued)
–  According to some studies a nuclear plant takes 
5 years to recover the energy spent during 
construction & fuel manufacturing

22

Environmental implications (cont.)

–  All thermal plants (fossil, nuclear, biomass, high 
temperature thermosolar) need some cooling, 
since a large fraction of the primary energy is 
rejected to the environment 
•  From “once-through” cooling to cooling towers & 
dry cooling (expensive & some loss of efﬁciency)
•  Use of the reject heat: cogeneration & 
trigeneration

23

Environmental implications (cont.)

–  Waste
•  Radioactive materials (high, medium, low intensity)
•  Ash & sludge (coal power plants)
•  Dismantling the plant at end of useful life
–  Airborne emissions
•  CO2 (all fossil plants during operation; but the complete 
load cycle should be considered)
•  SO2 (>90% typically captured with scrubbers)waste
•  NOx (depending on the combustion temperature)
•  Particulates (>99% can be captured, although not the 
sub-micron-sized ones)

26

Environmental implications (cont.)

–  Land area requirements, e.g.:
•  Typically 2 km2 for a large fossil plant (plus any mining 
requirements, for coal) vs. 0.2 km2 for natural gas plants or for 
nuclear plants (plus the surrounding “exclusion zone”)
•  Hydropower: E.g. Hoover Dam (1500 MW) inundates 640 km2 
while a high temperature concentrated solar plant in the US 
southwest desert would require ~50 km2 to produce the same 
energy annually. (Source J.W. Tester book, Ch. 13)
•  Wind: ~ 3 to 4 MW/km2
•  High-temperature thermosolar with parabolic through 
systems in a good region (2500 kWh/yr.m2 available solar 
energy): 0,5 km2 of collector surface area for a 100 MWe 
plant operating with 12% solar to electric efﬁciency
•  Fotovoltaic: 5 MW/km2 (non movable panels) for 10 GWh/
(yr. km2) in a good Spanish site

Environmental implications (cont.)

–  Visual impact, noise, environmental degradation, 
hazards for wildlife, health threats
•  The NYMBY effect (beneﬁts typically do not accrue to 
those most disturbed by the plant)
•  Potential incentive mechanisms to reduce opposition
•  We have to make choices!!!

30

31

Environmental implications (cont.)

Case example:
•  In Spain, the power sector is responsible for 
–  90% of SO2 & NOx emissions from large 
combustion facilities (>50 MWt)
–  68% & 23% of the total emissions of SO2 & NOx
–  25% of total CO2 emissions
–  95% of the high level radioactive waste
•  Note that
–  Electricity price does not include most 
environmental costs
–  Economic efﬁciency & sustainability require 
these environmental costs to be internalized

Outline (next session)

•  Background
•  The technological perspective
•  The economic & managerial perspectives
–  Time scales
•  Expansion planning
•  Operation planning
•  Operation
•  Protection & control
–  Economic data & orders of magnitude
