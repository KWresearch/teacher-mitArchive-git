Electricity markets & public 
policy 
A necessary coexistence 

Prof. Ignacio J. Pérez-Arriaga 
 

 

Our energy model is unsustainable 

 The current energy model cannot provide energy 
services that 
 are compatible with the expected growth in population & 
welfare in the medium & long-term, 
 with a reasonably equitable universal access 
 and with a tolerable environmental impact 
 The problems 
 non equitable access 
  tight coupling of economic development & energy demand 
growth 
  very high dependence of fossil fuels 
  key energy resources are limited & geographically 
concentrated

Consider climate change… 

 There is widespread agreement that a 
transition to a future economy with a drastic 
reduction in GHG emissions is needed to 
stabilize GHG concentration at levels such that 
the implications of climate change could be 
kept under “reasonable” limits

But this is an arduous task & it 
will not happen by itself 

 An emission path with good chances of 
meeting the <2ºC target: 
“in order to achieve a stabilization level of 450 ppmv 
CO2 eq, emissions from Annex I Parties would need 
to be between 25 per cent and 40 per cent below 
1990 levels in 2020, and between 80 per cent to 95 
per cent below 1990 levels in 2050.”

Energy policy in a low-carbon 
economy 

 A sustainable economy has to be based on a 
sustainable energy model, where the power sector is 
a key component 
 The current regulatory paradigm of the power sector 
has to be reconsidered in this new context, where 
public energy policy will play a major role

Limitations of energy markets (1 of 2) 

 Advantages of markets are well known 
 Energy markets are successful if structure is right 
& there are no interferences 
 although they are complex & may go wrong in 
many ways 
 But there are limitations 
 Network activities are natural monopolies 
 (perhaps) Adequate margin of installed generation 
supply may require some regulatory intervention 

7 

Limitations of energy markets (2 of 2) 
 … and more limitations (of interest here) 
 Energy markets may ignore sustainability concerns 
 long-term availability of present energy sources 
 energy dependence / diversification of fuels 
 need to promote technologies that are suitable for long-term 
sustainability objectives 
 since energy prices fail to fully internalize these concerns. 
Why? 
 Technical /practical difficulties in implementation 
 high energy prices are not politically acceptable 
 lack of long-term regulatory commitment 
Need to provide energy markets with some long-
term vision

What could (but maybe should not) be 
regulated? 
 Support schemes for renewable energy penetration & 
cleaner fossil technologies 
 Targets for energy efficiency & savings & how to 
achieve them 
 Support schemes to improve the security of electricity & 
gas supply 
 Development of gas & electricity network infrastructures 
 Priorities & resources for energy R&D    
 Targets for carbon allowance emissions 
 Implementation guidelines resulting from the debate on 
future nuclear investments 

9 

The questions to be addressed 

 In the context that can be anticipated of strong 
sustainability & security oriented policy measures 
1.  How to improve / redesign market 
regulation to facilitate that these policies 
reach their objectives efficiently? 
2.  How to make these policy measures 
compatible with the functioning of 
electricity markets?  

See the special issue of The Energy Journal “The future of electricity: Papers in 
honor of David Newbery”, 2008, for a detailed elaboration on these issues 

10

Some premises (1 of 3) 

 Creating well functioning competitive wholesale & 
retail markets for electricity is very challenging, both 
technically & politically, & cannot be applied anywhere 
 Where properly implemented, wholesale markets have led to 
improved performance & have mobilized significant 
investments 
 Sound incentive-based regulation of distribution companies 
has reduced costs without impairing quality of service 
 Despite some failures & implementation difficulties, the 
general trend in most liberalized power sectors is to proceed 
with the process of reforms 

11 

Some premises (2 of 3) 

 There is a serious (& justified) global concern about 
climate change & this will affect energy policy & 
power sector investments profoundly  intense 
political oversight & interference is anticipated 
 Security & sustainability will have at least the 
same priority as efficiency in the regulatory design 
 New & emerging clean technologies will be crucial 
in attaining a sustainable power system model, but 
their development & commercial deployment will 
typically need regulatory support  

12 

6 

Some premises (3 of 3) 

 It is anticipated a large penetration of renewable &/
or intermittent &/or distributed generation in 
many power systems 
 The availability of communication & control 
technologies plus current trends in regulation & 
consumer behavior signal a strong future active 
demand response 
 Political developments, economic rationality & 
network reinforcements lead to an integration of 
existing power systems & markets into larger 
entities

The regulatory context for 
clean energy 

7 

Advancing the conclusion 

“A compelling vision, backed up by precise, simple, 
clear policy, needs to be implemented if larger 
institutions and investors are to create the 
argument internally that a greater proportion of 
the balance sheet needs to be available for 
sustainable energy” 

Source: Chatham House, “Unlocking finance for clean energy”, 2009, 
www.chathamhouse.org.uk 

An adequate regulatory context for 
clean energy 

 For the most part the market for clean 
energy is policy-driven (for a good reason) 
 In a policy-driven market regulation itself 
is a risk 
 Therefore, to unlock finance for clean energy 
there is a need for “investment grade” 
policy 

16 

8 

Policy needs to be “loud, long & legal” 

 Loud 
 Policy instruments make a difference, so that 
investments in clean energy become commercially 
attractive 
 Long 
 Policy instruments are sustained for a period that is 
consistent with the financial characteristics of the project 
 Legal 
 Policy instruments are based on a clear, stable & well-
established regulatory framework 

Based on “Unlocking finance for clean energy”, www.chathamhouse.org.uk, 2009 

Key features of “investment grade” 
energy policy 

  “Clear, unambiguous policy objectives, with clear enforcement 
provisions 
  Policy and regulation streamlined across all factors within the 
boundary of the deal: from planning approval to delivery 
  Carefully designed incentive or support mechanisms to achieve 
targets or objectives 
  Policy stability across a project-relevant duration 
  Simplicity: to reduce complexity and variables that might add risk 
  Near-term attention to infrastructure – the planning, integration and 
regulatory requirements – to ensure the overall system is optimized 
for significant uptake of RE, and demand-side options”

More on a sound clean energy policy 

 Besides a sound regulatory support scheme, any massive 
deployment of a clean technology requires also attention 
to  
 development of the required underlying 
infrastructure (connection to electricity networks, plugs 
for PHEVs, feedstock for biomass plants, etc.) 
 including any authorization procedures, among other 
surrounding factors that need to be solved for the 
support scheme to be efective 

There are some reasons for concern 

 “Clean energy” technologies are very diverse 
(renewables of different types, energy saving & efficiency, smart 
grids as an enabler, CCS, nuclear?) 
 Designing a comprehensive energy strategy is more complex 
than just choosing the least cost solution  policies may 
shift 
 e.g., presently renewables are not the least expensive option to 
mitigate climate change, but they will be indispensable in the long 
run and have also side benefits (& inconveniences) at local level: 
How stable the support will be? 
 regulatory instruments should adapt to 
technological changes (not the same risk when investing in 
mature vs. emergent technologies)  

10 

Question #1: 
How to improve /redesign 
market regulation to facilitate 
the implementation of 
sustainable policies? 

A tentative list of regulatory 
challenges (1 of 7) 
 The need for adequate transmission & 
distribution networks 
 Establish proper remuneration of distribution networks 
with distributed generation & active demand response 
 Design, operation & control of distribution networks have to be 
adapted & costs will increase  need for new network models & 
regulatory schemes (see detail in next slide) 
 Attain adequate investment levels in transmission 
networks with much intermittent/renewable generation 
 The existing network (e.g. in the US & EU) lacks adequate 
interconnection capacity among regions, a comprehensive 
approach to coordinated transmission expansion & the institutional 
capability for an effective implementation 

11 

Detail 
Ideas for a regulatory response 
 Refine the models of remuneration of distribution 
networks, so that the extra costs/benefits of 
accommodating DG & efficiency measures are recognized & 
negative incentives are minimized 
 Find instruments to incorporate deployment of effective 
innovative technologies in the remuneration schemes  
 Transmission capacity expansion must be based on 
comprehensive planning studies & responsibilities for 
implementation should be clearly assigned  
 Pricing & remuneration of transmission should be 
transparent, low risk & convey efficient locational signals 

23 

A tentative list of regulatory 
challenges (2 of 7) 
 Efficient locational signals & constraints management 
  Locational marginal pricing (nodal energy pricing) is the 
preferred solution, although it will find political resistance in 
the EU (not yet implemented in established markets; winners & losers)  
  Locational transmission network charges (very much talked about, 
but only implemented in few power systems) 
 Geographical expanse ➔ markets integration (needed 
to mitigate market power & to dilute generation intermittency) 
 The inter RTO seamless problem (US) 
 Not attempted seriously yet 
 The regional initiatives (EU) 
 Still struggling at regional level 

12 

A tentative list of regulatory 
challenges (3 of 7) 
 Changes in the generation technology mix induced 
by renewable / intermittent / distributed generation 
  Less “residual demand” / some impact on base-load 
technologies / more back-up capacity to provide operating 
reserves in the mix 
 Regulatory instruments to achieve generation investment 
adequacy 
 The case for support of peaking units (although all generation units 
are affected) becomes more apparent 
 A large variety of regulatory schemes is presently used or under 
consideration 

25 

A tentative list of regulatory 
challenges (4 of 7) 
 Changes in system operation with strong presence 
of renewable / intermittent / distributed generation & 
active demand response 
 Present system operation is not adequate to deal with 
really large volumes of intermittent generation, integration 
of demand response & seamless coordinated congestion 
network management in large interconnected power 
systems  new paradigms in system operation 
 Aggregators of active demand, micro-generation (including PHEVs) 
& distributed storage 
 New approaches & flexibility in provision of ancillary services 
 Perhaps security-driven hydro generation management 

26 

13 

A tentative list of regulatory 
challenges (5 of 7) 
 Active demand response: taking advantage of it 
& making it possible 
 Efficient deployment of advanced metering, real-time 
tariffs & behind-the-meter load management 
 Meeting the objectives of energy efficiency & savings  
Competitive & focused retail companies (energy service 
providers)  adequate design of default tariffs, 
unbundling, compatibility standards, design of smart grids 
 Additional challenges: electrification of mobility 
 Efficient integration of active demand response is a major 
component in the new paradigm for system operation 

Detail 
Ideas for a regulatory response 
 Technologies & economic signals resulting in energy 
conservation & efficiency (ECE) improvements from 
the consumers’ side typically lead to reductions in 
the regulated revenue of distributors & 
uncompensated demand destruction for retailers 
 As with DG penetration, these measures may not be 
welcomed by distributors & retailers, unless 
  the efficiency gains are shared with distributors & retailers 
  the remuneration of the distribution activity is more 
precisely computed & made less dependent on the 
simplistic “distributed energy” metric  

28 

14 

A tentative list of regulatory 
challenges (6 of 7) 
 Other obstacles or barriers that markets do not solve 
by themselves (or fast enough) without external 
intervention 
 Increment the regional / spatial dimension 
 Fix market structural problems (vertical integration, 
excessive concentration) 
 Political resistance to accept needed regulatory changes 

29 

A tentative list of regulatory 
challenges (7 of 7) 
 Lack of access to electricity in developing countries 
(DCs) is a key component of the lack of sustainability of 
the present energy model 
 Rural electrification  
 Has to be explicitly considered an energy policy in DCs 
 Has always needed support schemes 
 Specific financial & organizational models are needed to 
attract private investment 
 Regarding CC a key issue is to promote large-scale 
grid-connected renewable deployment 
 Issues: new hydro developments, adapt support schemes, 
financing 

30 

15 

Question #2: 
How to make markets & 
public energy policies 
compatible? 

How much regulation does 
liberalization need? 

  Proper market design and policy enforcement for the 
competitive part of the system (competition policy) 
  Proper regulatory mechanism design and policy enforcement 
for the natural monopoly part of the system (regulatory 
policy) 
  Proper market arrangements and policy design for the 
handling of environmental effects of electricity and gas 
production and use (environmental policy) 
  Market arrangements and policy design for securing security 
of supply/resource adequacy (public goods aspects) 
  Proper overall design and policy enforcement  

16 

First, indicative planning 

 What is intended to accomplish? (national & 
supranational energy policies require long-term analysis with 
sustainability criteria)  indicative planning (IP) 
 The IP procedure is meant to characterize meaningful 
energy development paths that meet any prescribed high 
level (sustainability & others) targets, in order to facilitate 
political decisions 
 Note that, once one path is chosen, IP 
 is more than just prospective analysis (find what could happen)  
 has normative character (identify what has to be done to make 
sure that a future with some desirable features happens) 

33 

A tentative list of regulatory 
challenges (1 of 4) 
 Choice of instruments to develop & deploy clean 
technologies (electricity generation & energy 
efficiency & conservation, ECE) to meet IP targets 
 Use market prices (of energy, emissions, green or white 
certificates) with as much internalization as politically 
possible 
 BUT while full internalization of sustainability implications 
is not achieved  use additional regulatory 
instruments (quotas, standards, incentives, cross-cutting 
policies) while trying to minimize market distortion 

34 

17 

A tentative list of regulatory 
challenges (2 of 4) 
 Choice of instruments to make possible a clean 
technology mix in electricity generation 
 Nuclear: if politically acceptable, it might need some 
regulatory commitment to reduce financial risks 
 Clean coal (CCS): presently only viable with regulatory 
support (until sufficiently high & stable CO2 prices exist) 
 Renewables: same; support scheme should depend on 
level of maturity of technology, cost & rules for integration 
in the market (which affect the economic viability of other plants) 
 Peaking plants: economic viability strongly depends on 
regulation of security of supply & intermittent generation 
 Reduced, but not negligible, space for the market 

35 

A tentative list of regulatory 
challenges (3 of 4) 
 Choice of instruments to make energy efficiency & 
conservation (EEC) (technology with largest potential & 
most cost-effective) possible at a required level 
 Here energy prices, even with full internalization, might not 
be sufficient to achieve the desired consumer response (lack 
of information, high consumers’ discount rates, uncertainty in 
investments’ results, weak incentives, principal-agent problem, rebound 
effect) use additional instruments & target energy savings 
rather than efficiency, plus information 
 Make use of standards or of other measures also directly seeking a 
net reduction in energy consumption (still, danger of free riding, 
inefficiency) 
 It is OK to use a mix of regulatory instruments in this “second-best” 
36 
world 

18 

A tentative list of regulatory 
challenges (4 of 4) 
 Other regulatory concerns 
 Transitory arrangements (windfall profits) 
 Windfall profits: consumers must be protected in different ways; 
this is a side effect of the application of CC-related instruments 
 Regulatory stability & predictability 
 Role of independent regulators: These issues should be 
explicitly included within the responsibilities of energy 
regulatory agencies 
 Governments should set the high level targets & 
approve an “indicative” sustainable plan 
 Regulators should design the regulatory instruments to 
make this possible within a market environment
