The question
•  How can it be possible to meet the 
demand at any time efﬁciently and 
reliably, for an inﬁnite time horizon and 
under uncertainty?
The answer: Use a temporal hierarchy of 
decisions
–  Decision functions hierarchically chained
–  Each function optimizes its own decisions 
subject to
•  Its own constraints
•  Constraints that are imposed from “upstream”

Regulatory paradigms

•  Two regulatory paradigms
–  Centralized – Traditional, regulated 
monopolies
–  Decentralized – De-regulated, market-
oriented
•  Both regulatory approaches seek to 
achieve the same basic objective
–  in theory they only condition the decision-
making process, but not the outcome
–  in practice they condition the outcome of 
planning and operation

Traditional regulation –  context
•  Monopolies with geographic franchises
•  Vertically integrated businesses
•  Centralized operation and expansion
–  Cost minimization
•  Cost of service-based remuneration
–  Fixed investment costs (plant, line 
construction...)  €/MW
–  Variable operating costs (fuel consumption, 
maintenance, ...) €/MWh
•  Tariff-based prices for users; utilities subject 
to mandatory supply obligations
•  Minimum (cheap) risk assumed by 
consumers

Liberalized regulation - context
•  De-regulate activities
–  Freedom to invest and operate
•  Attract private, international investment
•  Allow new and more efﬁcient initiatives
–  Decentralization
–  Introduce competition to
•  Lower costs
•  Encourage demand-side participation
•  Unbundle business activities
–  Competitive: generation and retailing
–  Natural monopolies: transmission and 
distribution

Liberalized regulation - context
•  Market mechanisms  govern generation 
investment and operating decisions
–  supply-demand balance sets prices & 
amounts
•  Wholesale Market
–  remuneration based on the competitive sale 
of the “electricity product”  €/MWh
•  Short-term sales (pool – balancing markets)
•  Long-term sales (OTC contracts)
–  higher (expensive) risk, assumed by 
investors
–  maximized individual proﬁt and market 
balance

Liberalized regulation - context

•  Market mechanisms govern power 
retailing decisions
–  Distinction between the “wire” business 
(likened to roads) and the business of 
selling power (likened to tomatoes), 
distributed across wires
–  Notion of customer
–  Absence of tariffs
–  Retailing valued for the added value 
offered to customers

Generation expansion planning 
(in a liberalized regulatory framework)

•  Every agent decides by itself
•  It is a typical investment planning decision 
under uncertainty
– Key point is the evaluation of future 
market behavior
•  market price
•  new investments of competitors
•  fuel prices
•  demand growth

26

Network expansion planning 
(in a liberalized regulatory framework)
•  No radical changes with traditional regulation
•  Transmission
–  Generation expansion is unknown  uncertainty
–  Most frequent: centralized planning under 
supervision of regulator and cost-of-service 
remuneration
•  Distribution
–  Distributor decides network expansion in its 
franchised territory
–  Distributor is subject to quality of service conditions
–  Diverse remuneration schemes are possible

Operation planing (Medium term):  
 (in a liberalized regulatory framework)
•  Medium term economic forecasts 
•  Strategies for proﬁt maximization
–  Contracts, maintenance of facilities, reservoir 
management
–  Guidelines for preparation of bids: Limited energy 
plants
•  The economic value of water
•  New issues in power system models
–  Strategic behavior of each ﬁrm, impact of 
stranded cost recovery on market strategies, 
subsidies or domestic fuel quotas, market price 
caps, etc.

Operation planning (Short term)  
 (in a liberalized regulatory framework)

•  Preparation of bids for the daily market
–  Selling & purchasing bids are grouped into 
supply & demand curves and matched using 
some kind of algorithm to yield the market 
marginal price
•  Issues
–  Internalization of strictly non variable costs
–  Inter-temporal couplings
–  Estimation of the strategic behavior of 
competitors

31

Real time operation: 
Centralized environment

Real time operation 
 (in a liberalized regulatory framework)

•  Most security / monitoring activities are the 
same as in the centralized framework
•  Changes in the new open market 
environment
–  Existence of short-term markets
•  Intra-daily markets
•  Regulation markets
–  Unbundled &/or market-oriented ancillary 
services

Ancillary services 

33

34

Ancillary services  
Deﬁnition
•  Activities (may be associated to generation, 
transmission or distribution) that are  
needed to guarantee security, quality & 
efﬁciency in electricity supply 
•  Main ancillary services
–  Load-frequency control
•  Primary regulation
•  Secundary reserves
•  Tertiary reserves
–  Voltage control
–  System restoration
•  Black start capability

Ancillary services 
Traditional & market oriented approaches
•  Tradicional regulation: Fully integrated in the 
generation or transmission activity
•  Market oriented regulation: Unbundled & with 
own scheme (some times market-oriented) of 
provision & remuneration
–  Provision of ancillary services usually results in 
extra costs for the suppliers & an increase in 
the expected price of energy
•  SO establishes required volume of service

Load frequency control (LFC)
Primary control

• Primary control
– Makes use of the governor in the generator
• Time constant of about 1 second
– Objective: to prevent frequency deviations
– Each machine has a speciﬁc response to 
frequency deviations
– The primary control cannot completely recover 
the nominal frequency value or eliminate errors 
in scheduled power exchanges

Load frequency control (LFC) 
Secundary & tertiary controls
•  Secundary control
–  This is the Automatic Generation Control, AGC
•  Time response ~ 1 minute 
–  Restores frequency & power exchanges to 
preset values
•  It cancels the Area Control Error ACE, which 
combines both objectives
•  Tertiary control
–  This is an economic generation dispatch 
that recomputes the set points of generators & 
restores secundary reserves
•  Time response ~15 minutes

39

Secondary LFC 
Computation of the area control error (ACE) 

Voltage (reactive power) control

•  Primary control
–  Voltage regulator in the generating machine
•  Time response of less than 1 second (depending on 
the type of excitation system: DC, AC, static)
–  It keeps a constant voltage in the generatorʼs 
output
•  Secundary & tertiary controls (less structured than 
for AGC)
–  Objectives
•  Maintain voltage at preset values at some chosen 
nodes
•  Keep the balance in reactive power allocation 
•  Minimize losses
–  Resources
•  Generators, Transformer taps , Capacitors, SVCʼs

41

Security analysis and 
control 

43

Major threats to the power system
•  Lack of generation output to meet demand
–  Either at global system level or locally (because of 
network constraints)
•  Lack of operating generation reserves to respond 
to plausible changes in demand or production
•  Overload of network components
•  Violation of voltage limits
•  Loss of (or proximity to loose) system stability 
conditions
–  transient (large scale) instability
–  long-term (frequency response) instability
–  oscillatory (low frequency) instability
–  voltage collapse

46
45

Security functions

•  State estimation: Assign best possible 
values to the state variables of the power 
system from the available measurements
•  Contingency analysis: Evaluation of 
the impact on the system (line overloads, 
voltages out of range, loss of stability, etc) 
of potential failures of components
–  generators
–  lines
–  combined failures

47

Power Grid Evolution

•  Phase I: Network analyzer (Pre 1950)
•  Phase II: Digital computer (1950+)
•  Phase III: Control ,system theory, 
optimization  impact (1970+)
•  Phase IV: Environmental concerns, 
HVDC,FACTS + markets (1990+)
•  Phase V: advanced communication, 
sensors, active demand response, 
distributed generation (2010+)

Protections
•  Every piece of equipment is protected against 
faults, short-circuits in particular
–  Contact (an electric arc, usually) between two 
conductors or between a conductor & ground
•  Why? Electric, mechanic, atmospheric or human
•  Very large currents are produced  thermal 
problems &/or mechanical stresses
•  It is necessary to detect & eliminate the fault 
very quickly & then to isolate the faulted 
element so that it can be repaired
•  Relays detect, power breakers eliminate the fault & 
disconnect switches isolate the faulted element

49

Types of Protection relays

•  Most common types of protection relays
–  Overcurrent relay
–  Directional overcurrent relay
•  for selectivity

–  Distance relay
•  Response time proportional to distance to the fault
–  Overvoltage / undervoltage relays
–  Differential relay
•  Comparison of two theoretically equal magnitudes
•  Time delay relays
–  Selectivity may also be attained by timing relays

Protection for people

•  Earthing system
–  Electrical  facility  designed  so  that,  at  any 
accessible  point,  people  would  be  subject  at 
most  to  non-hazardous  pass  and  contact 
voltage. 
•  Pass voltage 
–  Voltage  between  two  points  on  the  ground,  1 
metre from one another. 
•  Contact voltage 
–  Voltage  between  an  accessible  conductor  and 
a point on the ground 1 metre away
