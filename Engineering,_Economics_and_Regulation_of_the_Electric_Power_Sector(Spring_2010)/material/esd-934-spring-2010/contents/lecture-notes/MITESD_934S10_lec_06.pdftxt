What is distribution? (1) 

 Distribution is the transfer of electricity 
between 
 connection points with the transmission 
network 
 end consumers 
 local generation 
 other distribution networks

What is distribution? (2) 

 Distribution is a network activity 
 network expansion planning 
 line construction 
 maintenance scheduling 
 maintenance work 
 network operation 
 Retailing (commercialization, supply) is a different 
activity

Regulatory characterization of 
the distribution activity 
 Natural monopoly that must be regulated 
 Revenues, Quality of service, Access, Obligation of supply, 
Territorial franchise, Limited competition? 
 A small (typically) risk business 
 Distribution must be regulated separately from 
transmission 
 less influence on the wholesale market 
 large generators do not “use” it 
 But, with distributed generation, some of these differences 
become blurred; the remaining significant differences are 
 large number of facilities prevents individualized treatment 
 direct effect on quality of service

Major topics in distribution 
regulation 
 Investment, very much related to quality of 
service & also to network losses 
 Pricing 
 Access 
 The increased presence of distributed generation & 
demand response is forcing to reconsider many 
aspects of distribution regulation  

8 

4 

Investment 
The objective 

 Objective: Optimal trade-off between cost 
(investment, operation) and quality of service & 
losses, while allowing new developments in demand 
response & distributed generation 
 Mandatory planning is unfeasible  regulation must 
be based on global performance 
 The remuneration scheme must provide incentives 
so that the regulatory objective is achieved 

9 

Access 
The objective 

Objective: 
 To establish the rules of use of the 
distribution network so that 
 no agent (demand or generation)is discriminated 
 there is no abuse of the monopolistic power of the 
distributor 
 The network can be safely operated 
 To charge adequately for the facilities to 
connect to the network 

10 

5 

Pricing 
The objective 
 Objective: To allocate the global remuneration 
of the distribution network to the individual users 
 Distribution charges are a component of 
 the “integral” tariff (for non-qualified consumers) 
 the “access” tariff (for qualified consumers) 
 Any charges to connected generators 
 Distribution charges should 
 be cost reflective 
 completely recover the network costs 

11 

Content of licenses (it could be also 
specified in general secundary regulation) 

 Conditions that may be associated to the license (i.e. 
regulated items) 
 Duration, conditions for renovation / loss 
 Geographical franchise 
 Obligation of supply 
 connection, continuity, quality of voltage 
 Regulated remuneration 
 Access conditions 
 Access & connection charges

Price control of regulated 
activities (*) 
 Objectives (when determining the remuneration) 
 financial sustainability of the regulated 
company 
 productive efficiency: service is produced as 
cheaply as possible , subject to minimum quality 
requirements  apply the right incentives 
 There are other objectives, such as equity (non 
discrimination) or allocation efficiency, that are only of 
interest when designing tariffs for the end-consumers 

* Some parts of this section are based on “Resetting price controls for privatized utilities”, 
R. Green, M. Rodríguez Pardina; The World Bank, 1999.

The search for a sound “incentive 
regulation” 
 Any regulatory scheme implies incentives for 
the regulated firm 
 Cost-of-service regulation 
 The Averch-Johnson effect 
 Lack of interest in efficiency gains 
 Cost-of-service based on standard costs (as in the 
Spanish MLE) or some other scheme that ignores the 
actual costs & performance of the firm 
 Strong stimulus to improvements of efficiency, but no 
benefit for consumers & poor quality of service 
 Example: Free electricity to deprived neighbourhoods in the 
Dominican Republic 
15 

What is usually meant by  
“incentive regulation”? 
 Incentive regulation instruments explicitly acknowledge 
 the viability of the regulated firm (the “budget constraint”)  
 the objective of promoting production efficiency while 
preserving quality of service, for the ultimate benefit of 
consumers 
 the uncertainty of the regulator regarding the expected costs 
of the firm & the possible actions to reduce this information 
disadvantage (the “adverse selection“ problem) 
 the need to encourage managerial effort of the firm by 
allowing it to capture rents that cannot be clawed back (the 
“moral hazard” problem)

Price control of regulated activities 
Alternative approaches 
1  Cost-of-service regulation 
2  RPI-X or Price control every N years (developed 
here in more detail) with price or revenue cap 
 with or without profit sharing 
 different techniques of cost estimation 
 estimation of cost-of-service 
 reference models 
 benchmarking 
3  Yardstick competition 
4  Light handed regulation

1. Cost-of-service regulation (1) 
 It has been the dominant method of 
regulation for many years 
 The  regulated  company  is  allowed  to  charge 
prices  that  would  cover  its  operating  costs 
and  provide  a  fair  rate  of  return  on  its 
investment  
  allowed  revenue  =  allowed  operating  expenses  + 
+allowed  rate  of  return  x  allowed  investment  (rate 
base) + depreciation 
 It is meant to recover actual incurred costs  allow 
for deviations of reality with respect to predictions 

19 

1. Cost-of-service regulation (2) 
 Advantages 
 in principle the company recovers its costs 
 cost of capital should be low (low risk) 
 may result in optimal investment levels & quality 
of service (caution: trend to over-invest if rate of return 
is generous (Averch-Johnson effect)) 
 Disadvantages 
 no incentives to keep costs down 
 “prudential reviews” & “regulatory lags” (risk of 
no cost recovery) 
 regulatory lags incentivate cost reduction &, when 
formalized, lead to RPI-X regulation 

20 

10 

2. RPI-X regulation (1) 
 A  formalized  regulatory  lag  between  price  reviews 
gives  companies  an  incentive  to  operate  efficiently  in 
the interval between reviews 
 “Revenue  cap”,  also  called  revenue-yield  control:  the 
trajectory  of  maximum  revenues  of 
the  company 
is 
established for the review period 
 “Price cap”: the company is required to keep the increase in 
a weighted average of its prices to less than the increase in a 
specified price index, less X per cent.  

21 

22 

11 

2. RPI-X regulation (2) 

 Most price controls are scheduled  to  last  for 4 
or 5 years   
 any  reduction  in  costs  cannot  be  passed  through 
into the price control until the next review 
 stronger incentives to reduce costs (but less cost reduction 
to consumers) if the revised prices move smoothly from 
the present level to the new target (instead of adjusting 
them directly to the estimated costs of the company: one-off 
reductions) 

23 

2. RPI-X regulation (3) 
 Different alternatives are open 
 Regarding the adopted technique to estimate the 
efficient costs for the review period 
 Benchmarking, Reference models, Average incremental 
cost (some of these techniques are described in detail later) 
 Leaving the possibility of sharing benefits or 
losses with customers (“profit sharing”) 
 Use a “cost pass-through term” if there are 
significant costs that are beyond the firm’s control 
 RPI-X+Y 
 Much is left to the regulator’s perception 

24 

12 

3. Yardstick competition 

 Within a group of comparable firms the price that 
each one is allowed to charge is based on the costs 
of the rest of the group 
 Sophisticated application requires a large data 
base of costs and relevant characteristics of 
comparable firms 
 Then the adequate remuneration of any company is 
obtained from the existing data by statistical means 
 Provides a strong incentive to reduce costs, since 
the method is exogenous to own costs 

25 

4. Light-handed regulation 

 The utilities themselves determine non-
discriminatory charges for their customers 

 The regulator supervises the charges and may 
impose mandatory changes

RPI-X regulation 
The two major versions 
 Like  rate  of  return  regulation,  but  with  a  formalized 
regulatory  lag  to  give  companies  an  incentive  to 
operate efficiently in the interval between reviews 
 “Price cap”: the company  is required to keep the  increase 
in a weighted average of its prices to less than the increase 
in a specified price index, less X per cent  
 “Revenue  cap”:  the  total  regulated  revenue  of  the 
company  is  required  to  evolve  in  time  as  the  increase  in  a 
specified price index, less X per cent  

29 

RPI-X regulation 
Price cap control (1) 
 The firm is required to increase the weighted average 
of its prices in year t by less than the annual increase 
in the retail price index RPIt less the desired tightening 
X % in the price control 

 The regulator must determine the weights to be used 
in the formula (efficiency  proportional to the quantities 
that would be sold at efficient prices) 
 Under some regulations the regulator determines the 
price cap & also the prices complying with it 
30 

15 

RPI-X regulation 
Price cap control (2) 

 The company just has to send a statement to the 
regulator showing that the proposed price increases 
comply with the formula  simplicity 
 But there is some room for gaming in the estimation of 
the volumes of consumption under each price 
 The formula must allow the company to introduce 
new prices  flexibility 
 There is a strong incentive for the firm to encourage 
an increase of the volume of consumption, once the 
prices have been set  preferably use revenue cap 
control instead 

RPI-X regulation 
Revenue cap control (1) 
 The basic control formula for the total revenue of 
the firm is (all amounts in t): 
Total regulated revenue (t+1) = 
= Total regulated revenue (t) x (1+RPI-X) x 

31 

32 

16 

RPI-X regulation 
Revenue cap control (1) 
 The basic control formula for the total revenue of 
the firm is (all amounts in t): 
Total regulated revenue (t+1) = 
= Total regulated revenue (t) x (1+RPI-X) x 
x (1 + (cid:1028)k ((cid:1014)revenue driver k x weighing factor k)) 
where 
  a typical revenue driver is the total volume (physical, not monetary) of 
sales 
  (cid:1014)revenue driver k is the deviation with respect to the estimate of 
change of revenue driver k that has been already included in the cost 
estimate for the entire price control period 
  Then (cid:1014)revenue driver k = 0 if the value of the revenue driver k 
during the price control period has been estimated correctly 

33 

RPI-X regulation 
Revenue cap control (2) 

 In a possible implementation, the firm is free 
to choose any tariffs, as long as its overall 
revenue stays within the level specified by the 
control (although frequently the regulator also 
establishes the tariffs complying with the revenue 
cap) 

34 

17 

RPI-X regulation 
Revenue cap control (3) 
 Advantages 
 With revenue cap it is possible to adjust X so that the 
net present value of the revenues and the costs over 
the price control period are equal. (This is the key feature of 
the RPI-X method for price control) 
 Once the prices have been set, the firm would also 
appear to have an incentive to increase its volume of 
sales, but, if deviations are applied on the next year to 
comply with the revenue cap formula & if the weighing 
factors are correctly set, the firm is neutral with respect 
to small deviations in the estimation of the revenue 
drivers (including the volume of sales) 

35 

RPI-X regulation 
Duration of the control 

 4 or 5 years strikes a good balance between 
incentives to reduce costs (productive efficiency) & the 
risk that prices will diverge much from costs 
(allocative efficiency & sustainability) but may be too 
short to incentivate innovation 
 The price control may include a “reopener”, i.e. a 
provision to start the price control review process 
before the due date in the event that any pre 
specified significant changes with respect to the 
initial conditions might happen  

36 

18 

A variation on RPI-X 
Profit-sharing regulation 
 Idea: share the cost reductions with consumers 
more rapidly (i.e. between price reviews) 
 regulator monitors the cost evolution  if it is 
much lower (higher) than initially estimated, the 
prices are reduced (increased) to absorb part of the 
saving (cost augmentation). It could be used as a 
refinement to RPI-X 
 cumbersome to implement 
 incentives to reduce costs are weakened 
 variant: firm voluntarily reduces prices and the lost 
revenue is added to the next period’s revenue to smooth 
out the price transition

Elements of price control 
Present value calculations 
 An annual interest rate of r % results in an annual 
discount factor d = 1/(1+r) in per unit, since an 
amount A at the beginning of the year is equivalent 
to A.(1+r) at the end of the year 
  Example: A permanent (i.e., for ever) revenue of €1 million 
received at the beginning of every year, discounted at an 
annual rate d = 0.1, is worth €10 million 
 present value of revenue (assumed accrued at beginning 
of the year) during 1st year is €1 million, €0.9 during 2nd 
year, €0.81 during 3rd year 
 present value of first 5 years is €4.1 million 
 present value of second 5 years is €2.4 million 

39 

Present value calculations 
Matching costs & revenues 

 Present value calculation is used to determine 
the amount of revenue required to cover the 
firm’s predicted costs (including a fair return on 
its assets) 
 this is an economic & not a financial approach 
to cash flow analysis  the regulator might want 
to check that no excessive borrowing (which could 
deteriorate the debt/capital ratio) is needed to spend 
on new investment 

40 

20 

Present value calculations 
The cost based approach 
 For each year: 
Required revenue (RR)=  
 = Operating costs (OC) + Rate of return (r) x Opening 
assets (A) + Depreciation (D) 
 Assume that all the costs & revenues for a year accrue 
at the end of that year  all actual quantities have to 
be discounted to the beginning of the year by applying 
the discount factor d 
d = 1/(1+r) 
 The asset base has to be updated every year to take 
account of depreciation & investment during the 
preceding year 

41 

Net present value of estimated incurred costs (2 year example) 

Net present value of the estimated incurred costs:  
63.636 + 57.025 = 120.661 

21 

Present value calculations 
Calculation of X & the revenue cap 
 TCNPV is the net present value (NPV) of the estimated 
total incurred cost at the initial year t of the 4 year 
price control period 
 Revenue cap trajectory & calculation of X: Match the 
NPV of costs & revenues for the control period 
TCNPV = R(t).d + R(t).(RPI-X).d2 + R(t).(RPI-
X)2.d3 + + R(t).(RPI-X)3.d4  
 NOTE (key issue): The effect of the expected change in the 
cost drivers (such as the supplied demand) is already 
included in TCNPV 

43 

The myth of the efficiency factor X 

 Myth: “The X-factor is intended to capture the 
difference between the operator and the average firm in 
the economy with respect to inflation in input prices and 
changes in productivity”  (The Body of Knowledge on Utility 
Regulation, http://www.regulationbodyofknowledge.org) 
 Alternative view: Once all the future costs of the 
firm for the control period have been somehow 
estimated, the value of X must be such that the net 
present value of the stream of estimated costs and 
revenues for the entire control period are equal 

44 

22 

Present value calculations 
Regulatory issues (1) 

 Note that the regulator may redistribute the 
revenue over time, while maintaining its 
present value 
 it is advisable to set a smooth path of prices 
based on the total required revenues during the 
whole period than to match revenues & costs at 
each subperiod, at the cost of significant 
variations in prices 

45 

Present value calculations 
Regulatory issues (2) 

(continuation) 
 Incentives to cost reduction are stronger if the 
price control moves smoothly between the 
present level of revenues and the level desired in 
the final year 
 If divergence between costs and revenues at the 
end of a control period is large, the control should 
start with a one-off change in revenues & a value 
of X designed to ensure that the firm receives its 
revenue requirement over the control period as a 
whole 
46 

23 

Elements of price control 
Operating costs 

 An estimate of Operating costs is needed in 
the revenue calculation 
 The starting point is the business plan 
submitted by the company 
 current operating costs & projections for the 
future 
 broken down by category: customer group, 
activity (e.g. maintenance, infrastructure, etc) & 
category (e.g. labor, materials, rent, etc)  

47 

Operating costs 
Regulatory treatment 

1  Ongoing uncontrollable costs (e.g. costs of capital) 
 do not try to apply incentives 
 just estimate them & include them 
2  Ongoing controllable costs (e.g. O&M costs) 
 Objective: set a feasible target, so 
 there is an incentive to reduce costs 
 sustainability is preserved 
 Standards based on efficient firms (benchmarking) 
is one possibility 

48 

24 

Operating costs 
Regulatory treatment (cont.) 

3  One-off costs (e.g. smart meters campaign) 
 usually have a short payback period (may happen 
in between price control reviews) 
 Penalty payments 
 typically associated to deficiencies in quality of 
service 
 regulator should estimate a “reasonable level of 
failure”  allow for the associated penalty 
payments (actually an ongoing controllable cost) 
49 

Elements of price control 
Investment & the rate base 
 The level of the initial assets (rate base) is critical & 
may be difficult to determine in case a previous 
rigorous accounting does not exist 
 The volume of expected investment during the price 
control period is a controversial issue 
 based on estimates for an uncertain future 
 firms have incentive to overstate investment needs 
 Depreciation is less critical (if used correctly to 
update the asset rate base) since it does not affect the 
present value of the firm’s revenues 
 it does affect the balance of payments between 
present & future customers 

50 

25 

The regulatory asset base 

 The initial value of the “rate base” (inmovilizado neto 
remunerable, in Spanish) is needed to start the 
sequence in the revenue calculation; it should not be 
revised later (results in regulatory uncertainty) 
 The opening asset base in subsequent periods is 
equal to the opening asset base in the previous 
period plus the actual investment & less the 
allowed depreciation in that period 
 mistakes in the estimation of investment in a 
period can be corrected later & only have a 
relatively minor effect during one period 

51 

The initial asset base (rate base) 

 Alternative evaluation procedures 
 Book value (historic cost valuation) 
 Reproduction cost (current cost of reconstructing the 
same physical plant) 
 Replacement cost (replace plant now with the newest 
technology that is able to perform the same functionality 
as the present plant) 
 Market-value (it can make sense if firm is being 
privatized) 

52 

26 

The rate base (cont. 1) 

 Book value, if it is reliable, & with an adequate rate of 
return, does not result in windfall profits for the firm or 
discontinuities in prices. 
 Replacement cost, subsequently increased to account 
for inflation, reflects best the economic value of the 
assets & leads to efficient prices. However 
 it may lead to an unacceptable increase or reduction 
over current prices 

53 

The rate base (cont. 2) 

 If determination of the rate base is part of a process of 
privatization 
 The regulator may set acceptable prices in advance 
 the rate base results from the market value of 
the firm: compute the rate base (given the rate of 
return) so that the required revenue equals the 
revenue those prices will produce  stranded assets 
 Trade-off for government: obtain a higher price for firm 
versus let consumer prices rise 
 Adjust the amount paid by investors to account for any 
unregulated businesses or the potential to develop them 

54 

27 

New investment 

 Here the firm’s information advantage over 
the regulator is large (infrastructure’s 
conditions, expected demand, etc.) 
 Regulator must assess & reevaluate the firm’s 
proposals with experts’ advice 
 the firm must be able to finance needed 
investments 
 large investments may be assigned by competitive 
bidding & the cost passed through in the price 
control (advisable for transmission networks) 

55 

Depreciation (1) 

 Diverse depreciation methods may be used 
 uniform annuity: constant charge that pays off 
a capital sum plus interest exactly over a time 
period  separate annuity into capital repayment 
(depreciation) & interest (return on capital) 
 straight line: the repayment component 
(depreciation) remains constant & the annual 
charge decreases with time 

56 

28 

Depreciation (2) 
The straight-line method 

Depreciation of a payment of 100 over 7 years at an interest rate of 10% 

Uniformity in depreciation will reflect in the uneven trayectory 
of tariffs 

Depreciation (3) 
The uniform annuity method 

Depreciation of a payment of 100 over 7 years at an interest rate of 10% 

Lack of uniformity in depreciation will help to maintain a 
smooth tariff trajectory 

57 

58 

29 

Depreciation (4) 

 All methods result in the same present value 
of revenue (if applied correctly)  
 but they affect the distribution of charges 
between present & future consumers 
 depreciation patterns also affect the firm’s tax bill 
 in general it is advisable a basic coincidence 
between the depreciation of the regulatory asset 
& the actual depreciation policy of the firm 

59 

Elements of price control 
Notes on revenues (1) 
 if the volumes of the firm’s sales were fixed, a 
price control of RPI-1 would result in a 
reduction in revenues of 1%, but 
 sales change with time; items with different prices 
may change proportions 
 there may be unregulated sales 
 quality of service may also change (a reduction in 
quality is equivalent to a hidden price increase) 

60 

30 

Elements of price control 
Notes on revenues (2) 

 The firm may have incentives to manipulate 
its sales predictions 
 If the firm wants to persuade the regulator of the 
need for large investments  the firm will predict 
high sales growth 
 If the firm wants to persuade the regulator of no 
price reduction or even price increase  the firm 
will predict low sales growth 

61 

Elements of price control 
The rate of return 

 The rate of return r is a key variable in price 
control, since it directly affects present value 
analysis 
 r determines the average remuneration of the 
firm’s capital 
 r  d=1/(1+r) determines the discount factor d 
in present value calculations 

62 

31 

The rate of return 
 Basic formula 
Weighted average cost of capital WACC = 
= Share of equity x cost of equity + 
+ Share of debt x cost of debt 
 Example:  
 Firm with debt/equity ratio of 40/60, 4% cost of debt, 8% 
cost of equity  6.4% weighted average cost of capital 
 Caution: increasing the leverage (debt/equity ratio) 
also increases the cost of equity 
 The actual cost of debt, if found to be reasonably 
incurred, may be accepted as a given input in the 
price control process 

63 

The cost of equity 

 The cost of equity can be estimated from

The capital asset pricing model 

 CAPM assumes that the return on any asset is 
equal to 
 the risk-free rate of return for that economy 
(this is the amount that investors could receive on the 
safest asset available, typically government bonds, taking 
the average over the last few years, & with a long life to 
reflect the life span of the firm’s assets) 
 plus a risk premium to reflect the specific 
additional risk of each asset (different methods are 
needed for debt & equity) 

65 

The capital asset pricing model 
The cost of equity 

 Risk premium on the firm’s equity is assumed to be 
proportional (the beta coefficient ß) to the volatility 
of the value of the asset when compared to the 
average market’s volatility 
Return on equity = Risk-free rate +  
+ ß . Average risk premium of the market 
ß = covariance[return on shares of the asset, average 
return of market]/variance[average return of 
market] 
Average risk premium of market = average return of 
market - risk-free rate

The cost of equity  
(continuation) 

 In countries without an international or liquid 
stock market including this or similar industries 
 Cost of equity = risk-free rate + country risk + risk 
of the firm in relation to the average risk of the

The effect of taxation 

 Taxes directly affect the cash flow of the firms 
 the tax bill in a given year is affected by the adopted 
depreciation strategy  
 Consistency of rate of return computations  if a 
post-tax rate of return is used, the tax payments of a firm 
must be included as part of the costs it is allowed to 
recover 
 In some regulatory instances the interest 
payments on debt are tax deductible

RPI-X: Techniques for cost estimation 
Reference models 

 A model is developed to determine the cost of 
providing the same service by an ideal utility 
 This model may not be used directly to compute 
the remuneration of an actual utility 
 At least, it provides an objective & accurate way of 
comparing costs of different utilities 
 It can also be applied to compare the current & 
past costs of a given utility 

71 

RPI-X: Techniques for cost estimation  
Average incremental cost 
 A model  (like  a  reference model)  is  developed  to  determine 
the additional cost of  the utility  in a year  t+N when  the cost 
in t is known 
 Charges  are  computed  from  the  sensitivities  of  these 
additional  costs  with  respect  to  increments  in  demand  (at 
each voltage level, in the case of a distribution utility) 
  Therefore  remuneration of  the entire asset base  is determined  from 
designs & costs with today’s technologies 
  The  outcome  also  depends  on  how  well  adapted  is  the  existing 
network 
  Note  that  this  approach  emphasizes  allocative  efficiency  (i.e. 
marginal pricing) over sustainability  there  is no guarantee of cost 
recovery) 
72

Comments 
On the state-of-the-art (1) 

 The theory is well established (Joskow, 2006) 
 However, implementation has proven much harder 
than initially expected 
 Under imperfect information, the regulator needs to 
balance viability of the firm, cost reduction to consumers, 
quality of service & network losses  
 Critical importance of data that are comprehensive & 
reliable 
 A major effort has been made by regulators to develop & 
use adequate tools to estimate the firms’ future costs 
during the control period 

75 

Comments 
On the state-of-the-art (2) 

 Behind the impression of technical precision & state-
of-the-art practice, in reality there is no template & 
there is ample scope for negotiation 
 There is a tendency towards complexity 
 The process is becoming more resource intensive & more 
intrusive, involving large teams of regulators, firm 
managers & consultants 
 Sophisticated instruments have been developed for 
benchmarking or to recreate virtual efficient utilities 
 All of which have pros & cons, but cannot be trusted in isolation 
 Tactical use by the regulator & the regulated company 
 There is the danger of micromanagement 

76 

38 

Comments 
On the state-of-the-art (3) 
 One of the main strengths of incentive regulation (& 
RPI-X in particular) as applied to electric network 
companies has been its versatility and ability to adapt 
 For instance, by using additional mechanisms to mitigate 
risks to the regulated firm (pass-through of uncontrollable 
costs, safety valves, adjustment factors to deal with 
forecasting errors, profit sharing, menu of contracts, etc.) 
 However, quality of service & network losses need to 
be specifically addressed, as well as the additional 
complexity of distributed generation, smart grids & the 
need to promote innovation (see later) 

77 

RPI-X: A clear success, but… 

 ”In the UK, the price cap regulation (in the form of RPI-X) 
has been hugely successful. Since 1990 the electricity 
distribution charges for consumer have been cut by 
50% and transmission charges by 41%. In 15 years to 
2005 power-cuts were reduced to 11% and the 
duration of those interruptions by 30%. Other than that, 
there have been significant improvements in the level 
of investments and reductions in the cost of capital”

78 

39 

…it is time for a revision 

 The emergence of distributed generation & “smart 
grids” are forcing regulators to reconsider how to 
adapt RPI-X to address this more complex situation

 “Ofgem has launched its ‘RPI-X@20’ project to assess whether 
this form of regulation is still fit for purpose. The obvious 
question that this project needs to address is whether the 
scope for real cost and price reductions in the future is feasible 
using RPI-X regulation”.

Investment 
The objective 

 Objective: Optimal trade-off between cost 
(investment, operation) and quality of service & 
losses  
 Mandatory planning is unfeasible  
regulation must be based on global 
performance 
 The remuneration scheme must incentivate 
that the regulatory objective is achieved 

81 

Investment 
Remuneration (1) 
 Regulated monopoly: remuneration based on 
allowed costs 
 Investment costs (network infrastructure) 
 facilities: lines & substations 
 equipment: switching, communications, measure 
& protection  
 Operation costs (operation & maintenance of 
facilities) 
 control centers, personnel, tools, workshops, etc. 
82 

41 

Investment 
Remuneration (2) 
 Principles: 
 Financial viability of the distribution business 
 Recognize the zonal differences in distribution 
costs (load dispersion, terrain, climate, 
overhead versus underground, etc. but not 
decision variables of the distributors, e.g. 
length of lines) 
 Basic remuneration associated to the minimum 
cost facilities required to distribute with 
prescribed quality of service & losses 
 Prescribed quality of service & losses depend 
on the distribution zone 

83 

Investment 
The remuneration scheme 
 There is no widely accepted approach 
(although RPI-X is becoming very popular) 
 Some approaches that have been 
considered & applied 
 Cost-of-service 
 RPI - X (price cap, revenue cap) 
 Benchmarking 
 Reference models 
 Average incremental cost 
 Yardstick competition

The remuneration scheme 
Cost-of-service 

 Based on utility ’s audited records 
 Cumbersome because of large number of 
facilities 
 Lack of incentives for attaining 
 optimal investment level 
 optimal quality of service 
 optimal level of network losses 

The remuneration scheme 
RPI-X with Benchmarking 

 Requires a large data base of costs and 
relevant characteristics of comparable 
distribution utilities 
 The adequate remuneration of a new 
distributor is obtained from the existing data 
by statistical means 

85 

86 

43 

The remuneration scheme 
RPI-X with Reference models 

 A model is developed to determine the cost of 
serving the actual load by an ideal distribution 
utility 
 This kind of models cannot be used directly to 
compute the remuneration of an actual distributor 
 However, it provides an objective & accurate way 
of comparing costs of different distributors 
 It can also provide a good estimate of the 
additional investment and O&M costs for the next 
price control period 

87 

The remuneration scheme 
RPI-X with Average incremental cost 

 A model is developed to determine the 
additional cost of distribution in a year t+N 
when the cost in t is known 
 Distribution charges are computed from the 
sensitivities of these additional costs with 
respect to increments in demand at each 
voltage level 

88 

44 

The remuneration scheme 
Light-handed regulation 

 The distribution utilities themselves determine 
non-discriminatory network charges for their 
customers 

 The regulator supervises the charges and may 
impose mandatory changes

Quality of service & losses 
 Two shortcomings of pure “RPI-X like” 
incentive schemes: The firm has the incentive 
to reduce costs at the expense of quality of 
service & network losses 
 Quality of service: Network reference models can 
also help in implementing otherwise theoretical 
approaches  
 Losses: Its contribution to an optimal design of the 
distribution networks is frequently overlooked 

Quality of service 
The basic components   
 Continuity of supply 
 Number & duration of long interruptions of 
supply 
 Quality of the technical product 
 Voltage level, harmonic content, flicker, short 
interruptions, etc. 
 Quality of commercial service 
 Waiting time for connection, handling of 
complaints, reading & invoicing, additional 
services, etc.

Quality of technical service 
Objectives of regulation 

Three compatible objectives to be achieved: 
 Adapt distribution remuneration to the actual level 
of quality of service 
 A cost / benefit approach 
 Guarantee a minimum level of quality of service to 
all consumers 
 Use a social / political criterion 
 Maximize social global welfare 
 Try to achieve the optimal level of quality of service 

95 

Quality standards 

 Reducing the quality of service is an easy way 
to cut costs (& it is a hidden price increase) 
 regulator should put pressure on the firm 
to achieve an adequate quality level 
 Collect & publish data on diverse indicators of the 
firm’s performance (most effective if there are 
several firms), e.g. 
 time of reconnection after faults 
 delay for connection of new customers 
 % of meters read (rather than estimated) 
 % of customer letters answered within 10 days 

96 

48 

Quality standards (cont.) 
 Compensate economically those customers who are 
victims of poor service 
 it is required to measure the quality of service of 
customers on an individual basis, both commercial 
attention to the consumer & quality of the delivered 
product, and check it against prescribed standards 
 Explicitly include a factor reflecting actual quality of 
service in the determination of the firm’s allowable 
revenue 
 regulated remuneration (prices) is assumed to correspond 
to prescribed standards (zonal & global) of quality 
 an auditable system of measuring quality is required 

97 

Incentive schemes for quality of 
service 
  Technical quality of service directly depends on the 
level of investment + operation & maintenance in 
the distribution network 
  Therefore, remuneration of the distribution activity 
must be associated to  
 a) the actual quality of service that is provided 
 b) the progress towards a target level of quality of 
service that the regulator considers to be optimal 
 
Incentives & penalties should be associated to deviations with 
respect to this target level 
  Target levels should be area specific 

98 

49 

Incentive schemes for quality of 
service 
  The challenge is to combine economic incentives 
for quality of service with some kind of revenue 
cap remuneration scheme in a consistent manner 
  This would require to set the reference revenue cap on 
the basis of the actual delivered quality of service 
  and to add a penalty or a credit for deviations, in such a 
way that the company has an incentive to improve 
quality up to the optimal level (which is area specific, i.e. 
rural, urban, etc.) 
  and so that consumers also benefit from this scheme 

99 

Optimal level of quality of service 

100 

50 

A win-win incentive scheme 

Incentive scheme for losses 

 Network losses do not represent a cost for the 
distribution utility (ohmic losses are a generation cost)  
 This is not a trivial matter, since network losses 
are a major driver for optimal network investment 
& a significant component of the cost of 
electricity 
 Since ohmic losses happen in distribution 
networks, regulation must incentivate operation & 
investment actions by distributors that account 
for losses efficiently 

102 

51 

Incentive scheme for losses 
 The adequate regulatory scheme should mimic the 
one that has been described for quality of service 
 The reference revenue cap should be based on the current 
level of losses in the network 
 Add a penalty or a credit for deviations, in such a way that 
the company has an incentive to reduce losses up to the 
optimal level (which is also area specific, i.e. rural, urban, etc.) 
 So that consumers also benefit from this scheme 
 Network Reference Models (NRMs) can be used to 
determine the incentive factor 
 As with quality of service, simpler versions have been used 
elsewhere 
103 

Distributed generation 
A new regulatory context 
 Increased penetration of generation in distribution 
networks will require new forms of evaluation of the 
relationship between distribution costs & investments, 
losses & quality of service 
 Distribution grid operators are reluctant to enable large-
scale integration of generation facilities into their 
distribution grids, unless the corresponding extra cost 
drivers in this context are not understood, quantified & 
cost recovery is guaranteed 
 Network Reference Models may be useful here 
 Preliminary regulatory experience in the UK 

106 

52 

Distributed generation 
Details Negative incentives 

 Contrary to transmission, distribution networks originally 
are not designed to accommodate generation  design, 
operation, control & regulation have to be adapted to 
allow potential massive deployment of DG 

 Under passive network management DG penetration 
generally results in additional costs of network investment 
& losses, an effect that increases with penetration levels 
 distribution utilities may be biased against DG & may 
create barriers to its deployment 

107 

Distributed generation 
Details Need for advanced models 

 Revised regulation of the distribution activity (DSO) 
 Refine the models of remuneration of distribution 
networks, so that the extra costs/benefits of 
accommodating DG & efficiency measures are recognized 
& negative incentives are minimized 
 Incentive-based regulation to reduce network losses & to 
improve quality of service, but now including DG in the 
scheme (e.g. adapting the performance indicators for losses & 
quality of service to the level of DG penetration)  
 Find instruments to incorporate deployment of effective 
innovative technologies in the remuneration schemes 

112 

Distributed generation 
Details Reference Network Models (RNM) 
 A RNM is a network that minimizes the total cost of 
 Investment 
 O&M costs 
 Energy losses in the network 
 while meeting prescribed continuity of supply targets 
(or explicitly including the cost of non supplied energy) in the 
different supply areas (e.g. urban, suburban, concentrated 
rural, dispersed rural) 
 RNMs may be used as an aide or benchmark (with any 
required adjustments) when  
 computing the revenue cap for the next period 
 designing incentive schemes for losses or quality of service

negative & significant impact on the economic 
results of some firm or institution 
 Non discriminated power interruption is not a 
solution 
 It may affect consumers who pay 
 There is a potential willingness to pay that is wasted

PRICING

118 

59 

Pricing 
The objective 
 Objective: To allocate the global remuneration 
of the distribution network to the individual users 
 Distribution charges are a component of 
 the “integral” tariff (for non-qualified consumers) 
 the “access” tariff (for qualified consumers) 
 Any charges to connected generators 
 Distribution charges should 
 be cost reflective 
 completely recover the network costs 

119 

Pricing 
Structure of distribution charges 

 Typical regulated distribution charges in the 
tariffs of most systems (only for demand) 
 Connection charge (€, paid only once): for a new 
connection to the network or the extension of an 
existing connection 
 Commercial charge (€, annual charge per type of 
customer): typically charged only to captive 
consumers; strictly not a distribution charge 
 Use-of-system charge (typically with an energy 
€/kWh & a capacity €/kW component): to recover 
the remaining distribution network total costs 

120 

60 

Pricing (distribution network tariffs) 
Why not nodal prices? 
 Most regulators prefer not to make distinctions 
between the distribution charges of identical 
consumers connected at different nodes in the 
distribution network 
 It seems that distribution  nodal prices can be 
widely different in neighboring nodes & they may 
depend much on the flow patterns & the 
functioning of the technical devices in the network 
 This topic has not received much attention yet, 
although distributed generation has created the 
need for an in-depth analysis 

121 

Pricing (distribution network tariffs) 
The procedure (just for demand)  
 Split the network cost into the partial costs of 
the different voltage levels 
 Every consumer pays only the costs of its 
voltage level and upstream 
 Capacity charge ($/kW) 
 based on the coincidental peak demand 
 Energy charge ($/kWh) 
 accounts for non peak consumption & besides, it is a 
proxy for peak demand for (small) consumers without 
adequate meters 

122 

61 

Pricing (distribution network tariffs) 
Some ideas (to include also generation)  
 It is becoming clearer the need to send 
locational & operation signals to potential & 
existing distributed generation 
 Locational connection charges for siting 
 Based on the location of the generator in the distribution 
network & the need for reinforcements 
 Network-related factors for remuneration of 
energy production 
 To incentivate production at times when local prices for 
energy or ancillary services are high, or emergency 
conditions may exist

Access 
The objective 

Objective: 
 To establish the rules of use of the 
distribution network so that 
 no agent is discriminated 
 there is no abuse of the monopolistic power of 
the distributor 
 To charge adequately for the facilities to 
connect to the network 

125 

Obligation of supply 
(typically associated to supplier of last resort) 

 Service is mandatory to all existing & new 
users in the franchise area 
 Connection charges require specific regulation 
 new users 
 capacity expansions of existing users 
 Access conditions require specific regulation 
 when network reinforcements are required 
 when access is required by competitors (depending on 
consumers´ choice capability) 

126 

63 

Access 
 Representative cases 
 Consumers directly connected to a distribution 
network 
 and supplied by it 
 and supplied by an independent retailer 
 Generators directly connected to a distribution 
network 
 selling the power to this distributor 
 selling the power elsewhere 
 Wholesale transactions using a distribution network 
and involving: 
 other distribution utility 
 a directly connected eligible consumer 
 a directly connected generator 

127 

Access 
Conflicts with access rights 
 Basic principles 
 Universal right to connection 
 Incurred costs must be born by network users 
 Access rights are independent of choice of retailer 
 The regulator will solve any existing conflicts 
 abuses of dominant position 
 lack of definition of territorial franchises 
 Discrimination of small distributors with respect to other 
clients of its supplier & to clients that are served by 
other suppliers 

128 

64 

Access 
Conflicts with connection charges 

 Should the cost of every connection be 
individualized? 
 uniform charge up to a threshold 
 individualized charges beyond 
 Physical construction of connections should 
not be a monopoly of the incumbent 
distributor 
 minimum design & operational requirements 

129 

Obligation of supply 
RURAL ELECTRIFICATION 

  Some rural areas may lack electricity supply 
  The cost of supply in these areas typically far exceeds the 
average distribution cost  decentralized systems with local 
generation may be the best option 
  The risk of no payment may also be higher than average 
 Some ad hoc scheme is needed to develop distribution 
networks to these areas 
 Subsidies from the Government will be needed 
 Desirable to involve private interests  
 Use market mechanisms for assignment of subsidies 
whenever possible 
 Avoid dependency from subsidies: assign just once 

131 

65 

Rural electrification 
Case example (Chile) 

 Governmental agency issues a request for proposals 
each year, indicating the total amount of subsidies 
to be awarded 
 Selection criteria: maximize the social impact of subsidy: 
largest number of connections & lowest cost for end user 
 The subsidy turns unattractive projects for the private 
firms into attractive ones 
 Once built, the new facilities must be treated as any other 
distribution facility of the winning firm

Regulatory instruments 

 In each price review the regulator basically uses 
two kinds of instruments to help in the 
estimation of the future costs of the firm & to 
reduce the problem of information asymmetry 
 Regulatory accounting systems (historic record of  
OPEX, investment, and DSO assets) 
 Models to estimate the network costs 
(benchmarking or network reference models) 

Case example 
Spain (Royal Decree RD 222/2008) 

 The new regulatory scheme establishes incentives for 
 Efficient investment to meet demand increments & new 
connections 
 Improvements in continuity of supply 
 Network loss reductions 
 Information asymmetry is mitigated by the use of 
 Regulatory accounting 
 Network reference models 
 Network reference models provide a benchmark for 
investment and O&M costs, while taking into account 
continuity of supply requirements and network loss 
reduction targets

Network reference models (NRM) 

 NRM is a network that minimizes the total cost of 
 Investment 
 O&M costs 
 Energy losses in the network 
 while meeting prescribed continuity of supply targets 
(or explicitly including the cost of non supplied energy) in the 
different supply areas (e.g. urban, suburban, concentrated 
rural, dispersed rural) 
 NRMs may be used as an aide or benchmark (with any 
required adjustments) when  
 computing the revenue cap for the next period 
 designing incentive schemes for losses or quality of service 
5 

Network reference models (NRM) 

 Network reference models can be used as: 
 Greenfield models: An efficient distribution 
network is developed from scratch, starting from  
the GPS location & demand of consumers and the 
location of transmission substations 
 Assessing utility’s network technical efficiency as a 
benchmark of actual networks 
 Development of networks in the long-term under 
technological uncertainty (Smart-grids paradigm) 

6 

3 

Network reference models (NRM) 

 Network reference models can be also used 
as: 
 Incremental models: The model efficiently 
reinforces the existing network to address 
estimated demand increments and new 
connections during the price control period 
 Network reinforcements in the short and medium-term 
 Analysis of costs/benefits of DG penetration, response 
demand actions, or energy efficiency programs 

Network reference models (NRM) 

 Since the data to perform benchmarking are 
frequently not available  NRMs are an interesting 
alternative 
 Their purpose is NOT to micromanage the distribution 
company, but 
 To reduce the lack of information of the regulator 
 To provide sound numerical values for some incentive 
schemes (e.g. losses, quality of service) 
 Network reference models have been used in 
Argentina, Chile, Spain or Sweden

Network reference models (NRM) 

 Elements of the planning function 
 Capital expenditure (CAPEX) 
 Costs of building the network 
 Operational expenditure (OPEX) 
 Operation & Maintenance costs of the network

Capital expenditures (CAPEX) 

 Electricity networks are very intensive 
in capital investment 
 New customers connections 
 Investment in new network installations 
 Upgrade of old installations

Operation Expenditures (OPEX) 

 Operational expenditures (OPEX) 
 Maintenance of the elements of the networks 
 Operation of the network 
 Highly correlated to the CAPEX 
 Almost no “variable cost”: it doesn’t depend on 
the level of utilization of the network 
 Once the CAPEX is known (along with its 
characteristics), the OPEX can be determined 
(assuming an efficiency level) 

Planning function 
 To understand the CAPEX, we need to 
understand the network planning function 
 Minimize {investment + losses + OPEX} 
Subject to: 
 Capacity (load requirements) 
 Quality (Power quality and continuity of supply) 
 Geography (location of customers, geographical 
constraints) 
 The planning function determines the cost 
function
