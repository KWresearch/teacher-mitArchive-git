Pricing 
What is the objective? 
 To ensure that the energy prices & the 
transmission network charges that are levied to the 
network users 
 send efficient economic signals 
 in the short-term (for operation decisions) 
 in the long-term (for investment & location decisions) 
 recover the complete regulated costs of the 
transmission network 
 are non discriminatory  
 are easy to understand & implement, & perceived as fair  

5

Pricing 
Principles (1 of 2) 
 Efficient transmission charges should be based on 
“cost causality” 
 This translates (remember the rational for justification of 
transmission investment) into 
 allocation to economic beneficiaries of the network or 
 allocation to those users who could be considered 
responsible for the network investment 
 which are really equivalent criteria (& both difficult to 
apply in practice) 
 But this criterion is difficult to apply in practice 

7 

Pricing 
Principles (2 of 2) 
 A proxy: some measure of “physical network 
utilization” could be used instead (where, when & how 
much energy is injected or withdrawn, whether actual, potential 
or estimated) 
 & never related to the particular commercial transaction 
established by the network users since, with well 
informed & rational agents, network utilization does not 
depend on commercial transactions 
 Unfortunately there is no indisputable procedure to 
measure “physical network utilization”  

8

Pricing 
Short-term signals 

 Nodal prices 
 are energy prices that internalize the network 
effects: losses & congestions 
 provide correct economic signals for system 
operation 
 result in a net surplus, which in practice happens 
to be insufficient to recover total network costs 

9 

Pricing 
Long-term signals 
 They are meant to recover the total network 
costs (either jointly with nodal prices or, if nodal 
pricing is not used, by themselves)  transmission 
tariffs 
 based on cost causality of network costs as much 
as possible, or network utilization otherwise 
 these charges should not be transaction-based  
 long-term charges (transmission tariffs) should try to 
avoid interference with (distortion of) short-term 
signals (nodal prices) 

10 

5 

Pricing 
Other network-related signals 
 Network-related locational signals can be also 
sent in other ways 
 Information on estimated future network 
conditions (congestions, loss factors, transmission 
charges) 
 Location dependent capacity mechanisms 
 Definition of firm capacity may depend on location 

PRICING 
Location signals in energy prices 

11

6 

Location signals in energy prices 
Option 1: Nodal prices 

Examples: Argentina, New Zealand, most ISOs in the US 
 Losses & network constraints are implicitly taken care 
of 
 this is very convenient in non well meshed networks, with 
systematic network constraints 
 an algorithm is needed  loss of transparency 
 bilateral physical contracts need some ad hoc solution 
 Nodal prices result in a net revenue (≈ 20%) that can 
be used to partly offset transmission costs   
 need for a complementary charge (≈ 80%) 
 as the complementary charge is so large, the basic network 
cost allocation problem still remains unsolved 
13 

Location signals in energy prices 
Option 2: Zonal prices 

 Examples:  California  &  Texas  (both have moved to 
nodal pricing), NordPool, Italy 
 By  default  there  is  a  single  market  price,  except 
when  any  systematic 
restriction 
inter-zone 
becomes active  zonal prices 
 Revenues  from  application  of  “zonal  prices” 
should  be  used  to  partly  remunerate  network 
costs 
 Sporadic  network  constraints  can  be  solved  via 
redispatch 
14 

7 

Location signals in energy prices 
Option 3: Single energy market price 
 Examples: England & Wales, Colombia, Sweden, 
Spain 
 Coexistence of a single energy market price & 
separate short-term signals for losses & constraints 
 Separate treatment for these concepts: 
 energy market price 
 network cost recovery  transmission tariffs 
 management of network constraints 
 network losses 
 where any net revenues from the schemes that are used to 
deal with losses or constraints may be applied for partial 
network cost recovery 

15 

Single energy market price 
Dealing with losses (1) 
  Losses can be allocated among generators (Lg) and 
demand (Ld) so that their respective outputs & loads 
are modified according to their respective loss factors 
  Example: Consumers in mostly importing areas will be 
charged for more energy than what they consumed: d’=d+Ld. 
  Example: Generators in mostly exporting areas will be paid 
for less energy than what they produced: g’=g-Lg.  
  This scheme should influence the market bids: 
generator bid price = original bid price x g/g’ 
consumer bid price = original bid price x d/d’ 

16 

8 

Single energy market price 
Dealing with losses (2) 
 Bidding process: 
 Loss factors can be estimated by the ISO 
 Participants use their best information to construct bid 
prices 
 Market clearing 
 Final settlements are made using ex-post penalty factors 
based on the resulting dispatch. Previous estimations are 
ignored 
 Some risk associated to errors in the prediction of the 
network conditions (usually not very relevant) 

17 

Single energy market price 
Network congestion management 

 Several  congestion management methods  are 
applicable (see the slides on “access”) 
 Redispatch 
 Countertrade

PRICING 
Transmission tariffs 
(Allocation of network costs: the 
complementary charge) 

Allocation of network costs 
Basic guidelines 

 Network costs should be fully recovered from 
charges applied to the network users 
 Any network costs that are not recovered via nodal 
prices or equivalent signals must be assigned via 
transmission tariffs so that   
 long-term location signals (if needed) are sent (basically of 
interest only to new network users or those who might retire)  
 distortion of short-term economic efficiency is minimized 

19 

20 

10 

Implementation 
How to do it? (1 of 3) 
 How to recover the total network costs?  
 Assign the complementary charge by 
 looking at cost causality of network costs  
•  ideally charge to the economic beneficiaries (remember the drivers 
of an efficient transmission planning)  guide long-term location 
decisions of the agents 
•  in practice replace “benefit” by “electric usage” if allocation to 
beneficiaries is too complex 
 charge any remainder while trying to minimize economic 
distortion  Ramsey-like ideas may help / relative price 
sensitivity of consumers & producers 
 & remember 
 charges should never be transaction-based  
 long-term charges should try to avoid interference with 
(distortion of) short-term signals 
21 

Implementation 
How to do it? (2 of 3) 
 A basic criterion: Make it simple, unless forced by the 
network characteristics, such as: 
 poorly meshed / radial networks with systematic active 
constraints 
 need for major & expensive reinforcements, so that cost 
allocation becomes a contentious issue 
 multiplicity of connection applications by generators, so that 
locational signals should be an essential ingredient in 
efficient siting decisions 
 There is competition between alternative projects or 
technologies (e.g. gas by pipe vs. gas by line) so that 
network charges might decide  

22 

11 

Implementation 
How to do it? (3 of 3) 
 How to split the network cost among generators & 
consumers? 
 “Fundamentalist” reasoning 
 “Generators need the network to sell their product” 
 “Consumers need the network to access the product” 
 lacks economic fundament 
 Use “cost causality” as much as reasonably 
possible 
 at least try that the distortion of economic efficiency is minimized 
 Ramsey pricing (assign costs in inverse proportion to price 
elasticity)  Note that, in a competitive electricity market, 
generation is more price elastic than most of the consumers 

23 

Transmission tariffs 
Approaches used in practice 
 Beneficiaries 
 Try to evaluate the economic benefit that each network user 
obtains from the existence of each individual transmission 
facility and allocate its cost pro-rata to each user 
 Responsibility in investment 
 Try to evaluate the extra investment cost that each network 
user imposes on to the existing network, besides its 
dedicated (shallow) connection 
 Network utilization  
 Try to evaluate the power flow that each network user 
causes (marginally or as average) on each transmission 
facility and allocate its cost pro-rata to each user 
 Postage stamp 
  Plus interesting ideas not yet used: e.g. Aumann-Shapley 

24

Transmission tariffs 
Option 1: Beneficiaries 
 Evaluate the economic benefit that each network user 
obtains from the existence of each individual 
transmission facility and allocate its cost pro-rata to 
each user 
  When a facility meets the golden investment rule, the aggregated 
benefits exceed its cost  this method minimizes distortion in 
long term decisions of users & promotes participation in coalitions 
to build lines 
 It inspired the overall regulatory approach in 
Argentina & it has become increasingly popular 
because of its sound economic basis & superficial 
“political” appeal  
 But it faces insurmountable implementation difficulties 
in general (except perhaps only for new investments) 
25 

detail 
The notion of benefit 
 Benefit: “the economic impact that, for a network 
user, derives from the existence of a network 
installation (or a group of them)” 
 The absolute benefit of an agent in the market should not 
be considered to be equal to the benefit that is derived from 
the existence of a particular network asset 
 In general, but not always, both generators & consumers 
have network-derived benefits 
 Network derived benefits are difficult to determine: electrical 
use is often used as a proxy; however, in all cases, at least 
use the benefit as a conceptual guide 

26 

13 

Transmission tariffs 
Option 2: Responsibility in investment 

 Evaluate the extra investment cost that each 
network user imposes on to the existing network, 
besides its dedicated (shallow) connection  
 The ICRP (investment cost related pricing) method 
in UK, & Colombia later, is an example 
 It makes sound economic sense; however 
 all yet proposed evaluation methods are questionable & 
results depend much on the assumptions 
 difficulties in allocating 100% of the total cost  resort 
to Ramsey pricing  

27 

Transmission tariffs 
Option 3: Network use 
 Evaluate the power flow that each network user 
causes (marginally or as average) on each 
transmission facility and allocate its cost pro-rata to 
each user 
 The “areas of influence” method in Chile or Argentina, 
or the “average participations” in New Zealand, Central 
America or Australia are examples; the MWxkm 
method can be also included here 
 However 
 all evaluation methods are questionable 
 weak economic rationale (although it seems to make 
engineering sense to many and it is a proxy to benefit) 

28 

14 

Transmission tariffs 
Option 4: Postage stamp 

 Simple access charge (usually flat, although it may 
depend on location according to some easy rule) that 
allocates 100% of the transmission cost  
 The transmission tariffs in most European countries 
are based on the postage stamp method 
 Recommended when the network characteristics do 
not demand more sophistication (well meshed networks 
without major pending reinforcements & without multiple 
competing requests for access) 
 Cost reflectivity of network charges is achieved here 
by losses & constraint management signals only, not 
in the allocation of network costs

Annex 2 
DETAIL ON THE METHOD OF 
AVERAGE PARTICIPATIONS 
(AP) 

46 

23 

Underlying assumption behind the method 
Average participations (AP) 
 Accepting  the  technical  impossibility  to  assign 
line  flows  unambiguously  to  sinks  or  sources, 
it  is  assumed  that  this  responsibility  can  be  simply 
obtained  by 
flow  upstream  & 
tracking  each 
downstream  following  the  same  paths  &  branching 
proportions that exist  in the actual  flows provided by 
ETSO 
 By  construction,  the  use  of  each  line  is  assigned  50/50  to 
demand  &  generation,  although  this  proportion  may  be 
easily modified  afterwards  if  the  user  of  the  algorithm  has 
a good reason to do so 

49 

Why is not possible to assign the flows to 
sources & sinks? 

  Load flows & circuit theory are just a convenient approximation 
to  electromagnetic  field  theory,  which  is  “as  close  as  we 
can get” to explaining the flow of electromagnetic energy:  
 Energy  flow  is  guided  by  lines  &  takes  place  in  the  broad 
space around them (outside the lines) 
 Energy  flow establishes at  the speed of  light &  is  the 
result  of  the  joint  &  inseparable  contribution  of  all 
sources  &  sinks  acting  together  &  interacting  with  one 
another    it  is  not  possible  to  attribute  a  piece  of  energy 
flow to a particular generator or load 
Probably  the  most  reasonable  thing  to  say  is  that  any 
fraction  of  the  flow  that  is  guided  by  a  line,  branches  in  the 
same  proportion  as  the  total  flow  in  the  line  (this is the basic 
assumption of AP) 

50 

25 

The basic assumption behind AP: If an energy 
flow of 200MW branches as 300, 250 & 250 MW at a node, then…

… then a flow of 50 MW in this same line, which I want to track 
downstream, will branch pro rata to 300, 250 & 250 in the same lines 
that meet at the node

The same idea applies when attributing responsibility for a flow in the 
upstream direction: since the energy flow of 200MW plus the load of 
300MW comes from the input flows of 200 & 300MW, then…

Is AP a reasonable method? 

 It  tracks  the  flows  as  they  are,  with  no  other 
spurious  assumptions:  If  the  complete  flow  (200  MW) 
branches as it does, a fraction of it (50 MW) will branch in the 
same proportion 
 Do the flows die too soon with AP? 
 Who has the a priori knowledge to tell how far or close the 
flows  die?  They  do  what  they  do;  AP  does  not  change 
reality 
 Some of the actual flows travel far 
 Some  small  inconsistencies  may  happen  at  micro  level, 
which can be fixed & are irrelevant for ITC 

59 

Is AP a reasonable method? 

There is also an economic justification for AP 
 If  we  accept  that  power  in  a  line  only  flows  in  the 
direction  of  the  actual  flows (this is, we do not think of 
decomposing actual flows as superposition of many flows 
going in all directions),  then  the  transmission  charges 
resulting from the application of AP coincide with the 
Shapley  value  for  each  agent  in  a  cooperative  game 
with  good  properties  in  terms  of  fairness,  efficiency 
& stability 
 AP  &  a  new  cost  allocation  method  named  Aumann-
Shapley,  with  strong  economic  basis,  have  given  very 
similar  numerical  results  on  test  cases  performed  in  the 
Brazilian transmission network

Basic contracting formats  
Financial bilateral contracts (1)
A bilateral agreement, or via an organized power 
exchange, resulting in an economic transaction 
between two parties that is referenced to a 
market price (typically the hourly spot price of the daily 
market) 
–  Its direct implications are strictly economical, 
therefore they are ignored in the physical dispatch 
& they do not have to be reported to the System 
Operator (SO)
–  They do not require physical delivery of the 
product, this is just an economic transaction

Formatos de contratación - 8 

Basic contracting formats  
Financial bilateral contracts (2)

–  Any legal person can be a party to these 
contracts, not necessarily a market agent  this 
increases liquidity
–  The price risk in the contract is naturally hedged if 
the contracted quantities correspond to actual 
production & demand of the contracting parties
•  Otherwise the risks are large
–  There are sometimes difﬁculties with the deﬁnition 
of the reference price
•  If the price transitorily ceases to exist (e.g. if there 
is no market clearing price (this is very unusual))

Formatos de contratación - 9 

Basic contracting formats  
Financial bilateral contracts (3)
–  Several possible formats:
–  CfDs, options, etc.
–  The price of reference could be
–  The hourly energy price in a day ahead market 
(most usual)
–  The difference in nodal prices between two speciﬁed 
nodes
–  A basket of energy prices in different markets
–  The parties to these contracts, generators or 
consumers, can also buy or sell electricity in any 
organized short-term markets that might exist, at 
the corresponding prices, with total independence 
of the ﬁnancial bilateral contracts

Formatos de contratación - 10 

Basic contracting formats  
Firm bilateral contracts (1)
Bilateral agreements, typically, with the following 
implications for the contracting parties:  
1.  The supply price is established in the contract, 
whose terms are conﬁdential
•  The meaning of the agreed quantity Q depends of the 
type of contract (see later)
•  The price may include an energy component Pe (€/
MWh) and also a capacity component Pp (€/MW) to 
remunerate ﬁrmness
•  The consuming entity will pay & the generator will 
receive the contract price, with independence of the 
local energy price (& capacity price, if any) in their 
respective markets, although they will be subject to 
any speciﬁed charges/credits as market participants
–  difference in the corresponding nodal prices 
–  deviations with respect to declared contracted quantities
–  charges or credits for use or provision of ancillary services

Formatos de contratación - 11 

Basic contracting formats  
Firm bilateral contracts (2)
2.  A physical bilateral contract has the commitment of 
physical delivery of the product; therefore if the 
generator fails (or prefers not to produce) the 
generator must provide back-up generation or buy 
the electricity locally
–  The price & format of the local acquisition of energy (if any) 
depend on the characteristics of the local electricity market 
where it has to be purchased, for instance
•  day ahead energy market, followed by intraday markets in a 
power exchange (as in Spain)
•  day ahead energy market in a power exchange or 
balancing market closer to real time (as in the UK)
–  Note that in the ﬁnancial contracts the agreed reference price 
may be different from any actual price in any market (e.g. it 
could be a basket of prices)

Firm bilateral contracts (3)

3.  The consumer party has priority in the physical 
supply (complete guarantee of supply is impossible), 
under conditions of scarcity, with respect to 
similar consumers without ﬁrm contracts. But the 
contact has to meet the following conditions:
•  The contracted generation capacity has to meet 
any conditions that are required at domestic or 
regional level to qualify as ﬁrm capacity; at least:
–  the capacity can only be committed once

transactions) by the country of origin

(continuation)
–  in case of scheduled unavailability of the generator during 
the time of the contract, there must be a committed back-
up capacity
–  Other ﬁrmness conditions are also possible
•  There must be sufﬁcient available network 
capacity so that the contracted transaction is 
physically possible
–  If necessary, satisfaction of this condition may require that 
the contracting parties purchase some amount of ﬁrm 
transmission rights (FTRs) between the nodes (or the 
zones) where the two parties are physically located
–  Any concerned system operators (one or more) have to 
establish the mechanisms to allocate the FTRs & verify 
that this condition is met

4 Physical bilateral contracts must be declared to 
the SO & they have physical implications
•  Self dispatch by the generator & consumer, who do 
not need to go to any organized market
–  optionally, if there is no scarcity problem in the local supply 
to the consumer, the generator may purchase the energy 
at the consumer location
•  Since the contract has associated FTRs, there is no 
need to resort to any short-term congestion 
management mechanism
•  When buyer & seller belong to different “control 
areas” & there is no common coordinated dispatch, 
the contract has to be accounted for by the 
respective OS to establish the import / export 
programs

“Firm” bilateral contracts  
“Firm” transmission rights (1)
•  If FTRs are not really “ﬁrm” (just ﬁnancial)
–  FTRs are “contracts for differences” with a 
quantity Q and a reference price 
nodal price k – nodal price j
–  The FTRs provide a hedge for the contracted 
amount Q against the actual price difference 
between nodes k & j
–  Every hour the FTR is paid
Q x (nodal price k – nodal price j)
 If the parties of the contract are trading Q during 
that hour, they can do it at the agreed price, 
ignoring the value of the nodal prices (however, 
they should not ignore grandmaʼs theorem)

“Firm” bilateral contracts  
“Firm” transmission rights (2)
•  FTRs have to be purchased
–  The right price of an FTR for a quantity Q & a 
duration T between nodes k & j is the expected 
average value of (nodal price k – nodal price j) during 
the period T, multiplied by Q.T
 The income that could be obtained from selling FTRs 
for all the lines in a well developed network is 
expected to be much lower than the cost of that 
network (about 20% of its cost)
 In speciﬁc cases the FTRs could pay for the costs of 
a line, or more, while any existing systematic 
congestion situation lasts
 “simultaneous feasibility” implying “revenue 
adequacy” is needed to ensure the counterparty (the 
ISO) does not incur in unacceptable risks

Firm transmission rights (1)

•  If FTRs are really “ﬁrm”
–  They are not limited to hedge ﬁnancially against 
the uncertainty in the difference of nodal prices of 
the consumer & the generator
–  They also guarantee that the contract has 
enough network capacity available  between the 
two considered nodes
•  Then the concerned SO(s) have to verify the 
simultaneous feasibility of all awarded FTRs
–  Note that “simultaneous feasibility” implies “revenue 
adequacy” (i.e. the counterparty of all the FTRs, 
typically the OS, has no risk in collecting congestion 
rents to pay for the FTRs if the network operates 
under normal conditions)

Firm bilateral contracts  
Firm transmission rights (2)

•  The “truly ﬁrm” FTRs actually contain two 
different products, each one with a different 
economic value
–  Financial hedging with respect to the difference 
in the local nodal prices of the buyer & seller 
(this is all that the purely ﬁnancial FTRs provide)
–  Allow buyer & seller to sign a ﬁrm bilateral 
contract so that the seller contributes truly ﬁrm 
guarantee of supply to the buyer
•  this second service also has an economic value 
by itself

Firm bilateral contracts 
Discussion (1)
•  The ﬁrmness requirement
–  It is not enough the “obligation” of physical delivery 
at the consumerʼs node; it is also required to have 
the means to meet this commitment
•  sufﬁcient ﬁrm generation capacity that is available 
when needed
•  sufﬁcient dedicated network capacity to physically 
deliver the contracted amount
–  Otherwise, the consumer has contracted an 
economic compensation in case there is scarcity of 
supply, but not an enhanced guarantee of supply
•  Some regulations require that all consumers are 
covered with ﬁrm contracts

Firm bilateral contracts 
Discussion (2)
•  Under normal conditions, when there is no 
deﬁcit of supply to meet the demand that the 
consumer has contracted
–  The generator may prefer to be physically  
replaced by another generator (without network 
limitations) or to buy the electricity locally by the 
consumer location, instead of producing it
•  This is economically efﬁcient & should be 
encouraged
•  Under scarcity conditions by the consumerʼs 
location, the local purchase is not possible & 
only a ﬁrm contract guarantees the supply (while 
the conditions that make the contract ﬁrm hold)

Physical bilateral contracts (1)
This term has been used with incomplete 
versions of bilateral ﬁrm contracts, which always 
include the condition of physical delivery by the 
location of the consumer  
What deﬁnes these contracts?
–  The commitment of physical delivery
•  with electricity produced by the contracted 
generator or by any other unit
•  or with local energy by the consumer, if available
•  the contract is declared to the SO & there is no 
need to bid into a power exchange
–  The economic settlement, similar to ﬁnancial or 
ﬁrm contracts

What is missing in these contracts?
–  (typically) Firm network rights, in case the available 
local supply for the consumer party is insufﬁcient
–  Firmness in generation capacity (or authorization to 
export, in case of emergency in the country where the 
generator is located, in an international context)

Physical bilateral contracts 
Discussion
•  Physical bilateral contracts are riskier than 
ﬁrm bilateral contracts
–  For the seller: since he will have to buy energy 
at the consumer local price if there is lack of 
network capacity or generator availability
–  For the buyer: since the probability of loss of 
supply is higher (even if there is an economic 
compensation)
•  Physical contracts must be declared & have 
the same physical obligations than ﬁrm 
contracts
–  And (depending of the speciﬁc regulation) without ﬁrm 
transmission rights it may be necessary to enter 
in the short-term mechanisms of network 
congestion management

Case example: Spain  
The Spanish physical bilateral contracts
•  Required: physical delivery; declaration to the 
SO; deviations of actual production & 
consumption must be solved by the contracting 
parties in short-term markets (intraday or 
deviations markets)
•  FTRs
–  are not required for domestic transactions & 
generators participate (as any other generator) 
in the mechanism of congestion management
–  must be obtained in ad hoc auctions for 
transactions across the French border
•  Do not provide any additional guarantee of 
supply
