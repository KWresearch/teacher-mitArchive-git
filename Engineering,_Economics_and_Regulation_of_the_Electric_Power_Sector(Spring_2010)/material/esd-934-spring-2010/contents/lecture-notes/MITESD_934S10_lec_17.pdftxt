Regulatory principles 

 Sustainability: guarantee of recovery of all 
regulated costs so that the electrical power sector 
is economically viable 
 Equity or Non Discrimination in the allocation 
of costs to consumers: Same charge should apply 
to the same provision of a service, regardless the 
end use of the electricity.  
 This would be in line with a cost allocation procedure based on 
cost causality 

6 

3 

Regulatory principles 
 Economic efficiency: Two types are considered: 
 Productive: produce the good or service at minimum cost & 
meeting prescribed quality standards 
 Allocative efficiency: promote efficiency in consumption of the 
good in the short & long term 
 Tariffs must sent economic signals that promote efficient operation & 
investment. This requires that costs should be assigned to those who 
are responsible for them (criterion of cost causality) 
 Then, use marginal costs / prices whenever possible  
 If there are still costs to be assigned 
•  apply “cost causality” as far as it is possible 
•  &, finally, try to minimize any inevitable distortion in the 
economic decisions of the consumers 

7 

Regulatory principles 

 Transparency: in the methodology, so that all 
employed criteria & procedures are made public 
 Stability: in the adopted methodology, so that 
the concerned agents have the least possible 
regulatory uncertainty. Stability is compatible with 
a gradual process of adaptation of the present 
tariffs to the new system 
 Simplicity: in the methodology & its 
implementation, as far as possible 

8 

4 

Regulatory principles 

 Additivity: derived from the principles of 
efficiency & sustainability. End user tariffs must be 
the outcome of adding all applicable cost concepts 
 Consistency: with the specific regulatory process 
of each country 
 Other principles: 
 Universal service: everybody must have access to 
electricity 
 Protection of low income consumers 
 Protection of the environment

Conflicts among principles (1)

Conflicts among principles (2) 

It is necessary to establish a priority among 
principles & to reach reasonable agreements on 
how to proceed. This may depend much on the 
context within which the regulation takes place.  

11 

Regulatory principles 
A pragmatic summary 

 Tariffs must comply with the accepted 
regulatory principles. At least they should: 
 Guarantee recovery of the total regulated cost for 
each activity 
 Be additive 
 Be reasonably efficient 
 Send adequate economic signals both in the short & the 
long term 
 Be simple & transparent 

12 

6 

Hints for pragmatic solutions 
 Adopt tariffs with different components, so that it 
is possible to send several simultaneous signals: 
 Time differentiation (since the cost of the system 
depends on the considered time): time-dependent tariffs 
 Short-term energy signals (as close as possible to 
real-time  meant to promote efficient system 
operation): the marginal cost of energy (€/kWh) 
 Long-term signals (meant to promote efficient 
investments & to recover total costs of the activity): by 
means of a fixed term (€) &/or a capacity component (€/
kW) 
 Locational signals (in the network): geographically 
differentiated tariffs

for network planning) & with the known characteristics of

Integral & access tariffs 
 There are two basic types of tariffs 
 Network access tariffs: for qualified consumers 
 Integral  tariffs:  for  captive  (non-qualified)  consumers  or 
those who (may) prefer to stay with a regulated tariff 
 The network access  tariff must be a component of  the 
integral tariff  
 Here  it  will  be  assumed  that  the  network  access  tariff 
includes 
 Network charges 
 Other regulatory charges that apply to all consumers 

18

Typical components of integral & 
access tariffs 
  Energy 
  Capacity charge (long term guarantee of 
supply) 
  Ancillary services costs 
  Extra costs due to technical constraints  
  Network losses 
  Transmission and Distribution network 
charges 
  Regulatory charges (some examples): 
  Institutions (Market Operator, System Operator and 
Regulatory Commission) 
  Incentives to promote cogeneration and renewables 
  Domestic coal support, nuclear moratorium & other 
nuclear costs 
  Compensations to non peninsular territories 
  Stranded costs: competition transition charges 
  Commercialization (retailing) charges 
(belong to both types of tariffs)

Electricity Tariffs 
A conceptual model 
 The basic procedure 
Step 1. Characterize the consumer types & specify 
the tariff structure 
Step 2. Assign each one of the considered costs 
 to each time zone that has been adopted in the tariffs’ 
structure (ideally each hour of the year) 
 or per consumer annual charge (commercialization) 
 or just once (network connection charge) 
 or as percentages of the final tariff (a variety of 
regulatory charges) 
Step 3. Compute each one of the tariffs by 
aggregation 

23 

Step 1. Specify tariff structure & 
characterize consumer types 

A. Define the tariff structure 
 voltage levels 
 time zones (seasons / time-of-day) 
 fixed, capacity &/or energy charges 
 consumer types 
 utilization factors 
B. Determine / estimate the aggregated profile of the 
load for each 
 time zone 
 consumer types 
 & voltage level 

24 

12 

Time zones 
 Time zones allow one to establish tariffs that are 
consistent with the desired time differentiation 
 Time zones must take into account the available 
metering capabilities 
 Time zones must send economic signals to 
consumers regarding the cost of electricity at 
differen times. Then 
 All hours in the year must be classified regarding the level of 
expected incurred supply costs (this is better adapted to 
generation costs) as well as the demand level (this is more 
adapted to network costs) 

26 

Energy & capacity charges 
 Tariff structure must also be consistent with 
 The cost function for each cost component 
 The available information on each consumer type 
 This available information depends on the available meters 
and the format of the electricity contracts 
 Demanded power measurements: maximum demanded power, 
average demanded power per time zone, average demanded 
power 
 Contracted capacity: annual, per time zone 
 Energy measurements 
 A good tariff structure should incentivise an upgrade of the 
capability of electricity meters 
  Cost of new meter vs. savings in electricity bill 

28 

14 

A refinement 
Utilization factor (UF) 

 UF = total consumed energy / contracted capacity, for 
each individual consumer 
 Experimentally, one can determine a curve that fits the 
ideal tariff that would correspond to each consumer 
with its UF 
 It has been found that such a curve exists (it describes the 
behavior of most small and medium consumers), but it 
should be verified and adjusted for each situation 

29 

Tariffs according to the UF 
  Consumers are allowed to choose their tariffs (the straight lines in 
the figure) and they happen to be better off if they choose the 
one that corresponds to their actual UF

 Generation 
 Network & other costs 
 Step 3. Compute tariffs for end users 

31 

Allocation of generation costs 

 This tariff component remunerates the activity of 
generation 
 The preferred approach is based on the short-term 
marginal cost of generation in €/kWh 
 Conveys useful & efficient economic signals 
 Easier to determine than long-term signals 
 (Depending on the adopted approach, if any, to promote 
security of supply) Also add a capacity charge  in €/kW 
 (Depending on the regulation) Add a tariff component in 
the access tariff to meet additional commitments of 
cost recovery, such as stranded generation costs

Allocation of generation costs  
With an energy market 

 The rules of the wholesale energy market guide the 
definition of the generation charges 
 STMC: Energy market price €/kWh 
 Estimation of the energy market price for the time period of interest, 
divided into time zones as needed  
 Capacity charge (if any)   €/kW 
 Additional charges (in case the regulator has authorized some 
transitory additional charges to recover any stranded generation 
costs) 

34 

17 

Allocation of generation costs  
With an energy market 

  Difficulties: 
1.  Computation of the short-term marginal costs 
 Even if a wholesale energy market exists, it may not have 
an explicit mechanism of matching demand & supply bids 
(e.g. NETA in UK) or the mechanism may be a complex one 
  Then it is needed an explicit computation of the hourly (time zone) 
energy prices 
  The ex ante computation of tariffs requires an estimation of supply & 
demand for the time period of interest 

35 

Allocation of generation costs  
With an energy market 

2.  Capacity payment 
 Some systems have adopted regulatory measures to 
promote an adequate level of reliability in the supply of 
generation to the market  
  In most cases these measures require to pay an extra amount to 
generators in €/kW of “firm” installed capacity (i.e. that capacity that 
contributes to the reliability of the system) 
  The design of tariffs requires to find some criterion to allocate these 
generation costs to consumers 
• 
According to the contribution of the demand of each time zone to the 
reliability of the system (probability of loss of load) 

36

Allocation of generation costs  
With an energy market 
3.  Additional component 
 This component is very much dependent on the regulatory 
framework 
  In California or Spain, in the initial years after 
liberalization this corresponded to the stranded 
generation costs component  
  Possibilities of allocation of this cost to consumers 
•  A fixed amount per consumer 
•  A uniform % on the remaining tariff for each consumer 
•  Ramsey pricing (second best efficiency, although it may be 
considered to be discriminatory) 
  Typically this will be a component of the access charge 
(see later) 
37 

Allocation of generation costs  
Without an energy market 
 Even if there is no wholesale energy market, it 
is recommended to act in an identical way 
 It is therefore necessary to address the same 
three tasks (where now the three components will be 
required to cover the cost-of-service): 
 Computation of the expected short term marginal 
cost of generation 
 Capacity payment 
 Revenue reconciliation

 Step 2. Assign each cost component 
 Generation 
 Network & other costs 
 Step 3. Compute tariffs for end users 

39 

Assign (network + other regulated) 
costs to each time zone 
 These are access tariffs to distribution & 
transmission networks 
 They include the incurred network costs plus other 
unavoidable regulated charges 
 Charges must recover all regulated costs that can be 
attributed to each voltage level 
 Charges will be different according to voltage level, 
consumer type and time zone (typically there is no 
geographical differentiation inside a given distribution utility; 
locational differentiation is sometimes used in transmission) 

40 

20 

Considered costs 
 Identify all regulated costs to be considered: 
 Total transmission costs  
 Total distribution costs 
 Some unavoidable commercialization costs 
 Costs of institutions (OM, OS, Regulator) 
 Depending on the country 
 Stranded costs (generation, typically) 
 Subsidies to renewable energy sources 
 Other  costs  (support  to  nuclear  industry,  compensations 
to islands, etc) 

41 

Network costs 
  Distinguish between dedicated costs 
(connection charges, either shallow or deep 
charges) & common network costs 
  Standard network connection costs 
  Fixed charge per consumer under normal conditions 
  Special charges for special requests (e.g. Large distances) 
  Common network costs 
  To be allocated to voltage levels & time zones 

42 

21 

Summary 
Assign common network costs 

 Split network costs by voltage level 
 For each voltage level: 
 Split the network cost into a capacity & an energy 
component using principle of cost causality (use experts’ opinion on  
allocation of responsibilities in network investment) 
 Split the capacity & the energy cost component into time 
zones (use experts’ opinion on  allocation of responsibilities in network 
investment or just capacity to peak time zone & energy pro rata) 
 Compute the per unit cost of capacity & energy for the 
network at each voltage level & time zone 
 Compute the per unit cost of capacity & energy for each 
type of consumer & time zone 

45

each time zone: Details 
A. For each considered voltage level and a given year 
 Determine the total network cost 
 For each time zone h: 
 Determine the aggregated load & generation 
 Determine the equivalent demand (see figure) 
 Determine the network losses 
 Split network cost & losses into a total load charge & a 
total generation charge 
 Compute loss factors, to be used later to 
•  modify loads connected at different voltage levels so that 
they can be compared in the allocation of network costs at 
a given voltage level 
•  modify energy charges so that incurred losses are paid for 
46 

23 

(clarification note) 
How to compute & use loss factors? 

For each voltage level 
 Start from losses Lvt in voltage level v and time zone h 
 Allocate  Lvh  between  generation  and  aggregated  demand 
(connected at v plus equivalent from lower levels) in v  
 Compute the loss factor fvh for demand 
Lvh = fvh . (aggregated demand in v) 
 Move the aggregated demand in v to the next upper level 
(1 + fvh) . (aggregated demand in v) 
 and so on, until the transmission level is reached 

47

each time zone: Details 

B. Split the total network cost of a voltage level into a 
capacity & an energy component (principle of cost causality) 
 Capacity charge ($/kW) 
 Minimum fraction of the network that is needed to meet 
the peak load under normal & any specified contingency 
conditions 
 Energy charge ($/kWh) 
 accounts for the fraction of the network that is needed to 
optimize the equilibrium of investment vs. losses and non-
served energy costs  
 energy consumption gives information on peak demand & 
energy profile for consumers with only-energy metering & 
a contract for maximum capacity

C. Allocate the capacity & energy cost components of each 
voltage level to each time zone 
  Capacity charge ($/kW): 
  Allocate the capacity fraction of the network costs 
of a voltage level v to the time zone with peak 
demand 
  Energy charge ($/kWh): 
  Allocate to the time zones pro rata to the energy 
demand for each zone (other less linear criteria 
may be feasible) 

49 

Assign common network costs to 
each time zone: Details 

D.   Compute the per unit cost of capacity and energy for 
the network at each voltage level & time zone 
  Per unit capacity charge: Divide the capacity 
charge for the network at that voltage level by the 
peak equivalent demand for that level (same for other 
non-peak time zones, if necessary) 
  Per unit energy charge: Divide the energy 
charge for the network at that voltage level and 
time zone by the energy corresponding to that time 
zone

Assign common network costs to 
each time zone: Details 
E.  Compute the per unit cost of capacity & energy for each 
type of consumer & time zone 
  It is assumed that each consumer only uses the network at 
the voltage level where it is connected plus all networks at 
higher voltages 
  Capacity charge: Accumulate the per unit capacity charges 
for all corresponding voltage levels, while taking into account 
 
the aggregated load profile of the consumer type 
 
the effect of losses when moving between voltage levels 
  Energy charge: Accumulate the per unit energy charges for 
all corresponding voltage levels, while taking into account 
 
the aggregated load profile of the consumer type 
 
the effect of losses when moving between voltage levels 

51 

Allocation of other regulated costs 

OTHER COSTS 
  Commercialization costs 
  These are regulated costs (meant for regulated tariffs) 
  Recommended: Annual charge per consumer of each type 
  The cost of institutions (SO, MO, Regulator) 
  Recommended: % on final tariffs 
  For OM & OS some fraction may depend on the volume of activity 
  Other costs 
  Ramsey-like pricing may be an interesting option 
  However, this requires some crude estimation of the elasticities of 
consumers

by adding the fixed, energy & capacity components 
separately for each component of the total cost & each 
time zone

54 

27 

Computation of end-use tariffs 
B.  It is necessary to adapt the per unit charges for each 
consumer type according to its tariff structure 
  Make use of averages or aggregation whenever the tariff 
structure must be simplified 
  Whenever convenient, extend the tariff structure by making 
use of utilization factors (in order to avoid cross-subsidies 
among consumers under the same tariff but with different 
utilization factors) 
  Very short utilization factor (similar to back-up service) 
  Short 
  Intermediate 
  High
