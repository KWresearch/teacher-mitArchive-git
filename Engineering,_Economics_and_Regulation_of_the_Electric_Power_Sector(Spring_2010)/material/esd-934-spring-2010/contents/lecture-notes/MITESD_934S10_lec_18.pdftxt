Electricity retail market:  
The basics

 5

Supply (retail): The basics

•  Supply: Buy wholesale & sale electricity to end consumers
–  Generators could sell energy directly  suppliers are 
intermediaries
–  Narrow proﬁt margins (typically) but large volumes
–  Various formats of supply
•  Competitive, Regulated, Default tariffs
•  & different kinds of intermediation: retailers, traders, brokers
–  Also: just electricity vs. multi-utilities
–  In most markets the supply activity has been gradually 
liberalized (progressive eligibility of consumers)
–  The convenience of extending eligibility to all consumers has 
been frequently questioned

 9 

Supply: The technical processes (1)

•  Some are common to regulated & competitive supply (e.g. 
metering), others are required to change supplier
•  Customer database
–  Consumer data are typically collected & controlled by the 
incumbent distributor
–  This provides a commercial advantage to the retailer that is 
associated to that distributor, although in most jurisdictions 
the information has to be shared with any competing retailer
–  An option that has been adopted in some systems (e.g. UK, 
Spain) is an independent agency that centralized all the 
information & controls/performs the switching process

 10 

Supply: The technical processes (2)

•  Metering equipment & load proﬁles
–  The “obvious” solution: Hourly meters
•  Are they economically justiﬁed for small consumers?
–  The crude but pragmatic solution: Load proﬁles (representing 
the “normal” consumption pattern of a class of consumers)
•  Result in cross-subsidies among consumers
•  Suppliers may take advantage (cherry picking, if better metering is 
then used)
•  Loss of efﬁcient economic signals
•  Static (not updated) versus dynamic proﬁles (adjusted using real 
time data)
•  Need for reconciliation of total load with standard proﬁles & 
actual aggregated demand  delays in deﬁnitive billing

 11 

Supply: The technical processes (3)

•  Billing & collection
–  Billing: compute charges & issue the bill
–  Diversity of markets and market prices plus existence of 
hourly meters  large volume of information to handle
–  Actual processes of billing & collection are equivalent to the 
traditional approach
•  Other services
–  Energy-related advice or support
–  Multi-utility offerings
–  Improvement of metering or control equipment

 12 

Supply: Energy purchases & sales (1)

The analysis to be performed by the supplier:
•  Customer analysis: Obtain load to be supplied
–  It may be given by the sales contract itself
–  Alternatively, demand estimates may be needed (based on 
historical data or on in-depth customerʼs activity analysis)
•  Energy cost analysis
–  Once demand to be supplied is forecast  estimate the 
market price (in general a basket of prices) & the corresponding 
purchase costs
 Risks & risk hedging for suppliers

 13 

Supply: Energy purchases & sales (2)

•  Risks & risk hedging for suppliers
–  Price risk (difference between estimated price & actual price): 
Hedge by contracting with generators (or own generators)  
reﬂect the incurred risk in sale price
–  Quantity risk (difference between estimated demand & actual 
demand, in volume or proﬁle): This risk is typically passed to 
large consumers, but it is not currently possible for small 
ones
–  Collection risk (the buyer may not pay): Ask for some type of 
guarantee
–  Regulatory risk (arbitrariness of regulator): Send regulator to a 
good training course

Open issues in electricity retail 
Electricity pricing & electricity 
tariffs

For an excellent discussion on electricity prices see “Dynamic pricing, 
advanced metering & demand response in electricity markets”, S. 
Borenstein et al, CSEM WP 105, October 2002

 15 

The regulated tariffs 
The default tariff (1 of 5)
•  How is procured the electricity that is sold by the retailers 
to the consumers at a regulated tariff? This is typically 
speciﬁed by the regulator
–  Option 1: From the spot market (typically hourly prices of day-
ahead market, as initially in California or Spain) 
–  Option 2: From competitive procurement in different 
processes, typically public auctions
•  e.g., more than 40% of US states require competitive 
procurement to ensure that utilities provide cost-effective retail 
services (see “Competitive procurement of retail electricity 
supply: Recent trends in state policies & utility practices”, 
Analysis Group, July 2008; see next slide)

The regulated tariffs 
The default tariff (2 of 5)
(cont.)
–  Option 3: Any prescribed mix of 1 & 2
–  Option 4: The regulated retailer may have degrees of 
freedom in the procurement
•  In order to incentivise an efﬁcient procurement, the regulator 
may acknowledge as regulated cost x% of the actual purchase 
costs of the retailer & 100-x% of the average purchase cost of 
all retailers (as in The Netherlands)

 18 

The regulated tariffs 
The default tariff (3 of 5)

•  Retail competition & the potential interference from 
default tariffs
–  Default integral tariffs are at least needed when there are not 
enough bidders to supply some consumer groups (perhaps 
only in certain areas)
–  Default tariffs protect consumers who have high transaction 
costs to change supplier
–  Unless there is a complete pass-through of the energy 
market price (or an equivalent risk hedge) the default tariffs 
may unfairly compete with retailers

 19 

The regulated tariffs 
The default tariff (4 of 5)
•  To avoid interferences of any default tariff on retail 
competition  the basic rule is the pass-through of the 
energy market price to the default tariff
–  How to deﬁne the price of energy in the default tariff? 
•  From any prescribed combination of purchases with 
transparent transactions in the long-term &/or short-term
•  Any incentives to purchase wholesale energy efﬁciently?
–  Is an extra charge justiﬁed in the default tariff to promote 
the change of supplier?
–  If a transition period between old & new default tariffs is 
needed  manage to maintain a level playing ﬁeld between 
default tariff & market prices during the entire transition

 20 

The regulated tariffs 
The default tariff (5 of 5)
•  Do consumers need extra protection? Is it reasonable 
that the regulator establishes conditions that limit the 
clauses that are freely agreed in a private contract?
•  Maximum duration (e.g. one year)?
•  Freedom to cancel a contract (such as the 28-day rule in the UK 
allowing consumers to cancel any contract with 28 days notice) 
without any charges?
•  May these “protection measures” backﬁre?

 21 

The regulated tariffs 
The last resort tariff (1 of 2)
•  The need to deﬁne a “last resort tariff” as different from the 
“default tariff”
–  The “default tariff” is an option that the regulator decides to 
keep available for those consumers who do not want to 
bother to search for a retailer, or as a protection against 
insufﬁcient competition from the supply side, or to protect 
any energy-poor consumers
•  It may exist or not
–  The “last resort tariff” is the regulated tariff that is assigned to 
the consumers whose retailer disappears (typically because 
of bankruptcy) and they have to be transferred to or ﬁnd 
another retailer
•  It has to exist anyway

 22 

The regulated tariffs 
The last resort tariff (2 of 2)
•  The existence of the last resort tariff should be mandatory, at least for 
small & medium consumers
•  Meaningful approaches
–  Since the new retailer adquires an unexpected obligation & it will 
have to purchase additional energy on short notice  this tariff will 
typically be higher than the default tariff and it will be typically 
computed when needed, not in advance
–  The procedure has to be completely speciﬁed a priori
•  Whether the consumers may choose supplier by themselves 
individually & when, if this is the case (note that a larger portfolio of 
consumers can normally be allocated to other retailer at a better price)
•  The last resort tariff may last for a limited period of time, after which 
the individual consumers may wish to stay (at the default tariff) or to 
leave for another supplier
•  An ex ante auction may decide which retailer will be the last resort 
retailer in any given zone in case it is needed

 23 

Competitive retailing 
Electricity prices (1 of 4)
Static prices (prices change infrequently):
•  Flat rate (prescribed uniform price per kWh)
–  The supplier absorbs the full risk of market price uncertainty 
(assuming purchase price is not hedged)
–  Frequently used with small consumers
–  It may include a capacity ($/kW) component, applied to the 
amount of contracted capacity (this concept does not even exist 
in many countries)
•  Time-of-Use (ToU) prices (a long time in advance prices are 
pre-set for predetermined time periods)
–  Same as above; the economic signals to consumers are 
better, although they may deviate signiﬁcantly from reality

 24 

Competitive retailing 
Electricity prices (2 of 4)
Dynamic pricing (prices can change on short notice):
•  Critical peak pricing (CPP) (the retailer can occasionally 
declare an unusually high retail price for a limited number of hours)
–  CPP is able to send economic signals that correspond to 
actual instances of scarcity of production in the power 
system
•  Real-time pricing (RTP) (charge the actual price of each hour to 
the actual consumption in that hour)

•  ToU, CPP & RTP require increasingly more sophisticated 
electricity meters

• 

Competitive retailing 
Electricity prices (3 of 4)
Pricing schemes with discounts to provide reliability 
services:
Interruptible rates (the utility may interrupt the service to 
consumers with these tariffs within a short notice and up to a 
maximum number of times per year)
•  Real-time Demand-reduction programs (the utility may 
contact the consumer to offer a payment in return for the consumer 
reducing consumption below a prescribed baseline)
•  Participation of demand in forward capacity markets
–  The case of ISO New England
•  Note that this is different from “demand side bidding”, which is a typical 
feature of wholesale markets

 25 

 26 

Competitive retailing 
Electricity prices (4 of 4)
RTP pricing schemes with hedging mechanisms:
•  Two-part RTP programs with a customer baseline load 
(CBL)
–  There is a Contract for Differences (CfD) for a  baseline 
consumption (agreed with the regulator) at a regulated price 
(some ToU price, for instance)
–  In parallel the consumer is fully exposed to RTP for the entire 
demand
•  Two-part RTP with build-your-own (BYO) baseline load
–  Same as above, but the consumer fully decides how much 
demand he wants to hedge

Open issues in electricity retail 
Independent versus vertically 
integrated retailers

 27 

 28 

Open issues 
Retailers with or w/o own generation

•  The difﬁcult life of the independent (i.e. without own 
generation) retailer
–  Provider of some useful services: liquidity, arbitrage, risk 
hedging instruments, tailor-made tariffs (instead of all-purpose 
default tariffs) or contracts, additional services (efﬁciency audits 
& advice, sales of appliances, etc.)
–  Extra difﬁculties in risk hedging & often discriminatory 
treatment in market rules (e.g. operating reserves, balancing)
–  Questionable survival (why not the generator?)

Open issues in electricity retail 
Is competitive retail justiﬁed 
for small consumers?

 29 

 30 

Is retail justiﬁed for small consumers?

•  Retail competition for small consumers: is it worth it?
–  Retail competition versus well designed (even including some 
risk hedging) default retail tariffs
•  While default tariffs must adopt a given general structure, 
retailers may offer ad hoc risk hedging structures that are best 
suited to each end consumer and also additional services
–  Small potential savings
–  Smaller consumers are less price responsive
–  Metering & billing costs are not negligible compared to 
savings & they become a complex task
–  Without hourly meters (& the use of proﬁles) gross errors will 
happen in settlement for individual consumers
–  The threat of arbitrage stimulates retail competition

 31 

Is retail justiﬁed for small consumers?

•  Pros & cons of extending retail competition also to small 
consumers (including domestic consumers) are well 
presented in the papers by Stephen Littlechild & Paul 
Joskow in the reading material (Stellar site).
–  A simpliﬁed version of the debate, as well as a proposal, can 
be found in the paper by C. Vázquez et al., also in Stellar

 32 

Open issues in electricity retail 
Hurdles to retail competition

 33 

Hurdles to retail competition (1)

• 

Interference of default retail tariffs
–  Tariffs below (also above, to promote that consumers may go to 
the market) market prices
•  For large industrial consumers
•  For other consumers
–  Unfair ex post adjustments to tariffs (as in the allocation of the 
“tariff deﬁcit” in Spain: ﬂat allocation to all consumers)
•  Lack of adequate procedures to switch supplier
–  Insufﬁcient development of procedures to exchange 
information between distributor & retailers
–  Lack of precision in the speciﬁcation of deadlines in the 
required tasks in the switching process
–  Abusive commercial practices by retailers when trying to get 
new customers

 34 

Hurdles to retail competition (2)

• 

Irregular practices that are possible by an insufﬁcient 
unbundling of distribution & retailing
–  Asymmetry in the access to commercial information of 
consumers by all retailers
–  Publicity or commercial offers that make use of services by 
other companies within the same holding
–  The use of quality of service of distribution as a commercial 
advantage
•  Sometimes just a threat, but also actual ex post discriminatory 
practices
•  Abusive practices in the procedure to sign the contract 
for access to the distribution grid
–  New requirements regarding the contracted capacity or 
others
–  Request of ﬁnancial guarantees

 35 

Hurdles to retail competition (3)

•  Discriminatory practices in relation with renting, 
installation & maintenance of metering equipment
–  New requirements because of the change of supplier
–  Impediments to the customer to access the information in its 
own meter
–  Excessive charges for the metering service
•  Anomalies in the process of invoicing
•  Discriminatory charges (for instance: reactive power)

 36 

Hurdles to retail competition (4)

• 

Inertia of the consumers (ﬁdelity to traditional brands or previous 
supplier  not a “regulatory” issue)
•  Common ownership of gas & electricity distribution 
networks (to be developed next)
•  Demand-side management (DSM) could be a component 
of retail competition (which would then encompass a wider range of 
activities), however
–  lack of incentives to promote an active demand participation
–  & inadequate regulation & metering to promote DSM activities

 37 

(ﬁrmer conclusions would require further examination of case studies) 
Issues in joint retailing of gas & electricity

•  When choosing supplier, electricity consumers seem to 
have a preference for their electricity distribution 
company &, in 2nd place, for their gas distribution 
company. Same with gas retailing
•  Most competition happens between the distributors of 
gas & electricity
•  When ownership of gas & electricity distribution 
networks overlaps, retail competition weakens
•  The prestige of the brand is a strong factor in retail 
competition

 38 

Open issues in electricity retail 
Unbundling distribution & retail

 39 

Unbundling distribution & retail (1 of 3)

•  Many problems with retail competition would disappear 
with the ownership unbundling of distribution + DSO & 
retail (in general not an easy measure to apply)
•  Assuming that only legal unbundling exists, the 
following regulatory measures should at least be adopted
–  Legal unbundling of the normal retailer from the distributor 
(& any retailer-for-tariff-customers that may exist)
–  Minimum quality standards in attention to customers by 
the distribution companies (on top of the usual minimum 
standards of quality of service)
–  Clear deﬁnition of the responsibility of the activity of 
metering the demand of end consumers (e.g. frequently 
assigned to the distribution company)

 40 

Unbundling distribution & retail (2 of 3)
(continuation)
–  Clear procedures of access to commercial information 
about consumers by all existing retailers
•  At least: decentralized scheme whereby all retailers have 
equal access to the same basic information
•  Otherwise: centralized switching agency (disadvantage: new 
institution & extra costs)
–  Clear procedures to switch supplier with speciﬁed 
deadlines
•  If it does not work in a decentralized format  centralized 
switching agency
•  Use ad hoc rules to prevent gaming by consumers with 
opportunistic switching (taking advantage of different prices at 
different times of the year & imperfect contracts or default tariffs)

 41 

Unbundling distribution & retail (3 of 3)

(continuation)
–  Strict supervision by regulatory agency
•  Irregular practices by retailers & distributors should be banned 
& prosecuted
–  More drastic measures have been proposed &/or tried in 
some systems
•  Consumers cannot choose the supplier that belongs to the 
same holding as the corresponding distribution company
•  Retailing-to-tariff-consumers could be auctioned to retailers 
other than the one associated to the corresponding distribution 
company
•  And, ﬁnally, ownership unbundling of distribution & retailing

 42 

The ownership of customer information

•  Who owns / controls / has access to the consumer 
database?
–  Design options: Centralized, with an independent 
administrator, versus administered by the incumbent 
distributor or another local entity
•  Key issue 1: whether data have to be transferred between 
databases or stay where they are & just change the supplierʼs 
name
•  Key issue 2: prevent supplier malpractices (enlist consumers 
or keeping them without their explicit consent)
•  Key issue 3: whether meter reading is required when supplier 
changes (to prevent gaming by consumers)

 43 

The EU approach 
Unbundling requirements in the EU Directive

•  Directives 2003/54/EC (electricity) & 2003/55/EC (gas) 
require the distribution system operator (DSO) to be 
independent (at least legally, in the organization & decision-making) 
of any other activity in the respective sector
•  The solution commonly adopted has been to legally 
unbundle any kind of retailing from distribution, which 
retains the DSO function
•  Does legal separation provide the adequate level of 
independence of the supply activity, therefore 
guaranteeing against the risk of discrimination of 
competing suppliers?

 44 

Open issues in electricity retail 
Demand response and 
advanced metering

 45 

Towards an active demand participation

•  Regulation should 
–  Promote the active participation of demand in energy 
markets
•  with adequate pricing schemes
•  and other direct procedures
–  encourage retailers to engage into demand-side 
management (DSM) activities
•  Most of these activities require advanced metering
–  Careful speciﬁcation, planning & standardization are needed, 
before massive deployment
–  Look for ﬂexibility in the adaptation to any future requests & 
technological progress (e.g. making use of Internet) rather than 
deploying very smart but inﬂexible meters

 46 

Open issues in electricity retail 
The role of retailers in energy 
efﬁciency programs

 47 

Role of retailers in efﬁciency programs (1 of 2)

–  Although, in principle, it should be enough if all consumers 
could experiment energy market prices in real time (either 
directly, via contracts or under default tariffs)
–  However, there are several shortcomings
•  Market prices do not reﬂect the true cost of electricity & 
gas (most externalities are ignored: diverse environmental impacts, 
long-term scarcity of resources, inequalities in energy access)
•  Poor design of access tariffs & default integral tariffs
•  Lack of advanced metering systems
•  Short-term energy prices are not experienced by most 
consumers

 48 

Role of retailers in efﬁciency programs (2 of 2)

(cont.)
 Additional measures are necessary
•  Promote existence of energy service companies, 
whose business is energy efﬁciency, without conﬂicts of 
interest
•  Direct demand-side measures (standards, command & 
control, publicity of efﬁcient appliances, direct control of appliances 
by utility, interruptibility contracts, etc.)
– With the support of advanced metering & tarifﬁcation 
schemes
•  Interesting experiences using market-based mechanisms
–  White certiﬁcates (e.g. Italy, France)
–  Energy efﬁciency resource standards (EERS) in the US

Open issues in electricity retail 
Other open issues

 49 

 50 

Other open issues

•  How to protect the “fuel poor”? The difﬁcult design of 
social tariffs
•  Are there any signiﬁcant synergies in combining 
distribution & retailing of gas & electricity?
Is switching a good measure of success in retail 
competition?
–  Perhaps more effective as a threat than as a fact

• 

Regulatory support to retail 
competition

 51 

 52 

Regulatory support to retail competition

•  Main factors for the success of retail competition
–  Functioning & reliable wholesale market
–  Easy access by consumers to information about the 
available choices, their pros & cons, & the procedures to 
switch supplier
–  True competition among suppliers without signiﬁcant barriers 
or discrimination
–  Absence of default tariffs or other regulated options that 
compete with advantage with retailers
–  Adequate metering equipment & data processing to support 
market transactions
–  Working institutions to protect consumer rights & to curb 
irregular commercial practices
–  Complete, correct & stable set of rules
