Principles of  microeconomics 
Application to power systems 
Prof. Ignacio J. Pérez-Arriaga 
 

 

What do we want to know? 
 How basic microeconomic principles translate 
into electricity markets?  
 How is the price of electricity determined in a 
competitive market context?  
 Are all the generation costs completely 
recovered in a competitive electricity market? 
Identify reasons for mismatches in cost 
recovery 
 Study relationships between short and long 
term marginal costs and optimal wholesale 
electricity prices

peaker) 
 Under a traditional regulatory framework 
 Centralized investment planning & economic generation 
dispatch

Example 
Description of a power system 
 The data 
 3 generation technologies:  
 Base-loaded, e.g. N (nuclear) 
 Mid-range, e.g. C (coal) 
 Peaker, e.g.  F (fuel-oil) 
 per unit ($/kW) fixed costs: FN, FC, FF 
 per unit ($/kWh) variable costs: VN, VC, VF 
 cost of non-served energy: VP 
 The unknowns 
 installed capacities: KN, KC, KF 
 energy generated: EN, EC, EF 
 non-served energy: EP

Example 
The strategy to be followed 
 Start with an ideal welfare maximization 
model for electricity supply & consumption 
 Then analyze a Traditional electricity company 
model that is regulated so that welfare 
maximization is achieved 
  Centralized decisions of the company to meet demand 
 Then analyze a Market model 
  Decentralized decisions by all market agents 
 Compare the expected outcome of the traditional 
& market models against the benchmark welfare 
maximization model & draw conclusions

Centralized investment & operation 
The optimization model 
 Maximize social welfare: 
surplus of consumers + surplus of suppliers = 
= (utility to consumers – electricity acquisition cost) + 
+ (sales revenues - supply cost) = 
= utility to consumers - supply cost 
 Pragmatic proxy (given low elasticity of demand to price): 
minimize an “extended” supply cost =  
= supply cost + cost of any non-served energy 
(therefore explicitly including estimated costs of non-supplied 
load, which is the negative component of the utility to 
consumers)

Centralized investment & operation 
The optimization model 

 Assumptions: 
 Static planning model (just one future horizon 
year) 
 Continuous variables (investment costs, 
connection costs, no technical minima) 
 Deterministic production cost model 
 Constant fixed & variable costs (do not depend on 
volume of investments or production level)

Centralized investment & operation 
The optimization model 

 Supply cost minimization problem: 

 where the variables are: KN, KC, KF, EN, EC, EF, EP 

 The production cost problem can be solved by inspection 
of the figure in next page: EN, EC, EF & EP are trivially 
obtained from the figure once KN, KC & KF are known 
 If there are economies of scale, fixed costs are a function 
of the installed capacity: CFN(KN), CFC(KC), CFF(KF) 
11 

Centralized investment & operation 
The solution (graphically) 

Load / duration curve and utilization 
factors for each technology: 
UN = 1; UC = U(KN); UF = U(KN+KC); 
UP = U(KN+KC+KF) 

K= installed capacity 
U= utilization factor

Optimality conditions for each technology:

If no economies of scale, then all CF functions are linear, with constant derivatives  

Centralized investment & operation 
The solution (analytically) 

 Optimality conditions in terms of competition 
between pairs of technologies: 
 Nuclear vs. Coal: 
 FN + VN*UC = FC + VC * UC 
 Coal vs. Fuel-oil: 
 FC + VC*UF = FF + VF*UF 
 Fuel-oil vs. unserved energy: 
 FF + VF*UP = VP*UP 
 which have a direct graphical interpretation

Centralized investment & operation 
Short & long-term marginal costs 
 Within the traditional framework of centralized 
planning & operation 
 Long-term marginal cost 
 Additional total cost of supplying one more unit of 
demand, when evaluated in the long-term (includes 
investment & operation costs) 
 Short-term marginal cost 
 Additional total cost of supplying one more unit of 
demand, when evaluated in the short-term (includes only 
operation costs of existing facilities)

Centralized investment & operation 
Short & long-term marginal costs 
 Assume 
 optimal investments  capacity is perfectly 
adapted to demand 
 optimal operation  minimum costs of meeting 
demand (including costs of non-served energy) 
with the existing capacity 
 then 

long-term marginal cost =

 Proof of the equality of SMC & LMC 
 The conditions of optimality of investments and 
operation are required for the proof 
LMC = FN + VN =

= FF + (VF - VC).UF + (VC - VN).UC + VN = 
= (VP -VF).UP + (VF -VC).UF * (VC -VN).UC + VN = 
=UP.VP+(UF-UP).VF+(UC-UF).VC+(1-UC).VN =

Market-based regulatory framework 
The individual supply firm 

 At a given time, there are two decision 
variables (interdependent) of firm i with a 
total production cost TCi(Qi): 
 produced quantity Qi 
 selling price Pi (may be an exogenous input) 
 Goal of firm i: profit maximization 
max Pi.Qi - TCi(Qi) 

23 

Market-based regulatory framework 
Supply characterization 

 Generation firms 
 When many units (optimally sized) of each technology 
are needed & much new investment is needed to meet 
demand growth  no economies of scale  
 per unit fixed supply costs do not depend on the volume of 
new investment (when it is much larger than the optimal unit 
size) 
 marginal & average long-term supply costs are equal 
 and at every level (e.g. peak, shoulder, off-peak) of 
demand competition can exist 

24

Market-based regulatory framework  
Demand characterization 

D(P): Response of demand D to price P as external input  

25 

Market-based regulatory framework  
Perfectly competitive market 
 Characterization 
 Many small (compared to market size) supply firms 
that provide the same product  none can control 
market price P 
 No entry cost or barriers to entry 
 Strategy of firm: max profit  produce Qi while 
marginal cost MCi(Qi) ≤ P  
 At a given time, P results from the intersection of the demand 
curve P(Q) and the aggregated supply curve (cid:1028)Qi(P)=Q(P) 
 Firms who loose, exit the market; if firms make extra profits 
there will be new entrants  all remaining firms just recover 
costs (including reasonable return on investment)

The classical static representation of a perfectly competitive market 
(without economies of scale in supply), where no distinction is made 
between the long & short terms (not of much use in electricity markets) 

No economies of scale in supply  uniform supply cost 

Example (cont.) 
Perfectly competitive market (1) 

  Under perfect competition fuel-oil generators bid their 
marginal costs & are paid the market marginal price & must 
have zero net profits 

revenues: VP.UP.KF 
costs: FF.KF+VF.UP.KF 
 Since, under perfect competition, there is no margin for extra 
profit  

net profit = (VP - VF).UP.KF - FF.KF = 0 

 Note that this is the same optimality condition of the 
centralized traditional approach  under the assumed 
idealized conditions, both regulatory approaches (centralized 
& competitive) result in the same investment for each 
technology) 

28 

14 

Example (cont.) 
Perfectly competitive market (2) 
 Implications: 
 Under perfect competition in technology F the 
volume of investment in F coincides with the 
result under central planning 
 Under perfect competition the fixed & variable 
costs of technology F are exactly recovered (zero 
extra profit) if volume of investment in F is optimal 
 The above result holds irrespective whether 
investments in N or C are optimal or not (but, in 
general, the optimal investment for a technology k depends on the 
actual investments of other technologies) 

29 

Market models 
Non regulated monopoly 
 Characterization 
 Single supplier for the entire market 
 exclusive franchise or a natural monopoly 
 No competitors may enter the market 
 Freedom to set the selling price (not a given input now) 
 Strategy of firm: max profit  produce Q while 
marginal revenue MR(Q) > marginal cost MC(Q), but 
charge the maximum price P(Q) that the demand 
can accept  monopoly withholds demand to 
increase price 
 Note: marginal revenue MR=d/d(Q) [P(Q).Q]=P+Q.dP/dQ<P  
 where  P(Q) is given by the demand curve

The classical static representation of a perfectly competitive market 
(without economies of scale in supply), where no distinction is made 
between the long & short terms (not of much use in electricity markets) 

No economies of scale in supply  uniform supply cost 

Example (cont.) 
Non regulated monopoly 
 Strategy of a monopoly of the fuel-oil technology: 
maximize net benefit NBF= (VP -VF).UP.KF - FF.KF 
        = 0 = (VP-VF).UPnew+(VP-VF).KF.       -FF 
  FF = (VP-VF).UPnew+(VP-VF).KF. 
 Comparison with the condition characterizing the 
competitive market (& centralized planning): 
FF = (VP-VF).UP 
 Since        <0  UPnew>UP  the monopoly 
   withholds production (investment) 
Another possible strategy of the monopolist would be to raise prices up to VP 

32 

16 

Market models 
Oligopoly 
 In an oligopolistic market 
 some firms have market power  the price setters, who 
have some control on market price 
 remaining firms are price takers 
 Price setter i decides price Pi & quantity Qi based on 
the assessment of 
 its own impact 
 the expected behavior of competitors 
 Diverse available alternative models to understand & 
to evaluate oligopolies  results are intermediate 
between competition & non regulated monopoly 

33 

Market power 

 Market power: the ability of a firm or a group 
of firms to modify prices from the competitive 
level for its own benefit 
 the standard for the normal price is the 
competitive equilibrium price 
 market power depends on the structure, not on 
the rules in a competitive market

Always remember that ... 

“When structure is not conducive to 
competition, the regulator and pool operator 
will find themselves unsuccessfully chasing 
after conduct. The solution is not a better 
rule, but a change in structure”(*)

Forms of market power 

 Vertical market power: when a firm, having a 
monopoly position in a regulated segment (e.g. 
transmission or distribution), is able to favour itself, or 
its affiliate, in a potentially competitive segment 
 Horizontal market power: when exercised within a 
potentially competitive segment (i.e. generation or 
supply), through the control of a substantial share of 
supply in the relevant market 
 Distinguish between the existence and the (ab)use of 
market power 
 Detection – more difficult than the definition 
 Remedies – more effective if structural 

37 

Detection of market power (1) 

 
 
 

  Analysis of market concentration 
 Herfindhal-Hirschman Index 
 
 HHI = (cid:1028)i (si)2  
 i = 1, …, N firms in the “relevant market”  
 si = market share of firm i 
 If N = 1 (monopoly) HHI = 10,000 
 If N tends to ∞ (atomistic competition) HHI tends to 0 
 Generally 
 HHI < 1,000 indicates adequate competition 
 
 
 HHI > 1,800 indicates inadequate competition 
  However 
 in highly contestable markets, large firms may not have 
significant (horizontal) market power 
  What is the relevant market? 
  Geographical dimension: grid constraints 
  Product dimension: capabilities of technologies, times of day 

38 

19 

Detection of market power (2) 

 Analysis of market prices 
 Lerner Index measures the mark-up of prices over 
marginal costs, as a percentage of prices (on the 
assumption that, in competition, prices equal 
marginal costs) 
   
 Lerner = (P – MC)/P 
 However: 
 difficulties in estimating costs and marginal costs 
accurately 
 prices higher than marginal costs may just signal 
scarcity (and may persist until new capacity enters 
in operation) 
39 

Market power 
Mitigation measures 
  Elasticity of demand 
  Avoidance of situations with scarcity of supply 
  Divestiture &/or virtual sales 
  Volume of forward contracts / bid caps 
  voluntary (not a real limitation factor) 
  mandatory (load to be supplied at a regulated price, mandatory 
volume of contracted capacity) 
  Recovery of stranded costs “by differences” have a similar effect 
  Uncertainty in demand 
  Long-term consequences 
  Contestability of new entrants 
  Demand elasticity (in the long-run) 
  Regulator response

Optimal marginal prices (cont. 1) 

Methodology: 
 Formulate the Lagrangian function & the 
corresponding optimality conditions for each 
optimization problem 
 Find (by observation) the market prices that 
result in identical optimality conditions  
same results for the optimization problems 

54

Competitive market model 
Optimal marginal prices (cont. 2) 
 Optimality requires the use of different market 
prices for the generation services provided 
at each time range 
 Price of generated energy 
 This is the marginal price of “the last unit in the merit 
order” of energy production 
 Price of operating reserves 
 Only if some security target (minimum requirement) is set 
by the System Operator 
 Price of available installed capacity 
 Only if some reliability target is set somehow

Competitive market model 
Optimal marginal prices (cont. 3) 
 Optimality requires the use of the following 
market price for consumption: 
marginal price of generated energy +  
+ marginal price of operating reserves + 
+ marginal price of available installed capacity 
 The last two terms only exist if security &/or 
reliability targets have been set by regulator &/or 
system operator  

57 

The traditional utility model 

 The welfare maximization model can be 
reformulated in a format suitable for traditional 
utility regulation 
MIN  { Total utility supply cost } 
subject to 
 Expansion constraints 
 Operation constraints 
where the cost of non-supplied energy must be 
included in the utility supply costs 

58 

29 

The traditional utility model 
Short & long term marginal costs 
STMC = Increment of total cost for a per unit increment 
in demand, with the existing installed capacity 
LTMC = Increment of total cost for a per unit increment 
in demand, with no restrictions on the existing installed 
capacity 
 LTMC is equal to STMC only if: 
 Installed capacity is optimal 
 There is no active reliability constraint 
 The same scenarios of uncertainty are considered 

59 

Cost recovery analysis 

If a technology (or power plant) is perfectly 
adapted: 
Marginal revenues + adjustment term  
= total generation supply cost 
Mismatches: 
 common constraints on installed capacity (e.g. 
exhausted technology) 
 internal constraints on installed capacity (e.g. Must 
build plant to burn waste) 
 economies of scale in production 

60 

30 

Marginal pricing of generation services 
The practice 
 STMC must be obtained  
 ex ante from an operation model  
 ex post from actual data of operation 
 Without inter-period couplings  STMC is the 
variable cost (bid price) of the last dispatched unit in 
economic merit order 
 Inter-period coupling requires accounting for 
 technical minima / start-up costs / unit commitment 
constraints (e.g. ramps) / hydro-thermal coordination
