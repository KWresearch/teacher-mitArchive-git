The electricity crisis of California 
•  Low hydraulicity 
•  Climate 
•  High Demand 

Lack of 
generation 

•  Natural Gas 
•  SDG & E 
•  NOx 
•  PG & E, SCE 

•  High prices 
•  Rationing 

Bankruptcy 

•  Regulatory uncertainty        
(responsibility not clear)

ensure enough firm capacity

(CTC, contracts)

There are other explanations... 

 “The California crunch really is the 
result of not enough power-
generating plants and then not 
enough power to power the power of 
generating plants” 
 George.W. Bush (then President elect) 
 (Interview by the New York Times, January 14, 2001)

Regulatory U-Turn 

  2007 Nationwide survey confirmed dramatic reversal of 
support among state utility regulators for “deregulated” 
energy markets 
  One third of regulators in currently competitive states said 
they are seriously considering “re-regulating” utilities in their 
jurisdictions 
  Asked to identify states operating most successful 
deregulated energy markets, majority of commissioners 
replied, "None"  
  Survey found no measurable support among state regulators 
for any form of retail competition in foreseeable future 
 
 
 
 
  RKS Research & Consulting, 2007 

The “textbook model” 
of the restructured & 
liberalized power sector 

Some material for this section has been borrowed from S. Littlechild & P. Joskow in 
Electricity Market reform: An international perspective, Elsevier, 2006.

Components of the “textbook model” 
(the 10 commandments) 

  Privatization, to enhance performance & reduce 
the interference of the government 
  Vertical separation of competitive & regulated 
monopoly activities 
  Horizontal restructuring to create a level playing 
field for competition 
  Independent System Operator 
  Voluntary energy & ancillary services markets & 
trading arrangements 

11 

Components of the “textbook model” 
(the 10 commandments) 

(continuation) 
  Open access to the transmission network, plus 
adequate locational signals 
  Free choice of supplier with an adequate design & 
utilization of retail tariffs  
  Creation of independent regulatory agencies 
  Provision of transition mechanisms 
  … & nothing more!

… however, avoid “cut & paste” 

  Models which appear to work well in some 
circumstances & places may not be easily 
transferable to countries facing different 
circumstances 
 (peak load, level of development, industry initial 
structure & ownership, fuel mix, interconnections, 
institutional framework)

Successes… 

  Where the textbook model has been basically 
followed the new regulation has been quite 
successful 
 Nordic countries 
 UK 
 Argentina (before the country’s financial crisis) 
 Texas & Northeast of the US 
 Australia 

15 

… & failures 

  And where the textbook model has been abandoned 
because of omission or commission, there have been 
problems 
 Omission: France (no comprehensive wholesale market), 
Germany (lack of true open network access), New Zealand (no 
independent regulator), … 
 Commission: California (poor assignment of risk), Chile (pioneer 
but too restrictive market & transmission rules), Spain (too much 
governmental intervention & horizontal concentration), …

failures

“When structure is not conducive to 
competition, the regulator & pool 
operator will find themselves 
unsuccessfully chasing after conduct. 
The solution is not a better rule, but 
a change in structure”(*) 

(or a gradual introduction of competition, with rules that 
restrict the freedom of the market agents & prevent 
market power abuse) 

(*) From “Governance & regulation of power pools & system operators”, Barker, J., 
 Tenenbaum, B. & Woolf, F., World Bank, 1997.

Frequent failures 

  Inadequate sector structure for competition 
 Horizontal concentration 
 Insufficient vertical / diagonal unbundling 
 Generation & system operation  
 Distribution & retailing 
 Generation & retailing (¿?) 
  Incorrect risk allocation in the regulatory design 
 Default tariff design (pass through of costs to consumers) 
 Authorized trading instruments 
 Ultimate responsibility to supply 

Frequent failures 

(continuation) 
  Attempting to apply “textbook-like reforms” in 
countries without an appropriate power sector 
structure &/or an adequate institutional framework 
  No liquid &/or supra-national balancing markets 
  Insufficient competition in the markets for fuel 

19 

20 

10 

Frequent failures 

(continuation) 
  Absence of executive regional institutions 
in supra-national markets 
 Lack of needed harmonization 
 Inadequate cross-border trading rules 
  Scarce available commercial capacity of 
interconnectors 
 Physical capacity / long-term previous contracts
