Choices in wholesale market design 
Structure & governance 
List of topics: 
 Unbundling of activities 
 Horizontal concentration 
 Vertical integration 
 Risk allocation 
 Governance of market institutions 
 Role of competition authorities 
 A market within a wider market 
 The players & their environment 

Issues on structure & governance 
Vertical integration 
 Complete unbundling of generation/retailing from 
network activities 
 Avoid consolidation of vertical integration 
(generation & retail to captive consumers) via 
opaque physical bilateral contracts  
 separation of activities 
 public auctions to allocate the contracts 
 mandatory purchase from the pool 
 Diagonal integration (gas & electricity) 

9 

10 

5 

Issues on structure & governance 
Risk allocation 
 Rule: Improve efficiency by allocating to each 
agent only the risk he may handle 
 Case examples 
 risk of retailers for captive consumers largely 
depends on the mechanisms of pass-through of 
the pool price 
 The case of Argentina: no risk for retailer  no 
incentive to establish hedging contracts 
 The case of California: distributor/retailer was exposed 
to the full risk of market price volatility 
 Spain, The Netherlands: Use average purchasing cost 
rather than individual purchase cost 

11 

Issues on structure & governance 
Governance of market institutions 
 Basic issues 
 Independence of the market operator or power 
exchange (public or private) versus complete 
representation of the agents of the market, or 
maybe a hybrid 
 Allow flexibility & promote initiative to improve the 
rules (avoid deadlocks) 
 combine some self-governance with a 
regulatory backstop 

12 

6 

Market related institutions 
Case examples of unbundling 
 Typical EU  
 Market operator is named “Power Exchange” & it can be a 
public entity or privately owned establishing its own rules 
 Transmission System Operator: SO & transmission 
ownership, mostly independent 
 Transmission services: Other companies besides the TSO 
could provide these services, but it is not frequent 
 Typical US (under RTOs or ISOs) 
 Independent System Operator (ISO) performs functions of 
SO & Market Operator 
 Independent & it does not own transmission (nor generation or 
distribution) assetts 
 Diversity of transmission owners 

13 

Issues on structure & governance 
The role of competition authorities 

 Backstop to self-governance by market 
institutions; possibility of improving rules 
 Make sure that market information is 
facilitated to all interested parties on a non 
discriminatory basis 
 Expert market surveillance 
 Market power abuse 
 investigation of specific complaints 

14 

7 

Issues on structure & governance 
Always remember… 

“When structure is not conducive to 
competition, the regulator & pool operator will 
find themselves unsuccessfully chasing after 
conduct. The solution is not a better rule, but 
a change in structure”(*) 
(or a gradual introduction of competition, with rules that restrict 
the freedom of the market agents & prevent market power 
abuse) 

(*) From “Governance & regulation of power pools & system operators”, Barker, J., 
 Tenenbaum, B. & Woolf, F., World Bank, 1997.

A wide diversity of market models 

 The “mandatory pool” model 
 Simple or complex bids 
 Audited costs or free bids 
 Optional financial contracts 
 The “open trade” model 
 Bilateral contracts that typically coexist (not in 
the UK) with a PX offering an organized day-
ahead spot market & organized long-term 
contracts of different formats 
 All models include the SO providing (with or 
w/o ad hoc markets) operating reserves, 
network constraint management & some 
balancing mechanism

From commercial to physical (as 
the market gets closer to real time) 
  “Gate Closure” is the deadline for trading electricity to 
be delivered in a specified period 
  Gate Closure could be from one or more days to one 
hour or less before delivery time 
  By Gate Closure, balanced (injections and withdrawals) 
positions are declared (possibly through balance responsible 
agents) to the relevant TSO for scheduling (the PX may 
itself be a balance responsible agent) 
  At Gate Closure the TSO takes over the management 
of electricity flows over the network 
  Deviations of actual injections/withdrawals from 
positions attract imbalance charges and are settled 
with the TSO

Contracts 
 Objective: Protect market agents against 
price uncertainty 
 Make revenue streams more predictable 
 Facilitate investment decisions 
 Practice: Dominant form of transaction 
 Physical vs. financial contracts 
 Either private (although at least quantities must be 
declared in physical contracts) or through organized long-
term markets 
 The spot market as an adjustment mechanism to solve 
differences between contracted amounts & as a reference 
for other transactions 

26 

13 

The short-term (spot, typically day-ahead) 
market 
 In most market models there is a short-term (typically 
day-ahead) market that provides the reference price for 
the remaining transactions 
 Key issue is the potential for arbitraging between markets 
 Why such a diversity of auction formats?  
 Bids: simple, complex, continuous, iterative 
 Dispatch: self-committed, centralized, zoom 
 Network: single node, zonal, nodal 
 Trade-off in market design: simplicity & transparency 
versus efficiency & avoidance of risk  

27 

Intraday markets 
 Intraday markets make it possible to adjust 
(by adding new transactions, without modifying the 
previous ones) the contracted positions in the 
daily market 
 In case of occurrence of unexpected events 
(generator failure, demand deviation) 
 In case of difficulty in following the schedule of 
the daily program 
 Arbitrage between markets (although the regulator 
may want to reduce it to a minimum) 

28 

14 

Ancillary services 
 Use market mechanisms whenever possible 
 Typically mandatory: frequency response (primary 
reserve) 
 Markets typically: secondary & tertiary reserves 
 Possible limited markets: reactive power, system 
restoration 
 Wide diversity of contracting time horizons 
 Secondary & tertiary reserves:  
 separate prices for capacity & energy use 
 may provide resources for balancing market 

29 

Balancing market 

 The criticality & volume of this market may be 
reduced with a zoom of short-term markets 
 The price could be related to the use of 
secondary & tertiary reserves 
 Most powers markets rely much on it (UK) 
while others basically avoid it (Spain, just a 
penalty applied to deviations) 
 ISO may adopt emergency measures (e.g. ad 
hoc markets) whenever considered necessary 

30 

15 

Issues in market organization 
Demand side bidding 

 Demand participation is a basic ingredient of the 
second generation of power exchanges, but it is still 
mostly passive 
 Incentives & mechanisms are needed so that 
purchasers 
 estimate the demand correctly 
 buy as economically as possible 
 experience the uncertainty of the pool price and want to 
hedge against it 
 have the means of hedging the risk of lack of supply, if 
they so wish 

31 

Issues in market organization 
Firmness of transactions 
 A series of markets converging to the real time, 
each of them with firm transactions, seems to be 
the currently preferred option 
 All accepted transactions are firm in quantity & price 
 Successive markets allow the agents to approximate 
their buy/sell positions to their current best estimates 
 Same firmness rule applies in all (long-term, short-
term, real time) markets 
 The energy actually bought or sold by an agent in a given 
period of time is composed of several transactions, each 
one of them with its quantity & price 

32 

16 

Issues in market organization 
Long-term security of supply 
The questions 
 Can system short-term marginal prices 
remunerate the total costs of all plants? 
 Can consumers choose their level of reliability 
of supply? 
The proposed solutions 
 Leave it to the market 
 Regulated capacity payments 
 Capacity markets 
 Price risk-hedging contracts 

Issues in market organization  
Information disclosure 

 Market information must be accessible to all 
interested parties without discrimination 
 Trade-off between 
 availability of complete market information 
 example: disclosure on the following day of all 
accepted & non accepted bids 
 potential for collusion  

33 

34 

17 

Issues in market organization  
Codes of good practice 
 Implicit (most frequent) or explicit (e.g. the 
Single Electricity Market in Ireland) is a 
central piece in the regulatory compact 
 Competition by itself is not a deterrent against 
anticompetitive behavior is actual markets 
 A basic understanding of what is permissible 
(legal) or not is necessary

Typical functions of a Power 
Exchange 

 Reception of bids 
 Elaboration of the merit order 
 Computation of the market price 
 Centralization and processing of measurement data 
 Economic settlement 
 Market supervision (support to regulator) 
 Proposal of modification of market rules

Characterization of Power 
Exchanges 
 Market participation 
 Trading timing 
 Traded products / trading periods 
 Bid and offer format 
 Trading methods / pricing criteria 

Market participation 

  Participation can be: 
•  Compulsory - in a gross market (“Pool”) 
•  Voluntary – in a net market for surpluses & deficits 
  All PXs in the EU are voluntary 
•  Participation may be compulsory for some types of 
trading (e.g. inter-zonal trading in Nordic countries should be 
effected through Nord Pool) 
•  Some entities may be required to use PXs for part of the 
energy they trade (e.g. the Single Buyer in Italy or a 
prescribed % in OMEL for long-term contracts) 
•  Participation is mandatory in ISOs & RTOs in the US 
  Diversity of roles for demand (load/LSE) 

22 

Timing of trading 
  PXs are generally centered around a Day-Ahead Market 
(DAM), where electricity is traded the day before the day 
of delivery 
  Longer-Term Markets are generally based on financial 
products 
  Some PXs also provide Adjustment Markets for  modifying 
commitments deriving from the outcome of the DAM: 
•  improving on suboptimal results of the DAM 
•  reflecting new information (unplanned outages, ...) 
  Examples of Adjustment Markets: 
•  NordPool: Elbas Market 
•  Spain: six Intra-day Market sessions, each covering the 
remaining delivery periods of the day of delivery 
•  Italy: Adjustment Market immediately after the DAM 
(participation limited to generators) 
•  Germany: continuous trading 

Bid and offer format (1 of 4) 
  Simple bids/offers: 
•  Bids and offers consist of price-quantity pairs and are 
submitted independently for each delivery period 
•  The market equilibrium for a delivery period is 
determined independently from the market 
equilibrium for other delivery periods 
  Complex bids and offers: 
•  Bids and offers specify constraints covering more 
than one delivery period 
•  The market equilibria for different delivery periods 
are interrelated 

23 

Bid and offer format (2 of 4) 

Simple bids/offers 
  Bid:  
•  one or more quantity-price pairs, each specifying 
the maximum price at which the participant is 
willing to buy the corresponding quantity of 
electricity 
  Offer:  
•  one or more quantity-price pairs, each specifying 
the minimum price at which the participant is 
willing to sell the corresponding quantity of 
electricity 

Bid and offer format (3 of 4) 
 Complex bids/offers 
•  Generators could bid: 
 Technical minima (minimum output) 
 Non-divisible blocks 
 Start-up costs 
 Ramp constraint 
 Minimum revenue requirement 
•  Generators and load/LSE could bid: 
 Block bids/offers: bids/offers for a number of 
consecutive delivery periods in a standard 
format 

24 

Bid and offer format (4 of 4) 
PROS and CONS of Simple and Complex Bids/Offers 
  Simple Bids/Offers: 
•  Simpler and more transparent determination of the market 
outcome 
•  Offers only imperfectly reflect generators’ costs (cid:736) generators 
bear some risk and (cid:736) market outcome may be suboptimal/
technical unfeasible 
•  Subsequent (adjustment) markets may provide opportunities to 
modify commitments arising from the outcome of simple-bids/
offers DAMs 
  Complex bids: 
•  Offers may reflect actual costs more accurately (cid:736) reduced risk 
for generators and (cid:736) optimal/feasible market outcome easier to 
achieve 
•  Computationally more complex and less transparent 
determination of market outcome 
•  Computation of the system marginal cost requires some adjustment to 
reflect the impact of the start-up and no-load prices 

Details 
Auction-based trading with simple bids 
  Bids and offers for each delivery period are submitted by a 
specified deadline 
•  Merit orders are compiled: 
  Bids are ranked in descending price order 
  Offers are ranked in ascending price order 
•  The (equilibrium) market outcome is defined by the 
equilibrium market price (EP) 
•  The EP is the price at which the cumulative quantity specified 
in the merit order of bids is equal to the cumulative quantity 
specified in the merit order of offers 
•  Bids specifying a price not lower than the EP are accepted 
•  Offers specifying a price not higher than the EP are accepted 
•  Accepted bids and offers are valued at: 
  the EP (single-price auctions, this is the common 
procedure) 
  the price specified in each bid/offer (discriminatory or 
“pay-as-bid” auctions, rarely used)

Continuous bilateral trading 

  Bids and offers for a specified delivery period are 
submitted at any time during the trading session 
•  As soon as it is submitted, each bid/offer is matched, if 
possible, with offers/bids already submitted for the 
same delivery period and specifying compatible 
quantities and prices 
•  The execution price of a transaction is generally the 
price specified in the bid/offer submitted earlier 
•  If no match can be found, bids/offers are held and 
shown in the “trading book” to be matched with offers/
bids submitted later in the same trading session 

Comparison 

 PROs of trading methods/pricing criteria 
 Auction-based trading 
•  Maximises value of transactions (cid:736) facilitates 
efficient dispatching 
•  Single equilibrium price reference 
•  Allows integrated congestion management 
 Continuous bilateral trading 
•  Analogous to financial markets trading 
•  Participants can “see” the market before 
trading 

28 

US competitive wholesale markets 
 Most US wholesale markets have a similar 
structure 
 Locational marginal pricing (LMP): Prices vary by 
location when transmission constraints bind & also 
because of losses 
 Multi-settlement system: A day-ahead financial 
market & a real-time physical system 
 Day-ahead (24 h) is based on complex bids & unit 
commitment 
 Real time (5 min) is based on an optimal load flow 
 New England, New York, PJM, MISO, California 
 Texas is planning an LMP market 
 SPP has a locational imbalance market 

US wholesale markets 
Longer-term views 
 Transmission networks are planned at ISO 
level & recently there are coordination efforts 
at interconnection level 
 Some ISOs have set long-term resource 
adequacy requirements for generation 
  New England & PJM have an auction-based forward 
capacity market (4 years in advance) 
  New York has a demand-curve based monthly capacity 
market

 Contracts may be: 
•  Customised (bilateral)  
 Respond to the requirements of 
counterparties 
•  Standardised (anonymous) 
 Standard features and clauses 
 Easier to negotiate 
 Easier to trade in a secondary market

31 

Contracts for differences (CfD’s) 
 The best known example of a risk hedging 
instrument are the CfD’s 
 Two way contract: 
•  q amount of contracted energy 
•  Pm spot price (pool price) 
•  Pc contract price (strike price): the expected pool price 
•  Option fee OF (risk premium), not needed in a CfD 

<the table shows directly the amount received by each agent.> 

63 

Contracts for differences (CfD’s) 
Deviations & incentives 
 Viewpoint #1: Price Pc for contracted amount qc is 
guaranteed, but deviations are priced at market price Pm 
 Effect of deviations (a generator): 
 contracted amount qc 
 produced amount qp 
 Revenue: qc x Pc + Pm x  (qp - qc) 
 qp - qc subject to pool price risk 
 If the CfD is signed by a physical generator who makes 
its production qp equal to the contracted amount qc, 
then it is totally hedged (but a pure speculator with no 
production is fully exposed to the CfD contract risk) 

64 

32 

Contracts for differences (CfD’s) 
Deviations & incentives 
 Viewpoint #2: The implications of the CfD contract 
qc x (Pc – Pm) and the participation in the market (if 
this is the case) with production qp at a price Pm are 
examined separately 
 Final economic settlement (a generator): 
 contracted amount qc 
 produced amount qp 
 Revenue: qc x (Pc – Pm) + qp x Pm 
 qp is totally exposed to pool price risk 
 The existence of the CfD contract should not 
modify the behaviour of the generator in the spot  
market 

65 

Vesting contracts 

 Established at privatisation or restructuring 
 Usually an obligation imposed by the regulator 
 Make transition easier and less risky 
 Regulated price, which may be different  from market 
conditions 
 Example: Transitory protection of high cost domestic fuel 
 Reduce incentives for pool price manipulation 
 Since price manipulations can only affect the revenues for 
the non-contracted output 
 Reduced over time to increase room for the market 
 For the market of contracts, since the spot market is not 
affected

Bilateral Contracts: the EFET* Example 

  General Agreement (GA) governing Individual Contracts 
(ICs) 
  GA customisation through the Election Sheet (ES) 
  IC could be: 
•  Fixed price 
•  Floating price 
•  Call Option 
•  Put Option 
  ICs confirmed through a Confirmation of Individual 
Contract (CIC) 
  Cross Border Annex (jurisdiction and taxation issues) 

This is the model contract proposed by the European Federation of Energy 
Traders (EFET), widely used in the EU 

Content of EFET General Agreement (1) 

  § 1 Subject of Agreement

Organized forward & futures  markets  
Financial (derivatives) trading (1) 

 Prices in wholesale electricity markets vary from 
trading period to trading period, as a result of demand 
– supply interaction and transmission capacity 
 Participants are exposed to the risk resulting from the 
variability of revenues/costs from selling/buying 
electricity 
 As in financial markets, electricity derivative 
instruments provide risk hedging 

71 

Organized forward & futures  markets  
Financial (derivatives) trading (2) 

 Non tradable contracts 
 CfDs are difficult to trade 
 Adapted to parties’ requirements, non standard 
 Non centrally settled, each party bears default risks 
 Tradable contracts 
 Standard terms, non adapted to parties’ requirements 
 Centrally settled, when traded through organized market 
 Favour trading liquidity

Organized forward & futures  markets  
Financial (derivatives) trading (3) 

 Purely financial transactions  
 do not need to close in a physical shorter-term market  
 allow the participation of agents without physical assets that 
are backing the transaction  improve liquidity   
 Organized long or medium-term markets will only 
develop if the underlying market price is reliable 
 Types of instruments: 
 Forwards 
 Futures 
 Options 

73 

Organized forward & futures  markets  
Financial (derivatives) trading (4) 
 Forward contracts commit the buyer to purchase 
and the seller to deliver a specified quantity of 
electricity at a specified time in the future, at a pre-
determined price (delivery price) 
 Future contracts are standardised forwards contracts 
traded in organised and regulated exchanges 
 Option contracts give the buyer the right, but not 
the obligation, to purchase (“call options”) or to deliver 
(“put options”) a specified quantity of electricity at a 
specified time in the future, at a pre-determined price 
(strike price) 

74 

37 

Detail: 
Call & put options 
 Call option 
 A right to buy at a given price 
 The option seller compensates the option buyer if 
pool price is higher than strike 
 Put option 
 A right to sell at a given price 
 The option seller compensates the option buyer if 
pool price is lower than strike price 
 Similar to one-side contracts for differences 
(CfD = buy a call and sell a put) 

75 

Bilateral contracts without a daily spot 
market 
 The NETA (New Electricity Trading Agreement) in 
England & Wales started in March 2001 
 bilateral transactions are matched at a mutually 
agreeable  price, both using over-the-counter & 
organized future markets 
 any mismatches between the contracted amounts 
and the actual ones must be solved in a balancing 
market that opens only 1 hour before real time  

76 

38 

Trading and delivery 

 Trading results in long/short positions 
•  Long (physical) positions assign the right/
obligation to withdraw power from the grid 
•  Short (physical) positions assign the right/
obligation to inject power into the grid 
•  Long and short (physical) positions resulting 
from trading should be balanced (injections 
= withdrawals) in each delivery period 

Traded volumes of electricity derivatives 
may well exceed physical consumption 

* - No PX-trading of derivatives. ^ - Data on OTC Brokered volumes not available

Ancillary services 

79 

Ancillary Services 

  Primary (Frequency) Control – maintenance of the balance 
between generation and demand using turbine speed 
generators 
  Secondary (Load-Frequency) Control – centralised 
automatic function to regulate the generation in a control 
area in order to: 
•  maintain exchanges with other control areas at the 
programmed levels 
•  return the frequency to its set value in case of a (major) 
frequency deviation, thus restoring primary control reserve 
  Tertiary Control – automatic or manual change of working 
point of generators (mainly by re-scheduling) to restore an 
adequate secondary control reserve 
  Black-start Capability – the ability of a generating unit to 
start operating and delivering power without assistance 
from the electric system 
  Reactive Power – inject or withdraw reactive power to 
keep system voltage within prescribed levels at specific 
nodes 

40 

Trading Mechanisms 
 Provision of ancillary services is managed by the 
System Operator (SO) 
 Ancillary services can be: 
• Provided directly by the SO (e.g. Voltage control 
through capacitors) 
• Supplied by grid users according to licence 
conditions (e.g. Primary reserve) 
• Procured by the SO through long-term contracts 
(e.g. Black start capability) 
• Procured by the SO through dedicated markets (e.g. 
Secondary reserve) 
 Ancillary services are public goods (they cannot be 
provided selectively to grid users) 

Example 
Operating reserves in Spain 

 Mandatory services 
 Primary reserves 
 Minimum  reactive  power  support  (no explicit remuneration 
to transmission facilities) 

 Market mechanisms for voluntary services 
 Secondary and tertiary reserves 
 Contracts for system restoration 
 Contracts for extra reactive power support 

82 

41 

Example 
Operating reserves in Spain 
Secondary reserves 
  Required bands  (MW up & down) are  specified  for each hour 
by the System Operator after the daily market closes 
  Generators  may  bid  prices  ($/kW)  &  bands  (kW)  to  go  up  & 
down 
  Selected  bands  are  paid  the  resulting marginal  price  ($/kW) 
& the cost is charged to consumers as an uplift 
  All energy  used  in  secondary  regulation  is  paid  the  price  ($/
kWh)  of  energy  of  tertiary  reserves  &  the  cost  is  charged  to 
the  agents  (generators  or  consumers)  who  use  secondary 
reserves  (deviations  between  scheduled  and  real  energy, 
both generators and consumers) 

83 

Example 
Operating reserves in Spain 

Tertiary reserves 
  After  the  daily  market  closes,  any  capable  agent  may  bid 
blocks of energy & prices ($/kWh) to go up & down 
  The System Operator establishes an economic priority list and 
uses the bids if needed 
  All used bids (& only them)  in a given hour are paid the price 
of the last used bid in that hour ($/kWh) 
  The  cost  is  charged  to  the  agents  (generators  or  consumers) 
who use  tertiary  reserves  (deviations between scheduled and 
real energy, both generators and consumers)

Network effects 

85 

Typical functions of a system operator 

 Assessment of ancillary services requirements 
 Procurement of ancillary services. 
 Elaboration of the final dispatch 
 network constraint management 
 account for physical contracts 
 Operation of the transmission network 
 Transmission expansion planning from the entire 
system’s viewpoint 

86 

43 

Typical transmission functions 

 Network expansion planning (from the transmission 
company’s viewpoint) 
 Network construction 
 Maintenance planning (in coordination with the SO) 
 Maintenance of transmission facilities 
 Direct operation of transmission facilities 

87 

A very specific case 
Locally constrained-on generators 

 When generation must be constrained-on because of 
a network constraint, there is typically very little 
room for competition (typically just one company can 
solve the problem) 
 Preferred: Regulated remuneration or contracts 
(difficult to cover all possibilities) 
 Also: Pay-as-bid, under regulator’s surveillance & 
subject to competition law 

88

The general situation 
Management of losses & congestions 

 Option A: nodal (or zonal) prices 
 automatic solution to losses & constrained-off 
generators 
 more complex auction algorithm 
 Option B: single node 
 loss & congestion signals are sent separately 
 loss factors modify payments in settlement 
 auction is followed by congestion management 
no economic rights for constrained-off generators 

89 

Congestion 

  Congestion occurs when the available transmission 
capacity is not sufficient to satisfy the demand for 
transmission services (e.g., from commercial 
transactions) 
  Therefore, congestion depends: 
•  on the demand for transmission services 
•  on the available transmission capacity 
  Liberalisation has increased and made more explicit 
the demand for transmission services 
  Congestion may occur: 
•  within a control area 
•  between control areas (cross-border) 

-- 

45 

Approaches to congestion management 

Basic approaches: 
  Ex-post adjustment of market outcome 
•  Redispatching 
•  Counter-trading 
  Ex-ante congestion management 
•  Explicit allocation of (physical) transmission capacity 
rights (PTRs) 
•  Implicit allocation of transmission rights (and energy 
positions):  
 Implicit Auction 
 Market Splitting 
 Market Coupling (market splitting between 
different PXs)

46 

Congestion management (2) 

Explicit allocation of (physical) transmission rights (PTR) 
 Market-based allocation:  
 Auctions 
 PTR are allocated to the highest bidders in the auction, up to the 
available transmission capacity 
 the price each assignee pays for the allocated PTR depends on the 
auction design (single price, discriminatory auction, …) 
 Non market-based allocation:  
 First-come-first-served 
 PTR are assigned according to the chronological order of requests 
 Pro rata allocation 
 PTR are assigned proportionally to the amount requested, up to the 
available transmission capacity 

93 

Congestion management (3) 

Implicit allocation of transmission capacity 
 This happens when available transmission capacity 
is used to allow: 
 Access to an organised WEM by participants located 
on the other side of a congested interconnector 
(implicit auction) 
 Trading between two areas of an organised WEM 
separated by a congested interconnector (market 
splitting) 

94

From National to Regional or EU-wide 
markets in the EU 

  Historically, the European grid has been developed 
mainly to serve national markets 
  ... at a time when national markets were typically 
served by vertically-integrated monopolists 
  ... which had little incentive to integrate markets, 
except for security and stability purposes 
  Therefore, regional market integration requires: 
•  Harmonisation of rules 
•  Expansion of cross-border capacity 
•  Efficient management of existing capacity 

Congestion management in Europe 

  Most cross-border congestion in the EU is managed 
though explicit auctions (EU Regulation n. 1228/2003 
requires market-based solutions), except: 
•  NordPool: market Splitting between Norway, 
Sweden, Finland, Denmark East and Denmark West 
•  Trilateral Market Coupling between France, Belgium 
and the Netherlands 
•  Mibel: market splitting between Portugal and Spain 
•  Market Splitting in the Irish Single Electricity Market 
•  Market Coupling (EMCC) between Germany and 
Denmark West (AC link) and between Germany and 
Denmark East (Kontek DC link) 

48 

From RIs to a true EU IEM 
  The magnitude of the challenge is worth noticing: 
coordinated congestion management at EU-wide level 
  7 Regional Initiatives (RIs) were created to remove barriers 
to trade & achieve a high level of harmonization just among 
neighboring countries 
 with the expectation of integrating the RIs into a single EU 
IEM later 
  The success has been limited so far & the progress very slow 
  However, major advances have been recently made under 
the initiative of the Power Exchanges themselves see xxx 
  Progress towards a “seamless” operation among ISOs in the 
US has been very slow. Recent coordination efforts in 
transmission planning are encouraging 

99 

Tasks being addressed by the RIs 

  Coordinated transmission capacity calculation & utilization of a 
common network model 
  Towards a regional single auction platform, with harmonized 
rules, IT interface & products for medium & long-term 
allocation 
  Towards a market coupling model for the day-ahead timeframe 
  Towards an intra-day mechanism, possible based on 
continuous trading 
  Integration of balancing markets 
  Integration of transparency requirements
