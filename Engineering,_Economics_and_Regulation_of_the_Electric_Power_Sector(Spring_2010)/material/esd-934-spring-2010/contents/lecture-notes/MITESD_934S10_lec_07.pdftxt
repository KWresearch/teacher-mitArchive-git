What is to be optimized?

  The traditional objective of electric system planning 
& operation functions is to supply electricity demand 
at minimum cost with acceptable levels of 
reliability and environmental impact
(cid:14)  The concept of cost does not need much 
explanation
(cid:14)  Reliability means different things at different time 
scales & can be represented in diverse formats 
(cid:14)  Environmental impacts are multiple & difﬁcult to 
translate in terms of costs
The following slides on reliability have been adapted from a presentation by Prof. Andres Ramos 
(Master Power Sector, IIT, Comillas University)

Reliability aspects & criteria

 Reliability encompasses
(cid:1) Adequacy of installed capacity
(cid:1) Firmness of available capacity for operation
(cid:1) Security of available capacity to respond in real time
 No reliability index covers all aspects; typically 
indices represent
(cid:1) Number or frequency of failures
(cid:1) Duration of failures
(cid:1) Incidence of failures

Formats of representing reliability

Examples of reliability indices (i)  
A deterministic index
  Reserve Margin (RM):  
- Excess of generation capacity available to 
satisfy yearly load demand 

- Main characteristic is simplicity:  
•  Intuitive, easy to compute 
•  Limited because does not consider water 
reserves, sizes, technologies, or outage rates 

Examples of reliability indices (ii)  
Probabilistic indices

  Loss Of Load Probability (LOLP): 
-  This is the probability of being unable to satisfy all the 
demanded power with the available generation 
  Loss Of Load Expectation (LOLE): 
-  This is the expected number of hours or days in a year with 
insufficient generation (i.e., a measure of expected frequency, 
rather than a probability of failure) to meet the total demand: e.g. 
1 day in 10 years 

 29 

 30 

Examples of reliability indices (iii)  
Probabilistic indices

  Loss Of Energy Expectation (LOEE) widely known as 
Expected Energy Non Served EENS (Expected 
Unserved Energy EUE): 
-  It is defined as energy expected not to be supplied in a year because of 
generation unavailability or by lack of primary energy 
  Loss Of Energy Probability (LOEP): 
-  It is defined as probability of not supplying one kWh with the available 
generation 
-  As it is expressed in per unit, it allows to compare systems of different 
sizes

Economic dispatch 

This section is based on Chapter 5 of “Electric energy systems; 
Analysis and operation”, edited by A. Gómez-Expósito et al., 
CRC Press, 2009

Economic dispatch

  The economic dispatch (ED) problem 
consists in allocating the total demand 
among generating units so that the 
production cost is minimized
  The allocation is made basically on real-
time (1 to 5 minutes time horizon; ED may also 
set guidelines on which units have to address 
primary frequency control)

 33 

 34 

Economic dispatch

  Each generating unit is assigned a 
function, Ci(PGi), characterizing its 
generating cost in $/h in terms of the 
power produced in MW, PGi, during 1 h
  This function is obtained by multiplying 
the heat rate curve, expressing the fuel 
consumed to produce 1MW during 1 h, 
by the cost of the fuel consumed during 
that hour. 

Economic dispatch
  The cost function is generally approximated by a 
convex quadratic or piecewise linear function 

 35 

 36 

Economic dispatch: Problem formulation

The Economic Dispatch problem consists of minimizing the 
total production cost of n generating units 

with respect to the unit generation outputs, PGi, 
subject to the power balance

where Ploss are the transmission losses,
and subject to the generating unit operational limits,

Accounting for network effects

  We should rather learn about the network 
ﬁrst, and then we can introduce the most y 
convenient approximations

Load flow 

This section is based on Chapter 3 of “Electric energy systems; 
Analysis and operation”, edited by A. Gómez-Expósito et al., 
CRC Press, 2009

Load ﬂow
  The power system is assumed to be stable & at 
rated frequency. The “load ﬂow” is like a snapshot of 
the power inputs, outputs & ﬂows in the network
  The load ﬂow is the workhorse of power system 
networks operators & planners
  The load ﬂow problem consists of determining the 
value of all signiﬁcant variables in a power system 
network:  
(cid:14)  node voltages in magnitude U & angle θ 
(cid:14)  active power P & reactive power Q ﬂows in lines & 
transformers
(cid:14)  active power P & reactive power Q supplied by 
generators & consumed by loads

 45 

Load ﬂow: Problem statement
  Power system with 
(cid:14)  nL load nodes (PQ buses) where both the active Psp & 
reactive Qsp power are speciﬁed; unknowns are the voltage 
magnitude V & angle θ at the node
(cid:14)  nG generation nodes (PV buses) where the active power Psp 
power is speciﬁed by some higher economic function & the 
generator can maintain the voltage at some speciﬁed value 
Vsp; unknowns are the injected reactive power Q & angle θ at 
the node
  As the network losses resulting from the line ﬂows are not known 
a priori, at least the active power P at one node (some arbitrarily 
chosen slack bus) cannot be speciﬁed; if N is the number of 
nodes in the system then 
nG + nL = N - 1

 46 

Load ﬂow: Problem formulation

where
Gij & Bij: elements of the admittance between the buses i & j 
θij: difference between the voltage angles θi & θj at the buses i & j
Solving the load ﬂow consists of ﬁnding the set of phase angles θi, i=1, 
2, . . . , nL +nG, and the set of voltage magnitudes Vi, i=1, 2, . . . , nL, 
satisfying these 2nL +nG equations. 
As the resulting equation system is nonlinear, its solution necessarily 
involves an iterative process, for which adequate initial values should be 
given to the state variables.

DC load ﬂow
A reasonable linear approximation to the nonlinear load ﬂow equations 
is the so-called DC load ﬂow. It is assumed that Vi =1 at all buses 
(reactive power ﬂows & voltage differences are ignored) the load ﬂow 
equations become
Pij = Gij(cos θij − 1) + Bij sin θij
Further simpliﬁcations
cos θij ≈1 & sin θij ≈θi −θj
Bij = xij/(r2ij + x2ij) ≈ 1/xij
lead to the simple & linear expression
Pij = (θi − θj)/xij
only in terms of the reactances of the branches, the voltage angles & the 
branch active power ﬂows. 
Although the DC model is lossless, actual power losses can be estimated 
in terms of active power ﬂows by coveniently adding terms of the form 
Rij.Pij2

Even simpler approximations

In some cases the size of the model or the lack of sufﬁcient information 
on the network justify even further simpliﬁcations of the network 
representation. 
A model that has been frequently used makes only use of the ﬁrst 
Kirkhoff ’s law, i.e. the equality of the sum of the power ﬂows entering 
each network node to the sum of the power ﬂows exiting the same node. 
Constraints on the maximum ﬂows for each individual line could be 
added to the model.  

Optimal load flow 

This section is based on Chapters 5 & 6 of “Electric energy 
systems; Analysis and operation”, edited by A. Gómez-
Expósito et al., CRC Press, 2009

 51 

Optimal load ﬂow (OPF)

  The objective of the OPF is the same as for the 
ED, but now the network is explicitly included in 
the model
  Industrial OPFs typically include some kind of 
contingency analysis (preventive security control) 

 52 

Optimal load ﬂow: Problem formulation

Minimize PG, θ

Optimal load ﬂow: Problem formulation with 
DC load ﬂow approximation

 53 

 54 

Additional features of actual OPF algorithms

  In order for the outcome of an OPF to be qualiﬁed 
as “secure”, it has to be able to maintain this status 
against predictable changes (demand & 
generation evolution) & unpredictable events 
called contingencies
 OPF must include 
(cid:14) Operating reserves
(cid:14) Operating constraints that are derived from 
contingency analysis of potential transmission 
failures

Unit commitment

 59 

Unit commitment: problem formulation
The minimization extends now over p time periods (24 hours or more, up 
to a week, typically). The operating status of a generating unit is then 
expressed by the couple (PGi, ui), where u can be 0 (unit off) or 1 (unit 
on). The generating limits of unit i, PminGi and PmaxGi , are multiplied 
by the binary variable ui. And every time ui changes from 0 (unit off) to 1 
(unit on) the start-up cost C0i is incurred.  In this formulation network 
effects are ignored.
Minimize (u, PG)   Σp

Midterm generation planning
•  Objective
–  To obtain the minimum-cost optimal schedule of the 
generating units in order to satisfy the supply-demand 
balance equation and subject to all the other constraints of 
the system (technical, environmental, regulatory, etc.)
–  This model could be adapted for a market participant: 
maximum proﬁt.
•  Planning...
–  the operation
•  To ﬁnd the signals for the short-term models.
•  To estimate the share of each generation technology in 
the ﬁnal dispatch
–  economical
•  To forecast the operational and marginal costs. This is 
very relevant when preparing the annual budgets.

 63 

Midterm generation planning
  Typical modeling hypothesis:
(cid:14)  It is not necessary to model the transmission 
network
(cid:14)  It is not necessary to model the  hourly 
chronological evolution of the system:
•  Use a representation based in load blocks &/or load 
duration curves
(cid:14) Thermal plants start-up or shutdown decisions 
are only made in the transitions from working 
days to weekends, and vice versa.
(cid:14)  It is not necessary to consider a detailed 
representation of hydroelectric systems

Major modeling options

 Uncertainty is of essence in the annual 
horizon: Two approaches that can be 
combined
(cid:1)Decomposition in time periods & deterministic 
scenarios to represent hydro uncertainty, with 
possibility to include sequential decision making
(cid:1)Less detail in time period decomposition & 
“probabilistic simulation” to represent demand, 
hydro input & unit failure uncertainties

Scenarios  
Generation availability
  All generators can suffer an unforeseen 
failure and become unavailable
  In the deterministic approach for the 
midterm, the possible failure of unit t 
will be modeled by reducing its 
maximum output power, according to a 
equivalent availability coefﬁcient: gt  
[p.u.]

 69

Market models versus centralized 
optimization models
• In a market environment the possible 
applications of models is very diverse
• Market clearing algorithms for spot markets 
might be seen as ED or UC by replacing cost by 
bids (only in auctions with complex bids; short-term 
markets may adopt many different formats)
• Models may be used by an individual market 
agent to determine its strategy for bidding, 
contracting or investing
• Or by regulators or individual market agents to 
estimate the future behavior of the market for 
any given time range

Market models in imperfect markets

  Optimization models focus on the proﬁt 
maximization problem for one of the ﬁrms that 
compete in the market
  Equilibrium models represent the overall market 
behavior where all participants compete
  Simulation models are an alternative to equilibrium 
models when the problem to solve is too complex
  Models can be also classiﬁed based on: level of 
competition, time scope, uncertainty modeling, 
interperiod links, transmission constraints or 
market representation
