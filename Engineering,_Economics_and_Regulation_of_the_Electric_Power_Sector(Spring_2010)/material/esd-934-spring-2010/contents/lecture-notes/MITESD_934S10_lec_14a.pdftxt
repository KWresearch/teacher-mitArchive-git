The problem to be addressed 

 Producers & consumers in a national market 
have the right to buy & sell electricity freely ... 
 How much to charge for the use of the network? 
 Who pays for network losses? 
 What to do if the network is congested? 
 Who upgrades the network when needed? 
 and, how to address these same issues in a 
regional market?

Nodal prices 

 Nodal  prices  are  short-term  marginal  costs  of  energy 
with  locational  differentiation  so  that  they  internalize 
the network effects (losses & congestions) 
 “The nodal price at a node k is the increment in the 
operating cost of the system when the demand at node k 
increases by one unit”   

15 

Spot prices 
The underlying theory 
 Definition of spot price: Short term marginal 
cost of electricity production, with spatial and 
time discrimination 

 The value of (cid:83)k depends on 
 available generation and transmission equipment 
 operating conditions 
 load level 
 generation outputs 
 network losses 
 active network constraints 
 marginal cost of generating units

How to compute nodal prices? 
Formulation 

 Now, the only element in the Lagrangian function 
related with dk is in the constraint associated to the 
generation-demand balance for node k. 
 Therefore: 

The spot price for node k is the shadow price of the 
balance constraint for that node.  

Simple to calculate & widely used. 

26 

13 

On the use of nodal prices 

 Motives (founded or not) that are sometimes employed 
to justify why not to use nodal prices 
 they are volatile or difficult to compute 
 in  well  developed  networks  the  differences  between  nodal 
prices at different nodes are irrelevant most of the time 
 zonal prices are enough for location differentiation 
 they  are  not  compatible  with  uniform  tariffs  (if  this  is  the 
case) 
 There are alternative procedures to apply efficient short-term 
location  signals  while  maintaining  a  single  energy  price  for 
the entire system 

27 

Nodal prices 
Regulatory implications (i) 

  Nodal prices are optimal short-term economic signals 
for consumers & generators 
  Nodal prices internalize all network effects in the economic dispatch / 
wholesale market of generation & demand 
  Note that nodal prices are energy prices, to be applied to 
energy bought & sold by consumers & generators, 
respectively &, in principle, they are not meant to cover the 
costs of the transmission activity. However, the application of 
nodal prices results in an economic surplus, whose meaning 
will be examined next 

14 

Nodal prices 
Regulatory implications (ii) 

 Application of nodal prices can be interpreted 
as if the transmission network company “buys” 
electricity at the input end of each line (typically 
at a lower nodal price) & sells electricity (different 
amount, because of losses) at the output end of 
each line (typically at a higher nodal price) 
 This results in a total net surplus 

Nodal prices 
Regulatory implications (iii) 
 Alternatively, application of nodal prices, when 
considering the entire transmission network 
altogether, can be viewed as if the transmission 
network “buys” electricity at the nodes where 
generation injects electricity to the network and 
“sells” electricity at the nodes where load is 
withdrawn from the network  

 It can be easily verified that both expressions are 
identical 

15 

Nodal prices 
Regulatory implications (iv) 
 Then,  when  nodal  prices  are  applied  to  all  network 
users: 
 All  of  them  will  receive  correct  short-term  economic 
signals 
losses  & 
internalize  network 
fully 
that 
constraints 
 In  well  developed 
the 
transmission  networks 
application  of  nodal  prices  results  in  a  net  income  that 
typically  recovers  a  small  fraction  of  the  total  network 
costs (about 15% to 25% typically) 
 However,  it  can  be  proved  that  a  “perfectly 
adapted  transmission  network”  would  completely 
recover its network costs with nodal prices 

31 

Nodal prices 
Regulatory implications (v) 
 The reason for the net surplus to be typically short of the 
required revenues is that the condition of “perfect 
adaptation” of a transmission network is not possible in 
practice, since 
 Actual investment options are discrete 
 There are strong economies of scale 
 Network expansion is subject to reliability constraints that 
may not have a sound economic justification 
 Other constraints: financial, environmental 
 “Mistakes” in network planning 
 even if the network design is the “optimal” one (although 
subject to the mentioned constraints)

Regulatory implications 
 The “complementary charge”: 
 both the theoretical reasons and the practical experiences 
indicate that variable network charges fell short of 
covering the total network costs 
 network revenues must be regulated to be independent of 
variable network charges, in order to avoid perverse 
incentives for the network entity 
 therefore a complementary charge is needed to fill the 
gap: 

required network revenues = 
= network variable charges + 
+ complementary charge

Transmission 
Regulatory characterization 

 Transmission is a natural monopoly 
 Large economies of scale 
 The entire network is operated as a whole 
 Enormous difficulties in duplicating the network 
 Competition appears to be possible in very limited 
cases (e.g. merchant lines in very congested areas) 
 Unregulated transmission ownership would provide 
much market power 
 Transmission effects: losses, congestions, costs 
47 

Implications 

 A well developed network (as those that exist in 
America & Europe, in most cases) will never be the 
outcome of “merchant” investment exclusively 
(whose only income comes from congestion rents) 
 The role of “merchant lines” is limited to 
 Large generation projects that need the line 
 Zones with systematic congestions that do not go away 
with the considered network investment 
 Special investments where the private investor & the 
centralized planner have a different risk perception
