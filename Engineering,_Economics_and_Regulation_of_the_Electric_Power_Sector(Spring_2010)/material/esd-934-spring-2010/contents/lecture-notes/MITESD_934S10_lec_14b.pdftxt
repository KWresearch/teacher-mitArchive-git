Subject to   

Gk, min ≤ Gk (p) ≤ Gk, max, k = 1,..., K 

Where 
p: individual plan 
P: set of all possible plans 
M: attribute to be minimized (e.g., total cost of supply 
G: result of each one of the k=1,...K technical/or reliability constraints that the plan has to 
meet 
Alternative: Heuristic search model

guarantee that the optimal plan is obtained

 STATIC MODELS 
 Only  the  final  year  of  the  considered  time 
horizon is analyzed 
 Only  models  that  seem  to  have  been 
actually used in practical applications 
 DYNAMIC MODELS 
 The  entire  time  horizon  is  simultaneously 
considered

Mono-Attribute static optimization model 
Solution by heuristic search 
Case example: CHOPIN 

  Formulation  
  Only discrete investment variables are considered in CHOPIN 
  Production cost & reliability models with DC network 
formulation 
  Solution method 
  The optimization of the investment subproblem is replaced by 
a heuristic search that consists in a truncated enumeration of 
the complete solution space (i.e., the set of all possible plans) 
  Investment restrictions are explicitly accounted for during 
the search: non feasible solutions are not accepted 
  The level of network modelling detail is not relevant for the 
performance of the algorithm  no restrictions to the use of 
DC (or even AC) models

CHOPIN 
Basic Philosophy of the search algorithm 

 Start from a user-provided reasonable plan (*) 
 Local search that is guided by 
 Sensitivities 
 heuristic rules 
 logic 
 experience from actual use of algorithm 
 Depth-first search 
 since truncation here is mostly based on extent of 
deviations from what locally appears to be the best 
decision 
 good solutions in limited time 

(*) Successful searches have been achieved in all cases even when starting from very poor initial plans 
21 

CHOPIN 
Classification of the investment variables 

 Questioned variables   
  Lines included by user in initial plan 
  User considers they may not belong to optimal plan 
  Initial value = 1 
 Attractive variables 
  Lines not included by user in initial plan  
  User considers they may belong to optimal plan 
  Initial value = 0 
 Frozen variables 
  Cannot change their initial values ( 0 or 1) fixed by user 
  During the search the questioned & attractive variables 
become frozen variables

CHOPIN 
Use of sensitivities in guiding the local search 

 Estimate of the cost/benefit ratio of an 
investment option: 

 Use A(Xl) to rank investment options 
according to potential interest      priorities in 
depth-first search 
 A(Xl) >1 
 consider for installation if attractive 
 A(Xl) ≤ 1 
 consider for removal if questioned

CHOPIN 
Global Truncation Criteria 

 Set upper limit to 

 number of evaluations 
 size (width, depth) of search space  
 number of "wrong steps"  

CHOPIN 
Local Stopping Criteria 

 Violation of investment constraints 

 No possibility of improvement on the 
currently best found plan 

 Exceed the allowed total volume of 
investment with any of the remaining 
open options

CHOPIN 
Utilization Guidelines 
(must be taylored to each system) 

 Approach phase 
 No horizontal branching 
 No limit to number of "wrong steps“ 
 Local search phase 
 Sequentially allow a maximum of 1, 4 & 8 
horizontal steps 
 No more than one "wrong step“ 
 Verification phase 
 Maximum of 4 horizontal steps 
 No more than 2 "wrong steps" 

31 

CHOPIN 
Critical Evaluation 

  Strong points  
  No restrictions to the level of modeling detail or nature of 
restrictions 
  Computationally very efficient (1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster 
than PERLA) 
  Successful application in large practical systems 
  Invariably CHOPIN has produced the optimal solution (there is no 
evidence against this, despite the efforts made to disprove it ) in 
all cases 
  Weak(?) points: 
  There is no guarantee that the solution provided by CHOPIN is 
the actual optimal plan (this is also true for any other algorithm 
when applied to general non linear optimization problems)
