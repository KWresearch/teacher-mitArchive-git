Two Types of Emissions Trading

Credit Trading, or Baseline-and-Credit
Credit for over-control of some specified standard 
usable to excuse under-control elsewhere
Trading in differences from pre-existing standard
Allowance Trading, or Cap-and-Trade
Trading in limited “rights” from the “bottom up”
No prescribed standard for individual sources
Sources respond to the “new price” by reducing 
emissions where internal cost < market price

Evolution of Emissions Trading

• Credit Trading has evolved out of conventional 
regulation to provide flexibility
– Pre-existing standard (baseline) already in place
– High transaction costs have limited use
– Now, more project, off-system reductions
• Allowance Trading is radically different
– Decentralized, self-contained property rights system
– Emerged in the U.S. out of political stalemate
– Far more successful than expected

A Closer Look at the 
Cap-and-Trade Mechanism

• An absolute limit is decided for the environmental problem
• Emitters issued tradable permits = “cap” < previous emissions
• A fundamentally different “command” to the firm
– Measure and report emissions and 
– Surrender allowances = emissions
– No prescribed practice, technology, reduction, etc.
• Tradability enables market and single price to coordinate 
efficient abatement actions (equal marginal cost)

Three Unique Features

• Rights to emit must be created and allocated
– Unique in being explicit and transparent
– Free allocation to auctioning to “cap-and-
dividend”
• Emissions must be measured and reported
– Radical innovation in environmental regulation
• Maintenance of Registry or Tracking System
– Analogous to a check-clearing system

Some History (1)

• Early credit-based trading (U.S., late 1970s-1980s)
– Some cost savings, but generally disappointing
• Leaded-gasoline phase-down (US: 1985-86)
– 1st program w/o individual approval; successful
• Los Angeles RECLAIM Program (1994-
)
– SO2 and NOx; local; multi-sector
• US Acid Rain (SO2) Program (1995-
)
– Canonical cap-and-trade, very successful
– National scope, power plants only

Some History (2)

)

• OTC/NOx Budget Program (1999-
– Regional, mostly power plants
)
• EU ETS (2005 -
– First CO2 and multi-national system
– Largest cap-and-trade market and program
)
• Kyoto Protocol (2008 -
– Government trading; essentially voluntary
• Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (2009 -
)
– 1st mandatory US program; very low prices

What have we learned?

• More effective and lower cost than conventional 
regulation
– Firms do respond to prices
• Many new, unexpected ways to reduce emissions
– Many more ways than could be mandated
– No favored approaches/technologies
• Cheapest reductions tend to where there are the most 
emissions: “Dirtier is cheaper”
– A matter of amortizing fixed costs: Paid by the ton

The Allocation Problem

• Cap creates a scarcity rent embodied in 
allowances. Who should receive it?
• Prior Use Claims—incumbent emitters
– Also, compensation and political uses
• Public Use Claims—the government
– Expenditures or tax/debt reduction
• Cap-and-Dividend—Per capita to households
• Always recycled. Issue is how & to whom?

Free Allocation 
vs. Auctioning
• The usual dichotomy in allocation debate
– Allowance value to gov’t or corporations
– Auctioning often coupled with “double 
dividend”
• But ignores who is the ultimate recipient
– Both govt and corp are legal shells
– Quite different distributional outcomes
• US debate now focused on ultimate recipients

Cost Implications

• Free allocation raises opportunity cost issue
– Typically fixed and historical; independent 
of current emissions or production
– Allowance use incurs an opportunity cost
– Do emitters recognize opportunity cost?
• Straight-forward with auctioning/purchase
– Pay as for any other input into production

Interaction with Electric 
Power Regulation
• Liberalized power markets      marginal cost pricing
– Allowance cost incorporated into price
– Free allocation over-compensates assuming
opportunity cost is recognized and passed on
• Cost-regulated markets      average cost pricing 
– Only incurred costs are included
– Free allocation reduces consumer price effect

Summary
• A known, tested, and tried concept
– Creates a price on emissions and reduces emissions with few 
other side effects
• A highly desirable form of environmental 
regulation
– Radically different from conventional “command-and-
control”
– Object is to reduce and limit emissions only
– Trading is means for least-cost compliance, 
– Profit is by-product, not the object of trading
