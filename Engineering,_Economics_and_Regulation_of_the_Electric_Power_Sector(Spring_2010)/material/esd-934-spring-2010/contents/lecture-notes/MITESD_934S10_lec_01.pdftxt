Session 1. Wednesday February 3, 2010 

Introduction 

Prof. Ignacio J. Pérez-Arriaga 
 

 

Do you agree with this rule?

“On Oct. 23, 2009, FERC approved a MISO interim 
proposal for spreading costs associated with network 
upgrades that are needed to accommodate new 
generation interconnection. Under the new scheme, 
generators will pay 100% of the interconnection costs 
for lines below 345kV and 90% for facilities at or above 
345kV (with the extra 10% paid by all of MISO), a  cost 
that is too high for the wind generators, the national 
wind association contends” .

Does this make sense to you?

The availability of credits can be further 
complicated by potential economic mechanisms, 
whereby coal plants “may choose to limit 
operating hours in order to sell their emission 
credits as green house gas constraints increase”
Terry Boston, President and CEO of PJM Interconnection in 
Norristown, PA, in reference to the potential distortions that CO2 
emissions could bring to the electricity market. 
(Excerpt from NERC 2008 Climate Initiatives report)

Some questions
  Should cogeneration be subsidized?
  Why so little investment in transmission lines took 
place in the US for more than a decade, until 
recently? Should anybody do something about it or 
should it be left to market forces?
  Should the remuneration of distribution utilities be 
linked to the level of quality of service that they 
provide?
  Are smart meters a good idea? Are the potential 
beneﬁts worth the cost & trouble of changing the 
present meters?
  How to compute electricity tariffs?

 4 

More questions

  Should the purchase of electricity be liberalized as 
the telecom service or a regulated tariff is ﬁne?
  How to detect if agents in a wholesale electricity 
market are abusing any market power they might 
have? Can this market power be mitigated 
somehow?
  Can investment in generation capacity be left 
entirely to the market or some kind of intervention 
is warranted?
  What is going on in the electricity sector around 
the world? Are liberalization & markets really 
working?

 5 

And still more questions
  Are the “standard tax credits” that are presently 
used in the US a sound mechanism to promote 
generation from renewable sources such as wind?
  Why the feed-in tariffs of Germany, Denmark & 
Spain are so successful? Or are they maybe too 
successful? Is there a fool-proof method to 
promote renewables?
  Can one rely on markets to achieve sustainability 
objectives? How to mix markets & public policies?
  Has the worldwide liberalization process been 
successful in increasing the rate of electriﬁcation 
for the one third of mankind without access to 
electricity? What is the right approach?

What this course is not (1 of 2)

  6.691. Seminar in electric power systems
(cid:14)  Focus is on detailed engineering aspects of modeling 
power devices & systems
  6.061. Introduction to electric power systems
(cid:14)  A sound engineering power systems course, with no 
economics or regulatory content
  14.44. Energy economics & policy
(cid:14)  Focus is on economic models & instruments for a variety 
of sectors (including electricity; requires signiﬁcant economic 
background)

 7 

What this course is not (2 of 2)
  1.801. Environmental law, policy & economics: 
Pollution prevention & control
(cid:14)  Focus is on legal & general environmental aspects 
  1.816/11.369. Energy policies for a sustainable future
(cid:14)  More general, less emphasis on regulation, all energies 
instead of just power systems

 8 

What this course is about

  Basically restricted to the electric power sector
  Covers technological, economic & legal aspects, 
without a formal treatment of any one of them
  Focus (& this is the spinal cord of the course) is on 
regulatory aspects, thus making use of 
engineering, economy & law
(cid:14)  No formal training in any of these matters is required, 
although it is very welcome
  Addresses current open issues in the regulatory 
practice & research

 9 

Logistics
  Introductions
  Classroom (speak up!)
  Syllabus
  Resources, books on reserve
  Recitations 

  Homework, Term paper (and marathon day)
  Grading
  Visit to ISONE
  Slides (more in handout than shown in class)
  Ofﬁce hours 
  Punctuality (the class will start /  ﬁnish¿? on time)

Homework 1

  Select one power system of interest to you, preferably 
within the provided list
  During the course you will have to learn about it, analyze 
it under different viewpoints and suggest improvements 
to its regulatory framework. It may used also in the term 
paper
  This ﬁrst assignment just consists of making your choice 
and writing a few pages (a couple of pages is enough) with 
the system you have chosen, reasons for it  and the 
sources of information that you have found so far
  Get familiar with the “Resources” document

11

 11 

Term paper

  Options 
1.  Individual
•  From a list of prescribed topics
•  Exceptionally: a studentʼs proposed topic
2.  Team (groups of 3), a large case study with N topics to 
be prepared/defended individually/collectively

Electric power systems  
The different perspectives
•  A power system (or the electric power industry) 
can be contemplated from a diversity of 
perspectives
– In the 1st part of module A (today) we shall focus on 
the physical description & some engineering aspects
– In the 2nd part of module A (next day) we shall look at 
how it is managed & regulated: a mix of economic, 
engineering & also legal issues
– However, the course will concentrate on regulatory 
issues
•  regulation of the several activities involved in the 
supply & consumption of electricity will be the 
common thread that we shall follow during the course

18

Outline (1 of 2)

•  Background
– A ﬁrst global impression 
– Whatʼs so special about electricity?
– A bit of history of the sector
•  The technological perspective
– Generation
– Transmission
– Distribution
– System operation, protection & control
– The environmental impact

Outline (2 of 2)

•  The economic & managerial perspectives
– Economic data & orders of magnitude
– Time scales
• Expansion planning
• Operation planning
• Operation
• Protection & control

19

20

Whatʼs so special about electricity?
•  Electricity is an essential (public?) service
– guarantee of supply & price are politically sensitive issues
•  Electricity cannot be easily stored, i.e. delivery is 
practically instantaneous
– Generation & demand are permanently in balance
•  Supply  of electricity requires networks, where 
electricity is injected or retrieved but cannot be 
traced
– Network duplication does not make economic sense
•  Also (not so special)
– Large & dedicated investments
– Complex decision making under much uncertainty
– Predictable cyclical variations in demand

21

Some history of the sector

•  Scale: ﬁrst electric light systems  (individual, DC) (1870), 
larger (collective, DC) (1882)
•  Voltage: 100 V DC (1882), 15 kV AC (1884), 3 phase 
AC (1891), 150 kV (1910), 245 kV(1922)
•  Large interconnected systems (UK, 1926, ~ 500 plants)
•  Vertically integrated plus small distributors
– From local, private & unregulated, to large regulated 
monopolies with or w/o state intervention
•  50 & 60 cycles/sec frequency 
•  Mostly stable model until 1990s  unbundling + 
liberalization

Electricity demand & GDP
•  Numerous statistics show the close 
relationship between GDP growth (or 
reduction) & electricity demand growth (or 
reduction) , in basically all countries
•  But GDP & electricity consumption are not 
the same in all countries
–  The next slides show that difference
–  They also show that “too much ” electricity 
consumption does not help to improve the 
level of human development
–  And, most importantly, they show that below a 
threshold in electricty consumption is not 
possible attain a minimum level of 
development
