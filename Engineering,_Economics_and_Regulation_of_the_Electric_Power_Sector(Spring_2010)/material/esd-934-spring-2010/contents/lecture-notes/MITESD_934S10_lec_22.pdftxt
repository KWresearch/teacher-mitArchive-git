The EU Internal Electricity Market (IEM) 
Objectives & challenges 

 The objective 
 An operating Internal Electricity Market (IEM) 
where electric energy is delivered at the lowest 
cost that is compatible with a satisfactory quality 
of supply & environmental sustainability 
 The challenge 
 How to implement it, taking the initial existing 
situation as the starting point

Specific issues in 
regional electricity 
markets 

5 

Markets integration 
An international trend 
 Regional markets integrating several national 
markets are becoming a common practice all 
over the world 
 Economic efficiency and security of supply  
 Relevant international experiences: 
 European Union (IEM, including NORDEL, MIBEL, 
SEM), ISO/RTO markets in the US (after Standard 
Market Design), Central America (MER), South America 
(MERCOSUR and the Andean market), Australia, South 
Africa, Mekong, Nile, etc.  

6

Market integration benefits 

  Higher efficiency and (hopefully) lower environmental 
costs– Efficient and environmental friendly generation replaces 
less efficient generation 
  Increase power system security: larger systems are more 
robust against system contingencies if control areas are well 
coordinated 
  Increase security of supply: primary energy sources are more 
diversified 
  Increase competition in generation and supply 
 Wholesale market (increase size of the relevant market) 
 Retail market (higher possibilities to choose supplier) 

7 

Regional institutions and 
regulation 
 Political willingness and compromise among governments 
 Legislation at the top level: Treaties, Directives,… 
 Creation of Regional Institutions or Associations: Energy 
Regulators, Transmission System Operators (TSO), Power 
Exchanges (PX),…  
 Regulatory principles for regional integration 
 Transparent and non discriminatory regulation  
 Competition as market driver 
 Free energy exchanges using transmission interconnections 
 Free third party access to networks 
 Harmonization of national regulations to meet regional 
agreements and legislation

Key elements in the design a 
regional market 
 Long process with continuous political support 
 Key issues with several maturity stages: 
 Development of regional market legislation and 
harmonization of national legislations 
 Creation of regional market institutions 
 Development of required interconnection capacities  
 Market mechanisms to reserve interconnection capacity and 
joint congestion management procedures 
  Transmission cross-border tariffs 
 Single market paradigm: the outcome of the regional 
regulation should approach as much as possible a sound 
regulation for a single system of regional dimension 

9 

Objectives for a regional 
electricity market 
 A market really encompassing the entire region 
 A truly competitive market in electricity & gas 
 For energy, capacity, ancillary services & retail markets 
 Efficient free entry & investment 
 Efficient cross-border trading 
 Acceptable security of supply 
 Efficient & non-discriminatory electricity prices 
that foster regional competitiveness 
 The regional market as a key component of a 
sustainable energy model for the region 

10 

5 

Design of a regional electricity market 
Regulatory challenges (1) 
 Market structures suitable for competition 
 Insufficient interconnection / Horizontal 
concentration / Vertical integration / Diagonal 
integration / Incomplete market opening / Barriers 
to entry & to switching supplier 
 Adequate guarantee of supply in primary 
energy sources & generation investment 
 Adequate rules to share the common 
transmission network 
 Investment, access & pricing issues 
 Efficient & non-discriminatory electricity 
tariffs & prices all over the region 

11 

Design of a regional electricity market  
Regulatory challenges (2) 
 Sustainability of the energy model  
 Radical support of renewable energy sources 
  Efficient financial mechanisms 
  Incorporation of a large volume of intermittent & 
non-controllable energy sources in system operation 
 Aggressive policy of energy saving & efficiency 
 A minimum level of harmonization 
 Previous items / CO2 emissions trading / market 
rules for cross-border trade / promotion of 
renewables / balancing mechanisms / market 
information / other 

12

Design of a regional electricity market  
Regulatory challenges (3) 

 Any feasible implementation scheme cannot 
ignore two critical facts 
 In the medium term (at least) there is a limit to 
harmonization: for instance, the EU IEM 
encompasses 27 countries with different 
regulations & pace of liberalization, with several 
functioning PEXs, etc.   
 the laws of physics in system operation 

13 

But let’s start from the beginning… 
The struggle to 
establish a EU energy 
policy 

7 

Some basic data & trends 

 Evolution & current trends (1990 to 2030)  
 Liquid fuels (38% in 2000): absolute growth, slight 
reduction in %. Transport is key 
 Natural gas (23% in 2000): absolute & % growth 
 Solid fuels (18% in 2000): absolute & % reduction; 
possible change 
 Nuclear (14% in 2000): absolute & % reduction. Debate 
 Renewables (6% in 2000): strong absolute & % growth 
 CO2 emissions: trend to increase after 2010 
 Energy intensity: diminishing steadily 
 Energy dependence: 45% (1990) to 68% (2030) 

15 

Towards a EU energy policy (1 of 3) 

 After much indecision, the EU has recently established 
important regulation  
 Inspired by sustainability & with the classical objectives of 
security, economy & environmental concern 
 Reduction 2020/1990 of CO2 emissions by 20% (30% if 
international consensus)  
 Improvement of 20% of efficiency in consumption 
 Target of 20% of renewables in final energy consumption 
(approx. 40% of electricity production) 
 Implementation of the GHG Emission Trading Scheme, 
more than 10 Directives & Regulations approved in 2009, 
standards for appliances, sustainability criteria for biofuels, 
instruments to support clean technologies, etc. 
16 

8 

Towards a EU energy policy (2 of 3) 

 Creation of new institutions with EU-wide reach 
 Agency for Cooperation of Energy Regulators, ACER 
 Framework for national regulators to cooperate 
 Regulatory oversight of the cooperation among TSOs 
 Individual decision powers (without normative decisions) 
  Exemption requests for infrastructure assets 
  Regulatory regime concerning cross-border infrastructure 
  Specific decisions when established by any Guidelines under 
comitology procedure 
 General advisory role 
 European Network of TSOs, ENTSO 

17 

Towards a EU energy policy (3 of 3) 

 Still contradictions & obstacles exist  
 The need for consensus in “energy matters” 
 Member States have exclusive competence on the 
technology mix 
 Latent conflict between two opposing models: 
  “liberal” (more competition, market integration, collective security, 
multilateralism) 
  “nationalistic” (more traditional regulation, self-sufficiency, national 
security, national champions, bilateral relations) 
 Potential lack of maturity for an integrated management & 
a common foreign policy 
 Ambiguity in nuclear energy, insufficient interconnection 
policy, weaknesses in competition law & institutions

A cursory review of a 
few topics of relevance 
for electricity markets 

The topics 

 Who is in charge? 
 Compatibility of markets & public energy 
policy 
 Regional initiatives: A seamless EU IEM? 
 Transmission network expansion 
 Other topics not covered here: new paradigms in 
system operation, EU competition enquiry, energy 
R&D, the EU approach to “smart grids” 

20 

10 

Who is in charge? 
(the story of the Inter-TSO payments) 

Development of cross-border 
trade regulation 
 Progress has been difficult with so many institutions & 
viewpoints, lack of effective decision-making procedures 
& no clear sense of direction 
The overall approach might work, but very slowly 
 A case example: Inter-TSO payments 
 Countries compensate one-another for the utilization of 
their networks 
 A procedure is needed to quantify “network utilization” 
 The net balance of compensations & charges for each 
country is added to its total network cost from which 
transmission tariffs are computed 
 The national network charge gives access to the entire EU 
22 

11 

A little history (1 of 4) 
 First EU Electricity Directive (1996) 
 Ambiguous. Transmission charges could be negotiated or 
regulated. Scarce progress in market implementation 
 National independent regulators take the lead. The 
Florence Forum is born in 1998 
 The concept of the “single system paradigm” & complete 
EU-wide access with just local network charges plus inter-
TSO payments is agreed 
 But, how to implement it? Initial consensus results in a 
provisional & highly questionable method (March 2002) 
 Creation of ETSO, CEER, EUROPEX, EFET, etc. 

23 

A little history (2 of 4) 
 The ensuing debate 
 An endless debate to decide on a more sound & permanent 
method. How to reach a decision? Proposals by ETSO & 
some regulators. Positions aligned with national interests. 
Gridlock 
 2003 Directive establishes minimum requirements on 
 Network access, creation of wholesale markets, unbundling 
of activities, installation of new generation, consumer 
eligibility, role of regulators, etc.  

24 

12 

A little history (3 of 4) 
 But 2003 Regulation does not provide specific 
implementation criteria on 
 Harmonization of transmission charges, cross-border 
tarification, network congestion management, handling of 
long-term contracts, interconnection reinforcement  little 
guidance to solve the Inter-TSO compensation problem 
 Creation of ERGEG & extension of UE 
 Comitology with even more actors. Hopeless gridlock of 
regulators & TSOs with new proposals under request of EU 
Commission. Nobody is really in charge with executive 
power 

25 

A little history (4 of 4) 

 2009 Electricity Directive & Regulation  
 Creation of ENTSO & ACER 
 Still no executive power by ACER to approve regulation, & 
ENTSO has no regulation competence, but at least there 
will be institutions with true EU-wide mission & scope, & 
the technical capability & adequate internal procedures to 
produce meaningful proposals 
 & now the presentation of the current approach 
(which is conceptually sound)… 

26 

13 

What is an acceptable cross-
border trading scheme? 
 The “obvious” approach is wrong: 
 Treat each cross-border transaction CBT as a local 
generator or demand that is placed at the 
corresponding border node  this leads to tariff 
pancaking & lack of coordination in transaction 
management 
  economically inefficient 
  an obstacle to international trade 
  back to the basics

system paradigm”

For more information, see http://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse.

Cross-border tarification 

 “Single system paradigm” for transmission 
network pricing  
 Local connection charge (G, L) provides 
access to entire EU network 
  charges are independent on the commercial 
transactions 
  some transmission tariff harmonization should be 
achieved 

30 

15 

Cross-border tarification 
 Implementation 
 Pan-European access with local G & L charges 
  Implemented since March 2001 
•  An initial export fee was applied & eliminated two years later 
 Inter-TSO payments to compensate for external 
network use 
  A crude temporary scheme was adopted in 2001. The initial 
disagreement on the appropriate method to measure 
external network use, how to determine its cost & how to 
allocate the charges still persists 

31 

Cross-border tarification 

 Implementation (cont.) 
 no cross-border tariffs, but inter-TSO payments 
 with the net balance of inter-TSO payments each 
country modifies its internal G & L tariffs 
 Note that the final G & L tariffs are not 
transaction-based (& this is how it should be) 

32 

16 

Inter-TSO payments 
Computation 
 Step 1. Determine the compensation that 
is due to each country/TSO on the basis of 
the external use of its network & standard 
network & energy costs 
 Step 2. Determine the charges to be applied 
to each country/TSO because of its 
responsibility in the extra costs of other 
countries 
 Step 3. Application of the net balance of 
compensation & charges of a country/TSO to 
its internal network users 

33

How to make markets 
& public energy policy 
compatible? 

Some important questions 

 In the context that can be anticipated of strong 
sustainability & security oriented policy measures 
 How to improve / redesign market regulation to 
facilitate that these policies reach their objectives 
efficiently? 
 How to make these policy measures compatible 
with the functioning of electricity markets?  

See the special issue of The Energy Journal “The future of electricity: Papers in 
honor of David Newbery”, 2008, for a detailed elaboration on these issues 

36 

18 

First, indicative planning 

 What is intended to accomplish? (national & 
supranational energy policies require long-term analysis with 
sustainability criteria)  indicative planning (IP) 
 The IP procedure is meant to characterize meaningful 
energy development paths that meet any prescribed high 
level (sustainability & others) targets, in order to facilitate 
political decisions 
 Note that, once one path is chosen, IP 
  is more than just prospective analysis (find what could happen)  
  has normative character (identify what has to be done to make 
sure that a future with some desirable features happens) 

37 

EU Electricity Directive, 2009 

Art. 2: “… In relation to security of supply, energy efficiency/demand side 
management and for the fulfillment of environmental goals and goals for energy 
from renewable sources,  … Member States may introduce the implementation of 
long-term planning, taking into account the possibility of third parties seeking 
access to the system.” 

Art. 7.2: “Member States shall lay down the criteria for the grant of authorisations 
for the construction of generating capacity in their territory. In determining 
appropriate criteria, Member States shall consider: … (j) the contribution of the 
generating capacity to meeting the overall Community target of at least a 20 % 
share of energy from renewable sources in the Community’s gross final 
consumption of energy in 2020... and (k) the contribution of generating capacity to 
reducing emissions.” 

Art. 10: “Member States shall implement measures to achieve the objectives of 
social and economic cohesion and environmental protection, which shall include 
energy efficiency/demand-side management measures and means to combat climate 
change, and security of supply, where appropriate. Such measures may include, in 
particular, the provision of adequate economic incentives…” 
38 

19 

Regulatory challenges (1 of 2) 

 Choice of instruments to develop & deploy clean 
technologies (electricity generation & energy 
efficiency & conservation, ECE) to meet IP targets 
 Use market prices (of energy, emissions, green or white 
certificates) with as much internalization as politically 
possible 
 BUT while full internalization of sustainability implications 
is not achieved  use additional regulatory 
instruments (quotas, standards, incentives, cross-cutting 
policies) while trying to minimize market distortion 

39 

Regulatory challenges (2 of 2) 

 Choice of instruments to make possible a clean 
technology mix in electricity generation 
 Nuclear: if politically acceptable, it might need some 
regulatory commitment to reduce financial risks 
 Clean coal (CCS): presently only viable with regulatory 
support (until sufficiently high & stable CO2 prices exist) 
 Renewables: same; support scheme should depend on 
level of maturity of technology, cost & rules for integration 
in the market (which affect the economic viability of other plants) 
 Peaking plants: economic viability strongly depends on 
regulation of security of supply & intermittent generation 
 Reduced, but still significant, space for the market

From RIs to a true EU IEM 

 The magnitude of the challenge is worth noticing: 
coordinated congestion management at EU-wide 
level 
 7 Regional Initiatives (RIs) were created to remove 
barriers to trade & achieve a high level of 
harmonization just among neighboring countries 
 with the expectation of integrating the RIs into a single EU 
IEM later 
 The success has been very limited so far & the 
progress very slow

(e.g. the “Mediterranean Ring”) 

49

Tasks being addressed by the RIs 

  Coordinated transmission capacity calculation & utilization of a 
common network model 
  Towards a regional single auction platform, with harmonized 
rules, IT interface & products for medium & long-term 
allocation 
  Towards a market coupling model for the day-ahead timeframe 
  Towards an intra-day mechanism, possible based on 
continuous trading 
  Integration of balancing markets 
  Integration of transparency requirements 

25 

The way ahead (1 of 3) 

 Conceptually,  LMP,  locational  marginal  pricing  (nodal 
energy pricing) would the ideal solution 
 It is widely used in the USA, but only at RTO level 
 Generalized LMP does not seem to be a viable solution in the 
EU in the medium term 
 Although  the  incremental  contributions  of  mini-Fora 
and  RIs  have  been  meager,  they  have  been  probably 
useful in helping to create some conceptual consensus  
 Much  coincidence  now  between  ENTSO  &  EuroPEX,  as 
shown  in  its  recent  joint  report  with  a  very  limited  range  of 
alternative designs 

The way ahead (2 of 3) 

 Need for top-down guidance at this point 
 According  to  the  3rd  package,  this  should  result  from  ACER 
establishing  some  guidelines,  ENTSO  developing 
the 
corresponding  network  codes  following  the  guidelines,  ACER 
verifying  that  the  network  codes  are  in  compliance  with  the 
guidelines,  ACER  sending  the  network  codes  to  the 
Commission for approval.  
 The RIs can be useful in some aspects of the implementation 
process,  since  it  is  true  that  in  some  issues  it  suffices  with 
adopting  decisions  at  regional  level,  better  adapted  to  the 
specific  local  situation  and  with  no  further  implication  at  the 
broader  EU  level  (decentralized  RI  implementation  of  some 
measures of just RI scope)  

26 

The way ahead (3 of 3) 

 What can be done while ACER becomes operational? 
 ENTSO  &  EuroPEX  in  their  joint  report  propose  a  “Market 
integration  design  project”,  with  a  technical  body  and  a 
political one (the Steering Forum) 
  A “project” avoids creating any additional institutions (given that 
adequate ones have been already created in the 3rd package)  but  it 
allows continuing activities and making progress 
 Some  EU  Power  Exchanges  (PEX)  have  already  started 
merging  (German  EEX  &  French  PowerNext)  or  establishing 
advanced  PEX  coordination  schemes  (France,  Germany, 
Belgium, Netherlands, Nordel plus Portugal & Spain)  

Other actions at EU level 

 EU Commission has focused on regions where progress 
was slow & on priority European projects 
 The Priority Interconnection Plan (PIP) 
 A revision of the Trans-European Energy Network (TEN-E) 
guidelines. 
 A High Level Group was set up to speed up progress in the 
South West electricity region 
 EU coordinators for key energy infrastructure projects 
 3rd package contains a provisions to enhance market 
integration; harmonize the powers and independence of 
regulators at a national and EU level; increase transparency; & 
provide for effective unbundling  

27 

Transmission network 
expansion 

The challenge… 

 Despite the large geographical dimension of the EU IEM 
& open transmission access, there are not very 
significant transfers of electricity between regions 
  The interconnections between regions are frequently weak 
  Typically there are no major surpluses / deficits 
  Generation technologies at the margin are frequently similar 
 This situation will probably change with massive 
deployment of renewable generation, either internal or 
external 
 A comprehensive approach to transmission 
expansion has been lacking, as well as the 
institutional capability for an effective implementation 

56 

28 

…the sound regulatory approach 

 Transmission capacity expansion must be based on 
comprehensive planning studies, in principle  
encompassing the entire interconnected system 
 Responsibilities for planning, authorizing, siting & pricing 
should be clearly assigned  
 Pricing & remuneration of transmission should be 
transparent, low risk & convey efficient locational signals 
 Provide effective open transmission access 
 Adopt an advanced approach to system operation that 
properly addresses intermittency with state-of-the-art 
technology, integrating demand response & storage 

58 

29 

… some conflicting views 

 Large very-high voltage “overlays” (multiple major 
additions) versus incremental network development 
 Global broad planning perspective versus 
comprehensive utilization of local resources (typically with 
associated local side benefits) 
  Transmission expansion creates asymmetrical benefits & costs 
 Pros & cons of extending the scope of the tightly 
interconnected system 
  Increment of efficiency 
  Reduce impact of intermittency 
  Security of system operation  

59 

… and the EU regulatory response 

 Electricity Directive & Regulation, July 2009 
 Establish the participation of TSOs, collectively (ENTSO) & 
individually, the regulatory authorities, collectively (ACER) 
& individually, the Member States & the concerned 
stakeholders 
 Non mandatory EU-wide transmission expansion plan 
prepared by ENTSO /European Network of Transmission System 
Operators) & ACER (Agency for the Cooperation of Energy 
Regulators)  
 Mandatory national transmission expansion plan prepared 
by national TSO & approved & enforced by regulator

EU Electricity Directive & Regulation, 2009 

Art. 22. Network development and powers to make investment decisions. 

“Every year, transmission system operators shall submit to the regulatory authority 
a  ten-year  network  development  plan  based  on  existing  and  forecast  supply  and 
demand  after  having  consulted  all  the  relevant  stakeholders.  …The  regulatory 
authority  shall  consult  all  actual  or  potential  system  users  on  the  ten-year  network 
development plan in an open and transparent manner.” 

“When elaborating the ten-year network development plan, the transmission system 
operator  shall make  reasonable  assumptions  about  the  evolution  of  the  generation, 
supply,  consumption  and  exchanges  with  other  countries,  taking  into  account 
investment plans for regional and Community-wide networks.” 

Article  8(3)(b)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  714/2009:  “The  ENTSO  for  electricity  shall 
adopt:  …a  non-binding  Community-wide  ten-year  network  development  plan, 
(Community-wide  network  development  plan),  including  a  European  generation 
adequacy outlook, every two years…” 

61 

EU Electricity Directive & Regulation, 2009 

Article  8(11)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  714/2009:  “The Agency  (ACER)  shall  provide 
an  opinion  on  the  national  ten  year  network  development  plans  to  assess  their 
consistency  with  the  Community-wide  network  development  plan.  If  the  Agency 
identifies  inconsistencies  between  a  national  ten-year  network  development  plan 
and the Community-wide network development plan,  it shall recommend amending 
the  national  ten-year  network  development  plan  or  the  Community-wide  network 
development plan as appropriate.” 

Art. 22. Network development and powers to make investment decisions (cont.) 

“The regulatory authority shall examine whether the ten-year network development 
plan  covers  all  investment  needs  identified  during  the  consultation  process,  and 
whether  it  is  consistent  with  the  non-binding  Community-wide  ten-year  network 
development.  …The  regulatory  authority  may  require  the  transmission  system 
operator to amend its ten-year network development plan.” 

“Member  States  shall  ensure  that  the  regulatory  authority  is  required  to  take  at 
least  one  of  the  following  measures  to  ensure  that  the  investment  in  question  is 
made…” 
62 

31 

Is this response enough? 

 Institutions of European dimension (ENTSO & ACER) 
are responsible for developing transmission 
expansion plans of EU dimension 
 However, final decisions are left to national regulators & 
TSOs 
 And mandatory criteria for expansion are based just on
